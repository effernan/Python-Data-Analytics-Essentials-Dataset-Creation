326	336	338	339	Mr Dombey	190	“ The House will once again , Mrs Dombey , ”
341	354	356	356	he	190	“ be not only in name but in fact Dombey and Son ; ”
394	401	356	356	he	190	“ Dom - bey and Son ! ”
445	454	411	411	he	190	“ Mrs Dombey , my — my dear . ”
475	490	491	491	She	687	“ He will be christened Paul , my — Mrs Dombey — of course . ”
495	499	491	491	She	687	“ Of course , ”
517	551	553	554	Mr Dombey	190	“ His father ’s name , Mrs Dombey , and his grandfather ’s ! I wish his grandfather were alive this day ! There is some inconvenience in the necessity of writing Junior , ”
564	593	553	554	Mr Dombey	190	“ but it is merely of a private and personal complexion . It does n’t enter into the correspondence of the House . Its signature remains the same . ”
598	603	596	596	he	190	“ Dombey and Son , ”
1359	1384	1356	1356	he	190	“ Florence , you may go and look at your pretty brother , if you like , I daresay . Do n’t touch him ! ”
1438	1453	1458	1458	himself	190	“ Her insensibility is as proof against a brother as against every thing else , ”
1479	1534	1459	1459	He	190	” Next moment , the lady had opened her eyes and seen the child ; and the child had run towards her ; and , standing on tiptoe , the better to hide her face in her embrace , had clung about her with a desperate affection very much at variance with her years . “
1540	1548	1549	1556	A very ill - advised and feverish proceeding	729	” said Mr Dombey , rising testily . “
1580	1581	1574	1575	the person	731	” “
1619	1634	1617	1617	you	198	” he added , pausing for a moment at the settee before the fire , “
1647	1648	1644	1644	Mrs	734	” “
1653	1686	1688	1690	this young gentleman	733	” suggested the nurse , a simpering piece of faded gentility , who did not presume to state her name as a fact , but merely offered it as a mild suggestion . “
1695	1696	1692	1693	Mrs Blockitt	199	” “
1711	1712	1706	1707	Miss Florence	197	” “
1719	1740	1706	1707	Miss Florence	197	” said Mr Dombey , bending over the basket bedstead , and slightly bending his brows at the same time . “
1769	1906	1706	1707	Miss Florence	197	” As he thus apostrophised the infant he raised one of his hands to his lips , and kissed it ; then , seeming to fear that the action involved some compromise of his dignity , went , awkwardly enough , away . Doctor Parker Peps , one of the Court Physicians , and a man of immense reputation for assisting at the increase of great families , was walking up and down the drawing - room with his hands behind him , to the unspeakable admiration of the family Surgeon , who had regularly puffed the case for the last six weeks , among all his patients , friends , and acquaintances , as one to which he was in hourly expectation day and night of being summoned , in conjunction with Doctor Parker Pep . “
1911	1934	1909	1909	Sir	735	” said Doctor Parker Peps in a round , deep , sonorous voice , muffled for the occasion , like the knocker ; “
1950	1951	1936	1936	you	735	” “
1957	1979	1936	1936	you	735	” said the family practitioner faintly : bowing at the same time to the Doctor , as much as to say , “
1994	2044	1936	1936	you	735	” Mr Dombey was quite discomfited by the question . He had thought so little of the patient , that he was not in a condition to answer it . He said that it would be a satisfaction to him , if Doctor Parker Peps would walk upstairs again . “
2056	2062	2047	2047	We	742	” said Doctor Parker Peps , “
2117	2118	2078	2078	your	735	” “
2121	2133	2078	2078	your	735	” interposed the family practitioner with another inclination of the head . “
2137	2143	2164	2164	I	0	” said Doctor Parker Peps , “
2178	2179	2171	2171	I	0	” “
2184	2188	2191	2191	I	0	” murmured the family practitioner—“can’t
2209	2210	2200	2202	Doctor Parker Peps	198	” “
2214	2219	2212	2212	you	0	” said the Doctor , “
2256	2257	2212	2212	you	0	” “
2261	2267	2212	2212	you	0	” murmured the family practitioner . “
2271	2274	2212	2212	you	0	” assented the Doctor—“and
2306	2307	2302	2302	I	0	” “
2310	2316	2302	2302	I	0	” murmured the family practitioner . “
2325	2326	2327	2327	You	0	” “
2332	2338	2327	2327	You	0	” returned Doctor Parker Peps , “
2426	2427	2407	2410	the Countess of Dombey	754	” “
2430	2436	2407	2410	the Countess of Dombey	754	” said the family practitioner . “
2440	2446	2407	2410	the Countess of Dombey	754	” said Doctor Parker Peps . “
2450	2456	2407	2410	the Countess of Dombey	754	” said the family practitioner . “
2459	2465	2407	2410	the Countess of Dombey	754	” said they both together . “
2468	2479	2407	2410	the Countess of Dombey	754	” added Doctor Parker Peps , alone and very gravely , “
2492	2768	2769	2769	My	0	” With that , they stood for a few seconds looking at the ground . Then , on the motion — made in dumb show — of Doctor Parker Peps , they went upstairs ; the family practitioner opening the room door for that distinguished professional , and following him out , with most obsequious politeness . To record of Mr Dombey that he was not in his way affected by this intelligence , would be to do him an injustice . He was not a man of whom it could properly be said that he was ever startled , or shocked ; but he certainly had a sense within him , that if his wife should sicken and decay , he would be very sorry , and that he would find a something gone from among his plate and furniture , and other household possessions , which was well worth the having , and could not be lost without sincere regret . Though it would be a cool , business - like , gentlemanly , self - possessed regret , no doubt . His meditations on the subject were soon interrupted , first by the rustling of garments on the staircase , and then by the sudden whisking into the room of a lady rather past the middle age than otherwise but dressed in a very juvenile manner , particularly as to the tightness of her bodice , who , running up to him with a kind of screw in her face and carriage , expressive of suppressed emotion , flung her arms around his neck , and said , in a choking voice , “
2779	2780	2776	2777	a Dombey	756	” “
2785	2795	2800	2801	the family	9755	” returned her brother — for Mr Dombey was her brother—“I
2810	2811	2808	2808	Louisa	204	” “
2819	2834	2817	2817	me	0	” said Louisa , sitting down , and taking out her pocket - handkerchief , “
2845	2850	2841	2843	a perfect Dombey	758	” Mr Dombey coughed . “
2856	2871	2841	2843	a perfect Dombey	758	” said Louisa ; smiling through her tears , which indeed were not overpowering , “
2895	2896	2884	2884	I	0	” “
2906	2911	2904	2904	herself	205	” said Mr Dombey . “
2916	2917	2914	2914	Fanny	205	” “
2922	2926	2914	2914	Fanny	205	” returned Louisa , “
3061	3077	3078	3078	I	0	” Mr Dombey promptly supplied her with these refreshments from a tray on the table . “
3089	3093	3094	3094	I	0	” said Louisa : “
3125	3152	3121	3123	a perfect Dombey	758	” Quenching this expression of opinion in a short hysterical laugh which terminated in tears , Louisa cast up her eyes , and emptied her glass . “
3164	3168	3121	3123	a perfect Dombey	758	” she repeated , “
3227	3252	3253	3254	Mrs Chick	208	” These last words originated in a sudden vivid reminiscence of the baby . They were succeeded by a gentle tap at the door . “
3256	3265	3253	3254	Mrs Chick	208	” said a very bland female voice outside , “
3275	3276	3279	3279	Paul	192	” “
3281	3296	3279	3279	Paul	192	” said Louisa in a low voice , as she rose from her seat , “
3335	3367	3332	3333	Miss Tox	208	” The lady thus specially presented , was a long lean figure , wearing such a faded air that she seemed not to have been made in what linen - drapers call “
3370	3805	3806	3806	I	0	” originally , and to have , by little and little , washed out . But for this she might have been described as the very pink of general propitiation and politeness . From a long habit of listening admiringly to everything that was said in her presence , and looking at the speakers as if she were mentally engaged in taking off impressions of their images upon her soul , never to part with the same but with life , her head had quite settled on one side . Her hands had contracted a spasmodic habit of raising themselves of their own accord as in involuntary admiration . Her eyes were liable to a similar affection . She had the softest voice that ever was heard ; and her nose , stupendously aquiline , had a little knob in the very centre or key - stone of the bridge , whence it tended downwards towards her face , as in an invincible determination never to turn up at anything . Miss Tox ’s dress , though perfectly genteel and good , had a certain character of angularity and scantiness . She was accustomed to wear odd weedy little flowers in her bonnets and caps . Strange grasses were sometimes perceived in her hair ; and it was observed by the curious , of all her collars , frills , tuckers , wristbands , and other gossamer articles — indeed of everything she wore which had two ends to it intended to unite — that the two ends were never on good terms , and would n’t quite meet without a struggle . She had furry articles for winter wear , as tippets , boas , and muffs , which stood up on end in rampant manner , and were not at all sleek . She was much given to the carrying about of small bags with snaps to them , that went off like little pistols when they were shut up ; and when full - dressed , she wore round her neck the barrenest of lockets , representing a fishy old eye , with no approach to speculation in it . These and other appearances of a similar nature , had served to propagate the opinion , that Miss Tox was a lady of what is called a limited independence , which she turned to the best account . Possibly her mincing gait encouraged the belief , and suggested that her clipping a step of ordinary compass into two or three , originated in her habit of making the most of everything . “
3810	3820	3852	3853	Mrs Chick	208	” said Miss Tox , with a prodigious curtsey , “
3860	3893	3858	3858	Louisa	204	” Mrs Chick took Miss Tox ’s hand in hers , rested the foot of her wine - glass upon it , repressed a tear , and said in a low voice , “
3898	3899	3896	3896	you	0	” “
3905	3910	3902	3902	Louisa	204	” said Miss Tox , “
3920	3921	3917	3917	you	204	” “
3924	3929	3917	3917	you	204	” Mrs Chick returned . “
3954	3998	3934	3934	You	0	” Mr Dombey of course officiated , and also refilled his sister ’s glass , which she ( looking another way , and unconscious of his intention ) held straight and steady the while , and then regarded with great astonishment , saying , “
4009	4010	4005	4005	you	192	” “
4016	4026	4011	4012	Miss Tox	208	” pursued Mrs Chick , still retaining her hand , “
4082	4083	4076	4077	Miss Tox	208	” “
4088	4093	4086	4086	Louisa	204	” said Miss Tox . “
4099	4100	4086	4086	Louisa	204	” “
4113	4118	4086	4086	Louisa	204	” resumed his sister ; “
4160	4161	4162	4163	Miss Tox	208	” “
4168	4173	4162	4163	Miss Tox	208	” said Mr Dombey . “
4187	4213	4175	4175	I	0	” pursued his sister , pressing the foot of the wine - glass on Miss Tox ’s hand , at each of the three clauses , “
4238	4239	4236	4236	myself	0	” “
4245	4250	4236	4236	myself	0	” inquired her brother . “
4256	4260	4236	4236	myself	0	” returned Louisa . “
4273	4286	4236	4236	myself	0	” said Miss Tox in a tone of low and earnest entreaty , “
4362	4437	4438	4438	My	0	” Miss Tox made a graceful bend as she spoke , in favour of Mr Dombey , which that gentleman graciously acknowledged . Even the sort of recognition of Dombey and Son , conveyed in the foregoing conversation , was so palatable to him , that his sister , Mrs Chick — though he affected to consider her a weak good - natured person — had perhaps more influence over him than anybody else . “
4442	4459	4438	4438	My	0	” that lady broke out afresh , after silently contemplating his features for a few moments , “
4489	4490	4478	4478	you	192	” “
4493	4503	4478	4478	you	192	” said Mrs Chick , with a sweet smile , “
4512	4651	4507	4507	I	0	” It was a declaration in a Christian spirit , and Mrs Chick felt that it did her good . Not that she had anything particular to forgive in her sister - in - law , nor indeed anything at all , except her having married her brother — in itself a species of audacity — and her having , in the course of events , given birth to a girl instead of a boy : which , as Mrs Chick had frequently observed , was not quite what she had expected of her , and was not a pleasant return for all the attention and distinction she had met with . Mr Dombey being hastily summoned out of the room at this moment , the two ladies were left alone together . Miss Tox immediately became spasmodic . “
4669	4683	4660	4660	I	0	” said Louisa . Miss Tox ’s hands and eyes expressed how much . “
4693	4694	4660	4660	I	0	” “
4697	4706	4660	4660	I	0	” said Miss Tox , with deep feeling . “
4711	4712	4660	4660	I	0	” “
4721	4726	4727	4727	His	769	” said Miss Tox . “
4786	4791	4800	4800	him	769	” said Miss Tox . “
4802	4803	4800	4800	him	769	” “
4810	4819	4808	4808	Paul	192	” exclaimed his sister , as he returned , “
4831	4832	4833	4833	I	0	” “
4848	4849	4846	4846	Fanny	205	” “
4856	4862	4854	4854	Paul	192	” returned his sister rising , “
4918	4919	4912	4912	I	0	” “
4927	4934	4922	4922	I	0	” said Mr Dombey , stiffly , “
4943	4944	4945	4945	Nobody	795	” “
4968	4969	4970	4972	Ignorant and base	797	” “
4975	4981	4970	4972	Ignorant and base	797	” echoed Miss Tox softly . “
4984	4988	4970	4972	Ignorant and base	797	” pursued Louisa , “
5021	5044	5045	5045	she	205	” she continued , taking off her bonnet , and adjusting her cap and gloves , in a business - like manner , “
5071	5186	5064	5064	Paul	192	” Mr Dombey , who , besides being generally influenced by his sister for the reason already mentioned , had really faith in her as an experienced and bustling matron , acquiesced ; and followed her , at once , to the sick chamber . The lady lay upon her bed as he had left her , clasping her little daughter to her breast . The child clung close about her , with the same intensity as before , and never raised her head , or moved her soft cheek from her mother ’s face , or looked on those who stood around , or spoke , or moved , or shed a tear . “
5193	5200	5064	5064	Paul	192	” the Doctor whispered Mr Dombey . “
5211	5212	5064	5064	Paul	192	” “
5218	5229	5064	5064	Paul	192	” asked Mr Dombey . The Doctor shook his head . “
5236	5357	5358	5358	Fanny	205	” The windows stood open , and the twilight was gathering without . The scent of the restoratives that had been tried was pungent in the room , but had no fragrance in the dull and languid air the lady breathed . There was such a solemn stillness round the bed ; and the two medical attendants seemed to look on the impassive form with so much compassion and so little hope , that Mrs Chick was for the moment diverted from her purpose . But presently summoning courage , and what she called presence of mind , she sat down by the bedside , and said in the low precise tone of one who endeavours to awaken a sleeper : “
5362	5396	5360	5360	Fanny	205	” There was no sound in answer but the loud ticking of Mr Dombey ’s watch and Doctor Parker Peps ’s watch , which seemed in the silence to be running a race . “
5402	5411	5397	5397	Fanny	205	” said Mrs Chick , with assumed lightness , “
5483	5511	5475	5475	you	205	” She bent her ear to the bed , and listened : at the same time looking round at the bystanders , and holding up her finger . “
5514	5518	5522	5522	you	205	” she repeated , “
5533	5557	5527	5527	I	0	” No word or sound in answer . Mr Dombey ’s watch and Dr Parker Peps ’s watch seemed to be racing faster . “
5566	5593	5562	5562	Fanny	205	” said the sister - in - law , altering her position , and speaking less confidently , and more earnestly , in spite of herself , “
5676	5701	5702	5702	Fanny	205	” The race in the ensuing pause was fierce and furious . The watches seemed to jostle , and to trip each other up . “
5704	5716	5702	5702	Fanny	205	” said Louisa , glancing round , with a gathering alarm . “
5750	5814	5815	5815	Mama	212	” The two medical attendants exchanged a look across the bed ; and the Physician , stooping down , whispered in the child ’s ear . Not having understood the purport of his whisper , the little creature turned her perfectly colourless face and deep dark eyes towards him ; but without loosening her hold in the least . The whisper was repeated . “
5817	5867	5868	5868	Mama	212	” said the child . The little voice , familiar and dearly loved , awakened some show of consciousness , even at that ebb . For a moment , the closed eye lids trembled , and the nostril quivered , and the faintest shadow of a smile was seen . “
5870	5877	5868	5868	Mama	212	” cried the child sobbing aloud . “
5886	5984	5986	5987	Mrs Chick	208	” The Doctor gently brushed the scattered ringlets of the child , aside from the face and mouth of the mother . Alas how calm they lay there ; how little breath there was to stir them ! Thus , clinging fast to that slight spar within her arms , the mother drifted out upon the dark and unknown sea that rolls round all the world . CHAPTER II . In which Timely Provision is made for an Emergency that will sometimes arise in the best - regulated Families . I shall never cease to congratulate myself , ”
5989	6030	5986	5987	Mrs Chick	208	” on having said , when I little thought what was in store for us,—really as if I was inspired by something,—that I forgave poor dear Fanny everything . Whatever happens , that must always be a comfort to me ! ”
6135	6146	6148	6149	Mr Chick	213	“ Do n’t you over - exert yourself , Loo , ”
6151	6186	6148	6149	Mr Chick	213	“ or you ’ll be laid up with spasms , I see . Right tol loor rul ! Bless my soul , I forgot ! We ’re here one day and gone the next ! ”
6207	6212	6213	6213	she	208	“ I am sure , ”
6216	6283	6213	6213	she	208	“ I hope this heart - rending occurrence will be a warning to all of us , to accustom ourselves to rouse ourselves , and to make efforts in time where they ’re required of us . There ’s a moral in everything , if we would only avail ourselves of it . It will be our own faults if we lose sight of this one . ”
6301	6307	6310	6310	himself	213	“ A cobbler there was ; ”
6337	6351	6353	6354	his helpmate	815	“ Which might be better improved , I should think , Mr C. , ”
6361	6391	6353	6354	his helpmate	815	“ than by the introduction , either of the college hornpipe , or the equally unmeaning and unfeeling remark of rump - te - iddity , bow - wow - wow!”—which
6415	6422	6424	6425	Mr Chick	213	“ Merely habit , my dear , ”
6427	6432	6434	6435	his wife	9766	“ Nonsense ! Habit ! ”
6437	6487	6434	6435	his wife	9766	“ If you ’re a rational being , do n’t make such ridiculous excuses . Habit ! If I was to get a habit ( as you call it ) of walking on the ceiling , like the flies , I should hear enough of it , I daresay . ”
6516	6523	6525	6526	Mrs Chick	208	“ Bow - wow - wow ! ”
6538	6557	6525	6526	Mrs Chick	208	“ More like a professional singer with the hydrophobia , than a man in your station of life ! ”
6558	6566	6568	6569	Mr Chick	213	“ How ’s the Baby , Loo ? ”
6576	6583	6585	6586	Mrs Chick	208	“ What Baby do you mean ? ”
6588	6595	6597	6598	Mr Chick	213	“ The poor bereaved little baby , ”
6600	6612	6597	6598	Mr Chick	213	“ I do n’t know of any other , my dear . ”
6613	6622	6624	6625	Mrs Chick	208	“ You do n’t know of any other , ”
6627	6639	6624	6625	Mrs Chick	208	“ More shame for you , I was going to say . ”
6645	6675	6640	6641	Mr Chick	213	“ I am sure the morning I have had , with that dining - room downstairs , one mass of babies , no one in their senses would believe . ”
6676	6682	6684	6685	Mr Chick	213	“ One mass of babies ! ”
6695	6704	6706	6707	Mrs Chick	208	“ It would have occurred to most men , ”
6709	6730	6706	6707	Mrs Chick	208	“ that poor dear Fanny being no more,—those words of mine will always be a balm and comfort to me , ”
6737	6746	6732	6732	she	208	“ it becomes necessary to provide a Nurse . ”
6747	6752	6754	6755	Mr Chick	213	“ Oh ! Ah ! ”
6757	6776	6754	6755	Mr Chick	213	“ Toor - ru!—such is life , I mean . I hope you are suited , my dear . ”
6777	6783	6785	6786	Mrs Chick	208	“ Indeed I am not , ”
6788	6873	6785	6786	Mrs Chick	208	“ nor likely to be , so far as I can see , and in the meantime the poor child seems likely to be starved to death . Paul is so very particular — naturally so , of course , having set his whole heart on this one boy — and there are so many objections to everybody that offers , that I do n’t see , myself , the least chance of an arrangement . Meanwhile , of course , the child is — ”
6874	6880	6882	6883	Mr Chick	213	“ Going to the Devil , ”
6887	6892	6882	6883	Mr Chick	213	“ to be sure . ”

7264	7269	7271	7272	Miss Tox	208	“ My dear Louisa , ”
7274	7281	7271	7272	Miss Tox	208	“ is the vacancy still unsupplied ? ”
7282	7289	7291	7292	Mrs Chick	208	“ You good soul , yes , ”
7294	7301	7303	7304	Miss Tox	208	“ Then , my dear Louisa , ”
7306	7326	7303	7304	Miss Tox	208	“ I hope and believe — but in one moment , my dear , I ’ll introduce the party . ”
7497	7505	7481	7481	he	833	“ kitch hold of his brother Johnny . ”
7509	7514	7516	7517	Miss Tox	208	“ My dear Louisa , ”
7519	7544	7516	7517	Miss Tox	208	“ knowing your great anxiety , and wishing to relieve it , I posted off myself to the Queen Charlotte ’s Royal Married Females , ”
7676	7677	7663	7663	I	0	” “
7687	7691	7679	7682	the dear good Tox	844	” said Louisa . “
7696	7701	7679	7682	the dear good Tox	844	” returned Miss Tox . “
7772	7785	7769	7770	This gentleman	848	” said Miss Tox , pointing out the apple - faced man , “
7803	7825	7791	7791	you	848	” The apple - faced man having sheepishly complied with this request , stood chuckling and grinning in a front row . “
7834	7848	7791	7791	you	848	” said Miss Tox , singling out the young woman with the baby . “
7856	7857	7851	7851	you	848	” “
7869	7905	7867	7867	Ma’am	219	” said Polly . By way of bringing her out dexterously , Miss Tox had made the inquiry as in condescension to an old acquaintance whom she had n’t seen for a fortnight or so . “
7913	7918	7906	7906	I	0	” said Miss Tox . “
7952	7953	7950	7950	Jemima	220	” “

8053	8054	8055	8055	I	0	” “

8076	8080	8069	8069	you	0	” he repeated . “
8084	8089	8069	8069	you	0	” said Miss Tox . “
8145	8146	8147	8147	Stoker	222	” “
8149	8154	8155	8156	A choker	865	” said the man . “
8158	8166	8167	8167	Stoker	222	” said Miss Tox , quite aghast . “
8169	8174	8167	8167	Stoker	222	” said the man . “
8178	8179	8175	8176	Steam ingine	223	” “
8186	8210	8175	8176	Steam ingine	223	” returned Miss Tox , looking thoughtfully at him , and seeming still to have but a very imperfect understanding of his meaning . “
8220	8221	8218	8218	Sir	735	” “
8226	8231	8224	8224	Mum	224	” said the man . “
8234	8239	8224	8224	Mum	224	” replied Miss Tox . “
8243	8244	8224	8224	Mum	224	” “
8259	8264	8267	8268	a man	868	” touching his chest : “
8288	8640	8283	8283	Mum	224	” Miss Tox seemed to be so little enlightened by this reply , as to find a difficulty in pursuing the subject . But Mrs Chick relieved her , by entering into a close private examination of Polly , her children , her marriage certificate , testimonials , and so forth . Polly coming out unscathed from this ordeal , Mrs Chick withdrew with her report to her brother ’s room , and as an emphatic comment on it , and corroboration of it , carried the two rosiest little Toodles with her . Toodle being the family name of the apple - faced family . Mr Dombey had remained in his own apartment since the death of his wife , absorbed in visions of the youth , education , and destination of his baby son . Something lay at the bottom of his cool heart , colder and heavier than its ordinary load ; but it was more a sense of the child ’s loss than his own , awakening within him an almost angry sorrow . That the life and progress on which he built such hopes , should be endangered in the outset by so mean a want ; that Dombey and Son should be tottering for a nurse , was a sore humiliation . And yet in his pride and jealousy , he viewed with so much bitterness the thought of being dependent for the very first step towards the accomplishment of his soul ’s desire , on a hired serving - woman who would be to the child , for the time , all that even his alliance could have made his own wife , that in every new rejection of a candidate he felt a secret pleasure . The time had now come , however , when he could no longer be divided between these two sets of feelings . The less so , as there seemed to be no flaw in the title of Polly Toodle after his sister had set it forth , with many commendations on the indefatigable friendship of Miss Tox . “
8646	8651	8283	8283	Mum	224	” said Mr Dombey . “
8670	8671	8653	8654	my God	870	” “
8678	8682	8653	8654	my God	870	” Louisa began — “
8686	8707	8712	8712	you	871	” echoed Mr Dombey , who had not intended his sister to participate in the thought he had unconsciously expressed . “
8717	8718	8712	8712	you	871	” “
8726	8727	8723	8723	I	0	” “
8731	8738	8723	8723	I	0	” said Mr Dombey , sternly . “
8772	8797	8764	8764	me	0	” Mrs Chick bore off the tender pair of Toodles , and presently returned with that tougher couple whose presence her brother had commanded . “
8802	8828	8798	8800	My good woman	875	” said Mr Dombey , turning round in his easy chair , as one piece , and not as a man with limbs and joints , “
8957	8958	8950	8950	You	875	” “
8961	8972	8950	8950	You	875	” said Mr Dombey , after a pretty long pause . “
8984	9026	8975	8976	your husband	882	” As the husband did nothing but chuckle and grin , and continually draw his right hand across his mouth , moistening the palm , Mrs Toodle , after nudging him twice or thrice in vain , dropped a curtsey and replied “
9048	9049	8975	8976	your husband	882	” “
9055	9060	8975	8976	your husband	882	” said Mr Dombey . “
9159	9186	9155	9155	you	227	” Mrs Toodle seemed doubtful about it ; and as to Toodle himself , he had evidently no doubt whatever , that he was all abroad . “
9194	9199	9155	9155	you	227	” said Mr Dombey . “
9294	9313	9314	9314	she	716	” Mrs Toodle , with a little more colour in her cheeks than she had had before , said “
9321	9322	9325	9325	you	227	” “
9330	9335	9325	9325	you	227	” said Mr Dombey . “
9397	9541	9382	9382	Mr	893	” Thus arrested on the threshold as he was following his wife out of the room , Toodle returned and confronted Mr Dombey alone . He was a strong , loose , round - shouldered , shuffling , shaggy fellow , on whom his clothes sat negligently : with a good deal of hair and whisker , deepened in its natural tint , perhaps by smoke and coal - dust : hard knotty hands : and a square forehead , as coarse in grain as the bark of an oak . A thorough contrast in all respects , to Mr Dombey , who was one of those close - shaved close - cut moneyed gentlemen who are glossy and crisp like new bank - notes , and who seem to be artificially braced and tightened as by the stimulating action of golden showerbaths . “
9550	9555	9544	9545	a son	894	” said Mr Dombey . “
9571	9572	9544	9545	a son	894	” “
9587	9592	9593	9593	I	0	” said Mr Dombey . “
9608	9609	9606	9606	Sir	735	” “
9614	9615	9606	9606	Sir	735	” “
9622	9623	9620	9620	Sir	735	” “
9628	9633	9625	9625	you	227	” asked Mr Dombey . “
9641	9642	9639	9639	Sir	735	” “
9645	9646	9639	9639	Sir	735	” “
9652	9653	9639	9639	Sir	735	” “
9657	9658	9659	9659	I	0	” “
9679	9686	9673	9673	I	0	” said Toodle after some reflection . “
9690	9695	9673	9673	I	0	” said Mr Dombey , “
9707	9708	9696	9696	you	0	” “
9716	9723	9714	9714	Sir	735	” answered Toodle , after more reflection “
9731	9736	9714	9714	Sir	735	” asked Mr Dombey . “
9770	9771	9759	9759	he	905	” “
9774	9815	9759	9759	he	905	” said Mr Dombey , after looking at him attentively , and with no great favour , as he stood gazing round the room ( principally round the ceiling ) and still drawing his hand across and across his mouth . “
9827	9828	9819	9819	I	0	” “
9833	9861	9829	9829	Polly	218	” said Toodle , jerking his hat over his shoulder in the direction of the door , with an air of perfect confidence in his better half . “
9867	9868	9829	9829	Polly	218	” “
9888	9893	9894	9894	I	0	” pursued Mr Dombey . “
9898	9902	9894	9894	I	0	” said Toodle , “
9915	9944	9913	9913	Sir	735	“ account of being no scholar , and the words being — ask your pardon — rayther high . But Polly heerd it . It ’s all right . ”
9945	9955	9957	9958	Mr Dombey	190	“ As you appear to leave everything to her , ”
9980	9994	9962	9962	his	190	“ I suppose it is of no use my saying anything to you . ”
9995	10000	10002	10002	Toodle	218	“ Not a bit , ”
10004	10015	10002	10002	Toodle	218	“ Polly heerd it . She ’s awake , Sir . ”
10016	10026	10028	10029	Mr Dombey	190	“ I wo n’t detain you any longer then , ”
10033	10042	10028	10029	Mr Dombey	190	“ Where have you worked all your life ? ”
10043	10049	10002	10002	Toodle	218	“ Mostly underground , Sir , “
10079	10090	10062	10062	I	0	” As he added in one of his hoarse whispers , “
10102	10112	10091	10091	We	913	” Mr Dombey inquired haughtily who little Biler was . “
10120	10128	10118	10118	Sir	735	” said Toodle , with a smile . “
10182	10183	10185	10185	you	735	” “
10192	10204	10185	10185	you	735	” inquired Mr Dombey ; looking at him with marked displeasure , “
10215	10216	10206	10206	you	735	” “
10223	10235	10221	10221	Sir	735	” returned Toodle , with a tender consideration for his mistake . “
10274	10499	10267	10267	Biler	229	” As the last straw breaks the laden camel ’s back , this piece of information crushed the sinking spirits of Mr Dombey . He motioned his child ’s foster - father to the door , who departed by no means unwillingly : and then turning the key , paced up and down the room in solitary wretchedness . It would be harsh , and perhaps not altogether true , to say of him that he felt these rubs and gratings against his pride more keenly than he had felt his wife ’s death : but certainly they impressed that event upon him with new force , and communicated to it added weight and bitterness . It was a rude shock to his sense of property in his child , that these people — the mere dust of the earth , as he thought them — should be necessary to him ; and it was natural that in proportion as he felt disturbed by it , he should deplore the occurrence which had made them so . For all his starched , impenetrable dignity and composure , he wiped blinding tears from his eyes as he paced up and down his room ; and often said , with an emotion of which he would not , for the world , have had a witness , “
10504	10546	10500	10502	Poor little fellow	923	” It may have been characteristic of Mr Dombey ’s pride , that he pitied himself through the child . Not poor me . Not poor widower , confiding by constraint in the wife of an ignorant Hind who has been working “
10549	11029	10267	10267	Biler	229	” all his life , and yet at whose door Death had never knocked , and at whose poor table four sons daily sit — but poor little fellow ! Those words being on his lips , it occurred to him — and it is an instance of the strong attraction with which his hopes and fears and all his thoughts were tending to one centre — that a great temptation was being placed in this woman ’s way . Her infant was a boy too . Now , would it be possible for her to change them ? Though he was soon satisfied that he had dismissed the idea as romantic and unlikely — though possible , there was no denying — he could not help pursuing it so far as to entertain within himself a picture of what his condition would be , if he should discover such an imposture when he was grown old . Whether a man so situated would be able to pluck away the result of so many years of usage , confidence , and belief , from the impostor , and endow a stranger with it ? But it was idle speculating thus . It could n’t happen . In a moment afterwards he determined that it could , but that such women were constantly observed , and had no opportunity given them for the accomplishment of such a design , even when they were so wicked as to entertain it . In another moment , he was remembering how few such cases seemed to have ever happened . In another moment he was wondering whether they ever happened and were not found out . As his unusual emotion subsided , these misgivings gradually melted away , though so much of their shadow remained behind , that he was constant in his resolution to look closely after Richards himself , without appearing to do so . Being now in an easier frame of mind , he regarded the woman ’s station as rather an advantageous circumstance than otherwise , by placing , in itself , a broad distance between her and the child , and rendering their separation easy and natural . Thence he passed to the contemplation of the future glories of Dombey and Son , and dismissed the memory of his wife , for the time being , with a tributary sigh or two . Meanwhile terms were ratified and agreed upon between Mrs Chick and Richards , with the assistance of Miss Tox ; and Richards being with much ceremony invested with the Dombey baby , as if it were an Order , resigned her own , with many tears and kisses , to Jemima . Glasses of wine were then produced , to sustain the drooping spirits of the family ; and Miss Tox , busying herself in dispensing “
11031	11065	11066	11066	You	924	” to the younger branches , bred them up to their father ’s business with such surprising expedition , that she made chokers of four of them in a quarter of a minute . “
11079	11088	11077	11077	you	735	” said Miss Tox , as Toodle appeared . “
11093	11097	11091	11091	Mum	224	” said Toodle , “
11103	11104	11099	11099	you	224	” “
11128	11140	11126	11126	Sir	735	” said Miss Tox , nodding and winking at him stealthily . “
11145	11149	11143	11143	Mum	224	” said Toodle . “
11158	11189	11154	11154	her	926	” Polly cried more than ever at this . So Mrs Chick , who had her matronly apprehensions that this indulgence in grief might be prejudicial to the little Dombey ( “
11194	11206	11154	11154	her	926	” she whispered Miss Tox ) , hastened to the rescue . “
11220	11225	11218	11218	Richards	227	” said Mrs Chick ; “
11268	11269	11270	11270	Ye	227	” “
11276	11280	11270	11270	Ye	227	” sobbed Polly . “
11290	11295	11297	11300	the same young person	931	” said Mrs Chick , “
11314	11315	11316	11316	Lor	233	” “
11324	11329	11318	11318	you	227	” said Miss Tox , “
11343	11344	11348	11348	her	934	” “
11350	11356	11348	11348	her	934	” said Toodle , gruffly , “
11361	11371	11348	11348	her	934	” Toodle was evidently not to be bought over . “
11381	11386	11376	11376	Richards	227	” pursued Mrs Chick , “
11432	11433	11429	11430	a Lady	935	” “
11439	11452	11429	11430	a Lady	935	” said Miss Tox , keeping up the ball with great sympathy . “
11465	11466	11463	11463	Louisa	204	” “
11471	11480	11463	11463	Louisa	204	” returned Mrs Chick in the same tone . “
11497	11498	11486	11486	you	227	” “
11504	11509	11486	11486	you	227	” suggested Miss Tox . “
11514	11518	11519	11519	she	937	” said Louisa , “
11537	11538	11534	11535	my love	789	” “
11548	11553	11556	11556	she	937	” said Miss Tox , “
11583	11584	11572	11572	you	227	” “
11588	11595	11572	11572	you	227	” cried Mrs Chick , benignantly . “
11598	11603	11572	11572	you	227	” resumed Miss Tox , “
11650	11651	11648	11648	Louisa	204	” “
11655	11660	11648	11648	Louisa	204	” said Mrs Chick . “
11710	11711	11705	11705	she	937	” “
11715	11720	11705	11705	she	937	” cried Miss Tox . “
11727	11779	11780	11780	Polly	218	” Notwithstanding which , however , poor Polly embraced them all round in great distress , and coming to her spouse at last , could not make up her mind to part from him , until he gently disengaged himself , at the close of the following allegorical piece of consolation : “
11783	11881	11780	11780	Polly	218	“ ooman , whatever you do , my darling , hold up your head and fight low . That ’s the only rule as I know on , that ’ll carry anyone through life . You always have held up your head and fought low , Polly . Do it now , or Bricks is no longer so . God bless you , Polly ! Me and J’mima will do your duty by you ; and with relating to your’n , hold up your head and fight low , Polly , and you ca n’t go wrong ! ”
12122	12124	12101	12102	a Father	727	“ performed ”
13358	13373	13375	13375	Richards	227	“ It ’s Miss Florence come home from her aunt ’s , no doubt , ”
13385	13393	13375	13375	Richards	227	“ Hope I see you well , Miss. ”
13394	13400	13402	13403	the child	716	“ Is that my brother ? ”
13410	13416	13418	13418	Richards	227	“ Yes , my pretty , ”
13420	13426	13418	13418	Richards	227	“ Come and kiss him . ”
13445	13454	13428	13429	the child	716	“ What have you done with my Mama ? ”
13455	13462	13464	13464	Richards	227	“ Lord bless the little creeter ! ”
13466	13478	13464	13464	Richards	227	“ what a sad question ! I done ? Nothing , Miss. ”
13479	13488	13490	13491	the child	716	“ What have they done with my Mama ? ”
13501	13514	13516	13516	Richards	227	“ I never saw such a melting thing in all my life ! ”
13536	13552	13516	13516	Richards	227	“ Come nearer here , my dear Miss ! Do n’t be afraid of me . ”
13553	13561	13563	13564	the child	716	“ I am not afraid of you , ”
13569	13583	13563	13564	the child	716	“ But I want to know what they have done with my Mama . ”
13638	13642	13644	13644	Richards	227	“ My darling , ”
13646	13659	13644	13644	Richards	227	“ you wear that pretty black frock in remembrance of your Mama . ”

13679	13684	13669	13670	the child	716	“ in any frock . ”
13685	13700	13644	13644	Richards	227	“ But people put on black , to remember people when they ’re gone . ”
13701	13705	13707	13708	the child	716	“ Where gone ? ”
13710	13718	13720	13720	Richards	227	“ Come and sit down by me , ”
13722	13731	13720	13720	Richards	227	“ and I ’ll tell you a story . ”
13781	13787	13789	13789	Richards	227	“ Once upon a time , ”
13791	13810	13789	13789	Richards	227	“ there was a lady — a very good lady , and her little daughter dearly loved her . ”
13811	13824	13826	13827	the child	716	“ A very good lady and her little daughter dearly loved her , ”
13829	13849	13850	13851	The child	716	“ Who , when God thought it right that it should be so , was taken ill and died . ”
13854	13878	13850	13851	The child	716	“ Died , never to be seen again by anyone on earth , and was buried in the ground where the trees grow . ”
13879	13884	13886	13887	the child	716	“ The cold ground ? ”
13892	13899	13886	13887	the child	716	“ No ! The warm ground , ”
13907	13948	13949	13950	The child	716	“ where the ugly little seeds turn into beautiful flowers , and into grass , and corn , and I do n’t know what all besides . Where good people turn into bright angels , and fly away to Heaven ! ”
13969	13976	13978	13978	Polly	218	“ So ; let me see , ”
14010	14044	14046	14046	Polly	218	“ So , when this lady died , wherever they took her , or wherever they put her , she went to GOD ! and she prayed to Him , this lady did , ”
14058	14115	14049	14049	herself	218	“ to teach her little daughter to be sure of that in her heart : and to know that she was happy there and loved her still : and to hope and try — Oh , all her life — to meet her there one day , never , never , never to part any more . ”
14116	14122	14124	14125	the child	716	“ It was my Mama ! ”
14137	14144	14146	14146	Polly	218	“ And the child ’s heart , ”
14154	14234	14236	14236	Polly	218	“ the little daughter ’s heart was so full of the truth of this , that even when she heard it from a strange nurse that could n’t tell it right , but was a poor mother herself and that was all , she found a comfort in it — didn’t feel so lonely — sobbed and cried upon her bosom — took kindly to the baby lying in her lap — and — there , there , there ! ”
14249	14255	14236	14236	Polly	218	“ There , poor dear ! ”
14256	14272	14283	14304	a short , brown , womanly girl of fourteen , with a little snub nose , and black eyes like jet beads	1052	“ Oh well , Miss Floy ! And wo n’t your Pa be angry neither ! ”
14306	14310	14283	14304	a short , brown , womanly girl of fourteen , with a little snub nose , and black eyes like jet beads	1052	“ When it was “
14326	14327	14328	14328	She	1053	” “
14334	14342	14328	14328	She	1053	” was the surprised rejoinder of Polly . “
14350	14351	14328	14328	She	1053	” “
14370	14395	14367	14367	you	218	” returned the black - eyed girl , who was so desperately sharp and biting that she seemed to make one ’s eyes water . “
14421	14422	14413	14413	I	0	” “
14430	14434	14413	14413	I	0	” said Polly . “
14446	14452	14439	14440	Mrs Richards	227	” returned the sharp girl . “
14479	14480	14477	14477	your’n	1056	” “
14488	14492	14496	14497	Mrs Richards	227	” said Polly . “
14499	14503	14496	14497	Mrs Richards	227	” rejoined Spitfire . “
14533	14562	14563	14564	Miss Florence	197	” Spitfire made use of none but comma pauses ; shooting out whatever she had to say in one sentence , and in one breath , if possible . “
14574	14578	14572	14572	she	197	” asked Polly . “
14627	14684	14685	14685	She	197	” With this remonstrance , young Spitfire , whose real name was Susan Nipper , detached the child from her new friend by a wrench — as if she were a tooth . But she seemed to do it , more in the excessively sharp exercise of her official functions , than with any deliberate unkindness . “
14698	14714	14692	14692	she	197	” said Polly , nodding to her with an encouraging smile upon her wholesome face , “
14727	14728	14729	14729	Lork	243	” “
14734	14747	14729	14729	Lork	243	” cried Miss Nipper , taking up her words with a jerk . “
14766	14767	14762	14762	her	197	” “
14773	14777	14778	14778	Lork	243	” asked Polly . “
14830	14852	14823	14824	Mrs Richards	227	” The child looked quickly from one nurse to the other , as if she understood and felt what was said . “
14857	14861	14823	14824	Mrs Richards	227	” cried Polly . “
14870	14871	14864	14865	Mr Dombey	190	” “
14874	14879	14885	14885	he	190	” interrupted Susan Nipper . “
14952	14960	14945	14946	Mrs Richards	227	” said Spitfire , with a giggle , “
14971	14972	14964	14964	he	190	” “
14976	14991	14964	14964	he	190	” said Richards ; meaning , not Miss Nipper , but the little Florence . “
15024	15029	15035	15036	Mrs Richards	227	” said Susan Nipper ; “
15069	15113	15035	15036	Mrs Richards	227	” In spite of being thus adjured , and in spite also of some hauling on the part of Susan Nipper , tending towards the dislocation of her right shoulder , little Florence broke away , and kissed her new friend , affectionately . “
15123	15137	15139	15139	Susan	241	“ tickerlerly , that Mrs Richards was n’t to be made free with ! ”
15141	15148	15139	15139	Susan	241	“ Very well , Miss Floy ! ”
15149	15156	15158	15158	Richards	227	“ God bless the sweet thing ! ”
15160	15167	15158	15158	Richards	227	“ Good - bye , dear ! ”
15168	15173	15175	15176	the child	716	“ Good - bye ! ”
15178	15211	15175	15176	the child	716	“ God bless you ! I shall come to see you again soon , and you ’ll come to see me ? Susan will let us . Wo n’t you , Susan ? ”
15300	15369	15370	15370	Richards	227	“ It ai n’t right of you to ask it , Miss Floy , for you know I ca n’t refuse you , but Mrs Richards and me will see what can be done , if Mrs Richards likes , I may wish , you see , to take a voyage to Chaney , Mrs Richards , but I may n’t know how to leave the London Docks . ”
15376	15389	15391	15392	Miss Nipper	241	“ This house ai n’t so exactly ringing with merry - making , ”
15394	15436	15391	15392	Miss Nipper	241	“ that one need be lonelier than one must be . Your Toxes and your Chickses may draw out my two front double teeth , Mrs Richards , but that ’s no reason why I need offer ’em the whole set . ”
15451	15461	15463	15464	Susan Nipper	241	“ So I ’m agreeable , I ’m sure , ”
15466	15520	15463	15464	Susan Nipper	241	“ to live friendly , Mrs Richards , while Master Paul continues a permanency , if the means can be planned out without going openly against orders , but goodness gracious Miss Floy , you have n’t got your things off yet , you naughty child , you have n’t , come along ! ”
15974	15980	15990	15990	he	190	“ Good evening , Richards . ”
16021	16029	16008	16008	she	218	“ How is Master Paul , Richards ? ”
16030	16039	15990	15990	he	190	“ Quite thriving , Sir , and well . ”
16040	16045	16047	16048	Mr Dombey	190	“ He looks so , ”
16074	16085	15990	15990	he	190	“ They give you everything you want , I hope ? ”
16086	16095	16096	16096	She	218	“ Oh yes , thank you , Sir . ”
16127	16146	16148	16148	Richards	227	“ If you please , Sir , the child is very much disposed to take notice of things , ”
16154	16169	16148	16148	Richards	227	“ and — upstairs is a little dull for him , perhaps , Sir . ”
16170	16183	16185	16186	Mr Dombey	190	“ I begged them to take you out for airings , constantly , ”
16188	16206	16185	16186	Mr Dombey	190	“ Very well ! You shall go out oftener . You ’re quite right to mention it . ”
16207	16215	16217	16217	Polly	218	“ I beg your pardon , Sir , ”
16219	16231	16217	16217	Polly	218	“ but we go out quite plenty Sir , thank you . ”
16232	16239	16241	16242	Mr Dombey	190	“ What would you have then ? ”
16244	16254	16256	16256	Polly	218	“ Indeed Sir , I do n’t exactly know , ”
16258	16261	16256	16256	Polly	218	“ unless — ”
16262	16265	16217	16217	Polly	218	“ Yes ? ”
16266	16290	16292	16292	Polly	218	“ I believe nothing is so good for making children lively and cheerful , Sir , as seeing other children playing about ’em , ”
16297	16312	16314	16315	Mr Dombey	190	“ I think I mentioned to you , Richards , when you came here , ”
16321	16336	16314	16315	Mr Dombey	190	“ that I wished you to see as little of your family as possible . ”
16337	16354	16292	16292	Polly	218	“ Oh dear yes , Sir , I was n’t so much as thinking of that . ”
16355	16362	16364	16365	Mr Dombey	190	“ I am glad of it , ”
16368	16378	16364	16365	Mr Dombey	190	“ You can continue your walk if you please . ”
16484	16499	16500	16500	he	190	“ If you really think that sort of society is good for the child , ”
16516	16522	16500	16500	he	190	“ where ’s Miss Florence ? ”
16523	16534	16536	16536	Polly	218	“ Nothing could be better than Miss Florence , Sir , ”
16539	16552	16536	16536	Polly	218	“ but I understood from her maid that they were not to — ”
16566	16605	16553	16554	Mr Dombey	190	“ Tell them always to let Miss Florence be with Richards when she chooses , and go out with her , and so forth . Tell them to let the children be together , when Richards wishes it . ”
17170	17185	17133	17133	he	190	“ Oh father , try to love me ! there ’s no one else ! ”
17265	17269	17270	17270	he	190	“ Come in , ”
17273	17284	17270	17270	he	190	“ come in : what is the child afraid of ? ”
17315	17321	17323	17324	her father	1111	“ Come here , Florence , ”
17328	17336	17323	17324	her father	1111	“ Do you know who I am ? ”
17337	17342	17361	17361	she	197	“ Yes , Papa . ”
17343	17352	17358	17358	her	197	“ Have you nothing to say to me ? ”
17424	17432	17433	17433	he	190	“ There ! Be a good girl , ”
17457	17464	17433	17433	he	190	“ Go to Richards ! Go ! ”
17686	17692	17694	17694	Polly	218	“ It ’s hard indeed , ”
17696	17721	17694	17694	Polly	218	“ if he takes only to one little motherless child , when he has another , and that a girl , before his eyes . ”
17824	17842	17801	17801	she	218	“ Oh no , no ! He do n’t want me . He do n’t want me ! ”
17877	17897	17899	17899	Richards	227	“ Miss Florence was afraid of interrupting , Sir , if she came in to say good - night , ”
17901	17907	17899	17899	Richards	227	“ It does n’t matter , ”
17912	17924	17909	17910	Mr Dombey	190	“ You can let her come and go without regarding me . ”
18027	18036	18038	18038	Polly	218	“ I thought you would have been pleased , ”
18040	18056	18058	18058	Susan	241	“ Oh yes , Mrs Richards , I ’m very well pleased , thank you , ”
18080	18087	18089	18089	Polly	218	“ You do n’t show it , ”
18091	18110	18112	18113	Susan Nipper	241	“ Oh ! Being only a permanency I could n’t be expected to show it like a temporary , ”
18115	18158	18112	18113	Susan Nipper	241	“ Temporaries carries it all before ’em here , I find , but though there ’s a excellent party - wall between this house and the next , I may n’t exactly like to go to it , Mrs Richards , notwithstanding ! ”
18265	18271	18275	18277	their magnificent neighbour	1135	“ down among the dead men ”

19435	19439	19431	19432	Mr Gills	248	“ very much . ”
19472	19480	19482	19483	Solomon Gills	248	“ Where ’s Walter , I wonder ! ”
19495	19510	19482	19483	Solomon Gills	248	“ Here ’s dinner been ready , half an hour , and no Walter ! ”
19589	19626	19628	19629	Mr Gills	248	“ If I did n’t know he was too fond of me to make a run of it , and go and enter himself aboard ship against my wishes , I should begin to be fidgetty , ”
19642	19664	19628	19629	Mr Gills	248	“ I really should . All in the Downs , eh ! Lots of moisture ! Well ! it ’s wanted . ”
19665	19669	19671	19672	Mr Gills	248	“ I believe , ”
19687	19732	19671	19672	Mr Gills	248	“ that you do n’t point more direct and due to the back parlour than the boy ’s inclination does after all . And the parlour could n’t bear straighter either . Due north . Not the twentieth part of a point either way . ”
19733	19739	19628	19629	Mr Gills	248	“ Halloa , Uncle Sol ! ”
19740	19746	19748	19751	the Instrument - maker	1191	“ Halloa , my boy ! ”
19757	19767	19748	19751	the Instrument - maker	1191	“ What ! you are here , are you ? ”
19796	19820	19628	19629	Mr Gills	248	“ Well , Uncle , how have you got on without me all day ? Is dinner ready ? I ’m so hungry . ”
19821	19827	19829	19829	Solomon	250	“ As to getting on , ”
19834	19885	19829	19829	Solomon	250	“ it would be odd if I could n’t get on without a young dog like you a great deal better than with you . As to dinner being ready , it ’s been ready this half hour and waiting for you . As to being hungry , I am ! ”
19886	19893	19895	19896	the boy	10021	“ Come along then , Uncle ! ”
19898	19904	19895	19896	the boy	10021	“ Hurrah for the admiral ! ”
19905	19910	19912	19913	Solomon Gills	248	“ Confound the admiral ! ”
19915	19922	19895	19896	the boy	10021	“ You mean the Lord Mayor . ”
19923	19929	19931	19932	the boy	10021	“ No I do n’t ! ”
19934	19949	19931	19932	the boy	10021	“ Hurrah for the admiral ! Hurrah for the admiral ! For - ward ! ”
20005	20012	20014	20014	Solomon	250	“ The Lord Mayor , Wally , ”
20016	20031	20014	20014	Solomon	250	“ for ever ! No more admirals . The Lord Mayor ’s your admiral . ”
20032	20039	20041	20042	the boy	10021	“ Oh , is he though ! ”
20048	20065	20041	20042	the boy	10021	“ Why , the Sword Bearer ’s better than him . He draws his sword sometimes . ”
20066	20079	20081	20082	the Uncle	1201	“ And a pretty figure he cuts with it for his pains , ”
20084	20100	20081	20082	the Uncle	1201	“ Listen to me , Wally , listen to me . Look on the mantelshelf . ”
20101	20116	20118	20119	the boy	10021	“ Why who has cocked my silver mug up there , on a nail ? ”
20121	20125	20127	20128	his Uncle	1203	“ I have , ”
20130	20167	20127	20128	his Uncle	1203	“ No more mugs now . We must begin to drink out of glasses today , Walter . We are men of business . We belong to the City . We started in life this morning . ”
20168	20173	20175	20176	the boy	10021	“ Well , Uncle , ”
20178	20210	20175	20176	the boy	10021	“ I ’ll drink out of anything you like , so long as I can drink to you . Here ’s to you , Uncle Sol , and Hurrah for the — ”

20221	20235	20237	20238	the boy	10021	“ For the Lord Mayor , Sheriffs , Common Council , and Livery , ”

20264	20273	20261	20261	he	1201	“ let ’s hear something about the Firm . ”
20274	20290	20292	20293	the boy	10021	“ Oh ! there ’s not much to be told about the Firm , Uncle , ”
20301	20399	20292	20293	the boy	10021	“ It ’s a precious dark set of offices , and in the room where I sit , there ’s a high fender , and an iron safe , and some cards about ships that are going to sail , and an almanack , and some desks and stools , and an inkbottle , and some books , and some boxes , and a lot of cobwebs , and in one of ’em , just over my head , a shrivelled - up blue - bottle that looks as if it had hung there ever so long . ”
20400	20404	20406	20407	the Uncle	1201	“ Nothing else ? ”
20409	20435	20406	20407	the Uncle	1201	“ No , nothing else , except an old birdcage ( I wonder how that ever came there ! ) and a coal - scuttle . ”
20436	20461	20463	20464	old Sol	250	“ No bankers ’ books , or cheque books , or bills , or such tokens of wealth rolling in from day to day ? ”
20492	20502	20504	20505	his nephew	1170	“ Oh yes , plenty of that I suppose , ”
20508	20532	20504	20505	his nephew	1170	“ but all that sort of thing ’s in Mr Carker ’s room , or Mr Morfin ’s , or Mr Dombey ’s . ”
20533	20541	20543	20544	the Uncle	1201	“ Has Mr Dombey been there today ? ”
20546	20556	20543	20544	the Uncle	1201	“ Oh yes ! In and out all day . ”
20557	20570	20504	20505	his nephew	1170	“ He did n’t take any notice of you , I suppose ? ”
20572	20645	20504	20505	his nephew	1170	“ Yes he did . He walked up to my seat,—I wish he was n’t so solemn and stiff , Uncle,—and said , ‘ Oh ! you are the son of Mr Gills the Ships ’ Instrument - maker . ’ ‘ Nephew , Sir , ’ I said . ‘ I said nephew , boy , ’ said he . But I could take my oath he said son , Uncle . ”
20646	20658	20504	20505	his nephew	1170	“ You ’re mistaken I daresay . It ’s no matter . ”
20659	20744	20504	20505	his nephew	1170	“ No , it ’s no matter , but he need n’t have been so sharp , I thought . There was no harm in it though he did say son . Then he told me that you had spoken to him about me , and that he had found me employment in the House accordingly , and that I was expected to be attentive and punctual , and then he went away . I thought he did n’t seem to like me much . ”
20745	20752	20754	20757	the Instrument - maker	1191	“ You mean , I suppose , ”
20759	20770	20754	20757	the Instrument - maker	1191	“ that you did n’t seem to like him much ? ”
20771	20776	20778	20779	the boy	10021	“ Well , Uncle , ”
20783	20793	20794	20794	Solomon	248	“ Perhaps so ; I never thought of that . ”
20898	20904	20906	20907	the boy	10021	“ Why , Uncle Sol ! ”
20909	20926	20906	20907	the boy	10021	“ what are you about ? that ’s the wonderful Madeira!—there ’s only one more bottle ! ”
20969	20979	20980	20980	he	250	“ You shall drink the other bottle , Wally , ”
20983	21041	20980	20980	he	250	“ when you come to good fortune ; when you are a thriving , respected , happy man ; when the start in life you have made today shall have brought you , as I pray Heaven it may!—to a smooth part of the course you have to run , my child . My love to you ! ”
21102	21106	21108	21109	the boy	10021	“ Dear Uncle , ”
21126	21181	21182	21182	They	1223	“ for the honour you have done me , et cetera , et cetera . I shall now beg to propose Mr Solomon Gills with three times three and one cheer more . Hurrah ! and you ’ll return thanks , Uncle , when we drink the last bottle together ; wo n’t you ? ”
21267	21273	21274	21274	he	293	“ You see , Walter , ”
21277	21321	21274	21274	he	293	“ in truth this business is merely a habit with me . I am so accustomed to the habit that I could hardly live if I relinquished it : but there ’s nothing doing , nothing doing . When that uniform was worn , ”
21329	21380	21274	21274	he	293	“ then indeed , fortunes were to be made , and were made . But competition , competition — new invention , new invention — alteration , alteration — the world ’s gone past me . I hardly know where I am myself , much less where my customers are . ”
21381	21388	21274	21274	he	293	“ Never mind ’em , Uncle ! ”
21389	21411	21413	21413	Solomon	248	“ Since you came home from weekly boarding - school at Peckham , for instance — and that ’s ten days , ”
21415	21431	21413	21413	Solomon	248	“ I do n’t remember more than one person that has come into the shop . ”
21432	21456	21274	21274	he	293	“ Two , Uncle , do n’t you recollect ? There was the man who came to ask for change for a sovereign — ”
21457	21463	21465	21465	Solomon	248	“ That ’s the one , ”
21467	21491	21465	21465	Solomon	248	“ Why Uncle ! do n’t you call the woman anybody , who came to ask the way to Mile - End Turnpike ? ”
21492	21499	21501	21501	Solomon	248	“ Oh ! it ’s true , ”
21503	21511	21501	21501	Solomon	248	“ I forgot her . Two persons . ”
21512	21523	21525	21526	the boy	10021	“ To be sure , they did n’t buy anything , ”
21528	21537	21539	21539	Solomon	248	“ No . They did n’t buy anything , ”
21543	21548	21550	21551	the boy	10021	“ Nor want anything , ”
21553	21567	21569	21569	Solomon	248	“ No . If they had , they ’d gone to another shop , ”
21576	21586	21588	21589	the boy	10021	“ But there were two of ’em , Uncle , ”
21599	21605	21588	21589	the boy	10021	“ You said only one . ”
21606	21611	21613	21615	the old man	1205	“ Well , Wally , ”
21622	21787	21613	21615	the old man	1205	“ not being like the Savages who came on Robinson Crusoe ’s Island , we ca n’t live on a man who asks for change for a sovereign , and a woman who inquires the way to Mile - End Turnpike . As I said just now , the world has gone past me . I do n’t blame it ; but I no longer understand it . Tradesmen are not the same as they used to be , apprentices are not the same , business is not the same , business commodities are not the same . Seven - eighths of my stock is old - fashioned . I am an old - fashioned man in an old - fashioned shop , in a street that is not the same as I remember it . I have fallen behind the time , and am too old to catch it again . Even the noise it makes a long way ahead , confuses me . ”
21802	21968	21799	21799	his	1203	“ Therefore , Wally — therefore it is that I am anxious you should be early in the busy world , and on the world ’s track . I am only the ghost of this business — its substance vanished long ago ; and when I die , its ghost will be laid . As it is clearly no inheritance for you then , I have thought it best to use for your advantage , almost the only fragment of the old connexion that stands by me , through long habit . Some people suppose me to be wealthy . I wish for your sake they were right . But whatever I leave behind me , or whatever I can give you , you in such a House as Dombey ’s are in the road to use well and make the most of . Be diligent , try to like it , my dear boy , work for a steady independence , and be happy ! ”
21969	21988	21990	21991	the boy	10021	“ I ’ll do everything I can , Uncle , to deserve your affection . Indeed I will , ”
21995	22000	22002	22002	Solomon	248	“ I know it , ”
22004	22011	22013	22013	he	248	“ I am sure of it , ”
22029	22035	22036	22036	he	248	“ As to the Sea , ”
22039	22094	22036	22036	he	248	“ that ’s well enough in fiction , Wally , but it wo n’t do in fact : it wo n’t do at all . It ’s natural enough that you should think about it , associating it with all these familiar things ; but it wo n’t do , it wo n’t do . ”
22128	22136	22138	22139	old Sol	248	“ Think of this wine for instance , ”
22141	22185	22138	22139	old Sol	248	“ which has been to the East Indies and back , I ’m not able to say how often , and has been once round the world . Think of the pitch - dark nights , the roaring winds , and rolling seas : ”
22186	22201	22203	22204	the boy	10021	“ The thunder , lightning , rain , hail , storm of all kinds , ”
22206	22211	22203	22204	the boy	10021	“ To be sure , ”
22213	22244	22138	22139	old Sol	248	Solomon,—“that this wine has passed through . Think what a straining and creaking of timbers and masts : what a whistling and howling of the gale through ropes and rigging : ”
22245	22281	22283	22284	his nephew	1170	“ What a clambering aloft of men , vying with each other who shall lie out first upon the yards to furl the icy sails , while the ship rolls and pitches , like mad ! ”
22286	22290	22292	22292	Solomon	248	“ Exactly so , ”
22294	22319	22292	22292	Solomon	248	“ has gone on , over the old cask that held this wine . Why , when the Charming Sally went down in the — ”
22320	22370	22372	22372	Walter	293	“ In the Baltic Sea , in the dead of night ; five - and - twenty minutes past twelve when the captain ’s watch stopped in his pocket ; he lying dead against the main - mast — on the fourteenth of February , seventeen forty - nine ! ”
22378	22385	22387	22388	old Sol	248	“ Ay , to be sure ! ”
22390	22466	22387	22388	old Sol	248	“ quite right ! Then , there were five hundred casks of such wine aboard ; and all hands ( except the first mate , first lieutenant , two seamen , and a lady , in a leaky boat ) going to work to stave the casks , got drunk and died drunk , singing ‘ Rule Britannia ’ , when she settled and went down , and ending with one awful scream in chorus . ”
22467	22501	22292	22292	Solomon	248	“ But when the George the Second drove ashore , Uncle , on the coast of Cornwall , in a dismal gale , two hours before daybreak , on the fourth of March , “
22594	22595	22625	22626	John Brown	260	” “
22599	22604	22625	22626	John Brown	260	” said old Sol , “
22609	22610	22606	22607	the Polyphemus	258	” “
22636	22640	22630	22630	Owners	1241	” cried Walter . “
22644	22648	22630	22630	Owners	1241	” said Sol ; “
22671	22672	22630	22630	Owners	1241	” “
22680	22691	22675	22678	two brothers on board	1242	” interposed his nephew , speaking very fast and loud , “
22786	22862	22781	22781	himself	0	” The kindling eye and heightened colour of the boy , who had risen from his seat in the earnestness of what he said and felt , seemed to remind old Sol of something he had forgotten , or that his encircling mist had hitherto shut out . Instead of proceeding with any more anecdotes , as he had evidently intended but a moment before , he gave a short dry cough , and said , “
22871	23260	22781	22781	himself	0	” The truth was , that the simple - minded Uncle in his secret attraction towards the marvellous and adventurous — of which he was , in some sort , a distant relation , by his trade — had greatly encouraged the same attraction in the nephew ; and that everything that had ever been put before the boy to deter him from a life of adventure , had had the usual unaccountable effect of sharpening his taste for it . This is invariable . It would seem as if there never was a book written , or a story told , expressly with the object of keeping boys on shore , which did not lure and charm them to the ocean , as a matter of course . But an addition to the little party now made its appearance , in the shape of a gentleman in a wide suit of blue , with a hook instead of a hand attached to his right wrist ; very bushy black eyebrows ; and a thick stick in his left hand , covered all over ( like his nose ) with knobs . He wore a loose black silk handkerchief round his neck , and such a very large coarse shirt collar , that it looked like a small sail . He was evidently the person for whom the spare wine - glass was intended , and evidently knew it ; for having taken off his rough outer coat , and hung up , on a particular peg behind the door , such a hard glazed hat as a sympathetic person ’s head might ache at the sight of , and which left a red rim round his own forehead as if he had been wearing a tight basin , he brought a chair to where the clean glass was , and sat himself down behind it . He was usually addressed as Captain , this visitor ; and had been a pilot , or a skipper , or a privateersman , or all three perhaps ; and was a very salt - looking man indeed . His face , remarkable for a brown solidity , brightened as he shook hands with Uncle and nephew ; but he seemed to be of a laconic disposition , and merely said : “
23265	23266	22781	22781	himself	0	” “
23270	23298	22781	22781	himself	0	” said Mr Gills , pushing the bottle towards him . He took it up , and having surveyed and smelt it , said with extraordinary expression : “
23301	23302	22781	22781	himself	0	” “
23305	23332	22781	22781	himself	0	” returned the Instrument - maker . Upon that he whistled as he filled his glass , and seemed to think they were making holiday indeed . “
23333	23335	23336	23336	he	1256	Wal”r ! ”
23361	23395	23336	23336	he	1256	“ Look at him ! Love ! Honour ! And Obey ! Overhaul your catechism till you find that passage , and when found turn the leaf down . Success , my boy ! ”
23435	23462	23463	23463	he	1256	“ But I never wanted two or three words in my life that I did n’t know where to lay my hand upon ’em , Gills , ”
23466	23477	23463	23463	he	1256	“ It comes of not wasting language as some do . ”
23539	23551	23525	23525	he	248	“ I suppose he could make a clock if he tried ? ”
23552	23561	23563	23564	the boy	10021	“ I should n’t wonder , Captain Cuttle , ”
23566	23572	23574	23575	Captain Cuttle	250	“ And it would go ! ”
23589	23598	23574	23575	Captain Cuttle	250	“ Lord , how that clock would go ! ”
23631	23641	23642	23642	he	250	“ But he ’s chock - full of science , ”
23656	23728	23642	23642	he	250	“ Look’ye here ! Here ’s a collection of ’em . Earth , air , or water . It ’s all one . Only say where you ’ll have it . Up in a balloon ? There you are . Down in a bell ? There you are . D’ye want to put the North Star in a pair of scales and weigh it ? He ’ll do it for you . ”
23766	23769	23770	23770	he	250	“ Ah ! ”
23777	23840	23770	23770	he	250	“ it ’s a fine thing to understand ’em . And yet it ’s a fine thing not to understand ’em . I hardly know which is best . It ’s so comfortable to sit here and feel that you might be weighed , measured , magnified , electrified , polarized , played the very devil with : and never know how . ”
23933	23936	23938	23942	the subject of this admiration	1266	“ Come ! ”
23946	23963	23938	23942	the subject of this admiration	1266	“ Before you have your glass of grog , Ned , we must finish the bottle . ”
23964	23968	23970	23970	Ned	263	“ Stand by ! ”
23976	23983	23970	23970	Ned	263	“ Give the boy some more . ”
23984	23992	23938	23942	the subject of this admiration	1266	“ No more , thank’e , Uncle ! ”
23993	23998	24000	24000	Sol	250	“ Yes , yes , ”
24002	24049	24000	24000	Sol	250	“ a little more . We ’ll finish the bottle , to the House , Ned — Walter ’s House . Why it may be his House one of these days , in part . Who knows ? Sir Richard Whittington married his master ’s daughter . ”
24050	24074	24076	24077	the Captain	10100	“ ‘ Turn again Whittington , Lord Mayor of London , and when you are old you will never depart from it , ’ ”
24079	24080	24076	24077	the Captain	10100	“ Wal”r
24089	24090	24076	24077	the Captain	10100	” “
24100	24104	24109	24109	he	190	” Sol began . “
24114	24123	24125	24125	he	190	” said the boy , reddening and laughing . “
24127	24133	24125	24125	he	190	” cried the old man . “
24141	24142	24135	24135	I	0	” “
24150	24155	24145	24145	I	0	” said the boy . “
24178	24183	24169	24169	they	1271	” lowering his voice , “
24313	24314	24308	24308	I	0	” “
24325	24332	24315	24315	He	190	” said the instrument - maker . “
24337	24351	24335	24335	Uncle	10023	” cried the boy , still reddening and laughing , boy - like . “
24362	24363	24358	24358	they	1282	” “
24381	24391	24379	24379	Ned	263	” said the old man , humouring the joke . “
24395	24400	24379	24379	Ned	263	” said the Captain . “
24408	24412	24403	24403	we	1286	” pursued Sol . “
24422	24423	24418	24418	Dombey	190	” “
24431	24438	24429	24429	Uncle	10023	” said the boy , merrily . “
24485	24599	24477	24477	Dombey	190	” CHAPTER V. Paul ’s Progress and Christening Little Paul , suffering no contamination from the blood of the Toodles , grew stouter and stronger every day . Every day , too , he was more and more ardently cherished by Miss Tox , whose devotion was so far appreciated by Mr Dombey that he began to regard her as a woman of great natural good sense , whose feelings did her credit and deserved encouragement . He was so lavish of this condescension , that he not only bowed to her , in a particular manner , on several occasions , but even entrusted such stately recognitions of her to his sister as “
24613	24615	24608	24608	she	1293	” or “
24630	24986	24618	24619	Miss Tox	208	” specialities which made a deep impression on the lady thus distinguished . Whether Miss Tox conceived that having been selected by the Fates to welcome the little Dombey before he was born , in Kirby , Beard and Kirby ’s Best Mixed Pins , it therefore naturally devolved upon her to greet him with all other forms of welcome in all other early stages of his existence — or whether her overflowing goodness induced her to volunteer into the domestic militia as a substitute in some sort for his deceased Mama — or whether she was conscious of any other motives — are questions which in this stage of the Firm ’s history herself only could have solved . Nor have they much bearing on the fact ( of which there is no doubt ) , that Miss Tox ’s constancy and zeal were a heavy discouragement to Richards , who lost flesh hourly under her patronage , and was in some danger of being superintended to death . Miss Tox was often in the habit of assuring Mrs Chick , that nothing could exceed her interest in all connected with the development of that sweet child ; and an observer of Miss Tox ’s proceedings might have inferred so much without declaratory confirmation . She would preside over the innocent repasts of the young heir , with ineffable satisfaction , almost with an air of joint proprietorship with Richards in the entertainment . At the little ceremonies of the bath and toilette , she assisted with enthusiasm . The administration of infantine doses of physic awakened all the active sympathy of her character ; and being on one occasion secreted in a cupboard ( whither she had fled in modesty ) , when Mr Dombey was introduced into the nursery by his sister , to behold his son , in the course of preparation for bed , taking a short walk uphill over Richards ’s gown , in a short and airy linen jacket , Miss Tox was so transported beyond the ignorant present as to be unable to refrain from crying out , “
25002	25016	25017	25017	Louisa	204	” and then almost sinking behind the closet door with confusion and blushes . “
25019	25031	25017	25017	Louisa	204	” said Mr Dombey , one day , to his sister , “
25104	25184	25185	25185	My	0	” Let it be no detraction from the merits of Miss Tox , to hint that in Mr Dombey ’s eyes , as in some others that occasionally see the light , they only achieved that mighty piece of knowledge , the understanding of their own position , who showed a fitting reverence for his . It was not so much their merit that they knew themselves , as that they knew him , and bowed low before him . “
25189	25194	25195	25195	you	192	” returned his sister , “
25247	25248	25243	25243	Dombey	190	” “

25284	25289	25263	25264	Miss Tox	208	” pursued his sister , “

25356	25361	25323	25323	Paul	192	” asked Mr Dombey . “

25397	25404	25410	25410	Paul	192	” said Mr Dombey , coldly . “
25412	25432	25436	25436	yourself	192	” retorted Mrs Chick , with an extraordinary show of animation , to cover the suddenness of her conversion ; “
25461	25476	25456	25456	your	192	” here Mrs Chick faltered again , as not quite comfortably feeling her way ; “
25532	25533	25534	25534	Louisa	204	” “
25536	25546	25534	25534	Louisa	204	” said Mr Dombey , after a short pause , “
25554	25555	25593	25593	Paul	192	” “
25559	25570	25593	25593	Paul	192	” cried Mrs Chick , hastening to anticipate a refusal , “
25577	25585	25593	25593	Paul	192	” Mr Dombey looked at her impatiently . “
25595	25600	25593	25593	Paul	192	” said his sister ; “
25625	25645	25612	25612	I	0	” Mr Dombey glanced at the pocket - handkerchief which his sister applied to her eyes , and resumed : “
25655	25656	25652	25652	I	0	” “
25661	25666	25658	25658	I	0	” murmured Mrs Chick , “

25681	25686	25679	25679	Louisa	204	” said Mr Dombey . “
25693	25700	25691	25691	Paul	192	” she remonstrated with tearful dignity , “
25790	25809	25810	25810	I	0	” added Mrs Chick with increased dignity , as if she had withheld her crushing argument until now , “
25817	25828	25810	25810	I	0	” Mr Dombey walked to the window and back again . “
25838	25854	25836	25836	Louisa	204	” he said ( Mrs Chick had nailed her colours to the mast , and repeated “
25861	25871	25855	25855	I	0	” but he took no notice of it ) , “
26136	26546	26558	26558	he	1327	” In the course of these remarks , delivered with great majesty and grandeur , Mr Dombey had truly revealed the secret feelings of his breast . An indescribable distrust of anybody stepping in between himself and his son ; a haughty dread of having any rival or partner in the boy ’s respect and deference ; a sharp misgiving , recently acquired , that he was not infallible in his power of bending and binding human wills ; as sharp a jealousy of any second check or cross ; these were , at that time the master keys of his soul . In all his life , he had never made a friend . His cold and distant nature had neither sought one , nor found one . And now , when that nature concentrated its whole force so strongly on a partial scheme of parental interest and ambition , it seemed as if its icy current , instead of being released by this influence , and running clear and free , had thawed for but an instant to admit its burden , and then frozen with it into one unyielding block . Elevated thus to the godmothership of little Paul , in virtue of her insignificance , Miss Tox was from that hour chosen and appointed to office ; and Mr Dombey further signified his pleasure that the ceremony , already long delayed , should take place without further postponement . His sister , who had been far from anticipating so signal a success , withdrew as soon as she could , to communicate it to her best of friends ; and Mr Dombey was left alone in his library . He had already laid his hand upon the bellrope to convey his usual summons to Richards , when his eye fell upon a writing - desk , belonging to his deceased wife , which had been taken , among other things , from a cabinet in her chamber . It was not the first time that his eye had lighted on it He carried the key in his pocket ; and he brought it to his table and opened it now — having previously locked the room door — with a well - accustomed hand . From beneath a leaf of torn and cancelled scraps of paper , he took one letter that remained entire . Involuntarily holding his breath as he opened this document , and “
26952	26958	26960	26961	Miss Tox	208	“ How sound she sleeps ! ”
26963	26986	26960	26961	Miss Tox	208	“ Why , you know , my dear , she takes a great deal of exercise in the course of the day , ”
26991	26999	26960	26961	Miss Tox	208	“ playing about little Paul so much . ”
27000	27007	27009	27010	Miss Tox	208	“ She is a curious child , ”
27012	27016	27018	27019	Mrs Chick	208	“ My dear , ”
27026	27033	27018	27019	Mrs Chick	208	“ Her Mama , all over ! ”

27078	27090	27092	27093	Mrs Chick	208	“ Florence will never , never , never be a Dombey , ”
27095	27107	27092	27093	Mrs Chick	208	“ not if she lives to be a thousand years old . ”
27121	27131	27133	27134	Mrs Chick	208	“ I quite fret and worry myself about her , ”
27143	27195	27133	27134	Mrs Chick	208	“ I really do n’t see what is to become of her when she grows older , or what position she is to take . She do n’t gain on her Papa in the least . How can one expect she should , when she is so very unlike a Dombey ? ”
27217	27225	27227	27228	Mrs Chick	208	“ And the child , you see , ”
27234	27275	27227	27228	Mrs Chick	208	“ has poor dear Fanny ’s nature . She ’ll never make an effort in after - life , I ’ll venture to say . Never ! She ’ll never wind and twine herself about her Papa ’s heart like — ”
27276	27281	27283	27284	Miss Tox	208	“ Like the ivy ? ”
27286	27291	27292	27293	Mrs Chick	208	“ Like the ivy , ”

27327	27333	27335	27336	Mrs Chick	208	“ Like the startled fawn , ”
27338	27351	27335	27336	Mrs Chick	208	“ Never ! Poor Fanny ! Yet , how I loved her ! ”
27352	27362	27364	27365	Miss Tox	208	“ You must not distress yourself , my dear , ”
27372	27382	27364	27365	Miss Tox	208	“ Now really ! You have too much feeling . ”
27383	27390	27392	27393	Mrs Chick	208	“ We have all our faults , ”
27401	27430	27392	27393	Mrs Chick	208	“ I daresay we have . I never was blind to hers . I never said I was . Far from it . Yet how I loved her ! ”

28290	28348	28287	28288	Miss Tox	208	“ that the lady ’s uncle is a magistrate , and that if he gives her any of his impertinence he will be punished terribly . You can pretend to say that , if you please , Towlinson , in a friendly way , and because you know it was done to another man , who died . ”

28358	28374	28376	28377	Miss Tox	208	“ And now good - night to my sweet , sweet , sweet , godson , ”

28537	28542	28544	28545	Susan Nipper	241	“ Oh you beauties ! ”

A person may tell a person to dive off a bridge head foremost into five - and - forty feet of water , Mrs Richards , but a person may be very far from diving . ”
28812	28816	28818	28818	Polly	218	“ There now , ”

32377	32381	32383	32384	Mrs Chick	208	“ My dear , ”

32426	32461	32423	32424	Miss Tox	208	“ I think not . It was more rounded and flowing . Obliging disposition of relations and friends in private , or onerous nature of position in public — may — impose upon him ! ”

32579	32637	32537	32538	Mr Dombey	190	“ During the six months or so , Richards , which have seen you an inmate of this house , you have done your duty . Desiring to connect some little service to you with this occasion , I considered how I could best effect that object , and I also advised with my sister , Mrs — ”
32638	32641	32643	32647	the gentleman of that name	1473	“ Chick , ”
32649	32657	32659	32660	Miss Tox	208	“ Oh , hush if you please ! ”
32662	32673	32675	32676	Mr Dombey	190	“ I was about to say to you , Richards , ”
32686	32743	32675	32676	Mr Dombey	190	“ that I was further assisted in my decision , by the recollection of a conversation I held with your husband in this room , on the occasion of your being hired , when he disclosed to me the melancholy fact that your family , himself at the head , were sunk and steeped in ignorance . ”
32753	32761	32744	32744	Richards	227	“ I am far from being friendly , ”
32766	32907	32909	32910	Mr Dombey	190	“ to what is called by persons of levelling sentiments , general education . But it is necessary that the inferior classes should continue to be taught to know their position , and to conduct themselves properly . So far I approve of schools . Having the power of nominating a child on the foundation of an ancient establishment , called ( from a worshipful company ) the Charitable Grinders ; where not only is a wholesome education bestowed upon the scholars , but where a dress and badge is likewise provided for them ; I have ( first communicating , through Mrs Chick , with your family ) nominated your eldest son to an existing vacancy ; and he has this day , I am informed , assumed the habit . The number of her son , I believe , ”
32945	32946	32938	32938	Louisa	204	” “
32954	32958	32938	32938	Louisa	204	” said Mrs Chick “
33005	33013	32999	33001	the articles one	1478	” said Mrs Chick , with enthusiasm , “
33018	33019	33022	33022	Richards	227	” “
33024	33029	33022	33022	Richards	227	” said Miss Tox . “
33043	33044	33045	33045	I	0	” “
33056	33061	33054	33054	Sir	735	” returned Richards faintly , “
33075	33115	33116	33116	I	0	” At the same time a vision of Biler as a Charitable Grinder , with his very small legs encased in the serviceable clothing described by Mrs Chick , swam before Richards ’s eyes , and made them water . “
33130	33135	33128	33128	Richards	227	” said Miss Tox . “
33146	33162	33128	33128	Richards	227	” said Mrs Chick , who prided herself on taking trustful views of human nature , “
33180	33422	33128	33128	Richards	227	” Richards deferred to these compliments by curtseying and murmuring her thanks ; but finding it quite impossible to recover her spirits from the disorder into which they had been thrown by the image of her son in his precocious nether garments , she gradually approached the door and was heartily relieved to escape by it . Such temporary indications of a partial thaw that had appeared with her , vanished with her ; and the frost set in again , as cold and hard as ever . Mr Chick was twice heard to hum a tune at the bottom of the table , but on both occasions it was a fragment of the Dead March in Saul . The party seemed to get colder and colder , and to be gradually resolving itself into a congealed and solid state , like the collation round which it was assembled . At length Mrs Chick looked at Miss Tox , and Miss Tox returned the look , and they both rose and said it was really time to go . Mr Dombey receiving this announcement with perfect equanimity , they took leave of that gentleman , and presently departed under the protection of Mr Chick ; who , when they had turned their backs upon the house and left its master in his usual solitary state , put his hands in his pockets , threw himself back in the carriage , and whistled “
33429	33545	33128	33128	Richards	227	” all through ; conveying into his face as he did so , an expression of such gloomy and terrible defiance , that Mrs Chick dared not protest , or in any way molest him . Richards , though she had little Paul on her lap , could not forget her own first - born . She felt it was ungrateful ; but the influence of the day fell even on the Charitable Grinders , and she could hardly help regarding his pewter badge , number one hundred and forty - seven , as , somehow , a part of its formality and sternness . She spoke , too , in the nursery , of his “
33549	33560	33128	33128	Richards	227	” and was again troubled by his spectre in uniform . “
33571	33575	33566	33566	I	0	” said Polly , “

33603	33615	33600	33601	Mrs Richards	227	” retorted Nipper , who had been admitted to her confidence , “
33624	33625	33626	33627	Mr Dombey	190	” “
33633	33637	33626	33627	Mr Dombey	190	” said Polly . “
33647	33651	33642	33642	he	1482	” retorted Nipper , “
33666	33667	33659	33659	I	0	” “
33680	33684	33687	33688	Mrs Richards	227	” said Polly . “
33693	33697	33699	33699	them	1484	” returned Susan , “
33760	33855	33717	33717	’em	1486	” Polly rejected the idea pretty stoutly at first ; but by little and little she began to entertain it , as she entertained more and more distinctly the forbidden pictures of her children , and her own home . At length , arguing that there could be no great harm in calling for a moment at the door , she yielded to the Nipper proposition . The matter being settled thus , little Paul began to cry most piteously , as if he had a foreboding that no good would come of it . “
33864	33868	33869	33869	He	716	” asked Susan . “
33876	35155	33869	33869	He	716	” said Polly , walking with him to and fro , and hushing him . It was a bleak autumnal afternoon indeed ; and as she walked , and hushed , and , glancing through the dreary windows , pressed the little fellow closer to her breast , the withered leaves came showering down . CHAPTER VI . Paul ’s Second Deprivation Polly was beset by so many misgivings in the morning , that but for the incessant promptings of her black - eyed companion , she would have abandoned all thoughts of the expedition , and formally petitioned for leave to see number one hundred and forty - seven , under the awful shadow of Mr Dombey ’s roof . But Susan who was personally disposed in favour of the excursion , and who ( like Tony Lumpkin ) , if she could bear the disappointments of other people with tolerable fortitude , could not abide to disappoint herself , threw so many ingenious doubts in the way of this second thought , and stimulated the original intention with so many ingenious arguments , that almost as soon as Mr Dombey ’s stately back was turned , and that gentleman was pursuing his daily road towards the City , his unconscious son was on his way to Staggs ’s Gardens . This euphonious locality was situated in a suburb , known by the inhabitants of Staggs ’s Gardens by the name of Camberling Town ; a designation which the Strangers ’ Map of London , as printed ( with a view to pleasant and commodious reference ) on pocket handkerchiefs , condenses , with some show of reason , into Camden Town . Hither the two nurses bent their steps , accompanied by their charges ; Richards carrying Paul , of course , and Susan leading little Florence by the hand , and giving her such jerks and pokes from time to time , as she considered it wholesome to administer . The first shock of a great earthquake had , just at that period , rent the whole neighbourhood to its centre . Traces of its course were visible on every side . Houses were knocked down ; streets broken through and stopped ; deep pits and trenches dug in the ground ; enormous heaps of earth and clay thrown up ; buildings that were undermined and shaking , propped by great beams of wood . Here , a chaos of carts , overthrown and jumbled together , lay topsy - turvy at the bottom of a steep unnatural hill ; there , confused treasures of iron soaked and rusted in something that had accidentally become a pond . Everywhere were bridges that led nowhere ; thoroughfares that were wholly impassable ; Babel towers of chimneys , wanting half their height ; temporary wooden houses and enclosures , in the most unlikely situations ; carcases of ragged tenements , and fragments of unfinished walls and arches , and piles of scaffolding , and wildernesses of bricks , and giant forms of cranes , and tripods straddling above nothing . There were a hundred thousand shapes and substances of incompleteness , wildly mingled out of their places , upside down , burrowing in the earth , aspiring in the air , mouldering in the water , and unintelligible as any dream . Hot springs and fiery eruptions , the usual attendants upon earthquakes , lent their contributions of confusion to the scene . Boiling water hissed and heaved within dilapidated walls ; whence , also , the glare and roar of flames came issuing forth ; and mounds of ashes blocked up rights of way , and wholly changed the law and custom of the neighbourhood . In short , the yet unfinished and unopened Railroad was in progress ; and , from the very core of all this dire disorder , trailed smoothly away , upon its mighty course of civilisation and improvement . But as yet , the neighbourhood was shy to own the Railroad . One or two bold speculators had projected streets ; and one had built a little , but had stopped among the mud and ashes to consider farther of it . A bran - new Tavern , redolent of fresh mortar and size , and fronting nothing at all , had taken for its sign The Railway Arms ; but that might be rash enterprise — and then it hoped to sell drink to the workmen . So , the Excavators ’ House of Call had sprung up from a beer - shop ; and the old - established Ham and Beef Shop had become the Railway Eating House , with a roast leg of pork daily , through interested motives of a similar immediate and popular description . Lodging - house keepers were favourable in like manner ; and for the like reasons were not to be trusted . The general belief was very slow . There were frowzy fields , and cow - houses , and dunghills , and dustheaps , and ditches , and gardens , and summer - houses , and carpet - beating grounds , at the very door of the Railway . Little tumuli of oyster shells in the oyster season , and of lobster shells in the lobster season , and of broken crockery and faded cabbage leaves in all seasons , encroached upon its high places . Posts , and rails , and old cautions to trespassers , and backs of mean houses , and patches of wretched vegetation , stared it out of countenance . Nothing was the better for it , or thought of being so . If the miserable waste ground lying near it could have laughed , it would have laughed it to scorn , like many of the miserable neighbours . Staggs ’s Gardens was uncommonly incredulous . It was a little row of houses , with little squalid patches of ground before them , fenced off with old doors , barrel staves , scraps of tarpaulin , and dead bushes ; with bottomless tin kettles and exhausted iron fenders , thrust into the gaps . Here , the Staggs ’s Gardeners trained scarlet beans , kept fowls and rabbits , erected rotten summer - houses ( one was an old boat ) , dried clothes , and smoked pipes . Some were of opinion that Staggs ’s Gardens derived its name from a deceased capitalist , one Mr Staggs , who had built it for his delectation . Others , who had a natural taste for the country , held that it dated from those rural times when the antlered herd , under the familiar denomination of Staggses , had resorted to its shady precincts . Be this as it may , Staggs ’s Gardens was regarded by its population as a sacred grove not to be withered by Railroads ; and so confident were they generally of its long outliving any such ridiculous inventions , that the master chimney - sweeper at the corner , who was understood to take the lead in the local politics of the Gardens , had publicly declared that on the occasion of the Railroad opening , if ever it did open , two of his boys should ascend the flues of his dwelling , with instructions to hail the failure with derisive cheers from the chimney - pots . To this unhallowed spot , the very name of which had hitherto been carefully concealed from Mr Dombey by his sister , was little Paul now borne by Fate and Richards “
35163	35171	35161	35161	Susan	241	” said Polly , pointing it out . “
35180	35186	35177	35178	Mrs Richards	227	” said Susan , condescendingly . “
35200	35204	35197	35197	I	0	” cried Polly , “
35215	35278	35197	35197	I	0	” The sight added such an extensive pair of wings to Polly ’s impatience , that she set off down the Gardens at a run , and bouncing on Jemima , changed babies with her in a twinkling ; to the unutterable astonishment of that young damsel , on whom the heir of the Dombeys seemed to have fallen from the clouds . “
35283	35287	35288	35288	You	218	” cried Jemima . “
35333	35518	35330	35330	they	947	” That they did , if one might judge from the noise they made , and the way in which they dashed at Polly and dragged her to a low chair in the chimney corner , where her own honest apple face became immediately the centre of a bunch of smaller pippins , all laying their rosy cheeks close to it , and all evidently the growth of the same tree . As to Polly , she was full as noisy and vehement as the children ; and it was not until she was quite out of breath , and her hair was hanging all about her flushed face , and her new christening attire was very much dishevelled , that any pause took place in the confusion . Even then , the smallest Toodle but one remained in her lap , holding on tight with both arms round her neck ; while the smallest Toodle but two mounted on the back of the chair , and made desperate efforts , with one leg in the air , to kiss her round the corner . “
35532	35536	35523	35526	a pretty little lady	1495	” said Polly ; “
35554	35614	35552	35552	she	1495	” This reference to Florence , who had been standing by the door not unobservant of what passed , directed the attention of the younger branches towards her ; and had likewise the happy effect of leading to the formal recognition of Miss Nipper , who was not quite free from a misgiving that she had been already slighted . “
35629	35633	35625	35625	Susan	241	” said Polly . “
35675	35676	35682	35683	Miss Nipper	241	” “
35689	35709	35686	35686	you	241	” quoth Jemima . Susan took the extreme corner of a chair , with a stately and ceremonious aspect . “
35732	35751	35729	35730	Miss Nipper	241	” said Jemima . Susan relaxing , took a little more of the chair , and smiled graciously . “
35770	35774	35765	35766	Miss Nipper	241	” entreated Jemima . “
35799	35832	35795	35795	I	0	” The black - eyed was so softened by this deferential behaviour , that she caught up little Miss Toodle who was running past , and took her to Banbury Cross immediately . “
35840	35844	35845	35847	My poor fellow	1503	” said Polly . “
35862	35863	35849	35849	I	0	” “
35869	35873	35874	35874	He	1502	” cried Jemima . “
35896	35897	35889	35889	He	1502	” “
35901	35902	35889	35889	He	1502	” “
35947	35964	35942	35943	Miss Nipper	241	” said Jemima , mindful in good time of the dignity of the black - eyed . “
35976	35980	35971	35971	Jemima	220	” faltered Polly . “
35995	35999	35984	35984	he	1502	” returned Jemima . “
36002	36009	35984	35984	he	1502	” said Polly , with emotion , “
36019	36020	36010	36010	I	0	” “
36026	36030	36010	36010	I	0	” returned Jemima ; “
36045	36093	36040	36040	Polly	218	” It was a slow , prospective kind of consolation ; but the cheerfulness and good nature with which it was administered , gave it a value it did not intrinsically possess . After a moment ’s silence , Polly asked , in a more sprightly manner : “
36100	36115	36040	36040	Polly	218	dear?”—for by that patriarchal appellation , Mr Toodle was generally known in the family . “
36119	36123	36040	36040	Polly	218	” said Jemima . “
36185	36186	36178	36178	he	284	” “
36191	36208	36189	36189	Jemima	220	” cried the simple Polly ; delighted by the speech , and disappointed by the absence . “
36218	36239	36216	36216	Polly	218	” said her sister , giving her a sounding kiss upon the cheek , and then dancing little Paul cheerfully . “
36253	36749	36240	36240	I	0	” In spite of the double disappointment , it was impossible to regard in the light of a failure a visit which was greeted with such a reception ; so the sisters talked hopefully about family matters , and about Biler , and about all his brothers and sisters : while the black - eyed , having performed several journeys to Banbury Cross and back , took sharp note of the furniture , the Dutch clock , the cupboard , the castle on the mantel - piece with red and green windows in it , susceptible of illumination by a candle - end within ; and the pair of small black velvet kittens , each with a lady ’s reticule in its mouth ; regarded by the Staggs ’s Gardeners as prodigies of imitative art . The conversation soon becoming general lest the black - eyed should go off at score and turn sarcastic , that young lady related to Jemima a summary of everything she knew concerning Mr Dombey , his prospects , family , pursuits , and character . Also an exact inventory of her personal wardrobe , and some account of her principal relations and friends . Having relieved her mind of these disclosures , she partook of shrimps and porter , and evinced a disposition to swear eternal friendship . Little Florence herself was not behind - hand in improving the occasion ; for , being conducted forth by the young Toodles to inspect some toad - stools and other curiosities of the Gardens , she entered with them , heart and soul , on the formation of a temporary breakwater across a small green pool that had collected in a corner . She was still busily engaged in that labour , when sought and found by Susan ; who , such was her sense of duty , even under the humanizing influence of shrimps , delivered a moral address to her ( punctuated with thumps ) on her degenerate nature , while washing her face and hands ; and predicted that she would bring the grey hairs of her family in general , with sorrow to the grave . After some delay , occasioned by a pretty long confidential interview above stairs on pecuniary subjects , between Polly and Jemima , an interchange of babies was again effected — for Polly had all this time retained her own child , and Jemima little Paul — and the visitors took leave . But first the young Toodles , victims of a pious fraud , were deluded into repairing in a body to a chandler ’s shop in the neighbourhood , for the ostensible purpose of spending a penny ; and when the coast was quite clear , Polly fled : Jemima calling after her that if they could only go round towards the City Road on their way back , they would be sure to meet little Biler coming from school . “
36769	36780	36751	36751	you	1513	” inquired Polly , when they halted to take breath . “
36787	36791	36784	36785	Mrs Richards	227	” returned Susan . “
36803	36834	36784	36785	Mrs Richards	227	” said Polly . But lunch had rendered her companion more than indifferent to this grave consideration , so she allowed no weight to it , and they resolved to go “
36839	37304	36784	36785	Mrs Richards	227	” Now , it happened that poor Biler ’s life had been , since yesterday morning , rendered weary by the costume of the Charitable Grinders . The youth of the streets could not endure it . No young vagabond could be brought to bear its contemplation for a moment , without throwing himself upon the unoffending wearer , and doing him a mischief . His social existence had been more like that of an early Christian , than an innocent child of the nineteenth century . He had been stoned in the streets . He had been overthrown into gutters ; bespattered with mud ; violently flattened against posts . Entire strangers to his person had lifted his yellow cap off his head , and cast it to the winds . His legs had not only undergone verbal criticisms and revilings , but had been handled and pinched . That very morning , he had received a perfectly unsolicited black eye on his way to the Grinders ’ establishment , and had been punished for it by the master : a superannuated old Grinder of savage disposition , who had been appointed schoolmaster because he did n’t know anything , and was n’t fit for anything , and for whose cruel cane all chubby little boys had a perfect fascination . Thus it fell out that Biler , on his way home , sought unfrequented paths ; and slunk along by narrow passages and back streets , to avoid his tormentors . Being compelled to emerge into the main road , his ill fortune brought him at last where a small party of boys , headed by a ferocious young butcher , were lying in wait for any means of pleasurable excitement that might happen . These , finding a Charitable Grinder in the midst of them — unaccountably delivered over , as it were , into their hands — set up a general yell and rushed upon him . But it so fell out likewise , that , at the same time , Polly , looking hopelessly along the road before her , after a good hour ’s walk , had said it was no use going any further , when suddenly she saw this sight . She no sooner saw it than , uttering a hasty exclamation , and giving Master Dombey to the black - eyed , she started to the rescue of her unhappy little son . Surprises , like misfortunes , rarely come alone . The astonished Susan Nipper and her two young charges were rescued by the bystanders from under the very wheels of a passing carriage before they knew what had happened ; and at that moment ( it was market day ) a thundering alarm of “
37308	37419	37420	37420	Susan	241	” was raised . With a wild confusion before her , of people running up and down , and shouting , and wheels running over them , and boys fighting , and mad bulls coming up , and the nurse in the midst of all these dangers being torn to pieces , Florence screamed and ran . She ran till she was exhausted , urging Susan to do the same ; and then , stopping and wringing her hands as she remembered they had left the other nurse behind , found , with a sensation of terror not to be described , that she was quite alone . [ Illustration ] “
37424	37439	37422	37422	Susan	241	” cried Florence , clapping her hands in the very ecstasy of her alarm . “
37450	37451	37454	37454	they	1515	” “
37456	37478	37454	37454	they	1515	” said an old woman , coming hobbling across as fast as she could from the opposite side of the way . “
37487	37488	37481	37481	you	1516	” “
37493	37497	37498	37498	I	0	” answered Florence . “
37517	37530	37531	37531	I	0	” The old woman took her by the wrist , and said , “
37536	37682	37531	37531	I	0	” She was a very ugly old woman , with red rims round her eyes , and a mouth that mumbled and chattered of itself when she was not speaking . She was miserably dressed , and carried some skins over her arm . She seemed to have followed Florence some little way at all events , for she had lost her breath ; and this made her uglier still , as she stood trying to regain it : working her shrivelled yellow face and throat into all sorts of contortions . Florence was afraid of her , and looked , hesitating , up the street , of which she had almost reached the bottom . It was a solitary place — more a back road than a street — and there was no one in it but her - self and the old woman . “
37690	37701	37683	37683	You	1517	” said the old woman , still holding her tight . “
37707	37708	37709	37709	I	0	” “
37722	37726	37727	37728	Mrs Brown	285	” asked Florence . “
37730	37736	37727	37728	Mrs Brown	285	” said the old woman . “
37741	37742	37738	37739	Mrs Brown	285	” “
37748	37758	37759	37759	Susan	241	” asked Florence , beginning to be led away . “
37765	37771	37773	37774	the others	1520	” said Good Mrs Brown ; “
37780	37781	37773	37774	the others	1520	” “
37786	37790	37773	37774	the others	1520	” cried Florence . “
37797	38025	37773	37774	the others	1520	” said Good Mrs Brown . The child shed tears of delight on hearing this , and accompanied the old woman willingly ; though she could not help glancing at her face as they went along — particularly at that industrious mouth — and wondering whether Bad Mrs Brown , if there were such a person , was at all like her . They had not gone far , but had gone by some very uncomfortable places , such as brick - fields and tile - yards , when the old woman turned down a dirty lane , where the mud lay in deep black ruts in the middle of the road . She stopped before a shabby little house , as closely shut up as a house that was full of cracks and crevices could be . Opening the door with a key she took out of her bonnet , she pushed the child before her into a back room , where there was a great heap of rags of different colours lying on the floor ; a heap of bones , and a heap of sifted dust or cinders ; but there was no furniture at all , and the walls and ceiling were quite black . The child became so terrified the she was stricken speechless , and looked as though about to swoon . “
38034	38046	38030	38032	a young mule	1522	” said Good Mrs Brown , reviving her with a shake . “
38061	38076	38077	38077	I	0	” Florence obeyed her , holding out her folded hands , in mute supplication . “
38092	38097	38098	38098	D’ye	269	” said Mrs Brown . “
38104	38112	38101	38101	I	0	” The child answered with great difficulty , “
38115	38116	38101	38101	I	0	” “
38119	38133	38101	38101	I	0	” said Good Mrs Brown , taking her own seat on the bones , “
38201	38280	38285	38285	Dombey	190	” The old woman ’s threats and promises ; the dread of giving her offence ; and the habit , unusual to a child , but almost natural to Florence now , of being quiet , and repressing what she felt , and feared , and hoped ; enabled her to do this bidding , and to tell her little history , or what she knew of it . Mrs Brown listened attentively , until she had finished . “
38289	38294	38285	38285	Dombey	190	” said Mrs Brown . “
38304	38310	38301	38302	Miss Dombey	287	” said Good Mrs Brown , “
38335	38395	38332	38332	’em	1525	” Florence obeyed , as fast as her trembling hands would allow ; keeping , all the while , a frightened eye on Mrs Brown . When she had divested herself of all the articles of apparel mentioned by that lady , Mrs B. examined them at leisure , and seemed tolerably well satisfied with their quality and value . “
38398	38412	38413	38413	I	0	” she said , running her eyes over the child ’s slight figure , “
38433	38610	38430	38431	Miss Dombey	287	” Poor little Florence took them off with equal alacrity , only too glad to have any more means of conciliation about her . The old woman then produced some wretched substitutes from the bottom of the heap of rags , which she turned up for that purpose ; together with a girl ’s cloak , quite worn out and very old ; and the crushed remains of a bonnet that had probably been picked up from some ditch or dunghill . In this dainty raiment , she instructed Florence to dress herself ; and as such preparation seemed a prelude to her release , the child complied with increased readiness , if possible . In hurriedly putting on the bonnet , if that may be called a bonnet which was more like a pad to carry loads on , she caught it in her hair which grew luxuriantly , and could not immediately disentangle it . Good Mrs Brown whipped out a large pair of scissors , and fell into an unaccountable state of excitement . “
38619	38624	38614	38614	you	287	” said Mrs Brown , “
38634	38635	38631	38632	little fool	1526	” “
38650	38654	38641	38641	I	0	” panted Florence . “
38661	38662	38655	38655	I	0	” “
38668	38673	38655	38655	I	0	” cried Mrs Brown . “
38687	38701	38685	38685	Lord	1527	” said the old woman , ruffling her curls with a furious pleasure , “
38715	38759	38685	38685	Lord	1527	” Florence was so relieved to find that it was only her hair and not her head which Mrs Brown coveted , that she offered no resistance or entreaty , and merely raised her mild eyes towards the face of that good soul . “
38783	38788	38789	38789	I	0	” said Mrs Brown , “
38812	39865	38803	38803	she	1528	” Mrs Brown ’s was not a melodious cry , but , accompanied with a wild tossing up of her lean arms , it was full of passionate grief , and thrilled to the heart of Florence , whom it frightened more than ever . It had its part , perhaps , in saving her curls ; for Mrs Brown , after hovering about her with the scissors for some moments , like a new kind of butterfly , bade her hide them under the bonnet and let no trace of them escape to tempt her . Having accomplished this victory over herself , Mrs Brown resumed her seat on the bones , and smoked a very short black pipe , mowing and mumbling all the time , as if she were eating the stem . When the pipe was smoked out , she gave the child a rabbit - skin to carry , that she might appear the more like her ordinary companion , and told her that she was now going to lead her to a public street whence she could inquire her way to her friends . But she cautioned her , with threats of summary and deadly vengeance in case of disobedience , not to talk to strangers , nor to repair to her own home ( which may have been too near for Mrs Brown ’s convenience ) , but to her father ’s office in the City ; also to wait at the street corner where she would be left , until the clock struck three . These directions Mrs Brown enforced with assurances that there would be potent eyes and ears in her employment cognizant of all she did ; and these directions Florence promised faithfully and earnestly to observe . At length , Mrs Brown , issuing forth , conducted her changed and ragged little friend through a labyrinth of narrow streets and lanes and alleys , which emerged , after a long time , upon a stable yard , with a gateway at the end , whence the roar of a great thoroughfare made itself audible . Pointing out this gateway , and informing Florence that when the clocks struck three she was to go to the left , Mrs Brown , after making a parting grasp at her hair which seemed involuntary and quite beyond her own control , told her she knew what to do , and bade her go and do it : remembering that she was watched . With a lighter heart , but still sore afraid , Florence felt herself released , and tripped off to the corner . When she reached it , she looked back and saw the head of Good Mrs Brown peeping out of the low wooden passage , where she had issued her parting injunctions ; likewise the fist of Good Mrs Brown shaking towards her . But though she often looked back afterwards — every minute , at least , in her nervous recollection of the old woman — she could not see her again . Florence remained there , looking at the bustle in the street , and more and more bewildered by it ; and in the meanwhile the clocks appeared to have made up their minds never to strike three any more . At last the steeples rang out three o’clock ; there was one close by , so she could n’t be mistaken ; and — after often looking over her shoulder , and often going a little way , and as often coming back again , lest the all - powerful spies of Mrs Brown should take offence — she hurried off , as fast as she could in her slipshod shoes , holding the rabbit - skin tight in her hand . All she knew of her father ’s offices was that they belonged to Dombey and Son , and that that was a great power belonging to the City . So she could only ask the way to Dombey and Son ’s in the City ; and as she generally made inquiry of children — being afraid to ask grown people — she got very little satisfaction indeed . But by dint of asking her way to the City after a while , and dropping the rest of her inquiry for the present , she really did advance , by slow degrees , towards the heart of that great region which is governed by the terrible Lord Mayor . Tired of walking , repulsed and pushed about , stunned by the noise and confusion , anxious for her brother and the nurses , terrified by what she had undergone , and the prospect of encountering her angry father in such an altered state ; perplexed and frightened alike by what had passed , and what was passing , and what was yet before her ; Florence went upon her weary way with tearful eyes , and once or twice could not help stopping to ease her bursting heart by crying bitterly . But few people noticed her at those times , in the garb she wore : or if they did , believed that she was tutored to excite compassion , and passed on . Florence , too , called to her aid all the firmness and self - reliance of a character that her sad experience had prematurely formed and tried : and keeping the end she had in view steadily before her , steadily pursued it . It was full two hours later in the afternoon than when she had started on this strange adventure , when , escaping from the clash and clangour of a narrow street full of carts and waggons , she peeped into a kind of wharf or landing - place upon the river - side , where there were a great many packages , casks , and boxes , strewn about ; a large pair of wooden scales ; and a little wooden house on wheels , outside of which , looking at the neighbouring masts and boats , a stout man stood whistling , with his pen behind his ear , and his hands in his pockets , as if his day ’s work were nearly done . “
39869	39879	38803	38803	she	1528	” said this man , happening to turn round . “
39894	39895	39897	39897	you	1532	” “
39905	39914	39897	39897	you	1532	” asked the trembling daughter of the Dombeys . “
39942	39943	39934	39934	We	1529	” “
39953	39959	39951	39951	you	1532	” was the timid answer . “
39971	39997	39966	39966	Dombey	187	” The man who had been strolling carelessly towards her , seemed surprised by this reply , and looking attentively in her face , rejoined : “
40010	40011	40002	40002	you	1530	” “
40022	40052	40053	40053	Joe	290	” The man looked at her yet more curiously , and rubbed the back of his head so hard in his wonderment that he knocked his own hat off . “
40055	40076	40077	40077	Joe	290	” he called to another man — a labourer — as he picked it up and put it on again . “
40081	40085	40053	40053	Joe	290	” said Joe . “
40104	40105	40088	40102	that young spark of Dombey ’s who ’s been watching the shipment of them goods	1537	” “
40113	40117	40119	40119	him	1537	” said Joe . “
40124	40147	40119	40119	him	1537	” Joe ran up an archway , bawling as he went , and very soon returned with a blithe - looking boy . “
40158	40164	40148	40148	You	1538	” said the first man . “
40175	40180	40172	40173	Mr Clark	291	” returned the boy . “
40186	40286	40287	40287	I	0	” said Mr Clark . Obedient to the indication of Mr Clark ’s hand , the boy approached towards Florence , wondering , as well he might , what he had to do with her . But she , who had heard what passed , and who , besides the relief of so suddenly considering herself safe at her journey ’s end , felt reassured beyond all measure by his lively youthful face and manner , ran eagerly up to him , leaving one of the slipshod shoes upon the ground and caught his hand in both of hers . “
40295	40299	40292	40292	you	291	” said Florence . “
40302	40307	40292	40292	you	291	” cried the boy . “
40373	40535	40370	40370	you	291	” sobbed Florence , giving full vent to the childish feelings she had so long suppressed , and bursting into tears . At the same time her miserable bonnet falling off , her hair came tumbling down about her face : moving to speechless admiration and commiseration , young Walter , nephew of Solomon Gills , Ships ’ Instrument - maker in general . Mr Clark stood rapt in amazement : observing under his breath , I never saw such a start on this wharf before . Walter picked up the shoe , and put it on the little foot as the Prince in the story might have fitted Cinderella ’s slipper on . He hung the rabbit - skin over his left arm ; gave the right to Florence ; and felt , not to say like Richard Whittington — that is a tame comparison — but like Saint George of England , with the dragon lying dead before him . “
40543	40553	40540	40541	Miss Dombey	287	” said Walter , in a transport of enthusiasm . “
40598	40599	40600	40600	I	0	” “
40607	40611	40600	40600	I	0	” said Florence . “
40619	40620	40612	40612	I	0	” “
40625	40629	40612	40612	I	0	” thought Walter , “
40658	40659	40655	40656	Miss Dombey	287	” “
40666	40682	40655	40656	Miss Dombey	287	” said Florence , checking him in the act of impetuously pulling off his own . “
40692	40693	40655	40656	Miss Dombey	287	” “
40700	40709	40655	40656	Miss Dombey	287	” said Walter , glancing at her foot , “
40748	40885	40737	40737	me	0	” So Walter , looking immensely fierce , led off Florence , looking very happy ; and they went arm - in - arm along the streets , perfectly indifferent to any astonishment that their appearance might or did excite by the way . It was growing dark and foggy , and beginning to rain too ; but they cared nothing for this : being both wholly absorbed in the late adventures of Florence , which she related with the innocent good faith and confidence of her years , while Walter listened as if , far from the mud and grease of Thames Street , they were rambling alone among the broad leaves and tall trees of some desert island in the tropics — as he very likely fancied , for the time , they were . “
40892	40908	40737	40737	me	0	” asked Florence at last , lilting up her eyes to her companion ’s face . “
40917	40923	40737	40737	me	0	” said Walter , stopping , “
41020	41021	41022	41022	I	0	” “
41026	41030	41022	41022	I	0	” answered Florence . “
41040	41084	41037	41037	you	0	” As they stood deliberating in the street , a man passed them , who glanced quickly at Walter as he went by , as if he recognised him ; but seeming to correct that first impression , he passed on without stopping . “
41094	41098	41091	41092	Mr Carker	274	” said Walter . “
41124	41125	41121	41122	Mr Carker	274	” “
41131	41140	41128	41129	Walter Gay	293	” said the other , stopping and returning . “
41153	41432	41149	41151	a strange companion	1561	” As he stood near a lamp , listening with surprise to Walter ’s hurried explanation , he presented a remarkable contrast to the two youthful figures arm - in - arm before him . He was not old , but his hair was white ; his body was bent , or bowed as if by the weight of some great trouble : and there were deep lines in his worn and melancholy face . The fire of his eyes , the expression of his features , the very voice in which he spoke , were all subdued and quenched , as if the spirit within him lay in ashes . He was respectably , though very plainly dressed , in black ; but his clothes , moulded to the general character of his figure , seemed to shrink and abase themselves upon him , and to join in the sorrowful solicitation which the whole man from head to foot expressed , to be left unnoticed , and alone in his humility . And yet his interest in youth and hopefulness was not extinguished with the other embers of his soul , for he watched the boy ’s earnest countenance as he spoke with unusual sympathy , though with an inexplicable show of trouble and compassion , which escaped into his looks , however hard he strove to hold it prisoner . When Walter , in conclusion , put to him the question he had put to Florence , he still stood glancing at him with the same expression , as if he had read some fate upon his face , mournfully at variance with its present brightness . “
41441	41447	41435	41435	you	1562	” said Walter , smiling . “
41472	41473	41474	41474	I	0	” “
41483	41497	41498	41499	Mr Carker	274	” he answered : looking from Florence to Walter , and back again . “
41501	41511	41498	41499	Mr Carker	274	” said Walter , brightening with a generous thought , “
41555	41556	41557	41557	I	0	” “
41559	41564	41557	41557	I	0	” returned the other . “
41573	41618	41570	41571	Mr Carker	274	” said the boy . He merely shook him by the hand in answer ; he seemed in a manner ashamed and afraid even to do that ; and bidding him good - night , and advising him to make haste , turned away . “
41624	41637	41621	41622	Miss Dombey	287	” said Walter , looking after him as they turned away also , “
41667	41668	41655	41656	Mr Dombey	190	” “
41671	41678	41655	41656	Mr Dombey	190	” returned the child , mildly , “
41687	41688	41684	41684	Papa	242	” “
41698	41730	41731	41733	The strangest man	1568	” thought Walter . After a minute ’s pause , during which he had been looking down upon the gentle patient little face moving on at his side , he said , “
41836	41967	41968	41968	Holloa	294	” As Florence could hardly be expected to understand much about it , Walter bestirred himself with his accustomed boyish animation and restlessness to change the subject ; and one of the unfortunate shoes coming off again opportunely , proposed to carry Florence to his uncle ’s in his arms . Florence , though very tired , laughingly declined the proposal , lest he should let her fall ; and as they were already near the wooden Midshipman , and as Walter went on to cite various precedents , from shipwrecks and other moving accidents , where younger boys than he had triumphantly rescued and carried off older girls than Florence , they were still in full conversation about it when they arrived at the Instrument - maker ’s door . “
41973	42002	41970	41971	Uncle Sol	250	” cried Walter , bursting into the shop , and speaking incoherently and out of breath , from that time forth , for the rest of the evening . “
42048	42049	42030	42031	a woman	1577	” “
42053	42067	42030	42031	a woman	1577	” said Uncle Sol , starting back against his favourite compass - case . “
42077	42078	42075	42075	I	0	” “
42085	42093	42075	42075	I	0	” said Walter , anticipating the rest . “
42180	42283	42168	42168	Uncle	1586	” Solomon Gills was quite as hot , by sympathy , and in excessive bewilderment . He patted Florence ’s head , pressed her to eat , pressed her to drink , rubbed the soles of her feet with his pocket - handkerchief heated at the fire , followed his locomotive nephew with his eyes , and ears , and had no clear perception of anything except that he was being constantly knocked against and tumbled over by that excited young gentleman , as he darted about the room attempting to accomplish twenty things at once , and doing nothing at all . “
42292	42301	42290	42290	Uncle	1587	” he continued , catching up a candle , “
42331	42332	42320	42320	I	0	” “
42337	42376	42320	42320	I	0	” said Solomon , who , with his spectacles on his forehead and the great chronometer in his pocket , was incessantly oscillating between Florence on the sofa , and his nephew in all parts of the parlour , “
42383	42384	42320	42320	I	0	” “
42406	42407	42404	42404	Uncle	10023	” “
42414	42435	42404	42404	Uncle	10023	” cried Solomon , cutting instantly into a leg of mutton , as if he were catering for a giant . “
42475	42570	42470	42473	Lord Mayor of London	10142	” Walter was not very long in mounting to his lofty garret and descending from it , but in the meantime Florence , overcome by fatigue , had sunk into a doze before the fire . The short interval of quiet , though only a few minutes in duration , enabled Solomon Gills so far to collect his wits as to make some little arrangements for her comfort , and to darken the room , and to screen her from the blaze . Thus , when the boy returned , she was sleeping peacefully . “
42575	42594	42470	42473	Lord Mayor of London	10142	” he whispered , giving Solomon such a hug that it squeezed a new expression into his face . “
42626	42627	42623	42624	Uncle Sol	250	” “
42632	42636	42637	42638	Pretty child	1597	” said Solomon . “
42640	42641	42637	42638	Pretty child	1597	” “
42646	42650	42651	42651	I	0	” cried Walter . “
42666	42667	42662	42662	I	0	” “
42672	42679	42680	42680	I	0	” said Solomon , greatly relieved . “
42686	42698	42683	42684	Uncle Sol	250	” cried Walter , putting his face in at the door . “
42704	42708	42700	42700	he	250	” said Solomon . “
42715	42716	42711	42711	she	1596	” “
42720	42724	42711	42711	she	1596	” said Solomon . “
42734	42735	42730	42730	I	0	” “
42741	42747	42748	42748	I	0	” said Solomon to himself . “
42754	42763	42748	42748	I	0	” cried Walter , reappearing at the door . “
42769	42773	42765	42765	he	250	” said Solomon . “
42846	42847	42840	42840	she	1603	” “
42857	42862	42855	42855	Wally	293	” replied Uncle Sol . “
42872	43062	42868	42868	I	0	” And this time he really was : and Solomon Gills , with no appetite for dinner , sat on the opposite side of the fire , watching Florence in her slumber , building a great many airy castles of the most fantastic architecture ; and looking , in the dim shade , and in the close vicinity of all the instruments , like a magician disguised in a Welsh wig and a suit of coffee colour , who held the child in an enchanted sleep . In the meantime , Walter proceeded towards Mr Dombey ’s house at a pace seldom achieved by a hack horse from the stand ; and yet with his head out of window every two or three minutes , in impatient remonstrance with the driver . Arriving at his journey ’s end , he leaped out , and breathlessly announcing his errand to the servant , followed him straight into the library , we there was a great confusion of tongues , and where Mr Dombey , his sister , and Miss Tox , Richards , and Nipper , were all congregated together . “
43072	43081	43070	43070	Sir	735	” said Walter , rushing up to him , “
43100	43139	43140	43140	I	0	” The boy with his open face , and flowing hair , and sparkling eyes , panting with pleasure and excitement , was wonderfully opposed to Mr Dombey , as he sat confronting him in his library chair . “
43153	43175	43140	43140	I	0	” said Mr Dombey , looking slightly over his shoulder at that lady , who wept in company with Miss Tox . “
43217	43225	43210	43210	I	0	” Here he looked majestically at Richards . “
43236	43237	43210	43210	I	0	” “
43249	43254	43247	43247	Sir	735	” said Walter modestly , “
43283	43284	43287	43287	you	735	” “
43292	43316	43287	43287	you	735	” interrupted Mr Dombey , regarding the boy ’s evident pride and pleasure in his share of the transaction with an instinctive dislike , “
43341	43377	43378	43378	You	735	” It was quite out of Walter ’s power to be coherent ; but he rendered himself as explanatory as he could , in his breathless state , and stated why he had come alone . “
43384	43395	43378	43378	You	735	” said Mr Dombey sternly to the black - eyed . “
43424	43425	43414	43414	Gay	293	” “
43433	43437	43431	43431	Sir	735	” said Walter . “
43456	43457	43454	43454	Sir	735	” “
43463	43473	43460	43461	a boy	9790	” said Mr Dombey , suddenly and almost fiercely ; “
43513	43699	43503	43503	Louisa	204	” Mr Dombey ’s glance followed Walter Gay with sharp disfavour , as he left the room under the pilotage of Mrs Chick ; and it may be that his mind ’s eye followed him with no greater relish , as he rode back to his Uncle ’s with Miss Susan Nipper . There they found that Florence , much refreshed by sleep , had dined , and greatly improved the acquaintance of Solomon Gills , with whom she was on terms of perfect confidence and ease . The black - eyed ( who had cried so much that she might now be called the red - eyed , and who was very silent and depressed ) caught her in her arms without a word of contradiction or reproach , and made a very hysterical meeting of it . Then converting the parlour , for the nonce , into a private tiring room , she dressed her , with great care , in proper clothes ; and presently led her forth , as like a Dombey as her natural disqualifications admitted of her being made . “
43704	43713	43503	43503	Louisa	204	” said Florence , running up to Solomon . “
43722	43738	43714	43714	You	1627	” Old Sol was quite delighted , and kissed her like her grand - father . “
43749	43753	43790	43790	Walter	293	” said Florence . “
43758	43767	43790	43790	Walter	293	” said Walter , giving both his hands . “
43774	43778	43768	43768	I	0	” pursued Florence . “
43792	43835	43790	43790	Walter	293	” In the innocence of her grateful heart , the child lifted up her face to his . Walter , bending down his own , raised it again , all red and burning ; and looked at Uncle Sol , quite sheepishly . “
43840	43841	43846	43846	Walter	293	” “
43848	43849	43846	43846	Walter	293	” “
43856	43857	43854	43854	Walter	293	” “
43865	43969	43863	43863	Walter	293	” This was still Florence ’s cry , after she was shut up with her little maid , in the coach . And when the coach at length moved off , Walter on the door - step gaily returned the waving of her handkerchief , while the wooden Midshipman behind him seemed , like himself , intent upon that coach alone , excluding all the other passing coaches from his observation . In good time Mr Dombey ’s mansion was gained again , and again there was a noise of tongues in the library . Again , too , the coach was ordered to wait—“for
43973	44124	43970	43971	Mrs Richards	227	” one of Susan ’s fellow - servants ominously whispered , as she passed with Florence . The entrance of the lost child made a slight sensation , but not much . Mr Dombey , who had never found her , kissed her once upon the forehead , and cautioned her not to run away again , or wander anywhere with treacherous attendants . Mrs Chick stopped in her lamentations on the corruption of human nature , even when beckoned to the paths of virtue by a Charitable Grinder ; and received her with a welcome something short of the reception due to none but perfect Dombeys . Miss Tox regulated her feelings by the models before her . Richards , the culprit Richards , alone poured out her heart in broken words of welcome , and bowed herself over the little wandering head as if she really loved it . “
44129	44138	44127	44127	Richards	227	” said Mrs Chick , with a sigh . “
44193	44197	44199	44200	Miss Tox	208	“ Cut off , ”
44207	44213	44199	44200	Miss Tox	208	“ from one common fountain ! ”
44214	44222	44224	44225	Mrs Chick	208	“ If it was my ungrateful case , ”
44229	44259	44224	44225	Mrs Chick	208	“ and I had your reflections , Richards , I should feel as if the Charitable Grinders ’ dress would blight my child , and the education choke him . ”
44311	44314	44316	44317	Mr Dombey	190	“ Louisa ! ”
44319	44351	44353	44354	Mr Dombey	190	“ It is not necessary to prolong these observations . The woman is discharged and paid . You leave this house , Richards , for taking my son — my son , ”
44362	44447	44353	44354	Mr Dombey	190	“ into haunts and into society which are not to be thought of without a shudder . As to the accident which befel Miss Florence this morning , I regard that as , in one great sense , a happy and fortunate circumstance ; inasmuch as , but for that occurrence , I never could have known — and from your own lips too — of what you had been guilty . I think , Louisa , the other nurse , the young person , ”
44454	44483	44449	44450	Miss Nipper	241	“ being so much younger , and necessarily influenced by Paul ’s nurse , may remain . Have the goodness to direct that this woman ’s coach is paid to”—Mr
44487	44492	44484	44484	Dombey	190	winced—“to Staggs ’s Gardens . ”
45153	45159	45148	45148	she	208	“ something so truly military ; ”
45202	45205	45201	45205	a “ native , ”	10603	“ native , ”
45823	45829	45830	45831	the Major	1679	“ Joey B. , Sir , ”
45844	45926	45839	45839	his	1679	“ is worth a dozen of you . If you had a few more of the Bagstock breed among you , Sir , you ’d be none the worse for it . Old Joe , Sir , need n’t look far for a wife even now , if he was on the look - out ; but he ’s hard - hearted , Sir , is Joe — he ’s tough , Sir , tough , and de - vilish sly ! ”
46109	46115	46117	46118	the Major	1679	“ Good morning , Ma’am , ”
46139	46145	46147	46148	Miss Tox	208	“ Good morning , Sir , ”
46153	46159	46161	46162	the Major	1679	“ Joe Bagstock , Ma’am , ”

46216	46230	46232	46233	the Major	1679	“ Joe ’s luminary has been out of town , Ma’am , perhaps , ”
46235	46253	46255	46256	Miss Tox	208	“ I ? out of town ? oh no , I have not been out of town , ”
46258	46295	46255	46256	Miss Tox	208	“ I have been much engaged lately . My time is nearly all devoted to some very intimate friends . I am afraid I have none to spare , even now . Good morning , Sir ! ”
46337	46344	46346	46347	the Major	1679	“ Why , damme , Sir , ”
46366	46388	46350	46350	his	1679	“ six months ago , the woman loved the ground Josh Bagstock walked on . What ’s the meaning of it ? ”
46416	46426	46428	46429	the Major	1679	“ But you wo n’t catch Joe , Ma’am , ”
46431	46450	46428	46429	the Major	1679	“ He ’s tough , Ma’am , tough , is J.B. Tough , and de - vilish sly ! ”
46817	46825	46827	46828	the Major	1679	“ It ’s a Baby , Sir , ”
46836	46842	46827	46828	the Major	1679	“ for fifty thousand pounds ! ”
47115	47135	47137	47138	Mrs Chick	208	“ You ’ll quite win my brother Paul ’s heart , and that ’s the truth , my dear , ”
47148	47157	47159	47160	Mrs Chick	208	“ He grows more like Paul every day , ”
47190	47197	47199	47200	Miss Tox	208	“ His mother , my dear , ”
47202	47220	47199	47200	Miss Tox	208	“ whose acquaintance I was to have made through you , does he at all resemble her ? ”
47221	47226	47228	47228	Louisa	204	“ Not at all , ”
47229	47240	47242	47243	Miss Tox	208	“ She was — she was pretty , I believe ? ”
47245	47254	47256	47257	Mrs Chick	208	“ Why , poor dear Fanny was interesting , ”
47264	47312	47256	47257	Mrs Chick	208	“ Certainly interesting . She had not that air of commanding superiority which one would somehow expect , almost as a matter of course , to find in my brother ’s wife ; nor had she that strength and vigour of mind which such a man requires . ”
47320	47326	47328	47329	Mrs Chick	208	“ But she was pleasing : ”
47331	47347	47328	47329	Mrs Chick	208	“ extremely so . And she meant!—oh , dear , how well poor Fanny meant ! ”
47348	47352	47354	47355	Miss Tox	208	“ You Angel ! ”
47360	47368	47357	47358	little Paul	220	“ You Picture of your own Papa ! ”

49143	49146	49140	49140	he	190	“ Money ? ”
49147	49150	49152	49153	the child	716	“ Yes , ”
49177	49182	49152	49153	the child	716	“ what is money ? ”
49253	49276	49250	49250	he	190	“ Gold , and silver , and copper . Guineas , shillings , half - pence . You know what they are ? ”
49277	49287	49289	49289	Paul	220	“ Oh yes , I know what they are , ”
49291	49308	49289	49289	Paul	220	“ I do n’t mean that , Papa . I mean what ’s money after all ? ”
49329	49336	49338	49339	Mr Dombey	190	“ What is money after all ! ”
49366	49377	49379	49379	Paul	220	“ I mean , Papa , what can it do ? ”
49434	49448	49449	49449	he	190	“ You ’ll know better by - and - by , my man , ”
49452	49461	49462	49462	He	190	“ Money , Paul , can do anything . ”
49551	49556	49566	49567	Mr Dombey	190	“ Anything , Papa ? ”
49557	49564	49566	49567	Mr Dombey	190	“ Yes . Anything — almost , ”
49569	49580	49566	49567	Mr Dombey	190	“ Anything means everything , do n’t it , Papa ? ”
49596	49603	49605	49606	Mr Dombey	190	“ It includes it : yes , ”
49608	49618	49620	49621	the child	716	“ Why did n’t money save me my Mama ? ”
49623	49632	49605	49606	Mr Dombey	190	“ It is n’t cruel , is it ? ”
49633	49636	49638	49639	Mr Dombey	190	“ Cruel ! ”
49652	49663	49638	49639	Mr Dombey	190	“ No . A good thing ca n’t be cruel . ”
49664	49677	49679	49681	the little fellow	10286	“ If it ’s a good thing , and can do anything , ”
49693	49705	49686	49686	he	10286	“ I wonder why it did n’t save me my Mama . ”
50039	50057	50059	50059	Paul	220	“ It ca n’t make me strong and quite well , either , Papa ; can it ? ”
50071	50081	50083	50084	Mr Dombey	190	“ Why , you are strong and quite well , ”
50086	50091	50083	50084	Mr Dombey	190	“ Are you not ? ”
50120	50136	50138	50139	Mr Dombey	190	“ You are as strong and well as such little people usually are ? Eh ? ”
50141	50160	50138	50139	Mr Dombey	190	“ Florence is older than I am , but I ’m not as strong and well as Florence , “
50164	50169	50138	50139	Mr Dombey	190	” returned the child ; “
50202	50232	50196	50196	I	0	” said little Paul , warming his hands , and looking in between the bars of the grate , as if some ghostly puppet - show were performing there , “
50256	50257	50248	50248	I	0	” “
50266	50290	50248	50248	I	0	” said Mr Dombey , drawing his own chair closer to his son ’s , and laying his hand gently on his back ; “
50305	50306	50248	50248	I	0	” “
50317	50322	50315	50315	Papa	242	” returned the child , “
50357	50491	50492	50492	I	0	” And he went on , warming his hands again , and thinking about them , like an old man or a young goblin . Mr Dombey was so astonished , and so uncomfortable , and so perfectly at a loss how to pursue the conversation , that he could only sit looking at his son by the light of the fire , with his hand resting on his back , as if it were detained there by some magnetic attraction . Once he advanced his other hand , and turned the contemplative face towards his own for a moment . But it sought the fire again as soon as he released it ; and remained , addressed towards the flickering blaze , until the nurse appeared , to summon him to bed . “
50500	50504	50492	50492	I	0	” said Paul . “
50518	50527	50492	50492	I	0	” inquired that attendant , with great pathos . “
50534	50855	50530	50530	I	0	” replied Paul , composing himself in his arm - chair again , like the master of the house . Invoking a blessing upon his innocence , Mrs Wickam withdrew , and presently Florence appeared in her stead . The child immediately started up with sudden readiness and animation , and raised towards his father in bidding him good - night , a countenance so much brighter , so much younger , and so much more child - like altogether , that Mr Dombey , while he felt greatly reassured by the change , was quite amazed at it . After they had left the room together , he thought he heard a soft voice singing ; and remembering that Paul had said his sister sung to him , he had the curiosity to open the door and listen , and look after them . She was toiling up the great , wide , vacant staircase , with him in her arms ; his head was lying on her shoulder , one of his arms thrown negligently round her neck . So they went , toiling up ; she singing all the way , and Paul sometimes crooning out a feeble accompaniment . Mr Dombey looked after them until they reached the top of the staircase — not without halting to rest by the way — and passed out of his sight ; and then he still stood gazing upwards , until the dull rays of the moon , glimmering in a melancholy manner through the dim skylight , sent him back to his room . Mrs Chick and Miss Tox were convoked in council at dinner next day ; and when the cloth was removed , Mr Dombey opened the proceedings by requiring to be informed , without any gloss or reservation , whether there was anything the matter with Paul , and what Mr Pilkins said about him . “
50862	50867	50857	50858	the child	716	” said Mr Dombey , “
50875	50876	50877	50877	My	0	” “
50881	50886	50877	50877	My	0	” returned Mrs Chick , “
50918	50919	50915	50916	Miss Tox	208	” “
50924	50931	50915	50916	Miss Tox	208	” said Miss Tox , softly , “
50976	50995	50973	50974	the Bulbul	303	” Mr Dombey bent his head in stately recognition of the Bulbuls as an old - established body . “
51006	51011	51012	51012	you	192	” resumed Mrs Chick , “
51068	51077	51083	51083	His	1848	” said Mrs Chick , shaking her head ; “
51096	51097	51098	51098	I	0	” “
51102	51111	51086	51086	Lucretia	275	” said Mr Dombey , interrupting her testily , “
51139	51152	51125	51125	He	1848	” said Mr Dombey , laying an irritated stress upon the word . “
51181	51182	51178	51178	I	0	” “
51188	51197	51178	51178	I	0	” said Mrs Chick , with unspeakable expression . “
51202	51207	51178	51178	I	0	” returned her brother . “
51235	51236	51232	51232	I	0	” “
51242	51255	51232	51232	I	0	” interposed Mrs Chick , with the same profound expression as before . “
51265	51270	51272	51272	I	0	” said Mr Dombey . “
51291	51292	51295	51295	Paul	192	” “
51297	51308	51295	51295	Paul	192	” said Mrs Chick , after a moment ’s silence , “
51343	51344	51329	51334	a person of very cheerful spirit	1861	” “
51350	51356	51345	51348	A daughter of Momus	1862	” Miss Tox softly suggested . “
51360	51365	51345	51348	A daughter of Momus	1862	” said Mrs Chick ; “
51409	51410	51389	51389	I	0	” “
51431	51438	51429	51429	Louisa	204	” returned Mr Dombey , chafing , “
51446	51447	51448	51448	My	0	” “
51452	51462	51463	51463	I	0	” said Mrs Chick , in a warning voice , “
51478	51507	51508	51508	I	0	” at the same time a premonitory redness developed itself in Mrs Chick ’s eyelids which was an invariable sign of rain , unless the weather changed directly . “
51514	51530	51508	51508	I	0	” observed Mr Dombey , in an altered voice , and after a decent interval , “
51539	51540	51508	51508	I	0	” “
51546	51578	51508	51508	I	0	” said Mrs Chick , in the tone of one who was summing up what had been previously quite agreed upon , instead of saying it all for the first time , “
51629	51665	51693	51693	he	1870	” Mrs Chick was afraid to say limbs , after Mr Dombey ’s recent objection to bones , and therefore waited for a suggestion from Miss Tox , who , true to her office , hazarded “
51668	51669	51693	51693	he	1870	” “
51672	51677	51693	51693	he	1870	” repeated Mr Dombey . “
51696	51701	51693	51693	he	1870	” said Miss Tox . “
51712	51720	51706	51706	he	1870	” retorted Mrs Chick , mildly reproachful . “
51846	51851	51843	51844	Call Towlinson	272	” said Mrs Chick , “
51877	51878	51873	51873	Towlinson	272	” “
51886	51891	51880	51880	you	204	” observed Mr Dombey , “
51913	51914	51915	51915	I	0	” “
51924	51929	51922	51922	Paul	192	” said Mrs Chick ; “
52045	52046	52040	52040	He	1882	” “
52057	52062	52065	52065	he	202	” said Mr Dombey . “
52068	52073	52065	52065	he	202	” returned his sister . “
52156	52157	52150	52150	Paul	192	” “
52162	52172	52150	52150	Paul	192	” repeated Mr Dombey , looking at his sister . “
52185	52190	52191	52191	My	0	” said Mrs Chick . “
52332	52333	52327	52328	Mrs Pipchin	307	” “
52341	52360	52336	52337	Mrs Pipchin	307	” asked Mr Dombey ; aghast at this familiar introduction of a name he had never heard before . “
52368	52373	52361	52362	Mrs Pipchin	307	” returned his sister , “
52446	52456	52458	52459	Miss Tox	208	“ In pumping water out of the Peruvian Mines , ”
52461	52471	52473	52474	Mrs Chick	208	“ Not being a Pumper himself , of course , ”
52508	52552	52493	52494	Miss Tox	208	“ but having invested money in the speculation , which failed . I believe that Mrs Pipchin ’s management of children is quite astonishing . I have heard it commended in private circles ever since I was — dear me — how high ! ”
52577	52590	52592	52593	Miss Tox	208	“ Perhaps I should say of Mrs Pipchin , my dear Sir , ”
52600	52671	52592	52593	Miss Tox	208	“ having been so pointedly referred to , that the encomium which has been passed upon her by your sweet sister is well merited . Many ladies and gentleman , now grown up to be interesting members of society , have been indebted to her care . The humble individual who addresses you was once under her charge . I believe juvenile nobility itself is no stranger to her establishment . ”
52672	52687	52592	52593	Miss Tox	208	“ Do I understand that this respectable matron keeps an establishment , Miss Tox ? ”
52694	52703	52705	52706	that lady	9786	“ Why , I really do n’t know , ”
52708	52734	52736	52737	Miss Tox	208	“ whether I am justified in calling it so . It is not a Preparatory School by any means . Should I express my meaning , ”
52743	52759	52736	52737	Miss Tox	208	“ if I designated it an infantine Boarding - House of a very select description ? ”
52760	52769	52771	52772	Mrs Chick	208	“ On an exceedingly limited and particular scale , ”
52781	52787	52789	52790	Miss Tox	208	“ Oh ! Exclusion itself ! ”
52960	52989	52991	52992	Mr Dombey	190	“ Supposing we should decide , on to - morrow ’s inquiries , to send Paul down to Brighton to this lady , who would go with him ? ”
52998	53018	53020	53021	his sister	9777	“ I do n’t think you could send the child anywhere at present without Florence , my dear Paul , ”
53025	53047	53020	53021	his sister	9777	“ It ’s quite an infatuation with him . He ’s very young , you know , and has his fancies . ”
53073	53079	53080	53080	he	190	“ Anybody else , Louisa ? ”
53093	53109	53111	53112	his sister	9777	“ Wickam , of course . Wickam would be quite sufficient , I should say , ”
53114	53153	53080	53080	he	190	“ Paul being in such hands as Mrs Pipchin ’s , you could hardly send anybody who would be a further check upon her . You would go down yourself once a week at least , of course . ”
53154	53158	53160	53161	Mr Dombey	190	“ Of course , ”
53305	53309	53299	53299	She	307	“ a great manager ”
53784	53802	53777	53777	she	307	“ lady of remarkable firmness , who was quite scientific in her knowledge of the childish character . ”
54049	54054	54056	54057	Mrs Pipchin	307	“ Well , Sir , ”
54061	54071	54056	54057	Mrs Pipchin	307	“ how do you think you shall like me ? ”
54072	54084	54086	54086	Paul	192	“ I do n’t think I shall like you at all , ”
54088	54101	54056	54057	Mrs Pipchin	307	“ I want to go away . This is n’t my house . ”
54102	54109	54111	54112	Mrs Pipchin	307	“ No . It ’s mine , ”
54114	54122	54124	54124	Paul	192	“ It ’s a very nasty one , ”
54126	54138	54140	54141	Mrs Pipchin	307	“ There ’s a worse place in it than this though , ”
54143	54152	54140	54141	Mrs Pipchin	307	“ where we shut up our bad boys . ”
54153	54161	54163	54163	Paul	192	“ Has he ever been in it ? ”
54802	54808	54798	54799	Mrs Wickam	302	“ a smell of building ; ”
55448	55451	55453	55453	Paul	192	“ You , ”
55460	55469	55471	55472	Mrs Pipchin	307	“ And what are you thinking about me ? ”
55474	55484	55486	55486	Paul	192	“ I ’m thinking how old you must be , ”
55488	55501	55486	55486	Paul	192	“ You must n’t say such things as that , young gentleman , ”
55506	55512	55486	55486	Paul	192	“ That ’ll never do . ”
55513	55517	55519	55519	Paul	192	“ Why not ? ”
55521	55528	55530	55531	Mrs Pipchin	307	“ Because it ’s not polite , ”
55535	55539	55541	55541	Paul	192	“ Not polite ? ”
55543	55546	55541	55541	Paul	192	“ No . ”
55547	55553	55555	55555	Paul	192	“ It ’s not polite , ”
55559	55568	55555	55555	Paul	192	“ to eat all the mutton chops and toast ”
55573	55576	55570	55570	Wickam	302	“ Wickam , ”
55583	55595	55578	55579	Mrs Pipchin	307	“ is a wicked , impudent , bold - faced hussy . ”
55596	55601	55603	55603	Paul	192	“ What ’s that ? ”
55605	55612	55603	55603	Paul	192	“ Never you mind , Sir , ”
55617	55638	55614	55615	Mrs Pipchin	307	“ Remember the story of the little boy that was gored to death by a mad bull for asking questions . ”
55639	55646	55648	55648	Paul	192	“ If the bull was mad , ”
55650	55680	55648	55648	Paul	192	“ how did he know that the boy had asked questions ? Nobody can go and whisper secrets to a mad bull . I do n’t believe that story . ”
55681	55690	55692	55693	Mrs Pipchin	307	“ You do n’t believe it , Sir ? ”
55697	55700	55702	55702	Paul	192	“ No , ”
55704	55721	55723	55724	Mrs Pipchin	307	“ Not if it should happen to have been a tame bull , you little Infidel ? ”
56177	56179	56181	56182	Mrs Pipchin	307	“ young hussy”—that
56271	56283	56285	56285	Berry	302	“ What a pretty fellow he is when he ’s asleep ! ”
56306	56309	56311	56312	Mrs Wickam	302	“ Ah ! ”
56314	56319	56311	56312	Mrs Wickam	302	“ He need be . ”
56320	56332	56334	56334	Berry	302	“ Why , he ’s not ugly when he ’s awake , ”
56336	56354	56356	56357	Mrs Wickam	302	“ No , Ma’am . Oh , no . No more was my Uncle ’s Betsey Jane , ”
56384	56390	56363	56363	she	302	“ My Uncle ’s wife , ”
56398	56417	56391	56392	Mrs Wickam	302	“ died just like his Mama . My Uncle ’s child took on just as Master Paul do . ”
56418	56434	56436	56436	Berry	302	“ Took on ! You do n’t think he grieves for his Mama , sure ? ”
56447	56467	56436	56436	Berry	302	“ He ca n’t remember anything about her , you know , Mrs Wickam . It ’s not possible . ”
56468	56473	56475	56476	Mrs Wickam	302	“ No , Ma’am , ”
56477	56531	56436	56436	Berry	302	“ No more did my Uncle ’s child . But my Uncle ’s child said very strange things sometimes , and looked very strange , and went on very strange , and was very strange altogether . My Uncle ’s child made people ’s blood run cold , some times , she did ! ”
56532	56535	56537	56537	Berry	302	“ How ? ”
56539	56553	56555	56556	Mrs Wickam	302	“ I would n’t have sat up all night alone with Betsey Jane ! ”
56558	56617	56555	56556	Mrs Wickam	302	“ not if you ’d have put Wickam into business next morning for himself . I could n’t have done it , Miss Berry . Miss Berry naturally asked why not ? But Mrs Wickam , agreeably to the usage of some ladies in her condition , pursued her own branch of the subject , without any compunction . “
56621	56626	56618	56619	Betsey Jane	315	” said Mrs Wickam , “
56674	56679	56684	56684	yourself	2005	” said Mrs Wickam , “
56689	56697	56686	56687	Miss Berry	316	” Miss Berry involuntarily wrinkled her nose . “
56702	56723	56699	56700	Betsey Jane	315	” said Mrs Wickam , lowering her voice , and looking round the room , and towards Paul in bed , “
56777	56812	56774	56775	Miss Berry	316	” and Mrs Wickam , with a very white face , and with watery eyes , and with a tremulous voice , again looked fearfully round the room , and towards Paul in bed . “
56815	56826	56827	56827	You	316	” cried Miss Berry — somewhat resentful of the idea . “
56909	56910	56906	56906	you	316	” “
56916	56927	56913	56913	you	316	” said Berry , gently doing what she was asked , “
56939	56940	56941	56942	Betsey Jane	315	” “
56944	56954	56941	56942	Betsey Jane	315	” returned Mrs Wickam in her most solemn tones , “
57042	57043	57039	57040	Miss Berry	316	” “
57051	57055	57039	57040	Miss Berry	316	” asked Berry . “
57064	57085	57060	57060	she	2016	” returned Mrs Wickam with an air of triumph , for it was evident . Miss Berry expected the reverse ; “
57104	57134	57100	57100	SHE	2016	” said Mrs Wickam , laying strong stress on her nominative case . It being clear that somebody was dead , Mrs Pipchin ’s niece inquired who it was . “
57144	57153	57135	57135	I	0	” returned Mrs Wickam , pursuing her supper . “
57159	57207	57208	57208	She	2016	” This was the surest way of being asked again . Miss Berry repeated her question , therefore ; and after some resistance , and reluctance , Mrs Wickam laid down her knife , and again glancing round the room and at Paul in bed , replied : “
57240	57325	57236	57236	They	2023	” This was so very unexpected and awful to Mrs Pipchin ’s niece , that she sat upright on the hard edge of the bedstead , breathing short , and surveying her informant with looks of undisguised alarm . Mrs Wickam shook her left fore - finger stealthily towards the bed where Florence lay ; then turned it upside down , and made several emphatic points at the floor ; immediately below which was the parlour in which Mrs Pipchin habitually consumed the toast . “
57333	57338	57327	57327	my	0	” said Mrs Wickam , “
57391	57514	57515	57515	He	2027	” Miss Berry ’s emotion might have led to her patting Paul too hard on the back , or might have produced a cessation of that soothing monotony , but he turned in his bed just now , and , presently awaking , sat up in it with his hair hot and wet from the effects of some childish dream , and asked for Florence . She was out of her own bed at the first sound of his voice ; and bending over his pillow immediately , sang him to sleep again . Mrs Wickam shaking her head , and letting fall several tears , pointed out the little group to Berry , and turned her eyes up to the ceiling . “
57523	57531	57515	57515	He	2027	” said Mrs Wickam after a pause , “
57546	57547	57550	57550	nurse	2029	” “
57552	57558	57550	57550	nurse	2029	” said Florence , laughing . “
57563	57564	57550	57550	nurse	2029	” “
57567	57585	57550	57550	nurse	2029	” sighed Mrs Wickam , and she shook her head again , expressing to the watchful Berry , “
57600	57626	57631	57631	Miss	2031	” Berry took the frugal supper - tray , with which Mrs Wickam had by this time done , and bade her good - night . “
57633	57638	57631	57631	Miss	2031	” returned Wickam softly . “
57665	58047	57646	57648	an old lady	2033	” This consolatory farewell , Mrs Wickam accompanied with a look of heartfelt anguish ; and being left alone with the two children again , and becoming conscious that the wind was blowing mournfully , she indulged in melancholy — that cheapest and most accessible of luxuries — until she was overpowered by slumber . Although the niece of Mrs Pipchin did not expect to find that exemplary dragon prostrate on the hearth - rug when she went downstairs , she was relieved to find her unusually fractious and severe , and with every present appearance of intending to live a long time to be a comfort to all who knew her . Nor had she any symptoms of declining , in the course of the ensuing week , when the constitutional viands still continued to disappear in regular succession , notwithstanding that Paul studied her as attentively as ever , and occupied his usual seat between the black skirts and the fender , with unwavering constancy . But as Paul himself was no stronger at the expiration of that time than he had been on his first arrival , though he looked much healthier in the face , a little carriage was got for him , in which he could lie at his ease , with an alphabet and other elementary works of reference , and be wheeled down to the sea - side . Consistent in his odd tastes , the child set aside a ruddy - faced lad who was proposed as the drawer of this carriage , and selected , instead , his grandfather — a weazen , old , crab - faced man , in a suit of battered oilskin , who had got tough and stringy from long pickling in salt water , and who smelt like a weedy sea - beach when the tide is out . With this notable attendant to pull him along , and Florence always walking by his side , and the despondent Wickam bringing up the rear , he went down to the margin of the ocean every day ; and there he would sit or lie in his carriage for hours together : never so distressed as by the company of children — Florence alone excepted , always . “
58055	58069	57646	57648	an old lady	2033	” he would say to any child who came to bear him company . “
58080	58098	58074	58074	I	0	” Some small voice , near his ear , would ask him how he was , perhaps . “
58108	58113	58104	58104	I	0	” he would answer . “
58126	58145	58146	58146	We	2035	” Then he would turn his head , and watch the child away , and say to Florence , “
58161	58259	58260	58260	Floy	197	” He had even a dislike , at such times , to the company of Wickam , and was well pleased when she strolled away , as she generally did , to pick up shells and acquaintances . His favourite spot was quite a lonely one , far away from most loungers ; and with Florence sitting by his side at work , or reading to him , or talking to him , and the wind blowing on his face , and the water coming up among the wheels of his bed , he wanted nothing more . “
58262	58268	58260	58260	Floy	197	” he said one day , “
58280	58281	58260	58260	Floy	197	” “
58293	58304	58260	58260	Floy	197	” said Florence , raising her eyes from her work . “
58308	58312	58260	58260	Floy	197	” asked Paul . “
58325	58326	58260	58260	Floy	197	” “
58335	58346	58347	58347	I	0	” said Paul , after being silent for a minute , “
58360	58361	58354	58354	Mama	212	” “
58365	58369	58354	58354	Mama	212	” answered Florence . “
58399	58438	58397	58397	Floy	197	” She hurriedly put her work aside , and laid her head down on his pillow , caressing him . And so would she , she said , if he were there . He would be better soon . “
58449	58453	58454	58454	I	0	” he answered . “
58476	58519	58474	58474	Floy	197	” Another time , in the same place , he fell asleep , and slept quietly for a long time . Awaking suddenly , he listened , started up , and sat listening . Florence asked him what he thought he heard . “
58528	58538	58520	58520	I	0	” he answered , looking steadily in her face . “
58541	58553	58554	58554	She	2039	” Floy , what is it that it keeps on saying ? ”
58568	58573	58574	58574	he	0	“ Yes , yes , ”
58577	58599	58574	58574	he	0	“ But I know that they are always saying something . Always the same thing . What place is over there ? ”
58930	58934	58928	58932	a certain “ lovely Peg	10733	“ lovely Peg , ”
59375	59378	59367	59367	his	293	“ Young Graves ”
59872	59876	59878	59878	Walter	293	“ Uncle Sol , ”
59880	59911	59878	59878	Walter	293	“ I do n’t think you ’re well . You have n’t eaten any breakfast . I shall bring a doctor to you , if you go on like this . ”
59912	59925	59927	59928	Uncle Sol	250	“ He ca n’t give me what I want , my boy , ”
59930	59948	59927	59928	Uncle Sol	250	“ At least he is in good practice if he can — and then he would n’t . ”
59949	59958	59878	59878	Walter	293	“ What is it , Uncle ? Customers ? ”
59959	59962	59964	59964	Solomon	250	“ Ay , ”
59970	59975	59964	59964	Solomon	250	“ Customers would do . ”
59976	59982	59984	59984	Walter	293	“ Confound it , Uncle ! ”
60003	60074	60076	60076	Walter	293	“ when I see the people going up and down the street in shoals all day , and passing and re - passing the shop every minute , by scores , I feel half tempted to rush out , collar somebody , bring him in , and make him buy fifty pounds ’ worth of instruments for ready money . What are you looking in at the door for ? — ”
60109	60126	60127	60129	The old gentleman	2091	“ That ’s no use . I could do that . Come in and buy it ! ”
60142	60147	60149	60149	Walter	293	“ There he goes ! ”
60151	60168	60149	60149	Walter	293	“ That ’s the way with ’em all . But , Uncle — I say , Uncle Sol”—for
60183	60221	60169	60171	the old man	1205	“ Do n’t be cast down . Do n’t be out of spirits , Uncle . When orders do come , they ’ll come in such a crowd , you wo n’t be able to execute ’em . ”
60222	60237	60239	60240	Solomon Gills	248	“ I shall be past executing ’em , whenever they come , my boy , ”
60242	60258	60239	60240	Solomon Gills	248	“ They ’ll never come to this shop again , till I am out of t. ”
60259	60272	60274	60274	Walter	293	“ I say , Uncle ! You musn’t really , you know ! ”
60276	60280	60274	60274	Walter	293	“ Do n’t ! ”
60304	60319	60321	60321	Walter	293	“ There ’s nothing more than usual the matter ; is there , Uncle ? ”
60343	60362	60321	60321	Walter	293	“ Be open with me , Uncle , if there is , and tell me all about it . ”
60363	60370	60372	60373	Old Sol	295	“ No , no , no , ”
60375	60394	60395	60395	Walter	293	“ More than usual ? No , no . What should there be the matter more than usual ? ”
60405	60414	60415	60415	he	293	“ That ’s what I want to know , ”
60418	60449	60415	60415	he	293	“ and you ask me ! I ’ll tell you what , Uncle , when I see you like this , I am quite sorry that I live with you . ”
60457	60495	60450	60451	Old Sol	295	“ Yes . Though nobody ever was happier than I am and always have been with you , I am quite sorry that I live with you , when I see you with anything in your mind . ”
60496	60509	60511	60511	Solomon	295	“ I am a little dull at such times , I know , ”
60518	60526	60528	60528	Walter	293	“ What I mean , Uncle Sol , ”
60542	60741	60743	60743	Walter	293	“ is , that then I feel you ought to have , sitting here and pouring out the tea instead of me , a nice little dumpling of a wife , you know,—a comfortable , capital , cosy old lady , who was just a match for you , and knew how to manage you , and keep you in good heart . Here am I , as loving a nephew as ever was ( I am sure I ought to be ! ) but I am only a nephew , and I ca n’t be such a companion to you when you ’re low and out of sorts as she would have made herself , years ago , though I ’m sure I ’d give any money if I could cheer you up . And so I say , when I see you with anything on your mind , that I feel quite sorry you have n’t got somebody better about you than a blundering young rough - and - tough boy like me , who has got the will to console you , Uncle , but has n’t got the way — hasn’t got the way , ”
60758	60765	60767	60767	Solomon	295	“ Wally , my dear boy , ”
60769	60803	60767	60767	Solomon	295	“ if the cosy little old lady had taken her place in this parlour five and forty years ago , I never could have been fonder of her than I am of you . ”
60804	60812	60814	60814	Walter	293	“ I know that , Uncle Sol , ”
60816	60862	60814	60814	Walter	293	“ Lord bless you , I know that . But you would n’t have had the whole weight of any uncomfortable secrets if she had been with you , because she would have known how to relieve you of ’em , and I do n’t . ”
60863	60871	60873	60876	the Instrument - maker	1191	“ Yes , yes , you do , ”
60878	60890	60892	60892	Walter	293	“ Well then , what ’s the matter , Uncle Sol ? ”
60896	60904	60892	60892	Walter	293	“ Come ! What ’s the matter ? ”
60938	60953	60962	60962	Solomon	250	“ All I can say is , Uncle Sol , that if there is — ”
60954	60960	60962	60962	Solomon	250	“ But there is n’t , ”
60964	60968	60970	60970	Walter	293	“ Very well , ”
60972	61054	60970	60970	Walter	293	“ Then I ’ve no more to say ; and that ’s lucky , for my time ’s up for going to business . I shall look in by - and - by when I ’m out , to see how you get on , Uncle . And mind , Uncle ! I ’ll never believe you again , and never tell you anything more about Mr Carker the Junior , if I find out that you have been deceiving me ! ”
61592	61598	61600	61600	Walter	293	“ Well , Uncle Sol ! ”
61633	61639	61640	61640	Solomon	250	“ How are you now ? ”
61657	61664	61666	61666	Walter	293	“ Is there anything the matter ? ”
61675	61690	61672	61672	his	293	“ No , no . There ’s nothing the matter , said Mr Brogley . “
61702	61715	61672	61672	his	293	” Walter looked from the broker to his Uncle in mute amazement . “
61720	61725	61672	61672	his	293	” said Mr Brogley , “
61750	61751	61745	61745	I	0	” “
61755	61765	61745	61745	I	0	” cried Walter , looking round at the shop . “
61768	61795	61745	61745	I	0	” said Mr Brogley , in confidential assent , and nodding his head as if he would urge the advisability of their all being comfortable together . “
61839	61840	61841	61842	Uncle Sol	250	” “
61844	61848	61841	61842	Uncle Sol	250	” faltered Walter . “
61854	61859	61849	61849	Wally	293	” returned his uncle . “
61883	61926	61877	61879	an old man	10637	” Pushing up his spectacles again ( for they were useless any longer to conceal his emotion ) , he covered his face with his hand , and sobbed aloud , and his tears fell down upon his coffee - coloured waistcoat . “
61936	61954	61877	61879	an old man	10637	” exclaimed Walter , who really felt a thrill of terror in seeing the old man weep . “
61972	61973	61964	61965	Mr Brogley	318	” “
61985	61990	61977	61977	you	0	” said Mr Brogley , “
61996	61997	61977	61977	you	0	” “
62002	62010	61977	61977	you	0	” cried Walter , catching at anything . “
62077	62642	62650	62651	Captain Cuttle	250	” Saying this with great fervour , and disregarding the old man ’s broken remonstrances , Walter dashed out of the shop again as hard as he could go ; and , having hurried round to the office to excuse himself on the plea of his Uncle ’s sudden illness , set off , full speed , for Captain Cuttle ’s residence . Everything seemed altered as he ran along the streets . There were the usual entanglement and noise of carts , drays , omnibuses , waggons , and foot passengers , but the misfortune that had fallen on the wooden Midshipman made it strange and new . Houses and shops were different from what they used to be , and bore Mr Brogley ’s warrant on their fronts in large characters . The broker seemed to have got hold of the very churches ; for their spires rose into the sky with an unwonted air . Even the sky itself was changed , and had an execution in it plainly . Captain Cuttle lived on the brink of a little canal near the India Docks , where there was a swivel bridge which opened now and then to let some wandering monster of a ship come roaming up the street like a stranded leviathan . The gradual change from land to water , on the approach to Captain Cuttle ’s lodgings , was curious . It began with the erection of flagstaffs , as appurtenances to public - houses ; then came slop - sellers ’ shops , with Guernsey shirts , sou’wester hats , and canvas pantaloons , at once the tightest and the loosest of their order , hanging up outside . These were succeeded by anchor and chain - cable forges , where sledgehammers were dinging upon iron all day long . Then came rows of houses , with little vane - surmounted masts uprearing themselves from among the scarlet beans . Then , ditches . Then , pollard willows . Then , more ditches . Then , unaccountable patches of dirty water , hardly to be descried , for the ships that covered them . Then , the air was perfumed with chips ; and all other trades were swallowed up in mast , oar , and block - making , and boatbuilding . Then , the ground grew marshy and unsettled . Then , there was nothing to be smelt but rum and sugar . Then , Captain Cuttle ’s lodgings — at once a first floor and a top storey , in Brig Place — were close before you . The Captain was one of those timber - looking men , suits of oak as well as hearts , whom it is almost impossible for the liveliest imagination to separate from any part of their dress , however insignificant . Accordingly , when Walter knocked at the door , and the Captain instantly poked his head out of one of his little front windows , and hailed him , with the hard glared hat already on it , and the shirt - collar like a sail , and the wide suit of blue , all standing as usual , Walter was as fully persuaded that he was always in that state , as if the Captain had been a bird and those had been his feathers . “
62643	62648	62650	62651	Captain Cuttle	250	Wal”r , my lad ! ”
62653	62667	62650	62651	Captain Cuttle	250	“ Stand by and knock again . Hard ! It ’s washing day . ”
62682	62687	62689	62690	Captain Cuttle	250	“ Hard it is ! ”
62781	62791	62793	62793	Walter	293	“ Captain Cuttle ’s at home , I know , ”
62799	62803	62805	62807	the widow lady	2134	“ Is he ? ”
62809	62814	62805	62807	the widow lady	2134	“ In - deed ! ”
62815	62824	62826	62826	Walter	293	“ He has just been speaking to me , ”
62832	62836	62838	62840	the widow lady	2134	“ Has he ? ”
62842	62885	62838	62840	the widow lady	2134	“ Then p’raps you ’ll give him Mrs MacStinger ’s respects , and say that the next time he lowers himself and his lodgings by talking out of the winder she ’ll thank him to come down and open the door too . ”
62905	62911	62913	62913	Walter	293	“ I ’ll mention it , ”
62915	62929	62913	62913	Walter	293	“ if you ’ll have the goodness to let me in , Ma’am . ”
62962	62972	62974	62975	Mrs MacStinger	320	“ A boy that can knock my door down , ”
62979	62989	62974	62975	Mrs MacStinger	320	“ can get over that , I should hope ! ”
63031	63034	63006	63007	Mrs MacStinger	320	“ raff . ”
63092	63099	63084	63085	that gentleman	9781	“ Never owed her a penny , Wal”r
63101	63121	63084	63085	that gentleman	9781	” said Captain Cuttle , in a low voice , and with visible marks of trepidation on his countenance . “
63143	63144	63145	63145	I	0	” “
63153	63157	63150	63151	Captain Cuttle	250	” said Walter . “
63162	63164	63166	63167	the Captain	10100	Wal”r , ”
63169	63187	63188	63189	The Captain	10100	“ She ’d find me out , wherever I went . Sit down . How ’s Gills ? ”
63301	63306	63308	63309	the Captain	10100	“ How ’s Gills ? ”
63348	63354	63364	63365	the Captain	10100	“ Oh , Captain Cuttle ! ”
63673	63674	63663	63663	He	250	“ Wal”r
63676	63686	63663	63663	He	250	” said the Captain , with a timid wink , “
63725	63888	63889	63889	Uncle	2156	“ till you see me . These directions were not issued without a previous knowledge of the enemy ’s tactics , for when Walter got downstairs , Mrs MacStinger glided out of the little back kitchen , like an avenging spirit . But not gliding out upon the Captain , as she had expected , she merely made a further allusion to the knocker , and glided in again . Some five minutes elapsed before Captain Cuttle could summon courage to attempt his escape ; for Walter waited so long at the street corner , looking back at the house , before there were any symptoms of the hard glazed hat . At length the Captain burst out of the door with the suddenness of an explosion , and coming towards him at a great pace , and never once looking over his shoulder , pretended , as soon as they were well out of the street , to whistle a tune . “
63894	63896	63898	63899	the Captain	10100	Wal”r ? ”
63907	63928	63898	63899	the Captain	10100	“ I am afraid so . If you had seen him this morning , you would never have forgotten it . ”
63929	63933	63898	63899	the Captain	10100	“ Walk fast , Wal”r
63938	63947	63898	63899	the Captain	10100	” returned the Captain , mending his pace ; “
63970	64057	64058	64058	Gills	248	” The Captain was too busy with his own thoughts of Solomon Gills , mingled perhaps with some reflections on his late escape from Mrs MacStinger , to offer any further quotations on the way for Walter ’s moral improvement They interchanged no other word until they arrived at old Sol ’s door , where the unfortunate wooden Midshipman , with his instrument at his eye , seemed to be surveying the whole horizon in search of some friend to help him out of his difficulty . “
64060	64080	64058	64058	Gills	248	” said the Captain , hurrying into the back parlour , and taking him by the hand quite tenderly . “
64103	64132	64097	64097	you	248	” said the Captain , with the solemnity of a man who was delivering himself of one of the most precious practical tenets ever discovered by human wisdom , “
64150	64218	64223	64223	you	248	” Old Sol returned the pressure of his hand , and thanked him . Captain Cuttle , then , with a gravity suitable to the nature of the occasion , put down upon the table the two tea - spoons and the sugar - tongs , the silver watch , and the ready money ; and asked Mr Brogley , the broker , what the damage was . “
64228	64233	64223	64223	you	248	” said Captain Cuttle . “
64240	64245	64236	64236	Lord	2161	” returned the broker ; “
64260	64261	64258	64258	you	248	” “
64265	64270	64258	64258	you	248	” inquired the Captain . “
64283	64288	64236	64236	Lord	2161	” replied the broker . “
64292	64306	64236	64236	Lord	2161	” returned the Captain , though he was evidently dismayed by the figures : “
64319	64320	64316	64316	I	0	” “
64323	64328	64316	64316	I	0	” said Mr Brogley . “
64338	64376	64377	64377	Gills	248	” The philosophy of this observation seemed to strike the Captain . He ruminated for a minute ; eyeing the broker , meanwhile , as a deep genius ; and then called the Instrument - maker aside . “
64379	64384	64377	64377	Gills	248	” said Captain Cuttle , “
64398	64399	64400	64400	Hush	323	” “
64402	64408	64400	64400	Hush	323	” returned the old man . “
64484	64485	64477	64477	Wally	293	” “
64496	64504	64494	64494	you	263	” whispered the Captain . [ Illustration ] “
64516	64552	64512	64512	I’ve	2165	” returned old Sol , first putting his hands into his empty pockets , and then squeezing his Welsh wig between them , as if he thought he might wring some gold out of it ; “
64618	64698	64699	64699	I	0	” said the old man , looking in bewilderment about him . He had so much the air of a half - witted person who had been hiding his money in a variety of places , and had forgotten where , that the Captain followed his eyes , not without a faint hope that he might remember some few hundred pounds concealed up the chimney , or down in the cellar . But Solomon Gills knew better than that . “
64710	64718	64699	64699	I	0	” said Sol , in resigned despair , “
64795	64808	64786	64786	’em	2167	” said the old man , pointing feebly to the wooden Midshipman , “
64818	64819	64786	64786	’em	2167	” “
64827	64829	64831	64832	the Captain	10100	Wal”r ? ”
64834	64894	64896	64897	the Captain	10100	“ There , there ! Sit ye down , Gills , sit ye down , and let me think o ’ this . If I warn’t a man on a small annuity , that was large enough till today , I had n’t need to think of it . But you only lay your head well to the wind , ”
64907	64914	64896	64897	the Captain	10100	“ and you ’re all right ! ”
65072	65073	65091	65091	you	0	“ Wal”r
65075	65082	65091	65091	you	0	” said the Captain at last . “
65088	65089	65091	65091	you	0	” “
65096	65104	65093	65094	Captain Cuttle	250	” cried Walter , with great animation . “
65112	65117	65109	65110	my lad	1268	” said the Captain . “
65137	65138	65131	65132	the man	9864	” “
65142	65151	65139	65140	Mr Dombey	190	” faltered Walter . The Captain nodded gravely . “
65156	65160	65139	65140	Mr Dombey	190	” he said . “
65202	65203	65204	65206	A stone!—Mr Dombey	2180	” “
65208	65212	65204	65206	A stone!—Mr Dombey	2180	” faltered Walter . “
65231	65242	65213	65213	You	1268	” said Captain Cuttle , clapping him on the back . “
65245	65304	65305	65305	I	0	” Walter felt he must not dispute the command — a glance at his Uncle would have determined him if he had felt otherwise — and disappeared to execute it . He soon returned , out of breath , to say that Mr Dombey was not there . It was Saturday , and he had gone to Brighton . “
65310	65312	65314	65315	the Captain	10100	Wal”r ! ”
65330	65350	65314	65315	the Captain	10100	“ We ’ll go to Brighton . I ’ll back you , my boy . I ’ll back you , Wal”r
65363	65715	65352	65352	We	2184	” If the application must be made to Mr Dombey at all , which was awful to think of , Walter felt that he would rather prefer it alone and unassisted , than backed by the personal influence of Captain Cuttle , to which he hardly thought Mr Dombey would attach much weight . But as the Captain appeared to be of quite another opinion , and was bent upon it , and as his friendship was too zealous and serious to be trifled with by one so much younger than himself , he forbore to hint the least objection . Cuttle , therefore , taking a hurried leave of Solomon Gills , and returning the ready money , the teaspoons , the sugar - tongs , and the silver watch , to his pocket — with a view , as Walter thought , with horror , to making a gorgeous impression on Mr Dombey — bore him off to the coach - office , without a minute ’s delay , and repeatedly assured him , on the road , that he would stick by him to the last . CHAPTER X. Containing the Sequel of the Midshipman ’s Disaster Major Bagstock , after long and frequent observation of Paul , across Princess ’s Place , through his double - barrelled opera - glass ; and after receiving many minute reports , daily , weekly , and monthly , on that subject , from the native who kept himself in constant communication with Miss Tox ’s maid for that purpose ; came to the conclusion that Dombey , Sir , was a man to be known , and that J. B. was the boy to make his acquaintance . Miss Tox , however , maintaining her reserved behaviour , and frigidly declining to understand the Major whenever he called ( which he often did ) on any little fishing excursion connected with this project , the Major , in spite of his constitutional toughness and slyness , was fain to leave the accomplishment of his desire in some measure to chance , “
65718	65731	65352	65352	We	2184	” as he was used to observe with chuckles at his club , “
65759	66010	65752	65753	Yellow Jack	325	” It was some time coming to his aid in the present instance , but it befriended him at last . When the dark servant , with full particulars , reported Miss Tox absent on Brighton service , the Major was suddenly touched with affectionate reminiscences of his friend Bill Bitherstone of Bengal , who had written to ask him , if he ever went that way , to bestow a call upon his only son . But when the same dark servant reported Paul at Mrs Pipchin ’s , and the Major , referring to the letter favoured by Master Bitherstone on his arrival in England — to which he had never had the least idea of paying any attention — saw the opening that presented itself , he was made so rabid by the gout , with which he happened to be then laid up , that he threw a footstool at the dark servant in return for his intelligence , and swore he would be the death of the rascal before he had done with him : which the dark servant was more than half disposed to believe . At length the Major being released from his fit , went one Saturday growling down to Brighton , with the native behind him ; apostrophizing Miss Tox all the way , and gloating over the prospect of carrying by storm the distinguished friend to whom she attached so much mystery , and for whom she had deserted him . “
66019	66038	66017	66017	you	2187	” said the Major , straining with vindictiveness , and swelling every already swollen vein in his head . “
66122	66343	66104	66104	Ma’am	219	” And very tough indeed Master Bitherstone found him , when he took that young gentleman out for a walk . But the Major , with his complexion like a Stilton cheese , and his eyes like a prawn ’s , went roving about , perfectly indifferent to Master Bitherstone ’s amusement , and dragging Master Bitherstone along , while he looked about him high and low , for Mr Dombey and his children . In good time the Major , previously instructed by Mrs Pipchin , spied out Paul and Florence , and bore down upon them ; there being a stately gentleman ( Mr Dombey , doubtless ) in their company . Charging with Master Bitherstone into the very heart of the little squadron , it fell out , of course , that Master Bitherstone spoke to his fellow - sufferers . Upon that the Major stopped to notice and admire them ; remembered with amazement that he had seen and spoken to them at his friend Miss Tox ’s in Princess ’s Place ; opined that Paul was a devilish fine fellow , and his own little friend ; inquired if he remembered Joey B. the Major ; and finally , with a sudden recollection of the conventionalities of life , turned and apologised to Mr Dombey . “
66352	66357	66350	66350	Sir	735	” said the Major , “
66385	66393	66394	66394	Damme	326	” Here the Major lifted his hat . “
66398	66406	66396	66396	Sir	735	” cried the Major with sudden warmth , “
66411	66420	66409	66409	you	735	” Then he recollected himself , and added , “
66425	66435	66409	66409	you	735	” Mr Dombey begged he would n’t mention it . “
66442	66447	66409	66409	you	735	” said the Major , “
66498	66499	66492	66493	Mr Dombey	190	” “
66512	66517	66510	66510	Major	298	” returned Mr Dombey . “
66524	66529	66522	66522	Sir	735	” said the Major , “
66543	66573	66541	66541	Sir	735	” said the Major firmly , as if he defied Mr Dombey to contradict him , and would feel it his painful duty to bully him if he did , “
66670	66677	66661	66662	the Lord	2214	” said the Major , solemnly . “
66694	66699	66692	66692	Major	298	” returned Mr Dombey . “
66704	66760	66702	66702	Sir	735	” said the Major , in a severe tone . No , Mr Dombey , let us understand each other . That is not the Bagstock vein , Sir . You do n’t know Joseph B. He is a blunt old blade is Josh . No flattery in him , Sir . Nothing like it . ”
66785	66793	66795	66796	the Major	1679	“ My little friend here , Sir , ”
66808	66844	66846	66847	the Major	1679	“ will certify for Joseph Bagstock that he is a thorough - going , down - right , plain - spoken , old Trump , Sir , and nothing more . That boy , Sir , ”
66853	66878	66846	66847	the Major	1679	“ will live in history . That boy , Sir , is not a common production . Take care of him , Mr Dombey . ”
66892	66901	66903	66904	the Major	1679	“ Here is a boy here , Sir , ”
66917	66980	66903	66904	the Major	1679	“ Son of Bitherstone of Bengal . Bill Bitherstone formerly of ours . That boy ’s father and myself , Sir , were sworn friends . Wherever you went , Sir , you heard of nothing but Bill Bitherstone and Joe Bagstock . Am I blind to that boy ’s defects ? By no means . He ’s a fool , Sir . ”
67012	67015	66992	66992	he	190	“ Really ? ”
67016	67025	67027	67028	the Major	1679	“ That is what he is , sir , ”
67030	67061	67027	67028	the Major	1679	“ He ’s a fool . Joe Bagstock never minces matters . The son of my old friend Bill Bitherstone , of Bengal , is a born fool , Sir . ”
67072	67089	67091	67092	the Major	1679	“ My little friend is destined for a public school , I presume , Mr Dombey ? ”
67098	67105	67091	67092	the Major	1679	“ I am not quite decided , ”
67110	67119	67107	67108	Mr Dombey	190	“ I think not . He is delicate . ”
67120	67128	67130	67131	the Major	1679	“ If he ’s delicate , Sir , ”
67133	67217	67130	67131	the Major	1679	“ you are right . None but the tough fellows could live through it , Sir , at Sandhurst . We put each other to the torture there , Sir . We roasted the new fellows at a slow fire , and hung ’em out of a three pair of stairs window , with their heads downwards . Joseph Bagstock , Sir , was held out of the window by the heels of his boots , for thirteen minutes by the college clock . ”
67246	67257	67259	67260	the Major	1679	“ But it made us what we were , Sir , ”
67267	67287	67259	67260	the Major	1679	“ We were iron , Sir , and it forged us . Are you remaining here , Mr Dombey ? ”
67288	67299	67301	67302	that gentleman	9781	“ I generally come down once a week , Major , ”
67304	67311	67301	67302	that gentleman	9781	“ I stay at the Bedford . ”
67312	67332	67334	67335	the Major	1679	“ I shall have the honour of calling at the Bedford , Sir , if you ’ll permit me , ”
67337	67379	67334	67335	the Major	1679	“ Joey B. , Sir , is not in general a calling man , but Mr Dombey ’s is not a common name . I am much indebted to my little friend , Sir , for the honour of this introduction . ”
67414	67427	67429	67430	the Major	1679	long—“and the oldsters too , Sir , if you come to that , ”
67646	67651	67653	67654	Miss Tox	208	“ My dearest Louisa , ”
67673	67699	67653	67654	Miss Tox	208	“ if I should seem at all reserved to Major Bagstock , or under any constraint with him , promise me not to notice it . ”
67700	67705	67653	67654	Miss Tox	208	“ My dear Lucretia , ”
67710	67726	67653	67654	Miss Tox	208	“ what mystery is involved in this remarkable request ? I must insist upon knowing . ”
67727	67741	67743	67744	Miss Tox	208	“ Since you are resolved to extort a confession from me , Louisa , ”
67747	67764	67743	67744	Miss Tox	208	“ I have no alternative but to confide to you that the Major has been particular . ”
67765	67768	67770	67771	Mrs Chick	208	“ Particular ! ”
67773	67790	67792	67793	Miss Tox	208	“ The Major has long been very particular indeed , my love , in his attentions , ”
67795	67815	67792	67793	Miss Tox	208	“ occasionally they have been so very marked , that my position has been one of no common difficulty . ”
67816	67823	67825	67826	Mrs Chick	208	“ Is he in good circumstances ? ”
67828	67846	67848	67849	Miss Tox	208	“ I have every reason to believe , my dear — indeed I may say I know , ”
67851	67932	67848	67849	Miss Tox	208	“ that he is wealthy . He is truly military , and full of anecdote . I have been informed that his valour , when he was in active service , knew no bounds . I am told that he did all sorts of things in the Peninsula , with every description of fire - arm ; and in the East and West Indies , my love , I really could n’t undertake to say what he did not do . ”
67933	67940	67942	67943	Mrs Chick	208	“ Very creditable to him indeed , ”
67945	67960	67942	67943	Mrs Chick	208	“ extremely so ; and you have given him no encouragement , my dear ? ”
67961	67970	67972	67973	Miss Tox	208	“ If I were to say , Louisa , ”
67987	68082	68084	68085	Miss Tox—“but	10970	“ that I never encouraged Major Bagstock slightly , I should not do justice to the friendship which exists between you and me . It is , perhaps , hardly in the nature of woman to receive such attentions as the Major once lavished upon myself without betraying some sense of obligation . But that is past — long past . Between the Major and me there is now a yawning chasm , and I will not feign to give encouragement , Louisa , where I can not give my heart . My affections , ”
68085	68093	68084	68085	Miss Tox—“but	10970	Tox—“but , Louisa , this is madness ! ”
68171	68181	68187	68187	he	1679	“ Your family monopolises Joe ’s light , Sir , ”
68193	68226	68187	68187	he	1679	“ Joe lives in darkness . Princess ’s Place is changed into Kamschatka in the winter time . There is no ray of sun , Sir , for Joey B. , now . ”
68227	68245	68247	68248	Mr Dombey	190	“ Miss Tox is good enough to take a great deal of interest in Paul , Major , ”
68256	68260	68262	68263	the Major	1679	“ Damme Sir , ”
68265	68293	68262	68263	the Major	1679	“ I ’m jealous of my little friend . I ’m pining away Sir . The Bagstock breed is degenerating in the forsaken person of old Joe . ”
68619	68635	68617	68617	himself	1679	“ Sly , Sir — sly , Sir — de - vil - ish sly ! ”
68769	68806	68745	68745	he	1679	“ Would you , Ma’am , would you ? Mrs Dombey , eh , Ma’am ? I think not , Ma’am . Not while Joe B. can put a spoke in your wheel , Ma’am . J. B.“s
68856	68966	68967	68967	Papa	242	” There was no doubt of this last assertion being true , and to a very fearful extent ; as it continued to be during the greater part of that night , which the Major chiefly passed in similar exclamations , diversified with fits of coughing and choking that startled the whole house . It was on the day after this occasion ( being Sunday ) when , as Mr Dombey , Mrs Chick , and Miss Tox were sitting at breakfast , still eulogising the Major , Florence came running in : her face suffused with a bright colour , and her eyes sparkling joyfully : and cried , “
68982	68983	68976	68976	he	293	” “
68986	68991	68994	68994	she	2270	” cried Mr Dombey . “
69001	69002	69003	69003	Walter	293	” “
69007	69023	69003	69003	Walter	293	” said Florence timidly ; sensible of having approached the presence with too much familiarity . “
69032	69033	69003	69003	Walter	293	” “
69042	69051	69035	69035	she	2270	” inquired Mr Dombey , knitting his brows . “
69081	69144	69079	69079	you	0	” Mrs Chick hurried into the passage , and returned with the information that it was young Gay , accompanied by a very strange - looking person ; and that young Gay said he would not take the liberty of coming in , hearing Mr Dombey was at breakfast , but would wait until Mr Dombey should signify that he might approach . “
69153	69158	69146	69147	the boy	10021	” said Mr Dombey . “
69181	69182	69183	69183	I	0	” “
69190	69194	69188	69188	Sir	735	” returned Walter . “
69261	69266	69268	69269	Mr Dombey	190	“ What ’s that ? ”
69271	69289	69268	69269	Mr Dombey	190	“ Who is that ? I think you have made some mistake in the door , Sir . ”
69290	69304	69306	69306	Walter	293	“ Oh , I ’m very sorry to intrude with anyone , Sir , ”
69310	69322	69306	69306	Walter	293	“ but this is — this is Captain Cuttle , Sir . ”
69323	69324	69326	69327	my lad	1268	“ Wal”r
69329	69338	69268	69269	Mr Dombey	190	” observed the Captain in a deep voice : “
69342	69471	69474	69474	Gay	264	” At the same time the Captain , coming a little further in , brought out his wide suit of blue , his conspicuous shirt - collar , and his knobby nose in full relief , and stood bowing to Mr Dombey , and waving his hook politely to the ladies , with the hard glazed hat in his one hand , and a red equator round his head which it had newly imprinted there . Mr Dombey regarded this phenomenon with amazement and indignation , and seemed by his looks to appeal to Mrs Chick and Miss Tox against it . Little Paul , who had come in after Florence , backed towards Miss Tox as the Captain waved his hook , and stood on the defensive . “
69476	69481	69474	69474	Gay	264	” said Mr Dombey . “
69491	69513	69484	69484	you	264	” Again the Captain observed , as a general opening of the conversation that could not fail to propitiate all parties , “
69514	69518	69474	69474	Gay	264	Wal”r , standby ! ”
69519	69526	69528	69528	Walter	293	“ I am afraid , Sir , ”
69539	69592	69528	69528	Walter	293	“ that I take a very great liberty in coming — indeed , I am sure I do . I should hardly have had the courage to ask to see you , Sir , even after coming down , I am afraid , if I had not overtaken Miss Dombey , and — ”
69593	69596	69598	69599	Mr Dombey	190	“ Well ! ”
69623	69631	69616	69616	she	197	“ Go on , if you please . ”
69632	69637	69639	69640	the Captain	10100	“ Ay , ay , ”
69660	69667	69616	69616	she	197	“ Well said ! Go on , Wal”r
69669	69738	69616	69616	she	197	” Captain Cuttle ought to have been withered by the look which Mr Dombey bestowed upon him in acknowledgment of his patronage . But quite innocent of this , he closed one eye in reply , and gave Mr Dombey to understand , by certain significant motions of his hook , that Walter was a little bashful at first , and might be expected to come out shortly . “
69756	69762	69754	69754	Sir	735	” continued Walter , faltering , “
69767	69768	69764	69765	Captain Cuttle	250	” “
69771	69791	69764	69765	Captain Cuttle	250	” interposed the Captain , as an assurance that he was at hand , and might be relied upon . “
69812	69830	69810	69810	Sir	735	” pursued Walter , raising his eyes with a look of entreaty in the Captain ’s behalf , “
69848	69849	69810	69810	Sir	735	” “
69856	69862	69810	69810	Sir	735	” observed the Captain complacently . “
69875	69877	69886	69886	Walter	293	Wal”r . ”
69878	69884	69886	69886	Walter	293	“ And therefore , Sir , ”
69917	70051	70052	70052	Walter	293	“ therefore I have come , with him , Sir , to say that my poor old Uncle is in very great affliction and distress . That , through the gradual loss of his business , and not being able to make a payment , the apprehension of which has weighed very heavily upon his mind , months and months , as indeed I know , Sir , he has an execution in his house , and is in danger of losing all he has , and breaking his heart . And that if you would , in your kindness , and in your old knowledge of him as a respectable man , do anything to help him out of his difficulty , Sir , we never could thank you enough for it . ”
70084	70094	70096	70096	Walter	293	“ It is a very large sum , Sir , ”
70098	70159	70161	70161	Walter	293	“ More than three hundred pounds . My Uncle is quite beaten down by his misfortune , it lies so heavy on him ; and is quite unable to do anything for his own relief . He does n’t even know yet , that I have come to speak to you . You would wish me to say , Sir , ”
70169	70230	70232	70232	Walter	293	“ exactly what it is I want . I really do n’t know , Sir . There is my Uncle ’s stock , on which I believe I may say , confidently , there are no other demands , and there is Captain Cuttle , who would wish to be security too . I — I hardly like to mention , ”
70234	70262	70232	70232	Walter	293	“ such earnings as mine ; but if you would allow them — accumulate — payment — advance — Uncle — frugal , honourable , old man . ”
70359	70426	70428	70429	the Captain	10100	“ Half a loaf ’s better than no bread , and the same remark holds good with crumbs . There ’s a few . Annuity of one hundred pound premium also ready to be made over . If there is a man chock full of science in the world , it ’s old Sol Gills . If there is a lad of promise — one flowing , ”
70438	70449	70428	70429	the Captain	10100	“ with milk and honey — it ’s his nevy ! ”
70591	70599	70601	70602	Mr Dombey	190	“ What was this debt contracted for ? ”
70607	70613	70601	70602	Mr Dombey	190	“ Who is the creditor ? ”
70614	70620	70622	70623	the Captain	10100	“ He do n’t know , ”
70633	70669	70626	70626	his	10100	“ I do . It came of helping a man that ’s dead now , and that ’s cost my friend Gills many a hundred pound already . More particulars in private , if agreeable . ”
70670	70683	70685	70686	Mr Dombey	190	“ People who have enough to do to hold their own way , ”
70705	70738	70740	70741	Mr Dombey	190	“ had better be content with their own obligations and difficulties , and not increase them by engaging for other men . It is an act of dishonesty and presumption , too , ”
70745	70762	70740	70741	Mr Dombey	190	“ great presumption ; for the wealthy could do no more . Paul , come here ! ”
70776	70783	70785	70786	Mr Dombey	190	“ If you had money now — ”
70788	70793	70785	70786	Mr Dombey	190	“ Look at me ! ”
70815	70822	70824	70825	Mr Dombey	190	“ If you had money now , ”
70827	70843	70824	70825	Mr Dombey	190	“ as much money as young Gay has talked about ; what would you do ? ”
70844	70852	70854	70854	Paul	192	“ Give it to his old Uncle , ”
70856	70866	70868	70869	Mr Dombey	190	“ Lend it to his old Uncle , eh ? ”
70871	70896	70868	70869	Mr Dombey	190	“ Well ! When you are old enough , you know , you will share my money , and we shall use it together . ”
70897	70902	70904	70904	Paul	192	“ Dombey and Son , ”
70915	70920	70922	70923	his father	9730	“ Dombey and Son , ”
70925	70949	70922	70923	his father	9730	“ Would you like to begin to be Dombey and Son , now , and lend this money to young Gay ’s Uncle ? ”
70950	70959	70961	70961	Paul	192	“ Oh ! if you please , Papa ! ”
70963	70969	70961	70961	Paul	192	“ and so would Florence . ”
70970	70973	70975	70976	Mr Dombey	190	“ Girls , ”
70978	70993	70975	70976	Mr Dombey	190	“ have nothing to do with Dombey and Son . Would you like it ? ”
70994	71001	70961	70961	Paul	192	“ Yes , Papa , yes ! ”
71002	71009	71011	71012	his father	9730	“ Then you shall do it , ”
71014	71021	71022	71022	he	190	“ And you see , Paul , ”
71029	71084	71026	71026	his	190	“ how powerful money is , and how anxious people are to get it . Young Gay comes all this way to beg for money , and you , who are so grand and great , having got it , are going to let him have it , as a great favour and obligation . ”
71228	71232	71233	71233	he	190	“ Give that , ”
71236	71306	71307	71307	Walter	293	“ the first thing to - morrow morning , to Mr Carker . He will immediately take care that one of my people releases your Uncle from his present position , by paying the amount at issue ; and that such arrangements are made for its repayment as may be consistent with your Uncle ’s circumstances . You will consider that this is done for you by Master Paul . ”
71347	71356	71357	71357	he	190	“ You will consider that it is done , ”
71360	71385	71357	71357	he	190	“ by Master Paul . I have explained that to him , and he understands it . I wish no more to be said . ”
71418	71423	71424	71424	she	208	“ My dear Sir , ”
71444	71481	71424	71424	she	208	“ I think you have overlooked something . Pardon me , Mr Dombey , I think , in the nobility of your character , and its exalted scope , you have omitted a matter of detail . ”
71482	71488	71490	71491	Mr Dombey	190	“ Indeed , Miss Tox ! ”
71493	71501	71490	71491	Mr Dombey	190	“ The gentleman with the — Instrument , ”
71511	71522	71503	71504	Miss Tox	208	“ has left upon the table , at your elbow — ”
71523	71527	71529	71530	Mr Dombey	190	“ Good Heaven ! ”
71549	71582	71529	71530	Mr Dombey	190	“ Take these things away . I am obliged to you , Miss Tox ; it is like your usual discretion . Have the goodness to take these things away , Sir ! ”
71780	71792	71794	71795	Mrs Chick	208	“ Will you never be a Dombey , my dear child ! ”
71801	71805	71807	71807	Florence	197	“ Dear aunt , ”
71809	71824	71807	71807	Florence	197	“ Do n’t be angry with me . I am so thankful to Papa ! ”
72228	72231	72217	72217	he	293	“ Lovely Peg ”
72248	72251	72262	72262	Peg	333	“ Florence ; ”
72358	72363	72365	72366	the Major	1679	“ Damme , Sir , ”
72368	72416	72365	72366	the Major	1679	“ he ’s a prince , is my friend Dombey in the City . I tell you what , Sir . If you had a few more men among you like old Joe Bagstock and my friend Dombey in the City , Sir , you ’d do ! ”
72577	72584	72536	72536	she	302	“ I hope , Miss Berry , ”
72590	72642	72536	72536	she	302	“ that you ’ll come into whatever little property there may be to leave . You deserve it , I am sure , for yours is a trying life . Though there do n’t seem much worth coming into — you’ll excuse my being so open — in this dismal den . ”
72984	72996	72997	72997	Paul	192	“ Berry ’s very fond of you , ai n’t she ? ”
73013	73016	73018	73019	Mrs Pipchin	307	“ Yes , ”
73021	73024	73026	73026	Paul	192	“ Why ? ”
73028	73031	73033	73036	the disconcerted old lady	2363	“ Why ! ”
73038	73057	73033	73036	the disconcerted old lady	2363	“ How can you ask such things , Sir ! why are you fond of your sister Florence ? ”
73058	73065	73067	73067	Paul	192	“ Because she ’s very good , ”
73069	73076	73067	73067	Paul	192	“ There ’s nobody like Florence . ”
73077	73080	73082	73083	Mrs Pipchin	307	“ Well ! ”
73087	73098	73082	73083	Mrs Pipchin	307	“ and there ’s nobody like me , I suppose . ”
73099	73106	73108	73108	Paul	192	“ Ai n’t there really though ? ”
73123	73126	73128	73130	the old lady	2335	“ No , ”
73132	73139	73141	73141	Paul	192	“ I am glad of that , ”
73148	73156	73141	73141	Paul	192	“ That ’s a very good thing . ”
73455	73459	73461	73462	Mr Dombey	190	“ Mrs Pipchin , ”
73464	73470	73461	73462	Mr Dombey	190	“ How do you do ? ”
73471	73477	73479	73480	Mrs Pipchin	307	“ Thank you , Sir , ”
73482	73490	73479	73480	Mrs Pipchin	307	“ I am pretty well , considering . ”
73513	73526	73528	73529	Mrs Pipchin	307	“ I ca n’t expect , Sir , to be very well , ”
73539	73552	73528	73529	Mrs Pipchin	307	“ but such health as I have , I am grateful for . ”
73595	73663	73589	73589	he	190	“ Mrs Pipchin , I have taken the liberty of calling , to consult you in reference to my son . I have had it in my mind to do so for some time past ; but have deferred it from time to time , in order that his health might be thoroughly re - established . You have no misgivings on that subject , Mrs Pipchin ? ”
73664	73673	73675	73676	Mrs Pipchin	307	“ Brighton has proved very beneficial , Sir , ”
73678	73684	73675	73676	Mrs Pipchin	307	“ Very beneficial , indeed . ”
73685	73689	73691	73692	Mr Dombey	190	“ I purpose , ”
73694	73700	73691	73692	Mr Dombey	190	“ his remaining at Brighton . ”
73716	73719	73709	73709	her	307	“ But , ”
73729	73779	73726	73726	his	190	“ but possibly that he should now make a change , and lead a different kind of life here . In short , Mrs Pipchin , that is the object of my visit . My son is getting on , Mrs Pipchin . Really , he is getting on . ”
73851	73856	73858	73859	Mr Dombey	190	“ Six years old ! ”
73901	73921	73937	73937	her	2382	“ Dear me , six will be changed to sixteen , before we have time to look about us . ”
73922	73926	73937	73937	her	2382	“ Ten years , ”
73951	73957	73947	73947	her	2382	“ is a long time . ”
73958	73968	73947	73947	her	2382	“ It depends on circumstances , returned Mr Dombey ; “
74009	74028	74029	74029	his	877	” said Mr Dombey , quickly answering what he mistrusted was a shrewd twinkle of the frosty eye , “
74133	74134	74130	74131	Mrs Pipchin	307	” “
74139	74144	74130	74131	Mrs Pipchin	307	” said Mrs Pipchin , “
74153	74154	74145	74145	I	0	” “
74163	74170	74155	74155	I	0	” returned Mr Dombey , approvingly , “
74185	74186	74160	74161	Mrs Pipchin	307	” “
74224	74235	74222	74222	Sir	735	” said Mrs Pipchin , impatiently rubbing her hooked nose . “
74266	74267	74268	74270	My good madam	2394	” “
74272	74277	74268	74270	My good madam	2394	” returned Mr Dombey , “
74323	74339	74354	74355	Mrs Pipchin	307	” Mr Dombey ’s loftiness when he affected to disparage his own importance , passed all bounds—“can
74357	74358	74354	74355	Mrs Pipchin	307	” “
74364	74369	74362	74362	Sir	735	” said Mrs Pipchin . “
74403	74404	74354	74355	Mrs Pipchin	307	” “
74411	74416	74354	74355	Mrs Pipchin	307	” added Mr Dombey . “
74425	74450	74423	74423	Sir	735	” returned Mrs Pipchin , catching at the fact , as if in omitting that , she had omitted one of its leading merits . “
74463	74479	74481	74481	he	9751	” said Mr Dombey , hitching his chair anxiously a little nearer to the fire , “
74563	74574	74560	74560	their	2405	” Mr Dombey said no more , but sat silent . “
74579	74600	74560	74560	their	2405	” exclaimed Mrs Pipchin , shaking out her black bombazeen skirts , and plucking up all the ogress within her . “
74619	74683	74684	74684	He	877	” The good lady apologised immediately afterwards for using so common a figure of speech , but said ( and truly ) that that was the way she reasoned with ’em . Mr Dombey waited until Mrs Pipchin had done bridling and shaking her head , and frowning down a legion of Bitherstones and Pankeys ; and then said quietly , but correctively , “
74692	75398	74690	74690	he	877	” Mrs Pipchin ’s system would have applied very much the same mode of cure to any uneasiness on the part of Paul , too ; but as the hard grey eye was sharp enough to see that the recipe , however Mr Dombey might admit its efficacy in the case of the daughter , was not a sovereign remedy for the son , she argued the point ; and contended that change , and new society , and the different form of life he would lead at Doctor Blimber ’s , and the studies he would have to master , would very soon prove sufficient alienations . As this chimed in with Mr Dombey ’s own hope and belief , it gave that gentleman a still higher opinion of Mrs Pipchin ’s understanding ; and as Mrs Pipchin , at the same time , bewailed the loss of her dear little friend ( which was not an overwhelming shock to her , as she had long expected it , and had not looked , in the beginning , for his remaining with her longer than three months ) , he formed an equally good opinion of Mrs Pipchin ’s disinterestedness . It was plain that he had given the subject anxious consideration , for he had formed a plan , which he announced to the ogress , of sending Paul to the Doctor ’s as a weekly boarder for the first half year , during which time Florence would remain at the Castle , that she might receive her brother there , on Saturdays . This would wean him by degrees , Mr Dombey said ; possibly with a recollection of his not having been weaned by degrees on a former occasion . Mr Dombey finished the interview by expressing his hope that Mrs Pipchin would still remain in office as general superintendent and overseer of his son , pending his studies at Brighton ; and having kissed Paul , and shaken hands with Florence , and beheld Master Bitherstone in his collar of state , and made Miss Pankey cry by patting her on the head ( in which region she was uncommonly tender , on account of a habit Mrs Pipchin had of sounding it with her knuckles , like a cask ) , he withdrew to his hotel and dinner : resolved that Paul , now that he was getting so old and well , should begin a vigorous course of education forthwith , to qualify him for the position in which he was to shine ; and that Doctor Blimber should take him in hand immediately . Whenever a young gentleman was taken in hand by Doctor Blimber , he might consider himself sure of a pretty tight squeeze . The Doctor only undertook the charge of ten young gentlemen , but he had , always ready , a supply of learning for a hundred , on the lowest estimate ; and it was at once the business and delight of his life to gorge the unhappy ten with it . In fact , Doctor Blimber ’s establishment was a great hot - house , in which there was a forcing apparatus incessantly at work . All the boys blew before their time . Mental green - peas were produced at Christmas , and intellectual asparagus all the year round . Mathematical gooseberries ( very sour ones too ) were common at untimely seasons , and from mere sprouts of bushes , under Doctor Blimber ’s cultivation . Every description of Greek and Latin vegetable was got off the driest twigs of boys , under the frostiest circumstances . Nature was of no consequence at all . No matter what a young gentleman was intended to bear , Doctor Blimber made him bear to pattern , somehow or other . This was all very pleasant and ingenious , but the system of forcing was attended with its usual disadvantages . There was not the right taste about the premature productions , and they did n’t keep well . Moreover , one young gentleman , with a swollen nose and an excessively large head ( the oldest of the ten who had “
75401	76489	76492	76492	Paul	192	” everything ) , suddenly left off blowing one day , and remained in the establishment a mere stalk . And people did say that the Doctor had rather overdone it with young Toots , and that when he began to have whiskers he left off having brains . There young Toots was , at any rate ; possessed of the gruffest of voices and the shrillest of minds ; sticking ornamental pins into his shirt , and keeping a ring in his waistcoat pocket to put on his little finger by stealth , when the pupils went out walking ; constantly falling in love by sight with nurserymaids , who had no idea of his existence ; and looking at the gas - lighted world over the little iron bars in the left - hand corner window of the front three pairs of stairs , after bed - time , like a greatly overgrown cherub who had sat up aloft much too long . The Doctor was a portly gentleman in a suit of black , with strings at his knees , and stockings below them . He had a bald head , highly polished ; a deep voice ; and a chin so very double , that it was a wonder how he ever managed to shave into the creases . He had likewise a pair of little eyes that were always half shut up , and a mouth that was always half expanded into a grin , as if he had , that moment , posed a boy , and were waiting to convict him from his own lips . Insomuch , that when the Doctor put his right hand into the breast of his coat , and with his other hand behind him , and a scarcely perceptible wag of his head , made the commonest observation to a nervous stranger , it was like a sentiment from the sphynx , and settled his business . The Doctor ’s was a mighty fine house , fronting the sea . Not a joyful style of house within , but quite the contrary . Sad - coloured curtains , whose proportions were spare and lean , hid themselves despondently behind the windows . The tables and chairs were put away in rows , like figures in a sum ; fires were so rarely lighted in the rooms of ceremony , that they felt like wells , and a visitor represented the bucket ; the dining - room seemed the last place in the world where any eating or drinking was likely to occur ; there was no sound through all the house but the ticking of a great clock in the hall , which made itself audible in the very garrets ; and sometimes a dull cooing of young gentlemen at their lessons , like the murmurings of an assemblage of melancholy pigeons . Miss Blimber , too , although a slim and graceful maid , did no soft violence to the gravity of the house . There was no light nonsense about Miss Blimber . She kept her hair short and crisp , and wore spectacles . She was dry and sandy with working in the graves of deceased languages . None of your live languages for Miss Blimber . They must be dead — stone dead — and then Miss Blimber dug them up like a Ghoul . Mrs Blimber , her Mama , was not learned herself , but she pretended to be , and that did quite as well . She said at evening parties , that if she could have known Cicero , she thought she could have died contented . It was the steady joy of her life to see the Doctor ’s young gentlemen go out walking , unlike all other young gentlemen , in the largest possible shirt - collars , and the stiffest possible cravats . It was so classical , she said . As to Mr Feeder , B.A. , Doctor Blimber ’s assistant , he was a kind of human barrel - organ , with a little list of tunes at which he was continually working , over and over again , without any variation . He might have been fitted up with a change of barrels , perhaps , in early life , if his destiny had been favourable ; but it had not been ; and he had only one , with which , in a monotonous round , it was his occupation to bewilder the young ideas of Doctor Blimber ’s young gentlemen . The young gentlemen were prematurely full of carking anxieties . They knew no rest from the pursuit of stony - hearted verbs , savage noun - substantives , inflexible syntactic passages , and ghosts of exercises that appeared to them in their dreams . Under the forcing system , a young gentleman usually took leave of his spirits in three weeks . He had all the cares of the world on his head in three months . He conceived bitter sentiments against his parents or guardians in four ; he was an old misanthrope , in five ; envied Curtius that blessed refuge in the earth , in six ; and at the end of the first twelvemonth had arrived at the conclusion , from which he never afterwards departed , that all the fancies of the poets , and lessons of the sages , were a mere collection of words and grammar , and had no other meaning in the world . But he went on blow , blow , blowing , in the Doctor ’s hothouse , all the time ; and the Doctor ’s glory and reputation were great , when he took his wintry growth home to his relations and friends . Upon the Doctor ’s door - steps one day , Paul stood with a fluttering heart , and with his small right hand in his father ’s . His other hand was locked in that of Florence . How tight the tiny pressure of that one ; and how loose and cold the other ! Mrs Pipchin hovered behind the victim , with her sable plumage and her hooked beak , like a bird of ill - omen . She was out of breath — for Mr Dombey , full of great thoughts , had walked fast — and she croaked hoarsely as she waited for the opening of the door . “
76494	76501	76492	76492	Paul	192	” said Mr Dombey , exultingly . “
76524	76525	76517	76517	You	192	” “
76528	76579	76517	76517	You	192	” returned the child . Even his childish agitation could not master the sly and quaint yet touching look , with which he accompanied the reply . It brought a vague expression of dissatisfaction into Mr Dombey ’s face ; but the door being opened , it was quickly gone . “
76589	76673	76580	76581	Doctor Blimber	336	” said Mr Dombey . The man said yes ; and as they passed in , looked at Paul as if he were a little mouse , and the house were a trap . He was a weak - eyed young man , with the first faint streaks or early dawn of a grin on his countenance . It was mere imbecility ; but Mrs Pipchin took it into her head that it was impudence , and made a snap at him directly . “
76684	76689	76676	76676	you	0	” said Mrs Pipchin . “
76698	76699	76693	76693	you	0	” “
76722	76731	76720	76720	Ma’am	219	” returned the young man , in consternation . “
76738	76743	76720	76720	Ma’am	219	” said Mrs Pipchin , “
76769	76801	76802	76802	You	0	” The weak - eyed young man went , very meekly , to discharge himself of this commission ; and soon came back to invite them to the Doctor ’s study . “
76809	76833	76807	76807	Sir	735	” said Mrs Pipchin , when it came to her turn , bringing up the rear , to pass him in the hall . “
76838	76847	76834	76834	I	0	” returned the young man , grievously oppressed . “
76857	76858	76864	76865	Mrs Pipchin	307	” “
76867	76875	76864	76865	Mrs Pipchin	307	” said Mr Dombey , looking round . “
76880	76902	76864	76865	Mrs Pipchin	307	” Mrs Pipchin , in her deference , merely muttered at the young man as she passed on , and said , “
76909	76992	76905	76905	he	2414	fellow”—leaving the young man , who was all meekness and incapacity , affected even to tears by the incident . But Mrs Pipchin had a way of falling foul of all meek people ; and her friends said who could wonder at it , after the Peruvian mines ! The Doctor was sitting in his portentous study , with a globe at each knee , books all round him , Homer over the door , and Minerva on the mantel - shelf . “
77001	77008	76996	76996	you	307	” he said to Mr Dombey , “
77016	77056	76996	76996	you	307	” Grave as an organ was the Doctor ’s speech ; and when he ceased , the great clock in the hall seemed ( to Paul at least ) to take him up , and to go on saying , “
77081	77169	76996	76996	you	307	” over and over and over again . The little friend being something too small to be seen at all from where the Doctor sat , over the books on his table , the Doctor made several futile attempts to get a view of him round the legs ; which Mr Dombey perceiving , relieved the Doctor from his embarrassment by taking Paul up in his arms , and sitting him on another little table , over against the Doctor , in the middle of the room . “
77172	77189	76996	76996	you	307	” said the Doctor , leaning back in his chair with his hand in his breast . “
77206	77252	77199	77199	you	2192	” The clock in the hall would n’t subscribe to this alteration in the form of words , but continued to repeat how , is , my , lit , tle , friend ? how , is , my , lit , tle , friend ? ”
77253	77263	77265	77265	Paul	192	“ Very well , I thank you , Sir , ”
77277	77280	77282	77283	Doctor Blimber	336	“ Ha ! ”
77285	77294	77282	77283	Doctor Blimber	336	“ Shall we make a man of him ? ”
77295	77302	77304	77305	Mr Dombey	190	“ Do you hear , Paul ? ”
77311	77320	77322	77323	the Doctor	9751	“ Shall we make a man of him ? ”
77325	77333	77335	77335	Paul	192	“ I had rather be a child , ”
77337	77340	77342	77343	the Doctor	9751	“ Indeed ! ”
77345	77348	77342	77343	the Doctor	9751	“ Why ? ”
77421	77426	77508	77508	his	9751	“ This is why , ”
77456	77460	77462	77463	his father	9730	“ Mrs Pipchin , ”
77470	77480	77462	77463	his father	9730	“ I am really very sorry to see this . ”
77481	77492	77494	77495	the matron	839	“ Come away from him , do , Miss Dombey , ”
77497	77501	77503	77504	the Doctor	9751	“ Never mind , ”
77517	77546	77513	77514	Mrs Pipchin	307	“ Never mind ; we shall substitute new cares and new impressions , Mr Dombey , very shortly . You would still wish my little friend to acquire — ”
77547	77556	77558	77559	Mr Dombey	190	“ Everything , if you please , Doctor , ”
77563	77566	77568	77569	the Doctor	9751	“ Yes , ”
77608	77653	77568	77569	the Doctor	9751	“ Yes , exactly . Ha ! We shall impart a great variety of information to our little friend , and bring him quickly forward , I daresay . I daresay . Quite a virgin soil , I believe you said , Mr Dombey ? ”
77654	77667	77669	77670	Mr Dombey	190	“ Except some ordinary preparation at home , and from this lady , ”
77700	77719	77720	77721	Doctor Blimber	336	“ except so far , Paul has , as yet , applied himself to no studies at all . ”
77791	77800	77768	77768	he	336	“ That circumstance , indeed , Doctor Blimber , ”
77811	77847	77802	77803	Mr Dombey	190	“ and the interview I have already had the pleasure of holding with you , renders any further explanation , and consequently , any further intrusion on your valuable time , so unnecessary , that — ”
77848	77854	77856	77858	the acid Pipchin	307	“ Now , Miss Dombey ! ”
77860	77864	77866	77867	the Doctor	9751	“ Permit me , ”
77869	77900	77866	77867	the Doctor	9751	“ one moment . Allow me to present Mrs Blimber and my daughter ; who will be associated with the domestic life of our young Pilgrim to Parnassus Mrs Blimber , ”
77926	77943	77945	77946	the Doctor	9751	“ Mr Dombey . My daughter Cornelia , Mr Dombey . Mr Dombey , my love , ”
77953	77967	77968	77969	Mrs Blimber	339	“ is so confiding as to — do you see our little friend ? ”
78044	78051	78053	78054	Mrs Blimber	339	“ Like a bee , Sir , ”
78060	78123	78053	78054	Mrs Blimber	339	“ about to plunge into a garden of the choicest flowers , and sip the sweets for the first time Virgil , Horace , Ovid , Terence , Plautus , Cicero . What a world of honey have we here . It may appear remarkable , Mr Dombey , in one who is a wife — the wife of such a husband — ”
78124	78129	78131	78132	Doctor Blimber	336	“ Hush , hush , ”
78134	78139	78131	78132	Doctor Blimber	336	“ Fie for shame . ”
78140	78151	78153	78154	Mrs Blimber	339	“ Mr Dombey will forgive the partiality of a wife , ”
78164	78169	78131	78132	Doctor Blimber	336	“ Not at all : ”
78190	78204	78206	78207	Mrs Blimber	339	“ And it may seem remarkable in one who is a mother also , ”
78209	78215	78217	78218	Mr Dombey	190	“ And such a mother , ”
78231	78235	78217	78218	Mr Dombey	190	“ But really , ”
78240	78280	78237	78238	Mrs Blimber	339	“ I think if I could have known Cicero , and been his friend , and talked with him in his retirement at Tusculum ( beau - ti - ful Tusculum ! ) , I could have died contented . ”
78420	78425	78427	78428	the Doctor	9751	“ Who is that ? ”
78430	78446	78427	78428	the Doctor	9751	“ Oh ! Come in , Toots ; come in . Mr Dombey , Sir . ”
78450	78455	78457	78458	Doctor Blimber	336	“ Quite a coincidence ! ”
78460	78481	78457	78458	Doctor Blimber	336	“ Here we have the beginning and the end . Alpha and Omega . Our head boy , Mr Dombey . ”
78522	78532	78534	78535	the Doctor	9751	“ An addition to our little Portico , Toots , ”
78537	78543	78534	78535	the Doctor	9751	“ Mr Dombey ’s son . ”
78571	78576	78560	78560	he	190	“ How are you ? ”
78603	78614	78616	78617	the Doctor	9751	“ Ask Mr Feeder , if you please , Toots , ”
78619	78655	78616	78617	the Doctor	9751	“ to prepare a few introductory volumes for Mr Dombey ’s son , and to allot him a convenient seat for study . My dear , I believe Mr Dombey has not seen the dormitories . ”
78656	78664	78666	78667	Mrs Blimber	339	“ If Mr Dombey will walk upstairs , ”
78669	78686	78666	78667	Mrs Blimber	339	“ I shall be more than proud to show him the dominions of the drowsy god . ”
78873	78885	78858	78858	his	9751	“ Do n’t tell me , Sir ; I know better , ”
78986	78993	78995	78996	the Doctor	9751	“ I hope , Mr Dombey , ”
79003	79011	78995	78996	the Doctor	9751	“ that the arrangements meet your approval . ”
79012	79019	79021	79022	Mr Dombey	190	“ They are excellent , Sir , ”
79024	79030	79032	79033	Mrs Pipchin	307	“ Very fair , indeed , ”
79048	79052	79054	79055	Mr Dombey	190	“ Mrs Pipchin , ”
79060	79078	79054	79055	Mr Dombey	190	“ will , with your permission , Doctor and Mrs Blimber , visit Paul now and then . ”
79079	79085	79087	79088	the Doctor	9751	“ Whenever Mrs Pipchin pleases , ”
79090	79097	79099	79100	Mrs Blimber	339	“ Always happy to see her , ”
79102	79106	79108	79109	Mr Dombey	190	“ I think , ”
79111	79132	79133	79133	he	190	“ I have given all the trouble I need , and may take my leave . Paul , my child , ”
79146	79151	79133	79133	he	190	“ Good - bye . ”
79152	79159	79133	79133	he	190	“ Good - bye , Papa . ”
79314	79334	79376	79377	Mr Dombey	190	“ I shall see you soon , Paul . You are free on Saturdays and Sundays , you know . ”
79335	79340	79342	79342	Paul	192	“ Yes , Papa , ”
79349	79355	79342	79342	Paul	192	“ On Saturdays and Sundays . ”
79356	79374	79376	79377	Mr Dombey	190	“ And you ’ll try and learn a great deal here , and be a clever man , ”
79379	79384	79376	79377	Mr Dombey	190	“ wo n’t you ? ”
79385	79390	79392	79393	the child	716	“ I ’ll try , ”
79397	79407	79409	79410	Mr Dombey	190	“ And you ’ll soon be grown up now ! ”
79412	79418	79420	79421	the child	716	“ Oh ! very soon ! ”
79702	79727	79681	79681	they	2481	“ how , is , my , lit , tle , friend ? how , is , my , lit , tle , friend ? ”
79753	79764	79749	79749	he	192	“ weary , weary ! very lonely , very sad ! ”
79929	79955	79925	79925	he	9751	“ Can anybody have the goodness to indicate any subject , in any direction , on which I am uninformed ? I rather think not . ”
79988	79991	79993	79994	the Doctor	9751	“ Cornelia , ”
79996	80015	79993	79994	the Doctor	9751	“ Dombey will be your charge at first . Bring him on , Cornelia , bring him on . ”
80044	80052	80054	80055	Miss Blimber	338	“ How old are you , Dombey ? ”
80057	80060	80062	80062	Paul	237	“ Six , ”
80095	80108	80110	80111	Miss Blimber	338	“ How much do you know of your Latin Grammar , Dombey ? ”
80113	80118	80120	80120	Paul	237	“ None of it , ”
80152	80202	80135	80135	he	237	“ I have n’t been well . I have been a weak child . I could n’t learn a Latin Grammar when I was out , every day , with old Glubb . I wish you ’d tell old Glubb to come and see me , if you please . ”
80203	80209	80211	80212	Mrs Blimber	339	“ What a dreadfully low name ”
80214	80227	80211	80212	Mrs Blimber	339	“ Unclassical to a degree ! Who is the monster , child ? ”
80228	80232	80234	80234	Paul	237	“ What monster ? ”
80236	80239	80241	80242	Mrs Blimber	339	“ Glubb , ”
80249	80260	80262	80262	Paul	237	“ He ’s no more a monster than you are , ”
80264	80267	80269	80270	the Doctor	9751	“ What ! ”
80277	80290	80269	80270	the Doctor	9751	“ Ay , ay , ay ? Aha ! What ’s that ? ”
80313	80324	80325	80325	he	237	“ He ’s a very nice old man , Ma’am , ”
80328	80403	80325	80325	he	237	“ He used to draw my couch . He knows all about the deep sea , and the fish that are in it , and the great monsters that come and lie on rocks in the sun , and dive into the water again when they ’re startled , blowing and splashing so , that they can be heard for miles . There are some creatures , said Paul , warming with his subject , “
80460	80474	80454	80454	he	868	” said Paul , boldly tendering this information to the very Doctor himself , “
80557	80589	80554	80554	I	0	” the child concluded , with a sudden falling of his countenance , and failing in his animation , as he looked like one forlorn , upon the three strange faces , “
80614	80615	80610	80610	he	351	” “
80618	80627	80610	80610	he	351	” said the Doctor , shaking his head ; “
80638	80679	80610	80610	he	351	” Mrs Blimber opined , with something like a shiver , that he was an unaccountable child ; and , allowing for the difference of visage , looked at him pretty much as Mrs Pipchin had been used to do . “
80688	80693	80686	80686	Cornelia	345	” said the Doctor , “
80710	81178	80708	80708	Dombey	237	” Dombey obeyed ; giving his hand to the abstruse Cornelia , and looking at her sideways , with timid curiosity , as they went away together . For her spectacles , by reason of the glistening of the glasses , made her so mysterious , that he did n’t know where she was looking , and was not indeed quite sure that she had any eyes at all behind them . Cornelia took him first to the schoolroom , which was situated at the back of the hall , and was approached through two baize doors , which deadened and muffled the young gentlemen ’s voices . Here , there were eight young gentlemen in various stages of mental prostration , all very hard at work , and very grave indeed . Toots , as an old hand , had a desk to himself in one corner : and a magnificent man , of immense age , he looked , in Paul ’s young eyes , behind it . Mr Feeder , B.A. , who sat at another little desk , had his Virgil stop on , and was slowly grinding that tune to four young gentlemen . Of the remaining four , two , who grasped their foreheads convulsively , were engaged in solving mathematical problems ; one with his face like a dirty window , from much crying , was endeavouring to flounder through a hopeless number of lines before dinner ; and one sat looking at his task in stony stupefaction and despair — which it seemed had been his condition ever since breakfast time . The appearance of a new boy did not create the sensation that might have been expected . Mr Feeder , B.A. ( who was in the habit of shaving his head for coolness , and had nothing but little bristles on it ) , gave him a bony hand , and told him he was glad to see him — which Paul would have been very glad to have told him , if he could have done so with the least sincerity . Then Paul , instructed by Cornelia , shook hands with the four young gentlemen at Mr Feeder ’s desk ; then with the two young gentlemen at work on the problems , who were very feverish ; then with the young gentleman at work against time , who was very inky ; and lastly with the young gentleman in a state of stupefaction , who was flabby and quite cold . Paul having been already introduced to Toots , that pupil merely chuckled and breathed hard , as his custom was , and pursued the occupation in which he was engaged . It was not a severe one ; for on account of his having “
81181	81236	81237	81238	P. Toots	352	” so much ( in more senses than one ) , and also of his having , as before hinted , left off blowing in his prime , Toots now had licence to pursue his own course of study : which was chiefly to write long letters to himself from persons of distinction , adds “
81246	81503	81237	81238	P. Toots	352	” and to preserve them in his desk with great care . These ceremonies passed , Cornelia led Paul upstairs to the top of the house ; which was rather a slow journey , on account of Paul being obliged to land both feet on every stair , before he mounted another . But they reached their journey ’s end at last ; and there , in a front room , looking over the wild sea , Cornelia showed him a nice little bed with white hangings , close to the window , on which there was already beautifully written on a card in round text — down strokes very thick , and up strokes very fine — DOMBEY ; while two other little bedsteads in the same room were announced , through like means , as respectively appertaining unto BRIGGS and TOZER . Just as they got downstairs again into the hall , Paul saw the weak - eyed young man who had given that mortal offence to Mrs Pipchin , suddenly seize a very large drumstick , and fly at a gong that was hanging up , as if he had gone mad , or wanted vengeance . Instead of receiving warning , however , or being instantly taken into custody , the young man left off unchecked , after having made a dreadful noise . Then Cornelia Blimber said to Dombey that dinner would be ready in a quarter of an hour , and perhaps he had better go into the schoolroom among his “
81506	81597	81760	81760	Sir	735	” So Dombey , deferentially passing the great clock which was still as anxious as ever to know how he found himself , opened the schoolroom door a very little way , and strayed in like a lost boy : shutting it after him with some difficulty . His friends were all dispersed about the room except the stony friend , who remained immoveable . Mr Feeder was stretching himself in his grey gown , as if , regardless of expense , he were resolved to pull the sleeves off . “
81602	81615	81760	81760	Sir	735	” cried Mr Feeder , shaking himself like a cart - horse . “
81631	81749	81623	81629	Ya - a - a - ah	2505	” Paul was quite alarmed by Mr Feeder ’s yawning ; it was done on such a great scale , and he was so terribly in earnest . All the boys too ( Toots excepted ) seemed knocked up , and were getting ready for dinner — some newly tying their neckcloths , which were very stiff indeed ; and others washing their hands or brushing their hair , in an adjoining ante - chamber — as if they did n’t think they should enjoy it at all . Young Toots who was ready beforehand , and had therefore nothing to do , and had leisure to bestow upon Paul , said , with heavy good nature : “
81755	81756	81753	81753	Dombey	237	” “
81762	81799	81760	81760	Sir	735	” said Paul . His endeavouring to hoist himself on to a very high window - seat , and his slipping down again , appeared to prepare Toots ’s mind for the reception of a discovery . “
81807	81812	81802	81805	a very small chap	2507	” said Mr Toots . “
81821	81825	81817	81817	I	0	” returned Paul . “
81831	81847	81827	81827	you	0	” For Toots had lifted him into the seat , and done it kindly too . “
81853	81865	81866	81866	It	2511	” inquired Toots , after looking at him for some moments . “
81878	81882	81866	81866	It	2511	” said Paul . “
81888	81889	81883	81886	My sister ’s dressmaker	2514	” “
81897	81901	81893	81893	Burgess	355	” said Toots . “
81908	81937	81938	81938	Your	0	” Paul had wit enough to shake his head , as if he would have said it was easy to see that ; and indeed he thought so . “
81948	81953	81946	81946	he	2516	” inquired Mr Toots . “
81958	81962	81956	81956	Sir	735	” said Paul . “
81969	81970	81965	81965	Dombey	237	” “
81974	81978	81980	81980	Son	9734	” demanded Toots . “
81984	82114	81982	81982	Sir	735	” replied Paul . Mr Toots made one or two attempts , in a low voice , to fix the Firm in his mind ; but not quite succeeding , said he would get Paul to mention the name again to - morrow morning , as it was rather important . And indeed he purposed nothing less than writing himself a private and confidential letter from Dombey and Son immediately . By this time the other pupils ( always excepting the stony boy ) gathered round . They were polite , but pale ; and spoke low ; and they were so depressed in their spirits , that in comparison with the general tone of that company , Master Bitherstone was a perfect Miller , or complete Jest Book . ”
82131	82142	82144	82147	a solemn young gentleman	2522	“ You sleep in my room , do n’t you ? ”
82161	82165	82167	82167	Paul	237	“ Master Briggs ? ”
82169	82172	82174	82176	the young gentleman	2523	“ Tozer , ”
82216	82223	82225	82225	Tozer	354	“ Is yours a strong constitution ? ”
82276	82279	82274	82274	Paul	237	“ yes , ”
82730	82742	82711	82726	the Doctor , having taken a glass of port wine , and hemmed twice or thrice	2540	“ It is remarkable , Mr Feeder , that the Romans — ”
82822	82830	82832	82833	the Doctor	9751	“ It is remarkable , Mr Feeder , ”
82839	82888	82832	82833	the Doctor	9751	“ that the Romans , in those gorgeous and profuse entertainments of which we read in the days of the Emperors , when luxury had attained a height unknown before or since , and when whole provinces were ravaged to supply the splendid means of one Imperial Banquet — ”
82913	82916	82918	82919	Mr Feeder	341	“ Johnson , ”
82927	82932	82918	82919	Mr Feeder	341	“ take some water . ”
82953	82960	82933	82934	The Doctor	9751	“ And when , Mr Feeder — ”
83026	83034	83036	83037	Mr Feeder	341	“ I beg your pardon , Sir , ”
83041	83050	83036	83037	Mr Feeder	341	“ I beg your pardon , Doctor Blimber . ”
83051	83055	83057	83058	the Doctor	9751	“ And when , ”
83064	83115	83061	83061	his	9751	“ when , Sir , as we read , and have no reason to doubt — incredible as it may appear to the vulgar — of our time — the brother of Vitellius prepared for him a feast , in which were served , of fish , two thousand dishes — ”
83116	83127	83129	83130	Mr Feeder	341	“ Take some water , Johnson — dishes , Sir , ”
83132	83143	83129	83130	Mr Feeder	341	“ Of various sorts of fowl , five thousand dishes . ”
83144	83152	83154	83155	Mr Feeder	341	“ Or try a crust of bread , ”
83157	83162	83154	83155	Mr Feeder	341	“ And one dish , ”
83180	83207	83173	83173	he	336	“ called , from its enormous dimensions , the Shield of Minerva , and made , among other costly ingredients , of the brains of pheasants — ”
83208	83215	83218	83218	Johnson	357	“ Ow , ow , ow ! ”
83221	83224	83218	83218	Johnson	357	“ Woodcocks — ”
83225	83232	83173	83173	he	336	“ Ow , ow , ow ! ”
83233	83242	83218	83218	Johnson	357	“ The sounds of the fish called scari — ”
83243	83253	83255	83256	Mr Feeder	341	“ You ’ll burst some vessel in your head , ”
83258	83266	83255	83256	Mr Feeder	341	“ You had better let it come . ”
83267	83281	83283	83284	the Doctor	9751	“ And the spawn of the lamprey , brought from the Carpathian Sea , ”
83291	83312	83287	83287	his	9751	“ when we read of costly entertainments such as these , and still remember , that we have a Titus — ”
83313	83327	83329	83330	Mr Feeder	341	“ What would be your mother ’s feelings if you died of apoplexy ! ”
83332	83336	83329	83330	Mr Feeder	341	“ A Domitian — ”
83337	83346	83348	83349	Mr Feeder	341	“ And you ’re blue , you know , ”
83351	83372	83287	83287	his	9751	“ A Nero , a Tiberius , a Caligula , a Heliogabalus , and many more , pursued the Doctor ; “
83396	83485	83486	83486	Gentlemen	809	” But Johnson , unable to suppress it any longer , burst at that moment into such an overwhelming fit of coughing , that although both his immediate neighbours thumped him on the back , and Mr Feeder himself held a glass of water to his lips , and the butler walked him up and down several times between his own chair and the sideboard , like a sentry , it was a full five minutes before he was moderately composed . Then there was a profound silence . “
83488	83493	83486	83486	Gentlemen	809	” said Doctor Blimber , “
83502	83515	83516	83516	Johnson	357	down”—nothing of whom but his scalp was accordingly seen above the tablecloth . “
83564	83895	83898	83898	Sir	735	” [ Illustration ] The young gentlemen bowed and withdrew . Mr Feeder did likewise . During the half - hour , the young gentlemen , broken into pairs , loitered arm - in - arm up and down a small piece of ground behind the house , or endeavoured to kindle a spark of animation in the breast of Briggs . But nothing happened so vulgar as play . Punctually at the appointed time , the gong was sounded , and the studies , under the joint auspices of Doctor Blimber and Mr Feeder , were resumed . As the Olympic game of lounging up and down had been cut shorter than usual that day , on Johnson ’s account , they all went out for a walk before tea . Even Briggs ( though he had n’t begun yet ) partook of this dissipation ; in the enjoyment of which he looked over the cliff two or three times darkly . Doctor Blimber accompanied them ; and Paul had the honour of being taken in tow by the Doctor himself : a distinguished state of things , in which he looked very little and feeble . Tea was served in a style no less polite than the dinner ; and after tea , the young gentlemen rising and bowing as before , withdrew to fetch up the unfinished tasks of that day , or to get up the already looming tasks of to - morrow . In the meantime Mr Feeder withdrew to his own room ; and Paul sat in a corner wondering whether Florence was thinking of him , and what they were all about at Mrs Pipchin ’s . Mr Toots , who had been detained by an important letter from the Duke of Wellington , found Paul out after a time ; and having looked at him for a long while , as before , inquired if he was fond of waistcoats . Paul said “
83900	83901	83898	83898	Sir	735	” “
83906	84013	84014	84014	Gentlemen	809	” said Toots . No word more spoke Toots that night ; but he stood looking at Paul as if he liked him ; and as there was company in that , and Paul was not inclined to talk , it answered his purpose better than conversation . At eight o’clock or so , the gong sounded again for prayers in the dining - room , where the butler afterwards presided over a side - table , on which bread and cheese and beer were spread for such young gentlemen as desired to partake of those refreshments . The ceremonies concluded by the Doctor ’s saying , “
84027	84059	84060	84060	Gentlemen	809	” and then , for the first time , Paul saw Cornelia Blimber ’s eye , and saw that it was upon him . When the Doctor had said these words , “
84071	84463	84060	84060	Gentlemen	809	” the pupils bowed again , and went to bed . In the confidence of their own room upstairs , Briggs said his head ached ready to split , and that he should wish himself dead if it was n’t for his mother , and a blackbird he had at home . Tozer did n’t say much , but he sighed a good deal , and told Paul to look out , for his turn would come to - morrow . After uttering those prophetic words , he undressed himself moodily , and got into bed . Briggs was in his bed too , and Paul in his bed too , before the weak - eyed young man appeared to take away the candle , when he wished them good - night and pleasant dreams . But his benevolent wishes were in vain , as far as Briggs and Tozer were concerned ; for Paul , who lay awake for a long while , and often woke afterwards , found that Briggs was ridden by his lesson as a nightmare : and that Tozer , whose mind was affected in his sleep by similar causes , in a minor degree talked unknown tongues , or scraps of Greek and Latin — it was all one to Paul — which , in the silence of night , had an inexpressibly wicked and guilty effect . Paul had sunk into a sweet sleep , and dreamed that he was walking hand in hand with Florence through beautiful gardens , when they came to a large sunflower which suddenly expanded itself into a gong , and began to sound . Opening his eyes , he found that it was a dark , windy morning , with a drizzling rain : and that the real gong was giving dreadful note of preparation , down in the hall . So he got up directly , and found Briggs with hardly any eyes , for nightmare and grief had made his face puffy , putting his boots on : while Tozer stood shivering and rubbing his shoulders in a very bad humour . Poor Paul could n’t dress himself easily , not being used to it , and asked them if they would have the goodness to tie some strings for him ; but as Briggs merely said “
84466	84470	84060	84060	Gentlemen	809	” and Tozer , “
84474	84576	84577	84577	Melia	363	” he went down when he was otherwise ready , to the next storey , where he saw a pretty young woman in leather gloves , cleaning a stove . The young woman seemed surprised at his appearance , and asked him where his mother was . When Paul told her she was dead , she took her gloves off , and did what he wanted ; and furthermore rubbed his hands to warm them ; and gave him a kiss ; and told him whenever he wanted anything of that sort — meaning in the dressing way — to ask for “
84629	84634	84636	84636	Paul	237	“ Is that Dombey ? ”
84639	84644	84636	84636	Paul	237	“ Yes , Ma’am : ”
84660	84666	84656	84657	Miss Blimber	338	“ Come in , Dombey . ”
84758	84763	84756	84756	Dombey	237	” said Miss Blimber , “
84772	84828	84756	84756	Dombey	237	” Paul wondered what that was , and why she did n’t send the footman out to get it in such unfavourable weather . But he made no observation on the subject : his attention being devoted to a little pile of new books , on which Miss Blimber appeared to have been recently engaged . “
84835	84840	84833	84833	Dombey	237	” said Miss Blimber . “
84847	84851	84845	84845	Ma’am	219	” said Paul . “
84854	84859	84845	84845	Ma’am	219	” returned Miss Blimber ; “
84886	84887	84884	84884	Dombey	237	” “
84893	84897	84889	84889	you	219	” said Paul . “
84906	84911	84898	84898	I	0	” resumed Miss Blimber ; “
84984	84985	84969	84969	you	237	” “
84990	85054	84969	84969	you	237	” answered Paul . There were so many of them , that although Paul put one hand under the bottom book and his other hand and his chin on the top book , and hugged them all closely , the middle book slipped out before he reached the door , and then they all tumbled down on the floor . Miss Blimber said , “
85067	85186	84969	84969	you	237	” and piled them up afresh for him ; and this time , by dint of balancing them with great nicety , Paul got out of the room , and down a few stairs before two of them escaped again . But he held the rest so tight , that he only left one more on the first floor , and one in the passage ; and when he had got the main body down into the schoolroom , he set off upstairs again to collect the stragglers . Having at last amassed the whole library , and climbed into his place , he fell to work , encouraged by a remark from Tozer to the effect that he “
85193	85240	84969	84969	you	237	” which was the only interruption he received till breakfast time . At that meal , for which he had no appetite , everything was quite as solemn and genteel as at the others ; and when it was finished , he followed Miss Blimber upstairs . “
85245	85250	85243	85243	Dombey	237	” said Miss Blimber . “
85260	85410	85253	85253	you	237	” They comprised a little English , and a deal of Latin — names of things , declensions of articles and substantives , exercises thereon , and preliminary rules — a trifle of orthography , a glance at ancient history , a wink or two at modern ditto , a few tables , two or three weights and measures , and a little general information . When poor Paul had spelt out number two , he found he had no idea of number one ; fragments whereof afterwards obtruded themselves into number three , which slided into number four , which grafted itself on to number two . So that whether twenty Romuluses made a Remus , or hic haec hoc was troy weight , or a verb always agreed with an ancient Briton , or three times four was Taurus a bull , were open questions with him . “
85417	85422	85413	85413	Dombey	237	” said Miss Blimber , “
85428	85429	85413	85413	Dombey	237	” “
85434	85438	85431	85431	you	2567	” said Paul , “
85460	85461	85452	85452	I	0	” “
85466	85471	85464	85464	Dombey	237	” said Miss Blimber . “
85545	85546	85526	85526	I	0	” “
85551	85555	85548	85548	Papa	242	” returned Paul ; “
85577	85578	85575	85575	Wickam	302	” “
85583	85588	85581	85581	Wickam	302	” asked Miss Blimber . “
85595	85599	85589	85589	She	302	” Paul answered . “
85613	85618	85603	85603	you	0	” said Miss Blimber . “
85624	85626	85627	85627	You	2567	” . “
85634	85638	85627	85627	You	2567	” said Paul . “
85642	85647	85627	85627	You	2567	” returned Miss Blimber ; “
85709	85826	85661	85661	Dombey	237	” Miss Blimber expressed her opinions on the subject of Paul ’s uninstructed state with a gloomy delight , as if she had expected this result , and were glad to find that they must be in constant communication . Paul withdrew with the top task , as he was told , and laboured away at it , down below : sometimes remembering every word of it , and sometimes forgetting it all , and everything else besides : until at last he ventured upstairs again to repeat the lesson , when it was nearly all driven out of his head before he began , by Miss Blimber ’s shutting up the book , and saying , “
85832	85989	85830	85830	Dombey	237	” a proceeding so suggestive of the knowledge inside of her , that Paul looked upon the young lady with consternation , as a kind of learned Guy Fawkes , or artificial Bogle , stuffed full of scholastic straw . He acquitted himself very well , nevertheless ; and Miss Blimber , commending him as giving promise of getting on fast , immediately provided him with subject B ; from which he passed to C , and even D before dinner . It was hard work , resuming his studies , soon after dinner ; and he felt giddy and confused and drowsy and dull . But all the other young gentlemen had similar sensations , and were obliged to resume their studies too , if there were any comfort in that . It was a wonder that the great clock in the hall , instead of being constant to its first inquiry , never said , “
85999	86457	86461	86461	Susan	241	” for that phrase was often enough repeated in its neighbourhood . The studies went round like a mighty wheel , and the young gentlemen were always stretched upon it . After tea there were exercises again , and preparations for next day by candlelight . And in due course there was bed ; where , but for that resumption of the studies which took place in dreams , were rest and sweet forgetfulness . Oh Saturdays ! Oh happy Saturdays , when Florence always came at noon , and never would , in any weather , stay away , though Mrs Pipchin snarled and growled , and worried her bitterly . Those Saturdays were Sabbaths for at least two little Christians among all the Jews , and did the holy Sabbath work of strengthening and knitting up a brother ’s and a sister ’s love . Not even Sunday nights — the heavy Sunday nights , whose shadow darkened the first waking burst of light on Sunday mornings — could mar those precious Saturdays . Whether it was the great sea - shore , where they sat , and strolled together ; or whether it was only Mrs Pipchin ’s dull back room , in which she sang to him so softly , with his drowsy head upon her arm ; Paul never cared . It was Florence . That was all he thought of . So , on Sunday nights , when the Doctor ’s dark door stood agape to swallow him up for another week , the time was come for taking leave of Florence ; no one else . Mrs Wickam had been drafted home to the house in town , and Miss Nipper , now a smart young woman , had come down . To many a single combat with Mrs Pipchin , did Miss Nipper gallantly devote herself , and if ever Mrs Pipchin in all her life had found her match , she had found it now . Miss Nipper threw away the scabbard the first morning she arose in Mrs Pipchin ’s house . She asked and gave no quarter . She said it must be war , and war it was ; and Mrs Pipchin lived from that time in the midst of surprises , harassings , and defiances , and skirmishing attacks that came bouncing in upon her from the passage , even in unguarded moments of chops , and carried desolation to her very toast . Miss Nipper had returned one Sunday night with Florence , from walking back with Paul to the Doctor ’s , when Florence took from her bosom a little piece of paper , on which she had pencilled down some words . “
86463	86467	86461	86461	Susan	241	” she said . “
86503	86504	86493	86493	I	0	” “
86519	86523	86524	86524	I	0	” returned Nipper , “
86532	86533	86529	86530	Mrs Pipchin	307	” “
86557	86561	86552	86552	I	0	” said Florence . “
86571	86576	86568	86569	Miss Floy	197	” returned Miss Nipper , “
86704	86705	86721	86721	you	197	” “
86728	86729	86732	86732	Miss	2580	” “
86741	86752	86737	86737	you	197	” replied Nipper ; adding , in a lower voice , “
86772	86773	86774	86774	Paul	237	” “
86786	86790	86784	86784	Susan	241	” said Florence , “
86797	86798	86784	86784	Susan	241	” “
86807	86812	86801	86801	you	197	” returned her maid , “
86835	86850	86871	86871	Susan	241	” exclaimed Miss Nipper , with strong feeling — in allusion to Paul ’s ; “
86856	86857	86858	86858	I	0	” “
86873	86882	86871	86871	Susan	241	” pursued Florence , turning away her face . “
86885	86894	86897	86897	them	2583	” said Miss Nipper , with great sharpness , “
86901	86902	86897	86897	them	2583	” “
86908	86912	86897	86897	them	2583	” said Florence . “
86918	86919	86920	86920	I	0	” “
86928	86933	86926	86926	Miss	2585	” cried Miss Nipper , “
86972	86992	86962	86963	Miss Blimber	338	” After this speech , Miss Nipper , who was perfectly serious , wiped her eyes . [ Illustration ] “
87011	87015	87006	87006	I	0	” said Florence , “
87057	87438	87440	87440	his	2590	” It must have been a harder heart than Susan Nipper ’s that could have rejected the little purse Florence held out with these words , or the gentle look of entreaty with which she seconded her petition . Susan put the purse in her pocket without reply , and trotted out at once upon her errand . The books were not easy to procure ; and the answer at several shops was , either that they were just out of them , or that they never kept them , or that they had had a great many last month , or that they expected a great many next week But Susan was not easily baffled in such an enterprise ; and having entrapped a white - haired youth , in a black calico apron , from a library where she was known , to accompany her in her quest , she led him such a life in going up and down , that he exerted himself to the utmost , if it were only to get rid of her ; and finally enabled her to return home in triumph . With these treasures then , after her own daily lessons were over , Florence sat down at night to track Paul ’s footsteps through the thorny ways of learning ; and being possessed of a naturally quick and sound capacity , and taught by that most wonderful of masters , love , it was not long before she gained upon Paul ’s heels , and caught and passed him . Not a word of this was breathed to Mrs Pipchin : but many a night when they were all in bed , and when Miss Nipper , with her hair in papers and herself asleep in some uncomfortable attitude , reposed unconscious by her side ; and when the chinking ashes in the grate were cold and grey ; and when the candles were burnt down and guttering out;—Florence tried so hard to be a substitute for one small Dombey , that her fortitude and perseverance might have almost won her a free right to bear the name herself . And high was her reward , when one Saturday evening , as little Paul was sitting down as usual to “
87443	87519	87440	87440	his	2590	” she sat down by his side , and showed him all that was so rough , made smooth , and all that was so dark , made clear and plain , before him . It was nothing but a startled look in Paul ’s wan face — a flush — a smile — and then a close embrace — but God knows how her heart leapt up at this rich payment for her trouble . “
87524	87529	87440	87440	his	2590	” cried her brother , “
87542	87543	87538	87538	you	197	” “
87550	87551	87545	87545	I	0	” “
87562	88166	87560	87560	Floy	197	” He said no more about it , but all that evening sat close by her , very quiet ; and in the night he called out from his little room within hers , three or four times , that he loved her . Regularly , after that , Florence was prepared to sit down with Paul on Saturday night , and patiently assist him through so much as they could anticipate together of his next week ’s work . The cheering thought that he was labouring on where Florence had just toiled before him , would , of itself , have been a stimulant to Paul in the perpetual resumption of his studies ; but coupled with the actual lightening of his load , consequent on this assistance , it saved him , possibly , from sinking underneath the burden which the fair Cornelia Blimber piled upon his back . It was not that Miss Blimber meant to be too hard upon him , or that Doctor Blimber meant to bear too heavily on the young gentlemen in general . Cornelia merely held the faith in which she had been bred ; and the Doctor , in some partial confusion of his ideas , regarded the young gentlemen as if they were all Doctors , and were born grown up . Comforted by the applause of the young gentlemen ’s nearest relations , and urged on by their blind vanity and ill - considered haste , it would have been strange if Doctor Blimber had discovered his mistake , or trimmed his swelling sails to any other tack . Thus in the case of Paul . When Doctor Blimber said he made great progress and was naturally clever , Mr Dombey was more bent than ever on his being forced and crammed . In the case of Briggs , when Doctor Blimber reported that he did not make great progress yet , and was not naturally clever , Briggs senior was inexorable in the same purpose . In short , however high and false the temperature at which the Doctor kept his hothouse , the owners of the plants were always ready to lend a helping hand at the bellows , and to stir the fire . Such spirits as he had in the outset , Paul soon lost of course . But he retained all that was strange , and old , and thoughtful in his character : and under circumstances so favourable to the development of those tendencies , became even more strange , and old , and thoughtful , than before . The only difference was , that he kept his character to himself . He grew more thoughtful and reserved , every day ; and had no such curiosity in any living member of the Doctor ’s household , as he had had in Mrs Pipchin . He loved to be alone ; and in those short intervals when he was not occupied with his books , liked nothing so well as wandering about the house by himself , or sitting on the stairs , listening to the great clock in the hall . He was intimate with all the paperhanging in the house ; saw things that no one else saw in the patterns ; found out miniature tigers and lions running up the bedroom walls , and squinting faces leering in the squares and diamonds of the floor - cloth . The solitary child lived on , surrounded by this arabesque work of his musing fancy , and no one understood him . Mrs Blimber thought him “
88169	88180	88426	88426	you	735	” and sometimes the servants said among themselves that little Dombey “
88183	88338	88426	88426	you	735	” but that was all . Unless young Toots had some idea on the subject , to the expression of which he was wholly unequal . Ideas , like ghosts ( according to the common notion of ghosts ) , must be spoken to a little before they will explain themselves ; and Toots had long left off asking any questions of his own mind . Some mist there may have been , issuing from that leaden casket , his cranium , which , if it could have taken shape and form , would have become a genie ; but it could not ; and it only so far followed the example of the smoke in the Arabian story , as to roll out in a thick cloud , and there hang and hover . But it left a little figure visible upon a lonely shore , and Toots was always staring at it . “
88343	88355	88426	88426	you	735	” he would say to Paul , fifty times a day . “
88364	88369	88359	88359	Sir	735	” Paul would answer . “
88373	88407	88359	88359	Sir	735	” would be Toots ’s next advance . Which Paul , of course , would immediately do . Mr Toots generally said again , after a long interval of staring and hard breathing , “
88412	88419	88423	88423	Sir	735	” To which Paul again replied , “
88428	88486	88487	88487	I	0	” One evening Mr Toots was sitting at his desk , oppressed by correspondence , when a great purpose seemed to flash upon him . He laid down his pen , and went off to seek Paul , whom he found at last , after a long search , looking through the window of his little bedroom . “
88490	88508	88511	88511	you	2592	” cried Toots , speaking the moment he entered the room , lest he should forget it ; “
88515	88516	88511	88511	you	2592	” “
88527	88531	88519	88519	I	0	” replied Paul . “
88537	88550	88533	88533	you	2592	” said Toots , appearing to consider that fact in itself surprising . “
88557	88576	88533	88533	you	2592	” said Paul , looking up into his face — Mr Toots started , and seemed much disturbed . “
88608	88631	88533	88533	you	2592	” Mr Toots said , looking doubtfully at Paul , and shaking his head , that he did n’t know about that . “
88638	88642	88533	88533	you	2592	” said Paul , “
88702	88733	88734	88734	Smugglers	2598	” The child looked at him so steadfastly , and spoke so earnestly , that Mr Toots , feeling himself called upon to say something about this boat , said , “
88736	88754	88734	88734	Smugglers	2598	” But with an impartial remembrance of there being two sides to every question , he added , “
88758	88759	88734	88734	Smugglers	2598	” “
88766	88770	88734	88734	Smugglers	2598	” repeated Paul , “
88811	88812	88788	88788	It	2597	” “
88815	88820	88788	88788	It	2597	” said Mr Toots . “
88826	88831	88841	88841	she	2601	” said the child , “
88844	88865	88841	88841	she	2601	” Toots was almost beside himself with dismay at this sudden exclamation , after what had gone before , and cried “
88868	88869	88870	88871	My sister	10239	” “
88874	88878	88885	88885	her	197	” cried Paul , “
88910	90558	90559	90560	Mr Dombey	190	” His quick transition to a state of unbounded pleasure , as he stood at his window , kissing and clapping his hands : and the way in which the light retreated from his features as she passed out of his view , and left a patient melancholy on the little face : were too remarkable wholly to escape even Toots ’s notice . Their interview being interrupted at this moment by a visit from Mrs Pipchin , who usually brought her black skirts to bear upon Paul just before dusk , once or twice a week , Toots had no opportunity of improving the occasion : but it left so marked an impression on his mind that he twice returned , after having exchanged the usual salutations , to ask Mrs Pipchin how she did . This the irascible old lady conceived to be a deeply devised and long - meditated insult , originating in the diabolical invention of the weak - eyed young man downstairs , against whom she accordingly lodged a formal complaint with Doctor Blimber that very night ; who mentioned to the young man that if he ever did it again , he should be obliged to part with him . The evenings being longer now , Paul stole up to his window every evening to look out for Florence . She always passed and repassed at a certain time , until she saw him ; and their mutual recognition was a gleam of sunshine in Paul ’s daily life . Often after dark , one other figure walked alone before the Doctor ’s house . He rarely joined them on the Saturdays now . He could not bear it . He would rather come unrecognised , and look up at the windows where his son was qualifying for a man ; and wait , and watch , and plan , and hope . Oh ! could he but have seen , or seen as others did , the slight spare boy above , watching the waves and clouds at twilight , with his earnest eyes , and breasting the window of his solitary cage when birds flew by , as if he would have emulated them , and soared away ! CHAPTER XIII . Shipping Intelligence and Office Business Mr Dombey ’s offices were in a court where there was an old - established stall of choice fruit at the corner : where perambulating merchants , of both sexes , offered for sale at any time between the hours of ten and five , slippers , pocket - books , sponges , dogs ’ collars , and Windsor soap ; and sometimes a pointer or an oil - painting . The pointer always came that way , with a view to the Stock Exchange , where a sporting taste ( originating generally in bets of new hats ) is much in vogue . The other commodities were addressed to the general public ; but they were never offered by the vendors to Mr Dombey . When he appeared , the dealers in those wares fell off respectfully . The principal slipper and dogs ’ collar man — who considered himself a public character , and whose portrait was screwed on to an artist ’s door in Cheapside — threw up his forefinger to the brim of his hat as Mr Dombey went by . The ticket - porter , if he were not absent on a job , always ran officiously before , to open Mr Dombey ’s office door as wide as possible , and hold it open , with his hat off , while he entered . The clerks within were not a whit behind - hand in their demonstrations of respect . A solemn hush prevailed , as Mr Dombey passed through the outer office . The wit of the Counting - House became in a moment as mute as the row of leathern fire - buckets hanging up behind him . Such vapid and flat daylight as filtered through the ground - glass windows and skylights , leaving a black sediment upon the panes , showed the books and papers , and the figures bending over them , enveloped in a studious gloom , and as much abstracted in appearance , from the world without , as if they were assembled at the bottom of the sea ; while a mouldy little strong room in the obscure perspective , where a shaded lamp was always burning , might have represented the cavern of some ocean monster , looking on with a red eye at these mysteries of the deep . When Perch the messenger , whose place was on a little bracket , like a timepiece , saw Mr Dombey come in — or rather when he felt that he was coming , for he had usually an instinctive sense of his approach — he hurried into Mr Dombey ’s room , stirred the fire , carried fresh coals from the bowels of the coal - box , hung the newspaper to air upon the fender , put the chair ready , and the screen in its place , and was round upon his heel on the instant of Mr Dombey ’s entrance , to take his great - coat and hat , and hang them up . Then Perch took the newspaper , and gave it a turn or two in his hands before the fire , and laid it , deferentially , at Mr Dombey ’s elbow . And so little objection had Perch to being deferential in the last degree , that if he might have laid himself at Mr Dombey ’s feet , or might have called him by some such title as used to be bestowed upon the Caliph Haroun Alraschid , he would have been all the better pleased . As this honour would have been an innovation and an experiment , Perch was fain to content himself by expressing as well as he could , in his manner , You are the light of my Eyes . You are the Breath of my Soul . You are the commander of the Faithful Perch ! With this imperfect happiness to cheer him , he would shut the door softly , walk away on tiptoe , and leave his great chief to be stared at , through a dome - shaped window in the leads , by ugly chimney - pots and backs of houses , and especially by the bold window of a hair - cutting saloon on a first floor , where a waxen effigy , bald as a Mussulman in the morning , and covered , after eleven o’clock in the day , with luxuriant hair and whiskers in the latest Christian fashion , showed him the wrong side of its head for ever . Between Mr Dombey and the common world , as it was accessible through the medium of the outer office — to which Mr Dombey ’s presence in his own room may be said to have struck like damp , or cold air — there were two degrees of descent . Mr Carker in his own office was the first step ; Mr Morfin , in his own office , was the second . Each of these gentlemen occupied a little chamber like a bath - room , opening from the passage outside Mr Dombey ’s door . Mr Carker , as Grand Vizier , inhabited the room that was nearest to the Sultan . Mr Morfin , as an officer of inferior state , inhabited the room that was nearest to the clerks . The gentleman last mentioned was a cheerful - looking , hazel - eyed elderly bachelor : gravely attired , as to his upper man , in black ; and as to his legs , in pepper - and - salt colour . His dark hair was just touched here and there with specks of gray , as though the tread of Time had splashed it ; and his whiskers were already white . He had a mighty respect for Mr Dombey , and rendered him due homage ; but as he was of a genial temper himself , and never wholly at his ease in that stately presence , he was disquieted by no jealousy of the many conferences enjoyed by Mr Carker , and felt a secret satisfaction in having duties to discharge , which rarely exposed him to be singled out for such distinction . He was a great musical amateur in his way — after business ; and had a paternal affection for his violoncello , which was once in every week transported from Islington , his place of abode , to a certain club - room hard by the Bank , where quartettes of the most tormenting and excruciating nature were executed every Wednesday evening by a private party . Mr Carker was a gentleman thirty - eight or forty years old , of a florid complexion , and with two unbroken rows of glistening teeth , whose regularity and whiteness were quite distressing . It was impossible to escape the observation of them , for he showed them whenever he spoke ; and bore so wide a smile upon his countenance ( a smile , however , very rarely , indeed , extending beyond his mouth ) , that there was something in it like the snarl of a cat . He affected a stiff white cravat , after the example of his principal , and was always closely buttoned up and tightly dressed . His manner towards Mr Dombey was deeply conceived and perfectly expressed . He was familiar with him , in the very extremity of his sense of the distance between them . “
90635	90793	90623	90624	Mr Dombey	190	” If he had carried these words about with him printed on a placard , and had constantly offered it to Mr Dombey ’s perusal on the breast of his coat , he could not have been more explicit than he was . This was Carker the Manager . Mr Carker the Junior , Walter ’s friend , was his brother ; two or three years older than he , but widely removed in station . The younger brother ’s post was on the top of the official ladder ; the elder brother ’s at the bottom . The elder brother never gained a stave , or raised his foot to mount one . Young men passed above his head , and rose and rose ; but he was always at the bottom . He was quite resigned to occupy that low condition : never complained of it : and certainly never hoped to escape from it . “
90801	90829	90796	90796	you	2609	” said Mr Carker the Manager , entering Mr Dombey ’s room soon after his arrival one day : with a bundle of papers in his hand . “
90837	90842	90832	90832	you	2609	” said Mr Dombey . “
90845	90853	90832	90832	you	2609	” observed Carker , stirring the fire . “
90856	90861	90832	90832	you	2609	” said Mr Dombey . “
90876	90889	90865	90874	the young gentleman who is so important to us all	2610	” asked Carker , with his whole regiment of teeth on parade . “
90903	90923	90898	90898	he	2610	” said Mr Dombey . Who had come from Brighton over - night . But no one knew It . “
90936	90941	90942	90942	I	0	” observed the Manager . “
90946	90951	90942	90942	I	0	” returned Mr Dombey . “
90954	90963	90942	90942	I	0	” said Mr Carker , shaking his head , “
90967	90968	90969	90969	I	0	” “
90975	90985	90969	90969	I	0	” returned Mr Dombey , glancing at his newspaper . “
90998	91002	90990	90990	You	0	” observed Carker . “
91083	91084	91072	91072	I	0	” “
91093	91112	91091	91091	Carker	193	” said Mr Dombey , rising from his chair , and standing with his back to the fire . “
91120	91121	91091	91091	Carker	193	” “
91132	91144	91130	91130	you	0	” returned Carker , turning over the papers in his hand . “
91156	91157	91147	91148	a committee	2616	” “
91167	91172	91147	91148	a committee	2616	” added Mr Dombey . “
91178	91188	91147	91148	a committee	2616	” exclaimed Carker , still turning over his papers . “
91212	91213	91208	91208	you	193	” “
91223	91228	91220	91220	your	193	” said Mr Dombey . “
91233	91238	91231	91231	I	0	” returned the manager . “
91250	91358	91231	91231	I	0	” Mr Dombey did not look less pompous or at all displeased , as he stood leaning against the chimney - piece , surveying his ( of course unconscious ) clerk , from head to foot . The stiffness and nicety of Mr Carker ’s dress , and a certain arrogance of manner , either natural to him or imitated from a pattern not far off , gave great additional effect to his humility . He seemed a man who would contend against the power that vanquished him , if he could , but who was utterly borne down by the greatness and superiority of Mr Dombey . “
91363	91392	91393	91393	Morfin	253	” asked Mr Dombey after a short pause , during which Mr Carker had been fluttering his papers , and muttering little abstracts of their contents to himself . “
91397	91411	91393	91393	Morfin	253	” he answered , looking up with his widest and almost sudden smile ; “
91459	91460	91441	91441	he	253	” “
91470	91475	91467	91467	I	0	” said Mr Dombey . “
91478	91493	91467	91467	I	0	” inquired Carker , with another wide and most feline show of his teeth . “
91509	91521	91503	91503	I	0	” he murmured , as if he were only thinking it , “
91527	91599	91602	91602	Morfin	253	” A dangerous quality , if real ; and a not less dangerous one , if feigned . But Mr Dombey hardly seemed to think so , as he still stood with his back to the fire , drawn up to his full height , and looking at his head - clerk with a dignified composure , in which there seemed to lurk a stronger latent sense of power than usual . “
91604	91617	91618	91618	he	253	” resumed Mr Carker , taking out one paper from the rest , “
91671	91681	91665	91669	nobody of that sort here	2630	” Mr Dombey shook his head with supreme indifference . “
91689	91712	91665	91669	nobody of that sort here	2630	” observed Mr Carker , taking up a pen , with which to endorse a memorandum on the back of the paper . “
91752	91753	91754	91754	I	0	” “
91772	91790	91770	91770	Sir	735	” answered Walter ; appearing with some letters in his hand , unopened , and newly arrived . “
91798	91854	91796	91796	Sir	735	” At the mention of this name , Mr Carker the Manager was or affected to be , touched to the quick with shame and humiliation . He cast his eyes full on Mr Dombey with an altered and apologetic look , abased them on the ground , and remained for a moment without speaking . “
91860	91871	91858	91858	Sir	735	” he said suddenly and angrily , turning on Walter , “
91889	91890	91883	91884	the Junior	11471	” “
91896	91900	91891	91891	I	0	” returned Walter . “
91948	91949	91946	91946	Sir	735	” “
91955	91969	91953	91953	Sir	735	” returned Mr Carker the Manager , plucking them sharply from his hand . “
91975	92132	91972	91972	your	735	” But in taking them with so little ceremony , Mr Carker dropped one on the floor , and did not see what he had done ; neither did Mr Dombey observe the letter lying near his feet . Walter hesitated for a moment , thinking that one or other of them would notice it ; but finding that neither did , he stopped , came back , picked it up , and laid it himself on Mr Dombey ’s desk . The letters were post - letters ; and it happened that the one in question was Mrs Pipchin ’s regular report , directed as usual — for Mrs Pipchin was but an indifferent penwoman — by Florence . Mr Dombey , having his attention silently called to this letter by Walter , started , and looked fiercely at him , as if he believed that he had purposely selected it from all the rest . “
92141	92175	92139	92139	Sir	735	” said Mr Dombey , haughtily . He crushed the letter in his hand ; and having watched Walter out at the door , put it in his pocket without breaking the seal . “
92185	92199	92223	92223	Carker	193	” Mr Carker the Manager began , as soon as they were alone , “
92219	92220	92223	92223	Carker	193	” “
92225	92230	92223	92223	Carker	193	” Mr Dombey interrupted . “
92236	92237	92231	92231	You	193	” “
92242	92246	92231	92231	You	193	” he returned . “
92273	92310	92311	92311	You	193	” As Mr Dombey ’s thoughts were evidently pursuing some other subject , his discreet ally broke off here , and stood with his teeth ready to present to him , when he should look up . “
92325	92332	92321	92321	you	193	” observed Mr Dombey , hurriedly . “
92335	92339	92321	92321	you	193	” replied Carker . “
92344	92345	92341	92342	young Gay	293	” “
92355	92386	92321	92321	you	193	” said Mr Carker , without any show of surprise , and taking up the pen to re - endorse the letter , as coolly as he had done before . “
92393	92394	92396	92396	him	293	” “
92399	92419	92420	92420	Gay	293	” said Mr Dombey . Mr Carker was quick to do so , and Walter was quick to return . “
92422	92438	92420	92420	Gay	293	” said Mr Dombey , turning a little to look at him over his shoulder . “
92443	92444	92321	92321	you	193	” “
92448	92461	92321	92321	you	193	” said Mr Carker , with his mouth stretched to the utmost . “
92477	92489	92470	92470	I	0	” said Mr Dombey , scorning to embellish the bare truth , “
92522	92547	92511	92511	I	0	” Walter ’s breath was so completely taken away by his astonishment , that he could hardly find enough for the repetition of the words “
92551	92552	92511	92511	I	0	” “
92557	92562	92553	92553	Somebody	1665	” said Mr Dombey , “
92606	92607	92580	92581	your Uncle	11039	” “
92615	92619	92609	92609	I	0	” inquired Walter . “
92627	92640	92621	92621	you	0	” repeated Mr Dombey , turning a little more round towards him . “
92653	92654	92648	92648	he	11039	” “
92660	92664	92658	92658	Sir	735	” faltered Walter . “
92667	92675	92658	92658	Sir	735	” returned Mr Dombey . Walter bowed . “
92680	92689	92690	92690	You	193	” said Mr Dombey , resuming his letters . “
92718	92719	92711	92711	He	11039	” “
92727	92737	92725	92725	Gay	293	” observed Mr Carker : bare to the gums . “
92740	92760	92762	92762	he	11039	” said Mr Dombey , stopping in his reading without looking off the letter , and seeming to listen . “
92768	92769	92762	92762	he	11039	” “
92774	92832	92772	92772	Sir	735	” returned Walter , agitated and confused , and almost stunned , as an infinite variety of pictures presented themselves to his mind ; among which Captain Cuttle , in his glazed hat , transfixed with astonishment at Mrs MacStinger ’s , and his uncle bemoaning his loss in the little back parlour , held prominent places . “
92846	92847	92844	92844	Sir	735	” “
92855	92949	92853	92853	Carker	193	” said Mr Dombey . And as Mr Carker again echoed the words , and also collected his papers as if he were going away too , Walter felt that his lingering any longer would be an unpardonable intrusion — especially as he had nothing to say — and therefore walked out quite confounded . Going along the passage , with the mingled consciousness and helplessness of a dream , he heard Mr Dombey ’s door shut again , as Mr Carker came out : and immediately afterwards that gentleman called to him . “
92967	93076	92961	92961	Sir	735	” Walter went to the outer office and apprised Mr Carker the Junior of his errand , who accordingly came out from behind a partition where he sat alone in one corner , and returned with him to the room of Mr Carker the Manager . That gentleman was standing with his back to the fire , and his hands under his coat - tails , looking over his white cravat , as unpromisingly as Mr Dombey himself could have looked . He received them without any change in his attitude or softening of his harsh and black expression : merely signing to Walter to close the door . “
93080	93111	93077	93078	John Carker	274	” said the Manager , when this was done , turning suddenly upon his brother , with his two rows of teeth bristling as if he would have bitten him , “
93164	93165	93169	93169	James	368	” “
93171	93188	93169	93169	James	368	” interposed the other in a low voice , finding that he stammered for a word . “
93200	93201	93169	93169	James	368	” “
93206	93214	93169	93169	James	368	” assented his brother with keen emphasis , “
93263	93264	93260	93261	John Carker	274	” “
93267	93272	93260	93261	John Carker	274	” returned the other . “
93285	93286	93279	93279	I	0	” “
93294	93299	93289	93289	your	274	” said his brother , “
93318	93319	93312	93312	you	274	” “
93330	93331	93326	93326	James	368	” “
93337	93342	93332	93332	You	368	” said the Manager . “
93348	93349	93350	93350	I	0	” “
93359	93360	93357	93357	James	368	” “
93368	93483	93363	93363	you	0	” During this conversation , Walter had looked from one brother to the other , with pain and amazement . He who was the Senior in years , and Junior in the House , stood , with his eyes cast upon the ground , and his head bowed , humbly listening to the reproaches of the other . Though these were rendered very bitter by the tone and look with which they were accompanied , and by the presence of Walter whom they so much surprised and shocked , he entered no other protest against them than by slightly raising his right hand in a deprecatory manner , as if he would have said , “
93487	93550	93551	93552	Mr Carker	274	” So , had they been blows , and he a brave man , under strong constraint , and weakened by bodily suffering , he might have stood before the executioner . Generous and quick in all his emotions , and regarding himself as the innocent occasion of these taunts , Walter now struck in , with all the earnestness he felt . “
93554	93564	93551	93552	Mr Carker	274	” he said , addressing himself to the Manager . “
93664	93674	93678	93678	my	0	” added Walter , after a moment ’s pause , “
93720	93756	93757	93757	I	0	” Walter said this from his soul , and with the very breath of honour . For he looked upon the bowed head , and the downcast eyes , and upraised hand , and thought , “
93778	93811	93812	93812	You	2671	” Mr Carker the Manager looked at him , as he spoke , and when he had finished speaking , with a smile that seemed to divide his face into two parts . “
93820	93824	93812	93812	You	2671	” he said ; “
93893	93894	93895	93895	James	368	” “
93901	93906	93895	93895	James	368	” said his brother . “
93923	93924	93925	93925	Honour	265	” “
93927	93944	93918	93918	me	0	” said his brother , with another smile , as he warmed himself before the fire . “
93954	93983	93918	93918	me	0	” returned the other , in the same low voice , but with a deeper stress on his words than he had yet seemed capable of giving them . “
94011	94022	94024	94024	Walter	293	“ Indeed , you have avoided me , Mr Carker , ”
94040	94092	94024	94024	Walter	293	“ I know it , to my disappointment and regret . When I first came here , and ever since , I am sure I have tried to be as much your friend , as one of my age could presume to be ; but it has been of no use . “
94096	94106	94024	94024	Walter	293	” said the Manager , taking him up quickly , “
94151	94152	94146	94146	he	274	” “
94160	94165	94146	94146	he	274	” said the brother . “
94198	94214	94188	94189	No one	9841	” he spoke here very distinctly , as if he would impress it upon Walter : “
94232	94233	94234	94234	Your	293	” “
94250	94265	94266	94266	I	0	” said Mr Carker the Manager , warming himself with great and increased satisfaction , “
94281	94287	94277	94279	the best authority	2679	” nodding towards his brother . “
94310	94381	94306	94306	You	293	” Walter passed out at the door , and was about to close it after him , when , hearing the voices of the brothers again , and also the mention of his own name , he stood irresolutely , with his hand upon the lock , and the door ajar , uncertain whether to return or go away . In this position he could not help overhearing what followed . “
94394	94399	94392	94392	James	368	” said John Carker , “
94419	94423	94410	94410	I	0	here”—striking himself upon the breast—“my
94452	94453	94442	94442	he	2037	” “
94458	94465	94454	94456	Your other self	2683	” repeated the Manager , disdainfully . “
94520	94521	94522	94522	I	0	” “
94526	94541	94522	94522	I	0	” said his brother , with some hidden and sarcastic meaning in his tone . “
94560	94584	94554	94554	your	2682	” returned the other , speaking ( or so Walter thought ) as if some cruel weapon actually stabbed him as he spoke . “
94631	94632	94608	94608	him	2686	” “
94637	94648	94608	94608	him	2686	” interrupted his brother , as he stirred the fire . “
94661	94662	94608	94608	him	2686	” “
94669	94674	94665	94666	ONE traveller	2688	” returned the other , “
94734	94735	94736	94736	You	0	” “
94745	94750	94739	94739	yourself	0	” returned the brother . “
94754	94761	94752	94752	myself	0	” he assented with a sigh . “
94773	94774	94775	94775	You	0	” “
94781	94804	94775	94775	You	0	” James Carker muttered through his teeth . And , through so many and such close teeth , he could mutter well . “
94809	94844	94807	94807	James	368	” returned his brother , speaking for the first time in an accent of reproach , and seeming , by the sound of his voice , to have covered his face with his hands , “
94877	94922	94874	94874	your	368	” A silence ensued . After a time , Mr Carker the Manager was heard rustling among his papers , as if he had resolved to bring the interview to a conclusion . At the same time his brother withdrew nearer to the door . “
94927	94931	94874	94874	your	368	” he said . “
95091	95132	95085	95085	James	368	” With these words he came out to where Walter was standing . He turned a little paler when he saw him there , and paler yet when Walter caught him by the hand , and said in a whisper : “
95195	95293	95294	95294	Walter	293	” said Walter , squeezing both his hands , and hardly knowing , in his agitation , what he did or said . Mr Morfin ’s room being close at hand and empty , and the door wide open , they moved thither by one accord : the passage being seldom free from someone passing to or fro . When they were there , and Walter saw in Mr Carker ’s face some traces of the emotion within , he almost felt as if he had never seen the face before ; it was so greatly changed . “
95296	95307	95294	95294	Walter	293	” he said , laying his hand on his shoulder . “
95328	95329	95322	95322	you	293	” “
95334	95349	95322	95322	you	293	” appeared to hang on Walter ’s lips , as he regarded him attentively . “
95354	95358	95322	95322	you	293	” said Carker , “
95423	95449	95420	95420	I	0	” Again his last few words hung trembling upon Walter ’s lips , but he could neither utter them , nor any of his own . “
95671	96005	95652	95652	Walter	293	” Some recollection of his trembling from head to foot , as if with excessive cold , and of his bursting into tears , was all that Walter could add to this , when he tried to recall exactly what had passed between them . When Walter saw him next , he was bending over his desk in his old silent , drooping , humbled way . Then , observing him at his work , and feeling how resolved he evidently was that no further intercourse should arise between them , and thinking again and again on all he had seen and heard that morning in so short a time , in connexion with the history of both the Carkers , Walter could hardly believe that he was under orders for the West Indies , and would soon be lost to Uncle Sol , and Captain Cuttle , and to glimpses few and far between of Florence Dombey — no , he meant Paul — and to all he loved , and liked , and looked for , in his daily life . But it was true , and the news had already penetrated to the outer office ; for while he sat with a heavy heart , pondering on these things , and resting his head upon his arm , Perch the messenger , descending from his mahogany bracket , and jogging his elbow , begged his pardon , but wished to say in his ear , Did he think he could arrange to send home to England a jar of preserved Ginger , cheap , for Mrs Perch ’s own eating , in the course of her recovery from her next confinement ? CHAPTER XIV . Paul grows more and more Old - fashioned , and goes Home for the Holidays When the Midsummer vacation approached , no indecent manifestations of joy were exhibited by the leaden - eyed young gentlemen assembled at Doctor Blimber ’s . Any such violent expression as “
96009	96148	95652	95652	Walter	293	” would have been quite inapplicable to that polite establishment . The young gentlemen oozed away , semi - annually , to their own homes ; but they never broke up . They would have scorned the action . Tozer , who was constantly galled and tormented by a starched white cambric neckerchief , which he wore at the express desire of Mrs Tozer , his parent , who , designing him for the Church , was of opinion that he could n’t be in that forward state of preparation too soon — Tozer said , indeed , that choosing between two evils , he thought he would rather stay where he was , than go home . However inconsistent this declaration might appear with that passage in Tozer ’s Essay on the subject , wherein he had observed “
96172	96693	97094	97094	Ma’am	219	” and had also likened himself to a Roman General , flushed with a recent victory over the Iceni , or laden with Carthaginian spoil , advancing within a few hours ’ march of the Capitol , presupposed , for the purposes of the simile , to be the dwelling - place of Mrs Tozer , still it was very sincerely made . For it seemed that Tozer had a dreadful Uncle , who not only volunteered examinations of him , in the holidays , on abstruse points , but twisted innocent events and things , and wrenched them to the same fell purpose . So that if this Uncle took him to the Play , or , on a similar pretence of kindness , carried him to see a Giant , or a Dwarf , or a Conjuror , or anything , Tozer knew he had read up some classical allusion to the subject beforehand , and was thrown into a state of mortal apprehension : not foreseeing where he might break out , or what authority he might not quote against him . As to Briggs , his father made no show of artifice about it . He never would leave him alone . So numerous and severe were the mental trials of that unfortunate youth in vacation time , that the friends of the family ( then resident near Bayswater , London ) seldom approached the ornamental piece of water in Kensington Gardens , without a vague expectation of seeing Master Briggs ’s hat floating on the surface , and an unfinished exercise lying on the bank . Briggs , therefore , was not at all sanguine on the subject of holidays ; and these two sharers of little Paul ’s bedroom were so fair a sample of the young gentlemen in general , that the most elastic among them contemplated the arrival of those festive periods with genteel resignation . It was far otherwise with little Paul . The end of these first holidays was to witness his separation from Florence , but who ever looked forward to the end of holidays whose beginning was not yet come ! Not Paul , assuredly . As the happy time drew near , the lions and tigers climbing up the bedroom walls became quite tame and frolicsome . The grim sly faces in the squares and diamonds of the floor - cloth , relaxed and peeped out at him with less wicked eyes . The grave old clock had more of personal interest in the tone of its formal inquiry ; and the restless sea went rolling on all night , to the sounding of a melancholy strain — yet it was pleasant too — that rose and fell with the waves , and rocked him , as it were , to sleep . Mr Feeder , B.A. , seemed to think that he , too , would enjoy the holidays very much . Mr Toots projected a life of holidays from that time forth ; for , as he regularly informed Paul every day , it was his “
96696	96875	97094	97094	Ma’am	219	” at Doctor Blimber ’s , and he was going to begin to come into his property directly . It was perfectly understood between Paul and Mr Toots , that they were intimate friends , notwithstanding their distance in point of years and station . As the vacation approached , and Mr Toots breathed harder and stared oftener in Paul ’s society , than he had done before , Paul knew that he meant he was sorry they were going to lose sight of each other , and felt very much obliged to him for his patronage and good opinion . It was even understood by Doctor Blimber , Mrs Blimber , and Miss Blimber , as well as by the young gentlemen in general , that Toots had somehow constituted himself protector and guardian of Dombey , and the circumstance became so notorious , even to Mrs Pipchin , that the good old creature cherished feelings of bitterness and jealousy against Toots ; and , in the sanctuary of her own home , repeatedly denounced him as a “
96881	97077	97078	97078	Dombey	196	” Whereas the innocent Toots had no more idea of awakening Mrs Pipchin ’s wrath , than he had of any other definite possibility or proposition . On the contrary , he was disposed to consider her rather a remarkable character , with many points of interest about her . For this reason he smiled on her with so much urbanity , and asked her how she did , so often , in the course of her visits to little Paul , that at last she one night told him plainly , she was n’t used to it , whatever he might think ; and she could not , and she would not bear it , either from himself or any other puppy then existing : at which unexpected acknowledgment of his civilities , Mr Toots was so alarmed that he secreted himself in a retired spot until she had gone . Nor did he ever again face the doughty Mrs Pipchin , under Doctor Blimber ’s roof . They were within two or three weeks of the holidays , when , one day , Cornelia Blimber called Paul into her room , and said , “
97089	97090	97080	97080	I	0	” “
97096	97100	97092	97092	you	0	” returned Paul . “
97112	97126	97108	97108	you	196	” inquired Miss Blimber , looking hard at him , through the spectacles . “
97131	97135	97129	97129	Ma’am	10816	” said Paul . “
97140	97145	97138	97138	Dombey	196	” said Miss Blimber , “
97176	97177	97178	97179	Mrs Pipchin	307	” “
97189	97193	97178	97179	Mrs Pipchin	307	” returned Paul . “
97212	97217	97218	97218	I	0	” returned Miss Blimber . “
97279	97280	97281	97281	I	0	” “
97288	97293	97281	97281	I	0	” began little Paul . “
97314	97328	97303	97303	you	196	” said Miss Blimber , who preserved an awful politeness in her admonitions . “
97342	97381	97418	97418	Walker	372	” Paul felt it safest to say nothing at all , so he only looked at Miss Blimber ’s spectacles . Miss Blimber having shaken her head at him gravely , referred to a paper lying before her . “
97398	97405	97418	97418	Walker	372	” said Miss Blimber breaking off , “
97459	97486	97418	97418	Walker	372	” Dombey did n’t seem to be absolutely blinded by the light let in upon his intellect , but he made Miss Blimber a little bow . “
97491	97503	97418	97418	Walker	372	” resumed Miss Blimber , casting her eye over the paper , “
97565	97651	97556	97556	Dombey	190	” Miss Blimber paused to see how Paul received this news . Being undecided whether six three - fourths meant six pounds fifteen , or sixpence three farthings , or six foot three , or three quarters past six , or six somethings that he had n’t learnt yet , with three unknown something elses over , Paul rubbed his hands and looked straight at Miss Blimber . It happened to answer as well as anything else he could have done ; and Cornelia proceeded . “
97717	97728	97700	97700	your	190	” Paul set himself to follow it with great care . “
97739	97765	97700	97700	your	190	” said Miss Blimber , reading in a loud voice , and at every second word directing her spectacles towards the little figure before her : “
97855	97865	97867	97867	you	190	” said Miss Blimber , laying down the paper , “
97871	97872	97867	97867	you	190	” “
97880	97884	97875	97875	I	0	” said Paul . “
97893	97898	97878	97878	Ma’am	10816	” Miss Blimber continued , “
97956	98249	97942	97942	you	190	” She touched the child upon a tender point . He had secretly become more and more solicitous from day to day , as the time of his departure drew more near , that all the house should like him . From some hidden reason , very imperfectly understood by himself — if understood at all — he felt a gradually increasing impulse of affection , towards almost everything and everybody in the place . He could not bear to think that they would be quite indifferent to him when he was gone . He wanted them to remember him kindly ; and he had made it his business even to conciliate a great hoarse shaggy dog , chained up at the back of the house , who had previously been the terror of his life : that even he might miss him when he was no longer there . Little thinking that in this , he only showed again the difference between himself and his compeers , poor tiny Paul set it forth to Miss Blimber as well as he could , and begged her , in despite of the official analysis , to have the goodness to try and like him . To Mrs Blimber , who had joined them , he preferred the same petition : and when that lady could not forbear , even in his presence , from giving utterance to her often - repeated opinion , that he was an odd child , Paul told her that he was sure she was quite right ; that he thought it must be his bones , but he did n’t know ; and that he hoped she would overlook it , for he was fond of them all . “
98254	98282	97942	97942	you	190	” said Paul , with a mixture of timidity and perfect frankness , which was one of the most peculiar and most engaging qualities of the child , “
98311	98312	98307	98307	you	2727	” “
98322	98331	98307	98307	you	2727	” cried Mrs Blimber , in a whisper . “
98340	98344	98333	98333	I	0	” pursued Paul , “
98369	98440	98356	98356	anyone	787	” Mrs Blimber was now quite sure that Paul was the oddest child in the world ; and when she told the Doctor what had passed , the Doctor did not controvert his wife ’s opinion . But he said , as he had said before , when Paul first came , that study would do much ; and he also said , as he had said on that occasion , “
98451	99406	98356	98356	anyone	787	” Cornelia had always brought him on as vigorously as she could ; and Paul had had a hard life of it . But over and above the getting through his tasks , he had long had another purpose always present to him , and to which he still held fast . It was , to be a gentle , useful , quiet little fellow , always striving to secure the love and attachment of the rest ; and though he was yet often to be seen at his old post on the stairs , or watching the waves and clouds from his solitary window , he was oftener found , too , among the other boys , modestly rendering them some little voluntary service . Thus it came to pass , that even among those rigid and absorbed young anchorites , who mortified themselves beneath the roof of Doctor Blimber , Paul was an object of general interest ; a fragile little plaything that they all liked , and that no one would have thought of treating roughly . But he could not change his nature , or rewrite the analysis ; and so they all agreed that Dombey was old - fashioned . There were some immunities , however , attaching to the character enjoyed by no one else . They could have better spared a newer - fashioned child , and that alone was much . When the others only bowed to Doctor Blimber and family on retiring for the night , Paul would stretch out his morsel of a hand , and boldly shake the Doctor ’s ; also Mrs Blimber ’s ; also Cornelia ’s . If anybody was to be begged off from impending punishment , Paul was always the delegate . The weak - eyed young man himself had once consulted him , in reference to a little breakage of glass and china . And it was darkly rumoured that the butler , regarding him with favour such as that stern man had never shown before to mortal boy , had sometimes mingled porter with his table - beer to make him strong . Over and above these extensive privileges , Paul had free right of entry to Mr Feeder ’s room , from which apartment he had twice led Mr Toots into the open air in a state of faintness , consequent on an unsuccessful attempt to smoke a very blunt cigar : one of a bundle which that young gentleman had covertly purchased on the shingle from a most desperate smuggler , who had acknowledged , in confidence , that two hundred pounds was the price set upon his head , dead or alive , by the Custom House . It was a snug room , Mr Feeder ’s , with his bed in another little room inside of it ; and a flute , which Mr Feeder could n’t play yet , but was going to make a point of learning , he said , hanging up over the fireplace . There were some books in it , too , and a fishing - rod ; for Mr Feeder said he should certainly make a point of learning to fish , when he could find time . Mr Feeder had amassed , with similar intentions , a beautiful little curly secondhand key - bugle , a chess - board and men , a Spanish Grammar , a set of sketching materials , and a pair of boxing - gloves . The art of self - defence Mr Feeder said he should undoubtedly make a point of learning , as he considered it the duty of every man to do ; for it might lead to the protection of a female in distress . But Mr Feeder ’s great possession was a large green jar of snuff , which Mr Toots had brought down as a present , at the close of the last vacation ; and for which he had paid a high price , having been the genuine property of the Prince Regent . Neither Mr Toots nor Mr Feeder could partake of this or any other snuff , even in the most stinted and moderate degree , without being seized with convulsions of sneezing . Nevertheless it was their great delight to moisten a box - full with cold tea , stir it up on a piece of parchment with a paper - knife , and devote themselves to its consumption then and there . In the course of which cramming of their noses , they endured surprising torments with the constancy of martyrs : and , drinking table - beer at intervals , felt all the glories of dissipation . To little Paul sitting silent in their company , and by the side of his chief patron , Mr Toots , there was a dread charm in these reckless occasions : and when Mr Feeder spoke of the dark mysteries of London , and told Mr Toots that he was going to observe it himself closely in all its ramifications in the approaching holidays , and for that purpose had made arrangements to board with two old maiden ladies at Peckham , Paul regarded him as if he were the hero of some book of travels or wild adventure , and was almost afraid of such a slashing person . Going into this room one evening , when the holidays were very near , Paul found Mr Feeder filling up the blanks in some printed letters , while some others , already filled up and strewn before him , were being folded and sealed by Mr Toots . Mr Feeder said , “
99416	99442	99412	99412	you	196	you?”—for they were always kind to him , and glad to see him — and then said , tossing one of the letters towards him , “
99456	99457	99454	99454	yours	196	” “
99462	99466	99460	99460	Sir	735	” said Paul . “
99470	100062	99467	99467	Your	196	” returned Mr Feeder . Paul , looking at it , found , in copper - plate print , with the exception of his own name and the date , which were in Mr Feeder ’s penmanship , that Doctor and Mrs Blimber requested the pleasure of Mr P. Dombey ’s company at an early party on Wednesday Evening the Seventeenth Instant ; and that the hour was half - past seven o’clock ; and that the object was Quadrilles . Mr Toots also showed him , by holding up a companion sheet of paper , that Doctor and Mrs Blimber requested the pleasure of Mr Toots ’s company at an early party on Wednesday Evening the Seventeenth Instant , when the hour was half - past seven o’clock , and when the object was Quadrilles . He also found , on glancing at the table where Mr Feeder sat , that the pleasure of Mr Briggs ’s company , and of Mr Tozer ’s company , and of every young gentleman ’s company , was requested by Doctor and Mrs Blimber on the same genteel Occasion . Mr Feeder then told him , to his great joy , that his sister was invited , and that it was a half - yearly event , and that , as the holidays began that day , he could go away with his sister after the party , if he liked , which Paul interrupted him to say he would like , very much . Mr Feeder then gave him to understand that he would be expected to inform Doctor and Mrs Blimber , in superfine small - hand , that Mr P. Dombey would be happy to have the honour of waiting on them , in accordance with their polite invitation . Lastly , Mr Feeder said , he had better not refer to the festive occasion , in the hearing of Doctor and Mrs Blimber ; as these preliminaries , and the whole of the arrangements , were conducted on principles of classicality and high breeding ; and that Doctor and Mrs Blimber on the one hand , and the young gentlemen on the other , were supposed , in their scholastic capacities , not to have the least idea of what was in the wind . Paul thanked Mr Feeder for these hints , and pocketing his invitation , sat down on a stool by the side of Mr Toots , as usual . But Paul ’s head , which had long been ailing more or less , and was sometimes very heavy and painful , felt so uneasy that night , that he was obliged to support it on his hand . And yet it dropped so , that by little and little it sunk on Mr Toots ’s knee , and rested there , as if it had no care to be ever lifted up again . That was no reason why he should be deaf ; but he must have been , he thought , for , by and by , he heard Mr Feeder calling in his ear , and gently shaking him to rouse his attention . And when he raised his head , quite scared , and looked about him , he found that Doctor Blimber had come into the room ; and that the window was open , and that his forehead was wet with sprinkled water ; though how all this had been done without his knowledge , was very curious indeed . “
100080	100087	100096	100096	Sir	735	” said Doctor Blimber , encouragingly . “
100098	100456	100096	100096	Sir	735	” said Paul . But there seemed to be something the matter with the floor , for he could n’t stand upon it steadily ; and with the walls too , for they were inclined to turn round and round , and could only be stopped by being looked at very hard indeed . Mr Toots ’s head had the appearance of being at once bigger and farther off than was quite natural ; and when he took Paul in his arms , to carry him upstairs , Paul observed with astonishment that the door was in quite a different place from that in which he had expected to find it , and almost thought , at first , that Mr Toots was going to walk straight up the chimney . It was very kind of Mr Toots to carry him to the top of the house so tenderly ; and Paul told him that it was . But Mr Toots said he would do a great deal more than that , if he could ; and indeed he did more as it was : for he helped Paul to undress , and helped him to bed , in the kindest manner possible , and then sat down by the bedside and chuckled very much ; while Mr Feeder , B.A. , leaning over the bottom of the bedstead , set all the little bristles on his head bolt upright with his bony hands , and then made believe to spar at Paul with great science , on account of his being all right again , which was so uncommonly facetious , and kind too in Mr Feeder , that Paul , not being able to make up his mind whether it was best to laugh or cry at him , did both at once . How Mr Toots melted away , and Mr Feeder changed into Mrs Pipchin , Paul never thought of asking ; neither was he at all curious to know ; but when he saw Mrs Pipchin standing at the bottom of the bed , instead of Mr Feeder , he cried out , “
100465	100466	100457	100458	Mrs Pipchin	307	” “
100477	100495	100475	100475	Paul	192	” said Mrs Pipchin , coming round to the bedside , and sitting down in the chair . “
100499	100503	100475	100475	Paul	192	” said Paul . “
100508	100513	100475	100475	Paul	192	” said Mrs Pipchin . “
100530	100559	100560	100560	I	0	” inquired Paul , turning his face towards her on his pillow , and resting his chin wistfully on his folded hands . Mrs Pipchin could n’t guess . “
100563	100567	100527	100528	Mrs Pipchin	307	” said Paul , “
100614	100615	100609	100609	her	196	” “
100618	100623	100609	100609	her	196	” cried Mrs Pipchin . “
100626	100630	100609	100609	her	196	” said Paul . “
100642	100662	100640	100640	I	0	” He stopped , and pondered for a moment . Mrs Pipchin ’s grey eye scanned his thoughtful face . “
100668	101334	100640	100640	I	0	” said Paul . Then he went on immediately to tell Mrs Pipchin all about the party , about Florence ’s invitation , about the pride he would have in the admiration that would be felt for her by all the boys , about their being so kind to him and fond of him , about his being so fond of them , and about his being so glad of it . Then he told Mrs Pipchin about the analysis , and about his being certainly old - fashioned , and took Mrs Pipchin ’s opinion on that point , and whether she knew why it was , and what it meant . Mrs Pipchin denied the fact altogether , as the shortest way of getting out of the difficulty ; but Paul was far from satisfied with that reply , and looked so searchingly at Mrs Pipchin for a truer answer , that she was obliged to get up and look out of the window to avoid his eyes . There was a certain calm Apothecary , who attended at the establishment when any of the young gentlemen were ill , and somehow he got into the room and appeared at the bedside , with Mrs Blimber . How they came there , or how long they had been there , Paul did n’t know ; but when he saw them , he sat up in bed , and answered all the Apothecary ’s questions at full length , and whispered to him that Florence was not to know anything about it , if he pleased , and that he had set his mind upon her coming to the party . He was very chatty with the Apothecary , and they parted excellent friends . Lying down again with his eyes shut , he heard the Apothecary say , out of the room and quite a long way off — or he dreamed it — that there was a want of vital power ( what was that , Paul wondered ! ) and great constitutional weakness . That as the little fellow had set his heart on parting with his school - mates on the seventeenth , it would be better to indulge the fancy if he grew no worse . That he was glad to hear from Mrs Pipchin , that the little fellow would go to his friends in London on the eighteenth . That he would write to Mr Dombey , when he should have gained a better knowledge of the case , and before that day . That there was no immediate cause for — what ? Paul lost that word . And that the little fellow had a fine mind , but was an old - fashioned boy . What old fashion could that be , Paul wondered with a palpitating heart , that was so visibly expressed in him ; so plainly seen by so many people ! He could neither make it out , nor trouble himself long with the effort . Mrs Pipchin was again beside him , if she had ever been away ( he thought she had gone out with the Doctor , but it was all a dream perhaps ) , and presently a bottle and glass got into her hands magically , and she poured out the contents for him . After that , he had some real good jelly , which Mrs Blimber brought to him herself ; and then he was so well , that Mrs Pipchin went home , at his urgent solicitation , and Briggs and Tozer came to bed . Poor Briggs grumbled terribly about his own analysis , which could hardly have discomposed him more if it had been a chemical process ; but he was very good to Paul , and so was Tozer , and so were all the rest , for they every one looked in before going to bed , and said , “
101342	101343	101337	101337	you	2743	” “
101350	101589	101347	101348	little Dombey	190	” and so forth . After Briggs had got into bed , he lay awake for a long time , still bemoaning his analysis , and saying he knew it was all wrong , and they could n’t have analysed a murderer worse , and — how would Doctor Blimber like it if his pocket - money depended on it ? It was very easy , Briggs said , to make a galley - slave of a boy all the half - year , and then score him up idle ; and to crib two dinners a - week out of his board , and then score him up greedy ; but that was n’t going to be submitted to , he believed , was it ? Oh ! Ah ! Before the weak - eyed young man performed on the gong next morning , he came upstairs to Paul and told him he was to lie still , which Paul very gladly did . Mrs Pipchin reappeared a little before the Apothecary , and a little after the good young woman whom Paul had seen cleaning the stove on that first morning ( how long ago it seemed now ! ) had brought him his breakfast . There was another consultation a long way off , or else Paul dreamed it again ; and then the Apothecary , coming back with Doctor and Mrs Blimber , said : “
101619	101620	101592	101592	I	0	” “
101625	101630	101592	101592	I	0	” said Doctor Blimber . “
101643	101644	101634	101634	you	789	” “
101647	101688	101634	101634	you	789	” said Mrs Blimber . The Apothecary bending down , looked closely into Paul ’s eyes , and felt his head , and his pulse , and his heart , with so much interest and care , that Paul said , “
101694	101695	101692	101692	Sir	735	” “
101700	101705	101692	101692	Sir	735	” observed Doctor Blimber , “
101710	101711	101692	101692	Sir	735	” “
101715	101720	101692	101692	Sir	735	” replied the Apothecary . “
101728	101729	101721	101721	He	11188	” “
101736	101741	101730	101730	You	0	” said Doctor Blimber . “
101751	101982	101749	101749	Sir	735	” returned the Apothecary . Paul had begun to speculate , in his own odd way , on the subject that might occupy the Apothecary ’s mind just at that moment ; so musingly had he answered the two questions of Doctor Blimber . But the Apothecary happening to meet his little patient ’s eyes , as the latter set off on that mental expedition , and coming instantly out of his abstraction with a cheerful smile , Paul smiled in return and abandoned it . He lay in bed all that day , dozing and dreaming , and looking at Mr Toots ; but got up on the next , and went downstairs . Lo and behold , there was something the matter with the great clock ; and a workman on a pair of steps had taken its face off , and was poking instruments into the works by the light of a candle ! This was a great event for Paul , who sat down on the bottom stair , and watched the operation attentively : now and then glancing at the clock face , leaning all askew , against the wall hard by , and feeling a little confused by a suspicion that it was ogling him . The workman on the steps was very civil ; and as he said , when he observed Paul , “
101990	102228	101985	101985	you	2750	” Paul got into conversation with him , and told him he had n’t been quite well lately . The ice being thus broken , Paul asked him a multitude of questions about chimes and clocks : as , whether people watched up in the lonely church steeples by night to make them strike , and how the bells were rung when people died , and whether those were different bells from wedding bells , or only sounded dismal in the fancies of the living . Finding that his new acquaintance was not very well informed on the subject of the Curfew Bell of ancient days , Paul gave him an account of that institution ; and also asked him , as a practical man , what he thought about King Alfred ’s idea of measuring time by the burning of candles ; to which the workman replied , that he thought it would be the ruin of the clock trade if it was to come up again . In fine , Paul looked on , until the clock had quite recovered its familiar aspect , and resumed its sedate inquiry ; when the workman , putting away his tools in a long basket , bade him good day , and went away . Though not before he had whispered something , on the door - mat , to the footman , in which there was the phrase “
102231	103250	101749	101749	Sir	735	fashioned”—for Paul heard it . What could that old fashion be , that seemed to make the people sorry ! What could it be ! Having nothing to learn now , he thought of this frequently ; though not so often as he might have done , if he had had fewer things to think of . But he had a great many ; and was always thinking , all day long . First , there was Florence coming to the party . Florence would see that the boys were fond of him ; and that would make her happy . This was his great theme . Let Florence once be sure that they were gentle and good to him , and that he had become a little favourite among them , and then she would always think of the time he had passed there , without being very sorry . Florence might be all the happier too for that , perhaps , when he came back . When he came back ! Fifty times a day , his noiseless little feet went up the stairs to his own room , as he collected every book , and scrap , and trifle that belonged to him , and put them all together there , down to the minutest thing , for taking home ! There was no shade of coming back on little Paul ; no preparation for it , or other reference to it , grew out of anything he thought or did , except this slight one in connexion with his sister . On the contrary , he had to think of everything familiar to him , in his contemplative moods and in his wanderings about the house , as being to be parted with ; and hence the many things he had to think of , all day long . He had to peep into those rooms upstairs , and think how solitary they would be when he was gone , and wonder through how many silent days , weeks , months , and years , they would continue just as grave and undisturbed . He had to think — would any other child ( old - fashioned , like himself ) stray there at any time , to whom the same grotesque distortions of pattern and furniture would manifest themselves ; and would anybody tell that boy of little Dombey , who had been there once ? He had to think of a portrait on the stairs , which always looked earnestly after him as he went away , eyeing it over his shoulder ; and which , when he passed it in the company of anyone , still seemed to gaze at him , and not at his companion . He had much to think of , in association with a print that hung up in another place , where , in the centre of a wondering group , one figure that he knew , a figure with a light about its head — benignant , mild , and merciful — stood pointing upward . At his own bedroom window , there were crowds of thoughts that mixed with these , and came on , one upon another , like the rolling waves . Where those wild birds lived , that were always hovering out at sea in troubled weather ; where the clouds rose and first began ; whence the wind issued on its rushing flight , and where it stopped ; whether the spot where he and Florence had so often sat , and watched , and talked about these things , could ever be exactly as it used to be without them ; whether it could ever be the same to Florence , if he were in some distant place , and she were sitting there alone . He had to think , too , of Mr Toots , and Mr Feeder , B.A. , of all the boys ; and of Doctor Blimber , Mrs Blimber , and Miss Blimber ; of home , and of his aunt and Miss Tox ; of his father ; Dombey and Son , Walter with the poor old Uncle who had got the money he wanted , and that gruff - voiced Captain with the iron hand . Besides all this , he had a number of little visits to pay , in the course of the day ; to the schoolroom , to Doctor Blimber ’s study , to Mrs Blimber ’s private apartment , to Miss Blimber ’s , and to the dog . For he was free of the whole house now , to range it as he chose ; and , in his desire to part with everybody on affectionate terms , he attended , in his way , to them all . Sometimes he found places in books for Briggs , who was always losing them ; sometimes he looked up words in dictionaries for other young gentlemen who were in extremity ; sometimes he held skeins of silk for Mrs Blimber to wind ; sometimes he put Cornelia ’s desk to rights ; sometimes he would even creep into the Doctor ’s study , and , sitting on the carpet near his learned feet , turn the globes softly , and go round the world , or take a flight among the far - off stars . In those days immediately before the holidays , in short , when the other young gentlemen were labouring for dear life through a general resumption of the studies of the whole half - year , Paul was such a privileged pupil as had never been seen in that house before . He could hardly believe it himself ; but his liberty lasted from hour to hour , and from day to day ; and little Dombey was caressed by everyone . Doctor Blimber was so particular about him , that he requested Johnson to retire from the dinner - table one day , for having thoughtlessly spoken to him as “
103255	103402	101749	101749	Sir	735	” which Paul thought rather hard and severe , though he had flushed at the moment , and wondered why Johnson should pity him . It was the more questionable justice , Paul thought , in the Doctor , from his having certainly overheard that great authority give his assent on the previous evening , to the proposition ( stated by Mrs Blimber ) that poor dear little Dombey was more old - fashioned than ever . And now it was that Paul began to think it must surely be old - fashioned to be very thin , and light , and easily tired , and soon disposed to lie down anywhere and rest ; for he could n’t help feeling that these were more and more his habits every day . At last the party - day arrived ; and Doctor Blimber said at breakfast , “
103419	103448	103449	103449	Blimber	336	” Mr Toots immediately threw off his allegiance , and put on his ring : and mentioning the Doctor in casual conversation shortly afterwards , spoke of him as “
103450	103619	101749	101749	Sir	735	” ! This act of freedom inspired the older pupils with admiration and envy ; but the younger spirits were appalled , and seemed to marvel that no beam fell down and crushed him . Not the least allusion was made to the ceremonies of the evening , either at breakfast or at dinner ; but there was a bustle in the house all day , and in the course of his perambulations , Paul made acquaintance with various strange benches and candlesticks , and met a harp in a green greatcoat standing on the landing outside the drawing - room door . There was something queer , too , about Mrs Blimber ’s head at dinner - time , as if she had screwed her hair up too tight ; and though Miss Blimber showed a graceful bunch of plaited hair on each temple , she seemed to have her own little curls in paper underneath , and in a play - bill too ; for Paul read “
103622	103631	103449	103449	Blimber	336	” over one of her sparkling spectacles , and “
103633	103882	103449	103449	Blimber	336	” over the other . There was a grand array of white waistcoats and cravats in the young gentlemen ’s bedrooms as evening approached ; and such a smell of singed hair , that Doctor Blimber sent up the footman with his compliments , and wished to know if the house was on fire . But it was only the hairdresser curling the young gentlemen , and over - heating his tongs in the ardour of business . When Paul was dressed — which was very soon done , for he felt unwell and drowsy , and was not able to stand about it very long — he went down into the drawing - room ; where he found Doctor Blimber pacing up and down the room full dressed , but with a dignified and unconcerned demeanour , as if he thought it barely possible that one or two people might drop in by and by . Shortly afterwards , Mrs Blimber appeared , looking lovely , Paul thought ; and attired in such a number of skirts that it was quite an excursion to walk round her . Miss Blimber came down soon after her Mama ; a little squeezed in appearance , but very charming . Mr Toots and Mr Feeder were the next arrivals . Each of these gentlemen brought his hat in his hand , as if he lived somewhere else ; and when they were announced by the butler , Doctor Blimber said , “
103894	103949	103449	103449	Blimber	336	” and seemed extremely glad to see them . Mr Toots was one blaze of jewellery and buttons ; and he felt the circumstance so strongly , that when he had shaken hands with the Doctor , and had bowed to Mrs Blimber and Miss Blimber , he took Paul aside , and said , “
103959	104254	104255	104256	Cook ’em	2756	” But notwithstanding this modest confidence in himself , Mr Toots appeared to be involved in a good deal of uncertainty whether , on the whole , it was judicious to button the bottom button of his waistcoat , and whether , on a calm revision of all the circumstances , it was best to wear his waistbands turned up or turned down . Observing that Mr Feeder ’s were turned up , Mr Toots turned his up ; but the waistbands of the next arrival being turned down , Mr Toots turned his down . The differences in point of waistcoat - buttoning , not only at the bottom , but at the top too , became so numerous and complicated as the arrivals thickened , that Mr Toots was continually fingering that article of dress , as if he were performing on some instrument ; and appeared to find the incessant execution it demanded , quite bewildering . All the young gentlemen , tightly cravatted , curled , and pumped , and with their best hats in their hands , having been at different times announced and introduced , Mr Baps , the dancing - master , came , accompanied by Mrs Baps , to whom Mrs Blimber was extremely kind and condescending . Mr Baps was a very grave gentleman , with a slow and measured manner of speaking ; and before he had stood under the lamp five minutes , he began to talk to Toots ( who had been silently comparing pumps with him ) about what you were to do with your raw materials when they came into your ports in return for your drain of gold . Mr Toots , to whom the question seemed perplexing , suggested “
104258	104423	104255	104256	Cook ’em	2756	” But Mr Baps did not appear to think that would do . Paul now slipped away from the cushioned corner of a sofa , which had been his post of observation , and went downstairs into the tea - room to be ready for Florence , whom he had not seen for nearly a fortnight , as he had remained at Doctor Blimber ’s on the previous Saturday and Sunday , lest he should take cold . Presently she came : looking so beautiful in her simple ball dress , with her fresh flowers in her hand , that when she knelt down on the ground to take Paul round the neck and kiss him ( for there was no one there , but his friend and another young woman waiting to serve out the tea ) , he could hardly make up his mind to let her go again , or to take away her bright and loving eyes from his face . “
104432	104445	104430	104430	Floy	196	” asked Paul , almost sure that he saw a tear there . “
104452	104471	104430	104430	Floy	196	” returned Florence . Paul touched her cheek gently with his finger — and it was a tear ! “
104476	104480	104474	104474	Floy	196	” said he . “
104495	104499	104500	104500	Nurse	2029	” said Florence . “
104503	104553	104500	104500	Nurse	2029	” echoed Paul . Paul could n’t understand what that had to do with it , nor why the two young women looked on so seriously , nor why Florence turned away her face for a moment , and then turned it back , lighted up again with smiles . “
104556	104571	104554	104554	Floy	196	” said Paul , holding a ringlet of her dark hair in his hand . “
104587	104599	104578	104578	you	9979	” His sister laughed , and fondled him , and told him “
104602	104603	104578	104578	you	9979	” “
104611	104615	104607	104607	they	2762	” returned Paul , “
104627	104776	104625	104625	Floy	196	” But a loud double knock coming at the door , and Florence hurrying to the table , there was no more said between them . Paul wondered again when he saw his friend whisper to Florence , as if she were comforting her ; but a new arrival put that out of his head speedily . It was Sir Barnet Skettles , Lady Skettles , and Master Skettles . Master Skettles was to be a new boy after the vacation , and Fame had been busy , in Mr Feeder ’s room , with his father , who was in the House of Commons , and of whom Mr Feeder had said that when he did catch the Speaker ’s eye ( which he had been expected to do for three or four years ) , it was anticipated that he would rather touch up the Radicals . “
104787	104796	104797	104797	Melia	363	” said Lady Skettles to Paul ’s friend , “
104799	104807	104864	104865	Lady Skettles	379	“ Doctor Blimber ’s study , Ma’am , ”
104837	104841	104827	104829	Sir Barnet Skettles	378	“ Very good . ”
104854	104862	104864	104865	Lady Skettles	379	“ And this little creature , now , ”
104871	104878	104864	104865	Lady Skettles	379	“ Is he one of the — ”
104879	104889	104891	104891	Paul	192	“ Young gentlemen , Ma’am ; yes , Ma’am , ”
104895	104906	104908	104909	Lady Skettles	379	“ And what is your name , my pale child ? ”
104911	104914	104916	104916	Paul	192	“ Dombey , ”
104960	104973	104954	104954	him	378	“ City — very rich — most respectable — Doctor mentioned it . ”
104981	105008	104976	104976	he	378	“ Will you tell your good Papa that Sir Barnet Skettles rejoiced to hear that he was very well , and sent him his best compliments ? ”
105009	105014	105016	105016	Paul	192	“ Yes , Sir , ”
105018	105025	105027	105029	Sir Barnet Skettles	378	“ That is my brave boy , ”
105031	105034	105027	105029	Sir Barnet Skettles	378	“ Barnet , ”
105055	105077	105079	105081	Sir Barnet Skettles	378	“ this is a young gentleman you ought to know . This is a young gentleman you may know , Barnet , ”
105090	105102	105104	105105	Lady Skettles	379	“ What eyes ! What hair ! What a lovely face ! ”
105117	105121	105123	105123	Paul	192	“ My sister , ”
105844	105845	105838	105838	he	376	” “
105856	105862	105838	105838	he	376	” observed Sir Barnet Skettles . “

105907	105944	105945	105945	Paul	192	” said Doctor Blimber , yes , but not of that sort . Mr Baps is a very worthy sort of man , Sir Barnet , and — in fact he ’s our Professor of dancing . ”

106671	106675	106680	106682	all the boys	11272	“ Dombey ’s sister ”
107172	107180	107182	107182	Paul	192	“ Good - bye , Doctor Blimber , ”
107189	107198	107200	107201	the Doctor	9751	“ Good - bye , my little friend , ”
107203	107214	107216	107216	Paul	192	“ I ’m very much obliged to you , Sir , ”
107226	107239	107216	107216	Paul	192	“ Ask them to take care of Diogenes , if you please . ”
107337	107354	107325	107325	Cornelia	345	“ Dombey , Dombey , you have always been my favourite pupil . God bless you ! ”
107399	107404	107394	107396	the young gentlemen	11130	“ Dombey ’s going ! ”
107405	107411	107394	107396	the young gentlemen	11130	“ Little Dombey ’s going ! ”
107589	107597	107615	107615	Florence	196	“ Dombey , do n’t forget me ! ”
107836	107841	107875	107875	he	192	“ Is Dombey there ? ”
107902	107907	107875	107875	he	192	“ Is Dombey there ? ”
108062	108075	108055	108055	he	192	“ Oh Floy , take me home , and never leave me ! ”
108091	108102	108088	108088	himself	192	“ Take me home , Floy ! take me home ! ”
108196	108208	108209	108209	he	192	“ I want to speak to Florence , if you please , ”
108212	108222	108209	108209	he	192	“ To Florence by herself , for a moment ! ”
108235	108257	108223	108223	She	196	“ Floy , my pet , was n’t that Papa in the hall , when they brought me from the coach ? ”
108258	108263	108291	108291	her	196	“ Yes , dear . ”
108264	108288	108289	108289	Florence	196	“ He did n’t cry , and go into his room , Floy , did he , when he saw me coming in ? ”
108302	108312	108314	108315	little Paul	192	“ I ’m very glad he did n’t cry , ”
108317	108331	108314	108315	little Paul	192	“ I thought he did . Do n’t tell them that I asked . ”
108994	109009	109011	109011	Walter	293	“ Well ! at last and at least , Uncle Sol must be told , ”
109507	109510	109514	109515	the Captain	10100	“ Stinger , ”
109538	109541	109544	109545	the Captain	10100	“ Cuttle , ”
109598	109599	109553	109554	the Captain	10100	“ Wal”r
109601	109613	109553	109554	the Captain	10100	” cried the Captain , looking down upon him in amazement . “
109621	109625	109627	109627	me	0	” returned Walter , “
109628	109629	109553	109554	the Captain	10100	” “
109638	109647	109635	109636	my lad	1268	” inquired the Captain , with great concern . “
109656	109657	109627	109627	me	0	” “
109662	109666	109627	109627	me	0	” said Walter . “
109676	109699	109673	109674	Captain Cuttle	250	” The Captain expressed his gratification , and said he would come down below and open the door , which he did . “
109705	109707	109709	109710	the Captain	10100	Wal”r , ”
109722	109732	109734	109734	Walter	293	“ Why , the fact is , Captain Cuttle , ”
109739	109759	109734	109734	Walter	293	“ I was afraid you would have gone out , and I want to benefit by your friendly counsel . ”
109760	109765	109767	109768	the Captain	10100	“ So you shall , ”
109770	109776	109767	109768	the Captain	10100	“ what ’ll you take ? ”
109777	109788	109790	109790	Walter	293	“ I want to take your opinion , Captain Cuttle , ”
109794	109803	109790	109790	Walter	293	“ That ’s the only thing for me . ”
109804	109809	109811	109812	the Captain	10100	“ Come on then , ”
109814	109822	109811	109812	the Captain	10100	“ With a will , my lad ! ”
109913	109920	109922	109922	Walter	293	“ You see , Captain Cuttle , ”
109924	110023	109922	109922	Walter	293	“ for myself , I am young , as Mr Dombey said , and not to be considered . I am to fight my way through the world , I know ; but there are two points I was thinking , as I came along , that I should be very particular about , in respect to my Uncle . I do n’t mean to say that I deserve to be the pride and delight of his life — you believe me , I know — but I am . Now , do n’t you think I am ? ”
110065	110074	110076	110076	Walter	293	“ If I live and have my health , ”
110078	110121	110076	110076	Walter	293	“ and I am not afraid of that , still , when I leave England I can hardly hope to see my Uncle again . He is old , Captain Cuttle ; and besides , his life is a life of custom — ”
110122	110125	110053	110055	the glazed hat	2893	“ Steady , Wal”r
110133	110141	110076	110076	Walter	293	” said the Captain , suddenly reappearing . “
110145	110153	110076	110076	Walter	293	” returned Walter , shaking his head : “
110226	110227	110213	110213	you	250	” “
110232	110237	110213	110213	you	250	” interposed the Captain . “
110240	110241	110213	110213	you	250	” “
110245	110254	110213	110213	you	250	” said Walter , trying to speak gaily , “
110356	110357	110379	110379	you	250	” “
110366	110376	110379	110379	you	250	” observed the Captain , in a contemplative voice . “
110385	110389	110379	110379	you	250	” inquired Walter . “
110393	110426	110379	110379	you	250	” returned the Captain , thoughtfully . Walter paused to ascertain if the Captain had any particular information to add to this , but as he said no more , went on . “
110645	110646	110648	110649	my boy	10022	“ Wal”r
110651	110656	110648	110649	my boy	10022	” replied the Captain , “
110695	110738	110648	110649	my boy	10022	” Here the Captain stretched out his hand to Walter , with an air of downright good faith that spoke volumes ; at the same time repeating ( for he felt proud of the accuracy and pointed application of his quotation ) , “
110747	110748	110648	110649	my boy	10022	” “
110752	110993	110749	110750	Captain Cuttle	250	” said Walter , taking the immense fist extended to him by the Captain in both his hands , which it completely filled , next to my Uncle Sol , I love you . There is no one on earth in whom I can more safely trust , I am sure . As to the mere going away , Captain Cuttle , I do n’t care for that ; why should I care for that ! If I were free to seek my own fortune — if I were free to go as a common sailor — if I were free to venture on my own account to the farthest end of the world — I would gladly go ! I would have gladly gone , years ago , and taken my chance of what might come of it . But it was against my Uncle ’s wishes , and against the plans he had formed for me ; and there was an end of that . But what I feel , Captain Cuttle , is that we have been a little mistaken all along , and that , so far as any improvement in my prospects is concerned , I am no better off now than I was when I first entered Dombey ’s House — perhaps a little worse , for the House may have been kindly inclined towards me then , and it certainly is not now . ”
110994	111000	111002	111004	the disconsolate Captain	2907	“ Turn again , Whittington , ”
111014	111017	111019	111019	Walter	293	“ Ay , ”
111023	111055	111056	111056	he	2907	“ and turn a great many times , too , Captain Cuttle , I ’m afraid , before such fortune as his ever turns up again . Not that I complain , ”
111068	111244	111056	111056	he	2907	“ I have nothing to complain of . I am provided for . I can live . When I leave my Uncle , I leave him to you ; and I can leave him to no one better , Captain Cuttle . I have n’t told you all this because I despair , not I ; it ’s to convince you that I ca n’t pick and choose in Dombey ’s House , and that where I am sent , there I must go , and what I am offered , that I must take . It ’s better for my Uncle that I should be sent away ; for Mr Dombey is a valuable friend to him , as he proved himself , you know when , Captain Cuttle ; and I am persuaded he wo n’t be less valuable when he has n’t me there , every day , to awaken his dislike . So hurrah for the West Indies , Captain Cuttle ! How does that tune go that the sailors sing ? “
111265	111273	111282	111282	i	0	” Here the Captain roared in chorus — “
111286	111357	111282	111282	i	0	” The last line reaching the quick ears of an ardent skipper not quite sober , who lodged opposite , and who instantly sprung out of bed , threw up his window , and joined in , across the street , at the top of his voice , produced a fine effect . When it was impossible to sustain the concluding note any longer , the skipper bellowed forth a terrific “
111360	111397	111282	111282	i	0	” intended in part as a friendly greeting , and in part to show that he was not at all breathed . That done , he shut down his window , and went to bed again . “
111404	111421	111401	111402	Captain Cuttle	250	” said Walter , handing him the blue coat and waistcoat , and bustling very much , “
111468	111672	111450	111450	I	0	” The Captain , however , scarcely appeared to relish the commission , or to be by any means confident of his powers of executing it . He had arranged the future life and adventures of Walter so very differently , and so entirely to his own satisfaction ; he had felicitated himself so often on the sagacity and foresight displayed in that arrangement , and had found it so complete and perfect in all its parts ; that to suffer it to go to pieces all at once , and even to assist in breaking it up , required a great effort of his resolution . The Captain , too , found it difficult to unload his old ideas upon the subject , and to take a perfectly new cargo on board , with that rapidity which the circumstances required , or without jumbling and confounding the two . Consequently , instead of putting on his coat and waistcoat with anything like the impetuosity that could alone have kept pace with Walter ’s mood , he declined to invest himself with those garments at all at present ; and informed Walter that on such a serious matter , he must be allowed to “
111678	111680	111693	111694	the Captain	10100	” . “
111689	111691	111693	111694	the Captain	10100	Wal”r , ”
111696	111712	111693	111694	the Captain	10100	“ any time these fifty year . When you see Ned Cuttle bite his nails , Wal”r
111724	111782	111719	111720	Ned Cuttle	392	” [ Illustration ] Thereupon the Captain put his iron hook between his teeth , as if it were a hand ; and with an air of wisdom and profundity that was the very concentration and sublimation of all philosophical reflection and grave inquiry , applied himself to the consideration of the subject in its various branches . “
111790	111800	111802	111802	he	2914	” murmured the Captain , in an absent manner , “
111845	111850	111842	111843	that man	2915	” said the Captain , “
111895	111940	111942	111942	you	2918	” In spite of his respect for Captain Cuttle , Walter could not help inwardly rejoicing at the absence of this sage , and devoutly hoping that his limpid intellect might not be brought to bear on his difficulties until they were quite settled . “
111956	111965	111942	111942	you	2918	” said Captain Cuttle in the same tone , “
111974	112020	111942	111942	you	2918	Wal”r , he ’d give you an opinion that was no more like that buoy than your Uncle ’s buttons are . There ai n’t a man that walks — certainly not on two legs — that can come near him . Not near him ! ”
112021	112030	112032	112032	Walter	293	“ What ’s his name , Captain Cuttle ? ”
112044	112050	112052	112053	the Captain	10100	“ His name ’s Bunsby , ”
112055	112076	112052	112053	the Captain	10100	“ But Lord , it might be anything for the matter of that , with such a mind as his ! ”
112287	112299	112301	112302	the Captain	10100	“ Or if there should be any little hitch between ’em , ”
112311	112339	112301	112302	the Captain	10100	“ it only wants a word in season from a friend of both parties , to set it right and smooth , and make all taut again . ”
112463	112477	112478	112479	Mr Dombey	190	“ Would ye be so good , my lad , as report Cap’en Cuttle here?”—meet
112670	112673	112664	112664	his	10100	“ Now , Wal”r
112687	113007	112659	112660	the Captain	10100	” By which the Captain meant his coat and waistcoat . Walter little imagined why the Captain was so particular in the arrangement of his cravat , as to twist the pendent ends into a sort of pigtail , and pass them through a massive gold ring with a picture of a tomb upon it , and a neat iron railing , and a tree , in memory of some deceased friend . Nor why the Captain pulled up his shirt - collar to the utmost limits allowed by the Irish linen below , and by so doing decorated himself with a complete pair of blinkers ; nor why he changed his shoes , and put on an unparalleled pair of ankle - jacks , which he only wore on extraordinary occasions . The Captain being at length attired to his own complete satisfaction , and having glanced at himself from head to foot in a shaving - glass which he removed from a nail for that purpose , took up his knotted stick , and said he was ready . The Captain ’s walk was more complacent than usual when they got out into the street ; but this Walter supposed to be the effect of the ankle - jacks , and took little heed of . Before they had gone very far , they encountered a woman selling flowers ; when the Captain stopping short , as if struck by a happy idea , made a purchase of the largest bundle in her basket : a most glorious nosegay , fan - shaped , some two feet and a half round , and composed of all the jolliest - looking flowers that blow . Armed with this little token which he designed for Mr Dombey , Captain Cuttle walked on with Walter until they reached the Instrument - maker ’s door , before which they both paused . “
113013	113017	113114	113115	the Captain	10100	” said Walter . “
113020	113055	113114	113115	the Captain	10100	” returned the Captain , who felt that Walter must be got rid of before he proceeded any further , and that he had better time his projected visit somewhat later in the day . “
113063	113064	113114	113115	the Captain	10100	” “
113067	113072	113114	113115	the Captain	10100	” returned the Captain . “
113082	113086	113073	113073	I	0	” said Walter , “
113100	113101	113097	113098	Captain Cuttle	392	” “

114119	114132	114134	114134	Walter	293	“ Do you want to go to Staggs ’s Gardens , Susan ? ”
114136	114149	114151	114152	the coachman	2826	“ Ah ! She wants to go there ! WHERE IS IT ? ”

114169	114289	114165	114165	Susan	241	“ Mr Walter , I was there once myself , along with Miss Floy and our poor darling Master Paul , on the very day when you found Miss Floy in the City , for we lost her coming home , Mrs Richards and me , and a mad bull , and Mrs Richards ’s eldest , and though I went there afterwards , I ca n’t remember where it is , I think it ’s sunk into the ground . Oh , Mr Walter , do n’t desert me , Staggs ’s Gardens , if you please ! Miss Floy ’s darling — all our darlings — little , meek , meek Master Paul ! Oh Mr Walter ! ”
114290	114294	114296	114296	Walter	293	“ Good God ! ”

116515	116525	116509	116509	he	192	“ It is bearing me away , I think ! ”
116557	116573	116574	116574	They	3077	“ You are always watching me , Floy , let me watch you , now ! ”
116940	116943	116944	116944	he	192	“ Floy ! ”
116947	116952	116944	116944	he	192	“ What is that ? ”
116953	116958	116980	116981	The figure	3089	“ Where , dearest ? ”
116959	116969	116980	116981	The figure	3089	“ There ! at the bottom of the bed . ”
116970	116979	116980	116981	The figure	3089	“ There ’s nothing there , except Papa ! ”
116998	117009	116980	116981	The figure	3089	“ My own boy ! Do n’t you know me ? ”
117133	117150	117128	117128	he	192	“ Do n’t be sorry for me , dear Papa ! Indeed I am quite happy ! ”
117218	117232	117214	117214	he	192	“ Do n’t be sorry for me ! Indeed I am quite happy ! ”
117460	117469	117440	117440	they	3107	“ Floy , did I ever see Mama ? ”
117470	117477	117440	117440	they	3107	“ No , darling , why ? ”
117478	117502	117503	117503	He	192	“ Did I ever see any kind face , like Mama ’s , looking at me when I was a baby , Floy ? ”
117520	117526	117503	117503	He	192	“ Oh yes , dear ! ”
117527	117532	117440	117440	they	3107	“ Whose , Floy ? ”
117533	117541	117440	117440	they	3107	“ Your old nurse ’s . Often . ”
117542	117550	117552	117552	Paul	192	“ And where is my old nurse ? ”
117554	117570	117552	117552	Paul	192	“ Is she dead too ? Floy , are we all dead , except you ? ”
117624	117637	117618	117618	Her	197	“ Show me that old nurse , Floy , if you please ! ”
117638	117653	117618	117618	Her	197	“ She is not here , darling . She shall come to - morrow . ”
117654	117660	117661	117661	Paul	192	“ Thank you , Floy ! ”
117723	117734	117720	117720	he	192	“ Floy , is it tomorrow ? Is she come ? ”
117861	117873	117875	117876	the child	716	“ And who is this ? Is this my old nurse ? ”
117983	117993	117995	117995	Paul	192	“ Floy ! this is a kind good face ! ”
117997	118017	117995	117995	Paul	192	“ I am glad to see it again . Do n’t go away , old nurse ! Stay here . ”
118032	118043	118044	118044	he	192	“ Who was that , who said ‘ Walter ’ ? ”
118050	118068	118044	118044	he	192	“ Someone said Walter . Is he here ? I should like to see him very much . ”
118081	118093	118079	118079	Susan	241	“ Call him back , then : let him come up ! ”
118165	118170	118157	118157	he	192	“ Good - bye ! ”
118171	118179	118181	118182	Mrs Pipchin	307	“ Good - bye , my child ! ”
118191	118197	118181	118182	Mrs Pipchin	307	“ Not good - bye ? ”
118226	118229	118230	118230	he	192	“ Yes , ”
118234	118244	118245	118245	his	9730	“ good - bye ! Walter dear , good - bye!”—turning
118259	118264	118265	118265	He	9730	“ Where is Papa ? ”
118284	118291	118292	118292	he	9730	“ Remember Walter , dear Papa , ”
118300	118310	118292	118292	he	9730	“ Remember Walter . I was fond of Walter ! ”
118323	118328	118292	118292	he	9730	“ good - bye ! ”
118334	118340	118341	118341	he	9730	“ Now lay me down , ”
118344	118360	118341	118341	he	9730	“ and , Floy , come close to me , and let me see you ! ”
118387	118422	118424	118424	he	9730	“ How fast the river runs , between its green banks and the rushes , Floy ! But it ’s very near the sea . I hear the waves ! They always said so ! ”
118530	118574	118521	118521	him	9730	“ Mama is like you , Floy . I know her by the face ! But tell them that the print upon the stairs at school is not divine enough . The light about the head is shining on me as I go ! ”
118684	118694	118696	118697	Miss Tox	208	“ Dear me , dear me ! To think , ”
118712	118724	118696	118697	Miss Tox	208	“ that Dombey and Son should be a Daughter after all ! ”
118903	118907	118874	118874	he	392	“ look up again ”
119384	119387	119340	119341	Ned Cuttle	392	“ stand by ”
119940	119951	119952	119952	he	293	“ But I ’m behind the time , you understand , ”
119990	120019	120020	120020	he	293	“ and I would rather have my dear boy here . It ’s an old - fashioned notion , I daresay . He was always fond of the sea He’s”—and
120024	120030	120020	120020	he	293	Walter—“he ’s glad to go . ”
120031	120035	120037	120037	Walter	293	“ Uncle Sol ! ”
120041	120099	120037	120037	Walter	293	“ if you say that , I wo n’t go . No , Captain Cuttle , I wo n’t . If my Uncle thinks I could be glad to leave him , though I was going to be made Governor of all the Islands in the West Indies , that ’s enough . I ’m a fixture . ”
120100	120101	120103	120104	my lad	1268	“ Wal”r
120106	120111	120112	120112	Steady	402	” said the Captain . “
120124	120145	120114	120115	Sol Gills	248	” Following with his eyes the majestic action of the Captain ’s hook , the old man looked at Walter . “
120152	120170	120221	120222	The Gills	248	” said the Captain , with a magnificent sense of the allegory into which he was soaring , “
120198	120218	120221	120222	The Gills	248	” said the Captain , raising his voice as much as to say , observe the point of this , “
120224	120225	120226	120226	Ned	392	” “
120228	120248	120249	120249	I	0	” said the old man , drawing Walter to his side , and taking his arm tenderly through his , “
120348	120362	120342	120342	you	392	” said the old man , looking anxiously from one to the other . “
120406	120425	120427	120427	you	392	” said the old man , fastening on the Captain , to the manifest confusion of that diplomatist ; “
120461	121001	120453	120453	you	392	” As it was a contest of affection and self - denial , Walter struck in with infinite effect , to the Captain ’s relief ; and between them they tolerably reconciled old Sol Gills , by continued talking , to the project ; or rather so confused him , that nothing , not even the pain of separation , was distinctly clear to his mind . He had not much time to balance the matter ; for on the very next day , Walter received from Mr Carker the Manager , the necessary credentials for his passage and outfit , together with the information that the Son and Heir would sail in a fortnight , or within a day or two afterwards at latest . In the hurry of preparation : which Walter purposely enhanced as much as possible : the old man lost what little self - possession he ever had ; and so the time of departure drew on rapidly . The Captain , who did not fail to make himself acquainted with all that passed , through inquiries of Walter from day to day , found the time still tending on towards his going away , without any occasion offering itself , or seeming likely to offer itself , for a better understanding of his position . It was after much consideration of this fact , and much pondering over such an unfortunate combination of circumstances , that a bright idea occurred to the Captain . Suppose he made a call on Mr Carker , and tried to find out from him how the land really lay ! Captain Cuttle liked this idea very much . It came upon him in a moment of inspiration , as he was smoking an early pipe in Brig Place after breakfast ; and it was worthy of the tobacco . It would quiet his conscience , which was an honest one , and was made a little uneasy by what Walter had confided to him , and what Sol Gills had said ; and it would be a deep , shrewd act of friendship . He would sound Mr Carker carefully , and say much or little , just as he read that gentleman ’s character , and discovered that they got on well together or the reverse . Accordingly , without the fear of Walter before his eyes ( who he knew was at home packing ) , Captain Cuttle again assumed his ankle - jacks and mourning brooch , and issued forth on this second expedition . He purchased no propitiatory nosegay on the present occasion , as he was going to a place of business ; but he put a small sunflower in his button - hole to give himself an agreeable relish of the country ; and with this , and the knobby stick , and the glazed hat , bore down upon the offices of Dombey and Son . After taking a glass of warm rum - and - water at a tavern close by , to collect his thoughts , the Captain made a rush down the court , lest its good effects should evaporate , and appeared suddenly to Mr Perch . “
121004	121013	121002	121002	Matey	403	” said the Captain , in persuasive accents . “
121022	121056	121020	121020	Carker	274	” Mr Perch admitted it ; but gave him to understand , as in official duty bound , that all his Governors were engaged , and never expected to be disengaged any more . “
121062	121070	121060	121060	mate	3190	” said the Captain in his ear ; “
121077	121132	121074	121075	Cap’en Cuttle	394	” The Captain would have hooked Perch gently to him , but Mr Perch eluded the attempt ; not so much in design , as in starting at the sudden thought that such a weapon unexpectedly exhibited to Mrs Perch might , in her then condition , be destructive to that lady ’s hopes . “
121152	121157	121147	121147	you	403	” said the Captain , “
121162	121269	121158	121158	I	0	” Saying which , the Captain took his seat on Mr Perch ’s bracket , and drawing out his handkerchief from the crown of the glazed hat which he jammed between his knees ( without injury to its shape , for nothing human could bend it ) , rubbed his head well all over , and appeared refreshed . He subsequently arranged his hair with his hook , and sat looking round the office , contemplating the clerks with a serene respect . The Captain ’s equanimity was so impenetrable , and he was altogether so mysterious a being , that Perch the messenger was daunted . “
121277	121293	121274	121274	you	0	” asked Mr Perch , bending down over him as he sat on the bracket . “
121296	121303	121274	121274	you	0	” in a deep hoarse whisper . “
121306	121317	121318	121318	Cuttle	394	” said Mr Perch , keeping time with his head . “
121320	121321	121318	121318	Cuttle	394	” “
121324	121356	121318	121318	Cuttle	394	” said Mr Perch , in the same tone , for he caught it , and could n’t help it ; the Captain , in his diplomacy , was so impressive . “
121379	121380	121372	121372	he	394	” “
121398	121422	121388	121388	I	0	” said the Captain , nodding with all the weighty importance that he felt within him . Perch , soon returning , said , “
121430	121473	121424	121425	Captain Cuttle	392	” Mr Carker the Manager , standing on the hearth - rug before the empty fireplace , which was ornamented with a castellated sheet of brown paper , looked at the Captain as he came in , with no very special encouragement . “
121477	121482	121474	121475	Mr Carker	274	” said Captain Cuttle . “
121487	121510	121483	121483	I	0	” said Mr Carker , showing all his teeth . The Captain liked his answering with a smile ; it looked pleasant . “
121514	121542	121511	121511	You	274	” began the Captain , rolling his eyes slowly round the little room , and taking in as much of it as his shirt - collar permitted ; “
121554	121570	121550	121551	Mr Carker	274	Wal”r , as is on your books here , is almost a son of mine . ”
121571	121575	121577	121578	Mr Carker	274	“ Walter Gay ? ”
121586	121587	121582	121582	his	274	“ Wal”r
121592	121597	121550	121551	Mr Carker	274	” replied the Captain , “
121600	121617	121550	121551	Mr Carker	274	” The Captain ’s manner expressed a warm approval of Mr Carker ’s quickness of perception . “
121632	121637	121644	121644	Governor	404	” said the Captain , “
121650	121651	121644	121644	Governor	404	” “
121654	121667	121644	121644	Governor	404	” said Mr Carker , with a still wider demonstration than before . “
121670	121675	121676	121676	I	0	” resumed the Captain , “
121699	121714	121715	121716	The Captain	10100	Wal”r , when — in short , when there was a little accommodation wanted . ”
121734	121741	121718	121718	his	10100	“ You remember , I daresay ? ”
121742	121746	121748	121749	Mr Carker	274	“ I think , ”
121751	121761	121748	121749	Mr Carker	274	“ I had the honour of arranging the business . ”
121762	121767	121769	121770	the Captain	10100	“ To be sure ! ”
121772	121789	121769	121770	the Captain	10100	“ Right again ! you had . Now I ’ve took the liberty of coming here — “
121796	121803	121792	121792	you	10100	” said Mr Carker , smiling . “
121806	121817	121818	121819	A man	868	” returned the Captain , availing himself of the offer . “
121846	121847	121844	121844	yourself	10100	” “
121852	121891	121850	121850	you	10100	” said the Manager , standing , perhaps from the force of winter habit , with his back against the chimney - piece , and looking down upon the Captain with an eye in every tooth and gum . “
121909	121910	121898	121898	you	10100	” “
121917	121922	121898	121898	you	10100	” returned the Captain : “
121932	121974	121978	121982	a lad as ever stepped	3203	Wal”r . Sol Gills , his Uncle , is a man of science , and in science he may be considered a clipper ; but he ai n’t what I should altogether call a able seaman — not man of practice . Wal”r
122013	122031	122005	122005	I	0	” said the Captain , lowering his voice , and speaking in a kind of confidential growl , “
122050	122079	122092	122092	you	0	“ till your head Governor has wore round a bit , and I can come alongside of him , is this.—Is everything right and comfortable here , and is Wal”r
122088	122089	122092	122092	you	0	” “
122099	122114	122096	122097	Captain Cuttle	392	” returned Carker , gathering up his skirts and settling himself in his position . “
122126	122158	122123	122123	you	0	” The acuteness and the significance of the Captain ’s eye as he cocked it in reply , no words short of those unutterable Chinese words before referred to could describe . “
122161	122169	122172	122172	you	0	” said the Captain , unspeakably encouraged , “
122181	122228	122176	122176	I	0	” So much had the Captain expressed in his eye , emboldened and incited by Mr Carker ’s smiling urbanity , that he felt himself in as fair a condition to put the question , as if he had expressed his sentiments with the utmost elaboration . “
122231	122236	122176	122176	I	0	” said Mr Carker , “
122242	122243	122176	122176	I	0	” “
122255	122265	122252	122252	I	0	” cried Captain Cuttle . Mr Carker smiled assent . “
122275	122286	122252	122252	I	0	” pursued the Captain . Mr Carker smiled assent again . “
122291	122301	122302	122302	I	0	” said Captain Cuttle , greatly relieved and pleased . “
122313	122320	122311	122311	I	0	Wal”r so . Thank’ee , thank’ee . ”
122321	122327	122333	122333	his	274	“ Gay has brilliant prospects , ”
122338	122345	122333	122333	his	274	“ all the world before him . ”
122346	122360	122362	122364	the delighted Captain	3206	“ All the world and his wife too , as the saying is , ”
122369	122371	122374	122374	he	274	“ wife ”
122417	122427	122429	122430	the Captain	10100	“ I ’d bet a gill of old Jamaica , ”
122436	122447	122429	122430	the Captain	10100	“ that I know what you ’re a smiling at . ”
122459	122465	122467	122468	the Captain	10100	“ It goes no farther ? ”
122488	122493	122495	122496	Mr Carker	274	“ Not an inch , ”
122498	122508	122510	122511	the Captain	10100	“ You ’re thinking of a capital F perhaps ? ”
122520	122526	122528	122529	the Captain	10100	“ Anything about a L , ”
122531	122536	122528	122529	the Captain	10100	“ or a O ? ”
122542	122549	122551	122552	the Captain	10100	“ Am I right , again ? ”
122625	122631	122633	122634	the Captain	10100	“ He know’d her first , ”
122647	122705	122633	122634	the Captain	10100	“ in an uncommon manner — you remember his finding her in the street when she was a’most a babby — he has liked her ever since , and she him , as much as two youngsters can . We ’ve always said , Sol Gills and me , that they was cut out for each other . ”
122747	122756	122758	122760	the happy Captain	3220	“ There ’s a general indraught that way , ”
122762	122782	122758	122760	the happy Captain	3220	“ Wind and water sets in that direction , you see . Look at his being present t’other day ! ”
122783	122790	122792	122793	Mr Carker	274	“ Most favourable to his hopes , ”
122795	122809	122792	122793	Mr Carker	274	“ Look at his being towed along in the wake of that day ! ”
122814	122823	122792	122793	Mr Carker	274	“ Why what can cut him adrift now ? ”
122824	122827	122829	122830	Mr Carker	274	“ Nothing , ”
122832	122838	122840	122841	the Captain	10100	“ You ’re right again , ”
122849	122872	122840	122841	the Captain	10100	“ Nothing it is . So ! steady ! There ’s a son gone : pretty little creetur . Ai n’t there ? ”
122873	122882	122884	122886	the acquiescent Carker	3223	“ Yes , there ’s a son gone , ”
122888	122901	122884	122886	the acquiescent Carker	3223	“ Pass the word , and there ’s another ready for you , ”
122906	122918	122903	122904	the Captain	10100	“ Nevy of a scientific Uncle ! Nevy of Sol Gills ! Wal”r
122920	122929	122930	122931	the Captain	10100	Wal”r , as is already in your business ! And”—said
122946	122964	122938	122938	he	10100	“ who — comes from Sol Gills ’s daily , to your business , and your buzzums . ”
123043	123048	123050	123051	the Captain	10100	“ Am I right ? ”
123053	123057	123059	123060	Mr Carker	274	“ Captain Cuttle , ”
123092	123115	123079	123079	he	10100	“ your views in reference to Walter Gay are thoroughly and accurately right . I understand that we speak together in confidence . “
123118	123123	123079	123079	he	10100	” interposed the Captain . “
123128	123129	123079	123079	he	10100	” “
123135	123148	123079	123079	he	10100	” pursued the Manager . Captain Cuttle frowned and shook his head . “
123164	123169	123183	123183	I	0	” repeated Mr Carker , “
123178	123179	123183	123183	I	0	” “
123187	123197	123183	123183	I	0	” said the Captain , listening with great attention . “
123217	123218	123210	123210	You	274	” “
123227	123232	123210	123210	You	274	” said the Captain , “
123249	123263	123210	123210	You	274	” Mr Carker , with his mouth from ear to ear , repeated , “
123267	123288	123210	123210	You	274	” Not articulating the words , but bowing his head affably , and forming them with his tongue and lips . “
123302	123312	123314	123315	the Captain	10100	Wal”r ’s in a way to make his fortune , ”
123317	123323	123324	123325	Mr Carker	274	“ To make his fortune , ”
123334	123337	123324	123325	Mr Carker	274	“ And as Wal”r
123366	123371	123373	123373	his	274	” said the Captain . “
123378	123387	123373	123373	his	274	” assented Mr Carker , dumbly as before . “
123397	123402	123415	123416	Mr Carker	274	” pursued the Captain , “
123514	123517	123519	123520	the Captain	10100	“ Farewell ! ”
123522	123565	123567	123568	the Captain	10100	“ I ai n’t a man of many words , but I take it very kind of you to be so friendly , and above - board . You ’ll excuse me if I ’ve been at all intruding , will you ? ”
123570	123575	123567	123568	the Captain	10100	“ Not at all , ”
123580	123590	123592	123593	the Captain	10100	“ Thank’ee . My berth ai n’t very roomy , ”
123599	123663	123592	123593	the Captain	10100	“ but it ’s tolerably snug ; and if you was to find yourself near Brig Place , number nine , at any time — will you make a note of it?—and would come upstairs , without minding what was said by the person at the door , I should be proud to see you . With that hospitable invitation , the Captain said “
123667	123763	123592	123593	the Captain	10100	” and walked out and shut the door ; leaving Mr Carker still reclining against the chimney - piece . In whose sly look and watchful manner ; in whose false mouth , stretched but not laughing ; in whose spotless cravat and very whiskers ; even in whose silent passing of his soft hand over his white linen and his smooth face ; there was something desperately cat - like . The unconscious Captain walked out in a state of self - glorification that imparted quite a new cut to the broad blue suit . “
123769	123776	123767	123767	Ned	392	” said the Captain to himself . “
123791	124022	123777	123777	You	392	” In his exultation , and in his familiarity , present and prospective , with the House , the Captain , when he reached the outer office , could not refrain from rallying Mr Perch a little , and asking him whether he thought everybody was still engaged . But not to be bitter on a man who had done his duty , the Captain whispered in his ear , that if he felt disposed for a glass of rum - and - water , and would follow , he would be happy to bestow the same upon him . Before leaving the premises , the Captain , somewhat to the astonishment of the clerks , looked round from a central point of view , and took a general survey of the officers part and parcel of a project in which his young friend was nearly interested . The strong - room excited his especial admiration ; but , that he might not appear too particular , he limited himself to an approving glance , and , with a graceful recognition of the clerks as a body , that was full of politeness and patronage , passed out into the court . Being promptly joined by Mr Perch , he conveyed that gentleman to the tavern , and fulfilled his pledge — hastily , for Perch ’s time was precious . “
124031	124036	124023	124023	I	0	” said the Captain , “
124037	124039	123767	123767	Ned	392	Wal”r ! ”
124040	124043	124045	124046	Mr Perch	366	“ Who ? ”
124048	124049	124045	124046	Mr Perch	366	“ Wal”r
124051	125056	124045	124046	Mr Perch	366	” repeated the Captain , in a voice of thunder . Mr Perch , who seemed to remember having heard in infancy that there was once a poet of that name , made no objection ; but he was much astonished at the Captain ’s coming into the City to propose a poet ; indeed , if he had proposed to put a poet ’s statue up — say Shakespeare ’s for example — in a civic thoroughfare , he could hardly have done a greater outrage to Mr Perch ’s experience . On the whole , he was such a mysterious and incomprehensible character , that Mr Perch decided not to mention him to Mrs Perch at all , in case of giving rise to any disagreeable consequences . Mysterious and incomprehensible , the Captain , with that lively sense upon him of having done a little business for the youngsters , remained all day , even to his most intimate friends ; and but that Walter attributed his winks and grins , and other such pantomimic reliefs of himself , to his satisfaction in the success of their innocent deception upon old Sol Gills , he would assuredly have betrayed himself before night . As it was , however , he kept his own secret ; and went home late from the Instrument - maker ’s house , wearing the glazed hat so much on one side , and carrying such a beaming expression in his eyes , that Mrs MacStinger ( who might have been brought up at Doctor Blimber ’s , she was such a Roman matron ) fortified herself , at the first glimpse of him , behind the open street door , and refused to come out to the contemplation of her blessed infants , until he was securely lodged in his own room . CHAPTER XVIII . Father and Daughter There is a hush through Mr Dombey ’s house . Servants gliding up and down stairs rustle , but make no sound of footsteps . They talk together constantly , and sit long at meals , making much of their meat and drink , and enjoying themselves after a grim unholy fashion . Mrs Wickam , with her eyes suffused with tears , relates melancholy anecdotes ; and tells them how she always said at Mrs Pipchin ’s that it would be so , and takes more table - ale than usual , and is very sorry but sociable . Cook ’s state of mind is similar . She promises a little fry for supper , and struggles about equally against her feelings and the onions . Towlinson begins to think there ’s a fate in it , and wants to know if anybody can tell him of any good that ever came of living in a corner house . It seems to all of them as having happened a long time ago ; though yet the child lies , calm and beautiful , upon his little bed . After dark there come some visitors — noiseless visitors , with shoes of felt — who have been there before ; and with them comes that bed of rest which is so strange a one for infant sleepers . All this time , the bereaved father has not been seen even by his attendant ; for he sits in an inner corner of his own dark room when anyone is there , and never seems to move at other times , except to pace it to and fro . But in the morning it is whispered among the household that he was heard to go upstairs in the dead night , and that he stayed there — in the room — until the sun was shining . At the offices in the City , the ground - glass windows are made more dim by shutters ; and while the lighted lamps upon the desks are half extinguished by the day that wanders in , the day is half extinguished by the lamps , and an unusual gloom prevails . There is not much business done . The clerks are indisposed to work ; and they make assignations to eat chops in the afternoon , and go up the river . Perch , the messenger , stays long upon his errands ; and finds himself in bars of public - houses , invited thither by friends , and holding forth on the uncertainty of human affairs . He goes home to Ball ’s Pond earlier in the evening than usual , and treats Mrs Perch to a veal cutlet and Scotch ale . Mr Carker the Manager treats no one ; neither is he treated ; but alone in his own room he shows his teeth all day ; and it would seem that there is something gone from Mr Carker ’s path — some obstacle removed — which clears his way before him . Now the rosy children living opposite to Mr Dombey ’s house , peep from their nursery windows down into the street ; for there are four black horses at his door , with feathers on their heads ; and feathers tremble on the carriage that they draw ; and these , and an array of men with scarves and staves , attract a crowd . The juggler who was going to twirl the basin , puts his loose coat on again over his fine dress ; and his trudging wife , one - sided with her heavy baby in her arms , loiters to see the company come out . But closer to her dingy breast she presses her baby , when the burden that is so easily carried is borne forth ; and the youngest of the rosy children at the high window opposite , needs no restraining hand to check her in her glee , when , pointing with her dimpled finger , she looks into her nurse ’s face , and asks “
125061	125099	123767	123767	Ned	392	” And now , among the knot of servants dressed in mourning , and the weeping women , Mr Dombey passes through the hall to the other carriage that is waiting to receive him . He is not “
125103	125417	123767	123767	Ned	392	” these observers think , by sorrow and distress of mind . His walk is as erect , his bearing is as stiff as ever it has been . He hides his face behind no handkerchief , and looks before him . But that his face is something sunk and rigid , and is pale , it bears the same expression as of old . He takes his place within the carriage , and three other gentlemen follow . Then the grand funeral moves slowly down the street . The feathers are yet nodding in the distance , when the juggler has the basin spinning on a cane , and has the same crowd to admire it . But the juggler ’s wife is less alert than usual with the money - box , for a child ’s burial has set her thinking that perhaps the baby underneath her shabby shawl may not grow up to be a man , and wear a sky - blue fillet round his head , and salmon - coloured worsted drawers , and tumble in the mud . The feathers wind their gloomy way along the streets , and come within the sound of a church bell . In this same church , the pretty boy received all that will soon be left of him on earth — a name . All of him that is dead , they lay there , near the perishable substance of his mother . It is well . Their ashes lie where Florence in her walks — oh lonely , lonely walks!—may pass them any day . The service over , and the clergyman withdrawn , Mr Dombey looks round , demanding in a low voice , whether the person who has been requested to attend to receive instructions for the tablet , is there ? Someone comes forward , and says “
125420	125479	125480	125480	I	0	” Mr Dombey intimates where he would have it placed ; and shows him , with his hand upon the wall , the shape and size ; and how it is to follow the memorial to the mother . Then , with his pencil , he writes out the inscription , and gives it to him : adding , “
125489	125498	125480	125480	I	0	“ It shall be done immediately , Sir . ”
125499	125514	125515	125516	The man	9864	“ There is really nothing to inscribe but name and age , you see . ”
125545	125553	125529	125530	Mr Dombey	190	“ I beg your pardon , Sir ; ”
125563	125584	125529	125530	Mr Dombey	190	“ but as you wish it done immediately , and it may be put in hand when I get back — ”
125585	125588	125529	125530	Mr Dombey	190	“ Well ? ”
125589	125608	125529	125530	Mr Dombey	190	“ Will you be so good as read it over again ? I think there ’s a mistake . ”
125609	125612	125613	125614	The statuary	3244	“ Where ? ”
125633	125639	125626	125626	his	9864	“ beloved and only child . ”
125640	125654	125529	125530	Mr Dombey	190	“ It should be , ‘ son , ’ I think , Sir ? ”
125655	125667	125668	125669	The father	849	“ You are right . Of course . Make the correction . ”
125819	125825	125826	125826	They	3247	“ it seems like Sunday . ”
125914	125920	125907	125908	Mr Towlinson	272	“ Amendment to us all ! ”
125931	125940	125925	125925	Cook	408	“ There ’s room enough , God knows . ”
126169	126223	126158	126158	Florence	197	“ Oh my brother , oh my dearly loved and loving brother ! Only friend and companion of my slighted childhood ! Could any less idea shed the light already dawning on your early grave , or give birth to the softened sorrow that is springing into life beneath this rain of tears ! ”
126224	126229	126231	126232	Mrs Chick	208	“ My dear child , ”
126249	126259	126231	126232	Mrs Chick	208	“ when you are as old as I am — ”
126260	126269	126271	126272	Miss Tox	208	“ Which will be the prime of life , ”
126274	126279	126281	126282	Mrs Chick	208	“ You will then , ”
126297	126317	126281	126282	Mrs Chick	208	“ you will then know that all grief is unavailing , and that it is our duty to submit . ”
126318	126329	126331	126331	Florence	197	“ I will try , dear aunt I do try , ”
126335	126343	126345	126346	Mrs Chick	208	“ I am glad to hear it , ”
126348	126376	126345	126346	Mrs Chick	208	“ because ; my love , as our dear Miss Tox — of whose sound sense and excellent judgment , there can not possibly be two opinions — ”
126377	126390	126392	126393	Miss Tox	208	“ My dear Louisa , I shall really be proud , soon , ”
126395	126407	126392	126393	Miss Tox	208	“ — will tell you , and confirm by her experience , ”
126412	126436	126409	126410	Mrs Chick	208	“ we are called upon on all occasions to make an effort It is required of us . If any — my dear , ”
126442	126451	126409	126410	Mrs Chick	208	“ I want a word . Mis — Mis- ”
126452	126455	126457	126458	Miss Tox	208	“ Demeanour ? ”
126460	126467	126469	126470	Mrs Chic	409	“ No , no , no , ”
126471	126490	126409	126410	Mrs Chick	208	“ How can you ! Goodness me , it ’s on , the end of my tongue . Mis- ”
126491	126495	126497	126498	Miss Tox	208	“ Placed affection ? ”
126502	126508	126510	126511	Mrs Chick	208	“ Good gracious , Lucretia ! ”
126512	126565	126409	126410	Mrs Chick	208	“ How very monstrous ! Misanthrope , is the word I want . The idea ! Misplaced affection ! I say , if any misanthrope were to put , in my presence , the question ‘ Why were we born ? ’ I should reply , ‘ To make an effort ’ . ”
126566	126571	126573	126574	Miss Tox	208	“ Very good indeed , ”
126584	126588	126409	126410	Mrs Chick	208	“ Very good . ”
126589	126592	126409	126410	Mrs Chick	208	“ Unhappily , ”
126597	126654	126656	126658	the good matron	3272	“ we have a warning under our own eyes . We have but too much reason to suppose , my dear child , that if an effort had been made in time , in this family , a train of the most trying and distressing circumstances might have been avoided . Nothing shall ever persuade me , ”
126665	126693	126656	126658	the good matron	3272	“ but that if that effort had been made by poor dear Fanny , the poor dear darling child would at least have had a stronger constitution . ”
126733	126765	126717	126717	herself	208	“ Therefore , Florence , pray let us see that you have some strength of mind , and do not selfishly aggravate the distress in which your poor Papa is plunged . ”
126766	126770	126772	126772	Florence	197	“ Dear aunt ! ”
126793	126811	126772	126772	Florence	197	“ Tell me more about Papa . Pray tell me about him ! Is he quite heartbroken ? ”
127088	127262	127264	127265	Mrs Chick	208	“ Florence , my dear child , your poor Papa is peculiar at times ; and to question me about him , is to question me upon a subject which I really do not pretend to understand . I believe I have as much influence with your Papa as anybody has . Still , all I can say is , that he has said very little to me ; and that I have only seen him once or twice for a minute at a time , and indeed have hardly seen him then , for his room has been dark . I have said to your Papa , ‘ Paul!’—that is the exact expression I used—‘Paul ! why do you not take something stimulating ? ’ Your Papa ’s reply has always been , ‘ Louisa , have the goodness to leave me . I want nothing . I am better by myself . ’ If I was to be put upon my oath to - morrow , Lucretia , before a magistrate , ”
127267	127282	127264	127265	Mrs Chick	208	“ I have no doubt I could venture to swear to those identical words . ”
127291	127298	127286	127286	her	208	“ My Louisa is ever methodical ! ”
127299	127305	127307	127308	her aunt	9933	“ In short , Florence , ”
127310	127360	127307	127308	her aunt	9933	“ literally nothing has passed between your poor Papa and myself , until today ; when I mentioned to your Papa that Sir Barnet and Lady Skettles had written exceedingly kind notes — our sweet boy ! Lady Skettles loved him like a — where ’s my pocket handkerchief ? ”
127366	127431	127432	127432	Florence	197	“ Exceedingly kind notes , proposing that you should visit them for change of scene . Mentioning to your Papa that I thought Miss Tox and myself might now go home ( in which he quite agreed ) , I inquired if he had any objection to your accepting this invitation . He said , ‘ No , Louisa , not the least ! ’ ”
127438	127467	127432	127432	Florence	197	“ At the same time , if you would prefer staying here , Florence , to paying this visit at present , or to going home with me — ”
127468	127477	127307	127308	her aunt	9933	“ I should much prefer it , aunt , ”
127483	127489	127491	127492	Mrs Chick	208	“ Why then , child , ”
127494	127552	127491	127492	Mrs Chick	208	“ you can . It ’s a strange choice , I must say . But you always were strange . Anybody else at your time of life , and after what has passed — my dear Miss Tox , I have lost my pocket handkerchief again — would be glad to leave here , one would suppose . ”
127553	127561	127563	127563	Florence	197	“ I should not like to feel , ”
127565	127613	127563	127563	Florence	197	“ as if the house was avoided . I should not like to think that the — his — the rooms upstairs were quite empty and dreary , aunt . I would rather stay here , for the present . Oh my brother ! oh my brother ! ”
127684	127689	127691	127692	Mrs Chick	208	“ Well , child ! ”
127697	127752	127753	127753	Florence	197	“ I would n’t on any account say anything unkind to you , and that I ’m sure you know . You will remain here , then , and do exactly as you like . No one will interfere with you , Florence , or wish to interfere with you , I ’m sure . ”
127761	127787	127789	127790	Mrs Chick	208	“ I had no sooner begun to advise your poor Papa that he really ought to seek some distraction and restoration in a temporary change , ”
127792	127906	127908	127909	Mrs Chick	208	“ than he told me he had already formed the intention of going into the country for a short time . I ’m sure I hope he ’ll go very soon . He ca n’t go too soon . But I suppose there are some arrangements connected with his private papers and so forth , consequent on the affliction that has tried us all so much — I ca n’t think what ’s become of mine : Lucretia , lend me yours , my dear — that may occupy him for one or two evenings in his own room . Your Papa ’s a Dombey , child , if ever there was one , ”
127928	127942	128058	128059	Mrs Chick	208	“ He ’ll make an effort . There ’s no fear of him . ”
127943	127950	127952	127952	Florence	197	“ Is there nothing , aunt , ”
127956	127962	127952	127952	Florence	197	“ I might do to — ”
127963	127970	127972	127973	Mrs Chick	208	“ Lord , my dear child , ”
127977	128038	127972	127973	Mrs Chick	208	“ what are you talking about ? If your Papa said to Me — I have given you his exact words , ‘ Louisa , I want nothing ; I am better by myself’—what do you think he ’d say to you ? You must n’t show yourself to him , child . Do n’t dream of such a thing . ”
128039	128042	128044	128044	Florence	197	“ Aunt , ”
128046	128057	128044	128044	Florence	197	“ I will go and lie down on my bed . ”
129445	129452	129441	129442	the child	716	“ Good - night , Papa , ”
129877	129886	129888	129888	Florence	197	“ A visitor ! To me , Susan ! ”
129895	129911	129913	129913	Susan	241	“ Well , it is a wonder , ai n’t it now , Miss Floy ? ”

130008	130015	130017	130017	Florence	197	“ But the visitor , Susan , ”
130046	130050	130019	130019	Susan	241	“ Mr Toots ! ”
130091	130100	130102	130102	Susan	241	“ My own feelings exactly , Miss Floy , ”
130116	130140	130102	130102	Susan	241	“ Immediately I see that Innocent in the Hall , Miss Floy , I burst out laughing first , and then I choked . ”
130190	130198	130200	130201	Mr Toots	504	“ How d’ye do , Miss Dombey ? ”
130203	130217	130200	130201	Mr Toots	504	“ I ’m very well , I thank you ; how are you ? ”
130319	130327	130329	130330	Mr Toots	504	“ How d’ye do , Miss Dombey ? ”
130332	130346	130329	130330	Mr Toots	504	“ I ’m very well , I thank you ; how are you ? ”
130360	130367	130369	130370	Mr Toots	504	“ I ’m very well indeed , ”
130376	130389	130391	130392	Mr Toots	504	“ Very well indeed , I am . I do n’t remember , ”
130399	130409	130391	130392	Mr Toots	504	“ that I was ever better , thank you . ”
130410	130420	130422	130422	Florence	197	“ It ’s very kind of you to come , ”
130429	130438	130422	130422	Florence	197	“ I am very glad to see you . ”
130488	130498	130500	130500	Florence	197	“ You were very kind to my dear brother , ”
130514	130523	130503	130503	her	197	“ He often talked to me about you . ”
130524	130532	130534	130535	Mr Toots	504	“ Oh it ’s of no consequence , ”
130538	130545	130534	130535	Mr Toots	504	“ Warm , ai n’t it ? ”
130546	130552	130554	130554	Florence	197	“ It is beautiful weather , ”
130556	130562	130564	130565	Mr Toots	504	“ It agrees with me ! ”
130567	130608	130564	130565	Mr Toots	504	“ I do n’t think I ever was so well as I find myself at present , I ’m obliged to you . After stating this curious and unexpected fact , Mr Toots fell into a deep well of silence . “
130619	130629	130616	130616	I	0	” said Florence , trying to help him out . “
130635	130674	130616	130616	I	0	” returned Mr Toots . And tumbled in again . He remained at the bottom , apparently drowned , for at least ten minutes . At the expiration of that period , he suddenly floated , and said , “
130683	130684	130680	130681	Miss Dombey	287	” “
130689	130695	130686	130686	you	504	” asked Florence , rising . “
130710	130722	130727	130727	I	0	” said Mr Toots , sitting down again , most unexpectedly . “
130733	130734	130727	130727	I	0	” “
130744	130753	130727	130727	I	0	” said Florence , with a quiet smile , “
130767	130768	130770	130770	you	0	” “
130774	130790	130770	130770	you	0	” retorted Mr Toots , with sympathy in every fibre of his otherwise expressionless face . “
130829	130837	130838	130839	Poor Dombey	287	” Mr Toots was dressed in mourning . “
130847	130851	130841	130841	I	0	” blubbered Toots . “
130854	130858	130841	130841	I	0	” said Florence . “
130894	130895	130890	130890	his	769	” “
130901	130905	130906	130907	Poor Dombey	287	” cried Florence . “
130913	130953	130954	130954	I	0	” said Mr Toots . Mr Toots , seeing Florence in tears , had great difficulty in getting beyond this point , and had nearly tumbled into the well again . But a chuckle saved him on the brink . “
130957	130961	130954	130954	I	0	” he proceeded , “
131033	131038	131022	131022	He	769	” said Mr Toots , “
131049	131695	131047	131047	you	287	” In fact , Diogenes was at that moment , as they presently ascertained from looking down into the street , staring through the window of a hackney cabriolet , into which , for conveyance to that spot , he had been ensnared , on a false pretence of rats among the straw . Sooth to say , he was as unlike a lady ’s dog as might be ; and in his gruff anxiety to get out , presented an appearance sufficiently unpromising , as he gave short yelps out of one side of his mouth , and overbalancing himself by the intensity of every one of those efforts , tumbled down into the straw , and then sprung panting up again , putting out his tongue , as if he had come express to a Dispensary to be examined for his health . But though Diogenes was as ridiculous a dog as one would meet with on a summer ’s day ; a blundering , ill - favoured , clumsy , bullet - headed dog , continually acting on a wrong idea that there was an enemy in the neighbourhood , whom it was meritorious to bark at ; and though he was far from good - tempered , and certainly was not clever , and had hair all over his eyes , and a comic nose , and an inconsistent tail , and a gruff voice ; he was dearer to Florence , in virtue of that parting remembrance of him , and that request that he might be taken care of , than the most valuable and beautiful of his kind . So dear , indeed , was this same ugly Diogenes , and so welcome to her , that she took the jewelled hand of Mr Toots and kissed it in her gratitude . And when Diogenes , released , came tearing up the stairs and bouncing into the room ( such a business as there was , first , to get him out of the cabriolet ! ) , dived under all the furniture , and wound a long iron chain , that dangled from his neck , round legs of chairs and tables , and then tugged at it until his eyes became unnaturally visible , in consequence of their nearly starting out of his head ; and when he growled at Mr Toots , who affected familiarity ; and went pell - mell at Towlinson , morally convinced that he was the enemy whom he had barked at round the corner all his life and had never seen yet ; Florence was as pleased with him as if he had been a miracle of discretion . Mr Toots was so overjoyed by the success of his present , and was so delighted to see Florence bending down over Diogenes , smoothing his coarse back with her little delicate hand — Diogenes graciously allowing it from the first moment of their acquaintance — that he felt it difficult to take leave , and would , no doubt , have been a much longer time in making up his mind to do so , if he had not been assisted by Diogenes himself , who suddenly took it into his head to bay Mr Toots , and to make short runs at him with his mouth open . Not exactly seeing his way to the end of these demonstrations , and sensible that they placed the pantaloons constructed by the art of Burgess and Co. in jeopardy , Mr Toots , with chuckles , lapsed out at the door : by which , after looking in again two or three times , without any object at all , and being on each occasion greeted with a fresh run from Diogenes , he finally took himself off and got away . “
131720	132082	132084	132084	Pa	415	” said Florence , fondling his shaggy head . And Di , the rough and gruff , as if his hairy hide were pervious to the tear that dropped upon it , and his dog ’s heart melted as it fell , put his nose up to her face , and swore fidelity . [ Illustration ] Diogenes the man did not speak plainer to Alexander the Great than Diogenes the dog spoke to Florence . He subscribed to the offer of his little mistress cheerfully , and devoted himself to her service . A banquet was immediately provided for him in a corner ; and when he had eaten and drunk his fill , he went to the window where Florence was sitting , looking on , rose up on his hind legs , with his awkward fore paws on her shoulders , licked her face and hands , nestled his great head against her heart , and wagged his tail till he was tired . Finally , Diogenes coiled himself up at her feet and went to sleep . Although Miss Nipper was nervous in regard of dogs , and felt it necessary to come into the room with her skirts carefully collected about her , as if she were crossing a brook on stepping - stones ; also to utter little screams and stand up on chairs when Diogenes stretched himself , she was in her own manner affected by the kindness of Mr Toots , and could not see Florence so alive to the attachment and society of this rude friend of little Paul ’s , without some mental comments thereupon that brought the water to her eyes . Mr Dombey , as a part of her reflections , may have been , in the association of ideas , connected with the dog ; but , at any rate , after observing Diogenes and his mistress all the evening , and after exerting herself with much good - will to provide Diogenes a bed in an ante - chamber outside his mistress ’s door , she said hurriedly to Florence , before leaving her for the night : “
132096	132097	132084	132084	Pa	415	” “
132105	132106	132103	132103	Susan	241	” “
132118	132119	132121	132121	you	241	” “
132124	132133	132121	132121	you	241	” asked Florence , without looking at her , “
132141	132142	132139	132139	Susan	241	” “
132183	132184	132187	132187	Susan	241	” “
132189	132194	132187	132187	Susan	241	” urged Florence gently . “
132200	132221	132197	132198	Miss Floy	197	” returned Miss Nipper , who was full of burning indignation , and minded her stops even less than usual . “
132253	132291	132251	132251	none	3373	” It appeared from what she added and had gleaned downstairs , that Mrs Chick had proposed the Major for Mr Dombey ’s companion , and that Mr Dombey , after some hesitation , had invited him . “
132301	132311	132251	132251	none	3373	” observed Miss Nipper to herself with boundless contempt . “
132323	132324	132251	132251	none	3373	” “
132331	132335	132329	132329	Susan	241	” said Florence . “
132346	133064	133065	133065	Papa	242	” Her tone of commiseration smote the chord so often roughly touched , but never listened to while she or anyone looked on . Florence left alone , laid her head upon her hand , and pressing the other over her swelling heart , held free communication with her sorrows . It was a wet night ; and the melancholy rain fell pattering and dropping with a weary sound . A sluggish wind was blowing , and went moaning round the house , as if it were in pain or grief . A shrill noise quivered through the trees . While she sat weeping , it grew late , and dreary midnight tolled out from the steeples . Florence was little more than a child in years — not yet fourteen — and the loneliness and gloom of such an hour in the great house where Death had lately made its own tremendous devastation , might have set an older fancy brooding on vague terrors . But her innocent imagination was too full of one theme to admit them . Nothing wandered in her thoughts but love — a wandering love , indeed , and castaway — but turning always to her father . There was nothing in the dropping of the rain , the moaning of the wind , the shuddering of the trees , the striking of the solemn clocks , that shook this one thought , or diminished its interest . Her recollections of the dear dead boy — and they were never absent — were itself , the same thing . And oh , to be shut out : to be so lost : never to have looked into her father ’s face or touched him , since that hour ! She could not go to bed , poor child , and never had gone yet , since then , without making her nightly pilgrimage to his door . It would have been a strange sad sight , to see her now , stealing lightly down the stairs through the thick gloom , and stopping at it with a beating heart , and blinded eyes , and hair that fell down loosely and unthought of ; and touching it outside with her wet cheek . But the night covered it , and no one knew . The moment that she touched the door on this night , Florence found that it was open . For the first time it stood open , though by but a hair’s - breadth : and there was a light within . The first impulse of the timid child — and she yielded to it — was to retire swiftly . Her next , to go back , and to enter ; and this second impulse held her in irresolution on the staircase . In its standing open , even by so much as that chink , there seemed to be hope . There was encouragement in seeing a ray of light from within , stealing through the dark stern doorway , and falling in a thread upon the marble floor . She turned back , hardly knowing what she did , but urged on by the love within her , and the trial they had undergone together , but not shared : and with her hands a little raised and trembling , glided in . Her father sat at his old table in the middle room . He had been arranging some papers , and destroying others , and the latter lay in fragile ruins before him . The rain dripped heavily upon the glass panes in the outer room , where he had so often watched poor Paul , a baby ; and the low complainings of the wind were heard without . But not by him . He sat with his eyes fixed on the table , so immersed in thought , that a far heavier tread than the light foot of his child could make , might have failed to rouse him . His face was turned towards her . By the waning lamp , and at that haggard hour , it looked worn and dejected ; and in the utter loneliness surrounding him , there was an appeal to Florence that struck home . “
133076	133104	133074	133074	Papa	242	” He started at her voice , and leaped up from his seat . She was close before him with extended arms , but he fell back . “
133110	133116	133074	133074	Papa	242	” he said , sternly . “
133128	133385	133386	133386	I	0	” If anything had frightened her , it was the face he turned upon her . The glowing love within the breast of his young daughter froze before it , and she stood and looked at him as if stricken into stone . There was not one touch of tenderness or pity in it . There was not one gleam of interest , parental recognition , or relenting in it . There was a change in it , but not of that kind . The old indifference and cold constraint had given place to something : what , she never thought and did not dare to think , and yet she felt it in its force , and knew it well without a name : that as it looked upon her , seemed to cast a shadow on her head . Did he see before him the successful rival of his son , in health and life ? Did he look upon his own successful rival in that son ’s affection ? Did a mad jealousy and withered pride , poison sweet remembrances that should have endeared and made her precious to him ? Could it be possible that it was gall to him to look upon her in her beauty and her promise : thinking of his infant boy ! Florence had no such thoughts . But love is quick to know when it is spurned and hopeless : and hope died out of hers , as she stood looking in her father ’s face . “
133407	133408	133409	133409	I	0	” “
133414	133415	133412	133412	Papa	242	” “
133422	133526	133527	133527	You	3376	” She saw he knew why : it was written broadly on his face : and dropped her head upon her hands with one prolonged low cry . Let him remember it in that room , years to come . It has faded from the air , before he breaks the silence . It may pass as quickly from his brain , as he believes , but it is there . Let him remember it in that room , years to come ! He took her by the arm . His hand was cold , and loose , and scarcely closed upon her . “
133534	133550	133527	133527	You	3376	” he said , taking up the light , and leading her towards the door , “
133569	133595	133564	133564	You	3376	” The dream she had had , was over then , God help her ! and she felt that it could never more come back . “
133615	133622	133611	133611	yours	3376	” said her father , slowly . “
133633	133644	133611	133611	yours	3376	” Still covering her face , she sobbed , and answered “
133652	133844	133650	133650	Papa	242	” and silently ascended . Once she looked back as if she would have returned to him , but for fear . It was a momentary thought , too hopeless to encourage ; and her father stood there with the light — hard , unresponsive , motionless — until the fluttering dress of his fair child was lost in the darkness . Let him remember it in that room , years to come . The rain that falls upon the roof : the wind that mourns outside the door : may have foreknowledge in their melancholy sound . Let him remember it in that room , years to come ! The last time he had watched her , from the same place , winding up those stairs , she had had her brother in her arms . It did not move his heart towards her now , it steeled it : but he went into his room , and locked his door , and sat down in his chair , and cried for his lost boy . Diogenes was broad awake upon his post , and waiting for his little mistress . “
133860	134376	133851	133852	dear Di	3380	” Diogenes already loved her for her own , and did n’t care how much he showed it . So he made himself vastly ridiculous by performing a variety of uncouth bounces in the ante - chamber , and concluded , when poor Florence was at last asleep , and dreaming of the rosy children opposite , by scratching open her bedroom door : rolling up his bed into a pillow : lying down on the boards , at the full length of his tether , with his head towards her : and looking lazily at her , upside down , out of the tops of his eyes , until from winking and winking he fell asleep himself , and dreamed , with gruff barks , of his enemy . CHAPTER XIX . Walter goes away The wooden Midshipman at the Instrument - maker ’s door , like the hard - hearted little Midshipman he was , remained supremely indifferent to Walter ’s going away , even when the very last day of his sojourn in the back parlour was on the decline . With his quadrant at his round black knob of an eye , and his figure in its old attitude of indomitable alacrity , the Midshipman displayed his elfin small - clothes to the best advantage , and , absorbed in scientific pursuits , had no sympathy with worldly concerns . He was so far the creature of circumstances , that a dry day covered him with dust , and a misty day peppered him with little bits of soot , and a wet day brightened up his tarnished uniform for the moment , and a very hot day blistered him ; but otherwise he was a callous , obdurate , conceited Midshipman , intent on his own discoveries , and caring as little for what went on about him , terrestrially , as Archimedes at the taking of Syracuse . Such a Midshipman he seemed to be , at least , in the then position of domestic affairs . Walter eyed him kindly many a time in passing in and out ; and poor old Sol , when Walter was not there , would come and lean against the doorpost , resting his weary wig as near the shoe - buckles of the guardian genius of his trade and shop as he could . But no fierce idol with a mouth from ear to ear , and a murderous visage made of parrot ’s feathers , was ever more indifferent to the appeals of its savage votaries , than was the Midshipman to these marks of attachment . Walter ’s heart felt heavy as he looked round his old bedroom , up among the parapets and chimney - pots , and thought that one more night already darkening would close his acquaintance with it , perhaps for ever . Dismantled of his little stock of books and pictures , it looked coldly and reproachfully on him for his desertion , and had already a foreshadowing upon it of its coming strangeness . “
134382	134386	133851	133852	dear Di	3380	” thought Walter , “
134463	134533	134534	134534	Uncle	10023	” But his Uncle was not to be left alone in the little back parlour , where he was then sitting by himself ; for Captain Cuttle , considerate in his roughness , stayed away against his will , purposely that they should have some talk together unobserved : so Walter , newly returned home from his last day ’s bustle , descended briskly , to bear him company . “
134536	134551	134534	134534	Uncle	10023	” he said gaily , laying his hand upon the old man ’s shoulder , “
134561	134562	134554	134554	I	0	” “
134593	134594	134590	134590	you	10023	” “
134662	134673	134654	134654	Uncle	10023	” Old Sol wiped his spectacles , and faintly smiled . “
134680	134698	134699	134699	You	3393	” cried Walter , merrily , and clapping him half a dozen times more upon the shoulder . “
134744	134745	134746	134746	Wally	293	” “
134752	134758	134746	134746	Wally	293	” returned the old man , “
134771	134772	134768	134768	my	0	” “
134779	134788	134774	134774	your	3393	” said Walter , with his pleasant laugh , “
134810	134811	134808	134808	Uncle	3399	” “
134818	134824	134814	134814	Wally	293	” replied the old man ; “
134857	134858	134855	134855	Wally	293	” “
134869	134879	134867	134867	Uncle	3401	” said Walter , after a moment ’s hesitation , “
134887	134888	134880	134880	I	0	” “
134895	134911	134880	134880	I	0	” murmured the old man , raising his eyebrows , and his spectacles with them . “
134917	134921	134880	134880	I	0	” said Walter , “
134978	134979	134972	134972	I	0	” “
134987	134999	134972	134972	I	0	” replied his Uncle , rousing himself from a temporary abstraction . “
135005	135009	135010	135010	Susan	241	” pursued Walter , “
135094	135095	135090	135090	you	10023	” “
135103	135114	135090	135090	you	10023	” replied his Uncle , in the tone as before . “
135119	135123	135116	135116	I	0	” pursued Walter , “
135197	135201	135195	135195	Uncle	3408	” said Walter , “
135262	135279	135283	135283	you	10023	” His honest voice and manner corroborated what he said , and quite established its ingenuousness . “
135290	135294	135283	135283	you	10023	” said Walter , “
135408	135412	135414	135414	her	287	” said Walter : “
135451	135662	135430	135430	she’ll	287	” They were at that very moment going out at the door in one of Walter ’s trunks . A porter carrying off his baggage on a truck for shipment at the docks on board the Son and Heir , had got possession of them ; and wheeled them away under the very eye of the insensible Midshipman before their owner had well finished speaking . But that ancient mariner might have been excused his insensibility to the treasure as it rolled away . For , under his eye at the same moment , accurately within his range of observation , coming full into the sphere of his startled and intensely wide - awake look - out , were Florence and Susan Nipper : Florence looking up into his face half timidly , and receiving the whole shock of his wooden ogling ! More than this , they passed into the shop , and passed in at the parlour door before they were observed by anybody but the Midshipman . And Walter , having his back to the door , would have known nothing of their apparition even then , but for seeing his Uncle spring out of his own chair , and nearly tumble over another . [ Illustration ] “
135667	135671	135665	135665	Uncle	3416	” exclaimed Walter . “
135677	135682	135683	135684	Miss Dombey	287	” Old Solomon replied , “

135692	135705	135683	135684	Miss Dombey	287	” cried Walter , looking round and starting up in his turn . “
135708	135782	135683	135684	Miss Dombey	287	” Why , It was so possible and so actual , that , while the words were on his lips , Florence hurried past him ; took Uncle Sol ’s snuff - coloured lapels , one in each hand ; kissed him on the cheek ; and turning , gave her hand to Walter with a simple truth and earnestness that was her own , and no one else ’s in the world ! “
135788	135792	135786	135786	Walter	293	” said Florence . “
135798	135810	135795	135796	Miss Dombey	287	” he replied , but not so hopefully as he endeavoured : “
135818	135819	135811	135811	I	0	” “
135824	135833	135834	135834	He	11039	” said Florence , looking back at Solomon . “
135861	135862	135855	135855	I	0	” “
135866	135871	135855	135855	I	0	” exclaimed Miss Nipper , “
135922	135995	135913	135913	Blimbers	365	” With that Miss Nipper untied her bonnet strings , and after looking vacantly for some moments into a little black teapot that was set forth with the usual homely service on the table , shook her head and a tin canister , and began unasked to make the tea . In the meantime Florence had turned again to the Instrument - maker , who was as full of admiration as surprise . “
135999	136004	135913	135913	Blimbers	365	” said old Sol . “
136017	136018	136076	136076	You	3422	” “
136021	136025	136026	136026	Ye	3422	” said Florence . “
136030	136061	136026	136026	Ye	3422	” returned old Sol , rubbing his hands slowly , and considering the matter half aloud , as something pensive in the bright eyes looking at him arrested his attention . “
136074	136075	136026	136026	Ye	3422	” “
136080	136087	136076	136076	You	3422	” said Florence with a smile , “
136097	136098	136099	136099	My	0	” “
136104	136111	136099	136099	My	0	” returned the Instrument - maker , “
136159	136160	136162	136162	he	293	” “
136164	136168	136162	136162	he	293	” said Florence . “
136194	136388	136389	136389	I	0	” and again she gave him her little hand so freely and so faithfully that Walter held it for some moments in his own , and could not bear to let it go . Yet Walter did not hold it as he might have held it once , nor did its touch awaken those old day - dreams of his boyhood that had floated past him sometimes even lately , and confused him with their indistinct and broken shapes . The purity and innocence of her endearing manner , and its perfect trustfulness , and the undisguised regard for him that lay so deeply seated in her constant eyes , and glowed upon her fair face through the smile that shaded — for alas ! it was a smile too sad to brighten — it , were not of their romantic race . They brought back to his thoughts the early death - bed he had seen her tending , and the love the child had borne her ; and on the wings of such remembrances she seemed to rise up , far above his idle fancies , into clearer and serener air . “
136404	136412	136402	136402	Sir	735	” said Florence to the old man , “
136419	136420	136414	136414	you	3425	” “
136426	136431	136414	136414	you	3425	” cried old Sol . “
136438	136439	136435	136436	Good gracious	3429	” “
136453	136464	136451	136451	you	3425	” said Florence , glancing round , and sighing gently . “
136480	136510	136476	136476	I	0	” Old Sol looked first at her , then at his nephew , and then rubbed his hands , and rubbed his spectacles , and said below his breath , “
136519	136553	136476	136476	I	0	” There was a short silence ; during which Susan Nipper skilfully impounded two extra cups and saucers from the cupboard , and awaited the drawing of the tea with a thoughtful air . “
136562	136587	136554	136554	I	0	” said Florence , laying her hand timidly upon the old man ’s as it rested on the table , to bespeak his attention , “
136662	136722	136723	136723	You	0	” The Instrument - maker , without speaking , put her hand to his lips , and Susan Nipper , leaning back with her arms crossed , in the chair of presidency into which she had voted herself , bit one end of her bonnet strings , and heaved a gentle sigh as she looked up at the skylight . “
136732	136736	136726	136726	me	0	” said Florence , “
136803	136876	136797	136797	you	0	” The sweet face looking into his , the gentle pleading eyes , the soft voice , and the light touch on his arm made the more winning by a child ’s respect and honour for his age , that gave to all an air of graceful doubt and modest hesitation — these , and her natural earnestness , so overcame the poor old Instrument - maker , that he only answered : “
136893	136894	136888	136888	I	0	” “
136899	136907	136897	136897	Walter	293	” returned Florence with her quiet smile . “
136936	136956	136934	136934	Walter	293	” The regretful tone in which she said these latter words , touched Walter more than all the rest . “
136960	136981	136957	136958	Miss Florence	197	” he replied , with an effort to recover the cheerful manner he had preserved while talking with his Uncle , “
137030	137056	137028	137028	you	197	” Susan Nipper began upon a new part of her bonnet string , and nodded at the skylight , in approval of the sentiment expressed . “
137063	137067	137061	137061	Walter	293	” said Florence , “
137101	137102	137104	137105	a stranger	9917	” “
137107	137111	137104	137105	a stranger	9917	” returned Walter , “
137134	137135	137132	137132	one	9971	” “
137155	137163	137164	137164	he	3445	” added Florence , bursting into tears , “
137260	137846	137847	137847	Walter	293	” And in its fulness and its sweet simplicity , she held out both her hands to him . Walter taking them , stooped down and touched the tearful face that neither shrunk nor turned away , nor reddened as he did so , but looked up at him with confidence and truth . In that one moment , every shadow of doubt or agitation passed away from Walter ’s soul . It seemed to him that he responded to her innocent appeal , beside the dead child ’s bed : and , in the solemn presence he had seen there , pledged himself to cherish and protect her very image , in his banishment , with brotherly regard ; to garner up her simple faith , inviolate ; and hold himself degraded if he breathed upon it any thought that was not in her own breast when she gave it to him . Susan Nipper , who had bitten both her bonnet strings at once , and imparted a great deal of private emotion to the skylight , during this transaction , now changed the subject by inquiring who took milk and who took sugar ; and being enlightened on these points , poured out the tea . They all four gathered socially about the little table , and took tea under that young lady ’s active superintendence ; and the presence of Florence in the back parlour , brightened the Tartar frigate on the wall . Half an hour ago Walter , for his life , would have hardly called her by her name . But he could do so now when she entreated him . He could think of her being there , without a lurking misgiving that it would have been better if she had not come . He could calmly think how beautiful she was , how full of promise , what a home some happy man would find in such a heart one day . He could reflect upon his own place in that heart , with pride ; and with a brave determination , if not to deserve it — he still thought that far above him — never to deserve it less . Some fairy influence must surely have hovered round the hands of Susan Nipper when she made the tea , engendering the tranquil air that reigned in the back parlour during its discussion . Some counter - influence must surely have hovered round the hands of Uncle Sol ’s chronometer , and moved them faster than the Tartar frigate ever went before the wind . Be this as it may , the visitors had a coach in waiting at a quiet corner not far off ; and the chronometer , on being incidentally referred to , gave such a positive opinion that it had been waiting a long time , that it was impossible to doubt the fact , especially when stated on such unimpeachable authority . If Uncle Sol had been going to be hanged by his own time , he never would have allowed that the chronometer was too fast , by the least fraction of a second . Florence at parting recapitulated to the old man all that she had said before , and bound him to their compact . Uncle Sol attended her lovingly to the legs of the wooden Midshipman , and there resigned her to Walter , who was ready to escort her and Susan Nipper to the coach . “
137849	137856	137847	137847	Walter	293	” said Florence by the way , “
137877	137878	137868	137868	you	293	” “
137881	137885	137868	137868	you	293	” said Walter , “
137909	137910	137901	137901	I	0	” “
137918	137935	137916	137916	Walter	293	” inquired Florence , after a moment ’s hesitation , and looking anxiously in his face . “
137939	137943	137916	137916	Walter	293	” returned Walter . “
137946	137981	137916	137916	Walter	293	” Walter would have given anything to have answered in the affirmative , but his face answered before his lips could , and Florence was too attentive to it not to understand its reply . “
137994	138000	137985	137985	you	293	” she said , timidly . “
138006	138012	137985	137985	you	293	” replied Walter , smiling , “
138018	138019	138023	138023	Walter	293	” “
138025	138026	138023	138023	Walter	293	” “
138032	138041	138023	138023	Walter	293	” said Walter , understanding what she meant . “
138090	138223	138224	138224	You	3454	” Had Florence any misgiving of which she was hardly conscious : any misgiving that had sprung into an indistinct and undefined existence since that recent night when she had gone down to her father ’s room : that Walter ’s accidental interest in her , and early knowledge of her , might have involved him in that powerful displeasure and dislike ? Had Walter any such idea , or any sudden thought that it was in her mind at that moment ? Neither of them hinted at it . Neither of them spoke at all , for some short time . Susan , walking on the other side of Walter , eyed them both sharply ; and certainly Miss Nipper ’s thoughts travelled in that direction , and very confidently too . “
138231	138235	138238	138238	Walter	293	” said Florence , “
138240	138241	138238	138238	Walter	293	” “
138247	138251	138252	138254	an old man	10637	” said Walter , “
138270	138271	138272	138272	Papa	242	” “
138274	138282	138272	138272	Papa	242	” said Florence , after a moment , “
138332	138397	138398	138398	Walter	293	” There was a touching modulation in these words about her father , that Walter understood too well . The coach being close at hand , he would have left her without speaking , for now he felt what parting was ; but Florence held his hand when she was seated , and then he found there was a little packet in her own . “
138400	138413	138398	138398	Walter	293	” she said , looking full upon him with her affectionate eyes , “
138483	138655	138476	138476	You	293	” He was glad that Susan Nipper came between them , or he might have left her with a sorrowful remembrance of him . He was glad too that she did not look out of the coach again , but waved the little hand to him instead , as long as he could see it . In spite of her request , he could not help opening the packet that night when he went to bed . It was a little purse : and there was money in it . Bright rose the sun next morning , from his absence in strange countries and up rose Walter with it to receive the Captain , who was already at the door : having turned out earlier than was necessary , in order to get under weigh while Mrs MacStinger was still slumbering . The Captain pretended to be in tip - top spirits , and brought a very smoky tongue in one of the pockets of the broad blue coat for breakfast . “
138658	138660	138662	138663	the Captain	10100	Wal”r , ”
138698	138699	138683	138683	he	11039	” “
138706	138712	138704	138704	Ned	392	” returned the old man . “
138725	138726	138720	138720	Walter	293	” “
138730	138735	138737	138737	him	11039	” cried the Captain . “
138739	138740	138737	138737	him	11039	” “
138745	138750	138737	138737	him	11039	” said Sol Gills , “
138783	138784	138786	138786	him	11039	” “
138788	138793	138786	138786	him	11039	” cried the Captain . “
138797	138832	138834	138835	the Captain	10100	Wal”r , my lad . Train up a fig - tree in the way it should go , and when you are old sit under the shade on it . Overhaul the — Well , ”
138840	138869	138834	138835	the Captain	10100	“ I ai n’t quite certain where that ’s to be found , but when found , make a note of . Sol Gills , heave ahead again ! ”
138870	138890	138892	138894	the old man	1205	“ But there or somewhere , it shall lie , Ned , until Wally comes back to claim it , ”
138896	138905	138892	138894	the old man	1205	“ That ’s all I meant to say . ”
138906	138912	138914	138915	the Captain	10100	“ And well said too , ”
138917	138938	138914	138915	the Captain	10100	“ and if we three do n’t crack that bottle in company , I ’ll give you two leave to . ”
139145	139149	139151	139151	Walter	293	“ Mr Carker ! ”
139162	139223	139157	139158	John Carker	274	“ Pray come in ! This is kind of you , to be here so early to say good - bye to me . You knew how glad it would make me to shake hands with you , once , before going away . I can not say how glad I am to have this opportunity . Pray come in . ”
139224	139238	139240	139241	the other	10537	“ It is not likely that we may ever meet again , Walter , ”
139248	139295	139240	139241	the other	10537	“ and I am glad of this opportunity too . I may venture to speak to you , and to take you by the hand , on the eve of separation . I shall not have to resist your frank approaches , Walter , any more . ”
139324	139330	139332	139332	Walter	293	“ Ah , Mr Carker ! ”
139334	139355	139332	139332	Walter	293	“ Why did you resist them ? You could have done me nothing but good , I am very sure . ”
139361	139368	139369	139369	he	293	“ If there were any good , ”
139372	139429	139369	139369	he	293	“ I could do on this earth , I would do it , Walter , for you . The sight of you from day to day , has been at once happiness and remorse to me . But the pleasure has outweighed the pain . I know that , now , by knowing what I lose . ”
139430	139446	139448	139448	Walter	293	“ Come in , Mr Carker , and make acquaintance with my good old Uncle , ”
139450	139478	139480	139480	Walter	293	“ I have often talked to him about you , and he will be glad to tell you all he hears from me . I have not , ”
139492	139528	139480	139480	Walter	293	“ I have not told him anything about our last conversation , Mr Carker ; not even him , believe me . The grey Junior pressed his hand , and tears rose in his eyes . “
139539	139543	139480	139480	Walter	293	” he returned , “
139613	139614	139615	139615	I	0	” “
139618	139622	139623	139623	you	293	” said Walter , “
139660	139661	139638	139639	Mr Carker	274	” “
139666	139671	139638	139639	Mr Carker	274	” replied the other , “
139712	139713	139706	139706	Walter	293	” “
139728	139734	139726	139726	Sir	735	” cried Walter with emotion . “
139737	139749	139726	139726	Sir	735	” said the other , retaining his hand while he spoke ; “
139837	140165	140170	140171	the Captain	10100	” His figure crept like a shadow down the bright , sun - lighted street , so cheerful yet so solemn in the early summer morning ; and slowly passed away . The relentless chronometer at last announced that Walter must turn his back upon the wooden Midshipman : and away they went , himself , his Uncle , and the Captain , in a hackney - coach to a wharf , where they were to take steam - boat for some Reach down the river , the name of which , as the Captain gave it out , was a hopeless mystery to the ears of landsmen . Arrived at this Reach ( whither the ship had repaired by last night ’s tide ) , they were boarded by various excited watermen , and among others by a dirty Cyclops of the Captain ’s acquaintance , who , with his one eye , had made the Captain out some mile and a half off , and had been exchanging unintelligible roars with him ever since . Becoming the lawful prize of this personage , who was frightfully hoarse and constitutionally in want of shaving , they were all three put aboard the Son and Heir . And the Son and Heir was in a pretty state of confusion , with sails lying all bedraggled on the wet decks , loose ropes tripping people up , men in red shirts running barefoot to and fro , casks blockading every foot of space , and , in the thickest of the fray , a black cook in a black caboose up to his eyes in vegetables and blinded with smoke . The Captain immediately drew Walter into a corner , and with a great effort , that made his face very red , pulled up the silver watch , which was so big , and so tight in his pocket , that it came out like a bung . “
140166	140168	140170	140171	the Captain	10100	Wal”r , ”
140185	140221	140170	140171	the Captain	10100	“ a parting gift , my lad . Put it back half an hour every morning , and about another quarter towards the arternoon , and it ’s a watch that ’ll do you credit . ”
140222	140233	140235	140235	Walter	293	“ Captain Cuttle ! I could n’t think of it ! ”
140246	140257	140235	140235	Walter	293	“ Pray take it back . I have one already . ”
140258	140261	140170	140171	the Captain	10100	“ Then , Wal”r
140263	140299	140235	140235	Walter	293	” said the Captain , suddenly diving into one of his pockets and bringing up the two teaspoons and the sugar - tongs , with which he had armed himself to meet such an objection , “
140309	140310	140235	140235	Walter	293	” “
140320	140324	140235	140235	Walter	293	” cried Walter , “
140338	140349	140335	140336	Captain Cuttle	392	” for the Captain was about to jerk them overboard . “
140400	140768	140770	140771	Major Bagstock	298	” They were over the side in the confusion , before Walter caught another glimpse of either ; and when he ran up to the stern , and looked after them , he saw his Uncle hanging down his head in the boat , and Captain Cuttle rapping him on the back with the great silver watch ( it must have been very painful ) , and gesticulating hopefully with the teaspoons and sugar - tongs . Catching sight of Walter , Captain Cuttle dropped the property into the bottom of the boat with perfect unconcern , being evidently oblivious of its existence , and pulling off the glazed hat hailed him lustily . The glazed hat made quite a show in the sun with its glistening , and the Captain continued to wave it until he could be seen no longer . Then the confusion on board , which had been rapidly increasing , reached its height ; two or three other boats went away with a cheer ; the sails shone bright and full above , as Walter watched them spread their surface to the favourable breeze ; the water flew in sparkles from the prow ; and off upon her voyage went the Son and Heir , as hopefully and trippingly as many another son and heir , gone down , had started on his way before her . Day after day , old Sol and Captain Cuttle kept her reckoning in the little back parlour and worked out her course , with the chart spread before them on the round table . At night , when old Sol climbed upstairs , so lonely , to the attic where it sometimes blew great guns , he looked up at the stars and listened to the wind , and kept a longer watch than would have fallen to his lot on board the ship . The last bottle of the old Madeira , which had had its cruising days , and known its dangers of the deep , lay silently beneath its dust and cobwebs , in the meanwhile , undisturbed . CHAPTER XX . Mr Dombey goes upon a Journey Mr Dombey , Sir , ”
140773	140775	140770	140771	Major Bagstock	298	“ Joey ”
140810	140818	140805	140805	Damme	326	” cried the Major with sudden ferocity , “
140831	140915	140805	140805	Damme	326	” Major Bagstock delivered himself of these expressions on receiving Mr Dombey as his guest at the head of his own staircase in Princess ’s Place . Mr Dombey had come to breakfast with the Major , previous to their setting forth on their trip ; and the ill - starved Native had already undergone a world of misery arising out of the muffins , while , in connexion with the general question of boiled eggs , life was a burden to him . “
140928	140939	140805	140805	Damme	326	” observed the Major , relapsing into a mild state , “
140958	140969	140956	140956	Sir	735	” cried the Major , in another spasm of ferocity , “
140975	141093	141094	141094	Dombey	190	” The Major ’s purple visage deepened in its hue , and the Major ’s lobster eyes stood out in bolder relief , as he shook Mr Dombey by the hand , imparting to that peaceful action as defiant a character as if it had been the prelude to his immediately boxing Mr Dombey for a thousand pounds a side and the championship of England . With a rotatory motion of his head , and a wheeze very like the cough of a horse , the Major then conducted his visitor to the sitting - room , and there welcomed him ( having now composed his feelings ) with the freedom and frankness of a travelling companion . “
141096	141101	141094	141094	Dombey	190	” said the Major , “
141154	141155	141156	141156	Major	10950	” “
141158	141163	141156	141156	Major	10950	” returned Mr Dombey , “
141169	141170	141164	141164	you	10950	” “
141175	141180	141164	141164	you	10950	” said the Major , “
141259	141265	141257	141257	Sir	735	” said the Major resolutely , “
141273	141759	141257	141257	Sir	735	” Mr Dombey , in his estimation of himself and his money , felt that this was very true , and therefore did not dispute the point . But the instinctive recognition of such a truth by the Major , and his plain avowal of it , were very able . It was a confirmation to Mr Dombey , if he had required any , of his not being mistaken in the Major . It was an assurance to him that his power extended beyond his own immediate sphere ; and that the Major , as an officer and a gentleman , had a no less becoming sense of it , than the beadle of the Royal Exchange . And if it were ever consolatory to know this , or the like of this , it was consolatory then , when the impotence of his will , the instability of his hopes , the feebleness of wealth , had been so direfully impressed upon him . What could it do , his boy had asked him . Sometimes , thinking of the baby question , he could hardly forbear inquiring , himself , what could it do indeed : what had it done ? But these were lonely thoughts , bred late at night in the sullen despondency and gloom of his retirement , and pride easily found its reassurance in many testimonies to the truth , as unimpeachable and precious as the Major ’s . Mr Dombey , in his friendlessness , inclined to the Major . It can not be said that he warmed towards him , but he thawed a little , The Major had had some part — and not too much — in the days by the seaside . He was a man of the world , and knew some great people . He talked much , and told stories ; and Mr Dombey was disposed to regard him as a choice spirit who shone in society , and who had not that poisonous ingredient of poverty with which choice spirits in general are too much adulterated . His station was undeniable . Altogether the Major was a creditable companion , well accustomed to a life of leisure , and to such places as that they were about to visit , and having an air of gentlemanly ease about him that mixed well enough with his own City character , and did not compete with it at all . If Mr Dombey had any lingering idea that the Major , as a man accustomed , in the way of his calling , to make light of the ruthless hand that had lately crushed his hopes , might unconsciously impart some useful philosophy to him , and scare away his weak regrets , he hid it from himself , and left it lying at the bottom of his pride , unexamined . “
141765	141805	141806	141807	You villain	3510	” said the Major , looking wrathfully round the room . The Native , who had no particular name , but answered to any vituperative epithet , presented himself instantly at the door and ventured to come no nearer . “
141809	141815	141806	141807	You villain	3510	” said the choleric Major , “
141821	141869	141870	141870	Dombey	190	” The dark servant disappeared in search of it , and was quickly heard reascending the stairs in such a tremulous state , that the plates and dishes on the tray he carried , trembling sympathetically as he came , rattled again , all the way up . “
141872	141903	141870	141870	Dombey	190	” said the Major , glancing at the Native as he arranged the table , and encouraging him with an awful shake of his fist when he upset a spoon , “
141940	141941	141927	141928	Old Joe	290	” “
141948	142001	141946	141946	Major	298	” replied his guest ; and not in mere politeness either ; for the Major always took the best possible care of himself , and indeed ate rather more of rich meats than was good for him , insomuch that his Imperial complexion was mainly referred by the faculty to that circumstance . “
142012	142017	142002	142002	You	298	” observed the Major . “
142024	142025	142019	142019	you	298	” “
142031	142036	142026	142026	You	298	” retorted Mr Dombey . “
142039	142040	142041	142042	Charming woman	3514	” “
142046	142066	142044	142044	Sir	735	” said the Major , with a fat laugh rising in his short throat , and nearly suffocating him . “
142080	142123	142070	142075	a very good sort of person	3516	” replied Mr Dombey . The haughty coldness of the reply seemed to afford Major Bagstock infinite delight . He swelled and swelled , exceedingly : and even laid down his knife and fork for a moment , to rub his hands . “
142129	142134	142124	142125	Old Joe	290	” said the Major , “
142164	142165	142162	142162	Sir	735	” “
142171	142176	142162	142162	Sir	735	” Mr Dombey replied , “
142195	142196	142189	142189	you	735	” “
142204	142235	142198	142198	you	735	” was the Major ’s rejoinder . There never was a more unlikely possibility . It was so clearly expressed in Mr Dombey ’s face , that the Major apologised . “
142241	142245	142238	142238	your	735	” he said . “
142260	142273	142258	142258	Dombey	190	” The Major paused in his eating , and looked mysteriously indignant . “
142285	142289	142276	142281	a de - vilish ambitious woman	3521	” Mr Dombey said “
142292	142317	142318	142319	That woman	3523	” with frigid indifference : mingled perhaps with some contemptuous incredulity as to Miss Tox having the presumption to harbour such a superior quality . “
142323	142328	142321	142321	Sir	735	” said the Major , “
142379	142427	142369	142369	Joey	301	” The Major accompanied this with such a look , and , between eating , drinking , hot tea , devilled grill , muffins , and meaning , was altogether so swollen and inflamed about the head , that even Mr Dombey showed some anxiety for him . “
142435	142440	142433	142433	Sir	735	” pursued the Major , “
142455	142456	142453	142453	Dombey	190	” “
142463	142468	142457	142457	I	0	” said Mr Dombey . “
142476	142485	142474	142474	Dombey	190	” returned the Major in a warning voice . “
142493	142515	142491	142491	Major	298	” said Mr Dombey . The Major gave no answer but the horse ’s cough , and went on eating vigorously . “
142525	142534	142516	142516	She	3529	” said the Major , stopping short again , “
142549	142550	142516	142516	She	3529	” “
142553	142561	142516	142516	She	3529	” replied Mr Dombey with great stateliness , “
142637	142657	142634	142634	I	0	” said Mr Dombey , in the tone of a man who was making a great and valuable concession , “
142738	142751	142733	142734	Miss Tox	208	” added Mr Dombey , with a slight wave of his hand , “
142759	142760	142733	142734	Miss Tox	208	” “
142763	142770	142761	142761	Dombey	186	” said the Major , warmly : “
142830	142860	142828	142828	Dombey	186	” said the Major , with a struggle which it was not very difficult to parade , his whole life being a struggle against all kinds of apoplectic symptoms , “
142869	142940	142828	142828	Dombey	186	” Mr Dombey seemed touched , as it is not improbable the Major designed he should be , by this allusion . He looked down and sighed : and the Major , rousing himself fiercely , again said , in reference to the state of mind into which he felt himself in danger of falling , that this was weakness , and nothing should induce him to submit to it . “
142951	142956	142941	142942	Our friend	3513	” said the Major , “
142981	143016	142979	142979	Ma’am	219	” he added , raising his eyes from his plate , and casting them across Princess ’s Place , to where Miss Tox was at that moment visible at her window watering her flowers , “
143044	143070	143042	143042	Ma’am	219	” said the Major , rolling his head at the unconscious Miss Tox , while his starting eyes appeared to make a leap towards her , “
143097	143118	143087	143087	I	0	” Here the Major laughed frightfully up in the tips of his ears and in the veins of his head . “
143124	143129	143122	143122	Ma’am	219	” said the Major , “
143160	143161	143162	143162	Major	298	” “
143164	143171	143162	143162	Major	298	” said Mr Dombey , reddening , “
143190	143191	143174	143174	you	298	” “
143194	143199	143200	143200	I	0	” returned the Major , “
143252	143273	143242	143247	a devilish artful and ambitious woman	3560	” Mr Dombey involuntarily glanced over the way ; and an angry glance he sent in that direction , too . “
143290	143296	143287	143288	Joseph Bagstock	419	” said the Major firmly . “
143323	143336	143315	143315	he	419	” cried the Major , again apostrophising his fair neighbour , with great ire,—“when
143349	143379	143321	143321	Ma’am	219	” The emotion of this outbreak threw the Major into a paroxysm of horse ’s coughs , which held him for a long time . On recovering he added : “
143440	143454	143433	143433	I	0	” said the Major , wagging his double chin with a jocose air , “
143517	143584	143585	143586	J. B.	324	” Mr Dombey , in a few words , expressed his sense of the preference he received over those other distinguished members of society who were clamouring for the possession of Major Bagstock . But the Major cut him short by giving him to understand that he followed his own inclinations , and that they had risen up in a body and said with one accord , “
143600	144212	143588	143588	Dombey	186	” The Major being by this time in a state of repletion , with essence of savoury pie oozing out at the corners of his eyes , and devilled grill and kidneys tightening his cravat : and the time moreover approaching for the departure of the railway train to Birmingham , by which they were to leave town : the Native got him into his great - coat with immense difficulty , and buttoned him up until his face looked staring and gasping , over the top of that garment , as if he were in a barrel . The Native then handed him separately , and with a decent interval between each supply , his washleather gloves , his thick stick , and his hat ; which latter article the Major wore with a rakish air on one side of his head , by way of toning down his remarkable visage . The Native had previously packed , in all possible and impossible parts of Mr Dombey ’s chariot , which was in waiting , an unusual quantity of carpet - bags and small portmanteaus , no less apoplectic in appearance than the Major himself : and having filled his own pockets with Seltzer water , East India sherry , sandwiches , shawls , telescopes , maps , and newspapers , any or all of which light baggage the Major might require at any instant of the journey , he announced that everything was ready . To complete the equipment of this unfortunate foreigner ( currently believed to be a prince in his own country ) , when he took his seat in the rumble by the side of Mr Towlinson , a pile of the Major ’s cloaks and great - coats was hurled upon him by the landlord , who aimed at him from the pavement with those great missiles like a Titan , and so covered him up , that he proceeded , in a living tomb , to the railroad station . But before the carriage moved away , and while the Native was in the act of sepulture , Miss Tox appearing at her window , waved a lilywhite handkerchief . Mr Dombey received this parting salutation very coldly — very coldly even for him — and honouring her with the slightest possible inclination of his head , leaned back in the carriage with a very discontented look . His marked behaviour seemed to afford the Major ( who was all politeness in his recognition of Miss Tox ) unbounded satisfaction ; and he sat for a long time afterwards , leering , and choking , like an over - fed Mephistopheles . During the bustle of preparation at the railway , Mr Dombey and the Major walked up and down the platform side by side ; the former taciturn and gloomy , and the latter entertaining him , or entertaining himself , with a variety of anecdotes and reminiscences , in most of which Joe Bagstock was the principal performer . Neither of the two observed that in the course of these walks , they attracted the attention of a working man who was standing near the engine , and who touched his hat every time they passed ; for Mr Dombey habitually looked over the vulgar herd , not at them ; and the Major was looking , at the time , into the core of one of his stories . At length , however , this man stepped before them as they turned round , and pulling his hat off , and keeping it off , ducked his head to Mr Dombey . “
144219	144224	144214	144214	your	3568	” said the man , “
144237	144313	144226	144226	I	0	” He was dressed in a canvas suit abundantly besmeared with coal - dust and oil , and had cinders in his whiskers , and a smell of half - slaked ashes all over him . He was not a bad - looking fellow , nor even what could be fairly called a dirty - looking fellow , in spite of this ; and , in short , he was Mr Toodle , professionally clothed . “
144328	144333	144314	144314	I	0	” said Mr Toodle . “
144347	144375	144314	144314	I	0	” Mr Dombey looked at him , in return for his tone of interest , as if a man like that would make his very eyesight dirty . “
144383	144394	144381	144381	Sir	735	” said Toodle , seeing he was not clearly remembered , “
144408	144449	144403	144403	Richards	227	” A change in Mr Dombey ’s face , which seemed to express recollection of him , and so it did , but it expressed in a much stronger degree an angry sense of humiliation , stopped Mr Toodle short . “
144458	144481	144455	144455	I	0	” said Mr Dombey , putting his hand in his pocket , and speaking ( but that he always did ) haughtily . “
144487	144491	144485	144485	Sir	735	” returned Toodle , “
144503	144524	144499	144499	I	0	” Mr Dombey was stopped short now in his turn : and awkwardly : with his hand in his pocket . “
144529	144541	144527	144527	Sir	735	” said Toodle , turning his oilskin cap round and round ; “
144580	144629	144576	144576	we	3579	” Mr Dombey would have rubbed on to his own carriage , though in so doing he had rubbed the stoker underneath the wheels ; but his attention was arrested by something in connexion with the cap still going slowly round and round in the man ’s hand . “
144635	144639	144632	144633	one babby	3583	” observed Toodle , “
144646	144647	144632	144633	one babby	3583	” “
144650	144660	144632	144633	one babby	3583	” added Mr Dombey , looking at the cap . “
144688	144713	144714	144714	them	3586	” said Toodle , ducking again , as if to remind Mr Dombey of what had passed between them on that subject long ago , “
144745	144746	144730	144730	They	3586	” “
144751	144756	144749	144749	Major	10950	” said Mr Dombey . “
144763	144783	144761	144761	Sir	735	” resumed Toodle , taking a step before them and deferentially stopping them again , still cap in hand : “
144826	144827	144814	144814	you	735	” “
144832	144841	144830	144830	man	919	” said Mr Dombey in his severest manner . “
144846	144847	144844	144844	him	229	” “
144852	144868	144850	144850	Sir	735	” returned Toodle , shaking his head with a face of great anxiety and distress , “
144883	144884	144891	144891	he	229	” “
144893	144905	144891	144891	he	229	” said Mr Dombey , with a hard kind of satisfaction . “
144918	144944	144906	144906	He	229	” pursued the father , looking wistfully at both , and evidently taking the Major into the conversation with the hope of having his sympathy . “
144983	144993	144971	144971	You	735	” said Toodle , again addressing Mr Dombey individually ; “
145019	145035	145010	145010	Polly	218	” said Toodle with the same dejected look , and another appeal to the Major . “
145051	145061	145049	145049	Major	10950	” said Mr Dombey , giving him his arm . “
145066	145067	145049	145049	Major	10950	” “
145085	145090	145083	145083	Sir	735	” returned the Major . “
145103	145176	145083	145083	Sir	735	” The simple father was beginning to submit that he hoped his son , the quondam Grinder , huffed and cuffed , and flogged and badged , and taught , as parrots are , by a brute jobbed into his place of schoolmaster with as much fitness for it as a hound , might not have been educated on quite a right plan in some undiscovered respect , when Mr Dombey angrily repeating “
145181	145283	145083	145083	Sir	735	” led the Major away . And the Major being heavy to hoist into Mr Dombey ’s carriage , elevated in mid - air , and having to stop and swear that he would flay the Native alive , and break every bone in his skin , and visit other physical torments upon him , every time he could n’t get his foot on the step , and fell back on that dark exile , had barely time before they started to repeat hoarsely that it would never do : that it always failed : and that if he were to educate “
145288	147253	147254	147254	Dombey	190	” he would certainly be hanged . Mr Dombey assented bitterly ; but there was something more in his bitterness , and in his moody way of falling back in the carriage , and looking with knitted brows at the changing objects without , than the failure of that noble educational system administered by the Grinders ’ Company . He had seen upon the man ’s rough cap a piece of new crape , and he had assured himself , from his manner and his answers , that he wore it for _ his _ son . So ! from high to low , at home or abroad , from Florence in his great house to the coarse churl who was feeding the fire then smoking before them , everyone set up some claim or other to a share in his dead boy , and was a bidder against him ! Could he ever forget how that woman had wept over his pillow , and called him her own child ! or how he , waking from his sleep , had asked for her , and had raised himself in his bed and brightened when she came in ! To think of this presumptuous raker among coals and ashes going on before there , with his sign of mourning ! To think that he dared to enter , even by a common show like that , into the trial and disappointment of a proud gentleman ’s secret heart ! To think that this lost child , who was to have divided with him his riches , and his projects , and his power , and allied with whom he was to have shut out all the world as with a double door of gold , should have let in such a herd to insult him with their knowledge of his defeated hopes , and their boasts of claiming community of feeling with himself , so far removed : if not of having crept into the place wherein he would have lorded it , alone ! He found no pleasure or relief in the journey . Tortured by these thoughts he carried monotony with him , through the rushing landscape , and hurried headlong , not through a rich and varied country , but a wilderness of blighted plans and gnawing jealousies . The very speed at which the train was whirled along , mocked the swift course of the young life that had been borne away so steadily and so inexorably to its foredoomed end . The power that forced itself upon its iron way — its own — defiant of all paths and roads , piercing through the heart of every obstacle , and dragging living creatures of all classes , ages , and degrees behind it , was a type of the triumphant monster , Death . Away , with a shriek , and a roar , and a rattle , from the town , burrowing among the dwellings of men and making the streets hum , flashing out into the meadows for a moment , mining in through the damp earth , booming on in darkness and heavy air , bursting out again into the sunny day so bright and wide ; away , with a shriek , and a roar , and a rattle , through the fields , through the woods , through the corn , through the hay , through the chalk , through the mould , through the clay , through the rock , among objects close at hand and almost in the grasp , ever flying from the traveller , and a deceitful distance ever moving slowly within him : like as in the track of the remorseless monster , Death ! Through the hollow , on the height , by the heath , by the orchard , by the park , by the garden , over the canal , across the river , where the sheep are feeding , where the mill is going , where the barge is floating , where the dead are lying , where the factory is smoking , where the stream is running , where the village clusters , where the great cathedral rises , where the bleak moor lies , and the wild breeze smooths or ruffles it at its inconstant will ; away , with a shriek , and a roar , and a rattle , and no trace to leave behind but dust and vapour : like as in the track of the remorseless monster , Death ! Breasting the wind and light , the shower and sunshine , away , and still away , it rolls and roars , fierce and rapid , smooth and certain , and great works and massive bridges crossing up above , fall like a beam of shadow an inch broad , upon the eye , and then are lost . Away , and still away , onward and onward ever : glimpses of cottage - homes , of houses , mansions , rich estates , of husbandry and handicraft , of people , of old roads and paths that look deserted , small , and insignificant as they are left behind : and so they do , and what else is there but such glimpses , in the track of the indomitable monster , Death ! Away , with a shriek , and a roar , and a rattle , plunging down into the earth again , and working on in such a storm of energy and perseverance , that amidst the darkness and whirlwind the motion seems reversed , and to tend furiously backward , until a ray of light upon the wet wall shows its surface flying past like a fierce stream . Away once more into the day , and through the day , with a shrill yell of exultation , roaring , rattling , tearing on , spurning everything with its dark breath , sometimes pausing for a minute where a crowd of faces are , that in a minute more are not ; sometimes lapping water greedily , and before the spout at which it drinks has ceased to drip upon the ground , shrieking , roaring , rattling through the purple distance ! Louder and louder yet , it shrieks and cries as it comes tearing on resistless to the goal : and now its way , still like the way of Death , is strewn with ashes thickly . Everything around is blackened . There are dark pools of water , muddy lanes , and miserable habitations far below . There are jagged walls and falling houses close at hand , and through the battered roofs and broken windows , wretched rooms are seen , where want and fever hide themselves in many wretched shapes , while smoke and crowded gables , and distorted chimneys , and deformity of brick and mortar penning up deformity of mind and body , choke the murky distance . As Mr Dombey looks out of his carriage window , it is never in his thoughts that the monster who has brought him there has let the light of day in on these things : not made or caused them . It was the journey ’s fitting end , and might have been the end of everything ; it was so ruinous and dreary . So , pursuing the one course of thought , he had the one relentless monster still before him . All things looked black , and cold , and deadly upon him , and he on them . He found a likeness to his misfortune everywhere . There was a remorseless triumph going on about him , and it galled and stung him in his pride and jealousy , whatever form it took : though most of all when it divided with him the love and memory of his lost boy . There was a face — he had looked upon it , on the previous night , and it on him with eyes that read his soul , though they were dim with tears , and hidden soon behind two quivering hands — that often had attended him in fancy , on this ride . He had seen it , with the expression of last night , timidly pleading to him . It was not reproachful , but there was something of doubt , almost of hopeful incredulity in it , which , as he once more saw that fade away into a desolate certainty of his dislike , was like reproach . It was a trouble to him to think of this face of Florence . Because he felt any new compunction towards it ? No . Because the feeling it awakened in him — of which he had had some old foreshadowing in older times — was full - formed now , and spoke out plainly , moving him too much , and threatening to grow too strong for his composure . Because the face was abroad , in the expression of defeat and persecution that seemed to encircle him like the air . Because it barbed the arrow of that cruel and remorseless enemy on which his thoughts so ran , and put into its grasp a double - handed sword . Because he knew full well , in his own breast , as he stood there , tinging the scene of transition before him with the morbid colours of his own mind , and making it a ruin and a picture of decay , instead of hopeful change , and promise of better things , that life had quite as much to do with his complainings as death . One child was gone , and one child left . Why was the object of his hope removed instead of her ? The sweet , calm , gentle presence in his fancy , moved him to no reflection but that . She had been unwelcome to him from the first ; she was an aggravation of his bitterness now . If his son had been his only child , and the same blow had fallen on him , it would have been heavy to bear ; but infinitely lighter than now , when it might have fallen on her ( whom he could have lost , or he believed it , without a pang ) , and had not . Her loving and innocent face rising before him , had no softening or winning influence . He rejected the angel , and took up with the tormenting spirit crouching in his bosom . Her patience , goodness , youth , devotion , love , were as so many atoms in the ashes upon which he set his heel . He saw her image in the blight and blackness all around him , not irradiating but deepening the gloom . More than once upon this journey , and now again as he stood pondering at this journey ’s end , tracing figures in the dust with his stick , the thought came into his mind , what was there he could interpose between himself and it ? The Major , who had been blowing and panting all the way down , like another engine , and whose eye had often wandered from his newspaper to leer at the prospect , as if there were a procession of discomfited Miss Toxes pouring out in the smoke of the train , and flying away over the fields to hide themselves in any place of refuge , aroused his friends by informing him that the post - horses were harnessed and the carriage ready . “
147256	147270	147254	147254	Dombey	190	” said the Major , rapping him on the arm with his cane , “
147332	147549	147550	147550	Bagstock	298	” The Major even in his friendly remonstrances , thus consulting the dignity and honour of Mr Dombey , and showing a lively sense of their importance , Mr Dombey felt more than ever disposed to defer to a gentleman possessing so much good sense and such a well - regulated mind ; accordingly he made an effort to listen to the Major ’s stories , as they trotted along the turnpike road ; and the Major , finding both the pace and the road a great deal better adapted to his conversational powers than the mode of travelling they had just relinquished , came out of his entertainment . But still the Major , blunt and tough as he was , and as he so very often said he was , administered some palatable catering to his companion ’s appetite . He related , or rather suffered it to escape him , accidentally , and as one might say , grudgingly and against his will , how there was great curiosity and excitement at the club , in regard of his friend Dombey . How he was suffocated with questions , Sir . How old Joe Bagstock was a greater man than ever , there , on the strength of Dombey . How they said , “
147578	147588	147590	147590	they	3612	” said the Major , with a broad stare , “
147605	148634	147593	147594	J. B.	324	” In this flow of spirits and conversation , only interrupted by his usual plethoric symptoms , and by intervals of lunch , and from time to time by some violent assault upon the Native , who wore a pair of ear - rings in his dark - brown ears , and on whom his European clothes sat with an outlandish impossibility of adjustment — being , of their own accord , and without any reference to the tailor ’s art , long where they ought to be short , short where they ought to be long , tight where they ought to be loose , and loose where they ought to be tight — and to which he imparted a new grace , whenever the Major attacked him , by shrinking into them like a shrivelled nut , or a cold monkey — in this flow of spirits and conversation , the Major continued all day : so that when evening came on , and found them trotting through the green and leafy road near Leamington , the Major ’s voice , what with talking and eating and chuckling and choking , appeared to be in the box under the rumble , or in some neighbouring hay - stack . Nor did the Major improve it at the Royal Hotel , where rooms and dinner had been ordered , and where he so oppressed his organs of speech by eating and drinking , that when he retired to bed he had no voice at all , except to cough with , and could only make himself intelligible to the dark servant by gasping at him . He not only rose next morning , however , like a giant refreshed , but conducted himself , at breakfast like a giant refreshing . At this meal they arranged their daily habits . The Major was to take the responsibility of ordering everything to eat and drink ; and they were to have a late breakfast together every morning , and a late dinner together every day . Mr Dombey would prefer remaining in his own room , or walking in the country by himself , on that first day of their sojourn at Leamington ; but next morning he would be happy to accompany the Major to the Pump - room , and about the town . So they parted until dinner - time . Mr Dombey retired to nurse his wholesome thoughts in his own way . The Major , attended by the Native carrying a camp - stool , a great - coat , and an umbrella , swaggered up and down through all the public places : looking into subscription books to find out who was there , looking up old ladies by whom he was much admired , reporting J. B. tougher than ever , and puffing his rich friend Dombey wherever he went . There never was a man who stood by a friend more staunchly than the Major , when in puffing him , he puffed himself . It was surprising how much new conversation the Major had to let off at dinner - time , and what occasion he gave Mr Dombey to admire his social qualities . At breakfast next morning , he knew the contents of the latest newspapers received ; and mentioned several subjects in connexion with them , on which his opinion had recently been sought by persons of such power and might , that they were only to be obscurely hinted at . Mr Dombey , who had been so long shut up within himself , and who had rarely , at any time , overstepped the enchanted circle within which the operations of Dombey and Son were conducted , began to think this an improvement on his solitary life ; and in place of excusing himself for another day , as he had thought of doing when alone , walked out with the Major arm - in - arm . CHAPTER XXI . New Faces The MAJOR , more blue - faced and staring — more over - ripe , as it were , than ever — and giving vent , every now and then , to one of the horse ’s coughs , not so much of necessity as in a spontaneous explosion of importance , walked arm - in - arm with Mr Dombey up the sunny side of the way , with his cheeks swelling over his tight stock , his legs majestically wide apart , and his great head wagging from side to side , as if he were remonstrating within himself for being such a captivating object . They had not walked many yards , before the Major encountered somebody he knew , nor many yards farther before the Major encountered somebody else he knew , but he merely shook his fingers at them as he passed , and led Mr Dombey on : pointing out the localities as they went , and enlivening the walk with any current scandal suggested by them . In this manner the Major and Mr Dombey were walking arm - in - arm , much to their own satisfaction , when they beheld advancing towards them , a wheeled chair , in which a lady was seated , indolently steering her carriage by a kind of rudder in front , while it was propelled by some unseen power in the rear . Although the lady was not young , she was very blooming in the face — quite rosy — and her dress and attitude were perfectly juvenile . Walking by the side of the chair , and carrying her gossamer parasol with a proud and weary air , as if so great an effort must be soon abandoned and the parasol dropped , sauntered a much younger lady , very handsome , very haughty , very wilful , who tossed her head and drooped her eyelids , as though , if there were anything in all the world worth looking into , save a mirror , it certainly was not the earth or sky . “
148646	148659	148644	148644	Sir	735	” cried the Major , stopping as this little cavalcade drew near . “
148664	148672	148662	148662	Edith	429	” drawled the lady in the chair , “
148676	148829	148673	148674	Major Bagstock	298	” The Major no sooner heard the voice , than he relinquished Mr Dombey ’s arm , darted forward , took the hand of the lady in the chair and pressed it to his lips . With no less gallantry , the Major folded both his gloves upon his heart , and bowed low to the other lady . And now , the chair having stopped , the motive power became visible in the shape of a flushed page pushing behind , who seemed to have in part outgrown and in part out - pushed his strength , for when he stood upright he was tall , and wan , and thin , and his plight appeared the more forlorn from his having injured the shape of his hat , by butting at the carriage with his head to urge it forward , as is sometimes done by elephants in Oriental countries . “
148833	148841	148830	148831	Joe Bagstock	290	” said the Major to both ladies , “
148855	148856	148857	148857	You	290	” “
148861	148872	148857	148857	You	290	” said the old lady in the chair , insipidly . “
148885	148886	148879	148879	I	0	” “
148898	148905	148893	148894	a friend	10173	” said the Major , promptly , “
148919	148928	148916	148917	Mrs Skewton	430	” The lady in the chair was gracious . “
148935	148957	148932	148933	Mrs Granger	431	” The lady with the parasol was faintly conscious of Mr Dombey ’s taking off his hat , and bowing low . “
148964	148969	148932	148933	Mrs Granger	431	” said the Major , “
148975	149000	149001	149002	Mrs Skewton	430	” [ Illustration ] The Major seemed in earnest , for he looked at all the three , and leered in his ugliest manner . “
149006	149011	149004	149004	Dombey	190	” said the Major , “
149021	149033	149018	149019	old Josh	300	” Mr Dombey signified that he did n’t wonder at it . “
149038	149046	149018	149019	old Josh	300	” said the lady in the chair , “
149060	149061	149053	149053	you	190	” “
149065	149070	149053	149053	you	190	” replied the Major . “
149083	149113	149073	149073	you	190	” returned the lady , slightly settling her false curls and false eyebrows with her fan , and showing her false teeth , set off by her false complexion , “
149124	149125	149073	149073	you	190	” “
149133	149141	149131	149131	Mama	212	” interrupted the younger lady , scornfully . “
149146	149151	149144	149144	Edith	429	” said the other , “
149184	149200	149202	149202	her	3624	” said Mrs Skewton , rustling a handkerchief that was faint and sickly with essences , “
149209	149400	149202	149202	her	3624	” The discrepancy between Mrs Skewton ’s fresh enthusiasm of words , and forlornly faded manner , was hardly less observable than that between her age , which was about seventy , and her dress , which would have been youthful for twenty - seven . Her attitude in the wheeled chair ( which she never varied ) was one in which she had been taken in a barouche , some fifty years before , by a then fashionable artist who had appended to his published sketch the name of Cleopatra : in consequence of a discovery made by the critics of the time , that it bore an exact resemblance to that Princess as she reclined on board her galley . Mrs Skewton was a beauty then , and bucks threw wine - glasses over their heads by dozens in her honour . The beauty and the barouche had both passed away , but she still preserved the attitude , and for this reason expressly , maintained the wheeled chair and the butting page : there being nothing whatever , except the attitude , to prevent her from walking . “
149411	149441	149444	149444	Dombey	190	” said Mrs Skewton , settling her diamond brooch . And by the way , she chiefly lived upon the reputation of some diamonds , and her family connexions . “
149448	149453	149444	149444	Dombey	190	” returned the Major , “
149476	149477	149463	149474	a man who is paramount in the greatest city in the universe	3626	” “
149485	149490	149482	149483	a stranger	9917	” said Mrs Skewton , “
149498	149523	149463	149474	a man who is paramount in the greatest city in the universe	3626	” As Mr Dombey acknowledged the compliment with a bend of his head , the younger lady glancing at him , met his eyes . “
149530	149538	149528	149528	Madam	3633	” said Mr Dombey , addressing her . “
149574	149575	149576	149576	Edith	429	” “
149582	149592	149576	149576	Edith	429	” said Mrs Skewton , with a ghastly archness . “
149606	149616	149617	149617	They	3635	” was the answer , delivered with supreme indifference . “
149630	149640	149627	149628	Mr Dombey	190	” observed Mrs Skewton , with a mincing sigh , “
149677	149678	149673	149673	his	190	” “
149697	149703	149686	149686	you	212	” said the younger lady . “
149708	149713	149686	149686	you	212	” returned Mrs Skewton , “
149780	149828	149830	149830	I	0	” This curious association of objects , suggesting a remembrance of the celebrated bull who got by mistake into a crockery shop , was received with perfect gravity by Mr Dombey , who intimated his opinion that Nature was , no doubt , a very respectable institution . “
149833	149843	149830	149830	I	0	” drawled Mrs Skewton , pinching her shrivelled throat , “
149847	149867	149830	149830	I	0	” It was frightfully true in one sense , if not in that in which she used the phrase . “
149892	149898	149886	149886	We	3640	” We were , indeed . “
149902	149907	149886	149886	We	3640	” said Mrs Skewton , “
149920	149921	149922	149922	Nature	433	” “
149936	149981	149929	149929	Mama	212	” said the younger lady , curling her handsome lip . At this hint , the wan page , who had been surveying the party over the top of the chair , vanished behind it , as if the ground had swallowed him up . “
149988	150032	149986	149986	Withers	3641	” said Mrs Skewton , as the chair began to move ; calling to the page with all the languid dignity with which she had called in days of yore to a coachman with a wig , cauliflower nosegay , and silk stockings . “
150040	150055	149986	149986	Withers	3641	” The Major was staying at the Royal Hotel , with his friend Dombey . “
150069	150074	150056	150056	You	3641	” lisped Mrs Skewton . “
150092	150324	150087	150087	Withers	434	” The Major again pressed to his blue lips the tips of the fingers that were disposed on the ledge of the wheeled chair with careful carelessness , after the Cleopatra model : and Mr Dombey bowed . The elder lady honoured them both with a very gracious smile and a girlish wave of her hand ; the younger lady with the very slightest inclination of her head that common courtesy allowed . The last glimpse of the wrinkled face of the mother , with that patched colour on it which the sun made infinitely more haggard and dismal than any want of colour could have been , and of the proud beauty of the daughter with her graceful figure and erect deportment , engendered such an involuntary disposition on the part of both the Major and Mr Dombey to look after them , that they both turned at the same moment . The Page , nearly as much aslant as his own shadow , was toiling after the chair , uphill , like a slow battering - ram ; the top of Cleopatra ’s bonnet was fluttering in exactly the same corner to the inch as before ; and the Beauty , loitering by herself a little in advance , expressed in all her elegant form , from head to foot , the same supreme disregard of everything and everybody . “
150332	150344	150325	150325	I	0	” said the Major , as they resumed their walk again . “
150377	150382	150383	150383	she	3523	” said the Major , “
150387	150388	150390	150390	you	0	” “
150395	150400	150390	150390	you	0	” inquired Mr Dombey . “
150409	150414	150416	150416	he	301	” said the Major , “
150422	150423	150416	150416	he	301	” “
150431	150436	150437	150439	An ancient flame	3652	” returned Mr Dombey . “
150443	150448	150449	150450	Devilish ancient	3654	” chuckled Major Bagstock . “
150456	150457	150452	150452	I	0	” “
150466	150471	150458	150458	She	3523	” said Mr Dombey . “
150476	150492	150474	150474	Sir	735	” said the Major , stopping short , and staring in his companion ’s face . “
150543	150575	150541	150541	Sir	735	” The Major gave a flourish with his stick and walked on again , in despair of being able to say what you came to , if you came to that . “
150584	150594	150581	150581	I	0	” said Mr Dombey , after a short pause , “
150599	150600	150596	150597	Mrs Granger	431	” “
150606	150630	150601	150602	Edith Skewton	437	” returned the Major , stopping short again , and punching a mark in the ground with his cane , to represent her , “
150640	150649	150650	150650	Granger	431	” whom the Major indicated by another punch . “
150654	150671	150650	150650	Granger	431	” said the Major , tapping the last ideal portrait , and rolling his head emphatically , “
150704	150737	150691	150691	He	3663	” The Major ran the representative of the deceased Granger through and through the body with his walking - stick , and went on again , carrying his stick over his shoulder . “
150744	150753	150754	150755	Edith Granger	429	” asked Mr Dombey , making another halt . “
150759	150793	150754	150755	Edith Granger	429	” replied the Major , shutting one eye , putting his head on one side , passing his cane into his left hand , and smoothing his shirt - frill with his right , “
150810	150826	150808	150808	Sir	735	” said the Major , shouldering his stick once more , and walking on again , “
150833	150834	150827	150827	she	429	” “
150840	150846	150837	150838	any family	3673	” asked Mr Dombey presently . “
150851	150856	150849	150849	Sir	735	” said the Major . “
150862	150879	150859	150860	a boy	9790	” Mr Dombey ’s eyes sought the ground , and a shade came over his face . “
150886	150891	150884	150884	Sir	735	” pursued the Major . “
150902	150903	150884	150884	Sir	735	” “
150906	150915	150884	150884	Sir	735	” said Mr Dombey , raising his head . “
150934	150939	150884	150884	Sir	735	” said the Major . “
150980	151009	150978	150978	Bagstock	298	” The Major heaved his shoulders , and his cheeks , and laughed more like an over - fed Mephistopheles than ever , as he said the words . “
151020	151026	151011	151012	the lady	9737	” said Mr Dombey coldly . “
151032	151037	151030	151030	Sir	735	” said the Major , “
151072	151090	151068	151068	Sir	735	” Mr Dombey seemed , by his face , to think no worse of her for that . “
151099	151104	151068	151068	Sir	735	” said the Major . “
151136	151385	151126	151127	Old Joe	290	” With this tribute to the character of his ally , which seemed to be wrung from him by the force of circumstances and the irresistible tendency of their conversation , the Major closed the subject , and glided into a general exposition of the extent to which he had been beloved and doted on by splendid women and brilliant creatures . On the next day but one , Mr Dombey and the Major encountered the Honourable Mrs Skewton and her daughter in the Pump - room ; on the day after , they met them again very near the place where they had met them first . After meeting them thus , three or four times in all , it became a point of mere civility to old acquaintances that the Major should go there one evening . Mr Dombey had not originally intended to pay visits , but on the Major announcing this intention , he said he would have the pleasure of accompanying him . So the Major told the Native to go round before dinner , and say , with his and Mr Dombey ’s compliments , that they would have the honour of visiting the ladies that same evening , if the ladies were alone . In answer to which message , the Native brought back a very small note with a very large quantity of scent about it , indited by the Honourable Mrs Skewton to Major Bagstock , and briefly saying , “
151410	151415	151416	151416	you	3689	” which was underlined , “
151431	151805	151806	151806	I	0	” The Honourable Mrs Skewton and her daughter , Mrs Granger , resided , while at Leamington , in lodgings that were fashionable enough and dear enough , but rather limited in point of space and conveniences ; so that the Honourable Mrs Skewton , being in bed , had her feet in the window and her head in the fireplace , while the Honourable Mrs Skewton ’s maid was quartered in a closet within the drawing - room , so extremely small , that , to avoid developing the whole of its accommodations , she was obliged to writhe in and out of the door like a beautiful serpent . Withers , the wan page , slept out of the house immediately under the tiles at a neighbouring milk - shop ; and the wheeled chair , which was the stone of that young Sisyphus , passed the night in a shed belonging to the same dairy , where new - laid eggs were produced by the poultry connected with the establishment , who roosted on a broken donkey - cart , persuaded , to all appearance , that it grew there , and was a species of tree . Mr Dombey and the Major found Mrs Skewton arranged , as Cleopatra , among the cushions of a sofa : very airily dressed ; and certainly not resembling Shakespeare ’s Cleopatra , whom age could not wither . On their way upstairs they had heard the sound of a harp , but it had ceased on their being announced , and Edith now stood beside it handsomer and haughtier than ever . It was a remarkable characteristic of this lady ’s beauty that it appeared to vaunt and assert itself without her aid , and against her will . She knew that she was beautiful : it was impossible that it could be otherwise : but she seemed with her own pride to defy her very self . Whether she held cheap attractions that could only call forth admiration that was worthless to her , or whether she designed to render them more precious to admirers by this usage of them , those to whom they were precious seldom paused to consider . “
151812	151823	151806	151806	I	0	” said Mr Dombey , advancing a step towards her , “
151835	151836	151837	151837	You	431	” “
151842	151843	151837	151837	You	431	” “
151856	151860	151846	151846	you	431	” said Cleopatra . “
151873	151927	151869	151869	my	0	” The exquisite indifference of her manner in saying this : an indifference quite removed from dulness or insensibility , for it was pointed with proud purpose : was well set off by the carelessness with which she drew her hand across the strings , and came from that part of the room . “
151935	151948	151932	151933	Mr Dombey	190	” said her languishing mother , playing with a hand - screen , “
151960	151961	151953	151953	Edith	429	” “
151969	151973	151967	151967	Mama	212	” said Edith . “
151991	152015	151967	151967	Mama	212	” returned her mother , making a faint attempt to pat her with the screen , which Edith made no movement to meet , “
152073	152085	152086	152086	We	3695	” Mr Dombey said it was very true , very true . “
152097	152108	152113	152113	Ma’am	219	” said Mrs Skewton . Mr Dombey thought it possible . “
152115	152120	152113	152113	Ma’am	219	” said the Major . “
152133	152163	152208	152209	Mrs Skewton	430	J.B.“s — tough and blunt old Joes , Ma’am , plain red herrings with hard roes , Sir — we could n’t afford it . It would n’t do . ”
152164	152169	152171	152172	Mrs Skewton	430	“ You naughty Infidel , ”
152174	152178	152171	152172	Mrs Skewton	430	“ be mute . ”
152179	152183	152185	152186	the Major	1679	“ Cleopatra commands , ”
152192	152198	152185	152186	the Major	1679	“ and Antony Bagstock obeys . ”
152199	152206	152208	152209	Mrs Skewton	430	“ The man has no sensitiveness , ”
152226	152257	152259	152260	Mrs Skewton	430	“ No sympathy . And what do we live for but sympathy ! What else is so extremely charming ! Without that gleam of sunshine on our cold cold earth , ”
152284	152298	152273	152273	her	430	“ how could we possibly bear it ? In short , obdurate man ! ”
152308	152338	152273	152273	her	430	“ I would have my world all heart ; and Faith is so excessively charming , that I wo n’t allow you to disturb it , do you hear ? ”
152427	152439	152441	152442	Mr Dombey	190	“ There is not much company here , it would seem ? ”
152451	152460	152445	152445	his	190	“ I believe not . We see none . ”
152461	152465	152467	152468	Mrs Skewton	430	“ Why really , ”
152473	152488	152467	152468	Mrs Skewton	430	“ there are no people here just now with whom we care to associate . ”
152489	152496	152498	152498	Edith	429	“ They have not enough heart , ”
152520	152530	152536	152536	her	718	“ My dearest Edith rallies me , you see ! ”
152561	152565	152532	152533	her mother	718	“ Wicked one ! ”
152566	152579	152581	152582	Mr Dombey	190	“ You have been here before , if I am not mistaken ? ”
152588	152601	152581	152582	Mr Dombey	190	“ Oh , several times . I think we have been everywhere . ”
152602	152607	152532	152533	her mother	718	“ A beautiful country ! ”
152608	152618	152581	152582	Mr Dombey	190	“ I suppose it is . Everybody says so . ”
152619	152629	152631	152632	her mother	718	“ Your cousin Feenix raves about it , Edith , ”
152680	152700	152701	152701	she	718	“ I hope , for the credit of my good taste , that I am tired of the neighbourhood , ”
152704	152714	152715	152715	he	190	“ You have almost reason to be , Madam , ”
152749	152759	152760	152760	She	11069	“ if these beautiful productions are from your hand . ”
152776	152782	152784	152785	Mr Dombey	190	“ Have they that interest ? ”
152787	152792	152784	152785	Mr Dombey	190	“ Are they yours ? ”
152793	152796	152760	152760	She	11069	“ Yes . ”
152797	152806	152760	152760	She	11069	“ And you play , I already know . ”
152807	152810	152784	152785	Mr Dombey	190	“ Yes . ”
152811	152815	152760	152760	She	11069	“ And sing ? ”
152816	152819	152760	152760	She	11069	“ Yes . ”
152903	152913	152915	152916	Mr Dombey	190	“ You have many resources against weariness at least , ”
152918	152925	152926	152926	she	11069	“ Whatever their efficiency may be , ”
152929	152941	152926	152926	she	11069	“ you know them all now . I have no more . ”
152942	152951	152953	152954	Mr Dombey	190	“ May I hope to prove them all ? ”
152974	152983	152984	152984	She	11069	“ Oh certainly ! If you desire it ! ”
153103	153118	153120	153120	Cleopatra	432	“ We are going to have some music , Mr Dombey , I hope ? ”
153122	153133	153135	153136	Mr Dombey	190	“ Mrs Granger has been kind enough to promise so , ”
153138	153152	153135	153136	Mr Dombey	190	“ Ah ! That ’s very nice . Do you propose , Major ? ”
153153	153158	153160	153161	the Major	1679	“ No , Ma’am , ”
153163	153169	153160	153161	the Major	1679	“ Could n’t do it . ”
153170	153177	153179	153180	the lady	9737	“ You ’re a barbarous being , ”
153182	153198	153179	153180	the lady	9737	“ and my hand ’s destroyed . You are fond of music , Mr Dombey ? ”
153199	153203	153205	153206	Mr Dombey	190	“ Eminently so , ”
153210	153218	153220	153220	Cleopatra	432	“ Yes . It ’s very nice , ”
153227	153257	153259	153259	Cleopatra	432	“ So much heart in it — undeveloped recollections of a previous state of existence — and all that — which is so truly charming . Do you know , ”
153278	153332	153274	153274	his	190	“ that if anything could tempt me to put a period to my life , it would be curiosity to find out what it ’s all about , and what it means ; there are so many provoking mysteries , really , that are hidden from us . Major , you to play ! ”
154274	154281	154283	154283	his	274	“ Why do you answer it ? ”
154289	154301	154315	154316	the Manager	11470	“ The messenger is out , and I am the next , ”
154307	154313	154315	154316	the Manager	11470	“ You are the next ? ”
154318	154327	154315	154316	the Manager	11470	“ Yes ! Creditable to me ! There ! ”
154361	154371	154373	154374	the brother	11529	“ I am sorry to trouble you , James , ”
154380	154383	154373	154374	the brother	11529	“ but — ”
154384	154399	154400	154401	Mr Carker	274	“ Oh ! you have something to say . I knew that . Well ? ”
154428	154431	154432	154432	he	11470	“ Well ? ”
154436	154443	154432	154432	he	11470	“ I am uneasy about Harriet . ”
154444	154458	154402	154403	the Manager	11470	“ Harriet who ? what Harriet ? I know nobody of that name . ”
154459	154473	154488	154489	the Manager	11470	“ She is not well , and has changed very much of late . ”
154474	154486	154488	154489	the Manager	11470	“ She changed very much , a great many years ago , ”
154491	154501	154488	154489	the Manager	11470	“ and that is all I have to say . “
154510	154520	154522	154523	the Manager	11470	“ Why should I hear you , Brother John ? ”
154546	154576	154537	154537	his	11470	“ I tell you , Harriet Carker made her choice many years ago between her two brothers . She may repent it , but she must abide by it . ”
154577	154606	154608	154609	the other	10537	“ Do n’t mistake me . I do not say she does repent it . It would be black ingratitude in me to hint at such a thing , ”
154611	154628	154608	154609	the other	10537	“ Though believe me , James , I am as sorry for her sacrifice as you . ”
154629	154633	154635	154636	the Manager	11470	“ As I ? ”
154638	154642	154635	154636	the Manager	11470	“ As I ? ”
154643	154664	154666	154667	the Junior	236	“ As sorry for her choice — for what you call her choice — as you are angry at it , ”
154669	154672	154674	154675	the other	10537	“ Angry ? ”
154685	154707	154682	154682	his	10537	“ Displeased . Whatever word you like best . You know my meaning . There is no offence in my intention . ”
154708	154717	154719	154720	his brother	683	“ There is offence in everything you do , ”
154744	154789	154719	154720	his brother	683	“ Carry those papers away , if you please . I am busy . His politeness was so much more cutting than his wrath , that the Junior went to the door . But stopping at it , and looking round , he said : “
154884	154910	154876	154876	she	445	” The Manager inclined his head , and showed his teeth , as who should say , in answer to some careless small - talk , “
154919	154926	154927	154927	We	3763	” but said never a word . “
154954	154959	154939	154939	she	445	” pursued the other . “
155006	155023	154996	154996	her	445	” Again the Manager inclined his head and showed his teeth , and seemed to say , “
155032	155041	155027	155027	You	3760	” And again he uttered never a word . “
155047	155054	155043	155043	I	0	” said John Carker , mildly . “
155059	155065	155043	155043	I	0	” replied his smiling brother . “
155073	155103	155043	155043	I	0	” John Carker , with a sigh , was passing slowly out at the door , when his brother ’s voice detained him for a moment on the threshold . “
155117	155139	155140	155140	you	0	” he said , throwing the still unfolded letter on his desk , and putting his hands firmly in his pockets , “
155189	155196	155204	155204	her	445	” he smiled very sweetly here ; “
155200	155201	155202	155202	I	0	” “
155247	155248	155242	155242	we	3764	” “
155257	155262	155264	155264	yourself	0	” returned the other , “
155315	155453	155454	155454	I	0	” Mr Carker the Manager took up the letter again , and waved it with a smile of mock courtesy towards the door . Unfolding it as his brother withdrew , and looking darkly after him as he left the room , he once more turned round in his elbow - chair , and applied himself to a diligent perusal of its contents . It was in the writing of his great chief , Mr Dombey , and dated from Leamington . Though he was a quick reader of all other letters , Mr Carker read this slowly ; weighing the words as he went , and bringing every tooth in his head to bear upon them . When he had read it through once , he turned it over again , and picked out these passages . “
155475	155476	155477	155477	I	0	” “
155507	155508	155509	155509	I	0	” “
155558	155559	155553	155553	I	0	” “
155565	155586	155553	155553	I	0	” said Mr Carker the Manager , expanding his mouth , as if it were made of India - rubber : “
155593	155614	155615	155615	I	0	” Still that passage , which was in a postscript , attracted his attention and his teeth , once more . “
155618	155622	155615	155615	I	0	” he said , “
155650	155741	155626	155627	Captain Cuttle	250	” He refolded the letter , and was sitting trifling with it , standing it long - wise and broad - wise on his table , and turning it over and over on all sides — doing pretty much the same thing , perhaps , by its contents — when Mr Perch the messenger knocked softly at the door , and coming in on tiptoe , bending his body at every step as if it were the delight of his life to bow , laid some papers on the table . “
155751	155800	155743	155743	you	0	” asked Mr Perch , rubbing his hands , and deferentially putting his head on one side , like a man who felt he had no business to hold it up in such a presence , and would keep it as much out of the way as possible . “
155805	155806	155743	155743	you	0	” “
155811	155821	155809	155809	Sir	735	” said Mr Perch , in a soft voice , “
155876	155891	155867	155867	you	735	” Mr Perch coughed once behind his hand , and waited for further orders . “
155895	155896	155892	155893	Anybody else	9785	” “
155901	155906	155899	155899	Sir	735	” said Mr Perch , “
155957	155968	155955	155955	Sir	735	” added Mr Perch , stopping to shut the door , “
155991	155992	155993	155993	You	735	” “
156007	156023	156003	156003	you	735	” asked Mr Carker , leaning back in his chair and looking at that officer . “
156028	156039	156040	156040	his	3786	” said Mr Perch , coughing behind his hand again , “
156079	156089	156055	156055	he	3786	” Mr Perch shook his head very dubiously indeed . “
156098	156103	156092	156092	he	3786	” asked Mr Carker . “
156108	156137	156138	156138	his	3786	” said Mr Perch , coughing another cough behind his hand , which was always his resource as an expression of humility when nothing else occurred to him , “
156169	156217	156164	156164	you	735	” added Perch , dropping his voice to a whisper , and turning , in the inviolable nature of his confidence , to give the door a thrust with his hand and knee , as if that would shut it any more when it was shut already , “
156272	156277	156266	156266	I	0	” observed Mr Perch , “
156334	156352	156308	156308	I	0	” Mr Carker grinned at him like a shark , but in an absent , thoughtful manner . “
156355	156369	156308	156308	I	0	” submitted Mr Perch , after a short silence , and another cough , “
156408	156413	156414	156414	I	0	” said Mr Perch , “
156446	156447	156439	156439	I	0	” “
156456	156461	156454	156454	Perch	366	” said Mr Carker . “
156466	156467	156470	156470	Sir	735	” “
156478	156488	156476	156476	Sir	735	” said Mr Perch , hesitating at the door , “
156498	156499	156489	156489	he	3811	” “
156524	156636	156512	156512	I	0	” Mr Perch bowed ; and shutting the door , as precisely and carefully as if he were not coming back for a week , went on his quest among the sparrows in the court . While he was gone , Mr Carker assumed his favourite attitude before the fire - place , and stood looking at the door ; presenting , with his under lip tucked into the smile that showed his whole row of upper teeth , a singularly crouching apace . The messenger was not long in returning , followed by a pair of heavy boots that came bumping along the passage like boxes . With the unceremonious words “
156640	156844	156849	156849	You	735	you!”—a very unusual form of introduction from his lips — Mr Perch then ushered into the presence a strong - built lad of fifteen , with a round red face , a round sleek head , round black eyes , round limbs , and round body , who , to carry out the general rotundity of his appearance , had a round hat in his hand , without a particle of brim to it . Obedient to a nod from Mr Carker , Perch had no sooner confronted the visitor with that gentleman than he withdrew . The moment they were face to face alone , Mr Carker , without a word of preparation , took him by the throat , and shook him until his head seemed loose upon his shoulders . The boy , who in the midst of his astonishment could not help staring wildly at the gentleman with so many white teeth who was choking him , and at the office walls , as though determined , if he were choked , that his last look should be at the mysteries for his intrusion into which he was paying such a severe penalty , at last contrived to utter — “
156857	156858	156849	156849	You	735	” “
156863	156868	156849	156849	You	735	” said Mr Carker . “
156879	156891	156877	156877	I	0	” There was no doubt of that , and tightly too . “
156895	156905	156877	156877	I	0	” said Mr Carker , through his set jaws , “
156911	157000	156906	156906	I	0	” Biler whimpered , would he though ? oh no he wouldn’t — and what was he doing of — and why did n’t he strangle some — body of his own size and not him : but Biler was quelled by the extraordinary nature of his reception , and , as his head became stationary , and he looked the gentleman in the face , or rather in the teeth , and saw him snarling at him , he so far forgot his manhood as to cry . “
157011	157025	157009	157009	Sir	735	” said Biler , otherwise Rob , otherwise Grinder , and always Toodle . “
157030	157049	157009	157009	Sir	735	” replied Mr Carker , slowly releasing him , and moving back a step into his favourite position . “
157060	157061	157052	157052	you	0	” “
157071	157092	157069	157069	Sir	735	” whimpered Rob , putting one hand to his throat , and the knuckles of the other to his eyes . “
157106	157107	157101	157101	I	0	” “
157116	157125	157111	157111	Cain	447	” repeated Mr Carker , eyeing him narrowly . “
157135	157216	157128	157128	you	0	” The impeachment , while it much affected Mr Toodle Junior , attached to his character so justly , that he could not say a word in denial . He stood looking at the gentleman , therefore , with a frightened , self - convicted , and remorseful air . As to his looking at him , it may be observed that he was fascinated by Mr Carker , and never took his round eyes off him for an instant . “
157223	157237	157220	157221	a thief	3823	” said Mr Carker , with his hands behind him in his pockets . “
157242	157246	157247	157247	You	0	” pleaded Rob . “
157250	157255	157247	157247	You	0	” said Mr Carker . “
157263	157267	157261	157261	Sir	735	” whimpered Rob . “
157317	157329	157312	157313	a cove	3829	” said Mr Toodle Junior , with a burst of penitence , “
157355	157397	157398	157398	I	0	” They seemed to have brought him down to a velveteen jacket and trousers very much the worse for wear , a particularly small red waistcoat like a gorget , an interval of blue check , and the hat before mentioned . “
157414	157418	157409	157409	their	3831	” said Rob , “
157441	157458	157438	157438	I	0	” said Biler , blubbering outright , and smearing his eyes with his coat - cuff , “
157472	157526	157460	157460	I	0	” All of which , including his expression of surprise at not having achieved this last scarce performance , the boy said , just as if the teeth of Mr Carker drew it out of him , and he had no power of concealing anything with that battery of attraction in full play . “
157534	157545	157529	157532	a nice young gentleman	3835	” said Mr Carker , shaking his head at him . “
157559	157560	157529	157532	a nice young gentleman	3835	” “
157567	157586	157561	157561	I	0	” returned the wretched Biler , blubbering again , and again having recourse to his coat - cuff : “
157619	157620	157612	157612	I	0	” “
157624	157629	157666	157666	Sir	735	” said Mr Carker . “
157638	157639	157641	157641	you	735	” “
157652	157657	157641	157641	you	735	” said Mr Carker . “
157668	157677	157666	157666	Sir	735	” returned the quondam Grinder , much affected . “
157712	157713	157700	157700	I	0	” “
157721	157750	157715	157715	you	735	” said Mr Carker , taking him by the throat again , holding him out at arm’s - length , and surveying him in silence for some moments , “
157760	157761	157758	157758	you	735	” “
157772	157815	157770	157770	Sir	735	” returned Toodle Junior , faintly . Mr Carker the Manager pushed him backward into a corner — the boy submitting quietly , hardly venturing to breathe , and never once removing his eyes from his face — and rang the bell . “
157823	157847	157848	157849	Mr Gills	248	” Mr Perch was too deferential to express surprise or recognition of the figure in the corner : and Uncle Sol appeared immediately . “
157851	157859	157770	157770	Sir	735	” said Carker , with a smile , “
157878	157879	157875	157875	I	0	” “
157885	157906	157883	157883	Sir	735	” returned Uncle Sol , taking out his pocket - book , and handing over some notes as he spoke . “
157922	157923	157920	157920	Sir	735	” “
157934	157964	157924	157924	You	248	” replied the smiling Manager , taking a paper from one of his many drawers , and making an endorsement on it , while Uncle Sol looked over him , “
157975	157976	157931	157932	Mr Gills	248	” “
157994	158011	157992	157992	Sir	735	” said Uncle Sol , with a slight addition to the usual tremor in his voice . “
158021	158025	158012	158015	The Son and Heir	2625	” returned Carker . “
158048	158049	158050	158050	She	2625	” “
158059	158064	158054	158054	I	0	” said old Sol . “
158074	158094	158095	158096	Mr Gills	248	” assented Mr Carker in that voiceless manner of his : which made the observant young Toodle tremble again . “
158098	158110	158095	158096	Mr Gills	248	” he added aloud , throwing himself back in his chair , “
158119	158136	158137	158138	Mr Gills	248	” Uncle Sol , standing by him , shook his head and heaved a deep sigh . “
158140	158164	158137	158138	Mr Gills	248	” said Carker , with his soft hand playing round his mouth , and looking up into the Instrument - maker ’s face , “
158206	158223	158252	158253	Mr Gills	248	” he added quickly , in anticipation of what the old man was going to say , “
158260	158341	158257	158258	the lad	1626	” Sol Gills pulled down his spectacles from his forehead to his eyes , and looked at Toodle Junior standing upright in the corner : his head presenting the appearance ( which it always did ) of having been newly drawn out of a bucket of cold water ; his small waistcoat rising and falling quickly in the play of his emotions ; and his eyes intently fixed on Mr Carker , without the least reference to his proposed master . “
158353	158455	158343	158343	you	248	” said the Manager . Old Sol , without being quite enthusiastic on the subject , replied that he was glad of any opportunity , however slight , to oblige Mr Carker , whose wish on such a point was a command : and that the wooden Midshipman would consider himself happy to receive in his berth any visitor of Mr Carker ’s selecting . Mr Carker bared himself to the tops and bottoms of his gums : making the watchful Toodle Junior tremble more and more : and acknowledged the Instrument - maker ’s politeness in his most affable manner . “
158468	158483	158465	158466	Mr Gills	248	” he answered , rising , and shaking the old man by the hand , “
158512	158527	158509	158510	Mr Gills	248	” here he smiled a wide smile at Rob , who shook before it : “
158599	158652	158655	158655	boy	10057	” His smile at parting was so full of teeth , that it confused old Sol , and made him vaguely uncomfortable . He went home , thinking of raging seas , foundering ships , drowning men , an ancient bottle of Madeira never brought to light , and other dismal matters . “
158657	158682	158655	158655	boy	10057	” said Mr Carker , putting his hand on young Toodle ’s shoulder , and bringing him out into the middle of the room . “
158688	158692	158683	158683	You	248	” Rob said , “
158697	158698	158695	158695	Sir	735	” “
158703	158708	158700	158700	you	248	” pursued his patron , “
158738	158757	158720	158720	you	248	” There was nothing in any branch of mental acquisition that Rob seemed to understand better than that . “
158765	158770	158759	158759	you	248	” said Mr Carker , “
158823	158939	158942	158942	they	3869	” Rob repeated it slowly , as Mr Carker wrote it down . Rob even spelt it over a second time , letter by letter , as if he thought that the omission of a dot or scratch would lead to his destruction . Mr Carker then handed him out of the room ; and Rob , keeping his round eyes fixed upon his patron to the last , vanished for the time being . Mr Carker the Manager did a great deal of business in the course of the day , and bestowed his teeth upon a great many people . In the office , in the court , in the street , and on “
159356	159361	159363	159364	Mr Carker	274	“ Now , Sir , ”
159372	159376	159363	159364	Mr Carker	274	“ come along ! ”
159579	159594	159570	159570	herself	218	“ Oh Rob , my poor boy , what have you done at last ! ”
159595	159600	159602	159602	Rob	424	“ Nothing , mother , ”
159609	159614	159602	159602	Rob	424	“ ask the gentleman ! ”
159615	159621	159623	159624	Mr Carker	274	“ Do n’t be alarmed , ”
159626	159634	159623	159624	Mr Carker	274	“ I want to do him good . ”
159711	159715	159717	159718	Mr Carker	274	“ This fellow , ”
159728	159737	159717	159718	Mr Carker	274	“ is your son , eh , Ma’am ? ”
159738	159743	159745	159745	Polly	218	“ Yes , Sir , ”
159751	159756	159745	159745	Polly	218	“ yes , Sir . ”
159757	159766	159768	159769	Mr Carker	274	“ A bad son , I am afraid ? ”
159771	159781	159783	159783	Polly	218	“ Never a bad son to me , Sir , ”
159785	159790	159792	159793	Mr Carker	274	“ To whom then ? ”
159795	159805	159807	159807	Polly	218	“ He has been a little wild , Sir , ”
159834	159861	159810	159811	the baby	9770	“ and has gone with wrong companions : but I hope he has seen the misery of that , Sir , and will do well again . ”
159911	159924	159925	159925	he	274	“ Your husband , I take it , is not at home ? ”
159928	159933	159935	159935	Polly	218	“ No , Sir , ”
159937	159946	159935	159935	Polly	218	“ He ’s down the line at present . ”
159998	160001	160003	160004	Mr Carker	274	“ Then , ”
160006	160036	160003	160004	Mr Carker	274	“ I ’ll tell you how I have stumbled on this boy of yours , and who I am , and what I am going to do for him . ”
160435	160452	160454	160454	Rob	424	“ I ’ll try hard , dear mother , now . Upon my soul I will ! ”
160456	160477	160479	160479	Polly	218	“ Oh do , my dear boy ! I am sure you will , for our sakes and your own ! ”
160484	160503	160479	160479	Polly	218	“ But you ’re coming back to speak to me , when you have seen the gentleman away ? ”
160504	160512	160513	160513	Rob	424	“ I do n’t know , mother . ”
160520	160529	160513	160513	Rob	424	“ Father — when ’s he coming home ? ”
160530	160540	160479	160479	Polly	218	“ Not till two o’clock to - morrow morning . ”
160541	160550	160552	160552	Rob	424	“ I ’ll come back , mother dear ! ”
160577	160580	160582	160583	Mr Carker	274	“ What ! ”
160590	160600	160582	160583	Mr Carker	274	“ You have a bad father , have you ? ”
160601	160606	160608	160608	Rob	424	“ No , Sir ! ”
160612	160628	160608	160608	Rob	424	“ There ai n’t a better nor a kinder father going , than mine is . ”
160629	160640	160642	160643	his patron	12854	“ Why do n’t you want to see him then ? ”
160645	160660	160662	160662	Rob	424	“ There ’s such a difference between a father and a mother , Sir , ”
160670	160719	160662	160662	Rob	424	“ He could n’t hardly believe yet that I was doing to do better — though I know he ’d try to — but a mother — she always believes what ’s good , Sir ; at least , I know my mother does , God bless her ! ”
160769	160810	160766	160766	he	274	“ You ’ll come to me tomorrow morning , and you shall be shown where that old gentleman lives ; that old gentleman who was with me this morning ; where you are going , as you heard me say . ”
160811	160816	160818	160818	Rob	424	“ Yes , Sir , ”
160820	160848	160849	160849	he	274	“ I have a great interest in that old gentleman , and in serving him , you serve me , boy , do you understand ? Well , ”
160868	160918	160849	160849	he	274	“ I see you do . I want to know all about that old gentleman , and how he goes on from day to day — for I am anxious to be of service to him — and especially who comes there to see him . Do you understand ? ”
160927	160932	160919	160919	Rob	424	“ Yes , Sir , ”
160935	161010	160919	160919	Rob	424	“ I should like to know that he has friends who are attentive to him , and that they do n’t desert him — for he lives very much alone now , poor fellow ; but that they are fond of him , and of his nephew who has gone abroad . There is a very young lady who may perhaps come to see him . I want particularly to know all about her . ”
161011	161019	161021	161022	the boy	10021	“ I ’ll take care , Sir , ”
161024	161029	161031	161031	his	10021	“ And take care , ”
161060	161074	161057	161057	his	12854	“ take care you talk about affairs of mine to nobody but me . ”
161075	161084	161086	161086	Rob	424	“ To nobody in the world , Sir , ”
161092	161096	161098	161099	Mr Carker	274	“ Neither there , ”
161110	161131	161136	161136	his	424	“ nor anywhere else . I ’ll try how true and grateful you can be . I ’ll prove you ! ”
161466	161472	161480	161480	his	274	“ A very young lady ! ”
161483	161523	161480	161480	his	274	“ Ay ! when I saw her last , she was a little child . With dark eyes and hair , I recollect , and a good face ; a very good face ! I daresay she ’s pretty . ”
161671	161674	161676	161676	he	504	“ which , ”
161703	161712	161715	161715	himself	504	“ the executors could n’t keep him out of ”
162110	162116	162119	162120	Mr Toots	504	“ Oh ! Good morning ! ”
162128	162133	162136	162137	Mr Toots	504	“ For Mr Dombey , ”
162149	162154	162161	162161	he	504	“ For Miss Dombey , ”
162193	162201	162202	162203	Mr Toots	504	“ Oh , I beg your pardon , ”
162217	162225	162202	162203	Mr Toots	504	“ Is the young woman at home ? ”
162285	162292	162293	162294	Mr Toots	504	“ Oh ! How de do ? ”
162317	162324	162327	162328	Mr Toots	504	“ How ’s Diogenes going on ? ”
162372	162381	162348	162349	Mr Toots	504	“ Miss Florence is quite well , Sir , ”
162386	162397	162382	162382	Susan	241	“ Oh , it ’s of no consequence , thank’ee , ”
162554	162558	162544	162544	he	504	“ For when I gaze,”—the
162744	162750	162739	162739	his	504	“ Go in and win , ”

162929	162940	162942	162942	Susan	241	“ Perhaps you ’d like to walk upstairs , Sir ! ”
162944	162954	162956	162957	Mr Toots	504	“ Well , I think I will come in ! ”
162992	162998	163000	163000	Susan	241	“ Go along with you ! ”
163002	163010	163000	163000	Susan	241	“ or Ill tear your eyes out . ”
163011	163015	163017	163018	Mr Toots	504	“ Just another ! ”
163020	163026	163028	163028	Susan	241	“ Go along with you ! ”
163034	163051	163000	163000	Susan	241	“ Innocents like you , too ! Who ’ll begin next ? Go along , Sir ! ”
163309	163317	163319	163320	Mr Carker	274	“ I beg your pardon , Sir , ”
163331	163339	163326	163326	his	274	“ I hope you are not hurt ? ”
163340	163347	163349	163350	Mr Toots	504	“ Oh no , thank you , ”
163357	163363	163353	163353	his	504	“ it ’s of no consequence ”

163405	163411	163413	163414	Mr Toots	504	“ No , thank you , ”
163416	163431	163413	163414	Mr Toots	504	“ it ’s all quite right . It ’s very comfortable , thank you . ”
163432	163442	163444	163444	Carker	274	“ I have the pleasure of knowing Mr Dombey , ”
163446	163451	163444	163444	Carker	274	“ Have you though ? ”
163456	163472	163474	163475	Mr Carker	274	“ And you will allow me , perhaps , to apologise , in his absence , ”
163482	163498	163474	163475	Mr Carker	274	“ for such a misadventure , and to wonder how it can possibly have happened . ”
163945	163954	163976	163976	boys	703	“ Who enter here , leave light behind ! ”
166277	166287	166289	166289	Susan	241	“ Better late than never , dear Miss Floy , ”
166291	166310	166289	166289	Susan	241	“ and I do say , that even a visit to them old Skettleses will be a Godsend . ”
166311	166325	166327	166327	Florence	197	“ It is very good of Sir Barnet and Lady Skettles , Susan , ”
166346	166354	166327	166327	Florence	197	“ to repeat their invitation so kindly . ”
166435	166448	166450	166451	Miss Nipper	241	“ They know what they ’re about , if ever people did , ”
166457	166466	166450	166451	Miss Nipper	241	“ oh ! trust them Skettleses for that ! ”
166467	166483	166485	166485	Florence	197	“ I am not very anxious to go to Fulham , Susan , I confess , ”
166488	166504	166485	166485	Florence	197	“ but it will be right to go . I think it will be better . ”
166505	166509	166511	166511	Susan	241	“ Much better , ”
166521	166525	166527	166527	Florence	197	“ And so , ”
166529	166570	166527	166527	Florence	197	“ though I would prefer to have gone when there was no one there , instead of in this vacation time , when it seems there are some young people staying in the house , I have thankfully said yes . ”
166571	166586	166588	166588	Susan	241	“ For which _ I _ say , Miss Floy , Oh be joyful ! ”
166590	166597	166588	166588	Susan	241	“ Ah ! h — h ! ”
166685	166700	166702	166702	Florence	197	“ How long it is before we have any news of Walter , Susan ! ”
166710	166717	166719	166720	her maid	10006	“ Long indeed , Miss Floy ! ”
166722	166744	166746	166746	Susan	241	“ And Perch said , when he came just now to see for letters — but what signifies what he says ! ”
166753	166760	166746	166746	Susan	241	“ Much he knows about it ! ”
166774	166780	166782	166783	Susan Nipper	241	“ If I had n’t , ”
166820	166903	166815	166816	Mr Perch	366	“ if I had n’t more manliness than that insipidest of his sex , I ’d never take pride in my hair again , but turn it up behind my ears , and wear coarse caps , without a bit of border , until death released me from my insignificance . I may not be a Amazon , Miss Floy , and would n’t so demean myself by such disfigurement , but anyways I ’m not a giver up , I hope . ”
166904	166910	166912	166912	Florence	197	“ Give up ! What ? ”
166920	166927	166929	166929	Susan	241	“ Why , nothing , Miss , ”
166931	166988	166929	166929	Susan	241	“ Good gracious , nothing ! It ’s only that wet curl - paper of a man , Perch , that anyone might almost make away with , with a touch , and really it would be a blessed event for all parties if someone would take pity on him , and would have the goodness ! ”
166989	166999	167001	167001	Florence	197	“ Does he give up the ship , Susan ? ”
167006	167011	167013	167013	Susan	241	“ No , Miss , ”
167015	167095	167097	167098	Miss Nipper	241	“ I should like to see him make so bold as do it to my face ! No , Miss , but he goes on about some bothering ginger that Mr Walter was to send to Mrs Perch , and shakes his dismal head , and says he hopes it may be coming ; anyhow , he says , it ca n’t come now in time for the intended occasion , but may do for next , which really , ”
167104	167133	167135	167135	Susan	241	“ puts me out of patience with the man , for though I can bear a great deal , I am not a camel , neither am I , ”
167143	167153	167135	167135	Susan	241	“ if I know myself , a dromedary neither . ”
167154	167163	167165	167165	Florence	197	“ What else does he say , Susan ? ”
167169	167176	167165	167165	Florence	197	“ Wo n’t you tell me ? ”
167177	167193	167195	167195	Susan	241	“ As if I would n’t tell you anything , Miss Floy , and everything ! ”
167197	167267	167195	167195	Susan	241	“ Why , nothing Miss , he says that there begins to be a general talk about the ship , and that they have never had a ship on that voyage half so long unheard of , and that the Captain ’s wife was at the office yesterday , and seemed a little put out about it , but anyone could say that , we knew nearly that before . ”
167268	167276	167278	167278	Florence	197	“ I must visit Walter ’s uncle , ”
167282	167306	167307	167308	Miss Nipper	241	“ before I leave home . I will go and see him this morning . Let us walk there , directly , Susan . ”
167767	167775	167777	167777	Susan	241	“ Mrs Richards ’s eldest , Miss ! ”
167779	167789	167777	167777	Susan	241	“ and the worrit of Mrs Richards ’s life ! ”
167862	167871	167849	167849	his	4140	“ Strays ! Whoo - oop ! Strays ! ”
167943	167952	167916	167917	Mrs Richards	227	“ Strays ! Whoo - oop ! Strays ! ”
167979	168001	168003	168003	Susan	241	“ Is this the way you show your penitence , when Mrs Richards has been fretting for you months and months ? ”
168009	168015	168016	168016	Rob	424	“ Where ’s Mr Gills ? ”
168058	168059	168053	168054	Mr Gills	248	” “
168064	168072	168053	168054	Mr Gills	248	” said Miss Nipper , with authority , “
168082	168083	168084	168084	I	0	” “
168093	168097	168084	168084	I	0	” said Rob . “
168103	168111	168100	168100	your	197	” cried Susan , with stinging sharpness . “
168129	168135	168162	168162	Miss	4154	” whimpered the baited Rob . “
168143	168144	168138	168138	you	197	” “
168155	168159	168146	168147	Mr Gills	248	” asked Florence . “
168164	168178	168162	168162	Miss	4154	” replied Rob , with another application of his knuckles to his hair . “
168200	168201	168199	168199	Miss.	238	” “
168210	168214	168217	168217	Miss	10202	” inquired Susan . “
168219	168233	168237	168237	he	248	” returned Rob , preferring to address himself to Florence and slighting Nipper ; “
168281	168318	168269	168269	He	248	” said Rob , stooping to get a glimpse of the pigeons through the window , and checking himself , with his fingers half - way to his mouth , on the verge of another whistle . “
168332	168342	168329	168330	Captain Cuttle	250	” inquired Florence , after a moment ’s reflection . “
168350	168374	168329	168330	Captain Cuttle	250	” rejoined Rob , with an illustrative twist of his left hand . Yes , Miss. He was here the day before yesterday . ”
168375	168383	168385	168385	Susan	241	“ Has he not been here since ? ”
168387	168392	168394	168394	Rob	424	“ No , Miss , ”
168403	168414	168416	168416	Florence	197	“ Perhaps Walter ’s Uncle has gone there , Susan , ”
168422	168430	168432	168432	Rob	424	“ To Captain Cuttle ’s , Miss ? ”
168434	168481	168432	168432	Rob	424	“ no , he ’s not gone there , Miss. Because he left particular word that if Captain Cuttle called , I should tell him how surprised he was , not to have seen him yesterday , and should make him stop till he came back . ”
168482	168491	168493	168493	Florence	197	“ Do you know where Captain Cuttle lives ? ”
169214	169222	169224	169224	Florence	197	“ I beg your pardon , Ma’am , ”
169240	169248	169224	169224	Florence	197	“ Is this Captain Cuttle ’s house ? ”
169249	169252	169254	169255	Mrs MacStinger	320	“ No , ”
169257	169262	169264	169264	Florence	197	“ Not Number Nine ? ”
169268	169277	169279	169280	Mrs MacStinger	320	“ Who said it was n’t Number Nine ? ”
169320	169335	169337	169338	Mrs MacStinger	320	“ What do you want with Captain Cuttle , I should wish to know ? ”
169340	169355	169337	169338	Mrs MacStinger	320	“ Should you ? Then I ’m sorry that you wo n’t be satisfied , ”
169360	169369	169371	169371	Florence	197	“ Hush , Susan ! If you please ! ”
169373	169396	169371	169371	Florence	197	“ Perhaps you can have the goodness to tell us where Captain Cuttle lives , Ma’am as he do n’t live here . ”
169397	169406	169408	169410	the implacable MacStinger	320	“ Who says he do n’t live here ? ”
169412	169492	169408	169410	the implacable MacStinger	320	“ I said it was n’t Cap’en Cuttle ’s house — and it ai n’t his house — and forbid it , that it ever should be his house — for Cap’en Cuttle do n’t know how to keep a house — and do n’t deserve to have a house — it ’s my house — and when I let the upper floor to Cap’en Cuttle , oh I do a thankless thing , and cast pearls before swine ! ”
169548	169552	169544	169544	his	10100	“ Steady below ! ”
169553	169564	169574	169574	her	320	“ Since you want Cap’en Cuttle , there he is ! ”
170010	170022	170024	170024	Florence	197	“ You are amazed to see us , I am sure , ”
170056	170063	170030	170033	The inexpressibly gratified Captain	4223	“ Stand by ! Stand by ! ”
170064	170071	170073	170073	Florence	197	“ But I could n’t rest , ”
170075	170124	170073	170073	Florence	197	“ without coming to ask you what you think about dear Walter — who is my brother now — and whether there is anything to fear , and whether you will not go and console his poor Uncle every day , until we have some intelligence of him ? ”
170157	170167	170169	170169	Florence	197	“ Have you any fears for Walter ’s safety ? ”
170212	170219	170221	170222	Captain Cuttle	250	“ No , Heart’s - delight , ”
170224	170230	170221	170222	Captain Cuttle	250	“ I am not afeard . Wal”r
170244	170255	170221	170222	Captain Cuttle	250	Wal”r is a lad as’ll bring as much success to that “
170265	170267	170269	170270	the Captain	10100	Wal”r , ”
170293	170319	170284	170284	his	10100	“ is what you may call a out’ard and visible sign of an in’ard and spirited grasp , and when found make a note of . ”
170351	170362	170364	170365	the Captain	10100	“ I am not afeard , my Heart’s - delight , ”
170367	170429	170364	170365	the Captain	10100	“ There ’s been most uncommon bad weather in them latitudes , there ’s no denyin ’ , and they have drove and drove and been beat off , may be t’other side the world . But the ship ’s a good ship , and the lad ’s a good lad ; and it ai n’t easy , thank the Lord , ”
170437	170481	170430	170431	the Captain	10100	“ to break up hearts of oak , whether they ’re in brigs or buzzums . Here we have ’em both ways , which is bringing it up with a round turn , and so I ai n’t a bit afeard as yet . ”
170482	170486	170488	170488	Florence	197	“ As yet ? ”
170490	170495	170497	170498	the Captain	10100	“ Not a bit , ”
170505	170518	170497	170498	the Captain	10100	“ and afore I begin to be , my Hearts - delight , Wal”r
170543	170558	170497	170498	the Captain	10100	” And with regard to old Sol Gills , here the Captain became solemn , “
170592	170598	170604	170604	them	4238	” said the Captain parenthetically , “
170645	170657	170658	170659	ere man	4240	“ prenticeship , and of which the name is Bunsby , that “
170676	170683	170688	170688	he	3192	” said Captain Cuttle , vauntingly , “
170699	170700	170688	170688	he	3192	” “
170718	170722	170715	170715	he	3192	” cried Florence . “
170736	170874	170875	170875	You	4246	” Again the Captain clapped his hand to his head , on which the hard glazed hat was not , and looked discomfited . But at this instant a most remarkable phenomenon occurred . The door opening , without any note of preparation , and apparently of itself , the hard glazed hat in question skimmed into the room like a bird , and alighted heavily at the Captain ’s feet . The door then shut as violently as it had opened , and nothing ensued in explanation of the prodigy . Captain Cuttle picked up his hat , and having turned it over with a look of interest and welcome , began to polish it on his sleeve . While doing so , the Captain eyed his visitors intently , and said in a low voice , “
170912	170913	170894	170894	she	4247	” “
170921	170926	170894	170894	she	4247	” asked Susan Nipper . “
170936	170952	170927	170931	The lady of the house	4248	” returned the Captain , in a gruff whisper , and making signals of secrecy . “
170971	170988	170989	170989	she	4247	” said the Captain , eyeing the door , and relieving himself with a long breath , “
170994	170995	170989	170989	she	4247	” “
171007	171019	171000	171000	she	4247	” said Susan , reddening with the energy of the wish . “
171025	171026	171028	171028	you	0	” “
171036	171059	171031	171031	you	0	” rejoined the Captain , shaking his head doubtfully , but regarding the desperate courage of the fair aspirant with obvious admiration . “
171113	171171	171108	171108	she	4247	” said the Captain , with the perspiration breaking out upon his forehead . There was nothing but a whistle emphatic enough for the conclusion of the sentence , so the Captain whistled tremulously . After which he again shook his head , and recurring to his admiration of Miss Nipper ’s devoted bravery , timidly repeated , “
171182	171787	171788	171788	Clara	461	” Susan only replied with a bridling smile , but that was so very full of defiance , that there is no knowing how long Captain Cuttle might have stood entranced in its contemplation , if Florence in her anxiety had not again proposed their immediately resorting to the oracular Bunsby . Thus reminded of his duty , Captain Cuttle put on the glazed hat firmly , took up another knobby stick , with which he had supplied the place of that one given to Walter , and offering his arm to Florence , prepared to cut his way through the enemy . It turned out , however , that Mrs MacStinger had already changed her course , and that she headed , as the Captain had remarked she often did , in quite a new direction . For when they got downstairs , they found that exemplary woman beating the mats on the doorsteps , with Alexander , still upon the paving - stone , dimly looming through a fog of dust ; and so absorbed was Mrs MacStinger in her household occupation , that when Captain Cuttle and his visitors passed , she beat the harder , and neither by word nor gesture showed any consciousness of their vicinity . The Captain was so well pleased with this easy escape — although the effect of the door - mats on him was like a copious administration of snuff , and made him sneeze until the tears ran down his face — that he could hardly believe his good fortune ; but more than once , between the door and the hackney - coach , looked over his shoulder , with an obvious apprehension of Mrs MacStinger ’s giving chase yet . However , they got to the corner of Brig Place without any molestation from that terrible fire - ship ; and the Captain mounting the coach - box — for his gallantry would not allow him to ride inside with the ladies , though besought to do so — piloted the driver on his course for Captain Bunsby ’s vessel , which was called the Cautious Clara , and was lying hard by Ratcliffe . Arrived at the wharf off which this great commander ’s ship was jammed in among some five hundred companions , whose tangled rigging looked like monstrous cobwebs half swept down , Captain Cuttle appeared at the coach - window , and invited Florence and Miss Nipper to accompany him on board ; observing that Bunsby was to the last degree soft - hearted in respect of ladies , and that nothing would so much tend to bring his expansive intellect into a state of harmony as their presentation to the Cautious Clara . Florence readily consented ; and the Captain , taking her little hand in his prodigious palm , led her , with a mixed expression of patronage , paternity , pride , and ceremony , that was pleasant to see , over several very dirty decks , until , coming to the Clara , they found that cautious craft ( which lay outside the tier ) with her gangway removed , and half - a - dozen feet of river interposed between herself and her nearest neighbour . It appeared , from Captain Cuttle ’s explanation , that the great Bunsby , like himself , was cruelly treated by his landlady , and that when her usage of him for the time being was so hard that he could bear it no longer , he set this gulf between them as a last resource . “
171793	171808	171788	171788	Clara	461	” cried the Captain , putting a hand to each side of his mouth . “
171813	171829	171788	171788	Clara	461	” cried a boy , like the Captain ’s echo , tumbling up from below . “
171833	171861	171830	171830	Bunsby	460	” cried the Captain , hailing the boy in a stentorian voice , as if he were half - a - mile off instead of two yards . “
171866	172257	171830	171830	Bunsby	460	” cried the boy , in the same tone . The boy then shoved out a plank to Captain Cuttle , who adjusted it carefully , and led Florence across : returning presently for Miss Nipper . So they stood upon the deck of the Cautious Clara , in whose standing rigging , divers fluttering articles of dress were curing , in company with a few tongues and some mackerel . Immediately there appeared , coming slowly up above the bulk - head of the cabin , another bulk - head — human , and very large — with one stationary eye in the mahogany face , and one revolving one , on the principle of some lighthouses . This head was decorated with shaggy hair , like oakum , which had no governing inclination towards the north , east , west , or south , but inclined to all four quarters of the compass , and to every point upon it . The head was followed by a perfect desert of chin , and by a shirt - collar and neckerchief , and by a dreadnought pilot - coat , and by a pair of dreadnought pilot - trousers , whereof the waistband was so very broad and high , that it became a succedaneum for a waistcoat : being ornamented near the wearer ’s breastbone with some massive wooden buttons , like backgammon men . As the lower portions of these pantaloons became revealed , Bunsby stood confessed ; his hands in their pockets , which were of vast size ; and his gaze directed , not to Captain Cuttle or the ladies , but the mast - head . The profound appearance of this philosopher , who was bulky and strong , and on whose extremely red face an expression of taciturnity sat enthroned , not inconsistent with his character , in which that quality was proudly conspicuous , almost daunted Captain Cuttle , though on familiar terms with him . Whispering to Florence that Bunsby had never in his life expressed surprise , and was considered not to know what it meant , the Captain watched him as he eyed his mast - head , and afterwards swept the horizon ; and when the revolving eye seemed to be coming round in his direction , said : “
172267	172298	172258	172258	Bunsby	460	” A deep , gruff , husky utterance , which seemed to have no connexion with Bunsby , and certainly had not the least effect upon his face , replied , “
172309	172336	172337	172337	Bunsby	460	” At the same time Bunsby ’s right hand and arm , emerging from a pocket , shook the Captain ’s , and went back again . “
172339	172349	172337	172337	Bunsby	460	” said the Captain , striking home at once , “
172385	172441	172370	172372	a young lady	3413	Wal”r ; likewise my t’other friend , Sol Gills , which is a character for you to come within hail of , being a man of science , which is the mother of invention , and knows no law . Bunsby , will you wear , to oblige me , and come along with us ? ”
172488	172494	172496	172497	the Captain	10100	“ Here is a man , ”
172515	172609	172500	172500	himself	10100	“ that has fell down , more than any man alive ; that has had more accidents happen to his own self than the Seamen ’s Hospital to all hands ; that took as many spars and bars and bolts about the outside of his head when he was young , as you ’d want a order for on Chatham - yard to build a pleasure yacht with ; and yet that his opinions in that way , it ’s my belief , for there ai n’t nothing like ’em afloat or ashore . ”
172663	172666	172668	172668	Bunsby	460	“ Shipmet , ”
172686	172693	172668	172668	Bunsby	460	“ what ’ll the ladies drink ? ”
173083	173090	173092	173093	Uncle Sol	250	“ Whether she can have run , ”
173101	173148	173092	173093	Uncle Sol	250	“ but no , that ’s almost impossible or whether she can have been forced by stress of weather,—but that ’s not reasonably likely . Or whether there is any hope she so far changed her course as — but even I can hardly hope that ! ”
173301	173309	173311	173311	Florence	197	“ You have been to see me ? ”
173313	173316	173311	173311	Florence	197	“ Today ? ”
173317	173325	173327	173328	Uncle Sol	250	“ Yes , my dear young lady , ”
173342	173366	173368	173368	he	1205	“ I wished to see you with my own eyes , and to hear you with my own ears , once more before — ”
173371	173378	173380	173380	Florence	197	“ Before when ? Before what ? ”
173389	173397	173399	173400	old Sol	250	“ Did I say ‘ before ? ’ ”
173402	173421	173399	173400	old Sol	250	“ If I did , I must have meant before we should have news of my dear boy . ”
173422	173428	173430	173430	Florence	197	“ You are not well , ”
173434	173449	173430	173430	Florence	197	“ You have been so very anxious I am sure you are not well . ”
173450	173456	173458	173460	the old man	1205	“ I am as well , ”
173476	173524	173458	173460	the old man	1205	“ as well and firm as any man at my time of life can hope to be . See ! It ’s steady . Is its master not as capable of resolution and fortitude as many a younger man ? I think so . We shall see . ”
173730	173737	173722	173722	he	4265	“ My name ’s Jack Bunsby ! ”
173738	173744	173746	173749	the delighted Captain Cuttle	250	“ He was christened John , ”
173751	173755	173746	173749	the delighted Captain Cuttle	250	“ Hear him ! ”
173756	173762	173764	173765	the voice	4295	“ And what I says , ”
173771	173776	173764	173765	the voice	4295	“ I stands to . ”
173796	173813	173781	173781	Florence	197	“ Now he ’s coming out . This is what I meant when I brought him . ”
173814	173817	173819	173820	the voice	4295	“ Whereby , ”

173871	173976	173863	173863	It	4295	“ Do I believe that this here Son and Heir ’s gone down , my lads ? Mayhap . Do I say so ? Which ? If a skipper stands out by Sen ’ George ’s Channel , making for the Downs , what ’s right ahead of him ? The Goodwins . He is n’t forced to run upon the Goodwins , but he may . The bearings of this observation lays in the application on it . That ai n’t no part of my duty . Awast then , keep a bright look - out for’ard , and good luck to you ! ”

175425	175478	175411	175412	Sir Barnet	378	“ Now , my dear Sir , is there anybody you would like to know ? Who is there you would wish to meet ? Do you take any interest in writing people , or in painting or sculpturing people , or in acting people , or in anything of that sort ? ”

177262	177275	177277	177278	the child	716	“ Is he lame , or blind , or ill , aunt ? ”

177328	177375	177319	177320	the lady	9737	“ I will tell you the whole truth about Florence as I have heard it , and believe it to be . Tell no one else , my dear , because it may be little known here , and your doing so would give her pain . ”
177376	177381	177383	177384	the child	716	“ I never will ! ”
177386	177393	177395	177396	the lady	9737	“ I know you never will , ”
177398	177481	177395	177396	the lady	9737	“ I can trust you as myself . I fear then , Kate , that Florence ’s father cares little for her , very seldom sees her , never was kind to her in her life , and now quite shuns her and avoids her . She would love him dearly if he would suffer her , but he will not — though for no fault of hers ; and she is greatly to be loved and pitied by all gentle hearts . ”
177515	177524	177526	177527	the child	716	“ Poor Florence ! Dear , good Florence ! ”
177529	177542	177544	177545	the lady	9737	“ Do you know why I have told you this , Kate ? ”
177547	177574	177544	177545	the lady	9737	“ That I may be very kind to her , and take great care to try to please her . Is that the reason , aunt ? ”
177575	177578	177580	177581	the lady	9737	“ Partly , ”
177583	177632	177580	177581	the lady	9737	“ but not all . Though we see her so cheerful ; with a pleasant smile for everyone ; ready to oblige us all , and bearing her part in every amusement here : she can hardly be quite happy , do you think she can , Kate ? ”
177633	177639	177641	177643	the little girl	800	“ I am afraid not , ”
177645	177651	177653	177654	the lady	9737	“ And you can understand , ”
177656	177690	177653	177654	the lady	9737	“ why her observation of children who have parents who are fond of them , and proud of them — like many here , just now — should make her sorrowful in secret ? ”
177691	177697	177699	177700	the child	716	“ Yes , dear aunt , ”
177702	177712	177699	177700	the child	716	“ I understand that very well . Poor Florence ! ”
177738	177742	177744	177745	the lady	9737	“ My Kate , ”
177772	177800	177744	177745	the lady	9737	“ of all the youthful people here , you are her natural and harmless friend ; you have not the innocent means , that happier children have — ”
177801	177809	177811	177812	the child	716	“ There are none happier , aunt ! ”
177821	177886	177811	177812	the child	716	“ — As other children have , dear Kate , of reminding her of her misfortune . Therefore I would have you , when you try to be her little friend , try all the more for that , and feel that the bereavement you sustained — thank Heaven ! before you knew its weight — gives you claim and hold upon poor Florence . ”
177887	177906	177908	177909	the child	716	“ But I am not without a parent ’s love , aunt , and I never have been , ”
177911	177915	177908	177909	the child	716	“ with you . ”
177916	177925	177927	177928	the lady	9737	“ However that may be , my dear , ”
177930	177967	177927	177928	the lady	9737	“ your misfortune is a lighter one than Florence ’s ; for not an orphan in the wide world can be so deserted as the child who is an outcast from a living parent ’s love . ”
178737	178741	178743	178743	Florence	197	“ Good morning , ”
178748	178755	178743	178743	Florence	197	“ you are at work early . ”
178756	178777	178743	178743	Florence	197	“ I ’d be glad to be often at work earlier , Miss , if I had work to do . ”
178778	178786	178788	178788	Florence	197	“ Is it so hard to get ? ”
178790	178796	178798	178799	the man	9864	“ I find it so , ”
178830	178836	178837	178837	He	9864	“ Is that your daughter ? ”
178859	178862	178839	178839	his	9864	“ Yes , ”
178887	178896	178898	178898	Florence	197	“ Is she in want of employment also ? ”
178906	178911	178912	178912	he	9864	“ No , Miss , ”
178915	178921	178912	178912	he	9864	“ I work for both , ”
178922	178931	178933	178933	Florence	197	“ Are there only you two , then ? ”
178935	178940	178942	178943	the man	9864	“ Only us two , ”
178945	178957	178959	178959	he	9864	“ Her mother has been dead these ten year . Martha ! ”
178971	178984	178985	178986	The girl	4472	“ wo n’t you say a word to the pretty young lady ? ”
179044	179058	179060	179061	the man	9864	“ I ’m afraid she ’s worse this morning , my poor girl ! ”
179087	179094	179096	179096	Florence	197	“ She is ill , then ! ”
179105	179121	179122	179122	he	9864	“ I do n’t believe my Martha ’s had five short days ’ good health , ”
179130	179137	179122	179122	he	9864	“ in as many long years . ”
179138	179148	179150	179151	a neighbour	4470	“ Ay ! and more than that , John , ”
179164	179175	179177	179178	the other	10537	“ More than that , you say , do you ? ”
179194	179206	179177	179178	the other	10537	“ Very like . It seems a long , long time . ”
179207	179214	179216	179217	the neighbour	4492	“ And the more the time , ”
179219	179246	179216	179217	the neighbour	4492	“ the more you ’ve favoured and humoured her , John , till she ’s got to be a burden to herself , and everybody else . ”

179354	179404	179405	179406	The father	849	“ In reason , John . But you ! You rob yourself to give to her . You bind yourself hand and foot on her account . You make your life miserable along of her . And what does she care ! You do n’t believe she knows it ? ”
179439	179446	179448	179449	the neighbour	4492	“ Only for that , Miss , ”
179467	179482	179448	179449	the neighbour	4492	“ only to get that , he never lets her out of his sight ! ”
179483	179497	179499	179500	the other	10537	“ Because the day’ll come , and has been coming a long while , ”
179508	179544	179499	179500	the other	10537	“ when to get half as much from that unfort’nate child of mine — to get the trembling of a finger , or the waving of a hair — would be to raise the dead . ”
179761	179794	179751	179751	he	849	“ Dear Florence , live for me , and we will love each other as we might have done , and be as happy as we might have been these many years ! ”

182148	182159	182161	182161	Rob	424	“ I have n’t been and committed nothing , Captain ! ”
182163	182170	182172	182173	the Captain	10100	“ Keep her free , then , ”
182177	182182	182172	182173	the Captain	10100	“ and ride easy . ”
182593	182600	182602	182602	Rob	424	“ And I think , Captain , ”
182609	182641	182602	182602	Rob	424	“ that when Mr Gills was going in and out so often , these last few days , he was taking little things away , piecemeal , not to attract attention . ”
182642	182645	182647	182648	the Captain	10100	“ Ay ! ”
182652	182659	182647	182648	the Captain	10100	“ Why so , my lad ? ”
182660	182663	182665	182665	Rob	424	“ Why , ”
182670	182694	182665	182665	Rob	424	“ I do n’t see his shaving tackle . Nor his brushes , Captain . Nor no shirts . Nor yet his shoes . ”
182769	182776	182778	182779	the Captain—“not	13186	“ And what should you say , ”
182779	182792	182778	182779	the Captain—“not	13186	Captain—“not committing yourself — about his time of sheering off ? Hey ? ”
182793	182801	182778	182779	the Captain—“not	13186	“ Why , I think , Captain , ”
182805	182819	182778	182779	the Captain—“not	13186	“ that he must have gone pretty soon after I began to snore . ”
182820	182826	182828	182829	the Captain	10100	“ What o’clock was that ? ”
182841	182849	182851	182851	Rob	424	“ How can I tell , Captain ! ”
182853	182908	182851	182851	Rob	424	“ I only know that I ’m a heavy sleeper at first , and a light one towards morning ; and if Mr Gills had come through the shop near daybreak , though ever so much on tiptoe , I ’m pretty sure I should have heard him shut the door at all events . ”
183491	183495	183496	183497	Captain Cuttle	392	poison—“to make sure , ”
183500	183506	183496	183497	Captain Cuttle	392	“ that it wam’t him . ”
183566	183575	183560	183560	he	392	“ a home in the old place for Walter ”
183660	183670	183672	183673	the Captain	10100	“ Now , look ye here , my lad , ”
183685	183733	183672	183673	the Captain	10100	“ to - morrow , I sha n’t be found in this here roadstead till night — not till arter midnight p’rhaps . But you keep watch till you hear me knock , and the moment you do , turn - to , and open the door . ”
183734	183740	183742	183742	Rob	424	“ Very good , Captain , ”
183744	183756	183758	183759	the Captain	10100	“ You ’ll continue to be rated on these here books , ”
183762	183814	183758	183759	the Captain	10100	“ and I do n’t say but what you may get promotion , if you and me should pull together with a will . But the moment you hear me knock to - morrow night , whatever time it is , turn - to and show yourself smart with the door . ”
183815	183826	183828	183828	Rob	424	“ I ’ll be sure to do it , Captain , ”
183830	183835	183837	183838	the Captain	10100	“ Because you understand , ”
183851	183886	183887	183887	Rob	424	“ there may be , for anything I can say , a chase ; and I might be took while I was waiting , if you did n’t show yourself smart with the door . ”
184030	184042	184044	184045	his landlady	13031	“ A nice small kidney - pudding now , Cap’en Cuttle , ”
184047	184060	184044	184045	his landlady	13031	“ or a sheep ’s heart . Do n’t mind my trouble . ”
184061	184067	184069	184070	the Captain	10100	“ No thank’ee , Ma’am , ”
184072	184078	184080	184081	Mrs MacStinger	320	“ Have a roast fowl , ”
184083	184106	184080	184081	Mrs MacStinger	320	“ with a bit of weal stuffing and some egg sauce . Come , Cap’en Cuttle ! Give yourself a little treat ! ”
184107	184113	184115	184116	the Captain	10100	“ No thank’ee , Ma’am , ”
184120	184136	184138	184139	Mrs MacStinger	320	“ I ’m sure you ’re out of sorts , and want to be stimulated , ”
184141	184158	184138	184139	Mrs MacStinger	320	“ Why not have , for once in a way , a bottle of sherry wine ? ”
184159	184164	184166	184167	the Captain	10100	“ Well , Ma’am , ”
184169	184199	184201	184202	the Captain	10100	“ if you ’d be so good as take a glass or two , I think I would try that . Would you do me the favour , Ma’am , ”
184211	184220	184201	184202	the Captain	10100	“ to accept a quarter ’s rent ahead ? ”
184221	184229	184231	184232	Mrs MacStinger	320	“ And why so , Cap’en Cuttle ? ”
184247	184253	184254	184254	he	10100	“ If you would Ma’am , ”
184259	184289	184254	184254	he	10100	“ it would oblige me . I ca n’t keep my money very well . It pays itself out . I should take it kind if you ’d comply . ”
184290	184296	184300	184300	MacStinger	320	“ Well , Cap’en Cuttle , ”
184306	184335	184300	184300	MacStinger	320	“ you can do as you please . It ’s not for me , with my family , to refuse , no more than it is to ask . ”
184336	184343	184345	184346	the Captain	10100	“ And would you , Ma’am , ”
184368	184420	184355	184355	he	10100	“ be so good as offer eighteen - pence a - piece to the little family all round ? If you could make it convenient , Ma’am , to pass the word presently for them children to come for’ard , in a body , I should be glad to see ’em . ”
184821	184824	184826	184827	the Captain	10100	“ Whew ! ”
184833	184839	184826	184827	the Captain	10100	“ It ’s a breather ! ”
184840	184850	184852	184854	the gaping Rob	424	“ Nothing the matter , is there , Captain ? ”
184856	184861	184863	184864	Captain Cuttle	392	“ No , no ! ”
184880	184935	184863	184864	Captain Cuttle	392	“ But mind ye , my lad ; if any lady , except either of them two as you see t’other day , ever comes and asks for Cap’en Cuttle , be sure to report no person of that name known , nor never heard of here ; observe them orders , will you ? ”
184936	184944	184946	184946	Rob	424	“ I ’ll take care , Captain , ”
184948	184957	184959	184960	the Captain	10100	“ You might say — if you liked , ”
184962	185003	184959	184960	the Captain	10100	“ that you ’d read in the paper that a Cap’en of that name was gone to Australia , emigrating , along with a whole ship ’s complement of people as had all swore never to come back no more . ”
185556	185561	185554	185554	Sir	735	” said the Major . “
185587	185588	185589	185589	I	0	” “
185596	185601	185594	185594	Carker	274	” explained Mr Dombey , “
185622	185683	185620	185620	Carker	274	” Mr Carker the Manager , hat in hand , just arrived at Leamington , and just introduced to the Major , showed the Major his whole double range of teeth , and trusted he might take the liberty of thanking him with all his heart for having effected so great an Improvement in Mr Dombey ’s looks and spirits . “
185689	185697	185687	185687	Sir	735	” said the Major , in reply , “
185725	185749	185723	185723	Sir	735	” said the Major , lowering his voice , but not lowering it so much as to render it inaudible to that gentleman , “
185776	185803	185772	185772	his	190	” Mr Carker snapped at the expression . In his moral nature . Exactly . The very words he had been on the point of suggesting . “
185812	185817	185810	185810	Sir	735	” added the Major , “
185862	185898	185853	185854	Old J.	477	” Mr Carker ’s excessively friendly inclinations towards the Major , and Mr Carker ’s admiration of his roughness , toughness , and plainness , gleamed out of every tooth in Mr Carker ’s head . “
185904	185909	185902	185902	Sir	735	” said the Major , “
185925	185926	185902	185902	Sir	735	” “
185933	185938	185939	185939	Dombey	190	” observed Mr Dombey . “
185941	185948	185939	185939	Dombey	190	” said the Major , defiantly , “
186005	186034	186002	186003	Mr Carker	274	” With that , the Major , greatly swollen as to his face , withdrew ; but immediately putting in his head at the door again , said : “
186049	186077	186043	186043	you	190	” Mr Dombey in some embarrassment , and not without a glance at the courteous keeper of his business confidence , entrusted the Major with his compliments . “
186084	186089	186079	186080	the Lord	2214	” said the Major , “
186108	186109	186100	186101	old Joe	290	” “
186119	186124	186117	186117	Major	298	” returned Mr Dombey . “
186129	186143	186127	186127	Sir	735	” said the Major , shaking his shoulders and his great cheeks jocularly : “
186151	186152	186154	186154	you	735	” “
186161	186166	186159	186159	Major	10950	” observed Mr Dombey . “
186183	186195	186176	186176	Sir	735	” said the Major , staring round the door at Carker . “
186200	186232	186198	186198	Bagstock	298	” But stopping in the midst of a chuckle , and drawing himself up to his full height , the Major solemnly exclaimed , as he struck himself on the chest , “
186244	186248	186242	186242	you	190	” and withdrew . “
186259	186269	186249	186249	You	190	” said Carker , following him with his teeth . “
186274	186279	186249	186249	You	190	” said Mr Dombey . “
186288	186292	186280	186280	He	2410	” pursued Carker . “
186313	186317	186310	186310	you	190	” smiling horribly , “
186329	186359	186318	186318	I	0	” Mr Dombey acknowledged this display of interest on the part of his second in command , by twirling his watch - chain , and slightly moving his head . “
186366	186370	186318	186318	I	0	” said Carker . “
186414	186415	186416	186416	I	0	” “
186452	186453	186456	186456	I	0	” “
186458	186469	186456	186456	I	0	” returned the other , with ready self - disparagement . “
186493	186527	186484	186484	I	0	” Mr Dombey put his hand to his neckcloth , settled his chin in it , coughed , and stood looking at his faithful friend and servant for a few moments in silence . “
186536	186557	186528	186528	I	0	” said Mr Dombey at length : making as if he swallowed something a little too large for his throat : “
186574	186575	186570	186572	Highly agreeable people	4732	” “
186583	186589	186580	186580	I	0	” insinuated the smooth Manager . “
186605	186610	186603	186603	ladies	2860	” replied Mr Dombey . “
186614	186618	186619	186619	They	4731	” smiled Carker . “
186641	186642	186643	186643	Sisters	478	” “
186647	186651	186652	186652	Mother	12864	” quoth Carker . “
186656	186744	186652	186652	Mother	12864	” replied Mr Dombey . As Mr Dombey dropped his eyes , and adjusted his neckcloth again , the smiling face of Mr Carker the Manager became in a moment , and without any stage of transition , transformed into a most intent and frowning face , scanning his closely , and with an ugly sneer . As Mr Dombey raised his eyes , it changed back , no less quickly , to its old expression , and showed him every gum of which it stood possessed . “
186750	186754	186745	186745	You	4738	” said Carker , “
186773	186787	186770	186771	Miss Dombey	287	” There was a sudden rush of blood to Mr Dombey ’s face . “
186797	186801	186788	186788	I	0	” said Carker , “
186834	186863	186830	186832	her dear love	4741	” Wolf ’s face that it was then , with even the hot tongue revealing itself through the stretched mouth , as the eyes encountered Mr Dombey ’s ! “
186870	186892	186830	186832	her dear love	4741	” inquired the latter gentleman , after a silence , during which Mr Carker had produced some memoranda and other papers . “
186898	186902	186830	186832	her dear love	4741	” returned Carker . “
186953	186954	186955	186955	Carker	274	” “
186957	186968	186955	186955	Carker	274	” said Mr Dombey , taking a chair near him , “
186984	186985	186977	186977	Gay	293	” “
186989	186994	186977	186977	Gay	293	” interposed the Manager . “
187000	187010	186997	186997	I	0	” said Mr Dombey , without heeding the interruption , “
187029	187048	187050	187050	Carker	274	“ It is a pity you did n’t say so , in good time , is it not ? ”
187054	187094	187050	187050	Carker	274	“ However , I think it ’s all for the best . I really , think it ’s all for the best . Did I mention that there was something like a little confidence between Miss Dombey and myself ? ”
187095	187098	187100	187101	Mr Dombey	190	“ No , ”
187105	187111	187100	187101	Mr Dombey	190	“ I have no doubt , ”
187121	187208	187113	187114	Mr Carker	274	“ that wherever Gay is , he is much better where he is , than at home here . If I were , or could be , in your place , I should be satisfied of that . I am quite satisfied of it myself . Miss Dombey is confiding and young — perhaps hardly proud enough , for your daughter — if she have a fault . Not that that is much though , I am sure . Will you check these balances with me ? ”
187564	187574	187576	187577	Mrs Skewton	430	“ What insupportable creature is this , coming in ? ”
187579	187593	187576	187577	Mrs Skewton	430	“ I can not hear it . Go away , whoever you are ! ”
187594	187607	187609	187610	the Major	1679	“ You have not the heart to banish J. B. , Ma’am ! ”
187624	187641	187643	187643	Cleopatra	432	“ Oh it ’s you , is it ? On second thoughts , you may enter , ”
187663	187667	187669	187669	Cleopatra	432	“ Sit down , ”
187676	187711	187669	187669	Cleopatra	432	“ a long way off . Do n’t come too near me , for I am frightfully faint and sensitive this morning , and you smell of the Sun . You are absolutely tropical . ”
187712	187718	187720	187721	the Major	1679	“ By George , Ma’am , ”
187723	187809	187811	187812	the Major	1679	“ the time has been when Joseph Bagstock has been grilled and blistered by the Sun ; then time was , when he was forced , Ma’am , into such full blow , by high hothouse heat in the West Indies , that he was known as the Flower . A man never heard of Bagstock , Ma’am , in those days ; he heard of the Flower — the Flower of Ours . The Flower may have faded , more or less , Ma’am , ”
187829	187844	187811	187812	the Major	1679	“ but it is a tough plant yet , and constant as the evergreen . ”
187892	187898	187900	187900	Cleopatra	432	“ Where is Mrs Granger ? ”
187914	187918	187920	187921	Mrs Skewton	430	“ Very well , ”
187923	187936	187920	187921	Mrs Skewton	430	“ Go away , and shut the door . I am engaged . ”
187963	187968	187970	187971	the Major	1679	“ Dombey , Ma’am , ”
187981	188012	188014	188015	the Major	1679	“ is as well as a man in his condition can be . His condition is a desperate one , Ma’am . He is touched , is Dombey ! Touched ! ”
188017	188025	188014	188015	the Major	1679	“ He is bayonetted through the body . ”
188048	188138	188140	188141	Mrs Skewton	430	“ Major Bagstock , although I know but little of the world,—nor can I really regret my experience , for I fear it is a false place , full of withering conventionalities : where Nature is but little regarded , and where the music of the heart , and the gushing of the soul , and all that sort of thing , which is so truly poetical , is seldom heard,—I can not misunderstand your meaning . There is an allusion to Edith — to my extremely dear child , ”
188153	188167	188140	188141	Mrs Skewton	430	“ in your words , to which the tenderest of chords vibrates excessively . ”
188168	188173	188175	188176	the Major	1679	“ Bluntness , Ma’am , ”
188178	188197	188175	188176	the Major	1679	“ has ever been the characteristic of the Bagstock breed . You are right . Joe admits it . ”
188198	188203	188205	188205	Cleopatra	432	“ And that allusion , ”
188207	188242	188205	188205	Cleopatra	432	“ would involve one of the most — if not positively the most — touching , and thrilling , and sacred emotions of which our sadly - fallen nature is susceptible , I conceive . ”
188268	188303	188305	188306	Mrs Skewton	430	“ I feel that I am weak . I feel that I am wanting in that energy , which should sustain a Mama : not to say a parent : on such a subject , ”
188321	188364	188305	188306	Mrs Skewton	430	“ but I can hardly approach a topic so excessively momentous to my dearest Edith without a feeling of faintness . Nevertheless , bad man , as you have boldly remarked upon it , and as it has occasioned me great anguish : ”
188375	188384	188365	188366	Mrs Skewton	430	“ I will not shrink from my duty . ”
188443	188447	188449	188450	Mrs Skewton	430	“ Mr Dombey , ”
188458	188560	188453	188453	she	430	“ was obliging enough , now many weeks ago , to do us the honour of visiting us here ; in company , my dear Major , with yourself . I acknowledge — let me be open — that it is my failing to be the creature of impulse , and to wear my heart as it were , outside . I know my failing full well . My enemy can not know it better . But I am not penitent ; I would rather not be frozen by the heartless world , and am content to bear this imputation justly . ”
188586	188647	188561	188562	Mrs Skewton	430	“ It gave me ( my dearest Edith too , I am sure ) infinite pleasure to receive Mr Dombey . As a friend of yours , my dear Major , we were naturally disposed to be prepossessed in his favour ; and I fancied that I observed an amount of Heart in Mr Dombey , that was excessively refreshing . ”
188648	188660	188662	188663	the Major	1679	“ There is devilish little heart in Dombey now , Ma’am , ”
188665	188669	188671	188672	Mrs Skewton	430	“ Wretched man ! ”
188679	188684	188671	188672	Mrs Skewton	430	“ pray be silent . ”
188685	188693	188695	188696	the Major	1679	“ J. B. is dumb , Ma’am , ”
188698	188702	188695	188696	the Major	1679	“ Mr Dombey , ”
188714	188777	188695	188696	the Major	1679	“ accordingly repeated his visit ; and possibly finding some attraction in the simplicity and primitiveness of our tastes — for there is always a charm in nature — it is so very sweet — became one of our little circle every evening . Little did I think of the awful responsibility into which I plunged when I encouraged Mr Dombey — to ”
188779	188788	188790	188791	Major Bagstock	298	“ To beat up these quarters , Ma’am , ”
188793	188797	188799	188800	Mrs Skewton	430	“ Coarse person ! ”
188802	188813	188799	188800	Mrs Skewton	430	“ you anticipate my meaning , though in odious language . ”
188859	188866	188867	188867	she	430	“ The agony I have endured , ”
188871	188943	188867	188867	she	430	“ as the truth has by degrees dawned upon me , has been too exceedingly terrific to dilate upon . My whole existence is bound up in my sweetest Edith ; and to see her change from day to day — my beautiful pet , who has positively garnered up her heart since the death of that most delightful creature , Granger — is the most affecting thing in the world . ”
188978	188981	188983	188984	Mrs Skewton	430	“ Edith , ”
188986	189008	188983	188984	Mrs Skewton	430	“ who is the perfect pearl of my life , is said to resemble me . I believe we are alike . ”
189009	189028	189030	189031	the Major	1679	“ There is one man in the world who never will admit that anyone resembles you , Ma’am , ”
189033	189044	189030	189031	the Major	1679	“ and that man ’s name is Old Joe Bagstock . ”
189067	189081	189049	189049	she	432	“ If my charming girl inherits any advantages from me , wicked one ! ”
189090	189171	189086	189088	the wicked one	4786	“ she inherits also my foolish nature . She has great force of character — mine has been said to be immense , though I do n’t believe it — but once moved , she is susceptible and sensitive to the last extent . What are my feelings when I see her pining ! They destroy me . The Major advancing his double chin , and pursing up his blue lips into a soothing expression , affected the profoundest sympathy . “
189175	189180	189247	189247	Cleopatra	432	” said Mrs Skewton , “
189215	189216	189204	189204	We	4787	” “
189218	189222	189224	189225	the Major	1679	B.“s own sentiment , ”
189227	189236	189224	189225	the Major	1679	“ expressed by J. B. fifty thousand times ! ”
189237	189245	189247	189247	Cleopatra	432	“ Do not interrupt , rude man ! ”
189249	189307	189247	189247	Cleopatra	432	“ What are my feelings , then , when I find that there is one subject avoided by us ! That there is a what’s - his - name — a gulf — opened between us . That my own artless Edith is changed to me ! They are of the most poignant description , of course . ”
189323	189336	189338	189339	Mrs Skewton	430	“ From day to day I see this , my dear Major , ”
189341	189458	189338	189339	Mrs Skewton	430	“ From day to day I feel this . From hour to hour I reproach myself for that excess of faith and trustfulness which has led to such distressing consequences ; and almost from minute to minute , I hope that Mr Dombey may explain himself , and relieve the torture I undergo , which is extremely wearing . But nothing happens , my dear Major ; I am the slave of remorse — take care of the coffee - cup : you are so very awkward — my darling Edith is an altered being ; and I really do n’t see what is to be done , or what good creature I can advise with . ”
189508	189515	189495	189495	his	298	“ Advise with Joe , Ma’am . ”
189516	189523	189525	189525	Cleopatra	432	“ Then , you aggravating monster , ”
189549	189575	189543	189543	she	432	“ why do n’t you talk to me ? you know what I mean . Why do n’t you tell me something to the purpose ? ”
189595	189611	189613	189613	Cleopatra	432	“ Is there as much Heart in Mr Dombey as I gave him credit for ? ”
189616	189657	189613	189613	Cleopatra	432	“ Do you think he is in earnest , my dear Major ? Would you recommend his being spoken to , or his being left alone ? Now tell me , like a dear man , what would you advise . ”
189658	189669	189671	189672	the Major	1679	“ Shall we marry him to Edith Granger , Ma’am ? ”
189676	189680	189682	189682	Cleopatra	432	“ Mysterious creature ! ”
189695	189702	189682	189682	Cleopatra	432	“ How can we marry him ? ”
189703	189717	189719	189720	the Major	1679	“ Shall we marry him to Edith Granger , Ma’am , I say ? ”
189796	189801	189803	189804	the Major	1679	“ Dombey , Ma’am , ”
189806	189812	189803	189804	the Major	1679	“ is a great catch . ”
189813	189819	189821	189821	Cleopatra	432	“ Oh , mercenary wretch ! ”
189828	189833	189821	189821	Cleopatra	432	“ I am shocked . ”
189834	189840	189842	189843	the Major	1679	“ And Dombey , Ma’am , ”
189855	189908	189842	189843	the Major	1679	“ is in earnest . Joseph says it ; Bagstock knows it ; J. B. keeps him to the mark . Leave Dombey to himself , Ma’am . Dombey is safe , Ma’am . Do as you have done ; do no more ; and trust to J. B. for the end . ”
189909	189919	189921	189921	Cleopatra	432	“ You really think so , my dear Major ? ”
189941	189948	189950	189951	the Major	1679	“ Sure of it , Ma’am , ”
189953	189992	189994	189995	the Major	1679	“ Cleopatra the peerless , and her Antony Bagstock , will often speak of this , triumphantly , when sharing the elegance and wealth of Edith Dombey ’s establishment . Dombey ’s right - hand man , Ma’am , ”
190007	190011	189994	189995	the Major	1679	“ has arrived . ”
190012	190016	190018	190018	Cleopatra	432	“ This morning ? ”
190020	190026	190028	190029	the Major	1679	“ This morning , Ma’am , ”
190031	190049	190028	190029	the Major	1679	“ And Dombey ’s anxiety for his arrival , Ma’am , is to be referred — take J. B.“s
190058	190079	189994	189995	the Major	1679	sly”—the Major tapped his nose , and screwed up one of his eyes tight : which did not enhance his native beauty—“to
190093	190110	190112	190113	the Major	1679	” without Dombey ’s telling and consulting him . For Dombey is as proud , Ma’am , ”
190115	190119	190112	190113	the Major	1679	“ as Lucifer . ”
190120	190125	190127	190128	Mrs Skewton	430	“ A charming quality , ”
190130	190137	190127	190128	Mrs Skewton	430	“ reminding one of dearest Edith . ”
190138	190143	190145	190146	the Major	1679	“ Well , Ma’am , ”
190148	190222	190224	190225	the Major	1679	“ I have thrown out hints already , and the right - hand man understands ’em ; and I ’ll throw out more , before the day is done . Dombey projected this morning a ride to Warwick Castle , and to Kenilworth , to - morrow , to be preceded by a breakfast with us . I undertook the delivery of this invitation . Will you honour us so far , Ma’am ? ”
190301	190304	190306	190306	Cleopatra	432	“ Hush ! ”
190310	190313	190306	190306	Cleopatra	432	“ Edith ! ”
190467	190472	190474	190475	Mrs Skewton	430	“ My dearest Edith , ”
190477	190496	190474	190475	Mrs Skewton	430	“ where on earth have you been ? I have wanted you , my love , most sadly . ”
190497	190509	190510	190510	she	481	“ You said you were engaged , and I stayed away , ”
190518	190528	190530	190531	the Major	1679	“ It was cruel to Old Joe , Ma’am , ”
190536	190545	190546	190546	she	481	“ It was very cruel , I know , ”
190574	190582	190584	190585	her mother	718	“ Major Bagstock , my darling Edith , ”
190587	190605	190584	190585	her mother	718	“ who is generally the most useless and disagreeable creature in the world : as you know — ”
190606	190615	190617	190617	Edith	481	“ It is surely not worthwhile , Mama , ”
190622	190640	190617	190617	Edith	481	“ to observe these forms of speech . We are quite alone . We know each other . ”
190690	190695	190696	190696	she	718	“ My darling girl , ”
190700	190705	190707	190707	Edith	481	“ Not woman yet ? ”
190713	190769	190707	190707	Edith	481	“ How very odd you are today , my dear ! Pray let me say , my love , that Major Bagstock has brought the kindest of notes from Mr Dombey , proposing that we should breakfast with him to - morrow , and ride to Warwick and Kenilworth . Will you go , Edith ? ”
190770	190775	190776	190776	she	481	“ Will I go ! ”
190794	190808	190776	190776	she	481	“ I knew you would , my own , observed the latter carelessly . “
190831	190832	190829	190829	Edith	481	” “
190844	190849	190836	190836	I	0	” was her answer . “
190859	190864	190857	190857	myself	0	” said Mrs Skewton , “
190879	190937	190866	190866	I	0	” As Edith made no movement , and no answer , Mrs Skewton begged the Major to wheel her little table nearer , and to set open the desk it contained , and to take out pen and paper for her ; all which congenial offices of gallantry the Major discharged , with much submission and devotion . “
190946	190961	190941	190941	Edith	481	” said Mrs Skewton , pausing , pen in hand , at the postscript . “
190968	191122	190963	190963	you	481	” she answered , without turning her head , and with supreme indifference . Mrs Skewton wrote what she would , without seeking for any more explicit directions , and handed her letter to the Major , who receiving it as a precious charge , made a show of laying it near his heart , but was fain to put it in the pocket of his pantaloons on account of the insecurity of his waistcoat . The Major then took a very polished and chivalrous farewell of both ladies , which the elder one acknowledged in her usual manner , while the younger , sitting with her face addressed to the window , bent her head so slightly that it would have been a greater compliment to the Major to have made no sign at all , and to have left him to infer that he had not been heard or thought of . “
191131	191173	190963	190963	you	481	” mused the Major on his way back ; on which expedition — the afternoon being sunny and hot — he ordered the Native and the light baggage to the front , and walked in the shadow of that expatriated prince : “
191248	191253	191246	191246	Sir	735	” panted the Major , “
191273	191572	191268	191268	Bagstock	290	” The Major , by saying these latter words aloud , in the vigour of his thoughts , caused the unhappy Native to stop , and turn round , in the belief that he was personally addressed . Exasperated to the last degree by this act of insubordination , the Major ( though he was swelling with enjoyment of his own humour ) , at the moment of its occurrence instantly thrust his cane among the Native ’s ribs , and continued to stir him up , at short intervals , all the way to the hotel . Nor was the Major less exasperated as he dressed for dinner , during which operation the dark servant underwent the pelting of a shower of miscellaneous objects , varying in size from a boot to a hairbrush , and including everything that came within his master ’s reach . For the Major plumed himself on having the Native in a perfect state of drill , and visited the least departure from strict discipline with this kind of fatigue duty . Add to this , that he maintained the Native about his person as a counter - irritant against the gout , and all other vexations , mental as well as bodily ; and the Native would appear to have earned his pay — which was not large . At length , the Major having disposed of all the missiles that were convenient to his hand , and having called the Native so many new names as must have given him great occasion to marvel at the resources of the English language , submitted to have his cravat put on ; and being dressed , and finding himself in a brisk flow of spirits after this exercise , went downstairs to enliven “
191574	191613	191616	191616	Sir	735	” and his right - hand man . Dombey was not yet in the room , but the right - hand man was there , and his dental treasures were , as usual , ready for the Major . “
191618	191623	191616	191616	Sir	735	” said the Major . “
191645	191646	191640	191640	you	735	” “
191657	191661	191640	191640	you	735	” returned Carker . “
191669	191670	191640	191640	you	735	” “
191675	191680	191640	191640	you	735	” said the Major . “
191692	191696	191640	191640	you	735	” replied Carker . “
191725	191739	191699	191699	you	735	” he said , breaking off , and speaking in a charming tone of frankness—“but
191750	191751	191747	191748	Major Bagstock	298	” “
191759	191764	191765	191765	You	735	” returned the Major . “
191769	191770	191765	191765	You	735	” “
191777	191781	191772	191772	you	735	” pursued Carker , “
191800	191801	191798	191798	him	11024	” “
191807	191812	191803	191803	Dombey	481	” cried the Major . “
191826	191848	191823	191824	J. B.	324	” He was puffy enough to see , and blue enough ; and Mr Carker intimated the he had that pleasure . “
191868	191885	191852	191853	a man	868	” returned Major Bagstock . Mr Carker smiled , and said he was sure of it . “
191892	191896	191890	191890	Major	298	” he proceeded : “
191920	191921	191890	191890	Major	298	” “
191924	191930	191934	191934	him	3513	” observed the delighted Major . “
191947	191951	191931	191931	I	0	” said Carker . “
191957	191962	191955	191955	Sir	735	” cried the Major , “
191971	191972	191965	191969	a lady in the case	4843	” “
191983	191987	191965	191969	a lady in the case	4843	” returned Carker ; “
192008	192031	192005	192005	you	735	” — The Major gave the horse ’s cough , and shook his head and shoulders , as much as to say , “
192044	192424	192425	192425	Dombey	190	” He then seized Mr Carker by the button - hole , and with starting eyes whispered in his ear , that she was a woman of extraordinary charms , Sir . That she was a young widow , Sir . That she was of a fine family , Sir . That Dombey was over head and ears in love with her , Sir , and that it would be a good match on both sides ; for she had beauty , blood , and talent , and Dombey had fortune ; and what more could any couple have ? Hearing Mr Dombey ’s footsteps without , the Major cut himself short by saying , that Mr Carker would see her tomorrow morning , and would judge for himself ; and between his mental excitement , and the exertion of saying all this in wheezy whispers , the Major sat gurgling in the throat and watering at the eyes , until dinner was ready . The Major , like some other noble animals , exhibited himself to great advantage at feeding - time . On this occasion , he shone resplendent at one end of the table , supported by the milder lustre of Mr Dombey at the other ; while Carker on one side lent his ray to either light , or suffered it to merge into both , as occasion arose . During the first course or two , the Major was usually grave ; for the Native , in obedience to general orders , secretly issued , collected every sauce and cruet round him , and gave him a great deal to do , in taking out the stoppers , and mixing up the contents in his plate . Besides which , the Native had private zests and flavours on a side - table , with which the Major daily scorched himself ; to say nothing of strange machines out of which he spirited unknown liquids into the Major ’s drink . But on this occasion , Major Bagstock , even amidst these many occupations , found time to be social ; and his sociality consisted in excessive slyness for the behoof of Mr Carker , and the betrayal of Mr Dombey ’s state of mind . “
192427	192432	192425	192425	Dombey	190	” said the Major , “
192443	192444	192425	192425	Dombey	190	” “
192448	192453	192446	192446	you	4844	” returned the gentleman , “
192467	192468	192460	192460	I	0	” “
192479	192484	192471	192471	Dombey	190	” asked the Major . “
192532	192609	192526	192526	I	0	” Then the Major winked at Carker , and became so frightfully sly , that his dark attendant was obliged to pat him on the back , without orders , or he would probably have disappeared under the table . In a later stage of the dinner : that is to say , when the Native stood at the Major ’s elbow ready to serve the first bottle of champagne : the Major became still slyer . “
192619	192629	192616	192616	you	190	” said the Major , holding up his glass . “
192650	192673	192646	192646	Gad	483	” said the Major , winking at his new friend , while Mr Dombey looked into his plate with a conscious air , “
192703	192708	192710	192710	her	481	” said the Major , “
192716	192717	192713	192714	angelic Edith	481	” “
192722	192728	192729	192729	Edith	481	” cried the smiling Carker . “
192735	192763	192729	192729	Edith	481	” said Mr Dombey . The entrance of the waiters with new dishes caused the Major to be slyer yet , but in a more serious vein . “
192781	192800	192801	192801	he	290	” said the Major , laying his finger on his lips , and speaking half apart to Carker , “
192832	192986	192825	192825	Sir	735	” This was respectful and becoming on the Major ’s part , and Mr Dombey plainly felt it so . Although embarrassed in his own frigid way , by the Major ’s allusions , Mr Dombey had no objection to such rallying , it was clear , but rather courted it . Perhaps the Major had been pretty near the truth , when he had divined that morning that the great man who was too haughty formally to consult with , or confide in his prime minister , on such a matter , yet wished him to be fully possessed of it . Let this be how it may , he often glanced at Mr Carker while the Major plied his light artillery , and seemed watchful of its effect upon him . But the Major , having secured an attentive listener , and a smiler who had not his match in all the world—“in
192996	193167	192825	192825	Sir	735	” as he often afterwards declared — was not going to let him off with a little slyness personal to Mr Dombey . Therefore , on the removal of the cloth , the Major developed himself as a choice spirit in the broader and more comprehensive range of narrating regimental stories , and cracking regimental jokes , which he did with such prodigal exuberance , that Carker was ( or feigned to be ) quite exhausted with laughter and admiration : while Mr Dombey looked on over his starched cravat , like the Major ’s proprietor , or like a stately showman who was glad to see his bear dancing well . When the Major was too hoarse with meat and drink , and the display of his social powers , to render himself intelligible any longer , they adjourned to coffee . After which , the Major inquired of Mr Carker the Manager , with little apparent hope of an answer in the affirmative , if he played picquet . “
193176	193181	193170	193170	I	0	” said Mr Carker . “
193186	193193	193170	193170	I	0	” observed the Major , hesitating . “
193203	193210	193196	193196	I	0	” replied the man of teeth . “
193220	193245	193211	193211	Carker	274	” said Mr Dombey , laying himself on a sofa like a man of wood , without a hinge or a joint in him ; “
193251	193287	193217	193217	I	0	” In sooth , he played the two in question , to such perfection , that the Major was astonished , and asked him , at random , if he played chess . [ Illustration ] “
193296	193300	193290	193290	I	0	” answered Carker . “
193322	193323	193301	193301	I	0	” “
193329	193336	193337	193337	you	0	” said the Major , staring , “
193348	193349	193352	193352	He	190	” “
193354	193359	193352	193352	He	190	” returned the Manager . “
193399	194147	193389	193389	they	4858	” It might be only the false mouth , so smooth and wide ; and yet there seemed to lurk beneath the humility and subserviency of this short speech , a something like a snarl ; and , for a moment , one might have thought that the white teeth were prone to bite the hand they fawned upon . But the Major thought nothing about it ; and Mr Dombey lay meditating with his eyes half shut , during the whole of the play , which lasted until bed - time . By that time , Mr Carker , though the winner , had mounted high into the Major ’s good opinion , insomuch that when he left the Major at his own room before going to bed , the Major as a special attention , sent the Native — who always rested on a mattress spread upon the ground at his master ’s door — along the gallery , to light him to his room in state . There was a faint blur on the surface of the mirror in Mr Carker ’s chamber , and its reflection was , perhaps , a false one . But it showed , that night , the image of a man , who saw , in his fancy , a crowd of people slumbering on the ground at his feet , like the poor Native at his master ’s door : who picked his way among them : looking down , maliciously enough : but trod upon no upturned face — as yet . CHAPTER XXVII . Deeper Shadows Mr Carker the Manager rose with the lark , and went out , walking in the summer day . His meditations — and he meditated with contracted brows while he strolled along — hardly seemed to soar as high as the lark , or to mount in that direction ; rather they kept close to their nest upon the earth , and looked about , among the dust and worms . But there was not a bird in the air , singing unseen , farther beyond the reach of human eye than Mr Carker ’s thoughts . He had his face so perfectly under control , that few could say more , in distinct terms , of its expression , than that it smiled or that it pondered . It pondered now , intently . As the lark rose higher , he sank deeper in thought . As the lark poured out her melody clearer and stronger , he fell into a graver and profounder silence . At length , when the lark came headlong down , with an accumulating stream of song , and dropped among the green wheat near him , rippling in the breath of the morning like a river , he sprang up from his reverie , and looked round with a sudden smile , as courteous and as soft as if he had had numerous observers to propitiate ; nor did he relapse , after being thus awakened ; but clearing his face , like one who bethought himself that it might otherwise wrinkle and tell tales , went smiling on , as if for practice . Perhaps with an eye to first impressions , Mr Carker was very carefully and trimly dressed , that morning . Though always somewhat formal , in his dress , in imitation of the great man whom he served , he stopped short of the extent of Mr Dombey ’s stiffness : at once perhaps because he knew it to be ludicrous , and because in doing so he found another means of expressing his sense of the difference and distance between them . Some people quoted him indeed , in this respect , as a pointed commentary , and not a flattering one , on his icy patron — but the world is prone to misconstruction , and Mr Carker was not accountable for its bad propensity . Clean and florid : with his light complexion , fading as it were , in the sun , and his dainty step enhancing the softness of the turf : Mr Carker the Manager strolled about meadows , and green lanes , and glided among avenues of trees , until it was time to return to breakfast . Taking a nearer way back , Mr Carker pursued it , airing his teeth , and said aloud as he did so , “
194156	194618	194153	194154	Mrs Dombey	186	” He had strolled beyond the town , and re - entered it by a pleasant walk , where there was a deep shade of leafy trees , and where there were a few benches here and there for those who chose to rest . It not being a place of general resort at any hour , and wearing at that time of the still morning the air of being quite deserted and retired , Mr Carker had it , or thought he had it , all to himself . So , with the whim of an idle man , to whom there yet remained twenty minutes for reaching a destination easily able in ten , Mr Carker threaded the great boles of the trees , and went passing in and out , before this one and behind that , weaving a chain of footsteps on the dewy ground . But he found he was mistaken in supposing there was no one in the grove , for as he softly rounded the trunk of one large tree , on which the obdurate bark was knotted and overlapped like the hide of a rhinoceros or some kindred monster of the ancient days before the Flood , he saw an unexpected figure sitting on a bench near at hand , about which , in another moment , he would have wound the chain he was making . It was that of a lady , elegantly dressed and very handsome , whose dark proud eyes were fixed upon the ground , and in whom some passion or struggle was raging . For as she sat looking down , she held a corner of her under lip within her mouth , her bosom heaved , her nostril quivered , her head trembled , indignant tears were on her cheek , and her foot was set upon the moss as though she would have crushed it into nothing . And yet almost the self - same glance that showed him this , showed him the self - same lady rising with a scornful air of weariness and lassitude , and turning away with nothing expressed in face or figure but careless beauty and imperious disdain . A withered and very ugly old woman , dressed not so much like a gipsy as like any of that medley race of vagabonds who tramp about the country , begging , and stealing , and tinkering , and weaving rushes , by turns , or all together , had been observing the lady , too ; for , as she rose , this second figure strangely confronting the first , scrambled up from the ground — out of it , it almost appeared — and stood in the way . “
194629	194656	194620	194620	me	0	” said the old woman , munching with her jaws , as if the Death ’s Head beneath her yellow skin were impatient to get out . “
194664	194669	194657	194657	I	0	” was the reply . “
194726	194727	194719	194720	pretty lady	4860	” “
194731	194748	194728	194728	I	0	” returned the lady , passing her with a dark smile , and a proud step . “
194754	194764	194766	194768	the old woman	10432	“ What ! You wo n’t give me nothing ? ”
194770	194809	194811	194813	the old woman	10432	“ You wo n’t give me nothing to tell your fortune , pretty lady ? How much will you give me to tell it , then ? Give me something , or I ’ll call it after you ! ”
194883	194898	194900	194902	the old woman	10432	“ You give me something then , or I ’ll call it after her ! ”
194917	194921	194922	194922	she	10432	“ Or come , ”
194948	194961	194922	194922	she	10432	“ give me something , or I ’ll call it after you ! ”
194962	194969	194971	194972	the Manager	11470	“ After me , old lady ! ”
194981	194984	194986	194987	the woman	9919	“ Yes , ”
195001	195005	194986	194987	the woman	9919	“ I know ! ”
195006	195012	195014	195014	Carker	274	“ What do you know ? ”
195021	195031	195014	195014	Carker	274	“ Do you know who the handsome lady is ? ”
195162	195165	195167	195169	the old woman	10432	“ Good ! ”
195171	195195	195167	195169	the old woman	10432	“ One child dead , and one child living : one wife dead , and one wife coming . Go and meet her ! ”
195253	195262	195263	195263	he	11470	“ What was that you said , Bedlamite ? ”
195339	195345	195335	195336	the woman	9919	“ Go and meet her ! ”
195468	195474	195476	195477	the lady	9737	“ My dear Mr Dombey , ”
195479	195515	195476	195477	the lady	9737	“ I am afraid we are late , but Edith has been out already looking for a favourable point of view for a sketch , and kept me waiting for her . Falsest of Majors , ”
195522	195528	195476	195477	the lady	9737	“ how do you do ? ”
195529	195533	195535	195536	Mr Dombey	190	“ Mrs Skewton , ”
195538	195546	195535	195536	Mr Dombey	190	“ let me gratify my friend Carker : ”
195573	195588	195535	195536	Mr Dombey	190	“ by presenting him to you . You have heard me mention Mr Carker . ”
195589	195598	195600	195601	Mrs Skewton	430	“ I am charmed , I am sure , ”
195646	195659	195661	195662	Mrs Skewton	430	“ Why , where , for Heaven ’s sake , is Edith ? ”
195667	195693	195661	195662	Mrs Skewton	430	“ Still at the door , giving Withers orders about the mounting of those drawings ! My dear Mr Dombey , will you have the kindness ”
195730	195733	195735	195736	Mr Dombey	190	“ Carker — ”
195754	195762	195764	195764	Edith	481	“ I am obliged to the gentleman , ”
195771	195784	195764	195764	Edith	481	“ for sparing me some annoyance from an importunate beggar just now . ”
195785	195794	195796	195797	Mr Carker	274	“ I am obliged to my good fortune , ”
195802	195822	195796	195797	Mr Carker	274	“ for the opportunity of rendering so slight a service to one whose servant I am proud to be . ”
195888	195891	195893	195894	Mrs Skewton	430	“ Really , ”
195927	196011	195914	195914	she	430	“ really now , this is one of the most enchanting coincidences that I ever heard of . The idea ! My dearest Edith , there is such an obvious destiny in it , that really one might almost be induced to cross one ’s arms upon one ’s frock , and say , like those wicked Turks , there is no What’s - his - name but Thingummy , and What - you - may - call - it is his prophet ! ”
196037	196044	196046	196047	Mr Dombey	190	“ It gives me great pleasure , ”
196053	196082	196046	196047	Mr Dombey	190	“ that a gentleman so nearly connected with myself as Carker is , should have had the honour and happiness of rendering the least assistance to Mrs Granger . ”
196089	196108	196109	196109	he	190	“ But it gives me some pain , and it occasions me to be really envious of Carker ; ”
196130	196146	196109	196109	he	190	“ envious of Carker , that I had not that honour and that happiness myself . ”
196165	196172	196174	196175	the Major	1679	“ By the Lord , Sir , ”
196193	196268	196183	196184	the waiter	4897	“ it ’s an extraordinary thing to me that no one can have the honour and happiness of shooting all such beggars through the head without being brought to book for it . But here ’s an arm for Mrs Granger if she ’ll do J. B. the honour to accept it ; and the greatest service Joe can render you , Ma’am , just now , is , to lead you into table ! ”
196299	196308	196310	196313	the lady - mother	4900	“ I am quite rejoiced , Mr Carker , ”
196328	196352	196310	196313	the lady - mother	4900	“ that you have timed your visit so happily , as to go with us today . It is the most enchanting expedition ! ”
196353	196363	196365	196365	Carker	274	“ Any expedition would be enchanting in such society , ”
196367	196381	196365	196365	Carker	274	“ but I believe it is , in itself , full of interest . ”
196382	196385	196387	196388	Mrs Skewton	430	“ Oh ! ”
196398	196430	196387	196388	Mrs Skewton	430	“ the Castle is charming!—associations of the Middle Ages — and all that — which is so truly exquisite . Do n’t you dote upon the Middle Ages , Mr Carker ? ”
196431	196437	196439	196440	Mr Carker	274	“ Very much , indeed , ”
196442	196447	196449	196449	Cleopatra	432	“ Such charming times ! ”
196451	196493	196494	196495	Mrs Skewton	430	“ So full of faith ! So vigorous and forcible ! So picturesque ! So perfectly removed from commonplace ! Oh dear ! If they would only leave us a little more of the poetry of existence in these terrible days ! ”
196527	196536	196538	196539	Mrs Skewton	430	“ We are dreadfully real , Mr Carker , ”
196541	196546	196538	196539	Mrs Skewton	430	“ are we not ? ”
196604	196613	196615	196615	Cleopatra	432	“ Pictures at the Castle , quite divine ! ”
196617	196625	196615	196615	Cleopatra	432	“ I hope you dote upon pictures ? ”
196626	196634	196636	196637	Mr Dombey	190	“ I assure you , Mrs Skewton , ”
196646	196690	196636	196637	Mr Dombey	190	“ that Carker has a very good taste for pictures ; quite a natural power of appreciating them . He is a very creditable artist himself . He will be delighted , I am sure , with Mrs Granger ’s taste and skill . ”
196691	196696	196698	196699	Major Bagstock	298	“ Damme , Sir ! ”
196701	196718	196698	196699	Major Bagstock	298	“ my opinion is , that you ’re the admirable Carker , and can do anything . ”
196719	196722	196724	196724	Carker	274	“ Oh ! ”
196729	196787	196724	196724	Carker	274	“ you are much too sanguine , Major Bagstock . I can do very little . But Mr Dombey is so generous in his estimation of any trivial accomplishment a man like myself may find it almost necessary to acquire , and to which , in his very different sphere , he is far superior , that — ”
196892	196902	196904	196905	Mr Dombey	190	“ You have been to Warwick often , unfortunately ? ”
196907	196911	196904	196905	Mr Dombey	190	“ Several times . ”
196912	196925	196904	196905	Mr Dombey	190	“ The visit will be tedious to you , I am afraid . ”
196926	196934	196904	196905	Mr Dombey	190	“ Oh no ; not at all . ”
196935	196949	196951	196952	Mrs Skewton	430	“ Ah ! You are like your cousin Feenix , my dearest Edith , ”
196954	196998	196951	196952	Mrs Skewton	430	“ He has been to Warwick Castle fifty times , if he has been there once ; yet if he came to Leamington to - morrow — I wish he would , dear angel!—he would make his fifty - second visit next day . ”
196999	197011	197013	197013	Edith	481	“ We are all enthusiastic , are we not , Mama ? ”
197020	197034	197013	197013	Edith	481	“ Too much so , for our peace , perhaps , my dear , ”
197039	197072	197013	197013	Edith	481	“ but we wo n’t complain . Our own emotions are our recompense . If , as your cousin Feenix says , the sword wears out the what’s - its - name — ”
197073	197079	197081	197081	Edith	481	“ The scabbard , perhaps , ”
197083	197107	197081	197081	Edith	481	“ Exactly — a little too fast , it is because it is bright and glowing , you know , my dearest love . ”
197778	197787	197789	197789	Cleopatra	432	“ Those darling byegone times , Mr Carker , ”
197791	197836	197789	197789	Cleopatra	432	“ with their delicious fortresses , and their dear old dungeons , and their delightful places of torture , and their romantic vengeances , and their picturesque assaults and sieges , and everything that makes life truly charming ! How dreadfully we have degenerated ! ”
197837	197846	197848	197849	Mr Carker	274	“ Yes , we have fallen off deplorably , ”
197906	197915	197917	197918	Mrs Skewton	430	“ We have no Faith left , positively , ”
197934	198012	197926	197927	Mr Dombey	190	“ We have no Faith in the dear old Barons , who were the most delightful creatures — or in the dear old Priests , who were the most warlike of men — or even in the days of that inestimable Queen Bess , upon the wall there , which were so extremely golden . Dear creature ! She was all Heart And that charming father of hers ! I hope you dote on Harry the Eighth ! ”
198013	198020	198022	198022	Carker	274	“ I admire him very much , ”
198024	198028	198030	198031	Mrs Skewton	430	“ So bluff ! ”
198033	198066	198030	198031	Mrs Skewton	430	“ was n’t he ? So burly . So truly English . Such a picture , too , he makes , with his dear little peepy eyes , and his benevolent chin ! ”
198067	198072	198074	198074	Carker	274	“ Ah , Ma’am ! ”
198079	198104	198074	198074	Carker	274	“ but if you speak of pictures , there ’s a composition ! What gallery in the world can produce the counterpart of that ? ”
198378	198393	198375	198375	Ruins	491	“ Look here , and see what We are , wedded to uncongenial Time ! ”
198486	198496	198498	198498	Cleopatra	432	“ My dearest Edith knows I was admiring her ! ”
198513	198517	198498	198498	Cleopatra	432	“ Sweet pet ! ”
198720	198734	198697	198697	himself	190	him—“Here , Carker , have the goodness to assist me , will you ? ”
198874	198880	198889	198889	he	190	“ Very true , Carker , ”
198882	198887	198889	198889	he	190	“ Indeed , Carker , ”
199173	199184	199186	199187	Mr Dombey	190	“ But I am afraid I trouble you too much , ”
199189	199202	199203	199203	she	481	“ By no means . Where would you wish it taken from ? ”
199241	199250	199252	199252	Edith	481	“ I would rather you chose for yourself , ”
199254	199258	199260	199261	Mr Dombey	190	“ Suppose then , ”
199263	199287	199260	199261	Mr Dombey	190	“ we say from here . It appears a good spot for the purpose , or — Carker , what do you think ? ”
199350	199360	199362	199362	Carker	274	“ Might I venture to suggest to Mrs Granger , ”
199364	199379	199362	199362	Carker	274	“ that that is an interesting — almost a curious — point of view ? ”
199429	199435	199437	199437	Edith	481	“ Will you like that ? ”
199442	199448	199450	199451	Mr Dombey	190	“ I shall be charmed , ”
199496	199503	199504	199504	she	481	“ My pencils are all pointless , ”
199513	199518	199504	199504	she	481	“ Pray allow me , ”
199523	199551	199504	199504	she	481	“ Or Carker will do it better , as he understands these things . Carker , have the goodness to see to these pencils for Mrs Granger . ”
199694	199710	199712	199712	Edith	481	“ Are you satisfied with that , or shall I finish it a little more ? ”
199735	199741	199743	199743	Carker	274	“ It is most extraordinary , ”
199758	199773	199743	199743	Carker	274	“ I was not prepared for anything so beautiful , and so unusual altogether . ”
200233	200240	200242	200243	Mrs Skewton	430	“ Edith , my dearest love , ”
200251	200263	200242	200243	Mrs Skewton	430	“ Mr Dombey is dying to hear you , I know . ”
200264	200284	200242	200243	Mrs Skewton	430	“ Mr Dombey has life enough left to say so for himself , Mama , I have no doubt . ”
200285	200292	200294	200295	Mr Dombey	190	“ I shall be immensely obliged , ”
200297	200303	200294	200295	Mr Dombey	190	“ What do you wish ? ”
200304	200307	200309	200310	Mr Dombey	190	“ Piano ? ”
200312	200323	200309	200310	Mr Dombey	190	“ Whatever you please . You have only to choose . ”
200526	200531	200548	200548	he	274	“ I hope so , ”

200599	200644	200645	200645	Cleopatra	432	“ I have requested Mrs Granger ’s permission to call on her to - morrow morning — for a purpose — and she has appointed twelve o’clock . May I hope to have the pleasure of finding you at home , Madam , afterwards ? ”
200697	200703	200705	200712	the Major , looking in at the door	4999	“ Dombey , come along ! ”
200714	200755	200705	200712	the Major , looking in at the door	4999	“ Damme , Sir , old Joe has a great mind to propose an alteration in the name of the Royal Hotel , and that it should be called the Three Jolly Bachelors , in honour of ourselves and Carker . ”
201000	201008	200965	200965	Cleopatra	432	“ Why do n’t you tell me , ”
201013	201025	200965	200965	Cleopatra	432	“ that he is coming here to - morrow by appointment ? ”
201026	201032	201034	201034	Edith	481	“ Because you know it , ”
201036	201039	201043	201043	she	481	“ Mother . ”
201050	201058	201059	201059	she	481	“ You know he has bought me , ”
201062	201133	201059	201059	she	481	“ Or that he will , to - morrow . He has considered of his bargain ; he has shown it to his friend ; he is even rather proud of it ; he thinks that it will suit him , and may be had sufficiently cheap ; and he will buy to - morrow . God , that I have lived for this , and that I feel it ! ”
201172	201178	201180	201182	the angry mother	5013	“ What do you mean ? ”
201184	201192	201180	201182	the angry mother	5013	“ Have n’t you from a child — ”
201193	201197	201199	201199	Edith	481	“ A child ! ”
201205	201277	201199	201199	Edith	481	“ when was I a child ? What childhood did you ever leave to me ? I was a woman — artful , designing , mercenary , laying snares for men — before I knew myself , or you , or even understood the base and wretched aim of every new display I learnt You gave birth to a woman . Look upon her . She is in her pride tonight . ”
201301	201306	201307	201307	she	5013	“ Look at me , ”
201310	201400	201307	201307	she	5013	“ who have never known what it is to have an honest heart , and love . Look at me , taught to scheme and plot when children play ; and married in my youth — an old age of design — to one for whom I had no feeling but indifference . Look at me , whom he left a widow , dying before his inheritance descended to him — a judgment on you ! well deserved!—and tell me what has been my life for ten years since . ”
201401	201418	201420	201421	her mother	718	“ We have been making every effort to endeavour to secure to you a good establishment , ”
201423	201437	201420	201421	her mother	718	“ That has been your life . And now you have got it . ”
201438	201476	201478	201478	Edith	481	“ There is no slave in a market : there is no horse in a fair : so shown and offered and examined and paraded , Mother , as I have been , for ten shameful years , ”
201495	201580	201581	201581	she	481	“ Is it not so ? Have I been made the bye - word of all kinds of men ? Have fools , have profligates , have boys , have dotards , dangled after me , and one by one rejected me , and fallen off , because you were too plain with all your cunning : yes , and too true , with all those false pretences : until we have almost come to be notorious ? The licence of look and touch , ”
201588	201662	201581	201581	she	481	“ have I submitted to it , in half the places of resort upon the map of England ? Have I been hawked and vended here and there , until the last grain of self - respect is dead within me , and I loathe myself ? Has been my late childhood ? I had none before . Do not tell me that I had , tonight of all nights in my life ! ”
201663	201671	201673	201674	her mother	718	“ You might have been well married , ”
201676	201691	201581	201581	she	481	“ twenty times at least , Edith , if you had given encouragement enough . ”
201692	201712	201713	201713	she	481	“ No ! Who takes me , refuse that I am , and as I well deserve to be , ”
201731	201895	201713	201713	she	481	“ shall take me , as this man does , with no art of mine put forth to lure him . He sees me at the auction , and he thinks it well to buy me . Let him ! When he came to view me — perhaps to bid — he required to see the roll of my accomplishments . I gave it to him . When he would have me show one of them , to justify his purchase to his men , I require of him to say which he demands , and I exhibit it . I will do no more . He makes the purchase of his own will , and with his own sense of its worth , and the power of his money ; and I hope it may never disappoint him . I have not vaunted and pressed the bargain ; neither have you , so far as I have been able to prevent you . “
201908	201909	201901	201901	Edith	481	” “
201922	201926	201901	201901	Edith	481	” said Edith . “
202003	202031	202055	202055	I	0	” There had been a touching sadness in her voice , but it was gone , when she went on to say , with a curled lip , “
202096	202097	202098	202099	This man	10241	” “
202104	202109	202101	202101	You	5017	” said her mother , “
202116	202117	202101	202101	You	5017	” “
202129	202145	202119	202119	you	5017	” she answered , stopping on her way across the room , and looking round . “
202151	202163	202147	202147	I	0	” she continued , with her eyes fixed on her mother , “
202205	202206	202212	202212	I	0	” “
202215	202221	202212	202212	I	0	” returned her mother coldly , “
202287	202415	202417	202417	Florence	197	” Edith suddenly let fall her face , as if it had been stung , and while she pressed her hands upon it , a terrible tremble crept over her whole frame . It was quickly gone ; and with her usual step , she passed out of the room . The maid who should have been a skeleton , then reappeared , and giving one arm to her mistress , who appeared to have taken off her manner with her charms , and to have put on paralysis with her flannel gown , collected the ashes of Cleopatra , and carried them away in the other , ready for tomorrow ’s revivification . CHAPTER XXVIII . Alterations So the day has come at length , Susan , ”
202423	202434	202417	202417	Florence	197	“ when we are going back to our quiet home ! ”
202460	202474	202438	202438	her	241	“ Very quiet indeed , Miss Floy , no doubt . Excessive so . ”
202475	202482	202484	202484	Florence	197	“ When I was a child , ”
202495	202528	202484	202484	Florence	197	“ did you ever see that gentleman who has taken the trouble to ride down here to speak to me , now three times — three times , I think , Susan ? ”
202529	202535	202537	202538	the Nipper	241	“ Three times , Miss , ”
202540	202552	202537	202538	the Nipper	241	“ Once when you was out a walking with them Sket — ”
202565	202591	202560	202561	Miss Nipper	241	“ With Sir Barnet and his lady , I mean to say , Miss , and the young gentleman . And two evenings since then . ”
202592	202620	202622	202622	Florence	197	“ When I was a child , and when company used to come to visit Papa , did you ever see that gentleman at home , Susan ? ”
202624	202629	202631	202632	her maid	10006	“ Well , Miss , ”
202637	202672	202673	202674	the Nipper	241	“ I really could n’t say I ever did . When your poor dear Ma died , Miss Floy , I was very new in the family , you see , and my element : ”
202691	202699	202688	202689	Mr Dombey	190	“ was the floor below the attics . ”
202700	202705	202707	202707	Florence	197	“ To be sure , ”
202712	202730	202707	202707	Florence	197	“ you are not likely to have known who came to the house . I quite forgot . ”
202731	202746	202748	202748	Susan	241	“ Not , Miss , but what we talked about the family and visitors , ”
202750	202790	202792	202792	Susan	241	“ and but what I heard much said , although the nurse before Mrs Richards make unpleasant remarks when I was in company , and hint at little Pitchers , but that could only be attributed , poor thing , ”
202798	202815	202792	202792	Susan	241	“ to habits of intoxication , for which she was required to leave , and did . ”
202854	202861	202863	202863	Susan	241	“ At all events , Miss , ”
202865	202974	202863	202863	Susan	241	“ I remember very well that this same gentleman , Mr Carker , was almost , if not quite , as great a gentleman with your Papa then , as he is now . It used to be said in the house then , Miss , that he was at the head of all your Pa ’s affairs in the City , and managed the whole , and that your Pa minded him more than anybody , which , begging your pardon , Miss Floy , he might easy do , for he never minded anybody else . I knew that , Pitcher as I might have been . ”
202990	202992	202975	202976	Susan Nipper	241	“ Pitcher ”
202995	203007	203008	203008	she	227	“ And that Mr Carker has not fallen off , Miss , ”
203011	203150	203008	203008	she	227	“ but has stood his ground , and kept his credit with your Pa , I know from what is always said among our people by that Perch , whenever he comes to the house ; and though he ’s the weakest weed in the world , Miss Floy , and no one can have a moment ’s patience with the man , he knows what goes on in the City tolerable well , and says that your Pa does nothing without Mr Carker , and leaves all to Mr Carker , and acts according to Mr Carker , and has Mr Carker always at his elbow , and I do believe that he believes ( that washiest of Perches ! ) that after your Pa , the Emperor of India is the child unborn to Mr Carker . ”
203191	203196	203197	203197	she	197	“ Yes , Susan , ”
203207	203224	203197	203197	she	197	“ He is in Papa ’s confidence , and is his friend , I am sure . ”

204631	204643	204626	204627	Mr Toots	504	“ What a surprising thing that I should see you here ! ”
204682	204689	204690	204691	Mr Toots	504	“ I never was so surprised ! ”
204693	204698	204690	204691	Mr Toots	504	exclaim.—“Is Miss Dombey there ? ”
204706	204717	204718	204718	Toots	504	“ Oh , Diogenes is quite well , Miss Dombey , ”
204722	204730	204718	204718	Toots	504	“ I called to ask this morning . ”

204978	204988	204990	204991	Mr Toots	504	“ Thank you , it ’s of no consequence , ”
204993	205027	204990	204991	Mr Toots	504	“ I thought perhaps you would n’t mind , in this fine weather , coming home by water , Miss Dombey . There ’s plenty of room in the boat for your maid . ”
205028	205037	205039	205039	Florence	196	“ I am very much obliged to you , ”
205043	205054	205039	205039	Florence	196	“ I really am — but I would rather not . ”

209045	209049	209051	209052	Miss Tox	208	“ Of weather ? ”
209058	209062	209064	209065	Mrs Chick	208	“ Of everything , ”
209067	209114	209116	209117	Mrs Chick	208	“ Of course we must . It ’s a world of change . Anyone would surprise me very much , Lucretia , and would greatly alter my opinion of their understanding , if they attempted to contradict or evade what is so perfectly evident . Change ! ”
209123	209168	209116	209117	Mrs Chick	208	“ Why , my gracious me , what is there that does _ not _ change ! even the silkworm , who I am sure might be supposed not to trouble itself about such subjects , changes into all sorts of unexpected things continually . ”
209169	209173	209175	209178	the mild Miss Tox	208	“ My Louisa , ”
209180	209188	209175	209178	the mild Miss Tox	208	“ is ever happy in her illustrations . ”
209189	209197	209199	209200	Mrs Chick	208	“ You are so kind , Lucretia , ”
209206	209240	209199	209200	Mrs Chick	208	“ as to say so , and to think so , I believe . I hope neither of us may ever have any cause to lessen our opinion of the other , Lucretia . ”
209241	209248	209250	209251	Miss Tox	208	“ I am sure of it , ”
209317	209325	209327	209328	Miss Tox	208	“ Pardon me , my dear Louisa , ”
209330	209347	209327	209328	Miss Tox	208	“ but have I caught sight of the manly form of Mr Chick in the carriage ? ”
209348	209353	209355	209356	Mrs Chick	208	“ He is there , ”
209358	209398	209355	209356	Mrs Chick	208	“ but pray leave him there . He has his newspaper , and would be quite contented for the next two hours . Go on with your flowers , Lucretia , and allow me to sit here and rest . ”
209399	209404	209406	209407	Miss Tox	275	“ My Louisa knows , ”
209409	209429	209406	209407	Miss Tox	275	“ that between friends like ourselves , any approach to ceremony would be out of the question . Therefore — ”
209477	209484	209486	209487	Mrs Chick	208	“ Florence has returned home also , ”
209511	209593	209486	209487	Mrs Chick	208	“ and really Florence is a great deal too old now , to continue to lead that solitary life to which she has been accustomed . Of course she is . There can be no doubt about it . I should have very little respect , indeed , for anybody who could advocate a different opinion . Whatever my wishes might be , I could not respect them . We can not command our feelings to such an extent as that . ”
209609	209617	209619	209620	Mrs Chick	208	“ If she ’s a strange girl , ”
209622	209717	209619	209620	Mrs Chick	208	“ and if my brother Paul can not feel perfectly comfortable in her society , after all the sad things that have happened , and all the terrible disappointments that have been undergone , then , what is the reply ? That he must make an effort . That he is bound to make an effort . We have always been a family remarkable for effort . Paul is at the head of the family ; almost the only representative of it left — for what am I — I am of no consequence — ”
209718	209723	209725	209726	Miss Tox	208	“ My dearest love , ”
209746	209812	209728	209729	Mrs Chick	208	“ And consequently he is more than ever bound to make an effort . And though his having done so , comes upon me with a sort of shock — for mine is a very weak and foolish nature ; which is anything but a blessing I am sure ; I often wish my heart was a marble slab , or a paving - stone — ”
209813	209818	209820	209821	Miss Tox	208	“ My sweet Louisa , ”
209824	209866	209868	209869	Mrs Chick	208	“ Still , it is a triumph to me to know that he is so true to himself , and to his name of Dombey ; although , of course , I always knew he would be . I only hope , ”
209875	209886	209868	209869	Mrs Chick	208	“ that she may be worthy of the name too . ”
209954	209959	209961	209962	Miss Tox	208	“ My dear Louisa , ”
209964	210003	209961	209962	Miss Tox	208	“ will it be the least satisfaction to you , if I venture to observe in reference to that remark , that I , as a humble individual , think your sweet niece in every way most promising ? ”
210004	210012	210014	210015	Mrs Chick	208	“ What do you mean , Lucretia ? ”
210023	210037	210014	210015	Mrs Chick	208	“ To what remark of mine , my dear , do you refer ? ”
210038	210049	210051	210052	Miss Tox	208	“ Her being worthy of her name , my love , ”
210054	210057	210059	210060	Mrs Chick	208	“ If , ”
210066	210183	210059	210060	Mrs Chick	208	“ I have not expressed myself with clearness , Lucretia , the fault of course is mine . There is , perhaps , no reason why I should express myself at all , except the intimacy that has subsisted between us , and which I very much hope , Lucretia — confidently hope — nothing will occur to disturb . Because , why should I do anything else ? There is no reason ; it would be absurd . But I wish to express myself clearly , Lucretia ; and therefore to go back to that remark , I must beg to say that it was not intended to relate to Florence , in any way . ”
210184	210187	210189	210190	Miss Tox	275	“ Indeed ! ”
210192	210195	210197	210198	Mrs Chick	208	“ No , ”
210203	210210	210212	210214	her meek friend	5230	“ Pardon me , my dear , ”
210216	210231	210212	210214	her meek friend	5230	“ but I can not have understood it . I fear I am dull . ”
210298	210354	210273	210274	Miss Tox	208	“ When I speak , Lucretia , of her being worthy of the name , I speak of my brother Paul ’s second wife . I believe I have already said , in effect , if not in the very words I now use , that it is his intention to marry a second wife . ”
210393	210407	210409	210410	Mrs Chick	208	“ Whether she will be fully sensible of the distinction conferred upon her , ”
210417	210494	210409	210410	Mrs Chick	208	“ is quite another question . I hope she may be . We are bound to think well of one another in this world , and I hope she may be . I have not been advised with myself . If I had been advised with , I have no doubt my advice would have been cavalierly received , and therefore it is infinitely better as it is . I much prefer it as it is . ”
210536	210583	210585	210586	Mrs Chick	208	“ If my brother Paul had consulted with me , which he sometimes does — or rather , sometimes used to do ; for he will naturally do that no more now , and this is a circumstance which I regard as a relief from responsibility , ”
210590	210600	210585	210586	Mrs Chick	208	“ for I thank Heaven I am not jealous — ”
210608	210693	210695	210696	Mrs Chick	208	“ if my brother Paul had come to me , and had said , ‘ Louisa , what kind of qualities would you advise me to look out for , in a wife ? ’ I should certainly have answered , ‘ Paul , you must have family , you must have beauty , you must have dignity , you must have connexion . ’ Those are the words I should have used . You might have led me to the block immediately afterwards , ”
210706	210772	210695	210696	Mrs Chick	208	“ but I should have used them . I should have said , ‘ Paul ! You to marry a second time without family ! You to marry without beauty ! You to marry without dignity ! You to marry without connexion ! There is nobody in the world , not mad , who could dream of daring to entertain such a preposterous idea ! ’ ”
210807	210817	210819	210821	the discreet lady	5234	“ I should have adopted this course of argument , ”
210823	210893	210895	210896	Mrs Chick	208	“ because I trust I am not a fool . I make no claim to be considered a person of superior intellect — though I believe some people have been extraordinary enough to consider me so ; one so little humoured as I am , would very soon be disabused of any such notion ; but I trust I am not a downright fool . And to tell ME , ”
210901	210922	210895	210896	Mrs Chick	208	“ that my brother Paul Dombey could ever contemplate the possibility of uniting himself to anybody — I do n’t care who”—she
210939	210979	210981	210982	Mrs Chick	208	discourse—“not possessing these requisites , would be to insult what understanding I have got , as much as if I was to be told that I was born and bred an elephant , which I may be told next , ”
210987	211000	210981	210982	Mrs Chick	208	“ It would n’t surprise me at all . I expect it . ”
211079	211243	211245	211246	Mrs Chick	208	“ Therefore , of course my brother Paul has done what was to be expected of him , and what anybody might have foreseen he would do , if he entered the marriage state again . I confess it takes me rather by surprise , however gratifying ; because when Paul went out of town I had no idea at all that he would form any attachment out of town , and he certainly had no attachment when he left here . However , it seems to be extremely desirable in every point of view . I have no doubt the mother is a most genteel and elegant creature , and I have no right whatever to dispute the policy of her living with them : which is Paul ’s affair , not mine — and as to Paul ’s choice , herself , I have only seen her picture yet , but that is beautiful indeed . Her name is beautiful too , ”
211261	211305	211249	211249	her	208	“ Edith is at once uncommon , as it strikes me , and distinguished . Consequently , Lucretia , I have no doubt you will be happy to hear that the marriage is to take place immediately — of course , you will : ”
211310	211340	211249	211249	her	208	“ and that you are delighted with this change in the condition of my brother , who has shown you a great deal of pleasant attention at various times . ”
211863	211864	211834	211835	Mrs Chick	208	” “
211867	211871	211865	211865	Lucretia	275	” said Mrs Chick “
211907	211911	211899	211900	a Saint	5249	” [ Illustration ] “
211921	211926	211899	211900	a Saint	5249	” Miss Tox faltered . “
211933	211934	211935	211935	You	275	” “
211943	211952	211941	211941	Lucretia	275	” repeated Mrs Chick , with exceeding scorn . “
211980	212003	211978	211978	you	275	” Miss Tox directed an imploring , helpless kind of look towards her friend , and put her handkerchief before her face . “
212012	212020	211978	211978	you	275	” said Mrs Chick , with majesty , “
212063	212080	212047	212048	Lucretia Tox	5251	” here Mrs Chick cast down an imaginary pair , such as are commonly used in grocers ”
212083	212123	212047	212048	Lucretia Tox	5251	“ have fallen from my sight . The blindness of my confidence is past , Lucretia . It has been abused and played , upon , and evasion is quite out of the question now , I assure you . ”
212124	212138	212140	212141	Miss Tox	275	“ Oh ! to what do you allude so cruelly , my love ? ”
212147	212150	212152	212153	Mrs Chick	208	“ Lucretia , ”
212155	212198	212152	212153	Mrs Chick	208	“ ask your own heart . I must entreat you not to address me by any such familiar term as you have just used , if you please . I have some self - respect left , though you may think otherwise . ”
212199	212204	212206	212207	Miss Tox	208	“ Oh , Louisa ! ”
212209	212219	212206	212207	Miss Tox	208	“ How can you speak to me like that ? ”
212220	212230	212232	212233	Mrs Chick	208	“ How can I speak to you like that ? ”
212260	212273	212274	212275	Miss Tox	208	“ Like that ! You may well say like that , indeed ! ”
212279	212283	212285	212286	Mrs Chick	208	“ The idea ! ”
212288	212351	212353	212354	Mrs Chick	208	“ of your having basked at my brother ’s fireside , like a serpent , and wound yourself , through me , almost into his confidence , Lucretia , that you might , in secret , entertain designs upon him , and dare to aspire to contemplate the possibility of his uniting himself to you ! Why , it is an idea , ”
212360	212370	212353	212354	Mrs Chick	208	“ the absurdity of which almost relieves its treachery . ”
212371	212376	212378	212379	Miss Tox	208	“ Pray , Louisa , ”
212381	212389	212378	212379	Miss Tox	208	“ do not say such dreadful things . ”
212390	212394	212396	212397	Mrs Chick	208	“ Dreadful things ! ”
212399	212434	212396	212397	Mrs Chick	208	“ Dreadful things ! Is it not a fact , Lucretia , that you have just now been unable to command your feelings even before me , whose eyes you had so completely closed ? ”
212435	212442	212444	212445	Miss Tox	275	“ I have made no complaint , ”
212447	212491	212444	212445	Miss Tox	275	“ I have said nothing . If I have been a little overpowered by your news , Louisa , and have ever had any lingering thought that Mr Dombey was inclined to be particular towards me , surely you will not condemn me . ”
212492	212499	212501	212502	Mrs Chick	208	“ She is going to say , ”
212522	212539	212505	212505	herself	208	“ She is going to say — I know it — that I have encouraged her ! ”
212540	212552	212554	212555	Miss Tox	208	“ I do n’t wish to exchange reproaches , dear Louisa , ”
212557	212572	212554	212555	Miss Tox	208	“ Nor do I wish to complain . But , in my own defence — ”
212573	212576	212578	212579	Mrs Chick	208	“ Yes , ”
212590	212620	212622	212623	Mrs Chick	208	“ that ’s what she ’s going to say . I knew it . You had better say it . Say it openly ! Be open , Lucretia Tox , ”
212629	212634	212622	212623	Mrs Chick	208	“ whatever you are . ”
212635	212641	212643	212644	Miss Tox	208	“ In my own defence , ”
212646	212690	212643	212644	Miss Tox	208	“ and only in my own defence against your unkind words , my dear Louisa , I would merely ask you if you have n’t often favoured such a fancy , and even said it might happen , for anything we could tell ? ”
212691	212697	212699	212700	Mrs Chick	208	“ There is a point , ”
212733	212783	212785	212786	Mrs Chick	208	“ beyond which endurance becomes ridiculous , if not culpable . I can bear much ; but not too much . What spell was on me when I came into this house this day , I do n’t know ; but I had a presentiment — a dark presentiment , ”
212792	212961	212785	212786	Mrs Chick	208	“ that something was going to happen . Well may I have had that foreboding , Lucretia , when my confidence of many years is destroyed in an instant , when my eyes are opened all at once , and when I find you revealed in your true colours . Lucretia , I have been mistaken in you . It is better for us both that this subject should end here . I wish you well , and I shall ever wish you well . But , as an individual who desires to be true to herself in her own poor position , whatever that position may be , or may not be — and as the sister of my brother — and as the sister - in - law of my brother ’s wife — and as a connexion by marriage of my brother ’s wife ’s mother — may I be permitted to add , as a Dombey?—I can wish you nothing else but good morning . ”
213138	213152	213134	213134	she	11789	“ Oh the extent to which her eyes had been opened that day ! ”
213153	213165	213167	213168	Mr Chick	213	“ To which your eyes have been opened , my dear ! ”
213170	213179	213181	213182	Mrs Chic	409	“ Oh , do n’t talk to me ! ”
213183	213213	213134	213134	she	11789	“ if you can bear to see me in this state , and not ask me what the matter is , you had better hold your tongue for ever . ”
213214	213223	213225	213226	Mr Chick	213	“ What is the matter , my dear ? ”
213227	213231	213233	213234	Mrs Chick	208	“ To think , ”
213242	213324	213233	213234	Mrs Chick	208	“ that she should ever have conceived the base idea of connecting herself with our family by a marriage with Paul ! To think that when she was playing at horses with that dear child who is now in his grave — I never liked it at the time — she should have been hiding such a double - faced design ! I wonder she was never afraid that something would happen to her . She is fortunate if nothing does . ”
213325	213333	213335	213336	Mr Chick	213	“ I really thought , my dear , ”
213353	213390	213391	213392	Mrs Chick	208	“ that you had gone on the same tack yourself , all along , until this morning ; and had thought it would be a convenient thing enough , if it could have been brought about . ”
213420	213429	213431	213432	Mrs Chick	208	“ But with Lucretia Tox I have done , ”
213451	213548	213550	213551	Mrs Chick	208	“ I can bear to resign Paul ’s confidence in favour of one who , I hope and trust , may be deserving of it , and with whom he has a perfect right to replace poor Fanny if he chooses ; I can bear to be informed , in Paul ’s cool manner , of such a change in his plans , and never to be consulted until all is settled and determined ; but deceit I can not bear , and with Lucretia Tox I have done . It is better as it is , ”
213555	213645	213550	213551	Mrs Chick	208	“ much better . It would have been a long time before I could have accommodated myself comfortably with her , after this ; and I really do n’t know , as Paul is going to be very grand , and these are people of condition , that she would have been quite presentable , and might not have compromised myself . There ’s a providence in everything ; everything works for the best ; I have been tried today but on the whole I do not regret it . ”
214302	214305	214307	214307	Florence	197	“ Mama ! ”
214313	214317	214307	214307	Florence	197	“ Come again ! ”
214318	214323	214325	214326	the lady	9737	“ Not Mama yet , ”
214343	214350	214352	214352	Florence	197	“ But very soon to be , ”
214354	214364	214352	214352	Florence	197	“ Very soon now , Florence : very soon . ”
214454	214468	214434	214434	Florence	197	“ Have you been alone , Florence , since I was here last ? ”
214469	214473	214475	214475	Florence	197	“ Oh yes ! ”
214510	214521	214523	214523	Florence	197	“ I — I — am used to be alone , ”
214525	214544	214545	214545	Florence	197	“ I do n’t mind it at all . Di and I pass whole days together , sometimes . ”
214555	214563	214545	214545	Florence	197	“ Is Di your maid , love ? ”
214564	214570	214572	214572	Florence	197	“ My dog , Mama , ”
214576	214582	214572	214572	Florence	197	“ Susan is my maid . ”
214583	214590	214592	214592	Edith	481	“ And these are your rooms , ”
214597	214626	214592	214592	Edith	481	“ I was not shown these rooms the other day . We must have them improved , Florence . They shall be made the prettiest in the house . ”
214627	214636	214572	214572	Florence	197	“ If I might change them , Mama , ”
214640	214651	214572	214572	Florence	197	“ there is one upstairs I should like much better . ”
214652	214662	214664	214664	Edith	481	“ Is this not high enough , dear girl ? ”
214668	214677	214679	214679	Florence	197	“ The other was my brother ’s room , ”
214681	214715	214679	214679	Florence	197	“ and I am very fond of it . I would have spoken to Papa about it when I came home , and found the workmen here , and everything changing ; but — ”
214731	214770	214771	214771	Edith	481	“ but I was afraid it might distress him ; and as you said you would be here again soon , Mama , and are the mistress of everything , I determined to take courage and ask you . ”
215052	215065	215067	215067	Edith	481	“ We have come to London now , my mother and I , ”

215095	215103	215105	215105	Florence	197	“ You are very kind to me , ”
215107	215117	215105	215105	Florence	197	“ dear Mama . How much I thank you ! ”
215118	215132	215134	215134	Edith	481	“ Let me say now , for it may be the best opportunity , ”
215153	215208	215209	215209	she	481	“ that when I am married , and have gone away for some weeks , I shall be easier at heart if you will come home here . No matter who invites you to stay elsewhere . Come home here . It is better to be alone than — what I would say is , ”
215215	215229	215209	215209	she	481	“ that I know well you are best at home , dear Florence . ”
215230	215241	215213	215213	herself	481	“ I will come home on the very day , Mama ”
215242	215273	215209	215209	she	481	“ Do so . I rely on that promise . Now , prepare to come with me , dear girl . You will find me downstairs when you are ready . ”
216025	216029	216031	216032	Mrs Skewton	430	“ And how , ”
216044	216066	216031	216032	Mrs Skewton	430	“ is my charming Florence ? You must come and kiss me , Florence , if you please , my love . ”
216100	216106	216108	216109	Mrs Skewton	430	“ Edith , my dear , ”
216111	216132	216133	216133	Florence	197	“ positively , I — stand a little more in the light , my sweetest Florence , for a moment . ”
216137	216146	216148	216149	her mother	718	“ You do n’t remember , dearest Edith , ”
216151	216174	216148	216149	her mother	718	“ what you were when you were about the same age as our exceedingly precious Florence , or a few years younger ? ”
216175	216183	216235	216235	her	430	“ I have long forgotten , mother . ”
216184	216191	216193	216194	Mrs Skewton	430	“ For positively , my dear , ”
216196	216223	216225	216226	Mrs Skewton	430	“ I do think that I see a decided resemblance to what you were then , in our extremely fascinating young friend . And it shows , ”
216246	216252	216235	216235	her	430	“ what cultivation will do . ”
216253	216259	216261	216261	Edith	481	“ It does , indeed , ”
216288	216309	216277	216277	herself	718	“ My charming Florence , you must come and kiss me once more , if you please , my love . ”
216327	216340	216342	216343	Mrs Skewton	430	“ And you have heard , no doubt , my darling pet , ”
216349	216375	216342	216343	Mrs Skewton	430	“ that your Papa , whom we all perfectly adore and dote upon , is to be married to my dearest Edith this day week . ”
216376	216385	216387	216387	Florence	197	“ I knew it would be very soon , ”
216389	216395	216387	216387	Florence	197	“ but not exactly when . ”
216396	216401	216403	216404	her mother	718	“ My darling Edith , ”
216408	216418	216403	216404	her mother	718	“ is it possible you have not told Florence ? ”
216419	216426	216427	216427	she	197	“ Why should I tell Florence ? ”
216702	216708	216710	216710	Florence	197	“ I hear him now ! ”
216714	216719	216710	216710	Florence	197	“ He is coming ! ”
216821	216826	216828	216828	Cleopatra	432	“ My dear Dombey , ”
216830	216842	216828	216828	Cleopatra	432	“ come here and tell me how your pretty Florence is . ”
216843	216849	216851	216852	Mr Dombey	506	“ Florence is very well , ”
216859	216863	216851	216852	Mr Dombey	506	“ At home ? ”
216864	216868	216870	216871	Mr Dombey	506	“ At home , ”
216873	216878	216880	216880	Cleopatra	432	“ My dear Dombey , ”
216886	216934	216880	216880	Cleopatra	432	“ now are you sure you are not deceiving me ? I do n’t know what my dearest Edith will say to me when I make such a declaration , but upon my honour I am afraid you are the falsest of men , my dear Dombey . ”
217051	217060	217062	217063	Mrs Skewton	430	“ Now , confess , my dear Dombey , ”
217070	217083	217062	217063	Mrs Skewton	430	“ that you never were more surprised and pleased in your life . ”
217084	217091	217093	217094	Mr Dombey	506	“ I never was more surprised , ”
217096	217104	217106	217107	Mrs Skewton	430	“ Nor pleased , my dearest Dombey ? ”
217114	217128	217130	217131	Mr Dombey	506	“ I — yes , I am exceedingly glad to meet Florence here , ”
217151	217165	217133	217133	He	506	“ Yes , I really am very glad indeed to meet Florence here . ”
217166	217174	217176	217177	Mrs Skewton	430	“ You wonder how she comes here ? ”
217179	217184	217176	217177	Mrs Skewton	430	“ do n’t you ? ”
217185	217190	217192	217193	Mr Dombey	506	“ Edith , perhaps — ”
217195	217201	217203	217203	Cleopatra	432	“ Ah ! wicked guesser ! ”
217209	217255	217206	217206	her	432	“ Ah ! cunning , cunning man ! One should n’t tell these things ; your sex , my dear Dombey , are so vain , and so apt to abuse our weakness ; but you know my open soul — very well ; immediately . ”
217271	217279	217280	217280	she	5351	“ But Edith , my dear Dombey , ”
217286	217357	217359	217359	she	5351	“ when she can not have you near her — and as I tell her , she can not expect that always — will at least have near her something or somebody belonging to you . Well , how extremely natural that is ! And in this spirit , nothing would keep her from riding off today to fetch our darling Florence . Well , how excessively charming that is ! ”
217369	217373	217365	217366	Mr Dombey	506	“ Eminently so . ”
217374	217388	217390	217390	Cleopatra	432	“ Bless you , my dear Dombey , for that proof of heart ! ”
217396	217432	217433	217433	Cleopatra	432	“ But I am growing too serious ! Take me downstairs , like an angel , and let us see what these people intend to give us for dinner . Bless you , dear Dombey ! ”
217634	217649	217651	217651	Cleopatra	432	“ And so your preparations are nearly finished at last , my dear Dombey ? ”
217671	217675	217651	217651	Cleopatra	432	“ Even the lawyers ”
217678	217679	217682	217682	madam	3633	” “
217684	217689	217682	217682	madam	3633	” replied Mr Dombey ; “
217730	217748	217749	217749	My	0	” Edith sat like a handsome statue ; as cold , as silent , and as still . “
217753	217757	217759	217759	you	13491	” said Cleopatra , “
217772	217778	217770	217770	Dombey	506	” aside to that gentleman , “
217809	217810	217811	217811	I	0	” “
217824	217837	217821	217821	you	506	” said Edith , scarcely looking over the table at Mr Dombey . “
217842	217847	217849	217849	you	13491	” suggested Mr Dombey . “
217852	217853	217849	217849	you	13491	” “
217859	217864	217849	217849	you	13491	” said Mr Dombey , “
217870	217871	217872	217872	I	0	” “
217891	217892	217888	217888	you	13491	” “
217900	217905	217888	217888	you	13491	” remonstrated her mother , “
217935	217936	217937	217937	They	5369	” “
217943	217958	217937	217937	They	5369	” returned Edith , turning on her with a slight contraction of her brow . “
217968	217969	217961	217962	Mr Dombey	506	” “
217983	217987	217961	217962	Mr Dombey	506	” said Cleopatra . “
218009	219262	219265	219265	Dombey	506	” Singular coincidence , that these gushes of interest in Florence hurried Cleopatra away from almost every dialogue in which Edith had a share , however trifling ! Florence had certainly never undergone so much embracing , and perhaps had never been , unconsciously , so useful in her life . Mr Dombey was far from quarrelling , in his own breast , with the manner of his beautiful betrothed . He had that good reason for sympathy with haughtiness and coldness , which is found in a fellow - feeling . It flattered him to think how these deferred to him , in Edith ’s case , and seemed to have no will apart from his . It flattered him to picture to himself , this proud and stately woman doing the honours of his house , and chilling his guests after his own manner . The dignity of Dombey and Son would be heightened and maintained , indeed , in such hands . So thought Mr Dombey , when he was left alone at the dining - table , and mused upon his past and future fortunes : finding no uncongeniality in an air of scant and gloomy state that pervaded the room , in colour a dark brown , with black hatchments of pictures blotching the walls , and twenty - four black chairs , with almost as many nails in them as so many coffins , waiting like mutes , upon the threshold of the Turkey carpet ; and two exhausted negroes holding up two withered branches of candelabra on the sideboard , and a musty smell prevailing as if the ashes of ten thousand dinners were entombed in the sarcophagus below it . The owner of the house lived much abroad ; the air of England seldom agreed long with a member of the Feenix family ; and the room had gradually put itself into deeper and still deeper mourning for him , until it was become so funereal as to want nothing but a body in it to be quite complete . No bad representation of the body , for the nonce , in his unbending form , if not in his attitude , Mr Dombey looked down into the cold depths of the dead sea of mahogany on which the fruit dishes and decanters lay at anchor : as if the subjects of his thoughts were rising towards the surface one by one , and plunging down again . Edith was there in all her majesty of brow and figure ; and close to her came Florence , with her timid head turned to him , as it had been , for an instant , when she left the room ; and Edith ’s eyes upon her , and Edith ’s hand put out protectingly . A little figure in a low arm - chair came springing next into the light , and looked upon him wonderingly , with its bright eyes and its old - young face , gleaming as in the flickering of an evening fire . Again came Florence close upon it , and absorbed his whole attention . Whether as a fore - doomed difficulty and disappointment to him ; whether as a rival who had crossed him in his way , and might again ; whether as his child , of whom , in his successful wooing , he could stoop to think as claiming , at such a time , to be no more estranged ; or whether as a hint to him that the mere appearance of caring for his own blood should be maintained in his new relations ; he best knew . Indifferently well , perhaps , at best ; for marriage company and marriage altars , and ambitious scenes — still blotted here and there with Florence — always Florence — turned up so fast , and so confusedly , that he rose , and went upstairs to escape them . It was quite late at night before candles were brought ; for at present they made Mrs Skewton ’s head ache , she complained ; and in the meantime Florence and Mrs Skewton talked together ( Cleopatra being very anxious to keep her close to herself ) , or Florence touched the piano softly for Mrs Skewton ’s delight ; to make no mention of a few occasions in the course of the evening , when that affectionate lady was impelled to solicit another kiss , and which always happened after Edith had said anything . They were not many , however , for Edith sat apart by an open window during the whole time ( in spite of her mother ’s fears that she would take cold ) , and remained there until Mr Dombey took leave . He was serenely gracious to Florence when he did so ; and Florence went to bed in a room within Edith ’s , so happy and hopeful , that she thought of her late self as if it were some other poor deserted girl who was to be pitied for her sorrow ; and in her pity , sobbed herself to sleep . The week fled fast . There were drives to milliners , dressmakers , jewellers , lawyers , florists , pastry - cooks ; and Florence was always of the party . Florence was to go to the wedding . Florence was to cast off her mourning , and to wear a brilliant dress on the occasion . The milliner ’s intentions on the subject of this dress — the milliner was a Frenchwoman , and greatly resembled Mrs Skewton — were so chaste and elegant , that Mrs Skewton bespoke one like it for herself . The milliner said it would become her to admiration , and that all the world would take her for the young lady ’s sister . The week fled faster . Edith looked at nothing and cared for nothing . Her rich dresses came home , and were tried on , and were loudly commended by Mrs Skewton and the milliners , and were put away without a word from her . Mrs Skewton made their plans for every day , and executed them . Sometimes Edith sat in the carriage when they went to make purchases ; sometimes , when it was absolutely necessary , she went into the shops . But Mrs Skewton conducted the whole business , whatever it happened to be ; and Edith looked on as uninterested and with as much apparent indifference as if she had no concern in it . Florence might perhaps have thought she was haughty and listless , but that she was never so to her . So Florence quenched her wonder in her gratitude whenever it broke out , and soon subdued it . The week fled faster . It had nearly winged its flight away . The last night of the week , the night before the marriage , was come . In the dark room — for Mrs Skewton ’s head was no better yet , though she expected to recover permanently to - morrow — were that lady , Edith , and Mr Dombey . Edith was at her open window looking out into the street ; Mr Dombey and Cleopatra were talking softly on the sofa . It was growing late ; and Florence , being fatigued , had gone to bed . “
219267	219271	219272	219272	you	506	” said Cleopatra , “
219290	219300	219282	219282	you	506	” Mr Dombey said he would , with pleasure . “
219337	219341	219335	219335	Dombey	481	” said Cleopatra , “
219361	219411	219412	219412	My	0	” Edith turned her head suddenly . Her listless manner was exchanged , in a moment , to one of burning interest , and , unseen in the darkness , she attended closely to their conversation . Mr Dombey would be delighted to leave Florence in such admirable guardianship . “
219416	219420	219412	219412	My	0	” returned Cleopatra , “
219454	219455	219440	219442	the dreadful lawyers	5376	” “
219468	219473	219440	219442	the dreadful lawyers	5376	” said Mr Dombey . “
219508	219509	219510	219510	I	0	” “
219516	219521	219514	219514	madam	3633	” said Mr Dombey , “

219549	219595	219547	219547	Dombey	506	” replied Cleopatra , what a courtier you are ! Though I ’ll not say so , either ; for courtiers have no heart , and yours pervades your farming life and character . And are you really going so early , my dear Dombey ! ”
219611	219624	219626	219626	Cleopatra	432	“ Is this a fact , or is it all a dream ! ”
219628	219656	219626	219626	Cleopatra	432	“ Can I believe , my dearest Dombey , that you are coming back tomorrow morning to deprive me of my sweet companion ; my own Edith ! ”
219681	219685	219687	219688	Mrs Skewton	430	“ The pang , ”
219690	219778	219779	219779	she	430	“ of consigning a child , even to you , my dear Dombey , is one of the most excruciating imaginable , and combined with a naturally delicate constitution , and the extreme stupidity of the pastry - cook who has undertaken the breakfast , is almost too much for my poor strength . But I shall rally , my dear Dombey , in the morning ; do not fear for me , or be uneasy on my account . Heaven bless you ! My dearest Edith ! ”
219783	219790	219779	219779	she	430	“ Somebody is going , pet . ”
219860	219877	219852	219852	her	481	“ Tomorrow morning I shall have the happiness of claiming this hand as Mrs Dombey ’s , ”
220101	220108	220110	220110	she	481	“ I am tired to death , ”
220112	220141	220110	220110	she	481	“ You ca n’t be trusted for a moment . You are worse than a child . Child ! No child would be half so obstinate and undutiful . ”
220142	220149	220151	220151	Edith	481	“ Listen to me , mother , ”
220169	220179	220194	220195	her mother	718	“ You must remain alone here until I return . ”
220180	220192	220194	220195	her mother	718	“ Must remain alone here , Edith , until you return ! ”
220197	220250	220251	220252	The mother	9821	“ Or in that name upon which I shall call to - morrow to witness what I do , so falsely : and so shamefully , I swear I will refuse the hand of this man in the church . If I do not , may I fall dead upon the pavement ! ”
220271	220276	220278	220278	Edith	481	“ It is enough , ”
220282	220336	220278	220278	Edith	481	“ that we are what we are . I will have no youth and truth dragged down to my level . I will have no guileless nature undermined , corrupted , and perverted , to amuse the leisure of a world of mothers . You know my meaning . Florence must go home . ”
220337	220345	220347	220349	her angry mother	5400	“ You are an idiot , Edith , ”
220351	220374	220347	220349	her angry mother	5400	“ Do you expect there can ever be peace for you in that house , till she is married , and away ? ”
220375	220392	220394	220395	her daughter	2433	“ Ask me , or ask yourself , if I ever expect peace in that house , ”
220397	220404	220394	220395	her daughter	2433	“ and you know the answer . ”
220405	220435	220436	220437	her mother	718	“ And am I to be told tonight , after all my pains and labour , and when you are going , through me , to be rendered independent , ”
220453	220484	220436	220437	her mother	718	“ that there is corruption and contagion in me , and that I am not fit company for a girl ! What are you , pray ? What are you ? ”
220485	220494	220496	220496	Edith	481	“ I have put the question to myself , ”
220507	220577	220496	220496	Edith	481	“ more than once when I have been sitting there , and something in the faded likeness of my sex has wandered past outside ; and God knows I have met with my reply . Oh mother , mother , if you had but left me to my natural heart when I too was a girl — a younger girl than Florence — how different I might have been ! ”
220644	220658	220659	220659	she	718	“ If one is to go on living through continual scenes like this , ”
220662	220706	220659	220659	she	718	“ I am sure it would be much better for me to think of some means of putting an end to my existence . Oh ! The idea of your being my daughter , Edith , and addressing me in such a strain ! ”
220707	220713	220715	220715	Edith	481	“ Between us , mother , ”
220719	220728	220715	220715	Edith	481	“ the time for mutual reproaches is past . ”
220729	220737	220739	220740	her mother	718	“ Then why do you revive it ? ”
220742	220810	220811	220811	Edith	481	“ You know that you are lacerating me in the cruellest manner . You know how sensitive I am to unkindness . At such a moment , too , when I have so much to think of , and am naturally anxious to appear to the best advantage ! I wonder at you , Edith . To make your mother a fright upon your wedding - day ! ”
220849	220859	220844	220844	she	481	“ I have said that Florence must go home . ”
220860	220865	220867	220871	the afflicted and affrighted parent	5407	“ Let her go ! ”
220875	220893	220867	220871	the afflicted and affrighted parent	5407	“ I am sure I am willing she should go . What is the girl to me ? ”
220894	220952	220954	220954	Edith	481	“ She is so much to me , that rather than communicate , or suffer to be communicated to her , one grain of the evil that is in my breast , mother , I would renounce you , as I would ( if you gave me cause ) renounce him in the church to - morrow , ”
220956	220992	220954	220954	Edith	481	“ Leave her alone . She shall not , while I can interpose , be tampered with and tainted by the lessons I have learned . This is no hard condition on this bitter night . ”
220993	221006	221008	221009	her mother	718	“ If you had proposed it in a filial manner , Edith , ”
221011	221025	221008	221009	her mother	718	“ perhaps not ; very likely not . But such extremely cutting words — ”
221026	221038	221040	221040	Edith	481	“ They are past and at an end between us now , ”
221042	221121	221040	221040	Edith	481	“ Take your own way , mother ; share as you please in what you have gained ; spend , enjoy , make much of it ; and be as happy as you will . The object of our lives is won . Henceforth let us wear it silently . My lips are closed upon the past from this hour . I forgive you your part in to - morrow ’s wickedness . May God forgive my own ! ”
222169	222596	222152	222153	Mrs Miff	511	“ ere tablet presently , against the company arrive . Mr Sownds the Beadle , who is sitting in the sun upon the church steps all this time ( and seldom does anything else , except , in cold weather , sitting by the fire ) , approves of Mrs Miff ’s discourse , and asks if Mrs Miff has heard it said , that the lady is uncommon handsome ? The information Mrs Miff has received , being of this nature , Mr Sownds the Beadle , who , though orthodox and corpulent , is still an admirer of female beauty , observes , with unction , yes , he hears she is a spanker — an expression that seems somewhat forcible to Mrs Miff , or would , from any lips but those of Mr Sownds the Beadle . In Mr Dombey ’s house , at this same time , there is great stir and bustle , more especially among the women : not one of whom has had a wink of sleep since four o’clock , and all of whom were fully dressed before six . Mr Towlinson is an object of greater consideration than usual to the housemaid , and the cook says at breakfast time that one wedding makes many , which the housemaid ca n’t believe , and do n’t think true at all . Mr Towlinson reserves his sentiments on this question ; being rendered something gloomy by the engagement of a foreigner with whiskers ( Mr Towlinson is whiskerless himself ) , who has been hired to accompany the happy pair to Paris , and who is busy packing the new chariot . In respect of this personage , Mr Towlinson admits , presently , that he never knew of any good that ever come of foreigners ; and being charged by the ladies with prejudice , says , look at Bonaparte who was at the head of ’em , and see what he was always up to ! Which the housemaid says is very true . The pastry - cook is hard at work in the funereal room in Brook Street , and the very tall young men are busy looking on . One of the very tall young men already smells of sherry , and his eyes have a tendency to become fixed in his head , and to stare at objects without seeing them . The very tall young man is conscious of this failing in himself ; and informs his comrade that it ’s his “
222599	222827	222152	222153	Mrs Miff	511	” The very tall young man would say excitement , but his speech is hazy . The men who play the bells have got scent of the marriage ; and the marrow - bones and cleavers too ; and a brass band too . The first , are practising in a back settlement near Battlebridge ; the second , put themselves in communication , through their chief , with Mr Towlinson , to whom they offer terms to be bought off ; and the third , in the person of an artful trombone , lurks and dodges round the corner , waiting for some traitor tradesman to reveal the place and hour of breakfast , for a bribe . Expectation and excitement extend further yet , and take a wider range . From Balls Pond , Mr Perch brings Mrs Perch to spend the day with Mr Dombey ’s servants , and accompany them , surreptitiously , to see the wedding . In Mr Toots ’s lodgings , Mr Toots attires himself as if he were at least the Bridegroom ; determined to behold the spectacle in splendour from a secret corner of the gallery , and thither to convey the Chicken : for it is Mr Toots ’s desperate intent to point out Florence to the Chicken , then and there , and openly to say , “
223062	223066	223014	223014	he	424	“ put about , ”
223069	223072	223014	223014	he	424	“ overhaul that “
223077	223540	223541	223541	Dombey	506	” or to stick to his own duty , and leave the Amens to him , the Captain ; one of which he repeats , whenever a pause is made by Rob the Grinder , with sonorous satisfaction . Besides all this , and much more , twenty nursery - maids in Mr Dombey ’s street alone , have promised twenty families of little women , whose instinctive interest in nuptials dates from their cradles , that they shall go and see the marriage . Truly , Mr Sownds the Beadle has good reason to feel himself in office , as he suns his portly figure on the church steps , waiting for the marriage hour . Truly , Mrs Miff has cause to pounce on an unlucky dwarf child , with a giant baby , who peeps in at the porch , and drive her forth with indignation ! Cousin Feenix has come over from abroad , expressly to attend the marriage . Cousin Feenix was a man about town , forty years ago ; but he is still so juvenile in figure and in manner , and so well got up , that strangers are amazed when they discover latent wrinkles in his lordship ’s face , and crows ’ feet in his eyes : and first observe him , not exactly certain when he walks across a room , of going quite straight to where he wants to go . But Cousin Feenix , getting up at half - past seven o’clock or so , is quite another thing from Cousin Feenix got up ; and very dim , indeed , he looks , while being shaved at Long ’s Hotel , in Bond Street . Mr Dombey leaves his dressing - room , amidst a general whisking away of the women on the staircase , who disperse in all directions , with a great rustling of skirts , except Mrs Perch , who , being ( but that she always is ) in an interesting situation , is not nimble , and is obliged to face him , and is ready to sink with confusion as she curtesys;—may Heaven avert all evil consequences from the house of Perch ! Mr Dombey walks up to the drawing - room , to bide his time . Gorgeous are Mr Dombey ’s new blue coat , fawn - coloured pantaloons , and lilac waistcoat ; and a whisper goes about the house , that Mr Dombey ’s hair is curled . A double knock announces the arrival of the Major , who is gorgeous too , and wears a whole geranium in his button - hole , and has his hair curled tight and crisp , as well the Native knows . “
223543	223553	223608	223608	Sir	735	” says the Major , putting out both hands , “
223558	223559	223560	223560	Major	298	” “
223562	223567	223560	223560	Major	298	” says Mr Dombey , “
223572	223573	223570	223570	You	298	” “
223579	223584	223575	223575	Jove	482	” says the Major , “
223594	223602	223575	223575	Jove	482	Sir,”—and here he hits himself hard upon the breast—“In
223636	223678	223679	223679	Dombey	506	” Mr Dombey smiles ; but faintly , even for him ; for Mr Dombey feels that he is going to be related to the mother , and that , under those circumstances , she is not to be joked about . “
223681	223689	223679	223679	Dombey	506	” says the Major , seeing this , “
223707	223712	223702	223703	the Lord	2214	” says the Major , “
223729	223764	223724	223727	any man in England	5460	” Here again Mr Dombey ’s assent is qualified ; because he is going to confer a great distinction on a lady ; and , no doubt , she is to be envied most . “
223772	223777	223770	223770	Sir	735	” pursues the Major , “
223822	223823	223824	223824	You	735	” “
223834	223839	223840	223840	Dombey	506	” says Mr Dombey . “
223842	223847	223848	223848	you	506	” returns the Major , “
223875	223885	223890	223890	Major	298	” says the Major , almost in a passion . “
223892	223893	223890	223890	Major	298	” “
223898	223903	223905	223905	you	506	” retorts the Major , “
223974	223975	223976	223976	My	0	” “
223981	223991	223978	223979	Major Bagstock	298	” says Mr Dombey , with a gratified air , “
223997	223998	223992	223992	you	298	” “
224004	224009	224002	224002	Sir	735	” says the Major , “
224126	224135	224124	224124	Sir	735	” concludes the Major , with great firmness , “
224143	224144	224145	224145	Major	298	” “
224147	224152	224145	224145	Major	298	” says Mr Dombey , “
224175	224176	224164	224164	I	0	” “
224183	224189	224190	224190	Dombey	237	” exclaims the choleric Major . “
224196	224197	224190	224190	Dombey	237	” “
224205	224210	224200	224200	I	0	” pursues Mr Dombey , “
224238	224239	224240	224240	Dombey	237	” “
224242	224251	224240	224240	Dombey	237	” says the Major , with appropriate action , “
224352	224420	224348	224348	God	239	” Now enters Mr Carker , gorgeous likewise , and smiling like a wedding - guest indeed . He can scarcely let Mr Dombey ’s hand go , he is so congratulatory ; and he shakes the Major ’s hand so heartily at the same time , that his voice shakes too , in accord with his arms , as it comes sliding from between his teeth . “
224427	224432	224348	224348	God	239	” says Mr Carker . “
224449	224450	224442	224442	I	0	” “
224458	224463	224456	224456	Sir	735	” says the Major . “
224472	224477	224464	224464	I	0	” says Mr Carker . “
224512	224515	224556	224556	I	0	Street”—this to Mr Dombey—“to
224571	224580	224560	224561	Mrs Dombey	186	” with a strange glance at his patron ; “
224596	224597	224560	224561	Mrs Dombey	186	” “
224606	224613	224598	224599	Mrs Dombey	186	” returns Mr Dombey , condescendingly , “
224628	224629	224622	224622	Carker	274	” “
224643	224661	224641	224641	Sir	735	” says the Major , putting down his coffee - cup , and looking at his watch , “
224670	224921	224641	224641	Sir	735	” Forth , in a barouche , ride Mr Dombey , Major Bagstock , and Mr Carker , to the church . Mr Sownds the Beadle has long risen from the steps , and is in waiting with his cocked hat in his hand . Mrs Miff curtseys and proposes chairs in the vestry . Mr Dombey prefers remaining in the church . As he looks up at the organ , Miss Tox in the gallery shrinks behind the fat leg of a cherubim on a monument , with cheeks like a young Wind . Captain Cuttle , on the contrary , stands up and waves his hook , in token of welcome and encouragement . Mr Toots informs the Chicken , behind his hand , that the middle gentleman , he in the fawn - coloured pantaloons , is the father of his love . The Chicken hoarsely whispers Mr Toots that he ’s as stiff a cove as ever he see , but that it is within the resources of Science to double him up , with one blow in the waistcoat . Mr Sownds and Mrs Miff are eyeing Mr Dombey from a little distance , when the noise of approaching wheels is heard , and Mr Sownds goes out . Mrs Miff , meeting Mr Dombey ’s eye as it is withdrawn from the presumptuous maniac upstairs , who salutes him with so much urbanity , drops a curtsey , and informs him that she believes his “
224924	225107	225108	225108	My	0	” is come . Then there is a crowding and a whispering at the door , and the good lady enters , with a haughty step . There is no sign upon her face , of last night ’s suffering ; there is no trace in her manner , of the woman on the bended knees , reposing her wild head , in beautiful abandonment , upon the pillow of the sleeping girl . That girl , all gentle and lovely , is at her side — a striking contrast to her own disdainful and defiant figure , standing there , composed , erect , inscrutable of will , resplendent and majestic in the zenith of its charms , yet beating down , and treading on , the admiration that it challenges . There is a pause while Mr Sownds the Beadle glides into the vestry for the clergyman and clerk . At this juncture , Mrs Skewton speaks to Mr Dombey : more distinctly and emphatically than her custom is , and moving at the same time , close to Edith . “
225112	225118	225108	225108	My	0	” said the good Mama , “
225164	225165	225151	225151	I	0	” “
225174	225179	225151	225151	I	0	” returns the Bridegroom . “
225238	225259	225235	225236	dear Edith	429	” The affectionate Mama presses her daughter ’s arm , as she says this ; perhaps entreating her attention earnestly . “
225268	225272	225266	225266	Dombey	186	” she resumes , “
225310	225437	225303	225303	Edith	429	” Again , the good mother presses her daughter ’s arm . Mr Dombey offers no additional remonstrance ; for the clergyman and clerk appear ; and Mrs Miff , and Mr Sownds the Beadle , group the party in their proper places at the altar rails . The sun is shining down , upon the golden letters of the ten commandments . Why does the Bride ’s eye read them , one by one ? Which one of all the ten appears the plainest to her in the glare of light ? False Gods ; murder ; theft ; the honour that she owes her mother;—which is it that appears to leave the wall , and printing itself in glowing letters , on her book ! “
225449	225465	225303	225303	Edith	429	” Cousin Feenix does that . He has come from Baden - Baden on purpose . “
225469	225480	225303	225303	Edith	429	” Cousin Feenix says — good - natured creature , Cousin Feenix—“when
225506	225507	225508	225508	I	0	” “
225519	225611	225508	225508	I	0	” saith Cousin Feenix therefore . Cousin Feenix , meaning to go in a straight line , but turning off sideways by reason of his wilful legs , gives the wrong woman to be married to this man , at first — to wit , a brides — maid of some condition , distantly connected with the family , and ten years Mrs Skewton ’s junior — but Mrs Miff , interposing her mortified bonnet , dexterously turns him back , and runs him , as on castors , full at the “
225615	225727	225508	225508	I	0	” whom Cousin Feenix giveth to married to this man accordingly . And will they in the sight of heaven — ? Ay , that they will : Mr Dombey says he will . And what says Edith ? She will . So , from that day forward , for better for worse , for richer for poorer , in sickness and in health , to love and to cherish , till death do them part , they plight their troth to one another , and are married . In a firm , free hand , the Bride subscribes her name in the register , when they adjourn to the vestry . “
225737	225766	225770	225772	this good lady	5510	” Mrs Miff says with a curtsey — to look at Mrs Miff , at such a season , is to make her mortified bonnet go down with a dip—“writes
225774	225977	225770	225772	this good lady	5510	” Mr Sownds the Beadle thinks it is a truly spanking signature , and worthy of the writer — this , however , between himself and conscience . Florence signs too , but unapplauded , for her hand shakes . All the party sign ; Cousin Feenix last ; who puts his noble name into a wrong place , and enrols himself as having been born that morning . The Major now salutes the Bride right gallantly , and carries out that branch of military tactics in reference to all the ladies : notwithstanding Mrs Skewton ’s being extremely hard to kiss , and squeaking shrilly in the sacred edifice . The example is followed by Cousin Feenix and even by Mr Dombey . Lastly , Mr Carker , with his white teeth glistening , approaches Edith , more as if he meant to bite her , than to taste the sweets that linger on her lips . There is a glow upon her proud cheek , and a flashing in her eyes , that may be meant to stay him ; but it does not , for he salutes her as the rest have done , and wishes her all happiness . “
225981	225989	225770	225772	this good lady	5510	” says he in a low voice , “
226000	226001	226002	226002	I	0	” “
226008	226112	226006	226006	Sir	735	” she answers , with a curled lip , and a heaving bosom . But , does Edith feel still , as on the night when she knew that Mr Dombey would return to offer his alliance , that Carker knows her thoroughly , and reads her right , and that she is more degraded by his knowledge of her , than by aught else ? Is it for this reason that her haughtiness shrinks beneath his smile , like snow within the hands that grasps it firmly , and that her imperious glance droops in meeting his , and seeks the ground ? “
226119	226147	226113	226113	I	0	” said Mr Carker , with a servile stooping of his neck , which the revelations making by his eyes and teeth proclaim to be a lie , “
226179	227245	226160	226161	Mrs Dombey	186	” Though she bends her head , in answer , there is something in the momentary action of her hand , as if she would crush the flowers it holds , and fling them , with contempt , upon the ground . But , she puts the hand through the arm of her new husband , who has been standing near , conversing with the Major , and is proud again , and motionless , and silent . The carriages are once more at the church door . Mr Dombey , with his bride upon his arm , conducts her through the twenty families of little women who are on the steps , and every one of whom remembers the fashion and the colour of her every article of dress from that moment , and reproduces it on her doll , who is for ever being married . Cleopatra and Cousin Feenix enter the same carriage . The Major hands into a second carriage , Florence , and the bridesmaid who so narrowly escaped being given away by mistake , and then enters it himself , and is followed by Mr Carker . Horses prance and caper ; coachmen and footmen shine in fluttering favours , flowers , and new - made liveries . Away they dash and rattle through the streets ; and as they pass along , a thousand heads are turned to look at them , and a thousand sober moralists revenge themselves for not being married too , that morning , by reflecting that these people little think such happiness ca n’t last . [ Illustration ] Miss Tox emerges from behind the cherubim ’s leg , when all is quiet , and comes slowly down from the gallery . Miss Tox ’s eyes are red , and her pocket - handkerchief is damp . She is wounded , but not exasperated , and she hopes they may be happy . She quite admits to herself the beauty of the bride , and her own comparatively feeble and faded attractions ; but the stately image of Mr Dombey in his lilac waistcoat , and his fawn - coloured pantaloons , is present to her mind , and Miss Tox weeps afresh , behind her veil , on her way home to Princess ’s Place . Captain Cuttle , having joined in all the amens and responses , with a devout growl , feels much improved by his religious exercises ; and in a peaceful frame of mind pervades the body of the church , glazed hat in hand , and reads the tablet to the memory of little Paul . The gallant Mr Toots , attended by the faithful Chicken , leaves the building in torments of love . The Chicken is as yet unable to elaborate a scheme for winning Florence , but his first idea has gained possession of him , and he thinks the doubling up of Mr Dombey would be a move in the right direction . Mr Dombey ’s servants come out of their hiding - places , and prepare to rush to Brook Street , when they are delayed by symptoms of indisposition on the part of Mrs Perch , who entreats a glass of water , and becomes alarming ; Mrs Perch gets better soon , however , and is borne away ; and Mrs Miff , and Mr Sownds the Beadle , sit upon the steps to count what they have gained by the affair , and talk it over , while the sexton tolls a funeral . Now , the carriages arrive at the Bride ’s residence , and the players on the bells begin to jingle , and the band strikes up , and Mr Punch , that model of connubial bliss , salutes his wife . Now , the people run , and push , and press round in a gaping throng , while Mr Dombey , leading Mrs Dombey by the hand , advances solemnly into the Feenix Halls . Now , the rest of the wedding party alight , and enter after them . And why does Mr Carker , passing through the people to the hall - door , think of the old woman who called to him in the Grove that morning ? Or why does Florence , as she passes , think , with a tremble , of her childhood , when she was lost , and of the visage of Good Mrs Brown ? Now , there are more congratulations on this happiest of days , and more company , though not much ; and now they leave the drawing - room , and range themselves at table in the dark - brown dining - room , which no confectioner can brighten up , let him garnish the exhausted negroes with as many flowers and love - knots as he will . The pastry - cook has done his duty like a man , though , and a rich breakfast is set forth . Mr and Mrs Chick have joined the party , among others . Mrs Chick admires that Edith should be , by nature , such a perfect Dombey ; and is affable and confidential to Mrs Skewton , whose mind is relieved of a great load , and who takes her share of the champagne . The very tall young man who suffered from excitement early , is better ; but a vague sentiment of repentance has seized upon him , and he hates the other very tall young man , and wrests dishes from him by violence , and takes a grim delight in disobliging the company . The company are cool and calm , and do not outrage the black hatchments of pictures looking down upon them , by any excess of mirth . Cousin Feenix and the Major are the gayest there ; but Mr Carker has a smile for the whole table . He has an especial smile for the Bride , who very , very seldom meets it . Cousin Feenix rises , when the company have breakfasted , and the servants have left the room ; and wonderfully young he looks , with his white wristbands almost covering his hands ( otherwise rather bony ) , and the bloom of the champagne in his cheeks . “
227250	227255	226160	226161	Mrs Dombey	186	” says Cousin Feenix , “
227292	227326	227271	227271	I	0	” The Major very hoarsely indicates his approval . Mr Carker , bending his head forward over the table in the direction of Cousin Feenix , smiles and nods a great many times . “
227336	227350	227271	227271	I	0	” Cousin Feenix beginning again , thus , comes to a dead stop . “
227355	227417	227271	227271	I	0	” says the Major , in a tone of conviction . Mr Carker softly claps his hands , and bending forward over the table again , smiles and nods a great many more times than before , as if he were particularly struck by this last observation , and desired personally to express his sense of the good it has done . “
227421	227426	227271	227271	I	0	” says Cousin Feenix , “
227495	227527	227453	227454	an orator	5516	” The Major and Mr Carker are so much delighted by this fragment of personal history , that Cousin Feenix laughs , and addressing them individually , goes on to say : “
227620	227627	227609	227609	I	0	” Here there is general applause . “
227630	227645	227609	227609	I	0	” repeats Cousin Feenix , feeling that it is a neat point which will bear repetition,—“with
227686	227722	227677	227677	he	5524	” Cousin Feenix bows to Mr Dombey ; Mr Dombey solemnly returns the bow ; everybody is more or less gratified and affected by this extraordinary , and perhaps unprecedented , appeal to the feelings . “
227727	227732	227677	227677	he	5524	” says Cousin Feenix , “
227834	227857	227784	227784	we	5526	” says Cousin Feenix , cherishing his joke , with great slyness , and finally bringing it out with a jerk , ‘ “
227863	227876	227784	227784	we	5526	” The Major falls into convulsions , and is recovered with difficulty . “
227886	227907	227878	227878	I	0	” resumes Cousin Feenix in a graver tone , as if he had suddenly become a sadder and wiser man , “
228035	228044	228053	228053	I	0	” Many smiles and nods from Mr Carker . “
228047	228052	228053	228053	I	0	” says Cousin Feenix , “
228130	229916	228119	228123	my lovely and accomplished relative	5522	” The speech of Cousin Feenix is received with great applause , and Mr Dombey returns thanks on behalf of himself and Mrs Dombey . J. B. shortly afterwards proposes Mrs Skewton . The breakfast languishes when that is done , the violated hatchments are avenged , and Edith rises to assume her travelling dress . All the servants in the meantime , have been breakfasting below . Champagne has grown too common among them to be mentioned , and roast fowls , raised pies , and lobster - salad , have become mere drugs . The very tall young man has recovered his spirits , and again alludes to the exciseman . His comrade ’s eye begins to emulate his own , and he , too , stares at objects without taking cognizance thereof . There is a general redness in the faces of the ladies ; in the face of Mrs Perch particularly , who is joyous and beaming , and lifted so far above the cares of life , that if she were asked just now to direct a wayfarer to Ball ’s Pond , where her own cares lodge , she would have some difficulty in recalling the way . Mr Towlinson has proposed the happy pair ; to which the silver - headed butler has responded neatly , and with emotion ; for he half begins to think he is an old retainer of the family , and that he is bound to be affected by these changes . The whole party , and especially the ladies , are very frolicsome . Mr Dombey ’s cook , who generally takes the lead in society , has said , it is impossible to settle down after this , and why not go , in a party , to the play ? Everybody ( Mrs Perch included ) has agreed to this ; even the Native , who is tigerish in his drink , and who alarms the ladies ( Mrs Perch particularly ) by the rolling of his eyes . One of the very tall young men has even proposed a ball after the play , and it presents itself to no one ( Mrs Perch included ) in the light of an impossibility . Words have arisen between the housemaid and Mr Towlinson ; she , on the authority of an old saw , asserting marriages to be made in Heaven : he , affecting to trace the manufacture elsewhere ; he , supposing that she says so , because she thinks of being married her own self : she , saying , Lord forbid , at any rate , that she should ever marry him . To calm these flying taunts , the silver - headed butler rises to propose the health of Mr Towlinson , whom to know is to esteem , and to esteem is to wish well settled in life with the object of his choice , wherever ( here the silver - headed butler eyes the housemaid ) she may be . Mr Towlinson returns thanks in a speech replete with feeling , of which the peroration turns on foreigners , regarding whom he says they may find favour , sometimes , with weak and inconstant intellects that can be led away by hair , but all he hopes , is , he may never hear of no foreigner never boning nothing out of no travelling chariot . The eye of Mr Towlinson is so severe and so expressive here , that the housemaid is turning hysterical , when she and all the rest , roused by the intelligence that the Bride is going away , hurry upstairs to witness her departure . The chariot is at the door ; the Bride is descending to the hall , where Mr Dombey waits for her . Florence is ready on the staircase to depart too ; and Miss Nipper , who has held a middle state between the parlour and the kitchen , is prepared to accompany her . As Edith appears , Florence hastens towards her , to bid her farewell . Is Edith cold , that she should tremble ! Is there anything unnatural or unwholesome in the touch of Florence , that the beautiful form recedes and contracts , as if it could not bear it ! Is there so much hurry in this going away , that Edith , with a wave of her hand , sweeps on , and is gone ! Mrs Skewton , overpowered by her feelings as a mother , sinks on her sofa in the Cleopatra attitude , when the clatter of the chariot wheels is lost , and sheds several tears . The Major , coming with the rest of the company from table , endeavours to comfort her ; but she will not be comforted on any terms , and so the Major takes his leave . Cousin Feenix takes his leave , and Mr Carker takes his leave . The guests all go away . Cleopatra , left alone , feels a little giddy from her strong emotion , and falls asleep . Giddiness prevails below stairs too . The very tall young man whose excitement came on so soon , appears to have his head glued to the table in the pantry , and can not be detached from it . A violent revulsion has taken place in the spirits of Mrs Perch , who is low on account of Mr Perch , and tells cook that she fears he is not so much attached to his home , as he used to be , when they were only nine in family . Mr Towlinson has a singing in his ears and a large wheel going round and round inside his head . The housemaid wishes it was n’t wicked to wish that one was dead . There is a general delusion likewise , in these lower regions , on the subject of time ; everybody conceiving that it ought to be , at the earliest , ten o’clock at night , whereas it is not yet three in the afternoon . A shadowy idea of wickedness committed , haunts every individual in the party ; and each one secretly thinks the other a companion in guilt , whom it would be agreeable to avoid . No man or woman has the hardihood to hint at the projected visit to the play . Anyone reviving the notion of the ball , would be scouted as a malignant idiot . Mrs Skewton sleeps upstairs , two hours afterwards , and naps are not yet over in the kitchen . The hatchments in the dining - room look down on crumbs , dirty plates , spillings of wine , half - thawed ice , stale discoloured heel - taps , scraps of lobster , drumsticks of fowls , and pensive jellies , gradually resolving themselves into a lukewarm gummy soup . The marriage is , by this time , almost as denuded of its show and garnish as the breakfast . Mr Dombey ’s servants moralise so much about it , and are so repentant over their early tea , at home , that by eight o’clock or so , they settle down into confirmed seriousness ; and Mr Perch , arriving at that time from the City , fresh and jocular , with a white waistcoat and a comic song , ready to spend the evening , and prepared for any amount of dissipation , is amazed to find himself coldly received , and Mrs Perch but poorly , and to have the pleasing duty of escorting that lady home by the next omnibus . Night closes in . Florence , having rambled through the handsome house , from room to room , seeks her own chamber , where the care of Edith has surrounded her with luxuries and comforts ; and divesting herself of her handsome dress , puts on her old simple mourning for dear Paul , and sits down to read , with Diogenes winking and blinking on the ground beside her . But Florence can not read tonight . The house seems strange and new , and there are loud echoes in it . There is a shadow on her heart : she knows not why or what : but it is heavy . Florence shuts her book , and gruff Diogenes , who takes that for a signal , puts his paws upon her lap , and rubs his ears against her caressing hands . But Florence can not see him plainly , in a little time , for there is a mist between her eyes and him , and her dead brother and dead mother shine in it like angels . Walter , too , poor wandering shipwrecked boy , oh , where is he ? The Major do n’t know ; that ’s for certain ; and do n’t care . The Major , having choked and slumbered , all the afternoon , has taken a late dinner at his club , and now sits over his pint of wine , driving a modest young man , with a fresh - coloured face , at the next table ( who would give a handsome sum to be able to rise and go away , but can not do it ) to the verge of madness , by anecdotes of Bagstock , Sir , at Dombey ’s wedding , and Old Joe ’s devilish gentle manly friend , Lord Feenix . While Cousin Feenix , who ought to be at Long ’s , and in bed , finds himself , instead , at a gaming - table , where his wilful legs have taken him , perhaps , in his own despite . Night , like a giant , fills the church , from pavement to roof , and holds dominion through the silent hours . Pale dawn again comes peeping through the windows : and , giving place to day , sees night withdraw into the vaults , and follows it , and drives it out , and hides among the dead . The timid mice again cower close together , when the great door clashes , and Mr Sownds and Mrs Miff treading the circle of their daily lives , unbroken as a marriage ring , come in . Again , the cocked hat and the mortified bonnet stand in the background at the marriage hour ; and again this man taketh this woman , and this woman taketh this man , on the solemn terms : “
229956	230488	230545	230545	Captain	1240	” The very words that Mr Carker rides into town repeating , with his mouth stretched to the utmost , as he picks his dainty way . CHAPTER XXXII . The Wooden Midshipman goes to Pieces Honest Captain Cuttle , as the weeks flew over him in his fortified retreat , by no means abated any of his prudent provisions against surprise , because of the non - appearance of the enemy . The Captain argued that his present security was too profound and wonderful to endure much longer ; he knew that when the wind stood in a fair quarter , the weathercock was seldom nailed there ; and he was too well acquainted with the determined and dauntless character of Mrs MacStinger , to doubt that that heroic woman had devoted herself to the task of his discovery and capture . Trembling beneath the weight of these reasons , Captain Cuttle lived a very close and retired life ; seldom stirring abroad until after dark ; venturing even then only into the obscurest streets ; never going forth at all on Sundays ; and both within and without the walls of his retreat , avoiding bonnets , as if they were worn by raging lions . The Captain never dreamed that in the event of his being pounced upon by Mrs MacStinger , in his walks , it would be possible to offer resistance . He felt that it could not be done . He saw himself , in his mind ’s eye , put meekly in a hackney - coach , and carried off to his old lodgings . He foresaw that , once immured there , he was a lost man : his hat gone ; Mrs MacStinger watchful of him day and night ; reproaches heaped upon his head , before the infant family ; himself the guilty object of suspicion and distrust ; an ogre in the children ’s eyes , and in their mother ’s a detected traitor . A violent perspiration , and a lowness of spirits , always came over the Captain as this gloomy picture presented itself to his imagination . It generally did so previous to his stealing out of doors at night for air and exercise . Sensible of the risk he ran , the Captain took leave of Rob , at those times , with the solemnity which became a man who might never return : exhorting him , in the event of his ( the Captain ’s ) being lost sight of , for a time , to tread in the paths of virtue , and keep the brazen instruments well polished . But not to throw away a chance ; and to secure to himself a means , in case of the worst , of holding communication with the external world ; Captain Cuttle soon conceived the happy idea of teaching Rob the Grinder some secret signal , by which that adherent might make his presence and fidelity known to his commander , in the hour of adversity . After much cogitation , the Captain decided in favour of instructing him to whistle the marine melody , “
230494	230526	230545	230545	Captain	1240	” and Rob the Grinder attaining a point as near perfection in that accomplishment as a landsman could hope to reach , the Captain impressed these mysterious instructions on his mind : “
230541	230542	230537	230537	I	0	” “
230547	230558	230545	230545	Captain	1240	” interposed Rob , with his round eyes wide open . “
230561	230567	230545	230545	Captain	1240	” said Captain Cuttle darkly , “
230605	230692	230728	230729	the Captain	10100	“ ere tune near my old moorings — not as if you was a meaning of it , you understand , but as if you ’d drifted there , promiscuous . If I answer in that tune , you sheer off , my lad , and come back four - and - twenty hours arterwards ; if I answer in another tune , do you stand off and on , and wait till I throw out further signals . Do you understand them orders , now ? ”
230693	230706	230708	230708	Rob	424	“ What am I to stand off and on of , Captain ? ”
230710	230716	230708	230708	Rob	424	“ The horse - road ? ”
230717	230726	230728	230729	the Captain	10100	“ Here ’s a smart lad for you ! ”
230734	230758	230728	230729	the Captain	10100	“ as do n’t know his own native alphabet ! Go away a bit and come back again alternate — d’ye understand that ? ”
230759	230764	230766	230766	Rob	424	“ Yes , Captain , ”
230768	230776	230778	230779	the Captain	10100	“ Very good my lad , then , ”
230783	230787	230778	230779	the Captain	10100	“ Do it ! ”
232051	232052	232248	232248	Captain	1240	“ Wal”r
232053	232231	232248	232248	Captain	1240	” in the house;—here the Captain transferred his sleeve for a moment from the Midshipman ’s uniform to his own cheek;—the familiar wig and buttons of Sol Gills were a vision of the past ; Richard Whittington was knocked on the head ; and every plan and project in connexion with the Midshipman , lay drifting , without mast or rudder , on the waste of waters . As the Captain , with a dejected face , stood revolving these thoughts , and polishing the Midshipman , partly in the tenderness of old acquaintance , and partly in the absence of his mind , a knocking at the shop - door communicated a frightful start to the frame of Rob the Grinder , seated on the counter , whose large eyes had been intently fixed on the Captain ’s face , and who had been debating within himself , for the five hundredth time , whether the Captain could have done a murder , that he had such an evil conscience , and was always running away . “
232236	232243	232244	232244	Somebody	1665	” said Captain Cuttle , softly . “
232250	232347	232244	232244	Somebody	1665	” answered Rob the Grinder . The Captain , with an abashed and guilty air , immediately walked on tiptoe to the little parlour and locked himself in . Rob , opening the door , would have parleyed with the visitor on the threshold if the visitor had come in female guise ; but the figure being of the male sex , and Rob ’s orders only applying to women , Rob held the door open and allowed it to enter : which it did very quickly , glad to get out of the driving rain . “
232358	232382	232244	232244	Somebody	1665	” said the visitor , looking over his shoulder compassionately at his own legs , which were very wet and covered with splashes . “
232394	232423	232391	232392	Mr Gills	248	” The salutation was addressed to the Captain , now emerging from the back parlour with a most transparent and utterly futile affectation of coming out by accidence . “
232426	232438	232391	232392	Mr Gills	248	” the gentleman went on to say in the same breath ; “
232460	232537	232538	232538	I	0	” The Captain remembered to have seen this young gentleman at the wedding , and made him a bow . Mr Toots replied with a chuckle ; and being embarrassed , as he generally was , breathed hard , shook hands with the Captain for a long time , and then falling on Rob the Grinder , in the absence of any other resource , shook hands with him in a most affectionate and cordial manner . “
232558	232570	232571	232571	I	0	” said Toots at length , with surprising presence of mind . “
232579	232604	232574	232574	Miss	5618	” The Captain , with responsive gravity and mystery , immediately waved his hook towards the little parlour , whither Mr Toots followed him . “
232613	232643	232609	232609	your	248	” said Mr Toots , looking up in the Captain ’s face as he sat down in a chair by the fire , which the Captain placed for him ; “
232661	232662	232656	232656	you	248	” “
232666	232671	232663	232664	The Chicken	504	” said the Captain . “
232676	232733	232672	232674	The Game Chicken	453	” said Mr Toots . The Captain shaking his head , Mr Toots explained that the man alluded to was the celebrated public character who had covered himself and his country with glory in his contest with the Nobby Shropshire One ; but this piece of information did not appear to enlighten the Captain very much . “
232743	232748	232735	232735	he	5067	” said Mr Toots . “
232765	232766	232767	232767	I	0	” “
232778	232783	232767	232767	I	0	” said the Captain . “
232804	232809	232787	232787	you	0	” chuckled Mr Toots , “
232844	232909	232841	232842	Mr Gills	248	” [ Illustration ] With that , Mr Toots repairing to the shop - door , sent a peculiar whistle into the night , which produced a stoical gentleman in a shaggy white great - coat and a flat - brimmed hat , with very short hair , a broken nose , and a considerable tract of bare and sterile country behind each ear . “
232915	232952	232913	232913	Chicken	504	” said Mr Toots . The compliant Chicken spat out some small pieces of straw on which he was regaling himself , and took in a fresh supply from a reserve he carried in his hand . “
232966	232973	232913	232913	Chicken	504	” said the Chicken , generally . “
232990	233023	232913	232913	Chicken	504	” Captain Cuttle proffered a glass of rum , which the Chicken , throwing back his head , emptied into himself , as into a cask , after proposing the brief sentiment , “
233027	233051	233052	233053	Mr Gills	248	” Mr Toots and the Captain returning then to the parlour , and taking their seats before the fire , Mr Toots began : “
233055	233056	233052	233053	Mr Gills	248	” “
233059	233064	233068	233068	Cuttle	250	” said the Captain . “
233070	233083	233068	233068	Cuttle	250	” Mr Toots looked greatly disconcerted , while the Captain proceeded gravely . “
233111	233123	233068	233068	Cuttle	250	” said the Captain , as an index to his authority . “
233136	233141	233134	233134	I	0	” said Mr Toots ; “
233144	233145	233134	233134	I	0	” “
233156	233174	233175	233176	old Sol	248	” said the Captain , impressively , and laying his heavy hand on Mr Toots ’s knee , “
233224	233249	233219	233219	you	0	” said the Captain , apprised by the face of Mr Toots that he was making a profound impression on that gentleman ’s mind . “
233255	233282	233251	233251	he	248	” Mr Toots in his agitation was going to reply that it was of no consequence at all . But he corrected himself , and said , “
233287	233288	233251	233251	he	248	” “
233293	233298	233251	233251	he	248	” said the Captain , “
233375	233380	233369	233369	he	5629	” said the Captain , “
233416	233417	233420	233421	good Gracious	525	” “
233429	233434	233423	233424	Miss Dombey	287	” Mr Toots began . “
233446	233455	233437	233437	I	0	” said the Captain , dropping his voice , “
233515	233516	233511	233511	you	5633	” “
233522	233537	233517	233517	I	0	” chuckled Mr Toots , with a conscious blush that suffused his whole countenance . “
233545	233550	233539	233539	you	5633	” said the Captain . “
233556	233561	233551	233551	I	0	” chuckled Mr Toots . “
233570	233575	233551	233551	I	0	” said the Captain , “
233588	233606	233585	233586	a angel	5637	” Mr Toots instantly seized the Captain ’s hand , and requested the favour of his friendship . “
233613	233620	233585	233586	a angel	5637	” said Mr Toots , earnestly , “
233685	233695	233682	233683	The Chicken	5067	” said Mr Toots , in a forlorn whisper , “
233773	233778	233770	233770	you	1240	” said Mr Toots , “
233794	233817	233788	233788	you	1240	” Captain Cuttle received this proposal in a polite manner , but still without committing himself to its acceptance ; merely observing , “
233833	233857	233829	233829	we	5650	” and reminding Mr Toots of his immediate mission , by inquiring to what he was indebted for the honour of that visit . “
233863	233868	233829	233829	we	5650	” replied Mr Toots , “
233912	233922	233924	233925	Mr Toots	504	“ And I ’ll tell you how it happens , ”
233927	233976	233924	233925	Mr Toots	504	“ You know , I go and call sometimes , on Miss Dombey . I do n’t go there on purpose , you know , but I happen to be in the neighbourhood very often ; and when I find myself there , why — why I call . ”
233977	233980	233982	233983	the Captain	10100	“ Nat’rally , ”
233985	233988	233990	233991	Mr Toots	504	“ Yes , ”
233993	234025	233990	233991	Mr Toots	504	“ I called this afternoon . Upon my word and honour , I do n’t think it ’s possible to form an idea of the angel Miss Dombey was this afternoon . ”
234054	234061	234063	234064	Mr Toots	504	“ As I was coming out , ”
234066	234083	234063	234064	Mr Toots	504	“ the young woman , in the most unexpected manner , took me into the pantry . ”
234118	234124	234126	234127	Mr Toots	504	“ Where she brought out , ”
234129	234194	234126	234127	Mr Toots	504	“ this newspaper . She told me that she had kept it from Miss Dombey all day , on account of something that was in it , about somebody that she and Dombey used to know ; and then she read the passage to me . Very well . Then she said — wait a minute ; what was it she said , though ! ”
234242	234245	234247	234248	Mr Toots	504	“ Oh ! ”
234253	234357	234359	234360	Mr Toots	504	“ Oh , ah ! Yes ! She said that she hoped there was a bare possibility that it might n’t be true ; and that as she could n’t very well come out herself , without surprising Miss Dombey , would I go down to Mr Solomon Gills the Instrument - maker ’s in this street , who was the party ’s Uncle , and ask whether he believed it was true , or had heard anything else in the City . She said , if he could n’t speak to me , no doubt Captain Cuttle could . By the bye ! ”
234369	234375	234359	234360	Mr Toots	504	“ you , you know ! ”
234394	234397	234399	234400	Mr Toots	504	“ Well , ”
234402	234456	234457	234458	The Captain	10100	“ the reason why I ’m rather late is , because I went up as far as Finchley first , to get some uncommonly fine chickweed that grows there , for Miss Dombey ’s bird . But I came on here , directly afterwards . You ’ve seen the paper , I suppose ? ”
234486	234495	234497	234498	Mr Toots	504	“ Shall I read the passage to you ? ”
234520	234575	234577	234578	Mr Toots	504	“ ‘ Southampton . The barque Defiance , Henry James , Commander , arrived in this port today , with a cargo of sugar , coffee , and rum , reports that being becalmed on the sixth day of her passage home from Jamaica , in’—in such and such a latitude , you know , ”
234594	234597	234599	234600	the Captain	10100	“ Ay ! ”
234610	234617	234599	234600	the Captain	10100	“ Heave ahead , my lad ! ”
234618	234622	234624	234625	Mr Toots	504	“ — latitude , ”
234635	234737	234624	234625	Mr Toots	504	“ and longitude so - and - so,—‘the look - out observed , half an hour before sunset , some fragments of a wreck , drifting at about the distance of a mile . The weather being clear , and the barque making no way , a boat was hoisted out , with orders to inspect the same , when they were found to consist of sundry large spars , and a part of the main rigging of an English brig , of about five hundred tons burden , together with a portion of the stem on which the words and letters “
234741	234840	234841	234842	Captain Cuttle	250	” were yet plainly legible . No vestige of any dead body was to be seen upon the floating fragments . Log of the Defiance states , that a breeze springing up in the night , the wreck was seen no more . There can be no doubt that all surmises as to the fate of the missing vessel , the Son and Heir , port of London , bound for Barbados , are now set at rest for ever ; that she broke up in the last hurricane ; and that every soul on board perished . ’ ”
234943	234945	234935	234935	his	10100	“ Oh ”
234952	234969	234935	234935	his	10100	” cried Mr Toots , whose tender heart was moved by the Captain ’s unexpected distress , “
235037	235080	235089	235090	the Captain	10100	” Captain Cuttle , without altering his position , signed to Mr Toots not to mind him ; and presently turned round , with his glazed hat thrust back upon his ears , and his hand composing and smoothing his brown face . “
235081	235087	235089	235090	the Captain	10100	Wal”r , my dear lad , ”
235092	235095	235089	235090	the Captain	10100	“ farewell ! Wal”r
235116	235124	235109	235109	He	10022	” said the Captain , looking at the fire—“I
235147	235152	235154	235155	the Captain	10100	Wal”r . For why ? ”
235157	235211	235154	235155	the Captain	10100	“ Because it ai n’t one loss , but a round dozen . Where ’s that there young school - boy with the rosy face and curly hair , that used to be as merry in this here parlour , come round every week , as a piece of music ? Gone down with Wal”r
235257	235292	235322	235322	they	5682	Wal”r . Where ’s that there man ’s spirit , all afire , that would n’t see the old man hove down for a minute , and cared nothing for itself ? Gone down with Wal”r
235298	235304	235322	235322	they	5682	Wal”r . There was a dozen Wal”rs
235331	235350	235322	235322	they	5682	” Mr Toots sat silent : folding and refolding the newspaper as small as possible upon his knee . “
235355	235365	235352	235353	Sol Gills	248	” said the Captain , gazing at the fire , “
235444	235454	235438	235439	Sol Gills	248	” said the Captain , shaking his head slowly , “
235471	235493	235525	235526	the Captain	10100	Wal”r by , to say a word ; and broadside to you broach , and down you pitch , head foremost ! ”
235519	235523	235525	235526	the Captain	10100	“ My lad , ”
235528	235583	235585	235586	the Captain	10100	“ you must tell the young woman honestly that this here fatal news is too correct . They do n’t romance , you see , on such pints . It ’s entered on the ship ’s log , and that ’s the truest book as a man can write . To - morrow morning , ”
235588	235648	235585	235586	the Captain	10100	“ I ’ll step out and make inquiries ; but they ’ll lead to no good . They ca n’t do it . If you ’ll give me a look - in in the forenoon , you shall know what I have heerd ; but tell the young woman from Cap’en Cuttle , that it ’s over . Over ! ”
235687	235694	235696	235697	Mr Toots	504	“ Oh ! I assure you , ”
235699	235740	235696	235697	Mr Toots	504	“ really I am dreadfully sorry . Upon my word I am , though I was n’t acquainted with the party . Do you think Miss Dombey will be very much affected , Captain Gills — I mean Mr Cuttle ? ”
235741	235748	235750	235751	the Captain	10100	“ Why , Lord love you , ”
235763	235784	235750	235751	the Captain	10100	“ When she warn’t no higher than that , they were as fond of one another as two young doves . ”
235785	235790	235792	235793	Mr Toots	504	“ Were they though ! ”
235801	235809	235811	235812	the Captain	10100	“ They were made for one another , ”
235816	235823	235811	235812	the Captain	10100	“ but what signifies that now ! ”
235824	235831	235833	235834	Mr Toots	504	“ Upon my word and honour , ”
235850	235883	235838	235838	his	504	“ I ’m even more sorry than I was before . You know , Captain Gills , I — I positively adore Miss Dombey;—I — I am perfectly sore with loving her ; ”
235906	235949	235951	235952	Mr Toots	504	“ but what would be the good of my regarding her in this manner , if I was n’t truly sorry for her feeling pain , whatever was the cause of it . Mine ai n’t a selfish affection , you know , ”
235970	236032	236036	236037	Mr Toots	504	“ It ’s the sort of thing with me , Captain Gills , that if I could be run over — or — or trampled upon — or — or thrown off a very high place - or anything of that sort — for Miss Dombey ’s sake , it would be the most delightful thing that could happen to me . ”
236121	236127	236129	236130	Mr Toots	504	“ Thankee , Captain Gills , ”
236132	236186	236188	236189	Mr Toots	504	“ it ’s kind of you , in the midst of your own troubles , to say so . I ’m very much obliged to you . As I said before , I really want a friend , and should be glad to have your acquaintance . Although I am very well off , ”
236194	236296	236188	236189	Mr Toots	504	“ you ca n’t think what a miserable Beast I am . The hollow crowd , you know , when they see me with the Chicken , and characters of distinction like that , suppose me to be happy ; but I ’m wretched . I suffer for Miss Dombey , Captain Gills . I ca n’t get through my meals ; I have no pleasure in my tailor ; I often cry when I ’m alone . I assure you it ’ll be a satisfaction to me to come back to - morrow , or to come back fifty times . ”
236606	236612	236614	236615	Mr Carker	274	“ Well , Captain Cuttle , ”
236632	236639	236614	236615	Mr Carker	274	“ this is a bad business . ”
236640	236654	236656	236657	the Captain	10100	“ You have received the news as was in print yesterday , Sir ? ”
236659	236662	236664	236665	Mr Carker	274	“ Yes , ”
236667	236697	236664	236665	Mr Carker	274	“ we have received it ! It was accurately stated . The underwriters suffer a considerable loss . We are very sorry . No help ! Such is life ! ”
236724	236731	236733	236733	Carker	274	“ I excessively regret poor Gay , ”
236735	236778	236733	236733	Carker	274	“ and the crew . I understand there were some of our very best men among ’em . It always happens so . Many men with families too . A comfort to reflect that poor Gay had no family , Captain Cuttle ! ”
236810	236823	236824	236824	he	11470	“ Is there anything I can do for you , Captain Cuttle ? ”
236840	236860	236862	236863	the Captain	10100	“ I wish you could set my mind at rest , Sir , on something it ’s uneasy about , ”
236865	236868	236870	236871	the Manager	11470	“ Ay ! ”
236873	236900	236870	236871	the Manager	11470	“ what ’s that ? Come , Captain Cuttle , I must trouble you to be quick , if you please . I am much engaged . ”
236901	236907	236909	236910	the Captain	10100	“ Lookee here , Sir , ”
236916	236920	236870	236871	the Manager	11470	“ Afore my friend Wal”r
236928	236929	236870	236871	the Manager	11470	” “
236937	236943	236934	236935	Captain Cuttle	392	” interposed the smiling Manager , “
237055	237056	237057	237057	My	0	” “
237060	237065	237057	237057	My	0	” returned the Captain , slowly—“you
237300	237326	237328	237329	the Captain	10100	Wal”r told me ; and that the wind was truly in his sail , when he highsted of it for Barbados Harbour . Mr Carker , ”
237338	237399	237328	237329	the Captain	10100	“ when I was here last , we was very pleasant together . If I ai n’t been altogether so pleasant myself this morning , on account of this poor lad , and if I have chafed again any observation of yours that I might have fended off , my name is Ed’ard Cuttle , and I ask your pardon . ”
237400	237404	237406	237407	the Manager	11470	“ Captain Cuttle , ”
237414	237425	237406	237407	the Manager	11470	“ I must ask you to do me a favour . ”
237426	237434	237436	237437	the Captain	10100	“ And what is it , Sir ? ”
237439	237452	237454	237455	the Manager	11470	“ To have the goodness to walk off , if you please , ”
237462	237471	237459	237459	his	11470	“ and to carry your jargon somewhere else . ”
237503	237512	237514	237515	the Manager	11470	“ I tell you what , Captain Cuttle , ”
237535	237606	237514	237515	the Manager	11470	“ I was much too lenient with you when you came here before . You belong to an artful and audacious set of people . In my desire to save young what’s - his - name from being kicked out of this place , neck and crop , my good Captain , I tolerated you ; but for once , and only once . Now , go , my friend ! ”
237619	237622	237624	237628	the good - humoured Manager	5753	“ Go , ”
237644	237692	237693	237694	The Captain	10100	“ like a sensible fellow , and let us have no turning out , or any such violent measures . If Mr Dombey were here , Captain , you might be obliged to leave in a more ignominious manner , possibly . I merely say , Go ! ”
237745	237753	237755	237755	Carker	274	“ You are deep , Captain Cuttle , ”
237792	237824	237790	237790	himself	274	“ but you are not quite out of soundings , either — neither you nor your absent friend , Captain . What have you done with your absent friend , hey ? ”
237845	237849	237841	237841	he	10100	“ stand by ! ”
237855	237886	237888	237888	Carker	274	“ You hatch nice little plots , and hold nice little councils , and make nice little appointments , and receive nice little visitors , too , Captain , hey ? ”
237904	237945	237891	237891	his	274	“ but it ’s a bold measure to come here afterwards . Not like your discretion ! You conspirators , and hiders , and runners - away , should know better than that . Will you oblige me by going ? ”
237946	237950	237952	237953	the Captain	10100	“ My lad , ”
237974	238006	237952	237953	the Captain	10100	“ there ’s a many words I could wish to say to you , but I do n’t rightly know where they ’re stowed just at present . My young friend , Wal”r
238042	238052	238029	238029	you	10100	” said the Captain , holding up his hook , “
238057	238058	238029	238029	you	10100	” “
238076	238086	238066	238066	you	10100	” returned the Manager , with the same frankness ; “
238155	238513	238119	238121	my good Captain	14315	” said Mr Carker , nodding his head . Captain Cuttle , looking at him steadily ( Mr Carker looked full as steadily at the Captain ) , went out of the office and left him standing astride before the fire , as calm and pleasant as if there were no more spots upon his soul than on his pure white linen , and his smooth sleek skin . The Captain glanced , in passing through the outer counting - house , at the desk where he knew poor Walter had been used to sit , now occupied by another young boy , with a face almost as fresh and hopeful as his on the day when they tapped the famous last bottle but one of the old Madeira , in the little back parlour . The nation of ideas , thus awakened , did the Captain a great deal of good ; it softened him in the very height of his anger , and brought the tears into his eyes . Arrived at the wooden Midshipman ’s again , and sitting down in a corner of the dark shop , the Captain ’s indignation , strong as it was , could make no head against his grief . Passion seemed not only to do wrong and violence to the memory of the dead , but to be infected by death , and to droop and decline beside it . All the living knaves and liars in the world , were nothing to the honesty and truth of one dead friend . The only thing the honest Captain made out clearly , in this state of mind , besides the loss of Walter , was , that with him almost the whole world of Captain Cuttle had been drowned . If he reproached himself sometimes , and keenly too , for having ever connived at Walter ’s innocent deceit , he thought at least as often of the Mr Carker whom no sea could ever render up ; and the Mr Dombey , whom he now began to perceive was as far beyond human recall ; and the “
238518	238864	238119	238121	my good Captain	14315	” with whom he must never foregather again ; and the Lovely Peg , that teak - built and trim ballad , that had gone ashore upon a rock , and split into mere planks and beams of rhyme . The Captain sat in the dark shop , thinking of these things , to the entire exclusion of his own injury ; and looking with as sad an eye upon the ground , as if in contemplation of their actual fragments , as they floated past . But the Captain was not unmindful , for all that , of such decent and rest observances in memory of poor Walter , as he felt within his power . Rousing himself , and rousing Rob the Grinder ( who in the unnatural twilight was fast asleep ) , the Captain sallied forth with his attendant at his heels , and the door - key in his pocket , and repairing to one of those convenient slop - selling establishments of which there is abundant choice at the eastern end of London , purchased on the spot two suits of mourning — one for Rob the Grinder , which was immensely too small , and one for himself , which was immensely too large . He also provided Rob with a species of hat , greatly to be admired for its symmetry and usefulness , as well as for a happy blending of the mariner with the coal - heaver ; which is usually termed a sou’wester ; and which was something of a novelty in connexion with the instrument business . In their several garments , which the vendor declared to be such a miracle in point of fit as nothing but a rare combination of fortuitous circumstances ever brought about , and the fashion of which was unparalleled within the memory of the oldest inhabitant , the Captain and Grinder immediately arrayed themselves : presenting a spectacle fraught with wonder to all who beheld it . In this altered form , the Captain received Mr Toots . “
238876	238881	238865	238865	I	0	” said the Captain , “
238915	238959	238960	238961	The Captain	392	more—“special , mind you , that is — though I will think of them , when night comes on a hurricane and seas is mountains rowling , for which overhaul your Doctor Watts , brother , and when found make a note on . ”
239798	239807	239809	239809	he	533	“ A most extraordinary accidental likeness , certainly , ”
239822	240224	240225	240225	She	5804	” ; perhaps some scornful Nymph — according as the Picture Dealers found the market , when they christened it . It is the figure of a woman , supremely handsome , who , turning away , but with her face addressed to the spectator , flashes her proud glance upon him . It is like Edith . With a passing gesture of his hand at the picture — what ! a menace ? No ; yet something like it . A wave as of triumph ? No ; yet more like that . An insolent salute wafted from his lips ? No ; yet like that too — he resumes his breakfast , and calls to the chafing and imprisoned bird , who coming down into a pendant gilded hoop within the cage , like a great wedding - ring , swings in it , for his delight . The second home is on the other side of London , near to where the busy great north road of bygone days is silent and almost deserted , except by wayfarers who toil along on foot . It is a poor small house , barely and sparely furnished , but very clean ; and there is even an attempt to decorate it , shown in the homely flowers trained about the porch and in the narrow garden . The neighbourhood in which it stands has as little of the country to recommend it , as it has of the town . It is neither of the town nor country . The former , like the giant in his travelling boots , has made a stride and passed it , and has set his brick - and - mortar heel a long way in advance ; but the intermediate space between the giant ’s feet , as yet , is only blighted country , and not town ; and , here , among a few tall chimneys belching smoke all day and night , and among the brick - fields and the lanes where turf is cut , and where the fences tumble down , and where the dusty nettles grow , and where a scrap or two of hedge may yet be seen , and where the bird - catcher still comes occasionally , though he swears every time to come no more — this second home is to be found . ”
240569	240576	240577	240577	she	9777	“ It is early , John , ”
240580	240588	240577	240577	she	9777	“ Why do you go so early ? ”
240589	240632	240548	240548	her	9777	“ Not many minutes earlier than usual , Harriet . If I have the time to spare , I should like , I think — it ’s a fancy — to walk once by the house where I took leave of him . ”
240633	240646	240548	240548	her	9777	“ I wish I had ever seen or known him , John . ”
240647	240662	240577	240577	she	9777	“ It is better as it is , my dear , remembering his fate . ”
240663	240712	240548	240548	her	9777	“ But I could not regret it more , though I had known him . Is not your sorrow mine ? And if I had , perhaps you would feel that I was a better companion to you in speaking about him , than I may seem now . ”
240713	240739	240548	240548	her	9777	“ My dearest sister ! Is there anything within the range of rejoicing or regret , in which I am not sure of your companionship ? ”
240740	240755	240548	240548	her	9777	“ I hope you think not , John , for surely there is nothing ! ”
240756	240780	240782	240783	her brother	9768	“ How could you be better to me , or nearer to me then , than you are in this , or anything ? ”
240785	240805	240782	240783	her brother	9768	“ I feel that you did know him , Harriet , and that you shared my feelings towards him . ”
240829	240835	240806	240806	She	5817	“ No , not quite . ”
240836	240841	240842	240842	he	9768	“ True , true ! ”
240845	240865	240842	240842	he	9768	“ you think I might have done him no harm if I had allowed myself to know him better ? ”
240866	240873	240806	240806	She	5817	“ Think ! I know it . ”
240874	240883	240884	240884	he	9768	“ Designedly , Heaven knows I would not , ”
240892	240919	240888	240888	his	9768	“ but his reputation was too precious to be perilled by such association . Whether you share that knowledge , or do not , my dear — ”
240920	240925	240926	240926	she	5817	“ I do not , ”
240930	240959	240960	240960	He	9768	“ It is still the truth , Harriet , and my mind is lighter when I think of him for that which made it so much heavier then . ”
240976	240981	240962	240962	himself	9768	“ Good - bye ! ”
240982	241016	240974	240974	he	9768	“ Good - bye , dear John ! In the evening , at the old time and place , I shall meet you as usual on your way home . Good - bye . ”
241636	241644	241645	241645	she	445	“ You are come again , Sir ! ”
241650	241656	241657	241657	he	12434	“ I take that liberty , ”
241660	241671	241657	241657	he	12434	“ May I ask for five minutes of your leisure ? ”
241730	241782	241783	241783	he	2410	“ Miss Harriet , you can not be proud . You signified to me , when I called t’other morning , that you were . Pardon me if I say that I looked into your face while you spoke , and that it contradicted you . I look into it again , ”
241798	241807	241783	241783	he	2410	“ and it contradicts you more and more . ”
241822	241830	241832	241833	her visitor	5844	“ It is the mirror of truth , ”
241835	241848	241849	241849	His	2410	“ and gentleness . Excuse my trusting to it , and returning . ”
241896	241903	241905	241906	the gentleman	2410	“ The disparity between our ages , ”
241908	241945	241905	241906	the gentleman	2410	“ and the plainness of my purpose , empower me , I am glad to think , to speak my mind . That is my mind ; and so you see me for the second time . ”
241946	241956	241957	241957	she	445	“ There is a kind of pride , Sir , ”
241966	241988	241957	241957	she	445	“ or what may be supposed to be pride , which is mere duty . I hope I cherish no other . ”
241989	241993	241994	241994	he	2410	“ For yourself , ”
241997	242001	241994	241994	he	2410	“ For myself . ”
242002	242008	242010	242011	the gentleman	2410	“ But — pardon me — ”
242013	242019	241994	241994	he	2410	“ For your brother John ? ”
242020	242029	242031	242031	Harriet	443	“ Proud of his love , I am , ”
242080	242109	242072	242072	her	443	“ and proud of him . Sir , you who strangely know the story of his life , and repeated it to me when you were here last — ”
242110	242120	242122	242123	the gentleman	2410	“ Merely to make my way into your confidence , ”
242125	242135	242122	242123	the gentleman	2410	“ For heaven ’s sake , do n’t suppose — ”
242136	242141	242142	242142	she	443	“ I am sure , ”
242145	242168	242142	242142	she	443	“ you revived it , in my hearing , with a kind and good purpose . I am quite sure of it . ”
242169	242174	242176	242177	her visitor	5844	“ I thank you , ”
242184	242220	242176	242177	her visitor	5844	“ I am much obliged to you . You do me justice , I assure you . You were going to say , that I , who know the story of John Carker ’s life — ”
242221	242229	242230	242230	she	443	“ May think it pride in me , ”
242233	242379	242230	242230	she	443	“ when I say that I am proud of him ! I am . You know the time was , when I was not — when I could not be — but that is past . The humility of many years , the uncomplaining expiation , the true repentance , the terrible regret , the pain I know he has even in my affection , which he thinks has cost me dear , though Heaven knows I am happy , but for his sorrow I — oh , Sir , after what I have seen , let me conjure you , if you are in any place of power , and are ever wronged , never , for any wrong , inflict a punishment that can not be recalled ; while there is a GOD above us to work changes in the hearts He made . ”
242380	242388	242390	242391	the gentleman	2410	“ Your brother is an altered man , ”
242395	242405	242390	242391	the gentleman	2410	“ I assure you I do n’t doubt it . ”
242406	242417	242419	242419	Harriet	443	“ He was an altered man when he did wrong , ”
242421	242441	242419	242419	Harriet	443	“ He is an altered man again , and is his true self now , believe me , Sir . ”
242442	242448	242463	242463	his	2410	“ But we go on , ”
242474	242558	242560	242561	the gentleman	2410	“ we go on in our clockwork routine , from day to day , and ca n’t make out , or follow , these changes . They — they’re a metaphysical sort of thing . We — we have n’t leisure for it . We — we have n’t courage . They ’re not taught at schools or colleges , and we do n’t know how to set about it . In short , we are so d —— d business - like , ”
242585	242590	242592	242593	the gentleman	2410	“ I am sure , ”
242608	242770	242592	242593	the gentleman	2410	“ I have good reason to believe that a jog - trot life , the same from day to day , would reconcile one to anything . One do n’t see anything , one do n’t hear anything , one do n’t know anything ; that ’s the fact . We go on taking everything for granted , and so we go on , until whatever we do , good , bad , or indifferent , we do from habit . Habit is all I shall have to report , when I am called upon to plead to my conscience , on my death - bed . ‘ Habit , ’ says I ; ‘ I was deaf , dumb , blind , and paralytic , to a million things , from habit . ’ ‘ Very business - like indeed , Mr What’s - your - name , ’ says Conscience , ‘ but it wo n’t do here ! ’ ”
242795	242799	242800	242800	he	2410	“ Miss Harriet , ”
242807	242840	242800	242800	he	2410	“ I wish you would let me serve you . Look at me ; I ought to look honest , for I know I am so , at present . Do I ? ”
242841	242844	242845	242845	she	5855	“ Yes , ”
242851	242860	242861	242861	he	2410	“ I believe every word you have said , ”
242864	242963	242800	242800	he	2410	“ I am full of self - reproach that I might have known this and seen this , and known you and seen you , any time these dozen years , and that I never have . I hardly know how I ever got here — creature that I am , not only of my own habit , but of other people ’s ! But having done so , let me do something . I ask it in all honour and respect . You inspire me with both , in the highest degree . Let me do something . ”
242964	242971	242800	242800	he	2410	“ We are contented , Sir . ”
242972	242980	242982	242983	the gentleman	2410	“ No , no , not quite , ”
242985	243008	243009	243009	he	2410	“ I think not quite . There are some little comforts that might smooth your life , and his . And his ! ”
243021	243075	243077	243078	the visitor	12215	“ I have been in the habit of thinking that there was nothing wanting to be done for him ; that it was all settled and over ; in short , of not thinking at all about it . I am different now . Let me do something for him . You too , ”
243084	243103	243077	243078	the visitor	12215	“ have need to watch your health closely , for his sake , and I fear it fails . ”
243104	243112	243114	243114	Harriet	443	“ Whoever you may be , Sir , ”
243123	243247	243117	243117	her	443	“ I am deeply grateful to you . I feel certain that in all you say , you have no object in the world but kindness to us . But years have passed since we began this life ; and to take from my brother any part of what has so endeared him to me , and so proved his better resolution — any fragment of the merit of his unassisted , obscure , and forgotten reparation — would be to diminish the comfort it will be to him and me , when that time comes to each of us , of which you spoke just now . I thank you better with these tears than any words . Believe it , pray . ”
243283	243291	243293	243293	Harriet	443	“ If the day should ever come , ”
243295	243310	243293	243293	Harriet	443	“ when he is restored , in part , to the position he lost — ”
243311	243314	243316	243317	the gentleman	2410	“ Restored ! ”
243321	243375	243316	243317	the gentleman	2410	“ How can that be hoped for ? In whose hands does the power of any restoration lie ? It is no mistake of mine , surely , to suppose that his having gained the priceless blessing of his life , is one cause of the animosity shown to him by his brother . ”
243376	243394	243396	243396	Harriet	443	“ You touch upon a subject that is never breathed between us ; not even between us , ”
243398	243404	243406	243407	the visitor	12215	“ I beg your forgiveness , ”
243409	243464	243466	243467	the gentleman	2410	“ I should have known it . I entreat you to forget that I have done so , inadvertently . And now , as I dare urge no more — as I am not sure that I have a right to do so — though Heaven knows , even that doubt may be habit , ”
243478	243494	243466	243467	the gentleman	2410	“ let me ; though a stranger , yet no stranger ; ask two favours . ”
243495	243500	243501	243501	she	443	“ What are they ? ”
243504	243548	243501	243501	she	443	“ The first , that if you should see cause to change your resolution , you will suffer me to be as your right hand . My name shall then be at your service ; it is useless now , and always insignificant . ”
243549	243555	243556	243556	she	443	“ Our choice of friends , ”
243562	243581	243556	243556	she	443	“ is not so great , that I need any time for consideration . I can promise that . ”
243582	243610	243612	243613	the gentleman	2410	“ The second , that you will allow me sometimes , say every Monday morning , at nine o’clock — habit again — I must be businesslike , ”
243627	243727	243612	243613	the gentleman	2410	“ in walking past , to see you at the door or window . I do n’t ask to come in , as your brother will be gone out at that hour . I do n’t ask to speak to you . I merely ask to see , for the satisfaction of my own mind , that you are well , and without intrusion to remind you , by the sight of me , that you have a friend — an elderly friend , grey - haired already , and fast growing greyer — whom you may ever command . ”
243743	243750	243752	243753	the gentleman	2410	“ I understand , as before , ”
243757	243806	243808	243809	the gentleman	2410	“ that you purpose not to mention my visit to John Carker , lest he should be at all distressed by my acquaintance with his history . I am glad of it , for it is out of the ordinary course of things , and — habit again ! ”
243815	243828	243808	243809	the gentleman	2410	“ as if there were no better course than the ordinary course ! ”
244792	244801	244803	244803	Harriet	445	“ Why do you rest in the rain ? ”
244807	244817	244803	244803	Harriet	445	“ Because I have no other resting - place , ”
244822	244835	244803	244803	Harriet	445	“ But there are many places of shelter near here . This , ”
244842	244858	244803	244803	Harriet	445	“ is better than where you were . You are very welcome to rest here . ”
244929	244942	244943	244943	she	445	“ Why , what ’s a torn foot to such as me ? ”
244946	244963	244943	244943	she	445	“ And what ’s a torn foot in such as me , to such as you ? ”
244964	244971	244973	244973	Harriet	445	“ Come in and wash it , ”
244977	244989	244973	244973	Harriet	445	“ and let me give you something to bind it up . ”
245187	245194	245195	245195	she	445	“ I daresay you are thinking , ”
245203	245226	245195	245195	she	445	“ that I used to be handsome , once . I believe I was — I know I was — Look here ! ”
245268	245277	245279	245279	Harriet	445	“ Are you a stranger in this place ? ”
245281	245285	245286	245286	she	445	“ A stranger ! ”
245301	245344	245286	245286	she	445	“ Yes . Ten or a dozen years a stranger . I have had no almanack where I have been . Ten or a dozen years . I do n’t know this part . It ’s much altered since I went away . ”
245345	245351	245377	245377	she	445	“ Have you been far ? ”
245352	245376	245377	245377	she	445	“ Very far . Months upon months over the sea , and far away even then . I have been where convicts go , ”
245386	245393	245377	245377	she	445	“ I have been one myself . ”
245394	245402	245377	245377	she	445	“ Heaven help you and forgive you ! ”
245408	245418	245419	245419	she	445	“ Ah ! Heaven help me and forgive me ! ”
245429	245450	245419	245419	she	445	“ If man would help some of us a little more , God would forgive us all the sooner perhaps . ”
245483	245515	245516	245516	She	445	“ We may be about the same age , you and me . If I am older , it is not above a year or two . Oh think of that ! ”
245550	245569	245571	245571	Harriet	445	“ There is nothing we may not hope to repair ; it is never too late to amend , ”
245573	245578	245571	245571	Harriet	445	“ You are penitent ? ”
245579	245582	245583	245583	she	445	“ No , ”
245586	245636	245637	245637	She	445	“ I am not ! I ca n’t be . I am no such thing . Why should I be penitent , and all the world go free ? They talk to me of my penitence . Who ’s penitent for the wrongs that have been done to me ? ”
245654	245660	245662	245662	Harriet	445	“ Where are you going ? ”
245664	245667	245668	245668	she	445	“ Yonder , ”
245676	245680	245668	245668	she	445	“ To London . ”
245681	245690	245668	245668	she	445	“ Have you any home to go to ? ”
245691	245713	245714	245714	she	445	“ I think I have a mother . She ’s as much a mother , as her dwelling is a home , ”
245721	245725	245727	245727	Harriet	445	“ Take this , ”
245735	245757	245727	245727	Harriet	445	“ Try to do well . It is very little , but for one day it may keep you from harm . ”
245758	245763	245765	245766	the other	10537	“ Are you married ? ”
245775	245799	245765	245766	the other	10537	“ No . I live here with my brother . We have not much to spare , or I would give you more . ”
245800	245808	245842	245842	she	445	“ Will you let me kiss you ? ”
246411	246416	246417	246417	she	10432	“ Who ’s that ? ”
246425	246442	246417	246417	she	10432	“ One who brings you news , was the answer , in a woman ’s voice . “
246448	246449	246417	246417	she	10432	” “
246453	246454	246417	246417	she	10432	” “
246459	246468	246417	246417	she	10432	” cried the old woman , starting up . “
246475	246571	246417	246417	she	10432	” The old woman raked the fire together , hurriedly , and going close to her visitor who had entered , and shut the door , and who now stood in the middle of the room , put her hand upon the drenched cloak , and turned the unresisting figure , so as to have it in the full light of the fire . She did not find what she had expected , whatever that might be ; for she let the cloak go again , and uttered a querulous cry of disappointment and misery . “
246577	246582	246417	246417	she	10432	” asked her visitor . “
246587	246603	246417	246417	she	10432	” cried the old woman , turning her face upward , with a terrible howl . “
246609	246615	246417	246417	she	10432	” asked the visitor again . “
246622	246641	246417	246417	she	10432	” cried the old woman , tossing up her arms , and clasping her hands above her head . “
246661	246662	246653	246653	They	5930	” “
246679	246684	246677	246677	Marwood	536	” said the visitor . “
246693	246699	246686	246686	you	0	” cried the old woman . “
246706	246707	246708	246708	She	536	” “
246715	246720	246708	246708	She	536	” returned the other . “
246726	246736	246708	246708	She	536	” exclaimed the old woman , wringing her hands . “
246743	246870	246871	246871	She	5933	” said the other , looking round the room . The old woman , mumbling and shaking her head , and muttering to herself about her handsome daughter , brought a candle from a cupboard in the corner , and thrusting it into the fire with a trembling hand , lighted it with some difficulty and set it on the table . Its dirty wick burnt dimly at first , being choked in its own grease ; and when the bleared eyes and failing sight of the old woman could distinguish anything by its light , her visitor was sitting with her arms folded , her eyes turned downwards , and a handkerchief she had worn upon her head lying on the table by her side . “
246886	246898	246901	246901	she	5933	” mumbled the old woman , after waiting for some moments . “
246904	246905	246901	246901	she	5933	” “
246908	246947	246948	246948	Alice	536	” returned the visitor . The old woman repeated the word in a scared uncertain way ; and , shading her eyes , looked at the speaker , round the room , and at the speaker once again . “
246955	247022	246953	246953	mother	12864	” and the speaker fixed her eyes upon her . Again the old woman looked round the room , and at her visitor , and round the room once more . Hastily seizing the candle , and rising from her seat , she held it to the visitor ’s face , uttered a loud cry , set down the light , and fell upon her neck ! “
247044	247064	247067	247068	my gal	5927	” screamed the old woman , rocking herself to and fro upon the breast that coldly suffered her embrace . “
247086	247126	247129	247129	mother	12864	” she screamed again , dropping on the floor before her , clasping her knees , laying her head against them , and still rocking herself to and fro with every frantic demonstration of which her vitality was capable . “
247131	247159	247129	247129	mother	12864	” returned Alice , stooping forward for a moment and kissing her , but endeavouring , even in the act , to disengage herself from her embrace . “
247190	247191	247192	247192	She	536	” “
247201	247219	247220	247220	She	536	” cried the mother , looking up in her face , and still holding to her knees . “
247241	247242	247220	247220	She	536	” “
247247	247263	247245	247245	mother	12864	” said Alice , shaking her ragged skirts to detach the old woman from them : “
247300	247441	247443	247443	you	12864	” Her mother rose , and cried , and wrung her hands , and stood at a little distance gazing on her . Then she took the candle again , and going round her , surveyed her from head to foot , making a low moaning all the time . Then she put the candle down , resumed her chair , and beating her hands together to a kind of weary tune , and rolling herself from side to side , continued moaning and wailing to herself . Alice got up , took off her wet cloak , and laid it aside . That done , she sat down as before , and with her arms folded , and her eyes gazing at the fire , remained silently listening with a contemptuous face to her old mother ’s inarticulate complainings . “
247458	247472	247443	247443	you	12864	” she said at length , turning her eyes upon the old woman . “
247498	247499	247443	247443	you	12864	” “
247505	247510	247443	247443	you	12864	” cried the mother . “
247515	247516	247511	247511	She	12864	” “
247522	247527	247511	247511	She	12864	” returned the daughter . “
247551	247552	247538	247538	mother	12864	” “
247556	247561	247566	247566	she	12864	” exclaimed the mother . “
247580	247581	247566	247566	she	12864	” “
247604	247608	247586	247586	mother	12864	” said Alice . “
247627	247628	247624	247624	you	12864	” “
247639	247644	247634	247634	her	12864	” cried the old woman “
247663	247698	247656	247659	my own dear mother	5950	” she returned , sitting with her folded arms , and knitted brows , and compressed lips as if she were bent on excluding , by force , every softer feeling from her breast . “
247765	247766	247758	247758	you	12864	” “
247769	247775	247758	247758	you	12864	” cried the old woman . “
247788	247789	247784	247784	her	2403	” “
247798	247818	247784	247784	her	2403	” returned the daughter , looking coldly on her with her stern , regardless , hardy , beautiful face ; “
247889	247924	247927	247931	a child called Alice Marwood	5961	” Her mother sat mowing , and mumbling , and shaking her head , but whether angrily or remorsefully , or in denial , or only in her physical infirmity , did not appear . “
247933	247953	247984	247984	Nobody	795	” said the daughter , with a laugh , and looking down at herself in terrible derision of herself , “
247982	247983	247984	247984	Nobody	795	” “
247986	248000	247984	247984	Nobody	795	” echoed the mother , pointing to herself , and striking her breast . “
248007	248012	247984	247984	Nobody	795	” returned the daughter , “
248086	248087	248073	248073	She	5961	” “
248094	248099	248073	248073	She	5961	” exclaimed the mother . “
248105	248110	248100	248100	I	0	” returned the daughter . “
248191	248192	248185	248185	she	5969	” “
248198	248204	248205	248205	My	0	” whined the old woman . “
248211	248212	248213	248213	She	5961	” “
248219	248224	248213	248213	She	5961	” said the daughter . “
248354	248379	248340	248340	I	0	” She folded her arms tightly on her breast , and laughed in a tone that made the howl of the old woman musical . “
248388	248392	248386	248386	mother	12864	” she pursued , “
248525	248560	248567	248567	mother	12864	” The old woman leaned her elbows on the table , and resting her face upon her two hands , made a show of being in great distress — or really was , perhaps . “
248569	248589	248590	248590	I	0	” said the daughter , with a motion of her head , as if in dismissal of the subject . “
248693	248936	248684	248684	We	5992	” Lost and degraded as she was , there was a beauty in her , both of face and form , which , even in its worst expression , could not but be recognised as such by anyone regarding her with the least attention . As she subsided into silence , and her face which had been harshly agitated , quieted down ; while her dark eyes , fixed upon the fire , exchanged the reckless light that had animated them , for one that was softened by something like sorrow ; there shone through all her wayworn misery and fatigue , a ray of the departed radiance of the fallen angel . Her mother , after watching her for some time without speaking , ventured to steal her withered hand a little nearer to her across the table ; and finding that she permitted this , to touch her face , and smooth her hair . With the feeling , as it seemed , that the old woman was at least sincere in this show of interest , Alice made no movement to check her ; so , advancing by degrees , she bound up her daughter ’s hair afresh , took off her wet shoes , if they deserved the name , spread something dry upon her shoulders , and hovered humbly about her , muttering to herself , as she recognised her old features and expression more and more . “
248947	248963	248942	248942	mother	12864	” said Alice , looking round , when she had sat thus for some time . “
248970	249075	248942	248942	mother	12864	” replied the old woman . She admired her daughter , and was afraid of her . Perhaps her admiration , such as it was , had originated long ago , when she first found anything that was beautiful appearing in the midst of the squalid fight of her existence . Perhaps her fear was referable , in some sort , to the retrospect she had so lately heard . Be this as it might , she stood , submissively and deferentially , before her child , and inclined her head , as if in a pitiful entreaty to be spared any further reproach . “
249081	249082	248942	248942	mother	12864	” “
249089	249095	248942	248942	mother	12864	“ And pilfering , mother ? ”
249096	249150	249176	249177	the mother	9821	“ Sometimes , Ally — in a very small way . I am old and timid . I have taken trifles from children now and then , my deary , but not often . I have tramped about the country , pet , and I know what I know . I have watched . ”
249151	249154	249156	249157	the daughter	11069	“ Watched ? ”
249163	249174	249176	249177	the mother	9821	“ I have hung about a family , my deary , ”
249187	249191	249176	249177	the mother	9821	“ What family ? ”
249192	249222	249223	249223	She	9821	“ Hush , darling . Do n’t be angry with me . I did it for the love of you . In memory of my poor gal beyond seas . ”
249242	249249	249250	249250	she	9821	“ Years ago , my deary , ”
249265	249276	249250	249250	she	9821	“ I came across his little child , by chance . ”
249277	249281	249226	249226	her	9821	“ Whose child ? ”
249282	249312	249250	249250	she	9821	“ Not his , Alice deary ; do n’t look at me like that ; not his . How could it be his ? You know he has none . ”
249313	249317	249319	249320	the daughter	11069	“ Whose then ? ”
249322	249327	249319	249320	the daughter	11069	“ You said his . ”
249328	249365	249250	249250	she	9821	“ Hush , Ally ; you frighten me , deary . Mr Dombey’s — only Mr Dombey ’s . Since then , darling , I have seen them often . I have seen _ him _ . ”
249461	249469	249471	249473	the old woman	10432	“ Little he thought who I was ! ”
249480	249486	249492	249492	her	2433	“ And little he cared ! ”
249495	249506	249492	249492	her	2433	“ But there we were , said the old woman , “
249552	249553	249545	249545	I	0	” “
249562	249568	249545	249545	I	0	” returned the daughter disdainfully . “
249575	249659	249545	249545	I	0	” said the mother . She held her peace ; for the face and form before her were unshaped by rage . It seemed as if the bosom would burst with the emotions that strove within it . The effort that constrained and held it pent up , was no less formidable than the rage itself : no less bespeaking the violent and dangerous character of the woman who made it . But it succeeded , and she asked , after a silence : “
249664	249665	249545	249545	I	0	” “
249670	249675	249545	249545	I	0	” said the mother . “
249680	249681	249688	249688	deary	14531	” “
249713	249729	249706	249706	We	6016	” cried the old woman , hugging herself with her lean arms in her exultation . “
249744	249754	249742	249742	me	0	” The daughter looked at her for an explanation . “
249766	249777	249756	249756	you	14531	” said the old woman , hobbling to the cupboard ; “
249785	249800	249756	249756	you	14531	little”—diving down into her pocket , and jingling a few half — pence on the table—“little
249812	249869	249808	249808	Alice	536	” The covetous , sharp , eager face , with which she asked the question and looked on , as her daughter took out of her bosom the little gift she had so lately received , told almost as much of the history of this parent and child as the child herself had told in words . “
249874	249879	249880	249880	I	0	” said the mother . “
249895	249896	249885	249885	I	0	” “
249905	249940	249903	249903	deary	14531	” said the old woman , bending greedily over the table to look at the money , which she appeared distrustful of her daughter ’s still retaining in her hand , and gazing on . “
249973	250042	249963	249963	I	0	” With greater alacrity than might have been expected in one of her appearance — for age and misery seemed to have made her as decrepit as ugly — she began to occupy her trembling hands in tying an old bonnet on her head , and folding a torn shawl about herself : still eyeing the money in her daughter ’s hand , with the same sharp desire . “
250056	250061	250054	250054	mother	12864	” asked the daughter . “
250069	250070	250054	250054	mother	12864	” “
250074	250085	250054	250054	mother	12864	” she replied , attiring herself , with fumbling fingers , “
250123	250124	250121	250121	Alice	536	” “
250128	250129	250130	250130	I	0	” “
250144	250149	250151	250151	some	10133	” chuckled the mother . “
250171	250209	250163	250164	My gal	5927	” Then , seeing that in the wondering earnestness with which her daughter regarded her , her hand involuntarily closed upon the money , the old woman made more speed to secure it , and hurriedly added , “
250223	250255	250258	250258	Ally	536	” As she stood with her hand stretched out before her daughter , her daughter , glancing again at the money , put it to her lips before parting with it . “
250265	250271	250261	250261	you	536	” chuckled the old woman . “
250290	250304	250261	250261	you	536	” squeezing her own tarnished halfpence up to her bag of a throat , “
250317	250318	250319	250319	I	0	” “
250325	250330	250323	250323	mother	12864	” said the daughter , “
250352	250353	250354	250355	The giver	6029	” “
250361	250376	250354	250355	The giver	6029	” retorted the old woman , whose dimmed eyes glistened as she took it . “
250415	250416	250409	250409	I	0	” “
250429	250443	250421	250421	you	12864	” said the daughter , following her to the door with her eyes . “
250453	250454	250444	250444	You	12864	” “
250457	250470	250471	250471	I	0	” croaked the old woman , coming back a step or two , “
250499	250505	250495	250495	I	0	” The daughter smiled incredulously . “
250514	250532	250512	250512	Alice	536	” said the old woman , stretching out her neck with a leer of malice absolutely frightful , “
250564	250565	250550	250551	his sister	9777	” “
250568	250569	250550	250551	his sister	9777	” “
250609	250628	250599	250599	his	6037	” cried the old woman , shaking her head and laughing ; for her daughter had started up , “
250672	250673	250667	250667	I	0	” “
250676	250694	250667	250667	I	0	” and the daughter flung herself upon her , with her former passion raging like a fire . “
250708	250721	250727	250727	him	6037	” The old woman , amazed and terrified , nodded her head . “
250751	250758	250775	250775	Deary	14531	” Again the old woman nodded . “
250771	250772	250773	250773	Alice	536	” “
250777	250778	250775	250775	Deary	14531	” “
250791	251048	250775	250775	Deary	14531	” She forced it from the old woman ’s hand as she spoke , and utterly indifferent to her complainings and entreaties , threw on the garments she had taken off , and hurried out , with headlong speed . The mother followed , limping after her as she could , and expostulating with no more effect upon her than upon the wind and rain and darkness that encompassed them . Obdurate and fierce in her own purpose , and indifferent to all besides , the daughter defied the weather and the distance , as if she had known no travel or fatigue , and made for the house where she had been relieved . After some quarter of an hour ’s walking , the old woman , spent and out of breath , ventured to hold by her skirts ; but she ventured no more , and they travelled on in silence through the wet and gloom . If the mother now and then uttered a word of complaint , she stifled it lest her daughter should break away from her and leave her behind ; and the daughter was dumb . It was within an hour or so of midnight , when they left the regular streets behind them , and entered on the deeper gloom of that neutral ground where the house was situated . The town lay in the distance , lurid and lowering ; the bleak wind howled over the open space ; all around was black , wild , desolate . “
251057	251067	251068	251068	I	0	” said the daughter , stopping to look back . “
251080	251081	251082	251082	Alice	536	” “
251087	251099	251100	251100	Alice	536	” cried the mother , pulling her gently by the skirt . “
251102	251103	251107	251107	mother	12864	” “
251109	251110	251107	251107	mother	12864	” “
251155	251156	251147	251147	you	14531	” “
251160	251168	251147	251147	you	14531	” was all the daughter ’s answer . “
251180	251254	251255	251255	I	0	” The old woman nodded in the affirmative ; and a few more paces brought them to the threshold . There was the light of fire and candle in the room where Alice had sat to dry her clothes ; and on her knocking at the door , John Carker appeared from that room . He was surprised to see such visitors at such an hour , and asked Alice what she wanted . “
251260	251264	251255	251255	I	0	” she said . “
251273	251286	251265	251271	The woman who gave me money today	6061	” At the sound of her raised voice , Harriet came out . “
251289	251293	251265	251271	The woman who gave me money today	6061	” said Alice . “
251303	251304	251299	251299	you	14531	” “
251307	251371	251299	251299	you	14531	” she answered , wondering . The face that had humbled itself before her , looked on her now with such invincible hatred and defiance ; and the hand that had gently touched her arm , was clenched with such a show of evil purpose , as if it would gladly strangle her ; that she drew close to her brother for protection . “
251409	251418	251421	251421	you	14531	” said Alice , with a menacing gesture . “
251429	251430	251426	251426	I	0	” “
251433	251438	251439	251439	You	14531	” returned the other . “
251471	251518	251463	251463	You	14531	” The old woman , with a malevolence that made her ugliness quite awful , shook her withered hand at the brother and sister in confirmation of her daughter , but plucked her by the skirts again , nevertheless , imploring her to keep the money . “
251589	251612	251613	251613	I	0	” As she said the words , she threw the money down upon the ground , and spurned it with her foot . “
251656	251675	251633	251633	I	0	” Harriet , pale and trembling , restrained her brother , and suffered her to go on uninterrupted . “
251741	252600	251725	251725	I	0	” With a fierce action of her hand , as if she sprinkled hatred on the ground , and with it devoted those who were standing there to destruction , she looked up once at the black sky , and strode out into the wild night . The mother , who had plucked at her skirts again and again in vain , and had eyed the money lying on the threshold with an absorbing greed that seemed to concentrate her faculties upon it , would have prowled about , until the house was dark , and then groped in the mire on the chance of repossessing herself of it . But the daughter drew her away , and they set forth , straight , on their return to their dwelling ; the old woman whimpering and bemoaning their loss upon the road , and fretfully bewailing , as openly as she dared , the undutiful conduct of her handsome girl in depriving her of a supper , on the very first night of their reunion . Supperless to bed she went , saving for a few coarse fragments ; and those she sat mumbling and munching over a scrap of fire , long after her undutiful daughter lay asleep . Were this miserable mother , and this miserable daughter , only the reduction to their lowest grade , of certain social vices sometimes prevailing higher up ? In this round world of many circles within circles , do we make a weary journey from the high grade to the low , to find at last that they lie close together , that the two extremes touch , and that our journey ’s end is but our starting - place ? Allowing for great difference of stuff and texture , was the pattern of this woof repeated among gentle blood at all ? Say , Edith Dombey ! And Cleopatra , best of mothers , let us have your testimony ! CHAPTER XXXV . The Happy Pair The dark blot on the street is gone . Mr Dombey ’s mansion , if it be a gap among the other houses any longer , is only so because it is not to be vied with in its brightness , and haughtily casts them off . The saying is , that home is home , be it never so homely . If it hold good in the opposite contingency , and home is home be it never so stately , what an altar to the Household Gods is raised up here ! Lights are sparkling in the windows this evening , and the ruddy glow of fires is warm and bright upon the hangings and soft carpets , and the dinner waits to be served , and the dinner - table is handsomely set forth , though only for four persons , and the side board is cumbrous with plate . It is the first time that the house has been arranged for occupation since its late changes , and the happy pair are looked for every minute . Only second to the wedding morning , in the interest and expectation it engenders among the household , is this evening of the coming home . Mrs Perch is in the kitchen taking tea ; and has made the tour of the establishment , and priced the silks and damasks by the yard , and exhausted every interjection in the dictionary and out of it expressive of admiration and wonder . The upholsterer ’s foreman , who has left his hat , with a pocket - handkerchief in it , both smelling strongly of varnish , under a chair in the hall , lurks about the house , gazing upwards at the cornices , and downward at the carpets , and occasionally , in a silent transport of enjoyment , taking a rule out of his pocket , and skirmishingly measuring expensive objects , with unutterable feelings . Cook is in high spirits , and says give her a place where there ’s plenty of company ( as she ’ll bet you sixpence there will be now ) , for she is of a lively disposition , and she always was from a child , and she do n’t mind who knows it ; which sentiment elicits from the breast of Mrs Perch a responsive murmur of support and approbation . All the housemaid hopes is , happiness for ’em — but marriage is a lottery , and the more she thinks about it , the more she feels the independence and the safety of a single life . Mr Towlinson is saturnine and grim , and says that ’s his opinion too , and give him War besides , and down with the French — for this young man has a general impression that every foreigner is a Frenchman , and must be by the laws of nature . At each new sound of wheels , they all stop , whatever they are saying , and listen ; and more than once there is a general starting up and a cry of “
252605	252845	252602	252602	they	6065	” But here they are not yet ; and Cook begins to mourn over the dinner , which has been put back twice , and the upholsterer ’s foreman still goes lurking about the rooms , undisturbed in his blissful reverie ! Florence is ready to receive her father and her new Mama . Whether the emotions that are throbbing in her breast originate in pleasure or in pain , she hardly knows . But the fluttering heart sends added colour to her cheeks , and brightness to her eyes ; and they say downstairs , drawing their heads together — for they always speak softly when they speak of her — how beautiful Miss Florence looks tonight , and what a sweet young lady she has grown , poor dear ! A pause succeeds ; and then Cook , feeling , as president , that her sentiments are waited for , wonders whether — and there stops . The housemaid wonders too , and so does Mrs Perch , who has the happy social faculty of always wondering when other people wonder , without being at all particular what she wonders at . Mr Towlinson , who now descries an opportunity of bringing down the spirits of the ladies to his own level , says wait and see ; he wishes some people were well out of this . Cook leads a sigh then , and a murmur of “
252858	252871	252602	252602	they	6065	” and when it has gone round the table , adds persuasively , “
252887	252899	252885	252885	Tom	357	” Mr Towlinson ’s rejoinder , pregnant with frightful meaning , is “
252907	253204	252904	252904	she	197	” and sensible that a mere man can scarcely be more prophetic , or improve upon that , he holds his peace . Mrs Skewton , prepared to greet her darling daughter and dear son - in - law with open arms , is appropriately attired for that purpose in a very youthful costume , with short sleeves . At present , however , her ripe charms are blooming in the shade of her own apartments , whence she had not emerged since she took possession of them a few hours ago , and where she is fast growing fretful , on account of the postponement of dinner . The maid who ought to be a skeleton , but is in truth a buxom damsel , is , on the other hand , in a most amiable state : considering her quarterly stipend much safer than heretofore , and foreseeing a great improvement in her board and lodging . Where are the happy pair , for whom this brave home is waiting ? Do steam , tide , wind , and horses , all abate their speed , to linger on such happiness ? Does the swarm of loves and graces hovering about them retard their progress by its numbers ? Are there so many flowers in their happy path , that they can scarcely move along , without entanglement in thornless roses , and sweetest briar ? They are here at last ! The noise of wheels is heard , grows louder , and a carriage drives up to the door ! A thundering knock from the obnoxious foreigner anticipates the rush of Mr Towlinson and party to open it ; and Mr Dombey and his bride alight , and walk in arm in arm . “
253209	253218	253207	253207	Edith	481	” cries an agitated voice upon the stairs . “
253223	253303	253207	253207	Edith	481	” and the short sleeves wreath themselves about the happy couple in turn , and embrace them . Florence had come down to the hall too , but did not advance : reserving her timid welcome until these nearer and dearer transports should subside . But the eyes of Edith sought her out , upon the threshold ; and dismissing her sensitive parent with a slight kiss on the cheek , she hurried on to Florence and embraced her . “
253311	253451	253306	253306	you	481	” said Mr Dombey , putting out his hand . As Florence , trembling , raised it to her lips , she met his glance . The look was cold and distant enough , but it stirred her heart to think that she observed in it something more of interest than he had ever shown before . It even expressed a kind of faint surprise , and not a disagreeable surprise , at sight of her . She dared not raise her eyes to his any more ; but she felt that he looked at her once again , and not less favourably . Oh what a thrill of joy shot through her , awakened by even this intangible and baseless confirmation of her hope that she would learn to win him , through her new and beautiful Mama ! “
253465	253470	253459	253460	Mrs Dombey	186	” said Mr Dombey . “
253477	253478	253480	253480	them	6069	” “
253491	253581	253480	253480	them	6069	” With that Mr Dombey stalked away to his own dressing - room , and Mrs Dombey went upstairs to hers . Mrs Skewton and Florence repaired to the drawing - room , where that excellent mother considered it incumbent on her to shed a few irrepressible tears , supposed to be forced from her by her daughter ’s felicity ; and which she was still drying , very gingerly , with a laced corner of her pocket - handkerchief , when her son - in - law appeared . “
253599	253607	253590	253590	you	186	” she asked , subduing her emotion . “
253612	253617	253590	253590	you	186	” returned Mr Dombey . “
253622	253627	253590	253590	you	186	” said Mrs Skewton , “
253631	253640	253642	253643	Mr Dombey	533	“ Not particularly . I thought it dull , ”
253645	253652	253642	253643	Mr Dombey	533	“ Fie , my dearest Dombey ! ”
253655	253658	253642	253643	Mr Dombey	533	“ dull ! ”
253659	253669	253671	253672	Mr Dombey	533	“ It made that impression upon me , Madam , ”
253678	253699	253671	253672	Mr Dombey	533	“ I believe Mrs Dombey found it dull too . She mentioned once or twice that she thought it so . ”
253700	253707	253709	253710	Mrs Skewton	430	“ Why , you naughty girl ! ”
253721	253733	253713	253713	her	430	“ what dreadfully heretical things have you been saying about Paris ? ”
253781	253786	253788	253789	Mrs Skewton	430	“ My dear Dombey , ”
253791	253817	253788	253789	Mrs Skewton	430	“ how charmingly these people have carried out every idea that we hinted . They have made a perfect palace of the house , positively . ”
253818	253823	253825	253826	Mr Dombey	533	“ It is handsome , ”
253831	253855	253825	253826	Mr Dombey	533	“ I directed that no expense should be spared ; and all that money could do , has been done , I believe . ”
253856	253867	253869	253869	Cleopatra	432	“ And what can it not do , dear Dombey ? ”
253871	253878	253880	253881	Mr Dombey	533	“ It is powerful , Madam , ”
253900	253907	253883	253883	He	533	“ I hope , Mrs Dombey , ”
253920	253929	253883	253883	He	533	“ that these alterations meet with your approval ? ”
253930	253940	253941	253941	she	9766	“ They are as handsome as they can be , ”
253948	253963	253941	253941	she	9766	“ They should be so , of course . And I suppose they are . ”
254591	254604	254606	254606	Florence	197	“ I beg your pardon . Shall I go away , Papa ? ”
254614	254617	254625	254625	his	533	“ No , ”
254628	254649	254625	254625	his	533	“ you can come and go here , Florence , as you please . This is not my private room . ”
255394	255454	255390	255390	he	1111	“ By the death - beds I have tended , by the childhood I have suffered , by our meeting in this dreary house at midnight , by the cry wrung from me in the anguish of my heart , oh , father , turn to me and seek a refuge in my love before it is too late ! ”
255640	255646	255650	255650	his	1111	“ Florence , come here ! ”
255719	255724	255725	255725	she	197	“ Florence , dear , ”
255728	255737	255725	255725	she	197	“ I have been looking for you everywhere . ”
255822	255832	255835	255835	Edith	481	“ Softly , dear Mama . Papa is asleep . ”
255857	255868	255838	255838	She	481	“ I scarcely thought you could be here , Florence . ”
255881	255887	255889	255889	Edith	481	“ I left here early , ”
255891	255956	255889	255889	Edith	481	“ purposely to sit upstairs and talk with you . But , going to your room , I found my bird was flown , and I have been waiting there ever since , expecting its return . If it had been a bird , indeed , she could not have taken it more tenderly and gently to her breast , than she did Florence . “
255961	255962	255959	255959	dear	9979	” “
255978	255982	255986	255986	he	242	” hesitated Florence . “
255991	256353	255989	255989	Florence	197	” said Edith , looking full upon her . Florence drooped her head , and rose , and put up her work - basket . Edith drew her hand through her arm , and they went out of the room like sisters . Her very step was different and new to him , Mr Dombey thought , as his eyes followed her to the door . He sat in his shadowy corner so long , that the church clocks struck the hour three times before he moved that night . All that while his face was still intent upon the spot where Florence had been seated . The room grew darker , as the candles waned and went out ; but a darkness gathered on his face , exceeding any that the night could cast , and rested there . Florence and Edith , seated before the fire in the remote room where little Paul had died , talked together for a long time . Diogenes , who was of the party , had at first objected to the admission of Edith , and , even in deference to his mistress ’s wish , had only permitted it under growling protest . But , emerging by little and little from the ante - room , whither he had retired in dudgeon , he soon appeared to comprehend , that with the most amiable intentions he had made one of those mistakes which will occasionally arise in the best - regulated dogs ’ minds ; as a friendly apology for which he stuck himself up on end between the two , in a very hot place in front of the fire , and sat panting at it , with his tongue out , and a most imbecile expression of countenance , listening to the conversation . It turned , at first , on Florence ’s books and favourite pursuits , and on the manner in which she had beguiled the interval since the marriage . The last theme opened up to her a subject which lay very near her heart , and she said , with the tears starting to her eyes : “
256368	256369	256370	256370	You	212	” “
256377	256378	256375	256375	Florence	197	” “
256386	256428	256381	256382	Poor Walter	293	” Florence spread her hands before her face , and wept with all her heart . Many as were the secret tears which Walter ’s fate had cost her , they flowed yet , when she thought or spoke of him . “
256435	256442	256433	256433	dear	9979	” said Edith , soothing her . “
256453	256454	256449	256449	he	293	” “
256541	256542	256523	256523	Walter	293	” “
256551	256557	256545	256545	he	293	” inquired Edith , sternly . “
256576	256582	256567	256567	He	293	” said Florence , sobbing . “
256591	256595	256584	256584	he	293	” asked Edith . “
256613	256632	256610	256611	Dear Mama	212	” cried Florence , clinging to her as for help , and hiding her face upon her bosom , “
256640	256641	256636	256636	you	0	” “
256648	256671	256646	256646	Florence	197	” Edith turned so pale , and spoke so earnestly , that Florence did not need her restraining hand upon her lips . “
256687	256762	256646	256646	Florence	197	” Florence related it , and everything belonging to it , even down to the friendship of Mr Toots , of whom she could hardly speak in her distress without a tearful smile , although she was deeply grateful to him . When she had concluded her account , to the whole of which Edith , holding her hand , listened with close attention , and when a silence had succeeded , Edith said : “
256775	256776	256767	256767	you	197	” “
256782	256803	256767	256767	you	197	” said Florence , with the same mute appeal , and the same quick concealment of her face as before , “
256866	256990	256991	256991	Florence	197	” and clinging closer to her , with some broken fervent words of gratitude and endearment , Florence , relieved of her sad secret , wept long , but not as painfully as of yore , within the encircling arms of her new mother . Pale even to her lips , and with a face that strove for composure until its proud beauty was as fixed as death , Edith looked down upon the weeping girl , and once kissed her . Then gradually disengaging herself , and putting Florence away , she said , stately , and quiet as a marble image , and in a voice that deepened as she spoke , but had no other token of emotion in it : “
257008	257009	257024	257024	I	0	” “
257015	257022	257024	257024	I	0	” repeated Florence , in surprise . “
257039	257043	257045	257045	you	197	” said Edith . “
257090	257111	257112	257112	I	0	” She saw that Florence would have spoken here , so checked her with her hand , and went on . “
257213	257214	257215	257215	I	0	” “
257222	257226	257215	257215	I	0	” cried Florence . “
257238	257239	257215	257215	I	0	” “
257244	257257	257215	257215	I	0	” Edith seemed to repeat the words involuntarily , and went on . “
257331	257361	257295	257295	Florence	197	” Florence , without knowing why , felt almost afraid to hear her proceed , but kept her eyes riveted on the beautiful face so fixed upon her own . “
257369	257380	257295	257295	Florence	197	” said Edith , laying her hand upon her breast , “
257455	257492	257493	257493	I	0	” The tears that were visible in her eyes as she kept them fixed on Florence , showed that the composed face was but as a handsome mask ; but she preserved it , and continued : “
257582	257970	257976	257976	Floy	197	” She sat for some time silent ; Florence scarcely venturing to breathe meanwhile , as dim and imperfect shadows of the truth , and all its daily consequences , chased each other through her terrified , yet incredulous imagination . Almost as soon as she had ceased to speak , Edith ’s face began to subside from its set composure to that quieter and more relenting aspect , which it usually wore when she and Florence were alone together . She shaded it , after this change , with her hands ; and when she arose , and with an affectionate embrace bade Florence good - night , went quickly , and without looking round . But when Florence was in bed , and the room was dark except for the glow of the fire , Edith returned , and saying that she could not sleep , and that her dressing - room was lonely , drew a chair upon the hearth , and watched the embers as they died away . Florence watched them too from her bed , until they , and the noble figure before them , crowned with its flowing hair , and in its thoughtful eyes reflecting back their light , became confused and indistinct , and finally were lost in slumber . In her sleep , however , Florence could not lose an undefined impression of what had so recently passed . It formed the subject of her dreams , and haunted her ; now in one shape , now in another ; but always oppressively ; and with a sense of fear . She dreamed of seeking her father in wildernesses , of following his track up fearful heights , and down into deep mines and caverns ; of being charged with something that would release him from extraordinary suffering — she knew not what , or why — yet never being able to attain the goal and set him free . Then she saw him dead , upon that very bed , and in that very room , and knew that he had never loved her to the last , and fell upon his cold breast , passionately weeping . Then a prospect opened , and a river flowed , and a plaintive voice she knew , cried , “
257989	258098	257983	257983	You	197	” And she saw him at a distance stretching out his arms towards her , while a figure such as Walter ’s used to be , stood near him , awfully serene and still . In every vision , Edith came and went , sometimes to her joy , sometimes to her sorrow , until they were alone upon the brink of a dark grave , and Edith pointing down , she looked and saw — what!—another Edith lying at the bottom . In the terror of this dream , she cried out and awoke , she thought . A soft voice seemed to whisper in her ear , “
258111	259137	258101	258102	dear Florence	197	” and stretching out her arms , she returned the caress of her new Mama , who then went out at the door in the light of the grey morning . In a moment , Florence sat up wondering whether this had really taken place or not ; but she was only certain that it was grey morning indeed , and that the blackened ashes of the fire were on the hearth , and that she was alone . So passed the night on which the happy pair came home . CHAPTER XXXVI . Housewarming Many succeeding days passed in like manner ; except that there were numerous visits received and paid , and that Mrs Skewton held little levees in her own apartments , at which Major Bagstock was a frequent attendant , and that Florence encountered no second look from her father , although she saw him every day . Nor had she much communication in words with her new Mama , who was imperious and proud to all the house but her — Florence could not but observe that — and who , although she always sent for her or went to her when she came home from visiting , and would always go into her room at night , before retiring to rest , however late the hour , and never lost an opportunity of being with her , was often her silent and thoughtful companion for a long time together . Florence , who had hoped for so much from this marriage , could not help sometimes comparing the bright house with the faded dreary place out of which it had arisen , and wondering when , in any shape , it would begin to be a home ; for that it was no home then , for anyone , though everything went on luxuriously and regularly , she had always a secret misgiving . Many an hour of sorrowful reflection by day and night , and many a tear of blighted hope , Florence bestowed upon the assurance her new Mama had given her so strongly , that there was no one on the earth more powerless than herself to teach her how to win her father ’s heart . And soon Florence began to think — resolved to think would be the truer phrase — that as no one knew so well , how hopeless of being subdued or changed her father ’s coldness to her was , so she had given her this warning , and forbidden the subject in very compassion . Unselfish here , as in her every act and fancy , Florence preferred to bear the pain of this new wound , rather than encourage any faint foreshadowings of the truth as it concerned her father ; tender of him , even in her wandering thoughts . As for his home , she hoped it would become a better one , when its state of novelty and transition should be over ; and for herself , thought little and lamented less . If none of the new family were particularly at home in private , it was resolved that Mrs Dombey at least should be at home in public , without delay . A series of entertainments in celebration of the late nuptials , and in cultivation of society , were arranged , chiefly by Mr Dombey and Mrs Skewton ; and it was settled that the festive proceedings should commence by Mrs Dombey ’s being at home upon a certain evening , and by Mr and Mrs Dombey ’s requesting the honour of the company of a great many incongruous people to dinner on the same day . Accordingly , Mr Dombey produced a list of sundry eastern magnates who were to be bidden to this feast on his behalf ; to which Mrs Skewton , acting for her dearest child , who was haughtily careless on the subject , subjoined a western list , comprising Cousin Feenix , not yet returned to Baden - Baden , greatly to the detriment of his personal estate ; and a variety of moths of various degrees and ages , who had , at various times , fluttered round the light of her fair daughter , or herself , without any lasting injury to their wings . Florence was enrolled as a member of the dinner - party , by Edith ’s command — elicited by a moment ’s doubt and hesitation on the part of Mrs Skewton ; and Florence , with a wondering heart , and with a quick instinctive sense of everything that grated on her father in the least , took her silent share in the proceedings of the day . The proceedings commenced by Mr Dombey , in a cravat of extraordinary height and stiffness , walking restlessly about the drawing - room until the hour appointed for dinner ; punctual to which , an East India Director , of immense wealth , in a waistcoat apparently constructed in serviceable deal by some plain carpenter , but really engendered in the tailor ’s art , and composed of the material called nankeen , arrived and was received by Mr Dombey alone . The next stage of the proceedings was Mr Dombey ’s sending his compliments to Mrs Dombey , with a correct statement of the time ; and the next , the East India Director ’s falling prostrate , in a conversational point of view , and as Mr Dombey was not the man to pick him up , staring at the fire until rescue appeared in the shape of Mrs Skewton ; whom the director , as a pleasant start in life for the evening , mistook for Mrs Dombey , and greeted with enthusiasm . The next arrival was a Bank Director , reputed to be able to buy up anything — human Nature generally , if he should take it in his head to influence the money market in that direction — but who was a wonderfully modest - spoken man , almost boastfully so , and mentioned his “
259140	260191	260255	260256	Jack Adams	542	” at Kingston - upon - Thames , and its just being barely equal to giving Dombey a bed and a chop , if he would come and visit it . Ladies , he said , it was not for a man who lived in his quiet way to take upon himself to invite — but if Mrs Skewton and her daughter , Mrs Dombey , should ever find themselves in that direction , and would do him the honour to look at a little bit of a shrubbery they would find there , and a poor little flower - bed or so , and a humble apology for a pinery , and two or three little attempts of that sort without any pretension , they would distinguish him very much . Carrying out his character , this gentleman was very plainly dressed , in a wisp of cambric for a neckcloth , big shoes , a coat that was too loose for him , and a pair of trousers that were too spare ; and mention being made of the Opera by Mrs Skewton , he said he very seldom went there , for he could n’t afford it . It seemed greatly to delight and exhilarate him to say so : and he beamed on his audience afterwards , with his hands in his pockets , and excessive satisfaction twinkling in his eyes . Now Mrs Dombey appeared , beautiful and proud , and as disdainful and defiant of them all as if the bridal wreath upon her head had been a garland of steel spikes put on to force concession from her which she would die sooner than yield . With her was Florence . When they entered together , the shadow of the night of the return again darkened Mr Dombey ’s face . But unobserved ; for Florence did not venture to raise her eyes to his , and Edith ’s indifference was too supreme to take the least heed of him . The arrivals quickly became numerous . More directors , chairmen of public companies , elderly ladies carrying burdens on their heads for full dress , Cousin Feenix , Major Bagstock , friends of Mrs Skewton , with the same bright bloom on their complexion , and very precious necklaces on very withered necks . Among these , a young lady of sixty - five , remarkably coolly dressed as to her back and shoulders , who spoke with an engaging lisp , and whose eyelids would n’t keep up well , without a great deal of trouble on her part , and whose manners had that indefinable charm which so frequently attaches to the giddiness of youth . As the greater part of Mr Dombey ’s list were disposed to be taciturn , and the greater part of Mrs Dombey ’s list were disposed to be talkative , and there was no sympathy between them , Mrs Dombey ’s list , by magnetic agreement , entered into a bond of union against Mr Dombey ’s list , who , wandering about the rooms in a desolate manner , or seeking refuge in corners , entangled themselves with company coming in , and became barricaded behind sofas , and had doors opened smartly from without against their heads , and underwent every sort of discomfiture . When dinner was announced , Mr Dombey took down an old lady like a crimson velvet pincushion stuffed with bank notes , who might have been the identical old lady of Threadneedle Street , she was so rich , and looked so unaccommodating ; Cousin Feenix took down Mrs Dombey ; Major Bagstock took down Mrs Skewton ; the young thing with the shoulders was bestowed , as an extinguisher , upon the East India Director ; and the remaining ladies were left on view in the drawing - room by the remaining gentlemen , until a forlorn hope volunteered to conduct them downstairs , and those brave spirits with their captives blocked up the dining - room door , shutting out seven mild men in the stony - hearted hall . When all the rest were got in and were seated , one of these mild men still appeared , in smiling confusion , totally destitute and unprovided for , and , escorted by the butler , made the complete circuit of the table twice before his chair could be found , which it finally was , on Mrs Dombey ’s left hand ; after which the mild man never held up his head again . Now , the spacious dining - room , with the company seated round the glittering table , busy with their glittering spoons , and knives and forks , and plates , might have been taken for a grown - up exposition of Tom Tiddler ’s ground , where children pick up gold and silver . Mr Dombey , as Tiddler , looked his character to admiration ; and the long plateau of precious metal frosted , separating him from Mrs Dombey , whereon frosted Cupids offered scentless flowers to each of them , was allegorical to see . Cousin Feenix was in great force , and looked astonishingly young . But he was sometimes thoughtless in his good humour — his memory occasionally wandering like his legs — and on this occasion caused the company to shudder . It happened thus . The young lady with the back , who regarded Cousin Feenix with sentiments of tenderness , had entrapped the East India Director into leading her to the chair next him ; in return for which good office , she immediately abandoned the Director , who , being shaded on the other side by a gloomy black velvet hat surmounting a bony and speechless female with a fan , yielded to a depression of spirits and withdrew into himself . Cousin Feenix and the young lady were very lively and humorous , and the young lady laughed so much at something Cousin Feenix related to her , that Major Bagstock begged leave to inquire on behalf of Mrs Skewton ( they were sitting opposite , a little lower down ) , whether that might not be considered public property . “
260198	260203	260255	260256	Jack Adams	542	” said Cousin Feenix , “
260238	260249	260236	260236	Dombey	186	” for the general attention was concentrated on Cousin Feenix ; “
260334	260373	260327	260327	Dombey	186	” Mr Dombey , who was as likely to have known Guy Fawkes , replied in the negative . But one of the seven mild men unexpectedly leaped into distinction , by saying he had known him , and adding—“always
260378	260379	260327	260327	Dombey	186	” “
260382	260404	260327	260327	Dombey	186	” said Cousin Feenix , bending forward to see the mild man , and smile encouragement at him down the table . “
260412	260413	260409	260409	Joe	290	” “
260416	260429	260409	260409	Joe	290	” cried the mild man , rising in public estimation every Instant . “
260433	260438	260439	260439	you	186	” said Cousin Feenix , “
260445	260446	260439	260439	you	186	” “
260452	260466	260447	260447	I	0	” said the mild man . With whom Mr Dombey immediately took wine . “
260473	260485	260467	260469	Devilish good fellow	6147	” said Cousin Feenix , again bending forward , and smiling . “
260488	260500	260467	260469	Devilish good fellow	6147	” returned the mild man , becoming bold on his success . “
260510	260511	260501	260508	One of the best fellows I ever knew	6148	” “
260520	260525	260514	260514	you	186	” said Cousin Feenix . “
260530	260537	260514	260514	you	186	” replied the bold mild man , “
260547	260574	260542	260543	your Ludship	6149	” With that , he leaned back in his chair and smiled at the ceiling , as knowing it by heart , and being already tickled . “
260589	260609	260542	260543	your Ludship	6149	” said Cousin Feenix , addressing the table with a smile , and a gay shake of his head , “
260651	260652	260653	260653	Shropshire	544	” “
260655	260667	260653	260653	Shropshire	544	” said the bold mild man , finding himself appealed to . “
260685	260690	260653	260653	Shropshire	544	” said Cousin Feenix . “
260703	260715	260653	260653	Shropshire	544	” with a pleasant sense of the readiness of this joke , “
260894	261048	260885	260885	your	6160	” In his full enjoyment of this culminating point of his story , the shudder , which had gone all round the table like an electric spark , struck Cousin Feenix , and he stopped . Not a smile occasioned by the only general topic of conversation broached that day , appeared on any face . A profound silence ensued ; and the wretched mild man , who had been as innocent of any real foreknowledge of the story as the child unborn , had the exquisite misery of reading in every eye that he was regarded as the prime mover of the mischief . Mr Dombey ’s face was not a changeful one , and being cast in its mould of state that day , showed little other apprehension of the story , if any , than that which he expressed when he said solemnly , amidst the silence , that it was “
261052	261950	260885	260885	your	6160	” There was a rapid glance from Edith towards Florence , but otherwise she remained , externally , impassive and unconscious . Through the various stages of rich meats and wines , continual gold and silver , dainties of earth , air , fire , and water , heaped - up fruits , and that unnecessary article in Mr Dombey ’s banquets — ice — the dinner slowly made its way : the later stages being achieved to the sonorous music of incessant double knocks , announcing the arrival of visitors , whose portion of the feast was limited to the smell thereof . When Mrs Dombey rose , it was a sight to see her lord , with stiff throat and erect head , hold the door open for the withdrawal of the ladies ; and to see how she swept past him with his daughter on her arm . Mr Dombey was a grave sight , behind the decanters , in a state of dignity ; and the East India Director was a forlorn sight near the unoccupied end of the table , in a state of solitude ; and the Major was a military sight , relating stories of the Duke of York to six of the seven mild men ( the ambitious one was utterly quenched ) ; and the Bank Director was a lowly sight , making a plan of his little attempt at a pinery , with dessert - knives , for a group of admirers ; and Cousin Feenix was a thoughtful sight , as he smoothed his long wristbands and stealthily adjusted his wig . But all these sights were of short duration , being speedily broken up by coffee , and the desertion of the room . [ Illustration ] There was a throng in the state - rooms upstairs , increasing every minute ; but still Mr Dombey ’s list of visitors appeared to have some native impossibility of amalgamation with Mrs Dombey ’s list , and no one could have doubted which was which . The single exception to this rule perhaps was Mr Carker , who now smiled among the company , and who , as he stood in the circle that was gathered about Mrs Dombey — watchful of her , of them , his chief , Cleopatra and the Major , Florence , and everything around — appeared at ease with both divisions of guests , and not marked as exclusively belonging to either . Florence had a dread of him , which made his presence in the room a nightmare to her . She could not avoid the recollection of it , for her eyes were drawn towards him every now and then , by an attraction of dislike and distrust that she could not resist . Yet her thoughts were busy with other things ; for as she sat apart — not unadmired or unsought , but in the gentleness of her quiet spirit — she felt how little part her father had in what was going on , and saw , with pain , how ill at ease he seemed to be , and how little regarded he was as he lingered about near the door , for those visitors whom he wished to distinguish with particular attention , and took them up to introduce them to his wife , who received them with proud coldness , but showed no interest or wish to please , and never , after the bare ceremony of reception , in consultation of his wishes , or in welcome of his friends , opened her lips . It was not the less perplexing or painful to Florence , that she who acted thus , treated her so kindly and with such loving consideration , that it almost seemed an ungrateful return on her part even to know of what was passing before her eyes . Happy Florence would have been , might she have ventured to bear her father company , by so much as a look ; and happy Florence was , in little suspecting the main cause of his uneasiness . But afraid of seeming to know that he was placed at any disadvantage , lest he should be resentful of that knowledge ; and divided between her impulse towards him , and her grateful affection for Edith ; she scarcely dared to raise her eyes towards either . Anxious and unhappy for them both , the thought stole on her through the crowd , that it might have been better for them if this noise of tongues and tread of feet had never come there,—if the old dulness and decay had never been replaced by novelty and splendour,—if the neglected child had found no friend in Edith , but had lived her solitary life , unpitied and forgotten . Mrs Chick had some such thoughts too , but they were not so quietly developed in her mind . This good matron had been outraged in the first instance by not receiving an invitation to dinner . That blow partially recovered , she had gone to a vast expense to make such a figure before Mrs Dombey at home , as should dazzle the senses of that lady , and heap mortification , mountains high , on the head of Mrs Skewton . “
261956	261964	261952	261952	I	0	” said Mrs Chick to Mr Chick , “
261983	261984	261985	261986	No one	9841	” “
261991	262021	261985	261986	No one	9841	” assented Mr Chick , who was seated by the side of Mrs Chick against the wall , and could console himself , even there , by softly whistling . “
262034	262043	261985	261986	No one	9841	” exclaimed Mrs Chick , with flashing eyes . “
262056	262061	262049	262049	I	0	” said Mr Chick . “
262066	262075	262062	262062	Paul	237	” said Mrs Chick . Mr Chick whistled . “
262089	262096	262062	262062	Paul	237	” said Mrs Chick with candour , “
262157	262158	262160	262160	My	0	” “
262168	262175	262160	262160	My	0	” said Mr Chick , astounded . “
262178	262187	262160	262160	My	0	” retorted Mrs Chick , with great severity , “
262238	262254	262257	262257	I	0	” on which word Mrs Chick laid a scornful emphasis that made Mr Chick start , “
262266	262286	262257	262257	I	0	” Mr Chick screwed his mouth into a form irreconcilable with humming or whistling , and looked very contemplative . “
262298	262307	262290	262290	I	0	” said Mrs Chick , swelling with indignation , “
262356	262377	262339	262339	I	0	” said Mrs Chick , as if she expected to become so , about the day after to - morrow . “
262418	262920	262921	262921	I	0	” Mrs Chick rose erect with these words , and took the arm of Mr Chick , who escorted her from the room , after half an hour ’s shady sojourn there . And it is due to her penetration to observe that she certainly was not missed at all . But she was not the only indignant guest ; for Mr Dombey ’s list ( still constantly in difficulties ) were , as a body , indignant with Mrs Dombey ’s list , for looking at them through eyeglasses , and audibly wondering who all those people were ; while Mrs Dombey ’s list complained of weariness , and the young thing with the shoulders , deprived of the attentions of that gay youth Cousin Feenix ( who went away from the dinner - table ) , confidentially alleged to thirty or forty friends that she was bored to death . All the old ladies with the burdens on their heads , had greater or less cause of complaint against Mr Dombey ; and the Directors and Chairmen coincided in thinking that if Dombey must marry , he had better have married somebody nearer his own age , not quite so handsome , and a little better off . The general opinion among this class of gentlemen was , that it was a weak thing in Dombey , and he ’d live to repent it . Hardly anybody there , except the mild men , stayed , or went away , without considering himself or herself neglected and aggrieved by Mr Dombey or Mrs Dombey ; and the speechless female in the black velvet hat was found to have been stricken mute , because the lady in the crimson velvet had been handed down before her . The nature even of the mild men got corrupted , either from their curdling it with too much lemonade , or from the general inoculation that prevailed ; and they made sarcastic jokes to one another , and whispered disparagement on stairs and in bye - places . The general dissatisfaction and discomfort so diffused itself , that the assembled footmen in the hall were as well acquainted with it as the company above . Nay , the very linkmen outside got hold of it , and compared the party to a funeral out of mourning , with none of the company remembered in the will . At last , the guests were all gone , and the linkmen too ; and the street , crowded so long with carriages , was clear ; and the dying lights showed no one in the rooms , but Mr Dombey and Mr Carker , who were talking together apart , and Mrs Dombey and her mother : the former seated on an ottoman ; the latter reclining in the Cleopatra attitude , awaiting the arrival of her maid . Mr Dombey having finished his communication to Carker , the latter advanced obsequiously to take leave . “

262950	262957	262947	262948	Mrs Dombey	186	” said Mr Dombey , advancing , “
263025	263032	263034	263035	Mr Dombey	533	“ I am sorry , Madam , ”
263037	263048	263049	263049	She	186	“ that you should not have thought it your duty — ”
263055	263061	263049	263049	She	186	“ Your duty , Madam , ”
263066	263116	263049	263049	She	186	“ to have received my friends with a little more deference . Some of those whom you have been pleased to slight tonight in a very marked manner , Mrs Dombey , confer a distinction upon you , I must tell you , in any visit they pay you . ”

263137	263156	263158	263159	Mr Dombey	533	“ No ! Carker ! I beg that you do not . I insist that you do not , ”
263169	263225	263158	263159	Mr Dombey	533	“ Mr Carker , Madam , as you know , possesses my confidence . He is as well acquainted as myself with the subject on which I speak . I beg to tell you , for your information , Mrs Dombey , that I consider these wealthy and important persons confer a distinction upon me : ”
263244	263249	263250	263250	she	6179	“ I ask you , ”
263262	263274	263250	263250	she	6179	“ do you know that there is someone here , Sir ? ”
263275	263280	263282	263283	Mr Carker	533	“ I must entreat , ”
263288	263309	263282	263283	Mr Carker	533	“ I must beg , I must demand , to be released . Slight and unimportant as this difference is — ”
263328	263333	263334	263334	she	430	“ My sweetest Edith , ”
263337	263360	263334	263334	she	430	“ and my dearest Dombey ; our excellent friend Mr Carker , for so I am sure I ought to mention him — ”
263365	263370	263361	263362	Mr Carker	533	“ Too much honour . ”
263371	263431	263432	263432	Flowers	545	“ — has used the very words that were in my mind , and that I have been dying , these ages , for an opportunity of introducing . Slight and unimportant ! My sweetest Edith , and my dearest Dombey , do we not know that any difference between you two — No , Flowers ; not now . ”
263447	263455	263457	263458	Mrs Skewton	430	“ That any difference between you two , ”
263460	263644	263457	263458	Mrs Skewton	430	“ with the Heart you possess in common , and the excessively charming bond of feeling that there is between you , must be slight and unimportant ? What words could better define the fact ? None . Therefore I am glad to take this slight occasion — this trifling occasion , that is so replete with Nature , and your individual characters , and all that — so truly calculated to bring the tears into a parent ’s eyes — to say that I attach no importance to them in the least , except as developing these minor elements of Soul ; and that , unlike most Mamas - in - law ( that odious phrase , dear Dombey ! ) as they have been represented to me to exist in this I fear too artificial world , I never shall attempt to interpose between you , at such a time , and never can much regret , after all , such little flashes of the torch of What’s - his - name — not Cupid , but the other delightful creature . ”

265131	265136	265138	265139	Mr Carker	533	“ I have presumed , ”
265141	265162	265138	265139	Mr Carker	533	“ to solicit an interview , and I have ventured to describe it as being one of business , because — ”
265163	265177	265179	265179	Edith	481	“ Perhaps you are charged by Mr Dombey with some message of reproof , ”
265180	265207	265138	265139	Mr Carker	533	“ You possess Mr Dombey ’s confidence in such an unusual degree , Sir , that you would scarcely surprise me if that were your business . ”

265299	265304	265306	265306	Cleopatra	432	“ My dearest Edith , ”
265321	265338	265313	265313	she	432	“ really very charming of Mr What’s - his - name . And full of heart ! ”

So slight a difference , as between the principals — between those who love each other with disinterested devotion , and would make any sacrifice of self in such a cause — is nothing . As Mrs Skewton herself expressed , with so much truth and feeling last night , it is nothing . ”
265455	265462	265448	265448	she	481	“ And your business , Sir — ”
265463	265469	265471	265472	Mrs Skewton	430	“ Edith , my pet , ”
265474	265495	265496	265496	He	533	“ all this time Mr Carker is standing ! My dear Mr Carker , take a seat , I beg . ”
265599	265607	265609	265609	Carker	533	“ May I be allowed , Madam , ”

265715	265728	265709	265709	he	533	Voice—“Miss Florence — the young lady who has just left the room — ”
265784	265790	265791	265791	he	533	“ Miss Florence ’s position , ”
265794	265830	265791	265791	he	533	“ has been an unfortunate one . I have a difficulty in alluding to it to you , whose attachment to her father is naturally watchful and jealous of every word that applies to him . ”
265866	265927	265928	265928	Edith	481	“ But , as one who is devoted to Mr Dombey in his different way , and whose life is passed in admiration of Mr Dombey ’s character , may I say , without offence to your tenderness as a wife , that Miss Florence has unhappily been neglected — by her father . May I say by her father ? ”
265931	265936	265928	265928	Edith	481	“ I know it . ”
265937	265942	265944	265945	Mr Carker	533	“ You know it ! ”
265954	265988	265944	265945	Mr Carker	533	“ It removes a mountain from my breast . May I hope you know how the neglect originated ; in what an amiable phase of Mr Dombey ’s pride — character I mean ? ”
265989	265998	265928	265928	Edith	481	“ You may pass that by , Sir , ”
266002	266017	265999	265999	she	481	“ and come the sooner to the end of what you have to say . ”
266018	266027	265944	265945	Mr Carker	533	“ Indeed , I am sensible , Madam , ”
266029	266080	265999	265999	she	481	Carker,—“trust me , I am deeply sensible , that Mr Dombey can require no justification in anything to you . But , kindly judge of my breast by your own , and you will forgive my interest in him , if in its excess , it goes at all astray . ”
266176	266180	266182	266182	Carker	533	“ Miss Florence , ”
266184	266288	266182	266182	Carker	533	“ left to the care — if one may call it care — of servants and mercenary people , in every way her inferiors , necessarily wanted some guide and compass in her younger days , and , naturally , for want of them , has been indiscreet , and has in some degree forgotten her station . There was some folly about one Walter , a common lad , who is fortunately dead now : and some very undesirable association , I regret to say , with certain coasting sailors , of anything but good repute , and a runaway old bankrupt . ”
266289	266298	266300	266300	Edith	481	“ I have heard the circumstances , Sir , ”
266309	266328	266300	266300	Edith	481	“ and I know that you pervert them . You may not know it . I hope so . ”
266329	266333	266335	266336	Mr Carker	533	“ Pardon me , ”
266338	266527	266335	266336	Mr Carker	533	“ I believe that nobody knows them so well as I. Your generous and ardent nature , Madam — the same nature which is so nobly imperative in vindication of your beloved and honoured husband , and which has blessed him as even his merits deserve — I must respect , defer to , bow before . But , as regards the circumstances , which is indeed the business I presumed to solicit your attention to , I can have no doubt , since , in the execution of my trust as Mr Dombey ’s confidential — I presume to say — friend , I have fully ascertained them . In my execution of that trust ; in my deep concern , which you can so well understand , for everything relating to him , intensified , if you will ( for I fear I labour under your displeasure ) , by the lower motive of desire to prove my diligence , and make myself the more acceptable ; I have long pursued these circumstances by myself and trustworthy instruments , and have innumerable and most minute proofs . ”
266552	266558	266559	266559	he	6212	“ Pardon me , Madam , ”
266562	266596	266559	266559	he	6212	“ if in my perplexity , I presume to take counsel with you , and to consult your pleasure . I think I have observed that you are greatly interested in Miss Florence ? ”
266652	266731	266630	266630	she	6211	“ This interest , Madam — so touching an evidence of everything associated with Mr Dombey being dear to you — induces me to pause before I make him acquainted with these circumstances , which , as yet , he does not know . It so shakes me , if I may make the confession , in my allegiance , that on the intimation of the least desire to that effect from you , I would suppress them . ”
266764	266964	266965	266965	She	6214	“ You say that as I describe them , they are perverted . I fear not — I fear not : but let us assume that they are . The uneasiness I have for some time felt on the subject , arises in this : that the mere circumstance of such association often repeated , on the part of Miss Florence , however innocently and confidingly , would be conclusive with Mr Dombey , already predisposed against her , and would lead him to take some step ( I know he has occasionally contemplated it ) of separation and alienation of her from his home . Madam , bear with me , and remember my intercourse with Mr Dombey , and my knowledge of him , and my reverence for him , almost from childhood , when I say that if he has a fault , it is a lofty stubbornness , rooted in that noble pride and sense of power which belong to him , and which we must all defer to ; which is not assailable like the obstinacy of other characters ; and which grows upon itself from day to day , and year to year . ”
267034	267045	267046	267046	he	6215	“ Even so slight an incident as last night ’s , ”
267049	267314	267046	267046	he	6215	“ if I might refer to it once more , would serve to illustrate my meaning , better than a greater one . Dombey and Son know neither time , nor place , nor season , but bear them all down . But I rejoice in its occurrence , for it has opened the way for me to approach Mrs Dombey with this subject today , even if it has entailed upon me the penalty of her temporary displeasure . Madam , in the midst of my uneasiness and apprehension on this subject , I was summoned by Mr Dombey to Leamington . There I saw you . There I could not help knowing what relation you would shortly occupy towards him — to his enduring happiness and yours . There I resolved to await the time of your establishment at home here , and to do as I have now done . I have , at heart , no fear that I shall be wanting in my duty to Mr Dombey , if I bury what I know in your breast ; for where there is but one heart and mind between two persons — as in such a marriage — one almost represents the other . I can acquit my conscience therefore , almost equally , by confidence , on such a theme , in you or him . For the reasons I have mentioned I would select you . May I aspire to the distinction of believing that my confidence is accepted , and that I am relieved from my responsibility ? ”
267344	267368	267341	267341	she	6218	“ I accept it , Sir You will please to consider this matter at an end , and that it goes no farther . ”
267499	267505	267492	267492	her	6218	“ Oh Florence , Florence ! ”
267762	267783	267749	267750	the Maid	6181	“ If you please , Ma’am , I beg your pardon , but I ca n’t do nothing with Missis ! ”
267784	267790	267792	267792	Edith	481	“ What do you mean ? ”
267794	267799	267801	267803	the frightened maid	6233	“ Well , Ma’am , ”
267805	267815	267801	267803	the frightened maid	6233	“ I hardly know . She ’s making faces ! ”
268130	268136	268137	268138	The maid	6181	“ Rose - coloured curtains . ”
268163	268171	268148	268148	Cleopatra	432	“ Rose - coloured curtains for doctors . ”
268533	268539	268540	268540	she	6248	“ Where is Mrs Dombey ? ”
268547	268553	268540	268540	she	6248	“ Gone out , Ma’am . ”
268554	268569	268540	268540	she	6248	“ Gone out ! Does she go out to shun her Mama , Flowers ? ”
268570	268592	268540	268540	she	6248	“ La bless you , no , Ma’am . Mrs Dombey has only gone out for a ride with Miss Florence . ”
268593	268621	268540	268540	she	6248	“ Miss Florence . Who ’s Miss Florence ? Do n’t tell me about Miss Florence . What ’s Miss Florence to her , compared to me ? ”
268707	268716	268717	268717	she	6248	“ Well , I am sure , Edith ! ”
268725	268733	268722	268722	her	6248	“ What is the matter , mother ? ”
268734	268829	268686	268686	Edith	481	“ Matter ! I really do n’t know what is the matter . The world is coming to such an artificial and ungrateful state , that I begin to think there ’s no Heart — or anything of that sort — left in it , positively . Withers is more a child to me than you are . He attends to me much more than my own daughter . I almost wish I did n’t look so young — and all that kind of thing — and then perhaps I should be more considered . ”
268830	268838	268686	268686	Edith	481	“ What would you have , mother ? ”
268839	268848	268722	268722	her	6248	“ Oh , a great deal , Edith , ”
268851	268871	268722	268722	her	6248	“ Is there anything you want that you have not ? It is your own fault if there be . ”
268872	268877	268686	268686	Edith	481	“ My own fault ! ”
268882	268958	268686	268686	Edith	481	“ The parent I have been to you , Edith : making you a companion from your cradle ! And when you neglect me , and have no more natural affection for me than if I was a stranger — not a twentieth part of the affection that you have for Florence — but I am only your mother , and should corrupt her in a day!—you reproach me with its being my own fault . ”
268959	268978	268686	268686	Edith	481	“ Mother , mother , I reproach you with nothing . Why will you always dwell on this ? ”
268979	269013	268686	268686	Edith	481	“ Is n’t it natural that I should dwell on this , when I am all affection and sensitiveness , and am wounded in the cruellest way , whenever you look at me ? ”
269014	269042	268686	268686	Edith	481	“ I do not mean to wound you , mother . Have you no remembrance of what has been said between us ? Let the Past rest . ”
269043	269121	268686	268686	Edith	481	“ Yes , rest ! And let gratitude to me rest ; and let affection for me rest ; and let me rest in my out - of - the - way room , with no society and no attention , while you find new relations to make much of , who have no earthly claim upon you ! Good gracious , Edith , do you know what an elegant establishment you are at the head of ? ”
269122	269127	268686	268686	Edith	481	“ Yes . Hush ! ”
269128	269169	268686	268686	Edith	481	“ And that gentlemanly creature , Dombey ? Do you know that you are married to him , Edith , and that you have a settlement and a position , and a carriage , and I do n’t know what ? ”
269170	269181	268686	268686	Edith	481	“ Indeed , I know it , mother ; well . ”
269182	269218	268686	268686	Edith	481	“ As you would have had with that delightful good soul — what did they call him?—Granger — if he had n’t died . And who have you to thank for all this , Edith ? ”
269219	269226	268686	268686	Edith	481	“ You , mother ; you . ”
269227	269303	268686	268686	Edith	481	“ Then put your arms round my neck , and kiss me ; and show me , Edith , that you know there never was a better Mama than I have been to you . And do n’t let me become a perfect fright with teasing and wearing myself at your ingratitude , or when I ’m out again in society no soul will know me , not even that hateful animal , the Major . ”
269863	269877	269855	269855	she	275	“ deeply hurt by the unmerited contumely she had met with from Louisa . ”
270147	270190	270143	270143	her	275	“ that she had passed a great many happy hours in that house , which she must ever remember with gratification , and that she could never cease to regard Mr Dombey as one of the most impressive and dignified of men . ”
270515	270521	270523	270524	Mr Toodle	236	“ Polly , my gal , ”
270563	270574	270523	270524	Mr Toodle	236	hand—“you ai n’t seen our Biler lately , have you ? ”
270575	270578	270580	270580	Polly	218	“ No , ”
270582	270605	270580	270580	Polly	218	“ but he ’s almost certain to look in tonight . It ’s his right evening , and he ’s very regular . ”
270606	270610	270612	270613	Mr Toodle	236	“ I suppose , ”
270620	270641	270612	270613	Mr Toodle	236	“ as our Biler is a doin’ now about as well as a boy can do , eh , Polly ? ”
270642	270651	270653	270653	Polly	218	“ Oh ! he ’s a doing beautiful ! ”
270655	270673	270675	270676	Mr Toodle	236	“ He ai n’t got to be at all secret - like — has he , Polly ? ”
270678	270681	270683	270684	Mrs Toodle	228	“ No ! ”
270688	270706	270711	270711	his	236	“ I ’m glad he ai n’t got to be at all secret - like , Polly , ”
270736	270749	270731	270731	he	236	“ because that do n’t look well ; do it , Polly ? ”
270750	270766	270711	270711	his	236	“ Why , of course it do n’t , father . How can you ask ! ”
270767	270776	270778	270779	Mr Toodle	236	“ You see , my boys and gals , ”
270787	270843	270778	270779	Mr Toodle	236	“ wotever you ’re up to in a honest way , it ’s my opinion as you ca n’t do better than be open . If you find yourselves in cuttings or in tunnels , do n’t you play no secret games . Keep your whistles going , and let ’s know where you are . ”
270864	270877	270879	270880	his wife	9766	“ But what makes you say this along of Rob , father ? ”
270884	270888	270879	270880	his wife	9766	“ Polly , old “
270891	270896	270879	270880	his wife	9766	” said Mr Toodle , “
270970	270975	270962	270963	a Junction	6295	” said Mr Toodle , “
270982	271039	270962	270963	a Junction	6295	” This profound reflection Mr Toodle washed down with a pint mug of tea , and proceeded to solidify with a great weight of bread and butter ; charging his young daughters meanwhile , to keep plenty of hot water in the pot , as he was uncommon dry , and should take the indefinite quantity of “
271045	271334	270962	270963	a Junction	6295	” before his thirst was appeased . In satisfying himself , however , Mr Toodle was not regardless of the younger branches about him , who , although they had made their own evening repast , were on the look - out for irregular morsels , as possessing a relish . These he distributed now and then to the expectant circle , by holding out great wedges of bread and butter , to be bitten at by the family in lawful succession , and by serving out small doses of tea in like manner with a spoon ; which snacks had such a relish in the mouths of these young Toodles , that , after partaking of the same , they performed private dances of ecstasy among themselves , and stood on one leg apiece , and hopped , and indulged in other saltatory tokens of gladness . These vents for their excitement found , they gradually closed about Mr Toodle again , and eyed him hard as he got through more bread and butter and tea ; affecting , however , to have no further expectations of their own in reference to those viands , but to be conversing on foreign subjects , and whispering confidentially . Mr Toodle , in the midst of this family group , and setting an awful example to his children in the way of appetite , was conveying the two young Toodles on his knees to Birmingham by special engine , and was contemplating the rest over a barrier of bread and butter , when Rob the Grinder , in his sou’wester hat and mourning slops , presented himself , and was received with a general rush of brothers and sisters . “
271339	271347	271337	271337	mother	12864	” said Rob , dutifully kissing her ; “
271354	271355	271352	271352	mother	12864	” “
271361	271376	271352	271352	mother	12864	” cried Polly , giving him a hug and a pat on the back . “
271387	271417	271385	271385	he	10009	” This was intended for Mr Toodle ’s private edification , but Rob the Grinder , whose withers were not unwrung , caught the words as they were spoken . “
271433	271439	271431	271431	he	10009	” cried the injured innocent . “
271481	271496	271545	271545	he	10009	” cried Rob , resorting to his coat - cuff in anguish of spirit , “
271510	271511	271512	271512	My	0	” “
271516	271520	271512	271512	My	0	” cried Polly , “
271527	271528	271521	271521	father	10009	” “
271536	271542	271545	271545	he	10009	” blubbered the injured Grinder , “
271602	271748	271592	271592	I	0	” At these desperate words all the young Toodles shrieked ; a pathetic effect , which the Grinder improved by ironically adjuring them not to cry for him , for they ought to hate him , they ought , if they was good boys and girls ; and this so touched the youngest Toodle but one , who was easily moved , that it touched him not only in his spirit but in his wind too ; making him so purple that Mr Toodle in consternation carried him out to the water - butt , and would have put him under the tap , but for his being recovered by the sight of that instrument . Matters having reached this point , Mr Toodle explained , and the virtuous feelings of his son being thereby calmed , they shook hands , and harmony reigned again . “
271761	271774	271750	271750	you	6310	” inquired his father , returning to his tea with new strength . “
271788	271789	271783	271783	I	0	” “
271799	271803	271797	271797	Rob	424	” said Polly . “
272026	272027	272000	272001	the Cap’en	394	” “
272042	272046	272049	272049	mother	12864	” said Polly . “
272101	272102	272094	272094	I	0	” “
272111	272123	272109	272109	Rob	424	” cried his mother ; while Mr Toodle opened his eyes . “
272131	272140	272109	272109	Rob	424	” returned the Grinder , with a wink . “
272173	272258	272164	272164	I	0	” The indisputable proof afforded in these hints , and in the Grinder ’s mysterious manner , of his not being subject to that failing which Mr Toodle had , by implication , attributed to him , might have led to a renewal of his wrongs , and of the sensation in the family , but for the opportune arrival of another visitor , who , to Polly ’s great surprise , appeared at the door , smiling patronage and friendship on all there . “
272267	272272	272264	272265	Mrs Richards	227	” said Miss Tox . “
272285	272498	272281	272281	I	0	” The cheery face of Mrs Richards shone with a hospitable reply , and Miss Tox , accepting the proffered chair , and gracefully recognising Mr Toodle on her way to it , untied her bonnet strings , and said that in the first place she must beg the dear children , one and all , to come and kiss her . [ Illustration ] The ill - starred youngest Toodle but one , who would appear , from the frequency of his domestic troubles , to have been born under an unlucky planet , was prevented from performing his part in this general salutation by having fixed the sou’wester hat ( with which he had been previously trifling ) deep on his head , hind side before , and being unable to get it off again ; which accident presenting to his terrified imagination a dismal picture of his passing the rest of his days in darkness , and in hopeless seclusion from his friends and family , caused him to struggle with great violence , and to utter suffocating cries . Being released , his face was discovered to be very hot , and red , and damp ; and Miss Tox took him on her lap , much exhausted . “
272510	272518	272505	272505	Sir	735	” said Miss Tox to Mr Toodle . “
272525	272529	272521	272521	Ma’am	219	” said Toodle . “
272543	272544	272531	272531	we	6338	” “
272554	272561	272552	272552	Sir	735	” inquired Miss Tox , blandly . “
272568	272572	272564	272564	Ma’am	219	” replied Toodle . “
272608	272609	272601	272601	’em	6340	” “
272613	272618	272611	272611	you	735	” said Miss Tox . “
272630	272631	272619	272619	I	0	” “
272639	272644	272645	272646	Many people	6343	” returned Mr Toodle . “
272665	272686	272662	272663	my mother	12897	” But catching his wife ’s eye here , Mr Toodle judiciously buried the rest in another mug of tea . “
272696	272705	272693	272694	Mrs Richards	227	” cried Miss Tox , looking at Rob , “
272711	272712	272713	272713	Eldest	555	” “
272717	272721	272713	272713	Eldest	555	” said Polly . “
272746	272747	272731	272733	the little fellow	10286	” “
272753	272757	272759	272759	him	10286	” said Toodle , “
272769	272783	272766	272766	they	6346	” said Mr Toodle , with a touch of poetry in his tone , “
272797	272858	272790	272791	Mr Dombey	506	” The recollection almost overpowered Miss Tox . The subject of it had a peculiar interest for her directly . She asked him to shake hands , and congratulated his mother on his frank , ingenuous face . Rob , overhearing her , called up a look , to justify the eulogium , but it was hardly the right look . “
272865	272868	272869	272869	you	227	” said Miss Tox,—“and
272874	272876	272869	272869	you	227	” addressing Toodle—“I’ll
272943	272992	272937	272937	I	0	” Polly , who , with a woman ’s tact , understood this at once , expressed as much in a little look . Mr Toodle , who had not the faintest idea of what Miss Tox was talking about , expressed that also , in a stare . “
272996	273001	272937	272937	I	0	” said Miss Tox , “
273045	273052	273030	273030	I	0	” Miss Tox ’s voice faltered ; “
273060	273097	273107	273107	you	735	” Mr Toodle , enlightened , shook his head , and said he had heerd it said , and , for his own part , he did think , as Mr Dombey was a difficult subject . “
273110	273115	273107	273107	you	735	” returned Miss Tox . “
273172	273198	273201	273201	I	0	” Mr Toodle , who had not entertained the least doubt of offering a remark that would be received with acquiescence , was greatly confounded . “
273209	273212	273201	273201	I	0	” resumed Miss Tox,—“and
273358	273365	273351	273351	I	0	” said Miss Tox , earnestly , “
273389	273416	273417	273417	You	227	” Polly was gratified , and showed it . Mr Toodle did n’t know whether he was gratified or not , and preserved a stolid calmness . “
273423	273426	273420	273421	Mrs Richards	227	” said Miss Tox—“and
273531	273559	273564	273565	a stranger	9917	” Mr Toodle , who had a great respect for learning , jerked his head approvingly at his wife , and moistened his hands with dawning satisfaction . “
273575	273580	273567	273567	I	0	” said Miss Tox , “
273638	273639	273632	273632	Sir	735	” “
273644	273649	273642	273642	Mum	224	” said Mr Toodle . “
273660	273661	273665	273665	you	735	” “
273672	273677	273670	273670	Sir	735	” rejoined Miss Tox , “
273745	273993	273995	273995	him	6374	” The bargain was ratified on the spot ; and Miss Tox found herself so much at home already , that without delay she instituted a preliminary examination of the children all round — which Mr Toodle much admired — and booked their ages , names , and acquirements , on a piece of paper . This ceremony , and a little attendant gossip , prolonged the time until after their usual hour of going to bed , and detained Miss Tox at the Toodle fireside until it was too late for her to walk home alone . The gallant Grinder , however , being still there , politely offered to attend her to her own door ; and as it was something to Miss Tox to be seen home by a youth whom Mr Dombey had first inducted into those manly garments which are rarely mentioned by name , she very readily accepted the proposal . After shaking hands with Mr Toodle and Polly , and kissing all the children , Miss Tox left the house , therefore , with unlimited popularity , and carrying away with her so light a heart that it might have given Mrs Chick offence if that good lady could have weighed it . Rob the Grinder , in his modesty , would have walked behind , but Miss Tox desired him to keep beside her , for conversational purposes ; and , as she afterwards expressed it to his mother , “
273998	274075	273995	273995	him	6374	” upon the road . He drew out so bright , and clear , and shining , that Miss Tox was charmed with him . The more Miss Tox drew him out , the finer he came — like wire . There never was a better or more promising youth — a more affectionate , steady , prudent , sober , honest , meek , candid young man — than Rob drew out , that night . “
274081	274092	274097	274097	I	0	” said Miss Tox , arrived at her own door , “
274128	274129	274132	274132	Ma’am	219	” “
274134	274138	274132	274132	Ma’am	219	” returned Rob ; “
274157	274162	274164	274165	Miss Tox	208	“ Very laudable indeed , ”
274167	274187	274164	274165	Miss Tox	208	“ I ’m glad to hear it . Put this half - crown into it , if you please . ”
274188	274195	274197	274197	Rob	424	“ Oh thank you , Ma’am , ”
274199	274210	274197	274197	Rob	424	“ but really I could n’t think of depriving you . ”
274211	274218	274220	274221	Miss Tox	208	“ I commend your independent spirit , ”
274223	274260	274220	274221	Miss Tox	208	“ but it ’s no deprivation , I assure you . I shall be offended if you do n’t take it , as a mark of my good - will . Good - night , Robin . ”
274261	274268	274270	274270	Rob	424	“ Good - night , Ma’am , ”
274272	274277	274270	274270	Rob	424	“ and thank you ! ”
274759	275410	275650	275651	Captain Gills	527	Wal”r , had proved altogether so favourable as he could have wished , and as he at the time believed . The Captain was troubled with a serious misgiving that he had done more harm than good , in short ; and in his remorse and modesty he made the best atonement he could think of , by putting himself out of the way of doing any harm to anyone , and , as it were , throwing himself overboard for a dangerous person . Self - buried , therefore , among the instruments , the Captain never went near Mr Dombey ’s house , or reported himself in any way to Florence or Miss Nipper . He even severed himself from Mr Perch , on the occasion of his next visit , by dryly informing that gentleman , that he thanked him for his company , but had cut himself adrift from all such acquaintance , as he did n’t know what magazine he might n’t blow up , without meaning of it . In this self - imposed retirement , the Captain passed whole days and weeks without interchanging a word with anyone but Rob the Grinder , whom he esteemed as a pattern of disinterested attachment and fidelity . In this retirement , the Captain , gazing at the packet of an evening , would sit smoking , and thinking of Florence and poor Walter , until they both seemed to his homely fancy to be dead , and to have passed away into eternal youth , the beautiful and innocent children of his first remembrance . The Captain did not , however , in his musings , neglect his own improvement , or the mental culture of Rob the Grinder . That young man was generally required to read out of some book to the Captain , for one hour , every evening ; and as the Captain implicitly believed that all books were true , he accumulated , by this means , many remarkable facts . On Sunday nights , the Captain always read for himself , before going to bed , a certain Divine Sermon once delivered on a Mount ; and although he was accustomed to quote the text , without book , after his own manner , he appeared to read it with as reverent an understanding of its heavenly spirit , as if he had got it all by heart in Greek , and had been able to write any number of fierce theological disquisitions on its every phrase . Rob the Grinder , whose reverence for the inspired writings , under the admirable system of the Grinders ’ School , had been developed by a perpetual bruising of his intellectual shins against all the proper names of all the tribes of Judah , and by the monotonous repetition of hard verses , especially by way of punishment , and by the parading of him at six years old in leather breeches , three times a Sunday , very high up , in a very hot church , with a great organ buzzing against his drowsy head , like an exceedingly busy bee — Rob the Grinder made a mighty show of being edified when the Captain ceased to read , and generally yawned and nodded while the reading was in progress . The latter fact being never so much as suspected by the good Captain . Captain Cuttle , also , as a man of business ; took to keeping books . In these he entered observations on the weather , and on the currents of the waggons and other vehicles : which he observed , in that quarter , to set westward in the morning and during the greater part of the day , and eastward towards the evening . Two or three stragglers appearing in one week , who “
275412	275649	275650	275651	Captain Gills	527	him”—so the Captain entered it — on the subject of spectacles , and who , without positively purchasing , said they would look in again , the Captain decided that the business was improving , and made an entry in the day - book to that effect : the wind then blowing ( which he first recorded ) pretty fresh , west and by north ; having changed in the night . One of the Captain ’s chief difficulties was Mr Toots , who called frequently , and who without saying much seemed to have an idea that the little back parlour was an eligible room to chuckle in , as he would sit and avail himself of its accommodations in that regard by the half - hour together , without at all advancing in intimacy with the Captain . The Captain , rendered cautious by his late experience , was unable quite to satisfy his mind whether Mr Toots was the mild subject he appeared to be , or was a profoundly artful and dissimulating hypocrite . His frequent reference to Miss Dombey was suspicious ; but the Captain had a secret kindness for Mr Toots ’s apparent reliance on him , and forbore to decide against him for the present ; merely eyeing him , with a sagacity not to be described , whenever he approached the subject that was nearest to his heart . “
275653	275670	275650	275651	Captain Gills	527	” blurted out Mr Toots , one day all at once , as his manner was , “
275693	275694	275672	275672	you	527	” “
275707	275723	275697	275697	I	0	” replied the Captain , who had at length concluded on a course of action ; “
275733	275734	275724	275724	I	0	” “
275745	275750	275735	275736	Captain Gills	527	” retorted Mr Toots . “
275785	275786	275787	275787	You	527	” “
275792	275798	275787	275787	You	527	” argued the Captain slowly , “
275805	275806	275799	275799	I	0	” “
275817	275827	275814	275815	Captain Gills	527	” replied Mr Toots , steadfast to his point , “
275840	275876	275829	275829	you	527	” The Captain seemed struck by the originality and power of this remark , and looked at Mr Toots as if he thought there was a great deal more in him than he had expected . “
275883	275893	275829	275829	you	527	” observed the Captain , nodding his head thoughtfully ; “
275924	275925	275926	275927	Captain Gills	527	” “
275929	275946	275926	275927	Captain Gills	527	” said Mr Toots , gesticulating violently with the hand in which he held his hat , “
276031	276051	276052	276053	My lad	1268	” Mr Toots said it with watery eyes , and pressed his hat against his bosom with deep emotion . “
276055	276064	276052	276053	My lad	1268	” returned the Captain , moved to compassion , “
276071	276072	276073	276074	Captain Gills	527	” “
276076	276081	276073	276074	Captain Gills	527	” cried Mr Toots , “
276148	276239	276246	276246	you	0	” And Mr Toots looked hurriedly about the room , as if for some sufficiently painful means of accomplishing his dread purpose . The Captain pushed his glazed hat back upon his head , stroked his face down with his heavy hand — making his nose more mottled in the process — and planting himself before Mr Toots , and hooking him by the lapel of his coat , addressed him in these words , while Mr Toots looked up into his face , with much attention and some wonder . “
276252	276257	276246	276246	you	0	” said the Captain , “
276452	276453	276450	276450	brother	3124	” “
276464	276469	276461	276462	Captain Gills	527	” replied Mr Toots , “
276511	276521	276522	276522	I	0	here!”—Mr Toots pathetically touched his shirt - front with both hands—“that
276537	276538	276539	276539	Them	6416	” “
276541	276546	276550	276550	I	0	” said the Captain , “
276581	276582	276583	276584	Captain Gills	527	” “
276586	276591	276583	276584	Captain Gills	527	” returned Mr Toots , “
276678	276692	276669	276669	I	0	” said Mr Toots , holding back his extended hand for a moment , “
276725	276726	276727	276728	My lad	1268	” “
276730	276748	276727	276728	My lad	1268	” said the Captain , whose opinion of Mr Toots was much improved by this candid avowal , “
276782	276783	276788	276789	Captain Gills	527	” “
276791	276796	276788	276789	Captain Gills	527	” returned Mr Toots , “
276804	276974	276797	276797	I	0	” Mr Toots gave Captain Cuttle his hand upon it , then and there ; and the Captain with a pleasant and gracious show of condescension , bestowed his acquaintance upon him formally . Mr Toots seemed much relieved and gladdened by the acquisition , and chuckled rapturously during the remainder of his visit . The Captain , for his part , was not ill pleased to occupy that position of patronage , and was exceedingly well satisfied by his own prudence and foresight . But rich as Captain Cuttle was in the latter quality , he received a surprise that same evening from a no less ingenuous and simple youth , than Rob the Grinder . That artless lad , drinking tea at the same table , and bending meekly over his cup and saucer , having taken sidelong observations of his master for some time , who was reading the newspaper with great difficulty , but much dignity , through his glasses , broke silence by saying — “
277000	277001	276996	276996	you	0	” “
277007	277012	276996	276996	you	0	” replied the Captain . “
277024	277028	277022	277022	Captain	1240	” said Rob . “
277033	277046	277022	277022	Captain	1240	” cried the Captain , lifting up his bushy eyebrows a little . “
277059	277063	277049	277049	I	0	” said Rob . “
277071	277084	277068	277068	you	0	” asked the Captain , looking round at him over the glasses . “
277101	277132	277099	277099	Captain	1240	” asked Rob , with a sneaking smile . The Captain put down the paper , took off his spectacles , and brought his eyes to bear on the deserter . “
277157	277169	277148	277148	you	1240	” said Rob , rubbing his hands , and getting up . “
277216	277217	277210	277210	you	1240	” “
277234	277247	277229	277229	you	1240	” said the Captain , after a long examination of his face . “
277260	277273	277275	277275	he	6438	” cried the tender Rob , injured and indignant in a moment , “
277353	277369	277351	277351	you	1240	” The stricken Grinder wept , and put his coat - cuff in his eye . “
277374	277380	277372	277372	Captain	1240	” cried the injured youth , “
277498	277518	277495	277495	I	0	” All of which the Grinder howled forth in a lachrymose whine , and backing carefully towards the door . “
277533	277542	277528	277528	you	1240	” said the Captain , eyeing him intently . “
277561	277570	277548	277548	you	1240	” cried Rob , backing more and more ; “
277716	277717	277711	277711	you	1240	” “
277725	277731	277711	277711	you	1240	” replied the peaceful Captain . “
277743	277744	277734	277734	you	1240	” “
277762	277780	277751	277751	you	1240	” retorted the roused innocent , getting louder in his whine , and backing into the shop . “
277792	277793	277784	277784	you	1240	” “
277796	277802	277803	277803	you	1240	” pursued the Captain calmly , “
277820	277821	277803	277803	you	1240	” “
277830	277836	277825	277825	I	0	” cried the taunting Grinder . “
277851	277852	277842	277842	I	0	” “
277855	277860	277842	277842	I	0	” said the Captain , “
277899	277900	277895	277895	You	1268	” “
277914	277923	277910	277910	I	0	” cried Rob , exulting in his success . “
277970	278091	277958	277958	you	1240	” His employer settled the last point by producing the tin canister and telling the Grinder ’s money out in full upon the table . Rob , snivelling and sobbing , and grievously wounded in his feelings , took up the pieces one by one , with a sob and a snivel for each , and tied them up separately in knots in his pockethandkerchief ; then he ascended to the roof of the house and filled his hat and pockets with pigeons ; then , came down to his bed under the counter and made up his bundle , snivelling and sobbing louder , as if he were cut to the heart by old associations ; then he whined , “
278104	278561	278562	278564	My young man	6464	” and then , going out upon the door - step , pulled the little Midshipman ’s nose as a parting indignity , and went away down the street grinning triumphantly . The Captain , left to himself , resumed his perusal of the news as if nothing unusual or unexpected had taken place , and went reading on with the greatest assiduity . But never a word did Captain Cuttle understand , though he read a vast number , for Rob the Grinder was scampering up one column and down another all through the newspaper . It is doubtful whether the worthy Captain had ever felt himself quite abandoned until now ; but now , old Sol Gills , Walter , and Heart ’s Delight were lost to him indeed , and now Mr Carker deceived and jeered him cruelly . They were all represented in the false Rob , to whom he had held forth many a time on the recollections that were warm within him ; he had believed in the false Rob , and had been glad to believe in him ; he had made a companion of him as the last of the old ship ’s company ; he had taken the command of the little Midshipman with him at his right hand ; he had meant to do his duty by him , and had felt almost as kindly towards the boy as if they had been shipwrecked and cast upon a desert place together . And now , that the false Rob had brought distrust , treachery , and meanness into the very parlour , which was a kind of sacred place , Captain Cuttle felt as if the parlour might have gone down next , and not surprised him much by its sinking , or given him any very great concern . Therefore Captain Cuttle read the newspaper with profound attention and no comprehension , and therefore Captain Cuttle said nothing whatever about Rob to himself , or admitted to himself that he was thinking about him , or would recognise in the most distant manner that Rob had anything to do with his feeling as lonely as Robinson Crusoe . In the same composed , business - like way , the Captain stepped over to Leadenhall Market in the dusk , and effected an arrangement with a private watchman on duty there , to come and put up and take down the shutters of the wooden Midshipman every night and morning . He then called in at the eating - house to diminish by one half the daily rations theretofore supplied to the Midshipman , and at the public - house to stop the traitor ’s beer . “
278566	278581	278562	278564	My young man	6464	” said the Captain , in explanation to the young lady at the bar , “
278590	279026	279027	279027	He	6466	” Lastly , the Captain resolved to take possession of the bed under the counter , and to turn in there o ’ nights instead of upstairs , as sole guardian of the property . From this bed Captain Cuttle daily rose thenceforth , and clapped on his glazed hat at six o’clock in the morning , with the solitary air of Crusoe finishing his toilet with his goat - skin cap ; and although his fears of a visitation from the savage tribe , MacStinger , were somewhat cooled , as similar apprehensions on the part of that lone mariner used to be by the lapse of a long interval without any symptoms of the cannibals , he still observed a regular routine of defensive operations , and never encountered a bonnet without previous survey from his castle of retreat . In the meantime ( during which he received no call from Mr Toots , who wrote to say he was out of town ) his own voice began to have a strange sound in his ears ; and he acquired such habits of profound meditation from much polishing and stowing away of the stock , and from much sitting behind the counter reading , or looking out of window , that the red rim made on his forehead by the hard glazed hat , sometimes ached again with excess of reflection . The year being now expired , Captain Cuttle deemed it expedient to open the packet ; but as he had always designed doing this in the presence of Rob the Grinder , who had brought it to him , and as he had an idea that it would be regular and ship - shape to open it in the presence of somebody , he was sadly put to it for want of a witness . In this difficulty , he hailed one day with unusual delight the announcement in the Shipping Intelligence of the arrival of the Cautious Clara , Captain John Bunsby , from a coasting voyage ; and to that philosopher immediately dispatched a letter by post , enjoining inviolable secrecy as to his place of residence , and requesting to be favoured with an early visit , in the evening season . Bunsby , who was one of those sages who act upon conviction , took some days to get the conviction thoroughly into his mind , that he had received a letter to this effect . But when he had grappled with the fact , and mastered it , he promptly sent his boy with the message , “
279033	279179	279180	279180	Bunsby	460	” Who being instructed to deliver those words and disappear , fulfilled his mission like a tarry spirit , charged with a mysterious warning . The Captain , well pleased to receive it , made preparation of pipes and rum and water , and awaited his visitor in the back parlour . At the hour of eight , a deep lowing , as of a nautical Bull , outside the shop - door , succeeded by the knocking of a stick on the panel , announced to the listening ear of Captain Cuttle , that Bunsby was alongside ; whom he instantly admitted , shaggy and loose , and with his stolid mahogany visage , as usual , appearing to have no consciousness of anything before it , but to be attentively observing something that was taking place in quite another part of the world . “
279182	279193	279180	279180	Bunsby	460	” said the Captain , grasping him by the hand , “
279203	279204	279205	279205	Shipmet	4257	” “
279207	279226	279205	279205	Shipmet	4257	” replied the voice within Bunsby , unaccompanied by any sign on the part of the Commander himself , “
279231	279232	279233	279233	Bunsby	460	” “
279235	279247	279233	279233	Bunsby	460	” said the Captain , rendering irrepressible homage to his genius , “
279325	279332	279303	279313	a man as gave an opinion in this here very place	6471	” which the Captain sincerely believed . “
279337	279341	279303	279313	a man as gave an opinion in this here very place	6471	” growled Bunsby . “
279345	279350	279303	279313	a man as gave an opinion in this here very place	6471	” said the Captain . “
279354	279367	279303	279313	a man as gave an opinion in this here very place	6471	” growled Bunsby , looking at his friend for the first time . “
279379	279648	279303	279313	a man as gave an opinion in this here very place	6471	” With these oracular words — they seemed almost to make the Captain giddy ; they launched him upon such a sea of speculation and conjecture — the sage submitted to be helped off with his pilot - coat , and accompanied his friend into the back parlour , where his hand presently alighted on the rum - bottle , from which he brewed a stiff glass of grog ; and presently afterwards on a pipe , which he filled , lighted , and began to smoke . Captain Cuttle , imitating his visitor in the matter of these particulars , though the rapt and imperturbable manner of the great Commander was far above his powers , sat in the opposite corner of the fireside , observing him respectfully , and as if he waited for some encouragement or expression of curiosity on Bunsby ’s part which should lead him to his own affairs . But as the mahogany philosopher gave no evidence of being sentient of anything but warmth and tobacco , except once , when taking his pipe from his lips to make room for his glass , he incidentally remarked with exceeding gruffness , that his name was Jack Bunsby — a declaration that presented but small opening for conversation — the Captain bespeaking his attention in a short complimentary exordium , narrated the whole history of Uncle Sol ’s departure , with the change it had produced in his own life and fortunes ; and concluded by placing the packet on the table . After a long pause , Mr Bunsby nodded his head . “
279651	279685	279303	279313	a man as gave an opinion in this here very place	6471	” said the Captain . Bunsby nodded again . The Captain accordingly broke the seal , and disclosed to view two folded papers , of which he severally read the endorsements , thus : “
279694	279695	279691	279692	Solomon Gills	248	” “
279701	279735	279303	279313	a man as gave an opinion in this here very place	6471	” Bunsby , with his eye on the coast of Greenland , seemed to listen for the contents . The Captain therefore hemmed to clear his throat , and read the letter aloud . “
279752	279773	279303	279313	a man as gave an opinion in this here very place	6471	” Here the Captain stopped , and looked hard at Bunsby , who looked fixedly at the coast of Greenland . “
279901	279909	280027	280027	Physicians	560	” said Captain Cuttle , sorrowfully meditating ; “
279921	279934	279914	279914	he	13174	” Mr Bunsby , who had a musical ear , suddenly bellowed , “
279943	279977	279914	279914	he	13174	” which so affected the good Captain , as an appropriate tribute to departed worth , that he shook him by the hand in acknowledgment , and was fain to wipe his eyes . “
279982	280004	279914	279914	he	13174	” said the Captain with a sigh , as the Lament of Bunsby ceased to ring and vibrate in the skylight . “
280025	280026	280027	280027	Physicians	560	” “
280029	280033	280027	280027	Physicians	560	” observed Bunsby , “
280038	280039	280027	280027	Physicians	560	” “
280048	280053	280027	280027	Physicians	560	” said the Captain , “
280071	280081	280027	280027	Physicians	560	” Then , returning to the letter , he read on:—“"But
280094	280106	280027	280027	Physicians	560	” the Captain involuntarily looked round , and shook his head ; “
280119	280127	280027	280027	Physicians	560	” the Captain shook his head again ; “
280226	280236	280239	280239	you	559	” said the Captain , appealing to him solemnly , “
280286	280287	280280	280280	you	559	” “
280292	280300	280302	280302	he	13174	” returned Bunsby , with unusual promptitude , “
280355	280356	280357	280357	Bunsby	559	” “
280359	280395	280396	280396	Bunsby	559	” said Captain Cuttle , who would seem to have estimated the value of his distinguished friend ’s opinions in proportion to the immensity of the difficulty he experienced in making anything out of them ; “
280398	280408	280409	280409	you	559	” said the Captain , quite confounded by admiration , “
280529	281164	280526	280527	Ed’ard Cuttle	531	” Bunsby , descrying no objection , on the coast of Greenland or elsewhere , to this proposal , it was carried into execution ; and that great man , bringing his eye into the present for a moment , affixed his sign - manual to the cover , totally abstaining , with characteristic modesty , from the use of capital letters . Captain Cuttle , having attached his own left - handed signature , and locked up the packet in the iron safe , entreated his guest to mix another glass and smoke another pipe ; and doing the like himself , fell a musing over the fire on the possible fortunes of the poor old Instrument - maker . And now a surprise occurred , so overwhelming and terrific that Captain Cuttle , unsupported by the presence of Bunsby , must have sunk beneath it , and been a lost man from that fatal hour . How the Captain , even in the satisfaction of admitting such a guest , could have only shut the door , and not locked it , of which negligence he was undoubtedly guilty , is one of those questions that must for ever remain mere points of speculation , or vague charges against destiny . But by that unlocked door , at this quiet moment , did the fell MacStinger dash into the parlour , bringing Alexander MacStinger in her parental arms , and confusion and vengeance ( not to mention Juliana MacStinger , and the sweet child ’s brother , Charles MacStinger , popularly known about the scenes of his youthful sports , as Chowley ) in her train . She came so swiftly and so silently , like a rushing air from the neighbourhood of the East India Docks , that Captain Cuttle found himself in the very act of sitting looking at her , before the calm face with which he had been meditating , changed to one of horror and dismay . But the moment Captain Cuttle understood the full extent of his misfortune , self - preservation dictated an attempt at flight . Darting at the little door which opened from the parlour on the steep little range of cellar - steps , the Captain made a rush , head - foremost , at the latter , like a man indifferent to bruises and contusions , who only sought to hide himself in the bowels of the earth . In this gallant effort he would probably have succeeded , but for the affectionate dispositions of Juliana and Chowley , who pinning him by the legs — one of those dear children holding on to each — claimed him as their friend , with lamentable cries . In the meantime , Mrs MacStinger , who never entered upon any action of importance without previously inverting Alexander MacStinger , to bring him within the range of a brisk battery of slaps , and then sitting him down to cool as the reader first beheld him , performed that solemn rite , as if on this occasion it were a sacrifice to the Furies ; and having deposited the victim on the floor , made at the Captain with a strength of purpose that appeared to threaten scratches to the interposing Bunsby . The cries of the two elder MacStingers , and the wailing of young Alexander , who may be said to have passed a piebald childhood , forasmuch as he was black in the face during one half of that fairy period of existence , combined to make this visitation the more awful . But when silence reigned again , and the Captain , in a violent perspiration , stood meekly looking at Mrs MacStinger , its terrors were at their height . “
281173	281206	281209	281210	Cap’en Cuttle	394	” said Mrs MacStinger , making her chin rigid , and shaking it in unison with what , but for the weakness of her sex , might be described as her fist . “
281234	281246	281216	281216	you	394	” The Captain , who looked anything but daring , feebly muttered “
281250	281251	281216	281216	you	394	” “
281274	281279	281268	281269	Cap’en Cuttle	394	” cried Mrs MacStinger . “
281348	281370	281372	281372	they	6496	muzzlings”—Mrs MacStinger used the last word for the joint sake of alliteration and aggravation , rather than for the expression of any idea—“and
281459	281485	281487	281487	he	2915	” Mrs MacStinger stopped to fetch her breath ; and her face flushed with triumph in this second happy introduction of Captain Cuttle ’s muzzlings . “
281497	281523	281487	281487	he	2915	” cried Mrs MacStinger , with a lengthening out of the last syllable that made the unfortunate Captain regard himself as the meanest of men ; “
281555	281560	281541	281541	He	2915	” long syllable again ; “
281577	281586	281572	281575	that baby of mine	6502	” said Mrs MacStinger , with sudden rapidity , “
281614	281700	281701	281706	A pretty sort of a man	6504	” [ Illustration ] The young Alexander , interpreting this into a positive promise , to be shortly redeemed , tumbled over with fear and grief , and lay upon the floor , exhibiting the soles of his shoes and making such a deafening outcry , that Mrs MacStinger found it necessary to take him up in her arms , where she quieted him , ever and anon , as he broke out again , by a shake that seemed enough to loosen his teeth . “
281711	281730	281701	281706	A pretty sort of a man	6504	” said Mrs MacStinger , with a sharp stress on the first syllable of the Captain ’s name , “
281815	281829	281812	281813	Cap’en Cuttle	394	” said Mrs MacStinger , with severe reaction in her voice and manner , “
281842	281869	281870	281871	Cap’en Cuttle	394	” The frightened Captain looked into his hat , as if he saw nothing for it but to put it on , and give himself up . “
281873	281884	281870	281871	Cap’en Cuttle	394	” repeated Mrs MacStinger , in the same determined manner , “
281899	281916	281897	281897	Sir	735	” The Captain seemed quite ready to go , but faintly suggested something to the effect of “
281925	281926	281897	281897	Sir	735	” “
281933	281942	281897	281897	Sir	735	” said Bunsby , in a soothing tone . “
281950	281951	281897	281897	Sir	735	” “
281962	281971	281959	281959	you	6508	” retorted Mrs MacStinger , with chaste loftiness . “
282033	282034	282031	282031	Sir	735	” “
282046	282200	282201	282201	Cuttle	392	” said Bunsby . Captain Cuttle could hardly believe it , even of this great man , though he saw it done with his waking eyes ; but Bunsby , advancing boldly , put his shaggy blue arm round Mrs MacStinger , and so softened her by his magic way of doing it , and by these few words — he said no more — that she melted into tears , after looking upon him for a few moments , and observed that a child might conquer her now , she was so low in her courage . Speechless and utterly amazed , the Captain saw him gradually persuade this inexorable woman into the shop , return for rum and water and a candle , take them to her , and pacify her without appearing to utter one word . Presently he looked in with his pilot - coat on , and said , “
282214	282823	282824	282824	Cuttle	392	” and Captain Cuttle , more to his confusion than if he had been put in irons himself , for safe transport to Brig Place , saw the family pacifically filing off , with Mrs MacStinger at their head . He had scarcely time to take down his canister , and stealthily convey some money into the hands of Juliana MacStinger , his former favourite , and Chowley , who had the claim upon him that he was naturally of a maritime build , before the Midshipman was abandoned by them all ; and Bunsby whispering that he ’d carry on smart , and hail Ned Cuttle again before he went aboard , shut the door upon himself , as the last member of the party . Some uneasy ideas that he must be walking in his sleep , or that he had been troubled with phantoms , and not a family of flesh and blood , beset the Captain at first , when he went back to the little parlour , and found himself alone . Illimitable faith in , and immeasurable admiration of , the Commander of the Cautious Clara , succeeded , and threw the Captain into a wondering trance . Still , as time wore on , and Bunsby failed to reappear , the Captain began to entertain uncomfortable doubts of another kind . Whether Bunsby had been artfully decoyed to Brig Place , and was there detained in safe custody as hostage for his friend ; in which case it would become the Captain , as a man of honour , to release him , by the sacrifice of his own liberty . Whether he had been attacked and defeated by Mrs MacStinger , and was ashamed to show himself after his discomfiture . Whether Mrs MacStinger , thinking better of it , in the uncertainty of her temper , had turned back to board the Midshipman again , and Bunsby , pretending to conduct her by a short cut , was endeavouring to lose the family amid the wilds and savage places of the City . Above all , what it would behove him , Captain Cuttle , to do , in case of his hearing no more , either of the MacStingers or of Bunsby , which , in these wonderful and unforeseen conjunctions of events , might possibly happen . He debated all this until he was tired ; and still no Bunsby . He made up his bed under the counter , all ready for turning in ; and still no Bunsby . At length , when the Captain had given him up , for that night at least , and had begun to undress , the sound of approaching wheels was heard , and , stopping at the door , was succeeded by Bunsby ’s hail . The Captain trembled to think that Mrs MacStinger was not to be got rid of , and had been brought back in a coach . But no . Bunsby was accompanied by nothing but a large box , which he hauled into the shop with his own hands , and as soon as he had hauled in , sat upon . Captain Cuttle knew it for the chest he had left at Mrs MacStinger ’s house , and looking , candle in hand , at Bunsby more attentively , believed that he was three sheets in the wind , or , in plain words , drunk . It was difficult , however , to be sure of this ; the Commander having no trace of expression in his face when sober . “
282826	282841	282824	282824	Cuttle	392	” said the Commander , getting off the chest , and opening the lid , “
282848	282858	282845	282845	your	392	” Captain Cuttle looked in and identified his property . “
282869	283473	283474	283475	Mr Dombey	533	” said Bunsby . The grateful and bewildered Captain grasped him by the hand , and was launching into a reply expressive of his astonished feelings , when Bunsby disengaged himself by a jerk of his wrist , and seemed to make an effort to wink with his revolving eye , the only effect of which attempt , in his condition , was nearly to over - balance him . He then abruptly opened the door , and shot away to rejoin the Cautious Clara with all speed — supposed to be his invariable custom , whenever he considered he had made a point . As it was not his humour to be often sought , Captain Cuttle decided not to go or send to him next day , or until he should make his gracious pleasure known in such wise , or failing that , until some little time should have lapsed . The Captain , therefore , renewed his solitary life next morning , and thought profoundly , many mornings , noons , and nights , of old Sol Gills , and Bunsby ’s sentiments concerning him , and the hopes there were of his return . Much of such thinking strengthened Captain Cuttle ’s hopes ; and he humoured them and himself by watching for the Instrument - maker at the door — as he ventured to do now , in his strange liberty — and setting his chair in its place , and arranging the little parlour as it used to be , in case he should come home unexpectedly . He likewise , in his thoughtfulness , took down a certain little miniature of Walter as a schoolboy , from its accustomed nail , lest it should shock the old man on his return . The Captain had his presentiments , too , sometimes , that he would come on such a day ; and one particular Sunday , even ordered a double allowance of dinner , he was so sanguine . But come , old Solomon did not ; and still the neighbours noticed how the seafaring man in the glazed hat , stood at the shop - door of an evening , looking up and down the street . CHAPTER XL . Domestic Relations It was not in the nature of things that a man of Mr Dombey ’s mood , opposed to such a spirit as he had raised against himself , should be softened in the imperious asperity of his temper ; or that the cold hard armour of pride in which he lived encased , should be made more flexible by constant collision with haughty scorn and defiance . It is the curse of such a nature — it is a main part of the heavy retribution on itself it bears within itself — that while deference and concession swell its evil qualities , and are the food it grows upon , resistance and a questioning of its exacting claims , foster it too , no less . The evil that is in it finds equally its means of growth and propagation in opposites . It draws support and life from sweets and bitters ; bowed down before , or unacknowledged , it still enslaves the breast in which it has its throne ; and , worshipped or rejected , is as hard a master as the Devil in dark fables . Towards his first wife , Mr Dombey , in his cold and lofty arrogance , had borne himself like the removed Being he almost conceived himself to be . He had been “
283476	283488	283489	283490	Mr Dombey	533	” with her when she first saw him , and he was “
283491	284698	284699	284700	Mrs Dombey	186	” when she died . He had asserted his greatness during their whole married life , and she had meekly recognised it . He had kept his distant seat of state on the top of his throne , and she her humble station on its lowest step ; and much good it had done him , so to live in solitary bondage to his one idea . He had imagined that the proud character of his second wife would have been added to his own — would have merged into it , and exalted his greatness . He had pictured himself haughtier than ever , with Edith ’s haughtiness subservient to his . He had never entertained the possibility of its arraying itself against him . And now , when he found it rising in his path at every step and turn of his daily life , fixing its cold , defiant , and contemptuous face upon him , this pride of his , instead of withering , or hanging down its head beneath the shock , put forth new shoots , became more concentrated and intense , more gloomy , sullen , irksome , and unyielding , than it had ever been before . Who wears such armour , too , bears with him ever another heavy retribution . It is of proof against conciliation , love , and confidence ; against all gentle sympathy from without , all trust , all tenderness , all soft emotion ; but to deep stabs in the self - love , it is as vulnerable as the bare breast to steel ; and such tormenting festers rankle there , as follow on no other wounds , no , though dealt with the mailed hand of Pride itself , on weaker pride , disarmed and thrown down . Such wounds were his . He felt them sharply , in the solitude of his old rooms ; whither he now began often to retire again , and pass long solitary hours . It seemed his fate to be ever proud and powerful ; ever humbled and powerless where he would be most strong . Who seemed fated to work out that doom ? Who ? Who was it who could win his wife as she had won his boy ? Who was it who had shown him that new victory , as he sat in the dark corner ? Who was it whose least word did what his utmost means could not ? Who was it who , unaided by his love , regard or notice , thrived and grew beautiful when those so aided died ? Who could it be , but the same child at whom he had often glanced uneasily in her motherless infancy , with a kind of dread , lest he might come to hate her ; and of whom his foreboding was fulfilled , for he DID hate her in his heart ? Yes , and he would have it hatred , and he made it hatred , though some sparkles of the light in which she had appeared before him on the memorable night of his return home with his Bride , occasionally hung about her still . He knew now that she was beautiful ; he did not dispute that she was graceful and winning , and that in the bright dawn of her womanhood she had come upon him , a surprise . But he turned even this against her . In his sullen and unwholesome brooding , the unhappy man , with a dull perception of his alienation from all hearts , and a vague yearning for what he had all his life repelled , made a distorted picture of his rights and wrongs , and justified himself with it against her . The worthier she promised to be of him , the greater claim he was disposed to antedate upon her duty and submission . When had she ever shown him duty and submission ? Did she grace his life — or Edith ’s ? Had her attractions been manifested first to him — or Edith ? Why , he and she had never been , from her birth , like father and child ! They had always been estranged . She had crossed him every way and everywhere . She was leagued against him now . Her very beauty softened natures that were obdurate to him , and insulted him with an unnatural triumph . It may have been that in all this there were mutterings of an awakened feeling in his breast , however selfishly aroused by his position of disadvantage , in comparison with what she might have made his life . But he silenced the distant thunder with the rolling of his sea of pride . He would bear nothing but his pride . And in his pride , a heap of inconsistency , and misery , and self - inflicted torment , he hated her . To the moody , stubborn , sullen demon , that possessed him , his wife opposed her different pride in its full force . They never could have led a happy life together ; but nothing could have made it more unhappy , than the wilful and determined warfare of such elements . His pride was set upon maintaining his magnificent supremacy , and forcing recognition of it from her . She would have been racked to death , and turned but her haughty glance of calm inflexible disdain upon him , to the last . Such recognition from Edith ! He little knew through what a storm and struggle she had been driven onward to the crowning honour of his hand . He little knew how much she thought she had conceded , when she suffered him to call her wife . Mr Dombey was resolved to show her that he was supreme . There must be no will but his . Proud he desired that she should be , but she must be proud for , not against him . As he sat alone , hardening , he would often hear her go out and come home , treading the round of London life with no more heed of his liking or disliking , pleasure or displeasure , than if he had been her groom . Her cold supreme indifference — his own unquestioned attribute usurped — stung him more than any other kind of treatment could have done ; and he determined to bend her to his magnificent and stately will . He had been long communing with these thoughts , when one night he sought her in her own apartment , after he had heard her return home late . She was alone , in her brilliant dress , and had but that moment come from her mother ’s room . Her face was melancholy and pensive , when he came upon her ; but it marked him at the door ; for , glancing at the mirror before it , he saw immediately , as in a picture - frame , the knitted brow , and darkened beauty that he knew so well . “
284702	284708	284699	284700	Mrs Dombey	186	” he said , entering , “
284721	284722	284709	284709	I	0	” “
284727	284731	284709	284709	I	0	” she replied . “
284742	284746	284747	284747	You	186	” he returned . “
284783	284784	284785	284785	I	0	” “
284788	284792	284785	284785	I	0	” she answered , “
284800	285114	285115	285116	Mrs Dombey	186	” She looked upon him as she said so , and folding her white arms , sparkling with gold and gems , upon her swelling breast , turned away her eyes . If she had been less handsome , and less stately in her cold composure , she might not have had the power of impressing him with the sense of disadvantage that penetrated through his utmost pride . But she had the power , and he felt it keenly . He glanced round the room : saw how the splendid means of personal adornment , and the luxuries of dress , were scattered here and there , and disregarded ; not in mere caprice and carelessness ( or so he thought ) , but in a steadfast haughty disregard of costly things : and felt it more and more . Chaplets of flowers , plumes of feathers , jewels , laces , silks and satins ; look where he would , he saw riches , despised , poured out , and made of no account . The very diamonds — a marriage gift — that rose and fell impatiently upon her bosom , seemed to pant to break the chain that clasped them round her neck , and roll down on the floor where she might tread upon them . He felt his disadvantage , and he showed it . Solemn and strange among this wealth of colour and voluptuous glitter , strange and constrained towards its haughty mistress , whose repellent beauty it repeated , and presented all around him , as in so many fragments of a mirror , he was conscious of embarrassment and awkwardness . Nothing that ministered to her disdainful self - possession could fail to gall him . Galled and irritated with himself , he sat down , and went on , in no improved humour : “
285142	285169	285170	285170	I	0	” She merely glanced at him again , and again averted her eyes ; but she might have spoken for an hour , and expressed less . “
285200	285201	285202	285202	You	186	” “
285235	285236	285229	285229	You	186	” “
285239	285252	285237	285237	Madam	3633	” said Mr Dombey , with his most offensive air of state , “
285314	285315	285296	285296	I	0	” “
285328	285356	285325	285325	she	3633	“ Possibly I may think that my wife should partake — or does partake , and can not help herself — of both characters , Mrs Dombey . ”
285442	285450	285452	285453	Mr Dombey	533	“ You are too expensive , Madam , ”
285455	285580	285452	285453	Mr Dombey	533	“ You are extravagant . You waste a great deal of money — or what would be a great deal in the pockets of most gentlemen — in cultivating a kind of society that is useless to me , and , indeed , that upon the whole is disagreeable to me . I have to insist upon a total change in all these respects . I know that in the novelty of possessing a tithe of such means as Fortune has placed at your disposal , ladies are apt to run into a sudden extreme . There has been more than enough of that extreme . I beg that Mrs Granger ’s very different experiences may now come to the instruction of Mrs Dombey . ”
285704	285712	285714	285715	Mr Dombey	533	“ You will further please , Madam , ”
285724	285817	285818	285818	he	533	“ to understand distinctly , that I am to be deferred to and obeyed . That I must have a positive show and confession of deference before the world , Madam . I am used to this . I require it as my right . In short I will have it . I consider it no unreasonable return for the worldly advancement that has befallen you ; and I believe nobody will be surprised , either at its being required from you , or at your making it.—To Me — To Me ! ”
285839	285850	285852	285853	Mr Dombey	533	“ I have learnt from your mother , Mrs Dombey , ”
285859	285883	285852	285853	Mr Dombey	533	“ what no doubt you know , namely , that Brighton is recommended for her health . Mr Carker has been so good . ”
285926	286035	285922	285923	Mr Dombey	533	“ Mr Carker has been so good as to go down and secure a house there , for a time . On the return of the establishment to London , I shall take such steps for its better management as I consider necessary . One of these , will be the engagement at Brighton ( if it is to be effected ) , of a very respectable reduced person there , a Mrs Pipchin , formerly employed in a situation of trust in my family , to act as housekeeper . An establishment like this , presided over but nominally , Mrs Dombey , requires a competent head . ”
286099	286103	286105	286106	Mr Dombey—“and	566	“ I observed , ”
286106	286232	286234	286235	Mr Dombey	533	Dombey—“and this concludes what I deem it necessary to say to you at present , Mrs Dombey — I observed a moment ago , Madam , that my allusion to Mr Carker was received in a peculiar manner . On the occasion of my happening to point out to you , before that confidential agent , the objection I had to your mode of receiving my visitors , you were pleased to object to his presence . You will have to get the better of that objection , Madam , and to accustom yourself to it very probably on many similar occasions ; unless you adopt the remedy which is in your own hands , of giving me no cause of complaint . Mr Carker , ”
286279	286307	286308	286308	he	533	“ Mr Carker being in my confidence , Mrs Dombey , may very well be in yours to such an extent . I hope , Mrs Dombey , ”
286331	286405	286308	286308	he	533	“ I may not find it necessary ever to entrust Mr Carker with any message of objection or remonstrance to you ; but as it would be derogatory to my position and reputation to be frequently holding trivial disputes with a lady upon whom I have conferred the highest distinction that it is in my power to bestow , I shall not scruple to avail myself of his services if I see occasion . ”
286406	286410	286411	286411	he	533	“ And now , ”
286431	286439	286411	286411	he	533	“ she knows me and my resolution . ”
286474	286488	286456	286456	she	6533	“ Wait ! For God ’s sake ! I must speak to you . ”
286554	286605	286517	286517	she	6533	“ Did I ever tempt you to seek my hand ? Did I ever use any art to win you ? Was I ever more conciliating to you when you pursued me , than I have been since our marriage ? Was I ever other to you than I am ? ”
286606	286614	286616	286617	Mr Dombey	533	“ It is wholly unnecessary , Madam , ”
286619	286626	286616	286617	Mr Dombey	533	“ to enter upon such discussions . ”
286627	286682	286517	286517	she	6533	“ Did you think I loved you ? Did you know I did not ? Did you ever care , Man ! for my heart , or propose to yourself to win the worthless thing ? Was there any poor pretence of any in our bargain ? Upon your side , or on mine ? ”
286683	286687	286689	286690	Mr Dombey	533	“ These questions , ”
286692	286702	286689	286690	Mr Dombey	533	“ are all wide of the purpose , Madam . ”
286731	286822	286718	286718	her	6534	“ You answer each of them . You answer me before I speak , I see . How can you help it ; you who know the miserable truth as well as I ? Now , tell me . If I loved you to devotion , could I do more than render up my whole will and being to you , as you have just demanded ? If my heart were pure and all untried , and you its idol , could you ask more ; could you have more ? ”
286823	286829	286830	286830	he	6535	“ Possibly not , Madam , ”
286834	286867	286830	286830	he	6535	“ You know how different I am . You see me looking on you now , and you can read the warmth of passion for you that is breathing in my face . ”
286897	286929	286935	286935	he	533	“ You know my general history . You have spoken of my mother . Do you think you can degrade , or bend or break , me to submission and obedience ? ”
286952	286960	286961	286961	she	6536	“ If there is anything unusual here , ”
286990	287000	286961	286961	she	6536	“ as I know there are unusual feelings here , ”
287015	287040	287041	287041	she	6536	“ consider that there is no common meaning in the appeal I am going to make you . Yes , for I am going ; ”
287054	287060	287041	287041	she	6536	“ to appeal to you . ”
287095	287107	287109	287109	he	533	“ If you can believe that I am of such a nature now,”—he
287145	287218	287139	287139	she	6536	ever,—“as would make what I now say almost incredible to myself , said to any man who had become my husband , but , above all , said to you , you may , perhaps , attach the greater weight to it . In the dark end to which we are tending , and may come , we shall not involve ourselves alone ( that might not be much ) but others . ”
287233	287353	287221	287221	He	533	“ I speak to you for the sake of others . Also your own sake ; and for mine . Since our marriage , you have been arrogant to me ; and I have repaid you in kind . You have shown to me and everyone around us , every day and hour , that you think I am graced and distinguished by your alliance . I do not think so , and have shown that too . It seems you do not understand , or ( so far as your power can go ) intend that each of us shall take a separate course ; and you expect from me instead , a homage you will never have . ”
287368	287370	287502	287502	her	6538	“ Never ”
287378	287462	287463	287464	Mr Dombey	533	“ I feel no tenderness towards you ; that you know . You would care nothing for it , if I did or could . I know as well that you feel none towards me . But we are linked together ; and in the knot that ties us , as I have said , others are bound up . We must both die ; we are both connected with the dead already , each by a little child . Let us forbear . ”
287483	287489	287490	287490	she	6538	“ There is no wealth , ”
287512	287670	287490	287490	she	6538	“ that could buy these words of me , and the meaning that belongs to them . Once cast away as idle breath , no wealth or power can bring them back . I mean them ; I have weighed them ; and I will be true to what I undertake . If you will promise to forbear on your part , I will promise to forbear on mine . We are a most unhappy pair , in whom , from different causes , every sentiment that blesses marriage , or justifies it , is rooted out ; but in the course of time , some friendship , or some fitness for each other , may arise between us . I will try to hope so , if you will make the endeavour too ; and I will look forward to a better and a happier use of age than I have made of youth or prime . ”
287719	287722	287724	287725	Mr Dombey	533	“ Madam , ”
287732	287744	287745	287745	She	6538	“ I can not entertain any proposal of this extraordinary nature . ”
287756	287761	287763	287764	Mr Dombey	533	“ I can not , ”

There ’s a Mausoleum down at my place , in the park , but I ’m afraid it ’s in bad repair , and , in point of fact , in a devil of a state . But for being a little out at elbows , I should have had it put to rights ; but I believe the people come and make pic - nic parties there inside the iron railings . ”
296303	296314	296316	296317	Cousin Feenix	442	“ There ’s an uncommon good church in the village , ”
296321	296364	296316	296317	Cousin Feenix	442	“ pure specimen of the Anglo - Norman style , and admirably well sketched too by Lady Jane Finchbury — woman with tight stays — but they ’ve spoilt it with whitewash , I understand , and it ’s a long journey . ”
296365	296370	296371	296372	Mr Dombey	533	“ Perhaps Brighton itself , ”
296375	296391	296393	296394	Cousin Feenix	442	“ Upon my honour , Dombey , I do n’t think we could do better , ”
296396	296412	296393	296394	Cousin Feenix	442	“ It ’s on the spot , you see , and a very cheerful place . ”
296413	296417	296419	296420	Mr Dombey	533	“ And when , ”
296422	296428	296419	296420	Mr Dombey	533	“ would it be convenient ? ”
296429	296436	296438	296439	Cousin Feenix	442	“ I shall make a point , ”
296441	296484	296486	296487	Cousin Feenix	442	“ of pledging myself for any day you think best . I shall have great pleasure ( melancholy pleasure , of course ) in following my poor aunt to the confines of the — in point of fact , to the grave , ”
296497	296505	296507	296508	Mr Dombey	533	“ Would Monday do for leaving town ? ”
296510	296518	296507	296508	Mr Dombey	533	“ Monday would suit me to perfection , ”
296556	296575	296547	296548	Cousin Feenix	442	“ I ’m really excessively sorry , Dombey , that you should have so much trouble about it ; ”
296582	296587	296578	296579	Mr Dombey	533	“ Not at all . ”
296680	296709	296716	296717	Cousin Feenix	442	“ Tom Johnson . Man with cork leg , from White ’s . What , are you here , Tommy ? Foley on a blood mare . The Smalder girls”—and
297539	297544	297546	297547	Mr Carker	533	“ What , scapegrace ! ”
297553	297564	297546	297547	Mr Carker	533	“ Have you left your situation and come to me ? ”
297565	297573	297575	297575	Rob	424	“ Oh if you please , Sir , ”
297577	297590	297575	297575	Rob	424	“ you said , you know , when I come here last — ”
297591	297595	297597	297598	Mr Carker	533	“ I said , ”
297600	297606	297597	297598	Mr Carker	533	“ what did I say ? ”
297607	297624	297626	297626	Rob	424	“ If you please , Sir , you did n’t say nothing at all , Sir , ”
297660	297684	297655	297655	his	12854	“ You ’ll come to an evil end , my vagabond friend , I foresee . There ’s ruin in store for you . “
297695	297706	297693	297693	Sir	735	” cried Rob , with his legs trembling under him . “
297742	297743	297740	297740	Sir	735	” “
297754	297759	297750	297750	you	0	” returned his patron , “
297769	297770	297761	297761	you	0	” “
297779	297785	297777	297777	Sir	735	” pleaded the submissive Rob ; “
297831	297832	297833	297833	You	735	” “
297836	297853	297833	297833	You	735	” said Mr Carker , leaning back in his chair , and smiling at him serenely . “
297872	297873	297876	297876	Sir	735	” “
297878	297884	297876	297876	Sir	735	” replied the abject Grinder , “
297920	297961	297909	297909	Sir	735	” Thoroughly checked in his expectations of commendation , the crestfallen Grinder stood looking at his patron , and vainly endeavouring not to look at him , with the uneasiness which a cur will often manifest in a similar situation . “
297984	297989	297963	297963	you	735	” said Mr Carker . “
297998	298030	297963	297963	you	735	” returned Rob , who , in doing so , had acted on his patron ’s own instructions , but dared not justify himself by the least insinuation to that effect . “
298033	298038	297963	297963	you	735	” said Mr Carker . “
298045	298046	297963	297963	you	735	” “
298055	298084	298053	298053	Sir	735	” returned Rob , tumbling with his hat , and still fixed by Mr Carker ’s eye , and fruitlessly endeavouring to unfix himself . Mr Carker nodded . “
298090	298134	298135	298135	Halloa	249	” Rob expressed in a number of short bows his lively understanding of this caution , and was bowing himself back to the door , greatly relieved by the prospect of getting on the outside of it , when his patron stopped him . “
298137	298146	298147	298147	You	249	” he cried , calling him roughly back . “
298155	298168	298147	298147	You	249	” Rob obeyed as if his life had depended on his alacrity . “
298185	298186	298179	298179	you	249	” “
298191	298204	298189	298189	Sir	735	” Rob hazarded , after some embarrassed reflection . His patron nodded . “
298212	298213	298214	298214	I	0	” “
298225	298229	298214	298214	I	0	” answered Rob ; “
298291	298292	298289	298289	Sir	735	” “
298297	298310	298312	298313	his patron	12854	” You have been used , too , to babbling and tattling , ”
298318	298331	298333	298333	he	12854	“ Beware of that here , or you ’re a lost rascal , ”
298518	298523	298525	298525	Carker	533	“ I never thought , ”
298538	298586	298528	298528	he	533	“ to see you here , I ’m sure . This is an extraordinary day in my calendar . No occasion is very special to a man like you , who may do anything ; but to a man like me , the case is widely different . ”
298587	298597	298599	298600	Mr Dombey	533	“ You have a tasteful place here , Carker , ”
298614	298622	298624	298624	Carker	533	“ You can afford to say so , ”
298626	298630	298624	298624	Carker	533	“ Thank you . ”
298631	298634	298636	298637	Mr Dombey	533	“ Indeed , ”
298644	298670	298636	298637	Mr Dombey	533	“ anyone might say so . As far as it goes , it is a very commodious and well - arranged place — quite elegant . ”
298671	298680	298682	298682	Carker	533	“ As far as it goes , truly , ”
298690	298724	298725	298726	Mr Dombey	533	“ It wants that qualification . Well ! we have said enough about it ; and though you can afford to praise it , I thank you nonetheless . Will you walk in ? ”
298819	298840	298841	298841	he	533	“ But perhaps to you , who are so far removed , it really does look better than it is , ”
298854	298866	298867	298867	He	533	“ Just as monarchs imagine attractions in the lives of beggars . ”
299254	299258	299260	299260	Carker	533	“ Allow me , ”
299263	299271	299260	299260	Carker	533	“ to ask how Mrs Dombey is ? ”
299311	299323	299306	299306	he	533	“ Now , see , how I will lead him on ! ”
299331	299355	299328	299328	he	533	“ Mrs Dombey is quite well . You remind me , Carker , of some conversation that I wish to have with you . ”
299356	299364	299366	299367	his master	10140	“ Robin , you can leave us , ”
299389	299400	299401	299401	he	10140	“ You do n’t remember that boy , of course ? ”
299411	299414	299416	299417	Mr Dombey	533	“ No , ”
299423	299436	299438	299438	Carker	533	“ Not likely that a man like you would . Hardly possible , ”
299440	299467	299438	299438	Carker	533	“ But he is one of that family from whom you took a nurse . Perhaps you may remember having generously charged yourself with his education ? ”
299468	299474	299476	299477	Mr Dombey	533	“ Is it that boy ? ”
299483	299495	299476	299477	Mr Dombey	533	“ He does little credit to his education , I believe . ”
299496	299509	299511	299511	Carker	533	“ Why , he is a young rip , I am afraid , ”
299517	299609	299610	299610	He	533	“ He bears that character . But the truth is , I took him into my service because , being able to get no other employment , he conceived ( had been taught at home , I daresay ) that he had some sort of claim upon you , and was constantly trying to dog your heels with his petition . And although my defined and recognised connexion with your affairs is merely of a business character , still I have that spontaneous interest in everything belonging to you , that — ”
299645	299648	299650	299651	Mr Dombey	533	“ Carker , ”
299653	299664	299650	299651	Mr Dombey	533	“ I am sensible that you do not limit your — ”
299665	299668	299670	299670	his	533	“ Service , ”
299674	299684	299686	299687	Mr Dombey	533	“ No ; I prefer to say your regard , ”
299708	299750	299693	299693	he	533	“ to our mere business relations . Your consideration for my feelings , hopes , and disappointments , in the little instance you have just now mentioned , is an example in point . I am obliged to you , Carker . ”
299783	299791	299793	299794	Mr Dombey	533	“ Your allusion to it is opportune , ”
299801	299845	299793	299794	Mr Dombey	533	“ for it prepares the way to what I was beginning to say to you , and reminds me that that involves no absolutely new relations between us , although it may involve more personal confidence on my part than I have hitherto — ”
299846	299851	299853	299853	Carker	533	“ Distinguished me with , ”
299860	299892	299853	299853	Carker	533	“ I will not say to you how honoured I am ; for a man like you well knows how much honour he has in his power to bestow at pleasure . ”
299893	299899	299901	299902	Mr Dombey	533	“ Mrs Dombey and myself , ”
299913	299939	299901	299902	Mr Dombey	533	“ are not quite agreed upon some points . We do not appear to understand each other yet . Mrs Dombey has something to learn . ”
299940	299963	299971	299971	his	533	“ Mrs Dombey is distinguished by many rare attractions ; and has been accustomed , no doubt , to receive much adulation , ”
299977	300001	299965	299975	the smooth , sleek watcher of his slightest look and tone	6859	“ But where there is affection , duty , and respect , any little mistakes engendered by such causes are soon set right . ”
300070	300076	300077	300077	he	533	“ Mrs Dombey and myself , ”
300083	300136	300077	300077	he	533	“ had some discussion , before Mrs Skewton ’s death , upon the causes of my dissatisfaction ; of which you will have formed a general understanding from having been a witness of what passed between Mrs Dombey and myself on the evening when you were at our — at my house . ”
300137	300146	300148	300150	the smiling Carker	533	“ When I so much regretted being present , ”
300152	300232	300148	300150	the smiling Carker	533	“ Proud as a man in my position necessarily must be of your familiar notice — though I give you no credit for it ; you may do anything you please without losing caste — and honoured as I was by an early presentation to Mrs Dombey , before she was made eminent by bearing your name , I almost regretted that night , I assure you , that I had been the object of such especial good fortune . ”
300275	300283	300264	300264	He	533	“ Indeed ! And why , Carker ? ”
300284	300288	300290	300292	the confidential agent	6863	“ I fear , ”
300294	300366	300290	300292	the confidential agent	6863	“ that Mrs Dombey , never very much disposed to regard me with favourable interest — one in my position could not expect that , from a lady naturally proud , and whose pride becomes her so well — may not easily forgive my innocent part in that conversation . Your displeasure is no light matter , you must remember ; and to be visited with it before a third party — ”
300367	300370	300372	300373	Mr Dombey	533	“ Carker , ”
300377	300387	300372	300373	Mr Dombey	533	“ I presume that I am the first consideration ? ”
300388	300399	300401	300402	the other	10537	“ Oh ! Can there be a doubt about it ? ”
300417	300435	300437	300438	Mr Dombey	533	“ Mrs Dombey becomes a secondary consideration , when we are both in question , I imagine , ”
300440	300445	300437	300438	Mr Dombey	533	“ Is that so ? ”
300446	300451	300453	300453	Carker	533	“ Is it so ? ”
300455	300471	300453	300453	Carker	533	“ Do you know better than anyone , that you have no need to ask ? ”
300472	300479	300481	300482	Mr Dombey	533	“ Then I hope , Carker , ”
300484	300512	300481	300482	Mr Dombey	533	“ that your regret in the acquisition of Mrs Dombey ’s displeasure , may be almost counterbalanced by your satisfaction in retaining my confidence and good opinion . ”
300513	300522	300524	300524	Carker	533	“ I have the misfortune , I find , ”
300526	300541	300524	300524	Carker	533	“ to have incurred that displeasure . Mrs Dombey has expressed it to you ? ”
300542	300550	300552	300553	Mr Dombey	533	“ Mrs Dombey has expressed various opinions , ”
300561	300681	300552	300553	Mr Dombey	533	“ in which I do not participate , and which I am not inclined to discuss , or to recall . I made Mrs Dombey acquainted , some time since , as I have already told you , with certain points of domestic deference and submission on which I felt it necessary to insist . I failed to convince Mrs Dombey of the expediency of her immediately altering her conduct in those respects , with a view to her own peace and welfare , and my dignity ; and I informed Mrs Dombey that if I should find it necessary to object or remonstrate again , I should express my opinion to her through yourself , my confidential agent . ”
300713	300718	300720	300721	Mr Dombey	533	“ Now , Carker , ”
300723	300840	300720	300721	Mr Dombey	533	“ I do not hesitate to say to you that I will carry my point . I am not to be trifled with . Mrs Dombey must understand that my will is law , and that I can not allow of one exception to the whole rule of my life . You will have the goodness to undertake this charge , which , coming from me , is not unacceptable to you , I hope , whatever regret you may politely profess — for which I am obliged to you on behalf of Mrs Dombey ; and you will have the goodness , I am persuaded , to discharge it as exactly as any other commission . ”
300841	300845	300847	300848	Mr Carker	533	“ You know , ”
300850	300859	300847	300848	Mr Carker	533	“ that you have only to command me . ”
300860	300864	300866	300867	Mr Dombey	533	“ I know , ”
300876	300910	300866	300867	Mr Dombey	533	“ that I have only to command you . It is necessary that I should proceed in this . Mrs Dombey is a lady undoubtedly highly qualified , in many respects , to — ”
300911	300920	300922	300922	Carker	533	“ To do credit even to your choice , ”
300931	300944	300946	300947	Mr Dombey	533	“ Yes ; if you please to adopt that form of words , ”
300955	301005	301007	301008	Mr Dombey	533	“ and at present I do not conceive that Mrs Dombey does that credit to it , to which it is entitled . There is a principle of opposition in Mrs Dombey that must be eradicated ; that must be overcome : Mrs Dombey does not appear to understand , ”
301012	301025	301007	301008	Mr Dombey	533	“ that the idea of opposition to Me is monstrous and absurd . ”
301026	301037	301039	301039	Carker	533	“ We , in the City , know you better , ”
301049	301055	301057	301058	Mr Dombey	533	“ You know me better , ”
301060	301130	301057	301058	Mr Dombey	533	“ I hope so . Though , indeed , I am bound to do Mrs Dombey the justice of saying , however inconsistent it may seem with her subsequent conduct ( which remains unchanged ) , that on my expressing my disapprobation and determination to her , with some severity , on the occasion to which I have referred , my admonition appeared to produce a very powerful effect . ”
301143	301288	301134	301134	himself	533	“ I wish you to have the goodness , then , to inform Mrs Dombey , Carker , from me , that I must recall our former conversation to her remembrance , in some surprise that it has not yet had its effect . That I must insist upon her regulating her conduct by the injunctions laid upon her in that conversation . That I am not satisfied with her conduct . That I am greatly dissatisfied with it . And that I shall be under the very disagreeable necessity of making you the bearer of yet more unwelcome and explicit communications , if she has not the good sense and the proper feeling to adapt herself to my wishes , as the first Mrs Dombey did , and , I believe I may add , as any other lady in her place would . ”
301289	301298	301300	301300	Carker	533	“ The first Mrs Dombey lived very happily , ”
301302	301312	301314	301315	Mr Dombey	533	“ The first Mrs Dombey had great good sense , ”
301325	301331	301314	301315	Mr Dombey	533	“ and very correct feeling . ”
301332	301344	301346	301346	Carker	533	“ Is Miss Dombey like her mother , do you think ? ”
301365	301373	301374	301374	he	533	“ I have approached a painful subject , ”
301391	301412	301374	301374	he	533	“ Pray forgive me . I forget these chains of association in the interest I have . Pray forgive me . ”
301464	301467	301469	301470	Mr Dombey	533	“ Carker , ”
301497	301540	301469	301470	Mr Dombey	533	“ there is no occasion for apology . You mistake . The association is with the matter in hand , and not with any recollection , as you suppose . I do not approve of Mrs Dombey ’s behaviour towards my daughter . ”
301541	301545	301547	301548	Mr Carker	533	“ Pardon me , ”
301550	301557	301547	301548	Mr Carker	533	“ I do n’t quite understand . ”
301561	301565	301567	301568	Mr Dombey	533	“ Understand then , ”
301570	301784	301786	301787	Mr Dombey	533	“ that you may make that — that you will make that , if you please — matter of direct objection from me to Mrs Dombey . You will please to tell her that her show of devotion for my daughter is disagreeable to me . It is likely to be noticed . It is likely to induce people to contrast Mrs Dombey in her relation towards my daughter , with Mrs Dombey in her relation towards myself . You will have the goodness to let Mrs Dombey know , plainly , that I object to it ; and that I expect her to defer , immediately , to my objection . Mrs Dombey may be in earnest , or she may be pursuing a whim , or she may be opposing me ; but I object to it in any case , and in every case . If Mrs Dombey is in earnest , so much the less reluctant should she be to desist ; for she will not serve my daughter by any such display . If my wife has any superfluous gentleness , and duty over and above her proper submission to me , she may bestow them where she pleases , perhaps ; but I will have submission first!—Carker , ”
301817	301843	301809	301809	he	533	“ you will have the goodness not to omit or slur this point , but to consider it a very important part of your instructions . ”
301949	301955	301957	301957	Carker	533	“ I beg your pardon , ”
301977	302000	301965	301965	his	533	“ but let me understand . Mrs Dombey is aware of the probability of your making me the organ of your displeasure ? ”
302001	302004	302006	302007	Mr Dombey	533	“ Yes , ”
302009	302015	302006	302007	Mr Dombey	533	“ I have said so . ”
302016	302019	302021	302021	Carker	533	“ Yes , ”
302025	302029	302021	302021	Carker	533	“ but why ? ”
302030	302033	302034	302035	Mr Dombey	533	“ Why ! ”
302042	302048	302034	302035	Mr Dombey	533	“ Because I told her . ”
302049	302052	302054	302054	Carker	533	“ Ay , ”
302056	302067	302068	302068	he	533	“ But why did you tell her ? You see , ”
302097	302173	302068	302068	he	533	“ if I perfectly understand what is in your mind , I am so much more likely to be useful , and to have the happiness of being effectually employed . I think I do understand . I have not the honour of Mrs Dombey ’s good opinion . In my position , I have no reason to expect it ; but I take the fact to be , that I have not got it ? ”
302174	302178	302180	302181	Mr Dombey	533	“ Possibly not , ”
302183	302186	302180	302181	Mr Dombey	533	“ Consequently , ”
302190	302211	302180	302181	Mr Dombey	533	“ your making the communications to Mrs Dombey through me , is sure to be particularly unpalatable to that lady ? ”
302212	302218	302220	302221	Mr Dombey	533	“ It appears to me , ”
302233	302264	302220	302221	Mr Dombey	533	“ that Mrs Dombey ’s views upon the subject form no part of it as it presents itself to you and me , Carker . But it may be so . ”
302265	302276	302278	302278	Carker	533	“ And — pardon me — do I misconceive you , ”
302280	302351	302278	302278	Carker	533	“ when I think you descry in this , a likely means of humbling Mrs Dombey ’s pride — I use the word as expressive of a quality which , kept within due bounds , adorns and graces a lady so distinguished for her beauty and accomplishments — and , not to say of punishing her , but of reducing her to the submission you so naturally and justly require ? ”
302352	302364	302366	302367	Mr Dombey	533	“ I am not accustomed , Carker , as you know , ”
302369	302447	302366	302367	Mr Dombey	533	“ to give such close reasons for any course of conduct I think proper to adopt , but I will gainsay nothing of this . If you have any objection to found upon it , that is indeed another thing , and the mere statement that you have one will be sufficient . But I have not supposed , I confess , that any confidence I could entrust to you , would be likely to degrade you — ”
302448	302456	302458	302458	Carker	533	“ Oh ! _ I _ degraded ! ”
302460	302467	302458	302458	Carker	533	“ In _ your _ service ! ”
302468	302475	302477	302478	Mr Dombey	533	“ — or to place you , ”
302480	302486	302477	302478	Mr Dombey	533	“ in a false position . ”
302487	302496	302498	302498	Carker	533	“ _ I _ in a false position ! ”
302500	302657	302498	302498	Carker	533	“ I shall be proud — delighted — to execute your trust . I could have wished , I own , to have given the lady at whose feet I would lay my humble duty and devotion — for is she not your wife!—no new cause of dislike ; but a wish from you is , of course , paramount to every other consideration on earth . Besides , when Mrs Dombey is converted from these little errors of judgment , incidental , I would presume to say , to the novelty of her situation , I shall hope that she will perceive in the slight part I take , only a grain — my removed and different sphere gives room for little more — of the respect for you , and sacrifice of all considerations to you , of which it will be her pleasure and privilege to garner up a great store every day . ”
302697	302711	302713	302713	he	533	“ Nothing can make us stranger to each other than we are henceforth ! ”
302730	302736	302713	302713	he	533	“ Certainly , no doubt . ”
302737	302743	302713	302713	he	533	“ There is nothing more , ”
302775	302778	302780	302781	Mr Dombey	533	“ Nothing , ”
302783	302859	302780	302781	Mr Dombey	533	“ but this . You will be good enough to observe , Carker , that no message to Mrs Dombey with which you are or may be charged , admits of reply . You will be good enough to bring me no reply . Mrs Dombey is informed that it does not become me to temporise or treat upon any matter that is at issue between us , and that what I say is final . ”
303160	303178	303142	303142	he	533	“ I have given good cause of offence to Mrs Dombey now , if she knew it ! ”
304052	304055	304022	304022	He	533	“ Mama , ”
304061	304069	304022	304022	He	533	“ if I might venture to go ! ”
304172	304179	304180	304180	he	533	“ I am directed to request , ”
304183	304199	304180	304180	he	533	“ that the new housekeeper — Mrs Pipchin , I think , is the name — ”
304224	304317	304318	304318	He	533	“ — may be informed that Mr Dombey wishes to have his bed prepared in his own apartments downstairs , as he prefers those rooms to any other . I shall return to Mr Dombey almost immediately . That every possible attention has been paid to his comfort , and that he is the object of every possible solicitude , I need not assure you , Madam . Let me again say , there is no cause for the least alarm . Even you may be quite at ease , believe me . ”
305605	305615	305617	305618	Susan Nipper	241	“ And nice company he is , Miss Floy , ”
305620	305655	305617	305618	Susan Nipper	241	“ Oh , he ’s a precious piece of goods ! If ever he wants a character do n’t let him come to me whatever he does , that ’s all I tell him . ”
305656	305660	305662	305662	Florence	197	“ Dear Susan , ”
305664	305668	305662	305662	Florence	197	“ do n’t ! ”
305669	305685	305687	305688	the Nipper	241	“ Oh , it ’s very well to say ‘ do n’t ’ Miss Floy , ”
305693	305818	305687	305688	the Nipper	241	“ but raly begging your pardon we ’re coming to such passes that it turns all the blood in a person ’s body into pins and needles , with their pints all ways . Do n’t mistake me , Miss Floy , I do n’t mean nothing again your ma - in - law who has always treated me as a lady should though she is rather high I must say not that I have any right to object to that particular , but when we come to Mrs Pipchinses and having them put over us and keeping guard at your Pa ’s door like crocodiles ( only make us thankful that they lay no eggs ! ) we are a growing too outrageous ! ”
305819	305829	305831	305831	Florence	197	“ Papa thinks well of Mrs Pipchin , Susan , ”
305833	305850	305831	305831	Florence	197	“ and has a right to choose his housekeeper , you know . Pray do n’t ! ”
305851	305856	305858	305859	the Nipper	241	“ Well Miss Floy , ”
305861	305888	305858	305859	the Nipper	241	“ when you say do n’t , I never do I hope but Mrs Pipchin acts like early gooseberries upon me Miss , and nothing less . ”
306247	306250	306252	306252	Florence	197	“ Susan , ”
306262	306275	306252	306252	Florence	197	“ it is very late . I shall want nothing more tonight . ”
306276	306282	306284	306285	the Nipper	241	“ Ah , Miss Floy ! ”
306287	306361	306284	306285	the Nipper	241	“ I ’m sure I often wish for them old times when I sat up with you hours later than this and fell asleep through being tired out when you was as broad awake as spectacles , but you ’ve ma’s - in - law to come and sit with you now Miss Floy and I ’m thankful for it I ’m sure . I ’ve not a word to say against ’em . ”
306362	306379	306381	306381	Florence	197	“ I shall not forget who was my old companion when I had none , Susan , ”
306385	306388	306381	306381	Florence	197	“ never ! ”
306434	306441	306443	306443	Susan	241	“ Now my dear Miss Floy , ”
306445	306481	306443	306443	Susan	241	“ let me go downstairs again and see how your Pa is , I know you ’re wretched about him , do let me go downstairs again and knock at his door my own self . ”
306482	306485	306487	306487	Florence	197	“ No , ”
306489	306518	306487	306487	Florence	197	“ go to bed . We shall hear more in the morning . I will inquire myself in the morning . Mama has been down , I daresay ; ”
306529	306541	306523	306523	she	197	“ or is there now , perhaps . Good - night ! ”
308137	308140	308141	308141	she	197	“ Mama ! ”
308144	308150	308151	308151	Edith	481	“ what is the matter ? ”
308174	308177	308179	308179	Florence	197	“ Mama ! ”
308184	308193	308179	308179	Florence	197	“ Dear Mama ! what is the matter ? ”
308194	308201	308203	308203	Edith	481	“ I have not been well , ”
308218	308228	308203	308203	Edith	481	“ I have had bad dreams , my love . ”
308229	308239	308272	308272	she	197	“ And not yet been to bed , Mama ? ”
308240	308243	308244	308244	she	481	“ No , ”
308247	308253	308254	308254	Her	197	“ Half - waking dreams . ”
308279	308295	308272	308272	she	197	“ But what does my bird do here ? What does my bird do here ? ”
308296	308321	308322	308322	Florence	197	“ I have been uneasy , Mama , in not seeing you tonight , and in not knowing how Papa was ; and I — ”
308331	308336	308338	308338	Edith	481	“ Is it late ? ”
308359	308366	308338	308338	Edith	481	“ Very late . Near day . ”
308367	308371	308372	308372	she	481	“ Near day ! ”
308377	308389	308391	308391	Florence	197	“ Dear Mama , what have you done to your hand ? ”
308432	308440	308428	308428	she	197	“ Nothing , nothing . A blow . ”
308446	308450	308443	308443	she	197	“ My Florence ! ”
308463	308466	308468	308468	Florence	197	“ Mama ! ”
308470	308493	308468	308468	Florence	197	“ Oh Mama , what can I do , what should I do , to make us happier ? Is there anything ? ”
308494	308497	308498	308498	she	197	“ Nothing , ”
308501	308532	308534	308534	Florence	197	“ Are you sure of that ? Can it never be ? If I speak now of what is in my thoughts , in spite of what we have agreed , ”
308536	308546	308534	308534	Florence	197	“ you will not blame me , will you ? ”
308547	308552	308553	308553	she	197	“ It is useless , ”
308556	308584	308553	308553	she	197	“ useless . I have told you , dear , that I have had bad dreams . Nothing can change them , or prevent them coming back . ”
308585	308591	308593	308593	Florence	197	“ I do not understand , ”
308608	308613	308615	308615	Edith	481	“ I have dreamed , ”
308621	308740	308615	308615	Edith	481	“ of a pride that is all powerless for good , all powerful for evil ; of a pride that has been galled and goaded , through many shameful years , and has never recoiled except upon itself ; a pride that has debased its owner with the consciousness of deep humiliation , and never helped its owner boldly to resent it or avoid it , or to say , ‘ This shall not be ! ’ a pride that , rightly guided , might have led perhaps to better things , but which , misdirected and perverted , like all else belonging to the same possessor , has been self - contempt , mere hardihood and ruin . ”
308759	308764	308765	308765	she	481	“ I have dreamed , ”
308768	308849	308765	308765	she	481	“ of such indifference and callousness , arising from this self - contempt ; this wretched , inefficient , miserable pride ; that it has gone on with listless steps even to the altar , yielding to the old , familiar , beckoning finger,—oh mother , oh mother!—while it spurned it ; and willing to be hateful to itself for once and for all , rather than to be stung daily in some new form . Mean , poor thing ! ”
308868	308874	308875	308875	she	481	“ And I have dreamed , ”
308878	308957	308875	308875	she	481	“ that in a first late effort to achieve a purpose , it has been trodden on , and trodden down by a base foot , but turns and looks upon him . I have dreamed that it is wounded , hunted , set upon by dogs , but that it stands at bay , and will not yield ; no , that it can not if it would ; but that it is urged on to hate . ”
308986	308990	308991	308991	she	481	“ Oh Florence ! ”
308994	309004	308991	308991	she	481	“ I think I have been nearly mad tonight ! ”
309017	309035	308991	308991	she	481	“ Do n’t leave me ! be near me ! I have no hope but in you ! ”
309108	309123	309076	309076	Edith	481	“ For you are weary , dearest , and unhappy , and should rest . ”
309124	309135	309137	309137	Florence	197	“ I am indeed unhappy , dear Mama , tonight , ”
309139	309149	309076	309076	Edith	481	“ But you are weary and unhappy , too . ”
309150	309162	309163	309163	They	7018	“ Not when you lie asleep so near me , sweet . ”
309342	309357	309335	309335	she	197	“ Be near me , Florence . I have no hope but in you ! ”
309546	309554	309555	309555	she	4308	“ I have often said I would , ”
309576	309582	309555	309555	she	4308	“ and now I will ! ”
309729	309733	309735	309736	Mr Dombey	533	“ Come in ! ”
309782	309788	309790	309791	Mr Dombey	533	“ What do you want ? ”
309793	309807	309809	309809	Susan	241	“ If you please , Sir , I wish to speak to you , ”
309847	309857	309863	309863	her	241	“ I have been in your service , Sir , ”
309867	309870	309859	309860	Susan Nipper	241	“ now twelve “
309919	309942	309914	309917	a child in arms	7035	” Mr Dombey , raised upon his arm and looking at her , offered no comment on this preparatory statement of fact . “
309961	309965	309959	309959	Sir	735	” said Susan , “
310036	310053	310026	310026	I	0	” and here the black - eyed shook her head , and slightly stamped her foot ; “
310098	310139	310084	310084	I	0	” Mr Dombey turned yet paler than his fall had made him , with indignation and astonishment ; and kept his eyes upon the speaker as if he accused them , and his ears too , of playing him false . “
310155	310159	310153	310153	Sir	735	” pursued Susan , “
310186	310209	310179	310179	I	0	do!”—and here the black - eyed shook her head again , and slightly stamped her foot again , and checked a sob ; “
310235	310236	310239	310239	you	0	” “
310244	310253	310239	310239	you	0	” said Mr Dombey , glaring at her . “
310259	310260	310256	310256	you	0	” “
310289	310293	310286	310286	I	0	” said Susan . “
310322	310393	310304	310304	you	735	” Mr Dombey , in a fury , put his hand out for the bell - rope ; but there was no bell - rope on that side of the fire , and he could not rise and cross to the other without assistance . The quick eye of the Nipper detected his helplessness immediately , and now , as she afterwards observed , she felt she had got him . “
310397	310402	310394	310395	Miss Floy	197	” said Susan Nipper , “
310494	310503	310491	310491	he	7052	” cried Susan Nipper , bursting into tears , “
310522	310523	310524	310524	Woman	10967	” “
310526	310531	310524	310524	Woman	10967	” cried Mr Dombey , “
310536	310537	310524	310524	Woman	10967	” “
310554	310560	310552	310552	Sir	735	” replied the steadfast Nipper , “
310652	310673	310642	310642	I	0	” Which was rendered no less clear by the expression of Susan Nipper ’s countenance , than by her words . “
310685	310692	310677	310681	a person in your service	7059	” pursued the black - eyed , “
310754	310790	310752	310752	me	0	” Mr Dombey , in a paroxysm of rage , made another grasp at the bell - rope that was not there , and , in its absence , pulled his hair rather than nothing . “
310795	310800	310791	310791	I	0	” said Susan Nipper , “
310956	310957	310950	310950	I	0	” “
310963	310971	310960	310961	anybody there	5979	” cried Mr Dombey , calling out . “
310988	310989	310990	310990	I	0	” “
311003	311010	310990	310990	I	0	” said Susan , nothing checked , “
311136	311157	311128	311128	I	0	” said Susan Nipper , wiping her black eyes , and fixing them undauntingly on Mr Dombey ’s infuriated face . “
311204	311214	311197	311197	I	0	” cried Susan Nipper , in a final burst , “
311222	311223	311197	311197	I	0	” “
311229	311252	311197	311197	I	0	” cried the voice of Mrs Pipchin , as the black bombazeen garments of that fair Peruvian Miner swept into the room . “
311259	311287	311197	311197	I	0	” Susan favoured Mrs Pipchin with a look she had invented expressly for her when they first became acquainted , and resigned the reply to Mr Dombey . “
311292	311300	311197	311197	I	0	” repeated Mr Dombey , almost foaming . “
311336	311337	311331	311331	you	3633	” “
311348	311353	311346	311346	Sir	735	” croaked Mrs Pipchin . “
311368	311384	311386	311386	you	0	” But the inflexible Nipper , merely honouring Mrs Pipchin with another look , remained . “
311395	311400	311386	311386	you	0	” said Mr Dombey , “
311438	311439	311386	311386	you	0	” “
311444	311457	311386	311386	you	0	” returned Mrs Pipchin , with vengeance in her hard grey eye , “
311517	311532	311511	311511	You	735	” said Mrs Pipchin , sharply , and shaking her head at Susan Nipper . “
311544	311545	311542	311542	you	735	” “
311563	311574	311542	311542	you	735	” said Mr Dombey , turning back towards the fire , “
311598	311599	311600	311600	Sir	735	” “
311608	311613	311602	311602	I	0	” retorted Mrs Pipchin , “
311624	311631	311621	311622	Susan Nipper	241	” snapping her up particularly short , “
311640	311641	311621	311622	Susan Nipper	241	” “
311645	311651	311621	311622	Susan Nipper	241	” cried Susan , loftily . “
311654	311659	311621	311622	Susan Nipper	241	” returned Mrs Pipchin , “
311685	311686	311681	311681	you	735	” “
311700	311706	311694	311694	you	735	” said the voluble Nipper . “
311746	311747	311744	311745	Mrs P.	582	” “
311755	311762	311744	311745	Mrs P.	582	” said that wrathful old lady . “
311776	311777	311778	311778	My	0	” “
311782	311792	311778	311778	My	0	” said Susan , looking back at Mr Dombey , “
311838	311847	311828	311828	I	0	” ( here Mrs Pipchin uttered a very sharp “
311853	311861	311865	311865	I	0	” and Miss Nipper repeated the look ) “
311904	311976	311870	311870	they	7110	” With these words , Miss Nipper preceded her foe out of the room ; and walking upstairs to her own apartments in great state , to the choking exasperation of the ireful Pipchin , sat down among her boxes and began to cry . From this soft mood she was soon aroused , with a very wholesome and refreshing effect , by the voice of Mrs Pipchin outside the door . “
311984	311990	311978	311982	that bold - faced slut	7111	” said the fell Pipchin , “
312002	312040	312041	312041	You	7111	” Miss Nipper replied from within that the person described did not inhabit that part of the house , but that her name was Pipchin , and she was to be found in the housekeeper ’s room . “
312045	312058	312041	312041	You	7111	” retorted Mrs Pipchin , rattling at the handle of the door . “
312090	312143	312074	312074	you	7111	” To which Miss Nipper rejoined from her castle , that she pitied the better days that had seen Mrs Pipchin ; and that for her part she considered the worst days in the year to be about that lady ’s mark , except that they were much too good for her . “
312158	312163	312149	312149	yourself	7111	” said Susan Nipper , “
312187	312369	312370	312370	Susan	241	” The Dowager expressed her lively satisfaction at this intelligence , and with some general opinions upon young hussies as a race , and especially upon their demerits after being spoiled by Miss Dombey , withdrew to prepare the Nipper ’s wages . Susan then bestirred herself to get her trunks in order , that she might take an immediate and dignified departure ; sobbing heartily all the time , as she thought of Florence . [ Illustration ] The object of her regret was not long in coming to her , for the news soon spread over the house that Susan Nipper had had a disturbance with Mrs Pipchin , and that they had both appealed to Mr Dombey , and that there had been an unprecedented piece of work in Mr Dombey ’s room , and that Susan was going . The latter part of this confused rumour , Florence found to be so correct , that Susan had locked the last trunk and was sitting upon it with her bonnet on , when she came into her room . “
312372	312376	312370	312370	Susan	241	” cried Florence . “
312384	312385	312382	312382	You	241	” “
312395	312401	312392	312393	Miss Floy	197	” said Susan , sobbing , “
312436	312437	312438	312438	Susan	241	” “
312440	312444	312438	312438	Susan	241	” said Florence . “
312468	312469	312461	312461	you	241	” “
312489	312493	312484	312484	I	0	” sobbed Susan . “
312576	312577	312572	312574	my own dear	7119	” “
312586	312590	312593	312593	you	0	” said Florence , “
312597	312605	312593	312593	you	0	” For Susan was shaking her head . “
312615	312619	312593	312593	you	0	” returned Susan . “
312686	312703	312704	312705	My darling	9930	” With which entreaty , very heartily delivered , Susan hugged her mistress in her arms . “
312731	312735	312759	312759	my	0	” said Susan , “
312772	312773	312768	312770	sweet Miss Floy	197	” “
312781	312787	312779	312779	Susan	241	” asked her weeping mistress . “
312804	312812	312799	312802	a farmer in Essex	7126	” said the heart - broken Nipper , “
312886	313033	312880	312884	my heart ’s own mistress	7129	” Susan finished with a burst of sorrow , which was opportunely broken by the voice of Mrs Pipchin talking downstairs ; on hearing which , she dried her red and swollen eyes , and made a melancholy feint of calling jauntily to Mr Towlinson to fetch a cab and carry down her boxes . Florence , pale and hurried and distressed , but withheld from useless interference even here , by her dread of causing any new division between her father and his wife ( whose stern , indignant face had been a warning to her a few moments since ) , and by her apprehension of being in some way unconsciously connected already with the dismissal of her old servant and friend , followed , weeping , downstairs to Edith ’s dressing - room , whither Susan betook herself to make her parting curtsey . “
313054	313066	313067	313067	I	0	” said Mrs Pipchin , presenting herself at the same moment . “
313082	313112	313075	313076	Mr Dombey	533	” Edith , sitting under the hands of her maid — she was going out to dinner — preserved her haughty face , and took not the least notice . “
313118	313163	313075	313076	Mr Dombey	533	” said Mrs Pipchin , who , in pursuance of her system , and in recollection of the Mines , was accustomed to rout the servants about , as she had routed her young Brighton boarders ; to the everlasting acidulation of Master Bitherstone , “
313175	313284	313285	313285	I	0	” Susan had no spirits even for the look that belonged to Ma Pipchin by right ; so she dropped her curtsey to Mrs Dombey ( who inclined her head without one word , and whose eye avoided everyone but Florence ) , and gave one last parting hug to her young mistress , and received her parting embrace in return . Poor Susan ’s face at this crisis , in the intensity of her feelings and the determined suffocation of her sobs , lest one should become audible and be a triumph to Mrs Pipchin , presented a series of the most extraordinary physiognomical phenomena ever witnessed . “
313296	313310	313290	313290	Miss	10202	” said Towlinson , outside the door with the boxes , addressing Florence , “
313336	313373	313312	313313	Mr Toots	504	” Quick as thought , Florence glided out and hastened downstairs , where Mr Toots , in the most splendid vestments , was breathing very hard with doubt and agitation on the subject of her coming . “
313383	313388	313380	313381	Miss Dombey	287	” said Mr Toots , “
313394	313435	313380	313381	Miss Dombey	287	” This last ejaculation was occasioned by Mr Toots ’s deep concern at the distress he saw in Florence ’s face ; which caused him to stop short in a fit of chuckles , and become an image of despair . “
313440	313444	313436	313438	Dear Mr Toots	504	” said Florence , “
313468	313469	313470	313471	Miss Dombey	287	” “
313473	313478	313470	313471	Miss Dombey	287	” returned Mr Toots , “
313497	313506	313507	313507	I	0	” said Mr Toots , with some sentiment , “
313514	313515	313516	313516	Susan	583	” “
313532	313536	313516	313516	Susan	583	” said Florence , “
313579	313580	313581	313582	Miss Dombey	287	” “
313584	313589	313590	313590	you	287	” returned Mr Toots , “
313621	313622	313611	313611	I	0	” “
313625	313629	313611	313611	I	0	” said Florence , hurriedly—“no
313701	313935	313698	313698	you	0	” and Florence in her earnestness thanked him again and again ; and Mr Toots , in his earnestness , hurried away — but backwards , that he might lose no glimpse of her . Florence had not the courage to go out , when she saw poor Susan in the hall , with Mrs Pipchin driving her forth , and Diogenes jumping about her , and terrifying Mrs Pipchin to the last degree by making snaps at her bombazeen skirts , and howling with anguish at the sound of her voice — for the good duenna was the dearest and most cherished aversion of his breast . But she saw Susan shake hands with the servants all round , and turn once to look at her old home ; and she saw Diogenes bound out after the cab , and want to follow it , and testify an impossibility of conviction that he had no longer any property in the fare ; and the door was shut , and the hurry over , and her tears flowed fast for the loss of an old friend , whom no one could replace . No one . No one . Mr Toots , like the leal and trusty soul he was , stopped the cabriolet in a twinkling , and told Susan Nipper of his commission , at which she cried more than before . “
313942	313953	313954	313954	I	0	” said Mr Toots , taking his seat beside her . “
313993	314011	314012	314012	I	0	” Susan abandoned herself to her grief now , and it really was touching to see her . “
314015	314020	314012	314012	I	0	” said Mr Toots , “
314036	314037	314028	314028	I	0	” “
314044	314048	314041	314042	Mr Toots	504	” cried Susan . “
314065	314070	314071	314071	My	0	” said Mr Toots . “
314102	314112	314090	314090	she	7148	” said Mr Toots , as an additional recommendation , “
314129	314569	314570	314570	I	0	” Susan accepting this kind offer , Mr Toots conducted her to his dwelling , where they were received by the Matron in question who fully justified his character of her , and by the Chicken who at first supposed , on seeing a lady in the vehicle , that Mr Dombey had been doubled up , agreeably to his old recommendation , and Miss Dombey abducted . This gentleman awakened in Miss Nipper some considerable astonishment ; for , having been defeated by the Larkey Boy , his visage was in a state of such great dilapidation , as to be hardly presentable in society with comfort to the beholders . The Chicken himself attributed this punishment to his having had the misfortune to get into Chancery early in the proceedings , when he was severely fibbed by the Larkey one , and heavily grassed . But it appeared from the published records of that great contest that the Larkey Boy had had it all his own way from the beginning , and that the Chicken had been tapped , and bunged , and had received pepper , and had been made groggy , and had come up piping , and had endured a complication of similar strange inconveniences , until he had been gone into and finished . After a good repast , and much hospitality , Susan set out for the coach - office in another cabriolet , with Mr Toots inside , as before , and the Chicken on the box , who , whatever distinction he conferred on the little party by the moral weight and heroism of his character , was scarcely ornamental to it , physically speaking , on account of his plasters ; which were numerous . But the Chicken had registered a vow , in secret , that he would never leave Mr Toots ( who was secretly pining to get rid of him ) , for any less consideration than the good - will and fixtures of a public - house ; and being ambitious to go into that line , and drink himself to death as soon as possible , he felt it his cue to make his company unacceptable . The night - coach by which Susan was to go , was on the point of departure . Mr Toots having put her inside , lingered by the window , irresolutely , until the driver was about to mount ; when , standing on the step , and putting in a face that by the light of the lamp was anxious and confused , he said abruptly : “
314581	314582	314575	314576	Miss Dombey	287	” “
314587	314588	314575	314576	Miss Dombey	287	” “
314600	314601	314590	314590	you	735	” “
314610	314614	314602	314602	I	0	” said Susan , “
314622	314623	314620	314620	you	735	” “
314660	314666	314625	314625	you	735	” said poor Mr Toots . “
314671	314679	314625	314625	you	735	” returned Susan , shaking her head . “
314688	314689	314690	314690	Thank’ee	406	” “
314692	314697	314690	314690	Thank’ee	406	” said Mr Toots . “
314716	314919	314690	314690	Thank’ee	406	” CHAPTER XLV . The Trusty Agent Edith went out alone that day , and returned home early . It was but a few minutes after ten o’clock , when her carriage rolled along the street in which she lived . There was the same enforced composure on her face , that there had been when she was dressing ; and the wreath upon her head encircled the same cold and steady brow . But it would have been better to have seen its leaves and flowers reft into fragments by her passionate hand , or rendered shapeless by the fitful searches of a throbbing and bewildered brain for any resting - place , than adorning such tranquillity . So obdurate , so unapproachable , so unrelenting , one would have thought that nothing could soften such a woman ’s nature , and that everything in life had hardened it . Arrived at her own door , she was alighting , when some one coming quietly from the hall , and standing bareheaded , offered her his arm . The servant being thrust aside , she had no choice but to touch it ; and she then knew whose arm it was . “
314927	314936	314925	314925	Sir	735	” she asked , with a curled lip . “
314941	314945	314937	314937	He	7157	” returned Carker . “
314960	314984	314952	314952	I	0	” She bent her head , and was passing up the staircase , when he followed and said , speaking at the bottom : “
314998	315006	314988	314988	I	0	” She stopped and turned her eyes back “
315025	315026	315033	315033	Carker	533	” “
315035	315053	315054	315054	She	3633	“ As I am so fortunate as to have met you , let me press my petition . ”
315090	315096	315097	315097	she	3633	“ Where is Miss Dombey ? ”
315104	315112	315097	315097	she	3633	“ In the morning room , Ma’am . ”
315113	315119	315121	315121	her	3633	“ Show the way there ! ”
315158	315169	315171	315175	the soft and nimble Carker	7164	“ I beg your pardon ! Madam ! Mrs Dombey ! ”
315184	315198	315199	315199	She	3633	“ May I be permitted to entreat that Miss Dombey is not present ? ”
315218	315225	315227	315227	Carker	533	“ I would spare Miss Dombey , ”
315234	315296	315227	315227	Carker	533	“ the knowledge of what I have to say . At least , Madam , I would leave it to you to decide whether she shall know of it or not . I owe that to you . It is my bounden duty to you . After our former interview , it would be monstrous in me if I did otherwise . ”
315314	315319	315320	315320	He	735	“ Some other room . ”
315387	315395	315397	315397	Edith	481	“ Before I hear you , Sir , ”
315405	315413	315397	315397	Edith	481	“ I wish you to hear me . ”
315414	315422	315423	315423	he	533	“ To be addressed by Mrs Dombey , ”
315426	315464	315423	315423	he	533	“ even in accents of unmerited reproach , is an honour I so greatly esteem , that although I were not her servant in all things , I should defer to such a wish , most readily . ”
315465	315482	315483	315484	Mr Carker	533	“ If you are charged by the man whom you have just now left , Sir ; ”
315513	315555	315499	315499	she	481	“ with any message to me , do not attempt to deliver it , for I will not receive it . I need scarcely ask you if you are come on such an errand . I have expected you some time . ”
315556	315562	315563	315563	he	533	“ It is my misfortune , ”
315566	315597	315563	315563	he	533	“ to be here , wholly against my will , for such a purpose . Allow me to say that I am here for two purposes . That is one . ”
315598	315604	315605	315605	she	481	“ That one , Sir , ”
315608	315620	315605	315605	she	481	“ is ended . Or , if you return to it — ”
315621	315627	315629	315629	Carker	533	“ Can Mrs Dombey believe , ”
315634	315682	315629	315629	Carker	533	“ that I would return to it in the face of her prohibition ? Is it possible that Mrs Dombey , having no regard to my unfortunate position , is so determined to consider me inseparable from my instructor as to do me great and wilful injustice ? ”
315683	315686	315688	315688	Edith	481	“ Sir , ”
315737	315879	315880	315880	She	7168	“ Why do you present yourself to me , as you have done , and speak to me of love and duty to my husband , and pretend to think that I am happily married , and that I honour him ? How dare you venture so to affront me , when you know—_I _ do not know better , Sir : I have seen it in your every glance , and heard it in your every word — that in place of affection between us there is aversion and contempt , and that I despise him hardly less than I despise myself for being his ! Injustice ! If I had done justice to the torment you have made me feel , and to my sense of the insult you have put upon me , I should have slain you ! ”
316074	316077	316078	316078	he	7169	“ Madam , ”
316081	316129	316078	316078	he	7169	“ I know , and knew before today , that I have found no favour with you ; and I knew why . Yes . I knew why . You have spoken so openly to me ; I am so relieved by the possession of your confidence — ”
316130	316133	316134	316134	she	7168	“ Confidence ! ”
316145	316237	316140	316140	He	7169	“ — that I will make no pretence of concealment . I did see from the first , that there was no affection on your part for Mr Dombey — how could it possibly exist between such different subjects ? And I have seen , since , that stronger feelings than indifference have been engendered in your breast — how could that possibly be otherwise , either , circumstanced as you have been ? But was it for me to presume to avow this knowledge to you in so many words ? ”
316238	316246	316247	316247	she	7168	“ Was it for you , Sir , ”
316250	316268	316247	316247	she	7168	“ to feign that other belief , and audaciously to thrust it on me day by day ? ”
316269	316275	316276	316276	he	7169	“ Madam , it was , ”
316280	316349	316276	316276	he	7169	“ If I had done less , if I had done anything but that , I should not be speaking to you thus ; and I foresaw — who could better foresee , for who has had greater experience of Mr Dombey than myself?—that unless your character should prove to be as yielding and obedient as that of his first submissive lady , which I did not believe — ”
316364	316394	316247	316247	she	7168	“ I say , which I did not believe,—the time was likely to come , when such an understanding as we have now arrived at , would be serviceable . ”
316395	316402	316403	316403	she	7168	“ Serviceable to whom , Sir ? ”
316407	316459	316403	316403	she	7168	“ To you . I will not add to myself , as warning me to refrain even from that limited commendation of Mr Dombey , in which I can honestly indulge , in order that I may not have the misfortune of saying anything distasteful to one whose aversion and contempt , ”
316464	316469	316403	316403	she	7168	“ are so keen . ”
316470	316479	316481	316481	Edith	481	“ Is it honest in you , Sir , ”
316483	316513	316481	316481	Edith	481	“ to confess to your ‘ limited commendation , ’ and to speak in that tone of disparagement , even of him : being his chief counsellor and flatterer ! ”
316514	316517	316519	316519	Carker	533	“ Counsellor,—yes , ”
316521	316582	316519	316519	Carker	533	“ Flatterer,—no . A little reservation I fear I must confess to . But our interest and convenience commonly oblige many of us to make professions that we can not feel . We have partnerships of interest and convenience , friendships of interest and convenience , dealings of interest and convenience , marriages of interest and convenience , every day . ”
316605	316608	316610	316611	Mr Carker	533	“ Madam , ”
316635	316687	316610	316611	Mr Carker	533	“ why should I hesitate now , being altogether devoted to your service , to speak plainly ? It was natural that a lady , endowed as you are , should think it feasible to change her husband ’s character in some respects , and mould him to a better form . ”
316688	316698	316699	316699	she	481	“ It was not natural to me , Sir , ”
316702	316714	316699	316699	she	481	“ I had never any expectation or intention of that kind . ”
316756	316763	316764	316764	he	533	“ At least it was natural , ”
316767	316892	316764	316764	he	533	“ that you should deem it quite possible to live with Mr Dombey as his wife , at once without submitting to him , and without coming into such violent collision with him . But , Madam , you did not know Mr Dombey ( as you have since ascertained ) , when you thought that . You did not know how exacting and how proud he is , or how he is , if I may say so , the slave of his own greatness , and goes yoked to his own triumphal car like a beast of burden , with no idea on earth but that it is behind him and is to be drawn on , over everything and through everything . ”
316910	317136	316905	316905	he	7172	“ Mr Dombey is really capable of no more true consideration for you , Madam , than for me . The comparison is an extreme one ; I intend it to be so ; but quite just . Mr Dombey , in the plenitude of his power , asked me — I had it from his own lips yesterday morning — to be his go - between to you , because he knows I am not agreeable to you , and because he intends that I shall be a punishment for your contumacy ; and besides that , because he really does consider , that I , his paid servant , am an ambassador whom it is derogatory to the dignity — not of the lady to whom I have the happiness of speaking ; she has no existence in his mind — but of his wife , a part of himself , to receive . You may imagine how regardless of me , how obtuse to the possibility of my having any individual sentiment or opinion he is , when he tells me , openly , that I am so employed . You know how perfectly indifferent to your feelings he is , when he threatens you with such a messenger . As you , of course , have not forgotten that he did . ”
317186	317354	317150	317150	he	7174	“ I do not recall all this to widen the breach between yourself and Mr Dombey , Madam — Heaven forbid ! what would it profit me?—but as an example of the hopelessness of impressing Mr Dombey with a sense that anybody is to be considered when he is in question . We who are about him , have , in our various positions , done our part , I daresay , to confirm him in his way of thinking ; but if we had not done so , others would — or they would not have been about him ; and it has always been , from the beginning , the very staple of his life . Mr Dombey has had to deal , in short , with none but submissive and dependent persons , who have bowed the knee , and bent the neck , before him . He has never known what it is to have angry pride and strong resentment opposed to him . ”
317355	317363	317364	317364	she	7176	“ But he will know it now ! ”
317424	317434	317435	317435	he	7177	“ Mr Dombey , though a most honourable gentleman , ”
317438	317540	317435	317435	he	7177	“ is so prone to pervert even facts to his own view , when he is at all opposed , in consequence of the warp in his mind , that he — can I give a better instance than this!—he sincerely believes ( you will excuse the folly of what I am about to say ; it not being mine ) that his severe expression of opinion to his present wife , on a certain special occasion she may remember , before the lamented death of Mrs Skewton , produced a withering effect , and for the moment quite subdued her ! ”
317564	317567	317568	317568	he	7177	“ Madam , ”
317571	317594	317595	317595	he	7177	“ I have done with this . Your own opinions are so strong , and , I am persuaded , so unalterable , ”
317605	317683	317595	317595	he	7177	“ that I am almost afraid to incur your displeasure anew , when I say that in spite of these defects and my full knowledge of them , I have become habituated to Mr Dombey , and esteem him . But when I say so , it is not , believe me , for the mere sake of vaunting a feeling that is so utterly at variance with your own , and for which you can have no sympathy”—oh
317691	317726	317727	317727	She	7178	was!—“but to give you an assurance of the zeal with which , in this unhappy matter , I am yours , and the indignation with which I regard the part I am to fill ! ”
317753	317759	317761	317761	Carker	533	“ It is growing late , ”
317767	317825	317761	317761	Carker	533	“ and you are , as you said , fatigued . But the second object of this interview , I must not forget . I must recommend you , I must entreat you in the most earnest manner , for sufficient reasons that I have , to be cautious in your demonstrations of regard for Miss Dombey . ”
317826	317834	317761	317761	Carker	533	“ Cautious ! What do you mean ? ”
317835	317850	317761	317761	Carker	533	“ To be careful how you exhibit too much affection for that young lady . ”
317851	317858	317860	317860	Edith	481	“ Too much affection , Sir ! ”
317869	317882	317860	317860	Edith	481	“ Who judges my affection , or measures it out ? You ? ”
317883	317892	317761	317761	Carker	533	“ It is not I who do so . ”
317903	317907	317893	317893	He	533	“ Who then ? ”
317908	317916	317860	317860	Edith	481	“ Can you not guess who then ? ”
317917	317925	317926	317926	she	481	“ I do not choose to guess , ”
317929	317932	317933	317933	he	533	“ Madam , ”
317955	318038	317860	317860	Edith	481	“ I am in a difficulty here . You have told me you will receive no message , and you have forbidden me to return to that subject ; but the two subjects are so closely entwined , I find , that unless you will accept this vague caution from one who has now the honour to possess your confidence , though the way to it has been through your displeasure , I must violate the injunction you have laid upon me . ”
318039	318052	318054	318054	Edith	481	“ You know that you are free to do so , Sir , ”
318056	318060	318054	318054	Edith	481	“ Do it . ”
318078	318083	318084	318084	he	7181	“ His instructions were , ”
318092	318159	318084	318084	he	7181	“ that I should inform you that your demeanour towards Miss Dombey is not agreeable to him . That it suggests comparisons to him which are not favourable to himself . That he desires it may be wholly changed ; and that if you are in earnest , he is confident it will be ; for your continued show of affection will not benefit its object . ”
318160	318166	318167	318167	she	481	“ That is a threat , ”
318170	318176	318177	318177	he	7181	“ That is a threat , ”
318190	318197	318181	318181	his	7181	“ but not directed against you . ”
318300	318311	318295	318295	her	481	“ Please to leave me . Say no more tonight . ”
318312	318320	318322	318323	Mr Carker	533	“ I feel the urgency of this , ”
318325	318401	318322	318323	Mr Carker	533	“ because it is impossible to say what unforeseen consequences might arise , or how soon , from your being unacquainted with his state of mind . I understand Miss Dombey is concerned , now , at the dismissal of her old servant , which is likely to have been a minor consequence in itself . You do n’t blame me for requesting that Miss Dombey might not be present . May I hope so ? ”
318402	318414	318295	318295	her	481	“ I do not . Please to leave me , Sir . ”
318415	318467	318469	318469	Carker	533	“ I knew that your regard for the young lady , which is very sincere and strong , I am well persuaded , would render it a great unhappiness to you , ever to be a prey to the reflection that you had injured her position and ruined her future hopes , ”
318475	318487	318469	318469	Carker	533	“ No more tonight . Leave me , if you please . ”
318488	318530	318531	318531	She	7182	“ I shall be here constantly in my attendance upon him , and in the transaction of business matters . You will allow me to see you again , and to consult what should be done , and learn your wishes ? ”
318538	318595	318531	318531	She	7182	“ I can not even decide whether to tell him I have spoken to you yet ; or to lead him to suppose that I have deferred doing so , for want of opportunity , or for any other reason . It will be necessary that you should enable me to consult with you very soon . ”
318596	318603	318604	318604	she	7182	“ At any time but now , ”
318607	318672	318604	318604	she	7182	“ You will understand , when I wish to see you , that Miss Dombey is not to be present ; and that I seek an interview as one who has the happiness to possess your confidence , and who comes to render you every assistance in his power , and , perhaps , on many occasions , to ward off evil from her ? ”
318704	318707	318701	318701	she	7182	“ Yes ! ”
318737	318769	318770	318770	She	7182	“ I am forgiven , and have explained my fault . May I — for Miss Dombey ’s sake , and for my own — take your hand before I go ? ”
318883	318911	318878	318878	her	481	“ May this man be a liar ! For if he has spoken truth , she is lost to me , and I have no hope left ! ”
319771	319777	319779	319783	one of these two women	7219	“ See where he goes ! ”
319847	319857	319858	319858	she	7224	“ I never thought to look at him again , ”
319866	319882	319858	319858	she	7224	“ but it ’s well I should , perhaps . I see . I see ! ”
319883	319887	319889	319891	the old woman	10432	“ Not changed ! ”
319900	319904	319906	319907	the other	10537	“ He changed ! ”
319909	319932	319906	319907	the other	10537	“ What for ? What has he suffered ? There is change enough for twenty in me . Is n’t that enough ? ”
319933	319939	319941	319943	the old woman	10432	“ See where he goes ! ”
319953	319970	319941	319943	the old woman	10432	“ so easy and so trim a - horseback , while we are in the mud . ”
319971	319976	319978	319979	her daughter	2433	“ And of it , ”
319982	319998	320000	320000	Illustration	197	“ We are mud , underneath his horse ’s feet . What should we be ? ”
320075	320078	320080	320082	the old woman	10432	“ Deary ! ”
320085	320092	320080	320082	the old woman	10432	“ Alice ! Handsome gall Ally ! ”
320103	320130	320093	320093	She	10432	“ Will you let him go like that , when you can wring money from him ? Why , it ’s a wickedness , my daughter . ”
320131	320147	320148	320148	she	10432	“ Have n’t I told you , that I will not have money from him ? ”
320151	320214	320148	320148	she	10432	“ And do n’t you yet believe me ? Did I take his sister ’s money ? Would I touch a penny , if I knew it , that had gone through his white hands — unless it was , indeed , that I could poison it , and send it back to him ? Peace , mother , and come away . ”
320215	320221	320223	320225	the old woman	10432	“ And him so rich ? ”
320227	320233	320223	320225	the old woman	10432	“ And us so poor ! ”
320234	320251	320253	320254	her daughter	2433	“ Poor in not being able to pay him any of the harm we owe him , ”
320256	320294	320253	320254	her daughter	2433	“ Let him give me that sort of riches , and I ’ll take them from him , and use them . Come away . Its no good looking at his horse . Come away , mother ! ”
320389	320403	320404	320404	she	10432	“ Why , where ’s my sprightly Rob been , all this time ! ”
320441	320528	320530	320531	the Grinder	4568	“ Oh ! why ca n’t you leave a poor cove alone , Misses Brown , when he ’s getting an honest livelihood and conducting himself respectable ? What do you come and deprive a cove of his character for , by talking to him in the streets , when he ’s taking his master ’s horse to a honest stable — a horse you ’d go and sell for cats ’ and dogs ’ meat if you had your way ! Why , I thought , ”
320548	320556	320530	320531	the Grinder	4568	“ that you was dead long ago ! ”
320557	320563	320565	320567	the old woman	10432	“ This is the way , ”
320574	320613	320565	320567	the old woman	10432	“ that he talks to me , who knew him weeks and months together , my deary , and have stood his friend many and many a time among the pigeon - fancying tramps and bird - catchers . ”
320614	320626	320628	320628	Rob	424	“ Let the birds be , will you , Misses Brown ? ”
320638	320681	320628	320628	Rob	424	“ I think a cove had better have to do with lions than them little creeturs , for they ’re always flying back in your face when you least expect it . Well , how d’ye do and what do you want ? ”
320702	320715	320717	320718	Mrs Brown	285	“ Hark how he speaks to an old friend , my deary ! ”
320726	320763	320717	320718	Mrs Brown	285	“ But there ’s some of his old friends not so patient as me . If I was to tell some that he knows , and has spotted and cheated with , where to find him — ”
320764	320774	320776	320778	the miserable Grinder	7246	“ Will you hold your tongue , Misses Brown ? ”
320799	320831	320717	320718	Mrs Brown	285	“ What do you take a pleasure in ruining a cove for ? At your time of life too ! when you ought to be thinking of a variety of things ! ”
320832	320838	320840	320842	the old woman	10432	“ What a gallant horse ! ”
320850	320861	320863	320863	Rob	424	“ Let him alone , will you , Misses Brown ? ”
320870	320881	320863	320863	Rob	424	“ You ’re enough to drive a penitent cove mad ! ”
320882	320894	320896	320898	the old woman	10432	“ Why , what hurt do I do him , child ? ”
320900	320903	320905	320905	Rob	424	“ Hurt ? ”
320907	320926	320928	320928	he	424	“ He ’s got a master that would find it out if he was touched with a straw . ”
321000	321009	321011	321011	she	10432	“ A good place , Rob , eh ? ”
321013	321022	321011	321011	she	10432	“ You ’re in luck , my child . ”
321023	321034	321036	321038	the wretched Grinder	7253	“ Oh do n’t talk about luck , Misses Brown , ”
321045	321083	321085	321085	Rob	424	“ If you ’d never come , or if you ’d go away , then indeed a cove might be considered tolerable lucky . Ca n’t you go along , Misses Brown , and not foller me ! ”
321091	321119	321085	321085	Rob	424	“ If the young woman ’s a friend of yours , why do n’t she take you away , instead of letting you make yourself so disgraceful ! ”
321120	321123	321125	321127	the old woman	10432	“ What ! ”
321154	321279	321125	321127	the old woman	10432	“ Do you deny your old chum ! Have you lurked to my house fifty times , and slept sound in a corner when you had no other bed but the paving - stones , and do you talk to me like this ! Have I bought and sold with you , and helped you in my way of business , schoolboy , sneak , and what not , and do you tell me to go along ? Could I raise a crowd of old company about you to - morrow morning , that would follow you to ruin like copies of your own shadow , and do you turn on me with your bold looks ! I ’ll go . Come , Alice . ”
321280	321286	321288	321290	the distracted Grinder	7255	“ Stop , Misses Brown ! ”
321292	321351	321353	321353	Rob	424	“ What are you doing of ? Do n’t put yourself in a passion ! Do n’t let her go , if you please . I have n’t meant any offence . I said ‘ how d’ye do , ’ at first , did n’t I ? But you would n’t answer . How you do ? Besides , ”
321356	321396	321353	321353	Rob	424	“ look here ! How can a cove stand talking in the street with his master ’s prad a - wanting to be took to be rubbed down , and his master up to every individgle thing that happens ! ”
321419	321445	321447	321447	Rob	424	“ Come along to the stables , and have a glass of something that ’s good for you , Misses Brown , ca n’t you ? ”
321449	321480	321482	321482	Rob	424	“ instead of going on , like that , which is no good to you , nor anybody else . Come along with her , will you be so kind ? ”
321484	321503	321482	321482	Rob	424	“ I ’m sure I ’m delighted to see her , if it was n’t for the horse ! ”
321642	321652	321654	321656	the old woman	10432	“ Here ’s master — Mr Carker , child ! ”
321666	321671	321654	321656	the old woman	10432	“ Lord bless him ! ”
321672	321684	321686	321686	Rob	424	“ Why , I did n’t tell you who he was , ”
321692	321699	321701	321702	Mrs Brown	285	“ We know him by sight , ”
321722	321745	321701	321702	Mrs Brown	285	“ We saw him pass this morning , afore he got off his horse ; when you were ready to take it . ”
321746	321751	321753	321753	Rob	424	“ Ay , ay , ”
321767	321779	321701	321702	Mrs Brown	285	place.—“What ’s the matter with her ? Wo n’t she drink ? ”
321816	321822	321823	321823	she	10432	“ Do n’t mind her , ”
321826	321844	321823	321823	she	10432	“ she ’s a strange creetur , if you know’d her , Rob . But Mr Carker — ”
321845	321848	321850	321850	Rob	424	“ Hush ! ”
321887	321890	321880	321881	Mr Carker	533	“ Softly . ”
321891	321899	321901	321902	Mrs Brown	285	“ Why , he ai n’t here ! ”
321904	321911	321913	321913	Rob	424	“ I do n’t know that , ”
321938	321942	321944	321945	Mrs Brown	285	“ Good master ? ”
321958	321962	321947	321947	Rob	424	“ precious sharp . ”
321963	321975	321977	321979	the old woman	10432	“ Lives out of town , do n’t he , lovey ? ”
321981	321988	321977	321979	the old woman	10432	“ When he ’s at home , ”
321992	322003	321977	321979	the old woman	10432	“ but we do n’t live at home just now . ”
322004	322008	322010	322012	the old woman	10432	“ Where then ? ”
322014	322023	322025	322025	Rob	424	“ Lodgings ; up near Mr Dombey ’s , ”
322064	322082	322084	322084	Rob	424	“ Mr Dombey — you and I used to talk about him , sometimes , you know , ”
322089	322100	322101	322103	The old woman	10432	“ You used to get me to talk about him . ”
322106	322121	322123	322123	Rob	424	“ Well , Mr Dombey , he ’s had a fall from his horse , ”
322127	322162	322123	322123	Rob	424	“ and my master has to be up there , more than usual , either with him , or Mrs Dombey , or some of ’em ; and so we ’ve come to town . ”
322163	322171	322173	322175	the old woman	10432	“ Are they good friends , lovey ? ”
322177	322180	322182	322182	Rob	424	“ Who ? ”

322190	322198	322200	322200	Rob	424	“ What , Mr and Mrs Dombey ? ”
322202	322208	322200	322200	Rob	424	“ How should I know ! ”
322209	322220	322222	322224	the old woman	10432	“ Not them — Master and Mrs Dombey , chick , ”
322228	322234	322236	322236	Rob	424	“ I do n’t know , ”
322243	322262	322236	322236	Rob	424	“ I suppose so . How curious you are , Misses Brown ! Least said , soonest mended . ”
322263	322272	322274	322276	the old woman	10432	“ Why there ’s no harm in it ! ”
322289	322310	322286	322286	her	10432	“ Sprightly Rob , has grown tame since he has been well off ! There ’s no harm in it . ”
322311	322324	322326	322326	Rob	424	“ No , there ’s no harm in it , I know , ”
322348	322418	322326	322326	Rob	424	“ but blabbing , if it ’s only about the number of buttons on my master ’s coat , wo n’t do . I tell you it wo n’t do with him . A cove had better drown himself . He says so . I should n’t have so much as told you what his name was , if you had n’t known it . Talk about somebody else . ”
322473	322478	322480	322482	the old woman	10432	“ Rob , lovey ! ”
322494	322518	322480	322482	the old woman	10432	“ You were always a pet and favourite of mine . Now , were n’t you ? Do n’t you know you were ? ”
322519	322525	322527	322528	the Grinder	4568	“ Yes , Misses Brown , ”
322536	322543	322545	322547	the old woman	10432	“ And you could leave me ! ”
322556	322590	322550	322550	her	10432	“ You could go away , and grow almost out of knowledge , and never come to tell your poor old friend how fortunate you were , proud lad ! Oho , Oho ! ”
322591	322612	322614	322616	the wretched Grinder	7253	“ Oh here ’s a dreadful go for a cove that ’s got a master wide awake in the neighbourhood ! ”
322618	322627	322614	322616	the wretched Grinder	7253	“ To be howled over like this here ! ”
322628	322639	322641	322642	Mrs Brown	285	“ Wo n’t you come and see me , Robby ? ”
322644	322656	322641	322642	Mrs Brown	285	“ Oho , wo n’t you ever come and see me ? ”
322657	322669	322614	322616	the wretched Grinder	7253	“ Yes , I tell you ! Yes , I will ! ”
322674	322686	322688	322689	Mrs Brown	285	“ That ’s my own Rob ! That ’s my lovey ! ”
322706	322714	322688	322689	Mrs Brown	285	“ At the old place , Rob ? ”
322715	322718	322720	322721	the Grinder	4568	“ Yes , ”
322723	322729	322731	322732	Mrs Brown	285	“ Soon , Robby dear ? ”
322734	322738	322731	322732	Mrs Brown	285	“ and often ? ”
322739	322746	322748	322748	Rob	424	“ Yes . Yes . Yes , ”
322750	322761	322748	322748	Rob	424	“ I will indeed , upon my soul and body . ”
322762	322766	322768	322769	Mrs Brown	285	“ And then , ”
322787	322821	322768	322769	Mrs Brown	285	“ if he ’s true to his word , I ’ll never come a - near him though I know where he is , and never breathe a syllable about him ! Never ! ”
322901	322907	322908	322908	she	285	“ A shilling , dear ! ”
322917	322934	322908	322908	she	285	“ or sixpence ! For old acquaintance sake . I ’m so poor . And my handsome gal”—looking
322937	322948	322912	322912	her	285	shoulder—“she ’s my gal , Rob — half starves me . ”
322979	322982	322983	322983	she	285	“ What , ”
322986	323018	322983	322983	she	285	“ mother ! always money ! money from the first , and to the last . Do you mind so little what I said but now ? Here . Take it ! ”
323516	323528	323529	323530	His brother	683	“ Well , John Carker , and what brings you here ? ”
323541	323545	323547	323548	the Manager	11470	“ I wonder , ”
323550	323564	323547	323548	the Manager	11470	“ that you can come and go , without inquiring how our master is ”
323566	323584	323586	323587	his brother	683	“ We had word this morning in the Counting House , that Mr Dombey was doing well , ”
323589	323597	323599	323600	the Manager	11470	“ You are such a meek fellow , ”
323604	323634	323599	323600	the Manager	11470	smile,—“but you have grown so , in the course of years — that if any harm came to him , you ’d be miserable , I dare swear now . ”
323635	323644	323646	323647	the other	10537	“ I should be truly sorry , James , ”
323649	323655	323657	323658	the Manager	11470	“ He would be sorry ! ”
323678	323743	323657	323658	the Manager	11470	“ He would be truly sorry ! This brother of mine ! This junior of the place , this slighted piece of lumber , pushed aside with his face to the wall , like a rotten picture , and left so , for Heaven knows how many years he ’s all gratitude and respect , and devotion too , he would have me believe ! ”
323744	323754	323756	323757	the other	10537	“ I would have you believe nothing , James , ”
323759	323785	323756	323757	the other	10537	“ Be as just to me as you would to any other man below you . You ask a question , and I answer it . ”
323786	323794	323796	323797	the Manager	11470	“ And have you nothing , Spaniel , ”
323803	323840	323796	323797	the Manager	11470	“ to complain of in him ? No proud treatment to resent , no insolence , no foolery of state , no exaction of any sort ! What the devil ! are you man or mouse ? ”
323841	323883	323885	323886	John Carker	274	“ It would be strange if any two persons could be together for so many years , especially as superior and inferior , without each having something to complain of in the other — as he thought , at all events , ”
323888	323896	323885	323886	John Carker	274	“ But apart from my history here — ”
323897	323902	323904	323905	the Manager	11470	“ His history here ! ”
323907	323934	323904	323905	the Manager	11470	“ Why , there it is . The very fact that makes him an extreme case , puts him out of the whole chapter ! Well ? ”
323935	324015	323885	323886	John Carker	274	“ Apart from that , which , as you hint , gives me a reason to be thankful that I alone ( happily for all the rest ) possess , surely there is no one in the House who would not say and feel at least as much . You do not think that anybody here would be indifferent to a mischance or misfortune happening to the head of the House , or anything than truly sorry for it ? ”
324016	324028	324030	324031	the Manager	11470	“ You have good reason to be bound to him too ! ”
324035	324074	324030	324031	the Manager	11470	“ Why , do n’t you believe that you are kept here , as a cheap example , and a famous instance of the clemency of Dombey and Son , redounding to the credit of the illustrious House ? ”
324075	324078	324080	324081	his brother	683	“ No , ”
324085	324102	324080	324081	his brother	683	“ I have long believed that I am kept here for more kind and disinterested reasons . ”
324103	324109	324111	324112	the Manager	11470	“ But you were going , ”
324123	324133	324111	324112	the Manager	11470	“ to recite some Christian precept , I observed . ”
324134	324139	324141	324142	the other	10537	“ Nay , James , ”
324144	324160	324141	324142	the other	10537	“ though the tie of brotherhood between us has been long broken and thrown away — ”
324161	324169	324171	324172	the Manager	11470	“ Who broke it , good Sir ? ”
324174	324189	324190	324191	The Manager	11470	“ I , by my misconduct . I do not charge it upon you . ”
324203	324214	324199	324199	his	11470	“ Oh , you do n’t charge it upon me ! ”
324221	324395	324199	324199	his	11470	“ I say , though there is not that tie between us , do not , I entreat , assail me with unnecessary taunts , or misinterpret what I say , or would say . I was only going to suggest to you that it would be a mistake to suppose that it is only you , who have been selected here , above all others , for advancement , confidence and distinction ( selected , in the beginning , I know , for your great ability and trustfulness ) , and who communicate more freely with Mr Dombey than anyone , and stand , it may be said , on equal terms with him , and have been favoured and enriched by him — that it would be a mistake to suppose that it is only you who are tender of his welfare and reputation . There is no one in the House , from yourself down to the lowest , I sincerely believe , who does not participate in that feeling . ”
324396	324400	324402	324403	the Manager	11470	“ You lie ! ”
324410	324423	324402	324403	the Manager	11470	“ You ’re a hypocrite , John Carker , and you lie . ”
324424	324427	324429	324430	the other	10537	“ James ! ”
324437	324459	324429	324430	the other	10537	“ What do you mean by these insulting words ? Why do you so basely use them to me , unprovoked ? ”
324460	324465	324467	324468	the Manager	11470	“ I tell you , ”
324470	324494	324496	324496	his	11470	“ that your hypocrisy and meekness — that all the hypocrisy and meekness of this place — is not worth that to me , ”
324501	324625	324496	324496	his	11470	“ and that I see through it as if it were air ! There is not a man employed here , standing between myself and the lowest in place ( of whom you are very considerate , and with reason , for he is not far off ) , who would n’t be glad at heart to see his master humbled : who does not hate him , secretly : who does not wish him evil rather than good : and who would not turn upon him , if he had the power and boldness . The nearer to his favour , the nearer to his insolence ; the closer to him , the farther from him . That ’s the creed here ! ”
324626	324632	324634	324635	his brother	683	“ I do n’t know , ”
324646	324720	324634	324635	his brother	683	“ who may have abused your ear with such representations ; or why you have chosen to try me , rather than another . But that you have been trying me , and tampering with me , I am now sure . You have a different manner and a different aspect from any that I ever saw in you . I will only say to you , once more , you are deceived . ”
324721	324727	324729	324730	the Manager	11470	“ I know I am , ”
324732	324739	324729	324730	the Manager	11470	“ I have told you so . ”
324740	324745	324747	324748	his brother	683	“ Not by me , ”
324750	324770	324747	324748	his brother	683	“ By your informant , if you have one . If not , by your own thoughts and suspicions . ”
324771	324777	324779	324780	the Manager	11470	“ I have no suspicions , ”
324782	324820	324779	324780	the Manager	11470	“ Mine are certainties . You pusillanimous , abject , cringing dogs ! All making the same show , all canting the same story , all whining the same professions , all harbouring the same transparent secret . ”
324860	324869	324870	324870	he	11470	“ The faint - hearted , fawning knaves , ”
324883	324949	324870	324870	he	11470	“ There ’s not one among them , who would n’t feign to be so shocked and outraged — ! Bah ! There ’s not one among them , but if he had at once the power , and the wit and daring to use it , would scatter Dombey ’s pride and lay it low , as ruthlessly as I rake out these ashes . ”
324975	324983	324984	324984	he	11470	“ Without the same queen beckoner too ! ”
324988	325005	324984	324984	he	11470	“ and there is pride there , not to be forgotten — witness our own acquaintance ! ”
325144	325148	325149	325149	he	11470	“ Time was , ”
325152	325194	325149	325149	he	11470	“ when it was well to watch even your rising little star , and know in what quarter there were clouds , to shadow you if needful . But a planet has arisen , and you are lost in its light . ”
326381	326388	326376	326376	her	7373	“ I do n’t believe it ! ”
327670	327673	327675	327675	Florence	197	“ Mama , ”

327696	327703	327705	327705	Florence	197	“ I must have done something , ”
327707	327746	327705	327705	Florence	197	“ Tell me what it is . You have changed your manner to me , dear Mama . I can not say how instantly I feel the least change ; for I love you with my whole heart . ”
327747	327753	327755	327755	Edith	481	“ As I do you , ”
327757	327769	327755	327755	Edith	481	“ Ah , Florence , believe me never more than now ! ”
327770	327785	327787	327787	Florence	197	“ Why do you go away from me so often , and keep away ? ”
327789	327812	327813	327813	Edith	481	“ And why do you sometimes look so strangely on me , dear Mama ? You do so , do you not ? ”
327821	327824	327826	327826	Florence	197	“ Why ? ”
327829	327855	327826	327826	Florence	197	“ Tell me why , that I may know how to please you better ; and tell me this shall not be so any more . ”
327856	327860	327862	327862	Edith	481	“ My Florence , ”
327893	327940	327885	327885	Florence	197	“ why it is , I can not tell you . It is neither for me to say , nor you to hear ; but that it is , and that it must be , I know . Should I do it if I did not ? ”
327941	327950	327952	327952	Florence	197	“ Are we to be estranged , Mama ? ”
327966	327969	327961	327961	Edith	481	“ Yes . ”

328009	328040	328041	328041	She	481	“ listen to me . I can not bear to see this grief . Be calmer . You see that I am composed , and is it nothing to me ? ”
328059	328103	328049	328049	she	481	“ Not wholly estranged . Partially : and only that , in appearance , Florence , for in my own breast I am still the same to you , and ever will be . But what I do is not done for myself . ”
328104	328112	328114	328114	Florence	197	“ Is it for me , Mama ? ”
328116	328121	328123	328123	Edith	481	“ It is enough , ”
328129	328176	328123	328123	Edith	481	“ to know what it is ; why , matters little . Dear Florence , it is better — it is necessary — it must be — that our association should be less frequent . The confidence there has been between us must be broken off . ”
328177	328180	328182	328182	Florence	197	“ When ? ”
328184	328191	328182	328182	Florence	197	“ Oh , Mama , when ? ”
328192	328195	328197	328197	Edith	481	“ Now , ”
328199	328206	328208	328208	Florence	197	“ For all time to come ? ”
328210	328217	328219	328219	Edith	481	“ I do not say that , ”
328221	328290	328291	328291	Her	197	“ I do not know that . Nor will I say that companionship between us is , at the best , an ill - assorted and unholy union , of which I might have known no good could come . My way here has been through paths that you will never tread , and my way henceforth may lie — God knows — I do not see it — ”
328426	328429	328431	328431	Florence	197	“ Mama , ”
328435	328464	328431	328431	Florence	197	“ there is a change in you , in more than what you say to me , which alarms me . Let me stay with you a little . ”

328472	328582	328470	328470	Edith	481	“ no , dearest . I am best left alone now , and I do best to keep apart from you , of all else . Ask me no questions , but believe that what I am when I seem fickle or capricious to you , I am not of my own will , or for myself . Believe , though we are stranger to each other than we have been , that I am unchanged to you within . Forgive me for having ever darkened your dark home — I am a shadow on it , I know well — and let us never speak of this again . ”
328583	328586	328588	328588	Florence	197	“ Mama , ”

328598	328608	328610	328610	Edith	481	“ We do this that we may not part , ”
328612	328630	328631	328631	She	481	“ Ask no more . Go , Florence ! My love and my remorse go with you ! ”
328857	328862	328834	328834	she	481	“ Good - night , ”

330377	330451	330367	330368	Mr Dombey	533	“ as you have been my medium of communication with Mrs Dombey on former occasions , and as I choose to preserve the decencies of life , so far as I am individually concerned , I will trouble you to have the goodness to inform Mrs Dombey that if she has no respect for herself , I have some respect for myself , and therefore insist on my arrangements for to - morrow . ”
330452	330460	330462	330462	Edith	481	“ Tell your sovereign master , Sir , ”
330464	330492	330462	330462	Edith	481	“ that I will take leave to speak to him on this subject by - and - bye , and that I will speak to him alone . ”
330493	330499	330501	330502	her husband	874	“ Mr Carker , Madam , ”
330504	330531	330501	330502	her husband	874	“ being in possession of the reason which obliges me to refuse you that privilege , shall be absolved from the delivery of any such message . ”
330549	330557	330559	330559	Edith	481	“ Your daughter is present , Sir , ”
330561	330568	330570	330571	Mr Dombey	533	“ My daughter will remain present , ”
330593	330597	330573	330573	Florence	197	“ My daughter , Madam”—began
330637	330648	330649	330649	she	481	“ I tell you I will speak to you alone , ”
330652	330664	330649	330649	she	481	“ If you are not mad , heed what I say . ”
330665	330676	330678	330679	her husband	874	“ I have authority to speak to you , Madam , ”
330681	330699	330700	330700	She	481	“ when and where I please ; and it is my pleasure to speak here and now . ”
330731	330735	330700	330700	She	481	“ You shall ! ”
330736	330755	330757	330758	Mr Dombey	593	“ I must tell you first , that there is a threatening appearance in your manner , Madam , ”
330760	330767	330768	330768	She	481	“ which does not become you . ”
330834	330842	330844	330845	Mr Dombey	533	“ As to my daughter , Madam , ”
330854	330899	330844	330845	Mr Dombey	533	“ it is by no means inconsistent with her duty to me , that she should know what conduct to avoid . At present you are a very strong example to her of this kind , and I hope she may profit by it . ”
330900	330908	330910	330911	his wife	9766	“ I would not stop you now , ”
330923	330947	330910	330911	his wife	9766	“ I would not rise and go away , and save you the utterance of one word , if the room were burning . ”
331007	331011	331013	331013	he	533	“ Mrs Dombey , ”
331015	331092	331013	331013	he	533	“ it may not be inconsistent with my daughter ’s improvement to know how very much to be lamented , and how necessary to be corrected , a stubborn disposition is , especially when it is indulged in — unthankfully indulged in , I will add — after the gratification of ambition and interest . Both of which , I believe , had some share in inducing you to occupy your present station at this board . ”
331093	331114	331115	331115	she	481	“ No ! I would not rise , and go away , and save you the utterance of one word , ”
331122	331129	331115	331115	she	481	“ if the room were burning . ”
331130	331140	331141	331141	he	533	“ It may be natural enough , Mrs Dombey , ”
331144	331162	331115	331115	she	481	“ that you should be uneasy in the presence of any auditors of these disagreeable truths ; though why”—he
331179	331346	331115	331115	she	481	Florence—“why anyone can give them greater force and point than myself , whom they so nearly concern , I do not pretend to understand . It may be natural enough that you should object to hear , in anybody ’s presence , that there is a rebellious principle within you which you can not curb too soon ; which you must curb , Mrs Dombey ; and which , I regret to say , I remember to have seen manifested — with some doubt and displeasure , on more than one occasion before our marriage — towards your deceased mother . But you have the remedy in your own hands . I by no means forgot , when I began , that my daughter was present , Mrs Dombey . I beg you will not forget , to - morrow , that there are several persons present ; and that , with some regard to appearances , you will receive your company in a becoming manner . ”
331347	331354	331356	331356	Edith	481	“ So it is not enough , ”
331358	331380	331356	331356	Edith	481	“ that you know what has passed between yourself and me ; it is not enough that you can look here , ”
331395	331418	331383	331383	Carker	533	“ and be reminded of the affronts you have put upon me ; it is not enough that you can look here , ”
331435	331602	331421	331421	Florence	197	“ and think of what you have done , and of the ingenious agony , daily , hourly , constant , you have made me feel in doing it ; it is not enough that this day , of all others in the year , is memorable to me for a struggle ( well - deserved , but not conceivable by such as you ) in which I wish I had died ! You add to all this , do you , the last crowning meanness of making her a witness of the depth to which I have fallen ; when you know that you have made me sacrifice to her peace , the only gentle feeling and interest of my life , when you know that for her sake , I would now if I could — but I can not , my soul recoils from you too much — submit myself wholly to your will , and be the meekest vassal that you have ! ”
331709	331715	331717	331718	Mr Dombey	533	“ I understand , Madam , ”
331727	331758	331717	331718	Mr Dombey	533	“ the spirit of opposition that turned your affections in that channel , but they have been met , Mrs Dombey ; they have been met , and turned back ! ”
331759	331765	331766	331766	she	197	“ The worse for you ! ”
331777	331780	331766	331766	she	197	“ Ay ! ”
331790	331816	331782	331782	he	533	“ what is the worse for me , is twenty million times the worse for you . Heed that , if you heed nothing else . ”
331866	331870	331872	331873	Mr Dombey	533	“ Mrs Dombey , ”
331886	331906	331879	331879	he	533	“ you will not conciliate me , or turn me from any purpose , by this course of conduct . ”
331907	331925	331926	331926	she	197	“ It is the only true although it is a faint expression of what is within me , ”
331929	331961	331926	331926	she	197	“ But if I thought it would conciliate you , I would repress it , if it were repressible by any human effort . I will do nothing that you ask . ”
331962	331973	331974	331974	he	533	“ I am not accustomed to ask , Mrs Dombey , ”
331977	331981	331974	331974	he	533	“ I direct . ”
331982	332073	331926	331926	she	197	“ I will hold no place in your house to - morrow , or on any recurrence of to - morrow . I will be exhibited to no one , as the refractory slave you purchased , such a time . If I kept my marriage day , I would keep it as a day of shame . Self - respect ! appearances before the world ! what are these to me ? You have done all you can to make them nothing to me , and they are nothing . ”
332074	332077	332079	332080	Mr Dombey	533	“ Carker , ”
332094	332132	332079	332080	Mr Dombey	533	“ Mrs Dombey is so forgetful of herself and me in all this , and places me in a position so unsuited to my character , that I must bring this state of matters to a close . ”
332133	332139	332141	332141	Edith	481	“ Release me , then , ”
332159	332173	332141	332141	Edith	481	“ from the chain by which I am bound . Let me go . ”
332174	332177	332179	332180	Mr Dombey	533	“ Madam ? ”
332182	332190	332179	332180	Mr Dombey	533	“ Loose me . Set me free ! ”
332191	332194	332195	332195	he	533	“ Madam ? ”
332198	332202	332195	332195	he	533	“ Mrs Dombey ? ”
332203	332207	332209	332209	Edith	481	“ Tell him , ”
332218	332269	332209	332209	Edith	481	“ that I wish for a separation between us . That there had better be one . That I recommend it to him . Tell him it may take place on his own terms — his wealth is nothing to me — but that it can not be too soon . ”
332270	332277	332279	332280	her husband	874	“ Good Heaven , Mrs Dombey ! ”
332286	332389	332279	332280	her husband	874	“ do you imagine it possible that I could ever listen to such a proposition ? Do you know who I am , Madam ? Do you know what I represent ? Did you ever hear of Dombey and Son ? People to say that Mr Dombey — Mr Dombey!—was separated from his wife ! Common people to talk of Mr Dombey and his domestic affairs ! Do you seriously think , Mrs Dombey , that I would permit my name to be banded about in such connexion ? Pooh , pooh , Madam ! Fie for shame ! You ’re absurd . ”
332443	332449	332450	332450	he	533	“ No , Mrs Dombey , ”
332453	332498	332450	332450	he	533	“ No , Madam . There is no possibility of separation between you and me , and therefore I the more advise you to be awakened to a sense of duty . And , Carker , as I was about to say to you — ”
332525	332536	332513	332513	his	533	“ — As I was about to say to you , ”
332541	332757	332538	332539	Mr Dombey	533	“ I must beg you , now that matters have come to this , to inform Mrs Dombey , that it is not the rule of my life to allow myself to be thwarted by anybody — anybody , Carker — or to suffer anybody to be paraded as a stronger motive for obedience in those who owe obedience to me than I am my self . The mention that has been made of my daughter , and the use that is made of my daughter , in opposition to me , are unnatural . Whether my daughter is in actual concert with Mrs Dombey , I do not know , and do not care ; but after what Mrs Dombey has said today , and my daughter has heard today , I beg you to make known to Mrs Dombey , that if she continues to make this house the scene of contention it has become , I shall consider my daughter responsible in some degree , on that lady ’s own avowal , and shall visit her with my severe displeasure . Mrs Dombey has asked ‘ whether it is not enough , ’ that she had done this and that . You will please to answer no , it is not enough . ”
332758	332762	332764	332764	Carker	533	“ A moment ! ”
332768	332795	332764	332764	Carker	533	“ permit me ! painful as my position is , at the best , and unusually painful in seeming to entertain a different opinion from you , ”
332800	332841	332844	332844	his	533	“ I must ask , had you not better reconsider the question of a separation . I know how incompatible it appears with your high public position , and I know how determined you are when you give Mrs Dombey to understand”—the
332864	332979	332850	332850	he	533	bells—“that nothing but death can ever part you . Nothing else . But when you consider that Mrs Dombey , by living in this house , and making it as you have said , a scene of contention , not only has her part in that contention , but compromises Miss Dombey every day ( for I know how determined you are ) , will you not relieve her from a continual irritation of spirit , and a continual sense of being unjust to another , almost intolerable ? Does this not seem like — I do not say it is — sacrificing Mrs Dombey to the preservation of your preeminent and unassailable position ? ”
333009	333012	333014	333015	Mr Dombey	533	“ Carker , ”
333033	333073	333014	333015	Mr Dombey	533	“ you mistake your position in offering advice to me on such a point , and you mistake me ( I am surprised to find ) in the character of your advice . I have no more to say . ”
333074	333077	333079	333079	Carker	533	“ Perhaps , ”
333091	333110	333114	333114	his	533	“ you mistook my position , when you honoured me with the negotiations in which I have been engaged here”—with
333120	333131	333133	333134	the other	10537	“ Not at all , Sir , not at all , ”
333137	333142	333133	333134	the other	10537	“ You were employed — ”
333143	333168	333170	333170	Carker	533	“ Being an inferior person , for the humiliation of Mrs Dombey . I forgot . Oh , yes , it was expressly understood ! ”
333172	333178	333180	333180	he	533	“ I beg your pardon ! ”
333982	333989	333990	333990	she	481	“ Do n’t come near me ! ”
333993	334002	333990	333990	she	481	“ Keep away ! Let me go by ! ”
334003	334006	334008	334008	Florence	197	“ Mama ! ”
334010	334031	334008	334008	Florence	197	“ Do n’t call me by that name ! Do n’t speak to me ! Do n’t look at me!—Florence ! ”
334043	334049	334036	334036	Florence	197	“ do n’t touch me ! ”
334155	334160	334146	334147	Mrs Pipchin	307	“ Where is Mama ? ”
334166	334172	334174	334175	Mrs Pipchin	307	“ Gone out to dinner , ”
334177	334181	334174	334175	Mrs Pipchin	307	“ And Papa ? ”
334182	334194	334196	334197	Mrs Pipchin	307	“ Mr Dombey is in his own room , Miss Dombey , ”
334199	334221	334196	334197	Mrs Pipchin	307	“ and the best thing you can do , is to take off your things and go to bed this minute . ”
335036	335044	335024	335024	She	197	“ But what ! what was it ? ”
335054	335068	335051	335052	a madman	7567	“ But the inner dressing - room was locked and the key gone . ”
335739	335746	335732	335732	her	197	“ Oh dear , dear Papa ! ”
336508	336543	336544	336544	Florence	197	“ Oh , Di ! oh , dear , true , faithful Di , how did you come here ? How could I ever leave you , Di , who would never leave me ? ”
337023	337030	337032	337033	the Captain	10100	“ It ’s Heart ’s Delight ! ”
337041	337051	337032	337033	the Captain	10100	“ It ’s the sweet creetur grow’d a woman ! ”
337094	337100	337102	337103	the Captain	10100	“ My Heart ’s Delight ! ”
337122	337136	337102	337103	the Captain	10100	“ If you can hail Ned Cuttle with a finger , do it ! ”
337143	337149	337151	337153	the trembling Captain	7649	“ My Heart ’s Delight ! ”
337155	337160	337151	337153	the trembling Captain	7649	“ For the sake of Wal”r
337180	337307	337151	337153	the trembling Captain	7649	” Finding her insensible to this impressive adjuration also , Captain Cuttle snatched from his breakfast - table a basin of cold water , and sprinkled some upon her face . Yielding to the urgency of the case , the Captain then , using his immense hand with extraordinary gentleness , relieved her of her bonnet , moistened her lips and forehead , put back her hair , covered her feet with his own coat which he pulled off for the purpose , patted her hand — so small in his , that he was struck with wonder when he touched it — and seeing that her eyelids quivered , and that her lips began to move , continued these restorative applications with a better heart . “
337310	337315	337151	337153	the trembling Captain	7649	” said the Captain . “
337358	337363	337365	337365	you	7651	” said the Captain . “
337379	337448	337452	337453	my pretty	9935	” At this stage of her recovery , Captain Cuttle , with an imperfect association of a Watch with a Physician ’s treatment of a patient , took his own down from the mantel - shelf , and holding it out on his hook , and taking Florence ’s hand in his , looked steadily from one to the other , as expecting the dial to do something . “
337455	337460	337452	337453	my pretty	9935	” said the Captain . “
337478	337496	337465	337465	You	7651	” said the Captain , under his breath , and throwing an approving glance upon his watch . “
337539	337540	337541	337542	Captain Cuttle	392	” “
337548	337557	337546	337546	you	392	” exclaimed Florence , raising herself a little . “
337566	337596	337546	337546	you	392	” said the Captain , hastily deciding in his own mind upon the superior elegance of that form of address , as the most courtly he could think of . “
337603	337607	337598	337598	Walter	293	” asked Florence . “
337612	337617	337618	337618	He	3426	” returned the Captain . “
337642	337646	337648	337649	the Captain	10100	Wal”r . But , ”
337655	337673	337648	337649	the Captain	10100	“ Though lost to sight , to memory dear , and England , Home , and Beauty ! ”
337674	337680	337682	337682	Florence	197	“ Do you live here ? ”
337684	337691	337693	337694	the Captain	10100	“ Yes , my lady lass , ”
337696	337702	337704	337704	Florence	197	“ Oh , Captain Cuttle ! ”
337715	337765	337704	337704	Florence	197	“ Save me ! keep me here ! Let no one know where I am ! I ’ll tell you what has happened by - and - by , when I can . I have no one in the world to go to . Do not send me away ! ”
337766	337775	337777	337778	the Captain	10100	“ Send you away , my lady lass ! ”
337780	337809	337777	337778	the Captain	10100	“ You , my Heart ’s Delight ! Stay a bit ! We ’ll put up this here deadlight , and take a double turn on the key ! ”
337946	337951	337953	337954	the Captain	10100	“ My lady lass , ”
337972	338044	337953	337954	the Captain	10100	“ do n’t you say a word to Ed’ard Cuttle , until such times as you finds yourself a riding smooth and easy ; which wo n’t be today , nor yet to - morrow . And as to giving of you up , or reporting where you are , yes verily , and by God ’s help , so I wo n’t , Church catechism , make a note on ! ”
338068	338072	338046	338047	the Captain	10100	“ yes verily , ”
338166	338169	338171	338172	the Captain	10100	“ Steady ! ”
338174	338201	338171	338172	the Captain	10100	“ Steady ! You ’re too weak to stand , you see , my pretty , and must lie down here again . There , there ! ”
338228	338232	338234	338235	the Captain	10100	“ And now , ”
338237	338278	338234	338235	the Captain	10100	“ you must take some breakfast , lady lass , and the dog shall have some too . And arter that you shall go aloft to old Sol Gills ’s room , and fall asleep there , like a angel . ”
338465	338470	338472	338474	the compassionate Captain	7683	“ Well , well ! ”
338476	338506	338472	338474	the compassionate Captain	7683	“ arter turning in , my Heart ’s Delight , you ’ll get more way upon you . Now , I ’ll serve out your allowance , my lad . ”
338510	338521	338472	338474	the compassionate Captain	7683	“ And you shall keep guard on your mistress aloft . ”
338592	338599	338601	338601	Florence	197	“ Can there be anybody there ! ”
338606	338613	338615	338616	the Captain	10100	“ No , my lady lass , ”
338618	338644	338615	338616	the Captain	10100	“ Who ’d stay there , without making any noise ! Keep up a good heart , pretty . It ’s only people going by . ”
338733	338743	338745	338745	Florence	197	“ If there should be someone listening and watching , ”
338747	338760	338745	338745	Florence	197	“ Someone who saw me come — who followed me , perhaps . ”
338761	338775	338777	338778	the Captain	10100	“ It ai n’t the young woman , lady lass , is it ? ”
338786	338789	338791	338791	Florence	197	“ Susan ? ”
338797	338811	338791	338791	Florence	197	“ Ah no ! Susan has been gone from me a long time . ”
338812	338819	338821	338822	the Captain	10100	“ Not deserted , I hope ? ”
338824	338839	338821	338822	the Captain	10100	“ Do n’t say that that there young woman ’s run , my pretty ! ”
338840	338847	338849	338849	Florence	197	“ Oh , no , no ! ”
338851	338863	338849	338849	Florence	197	“ She is one of the truest hearts in the world ! ”
338920	338932	338934	338935	the Captain	10100	“ So you ’re quiet now , are you , brother ? ”
338939	338952	338934	338935	the Captain	10100	“ There warn’t nobody there , my lady lass , bless you ! ”
339273	339278	339280	339281	the Captain	10100	“ My lady lass ! ”
339283	339389	339280	339281	the Captain	10100	“ you ’re as safe here as if you was at the top of St Paul ’s Cathedral , with the ladder cast off . Sleep is what you want , afore all other things , and may you be able to show yourself smart with that there balsam for the still small woice of a wounded mind ! When there ’s anything you want , my Heart ’s Delight , as this here humble house or town can offer , pass the word to Ed’ard Cuttle , as’ll stand off and on outside that door , and that there man will wibrate with joy . ”
339498	339506	339513	339514	The Captain	10100	“ How de do , Captain Gills ? ”
339533	339542	339544	339545	the Captain	10100	“ How are , you , my lad ? ”
339547	339560	339562	339563	Mr Toots	504	“ Well , I ’m pretty well , thank’ee , Captain Gills , ”
339565	339593	339562	339563	Mr Toots	504	“ You know I ’m never quite what I could wish to be , now . I do n’t expect that I ever shall be any more . ”
339625	339629	339631	339632	Mr Toots	504	“ Captain Gills , ”
339634	339654	339631	339632	Mr Toots	504	“ if I could have the pleasure of a word with you , it’s — it ’s rather particular . ”
339655	339664	339666	339667	the Captain	10100	“ Why , you see , my lad , ”
339676	339705	339666	339667	the Captain	10100	“ I ai n’t what you may call exactly free this morning ; and therefore if you can clap on a bit , I should take it kindly . ”
339706	339712	339714	339715	Mr Toots	504	“ Certainly , Captain Gills , ”
339728	339744	339714	339715	Mr Toots	504	“ To clap on , is exactly what I could wish to do . Naturally . ”
339745	339753	339755	339756	the Captain	10100	“ If so be , my lad , ”
339758	339762	339755	339756	the Captain	10100	“ Do it ! ”
339887	339911	339884	339884	he	504	“ I beg your pardon , Captain Gills , but you do n’t happen to see anything particular in me , do you ? ”
339912	339918	339920	339921	the Captain	10100	“ No , my lad , ”
339923	339926	339884	339884	he	504	“ No . ”
339927	339932	339934	339935	Mr Toots	504	“ Because you know , ”
339940	340030	339934	339935	Mr Toots	504	“ I know I ’m wasting away . You need n’t at all mind alluding to that . I — I should like it . Burgess and Co. have altered my measure , I ’m in that state of thinness . It ’s a gratification to me . I — I’m glad of it . I — I’d a great deal rather go into a decline , if I could . I ’m a mere brute you know , grazing upon the surface of the earth , Captain Gills . ”
340106	340117	340119	340120	Mr Toots	504	“ But I was going to say , Captain Gills , ”
340122	340182	340119	340120	Mr Toots	504	“ Happening to be this way early this morning — to tell you the truth , I was coming to breakfast with you . As to sleep , you know , I never sleep now . I might be a Watchman , except that I do n’t get any pay , and he ’s got nothing on his mind . ”
340183	340190	340192	340193	the Captain	10100	“ Carry on , my lad ! ”
340200	340206	340208	340209	Mr Toots	504	“ Certainly , Captain Gills , ”
340211	340237	340208	340209	Mr Toots	504	“ Perfectly true ! Happening to be this way early this morning ( an hour or so ago ) , and finding the door shut — ”
340238	340248	340250	340251	the Captain	10100	“ What ! were you waiting there , brother ? ”
340253	340261	340263	340264	Mr Toots	504	“ Not at all , Captain Gills , ”
340266	340301	340302	340303	The Captain	10100	“ I did n’t stop a moment . I thought you were out . But the person said — by the bye , you do n’t keep a dog , you , Captain Gills ? ”
340308	340313	340315	340316	Mr Toots	504	“ To be sure , ”
340318	340352	340315	340316	Mr Toots	504	“ that ’s exactly what I said . I knew you did n’t . There is a dog , Captain Gills , connected with — but excuse me . That ’s forbidden ground . ”
340403	340408	340410	340411	Mr Toots	504	“ The person said , ”
340413	340451	340410	340411	Mr Toots	504	“ that he had heard a dog barking in the shop : which I knew could n’t be , and I told him so . But he was as positive as if he had seen the dog . ”
340452	340459	340461	340462	the Captain	10100	“ What person , my lad ? ”
340464	340476	340478	340479	Mr Toots	504	“ Why , you see there it is , Captain Gills , ”
340492	340555	340556	340557	The Captain	10100	“ It ’s not for me to say what may have taken place , or what may not have taken place . Indeed , I do n’t know . I get mixed up with all sorts of things that I do n’t quite understand , and I think there ’s something rather weak in my — in my head , in short . ”
340568	340580	340582	340583	Mr Toots	504	“ But the person said , as we were walking away , ”
340585	340626	340582	340583	Mr Toots	504	“ that you knew what , under existing circumstances , might occur — he said ‘ might , ’ very strongly — and that if you were requested to prepare yourself , you would , no doubt , come prepared . ”
340627	340632	340633	340634	the Captain	10100	“ Person , my lad ”
340637	340652	340654	340655	Mr Toots	504	“ I do n’t know what person , I ’m sure , Captain Gills , ”
340657	340835	340836	340837	The Captain	10100	“ I have n’t the least idea . But coming to the door , I found him waiting there ; and he said was I coming back again , and I said yes ; and he said did I know you , and I said , yes , I had the pleasure of your acquaintance — you had given me the pleasure of your acquaintance , after some persuasion ; and he said , if that was the case , would I say to you what I have said , about existing circumstances and coming prepared , and as soon as ever I saw you , would I ask you to step round the corner , if it was only for one minute , on most important business , to Mr Brogley ’s the Broker ’s . Now , I tell you what , Captain Gills — whatever it is , I am convinced it ’s very important ; and if you like to step round , now , I ’ll wait here till you come back . ”
340975	340980	340982	340983	the Captain	10100	“ If so be , ”
340996	341008	340982	340983	the Captain	10100	“ as you ’ll excuse my doing of it , brother . ”
341009	341013	341015	341016	Mr Toots	504	“ Captain Gills , ”
341018	341028	341015	341016	Mr Toots	504	“ whatever you do , is satisfactory to me . ”
341212	341216	341218	341218	Toots	504	“ Captain Gills , ”
341222	341232	341218	341218	Toots	504	“ I hope and trust there ’s nothing wrong ? ”
341233	341243	341245	341246	the Captain	10100	“ Thank’ee , my lad , not a bit , ”
341248	341252	341245	341246	the Captain	10100	“ Quite contrairy . ”
341253	341265	341267	341268	Mr Toots	504	“ You have the appearance of being overcome , Captain Gills , ”
341270	341281	341282	341283	the Captain	10100	“ Why , my lad , I am took aback , ”
341286	341290	341282	341283	the Captain	10100	“ I am . ”
341291	341302	341304	341305	Mr Toots	504	“ Is there anything I can do , Captain Gills ? ”
341307	341317	341318	341319	The Captain	10100	“ If there is , make use of me . ”
341351	341356	341358	341359	the Captain	10100	“ No , thank’ee , ”
341361	341386	341358	341359	the Captain	10100	“ Nothing . Only I ’ll take it as a favour if you ’ll part company for the present . I believe , brother , ”
341392	341396	341358	341359	the Captain	10100	“ that , after Wal”r
341414	341415	341404	341404	you	10100	” “
341425	341443	341422	341423	Captain Gills	527	” returned Mr Toots , giving the Captain ’s hand a preliminary slap before shaking it again , “
341457	341458	341455	341455	Thank’ee	406	” “
341467	341478	341455	341455	Thank’ee	406	” said the Captain , patting him on the back . “
341492	341493	341498	341499	Captain Gills	527	” “
341501	341507	341498	341499	Captain Gills	527	” replied Mr Toots gravely . “
341632	342424	342425	342426	My pretty	9935	” Captain Cuttle cordially reciprocating the warmth of Mr Toots ’s farewell , locked the door behind him , and shaking his head with the same remarkable expression of pity and tenderness as he had regarded him with before , went up to see if Florence wanted him . There was an entire change in the Captain ’s face as he went upstairs . He wiped his eyes with his handkerchief , and he polished the bridge of his nose with his sleeve as he had done already that morning , but his face was absolutely changed . Now , he might have been thought supremely happy ; now , he might have been thought sad ; but the kind of gravity that sat upon his features was quite new to them , and was as great an improvement to them as if they had undergone some sublimating process . He knocked softly , with his hook , at Florence ’s door , twice or thrice ; but , receiving no answer , ventured first to peep in , and then to enter : emboldened to take the latter step , perhaps , by the familiar recognition of Diogenes , who , stretched upon the ground by the side of her couch , wagged his tail , and winked his eyes at the Captain , without being at the trouble of getting up . She was sleeping heavily , and moaning in her sleep ; and Captain Cuttle , with a perfect awe of her youth , and beauty , and her sorrow , raised her head , and adjusted the coat that covered her , where it had fallen off , and darkened the window a little more that she might sleep on , and crept out again , and took his post of watch upon the stairs . All this , with a touch and tread as light as Florence ’s own . Long may it remain in this mixed world a point not easy of decision , which is the more beautiful evidence of the Almighty ’s goodness — the delicate fingers that are formed for sensitiveness and sympathy of touch , and made to minister to pain and grief , or the rough hard Captain Cuttle hand , that the heart teaches , guides , and softens in a moment ! Florence slept upon her couch , forgetful of her homelessness and orphanage , and Captain Cuttle watched upon the stairs . A louder sob or moan than usual , brought him sometimes to her door ; but by degrees she slept more peacefully , and the Captain ’s watch was undisturbed . CHAPTER XLIX . The Midshipman makes a Discovery It was long before Florence awoke . The day was in its prime , the day was in its wane , and still , uneasy in mind and body , she slept on ; unconscious of her strange bed , of the noise and turmoil in the street , and of the light that shone outside the shaded window . Perfect unconsciousness of what had happened in the home that existed no more , even the deep slumber of exhaustion could not produce . Some undefined and mournful recollection of it , dozing uneasily but never sleeping , pervaded all her rest . A dull sorrow , like a half - lulled sense of pain , was always present to her ; and her pale cheek was oftener wet with tears than the honest Captain , softly putting in his head from time to time at the half - closed door , could have desired to see it . The sun was getting low in the west , and , glancing out of a red mist , pierced with its rays opposite loopholes and pieces of fretwork in the spires of city churches , as if with golden arrows that struck through and through them — and far away athwart the river and its flat banks , it was gleaming like a path of fire — and out at sea it was irradiating sails of ships — and , looked towards , from quiet churchyards , upon hill - tops in the country , it was steeping distant prospects in a flush and glow that seemed to mingle earth and sky together in one glorious suffusion — when Florence , opening her heavy eyes , lay at first , looking without interest or recognition at the unfamiliar walls around her , and listening in the same regardless manner to the noises in the street . But presently she started up upon her couch , gazed round with a surprised and vacant look , and recollected all . “
342428	342438	342425	342426	My pretty	9935	” said the Captain , knocking at the door , “
342442	342443	342444	342445	Dear friend	7754	” “
342447	342455	342458	342458	you	0	” cried Florence , hurrying to him , “
342460	342504	342458	342458	you	0	” The Captain felt so much pride in the name , and was so pleased by the gleam of pleasure in her face , when she saw him , that he kissed his hook , by way of reply , in speechless gratification . “
342511	342516	342508	342509	bright di’mond	7755	” said the Captain . “
342524	342528	342517	342517	I	0	” returned Florence . “
342537	342538	342531	342531	I	0	” “
342548	342553	342531	342531	I	0	” replied the Captain . “
342565	342569	342576	342577	my pretty	9935	” asked Florence . “
342579	342592	342576	342577	my pretty	9935	” said the Captain , drawing back the curtain of the window . “
342595	342777	342576	342577	my pretty	9935	” Florence , with her hand upon the Captain ’s arm , so sorrowful and timid , and the Captain with his rough face and burly figure , so quietly protective of her , stood in the rosy light of the bright evening sky , without saying a word . However strange the form of speech into which he might have fashioned the feeling , if he had had to give it utterance , the Captain felt , as sensibly as the most eloquent of men could have done , that there was something in the tranquil time and in its softened beauty that would make the wounded heart of Florence overflow ; and that it was better that such tears should have their way . So not a word spake Captain Cuttle . But when he felt his arm clasped closer , and when he felt the lonely head come nearer to it , and lay itself against his homely coarse blue sleeve , he pressed it gently with his rugged hand , and understood it , and was understood . “
342784	342789	342794	342794	I	0	” said the Captain . “
342828	343651	343652	343654	My lady lass	7657	” As Florence assured him that she was quite able to walk downstairs , the Captain , though evidently doubtful of his own hospitality in permitting it , left her to do so , and immediately set about roasting a fowl at the fire in the little parlour . To achieve his cookery with the greater skill , he pulled off his coat , tucked up his wristbands , and put on his glazed hat , without which assistant he never applied himself to any nice or difficult undertaking . After cooling her aching head and burning face in the fresh water which the Captain ’s care had provided for her while she slept , Florence went to the little mirror to bind up her disordered hair . Then she knew — in a moment , for she shunned it instantly , that on her breast there was the darkening mark of an angry hand . Her tears burst forth afresh at the sight ; she was ashamed and afraid of it ; but it moved her to no anger against him . Homeless and fatherless , she forgave him everything ; hardly thought that she had need to forgive him , or that she did ; but she fled from the idea of him as she had fled from the reality , and he was utterly gone and lost . There was no such Being in the world . What to do , or where to live , Florence — poor , inexperienced girl!—could not yet consider . She had indistinct dreams of finding , a long way off , some little sisters to instruct , who would be gentle with her , and to whom , under some feigned name , she might attach herself , and who would grow up in their happy home , and marry , and be good to their old governess , and perhaps entrust her , in time , with the education of their own daughters . And she thought how strange and sorrowful it would be , thus to become a grey - haired woman , carrying her secret to the grave , when Florence Dombey was forgotten . But it was all dim and clouded to her now . She only knew that she had no Father upon earth , and she said so , many times , with her suppliant head hidden from all , but her Father who was in Heaven . Her little stock of money amounted to but a few guineas . With a part of this , it would be necessary to buy some clothes , for she had none but those she wore . She was too desolate to think how soon her money would be gone — too much a child in worldly matters to be greatly troubled on that score yet , even if her other trouble had been less . She tried to calm her thoughts and stay her tears ; to quiet the hurry in her throbbing head , and bring herself to believe that what had happened were but the events of a few hours ago , instead of weeks or months , as they appeared ; and went down to her kind protector . The Captain had spread the cloth with great care , and was making some egg - sauce in a little saucepan : basting the fowl from time to time during the process with a strong interest , as it turned and browned on a string before the fire . Having propped Florence up with cushions on the sofa , which was already wheeled into a warm corner for her greater comfort , the Captain pursued his cooking with extraordinary skill , making hot gravy in a second little saucepan , boiling a handful of potatoes in a third , never forgetting the egg - sauce in the first , and making an impartial round of basting and stirring with the most useful of spoons every minute . Besides these cares , the Captain had to keep his eye on a diminutive frying - pan , in which some sausages were hissing and bubbling in a most musical manner ; and there was never such a radiant cook as the Captain looked , in the height and heat of these functions : it being impossible to say whether his face or his glazed hat shone the brighter . The dinner being at length quite ready , Captain Cuttle dished and served it up , with no less dexterity than he had cooked it . He then dressed for dinner , by taking off his glazed hat and putting on his coat . That done , he wheeled the table close against Florence on the sofa , said grace , unscrewed his hook , screwed his fork into its place , and did the honours of the table . “
343656	343661	343652	343654	My lady lass	7657	” said the Captain , “
343694	343723	343736	343737	lady lass	15895	” all which the Captain ranged symmetrically on a plate , and pouring hot gravy on the whole with the useful spoon , set before his cherished guest . “
343739	343746	343736	343737	lady lass	15895	” observed the Captain , encouragingly , “
343763	343767	343759	343760	my pretty	9935	Wal”r was here — ”
343768	343780	343782	343782	Florence	196	“ Ah ! If I had him for my brother now ! ”
343784	343796	343798	343799	the Captain	10100	“ Do n’t ! do n’t take on , my pretty ! ”
343801	343821	343798	343799	the Captain	10100	“ awast , to obleege me ! He was your nat’ral born friend like , warn’t he , Pet ? ”
343834	343846	343830	343830	She	196	“ Oh , dear , dear Paul ! oh , Walter ! ”
343847	343855	343857	343858	the Captain	10100	“ The wery planks she walked on , ”
343866	343872	343857	343858	the Captain	10100	“ was as high esteemed by Wal”r
343937	343960	343961	343961	Florence	196	Wal”r was here , my lady lass — or if he could be — for he ’s drownded , ai n’t he ? ”
343966	343973	343975	343976	the Captain	10100	“ Yes , yes ; drownded , ”
343980	344034	343975	343976	the Captain	10100	“ as I was saying , if he could be here he ’d beg and pray of you , my precious , to pick a leetle bit , with a look - out for your own sweet health . Whereby , hold your own , my lady lass , as if it was for Wal”r
344047	344091	343975	343976	the Captain	10100	” Florence essayed to eat a morsel , for the Captain ’s pleasure . The Captain , meanwhile , who seemed to have quite forgotten his own dinner , laid down his knife and fork , and drew his chair to the sofa . “
344092	344103	344105	344106	the Captain	10100	Wal”r was a trim lad , warn’t he , precious ? ”
344125	344136	344119	344119	his	10100	“ and a brave lad , and a good lad ? ”
344141	344153	344155	344156	the Captain	10100	“ And he ’s drownded , Beauty , ai n’t he ? ”
344170	344181	344183	344184	the Captain	10100	“ He was older than you , my lady lass , ”
344186	344201	344183	344184	the Captain	10100	“ but you was like two children together , at first ; wam’t you ? ”
344204	344207	344155	344156	the Captain	10100	“ Yes . ”
344208	344210	344155	344156	the Captain	10100	“ And Wal”r
344214	344219	344155	344156	the Captain	10100	” said the Captain . “
344224	344345	344346	344347	Poor Wal”r	264	” The repetition of this inquiry was a curious source of consolation , but it seemed to be one to Captain Cuttle , for he came back to it again and again . Florence , fain to push from her her untasted dinner , and to lie back on her sofa , gave him her hand , feeling that she had disappointed him , though truly wishing to have pleased him after all his trouble , but he held it in his own ( which shook as he held it ) , and appearing to have quite forgotten all about the dinner and her want of appetite , went on growling at intervals , in a ruminating tone of sympathy , “
344347	344359	344155	344156	the Captain	10100	Wal”r . Ay , ay ! Drownded . Ai n’t he ? ”
344864	344866	344841	344841	his	10100	“ Poor Wal”r
344878	345483	345484	345484	niece	7787	” after which he would resume his smoking with infinite gentleness . Unlike as they were externally — and there could scarcely be a more decided contrast than between Florence in her delicate youth and beauty , and Captain Cuttle with his knobby face , his great broad weather - beaten person , and his gruff voice — in simple innocence of the world ’s ways and the world ’s perplexities and dangers , they were nearly on a level . No child could have surpassed Captain Cuttle in inexperience of everything but wind and weather ; in simplicity , credulity , and generous trustfulness . Faith , hope , and charity , shared his whole nature among them . An odd sort of romance , perfectly unimaginative , yet perfectly unreal , and subject to no considerations of worldly prudence or practicability , was the only partner they had in his character . As the Captain sat , and smoked , and looked at Florence , God knows what impossible pictures , in which she was the principal figure , presented themselves to his mind . Equally vague and uncertain , though not so sanguine , were her own thoughts of the life before her ; and even as her tears made prismatic colours in the light she gazed at , so , through her new and heavy grief , she already saw a rainbow faintly shining in the far - off sky . A wandering princess and a good monster in a storybook might have sat by the fireside , and talked as Captain Cuttle and poor Florence talked — and not have looked very much unlike them . The Captain was not troubled with the faintest idea of any difficulty in retaining Florence , or of any responsibility thereby incurred . Having put up the shutters and locked the door , he was quite satisfied on this head . If she had been a Ward in Chancery , it would have made no difference at all to Captain Cuttle . He was the last man in the world to be troubled by any such considerations . So the Captain smoked his pipe very comfortably , and Florence and he meditated after their own manner . When the pipe was out , they had some tea ; and then Florence entreated him to take her to some neighbouring shop , where she could buy the few necessaries she immediately wanted . It being quite dark , the Captain consented : peeping carefully out first , as he had been wo nt to do in his time of hiding from Mrs MacStinger ; and arming himself with his large stick , in case of an appeal to arms being rendered necessary by any unforeseen circumstance . The pride Captain Cuttle had , in giving his arm to Florence , and escorting her some two or three hundred yards , keeping a bright look - out all the time , and attracting the attention of everyone who passed them , by his great vigilance and numerous precautions , was extreme . Arrived at the shop , the Captain felt it a point of delicacy to retire during the making of the purchases , as they were to consist of wearing apparel ; but he previously deposited his tin canister on the counter , and informing the young lady of the establishment that it contained fourteen pound two , requested her , in case that amount of property should not be sufficient to defray the expenses of his niece ’s little outfit — at the word “
345486	345511	345484	345484	niece	7787	” he bestowed a most significant look on Florence , accompanied with pantomime , expressive of sagacity and mystery — to have the goodness to “
345515	345606	345484	345484	niece	7787	” and he would make up the difference from his pocket . Casually consulting his big watch , as a deep means of dazzling the establishment , and impressing it with a sense of property , the Captain then kissed his hook to his niece , and retired outside the window , where it was a choice sight to see his great face looking in from time to time , among the silks and ribbons , with an obvious misgiving that Florence had been spirited away by a back door . “
345611	345646	345607	345609	Dear Captain Cuttle	603	” said Florence , when she came out with a parcel , the size of which greatly disappointed the Captain , who had expected to see a porter following with a bale of goods , “
345671	345672	345668	345668	my	0	” “
345677	345691	345668	345668	my	0	” returned the baffled Captain , looking straight down the street before them , “
345715	345716	345709	345709	I	0	” “
345727	345731	345709	345709	I	0	” said Florence , “
345737	345753	345709	345709	I	0	” The Captain was not at all gratified by this proposal , but he answered , “
345787	345792	345793	345793	I	0	” said the Captain . “
346021	346029	346031	346032	Captain Cuttle	603	“ Good - night , dear heart , ”
346106	346108	346084	346084	he	10100	“ Poor Wal”r
346110	346115	346084	346084	he	10100	” said the Captain . “
346121	346125	346118	346119	poor Walter	293	” sighed Florence . “
346132	346145	346118	346119	poor Walter	293	” said the Captain . Florence shook her head , and sighed . “
346154	346164	346118	346119	poor Walter	293	” said Captain Cuttle , putting out his hand . “
346174	346181	346118	346119	poor Walter	293	” But the Captain lingered still . “
346191	346204	346206	346206	you	603	” said Florence , easily alarmed in her then state of mind . “
346212	346213	346206	346206	you	603	” “
346221	346232	346218	346219	lady lass	15895	” replied the Captain , meeting her eyes in confusion . “
346263	346264	346245	346245	pretty	7661	” “
346267	346284	346245	346245	pretty	7661	” said Florence , shaking her head . The Captain looked at her wistfully , and repeated “
346287	346297	346298	346299	Poor Wal”r	264	” — still lingering , and still showing embarrassment . “
346299	346301	346303	346304	the Captain	10100	Wal”r ! ”
346306	346308	346303	346304	the Captain	10100	“ My Wal”r
346351	346443	346448	346448	he	7810	” Concluding his apostrophe with this abrupt appeal to Florence , the Captain bade her good - night , and descended the stairs , while Florence remained at the top , holding the candle out to light him down . He was lost in the obscurity , and , judging from the sound of his receding footsteps , was in the act of turning into the little parlour , when his head and shoulders unexpectedly emerged again , as from the deep , apparently for no other purpose than to repeat , “
346452	346892	346895	346896	my lad	1268	” For when he had said that in a tone of tender condolence , he disappeared . Florence was very sorry that she should unwittingly , though naturally , have awakened these associations in the mind of her protector , by taking refuge there ; and sitting down before the little table where the Captain had arranged the telescope and song - book , and those other rarities , thought of Walter , and of all that was connected with him in the past , until she could have almost wished to lie down on her bed and fade away . But in her lonely yearning to the dead whom she had loved , no thought of home — no possibility of going back — no presentation of it as yet existing , or as sheltering her father — once entered her thoughts . She had seen the murder done . In the last lingering natural aspect in which she had cherished him through so much , he had been torn out of her heart , defaced , and slain . The thought of it was so appalling to her , that she covered her eyes , and shrunk trembling from the least remembrance of the deed , or of the cruel hand that did it . If her fond heart could have held his image after that , it must have broken ; but it could not ; and the void was filled with a wild dread that fled from all confronting with its shattered fragments — with such a dread as could have risen out of nothing but the depths of such a love , so wronged . She dared not look into the glass ; for the sight of the darkening mark upon her bosom made her afraid of herself , as if she bore about her something wicked . She covered it up , with a hasty , faltering hand , and in the dark ; and laid her weary head down , weeping . The Captain did not go to bed for a long time . He walked to and fro in the shop and in the little parlour , for a full hour , and , appearing to have composed himself by that exercise , sat down with a grave and thoughtful face , and read out of a Prayer - book the forms of prayer appointed to be used at sea . These were not easily disposed of ; the good Captain being a mighty slow , gruff reader , and frequently stopping at a hard word to give himself such encouragement as “
346902	346905	346895	346896	my lad	1268	” or , “
346913	347064	346908	346909	Ed’ard Cuttle	531	” which had a great effect in helping him out of any difficulty . Moreover , his spectacles greatly interfered with his powers of vision . But notwithstanding these drawbacks , the Captain , being heartily in earnest , read the service to the very last line , and with genuine feeling too ; and approving of it very much when he had done , turned in , under the counter ( but not before he had been upstairs , and listened at Florence ’s door ) , with a serene breast , and a most benevolent visage . The Captain turned out several times in the course of the night , to assure himself that his charge was resting quietly ; and once , at daybreak , found that she was awake : for she called to know if it were he , on hearing footsteps near her door . “
347071	347081	346908	346909	Ed’ard Cuttle	531	” replied the Captain , in a growling whisper . “
347089	347096	347083	347083	you	0	” Florence thanked him , and said “
347099	347127	347128	347129	Poor Wal”r	264	” The Captain could not lose so favourable an opportunity of applying his mouth to the keyhole , and calling through it , like a hoarse breeze , “
347129	347137	347128	347129	Poor Wal”r	264	Wal”r ! Drownded , ai n’t he ? ”
347396	347406	347388	347389	the Captain	10100	“ You never was at sea , my own ? ”
347407	347410	347412	347412	Florence	196	“ No , ”
347414	347417	347419	347420	the Captain	10100	“ Ay , ”
347424	347467	347469	347470	the Captain	10100	“ it ’s a almighty element . There ’s wonders in the deep , my pretty . Think on it when the winds is roaring and the waves is rowling . Think on it when the stormy nights is so pitch dark , ”
347478	347598	347469	347470	the Captain	10100	“ as you ca n’t see your hand afore you , excepting when the wiwid lightning reweals the same ; and when you drive , drive , drive through the storm and dark , as if you was a driving , head on , to the world without end , evermore , amen , and when found making a note of . Them ’s the times , my beauty , when a man may say to his messmate ( previously a overhauling of the wollume ) , ‘ A stiff nor’wester ’s blowing , Bill ; hark , do n’t you hear it roar now ! Lord help ’em , how I pitys all unhappy folks ashore now ! ’ ”
347625	347629	347612	347613	the Captain	10100	“ Stand by ! ”
347630	347639	347641	347641	Florence	196	“ Were you ever in a dreadful storm ? ”
347643	347660	347662	347663	the Captain	10100	“ Why ay , my lady lass , I ’ve seen my share of bad weather , ”
347670	347701	347662	347663	the Captain	10100	“ and I ’ve had my share of knocking about ; but — but it ai n’t of myself as I was a meaning to speak . Our dear boy , ”
347707	347708	347710	347710	darling	2757	“ Wal”r
347716	347747	347748	347748	Your	2757	” The Captain spoke in such a trembling voice , and looked at Florence with a face so pale and agitated , that she clung to his hand in affright . “
347753	347757	347758	347758	You	2757	” cried Florence . “
347781	347782	347769	347771	Dear Captain Cuttle	603	” “
347788	347799	347785	347786	Lady lass	15895	” returned the Captain , supporting her with his hand , “
347827	347839	347822	347822	I	0	Wal”r — he’s — he ’s drownded . Ai n’t he ? ”
347861	347874	347876	347877	the Captain	10100	“ There ’s perils and dangers on the deep , my beauty , ”
347879	347970	347972	347973	the Captain	10100	“ and over many a brave ship , and many and many a bould heart , the secret waters has closed up , and never told no tales . But there ’s escapes upon the deep , too , and sometimes one man out of a score,—ah ! maybe out of a hundred , pretty,—has been saved by the mercy of God , and come home after being given over for dead , and told of all hands lost . I — I know a story , Heart ’s Delight , ”
347975	348020	347972	347973	the Captain	10100	“ o ’ this natur , as was told to me once ; and being on this here tack , and you and me sitting alone by the fire , maybe you ’d like to hear me tell it . Would you , deary ? ”
348075	348084	348086	348087	the Captain	10100	“ There ’s nothing there , my beauty , ”
348089	348095	348086	348087	the Captain	10100	“ Do n’t look there . ”
348096	348100	348102	348102	Florence	196	“ Why not ? ”
348155	348167	348169	348170	the Captain	10100	“ The story was about a ship , my lady lass , ”
348172	348215	348169	348170	the Captain	10100	“ as sailed out of the Port of London , with a fair wind and in fair weather , bound for — don’t be took aback , my lady lass , she was only out’ard bound , pretty , only out’ard bound ! ”
348243	348251	348253	348254	the Captain	10100	“ Shall I go on , Beauty ? ”
348256	348263	348265	348265	Florence	196	“ Yes , yes , pray ! ”
348289	348495	348267	348268	The Captain	10100	“ That there unfort’nate ship met with such foul weather , out at sea , as do n’t blow once in twenty year , my darling . There was hurricanes ashore as tore up forests and blowed down towns , and there was gales at sea in them latitudes , as not the stoutest wessel ever launched could live in . Day arter day that there unfort’nate ship behaved noble , I ’m told , and did her duty brave , my pretty , but at one blow a’most her bulwarks was stove in , her masts and rudder carved away , her best man swept overboard , and she left to the mercy of the storm as had no mercy but blowed harder and harder yet , while the waves dashed over her , and beat her in , and every time they come a thundering at her , broke her like a shell . Every black spot in every mountain of water that rolled away was a bit o ’ the ship ’s life or a living man , and so she went to pieces , Beauty , and no grass will never grow upon the graves of them as manned that ship . ”
348496	348503	348505	348505	Florence	196	“ They were not all lost ! ”
348507	348513	348505	348505	Florence	196	“ Some were saved!—Was one ? ”
348514	348523	348525	348526	the Captain	10100	“ Aboard o ’ that there unfort’nate wessel , ”
348543	348670	348535	348535	his	10100	“ was a lad , a gallant lad — as I ’ve heerd tell — that had loved , when he was a boy , to read and talk about brave actions in shipwrecks — I’ve heerd him ! I ’ve heerd him!—and he remembered of ’em in his hour of need ; for when the stoutest and oldest hands was hove down , he was firm and cheery . It warn’t the want of objects to like and love ashore that gave him courage , it was his nat’ral mind . I ’ve seen it in his face , when he was no more than a child — ay , many a time!—and when I thought it nothing but his good looks , bless him ! ”
348671	348677	348679	348679	Florence	196	“ And was he saved ! ”
348681	348686	348679	348679	Florence	196	“ Was he saved ! ”
348687	348692	348694	348695	the Captain,—“look	16131	“ That brave lad , ”
348695	348706	348707	348707	Florence	196	Captain,—“look at me , pretty ! Do n’t look round — ”
348714	348718	348707	348707	Florence	196	“ Why not ? ”
348719	348729	348731	348732	the Captain	10100	“ Because there ’s nothing there , my deary , ”
348734	348751	348731	348732	the Captain	10100	“ Do n’t be took aback , pretty creetur ! Do n’t , for the sake of Wal”r
348765	348770	348707	348707	Florence	196	” said the Captain , “
348865	348866	348916	348917	the Lord	7850	” “
348871	348875	348916	348917	the Lord	7850	” cried Florence . “
348886	348891	348879	348879	they	7847	” said the Captain , “
348930	348931	348924	348928	two living and one dead	7851	” “
348938	348942	348944	348945	the lad	1626	” cried Florence . “
348950	348955	348946	348946	I	0	” said the Captain . “
348963	348964	348961	348961	God	239	” “
348967	348973	348961	348961	God	239	” returned the Captain hurriedly . “
349036	349103	349030	349030	he	7855	” The Captain , without knowing what he did , had cut a slice of bread from the loaf , and put it on his hook ( which was his usual toasting - fork ) , on which he now held it to the fire ; looking behind Florence with great emotion in his face , and suffering the bread to blaze and burn like fuel . “
349107	349111	349030	349030	he	7855	” repeated Florence , “
349115	349116	349030	349030	he	7855	” “
349124	349136	349030	349030	he	7855	” said the Captain , still looking in the same direction , “
349179	349180	349172	349172	he	7855	” “
349189	349195	349172	349172	he	7855	” cried Florence , quickly . “
349198	349203	349172	349172	he	7855	” roared the Captain . “
349223	349313	349172	349172	he	7855	” There was the shadow of a man upon the wall close to her . She started up , looked round , and with a piercing cry , saw Walter Gay behind her ! [ Illustration ] She had no thought of him but as a brother , a brother rescued from the grave ; a shipwrecked brother saved and at her side ; and rushed into his arms . In all the world , he seemed to be her hope , her comfort , refuge , natural protector . “
349325	349348	349323	349323	Walter	293	” The dear remembrance of the plaintive voice that said so , rushed upon her soul , like music in the night . “
349362	349488	349323	349323	Walter	293	” She felt the words , although she could not utter them , and held him in her pure embrace . Captain Cuttle , in a fit of delirium , attempted to wipe his head with the blackened toast upon his hook : and finding it an uncongenial substance for the purpose , put it into the crown of his glazed hat , put the glazed hat on with some difficulty , essayed to sing a verse of Lovely Peg , broke down at the first word , and retired into the shop , whence he presently came back express , with a face all flushed and besmeared , and the starch completely taken out of his shirt - collar , to say these words : “
349489	349511	349512	349513	The Captain	10100	Wal”r , my lad , here is a little bit of property as I should wish to make over , jintly ! ”
350212	350217	350219	350219	Florence	197	“ Going , Walter ! ”
350221	350224	350219	350219	Florence	197	“ Where ? ”
350225	350237	350239	350240	Captain Cuttle	250	“ He slings his hammock for the present , lady lass , ”
350242	350255	350239	350240	Captain Cuttle	250	“ round at Brogley ’s . Within hail , Heart ’s Delight . ”
350256	350268	350270	350270	Florence	197	“ I am the cause of your going away , Walter , ”
350272	350282	350270	350270	Florence	197	“ There is a houseless sister in your place . ”
350283	350288	350290	350290	Walter	293	“ Dear Miss Dombey , ”
350292	350304	350290	350290	Walter	293	hesitating—“if it is not too bold to call you so ! — ”
350305	350308	350309	350309	she	197	“ Walter ! ”
350314	350369	350309	350309	she	197	“ — If anything could make me happier in being allowed to see and speak to you , would it not be the discovery that I had any means on earth of doing you a moment ’s service ! Where would I not go , what would I not do , for your sake ? ”
350378	350384	350386	350386	Walter	293	“ You are so changed , ”
350388	350392	350393	350393	she	197	“ I changed ! ”
350396	350401	350403	350403	Walter	293	“ — To me , ”
350414	350436	350409	350409	he	293	“ changed to me . I left you such a child , and find you — oh ! something so different — ”
350437	350459	350409	350409	he	293	“ But your sister , Walter . You have not forgotten what we promised to each other , when we parted ? ”
350460	350463	350409	350409	he	293	“ Forgotten ! ”
350470	350525	350465	350465	he	293	“ And if you had — if suffering and danger had driven it from your thoughts — which it has not — you would remember it now , Walter , when you find me poor and abandoned , with no home but this , and no friends but the two who hear me speak ! ”
350526	350535	350537	350537	Walter	293	“ I would ! Heaven knows I would ! ”
350539	350544	350546	350546	Florence	197	“ Oh , Walter , ”
350554	350612	350546	350546	Florence	197	“ Dear brother ! Show me some way through the world — some humble path that I may take alone , and labour in , and sometimes think of you as one who will protect and care for me as for a sister ! Oh , help me , Walter , for I need help so much ! ”
350613	350637	350651	350651	her	7880	“ Miss Dombey ! Florence ! I would die to help you . But your friends are proud and rich . Your father — ”
350638	350645	350646	350646	She	7880	“ No , no ! Walter ! ”
350670	350677	350651	350651	her	7880	“ Do n’t say that word ! ”
350841	350846	350848	350849	the Captain	10100	“ There , precious ! ”
350882	350890	350877	350877	his	10100	“ Awast , awast , my eyes ! Wal”r
350908	351055	351056	351056	Drownded	601	” Walter took her hand in both of his , and put it to his lips , and kissed it . He knew now that she was , indeed , a homeless wandering fugitive ; but , richer to him so , than in all the wealth and pride of her right station , she seemed farther off than even on the height that had made him giddy in his boyish dreams . Captain Cuttle , perplexed by no such meditations , guarded Florence to her room , and watched at intervals upon the charmed ground outside her door — for such it truly was to him — until he felt sufficiently easy in his mind about her , to turn in under the counter . On abandoning his watch for that purpose , he could not help calling once , rapturously , through the keyhole , “
351062	351351	351060	351060	he	7887	pretty?”—or , when he got downstairs , making another trial at that verse of Lovely Peg . But it stuck in his throat somehow , and he could make nothing of it ; so he went to bed , and dreamed that old Sol Gills was married to Mrs MacStinger , and kept prisoner by that lady in a secret chamber on a short allowance of victuals . CHAPTER L. Mr Toots ’s Complaint There was an empty room above - stairs at the wooden Midshipman ’s , which , in days of yore , had been Walter ’s bedroom . Walter , rousing up the Captain betimes in the morning , proposed that they should carry thither such furniture out of the little parlour as would grace it best , so that Florence might take possession of it when she rose . As nothing could be more agreeable to Captain Cuttle than making himself very red and short of breath in such a cause , he turned to ( as he himself said ) with a will ; and , in a couple of hours , this garret was transformed into a species of land - cabin , adorned with all the choicest moveables out of the parlour , inclusive even of the Tartar frigate , which the Captain hung up over the chimney - piece with such extreme delight , that he could do nothing for half - an - hour afterwards but walk backward from it , lost in admiration . The Captain could be induced by no persuasion of Walter ’s to wind up the big watch , or to take back the canister , or to touch the sugar - tongs and teaspoons . “
351359	351373	351060	351060	he	7887	” was the Captain ’s invariable reply to any solicitation of the kind , “
351385	351780	351374	351374	I	0	” These words he repeated with great unction and gravity , evidently believing that they had the virtue of an Act of Parliament , and that unless he committed himself by some new admission of ownership , no flaw could be found in such a form of conveyance . It was an advantage of the new arrangement , that besides the greater seclusion it afforded Florence , it admitted of the Midshipman being restored to his usual post of observation , and also of the shop shutters being taken down . The latter ceremony , however little importance the unconscious Captain attached to it , was not wholly superfluous ; for , on the previous day , so much excitement had been occasioned in the neighbourhood , by the shutters remaining unopened , that the Instrument - maker ’s house had been honoured with an unusual share of public observation , and had been intently stared at from the opposite side of the way , by groups of hungry gazers , at any time between sunrise and sunset . The idlers and vagabonds had been particularly interested in the Captain ’s fate ; constantly grovelling in the mud to apply their eyes to the cellar - grating , under the shop - window , and delighting their imaginations with the fancy that they could see a piece of his coat as he hung in a corner ; though this settlement of him was stoutly disputed by an opposite faction , who were of opinion that he lay murdered with a hammer , on the stairs . It was not without exciting some discontent , therefore , that the subject of these rumours was seen early in the morning standing at his shop - door as hale and hearty as if nothing had happened ; and the beadle of that quarter , a man of an ambitious character , who had expected to have the distinction of being present at the breaking open of the door , and of giving evidence in full uniform before the coroner , went so far as to say to an opposite neighbour , that the chap in the glazed hat had better not try it on there — without more particularly mentioning what — and further , that he , the beadle , would keep his eye upon him . “
351784	351818	351781	351782	Captain Cuttle	250	” said Walter , musing , when they stood resting from their labours at the shop - door , looking down the old familiar street ; it being still early in the morning ; “
351831	351832	351823	351824	Uncle Sol	250	” “
351840	351849	351837	351838	my lad	1268	” replied the Captain , shaking his head . “
351862	351866	351837	351838	my lad	1268	” said Walter : “
351891	351911	351877	351877	He	250	” taking the paper from his pocket , which had been opened in the presence of the enlightened Bunsby , “
352010	352048	352055	352055	wery	7895	” The Captain , who had never climbed to such a clear height of probability before , was greatly impressed by the wide prospect it opened , and answered , with a thoughtful shake of his head , “
352059	352060	352055	352055	wery	7895	” “
352073	352079	352061	352061	I	0	” said Walter , colouring , “
352187	352203	352209	352209	I	0	him,”—Walter ’s voice was indistinct and husky here , and he looked away , along the street,—“leaving
352361	352398	352355	352355	I	0	” Captain Cuttle observed , with a shake of his head , that Jack Bunsby himself had n’t made it out , and that he was a man as could give a pretty taut opinion too . “
352442	352446	352449	352449	he	1553	” said Walter ; “
352500	352501	352494	352494	I	0	” “
352502	352507	352509	352510	the Captain	10100	Wal”r , my lad , ”
352521	352531	352509	352510	the Captain	10100	“ what do you make of it , then ? ”
352532	352536	352494	352494	I	0	“ Captain Cuttle , ”
352540	352565	352538	352538	Walter	293	“ I do n’t know what to make of it . I suppose he never has written ! There is no doubt about that ? ”
352566	352578	352580	352581	the Captain	10100	“ If so be as Sol Gills wrote , my lad , ”
352585	352591	352580	352581	the Captain	10100	“ where ’s his dispatch ? ”
352592	352603	352605	352605	Walter	293	“ Say that he entrusted it to some private hand , ”
352607	352663	352605	352605	Walter	293	“ and that it has been forgotten , or carelessly thrown aside , or lost . Even that is more probable to me , than the other event . In short , I not only can not bear to contemplate that other event , Captain Cuttle , but I ca n’t , and wo n’t . ”
352664	352670	352605	352605	Walter	293	“ Hope , you see , Wal”r
352672	352679	352605	352605	Walter	293	” said the Captain , sagely , “
352736	352741	352734	352734	Hope	468	” said the Captain , “
352771	352845	352759	352759	I	0	” Captain Cuttle said this rather in his character of a sagacious citizen and householder , bound to impart a morsel from his stores of wisdom to an inexperienced youth , than in his own proper person . Indeed , his face was quite luminous as he spoke , with new hope , caught from Walter ; and he appropriately concluded by slapping him on the back ; and saying , with enthusiasm , “
352860	352875	352853	352853	I	0	” Walter , with his cheerful laugh , returned the salutation , and said : “
352915	352916	352889	352889	I	0	” “
352924	352930	352889	352889	I	0	” said the Captain approvingly . “
352942	352943	352934	352934	you	1268	” “
352946	352948	352950	352951	the Captain	10100	Wal”r , ”
352967	353047	352950	352951	the Captain	10100	“ ai n’t I been on the look - out for any tidings of that man o ’ science , old Sol Gills , your Uncle , day and night , ever since I lost him ? Ai n’t my heart been heavy and watchful always , along of him and you ? Sleeping and waking , ai n’t I been upon my post , and would n’t I scorn to quit it while this here Midshipman held together ! ”
353048	353054	353056	353056	Walter	293	“ Yes , Captain Cuttle , ”
353062	353127	353056	353056	Walter	293	“ I know you would , and I know how faithful and earnest all you say and feel is . I am sure of it . You do n’t doubt that I am as sure of it as I am that my foot is again upon this door - step , or that I again have hold of this true hand . Do you ? ”
353128	353133	353056	353056	Walter	293	“ No , no , Wal”r
353135	353143	353056	353056	Walter	293	” returned the Captain , with his beaming “
353151	353172	353144	353144	I	0	” said Walter , fervently shaking the hard hand of the Captain , who shook his with no less goodwill . “
353238	353273	353235	353236	Miss Dombey	287	” There was a change in Walter ’s manner , as he came to these two words ; and when he uttered them , all his confidence and cheerfulness appeared to have deserted him . “
353291	353295	353283	353283	I	0	” said Walter , “
353301	353312	353313	353313	I	0	” The Captain well remembered , and shook his head . “
353316	353320	353313	353313	I	0	” said Walter , “
353354	353360	353283	353283	I	0	” The Captain muttered a feeble “
353363	353366	353283	353283	I	0	” or a “
353370	353411	353283	353283	I	0	” or something or other , equally pertinent to the occasion ; but it was rendered so extremely feeble by the total discomfiture with which he received this announcement , that what it was , is mere matter of conjecture . “
353414	353418	353283	353283	I	0	” said Walter , “
353471	353472	353475	353476	my lad	1268	” “
353478	353490	353475	353476	my lad	1268	” exclaimed the Captain , in a burst of uncontrollable satisfaction . “
353497	353498	353475	353476	my lad	1268	” “
353513	353517	353475	353476	my lad	1268	” said Walter , “
353569	353599	353609	353609	she	287	” Captain Cuttle , without quite understanding this , greatly approved of it , and observed in a tone of strong corroboration , that the wind was quite abaft . “
353614	353620	353609	353609	she	287	” said Walter , anxiously . “
353626	353637	353609	353609	she	287	” replied the Captain , after a little sagacious consideration . “
353660	353661	353655	353655	you	1268	” “
353666	353670	353671	353671	I	0	” remonstrated Walter . “
353741	353742	353715	353715	her	287	” “
353743	353748	353750	353751	the Captain	10100	Wal”r , my lad , ”
353760	353769	353750	353751	the Captain	10100	“ ai n’t there no other character as — ”
353770	353773	353715	353715	her	287	“ Oh ! ”
353777	353860	353715	353715	her	287	“ would you have me die in her esteem — in such esteem as hers — and put a veil between myself and her angel ’s face for ever , by taking advantage of her being here for refuge , so trusting and so unprotected , to endeavour to exalt myself into her lover ? What do I say ? There is no one in the world who would be more opposed to me if I could do so , than you . ”
353861	353862	353750	353751	the Captain	10100	“ Wal”r
353867	353877	353750	353751	the Captain	10100	” said the Captain , drooping more and more , “
353942	353952	353939	353940	my lad	1268	” Walter briskly waved his hand in the negative . “
353958	353964	353939	353940	my lad	1268	” growled the Captain slowly , “
354002	354063	354065	354066	the Captain	10100	Wal”r , mind you , wot ’s respect and duty to her , is respect and duty in my articles , howsumever disapinting ; and therefore I follows in your wake , my lad , and feel as you are , no doubt , acting up to yourself . And there ai n’t no other character , ai n’t there ? ”
354083	354089	354091	354091	Walter	293	“ Now , Captain Cuttle , ”
354118	354174	354182	354183	the Captain	10100	concerned—“I think we should exert ourselves to find someone who would be a proper attendant for Miss Dombey while she remains here , and who may be trusted . None of her relations may . It ’s clear Miss Dombey feels that they are all subservient to her father . What has become of Susan ? ”
354175	354180	354182	354183	the Captain	10100	“ The young woman ? ”
354185	354233	354182	354183	the Captain	10100	“ It ’s my belief as she was sent away again the will of Heart ’s Delight . I made a signal for her when Lady lass first come , and she rated of her wery high , and said she had been gone a long time . ”
354234	354237	354239	354239	Walter	293	“ Then , ”
354241	354296	354239	354239	Walter	293	“ do you ask Miss Dombey where she ’s gone , and we ’ll try to find her . The morning ’s getting on , and Miss Dombey will soon be rising . You are her best friend . Wait for her upstairs , and leave me to take care of all down here . ”
354499	354509	354492	354492	Florence	197	“ Oh , yes , with her whole heart ! ”
354563	354567	354569	354570	Mr Toots	504	“ Captain Gills , ”
354580	354592	354569	354570	Mr Toots	504	“ I ’m in a state of mind bordering on distraction ! ”
354624	354632	354634	354635	Mr Toots	504	“ You ’ll excuse me , Sir , ”
354641	354690	354634	354635	Mr Toots	504	“ but I ’m at present in that state that my brain is going , if not gone , and anything approaching to politeness in an individual so situated would be a hollow mockery . Captain Gills , I beg to request the favour of a private interview . ”
354691	354696	354698	354699	the Captain	10100	“ Why , Brother , ”
354707	354722	354698	354699	the Captain	10100	“ you are the man as we was on the look - out for . ”
354723	354729	354731	354732	Mr Toots	504	“ Oh , Captain Gills , ”
354734	354801	354731	354732	Mr Toots	504	“ what a look - out that must be , of which I am the object ! I have n’t dared to shave , I ’m in that rash state . I have n’t had my clothes brushed . My hair is matted together . I told the Chicken that if he offered to clean my boots , I ’d stretch him a Corpse before me ! ”
354823	354829	354831	354832	the Captain	10100	“ See here , Brother , ”
354834	354843	354831	354832	the Captain	10100	“ This here ’s old Sol Gills ’s nevy Wal”r
354855	354870	354831	354832	the Captain	10100	” Mr Toots took his hand from his forehead , and stared at Walter . “
354875	354880	354873	354873	me	0	” stammered Mr Toots . “
354919	354935	354910	354910	you	504	” He took the Captain by the coat , and going out with him whispered : “
354963	354964	354950	354950	you	504	” “
354972	354978	354979	354979	I	0	” replied the disconsolate Captain ; “
354986	354987	354979	354979	I	0	” “
354993	355006	354979	354979	I	0	” exclaimed Mr Toots , with his hand to his forehead again . “
355023	355041	355016	355016	he	527	” said Mr Toots , stopping short , on second thoughts , and taking away his hand ; “
355068	355087	355063	355063	me	0	” Mr Toots shot back abruptly into the parlour , and said , wringing Walter by the hand : “
355137	355155	355156	355156	I	0	” said Mr Toots , warming as he became better acquainted with Walter ’s face and figure , “
355164	355165	355156	355156	I	0	” “
355171	355175	355156	355156	I	0	” said Walter . “
355187	355188	355176	355176	I	0	” “
355195	355205	355191	355191	you	527	” said Mr Toots , still shaking his hand . “
355253	355268	355245	355245	you	527	” All these good wishes , and better intentions , Walter responded to manfully . “
355272	355277	355269	355270	Captain Gills	527	” said Mr Toots , “
355303	355304	355326	355327	Captain Gills	527	” “
355312	355317	355326	355327	Captain Gills	527	” returned the Captain . “
355322	355323	355326	355327	Captain Gills	527	” “
355329	355334	355326	355327	Captain Gills	527	” said Mr Toots , “
355372	355381	355383	355391	a Brute , that it would be a flattery	7981	” said Mr Toots , with great excitement , “
355421	355422	355424	355424	I	0	” “
355431	355435	355436	355437	Lieutenant Walters	606	” inquired Walter . “
355439	355493	355436	355437	Lieutenant Walters	606	” said Mr Toots , who had arrived at that appellation by a process peculiar to himself ; probably by jumbling up his Christian name with the seafaring profession , and supposing some relationship between him and the Captain , which would extend , as a matter of course , to their titles ; “
355654	355655	355656	355657	Mr Toots	504	” “
355659	355663	355656	355657	Mr Toots	504	” said Walter , “
355686	355687	355688	355688	Sir	735	” “
355690	355706	355688	355688	Sir	735	” cried Mr Toots , starting from his chair and shaking hands with him anew , “
355740	355749	355737	355738	Captain Gills	527	” said Mr Toots , appealing to him , “
355779	355780	355774	355774	I	0	” “
355799	355812	355774	355774	I	0	” said Walter , not at all slow in returning his greeting , “
355838	355999	356000	356001	Oh Di	413	” The Captain beckoned to Mr Toots , who followed him with a bewildered countenance , and , ascending to the top of the house , was introduced , without a word of preparation from his conductor , into Florence ’s new retreat . Poor Mr Toots ’s amazement and pleasure at sight of her were such , that they could find a vent in nothing but extravagance . He ran up to her , seized her hand , kissed it , dropped it , seized it again , fell upon one knee , shed tears , chuckled , and was quite regardless of his danger of being pinned by Diogenes , who , inspired by the belief that there was something hostile to his mistress in these demonstrations , worked round and round him , as if only undecided at what particular point to go in for the assault , but quite resolved to do him a fearful mischief . “
356021	356022	356023	356023	Thankee	319	” “
356025	356030	356023	356023	Thankee	319	” said Mr Toots , “
356055	356100	356101	356102	Captain Gills	527	” Mr Toots said this without the least notion of what he was talking about , and sat down on a chair , staring at Florence with the liveliest contention of delight and despair going on in his face that any face could exhibit . “
356112	356117	356101	356102	Captain Gills	527	” gasped Mr Toots , “
356159	356170	356171	356171	I	0	” said Mr Toots , with severe self - accusation , “
356184	356185	356171	356171	I	0	” “
356191	356195	356188	356189	Mr Toots	504	” said Florence , “
356226	356227	356214	356214	You	504	” “
356231	356236	356214	356214	You	504	” returned Mr Toots , “
356264	356265	356267	356267	we	7992	” “
356273	356277	356267	356267	we	7992	” said Florence , “
356309	356310	356317	356318	Miss Dombey	287	” “
356320	356330	356317	356318	Miss Dombey	287	” said Mr Toots , after a little consideration , “
356411	356486	356487	356488	Miss Dombey	287	” Mr Toots was so manifestly delighted and revived by the prospect of being useful , and the disinterested sincerity of his devotion was so unquestionable , that it would have been cruel to refuse him . Florence , with an instinctive delicacy , forbore to urge the least obstacle , though she did not forbear to overpower him with thanks ; and Mr Toots proudly took the commission upon himself for immediate execution . “
356490	356518	356487	356488	Miss Dombey	287	” said Mr Toots , touching her proffered hand , with a pang of hopeless love visibly shooting through him , and flashing out in his face , “
356593	356663	356585	356585	I	0	” With that Mr Toots came out of the room , again accompanied by the Captain , who , standing at a little distance , holding his hat under his arm and arranging his scattered locks with his hook , had been a not uninterested witness of what passed . And when the door closed behind them , the light of Mr Toots ’s life was darkly clouded again . “
356667	356684	356664	356665	Captain Gills	527	” said that gentleman , stopping near the bottom of the stairs , and turning round , “
356759	356760	356749	356749	you	527	” “
356763	356768	356749	356749	you	527	” returned the Captain , “
356791	356792	356793	356794	Captain Gills	527	” “
356796	356801	356793	356794	Captain Gills	527	” said Mr Toots , “
356821	356838	356840	356840	I	0	” said Mr Toots , standing in the passage , behind the half - opened door , “
356915	357754	357757	357757	he	8003	” Mr Toots said no more , but slipped out quietly and shut the door upon himself , to cut the Captain off from any reply . Florence thought of this good creature , long after he had left her , with mingled emotions of pain and pleasure . He was so honest and warm - hearted , that to see him again and be assured of his truth to her in her distress , was a joy and comfort beyond all price ; but for that very reason , it was so affecting to think that she caused him a moment ’s unhappiness , or ruffled , by a breath , the harmless current of his life , that her eyes filled with tears , and her bosom overflowed with pity . Captain Cuttle , in his different way , thought much of Mr Toots too ; and so did Walter ; and when the evening came , and they were all sitting together in Florence ’s new room , Walter praised him in a most impassioned manner , and told Florence what he had said on leaving the house , with every graceful setting - off in the way of comment and appreciation that his own honesty and sympathy could surround it with . Mr Toots did not return upon the next day , or the next , or for several days ; and in the meanwhile Florence , without any new alarm , lived like a quiet bird in a cage , at the top of the old Instrument - maker ’s house . But Florence drooped and hung her head more and more plainly , as the days went on ; and the expression that had been seen in the face of the dead child , was often turned to the sky from her high window , as if it sought his angel out , on the bright shore of which he had spoken : lying on his little bed . Florence had been weak and delicate of late , and the agitation she had undergone was not without its influences on her health . But it was no bodily illness that affected her now . She was distressed in mind ; and the cause of her distress was Walter . Interested in her , anxious for her , proud and glad to serve her , and showing all this with the enthusiasm and ardour of his character , Florence saw that he avoided her . All the long day through , he seldom approached her room . If she asked for him , he came , again for the moment as earnest and as bright as she remembered him when she was a lost child in the staring streets ; but he soon became constrained — her quick affection was too watchful not to know it — and uneasy , and soon left her . Unsought , he never came , all day , between the morning and the night . When the evening closed in , he was always there , and that was her happiest time , for then she half believed that the old Walter of her childhood was not changed . But , even then , some trivial word , look , or circumstance would show her that there was an indefinable division between them which could not be passed . And she could not but see that these revealings of a great alteration in Walter manifested themselves in despite of his utmost efforts to hide them . In his consideration for her , she thought , and in the earnestness of his desire to spare her any wound from his kind hand , he resorted to innumerable little artifices and disguises . So much the more did Florence feel the greatness of the alteration in him ; so much the oftener did she weep at this estrangement of her brother . The good Captain — her untiring , tender , ever zealous friend — saw it , too , Florence thought , and it pained him . He was less cheerful and hopeful than he had been at first , and would steal looks at her and Walter , by turns , when they were all three together of an evening , with quite a sad face . Florence resolved , at last , to speak to Walter . She believed she knew now what the cause of his estrangement was , and she thought it would be a relief to her full heart , and would set him more at ease , if she told him she had found it out , and quite submitted to it , and did not reproach him . It was on a certain Sunday afternoon , that Florence took this resolution . The faithful Captain , in an amazing shirt - collar , was sitting by her , reading with his spectacles on , and she asked him where Walter was . “
357766	357771	357757	357757	he	8003	” returned the Captain . “
357780	357792	357772	357772	I	0	” said Florence , rising hurriedly as if to go downstairs . “
357802	357807	357800	357800	Beauty	600	” said the Captain , “
357812	357899	357800	357800	Beauty	600	” Thereupon the Captain , with much alacrity , shouldered his book — for he made it a point of duty to read none but very large books on a Sunday , as having a more staid appearance : and had bargained , years ago , for a prodigious volume at a book - stall , five lines of which utterly confounded him at any time , insomuch that he had not yet ascertained of what subject it treated — and withdrew . Walter soon appeared . “
357908	357924	357900	357901	Captain Cuttle	603	” he eagerly began on coming in — but stopped when he saw her face . “
357941	357971	357972	357972	Walter	293	” He spoke so kindly , and with such a fervent tremor in his voice , that the tears gushed into her eyes at the sound of his words . “
357974	357980	357972	357972	Walter	293	” said Florence , gently , “
358000	358027	358028	358028	You	0	” He sat down opposite to her , looking at her beautiful and innocent face ; and his own turned pale , and his lips trembled . “
358060	358078	358056	358056	I	0	” He put his trembling hand upon the table between them , and sat looking at her . “
358125	358166	358113	358113	I	0	” She seemed a child to him again . It was the ingenuous , confiding , loving child he saw and heard . Not the dear woman , at whose feet he would have laid the riches of the earth . “
358183	358199	358172	358172	I	0	” He put his hand into his breast , and took out a little purse . “
358231	358232	358240	358240	Walter	293	” “
358247	358248	358234	358234	you	293	” “
358253	358283	358284	358284	I	0	” She laid her hand on his , as fearlessly and simply , as if not a day had intervened since she gave him the little token of remembrance . “
358329	358330	358302	358302	you	293	” “
358333	358342	358345	358345	Walter	293	” he answered , in a wondering tone . “
358587	358636	358639	358640	Miss Dombey	287	” Walter had looked upon her while she said this , with a face so full of wonder and amazement , that it had room for nothing else . Now he caught up the hand that touched his , so entreatingly , and held it between his own . “
358642	358646	358639	358640	Miss Dombey	287	” he said , “
358822	358823	358824	358824	Walter	293	” “
358826	358841	358824	358824	Walter	293	” said Florence , looking at him earnestly , but with a changing face , “
358865	358866	358910	358911	a brother	9736	” “
358869	358878	358910	358911	a brother	9736	” said Walter , in a low tone . “
358881	358906	358907	358907	I	0	” The colour dawned in her face , and she timidly and thoughtfully withdrew her hand ; still looking at him with unabated earnestness . “
358915	358919	358907	358907	I	0	” said Walter . “
358938	358979	358935	358936	a woman	1577	” The colour overspread her face . She made a gesture as if of entreaty that he would say no more , and her face dropped upon her hands . They were both silent for a time ; she weeping . “
358994	358998	359018	359019	my sister	10239	” said Walter , “
359022	359028	359014	359014	I	0	” She was weeping still . “
359059	359063	359066	359066	you	8022	” said Walter ; “
359114	359115	359118	359118	you	8022	” “
359146	359147	359148	359148	Florence	197	” “
359150	359156	359148	359148	Florence	197	” said Walter , passionately . “
359330	359351	359352	359353	Dear Florence	197	” The head was still bent down , the tears still falling , and the bosom swelling with its sobs . “
359406	359473	359380	359380	me	0	” She raised her head , and spoke to him with such a solemn sweetness in her eyes ; with such a calm , bright , placid smile shining on him through her tears ; with such a low , soft tremble in her frame and voice ; that the innermost chords of his heart were touched , and his sight was dim as he listened . “
359502	359503	359504	359504	I	0	” “
359510	359514	359507	359508	a wanderer	8029	” said Walter , “
359530	359531	359539	359539	Walter	293	” “
359541	359542	359533	359533	you	293	” “
359546	359565	359533	359533	you	293	” She sat looking at him for a moment ; then timidly put her trembling hand in his . “
359657	359904	359907	359908	lady lass	15895	” He caught her to his heart , and laid her cheek against his own , and now , no more repulsed , no more forlorn , she wept indeed , upon the breast of her dear lover . Blessed Sunday Bells , ringing so tranquilly in their entranced and happy ears ! Blessed Sunday peace and quiet , harmonising with the calmness in their souls , and making holy air around them ! Blessed twilight stealing on , and shading her so soothingly and gravely , as she falls asleep , like a hushed child , upon the bosom she has clung to ! Oh load of love and trustfulness that lies to lightly there ! Ay , look down on the closed eyes , Walter , with a proudly tender gaze ; for in all the wide wide world they seek but thee now — only thee ! The Captain remained in the little parlour until it was quite dark . He took the chair on which Walter had been sitting , and looked up at the skylight , until the day , by little and little , faded away , and the stars peeped down . He lighted a candle , lighted a pipe , smoked it out , and wondered what on earth was going on upstairs , and why they did n’t call him to tea . Florence came to his side while he was in the height of his wonderment . “
359910	359915	359907	359908	lady lass	15895	” cried the Captain . “
359920	359933	359934	359934	Florence	197	Wal”r have had a long spell o ’ talk , my beauty . ”
359958	360016	359936	359936	her	197	“ Dear Captain , I want to tell you something , if you please . The Captain raised his head pretty smartly , to hear what it was . Catching by this means a more distinct view of Florence , he pushed back his chair , and himself with it , as far as they could go . “
360023	360031	360019	360019	Heart	533	” cried the Captain , suddenly elated , “
360036	360037	360019	360019	Heart	533	” “
360040	360046	360019	360019	Heart	533	” said Florence , eagerly . “
360047	360053	360055	360056	the Captain	10100	Wal”r ! Husband ! THAT ? ”
360067	360070	360072	360072	Florence	197	“ Yes ! ”
360126	360129	360111	360111	he	10100	“ What , Wal”r
360133	360154	360111	360111	he	10100	” said the Captain , looking in at the door , with his face like an amiable warming - pan . “
360167	360257	360258	360259	Ed’ard Cuttle	531	” He had like to have suffocated himself with this pleasantry , which he repeated at least forty times during tea ; polishing his radiant face with the sleeve of his coat , and dabbing his head all over with his pocket - handkerchief , in the intervals . But he was not without a graver source of enjoyment to fall back upon , when so disposed , for he was repeatedly heard to say in an undertone , as he looked with ineffable delight at Walter and Florence : “
360286	360388	360276	360276	you	1268	” CHAPTER LI . Mr Dombey and the World What is the proud man doing , while the days go by ? Does he ever think of his daughter , or wonder where she is gone ? Does he suppose she has come home , and is leading her old life in the weary house ? No one can answer for him . He has never uttered her name , since . His household dread him too much to approach a subject on which he is resolutely dumb ; and the only person who dares question him , he silences immediately . “
360393	360411	360412	360413	your wife	908	” murmurs his sister , sidling into the room , on the day of Florence ’s departure , “
360469	360525	360465	360465	My	0	” With this speech feelingly reminiscent of her not having been asked to dinner on the day of the first party , Mrs Chick makes great use of her pocket - handkerchief , and falls on Mr Dombey ’s neck . But Mr Dombey frigidly lifts her off , and hands her to a chair . “
360532	360536	360526	360526	I	0	” he says , “
360586	360587	360588	360588	My	0	” “
360592	360609	360588	360588	My	0	” rejoins his sister , with her handkerchief to her face , and shaking her head , “
360629	360644	360588	360588	My	0	” on the heads of which two adjectives , Mrs Chick visits scathing indignation ; “
360670	360671	360672	360672	Louisa	204	” “
360674	360681	360672	360672	Louisa	204	” says her brother , sternly , “
360690	361353	360672	360672	Louisa	204	” Mrs Chick can only shake her head , and use her handkerchief , and moan over degenerate Dombeys , who are no Dombeys . But whether Florence has been inculpated in the flight of Edith , or has followed her , or has done too much , or too little , or anything , or nothing , she has not the least idea . He goes on , without deviation , keeping his thoughts and feelings close within his own breast , and imparting them to no one . He makes no search for his daughter . He may think that she is with his sister , or that she is under his own roof . He may think of her constantly , or he may never think about her . It is all one for any sign he makes . But this is sure ; he does not think that he has lost her . He has no suspicion of the truth . He has lived too long shut up in his towering supremacy , seeing her , a patient gentle creature , in the path below it , to have any fear of that . Shaken as he is by his disgrace , he is not yet humbled to the level earth . The root is broad and deep , and in the course of years its fibres have spread out and gathered nourishment from everything around it . The tree is struck , but not down . Though he hide the world within him from the world without — which he believes has but one purpose for the time , and that , to watch him eagerly wherever he goes — he can not hide those rebel traces of it , which escape in hollow eyes and cheeks , a haggard forehead , and a moody , brooding air . Impenetrable as before , he is still an altered man ; and , proud as ever , he is humbled , or those marks would not be there . [ Illustration ] The world . What the world thinks of him , how it looks at him , what it sees in him , and what it says — this is the haunting demon of his mind . It is everywhere where he is ; and , worse than that , it is everywhere where he is not . It comes out with him among his servants , and yet he leaves it whispering behind ; he sees it pointing after him in the street ; it is waiting for him in his counting - house ; it leers over the shoulders of rich men among the merchants ; it goes beckoning and babbling among the crowd ; it always anticipates him , in every place ; and is always busiest , he knows , when he has gone away . When he is shut up in his room at night , it is in his house , outside it , audible in footsteps on the pavement , visible in print upon the table , steaming to and fro on railroads and in ships ; restless and busy everywhere , with nothing else but him . It is not a phantom of his imagination . It is as active in other people ’s minds as in his . Witness Cousin Feenix , who comes from Baden - Baden , purposely to talk to him . Witness Major Bagstock , who accompanies Cousin Feenix on that friendly mission . Mr Dombey receives them with his usual dignity , and stands erect , in his old attitude , before the fire . He feels that the world is looking at him out of their eyes . That it is in the stare of the pictures . That Mr Pitt , upon the bookcase , represents it . That there are eyes in its own map , hanging on the wall . “
361359	361369	361370	361370	Damme	326	” says Mr Dombey — to deceive the world . “

362136	362150	362153	362153	Dombey	533	” Mr Dombey bows , without raising his eyes , and is silent . “

362573	362769	362567	362567	My	0	” Although this is but a dry reply to the Major ’s purple enthusiasm , the Major receives it graciously , and is delighted to think that the world has such a fair prospect of soon receiving its due . Cousin Feenix is then presented with his meed of acknowledgment by the husband of his lovely and accomplished relative , and Cousin Feenix and Major Bagstock retire , leaving that husband to the world again , and to ponder at leisure on their representation of its state of mind concerning his affairs , and on its just and reasonable expectations . But who sits in the housekeeper ’s room , shedding tears , and talking to Mrs Pipchin in a low tone , with uplifted hands ? It is a lady with her face concealed in a very close black bonnet , which appears not to belong to her . It is Miss Tox , who has borrowed this disguise from her servant , and comes from Princess ’s Place , thus secretly , to revive her old acquaintance with Mrs Pipchin , in order to get certain information of the state of Mr Dombey . “
362780	362785	362772	362772	he	8109	” asks Miss Tox . “
362788	362798	362772	362772	he	8109	” says Mrs Pipchin , in her snappish way , “
362806	362807	362799	362799	he	8109	” “
362810	362814	362799	362799	he	8109	” suggests Miss Tox “
362821	362839	362817	362817	he	8109	” Mrs Pipchin ’s hard grey eye looks doubtful as she answers , in three distinct jerks , “
362848	362849	362844	362844	I	0	” “
362858	362901	362844	362844	I	0	” says Mrs Pipchin ; she still calls Miss Tox Lucretia , on account of having made her first experiments in the child - quelling line of business on that lady , when an unfortunate and weazen little girl of tender years ; “
362931	362932	362929	362929	myself	0	” “
362945	362950	362938	362938	you	8110	” returned Miss Tox . “
362963	362971	362972	362972	I	0	” And here Miss Tox is overcome . “
362983	362993	362972	362972	I	0	” observes Mrs Pipchin ; irascibly rubbing her nose . “
363052	363115	363043	363043	Nobody	795	” This hint of the Peruvian Mines , causes Miss Tox to rise to go away ; when Mrs Pipchin rings the bell for Towlinson to show her out , Mr Towlinson , not having seen Miss Tox for ages , grins , and hopes she ’s well ; observing that he did n’t know her at first , in that bonnet . “
363125	363130	363121	363121	I	0	” says Miss Tox . “
363160	363161	363157	363158	Mrs Pipchin	307	” “
363167	363171	363165	363165	Miss	10202	” says Towlinson . “
363178	363183	363176	363176	Towlinson	272	” says Miss Tox . “
363191	363195	363189	363189	Miss	8117	” rejoins Towlinson . “
363201	363230	363189	363189	Miss	8117	” says Miss Tox , who , in her instruction of the Toodle family , has acquired an admonitorial tone , and a habit of improving passing occasions , “
363246	363247	363244	363244	Towlinson	272	” “
363257	363296	363251	363251	Miss	8118	” says Towlinson . He appears to be falling into a consideration of the manner in which this warning ought to operate in his particular case , when the vinegary Mrs Pipchin , suddenly stirring him up with a “
363313	363976	363978	363978	he	8120	” he ushers Miss Tox forth . As she passes Mr Dombey ’s room , she shrinks into the inmost depths of the black bonnet , and walks , on tip - toe ; and there is not another atom in the world which haunts him so , that feels such sorrow and solicitude about him , as Miss Tox takes out under the black bonnet into the street , and tries to carry home shadowed it from the newly - lighted lamps . But Miss Tox is not a part of Mr Dombey ’s world . She comes back every evening at dusk ; adding clogs and an umbrella to the bonnet on wet nights ; and bears the grins of Towlinson , and the huffs and rebuffs of Mrs Pipchin , and all to ask how he does , and how he bears his misfortune : but she has nothing to do with Mr Dombey ’s world . Exacting and harassing as ever , it goes on without her ; and she , a by no means bright or particular star , moves in her little orbit in the corner of another system , and knows it quite well , and comes , and cries , and goes away , and is satisfied . Verily Miss Tox is easier of satisfaction than the world that troubles Mr Dombey so much ! At the Counting House , the clerks discuss the great disaster in all its lights and shades , but chiefly wonder who will get Mr Carker ’s place . They are generally of opinion that it will be shorn of some of its emoluments , and made uncomfortable by newly - devised checks and restrictions ; and those who are beyond all hope of it are quite sure they would rather not have it , and do n’t at all envy the person for whom it may prove to be reserved . Nothing like the prevailing sensation has existed in the Counting House since Mr Dombey ’s little son died ; but all such excitements there take a social , not to say a jovial turn , and lead to the cultivation of good fellowship . A reconciliation is established on this propitious occasion between the acknowledged wit of the Counting House and an aspiring rival , with whom he has been at deadly feud for months ; and a little dinner being proposed , in commemoration of their happily restored amity , takes place at a neighbouring tavern ; the wit in the chair ; the rival acting as Vice - President . The orations following the removal of the cloth are opened by the Chair , who says , Gentlemen , he ca n’t disguise from himself that this is not a time for private dissensions . Recent occurrences to which he need not more particularly allude , but which have not been altogether without notice in some Sunday Papers , and in a daily paper which he need not name ( here every other member of the company names it in an audible murmur ) , have caused him to reflect ; and he feels that for him and Robinson to have any personal differences at such a moment , would be for ever to deny that good feeling in the general cause , for which he has reason to think and hope that the gentlemen in Dombey ’s House have always been distinguished . Robinson replies to this like a man and a brother ; and one gentleman who has been in the office three years , under continual notice to quit on account of lapses in his arithmetic , appears in a perfectly new light , suddenly bursting out with a thrilling speech , in which he says , May their respected chief never again know the desolation which has fallen on his hearth ! and says a great variety of things , beginning with “
363982	364118	363978	363978	he	8120	” which are received with thunders of applause . In short , a most delightful evening is passed , only interrupted by a difference between two juniors , who , quarrelling about the probable amount of Mr Carker ’s late receipts per annum , defy each other with decanters , and are taken out greatly excited . Soda water is in general request at the office next day , and most of the party deem the bill an imposition . As to Perch , the messenger , he is in a fair way of being ruined for life . He finds himself again constantly in bars of public - houses , being treated and lying dreadfully . It appears that he met everybody concerned in the late transaction , everywhere , and said to them , “
364121	364123	364124	364124	Madam	3633	” or “
364126	364132	364124	364124	Madam	3633	” as the case was , “
364140	364153	364135	364135	you	8123	” at which each shuddered from head to foot , and said , “
364158	364244	364135	364135	you	8123	” and ran away . Either the consciousness of these enormities , or the reaction consequent on liquor , reduces Mr Perch to an extreme state of low spirits at that hour of the evening when he usually seeks consolation in the society of Mrs Perch at Balls Pond ; and Mrs Perch frets a good deal , for she fears his confidence in woman is shaken now , and that he half expects on coming home at night to find her gone off with some Viscount—“which
364246	364256	364271	364272	Mrs P.	582	” as she observes to an intimate female friend , “
364301	364331	364293	364293	I	0	” Mr Dombey ’s servants are becoming , at the same time , quite dissipated , and unfit for other service . They have hot suppers every night , and “
364335	364779	364293	364293	I	0	” with smoking drinks upon the board . Mr Towlinson is always maudlin after half - past ten , and frequently begs to know whether he did n’t say that no good would ever come of living in a corner house ? They whisper about Miss Florence , and wonder where she is ; but agree that if Mr Dombey do n’t know , Mrs Dombey does . This brings them to the latter , of whom Cook says , She had a stately way though , had n’t she ? But she was too high ! They all agree that she was too high , and Mr Towlinson ’s old flame , the housemaid ( who is very virtuous ) , entreats that you will never talk to her any more about people who hold their heads up , as if the ground was n’t good enough for ’em . Everything that is said and done about it , except by Mr Dombey , is done in chorus . Mr Dombey and the world are alone together . CHAPTER LII . Secret Intelligence Good Mrs Brown and her daughter Alice kept silent company together , in their own dwelling . It was early in the evening , and late in the spring . But a few days had elapsed since Mr Dombey had told Major Bagstock of his singular intelligence , singularly obtained , which might turn out to be valueless , and might turn out to be true ; and the world was not satisfied yet . The mother and daughter sat for a long time without interchanging a word : almost without motion . The old woman ’s face was shrewdly anxious and expectant ; that of her daughter was expectant too , but in a less sharp degree , and sometimes it darkened , as if with gathering disappointment and incredulity . The old woman , without heeding these changes in its expression , though her eyes were often turned towards it , sat mumbling and munching , and listening confidently . Their abode , though poor and miserable , was not so utterly wretched as in the days when only Good Mrs Brown inhabited it . Some few attempts at cleanliness and order were manifest , though made in a reckless , gipsy way , that might have connected them , at a glance , with the younger woman . The shades of evening thickened and deepened as the two kept silence , until the blackened walls were nearly lost in the prevailing gloom . Then Alice broke the silence which had lasted so long , and said : “
364794	364795	364796	364796	Death	232	” “
364801	364809	364796	364796	Death	232	” returned the old woman , impatiently . “
364815	364816	364810	364810	He	8127	” “
364821	364825	364817	364817	We	8130	” said Alice . “
364831	364836	364826	364826	We	8130	” returned her mother . “
364840	364845	364826	364826	We	8130	” said the daughter . “
364858	364864	364855	364855	I	0	” croaked the old woman . “
364940	364941	364921	364921	I	0	” “
364947	364959	364921	364921	I	0	” asked her daughter , roused to interest in a moment . “
364987	365022	365023	365023	I	0	” said the old woman , hobbling to the cupboard , and lighting a candle , which displayed the workings of her mouth to ugly advantage , as she brought it to the table . “
365041	365066	365023	365023	I	0	” It was something different from that , truly , as she sat as still as a crouched tigress , with her kindling eyes . “
365069	365077	365078	365078	I	0	” said the old woman , triumphantly . “
365122	365123	365118	365118	you	8135	” “
365132	365141	365130	365130	mother	12864	” replied Alice , in a low voice . “
365148	365198	365120	365120	him	8127	” As she drew herself within her shawl , and gathered it about her , the old woman complied ; and peering out , and beckoning , gave admission to Mr Dombey , who stopped when he had set his foot within the door , and looked distrustfully around . “
365212	365222	365223	365223	I	0	” said the old woman , curtseying and chattering . “
365236	365237	365223	365223	I	0	” “
365242	365252	365223	365223	I	0	” asked Mr Dombey , looking at her companion . “
365259	365265	365223	365223	I	0	” said the old woman . “
365279	365296	365273	365273	She	5929	” A shadow fell upon his face not less expressive than if he had groaned aloud , “
365305	365369	365370	365370	Woman	10967	” but he looked at her steadily , and she , without any acknowledgment of his presence , looked at him . The shadow on his face was darker when he turned his glance away from her ; and even then it wandered back again , furtively , as if he were haunted by her bold eyes , and some remembrance they inspired . “
365372	365415	365416	365416	Woman	614	” said Mr Dombey to the old witch who was chuckling and leering close at his elbow , and who , when he turned to address her , pointed stealthily at her daughter , and rubbed her hands , and pointed again , “
365488	365496	365459	365459	you	614	” with a disdainful glance about him , “
365516	365535	365511	365511	I	0	” he said , after a moment ’s pause , during which he had observed her , sternly , “
365589	365590	365592	365596	a proud , hard gentleman	8148	” “
365598	365614	365592	365596	a proud , hard gentleman	8148	” chuckled the old woman , shaking her head , and rubbing her shrivelled hands , “
365667	365668	365662	365662	you	614	” “
365671	365685	365662	365662	you	614	” returned Mr Dombey , apparently relieved , and assured by this inquiry , “
365739	365740	365724	365724	I	0	” “
365750	365764	365742	365742	you	0	” asked the younger woman , without rising , or altering her attitude . “
365772	365777	365742	365742	you	0	” said Mr Dombey . “
365793	365797	365778	365778	You	614	” she returned . “
365808	365809	365799	365799	you	0	” “
365818	365823	365810	365810	You	614	” said Mr Dombey . “
365827	365837	365810	365810	You	614	” she answered , without any show of emotion : “
365908	365924	365904	365906	the same man	8156	” He started , in spite of himself , and looked at her with astonishment . “
365927	365937	365904	365906	the same man	8156	” she said , with a kind of laugh . “
366100	366168	366085	366085	My	0	” The old woman , who had shown great uneasiness during this speech , which had a tendency to depreciate her expected gains , pulled Mr Dombey softly by the sleeve , and whispered to him not to mind her . He glared at them both , by turns , with a haggard look , and said , in a deeper voice than was usual with him : “
366177	366178	366174	366174	you	0	” “
366194	366200	366192	366192	someone	2832	” answered the old woman . “
366219	366220	366223	366223	you	0	” “
366226	366231	366223	366223	you	0	” said Mr Dombey . “
366234	366250	366223	366223	you	0	” she croaked , laying her hand , like a claw , upon his arm . “
366274	366285	366265	366265	he	1310	” said Good Mrs Brown , crooking her ten fingers , “
366294	366334	366286	366286	I	0	” Mr Dombey followed her with his eyes as she hobbled to the door , and looked out again : and then his glance sought her daughter ; but she remained impassive , silent , and regardless of him . “
366342	366364	366336	366336	you	0	” he said , when the bent figure of Mrs Brown came back , shaking its head and chattering to itself , “
366373	366374	366336	366336	you	0	” “
366377	366392	366336	366336	you	0	” said the old woman , looking up into his face , and nodding . “
366409	366410	366336	366336	you	0	” “
366413	366422	366423	366424	A stranger	9917	” said the old woman , nodding again . “
366426	366427	366423	366424	A stranger	9917	” “
366430	366441	366423	366424	A stranger	9917	” said the old woman , with a shrill laugh . “
366523	366592	366500	366500	Your	0	” Her sharp eye had detected an involuntary expression of this feeling on his part , which was not unreasonable under the circumstances . In satisfaction of it she now took the candle to the door she spoke of . Mr Dombey looked in ; assured himself that it was an empty , crazy room ; and signed to her to put the light back in its place . “
366596	366600	366500	366500	Your	0	” he asked , “
366606	366607	366500	366500	Your	0	” “
366611	366615	366500	366500	Your	0	” she answered . “
366627	366805	366617	366618	your worship	8149	” He made no answer ; but began pacing the room with an irresolute air , as if he were undecided whether to remain or depart , and as if he had some quarrel with himself for being there at all . But soon his tread grew slower and heavier , and his face more sternly thoughtful ; as the object with which he had come , fixed itself in his mind , and dilated there again . While he thus walked up and down with his eyes on the ground , Mrs Brown , in the chair from which she had risen to receive him , sat listening anew . The monotony of his step , or the uncertainty of age , made her so slow of hearing , that a footfall without had sounded in her daughter ’s ears for some moments , and she had looked up hastily to warn her mother of its approach , before the old woman was roused by it . But then she started from her seat , and whispering “
366810	366859	366807	366807	he	8172	” hurried her visitor to his place of observation , and put a bottle and glass upon the table , with such alacrity , as to be ready to fling her arms round the neck of Rob the Grinder on his appearance at the door . [ Illustration ] “
366867	366872	366863	366865	my bonny boy	8173	” cried Mrs Brown , “
366887	366888	366885	366885	Robby	424	” “
366894	366899	366891	366892	Misses Brown	285	” remonstrated the Grinder . “
366930	366931	366928	366928	you	285	” “
366940	366950	366951	366951	Me	0	” cried the old woman , apostrophizing the ceiling . “
366961	366962	366951	366951	Me	0	” “
366979	366988	366968	366968	I	0	” said the unfortunate youth , greatly aggravated ; “
367026	367051	367021	367021	I	0	” He looked and spoke as if he would have been far from objecting to do so , however , on a favourable occasion . “
367060	367065	367021	367021	I	0	” whimpered the Grinder . “
367086	367087	367079	367079	you	285	” “
367093	367102	367091	367091	dear	9979	” said the old woman with a grin . “
367105	367133	367091	367091	dear	9979	” replied the Grinder , lifting a large cage tied up in a wrapper , on the table , and untying it with his teeth and hands . “
367142	367143	367134	367134	It	8180	” “
367151	367152	367149	367149	Rob	424	” “
367162	367168	367154	367154	you	285	” returned the goaded Grinder . “
367181	367198	367177	367177	I	0	” said Rob , pulling his hair with both hands in the exasperation of his feelings , “
367211	367212	367200	367200	she	8180	” “
367223	367233	367216	367216	you	285	” cried the old woman , with ready vehemence . “
367242	367253	367237	367238	Misses Brown	588	” returned the Grinder , with tears in his eyes . “
367271	367272	367274	367274	you	285	” “
367285	367330	367280	367280	you	285	” With that , Mrs Brown held him in her fond embrace once more ; and did not release him until he had made several violent and ineffectual struggles with his legs , and his hair was standing on end all over his head . “
367333	367338	367397	367398	Misses Brown	588	” returned the Grinder , “
367368	367369	367362	367362	you	285	” “
367379	367393	367362	367362	you	285	” said the old woman , contemplating him with a look of reproach . “
367400	367405	367397	367398	Misses Brown	588	” returned the Grinder , “
367466	367485	367446	367446	I	0	” He rubbed it hard with his sleeve , as if to remove the tender polish in question . “
367497	367515	367495	367495	Robin	424	” said the old woman , filling the glass from the bottle and giving it to him . “
367521	367526	367518	367519	Misses Brown	588	” returned the Grinder . “
367540	367560	367535	367535	you	588	” Which , to judge from the expression of his face , did not include any very choice blessings . “
367567	367607	367535	367535	you	588	” said the Grinder , glancing at Alice , who sat with her eyes fixed , as it seemed to him , on the wall behind him , but in reality on Mr Dombey ’s face at the door , “
367618	367633	367535	367535	you	588	” He drained the glass to these two sentiments , and set it down . “
367642	367646	367636	367636	I	0	” he proceeded . “
367675	367676	367655	367655	You	588	” “
367679	367684	367655	367655	You	588	” repeated Mrs Brown . “
367690	367695	367687	367687	I	0	” returned the Grinder . “
367718	367719	367707	367707	You	588	” “
367726	367732	367724	367724	Robby	424	” suggested the old woman . “
367735	367740	367724	367724	Robby	424	” said the Grinder . “
367808	367817	367818	367818	I	0	” mused the Grinder with a dejected face , “
367828	367829	367818	367818	I	0	” “
367835	367841	367818	367818	I	0	” screamed the old woman . “
367851	367857	367843	367843	you	588	” returned the craven Rob . “
367884	367885	367886	367886	He	8192	” “
367906	367917	367893	367893	He	8192	” cried Mrs Brown , lifting up her skinny hands . “
367927	367928	367919	367919	I	0	” “
367942	367950	367939	367940	Mrs Brown	285	” said Rob , shaking his head . “
367974	367975	367966	367966	I	0	” “
367985	367992	367983	367983	Rob	424	” said Mrs Brown , quickly . “
367998	368002	367995	367996	Misses Brown	588	” repeated Rob . “
368012	368108	368114	368114	Robby	424	” Checking himself abruptly , and not without a fearful glance across the room , Rob filled the glass again , and having slowly emptied it , shook his head , and began to draw his fingers across and across the wires of the parrot ’s cage by way of a diversion from the dangerous theme that had just been broached . The old woman eyed him slily , and hitching her chair nearer his , and looking in at the parrot , who came down from the gilded dome at her call , said : “
368116	368117	368114	368114	Robby	424	” “
368125	368132	368122	368123	Misses Brown	588	” returned the Grinder , shortly . “
368140	368145	368138	368138	Rob	424	” said Mrs Brown . “
368149	368207	368146	368147	Pretty Polly	617	” said the Grinder . The old woman darted a glance at him that might have warned him to consider his ears in danger , but it was his turn to look in at the parrot now , and however expressive his imagination may have made her angry scowl , it was unseen by his bodily eyes . “
368220	368307	368308	368308	Robby	424	” said the old woman , in a wheedling voice , but with increased malignity of aspect . Rob was so absorbed in contemplation of the parrot , and in trolling his forefinger on the wires , that he made no answer . The old woman had her clutch within a hair ’s breadth of his shock of hair as it stooped over the table ; but she restrained her fingers , and said , in a voice that choked with its efforts to be coaxing : “
368313	368314	368308	368308	Robby	424	” “
368320	368325	368326	368326	I	0	” returned the Grinder . “
368340	368341	368330	368330	Master	8195	” “
368349	368404	368346	368347	Misses Brown	588	” returned the Grinder . Mrs Brown instantly directed the clutch of her right hand at his hair , and the clutch of her left hand at his throat , and held on to the object of her fond affection with such extraordinary fury , that his face began to blacken in a moment . “
368408	368413	368418	368418	you	588	” exclaimed the Grinder , “
368437	368536	368431	368432	Misses Brow	618	” The young woman , however , equally unmoved by his direct appeal to her , and by his inarticulate utterance , remained quite neutral , until , after struggling with his assailant into a corner , Rob disengaged himself , and stood there panting and fenced in by his own elbows , while the old woman , panting too , and stamping with rage and eagerness , appeared to be collecting her energies for another swoop upon him . At this crisis Alice interposed her voice , but not in the Grinder ’s favour , by saying , “
368547	368548	368551	368552	young woman	15908	” “
368554	368558	368551	368552	young woman	15908	” blubbered Rob ; “
368614	368631	368632	368632	I	0	” said the frightened and afflicted Grinder , with his coat - cuff at his eye . “
368644	368645	368640	368640	your	15908	” “
368650	368655	368640	368640	your	15908	” gasped Mrs Brown . “
368661	368662	368656	368656	You	15908	” “
368679	368685	368676	368677	Misses Brown	588	” retorted the fearful Rob . “
368697	368698	368686	368686	You	15908	” “
368712	368718	368708	368708	his	15908	” said the old woman . “
368766	368767	368768	368768	I	0	” “
368775	368781	368772	368773	Misses Brown	588	” returned the abject Grinder , “
368804	368805	368806	368806	I	0	” “
368813	368838	368806	368806	I	0	” said Mrs Brown , with an action of her crooked fingers that made him shrink into half his natural compass in the corner . “
368998	369048	369049	369050	Misses Brown	588	” The old woman , to the unspeakable dismay of the Grinder , walked her twisted figure round and round , in a ring of some four feet in diameter , constantly repeating these words , and shaking her fist above her head , and working her mouth about . “
369052	369064	369049	369050	Misses Brown	588	” pleaded Rob , coming a little out of his corner , “
369087	369088	369085	369085	you	588	” “
369095	369106	369085	369085	you	588	” said Mrs Brown , still wrathfully pursuing her circle . “
369117	369118	369119	369120	Misses Brown	588	” “
369122	369128	369119	369120	Misses Brown	588	” urged the tormented Grinder , “
369197	369203	369192	369192	I	0	” with a wretched face , “
369245	369257	369229	369229	you	588	” said the Grinder , appealing in desperation to the daughter . “
369268	369286	369265	369265	he	8207	” she interposed , in her stern voice , and with an impatient action of her head ; “
369314	369411	369415	369415	Master	6313	” Mrs Brown , moved as it seemed by this very tender exhortation , presently began to howl ; and softening by degrees , took the apologetic Grinder to her arms , who embraced her with a face of unutterable woe , and like a victim as he was , resumed his former seat , close by the side of his venerable friend , whom he suffered , not without much constrained sweetness of countenance , combating very expressive physiognomical revelations of an opposite character to draw his arm through hers , and keep it there . “
369420	369439	369415	369415	Master	6313	” said Mrs Brown , when , sitting in this amicable posture , they had pledged each other . “
369459	369463	369443	369443	you	8219	” Rob implored . “
369476	369477	369473	369473	I	0	” “
369487	369497	369485	369485	Robby	424	” said Mrs Brown , in a wheedling tone . “
369511	369515	369516	369516	I	0	” faltered Rob . “
369526	369527	369523	369524	Misses Brown	588	” “
369535	369536	369533	369533	Rob	424	” “
369555	369567	369551	369551	my	0	” said the Grinder , rolling them in a forlorn way . “
369573	369574	369571	369571	Rob	424	” “
369596	369621	369622	369622	Ye	588	” cried the Grinder , in a burst of despair . The impetuous Mrs Brown rising directly , the tortured Grinder detained her , stammering “
369641	369665	369637	369637	she	8220	” he added , in allusion to the daughter , whose eyes were fixed upon the face that now again looked out behind . “
369673	369688	369671	369671	lad	8221	” said the old woman , holding him closer to prevent his turning round . “
369711	369712	369703	369703	you	424	” “
369721	369732	369733	369734	What lady	8224	” cried the Grinder in a tone of piteous supplication . “
369736	369740	369741	369742	The lady	9737	” she retorted . “
369747	369748	369744	369745	Mrs Dombey	186	” “
369758	369762	369755	369755	her	9737	” replied Rob . “
369773	369792	369769	369769	Robby	424	” said the old woman in his ear , and taking note of every change in his face . “
369802	369803	369795	369795	I	0	” “
369820	369824	369817	369818	Misses Brown	588	” replied Rob , “
369840	369878	369880	369882	the old hag	8228	“ Where did they go that night , Rob ? Straight away ? How did they go ? Where did you see her ? Did she laugh ? Did she cry ? Tell me all about it , ”
369915	369961	369962	369964	The wretched Grinder	7253	“ Come ! Begin ! I want to be told all about it . What , Rob , boy ! You and me can keep a secret together , eh ? We ’ve done so before now . Where did they go first , Rob ? ”
369973	369978	369980	369982	the old woman	10432	“ Are you dumb ? ”
369986	370013	370015	370017	the bewildered Grinder	8231	“ Lord , Misses Brown , no ! You expect a cove to be a flash of lightning . I wish I was the electric fluency , ”
370019	370034	370015	370017	the bewildered Grinder	8231	“ I ’d have a shock at somebody , that would settle their business . ”
370035	370041	370043	370045	the old woman	10432	“ What do you say ? ”
370051	370063	370065	370067	the false Rob	424	“ I ’m wishing my love to you , Misses Brown , ”
370075	370093	370099	370101	the old woman	10432	“ Where did they go to first was it ? Him and her , do you mean ? ”
370094	370097	370099	370101	the old woman	10432	“ Ah ! ”
370105	370109	370099	370101	the old woman	10432	“ Them two . ”
370110	370125	370127	370127	Rob	424	“ Why , they did n’t go nowhere — not together , I mean , ”
370167	370175	370177	370179	the reluctant Grinder	7303	“ That was the art of it , ”
370181	370213	370177	370179	the reluctant Grinder	7303	“ that ’s the way nobody saw ’em go , or has been able to say how they did go . They went different ways , I tell you Misses Brown . ”
370214	370228	370230	370232	the old woman	10432	“ Ay , ay , ay ! To meet at an appointed place , ”
370246	370276	370278	370280	the unwilling Grinder	8237	“ Why , if they were n’t a going to meet somewhere , I suppose they might as well have stayed at home , might n’t they , Brown ? ”
370282	370289	370291	370293	the old woman	10432	“ Well , Rob ? Well ? ”
370319	370332	370334	370335	the Grinder	4568	“ What , have n’t we talked enough yet , Misses Brown ? ”
370389	370410	370369	370369	he	4568	“ Did she laugh that night , was it ? Did n’t you ask if she laughed , Misses Brown ? ”
370411	370415	370417	370419	the old woman	10432	“ Or cried ? ”
370424	370427	370429	370430	the Grinder	4568	“ Neither , ”
370432	370471	370429	370430	the Grinder	4568	“ She kept as steady when she and me — oh , I see you will have it out of me , Misses Brown ! But take your solemn oath now , that you ’ll never tell anybody . ”
370501	370518	370520	370521	the Grinder	4568	“ She kept as steady , then , when she and me went down to Southampton , ”
370523	370582	370520	370521	the Grinder	4568	“ as a image . In the morning she was just the same , Misses Brown . And when she went away in the packet before daylight , by herself — me pretending to be her servant , and seeing her safe aboard — she was just the same . Now , are you contented , Misses Brown ? ”
370583	370591	370593	370594	Mrs Brown	285	“ No , Rob . Not yet , ”
370598	370608	370610	370612	the unfortunate Rob	424	“ Oh , here ’s a woman for you ! ”
370625	370637	370610	370612	the unfortunate Rob	424	“ What did you wish to know next , Misses Brown ? ”
370638	370649	370650	370650	she	285	“ What became of Master ? Where did he go ? ”
370670	370683	370685	370685	Rob	424	“ Upon my soul , I do n’t know , Misses Brown , ”
370687	370819	370685	370685	Rob	424	“ Upon my soul I do n’t know what he did , nor where he went , nor anything about him I only know what he said to me as a caution to hold my tongue , when we parted ; and I tell you this , Misses Brown , as a friend , that sooner than ever repeat a word of what we ’re saying now , you had better take and shoot yourself , or shut yourself up in this house , and set it a - fire , for there ’s nothing he would n’t do , to be revenged upon you . You do n’t know him half as well as I do , Misses Brown . You ’re never safe from him , I tell you . ”
370820	370828	370830	370832	the old woman	10432	“ Have n’t I taken an oath , ”
370834	370842	370830	370832	the old woman	10432	“ and wo n’t I keep it ? ”
370843	370857	370859	370859	Rob	424	“ Well , I ’m sure I hope you will , Misses Brown , ”
370874	370886	370887	370887	He	424	“ For your own sake , quite as much as mine . ”
371016	371019	371020	371020	she	10432	“ Rob , ”
371029	371042	371020	371020	she	10432	“ Good gracious , Misses Brown , what ’s the matter now ? ”
371048	371061	371062	371062	Rob	424	“ Rob ! where did the lady and Master appoint to meet ? ”
371096	371105	371106	371108	The old woman	10432	“ How should I know , Misses Brown ? ”
371121	371144	371111	371111	her	10432	“ Come , lad ! It ’s no use leading me to that , and there leaving me . I want to know ”
371162	371183	371150	371150	Rob	424	“ How can I pronounce the names of foreign places , Mrs Brown ? What an unreasonable woman you are ! ”
371184	371194	371195	371195	she	10432	“ But you have heard it said , Robby , ”
371199	371210	371195	371195	she	10432	“ and you know what it sounded like . Come ! ”
371211	371221	371223	371224	the Grinder	4568	“ I never heard it said , Misses Brown , ”
371226	371229	371231	371233	the old woman	10432	“ Then , ”
371236	371249	371231	371233	the old woman	10432	“ you have seen it written , and you can spell it . ”
371342	371355	371357	371357	Rob	424	“ Now I tell you beforehand what it is , Misses Brown , ”
371359	371448	371357	371357	Rob	424	“ it ’s no use asking me anything else . I wo n’t answer anything else ; I ca n’t . How long it was to be before they met , or whose plan it was that they was to go away alone , I do n’t know no more than you do . I do n’t know any more about it . If I was to tell you how I found out this word , you ’d believe that . Shall I tell you , Misses Brown ? ”
371449	371454	371335	371335	her	10432	“ Yes , Rob . ”
371455	371476	371478	371478	Rob	424	“ Well then , Misses Brown . The way — now you wo n’t ask any more , you know ? ”
371496	371501	371503	371504	Mrs Brown	285	“ Not another word , ”
371506	371646	371503	371504	Mrs Brown	285	“ Well then , the way was this . When a certain person left the lady with me , he put a piece of paper with a direction written on it in the lady ’s hand , saying it was in case she should forget . She was n’t afraid of forgetting , for she tore it up as soon as his back was turned , and when I put up the carriage steps , I shook out one of the pieces — she sprinkled the rest out of the window , I suppose , for there was none there afterwards , though I looked for ’em . There was only one word on it , and that was this , if you must and will know . But remember ! You ’re upon your oath , Misses Brown ! ”
371675	371680	371681	371683	the old woman	10432	“ ‘ D , ’ ”
371694	371704	371705	371705	he	424	“ Will you hold your tongue , Misses Brown ? ”
371720	371735	371705	371705	he	424	“ I wo n’t have it read out . Be quiet , will you ! ”
371736	371743	371744	371744	she	10432	“ Then write large , Rob , ”
371752	371764	371744	371744	she	10432	“ for my eyes are not good , even at print . ”
371903	371906	371908	371909	the Grinder	4568	“ There ! ”
371959	371971	371972	371974	The old woman	10432	“ Now , I hope you ’re contented , Misses Brown ! ”
372249	372257	372227	372227	her	10432	“ What will he do , Ally ? ”
372258	372261	372263	372264	the daughter	11069	“ Mischief , ”
372266	372269	372271	372273	the old woman	10432	“ Murder ? ”
372275	372301	372271	372273	the old woman	10432	“ He ’s a madman , in his wounded pride , and may do that , for anything we can say , or he either . ”
373003	373016	373018	373019	Mr Perch	366	“ I ’ve stepped over from Balls Pond at a early hour , ”
373048	373093	373095	373096	Mr Perch	366	“ agreeable to my instructions last night . They was , to be sure and bring a note to you , Mr Carker , before you went out in the morning . I should have been here a good hour and a half ago , ”
373100	373131	373095	373096	Mr Perch	366	“ but for the state of health of Mrs P. , who I thought I should have lost in the night , I do assure you , five distinct times . ”
373132	373139	373141	373141	Harriet	445	“ Is your wife so ill ? ”
373143	373149	373151	373152	Mr Perch	366	“ Why , you see , ”
373163	373219	373151	373152	Mr Perch	366	“ she takes what has happened in our House so much to heart , Miss. Her nerves is so very delicate , you see , and soon unstrung . Not but what the strongest nerves had good need to be shook , I ’m sure . You feel it very much yourself , no doubts . ”
373231	373245	373246	373247	Mr Perch	366	“ I ’m sure I feel it myself , in my humble way , ”
373260	373310	373257	373257	his	366	“ in a manner I could n’t have believed if I had n’t been called upon to undergo . It has almost the effect of drink upon me . I literally feels every morning as if I had been taking more than was good for me over - night . ”
373380	373386	373388	373389	Mr Perch	366	“ Therefore I can judge , ”
373401	373419	373392	373392	his	366	“ of the feelings of such as is at all peculiarly sitiwated in this most painful rewelation . ”
373473	373484	373486	373487	Mr Perch	366	“ If I rightly recollect , there was no answer , ”
373494	373511	373486	373487	Mr Perch	366	“ but perhaps you ’ll be so good as cast your eye over it , Sir . ”
373538	373546	373526	373526	himself	366	“ No . No answer is expected . ”
373547	373558	373560	373560	Perch	366	“ Then I shall wish you good morning , Miss , ”
373602	373628	373644	373646	the Sunday ones	8307	” said Mr Perch , taking two steps back again , and comprehensively addressing both the brother and sister in a whisper of increased mystery , “
373711	373716	373708	373709	Another one	8311	” said Mr Perch , “
373771	373848	373757	373757	I	0	” Mr Perch resorted to his breast pocket , as if to produce the paragraph but receiving no encouragement , pulled out his beaver gloves , picked up his hat , and took his leave ; and before it was high noon , Mr Perch had related to several select audiences at the King ’s Arms and elsewhere , how Miss Carker , bursting into tears , had caught him by both hands , and said , “
373867	373881	373882	373882	Perch	366	” and how Mr John Carker had said , in an awful voice , “
373899	373900	373892	373892	him	366	” “
373904	373923	373901	373902	Dear John	622	” said Harriet , when they were left alone , and had remained silent for some few moments . “
373932	373933	373892	373892	him	366	” “
373940	373944	373945	373945	I	0	” he replied . “

374065	374088	374038	374038	his	533	” She looked as little shocked and as hopeful as she could , but it was distressing news , for many reasons . “
374097	374106	374038	374038	his	533	” said John Carker , reading the letter , “
374217	374218	374202	374202	Harriet	445	” “
374239	374244	374202	374202	Harriet	445	” she replied gently , “
374247	374248	374202	374202	Harriet	445	” “
374260	374265	374266	374266	He	274	” said John Carker . “

374351	374377	374334	374334	I	0	” He covered his face with both his hands ; but soon permitted her , coming near him , to take one in her own . “
374393	374398	374390	374390	I	0	” said his sister , “
374456	374479	374482	374483	dearest sister	8323	” A smile played on her lips , as she kissed his cheek , and entreated him to be of good cheer . “
374518	374519	374520	374520	John	444	” “
374522	374532	374520	374520	John	444	” she laid her hand hastily upon his lips , “
374544	374548	374520	374520	John	444	” He was silent “
374558	374565	374552	374552	me	0	” quietly sitting by his side , “
374633	374634	374642	374642	Harriet	445	” “
374644	374652	374661	374661	he	10173	” he answered with a sorrowful smile . “
374688	374689	374690	374690	Harriet	445	” “
374692	374698	374719	374719	he	10173	” exclaimed her wondering brother , “
374705	374706	374701	374702	this friend	8330	” “
374713	374717	374709	374709	I	0	” she returned . “

374841	374842	374839	374839	Harriet	445	” “
374849	374865	374839	374839	Harriet	445	” said his sister , with the slightest and most transient glow upon her cheek ; “
374931	374932	374904	374904	I	0	” “
374938	374939	374904	374904	I	0	” “
375103	375104	375089	375089	his	10173	” “
375107	375112	375089	375089	his	10173	” inquired her brother . “
375223	375224	375225	375225	Harriet	445	” “
375227	375239	375225	375225	Harriet	445	” said her brother , who had listened with close attention , “
375258	375488	375489	375489	Harriet	445	” His sister painted , as vividly as she could , the features , stature , and dress of her visitor ; but John Carker , either from having no knowledge of the original , or from some fault in her description , or from some abstraction of his thoughts as he walked to and fro , pondering , could not recognise the portrait she presented to him . However , it was agreed between them that he should see the original when he next appeared . This concluded , the sister applied herself , with a less anxious breast , to her domestic occupations ; and the grey - haired man , late Junior of Dombey ’s , devoted the first day of his unwonted liberty to working in the garden . It was quite late at night , and the brother was reading aloud while the sister plied her needle , when they were interrupted by a knocking at the door . In the atmosphere of vague anxiety and dread that lowered about them in connexion with their fugitive brother , this sound , unusual there , became almost alarming . The brother going to the door , the sister sat and listened timidly . Someone spoke to him , and he replied and seemed surprised ; and after a few words , the two approached together . “
375491	375509	375489	375489	Harriet	445	” said her brother , lighting in their late visitor , and speaking in a low voice , “
375524	375574	375575	375575	John	274	” His sister started back , as if a ghost had entered . In the doorway stood the unknown friend , with the dark hair sprinkled with grey , the ruddy face , the broad clear brow , and hazel eyes , whose secret she had kept so long ! “
375577	375585	375575	375575	John	274	” she said , half - breathless . “
375597	375598	375599	375600	The gentleman	2410	” “
375605	375621	375599	375600	The gentleman	2410	” said the visitor , coming in — for he had stopped a moment in the doorway—“is
375723	375768	375790	375791	Mr John	274	” By this time , he had greeted Harriet with that able mingling of cordiality and respect which she recollected so well , and had sat down near her , pulled off his gloves , and thrown them into his hat upon the table . “
375774	375778	375790	375791	Mr John	274	” he said , “
375847	375894	375814	375814	she	930	” Putting his hands into his pockets , and leaning back in his chair , he looked at the brother and sister as if it were interesting to him to see them together ; and went on to say , with a kind of irritable thoughtfulness : “
376167	376168	376169	376169	I	0	” “
376191	376196	376189	376189	Sir	735	” said John Carker . “
376209	376214	376206	376206	I	0	” returned the other , “
376307	376308	376309	376309	They	8357	” “
376331	376347	376327	376328	Mr Morfin	253	” said her brother , looking back to him for the resumption of his explanation . “
376377	376382	376384	376384	he	11470	” said Mr Morfin ; “
376482	376483	376466	376466	You	274	” “
376489	376498	376487	376487	Harriet	443	” said her brother in a low voice , “
376512	376513	376514	376514	Its	8370	” “
376563	376568	376557	376557	I	0	” said their visitor ; “
376675	376710	376652	376652	I	0	” He sat for a minute or so , drumming with one hand on the table ; and resumed in a hurry , as if he were anxious to get rid of his confession . “
376907	376908	376911	376911	I	0	” “
376916	376921	376911	376911	I	0	” said John Carker , “
376940	376941	376933	376933	Harriet	443	” “
376952	376957	376950	376950	John	274	” interposed the visitor , “
377167	377176	377234	377234	I	0	” said the visitor , dropping his voice , “
377184	377217	377241	377241	I	0	” He seemed conscious that these latter words had escaped him against his will , and stretching out a hand to the brother , and a hand to the sister , continued : “
377323	377332	377307	377307	You	0	” With these words he rose to go . “
377340	377345	377338	377338	John	274	” he said goodhumouredly , “
377363	377384	377335	377335	you	0	” John Carker ’s heart was full , and he would have relieved it in speech , if he could ; “
377416	377445	377446	377446	You	0	” Following him out with his eyes , he turned kindly to Harriet , and said in a lower voice , and with an altered and graver manner : “
377464	377465	377466	377466	I	0	” “
377471	377475	377466	377466	I	0	” said Harriet . “
377487	377492	377476	377476	You	0	” rejoined the visitor , “
377511	377512	377503	377503	he	8395	” “
377515	377516	377517	377517	He	8395	” “

377527	377531	377523	377523	I	0	” said Harriet . “
377538	377539	377523	377523	I	0	” “
377550	377555	377541	377541	he	8395	” said Mr Morfin ; “
377776	377777	377769	377769	you	8400	” “
377782	377794	377769	377769	you	8400	” she answered , with her frightened face fixed on his . “
377804	377805	377808	377808	he	8395	” “
377917	377918	377923	377923	you	8395	” “
377930	377934	377923	377923	you	8395	” said Harriet . “
377943	377944	377923	377923	you	8395	” “
377948	377957	377923	377923	you	8395	” he returned , with a little hesitation . “
377965	377966	377967	377967	I	0	” “
377980	377994	377995	377995	You	0	” said Mr Morfin , after a moment ’s survey of her face . “
378002	378003	378007	378007	I	0	” “
378099	378100	378049	378049	his	15781	” “
378109	378113	378049	378049	his	15781	” said Harriet . “
378122	378130	378049	378049	his	15781	” he replied , shaking her hand , “
378194	378759	378761	378761	me	0	” With that he kissed her hand , and , passing out to the door where her brother stood awaiting his coming , put him cheerfully aside when he essayed to speak ; told him that , as they would see each other soon and often , he might speak at another time , if he would , but there was no leisure for it then ; and went away at a round pace , in order that no word of gratitude might follow him . The brother and sister sat conversing by the fireside , until it was almost day ; made sleepless by this glimpse of the new world that opened before them , and feeling like two people shipwrecked long ago , upon a solitary coast , to whom a ship had come at last , when they were old in resignation , and had lost all thought of any other home . But another and different kind of disquietude kept them waking too . The darkness out of which this light had broken on them gathered around ; and the shadow of their guilty brother was in the house where his foot had never trod . Nor was it to be driven out , nor did it fade before the sun . Next morning it was there ; at noon ; at night Darkest and most distinct at night , as is now to be told . John Carker had gone out , in pursuance of a letter of appointment from their friend , and Harriet was left in the house alone . She had been alone some hours . A dull , grave evening , and a deepening twilight , were not favourable to the removal of the oppression on her spirits . The idea of this brother , long unseen and unknown , flitted about her in frightful shapes . He was dead , dying , calling to her , staring at her , frowning on her . The pictures in her mind were so obtrusive and exact that , as the twilight deepened , she dreaded to raise her head and look at the dark corners of the room , lest his wraith , the offspring of her excited imagination , should be waiting there , to startle her . Once she had such a fancy of his being in the next room , hiding — though she knew quite well what a distempered fancy it was , and had no belief in it — that she forced herself to go there , for her own conviction . But in vain . The room resumed its shadowy terrors , the moment she left it ; and she had no more power to divest herself of these vague impressions of dread , than if they had been stone giants , rooted in the solid earth . It was almost dark , and she was sitting near the window , with her head upon her hand , looking down , when , sensible of a sudden increase in the gloom of the apartment , she raised her eyes , and uttered an involuntary cry . Close to the glass , a pale scared face gazed in ; vacantly , for an instant , as searching for an object ; then the eyes rested on herself , and lighted up . “
378775	378835	378768	378768	I	0	” and the hand rattled on the glass . She recognised immediately the woman with the long dark hair , to whom she had given warmth , food , and shelter , one wet night . Naturally afraid of her , remembering her violent behaviour , Harriet , retreating a little from the window , stood undecided and alarmed . “
378865	378921	378860	378860	me	0	” The vehement manner of the entreaty , the earnest expression of the face , the trembling of the two hands that were raised imploringly , a certain dread and terror in the voice akin to her own condition at the moment , prevailed with Harriet . She hastened to the door and opened it . “
378933	378943	378929	378929	I	0	” said the woman , catching at her hand . “
378960	378961	378955	378955	you	0	” “
379012	379043	379073	379073	You	0	” Her energy again prevailed , and they passed into the firelight of the little kitchen , where she had before sat , and ate , and dried her clothes . “
379047	379056	379073	379073	You	0	” said Alice , kneeling down beside her , “
379066	379067	379068	379068	I	0	” “

379161	379167	379158	379158	you	0	” said Harriet , gently , “

379178	379189	379158	379158	you	0	” returned the other , with a proud , fierce look “
379219	379276	379199	379199	you	0	” Still upon her knees , and with her eyes upon the fire , and the fire shining on her ruined beauty and her wild black hair , one long tress of which she pulled over her shoulder , and wound about her hand , and thoughtfully bit and tore while speaking , she went on : “
379287	379296	379199	379199	you	0	” plucking contemptuously at the hair she held , “
379417	379460	379466	379466	I	0	” Looking at the fire , as if she were forgetful , for the moment , of having any auditor , she continued in a dreamy way , as she wound the long tress of hair tight round and round her hand . “
379500	379521	379498	379498	me	0	” Raising her eyes swiftly from their moody gaze upon the fire , to Harriet ’s face , she said : “
379589	379590	379586	379586	you	8426	” “
379597	379601	379593	379593	you	8426	” said Harriet . “
379607	379616	379617	379617	His	8427	” rejoined Alice , with an eager look . “
379835	379836	379832	379832	you	8426	” “
379843	379847	379839	379839	you	8426	” repeated Harriet . “
379853	379870	379850	379850	you	8426	” said Alice , laying her hand upon her arm , and looking in her face , “
379886	379908	379884	379884	James	368	” Harriet trembled more and more , but did not avert her eyes from the eager look that rested on them . “
379986	379987	379979	379979	I	0	” “
380000	380001	379996	379996	you	8426	” “
380005	380025	379996	379996	you	8426	” said Alice , with the same grasp of her arm , and the same look in her face , “

380099	380103	380085	380085	I	0	” repeated Harriet . “

380266	380281	380261	380261	I	0	” pursued the other , with her eager look , regardless of the interruption . “

380566	380575	380563	380563	I	0	” cried Harriet , shuddering at these words . “
380614	380615	380604	380604	you	0	” “
380618	380619	380604	380604	you	0	” “
380740	381425	380699	380699	them	8450	” The fire ceased to be reflected in her jet black hair , uplifted face , and eager eyes ; her hand was gone from Harriet ’s arm ; and the place where she had been was empty . CHAPTER LIV . The Fugitives Tea - time , an hour short of midnight ; the place , a French apartment , comprising some half - dozen rooms;—a dull cold hall or corridor , a dining - room , a drawing - room , a bed - room , and an inner drawingroom , or boudoir , smaller and more retired than the rest . All these shut in by one large pair of doors on the main staircase , but each room provided with two or three pairs of doors of its own , establishing several means of communication with the remaining portion of the apartment , or with certain small passages within the wall , leading , as is not unusual in such houses , to some back stairs with an obscure outlet below . The whole situated on the first floor of so large an Hotel , that it did not absorb one entire row of windows upon one side of the square court - yard in the centre , upon which the whole four sides of the mansion looked . An air of splendour , sufficiently faded to be melancholy , and sufficiently dazzling to clog and embarrass the details of life with a show of state , reigned in these rooms . The walls and ceilings were gilded and painted ; the floors were waxed and polished ; crimson drapery hung in festoons from window , door , and mirror ; and candelabra , gnarled and intertwisted like the branches of trees , or horns of animals , stuck out from the panels of the wall . But in the day - time , when the lattice - blinds ( now closely shut ) were opened , and the light let in , traces were discernible among this finery , of wear and tear and dust , of sun and damp and smoke , and lengthened intervals of want of use and habitation , when such shows and toys of life seem sensitive like life , and waste as men shut up in prison do . Even night , and clusters of burning candles , could not wholly efface them , though the general glitter threw them in the shade . The glitter of bright tapers , and their reflection in looking - glasses , scraps of gilding and gay colours , were confined , on this night , to one room — that smaller room within the rest , just now enumerated . Seen from the hall , where a lamp was feebly burning , through the dark perspective of open doors , it looked as shining and precious as a gem . In the heart of its radiance sat a beautiful woman — Edith . She was alone . The same defiant , scornful woman still . The cheek a little worn , the eye a little larger in appearance , and more lustrous , but the haughty bearing just the same . No shame upon her brow ; no late repentance bending her disdainful neck . Imperious and stately yet , and yet regardless of herself and of all else , she sat with her dark eyes cast down , waiting for someone . No book , no work , no occupation of any kind but her own thought , beguiled the tardy time . Some purpose , strong enough to fill up any pause , possessed her . With her lips pressed together , and quivering if for a moment she released them from her control ; with her nostril inflated ; her hands clasped in one another ; and her purpose swelling in her breast ; she sat , and waited . At the sound of a key in the outer door , and a footstep in the hall , she started up , and cried “
381430	381452	380699	380699	them	8450	” The answer was in French , and two men came in with jingling trays , to make preparation for supper . “
381461	381465	381466	381466	Monsieur	8456	” she asked . “
381509	381510	381503	381503	Madame	624	” “
381513	381514	381503	381503	Madame	624	” “
381532	381546	381550	381550	Monsieur	8460	” a bald man , with a large beard from a neighbouring restaurant ; “
381613	381773	381774	381774	She	8463	” Edith said no more , but looked on thoughtfully while they prepared the table for two persons , and set the wine upon it . She arose before they had finished , and taking a lamp , passed into the bed - chamber and into the drawing - room , where she hurriedly but narrowly examined all the doors ; particularly one in the former room that opened on the passage in the wall . From this she took the key , and put it on the outer side . She then came back . The men — the second of whom was a dark , bilious subject , in a jacket , close shaved , and with a black head of hair close cropped — had completed their preparation of the table , and were standing looking at it . He who had spoken before , inquired whether Madame thought it would be long before Monsieur arrived ? “
381784	381785	381774	381774	She	8463	” “
381856	381917	381854	381854	him	8467	” In effect , Monsieur , admitted by the other of the two , came , with his gleaming teeth , through the dark rooms , like a mouth ; and arriving in that sanctuary of light and colour , a figure at full length , embraced Madame , and addressed her in the French tongue as his charming wife . “
381933	381989	381927	381927	Madame	624	” The bald man with the beard observed it , and cried out . Madame had only shrunk and shivered . Before the words were spoken , she was standing with her hand upon the velvet back of a great chair ; her figure drawn up to its full height , and her face immoveable . “
382034	382120	382186	382186	Madame	624	” These facts the bald man notified with bows and smiles , and presently the supper came . The hot dishes were on a chafing - dish ; the cold already set forth , with the change of service on a sideboard . Monsieur was satisfied with this arrangement . The supper table being small , it pleased him very well . Let them set the chafing - dish upon the floor , and go . He would remove the dishes with his own hands . “
382123	382131	382186	382186	Madame	624	” said the bald man , politely . “
382136	382151	382186	382186	Madame	624	” Monsieur was of another opinion . He required no further attendance that night . “
382155	382161	382162	382162	Madame	624	” the bald man hinted . “
382164	382168	382170	382170	her	624	” replied Monsieur , “
382178	382179	382188	382189	no maid	8473	” “
382191	382192	382186	382186	Madame	624	” “
382198	382201	382186	382186	Madame	624	” said Edith “
382426	382438	382439	382439	he	8477	“ How strange to come here by yourself , my love ! ”
382445	382448	382449	382449	she	481	“ What ? ”
382501	382505	382506	382506	he	8477	“ I say , ”
382523	382588	382506	382506	he	8477	“ how strange to come here alone ! It was unnecessary caution surely , and might have defeated itself . You were to have engaged an attendant at Havre or Rouen , and have had abundance of time for the purpose , though you had been the most capricious and difficult ( as you are the most beautiful , my love ) of women . ”
382616	382621	382623	382623	Carker	368	“ I have never , ”
382625	382666	382623	382623	Carker	368	“ seen you look so handsome , as you do tonight . Even the picture I have carried in my mind during this cruel probation , and which I have contemplated night and day , is exceeded by the reality . ”
382689	382697	382699	382699	Carker	368	“ Hard , unrelenting terms they were ! ”
382705	382755	382699	382699	Carker	368	“ but they are all fulfilled and passed , and make the present more delicious and more safe . Sicily shall be the place of our retreat . In the idlest and easiest part of the world , my soul , we ’ll both seek compensation for old slavery . ”
382784	382788	382789	382789	she	481	“ Stand still ! ”
382792	382799	382789	382789	she	481	“ or I shall murder you ! ”
382833	382837	382838	382838	she	481	“ Stand still ! ”
382841	382851	382838	382838	she	481	“ come no nearer me , upon your life ! ”
382877	382909	382869	382869	he	8477	“ Come , come ! Tush , we are alone , and out of everybody ’s sight and hearing . Do you think to frighten me with these tricks of virtue ? ”
382910	382918	382919	382919	she	481	“ Do you think to frighten me , ”
382923	383005	382919	382919	she	481	“ from any purpose that I have , and any course I am resolved upon , by reminding me of the solitude of this place , and there being no help near ? Me , who am here alone , designedly ? If I feared you , should I not have avoided you ? If I feared you , should I be here , in the dead of night , telling you to your face what I am going to tell ? ”
383006	383012	383013	383013	he	8485	“ And what is that , ”
383016	383033	383013	383013	he	8485	“ you handsome shrew ? Handsomer so , than any other woman in her best humour ? ”
383034	383040	383041	383041	she	8486	“ I tell you nothing , ”
383086	383087	383089	383089	you	8486	” “
383096	383195	383089	383089	you	8486	” he retorted , with a grin . Disdaining to reply , she stretched her arm out , pointing to the chair . He bit his lip , frowned , laughed , and sat down in it , with a baffled , irresolute , impatient air , he was unable to conceal ; and biting his nail nervously , and looking at her sideways , with bitter discomfiture , even while he feigned to be amused by her caprice . She put the knife down upon the table , and touching her bosom with her hand , said : “
383246	383300	383236	383236	I	0	” He affected to laugh jestingly , and entreated her to act her play out quickly , for the supper was growing cold . But the secret look with which he regarded her , was more sullen and lowering , and he struck his foot once upon the floor with a muttered oath . “
383305	383316	383318	383318	your	882	” said Edith , bending her darkest glance upon him , “
383408	383409	383410	383410	I	0	” “
383417	383421	383415	383415	Ma’am	219	” he replied , “
383453	383454	383439	383439	Edith	481	” “
383459	383485	383439	383439	Edith	481	” she said , surveying him with a haughty contempt and disgust , that he shrunk under , let him brave it as he would , “
383521	383522	383502	383502	his	8491	” “
383535	383542	383528	383528	you	219	” he asked her , tauntingly . “
383583	383612	383613	383613	I	0	” He turned upon her with his ugliest look , and gripped the table with his hand ; but neither rose , nor otherwise answered or threatened her . “
383618	383626	383615	383616	a woman	1577	” she said , confronting him steadfastly , “
383789	383790	383777	383777	you	8502	” “
383797	383801	383793	383793	I	0	” he said . “
383807	383811	383793	383793	I	0	” she rejoined , “
383887	383888	383883	383883	You	8502	” “
383891	383899	383883	383883	You	8502	” he said , showing all his teeth “
383904	383905	383900	383900	I	0	” “
383911	383917	383900	383900	I	0	” she rejoined once more , “
384104	384144	384101	384102	the man	9864	” He watched her closely , as she stood before him in the very triumph of her indignant beauty . She was resolute , he saw ; undauntable ; with no more fear of him than of a worm . “
384157	384162	384147	384147	I	0	” she went on . “
384250	384258	384231	384231	you	0	” He answered with a faint laugh , “
384267	384268	384264	384265	my queen	8510	” “
384295	384299	384284	384284	you	0	” she said , “
384303	384311	384284	384284	you	0	” He shrugged his shoulders , and laughed “
384315	384319	384320	384320	Your	8510	” she said . “
384326	384330	384320	384320	Your	8510	” he said , “
384341	384342	384343	384343	I	0	” “
384346	384350	384343	384343	I	0	” she said . “
384472	384473	384469	384469	your	0	” “
384478	384484	384469	384469	your	0	” he interrupted , smiling . “
384489	384490	384469	384469	your	0	” “
384495	384499	384469	384469	your	0	” said Edith , “
384587	384636	384584	384584	I	0	” He sprung up from his chair with a great oath . She put her hand into her bosom , and not a finger trembled , not a hair upon her head was stirred . He stood still : she too : the table and chair between them . “
384664	384672	384674	384674	I	0	” said Edith , pointing at him ; “
384807	384833	384844	384844	You	16316	” Her flashing eyes , uplifted for a moment , lighted again on Carker , and she held some letters out in her left hand . “
384837	384843	384844	384844	You	16316	” she said , contemptuously . “
384876	384906	384907	384907	We	8519	” She crunched them in her hand , and tossed them to his feet . And as she looked upon him now , a smile was on her face . “
384913	384917	384907	384907	We	8519	” she said . “
384961	384962	384963	384963	Edith	481	” “
384965	384975	384963	384963	Edith	481	” he retorted , menacing her with his hand . “
384989	384990	384991	384991	Their	8521	” “
384996	385012	385026	385026	they	8521	” she replied , uprearing her proud form as if she would have crushed him ; “
385070	385108	385057	385057	your	16316	” He stood before her , muttering and menacing , and scowling round as if for something that would help him to conquer her ; but with the same indomitable spirit she opposed him , without faltering . “
385115	385119	385120	385120	I	0	” she said , “
385213	385263	385211	385211	yourself	16316	” The foam was on his lips ; the wet stood on his forehead . If she would have faltered once for only one half - moment , he would have pinioned her ; but she was as firm as rock , and her searching eyes never left him . “
385270	385274	385264	385264	We	8527	” he said . “
385291	385292	385294	385294	you	0	” “
385297	385301	385294	385294	you	0	” she answered , “
385309	385310	385311	385311	I	0	” “
385318	385329	385311	385311	I	0	” he said with a ferocious gesture of his head . “
385344	385348	385311	385311	I	0	” she replied . “
385352	385356	385311	385311	I	0	” he said , “
385381	385389	385390	385390	We	8529	” and his teeth fairly shone again . “
385412	385413	385390	385390	We	8529	” “
385417	385429	385390	385390	We	8529	” she cried , with eyes that seemed to sparkle fire . “
385547	385698	385699	385699	Lastly	631	” He would have sold his soul to root her , in her beauty , to the floor , and make her arms drop at her sides , and have her at his mercy . But he could not look at her , and not be afraid of her . He saw a strength within her that was resistless . He saw that she was desperate , and that her unquenchable hatred of him would stop at nothing . His eyes followed the hand that was put with such rugged uncongenial purpose into her white bosom , and he thought that if it struck at him , and failed , it would strike there , just as soon . He did not venture , therefore , to advance towards her ; but the door by which he had entered was behind him , and he stepped back to lock it . “
385709	385717	385707	385707	yourself	8533	” she said , and smiled again . “
385765	385766	385767	385767	Strumpet	632	” “
385773	385811	385767	385767	Strumpet	632	” cried Carker . At the moment , the bell rang loudly in the hall . He turned white , as she held her hand up like an enchantress , at whose invocation the sound had come . “
385819	387075	385815	385815	you	8533	” He set his back against the door ; for he saw a change in her , and fancied she was coming on to pass him . But , in a moment , she was gone through the opposite doors communicating with the bed - chamber , and they shut upon her . Once turned , once changed in her inflexible unyielding look , he felt that he could cope with her . He thought a sudden terror , occasioned by this night - alarm , had subdued her ; not the less readily , for her overwrought condition . Throwing open the doors , he followed , almost instantly . But the room was dark ; and as she made no answer to his call , he was fain to go back for the lamp . He held it up , and looked round , everywhere , expecting to see her crouching in some corner ; but the room was empty . So , into the drawing - room and dining - room he went , in succession , with the uncertain steps of a man in a strange place ; looking fearfully about , and prying behind screens and couches ; but she was not there . No , nor in the hall , which was so bare that he could see that , at a glance . All this time , the ringing at the bell was constantly renewed , and those without were beating at the door . He put his lamp down at a distance , and going near it , listened . There were several voices talking together : at least two of them in English ; and though the door was thick , and there was great confusion , he knew one of these too well to doubt whose voice it was . He took up his lamp again , and came back quickly through all the rooms , stopping as he quitted each , and looking round for her , with the light raised above his head . He was standing thus in the bed - chamber , when the door , leading to the little passage in the wall , caught his eye . He went to it , and found it fastened on the other side ; but she had dropped a veil in going through , and shut it in the door . All this time the people on the stairs were ringing at the bell , and knocking with their hands and feet . He was not a coward : but these sounds ; what had gone before ; the strangeness of the place , which had confused him , even in his return from the hall ; the frustration of his schemes ( for , strange to say , he would have been much bolder , if they had succeeded ) ; the unseasonable time ; the recollection of having no one near to whom he could appeal for any friendly office ; above all , the sudden sense , which made even his heart beat like lead , that the man whose confidence he had outraged , and whom he had so treacherously deceived , was there to recognise and challenge him with his mask plucked off his face ; struck a panic through him . He tried the door in which the veil was shut , but could n’t force it . He opened one of the windows , and looked down through the lattice of the blind , into the court - yard ; but it was a high leap , and the stones were pitiless . The ringing and knocking still continuing — his panic too — he went back to the door in the bed - chamber , and with some new efforts , each more stubborn than the last , wrenched it open . Seeing the little staircase not far off , and feeling the night - air coming up , he stole back for his hat and coat , made the door as secure after him as he could , crept down lamp in hand , extinguished it on seeing the street , and having put it in a corner , went out where the stars were shining . CHAPTER LV . Rob the Grinder loses his Place The Porter at the iron gate which shut the court - yard from the street , had left the little wicket of his house open , and was gone away ; no doubt to mingle in the distant noise at the door of the great staircase . Lifting the latch softly , Carker crept out , and shutting the jangling gate after him with as little noise as possible , hurried off . In the fever of his mortification and unavailing rage , the panic that had seized upon him mastered him completely . It rose to such a height that he would have blindly encountered almost any risk , rather than meet the man of whom , two hours ago , he had been utterly regardless . His fierce arrival , which he had never expected ; the sound of his voice ; their having been so near a meeting , face to face ; he would have braved out this , after the first momentary shock of alarm , and would have put as bold a front upon his guilt as any villain . But the springing of his mine upon himself , seemed to have rent and shivered all his hardihood and self - reliance . Spurned like any reptile ; entrapped and mocked ; turned upon , and trodden down by the proud woman whose mind he had slowly poisoned , as he thought , until she had sunk into the mere creature of his pleasure ; undeceived in his deceit , and with his fox ’s hide stripped off , he sneaked away , abashed , degraded , and afraid . Some other terror came upon him quite removed from this of being pursued , suddenly , like an electric shock , as he was creeping through the streets Some visionary terror , unintelligible and inexplicable , associated with a trembling of the ground,—a rush and sweep of something through the air , like Death upon the wing . He shrunk , as if to let the thing go by . It was not gone , it never had been there , yet what a startling horror it had left behind . He raised his wicked face so full of trouble , to the night sky , where the stars , so full of peace , were shining on him as they had been when he first stole out into the air ; and stopped to think what he should do . The dread of being hunted in a strange remote place , where the laws might not protect him — the novelty of the feeling that it was strange and remote , originating in his being left alone so suddenly amid the ruins of his plans — his greater dread of seeking refuge now , in Italy or in Sicily , where men might be hired to assassinate him , he thought , at any dark street corner — the waywardness of guilt and fear — perhaps some sympathy of action with the turning back of all his schemes — impelled him to turn back too , and go to England . “
387091	387095	387086	387086	I	0	” he thought , “
387167	387575	387154	387154	I	0	” He muttered Edith ’s name , and clenched his hand . As he crept along , in the shadow of the massive buildings , he set his teeth , and muttered dreadful imprecations on her head , and looked from side to side , as if in search of her . Thus , he stole on to the gate of an inn - yard . The people were a - bed ; but his ringing at the bell soon produced a man with a lantern , in company with whom he was presently in a dim coach - house , bargaining for the hire of an old phaeton , to Paris . The bargain was a short one ; and the horses were soon sent for . Leaving word that the carriage was to follow him when they came , he stole away again , beyond the town , past the old ramparts , out on the open road , which seemed to glide away along the dark plain , like a stream . Whither did it flow ? What was the end of it ? As he paused , with some such suggestion within him , looking over the gloomy flat where the slender trees marked out the way , again that flight of Death came rushing up , again went on , impetuous and resistless , again was nothing but a horror in his mind , dark as the scene and undefined as its remotest verge . There was no wind ; there was no passing shadow on the deep shade of the night ; there was no noise . The city lay behind him , lighted here and there , and starry worlds were hidden by the masonry of spire and roof that hardly made out any shapes against the sky . Dark and lonely distance lay around him everywhere , and the clocks were faintly striking two . He went forward for what appeared a long time , and a long way ; often stopping to listen . At last the ringing of horses ’ bells greeted his anxious ears . Now softer , and now louder , now inaudible , now ringing very slowly over bad ground , now brisk and merry , it came on ; until with a loud shouting and lashing , a shadowy postillion muffled to the eyes , checked his four struggling horses at his side . “
387582	387583	387580	387580	Monsieur	8542	” “
387586	387587	387580	387580	Monsieur	8542	” “
387599	387600	387588	387588	Monsieur	8543	” “
387621	387622	387604	387604	Everyone	2674	” “

387687	388043	387683	387683	Halloa	249	” Away , at a gallop , over the black landscape , scattering the dust and dirt like spray ! The clatter and commotion echoed to the hurry and discordance of the fugitive ’s ideas . Nothing clear without , and nothing clear within . Objects flitting past , merging into one another , dimly descried , confusedly lost sight of , gone ! Beyond the changing scraps of fence and cottage immediately upon the road , a lowering waste . Beyond the shifting images that rose up in his mind and vanished as they showed themselves , a black expanse of dread and rage and baffled villainy . Occasionally , a sigh of mountain air came from the distant Jura , fading along the plain . Sometimes that rush which was so furious and horrible , again came sweeping through his fancy , passed away , and left a chill upon his blood . The lamps , gleaming on the medley of horses ’ heads , jumbled with the shadowy driver , and the fluttering of his cloak , made a thousand indistinct shapes , answering to his thoughts . Shadows of familiar people , stooping at their desks and books , in their remembered attitudes ; strange apparitions of the man whom he was flying from , or of Edith ; repetitions in the ringing bells and rolling wheels , of words that had been spoken ; confusions of time and place , making last night a month ago , a month ago last night — home now distant beyond hope , now instantly accessible ; commotion , discord , hurry , darkness , and confusion in his mind , and all around him.—Hallo ! Hi ! away at a gallop over the black landscape ; dust and dirt flying like spray , the smoking horses snorting and plunging as if each of them were ridden by a demon , away in a frantic triumph on the dark road — whither ? [ Illustration ] Again the nameless shock comes speeding up , and as it passes , the bells ring in his ears “
388046	388053	387683	387683	Halloa	249	” The wheels roar in his ears “
388056	388515	387683	387683	Halloa	249	” All the noise and rattle shapes itself into that cry . The lights and shadows dance upon the horses ’ heads like imps . No stopping now : no slackening ! On , on ! Away with him upon the dark road wildly ! He could not think to any purpose . He could not separate one subject of reflection from another , sufficiently to dwell upon it , by itself , for a minute at a time . The crash of his project for the gaining of a voluptuous compensation for past restraint ; the overthrow of his treachery to one who had been true and generous to him , but whose least proud word and look he had treasured up , at interest , for years — for false and subtle men will always secretly despise and dislike the object upon which they fawn and always resent the payment and receipt of homage that they know to be worthless ; these were the themes uppermost in his mind . A lurking rage against the woman who had so entrapped him and avenged herself was always there ; crude and misshapen schemes of retaliation upon her , floated in his brain ; but nothing was distinct . A hurry and contradiction pervaded all his thoughts . Even while he was so busy with this fevered , ineffectual thinking , his one constant idea was , that he would postpone reflection until some indefinite time . Then , the old days before the second marriage rose up in his remembrance . He thought how jealous he had been of the boy , how jealous he had been of the girl , how artfully he had kept intruders at a distance , and drawn a circle round his dupe that none but himself should cross ; and then he thought , had he done all this to be flying now , like a scared thief , from only the poor dupe ? He could have laid hands upon himself for his cowardice , but it was the very shadow of his defeat , and could not be separated from it . To have his confidence in his own knavery so shattered at a blow — to be within his own knowledge such a miserable tool — was like being paralysed . With an impotent ferocity he raged at Edith , and hated Mr Dombey and hated himself , but still he fled , and could do nothing else . Again and again he listened for the sound of wheels behind . Again and again his fancy heard it , coming on louder and louder . At last he was so persuaded of this , that he cried out , “
388517	388548	388549	388550	The devil	9849	” preferring even the loss of ground to such uncertainty . The word soon brought carriage , horses , driver , all in a heap together , across the road . “
388552	388562	387683	387683	Halloa	249	” cried the driver , looking over his shoulder , “
388568	388569	387683	387683	Halloa	249	” “
388576	388577	387683	387683	Halloa	249	” “
388580	388581	387683	387683	Halloa	249	” “
388585	388586	387683	387683	Halloa	249	” “
388596	388604	388593	388594	cursed brigand	8549	” to a horse who shook his bells “
388608	388609	388593	388594	cursed brigand	8549	” “
388627	388628	388629	388632	Miscreant with a Pig	8551	” “
388639	388659	388593	388594	cursed brigand	8549	” to another horse , who bit another , who frightened the other two , who plunged and backed . “
388665	388666	388593	388594	cursed brigand	8549	” “
388669	388670	388593	388594	cursed brigand	8549	” “
388679	388680	388593	388594	cursed brigand	8549	” “
388698	388747	388748	388748	Hallo	633	” The entangled equipage , half hidden in the reeking cloud from the horses , goes on slowly at first , for the driver , checked unnecessarily in his progress , sulkily takes out a pocket - knife , and puts a new lash to his whip . Then “
388756	390810	388748	388748	Hallo	633	” Away once more , savagely . And now the stars faded , and the day glimmered , and standing in the carriage , looking back , he could discern the track by which he had come , and see that there was no traveller within view , on all the heavy expanse . And soon it was broad day , and the sun began to shine on cornfields and vineyards ; and solitary labourers , risen from little temporary huts by heaps of stones upon the road , were , here and there , at work repairing the highway , or eating bread . By and by , there were peasants going to their daily labour , or to market , or lounging at the doors of poor cottages , gazing idly at him as he passed . And then there was a postyard , ankle - deep in mud , with steaming dunghills and vast outhouses half ruined ; and looking on this dainty prospect , an immense , old , shadeless , glaring , stone chateau , with half its windows blinded , and green damp crawling lazily over it , from the balustraded terrace to the taper tips of the extinguishers upon the turrets . Gathered up moodily in a corner of the carriage , and only intent on going fast — except when he stood up , for a mile together , and looked back ; which he would do whenever there was a piece of open country — he went on , still postponing thought indefinitely , and still always tormented with thinking to no purpose . Shame , disappointment , and discomfiture gnawed at his heart ; a constant apprehension of being overtaken , or met — for he was groundlessly afraid even of travellers , who came towards him by the way he was going — oppressed him heavily . The same intolerable awe and dread that had come upon him in the night , returned unweakened in the day . The monotonous ringing of the bells and tramping of the horses ; the monotony of his anxiety , and useless rage ; the monotonous wheel of fear , regret , and passion , he kept turning round and round ; made the journey like a vision , in which nothing was quite real but his own torment . It was a vision of long roads , that stretched away to an horizon , always receding and never gained ; of ill - paved towns , up hill and down , where faces came to dark doors and ill - glazed windows , and where rows of mudbespattered cows and oxen were tied up for sale in the long narrow streets , butting and lowing , and receiving blows on their blunt heads from bludgeons that might have beaten them in ; of bridges , crosses , churches , postyards , new horses being put in against their wills , and the horses of the last stage reeking , panting , and laying their drooping heads together dolefully at stable doors ; of little cemeteries with black crosses settled sideways in the graves , and withered wreaths upon them dropping away ; again of long , long roads , dragging themselves out , up hill and down , to the treacherous horizon . Of morning , noon , and sunset ; night , and the rising of an early moon . Of long roads temporarily left behind , and a rough pavement reached ; of battering and clattering over it , and looking up , among house - roofs , at a great church - tower ; of getting out and eating hastily , and drinking draughts of wine that had no cheering influence ; of coming forth afoot , among a host of beggars — blind men with quivering eyelids , led by old women holding candles to their faces ; idiot girls ; the lame , the epileptic , and the palsied — of passing through the clamour , and looking from his seat at the upturned countenances and outstretched hands , with a hurried dread of recognising some pursuer pressing forward — of galloping away again , upon the long , long road , gathered up , dull and stunned , in his corner , or rising to see where the moon shone faintly on a patch of the same endless road miles away , or looking back to see who followed . Of never sleeping , but sometimes dozing with unclosed eyes , and springing up with a start , and a reply aloud to an imaginary voice . Of cursing himself for being there , for having fled , for having let her go , for not having confronted and defied him . Of having a deadly quarrel with the whole world , but chiefly with himself . Of blighting everything with his black mood as he was carried on and away . It was a fevered vision of things past and present all confounded together ; of his life and journey blended into one . Of being madly hurried somewhere , whither he must go . Of old scenes starting up among the novelties through which he travelled . Of musing and brooding over what was past and distant , and seeming to take no notice of the actual objects he encountered , but with a wearisome exhausting consciousness of being bewildered by them , and having their images all crowded in his hot brain after they were gone . A vision of change upon change , and still the same monotony of bells and wheels , and horses ’ feet , and no rest . Of town and country , postyards , horses , drivers , hill and valley , light and darkness , road and pavement , height and hollow , wet weather and dry , and still the same monotony of bells and wheels , and horses ’ feet , and no rest . A vision of tending on at last , towards the distant capital , by busier roads , and sweeping round , by old cathedrals , and dashing through small towns and villages , less thinly scattered on the road than formerly , and sitting shrouded in his corner , with his cloak up to his face , as people passing by looked at him . Of rolling on and on , always postponing thought , and always racked with thinking ; of being unable to reckon up the hours he had been upon the road , or to comprehend the points of time and place in his journey . Of being parched and giddy , and half mad . Of pressing on , in spite of all , as if he could not stop , and coming into Paris , where the turbid river held its swift course undisturbed , between two brawling streams of life and motion . A troubled vision , then , of bridges , quays , interminable streets ; of wine - shops , water - carriers , great crowds of people , soldiers , coaches , military drums , arcades . Of the monotony of bells and wheels and horses ’ feet being at length lost in the universal din and uproar . Of the gradual subsidence of that noise as he passed out in another carriage by a different barrier from that by which he had entered . Of the restoration , as he travelled on towards the seacoast , of the monotony of bells and wheels , and horses ’ feet , and no rest . Of sunset once again , and nightfall . Of long roads again , and dead of night , and feeble lights in windows by the roadside ; and still the old monotony of bells and wheels , and horses ’ feet , and no rest . Of dawn , and daybreak , and the rising of the sun . Of tolling slowly up a hill , and feeling on its top the fresh sea - breeze ; and seeing the morning light upon the edges of the distant waves . Of coming down into a harbour when the tide was at its full , and seeing fishing - boats float on , and glad women and children waiting for them . Of nets and seamen ’s clothes spread out to dry upon the shore ; of busy sailors , and their voices high among ships ’ masts and rigging ; of the buoyancy and brightness of the water , and the universal sparkling . Of receding from the coast , and looking back upon it from the deck when it was a haze upon the water , with here and there a little opening of bright land where the Sun struck . Of the swell , and flash , and murmur of the calm sea . Of another grey line on the ocean , on the vessel ’s track , fast growing clearer and higher . Of cliffs and buildings , and a windmill , and a church , becoming more and more visible upon it . Of steaming on at last into smooth water , and mooring to a pier whence groups of people looked down , greeting friends on board . Of disembarking , passing among them quickly , shunning every one ; and of being at last again in England . He had thought , in his dream , of going down into a remote country - place he knew , and lying quiet there , while he secretly informed himself of what transpired , and determined how to act , Still in the same stunned condition , he remembered a certain station on the railway , where he would have to branch off to his place of destination , and where there was a quiet Inn . Here , he indistinctly resolved to tarry and rest . With this purpose he slunk into a railway carriage as quickly as he could , and lying there wrapped in his cloak as if he were asleep , was soon borne far away from the sea , and deep into the inland green . Arrived at his destination he looked out , and surveyed it carefully . He was not mistaken in his impression of the place . It was a retired spot , on the borders of a little wood . Only one house , newly - built or altered for the purpose , stood there , surrounded by its neat garden ; the small town that was nearest , was some miles away . Here he alighted then ; and going straight into the tavern , unobserved by anyone , secured two rooms upstairs communicating with each other , and sufficiently retired . His object was to rest , and recover the command of himself , and the balance of his mind . Imbecile discomfiture and rage — so that , as he walked about his room , he ground his teeth — had complete possession of him . His thoughts , not to be stopped or directed , still wandered where they would , and dragged him after them . He was stupefied , and he was wearied to death . But , as if there were a curse upon him that he should never rest again , his drowsy senses would not lose their consciousness . He had no more influence with them , in this regard , than if they had been another man ’s . It was not that they forced him to take note of present sounds and objects , but that they would not be diverted from the whole hurried vision of his journey . It was constantly before him all at once . She stood there , with her dark disdainful eyes again upon him ; and he was riding on nevertheless , through town and country , light and darkness , wet weather and dry , over road and pavement , hill and valley , height and hollow , jaded and scared by the monotony of bells and wheels , and horses ’ feet , and no rest . “
390816	390831	388748	388748	Hallo	633	” he asked of the waiter , who was making preparations for his dinner . “
390836	390837	390834	390834	Sir	735	” “

391910	391915	391916	391916	he	735	“ At what time , ”
391935	391945	391916	391916	he	735	“ do I leave here , did you say ? ”
391946	391966	391967	391967	He	735	“ About a quarter after four , Sir . Express comes through at four , Sir.—It do n’t stop . ”
391988	391998	392000	392001	the man	9864	“ Nobody going with you , Sir , probably , ”
392003	392020	392000	392001	the man	9864	“ Two gentlemen here , Sir , but they ’re waiting for the train to London . ”
392021	392031	392033	392033	Carker	533	“ I thought you said there was nobody here , ”
392053	392080	392033	392033	Carker	533	“ Not then , sir . Two gentlemen came in the night by the short train that stops here , Sir . Warm water , Sir ? ”
392081	392097	392100	392100	himself	9864	“ No ; and take away the candle . There ’s day enough for me . ”
392778	392788	392790	392791	the Nipper	4308	“ Oh my own pretty darling sweet Miss Floy ! ”
392799	392876	392790	392791	the Nipper	4308	“ to think that it should come to this and I should find you here my own dear dove with nobody to wait upon you and no home to call your own but never never will I go away again Miss Floy for though I may not gather moss I ’m not a rolling stone nor is my heart a stone or else it would n’t bust as it is busting now oh dear oh dear ! ”
392908	392912	392914	392914	Susan	241	“ Oh love ! ”
392916	392939	392914	392914	Susan	241	“ I know all that ’s past I know it all my tender pet and I ’m a choking give me air ! ”
392940	392947	392949	392949	Florence	197	“ Susan , dear good Susan ! ”
392951	392981	392983	392983	Susan	241	“ Oh bless her ! I that was her little maid when she was a little child ! and is she really , really truly going to be married ? ”
393006	393012	393014	393014	Florence	197	“ Who told you so ? ”
393016	393026	393028	393028	Susan	241	“ Oh gracious me ! that innocentest creetur Toots , ”
393031	393060	393062	393062	Susan	241	“ I knew he must be right my dear , because he took on so . He ’s the devotedest and innocentest infant ! And is my darling , ”
393073	393081	393062	393062	Susan	241	“ really really going to be married ! ”
393161	393166	393172	393172	Florence	197	“ There , there ! ”
393175	393185	393172	393172	Florence	197	“ Now you ’re quite yourself , dear Susan ! ”
393247	393263	393265	393265	Susan	241	“ I - I - I never did see such a creetur as that Toots , ”
393267	393275	393265	393265	Susan	241	“ in all my born days never ! ”
393276	393280	393282	393282	Florence	197	“ So kind , ”
393284	393289	393290	393290	Susan	241	“ And so comic ! ”
393293	393312	393290	393290	Susan	241	“ The way he ’s been going on inside with me with that disrespectable Chicken on the box ! ”
393313	393319	393321	393321	Florence	197	“ About what , Susan ? ”
393325	393347	393349	393349	Susan	241	“ Oh about Lieutenant Walters , and Captain Gills , and you my dear Miss Floy , and the silent tomb , ”
393351	393356	393358	393358	Florence	197	“ The silent tomb ! ”
393360	393364	393358	393358	Florence	197	“ He says , ”
393374	393422	393366	393366	Susan	241	“ that he ’ll go down into it now immediately and quite comfortable , but bless your heart my dear Miss Floy he wo n’t , he ’s a great deal too happy in seeing other people happy for that , he may not be a Solomon , ”
393432	393454	393428	393428	her	4308	“ nor do I say he is but this I do say a less selfish human creature human nature never knew ! ”
393547	393551	393553	393554	Mr Toots	504	“ Miss Dombey , ”
393556	393595	393553	393554	Mr Toots	504	“ To be again permitted to — to — gaze — at least , not to gaze , but — I do n’t exactly know what I was going to say , but it ’s of no consequence . ”
393596	393605	393607	393607	Florence	197	“ I have to thank you so often , ”
393625	393642	393617	393617	her	197	“ that I have no words left , and do n’t know how to do it . ”
393643	393647	393649	393650	Mr Toots	504	“ Miss Dombey , ”
393657	393708	393710	393711	Mr Toots	504	“ if it was possible that you could , consistently with your angelic nature , Curse me , you would — if I may be allowed to say so — floor me infinitely less , than by these undeserved expressions of kindness Their effect upon me — is — but , ”
393715	393728	393710	393711	Mr Toots	504	“ this is a digression , and of no consequence at all . ”
393752	393757	393759	393760	Mr Toots	504	“ I could wish , ”
393762	393866	393759	393760	Mr Toots	504	“ to take this opportunity , Miss Dombey , if I might , of entering into a word of explanation . I should have had the pleasure of — of returning with Susan at an earlier period ; but , in the first place , we did n’t know the name of the relation to whose house she had gone , and , in the second , as she had left that relation ’s and gone to another at a distance , I think that scarcely anything short of the sagacity of the Chicken , would have found her out in the time . ”
393873	393878	393880	393881	Mr Toots	504	“ This , however , ”
393883	394250	393880	393881	Mr Toots	504	“ is not the point . The company of Susan has been , I assure you , Miss Dombey , a consolation and satisfaction to me , in my state of mind , more easily conceived than described . The journey has been its own reward . That , however , still , is not the point . Miss Dombey , I have before observed that I know I am not what is considered a quick person . I am perfectly aware of that . I do n’t think anybody could be better acquainted with his own — if it was not too strong an expression , I should say with the thickness of his own head — than myself . But , Miss Dombey , I do , notwithstanding , perceive the state of — of things — with Lieutenant Walters . Whatever agony that state of things may have caused me ( which is of no consequence at all ) , I am bound to say , that Lieutenant Walters is a person who appears to be worthy of the blessing that has fallen on his — on his brow . May he wear it long , and appreciate it , as a very different , and very unworthy individual , that it is of no consequence to name , would have done ! That , however , still , is not the point . Miss Dombey , Captain Gills is a friend of mine ; and during the interval that is now elapsing , I believe it would afford Captain Gills pleasure to see me occasionally coming backwards and forwards here . It would afford me pleasure so to come . But I can not forget that I once committed myself , fatally , at the corner of the Square at Brighton ; and if my presence will be , in the least degree , unpleasant to you , I only ask you to name it to me now , and assure you that I shall perfectly understand you . I shall not consider it at all unkind , and shall only be too delighted and happy to be honoured with your confidence . ”
394251	394255	394257	394257	Florence	197	“ Mr Toots , ”
394259	394306	394257	394257	Florence	197	“ if you , who are so old and true a friend of mine , were to stay away from this house now , you would make me very unhappy . It can never , never , give me any feeling but pleasure to see you . “
394310	394322	394307	394308	Miss Dombey	287	” said Mr Toots , taking out his pocket - handkerchief , “
394379	394392	394393	394393	I	0	” Florence received this intimation with the prettiest expression of perplexity possible . “

394530	394540	394527	394527	I	0	” said Mr Toots , in an impassioned tone , “
394571	394613	394614	394615	Captain Gills	527	” Appearing not to get it , after waiting a minute or two to see if it would come , Mr Toots took a hasty leave , and went below to seek the Captain , whom he found in the shop . “
394617	394622	394646	394647	Captain Gills	527	” said Mr Toots , “
394662	394663	394657	394658	Miss Dombey	287	” “
394673	394678	394657	394658	Miss Dombey	287	” murmured the Captain . “
394685	394707	394682	394683	Captain Gills	527	” said Mr Toots , whose fervour of acquiescence was greatly heightened by his entire ignorance of the Captain ’s meaning . “
394726	394727	394723	394724	Lieutenant Walters	606	” “
394739	394762	394764	394765	Captain Cuttle	603	here,—Wal”r and sweet — heart will be jined together in the house of bondage , as soon as the askings is over , ”
394771	394778	394764	394765	Captain Cuttle	603	“ The askings , Captain Gills ! ”
394783	394791	394793	394794	the Captain	10100	“ In the church , down yonder , ”
394803	394808	394797	394797	his	10100	“ Oh ! Yes ! ”
394813	394817	394819	394820	the Captain	10100	“ And then , ”
394852	394877	394838	394838	his	10100	“ what follers ? That there pretty creetur , as delicately brought up as a foreign bird , goes away upon the roaring main with Wal”r
394884	394885	394886	394886	Lord	8637	” “
394891	394896	394888	394889	Captain Gills	527	” said Mr Toots . “
394899	394904	394886	394886	Lord	8637	” nodded the Captain . “
394935	394998	395000	395001	the Captain	10100	Wal”r made the woyage , and got into favour , aboard and ashore — being as smart and good a lad as ever stepped — and so , the supercargo dying at Canton , he got made ( having acted as clerk afore ) , and now he ’s supercargo aboard another ship , same owners . And so , you see , ”
395005	395016	395000	395001	the Captain	10100	“ the pretty creetur goes away upon the roaring main with Wal”r
395024	395036	395000	395001	the Captain	10100	” Mr Toots and Captain Cuttle heaved a sigh in concert . “
395040	395045	395046	395046	She	8642	” said the Captain . “
395145	395205	395134	395134	I	0	Wal”r was her true love , brother , and she his , I ’d have these here blue arms and legs chopped off , afore I ’d let her go . But I know it , and what then ! Why , then , I say , Heaven go with ’em both , and so it will ! Amen ! ”
395206	395210	395212	395213	Mr Toots	504	“ Captain Gills , ”
395215	395268	395212	395213	Mr Toots	504	“ let me have the pleasure of shaking hands . You ’ve a way of saying things , that gives me an agreeable warmth , all up my back . _ I _ say Amen . You are aware , Captain Gills , that I , too , have adored Miss Dombey . ”
395269	395273	395275	395276	the Captain	10100	“ Cheer up ! ”
395287	395293	395279	395279	his	10100	“ Stand by , boy ! ”
395294	395303	395305	395308	the spirited Mr Toots	504	“ It is my intention , Captain Gills , ”
395310	395389	395305	395308	the spirited Mr Toots	504	“ to cheer up . Also to standby , as much as possible . When the silent tomb shall yawn , Captain Gills , I shall be ready for burial ; not before . But not being certain , just at present , of my power over myself , what I wish to say to you , and what I shall take it as a particular favour if you will mention to Lieutenant Walters , is as follows . ”
395390	395395	395397	395398	the Captain	10100	“ Is as follers , ”
395400	395403	395397	395398	the Captain	10100	“ Steady ! ”
395404	395412	395414	395415	Mr Toots	504	“ Miss Dombey being so inexpressably kind , ”
395420	395453	395455	395456	Mr Toots	504	“ as to say that my presence is the reverse of disagreeable to her , and you and everybody here being no less forbearing and tolerant towards one who — who certainly , ”
395462	395646	395455	395456	Mr Toots	504	“ would appear to have been born by mistake , I shall come backwards and forwards of an evening , during the short time we can all be together . But what I ask is this . If , at any moment , I find that I can not endure the contemplation of Lieutenant Walters ’s bliss , and should rush out , I hope , Captain Gills , that you and he will both consider it as my misfortune and not my fault , or the want of inward conflict . That you ’ll feel convinced I bear no malice to any living creature - least of all to Lieutenant Walters himself — and that you ’ll casually remark that I have gone out for a walk , or probably to see what o’clock it is by the Royal Exchange . Captain Gills , if you could enter into this arrangement , and could answer for Lieutenant Walters , it would be a relief to my feelings that I should think cheap at the sacrifice of a considerable portion of my property . ”
395647	395651	395653	395654	the Captain	10100	“ My lad , ”
395656	395683	395653	395654	the Captain	10100	“ say no more . There ai n’t a colour you can run up , as wo n’t be made out , and answered to , by Wal”r
395687	395688	395653	395654	the Captain	10100	” “
395692	395697	395689	395690	Captain Gills	527	” said Mr Toots , “
395736	395741	395733	395733	You	527	” said Mr Toots , “
395775	396105	395749	395749	Co.	262	” With this apposite illustration , of which he seemed a little Proud , Mr Toots gave Captain Cuttle his blessing and departed . The honest Captain , with his Heart ’s Delight in the house , and Susan tending her , was a beaming and a happy man . As the days flew by , he grew more beaming and more happy , every day . After some conferences with Susan ( for whose wisdom the Captain had a profound respect , and whose valiant precipitation of herself on Mrs MacStinger he could never forget ) , he proposed to Florence that the daughter of the elderly lady who usually sat under the blue umbrella in Leadenhall Market , should , for prudential reasons and considerations of privacy , be superseded in the temporary discharge of the household duties , by someone who was not unknown to them , and in whom they could safely confide . Susan , being present , then named , in furtherance of a suggestion she had previously offered to the Captain , Mrs Richards . Florence brightened at the name . And Susan , setting off that very afternoon to the Toodle domicile , to sound Mrs Richards , returned in triumph the same evening , accompanied by the identical rosy - cheeked apple - faced Polly , whose demonstrations , when brought into Florence ’s presence , were hardly less affectionate than those of Susan Nipper herself . This piece of generalship accomplished ; from which the Captain derived uncommon satisfaction , as he did , indeed , from everything else that was done , whatever it happened to be ; Florence had next to prepare Susan for their approaching separation . This was a much more difficult task , as Miss Nipper was of a resolute disposition , and had fully made up her mind that she had come back never to be parted from her old mistress any more . “
396113	396117	396118	396118	you	197	” she said , “
396231	396232	396233	396234	Dear Susan	579	” “
396246	396247	396236	396236	I	0	” “
396278	396285	396276	396276	God	239	” said the impetuous Susan Nipper . “
396332	396333	396317	396317	I	0	” “
396338	396352	396317	396317	I	0	” cried Susan , bursting out afresh , and shaking her head violently , “
396408	396409	396404	396404	I	0	” “
396414	396418	396412	396412	Susan	241	” returned Florence . “
396428	396448	396422	396422	Walter	293	” Ah , what a bright , amazed , enraptured smile was on her face!—He should have seen it . “
396464	396469	396459	396459	I	0	” she added tenderly ; “
396477	396480	396475	396475	dear	9979	” Susan sobbed “
396487	396488	396484	396485	Miss Floy	197	” “
396491	396495	396496	396496	I	0	” said Florence , “
396570	396713	396562	396562	Susan	241	” Miss Nipper was so much affected by the quiet fervour of these words , and the simple , heartfelt , all - pervading earnestness expressed in them , and making the speaker ’s face more beautiful and pure than ever , that she could only cling to her again , crying . Was her little mistress really , really going to be married , and pitying , caressing , and protecting her , as she had done before . But the Nipper , though susceptible of womanly weaknesses , was almost as capable of putting constraint upon herself as of attacking the redoubtable MacStinger . From that time , she never returned to the subject , but was always cheerful , active , bustling , and hopeful . She did , indeed , inform Mr Toots privately , that she was only “
396716	397436	397439	397439	dear	9979	” for the time , and that when it was all over , and Miss Dombey was gone , she might be expected to become a spectacle distressful ; and Mr Toots did also express that it was his case too , and that they would mingle their tears together ; but she never otherwise indulged her private feelings in the presence of Florence or within the precincts of the Midshipman . Limited and plain as Florence ’s wardrobe was — what a contrast to that prepared for the last marriage in which she had taken part!—there was a good deal to do in getting it ready , and Susan Nipper worked away at her side , all day , with the concentrated zeal of fifty sempstresses . The wonderful contributions Captain Cuttle would have made to this branch of the outfit , if he had been permitted — as pink parasols , tinted silk stockings , blue shoes , and other articles no less necessary on shipboard — would occupy some space in the recital . He was induced , however , by various fraudulent representations , to limit his contributions to a work - box and dressing case , of each of which he purchased the very largest specimen that could be got for money . For ten days or a fortnight afterwards , he generally sat , during the greater part of the day , gazing at these boxes ; divided between extreme admiration of them , and dejected misgivings that they were not gorgeous enough , and frequently diving out into the street to purchase some wild article that he deemed necessary to their completeness . But his master - stroke was , the bearing of them both off , suddenly , one morning , and getting the two words FLORENCE GAY engraved upon a brass heart inlaid over the lid of each . After this , he smoked four pipes successively in the little parlour by himself , and was discovered chuckling , at the expiration of as many hours . Walter was busy and away all day , but came there every morning early to see Florence , and always passed the evening with her . Florence never left her high rooms but to steal downstairs to wait for him when it was his time to come , or , sheltered by his proud , encircling arm , to bear him company to the door again , and sometimes peep into the street . In the twilight they were always together . Oh blessed time ! Oh wandering heart at rest ! Oh deep , exhaustless , mighty well of love , in which so much was sunk ! The cruel mark was on her bosom yet . It rose against her father with the breath she drew , it lay between her and her lover when he pressed her to his heart . But she forgot it . In the beating of that heart for her , and in the beating of her own for him , all harsher music was unheard , all stern unloving hearts forgotten . Fragile and delicate she was , but with a might of love within her that could , and did , create a world to fly to , and to rest in , out of his one image . How often did the great house , and the old days , come before her in the twilight time , when she was sheltered by the arm , so proud , so fond , and , creeping closer to him , shrunk within it at the recollection ! How often , from remembering the night when she went down to that room and met the never - to - be forgotten look , did she raise her eyes to those that watched her with such loving earnestness , and weep with happiness in such a refuge ! The more she clung to it , the more the dear dead child was in her thoughts : but as if the last time she had seen her father , had been when he was sleeping and she kissed his face , she always left him so , and never , in her fancy , passed that hour . “
397441	397454	397437	397437	Walter	293	” said Florence , one evening , when it was almost dark . “
397465	397466	397459	397459	I	0	” “
397488	397489	397485	397486	sweet Florence	196	” “

397569	397614	397537	397537	You	293	“ In money , dear . All these preparations that Susan and I are so busy with — I have been able to purchase very little for myself . You were poor before . But how much poorer I shall make you , Walter ! ”
397615	397623	397624	397624	Florence	196	“ And how much richer , Florence ! ”
397632	397635	397637	397637	Walter	293	“ Besides , ”
397639	397666	397637	397637	Walter	293	“ long ago — before I went to sea — I had a little purse presented to me , dearest , which had money in it . ”
397667	397670	397672	397672	Florence	196	“ Ah ! ”
397677	397693	397672	397672	Florence	196	“ very little ! very little , Walter ! But , you must not think , ”
397711	397750	397696	397696	she	196	“ that I regret to be this burden on you . No , dear love , I am glad of it . I am happy in it . I would n’t have it otherwise for all the world ! ”
397751	397760	397698	397698	her	196	“ Nor I , indeed , dear Florence . ”
397761	397858	397696	397696	she	196	“ Ay ! but , Walter , you can never feel it as I do . I am so proud of you ! It makes my heart swell with such delight to know that those who speak of you must say you married a poor disowned girl , who had taken shelter here ; who had no other home , no other friends ; who had nothing — nothing ! Oh , Walter , if I could have brought you millions , I never could have been so happy for your sake , as I am ! ”
397859	397870	397871	397871	he	8667	“ And you , dear Florence ? are you nothing ? ”
397874	397886	397871	397871	he	8667	“ No , nothing , Walter . Nothing but your wife . ”
397903	397942	397696	397696	she	196	“ I am nothing any more , that is not you . I have no earthly hope any more , that is not you . I have nothing dear to me any more , that is not you . ”
398019	398071	398016	398016	Walter	293	“ Florence , love , the lading of our ship is nearly finished , and probably on the very day of our marriage she will drop down the river . Shall we go away that morning , and stay in Kent until we go on board at Gravesend within a week ? ”
398072	398087	398016	398016	Walter	293	“ If you please , Walter . I shall be happy anywhere . But — ”
398088	398094	398016	398016	Walter	293	“ Yes , my life ? ”
398095	398099	398101	398101	Florence	196	“ You know , ”
398103	398153	398101	398101	Florence	196	“ that we shall have no marriage party , and that nobody will distinguish us by our dress from other people . As we leave the same day , will you — will you take me somewhere that morning , Walter — early — before we go to church ? ”
398658	398662	398641	398641	he	10100	“ Stand by ! ”
398668	398675	398641	398641	he	10100	“ Ed’ard Cuttle , my lad , ”
398736	398739	398741	398742	Mr Toots	504	“ Susan , ”
398744	398792	398794	398795	Mr Toots	504	“ I am drawn towards the building . The words which cut me off from Miss Dombey for ever , will strike upon my ears like a knell you know , but upon my word and honour , I feel that I must hear them . Therefore , ”
398797	398811	398794	398795	Mr Toots	504	“ will you accompany me to - morrow , to the sacred edifice ? ”
398841	398844	398846	398847	Mr Toots	504	“ Susan , ”
398853	398937	398939	398940	Mr Toots	504	“ before my whiskers began to be observed by anybody but myself , I adored Miss Dombey . While yet a victim to the thraldom of Blimber , I adored Miss Dombey . When I could no longer be kept out of my property , in a legal point of view , and — and accordingly came into it — I adored Miss Dombey . The banns which consign her to Lieutenant Walters , and me to — to Gloom , you know , ”
398949	399014	398939	398940	Mr Toots	504	“ may be dreadful , will be dreadful ; but I feel that I should wish to hear them spoken . I feel that I should wish to know that the ground was certainly cut from under me , and that I had n’t a hope to cherish , or a — or a leg , in short , to — to go upon . ”
400335	400340	400342	400343	the Captain	10100	“ Steady , steady ! ”
400347	400367	400342	400343	the Captain	10100	“ what ’s amiss with you ? You do n’t seem easy in your mind tonight , my boy ! ”
400405	400413	400415	400416	the Captain	10100	“ It ’s my opinion , Di , ”
400432	400473	400415	400416	the Captain	10100	“ as you have your doubts of Mrs Richards ; but if you ’re the animal I take you to be , you ’ll think better o ’ that ; for her looks is her commission . Now , Brother : ”
400478	400490	400415	400416	the Captain	10100	“ if so be as you ’re ready , heave ahead . ”
400588	400593	400569	400569	himself	10100	“ Sol Gills ahoy ! ”
400689	400697	400681	400681	he	504	“ Hooroar , my lad , hooroar ! ”
400718	400729	400700	400701	Mr Toots	504	“ Certainly , Captain Gills , whatever you think proper ! ”
400891	400898	400900	400902	the radiant Captain	8759	“ Chock full o ’ science , ”
400904	400934	400900	400902	the radiant Captain	8759	“ as ever he was ! Sol Gills , Sol Gills , what have you been up to , for this many a long day , my ould boy ? ”
400935	400943	400945	400947	the old man	1205	“ I ’m half blind , Ned , ”
400949	400958	400945	400947	the old man	1205	“ and almost deaf and dumb with joy . ”
400959	400964	400966	400967	the Captain	10100	“ His wery woice , ”
400982	401037	400945	400947	the old man	1205	justice—“his wery woice as chock full o ’ science as ever it was ! Sol Gills , lay to , my lad , upon your own wines and fig - trees like a taut ould patriark as you are , and overhaul them there adwentures o ’ yourn , in your own formilior woice . “
401042	401057	401039	401040	the woice	8762	” said the Captain , impressively , and announcing a quotation with his hook , “
401090	401141	401067	401067	you	10100	” The Captain sat down with the air of a man who had happily expressed the feeling of everybody present , and immediately rose again to present Mr Toots , who was much disconcerted by the arrival of anybody , appearing to prefer a claim to the name of Gills . “
401144	401149	401150	401150	I	0	” stammered Mr Toots , “
401168	401169	401162	401162	you	0	” “
401178	401188	401162	401162	you	0	” suggested the Captain , in a low voice . “
401195	401200	401192	401193	Captain Gills	527	” assented Mr Toots . “
401216	401232	401213	401214	Mr Sols	639	” said Toots , hitting on that name in the inspiration of a bright idea , “
401259	401264	401256	401256	I	0	” said Mr Toots , “
401275	401324	401266	401266	you	0	” With these courteous words , Mr Toots sat down blushing and chuckling . The old Instrument - maker , seated in a corner between Walter and Florence , and nodding at Polly , who was looking on , all smiles and delight , answered the Captain thus : “
401366	401385	401387	401387	him	392	” said the old man , breaking off , and rubbing his hands in his old dreamy way . “
401389	401395	401387	401387	him	392	” cried the Captain gravely . “
401407	401413	401414	401414	you	392	” aside to Mr Toots , “
401424	401425	401426	401426	I	0	” “
401438	401443	401435	401436	Captain Gills	527	” said Mr Toots . “
401458	401484	401456	401456	her	8767	” resumed the Instrument - maker , taking his old spectacles from his pocket , and putting them on his forehead in his old manner , “
401507	401521	401522	401522	I	0	the,”—glancing at the downcast eyes of Florence , and not attempting to finish the sentence—“that
401543	401576	401540	401540	you	392	” The astonishment depicted in the Captain ’s features positively frightened Mr Toots , whose eyes were quite fixed by it , so that he could not withdraw them from his face . “
401579	401584	401587	401588	Sol Gills	248	” echoed the Captain . “
401590	401591	401587	401588	Sol Gills	248	” “
401594	401600	401620	401620	you	0	” said the old man , “
401617	401618	401614	401614	I	0	” “
401626	401631	401632	401632	Ay	451	” repeated the Captain . “
401634	401640	401632	401632	Ay	451	” said the old man . “
401661	401701	401656	401656	I	0	” The Captain took off his glazed hat , hung it on his hook , and smoothing his hair from behind with his hand , sat gazing at the group around him : a perfect image of wondering resignation . “
401712	401717	401718	401719	Sol Gills	248	” observed old Sol . “
401721	401741	401718	401719	Sol Gills	248	” returned the Captain , after staring at him and the rest for a long time , without speaking , “
401772	401784	401788	401788	Ned	392	” said the Captain , ruminating , and staring all round . “
401790	401795	401788	401788	Ned	392	” said Sol Gills , “
401809	401810	401802	401802	you	392	” “
401817	401822	401802	401802	you	392	” said the Captain . “
401832	401833	401827	401827	I	0	” “
401838	401844	401827	401827	I	0	” said the old man . “
401849	401866	401827	401827	I	0	” answered the Captain , eyeing him attentively , and proceeding to quote it from memory . “
401896	401898	401900	401901	the Captain	10100	Wal”r ! ”
401919	401929	401931	401933	the old man	1205	“ Well , Ned . Now attend a moment ! ”
401935	402061	401931	401933	the old man	1205	“ When I wrote first — that was from Barbados — I said that though you would receive that letter long before the year was out , I should be glad if you would open the packet , as it explained the reason of my going away . Very good , Ned . When I wrote the second , third , and perhaps the fourth times — that was from Jamaica — I said I was in just the same state , could n’t rest , and could n’t come away from that part of the world , without knowing that my boy was lost or saved . When I wrote next — that , I think , was from Demerara , was n’t it ? ”
402062	402073	402075	402076	the Captain	10100	“ That he thinks was from Demerara , warn’t it ! ”
402082	402087	402089	402090	old Sol	248	“ — I said , ”
402092	402204	402089	402090	old Sol	248	“ that still there was no certain information got yet . That I found many captains and others , in that part of the world , who had known me for years , and who assisted me with a passage here and there , and for whom I was able , now and then , to do a little in return , in my own craft . That everyone was sorry for me , and seemed to take a sort of interest in my wanderings ; and that I began to think it would be my fate to cruise about in search of tidings of my boy , until I died . ”
402205	402218	402220	402221	the Captain	10100	“ Began to think as how he was a scientific Flying Dutchman ! ”
402231	402292	402294	402296	the old man	1205	“ But when the news come one day , Ned,—that was to Barbados , after I got back there,—that a China trader home’ard bound had been spoke , that had my boy aboard , then , Ned , I took passage in the next ship and came home ; arrived at home tonight to find it true , thank God ! ”
402334	402399	402401	402402	the Captain	10100	“ Sol Gills ! The observation as I ’m a - going to make is calc’lated to blow every stitch of sail as you can carry , clean out of the bolt - ropes , and bring you on your beam ends with a lurch . Not one of them letters was ever delivered to Ed’ard Cuttle . Not one o ’ them letters , ”
402414	402441	402401	402402	the Captain	10100	“ was ever delivered unto Ed’ard Cuttle , Mariner , of England , as lives at home at ease , and doth improve each shining hour ! ”
402442	402462	402464	402465	old Sol	248	“ And posted by my own hand ! And directed by my own hand , Number nine Brig Place ! ”
402486	402504	402506	402507	the Captain	10100	“ What do you mean , Sol Gills , my friend , by Number nine Brig Place ? ”
402509	402517	402519	402521	the old man	1205	“ Mean ? Your lodgings , Ned , ”
402523	402561	402519	402521	the old man	1205	“ Mrs What’s - her - name ! I shall forget my own name next , but I am behind the present time — I always was , you recollect — and very much confused . Mrs — ”
402562	402566	402568	402569	the Captain	10100	“ Sol Gills ! ”
402584	402600	402573	402573	he	10100	“ it ai n’t the name of MacStinger as you ’re a trying to remember ? ”
402601	402607	402609	402612	the Instrument - maker	1191	“ Of course it is ! ”
402614	402623	402609	402612	the Instrument - maker	1191	“ To be sure Ned . Mrs MacStinger ! ”
402671	402686	402687	402687	he	10100	“ Overhaul that there again , Sol Gills , will you be so kind ? ”
402692	402697	402687	402687	he	10100	“ All these letters , ”
402738	402767	402768	402769	The Captain	10100	“ I posted with my own hand , and directed with my own hand , to Captain Cuttle , at Mrs MacStinger ’s , Number nine Brig Place . ”
402790	402796	402798	402799	the Captain	10100	“ Why , friends all , ”
402810	402818	402798	402799	the Captain	10100	“ I cut and run from there ! ”
402819	402832	402834	402834	Walter	293	“ And no one knew where you were gone , Captain Cuttle ? ”
402837	402842	402834	402834	Walter	293	“ Bless your heart , Wal”r
402844	402853	402854	402854	she	8796	” said the Captain , shaking his head , “
402885	402887	402889	402890	the Captain	10100	Wal”r ! ”
402892	402917	402889	402890	the Captain	10100	“ you ’ve only seen her in a calm ! But see her when her angry passions rise — and make a note on ! ”
402918	402925	402927	402928	the Nipper	241	“ I ’d give it her ! ”
402932	402943	402945	402946	the Captain	10100	“ Would you , do you think , my dear ? ”
402952	403015	403017	403018	the Captain	10100	“ Well , my dear , it does you credit . But there ai n’t no wild animal I would n’t sooner face myself . I only got my chest away by means of a friend as nobody ’s a match for . It was no good sending any letter there . She would n’t take in any letter , bless you , ”
403020	403042	403017	403018	the Captain	10100	“ under them circumstances ! Why , you could hardly make it worth a man ’s while to be the postman ! ”
403043	403065	403067	403067	Walter	293	“ Then it ’s pretty clear , Captain Cuttle , that all of us , and you and Uncle Sol especially , ”
403069	403079	403067	403067	Walter	293	“ may thank Mrs MacStinger for no small anxiety . ”
403357	403361	403363	403363	Walter	293	“ Mr Toots , ”
403374	403385	403363	403363	Walter	293	“ we shall see each other to - morrow morning ? ”
403386	403390	403392	403393	Mr Toots	504	“ Lieutenant Walters , ”
403400	403407	403392	403393	Mr Toots	504	“ I shall certainly be present . ”
403408	403430	403432	403432	Walter	293	“ This is the last night we shall meet for a long time — the last night we may ever meet , ”
403434	403468	403432	403432	Walter	293	“ Such a noble heart as yours , must feel , I think , when another heart is bound to it . I hope you know that I am very grateful to you ? ”
403469	403472	403474	403475	Mr Toots	504	“ Walters , ”
403480	403495	403474	403475	Mr Toots	504	“ I should be glad to feel that you had reason to be so . ”
403496	403499	403501	403501	Walter	293	“ Florence , ”
403503	403543	403501	403501	Walter	293	“ on this last night of her bearing her own name , has made me promise — it was only just now , when you left us together — that I would tell you — with her dear love — ”
403560	403567	403569	403569	Walter	293	“ — With her dear love , ”
403571	403634	403569	403569	Walter	293	“ that she can never have a friend whom she will value above you . That the recollection of your true consideration for her always , can never be forgotten by her . That she remembers you in her prayers tonight , and hopes that you will think of her when she is far away . Shall I say anything for you ? ”
403635	403640	403642	403643	Mr Toots	504	“ Say , Walter , ”
403646	403703	403642	403643	Mr Toots	504	“ that I shall think of her every day , but never without feeling happy to know that she is married to the man she loves , and who loves her . Say , if you please , that I am sure her husband deserves her — even her!—and that I am glad of her choice . ”
404003	404008	404010	404011	the Chicken	5067	“ Now , Master , ”
404027	404051	404016	404016	he	5067	“ I want to know whether this here gammon is to finish it , or whether you ’re a going in to win ? ”
404052	404055	404057	404058	Mr Toots	504	“ Chicken , ”
404060	404064	404057	404058	Mr Toots	504	“ explain yourself . ”
404065	404077	404079	404080	the Chicken	504	“ Why then , here ’s all about it , Master , ”
404082	404109	404079	404080	the Chicken	504	“ I ai n’t a cove to chuck a word away . Here ’s wot it is . Are any on ’em to be doubled up ? ”
404152	404157	404159	404160	the Chicken	5067	“ Come , Master , ”
404162	404173	404159	404160	the Chicken	5067	“ Is it to be gammon or pluck ? Which ? ”
404174	404177	404179	404180	Mr Toots	504	“ Chicken , ”
404182	404194	404179	404180	Mr Toots	504	“ your expressions are coarse , and your meaning is obscure . ”
404195	404207	404209	404210	the Chicken	504	“ Why , then , I tell you what , Master , ”
404212	404223	404209	404210	the Chicken	504	“ This is where it is . It ’s mean . ”
404224	404231	404233	404234	Mr Toots	504	“ What is mean , Chicken ? ”
404236	404240	404242	404243	the Chicken	504	“ It is , ”
404254	404277	404242	404243	the Chicken	504	“ There ! Now , Master ! Wot ! When you could go and blow on this here match to the stiff’un ; ”
404297	404330	404332	404333	the Chicken	5067	“ and when you could knock the winner and all the kit of ’em dead out o ’ wind and time , are you going to give in ? To give in ? ”
404339	404346	404332	404333	the Chicken	5067	“ Wy , it ’s mean ! ”
404347	404350	404352	404353	Mr Toots	504	“ Chicken , ”
404357	404369	404352	404353	Mr Toots	504	“ you ’re a perfect Vulture ! Your sentiments are atrocious . ”
404370	404380	404382	404383	the Chicken	5067	“ My sentiments is Game and Fancy , Master , ”
404385	404441	404443	404444	the Chicken	5067	“ That ’s wot my sentiments is . I ca n’t abear a meanness . I ’m afore the public , I ’m to be heerd on at the bar of the Little Helephant , and no Gov’ner o ’ mine must n’t go and do what ’s mean . Wy , it ’s mean , ”
404450	404461	404443	404444	the Chicken	5067	“ That ’s where it is . It ’s mean . ”
404462	404465	404467	404468	Mr Toots	504	“ Chicken , ”
404470	404475	404467	404468	Mr Toots	504	“ you disgust me . ”
404476	404479	404481	404482	the Chicken	5067	“ Master , ”
404489	404513	404481	404482	the Chicken	5067	“ there ’s a pair on us , then . Come ! Here ’s a offer ! You ’ve spoke to me more than once”t
404537	404538	404539	404539	Chicken	504	” “
404541	404546	404539	404539	Chicken	504	” returned Mr Toots , “
404565	404566	404592	404592	Master	6313	” “
404570	404575	404592	404592	Master	6313	” said the Chicken . “
404600	404622	404592	404592	Master	6313	” said the Chicken ; who seemed equally unable to get beyond that point , and to stop short of it . “
404633	404874	404875	404875	Baptists	8838	” So Mr Toots and the Chicken agreed to part on this incompatibility of moral perception ; and Mr Toots lying down to sleep , dreamed happily of Florence , who had thought of him as her friend upon the last night of her maiden life , and who had sent him her dear love . CHAPTER LVII . Another Wedding Mr Sownds the beadle , and Mrs Miff the pew - opener , are early at their posts in the fine church where Mr Dombey was married . A yellow - faced old gentleman from India , is going to take unto himself a young wife this morning , and six carriages full of company are expected , and Mrs Miff has been informed that the yellow - faced old gentleman could pave the road to church with diamonds and hardly miss them . The nuptial benediction is to be a superior one , proceeding from a very reverend , a dean , and the lady is to be given away , as an extraordinary present , by somebody who comes express from the Horse Guards . Mrs Miff is more intolerant of common people this morning , than she generally is ; and she has always strong opinions on that subject , for it is associated with free sittings . Mrs Miff is not a student of political economy ( she thinks the science is connected with dissenters ; “
404885	404905	404906	404906	Drat	642	” she says ) , but she can never understand what business your common folks have to be married . “
404909	404913	404914	404914	you	8842	” says Mrs Miff “
404928	404950	404906	404906	Drat	642	” Mr Sownds the beadle is more liberal than Mrs Miff — but then he is not a pew - opener . “
404958	404962	404956	404956	Ma’am	10816	” he says . “
404996	405001	404994	404994	Ma’am	10816	” says Mr Sownds , “
405008	405068	404966	404966	’em	8846	” Mr Sownds is sitting on the steps and Mrs Miff is dusting in the church , when a young couple , plainly dressed , come in . The mortified bonnet of Mrs Miff is sharply turned towards them , for she espies in this early visit indications of a runaway match . But they do n’t want to be married—“Only
405070	405075	404966	404966	’em	8846	” says the gentleman , “
405082	405160	404966	404966	’em	8846	” And as he slips a genteel compliment into the palm of Mrs Miff , her vinegary face relaxes , and her mortified bonnet and her spare dry figure dip and crackle . Mrs Miff resumes her dusting and plumps up her cushions — for the yellow - faced old gentleman is reported to have tender knees — but keeps her glazed , pew - opening eye on the young couple who are walking round the church . “
405163	405181	404966	404966	’em	8846	” coughs Mrs Miff whose cough is drier than the hay in any hassock in her charge , “
405201	405257	405196	405196	I	0	” They are looking at a tablet on the wall , erected to the memory of someone dead . They are a long way off from Mrs Miff , but Mrs Miff can see with half an eye how she is leaning on his arm , and how his head is bent down over her . “
405262	405267	405196	405196	I	0	” says Mrs Miff , “
405280	405414	405276	405278	a tidy pair	8854	” There is nothing personal in Mrs Miff ’s remark . She merely speaks of stock - in - trade . She is hardly more curious in couples than in coffins . She is such a spare , straight , dry old lady — such a pew of a woman — that you should find as many individual sympathies in a chip . Mr Sownds , now , who is fleshy , and has scarlet in his coat , is of a different temperament . He says , as they stand upon the steps watching the young couple away , that she has a pretty figure , has n’t she , and as well as he could see ( for she held her head down coming out ) , an uncommon pretty face . “
405420	405428	405429	405429	she	8855	” says Mr Sownds with a relish , “
405440	405506	405429	405429	she	8855	” Mrs Miff assents with a spare nod of her mortified bonnet ; but approves of this so little , that she inwardly resolves she would n’t be the wife of Mr Sownds for any money he could give her , Beadle as he is . And what are the young couple saying as they leave the church , and go out at the gate ? “
405522	405523	405513	405513	I	0	” “
405541	405573	405513	405513	I	0	” Florence lifts her eyes , so bright with tears , to his kind face ; and clasps her disengaged hand on that other modest little hand which clasps his arm . “
405593	405594	405513	405513	I	0	” “
405605	405606	405596	405596	you	197	” “
405631	406754	405624	405624	I	0	” And thus — not much changed — she , as innocent and earnest - hearted — he , as frank , as hopeful , and more proud of her — Florence and Walter , on their bridal morning , walk through the streets together . Not even in that childish walk of long ago , were they so far removed from all the world about them as today . The childish feet of long ago , did not tread such enchanted ground as theirs do now . The confidence and love of children may be given many times , and will spring up in many places ; but the woman ’s heart of Florence , with its undivided treasure , can be yielded only once , and under slight or change , can only droop and die . They take the streets that are the quietest , and do not go near that in which her old home stands . It is a fair , warm summer morning , and the sun shines on them , as they walk towards the darkening mist that overspreads the City . Riches are uncovering in shops ; jewels , gold , and silver flash in the goldsmith ’s sunny windows ; and great houses cast a stately shade upon them as they pass . But through the light , and through the shade , they go on lovingly together , lost to everything around ; thinking of no other riches , and no prouder home , than they have now in one another . Gradually they come into the darker , narrower streets , where the sun , now yellow , and now red , is seen through the mist , only at street corners , and in small open spaces where there is a tree , or one of the innumerable churches , or a paved way and a flight of steps , or a curious little patch of garden , or a burying - ground , where the few tombs and tombstones are almost black . Lovingly and trustfully , through all the narrow yards and alleys and the shady streets , Florence goes , clinging to his arm , to be his wife . Her heart beats quicker now , for Walter tells her that their church is very near . They pass a few great stacks of warehouses , with waggons at the doors , and busy carmen stopping up the way — but Florence does not see or hear them — and then the air is quiet , and the day is darkened , and she is trembling in a church which has a strange smell like a cellar . The shabby little old man , ringer of the disappointed bell , is standing in the porch , and has put his hat in the font — for he is quite at home there , being sexton . He ushers them into an old brown , panelled , dusty vestry , like a corner - cupboard with the shelves taken out ; where the wormy registers diffuse a smell like faded snuff , which has set the tearful Nipper sneezing . Youthful , and how beautiful , the young bride looks , in this old dusty place , with no kindred object near her but her husband . There is a dusty old clerk , who keeps a sort of evaporated news shop underneath an archway opposite , behind a perfect fortification of posts . There is a dusty old pew - opener who only keeps herself , and finds that quite enough to do . There is a dusty old beadle ( these are Mr Toots ’s beadle and pew - opener of last Sunday ) , who has something to do with a Worshipful Company who have got a Hall in the next yard , with a stained - glass window in it that no mortal ever saw . There are dusty wooden ledges and cornices poked in and out over the altar , and over the screen and round the gallery , and over the inscription about what the Master and Wardens of the Worshipful Company did in one thousand six hundred and ninety - four . There are dusty old sounding - boards over the pulpit and reading - desk , looking like lids to be let down on the officiating ministers in case of their giving offence . There is every possible provision for the accommodation of dust , except in the churchyard , where the facilities in that respect are very limited . The Captain , Uncle Sol , and Mr Toots are come ; the clergyman is putting on his surplice in the vestry , while the clerk walks round him , blowing the dust off it ; and the bride and bridegroom stand before the altar . There is no bridesmaid , unless Susan Nipper is one ; and no better father than Captain Cuttle . A man with a wooden leg , chewing a faint apple and carrying a blue bag in has hand , looks in to see what is going on ; but finding it nothing entertaining , stumps off again , and pegs his way among the echoes out of doors . No gracious ray of light is seen to fall on Florence , kneeling at the altar with her timid head bowed down . The morning luminary is built out , and do n’t shine there . There is a meagre tree outside , where the sparrows are chirping a little ; and there is a blackbird in an eyelet - hole of sun in a dyer ’s garret , over against the window , who whistles loudly whilst the service is performing ; and there is the man with the wooden leg stumping away . The amens of the dusty clerk appear , like Macbeth ’s , to stick in his throat a little ; but Captain Cuttle helps him out , and does it with so much goodwill that he interpolates three entirely new responses of that word , never introduced into the service before . They are married , and have signed their names in one of the old sneezy registers , and the clergyman ’s surplice is restored to the dust , and the clergyman is gone home . In a dark corner of the dark church , Florence has turned to Susan Nipper , and is weeping in her arms . Mr Toots ’s eyes are red . The Captain lubricates his nose . Uncle Sol has pulled down his spectacles from his forehead , and walked out to the door . “
406802	407113	407114	407115	Miss Floy	197	” They have thought it better not to go back to the Midshipman , but to part so ; a coach is waiting for them , near at hand . Miss Nipper can not speak ; she only sobs and chokes , and hugs her mistress . Mr Toots advances , urges her to cheer up , and takes charge of her . Florence gives him her hand — gives him , in the fulness of her heart , her lips — kisses Uncle Sol , and Captain Cuttle , and is borne away by her young husband . But Susan can not bear that Florence should go away with a mournful recollection of her . She had meant to be so different , that she reproaches herself bitterly . Intent on making one last effort to redeem her character , she breaks from Mr Toots and runs away to find the coach , and show a parting smile . The Captain , divining her object , sets off after her ; for he feels it his duty also to dismiss them with a cheer , if possible . Uncle Sol and Mr Toots are left behind together , outside the church , to wait for them . The coach is gone , but the street is steep , and narrow , and blocked up , and Susan can see it at a stand - still in the distance , she is sure . Captain Cuttle follows her as she flies down the hill , and waves his glazed hat as a general signal , which may attract the right coach and which may not . Susan outstrips the Captain , and comes up with it . She looks in at the window , sees Walter , with the gentle face beside him , and claps her hands and screams : “
407145	407178	407179	407179	We	8862	” How Susan does it , she do n’t know , but she reaches to the window , kisses her , and has her arms about her neck , in a moment . “
407193	407205	407206	407206	You	197	” says Susan , with a suspicious catching in her breath . “
407221	407222	407219	407219	you	197	” “
407227	407228	407225	407225	Susan	241	” “
407252	407256	407240	407240	I	0	” exclaims Susan ; “
407280	407281	407282	407282	Hooroar	179	” “
407289	407301	407282	407282	Hooroar	179	” vociferates the Captain , with a countenance of strong emotion . “
407304	407312	407282	407282	Hooroar	179	Wal”r my lad . Hooroar ! Hooroar ! ”
407425	407438	407413	407414	the Captain	10100	“ Hooroar , my lad ! Hooroar , my Heart ’s Delight ! ”
407885	407889	407882	407883	the Captain	10100	“ a picter , ”
407896	407905	407907	407908	the Captain	10100	“ A admiral ’s cabin , mind you , ”
407910	407916	407907	407908	the Captain	10100	“ ai n’t more trim . ”
407958	407994	407996	407997	the Captain	10100	“ Ed’ard Cuttle , my lad , you never shaped a better course in your life than when you made that there little property over jintly . You see how the land bore , Ed’ard , ”
407999	408009	407996	407997	the Captain	10100	“ and it does you credit , my lad . ”
408069	408078	408080	408082	old Sol Gills	248	“ My boy has been preserved and thrives , ”
408088	408101	408102	408103	The Captain	10100	“ What right have I to be otherwise than thankful and happy ! ”
408143	408173	408175	408175	his	10100	“ Sol ! There ’s the last bottle of the old Madeira down below . Would you wish to have it up tonight , my boy , and drink to Wal”r
408178	408218	408175	408176	his wife	9766	” The Instrument - maker , looking wistfully at the Captain , puts his hand into the breast - pocket of his coffee - coloured coat , brings forth his pocket - book , and takes a letter out . “
408223	408229	408175	408176	his wife	9766	” says the old man . “
408247	408248	408242	408242	I	0	” “
408291	408337	408342	408342	her	13145	“ ‘ Why , loving her beyond all earthly things , I have yet , without remorse , united her to the uncertainties and dangers of my life , I will not say to you . You know why , and you are her father . “
408350	408426	408427	408427	Solomon	248	“ ‘ I do not think or hope that you will ever forgive me . There is nothing I expect less . But if an hour should come when it will comfort you to believe that Florence has someone ever near her , the great charge of whose life is to cancel her remembrance of past sorrow , I solemnly assure you , you may , in that hour , rest in that belief . ’ ”
408450	408466	408468	408470	the old man	1205	“ We wo n’t drink the last bottle of the old Madeira yet , Ned , ”
408473	408477	408468	408470	the old man	1205	“ Not yet . “
408481	408486	408468	408470	the old man	1205	” assents the Captain . “
408492	408675	408468	408470	the old man	1205	” Susan and Mr Toots are of the same opinion . After a silence they all sit down to supper , and drink to the young husband and wife in something else ; and the last bottle of the old Madeira still remains among its dust and cobwebs , undisturbed . A few days have elapsed , and a stately ship is out at sea , spreading its white wings to the favouring wind . Upon the deck , image to the roughest man on board of something that is graceful , beautiful , and harmless — something that it is good and pleasant to have there , and that should make the voyage prosperous — is Florence . It is night , and she and Walter sit alone , watching the solemn path of light upon the sea between them and the moon . At length she can not see it plainly , for the tears that fill her eyes ; and then she lays her head down on his breast , and puts her arms around his neck , saying , “
408687	408710	408712	408712	I	0	” Her husband holds her to his heart , and they are very quiet , and the stately ship goes on serenely . “
408717	408721	408712	408712	I	0	” says Florence , “
408743	408744	408738	408738	me	0	” “
408756	409013	408746	408746	Paul	237	” Of Paul and Walter . And the voices in the waves are always whispering to Florence , in their ceaseless murmuring , of love — of love , eternal and illimitable , not bounded by the confines of this world , or by the end of time , but ranging still , beyond the sea , beyond the sky , to the invisible country far away ! CHAPTER LVIII . After a Lapse The sea had ebbed and flowed , through a whole year . Through a whole year , the winds and clouds had come and gone ; the ceaseless work of Time had been performed , in storm and sunshine . Through a whole year , the tides of human chance and change had set in their allotted courses . Through a whole year , the famous House of Dombey and Son had fought a fight for life , against cross accidents , doubtful rumours , unsuccessful ventures , unpropitious times , and most of all , against the infatuation of its head , who would not contract its enterprises by a hair ’s breadth , and would not listen to a word of warning that the ship he strained so hard against the storm , was weak , and could not bear it . The year was out , and the great House was down . One summer afternoon ; a year , wanting some odd days , after the marriage in the City church ; there was a buzz and whisper upon “
409407	409413	409416	409417	Mr Perch	366	“ things was going wrong . ”
409468	409483	409488	409488	he	366	“ twelve and ninepence in the pound , twelve and ninepence in the pound ! ”
409519	409537	409514	409514	he	366	“ Might I make so bold as ask , Sir , are you unhappy in your mind ? ”
409545	409558	409540	409541	Mr Dombey	533	“ My faithful Perch — but no , it can not be ! ”
409573	409579	409564	409564	his	533	“ Leave me , Perch ! ”
411069	411073	411074	411074	she	935	“ In mourning , ”
411120	411123	411124	411124	he	253	“ Alone ! ”
411127	411146	411147	411147	he	253	“ and John here this morning ! Is there anything the matter , my dear ? But no , ”
411150	411158	411147	411147	he	253	“ your face tells quite another story . ”
411159	411175	411176	411176	she	445	“ I am afraid it is a selfish revelation that you see there , then , ”
411179	411187	411189	411189	he	253	“ It is a very pleasant one , ”
411191	411213	411189	411189	he	253	“ and , if selfish , a novelty too , worth seeing in you . But I do n’t believe that . ”
411240	411263	411265	411265	Harriet	445	“ You will not be surprised at my coming alone , or at John ’s not having told you I was coming , ”
411267	411289	411265	411265	Harriet	445	“ and you will believe that , when I tell you why I have come . May I do so now ? ”
411290	411297	411189	411189	he	253	“ You can do nothing better . ”
411298	411304	411305	411305	He	253	“ You were not busy ? ”
411317	411351	411305	411305	He	253	“ I have been , all day . Here ’s my witness . I have been confiding all my cares to it . I wish I had none but my own to tell . ”
411352	411360	411362	411362	Harriet	445	“ Is the House at an end ? ”
411366	411372	411362	411362	Harriet	445	“ Completely at an end . ”
411373	411380	411305	411305	He	253	“ Will it never be resumed ? ”
411381	411384	411389	411389	her	445	“ Never . ”
411417	411472	411402	411402	He	253	“ Never . You remember what I told you . It has been , all along , impossible to convince him ; impossible to reason with him ; sometimes , impossible even to approach him . The worst has happened ; and the House has fallen , never to be built up any more . ”
411473	411483	411402	411402	He	253	“ And Mr Dombey , is he personally ruined ? ”
411484	411487	411402	411402	He	253	“ Ruined . ”
411488	411499	411504	411504	her	445	“ Will he have no private fortune left ? Nothing ? ”
411566	411731	411557	411557	his	253	“ The extent of Mr Dombey ’s resources is not accurately within my knowledge ; but though they are doubtless very large , his obligations are enormous . He is a gentleman of high honour and integrity . Any man in his position could , and many a man in his position would , have saved himself , by making terms which would have very slightly , almost insensibly , increased the losses of those who had had dealings with him , and left him a remnant to live upon . But he is resolved on payment to the last farthing of his means . His own words are , that they will clear , or nearly clear , the House , and that no one can lose much . Ah , Miss Harriet , it would do us no harm to remember oftener than we do , that vices are sometimes only virtues carried to excess ! His pride shows well in this . ”
411772	411779	411767	411767	she	9024	“ Have you seen him lately ? ”
411780	411892	411893	411893	He	9026	“ No one sees him . When this crisis of his affairs renders it necessary for him to come out of his house , he comes out for the occasion , and again goes home , and shuts himself up , and will see no one . He has written me a letter , acknowledging our past connexion in higher terms than it deserved , and parting from me . I am delicate of obtruding myself upon him now , never having had much intercourse with him in better times ; but I have tried to do so . I have written , gone there , entreated . Quite in vain . ”
411936	411944	411945	411945	he	9026	“ Well , well , Miss Harriet , ”
411953	411999	411945	411945	he	9026	“ this is not to the purpose . You have not come here to hear this . Some other and pleasanter theme is in your mind . Let it be in mine , too , and we shall talk upon more equal terms . Come ! ”
412000	412009	412011	412011	Harriet	443	“ No , it is the same theme , ”
412019	412079	411945	411945	he	9026	“ Is it not likely that it should be ? Is it not natural that John and I should have been thinking and speaking very much of late of these great changes ? Mr Dombey , whom he served so many years — you know upon what terms — reduced , as you describe ; and we quite rich ! ”
412144	412151	412153	412153	Harriet	443	“ I need not remind you , ”
412164	412195	412153	412153	Harriet	443	“ through what means our circumstances changed . You have not forgotten that our brother James , upon that dreadful day , left no will , no relations but ourselves . ”
412226	412230	412231	412231	she	443	“ You know , ”
412234	412330	412231	412231	she	443	“ our history , the history of both my brothers , in connexion with the unfortunate , unhappy gentleman , of whom you have spoken so truly . You know how few our wants are — John ’s and mine — and what little use we have for money , after the life we have led together for so many years ; and now that he is earning an income that is ample for us , through your kindness . You are not unprepared to hear what favour I have come to ask of you ? ”
412331	412352	412457	412457	she	9029	“ I hardly know . I was , a minute ago . Now , I think , I am not . ”
412353	412424	412425	412425	She	9029	“ Of my dead brother I say nothing . If the dead know what we do — but you understand me . Of my living brother I could say much ; but what need I say more , than that this act of duty , in which I have come to ask your indispensable assistance , is his own , and that he can not rest until it is performed ! ”
412452	412456	412457	412457	she	9029	“ Dear Sir , ”
412463	412713	412457	412457	she	9029	“ it must be done very quietly and secretly . Your experience and knowledge will point out a way of doing it . Mr Dombey may , perhaps , be led to believe that it is something saved , unexpectedly , from the wreck of his fortunes ; or that it is a voluntary tribute to his honourable and upright character , from some of those with whom he has had great dealings ; or that it is some old lost debt repaid . There must be many ways of doing it . I know you will choose the best . The favour I have come to ask is , that you will do it for us in your own kind , generous , considerate manner . That you will never speak of it to John , whose chief happiness in this act of restitution is to do it secretly , unknown , and unapproved of : that only a very small part of the inheritance may be reserved to us , until Mr Dombey shall have possessed the interest of the rest for the remainder of his life ; that you will keep our secret , faithfully — but that I am sure you will ; and that , from this time , it may seldom be whispered , even between you and me , but may live in my thoughts only as a new reason for thankfulness to Heaven , and joy and pride in my brother . ”
412763	412768	412770	412771	Mr Morfin	253	“ My dear Harriet , ”
412777	412812	412770	412771	Mr Morfin	253	“ I was not prepared for this . Do I understand you that you wish to make your own part in the inheritance available for your good purpose , as well as John ’s ? ”
412813	412818	412819	412819	she	9032	“ Oh , yes , ”
412821	412876	412770	412771	Mr Morfin	253	“ When we have shared everything together for so long a time , and have had no care , hope , or purpose apart , could I bear to be excluded from my share in this ? May I not urge a claim to be my brother ’s partner and companion to the last ? ”
412877	412886	412887	412887	he	253	“ Heaven forbid that I should dispute it ! ”
412890	412899	412900	412900	she	9032	“ We may rely on your friendly help ? ”
412903	412909	412900	412900	she	9032	“ I knew we might ! ”
412910	413009	413010	413010	She	9033	“ I should be a worse man than,—than I hope I am , or would willingly believe myself , if I could not give you that assurance from my heart and soul . You may , implicitly . Upon my honour , I will keep your secret . And if it should be found that Mr Dombey is so reduced as I fear he will be , acting on a determination that there seem to be no means of influencing , I will assist you to accomplish the design , on which you and John are jointly resolved . ”
413026	413029	413030	413030	he	9034	“ Harriet , ”
413038	413191	413030	413030	he	9034	“ To speak to you of the worth of any sacrifice that you can make now — above all , of any sacrifice of mere money — would be idle and presumptuous . To put before you any appeal to reconsider your purpose or to set narrow limits to it , would be , I feel , not less so . I have no right to mar the great end of a great history , by any obtrusion of my own weak self . I have every right to bend my head before what you confide to me , satisfied that it comes from a higher and better source of inspiration than my poor worldly knowledge . I will say only this : I am your faithful steward ; and I would rather be so , and your chosen friend , than I would be anybody in the world , except yourself . ”
413206	413212	413213	413213	he	9036	“ Are you going home ? ”
413216	413223	413213	413213	he	9036	“ Let me go with you . ”
413224	413250	413192	413192	She	9035	“ Not tonight . I am not going home now ; I have a visit to make alone . Will you come to - morrow ? ”
413251	413256	413258	413258	he	9036	“ Well , well , ”
413260	413310	413258	413258	he	9036	“ I ’ll come to - morrow . In the meantime , I ’ll think of this , and how we can best proceed . And perhaps I ’ll think of it , dear Harriet , and — and — think of me a little in connexion with it . ”
413727	413737	413739	413739	Harriet	443	“ How is your patient , nurse , tonight ? ”
413741	413769	413771	413776	the woman of the light complexion	9056	“ In a poor way , Miss , I am afraid . Oh how she do remind me , sometimes , of my Uncle ’s Betsey Jane ! ”
413785	413790	413792	413792	Harriet	443	“ In what respect ? ”
413794	413801	413803	413804	the other	10537	“ Miss , in all respects , ”
413806	413829	413803	413804	the other	10537	“ except that she ’s grown up , and Betsey Jane , when at death ’s door , was but a child . ”
413830	413839	413841	413841	Harriet	443	“ But you have told me she recovered , ”
413844	413857	413841	413841	Harriet	443	“ so there is the more reason for hope , Mrs Wickam . ”
413858	413878	413880	413881	Mrs Wickam	302	“ Ah , Miss , hope is an excellent thing for such as has the spirits to bear it ! ”
413887	413914	413880	413881	Mrs Wickam	302	“ My own spirits is not equal to it , but I do n’t owe it any grudge . I envys them that is so blest ! ”
413915	413924	413926	413926	Harriet	443	“ You should try to be more cheerful , ”
413928	413938	413940	413941	Mrs Wickam	302	“ Thank you , Miss , I ’m sure , ”
413944	414020	413940	413941	Mrs Wickam	302	“ If I was so inclined , the loneliness of this situation — you’ll excuse my speaking so free — would put it out of my power , in four and twenty hours ; but I ai n’t at all . I ’d rather not . The little spirits that I ever had , I was bereaved of at Brighton some few years ago , and I think I feel myself the better for it . ”
414316	414319	414321	414322	the visitor	12215	“ Alice ! ”
414327	414333	414321	414322	the visitor	12215	“ am I late tonight ? ”
414334	414345	414346	414346	Harriet	443	“ You always seem late , but are always early . ”
414366	414371	414372	414373	Mrs Wickam	302	“ You are better ? ”
414400	414406	414408	414408	Alice	536	“ It matters very little ! ”
414415	414433	414408	414408	Alice	536	“ Better or worse today , is but a day ’s difference — perhaps not so much . ”
414491	414505	414443	414443	her	302	“ while we are here , let us repeat the mixture as before . ”
414506	414509	414511	414511	Alice	536	“ No , ”
414518	414568	414511	414511	Alice	536	“ evil courses , and remorse , travel , want , and weather , storm within , and storm without , have worn my life away . It will not last much longer . She drew the hand up as she spoke , and laid her face against it . “
414617	414768	414780	414780	I	0	” How different her hold upon the hand , from what it had been when she took it by the fireside on the bleak winter evening ! Scorn , rage , defiance , recklessness , look here ! This is the end . Mrs Wickam having clinked sufficiently among the bottles , now produced the mixture . Mrs Wickam looked hard at her patient in the act of drinking , screwed her mouth up tight , her eyebrows also , and shook her head , expressing that tortures should n’t make her say it was a hopeless case . Mrs Wickam then sprinkled a little cooling - stuff about the room , with the air of a female grave - digger , who was strewing ashes on ashes , dust on dust — for she was a serious character — and withdrew to partake of certain funeral baked meats downstairs . “
414774	414778	414780	414780	I	0	” asked Alice , “
414806	414807	414794	414794	you	5844	” “
414815	414819	414794	414794	you	5844	” said Harriet . “
414825	414835	414794	414794	you	5844	” said Alice , thoughtfully intent upon her face . “
414845	414848	414840	414840	you	5844	” Harriet answered “
414851	414852	414840	414840	you	5844	” “
414866	414878	414864	414864	Me	0	” said Alice , shrinking with her face behind her hand , “
414895	414980	414981	414981	Mother	12864	” Harriet bending over her , composed and soothed her . By and bye , Alice lying as before , with the hand against her face , asked to have her mother called . Harriet called to her more than once , but the old woman was so absorbed looking out at the open window on the darkness , that she did not hear . It was not until Harriet went to her and touched her , that she rose up , and came . “
414983	415016	414981	414981	Mother	12864	” said Alice , taking the hand again , and fixing her lustrous eyes lovingly upon her visitor , while she merely addressed a motion of her finger to the old woman , “
415023	415024	415018	415018	her	9083	” “
415030	415031	415034	415034	mother	12864	” “
415036	415044	415034	415034	mother	12864	” answered Alice , faintly and solemnly , “
415047	415116	415117	415119	My handsome gal	9086	” The old woman , whose wits appeared disorderly by alarm , remorse , or grief , came creeping along the side of the bed , opposite to that on which Harriet sat ; and kneeling down , so as to bring her withered face upon a level with the coverlet , and stretching out her hand , so as to touch her daughter ’s arm , began : “
415121	415146	415117	415119	My handsome gal	9086	” Heaven , what a cry was that , with which she stopped there , gazing at the poor form lying on the bed ! “
415159	415168	415152	415152	mother	12864	” said Alice , without looking at her . “
415176	415177	415179	415180	My daughter	1612	” “
415182	415188	415179	415180	My daughter	1612	” faltered the old woman , “
415206	415225	415202	415202	her	1612	” Alice smiled mournfully at Harriet , and fondled her hand a little closer , but said nothing . “
415235	415250	415232	415232	I	0	” repeated the old woman , menacing the vacant air with her shrivelled fist , “
415271	415288	415267	415267	she	1612	shall!”—as if she were in passionate contention with some unseen opponent at the bedside , who contradicted her—“my
415366	415388	415356	415356	I	0	” Harriet glanced from the old woman to the lustrous eyes intent upon her face , and derived corroboration from them . “
415391	415406	415356	415356	I	0	” cried the old woman , her nodding head bridling with a ghastly vanity . “
415450	415462	415438	415438	I	0	” stretching out her arm to Harriet , across the bed , “
415528	415589	415590	415590	They	1825	” She raised her head a little , and peered at her daughter ’s face ; as if from the remembrance of her own youth , she had flown to the remembrance of her child ’s . Then , suddenly , she laid her face down on the bed , and shut her head up in her hands and arms . “
415595	415701	415590	415590	They	1825	” said the old woman , without looking up , as you could see two brothers , so near an age — there was n’t much more than a year between them , as I recollect — and if you could have seen my gal , as I have seen her once , side by side with the other ’s daughter , you ’d have seen , for all the difference of dress and life , that they were like each other . Oh ! is the likeness gone , and is it my gal — only my gal — that ’s to change so ! ”
415702	415714	415716	415716	Alice	536	“ We shall all change , mother , in our turn , ”
415718	415721	415723	415725	the old woman	10432	“ Turn ! ”
415727	415790	415723	415725	the old woman	10432	“ but why not hers as soon as my gal ’s ! The mother must have changed — she looked as old as me , and full as wrinkled through her paint — but she was handsome . What have I done , I , what have I done worse than her , that only my gal is to lie there fading ! ”
415829	415945	415947	415949	the old woman	10432	“ That ’s what Alice bade me tell you , deary . That ’s all . I found it out when I began to ask who she was , and all about her , away in Warwickshire there , one summer - time . Such relations was no good to me , then . They would n’t have owned me , and had nothing to give me . I should have asked ’em , maybe , for a little money , afterwards , if it had n’t been for my Alice ; she ’d a’most have killed me , if I had , I think . She was as proud as t’other in her way , ”
415964	415998	415947	415949	the old woman	10432	“ for all she ’s so quiet now ; but she ’ll shame ’em with her good looks yet . Ha , ha ! She ’ll shame ’em , will my handsome daughter ! ”
416070	416262	416066	416066	She	10432	“ I have felt , lying here , that I should like you to know this . It might explain , I have thought , something that used to help to harden me . I had heard so much , in my wrongdoing , of my neglected duty , that I took up with the belief that duty had not been done to me , and that as the seed was sown , the harvest grew . I somehow made it out that when ladies had bad homes and mothers , they went wrong in their way , too ; but that their way was not so foul a one as mine , and they had need to bless God for it . That is all past . It is like a dream , now , which I can not quite remember or understand . It has been more and more like a dream , every day , since you began to sit here , and to read to me . I only tell it you , as I can recollect it . Will you read to me a little more ? ”
416281	416319	416274	416274	Alice	536	“ You will not forget my mother ? I forgive her , if I have any cause . I know that she forgives me , and is sorry in her heart . You will not forget her ? ”
416320	416325	416274	416274	Alice	536	“ Never , Alice ! ”
416326	416352	416274	416274	Alice	536	“ A moment yet . Lay your head so , dear , that as you read I may see the words in your kind face . ”
416507	416512	416514	416514	Harriet	443	“ I shall come , ”
416522	416529	416517	416517	she	443	“ very early in the morning . ”
416889	416899	416877	416878	The women	13879	“ a hun - dred thou - sand pound ! ”
417218	417221	417207	417208	Mrs Perch	370	“ girls , ”
417373	417388	417369	417369	Cook	408	“ Oh a long time , bless you ! Take your oath of that . ”
417443	417457	417459	417459	Cook	408	“ Ah , where he ’ll have his little garden , you know , ”
417462	417472	417459	417459	Cook	408	“ and bring up sweet peas in the spring . ”
417473	417477	417479	417480	Mr Towlinson	272	“ Exactly so , ”
417482	417494	417479	417480	Mr Towlinson	272	“ and be one of the Brethren of something or another . ”
417495	417501	417503	417504	Mrs Perch	370	“ We are all brethren , ”
417513	417518	417520	417521	Mr Perch	366	“ Except the sisters , ”
417523	417530	417532	417532	Cook	408	“ How are the mighty fallen ! ”
417534	417550	417552	417553	the housemaid	975	“ Pride shall have a fall , and it always was and will be so ! ”
417637	417646	417620	417620	her	9155	“ Suppose the wages should n’t be paid ! ”
417710	417722	417724	417724	Cook	408	“ Because if that is your religious feelings , Mary Daws , ”
417727	417739	417724	417724	Cook	408	“ I do n’t know where you mean to go to . ”
417876	417880	417868	417869	Mr Towlinson	272	“ Old Cock , ”
418058	418065	418067	418068	Mrs Pipchin	307	“ Your master ’s in difficulties , ”
418072	418080	418067	418068	Mrs Pipchin	307	“ You know that , I suppose ? ”
418095	418112	418114	418115	Mrs Pipchin	307	“ And you ’re all on the look - out for yourselves , I warrant you , ”
418131	418137	418118	418118	her	307	“ No more than yourself ! ”
418138	418150	418152	418154	the ireful Pipchin	307	“ That ’s your opinion , Mrs Impudence , is it ? ”
418166	418175	418177	418177	Cook	408	“ Yes , Mrs Pipchin , it is , ”
418181	418188	418177	418177	Cook	408	“ And what then , pray ? ”
418189	418202	418204	418205	Mrs Pipchin	307	“ Why , then you may go as soon as you like , ”
418207	418224	418204	418205	Mrs Pipchin	307	“ The sooner the better ; and I hope I shall never see your face again . ”
418297	418309	418311	418312	Mrs Pipchin	307	“ Now those that choose , can go about their business , ”
418314	418338	418342	418342	Pipchin	307	“ and those that choose can stay here on board wages for a week or so , and make themselves useful . Except , ”
418344	418356	418342	418342	Pipchin	307	“ that slut of a cook , who ’ll go immediately . ”
418357	418360	418362	418362	Cook	408	“ That , ”
418364	418392	418362	418362	Cook	408	“ she certainly will ! I wish you good day , Mrs Pipchin , and sincerely wish I could compliment you on the sweetness of your appearance ! ”
418393	418399	418401	418402	Mrs Pipchin	307	“ Get along with you , ”
418557	418562	418551	418551	Cook	408	“ Hear , hear ! ”
418597	418604	418584	418584	he	272	“ Go one , go all ! ”
418747	418749	418789	418790	Mrs Perch	370	“ smash ”
418820	418824	418826	418828	the good woman	9203	“ For what , ”
418830	418857	418826	418828	the good woman	9203	“ must his feelings be , if he was to come upon any of the poor servants that he once deceived into thinking him immensely rich ! ”
419936	419945	419947	419948	Mrs Chick	208	“ How is my brother , Mrs Pipchin ? ”
419950	419961	419963	419964	Mrs Pipchin	307	“ I do n’t know any more than the deuce , ”
419966	420038	419963	419964	Mrs Pipchin	307	“ He never does me the honour to speak to me . He has his meat and drink put in the next room to his own ; and what he takes , he comes out and takes when there ’s nobody there . It ’s no use asking me . I know no more about him than the man in the south who burnt his mouth by eating cold plum porridge . ”
420048	420054	420042	420042	Pipchin	307	“ But good gracious me ! ”
420060	420119	420056	420057	Mrs Chick	208	“ How long is this to last ! If my brother will not make an effort , Mrs Pipchin , what is to become of him ? I am sure I should have thought he had seen enough of the consequences of not making an effort , by this time , to be warned against that fatal error . ”
420120	420124	420126	420127	Mrs Pipchin	307	“ Hoity toity ! ”
420133	420176	420126	420127	Mrs Pipchin	307	“ There ’s a great fuss , I think , about it . It ai n’t so wonderful a case . People have had misfortunes before now , and been obliged to part with their furniture . I ’m sure I have ! ”
420177	420181	420183	420184	Mrs Chick	208	“ My brother , ”
420187	420364	420126	420127	Mrs Pipchin	307	“ is so peculiar — so strange a man . He is the most peculiar man I ever saw . Would anyone believe that when he received news of the marriage and emigration of that unnatural child — it ’s a comfort to me , now , to remember that I always said there was something extraordinary about that child : but nobody minds me — would anybody believe , I say , that he should then turn round upon me and say he had supposed , from my manner , that she had come to my house ? Why , my gracious ! And would anybody believe that when I merely say to him , ‘ Paul , I may be very foolish , and I have no doubt I am , but I can not understand how your affairs can have got into this state , ’ he should actually fly at me , and request that I will come to see him no more until he asks me ! Why , my goodness ! ”
420365	420368	420370	420371	Mrs Pipchin	307	“ Ah ! ”
420373	420398	420370	420371	Mrs Pipchin	307	“ It ’s a pity he had n’t a little more to do with mines . They ’d have tried his temper for him . ”
420399	420403	420405	420406	Mrs Chick	208	“ And what , ”
420416	420507	420508	420509	Mrs Chick	208	“ is it to end in ? That ’s what I want to know . What does my brother mean to do ? He must do something . It ’s of no use remaining shut up in his own rooms . Business wo n’t come to him . No . He must go to it . Then why do n’t he go ? He knows where to go , I suppose , having been a man of business all his life . Very good . Then why not go there ? ”
420528	420531	420533	420535	the discreet lady	5234	“ Besides , ”
420542	420768	420533	420535	the discreet lady	5234	“ who ever heard of such obstinacy as his staying shut up here through all these dreadful disagreeables ? It ’s not as if there was no place for him to go to . Of course he could have come to our house . He knows he is at home there , I suppose ? Mr Chick has perfectly bored about it , and I said with my own lips , ‘ Why surely , Paul , you do n’t imagine that because your affairs have got into this state , you are the less at home to such near relatives as ourselves ? You do n’t imagine that we are like the rest of the world ? ’ But no ; here he stays all through , and here he is . Why , good gracious me , suppose the house was to be let ! What would he do then ? He could n’t remain here then . If he attempted to do so , there would be an ejectment , an action for Doe , and all sorts of things ; and then he must go . Then why not go at first instead of at last ? And that brings me back to what I said just now , and I naturally ask what is to be the end of it ? ”
420769	420788	420790	420791	Mrs Pipchin	307	“ I know what ’s to be the end of it , as far as I am concerned , ”
420793	420812	420790	420791	Mrs Pipchin	307	“ and that ’s enough for me . I ’m going to take myself off in a jiffy . ”
420813	420821	420823	420824	Mrs Chick	208	“ In a which , Mrs Pipchin , ”
420826	420831	420823	420824	Mrs Chick	208	“ In a jiffy , ”
420837	420852	420854	420855	Mrs Chick	208	“ Ah , well ! really I ca n’t blame you , Mrs Pipchin , ”
420860	420875	420877	420879	the sardonic Pipchin	307	“ It would be pretty much the same to me , if you could , ”
420881	420986	420877	420879	the sardonic Pipchin	307	“ At any rate I ’m going . I ca n’t stop here . I should be dead in a week . I had to cook my own pork chop yesterday , and I ’m not used to it . My constitution will be giving way next . Besides , I had a very fair connexion at Brighton when I came here — little Pankey ’s folks alone were worth a good eighty pounds a - year to me — and I ca n’t afford to throw it away . I ’ve written to my niece , and she expects me by this time . ”
420987	420995	420997	420998	Mrs Chick	208	“ Have you spoken to my brother ? ”
420999	421014	421016	421017	Mrs Pipchin	307	“ Oh , yes , it ’s very easy to say speak to him , ”
421019	421092	421016	421017	Mrs Pipchin	307	“ How is it done ? I called out to him yesterday , that I was no use here , and that he had better let me send for Mrs Richards . He grunted something or other that meant yes , and I sent . Grunt indeed ! If he had been Mr Pipchin , he ’d have had some reason to grunt . Yah ! I ’ve no patience with it ! ”
421205	421216	421218	421219	Mr Toodle	236	“ I tell you what , Polly , me dear , ”
421221	421334	421218	421219	Mr Toodle	236	“ being now an ingine - driver , and well to do in the world , I should n’t allow of your coming here , to be made dull - like , if it warn’t for favours past . But favours past , Polly , is never to be forgot . To them which is in adversity , besides , your face is a cord’l . So let ’s have another kiss on it , my dear . You wish no better than to do a right act , I know ; and my views is , that it ’s right and dutiful to do this . Good - night , Polly ! ”
421716	421721	421723	421724	Miss Tox	208	“ Oh , Polly , ”
421726	421778	421723	421724	Miss Tox	208	“ when I looked in to have a little lesson with the children just now , I got the message that you left for me ; and as soon as I could recover my spirits at all , I came on after you . Is there no one here but you ? ”
421779	421786	421788	421788	Polly	218	“ Ah ! not a soul , ”
421790	421796	421798	421799	Miss Tox	208	“ Have you seen him ? ”
421801	421805	421807	421807	Polly	218	“ Bless you , ”
421809	421831	421807	421807	Polly	218	“ no ; he has not been seen this many a day . They tell me he never leaves his room . ”
421832	421840	421842	421843	Miss Tox	208	“ Is he said to be ill ? ”
421845	421856	421858	421858	Polly	218	“ No , Ma’am , not that I know of , ”
421860	421876	421858	421858	Polly	218	“ except in his mind . He must be very bad there , poor gentleman ! ”
422380	422392	422371	422371	his	1679	“ Damme , Sir , the woman ’s a born idiot ! ”
422407	422420	422421	422421	He	1679	“ Let him remember it in that room , years to come ! ”
422443	422492	422493	422493	He	1679	“ Let him remember it in that room , years to come ! The rain that falls upon the roof , the wind that mourns outside the door , may have foreknowledge in their melancholy sound . Let him remember it in that room , years to come ! ”
422541	422553	422554	422554	He	1679	“ Papa ! Papa ! Speak to me , dear Papa ! ”
425016	425049	425009	425009	her	1634	“ Papa ! Dearest Papa ! Pardon me , forgive me ! I have come back to ask forgiveness on my knees . I never can be happy more , without it ! ”
425077	425156	425157	425157	He	1679	“ Dear Papa , oh do n’t look strangely on me ! I never meant to leave you . I never thought of it , before or afterwards . I was frightened when I went away , and could not think . Papa , dear , I am changed . I am penitent . I know my fault . I know my duty better now . Papa , do n’t cast me off , or I shall die ! ”
425245	425315	425229	425229	she	9380	“ Papa , love , I am a mother . I have a child who will soon call Walter by the name by which I call you . When it was born , and when I knew how much I loved it , I knew what I had done in leaving you . Forgive me , dear Papa ! oh say God bless me , and my little child ! ”
425353	425415	425339	425339	she	9381	“ My little child was born at sea , Papa I prayed to God ( and so did Walter for me ) to spare me , that I might come home . The moment I could land , I came back to you . Never let us be parted any more , Papa . Never let us be parted any more ! ”
425444	425479	425480	425480	Her	9381	“ You will come home with me , Papa , and see my baby . A boy , Papa . His name is Paul . I think — I hope — he ’s like — ”
425485	425550	425551	425551	She	9381	“ Dear Papa , for the sake of my child , for the sake of the name we have given him , for my sake , pardon Walter . He is so kind and tender to me . I am so happy with him . It was not his fault that we were married . It was mine . I loved him so much . ”
425563	425698	425551	425551	She	9381	“ He is the darling of my heart , Papa I would die for him . He will love and honour you as I will . We will teach our little child to love and honour you ; and we will tell him , when he can understand , that you had a son of that name once , and that he died , and you were very sorry ; but that he is gone to Heaven , where we all hope to see him when our time for resting comes . Kiss me , Papa , as a promise that you will be reconciled to Walter — to my dearest husband — to the father of the little child who taught me to come back , Papa Who taught me to come back ! ”

426038	426044	426046	426046	Polly	218	“ And a good one ! ”
426048	426053	426055	426056	Miss Tox	208	“ You are right , ”
426058	426093	426095	426096	Miss Tox	208	“ and it ’s a credit to you , Polly , that you were always her friend when she was a little child . You were her friend long before I was , Polly , ”
426098	426108	426095	426096	Miss Tox	208	“ and you ’re a good creature . Robin ! ”

Now , Robin , as I am going to give you a trial , at your urgent request , as my domestic , with a view to your restoration to respectability , I will take this impressive occasion of remarking that I hope you will never forget that you have , and have always had , a good mother , and that you will endeavour so to conduct yourself as to be a comfort to her . ”

428107	428140	428104	428105	Mr Toots	664	“ I give you joy . If you ’re as — as — as perfectly blissful in a matrimonial life , as I am myself , you ’ll have nothing to desire . ”
428141	428153	428155	428156	Mr Feeder	341	“ I do n’t forget my old friends , you see , ”
428158	428168	428155	428156	Mr Feeder	341	“ I ask em to my wedding , Toots . ”

428178	428312	428314	428315	Mr Toots	664	“ the fact is , that there were several circumstances which prevented me from communicating with you until after my marriage had been solemnised . In the first place , I had made a perfect brute of myself to you , on the subject of Miss Dombey ; and I felt that if you were asked to any wedding of mine , you would naturally expect that it was with Miss Dombey , which involved explanations , that upon my word and honour , at that crisis , would have knocked me completely over . In the second place , our wedding was strictly private ; there being nobody present but one friend of myself and Mrs Toots ’s , who is a Captain in — I do n’t exactly know in what , ”
428317	428359	428314	428315	Mr Toots	664	“ but it ’s of no consequence . I hope , Feeder , that in writing a statement of what had occurred before Mrs Toots and myself went abroad upon our foreign tour , I fully discharged the offices of friendship . ”

428392	428406	428389	428390	Mr Toots	664	“ I should be glad to know what you think of my union . ”
428407	428410	428412	428413	Mr Feeder	341	“ Capital ! ”
428415	428427	428429	428430	Mr Toots	664	“ You think it ’s capital , do you , Feeder ? ”
428433	428455	428429	428430	Mr Toots	664	“ Then how capital must it be to Me ! For you can never know what an extraordinary woman that is . ”
428482	428486	428488	428489	Mr Toots	664	“ You see , ”
428491	428522	428488	428489	Mr Toots	664	“ what I wanted in a wife was — in short , was sense . Money , Feeder , I had . Sense I — I had not , particularly . ”
428527	428537	428523	428524	Mr Feeder	341	“ Oh , yes , you had , Toots ! ”
428543	428569	428571	428572	Mr Toots	664	“ No , Feeder , I had not . Why should I disguise it ? I had not . I knew that sense was There , ”
428582	428646	428648	428649	Mr Toots	664	“ in perfect heaps . I had no relation to object or be offended , on the score of station ; for I had no relation . I have never had anybody belonging to me but my guardian , and him , Feeder , I have always considered as a Pirate and a Corsair . Therefore , you know it was not likely , ”
428651	428659	428648	428649	Mr Toots	664	“ that I should take his opinion . ”
428660	428663	428665	428666	Mr Feeder	341	“ No , ”
428668	428671	428673	428674	Mr Toots	664	“ Accordingly , ”
428676	428742	428744	428745	Mr Toots	664	“ I acted on my own . Bright was the day on which I did so ! Feeder ! Nobody but myself can tell what the capacity of that woman ’s mind is . If ever the Rights of Women , and all that kind of thing , are properly attended to , it will be through her powerful intellect — Susan , my dear ! ”
428753	428760	428838	428839	Mrs Blimber	339	“ pray do not exert yourself ! ”

429702	429708	429710	429711	Mr Toots	664	“ Why , my love , ”
429713	429733	429710	429711	Mr Toots	664	“ it ’s from Captain Gills . Do not excite yourself . Walters and Miss Dombey are expected home ! ”

429753	429780	429744	429744	herself	664	“ do n’t try to deceive me , for it ’s no use , they ’re come home — I see it plainly in your face ! ”
429781	429789	429791	429792	Mr Toots	664	“ She ’s a most extraordinary woman ! ”
429798	429824	429791	429792	Mr Toots	664	“ You ’re perfectly right , my love , they have come home . Miss Dombey has seen her father , and they are reconciled ! ”
429825	429828	429830	429831	Mrs Toots	664	“ Reconciled ! ”
429837	429841	429843	429844	Mr Toots	664	“ My dear , ”
429846	429930	429843	429844	Mr Toots	664	“ pray do not exert yourself . Do remember the medical man ! Captain Gills says — at least he do n’t say , but I imagine , from what I can make out , he means — that Miss Dombey has brought her unfortunate father away from his old house , to one where she and Walters are living ; that he is lying very ill there — supposed to be dying ; and that she attends upon him night and day . ”
429939	429944	429946	429947	Mr Toots	664	“ My dearest Susan , ”
429949	429980	429946	429947	Mr Toots	664	“ do , do , if you possibly can , remember the medical man ! If you ca n’t , it ’s of no consequence — but do endeavour to ! ”
430686	430692	430694	430695	Mrs MacStinger	320	“ Well , Cap’en Cuttle ! ”
430697	430738	430694	430695	Mrs MacStinger	320	“ This is indeed a meeting ! I bear no malice now , Cap’en Cuttle — you need n’t fear that I ’m a going to cast any reflections . I hope to go to the altar in another spirit . ”
430766	430768	430751	430751	her	320	“ My “
430774	430831	430751	430751	her	320	” The abject Bunsby looked neither to the right nor to the left , nor at his bride , nor at his friend , but straight before him at nothing . The Captain putting out his hand , Bunsby put out his ; but , in answer to the Captain ’s greeting , spake no word . “
430835	430840	430832	430833	Cap’en Cuttle	394	” said Mrs MacStinger , “
430861	430872	430832	430833	Cap’en Cuttle	394	“ usband , as a single person , we should be “
430886	430901	430882	430883	a lady	935	” said Mrs MacStinger , turning round to the more intrepid of the two , “
430916	431048	431049	431049	I	0	” The short gentleman in the tall hat , who it appeared was the husband of the other lady , and who evidently exulted at the reduction of a fellow creature to his own condition , gave place at this , and resigned the lady to Captain Cuttle . The lady immediately seized him , and , observing that there was no time to lose , gave the word , in a strong voice , to advance . The Captain ’s concern for his friend , not unmingled , at first , with some concern for himself — for a shadowy terror that he might be married by violence , possessed him , until his knowledge of the service came to his relief , and remembering the legal obligation of saying , “
431052	431072	431049	431049	I	0	” he felt himself personally safe so long as he resolved , if asked any question , distinctly to reply “
431074	431511	431049	431049	I	0	won’t”—threw him into a profuse perspiration ; and rendered him , for a time , insensible to the movements of the procession , of which he now formed a feature , and to the conversation of his fair companion . But as he became less agitated , he learnt from this lady that she was the widow of a Mr Bokum , who had held an employment in the Custom House ; that she was the dearest friend of Mrs MacStinger , whom she considered a pattern for her sex ; that she had often heard of the Captain , and now hoped he had repented of his past life ; that she trusted Mr Bunsby knew what a blessing he had gained , but that she feared men seldom did know what such blessings were , until they had lost them ; with more to the same purpose . All this time , the Captain could not but observe that Mrs Bokum kept her eyes steadily on the bridegroom , and that whenever they came near a court or other narrow turning which appeared favourable for flight , she was on the alert to cut him off if he attempted escape . The other lady , too , as well as her husband , the short gentleman with the tall hat , were plainly on guard , according to a preconcerted plan ; and the wretched man was so secured by Mrs MacStinger , that any effort at self - preservation by flight was rendered futile . This , indeed , was apparent to the mere populace , who expressed their perception of the fact by jeers and cries ; to all of which , the dread MacStinger was inflexibly indifferent , while Bunsby himself appeared in a state of unconsciousness . The Captain made many attempts to accost the philosopher , if only in a monosyllable or a signal ; but always failed , in consequence of the vigilance of the guard , and the difficulty , at all times peculiar to Bunsby ’s constitution , of having his attention aroused by any outward and visible sign whatever . Thus they approached the chapel , a neat whitewashed edifice , recently engaged by the Reverend Melchisedech Howler , who had consented , on very urgent solicitation , to give the world another two years of existence , but had informed his followers that , then , it must positively go . While the Reverend Melchisedech was offering up some extemporary orisons , the Captain found an opportunity of growling in the bridegroom ’s ear : “
431521	431545	431049	431049	I	0	” To which Bunsby replied , with a forgetfulness of the Reverend Melchisedech , which nothing but his desperate circumstances could have excused : “
431551	431552	431049	431049	I	0	” “
431556	431561	431049	431049	I	0	” whispered the Captain , “
431574	431578	431563	431563	you	217	” Mr Bunsby answered “
431581	431582	431563	431563	you	217	” “
431594	431627	431585	431585	you	217	” inquired the Captain , not unnaturally . Bunsby , still looking , and always looking with an immovable countenance , at the opposite side of the world , made no reply . “
431633	431638	431585	431585	you	217	” said the Captain . “
431641	431652	431585	431585	you	217	” whispered Bunsby , with a momentary gleam of hope . “
431656	431661	431585	431585	you	217	” said the Captain . “
431667	431673	431674	431674	She	9527	” retorted the forlorn sage . “
431680	431681	431674	431674	She	9527	” “
431684	431689	431674	431674	She	9527	” replied the Captain . “
431706	431725	431703	431704	Jack Bunsby	217	” Jack Bunsby , however , instead of profiting by the advice , said in a doleful whisper : “
431748	431749	431739	431739	I	0	” “
431753	431758	431759	431759	I	0	” faltered the Captain , “
431787	431796	431776	431785	A man as has got such opinions as you have	9530	” Mr Bunsby merely uttered a suppressed groan . “
431799	431810	431776	431785	A man as has got such opinions as you have	9530	” said the Captain , nudging him with his elbow , “
431842	431847	431848	431848	Bunsby	559	” Bunsby was immovable . “
431850	431855	431857	431857	you	559	” whispered the Captain , “
431860	431866	431867	431867	Bunsby	559	” Bunsby would n’t twice . “
431869	431874	431881	431881	you	559	” urged the Captain , “
431889	432781	431881	431881	you	559	” Bunsby did n’t then , and did n’t ever ; for Mrs MacStinger immediately afterwards married him . One of the most frightful circumstances of the ceremony to the Captain , was the deadly interest exhibited therein by Juliana MacStinger ; and the fatal concentration of her faculties , with which that promising child , already the image of her parent , observed the whole proceedings . The Captain saw in this a succession of man - traps stretching out infinitely ; a series of ages of oppression and coercion , through which the seafaring line was doomed . It was a more memorable sight than the unflinching steadiness of Mrs Bokum and the other lady , the exultation of the short gentleman in the tall hat , or even the fell inflexibility of Mrs MacStinger . The Master MacStingers understood little of what was going on , and cared less ; being chiefly engaged , during the ceremony , in treading on one another ’s half - boots ; but the contrast afforded by those wretched infants only set off and adorned the precocious woman in Juliana . Another year or two , the Captain thought , and to lodge where that child was , would be destruction . The ceremony was concluded by a general spring of the young family on Mr Bunsby , whom they hailed by the endearing name of father , and from whom they solicited half - pence . These gushes of affection over , the procession was about to issue forth again , when it was delayed for some little time by an unexpected transport on the part of Alexander MacStinger . That dear child , it seemed , connecting a chapel with tombstones , when it was entered for any purpose apart from the ordinary religious exercises , could not be persuaded but that his mother was now to be decently interred , and lost to him for ever . In the anguish of this conviction , he screamed with astonishing force , and turned black in the face . However touching these marks of a tender disposition were to his mother , it was not in the character of that remarkable woman to permit her recognition of them to degenerate into weakness . Therefore , after vainly endeavouring to convince his reason by shakes , pokes , bawlings - out , and similar applications to his head , she led him into the air , and tried another method ; which was manifested to the marriage party by a quick succession of sharp sounds , resembling applause , and subsequently , by their seeing Alexander in contact with the coolest paving - stone in the court , greatly flushed , and loudly lamenting . The procession being then in a condition to form itself once more , and repair to Brig Place , where a marriage feast was in readiness , returned as it had come ; not without the receipt , by Bunsby , of many humorous congratulations from the populace on his recently - acquired happiness . The Captain accompanied it as far as the house - door , but , being made uneasy by the gentler manner of Mrs Bokum , who , now that she was relieved from her engrossing duty — for the watchfulness and alacrity of the ladies sensibly diminished when the bridegroom was safely married — had greater leisure to show an interest in his behalf , there left it and the captive ; faintly pleading an appointment , and promising to return presently . The Captain had another cause for uneasiness , in remorsefully reflecting that he had been the first means of Bunsby ’s entrapment , though certainly without intending it , and through his unbounded faith in the resources of that philosopher . To go back to old Sol Gills at the wooden Midshipman ’s , and not first go round to ask how Mr Dombey was — albeit the house where he lay was out of London , and away on the borders of a fresh heath — was quite out of the Captain ’s course . So he got a lift when he was tired , and made out the journey gaily . The blinds were pulled down , and the house so quiet , that the Captain was almost afraid to knock ; but listening at the door , he heard low voices within , very near it , and , knocking softly , was admitted by Mr Toots . Mr Toots and his wife had , in fact , just arrived there ; having been at the Midshipman ’s to seek him , and having there obtained the address . They were not so recently arrived , but that Mrs Toots had caught the baby from somebody , taken it in her arms , and sat down on the stairs , hugging and fondling it . Florence was stooping down beside her ; and no one could have said which Mrs Toots was hugging and fondling most , the mother or the child , or which was the tenderer , Florence of Mrs Toots , or Mrs Toots of her , or both of the baby ; it was such a little group of love and agitation . “
432795	432799	432792	432793	Miss Floy	197	” asked Susan . “
432807	432811	432800	432800	He	9969	” said Florence . “
432835	432846	432847	432847	Your	241	” said Florence , touching her clothes , in amazement . “
432862	432882	432883	432883	My	0	” Susan burst into tears , and showered kisses on the little hand that had touched her so wonderingly . “
432888	432896	432897	432897	I	0	” said Mr Toots , stepping forward , “
432981	432986	432979	432979	myself	0	” said Mr Toots , “
433035	433050	433030	433030	Susan	241	” said Mr Toots , who had spoken with great feeling and high admiration , “
433071	433255	433052	433052	I	0	” CHAPTER LXI . Relenting Florence had need of help . Her father ’s need of it was sore , and made the aid of her old friend invaluable . Death stood at his pillow . A shade , already , of what he had been , shattered in mind , and perilously sick in body , he laid his weary head down on the bed his daughter ’s hands prepared for him , and had never raised it since . She was always with him . He knew her , generally ; though , in the wandering of his brain , he often confused the circumstances under which he spoke to her . Thus he would address her , sometimes , as if his boy were newly dead ; and would tell her , that although he had said nothing of her ministering at the little bedside , yet he had seen it — he had seen it ; and then would hide his face and sob , and put out his worn hand . Sometimes he would ask her for herself . “
433260	433261	433052	433052	I	0	” “
433272	433273	433274	433274	I	0	” “
433280	433285	433274	433274	I	0	” he would cry . “
433300	433365	433294	433294	I	0	” and then a staring dread would be upon him , until she could soothe his perturbation ; and recall the tears she tried so hard , at other times , to dry . He rambled through the scenes of his old pursuits — through many where Florence lost him as she listened — sometimes for hours . He would repeat that childish question , “
433370	433721	433725	433725	Papa	242	” and ponder on it , and think about it , and reason with himself , more or less connectedly , for a good answer ; as if it had never been proposed to him until that moment . He would go on with a musing repetition of the title of his old firm twenty thousand times , and at every one of them , would turn his head upon his pillow . He would count his children — one — two — stop , and go back , and begin again in the same way . But this was when his mind was in its most distracted state . In all the other phases of its illness , and in those to which it was most constant , it always turned on Florence . What he would oftenest do was this : he would recall that night he had so recently remembered , the night on which she came down to his room , and would imagine that his heart smote him , and that he went out after her , and up the stairs to seek her . Then , confounding that time with the later days of the many footsteps , he would be amazed at their number , and begin to count them as he followed her . Here , of a sudden , was a bloody footstep going on among the others ; and after it there began to be , at intervals , doors standing open , through which certain terrible pictures were seen , in mirrors , of haggard men , concealing something in their breasts . Still , among the many footsteps and the bloody footsteps here and there , was the step of Florence . Still she was going on before . Still the restless mind went , following and counting , ever farther , ever higher , as to the summit of a mighty tower that it took years to climb . One day he inquired if that were not Susan who had spoken a long while ago . Florence said “
433727	433740	433725	433725	Papa	242	” and asked him would he like to see her ? He said “
433744	433979	433725	433725	Papa	242	” And Susan , with no little trepidation , showed herself at his bedside . It seemed a great relief to him . He begged her not to go ; to understand that he forgave her what she had said ; and that she was to stay . Florence and he were very different now , he said , and very happy . Let her look at this ! He meant his drawing the gentle head down to his pillow , and laying it beside him . He remained like this for days and weeks . At length , lying , the faint feeble semblance of a man , upon his bed , and speaking in a voice so low that they could only hear him by listening very near to his lips , he became quiet . It was dimly pleasant to him now , to lie there , with the window open , looking out at the summer sky and the trees : and , in the evening , at the sunset . To watch the shadows of the clouds and leaves , and seem to feel a sympathy with shadows . It was natural that he should . To him , life and the world were nothing else . He began to show now that he thought of Florence ’s fatigue : and often taxed his weakness to whisper to her , “
433998	434269	434270	434271	My dear	9729	” One time when Walter was in his room , he beckoned him to come near , and to stoop down ; and pressing his hand , whispered an assurance to him that he knew he could trust him with his child when he was dead . It chanced one evening , towards sunset , when Florence and Walter were sitting in his room together , as he liked to see them , that Florence , having her baby in her arms , began in a low voice to sing to the little fellow , and sang the old tune she had so often sung to the dead child : He could not bear it at the time ; he held up his trembling hand , imploring her to stop ; but next day he asked her to repeat it , and to do so often of an evening : which she did . He listening , with his face turned away . Florence was sitting on a certain time by his window , with her work - basket between her and her old attendant , who was still her faithful companion . He had fallen into a doze . It was a beautiful evening , with two hours of light to come yet ; and the tranquillity and quiet made Florence very thoughtful . She was lost to everything for the moment , but the occasion when the so altered figure on the bed had first presented her to her beautiful Mama ; when a touch from Walter leaning on the back of her chair , made her start . “
434273	434277	434270	434271	My dear	9729	” said Walter , “
434289	434304	434280	434281	someone downstairs	9549	” She fancied Walter looked grave , and asked him if anything had happened . “
434312	434316	434280	434281	someone downstairs	9549	” said Walter . “
434337	434457	434458	434458	I	0	” Florence put her arm through his ; and confiding her father to the black - eyed Mrs Toots , who sat as brisk and smart at her work as black - eyed woman could , accompanied her husband downstairs . In the pleasant little parlour opening on the garden , sat a gentleman , who rose to advance towards her when she came in , but turned off , by reason of some peculiarity in his legs , and was only stopped by the table . Florence then remembered Cousin Feenix , whom she had not at first recognised in the shade of the leaves . Cousin Feenix took her hand , and congratulated her upon her marriage . “
434467	434478	434463	434463	I	0	” said Cousin Feenix , sitting down as Florence sat , “
434593	434649	434650	434650	I	0	” Florence divined , from some indefinable constraint and anxiety in this gentleman ’s manner — which was always a gentleman ’s , in spite of the harmless little eccentricities that attached to it — and from Walter ’s manner no less , that something more immediately tending to some object was to follow this . “
434674	434679	434681	434681	I	0	” said Cousin Feenix , “
434840	434875	434889	434889	Gay	293	” Florence felt , more than ever , that there was something to come ; and looked earnestly for it . So earnestly , that Cousin Feenix answered , as if she had spoken . “
434880	434885	434889	434889	Gay	293	” said Cousin Feenix , “
435296	435322	435323	435323	My	0	” This postponement of the point , put Florence in a flutter ; and she looked from Cousin Feenix to Walter , in increasing agitation . “
435326	435330	435323	435323	My	0	” said Walter , “
435337	435338	435323	435323	My	0	” “
435349	435354	435356	435356	I	0	” said Cousin Feenix ; “
435435	435461	435418	435418	he	293	” said Cousin Feenix . Walter thus appealed to , and appealed to no less in the look that Florence turned towards him , said : “
435486	435487	435479	435480	this gentleman	848	” “
435500	435505	435491	435491	Gay	293	” interrupted Cousin Feenix . “
435517	435518	435491	435491	Gay	293	” “
435522	435533	435491	435491	Gay	293	” asked Florence , looking from one to the other . “
435539	435544	435535	435535	I	0	” said Cousin Feenix , “
435569	435570	435575	435575	Walter	293	” “
435577	435578	435575	435575	Walter	293	” “
435581	435582	435575	435575	Walter	293	” “
435588	435589	435598	435598	you	293	” “
435624	435625	435598	435598	you	293	” “
435646	435753	435754	435754	I	0	” said Florence . And rising quietly , and glancing at them with a look that was a little alarmed but perfectly confiding , left the room . When she came back , ready to bear them company , they were talking together , gravely , at the window ; and Florence could not but wonder what the topic was , that had made them so well acquainted in so short a time . She did not wonder at the look of pride and love with which her husband broke off as she entered ; for she never saw him , but that rested on her . “
435758	435763	435754	435754	I	0	” said Cousin Feenix , “
436060	436227	436228	436228	Walter	293	” Of all this , Cousin Feenix delivered himself with an obviously nervous and discomposed air . Then , giving his arm to Florence , and putting the strongest possible constraint upon his wilful legs , which seemed determined to go out into the garden , he led her to the door , and handed her into a carriage that was ready for her reception . Walter entered after him , and they drove away . Their ride was six or eight miles long . When they drove through certain dull and stately streets , lying westward in London , it was growing dusk . Florence had , by this time , put her hand in Walter ’s ; and was looking very earnestly , and with increasing agitation , into every new street into which they turned . When the carriage stopped , at last , before that house in Brook Street , where her father ’s unhappy marriage had been celebrated , Florence said , “
436238	436285	436287	436287	you	293	” Walter cheering her , and not replying , she glanced up at the house - front , and saw that all the windows were shut , as if it were uninhabited . Cousin Feenix had by this time alighted , and was offering his hand . “
436293	436294	436287	436287	you	293	” “
436314	436315	436312	436312	Florence	197	” “
436335	436514	436327	436327	I	0	” The door was softly opened , without any knock , and Cousin Feenix led her out of the summer evening air into the close dull house . More sombre and brown than ever , it seemed to have been shut up from the wedding - day , and to have hoarded darkness and sadness ever since . Florence ascended the dusky staircase , trembling ; and stopped , with her conductor , at the drawing - room door . He opened it , without speaking , and signed an entreaty to her to advance into the inner room , while he remained there . Florence , after hesitating an instant , complied . Sitting by the window at a table , where she seemed to have been writing or drawing , was a lady , whose head , turned away towards the dying light , was resting on her hand . Florence advancing , doubtfully , all at once stood still , as if she had lost the power of motion . The lady turned her head . “
436518	436522	436665	436665	Mama	212	” she said , “
436527	436528	436665	436665	Mama	212	” “
436533	436553	436554	436554	Mama	212	” cried Florence , shrinking back as she rose up and putting out her hands to keep her off . “
436556	436662	436554	436554	Mama	212	” They stood looking at each other . Passion and pride had worn it , but it was the face of Edith , and beautiful and stately yet . It was the face of Florence , and through all the terrified avoidance it expressed , there was pity in it , sorrow , a grateful tender memory . On each face , wonder and fear were painted vividly ; each so still and silent , looking at the other over the black gulf of the irrevocable past . Florence was the first to change . Bursting into tears , she said from her full heart , “
436697	436715	436678	436678	you	212	” Edith stood before her , dumb and motionless . Her eyes were fixed upon her face . “
436723	436727	436678	436678	you	212	” said Florence , “
436747	436795	436796	436796	She	9613	” any more . If you would have me ask his pardon , I will do it , Mama . I am almost sure he will grant it now , if I ask him . May Heaven grant it to you , too , and comfort you ! ”
436802	436817	436819	436819	Florence	197	“ Walter — I am married to him , and we have a son , ”
436821	436846	436848	436848	Florence	197	timidly—“is at the door , and has brought me here . I will tell him that you are repentant ; that you are changed , ”
436855	436878	436848	436848	Florence	197	“ and he will speak to Papa with me , I know . Is there anything but this that I can do ? ”
436894	436919	436879	436879	Edith	481	“ The stain upon your name , upon your husband ’s , on your child ’s . Will that ever be forgiven , Florence ? ”
436920	436968	436970	436970	Florence	197	“ Will it ever be , Mama ? It is ! Freely , freely , both by Walter and by me . If that is any consolation to you , there is nothing that you may believe more certainly . You do not — you do not , ”
436972	436998	436999	436999	She	197	“ speak of Papa ; but I am sure you wish that I should ask him for his forgiveness . I am sure you do . ”
437005	437009	437011	437011	Florence	197	“ I will ! ”
437013	437054	437056	437056	Florence	197	“ I will bring it you , if you will let me ; and then , perhaps , we may take leave of each other , more like what we used to be to one another . I have not , ”
437066	437136	437138	437138	Florence	197	“ I have not shrunk back from you , Mama , because I fear you , or because I dread to be disgraced by you . I only wish to do my duty to Papa . I am very dear to him , and he is very dear to me . But I never can forget that you were very good to me . Oh , pray to Heaven , ”
437145	437188	437189	437189	Edith	481	“ pray to Heaven , Mama , to forgive you all this sin and shame , and to forgive me if I can not help doing this ( if it is wrong ) , when I remember what you used to be ! ”
437212	437215	437216	437216	she	481	“ Florence ! ”
437219	437250	437216	437216	she	481	“ My better angel ! Before I am mad again , before my stubbornness comes back and strikes me dumb , believe me , upon my soul I am innocent ! ”
437251	437254	437189	437189	Edith	481	“ Mama ! ”
437255	437335	437216	437216	she	481	“ Guilty of much ! Guilty of that which sets a waste between us evermore . Guilty of what must separate me , through the whole remainder of my life , from purity and innocence — from you , of all the earth . Guilty of a blind and passionate resentment , of which I do not , can not , will not , even now , repent ; but not guilty with that dead man . Before God ! ”
437354	437357	437358	437358	she	481	“ Florence ! ”
437361	437422	437358	437358	she	481	“ purest and best of natures,—whom I love — who might have changed me long ago , and did for a time work some change even in the woman that I am,—believe me , I am innocent of that ; and once more , on my desolate heart , let me lay this dear head , for the last time ! ”
437444	437454	437455	437455	she	481	“ There is nothing else in all the world , ”
437458	437509	437455	437455	she	481	“ that would have wrung denial from me . No love , no hatred , no hope , no threat . I said that I would die , and make no sign . I could have done so , and I would , if we had never met , Florence . ”
437510	437514	437516	437517	Cousin Feenix	442	“ I trust , ”
437539	437854	437855	437855	Edith	481	“ that my lovely and accomplished relative will excuse my having , by a little stratagem , effected this meeting . I can not say that I was , at first , wholly incredulous as to the possibility of my lovely and accomplished relative having , very unfortunately , committed herself with the deceased person with white teeth ; because in point of fact , one does see , in this world — which is remarkable for devilish strange arrangements , and for being decidedly the most unintelligible thing within a man ’s experience — very odd conjunctions of that sort . But as I mentioned to my friend Dombey , I could not admit the criminality of my lovely and accomplished relative until it was perfectly established . And feeling , when the deceased person was , in point of fact , destroyed in a devilish horrible manner , that her position was a very painful one — and feeling besides that our family had been a little to blame in not paying more attention to her , and that we are a careless family — and also that my aunt , though a devilish lively woman , had perhaps not been the very best of mothers — I took the liberty of seeking her in France , and offering her such protection as a man very much out at elbows could offer . Upon which occasion , my lovely and accomplished relative did me the honour to express that she believed I was , in my way , a devilish good sort of fellow ; and that therefore she put herself under my protection . Which in point of fact I understood to be a kind thing on the part of my lovely and accomplished relative , as I am getting extremely shaky , and have derived great comfort from her solicitude . ”
437883	437890	437892	437893	Cousin Feenix	442	“ My lovely and accomplished relative , ”
437902	438178	438180	438181	Cousin Feenix	442	“ will excuse me , if , for her satisfaction , and my own , and that of my friend Dombey , whose lovely and accomplished daughter we so much admire , I complete the thread of my observations . She will remember that , from the first , she and I never alluded to the subject of her elopement . My impression , certainly , has always been , that there was a mystery in the affair which she could explain if so inclined . But my lovely and accomplished relative being a devilish resolute woman , I knew that she was not , in point of fact , to be trifled with , and therefore did not involve myself in any discussions . But , observing lately , that her accessible point did appear to be a very strong description of tenderness for the daughter of my friend Dombey , it occurred to me that if I could bring about a meeting , unexpected on both sides , it might lead to beneficial results . Therefore , we being in London , in the present private way , before going to the South of Italy , there to establish ourselves , in point of fact , until we go to our long homes , which is a devilish disagreeable reflection for a man , I applied myself to the discovery of the residence of my friend Gay — handsome man of an uncommonly frank disposition , who is probably known to my lovely and accomplished relative — and had the happiness of bringing his amiable wife to the present place . And now , ”
438201	438283	438180	438181	Cousin Feenix	442	“ I do conjure my relative , not to stop half way , but to set right , as far as she can , whatever she has done wrong — not for the honour of her family , not for her own fame , not for any of those considerations which unfortunate circumstances have induced her to regard as hollow , and in point of fact , as approaching to humbug — but because it is wrong , and not right . ”
438331	438340	438341	438341	she	481	“ I debated with myself a long time , ”
438348	438400	438341	438341	she	481	“ whether to write this at all , in case of dying suddenly or by accident , and feeling the want of it upon me . I have deliberated , ever since , when and how to destroy it . Take it , Florence . The truth is written in it . ”
438401	438407	438409	438409	Florence	197	“ Is it for Papa ? ”
438411	438419	438420	438420	she	197	“ It is for whom you will , ”
438423	438444	438341	438341	she	481	“ It is given to you , and is obtained by you . He never could have had it otherwise . ”
438455	438458	438460	438460	Florence	197	“ Mama , ”
438462	438499	438460	438460	Florence	197	“ he has lost his fortune ; he has been at the point of death ; he may not recover , even now . Is there any word that I shall say to him from you ? ”
438500	438506	438508	438508	Edith	481	“ Did you tell me , ”
438510	438519	438508	438508	Edith	481	“ that you were very dear to him ? ”
438520	438523	438525	438525	Florence	197	“ Yes ! ”
438532	438543	438525	438525	Florence	197	“ Tell him I am sorry that we ever met . ”
438544	438548	438550	438550	Florence	197	“ No more ? ”
438555	438600	438601	438601	She	197	“ Tell him , if he asks , that I do not repent of what I have done — not yet — for if it were to do again to - morrow , I should do it . But if he is a changed man—- ”
438619	438647	438612	438612	Florence	197	“ — But that being a changed man , he knows , now , it would never be . Tell him I wish it never had been . ”
438648	438653	438655	438655	Florence	197	“ May I say , ”
438657	438670	438655	438655	Florence	197	“ that you grieved to hear of the afflictions he has suffered ? ”
438671	438674	438675	438675	she	197	“ Not , ”
438678	438713	438675	438675	she	197	“ if they have taught him that his daughter is very dear to him . He will not grieve for them himself , one day , if they have brought that lesson , Florence . ”
438714	438733	438735	438735	Florence	197	“ You wish well to him , and would have him happy . I am sure you would ! ”
438737	438759	438735	438735	Florence	197	“ Oh ! let me be able , if I have the occasion at some future time , to say so ? ”
438804	438906	438783	438783	she	481	“ Tell him that if , in his own present , he can find any reason to compassionate my past , I sent word that I asked him to do so . Tell him that if , in his own present , he can find a reason to think less bitterly of me , I asked him to do so . Tell him , that , dead as we are to one another , never more to meet on this side of eternity , he knows there is one feeling in common between us now , that there never was before . ”
438922	438929	438930	438930	she	481	“ I trust myself to that , ”
438933	439065	438930	438930	she	481	“ for his better thoughts of me , and mine of him . When he loves his Florence most , he will hate me least . When he is most proud and happy in her and her children , he will be most repentant of his own part in the dark vision of our married life . At that time , I will be repentant too — let him know it then — and think that when I thought so much of all the causes that had made me what I was , I needed to have allowed more for the causes that had made him what he was . I will try , then , to forgive him his share of blame . Let him try to forgive me mine ! ”
439066	439070	439072	439072	Florence	197	“ Oh Mama ! ”
439074	439094	439072	439072	Florence	197	“ How it lightens my heart , even in such a strange meeting and parting , to hear this ! ”
439095	439103	439105	439105	Edith	481	“ Strange words in my own ears , ”
439107	439205	439206	439206	She	9618	“ and foreign to the sound of my own voice ! But even if I had been the wretched creature I have given him occasion to believe me , I think I could have said them still , hearing that you and he were very dear to one another . Let him , when you are dearest , ever feel that he is most forbearing in his thoughts of me — that I am most forbearing in my thoughts of him ! Those are the last words I send him ! Now , goodbye , my life ! ”
439230	439257	439206	439206	She	9618	“ This kiss for your child ! These kisses for a blessing on your head ! My own dear Florence , my sweet girl , farewell ! ”
439258	439263	439265	439265	Florence	197	“ To meet again ! ”
439267	439306	439265	439265	Florence	197	“ Never again ! Never again ! When you leave me in this dark room , think that you have left me in the grave . Remember only that I was once , and that I loved you ! ”
439358	439364	439366	439367	Cousin Feenix	442	“ I am devilish sorry , ”
439387	439634	439366	439367	Cousin Feenix	442	“ that the lovely and accomplished daughter of my friend Dombey and amiable wife of my friend Gay , should have had her sensitive nature so very much distressed and cut up by the interview which is just concluded . But I hope and trust I have acted for the best , and that my honourable friend Dombey will find his mind relieved by the disclosures which have taken place . I exceedingly lament that my friend Dombey should have got himself , in point of fact , into the devil ’s own state of conglomeration by an alliance with our family ; but am strongly of opinion that if it had n’t been for the infernal scoundrel Barker — man with white teeth — everything would have gone on pretty smoothly . In regard to my relative who does me the honour to have formed an uncommonly good opinion of myself , I can assure the amiable wife of my friend Gay , that she may rely on my being , in point of fact , a father to her . And in regard to the changes of human life , and the extraordinary manner in which we are perpetually conducting ourselves , all I can say is , with my friend Shakespeare — man who was n’t for an age but for all time , and with whom my friend Gay is no doubt acquainted — that its like the shadow of a dream . ”
439690	439699	439701	439702	Mr Dombey	533	“ You are quite right , Mr Gills , ”
439704	439715	439701	439702	Mr Dombey	533	“ This is a very rare and most delicious wine . ”
439741	439749	439751	439752	Mr Gills	248	“ We always promised ourselves , Sir , ”
439754	439762	439751	439752	Mr Gills	248	” Ned and myself , I mean — ”
439779	439831	439763	439764	Mr Dombey	533	“ — that we would drink this , one day or other , to Walter safe at home : though such a home we never thought of . If you do n’t object to our old whim , Sir , let us devote this first glass to Walter and his wife . ”
439832	439839	439841	439842	Mr Dombey	533	“ To Walter and his wife ! ”
439844	439848	439841	439842	Mr Dombey	533	“ Florence , my child”—and
439854	439861	439863	439864	Mr Toots	664	“ To Walter and his wife ! ”
439866	439868	439863	439864	Mr Toots	664	“ To Wal”r
439873	439878	439863	439864	Mr Toots	664	” exclaims the Captain . “
439881	440648	440649	440650	Ed’ard Cuttle	531	” and the Captain exhibiting a strong desire to clink his glass against some other glass , Mr Dombey , with a ready hand , holds out his . The others follow ; and there is a blithe and merry ringing , as of a little peal of marriage bells . Other buried wine grows older , as the old Madeira did in its time ; and dust and cobwebs thicken on the bottles . Mr Dombey is a white - haired gentleman , whose face bears heavy marks of care and suffering ; but they are traces of a storm that has passed on for ever , and left a clear evening in its track . Ambitious projects trouble him no more . His only pride is in his daughter and her husband . He has a silent , thoughtful , quiet manner , and is always with his daughter . Miss Tox is not infrequently of the family party , and is quite devoted to it , and a great favourite . Her admiration of her once stately patron is , and has been ever since the morning of her shock in Princess ’s Place , platonic , but not weakened in the least . Nothing has drifted to him from the wreck of his fortunes , but a certain annual sum that comes he knows not how , with an earnest entreaty that he will not seek to discover , and with the assurance that it is a debt , and an act of reparation . He has consulted with his old clerk about this , who is clear it may be honourably accepted , and has no doubt it arises out of some forgotten transaction in the times of the old House . That hazel - eyed bachelor , a bachelor no more , is married now , and to the sister of the grey - haired Junior . He visits his old chief sometimes , but seldom . There is a reason in the greyhaired Junior ’s history , and yet a stronger reason in his name , why he should keep retired from his old employer ; and as he lives with his sister and her husband , they participate in that retirement . Walter sees them sometimes — Florence too — and the pleasant house resounds with profound duets arranged for the Piano - Forte and Violoncello , and with the labours of Harmonious Blacksmiths . And how goes the wooden Midshipman in these changed days ? Why , here he still is , right leg foremost , hard at work upon the hackney coaches , and more on the alert than ever , being newly painted from his cocked hat to his buckled shoes ; and up above him , in golden characters , these names shine refulgent , GILLS AND CUTTLE . Not another stroke of business does the Midshipman achieve beyond his usual easy trade . But they do say , in a circuit of some half - mile round the blue umbrella in Leadenhall Market , that some of Mr Gills ’s old investments are coming out wonderfully well ; and that instead of being behind the time in those respects , as he supposed , he was , in truth , a little before it , and had to wait the fulness of the time and the design . The whisper is that Mr Gills ’s money has begun to turn itself , and that it is turning itself over and over pretty briskly . Certain it is that , standing at his shop - door , in his coffee - coloured suit , with his chronometer in his pocket , and his spectacles on his forehead , he do n’t appear to break his heart at customers not coming , but looks very jovial and contented , though full as misty as of yore . As to his partner , Captain Cuttle , there is a fiction of a business in the Captain ’s mind which is better than any reality . The Captain is as satisfied of the Midshipman ’s importance to the commerce and navigation of the country , as he could possibly be , if no ship left the Port of London without the Midshipman ’s assistance . His delight in his own name over the door , is inexhaustible . He crosses the street , twenty times a day , to look at it from the other side of the way ; and invariably says , on these occasions , “
440687	440717	440718	440719	Captain Gills	527	” But here is Mr Toots descending on the Midshipman with violent rapidity , and Mr Toots ’s face is very red as he bursts into the little parlour . “
440721	440726	440718	440719	Captain Gills	527	” says Mr Toots , “
440748	440749	440738	440739	Mrs Toots	664	” “
440756	440761	440762	440762	I	0	” cries the Captain . “
440770	440775	440762	440762	I	0	” says old Sol . “
440778	440783	440776	440776	Thank’ee	406	” chuckles Mr Toots , “
440833	440834	440835	440837	A female stranger	9635	” “
440839	440844	440835	440837	A female stranger	9635	” inquires the Captain . “
440850	440855	440847	440848	Captain Gills	527	” says Mr Toots , “
440880	440881	440847	440848	Captain Gills	527	” “
440885	440922	440847	440848	Captain Gills	527	” says the Captain , turning to the old case - bottle with no throat — for it is evening , and the Midshipman ’s usual moderate provision of pipes and glasses is on the board . “
440937	440938	440847	440848	Captain Gills	527	” “
440944	440951	440952	440952	I	0	” says the delighted Mr Toots . “
440986	441006	440978	440978	I	0	” Mr Toots begins to smoke , accordingly , and in the openness of his heart is very loquacious . “
441029	441034	441046	441046	she	9638	” said Mr Toots , “
441055	441061	441046	441046	she	9638	” Both his auditors assent . “
441066	441071	441063	441063	you	639	” says Mr Toots , “
441136	441137	441133	441134	Captain Gills	527	” “
441145	441150	441133	441134	Captain Gills	527	” says the Captain , “
441166	441167	441133	441134	Captain Gills	527	” “
441177	441186	441174	441175	Captain Gills	527	” says Mr Toots , with great earnestness ; “
441212	441234	441199	441199	I	0	” The Captain approves of this figure greatly ; and murmurs that no flower as blows , is like the rose . “
441240	441245	441246	441246	she	9644	” pursues Mr Toots , “
441384	441385	441378	441378	I	0	” “
441391	441396	441399	441399	I	0	” says the Captain . “
441401	441406	441399	441399	I	0	” says Sol Gills . “
441409	441433	441399	441399	I	0	” resumes Mr Toots , after some contemplative pulling at his pipe , during which his visage has expressed the most contented reflection , “
441544	441545	441541	441542	Mr Sols	639	” “
441549	441561	441541	441542	Mr Sols	639	” says the old Instrument - maker , rubbing his hands . “
441641	441642	441635	441636	My wife	3574	” “
441664	441671	441675	441676	Mr Toots	664	” returns old Sol , laughing . “
441684	441685	441710	441713	that most remarkable woman	9670	” “
441689	441694	441710	441713	that most remarkable woman	9670	” says Mr Toots . “
441782	441789	441777	441778	Mrs Toots	664	” says Mr Toots exultingly , ‘ “
441867	441933	441934	441935	Sol Gills	248	” Mr Toots , with the assistance of his pipe — which he is extremely glad to devote to oratorical purposes , as its proper use affects him with a very uncomfortable sensation — does such grand justice to this prophetic sentence of his wife ’s , that the Captain , throwing away his glazed hat in a state of the greatest excitement , cries : “
441950	442001	441934	441935	Sol Gills	248	Wal”r to overhaul on that there night when he first took to business ? Was it this here quotation , ‘ Turn again Whittington , Lord Mayor of London , and when you are old you will never depart from it . ’ Was it them words , Sol Gills ? ”
442002	442009	442011	442015	the old Instrument - maker	4335	“ It certainly was , Ned , ”
442017	442022	442011	442015	the old Instrument - maker	4335	“ I remember well . ”
442023	442030	442032	442033	the Captain	10100	“ Then I tell you what , ”
442050	442072	442032	442033	the Captain	10100	“ I ’ll give you Lovely Peg right through ; and stand by , both on you , for the chorus ! ”
442241	442256	442237	442238	the child	716	“ What , grandpa ! Am I so like my poor little Uncle again ? ”
442257	442273	442237	442238	the child	716	“ Yes , Paul . But he was weak , and you are very strong . ”
442274	442283	442313	442317	the white - haired gentleman	9688	“ Oh yes , I am very strong . ”
442284	442302	442237	442238	the child	716	“ And he lay on a little bed beside the sea , and you can run about . ”
442485	442498	442478	442479	The child	716	“ Dear grandpapa , why do you cry when you kiss me ? ”
442503	442510	442499	442499	He	9688	“ Little Florence ! little Florence ! ”
