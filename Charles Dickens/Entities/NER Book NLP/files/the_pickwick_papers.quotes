111	142	144	145	this Association	770	‘ May 12 , 1827 . Joseph Smiggers , Esq . , P.V.P.M.P.C. [ Perpetual Vice- President -- Member Pickwick Club ] , presiding . The following resolutions unanimously agreed to:-- ‘
226	338	214	215	Samuel Pickwick	240	‘ That while this Association is deeply sensible of the advantages which must accrue to the cause of science , from the production to which they have just adverted -- no less than from the unwearied researches of Samuel Pickwick , Esq . , G.C.M.P.C. , in Hornsey , Highgate , Brixton , and Camberwell -- they can not but entertain a lively sense of the inestimable benefits which must inevitably result from carrying the speculations of that learned man into a wider field , from extending his travels , and , consequently , enlarging his sphere of observation , to the advancement of knowledge , and the diffusion of learning . ‘
399	414	461	461	M.P.C.	781	‘ That the said proposal has received the sanction and approval of this Association . ‘
535	586	625	626	this Association	770	‘ That this Association cordially recognises the principle of every member of the Corresponding Society defraying his own travelling expenses ; and that it sees no objection whatever to the members of the said society pursuing their inquiries for any length of time they please , upon the same terms . ‘
654	834	835	835	Pickwick	240	’ A casual observer , adds the secretary , to whose notes we are indebted for the following account -- a casual observer might possibly have remarked nothing extraordinary in the bald head , and circular spectacles , which were intently turned towards his ( the secretary ’s ) face , during the reading of the above resolutions : to those who knew that the gigantic brain of Pickwick was working beneath that forehead , and that the beaming eyes of Pickwick were twinkling behind those glasses , the sight was indeed an interesting one . There sat the man who had traced to their source the mighty ponds of Hampstead , and agitated the scientific world with his Theory of Tittlebats , as calm and unmoved as the deep waters of the one on a frosty day , or as a solitary specimen of the other in the inmost recesses of an earthen jar . And how much more interesting did the spectacle become , when , starting into full life and animation , as a simultaneous call for ‘
836	1218	1219	1220	Mr. Pickwick	240	’ burst from his followers , that illustrious man slowly mounted into the Windsor chair , on which he had been previously seated , and addressed the club himself had founded . What a study for an artist did that exciting scene present ! The eloquent Pickwick , with one hand gracefully concealed behind his coat tails , and the other waving in air to assist his glowing declamation ; his elevated position revealing those tights and gaiters , which , had they clothed an ordinary man , might have passed without observation , but which , when Pickwick clothed them -- if we may use the expression -- inspired involuntary awe and respect ; surrounded by the men who had volunteered to share the perils of his travels , and who were destined to participate in the glories of his discoveries . On his right sat Mr. Tracy Tupman -- the too susceptible Tupman , who to the wisdom and experience of maturer years superadded the enthusiasm and ardour of a boy in the most interesting and pardonable of human weaknesses -- love . Time and feeding had expanded that once romantic form ; the black silk waistcoat had become more and more developed ; inch by inch had the gold watch - chain beneath it disappeared from within the range of Tupman ’s vision ; and gradually had the capacious chin encroached upon the borders of the white cravat : but the soul of Tupman had known no change-- admiration of the fair sex was still its ruling passion . On the left of his great leader sat the poetic Snodgrass , and near him again the sporting Winkle ; the former poetically enveloped in a mysterious blue cloak with a canine - skin collar , and the latter communicating additional lustre to a new green shooting - coat , plaid neckerchief , and closely- fitted drabs . Mr. Pickwick ’s oration upon this occasion , together with the debate thereon , is entered on the Transactions of the Club . Both bear a strong affinity to the discussions of other celebrated bodies ; and , as it is always interesting to trace a resemblance between the proceedings of great men , we transfer the entry to these pages . ‘
1722	1774	1775	1777	MR . PICKWICK	240	‘ MR . BLOTTON ( of Aldgate ) rose to order . Did the honourable Pickwickian allude to him ? ( Cries of “ Order , ” “ Chair , ” “ Yes , ” “ No , ” “ Go on , ” “ Leave off , ” etc . ) ‘
1802	1861	1789	1789	He	240	‘ MR . BLOTTON would only say then , that he repelled the hon . gent . ’s false and scurrilous accusation , with profound contempt . ( Great cheering . ) The hon . gent . was a humbug . ( Immense confusion , and loud cries of “ Chair , ” and “ Order . ” ) ‘
1906	1927	1943	1943	he	246	‘ The CHAIRMAN was quite sure the hon . Pickwickian would withdraw the expression he had just made use of . ‘
1947	1978	1988	1988	he	246	‘ The CHAIRMAN felt it his imperative duty to demand of the honourable gentleman , whether he had used the expression which had just escaped him in a common sense . ‘
2049	2097	2029	2029	he	246	‘ MR . PICKWICK felt much gratified by the fair , candid , and full explanation of his honourable friend . He begged it to be at once understood , that his own observations had been merely intended to bear a Pickwickian construction . ( Cheers . ) ’
2176	2183	2187	2187	THEIR	818	’S JOURNEY , AND THE FIRST EVENING ’S
2295	2298	2300	2301	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Such , ’
2303	2363	2300	2301	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ are the narrow views of those philosophers who , content with examining the things that lie before them , look not to the truths which are hidden beyond . As well might I be content to gaze on Goswell Street for ever , without one effort to penetrate to the hidden countries which on every side surround it . ’
2478	2481	2483	2484	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Cab ! ’
2486	2493	2483	2484	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Here you are , sir , ’
2543	2557	2540	2541	the waterman	825	‘ Here you are , sir . Now , then , fust cab ! ’
2590	2594	2596	2597	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Golden Cross , ’
2599	2608	2610	2611	the driver	829	‘ Only a bob ’s vorth , Tommy , ’
2629	2639	2641	2642	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ How old is that horse , my friend ? ’
2657	2662	2664	2665	the driver	829	‘ Forty - two , ’
2671	2674	2676	2677	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ What ! ’
2720	2733	2735	2736	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ And how long do you keep him out at a time ? ’
2743	2749	2751	2752	the man	835	‘ Two or three veeks , ’
2754	2757	2759	2760	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Weeks ! ’
2773	2784	2786	2787	the driver	829	‘ He lives at Pentonwil when he ’s at home , ’
2790	2804	2786	2787	the driver	829	‘ but we seldom takes him home , on account of his weakness . ’
2805	2812	2814	2817	the perplexed Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ On account of his weakness ! ’
2819	2830	2814	2817	the perplexed Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ He always falls down when he ’s took out o ’
2834	2839	2814	2817	the perplexed Mr. Pickwick	240	’ continued the driver , ‘
2878	2907	2908	2909	Mr. Pickwick	240	’ precious large wheels on , so ven he does move , they run after him , and he must go on -- he ca n’t help it . ’
2997	3003	3005	3006	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Here ’s your fare , ’
3056	3061	3063	3064	Mr. Snodgrass	247	‘ You are mad , ’
3066	3070	3072	3073	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ Or drunk , ’
3075	3079	3081	3082	Mr. Tupman	244	‘ Or both , ’
3084	3088	3090	3093	the cab - driver	849	‘ Come on ! ’
3100	3108	3090	3093	the cab - driver	849	‘ Come on-- all four on you . ’
3109	3115	3117	3121	half a dozen hackney coachmen	850	‘ Here ’s a lark ! ’
3123	3138	3117	3121	half a dozen hackney coachmen	850	‘ Go to vork , Sam!--and they crowded with great glee round the party . ‘
3146	3155	3144	3144	Sam	240	’ inquired one gentleman in black calico sleeves . ‘
3158	3163	3166	3166	he	829	’ replied the cabman , ‘
3172	3173	3166	3166	he	829	’ ‘
3181	3188	3174	3174	I	0	’ said the astonished Mr. Pickwick . ‘
3198	3203	3191	3191	you	0	’ inquired the cabman . ‘
3210	3216	3204	3204	I	0	’ said Mr. Pickwick indignantly . ‘
3221	3233	3235	3235	anybody	851	’ continued the cab - driver , appealing to the crowd , ‘
3251	3264	3299	3300	the first	857	’ down his number , but ev’ry word he says into the bargain ’
3281	3286	3288	3289	another cabman	856	‘ Did he though ? ’
3291	3297	3299	3300	the first	857	‘ Yes , did he , ’
3302	3307	3299	3300	the first	857	‘ and then arter aggerawatin ’
3339	3453	3456	3457	an officer	860	’ and the cabman dashed his hat upon the ground , with a reckless disregard of his own private property , and knocked Mr. Pickwick ’s spectacles off , and followed up the attack with a blow on Mr. Pickwick ’s nose , and another on Mr. Pickwick ’s chest , and a third in Mr. Snodgrass ’s eye , and a fourth , by way of variety , in Mr. Tupman ’s waistcoat , and then danced into the road , and then back again to the pavement , and finally dashed the whole temporary supply of breath out of Mr. Winkle ’s body ; and all in half a dozen seconds . ‘
3459	3464	3496	3497	the crowd	9730	’ said Mr. Snodgrass . ‘
3466	3472	3474	3477	a hot - pieman	861	‘ em under the pump , ’
3479	3486	3488	3489	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ You shall smart for this , ’
3491	3494	3496	3497	the crowd	9730	‘ Informers ! ’
3499	3503	3505	3506	the cabman	9727	‘ Come on , ’
3593	3599	3601	3613	a rather tall , thin , young man , in a green coat	868	‘ What ’s the fun ? ’
3623	3626	3628	3629	the crowd	9730	‘ Informers ! ’
3632	3637	3639	3640	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ We are not , ’
3657	3667	3669	3671	the young man	872	‘ Ai n’t you , though -- ain’t you ? ’
3714	3720	3722	3722	he	9678	‘ Come along , then , ’
3820	3861	3864	3864	waiter	880	’ And with a lengthened string of similar broken sentences , delivered with extraordinary volubility , the stranger led the way to the traveller ’s waiting - room , whither he was closely followed by Mr. Pickwick and his disciples . ‘
3866	3878	3864	3864	waiter	880	’ shouted the stranger , ringing the bell with tremendous violence , ‘
3966	4305	4353	4353	his	888	’ And the stranger , without stopping to take breath , swallowed at a draught full half a pint of the reeking brandy - and - water , and flung himself into a chair with as much ease as if nothing uncommon had occurred . While his three companions were busily engaged in proffering their thanks to their new acquaintance , Mr. Pickwick had leisure to examine his costume and appearance . He was about the middle height , but the thinness of his body , and the length of his legs , gave him the appearance of being much taller . The green coat had been a smart dress garment in the days of swallow - tails , but had evidently in those times adorned a much shorter man than the stranger , for the soiled and faded sleeves scarcely reached to his wrists . It was buttoned closely up to his chin , at the imminent hazard of splitting the back ; and an old stock , without a vestige of shirt collar , ornamented his neck . His scanty black trousers displayed here and there those shiny patches which bespeak long service , and were strapped very tightly over a pair of patched and mended shoes , as if to conceal the dirty white stockings , which were nevertheless distinctly visible . His long , black hair escaped in negligent waves from beneath each side of his old pinched - up hat ; and glimpses of his bare wrists might be observed between the tops of his gloves and the cuffs of his coat sleeves . His face was thin and haggard ; but an indescribable air of jaunty impudence and perfect self - possession pervaded the whole man . Such was the individual on whom Mr. Pickwick gazed through his spectacles ( which he had fortunately recovered ) , and to whom he proceeded , when his friends had exhausted themselves , to return in chosen terms his warmest thanks for his recent assistance . ‘
4309	4320	4353	4353	his	888	’ said the stranger , cutting the address very short , ‘
4364	4381	4382	4384	the Commodore ’	9752	’ This coherent speech was interrupted by the entrance of the Rochester coachman , to announce that ‘
4384	4392	4393	4393	Commodore	253	’ was on the point of starting . ‘
4395	4403	4393	4393	Commodore	253	’ said the stranger , starting up , ‘
4440	4510	4548	4548	Sir	9716	’ and he shook his head most knowingly . Now it so happened that Mr. Pickwick and his three companions had resolved to make Rochester their first halting - place too ; and having intimated to their new - found acquaintance that they were journeying to the same city , they agreed to occupy the seat at the back of the coach , where they could all sit together . ‘
4515	4544	4548	4548	Sir	9716	’ said the stranger , assisting Mr. Pickwick on to the roof with so much precipitation as to impair the gravity of that gentleman ’s deportment very materially . ‘
4550	4555	4548	4548	Sir	9716	’ inquired the coachman . ‘
4593	4628	4548	4548	Sir	9716	’ replied the stranger , as he forced into his pocket as much as he could of the brown paper parcel , which presented most suspicious indications of containing one shirt and a handkerchief . ‘
4639	4667	4548	4548	Sir	9716	’ cried the loquacious stranger , as they came out under the low archway , which in those days formed the entrance to the coach - yard . ‘
4761	4762	4757	4757	Sir	9716	’ ‘
4767	4772	4763	4763	I	0	’ said Mr. Pickwick , ‘
4781	4782	4783	4783	Ah	904	’ ‘
4807	4808	4803	4803	Philosopher	905	’ ‘
4817	4822	4815	4815	Sir	9716	’ said Mr. Pickwick . ‘
4846	4847	4842	4842	Poet	910	’ ‘
4858	4863	4850	4851	Mr. Snodgrass	247	’ said Mr. Pickwick . ‘
4868	4873	4866	4866	I	0	’ said the stranger . ‘
4908	4909	4910	4910	You	9716	’ ‘
4920	4925	4910	4910	You	9716	’ said Mr. Snodgrass . ‘
4985	5020	4983	4983	sir	9716	’ abruptly turning to Mr. Winkle . * A remarkable instance of the prophetic force of Mr. Jingle ’s imagination ; this dialogue occurring in the year 1827 , and the Revolution in 1830 . ‘
5026	5031	5024	5024	Sir	9716	’ replied that gentleman . ‘
5042	5043	5040	5040	Sir	9716	’ ‘
5048	5053	5040	5040	Sir	9716	’ said Mr. Winkle . ‘
5148	5149	5189	5189	Sir	9716	’ ‘
5154	5159	5161	5161	you	9716	’ said Mr. Pickwick . ‘
5171	5172	5161	5161	you	9716	’ ‘
5190	5215	5189	5189	Sir	9716	’ ( to Mr. Tracy Tupman , who had been bestowing sundry anti - Pickwickian glances on a young lady by the roadside ) . ‘
5218	5223	5189	5189	Sir	9716	’ said Mr. Tupman . ‘
5249	5250	5251	5251	You	9716	’ ‘
5259	5265	5251	5251	You	9716	’ said Mr. Tracy Tupman . ‘
5271	5272	5251	5251	You	9716	’ ‘
5278	5283	5276	5276	sir	9716	’ inquired Mr. Tupman . ‘
5356	5357	5359	5362	the lady in England	934	’ ‘
5367	5385	5365	5365	sir	9716	’ inquired Mr. Tupman , on whom the description of her charms had produced a powerful impression . ‘
5392	5412	5388	5388	sir	9716	’ said the stranger , applying to his right eye the brief remnant of a very old cambric handkerchief . ‘
5426	5427	5429	5430	her father	938	’ ‘
5432	5438	5429	5430	her father	938	’ inquired the poetic Snodgrass . ‘
5443	5448	5429	5430	her father	938	’ replied the stranger . ‘
5528	5529	5531	5531	you	9716	’ ‘
5543	5551	5554	5554	Sir	9716	’ said Mr. Snodgrass , deeply affected . ‘
5565	5582	5554	5554	Sir	9716	‘ em -- strange life mine -- rather curious history -- not extraordinary , but singular . ’
5641	5645	5647	5649	Mr. Augustus Snodgrass	242	‘ Magnificent ruin ! ’
5671	5679	5647	5649	Mr. Augustus Snodgrass	242	‘ What a study for an antiquarian ! ’
5701	5707	5709	5710	the stranger	9737	‘ Ah ! fine place , ’
5712	5734	5709	5710	the stranger	9737	‘ glorious pile -- frowning walls-- tottering arches -- dark nooks -- crumbling staircases -- old cathedral too-- earthy smell -- pilgrims ’
5751	5808	5810	5811	the stranger	9737	’ boxes at theatres -- queer customers those monks -- popes , and lord treasurers , and all sorts of old fellows , with great red faces , and broken noses , turning up every day-- buff jerkins too -- match - locks -- sarcophagus -- fine place -- old legends too- -strange stories : capital ; ’
5832	5840	5842	5844	Mr. Nathaniel Winkle	276	‘ Do you remain here , Sir ? ’
5846	5915	5842	5844	Mr. Nathaniel Winkle	276	‘ Here -- not I -- but you ’d better -- good house -- nice beds -- Wright ’s next house , dear -- very dear -- half - a - crown in the bill if you look at the waiter -- charge you more if you dine at a friend ’s than they would if you dined in the coffee - room -- rum fellows -- very . ’
5959	5972	5974	5974	he	240	‘ You rendered us a very important service this morning , sir , ’
5976	5999	5974	5974	he	240	‘ will you allow us to offer a slight mark of our gratitude by begging the favour of your company at dinner ? ’
6000	6020	6028	6029	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Great pleasure -- not presume to dictate , but broiled fowl and mushrooms- -capital thing ! What time ? ’
6021	6026	6028	6029	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Let me see , ’
6036	6048	6028	6029	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ it is now nearly three . Shall we say five ? ’
6049	6054	6056	6057	the stranger	9737	‘ Suit me excellently , ’
6059	6069	6056	6057	the stranger	9737	‘ five precisely -- till then-- care of yourselves ; ’
6122	6139	6141	6142	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Evidently a traveller in many countries , and a close observer of men and things , ’
6144	6153	6155	6156	Mr. Snodgrass	242	‘ I should like to see his poem , ’
6158	6168	6170	6171	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ I should like to have seen that dog , ’
6287	6295	6297	6298	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ The principal productions of these towns , ’
6300	6422	6424	6425	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ appear to be soldiers , sailors , Jews , chalk , shrimps , officers , and dockyard men . The commodities chiefly exposed for sale in the public streets are marine stores , hard - bake , apples , flat - fish , and oysters . The streets present a lively and animated appearance , occasioned chiefly by the conviviality of the military . It is truly delightful to a philanthropic mind to see these gallant men staggering along under the influence of an overflow both of animal and ardent spirits ; more especially when we remember that the following them about , and jesting with them , affords a cheap and innocent amusement for the boy population . Nothing , ’
6427	6526	6424	6425	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ can exceed their good - humour . It was but the day before my arrival that one of them had been most grossly insulted in the house of a publican . The barmaid had positively refused to draw him any more liquor ; in return for which he had ( merely in playfulness ) drawn his bayonet , and wounded the girl in the shoulder . And yet this fine fellow was the very first to go down to the house next morning and express his readiness to overlook the matter , and forget what had occurred ! ‘
6535	6540	6424	6425	Mr. Pickwick	240	’ continues Mr. Pickwick , ‘
6601	6646	6667	6667	Sir	9716	’ Punctual to five o’clock came the stranger , and shortly afterwards the dinner . He had divested himself of his brown paper parcel , but had made no alteration in his attire , and was , if possible , more loquacious than ever . ‘
6651	6664	6665	6665	Soles	261	’ he inquired , as the waiter removed one of the covers . ‘
6669	6670	6665	6665	Soles	261	’ ‘
6707	6708	6705	6705	Sir	9716	’ ‘
6712	6760	6705	6705	Sir	9716	’ said Mr. Pickwick ; and the stranger took wine , first with him , and then with Mr. Snodgrass , and then with Mr. Tupman , and then with Mr. Winkle , and then with the whole party together , almost as rapidly as he talked . ‘
6771	6776	6769	6769	waiter	880	’ said the stranger . ‘
6796	6797	6800	6800	Sir	9716	’ ‘
6802	6807	6800	6800	Sir	9716	’ said the waiter . ‘
6812	6813	6810	6810	eh	979	’ ‘
6833	6834	6831	6831	Sir	9716	’ ‘
6848	6857	6846	6846	Sir	9716	’ inquired Mr. Tupman , with great interest . ‘
6885	6886	6883	6883	Sir	9716	’ ‘
6891	6903	6883	6883	Sir	9716	’ replied Mr. Tupman . The stranger filled , and emptied . ‘
6912	6924	6904	6904	I	0	’ said Mr. Tupman , resuming the subject of the ball , ‘
6928	6929	6904	6904	I	0	’ ‘
6937	6942	6935	6935	Sir	9716	’ interposed the waiter ; ‘
6952	7029	7034	7034	sir	9716	’ Mr. Tupman again expressed an earnest wish to be present at the festivity ; but meeting with no response in the darkened eye of Mr. Snodgrass , or the abstracted gaze of Mr. Pickwick , he applied himself with great interest to the port wine and dessert , which had just been placed on the table . The waiter withdrew , and the party were left to enjoy the cosy couple of hours succeeding dinner . ‘
7036	7041	7034	7034	sir	9716	’ said the stranger , ‘
7063	7148	7149	7149	They	993	’ and he emptied his glass , which he had filled about two minutes before , and poured out another , with the air of a man who was used to it . The wine was passed , and a fresh supply ordered . The visitor talked , the Pickwickians listened . Mr. Tupman felt every moment more disposed for the ball . Mr. Pickwick ’s countenance glowed with an expression of universal philanthropy , and Mr. Winkle and Mr. Snodgrass fell fast asleep . ‘
7150	7154	7149	7149	They	993	’re beginning upstairs , ’
7171	7188	7168	7168	they	993	’ The various sounds which found their way downstairs announced the commencement of the first quadrille . ‘

7301	7318	7320	7322	Mr. Tracy Tupman	244	‘ I should be very happy to lend you a change of apparel for the purpose , ’
7324	7334	7320	7322	Mr. Tracy Tupman	244	‘ but you are rather slim , and I am-- ’
7335	7373	7375	7376	Mr. Tupman	244	‘ Rather fat -- grown - up Bacchus -- cut the leaves -- dismounted from the tub , and adopted kersey , eh?--not double distilled , but double milled -- ha ! ha ! pass the wine . ’
7484	7493	7494	7494	he	244	‘ I was about to observe , Sir , ’
7497	7523	7494	7494	he	244	‘ that though my apparel would be too large , a suit of my friend Mr. Winkle ’s would , perhaps , fit you better . ’
7545	7550	7542	7542	he	9737	‘ Just the thing . ’
7847	7857	7859	7861	the indefatigable visitor	1015	‘ Fill your glass , and pass the wine , ’
7883	7891	7893	7894	Mr. Tupman	244	‘ Winkle ’s bedroom is inside mine , ’
7896	7956	7893	7894	Mr. Tupman	244	‘ I could n’t make him understand what I wanted , if I woke him now , but I know he has a dress- suit in a carpet bag ; and supposing you wore it to the ball , and took it off when we returned , I could replace it without troubling him at all about the matter . ’
7957	7960	7962	7963	the stranger	9737	‘ Capital , ’
7965	7994	7962	7963	the stranger	9737	‘ famous plan -- damned odd situation-- fourteen coats in the packing - cases , and obliged to wear another man’s-- very good notion , that -- very . ’

8007	8015	8017	8018	the stranger	9737	‘ Not worth while splitting a guinea , ’
8020	8044	8017	8018	the stranger	9737	‘ toss who shall pay for both -- I call ; you spin -- first time -- woman -- woman -- bewitching woman , ’
8098	8105	8107	8108	Mr. Tupman	244	‘ It ’s a new coat , ’
8123	8135	8137	8137	he	244	‘ the first that ’s been made with our club button , ’
8141	8162	8137	8137	he	244	’ attention to the large gilt button which displayed a bust of Mr. Pickwick in the centre , and the letters ‘
8165	8170	8137	8137	he	244	’ on either side . ‘
8175	8204	8205	8206	Mr. Tupman	244	’ said the stranger--‘queer set out -- old fellow ’s likeness , and “ P. C.”--What does “ P. C. ” stand for -- Peculiar Coat , eh ? ’
8220	8231	8233	8234	the stranger	9737	‘ Rather short in the waist , ai n’t it ? ’
8260	8299	8233	8234	the stranger	9737	‘ Like a general postman ’s coat -- queer coats those -- made by contract -- no measuring -- mysterious dispensations of Providence -- all the short men get long coats -- all the long men short ones . ’

8370	8376	8379	8379	he	9737	‘ No names at all ; ’
8384	8435	8379	8379	he	9737	‘ names wo n’t do-- not known -- very good names in their way , but not great ones -- capital names for a small party , but wo n’t make an impression in public assemblies -- incog . the thing -- gentlemen from London -- distinguished foreigners -- anything . ’
8557	8561	8563	8564	Mr. Tupman	244	‘ Charming women , ’
8566	8571	8573	8574	the stranger	9737	‘ Wait a minute , ’

8626	8645	8647	8648	Mr. Tupman	244	‘ Who ’s that little boy with the light hair and pink eyes , in a fancy dress ? ’
8650	8679	8647	8648	Mr. Tupman	244	‘ Hush , pray -- pink eyes -- fancy dress -- little boy -- nonsense -- ensign 97th-- Honourable Wilmot Snipe -- great family -- Snipes -- very . ’
8680	8693	8695	8699	the man at the door	1026	‘ Sir Thomas Clubber , Lady Clubber , and the Misses Clubber ! ’
8755	8770	8772	8773	the stranger	9737	‘ Commissioner -- head of the yard -- great man -- remarkably great man , ’

8853	8859	8861	8863	Mr. Tracy Tupman	244	‘ What ’s Mr. Smithie ? ’
8865	8871	8873	8874	the stranger	9737	‘ Something in the yard , ’

10793	10797	10799	10800	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ Doctor Slammer ! ’
10802	10830	10832	10832	he	276	‘ Doctor Slammer . He begged me to express his opinion that your conduct of last evening was of a description which no gentleman could endure ; and ’
10835	10845	10832	10832	he	276	‘ which no one gentleman would pursue towards another . ’
10871	10949	10868	10868	he	276	‘ My friend , Doctor Slammer , requested me to add , that he was firmly persuaded you were intoxicated during a portion of the evening , and possibly unconscious of the extent of the insult you were guilty of . He commissioned me to say , that should this be pleaded as an excuse for your behaviour , he will consent to accept a written apology , to be penned by you , from my dictation . ’
10950	10955	10957	10958	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ A written apology ! ’

11022	11076	11019	11020	the visitor	9828	‘ and in consequence of your firm refusal to give your card to Doctor Slammer , I was desired by that gentleman to identify the wearer of a very uncommon coat -- a bright blue dress - coat , with a gilt button displaying a bust , and the letters “ P. C. ” ’
11098	11159	11093	11094	Doctor Slammer	276	‘ From the inquiries I made at the bar , just now , I was convinced that the owner of the coat in question arrived here , with three gentlemen , yesterday afternoon . I immediately sent up to the gentleman who was described as appearing the head of the party , and he at once referred me to you . ’
11217	11228	11230	11230	he	276	‘ Will you allow me to detain you one moment ? ’
11232	11235	11230	11230	he	276	‘ Certainly , ’
11284	11290	11292	11293	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ It must be so , ’
11303	11366	11292	11293	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ I took too much wine after dinner , and have a very vague recollection of walking about the streets , and smoking a cigar afterwards . The fact is , I was very drunk;--I must have changed my coat -- gone somewhere -- and insulted somebody -- I have no doubt of it ; and this message is the terrible consequence . ’
11618	11636	11638	11639	the officer	1158	‘ Will you refer me to a friend , to arrange the time and place of meeting ? ’
11641	11645	11638	11639	the officer	1158	‘ Quite unnecessary , ’
11650	11667	11638	11639	the officer	1158	‘ name them to me , and I can procure the attendance of a friend afterwards . ’
11668	11677	11679	11680	the officer	1158	‘ Shall we say -- sunset this evening ? ’
11687	11691	11693	11694	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ Very good , ’
11705	11711	11693	11694	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ You know Fort Pitt ? ’
11712	11720	11638	11639	the officer	1158	‘ Yes ; I saw it yesterday . ’
11721	11786	11693	11694	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ If you will take the trouble to turn into the field which borders the trench , take the foot - path to the left when you arrive at an angle of the fortification , and keep straight on , till you see me , I will precede you to a secluded place , where the affair can be conducted without fear of interruption . ’
11787	11792	11794	11795	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ Fear of interruption ! ’
11797	11806	11808	11809	the officer	1158	‘ Nothing more to arrange , I think , ’
11811	11820	11822	11823	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ I am not aware of anything more , ’
11825	11830	11822	11823	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ Good - morning . ’
11831	11836	11838	11839	the officer	1158	‘ Good - morning ; ’
11945	11948	11950	11951	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ Snodgrass , ’

12001	12005	11998	11999	Mr. Snodgrass	242	‘ Hear me swear-- ’
12006	12011	12013	12013	Winkle	276	‘ No , no , ’
12031	12045	12013	12013	Winkle	276	‘ do n’t swear , do n’t swear ; it ’s quite unnecessary . ’
12079	12095	12097	12098	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ I want your assistance , my dear fellow , in an affair of honour , ’
12100	12106	12108	12109	Mr. Snodgrass	242	‘ You shall have it , ’
12117	12129	12131	12132	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ With a doctor -- Doctor Slammer , of the 97th , ’
12145	12170	12131	12132	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ an affair with an officer , seconded by another officer , at sunset this evening , in a lonely field beyond Fort Pitt . ’
12171	12177	12179	12180	Mr. Snodgrass	242	‘ I will attend you , ’
12226	12233	12235	12236	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ The consequences may be dreadful , ’
12238	12243	12245	12246	Mr. Snodgrass	242	‘ I hope not , ’
12248	12261	12263	12264	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ The doctor , I believe , is a very good shot , ’
12266	12274	12276	12277	Mr. Snodgrass	242	‘ Most of these military men are , ’
12280	12290	12276	12277	Mr. Snodgrass	242	‘ but so are you , ai n’t you ? ’
12313	12316	12317	12317	he	276	‘ Snodgrass , ’
12327	12353	12317	12317	he	276	‘ if I fall , you will find in a packet which I shall place in your hands a note for my-- for my father . ’

12395	12430	12392	12393	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ or if the doctor falls , you , my dear friend , will be tried as an accessory before the fact . Shall I involve my friend in transportation -- possibly for life ! ’

13468	13474	13462	13462	he	242	‘ Give me your cloak . ’
13475	13486	13489	13489	Winkle	276	‘ You have got the packet , my dear fellow , ’
13491	13495	13497	13498	Mr. Snodgrass	242	‘ All right , ’
13500	13508	13497	13498	Mr. Snodgrass	242	‘ Be steady , and wing him . ’
13536	13687	13522	13522	bystanders	1209	‘ Go in , and win’--an admirable thing to recommend , if you only know how to do it . He took off his cloak , however , in silence -- it always took a long time to undo that cloak -- and accepted the pistol . The seconds retired , the gentleman on the camp - stool did the same , and the belligerents approached each other . Mr. Winkle was always remarkable for extreme humanity . It is conjectured that his unwillingness to hurt a fellow - creature intentionally was the cause of his shutting his eyes when he arrived at the fatal spot ; and that the circumstance of his eyes being closed , prevented his observing the very extraordinary and unaccountable demeanour of Doctor Slammer . That gentleman started , stared , retreated , rubbed his eyes , stared again , and , finally , shouted , ‘
13692	13693	13522	13522	bystanders	1209	’ ‘
13699	13714	13718	13719	the man	835	’ said Doctor Slammer , as his friend and Mr. Snodgrass came running up ; ‘
13721	13722	13723	13725	Not the man	1212	’ ‘
13727	13734	13736	13737	the man	835	’ said Doctor Slammer ’s second . ‘
13739	13744	13746	13747	the man	835	’ said Mr. Snodgrass . ‘
13749	13762	13746	13747	the man	835	’ said the gentleman with the camp - stool in his hand . ‘
13766	13772	13746	13747	the man	835	’ replied the little doctor . ‘
13784	13785	13776	13782	the person who insulted me last night	1215	’ ‘
13789	13794	13776	13782	the person who insulted me last night	1215	’ exclaimed the officer . ‘
13797	13807	13776	13782	the person who insulted me last night	1215	’ said the gentleman with the camp - stool . ‘
13857	13979	13980	13980	I	0	’ and having delivered this suggestion , with a very sage and mysterious air , the man with the camp - stool took a large pinch of snuff , and looked profoundly round , with the air of an authority in such matters . Now Mr. Winkle had opened his eyes , and his ears too , when he heard his adversary call out for a cessation of hostilities ; and perceiving by what he had afterwards said that there was , beyond all question , some mistake in the matter , he at once foresaw the increase of reputation he should inevitably acquire by concealing the real motive of his coming out ; he therefore stepped boldly forward , and said-- ‘
13990	13991	13986	13986	I	0	’ ‘
13996	14006	13986	13986	I	0	’ said the man with the camp - stool , ‘
14022	14023	14011	14012	Doctor Slammer	276	’ ‘
14030	14037	14028	14028	Payne	280	’ said the doctor ’s second . ‘
14052	14053	14040	14040	you	280	’ ‘
14062	14073	14040	14040	you	280	’ said the man with the camp - stool indignantly . ‘
14083	14088	14074	14074	I	0	’ said the other . ‘
14097	14098	14095	14095	Sir	9716	’ ‘
14103	14118	14101	14101	Sir	9716	’ replied Mr. Winkle , who had had time to deliberate upon his answer , ‘
14188	14189	14190	14190	My	0	’ ‘
14194	14207	14192	14192	Sir	9716	’ said the good - humoured little doctor advancing with extended hand , ‘
14243	14244	14245	14245	I	0	’ ‘
14255	14260	14253	14253	Sir	9716	’ said Mr. Winkle . ‘
14271	14277	14269	14269	Sir	9716	’ said the little doctor . ‘
14291	14361	14289	14289	sir	9716	’ replied Mr. Winkle . Thereupon the doctor and Mr. Winkle shook hands , and then Mr. Winkle and Lieutenant Tappleton ( the doctor ’s second ) , and then Mr. Winkle and the man with the camp - stool , and , finally , Mr. Winkle and Mr. Snodgrass -- the last - named gentleman in an excess of admiration at the noble conduct of his heroic friend . ‘
14368	14373	14362	14362	I	0	’ said Lieutenant Tappleton . ‘
14376	14381	14362	14362	I	0	’ added the doctor . ‘
14384	14394	14362	14362	I	0	’ interposed the man with the camp - stool , ‘
14419	14435	14412	14412	he	276	’ Mr. Winkle , with great self - denial , expressed himself quite satisfied already . ‘
14439	14449	14456	14456	himself	1236	’ said the man with the camp - stool , ‘
14486	14550	14456	14456	himself	1236	’ Mr. Snodgrass hastily professed himself very much obliged with the handsome offer of the gentleman who had spoken last , which he was only induced to decline by his entire contentment with the whole proceedings . The two seconds adjusted the cases , and the whole party left the ground in a much more lively manner than they had proceeded to it . ‘
14557	14573	14574	14574	I	0	’ inquired Doctor Slammer of Mr. Winkle , as they walked on most amicably together . ‘
14587	14592	14574	14574	I	0	’ was the reply . ‘
14624	14630	14632	14632	you	1237	’ said the little doctor ; ‘
14637	14638	14632	14632	you	1237	’ ‘
14645	14650	14641	14642	some friends	1243	’ replied Mr. Winkle , ‘
14675	14676	14666	14667	your friend	888	’ ‘
14681	14687	14666	14667	your friend	888	’ said the little doctor ; ‘
14702	14703	14666	14667	your friend	888	’ ‘
14709	14714	14666	14667	your friend	888	’ said Mr. Winkle . ‘
14733	14734	14730	14731	Mr. Tupman	244	’ ‘
14746	14758	14742	14742	I	0	’ replied Doctor Slammer , little suspecting who Mr. Tupman was . ‘
14766	14771	14759	14759	You	1237	’ said Mr. Snodgrass . ‘
14776	14829	14759	14759	You	1237	’ By this time they had reached the road . Cordial farewells were exchanged , and the party separated . Doctor Slammer and his friends repaired to the barracks , and Mr. Winkle , accompanied by Mr. Snodgrass , returned to their inn . CHAPTER III . A NEW ACQUAINTANCE -- THE STROLLER ’S
15184	15249	15181	15181	he	240	‘ A friend of our friend ’s here . We discovered this morning that our friend was connected with the theatre in this place , though he is not desirous to have it generally known , and this gentleman is a member of the same profession . He was about to favour us with a little anecdote connected with it , when you entered . ’
15250	15255	15257	15265	the green - coated stranger of the day before	1256	‘ Lots of anecdote , ’
15280	15310	15311	15312	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ Rum fellow -- does the heavy business -- no actor -- strange man -- all sorts of miseries -- Dismal Jemmy , we call him on the circuit . ’
15324	15327	15318	15319	the gentleman	883	‘ Dismal Jemmy ’
15353	15357	15359	15360	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Now sir , ’
15362	15377	15359	15360	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ will you oblige us by proceeding with what you were going to relate ? ’
15424	15425	15426	15426	I	0	’ ‘
15436	15451	15428	15428	I	0	’ replied Mr. Snodgrass , rather taken aback by the abruptness of the question . ‘
15493	15494	15498	15498	Sir	9716	’ ‘
15500	15505	15498	15498	Sir	9716	’ replied Mr. Snodgrass . ‘
15512	15518	15498	15498	Sir	9716	’ continued the dismal man , ‘
15574	15575	15740	15742	the dismal man	10022	’ ‘
15578	15604	15740	15742	the dismal man	10022	’ said Mr. Snodgrass : for the sunken eye of the dismal man rested on him , and he felt it necessary to say something . ‘
15610	15616	15608	15608	Jemmy	282	’ said the Spanish traveller , ‘
15637	15638	15740	15742	the dismal man	10022	’ ‘
15650	15712	15713	15714	The Stroller	10010	’ said Mr. Pickwick . The dismal man took the hint , and having mixed a glass of brandy - and- water , and slowly swallowed half of it , opened the roll of paper and proceeded , partly to read , and partly to relate , the following incident , which we find recorded on the Transactions of the Club as ‘
15718	15721	15713	15714	The Stroller	10010	’ THE STROLLER ’S
15723	15738	15740	15742	the dismal man	10022	‘ There is nothing of the marvellous in what I am going to relate , ’
15744	15829	15740	15742	the dismal man	10022	‘ there is nothing even uncommon in it . Want and sickness are too common in many stations of life to deserve more notice than is usually bestowed on the most ordinary vicissitudes of human nature . I have thrown these few notes together , because the subject of them was well known to me for many years . I traced his progress downwards , step by step , until at last he reached that excess of destitution from which he never rose again . ‘
16030	16243	16250	16250	he	1277	‘ Everybody who is at all acquainted with theatrical matters knows what a host of shabby , poverty - stricken men hang about the stage of a large establishment -- not regularly engaged actors , but ballet people , procession men , tumblers , and so forth , who are taken on during the run of a pantomime , or an Easter piece , and are then discharged , until the production of some heavy spectacle occasions a new demand for their services . To this mode of life the man was compelled to resort ; and taking the chair every night , at some low theatrical house , at once put him in possession of a few more shillings weekly , and enabled him to gratify his old propensity . Even this resource shortly failed him ; his irregularities were too great to admit of his earning the wretched pittance he might thus have procured , and he was actually reduced to a state bordering on starvation , only procuring a trifle occasionally by borrowing it of some old companion , or by obtaining an appearance at one or other of the commonest of the minor theatres ; and when he did earn anything it was spent in the old way . ‘
16567	16663	16552	16552	I	0	‘ A few nights afterwards , a boy put a dirty scrap of paper in my hand , on which were scrawled a few words in pencil , intimating that the man was dangerously ill , and begging me , after the performance , to see him at his lodgings in some street -- I forget the name of it now -- at no great distance from the theatre . I promised to comply , as soon as I could get away ; and after the curtain fell , sallied forth on my melancholy errand . ‘
16827	16911	16912	16912	He	1295	‘ A wretched - looking woman , the man ’s wife , met me on the stairs , and , telling me that he had just fallen into a kind of doze , led me softly in , and placed a chair for me at the bedside . The sick man was lying with his face turned towards the wall ; and as he took no heed of my presence , I had leisure to observe the place in which I found myself . ‘
17111	17185	17194	17195	his wife	1301	‘ I had had time to note these little particulars , and to mark the heavy breathing and feverish startings of the sick man , before he was aware of my presence . In the restless attempts to procure some easy resting - place for his head , he tossed his hand out of the bed , and it fell on mine . He started up , and stared eagerly in my face . ‘
17212	17283	17293	17293	I	0	‘ “ Ah ! ” said the invalid , passing his hand across his forehead ; “ Hutley-- Hutley -- let me see . ” He seemed endeavouring to collect his thoughts for a few seconds , and then grasping me tightly by the wrist said , “ Do n’t leave me -- don’t leave me , old fellow . She ’ll murder me ; I know she will . ” ‘
17300	17322	17293	17293	I	0	‘ “ Since yesterday night , ” she replied . “ John , John , do n’t you know me ? ” ‘
17464	17571	17451	17451	He	0	‘ I knew but too well what all this meant . If I could have entertained any doubt of it , for an instant , one glance at the woman ’s pale face and wasted form would have sufficiently explained the real state of the case . “ You had better stand aside , ” said I to the poor creature . “ You can do him no good . Perhaps he will be calmer , if he does not see you . ” She retired out of the man ’s sight . He opened his eyes after a few seconds , and looked anxiously round . ‘
17582	17600	17578	17578	he	0	‘ “ Yes -- yes , ” said I ; “ she shall not hurt you . ” ‘
17749	17800	17801	17801	I	0	‘ I sickened at the thought of the long course of cruelty and neglect which must have occurred to produce such an impression on such a man . I could say nothing in reply ; for who could offer hope , or consolation , to the abject being before me ? ‘
17946	18038	18039	18039	I	0	‘ I kept my promise . The last four - and - twenty hours had produced a frightful alteration . The eyes , though deeply sunk and heavy , shone with a lustre frightful to behold . The lips were parched , and cracked in many places ; the hard , dry skin glowed with a burning heat ; and there was an almost unearthly air of wild anxiety in the man ’s face , indicating even more strongly the ravages of the disease . The fever was at its height . ‘
18161	18611	18145	18146	the clown	1317	‘ It is a touching thing to hear the mind reverting to the ordinary occupations and pursuits of health , when the body lies before you weak and helpless ; but when those occupations are of a character the most strongly opposed to anything we associate with grave and solemn ideas , the impression produced is infinitely more powerful . The theatre and the public - house were the chief themes of the wretched man ’s wanderings . It was evening , he fancied ; he had a part to play that night ; it was late , and he must leave home instantly . Why did they hold him , and prevent his going?--he should lose the money -- he must go . No ! they would not let him . He hid his face in his burning hands , and feebly bemoaned his own weakness , and the cruelty of his persecutors . A short pause , and he shouted out a few doggerel rhymes -- the last he had ever learned . He rose in bed , drew up his withered limbs , and rolled about in uncouth positions ; he was acting -- he was at the theatre . A minute ’s silence , and he murmured the burden of some roaring song . He had reached the old house at last -- how hot the room was . He had been ill , very ill , but he was well now , and happy . Fill up his glass . Who was that , that dashed it from his lips ? It was the same persecutor that had followed him before . He fell back upon his pillow and moaned aloud . A short period of oblivion , and he was wandering through a tedious maze of low - arched rooms -- so low , sometimes , that he must creep upon his hands and knees to make his way along ; it was close and dark , and every way he turned , some obstacle impeded his progress . There were insects , too , hideous crawling things , with eyes that stared upon him , and filled the very air around , glistening horribly amidst the thick darkness of the place . The walls and ceiling were alive with reptiles -- the vault expanded to an enormous size -- frightful figures flitted to and fro -- and the faces of men he knew , rendered hideous by gibing and mouthing , peered out from among them ; they were searing him with heated irons , and binding his head with cords till the blood started ; and he struggled madly for life . ‘
18840	18956	18834	18834	he	1319	’ It would afford us the highest gratification to be enabled to record Mr. Pickwick ’s opinion of the foregoing anecdote . We have little doubt that we should have been enabled to present it to our readers , but for a most unfortunate occurrence . Mr. Pickwick had replaced on the table the glass which , during the last few sentences of the tale , he had retained in his hand ; and had just made up his mind to speak -- indeed , we have the authority of Mr. Snodgrass ’s note - book for stating , that he had actually opened his mouth -- when the waiter entered the room , and said-- ‘
18962	19027	18960	18960	Sir	9716	’ It has been conjectured that Mr. Pickwick was on the point of delivering some remarks which would have enlightened the world , if not the Thames , when he was thus interrupted ; for he gazed sternly on the waiter ’s countenance , and then looked round on the company generally , as if seeking for information relative to the new - comers . ‘
19030	19037	18960	18960	Sir	9716	’ said Mr. Winkle , rising , ‘
19051	19061	19047	19049	Very pleasant fellows	1327	’ added Mr. Winkle , after the waiter had retired-- ‘
19083	19105	19106	19107	Lieutenant Tappleton	1330	’ Mr. Pickwick ’s equanimity was at once restored . The waiter returned , and ushered three gentlemen into the room . ‘
19109	19114	19106	19107	Lieutenant Tappleton	1330	’ said Mr. Winkle , ‘
19153	19176	19151	19152	Doctor Slam--	1337	’ Here Mr. Winkle suddenly paused ; for strong emotion was visible on the countenance both of Mr. Tupman and the doctor . ‘
19186	19195	19177	19177	I	0	’ said the Doctor , with marked emphasis . ‘
19198	19203	19181	19183	this _ gentleman	1338	’ said Mr. Winkle . ‘
19218	19234	19207	19208	that person	1339	’ said the doctor , bestowing a scrutinising glance on the green - coated stranger . ‘
19255	19273	19237	19237	I	0	’ Saying which the doctor scowled magnanimously on the stranger , and whispered his friend Lieutenant Tappleton . ‘
19280	19292	19274	19274	You	0	’ said that gentleman , at the conclusion of the whisper . ‘
19298	19303	19293	19293	I	0	’ replied Doctor Slammer . ‘
19314	19327	19304	19304	You	0	’ murmured the owner of the camp- stool , with great importance . ‘
19334	19339	19332	19332	Payne	280	’ interposed the lieutenant . ‘
19350	19386	19341	19341	you	280	’ he said , addressing Mr. Pickwick , who was considerably mystified by this very unpolite by - play--‘will you allow me to ask you , Sir , whether that person belongs to your party ? ’
19387	19392	19394	19395	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ No , Sir , ’
19397	19405	19394	19395	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ he is a guest of ours . ’
19406	19420	19422	19423	the lieutenant	10093	‘ He is a member of your club , or I am mistaken ? ’
19426	19430	19432	19433	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Certainly not , ’
19435	19444	19446	19447	the lieutenant	10093	‘ And never wears your club - button ? ’
19449	19454	19456	19459	the astonished Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ No -- never ! ’
19518	19521	19523	19524	the doctor	1073	‘ Sir , ’
19556	19566	19536	19537	that gentleman	9760	‘ you were at the ball here last night ! ’
19584	19591	19593	19594	the doctor	1073	‘ That person was your companion , ’
19609	19614	19616	19617	the doctor	1073	‘ Now , sir , ’
19622	19670	19616	19617	the doctor	1073	‘ I ask you once again , in the presence of these gentlemen , whether you choose to give me your card , and to receive the treatment of a gentleman ; or whether you impose upon me the necessity of personally chastising you on the spot ? ’
19671	19676	19678	19679	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Stay , sir , ’
19681	19703	19678	19679	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I really can not allow this matter to go any further without some explanation . Tupman , recount the circumstances . ’
19735	19738	19704	19705	Mr. Tupman	244	‘ after dinner ’
19791	19803	19774	19775	Lieutenant Tappleton	281	‘ Have n’t I seen you at the theatre , Sir ? ’
19804	19807	19809	19811	the unabashed stranger	1353	‘ Certainly , ’
19813	19820	19822	19823	the lieutenant	10093	‘ He is a strolling actor ! ’
19863	19864	19859	19859	Slammer	276	’ ‘
19867	19873	19859	19859	Slammer	276	’ said the dignified Payne . ‘
19884	19893	19895	19895	me	0	’ said Lieutenant Tappleton , addressing Mr. Pickwick ; ‘
19931	19941	19929	19929	Sir	9716	’ and the lieutenant bounced out of the room . ‘
19950	19957	19944	19944	me	0	’ said the irascible Doctor Payne , ‘
20016	20172	20014	20014	Sir	9716	’ Having concluded this speech , and uttered the last three words in a loud key , he stalked majestically after his friend , closely followed by Doctor Slammer , who said nothing , but contented himself by withering the company with a look . Rising rage and extreme bewilderment had swelled the noble breast of Mr. Pickwick , almost to the bursting of his waistcoat , during the delivery of the above defiance . He stood transfixed to the spot , gazing on vacancy . The closing of the door recalled him to himself . He rushed forward with fury in his looks , and fire in his eye . His hand was upon the lock of the door ; in another instant it would have been on the throat of Doctor Payne of the 43rd , had not Mr. Snodgrass seized his revered leader by the coat tail , and dragged him backwards . ‘
20176	20181	20182	20182	Winkle	276	’ cried Mr. Snodgrass ; ‘
20200	20201	20014	20014	Sir	9716	’ ‘
20206	20211	20203	20203	me	0	’ said Mr. Pickwick . ‘
20216	20241	20203	20203	me	0	’ shouted Mr. Snodgrass ; and by the united efforts of the whole company , Mr. Pickwick was forced into an arm - chair . ‘
20246	20254	20203	20203	me	0	’ said the green - coated stranger ; ‘
20274	20343	20344	20344	They	1369	’ Having previously tested the virtues of a bumper , which had been mixed by the dismal man , the stranger applied the glass to Mr. Pickwick ’s mouth ; and the remainder of its contents rapidly disappeared . There was a short pause ; the brandy - and - water had done its work ; the amiable countenance of Mr. Pickwick was fast recovering its customary expression . ‘
20351	20357	20358	20358	You	0	’ said the dismal man . ‘
20364	20369	20358	20358	You	0	’ replied Mr. Pickwick , ‘
20397	21209	20395	20395	Sir	9716	’ The dismal man readily complied ; a circle was again formed round the table , and harmony once more prevailed . Some lingering irritability appeared to find a resting - place in Mr. Winkle ’s bosom , occasioned possibly by the temporary abstraction of his coat -- though it is scarcely reasonable to suppose that so slight a circumstance can have excited even a passing feeling of anger in a Pickwickian ’s breast . With this exception , their good - humour was completely restored ; and the evening concluded with the conviviality with which it had begun . CHAPTER IV . A FIELD DAY AND BIVOUAC -- MORE NEW FRIENDS -- AN INVITATION TO THE COUNTRY Many authors entertain , not only a foolish , but a really dishonest objection to acknowledge the sources whence they derive much valuable information . We have no such feeling . We are merely endeavouring to discharge , in an upright manner , the responsible duties of our editorial functions ; and whatever ambition we might have felt under other circumstances to lay claim to the authorship of these adventures , a regard for truth forbids us to do more than claim the merit of their judicious arrangement and impartial narration . The Pickwick papers are our New River Head ; and we may be compared to the New River Company . The labours of others have raised for us an immense reservoir of important facts . We merely lay them on , and communicate them , in a clear and gentle stream , through the medium of these pages , to a world thirsting for Pickwickian knowledge . Acting in this spirit , and resolutely proceeding on our determination to avow our obligations to the authorities we have consulted , we frankly say , that to the note - book of Mr. Snodgrass are we indebted for the particulars recorded in this and the succeeding chapter -- particulars which , now that we have disburdened our consciences , we shall proceed to detail without further comment . The whole population of Rochester and the adjoining towns rose from their beds at an early hour of the following morning , in a state of the utmost bustle and excitement . A grand review was to take place upon the lines . The manoeuvres of half a dozen regiments were to be inspected by the eagle eye of the commander - in - chief ; temporary fortifications had been erected , the citadel was to be attacked and taken , and a mine was to be sprung . Mr. Pickwick was , as our readers may have gathered from the slight extract we gave from his description of Chatham , an enthusiastic admirer of the army . Nothing could have been more delightful to him -- nothing could have harmonised so well with the peculiar feeling of each of his companions -- as this sight . Accordingly they were soon afoot , and walking in the direction of the scene of action , towards which crowds of people were already pouring from a variety of quarters . The appearance of everything on the lines denoted that the approaching ceremony was one of the utmost grandeur and importance . There were sentries posted to keep the ground for the troops , and servants on the batteries keeping places for the ladies , and sergeants running to and fro , with vellum - covered books under their arms , and Colonel Bulder , in full military uniform , on horseback , galloping first to one place and then to another , and backing his horse among the people , and prancing , and curvetting , and shouting in a most alarming manner , and making himself very hoarse in the voice , and very red in the face , without any assignable cause or reason whatever . Officers were running backwards and forwards , first communicating with Colonel Bulder , and then ordering the sergeants , and then running away altogether ; and even the very privates themselves looked from behind their glazed stocks with an air of mysterious solemnity , which sufficiently bespoke the special nature of the occasion . Mr. Pickwick and his three companions stationed themselves in the front of the crowd , and patiently awaited the commencement of the proceedings . The throng was increasing every moment ; and the efforts they were compelled to make , to retain the position they had gained , sufficiently occupied their attention during the two hours that ensued . At one time there was a sudden pressure from behind , and then Mr. Pickwick was jerked forward for several yards , with a degree of speed and elasticity highly inconsistent with the general gravity of his demeanour ; at another moment there was a request to ‘
21212	21287	21289	21289	he	1372	’ from the front , and then the butt - end of a musket was either dropped upon Mr. Pickwick ’s toe , to remind him of the demand , or thrust into his chest , to insure its being complied with . Then some facetious gentlemen on the left , after pressing sideways in a body , and squeezing Mr. Snodgrass into the very last extreme of human torture , would request to know ‘
21293	21295	21289	21289	he	1372	’ to ’
21639	21648	21649	21649	he	240	‘ Can anything be finer or more delightful ? ’
21655	21658	21660	21661	that gentleman	9760	‘ Nothing , ’
21684	21695	21697	21698	Mr. Snodgrass	242	‘ It is indeed a noble and a brilliant sight , ’
21712	21769	21697	21698	Mr. Snodgrass	242	‘ to see the gallant defenders of their country drawn up in brilliant array before its peaceful citizens ; their faces beaming -- not with warlike ferocity , but with civilised gentleness ; their eyes flashing -- not with the rude fire of rapine or revenge , but with the soft light of humanity and intelligence . ’
21812	21815	21856	21857	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ eyes front ’
21845	21854	21856	21857	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ We are in a capital situation now , ’
21879	21882	21885	21886	Mr. Snodgrass	242	‘ Capital ! ’
21891	21898	21900	21901	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ What are they doing now ? ’
21907	21915	21917	21918	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ I -- I -- rather think , ’
21925	21930	21952	21953	Mr. Snodgrass	242	’re going to fire . ’
21931	21934	21936	21937	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Nonsense , ’
21940	21950	21952	21953	Mr. Snodgrass	242	‘ I -- I -- really think they are , ’
21958	21961	21963	21964	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Impossible , ’
22133	22152	22154	22155	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ But -- but -- suppose some of the men should happen to have ball cartridges by mistake , ’
22167	22185	22154	22155	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ I heard something whistle through the air now -- so sharp ; close to my ear . ’
22186	22200	22202	22203	Mr. Snodgrass	242	‘ We had better throw ourselves on our faces , had n’t we ? ’
22205	22215	22217	22218	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ No , no -- it ’s over now , ’
22533	22536	22538	22543	the officers of the advancing line	1408	‘ Hoi ! ’
22545	22552	22538	22543	the officers of the advancing line	1408	‘ Get out of the way ! ’
22561	22569	22571	22573	the agitated Pickwickians	239	‘ Where are we to go to ? ’
22575	22582	22571	22573	the agitated Pickwickians	239	‘ Hoi -- hoi -- hoi ! ’
23295	23300	23302	23303	Mr. Tupman	244	‘ Pickwick -- Pickwick , ’
23305	23313	23302	23303	Mr. Tupman	244	‘ come up here . Make haste . ’
23314	23325	23327	23329	the stout gentleman	1436	‘ Come along , Sir . Pray , come up , ’
23331	23348	23327	23329	the stout gentleman	1436	‘ Joe!--damn that boy , he ’s gone to sleep again.--Joe , let down the steps . ’
23382	23390	23392	23394	the stout man	1438	‘ Room for you all , gentlemen , ’
23396	23424	23392	23394	the stout man	1438	‘ Two inside , and one out . Joe , make room for one of these gentlemen on the box . Now , Sir , come along ; ’
23473	23478	23480	23482	the stout man	1438	‘ Well , gentlemen , ’
23484	23554	23480	23482	the stout man	1438	‘ very glad to see you . Know you very well , gentlemen , though you may n’t remember me . I spent some ev’nin ’s at your club last winter -- picked up my friend Mr. Tupman here this morning , and very glad I was to see him . Well , Sir , and how are you ? You do look uncommon well , to be sure . ’
23575	23585	23587	23589	the stout gentleman	1436	‘ Well , and how are you , sir ? ’
23598	23688	23587	23589	the stout gentleman	1436	‘ Charming , eh ? Well , that ’s right-- that ’s right . And how are you , sir ( to Mr. Winkle ) ? Well , I am glad to hear you say you are well ; very glad I am , to be sure . My daughters , gentlemen -- my gals these are ; and that ’s my sister , Miss Rachael Wardle . She ’s a Miss , she is ; and yet she ai n’t a Miss -- eh , Sir , eh ? ’
23709	23714	23716	23717	Miss Wardle	289	‘ Lor , brother ! ’
23724	23729	23731	23733	the stout gentleman	1436	‘ True , true , ’
23735	23784	23731	23733	the stout gentleman	1436	‘ no one can deny it . Gentlemen , I beg your pardon ; this is my friend Mr. Trundle . And now you all know each other , let ’s be comfortable and happy , and see what ’s going forward ; that ’s what I say . ’
24061	24066	24068	24070	the stout gentleman	1436	‘ Joe , Joe ! ’
24088	24131	24132	24134	The fat boy	1437	‘ Damn that boy , he ’s gone to sleep again . Be good enough to pinch him , sir -- in the leg , if you please ; nothing else wakes him -- thank you . Undo the hamper , Joe . ’
24185	24192	24194	24196	the stout gentleman	1436	‘ Now we must sit close , ’
24207	24269	24272	24272	Joe	241	’ sleeves , and a vast quantity of blushing at sundry jocose proposals , that the ladies should sit in the gentlemen ’s laps , the whole party were stowed down in the barouche ; and the stout gentleman proceeded to hand the things from the fat boy ( who had mounted up behind for the purpose ) into the carriage . ‘
24278	24309	24272	24272	Joe	241	’ The knives and forks were handed in , and the ladies and gentlemen inside , and Mr. Winkle on the box , were each furnished with those useful instruments . ‘
24316	24328	24272	24272	Joe	241	’ A similar process employed in the distribution of the crockery . ‘
24351	24377	24349	24349	Joe	241	’ ( Sundry taps on the head with a stick , and the fat boy , with some difficulty , roused from his lethargy . ) ‘
24385	24429	24349	24349	Joe	241	’ There was something in the sound of the last word which roused the unctuous boy . He jumped up , and the leaden eyes which twinkled behind his mountainous cheeks leered horribly upon the food as he unpacked it from the basket . ‘
24434	24481	24349	24349	Joe	241	’ said Mr. Wardle ; for the fat boy was hanging fondly over a capon , which he seemed wholly unable to part with . The boy sighed deeply , and , bestowing an ardent gaze upon its plumpness , unwillingly consigned it to his master . ‘
24523	24565	24634	24634	You	0	’ Such were the hurried orders which issued from the lips of Mr. Wardle , as he handed in the different articles described , and placed dishes in everybody ’s hands , and on everybody ’s knees , in endless number . ‘
24572	24586	24634	24634	You	0	’ inquired that jolly personage , when the work of destruction had commenced . ‘
24589	24603	24634	24634	You	0	’ said Mr. Winkle , who was carving a fowl on the box . ‘
24608	24609	24634	24634	You	0	’ ‘
24615	24616	24634	24634	You	0	’ ‘

24635	24639	24634	24634	You	0	’re very good . ’
24640	24643	24634	24634	You	0	‘ Joe ! ’
24644	24649	24651	24651	He	0	‘ Yes , Sir . ’
24668	24686	24651	24651	He	0	‘ Bottle of wine to the gentleman on the box . Glad to see you , Sir . ’
24687	24690	24691	24692	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ Thank’ee . ’
24711	24723	24725	24726	Mr. Trundle	290	‘ Will you permit me to have the pleasure , Sir ? ’
24731	24736	24738	24739	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ With great pleasure , ’
24766	24777	24779	24781	the spinster aunt	1474	‘ How dear Emily is flirting with the strange gentleman , ’
24799	24807	24809	24812	the jolly old gentleman	1477	‘ Oh ! I do n’t know , ’
24814	24834	24809	24812	the jolly old gentleman	1477	‘ all very natural , I dare say -- nothing unusual . Mr. Pickwick , some wine , Sir ? ’
24854	24860	24862	24864	the spinster aunt	1474	‘ Emily , my dear , ’
24871	24880	24862	24864	the spinster aunt	1474	‘ do n’t talk so loud , love . ’
24881	24886	24862	24864	the spinster aunt	1474	‘ Lor , aunt ! ’
24887	24905	24907	24909	Miss Isabella Wardle	295	‘ Aunt and the little old gentleman want to have it all to themselves , I think , ’
24937	24944	24946	24947	Miss Wardle	294	‘ Young girls have such spirits , ’
24978	24984	24986	24987	Mr. Tupman	244	‘ Oh , they have , ’
25002	25008	24986	24987	Mr. Tupman	244	‘ It ’s quite delightful . ’
25009	25012	25014	25015	Miss Wardle	294	‘ Hem ! ’
25020	25026	25032	25032	his	244	‘ Will you permit me ? ’
25055	25061	25032	25032	his	244	‘ Will you permit me ? ’
25062	25067	25068	25069	Mr. Tupman	244	‘ Oh , sir ! ’
25100	25109	25111	25113	their affectionate aunt	1483	‘ Do you think my dear nieces pretty ? ’
25118	25129	25131	25133	the ready Pickwickian	245	‘ I should , if their aunt was n’t here , ’
25140	25173	25131	25133	the ready Pickwickian	245	‘ Oh , you naughty man -- but really , if their complexions were a little better , do n’t you think they would be nice - looking girls -- by candlelight ? ’
25174	25182	25184	25185	Mr. Tupman	244	‘ Yes ; I think they would , ’
25193	25208	25184	25185	Mr. Tupman	244	‘ Oh , you quiz -- I know what you were going to say . ’
25209	25212	25214	25215	Mr. Tupman	244	‘ What ? ’
25231	25310	25223	25223	his	244	‘ You were going to say that Isabel stoops -- I know you were -- you men are such observers . Well , so she does ; it ca n’t be denied ; and , certainly , if there is one thing more than another that makes a girl look ugly it is stooping . I often tell her that when she gets a little older she ’ll be quite frightful . Well , you are a quiz ! ’
25336	25342	25346	25346	Rachael	289	‘ What a sarcastic smile , ’
25348	25352	25346	25346	Rachael	289	‘ I declare I ’m

25389	25402	25403	25403	You	244	’ said Mr. Tupman , who had not the slightest notion himself . ‘
25406	25486	25403	25403	You	244	’ said the amiable aunt , sinking her voice still lower--‘you mean , that you do n’t think Isabella ’s stooping is as bad as Emily ’s boldness . Well , she is bold ! You can not think how wretched it makes me sometimes -- I’m sure I cry about it for hours together -- my dear brother is _ so _ good , and so unsuspicious , that he never sees it ; if he did , I ’m
25510	25528	25529	25529	I	0	’ ( Here the affectionate relative heaved a deep sigh , and shook her head despondingly ) . ‘
25530	25538	25540	25542	Miss Emily Wardle	294	’m sure aunt ’s talking about us , ’
25556	25557	25559	25559	she	294	’ ‘
25561	25569	25559	25559	she	294	’ replied Isabella.--‘Hem ! aunt , dear ! ’
25570	25577	25551	25551	she	294	‘ Yes , my dear love ! ’
25578	25580	25559	25559	she	294	‘ I ’m
25615	25674	25676	25677	that boy	10162	’ However well deserved this piece of retaliation might have been , it was as vindictive a one as could well have been resorted to . There is no guessing in what form of reply the aunt ’s indignation would have vented itself , had not Mr. Wardle unconsciously changed the subject , by calling emphatically for Joe . ‘
25679	25685	25686	25686	he	10162	’ said the old gentleman , ‘
25693	25694	25686	25686	he	10162	’ ‘
25701	25706	25695	25697	Very extraordinary boy	1487	’ said Mr. Pickwick ; ‘
25715	25716	25708	25708	he	10162	’ ‘
25719	25725	25708	25708	he	10162	’ said the old gentleman , ‘
25745	25746	25740	25740	he	10162	’ ‘
25751	25756	25740	25740	he	10162	’ said Mr. Pickwick . ‘
25762	25768	25740	25740	he	10162	’ returned the old gentleman ; ‘
25770	25809	25740	25740	he	10162	’m proud of that boy-- would n’t part with him on any account -- he ’s a natural curiosity ! Here , Joe -- Joe -- take these things away , and open another bottle -- d’ye hear ? ’
25966	25971	25978	25978	he	10238	‘ Now , mind , ’
26005	26015	25978	25978	he	10238	‘ we shall see you all to - morrow . ’
26016	26020	26022	26023	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Most certainly , ’
26025	26032	26022	26023	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ You have got the address ? ’
26033	26040	26042	26043	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Manor Farm , Dingley Dell , ’
26050	26055	26057	26059	the old gentleman	10238	‘ That ’s it , ’
26061	26130	26057	26059	the old gentleman	10238	‘ I do n’t let you off , mind , under a week ; and undertake that you shall see everything worth seeing . If you ’ve come down for a country life , come to me , and I ’ll give you plenty of it . Joe -- damn that boy , he ’s gone to sleep again -- Joe , help Tom put in the horses . ’
26592	26597	26599	26601	the dismal man	10022	‘ Contemplating the scene ? ’
26603	26607	26609	26610	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I was , ’
26612	26622	26609	26610	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ And congratulating yourself on being up so soon ? ’
26628	26670	26623	26624	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Ah ! people need to rise early , to see the sun in all his splendour , for his brightness seldom lasts the day through . The morning of day and the morning of life are but too much alike . ’
26671	26678	26680	26681	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ You speak truly , sir , ’
26683	26689	26691	26693	the dismal man	10022	‘ How common the saying , ’
26695	26742	26691	26693	the dismal man	10022	‘ “ The morning ’s too fine to last . ” How well might it be applied to our everyday existence . God ! what would I forfeit to have the days of my childhood restored , or to be able to forget them for ever ! ’
26743	26752	26754	26755	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ You have seen much trouble , sir , ’
26758	26762	26764	26766	the dismal man	10022	‘ I have , ’
26769	26784	26764	26766	the dismal man	10022	‘ I have . More than those who see me now would believe possible . ’
26795	26817	26785	26785	He	10022	‘ Did it ever strike you , on such a morning as this , that drowning would be happiness and peace ? ’
26818	26825	26827	26828	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ God bless me , no ! ’
26860	26868	26870	26872	the dismal man	10022	‘ I have thought so , often , ’
26879	26944	26870	26872	the dismal man	10022	‘ The calm , cool water seems to me to murmur an invitation to repose and rest . A bound , a splash , a brief struggle ; there is an eddy for an instant , it gradually subsides into a gentle ripple ; the waters have closed above your head , and the world has closed upon your miseries and misfortunes for ever . ’
26974	27011	26966	26966	he	10022	‘ There -- enough of that . I wish to see you on another subject . You invited me to read that paper , the night before last , and listened attentively while I did so . ’
27012	27016	27018	27019	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I did , ’
27021	27026	27018	27019	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ and I certainly thought-- ’
27027	27034	27036	27038	the dismal man	10022	‘ I asked for no opinion , ’
27043	27102	27036	27038	the dismal man	10022	‘ and I want none . You are travelling for amusement and instruction . Suppose I forward you a curious manuscript -- observe , not curious because wild or improbable , but curious as a leaf from the romance of real life -- would you communicate it to the club , of which you have spoken so frequently ? ’
27103	27106	27108	27109	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Certainly , ’
27111	27126	27108	27109	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ if you wished it ; and it would be entered on their transactions . ’

27139	27143	27135	27137	the dismal man	10022	‘ Your address ; ’
27262	27269	27271	27272	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Now , about Manor Farm , ’
27274	27280	27271	27272	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ How shall we go ? ’
27281	27291	27293	27294	Mr. Tupman	244	‘ We had better consult the waiter , perhaps , ’
27303	27322	27297	27298	the waiter	9785	‘ Dingley Dell , gentlemen -- fifteen miles , gentlemen -- cross road -- post- chaise , sir ? ’
27323	27334	27336	27337	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Post - chaise wo n’t hold more than two , ’
27339	27383	27336	27337	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ True , sir -- beg your pardon , sir.--Very nice four - wheel chaise , sir-- seat for two behind -- one in front for the gentleman that drives -- oh ! beg your pardon , sir -- that’ll only hold three . ’
27384	27391	27393	27394	Mr. Snodgrass	242	‘ What ’s to be done ? ’
27396	27409	27411	27412	the waiter	9785	‘ Perhaps one of the gentlemen would like to ride , sir ? ’
27419	27439	27411	27412	the waiter	9785	‘ very good saddle - horses , sir -- any of Mr. Wardle ’s men coming to Rochester , bring ‘
27445	27446	27443	27443	Sir	9716	’ ‘
27451	27456	27457	27457	Winkle	276	’ said Mr. Pickwick . ‘
27465	27512	27457	27457	Winkle	276	’ Now Mr. Winkle did entertain considerable misgivings in the very lowest recesses of his own heart , relative to his equestrian skill ; but , as he would not have them even suspected , on any account , he at once replied with great hardihood , ‘
27523	27537	27515	27515	I	0	’ Mr. Winkle had rushed upon his fate ; there was no resource . ‘
27547	27552	27515	27515	I	0	’ said Mr. Pickwick . ‘
27558	27727	27556	27556	sir	9716	’ replied the waiter . The waiter retired ; the breakfast concluded ; and the travellers ascended to their respective bedrooms , to prepare a change of clothing , to take with them on their approaching expedition . Mr. Pickwick had made his preliminary arrangements , and was looking over the coffee - room blinds at the passengers in the street , when the waiter entered , and announced that the chaise was ready -- an announcement which the vehicle itself confirmed , by forthwith appearing before the coffee- room blinds aforesaid . It was a curious little green box on four wheels , with a low place like a wine - bin for two behind , and an elevated perch for one in front , drawn by an immense brown horse , displaying great symmetry of bone . An hostler stood near , holding by the bridle another immense horse -- apparently a near relative of the animal in the chaise -- ready saddled for Mr. Winkle . ‘
27732	27751	27753	27753	my	0	’ said Mr. Pickwick , as they stood upon the pavement while the coats were being put in . ‘
27767	27768	27761	27761	I	0	’ ‘
27776	27781	27771	27771	you	0	’ said Mr. Tupman . ‘
27785	27790	27791	27791	I	0	’ said Mr. Snodgrass . ‘
27793	27798	27791	27791	I	0	’ exclaimed Mr. Pickwick . ‘
27806	27811	27804	27804	Sir	9716	’ interposed the hostler . ‘
27826	27827	27828	27828	He	1542	’ ‘
27836	27841	27834	27834	he	1542	’ inquired Mr. Pickwick . ‘
27865	27907	27910	27911	shiny Villiam	300	’ The last recommendation was indisputable . Mr. Tupman and Mr. Snodgrass got into the bin ; Mr. Pickwick ascended to his perch , and deposited his feet on a floor - clothed shelf , erected beneath it for that purpose . ‘
27913	27922	27910	27911	shiny Villiam	300	’ said the hostler to the deputy hostler , ‘
27929	27965	27910	27911	shiny Villiam	300	’ Shiny Villiam’--so called , probably , from his sleek hair and oily countenance -- placed the reins in Mr. Pickwick ’s left hand ; and the upper hostler thrust a whip into his right . ‘
27970	27992	27910	27911	shiny Villiam	300	’ cried Mr. Pickwick , as the tall quadruped evinced a decided inclination to back into the coffee - room window . ‘
27997	28009	28011	28011	his	1546	’ echoed Mr. Tupman and Mr. Snodgrass , from the bin . ‘
28016	28023	28011	28011	his	1546	’ said the head hostler encouragingly ; ‘
28032	28052	28030	28030	Villiam	300	’ The deputy restrained the animal ’s impetuosity , and the principal ran to assist Mr. Winkle in mounting . ‘
28062	28063	28059	28059	you	9716	’ ‘
28072	28079	28081	28085	a grinning post - boy	1549	’ up on the wrong side , ’
28129	28133	28135	28136	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ All right ? ’
28148	28152	28154	28155	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ All right , ’
28158	28160	28161	28161	em	1552	‘ Let ‘
28164	28173	28161	28161	em	1552	’ cried the hostler.--‘Hold him in , sir ; ’
28218	28225	28227	28228	Mr. Snodgrass	242	‘ What makes him go sideways ? ’
28240	28246	28248	28249	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ I ca n’t imagine , ’
28420	28430	28432	28433	Mr. Snodgrass	242	‘ What _ can _ he mean by this ? ’
28447	28453	28455	28456	Mr. Tupman	244	‘ I do n’t know , ’
28458	28469	28455	28456	Mr. Tupman	244	‘ it looks very like shying , do n’t it ? ’
28488	28491	28493	28494	that gentleman	9760	‘ Woo ! ’
28496	28503	28493	28494	that gentleman	9760	‘ I have dropped my whip . ’
28504	28507	28509	28510	Mr. Snodgrass	242	‘ Winkle , ’
28550	28562	28563	28564	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ pick up the whip , there ’s a good fellow . ’
28714	28718	28720	28721	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ Poor fellow , ’
28729	28731	28720	28721	Mr. Winkle	276	’ The ‘
28734	28829	28720	28721	Mr. Winkle	276	’ was proof against flattery ; the more Mr. Winkle tried to get nearer him , the more he sidled away ; and , notwithstanding all kinds of coaxing and wheedling , there were Mr. Winkle and the horse going round and round each other for ten minutes , at the end of which time each was at precisely the same distance from the other as when they first commenced -- an unsatisfactory sort of thing under any circumstances , but particularly so in a lonely road , where no assistance can be procured . ‘
28836	28852	28832	28832	I	0	’ shouted Mr. Winkle , after the dodging had been prolonged for a considerable time . ‘
28866	28867	28859	28859	I	0	’ ‘
28880	28888	28868	28868	You	0	’ replied Mr. Pickwick from the chaise . ‘
28895	28900	28859	28859	I	0	’ roared Mr. Winkle . ‘
28907	29162	28859	28859	I	0	’ Mr. Pickwick was the very personation of kindness and humanity : he threw the reins on the horse ’s back , and having descended from his seat , carefully drew the chaise into the hedge , lest anything should come along the road , and stepped back to the assistance of his distressed companion , leaving Mr. Tupman and Mr. Snodgrass in the vehicle . The horse no sooner beheld Mr. Pickwick advancing towards him with the chaise whip in his hand , than he exchanged the rotary motion in which he had previously indulged , for a retrograde movement of so very determined a character , that it at once drew Mr. Winkle , who was still at the end of the bridle , at a rather quicker rate than fast walking , in the direction from which they had just come . Mr. Pickwick ran to his assistance , but the faster Mr. Pickwick ran forward , the faster the horse ran backward . There was a great scraping of feet , and kicking up of the dust ; and at last Mr. Winkle , his arms being nearly pulled out of their sockets , fairly let go his hold . The horse paused , stared , shook his head , turned round , and quietly trotted home to Rochester , leaving Mr. Winkle and Mr. Pickwick gazing on each other with countenances of blank dismay . A rattling noise at a little distance attracted their attention . They looked up . ‘
29167	29174	28859	28859	I	0	’ exclaimed the agonised Mr. Pickwick ; ‘
29183	29469	28859	28859	I	0	’ It was but too true . The animal was startled by the noise , and the reins were on his back . The results may be guessed . He tore off with the four- wheeled chaise behind him , and Mr. Tupman and Mr. Snodgrass in the four- wheeled chaise . The heat was a short one . Mr. Tupman threw himself into the hedge , Mr. Snodgrass followed his example , the horse dashed the four -- wheeled chaise against a wooden bridge , separated the wheels from the body , and the bin from the perch ; and finally stood stock still to gaze upon the ruin he had made . The first care of the two unspilt friends was to extricate their unfortunate companions from their bed of quickset -- a process which gave them the unspeakable satisfaction of discovering that they had sustained no injury , beyond sundry rents in their garments , and various lacerations from the brambles . The next thing to be done was to unharness the horse . This complicated process having been effected , the party walked slowly forward , leading the horse among them , and abandoning the chaise to its fate . An hour ’s walk brought the travellers to a little road - side public- house , with two elm - trees , a horse trough , and a signpost , in front ; one or two deformed hay - ricks behind , a kitchen garden at the side , and rotten sheds and mouldering outhouses jumbled in strange confusion all about it . A red - headed man was working in the garden ; and to him Mr. Pickwick called lustily , ‘
29473	29504	29505	29505	Hollo	303	’ The red - headed man raised his body , shaded his eyes with his hand , and stared , long and coolly , at Mr. Pickwick and his companions . ‘
29508	29513	29514	29514	Hollo	303	’ repeated Mr. Pickwick . ‘
29516	29526	29514	29514	Hollo	303	’ was the red - headed man ’s reply . ‘
29535	29536	29514	29514	Hollo	303	’ ‘
29542	29543	29514	29514	Hollo	303	’ ‘
29550	29551	29514	29514	Hollo	303	’ ‘
29554	29557	29514	29514	Hollo	303	‘ tain’t . ’
29581	29591	29593	29594	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ We want to put this horse up here , ’
29596	29606	29593	29594	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I suppose we can , ca n’t we ? ’
29618	29631	29514	29514	Hollo	303	’ repeated the red - headed man , leaning on his spade . ‘
29635	29656	29514	29514	Hollo	303	’ replied Mr. Pickwick , who had by this time advanced , horse in hand , to the garden rails . ‘
29678	29716	29658	29676	the man with the red head , emerging from the garden , and looking very hard at the horse--‘missus	1571	’ A tall , bony woman -- straight all the way down -- in a coarse , blue pelisse , with the waist an inch or two below her arm - pits , responded to the call . ‘
29729	29766	29725	29727	my good woman	1573	’ said Mr. Tupman , advancing , and speaking in his most seductive tones . The woman looked very hard at the whole party ; and the red - headed man whispered something in her ear . ‘
29769	29779	29780	29780	I	0	’ replied the woman , after a little consideration , ‘
29781	29786	29815	29816	the woman	1298	’m afeerd on it . ’
29787	29790	29792	29793	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Afraid ! ’
29795	29803	29792	29793	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ what ’s the woman afraid of ? ’
29804	29813	29815	29816	the woman	1298	‘ It got us in trouble last time , ’
29823	29831	29815	29816	the woman	1298	‘ I woan’t have nothin’ to say to ‘
29834	29835	29815	29816	the woman	1298	’ ‘
29848	29855	29856	29856	I	0	’ said the astonished Mr. Pickwick . ‘
29863	29875	29856	29856	I	0	’ whispered Mr. Winkle , as his friends gathered round him , ‘
29890	29891	29877	29877	they	1576	’ ‘
29894	29912	29877	29877	they	1576	’ exclaimed Mr. Pickwick , in a storm of indignation . Mr. Winkle modestly repeated his suggestion . ‘
29918	29925	29927	29927	you	1578	’ said the angry Mr. Pickwick , ‘
29934	29935	29936	29936	I	0	’ ‘
29937	29942	29944	29948	the red - headed man	10316	’m sure ye did , ’
29979	29986	29967	29967	he	10316	‘ It ’s like a dream , ’
29991	30018	29988	29989	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ a hideous dream . The idea of a man ’s walking about all day with a dreadful horse that he ca n’t get rid of ! ’
30241	30249	30251	30254	the hospitable old gentleman	1590	‘ Why , where have you been ? ’
30256	30338	30251	30254	the hospitable old gentleman	1590	‘ I ’ve been waiting for you all day . Well , you _ do _ look tired . What ! Scratches ! Not hurt , I hope -- eh ? Well , I _ am _ glad to hear that -- very . So you ’ve been spilt , eh ? Never mind . Common accident in these parts . Joe -- he ’s asleep again!--Joe , take that horse from the gentlemen , and lead it into the stable . ’
30384	30394	30396	30398	the old gentleman	10238	‘ We ’ll have you put to rights here , ’
30400	30445	30396	30398	the old gentleman	10238	‘ and then I ’ll introduce you to the people in the parlour . Emma , bring out the cherry brandy ; now , Jane , a needle and thread here ; towels and water , Mary . Come , girls , bustle about . ’
30529	30532	30534	30536	the old gentleman	10238	‘ Bustle ! ’
30737	30795	31371	31371	grandma	1611	‘ Loaded’--as it had been , on the same authority , for half a century at least . An old eight - day clock , of solemn and sedate demeanour , ticked gravely in one corner ; and a silver watch , of equal antiquity , dangled from one of the many hooks which ornamented the dresser . ‘
30798	30819	31371	31371	grandma	1611	’ said the old gentleman inquiringly , when his guests had been washed , mended , brushed , and brandied . ‘
30822	30827	31371	31371	grandma	1611	’ replied Mr. Pickwick . ‘
30833	30880	31371	31371	grandma	1611	’ and the party having traversed several dark passages , and being joined by Mr. Tupman , who had lingered behind to snatch a kiss from Emma , for which he had been duly rewarded with sundry pushings and scratchings , arrived at the parlour door . ‘
30883	30899	31371	31371	grandma	1611	’ said their hospitable host , throwing it open and stepping forward to announce them , ‘
30908	30922	31371	31371	grandma	1611	’ CHAPTER VI . AN OLD - FASHIONED CARD - PARTY -- THE CLERGYMAN ’S
30930	31327	31331	31331	mother	895	’S RETURN Several guests who were assembled in the old parlour rose to greet Mr. Pickwick and his friends upon their entrance ; and during the performance of the ceremony of introduction , with all due formalities , Mr. Pickwick had leisure to observe the appearance , and speculate upon the characters and pursuits , of the persons by whom he was surrounded -- a habit in which he , in common with many other great men , delighted to indulge . A very old lady , in a lofty cap and faded silk gown -- no less a personage than Mr. Wardle ’s mother -- occupied the post of honour on the right - hand corner of the chimney - piece ; and various certificates of her having been brought up in the way she should go when young , and of her not having departed from it when old , ornamented the walls , in the form of samplers of ancient date , worsted landscapes of equal antiquity , and crimson silk tea - kettle holders of a more modern period . The aunt , the two young ladies , and Mr. Wardle , each vying with the other in paying zealous and unremitting attentions to the old lady , crowded round her easy - chair , one holding her ear - trumpet , another an orange , and a third a smelling- bottle , while a fourth was busily engaged in patting and punching the pillows which were arranged for her support . On the opposite side sat a bald - headed old gentleman , with a good - humoured , benevolent face -- the clergyman of Dingley Dell ; and next him sat his wife , a stout , blooming old lady , who looked as if she were well skilled , not only in the art and mystery of manufacturing home - made cordials greatly to other people ’s satisfaction , but of tasting them occasionally very much to her own . A little hard - headed , Ripstone pippin - faced man , was conversing with a fat old gentleman in one corner ; and two or three more old gentlemen , and two or three more old ladies , sat bolt upright and motionless on their chairs , staring very hard at Mr. Pickwick and his fellow - voyagers . ‘
31333	31346	31331	31331	mother	895	’ said Mr. Wardle , at the very top of his voice . ‘
31349	31359	31331	31331	mother	895	’ said the old lady , shaking her head ; ‘
31366	31367	31364	31364	you	240	’ ‘
31373	31381	31371	31371	grandma	1611	’ screamed both the young ladies together . ‘
31384	31390	31371	31371	grandma	1611	’ exclaimed the old lady . ‘
31406	31415	31371	31371	grandma	1611	‘ ooman like me , I dare say . ’
31416	31423	31425	31426	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I assure you , ma’am , ’
31483	31484	31514	31514	him	240	’ ‘
31487	31498	31514	31514	him	240	’ said the old lady , after a short pause : ‘
31516	31517	31510	31510	I	0	’ ‘
31525	31536	31518	31518	Grandma	309	’ said Miss Isabella Wardle , in a low tone ; ‘
31545	31572	31538	31538	she	309	’ Mr. Pickwick nodded his readiness to humour the infirmities of age , and entered into a general conversation with the other members of the circle . ‘
31577	31582	31538	31538	she	309	’ said Mr. Pickwick . ‘
31585	31595	31653	31657	The hard - headed man	1617	’ echoed Messrs. Snodgrass , Tupman , and Winkle . ‘
31603	31608	31598	31598	I	0	’ said Mr. Wardle . ‘
31616	31624	31626	31634	the hard- headed man with the pippin -- face	1616	’ ground in all Kent , sir , ’
31636	31652	31626	31634	the hard- headed man with the pippin -- face	1616	‘ there ai n’t indeed , sir -- I’m sure there ai n’t , Sir . ’
31683	31691	31664	31664	he	1617	‘ There ai n’t a better spot o ’
31697	31710	31664	31664	he	1617	’ said the hard - headed man again , after a pause . ‘
31711	31717	31719	31721	the fat man	1619	’ Cept Mullins ’s Meadows , ’
31724	31729	31731	31732	the other	1197	‘ Mullins ’s Meadows ! ’
31738	31745	31747	31749	the fat man	1619	‘ Ah , Mullins ’s Meadows , ’
31751	31757	31759	31761	another fat man	1622	‘ Reg’lar good land that , ’
31763	31773	31775	31778	a third fat man	1623	‘ And so it is , sure - ly , ’
31780	31785	31787	31789	the corpulent host	1624	‘ Everybody knows that , ’
31816	31823	31847	31847	she	1626	‘ What are they talking about ? ’
31864	31871	31847	31847	she	1626	‘ About the land , grandma . ’
31872	31883	31847	31847	she	1626	‘ What about the land?--Nothing the matter , is there ? ’
31884	31902	31939	31941	the old lady	10352	‘ No , no . Mr. Miller was saying our land was better than Mullins ’s Meadows . ’
31903	31912	31914	31916	the old lady	10352	‘ How should he know anything about it ? ’
31919	31935	31914	31916	the old lady	10352	‘ Miller ’s a conceited coxcomb , and you may tell him I said so . ’
31968	31973	31975	31977	the bustling host	1633	‘ Come , come , ’
31988	31999	31975	31977	the bustling host	1633	‘ what say you to a rubber , Mr. Pickwick ? ’
32000	32009	32011	32012	that gentleman	9760	‘ I should like it of all things , ’
32014	32026	32011	32012	that gentleman	9760	‘ but pray do n’t make up one on my account . ’
32027	32042	32044	32045	Mr. Wardle	292	‘ Oh , I assure you , mother ’s very fond of a rubber , ’
32047	32054	32044	32045	Mr. Wardle	292	‘ ai n’t you , mother ? ’
32077	32082	32084	32085	the gentleman	883	‘ Joe , Joe ! ’

32202	32290	32346	32346	he	312	’ has been very irreverently and ignominiously applied . The round - game table , on the other hand , was so boisterously merry as materially to interrupt the contemplations of Mr. Miller , who , not being quite so much absorbed as he ought to have been , contrived to commit various high crimes and misdemeanours , which excited the wrath of the fat gentleman to a very great extent , and called forth the good - humour of the old lady in a proportionate degree . ‘
32293	32314	32346	32346	he	312	’ said the criminal Miller triumphantly , as he took up the odd trick at the conclusion of a hand ; ‘
32334	32335	32336	32336	Miller	312	’ ‘
32350	32361	32346	32346	he	312	’ said the old lady . Mr. Pickwick nodded assent . ‘
32367	32380	32363	32363	I	0	’ said the unfortunate , with a doubtful appeal to his partner . ‘
32386	32397	32384	32384	Sir	9716	’ said the fat gentleman , in an awful voice . ‘
32401	32407	32384	32384	Sir	9716	’ said the crestfallen Miller . ‘
32412	32418	32384	32384	Sir	9716	’ growled the fat gentleman . ‘
32427	32432	32384	32384	Sir	9716	’ said Mr. Pickwick . ‘
32436	32441	32443	32445	the old lady	10352	‘ Can you one ? ’
32447	32451	32453	32454	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I can , ’
32456	32465	32453	32454	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Double , single , and the rub . ’
32466	32472	32474	32475	Mr. Miller	312	‘ Never was such luck , ’
32477	32483	32485	32487	the fat gentleman	1640	‘ Never was such cards , ’
32512	32516	32518	32520	the old lady	10352	‘ Another double , ’
32542	32548	32550	32551	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ A double , sir , ’
32553	32562	32564	32566	the fat gentleman	1640	‘ Quite aware of the fact , Sir , ’
32709	32713	32715	32716	Emily Wardle	294	‘ went partners , ’
32864	32867	32860	32862	the spinster aunt	1474	‘ matrimony , ’
33189	33193	33195	33197	the hospitable host	1683	‘ Now this , ’
33301	33344	33299	33299	mother	895	’ The tear which starts unbidden to the eye when the recollection of old times and the happiness of many years ago is suddenly recalled , stole down the old lady ’s face as she shook her head with a melancholy smile . ‘
33358	33368	33355	33356	Mr. Pickwick	240	’ resumed the host , after a short pause , ‘
33432	33433	33422	33423	Mr. Snodgrass	242	’ ‘
33439	33459	33437	33437	you	242	’ replied that gentleman , whose poetic curiosity had been greatly excited by the last observation of his entertainer . ‘
33476	33477	33466	33466	you	242	’ ‘
33487	33503	33478	33478	You	242	’ said the host knowingly , indicating the clergyman by a nod of his head . ‘
33519	33524	33513	33513	you	242	’ said Mr. Snodgrass . ‘
33529	33534	33513	33513	you	242	’ replied the clergyman , ‘
33581	33615	33618	33618	them	1699	’ A murmur of curiosity was of course the reply ; and the old gentleman proceeded to recite , with the aid of sundry promptings from his wife , the lines in question . ‘
33620	33930	33618	33618	them	1699	’ said he , THE IVY GREEN Oh , a dainty plant is the Ivy green , That creepeth o’er ruins old ! Of right choice food are his meals , I ween , In his cell so lone and cold . The wall must be crumbled , the stone decayed , To pleasure his dainty whim ; And the mouldering dust that years have made , Is a merry meal for him . Creeping where no life is seen , A rare old plant is the Ivy green . Fast he stealeth on , though he wears no wings , And a staunch old heart has he . How closely he twineth , how tight he clings To his friend the huge Oak Tree ! And slily he traileth along the ground , And his leaves he gently waves , As he joyously hugs and crawleth round The rich mould of dead men ’s graves . Creeping where grim death has been , A rare old plant is the Ivy green . Whole ages have fled and their works decayed , And nations have scattered been ; But the stout old Ivy shall never fade , From its hale and hearty green . The brave old plant in its lonely days , Shall fatten upon the past ; For the stateliest building man can raise , Is the Ivy ’s food at last . Creeping on where time has been , A rare old plant is the Ivy green . While the old gentleman repeated these lines a second time , to enable Mr. Snodgrass to note them down , Mr. Pickwick perused the lineaments of his face with an expression of great interest . The old gentleman having concluded his dictation , and Mr. Snodgrass having returned his note - book to his pocket , Mr. Pickwick said-- ‘
33982	33983	33984	33984	I	0	’ ‘
33990	33996	33984	33984	I	0	’ replied the old gentleman , ‘
34020	34021	34022	34022	You	0	’ ‘
34039	34086	34036	34036	you	0	’ inquired Mr. Wardle , who appeared very desirous to draw his friend out , for the edification of his new visitors . The old gentleman slightly nodded his head in token of assent , and was proceeding to change the subject , when Mr. Pickwick said-- ‘
34109	34110	34106	34107	John Edmunds	315	’ ‘
34120	34126	34114	34114	I	0	’ said Mr. Snodgrass eagerly . ‘
34134	34140	34127	34127	You	0	’ said the jolly host . ‘
34171	34290	34155	34155	you	0	’ The old gentleman smiled good - humouredly as he drew his chair forward-- the remainder of the party drew their chairs closer together , especially Mr. Tupman and the spinster aunt , who were possibly rather hard of hearing ; and the old lady ’s ear - trumpet having been duly adjusted , and Mr. Miller ( who had fallen asleep during the recital of the verses ) roused from his slumbers by an admonitory pinch , administered beneath the table by his ex - partner the solemn fat man , the old gentleman , without further preface , commenced the following tale , to which we have taken the liberty of prefixing the title of THE CONVICT ’S
34292	34301	34303	34305	the old gentleman	10238	‘ When I first settled in this village , ’
34307	34430	34303	34305	the old gentleman	10238	‘ which is now just five - and - twenty years ago , the most notorious person among my parishioners was a man of the name of Edmunds , who leased a small farm near this spot . He was a morose , savage - hearted , bad man ; idle and dissolute in his habits ; cruel and ferocious in his disposition . Beyond the few lazy and reckless vagabonds with whom he sauntered away his time in the fields , or sotted in the ale - house , he had not a single friend or acquaintance ; no one cared to speak to the man whom many feared , and every one detested -- and Edmunds was shunned by all . ‘
34614	34743	34583	34583	he	835	‘ They were poor -- they could not be otherwise when the man pursued such courses ; but the woman ’s unceasing and unwearied exertions , early and late , morning , noon , and night , kept them above actual want . These exertions were but ill repaid . People who passed the spot in the evening -- sometimes at a late hour of the night -- reported that they had heard the moans and sobs of a woman in distress , and the sound of blows ; and more than once , when it was past midnight , the boy knocked softly at the door of a neighbour ’s house , whither he had been sent , to escape the drunken fury of his unnatural father . ‘
34943	35151	34927	34927	she	10054	‘ Five or six years passed away ; the boy had become a robust and well- grown youth . The time that had strengthened the child ’s slight frame and knit his weak limbs into the strength of manhood had bowed his mother ’s form , and enfeebled her steps ; but the arm that should have supported her was no longer locked in hers ; the face that should have cheered her , no more looked upon her own . She occupied her old seat , but there was a vacant one beside her . The Bible was kept as carefully as ever , the places were found and folded down as they used to be : but there was no one to read it with her ; and the tears fell thick and fast upon the book , and blotted the words from her eyes . Neighbours were as kind as they were wo nt to be of old , but she shunned their greetings with averted head . There was no lingering among the old elm - trees now -- no cheering anticipations of happiness yet in store . The desolate woman drew her bonnet closer over her face , and walked hurriedly away . ‘
35305	35388	35395	35396	a woman	1019	‘ The measure of the unhappy woman ’s misery and misfortune was about to be completed . Numerous offences had been committed in the neighbourhood ; the perpetrators remained undiscovered , and their boldness increased . A robbery of a daring and aggravated nature occasioned a vigilance of pursuit , and a strictness of search , they had not calculated on . Young Edmunds was suspected , with three companions . He was apprehended-- committed -- tried -- condemned -- to die . ‘
35493	35598	35487	35487	he	872	‘ In the first transports of her mental anguish , the suffering mother threw herself on her knees at my feet , and fervently sought the Almighty Being who had hitherto supported her in all her troubles to release her from a world of woe and misery , and to spare the life of her only child . A burst of grief , and a violent struggle , such as I hope I may never have to witness again , succeeded . I knew that her heart was breaking from that hour ; but I never once heard complaint or murmur escape her lips . ‘
35679	35737	35676	35676	his	1747	‘ But the spirit of resignation and endurance that had so long upheld her , was unable to contend against bodily weakness and infirmity . She fell sick . She dragged her tottering limbs from the bed to visit her son once more , but her strength failed her , and she sank powerless on the ground . ‘
35987	36074	36075	36075	He	1757	‘ I bore the mother ’s forgiveness and blessing to her son in prison ; and I carried the solemn assurance of repentance , and his fervent supplication for pardon , to her sick - bed . I heard , with pity and compassion , the repentant man devise a thousand little plans for her comfort and support when he returned ; but I knew that many months before he could reach his place of destination , his mother would be no longer of this world . ‘
36149	36264	36265	36265	Edmunds	318	‘ It had been arranged previously to the convict ’s departure , that he should write to his mother as soon as he could obtain permission , and that the letter should be addressed to me . The father had positively refused to see his son from the moment of his apprehension ; and it was a matter of indifference to him whether he lived or died . Many years passed over without any intelligence of him ; and when more than half his term of transportation had expired , and I had received no letter , I concluded him to be dead , as , indeed , I almost hoped he might be . ‘
36368	36610	36611	36611	He	1768	‘ On a fine Sunday evening , in the month of August , John Edmunds set foot in the village he had left with shame and disgrace seventeen years before . His nearest way lay through the churchyard . The man ’s heart swelled as he crossed the stile . The tall old elms , through whose branches the declining sun cast here and there a rich ray of light upon the shady part , awakened the associations of his earliest days . He pictured himself as he was then , clinging to his mother ’s hand , and walking peacefully to church . He remembered how he used to look up into her pale face ; and how her eyes would sometimes fill with tears as she gazed upon his features -- tears which fell hot upon his forehead as she stooped to kiss him , and made him weep too , although he little knew then what bitter tears hers were . He thought how often he had run merrily down that path with some childish playfellow , looking back , ever and again , to catch his mother ’s smile , or hear her gentle voice ; and then a veil seemed lifted from his memory , and words of kindness unrequited , and warnings despised , and promises broken , thronged upon his recollection till his heart failed him , and he could bear it no longer . ‘
36804	36849	36854	36854	his	1779	‘ An old man entered the porch just as he reached it . Edmunds started back , for he knew him well ; many a time he had watched him digging graves in the churchyard . What would he say to the returned convict ? ‘
36879	37039	36874	36874	He	1779	‘ He walked down the hill , and through the village . The weather was warm , and the people were sitting at their doors , or strolling in their little gardens as he passed , enjoying the serenity of the evening , and their rest from labour . Many a look was turned towards him , and many a doubtful glance he cast on either side to see whether any knew and shunned him . There were strange faces in almost every house ; in some he recognised the burly form of some old schoolfellow -- a boy when he last saw him -- surrounded by a troop of merry children ; in others he saw , seated in an easy - chair at a cottage door , a feeble and infirm old man , whom he only remembered as a hale and hearty labourer ; but they had all forgotten him , and he passed on unknown . ‘
37384	37462	37463	37463	He	835	‘ And such was the return to which he had looked through the weary perspective of many years , and for which he had undergone so much suffering ! No face of welcome , no look of forgiveness , no house to receive , no hand to help him -- and this too in the old village . What was his loneliness in the wild , thick woods , where man was never seen , to this ! ‘
37580	37619	37620	37621	The man	835	‘ He had not observed that a man was lying on the bank beside him ; his garments rustled as he turned round to steal a look at the new - comer ; and Edmunds raised his head . ‘
37759	37791	37751	37751	They	1808	‘ The old man was ghastly pale . He shuddered and tottered to his feet . Edmunds sprang to his . He stepped back a pace or two . Edmunds advanced . ‘
37811	37834	37801	37802	the convict	1609	‘ “ Stand off ! ” cried the old man , with a dreadful oath . The convict drew closer to him . ‘
37864	37908	37909	37911	The old man	1779	‘ “ Father -- devil ! ” murmured the convict between his set teeth . He rushed wildly forward , and clenched the old man by the throat -- but he was his father ; and his arm fell powerless by his side . ‘
37981	37989	37991	37993	the old gentleman	10238	‘ In that corner of the churchyard , ’
38003	38078	37991	37993	the old gentleman	10238	‘ in that corner of the churchyard of which I have before spoken , there lies buried a man who was in my employment for three years after this event , and who was truly contrite , penitent , and humbled , if ever man was . No one save myself knew in that man ’s lifetime who he was , or whence he came -- it was John Edmunds , the returned convict . ’
38224	38230	38237	38237	he	1824	‘ Pleasant , pleasant country , ’
38243	38325	38237	38237	he	1824	‘ Who could live to gaze from day to day on bricks and slates who had once felt the influence of a scene like this ? Who could continue to exist where there are no cows but the cows on the chimney - pots ; nothing redolent of Pan but pan - tiles ; no crop but stone crop ? Who could bear to drag out a life in such a spot ? Who , I ask , could endure it ? ’
38438	38441	38460	38460	his	240	‘ Hollo ! ’
38510	38515	38527	38527	his	1830	‘ How are you ? ’
38533	38563	38527	38527	his	1830	’Beautiful morning , ai n’t it ? Glad to see you up so early . Make haste down , and come out . I ’ll wait for you here . ’
38597	38600	38602	38603	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Hollo ! ’
38627	38633	38602	38603	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ what ’s going forward ? ’
38634	38642	38644	38645	the host	10403	‘ Why , your friend and I , ’
38647	38668	38644	38645	the host	10403	‘ are going out rook - shooting before breakfast . He ’s a very good shot , ai n’t he ? ’
38669	38681	38683	38684	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I ’ve heard him say he ’s a capital one , ’
38686	38696	38683	38684	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ but I never saw him aim at anything . ’
38697	38700	38702	38703	the host	10403	‘ Well , ’
38705	38716	38702	38703	the host	10403	‘ I wish he ’d come . Joe -- Joe ! ’
38748	38781	38782	38783	The boy	1304	‘ Go up , and call the gentleman , and tell him he ’ll find me and Mr. Pickwick in the rookery . Show the gentleman the way there ; d’ye hear ? ’
38810	38816	38818	38820	the old gentleman	10238	‘ This is the place , ’
38868	38873	38875	38876	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Here they are , ’
38935	38939	38941	38943	the old gentleman	10238	‘ Come along , ’
38949	38971	38941	38943	the old gentleman	10238	‘ a keen hand like you ought to have been up long ago , even to such poor work as this . ’
39059	39066	39068	39069	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ What are these lads for ? ’
39128	39135	39137	39138	Mr. Wardle	292	‘ Only to start the game , ’
39142	39146	39148	39149	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ To what ? ’
39151	39163	39148	39149	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Why , in plain English , to frighten the rooks . ’
39164	39171	39148	39149	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Oh , is that all ? ’
39172	39177	39148	39149	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ You are satisfied ? ’
39178	39181	39148	39149	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Quite . ’
39182	39190	39148	39149	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Very well . Shall I begin ? ’
39191	39196	39198	39199	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ If you please , ’
39206	39216	39217	39218	The boy	1304	‘ Stand aside , then . Now for it . ’
39269	39276	39278	39280	the old gentleman	10238	‘ Take him up , Joe , ’
39321	39327	39329	39330	the host	10403	‘ Now , Mr. Winkle , ’
39337	39341	39329	39330	the host	10403	‘ Fire away . ’
39402	39405	39407	39409	the old gentleman	10238	‘ Hollo ! ’
39411	39417	39419	39420	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Wo n’t it go ? ’
39422	39426	39428	39429	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ Missed fire , ’
39440	39443	39445	39447	the old gentleman	10238	‘ Odd , ’
39453	39474	39445	39447	the old gentleman	10238	‘ Never knew one of them miss fire before . Why , I do n’t see anything of the cap . ’
39479	39484	39445	39447	the old gentleman	10238	’ said Mr. Winkle , ‘
39492	39602	39487	39487	I	0	’ The slight omission was rectified . Mr. Pickwick crouched again . Mr. Winkle stepped forward with an air of determination and resolution ; and Mr. Tupman looked out from behind a tree . The boy shouted ; four birds flew out . Mr. Winkle fired . There was a scream as of an individual -- not a rook -- in corporal anguish . Mr. Tupman had saved the lives of innumerable unoffending birds by receiving a portion of the charge in his left arm . To describe the confusion that ensued would be impossible . To tell how Mr. Pickwick in the first transports of emotion called Mr. Winkle ‘
39605	39748	39770	39770	They	1863	’ how Mr. Tupman lay prostrate on the ground ; and how Mr. Winkle knelt horror - stricken beside him ; how Mr. Tupman called distractedly upon some feminine Christian name , and then opened first one eye , and then the other , and then fell back and shut them both -- all this would be as difficult to describe in detail , as it would be to depict the gradual recovering of the unfortunate individual , the binding up of his arm with pocket - handkerchiefs , and the conveying him back by slow degrees supported by the arms of his anxious friends . They drew near the house . The ladies were at the garden gate , waiting for their arrival and their breakfast . The spinster aunt appeared ; she smiled , and beckoned them to walk quicker . ‘
39774	39787	39789	39790	Isabella Wardle	295	‘ Why , what is the matter with the little old gentleman ? ’
39826	39832	39835	39837	the old host	1866	‘ Do n’t be frightened , ’
39869	39875	39877	39878	the host	10403	‘ Do n’t be frightened , ’
39880	39886	39888	39889	the ladies	10146	‘ What ’s the matter ? ’
39891	39905	39888	39889	the ladies	10146	‘ Mr. Tupman has met with a little accident ; that ’s all . ’
39930	39938	39940	39942	the old gentleman	10238	‘ Throw some cold water over her , ’
39944	39949	39951	39953	the spinster aunt	1474	‘ No , no , ’
39955	39981	39951	39953	the spinster aunt	1474	‘ I am better now . Bella , Emily -- a surgeon ! Is he wounded?--Is he dead?--Is he -- Ha , ha , ha ! ’
39999	40003	40005	40006	Mr. Tupman	244	‘ Calm yourself , ’
40021	40030	40005	40006	Mr. Tupman	244	‘ Dear , dear madam , calm yourself . ’
40031	40037	40039	40041	the spinster aunt	1474	‘ It is his voice ! ’
40054	40067	40069	40070	Mr. Tupman	244	‘ Do not agitate yourself , I entreat you , dearest madam , ’
40073	40084	40069	40070	Mr. Tupman	244	‘ I am very little hurt , I assure you . ’
40085	40092	40094	40096	the hysterical lady	1878	‘ Then you are not dead ! ’
40098	40107	40094	40096	the hysterical lady	1878	‘ Oh , say you are not dead ! ’
40108	40117	40119	40120	Mr. Wardle	292	‘ Do n’t be a fool , Rachael , ’
40136	40151	40119	40120	Mr. Wardle	292	‘ What the devil ’s the use of his saying he is n’t dead ? ’
40152	40161	40163	40164	Mr. Tupman	244	‘ No , no , I am not , ’
40166	40181	40182	40182	He	244	‘ I require no assistance but yours . Let me lean on your arm . ’
40189	40195	40182	40182	He	244	‘ Oh , Miss Rachael ! ’
40230	40235	40239	40239	Rachael	289	‘ Are you faint ? ’

40324	40329	40318	40318	you	244	’ she said bashfully . ‘
40337	40342	40361	40362	the lady	10556	’ replied Mr. Tupman ; ‘
40356	40359	40361	40362	the lady	10556	’ Hush ! ’
40364	40368	40361	40362	the lady	10556	‘ My brother . ’
40473	40479	40481	40482	Mr. Wardle	292	‘ Are you a cricketer ? ’

40528	40536	40538	40539	the host	10403	‘ I was once upon a time , ’
40541	40563	40538	40539	the host	10403	‘ but I have given it up now . I subscribe to the club here , but I do n’t play . ’
40564	40577	40579	40580	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ The grand match is played to - day , I believe , ’
40582	40586	40588	40589	the host	10403	‘ It is , ’
40591	40601	40588	40589	the host	10403	‘ Of course you would like to see it . ’
40602	40607	40609	40610	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I , sir , ’
40612	40641	40609	40610	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ am delighted to view any sports which may be safely indulged in , and in which the impotent effects of unskilful people do not endanger human life . ’

40694	40704	40706	40707	Mr. Tupman	244	‘ You can not leave me in better hands , ’
40709	40713	40706	40707	Mr. Tupman	244	‘ Quite impossible , ’
41467	41475	41501	41501	his	240	‘ How - are - you ’s ? ’
41537	41551	41593	41595	another stout gentleman	1958	‘ You had better step into the marquee , I think , Sir , ’
41581	41591	41593	41595	another stout gentleman	1958	‘ You ’ll find it much pleasanter , Sir , ’
41610	41612	41593	41595	another stout gentleman	1958	‘ You ’re
41616	41621	41593	41595	another stout gentleman	1958	’ said Mr. Pickwick . ‘
41625	41631	41632	41632	they	1959	’ said the first speaker ; ‘
41647	41662	41632	41632	they	1959	’ and the cricketer , panting on before , preceded them to the tent . ‘
41674	41798	41632	41632	they	1959	’ were the words which fell upon Mr. Pickwick ’s ear as he entered the tent ; and the first object that met his eyes was his green - coated friend of the Rochester coach , holding forth , to the no small delight and edification of a select circle of the chosen of All - Muggleton . His dress was slightly improved , and he wore boots ; but there was no mistaking him . The stranger recognised his friends immediately ; and , darting forward and seizing Mr. Pickwick by the hand , dragged him to a seat with his usual impetuosity , talking all the while as if the whole of the arrangements were under his especial patronage and direction . ‘
41845	41879	41880	41881	Mr. Wardle	292	’ Mr. Pickwick sat down as he was bid , and Mr. Winkle and Mr. Snodgrass also complied with the directions of their mysterious friend . Mr. Wardle looked on in silent wonder . ‘
41888	41893	41883	41886	a friend of mine	1963	’ said Mr. Pickwick . ‘
41968	41977	41979	41980	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Well ; and how came you here ? ’
41992	41995	41997	42000	the stranger--‘stopping at Crown	1967	‘ Come , ’
42025	42199	41979	41980	Mr. Pickwick	240	’ Mr. Pickwick was sufficiently versed in the stranger ’s system of stenography to infer from this rapid and disjointed communication that he had , somehow or other , contracted an acquaintance with the All- Muggletons , which he had converted , by a process peculiar to himself , into that extent of good - fellowship on which a general invitation may be easily founded . His curiosity was therefore satisfied , and putting on his spectacles he prepared himself to watch the play which was just commencing . All - Muggleton had the first innings ; and the interest became intense when Mr. Dumkins and Mr. Podder , two of the most renowned members of that most distinguished club , walked , bat in hand , to their respective wickets . Mr. Luffey , the highest ornament of Dingley Dell , was pitched to bowl against the redoubtable Dumkins , and Mr. Struggles was selected to do the same kind office for the hitherto unconquered Podder . Several players were stationed , to ‘
42203	42235	41979	41980	Mr. Pickwick	240	’ in different parts of the field , and each fixed himself into the proper attitude by placing one hand on each knee , and stooping very much as if he were ‘
42239	42339	41979	41980	Mr. Pickwick	240	’ for some beginner at leap - frog . All the regular players do this sort of thing;-- indeed it is generally supposed that it is quite impossible to look out properly in any other position . The umpires were stationed behind the wickets ; the scorers were prepared to notch the runs ; a breathless silence ensued . Mr. Luffey retired a few paces behind the wicket of the passive Podder , and applied the ball to his right eye for several seconds . Dumkins confidently awaited its coming with his eyes fixed on the motions of Luffey . ‘
42342	42406	41979	41980	Mr. Pickwick	240	’ suddenly cried the bowler . The ball flew from his hand straight and swift towards the centre stump of the wicket . The wary Dumkins was on the alert : it fell upon the tip of the bat , and bounded far away over the heads of the scouts , who had just stooped low enough to let it fly over them . ‘
42844	42855	42857	42858	the stranger	9737	‘ Capital game -- well played -- some strokes admirable , ’
42875	42883	42885	42886	Mr. Wardle	292	‘ You have played it , sir ? ’
42897	42922	42885	42886	Mr. Wardle	292	‘ Played it ! Think I have -- thousands of times -- not here -- West Indies-- exciting thing -- hot work -- very . ’
42923	42936	42938	42939	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ It must be rather a warm pursuit in such a climate , ’
42941	43086	42938	42939	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Warm!--red hot -- scorching -- glowing . Played a match once -- single wicket- -friend the colonel -- Sir Thomas Blazo -- who should get the greatest number of runs.--Won the toss -- first innings -- seven o’clock A.M.--six natives to look out -- went in ; kept in -- heat intense -- natives all fainted -- taken away -- fresh half - dozen ordered -- fainted also -- Blazo bowling -- supported by two natives -- couldn’t bowl me out -- fainted too-- cleared away the colonel -- wouldn’t give in -- faithful attendant -- Quanko Samba -- last man left -- sun so hot , bat in blisters , ball scorched brown-- five hundred and seventy runs -- rather exhausted -- Quanko mustered up last remaining strength -- bowled me out -- had a bath , and went out to dinner . ’
43087	43100	43102	43104	an old gentleman	1983	‘ And what became of what’s - his - name , Sir ? ’
43106	43109	43102	43104	an old gentleman	1983	‘ Blazo ? ’
43110	43117	42938	42939	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ No -- the other gentleman . ’
43121	43122	43125	43125	sir	9716	’ ‘
43127	43128	43125	43125	sir	9716	’ ‘
43154	43220	43152	43152	sir	9716	’ Here the stranger buried his countenance in a brown jug , but whether to hide his emotion or imbibe its contents , we can not distinctly affirm . We only know that he paused suddenly , drew a long and deep breath , and looked anxiously on , as two of the principal members of the Dingley Dell club approached Mr. Pickwick , and said-- ‘
43247	43251	43253	43254	Mr. Wardle	292	’ Of course , ’
43256	43264	43266	43266	he	292	‘ among our friends we include Mr.-- ; ’

43303	43314	43316	43317	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I shall be very happy , I am sure , ’
43319	43324	43326	43328	Mr. Alfred Jingle	256	‘ So shall I , ’
43356	43395	43346	43346	he	256	‘ Devilish good dinner -- cold , but capital -- peeped into the room this morning -- fowls and pies , and all that sort of thing -- pleasant fellows these -- well behaved , too -- very . ’
43552	43556	43548	43549	the waiters	2001	‘ clear away , ’

43704	43728	43729	43730	Mr. Jingle	256	‘ I wish to address a few words to you , Sir , if you will entreat the gentlemen to fill their glasses . ’

43792	43844	43786	43788	the little man	2005	‘ I wish to address what I have to say to you and not to our worthy chairman , because our worthy chairman is in some measure -- I may say in a great degree -- the subject of what I have to say , or I may say to -- to-- ’
43845	43848	43850	43851	Mr. Jingle	256	‘ State , ’
43853	43859	43861	43863	the little man	2005	‘ Yes , to state , ’
43865	44303	43861	43863	the little man	2005	‘ I thank my honourable friend , if he will allow me to call him so ( four hears and one certainly from Mr. Jingle ) , for the suggestion . Sir , I am a Deller -- a Dingley Deller ( cheers ) . I can not lay claim to the honour of forming an item in the population of Muggleton ; nor , Sir , I will frankly admit , do I covet that honour : and I will tell you why , Sir ( hear ) ; to Muggleton I will readily concede all these honours and distinctions to which it can fairly lay claim -- they are too numerous and too well known to require aid or recapitulation from me . But , sir , while we remember that Muggleton has given birth to a Dumkins and a Podder , let us never forget that Dingley Dell can boast a Luffey and a Struggles . ( Vociferous cheering . ) Let me not be considered as wishing to detract from the merits of the former gentlemen . Sir , I envy them the luxury of their own feelings on this occasion . ( Cheers . ) Every gentleman who hears me , is probably acquainted with the reply made by an individual , who -- to use an ordinary figure of speech--“hung out ” in a tub , to the emperor Alexander:--“if I were not Diogenes , ” said he , “ I would be Alexander . ” I can well imagine these gentlemen to say , “ If I were not Dumkins I would be Luffey ; if I were not Podder I would be Struggles . ” ( Enthusiasm . ) But , gentlemen of Muggleton , is it in cricket alone that your fellow - townsmen stand pre- eminent ? Have you never heard of Dumkins and determination ? Have you never been taught to associate Podder with property ? ( Great applause . ) Have you never , when struggling for your rights , your liberties , and your privileges , been reduced , if only for an instant , to misgiving and despair ? And when you have been thus depressed , has not the name of Dumkins laid afresh within your breast the fire which had just gone out ; and has not a word from that man lighted it again as brightly as if it had never expired ? ( Great cheering . ) Gentlemen , I beg to surround with a rich halo of enthusiastic cheering the united names of “ Dumkins and Podder . ” ’

45484	45512	45513	45513	Men	9795	’ Here Mr. Tupman paused , and pressed the hand which clasped the handle of the happy watering - pot . The lady turned aside her head . ‘
45518	45523	45513	45513	Men	9795	’ she softly whispered . ‘
45530	45535	45527	45527	they	9795	’ ejaculated Mr. Tupman ; ‘

45601	45606	45596	45598	such an individual	2048	’ said the lady . ‘
45615	45624	45625	45625	He	2048	’ said the ardent Mr. Tupman , interposing . ‘
45638	45660	45635	45636	Miss Wardle	289	’ And ere the lady was aware of his intention , Mr. Tupman had sunk upon his knees at her feet . ‘
45666	45670	45661	45662	Mr. Tupman	244	’ said Rachael . ‘
45673	45679	45635	45636	Miss Wardle	289	’ was the valorous reply . ‘
45684	45715	45635	45636	Miss Wardle	289	’ He seized her passive hand , and the watering - pot fell to the ground as he pressed it to his lips.--‘Oh , Rachael ! say you love me . ’
45716	45720	45722	45724	the spinster aunt	1474	‘ Mr. Tupman , ’
45730	45750	45722	45724	the spinster aunt	1474	‘ I can hardly speak the words ; but -- but -- you are not wholly indifferent to me . ’
45865	45875	45849	45850	the lady	10556	‘ Mr. Tupman , we are observed!--we are discovered ! ’

46644	46652	46642	46642	Sir	9716	’ inquired Emily , with great anxiety . ‘
46659	46664	46657	46657	ma’am	10369	’ replied the stranger . ‘
46689	46690	46685	46685	ma’am	10369	’ ‘
46697	46707	46685	46685	ma’am	10369	’ murmured Mr. Snodgrass , in a broken voice . ‘
46713	46730	46739	46739	ma’am	10369	’ ( Somehow or other , it never is the wine , in these cases . ) ‘
46741	46745	46746	46749	Two of the boys	2086	’ inquired Emma . ‘
46756	46757	46748	46749	the boys	2087	’ ‘
46765	46771	46758	46758	I	0	’ said Mr. Winkle firmly . ‘
46779	46793	46758	46758	I	0	’ said Mr. Pickwick stoutly ; and he went on smiling as before . ‘
46796	46802	46758	46758	I	0	’ gasped Mr. Winkle faintly . ‘
46805	46841	46758	46758	I	0	’ echoed Mr. Pickwick , taking off his hat and dashing it on the floor , and insanely casting his spectacles into the middle of the kitchen . At this humorous feat he laughed outright . ‘
46848	46896	46758	46758	I	0	’ cried Mr. Winkle , commencing in a very loud key , and ending in a very faint one . His head dropped upon his breast ; and , muttering his invincible determination not to go to his bed , and a sanguinary regret that he had not ‘
46901	47013	46758	46758	I	0	’ in the morning , he fell fast asleep ; in which condition he was borne to his apartment by two young giants under the personal superintendence of the fat boy , to whose protecting care Mr. Snodgrass shortly afterwards confided his own person , Mr. Pickwick accepted the proffered arm of Mr. Tupman and quietly disappeared , smiling more than ever ; and Mr. Wardle , after taking as affectionate a leave of the whole family as if he were ordered for immediate execution , consigned to Mr. Trundle the honour of conveying him upstairs , and retired , with a very futile attempt to look impressively solemn and dignified . ‘
47019	47025	46758	46758	I	0	’ said the spinster aunt . ‘
47030	47037	46758	46758	I	0	’ ejaculated both the young ladies . ‘
47042	47065	46758	46758	I	0	’ said Jingle , looking very grave : he was about a bottle and a half ahead of any of his companions . ‘
47070	47071	46758	46758	I	0	’ ‘
47077	47086	46758	46758	I	0	’ whispered the spinster aunt to Mr. Tupman . ‘
47093	47098	47318	47318	He	2092	’ whispered Emily Wardle . ‘
47103	47317	47318	47318	He	2092	’ observed the spinster aunt . Mr. Tupman thought of the widow at Rochester , and his mind was troubled . The succeeding half - hour ’s conversation was not of a nature to calm his perturbed spirit . The new visitor was very talkative , and the number of his anecdotes was only to be exceeded by the extent of his politeness . Mr. Tupman felt that as Jingle ’s popularity increased , he ( Tupman ) retired further into the shade . His laughter was forced -- his merriment feigned ; and when at last he laid his aching temples between the sheets , he thought , with horrid delight , on the satisfaction it would afford him to have Jingle ’s head at that moment between the feather bed and the mattress . The indefatigable stranger rose betimes next morning , and , although his companions remained in bed overpowered with the dissipation of the previous night , exerted himself most successfully to promote the hilarity of the breakfast - table . So successful were his efforts , that even the deaf old lady insisted on having one or two of his best jokes retailed through the trumpet ; and even she condescended to observe to the spinster aunt , that ‘
47319	47324	47326	47329	an impudent young fellow	2093	’ ( meaning Jingle ) ‘
47331	47682	47683	47683	Missus	2094	’ a sentiment in which all her relations then and there present thoroughly coincided . It was the old lady ’s habit on the fine summer mornings to repair to the arbour in which Mr. Tupman had already signalised himself , in form and manner following : first , the fat boy fetched from a peg behind the old lady ’s bedroom door , a close black satin bonnet , a warm cotton shawl , and a thick stick with a capacious handle ; and the old lady , having put on the bonnet and shawl at her leisure , would lean one hand on the stick and the other on the fat boy ’s shoulder , and walk leisurely to the arbour , where the fat boy would leave her to enjoy the fresh air for the space of half an hour ; at the expiration of which time he would return and reconduct her to the house . The old lady was very precise and very particular ; and as this ceremony had been observed for three successive summers without the slightest deviation from the accustomed form , she was not a little surprised on this particular morning to see the fat boy , instead of leaving the arbour , walk a few paces out of it , look carefully round him in every direction , and return towards her with great stealth and an air of the most profound mystery . The old lady was timorous -- most old ladies are -- and her first impression was that the bloated lad was about to do her some grievous bodily harm with the view of possessing himself of her loose coin . She would have cried for assistance , but age and infirmity had long ago deprived her of the power of screaming ; she , therefore , watched his motions with feelings of intense horror which were in no degree diminished by his coming close up to her , and shouting in her ear in an agitated , and as it seemed to her , a threatening tone-- ‘
47685	47712	47713	47713	Missus	2095	’ Now it so happened that Mr. Jingle was walking in the garden close to the arbour at that moment . He too heard the shouts of ‘
47715	47776	47777	47777	Missus	2096	’ and stopped to hear more . There were three reasons for his doing so . In the first place , he was idle and curious ; secondly , he was by no means scrupulous ; thirdly , and lastly , he was concealed from view by some flowering shrubs . So there he stood , and there he listened . ‘
47779	47785	47777	47777	Missus	2096	’ shouted the fat boy . ‘
47790	47797	47788	47788	Joe	241	’ said the trembling old lady . ‘
47799	47838	47880	47882	the old lady	10352	’m sure I have been a good mistress to you , Joe . You have invariably been treated very kindly . You have never had too much to do ; and you have always had enough to eat . ’
47861	47867	47858	47858	he	1437	‘ I knows I has . ’
47868	47878	47880	47882	the old lady	10352	‘ Then what can you want to do now ? ’
47887	47896	47898	47899	the boy	1304	‘ I wants to make your flesh creep , ’
47941	47955	47957	47958	the boy	1304	‘ What do you think I see in this very arbour last night ? ’
47960	47966	47968	47970	the old lady	10352	‘ Bless us ! What ? ’
47982	47997	47968	47970	the old lady	10352	‘ The strange gentleman -- him as had his arm hurt -- a - kissin ’
48000	48001	48004	48004	Joe	241	‘ ‘
48014	48019	48021	48023	the fat boy	1437	’ Worser than that , ’
48032	48039	48021	48023	the fat boy	1437	‘ Not one of my grandda’aters ? ’
48040	48045	48026	48028	the old lady	10352	‘ Worser than that . ’
48046	48053	48055	48057	the old lady	10352	‘ Worse than that , Joe ! ’
48070	48082	48055	48057	the old lady	10352	‘ Who was it , Joe ? I insist upon knowing . ’
48103	48107	48083	48085	The fat boy	1437	‘ Miss Rachael . ’
48108	48111	48113	48115	the old lady	10352	‘ What ! ’
48122	48126	48113	48115	the old lady	10352	‘ Speak louder . ’
48127	48131	48133	48135	the fat boy	1437	‘ Miss Rachael , ’
48137	48141	48133	48135	the fat boy	1437	‘ My da’ater ! ’
48168	48174	48176	48178	the old lady	10352	‘ And she suffered him ! ’
48192	48199	48190	48190	he	1437	‘ I see her a - kissin ’
48204	48263	48190	48190	he	1437	’ If Mr. Jingle , from his place of concealment , could have beheld the expression which the old lady ’s face assumed at this communication , the probability is that a sudden burst of laughter would have betrayed his close vicinity to the summer - house . He listened attentively . Fragments of angry sentences such as , ‘
48272	48283	48309	48309	he	0	‘ ooman like me’--‘Might have waited till I was dead , ’
48474	48650	48651	48652	Miss Wardle	289	‘ em . Mr. Jingle knew that young men , to spinster aunts , are as lighted gas to gunpowder , and he determined to essay the effect of an explosion without loss of time . Full of reflections upon this important decision , he crept from his place of concealment , and , under cover of the shrubs before mentioned , approached the house . Fortune seemed determined to favour his design . Mr. Tupman and the rest of the gentlemen left the garden by the side gate just as he obtained a view of it ; and the young ladies , he knew , had walked out alone , soon after breakfast . The coast was clear . The breakfast - parlour door was partially open . He peeped in . The spinster aunt was knitting . He coughed ; she looked up and smiled . Hesitation formed no part of Mr. Alfred Jingle ’s character . He laid his finger on his lips mysteriously , walked in , and closed the door . ‘
48654	48663	48651	48652	Miss Wardle	289	’ said Mr. Jingle , with affected earnestness , ‘
48678	48679	48680	48680	Sir	9716	’ ‘
48682	48703	48680	48680	Sir	9716	’ said the spinster aunt , rather astonished by the unexpected apparition and somewhat doubtful of Mr. Jingle ’s sanity . ‘
48706	48725	48680	48680	Sir	9716	’ said Mr. Jingle , in a stage - whisper--‘Large boy -- dumpling face-- round eyes -- rascal ! ’
48741	48751	48753	48754	the lady	10556	‘ I presume you allude to Joseph , Sir ? ’
48763	48807	48753	48754	the lady	10556	‘ Yes , ma’am -- damn that Joe!--treacherous dog , Joe -- told the old lady-- old lady furious -- wild -- raving -- arbour -- Tupman -- kissing and hugging -- all that sort of thing -- eh , ma’am -- eh ? ’
48808	48812	48814	48816	the spinster aunt	1474	‘ Mr. Jingle , ’
48818	48829	48814	48816	the spinster aunt	1474	‘ if you come here , Sir , to insult me-- ’
48830	48839	48841	48843	the unabashed Mr.	2131	‘ Not at all -- by no means , ’
48887	48895	48897	48899	the poor spinster	2132	‘ What _ shall _ I do ! ’
48905	48912	48897	48899	the poor spinster	2132	‘ My brother will be furious . ’
48913	48919	48921	48922	Mr. Jingle	256	‘ Of course he will , ’
48925	48938	48940	48942	the spinster aunt	1474	’ Oh , Mr. Jingle , what _ can _ I say ! ’
48950	48956	48958	48959	Mr. Jingle	256	‘ Say he dreamt it , ’
48989	49017	48986	48986	his	256	‘ Pooh , pooh!--nothing more easy -- blackguard boy -- lovely woman -- fat boy horsewhipped -- you believed -- end of the matter -- all comfortable . ’
49047	49050	49046	49049	a ‘ lovely woman	10728	‘ lovely woman ’
49104	49112	49114	49115	the lady	10556	‘ You seem unhappy , Mr. Jingle , ’
49122	49150	49114	49115	the lady	10556	‘ May I show my gratitude for your kind interference , by inquiring into the cause , with a view , if possible , to its removal ? ’
49151	49154	49156	49157	Mr. Jingle	256	‘ Ha ! ’
49218	49256	49213	49214	Miss Wardle	289	’ At the conclusion of this address , the most consecutive he was ever known to utter , Mr. Jingle applied to his eyes the remnant of a handkerchief before noticed , and turned towards the door . ‘
49262	49269	49259	49260	Mr. Jingle	256	’ said the spinster aunt emphatically . ‘
49282	49283	49276	49277	Mr. Tupman	244	’ ‘
49286	49300	49276	49277	Mr. Tupman	244	’ exclaimed Jingle , with a professional ( i.e. , theatrical ) air . ‘
49303	49335	49336	49337	Mr. Jingle	256	’ and , by way of showing that he had no desire to be questioned further , he drew a chair close to that of the spinster aunt and sat down . ‘
49339	49344	49336	49337	Mr. Jingle	256	’ said the aunt , ‘
49366	49367	49369	49369	I	0	’ ‘
49371	49398	49399	49399	He	256	’ said Mr. Jingle , fixing his eyes on the aunt ’s face--‘can I see -- lovely creature -- sacrificed at the shrine -- heartless avarice ! ’
49420	49427	49399	49399	He	256	‘ Tupman only wants your money . ’
49428	49432	49434	49435	the spinster	2070	‘ The wretch ! ’
49456	49461	49463	49464	Jingle--‘loves another	2146	‘ More than that , ’
49466	49467	49468	49468	Another	2147	’ ‘
49470	49475	49476	49476	Who	2148	’ ejaculated the spinster . ‘
49478	49488	49476	49476	Who	2148	’ Short girl -- black eyes -- niece Emily . ’
49563	49575	49561	49561	she	2145	‘ It ca n’t be . I wo n’t believe it . ’

49581	49585	49579	49579	em	2152	’ said Jingle . ‘

49689	49698	49687	49687	he	2153	’ and she trembled with rage and disappointment . ‘
49704	49708	49709	49709	I	0	’ said Jingle . ‘

49753	49867	49750	49750	You	0	’ Mr. Jingle fell on his knees , remained thereupon for five minutes thereafter ; and rose the accepted lover of the spinster aunt-- conditionally upon Mr. Tupman ’s perjury being made clear and manifest . The burden of proof lay with Mr. Alfred Jingle ; and he produced his evidence that very day at dinner . The spinster aunt could hardly believe her eyes . Mr. Tracy Tupman was established at Emily ’s side , ogling , whispering , and smiling , in opposition to Mr. Snodgrass . Not a word , not a look , not a glance , did he bestow upon his heart ’s pride of the evening before . ‘
49872	49887	49869	49870	that boy	10162	’ thought old Mr. Wardle to himself.--He had heard the story from his mother . ‘
49903	49904	49905	49905	Traitor	2156	’ ‘
49907	49913	49905	49905	Traitor	2156	’ thought the spinster aunt . ‘
49930	50003	49925	49925	I	0	’ The following conversation may serve to explain to our readers this apparently unaccountable alteration of deportment on the part of Mr. Tracy Tupman . The time was evening ; the scene the garden . There were two figures walking in a side path ; one was rather short and stout ; the other tall and slim . They were Mr. Tupman and Mr. Jingle . The stout figure commenced the dialogue . ‘
50010	50014	50006	50006	I	0	’ he inquired . ‘
50039	50040	50042	50042	Rachael	289	’ ‘

50310	50346	50292	50292	My	0	’ replied Mr. Jingle . He stopped short , as if suddenly recollecting something , and said--‘By the bye -- can’t spare ten pounds , can you?--very particular purpose -- pay you in three days . ’
50347	50354	50356	50357	Mr. Tupman	244	‘ I dare say I can , ’
50366	50373	50356	50357	Mr. Tupman	244	‘ Three days , you say ? ’
50374	50387	50388	50389	Mr. Tupman	244	‘ Only three days -- all over then -- no more difficulties . ’
50417	50421	50423	50424	Mr. Jingle--‘not	338	‘ Be careful , ’

50499	50699	50493	50493	I	0	’ said Mr. Jingle internally ; and they entered the house . The scene of that afternoon was repeated that evening , and on the three afternoons and evenings next ensuing . On the fourth , the host was in high spirits , for he had satisfied himself that there was no ground for the charge against Mr. Tupman . So was Mr. Tupman , for Mr. Jingle had told him that his affair would soon be brought to a crisis . So was Mr. Pickwick , for he was seldom otherwise . So was not Mr. Snodgrass , for he had grown jealous of Mr. Tupman . So was the old lady , for she had been winning at whist . So were Mr. Jingle and Miss Wardle , for reasons of sufficient importance in this eventful history to be narrated in another chapter . CHAPTER IX . A DISCOVERY AND A CHASE The supper was ready laid , the chairs were drawn round the table , bottles , jugs , and glasses were arranged upon the sideboard , and everything betokened the approach of the most convivial period in the whole four - and - twenty hours . ‘
50704	50709	50702	50702	Rachael	289	’ said Mr. Wardle . ‘
50715	50720	50713	50713	Jingle	256	’ added Mr. Pickwick . ‘
50724	50729	50713	50713	Jingle	256	’ said the host , ‘
50765	50777	50756	50756	Emily	294	’ The bell was rung , and the fat boy appeared . ‘
50783	50789	50780	50781	Miss Rachael	289	’ He could n’t say . ‘
50797	50841	50792	50793	Mr. Jingle	256	’ He did n’t know . Everybody looked surprised . It was late -- past eleven o’clock . Mr. Tupman laughed in his sleeve . They were loitering somewhere , talking about him . Ha , ha ! capital notion that -- funny . ‘
50845	50854	50855	50855	They	2172	’ said Wardle , after a short pause . ‘

50879	50884	50865	50865	I	0	’ said Mr. Pickwick--‘admirable . ’

51062	51072	51074	51075	the host	10403	‘ What the devil ’s the meaning of this ? ’
51077	51092	51094	51096	the old lady	10352	‘ The kitchen chimney ai n’t a - fire , is it , Emma ? ’
51098	51105	51108	51110	the young ladies	1480	‘ Lor , grandma ! No , ’
51112	51118	51120	51124	the master of the house	2185	‘ What ’s the matter ? ’

51148	51172	51146	51146	Sir	9716	’ ( At this juncture Mr. Tupman was observed to lay down his knife and fork , and to turn very pale . ) ‘
51177	51183	51187	51188	Miss Rachael	289	’ said Mr. Wardle fiercely . ‘

51263	51290	51291	51291	Lord	2191	’ and with sundry incoherent exclamations of the like nature , the unhappy gentleman spun round and round the apartment , in a transport of frenzy . ‘
51295	51311	51291	51291	Lord	2191	’ ejaculated Mr. Pickwick , eyeing the extraordinary gestures of his friend with terrified surprise . ‘
51322	51325	51327	51340	the stout old host , who regarded only the last words of the sentence	2193	’ Do ! ’

51416	51429	51430	51430	He	835	’ cried Wardle , as he rushed at the ill- starred youth . ‘

51489	51508	51477	51477	me	0	’ screamed all the women , above whose exclamations the blubbering of the fat boy was distinctly audible . ‘
51515	51521	51522	51523	Mr. Winkle	276	’ cried the old man . ‘
51539	51640	51522	51523	Mr. Winkle	276	’ It was a beautiful sight , in that moment of turmoil and confusion , to behold the placid and philosophical expression of Mr. Pickwick ’s face , albeit somewhat flushed with exertion , as he stood with his arms firmly clasped round the extensive waist of their corpulent host , thus restraining the impetuosity of his passion , while the fat boy was scratched , and pulled , and pushed from the room by all the females congregated therein . He had no sooner released his hold , than the man entered to announce that the gig was ready . ‘
51648	51653	51654	51654	He	240	’ screamed the females . ‘

51667	51672	51661	51661	I	0	’ said Mr. Pickwick . ‘
51674	51681	51683	51684	the host	10403	’re a good fellow , Pickwick , ’
51690	51726	51683	51684	the host	10403	‘ Emma , give Mr. Pickwick a shawl to tie round his neck -- make haste . Look after your grandmother , girls ; she has fainted away . Now then , are you ready ? ’
51771	51779	51781	51782	the host	10403	‘ Give her her head , Tom , ’
51823	51830	51832	51832	Wardle	292	‘ How much are they ahead ? ’
51859	51869	51871	51871	everybody	987	‘ Not above three - quarters of an hour , ’
51875	51883	51884	51884	em	2209	‘ Chaise - and - four directly!--out with ‘

51898	51915	51896	51896	boys	2210	’ cried the landlord--‘chaise - and - four out -- make haste -- look alive there ! ’
51938	51970	51918	51919	the hostlers	2211	’ hoofs clattered on the uneven paving of the yard ; the chaise rumbled as it was drawn out of the coach - house ; and all was noise and bustle . ‘
51981	51985	51918	51919	the hostlers	2211	’ cried Wardle . ‘
51994	52019	51992	51992	Sir	9716	’ replied the hostler . Out came the chaise -- in went the horses -- on sprang the boys -- in got the travellers . ‘
52034	52038	52041	52041	you	292	’ shouted Wardle . ‘
52043	52068	52041	52041	you	292	’ The boys applied whip and spur , the waiters shouted , the hostlers cheered , and away they went , fast and furiously . ‘
52072	52088	52041	52041	you	292	’ thought Mr. Pickwick , when he had had a moment ’s time for reflection . ‘
52117	52201	52214	52214	he	2216	’ For the first three or four miles , not a word was spoken by either of the gentlemen , each being too much immersed in his own reflections to address any observations to his companion . When they had gone over that much ground , however , and the horses getting thoroughly warmed began to do their work in really good style , Mr. Pickwick became too much exhilarated with the rapidity of the motion , to remain any longer perfectly mute . ‘
52203	52212	52214	52214	he	2216	’re sure to catch them , I think , ’
52216	52220	52214	52214	he	2216	‘ Hope so , ’
52225	52229	52231	52232	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Fine night , ’
52245	52251	52253	52253	Wardle	292	‘ So much the worse , ’
52255	52289	52253	52253	Wardle	292	‘ for they ’ll have had all the advantage of the moonlight to get the start of us , and we shall lose it . It will have gone down in another hour . ’
52290	52308	52310	52311	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ It will be rather unpleasant going at this rate in the dark , wo n’t it ? ’
52313	52320	52322	52323	his friend	791	‘ I dare say it will , ’
52373	52384	52386	52388	the first boy	2223	‘ Yo - yo - yo - yo - yoe ! ’
52390	52399	52401	52402	the second	2224	‘ Yo - yo - yo - yoe ! ’
52404	52413	52418	52418	himself	292	‘ Yo - yo - yo - yoe ! ’
52436	52445	52447	52448	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Yo - yo - yo - yoe ! ’
52486	52492	52494	52495	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ What ’s the matter ? ’
52497	52504	52506	52507	old Wardle	292	‘ There ’s a gate here , ’
52509	52518	52506	52507	old Wardle	292	‘ We shall hear something of the fugitives . ’
52553	52567	52569	52570	Mr. Wardle	292	‘ How long is it since a post - chaise went through here ? ’
52572	52576	52569	52570	Mr. Wardle	292	‘ How long ? ’
52577	52580	52569	52570	Mr. Wardle	292	‘ Ah ! ’
52581	52612	52569	52570	Mr. Wardle	292	‘ Why , I do n’t rightly know . It worn’t a long time ago , nor it worn’t a short time ago -- just between the two , perhaps . ’
52613	52622	52569	52570	Mr. Wardle	292	‘ Has any chaise been by at all ? ’
52623	52635	52569	52570	Mr. Wardle	292	‘ Oh , yes , there ’s been a chay by . ’
52636	52644	52646	52647	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ How long ago , my friend , ’
52649	52653	52646	52647	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ an hour ? ’
52654	52664	52666	52667	the man	835	‘ Ah , I dare say it might be , ’
52669	52674	52676	52682	the post -- boy on the wheeler	2228	‘ Or two hours ? ’
52684	52695	52697	52699	the old man	1779	‘ Well , I should n’t wonder if it was , ’
52702	52708	52710	52713	the testy old gentleman	2230	‘ Drive on , boys , ’
52715	52727	52710	52713	the testy old gentleman	2230	‘ do n’t waste any more time with that old idiot ! ’
52728	52731	52733	52735	the old man	1779	‘ Idiot ! ’
52767	52773	52741	52741	he	1779	‘ No -- not much o ’
52831	53033	52825	52829	old short - and- fat	2236	’ And with another prolonged grin , the old man closed the gate , re- entered his house , and bolted the door after him . Meanwhile the chaise proceeded , without any slackening of pace , towards the conclusion of the stage . The moon , as Wardle had foretold , was rapidly on the wane ; large tiers of dark , heavy clouds , which had been gradually overspreading the sky for some time past , now formed one black mass overhead ; and large drops of rain which pattered every now and then against the windows of the chaise , seemed to warn the travellers of the rapid approach of a stormy night . The wind , too , which was directly against them , swept in furious gusts down the narrow road , and howled dismally through the trees which skirted the pathway . Mr. Pickwick drew his coat closer about him , coiled himself more snugly up into the corner of the chaise , and fell into a sound sleep , from which he was only awakened by the stopping of the vehicle , the sound of the hostler ’s bell , and a loud cry of ‘
53038	53293	52825	52829	old short - and- fat	2236	’ But here another delay occurred . The boys were sleeping with such mysterious soundness , that it took five minutes a - piece to wake them . The hostler had somehow or other mislaid the key of the stable , and even when that was found , two sleepy helpers put the wrong harness on the wrong horses , and the whole process of harnessing had to be gone through afresh . Had Mr. Pickwick been alone , these multiplied obstacles would have completely put an end to the pursuit at once , but old Wardle was not to be so easily daunted ; and he laid about him with such hearty good - will , cuffing this man , and pushing that ; strapping a buckle here , and taking in a link there , that the chaise was ready in a much shorter time than could reasonably have been expected , under so many difficulties . They resumed their journey ; and certainly the prospect before them was by no means encouraging . The stage was fifteen miles long , the night was dark , the wind high , and the rain pouring in torrents . It was impossible to make any great way against such obstacles united ; it was hard upon one o’clock already ; and nearly two hours were consumed in getting to the end of the stage . Here , however , an object presented itself , which rekindled their hopes , and reanimated their drooping spirits . ‘
53301	53329	52825	52829	old short - and- fat	2236	’ cried old Wardle , leaping out of his own vehicle , and pointing to one covered with wet mud , which was standing in the yard . ‘
53340	53352	53353	53353	Lady	2238	’ replied the hostler , to whom the question was addressed . ‘
53357	53366	53369	53369	sir	9716	’ inquired Wardle , almost breathless with impatience . ‘
53371	53372	53373	53374	Tall gentleman	2241	’ ‘
53386	53387	53390	53390	sir	9716	’ ‘

53423	53429	53418	53419	the couple	2245	’ exclaimed the old gentleman . ‘
53436	53441	53443	53443	they	2245	’ said the hostler , ‘
53448	53449	53443	53443	they	2245	’ ‘
53450	53454	53456	53456	Wardle	292	’ Tis them ! ’
53458	53504	53456	53456	Wardle	292	‘ it is , by Jove ! Chaise - and - four instantly ! We shall catch them yet before they reach the next stage . A guinea a - piece , boys - be alive there -- bustle about -- there ’s good fellows . ’
53592	53599	53601	53602	old Wardle	292	‘ Jump in -- jump in ! ’
53621	53628	53601	53602	old Wardle	292	‘ Come along ! Make haste ! ’
53670	53678	53680	53682	the old gentleman	10238	‘ Ah ! we are moving now , ’
53719	53723	53725	53729	the stout old Mr. Wardle	292	‘ Hold up ! ’
53742	53754	53756	53757	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I never did feel such a jolting in my life , ’
53759	53763	53756	53757	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Never mind , ’
53768	53779	53756	53757	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ it will soon be over . Steady , steady . ’
53847	53852	53856	53856	his	240	‘ Here they are ! ’
53885	53892	53895	53897	the old gentleman	10238	‘ Go on , go on , ’
53899	53910	53911	53911	em	2257	‘ Two guineas a - piece , boys -- don’t let ‘
53924	53949	53950	53950	I	0	’ The horses in the first chaise started on at their utmost speed ; and those in Mr. Wardle ’s galloped furiously behind them . ‘
53955	53962	53950	53950	I	0	’ exclaimed the choleric old man ; ‘
53970	53971	53965	53965	I	0	’ ‘
53975	53980	53983	53983	he	292	’ said Mr. Pickwick ; ‘
53985	54387	53983	53983	he	292	’ Mr. Pickwick was not mistaken . The countenance of Mr. Jingle , completely coated with mud thrown up by the wheels , was plainly discernible at the window of his chaise ; and the motion of his arm , which was waving violently towards the postillions , denoted that he was encouraging them to increased exertion . The interest was intense . Fields , trees , and hedges , seemed to rush past them with the velocity of a whirlwind , so rapid was the pace at which they tore along . They were close by the side of the first chaise . Jingle ’s voice could be plainly heard , even above the din of the wheels , urging on the boys . Old Mr. Wardle foamed with rage and excitement . He roared out scoundrels and villains by the dozen , clenched his fist and shook it expressively at the object of his indignation ; but Mr. Jingle only answered with a contemptuous smile , and replied to his menaces by a shout of triumph , as his horses , answering the increased application of whip and spur , broke into a faster gallop , and left the pursuers behind . Mr. Pickwick had just drawn in his head , and Mr. Wardle , exhausted with shouting , had done the same , when a tremendous jolt threw them forward against the front of the vehicle . There was a sudden bump -- a loud crash- -away rolled a wheel , and over went the chaise . After a very few seconds of bewilderment and confusion , in which nothing but the plunging of horses , and breaking of glass could be made out , Mr. Pickwick felt himself violently pulled out from among the ruins of the chaise ; and as soon as he had gained his feet , extricated his head from the skirts of his greatcoat , which materially impeded the usefulness of his spectacles , the full disaster of the case met his view . Old Mr. Wardle without a hat , and his clothes torn in several places , stood by his side , and the fragments of the chaise lay scattered at their feet . The post - boys , who had succeeded in cutting the traces , were standing , disfigured with mud and disordered by hard riding , by the horses ’
54469	54472	54474	54476	the shameless Jingle	2260	‘ Hollo ! ’
54478	54492	54474	54476	the shameless Jingle	2260	‘ anybody damaged?--elderly gentlemen -- no light weights -- dangerous work -- very . ’
54493	54495	54496	54497	a rascal	2261	‘ You ’re
54499	54503	54496	54497	a rascal	2261	’ roared Wardle . ‘
54508	54564	54565	54566	The postillions	2258	’ replied Jingle ; and then he added , with a knowing wink , and a jerk of the thumb towards the interior of the chaise--‘I say -- she ’s very well -- desires her compliments -- begs you wo n’t trouble yourself -- love to _ Tuppy_--won’t you get up behind?--drive on , boys . ’
54636	54639	54666	54666	he	240	‘ Tuppy , ’
54672	54682	54666	54666	he	240	‘ If ever I meet that man again , I’ll-- ’
54683	54688	54690	54690	Wardle	292	‘ Yes , yes , ’
54692	54718	54690	54690	Wardle	292	‘ that ’s all very well ; but while we stand talking here , they ’ll get their licence , and be married in London . ’
54733	54743	54745	54746	Mr. Wardle	292	‘ How far is it to the next stage ? ’
54754	54764	54745	54746	Mr. Wardle	292	‘ Six mile , ai n’t it , Tom ? ’
54765	54769	54745	54746	Mr. Wardle	292	‘ Rayther better . ’
54770	54779	54745	54746	Mr. Wardle	292	‘ Rayther better nor six mile , Sir . ’
54780	54786	54788	54788	Wardle	292	‘ Ca n’t be helped , ’
54790	54798	54788	54788	Wardle	292	‘ we must walk it , Pickwick . ’
54799	54805	54807	54810	that truly great man	2267	‘ No help for it , ’
54912	55630	55631	55631	Sam	240	’S CHARACTER There are in London several old inns , once the headquarters of celebrated coaches in the days when coaches performed their journeys in a graver and more solemn manner than they do in these times ; but which have now degenerated into little more than the abiding and booking- places of country wagons . The reader would look in vain for any of these ancient hostelries , among the Golden Crosses and Bull and Mouths , which rear their stately fronts in the improved streets of London . If he would light upon any of these old places , he must direct his steps to the obscurer quarters of the town , and there in some secluded nooks he will find several , still standing with a kind of gloomy sturdiness , amidst the modern innovations which surround them . In the Borough especially , there still remain some half - dozen old inns , which have preserved their external features unchanged , and which have escaped alike the rage for public improvement and the encroachments of private speculation . Great , rambling queer old places they are , with galleries , and passages , and staircases , wide enough and antiquated enough to furnish materials for a hundred ghost stories , supposing we should ever be reduced to the lamentable necessity of inventing any , and that the world should exist long enough to exhaust the innumerable veracious legends connected with old London Bridge , and its adjacent neighbourhood on the Surrey side . It was in the yard of one of these inns -- of no less celebrated a one than the White Hart -- that a man was busily employed in brushing the dirt off a pair of boots , early on the morning succeeding the events narrated in the last chapter . He was habited in a coarse , striped waistcoat , with black calico sleeves , and blue glass buttons ; drab breeches and leggings . A bright red handkerchief was wound in a very loose and unstudied style round his neck , and an old white hat was carelessly thrown on one side of his head . There were two rows of boots before him , one cleaned and the other dirty , and at every addition he made to the clean row , he paused from his work , and contemplated its results with evident satisfaction . The yard presented none of that bustle and activity which are the usual characteristics of a large coach inn . Three or four lumbering wagons , each with a pile of goods beneath its ample canopy , about the height of the second - floor window of an ordinary house , were stowed away beneath a lofty roof which extended over one end of the yard ; and another , which was probably to commence its journey that morning , was drawn out into the open space . A double tier of bedroom galleries , with old clumsy balustrades , ran round two sides of the straggling area , and a double row of bells to correspond , sheltered from the weather by a little sloping roof , hung over the door leading to the bar and coffee - room . Two or three gigs and chaise - carts were wheeled up under different little sheds and pent - houses ; and the occasional heavy tread of a cart - horse , or rattling of a chain at the farther end of the yard , announced to anybody who cared about the matter , that the stable lay in that direction . When we add that a few boys in smock - frocks were lying asleep on heavy packages , wool - packs , and other articles that were scattered about on heaps of straw , we have described as fully as need be the general appearance of the yard of the White Hart Inn , High Street , Borough , on the particular morning in question . A loud ringing of one of the bells was followed by the appearance of a smart chambermaid in the upper sleeping gallery , who , after tapping at one of the doors , and receiving a request from within , called over the balustrades-- ‘
55633	55634	55635	55635	Hollo	303	’ ‘
55637	55646	55635	55635	Hollo	303	’ replied the man with the white hat . ‘
55655	55656	55635	55635	Hollo	303	’ ‘
55667	55676	55635	55635	Hollo	303	‘ em now , or vait till he gets ‘
55679	55684	55635	55635	Hollo	303	’ was the reply . ‘
55695	55701	55702	55703	the gentleman	883	’ said the girl coaxingly , ‘
55709	55710	55702	55703	the gentleman	883	’ ‘
55720	55730	55732	55735	the boot - cleaner	2274	‘ ooman for a musical party , you are , ’
55737	55747	55732	55735	the boot - cleaner	2274	‘ Look at these here boots -- eleven pair o ’
55824	55836	55811	55811	he	348	’ , Sir , but I ’ll attend to you directly . ’
55881	55884	55886	55887	the landlady	2280	‘ Sam , ’
55889	55913	55886	55887	the landlady	2280	‘ where ’s that lazy , idle -- why , Sam -- oh , there you are ; why do n’t you answer ? ’
55914	55929	55931	55931	Sam	240	‘ Vouldn’t be gen - teel to answer , till you ’d done talking , ’
55934	55947	55931	55931	Sam	240	‘ Here , clean these shoes for number seventeen directly , and take ‘
55961	55979	55931	55931	Sam	240	’ The landlady flung a pair of lady ’s shoes into the yard , and bustled away . ‘
55983	56029	55931	55931	Sam	240	’ said Sam , as he picked up the shoes , and taking a piece of chalk from his pocket , made a memorandum of their destination on the soles--‘Lady ’s shoes and private sittin’-room ! I suppose she did n’t come in the vagin . ’
56030	56038	56040	56041	the girl	9813	‘ She came in early this morning , ’
56054	56078	56040	56041	the girl	9813	‘ with a gentleman in a hackney - coach , and it ’s him as wants his boots , and you ’d better do ‘
56087	56088	56040	56041	the girl	9813	’ ‘
56097	56117	56092	56092	you	9813	’ said Sam , with great indignation , singling out the boots in question from the heap before him . ‘
56126	56152	56092	56092	you	9813	’ the regular threepennies . Private room ! and a lady too ! If he ’s anything of a gen’l’m’n , he ’s vurth a shillin ’
56161	56229	56092	56092	you	9813	’ Stimulated by this inspiring reflection , Mr. Samuel brushed away with such hearty good - will , that in a few minutes the boots and shoes , with a polish which would have struck envy to the soul of the amiable Mr. Warren ( for they used Day & amp ; Martin at the White Hart ) , had arrived at the door of number five . ‘
56233	56301	56302	56302	Boots	278	’ said a man ’s voice , in reply to Sam ’s rap at the door . Sam made his best bow , and stepped into the presence of a lady and gentleman seated at breakfast . Having officiously deposited the gentleman ’s boots right and left at his feet , and the lady ’s shoes right and left at hers , he backed towards the door . ‘
56304	56309	56310	56310	Sir	9716	’ said the gentleman . ‘
56312	56331	56310	56310	Sir	9716	’ said Sam , closing the door , and keeping his hand on the knob of the lock . ‘
56343	56346	56310	56310	Sir	9716	’ Commons ? ’
56347	56352	56310	56310	Sir	9716	‘ Yes , Sir . ’
56353	56358	56310	56310	Sir	9716	‘ Where is it ? ’
56359	56395	56403	56404	the gentleman	883	‘ Paul ’s Churchyard , Sir ; low archway on the carriage side , bookseller ’s at one corner , hotel on the other , and two porters in the middle as touts for licences . ’
56396	56401	56403	56404	the gentleman	883	‘ Touts for licences ! ’
56406	56411	56413	56413	Sam	240	‘ Touts for licences , ’
56415	56456	56413	56413	Sam	240	‘ Two coves in vhite aprons -- touches their hats ven you walk in--“Licence , Sir , licence ? ” Queer sort , them , and their mas’rs , too , sir -- Old Bailey Proctors -- and no mistake . ’
56457	56463	56465	56466	the gentleman	883	‘ What do they do ? ’

My father , Sir , wos a coachman . A widower he wos , and fat enough for anything -- uncommon fat , to be sure . His missus dies , and leaves him four hundred pound . Down he goes to the Commons , to see the lawyer and draw the blunt -- very smart-- top boots on -- nosegay in his button - hole -- broad - brimmed tile -- green shawl -- quite the gen’l’m’n . Goes through the archvay , thinking how he should inwest the money -- up comes the touter , touches his hat--“Licence , Sir , licence?”--“What ’s that ? ” says my father.--“Licence , Sir , ” says he.--“What licence ? ” says my father.--“Marriage licence , ” says the touter.--“Dash my veskit , ” says my father , “ I never thought o ’

My father was struck all of a heap . “ Blessed if I know , ” says he.--“Not know ! ” says the lawyer.--“No more nor you do , ” says my father ; “ ca n’t I put that in arterwards?”--“Impossible ! ” says the lawyer.--“Wery well , ” says my father , after he ’d thought a moment , “ put down Mrs. Clarke . ”--“What Clarke ? ” says the lawyer , dipping his pen in the ink.--“Susan Clarke , Markis o ’

57163	57177	57210	57211	Mr. Jingle	256	’ said the gentleman , whom we need hardly introduce as Mr. Jingle . ‘
57183	57190	57193	57195	dearest of angels	2303	’ said the spinster aunt coquettishly . ‘

57271	57290	57269	57269	Rachael	289	‘ Run on -- nothing to the hours , days , weeks , months , years , when we ’re

57436	57442	57444	57445	the spinster	2070	‘ Do n’t be long , ’
57461	57468	57449	57450	Mr. Jingle	256	‘ Long away from you?--Cruel charmer , ’
57495	57499	57501	57502	the spinster	2070	‘ Dear man ! ’

57563	57624	57559	57559	his	256	’ Commons . It will be sufficient for our purpose to relate , that escaping the snares of the dragons in white aprons , who guard the entrance to that enchanted region , he reached the vicar - general ’s office in safety and having procured a highly flattering address on parchment , from the Archbishop of Canterbury , to his ‘
57638	57765	57766	57767	My friend	9719	’ he carefully deposited the mystic document in his pocket , and retraced his steps in triumph to the Borough . He was yet on his way to the White Hart , when two plump gentleman and one thin one entered the yard , and looked round in search of some authorised person of whom they could make a few inquiries . Mr. Samuel Weller happened to be at that moment engaged in burnishing a pair of painted tops , the personal property of a farmer who was refreshing himself with a slight lunch of two or three pounds of cold beef and a pot or two of porter , after the fatigues of the Borough market ; and to him the thin gentleman straightway advanced . ‘
57769	57775	57766	57767	My friend	9719	’ said the thin gentleman . ‘
57777	57780	57766	57767	My friend	9719	’re one o ’
57786	57790	57766	57767	My friend	9719	’ thought Sam , ‘
57800	57806	57808	57808	he	9719	’ me all at once . ’
57814	57815	57812	57812	Sir	9716	’ ‘
57819	57842	57812	57812	Sir	9716	’ said the thin gentleman , with a conciliatory hem--‘have you got many people stopping here now ? Pretty busy . Eh ? ’
57997	58003	58005	58007	the little man	2005	‘ Pretty busy , eh ? ’
58009	58017	58019	58019	Sam	356	‘ Oh , wery well , Sir , ’
58021	58058	58019	58019	Sam	356	‘ we sha n’t be bankrupts , and we sha n’t make our fort’ns . We eats our biled mutton without capers , and do n’t care for horse - radish ven ve can get beef . ’
58059	58062	58064	58066	the little man	2005	‘ Ah , ’

58117	58127	58115	58115	yours	2005	’ said the little man , looking round him . ‘
58142	58147	58151	58151	Sam	356	’ had it repaired ; ’
58236	58244	58246	58248	the benevolent gentleman	2333	‘ The fact of the matter is , ’
58250	58277	58246	58248	the benevolent gentleman	2333	‘ that my friend here ( pointing to the other plump gentleman ) will give you half a guinea , if you ’ll answer one or two-- ’

58295	58355	58291	58293	the little man	2005	‘ pray , allow me-- my dear Sir , the very first principle to be observed in these cases , is this : if you place the matter in the hands of a professional man , you must in no way interfere in the progress of the business ; you must repose implicit confidence in him . Really , Mr.-- ’
58367	58375	58356	58356	He	2005	‘ I forget your friend ’s name . ’
58376	58379	58381	58382	Mr. Wardle	292	‘ Pickwick , ’

Really , my dear Sir , really ; ’
58481	58488	58490	58491	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ My only wish , Sir , ’
58493	58509	58490	58491	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ was to bring this very unpleasant matter to as speedy a close as possible . ’
58510	58517	58519	58521	the little man	2005	‘ Quite right -- quite right , ’
58523	58528	58530	58531	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ With which view , ’
58533	58558	58530	58531	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I made use of the argument which my experience of men has taught me is the most likely to succeed in any case . ’
58559	58564	58566	58568	the little man	2005	‘ Ay , ay , ’
58570	58593	58530	58531	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ very good , very good , indeed ; but you should have suggested it to me . My dear sir , I ’m

58649	58664	58646	58647	George Barnwell	357	’ interrupted Sam , who had remained a wondering listener during this short colloquy ; ‘
58676	58690	58711	58711	You	240	’ it ’s always been my opinion , mind you , that the young ‘
58725	58742	58724	58724	I	0	’m agreeable : I ca n’t say no fairer than that , can I , sir ? ’
58775	58776	58765	58766	the man	835	’ ‘
58781	58786	58789	58791	my dear sir	1228	’ said Mr. Wardle . ‘
58797	58814	58789	58791	my dear sir	1228	’ interposed the busy little man . Mr. Wardle shrugged his shoulders , and was silent . ‘
58820	58827	58815	58815	We	2343	’ said the little man solemnly ; ‘
58859	58860	58845	58845	we	2343	’ ‘
58868	58895	58845	58845	we	2343	’ said Sam , in whose mind the inmates were always represented by that particular article of their costume , which came under his immediate superintendence . ‘
58947	58948	59035	59035	Sam	240	’ ‘
58952	58958	59035	59035	Sam	240	’ said the little man . ‘
58963	58971	59035	59035	Sam	240	’ replied Sam , suddenly recollecting himself . ‘
58989	58998	59035	59035	Sam	240	’ lady ’s shoes , in number five . ’
58999	59005	59008	59008	Wardle	292	‘ What sort of shoes ? ’
59029	59033	59035	59035	Sam	240	‘ Country make , ’
59037	59043	59035	59035	Sam	240	‘ Any maker ’s name ? ’
59044	59047	59059	59059	them	2354	‘ Brown . ’
59048	59052	59035	59035	Sam	240	‘ Where of ? ’
59053	59056	59035	59035	Sam	240	‘ Muggleton . ‘
59061	59065	59059	59059	them	2354	’ exclaimed Wardle . ‘
59074	59075	59035	59035	Sam	240	’ ‘
59078	59082	59083	59084	The Vellingtons	360	’ said Sam . ‘

59110	59112	59098	59100	the little man	2005	‘ We ’re
59116	59120	59098	59100	the little man	2005	’ exclaimed Wardle . ‘
59134	59135	59098	59100	the little man	2005	’ ‘
59144	59150	59098	59100	the little man	2005	’ said the little man ; ‘
59155	59183	59098	59100	the little man	2005	’ He drew from his pocket a red silk purse , and looked very hard at Sam as he drew out a sovereign . Sam grinned expressively . ‘
59196	59202	59206	59206	yours	2360	’ said the little man , ‘
59208	59249	59098	59100	the little man	2005	’ Sam threw the painted tops into a corner , and led the way through a dark passage , and up a wide staircase . He paused at the end of a second passage , and held out his hand . ‘
59254	59296	59098	59100	the little man	2005	’ whispered the attorney , as he deposited the money on the hand of their guide . The man stepped forward for a few paces , followed by the two friends and their legal adviser . He stopped at a door . ‘
59302	59393	59394	59394	You	2362	’ murmured the little gentleman . Sam nodded assent . Old Wardle opened the door ; and the whole three walked into the room just as Mr. Jingle , who had that moment returned , had produced the licence to the spinster aunt . The spinster uttered a loud shriek , and throwing herself into a chair , covered her face with her hands . Mr. Jingle crumpled up the licence , and thrust it into his coat pocket . The unwelcome visitors advanced into the middle of the room . ‘
59405	59413	59414	59415	My dear	10214	’ exclaimed Wardle , breathless with passion . ‘
59422	59435	59416	59416	Sir	9716	’ said the little man , laying his hat on the table , ‘
59458	59459	59462	59462	you	2362	’ ‘

59504	59511	59513	59514	Mr. Jingle	256	‘ Who the devil are you ? ’
59534	59542	59544	59544	Wardle	292	‘ Who is he , you scoundrel , ’
59546	59581	59583	59584	Mr. Wardle	292	‘ He ’s my lawyer , Mr. Perker , of Gray ’s Inn . Perker , I ’ll have this fellow prosecuted-- indicted -- I’ll -- I’ll -- I’ll ruin him . And you , ’

It ’s a distressing case -- very ; I never knew one more so ; but really , my dear sir , really we have no power to control this lady ’s actions . I warned you before we came , my dear sir , that there was nothing to look to but a compromise . ’
60284	60293	60295	60296	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ What kind of compromise would you recommend ? ’
60298	60327	60295	60296	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Why , my dear Sir , our friend ’s in an unpleasant position -- very much so . We must be content to suffer some pecuniary loss . ’
60328	60356	60358	60358	Wardle	292	‘ I ’ll suffer any , rather than submit to this disgrace , and let her , fool as she is , be made miserable for life , ’

The old lady is not seventy - three now , my dear Sir . ’

61140	61161	61131	61133	the little man	2005	‘ never mind the last two items . That ’s a hundred and twelve -- say a hundred -- come . ’
61162	61166	61168	61169	Mr. Jingle	256	‘ And twenty , ’
61171	61183	61185	61187	the little man	2005	‘ Come , come , I ’ll write you a cheque , ’
61200	61213	61215	61217	the little man	2005	‘ I ’ll make it payable the day after to - morrow , ’
61226	61237	61215	61217	the little man	2005	‘ and we can get the lady away , meanwhile . ’

61436	61442	61432	61434	the unabashed Jingle	256	‘ Bye bye , Pickwick . ’
61540	61543	61545	61547	the hardened traitor	2422	‘ Here , ’

61720	61939	61650	61652	that eccentric functionary	2426	’ Mr. Pickwick ’s mind , like those of all truly great men , was open to conviction . He was a quick and powerful reasoner ; and a moment ’s reflection sufficed to remind him of the impotency of his rage . It subsided as quickly as it had been roused . He panted for breath , and looked benignantly round upon his friends . Shall we tell the lamentations that ensued when Miss Wardle found herself deserted by the faithless Jingle ? Shall we extract Mr. Pickwick ’s masterly description of that heartrending scene ? His note- book , blotted with the tears of sympathising humanity , lies open before us ; one word , and it is in the printer ’s hands . But , no ! we will be resolute ! We will not wring the public bosom , with the delineation of such suffering ! Slowly and sadly did the two friends and the deserted lady return next day in the Muggleton heavy coach . Dimly and darkly had the sombre shadows of a summer ’s night fallen upon all around , when they again reached Dingley Dell , and stood within the entrance to Manor Farm . CHAPTER XI . INVOLVING ANOTHER JOURNEY , AND AN ANTIQUARIAN DISCOVERY ; RECORDING MR . PICKWICK ’S
61956	62133	61650	61652	that eccentric functionary	2426	’S A night of quiet and repose in the profound silence of Dingley Dell , and an hour ’s breathing of its fresh and fragrant air on the ensuing morning , completely recovered Mr. Pickwick from the effects of his late fatigue of body and anxiety of mind . That illustrious man had been separated from his friends and followers for two whole days ; and it was with a degree of pleasure and delight , which no common imagination can adequately conceive , that he stepped forward to greet Mr. Winkle and Mr. Snodgrass , as he encountered those gentlemen on his return from his early walk . The pleasure was mutual ; for who could ever gaze on Mr. Pickwick ’s beaming face without experiencing the sensation ? But still a cloud seemed to hang over his companions which that great man could not but be sensible of , and was wholly at a loss to account for . There was a mysterious air about them both , as unusual as it was alarming . ‘
62137	62161	62162	62163	Mr. Winkle	276	’ said Mr. Pickwick , when he had grasped his followers by the hand , and exchanged warm salutations of welcome--‘how is Tupman ? ’
62191	62194	62196	62197	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Snodgrass , ’
62200	62211	62196	62197	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ how is our friend -- he is not ill ? ’
62212	62215	62217	62218	Mr. Snodgrass	242	‘ No , ’
62245	62260	62261	62261	Winkle	276	’ Mr. Pickwick stopped , and gazed on each of his friends in turn . ‘
62265	62270	62261	62261	Winkle	276	’ said Mr. Pickwick ; ‘
62301	62321	62295	62295	I	0	’ There was a solemnity -- a dignity -- in Mr. Pickwick ’s manner , not to be withstood . ‘
62326	62331	62322	62322	He	242	’ said Mr. Snodgrass . ‘
62334	62339	62322	62322	He	242	’ exclaimed Mr. Pickwick . ‘
62342	62343	62322	62322	He	242	’ ‘
62346	62351	62322	62322	He	242	’ repeated Mr. Snodgrass . ‘
62354	62359	62322	62322	He	242	’ ejaculated Mr. Pickwick . ‘
62369	62390	62360	62360	We	2431	’ replied Mr. Snodgrass , taking a letter from his pocket , and placing it in his friend ’s hand . ‘
62491	62513	62514	62514	MY	0	’ Mr. Pickwick opened the epistle . It was in his friend ’s hand - writing , and these were its contents:-- ‘
62594	62714	62715	62716	TRACY TUPMAN	244	‘ Any letter addressed to me at the Leather Bottle , Cobham , Kent , will be forwarded -- supposing I still exist . I hasten from the sight of that world , which has become odious to me . Should I hasten from it altogether , pity -- forgive me . Life , my dear Pickwick , has become insupportable to me . The spirit which burns within us , is a porter ’s knot , on which to rest the heavy load of worldly cares and troubles ; and when that spirit fails us , the burden is too heavy to be borne . We sink beneath it . You may tell Rachael -- Ah , that name!-- ‘
62718	62719	62715	62716	TRACY TUPMAN	244	’ ‘
62727	62738	62715	62716	TRACY TUPMAN	244	’ said Mr. Pickwick , as he refolded the note . ‘
62773	62821	62822	62822	You	2447	’ And so saying , he led the way to the house . His intention was rapidly communicated . The entreaties to remain were pressing , but Mr. Pickwick was inflexible . Business , he said , required his immediate attendance . The old clergyman was present . ‘
62828	62844	62822	62822	You	2447	’ said he , taking Mr. Pickwick aside . Mr. Pickwick reiterated his former determination . ‘
62848	62854	62822	62822	You	2447	’ said the old gentleman , ‘
62976	63466	62974	62974	yourself	2447	’ Mr. Pickwick received the manuscript , and parted from the benevolent old gentleman with many expressions of good - will and esteem . It was a more difficult task to take leave of the inmates of Manor Farm , from whom they had received so much hospitality and kindness . Mr. Pickwick kissed the young ladies -- we were going to say , as if they were his own daughters , only , as he might possibly have infused a little more warmth into the salutation , the comparison would not be quite appropriate -- hugged the old lady with filial cordiality ; and patted the rosy cheeks of the female servants in a most patriarchal manner , as he slipped into the hands of each some more substantial expression of his approval . The exchange of cordialities with their fine old host and Mr. Trundle was even more hearty and prolonged ; and it was not until Mr. Snodgrass had been several times called for , and at last emerged from a dark passage followed soon after by Emily ( whose bright eyes looked unusually dim ) , that the three friends were enabled to tear themselves from their friendly entertainers . Many a backward look they gave at the farm , as they walked slowly away ; and many a kiss did Mr. Snodgrass waft in the air , in acknowledgment of something very like a lady ’s handkerchief , which was waved from one of the upper windows , until a turn of the lane hid the old house from their sight . At Muggleton they procured a conveyance to Rochester . By the time they reached the last - named place , the violence of their grief had sufficiently abated to admit of their making a very excellent early dinner ; and having procured the necessary information relative to the road , the three friends set forward again in the afternoon to walk to Cobham . A delightful walk it was ; for it was a pleasant afternoon in June , and their way lay through a deep and shady wood , cooled by the light wind which gently rustled the thick foliage , and enlivened by the songs of the birds that perched upon the boughs . The ivy and the moss crept in thick clusters over the old trees , and the soft green turf overspread the ground like a silken mat . They emerged upon an open park , with an ancient hall , displaying the quaint and picturesque architecture of Elizabeth ’s time . Long vistas of stately oaks and elm trees appeared on every side ; large herds of deer were cropping the fresh grass ; and occasionally a startled hare scoured along the ground , with the speed of the shadows thrown by the light clouds which swept across a sunny landscape like a passing breath of summer . ‘
63470	63508	62974	62974	yourself	2447	’ said Mr. Pickwick , looking about him--‘if this were the place to which all who are troubled with our friend ’s complaint came , I fancy their old attachment to this world would very soon return . ’
63509	63515	63517	63518	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ I think so too , ’
63520	63524	63526	63527	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ And really , ’
63542	63568	63526	63527	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ really , for a misanthrope ’s choice , this is one of the prettiest and most desirable places of residence I ever met with . ’
63620	63630	63632	63633	the landlady	2280	‘ Show the gentlemen into the parlour , Tom , ’
63782	63792	63793	63793	he	9760	‘ I did not expect to see you here , ’
63804	63810	63797	63797	he	9760	‘ It ’s very kind . ’
63811	63814	63816	63817	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Ah ! ’
63835	63854	63855	63856	Mr. Tupman	244	‘ Finish your dinner , and walk out with me . I wish to speak to you alone . ’
63991	63998	63999	63999	he	244	‘ It mattered little to him , ’
64002	64035	63999	63999	he	244	‘ where he dragged out the miserable remainder of his days ; and since his friend laid so much stress upon his humble companionship , he was willing to share his adventures . ’
64150	64156	64158	64159	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ This is very strange , ’
64161	64166	64168	64169	Mr. Tupman	244	‘ What is strange ? ’
64184	64194	64168	64169	Mr. Tupman	244	‘ God bless me , what ’s the matter ? ’
64238	64245	64247	64248	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ There is an inscription here , ’
64250	64255	64257	64258	Mr. Tupman	244	‘ Is it possible ? ’
64260	64265	64267	64268	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I can discern , ’
64300	64308	64267	64268	Mr. Pickwick	240	’ continued Mr. Pickwick , starting up . ‘
64335	64349	64351	64351	you	240	’ He tapped at the cottage door . A labouring man opened it . ‘
64362	64369	64351	64351	you	240	’ inquired the benevolent Mr. Pickwick . ‘
64377	64383	64375	64375	Sir	9716	’ replied the man civilly . ‘
64398	64407	64408	64408	You	240	’ Mr. Pickwick glanced triumphantly at his companion . ‘
64423	64432	64419	64419	I	0	’ said Mr. Pickwick , trembling with anxiety . ‘
64442	64443	64433	64433	You	240	’ ‘
64452	64471	64472	64472	I	0	’ inquired the man , with an expression of face which he probably meant to be very cunning . ‘
64484	64489	64472	64472	I	0	’ said Mr. Pickwick , ‘
64499	64738	64491	64491	you	240	’ The astonishment of the village may be easily imagined , when ( the little stone having been raised with one wrench of a spade ) Mr. Pickwick , by dint of great personal exertion , bore it with his own hands to the inn , and after having carefully washed it , deposited it on the table . The exultation and joy of the Pickwickians knew no bounds , when their patience and assiduity , their washing and scraping , were crowned with success . The stone was uneven and broken , and the letters were straggling and irregular , but the following fragment of an inscription was clearly to be deciphered:-- [ cross ] B I L S T U M P S H I S. M. ARK Mr. Pickwick ’s eyes sparkled with delight , as he sat and gloated over the treasure he had discovered . He had attained one of the greatest objects of his ambition . In a county known to abound in the remains of the early ages ; in a village in which there still existed some memorials of the olden time , he -- he , the chairman of the Pickwick Club -- had discovered a strange and curious inscription of unquestionable antiquity , which had wholly escaped the observation of the many learned men who had preceded him . He could hardly trust the evidence of his senses . ‘
64743	64747	64749	64749	me	0	’ said he , ‘
64759	64760	64751	64751	We	2487	’ ‘
64765	64771	64751	64751	We	2487	’ exclaimed his admiring followers . ‘
64776	64781	64751	64751	We	2487	’ said Mr. Pickwick . ‘
64861	64862	64863	64863	We	2487	’ ‘
64866	64907	64863	64863	We	2487	’ was the animated cry of three voices . Mr. Pickwick looked round him . The attachment and fervour of his followers lighted up a glow of enthusiasm within him . He was their leader , and he felt it . ‘
64919	65469	64863	64863	We	2487	’ said he . This proposition , like the other , was received with unanimous applause . Having himself deposited the important stone in a small deal box , purchased from the landlady for the purpose , he placed himself in an arm - chair , at the head of the table ; and the evening was devoted to festivity and conversation . It was past eleven o’clock -- a late hour for the little village of Cobham -- when Mr. Pickwick retired to the bedroom which had been prepared for his reception . He threw open the lattice window , and setting his light upon the table , fell into a train of meditation on the hurried events of the two preceding days . The hour and the place were both favourable to contemplation ; Mr. Pickwick was roused by the church clock striking twelve . The first stroke of the hour sounded solemnly in his ear , but when the bell ceased the stillness seemed insupportable -- he almost felt as if he had lost a companion . He was nervous and excited ; and hastily undressing himself and placing his light in the chimney , got into bed . Every one has experienced that disagreeable state of mind , in which a sensation of bodily weariness in vain contends against an inability to sleep . It was Mr. Pickwick ’s condition at this moment : he tossed first on one side and then on the other ; and perseveringly closed his eyes as if to coax himself to slumber . It was of no use . Whether it was the unwonted exertion he had undergone , or the heat , or the brandy - and- water , or the strange bed -- whatever it was , his thoughts kept reverting very uncomfortably to the grim pictures downstairs , and the old stories to which they had given rise in the course of the evening . After half an hour ’s tumbling about , he came to the unsatisfactory conclusion , that it was of no use trying to sleep ; so he got up and partially dressed himself . Anything , he thought , was better than lying there fancying all kinds of horrors . He looked out of the window -- it was very dark . He walked about the room -- it was very lonely . He had taken a few turns from the door to the window , and from the window to the door , when the clergyman ’s manuscript for the first time entered his head . It was a good thought . If it failed to interest him , it might send him to sleep . He took it from his coat pocket , and drawing a small table towards his bedside , trimmed the light , put on his spectacles , and composed himself to read . It was a strange handwriting , and the paper was much soiled and blotted . The title gave him a sudden start , too ; and he could not avoid casting a wistful glance round the room . Reflecting on the absurdity of giving way to such feelings , however , he trimmed the light again , and read as follows:-- A MADMAN ’S
65471	65659	65660	65660	I	0	‘ Yes!--a madman ’s ! How that word would have struck to my heart , many years ago ! How it would have roused the terror that used to come upon me sometimes , sending the blood hissing and tingling through my veins , till the cold dew of fear stood in large drops upon my skin , and my knees knocked together with fright ! I like it now though . It ’s a fine name . Show me the monarch whose angry frown was ever feared like the glare of a madman ’s eye -- whose cord and axe were ever half so sure as a madman ’s gripe . Ho ! ho ! It ’s a grand thing to be mad ! to be peeped at like a wild lion through the iron bars -- to gnash one ’s teeth and howl , through the long still night , to the merry ring of a heavy chain and to roll and twine among the straw , transported with such brave music . Hurrah for the madhouse ! Oh , it ’s a rare place ! ‘
65851	66068	65842	65842	I	0	‘ I did this for years ; long , long years they were . The nights here are long sometimes -- very long ; but they are nothing to the restless nights , and dreadful dreams I had at that time . It makes me cold to remember them . Large dusky forms with sly and jeering faces crouched in the corners of the room , and bent over my bed at night , tempting me to madness . They told me in low whispers , that the floor of the old house in which my father died , was stained with his own blood , shed by his own hand in raging madness . I drove my fingers into my ears , but they screamed into my head till the room rang with it , that in one generation before him the madness slumbered , but that his grandfather had lived for years with his hands fettered to the ground , to prevent his tearing himself to pieces . I knew they told the truth -- I knew it well . I had found it out years before , though they had tried to keep it from me . Ha ! ha ! I was too cunning for them , madman as they thought me . ‘
66287	66385	66386	66386	I	0	‘ Riches became mine , wealth poured in upon me , and I rioted in pleasures enhanced a thousandfold to me by the consciousness of my well - kept secret . I inherited an estate . The law -- the eagle - eyed law itself -- had been deceived , and had handed over disputed thousands to a madman ’s hands . Where was the wit of the sharp - sighted men of sound mind ? Where the dexterity of the lawyers , eager to discover a flaw ? The madman ’s cunning had overreached them all . ‘
66543	66586	66532	66532	They	2517	‘ Stay . If they had known it , would they have saved her ? A sister ’s happiness against her husband ’s gold . The lightest feather I blow into the air , against the gay chain that ornaments my body ! ‘
66705	66898	66681	66681	she	9813	‘ I do n’t remember forms or faces now , but I know the girl was beautiful . I know she was ; for in the bright moonlight nights , when I start up from my sleep , and all is quiet about me , I see , standing still and motionless in one corner of this cell , a slight and wasted figure with long black hair , which , streaming down her back , stirs with no earthly wind , and eyes that fix their gaze on me , and never wink or close . Hush ! the blood chills at my heart as I write it down -- that form is _ her ’s _ ; the face is very pale , and the eyes are glassy bright ; but I know them well . That figure never moves ; it never frowns and mouths as others do , that fill this place sometimes ; but it is much more dreadful to me , even than the spirits that tempted me many years ago -- it comes fresh from the grave ; and is so very death - like . ‘
67099	67220	67093	67093	I	0	‘ For many weeks I thought of poison , and then of drowning , and then of fire . A fine sight , the grand house in flames , and the madman ’s wife smouldering away to cinders . Think of the jest of a large reward , too , and of some sane man swinging in the wind for a deed he never did , and all through a madman ’s cunning ! I thought often of this , but I gave it up at last . Oh ! the pleasure of stropping the razor day after day , feeling the sharp edge , and thinking of the gash one stroke of its thin , bright edge would make ! ‘
67364	67497	67358	67358	She	2532	‘ One motion of my hand , and she would never again have uttered cry or sound . But I was startled , and drew back . Her eyes were fixed on mine . I knew not how it was , but they cowed and frightened me ; and I quailed beneath them . She rose from the bed , still gazing fixedly and steadily on me . I trembled ; the razor was in my hand , but I could not move . She made towards the door . As she neared it , she turned , and withdrew her eyes from my face . The spell was broken . I bounded forward , and clutched her by the arm . Uttering shriek upon shriek , she sank upon the ground . ‘
67543	67589	67590	67590	Doctors	2535	‘ They came , and raised her , and placed her on the bed . She lay bereft of animation for hours ; and when life , look , and speech returned , her senses had deserted her , and she raved wildly and furiously . ‘
67784	67865	67781	67781	my	0	‘ She died next day . The white - headed old man followed her to the grave , and the proud brothers dropped a tear over the insensible corpse of her whose sufferings they had regarded in her lifetime with muscles of iron . All this was food for my secret mirth , and I laughed behind the white handkerchief which I held up to my face , as we rode home , till the tears came into my eyes . ‘
68036	68253	68032	68033	a madman	11193	‘ I remember -- though it ’s one of the last things I can remember : for now I mix up realities with my dreams , and having so much to do , and being always hurried here , have no time to separate the two , from some strange confusion in which they get involved -- I remember how I let it out at last . Ha ! ha ! I think I see their frightened looks now , and feel the ease with which I flung them from me , and dashed my clenched fist into their white faces , and then flew like the wind , and left them screaming and shouting far behind . The strength of a giant comes upon me when I think of it . There -- see how this iron bar bends beneath my furious wrench . I could snap it like a twig , only there are long galleries here with many doors -- I do n’t think I could find my way along them ; and even if I could , I know there are iron gates below which they keep locked and barred . They know what a clever madman I have been , and they are proud to have me here , to show . ‘
68364	68502	68503	68504	This man	1282	‘ I kept my eyes carefully from him at first , for I knew what he little thought -- and I gloried in the knowledge -- that the light of madness gleamed from them like fire . We sat in silence for a few minutes . He spoke at last . My recent dissipation , and strange remarks , made so soon after his sister ’s death , were an insult to her memory . Coupling together many circumstances which had at first escaped his observation , he thought I had not treated her well . He wished to know whether he was right in inferring that I meant to cast a reproach upon her memory , and a disrespect upon her family . It was due to the uniform he wore , to demand this explanation . ‘
68608	68679	68602	68602	I	0	‘ I saw the sudden change that came upon him beneath my gaze . He was a bold man , but the colour faded from his face , and he drew back his chair . I dragged mine nearer to him ; and I laughed -- I was very merry then -- I saw him shudder . I felt the madness rising within me . He was afraid of me . ‘
68700	68724	68694	68694	I	0	‘ He looked uneasily round him , and I saw his hand grasp the back of his chair ; but he said nothing . ‘
68774	68808	68809	68809	I	0	‘ He jumped suddenly from his chair , brandished it aloft , and bid me stand back -- for I took care to be getting closer to him all the time I spoke . ‘
68839	68880	68881	68881	I	0	‘ “ Damn you , ” said I , starting up , and rushing upon him ; “ I killed her . I am a madman . Down with you . Blood , blood ! I will have it ! ” ‘
68914	69018	69031	69034	a crowd of people	2576	‘ It was a fine struggle that ; for he was a tall , strong man , fighting for his life ; and I , a powerful madman , thirsting to destroy him . I knew no strength could equal mine , and I was right . Right again , though a madman ! His struggles grew fainter . I knelt upon his chest , and clasped his brawny throat firmly with both hands . His face grew purple ; his eyes were starting from his head , and with protruded tongue , he seemed to mock me . I squeezed the tighter . ‘
69048	69127	69031	69034	a crowd of people	2576	‘ My secret was out ; and my only struggle now was for liberty and freedom . I gained my feet before a hand was on me , threw myself among my assailants , and cleared my way with my strong arm , as if I bore a hatchet in my hand , and hewed them down before me . I gained the door , dropped over the banisters , and in an instant was in the street . ‘
69414	70290	70294	70295	Mr. Stumps	368	’ At the end of the manuscript was written , in another hand , this note:-- [ The unhappy man whose ravings are recorded above , was a melancholy instance of the baneful results of energies misdirected in early life , and excesses prolonged until their consequences could never be repaired . The thoughtless riot , dissipation , and debauchery of his younger days produced fever and delirium . The first effects of the latter was the strange delusion , founded upon a well - known medical theory , strongly contended for by some , and as strongly contested by others , that an hereditary madness existed in his family . This produced a settled gloom , which in time developed a morbid insanity , and finally terminated in raving madness . There is every reason to believe that the events he detailed , though distorted in the description by his diseased imagination , really happened . It is only matter of wonder to those who were acquainted with the vices of his early career , that his passions , when no longer controlled by reason , did not lead him to the commission of still more frightful deeds . ] Mr. Pickwick ’s candle was just expiring in the socket , as he concluded the perusal of the old clergyman ’s manuscript ; and when the light went suddenly out , without any previous flicker by way of warning , it communicated a very considerable start to his excited frame . Hastily throwing off such articles of clothing as he had put on when he rose from his uneasy bed , and casting a fearful glance around , he once more scrambled hastily between the sheets , and soon fell fast asleep . The sun was shining brilliantly into his chamber , when he awoke , and the morning was far advanced . The gloom which had oppressed him on the previous night had disappeared with the dark shadows which shrouded the landscape , and his thoughts and feelings were as light and gay as the morning itself . After a hearty breakfast , the four gentlemen sallied forth to walk to Gravesend , followed by a man bearing the stone in its deal box . They reached the town about one o’clock ( their luggage they had directed to be forwarded to the city , from Rochester ) , and being fortunate enough to secure places on the outside of a coach , arrived in London in sound health and spirits , on that same afternoon . The next three or four days were occupied with the preparations which were necessary for their journey to the borough of Eatanswill . As any references to that most important undertaking demands a separate chapter , we may devote the few lines which remain at the close of this , to narrate , with great brevity , the history of the antiquarian discovery . It appears from the Transactions of the Club , then , that Mr. Pickwick lectured upon the discovery at a General Club Meeting , convened on the night succeeding their return , and entered into a variety of ingenious and erudite speculations on the meaning of the inscription . It also appears that a skilful artist executed a faithful delineation of the curiosity , which was engraven on stone , and presented to the Royal Antiquarian Society , and other learned bodies : that heart - burnings and jealousies without number were created by rival controversies which were penned upon the subject ; and that Mr. Pickwick himself wrote a pamphlet , containing ninety - six pages of very small print , and twenty - seven different readings of the inscription : that three old gentlemen cut off their eldest sons with a shilling a - piece for presuming to doubt the antiquity of the fragment ; and that one enthusiastic individual cut himself off prematurely , in despair at being unable to fathom its meaning : that Mr. Pickwick was elected an honorary member of seventeen native and foreign societies , for making the discovery : that none of the seventeen could make anything of it ; but that all the seventeen agreed it was very extraordinary . Mr. Blotton , indeed -- and the name will be doomed to the undying contempt of those who cultivate the mysterious and the sublime -- Mr. Blotton , we say , with the doubt and cavilling peculiar to vulgar minds , presumed to state a view of the case , as degrading as ridiculous . Mr. Blotton , with a mean desire to tarnish the lustre of the immortal name of Pickwick , actually undertook a journey to Cobham in person , and on his return , sarcastically observed in an oration at the club , that he had seen the man from whom the stone was purchased ; that the man presumed the stone to be ancient , but solemnly denied the antiquity of the inscription-- inasmuch as he represented it to have been rudely carved by himself in an idle mood , and to display letters intended to bear neither more or less than the simple construction of--‘BILL STUMPS , HIS MARK ’

73227	73383	73155	73161	the landlady o ’ the White Hart	11319	’ With the single exception of one amiable indiscretion , in which an assistant housemaid had equally participated , the history of Mr. Weller ’s conduct was so very blameless , that Mr. Pickwick felt fully justified in closing the engagement that very evening . With the promptness and energy which characterised not only the public proceedings , but all the private actions of this extraordinary man , he at once led his new attendant to one of those convenient emporiums where gentlemen ’s new and second - hand clothes are provided , and the troublesome and inconvenient formality of measurement dispensed with ; and before night had closed in , Mr. Weller was furnished with a grey coat with the P. C. button , a black hat with a cockade to it , a pink striped waistcoat , light breeches and gaiters , and a variety of other necessaries , too numerous to recapitulate . ‘
73386	73409	73155	73161	the landlady o ’ the White Hart	11319	’ said that suddenly - transformed individual , as he took his seat on the outside of the Eatanswill coach next morning ; ‘
73414	73444	73482	73482	I	0	’m meant to be a footman , or a groom , or a gamekeeper , or a seedsman . I looks like a sort of compo of every one on ‘
73484	74200	73482	73482	I	0	’ CHAPTER XIII . SOME ACCOUNT OF EATANSWILL ; OF THE STATE OF PARTIES THEREIN ; AND OF THE ELECTION OF A MEMBER TO SERVE IN PARLIAMENT FOR THAT ANCIENT , LOYAL , AND PATRIOTIC BOROUGH We will frankly acknowledge that , up to the period of our being first immersed in the voluminous papers of the Pickwick Club , we had never heard of Eatanswill ; we will with equal candour admit that we have in vain searched for proof of the actual existence of such a place at the present day . Knowing the deep reliance to be placed on every note and statement of Mr. Pickwick ’s , and not presuming to set up our recollection against the recorded declarations of that great man , we have consulted every authority , bearing upon the subject , to which we could possibly refer . We have traced every name in schedules A and B , without meeting with that of Eatanswill ; we have minutely examined every corner of the pocket county maps issued for the benefit of society by our distinguished publishers , and the same result has attended our investigation . We are therefore led to believe that Mr. Pickwick , with that anxious desire to abstain from giving offence to any , and with those delicate feelings for which all who knew him well know he was so eminently remarkable , purposely substituted a fictitious designation , for the real name of the place in which his observations were made . We are confirmed in this belief by a little circumstance , apparently slight and trivial in itself , but when considered in this point of view , not undeserving of notice . In Mr. Pickwick ’s note - book , we can just trace an entry of the fact , that the places of himself and followers were booked by the Norwich coach ; but this entry was afterwards lined through , as if for the purpose of concealing even the direction in which the borough is situated . We will not , therefore , hazard a guess upon the subject , but will at once proceed with this history , content with the materials which its characters have provided for us . It appears , then , that the Eatanswill people , like the people of many other small towns , considered themselves of the utmost and most mighty importance , and that every man in Eatanswill , conscious of the weight that attached to his example , felt himself bound to unite , heart and soul , with one of the two great parties that divided the town -- the Blues and the Buffs . Now the Blues lost no opportunity of opposing the Buffs , and the Buffs lost no opportunity of opposing the Blues ; and the consequence was , that whenever the Buffs and Blues met together at public meeting , town - hall , fair , or market , disputes and high words arose between them . With these dissensions it is almost superfluous to say that everything in Eatanswill was made a party question . If the Buffs proposed to new skylight the market - place , the Blues got up public meetings , and denounced the proceeding ; if the Blues proposed the erection of an additional pump in the High Street , the Buffs rose as one man and stood aghast at the enormity . There were Blue shops and Buff shops , Blue inns and Buff inns -- there was a Blue aisle and a Buff aisle in the very church itself . Of course it was essentially and indispensably necessary that each of these powerful parties should have its chosen organ and representative : and , accordingly , there were two newspapers in the town -- the Eatanswill _ Gazette _ and the Eatanswill _ Independent _ ; the former advocating Blue principles , and the latter conducted on grounds decidedly Buff . Fine newspapers they were .

74744	74748	74750	74751	the crowd	9730	‘ No Fizkin ! ’
74753	74757	74759	74760	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Certainly not ! ’
74762	74765	74759	74760	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Hurrah ! ’
74791	74796	74798	74799	Mr. Tupman	244	‘ Who is Slumkey ? ’
74801	74807	74809	74810	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I do n’t know , ’
74817	74840	74809	74810	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Hush . Do n’t ask any questions . It ’s always best on these occasions to do what the mob do . ’
74841	74849	74851	74852	Mr. Snodgrass	242	‘ But suppose there are two mobs ? ’
74854	74860	74862	74863	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Shout with the largest , ’
74905	74912	74914	74915	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Can we have beds here ? ’
74921	74928	74930	74931	the man	835	‘ Do n’t know , Sir , ’
74933	74936	74930	74931	the man	835	‘ afraid we ’re
74946	74964	74944	74944	Sir	9716	’ Away he went for that purpose , and presently returned , to ask whether the gentleman were ‘
74967	75011	74944	74944	Sir	9716	’ As neither Mr. Pickwick nor his companions took any vital interest in the cause of either candidate , the question was rather a difficult one to answer . In this dilemma Mr. Pickwick bethought himself of his new friend , Mr. Perker . ‘
75023	75028	75015	75021	a gentleman of the name of Perker	2702	’ inquired Mr. Pickwick . ‘
75040	75041	75042	75042	He	2702	’ ‘
75049	75050	75046	75046	I	0	’ ‘
75057	75058	75055	75055	Sir	9716	’ ‘
75066	75158	75061	75061	we	2706	’ said Mr. Pickwick ; but observing that the man looked rather doubtful at this accommodating announcement , he gave him his card , and desired him to present it to Mr. Perker forthwith , if he should happen to be in the house . The waiter retired ; and reappearing almost immediately with a request that Mr. Pickwick would follow him , led the way to a large room on the first floor , where , seated at a long table covered with books and papers , was Mr. Perker . ‘
75167	75178	75163	75165	my dear Sir	1228	’ said the little man , advancing to meet him ; ‘
75215	75223	75204	75204	You	1228	’ Mr. Pickwick replied in the affirmative . ‘
75231	75237	75238	75238	I	0	’ said the little man . ‘
75239	75245	75247	75248	Mr. Pickwick	240	’m delighted to hear it , ’
75254	75278	75247	75248	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I like to see sturdy patriotism , on whatever side it is called forth -- and so it ’s a spirited contest ? ’
75279	75284	75286	75288	the little man	2005	‘ Oh , yes , ’
75290	75331	75286	75288	the little man	2005	‘ very much so indeed . We have opened all the public - houses in the place , and left our adversary nothing but the beer - shops -- masterly stroke of policy that , my dear Sir , eh ? ’
75346	75360	75362	75363	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ And what are the probabilities as to the result of the contest ? ’
75365	75379	75381	75383	the little man	2005	‘ Why , doubtful , my dear Sir ; rather doubtful as yet , ’
75385	75410	75381	75383	the little man	2005	‘ Fizkin ’s people have got three - and - thirty voters in the lock - up coach - house at the White Hart . ’
75411	75418	75420	75421	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ In the coach - house ! ’
75432	75435	75381	75383	the little man	2005	‘ They keep ‘
75443	75446	75448	75450	the little man	2005	‘ em , ’
75452	75502	75448	75450	the little man	2005	‘ The effect of that is , you see , to prevent our getting at them ; and even if we could , it would be of no use , for they keep them very drunk on purpose . Smart fellow Fizkin ’s agent -- very smart fellow indeed . ’
75511	75519	75521	75522	Mr. Perker	362	‘ We are pretty confident , though , ’
75532	75560	75561	75561	em	2716	‘ We had a little tea - party here , last night -- five- and - forty women , my dear sir -- and gave every one of ‘
75570	75571	75561	75561	em	2716	’ ‘
75575	75580	75561	75561	em	2716	’ said Mr. Pickwick . ‘
75676	75818	75656	75656	you	10214	’ Here the little man indulged in a convulsion of mirth , which was only checked by the entrance of a third party . This was a tall , thin man , with a sandy - coloured head inclined to baldness , and a face in which solemn importance was blended with a look of unfathomable profundity . He was dressed in a long brown surtout , with a black cloth waistcoat , and drab trousers . A double eyeglass dangled at his waistcoat ; and on his head he wore a very low - crowned hat with a broad brim . The new - comer was introduced to Mr. Pickwick as Mr. Pott , the editor of the Eatanswill _ Gazette _ . After a few preliminary remarks , Mr. Pott turned round to Mr. Pickwick , and said with solemnity-- ‘
75830	75831	75828	75828	sir	9716	’ ‘
75837	75842	75828	75828	sir	9716	’ said Mr. Pickwick . ‘
75851	75878	75828	75828	sir	9716	’ said Pott , looking towards Mr. Perker for corroboration--‘to which I have reason to know that my article of last Saturday in some degree contributed . ’
75879	75887	75889	75891	the little man	2005	‘ Not the least doubt of it , ’
75893	75903	75905	75905	Pott	382	‘ The press is a mighty engine , sir , ’
75917	75924	75926	75926	Pott	382	‘ But I trust , sir , ’
75928	76012	75926	75926	Pott	382	‘ that I have never abused the enormous power I wield . I trust , sir , that I have never pointed the noble instrument which is placed in my hands , against the sacred bosom of private life , or the tender breast of individual reputation ; I trust , sir , that I have devoted my energies to -- to endeavours -- humble they may be , humble I know they are -- to instil those principles of -- which -- are-- ’
76036	76039	76027	76028	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Certainly . ’
76040	76046	76048	76048	Pott--‘what	383	‘ And what , Sir , ’
76082	76083	76027	76028	Mr. Pickwick	240	’ ‘
76090	76106	76027	76028	Mr. Pickwick	240	’ interposed Mr. Perker , with a look of slyness which was very likely accidental . ‘
76110	76114	76027	76028	Mr. Pickwick	240	’ said Pott , ‘
76242	76251	76253	76254	Mr. Pickwick	240	’ Your conduct is most noble , Sir , ’
76266	76282	76284	76285	Mr. Pott	382	‘ You are , sir , I perceive , a man of sense and talent , ’
76297	76314	76284	76285	Mr. Pott	382	‘ I am most happy , sir , to make the acquaintance of such a man . ’
76315	76319	76321	76322	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ And I , ’
76324	76363	76321	76322	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ feel deeply honoured by this expression of your opinion . Allow me , sir , to introduce you to my fellow - travellers , the other corresponding members of the club I am proud to have founded . ’
76364	76370	76372	76373	Mr. Pott	382	‘ I shall be delighted , ’
76400	76407	76409	76411	little Mr. Perker	362	‘ Now , my dear Pott , ’
76413	76428	76409	76411	little Mr. Perker	362	‘ the question is , what are we to do with our friends here ? ’
76429	76440	76442	76443	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ We can stop in this house , I suppose , ’
76445	76463	76442	76443	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Not a spare bed in the house , my dear sir -- not a single bed . ’
76464	76468	76470	76471	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Extremely awkward , ’
76473	76476	76470	76471	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Very , ’
76483	76492	76494	76495	Mr. Pott	382	‘ I have an idea upon this subject , ’
76497	76566	76494	76495	Mr. Pott	382	‘ which I think may be very successfully adopted . They have two beds at the Peacock , and I can boldly say , on behalf of Mrs. Pott , that she will be delighted to accommodate Mr. Pickwick and any one of his friends , if the other two gentlemen and their servant do not object to shifting , as they best can , at the Peacock . ’
76802	76806	76808	76809	Mr. Pott	382	‘ My dear , ’
76811	76820	76808	76809	Mr. Pott	382	‘ Mr. Pickwick -- Mr. Pickwick of London . ’
76859	76866	76837	76838	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ P. my dear’--said Mrs. Pott . ‘
76870	76875	76878	76880	the other gentleman	10604	’ said Mr. Pott . ‘

76915	76928	76913	76913	Winkle	276	’ echoed Mr. Pott ; and the ceremony of introduction was complete . ‘
76937	76942	76935	76935	ma’am	10369	’ said Mr. Pickwick , ‘
76954	76955	76935	76935	ma’am	10369	’ ‘
76966	76975	76958	76958	you	11004	’ replied the feminine Pott , with vivacity . ‘

77025	77031	77020	77020	Nobody	1826	’ exclaimed Mr. Pott archly . ‘
77036	77044	77034	77034	you	11004	’ retorted Mrs. Pott , with asperity . ‘
77051	77063	77048	77049	Mr. Pickwick	240	’ said the host in explanation of his wife ’s lament , ‘

77324	77337	77322	77322	Jane	306	’ said Mr. Pott , to the servant who brought in candles , ‘
77368	77412	77363	77363	I	0	’ added the editor , turning to Mr. Pickwick--‘I’ll just read you a few of the leaders I wrote at that time upon the Buff job of appointing a new tollman to the turnpike here ; I rather think they ’ll amuse you . ’
77413	77424	77426	77427	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I should like to hear them very much indeed , ’
77592	77598	77578	77578	she	384	‘ a delightful old dear . ’

78059	78063	78056	78056	Wery	2794	’ replied Sam ; ‘

78385	78413	78415	78415	Sam	240	‘ Not half so strange as a miraculous circumstance as happened to my own father , at an election time , in this wery place , Sir , ’
78417	78422	78424	78425	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ What was that ? ’
78427	78438	78440	78440	Sam	240	‘ Why , he drove a coach down here once , ’

78694	78778	78673	78674	my father.--“You	2817	‘ un , ” says my father.--“I thought so , ” says the gen’l’m’n . So then they pours him out a glass of wine , and gammons him about his driving , and gets him into a reg’lar good humour , and at last shoves a twenty - pound note into his hand . “ It ’s a wery bad road between this and London , ” says the gen’l’m’n.--“Here and there it is a heavy road , ” says my father.-- ” ‘
78793	78813	78832	78832	We	2820	‘ ere , ” says my father.-- “ Well , Mr. Weller , ” says the gen’l’m’n , “ you ’re

78950	78972	78938	78938	Sam	356	‘ that on the wery day as he came down with them woters , his coach _ was _ upset on that ‘

78990	78996	78998	78999	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ And got out again ? ’

79097	79102	79061	79062	that gen’l’m’n	2824	’ said Mr. Pickwick . ‘
79120	79246	79113	79114	Mr. Winkle	276	’ With these words Mr. Pickwick descended to the parlour , where he found breakfast laid , and the family already assembled . The meal was hastily despatched ; each of the gentlemen ’s hats was decorated with an enormous blue favour , made up by the fair hands of Mrs. Pott herself ; and as Mr. Winkle had undertaken to escort that lady to a house - top , in the immediate vicinity of the hustings , Mr. Pickwick and Mr. Pott repaired alone to the Town Arms , from the back window of which , one of Mr. Slumkey ’s committee was addressing six small boys and one girl , whom he dignified , at every second sentence , with the imposing title of ‘
79251	79541	79113	79114	Mr. Winkle	276	’ whereat the six small boys aforesaid cheered prodigiously . The stable - yard exhibited unequivocal symptoms of the glory and strength of the Eatanswill Blues . There was a regular army of blue flags , some with one handle , and some with two , exhibiting appropriate devices , in golden characters four feet high , and stout in proportion . There was a grand band of trumpets , bassoons , and drums , marshalled four abreast , and earning their money , if ever men did , especially the drum - beaters , who were very muscular . There were bodies of constables with blue staves , twenty committee - men with blue scarfs , and a mob of voters with blue cockades . There were electors on horseback and electors afoot . There was an open carriage - and - four , for the Honourable Samuel Slumkey ; and there were four carriage - and - pair , for his friends and supporters ; and the flags were rustling , and the band was playing , and the constables were swearing , and the twenty committee - men were squabbling , and the mob were shouting , and the horses were backing , and the post- boys perspiring ; and everybody , and everything , then and there assembled , was for the special use , behoof , honour , and renown , of the Honourable Samuel Slumkey , of Slumkey Hall , one of the candidates for the representation of the borough of Eatanswill , in the Commons House of Parliament of the United Kingdom . Loud and long were the cheers , and mighty was the rustling of one of the blue flags , with ‘
79546	79621	79113	79114	Mr. Winkle	276	’ inscribed thereon , when the sandy head of Mr. Pott was discerned in one of the windows , by the mob beneath ; and tremendous was the enthusiasm when the Honourable Samuel Slumkey himself , in top - boots , and a blue neckerchief , advanced and seized the hand of the said Pott , and melodramatically testified by gestures to the crowd , his ineffaceable obligations to the Eatanswill _ Gazette _ . ‘
79626	79636	79113	79114	Mr. Winkle	276	’ said the Honourable Samuel Slumkey to Mr. Perker . ‘
79643	79651	79641	79641	Sir	9716	’ was the little man ’s reply . ‘
79660	79667	79657	79657	I	0	’ said the Honourable Samuel Slumkey . ‘
79704	79739	79703	79703	you	9716	’re to pat on the head , and inquire the age of ; be particular about the children , my dear sir -- it has always a great effect , that sort of thing . ’
79740	79746	79748	79751	the Honourable Samuel Slumkey	377	‘ I ’ll take care , ’
79753	79762	79764	79767	the cautious little man	2831	‘ And , perhaps , my dear Sir , ’
79769	79794	79764	79767	the cautious little man	2831	‘ perhaps if you could -- I do n’t mean to say it ’s indispensable -- but if you could manage to kiss one of ‘
79808	79809	79764	79767	the cautious little man	2831	’ ‘
79826	79833	79819	79822	the proposer or seconder	2833	’ said the Honourable Samuel Slumkey . ‘
79843	79848	79836	79836	I	0	’ replied the agent ; ‘
79869	79870	79860	79860	I	0	’ ‘
79874	79886	79860	79860	I	0	’ said the Honourable Samuel Slumkey , with a resigned air , ‘
79897	79898	79836	79836	I	0	’ ‘
79903	80029	80030	80030	He	2835	’ cried the twenty committee - men . Amidst the cheers of the assembled throng , the band , and the constables , and the committee - men , and the voters , and the horsemen , and the carriages , took their places -- each of the two - horse vehicles being closely packed with as many gentlemen as could manage to stand upright in it ; and that assigned to Mr. Perker , containing Mr. Pickwick , Mr. Tupman , Mr. Snodgrass , and about half a dozen of the committee besides . There was a moment of awful suspense as the procession waited for the Honourable Samuel Slumkey to step into his carriage . Suddenly the crowd set up a great cheering . ‘
80035	80067	80068	80068	He	2835	’ said little Mr. Perker , greatly excited ; the more so as their position did not enable them to see what was going forward . Another cheer , much louder . ‘
80076	80089	80090	80090	He	2835	’ cried the little agent . Another cheer , far more vehement . ‘
80099	80117	80118	80118	He	2835	’ said Mr. Perker , trembling with anxiety . A roar of applause that rent the air . ‘
80123	80126	80128	80131	the delighted little man	2838	‘ em ! ’
80137	80143	80145	80147	the excited manager	2839	‘ He has kissed another , ’
80153	80157	80158	80158	em	10159	‘ He ’s kissing ‘
80161	80478	80158	80158	em	10159	’ screamed the enthusiastic little gentleman , and hailed by the deafening shouts of the multitude , the procession moved on . How or by what means it became mixed up with the other procession , and how it was ever extricated from the confusion consequent thereupon , is more than we can undertake to describe , inasmuch as Mr. Pickwick ’s hat was knocked over his eyes , nose , and mouth , by one poke of a Buff flag- staff , very early in the proceedings . He describes himself as being surrounded on every side , when he could catch a glimpse of the scene , by angry and ferocious countenances , by a vast cloud of dust , and by a dense crowd of combatants . He represents himself as being forced from the carriage by some unseen power , and being personally engaged in a pugilistic encounter ; but with whom , or how , or why , he is wholly unable to state . He then felt himself forced up some wooden steps by the persons from behind ; and on removing his hat , found himself surrounded by his friends , in the very front of the left hand side of the hustings . The right was reserved for the Buff party , and the centre for the mayor and his officers ; one of whom -- the fat crier of Eatanswill -- was ringing an enormous bell , by way of commanding silence , while Mr. Horatio Fizkin , and the Honourable Samuel Slumkey , with their hands upon their hearts , were bowing with the utmost affability to the troubled sea of heads that inundated the open space in front ; and from whence arose a storm of groans , and shouts , and yells , and hootings , that would have done honour to an earthquake . ‘
80483	80495	80481	80481	Winkle	276	’ said Mr. Tupman , pulling his friend by the sleeve . ‘
80498	80518	80481	80481	Winkle	276	’ said Mr. Pickwick , putting on his spectacles , which he had fortunately kept in his pocket hitherto . ‘
80521	80526	80481	80481	Winkle	276	’ said Mr. Tupman , ‘
80534	80617	80481	80481	Winkle	276	’ And there , sure enough , in the leaden gutter of a tiled roof , were Mr. Winkle and Mrs. Pott , comfortably seated in a couple of chairs , waving their handkerchiefs in token of recognition -- a compliment which Mr. Pickwick returned by kissing his hand to the lady . The proceedings had not yet commenced ; and as an inactive crowd is generally disposed to be jocose , this very innocent action was sufficient to awaken their facetiousness . ‘
80625	80630	80620	80623	you wicked old rascal	2842	’ cried one voice , ‘
80639	80640	80637	80637	you	2841	’ ‘
80647	80651	80654	80654	his	2845	’ cried another . ‘
80661	80664	80666	80667	a third	2846	‘ ooman ! ’
80669	80676	80681	80681	his	2845	‘ I see him a - winkin ’
80686	80691	80681	80681	his	2845	’ shouted a fourth . ‘
80699	80796	80697	80697	Pott	384	’ bellowed a fifth -- and then there was a roar of laughter . As these taunts were accompanied with invidious comparisons between Mr. Pickwick and an aged ram , and several witticisms of the like nature ; and as they moreover rather tended to convey reflections upon the honour of an innocent lady , Mr. Pickwick ’s indignation was excessive ; but as silence was proclaimed at the moment , he contented himself by scorching the mob with a look of pity for their misguided minds , at which they laughed more boisterously than ever . ‘
80799	80806	80918	80919	the crowd	9730	’ roared the mayor ’s attendants . ‘
80812	80849	80918	80919	the crowd	9730	’ said the mayor , with an air of pomp befitting his lofty station . In obedience to this command the crier performed another concerto on the bell , whereupon a gentleman in the crowd called out ‘
80851	80858	80859	80859	Gentlemen	10163	’ ; which occasioned another laugh . ‘
80861	80908	80859	80859	Gentlemen	10163	’ said the mayor , at as loud a pitch as he could possibly force his voice to--‘gentlemen . Brother electors of the borough of Eatanswill . We are met here to - day for the purpose of choosing a representative in the room of our late-- ’
80921	80929	80918	80919	the crowd	9730	‘ Suc - cess to the mayor ! ’
80934	80953	80918	80919	the crowd	9730	‘ and may he never desert the nail and sarspan business , as he got his money by . ’
81056	81075	81092	81092	he	2853	‘ send a boy home , to ask whether he had n’t left his voice under the pillow , ’
82588	82591	82558	82559	the Peacock	62	‘ commercial room ’
82953	82958	82960	82967	a stout , hale personage of about forty	2942	‘ Well , gents , ’
82993	83019	82960	82967	a stout , hale personage of about forty	2942	‘ our noble selves , gents . I always propose that toast to the company , and drink Mary to myself . Eh , Mary ! ’
83020	83029	83031	83034	the hand - maiden	2943	‘ Get along with you , you wretch , ’
83047	83055	83057	83061	the black - eyed man	2944	‘ Do n’t go away , Mary , ’
83063	83070	83072	83074	the young lady	2945	‘ Let me alone , imperence , ’
83076	83080	83082	83086	the one - eyed man	2946	‘ Never mind , ’
83098	83116	83118	83118	he	2946	‘ I ’ll step out by and by , Mary . Keep your spirits up , dear . ’
83153	83159	83161	83165	the dirty - faced man	2951	‘ Rum creeters is women , ’
83171	83179	83181	83190	a very red - faced man , behind a cigar	2952	‘ Ah ! no mistake about that , ’
83203	83218	83220	83225	the man with the black eye	2953	‘ There ’s rummer things than women in this world though , mind you , ’
83240	83245	83247	83251	the dirty - faced man	2951	‘ Are you married ? ’
83253	83260	83247	83251	the dirty - faced man	2951	‘ Ca n’t say I am . ’
83261	83266	83268	83272	the dirty - faced man	2951	‘ I thought not . ’
83309	83317	83319	83322	the enthusiastic Mr. Snodgrass	242	‘ Women , after all , gentlemen , ’
83324	83335	83319	83322	the enthusiastic Mr. Snodgrass	242	‘ are the great props and comforts of our existence . ’
83336	83341	83343	83345	the placid gentleman	2958	‘ So they are , ’
83347	83350	83343	83345	the placid gentleman	2958	‘ When they ’re
83356	83364	83343	83345	the placid gentleman	2958	’ interposed the dirty - faced man . ‘
83371	83377	83378	83378	I	0	’ said the placid one . ‘
83383	83397	83398	83398	I	0	’ said Mr. Snodgrass , whose thoughts were fast reverting to Emily Wardle . ‘
83430	83451	83424	83424	he	2959	’ And Mr. Snodgrass took his cigar from his mouth , and struck the table violently with his clenched fist . ‘
83458	83464	83424	83424	he	2959	’ said the placid man . ‘
83472	83480	83469	83469	I	0	’ interrupted he of the dirty countenance . ‘
83499	83505	83506	83506	Your	0	’ said the placid gentleman . ‘
83511	83534	83509	83509	Sir	9716	’ said the bagman with the lonely eye , bestowing an approving nod on Mr. Snodgrass . Mr. Snodgrass acknowledged the compliment . ‘
83544	83549	83509	83509	Sir	9716	’ continued the bagman , ‘
83608	83609	83593	83593	me	0	’ ‘
83619	83630	83632	83632	you	0	’ said the red - faced man with the cigar . ‘
83634	83651	83632	83632	you	0	’ was the only reply of the bagman , who continued to smoke with great vehemence . ‘
83656	83678	83654	83654	I	0	’ said Mr. Tupman , speaking for the first time . He was always anxious to increase his stock of experience . ‘
83706	83724	83700	83700	you	0	’ said the man with the roguish eye , making that organ look more roguish than ever . ‘
83737	83742	83734	83734	I	0	’ said Mr. Tupman . ‘
83753	83758	83748	83748	I	0	’ replied the traveller . ‘
83847	83861	83840	83840	he	2974	’S STORY and he used to tell it , something in this way . ‘
84136	84209	84129	84129	nobody	1826	‘ There are many pleasanter places even in this dreary world , than Marlborough Downs when it blows hard ; and if you throw in beside , a gloomy winter ’s evening , a miry and sloppy road , and a pelting fall of heavy rain , and try the effect , by way of experiment , in your own proper person , you will experience the full force of this observation . ‘
84405	84598	84610	84611	Tom Smart	248	‘ The bay mare splashed away , through the mud and water , with drooping ears ; now and then tossing her head as if to express her disgust at this very ungentlemanly behaviour of the elements , but keeping a good pace notwithstanding , until a gust of wind , more furious than any that had yet assailed them , caused her to stop suddenly and plant her four feet firmly against the ground , to prevent her being blown over . It ’s a special mercy that she did this , for if she _ had _ been blown over , the vixenish mare was so light , and the gig was so light , and Tom Smart such a light weight into the bargain , that they must infallibly have all gone rolling over and over together , until they reached the confines of earth , or until the wind fell ; and in either case the probability is , that neither the vixenish mare , nor the clay - coloured gig with the red wheels , nor Tom Smart , would ever have been fit for service again . ‘
84641	84710	84716	84717	Tom Smart	248	‘ You ’ll very likely ask me why , as Tom Smart had been pretty well blown already , he expressed this wish to be submitted to the same process again . I ca n’t say -- all I know is , that Tom Smart said so -- or at least he always told my uncle he said so , and it ’s just the same thing . “ ‘
84734	84806	84725	84725	she	3000	‘ Cheer up , old girl , ” said Tom , patting the bay mare on the neck with the end of his whip . “ It wo n’t do pushing on , such a night as this ; the first house we come to we ’ll put up at , so the faster you go the sooner it ’s over . Soho , old girl -- gently -- gently . ” ‘
84956	85169	84920	84920	she	3001	‘ Tom cast a hasty glance at the upper part of the house as he threw the reins to the hostler , and stuck the whip in the box . It was a strange old place , built of a kind of shingle , inlaid , as it were , with cross- beams , with gabled - topped windows projecting completely over the pathway , and a low door with a dark porch , and a couple of steep steps leading down into the house , instead of the modern fashion of half a dozen shallow ones leading up to it . It was a comfortable - looking place though , for there was a strong , cheerful light in the bar window , which shed a bright ray across the road , and even lighted up the hedge on the other side ; and there was a red flickering light in the opposite window , one moment but faintly discernible , and the next gleaming strongly through the drawn curtains , which intimated that a rousing fire was blazing within . Marking these little evidences with the eye of an experienced traveller , Tom dismounted with as much agility as his half- frozen limbs would permit , and entered the house . ‘
85175	85561	85562	85563	Tom Smart	248	’ time , Tom was ensconced in the room opposite the bar -- the very room where he had imagined the fire blazing -- before a substantial , matter - of - fact , roaring fire , composed of something short of a bushel of coals , and wood enough to make half a dozen decent gooseberry bushes , piled half - way up the chimney , and roaring and crackling with a sound that of itself would have warmed the heart of any reasonable man . This was comfortable , but this was not all ; for a smartly - dressed girl , with a bright eye and a neat ankle , was laying a very clean white cloth on the table ; and as Tom sat with his slippered feet on the fender , and his back to the open door , he saw a charming prospect of the bar reflected in the glass over the chimney - piece , with delightful rows of green bottles and gold labels , together with jars of pickles and preserves , and cheeses and boiled hams , and rounds of beef , arranged on shelves in the most tempting and delicious array . Well , this was comfortable too ; but even this was not all -- for in the bar , seated at tea at the nicest possible little table , drawn close up before the brightest possible little fire , was a buxom widow of somewhere about eight - and - forty or thereabouts , with a face as comfortable as the bar , who was evidently the landlady of the house , and the supreme ruler over all these agreeable possessions . There was only one drawback to the beauty of the whole picture , and that was a tall man -- a very tall man-- in a brown coat and bright basket buttons , and black whiskers and wavy black hair , who was seated at tea with the widow , and who it required no great penetration to discover was in a fair way of persuading her to be a widow no longer , but to confer upon him the privilege of sitting down in that bar , for and during the whole remainder of the term of his natural life . ‘
85881	85974	85877	85879	the tall man	3008	‘ “ Confound his impudence ! ” said Tom to himself , “ what business has he in that snug bar ? Such an ugly villain too ! ” said Tom . “ If the widow had any taste , she might surely pick up some better fellow than that . ” Here Tom ’s eye wandered from the glass on the chimney - piece to the glass on the table ; and as he felt himself becoming gradually sentimental , he emptied the fourth tumbler of punch and ordered a fifth . ‘
86196	86352	86168	86169	Tom Smart	248	‘ Up a wide and ancient staircase the smart girl preceded Tom , shading the chamber candle with her hand , to protect it from the currents of air which in such a rambling old place might have found plenty of room to disport themselves in , without blowing the candle out , but which did blow it out nevertheless -- thus affording Tom ’s enemies an opportunity of asserting that it was he , and not the wind , who extinguished the candle , and that while he pretended to be blowing it alight again , he was in fact kissing the girl . Be this as it may , another light was obtained , and Tom was conducted through a maze of rooms , and a labyrinth of passages , to the apartment which had been prepared for his reception , where the girl bade him good - night and left him alone . ‘
86563	86670	86554	86554	he	248	‘ “ Well , ” said Tom , slowly undressing himself , and staring at the old chair all the while , which stood with a mysterious aspect by the bedside , “ I never saw such a rum concern as that in my days . Very odd , ” said Tom , who had got rather sage with the hot punch--“very odd . ” Tom shook his head with an air of profound wisdom , and looked at the chair again . He could n’t make anything of it though , so he got into bed , covered himself up warm , and fell asleep . ‘
86712	86780	86802	86802	Tom	248	‘ “ I wo n’t look at it any more , ” said Tom to himself , and he squeezed his eyelids together , and tried to persuade himself he was going to sleep again . No use ; nothing but queer chairs danced before his eyes , kicking up their legs , jumping over each other ’s backs , and playing all kinds of antics . “ ‘
86832	86962	86963	86963	Tom	248	‘ Tom gazed at the chair ; and , suddenly as he looked at it , a most extraordinary change seemed to come over it . The carving of the back gradually assumed the lineaments and expression of an old , shrivelled human face ; the damask cushion became an antique , flapped waistcoat ; the round knobs grew into a couple of feet , encased in red cloth slippers ; and the whole chair looked like a very ugly old man , of the previous century , with his arms akimbo . Tom sat up in bed , and rubbed his eyes to dispel the illusion . No . The chair was an ugly old gentleman ; and what was more , he was winking at Tom Smart . ‘
87054	87067	87046	87046	Tom	248	‘ “ What the devil are you winking at me for ? ” ‘
87111	87144	87094	87094	He	10238	‘ “ How do you know my name , old nut - cracker face ? ” inquired Tom Smart , rather staggered ; though he pretended to carry it off so well . ‘
87204	87236	87193	87193	he	10238	‘ “ I did n’t mean to treat you with any disrespect , Sir , ” said Tom , in a much humbler tone than he had spoken in at first . ‘
87257	87261	87255	87255	Tom--	393	‘ “ Sir-- ” ‘
87274	87281	87244	87246	the old fellow	3038	’re very poor , Tom . ” ‘
87302	87316	87289	87290	Tom Smart	248	‘ “ Never mind that , ” said the old gentleman ; “ you ’re
87326	87370	87376	87378	the old gentleman	10238	‘ Tom Smart was just on the point of protesting that he had n’t tasted a drop since his last birthday , but when his eye encountered that of the old gentleman he looked so knowing that Tom blushed , and was silent . ‘
87441	87456	87463	87464	Tom Smart	248	‘ “ I am her guardian , Tom , ” said the old gentleman . ‘
87466	87501	87463	87464	Tom Smart	248	‘ “ I knew her mother , Tom , ” said the old fellow : “ and her grandmother . She was very fond of me -- made me this waistcoat , Tom . ” ‘
87511	87598	87508	87509	Tom Smart	248	‘ “ And these shoes , ” said the old fellow , lifting up one of the red cloth mufflers ; “ but do n’t mention it , Tom . I should n’t like to have it known that she was so much attached to me . It might occasion some unpleasantness in the family . ” When the old rascal said this , he looked so extremely impertinent , that , as Tom Smart afterwards declared , he could have sat upon him without remorse . ‘
87681	87703	87664	87664	he	10238	‘ “ Just serves you right , old boy , ” thought Tom Smart ; but he did n’t say anything . ‘
87767	87782	87788	87790	the old gentleman	10238	‘ “ I dare say you did , Sir , ” said Tom Smart . ‘
87810	87820	87826	87828	the old gentleman	10238	‘ “ Me , Sir ! ” said Tom . ‘
87830	87872	87826	87828	the old gentleman	10238	‘ “ Bless your reverend locks , ” said Tom ( he had a few scattered horse- hairs left)--“bless your reverend locks , she would n’t have me . ” And Tom sighed involuntarily , as he thought of the bar . ‘
87885	87918	87880	87882	the old gentleman	10238	‘ “ No , no , ” said Tom ; “ there ’s somebody else in the wind . A tall man -- a confoundedly tall man -- with black whiskers . ” ‘
87936	87964	87924	87926	the old gentleman	10238	‘ “ Wo n’t she ? ” said Tom . “ If you stood in the bar , old gentleman , you ’d tell another story . ” ‘
87984	87993	87972	87974	the old gentleman	10238	‘ “ About what ? ” said Tom . ‘
88063	88115	88018	88018	he	10238	‘ “ I know all about that , Tom , ” said the old gentleman . “ I have seen it done very often in my time , Tom , between more people than I should like to mention to you ; but it never came to anything after all . ” ‘
88134	88177	88127	88127	Tom	248	‘ “ You may say that , Tom , ” replied the old fellow , with a very complicated wink . “ I am the last of my family , Tom , ” said the old gentleman , with a melancholy sigh . ‘
88190	88259	88187	88188	Tom Smart	248	‘ “ There were twelve of us , Tom , ” said the old gentleman ; “ fine , straight - backed , handsome fellows as you ’d wish to see . None of your modern abortions -- all with arms , and with a degree of polish , though I say it that should not , which it would have done your heart good to behold . ” ‘
88275	88331	88273	88274	Tom Smart--	394	‘ The old gentleman applied his elbow to his eye as he replied , “ Gone , Tom , gone . We had hard service , Tom , and they had n’t all my constitution . They got rheumatic about the legs and arms , and went into kitchens and other hospitals ; and one of ‘
88365	88374	88375	88377	The old fellow	3038	‘ “ Dreadful ! ” said Tom Smart . ‘
88395	88468	88375	88377	The old fellow	3038	‘ “ However , Tom , I am wandering from the point . This tall man , Tom , is a rascally adventurer . The moment he married the widow , he would sell off all the furniture , and run away . What would be the consequence ? She would be deserted and reduced to ruin , and I should catch my death of cold in some broker ’s shop . ” ‘
88474	88535	88375	88377	The old fellow	3038	‘ “ Do n’t interrupt me , ” said the old gentleman . “ Of you , Tom , I entertain a very different opinion ; for I well know that if you once settled yourself in a public - house , you would never leave it , as long as there was anything to drink within its walls . ” ‘
88556	88583	88553	88554	Tom Smart	248	‘ “ Therefore , ” resumed the old gentleman , in a dictatorial tone , “ you shall have her , and he shall not . ” ‘
88597	88615	88593	88594	Tom Smart	248	‘ “ This disclosure , ” replied the old gentleman ; “ he is already married . ” ‘
88633	88663	88625	88625	Tom	248	‘ The old gentleman untucked his arm from his side , and having pointed to one of the oaken presses , immediately replaced it , in its old position . ‘
88726	88808	88713	88713	Tom	248	‘ As the old gentleman solemnly uttered these words , his features grew less and less distinct , and his figure more shadowy . A film came over Tom Smart ’s eyes . The old man seemed gradually blending into the chair , the damask waistcoat to resolve into a cushion , the red slippers to shrink into little red cloth bags . The light faded gently away , and Tom Smart fell back on his pillow , and dropped asleep . ‘
88902	88926	88973	88973	Tom	248	‘ “ How are you , old boy ? ” said Tom . He was bolder in the daylight -- most men are . ‘
88938	88958	88973	88973	Tom	248	‘ “ Miserable morning , ” said Tom . No . The chair would not be drawn into conversation . ‘
88986	89063	88979	88979	gentlemen	10163	‘ “ It ’s not much trouble to open it , anyhow , ” said Tom , getting out of bed very deliberately . He walked up to one of the presses . The key was in the lock ; he turned it , and opened the door . There was a pair of trousers there . He put his hand into the pocket , and drew forth the identical letter the old gentleman had described ! ‘
89151	89276	89123	89123	he	248	‘ Tom surveyed the rooms he passed through , on his way downstairs , with the scrutinising eye of a landlord ; thinking it not impossible , that before long , they and their contents would be his property . The tall man was standing in the snug little bar , with his hands behind him , quite at home . He grinned vacantly at Tom . A casual observer might have supposed he did it , only to show his white teeth ; but Tom Smart thought that a consciousness of triumph was passing through the place where the tall man ’s mind would have been , if he had had any . Tom laughed in his face ; and summoned the landlady . ‘
89300	89324	89325	89325	Tom	248	‘ “ Good - morning , Sir , ” said the widow . “ What will you take for breakfast , sir ? ” ‘
89341	89366	89367	89367	em	3081	‘ “ There ’s a very nice ham , ” said the widow , “ and a beautiful cold larded fowl . Shall I send ‘
89373	89398	89367	89367	em	3081	‘ These words roused Tom from his reflections . His admiration of the widow increased as she spoke . Thoughtful creature ! Comfortable provider ! ‘
89414	89431	89412	89412	Tom	248	‘ “ His name is Jinkins , Sir , ” said the widow , slightly blushing . ‘
89443	89467	89441	89441	Tom	248	‘ “ He is a very fine man , Sir , ” replied the widow , “ and a very nice gentleman . ” ‘
89475	89498	89473	89473	Tom	248	‘ “ Is there anything more you want , Sir ? ” inquired the widow , rather puzzled by Tom ’s manner . ‘
89526	89605	89607	89607	My	0	‘ The widow looked much amazed , but she sat down , and Tom sat down too , close beside her . I do n’t know how it happened , gentlemen -- indeed my uncle used to tell me that Tom Smart said he did n’t know how it happened either -- but somehow or other the palm of Tom ’s hand fell upon the back of the widow ’s hand , and remained there while he spoke . ‘
89641	89698	89711	89712	Tom Smart	248	‘ “ Lor , Sir ! ” said the widow -- as well she might ; Tom ’s mode of commencing the conversation being rather unusual , not to say startling ; the fact of his never having set eyes upon her before the previous night being taken into consideration . “ Lor , Sir ! ” ‘
89756	89806	89741	89741	his	248	‘ The widow looked more puzzled than ever , and made an effort to rise . Tom gently pressed her hand , as if to detain her , and she kept her seat . Widows , gentlemen , are not usually timorous , as my uncle used to say . ‘
89843	89907	89909	89909	Jinkins	395	’ ” _ If _ , ” said Tom Smart , looking very shrewdly out of the right - hand corner of his left eye . “ _ If_-- ” “ Well , ” said the widow , laughing outright this time , “ _ when _ I do , I hope I shall have as good a husband as you describe . ” ‘
89918	89929	89916	89916	Tom	248	‘ “ Lor , sir ! ” exclaimed the widow . ‘
89948	89981	89940	89940	Tom	248	‘ “ I am sure nobody who knows him , knows anything bad of him , ” said the widow , bridling up at the mysterious air with which Tom had spoken . ‘
89990	90076	89987	89988	Tom Smart	248	‘ The widow began to think it was high time to cry , so she took out her handkerchief , and inquired whether Tom wished to insult her , whether he thought it like a gentleman to take away the character of another gentleman behind his back , why , if he had got anything to say , he did n’t say it to the man , like a man , instead of terrifying a poor weak woman in that way ; and so forth . ‘
90102	90120	90089	90089	Tom	248	‘ “ What is it ? ” inquired the widow , looking intently in Tom ’s countenance . ‘
90138	90168	90129	90129	Tom	248	‘ “ If it is , that he wants money , ” said the widow , “ I know that already , and you need n’t trouble yourself . ” ‘
90188	90193	90180	90181	Tom Smart	248	‘ Tain’t that . ” ‘
90210	90244	90206	90208	the poor widow	3101	‘ “ Do n’t be frightened , ” said Tom Smart . He slowly drew forth the letter , and unfolded it . “ You wo n’t scream ? ” said Tom doubtfully . ‘
90262	90281	90252	90253	the widow	1079	‘ “ You wo n’t go fainting away , or any of that nonsense ? ” said Tom . ‘
90293	90328	90289	90290	the widow	1079	‘ “ And do n’t run out , and blow him up , ” said Tom ; “ because I ’ll do all that for you . You had better not exert yourself . ” ‘
90346	90372	90336	90337	the widow	1079	‘ “ I will , ” replied Tom Smart ; and , with these words , he placed the letter in the widow ’s hand . ‘
90434	90451	90421	90422	The widow	1079	‘ “ Oh , the deception and villainy of the man ! ” said the widow . ‘
90468	90497	90465	90466	Tom Smart	248	‘ “ Oh , I ca n’t compose myself , ” shrieked the widow . “ I shall never find anyone else I can love so much ! ” ‘
90594	90646	90583	90583	Tom	248	‘ I never could find out , gentlemen , whether Tom did or did not kiss the widow at that particular moment . He used to tell my uncle he did n’t , but I have my doubts about it . Between ourselves , gentlemen , I rather think he did . ‘

90851	90894	90798	90798	He	248	‘ em said Tom invented it altogether ; and others said he was drunk and fancied it , and got hold of the wrong trousers by mistake before he went to bed . But nobody ever minded what _ they _ said . ’
90895	90904	90849	90852	Some of ‘ em	11758	‘ Tom Smart said it was all true ? ’
90905	90909	90849	90852	Some of ‘ em	11758	‘ Every word . ’

IN WHICH IS GIVEN A FAITHFUL PORTRAITURE OF TWO DISTINGUISHED PERSONS ; AND AN ACCURATE DESCRIPTION OF A PUBLIC BREAKFAST IN THEIR HOUSE AND GROUNDS : WHICH PUBLIC BREAKFAST LEADS TO THE RECOGNITION OF AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE , AND THE COMMENCEMENT OF ANOTHER CHAPTER Mr. Pickwick ’s conscience had been somewhat reproaching him for his recent neglect of his friends at the Peacock ; and he was just on the point of walking forth in quest of them , on the third morning after the election had terminated , when his faithful valet put into his hand a card , on which was engraved the following inscription:-- Mrs. Leo Hunter THE DEN . EATANSWILL . ‘

91309	91324	91294	91294	Sir	9716	’ said Mr. Pickwick . The stranger shook the extended hand , and then continued-- ‘

Mr. Pickwick returned the glare , concentrated into a focus by means of his spectacles , and breathed a bold defiance . Mr. Snodgrass and Mr. Winkle looked on , petrified at beholding such a scene between two such men . ‘

93007	93048	93005	93005	Sir	9716	’ replied Mr. Pickwick . Stimulated by the exciting nature of the dialogue , the heroic man actually threw himself into a paralytic attitude , confidently supposed by the two bystanders to have been intended as a posture of defence . ‘
93051	93131	92994	92994	I	0	’ exclaimed Mr. Snodgrass , suddenly recovering the power of speech , of which intense astonishment had previously bereft him , and rushing between the two , at the imminent hazard of receiving an application on the temple from each--‘what ! Mr. Pickwick , with the eyes of the world upon you ! Mr. Tupman ! who , in common with us all , derives a lustre from his undying name ! For shame , gentlemen ; for shame . ’
93190	93196	93198	93199	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I have been hasty , ’
93201	93210	93198	93199	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ very hasty . Tupman ; your hand . ’
93231	93239	93241	93241	he	244	‘ I have been hasty , too , ’
93243	93248	93250	93251	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ No , no , ’
93253	93267	93250	93251	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ the fault was mine . You will wear the green velvet jacket ? ’
93268	93273	93275	93276	Mr. Tupman	244	‘ No , no , ’
93278	93286	93288	93289	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ To oblige me , you will , ’
93291	93299	93301	93302	Mr. Tupman	244	‘ Well , well , I will , ’
93643	93764	93774	93777	the _ Independent _	2730	‘ would present a scene of varied and delicious enchantment -- a bewildering coruscation of beauty and talent -- a lavish and prodigal display of hospitality -- above all , a degree of splendour softened by the most exquisite taste ; and adornment refined with perfect harmony and the chastest good keeping -- compared with which , the fabled gorgeousness of Eastern fairyland itself would appear to be clothed in as many dark and murky colours , as must be the mind of the splenetic and unmanly being who could presume to taint with the venom of his envy , the preparations made by the virtuous and highly distinguished lady at whose shrine this humble tribute of admiration was offered . ’
94127	94130	94132	94133	Mr. Tupman	244	‘ Bravo ! ’
94148	94151	94132	94133	Mr. Tupman	244	‘ Bravo ! ’
94163	94169	94171	94172	the populace	3203	‘ Hoo - roar Pott ! ’
94514	94516	94510	94512	the young lady	2945	‘ did ’
94542	94544	94510	94512	the young lady	2945	‘ did ’
94621	94742	94743	94744	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ em , walking about , like ordinary men , smiling , and talking -- aye , and talking pretty considerable nonsense too , no doubt with the benign intention of rendering themselves intelligible to the common people about them . Moreover , there was a band of music in pasteboard caps ; four something - ean singers in the costume of their country , and a dozen hired waiters in the costume of _ their _ country -- and very dirty costume too . And above all , there was Mrs. Leo Hunter in the character of Minerva , receiving the company , and overflowing with pride and gratification at the notion of having called such distinguished individuals together . ‘
94748	94777	94743	94744	Mr. Pickwick	240	’ said a servant , as that gentleman approached the presiding goddess , with his hat in his hand , and the brigand and troubadour on either arm . ‘
94782	94798	94743	94744	Mr. Pickwick	240	’ exclaimed Mrs. Leo Hunter , starting up , in an affected rapture of surprise . ‘
94801	94806	94743	94744	Mr. Pickwick	240	’ said Mr. Pickwick . ‘
94822	94828	94820	94820	himself	240	’ ejaculated Mrs. Leo Hunter . ‘
94834	94843	94832	94832	ma’am	10369	’ replied Mr. Pickwick , bowing very low . ‘
94870	94984	94985	94986	Mr. Pickwick	240	’ Very few people but those who have tried it , know what a difficult process it is to bow in green velvet smalls , and a tight jacket , and high - crowned hat ; or in blue satin trunks and white silks , or knee - cords and top - boots that were never made for the wearer , and have been fixed upon him without the remotest reference to the comparative dimensions of himself and the suit . Never were such distortions as Mr. Tupman ’s frame underwent in his efforts to appear easy and graceful -- never was such ingenious posturing , as his fancy - dressed friends exhibited . ‘
94988	94994	94985	94986	Mr. Pickwick	240	’ said Mrs. Leo Hunter , ‘
95025	95026	95018	95018	I	0	’ ‘
95034	95039	95027	95027	You	240	’ said Mr. Pickwick . ‘
95057	95119	95051	95051	I	0	’ said Minerva , carelessly pointing towards a couple of full - grown young ladies , of whom one might be about twenty , and the other a year or two older , and who were dressed in very juvenile costumes -- whether to make them look young , or their mamma younger , Mr. Pickwick does not distinctly inform us . ‘
95125	95140	95120	95120	They	3249	’ said Mr. Pickwick , as the juveniles turned away , after being presented . ‘
95150	95157	95148	95148	Sir	9716	’ said Mr. Pott , majestically . ‘
95164	95187	95160	95162	you naughty man	10223	’ exclaimed Mrs. Leo Hunter , playfully tapping the editor ’s arm with her fan ( Minerva with a fan ! ) . ‘
95196	95210	95211	95211	you	397	’ said Mr. Pott , who was trumpeter in ordinary at the Den , ‘
95259	95260	95265	95265	they	3257	’ ‘
95277	95297	95298	95298	Count	3259	’ said Mrs. Leo Hunter , bestowing another tap on the slumbering lion of the Eatanswill _ Gazette _ . ‘
95302	95323	95300	95300	count	3259	’ screamed Mrs. Leo Hunter to a well - whiskered individual in a foreign uniform , who was passing by . ‘
95330	95338	95300	95300	count	3259	’ said the count , turning back . ‘
95351	95357	95358	95359	Mr. Pickwick	240	’ said Mrs. Leo Hunter . ‘
95372	95399	95400	95401	Mr. Pickwick	240	’ She added in a hurried whisper to Mr. Pickwick--‘The famous foreigner -- gathering materials for his great work on England-- hem!--Count Smorltork , Mr. Pickwick . ’
95426	95434	95436	95437	the count	11847	‘ What you say , Mrs. Hunt ? ’
95448	95509	95444	95446	Mrs. Leo Hunter	397	‘ Pig Vig or Big Vig -- what you call -- lawyer-- eh ? I see -- that is it . Big Vig’--and the count was proceeding to enter Mr. Pickwick in his tablets , as a gentleman of the long robe , who derived his name from the profession to which he belonged , when Mrs. Leo Hunter interposed . ‘
95516	95521	95522	95524	Pick - wick	411	’ said the lady , ‘
95526	95527	95522	95524	Pick - wick	411	’ ‘
95535	95540	95532	95532	I	0	’ replied the count . ‘
95563	95564	95561	95561	Weeks	249	’ ‘
95572	95583	95568	95568	I	0	’ replied Mr. Pickwick , with all his usual affability . ‘
95591	95592	95585	95585	you	397	’ ‘
95603	95604	95585	95585	you	397	’ ‘
95611	95612	95606	95606	you	397	’ ‘
95616	95617	95606	95606	you	397	’ ‘
95625	95631	95606	95606	you	397	’ said Mr. Pickwick smiling , ‘
95643	95644	95606	95606	you	397	’ ‘
95651	95656	95647	95647	they	3269	’ said the count . ‘
95659	95664	95665	95665	They	3269	’ said Mr. Pickwick . ‘
95669	95679	95665	95665	They	3269	’ added the count , tapping his forehead significantly . ‘
95702	95703	95708	95708	sir	9716	’ ‘
95710	95715	95708	95708	sir	9716	’ said Mr. Pickwick , ‘
95728	95729	95766	95766	himself--	3272	’ ‘
95732	95743	95766	95766	himself--	3272	’ said the count , drawing out the tablets again , ‘
95767	95804	95805	95805	Count	407	’ And down went Mr. Pickwick ’s remark , in Count Smorltork ’s tablets , with such variations and additions as the count ’s exuberant fancy suggested , or his imperfect knowledge of the language occasioned . ‘
95807	95813	95814	95815	Mrs. Hunt	408	’ said Mrs. Leo Hunter . ‘
95817	95822	95814	95815	Mrs. Hunt	408	’ replied the count . ‘
95839	95840	95814	95815	Mrs. Hunt	408	’ ‘
95843	95855	95814	95815	Mrs. Hunt	408	’ exclaimed the count , bringing out the tablets once more . ‘
95909	95945	95946	95947	Wonderful man	3278	’ And the count put up his tablets , and with sundry bows and acknowledgments walked away , thoroughly satisfied that he had made the most important and valuable additions to his stock of information . ‘
95952	95958	95959	95960	Sound philosopher	3279	’ said Mrs. Leo Hunter . ‘
95962	95967	95959	95960	Sound philosopher	3279	’ said Mr. Pott . ‘
95977	96005	95968	95975	Clear - headed , strong - minded person	3280	’ added Mr. Snodgrass . A chorus of bystanders took up the shout of Count Smorltork ’s praise , shook their heads sagely , and unanimously cried , ‘
96008	96274	95968	95975	Clear - headed , strong - minded person	3280	’ As the enthusiasm in Count Smorltork ’s favour ran very high , his praises might have been sung until the end of the festivities , if the four something - ean singers had not ranged themselves in front of a small apple - tree , to look picturesque , and commenced singing their national songs , which appeared by no means difficult of execution , inasmuch as the grand secret seemed to be , that three of the something - ean singers should grunt , while the fourth howled . This interesting performance having concluded amidst the loud plaudits of the whole company , a boy forthwith proceeded to entangle himself with the rails of a chair , and to jump over it , and crawl under it , and fall down with it , and do everything but sit upon it , and then to make a cravat of his legs , and tie them round his neck , and then to illustrate the ease with which a human being can be made to look like a magnified toad -- all which feats yielded high delight and satisfaction to the assembled spectators . After which , the voice of Mrs. Pott was heard to chirp faintly forth , something which courtesy interpreted into a song , which was all very classical , and strictly in character , because Apollo was himself a composer , and composers can very seldom sing their own music or anybody else ’s , either . This was succeeded by Mrs. Leo Hunter ’s recitation of her far - famed ‘
96281	96430	96277	96279	an Expiring Frog	3281	’ which was encored once , and would have been encored twice , if the major part of the guests , who thought it was high time to get something to eat , had not said that it was perfectly shameful to take advantage of Mrs. Hunter ’s good nature . So although Mrs. Leo Hunter professed her perfect willingness to recite the ode again , her kind and considerate friends would n’t hear of it on any account ; and the refreshment room being thrown open , all the people who had ever been there before , scrambled in with all possible despatch- -Mrs . Leo Hunter ’s usual course of proceedings being , to issue cards for a hundred , and breakfast for fifty , or in other words to feed only the very particular lions , and let the smaller animals take care of themselves . ‘
96436	96451	96433	96434	Mr. Pott	382	’ said Mrs. Leo Hunter , as she placed the aforesaid lions around her . ‘
96456	96486	96433	96434	Mr. Pott	382	’ said the editor , from the remotest end of the room ; far beyond all hope of food , unless something was done for him by the hostess . ‘
96494	96495	96489	96489	you	382	’ ‘
96504	96514	96502	96502	him	382	’ said Mrs. Pott , in the most obliging voice-- ‘
96541	96542	96537	96537	you	382	’ ‘
96547	96723	96724	96725	My dear	10214	’ replied the unhappy Pott , with a grim smile . Alas for the knout ! The nervous arm that wielded it , with such a gigantic force on public characters , was paralysed beneath the glance of the imperious Mrs. Pott . Mrs. Leo Hunter looked round her in triumph . Count Smorltork was busily engaged in taking notes of the contents of the dishes ; Mr. Tupman was doing the honours of the lobster salad to several lionesses , with a degree of grace which no brigand ever exhibited before ; Mr. Snodgrass having cut out the young gentleman who cut up the books for the Eatanswill _ Gazette _ , was engaged in an impassioned argument with the young lady who did the poetry ; and Mr. Pickwick was making himself universally agreeable . Nothing seemed wanting to render the select circle complete , when Mr. Leo Hunter -- whose department on these occasions , was to stand about in doorways , and talk to the less important people -- suddenly called out-- ‘
96735	96736	96729	96733	Mr. Charles Fitz - Marshall	413	’ ‘
96740	96746	96729	96733	Mr. Charles Fitz - Marshall	413	’ said Mrs. Leo Hunter , ‘
96790	96791	96768	96770	Mr. Fitz- Marshall	414	’ ‘
96798	96803	96796	96796	ma’am	10369	’ cried a voice , ‘
96822	96868	96768	96770	Mr. Fitz- Marshall	414	’ Mr. Pickwick ’s knife and fork fell from his hand . He stared across the table at Mr. Tupman , who had dropped his knife and fork , and was looking as if he were about to sink into the ground without further notice . ‘
96871	96908	96768	96770	Mr. Fitz- Marshall	414	’ cried the voice , as its owner pushed his way among the last five- and - twenty Turks , officers , cavaliers , and Charles the Seconds , that remained between him and the table , ‘
96971	97034	97035	97035	Hollo	303	’ With these broken words , a young man dressed as a naval officer made his way up to the table , and presented to the astonished Pickwickians the identical form and features of Mr. Alfred Jingle . The offender had barely time to take Mrs. Leo Hunter ’s proffered hand , when his eyes encountered the indignant orbs of Mr. Pickwick . ‘
97037	97041	97035	97035	Hollo	303	’ said Jingle . ‘
97051	97061	97035	97035	Hollo	303	‘ em at once -- back in a minute . ’
97062	97081	97083	97085	Mrs. Leo Hunter	397	‘ The servant , or Mr. Hunter will do it in a moment , Mr. Fitz - Marshall , ’
97087	97105	97107	97107	Jingle	256	‘ No , no -- I’ll do it -- shan’t be long -- back in no time , ’
97118	97129	97131	97134	the excited Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Will you allow me to ask you , ma’am , ’
97141	97153	97131	97134	the excited Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ who that young man is , and where he resides ? ’
97154	97165	97167	97169	Mrs. Leo Hunter	397	‘ He is a gentleman of fortune , Mr. Pickwick , ’
97171	97190	97167	97169	Mrs. Leo Hunter	397	‘ to whom I very much want to introduce you . The count will be delighted with him . ’
97191	97196	97198	97199	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Yes , yes , ’
97202	97205	97198	97199	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ His residence-- ’
97206	97216	97131	97134	the excited Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Is at present at the Angel at Bury . ’
97217	97221	97198	97199	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ At Bury ? ’
97222	97261	97198	97199	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ At Bury St. Edmunds , not many miles from here . But dear me , Mr. Pickwick , you are not going to leave us ; surely Mr. Pickwick you can not think of going so soon ? ’
97302	97309	97311	97312	Mr. Tupman	244	‘ It ’s of no use , ’
97314	97319	97311	97312	Mr. Tupman	244	‘ He has gone . ’
97320	97325	97327	97328	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I know it , ’
97330	97337	97327	97328	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ and I will follow him . ’
97338	97344	97346	97347	Mr. Tupman	244	‘ Follow him ! Where ? ’
97349	97356	97358	97359	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ To the Angel at Bury , ’
97365	97415	97358	97359	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ How do we know whom he is deceiving there ? He deceived a worthy man once , and we were the innocent cause . He shall not do it again , if I can help it ; I ’ll expose him ! Sam ! Where ’s my servant ? ’
97416	97423	97425	97426	Mr. Weller	356	‘ Here you are , Sir , ’
97461	97471	97435	97435	he	356	‘ Here ’s your servant , Sir . Proud o ’
97486	97487	97482	97482	they	3292	’ ‘
97492	97497	97498	97498	Tupman	244	’ said Mr. Pickwick . ‘
97523	98015	97498	97498	Tupman	244	’ Remonstrances were useless . Mr. Pickwick was roused , and his mind was made up . Mr. Tupman returned to his companions ; and in another hour had drowned all present recollection of Mr. Alfred Jingle , or Mr. Charles Fitz - Marshall , in an exhilarating quadrille and a bottle of champagne . By that time , Mr. Pickwick and Sam Weller , perched on the outside of a stage - coach , were every succeeding minute placing a less and less distance between themselves and the good old town of Bury St. Edmunds . CHAPTER XVI . TOO FULL OF ADVENTURE TO BE BRIEFLY DESCRIBED There is no month in the whole year in which nature wears a more beautiful appearance than in the month of August . Spring has many beauties , and May is a fresh and blooming month , but the charms of this time of year are enhanced by their contrast with the winter season . August has no such advantage . It comes when we remember nothing but clear skies , green fields , and sweet - smelling flowers -- when the recollection of snow , and ice , and bleak winds , has faded from our minds as completely as they have disappeared from the earth -- and yet what a pleasant time it is ! Orchards and cornfields ring with the hum of labour ; trees bend beneath the thick clusters of rich fruit which bow their branches to the ground ; and the corn , piled in graceful sheaves , or waving in every light breath that sweeps above it , as if it wooed the sickle , tinges the landscape with a golden hue . A mellow softness appears to hang over the whole earth ; the influence of the season seems to extend itself to the very wagon , whose slow motion across the well- reaped field is perceptible only to the eye , but strikes with no harsh sound upon the ear . As the coach rolls swiftly past the fields and orchards which skirt the road , groups of women and children , piling the fruit in sieves , or gathering the scattered ears of corn , pause for an instant from their labour , and shading the sun - burned face with a still browner hand , gaze upon the passengers with curious eyes , while some stout urchin , too small to work , but too mischievous to be left at home , scrambles over the side of the basket in which he has been deposited for security , and kicks and screams with delight . The reaper stops in his work , and stands with folded arms , looking at the vehicle as it whirls past ; and the rough cart - horses bestow a sleepy glance upon the smart coach team , which says as plainly as a horse ’s glance can , ‘
98050	98214	98218	98218	Sam	240	’ You cast a look behind you , as you turn a corner of the road . The women and children have resumed their labour ; the reaper once more stoops to his work ; the cart - horses have moved on ; and all are again in motion . The influence of a scene like this , was not lost upon the well - regulated mind of Mr. Pickwick . Intent upon the resolution he had formed , of exposing the real character of the nefarious Jingle , in any quarter in which he might be pursuing his fraudulent designs , he sat at first taciturn and contemplative , brooding over the means by which his purpose could be best attained . By degrees his attention grew more and more attracted by the objects around him ; and at last he derived as much enjoyment from the ride , as if it had been undertaken for the pleasantest reason in the world . ‘
98220	98225	98218	98218	Sam	240	’ said Mr. Pickwick . ‘
98234	98243	98232	98232	Sir	9716	’ replied Mr. Weller , touching his hat . ‘
98265	98272	98263	98263	Sam	356	’ said Mr. Pickwick , smiling . ‘
98281	98293	98279	98279	sir	9716	’ said Mr. Weller , with a shake of the head . ‘
98303	98304	98294	98294	I	0	’ ‘
98309	98314	98294	98294	I	0	’ inquired Mr. Pickwick . ‘

98424	98429	98422	98422	Sam	240	’ said Mr. Pickwick . ‘
98441	98446	98436	98436	I	0	’ replied Mr. Weller . ‘
98499	98523	98491	98491	she	3308	‘ sterics ; and he smokes wery comfortably till she comes to agin . That ’s philosophy , Sir , ai n’t it ? ’
98524	98536	98538	98539	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ A very good substitute for it , at all events , ’
98543	98564	98538	98539	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ It must have been of great service to you , in the course of your rambling life , Sam . ’
98565	98570	98572	98572	Sam	240	‘ Service , sir , ’
98574	98606	98572	98572	Sam	240	‘ You may say that . Arter I run away from the carrier , and afore I took up with the vaginer , I had unfurnished lodgin ’s for a fortnight . ’
98607	98611	98613	98614	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Unfurnished lodgings ? ’
98616	98634	98613	98614	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Yes -- the dry arches of Waterloo Bridge . Fine sleeping - place -- vithin ten minutes ’

99074	99119	99065	99067	Bury St. Edmunds	415	’ replied Mr. Pickwick . The coach rattled through the well - paved streets of a handsome little town , of thriving and cleanly appearance , and stopped before a large inn situated in a wide open street , nearly facing the old abbey . ‘

102457	102462	102452	102452	yourself	9716	’ said Mr. Pickwick ; ‘
102491	102515	102516	102516	I	0	’ Job Trotter bowed low ; and in spite of Mr. Weller ’s previous remonstrance , the tears again rose to his eyes . ‘
102523	102527	102519	102521	such a feller	3405	’ said Sam , ‘
102548	102549	102550	102550	Sam	356	’ ‘
102552	102561	102563	102563	your	356	’ said Mr. Pickwick , with great severity , ‘

102621	102626	102619	102619	sir	9716	’ responded Job Trotter . ‘
102632	102639	102619	102619	sir	9716	’ said Mr. Weller , aside . ‘
102644	102649	102619	102619	sir	9716	’ resumed Mr. Pickwick . ‘
102658	102659	102619	102619	sir	9716	’ ‘
102678	102688	102690	102691	Mr. Pickwick	240	’ My servant will give me a leg up , ’
102694	102709	102690	102691	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ You will be sure to be near this door that you speak of ? ’
102710	102747	102619	102619	sir	9716	‘ You can not mistake it , Sir ; it ’s the only one that opens into the garden . Tap at it when you hear the clock strike , and I will open it instantly . ’
102748	102756	102758	102759	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I do n’t like the plan , ’
102761	102796	102758	102759	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ but as I see no other , and as the happiness of this young lady ’s whole life is at stake , I adopt it . I shall be sure to be there . ’
102827	102836	102838	102839	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ What is the name of the house ? ’
102841	102888	102838	102839	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Westgate House , Sir . You turn a little to the right when you get to the end of the town ; it stands by itself , some little distance off the high road , with the name on a brass plate on the gate . ’
102889	102894	102896	102897	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I know it , ’
102899	102919	102896	102897	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I observed it once before , when I was in this town . You may depend upon me . ’

103058	103064	103055	103055	Job	419	‘ Good- morning , sir . ’
103065	103067	103001	103001	I	0	‘ You ’re

103382	103388	103379	103380	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Wery well , Sir . ’
103389	103400	103440	103441	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ And you will sit up , till I return . ’
103401	103406	103379	103380	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Cert’nly , Sir . ’
103407	103427	103379	103380	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Take hold of my leg ; and , when I say “ Over , ” raise me gently . ’
103428	103434	103440	103441	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ All right , sir . ’
103453	103456	103440	103441	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Over , ’
103539	103550	103552	103552	Sam	240	‘ You ha’n’t hurt yourself , I hope , Sir ? ’

103603	103616	103592	103593	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ but I rather think that _ you _ have hurt me . ’
103617	103624	103626	103626	Sam	240	‘ I hope not , Sir , ’
103628	103632	103634	103635	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Never mind , ’
103639	103657	103634	103635	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ it ’s nothing but a few scratches . Go away , or we shall be overheard . ’
103658	103665	103592	103593	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Good - bye , Sir . ’
103666	103671	103592	103593	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Good - bye . ’
103846	103852	103854	103855	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ That ’s the time , ’
104075	104085	104087	104088	the girl	9813	‘ It must have been the cat , Sarah , ’
104099	104110	104091	104091	herself	9813	‘ Puss , puss , puss,--tit , tit , tit . ’
104143	104149	104151	104152	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ This is very curious , ’
104154	104188	104151	104152	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ They are sitting up beyond their usual hour , I suppose . Extremely unfortunate , that they should have chosen this night , of all others , for such a purpose-- exceedingly . ’
104440	104446	104448	104449	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ What a dreadful situation , ’
104539	104544	104523	104523	He	240	‘ Who ’s there ? ’
104545	104551	104553	104554	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ That ’s not Job , ’
104566	104572	104553	104554	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ It ’s a woman . ’
104604	104757	104839	104851	the lady abbess , who took care to be on the top stair	3448	’ Mr. Pickwick dared not move hand or foot . It was clear that the whole establishment was roused . He made up his mind to remain where he was , until the alarm had subsided ; and then by a supernatural effort , to get over the wall , or perish in the attempt . Like all Mr. Pickwick ’s determinations , this was the best that could be made under the circumstances ; but , unfortunately , it was founded upon the assumption that they would not venture to open the door again . What was his discomfiture , when he heard the chain and bolts withdrawn , and saw the door slowly opening , wider and wider ! He retreated into the corner , step by step ; but do what he would , the interposition of his own person , prevented its being opened to its utmost width . ‘
104762	104833	104839	104851	the lady abbess , who took care to be on the top stair	3448	’ screamed a numerous chorus of treble voices from the staircase inside , consisting of the spinster lady of the establishment , three teachers , five female servants , and thirty boarders , all half- dressed and in a forest of curl - papers . Of course Mr. Pickwick did n’t say who was there : and then the burden of the chorus changed into--‘Lor ! I am so frightened . ’
104834	104837	104839	104851	the lady abbess , who took care to be on the top stair	3448	‘ Cook , ’
104872	104882	104884	104885	the cook	3453	’ Please , ma’am , I do n’t like , ’
104887	104898	104900	104902	the thirty boarders	3454	‘ Lor , what a stupid thing that cook is ! ’
104904	104907	104909	104911	the lady abbess	3455	‘ Cook , ’
104917	104937	104909	104911	the lady abbess	3455	‘ do n’t answer me , if you please . I insist upon your looking into the garden immediately . ’
104951	104955	104939	104940	the cook	3453	‘ a shame ! ’
104969	104976	104978	104980	the lady abbess	3455	‘ Do you hear , cook ? ’
104987	104997	104999	105001	the three teachers	3459	‘ Do n’t you hear your missis , cook ? ’
105003	105012	105014	105016	the thirty boarders	3454	‘ What an impudent thing that cook is ! ’
105108	105117	105119	105121	the lady abbess	3455	‘ What is the matter with Miss Smithers ? ’
105139	105147	105149	105156	the other nine - and - twenty boarders	3467	‘ Lor , Miss Smithers , dear , ’
105158	105171	105173	105174	Miss Smithers	426	‘ Oh , the man -- the man -- behind the door ! ’
105261	105267	105269	105270	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Ladies -- dear ladies , ’
105272	105278	105269	105270	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Oh . he says we ’re
105281	105289	105269	105270	Mr. Pickwick	240	’ cried the oldest and ugliest teacher . ‘
105295	105296	105297	105297	Ladies	1128	’ ‘
105299	105313	105315	105315	me	0	’ roared Mr. Pickwick , rendered desperate by the danger of his situation . ‘
105330	105331	105322	105322	I	0	’ ‘
105339	105344	105345	105345	He	3480	’ screamed another teacher . ‘
105350	105358	105347	105348	Miss Tomkins	427	’ Here there was a general scream . ‘
105366	105372	105364	105364	somebody	9931	’ cried a dozen voices . ‘
105377	105382	105364	105364	somebody	9931	’ shouted Mr. Pickwick . ‘
105431	105432	105429	105429	me	0	’ ‘
105441	105446	105435	105435	you	0	’ faltered the housemaid . ‘
105461	105474	105476	105476	her	3477	’ said Mr. Pickwick , exerting his lungs to the utmost pitch . ‘
105492	105649	105484	105484	her	3477	’ It might have been Mr. Pickwick ’s appearance , or it might have been his manner , or it might have been the temptation -- irresistible to a female mind -- of hearing something at present enveloped in mystery , that reduced the more reasonable portion of the establishment ( some four individuals ) to a state of comparative quiet . By them it was proposed , as a test of Mr. Pickwick ’s sincerity , that he should immediately submit to personal restraint ; and that gentleman having consented to hold a conference with Miss Tomkins , from the interior of a closet in which the day boarders hung their bonnets and sandwich - bags , he at once stepped into it , of his own accord , and was securely locked in . This revived the others ; and Miss Tomkins having been brought to , and brought down , the conference began . ‘
105660	105670	105652	105652	you	3489	’ said Miss Tomkins , in a faint voice . ‘
105689	105701	105677	105681	one of your young ladies	3492	’ replied Mr. Pickwick , from the interior of the closet . ‘
105704	105722	105677	105681	one of your young ladies	3492	’ exclaimed Miss Tomkins , the three teachers , the thirty boarders , and the five servants . ‘
105726	105736	105677	105681	one of your young ladies	3492	’ Your friend , Mr. Charles Fitz - Marshall . ’
105737	105751	105677	105681	one of your young ladies	3492	‘ _ My _ friend ! I do n’t know any such person . ’
105752	105760	105677	105681	one of your young ladies	3492	‘ Well , Mr. Jingle , then . ’
105761	105771	105677	105681	one of your young ladies	3492	‘ I never heard the name in my life . ’
105772	105783	105785	105786	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Then , I have been deceived , and deluded , ’
105788	105836	105785	105786	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I have been the victim of a conspiracy -- a foul and base conspiracy . Send to the Angel , my dear ma’am , if you do n’t believe me . Send to the Angel for Mr. Pickwick ’s manservant , I implore you , ma’am . ’
105837	105848	105850	105851	Miss Tomkins	427	‘ He must be respectable -- he keeps a manservant , ’
105859	105868	105870	105874	the writing and ciphering governess	3494	‘ It ’s my opinion , Miss Tomkins , ’
105876	105900	105870	105874	the writing and ciphering governess	3494	‘ that his manservant keeps him , I think he ’s a madman , Miss Tomkins , and the other ’s his keeper . ’
105901	105912	105914	105915	Miss Tomkins	427	‘ I think you are very right , Miss Gwynn , ’
105917	105939	105914	105915	Miss Tomkins	427	‘ Let two of the servants repair to the Angel , and let the others remain here , to protect us . ’
106132	106137	106139	106140	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ My dear friend , ’
106150	106206	106139	106140	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ my dear friend , pray , for Heaven ’s sake , explain to this lady the unfortunate and dreadful situation in which I am placed . You must have heard it from my servant ; say , at all events , my dear fellow , that I am neither a robber nor a madman . ’
106207	106223	106225	106226	Mr. Wardle	292	‘ I have said so , my dear friend . I have said so already , ’
106243	106255	106257	106258	Mr. Weller	356	‘ And whoever says , or has said , he is , ’
106263	106293	106257	106258	Mr. Weller	356	‘ says that which is not the truth , but so far from it , on the contrary , quite the rewerse . And if there ’s any number o ’
106311	106319	106257	106258	Mr. Weller	356	‘ em all a wery convincing proof o ’
106335	106345	106257	106258	Mr. Weller	356	‘ ll have the goodness to retire , and order ‘
106354	106492	106257	106258	Mr. Weller	356	’ Having delivered this defiance with great volubility , Mr. Weller struck his open palm emphatically with his clenched fist , and winked pleasantly on Miss Tomkins , the intensity of whose horror at his supposing it within the bounds of possibility that there could be any men on the premises of Westgate House Establishment for Young Ladies , it is impossible to describe . Mr. Pickwick ’s explanation having already been partially made , was soon concluded . But neither in the course of his walk home with his friends , nor afterwards when seated before a blazing fire at the supper he so much needed , could a single observation be drawn from him . He seemed bewildered and amazed . Once , and only once , he turned round to Mr. Wardle , and said-- ‘
106499	106500	106501	106501	Trundle	290	’ ‘
106516	106520	106503	106503	I	0	’ replied Wardle . ‘
106548	106587	106542	106542	I	0	’ said the old fellow , slapping him on the back--‘I am glad you are . We shall have a jovial party on the first , and we ’ll give Winkle another chance -- eh , old boy ? ’
106638	106641	106643	106644	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Sam , ’
106655	106658	106660	106661	Mr. Weller	356	‘ Sir , ’

106765	106785	106787	106788	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Jingle suspected my design , and set that fellow on you , with this story , I suppose ? ’
106793	106799	106801	106802	Mr. Weller	356	‘ Just that , sir , ’
106804	106813	106801	106802	Mr. Weller	356	‘ It was all false , of course ? ’

106824	106833	106821	106822	Mr. Weller	356	‘ Reg’lar do , sir ; artful dodge . ’
106834	106852	106854	106855	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I do n’t think he ’ll escape us quite so easily the next time , Sam ! ’
106857	106867	106854	106855	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I do n’t think he will , Sir . ’
106868	106880	106882	106883	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Whenever I meet that Jingle again , wherever it is , ’
106899	106928	106882	106883	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I ’ll inflict personal chastisement on him , in addition to the exposure he so richly merits . I will , or my name is not Pickwick . ’
106929	106936	106975	106975	Weller	356	‘ And venever I catches hold o ’
106948	106952	106939	106946	melan - cholly chap with the black hair	3521	’ said Sam , ‘
106983	107297	106981	106981	Sir	9716	’ CHAPTER XVII . SHOWING THAT AN ATTACK OF RHEUMATISM , IN SOME CASES , ACTS AS A QUICKENER TO INVENTIVE GENIUS The constitution of Mr. Pickwick , though able to sustain a very considerable amount of exertion and fatigue , was not proof against such a combination of attacks as he had undergone on the memorable night , recorded in the last chapter . The process of being washed in the night air , and rough - dried in a closet , is as dangerous as it is peculiar . Mr. Pickwick was laid up with an attack of rheumatism . But although the bodily powers of the great man were thus impaired , his mental energies retained their pristine vigour . His spirits were elastic ; his good - humour was restored . Even the vexation consequent upon his recent adventure had vanished from his mind ; and he could join in the hearty laughter , which any allusion to it excited in Mr. Wardle , without anger and without embarrassment . Nay , more . During the two days Mr. Pickwick was confined to bed , Sam was his constant attendant . On the first , he endeavoured to amuse his master by anecdote and conversation ; on the second , Mr. Pickwick demanded his writing - desk , and pen and ink , and was deeply engaged during the whole day . On the third , being able to sit up in his bedchamber , he despatched his valet with a message to Mr. Wardle and Mr. Trundle , intimating that if they would take their wine there , that evening , they would greatly oblige him . The invitation was most willingly accepted ; and when they were seated over their wine , Mr. Pickwick , with sundry blushes , produced the following little tale , as having been ‘
107299	107326	106981	106981	Sir	9716	’ by himself , during his recent indisposition , from his notes of Mr. Weller ’s unsophisticated recital . THE PARISH CLERK A TALE OF TRUE LOVE ‘
107380	107600	107348	107385	a little man named Nathaniel Pipkin , who was the parish clerk of the little town , and lived in a little house in the little High Street , within ten minutes ’ walk from the little church	12142	’ walk from the little church ; and who was to be found every day , from nine till four , teaching a little learning to the little boys . Nathaniel Pipkin was a harmless , inoffensive , good - natured being , with a turned - up nose , and rather turned - in legs , a cast in his eye , and a halt in his gait ; and he divided his time between the church and his school , verily believing that there existed not , on the face of the earth , so clever a man as the curate , so imposing an apartment as the vestry - room , or so well - ordered a seminary as his own . Once , and only once , in his life , Nathaniel Pipkin had seen a bishop -- a real bishop , with his arms in lawn sleeves , and his head in a wig . He had seen him walk , and heard him talk , at a confirmation , on which momentous occasion Nathaniel Pipkin was so overcome with reverence and awe , when the aforesaid bishop laid his hand on his head , that he fainted right clean away , and was borne out of church in the arms of the beadle . ‘
107865	108124	108148	108148	he	431	‘ It _ is _ matter of wonder , though , that anyone of Mr. Nathaniel Pipkin ’s retiring disposition , nervous temperament , and most particularly diminutive income , should from this day forth , have dared to aspire to the hand and heart of the only daughter of the fiery old Lobbs -- of old Lobbs , the great saddler , who could have bought up the whole village at one stroke of his pen , and never felt the outlay -- old Lobbs , who was well known to have heaps of money , invested in the bank at the nearest market town -- who was reported to have countless and inexhaustible treasures hoarded up in the little iron safe with the big keyhole , over the chimney - piece in the back parlour -- and who , it was well known , on festive occasions garnished his board with a real silver teapot , cream- ewer , and sugar - basin , which he was wo nt , in the pride of his heart , to boast should be his daughter ’s property when she found a man to her mind . I repeat it , to be matter of profound astonishment and intense wonder , that Nathaniel Pipkin should have had the temerity to cast his eyes in this direction . But love is blind ; and Nathaniel had a cast in his eye ; and perhaps these two circumstances , taken together , prevented his seeing the matter in its proper light . ‘
108259	108268	108228	108228	he	431	’ heads would stand on end with fright . ‘
108494	108683	108684	108685	Nathaniel Pipkin	431	‘ A prettier foot , a gayer heart , a more dimpled face , or a smarter form , never bounded so lightly over the earth they graced , as did those of Maria Lobbs , the old saddler ’s daughter . There was a roguish twinkle in her sparkling eyes , that would have made its way to far less susceptible bosoms than that of Nathaniel Pipkin ; and there was such a joyous sound in her merry laugh , that the sternest misanthrope must have smiled to hear it . Even old Lobbs himself , in the very height of his ferocity , could n’t resist the coaxing of his pretty daughter ; and when she , and her cousin Kate -- an arch , impudent - looking , bewitching little person-- made a dead set upon the old man together , as , to say the truth , they very often did , he could have refused them nothing , even had they asked for a portion of the countless and inexhaustible treasures , which were hidden from the light , in the iron safe . ‘
109388	109777	109798	109808	the person who made this loud knocking at the street door	3565	‘ There was a very snug little party , consisting of Maria Lobbs and her cousin Kate , and three or four romping , good - humoured , rosy - cheeked girls . Nathaniel Pipkin had ocular demonstration of the fact , that the rumours of old Lobbs ’s treasures were not exaggerated . There were the real solid silver teapot , cream - ewer , and sugar - basin , on the table , and real silver spoons to stir the tea with , and real china cups to drink it out of , and plates of the same , to hold the cakes and toast in . The only eye - sore in the whole place was another cousin of Maria Lobbs ’s , and a brother of Kate , whom Maria Lobbs called “ Henry , ” and who seemed to keep Maria Lobbs all to himself , up in one corner of the table . It ’s a delightful thing to see affection in families , but it may be carried rather too far , and Nathaniel Pipkin could not help thinking that Maria Lobbs must be very particularly fond of her relations , if she paid as much attention to all of them as to this individual cousin . After tea , too , when the wicked little cousin proposed a game at blind man ’s buff , it somehow or other happened that Nathaniel Pipkin was nearly always blind , and whenever he laid his hand upon the male cousin , he was sure to find that Maria Lobbs was not far off . And though the wicked little cousin and the other girls pinched him , and pulled his hair , and pushed chairs in his way , and all sorts of things , Maria Lobbs never seemed to come near him at all ; and once -- once -- Nathaniel Pipkin could have sworn he heard the sound of a kiss , followed by a faint remonstrance from Maria Lobbs , and a half - suppressed laugh from her female friends . All this was odd -- very odd -- and there is no saying what Nathaniel Pipkin might or might not have done , in consequence , if his thoughts had not been suddenly directed into a new channel . ‘
109935	110069	110070	110070	Nature	436	‘ Now it did unfortunately happen that old Lobbs being very hungry was monstrous cross . Nathaniel Pipkin could hear him growling away like an old mastiff with a sore throat ; and whenever the unfortunate apprentice with the thin legs came into the room , so surely did old Lobbs commence swearing at him in a most Saracenic and ferocious manner , though apparently with no other end or object than that of easing his bosom by the discharge of a few superfluous oaths . At length some supper , which had been warming up , was placed on the table , and then old Lobbs fell to , in regular style ; and having made clear work of it in no time , kissed his daughter , and demanded his pipe . ‘
110303	110325	110287	110287	he	437	‘ “ Why , what the devil do you want here ? ” said old Lobbs , in a fearful voice . ‘
110357	110382	110334	110335	old Lobbs	432	‘ “ What do you want here ? ” roared Lobbs ; “ I suppose you have come after my daughter , now ! ” ‘
110418	110443	110459	110460	old Lobbs	432	‘ “ Yes , I did , Mr. Lobbs , I did come after your daughter . I love her , Mr. Lobbs . ” ‘
110490	110551	110459	110460	old Lobbs	432	‘ It is by no means improbable that old Lobbs would have carried his threat into execution , in the excess of his rage , if his arm had not been stayed by a very unexpected apparition : to wit , the male cousin , who , stepping out of his closet , and walking up to old Lobbs , said-- ‘
110624	110642	110644	110644	You	3586	‘ Old Lobbs opened his eyes very wide at this , but not wider than Nathaniel Pipkin . ‘
110658	110664	110649	110649	Lobbs	432	‘ “ I did . ” ‘
110677	110697	110667	110667	I	0	‘ “ You did , or I should not have been here , clandestinely , to - night . ” ‘
110738	110785	110786	110788	The old man	1779	‘ “ Do n’t stop him , Maria , ” said the young man ; “ if he has the will to strike me , let him . I would not hurt a hair of his gray head , for the riches of the world . ” ‘
110962	111033	111034	111035	Nathaniel Pipkin	431	‘ Five minutes after this , the girls were brought down from the bedroom with a great deal of giggling and modesty ; and while the young people were making themselves perfectly happy , old Lobbs got down the pipe , and smoked it ; and it was a remarkable circumstance about that particular pipe of tobacco , that it was the most soothing and delightful one he ever smoked . ‘
111185	111521	111522	111522	Serpent	441	’ CHAPTER XVIII . BRIEFLY ILLUSTRATIVE OF TWO POINTS ; FIRST , THE POWER OF HYSTERICS , AND , SECONDLY , THE FORCE OF CIRCUMSTANCES For two days after the _ dejeune _ at Mrs. Hunter ’s , the Pickwickians remained at Eatanswill , anxiously awaiting the arrival of some intelligence from their revered leader . Mr. Tupman and Mr. Snodgrass were once again left to their own means of amusement ; for Mr. Winkle , in compliance with a most pressing invitation , continued to reside at Mr. Pott ’s house , and to devote his time to the companionship of his amiable lady . Nor was the occasional society of Mr. Pott himself wanting to complete their felicity . Deeply immersed in the intensity of his speculations for the public weal and the destruction of the _ Independent _ , it was not the habit of that great man to descend from his mental pinnacle to the humble level of ordinary minds . On this occasion , however , and as if expressly in compliment to any follower of Mr. Pickwick ’s , he unbent , relaxed , stepped down from his pedestal , and walked upon the ground , benignly adapting his remarks to the comprehension of the herd , and seeming in outward form , if not in spirit , to be one of them . Such having been the demeanour of this celebrated public character towards Mr. Winkle , it will be readily imagined that considerable surprise was depicted on the countenance of the latter gentleman , when , as he was sitting alone in the breakfast - room , the door was hastily thrown open , and as hastily closed , on the entrance of Mr. Pott , who , stalking majestically towards him , and thrusting aside his proffered hand , ground his teeth , as if to put a sharper edge on what he was about to utter , and exclaimed , in a saw - like voice-- ‘
111524	111525	111526	111526	Sir	9716	’ ‘
111528	111538	111539	111539	Serpent	441	’ exclaimed Mr. Winkle , starting from his chair . ‘
111543	111558	111559	111559	I	0	’ repeated Mr. Pott , raising his voice , and then suddenly depressing it : ‘
111572	111663	111559	111559	I	0	’ When you have parted with a man at two o’clock in the morning , on terms of the utmost good - fellowship , and he meets you again , at half - past nine , and greets you as a serpent , it is not unreasonable to conclude that something of an unpleasant nature has occurred meanwhile . So Mr. Winkle thought . He returned Mr. Pott ’s gaze of stone , and in compliance with that gentleman ’s request , proceeded to make the most he could of the ‘
111666	111686	111689	111689	he	9716	’ The most , however , was nothing at all ; so , after a profound silence of some minutes ’
111691	111710	111689	111689	he	9716	‘ Serpent , Sir ! Serpent , Mr. Pott ! What can you mean , Sir?--this is pleasantry . ’
111711	111716	111718	111718	Pott	382	‘ Pleasantry , sir ! ’
111745	111764	111768	111768	his	382	‘ Pleasantry , sir!--But -- no , I will be calm ; I will be calm , Sir ; ’
111785	111790	111792	111793	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ My dear sir , ’
111795	111801	111803	111803	Pott	382	‘ _ DEAR _ Sir ! ’
111805	111832	111803	111803	Pott	382	‘ How dare you address me , as dear Sir , Sir ? How dare you look me in the face and do it , sir ? ’
111833	111844	111846	111847	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ Well , Sir , if you come to that , ’
111849	111867	111846	111847	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ how dare you look me in the face , and call me a serpent , sir ? ’
111868	111874	111876	111877	Mr. Pott	382	‘ Because you are one , ’
111879	111885	111887	111888	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ Prove it , Sir , ’
111891	111895	111887	111888	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ Prove it . ’
111951	112140	111941	111942	That gentleman	9760	‘ Our obscure and filthy contemporary , in some disgusting observations on the recent election for this borough , has presumed to violate the hallowed sanctity of private life , and to refer in a manner not to be misunderstood , to the personal affairs of our late candidate -- aye , and notwithstanding his base defeat , we will add , our future member , Mr. Fizkin . What does our dastardly contemporary mean ? What would the ruffian say , if we , setting at naught , like him , the decencies of social intercourse , were to raise the curtain which happily conceals _ His _ private life from general ridicule , not to say from general execration ? What , if we were even to point out , and comment on , facts and circumstances , which are publicly notorious , and beheld by every one but our mole - eyed contemporary -- what if we were to print the following effusion , which we received while we were writing the commencement of this article , from a talented fellow - townsman and correspondent ? ‘
112147	112187	111941	111942	That gentleman	9760	‘ “ Oh Pott ! if you ’d known How false she ’d have grown , When you heard the marriage bells tinkle ; You ’d have done then , I vow , What you can not help now , ‘
112190	112203	111941	111942	That gentleman	9760	’ said Mr. Pott solemnly--‘what rhymes to “ tinkle , ” villain ? ’
112204	112210	112212	112213	Mrs. Pott	384	‘ What rhymes to tinkle ? ’
112224	112238	112212	112213	Mrs. Pott	384	‘ What rhymes to tinkle ? Why , Winkle , I should conceive . ’
112277	112284	112286	112287	the editor	11427	‘ Back , ma’am -- back ! ’
112289	112298	112286	112287	the editor	11427	‘ Take his hand before my very face ! ’
112299	112303	112305	112307	his astonished lady	3618	‘ Mr. P. ! ’
112309	112316	112318	112319	the husband	3619	‘ Wretched woman , look here , ’
112321	112363	112318	112319	the husband	3619	‘ Look here , ma’am-- “ Lines to a Brass Pot . ” “ Brass Pot ” ; that ’s me , ma’am . “ False _ she ’d _ have grown ” ; that ’s you , ma’am -- you . ’
112405	112412	112414	112417	the astonished Mrs. Pott	384	‘ Upon my word , Sir , ’
112426	112433	112414	112417	the astonished Mrs. Pott	384	‘ Upon my word , Sir ! ’
112475	112482	112434	112435	Mr. Pott	382	‘ Upon my word , sir , ’
112620	112624	112626	112628	the terrified Pott	382	‘ My dear , ’
112630	112638	112626	112628	the terrified Pott	382	‘ I did n’t say I believed it;--I-- ’
112654	112671	112673	112674	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ Mrs. Pott , let me entreat you , my dear ma’am , to compose yourself , ’
112690	112694	112696	112697	Mr. Pott	382	‘ My dear , ’
112699	112701	112696	112697	Mr. Pott	382	‘ I ’m
112729	112856	112723	112724	a crowd	2685	’ But the more strenuously Mr. Pott entreated , the more vehemently the screams poured forth . Very fortunately , however , attached to Mrs. Pott ’s person was a bodyguard of one , a young lady whose ostensible employment was to preside over her toilet , but who rendered herself useful in a variety of ways , and in none more so than in the particular department of constantly aiding and abetting her mistress in every wish and inclination opposed to the desires of the unhappy Pott . The screams reached this young lady ’s ears in due course , and brought her into the room with a speed which threatened to derange , materially , the very exquisite arrangement of her cap and ringlets . ‘
112865	112881	112723	112724	a crowd	2685	’ exclaimed the bodyguard , kneeling frantically by the side of the prostrate Mrs. Pott . ‘
112893	112894	112886	112886	mistress	3632	’ ‘
112902	112913	112886	112886	mistress	3632	’ murmured the patient . Pott was evidently giving way . ‘
112919	112925	112926	112926	I	0	’ said the bodyguard reproachfully . ‘
112942	112956	112936	112936	ma’am	10369	’ He gave way more . The opposite party followed up the attack . ‘
112970	112988	112989	112989	You	444	’ murmured Mrs. Pott , clutching at the wrist of the said Goodwin with an hysteric jerk . ‘
112990	113002	112936	112936	ma’am	10369	’re the only person that ’s kind to me , Goodwin . ’
113024	113031	113033	113033	Goodwin	444	‘ Never , ma’am -- never , ’
113035	113076	113033	113033	Goodwin	444	‘ Oh , sir , you should be careful-- you should indeed ; you do n’t know what harm you may do missis ; you ’ll be sorry for it one day , I know -- I’ve always said so . ’
113088	113091	113093	113094	Mrs. Pott	384	‘ Goodwin , ’
113101	113104	113106	113106	Goodwin	444	‘ Ma’am , ’
113108	113119	113106	113106	Goodwin	444	‘ If you only knew how I have loved that man-- ’
113130	113147	113128	113128	ma’am	10369	’ said the bodyguard . Pott looked very frightened . It was time to finish him . ‘
113151	113156	113106	113106	Goodwin	444	’ sobbed Mrs. Pott , ‘
113199	113213	113217	113218	the lieutenant	10093	’ continued Mrs. Pott , raising herself in the arms of her attendant , ‘
113230	113231	113228	113228	Goodwin	444	’ ‘
113241	113278	113239	113239	ma’am	10369	’ said Goodwin . Whatever thoughts the threat of a separation might have awakened in Mr. Pott ’s mind , he forbore to give utterance to them , and contented himself by saying , with great humility:-- ‘
113287	113327	113283	113283	you	10214	’ A fresh train of sobs was the only reply , as Mrs. Pott grew more hysterical , requested to be informed why she was ever born , and required sundry other pieces of information of a similar description . ‘
113331	113336	113283	113283	you	10214	’ remonstrated Mr. Pott , ‘
113390	113417	113369	113369	I	0	’ Mr. Pott cast an imploring look at the innocent cause of the mischief , as if to entreat him to say nothing about the serpent . ‘
113433	113447	113425	113425	you	9716	’ inquired Mr. Winkle , gaining courage as he saw Pott losing it . ‘
113452	113457	113459	113459	he	444	’ observed Mrs. Pott , ‘
113473	113474	113471	113471	Goodwin	444	’ ‘
113486	113491	113483	113483	yourself	10369	’ replied the bodyguard . ‘
113505	113506	113495	113495	he	444	’ ‘
113509	113524	113495	113495	he	444	’ said Pott , as his wife evinced decided symptoms of going off again . ‘
113530	113531	113534	113534	Goodwin	444	’ ‘
113538	113550	113534	113534	Goodwin	444	’ said Mrs. Pott , still undecided about the going off . ‘
113556	113561	113534	113534	Goodwin	444	’ said Mr. Pott ; ‘
113568	113569	113572	113572	Goodwin	444	’ ‘
113574	113579	113572	113572	Goodwin	444	’ resumed Mrs. Pott , ‘
113598	113599	113602	113602	ma’am	10369	’ ‘
113604	113608	113602	113602	ma’am	10369	’ replied Goodwin . ‘
113624	113736	113737	113737	You	444	’ So , as the hysterics were still hovering about , Mr. Pott said once more that he would do it ; but Mrs. Pott was so overcome at the bare idea of having ever been suspected , that she was half a dozen times on the very verge of a relapse , and most unquestionably would have gone off , had it not been for the indefatigable efforts of the assiduous Goodwin , and repeated entreaties for pardon from the conquered Pott ; and finally , when that unhappy individual had been frightened and snubbed down to his proper level , Mrs. Pott recovered , and they went to breakfast . ‘
113754	113767	113751	113752	Mr. Winkle	276	’ said Mrs. Pott , smiling through the traces of her tears . ‘
113772	113816	113817	113817	I	0	’ said Mr. Pott , actuated , as he spoke , by a wish that his visitor would choke himself with the morsel of dry toast which he was raising to his lips at the moment , and so terminate his stay effectually . ‘
113821	113822	113817	113817	I	0	’ ‘
113828	113833	113817	113817	I	0	’ said Mr. Winkle ; ‘
113891	113892	113868	113868	he	244	’ ‘
113899	113904	113894	113894	you	0	’ said Mrs. Pott . ‘
113909	113914	113894	113894	you	0	’ replied Mr. Winkle . ‘
113920	113933	113915	113915	You	444	’ said Mrs. Pott , stealing a tender look at her visitor . ‘
113936	114017	113915	113915	You	444	’ responded Mr. Winkle . The breakfast passed off in silence , for each of the party was brooding over his , or her , own personal grievances . Mrs. Pott was regretting the loss of a beau ; Mr. Pott his rash pledge to horsewhip the _ Independent _ ; Mr. Winkle his having innocently placed himself in so awkward a situation . Noon approached , and after many adieux and promises to return , he tore himself away . ‘
114029	114048	114024	114024	I	0	’ thought Mr. Pott , as he turned into the little back office where he prepared his thunderbolts . ‘
114065	114079	114050	114050	I	0	’ thought Mr. Winkle , as he wended his way to the Peacock , ‘
114092	114217	114220	114220	you	3663	’ His friends were ready , the coach was nearly so , and in half an hour they were proceeding on their journey , along the road over which Mr. Pickwick and Sam had so recently travelled , and of which , as we have already said something , we do not feel called upon to extract Mr. Snodgrass ’s poetical and beautiful description . Mr. Weller was standing at the door of the Angel , ready to receive them , and by that gentleman they were ushered to the apartment of Mr. Pickwick , where , to the no small surprise of Mr. Winkle and Mr. Snodgrass , and the no small embarrassment of Mr. Tupman , they found old Wardle and Trundle . ‘
114222	114234	114220	114220	you	3663	’ said the old man , grasping Mr. Tupman ’s hand . ‘
114271	114293	114267	114267	your	3663	’m very glad you have not . A young fellow like you will do better one of these days , eh ? ’
114310	114322	114324	114326	the old gentleman	10238	‘ Well , and how are you , my fine fellows ? ’
114341	114359	114324	114326	the old gentleman	10238	‘ I have just been telling Pickwick that we must have you all down at Christmas . We ’re
114372	114373	114324	114326	the old gentleman	10238	’ ‘
114377	114386	114324	114326	the old gentleman	10238	’ exclaimed Mr. Snodgrass , turning very pale . ‘
114398	114407	114411	114411	Trundle	290	’ said the good - humoured old man ; ‘
114417	114418	114411	114411	Trundle	290	’ ‘
114425	114443	114411	114411	Trundle	290	’ said Mr. Snodgrass , relieved from a painful doubt which had fallen heavily on his breast . ‘
114454	114455	114452	114452	Joe	241	’ ‘
114459	114465	114452	114452	Joe	241	’ replied the old gentleman . ‘
114470	114471	114452	114452	Joe	241	’ ‘
114483	114486	114452	114452	Joe	241	‘ em ? ’
114487	114491	114452	114452	Joe	241	‘ Quite well . ’
114492	114495	114497	114498	Mr. Tupman	244	‘ Where , ’
114508	114524	114526	114526	She	3672	’ and he turned away his head , and covered his eyes with his hand . ‘
114529	114543	114545	114545	you	9716	’ said the old gentleman , with a knowing shake of the head . ‘
114553	114571	114545	114545	you	9716	’ Mr. Tupman , by a nod , intimated that his question applied to the disappointed Rachael . ‘
114579	114585	114586	114586	She	3672	’ said the old gentleman . ‘
114644	114703	114629	114629	I	0	’ Ample justice was done to the meal ; and when they were seated round the table , after it had been disposed of , Mr. Pickwick , to the intense horror and indignation of his followers , related the adventure he had undergone , and the success which had attended the base artifices of the diabolical Jingle . ‘
114716	114724	114629	114629	I	0	’ said Mr. Pickwick , in conclusion , ‘
114732	114733	114629	114629	I	0	’ ‘
114745	114828	114734	114734	I	0	’ said Mr. Winkle , with a smile ; and , at the request of Mr. Pickwick , he detailed the malicious libel of the Eatanswill _ Independent _ , and the consequent excitement of their friend , the editor . Mr. Pickwick ’s brow darkened during the recital . His friends observed it , and , when Mr. Winkle had concluded , maintained a profound silence . Mr. Pickwick struck the table emphatically with his clenched fist , and spoke as follows:-- ‘
114836	114841	114734	114734	I	0	’ said Mr. Pickwick , ‘
114918	114988	114916	114916	I	0	’ Mr. Pickwick would in all probability have gone on for some time , had not the entrance of Sam , with a letter , caused him to break off in his eloquent discourse . He passed his handkerchief across his forehead , took off his spectacles , wiped them , and put them on again ; and his voice had recovered its wonted softness of tone when he said-- ‘
114996	114997	114994	114994	Sam	240	’ ‘
115021	115026	114994	114994	Sam	240	’ replied Mr. Weller . ‘
115040	115041	115042	115042	I	0	’ ‘
115049	115058	115042	115042	I	0	’ said Mr. Pickwick , opening the letter . ‘
115081	115082	115042	115042	I	0	’ ‘
115088	115094	115095	115095	Nobody	1826	’ was the general inquiry . ‘
115101	115331	115332	115332	Dodson	447	’ said Wardle , alarmed at the horror in Mr. Pickwick ’s countenance . Mr. Pickwick made no reply , but , pushing the letter across the table , and desiring Mr. Tupman to read it aloud , fell back in his chair with a look of vacant astonishment quite alarming to behold . Mr. Tupman , with a trembling voice , read the letter , of which the following is a copy:-- Freeman ’s Court , Cornhill , August 28th , 1827 . Bardell against Pickwick . Sir , Having been instructed by Mrs. Martha Bardell to commence an action against you for a breach of promise of marriage , for which the plaintiff lays her damages at fifteen hundred pounds , we beg to inform you that a writ has been issued against you in this suit in the Court of Common Pleas ; and request to know , by return of post , the name of your attorney in London , who will accept service thereof . We are , Sir , Your obedient servants , Dodson & amp ; Fogg . Mr. Samuel Pickwick . There was something so impressive in the mute astonishment with which each man regarded his neighbour , and every man regarded Mr. Pickwick , that all seemed afraid to speak . The silence was at length broken by Mr. Tupman . ‘
115336	115341	115342	115342	Bardell	369	’ he repeated mechanically . ‘
115346	115353	115342	115342	Bardell	369	’ said Mr. Snodgrass , musing . ‘
115363	115374	115342	115342	Bardell	369	’ murmured Mr. Winkle , with an air of abstraction . ‘
115380	115393	115342	115342	Bardell	369	’ said Mr. Pickwick , at length recovering the power of speech ; ‘
115432	115437	115439	115439	Wardle	292	’ Of her heart , ’
115445	115487	115439	115439	Wardle	292	‘ you should certainly be the best judge . I do n’t wish to discourage you , but I should certainly say that , of her case , Dodson and Fogg are far better judges than any of us can be . ’
115488	115498	115500	115501	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ It ’s a vile attempt to extort money , ’
115503	115509	115511	115511	Wardle	292	‘ I hope it is , ’
115520	115541	115543	115544	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Who ever heard me address her in any way but that in which a lodger would address his landlady ? ’
115550	115563	115543	115544	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Who ever saw me with her ? Not even my friends here-- ’
115564	115570	115572	115573	Mr. Tupman	244	‘ Except on one occasion , ’
115580	115583	115585	115586	Mr. Wardle	292	‘ Ah , ’
115588	115604	115585	115586	Mr. Wardle	292	‘ Well , that ’s important . There was nothing suspicious then , I suppose ? ’
115613	115616	115618	115618	he	244	‘ Why , ’
115620	115646	115618	115618	he	244	‘ there was nothing suspicious ; but -- I do n’t know how it happened , mind -- she certainly was reclining in his arms . ’
115647	115651	115653	115654	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Gracious powers ! ’
115669	115688	115700	115701	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ what a dreadful instance of the force of circumstances ! So she was -- so she was . ’
115689	115698	115700	115701	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ And our friend was soothing her anguish , ’
115706	115711	115713	115714	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ So I was , ’
115716	115727	115713	115714	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I do n’t deny it . So I was . ’
115728	115731	115733	115733	Wardle	292	‘ Hollo ! ’
115735	115763	115765	115765	he	292	‘ for a case in which there ’s nothing suspicious , this looks rather queer -- eh , Pickwick ? Ah , sly dog -- sly dog ! ’
115776	115784	115786	115787	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ What a dreadful conjunction of appearances ! ’
115796	115826	115786	115787	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Winkle -- Tupman -- I beg your pardon for the observations I made just now . We are all the victims of circumstances , and I the greatest . ’
115863	115872	115874	115875	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I ’ll have it explained , though , ’
115885	115903	115912	115912	Wardle	292	‘ I ’ll see this Dodson and Fogg ! I ’ll go to London to - morrow . ’
115904	115910	115912	115912	Wardle	292	‘ Not to - morrow , ’
115914	115916	115912	115912	Wardle	292	‘ you ’re
115920	115921	115912	115912	Wardle	292	’ ‘
115929	115930	115912	115912	Wardle	292	’ ‘
115941	115976	115912	115912	Wardle	292	’re pledged to ride out with us , as far as Sir Geoffrey Manning ’s grounds at all events , and to meet us at lunch , if you do n’t take the field . ’
115977	115986	115988	115989	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Well , then , the day after , ’
115991	115994	115988	115989	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Thursday.--Sam ! ’
115995	115998	116000	116001	Mr. Weller	356	‘ Sir , ’
116003	116020	116000	116001	Mr. Weller	356	‘ Take two places outside to London , on Thursday morning , for yourself and me . ’
116021	116027	116028	116029	Mr. Weller	356	‘ Wery well , Sir . ’
116055	116062	116064	116065	Mr. Weller	356	‘ Rum feller , the hemperor , ’
116075	116078	116068	116068	he	356	‘ Think o ’
116081	116085	116068	116068	he	356	’ up to that ‘
116104	116124	116134	116134	he	356	‘ uns howsoever , as is such steady goers to look at . I did n’t think he ’d ha ’
116137	116141	116147	116149	Mr. Samuel Weller	356	’ done it ! ’
116566	116570	116572	116573	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ I say , ’
116585	116591	116578	116579	the man	835	‘ they do n’t suppose we ’re
116605	116606	116603	116603	they	3711	’ ‘
116610	116615	116603	116603	they	3711	’ exclaimed old Wardle . ‘
116652	116702	116705	116705	Juno	449	’ Mr. Winkle dismounted without saying anything in reply to this observation ; but he thought within himself , that if the party remained in the open air , till he had filled one of the bags , they stood a considerable chance of catching colds in their heads . ‘
116720	116728	116729	116730	Sir Geoffrey	448	’ said Wardle , caressing the dogs . ‘
116740	116808	116738	116738	Martin	366	’ The tall gamekeeper replied in the affirmative , and looked with some surprise from Mr. Winkle , who was holding his gun as if he wished his coat pocket to save him the trouble of pulling the trigger , to Mr. Tupman , who was holding his as if he was afraid of it -- as there is no earthly reason to doubt he really was . ‘
116826	116834	116824	116824	Martin	366	’ said Wardle , noticing the look . ‘
116868	116917	116862	116862	he	276	’ Mr. Winkle smiled feebly over his blue neckerchief in acknowledgment of the compliment , and got himself so mysteriously entangled with his gun , in his modest confusion , that if the piece had been loaded , he must inevitably have shot himself dead upon the spot . ‘
116926	116942	116944	116946	the tall gamekeeper	12325	‘ ere way , when you come to have the charge in it , Sir , ’
116949	116952	116944	116946	the tall gamekeeper	12325	‘ or I ’m
116966	116998	116999	116999	Hollo	303	’ Mr. Winkle , thus admonished , abruptly altered his position , and in so doing , contrived to bring the barrel into pretty smart contact with Mr. Weller ’s head . ‘
117001	117021	117022	117022	Hollo	303	’ said Sam , picking up his hat , which had been knocked off , and rubbing his temple . ‘
117038	117051	117075	117076	Mr. Winkle	276	’ them bags , and something to spare , at one fire . ’
117080	117096	117098	117098	Wardle	292	‘ Where did you tell the boy to meet us with the snack , Martin ? ’
117100	117114	117098	117098	Wardle	292	‘ Side of One - tree Hill , at twelve o’clock , Sir . ’
117115	117127	117053	117057	the leather - legginged boy	3720	‘ That ’s not Sir Geoffrey ’s land , is it ? ’
117128	117166	117173	117174	old Wardle	292	‘ No , Sir ; but it ’s close by it . It ’s Captain Boldwig ’s land ; but there ’ll be nobody to interrupt us , and there ’s a fine bit of turf there . ’
117167	117171	117173	117174	old Wardle	292	‘ Very well , ’
117176	117181	117173	117174	old Wardle	292	‘ Now the sooner we ’re
117197	117263	117187	117187	you	3722	’ Mr. Pickwick was particularly desirous to view the sport , the more especially as he was rather anxious in respect of Mr. Winkle ’s life and limbs . On so inviting a morning , too , it was very tantalising to turn back , and leave his friends to enjoy themselves . It was , therefore , with a very rueful air that he replied-- ‘
117271	117272	117266	117266	I	0	’ ‘
117282	117288	117280	117280	Sir	9716	’ inquired the long gamekeeper . ‘
117291	117295	117280	117280	Sir	9716	’ replied Wardle ; ‘
117302	117303	117297	117297	he	883	’ ‘
117312	117318	117304	117304	I	0	’ said Mr. Pickwick--‘very much . ’
117327	117337	117339	117340	the boy	1304	‘ There ’s a barrow t’other side the hedge , ’
117342	117372	117339	117340	the boy	1304	‘ If the gentleman ’s servant would wheel along the paths , he could keep nigh us , and we could lift it over the stiles , and that . ’
117373	117378	117380	117381	Mr. Weller	356	‘ The wery thing , ’
117399	117418	117391	117391	he	356	‘ The wery thing . Well said , Smallcheek ; I ’ll have it out in a minute . ’
117485	117487	117468	117469	The gamekeeper	3730	‘ punching ’
117542	117547	117549	117550	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Stop , Sam , ’
117562	117569	117571	117571	Wardle	292	‘ What ’s the matter now ? ’
117573	117586	117588	117589	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I wo n’t suffer this barrow to be moved another step , ’
117593	117606	117588	117589	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ unless Winkle carries that gun of his in a different manner . ’
117607	117617	117619	117621	the wretched Winkle	276	‘ How _ am _ I to carry it ? ’
117623	117633	117635	117636	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Carry it with the muzzle to the ground , ’
117638	117644	117646	117646	Winkle	276	‘ It ’s so unsportsmanlike , ’
117648	117660	117662	117663	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I do n’t care whether it ’s unsportsmanlike or not , ’
117665	117689	117662	117663	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I am not going to be shot in a wheel - barrow , for the sake of appearances , to please anybody . ’
117690	117697	117718	117718	I	0	‘ I know the gentleman’ll put that ‘
117707	117713	117662	117663	Mr. Pickwick	240	’ growled the long man . ‘
117723	117735	117718	117718	I	0	’ said poor Winkle , turning his gun - stock uppermost--‘there . ’
117736	117738	117662	117663	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Anythin ’
117744	117755	117662	117663	Mr. Pickwick	240	’ said Mr. Weller ; and on they went again . ‘
117758	117772	117718	117718	I	0	’ said Mr. Pickwick , after they had gone a few yards farther . ‘
117776	117780	117718	117718	I	0	’ said Wardle . ‘
117796	117801	117790	117790	I	0	’ said Mr. Pickwick . ‘
117809	117821	117824	117824	you	0	’ said Mr. Tupman , in a tone of great alarm . ‘
117829	117834	117824	117824	you	0	’ said Mr. Pickwick . ‘
117863	117864	117859	117859	Winkle	276	’ ‘
117873	117879	117881	117881	you	0	’ said the long gamekeeper , ‘
117882	117897	117898	117899	Mr. Tupman	244	’re quite as likely to lodge the charge in yourself as in anything else . ’
117961	117969	117950	117951	the party	9725	‘ What ’s the matter with the dogs ’
117972	117977	117950	117951	the party	9725	’ whispered Mr. Winkle . ‘
117981	117984	118054	118054	they	3742	’re standing . ’
117985	117992	117994	117994	Wardle	292	‘ Hush , ca n’t you ? ’
117997	118004	117994	117994	Wardle	292	‘ Do n’t you see , they ’re
118009	118010	117994	117994	Wardle	292	’ ‘
118015	118047	117994	117994	Wardle	292	’ said Mr. Winkle , staring about him , as if he expected to discover some particular beauty in the landscape , which the sagacious animals were calling special attention to . ‘
118058	118059	118054	118054	they	3742	’ ‘
118065	118080	118054	118054	they	3742	’ said Wardle , not heeding the question in the excitement of the moment . ‘
118084	118131	118054	118054	they	3742	’ There was a sharp whirring noise , that made Mr. Winkle start back as if he had been shot himself . Bang , bang , went a couple of guns -- the smoke swept quickly away over the field , and curled into the air . ‘
118136	118157	118134	118134	they	3742	’ said Mr. Winkle , in a state of the highest excitement , turning round and round in all directions . ‘
118176	118177	118134	118134	they	3742	’ ‘
118182	118201	118134	118134	they	3742	’ said Wardle , taking up a brace of birds which the dogs had deposited at his feet . ‘
118208	118209	118134	118134	they	3742	’ ‘
118219	118225	118214	118214	I	0	’ said the bewildered Winkle . ‘
118234	118243	118244	118244	We	3743	’ replied Wardle , coolly reloading his gun . ‘
118257	118263	118244	118244	We	3743	’ said the long gamekeeper . ‘
118289	118290	118273	118273	he	883	’ ‘
118297	118302	118303	118303	Sam	356	’ roared Mr. Weller . ‘
118305	118318	118319	118319	Sir	9716	’ said Mr. Pickwick , compassionating his follower ’s confusion and embarrassment . ‘
118321	118322	118319	118319	Sir	9716	’ ‘
118327	118328	118332	118332	Sir	9716	’ ‘
118334	118396	118332	118332	Sir	9716	’ So , by way of indemnification , Mr. Weller contorted his features from behind the wheel - barrow , for the exclusive amusement of the boy with the leggings , who thereupon burst into a boisterous laugh , and was summarily cuffed by the long gamekeeper , who wanted a pretext for turning round , to hide his own merriment . ‘
118402	118409	118410	118410	you	9842	’ said Wardle to Mr. Tupman ; ‘
118419	118420	118410	118410	you	9842	’ ‘
118425	118434	118410	118410	you	9842	’ replied Mr. Tupman , with conscious pride . ‘
118440	118441	118435	118435	I	0	’ ‘
118464	118465	118445	118445	You	9842	’ ‘
118473	118478	118445	118445	You	9842	’ said Mr. Tupman . ‘

118508	118516	118494	118494	I	0	’ said the old gentleman , smiling , ‘
118539	118540	118544	118544	Sir	9716	’ ‘
118546	118551	118544	118544	Sir	9716	’ replied Mr. Weller . ‘
118557	118558	118544	118544	Sir	9716	’ ‘
118564	118572	118562	118562	Sir	9716	’ said Sam , raising the barrow . ‘
118577	118593	118562	118562	Sir	9716	’ replied Mr. Pickwick ; and on they went , as briskly as need be . ‘
118600	118627	118562	118562	Sir	9716	’ cried Wardle , when it had been hoisted over a stile into another field , and Mr. Pickwick had been deposited in it once more . ‘
118633	118640	118631	118631	sir	9716	’ replied Mr. Weller , pausing . ‘
118645	118651	118643	118643	Winkle	276	’ said the old gentleman , ‘
118665	118666	118643	118643	Winkle	276	’ ‘
118670	118675	118643	118643	Winkle	276	’ said Mr. Winkle . ‘
118680	118681	118677	118677	they	3753	’ ‘
118694	118761	118677	118677	they	3753	’ On they crept , and very quietly they would have advanced , if Mr. Winkle , in the performance of some very intricate evolutions with his gun , had not accidentally fired , at the most critical moment , over the boy ’s head , exactly in the very spot where the tall man ’s brain would have been , had he been there instead . ‘
118773	118785	118768	118768	you	3754	’ said old Wardle , as the birds flew unharmed away . ‘
118796	118815	118786	118786	I	0	’ replied poor Mr. Winkle , looking at the lock , as if that would do any good . ‘
118831	118832	118824	118824	It	3755	’ ‘
118837	118849	118850	118850	I	0	’ echoed Wardle , with something of irritation in his manner . ‘
118861	118862	118850	118850	I	0	’ ‘
118872	118885	118870	118870	Sir	9716	’ observed the tall man , in a low , prophetic voice . ‘
118896	118903	118894	118894	Sir	9716	’ inquired Mr. Winkle , angrily . ‘
118912	118918	118907	118907	Sir	9716	’ replied the long gamekeeper ; ‘
118957	118958	118952	118952	Sir	9716	’ ‘
118964	118983	118952	118952	Sir	9716	’ cried Mr. Pickwick from the barrow , horror - stricken at the long man ’s dark insinuations . ‘
118995	119299	118993	118993	somebody	9931	’ Nobody , however , volunteered to obey the command ; and Mr. Winkle , after darting a rebellious glance at Mr. Pickwick , reloaded his gun , and proceeded onwards with the rest . We are bound , on the authority of Mr. Pickwick , to state , that Mr. Tupman ’s mode of proceeding evinced far more of prudence and deliberation , than that adopted by Mr. Winkle . Still , this by no means detracts from the great authority of the latter gentleman , on all matters connected with the field ; because , as Mr. Pickwick beautifully observes , it has somehow or other happened , from time immemorial , that many of the best and ablest philosophers , who have been perfect lights of science in matters of theory , have been wholly unable to reduce them to practice . Mr. Tupman ’s process , like many of our most sublime discoveries , was extremely simple . With the quickness and penetration of a man of genius , he had at once observed that the two great points to be attained were-- first , to discharge his piece without injury to himself , and , secondly , to do so , without danger to the bystanders -- obviously , the best thing to do , after surmounting the difficulty of firing at all , was to shut his eyes firmly , and fire into the air . On one occasion , after performing this feat , Mr. Tupman , on opening his eyes , beheld a plump partridge in the act of falling , wounded , to the ground . He was on the point of congratulating Mr. Wardle on his invariable success , when that gentleman advanced towards him , and grasped him warmly by the hand . ‘
119302	119308	119309	119309	you	244	’ said the old gentleman , ‘
119316	119317	119309	119309	you	244	’ ‘
119320	119325	119309	119309	you	244	’ said Mr. Tupman--‘no . ’
119326	119330	119332	119332	Wardle	292	‘ You did , ’
119334	119401	119332	119332	Wardle	292	‘ I saw you do it -- I observed you pick him out -- I noticed you , as you raised your piece to take aim ; and I will say this , that the best shot in existence could not have done it more beautifully . You are an older hand at this than I thought you , Tupman ; you have been out before . ’
119576	119583	119623	119623	Wardle	292	‘ every bullet has its billet . ’
119618	119621	119623	119623	Wardle	292	‘ Well , ’
119646	119654	119623	119623	Wardle	292	‘ smoking day , is n’t it ? ’
119655	119661	119663	119664	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ It is , indeed , ’

119690	119696	119676	119676	I	0	’ said the old gentleman , ‘

119718	119719	119707	119707	You	276	’ ‘

119753	119761	119750	119750	he	3772	’ said Mr. Pickwick , brightening up . ‘

119792	119804	119790	119790	sir	9716	’ said Mr. Weller , invigorated with the prospect of refreshments . ‘

119885	119889	119891	119892	Mr. Weller	356	‘ Weal pie , ’
119905	119943	119897	119897	he	356	‘ Wery good thing is weal pie , when you know the lady as made it , and is quite sure it ai n’t kittens ; and arter all though , where ’s the odds , when they ’re

119966	119971	119962	119962	they	3781	’ said Mr. Pickwick . ‘
119977	119986	119987	119987	I	0	’ replied Mr. Weller , touching his hat . ‘

120319	120334	120336	120337	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ He must have been a very ingenious young man , that , Sam , ’
120344	120350	120352	120353	Mr. Weller	356	‘ Just was , sir , ’

120426	120452	120356	120356	his	356	’ replied the boy , taking from his shoulder a couple of large stone bottles , fastened together by a leathern strap--‘cold punch in t’other . ’
120453	120469	120471	120472	Mr. Weller	356	‘ And a wery good notion of a lunch it is , take it altogether , ’
120484	120506	120471	120472	Mr. Weller	356	‘ Now , gen’l’m’n , “ fall on , ” as the English said to the French when they fixed bagginets . ’
120607	120615	120617	120618	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ This is delightful -- thoroughly delightful ! ’
120637	120649	120651	120651	Wardle	292	‘ So it is -- so it is , old fellow , ’
120653	120661	120651	120651	Wardle	292	‘ Come ; a glass of punch ! ’
120662	120667	120669	120670	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ With great pleasure , ’

120787	120825	120772	120773	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ I ’ll put a stuffed partridge on the top of a post , and practise at it , beginning at a short distance , and lengthening it by degrees . I understand it ’s capital practice . ’
120826	120834	120836	120837	Mr. Weller	356	‘ I know a gen’l’man , Sir , ’
120839	120881	120836	120837	Mr. Weller	356	‘ as did that , and begun at two yards ; but he never tried it on agin ; for he blowed the bird right clean away at the first fire , and nobody ever seed a feather on him arterwards . ’

How long this scene might have lasted , or how much Mr. Pickwick might have suffered , no one can tell , had not a carriage , which was driving swiftly by , suddenly pulled up , from whence there descended old Wardle and Sam Weller , the former of whom , in far less time than it takes to write it , if not to read it , had made his way to Mr. Pickwick ’s side , and placed him in the vehicle , just as the latter had concluded the third and last round of a single combat with the town - beadle . ‘
122784	122790	122629	122629	You	0	’ cried a dozen voices . ‘

122976	122979	122981	122982	old Wardle	292	‘ Because , ’
122990	123010	122981	122982	old Wardle	292	‘ because they might turn on some of us , and say we had taken too much cold punch . ’
123279	123434	123608	123609	Mr. Dodson	447	’ office of Messrs. Dodson & amp ; Fogg was a dark , mouldy , earthy- smelling room , with a high wainscotted partition to screen the clerks from the vulgar gaze , a couple of old wooden chairs , a very loud - ticking clock , an almanac , an umbrella - stand , a row of hat - pegs , and a few shelves , on which were deposited several ticketed bundles of dirty papers , some old deal boxes with paper labels , and sundry decayed stone ink bottles of various shapes and sizes . There was a glass door leading into the passage which formed the entrance to the court , and on the outer side of this glass door , Mr. Pickwick , closely followed by Sam Weller , presented himself on the Friday morning succeeding the occurrence of which a faithful narration is given in the last chapter . ‘
123442	123471	123608	123609	Mr. Dodson	447	’ cried a voice from behind the partition , in reply to Mr. Pickwick ’s gentle tap at the door . And Mr. Pickwick and Sam entered accordingly . ‘
123482	123499	123608	123609	Mr. Dodson	447	’ inquired Mr. Pickwick , gently , advancing , hat in hand , towards the partition . ‘
123514	123607	123608	123609	Mr. Dodson	447	’ replied the voice ; and at the same time the head to which the voice belonged , with a pen behind its ear , looked over the partition , and at Mr. Pickwick . It was a ragged head , the sandy hair of which , scrupulously parted on one side , and flattened down with pomatum , was twisted into little semi- circular tails round a flat face ornamented with a pair of small eyes , and garnished with a very dirty shirt collar , and a rusty black stock . ‘
123622	123632	123616	123617	Mr. Fogg	447	’ said the man to whom the head belonged . ‘
123642	123647	123616	123617	Mr. Fogg	447	’ inquired Mr. Pickwick . ‘
123652	123653	123616	123617	Mr. Fogg	447	’ ‘
123666	123667	123616	123617	Mr. Fogg	447	’ ‘
123672	123708	123616	123617	Mr. Fogg	447	’ Here the man proceeded to mend his pen with great deliberation , while another clerk , who was mixing a Seidlitz powder , under cover of the lid of his desk , laughed approvingly . ‘
123715	123749	123711	123711	I	0	’ said Mr. Pickwick . There was no reply ; so Mr. Pickwick sat down unbidden , and listened to the loud ticking of the clock and the murmured conversation of the clerks . ‘
123759	123794	123711	123711	I	0	’ said one of the gentlemen , in a brown coat and brass buttons , inky drabs , and bluchers , at the conclusion of some inaudible relation of his previous evening ’s adventures . ‘
123801	123809	123711	123711	I	0	’ said the Seidlitz - powder man . ‘
123817	123826	123810	123811	Tom Cummins	461	’ said the man with the brown coat . ‘
123871	123882	123887	123887	he	0	‘ ooman . I say , I wonder what old Fogg ‘
123902	123915	123897	123897	I	0	’ At this humorous notion , all the clerks laughed in concert . ‘
123927	123929	123931	123936	the man in the brown coat	3879	’ , ’
123938	123990	123931	123936	the man in the brown coat	3879	‘ while Jack was upstairs sorting the papers , and you two were gone to the stamp - office . Fogg was down here , opening the letters when that chap as we issued the writ against at Camberwell , you know , came in -- what ’s his name again ? ’
123991	123994	123996	124003	the clerk who had spoken to Mr. Pickwick	3880	‘ Ramsey , ’
124005	124643	124645	124645	Wicks	466	‘ Ah , Ramsey -- a precious seedy - looking customer . “ Well , sir , ” says old Fogg , looking at him very fierce -- you know his way--“well , Sir , have you come to settle ? ” “ Yes , I have , sir , ” said Ramsey , putting his hand in his pocket , and bringing out the money , “ the debt ’s two pound ten , and the costs three pound five , and here it is , Sir ; ” and he sighed like bricks , as he lugged out the money , done up in a bit of blotting - paper . Old Fogg looked first at the money , and then at him , and then he coughed in his rum way , so that I knew something was coming . “ You do n’t know there ’s a declaration filed , which increases the costs materially , I suppose , ” said Fogg . “ You do n’t say that , sir , ” said Ramsey , starting back ; “ the time was only out last night , Sir . ” “ I do say it , though , ” said Fogg , “ my clerk ’s just gone to file it . Has n’t Mr. Jackson gone to file that declaration in Bullman and Ramsey , Mr. Wicks ? ” Of course I said yes , and then Fogg coughed again , and looked at Ramsey . “ My God ! ” said Ramsey ; “ and here have I nearly driven myself mad , scraping this money together , and all to no purpose . ” “ None at all , ” said Fogg coolly ; “ so you had better go back and scrape some more together , and bring it here in time . ” “ I ca n’t get it , by God ! ” said Ramsey , striking the desk with his fist . “ Do n’t bully me , sir , ” said Fogg , getting into a passion on purpose . “ I am not bullying you , sir , ” said Ramsey . “ You are , ” said Fogg ; “ get out , sir ; get out of this office , Sir , and come back , Sir , when you know how to behave yourself . ” Well , Ramsey tried to speak , but Fogg would n’t let him , so he put the money in his pocket , and sneaked out . The door was scarcely shut , when old Fogg turned round to me , with a sweet smile on his face , and drew the declaration out of his coat pocket . “ Here , Wicks , ” says Fogg , “ take a cab , and go down to the Temple as quick as you can , and file that . The costs are quite safe , for he ’s a steady man with a large family , at a salary of five - and - twenty shillings a week , and if he gives us a warrant of attorney , as he must in the end , I know his employers will see it paid ; so we may as well get all we can get out of him , Mr. Wicks ; it ’s a Christian act to do it , Mr. Wicks , for with his large family and small income , he ’ll be all the better for a good lesson against getting into debt -- won’t he , Mr. Wicks , wo n’t he?”-- and he smiled so good - naturedly as he went away , that it was delightful to see him . He is a capital man of business , ’
124655	124662	124645	124645	Wicks	466	‘ capital , is n’t he ? ’
124681	124689	124691	124692	Mr. Weller	356	‘ Nice men these here , Sir , ’
124697	124708	124691	124692	Mr. Weller	356	‘ wery nice notion of fun they has , Sir . ’
124751	124760	124762	124762	Jackson	464	‘ I wonder whether Fogg ’s disengaged now ? ’
124764	124769	124771	124771	Wicks	466	‘ I ’ll see , ’
124779	124788	124771	124771	Wicks	466	‘ What name shall I tell Mr. Fogg ? ’
124789	124792	124794	124799	the illustrious subject of these memoirs	3885	‘ Pickwick , ’
124837	124846	124848	124848	Wicks	466	‘ What did he say his name was ? ’
124850	124853	124855	124855	Jackson	464	‘ Pickwick , ’
124857	124867	124855	124855	Jackson	464	‘ it ’s the defendant in Bardell and Pickwick . ’

124918	124927	124915	124916	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ what do you mean by twigging me ? ’
125105	125108	125123	125123	Jackson	464	‘ Mr. Fogg ’
125131	125137	125139	125140	Mr. Fogg	447	‘ Is Mr. Dodson in ? ’
125142	125149	125151	125151	Jackson	464	‘ Just come in , Sir , ’
125153	125160	125151	125151	Jackson	464	‘ Ask him to step here . ’
125161	125166	125167	125168	Exit Jackson	467	‘ Yes , sir . ’
125170	125177	125179	125179	Fogg	447	‘ Take a seat , sir , ’
125181	125206	125179	125179	Fogg	447	‘ there is the paper , sir ; my partner will be here directly , and we can converse about this matter , sir . ’

125338	125342	125347	125348	the defendant	3897	’ said Fogg . ‘
125357	125361	125345	125345	You	240	’ said Dodson . ‘

125423	125428	125430	125430	Dodson	447	‘ Hush , Fogg , ’
125432	125443	125430	125430	Dodson	447	‘ let me hear what Mr. Pickwick has to say . ’
125444	125450	125452	125453	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I came , gentlemen , ’
125462	125497	125452	125453	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I came here , gentlemen , to express the surprise with which I received your letter of the other day , and to inquire what grounds of action you can have against me . ’

125539	125543	125536	125537	Mr. Dodson	447	’ said Fogg . ‘

125715	125759	125706	125706	I	0	’ Here Dodson drew himself up , with an air of offended virtue , and looked at Fogg , who thrust his hands farther in his pockets , and nodding his head sagely , said , in a tone of the fullest concurrence , ‘

125769	125782	125783	125783	you	9716	’ said Mr. Pickwick , with considerable pain depicted in his countenance , ‘

125815	125819	125810	125810	you	9716	’ replied Dodson ; ‘

125919	125934	125902	125903	Mr. Fogg	447	’ said Fogg , handing over a square book , with a parchment cover . ‘
125940	125944	125980	125980	Sir	9716	’ resumed Dodson . ‘
125984	125994	125980	125980	Sir	9716	’ Dodson coughed and looked at Fogg , who said ‘
125997	126009	125980	125980	Sir	9716	’ also . And then they both looked at Mr. Pickwick . ‘
126017	126022	125980	125980	Sir	9716	’ said Mr. Pickwick , ‘

126044	126060	126040	126040	you	9716	’ replied Dodson , with something as near a smile as his importance would allow . ‘

126124	126132	126117	126118	Mrs. Bardell	369	’ observed Fogg , glancing at Dodson , ‘

126147	126182	126134	126134	she	369	’ replied Dodson sternly . For the action was only just begun ; and it would n’t have done to let Mr. Pickwick compromise it then , even if he had been so disposed . ‘
126191	126221	126184	126184	you	9716	’ said Dodson , displaying a slip of parchment in his right hand , and affectionately pressing a paper copy of it , on Mr. Pickwick with his left , ‘

126370	126384	126368	126368	Sir	9716	’ said the two clerks , appearing at the bottom of the stairs . ‘

126652	126714	126650	126650	Sir	9716	’ As Fogg put himself very temptingly within the reach of Mr. Pickwick ’s clenched fist , there is little doubt that that gentleman would have complied with his earnest entreaty , but for the interposition of Sam , who , hearing the dispute , emerged from the office , mounted the stairs , and seized his master by the arm . ‘
126720	126725	126715	126715	You	9716	’ said Mr. Weller . ‘

The recollection of all the wrongs he had sustained at Jingle ’s hands , had crowded on Mr. Pickwick ’s mind , the moment Mr. Weller began to speak ; it wanted but a feather to turn the scale , and ‘
128635	128639	128643	128643	him	4012	’ did it . ‘

131517	131527	131500	131502	the old man	1779	‘ aha ! who was talking about the inns ? ’
131528	131534	131536	131537	Mr. Pickwick--‘I	482	‘ I was , Sir , ’

131999	132053	131993	131993	I	0	’ And the old man rubbed his hands , and leered as if in delight at having found another point of view in which to place his favourite subject . Mr. Pickwick eyed the old man with great curiosity , and the remainder of the company smiled , and looked on in silence . ‘

132741	132761	132739	132739	Sir	9716	’ said Mr. Pickwick , minutely scanning the old man ’s countenance , by the aid of his glasses . ‘
132764	132771	132739	132739	Sir	9716	’ said the little old man . ‘

132798	132804	132810	132810	they	4148	’ exclaimed Mr. Pickwick involuntarily . ‘
132813	132836	132839	132840	another man	4136	’ replied the little old man , with a diabolical leer ; and then , without pausing for an answer , he continued-- ‘
133108	134039	134041	134043	the old man	1779	’ time , when his eyes encountered the glass doors of the wooden press . “ Ah , ” says he , “ if I had n’t been obliged to take that ugly article at the old broker ’s valuation , I might have got something comfortable for the money . I ’ll tell you what it is , old fellow , ” he said , speaking aloud to the press , having nothing else to speak to , “ if it would n’t cost more to break up your old carcass , than it would ever be worth afterward , I ’d have a fire out of you in less than no time . ” He had hardly spoken the words , when a sound resembling a faint groan , appeared to issue from the interior of the case . It startled him at first , but thinking , on a moment ’s reflection , that it must be some young fellow in the next chamber , who had been dining out , he put his feet on the fender , and raised the poker to stir the fire . At that moment , the sound was repeated ; and one of the glass doors slowly opening , disclosed a pale and emaciated figure in soiled and worn apparel , standing erect in the press . The figure was tall and thin , and the countenance expressive of care and anxiety ; but there was something in the hue of the skin , and gaunt and unearthly appearance of the whole form , which no being of this world was ever seen to wear . “ Who are you ? ” said the new tenant , turning very pale ; poising the poker in his hand , however , and taking a very decent aim at the countenance of the figure . “ Who are you ? ” “ Do n’t throw that poker at me , ” replied the form ; “ if you hurled it with ever so sure an aim , it would pass through me , without resistance , and expend its force on the wood behind . I am a spirit . ” “ And pray , what do you want here ? ” faltered the tenant . “ In this room , ” replied the apparition , “ my worldly ruin was worked , and I and my children beggared . In this press , the papers in a long , long suit , which accumulated for years , were deposited . In this room , when I had died of grief , and long - deferred hope , two wily harpies divided the wealth for which I had contested during a wretched existence , and of which , at last , not one farthing was left for my unhappy descendants . I terrified them from the spot , and since that day have prowled by night -- the only period at which I can revisit the earth -- about the scenes of my long - protracted misery . This apartment is mine : leave it to me . ” “ If you insist upon making your appearance here , ” said the tenant , who had had time to collect his presence of mind during this prosy statement of the ghost ’s , “ I shall give up possession with the greatest pleasure ; but I should like to ask you one question , if you will allow me . ” “ Say on , ” said the apparition sternly . “ Well , ” said the tenant , “ I do n’t apply the observation personally to you , because it is equally applicable to most of the ghosts I ever heard of ; but it does appear to me somewhat inconsistent , that when you have an opportunity of visiting the fairest spots of earth -- for I suppose space is nothing to you -- you should always return exactly to the very places where you have been most miserable . ” “ Egad , that ’s very true ; I never thought of that before , ” said the ghost . “ You see , Sir , ” pursued the tenant , “ this is a very uncomfortable room . From the appearance of that press , I should be disposed to say that it is not wholly free from bugs ; and I really think you might find much more comfortable quarters : to say nothing of the climate of London , which is extremely disagreeable . ” “ You are very right , Sir , ” said the ghost politely , “ it never struck me till now ; I ’ll try change of air directly”--and , in fact , he began to vanish as he spoke ; his legs , indeed , had quite disappeared . “ And if , Sir , ” said the tenant , calling after him , “ if you _ would _ have the goodness to suggest to the other ladies and gentlemen who are now engaged in haunting old empty houses , that they might be much more comfortable elsewhere , you will confer a very great benefit on society . ” “ I will , ” replied the ghost ; “ we must be dull fellows -- very dull fellows , indeed ; I ca n’t imagine how we can have been so stupid . ” With these words , the spirit disappeared ; and what is rather remarkable , ’

134294	134300	134276	134276	he	1779	’ said the old man , ‘
134394	134428	134475	134477	The condemned felon	4168	‘ In the Borough High Street , near St. George ’s Church , and on the same side of the way , stands , as most people know , the smallest of our debtors ’
134520	134657	134658	134669	Many eyes , that have long since been closed in the grave	4172	‘ It may be my fancy , or it may be that I can not separate the place from the old recollections associated with it , but this part of London I can not bear . The street is broad , the shops are spacious , the noise of passing vehicles , the footsteps of a perpetual stream of people -- all the busy sounds of traffic , resound in it from morn to midnight ; but the streets around are mean and close ; poverty and debauchery lie festering in the crowded alleys ; want and misfortune are pent up in the narrow prison ; an air of gloom and dreariness seems , in my eyes at least , to hang about the scene , and to impart to it a squalid and sickly hue . ‘
134862	135159	135160	135161	The father	10481	‘ Twenty years ago , that pavement was worn with the footsteps of a mother and child , who , day by day , so surely as the morning came , presented themselves at the prison gate ; often after a night of restless misery and anxious thoughts , were they there , a full hour too soon , and then the young mother turning meekly away , would lead the child to the old bridge , and raising him in her arms to show him the glistening water , tinted with the light of the morning ’s sun , and stirring with all the bustling preparations for business and pleasure that the river presented at that early hour , endeavour to interest his thoughts in the objects before him . But she would quickly set him down , and hiding her face in her shawl , give vent to the tears that blinded her ; for no expression of interest or amusement lighted up his thin and sickly face . His recollections were few enough , but they were all of one kind -- all connected with the poverty and misery of his parents . Hour after hour had he sat on his mother ’s knee , and with childish sympathy watched the tears that stole down her face , and then crept quietly away into some dark corner , and sobbed himself to sleep . The hard realities of the world , with many of its worst privations -- hunger and thirst , and cold and want -- had all come home to him , from the first dawnings of reason ; and though the form of childhood was there , its light heart , its merry laugh , and sparkling eyes were wanting . ‘
135242	135343	135344	135344	They	4182	‘ Winter came , and with it weeks of cold and heavy rain . The poor girl had removed to a wretched apartment close to the spot of her husband ’s imprisonment ; and though the change had been rendered necessary by their increasing poverty , she was happier now , for she was nearer him . For two months , she and her little companion watched the opening of the gate as usual . One day she failed to come , for the first time . Another morning arrived , and she came alone . The child was dead . ‘
135460	135547	135458	135459	his parents	12685	’ feet for hours together , with his little hands patiently folded in each other , and his thin wan face raised towards them . They had seen him pine away , from day to day ; and though his brief existence had been a joyless one , and he was now removed to that peace and rest which , child as he was , he had never known in this world , they were his parents , and his loss sank deep into their souls . ‘
135631	135693	135702	135702	she	1322	‘ She had fainted one evening in her husband ’s arms , and he had borne her to the open window , to revive her with the air , when the light of the moon falling full upon her face , showed him a change upon her features , which made him stagger beneath her weight , like a helpless infant . ‘
135728	135794	135706	135706	He	357	‘ “ It is very hard to leave you , George , ” she said ; “ but it is God ’s will , and you must bear it for my sake . Oh ! how I thank Him for having taken our boy ! He is happy , and in heaven now . What would he have done here , without his mother ! ” ‘
135867	135950	135960	135961	the man	835	‘ “ Never again , George ; never again , ” said the dying woman . “ Let them lay me by my poor boy now , but promise me , that if ever you leave this dreadful place , and should grow rich , you will have us removed to some quiet country churchyard , a long , long way off -- very far from here-- where we can rest in peace . Dear George , promise me you will . ” ‘
135989	136054	135960	135961	the man	835	‘ He ceased to speak : for the arm that clasped his neck grew stiff and heavy . A deep sigh escaped from the wasted form before him ; the lips moved , and a smile played upon the face ; but the lips were pallid , and the smile faded into a rigid and ghastly stare . He was alone in the world . ‘
136157	136293	136298	136298	his	835	‘ The deepest despair , and passion scarcely human , had made such fierce ravages on his face and form , in that one night , that his companions in misfortune shrank affrighted from him as he passed by . His eyes were bloodshot and heavy , his face a deadly white , and his body bent as if with age . He had bitten his under lip nearly through in the violence of his mental suffering , and the blood which had flowed from the wound had trickled down his chin , and stained his shirt and neckerchief . No tear , or sound of complaint escaped him ; but the unsettled look , and disordered haste with which he paced up and down the yard , denoted the fever which was burning within . ‘
136505	136920	136921	136921	He	4226	‘ Although for many weeks after this , he was watched , night and day , in the wildest ravings of fever , neither the consciousness of his loss , nor the recollection of the vow he had made , ever left him for a moment . Scenes changed before his eyes , place succeeded place , and event followed event , in all the hurry of delirium ; but they were all connected in some way with the great object of his mind . He was sailing over a boundless expanse of sea , with a blood - red sky above , and the angry waters , lashed into fury beneath , boiling and eddying up , on every side . There was another vessel before them , toiling and labouring in the howling storm ; her canvas fluttering in ribbons from the mast , and her deck thronged with figures who were lashed to the sides , over which huge waves every instant burst , sweeping away some devoted creatures into the foaming sea . Onward they bore , amidst the roaring mass of water , with a speed and force which nothing could resist ; and striking the stem of the foremost vessel , crushed her beneath their keel . From the huge whirlpool which the sinking wreck occasioned , arose a shriek so loud and shrill-- the death - cry of a hundred drowning creatures , blended into one fierce yell -- that it rung far above the war - cry of the elements , and echoed , and re - echoed till it seemed to pierce air , sky , and ocean . But what was that -- that old gray head that rose above the water ’s surface , and with looks of agony , and screams for aid , buffeted with the waves ! One look , and he had sprung from the vessel ’s side , and with vigorous strokes was swimming towards it . He reached it ; he was close upon it . They were _ his _ features . The old man saw him coming , and vainly strove to elude his grasp . But he clasped him tight , and dragged him beneath the water . Down , down with him , fifty fathoms down ; his struggles grew fainter and fainter , until they wholly ceased . He was dead ; he had killed him , and had kept his oath . ‘
137239	137458	137459	137459	He	4235	‘ When the fever left him , and consciousness returned , he awoke to find himself rich and free , to hear that the parent who would have let him die in jail--_would _ ! who _ had _ let those who were far dearer to him than his own existence die of want , and sickness of heart that medicine can not cure -- had been found dead in his bed of down . He had had all the heart to leave his son a beggar , but proud even of his health and strength , had put off the act till it was too late , and now might gnash his teeth in the other world , at the thought of the wealth his remissness had left him . He awoke to this , and he awoke to more . To recollect the purpose for which he lived , and to remember that his enemy was his wife ’s own father -- the man who had cast him into prison , and who , when his daughter and her child sued at his feet for mercy , had spurned them from his door . Oh , how he cursed the weakness that prevented him from being up , and active , in his scheme of vengeance ! ‘
137540	137644	137645	137645	He	4235	‘ It was summer - time ; and wrapped in his gloomy thoughts , he would issue from his solitary lodgings early in the evening , and wandering along a narrow path beneath the cliffs , to a wild and lonely spot that had struck his fancy in his ramblings , seat himself on some fallen fragment of the rock , and burying his face in his hands , remain there for hours-- sometimes until night had completely closed in , and the long shadows of the frowning cliffs above his head cast a thick , black darkness on every object near him . ‘
137762	137851	137753	137753	he	4235	‘ The tale told itself at once : some scattered garments lay on the beach ; a human head was just visible above the waves at a little distance from the shore ; and an old man , wringing his hands in agony , was running to and fro , shrieking for assistance . The invalid , whose strength was now sufficiently restored , threw off his coat , and rushed towards the sea , with the intention of plunging in , and dragging the drowning man ashore . ‘
137918	137946	137953	137955	the old man	1779	‘ At the first word the old man uttered , the stranger checked himself in his career , and , folding his arms , stood perfectly motionless . ‘
137963	137972	137978	137980	the old man	1779	‘ The stranger smiled , and was silent . ‘
138018	138048	138049	138050	The stranger	9737	‘ “ Hark ! ” said the old man . “ He cries once more . He is alive yet . Heyling , save him , save him ! ” ‘
138061	138151	138157	138158	the stranger	9737	‘ “ I have wronged you , ” shrieked the old man , falling on his knees , and clasping his hands together . “ Be revenged ; take my all , my life ; cast me into the water at your feet , and , if human nature can repress a struggle , I will die , without stirring hand or foot . Do it , Heyling , do it , but save my boy ; he is so young , Heyling , so young to die ! ” ‘
138256	138314	138233	138233	his	4262	‘ As the stranger spoke , he pointed to the sea . A faint cry died away upon its surface ; the last powerful struggle of the dying man agitated the rippling waves for a few seconds ; and the spot where he had gone down into his early grave , was undistinguishable from the surrounding water . ‘
138433	138451	138452	138453	The attorney	1938	‘ “ I wish you to undertake some legal business for me , ” said the stranger . ‘
138480	138508	138509	138510	The attorney	1938	‘ “ It is no common business , ” said he ; “ nor have these papers reached my hands without long trouble and great expense . ” ‘
138548	138670	138522	138523	his visitor	12268	‘ “ Upon these papers , ” said the client , “ the man whose name they bear , has raised , as you will see , large sums of money , for years past . There was a tacit understanding between him and the men into whose hands they originally went -- and from whom I have by degrees purchased the whole , for treble and quadruple their nominal value -- that these loans should be from time to time renewed , until a given period had elapsed . Such an understanding is nowhere expressed . He has sustained many losses of late ; and these obligations accumulating upon him at once , would crush him to the earth . ” ‘
138691	138701	138683	138684	the attorney	1938	‘ “ It is , ” said the client . ‘
138716	138820	138711	138714	the man of business	3895	‘ “ Do ! ” replied the client , with sudden vehemence . “ Put every engine of the law in force , every trick that ingenuity can devise and rascality execute ; fair means and foul ; the open oppression of the law , aided by all the craft of its most ingenious practitioners . I would have him die a harassing and lingering death . Ruin him , seize and sell his lands and goods , drive him from house and home , and drag him forth a beggar in his old age , to die in a common jail . ” ‘
138870	138934	138935	138936	The attorney	1938	‘ “ Name any sum , ” said the stranger , his hand trembling so violently with excitement , that he could scarcely hold the pen he seized as he spoke-- “ any sum , and it is yours . Do n’t be afraid to name it , man . I shall not think it dear , if you gain my object . ” ‘
139007	139186	138989	138990	The stranger	9737	‘ The draft was duly honoured , and the attorney , finding that his strange client might be safely relied upon , commenced his work in earnest . For more than two years afterwards , Mr. Heyling would sit whole days together , in the office , poring over the papers as they accumulated , and reading again and again , his eyes gleaming with joy , the letters of remonstrance , the prayers for a little delay , the representations of the certain ruin in which the opposite party must be involved , which poured in , as suit after suit , and process after process , was commenced . To all applications for a brief indulgence , there was but one reply -- the money must be paid . Land , house , furniture , each in its turn , was taken under some one of the numerous executions which were issued ; and the old man himself would have been immured in prison had he not escaped the vigilance of the officers , and fled . ‘
139328	139430	139478	139478	Heyling	485	‘ At length late one night , Heyling , of whom nothing had been seen for many weeks before , appeared at his attorney ’s private residence , and sent up word that a gentleman wished to see him instantly . Before the attorney , who had recognised his voice from above stairs , could order the servant to admit him , he had rushed up the staircase , and entered the drawing - room pale and breathless . Having closed the door , to prevent being overheard , he sank into a chair , and said , in a low voice-- ‘
139442	139463	139478	139478	Heyling	485	‘ “ No ! ” said the attorney . “ Well done , my dear sir , well done . ” ‘
139522	139546	139574	139574	he	0	‘ “ Very good , ” said the attorney . “ You will have the caption made to- morrow , of course ? ” ‘
139605	139626	139574	139574	he	0	‘ “ Very good , ” said the attorney . “ Will you write down instructions for the officer ? ” ‘
139650	139762	139769	139769	he	485	‘ They met on the appointed night , and , hiring a hackney - coach , directed the driver to stop at that corner of the old Pancras Road , at which stands the parish workhouse . By the time they alighted there , it was quite dark ; and , proceeding by the dead wall in front of the Veterinary Hospital , they entered a small by - street , which is , or was at that time , called Little College Street , and which , whatever it may be now , was in those days a desolate place enough , surrounded by little else than fields and ditches . ‘
139847	139895	139820	139820	Heyling	485	‘ The object of his search and his unrelenting animosity , now a decrepit old man , was seated at a bare deal table , on which stood a miserable candle . He started on the entrance of the stranger , and rose feebly to his feet . ‘
139923	139964	139965	139967	The old man	1779	‘ “ A word with _ you _ , ” replied Heyling . As he spoke , he seated himself at the other end of the table , and , throwing off his cloak and cap , disclosed his features . ‘
140001	140110	139974	139974	He	1779	‘ “ This day six years , ” said Heyling , “ I claimed the life you owed me for my child ’s . Beside the lifeless form of your daughter , old man , I swore to live a life of revenge . I have never swerved from my purpose for a moment ’s space ; but if I had , one thought of her uncomplaining , suffering look , as she drooped away , or of the starving face of our innocent child , would have nerved me to my task . My first act of requital you well remember : this is my last . ” ‘
140125	140164	140165	140165	He	1779	‘ “ I leave England to - morrow , ” said Heyling , after a moment ’s pause . “ To- night I consign you to the living death to which you devoted her -- a hopeless prison-- ” ‘
140197	140255	140179	140179	He	1779	‘ “ You had better see to the old man , ” he said to the woman , as he opened the door , and motioned the officer to follow him into the street . “ I think he is ill . ” The woman closed the door , ran hastily upstairs , and found him lifeless . ‘
140344	140491	140493	140493	your	4324	’ As the old man concluded his tale , he advanced to a peg in one corner , and taking down his hat and coat , put them on with great deliberation ; and , without saying another word , walked slowly away . As the gentleman with the Mosaic studs had fallen asleep , and the major part of the company were deeply occupied in the humorous process of dropping melted tallow - grease into his brandy - and - water , Mr. Pickwick departed unnoticed , and having settled his own score , and that of Mr. Weller , issued forth , in company with that gentleman , from beneath the portal of the Magpie and Stump .

140535	140546	140548	140549	Mr. Weller	356	’ made a worser guess than that , old feller , ’

Keeping the curtains carefully closed with his hand , so that nothing more of him could be seen than his face and nightcap , and putting on his spectacles , he mustered up courage and looked out . Mr. Pickwick almost fainted with horror and dismay . Standing before the dressing - glass was a middle - aged lady , in yellow curl - papers , busily engaged in brushing what ladies call their ‘
146727	146800	146385	146385	himself	240	’ However the unconscious middle - aged lady came into that room , it was quite clear that she contemplated remaining there for the night ; for she had brought a rushlight and shade with her , which , with praiseworthy precaution against fire , she had stationed in a basin on the floor , where it was glimmering away , like a gigantic lighthouse in a particularly small piece of water . ‘
146805	146810	146385	146385	himself	240	’ thought Mr. Pickwick , ‘
146816	146817	146818	146818	Hem	296	’ ‘
146820	146837	146818	146818	Hem	296	’ said the lady ; and in went Mr. Pickwick ’s head with automaton- like rapidity . ‘
146848	146864	146838	146838	I	0	’ thought poor Mr. Pickwick , the cold perspiration starting in drops upon his nightcap . ‘
146871	146937	146818	146818	Hem	296	’ It was quite impossible to resist the urgent desire to see what was going forward . So out went Mr. Pickwick ’s head again . The prospect was worse than before . The middle - aged lady had finished arranging her hair ; had carefully enveloped it in a muslin nightcap with a small plaited border ; and was gazing pensively on the fire . ‘
146944	146951	146952	146952	I	0	’ reasoned Mr. Pickwick with himself . ‘
147011	147100	147275	147275	ma’am	10369	’ Mr. Pickwick , it is quite unnecessary to say , was one of the most modest and delicate - minded of mortals . The very idea of exhibiting his nightcap to a lady overpowered him , but he had tied those confounded strings in a knot , and , do what he would , he could n’t get it off . The disclosure must be made . There was only one other way of doing it . He shrunk behind the curtains , and called out very loudly-- ‘
147105	147177	147275	147275	ma’am	10369	’ That the lady started at this unexpected sound was evident , by her falling up against the rushlight shade ; that she persuaded herself it must have been the effect of imagination was equally clear , for when Mr. Pickwick , under the impression that she had fainted away stone - dead with fright , ventured to peep out again , she was gazing pensively on the fire as before . ‘
147183	147192	147275	147275	ma’am	10369	’ thought Mr. Pickwick , popping in again . ‘
147197	147248	147275	147275	ma’am	10369	’ These last sounds , so like those in which , as legends inform us , the ferocious giant Blunderbore was in the habit of expressing his opinion that it was time to lay the cloth , were too distinctly audible to be again mistaken for the workings of fancy . ‘
147252	147260	147249	147250	Gracious Heaven	316	’ said the middle - aged lady , ‘
147265	147266	147249	147250	Gracious Heaven	316	’ ‘
147277	147287	147288	147289	A gentleman	10108	’ said Mr. Pickwick , from behind the curtains . ‘
147291	147301	147288	147289	A gentleman	10108	’ said the lady , with a terrific scream . ‘
147307	147312	147313	147315	A strange man	4512	’ thought Mr. Pickwick . ‘
147317	147341	147313	147315	A strange man	4512	’ shrieked the lady . Another instant and the house would be alarmed . Her garments rustled as she rushed towards the door . ‘
147344	147360	147342	147342	Ma’am	445	’ said Mr. Pickwick , thrusting out his head in the extremity of his desperation , ‘
147363	147468	147469	147469	Wretch	491	’ Now , although Mr. Pickwick was not actuated by any definite object in putting out his head , it was instantaneously productive of a good effect . The lady , as we have already stated , was near the door . She must pass it , to reach the staircase , and she would most undoubtedly have done so by this time , had not the sudden apparition of Mr. Pickwick ’s nightcap driven her back into the remotest corner of the apartment , where she stood staring wildly at Mr. Pickwick , while Mr. Pickwick in his turn stared wildly at her . ‘
147471	147483	147469	147469	Wretch	491	’ said the lady , covering her eyes with her hands , ‘
147490	147491	147486	147486	you	491	’ ‘
147501	147507	147499	147499	ma’am	10369	’ said Mr. Pickwick earnestly . ‘
147510	147518	147521	147521	ma’am	10369	’ said the lady , looking up . ‘
147527	147547	147521	147521	ma’am	10369	’ said Mr. Pickwick , nodding his head so energetically , that the tassel of his nightcap danced again . ‘
147639	147640	147634	147634	you	10369	’ ‘
147651	147659	147660	147660	you	9716	’ said the lady , sobbing violently , ‘
147666	147667	147668	147668	I	0	’ ‘
147678	147683	147668	147668	I	0	’ replied Mr. Pickwick . ‘
147688	147693	147686	147686	sir	9716	’ said the lady . ‘
147698	147706	147696	147696	ma’am	10369	’ interposed Mr. Pickwick , very quickly . ‘
147721	147736	147713	147713	I	0	’ said Mr. Pickwick , making his appearance at the bottom of the bed , ‘
147754	147830	147752	147752	ma’am	10369	’ The lady pointed to the door . One excellent quality of Mr. Pickwick ’s character was beautifully displayed at this moment , under the most trying circumstances . Although he had hastily put on his hat over his nightcap , after the manner of the old patrol ; although he carried his shoes and gaiters in his hand , and his coat and waistcoat over his arm ; nothing could subdue his native politeness . ‘
147838	147847	147831	147831	I	0	’ said Mr. Pickwick , bowing very low . ‘
147862	147867	147854	147854	you	0	’ said the lady . ‘
147877	147898	147875	147875	ma’am	10369	’ said Mr. Pickwick , opening the door , and dropping both his shoes with a crash in so doing . ‘
147904	147947	147902	147902	ma’am	10369	’ resumed Mr. Pickwick , gathering up his shoes , and turning round to bow again--‘I trust , ma’am , that my unblemished character , and the devoted respect I entertain for your sex , will plead as some slight excuse for this-- ’
148260	148263	148265	148266	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Sam , ’
148273	148279	148265	148266	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ where ’s my bedroom ? ’
148322	148325	148327	148328	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Sam , ’
148336	148356	148327	148328	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I have made one of the most extraordinary mistakes to - night , that ever were heard of . ’
148357	148363	148365	148366	Mr. Weller	356	‘ Wery likely , Sir , ’
148369	148379	148381	148382	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ But of this I am determined , Sam , ’
148384	148410	148381	148382	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ that if I were to stop in this house for six months , I would never trust myself about it , alone , again . ’
148411	148426	148428	148429	Mr. Weller	356	‘ That ’s the wery prudentest resolution as you could come to , Sir , ’
148431	148450	148428	148429	Mr. Weller	356	‘ You rayther want somebody to look arter you , Sir , when your judgment goes out a wisitin ’
148452	148453	148428	148429	Mr. Weller	356	’ ‘
148463	148501	148461	148461	Sam	356	’ said Mr. Pickwick . He raised himself in bed , and extended his hand , as if he were about to say something more ; but suddenly checking himself , turned round , and bade his valet ‘
148505	148506	148461	148461	Sam	356	’ ‘
148513	148770	148511	148511	Sir	9716	’ replied Mr. Weller . He paused when he got outside the door -- shook his head -- walked on -- stopped -- snuffed the candle -- shook his head again -- and finally proceeded slowly to his chamber , apparently buried in the profoundest meditation . CHAPTER XXIII . IN WHICH MR . SAMUEL WELLER BEGINS TO DEVOTE HIS ENERGIES TO THE RETURN MATCH BETWEEN HIMSELF AND MR . TROTTER In a small room in the vicinity of the stableyard , betimes in the morning , which was ushered in by Mr. Pickwick ’s adventure with the middle -- aged lady in the yellow curl - papers , sat Mr. Weller , senior , preparing himself for his journey to London . He was sitting in an excellent attitude for having his portrait taken ; and here it is . It is very possible that at some earlier period of his career , Mr. Weller ’s profile might have presented a bold and determined outline . His face , however , had expanded under the influence of good living , and a disposition remarkable for resignation ; and its bold , fleshy curves had so far extended beyond the limits originally assigned them , that unless you took a full view of his countenance in front , it was difficult to distinguish more than the extreme tip of a very rubicund nose . His chin , from the same cause , had acquired the grave and imposing form which is generally described by prefixing the word ‘
148772	149074	149082	149083	the father	10481	’ to that expressive feature ; and his complexion exhibited that peculiarly mottled combination of colours which is only to be seen in gentlemen of his profession , and in underdone roast beef . Round his neck he wore a crimson travelling - shawl , which merged into his chin by such imperceptible gradations , that it was difficult to distinguish the folds of the one , from the folds of the other . Over this , he mounted a long waistcoat of a broad pink - striped pattern , and over that again , a wide- skirted green coat , ornamented with large brass buttons , whereof the two which garnished the waist , were so far apart , that no man had ever beheld them both at the same time . His hair , which was short , sleek , and black , was just visible beneath the capacious brim of a low - crowned brown hat . His legs were encased in knee - cord breeches , and painted top- boots ; and a copper watch - chain , terminating in one seal , and a key of the same material , dangled loosely from his capacious waistband . We have said that Mr. Weller was engaged in preparing for his journey to London -- he was taking sustenance , in fact . On the table before him , stood a pot of ale , a cold round of beef , and a very respectable - looking loaf , to each of which he distributed his favours in turn , with the most rigid impartiality . He had just cut a mighty slice from the latter , when the footsteps of somebody entering the room , caused him to raise his head ; and he beheld his son . ‘
149076	149080	149082	149083	the father	10481	’ , Sammy ! ’
149111	149116	149085	149086	The son	12513	‘ Wery good power o ’
149121	149145	149119	149119	Sammy	356	’ said Mr. Weller the elder , looking into the pot , when his first - born had set it down half empty . ‘
149149	149167	149174	149174	I	0	’ made an uncommon fine oyster , Sammy , if you ’d been born in that station o ’
149170	149171	149174	149174	I	0	’ ‘

149192	149206	149207	149207	I	0	’ replied Sam applying himself to the cold beef , with considerable vigour . ‘
149208	149214	149216	149217	the elder	12538	’m wery sorry , Sammy , ’
149238	149240	149241	149241	wery	4555	‘ I ’m

149293	149296	149313	149313	Sammy	356	‘ Always exceptin ’
149306	149310	149311	149311	Widders	492	’ said Sam . ‘
149315	149324	149313	149313	Sammy	356	’ replied Mr. Weller , slightly changing colour . ‘
149327	149348	149325	149325	Widders	492	‘ ceptions to ev’ry rule . I have heerd how many ordinary women one widder ’s equal to in pint o ’

149376	149384	149386	149386	Sam	356	‘ Well ; that ’s pretty well , ’
149388	149391	149386	149386	Sam	356	‘ Besides , ’
149401	149459	149393	149394	Mr. Weller	356	‘ that ’s a wery different thing . You know what the counsel said , Sammy , as defended the gen’l’m’n as beat his wife with the poker , venever he got jolly . “ And arter all , my Lord , ” says he , “ it ’s a amiable weakness . ” So I says respectin ’
149478	149479	149466	149466	you	356	’ ‘
149484	149491	149493	149493	Sam	356	’ know’d better , I know , ’
149495	149499	149493	149493	Sam	356	‘ Ought to ha ’
149503	149515	149483	149483	ha	4556	’ repeated Mr. Weller , striking the table with his fist . ‘
149519	149529	149483	149483	ha	4556	’ know’d better ! why , I know a young ‘
149557	149574	149483	149483	ha	4556	’ scorned to be let in , in such a vay ; scorned it , Sammy . ’
149600	149612	149614	149614	Sam	356	‘ Well , it ’s no use talking about it now , ’
149616	149666	149614	149614	Sam	356	‘ It ’s over , and ca n’t be helped , and that ’s one consolation , as they always says in Turkey , ven they cuts the wrong man ’s head off . It ’s my innings now , gov’nor , and as soon as I catches hold o ’
149668	149677	149682	149682	I	0	‘ ere Trotter , I ’ll have a good ‘
149680	149681	149682	149682	I	0	’ ‘
149694	149699	149689	149689	I	0	’ returned Mr. Weller . ‘
149724	149768	149772	149772	Sammy	356	’ In honour of this toast Mr. Weller imbibed at a draught , at least two - thirds of a newly - arrived pint , and handed it over to his son , to dispose of the remainder , which he instantaneously did . ‘
149774	149797	149772	149772	Sammy	356	’ said Mr. Weller , consulting a large double - faced silver watch that hung at the end of the copper chain . ‘
149844	149870	149871	149871	I	0	’ At this parental and professional joke , Mr. Weller , junior , smiled a filial smile . His revered parent continued in a solemn tone-- ‘
149872	149905	149871	149871	I	0	’m a - goin’ to leave you , Samivel , my boy , and there ’s no telling ven I shall see you again . Your mother - in - law may ha ’
149928	149934	149935	149937	the Bell Savage	4563	’ the celebrated Mr. Veller o ’
149967	149969	149971	149971	I	0	’ breedin ’
150009	150020	150021	150021	anybody	851	’ fifty , and feels disposed to go a - marryin ’
150084	150608	150067	150067	Samivel	493	’ With these affecting words , Mr. Weller looked steadfastly on his son , and turning slowly upon his heel , disappeared from his sight . In the contemplative mood which these words had awakened , Mr. Samuel Weller walked forth from the Great White Horse when his father had left him ; and bending his steps towards St. Clement ’s Church , endeavoured to dissipate his melancholy , by strolling among its ancient precincts . He had loitered about , for some time , when he found himself in a retired spot -- a kind of courtyard of venerable appearance -- which he discovered had no other outlet than the turning by which he had entered . He was about retracing his steps , when he was suddenly transfixed to the spot by a sudden appearance ; and the mode and manner of this appearance , we now proceed to relate . Mr. Samuel Weller had been staring up at the old brick houses now and then , in his deep abstraction , bestowing a wink upon some healthy- looking servant girl as she drew up a blind , or threw open a bedroom window , when the green gate of a garden at the bottom of the yard opened , and a man having emerged therefrom , closed the green gate very carefully after him , and walked briskly towards the very spot where Mr. Weller was standing . Now , taking this , as an isolated fact , unaccompanied by any attendant circumstances , there was nothing very extraordinary in it ; because in many parts of the world men do come out of gardens , close green gates after them , and even walk briskly away , without attracting any particular share of public observation . It is clear , therefore , that there must have been something in the man , or in his manner , or both , to attract Mr. Weller ’s particular notice . Whether there was , or not , we must leave the reader to determine , when we have faithfully recorded the behaviour of the individual in question . When the man had shut the green gate after him , he walked , as we have said twice already , with a brisk pace up the courtyard ; but he no sooner caught sight of Mr. Weller than he faltered , and stopped , as if uncertain , for the moment , what course to adopt . As the green gate was closed behind him , and there was no other outlet but the one in front , however , he was not long in perceiving that he must pass Mr. Samuel Weller to get away . He therefore resumed his brisk pace , and advanced , staring straight before him . The most extraordinary thing about the man was , that he was contorting his face into the most fearful and astonishing grimaces that ever were beheld . Nature ’s handiwork never was disguised with such extraordinary artificial carving , as the man had overlaid his countenance with in one moment . ‘
150611	150623	150067	150067	Samivel	493	’ said Mr. Weller to himself , as the man approached . ‘
150632	150638	150641	150642	the man	835	’ swore it was him . ’
150659	150667	150645	150645	his	835	‘ I could take my oath to that ‘
150675	150680	150645	150645	his	835	’ said Mr. Weller ; ‘
150692	150757	150758	150758	Hollo	303	’ As Mr. Weller said this , the man ’s features assumed an unearthly twinge , perfectly hideous . He was obliged to pass very near Sam , however , and the scrutinising glance of that gentleman enabled him to detect , under all these appalling twists of feature , something too like the small eyes of Mr. Job Trotter to be easily mistaken . ‘
150763	150772	150773	150773	Hollo	303	’ shouted Sam fiercely . The stranger stopped . ‘
150775	150835	150836	150836	Hollo	303	’ repeated Sam , still more gruffly . The man with the horrible face looked , with the greatest surprise , up the court , and down the court , and in at the windows of the houses-- everywhere but at Sam Weller -- and took another step forward , when he was brought to again by another shout . ‘
150841	150882	150836	150836	Hollo	303	’ said Sam , for the third time . There was no pretending to mistake where the voice came from now , so the stranger , having no other resource , at last looked Sam Weller full in the face . ‘
150891	150895	150888	150889	Job Trotter	419	’ said Sam . ‘
150900	150902	150888	150889	Job Trotter	419	’ that ‘

151004	151007	151009	151009	Sam	356	‘ Ah , ’
151011	151013	151009	151009	Sam	356	‘ You ’re
151024	151025	151022	151022	you	419	’ ‘
151028	151033	151036	151037	Mr. Walker	417	’ exclaimed Job Trotter ; ‘
151072	151109	151068	151068	I	0	’ And with these words , Mr. Trotter burst into a regular inundation of tears , and , flinging his arms around those of Mr. Weller , embraced him closely , in an ecstasy of joy . ‘
151113	151136	151068	151068	I	0	’ cried Sam , indignant at this process , and vainly endeavouring to extricate himself from the grasp of his enthusiastic acquaintance . ‘
151156	151157	151146	151146	you	417	’ ‘
151167	151186	151159	151159	I	0	’ replied Job Trotter , gradually releasing Mr. Weller , as the first symptoms of his pugnacity disappeared . ‘
151197	151198	151189	151190	Mr. Walker	417	’ ‘
151202	151206	151189	151190	Mr. Walker	417	’ echoed Sam , ‘
151229	151248	151220	151220	you	417	’ Mr. Trotter made no reply ; for the little pink pocket - handkerchief was in full force . ‘
151265	151275	151251	151251	you	417	’ repeated Mr. Weller , in a threatening manner . ‘
151278	151290	151251	151251	you	417	’ said Mr. Trotter , with a look of virtuous surprise . ‘

151400	151413	151398	151398	Sir	9716	’ replied Mr. Trotter , without moving a muscle of his face . ‘
151421	151447	151418	151419	Mr. Weller	356	’ Sam eyed his companion for a few seconds , and then , as if actuated by a sudden impulse , complied with his request . ‘
151450	151460	151418	151419	Mr. Weller	356	’ said Job Trotter , as they walked away , ‘
151494	151554	151492	151492	Sir	9716	’ There was a momentary look of deep slyness in Job Trotter ’s eye , as he said this , which ran a thrill through Mr. Weller ’s clenched fist , as he burned with a desire to make a demonstration on his ribs . Sam constrained himself , however , and replied that his master was extremely well . ‘
151562	151567	151569	151569	he	4580	’ replied Mr. Trotter ; ‘
151572	151573	151569	151569	he	4580	’ ‘
151577	151586	151591	151591	he	4580	’ asked Sam , by way of reply . ‘
151612	151613	151604	151604	he	4580	’ ‘
151618	151622	151604	151604	he	4580	’ said Sam . ‘
151629	151630	151604	151604	he	4580	’ ‘
151637	151641	151569	151569	he	4580	’ said Sam . ‘
151651	151667	151569	151569	he	4580	’ replied Job Trotter , with the same sly look which Sam had noticed before ; ‘
151675	151676	151569	151569	he	4580	’ ‘
151685	151694	151569	151569	he	4580	’ said Sam , eyeing his companion closely . ‘
151704	151716	151569	151569	he	4580	’ replied Job , with a quickness very unusual to him , ‘
151720	151721	151724	151724	you	4580	’ ‘
151730	151739	151724	151724	you	4580	’ asked Sam , with a sharp glance . ‘
151749	151750	151724	151724	you	4580	’ ‘
151756	151760	151753	151754	Mr. Weller	356	’ replied Job , ‘
151798	151799	151789	151789	You	356	’ ‘
151804	151810	151789	151789	You	356	’ said Sam , impatiently . ‘

151820	151843	151811	151811	I	0	’ replied Job , speaking with great precision , and in the low tone of a man who communicates an important secret ; ‘
151862	151863	151857	151860	a good many servants	4592	’ ‘
151875	151879	151857	151860	a good many servants	4592	’ interposed Sam . ‘
151882	151887	151891	151891	them	4591	’ continued Mr. Trotter , ‘
151932	151935	151929	151929	you	356	’ Yes . ’
151936	152043	152058	152058	Sam	356	‘ Yes , Mr. Weller . Well , Sir , I met her at a chapel that I go to ; a very neat little chapel in this town , Mr. Weller , where they sing the number four collection of hymns , which I generally carry about with me , in a little book , which you may perhaps have seen in my hand -- and I got a little intimate with her , Mr. Weller , and from that , an acquaintance sprung up between us , and I may venture to say , Mr. Weller , that I am to be the chandler . ’
152044	152056	152058	152058	Sam	356	‘ Ah , and a wery amiable chandler you ’ll make , ’
152070	152080	152082	152082	Job	419	‘ The great advantage of this , Mr. Weller , ’
152093	152139	152090	152090	he	419	‘ will be , that I shall be able to leave my present disgraceful service with that bad man , and to devote myself to a better and more virtuous life ; more like the way in which I was brought up , Mr. Weller . ’
152140	152144	152090	152090	he	419	‘ You must ha ’
152151	152155	152084	152084	his	419	’ said Sam . ‘
152165	152192	152160	152161	Mr. Weller	356	’ replied Job . At the recollection of the purity of his youthful days , Mr. Trotter pulled forth the pink handkerchief , and wept copiously . ‘
152196	152209	152211	152211	Sam	356	’ been an uncommon nice boy , to go to school vith , ’
152213	152219	152221	152221	Job	419	‘ I was , sir , ’
152228	152237	152221	152221	Job	419	‘ I was the idol of the place . ’
152238	152241	152243	152243	Sam	356	‘ Ah , ’
152245	152259	152243	152243	Sam	356	‘ I do n’t wonder at it . What a comfort you must ha ’
152266	152299	152243	152243	Sam	356	’ At these words , Mr. Job Trotter inserted an end of the pink handkerchief into the corner of each eye , one after the other , and began to weep copiously . ‘
152308	152314	152305	152306	the man	835	’ said Sam , indignantly . ‘
152333	152336	152305	152306	the man	835	’ willainy ? ’
152337	152349	152351	152351	Job	419	‘ I can not keep my feelings down , Mr. Weller , ’
152358	152428	152351	152351	Job	419	‘ To think that my master should have suspected the conversation I had with yours , and so dragged me away in a post - chaise , and after persuading the sweet young lady to say she knew nothing of him , and bribing the school - mistress to do the same , deserted her for a better speculation ! Oh ! Mr. Weller , it makes me shudder . ’
152429	152440	152442	152443	Mr. Weller	356	‘ Oh , that was the vay , was it ? ’
152445	152452	152454	152454	Job	419	‘ To be sure it was , ’
152456	152459	152461	152461	Sam	356	‘ Vell , ’
152472	152481	152461	152461	Sam	356	‘ I vant to have a little bit o ’

152517	152525	152527	152527	Job	419	‘ I shall be sure to come , ’
152529	152536	152538	152538	Sam	356	‘ Yes , you ’d better , ’
152546	152554	152538	152538	Sam	356	‘ or else I shall perhaps be askin ’

152591	152610	152580	152580	I	0	’ said Mr. Trotter ; and wringing Sam ’s hand with the utmost fervour , he walked away . ‘
152620	152628	152614	152615	Job Trotter	419	’ said Sam , looking after him , ‘
152646	152679	152641	152641	I	0	’ Having uttered this soliloquy , and looked after Job till he was to be seen no more , Mr. Weller made the best of his way to his master ’s bedroom . ‘
152688	152692	152686	152686	Sir	9716	’ said Sam . ‘
152700	152705	152698	152698	Sam	356	’ inquired Mr. Pickwick . ‘
152709	152715	152717	152717	Sam	240	‘ em out , Sir , ’
152719	152724	152717	152717	Sam	240	‘ Found out who ? ’

152743	152744	152733	152741	the melan - cholly chap with the black hair	4604	’ ‘
152749	152759	152747	152747	Sam	240	’ said Mr. Pickwick , with the greatest energy . ‘
152770	152771	152764	152764	Sam	240	’ ‘
152776	152803	152764	152764	Sam	240	’ replied Mr. Weller ; and as he assisted Mr. Pickwick to dress , he detailed the plan of action on which he proposed to enter . ‘
152814	152819	152812	152812	Sam	240	’ inquired Mr. Pickwick . ‘
152827	152953	152825	152825	Sir	9716	’ replied Sam . Whether it was done in good time , or not , will be seen hereafter . CHAPTER XXIV . WHEREIN MR . PETER MAGNUS GROWS JEALOUS , AND THE MIDDLE- AGED LADY APPREHENSIVE , WHICH BRINGS THE PICKWICKIANS WITHIN THE GRASP OF THE LAW When Mr. Pickwick descended to the room in which he and Mr. Peter Magnus had spent the preceding evening , he found that gentleman with the major part of the contents of the two bags , the leathern hat - box , and the brown - paper parcel , displaying to all possible advantage on his person , while he himself was pacing up and down the room in a state of the utmost excitement and agitation . ‘
152960	152966	152958	152958	Sir	9716	’ said Mr. Peter Magnus . ‘
152976	152977	152969	152969	you	9716	’ ‘
152982	153001	152969	152969	you	9716	’ replied Mr. Pickwick , surveying the garments of Mr. Peter Magnus with a good - natured smile . ‘
153010	153015	153004	153004	I	0	’ said Mr. Magnus . ‘
153028	153029	153031	153031	you	9716	’ ‘
153033	153038	153040	153041	the waiter	9785	’ said Mr. Pickwick . ‘
153066	153067	153047	153047	she	9785	’ ‘
153073	153078	153047	153047	she	9785	’ said Mr. Pickwick . ‘
153086	153091	153047	153047	she	9785	’ replied Mr. Magnus , ‘
153106	153107	153101	153102	Mr. Pickwick	240	’ ‘
153117	153122	153123	153123	I	0	’ observed Mr. Pickwick . ‘
153130	153136	153123	153123	I	0	’ said Mr. Peter Magnus . ‘
153215	153216	153212	153213	Mr. Pickwick	240	’ ‘
153224	153229	153212	153213	Mr. Pickwick	240	’ replied Mr. Pickwick . ‘
153240	153312	153317	153317	he	4620	’ Down they sat to breakfast , but it was evident , notwithstanding the boasting of Mr. Peter Magnus , that he laboured under a very considerable degree of nervousness , of which loss of appetite , a propensity to upset the tea - things , a spectral attempt at drollery , and an irresistible inclination to look at the clock , every other second , were among the principal symptoms . ‘
153319	153332	153317	153317	he	4620	’ tittered Mr. Magnus , affecting cheerfulness , and gasping with agitation . ‘
153348	153349	153346	153346	Sir	9716	’ ‘
153353	153364	153346	153346	Sir	9716	’ replied Mr. Pickwick . There was a brief pause . ‘
153386	153391	153375	153375	you	240	’ said Mr. Magnus . ‘
153396	153401	153375	153375	you	240	’ said Mr. Pickwick . ‘
153404	153405	153375	153375	you	240	’ ‘
153408	153417	153375	153375	you	240	’ said Mr. Pickwick , with great energy , ‘
153420	153421	153375	153375	you	240	’ ‘
153436	153441	153422	153422	You	0	’ said Mr. Magnus . ‘
153444	153449	153450	153450	I	0	’ said Mr. Pickwick , ‘
153489	153490	153491	153491	I	0	’ ‘
153506	153530	153504	153504	Sir	9716	’ said Mr. Magnus , taking another look at the clock , the hand of which was verging on the five minutes past . ‘
153535	153562	153533	153533	sir	9716	’ said Mr. Pickwick , with the profound solemnity with which that great man could , when he pleased , render his remarks so deeply impressive . ‘
153594	153595	153584	153584	Sir	9716	’ ‘
153599	153604	153584	153584	Sir	9716	’ said Mr. Magnus . ‘
153616	153621	153584	153584	Sir	9716	’ resumed Mr. Pickwick ; ‘
153698	153699	153688	153688	I	0	’ ‘
153705	153710	153688	153688	I	0	’ said Mr. Magnus ; ‘

153727	153783	153725	153725	Sir	9716	’ continued Mr. Pickwick , growing warmer as the subject presented itself in more glowing colours before him--‘I should then , Sir , come to the plain and simple question , “ Will you have me ? ” I think I am justified in assuming that upon this , she would turn away her head . ’
153784	153794	153796	153797	Mr. Magnus	488	‘ You think that may be taken for granted ? ’
153799	153818	153796	153797	Mr. Magnus	488	‘ because , if she did not do that at the right place , it would be embarrassing . ’
153819	153825	153827	153828	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I think she would , ’
153830	153945	153827	153828	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Upon this , sir , I should squeeze her hand , and I think -- I think , Mr. Magnus -- that after I had done that , supposing there was no refusal , I should gently draw away the handkerchief , which my slight knowledge of human nature leads me to suppose the lady would be applying to her eyes at the moment , and steal a respectful kiss . I think I should kiss her , Mr. Magnus ; and at this particular point , I am decidedly of opinion that if the lady were going to take me at all , she would murmur into my ears a bashful acceptance . ’
154087	154101	154103	154104	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ My friends , the gentleman I was speaking of -- Mr. Magnus , ’
154106	154112	154114	154115	Mr. Magnus	488	‘ Your servant , gentlemen , ’
154125	154140	154142	154142	he	488	‘ Mr. Pickwick , allow me to speak to you one moment , sir . ’
154167	154183	154146	154147	Mr. Magnus	488	‘ Congratulate me , Mr. Pickwick ; I followed your advice to the very letter . ’
154184	154194	154196	154197	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ And it was all correct , was it ? ’
154199	154212	154214	154215	Mr. Magnus	488	‘ It was , Sir . Could not possibly have been better , ’
154217	154225	154214	154215	Mr. Magnus	488	‘ Mr. Pickwick , she is mine . ’
154226	154236	154238	154239	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I congratulate you , with all my heart , ’
154250	154258	154260	154261	Mr. Magnus	488	‘ You must see her . Sir , ’
154263	154279	154260	154261	Mr. Magnus	488	‘ this way , if you please . Excuse us for one instant , gentlemen . ’
154311	154315	154296	154296	He	488	‘ Come in , ’
154326	154330	154332	154333	Mr. Magnus	488	‘ Miss Witherfield , ’
154335	154361	154332	154333	Mr. Magnus	488	‘ allow me to introduce my very particular friend , Mr. Pickwick . Mr. Pickwick , I beg to make you known to Miss Witherfield . ’
154566	154570	154572	154573	Mr. Magnus	488	‘ Mr. Pickwick ! ’
154579	154598	154600	154601	Mr. Magnus	488	‘ what is the meaning of this , Sir ? What is the meaning of it , Sir ? ’
154612	154615	154617	154618	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Sir , ’
154640	154647	154600	154601	Mr. Magnus	488	‘ I decline answering that question . ’
154648	154655	154657	154658	Mr. Magnus	488	‘ You decline it , Sir ? ’
154660	154666	154668	154669	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I do , Sir , ’
154671	154697	154668	154669	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I object to say anything which may compromise that lady , or awaken unpleasant recollections in her breast , without her consent and permission . ’
154698	154702	154704	154706	Mr. Peter Magnus	488	‘ Miss Witherfield , ’
154708	154715	154704	154706	Mr. Peter Magnus	488	‘ do you know this person ? ’
154716	154720	154722	154726	the middle - aged lady	12942	‘ Know him ! ’
154730	154743	154745	154746	Mr. Magnus	488	‘ Yes , know him , ma’am ; I said know him , ’
154751	154757	154759	154763	the middle - aged lady	12942	‘ I have seen him , ’
154765	154768	154770	154771	Mr. Magnus	488	‘ Where ? ’
154773	154776	154770	154771	Mr. Magnus	488	‘ where ? ’
154777	154780	154782	154786	the middle - aged lady	12942	‘ That , ’
154804	154805	154782	154786	the middle - aged lady	12942	’ ‘

154883	154898	154879	154881	Cruel Mr. Magnus	500	’ said the middle - aged lady ; here she wept very copiously indeed . ‘
154907	154912	154905	154905	sir	9716	’ interposed Mr. Pickwick ; ‘

155034	155075	154988	154988	Sir	9716	’ Here Mr. Peter Magnus indulged in a prolonged sneer ; and taking off his green spectacles-- which he probably found superfluous in his fit of jealousy -- rolled his little eyes about , in a manner frightful to behold . ‘
155078	155093	154988	154988	Sir	9716	’ said Mr. Magnus ; and then he repeated the sneer with increased effect . ‘
155102	155103	155100	155100	Sir	9716	’ ‘
155107	155112	155100	155100	Sir	9716	’ said Mr. Pickwick . ‘
155118	155130	155116	155116	sir	9716	’ replied Mr. Magnus , striding up and down the room . ‘
155134	155145	155116	155116	sir	9716	’ There must be something very comprehensive in this phrase of ‘
155149	155189	155116	155116	sir	9716	’ for we do not recollect to have ever witnessed a quarrel in the street , at a theatre , public room , or elsewhere , in which it has not been the standard reply to all belligerent inquiries . ‘
155202	155219	155200	155200	sir	9716	’ Did I offer to say anything to the young woman , sir?’--‘Never mind , sir . ’
155236	155255	155234	155234	sir	9716	’ It is observable , too , that there would appear to be some hidden taunt in this universal ‘
155259	155335	155336	155336	Tupman	244	’ which rouses more indignation in the bosom of the individual addressed , than the most lavish abuse could possibly awaken . We do not mean to assert that the application of this brevity to himself , struck exactly that indignation to Mr. Pickwick ’s soul , which it would infallibly have roused in a vulgar breast . We merely record the fact that Mr. Pickwick opened the room door , and abruptly called out , ‘
155341	155356	155357	155357	Tupman	244	’ Mr. Tupman immediately presented himself , with a look of very considerable surprise . ‘
155359	155364	155336	155336	Tupman	244	’ said Mr. Pickwick , ‘
155453	156318	156319	156319	Muzzle	503	’ As Mr. Pickwick said this , he looked encyclopedias at Mr. Peter Magnus . Mr. Pickwick ’s upright and honourable bearing , coupled with that force and energy of speech which so eminently distinguished him , would have carried conviction to any reasonable mind ; but , unfortunately , at that particular moment , the mind of Mr. Peter Magnus was in anything but reasonable order . Consequently , instead of receiving Mr. Pickwick ’s explanation as he ought to have done , he forthwith proceeded to work himself into a red - hot , scorching , consuming passion , and to talk about what was due to his own feelings , and all that sort of thing ; adding force to his declamation by striding to and fro , and pulling his hair-- amusements which he would vary occasionally , by shaking his fist in Mr. Pickwick ’s philanthropic countenance . Mr. Pickwick , in his turn , conscious of his own innocence and rectitude , and irritated by having unfortunately involved the middle - aged lady in such an unpleasant affair , was not so quietly disposed as was his wo nt . The consequence was , that words ran high , and voices higher ; and at length Mr. Magnus told Mr. Pickwick he should hear from him ; to which Mr. Pickwick replied , with laudable politeness , that the sooner he heard from him the better ; whereupon the middle - aged lady rushed in terror from the room , out of which Mr. Tupman dragged Mr. Pickwick , leaving Mr. Peter Magnus to himself and meditation . If the middle - aged lady had mingled much with the busy world , or had profited at all by the manners and customs of those who make the laws and set the fashions , she would have known that this sort of ferocity is the most harmless thing in nature ; but as she had lived for the most part in the country , and never read the parliamentary debates , she was little versed in these particular refinements of civilised life . Accordingly , when she had gained her bedchamber , bolted herself in , and began to meditate on the scene she had just witnessed , the most terrific pictures of slaughter and destruction presented themselves to her imagination ; among which , a full - length portrait of Mr. Peter Magnus borne home by four men , with the embellishment of a whole barrelful of bullets in his left side , was among the very least . The more the middle- aged lady meditated , the more terrified she became ; and at length she determined to repair to the house of the principal magistrate of the town , and request him to secure the persons of Mr. Pickwick and Mr. Tupman without delay . To this decision the middle - aged lady was impelled by a variety of considerations , the chief of which was the incontestable proof it would afford of her devotion to Mr. Peter Magnus , and her anxiety for his safety . She was too well acquainted with his jealous temperament to venture the slightest allusion to the real cause of her agitation on beholding Mr. Pickwick ; and she trusted to her own influence and power of persuasion with the little man , to quell his boisterous jealousy , supposing that Mr. Pickwick were removed , and no fresh quarrel could arise . Filled with these reflections , the middle - aged lady arrayed herself in her bonnet and shawl , and repaired to the mayor ’s dwelling straightway . Now George Nupkins , Esquire , the principal magistrate aforesaid , was as grand a personage as the fastest walker would find out , between sunrise and sunset , on the twenty - first of June , which being , according to the almanacs , the longest day in the whole year , would naturally afford him the longest period for his search . On this particular morning , Mr. Nupkins was in a state of the utmost excitement and irritation , for there had been a rebellion in the town ; all the day - scholars at the largest day - school had conspired to break the windows of an obnoxious apple - seller , and had hooted the beadle and pelted the constabulary -- an elderly gentleman in top - boots , who had been called out to repress the tumult , and who had been a peace - officer , man and boy , for half a century at least . And Mr. Nupkins was sitting in his easy - chair , frowning with majesty , and boiling with rage , when a lady was announced on pressing , private , and particular business . Mr. Nupkins looked calmly terrible , and commanded that the lady should be shown in ; which command , like all the mandates of emperors , and magistrates , and other great potentates of the earth , was forthwith obeyed ; and Miss Witherfield , interestingly agitated , was ushered in accordingly . ‘
156321	156340	156319	156319	Muzzle	503	’ said the magistrate . Muzzle was an undersized footman , with a long body and short legs . ‘

156411	156418	156408	156409	the magistrate	13136	‘ Compose your feelings , ma’am . ’

156454	156469	156471	156472	Miss Witherfield	498	‘ It is very distressing to me , Sir , to give this information , ’
156474	156487	156471	156472	Miss Witherfield	498	‘ but I fear a duel is going to be fought here . ’

156519	156530	156495	156496	the magistrate	13136	’ said the magistrate , perfectly aghast at the notion . ‘

156714	156720	156721	156721	Muzzle	503	’ said the astounded magistrate . ‘

156748	156777	156778	156779	Mr. Jinks	505	’ Muzzle retired ; and a pale , sharp - nosed , half - fed , shabbily - clad clerk , of middle age , entered the room . ‘

156863	156868	156869	156869	you	505	’ said the magistrate , ‘
156870	156874	156875	156876	Mr. Jinks	505	’re a fool . ’
156892	156924	156926	156927	the magistrate	13136	‘ You may see something very comical in this information , Sir -- but I can tell you this , Mr. Jinks , that you have very little to laugh at , ’
156979	156992	156994	156995	the magistrate	13136	‘ This man , Pickwick , is the principal , I understand ? ’
157003	157007	157009	157013	the middle - aged lady	12942	‘ He is , ’
157015	157029	157009	157013	the middle - aged lady	12942	‘ And the other rioter -- what ’s his name , Mr. Jinks ? ’
157030	157035	157009	157013	the middle - aged lady	12942	‘ Tupman , Sir . ’

157167	157212	157164	157164	him	506	’ The obsequious Muzzle retired , and presently returned , introducing the elderly gentleman in the top - boots , who was chiefly remarkable for a bottle - nose , a hoarse voice , a snuff - coloured surtout , and a wandering eye . ‘
157215	157220	157213	157213	Grummer	506	’ said the magistrate . ‘

157268	157281	157283	157284	the magistrate	13136	‘ Nothing but vigorous measures will do in these times , Grummer , ’
157291	157351	157283	157284	the magistrate	13136	‘ If the authority of the king ’s officers is set at naught , we must have the riot act read . If the civil power can not protect these windows , Grummer , the military must protect the civil power , and the windows too . I believe that is a maxim of the constitution , Mr. Jinks ? ’
157356	157360	157354	157354	sir	9716	’ said Jinks . ‘
157364	157373	157374	157374	Grummer	506	’ said the magistrate , signing the warrants . ‘
157412	157451	157410	157410	Grummer	506	’ Mr. Grummer intimated , by a retrospective shake of the head , that he should never forget it -- as indeed it was not likely he would , so long as it continued to be cited daily . ‘
157458	157463	157410	157410	Grummer	506	’ said the magistrate ; ‘

157551	157556	157549	157549	Sir	9716	’ replied Mr. Jinks . ‘
157560	157570	157534	157534	I	0	’ said the magistrate , drawing himself up proudly , ‘

157608	157609	157605	157606	your Worship	4702	’ ‘
157615	158024	157605	157606	your Worship	4702	’ Miss Witherfield retired , deeply impressed with the magistrate ’s learning and research ; Mr. Nupkins retired to lunch ; Mr. Jinks retired within himself -- that being the only retirement he had , except the sofa- bedstead in the small parlour which was occupied by his landlady ’s family in the daytime -- and Mr. Grummer retired , to wipe out , by his mode of discharging his present commission , the insult which had been fastened upon himself , and the other representative of his Majesty -- the beadle -- in the course of the morning . While these resolute and determined preparations for the conservation of the king ’s peace were pending , Mr. Pickwick and his friends , wholly unconscious of the mighty events in progress , had sat quietly down to dinner ; and very talkative and companionable they all were . Mr. Pickwick was in the very act of relating his adventure of the preceding night , to the great amusement of his followers , Mr. Tupman especially , when the door opened , and a somewhat forbidding countenance peeped into the room . The eyes in the forbidding countenance looked very earnestly at Mr. Pickwick , for several seconds , and were to all appearance satisfied with their investigation ; for the body to which the forbidding countenance belonged , slowly brought itself into the apartment , and presented the form of an elderly individual in top - boots -- not to keep the reader any longer in suspense , in short , the eyes were the wandering eyes of Mr. Grummer , and the body was the body of the same gentleman . Mr. Grummer ’s mode of proceeding was professional , but peculiar . His first act was to bolt the door on the inside ; his second , to polish his head and countenance very carefully with a cotton handkerchief ; his third , to place his hat , with the cotton handkerchief in it , on the nearest chair ; and his fourth , to produce from the breast - pocket of his coat a short truncheon , surmounted by a brazen crown , with which he beckoned to Mr. Pickwick with a grave and ghost - like air . Mr. Snodgrass was the first to break the astonished silence . He looked steadily at Mr. Grummer for a brief space , and then said emphatically , ‘
158037	158047	157605	157606	your Worship	4702	’ Mr. Grummer shook his head , and replied , ‘
158083	158094	158124	158124	Tupman	244	’ The Pickwickians gazed on each other with wondering eyes . ‘
158100	158120	158097	158098	Mr. Tupman	244	’ inquired Mr. Grummer . He had an intuitive perception of Mr. Pickwick ; he knew him at once . ‘
158126	158131	158124	158124	Tupman	244	’ said that gentleman . ‘
158137	158142	158132	158132	My	0	’ said Mr. Grummer . ‘
158145	158150	158132	158132	My	0	’ said Mr. Tupman . ‘
158153	158186	158188	158189	the king	13168	’ replied Mr. Grummer--‘Law , civil power , and exekative ; them ’s my titles ; here ’s my authority . Blank Tupman , blank Pickwick -- against the peace of our sufferin ’
158213	158214	158208	158208	Tupman	244	’ ‘
158223	158231	158208	158208	Tupman	244	’ said Mr. Tupman , starting up ; ‘
158236	158237	158208	158208	Tupman	244	’ ‘
158240	158260	158261	158261	Dubbley	509	’ said Mr. Grummer , retreating very expeditiously to the door , and opening it an inch or two , ‘
158263	158264	158261	158261	Dubbley	509	’ ‘
158267	158276	158261	158261	Dubbley	509	’ said a deep voice from the passage . ‘
158282	158330	158332	158335	the other specials outside	4731	’ At the word of command , a dirty - faced man , something over six feet high , and stout in proportion , squeezed himself through the half - open door ( making his face very red in the process ) , and entered the room . ‘
158339	158358	158332	158335	the other specials outside	4731	’ inquired Mr. Grummer . Mr. Dubbley , who was a man of few words , nodded assent . ‘
158369	158449	158367	158367	Dubbley	509	’ said Mr. Grummer . Mr. Dubbley did as he was desired ; and half a dozen men , each with a short truncheon and a brass crown , flocked into the room . Mr. Grummer pocketed his staff , and looked at Mr. Dubbley ; Mr. Dubbley pocketed his staff and looked at the division ; the division pocketed their staves and looked at Messrs. Tupman and Pickwick . Mr. Pickwick and his followers rose as one man . ‘
158462	158467	158332	158335	the other specials outside	4731	’ said Mr. Pickwick . ‘
158473	158478	158332	158335	the other specials outside	4731	’ said Mr. Tupman . ‘
158487	159446	158481	158481	you	4732	’ said Mr. Snodgrass . Mr. Winkle said nothing , but he fixed his eyes on Grummer , and bestowed a look upon him , which , if he had had any feeling , must have pierced his brain . As it was , however , it had no visible effect on him whatever . When the executive perceived that Mr. Pickwick and his friends were disposed to resist the authority of the law , they very significantly turned up their coat sleeves , as if knocking them down in the first instance , and taking them up afterwards , were a mere professional act which had only to be thought of to be done , as a matter of course . This demonstration was not lost upon Mr. Pickwick . He conferred a few moments with Mr. Tupman apart , and then signified his readiness to proceed to the mayor ’s residence , merely begging the parties then and there assembled , to take notice , that it was his firm intention to resent this monstrous invasion of his privileges as an Englishman , the instant he was at liberty ; whereat the parties then and there assembled laughed very heartily , with the single exception of Mr. Grummer , who seemed to consider that any slight cast upon the divine right of magistrates was a species of blasphemy not to be tolerated . But when Mr. Pickwick had signified his readiness to bow to the laws of his country , and just when the waiters , and hostlers , and chambermaids , and post - boys , who had anticipated a delightful commotion from his threatened obstinacy , began to turn away , disappointed and disgusted , a difficulty arose which had not been foreseen . With every sentiment of veneration for the constituted authorities , Mr. Pickwick resolutely protested against making his appearance in the public streets , surrounded and guarded by the officers of justice , like a common criminal . Mr. Grummer , in the then disturbed state of public feeling ( for it was half - holiday , and the boys had not yet gone home ) , as resolutely protested against walking on the opposite side of the way , and taking Mr. Pickwick ’s parole that he would go straight to the magistrate ’s ; and both Mr. Pickwick and Mr. Tupman as strenuously objected to the expense of a post - coach , which was the only respectable conveyance that could be obtained . The dispute ran high , and the dilemma lasted long ; and just as the executive were on the point of overcoming Mr. Pickwick ’s objection to walking to the magistrate ’s , by the trite expedient of carrying him thither , it was recollected that there stood in the inn yard , an old sedan - chair , which , having been originally built for a gouty gentleman with funded property , would hold Mr. Pickwick and Mr. Tupman , at least as conveniently as a modern post - chaise . The chair was hired , and brought into the hall ; Mr. Pickwick and Mr. Tupman squeezed themselves inside , and pulled down the blinds ; a couple of chairmen were speedily found ; and the procession started in grand order . The specials surrounded the body of the vehicle ; Mr. Grummer and Mr. Dubbley marched triumphantly in front ; Mr. Snodgrass and Mr. Winkle walked arm - in - arm behind ; and the unsoaped of Ipswich brought up the rear . The shopkeepers of the town , although they had a very indistinct notion of the nature of the offence , could not but be much edified and gratified by this spectacle . Here was the strong arm of the law , coming down with twenty gold - beater force , upon two offenders from the metropolis itself ; the mighty engine was directed by their own magistrate , and worked by their own officers ; and both the criminals , by their united efforts , were securely shut up , in the narrow compass of one sedan - chair . Many were the expressions of approval and admiration which greeted Mr. Grummer , as he headed the cavalcade , staff in hand ; loud and long were the shouts raised by the unsoaped ; and amidst these united testimonials of public approbation , the procession moved slowly and majestically along . Mr. Weller , habited in his morning jacket , with the black calico sleeves , was returning in a rather desponding state from an unsuccessful survey of the mysterious house with the green gate , when , raising his eyes , he beheld a crowd pouring down the street , surrounding an object which had very much the appearance of a sedan - chair . Willing to divert his thoughts from the failure of his enterprise , he stepped aside to see the crowd pass ; and finding that they were cheering away , very much to their own satisfaction , forthwith began ( by way of raising his spirits ) to cheer too , with all his might and main . Mr. Grummer passed , and Mr. Dubbley passed , and the sedan passed , and the bodyguard of specials passed , and Sam was still responding to the enthusiastic cheers of the mob , and waving his hat about as if he were in the very last extreme of the wildest joy ( though , of course , he had not the faintest idea of the matter in hand ) , when he was suddenly stopped by the unexpected appearance of Mr. Winkle and Mr. Snodgrass . ‘

159792	160238	160243	160243	IT	4741	’ said the outraged Mr. Grummer . By way of adding force to the command , he thrust the brass emblem of royalty into Sam ’s neckcloth with one hand , and seized Sam ’s collar with the other -- a compliment which Mr. Weller returned by knocking him down out of hand , having previously with the utmost consideration , knocked down a chairman for him to lie upon . Whether Mr. Winkle was seized with a temporary attack of that species of insanity which originates in a sense of injury , or animated by this display of Mr. Weller ’s valour , is uncertain ; but certain it is , that he no sooner saw Mr. Grummer fall than he made a terrific onslaught on a small boy who stood next him ; whereupon Mr. Snodgrass , in a truly Christian spirit , and in order that he might take no one unawares , announced in a very loud tone that he was going to begin , and proceeded to take off his coat with the utmost deliberation . He was immediately surrounded and secured ; and it is but common justice both to him and Mr. Winkle to say , that they did not make the slightest attempt to rescue either themselves or Mr. Weller ; who , after a most vigorous resistance , was overpowered by numbers and taken prisoner . The procession then reformed ; the chairmen resumed their stations ; and the march was re- commenced . Mr. Pickwick ’s indignation during the whole of this proceeding was beyond all bounds . He could just see Sam upsetting the specials , and flying about in every direction ; and that was all he could see , for the sedan doors would n’t open , and the blinds would n’t pull up . At length , with the assistance of Mr. Tupman , he managed to push open the roof ; and mounting on the seat , and steadying himself as well as he could , by placing his hand on that gentleman ’s shoulder , Mr. Pickwick proceeded to address the multitude ; to dwell upon the unjustifiable manner in which he had been treated ; and to call upon them to take notice that his servant had been first assaulted . In this order they reached the magistrate ’s house ; the chairmen trotting , the prisoners following , Mr. Pickwick oratorising , and the crowd shouting . CHAPTER XXV .

161184	161192	161194	161195	the magistrate	13136	‘ Who is this man , Grummer ? ’
161197	161207	161209	161209	Grummer	506	‘ Wery desp’rate ch’racter , your Wash - up , ’
161211	161236	161209	161209	Grummer	506	‘ He attempted to rescue the prisoners , and assaulted the officers ; so we took him into custody , and brought him here . ’
161237	161243	161245	161246	the magistrate	13136	‘ You did quite right , ’
161248	161256	161245	161246	the magistrate	13136	‘ He is evidently a desperate ruffian . ’
161257	161265	161267	161268	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ He is my servant , Sir , ’
161271	161282	161284	161285	Mr. Nupkins	502	‘ Oh ! he is your servant , is he ? ’
161287	161313	161284	161285	Mr. Nupkins	502	‘ A conspiracy to defeat the ends of justice , and murder its officers . Pickwick ’s servant . Put that down , Mr. Jinks . ’

161339	161349	161351	161352	Mr. Nupkins	502	‘ A very good name for the Newgate Calendar , ’

161393	161398	161390	161391	Mr. Jinks	505	’ said the magistrate . ‘
161406	161442	161403	161404	old feller	12001	’ said Sam . Here an unfortunate special laughed again , whereupon the magistrate threatened to commit him instantly . It is a dangerous thing to laugh at the wrong man , in these cases . ‘
161448	161453	161403	161404	old feller	12001	’ said the magistrate . ‘
161459	161463	161468	161469	Mr. Jinks	505	’ replied Sam . ‘
161471	161484	161468	161469	Mr. Jinks	505	’ said the magistrate , who was fast rising into a rage . ‘
161489	161493	161468	161469	Mr. Jinks	505	’ said Sam . ‘
161502	161507	161499	161500	Mr. Jinks	505	’ said the magistrate . ‘

161580	161604	161605	161605	Grummer	506	’ At this sally another special laughed , and then tried to look so supernaturally solemn , that the magistrate detected him immediately . ‘
161607	161616	161605	161605	Grummer	506	’ said Mr. Nupkins , reddening with passion , ‘
161644	161645	161638	161638	you	506	’ ‘
161656	161660	161646	161646	I	0	’ stammered Grummer . ‘

161763	161771	161773	161773	Grummer	506	‘ Horrid , your Wash - up , ’

161830	161835	161850	161851	the man	835	‘ Certainly , Sir . ’
161836	161848	161850	161851	the man	835	‘ I have n’t touched a drop of spirits this morning , ’
161863	161872	161874	161875	Mr. Nupkins	502	‘ How dare you tell me a falsehood ? ’
161877	161889	161874	161875	Mr. Nupkins	502	‘ Is n’t he drunk at this moment , Mr. Jinks ? ’

162043	162049	162051	162052	the magistrate	13136	‘ Now , Mr. Jinks , ’

162206	162218	162220	162221	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I beg your pardon , sir , for interrupting you , ’
162223	162266	162220	162221	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ but before you proceed to express , and act upon , any opinion you may have formed on the statements which have been made here , I must claim my right to be heard so far as I am personally concerned . ’

162336	162391	162333	162334	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ and I have no doubt , from the specimen I have had of the subordination preserved amongst them , that whatever you order , they will execute , Sir ; but I shall take the liberty , Sir , of claiming my right to be heard , until I am removed by force . ’

162536	162544	162508	162509	the magistrate	13136	‘ What do you want to say ? ’
162545	162548	162550	162551	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ First , ’
162566	162584	162563	162563	Nupkins	502	‘ first , I wish to know what I and my friend have been brought here for ? ’
162585	162591	162593	162594	the magistrate	13136	‘ Must I tell him ? ’
162598	162607	162609	162609	Jinks	505	‘ I think you had better , sir , ’
162614	162623	162625	162626	the magistrate	13136	‘ An information has been sworn before me , ’
162628	162664	162625	162626	the magistrate	13136	‘ that it is apprehended you are going to fight a duel , and that the other man , Tupman , is your aider and abettor in it . Therefore -- eh , Mr. Jinks ? ’
162665	162670	162625	162626	the magistrate	13136	‘ Certainly , sir . ’
162671	162692	162625	162626	the magistrate	13136	‘ Therefore , I call upon you both , to -- I think that ’s the course , Mr. Jinks ? ’
162693	162698	162625	162626	the magistrate	13136	‘ Certainly , Sir . ’
162699	162709	162711	162712	the magistrate	13136	‘ To -- to -- what , Mr. Jinks ? ’
162715	162722	162711	162712	the magistrate	13136	‘ To find bail , sir . ’
162723	162752	162625	162626	the magistrate	13136	‘ Yes . Therefore , I call upon you both -- as I was about to say when I was interrupted by my clerk -- to find bail . ’
162756	162761	162762	162762	I	0	’ whispered Mr. Jinks . ‘
162768	162773	162762	162762	I	0	’ said the magistrate . ‘
162778	162782	162783	162783	They	4827	’ whispered Jinks . ‘
162788	162793	162786	162786	townspeople	4828	’ said the magistrate . ‘
162798	162802	162762	162762	I	0	’ whispered Jinks , ‘
162809	162810	162811	162811	I	0	’ ‘
162821	162831	162833	162833	they	4829	’ said the magistrate aloud , with great dignity , ‘
162841	162842	162836	162836	householders	4829	’ ‘
162850	162868	162836	162836	householders	4829	’ said Mr. Pickwick , who , together with Mr. Tupman , was all amazement and indignation ; ‘
162898	162899	162900	162900	I	0	’ ‘
162904	162909	162900	162900	I	0	’ replied the magistrate , ‘
162920	162921	162917	162918	Mr. Jinks	505	’ ‘
162926	162927	162924	162924	Sir	9716	’ ‘
162935	163155	162929	162929	you	9716	’ inquired the magistrate . Mr. Pickwick had a great deal more to say , which he would no doubt have said , very little to his own advantage , or the magistrate ’s satisfaction , if he had not , the moment he ceased speaking , been pulled by the sleeve by Mr. Weller , with whom he was immediately engaged in so earnest a conversation , that he suffered the magistrate ’s inquiry to pass wholly unnoticed . Mr. Nupkins was not the man to ask a question of the kind twice over ; and so , with another preparatory cough , he proceeded , amidst the reverential and admiring silence of the constables , to pronounce his decision . He should fine Weller two pounds for the first assault , and three pounds for the second . He should fine Winkle two pounds , and Snodgrass one pound , besides requiring them to enter into their own recognisances to keep the peace towards all his Majesty ’s subjects , and especially towards his liege servant , Daniel Grummer . Pickwick and Tupman he had already held to bail . Immediately on the magistrate ceasing to speak , Mr. Pickwick , with a smile mantling on his again good - humoured countenance , stepped forward , and said-- ‘
163170	163185	163191	163192	the magistrate	13136	’ private conversation with him , on a matter of deep importance to himself ? ’
163186	163189	163191	163192	the magistrate	13136	‘ What ? ’
163200	163208	163210	163211	the magistrate	13136	‘ This is a most extraordinary request , ’
163213	163218	163210	163211	the magistrate	13136	‘ A private interview ? ’
163219	163224	163226	163227	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ A private interview , ’
163230	163258	163226	163227	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ only , as a part of the information which I wish to communicate is derived from my servant , I should wish him to be present . ’
163348	163360	163362	163363	Mr. Nupkins	502	‘ What do you think of this request , Mr. Jinks ? ’
163413	163417	163419	163420	the magistrate	13136	‘ Mr. Jinks , ’
163423	163429	163419	163420	the magistrate	13136	‘ you are an ass . ’
163569	163581	163583	163584	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I will come to the point at once , sir , ’
163586	163615	163583	163584	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ it affects yourself and your credit materially . I have every reason to believe , Sir , that you are harbouring in your house a gross impostor ! ’
163616	163619	163621	163621	Sam	240	‘ Two , ’
163623	163634	163621	163621	Sam	240	‘ Mulberry agin all natur , for tears and willainny ! ’

163643	163664	163640	163641	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ if I am to render myself intelligible to this gentleman , I must beg you to control your feelings . ’
163665	163671	163673	163674	Mr. Weller	356	‘ Wery sorry , Sir , ’
163676	163682	163673	163674	Mr. Weller	356	‘ but when I think o ’

163701	163708	163710	163711	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ In one word , Sir , ’
163713	163737	163739	163740	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ is my servant right in suspecting that a certain Captain Fitz - Marshall is in the habit of visiting here ? Because , ’
163757	163770	163743	163743	he	240	‘ because if he be , I know that person to be a-- ’
163771	163776	163778	163779	Mr. Nupkins	502	‘ Hush , hush , ’
163785	163794	163778	163779	Mr. Nupkins	502	‘ Know him to be what , Sir ? ’
163795	163834	163836	163839	the excited Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ An unprincipled adventurer -- a dishonourable character -- a man who preys upon society , and makes easily - deceived people his dupes , Sir ; his absurd , his foolish , his wretched dupes , Sir , ’
163841	163845	163847	163848	Mr. Nupkins	502	‘ Dear me , ’
163861	163866	163847	163848	Mr. Nupkins	502	‘ Dear me , Mr.-- ’

163874	163877	163879	163880	the magistrate	13136	‘ Pickwick , ’
163882	163905	163879	163880	the magistrate	13136	‘ dear me , Mr. Pickwick -- pray take a seat -- you can not mean this ? Captain Fitz - Marshall ! ’
163906	163914	163916	163916	Sam	240	‘ Do n’t call him a cap’en , ’
163918	163961	163916	163916	Sam	240	‘ nor Fitz - Marshall neither ; he ai n’t neither one nor t’other . He ’s a strolling actor , he is , and his name ’s Jingle ; and if ever there was a wolf in a mulberry suit , that ‘

163977	163991	163916	163916	Sam	240	’ said Mr. Pickwick , replying to the magistrate ’s look of amazement ; ‘
164010	164328	164002	164005	the person of whom	4857	’ Mr. Pickwick proceeded to pour into the horror - stricken ear of Mr. Nupkins , an abridged account of all Mr. Jingle ’s atrocities . He related how he had first met him ; how he had eloped with Miss Wardle ; how he had cheerfully resigned the lady for a pecuniary consideration ; how he had entrapped himself into a lady ’s boarding - school at midnight ; and how he ( Mr. Pickwick ) now felt it his duty to expose his assumption of his present name and rank . As the narrative proceeded , all the warm blood in the body of Mr. Nupkins tingled up into the very tips of his ears . He had picked up the captain at a neighbouring race - course . Charmed with his long list of aristocratic acquaintance , his extensive travel , and his fashionable demeanour , Mrs. Nupkins and Miss Nupkins had exhibited Captain Fitz- Marshall , and quoted Captain Fitz - Marshall , and hurled Captain Fitz- Marshall at the devoted heads of their select circle of acquaintance , until their bosom friends , Mrs. Porkenham and the Misses Porkenhams , and Mr. Sidney Porkenham , were ready to burst with jealousy and despair . And now , to hear , after all , that he was a needy adventurer , a strolling player , and if not a swindler , something so very like it , that it was hard to tell the difference ! Heavens ! what would the Porkenhams say ! What would be the triumph of Mr. Sidney Porkenham when he found that his addresses had been slighted for such a rival ! How should he , Nupkins , meet the eye of old Porkenham at the next quarter - sessions ! And what a handle would it be for the opposition magisterial party if the story got abroad ! ‘
164333	164348	164002	164005	the person of whom	4857	’ said Mr. Nupkins , brightening for a moment , after a long pause ; ‘

164398	164403	164383	164383	you	0	’ said Mr. Pickwick , ‘

164548	164558	164546	164546	Grummer	515	’ said the magistrate , in an awful voice . ‘
164564	164575	164559	164559	Your	515	’ replied Grummer , with the smile of a favourite . ‘
164582	164588	164580	164580	Sir	9716	’ said the magistrate sternly , ‘

164649	164659	164661	164662	the magistrate	13136	‘ Oh , you are confused , are you ? ’
164664	164673	164661	164662	the magistrate	13136	‘ Mr. Jinks , you observe this confusion ? ’
164674	164679	164681	164681	Jinks	505	‘ Certainly , Sir , ’
164683	164686	164688	164689	the magistrate	13136	‘ Now , ’
164691	164715	164688	164689	the magistrate	13136	‘ repeat your statement , Grummer , and again I warn you to be careful . Mr. Jinks , take his words down . ’
164992	164996	164998	164999	Miss Nupkins	520	‘ The idea ! ’
165015	165027	164998	164999	Miss Nupkins	520	‘ the idea of my being made such a fool of ! ’
165028	165040	165042	165043	Mrs. Nupkins	519	‘ Ah ! you may thank your papa , my dear , ’
165045	165087	165042	165043	Mrs. Nupkins	519	‘ how I have implored and begged that man to inquire into the captain ’s family connections ; how I have urged and entreated him to take some decisive step ! I am quite certain nobody would believe it -- quite . ’
165088	165094	165096	165097	Mr. Nupkins	502	‘ But , my dear , ’
165099	165113	165115	165116	Mrs. Nupkins	519	‘ Do n’t talk to me , you aggravating thing , do n’t ! ’

165189	165214	165172	165173	Mrs. Nupkins	519	‘ Did n’t I say that your papa would turn round and lay all this at my door ? Did n’t I say so ? ’

165236	165265	165267	165268	Mrs. Nupkins	519	‘ Is n’t it too much , when he has brought all this disgrace and ridicule upon us , to taunt me with being the cause of it ? ’
165270	165280	165282	165283	Miss Nupkins	520	‘ How can we ever show ourselves in society ! ’
165285	165293	165295	165296	Mrs. Nupkins	519	‘ How can we face the Porkenhams ? ’
165298	165303	165305	165306	Miss Nupkins	520	‘ Or the Griggs ! ’
165308	165313	165315	165316	Mrs. Nupkins	519	‘ Or the Slummintowkens ! ’
165318	165334	165315	165316	Mrs. Nupkins	519	‘ But what does your papa care ! What is it to _ him _ ! ’
165635	165642	165644	165645	Mr. Muzzle	503	‘ How de do , sir ? ’
165657	165693	165695	165695	Sam	356	‘ Why , no considerable change has taken place in the state of my system , since I see you cocked up behind your governor ’s chair in the parlour , a little vile ago , ’
165697	165710	165712	165713	Mr. Muzzle	503	‘ You will excuse my not taking more notice of you then , ’
165715	165743	165712	165713	Mr. Muzzle	503	‘ You see , master had n’t introduced us , then . Lord , how fond he is of you , Mr. Weller , to be sure ! ’

165751	165759	165749	165749	Sam	356	‘ what a pleasant chap he is ! ’

165770	165775	165777	165777	Sam	356	‘ So much humour , ’
165779	165787	165789	165790	Mr. Muzzle	503	‘ And such a man to speak , ’

165803	165806	165808	165808	Sam	356	‘ Wonderful , ’

166086	166091	166093	166094	Mr. Muzzle	503	‘ Oh , dreadful , ’
166096	166129	166093	166094	Mr. Muzzle	503	‘ but that is the worst of country service , Mr. Weller ; the juniors is always so very savage . This way , sir , if you please , this way . ’
166147	166150	166152	166153	Mr. Muzzle	503	‘ Mary , ’
166161	166183	166152	166153	Mr. Muzzle	503	‘ this is Mr. Weller ; a gentleman as master has sent down , to be made as comfortable as possible . ’

166564	166571	166573	166573	Mary	307	‘ For shame , Mr. Weller ! ’
166575	166584	166573	166573	Mary	307	‘ What ’s a shame , my dear ? ’

In the midst of all this jollity and conviviality , a loud ring was heard at the garden gate , to which the young gentleman who took his meals in the wash - house , immediately responded . Mr. Weller was in the height of his attentions to the pretty house - maid ; Mr. Muzzle was busy doing the honours of the table ; and the cook had just paused to laugh , in the very act of raising a huge morsel to her lips ; when the kitchen door opened , and in walked Mr. Job Trotter . We have said in walked Mr. Job Trotter , but the statement is not distinguished by our usual scrupulous adherence to fact . The door opened and Mr. Trotter appeared . He would have walked in , and was in the very act of doing so , indeed , when catching sight of Mr. Weller , he involuntarily shrank back a pace or two , and stood gazing on the unexpected scene before him , perfectly motionless with amazement and terror . ‘
166886	166895	166617	166617	me	0	’ said Sam , rising with great glee . ‘

166966	166974	166976	166976	Sam	356	‘ Well , here ’s a game ! ’

167070	167074	167067	167067	he	503	’ said Sam . ‘
167080	167084	167067	167067	he	503	’ said Muzzle . ‘
167100	167104	167067	167067	he	503	’ said Sam . ‘
167111	167147	167067	167067	he	503	’ Mr. Trotter suffered himself to be forced into a chair by the fireside . He cast his small eyes , first on Mr. Weller , and then on Mr. Muzzle , but said nothing . ‘
167152	167156	167067	167067	he	503	’ said Sam , ‘
167208	167209	167188	167190	a young gen’l’m’n	4920	’ ‘
167224	167230	167231	167232	The willin	4922	’ said that lady indignantly . ‘

167252	167257	167231	167232	The willin	4922	’ said the housemaid . ‘
167271	167284	167260	167260	I	0	’ said Mr. Muzzle solemnly , enraged at the last two allusions , ‘
167311	167341	167343	167344	Mr. Muzzle	503	’ shops with her , you injure me in one of the most delicatest points in which one man can injure another . Do you understand that , Sir ? ’
167382	167452	167453	167454	Mr. Muzzle	503	‘ It ’s very probable , sir , that you wo n’t be wanted upstairs for several minutes , Sir , because _ my _ master is at this moment particularly engaged in settling the hash of _ your _ master , Sir ; and therefore you ’ll have leisure , Sir , for a little private talk with me , Sir . Do you understand that , Sir ? ’
167468	167473	167475	167476	Mr. Muzzle	503	‘ Well , then , ’
167478	167480	167475	167476	Mr. Muzzle	503	‘ I ’m
167541	167726	167539	167539	Sir	9716	’ As Mr. Muzzle uttered these words , he took a step or two towards the door ; and , by way of saving time , began to pull off his coat as he walked along . Now , the cook no sooner heard the concluding words of this desperate challenge , and saw Mr. Muzzle about to put it into execution , than she uttered a loud and piercing shriek ; and rushing on Mr. Job Trotter , who rose from his chair on the instant , tore and buffeted his large flat face , with an energy peculiar to excited females , and twining her hands in his long black hair , tore therefrom about enough to make five or six dozen of the very largest - sized mourning - rings . Having accomplished this feat with all the ardour which her devoted love for Mr. Muzzle inspired , she staggered back ; and being a lady of very excitable and delicate feelings , she instantly fell under the dresser , and fainted away . At this moment , the bell rang . ‘
167735	167931	167732	167733	Job Trotter	419	’ said Sam ; and before Mr. Trotter could offer remonstrance or reply -- even before he had time to stanch the wounds inflicted by the insensible lady -- Sam seized one arm and Mr. Muzzle the other , and one pulling before , and the other pushing behind , they conveyed him upstairs , and into the parlour . It was an impressive tableau . Alfred Jingle , Esquire , alias Captain Fitz - Marshall , was standing near the door with his hat in his hand , and a smile on his face , wholly unmoved by his very unpleasant situation . Confronting him , stood Mr. Pickwick , who had evidently been inculcating some high moral lesson ; for his left hand was beneath his coat tail , and his right extended in air , as was his wo nt when delivering himself of an impressive address . At a little distance , stood Mr. Tupman with indignant countenance , carefully held back by his two younger friends ; at the farther end of the room were Mr. Nupkins , Mrs. Nupkins , and Miss Nupkins , gloomily grand and savagely vexed . ‘
167936	167971	167982	167982	Jingle	419	’ said Mr. Nupkins , with magisterial dignity , as Job was brought in--‘what prevents me from detaining these men as rogues and impostors ? It is a foolish mercy . What prevents me ? ’
167972	167980	167982	167982	Jingle	419	‘ Pride , old fellow , pride , ’
167989	168028	167982	167982	Jingle	419	‘ Would n’t do -- no go -- caught a captain , eh?--ha ! ha ! very good -- husband for daughter -- biter bit -- make it public -- not for worlds -- look stupid -- very ! ’
168029	168032	168034	168035	Mr. Nupkins	502	‘ Wretch , ’
168037	168044	168034	168035	Mr. Nupkins	502	‘ we scorn your base insinuations . ’
168045	168051	168053	168053	Henrietta	526	‘ I always hated him , ’
168055	168061	168063	168063	Jingle	419	‘ Oh , of course , ’
168065	168119	168063	168063	Jingle	419	‘ Tall young man -- old lover -- Sidney Porkenham -- rich -- fine fellow -- not so rich as captain , though , eh?--turn him away -- off with him -- anything for captain -- nothing like captain anywhere -- all the girls -- raving mad -- eh , Job , eh ? ’
168178	168182	168184	168186	the elder lady	4937	‘ Mr. Nupkins , ’
168188	168207	168184	168186	the elder lady	4937	’ this is not a fit conversation for the servants to overhear . Let these wretches be removed . ’
168208	168214	168216	168217	Mr. Nupkins	502	‘ Certainly , my dear , ’
168219	168222	168216	168217	Mr. Nupkins	502	‘ Muzzle ! ’
168223	168227	168216	168217	Mr. Nupkins	502	‘ Your Worship . ’
168228	168234	168216	168217	Mr. Nupkins	502	‘ Open the front door . ’
168235	168241	168216	168217	Mr. Nupkins	502	‘ Yes , your Worship . ’
168242	168247	168249	168250	Mr. Nupkins	502	‘ Leave the house ! ’
168266	168269	168271	168272	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Stay ! ’
168277	168281	168283	168284	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I might , ’
168286	168311	168283	168284	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ have taken a much greater revenge for the treatment I have experienced at your hands , and that of your hypocritical friend there . ’
168327	168331	168333	168334	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I say , ’
168340	168382	168333	168334	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ that I might have taken a greater revenge , but I content myself with exposing you , which I consider a duty I owe to society . This is a leniency , Sir , which I hope you will remember . ’
168416	168426	168428	168429	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ And I have only to add , sir , ’
168435	168476	168428	168429	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ that I consider you a rascal , and a -- a -- ruffian -- and -- and worse than any man I ever saw , or heard of , except that pious and sanctified vagabond in the mulberry livery . ’
168477	168482	168484	168484	Jingle	419	‘ Ha ! ha ! ’
168486	168533	168484	168484	Jingle	419	‘ good fellow , Pickwick -- fine heart -- stout old boy -- but must _ not _ be passionate -- bad thing , very -- bye , bye -- see you again some day -- keep up your spirits -- now , Job -- trot ! ’
168600	168603	168605	168606	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Sam , ’
168614	168617	168609	168610	Mr. Weller	356	‘ Sir . ’
168621	168627	168609	168610	Mr. Weller	356	’ Mr. Weller seemed uncertain . ‘
168631	168636	168609	168610	Mr. Weller	356	’ repeated Mr. Pickwick . ‘
168642	168652	168654	168655	Mr. Weller	356	‘ ere Job off , in the front garden ? ’
168657	168661	168663	168664	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Certainly not , ’
168666	168674	168663	168664	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ May n’t I kick him out o ’
168680	168685	168678	168678	Sir	9716	’ said Mr. Weller . ‘
168691	168775	168678	168678	Sir	9716	’ replied his master . For the first time since his engagement , Mr. Weller looked , for a moment , discontented and unhappy . But his countenance immediately cleared up ; for the wily Mr. Muzzle , by concealing himself behind the street door , and rushing violently out , at the right instant , contrived with great dexterity to overturn both Mr. Jingle and his attendant , down the flight of steps , into the American aloe tubs that stood beneath . ‘
168783	168791	168781	168781	Sir	9716	’ said Mr. Pickwick to Mr. Nupkins , ‘
168876	168912	168869	168869	Your	9716	’ Having thus entered his protest against their treatment of the morning , Mr. Pickwick bowed low to the ladies , and notwithstanding the solicitations of the family , left the room with his friends . ‘
168919	168924	168917	168917	Sam	240	’ said Mr. Pickwick . ‘
168932	169044	168930	168930	Sir	9716	’ said Sam , and he ran down after it . Now , there was nobody in the kitchen , but the pretty housemaid ; and as Sam ’s hat was mislaid , he had to look for it , and the pretty housemaid lighted him . They had to look all over the place for the hat . The pretty housemaid , in her anxiety to find it , went down on her knees , and turned over all the things that were heaped together in a little corner by the door . It was an awkward corner . You could n’t get at it without shutting the door first . ‘
169049	169055	168930	168930	Sir	9716	’ said the pretty housemaid . ‘
169064	169065	168930	168930	Sir	9716	’ ‘
169070	169155	169067	169067	me	0	’ said Sam . The pretty housemaid had stood the candle on the floor ; and , as it gave a very dim light , Sam was obliged to go down on _ his _ knees before he could see whether it really was his own hat or not . It was a remarkably small corner , and so -- it was nobody ’s fault but the man ’s who built the house -- Sam and the pretty housemaid were necessarily very close together . ‘
169162	169166	168930	168930	Sir	9716	’ said Sam . ‘
169171	169172	168930	168930	Sir	9716	’ ‘
169177	169183	168930	168930	Sir	9716	’ said the pretty housemaid . ‘
169188	169212	169067	169067	me	0	’ said Sam ; and as he said it , he dropped the hat that had cost so much trouble in looking for . ‘
169218	169224	169225	169225	You	0	’ said the pretty housemaid . ‘
169238	169305	169306	169306	You	0	’ So just to prevent his losing it again , she put it on for him . Whether it was that the pretty housemaid ’s face looked prettier still , when it was raised towards Sam ’s , or whether it was the accidental consequence of their being so near to each other , is matter of uncertainty to this day ; but Sam kissed her . ‘
169318	169326	169306	169306	You	0	’ said the pretty housemaid , blushing . ‘
169334	169338	169329	169329	I	0	’ said Sam ; ‘
169344	169351	169352	169352	Sam	240	’ So he kissed her again . ‘
169354	169364	169352	169352	Sam	240	’ said Mr. Pickwick , calling over the banisters . ‘
169369	169376	169367	169367	Sir	9716	’ replied Sam , running upstairs . ‘
169383	169388	169379	169379	you	0	’ said Mr. Pickwick . ‘
169412	169703	169704	169704	Sam	356	’ replied Sam . And this was the first passage of Mr. Weller ’s first love . CHAPTER XXVI . WHICH CONTAINS A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF THE PROGRESS OF THE ACTION OF BARDELL AGAINST PICKWICK Having accomplished the main end and object of his journey , by the exposure of Jingle , Mr. Pickwick resolved on immediately returning to London , with the view of becoming acquainted with the proceedings which had been taken against him , in the meantime , by Messrs. Dodson and Fogg . Acting upon this resolution with all the energy and decision of his character , he mounted to the back seat of the first coach which left Ipswich on the morning after the memorable occurrences detailed at length in the two preceding chapters ; and accompanied by his three friends , and Mr. Samuel Weller , arrived in the metropolis , in perfect health and safety , the same evening . Here the friends , for a short time , separated . Messrs. Tupman , Winkle , and Snodgrass repaired to their several homes to make such preparations as might be requisite for their forthcoming visit to Dingley Dell ; and Mr. Pickwick and Sam took up their present abode in very good , old- fashioned , and comfortable quarters , to wit , the George and Vulture Tavern and Hotel , George Yard , Lombard Street . Mr. Pickwick had dined , finished his second pint of particular port , pulled his silk handkerchief over his head , put his feet on the fender , and thrown himself back in an easy - chair , when the entrance of Mr. Weller with his carpet - bag , aroused him from his tranquil meditation . ‘
169706	169711	169712	169712	Sir	9716	’ said Mr. Pickwick . ‘
169714	169719	169712	169712	Sir	9716	’ said Mr. Weller . ‘
169728	169733	169726	169726	Sam	356	’ said Mr. Pickwick , ‘
169765	169766	169767	169767	Wery	4955	’ ‘
169772	169777	169770	169770	sir	9716	’ replied Mr. Weller . ‘
169793	169798	169791	169791	Sam	356	’ continued Mr. Pickwick , ‘
169837	169838	169842	169842	Sir	9716	’ ‘
169844	169849	169842	169842	Sir	9716	’ inquired Mr. Weller . ‘
169853	169858	169842	169842	Sir	9716	’ replied Mr. Pickwick . ‘
169864	169874	169862	169862	Sam	240	’ added Mr. Pickwick , pulling out his purse , ‘
169937	169938	169922	169923	Mrs. Bardell	369	’ ‘
169944	169949	169942	169942	sir	9716	’ replied Mr. Weller ; ‘
169951	169956	169922	169923	Mrs. Bardell	369	’ more , sir ? ’
169957	169963	169964	169965	Mr. Weller	356	‘ Nothing more , Sam . ’
170003	170006	169999	170000	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Sam . ’
170007	170012	170014	170015	Mr. Weller	356	‘ Yes , sir , ’
170028	170087	170089	170090	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I have no objection , Sam , to your endeavouring to ascertain how Mrs. Bardell herself seems disposed towards me , and whether it is really probable that this vile and groundless action is to be carried to extremity . I say I do not object to you doing this , if you wish it , Sam , ’
170238	170244	170246	170246	Sam	356	‘ Well , young townskip , ’
170248	170253	170246	170246	Sam	356	‘ how ’s mother ? ’
170254	170260	170262	170263	Master Bardell	370	‘ She ’s pretty well , ’
170265	170269	170262	170263	Master Bardell	370	‘ so am I. ’
170270	170278	170280	170280	Sam	356	‘ Well , that ’s a mercy , ’
170282	170299	170280	170280	Sam	356	‘ tell her I want to speak to her , will you , my hinfant fernomenon ? ’
170471	170477	170479	170480	Mrs. Bardell	369	‘ Mr. Pickwick ’s servant ! ’
170485	170490	170492	170493	Mrs. Cluppins	532	‘ Bless my soul ! ’
170495	170503	170492	170493	Mrs. Cluppins	532	‘ Well , I raly would not ha ’
170511	170515	170492	170493	Mrs. Cluppins	532	’ happened to ha ’
170519	170647	170492	170493	Mrs. Cluppins	532	’ said Mrs. Sanders . Mrs. Cluppins was a little , brisk , busy - looking woman ; Mrs. Sanders was a big , fat , heavy - faced personage ; and the two were the company . Mrs. Bardell felt it proper to be agitated ; and as none of the three exactly knew whether under existing circumstances , any communication , otherwise than through Dodson & amp ; Fogg , ought to be held with Mr. Pickwick ’s servant , they were all rather taken by surprise . In this state of indecision , obviously the first thing to be done , was to thump the boy for finding Mr. Weller at the door . So his mother thumped him , and he cried melodiously . ‘
170658	170663	170492	170493	Mrs. Cluppins	532	’ said Mrs. Bardell . ‘
170673	170678	170679	170679	She	4974	’ said Mrs. Sanders . ‘
170696	170705	170694	170694	Tommy	370	’ said Mrs. Cluppins , with sympathising resignation . ‘
170714	170731	170711	170712	poor lamb	4975	’ said Mrs. Sanders . At all which moral reflections , Master Bardell howled the louder . ‘
170739	170747	170748	170748	I	0	’ said Mrs. Bardell to Mrs. Cluppins . ‘
170756	170761	170748	170748	I	0	’ replied Mrs. Cluppins . ‘
170770	170771	170772	170772	I	0	’ ‘
170781	170798	170772	170772	I	0	’ said Mrs. Sanders , who , like the other friend , was bursting with curiosity . ‘
170807	170812	170800	170800	he	4975	’ said Mrs. Bardell . ‘
170817	170828	170800	170800	he	4975	’ replied Mrs. Cluppins , eagerly catching at the idea ; ‘
170844	170866	170867	170867	Wery	4980	’ Mr. Weller immediately took the hint ; and presenting himself in the parlour , explained his business to Mrs. Bardell thus-- ‘
170870	170923	170867	170867	Wery	4980	‘ casion any personal inconwenience , ma’am , as the housebreaker said to the old lady when he put her on the fire ; but as me and my governor ‘s only jest come to town , and is jest going away agin , it ca n’t be helped , you see . ’
170924	170940	170942	170943	Mrs. Cluppins	532	‘ Of course , the young man ca n’t help the faults of his master , ’
170955	170959	170962	170963	Mrs. Sanders	533	‘ Certainly not , ’
171006	171019	171021	171021	Sam	356	‘ So all I ’ve come about , is jest this here , ’
171027	171074	171075	171075	em	4982	‘ first , to give my governor ’s notice -- there it is . Secondly , to pay the rent -- here it is . Thirdly , to say as all his things is to be put together , and give to anybody as we sends for ‘
171096	171097	171080	171080	you	4983	’ ‘
171102	171107	171108	171108	I	0	’ said Mrs. Bardell , ‘
171147	171216	171136	171136	His	240	’ As Mrs. Bardell said this , she applied her handkerchief to her eyes , and went out of the room to get the receipt . Sam well knew that he had only to remain quiet , and the women were sure to talk ; so he looked alternately at the tin saucepan , the toasted cheese , the wall , and the ceiling , in profound silence . ‘
171220	171225	171136	171136	His	240	’ said Mrs. Cluppins . ‘
171231	171249	171136	171136	His	240	’ replied Mrs. Sanders . Sam said nothing . He saw they were coming to the subject . ‘
171257	171262	171250	171250	I	0	’ said Mrs. Cluppins , ‘
171305	171311	171313	171313	Sam	240	’ I wish you had , ’
171315	171356	171358	171359	Mrs. Cluppins	532	‘ To see how dreadful she takes on , going moping about , and taking no pleasure in nothing , except when her friends comes in , out of charity , to sit with her , and make her comfortable , ’
171371	171376	171358	171359	Mrs. Cluppins	532	‘ it ’s shocking ! ’
171377	171380	171382	171383	Mrs. Sanders	533	‘ Barbareous , ’
171385	171413	171415	171416	Mrs. Cluppins	532	‘ And your master , young man ! A gentleman with money , as could never feel the expense of a wife , no more than nothing , ’
171422	171444	171415	171416	Mrs. Cluppins	532	‘ why there ai n’t the faintest shade of an excuse for his behaviour ! Why do n’t he marry her ? ’
171445	171448	171450	171450	Sam	240	‘ Ah , ’
171452	171462	171450	171450	Sam	240	‘ to be sure ; that ’s the question . ’
171463	171468	171470	171471	Mrs. Cluppins	532	‘ Question , indeed , ’
171473	171528	171470	171471	Mrs. Cluppins	532	‘ she ’d question him , if she ’d my spirit . Hows’ever , there is law for us women , mis’rable creeturs as they ’d make us , if they could ; and that your master will find out , young man , to his cost , afore he ’s six months older . ’
171550	171561	171563	171563	Sam	240	‘ The action ’s going on , and no mistake , ’
171575	171584	171586	171587	Mrs. Bardell	369	‘ Here ’s the receipt , Mr. Weller , ’
171589	171620	171586	171587	Mrs. Bardell	369	‘ and here ’s the change , and I hope you ’ll take a little drop of something to keep the cold out , if it ’s only for old acquaintance ’
171626	171693	171623	171624	Mr. Weller	356	’ Sam saw the advantage he should gain , and at once acquiesced ; whereupon Mrs. Bardell produced , from a small closet , a black bottle and a wine- glass ; and so great was her abstraction , in her deep mental affliction , that , after filling Mr. Weller ’s glass , she brought out three more wine- glasses , and filled them too . ‘
171699	171704	171696	171697	Mrs. Bardell	369	’ said Mrs. Cluppins , ‘
171713	171714	171623	171624	Mr. Weller	356	’ ‘
171723	171728	171623	171624	Mr. Weller	356	’ ejaculated Mrs. Sanders . ‘
171735	171826	171623	171624	Mr. Weller	356	’ said Mrs. Bardell , with a faint smile . Sam understood all this , of course , so he said at once , that he never could drink before supper , unless a lady drank with him . A great deal of laughter ensued , and Mrs. Sanders volunteered to humour him , so she took a slight sip out of her glass . Then Sam said it must go all round , so they all took a slight sip . Then little Mrs. Cluppins proposed as a toast , ‘
171832	171853	171854	171854	I	0	’ ; and then the ladies emptied their glasses in honour of the sentiment , and got very talkative directly . ‘
171867	171872	171864	171865	Mr. Weller	356	’ said Mrs. Bardell . ‘
171880	171884	171873	171873	I	0	’ replied Sam . ‘
171904	171909	171901	171902	Mr. Weller	356	’ said Mrs. Bardell ; ‘
171968	172028	171964	171964	I	0	’ The mere idea of Mrs. Bardell ’s failing in her action , affected Mrs. Sanders so deeply , that she was under the necessity of refilling and re- emptying her glass immediately ; feeling , as she said afterwards , that if she had n’t had the presence of mind to do so , she must have dropped . ‘
172037	172041	172091	172091	Fogg	447	’ inquired Sam . ‘
172048	172053	172091	172091	Fogg	447	’ replied Mrs. Bardell . ‘
172067	172072	172055	172058	a number of witnesses	4993	’ said Mrs. Cluppins . ‘
172079	172084	172055	172058	a number of witnesses	4993	’ replied Mrs. Sanders . ‘
172102	172107	172091	172091	Fogg	447	’ added Mrs. Cluppins , ‘
172116	172117	172109	172109	they	12298	’ ‘
172124	172129	172122	172122	they	12298	’ said Mrs. Sanders . ‘
172137	172142	172143	172143	I	0	’ resumed Mrs. Cluppins . ‘
172147	172152	172143	172143	I	0	’ said Mrs. Bardell . ‘
172164	172169	172122	172122	they	12298	’ rejoined Mrs. Sanders . ‘
172172	172183	172122	172122	they	12298	’ said Sam , rising and setting down his glass , ‘
172200	172201	172191	172191	I	0	’ ‘
172207	172213	172204	172205	Mr. Weller	356	’ said Mrs. Bardell fervently . ‘
172226	172231	172233	172234	Mr. Weller	356	’ things on spec , ’
172236	172248	172233	172234	Mr. Weller	356	‘ as vell as for the other kind and gen’rous people o ’
172284	172295	172267	172268	their clerks	4998	’ by means of lawsuits -- all I can say o ’
172309	172312	172267	172268	their clerks	4998	‘ em . ’
172313	172336	172338	172341	the gratified Mrs. Bardell	369	‘ Ah , I wish they had the reward that every kind and generous heart would be inclined to bestow upon them ! ’
172343	172348	172350	172350	Sam	356	‘ Amen to that , ’
172352	172359	172350	172350	Sam	356	‘ and a fat and happy liven ’
172375	172772	172775	172775	Sam	240	’ To the great relief of Mrs. Sanders , Sam was allowed to depart without any reference , on the part of the hostess , to the pettitoes and toasted cheese ; to which the ladies , with such juvenile assistance as Master Bardell could afford , soon afterwards rendered the amplest justice-- indeed they wholly vanished before their strenuous exertions . Mr. Weller wended his way back to the George and Vulture , and faithfully recounted to his master , such indications of the sharp practice of Dodson & amp ; Fogg , as he had contrived to pick up in his visit to Mrs. Bardell ’s . An interview with Mr. Perker , next day , more than confirmed Mr. Weller ’s statement ; and Mr. Pickwick was fain to prepare for his Christmas visit to Dingley Dell , with the pleasant anticipation that some two or three months afterwards , an action brought against him for damages sustained by reason of a breach of promise of marriage , would be publicly tried in the Court of Common Pleas ; the plaintiff having all the advantages derivable , not only from the force of circumstances , but from the sharp practice of Dodson & amp ; Fogg to boot . CHAPTER XXVII . SAMUEL WELLER MAKES A PILGRIMAGE TO DORKING , AND BEHOLDS HIS MOTHER - IN - LAW There still remaining an interval of two days before the time agreed upon for the departure of the Pickwickians to Dingley Dell , Mr. Weller sat himself down in a back room at the George and Vulture , after eating an early dinner , to muse on the best way of disposing of his time . It was a remarkably fine day ; and he had not turned the matter over in his mind ten minutes , when he was suddenly stricken filial and affectionate ; and it occurred to him so strongly that he ought to go down and see his father , and pay his duty to his mother - in - law , that he was lost in astonishment at his own remissness in never thinking of this moral obligation before . Anxious to atone for his past neglect without another hour ’s delay , he straightway walked upstairs to Mr. Pickwick , and requested leave of absence for this laudable purpose . ‘
172779	172802	172805	172805	Sam	240	’ said Mr. Pickwick , his eyes glistening with delight at this manifestation of filial feeling on the part of his attendant ; ‘
172807	172815	172805	172805	Sam	240	’ Mr. Weller made a grateful bow . ‘
172838	172843	172836	172836	Sam	240	’ said Mr. Pickwick . ‘
172850	172855	172844	172844	I	0	’ replied Mr. Weller . ‘
172865	172871	172863	172863	Sam	356	’ said Mr. Pickwick approvingly . ‘
172876	172881	172874	172874	Sir	9716	’ replied Mr. Weller ; ‘

172962	172976	172960	172960	Sam	356	’ said Mr. Pickwick , shaking his head , with a slight smile . ‘
172980	173000	172957	172957	I	0	’ , sir -- the wery best intentions , as the gen’l’m’n said ven he run away from his wife ‘
173008	173013	173002	173002	she	5009	’ replied Mr. Weller . ‘
173020	173025	173018	173018	Sam	356	’ said Mr. Pickwick . ‘
173030	173325	173028	173028	Sir	9716	’ replied Mr. Weller ; and having made his best bow , and put on his best clothes , Sam planted himself on the top of the Arundel coach , and journeyed on to Dorking . The Marquis of Granby , in Mrs. Weller ’s time , was quite a model of a roadside public - house of the better class -- just large enough to be convenient , and small enough to be snug . On the opposite side of the road was a large sign - board on a high post , representing the head and shoulders of a gentleman with an apoplectic countenance , in a red coat with deep blue facings , and a touch of the same blue over his three- cornered hat , for a sky . Over that again were a pair of flags ; beneath the last button of his coat were a couple of cannon ; and the whole formed an expressive and undoubted likeness of the Marquis of Granby of glorious memory . The bar window displayed a choice collection of geranium plants , and a well - dusted row of spirit phials . The open shutters bore a variety of golden inscriptions , eulogistic of good beds and neat wines ; and the choice group of countrymen and hostlers lounging about the stable door and horse - trough , afforded presumptive proof of the excellent quality of the ale and spirits which were sold within . Sam Weller paused , when he dismounted from the coach , to note all these little indications of a thriving business , with the eye of an experienced traveller ; and having done so , stepped in at once , highly satisfied with everything he had observed . ‘
173330	173347	173350	173350	you	5011	’ said a shrill female voice the instant Sam thrust his head in at the door , ‘
173356	173921	173922	173922	Governor	537	’ Sam looked round in the direction whence the voice proceeded . It came from a rather stout lady of comfortable appearance , who was seated beside the fireplace in the bar , blowing the fire to make the kettle boil for tea . She was not alone ; for on the other side of the fireplace , sitting bolt upright in a high - backed chair , was a man in threadbare black clothes , with a back almost as long and stiff as that of the chair itself , who caught Sam ’s most particular and especial attention at once . He was a prim - faced , red - nosed man , with a long , thin countenance , and a semi - rattlesnake sort of eye -- rather sharp , but decidedly bad . He wore very short trousers , and black cotton stockings , which , like the rest of his apparel , were particularly rusty . His looks were starched , but his white neckerchief was not , and its long limp ends straggled over his closely - buttoned waistcoat in a very uncouth and unpicturesque fashion . A pair of old , worn , beaver gloves , a broad - brimmed hat , and a faded green umbrella , with plenty of whalebone sticking through the bottom , as if to counterbalance the want of a handle at the top , lay on a chair beside him ; and , being disposed in a very tidy and careful manner , seemed to imply that the red - nosed man , whoever he was , had no intention of going away in a hurry . To do the red - nosed man justice , he would have been very far from wise if he had entertained any such intention ; for , to judge from all appearances , he must have been possessed of a most desirable circle of acquaintance , if he could have reasonably expected to be more comfortable anywhere else . The fire was blazing brightly under the influence of the bellows , and the kettle was singing gaily under the influence of both . A small tray of tea - things was arranged on the table ; a plate of hot buttered toast was gently simmering before the fire ; and the red - nosed man himself was busily engaged in converting a large slice of bread into the same agreeable edible , through the instrumentality of a long brass toasting - fork . Beside him stood a glass of reeking hot pine - apple rum - and - water , with a slice of lemon in it ; and every time the red - nosed man stopped to bring the round of toast to his eye , with the view of ascertaining how it got on , he imbibed a drop or two of the hot pine - apple rum - and - water , and smiled upon the rather stout lady , as she blew the fire . Sam was so lost in the contemplation of this comfortable scene , that he suffered the first inquiry of the rather stout lady to pass unheeded . It was not until it had been twice repeated , each time in a shriller tone , that he became conscious of the impropriety of his behaviour . ‘
173925	173935	173922	173922	Governor	537	’ inquired Sam , in reply to the question . ‘
173942	173972	173938	173938	he	537	’ replied Mrs. Weller ; for the rather stout lady was no other than the quondam relict and sole executrix of the dead - and - gone Mr. Clarke ; ‘
173988	173989	173990	173990	I	0	’ ‘
173995	174001	174003	174003	Sam	356	’ up to - day ? ’
174005	174015	174017	174018	Mrs. Weller	487	‘ He may be , or he may not , ’
174035	174053	174017	174018	Mrs. Weller	487	‘ I do n’t know , and , what ’s more , I do n’t care.--Ask a blessin ’
174058	174185	174017	174018	Mrs. Weller	487	’ The red - nosed man did as he was desired , and instantly commenced on the toast with fierce voracity . The appearance of the red - nosed man had induced Sam , at first sight , to more than half suspect that he was the deputy - shepherd of whom his estimable parent had spoken . The moment he saw him eat , all doubt on the subject was removed , and he perceived at once that if he purposed to take up his temporary quarters where he was , he must make his footing good without delay . He therefore commenced proceedings by putting his arm over the half - door of the bar , coolly unbolting it , and leisurely walking in . ‘
174192	174196	174186	174190	Mother - in - law	5014	’ said Sam , ‘
174201	174202	174199	174199	you	5014	’ ‘
174213	174234	174205	174205	I	0	’ said Mrs. W. , raising her eyes to Sam ’s face , with no very gratified expression of countenance . ‘
174241	174247	174205	174205	I	0	’ said the imperturbable Sam ; ‘
174255	174279	174205	174205	I	0	‘ ll excuse me saying that I wish I was _ the _ Weller as owns you , mother - in - law . ’
174332	174338	174340	174341	Mrs. Weller	487	‘ Get along with you ! ’
174347	174354	174356	174361	the gentleman with the red nose	5019	‘ For shame , young man ! ’
174363	174372	174374	174374	Sam	356	‘ No offence , sir , no offence , ’
174376	174378	174374	174374	Sam	356	‘ you ’re
174391	174411	174432	174433	Mrs. Weller	487	’ thing , ven mothers - in - law is young and good- looking , is it , Sir ? ’
174412	174418	174420	174421	Mr. Stiggins	539	‘ It ’s all vanity , ’
174423	174430	174432	174433	Mrs. Weller	487	‘ Ah , so it is , ’
174520	174526	174528	174528	Sam	356	‘ And how ’s father ? ’
174562	174569	174558	174559	Mr. Stiggins	539	‘ What ’s the matter with that ‘
174573	174577	174578	174578	He	356	’ inquired Sam . ‘
174590	174595	174578	174578	He	356	’ replied Mrs. Weller . ‘
174604	174608	174602	174602	he	356	’ said Sam . ‘
174615	174635	174602	174602	he	356	’ added Mrs. Weller gravely . Mr. Stiggins took up a fresh piece of toast , and groaned heavily . ‘
174642	174647	174648	174651	A man of wrath	5025	’ said Mrs. Weller . ‘
174653	174701	174648	174651	A man of wrath	5025	’ exclaimed Mr. Stiggins . He took a large semi - circular bite out of the toast , and groaned again . Sam felt very strongly disposed to give the reverend Mr. Stiggins something to groan for , but he repressed his inclination , and merely asked , ‘
174706	174712	174704	174707	the old ‘ un	12510	‘ un up to now ? ’
174713	174719	174721	174722	Mrs. Weller	487	‘ Up to , indeed ! ’
174724	174779	174721	174722	Mrs. Weller	487	‘ Oh , he has a hard heart . Night after night does this excellent man -- don’t frown , Mr. Stiggins ; I _ will _ say you _ are _ an excellent man -- come and sit here , for hours together , and it has not the least effect upon him . ’
174786	174790	174704	174707	the old ‘ un	12510	’ said Sam ; ‘
174792	174813	174704	174707	the old ‘ un	12510	‘ ud have a wery considerable effect upon me , if I wos in his place ; I know that . ’
174814	174823	174825	174826	Mr. Stiggins	539	‘ The fact is , my young friend , ’
174829	174883	174825	174826	Mr. Stiggins	539	‘ he has an obderrate bosom . Oh , my young friend , who else could have resisted the pleading of sixteen of our fairest sisters , and withstood their exhortations to subscribe to our noble society for providing the infant negroes in the West Indies with flannel waistcoats and moral pocket- handkerchiefs ? ’
174884	174893	174895	174895	Sam	356	‘ What ’s a moral pocket - ankercher ? ’
174897	174903	174895	174895	Sam	356	‘ I never see one o ’

174938	174944	174946	174946	Sam	356	‘ Oh , I know , ’
174948	174958	174946	174946	Sam	356	‘ them as hangs up in the linen - drapers ’

175007	175030	175032	175033	Mrs. Weller	487	‘ Sat and smoked his pipe , and said the infant negroes were -- what did he say the infant negroes were ? ’
175035	175039	175041	175042	Mr. Stiggins	539	‘ Little humbugs , ’
175047	175056	175058	175059	Mrs. Weller	487	‘ Said the infant negroes were little humbugs , ’

175224	175261	175219	175222	the elder Mr. Weller	356	‘ though how you ’ve managed to get over your mother - in - law , is a mystery to me . I only vish you ’d write me out the receipt , that ’s all . ’
175262	175265	175267	175267	Sam	356	‘ Hush ! ’

175420	175426	175428	175429	Mr. Weller	356	‘ Red - nosed chap ? ’

175444	175452	175442	175442	Sammy	356	’ said Mr. Weller , smoking violently . ‘
175456	175460	175442	175442	Sammy	356	’ observed Sam . ‘
175466	175471	175473	175473	he	5042	’ said Mr. Weller . ‘
175475	175479	175473	175473	he	5042	’ said Sam . ‘

175631	175646	175629	175629	Sammy	356	’ said Mr. Weller , lowering his voice , and bending across the fireplace ; ‘
175662	175689	175647	175647	I	0	’ As Mr. Weller said this , he slowly recovered his former position , and winked at his first - born , in a profound manner . ‘

175860	175864	175889	175890	The shepherd	4348	’ said Sam . ‘
175871	175876	175889	175890	The shepherd	4348	’ replied the father ; ‘
175887	175888	175885	175885	Sammy	356	’ ‘
175896	175900	175885	175885	Sammy	356	’ said Sam . ‘
175903	175908	175885	175885	Sammy	356	’ replied Mr. Weller , ‘
175914	175939	175885	175885	Sammy	356	’ , and the shepherd had n’t paid a farden , not he -- perhaps it might be on account that the water warn’t o ’

Hows’ever , it warn’t paid , and so they cuts the water off . Down goes the shepherd to chapel , gives out as he ’s a persecuted saint , and says he hopes the heart of the turncock as cut the water off , ‘
176053	176094	176095	176095	em	5056	’ , sings a hymn , wotes your mother - in - law into the chair , wolunteers a collection next Sunday , and hands it all over to the shepherd . And if he ai n’t got enough out on ‘
176110	176118	176119	176119	I	0	’ said Mr. Weller , in conclusion , ‘

176136	176149	176150	176156	The worst o ’ these here shepherds	13663	’ Mr. Weller smoked for some minutes in silence , and then resumed-- ‘

176448	176454	176456	176457	Mr. Weller	356	‘ Yes , my dear , ’
176464	176471	176473	176474	Mrs. Weller	487	‘ Has Mr. Stiggins been back ? ’
176476	176486	176488	176489	Mr. Weller	356	‘ No , my dear , he has n’t , ’
176543	176544	176547	176548	you wretch	11571	’ ‘
176550	176555	176547	176548	you wretch	11571	’ said Mrs. Weller . ‘
176561	176566	176556	176556	Thank’ee	545	’ said Mr. Weller . ‘
176573	176577	176571	176571	father	10519	’ said Sam , ‘
176580	176596	176571	176571	father	10519	’ these little lovin ’s afore strangers . Here ’s the reverend gen’l’m’n a - comin ’
176600	176985	176988	176988	Sammy	356	’ At this announcement , Mrs. Weller hastily wiped off the tears which she had just begun to force on ; and Mr. W. drew his chair sullenly into the chimney - corner . Mr. Stiggins was easily prevailed on to take another glass of the hot pine - apple rum - and - water , and a second , and a third , and then to refresh himself with a slight supper , previous to beginning again . He sat on the same side as Mr. Weller , senior ; and every time he could contrive to do so , unseen by his wife , that gentleman indicated to his son the hidden emotions of his bosom , by shaking his fist over the deputy - shepherd ’s head ; a process which afforded his son the most unmingled delight and satisfaction , the more especially as Mr. Stiggins went on , quietly drinking the hot pine - apple rum - and - water , wholly unconscious of what was going forward . The major part of the conversation was confined to Mrs. Weller and the reverend Mr. Stiggins ; and the topics principally descanted on , were the virtues of the shepherd , the worthiness of his flock , and the high crimes and misdemeanours of everybody beside -- dissertations which the elder Mr. Weller occasionally interrupted by half - suppressed references to a gentleman of the name of Walker , and other running commentaries of the same kind . At length Mr. Stiggins , with several most indubitable symptoms of having quite as much pine - apple rum - and - water about him as he could comfortably accommodate , took his hat , and his leave ; and Sam was , immediately afterwards , shown to bed by his father . The respectable old gentleman wrung his hand fervently , and seemed disposed to address some observation to his son ; but on Mrs. Weller advancing towards him , he appeared to relinquish that intention , and abruptly bade him good - night . Sam was up betimes next day , and having partaken of a hasty breakfast , prepared to return to London . He had scarcely set foot without the house , when his father stood before him . ‘
176990	176995	176988	176988	Sammy	356	’ inquired Mr. Weller . ‘
177000	177004	176988	176988	Sammy	356	’ replied Sam . ‘

177059	177075	177035	177035	Sam	356	’ Mr. Weller the elder fixed on his son an earnest look , and replied , ‘

177259	177263	177251	177251	Pison	494	’ said Sam . ‘
177266	177279	177281	177281	you	356	’ said Mr. Weller , shaking his son eagerly by the hand , ‘

177345	178442	177338	177338	I	0	’ The elder Mr. Weller bestowed a look of deep , unspeakable admiration on his son , and , having once more grasped his hand , walked slowly away , revolving in his mind the numerous reflections to which his advice had given rise . Sam looked after him , until he turned a corner of the road ; and then set forward on his walk to London . He meditated at first , on the probable consequences of his own advice , and the likelihood of his father ’s adopting it . He dismissed the subject from his mind , however , with the consolatory reflection that time alone would show ; and this is the reflection we would impress upon the reader . CHAPTER XXVIII . A GOOD - HUMOURED CHRISTMAS CHAPTER , CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF A WEDDING , AND SOME OTHER SPORTS BESIDE : WHICH ALTHOUGH IN THEIR WAY , EVEN AS GOOD CUSTOMS AS MARRIAGE ITSELF , ARE NOT QUITE SO RELIGIOUSLY KEPT UP , IN THESE DEGENERATE TIMES As brisk as bees , if not altogether as light as fairies , did the four Pickwickians assemble on the morning of the twenty - second day of December , in the year of grace in which these , their faithfully - recorded adventures , were undertaken and accomplished . Christmas was close at hand , in all his bluff and hearty honesty ; it was the season of hospitality , merriment , and open - heartedness ; the old year was preparing , like an ancient philosopher , to call his friends around him , and amidst the sound of feasting and revelry to pass gently and calmly away . Gay and merry was the time ; and right gay and merry were at least four of the numerous hearts that were gladdened by its coming . And numerous indeed are the hearts to which Christmas brings a brief season of happiness and enjoyment . How many families , whose members have been dispersed and scattered far and wide , in the restless struggles of life , are then reunited , and meet once again in that happy state of companionship and mutual goodwill , which is a source of such pure and unalloyed delight ; and one so incompatible with the cares and sorrows of the world , that the religious belief of the most civilised nations , and the rude traditions of the roughest savages , alike number it among the first joys of a future condition of existence , provided for the blessed and happy ! How many old recollections , and how many dormant sympathies , does Christmas time awaken ! We write these words now , many miles distant from the spot at which , year after year , we met on that day , a merry and joyous circle . Many of the hearts that throbbed so gaily then , have ceased to beat ; many of the looks that shone so brightly then , have ceased to glow ; the hands we grasped , have grown cold ; the eyes we sought , have hid their lustre in the grave ; and yet the old house , the room , the merry voices and smiling faces , the jest , the laugh , the most minute and trivial circumstances connected with those happy meetings , crowd upon our mind at each recurrence of the season , as if the last assemblage had been but yesterday ! Happy , happy Christmas , that can win us back to the delusions of our childish days ; that can recall to the old man the pleasures of his youth ; that can transport the sailor and the traveller , thousands of miles away , back to his own fireside and his quiet home ! But we are so taken up and occupied with the good qualities of this saint Christmas , that we are keeping Mr. Pickwick and his friends waiting in the cold on the outside of the Muggleton coach , which they have just attained , well wrapped up in great - coats , shawls , and comforters . The portmanteaus and carpet - bags have been stowed away , and Mr. Weller and the guard are endeavouring to insinuate into the fore- boot a huge cod - fish several sizes too large for it -- which is snugly packed up , in a long brown basket , with a layer of straw over the top , and which has been left to the last , in order that he may repose in safety on the half - dozen barrels of real native oysters , all the property of Mr. Pickwick , which have been arranged in regular order at the bottom of the receptacle . The interest displayed in Mr. Pickwick ’s countenance is most intense , as Mr. Weller and the guard try to squeeze the cod - fish into the boot , first head first , and then tail first , and then top upward , and then bottom upward , and then side - ways , and then long - ways , all of which artifices the implacable cod - fish sturdily resists , until the guard accidentally hits him in the very middle of the basket , whereupon he suddenly disappears into the boot , and with him , the head and shoulders of the guard himself , who , not calculating upon so sudden a cessation of the passive resistance of the cod - fish , experiences a very unexpected shock , to the unsmotherable delight of all the porters and bystanders . Upon this , Mr. Pickwick smiles with great good - humour , and drawing a shilling from his waistcoat pocket , begs the guard , as he picks himself out of the boot , to drink his health in a glass of hot brandy - and - water ; at which the guard smiles too , and Messrs. Snodgrass , Winkle , and Tupman , all smile in company . The guard and Mr. Weller disappear for five minutes , most probably to get the hot brandy - and - water , for they smell very strongly of it , when they return , the coachman mounts to the box , Mr. Weller jumps up behind , the Pickwickians pull their coats round their legs and their shawls over their noses , the helpers pull the horse - cloths off , the coachman shouts out a cheery ‘
178446	178822	177338	177338	I	0	’ and away they go . They have rumbled through the streets , and jolted over the stones , and at length reach the wide and open country . The wheels skim over the hard and frosty ground ; and the horses , bursting into a canter at a smart crack of the whip , step along the road as if the load behind them-- coach , passengers , cod - fish , oyster - barrels , and all -- were but a feather at their heels . They have descended a gentle slope , and enter upon a level , as compact and dry as a solid block of marble , two miles long . Another crack of the whip , and on they speed , at a smart gallop , the horses tossing their heads and rattling the harness , as if in exhilaration at the rapidity of the motion ; while the coachman , holding whip and reins in one hand , takes off his hat with the other , and resting it on his knees , pulls out his handkerchief , and wipes his forehead , partly because he has a habit of doing it , and partly because it ’s as well to show the passengers how cool he is , and what an easy thing it is to drive four - in - hand , when you have had as much practice as he has . Having done this very leisurely ( otherwise the effect would be materially impaired ) , he replaces his handkerchief , pulls on his hat , adjusts his gloves , squares his elbows , cracks the whip again , and on they speed , more merrily than before . A few small houses , scattered on either side of the road , betoken the entrance to some town or village . The lively notes of the guard ’s key- bugle vibrate in the clear cold air , and wake up the old gentleman inside , who , carefully letting down the window - sash half - way , and standing sentry over the air , takes a short peep out , and then carefully pulling it up again , informs the other inside that they ’re

179513	179519	179508	179509	The coachman	9761	‘ Now then , gen’l’m’n , ’
179571	179574	179568	179569	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ All right ’
179802	179805	179807	179808	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Aha ! ’
179810	179813	179815	179817	the fat boy	1437	‘ Aha ! ’
179847	179859	179861	179862	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Well , you look rosy enough , my young friend , ’
179864	179878	179880	179882	the fat boy	1437	‘ I ’ve been asleep , right in front of the taproom fire , ’
179907	179930	179938	179938	he	5132	‘ Master sent me over with the chay - cart , to carry your luggage up to the house . He ’d ha ’

179956	179979	179938	179938	he	5132	’ said Mr. Pickwick hastily , for he remembered how they had travelled over nearly the same ground on a previous occasion . ‘

179995	180000	179993	179993	Sir	9716	’ said Mr. Weller . ‘
180028	180128	180021	180021	We	5133	’ Having given this direction , and settled with the coachman , Mr. Pickwick and his three friends struck into the footpath across the fields , and walked briskly away , leaving Mr. Weller and the fat boy confronted together for the first time . Sam looked at the fat boy with great astonishment , but without saying a word ; and began to stow the luggage rapidly away in the cart , while the fat boy stood quietly by , and seemed to think it a very interesting sort of thing to see Mr. Weller working by himself . ‘
180131	180143	180021	180021	We	5133	’ said Sam , throwing in the last carpet - bag , ‘
180148	180149	180021	180021	We	5133	’ ‘
180152	180164	180021	180021	We	5133	’ said the fat boy , in a very satisfied tone , ‘

180198	180204	180171	180171	Vell	497	’ said the fat boy . ‘

180408	180465	180395	180395	you	0	’ The Blue Lion tap was soon gained , and the fat boy swallowed a glass of liquor without so much as winking -- a feat which considerably advanced him in Mr. Weller ’s good opinion . Mr. Weller having transacted a similar piece of business on his own account , they got into the cart . ‘
180470	180476	180467	180467	you	0	’ said the fat boy . ‘
180483	180487	180477	180477	I	0	’ replied Sam . ‘
180492	180511	180517	180517	you	0	’ said the fat boy , putting the reins in his hand , and pointing up a lane , ‘
180527	180566	180521	180521	you	0	’ With these words , the fat boy laid himself affectionately down by the side of the cod - fish , and , placing an oyster - barrel under his head for a pillow , fell asleep instantaneously . ‘
180569	180573	180521	180521	you	0	’ said Sam , ‘
180602	180778	180599	180600	young dropsy	5142	’ But as young dropsy evinced no symptoms of returning animation , Sam Weller sat himself down in front of the cart , and starting the old horse with a jerk of the rein , jogged steadily on , towards the Manor Farm . Meanwhile , Mr. Pickwick and his friends having walked their blood into active circulation , proceeded cheerfully on . The paths were hard ; the grass was crisp and frosty ; the air had a fine , dry , bracing coldness ; and the rapid approach of the gray twilight ( slate - coloured is a better term in frosty weather ) made them look forward with pleasant anticipation to the comforts which awaited them at their hospitable entertainer ’s . It was the sort of afternoon that might induce a couple of elderly gentlemen , in a lonely field , to take off their greatcoats and play at leap - frog in pure lightness of heart and gaiety ; and we firmly believe that had Mr. Tupman at that moment proffered ‘
180782	180880	180599	180600	young dropsy	5142	’ Mr. Pickwick would have accepted his offer with the utmost avidity . However , Mr. Tupman did not volunteer any such accommodation , and the friends walked on , conversing merrily . As they turned into a lane they had to cross , the sound of many voices burst upon their ears ; and before they had even had time to form a guess to whom they belonged , they walked into the very centre of the party who were expecting their arrival -- a fact which was first notified to the Pickwickians , by the loud ‘
180883	181597	181598	181598	Mother	895	’ which burst from old Wardle ’s lips , when they appeared in sight . First , there was Wardle himself , looking , if that were possible , more jolly than ever ; then there were Bella and her faithful Trundle ; and , lastly , there were Emily and some eight or ten young ladies , who had all come down to the wedding , which was to take place next day , and who were in as happy and important a state as young ladies usually are , on such momentous occasions ; and they were , one and all , startling the fields and lanes , far and wide , with their frolic and laughter . The ceremony of introduction , under such circumstances , was very soon performed , or we should rather say that the introduction was soon over , without any ceremony at all . In two minutes thereafter , Mr. Pickwick was joking with the young ladies who would n’t come over the stile while he looked -- or who , having pretty feet and unexceptionable ankles , preferred standing on the top rail for five minutes or so , declaring that they were too frightened to move -- with as much ease and absence of reserve or constraint , as if he had known them for life . It is worthy of remark , too , that Mr. Snodgrass offered Emily far more assistance than the absolute terrors of the stile ( although it was full three feet high , and had only a couple of stepping - stones ) would seem to require ; while one black - eyed young lady in a very nice little pair of boots with fur round the top , was observed to scream very loudly , when Mr. Winkle offered to help her over . All this was very snug and pleasant . And when the difficulties of the stile were at last surmounted , and they once more entered on the open field , old Wardle informed Mr. Pickwick how they had all been down in a body to inspect the furniture and fittings - up of the house , which the young couple were to tenant , after the Christmas holidays ; at which communication Bella and Trundle both coloured up , as red as the fat boy after the taproom fire ; and the young lady with the black eyes and the fur round the boots , whispered something in Emily ’s ear , and then glanced archly at Mr. Snodgrass ; to which Emily responded that she was a foolish girl , but turned very red , notwithstanding ; and Mr. Snodgrass , who was as modest as all great geniuses usually are , felt the crimson rising to the crown of his head , and devoutly wished , in the inmost recesses of his own heart , that the young lady aforesaid , with her black eyes , and her archness , and her boots with the fur round the top , were all comfortably deposited in the adjacent county . But if they were social and happy outside the house , what was the warmth and cordiality of their reception when they reached the farm ! The very servants grinned with pleasure at sight of Mr. Pickwick ; and Emma bestowed a half - demure , half - impudent , and all - pretty look of recognition , on Mr. Tupman , which was enough to make the statue of Bonaparte in the passage , unfold his arms , and clasp her within them . The old lady was seated with customary state in the front parlour , but she was rather cross , and , by consequence , most particularly deaf . She never went out herself , and like a great many other old ladies of the same stamp , she was apt to consider it an act of domestic treason , if anybody else took the liberty of doing what she could n’t . So , bless her old soul , she sat as upright as she could , in her great chair , and looked as fierce as might be -- and that was benevolent after all . ‘
181600	181604	181605	181606	Mr. Pickwick	240	’ said Wardle , ‘
181612	181613	181608	181608	You	895	’ ‘
181617	181627	181608	181608	You	895	’ replied the old lady , with great dignity . ‘
181655	181677	181651	181651	they	1826	’ Here the old lady tossed her head , and smoothed down her lavender - coloured silk dress with trembling hands . ‘
181684	181689	181690	181690	I	0	’ said Mr. Pickwick , ‘
181736	181745	181746	181748	The old lady	10352	’re eight - and - forty hours older . ’
181771	181780	181767	181767	she	10352	‘ Ah ! I ca n’t hear him ! ’
181781	181786	181788	181788	Wardle	292	‘ Nonsense , mother , ’
181790	181821	181767	181767	she	10352	‘ Come , come , do n’t be cross , there ’s a good soul . Recollect Bella ; come , you must keep her spirits up , poor girl . ’
181876	181894	181872	181873	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Ah , Mr. Pickwick , young people was very different , when I was a girl . ’
181895	181903	181905	181906	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ No doubt of that , ma’am , ’
181908	182251	181905	181906	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ and that ’s the reason why I would make much of the few that have any traces of the old stock’--and saying this , Mr. Pickwick gently pulled Bella towards him , and bestowing a kiss upon her forehead , bade her sit down on the little stool at her grandmother ’s feet . Whether the expression of her countenance , as it was raised towards the old lady ’s face , called up a thought of old times , or whether the old lady was touched by Mr. Pickwick ’s affectionate good- nature , or whatever was the cause , she was fairly melted ; so she threw herself on her granddaughter ’s neck , and all the little ill - humour evaporated in a gush of silent tears . A happy party they were , that night . Sedate and solemn were the score of rubbers in which Mr. Pickwick and the old lady played together ; uproarious was the mirth of the round table . Long after the ladies had retired , did the hot elder wine , well qualified with brandy and spice , go round , and round , and round again ; and sound was the sleep and pleasant were the dreams that followed . It is a remarkable fact that those of Mr. Snodgrass bore constant reference to Emily Wardle ; and that the principal figure in Mr. Winkle ’s visions was a young lady with black eyes , and arch smile , and a pair of remarkably nice boots with fur round the tops . Mr. Pickwick was awakened early in the morning , by a hum of voices and a pattering of feet , sufficient to rouse even the fat boy from his heavy slumbers . He sat up in bed and listened . The female servants and female visitors were running constantly to and fro ; and there were such multitudinous demands for hot water , such repeated outcries for needles and thread , and so many half - suppressed entreaties of ‘
182265	182923	182262	182263	a dear	11050	’ that Mr. Pickwick in his innocence began to imagine that something dreadful must have occurred -- when he grew more awake , and remembered the wedding . The occasion being an important one , he dressed himself with peculiar care , and descended to the breakfast- room . There were all the female servants in a bran new uniform of pink muslin gowns with white bows in their caps , running about the house in a state of excitement and agitation which it would be impossible to describe . The old lady was dressed out in a brocaded gown , which had not seen the light for twenty years , saving and excepting such truant rays as had stolen through the chinks in the box in which it had been laid by , during the whole time . Mr. Trundle was in high feather and spirits , but a little nervous withal . The hearty old landlord was trying to look very cheerful and unconcerned , but failing signally in the attempt . All the girls were in tears and white muslin , except a select two or three , who were being honoured with a private view of the bride and bridesmaids , upstairs . All the Pickwickians were in most blooming array ; and there was a terrific roaring on the grass in front of the house , occasioned by all the men , boys , and hobbledehoys attached to the farm , each of whom had got a white bow in his button - hole , and all of whom were cheering with might and main ; being incited thereto , and stimulated therein by the precept and example of Mr. Samuel Weller , who had managed to become mighty popular already , and was as much at home as if he had been born on the land . A wedding is a licensed subject to joke upon , but there really is no great joke in the matter after all;--we speak merely of the ceremony , and beg it to be distinctly understood that we indulge in no hidden sarcasm upon a married life . Mixed up with the pleasure and joy of the occasion , are the many regrets at quitting home , the tears of parting between parent and child , the consciousness of leaving the dearest and kindest friends of the happiest portion of human life , to encounter its cares and troubles with others still untried and little known -- natural feelings which we would not render this chapter mournful by describing , and which we should be still more unwilling to be supposed to ridicule . Let us briefly say , then , that the ceremony was performed by the old clergyman , in the parish church of Dingley Dell , and that Mr. Pickwick ’s name is attached to the register , still preserved in the vestry thereof ; that the young lady with the black eyes signed her name in a very unsteady and tremulous manner ; that Emily ’s signature , as the other bridesmaid , is nearly illegible ; that it all went off in very admirable style ; that the young ladies generally thought it far less shocking than they had expected ; and that although the owner of the black eyes and the arch smile informed Mr. Wardle that she was sure she could never submit to anything so dreadful , we have the very best reasons for thinking she was mistaken . To all this , we may add , that Mr. Pickwick was the first who saluted the bride , and that in so doing he threw over her neck a rich gold watch and chain , which no mortal eyes but the jeweller ’s had ever beheld before . Then , the old church bell rang as gaily as it could , and they all returned to breakfast . ‘
182937	182978	182979	182979	Wery	5156	’ said Mr. Weller to the fat boy , as he assisted in laying out such articles of consumption as had not been duly arranged on the previous night . The fat boy pointed to the destination of the pies . ‘

183591	183599	183601	183605	the hard - headed gentleman	5183	‘ With great satisfaction , Mr. Pickwick , ’
183608	183615	183617	183620	the benevolent old clergyman	5185	‘ You ’ll take me in ? ’
183622	183626	183628	183629	his wife	1301	‘ And me , ’
183631	183638	183640	183658	a couple of poor relations at the bottom of the table , who had eaten and drunk very heartily	5187	‘ And me , and me , ’
183685	183690	183692	183693	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Ladies and gentlemen , ’
183698	183711	183713	183714	Mr. Weller	356	‘ Hear , hear ! Hear , hear ! Hear , hear ! ’
183723	183730	183732	183733	old Wardle	292	‘ Call in all the servants , ’
183754	183772	183732	183733	old Wardle	292	‘ Give them a glass of wine each to drink the toast in . Now , Pickwick . ’
183799	183837	183796	183797	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Ladies and gentlemen -- no , I wo n’t say ladies and gentlemen , I ’ll call you my friends , my dear friends , if the ladies will allow me to take so great a liberty-- ’
183900	183904	183892	183898	the young lady with the black eyes	13858	‘ Go away , ’
183922	183927	183892	183898	the young lady with the black eyes	13858	‘ if you can . ’
183928	183933	183935	183936	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ My dear friends , ’
183938	183954	183955	183955	em	5197	‘ I am going to propose the health of the bride and bridegroom -- God bless ‘
184049	184053	184046	184046	I	0	’ added Mr. Pickwick-- ‘
184255	184704	184705	184705	You	5216	’ Mr. Pickwick concluded amidst a whirlwind of applause ; and once more were the lungs of the supernumeraries , under Mr. Weller ’s command , brought into active and efficient operation . Mr. Wardle proposed Mr. Pickwick ; Mr. Pickwick proposed the old lady . Mr. Snodgrass proposed Mr. Wardle ; Mr. Wardle proposed Mr. Snodgrass . One of the poor relations proposed Mr. Tupman , and the other poor relation proposed Mr. Winkle ; all was happiness and festivity , until the mysterious disappearance of both the poor relations beneath the table , warned the party that it was time to adjourn . At dinner they met again , after a five - and - twenty mile walk , undertaken by the males at Wardle ’s recommendation , to get rid of the effects of the wine at breakfast . The poor relations had kept in bed all day , with the view of attaining the same happy consummation , but , as they had been unsuccessful , they stopped there . Mr. Weller kept the domestics in a state of perpetual hilarity ; and the fat boy divided his time into small alternate allotments of eating and sleeping . The dinner was as hearty an affair as the breakfast , and was quite as noisy , without the tears . Then came the dessert and some more toasts . Then came the tea and coffee ; and then , the ball . The best sitting - room at Manor Farm was a good , long , dark - panelled room with a high chimney - piece , and a capacious chimney , up which you could have driven one of the new patent cabs , wheels and all . At the upper end of the room , seated in a shady bower of holly and evergreens were the two best fiddlers , and the only harp , in all Muggleton . In all sorts of recesses , and on all kinds of brackets , stood massive old silver candlesticks with four branches each . The carpet was up , the candles burned bright , the fire blazed and crackled on the hearth , and merry voices and light - hearted laughter rang through the room . If any of the old English yeomen had turned into fairies when they died , it was just the place in which they would have held their revels . If anything could have added to the interest of this agreeable scene , it would have been the remarkable fact of Mr. Pickwick ’s appearing without his gaiters , for the first time within the memory of his oldest friends . ‘
184710	184714	184705	184705	You	5216	’ said Wardle . ‘
184720	184725	184717	184717	I	0	’ replied Mr. Pickwick . ‘
184737	184753	184755	184755	You	5216	’ Mr. Pickwick called attention to his speckled silk stockings , and smartly tied pumps . ‘
184761	184767	184755	184755	You	5216	’ exclaimed Mr. Tupman jocosely . ‘
184777	184787	184772	184772	sir	9716	’ said Mr. Pickwick , turning warmly upon him . ‘
184803	184808	184809	184809	I	0	’ responded Mr. Tupman . ‘
184819	184859	184815	184815	I	0	’ said Mr. Pickwick , in a very peremptory tone . Mr. Tupman had contemplated a laugh , but he found it was a serious matter ; so he looked grave , and said they were a pretty pattern . ‘
184865	184877	184860	184860	I	0	’ said Mr. Pickwick , fixing his eyes upon his friend . ‘
184896	184897	184894	184894	Sir	9716	’ ‘
184906	184926	184927	184927	We	5221	’ replied Mr. Tupman . He walked away ; and Mr. Pickwick ’s countenance resumed its customary benign expression . ‘
184935	184969	184932	184932	I	0	’ said Mr. Pickwick , who was stationed with the old lady at the top of the dance , and had already made four false starts , in his excessive anxiety to commence . ‘
184975	184979	184932	184932	I	0	’ said Wardle . ‘
184982	185015	184932	184932	I	0	’ Up struck the two fiddles and the one harp , and off went Mr. Pickwick into hands across , when there was a general clapping of hands , and a cry of ‘
185020	185021	184932	184932	I	0	’ ‘
185027	185064	184932	184932	I	0	’ said Mr. Pickwick , who was only brought to , by the fiddles and harp desisting , and could have been stopped by no other earthly power , if the house had been on fire . ‘
185070	185076	185067	185068	Arabella Allen	297	’ cried a dozen voices . ‘
185080	185085	185078	185078	Winkle	276	’ added Mr. Tupman . ‘
185090	185134	185078	185078	Winkle	276	’ exclaimed that gentleman , emerging with his pretty companion from the corner ; as he did so , it would have been hard to tell which was the redder in the face , he or the young lady with the black eyes . ‘
185144	185152	185142	185142	Winkle	276	’ said Mr. Pickwick , rather pettishly , ‘
185163	185164	185154	185154	you	276	’ ‘
185170	185175	185154	185154	you	276	’ said Mr. Winkle . ‘
185178	185196	185154	185154	you	276	’ said Mr. Pickwick , with a very expressive smile , as his eyes rested on Arabella , ‘
185215	185517	185546	185547	Mr. Weller	356	’ However , there was no time to think more about the matter , for the fiddles and harp began in real earnest . Away went Mr. Pickwick -- hands across -- down the middle to the very end of the room , and half - way up the chimney , back again to the door -- poussette everywhere -- loud stamp on the ground -- ready for the next couple -- off again -- all the figure over once more -- another stamp to beat out the time -- next couple , and the next , and the next again -- never was such going ; at last , after they had reached the bottom of the dance , and full fourteen couple after the old lady had retired in an exhausted state , and the clergyman ’s wife had been substituted in her stead , did that gentleman , when there was no demand whatever on his exertions , keep perpetually dancing in his place , to keep time to the music , smiling on his partner all the while with a blandness of demeanour which baffles all description . Long before Mr. Pickwick was weary of dancing , the newly - married couple had retired from the scene . There was a glorious supper downstairs , notwithstanding , and a good long sitting after it ; and when Mr. Pickwick awoke , late the next morning , he had a confused recollection of having , severally and confidentially , invited somewhere about five - and - forty people to dine with him at the George and Vulture , the very first time they came to London ; which Mr. Pickwick rightly considered a pretty certain indication of his having taken something besides exercise , on the previous night . ‘
185537	185543	185546	185547	Mr. Weller	356	’ inquired Sam of Emma . ‘
185549	185553	185546	185547	Mr. Weller	356	’ replied Emma ; ‘
185573	185574	185561	185561	Master	3520	’ ‘

185596	185616	185593	185594	Mr. Weller	356	‘ I never see such a sensible sort of man as he is , or such a reg’lar gen’l’m’n . ’
185623	185634	185620	185620	he	12002	’ said the fat boy , joining in the conversation ; ‘
185642	185666	185637	185637	he	12002	’ The fat youth gave a semi - cannibalic leer at Mr. Weller , as he thought of the roast legs and gravy . ‘
185680	185689	185678	185678	you	5222	’ said Sam . The fat boy nodded . ‘
185703	185709	185690	185690	I	0	’ said Mr. Weller impressively ; ‘

185765	185776	185777	185777	I	0	’ inquired the fat boy , in a faltering voice . ‘
185778	185786	185788	185789	Mr. Weller	356	’m a - going to tell you , ’
185791	185796	185788	185789	Mr. Weller	356	‘ he was one o ’

186119	186132	186100	186100	he	0	’ out furder than ever , and the great round watch almost bustin ’
186159	186167	186213	186215	the old gen’l’m’n	5231	‘ ud never break , and the watch ‘
186220	186268	186285	186285	he	5231	’ along , and he sees a pickpocket as he know’d by sight , a - coming up , arm in arm with a little boy with a wery large head . “ Here ’s a game , ” says the old gen’l’m’n to himself , “ they ’re
186289	186358	186285	186285	he	5231	’ wery hearty , wen , all of a sudden , the little boy leaves hold of the pickpocket ’s arm , and rushes head foremost straight into the old gen’l’m’n ’s stomach , and for a moment doubles him right up with the pain . “ Murder ! ” says the old gen’l’m’n . “ All right , Sir , ” says the pickpocket , a - wisperin ’
186424	187238	186406	186406	you	5246	’ As Mr. Weller concluded this moral tale , with which the fat boy appeared much affected , they all three repaired to the large kitchen , in which the family were by this time assembled , according to annual custom on Christmas Eve , observed by old Wardle ’s forefathers from time immemorial . From the centre of the ceiling of this kitchen , old Wardle had just suspended , with his own hands , a huge branch of mistletoe , and this same branch of mistletoe instantaneously gave rise to a scene of general and most delightful struggling and confusion ; in the midst of which , Mr. Pickwick , with a gallantry that would have done honour to a descendant of Lady Tollimglower herself , took the old lady by the hand , led her beneath the mystic branch , and saluted her in all courtesy and decorum . The old lady submitted to this piece of practical politeness with all the dignity which befitted so important and serious a solemnity , but the younger ladies , not being so thoroughly imbued with a superstitious veneration for the custom , or imagining that the value of a salute is very much enhanced if it cost a little trouble to obtain it , screamed and struggled , and ran into corners , and threatened and remonstrated , and did everything but leave the room , until some of the less adventurous gentlemen were on the point of desisting , when they all at once found it useless to resist any longer , and submitted to be kissed with a good grace . Mr. Winkle kissed the young lady with the black eyes , and Mr. Snodgrass kissed Emily ; and Mr. Weller , not being particular about the form of being under the mistletoe , kissed Emma and the other female servants , just as he caught them . As to the poor relations , they kissed everybody , not even excepting the plainer portions of the young lady visitors , who , in their excessive confusion , ran right under the mistletoe , as soon as it was hung up , without knowing it ! Wardle stood with his back to the fire , surveying the whole scene , with the utmost satisfaction ; and the fat boy took the opportunity of appropriating to his own use , and summarily devouring , a particularly fine mince - pie , that had been carefully put by , for somebody else . Now , the screaming had subsided , and faces were in a glow , and curls in a tangle , and Mr. Pickwick , after kissing the old lady as before mentioned , was standing under the mistletoe , looking with a very pleased countenance on all that was passing around him , when the young lady with the black eyes , after a little whispering with the other young ladies , made a sudden dart forward , and , putting her arm round Mr. Pickwick ’s neck , saluted him affectionately on the left cheek ; and before Mr. Pickwick distinctly knew what was the matter , he was surrounded by the whole body , and kissed by every one of them . It was a pleasant thing to see Mr. Pickwick in the centre of the group , now pulled this way , and then that , and first kissed on the chin , and then on the nose , and then on the spectacles , and to hear the peals of laughter which were raised on every side ; but it was a still more pleasant thing to see Mr. Pickwick , blinded shortly afterwards with a silk handkerchief , falling up against the wall , and scrambling into corners , and going through all the mysteries of blind - man ’s buff , with the utmost relish for the game , until at last he caught one of the poor relations , and then had to evade the blind - man himself , which he did with a nimbleness and agility that elicited the admiration and applause of all beholders . The poor relations caught the people who they thought would like it , and , when the game flagged , got caught themselves . When they all tired of blind - man ’s buff , there was a great game at snap- dragon , and when fingers enough were burned with that , and all the raisins were gone , they sat down by the huge fire of blazing logs to a substantial supper , and a mighty bowl of wassail , something smaller than an ordinary wash - house copper , in which the hot apples were hissing and bubbling with a rich look , and a jolly sound , that were perfectly irresistible . ‘
187241	187250	186406	186406	you	5246	’ said Mr. Pickwick , looking round him , ‘
187258	187259	187260	187260	Our	5248	’ ‘
187264	187269	187260	187260	Our	5248	’ replied Mr. Wardle . ‘
187325	187368	187315	187315	Trundle	290	’ Up flew the bright sparks in myriads as the logs were stirred . The deep red blaze sent forth a rich glow , that penetrated into the farthest corner of the room , and cast its cheerful tint on every face . ‘
187371	187375	187315	187315	Trundle	290	’ said Wardle , ‘
187395	187396	187383	187383	I	0	’ ‘

187449	187474	187475	187475	I	0	’ Thus saying , the merry old gentleman , in a good , round , sturdy voice , commenced without more ado-- A CHRISTMAS CAROL ‘
187547	187622	187540	187540	He	0	‘ Let the Summer sun to his bright home run , He shall never be sought by me ; When he ’s dimmed by a cloud I can laugh aloud And care not how sulky he be ! For his darling child is the madness wild That sports in fierce fever ’s train ; And when love is too strong , it do n’t last long , As many have found to their pain . ‘
187688	187769	187776	187776	he	5255	‘ But my song I troll out , for _ Christmas _ Stout , The hearty , the true , and the bold ; A bumper I drain , and with might and main Give three cheers for this Christmas old ! We ’ll usher him in with a merry din That shall gladden his joyous heart , And we ’ll keep him up , while there ’s bite or sup , And in fellowship good , we ’ll part . ‘
187790	187846	187898	187899	the men	10159	’re no disgrace , for there ’s much the same trace On the cheeks of our bravest tars . Then again I sing till the roof doth ring And it echoes from wall to wall -- To the stout old wight , fair welcome to - night , As the King of the Seasons all ! ’
187889	187894	187896	187899	one of the men	5258	‘ How it snows ! ’
187906	187912	187914	187914	Wardle	292	‘ Snows , does it ? ’
187916	187924	187926	187927	the man	835	‘ Rough , cold night , Sir , ’
187929	187951	187926	187927	the man	835	‘ and there ’s a wind got up , that drifts it across the fields , in a thick white cloud . ’
187952	187958	187960	187962	the old lady	10352	‘ What does Jem say ? ’
187964	187975	187960	187962	the old lady	10352	‘ There ai n’t anything the matter , is there ? ’
187976	187983	187985	187985	Wardle	292	‘ No , no , mother , ’
187987	188017	187985	187985	Wardle	292	‘ he says there ’s a snowdrift , and a wind that ’s piercing cold . I should know that , by the way it rumbles in the chimney . ’
188018	188021	188023	188025	the old lady	10352	‘ Ah ! ’
188027	188092	188023	188025	the old lady	10352	‘ there was just such a wind , and just such a fall of snow , a good many years back , I recollect -- just five years before your poor father died . It was a Christmas Eve , too ; and I remember that on that very night he told us the story about the goblins that carried away old Gabriel Grub . ’
188093	188099	188101	188102	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ The story about what ? ’
188104	188111	188113	188113	Wardle	292	‘ Oh , nothing , nothing , ’
188115	188136	188113	188113	Wardle	292	‘ About an old sexton , that the good people down here suppose to have been carried away by goblins . ’
188137	188140	188142	188144	the old lady	10352	‘ Suppose ! ’
188146	188188	188142	188144	the old lady	10352	‘ Is there anybody hardy enough to disbelieve it ? Suppose ! Have n’t you heard ever since you were a child , that he _ was _ carried away by the goblins , and do n’t you know he was ? ’
188189	188202	188204	188204	Wardle	292	‘ Very well , mother , he was , if you like , ’
188207	188228	188204	188204	Wardle	292	‘ He _ was _ carried away by goblins , Pickwick ; and there ’s an end of the matter . ’
188229	188234	188236	188237	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ No , no , ’
188239	188264	188236	188237	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ not an end of it , I assure you ; for I must hear how , and why , and all about it . ’
188375	188626	188369	188374	THE GOBLINS WHO STOLE A SEXTON	554	‘ In an old abbey town , down in this part of the country , a long , long while ago -- so long , that the story must be a true one , because our great - grandfathers implicitly believed it -- there officiated as sexton and grave - digger in the churchyard , one Gabriel Grub . It by no means follows that because a man is a sexton , and constantly surrounded by the emblems of mortality , therefore he should be a morose and melancholy man ; your undertakers are the merriest fellows in the world ; and I once had the honour of being on intimate terms with a mute , who in private life , and off duty , was as comical and jocose a little fellow as ever chirped out a devil - may - care song , without a hitch in his memory , or drained off a good stiff glass without stopping for breath . But notwithstanding these precedents to the contrary , Gabriel Grub was an ill - conditioned , cross - grained , surly fellow -- a morose and lonely man , who consorted with nobody but himself , and an old wicker bottle which fitted into his large deep waistcoat pocket -- and who eyed each merry face , as it passed him by , with such a deep scowl of malice and ill- humour , as it was difficult to meet without feeling something the worse for . ‘
188874	189174	189175	189175	He	5280	‘ In this happy frame of mind , Gabriel strode along , returning a short , sullen growl to the good - humoured greetings of such of his neighbours as now and then passed him , until he turned into the dark lane which led to the churchyard . Now , Gabriel had been looking forward to reaching the dark lane , because it was , generally speaking , a nice , gloomy , mournful place , into which the townspeople did not much care to go , except in broad daylight , and when the sun was shining ; consequently , he was not a little indignant to hear a young urchin roaring out some jolly song about a merry Christmas , in this very sanctuary which had been called Coffin Lane ever since the days of the old abbey , and the time of the shaven - headed monks . As Gabriel walked on , and the voice drew nearer , he found it proceeded from a small boy , who was hurrying along , to join one of the little parties in the old street , and who , partly to keep himself company , and partly to prepare himself for the occasion , was shouting out the song at the highest pitch of his lungs . So Gabriel waited until the boy came up , and then dodged him into a corner , and rapped him over the head with his lantern five or six times , just to teach him to modulate his voice . And as the boy hurried away with his hand to his head , singing quite a different sort of tune , Gabriel Grub chuckled very heartily to himself , and entered the churchyard , locking the gate behind him . ‘
189401	189455	189624	189625	Gabriel Grub	553	‘ “ Ho ! ho ! ” laughed Gabriel Grub , as he sat himself down on a flat tombstone which was a favourite resting - place of his , and drew forth his wicker bottle . “ A coffin at Christmas ! A Christmas box ! Ho ! ho ! ho ! ” ‘
189473	189615	189624	189625	Gabriel Grub	553	‘ Gabriel paused , in some alarm , in the act of raising the wicker bottle to his lips , and looked round . The bottom of the oldest grave about him was not more still and quiet than the churchyard in the pale moonlight . The cold hoar frost glistened on the tombstones , and sparkled like rows of gems , among the stone carvings of the old church . The snow lay hard and crisp upon the ground ; and spread over the thickly - strewn mounds of earth , so white and smooth a cover that it seemed as if corpses lay there , hidden only by their winding sheets . Not the faintest rustle broke the profound tranquillity of the solemn scene . Sound itself appeared to be frozen up , all was so cold and still . ‘
189635	189649	189650	189650	Gabriel	553	‘ “ It was _ not _ , ” said a deep voice . ‘
189679	189895	189907	189908	the goblin	5265	‘ Seated on an upright tombstone , close to him , was a strange , unearthly figure , whom Gabriel felt at once , was no being of this world . His long , fantastic legs which might have reached the ground , were cocked up , and crossed after a quaint , fantastic fashion ; his sinewy arms were bare ; and his hands rested on his knees . On his short , round body , he wore a close covering , ornamented with small slashes ; a short cloak dangled at his back ; the collar was cut into curious peaks , which served the goblin in lieu of ruff or neckerchief ; and his shoes curled up at his toes into long points . On his head , he wore a broad - brimmed sugar - loaf hat , garnished with a single feather . The hat was covered with the white frost ; and the goblin looked as if he had sat on the same tombstone very comfortably , for two or three hundred years . He was sitting perfectly still ; his tongue was put out , as if in derision ; and he was grinning at Gabriel Grub with such a grin as only a goblin could call up . ‘
189910	189922	189907	189908	the goblin	5265	‘ Gabriel Grub was paralysed , and could make no reply . ‘
189939	189955	189935	189936	the goblin	5265	‘ “ I came to dig a grave , Sir , ” stammered Gabriel Grub . ‘
189976	190009	189973	189974	the goblin	5265	‘ “ Gabriel Grub ! Gabriel Grub ! ” screamed a wild chorus of voices that seemed to fill the churchyard . Gabriel looked fearfully round -- nothing was to be seen . ‘
190024	190066	190021	190022	the goblin	5265	‘ “ Hollands , sir , ” replied the sexton , trembling more than ever ; for he had bought it of the smugglers , and he thought that perhaps his questioner might be in the excise department of the goblins . ‘
190090	190105	190106	190107	The goblin	5265	‘ “ Gabriel Grub ! Gabriel Grub ! ” exclaimed the wild voices again . ‘
190122	190137	190118	190118	his	5265	‘ “ And who , then , is our fair and lawful prize ? ” ‘
190211	190238	190239	190240	The sexton	14046	‘ The goblin grinned a broader grin than before , as he said , “ Well , Gabriel , what do you say to this ? ” ‘
190245	190304	190239	190240	The sexton	14046	‘ “ What do you think of this , Gabriel ? ” said the goblin , kicking up his feet in the air on either side of the tombstone , and looking at the turned - up points with as much complacency as if he had been contemplating the most fashionable pair of Wellingtons in all Bond Street . ‘
190352	190366	190379	190380	the sexton	14046	‘ “ Work ! ” said the goblin , “ what work ? ” ‘
190382	190418	190379	190380	the sexton	14046	‘ “ Oh , the grave , eh ? ” said the goblin ; “ who makes graves at a time when all other men are merry , and takes a pleasure in it ? ” ‘
190433	190480	190420	190422	the mysterious voices	5308	‘ “ I am afraid my friends want you , Gabriel , ” said the goblin , thrusting his tongue farther into his cheek than ever -- and a most astonishing tongue it was--“I’m afraid my friends want you , Gabriel , ” said the goblin . ‘
190527	190617	190620	190621	the goblin	5265	‘ “ Oh , yes , they have , ” replied the goblin ; “ we know the man with the sulky face and grim scowl , that came down the street to - night , throwing his evil looks at the children , and grasping his burying - spade the tighter . We know the man who struck the boy in the envious malice of his heart , because the boy could be merry , and he could not . We know him , we know him . ” ‘
190705	190731	190738	190739	the goblin	5265	‘ “ I -- I -- am afraid I must leave you , Sir , ” said the sexton , making an effort to move . ‘
190756	190935	190738	190739	the goblin	5265	‘ As the goblin laughed , the sexton observed , for one instant , a brilliant illumination within the windows of the church , as if the whole building were lighted up ; it disappeared , the organ pealed forth a lively air , and whole troops of goblins , the very counterpart of the first one , poured into the churchyard , and began playing at leap - frog with the tombstones , never stopping for an instant to take breath , but “ overing ” the highest among them , one after the other , with the most marvellous dexterity . The first goblin was a most astonishing leaper , and none of the others could come near him ; even in the extremity of his terror the sexton could not help observing , that while his friends were content to leap over the common - sized gravestones , the first one took the family vaults , iron railings and all , with as much ease as if they had been so many street - posts . ‘
191037	191121	191013	191015	the goblin king	5322	‘ When Gabriel Grub had had time to fetch his breath , which the rapidity of his descent had for the moment taken away , he found himself in what appeared to be a large cavern , surrounded on all sides by crowds of goblins , ugly and grim ; in the centre of the room , on an elevated seat , was stationed his friend of the churchyard ; and close behind him stood Gabriel Grub himself , without power of motion . ‘
191148	191199	191216	191216	he	5265	‘ At this command , half a dozen officious goblins , with a perpetual smile upon their faces , whom Gabriel Grub imagined to be courtiers , on that account , hastily disappeared , and presently returned with a goblet of liquid fire , which they presented to the king . ‘
191241	191313	191320	191321	the king	13168	‘ It was in vain for the unfortunate sexton to protest that he was not in the habit of taking anything warm at night ; one of the goblins held him while another poured the blazing liquid down his throat ; the whole assembly screeched with laughter , as he coughed and choked , and wiped away the tears which gushed plentifully from his eyes , after swallowing the burning draught . ‘
191373	191594	191642	191643	the sexton	14046	‘ As the goblin said this , a thick cloud which obscured the remoter end of the cavern rolled gradually away , and disclosed , apparently at a great distance , a small and scantily furnished , but neat and clean apartment . A crowd of little children were gathered round a bright fire , clinging to their mother ’s gown , and gambolling around her chair . The mother occasionally rose , and drew aside the window - curtain , as if to look for some expected object ; a frugal meal was ready spread upon the table ; and an elbow chair was placed near the fire . A knock was heard at the door ; the mother opened it , and the children crowded round her , and clapped their hands for joy , as their father entered . He was wet and weary , and shook the snow from his garments , as the children crowded round him , and seizing his cloak , hat , stick , and gloves , with busy zeal , ran with them from the room . Then , as he sat down to his meal before the fire , the children climbed about his knee , and the mother sat by his side , and all seemed happiness and comfort . ‘
191752	191948	191961	191962	the goblin	5265	‘ Again the light cloud passed across the picture , and again the subject changed . The father and mother were old and helpless now , and the number of those about them was diminished more than half ; but content and cheerfulness sat on every face , and beamed in every eye , as they crowded round the fireside , and told and listened to old stories of earlier and bygone days . Slowly and peacefully , the father sank into the grave , and , soon after , the sharer of all his cares and troubles followed him to a place of rest . The few who yet survived them , kneeled by their tomb , and watered the green turf which covered it with their tears ; then rose , and turned away , sadly and mournfully , but not with bitter cries , or despairing lamentations , for they knew that they should one day meet again ; and once more they mixed with the busy world , and their content and cheerfulness were restored . The cloud settled upon the picture , and concealed it from the sexton ’s view . ‘
191972	191998	191961	191962	the goblin	5265	‘ Gabriel murmured out something about its being very pretty , and looked somewhat ashamed , as the goblin bent his fiery eyes upon him . ‘
192114	192129	192111	192111	royalty	13262	‘ “ Show him some more ! ” said the king of the goblins . ‘
192329	192389	192313	192313	Man	1398	’ ” _ You _ a miserable man ! ” said the king of the goblins , in a more contemptuous tone than before . And again the king of the goblins gave his leg a flourish ; again it descended on the shoulders of the sexton ; and again the attendant goblins imitated the example of their chief . ‘
192424	192705	192406	192407	Gabriel Grub	553	’ feet thereunto , looked on with an interest that nothing could diminish . He saw that men who worked hard , and earned their scanty bread with lives of labour , were cheerful and happy ; and that to the most ignorant , the sweet face of Nature was a never - failing source of cheerfulness and joy . He saw those who had been delicately nurtured , and tenderly brought up , cheerful under privations , and superior to suffering , that would have crushed many of a rougher grain , because they bore within their own bosoms the materials of happiness , contentment , and peace . He saw that women , the tenderest and most fragile of all God ’s creatures , were the oftenest superior to sorrow , adversity , and distress ; and he saw that it was because they bore , in their own hearts , an inexhaustible well - spring of affection and devotion . Above all , he saw that men like himself , who snarled at the mirth and cheerfulness of others , were the foulest weeds on the fair surface of the earth ; and setting all the good of the world against the evil , he came to the conclusion that it was a very decent and respectable sort of world after all . No sooner had he formed it , than the cloud which had closed over the last picture , seemed to settle on his senses , and lull him to repose . One by one , the goblins faded from his sight ; and , as the last one disappeared , he sank to sleep . ‘
192933	192989	192927	192927	his	553	‘ But he was an altered man , and he could not bear the thought of returning to a place where his repentance would be scoffed at , and his reformation disbelieved . He hesitated for a few moments ; and then turned away to wander where he might , and seek his bread elsewhere . ‘
193149	193437	193482	193482	Sam	240	‘ Unfortunately , these stories were somewhat disturbed by the unlooked- for reappearance of Gabriel Grub himself , some ten years afterwards , a ragged , contented , rheumatic old man . He told his story to the clergyman , and also to the mayor ; and in course of time it began to be received as a matter of history , in which form it has continued down to this very day . The believers in the weathercock tale , having misplaced their confidence once , were not easily prevailed upon to part with it again , so they looked as wise as they could , shrugged their shoulders , touched their foreheads , and murmured something about Gabriel Grub having drunk all the Hollands , and then fallen asleep on the flat tombstone ; and they affected to explain what he supposed he had witnessed in the goblin ’s cavern , by saying that he had seen the world , and grown wiser . But this opinion , which was by no means a popular one at any time , gradually died off ; and be the matter how it may , as Gabriel Grub was afflicted with rheumatism to the end of his days , this story has at least one moral , if it teach no better one -- and that is , that if a man turn sulky and drink by himself at Christmas time , he may make up his mind to be not a bit the better for it : let the spirits be never so good , or let them be even as many degrees beyond proof , as those which Gabriel Grub saw in the goblin ’s cavern . ’
193484	193511	193482	193482	Sam	240	’ said Mr. Pickwick , as that favoured servitor entered his bed - chamber , with his warm water , on the morning of Christmas Day , ‘
193515	193516	193482	193482	Sam	240	’ ‘

193579	193593	193595	193596	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I shall be down in a quarter of an hour , Sam , ’
193602	193608	193610	193610	Sam	240	‘ Wery good , sir , ’

193629	193639	193610	193610	Sam	240	’ exclaimed Mr. Pickwick , sitting up in bed . ‘
193643	193646	193648	193648	Sam	240	’ sawbones , ’
193650	193656	193648	193648	Sam	240	‘ What ’s a sawbones ? ’
193676	193690	193692	193693	Mr. Weller	356	‘ What ! Do n’t you know what a sawbones is , sir ? ’
193695	193707	193692	193693	Mr. Weller	356	‘ I thought everybody know’d as a sawbones was a surgeon . ’
193708	193716	193718	193719	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Oh , a surgeon , eh ? ’
193725	193731	193733	193733	Sam	240	‘ Just that , sir , ’
193735	193752	193733	193733	Sam	240	‘ These here ones as is below , though , ai n’t reg’lar thoroughbred sawbones ; they ’re

193763	193770	193772	193773	Mr. Pickwick	240	’re medical students , I suppose ? ’
193780	193787	193789	193790	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I am glad of it , ’
193800	193833	193789	193790	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ They are fine fellows -- very fine fellows ; with judgments matured by observation and reflection ; and tastes refined by reading and study . I am very glad of it . ’
193834	193836	193881	193884	one on ‘ em	14166	‘ They ’re

193863	193879	193856	193857	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ overflowing with kindly feelings and animal spirits . Just what I like to see . ’

193991	193996	193989	193989	Sam	240	’ said Mr. Pickwick . ‘
194001	194024	193997	193997	You	240	’ Sam did retire accordingly . Mr. Pickwick at the expiration of the quarter of an hour , went down to breakfast . ‘
194031	194037	194038	194038	Pickwick	240	’ said old Mr. Wardle . ‘
194074	194075	194073	194073	Mr.--	330	’ ‘
194080	194459	194076	194078	Mr. Bob Sawyer	356	’ interposed Mr. Benjamin Allen ; whereupon Mr. Bob Sawyer and Mr. Benjamin Allen laughed in concert . Mr. Pickwick bowed to Bob Sawyer , and Bob Sawyer bowed to Mr. Pickwick . Bob and his very particular friend then applied themselves most assiduously to the eatables before them ; and Mr. Pickwick had an opportunity of glancing at them both . Mr. Benjamin Allen was a coarse , stout , thick - set young man , with black hair cut rather short , and a white face cut rather long . He was embellished with spectacles , and wore a white neckerchief . Below his single - breasted black surtout , which was buttoned up to his chin , appeared the usual number of pepper - and - salt coloured legs , terminating in a pair of imperfectly polished boots . Although his coat was short in the sleeves , it disclosed no vestige of a linen wristband ; and although there was quite enough of his face to admit of the encroachment of a shirt collar , it was not graced by the smallest approach to that appendage . He presented , altogether , rather a mildewy appearance , and emitted a fragrant odour of full - flavoured Cubas . Mr. Bob Sawyer , who was habited in a coarse , blue coat , which , without being either a greatcoat or a surtout , partook of the nature and qualities of both , had about him that sort of slovenly smartness , and swaggering gait , which is peculiar to young gentlemen who smoke in the streets by day , shout and scream in the same by night , call waiters by their Christian names , and do various other acts and deeds of an equally facetious description . He wore a pair of plaid trousers , and a large , rough , double - breasted waistcoat ; out of doors , he carried a thick stick with a big top . He eschewed gloves , and looked , upon the whole , something like a dissipated Robinson Crusoe . Such were the two worthies to whom Mr. Pickwick was introduced , as he took his seat at the breakfast - table on Christmas morning . ‘
194465	194490	194463	194463	gentlemen	10163	’ said Mr. Pickwick . Mr. Bob Sawyer slightly nodded his assent to the proposition , and asked Mr. Benjamin Allen for the mustard . ‘
194500	194505	194492	194492	you	10163	’ inquired Mr. Pickwick . ‘
194511	194517	194492	194492	you	10163	’ briefly responded Mr. Allen . ‘
194526	194531	194518	194518	You	10163	’ said Mr. Pickwick . ‘
194536	194541	194492	194492	you	10163	’ replied Bob Sawyer , ‘
194560	194561	194558	194558	Ben	657	’ ‘
194564	194570	194558	194558	Ben	657	’ said Mr. Benjamin Allen ; ‘
194590	194591	194588	194588	Bob	356	’ ‘
194595	194632	194588	194588	Bob	356	’ said Bob . The particular friends resumed their attack upon the breakfast , more freely than before , as if the recollection of last night ’s supper had imparted a new relish to the meal . ‘
194638	194649	194636	194636	Bob	356	’ said Mr. Allen , to his companion , encouragingly . ‘
194654	194670	194651	194651	I	0	’ replied Bob Sawyer . And so , to do him justice , he did . ‘
194681	194697	194651	194651	I	0	’ said Mr. Bob Sawyer , looking round the table . Mr. Pickwick slightly shuddered . ‘
194704	194709	194702	194702	Bob	356	’ said Mr. Allen , ‘
194717	194718	194711	194711	you	356	’ ‘
194721	194735	194711	194711	you	356	’ replied Sawyer , helping himself to half a fowl as he spoke . ‘
194747	194751	194753	194754	Mr. Allen	657	’ Is it ? ’
194757	194760	194762	194763	Bob Sawyer	356	‘ Very , ’
194770	194784	194786	194787	Mr. Allen	657	‘ I ’ve put my name down for an arm at our place , ’
194789	194791	194786	194787	Mr. Allen	657	‘ We ’re
194825	194826	194820	194820	you	356	’ ‘
194829	194831	194832	194833	Bob Sawyer	356	’ replied ‘
194835	194842	194832	194833	Bob Sawyer	356	‘ ca n’t afford expensive luxuries . ’
194843	194846	194848	194848	Allen	657	‘ Nonsense ! ’
194850	194856	194848	194848	Allen	657	‘ Ca n’t , indeed , ’
194861	194878	194858	194859	Bob Sawyer	356	‘ I would n’t mind a brain , but I could n’t stand a whole head . ’
194887	194892	194895	194896	the ladies	10146	’ said Mr. Pickwick , ‘
194898	194924	194895	194896	the ladies	10146	’ As Mr. Pickwick spoke , the ladies , gallantly escorted by Messrs. Snodgrass , Winkle , and Tupman , returned from an early walk . ‘
194929	194949	194927	194927	Ben	657	’ said Arabella , in a tone which expressed more surprise than pleasure at the sight of her brother . ‘
194959	194968	194927	194927	Ben	657	’ replied Benjamin . Mr. Winkle turned pale . ‘
194978	195025	194971	194971	you	356	’ inquired Mr. Benjamin Allen , somewhat reproachfully . Arabella gracefully held out her hand , in acknowledgment of Bob Sawyer ’s presence . A thrill of hatred struck to Mr. Winkle ’s heart , as Bob Sawyer inflicted on the proffered hand a perceptible squeeze . ‘
195030	195036	195028	195028	dear	9784	’ said Arabella , blushing ; ‘
195048	195049	195045	195046	Mr. Winkle	276	’ ‘
195066	195316	195064	195064	Arabella	297	’ replied her brother gravely . Here Mr. Allen bowed grimly to Mr. Winkle , while Mr. Winkle and Mr. Bob Sawyer glanced mutual distrust out of the corners of their eyes . The arrival of the two new visitors , and the consequent check upon Mr. Winkle and the young lady with the fur round her boots , would in all probability have proved a very unpleasant interruption to the hilarity of the party , had not the cheerfulness of Mr. Pickwick , and the good humour of the host , been exerted to the very utmost for the common weal . Mr. Winkle gradually insinuated himself into the good graces of Mr. Benjamin Allen , and even joined in a friendly conversation with Mr. Bob Sawyer ; who , enlivened with the brandy , and the breakfast , and the talking , gradually ripened into a state of extreme facetiousness , and related with much glee an agreeable anecdote , about the removal of a tumour on some gentleman ’s head , which he illustrated by means of an oyster - knife and a half - quartern loaf , to the great edification of the assembled company . Then the whole train went to church , where Mr. Benjamin Allen fell fast asleep ; while Mr. Bob Sawyer abstracted his thoughts from worldly matters , by the ingenious process of carving his name on the seat of the pew , in corpulent letters of four inches long . ‘
195319	195347	195064	195064	Arabella	297	’ said Wardle , after a substantial lunch , with the agreeable items of strong beer and cherry - brandy , had been done ample justice to , ‘
195365	195366	195358	195358	We	5387	’ ‘
195369	195375	195358	195358	We	5387	’ said Mr. Benjamin Allen . ‘
195378	195384	195385	195385	You	5386	’ ejaculated Mr. Bob Sawyer . ‘
195393	195397	195398	195398	Ye	5386	’ said Wardle . ‘
195406	195411	195398	195398	Ye	5386	’ replied Mr. Winkle . ‘
195424	195425	195414	195414	I	0	’ ‘
195436	195440	195433	195434	Mr. Winkle	276	’ said Arabella . ‘
195449	195450	195441	195441	I	0	’ ‘

195884	195927	195882	195882	Sir	9716	’ This last observation of Mr. Weller ’s bore reference to a demonstration Mr. Winkle made at the instant , of a frantic desire to throw his feet in the air , and dash the back of his head on the ice . ‘

196117	196156	196113	196114	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ You need n’t take your hand away to do that . I meant to have given you five shillings this morning for a Christmas box , Sam . I ’ll give it you this afternoon , Sam . ’

196216	196262	196263	196263	Sam	240	’ Mr. Winkle , stooping forward , with his body half doubled up , was being assisted over the ice by Mr. Weller , in a very singular and un - swan - like manner , when Mr. Pickwick most innocently shouted from the opposite bank-- ‘

196810	196818	196791	196792	Sam Weller	356	‘ knocking at the cobbler ’s door , ’
196876	196889	196890	196890	he	240	‘ It looks a nice warm exercise that , does n’t it ? ’
196931	196939	196941	196941	Wardle	292	‘ Ah , it does , indeed , ’
196943	196948	196941	196941	Wardle	292	‘ Do you slide ? ’
196949	196966	196968	196969	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I used to do so , on the gutters , when I was a boy , ’
196971	196976	196978	196978	Wardle	292	‘ Try it now , ’
196980	196990	196992	196994	all the ladies	5415	‘ Oh , do , please , Mr. Pickwick ! ’
196996	197008	197010	197011	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I should be very happy to afford you any amusement , ’
197013	197026	197010	197011	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ but I have n’t done such a thing these thirty years . ’
197027	197034	197036	197036	Wardle	292	‘ Pooh ! pooh ! Nonsense ! ’
197051	197063	197036	197036	Wardle	292	‘ Here ; I ’ll keep you company ; come along ! ’
197162	197169	197171	197171	Sir	9716	‘ Keep the pot a - bilin ’
197173	197635	197171	197171	Sir	9716	’ said Sam ; and down went Wardle again , and then Mr. Pickwick , and then Sam , and then Mr. Winkle , and then Mr. Bob Sawyer , and then the fat boy , and then Mr. Snodgrass , following closely upon each other ’s heels , and running after each other with as much eagerness as if their future prospects in life depended on their expedition . It was the most intensely interesting thing , to observe the manner in which Mr. Pickwick performed his share in the ceremony ; to watch the torture of anxiety with which he viewed the person behind , gaining upon him at the imminent hazard of tripping him up ; to see him gradually expend the painful force he had put on at first , and turn slowly round on the slide , with his face towards the point from which he had started ; to contemplate the playful smile which mantled on his face when he had accomplished the distance , and the eagerness with which he turned round when he had done so , and ran after his predecessor , his black gaiters tripping pleasantly through the snow , and his eyes beaming cheerfulness and gladness through his spectacles . And when he was knocked down ( which happened upon the average every third round ) , it was the most invigorating sight that can possibly be imagined , to behold him gather up his hat , gloves , and handkerchief , with a glowing countenance , and resume his station in the rank , with an ardour and enthusiasm that nothing Could abate . The sport was at its height , the sliding was at the quickest , the laughter was at the loudest , when a sharp smart crack was heard . There was a quick rush towards the bank , a wild scream from the ladies , and a shout from Mr. Tupman . A large mass of ice disappeared ; the water bubbled up over it ; Mr. Pickwick ’s hat , gloves , and handkerchief were floating on the surface ; and this was all of Mr. Pickwick that anybody could see . Dismay and anguish were depicted on every countenance ; the males turned pale , and the females fainted ; Mr. Snodgrass and Mr. Winkle grasped each other by the hand , and gazed at the spot where their leader had gone down , with frenzied eagerness ; while Mr. Tupman , by way of rendering the promptest assistance , and at the same time conveying to any persons who might be within hearing , the clearest possible notion of the catastrophe , ran off across the country at his utmost speed , screaming ‘
197638	197727	197171	197171	Sir	9716	’ with all his might . It was at this moment , when old Wardle and Sam Weller were approaching the hole with cautious steps , and Mr. Benjamin Allen was holding a hurried consultation with Mr. Bob Sawyer on the advisability of bleeding the company generally , as an improving little bit of professional practice -- it was at this very moment , that a face , head , and shoulders , emerged from beneath the water , and disclosed the features and spectacles of Mr. Pickwick . ‘
197740	197745	197751	197751	me	0	’ bawled Mr. Snodgrass . ‘
197759	197811	197751	197751	me	0	’ roared Mr. Winkle , deeply affected . The adjuration was rather unnecessary ; the probability being , that if Mr. Pickwick had declined to keep himself up for anybody else ’s sake , it would have occurred to him that he might as well do so , for his own . ‘
197822	197826	197813	197813	you	5420	’ said Wardle . ‘
197831	197850	197813	197813	you	5420	’ replied Mr. Pickwick , wringing the water from his head and face , and gasping for breath . ‘
197867	197964	197967	197967	he	0	’ The clay upon so much of Mr. Pickwick ’s coat as was yet visible , bore testimony to the accuracy of this statement ; and as the fears of the spectators were still further relieved by the fat boy ’s suddenly recollecting that the water was nowhere more than five feet deep , prodigies of valour were performed to get him out . After a vast quantity of splashing , and cracking , and struggling , Mr. Pickwick was at length fairly extricated from his unpleasant position , and once more stood on dry land . ‘
197975	197979	197967	197967	he	0	’ said Emily . ‘
197984	197988	197980	197982	Dear old thing	5422	’ said Arabella . ‘
198000	198001	197997	197998	Mr. Pickwick	240	’ ‘
198013	198017	198009	198009	you	0	’ said Wardle ; ‘
198043	198623	198624	198624	I	0	’ A dozen shawls were offered on the instant . Three or four of the thickest having been selected , Mr. Pickwick was wrapped up , and started off , under the guidance of Mr. Weller ; presenting the singular phenomenon of an elderly gentleman , dripping wet , and without a hat , with his arms bound down to his sides , skimming over the ground , without any clearly - defined purpose , at the rate of six good English miles an hour . But Mr. Pickwick cared not for appearances in such an extreme case , and urged on by Sam Weller , he kept at the very top of his speed until he reached the door of Manor Farm , where Mr. Tupman had arrived some five minutes before , and had frightened the old lady into palpitations of the heart by impressing her with the unalterable conviction that the kitchen chimney was on fire -- a calamity which always presented itself in glowing colours to the old lady ’s mind , when anybody about her evinced the smallest agitation . Mr. Pickwick paused not an instant until he was snug in bed . Sam Weller lighted a blazing fire in the room , and took up his dinner ; a bowl of punch was carried up afterwards , and a grand carouse held in honour of his safety . Old Wardle would not hear of his rising , so they made the bed the chair , and Mr. Pickwick presided . A second and a third bowl were ordered in ; and when Mr. Pickwick awoke next morning , there was not a symptom of rheumatism about him ; which proves , as Mr. Bob Sawyer very justly observed , that there is nothing like hot punch in such cases ; and that if ever hot punch did fail to act as a preventive , it was merely because the patient fell into the vulgar error of not taking enough of it . The jovial party broke up next morning . Breakings - up are capital things in our school - days , but in after life they are painful enough . Death , self - interest , and fortune ’s changes , are every day breaking up many a happy group , and scattering them far and wide ; and the boys and girls never come back again . We do not mean to say that it was exactly the case in this particular instance ; all we wish to inform the reader is , that the different members of the party dispersed to their several homes ; that Mr. Pickwick and his friends once more took their seats on the top of the Muggleton coach ; and that Arabella Allen repaired to her place of destination , wherever it might have been -- we dare say Mr. Winkle knew , but we confess we don’t -- under the care and guardianship of her brother Benjamin , and his most intimate and particular friend , Mr. Bob Sawyer . Before they separated , however , that gentleman and Mr. Benjamin Allen drew Mr. Pickwick aside with an air of some mystery ; and Mr. Bob Sawyer , thrusting his forefinger between two of Mr. Pickwick ’s ribs , and thereby displaying his native drollery , and his knowledge of the anatomy of the human frame , at one and the same time , inquired-- ‘
198636	198652	198624	198624	I	0	’ Mr. Pickwick replied that he was at present suspended at the George and Vulture . ‘
198662	198667	198655	198655	you	11657	’ said Bob Sawyer . ‘
198675	198680	198655	198655	you	11657	’ replied Mr. Pickwick . ‘

199748	199754	199756	199757	the waiter	9785	‘ What name , Sir ? ’
199759	199762	199764	199765	the clerk	5485	‘ Jackson , ’
199838	199845	199847	199848	Mr. Jackson	464	‘ How de do , sir ? ’
199876	199886	199888	199889	Mr. Jackson	464	‘ I have called from Dodson and Fogg ’s , ’
199903	199921	199923	199923	he	464	‘ I refer you to my attorney , Sir ; Mr. Perker , of Gray ’s Inn , ’
199925	199933	199923	199923	he	464	‘ Waiter , show this gentleman out . ’
199934	199942	199944	199944	Jackson	464	‘ Beg your pardon , Mr. Pickwick , ’
199964	199997	199944	199944	Jackson	464	‘ But personal service , by clerk or agent , in these cases , you know , Mr. Pickwick -- nothing like caution , sir , in all legal forms -- eh ? ’
200029	200058	200011	200011	his	464	‘ Now , come ; do n’t let ’s have no words about such a little matter as this . Which of you gentlemen ’s name ’s Snodgrass ? ’
200081	200088	200090	200091	Mr. Jackson	464	‘ Ah ! I thought so , ’
200098	200111	200090	200091	Mr. Jackson	464	‘ I ’ve a little something to trouble you with , Sir . ’
200112	200115	200117	200118	Mr. Snodgrass	242	‘ Me ! ’
200120	200136	200138	200138	Jackson	464	‘ It ’s only a subpoena in Bardell and Pickwick on behalf of the plaintiff , ’
200158	200202	200208	200208	he	464	‘ It ’ll come on , in the settens after Term : fourteenth of Febooary , we expect ; we ’ve marked it a special jury cause , and it ’s only ten down the paper . That ’s yours , Mr. Snodgrass . ’
200249	200267	200241	200241	Jackson	464	‘ I think I ai n’t mistaken when I say your name ’s Tupman , am I ? ’
200294	200304	200349	200352	the dexterous Mr. Jackson	464	‘ Yes , my name is Tupman , Sir . ’
200305	200317	200319	200319	Jackson	464	‘ And that other gentleman ’s Mr. Winkle , I think ? ’
200354	200357	200359	200359	Jackson	464	‘ Now , ’
200361	200363	200359	200359	Jackson	464	‘ I ’m

200404	200441	200442	200442	I	0	’ said Mr. Pickwick . The waiter retired , considerably astonished , and Mr. Pickwick motioned Jackson to a seat . There was a painful pause , which was at length broken by the innocent defendant . ‘
200447	200483	200445	200445	Sir	9716	’ said Mr. Pickwick , his indignation rising while he spoke--‘I suppose , Sir , that it is the intention of your employers to seek to criminate me upon the testimony of my own friends ? ’
200518	200521	200487	200487	his	464	‘ Not knowin ’

200563	200572	200560	200561	Mr. Pickwick	240	’ replied Jackson , slowly shaking his head . ‘
200595	200656	200667	200668	Mr. Pickwick	240	’ Here Mr. Jackson smiled once more upon the company , and , applying his left thumb to the tip of his nose , worked a visionary coffee - mill with his right hand , thereby performing a very graceful piece of pantomime ( then much in vogue , but now , unhappily , almost obsolete ) which was familiarly denominated ‘
200661	200662	200667	200668	Mr. Pickwick	240	’ ‘
200670	200677	200667	200668	Mr. Pickwick	240	’ said Jackson , in conclusion ; ‘
200712	200756	200757	200758	Samuel Weller	356	’ Mr. Pickwick bestowed a look of excessive disgust on his unwelcome visitor , and would probably have hurled some tremendous anathema at the heads of Messrs. Dodson & amp ; Fogg , had not Sam ’s entrance at the instant interrupted him . ‘
200760	200767	200757	200758	Samuel Weller	356	’ said Mr. Jackson , inquiringly . ‘
200770	200784	200786	200786	Sam	356	’ the truest things as you ’ve said for many a long year , ’
200794	200805	200807	200807	Jackson	464	‘ Here ’s a subpoena for you , Mr. Weller , ’
200809	200816	200818	200818	Sam	356	‘ What ’s that in English ? ’

201177	201181	201169	201169	Sam	240	‘ Which way ? ’
201186	201213	201169	201169	Sam	240	’ Mr. Pickwick did not turn round immediately , but looked vacantly in Sam ’s face for a few seconds , and heaved a deep sigh . ‘

201231	201236	201229	201229	Sam	240	’ said Mr. Pickwick , ‘

202629	202634	202582	202582	He	5549	’ said Mr. Pickwick ; ‘

202664	202717	202656	202656	I	0	’ The stranger , seeming to hesitate , once more looked towards the ground , and the clerk winked slyly at Mr. Pickwick , as if to intimate that some exquisite piece of humour was going forward , though what it was Mr. Pickwick could not for the life of him divine . ‘
202724	202728	202721	202722	Mr. Pickwick	240	’ said Lowten . ‘

202767	202772	202749	202749	him	362	’ said the man ; ‘

202797	202802	202806	202807	Mr. Pickwick	240	’ replied the clerk . ‘
202828	202854	202813	202814	Mr. Watty	564	’ Seeing that the stranger still lingered , he beckoned Sam Weller to follow his master in , and shut the door in his face . ‘
202873	202889	202869	202869	I	0	’ said Lowten , throwing down his pen with the air of an injured man . ‘

203064	203091	203092	203092	They	5559	’ As the little man concluded , he took an emphatic pinch of snuff , as a tribute to the smartness of Messrs. Dodson and Fogg . ‘
203097	203102	203092	203092	They	5559	’ said Mr. Pickwick . ‘
203107	203113	203092	203092	They	5559	’ said the little man ; ‘
203165	203166	203162	203163	Serjeant Snubbin	5564	’ ‘
203173	203178	203179	203180	Good man	5566	’ inquired Mr. Pickwick . ‘
203182	203186	203188	203188	your	5561	’ replied Perker ; ‘
203249	203271	203240	203241	Serjeant Snubbin	566	’ The little man took another pinch of snuff as he made this communication , and nodded mysteriously to Mr. Pickwick . ‘
203279	203284	203272	203272	They	5572	’ said Mr. Pickwick . ‘
203292	203296	203289	203289	they	5572	’ replied Perker . ‘
203307	203308	203289	203289	they	5572	’ ‘
203317	203322	203323	203323	She	5575	’ said Mr. Pickwick . ‘
203330	203331	203325	203325	herself	5575	’ ‘
203339	203343	203325	203325	herself	5575	’ replied Perker ; ‘
203367	203368	203369	203369	They	5572	’ ‘
203377	203398	203399	203399	Sam	240	’ said Mr. Pickwick , quitting the other point ; for there Mr. Perker ’s question had somewhat staggered him . ‘
203401	203412	203399	203399	Sam	240	’ said Perker . Mr. Pickwick replied in the affirmative . ‘
203475	203498	203468	203468	you	9716	’ Here Mr. Perker drew himself up with conscious dignity , and brushed some stray grains of snuff from his shirt frill . ‘
203508	203518	203468	203468	you	9716	’ asked Mr. Pickwick , after two or three minutes ’
203521	203542	203544	203544	Perker	362	‘ That you sent him up to the plaintiff ‘s to make some offer of a compromise , I suppose , ’
203546	203572	203544	203544	Perker	362	‘ It do n’t matter much , though ; I do n’t think many counsel could get a great deal out of _ him _ . ’
203573	203581	203583	203584	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I do n’t think they could , ’
203603	203610	203544	203544	Perker	362	‘ What course do we pursue ? ’
203611	203623	203625	203625	Perker	362	‘ We have only one to adopt , my dear Sir , ’
203627	203655	203625	203625	Perker	362	‘ cross - examine the witnesses ; trust to Snubbin ’s eloquence ; throw dust in the eyes of the judge ; throw ourselves on the jury . ’
203656	203665	203667	203668	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ And suppose the verdict is against me ? ’
203695	203708	203710	203711	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ You mean that in that case I must pay the damages ? ’
203735	203741	203723	203723	Perker	362	‘ I am afraid so . ’
203742	203759	203761	203762	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Then I beg to announce to you my unalterable determination to pay no damages whatever , ’
203767	203803	203761	203762	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ None , Perker . Not a pound , not a penny of my money , shall find its way into the pockets of Dodson and Fogg . That is my deliberate and irrevocable determination . ’
203825	203836	203838	203838	Perker	362	‘ Very well , my dear Sir , very well , ’
203840	203848	203838	203838	Perker	362	‘ You know best , of course . ’
203849	203853	203855	203856	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Of course , ’
203859	203866	203855	203856	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Where does Serjeant Snubbin live ? ’
203874	203878	203855	203856	Mr. Pickwick	240	’ replied Perker . ‘
203886	203891	203879	203879	I	0	’ said Mr. Pickwick . ‘
203900	203908	203898	203898	Sir	9716	’ rejoined Perker , in utter amazement . ‘
203967	204140	203957	203959	my dear Sir	1228	’ Mr. Pickwick , however , had made up his mind not only that it could be done , but that it should be done ; and the consequence was , that within ten minutes after he had received the assurance that the thing was impossible , he was conducted by his solicitor into the outer office of the great Serjeant Snubbin himself . It was an uncarpeted room of tolerable dimensions , with a large writing- table drawn up near the fire , the baize top of which had long since lost all claim to its original hue of green , and had gradually grown gray with dust and age , except where all traces of its natural colour were obliterated by ink - stains . Upon the table were numerous little bundles of papers tied with red tape ; and behind it , sat an elderly clerk , whose sleek appearance and heavy gold watch - chain presented imposing indications of the extensive and lucrative practice of Mr. Serjeant Snubbin . ‘
204151	204163	204166	204166	he	5592	’ inquired Perker , offering his box with all imaginable courtesy . ‘
204169	204174	204166	204166	he	5592	’ was the reply , ‘
204205	204208	204213	204213	he	5485	‘ em . ’
204242	204248	204250	204250	Perker	362	‘ Something like practice that , ’
204252	204255	204263	204263	his	5596	‘ Yes , ’
204275	204315	204263	204263	his	5596	‘ and the best of it is , that as nobody alive except myself can read the serjeant ’s writing , they are obliged to wait for the opinions , when he has given them , till I have copied ‘
204324	204325	204263	204263	his	5596	’ ‘
204350	204354	204263	204263	his	5596	’ said Perker ; ‘
204361	204419	204263	204263	his	5596	’ At this the serjeant ’s clerk laughed again -- not a noisy boisterous laugh , but a silent , internal chuckle , which Mr. Pickwick disliked to hear . When a man bleeds inwardly , it is a dangerous thing for himself ; but when he laughs inwardly , it bodes no good to other people . ‘
204434	204442	204444	204444	Perker	362	’m in your debt , have you ? ’
204446	204453	204455	204456	the clerk	5485	‘ No , I have not , ’
204458	204464	204466	204466	Perker	362	‘ I wish you would , ’
204468	204486	204466	204466	Perker	362	‘ Let me have them , and I ’ll send you a cheque . But I suppose you ’re
204508	204530	204466	204466	Perker	362	’ This sally seemed to tickle the clerk amazingly , and he once more enjoyed a little quiet laugh to himself . ‘
204540	204568	204533	204534	Mr. Mallard	567	’ said Perker , suddenly recovering his gravity , and drawing the great man ’s great man into a Corner , by the lappel of his coat ; ‘
204583	204584	204572	204573	the Serjeant	5592	’ ‘
204589	204594	204602	204603	the Serjeant	5592	’ said the clerk , ‘
204612	205085	205086	205087	Mr. Pickwick	240	’ Notwithstanding the absurdity of the proposal , however , the clerk allowed himself to be gently drawn beyond the hearing of Mr. Pickwick ; and after a short conversation conducted in whispers , walked softly down a little dark passage , and disappeared into the legal luminary ’s sanctum , whence he shortly returned on tiptoe , and informed Mr. Perker and Mr. Pickwick that the Serjeant had been prevailed upon , in violation of all established rules and customs , to admit them at once . Mr. Serjeant Snubbins was a lantern - faced , sallow - complexioned man , of about five - and - forty , or -- as the novels say -- he might be fifty . He had that dull - looking , boiled eye which is often to be seen in the heads of people who have applied themselves during many years to a weary and laborious course of study ; and which would have been sufficient , without the additional eyeglass which dangled from a broad black riband round his neck , to warn a stranger that he was very near - sighted . His hair was thin and weak , which was partly attributable to his having never devoted much time to its arrangement , and partly to his having worn for five- and - twenty years the forensic wig which hung on a block beside him . The marks of hairpowder on his coat - collar , and the ill - washed and worse tied white neckerchief round his throat , showed that he had not found leisure since he left the court to make any alteration in his dress ; while the slovenly style of the remainder of his costume warranted the inference that his personal appearance would not have been very much improved if he had . Books of practice , heaps of papers , and opened letters , were scattered over the table , without any attempt at order or arrangement ; the furniture of the room was old and rickety ; the doors of the book - case were rotting in their hinges ; the dust flew out from the carpet in little clouds at every step ; the blinds were yellow with age and dirt ; the state of everything in the room showed , with a clearness not to be mistaken , that Mr. Serjeant Snubbin was far too much occupied with his professional pursuits to take any great heed or regard of his personal comforts . The Serjeant was writing when his clients entered ; he bowed abstractedly when Mr. Pickwick was introduced by his solicitor ; and then , motioning them to a seat , put his pen carefully in the inkstand , nursed his left leg , and waited to be spoken to . ‘
205099	205103	205096	205097	Serjeant Snubbin	566	’ said Perker . ‘
205113	205118	205119	205119	You	0	’ said the Serjeant . ‘
205124	205140	205141	205142	Mr. Pickwick	240	’ replied Perker . The Serjeant nodded his head , and waited for something else . ‘
205153	205157	205150	205151	Serjeant Snubbin	566	’ said Perker , ‘
205238	205249	205231	205231	I	0	’ said the little man , turning to Mr. Pickwick . ‘
205253	205299	205231	205231	I	0	’ replied that gentleman . Mr. Serjeant Snubbin unfolded his glasses , raised them to his eyes ; and , after looking at Mr. Pickwick for a few seconds with great curiosity , turned to Mr. Perker , and said , smiling slightly as he spoke-- ‘
205307	205314	205301	205302	Mr. Pickwick	240	’ The attorney shrugged his shoulders . ‘
205321	205322	205316	205316	you	0	’ ‘
205325	205432	205316	205316	you	0	’ The smile on the Serjeant ’s countenance became more defined ; he rocked his leg with increased violence ; and , throwing himself back in his easy- chair , coughed dubiously . These tokens of the Serjeant ’s presentiments on the subject , slight as they were , were not lost on Mr. Pickwick . He settled the spectacles , through which he had attentively regarded such demonstrations of the barrister ’s feelings as he had permitted himself to exhibit , more firmly on his nose ; and said with great energy , and in utter disregard of all Mr. Perker ’s admonitory winkings and frownings-- ‘
205477	205495	205496	205499	Gentlemen of your profession	5615	’ The Serjeant tried to look gravely at the fire , but the smile came back again . ‘
205503	205508	205496	205499	Gentlemen of your profession	5615	’ continued Mr. Pickwick , ‘
205760	205834	205742	205742	I	0	’ Long before the close of this address , which we are bound to say was of a very prosy character for Mr. Pickwick , the Serjeant had relapsed into a state of abstraction . After some minutes , however , during which he had reassumed his pen , he appeared to be again aware of the presence of his clients ; raising his head from the paper , he said , rather snappishly-- ‘
205843	205844	205845	205846	Mr. Phunky	569	’ ‘
205851	205856	205857	205857	Phunky	569	’ replied the attorney . ‘
205861	205866	205857	205857	Phunky	569	’ said the Serjeant , ‘
205882	205883	205874	205874	He	569	’ ‘
205893	205898	205888	205891	a very young man	5624	’ replied the attorney . ‘
205922	205923	205911	205911	he	569	’ ‘
205930	205954	205926	205926	I	0	’ said the Serjeant , in that sort of pitying tone in which ordinary folks would speak of a very helpless little child . ‘
205962	205972	205974	205974	Perker	362	’ Phunky’s -- Holborn Court , Gray ’s Inn , ’
206006	206080	205998	205998	he	569	’ Mr. Mallard departed to execute his commission ; and Serjeant Snubbin relapsed into abstraction until Mr. Phunky himself was introduced . Although an infant barrister , he was a full - grown man . He had a very nervous manner , and a painful hesitation in his speech ; it did not appear to be a natural defect , but seemed rather the result of timidity , arising from the consciousness of being ‘
206083	206118	206119	206119	I	0	’ by want of means , or interest , or connection , or impudence , as the case might be . He was overawed by the Serjeant , and profoundly courteous to the attorney . ‘
206133	206179	206130	206131	Mr. Phunky	569	’ said Serjeant Snubbin , with haughty condescension . Mr. Phunky bowed . He _ had _ had the pleasure of seeing the Serjeant , and of envying him too , with all a poor man ’s envy , for eight years and a quarter . ‘
206191	206281	206180	206180	You	569	’ said the Serjeant . If Mr. Phunky had been a rich man , he would have instantly sent for his clerk to remind him ; if he had been a wise one , he would have applied his forefinger to his forehead , and endeavoured to recollect , whether , in the multiplicity of his engagements , he had undertaken this one or not ; but as he was neither rich nor wise ( in this sense , at all events ) he turned red , and bowed . ‘
206291	206372	206283	206283	you	569	’ inquired the Serjeant . Here again , Mr. Phunky should have professed to have forgotten all about the merits of the case ; but as he had read such papers as had been laid before him in the course of the action , and had thought of nothing else , waking or sleeping , throughout the two months during which he had been retained as Mr. Serjeant Snubbin ’s junior , he turned a deeper red and bowed again . ‘
206378	206423	206375	206376	Mr. Pickwick	240	’ said the Serjeant , waving his pen in the direction in which that gentleman was standing . Mr. Phunky bowed to Mr. Pickwick , with a reverence which a first client must ever awaken ; and again inclined his head towards his leader . ‘
206432	206437	206425	206425	you	569	’ said the Serjeant , ‘
206461	206730	206452	206452	We	5629	’ With that hint that he had been interrupted quite long enough , Mr. Serjeant Snubbin , who had been gradually growing more and more abstracted , applied his glass to his eyes for an instant , bowed slightly round , and was once more deeply immersed in the case before him , which arose out of an interminable lawsuit , originating in the act of an individual , deceased a century or so ago , who had stopped up a pathway leading from some place which nobody ever came from , to some other place which nobody ever went to . Mr. Phunky would not hear of passing through any door until Mr. Pickwick and his solicitor had passed through before him , so it was some time before they got into the Square ; and when they did reach it , they walked up and down , and held a long conference , the result of which was , that it was a very difficult matter to say how the verdict would go ; that nobody could presume to calculate on the issue of an action ; that it was very lucky they had prevented the other party from getting Serjeant Snubbin ; and other topics of doubt and consolation , common in such a position of affairs . Mr. Weller was then roused by his master from a sweet sleep of an hour ’s duration ; and , bidding adieu to Lowten , they returned to the city . CHAPTER XXXII . DESCRIBES , FAR MORE FULLY THAN THE COURT NEWSMAN EVER DID , A BACHELOR ’S
207360	207394	207353	207353	he	657	‘ Well , it is unlucky she should have taken it in her head to turn sour , just on this occasion . She might at least have waited till to - morrow . ’
207395	207406	207408	207410	Mr. Bob Sawyer	356	‘ That ’s her malevolence -- that ’s her malevolence , ’
207413	207439	207408	207410	Mr. Bob Sawyer	356	‘ She says that if I can afford to give a party I ought to be able to pay her confounded “ little bill . ” ’
207447	207493	207353	207353	he	657	’ inquired Mr. Ben Allen . A bill , by the bye , is the most extraordinary locomotive engine that the genius of man ever produced . It would keep on running during the longest lifetime , without ever once stopping of its own accord . ‘
207504	207529	207353	207353	he	657	’ replied Mr. Bob Sawyer . Ben Allen coughed hopelessly , and directed a searching look between the two top bars of the stove . ‘
207558	207566	207538	207538	she	5675	’ said Mr. Ben Allen at length . ‘
207569	207574	207538	207538	she	5675	’ replied Bob Sawyer , ‘
207577	207639	207538	207538	she	5675	’ A low tap was heard at the room door . Mr. Bob Sawyer looked expressively at his friend , and bade the tapper come in ; whereupon a dirty , slipshod girl in black cotton stockings , who might have passed for the neglected daughter of a superannuated dustman in very reduced circumstances , thrust in her head , and said-- ‘
207653	207710	207645	207646	Missis Raddle	572	’ Before Mr. Bob Sawyer could return any answer , the girl suddenly disappeared with a jerk , as if somebody had given her a violent pull behind ; this mysterious exit was no sooner accomplished , than there was another tap at the door -- a smart , pointed tap , which seemed to say , ‘
207718	207721	207722	207724	Mr. Bob Sawyer	356	’m coming . ’
207741	207745	207795	207799	the little , fierce woman	5680	‘ Come in . ’
207787	207793	207795	207799	the little , fierce woman	5680	‘ Now , Mr. Sawyer , ’
207807	207847	207795	207799	the little , fierce woman	5680	‘ if you ’ll have the kindness to settle that little bill of mine I ’ll thank you , because I ’ve got my rent to pay this afternoon , and my landlord ’s a - waiting below now . ’
207872	207887	207889	207890	Bob Sawyer	356	‘ I am very sorry to put you to any inconvenience , Mrs. Raddle , ’
207893	207895	207889	207890	Bob Sawyer	356	‘ but-- ’
207896	207905	207907	207909	the little woman	5681	‘ Oh , it is n’t any inconvenience , ’
207916	207988	207907	207909	the little woman	5681	‘ I did n’t want it particular before to - day ; leastways , as it has to go to my landlord directly , it was as well for you to keep it as me . You promised me this afternoon , Mr. Sawyer , and every gentleman as has ever lived here , has kept his word , Sir , as of course anybody as calls himself a gentleman does . ’
208039	208045	208037	208037	she	573	‘ getting the steam up . ’
208046	208055	208057	208058	Bob Sawyer	356	‘ I am very sorry , Mrs. Raddle , ’
208065	208083	208057	208058	Bob Sawyer	356	‘ but the fact is , that I have been disappointed in the City to - day . ’--Extraordinary
208101	208107	208109	208110	Mrs. Raddle	573	‘ Well , Mr. Sawyer , ’
208124	208134	208109	208110	Mrs. Raddle	573	‘ and what ’s that to me , Sir ? ’
208135	208147	208149	208150	Bob Sawyer	356	‘ I -- I -- have no doubt , Mrs. Raddle , ’
208157	208186	208149	208150	Bob Sawyer	356	‘ that before the middle of next week we shall be able to set ourselves quite square , and go on , on a better system , afterwards . ’

208284	208423	208272	208272	her	573	’m a - going day after day to let a fellar occupy my lodgings as never thinks of paying his rent , nor even the very money laid out for the fresh butter and lump sugar that ’s bought for his breakfast , and the very milk that ’s took in , at the street door ? Do you suppose a hard - working and industrious woman as has lived in this street for twenty year ( ten year over the way , and nine year and three - quarters in this very house ) has nothing else to do but to work herself to death after a parcel of lazy idle fellars , that are always smoking and drinking , and lounging , when they ought to be glad to turn their hands to anything that would help ‘

208438	208445	208431	208431	you--	5691	’ interposed Mr. Benjamin Allen soothingly . ‘
208461	208486	208458	208458	I	0	’ said Mrs. Raddle , suddenly arresting the rapid torrent of her speech , and addressing the third party with impressive slowness and solemnity . ‘
208519	208520	208517	208517	Sir	9716	’ ‘
208528	208534	208517	208517	Sir	9716	’ said Mr. Benjamin Allen . ‘
208540	208549	208538	208538	Sir	9716	’ responded Mrs. Raddle , with lofty politeness . ‘
208597	208598	208587	208588	some persons	5702	’ ‘
208607	208613	208600	208600	you	5689	’ remonstrated Mr. Benjamin Allen . ‘
208622	208634	208614	208614	I	0	’ said Mrs. Raddle , in a cold perspiration of anger . ‘
208650	208651	208637	208637	you	9716	’ ‘
208667	208681	208652	208652	I	0	’ replied Mr. Benjamin Allen , growing somewhat uneasy on his own account . ‘
208690	208703	208682	208682	I	0	’ demanded Mrs. Raddle , in a louder and more imperative tone . ‘
208722	208723	208713	208713	you	9716	’ ‘
208730	208736	208713	208713	you	9716	’ said Mr. Benjamin Allen . ‘
208752	208767	208738	208738	you	9716	’ interrupted Mrs. Raddle , with intense fierceness , throwing the door wide open . ‘
208775	208781	208772	208772	I	0	’ replied Mr. Benjamin Allen . ‘
208789	208820	208786	208786	you	9716	’ said Mrs. Raddle , backing gradually to the door , and raising her voice to its loudest pitch , for the special behoof of Mr. Raddle in the kitchen . ‘
208840	208953	208786	208786	you	9716	‘ ouse while my husband sits sleeping downstairs , and taking no more notice than if I was a dog in the streets . He ought to be ashamed of himself ( here Mrs. Raddle sobbed ) to allow his wife to be treated in this way by a parcel of young cutters and carvers of live people ’s bodies , that disgraces the lodgings ( another sob ) , and leaving her exposed to all manner of abuse ; a base , faint - hearted , timorous wretch , that ’s afraid to come upstairs , and face the ruffinly creatures -- that ’s afraid -- that ’s afraid to come ! ’
209062	209069	209071	209072	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Does Mr. Sawyer live here ? ’
209080	209083	209085	209086	the girl	9813	‘ Yes , ’
209088	209110	209085	209086	the girl	9813	‘ first floor . It ’s the door straight afore you , when you gets to the top of the stairs . ’
209218	209223	209225	209227	the discomfited student	5721	‘ How are you ? ’
209229	209241	209225	209227	the discomfited student	5721	‘ Glad to see you -- take care of the glasses . ’
209259	209263	209265	209266	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Dear me , ’
209268	209274	209265	209266	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I beg your pardon . ’
209275	209286	209288	209289	Bob Sawyer	356	‘ Do n’t mention it , do n’t mention it , ’
209291	209293	209288	209289	Bob Sawyer	356	‘ I ’m
209331	209361	209321	209321	You	240	’ Mr. Pickwick shook hands with Mr. Benjamin Allen , and his friends followed his example . They had scarcely taken their seats when there was another double knock . ‘
209369	209375	209366	209367	Jack Hopkins	576	’ said Mr. Bob Sawyer . ‘
209391	209434	209435	209435	You	576	’ A heavy footstep was heard upon the stairs , and Jack Hopkins presented himself . He wore a black velvet waistcoat , with thunder - and - lightning buttons ; and a blue striped shirt , with a white false collar . ‘
209436	209441	209443	209445	Mr. Benjamin Allen	657	’re late , Jack ? ’
209447	209454	209456	209456	Hopkins	576	‘ Been detained at Bartholomew ’s , ’
209458	209462	209456	209456	Hopkins	576	‘ Anything new ? ’
209463	209479	209435	209435	You	576	‘ No , nothing particular . Rather a good accident brought into the casualty ward . ’
209480	209487	209489	209490	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ What was that , sir ? ’
209492	209504	209489	209490	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Only a man fallen out of a four pair of stairs ’
209516	209517	209435	209435	You	576	’ ‘
209532	209537	209519	209519	you	240	’ inquired Mr. Pickwick . ‘
209540	209546	209519	209519	you	240	’ replied Mr. Hopkins carelessly . ‘
209576	209577	209578	209578	You	240	’ ‘
209586	209591	209582	209584	a good operator	5728	’ said Mr. Pickwick . ‘
209595	209599	209592	209593	Best alive	5729	’ replied Hopkins . ‘
209655	209656	209644	209644	he	5731	’ ‘
209660	209667	209644	209644	he	5731	’ said Mr. Pickwick , astonished . ‘
209678	209683	209687	209687	Bob	356	’ said Jack Hopkins . ‘
209689	209690	209687	209687	Bob	356	’ ‘
209695	209701	209687	209687	Bob	356	’ replied Mr. Bob Sawyer . ‘
209708	209724	209706	209706	Bob	356	’ said Hopkins , with a scarcely perceptible glance at Mr. Pickwick ’s attentive face , ‘
209745	209746	209733	209734	A child	1756	’ ‘
209752	209757	209750	209750	Sir	9716	’ interrupted Mr. Pickwick . ‘
209761	209766	209750	209750	Sir	9716	’ replied Jack Hopkins . ‘
209801	209892	209900	209901	Mr. Pickwick	240	’ Mr. Hopkins appeared highly gratified with his own pleasantry , and continued--‘No , the way was this . Child ’s parents were poor people who lived in a court . Child ’s eldest sister bought a necklace -- common necklace , made of large black wooden beads . Child being fond of toys , cribbed the necklace , hid it , played with it , cut the string , and swallowed a bead . Child thought it capital fun , went back next day , and swallowed another bead . ’
209893	209898	209900	209901	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Bless my heart , ’
209903	209919	209900	209901	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ what a dreadful thing ! I beg your pardon , Sir . Go on . ’
209920	210305	210307	210308	Jack Hopkins	576	‘ Next day , child swallowed two beads ; the day after that , he treated himself to three , and so on , till in a week ’s time he had got through the necklace -- five - and - twenty beads in all . The sister , who was an industrious girl , and seldom treated herself to a bit of finery , cried her eyes out , at the loss of the necklace ; looked high and low for it ; but , I need n’t say , did n’t find it . A few days afterwards , the family were at dinner -- baked shoulder of mutton , and potatoes under it -- the child , who was n’t hungry , was playing about the room , when suddenly there was heard a devil of a noise , like a small hailstorm . “ Do n’t do that , my boy , ” said the father . “ I ai n’t a - doin’ nothing , ” said the child . “ Well , do n’t do it again , ” said the father . There was a short silence , and then the noise began again , worse than ever . “ If you do n’t mind what I say , my boy , ” said the father , “ you ’ll find yourself in bed , in something less than a pig ’s whisper . ” He gave the child a shake to make him obedient , and such a rattling ensued as nobody ever heard before . “ Why , damme , it ’s _ in _ the child ! ” said the father , “ he ’s got the croup in the wrong place ! ” “ No , I have n’t , father , ” said the child , beginning to cry , “ it ’s the necklace ; I swallowed it , father . ”--The father caught the child up , and ran with him to the hospital ; the beads in the boy ’s stomach rattling all the way with the jolting ; and the people looking up in the air , and down in the cellars , to see where the unusual sound came from . He ’s in the hospital now , ’
210310	210327	210307	210308	Jack Hopkins	576	‘ and he makes such a devil of a noise when he walks about , that they ’re
210346	210347	210340	210340	he	5739	’ ‘
210359	210372	210340	210340	he	5739	’ said Mr. Pickwick , with an emphatic blow on the table . ‘
210379	210384	210340	210340	he	5739	’ said Jack Hopkins . ‘
210390	210391	210388	210388	Bob	356	’ ‘
210395	210400	210388	210388	Bob	356	’ replied Bob Sawyer . ‘
210416	210420	210414	210414	Sir	9716	’ said Hopkins . ‘
210429	210615	210414	210414	Sir	9716	’ replied Mr. Pickwick . Another knock at the door announced a large - headed young man in a black wig , who brought with him a scorbutic youth in a long stock . The next comer was a gentleman in a shirt emblazoned with pink anchors , who was closely followed by a pale youth with a plated watchguard . The arrival of a prim personage in clean linen and cloth boots rendered the party complete . The little table with the green baize cover was wheeled out ; the first instalment of punch was brought in , in a white jug ; and the succeeding three hours were devoted to _ Vingt - et - un _ at sixpence a dozen , which was only once interrupted by a slight dispute between the scorbutic youth and the gentleman with the pink anchors ; in the course of which , the scorbutic youth intimated a burning desire to pull the nose of the gentleman with the emblems of hope ; in reply to which , that individual expressed his decided unwillingness to accept of any ‘
210617	210647	210388	210388	Bob	356	’ on gratuitous terms , either from the irascible young gentleman with the scorbutic countenance , or any other person who was ornamented with a head . When the last ‘
210649	211282	210414	210414	Sir	9716	’ had been declared , and the profit and loss account of fish and sixpences adjusted , to the satisfaction of all parties , Mr. Bob Sawyer rang for supper , and the visitors squeezed themselves into corners while it was getting ready . It was not so easily got ready as some people may imagine . First of all , it was necessary to awaken the girl , who had fallen asleep with her face on the kitchen table ; this took a little time , and , even when she did answer the bell , another quarter of an hour was consumed in fruitless endeavours to impart to her a faint and distant glimmering of reason . The man to whom the order for the oysters had been sent , had not been told to open them ; it is a very difficult thing to open an oyster with a limp knife and a two - pronged fork ; and very little was done in this way . Very little of the beef was done either ; and the ham ( which was also from the German - sausage shop round the corner ) was in a similar predicament . However , there was plenty of porter in a tin can ; and the cheese went a great way , for it was very strong . So upon the whole , perhaps , the supper was quite as good as such matters usually are . After supper , another jug of punch was put upon the table , together with a paper of cigars , and a couple of bottles of spirits . Then there was an awful pause ; and this awful pause was occasioned by a very common occurrence in this sort of place , but a very embarrassing one notwithstanding . The fact is , the girl was washing the glasses . The establishment boasted four : we do not record the circumstance as at all derogatory to Mrs. Raddle , for there never was a lodging - house yet , that was not short of glasses . The landlady ’s glasses were little , thin , blown - glass tumblers , and those which had been borrowed from the public - house were great , dropsical , bloated articles , each supported on a huge gouty leg . This would have been in itself sufficient to have possessed the company with the real state of affairs ; but the young woman of all work had prevented the possibility of any misconception arising in the mind of any gentleman upon the subject , by forcibly dragging every man ’s glass away , long before he had finished his beer , and audibly stating , despite the winks and interruptions of Mr. Bob Sawyer , that it was to be conveyed downstairs , and washed forthwith . It is a very ill wind that blows nobody any good . The prim man in the cloth boots , who had been unsuccessfully attempting to make a joke during the whole time the round game lasted , saw his opportunity , and availed himself of it . The instant the glasses disappeared , he commenced a long story about a great public character , whose name he had forgotten , making a particularly happy reply to another eminent and illustrious individual whom he had never been able to identify . He enlarged at some length and with great minuteness upon divers collateral circumstances , distantly connected with the anecdote in hand , but for the life of him he could n’t recollect at that precise moment what the anecdote was , although he had been in the habit of telling the story with great applause for the last ten years . ‘
211286	211296	210414	210414	Sir	9716	’ said the prim man in the cloth boots , ‘
211304	211305	210414	210414	Sir	9716	’ ‘
211314	211337	211306	211306	I	0	’ said Mr. Bob Sawyer , glancing eagerly at the door , as he thought he heard the noise of glasses jingling ; ‘
211341	211342	211306	211306	I	0	’ ‘
211347	211353	211345	211345	I	0	’ responded the prim man , ‘
211388	211493	211496	211496	Betsy	366	’ The prim man arrived at this point just as the glasses came back , when Mr. Bob Sawyer , who had been absorbed in attention during the whole time , said he should very much like to hear the end of it , for , so far as it went , it was , without exception , the very best story he had ever heard . The sight of the tumblers restored Bob Sawyer to a degree of equanimity which he had not possessed since his interview with his landlady . His face brightened up , and he began to feel quite convivial . ‘
211498	211548	211496	211496	Betsy	366	’ said Mr. Bob Sawyer , with great suavity , and dispersing , at the same time , the tumultuous little mob of glasses the girl had collected in the centre of the table--‘now , Betsy , the warm water ; be brisk , there ’s a good girl . ’
211549	211558	211560	211560	Betsy	366	‘ You ca n’t have no warm water , ’
211562	211567	211569	211571	Mr. Bob Sawyer	356	‘ No warm water ! ’
211573	211576	211578	211579	the girl	9813	‘ No , ’
211602	211612	211578	211579	the girl	9813	‘ Missis Raddle said you warn’t to have none . ’
211629	211639	211641	211643	Mr. Bob Sawyer	356	‘ Bring up the warm water instantly -- instantly ! ’
211649	211656	211658	211659	the girl	9813	‘ No . I ca n’t , ’
211661	211681	211658	211659	the girl	9813	‘ Missis Raddle raked out the kitchen fire afore she went to bed , and locked up the kittle . ’
211682	211701	211703	211704	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Oh , never mind ; never mind . Pray do n’t disturb yourself about such a trifle , ’
211721	211729	211703	211704	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ cold water will do very well . ’
211730	211735	211737	211739	Mr. Benjamin Allen	657	‘ Oh , admirably , ’
211741	211754	211737	211739	Mr. Benjamin Allen	657	‘ My landlady is subject to some slight attacks of mental derangement , ’
211764	211773	211756	211757	Bob Sawyer	356	‘ I fear I must give her warning . ’
211774	211780	211782	211783	Ben Allen	657	‘ No , do n’t , ’
211785	211791	211793	211793	Bob	356	‘ I fear I must , ’
211799	211818	211793	211793	Bob	356	‘ I ’ll pay her what I owe her , and give her warning to - morrow morning . ’
211953	211956	211958	211960	the scorbutic youth	14486	‘ Sawyer , ’
211967	211972	211974	211976	Mr. Bob Sawyer	356	‘ Well , Noddy , ’
211978	211987	211989	211990	Mr. Noddy	580	‘ I should be very sorry , Sawyer , ’
211992	212028	211989	211990	Mr. Noddy	580	‘ to create any unpleasantness at any friend ’s table , and much less at yours , Sawyer-- very ; but I must take this opportunity of informing Mr. Gunter that he is no gentleman . ’
212029	212051	212053	212054	Mr. Gunter	582	‘ And I should be very sorry , Sawyer , to create any disturbance in the street in which you reside , ’
212056	212059	212053	212054	Mr. Gunter	582	‘ but I ’m

212086	212096	212098	212099	Mr. Noddy	580	‘ What do you mean by that , sir ? ’
212101	212108	212110	212111	Mr. Gunter	582	‘ What I say , Sir , ’
212113	212125	212127	212128	Mr. Noddy	580	‘ I should like to see you do it , Sir , ’
212130	212146	212148	212149	Mr. Gunter	582	‘ You shall _ feel _ me do it in half a minute , Sir , ’
212151	212165	212167	212168	Mr. Noddy	580	‘ I request that you ’ll favour me with your card , Sir , ’
212170	212181	212183	212184	Mr. Gunter	582	‘ I ’ll do nothing of the kind , Sir , ’
212186	212192	212194	212195	Mr. Noddy	580	‘ Why not , Sir ? ’
212197	212229	212231	212232	Mr. Gunter	582	‘ Because you ’ll stick it up over your chimney - piece , and delude your visitors into the false belief that a gentleman has been to see you , Sir , ’
212234	212249	212251	212252	Mr. Noddy	580	‘ Sir , a friend of mine shall wait on you in the morning , ’
212254	212258	212251	212252	Mr. Noddy	580	‘ Sir , I ’m
212283	212507	212269	212269	I	0	’ replied Mr. Gunter . At this point the remainder of the guests interposed , and remonstrated with both parties on the impropriety of their conduct ; on which Mr. Noddy begged to state that his father was quite as respectable as Mr. Gunter ’s father ; to which Mr. Gunter replied that his father was to the full as respectable as Mr. Noddy ’s father , and that his father ’s son was as good a man as Mr. Noddy , any day in the week . As this announcement seemed the prelude to a recommencement of the dispute , there was another interference on the part of the company ; and a vast quantity of talking and clamouring ensued , in the course of which Mr. Noddy gradually allowed his feelings to overpower him , and professed that he had ever entertained a devoted personal attachment towards Mr. Gunter . To this Mr. Gunter replied that , upon the whole , he rather preferred Mr. Noddy to his own brother ; on hearing which admission , Mr. Noddy magnanimously rose from his seat , and proffered his hand to Mr. Gunter . Mr. Gunter grasped it with affecting fervour ; and everybody said that the whole dispute had been conducted in a manner which was highly honourable to both parties concerned . ‘
212510	212515	212269	212269	I	0	’ said Jack Hopkins , ‘
212533	212548	212549	212550	The King	13168	’ And Hopkins , incited thereto by tumultuous applause , plunged himself at once into ‘
212556	212574	212549	212550	The King	13168	’ which he sang as loud as he could , to a novel air , compounded of the ‘
212579	212581	212549	212550	The King	13168	’ and ‘
212587	212652	212584	212584	he	13168	’ The chorus was the essence of the song ; and , as each gentleman sang it to the tune he knew best , the effect was very striking indeed . It was at the end of the chorus to the first verse , that Mr. Pickwick held up his hand in a listening attitude , and said , as soon as silence was restored-- ‘
212669	212686	212664	212664	somebody	9931	’ A profound silence immediately ensued ; and Mr. Bob Sawyer was observed to turn pale . ‘
212694	212699	212664	212664	somebody	9931	’ said Mr. Pickwick . ‘
212708	212724	212725	212726	Mr. Sawyer	356	’ The door was no sooner opened than all doubt on the subject was removed . ‘
212731	212742	212728	212729	Mr. Sawyer	356	’ screamed a voice from the two - pair landing . ‘
212748	212760	212763	212764	Mrs. Raddle	573	’ said Bob Sawyer , looking round him with great dismay . ‘
212766	212767	212763	212764	Mrs. Raddle	573	’ ‘
212778	212791	212770	212770	you	356	’ replied the voice , with great shrillness and rapidity of utterance . ‘

212869	212889	212861	212861	You	356	’ said the voice of Mr. Raddle , which appeared to proceed from beneath some distant bed - clothes . ‘
212894	212899	212892	212892	themselves	1988	’ said Mrs. Raddle . ‘
212908	212922	212903	212903	you	356	‘ em every one downstairs ? You would if you was a man . ’
212935	212941	212932	212933	my dear	10214	’ replied Mr. Raddle pacifically , ‘

212962	212971	212943	212943	they	5766	’ replied Mrs. Raddle , with supreme contempt . ‘

213088	213097	213029	213029	you	356	’ said the prim man , looking round . ‘

213144	213149	213139	213139	Jack	576	’ interposed Bob Sawyer ; ‘

213276	213285	213273	213274	Mr. Sawyer	356	’ screamed the shrill voice of Mrs. Raddle , ‘

213388	213400	213380	213381	Mrs. Raddle	573	‘ Old enough to be his grandfather , you willin ! You ’re

213848	213856	213841	213842	Mr. Perker	362	‘ Dear Pickwick . As well as possible ’
214110	214121	214082	214083	the barmaid	9812	‘ Now , young man , what do you want ? ’
214122	214131	214133	214142	the youth , in a loud voice of treble quality	5813	‘ Is there anybody here , named Sam ? ’
214144	214151	214153	214154	Sam Weller	356	‘ What ’s the t’other name ? ’
214159	214165	214153	214154	Sam Weller	356	‘ How should I know ? ’
214176	214178	214179	214181	a sharp boy	5815	‘ You ’re
214186	214191	214183	214183	you	1304	’ said Mr. Weller ; ‘
214222	214243	214218	214218	you	1304	’ to a hot - el , and asking arter Sam , vith as much politeness as a vild Indian ? ’

214263	214271	214272	214272	Him	586	’ inquired Sam , with deep disdain . ‘
214284	214289	214290	214290	He	586	’ rejoined the boy . ‘
214295	214311	214323	214324	Mr. Weller	356	’ to come to the George and Wultur this arternoon , and ask for Sam . ’
214312	214321	214323	214324	Mr. Weller	356	‘ It ’s my father , my dear , ’
214339	214362	214323	214324	Mr. Weller	356	‘ blessed if I think he hardly knows wot my other name is . Well , young brockiley sprout , wot then ? ’
214363	214367	214369	214370	the boy	1304	‘ Why then , ’
214372	214384	214369	214370	the boy	1304	‘ you was to come to him at six o’clock to our ‘
214387	214405	214369	214370	the boy	1304	‘ cos he wants to see you -- Blue Boar , Leaden’all Markit . Shall I say you ’re
214407	214409	214323	214324	Mr. Weller	356	’ ? ’
214410	214416	214323	214324	Mr. Weller	356	‘ You may wenture on that ‘
214422	214704	214420	214420	Sir	9716	’ replied Sam . And thus empowered , the young gentleman walked away , awakening all the echoes in George Yard as he did so , with several chaste and extremely correct imitations of a drover ’s whistle , delivered in a tone of peculiar richness and volume . Mr. Weller having obtained leave of absence from Mr. Pickwick , who , in his then state of excitement and worry , was by no means displeased at being left alone , set forth , long before the appointed hour , and having plenty of time at his disposal , sauntered down as far as the Mansion House , where he paused and contemplated , with a face of great calmness and philosophy , the numerous cads and drivers of short stages who assemble near that famous place of resort , to the great terror and confusion of the old - lady population of these realms . Having loitered here , for half an hour or so , Mr. Weller turned , and began wending his way towards Leadenhall Market , through a variety of by - streets and courts . As he was sauntering away his spare time , and stopped to look at almost every object that met his gaze , it is by no means surprising that Mr. Weller should have paused before a small stationer ’s and print- seller ’s window ; but without further explanation it does appear surprising that his eyes should have no sooner rested on certain pictures which were exposed for sale therein , than he gave a sudden start , smote his right leg with great vehemence , and exclaimed , with energy , ‘
214716	214728	214323	214324	Mr. Weller	356	’ forgot all about it , till it was too late ! ’
214869	214872	214823	214836	A decidedly indelicate young gentleman , in a pair of wings and nothing else	5829	‘ valentine , ’
214918	214922	214926	214926	I	0	‘ I should ha ’
214930	214934	214936	214936	Sam	356	’ forgot it ! ’
215064	215080	215082	215093	the young lady who superintended the domestic arrangements of the Blue Boar	5839	‘ He wo n’t be here this three - quarters of an hour or more , ’
215095	215102	215104	215104	Sam	356	‘ Wery good , my dear , ’
215106	215114	215104	215104	Sam	356	‘ Let me have nine - penn’oth o ’
215130	215457	215458	215458	Vell	497	’ The brandy - and - water luke , and the inkstand , having been carried into the little parlour , and the young lady having carefully flattened down the coals to prevent their blazing , and carried away the poker to preclude the possibility of the fire being stirred , without the full privity and concurrence of the Blue Boar being first had and obtained , Sam Weller sat himself down in a box near the stove , and pulled out the sheet of gilt - edged letter - paper , and the hard - nibbed pen . Then looking carefully at the pen to see that there were no hairs in it , and dusting down the table , so that there might be no crumbs of bread under the paper , Sam tucked up the cuffs of his coat , squared his elbows , and composed himself to write . To ladies and gentlemen who are not in the habit of devoting themselves practically to the science of penmanship , writing a letter is no very easy task ; it being always considered necessary in such cases for the writer to recline his head on his left arm , so as to place his eyes as nearly as possible on a level with the paper , and , while glancing sideways at the letters he is constructing , to form with his tongue imaginary characters to correspond . These motions , although unquestionably of the greatest assistance to original composition , retard in some degree the progress of the writer ; and Sam had unconsciously been a full hour and a half writing words in small text , smearing out wrong letters with his little finger , and putting in new ones which required going over very often to render them visible through the old blots , when he was roused by the opening of the door and the entrance of his parent . ‘
215462	215467	215468	215468	Vell	497	’ said the father . ‘
215474	215484	215468	215468	Vell	497	’ responded the son , laying down his pen . ‘

215547	215552	215554	215554	Sam	356	‘ No better yet ? ’
215556	215562	215564	215565	Mr. Weller	356	‘ All the symptoms aggerawated , ’

219144	219155	219142	219142	Sammy	356	’ said Mr. Weller , in the same low voice , ‘
219167	219180	219164	219165	a human	5913	’ , to rise and address the cheer . There ’s a young ‘
219205	219212	219200	219200	she	5914	’ wisibly before my wery eyes . ’
219327	219346	219347	219348	The ladies	10146	‘ Ladies and gentlemen , I move our excellent brother , Mr. Anthony Humm , into the chair . ’
219545	219563	219564	219564	Your	5927	‘ REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF THE BRICK LANE BRANCH OF THE UNITED GRAND JUNCTION EBENEZER TEMPERANCE ASSOCIATION ‘
219592	219673	219588	219590	converts to Temperance	5929	‘ H. Walker , tailor , wife , and two children . When in better circumstances , owns to having been in the constant habit of drinking ale and beer ; says he is not certain whether he did not twice a week , for twenty years , taste “ dog ’s nose , ” which your committee find upon inquiry , to be compounded of warm porter , moist sugar , gin , and nutmeg ( a groan , and ‘
219678	219777	219778	219779	Betsy Martin	366	’ from an elderly female ) . Is now out of work and penniless ; thinks it must be the porter ( cheers ) or the loss of the use of his right hand ; is not certain which , but thinks it very likely that , if he had drunk nothing but water all his life , his fellow - workman would never have stuck a rusty needle in him , and thereby occasioned his accident ( tremendous cheering ) . Has nothing but cold water to drink , and never feels thirsty ( great applause ) . ‘
219917	220030	220031	220032	Thomas Burton	596	‘ Henry Beller was for many years toast - master at various corporation dinners , during which time he drank a great deal of foreign wine ; may sometimes have carried a bottle or two home with him ; is not quite certain of that , but is sure if he did , that he drank the contents . Feels very low and melancholy , is very feverish , and has a constant thirst upon him ; thinks it must be the wine he used to drink ( cheers ) . Is out of employ now ; and never touches a drop of foreign wine by any chance ( tremendous plaudits ) . ‘
220191	220224	220178	220178	he	596	’ Anthony Humm now moved that the assembly do regale itself with a song . With a view to their rational and moral enjoyment , Brother Mordlin had adapted the beautiful words of ‘
220235	220337	220230	220233	a Jolly Young Waterman	5942	’ to the tune of the Old Hundredth , which he would request them to join him in singing ( great applause ) . He might take that opportunity of expressing his firm persuasion that the late Mr. Dibdin , seeing the errors of his former life , had written that song to show the advantages of abstinence . It was a temperance song ( whirlwinds of cheers ) . The neatness of the young man ’s attire , the dexterity of his feathering , the enviable state of mind which enabled him in the beautiful words of the poet , to ‘
220347	220396	220230	220233	a Jolly Young Waterman	5942	’ all combined to prove that he must have been a water - drinker ( cheers ) . Oh , what a state of virtuous jollity ! ( rapturous cheering ) . And what was the young man ’s reward ? Let all young men present mark this : ‘
220407	220470	220471	220471	He	5942	’ ( Loud cheers , in which the ladies joined . ) What a bright example ! The sisterhood , the maidens , flocking round the young waterman , and urging him along the stream of duty and of temperance . But , was it the maidens of humble life only , who soothed , consoled , and supported him ? No ! ‘
220482	220559	220471	220471	He	5942	’ ( Immense cheering . ) The soft sex to a man -- he begged pardon , to a female -- rallied round the young waterman , and turned with disgust from the drinker of spirits ( cheers ) . The Brick Lane Branch brothers were watermen ( cheers and laughter ) . That room was their boat ; that audience were the maidens ; and he ( Mr. Anthony Humm ) , however unworthily , was ‘
220562	220568	220571	220571	he	5942	’ ( unbounded applause ) . ‘
220580	220589	220590	220591	The womin	5946	’ inquired Mr. Weller , in a whisper . ‘
220593	220602	220603	220603	He	5942	’ said Sam , in the same tone . ‘
220612	220617	220610	220610	Sammy	356	’ replied Mr. Weller ; ‘
220646	220728	220729	220729	My	0	’ Any further observations from the indignant old gentleman were cut short by the announcement of the song , which Mr. Anthony Humm gave out two lines at a time , for the information of such of his hearers as were unacquainted with the legend . While it was being sung , the little man with the drab shorts disappeared ; he returned immediately on its conclusion , and whispered Mr. Anthony Humm , with a face of the deepest importance . ‘
220732	220766	220729	220729	My	0	’ said Mr. Humm , holding up his hand in a deprecatory manner , to bespeak the silence of such of the stout old ladies as were yet a line or two behind ; ‘
220786	220815	220780	220781	Brother Stiggins	599	’ Out came the pocket - handkerchiefs again , in greater force than ever ; for Mr. Stiggins was excessively popular among the female constituency of Brick Lane . ‘
220823	220837	220820	220820	I	0	’ said Mr. Humm , looking round him , with a fat smile . ‘
220849	220887	220888	220888	He	599	’ The little man in the drab shorts who answered to the name of Brother Tadger , bustled down the ladder with great speed , and was immediately afterwards heard tumbling up with the Reverend Mr. Stiggins . ‘
220893	220897	220899	220900	Mr. Weller	356	’ , Sammy , ’
220910	220918	220920	220920	Sam	356	‘ Do n’t say nothin’ to me , ’
220922	220943	220944	220944	his	599	‘ for I ca n’t bear it . He ’s close to the door . I hear him a - knockin ’
220953	221059	220944	220944	his	599	’ As Sam Weller spoke , the little door flew open , and Brother Tadger appeared , closely followed by the Reverend Mr. Stiggins , who no sooner entered , than there was a great clapping of hands , and stamping of feet , and flourishing of handkerchiefs ; to all of which manifestations of delight , Brother Stiggins returned no other acknowledgment than staring with a wild eye , and a fixed smile , at the extreme top of the wick of the candle on the table , swaying his body to and fro , meanwhile , in a very unsteady and uncertain manner . ‘
221067	221073	221074	221074	I	0	’ whispered Mr. Anthony Humm . ‘
221081	221101	221079	221079	Sir	9716	’ replied Mr. Stiggins , in a tone in which ferocity was blended with an extreme thickness of utterance ; ‘
221109	221110	221107	221107	Sir	9716	’ ‘
221116	221127	221107	221107	Sir	9716	’ rejoined Mr. Anthony Humm , retreating a few paces . ‘
221146	221151	221144	221144	Sir	9716	’ said Mr. Stiggins . ‘
221157	221162	221144	221144	Sir	9716	’ said Mr. Humm . ‘
221178	221203	221172	221172	I	0	’ said Mr. Stiggins . By this time the audience were perfectly silent , and waited with some anxiety for the resumption of business . ‘
221212	221223	221205	221205	you	9716	’ said Mr. Humm , with a smile of invitation . ‘
221228	221233	221226	221226	sir	9716	’ rejoined Mr. Stiggins ; ‘
221244	221265	221242	221242	sir	9716	’ The meeting looked at each other with raised eyelids ; and a murmur of astonishment ran through the room . ‘
221273	221305	221307	221308	Mr. Stiggins	539	’ said Mr. Stiggins , unbuttoning his coat , and speaking very loudly--‘it ’s my opinion , sir , that this meeting is drunk , sir . Brother Tadger , sir ! ’
221328	221337	221307	221308	Mr. Stiggins	539	‘ _ you _ are drunk , sir ! ’
221500	221505	221507	221508	Mr. Weller	356	‘ Now , Sammy , ’
221518	221530	221507	221508	Mr. Weller	356	‘ just you step out , and fetch in a watchman . ’
221531	221545	221547	221547	Sam	356	‘ And wot are you a - goin’ to do , the while ? ’
221549	221557	221559	221561	the old gentleman	10238	‘ Never you mind me , Sammy , ’
221563	221575	221559	221561	the old gentleman	10238	‘ I shall ockipy myself in havin’ a small settlement with that ‘
221579	221611	221577	221577	Stiggins	539	’ Before Sam could interfere to prevent it , his heroic parent had penetrated into a remote corner of the room , and attacked the Reverend Mr. Stiggins with manual dexterity . ‘
221615	221619	221577	221577	Stiggins	539	’ said Sam . ‘
221623	221833	221835	221836	Mr. Snodgrass	242	’ cried Mr. Weller ; and without further invitation he gave the Reverend Mr. Stiggins a preliminary tap on the head , and began dancing round him in a buoyant and cork - like manner , which in a gentleman at his time of life was a perfect marvel to behold . Finding all remonstrances unavailing , Sam pulled his hat firmly on , threw his father ’s coat over his arm , and taking the old man round the waist , forcibly dragged him down the ladder , and into the street ; never releasing his hold , or permitting him to stop , until they reached the corner . As they gained it , they could hear the shouts of the populace , who were witnessing the removal of the Reverend Mr. Stiggins to strong lodgings for the night , and could hear the noise occasioned by the dispersion in various directions of the members of the Brick Lane Branch of the United Grand Junction Ebenezer Temperance Association . CHAPTER XXXIV . IS WHOLLY DEVOTED TO A FULL AND FAITHFUL REPORT OF THE MEMORABLE TRIAL OF BARDELL AGAINST PICKWICK I wonder what the foreman of the jury , whoever he ’ll be , has got for breakfast , ’
221855	221858	221860	221860	Perker	362	‘ Ah ! ’
221862	221872	221860	221860	Perker	362	‘ I hope he ’s got a good one . ’
221876	221881	221860	221860	Perker	362	’ inquired Mr. Pickwick . ‘
221892	221896	221890	221890	Sir	9716	’ replied Perker . ‘
221930	221931	221915	221918	Discontented or hungry jurymen	5973	’ ‘
221936	221945	221915	221918	Discontented or hungry jurymen	5973	’ said Mr. Pickwick , looking very blank , ‘
221953	221954	221948	221948	they	5976	’ ‘
221962	221969	221973	221973	I	0	’ replied the little man coolly ; ‘
222153	222164	222140	222140	they	5991	’ said the little man , looking at his watch . ‘
222206	222252	222253	222253	Lowten	473	’ Mr. Pickwick immediately rang the bell , and a coach having been procured , the four Pickwickians and Mr. Perker ensconced themselves therein , and drove to Guildhall ; Sam Weller , Mr. Lowten , and the blue bag , following in a cab . ‘
222255	222269	222253	222253	Lowten	473	’ said Perker , when they reached the outer hall of the court , ‘
222278	222300	222253	222253	Lowten	473	’ box ; Mr. Pickwick himself had better sit by me . This way , my dear sir , this way . ’
222422	222433	222435	222436	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ That ’s the witness - box , I suppose ? ’
222455	222467	222469	222469	Perker	362	‘ That ’s the witness - box , my dear sir , ’
222490	222494	222496	222497	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ And that , ’
222510	222522	222496	222497	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ that ’s where the jurymen sit , is it not ? ’
222523	222532	222534	222534	Perker	362	‘ The identical place , my dear Sir , ’
222589	222702	222927	222939	that red - faced man , who said it was a fine morning	6013	’ seats , who presented , as a body , all that pleasing and extensive variety of nose and whisker for which the Bar of England is so justly celebrated . Such of the gentlemen as had a brief to carry , carried it in as conspicuous a manner as possible , and occasionally scratched their noses therewith , to impress the fact more strongly on the observation of the spectators . Other gentlemen , who had no briefs to show , carried under their arms goodly octavos , with a red label behind , and that under - done - pie - crust - coloured cover , which is technically known as ‘
222706	222924	222978	222978	him	601	’ Others , who had neither briefs nor books , thrust their hands into their pockets , and looked as wise as they conveniently could ; others , again , moved here and there with great restlessness and earnestness of manner , content to awaken thereby the admiration and astonishment of the uninitiated strangers . The whole , to the great wonderment of Mr. Pickwick , were divided into little groups , who were chatting and discussing the news of the day in the most unfeeling manner possible -- just as if no trial at all were coming on . A bow from Mr. Phunky , as he entered , and took his seat behind the row appropriated to the King ’s Counsel , attracted Mr. Pickwick ’s attention ; and he had scarcely returned it , when Mr. Serjeant Snubbin appeared , followed by Mr. Mallard , who half hid the Serjeant behind a large crimson bag , which he placed on his table , and , after shaking hands with Perker , withdrew . Then there entered two or three more Serjeants ; and among them , one with a fat body and a red face , who nodded in a friendly manner to Mr. Serjeant Snubbin , and said it was a fine morning . ‘
222947	222952	222927	222939	that red - faced man , who said it was a fine morning	6013	’ whispered Mr. Pickwick . ‘
222957	222961	222953	222955	Mr. Serjeant Buzfuz	601	’ replied Perker . ‘
222986	223060	222980	222981	Mr. Skimpin	602	’ Mr. Pickwick was on the point of inquiring , with great abhorrence of the man ’s cold - blooded villainy , how Mr. Serjeant Buzfuz , who was counsel for the opposite party , dared to presume to tell Mr. Serjeant Snubbin , who was counsel for him , that it was a fine morning , when he was interrupted by a general rising of the barristers , and a loud cry of ‘
223063	223226	222980	222981	Mr. Skimpin	602	’ from the officers of the court . Looking round , he found that this was caused by the entrance of the judge . Mr. Justice Stareleigh ( who sat in the absence of the Chief Justice , occasioned by indisposition ) was a most particularly short man , and so fat , that he seemed all face and waistcoat . He rolled in , upon two little turned legs , and having bobbed gravely to the Bar , who bobbed gravely to him , put his little legs underneath his table , and his little three - cornered hat upon it ; and when Mr. Justice Stareleigh had done this , all you could see of him was two queer little eyes , one broad pink face , and somewhere about half of a big and very comical - looking wig . The judge had no sooner taken his seat , than the officer on the floor of the court called out ‘
223229	223243	222980	222981	Mr. Skimpin	602	’ in a commanding tone , upon which another officer in the gallery cried ‘
223246	223259	222980	222981	Mr. Skimpin	602	’ in an angry manner , whereupon three or four more ushers shouted ‘
223262	223355	222980	222981	Mr. Skimpin	602	’ in a voice of indignant remonstrance . This being done , a gentleman in black , who sat below the judge , proceeded to call over the names of the jury ; and after a great deal of bawling , it was discovered that only ten special jurymen were present . Upon this , Mr. Serjeant Buzfuz prayed a _ tales _ ; the gentleman in black then proceeded to press into the special jury , two of the common jurymen ; and a greengrocer and a chemist were caught directly . ‘
223369	223376	223361	223361	gentlemen	10163	’ said the gentleman in black . ‘
223380	223381	223377	223378	Richard Upwitch	604	’ ‘
223384	223389	223390	223391	Thomas Groffin	605	’ said the greengrocer . ‘
223393	223394	223390	223391	Thomas Groffin	605	’ ‘
223397	223402	223390	223391	Thomas Groffin	605	’ said the chemist . ‘
223415	223416	223417	223417	I	0	’ ‘
223424	223441	223417	223417	I	0	’ said the chemist , who was a tall , thin , yellow - visaged man , ‘
223452	223453	223443	223443	I	0	’ ‘
223460	223466	223458	223458	Sir	9716	’ said Mr. Justice Stareleigh . ‘
223475	223480	223472	223473	my Lord	12992	’ said the chemist . ‘
223489	223495	223487	223487	Sir	9716	’ replied Mr. Justice Stareleigh . ‘
223501	223502	223503	223503	I	0	’ ‘
223512	223517	223503	223503	I	0	’ rejoined the chemist . ‘
223530	223553	223528	223528	Sir	9716	’ said the judge , reddening ; for Mr. Justice Stareleigh ’s temper bordered on the irritable , and brooked not contradiction . ‘
223581	223586	223574	223574	I	0	’ answered the chemist . ‘
223591	223605	223588	223589	the gentleman	883	’ said the judge peremptorily . The officer had got no further than the ‘
223613	223623	223606	223606	You	9716	’ when he was again interrupted by the chemist . ‘
223636	223641	223630	223631	my Lord	12992	’ said the chemist . ‘
223646	223653	223644	223644	sir	9716	’ replied the testy little judge . ‘
223660	223670	223644	223644	sir	9716	’ replied the chemist , in a resigned manner . ‘
223695	223711	223693	223693	Sir	9716	’ and sworn the chemist was , before the judge could find words to utter . ‘
223721	223733	223718	223719	my Lord	12992	’ said the chemist , taking his seat with great deliberation , ‘
223799	224052	223796	223797	my Lord	12992	’ With this , the tall chemist composed himself into a comfortable attitude , and , assuming a pleasant expression of countenance , appeared to have prepared himself for the worst . Mr. Pickwick was regarding the chemist with feelings of the deepest horror , when a slight sensation was perceptible in the body of the court ; and immediately afterwards Mrs. Bardell , supported by Mrs. Cluppins , was led in , and placed , in a drooping state , at the other end of the seat on which Mr. Pickwick sat . An extra - sized umbrella was then handed in by Mr. Dodson , and a pair of pattens by Mr. Fogg , each of whom had prepared a most sympathising and melancholy face for the occasion . Mrs. Sanders then appeared , leading in Master Bardell . At sight of her child , Mrs. Bardell started ; suddenly recollecting herself , she kissed him in a frantic manner ; then relapsing into a state of hysterical imbecility , the good lady requested to be informed where she was . In reply to this , Mrs. Cluppins and Mrs. Sanders turned their heads away and wept , while Messrs. Dodson and Fogg entreated the plaintiff to compose herself . Serjeant Buzfuz rubbed his eyes very hard with a large white handkerchief , and gave an appealing look towards the jury , while the judge was visibly affected , and several of the beholders tried to cough down their emotion . ‘
224059	224066	224067	224072	Capital fellows those Dodson and Fogg	6042	’ whispered Perker to Mr. Pickwick . ‘
224085	224234	224235	224235	Bardell	370	’ As Perker spoke , Mrs. Bardell began to recover by slow degrees , while Mrs. Cluppins , after a careful survey of Master Bardell ’s buttons and the button - holes to which they severally belonged , placed him on the floor of the court in front of his mother -- a commanding position in which he could not fail to awaken the full commiseration and sympathy of both judge and jury . This was not done without considerable opposition , and many tears , on the part of the young gentleman himself , who had certain inward misgivings that the placing him within the full glare of the judge ’s eye was only a formal prelude to his being immediately ordered away for instant execution , or for transportation beyond the seas , during the whole term of his natural life , at the very least . ‘
224239	224258	224235	224235	Bardell	370	’ cried the gentleman in black , calling on the case , which stood first on the list . ‘
224268	224274	224262	224263	the plaintiff	12298	’ said Mr. Serjeant Buzfuz . ‘
224283	224298	224299	224299	I	0	’ said the judge . Mr. Skimpin bowed , to intimate that he was . ‘
224308	224314	224305	224306	my Lord	12992	’ said Mr. Serjeant Snubbin . ‘
224322	224327	224328	224329	Mr. Phunky	569	’ inquired the court . ‘
224334	224339	224328	224329	Mr. Phunky	569	’ replied Serjeant Snubbin . ‘
224349	224370	224343	224344	Mr. Skimpin	602	’ said the judge , writing down the names in his note - book , and reading as he wrote ; ‘
224381	224382	224389	224389	Phunky	569	’ ‘
224391	224392	224389	224389	Phunky	569	’ ‘
224398	224403	224389	224389	Phunky	569	’ said the judge ; ‘
224417	224483	224389	224389	Phunky	569	’ Here Mr. Phunky bowed and smiled , and the judge bowed and smiled too , and then Mr. Phunky , blushing into the very whites of his eyes , tried to look as if he did n’t know that everybody was gazing at him , a thing which no man ever succeeded in doing yet , or in all reasonable probability , ever will . ‘
224487	224503	224389	224389	Phunky	569	’ said the judge . The ushers again called silence , and Mr. Skimpin proceeded to ‘
224507	224806	224389	224389	Phunky	569	’ ; and the case appeared to have very little inside it when he had opened it , for he kept such particulars as he knew , completely to himself , and sat down , after a lapse of three minutes , leaving the jury in precisely the same advanced stage of wisdom as they were in before . Serjeant Buzfuz then rose with all the majesty and dignity which the grave nature of the proceedings demanded , and having whispered to Dodson , and conferred briefly with Fogg , pulled his gown over his shoulders , settled his wig , and addressed the jury . Serjeant Buzfuz began by saying , that never , in the whole course of his professional experience -- never , from the very first moment of his applying himself to the study and practice of the law -- had he approached a case with feelings of such deep emotion , or with such a heavy sense of the responsibility imposed upon him -- a responsibility , he would say , which he could never have supported , were he not buoyed up and sustained by a conviction so strong , that it amounted to positive certainty that the cause of truth and justice , or , in other words , the cause of his much - injured and most oppressed client , must prevail with the high- minded and intelligent dozen of men whom he now saw in that box before him . Counsel usually begin in this way , because it puts the jury on the very best terms with themselves , and makes them think what sharp fellows they must be . A visible effect was produced immediately , several jurymen beginning to take voluminous notes with the utmost eagerness . ‘
224817	224942	224807	224807	You	6053	’ continued Serjeant Buzfuz , well knowing that , from the learned friend alluded to , the gentlemen of the jury had heard just nothing at all--‘you have heard from my learned friend , gentlemen , that this is an action for a breach of promise of marriage , in which the damages are laid at £ 1,500 . But you have not heard from my learned friend , inasmuch as it did not come within my learned friend ’s province to tell you , what are the facts and circumstances of the case . Those facts and circumstances , gentlemen , you shall hear detailed by me , and proved by the unimpeachable female whom I will place in that box before you . ’
224956	224959	224961	224961	his	601	‘ box , ’
224989	224995	224997	224998	Serjeant Buzfuz	601	‘ The plaintiff , gentlemen , ’
225007	225075	224997	224998	Serjeant Buzfuz	601	‘ the plaintiff is a widow ; yes , gentlemen , a widow . The late Mr. Bardell , after enjoying , for many years , the esteem and confidence of his sovereign , as one of the guardians of his royal revenues , glided almost imperceptibly from the world , to seek elsewhere for that repose and peace which a custom - house can never afford . ’
225119	225192	225114	225114	he	6059	‘ Some time before his death , he had stamped his likeness upon a little boy . With this little boy , the only pledge of her departed exciseman , Mrs. Bardell shrank from the world , and courted the retirement and tranquillity of Goswell Street ; and here she placed in her front parlour window a written placard , bearing this inscription--“Apartments furnished for a single gentleman . Inquire within . ” ’
225211	225222	225224	225225	a juror	6061	‘ There is no date to that , is there ? ’
225227	225235	225237	225238	Serjeant Buzfuz	601	‘ There is no date , gentlemen , ’
225240	225597	225237	225238	Serjeant Buzfuz	601	‘ but I am instructed to say that it was put in the plaintiff ’s parlour window just this time three years . I entreat the attention of the jury to the wording of this document--“Apartments furnished for a single gentleman ” ! Mrs. Bardell ’s opinions of the opposite sex , gentlemen , were derived from a long contemplation of the inestimable qualities of her lost husband . She had no fear , she had no distrust , she had no suspicion ; all was confidence and reliance . “ Mr. Bardell , ” said the widow--“Mr . Bardell was a man of honour , Mr. Bardell was a man of his word , Mr. Bardell was no deceiver , Mr. Bardell was once a single gentleman himself ; to single gentlemen I look for protection , for assistance , for comfort , and for consolation ; in single gentlemen I shall perpetually see something to remind me of what Mr. Bardell was when he first won my young and untried affections ; to a single gentleman , then , shall my lodgings be let . ” Actuated by this beautiful and touching impulse ( among the best impulses of our imperfect nature , gentlemen ) , the lonely and desolate widow dried her tears , furnished her first floor , caught her innocent boy to her maternal bosom , and put the bill up in her parlour window . Did it remain there long ? No . The serpent was on the watch , the train was laid , the mine was preparing , the sapper and miner was at work . Before the bill had been in the parlour window three days -- three days , gentlemen -- a being , erect upon two legs , and bearing all the outward semblance of a man , and not of a monster , knocked at the door of Mrs. Bardell ’s house . He inquired within -- he took the lodgings ; and on the very next day he entered into possession of them . This man was Pickwick -- Pickwick , the defendant . ’
225666	225716	225663	225664	Serjeant Buzfuz	601	‘ Of this man Pickwick I will say little ; the subject presents but few attractions ; and I , gentlemen , am not the man , nor are you , gentlemen , the men , to delight in the contemplation of revolting heartlessness , and of systematic villainy . ’
225798	225806	225808	225809	Serjeant Buzfuz	601	‘ I say systematic villainy , gentlemen , ’
225823	226021	225808	225809	Serjeant Buzfuz	601	‘ and when I say systematic villainy , let me tell the defendant Pickwick , if he be in court , as I am informed he is , that it would have been more decent in him , more becoming , in better judgment , and in better taste , if he had stopped away . Let me tell him , gentlemen , that any gestures of dissent or disapprobation in which he may indulge in this court will not go down with you ; that you will know how to value and how to appreciate them ; and let me tell him further , as my Lord will tell you , gentlemen , that a counsel , in the discharge of his duty to his client , is neither to be intimidated nor bullied , nor put down ; and that any attempt to do either the one or the other , or the first , or the last , will recoil on the head of the attempter , be he plaintiff or be he defendant , be his name Pickwick , or Noakes , or Stoakes , or Stiles , or Brown , or Thompson . ’
226067	226479	226507	226507	he	6059	‘ I shall show you , gentlemen , that for two years , Pickwick continued to reside constantly , and without interruption or intermission , at Mrs. Bardell ’s house . I shall show you that Mrs. Bardell , during the whole of that time , waited on him , attended to his comforts , cooked his meals , looked out his linen for the washerwoman when it went abroad , darned , aired , and prepared it for wear , when it came home , and , in short , enjoyed his fullest trust and confidence . I shall show you that , on many occasions , he gave halfpence , and on some occasions even sixpences , to her little boy ; and I shall prove to you , by a witness whose testimony it will be impossible for my learned friend to weaken or controvert , that on one occasion he patted the boy on the head , and , after inquiring whether he had won any “ _ alley tors _ ” or “ _ commoneys _ ” lately ( both of which I understand to be a particular species of marbles much prized by the youth of this town ) , made use of this remarkable expression , “ How should you like to have another father ? ” I shall prove to you , gentlemen , that about a year ago , Pickwick suddenly began to absent himself from home , during long intervals , as if with the intention of gradually breaking off from my client ; but I shall show you also , that his resolution was not at that time sufficiently strong , or that his better feelings conquered , if better feelings he has , or that the charms and accomplishments of my client prevailed against his unmanly intentions , by proving to you , that on one occasion , when he returned from the country , he distinctly and in terms , offered her marriage : previously , however , taking special care that there would be no witness to their solemn contract ; and I am in a situation to prove to you , on the testimony of three of his own friends -- most unwilling witnesses , gentlemen -- most unwilling witnesses -- that on that morning he was discovered by them holding the plaintiff in his arms , and soothing her agitation by his caresses and endearments . ’
226509	226987	226507	226507	he	6059	‘ And now , gentlemen , but one word more . Two letters have passed between these parties , letters which are admitted to be in the handwriting of the defendant , and which speak volumes , indeed . The letters , too , bespeak the character of the man . They are not open , fervent , eloquent epistles , breathing nothing but the language of affectionate attachment . They are covert , sly , underhanded communications , but , fortunately , far more conclusive than if couched in the most glowing language and the most poetic imagery -- letters that must be viewed with a cautious and suspicious eye -- letters that were evidently intended at the time , by Pickwick , to mislead and delude any third parties into whose hands they might fall . Let me read the first : “ Garraways , twelve o’clock . Dear Mrs. B.--Chops and tomato sauce . Yours , _ Pickwick _ . ” Gentlemen , what does this mean ? Chops and tomato sauce . Yours , Pickwick ! Chops ! Gracious heavens ! and tomato sauce ! Gentlemen , is the happiness of a sensitive and confiding female to be trifled away , by such shallow artifices as these ? The next has no date whatever , which is in itself suspicious . “ Dear Mrs. B. , I shall not be at home till to - morrow . Slow coach . ” And then follows this very remarkable expression . “ Do n’t trouble yourself about the warming - pan . ” The warming - pan ! Why , gentlemen , who _ does _ trouble himself about a warming - pan ? When was the peace of mind of man or woman broken or disturbed by a warming - pan , which is in itself a harmless , a useful , and I will add , gentlemen , a comforting article of domestic furniture ? Why is Mrs. Bardell so earnestly entreated not to agitate herself about this warming - pan , unless ( as is no doubt the case ) it is a mere cover for hidden fire -- a mere substitute for some endearing word or promise , agreeably to a preconcerted system of correspondence , artfully contrived by Pickwick with a view to his contemplated desertion , and which I am not in a condition to explain ? And what does this allusion to the slow coach mean ? For aught I know , it may be a reference to Pickwick himself , who has most unquestionably been a criminally slow coach during the whole of this transaction , but whose speed will now be very unexpectedly accelerated , and whose wheels , gentlemen , as he will find to his cost , will very soon be greased by you ! ’
227060	227068	227070	227072	Mr. Serjeant Buzfuz	601	‘ But enough of this , gentlemen , ’
227074	227361	227070	227072	Mr. Serjeant Buzfuz	601	‘ it is difficult to smile with an aching heart ; it is ill jesting when our deepest sympathies are awakened . My client ’s hopes and prospects are ruined , and it is no figure of speech to say that her occupation is gone indeed . The bill is down -- but there is no tenant . Eligible single gentlemen pass and repass -- but there is no invitation for to inquire within or without . All is gloom and silence in the house ; even the voice of the child is hushed ; his infant sports are disregarded when his mother weeps ; his “ alley tors ” and his “ commoneys ” are alike neglected ; he forgets the long familiar cry of “ knuckle down , ” and at tip - cheese , or odd and even , his hand is out . But Pickwick , gentlemen , Pickwick , the ruthless destroyer of this domestic oasis in the desert of Goswell Street -- Pickwick who has choked up the well , and thrown ashes on the sward -- Pickwick , who comes before you to - day with his heartless tomato sauce and warming - pans -- Pickwick still rears his head with unblushing effrontery , and gazes without a sigh on the ruin he has made . Damages , gentlemen -- heavy damages is the only punishment with which you can visit him ; the only recompense you can award to my client . And for those damages she now appeals to an enlightened , a high - minded , a right- feeling , a conscientious , a dispassionate , a sympathising , a contemplative jury of her civilised countrymen . ’
227380	227385	227387	227388	Serjeant Buzfuz	601	‘ Call Elizabeth Cluppins , ’
227580	227584	227586	227587	Serjeant Buzfuz	601	‘ Mrs. Cluppins , ’

227701	227706	227696	227696	jury	14788	’ replied Mrs. Cluppins . ‘

227732	227737	227720	227720	I	0	’ replied Mrs. Cluppins . ‘
227749	227755	227759	227759	jury	14788	’ inquired the little judge . ‘
227761	227770	227759	227759	jury	14788	’ said Mrs. Cluppins , with interesting agitation , ‘
227777	227778	227771	227771	I	0	’ ‘
227786	227792	227779	227779	You	532	’ said the little judge . ‘
227797	227802	227793	227793	I	0	’ resumed Mrs. Cluppins , ‘
227847	227848	227838	227839	Mrs. Bardell	369	’ ‘
227853	227859	227838	227839	Mrs. Bardell	369	’ exclaimed the little judge . ‘
227866	227871	227872	227872	She	369	’ said Serjeant Snubbin . ‘
227878	227889	227872	227872	She	369	’ said the little judge , with a cunning look . ‘
227899	227924	227896	227897	my Lord	12992	’ said Serjeant Snubbin . The little judge looked doubtful , and said he ’d make a note of it . Mrs. Cluppins then resumed-- ‘
227937	227969	227896	227897	my Lord	12992	’ , and went , in a permiscuous manner , upstairs , and into the back room . Gentlemen , there was the sound of voices in the front room , and-- ’
227970	227981	227983	227984	Serjeant Buzfuz	601	‘ And you listened , I believe , Mrs. Cluppins ? ’
227986	227988	227989	227989	your	10163	‘ Beggin ’
227994	228004	227992	227992	Sir	9716	’ replied Mrs. Cluppins , in a majestic manner , ‘
228026	228027	228017	228017	Sir	448	’ ‘
228052	228053	228049	228049	Pickwick	240	’ ‘
228061	228272	228059	228059	Sir	9716	’ And Mrs. Cluppins , after distinctly stating that Mr. Pickwick addressed himself to Mrs. Bardell , repeated by slow degrees , and by dint of many questions , the conversation with which our readers are already acquainted . The jury looked suspicious , and Mr. Serjeant Buzfuz smiled as he sat down . They looked positively awful when Serjeant Snubbin intimated that he should not cross - examine the witness , for Mr. Pickwick wished it to be distinctly stated that it was due to her to say , that her account was in substance correct . Mrs. Cluppins having once broken the ice , thought it a favourable opportunity for entering into a short dissertation on her own domestic affairs ; so she straightway proceeded to inform the court that she was the mother of eight children at that present speaking , and that she entertained confident expectations of presenting Mr. Cluppins with a ninth , somewhere about that day six months . At this interesting point , the little judge interposed most irascibly ; and the effect of the interposition was , that both the worthy lady and Mrs. Sanders were politely taken out of court , under the escort of Mr. Jackson , without further parley . ‘
228276	228281	228059	228059	Sir	9716	’ said Mr. Skimpin . ‘
228284	228312	228059	228059	Sir	9716	’ replied a feeble voice . Mr. Winkle entered the witness - box , and having been duly sworn , bowed to the judge with considerable deference . ‘
228321	228333	228319	228319	Sir	9716	’ said the judge sharply , in acknowledgment of the salute ; ‘
228339	228429	228336	228337	the jury	14329	’ Mr. Winkle obeyed the mandate , and looked at the place where he thought it most probable the jury might be ; for seeing anything in his then state of intellectual complication was wholly out of the question . Mr. Winkle was then examined by Mr. Skimpin , who , being a promising young man of two or three - and - forty , was of course anxious to confuse a witness who was notoriously predisposed in favour of the other side , as much as he could . ‘
228434	228439	228336	228337	the jury	14329	’ said Mr. Skimpin , ‘
228456	228511	228512	228512	Winkle	276	’ and Mr. Skimpin inclined his head on one side to listen with great sharpness to the answer , and glanced at the jury meanwhile , as if to imply that he rather expected Mr. Winkle ’s natural taste for perjury would induce him to give some name which did not belong to him . ‘
228514	228519	228512	228512	Winkle	276	’ replied the witness . ‘
228528	228535	228536	228536	Nathaniel	276	’ angrily inquired the little judge . ‘
228540	228541	228538	228538	Sir	9716	’ ‘
228548	228549	228550	228550	Nathaniel	276	’ ‘
228560	228561	228550	228550	Nathaniel	276	’ ‘
228569	228570	228566	228567	Daniel Nathaniel	619	’ ‘
228584	228585	228577	228577	Nathaniel	619	’ ‘
228600	228605	228588	228588	you	9716	’ inquired the judge . ‘
228613	228618	228619	228619	You	9716	’ replied Mr. Winkle . ‘
228624	228634	228622	228622	Sir	9716	’ replied the judge , with a severe frown . ‘
228653	228663	228651	228651	Sir	9716	’ This argument was , of course , unanswerable . ‘
228675	228687	228664	228665	Mr. Winkle	276	’ interposed Mr. Skimpin , with another glance at the jury . ‘
228707	228708	228703	228703	I	0	’ ‘
228717	228764	228715	228715	Sir	9716	’ said the little judge , with a sinister look at the witness . Poor Mr. Winkle bowed , and endeavoured to feign an easiness of manner , which , in his then state of confusion , gave him rather the air of a disconcerted pickpocket . ‘
228770	228775	228767	228768	Mr. Winkle	276	’ said Mr. Skimpin , ‘
228827	228828	228829	228829	I	0	’ ‘

228901	228917	228919	228921	the little judge	14942	’ If you do n’t answer the question , you ’ll be committed , Sir , ’
228930	228935	228937	228938	Mr. Skimpin	602	‘ Come , Sir , ’
228940	228949	228937	228938	Mr. Skimpin	602	‘ yes or no , if you please . ’
228950	228956	228958	228959	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ Yes , I am , ’
228961	228991	228958	228959	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ Yes , you are . And why could n’t you say that at once , Sir ? Perhaps you know the plaintiff too ? Eh , Mr. Winkle ? ’
228992	229004	228919	228921	the little judge	14942	‘ I do n’t know her ; I ’ve seen her . ’
229005	229041	228937	228938	Mr. Skimpin	602	‘ Oh , you do n’t know her , but you ’ve seen her ? Now , have the goodness to tell the gentlemen of the jury what you mean by that , Mr. Winkle . ’
229042	229071	228958	228959	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ I mean that I am not intimate with her , but I have seen her when I went to call on Mr. Pickwick , in Goswell Street . ’
229072	229082	228919	228921	the little judge	14942	‘ How often have you seen her , Sir ? ’
229083	229087	228937	228938	Mr. Skimpin	602	‘ How often ? ’
229088	229115	229117	229119	the learned gentleman	6063	‘ Yes , Mr. Winkle , how often ? I ’ll repeat the question for you a dozen times , if you require it , Sir . ’
229199	229206	229196	229196	he	276	‘ Certainly -- more than that . ’
229306	229344	229392	229392	they	6116	‘ Pray , Mr. Winkle , do you remember calling on the defendant Pickwick at these apartments in the plaintiff ’s house in Goswell Street , on one particular morning , in the month of July last ? ’
229345	229351	229392	229392	they	6116	‘ Yes , I do . ’
229352	229376	229392	229392	they	6116	‘ Were you accompanied on that occasion by a friend of the name of Tupman , and another by the name of Snodgrass ? ’
229377	229383	229392	229392	they	6116	‘ Yes , I was . ’
229384	229389	229392	229392	they	6116	‘ Are they here ? ’
229395	229412	229392	229392	they	6116	’ replied Mr. Winkle , looking very earnestly towards the spot where his friends were stationed . ‘
229427	229440	229441	229441	They	1988	’ said Mr. Skimpin , with another expressive look at the jury . ‘
229509	229510	229511	229512	The defendant	3897	’ ‘
229532	229540	229511	229512	The defendant	3897	’ replied Mr. Winkle with natural hesitation , ‘

229683	229695	229697	229698	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ I -- I did n’t understand him so , certainly , ’
229715	229734	229697	229698	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ I was on the staircase , and could n’t hear distinctly ; the impression on my mind is-- ’
229735	229767	229769	229770	Mr. Skimpin	602	‘ The gentlemen of the jury want none of the impressions on your mind , Mr. Winkle , which I fear would be of little service to honest , straightforward men , ’
229772	229808	229769	229770	Mr. Skimpin	602	‘ You were on the staircase , and did n’t distinctly hear ; but you will not swear that Pickwick did not make use of the expressions I have quoted ? Do I understand that ? ’
229809	229816	229818	229819	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ No , I will not , ’
229916	229923	229925	229926	Mr. Phunky	569	‘ I believe , Mr. Winkle , ’
229928	229938	229925	229926	Mr. Phunky	569	‘ that Mr. Pickwick is not a young man ? ’
229939	229944	229946	229947	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ Oh , no , ’
229949	229957	229946	229947	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ old enough to be my father . ’
229958	229992	229925	229926	Mr. Phunky	569	‘ You have told my learned friend that you have known Mr. Pickwick a long time . Had you ever any reason to suppose or believe that he was about to be married ? ’
229993	230001	230003	230004	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ Oh , no ; certainly not ; ’
230062	230074	230076	230077	Mr. Phunky	569	‘ I will even go further than this , Mr. Winkle , ’
230087	230123	230076	230077	Mr. Phunky	569	‘ Did you ever see anything in Mr. Pickwick ’s manner and conduct towards the opposite sex , to induce you to believe that he ever contemplated matrimony of late years , in any case ? ’
230124	230132	230134	230135	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ Oh , no ; certainly not , ’
230137	230186	230134	230135	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ Has his behaviour , when females have been in the case , always been that of a man , who , having attained a pretty advanced period of life , content with his own occupations and amusements , treats them only as a father might his daughters ? ’
230187	230195	230197	230198	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ Not the least doubt of it , ’
230207	230219	230204	230204	his	276	‘ That is -- yes -- oh , yes -- certainly . ’
230220	230244	230246	230247	Mr. Phunky	569	‘ You have never known anything in his behaviour towards Mrs. Bardell , or any other female , in the least degree suspicious ? ’
230262	230269	230271	230272	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ N - n - no , ’
230274	230293	230271	230272	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ except on one trifling occasion , which , I have no doubt , might be easily explained . ’
230413	230421	230423	230424	Serjeant Buzfuz	601	‘ Stay , Mr. Winkle , stay ! ’
230426	230464	230423	230424	Serjeant Buzfuz	601	‘ will your Lordship have the goodness to ask him , what this one instance of suspicious behaviour towards females on the part of this gentleman , who is old enough to be his father , was ? ’
230465	230476	230478	230479	the judge	14328	‘ You hear what the learned counsel says , Sir , ’
230490	230499	230478	230479	the judge	14328	‘ Describe the occasion to which you refer . ’
230500	230504	230506	230507	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ My Lord , ’
230513	230520	230506	230507	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ I -- I’d rather not . ’
230521	230525	230527	230529	the little judge	14942	‘ Perhaps so , ’
230531	230536	230527	230529	the little judge	14942	‘ but you must . ’

The little judge turned to the witness as soon as his indignation would allow him to speak , and said-- ‘

231824	231828	231814	231815	Mr. Pickwick	240	’ replied Sam ; ‘

232314	232326	232312	232312	sir	9716	’ replied Sam ; and at this the spectators tittered again . ‘
232348	232359	232345	232346	Mr. Weller	356	’ said Serjeant Buzfuz , looking knowingly at the jury . ‘
232375	232380	232382	232382	Sam	356	’ about the trial , ’
232384	232397	232399	232400	Serjeant Buzfuz	601	‘ Oh , you did get a - talking about the trial , ’

232445	232449	232443	232443	sir	9716	’ replied Sam . ‘

232531	232537	232443	232443	sir	9716	’ said Mr. Serjeant Buzfuz . ‘

232613	232653	232573	232573	they	6217	’ At this very unexpected reply , the spectators tittered again , and Dodson & amp ; Fogg , turning very red , leaned over to Serjeant Buzfuz , and in a hurried manner whispered something in his ear . ‘
232659	232669	232654	232654	You	6221	’ said Serjeant Buzfuz aloud , with affected composure . ‘

232821	232832	232834	232835	Serjeant Snubbin	566	‘ I have no objection to admit , my Lord , ’
232837	232865	232834	232835	Serjeant Snubbin	566	‘ if it will save the examination of another witness , that Mr. Pickwick has retired from business , and is a gentleman of considerable independent property . ’
232866	232870	232872	232873	Serjeant Buzfuz	601	‘ Very well , ’
232884	232894	232872	232873	Serjeant Buzfuz	601	‘ then that ’s my case , my Lord . ’

233310	233319	233305	233308	the individual in black	6245	‘ are you all agreed upon your verdict ? ’
233320	233324	233326	233327	the foreman	5977	‘ We are , ’
233329	233344	233326	233327	the foreman	5977	‘ Do you find for the plaintiff , gentlemen , or for the defendant ? ’
233349	233350	233326	233327	the foreman	5977	’ ‘
233357	233358	233305	233308	the individual in black	6245	’ ‘
233365	233471	233305	233308	the individual in black	6245	’ Mr. Pickwick took off his spectacles , carefully wiped the glasses , folded them into their case , and put them in his pocket ; then , having drawn on his gloves with great nicety , and stared at the foreman all the while , he mechanically followed Mr. Perker and the blue bag out of court . They stopped in a side room while Perker paid the court fees ; and here , Mr. Pickwick was joined by his friends . Here , too , he encountered Messrs. Dodson & amp ; Fogg , rubbing their hands with every token of outward satisfaction . ‘
233476	233481	233474	233474	gentlemen	10163	’ said Mr. Pickwick . ‘
233486	233495	233484	233484	Sir	9716	’ said Dodson , for self and partner . ‘
233510	233532	233508	233508	gentlemen	10163	’ said Mr. Pickwick . Fogg said they thought it rather probable . Dodson smiled , and said they ’d try . ‘
233549	233555	233533	233533	You	9716	’ said Mr. Pickwick vehemently , ‘
233585	233586	233614	233614	he	6254	’ ‘
233591	233595	233614	233614	he	6254	’ laughed Dodson . ‘
233610	233611	233612	233612	He	6254	’ ‘
233628	233736	233625	233626	Mr. Pickwick	240	’ grinned Fogg . Speechless with indignation , Mr. Pickwick allowed himself to be led by his solicitor and friends to the door , and there assisted into a hackney - coach , which had been fetched for the purpose , by the ever- watchful Sam Weller . Sam had put up the steps , and was preparing to jump upon the box , when he felt himself gently touched on the shoulder ; and , looking round , his father stood before him . The old gentleman ’s countenance wore a mournful expression , as he shook his head gravely , and said , in warning accents-- ‘
233740	233744	233625	233626	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ ud come o ’
233749	233765	233625	233626	Mr. Pickwick	240	’ doin’ bisness . Oh , Sammy , Sammy , vy worn’t there a alleybi ! ’
233792	233812	233814	233814	you	240	’ said little Perker , as he stood in Mr. Pickwick ’s apartment on the morning after the trial , ‘
233839	233840	233830	233830	you	240	’ ‘
233845	233851	233830	233830	you	240	’ said Mr. Pickwick firmly ; ‘
233856	233857	233864	233867	the money - lender	6257	’ ‘
233876	233890	233891	233891	Sam	356	’ observed Mr. Weller , who was clearing away the breakfast - things . ‘
233893	233898	233891	233891	Sam	356	’ said Mr. Pickwick , ‘
233906	233907	233891	233891	Sam	356	’ ‘
233912	233929	233910	233910	sir	9716	’ replied Mr. Weller ; and acting on Mr. Pickwick ’s gentle hint , Sam retired . ‘
233934	233945	233932	233932	Perker	362	’ said Mr. Pickwick , with great seriousness of manner , ‘
234023	234024	234025	234025	They	11444	’ ‘
234047	234051	234025	234025	They	11444	’ replied Perker , ‘

234066	234071	234025	234025	They	11444	’ said Mr. Pickwick . ‘
234092	234123	234025	234025	They	11444	’ continued Mr. Pickwick , looking round on his friends with a good - humoured smile , and a sparkle in the eye which no spectacles could dim or conceal , ‘
234135	234186	234025	234025	They	11444	’ Mr. Tupman and Mr. Snodgrass were too much affected by their friend ’s heroism to offer any reply . Mr. Winkle had not yet sufficiently recovered the recollection of his evidence at the trial , to make any observation on any subject , so Mr. Pickwick paused in vain . ‘
234189	234194	234196	234196	you	1228	’ said that gentleman , ‘
234218	234355	234208	234208	I	0	’ Nobody had ; and as the proposition was warmly seconded by Perker , who considered it extremely probable that if Mr. Pickwick saw a little change and gaiety he would be inclined to think better of his determination , and worse of a debtor ’s prison , it was carried unanimously ; and Sam was at once despatched to the White Horse Cellar , to take five places by the half - past seven o’clock coach , next morning . There were just two places to be had inside , and just three to be had out ; so Sam Weller booked for them all , and having exchanged a few compliments with the booking - office clerk on the subject of a pewter half - crown which was tendered him as a portion of his ‘

The next was a very unpropitious morning for a journey -- muggy , damp , and drizzly . The horses in the stages that were going out , and had come through the city , were smoking so , that the outside passengers were invisible . The newspaper - sellers looked moist , and smelled mouldy ; the wet ran off the hats of the orange - vendors as they thrust their heads into the coach windows , and diluted the insides in a refreshing manner . The Jews with the fifty - bladed penknives shut them up in despair ; the men with the pocket - books made pocket - books of them . Watch - guards and toasting - forks were alike at a discount , and pencil - cases and sponges were a drug in the market . Leaving Sam Weller to rescue the luggage from the seven or eight porters who flung themselves savagely upon it , the moment the coach stopped , and finding that they were about twenty minutes too early , Mr. Pickwick and his friends went for shelter into the travellers ’

234910	234915	234889	234908	a man with a dirty complexion , and a towel of the same , emerging from the kennel before mentioned	6283	‘ Some more toast . ’
234916	234921	234878	234882	the gentleman with the whiskers	6282	‘ Yes , sir . ’

234992	235003	235005	235006	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I wonder whereabouts in Bath this coach puts up , ’

235028	235039	235041	235042	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I made an observation to my friend , sir , ’
235051	235069	235041	235042	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I wondered at what house the Bath coach put up . Perhaps you can inform me . ’

If they try to squeeze six people into an infernal box that only holds four , I ’ll take a post - chaise and bring an action . I ’ve paid my fare . It wo n’t do ; I told the clerk when I took my places that it would n’t do . I know these things have been done . I know they are done every day ; but I never was done , and I never will be . Those who know me best , best know it ; crush me ! ’
235292	235297	235299	235300	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ My good sir , ’
235302	235328	235299	235300	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ you will allow me to observe that this is a very unnecessary display of excitement . I have only taken places inside for two . ’

235551	235562	235548	235549	Mr. Dowler	626	‘ I am proud of her . I have reason . ’
235563	235574	235576	235577	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I hope I shall have the pleasure of judging , ’
235583	235587	235589	235589	Dowler	626	‘ You shall , ’
235591	235659	235589	235589	Dowler	626	‘ She shall know you . She shall esteem you . I courted her under singular circumstances . I won her through a rash vow . Thus . I saw her ; I loved her ; I proposed ; she refused me.--“You love another?”--“Spare my blushes . ”--“I know him . ”--“You do . ”--“Very good ; if he remains here , I ’ll skin him . ” ’
235660	235665	235667	235668	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Lord bless me ! ’
235671	235680	235682	235683	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ Did you skin the gentleman , Sir ? ’
235691	235711	235682	235683	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ I wrote him a note , I said it was a painful thing . And so it was . ’
235712	235715	235717	235718	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ Certainly , ’
235720	235807	235717	235718	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ I said I had pledged my word as a gentleman to skin him . My character was at stake . I had no alternative . As an officer in His Majesty ’s service , I was bound to skin him . I regretted the necessity , but it must be done . He was open to conviction . He saw that the rules of the service were imperative . He fled . I married her . Here ’s the coach . That ’s her head . ’
235947	235952	235954	235955	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Well , Sam , ’
235957	235964	235954	235955	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ what ’s the matter now ? ’
235965	235975	235977	235977	Sam	240	‘ Here ’s rayther a rum go , sir , ’
235979	235982	235984	235985	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ What ? ’
235987	235993	235995	235995	Sam	240	‘ This here , Sir , ’
235997	235999	235995	235995	Sam	240	‘ I ’m
236010	236017	235984	235985	Mr. Pickwick	240	’ this here coach is a playin ’
236023	236024	235984	235985	Mr. Pickwick	240	’ ‘
236031	236036	236029	236029	Sam	240	’ said Mr. Pickwick ; ‘
236048	236049	236029	236029	Sam	240	’ ‘
236064	236068	236062	236062	Sir	9716	’ replied Sam , ‘
236075	236083	236070	236070	they	6314	‘ em up , on the door o ’
236087	236133	236070	236070	they	6314	’ As Sam spoke , he pointed to that part of the coach door on which the proprietor ’s name usually appears ; and there , sure enough , in gilt letters of a goodly size , was the magic name of _ Pickwick _ ! ‘
236137	236148	236070	236070	they	6314	’ exclaimed Mr. Pickwick , quite staggered by the coincidence ; ‘
236155	236156	236070	236070	they	6314	’ ‘
236165	236180	236070	236070	they	6314	’ said Sam , again directing his master ’s attention to the coach door ; ‘
236185	236205	236070	236070	they	6314	’ up “ Pick - wick , ” they puts “ Moses ” afore it , vich I call addin ’
236234	236235	236215	236215	they	6314	’ ‘
236245	236250	236243	236243	Sam	240	’ said Mr. Pickwick ; ‘
236264	236265	236243	236243	Sam	240	’ ‘
236279	236298	236243	236243	Sam	240	’ exclaimed Sam , perfectly aghast at the coolness with which Mr. Pickwick prepared to ensconce himself inside . ‘
236301	236306	236243	236243	Sam	240	’ said Mr. Pickwick . ‘
236312	236321	236243	236243	Sam	240	’ Ai n’t nobody to be whopped for takin ’
236328	236359	236326	236326	sir	9716	’ said Mr. Weller , who had expected that at least he would have been commissioned to challenge the guard and the coachman to a pugilistic encounter on the spot . ‘
236363	236369	236326	236326	sir	9716	’ replied Mr. Pickwick eagerly ; ‘
236382	236383	236384	236384	I	0	’ ‘
236390	236401	236386	236386	wery	6321	’ muttered Sam to himself , as he turned away , ‘
236416	236425	236386	236386	wery	6321	’ stood this so quiet . I hope that ‘
236442	236821	236439	236439	wery	6321	’ Mr. Weller shook his head gravely ; and it is worthy of remark , as an illustration of the manner in which he took this circumstance to heart , that he did not speak another word until the coach reached the Kensington turnpike . Which was so long a time for him to remain taciturn , that the fact may be considered wholly unprecedented . Nothing worthy of special mention occurred during the journey . Mr. Dowler related a variety of anecdotes , all illustrative of his own personal prowess and desperation , and appealed to Mrs. Dowler in corroboration thereof ; when Mrs. Dowler invariably brought in , in the form of an appendix , some remarkable fact or circumstance which Mr. Dowler had forgotten , or had perhaps through modesty , omitted ; for the addenda in every instance went to show that Mr. Dowler was even a more wonderful fellow than he made himself out to be . Mr. Pickwick and Mr. Winkle listened with great admiration , and at intervals conversed with Mrs. Dowler , who was a very agreeable and fascinating person . So , what between Mr. Dowler ’s stories , and Mrs. Dowler ’s charms , and Mr. Pickwick ’s good - humour , and Mr. Winkle ’s good listening , the insides contrived to be very companionable all the way . The outsides did as outsides always do . They were very cheerful and talkative at the beginning of every stage , and very dismal and sleepy in the middle , and very bright and wakeful again towards the end . There was one young gentleman in an India - rubber cloak , who smoked cigars all day ; and there was another young gentleman in a parody upon a greatcoat , who lighted a good many , and feeling obviously unsettled after the second whiff , threw them away when he thought nobody was looking at him . There was a third young man on the box who wished to be learned in cattle ; and an old one behind , who was familiar with farming . There was a constant succession of Christian names in smock - frocks and white coats , who were invited to have a ‘
236823	237143	237146	237146	his	6323	’ by the guard , and who knew every horse and hostler on the road and off it ; and there was a dinner which would have been cheap at half - a - crown a mouth , if any moderate number of mouths could have eaten it in the time . And at seven o’clock P.M. Mr. Pickwick and his friends , and Mr. Dowler and his wife , respectively retired to their private sitting - rooms at the White Hart Hotel , opposite the Great Pump Room , Bath , where the waiters , from their costume , might be mistaken for Westminster boys , only they destroy the illusion by behaving themselves much better . Breakfast had scarcely been cleared away on the succeeding morning , when a waiter brought in Mr. Dowler ’s card , with a request to be allowed permission to introduce a friend . Mr. Dowler at once followed up the delivery of the card , by bringing himself and the friend also . The friend was a charming young man of not much more than fifty , dressed in a very bright blue coat with resplendent buttons , black trousers , and the thinnest possible pair of highly - polished boots . A gold eye - glass was suspended from his neck by a short , broad , black ribbon ; a gold snuff - box was lightly clasped in his left hand ; gold rings innumerable glittered on his fingers ; and a large diamond pin set in gold glistened in his shirt frill . He had a gold watch , and a gold curb chain with large gold seals ; and he carried a pliant ebony cane with a gold top . His linen was of the very whitest , finest , and stiffest ; his wig of the glossiest , blackest , and curliest . His snuff was princes ’
237187	237191	237193	237194	Mr. Dowler	626	‘ Mr. Pickwick , ’
237196	237217	237193	237194	Mr. Dowler	626	‘ my friend , Angelo Cyrus Bantam , Esquire , M.C. ; Bantam ; Mr. Pickwick . Know each other . ’
237218	237270	237193	237194	Mr. Dowler	626	‘ Welcome to Ba -- ath , Sir . This is indeed an acquisition . Most welcome to Ba -- ath , sir . It is long -- very long , Mr. Pickwick , since you drank the waters . It appears an age , Mr. Pickwick . Re - markable ! ’
237329	237344	237346	237347	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ It is a very long time since I drank the waters , certainly , ’
237349	237365	237346	237347	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ for , to the best of my knowledge , I was never here before . ’
237366	237376	237378	237380	the Grand Master	6325	‘ Never in Ba -- ath , Mr. Pickwick ! ’
237389	237428	237378	237380	the Grand Master	6325	‘ Never in Ba -- ath ! He ! he ! Mr. Pickwick , you are a wag . Not bad , not bad . Good , good . He ! he ! he ! Re - markable ! ’
237429	237443	237445	237446	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ To my shame , I must say that I am perfectly serious , ’
237448	237456	237445	237446	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I really never was here before . ’
237457	237463	237465	237467	the Grand Master	6325	‘ Oh , I see , ’
237473	237509	237465	237467	the Grand Master	6325	‘ yes , yes -- good , good -- better and better . You are the gentleman of whom we have heard . Yes ; we know you , Mr. Pickwick ; we know you . ’
237510	237521	237523	237524	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ The reports of the trial in those confounded papers , ’
237526	237534	237523	237524	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ They have heard all about me . ’
237544	237548	237465	237467	the Grand Master	6325	’ resumed Bantam , ‘
237618	237683	237684	237684	Bantam	630	’ Mr. Pickwick acknowledged the compliment which the supposition implied , but had the self - denial to repudiate it , notwithstanding ; and taking advantage of a moment ’s silence on the part of the M.C. , begged to introduce his friends , Mr. Tupman , Mr. Winkle , and Mr. Snodgrass . An introduction which overwhelmed the M.C. with delight and honour . ‘
237686	237691	237684	237684	Bantam	630	’ said Mr. Dowler , ‘
237712	237713	237684	237684	Bantam	630	’ ‘
237736	237740	237742	237742	you	6338	’ replied the M.C. ‘
237759	237760	237761	237761	I	0	’ ‘
237764	237768	237761	237761	I	0	’ rejoined Dowler . ‘
237792	237793	237761	237761	I	0	’ ‘
237801	237819	237761	237761	I	0	’ said the M.C. , again taking Mr. Pickwick ’s hand , as he rose to go . ‘
237898	238226	238325	238325	he	356	’ and protesting all the way downstairs that he was most satisfied , and most delighted , and most overpowered , and most flattered , Angelo Cyrus Bantam , Esquire , M.C. , stepped into a very elegant chariot that waited at the door , and rattled off . At the appointed hour , Mr. Pickwick and his friends , escorted by Dowler , repaired to the Assembly Rooms , and wrote their names down in the book-- an instance of condescension at which Angelo Bantam was even more overpowered than before . Tickets of admission to that evening ’s assembly were to have been prepared for the whole party , but as they were not ready , Mr. Pickwick undertook , despite all the protestations to the contrary of Angelo Bantam , to send Sam for them at four o’clock in the afternoon , to the M.C. ’s house in Queen Square . Having taken a short walk through the city , and arrived at the unanimous conclusion that Park Street was very much like the perpendicular streets a man sees in a dream , which he can not get up for the life of him , they returned to the White Hart , and despatched Sam on the errand to which his master had pledged him . Sam Weller put on his hat in a very easy and graceful manner , and , thrusting his hands in his waistcoat pockets , walked with great deliberation to Queen Square , whistling as he went along , several of the most popular airs of the day , as arranged with entirely new movements for that noble instrument the organ , either mouth or barrel . Arriving at the number in Queen Square to which he had been directed , he left off whistling and gave a cheerful knock , which was instantaneously answered by a powdered - headed footman in gorgeous livery , and of symmetrical stature . ‘
238237	238268	238230	238231	Mr. Bantam	632	’ inquired Sam Weller , nothing abashed by the blaze of splendour which burst upon his sight in the person of the powdered - headed footman with the gorgeous livery . ‘
238274	238286	238230	238231	Mr. Bantam	632	’ was the haughty inquiry of the powdered - headed footman . ‘
238287	238300	238325	238325	he	356	’Cos if it is , jist you step in to him with that ‘
238312	238317	238319	238319	Sam	356	’ , will you ? ’
238427	238431	238433	238433	Sam	356	‘ Wery good , ’
238435	238461	238433	238433	Sam	356	‘ Tell the old gen’l’m’n not to put himself in a perspiration . No hurry , six - foot . I ’ve had my dinner . ’
238462	238469	238471	238475	the powdered - headed footman	15186	‘ You dine early , sir , ’
238477	238490	238492	238492	Sam	356	‘ I find I gets on better at supper when I does , ’
238494	238504	238506	238510	the powdered - headed footman	15186	‘ Have you been long in Bath , sir ? ’
238512	238525	238506	238510	the powdered - headed footman	15186	‘ I have not had the pleasure of hearing of you before . ’
238526	238534	238471	238475	the powdered - headed footman	15186	‘ I have n’t created any wery surprisin ’
238541	238545	238471	238475	the powdered - headed footman	15186	’ rejoined Sam , ‘

238564	238572	238562	238562	Sir	9716	’ said the powdered - headed footman . ‘
238576	238580	238584	238584	sir	9716	’ observed Sam . ‘
238586	238594	238584	238584	sir	9716	’ remarked the powdered - headed footman . ‘
238601	238602	238599	238599	sir	9716	’ ‘
238609	238613	238616	238616	unaffected	6357	’ replied Sam . ‘
238624	238627	238641	238645	the powdered - headed footman	15186	’ fellers . ’
238628	238639	238641	238645	the powdered - headed footman	15186	‘ Oh , very much so , indeed , sir , ’
238656	238672	238674	238676	the tall footman	6359	‘ Very much so indeed . Do you do anything in this way , Sir ? ’
238695	238700	238702	238702	Sam	356	‘ Not without sneezing , ’
238704	238718	238720	238722	the tall footman	6359	‘ Why , it _ is _ difficult , sir , I confess , ’
238724	238759	238720	238722	the tall footman	6359	‘ It may be done by degrees , Sir . Coffee is the best practice . I carried coffee , Sir , for a long time . It looks very like rappee , sir . ’
238798	238801	238845	238849	the powdered - headed footman	15186	‘ study . ’
238835	238843	238845	238849	the powdered - headed footman	15186	‘ There is the answer , sir , ’

238869	238881	238845	238849	the powdered - headed footman	15186	’ said Sam , taking a letter with a small enclosure . ‘
238889	238896	238909	238913	the powdered - headed footman	15186	’ may manage to surwive it . ’
238897	238907	238909	238913	the powdered - headed footman	15186	‘ I hope we shall meet again , Sir , ’
238929	238934	238909	238913	the powdered - headed footman	15186	‘ You are wery obligin ’
238938	238942	238936	238936	sir	9716	’ replied Sam . ‘
238961	238986	238909	238913	the powdered - headed footman	15186	’ . Consider what you owe to society , and do n’t let yourself be injured by too much work . For the sake o ’
239009	239019	239020	239024	A very singular young man	6369	’ With these pathetic words , Sam Weller departed . ‘
239027	239814	239020	239024	A very singular young man	6369	’ said the powdered - headed footman , looking after Mr. Weller , with a countenance which clearly showed he could make nothing of him . Sam said nothing at all . He winked , shook his head , smiled , winked again ; and , with an expression of countenance which seemed to denote that he was greatly amused with something or other , walked merrily away . At precisely twenty minutes before eight o’clock that night , Angelo Cyrus Bantam , Esq . , the Master of the Ceremonies , emerged from his chariot at the door of the Assembly Rooms in the same wig , the same teeth , the same eye - glass , the same watch and seals , the same rings , the same shirt - pin , and the same cane . The only observable alterations in his appearance were , that he wore a brighter blue coat , with a white silk lining , black tights , black silk stockings , and pumps , and a white waistcoat , and was , if possible , just a thought more scented . Thus attired , the Master of the Ceremonies , in strict discharge of the important duties of his all - important office , planted himself in the room to receive the company . Bath being full , the company , and the sixpences for tea , poured in , in shoals . In the ballroom , the long card - room , the octagonal card - room , the staircases , and the passages , the hum of many voices , and the sound of many feet , were perfectly bewildering . Dresses rustled , feathers waved , lights shone , and jewels sparkled . There was the music -- not of the quadrille band , for it had not yet commenced ; but the music of soft , tiny footsteps , with now and then a clear , merry laugh -- low and gentle , but very pleasant to hear in a female voice , whether in Bath or elsewhere . Brilliant eyes , lighted up with pleasurable expectation , gleamed from every side ; and , look where you would , some exquisite form glided gracefully through the throng , and was no sooner lost , than it was replaced by another as dainty and bewitching . In the tea - room , and hovering round the card - tables , were a vast number of queer old ladies , and decrepit old gentlemen , discussing all the small talk and scandal of the day , with a relish and gusto which sufficiently bespoke the intensity of the pleasure they derived from the occupation . Mingled with these groups , were three or four match - making mammas , appearing to be wholly absorbed by the conversation in which they were taking part , but failing not from time to time to cast an anxious sidelong glance upon their daughters , who , remembering the maternal injunction to make the best use of their youth , had already commenced incipient flirtations in the mislaying scarves , putting on gloves , setting down cups , and so forth ; slight matters apparently , but which may be turned to surprisingly good account by expert practitioners . Lounging near the doors , and in remote corners , were various knots of silly young men , displaying various varieties of puppyism and stupidity ; amusing all sensible people near them with their folly and conceit ; and happily thinking themselves the objects of general admiration -- a wise and merciful dispensation which no good man will quarrel with . And lastly , seated on some of the back benches , where they had already taken up their positions for the evening , were divers unmarried ladies past their grand climacteric , who , not dancing because there were no partners for them , and not playing cards lest they should be set down as irretrievably single , were in the favourable situation of being able to abuse everybody without reflecting on themselves . In short , they could abuse everybody , because everybody was there . It was a scene of gaiety , glitter , and show ; of richly - dressed people , handsome mirrors , chalked floors , girandoles and wax - candles ; and in all parts of the scene , gliding from spot to spot in silent softness , bowing obsequiously to this party , nodding familiarly to that , and smiling complacently on all , was the sprucely - attired person of Angelo Cyrus Bantam , Esquire , the Master of the Ceremonies . ‘
239840	239900	239901	239901	My	0	’ said Mr. Dowler , in a loud voice , directing Mr. Pickwick , who advanced at the head of the little party , with Mrs. Dowler on his arm . Into the tea - room Mr. Pickwick turned ; and catching sight of him , Mr. Bantam corkscrewed his way through the crowd and welcomed him with ecstasy . ‘
239934	239935	239924	239924	I	0	’ ‘
239939	239944	239945	239945	Anybody	851	’ inquired Dowler suspiciously . ‘
239970	239971	239972	239975	The fat old lady	6377	’ ‘
239977	239983	239972	239975	The fat old lady	6377	’ inquired Mr. Pickwick innocently . ‘
240007	240008	240002	240005	the Dowager Lady Snuphanuph	6381	’ ‘
240014	240019	240022	240023	a person	4499	’ said Mr. Pickwick . ‘

240174	240179	240172	240172	Bantam	6389	’ said his Lordship . ‘
240190	240194	240187	240188	my Lord	12992	’ replied the M.C. ‘
240197	240204	240187	240188	my Lord	12992	’ assented the Honourable Mr. Crushton . ‘
240217	240260	240215	240215	Bantam	632	’ inquired the Honourable Mr. Crushton , after a short pause , during which young Lord Mutanhed had been endeavouring to stare Mr. Pickwick out of countenance , and Mr. Crushton had been reflecting what subject his Lordship could talk about best . ‘
240266	240270	240215	240215	Bantam	632	’ replied the M.C. ‘
240285	240286	240215	240215	Bantam	632	’ ‘
240290	240295	240296	240296	I	0	’ said his Lordship , ‘
240331	240332	240323	240323	we	6393	’ ‘
240345	240352	240323	240323	we	6393	’ said the Honourable Mr. Crushton . ‘
240369	240374	240375	240375	I	0	’ added his Lordship . ‘
240433	240469	240470	240472	Delightful young man	6399	’ At this anecdote his Lordship laughed very heartily , as did the listeners , of course . Then , drawing his arm through that of the obsequious Mr. Crushton , Lord Mutanhed walked away . ‘
240477	240485	240470	240472	Delightful young man	6399	’ said the Master of the Ceremonies . ‘
240491	240605	240487	240487	I	0	’ rejoined Mr. Pickwick drily . The dancing having commenced , the necessary introductions having been made , and all preliminaries arranged , Angelo Bantam rejoined Mr. Pickwick , and led him into the card - room . Just at the very moment of their entrance , the Dowager Lady Snuphanuph and two other ladies of an ancient and whist - like appearance , were hovering over an unoccupied card - table ; and they no sooner set eyes upon Mr. Pickwick under the convoy of Angelo Bantam , than they exchanged glances with each other , seeing that he was precisely the very person they wanted , to make up the rubber . ‘
240610	240618	240608	240608	Bantam	630	’ said the Dowager Lady Snuphanuph coaxingly , ‘
240636	240662	240632	240634	a good soul	13814	’ Mr. Pickwick happened to be looking another way at the moment , so her Ladyship nodded her head towards him , and frowned expressively . ‘
240683	240692	240676	240676	I	0	’ said the M.C. , taking the hint . ‘
240706	240785	240703	240704	Miss Bolo	6406	’ Mr. Pickwick bowed to each of the ladies , and , finding escape impossible , cut . Mr. Pickwick and Miss Bolo against Lady Snuphanuph and Mrs. Colonel Wugsby . As the trump card was turned up , at the commencement of the second deal , two young ladies hurried into the room , and took their stations on either side of Mrs. Colonel Wugsby ’s chair , where they waited patiently until the hand was over . ‘
240790	240803	240788	240788	Jane	306	’ said Mrs. Colonel Wugsby , turning to one of the girls , ‘
240808	240826	240828	240834	the prettier and younger of the two	6407	’ I came to ask , ma , whether I might dance with the youngest Mr. Crawley , ’
240836	240850	240852	240853	the mamma	6409	‘ Good God , Jane , how can you think of such things ? ’
240856	240887	240852	240853	the mamma	6409	‘ Have n’t you repeatedly heard that his father has eight hundred a year , which dies with him ? I am ashamed of you . Not on any account . ’
240888	240891	240893	240908	the other , who was much older than her sister , and very insipid and artificial	6410	‘ Ma , ’
240910	240930	240893	240908	the other , who was much older than her sister , and very insipid and artificial	6410	‘ Lord Mutanhed has been introduced to me . I said I thought I was n’t engaged , ma . ’
240931	240933	240893	240908	the other , who was much older than her sister , and very insipid and artificial	6410	‘ You ’re
240941	240956	240893	240908	the other , who was much older than her sister , and very insipid and artificial	6410	’ replied Mrs. Colonel Wugsby , tapping her daughter ’s cheek with her fan , ‘
240975	241523	240973	240973	you	10214	’ With these words Mrs. Colonel Wugsby kissed her eldest daughter most affectionately , and frowning in a warning manner upon the other , sorted her cards . Poor Mr. Pickwick ! he had never played with three thorough - paced female card - players before . They were so desperately sharp , that they quite frightened him . If he played a wrong card , Miss Bolo looked a small armoury of daggers ; if he stopped to consider which was the right one , Lady Snuphanuph would throw herself back in her chair , and smile with a mingled glance of impatience and pity to Mrs. Colonel Wugsby , at which Mrs. Colonel Wugsby would shrug up her shoulders , and cough , as much as to say she wondered whether he ever would begin . Then , at the end of every hand , Miss Bolo would inquire with a dismal countenance and reproachful sigh , why Mr. Pickwick had not returned that diamond , or led the club , or roughed the spade , or finessed the heart , or led through the honour , or brought out the ace , or played up to the king , or some such thing ; and in reply to all these grave charges , Mr. Pickwick would be wholly unable to plead any justification whatever , having by this time forgotten all about the game . People came and looked on , too , which made Mr. Pickwick nervous . Besides all this , there was a great deal of distracting conversation near the table , between Angelo Bantam and the two Misses Matinter , who , being single and singular , paid great court to the Master of the Ceremonies , in the hope of getting a stray partner now and then . All these things , combined with the noises and interruptions of constant comings in and goings out , made Mr. Pickwick play rather badly ; the cards were against him , also ; and when they left off at ten minutes past eleven , Miss Bolo rose from the table considerably agitated , and went straight home , in a flood of tears and a sedan - chair . Being joined by his friends , who one and all protested that they had scarcely ever spent a more pleasant evening , Mr. Pickwick accompanied them to the White Hart , and having soothed his feelings with something hot , went to bed , and to sleep , almost simultaneously . CHAPTER XXXVI . THE CHIEF FEATURES OF WHICH WILL BE FOUND TO BE AN AUTHENTIC VERSION OF THE LEGEND OF PRINCE BLADUD , AND A MOST EXTRAORDINARY CALAMITY THAT BEFELL MR . WINKLE As Mr. Pickwick contemplated a stay of at least two months in Bath , he deemed it advisable to take private lodgings for himself and friends for that period ; and as a favourable opportunity offered for their securing , on moderate terms , the upper portion of a house in the Royal Crescent , which was larger than they required , Mr. and Mrs. Dowler offered to relieve them of a bedroom and sitting - room . This proposition was at once accepted , and in three days ’
242114	242121	242123	242124	Mrs. Craddock	643	‘ Beg your pardon , Sir , ’
242132	242142	242123	242124	Mrs. Craddock	643	‘ but did you want anything more , sir ? ’
242143	242149	242151	242152	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Nothing more , ma’am , ’
242154	242165	242167	242168	Mrs. Craddock	643	‘ My young girl is gone to bed , Sir , ’
242170	242220	242167	242168	Mrs. Craddock	643	‘ and Mr. Dowler is good enough to say that he ’ll sit up for Mrs. Dowler , as the party is n’t expected to be over till late ; so I was thinking that if you wanted nothing more , Mr. Pickwick , I would go to bed . ’
242221	242228	242230	242231	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ By all means , ma’am , ’
242233	242242	242244	242245	Mrs. Craddock	643	‘ Wish you good - night , Sir , ’
242247	242254	242256	242257	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Good - night , ma’am , ’
242438	242478	242423	242423	his	240	‘ Less than two hundred years ago , on one of the public baths in this city , there appeared an inscription in honour of its mighty founder , the renowned Prince Bladud . That inscription is now erased . ‘
242631	242778	242779	242779	He	6457	‘ This sagacious pig was fond of bathing in rich , moist mud . Not in summer , as common pigs do now , to cool themselves , and did even in those distant ages ( which is a proof that the light of civilisation had already begun to dawn , though feebly ) , but in the cold , sharp days of winter . His coat was ever so sleek , and his complexion so clear , that the prince resolved to essay the purifying qualities of the same water that his friend resorted to . He made the trial . Beneath that black mud , bubbled the hot springs of Bath . He washed , and was cured . Hastening to his father ’s court , he paid his best respects , and returning quickly hither , founded this city and its famous baths . ‘
242840	242852	242827	242827	Pliny	646	‘ This was the legend . Listen to the true one . ‘
242994	243132	242984	242987	the venerable King Cole	6474	‘ This good king had a queen , who eighteen years before , had had a son , who was called Bladud . He was sent to a preparatory seminary in his father ’s dominions until he was ten years old , and was then despatched , in charge of a trusty messenger , to a finishing school at Athens ; and as there was no extra charge for remaining during the holidays , and no notice required previous to the removal of a pupil , there he remained for eight long years , at the expiration of which time , the king his father sent the lord chamberlain over , to settle the bill , and to bring him home ; which , the lord chamberlain doing , was received with shouts , and pensioned immediately . ‘
243344	243525	243335	243336	Prince Bladud	645	‘ This answer no sooner reached Britain , than the whole nation was transported with joy . Nothing was heard , on all sides , but the sounds of feasting and revelry -- except the chinking of money as it was paid in by the people to the collector of the royal treasures , to defray the expenses of the happy ceremony . It was upon this occasion that King Lud , seated on the top of his throne in full council , rose , in the exuberance of his feelings , and commanded the lord chief justice to order in the richest wines and the court minstrels -- an act of graciousness which has been , through the ignorance of traditionary historians , attributed to King Cole , in those celebrated lines in which his Majesty is represented as Calling for his pipe , and calling for his pot , And calling for his fiddlers three . Which is an obvious injustice to the memory of King Lud , and a dishonest exaltation of the virtues of King Cole . ‘
243656	243800	243652	243654	a noble Athenian	6498	‘ Here we have a striking example of one of the manifold advantages of civilisation and refinement . If the prince had lived in later days , he might at once have married the object of his father ’s choice , and then set himself seriously to work , to relieve himself of the burden which rested heavily upon him . He might have endeavoured to break her heart by a systematic course of insult and neglect ; or , if the spirit of her sex , and a proud consciousness of her many wrongs had upheld her under this ill - treatment , he might have sought to take her life , and so get rid of her effectually . But neither mode of relief suggested itself to Prince Bladud ; so he solicited a private audience , and told his father . ‘
243927	244030	244031	244032	The monarch	6507	‘ When Prince Bladud had been shut up in the lofty turret for the greater part of a year , with no better prospect before his bodily eyes than a stone wall , or before his mental vision than prolonged imprisonment , he naturally began to ruminate on a plan of escape , which , after months of preparation , he managed to accomplish ; considerately leaving his dinner- knife in the heart of his jailer , lest the poor fellow ( who had a family ) should be considered privy to his flight , and punished accordingly by the infuriated king . ‘
244078	244171	244068	244068	he	6507	‘ Meanwhile , the young prince , effectually disguised , wandered on foot through his father ’s dominions , cheered and supported in all his hardships by sweet thoughts of the Athenian maid , who was the innocent cause of his weary trials . One day he stopped to rest in a country village ; and seeing that there were gay dances going forward on the green , and gay faces passing to and fro , ventured to inquire of a reveller who stood near him , the reason for this rejoicing . ‘
244196	244240	244246	244247	the peasant	6514	‘ “ Proclamation ! No . What proclamation ? ” rejoined the prince -- for he had travelled along the by and little - frequented ways , and knew nothing of what had passed upon the public roads , such as they were . ‘
244327	244429	244323	244324	the king	13168	‘ The prince remained to hear no more . He fled from the spot , and plunged into the thickest recesses of a neighbouring wood . On , on , he wandered , night and day ; beneath the blazing sun , and the cold pale moon ; through the dry heat of noon , and the damp cold of night ; in the gray light of morn , and the red glare of eve . So heedless was he of time or object , that being bound for Athens , he wandered as far out of his way as Bath . ‘
244554	244611	244623	244625	the heathen deities	6535	‘ “ Oh ! ” said the unhappy Bladud , clasping his hands , and mournfully raising his eyes towards the sky , “ would that my wanderings might end here ! Would that these grateful tears with which I now mourn hope misplaced , and love despised , might flow in peace for ever ! ” ‘
244695	244774	244775	244776	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ It is observable that , to this day , large numbers of elderly ladies and gentlemen who have been disappointed in procuring partners , and almost as many young ones who are anxious to obtain them , repair annually to Bath to drink the waters , from which they derive much strength and comfort . This is most complimentary to the virtue of Prince Bladud ’s tears , and strongly corroborative of the veracity of this legend . ’
244846	244849	244851	244851	Dowler	626	‘ Ah ! ’
244853	244872	244851	244851	Dowler	626	‘ going to bed ? I wish I was . Dismal night . Windy ; is n’t it ? ’
244873	244876	244878	244879	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Very , ’
244881	244886	244878	244879	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Good - night . ’
244887	244892	244893	244894	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Good - night . ’
245280	245282	245283	245285	a heavy sleeper	6551	‘ I ’m
245287	245300	245301	245301	I	0	’ said Mr. Dowler , as he flung himself on the bed . ‘
245348	245497	245498	245498	Servants	11976	’ When Mr. Dowler arrived at this point , he turned the corner at which he had been long hesitating , and fell fast asleep . Just as the clock struck three , there was blown into the crescent a sedan - chair with Mrs. Dowler inside , borne by one short , fat chairman , and one long , thin one , who had had much ado to keep their bodies perpendicular : to say nothing of the chair . But on that high ground , and in the crescent , which the wind swept round and round as if it were going to tear the paving stones up , its fury was tremendous . They were very glad to set the chair down , and give a good round loud double - knock at the street door . They waited some time , but nobody came . ‘
245504	245510	245512	245514	the short chairman	6554	’ Porpus , I think , ’
245528	245534	245517	245517	his	6554	‘ I wish he ’d give ‘
245540	245543	245545	245547	the long one	6556	‘ em , ’
245549	245560	245562	245563	Mrs. Dowler	627	‘ Knock again , will you , if you please , ’
245568	245579	245562	245563	Mrs. Dowler	627	‘ Knock two or three times , if you please . ’
245656	245660	245662	245663	Mrs. Dowler	627	‘ Dear me ! ’
245665	245675	245662	245663	Mrs. Dowler	627	‘ You must knock again , if you please . ’
245687	245693	245662	245663	Mrs. Dowler	627	’ said the short chairman . ‘
245699	245706	245662	245663	Mrs. Dowler	627	’ interposed the link - boy , ‘
245719	245720	245707	245707	I	0	’ ‘
245727	245732	245707	245707	I	0	’ said Mrs. Dowler , ‘

246051	246057	246049	246049	ma’am	10369	’ said the short chairman . ‘
246068	246074	246060	246060	I	0	’ muttered the long one . ‘
246079	246088	246060	246060	I	0	’ cried Mr. Winkle , undoing the chain . ‘
246101	246122	246060	246060	I	0	’ replied the long man , with great disgust , taking it for granted that the inquirer was a footman ; ‘
246128	246129	246060	246060	I	0	’ ‘
246138	246275	246060	246060	I	0	’ added the other encouragingly . Mr. Winkle , being half asleep , obeyed the command mechanically , opened the door a little , and peeped out . The first thing he saw , was the red glare of the link - boy ’s torch . Startled by the sudden fear that the house might be on fire , he hastily threw the door wide open , and holding the candle above his head , stared eagerly before him , not quite certain whether what he saw was a sedan - chair or a fire - engine . At this instant there came a violent gust of wind ; the light was blown out ; Mr. Winkle felt himself irresistibly impelled on to the steps ; and the door blew to , with a loud crash . ‘
246289	246339	246282	246282	you	4923	’ said the short chairman . Mr. Winkle , catching sight of a lady ’s face at the window of the sedan , turned hastily round , plied the knocker with all his might and main , and called frantically upon the chairman to take the chair away again . ‘
246348	246353	246282	246282	you	4923	’ cried Mr. Winkle . ‘
246377	246411	246412	246413	The people	10148	’ All this time he was shivering with cold ; and every time he raised his hand to the knocker , the wind took the dressing - gown in a most unpleasant manner . ‘
246425	246438	246440	246441	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ em ; cover me up with something . Stand before me ! ’
246680	246683	246685	246685	Dowler	626	‘ Watchman , ’
246688	246730	246685	246685	Dowler	626	‘ stop him -- hold him -- keep him tight -- shut him in , till I come down . I ’ll cut his throat -- give me a knife -- from ear to ear , Mrs. Craddock -- I will ! ’

247058	247066	247046	247047	Mrs. Craddock	643	‘ here ’s a letter for you . ’

247117	247122	247046	247047	Mrs. Craddock	643	’ observed Mrs. Craddock . ‘

247145	247154	247046	247047	Mrs. Craddock	643	’ replied Sam , shaking his head dubiously ; ‘

247199	247204	247192	247192	He	356	‘ cos he learnt writin ’

247365	247421	247359	247360	Mr. Weller	356	‘ A select company of the Bath footmen presents their compliments to Mr. Weller , and requests the pleasure of his company this evening , to a friendly swarry , consisting of a boiled leg of mutton with the usual trimmings . The swarry to be on table at half - past nine o’clock punctually . ’
247432	247500	247502	247503	John Smauker	284	‘ Mr. John Smauker , the gentleman who had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Weller at the house of their mutual acquaintance , Mr. Bantam , a few days since , begs to inclose Mr. Weller the herewith invitation . If Mr. Weller will call on Mr. John Smauker at nine o’clock , Mr. John Smauker will have the pleasure of introducing Mr. Weller . ( Signed ) ‘
247506	247537	247502	247503	John Smauker	284	’ The envelope was directed to blank Weller , Esq . , at Mr. Pickwick ’s ; and in a parenthesis , in the left hand corner , were the words ‘
247541	247549	247502	247503	John Smauker	284	’ as an instruction to the bearer . ‘
247552	247556	247502	247503	John Smauker	284	’ said Sam , ‘

With this permission and the street - door key , Sam Weller issued forth a little before the appointed time , and strolled leisurely towards Queen Square , which he no sooner gained than he had the satisfaction of beholding Mr. John Smauker leaning his powdered head against a lamp - post at a short distance off , smoking a cigar through an amber tube . ‘

247866	247876	247864	247864	Sam	356	‘ that ’s a wery bad complaint , that . ’
247877	247889	247891	247893	Mr. John Smauker	284	‘ And yet the temptation , you see , Mr. Weller , ’
247895	247902	247904	247904	Sam	356	‘ Ah , to be sure , ’
247906	247921	247923	247925	Mr. John Smauker	284	‘ Plunged into the very vortex of society , you know , Mr. Weller , ’
247931	247936	247938	247938	Sam	356	‘ Dreadful , indeed ! ’
247940	247948	247950	247952	Mr. John Smauker	284	‘ But it ’s always the way , ’
247954	247986	247950	247952	Mr. John Smauker	284	‘ if your destiny leads you into public life , and public station , you must expect to be subjected to temptations which other people is free from , Mr. Weller . ’
247987	248002	248004	248004	Sam	356	‘ Precisely what my uncle said , ven he vent into the public line , ’
248006	248028	248004	248004	Sam	356	‘ and wery right the old gen’l’m’n wos , for he drank hisself to death in somethin’ less than a quarter . ’
248075	248083	248085	248086	Mr. Smauker	284	‘ Perhaps we had better be walking , ’
248126	248131	248133	248133	Sam	356	‘ P’raps we had , ’
248135	248149	248133	248133	Sam	356	‘ or they ’ll overdo the swarry , and that ’ll spile it . ’
248150	248160	248162	248163	his companion	1041	‘ Have you drank the waters , Mr. Weller ? ’
248172	248175	248177	248177	Sam	356	‘ Once , ’
248179	248185	248177	248177	Sam	356	‘ What did you think of ‘

248264	248271	248261	248262	Mr. Weller	356	’ observed Mr. John Smauker contemptuously . ‘
248289	248293	248261	248262	Mr. Weller	356	’ said Sam . ‘
248315	248334	248310	248310	I	0	’ And here , to the great horror of Mr. John Smauker , Sam Weller began to whistle . ‘
248343	248356	248340	248341	Mr. Weller	356	’ said Mr. John Smauker , agonised at the exceeding ungenteel sound , ‘
248363	248364	248358	248358	you	356	’ ‘
248368	248381	248383	248383	Sam	356	’re wery good , but I wo n’t deprive you of it , ’

248409	248430	248383	248383	Sam	356	’ As Sam said this , he suited the action to the word , and whistled far louder than before . ‘
248434	248452	248383	248383	Sam	356	’ said his new friend , apparently much relieved as they turned down a by - street ; ‘
248459	248460	248462	248462	we	6615	’ ‘
248464	248484	248383	248383	Sam	356	’ said Sam , quite unmoved by the announcement of his close vicinity to the select footmen of Bath . ‘
248487	248493	248383	248383	Sam	356	’ said Mr. John Smauker . ‘
248502	248503	248499	248500	Mr. Weller	356	’ ‘
248508	248512	248499	248500	Mr. Weller	356	’ said Sam . ‘
248524	248530	248521	248522	Mr. Weller	356	’ continued Mr. John Smauker ; ‘
248555	248556	248549	248549	they	10191	’ ‘

248569	248574	248576	248578	Mr. John Smauker	284	‘ And you know , ’
248590	248606	248576	248578	Mr. John Smauker	284	’re a stranger , perhaps , they ’ll be rather hard upon you at first . ’
248607	248620	248622	248622	Sam	356	‘ They wo n’t be wery cruel , though , will they ? ’
248624	248629	248631	248633	Mr. John Smauker	284	‘ No , no , ’
248648	248672	248673	248673	em	10191	‘ There are some funny dogs among us , and they will have their joke , you know ; but you must n’t mind ‘
248679	248682	248631	248633	Mr. John Smauker	284	‘ em . ’
248683	248697	248631	248633	Mr. John Smauker	284	‘ I ’ll try and bear up agin such a reg’lar knock down o ’
248700	248704	248631	248633	Mr. John Smauker	284	’ replied Sam . ‘
248709	248727	248631	248633	Mr. John Smauker	284	’ said Mr. John Smauker , putting forth his fox ’s head , and elevating his own ; ‘
248734	249031	248728	248728	I	0	’ By this time they had reached a small greengrocer ’s shop , which Mr. John Smauker entered , followed by Sam , who , the moment he got behind him , relapsed into a series of the very broadest and most unmitigated grins , and manifested other demonstrations of being in a highly enviable state of inward merriment . Crossing the greengrocer ’s shop , and putting their hats on the stairs in the little passage behind it , they walked into a small parlour ; and here the full splendour of the scene burst upon Mr. Weller ’s view . A couple of tables were put together in the middle of the parlour , covered with three or four cloths of different ages and dates of washing , arranged to look as much like one as the circumstances of the case would allow . Upon these were laid knives and forks for six or eight people . Some of the knife handles were green , others red , and a few yellow ; and as all the forks were black , the combination of colours was exceedingly striking . Plates for a corresponding number of guests were warming behind the fender ; and the guests themselves were warming before it : the chief and most important of whom appeared to be a stoutish gentleman in a bright crimson coat with long tails , vividly red breeches , and a cocked hat , who was standing with his back to the fire , and had apparently just entered , for besides retaining his cocked hat on his head , he carried in his hand a high stick , such as gentlemen of his profession usually elevate in a sloping position over the roofs of carriages . ‘
249040	249084	249032	249032	Smauker	284	’ said the gentleman with the cocked hat . Mr. Smauker dovetailed the top joint of his right - hand little finger into that of the gentleman with the cocked hat , and said he was charmed to see him looking so well . ‘
249096	249105	249087	249087	they	6620	’ said the man with the cocked hat , ‘
249181	249225	249143	249143	she	6622	’ At this , the assembled selections laughed very heartily ; and one gentleman in a yellow waistcoat , with a coach - trimming border , whispered a neighbour in green - foil smalls , that Tuckle was in spirits to - night . ‘
249230	249235	249236	249236	Smauker	284	’ said Mr. Tuckle , ‘
249242	249260	249241	249241	you--	6625	’ The remainder of the sentence was forwarded into Mr. John Smauker ’s ear , by whisper . ‘
249270	249276	249277	249277	Gentlemen	10163	’ said Mr. John Smauker . ‘
249284	249285	249281	249282	Mr. Weller	356	’ ‘
249296	249306	249294	249294	Weller	356	’ said Mr. Tuckle , with a familiar nod . ‘
249309	249315	249326	249326	Sam	356	’re not cold , Weller . ’
249316	249324	249326	249326	Sam	356	‘ Not by no means , Blazes , ’
249328	249330	249326	249326	Sam	356	‘ It ‘
249367	249415	249350	249350	they	6629	’ As this retort appeared to convey rather a personal allusion to Mr. Tuckle ’s crimson livery , that gentleman looked majestic for a few seconds , but gradually edging away from the fire , broke into a forced smile , and said it was n’t bad . ‘
249426	249430	249424	249424	sir	9716	’ replied Sam . ‘
249453	249592	249593	249593	Harris	653	’ At this point the conversation was interrupted by the arrival of a gentleman in orange - coloured plush , accompanied by another selection in purple cloth , with a great extent of stocking . The new - comers having been welcomed by the old ones , Mr. Tuckle put the question that supper be ordered in , which was carried unanimously . The greengrocer and his wife then arranged upon the table a boiled leg of mutton , hot , with caper sauce , turnips , and potatoes . Mr. Tuckle took the chair , and was supported at the other end of the board by the gentleman in orange plush . The greengrocer put on a pair of wash - leather gloves to hand the plates with , and stationed himself behind Mr. Tuckle ’s chair . ‘
249595	249605	249606	249606	Sir	9716	’ said Mr. Tuckle , in a commanding tone . ‘
249608	249613	249606	249606	Sir	9716	’ said the greengrocer . ‘
249621	249626	249615	249615	you	9716	’ Yes , Sir . ’
249627	249634	249606	249606	Sir	9716	‘ Then take the kiver off . ’
249635	249640	249645	249645	he	14756	‘ Yes , Sir . ’
249674	249684	249686	249687	Mr. Tuckle	651	‘ What do you mean by that , Sir ? ’
249693	249701	249703	249705	the crestfallen greengrocer	6634	‘ I beg your pardon , Sir , ’
249707	249728	249703	249705	the crestfallen greengrocer	6634	‘ I did n’t mean to do it , Sir ; I was up very late last night , Sir . ’
249729	249742	249744	249745	Mr. Tuckle	651	‘ I tell you what my opinion of you is , Harris , ’
249753	249755	249744	249745	Mr. Tuckle	651	‘ you ’re
249760	249761	249744	249745	Mr. Tuckle	651	’ ‘
249767	249771	249762	249762	I	0	’ said Harris , ‘
249823	249824	249819	249819	I	0	’ ‘
249833	249838	249827	249827	you	10163	’ said Mr. Tuckle . ‘

249855	249864	249851	249853	an inattentive reskel	6644	’ said the gentleman in the orange plush . ‘
249870	249881	249866	249868	a low thief	6645	’ added the gentleman in the green - foil smalls . ‘
249887	249982	249866	249868	a low thief	6645	’ added the gentleman in purple . The poor greengrocer bowed very humbly while these little epithets were bestowed upon him , in the true spirit of the very smallest tyranny ; and when everybody had said something to show his superiority , Mr. Tuckle proceeded to carve the leg of mutton , and to help the company . This important business of the evening had hardly commenced , when the door was thrown briskly open , and another gentleman in a light - blue suit , and leaden buttons , made his appearance . ‘
249987	249992	249866	249868	a low thief	6645	’ said Mr. Tuckle . ‘

250131	250143	250145	250145	Tuckle	651	‘ I begin to suspect there ’s something in that quarter , ’
250158	250185	250145	250145	Tuckle	651	‘ I ’ve remarked , once or twice , that she leans very heavy on your shoulder when she gets in and out of the carriage . ’

250206	250274	250201	250204	the man in blue	15445	‘ It ’s not fair . I may have said to one or two friends that she wos a very divine creechure , and had refused one or two offers without any hobvus cause , but -- no , no , no , indeed , Tuckle -- before strangers , too -- it ’s not right-- you should n’t . Delicacy , my dear friend , delicacy ! ’
250393	250399	250401	250401	Sam	356	‘ Your health , Sir , ’
250403	250417	250401	250401	Sam	356	‘ I like your conversation much . I think it ’s wery pretty . ’

250518	250525	250526	250530	That ‘ ere young lady	15460	’ inquired the gentleman in blue . ‘

250830	250838	250840	250843	the gentleman in blue	15443	‘ Of course not , Mr. Weller , ’
250845	250911	250840	250843	the gentleman in blue	15443	‘ one ca n’t be troubled , you know ; and _ we _ know , Mr. Weller -- we , who are men of the world -- that a good uniform must work its way with the women , sooner or later . In fact , that ’s the only thing , between you and me , that makes the service worth entering into . ’
250912	250916	250918	250918	Sam	356	‘ Just so , ’
250920	250926	250918	250918	Sam	356	‘ That ’s it , o ’
250929	250982	250918	250918	Sam	356	’ When this confidential dialogue had gone thus far , glasses were placed round , and every gentleman ordered what he liked best , before the public - house shut up . The gentleman in blue , and the man in orange , who were the chief exquisites of the party , ordered ‘
250988	251014	250840	250843	the gentleman in blue	15443	’ but with the others , gin - and - water , sweet , appeared to be the favourite beverage . Sam called the greengrocer a ‘
251018	251043	251044	251044	Gentlemen	10163	’ and ordered a large bowl of punch -- two circumstances which seemed to raise him very much in the opinion of the selections . ‘
251046	251062	251044	251044	Gentlemen	10163	’ said the man in blue , with an air of the most consummate dandyism , ‘

251078	251082	251083	251085	The young mississes	6673	’ said Sam . ‘
251087	251095	251083	251085	The young mississes	6673	’ Here there was a loud cry of ‘
251098	251133	251044	251044	Gentlemen	10163	’ and Mr. John Smauker , as the gentleman who had introduced Mr. Weller into that company , begged to inform him that the word he had just made use of , was unparliamentary . ‘
251138	251143	251145	251145	Sam	356	‘ ere , Sir ? ’
251147	251152	251154	251156	Mr. John Smauker	284	‘ Mississes , Sir , ’

251183	251192	251181	251181	Sam	356	‘ then I ’ll amend the obserwation and call ‘
251204	251232	251154	251156	Mr. John Smauker	284	’ Some doubt appeared to exist in the mind of the gentleman in the green- foil smalls , whether the chairman could be legally appealed to , as ‘
251235	251397	251154	251156	Mr. John Smauker	284	’ but as the company seemed more disposed to stand upon their own rights than his , the question was not raised . The man with the cocked hat breathed short , and looked long at Sam , but apparently thought it as well to say nothing , in case he should get the worst of it . After a short silence , a gentleman in an embroidered coat reaching down to his heels , and a waistcoat of the same which kept one half of his legs warm , stirred his gin - and - water with great energy , and putting himself upon his feet , all at once by a violent effort , said he was desirous of offering a few remarks to the company , whereupon the person in the cocked hat had no doubt that the company would be very happy to hear any remarks that the man in the long coat might wish to offer . ‘
251410	251419	251154	251156	Mr. John Smauker	284	’ said the man in the long coat , ‘
251512	251539	251507	251508	Mr. Whiffers	656	’ Universal astonishment fell upon the hearers . Each gentleman looked in his neighbour ’s face , and then transferred his glance to the upstanding coachman . ‘
251548	251553	251546	251546	gentlemen	10163	’ said the coachman . ‘
251591	251768	251579	251579	himself	656	’ The suggestion being loudly approved of , Mr. Whiffers explained . He said he certainly could have wished to have continued to hold the appointment he had just resigned . The uniform was extremely rich and expensive , the females of the family was most agreeable , and the duties of the situation was not , he was bound to say , too heavy ; the principal service that was required of him , being , that he should look out of the hall window as much as possible , in company with another gentleman , who had also resigned . He could have wished to have spared that company the painful and disgusting detail on which he was about to enter , but as the explanation had been demanded of him , he had no alternative but to state , boldly and distinctly , that he had been required to eat cold meat . It is impossible to conceive the disgust which this avowal awakened in the bosoms of the hearers . Loud cries of ‘
251771	252106	251579	251579	himself	656	’ mingled with groans and hisses , prevailed for a quarter of an hour . Mr. Whiffers then added that he feared a portion of this outrage might be traced to his own forbearing and accommodating disposition . He had a distinct recollection of having once consented to eat salt butter , and he had , moreover , on an occasion of sudden sickness in the house , so far forgotten himself as to carry a coal - scuttle up to the second floor . He trusted he had not lowered himself in the good opinion of his friends by this frank confession of his faults ; and he hoped the promptness with which he had resented the last unmanly outrage on his feelings , to which he had referred , would reinstate him in their good opinion , if he had . Mr. Whiffers ’s address was responded to , with a shout of admiration , and the health of the interesting martyr was drunk in a most enthusiastic manner ; for this , the martyr returned thanks , and proposed their visitor , Mr. Weller -- a gentleman whom he had not the pleasure of an intimate acquaintance with , but who was the friend of Mr. John Smauker , which was a sufficient letter of recommendation to any society of gentlemen whatever , or wherever . On this account , he should have been disposed to have given Mr. Weller ’s health with all the honours , if his friends had been drinking wine ; but as they were taking spirits by way of a change , and as it might be inconvenient to empty a tumbler at every toast , he should propose that the honours be understood . At the conclusion of this speech , everybody took a sip in honour of Sam ; and Sam having ladled out , and drunk , two full glasses of punch in honour of himself , returned thanks in a neat speech . ‘
252116	252132	252107	252107	Wery	6688	’ said Sam , ladling away at the punch in the most unembarrassed manner possible , ‘

253132	253141	253142	253142	you	356	’ said Mr. Pickwick , grasping his hand , ‘
253143	253159	253167	253168	Mr. Weller	356	’re a capital fellow ; an invaluable fellow . You must follow him , Sam . ’

253241	253267	253238	253239	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ that I am highly excited , highly displeased , and naturally indignant , at the very extraordinary course he has thought proper to pursue . ’
253268	253274	253276	253276	Sam	240	‘ I will , Sir , ’
253278	253284	253286	253287	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ You ’ll tell him , ’
253289	253320	253286	253287	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ that if he does not come back to this very house , with you , he will come back with me , for I will come and fetch him . ’
253321	253326	253329	253329	Sir	9716	‘ I ’ll mention that ‘
253331	253335	253329	253329	Sir	9716	’ rejoined Sam . ‘
253345	253356	253343	253343	Sam	240	’ said Mr. Pickwick , looking earnestly in his face . ‘
253368	253376	253359	253359	I	0	’ rejoined Sam , with great confidence . ‘
253380	253385	253359	253359	I	0	’ said Mr. Pickwick . ‘
253394	253473	253474	253474	Sir	9716	’ With these instructions , Mr. Pickwick placed a sum of money in the hands of his faithful servitor , and ordered him to start for Bristol immediately , in pursuit of the fugitive . Sam put a few necessaries in a carpet - bag , and was ready for starting . He stopped when he had got to the end of the passage , and walking quietly back , thrust his head in at the parlour door . ‘
253476	253480	253474	253474	Sir	9716	’ whispered Sam . ‘
253485	253490	253483	253483	Sam	240	’ said Mr. Pickwick . ‘
253502	253506	253507	253507	I	0	’ inquired Sam . ‘
253511	253516	253507	253507	I	0	’ said Mr. Pickwick . ‘
253524	253532	253534	253534	Sam	240	’ down , is it , Sir ? ’
253536	253539	253541	253541	Pickwick	240	‘ Perfectly , ’
253543	253557	253541	253541	Pickwick	240	‘ Thoroughly . Do what you think necessary . You have my orders . ’
253690	253693	253695	253696	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ If , ’
253772	254131	253736	253737	a wife	1707	’ This painful consideration operated so powerfully on the feelings of the humane young man , as to cause his knees to knock together , and his countenance to exhibit alarming manifestations of inward emotion . Impelled by such reflections , he grasped his carpet - bag , and creeping stealthily downstairs , shut the detestable street door with as little noise as possible , and walked off . Bending his steps towards the Royal Hotel , he found a coach on the point of starting for Bristol , and , thinking Bristol as good a place for his purpose as any other he could go to , he mounted the box , and reached his place of destination in such time as the pair of horses , who went the whole stage and back again , twice a day or more , could be reasonably supposed to arrive there . He took up his quarters at the Bush , and designing to postpone any communication by letter with Mr. Pickwick until it was probable that Mr. Dowler ’s wrath might have in some degree evaporated , walked forth to view the city , which struck him as being a shade more dirty than any place he had ever seen . Having inspected the docks and shipping , and viewed the cathedral , he inquired his way to Clifton , and being directed thither , took the route which was pointed out to him . But as the pavements of Bristol are not the widest or cleanest upon earth , so its streets are not altogether the straightest or least intricate ; and Mr. Winkle , being greatly puzzled by their manifold windings and twistings , looked about him for a decent shop in which he could apply afresh for counsel and instruction . His eye fell upon a newly - painted tenement which had been recently converted into something between a shop and a private house , and which a red lamp , projecting over the fanlight of the street door , would have sufficiently announced as the residence of a medical practitioner , even if the word ‘
254133	254331	254332	254332	I	0	’ had not been inscribed in golden characters on a wainscot ground , above the window of what , in times bygone , had been the front parlour . Thinking this an eligible place wherein to make his inquiries , Mr. Winkle stepped into the little shop where the gilt- labelled drawers and bottles were ; and finding nobody there , knocked with a half - crown on the counter , to attract the attention of anybody who might happen to be in the back parlour , which he judged to be the innermost and peculiar sanctum of the establishment , from the repetition of the word surgery on the door -- painted in white letters this time , by way of taking off the monotony . At the first knock , a sound , as of persons fencing with fire - irons , which had until now been very audible , suddenly ceased ; at the second , a studious - looking young gentleman in green spectacles , with a very large book in his hand , glided quietly into the shop , and stepping behind the counter , requested to know the visitor ’s pleasure . ‘
254341	254346	254332	254332	I	0	’ said Mr. Winkle , ‘
254357	254358	254349	254349	you	6723	’ ‘
254365	254405	254349	254349	you	6723	’ roared the studious young gentleman , throwing the large book up into the air , and catching it with great dexterity at the very moment when it threatened to smash to atoms all the bottles on the counter . ‘
254411	254453	254349	254349	you	6723	’ There was , without doubt ; for Mr. Winkle was so very much astonished at the extraordinary behaviour of the medical gentleman , that he involuntarily retreated towards the door , and looked very much disturbed at his strange reception . ‘
254462	254482	254458	254458	you	0	’ said the medical gentleman . Mr. Winkle murmured , in reply , that he had not that pleasure . ‘
254487	254493	254458	254458	you	0	’ said the medical gentleman , ‘
254528	254593	254594	254594	You	0	’ With this adjuration , which was addressed to the large book , the medical gentleman kicked the volume with remarkable agility to the farther end of the shop , and , pulling off his green spectacles , grinned the identical grin of Robert Sawyer , Esquire , formerly of Guy ’s Hospital in the Borough , with a private residence in Lant Street . ‘
254607	254622	254600	254600	you	0	’ said Mr. Bob Sawyer , shaking Mr. Winkle ’s hand with friendly warmth . ‘
254630	254639	254626	254626	I	0	’ replied Mr. Winkle , returning his pressure . ‘
254649	254677	254678	254678	Sawyer	356	’ said Bob Sawyer , calling his friend ’s attention to the outer door , on which , in the same white paint , were traced the words ‘
254683	254684	254678	254678	Sawyer	356	’ ‘
254691	254696	254697	254697	Lord	6727	’ returned Mr. Winkle . ‘
254720	254725	254707	254707	I	0	’ said Bob Sawyer ; ‘

254848	254896	254809	254812	the Church - rates	6731	’ Chattering in this way , Mr. Bob Sawyer pushed Mr. Winkle into the back room , where , amusing himself by boring little circular caverns in the chimney - piece with a red - hot poker , sat no less a person than Mr. Benjamin Allen . ‘

255101	255106	255076	255077	Bob Sawyer	356	’ said Mr. Winkle . ‘
255111	255143	255076	255077	Bob Sawyer	356	’ returned Bob Sawyer , stepping out into the shop , and demonstrating the veracity of the assertion by divers hard pulls at the little gilt knobs on the counterfeit drawers . ‘
255163	255164	255076	255077	Bob Sawyer	356	’ ‘
255172	255180	255165	255165	I	0	’ exclaimed Mr. Winkle , much surprised . ‘

255236	255260	255216	255216	Ben	657	’ Mr. Benjamin Allen smiled his readiness , and produced from the closet at his elbow a black bottle half full of brandy . ‘
255270	255275	255216	255216	Ben	657	’ said Bob Sawyer . ‘

255319	255340	255341	255341	Ben	657	’ replied Bob Sawyer , tossing off , as he spoke , a glass of the liquor with great relish . ‘
255346	255421	255341	255341	Ben	657	’ Mr. Benjamin Allen drew forth , from the same hiding - place , a small brass pipkin , which Bob Sawyer observed he prided himself upon , particularly because it looked so business - like . The water in the professional pipkin having been made to boil , in course of time , by various little shovelfuls of coal , which Mr. Bob Sawyer took out of a practicable window - seat , labelled ‘
255425	255481	255341	255341	Ben	657	’ Mr. Winkle adulterated his brandy ; and the conversation was becoming general , when it was interrupted by the entrance into the shop of a boy , in a sober gray livery and a gold- laced hat , with a small covered basket under his arm , whom Mr. Bob Sawyer immediately hailed with , ‘
255490	255497	255484	255484	you	370	’ The boy presented himself accordingly . ‘
255517	255523	255513	255515	idle young scamp	6737	’ said Mr. Bob Sawyer . ‘

256410	256419	256421	256421	Ben	657	‘ Nothing , my dear boy , nothing , ’
256423	256481	256421	256421	Ben	657	‘ You recollect Arabella , Winkle ? My sister Arabella -- a little girl , Winkle , with black eyes -- when we were down at Wardle ’s ? I do n’t know whether you happened to notice her -- a nice little girl , Winkle . Perhaps my features may recall her countenance to your recollection ? ’
256554	256565	256523	256523	He	276	‘ Our friend Bob is a delightful fellow , Winkle , ’
256575	256578	256580	256581	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ Very , ’
256594	256597	256580	256581	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ I designed ‘
256625	256638	256623	256623	Winkle	276	’ said Mr. Ben Allen , setting down his glass with emphasis . ‘
256657	256660	256661	256661	em	6770	’ difference between ‘
256671	256740	256742	256742	I	0	’ Mr. Winkle was too anxious to hear what was to follow to express much wonderment at this extraordinary coincidence , marvellous as it was ; so Mr. Ben Allen , after a tear or two , went on to say that , notwithstanding all his esteem and respect and veneration for his friend , Arabella had unaccountably and undutifully evinced the most determined antipathy to his person . ‘
256745	256754	256742	256742	I	0	’ said Mr. Ben Allen , in conclusion . ‘
256763	256764	256742	256742	I	0	’ ‘
256777	256836	256837	256837	I	0	’ asked Mr. Winkle , with great trepidation . Mr. Ben Allen seized the poker , flourished it in a warlike manner above his head , inflicted a savage blow on an imaginary skull , and wound up by saying , in a very expressive manner , that he only wished he could guess ; that was all . ‘
256847	256904	256845	256845	him	6771	’ said Mr. Ben Allen . And round went the poker again , more fiercely than before . All this was , of course , very soothing to the feelings of Mr. Winkle , who remained silent for a few minutes ; but at length mustered up resolution to inquire whether Miss Allen was in Kent . ‘
256909	256925	256845	256845	him	6771	’ said Mr. Ben Allen , laying aside the poker , and looking very cunning ; ‘
257019	257020	257075	257075	Bob	356	’ ‘
257033	257038	257023	257024	the aunt	10237	’ faltered Mr. Winkle . ‘
257047	257061	257023	257024	the aunt	10237	’ replied Mr. Ben Allen , jerking his thumb over his right shoulder ; ‘
257089	257174	257075	257075	Bob	356	’ Short as this conversation was , it roused in Mr. Winkle the highest degree of excitement and anxiety . The suspected prior attachment rankled in his heart . Could he be the object of it ? Could it be for him that the fair Arabella had looked scornfully on the sprightly Bob Sawyer , or had he a successful rival ? He determined to see her , cost what it might ; but here an insurmountable objection presented itself , for whether the explanatory ‘
257179	257181	257075	257075	Bob	356	’ and ‘
257185	257330	257075	257075	Bob	356	’ of Mr. Ben Allen , meant three miles off , or thirty , or three hundred , he could in no wise guess . But he had no opportunity of pondering over his love just then , for Bob Sawyer ’s return was the immediate precursor of the arrival of a meat - pie from the baker ’s , of which that gentleman insisted on his staying to partake . The cloth was laid by an occasional charwoman , who officiated in the capacity of Mr. Bob Sawyer ’s housekeeper ; and a third knife and fork having been borrowed from the mother of the boy in the gray livery ( for Mr. Sawyer ’s domestic arrangements were as yet conducted on a limited scale ) , they sat down to dinner ; the beer being served up , as Mr. Sawyer remarked , ‘
257336	258000	258001	258002	Mr. Winkle	276	’ After dinner , Mr. Bob Sawyer ordered in the largest mortar in the shop , and proceeded to brew a reeking jorum of rum - punch therein , stirring up and amalgamating the materials with a pestle in a very creditable and apothecary - like manner . Mr. Sawyer , being a bachelor , had only one tumbler in the house , which was assigned to Mr. Winkle as a compliment to the visitor , Mr. Ben Allen being accommodated with a funnel with a cork in the narrow end , and Bob Sawyer contented himself with one of those wide - lipped crystal vessels inscribed with a variety of cabalistic characters , in which chemists are wo nt to measure out their liquid drugs in compounding prescriptions . These preliminaries adjusted , the punch was tasted , and pronounced excellent ; and it having been arranged that Bob Sawyer and Ben Allen should be considered at liberty to fill twice to Mr. Winkle ’s once , they started fair , with great satisfaction and good - fellowship . There was no singing , because Mr. Bob Sawyer said it would n’t look professional ; but to make amends for this deprivation there was so much talking and laughing that it might have been heard , and very likely was , at the end of the street . Which conversation materially lightened the hours and improved the mind of Mr. Bob Sawyer ’s boy , who , instead of devoting the evening to his ordinary occupation of writing his name on the counter , and rubbing it out again , peeped through the glass door , and thus listened and looked on at the same time . The mirth of Mr. Bob Sawyer was rapidly ripening into the furious , Mr. Ben Allen was fast relapsing into the sentimental , and the punch had well - nigh disappeared altogether , when the boy hastily running in , announced that a young woman had just come over , to say that Sawyer late Nockemorf was wanted directly , a couple of streets off . This broke up the party . Mr. Bob Sawyer , understanding the message , after some twenty repetitions , tied a wet cloth round his head to sober himself , and , having partially succeeded , put on his green spectacles and issued forth . Resisting all entreaties to stay till he came back , and finding it quite impossible to engage Mr. Ben Allen in any intelligible conversation on the subject nearest his heart , or indeed on any other , Mr. Winkle took his departure , and returned to the Bush . The anxiety of his mind , and the numerous meditations which Arabella had awakened , prevented his share of the mortar of punch producing that effect upon him which it would have had under other circumstances . So , after taking a glass of soda - water and brandy at the bar , he turned into the coffee - room , dispirited rather than elevated by the occurrences of the evening . Sitting in front of the fire , with his back towards him , was a tallish gentleman in a greatcoat : the only other occupant of the room . It was rather a cool evening for the season of the year , and the gentleman drew his chair aside to afford the new - comer a sight of the fire . What were Mr. Winkle ’s feelings when , in doing so , he disclosed to view the face and figure of the vindictive and sanguinary Dowler ! Mr. Winkle ’s first impulse was to give a violent pull at the nearest bell - handle , but that unfortunately happened to be immediately behind Mr. Dowler ’s head . He had made one step towards it , before he checked himself . As he did so , Mr. Dowler very hastily drew back . ‘
258025	258044	258048	258048	Sir	9716	’ said Mr. Dowler , looking meeker than Mr. Winkle had expected in a gentleman of his ferocity . ‘
258050	258055	258048	258048	Sir	9716	’ stammered Mr. Winkle . ‘
258061	258065	258059	258059	Sir	9716	’ replied Dowler . ‘
258076	258077	258078	258078	Sir	9716	’ ‘
258080	258091	258078	258078	Sir	9716	’ said Mr. Winkle , trembling from head to foot , ‘
258137	258150	258151	258151	I	0	’ Here Mr. Winkle turned very pale indeed , and stopped short . ‘
258154	258169	258151	258151	I	0	’ said Dowler , with a countenance almost as white as Mr. Winkle ’s . ‘
258200	258201	258194	258194	my	0	’ ‘
258206	258238	258241	258241	Sir	9716	’ said Mr. Winkle , hesitating whether to give his hand or not , and almost fearing that it was demanded in order that he might be taken at an advantage , ‘
258244	258245	258243	258243	I--	0	’ ‘
258252	258256	258246	258246	I	0	’ interposed Dowler . ‘
258282	258323	258280	258280	me	0	’ With this , Dowler fairly forced his hand upon Mr. Winkle , and shaking it with the utmost vehemence , declared he was a fellow of extreme spirit , and he had a higher opinion of him than ever . ‘
258326	258330	258273	258273	your	9716	’ said Dowler , ‘
258355	258356	258353	258353	me	0	’ ‘
258362	258379	258353	258353	me	0	’ replied Mr. Winkle , greatly perplexed by the curious and unexpected nature of the interview . ‘
258382	258383	258353	258353	me	0	’ ‘
258388	258392	258353	258353	me	0	’ said Dowler . ‘
258418	258419	258414	258414	I	0	’ ‘
258423	258428	258414	258414	I	0	’ inquired Mr. Winkle . ‘
258478	258479	258475	258475	he	6794	’ ‘
258482	258487	258488	258488	You	627	’ inquired Mr. Winkle . ‘
258490	258494	258488	258488	You	627	’ replied Dowler . ‘
258557	258577	258578	258578	I	0	’ Mr. Winkle coughed , and beginning to see how the land lay , assumed a look of importance . ‘
258585	258589	258590	258590	I	0	’ resumed Dowler . ‘
258645	258902	258620	258620	You	627	’ As Dowler progressed in his explanation , Mr. Winkle ’s countenance grew more and more dignified . The mysterious nature of the commencement of their conversation was explained ; Mr. Dowler had as great an objection to duelling as himself ; in short , this blustering and awful personage was one of the most egregious cowards in existence , and interpreting Mr. Winkle ’s absence through the medium of his own fears , had taken the same step as himself , and prudently retired until all excitement of feeling should have subsided . As the real state of the case dawned upon Mr. Winkle ’s mind , he looked very terrible , and said he was perfectly satisfied ; but at the same time , said so with an air that left Mr. Dowler no alternative but to infer that if he had not been , something most horrible and destructive must inevitably have occurred . Mr. Dowler appeared to be impressed with a becoming sense of Mr. Winkle ’s magnanimity and condescension ; and the two belligerents parted for the night , with many protestations of eternal friendship . About half - past twelve o’clock , when Mr. Winkle had been revelling some twenty minutes in the full luxury of his first sleep , he was suddenly awakened by a loud knocking at his chamber door , which , being repeated with increased vehemence , caused him to start up in bed , and inquire who was there , and what the matter was . ‘
258920	258928	258929	258931	A young man	1698	’ responded the voice of the chambermaid . ‘
258933	258938	258929	258931	A young man	1698	’ exclaimed Mr. Winkle . ‘
258943	258948	258914	258914	he	6798	‘ ere , Sir , ’
258956	258963	258914	258914	he	6798	‘ and if that wery same interestin ’
258986	259024	258983	258983	his	6798	’ The young man gave a gentle kick at one of the lower panels of the door , after he had given utterance to this hint , as if to add force and point to the remark . ‘
259031	259041	259027	259027	you	9716	’ inquired Mr. Winkle , springing out of bed . ‘
259052	259058	258983	258983	his	6798	’ mental satisfaction , vithout lookin ’
259064	259130	259062	259062	Sir	9716	’ replied the voice dogmatically . Mr. Winkle , not much doubting who the young man was , unlocked the door ; which he had no sooner done than Mr. Samuel Weller entered with great precipitation , and carefully relocking it on the inside , deliberately put the key in his waistcoat pocket ; and , after surveying Mr. Winkle from head to foot , said-- ‘
259132	259144	259158	259159	Mr. Winkle	276	’re a wery humorous young gen’l’m’n , you air , Sir ! ’
259145	259156	259158	259159	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ What do you mean by this conduct , Sam ? ’
259162	259178	259158	259159	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ Get out , sir , this instant . What do you mean , Sir ? ’
259179	259185	259187	259187	Sam	356	‘ What do I mean , ’
259189	259242	259187	259187	Sam	356	‘ come , Sir , this is rayther too rich , as the young lady said when she remonstrated with the pastry - cook , arter he ’d sold her a pork pie as had got nothin’ but fat inside . What do I mean ! Well , that ai n’t a bad ‘
259249	259250	259158	259159	Mr. Winkle	276	’ ‘
259263	259268	259261	259261	Sir	9716	’ said Mr. Winkle . ‘
259290	259307	259276	259276	sir	9716	’ responded Sam , speaking in a forcible manner , and seating himself with perfect gravity . ‘
259325	259335	259349	259349	you	9716	’ course I shall leave it the least bit o ’
259407	259459	259388	259388	he	6808	’ At the end of this address , which was unusually lengthy for him , Mr. Weller planted his hands on his knees , and looked full in Mr. Winkle ’s face , with an expression of countenance which showed that he had not the remotest intention of being trifled with . ‘
259461	259476	259478	259479	Mr. Weller	356	’re a amiably - disposed young man , Sir , I do n’t think , ’
259488	259499	259478	259479	Mr. Weller	356	‘ to go inwolving our precious governor in all sorts o ’
259517	259539	259540	259541	Mr. Weller	356	’re far worse nor Dodson , Sir ; and as for Fogg , I consider him a born angel to you ! ’
259581	259586	259588	259589	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ My good fellow , ’
259657	259658	259653	259653	Sam	356	’ ‘
259661	259722	259653	259653	Sam	356	’ said Sam , rather sulkily , but giving the proffered hand a respectful shake at the same time--‘well , so you ought to be , and I am very glad to find you air ; for , if I can help it , I wo n’t have him put upon by nobody , and that ’s all about it . ’
259723	259729	259731	259732	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ Certainly not , Sam , ’
259734	259755	259731	259732	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ There ! Now go to bed , Sam , and we ’ll talk further about this in the morning . ’
259756	259758	259759	259759	wery	6812	‘ I ’m
259762	259766	259759	259759	wery	6812	’ said Sam , ‘

259782	259787	259731	259732	Mr. Winkle	276	’ repeated Mr. Winkle . ‘
259790	259798	259731	259732	Mr. Winkle	276	’ said Sam , shaking his head . ‘
259804	259805	259806	259806	You	0	’ ‘
259813	259822	259824	259825	Mr. Winkle	276	’re going back to - night , Sam ? ’
259830	259838	259840	259840	Sam	356	‘ Not unless you particklerly wish it , ’
259842	259859	259840	259840	Sam	356	‘ but I must n’t leave this here room . The governor ’s orders wos peremptory . ’
259860	259865	259867	259868	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ Nonsense , Sam , ’
259870	259925	259867	259868	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ I must stop here two or three days ; and more than that , Sam , you must stop here too , to assist me in gaining an interview with a young lady -- Miss Allen , Sam ; you remember her -- whom I must and will see before I leave Bristol . ’
259947	259954	259935	259935	Sam	356	‘ It ca n’t be done . ’
260210	260217	260199	260199	he	240	‘ I quite forgot about the knockin ’
260220	260228	260229	260230	The governor	12831	’ said Sam , half turning back . ‘
260240	260243	260199	260199	he	240	’ stupid o ’
260247	260253	260255	260255	Sam	240	‘ ere ! Never mind , ’
260260	260270	260255	260255	Sam	240	‘ it ’s easily done to- morrow , anyvays . ’
260561	260570	260572	260573	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I thought it better to come myself , ’
260593	260626	260580	260580	Sam	240	‘ to ascertain , before I gave my consent to Sam ’s employment in this matter , that you are quite in earnest and serious , with respect to this young lady . ’
260627	260638	260640	260641	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ Serious , from my heart -- from my soul ! ’
260647	260650	260652	260653	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Remember , ’
260659	260709	260652	260653	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ we met her at our excellent and hospitable friend ’s , Winkle . It would be an ill return to tamper lightly , and without due consideration , with this young lady ’s affections . I ’ll not allow that , sir . I ’ll not allow it . ’
260710	260719	260721	260722	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ I have no such intention , indeed , ’
260725	260750	260721	260722	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ I have considered the matter well , for a long time , and I feel that my happiness is bound up in her . ’
260751	260767	260769	260770	Mr. Weller	356	‘ That ’s wot we call tying it up in a small parcel , sir , ’

261473	261485	261471	261471	Sam	356	‘ I _ do _ mean arternoon . How are you ? ’
261486	261502	261504	261508	the ill - tempered groom	6863	‘ Why , I do n’t find myself much the better for seeing of you , ’
261510	261519	261521	261521	Sam	356	‘ That ’s wery odd -- that is , ’
261523	261548	261521	261521	Sam	356	‘ for you look so uncommon cheerful , and seem altogether so lively , that it does vun ’s heart good to see you . ’
261589	261596	261598	261599	the groom	15692	‘ No , it ai n’t , ’

261679	261698	261634	261635	the groom	15692	’ said Sam , as the groom wheeled in the barrow , and prepared to shut the gate . ‘
261711	261712	261709	261709	you	11657	’ ‘
261726	261739	261713	261713	I	0	’ said the surly groom , bolting one half of the gate . ‘
261751	261755	261713	261713	I	0	’ rejoined Sam . ‘
261757	261773	261713	261713	I	0	‘ ud be worth a life ’s board wages at least , to you , and ‘

261816	262198	262199	262199	My	0	’ In reply to this , the groom waxing very wroth , muttered a desire to damage somebody ’s person ; but disappeared without carrying it into execution , slamming the door angrily after him , and wholly unheeding Sam ’s affectionate request , that he would leave him a lock of his hair before he went . Sam continued to sit on the large stone , meditating upon what was best to be done , and revolving in his mind a plan for knocking at all the doors within five miles of Bristol , taking them at a hundred and fifty or two hundred a day , and endeavouring to find Miss Arabella by that expedient , when accident all of a sudden threw in his way what he might have sat there for a twelvemonth and yet not found without it . Into the lane where he sat , there opened three or four garden gates , belonging to as many houses , which though detached from each other , were only separated by their gardens . As these were large and long , and well planted with trees , the houses were not only at some distance off , but the greater part of them were nearly concealed from view . Sam was sitting with his eyes fixed upon the dust - heap outside the next gate to that by which the groom had disappeared , profoundly turning over in his mind the difficulties of his present undertaking , when the gate opened , and a female servant came out into the lane to shake some bedside carpets . Sam was so very busy with his own thoughts , that it is probable he would have taken no more notice of the young woman than just raising his head and remarking that she had a very neat and pretty figure , if his feelings of gallantry had not been most strongly roused by observing that she had no one to help her , and that the carpets seemed too heavy for her single strength . Mr. Weller was a gentleman of great gallantry in his own way , and he no sooner remarked this circumstance than he hastily rose from the large stone , and advanced towards her . ‘
262202	262215	262216	262216	you	10214	’ said Sam , sliding up with an air of great respect , ‘
262225	262241	262242	262244	The young lady	2945	’ all perportion if you shake them carpets by yourself . Let me help you . ’
262338	262346	262348	262348	Sam	356	‘ Wy , Mary , my dear ! ’
262350	262356	262358	262358	Mary	307	‘ Lauk , Mr. Weller , ’
262360	262367	262358	262358	Mary	307	‘ how you do frighten one ! ’
262399	262408	262396	262396	Mary	307	‘ Lor , do adun , Mr. Weller ! ’
262445	262454	262456	262456	Mary	307	‘ Why , how did you come here ? ’

262505	262515	262517	262517	Mary	307	‘ And how did you know I was here ? ’
262519	262555	262517	262517	Mary	307	‘ Who could have told you that I took another service at Ipswich , and that they afterwards moved all the way here ? Who _ could _ have told you that , Mr. Weller ? ’
262556	262563	262565	262565	Sam	356	‘ Ah , to be sure , ’

262605	262617	262517	262517	Mary	307	’ replied Sam , with a solemn shake of the head , ‘
262622	262623	262517	262517	Mary	307	’ ‘
262631	262635	262628	262629	the cook	3453	’ said Mary . ‘

262646	262657	262659	262659	Mary	307	‘ Well , I never heard the like of that ! ’

262671	262698	262669	262669	Sam	356	‘ But Mary , my dear’--here Sam ’s manner grew extremely affectionate--‘Mary , my dear , I ’ve got another affair in hand as is wery pressin ’

262718	262725	262727	262727	Mary	307	‘ Him in the green coat ? ’
262729	262738	262727	262727	Mary	307	‘ Oh , yes , I remember him . ’
262739	262742	262744	262744	Sam	356	‘ Well , ’

262770	262774	262727	262727	Mary	307	’ interposed Mary . ‘
262777	262781	262727	262727	Mary	307	’ said Sam ; ‘
262793	262796	262799	262799	Sam	356	‘ ooman ; ’
262835	262838	262840	262840	Mary	307	‘ Well , ’

262854	262858	262840	262840	Mary	307	’ said Sam , ‘
262876	262885	262872	262872	I	0	’ about like the wandering Jew -- a sportin ’
262904	262921	262872	262872	I	0	’ time , and never vent to sleep -- looking arter this here Miss Arabella Allen . ’
262922	262926	262928	262928	Mary	307	‘ Miss who ? ’
262934	262939	262941	262941	Sam	356	‘ Miss Arabella Allen , ’
262943	262947	262949	262949	Mary	307	‘ Goodness gracious ! ’
262965	263017	262949	262949	Mary	307	‘ Why , it ’s that very house ; she ’s been living there these six weeks . Their upper house - maid , which is lady’s- maid too , told me all about it over the wash - house palin ’s before the family was out of bed , one mornin ’
263019	263020	262949	262949	Mary	307	’ ‘
263030	263034	262949	262949	Mary	307	’ said Sam . ‘
263039	263089	263090	263090	Vell	497	’ replied Mary . Mr. Weller was so deeply overcome on receiving this intelligence that he found it absolutely necessary to cling to his fair informant for support ; and divers little love passages had passed between them , before he was sufficiently collected to return to the subject . ‘
263092	263098	263090	263090	Vell	497	’ said Sam at length , ‘
263107	263123	263090	263090	Vell	497	’ nothin’ never vill , as the lord mayor said , ven the chief secretary o ’
263159	263160	263140	263140	I	0	’ ‘
263163	263167	263140	263140	I	0	’ said Mary , ‘
263206	263770	263771	263771	She	6893	’ Sam ruminated for a few moments , and finally hit upon the following plan of operations ; that he should return just at dusk -- the time at which Arabella invariably took her walk -- and , being admitted by Mary into the garden of the house to which she belonged , would contrive to scramble up the wall , beneath the overhanging boughs of a large pear - tree , which would effectually screen him from observation ; would there deliver his message , and arrange , if possible , an interview on behalf of Mr. Winkle for the ensuing evening at the same hour . Having made this arrangement with great despatch , he assisted Mary in the long - deferred occupation of shaking the carpets . It is not half as innocent a thing as it looks , that shaking little pieces of carpet -- at least , there may be no great harm in the shaking , but the folding is a very insidious process . So long as the shaking lasts , and the two parties are kept the carpet ’s length apart , it is as innocent an amusement as can well be devised ; but when the folding begins , and the distance between them gets gradually lessened from one half its former length to a quarter , and then to an eighth , and then to a sixteenth , and then to a thirty - second , if the carpet be long enough , it becomes dangerous . We do not know , to a nicety , how many pieces of carpet were folded in this instance , but we can venture to state that as many pieces as there were , so many times did Sam kiss the pretty housemaid . Mr. Weller regaled himself with moderation at the nearest tavern until it was nearly dusk , and then returned to the lane without the thoroughfare . Having been admitted into the garden by Mary , and having received from that lady sundry admonitions concerning the safety of his limbs and neck , Sam mounted into the pear - tree , to wait until Arabella should come into sight . He waited so long without this anxiously - expected event occurring , that he began to think it was not going to take place at all , when he heard light footsteps upon the gravel , and immediately afterwards beheld Arabella walking pensively down the garden . As soon as she came nearly below the tree , Sam began , by way of gently indicating his presence , to make sundry diabolical noises similar to those which would probably be natural to a person of middle age who had been afflicted with a combination of inflammatory sore throat , croup , and whooping - cough , from his earliest infancy . Upon this , the young lady cast a hurried glance towards the spot whence the dreadful sounds proceeded ; and her previous alarm being not at all diminished when she saw a man among the branches , she would most certainly have decamped , and alarmed the house , had not fear fortunately deprived her of the power of moving , and caused her to sink down on a garden seat , which happened by good luck to be near at hand . ‘
263778	263785	263771	263771	She	6893	’ soliloquised Sam in great perplexity . ‘
263802	263814	263817	263818	Miss Sawbones	661	’ avay just ven they ought n’t to . Here , young ‘
263826	263870	263820	263821	Mrs. Vinkle	662	’ Whether it was the magic of Mr. Winkle ’s name , or the coolness of the open air , or some recollection of Mr. Weller ’s voice , that revived Arabella , matters not . She raised her head and languidly inquired , ‘
263881	263882	263878	263878	you	6895	’ ‘
263885	263911	263913	263913	me	0	’ said Sam , swinging himself on to the wall , and crouching there in as small a compass as he could reduce himself to , ‘
263920	263921	263918	263918	me	0	’ ‘
263927	263932	263922	263923	Mr. Pickwick	240	’ said Arabella earnestly . ‘
263939	263943	263937	263937	miss	5840	’ replied Sam . ‘
263956	263957	263946	263947	Mr. Vinkle	663	’ ‘
263960	263969	263946	263947	Mr. Vinkle	663	’ said Arabella , drawing nearer the wall . ‘
263974	263978	263979	263979	Ve	6895	’ said Sam . ‘
263984	264001	264006	264006	he	663	’ been obliged to strait - veskit him last night ; he ’s been a - ravin ’

264047	264055	264044	264045	Mr. Weller	356	’ said Arabella , clasping her hands . ‘
264064	264069	264059	264059	he	663	’ replied Sam coolly . ‘
264102	264103	264090	264090	He	663	’ ‘
264108	264121	264122	264122	I	0	’ said Arabella , having some faint recognition of Sam ’s description . ‘
264134	264138	264132	264132	miss	5840	’ replied Sam . ‘
264145	264149	264132	264132	miss	5840	’ the two ? ’
264150	264158	264160	264160	Arabella	297	‘ Yes , yes , Mr. Weller , ’
264162	264171	264160	264160	Arabella	297	‘ go on . Make haste , pray . ’
264172	264177	264179	264179	Sam	356	‘ Well , miss , ’
264181	264217	264179	264179	Sam	356	‘ he ’s heerd all about it from him ; and it ’s the gov’nor ’s opinion that if you do n’t see him wery quick , the sawbones as we ’ve been a - speakin ’
264220	264236	264160	264160	Arabella	297	‘ ull get as much extra lead in his head as’ll rayther damage the dewelopment o ’
264248	264249	264240	264240	they	6907	’ ‘
264262	264266	264240	264240	they	6907	’ exclaimed Arabella . ‘
264274	264284	264286	264286	Sam	356	‘ tachment as is the cause of it all , ’
264288	264297	264286	264286	Sam	356	‘ You ’d better see him , miss . ’
264298	264302	264304	264304	Arabella	297	‘ But how?--where ? ’
264306	264346	264304	264304	Arabella	297	‘ I dare not leave the house alone . My brother is so unkind , so unreasonable ! I know how strange my talking thus to you may appear , Mr. Weller , but I am very , very unhappy-- ’
264359	264366	264355	264355	Sam	356	‘ It may seem wery strange talkin ’
264376	264384	264355	264355	Sam	356	’ said Sam , with great vehemence ; ‘
264394	264400	264355	264355	Sam	356	’m not only ready but villin ’
264404	264413	264355	264355	Sam	356	’ as’ll make matters agreeable ; and if chuckin ’
264416	264421	264355	264355	Sam	356	’ them sawboneses out o ’

264433	264657	264430	264431	the man	835	’ As Sam Weller said this , he tucked up his wristbands , at the imminent hazard of falling off the wall in so doing , to intimate his readiness to set to work immediately . Flattering as these professions of good feeling were , Arabella resolutely declined ( most unaccountably , as Sam thought ) to avail herself of them . For some time she strenuously refused to grant Mr. Winkle the interview Sam had so pathetically requested ; but at length , when the conversation threatened to be interrupted by the unwelcome arrival of a third party , she hurriedly gave him to understand , with many professions of gratitude , that it was barely possible she might be in the garden an hour later , next evening . Sam understood this perfectly well ; and Arabella , bestowing upon him one of her sweetest smiles , tripped gracefully away , leaving Mr. Weller in a state of very great admiration of her charms , both personal and mental . Having descended in safety from the wall , and not forgotten to devote a few moments to his own particular business in the same department , Mr. Weller then made the best of his way back to the Bush , where his prolonged absence had occasioned much speculation and some alarm . ‘
264663	264676	264658	264658	We	6911	’ said Mr. Pickwick , after listening attentively to Sam ’s tale , ‘
264696	264697	264699	264699	We	6911	’ ‘
264702	264736	264738	264738	We	6911	’ said Mr. Winkle , with marked emphasis . Mr. Pickwick ’s momentary look of indignation at the tone of this remark , subsided into his characteristic expression of benevolence , as he replied-- ‘
264748	264749	264750	264750	You	9716	’ ‘
264752	264757	264758	264758	I	0	’ said Mr. Winkle . ‘
264760	264766	264758	264758	I	0	’ replied Mr. Pickwick mildly . ‘
264826	264881	264882	264882	You	9716	’ Mr. Pickwick ’s eyes lightened with honest exultation at his own foresight , as he spoke thus . Mr. Winkle was touched by this little trait of his delicate respect for the young _ protegee _ of his friend , and took his hand with a feeling of regard , akin to veneration . ‘
264888	264893	264882	264882	You	9716	’ said Mr. Winkle . ‘
264897	264902	264903	264903	Sam	240	’ said Mr. Pickwick . ‘
264943	265117	265118	265118	I	0	’ Mr. Weller touched his hat , as an earnest of his obedience , and withdrew to make all needful preparations for the expedition . The coach was punctual to the time appointed ; and Mr. Weller , after duly installing Mr. Pickwick and Mr. Winkle inside , took his seat on the box by the driver . They alighted , as had been agreed on , about a quarter of a mile from the place of rendezvous , and desiring the coachman to await their return , proceeded the remaining distance on foot . It was at this stage of the undertaking that Mr. Pickwick , with many smiles and various other indications of great self - satisfaction , produced from one of his coat pockets a dark lantern , with which he had specially provided himself for the occasion , and the great mechanical beauty of which he proceeded to explain to Mr. Winkle , as they walked along , to the no small surprise of the few stragglers they met . ‘
265143	265161	265141	265141	Sam	240	’ said Mr. Pickwick , looking good- humouredly round at his follower , who was trudging behind . ‘
265168	265174	265176	265177	Mr. Weller	356	’re managed properly , Sir , ’
265179	265193	265176	265177	Mr. Weller	356	‘ but wen you do n’t want to be seen , I think they ’re
265209	265236	265176	265177	Mr. Weller	356	’ Mr. Pickwick appeared struck by Sam ’s remarks , for he put the lantern into his pocket again , and they walked on in silence . ‘
265242	265246	265240	265240	Sir	9716	’ said Sam . ‘
265260	265411	265258	265258	Sir	9716	’ Down the lane they went , and dark enough it was . Mr. Pickwick brought out the lantern , once or twice , as they groped their way along , and threw a very brilliant little tunnel of light before them , about a foot in diameter . It was very pretty to look at , but seemed to have the effect of rendering surrounding objects rather darker than before . At length they arrived at the large stone . Here Sam recommended his master and Mr. Winkle to seat themselves , while he reconnoitred , and ascertained whether Mary was yet in waiting . After an absence of five or ten minutes , Sam returned to say that the gate was opened , and all quiet . Following him with stealthy tread , Mr. Pickwick and Mr. Winkle soon found themselves in the garden . Here everybody said , ‘
265414	265442	265258	265258	Sir	9716	’ a good many times ; and that being done , no one seemed to have any very distinct apprehension of what was to be done next . ‘
265453	265461	265444	265445	Miss Allen	297	’ inquired Mr. Winkle , much agitated . ‘
265469	265475	265462	265462	I	0	’ replied the pretty housemaid . ‘
265535	265536	265622	265622	sir	9716	’ ‘

265551	265556	265622	265622	sir	9716	’ exclaimed Sam peevishly . ‘

265624	265628	265622	265622	sir	9716	’ remonstrated Sam . ‘
265633	265642	265622	265622	sir	9716	’ exclaimed Mr. Pickwick , turning round again . ‘
265660	265664	265652	265652	they	6933	’ said Sam . ‘
265675	265676	265673	265673	you	9716	’ ‘

265781	265786	265788	265789	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Stop , stop ! ’

266034	266072	266032	266032	Arabella	297	‘ Tell them all to go away . I am so dreadfully frightened . Dear , dear Mr. Pickwick , do n’t stop there . You ’ll fall down and kill yourself , I know you will . ’
266073	266085	266087	266088	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Now , pray do n’t alarm yourself , my dear , ’
266091	266110	266112	266113	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ There is not the least cause for fear , I assure you . Stand firm , Sam , ’
266118	266124	266126	266127	Mr. Weller	356	‘ All right , sir , ’
266129	266143	266126	266127	Mr. Weller	356	‘ Do n’t be longer than you can conweniently help , sir . You ’re
266147	266148	266126	266127	Mr. Weller	356	’ ‘
266155	266160	266153	266153	Sam	356	’ replied Mr. Pickwick . ‘
266241	266242	266245	266246	Mr. Pickwick	240	’ ‘
266261	266377	266248	266248	I	0	’ replied Arabella , drying her tears with her handkerchief . She would probably have said much more , had not Mr. Pickwick ’s head disappeared with great swiftness , in consequence of a false step on Sam ’s shoulder which brought him suddenly to the ground . He was up again in an instant however ; and bidding Mr. Winkle make haste and get the interview over , ran out into the lane to keep watch , with all the courage and ardour of youth . Mr. Winkle himself , inspired by the occasion , was on the wall in a moment , merely pausing to request Sam to be careful of his master . ‘
266387	266391	266385	266385	sir	9716	’ replied Sam . ‘
266397	266398	266395	266395	me	0	’ ‘
266410	266415	266405	266405	he	6946	’ inquired Mr. Winkle . ‘
266421	266432	266417	266419	his old gaiters	6948	’ rejoined Sam , looking out at the garden door . ‘
266438	266445	266417	266419	his old gaiters	6948	’ guard in the lane vith that ‘
266477	266493	266473	266473	his	6946	’ been born five - and - twenty year arter his body , at least ! ’
266996	266999	267001	267003	the scientific gentleman	6954	‘ Pruffle , ’
267005	267023	267025	267027	the scientific gentleman	6954	‘ there is something very extraordinary in the air to - night ? Did you see that ? ’
267042	267050	267025	267027	the scientific gentleman	6954	‘ Yes , I did , Sir . ’
267051	267061	267025	267027	the scientific gentleman	6954	‘ What do you think of it , Pruffle ? ’
267062	267069	267025	267027	the scientific gentleman	6954	‘ Think of it , Sir ? ’
267070	267095	267096	267098	The scientific gentleman	6954	‘ Yes . You have been bred up in this country . What should you say was the cause for those lights , now ? ’
267118	267128	267130	267130	Pruffle	664	‘ I should say it was thieves , Sir , ’
267134	267136	267130	267130	Pruffle	664	‘ You ’re
267145	267151	267096	267098	The scientific gentleman	6954	’ said the scientific gentleman . ‘
267157	267343	267155	267155	Sir	9716	’ said Pruffle . And down he went . But the scientific gentleman could not rest under the idea of the ingenious treatise he had projected being lost to the world , which must inevitably be the case if the speculation of the ingenious Mr. Pruffle were not stifled in its birth . He put on his hat and walked quickly down the garden , determined to investigate the matter to the very bottom . Now , shortly before the scientific gentleman walked out into the garden , Mr. Pickwick had run down the lane as fast as he could , to convey a false alarm that somebody was coming that way ; occasionally drawing back the slide of the dark lantern to keep himself from the ditch . The alarm was no sooner given , than Mr. Winkle scrambled back over the wall , and Arabella ran into the house ; the garden gate was shut , and the three adventurers were making the best of their way down the lane , when they were startled by the scientific gentleman unlocking his garden gate . ‘
267347	267363	267155	267155	Sir	9716	’ whispered Sam , who was , of course , the first of the party . ‘
267374	267468	267372	267372	Sir	9716	’ Mr. Pickwick did as he was desired , and Sam , seeing a man ’s head peeping out very cautiously within half a yard of his own , gave it a gentle tap with his clenched fist , which knocked it , with a hollow sound , against the gate . Having performed this feat with great suddenness and dexterity , Mr. Weller caught Mr. Pickwick up on his back , and followed Mr. Winkle down the lane at a pace which , considering the burden he carried , was perfectly astonishing . ‘
267479	267490	267477	267477	Sir	9716	’ inquired Sam , when they had reached the end . ‘
267497	267502	267372	267372	Sir	9716	’ replied Mr. Pickwick . ‘
267509	267521	267507	267507	Sir	9716	’ said Sam , setting his master on his feet again . ‘
267537	267539	267507	267507	Sir	9716	’re vinnin ’
267549	267632	267639	267639	sir	9716	’ Thus encouraged , Mr. Pickwick made the very best use of his legs . It may be confidently stated that a pair of black gaiters never got over the ground in better style than did those of Mr. Pickwick on this memorable occasion . The coach was waiting , the horses were fresh , the roads were good , and the driver was willing . The whole party arrived in safety at the Bush before Mr. Pickwick had recovered his breath . ‘
267641	267652	267639	267639	sir	9716	’ said Sam , as he helped his master out . ‘
267664	267674	267676	267676	Sam	240	‘ ere exercise . Beg your pardon , sir , ’
267686	267692	267695	267695	sir	9716	‘ hope there warn’t a priory ‘
267697	267714	267695	267695	sir	9716	’ Mr. Winkle grasped his humble friend by the hand , and whispered in his ear , ‘
267725	268388	267720	267720	Sam	240	’ Upon which Mr. Weller struck three distinct blows upon his nose in token of intelligence , smiled , winked , and proceeded to put the steps up , with a countenance expressive of lively satisfaction . As to the scientific gentleman , he demonstrated , in a masterly treatise , that these wonderful lights were the effect of electricity ; and clearly proved the same by detailing how a flash of fire danced before his eyes when he put his head out of the gate , and how he received a shock which stunned him for a quarter of an hour afterwards ; which demonstration delighted all the scientific associations beyond measure , and caused him to be considered a light of science ever afterwards . CHAPTER XL . INTRODUCES MR . PICKWICK TO A NEW AND NOT UNINTERESTING SCENE IN THE GREAT DRAMA OF LIFE The remainder of the period which Mr. Pickwick had assigned as the duration of the stay at Bath passed over without the occurrence of anything material . Trinity term commenced . On the expiration of its first week , Mr. Pickwick and his friends returned to London ; and the former gentleman , attended of course by Sam , straightway repaired to his old quarters at the George and Vulture . On the third morning after their arrival , just as all the clocks in the city were striking nine individually , and somewhere about nine hundred and ninety - nine collectively , Sam was taking the air in George Yard , when a queer sort of fresh - painted vehicle drove up , out of which there jumped with great agility , throwing the reins to a stout man who sat beside him , a queer sort of gentleman , who seemed made for the vehicle , and the vehicle for him . The vehicle was not exactly a gig , neither was it a stanhope . It was not what is currently denominated a dog - cart , neither was it a taxed cart , nor a chaise - cart , nor a guillotined cabriolet ; and yet it had something of the character of each and every of these machines . It was painted a bright yellow , with the shafts and wheels picked out in black ; and the driver sat in the orthodox sporting style , on cushions piled about two feet above the rail . The horse was a bay , a well - looking animal enough ; but with something of a flash and dog - fighting air about him , nevertheless , which accorded both with the vehicle and his master . The master himself was a man of about forty , with black hair , and carefully combed whiskers . He was dressed in a particularly gorgeous manner , with plenty of articles of jewellery about him -- all about three sizes larger than those which are usually worn by gentlemen -- and a rough greatcoat to crown the whole . Into one pocket of this greatcoat , he thrust his left hand the moment he dismounted , while from the other he drew forth , with his right , a very bright and glaring silk handkerchief , with which he whisked a speck or two of dust from his boots , and then , crumpling it in his hand , swaggered up the court . It had not escaped Sam ’s attention that , when this person dismounted , a shabby - looking man in a brown greatcoat shorn of divers buttons , who had been previously slinking about , on the opposite side of the way , crossed over , and remained stationary close by . Having something more than a suspicion of the object of the gentleman ’s visit , Sam preceded him to the George and Vulture , and , turning sharp round , planted himself in the centre of the doorway . ‘
268395	268420	267720	267720	Sam	240	’ said the man in the rough coat , in an imperious tone , attempting at the same time to push his way past . ‘
268430	268441	268534	268538	none o ’ this gammon	15858	’ replied Sam , returning the push with compound interest . ‘
268458	268475	268534	268538	none o ’ this gammon	15858	’ said the owner of the rough coat , raising his voice , and turning white . ‘
268480	268481	268478	268478	Smouch	6982	’ ‘
268489	268511	268534	268538	none o ’ this gammon	15858	’ growled the man in the brown coat , who had been gradually sneaking up the court during this short dialogue . ‘
268521	268531	268534	268538	none o ’ this gammon	15858	’ said the principal , giving Sam another push . ‘
268536	268540	268542	268542	Smouch	665	’ this gammon , ’
268623	268631	268633	268634	the principal	1170	‘ Good - morning , my dear , ’
268655	268666	268633	268634	the principal	1170	‘ which is Mr. Pickwick ’s room , my dear ? ’
268667	268672	268674	268675	the barmaid	9812	‘ Show him up , ’
268805	268812	268814	268815	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Shaving - water , Sam , ’
268822	268830	268832	268833	the visitor	9828	‘ Shave you directly , Mr. Pickwick , ’
268846	268878	268832	268833	the visitor	9828	‘ I ’ve got an execution against you , at the suit of Bardell.--Here ’s the warrant.--Common Pleas.--Here ’s my card . I suppose you ’ll come over to my house . ’
268916	268922	268924	268925	the sheriff	7002	‘ Namby ’s the name , ’
268950	268959	268930	268931	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Namby , Bell Alley , Coleman Street . ’
268983	268989	268991	268991	Sam	356	‘ Are you a Quaker ? ’
268993	269009	269011	269013	the indignant officer	7006	‘ I ’ll let you know I am , before I ’ve done with you , ’
269015	269032	269011	269013	the indignant officer	7006	‘ I ’ll teach you manners , my fine fellow , one of these fine mornings . ’
269033	269036	269038	269038	Sam	356	‘ Thank’ee , ’
269040	269054	269038	269038	Sam	356	‘ I ’ll do the same to you . Take your hat off . ’
269100	269107	269109	269111	the disconcerted officer	7008	‘ Observe this , Mr. Pickwick , ’
269117	269136	269109	269111	the disconcerted officer	7008	‘ I ’ve been assaulted in the execution of my dooty by your servant in your chamber . I ’m

269157	269161	269155	269155	Sir	9716	’ interposed Sam . ‘

269218	269240	269201	269202	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ if you say another word , or offer the slightest interference with this person , I discharge you that instant . ’
269241	269246	269248	269248	Sam	240	‘ But , Sir ! ’
269250	269255	269257	269258	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Hold your tongue , ’
269260	269267	269257	269258	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Take that hat up again . ’

269561	269570	269579	269622	a gentleman who might have passed for a neglected twin - brother of Mr. Smouch , and who was endowed with a large key for the purpose , Mr. Pickwick was shown into the ‘ coffee - room . ’ This coffee - room	7022	‘ Namby , Officer to the Sheriffs of London ’
269613	269618	269641	269642	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ coffee - room . ’
269870	269886	269888	269894	the man who was stirring the fire	7037	‘ You ’d better have the loan of my razor this morning , Mr. Ayresleigh , ’
269905	269933	269935	269936	the other	1197	‘ Thank you , no , I sha n’t want it ; I expect I shall be out , in the course of an hour or so , ’
269977	269989	269991	269997	the gentleman who had offered the razor	7043	‘ Well , I never saw such a game as that , ’
270006	270009	270010	270011	Mr. Price	475	‘ Never ! ’
270045	270055	270057	270057	Price	475	‘ You ’d hardly think , would you now , ’
270064	270111	270057	270057	Price	475	‘ that that chap ’s been here a week yesterday , and never once shaved himself yet , because he feels so certain he ’s going out in half an hour ’s time , thinks he may as well put it off till he gets home ? ’
270112	270116	270118	270119	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Poor man ! ’
270121	270135	270118	270119	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Are his chances of getting out of his difficulties really so great ? ’
270136	270141	270143	270143	Price	475	‘ Chances be d----d , ’
270145	270175	270143	270143	Price	475	‘ he has n’t half the ghost of one . I would n’t give _ that _ for his chance of walking about the streets this time ten years . ’
270191	270201	270203	270204	Mr. Price	475	‘ Give me a sheet of paper , Crookey , ’
270231	270247	270206	270214	the attendant , who in dress and general appearance	7047	‘ and a glass of brandy- and - water , Crookey , d’ye hear ? I ’m
270278	270299	270263	270263	I	0	’ At this facetious speech , the young boy , it is almost needless to say , was fairly convulsed . ‘
270304	270309	270263	270263	I	0	’ said Mr. Price . ‘
270321	270322	270323	270323	Prime	670	’ ‘
270325	270331	270323	270323	Prime	670	’ said the young gentleman . ‘
270343	270347	270340	270340	you	7051	’ said Price . ‘
270355	270356	270348	270348	You	7051	’ ‘
270363	270466	270340	270340	you	7051	’ replied the boy . He had looked at it through the dirty panes of glass in a bar door . Mr. Pickwick , feeling not a little disgusted with this dialogue , as well as with the air and manner of the two beings by whom it had been carried on , was about to inquire whether he could not be accommodated with a private sitting - room , when two or three strangers of genteel appearance entered , at sight of whom the boy threw his cigar into the fire , and whispering to Mr. Price that they had come to ‘
270471	270693	270340	270340	you	7051	’ for him , joined them at a table in the farther end of the room . It would appear , however , that matters were not going to be made all right quite so speedily as the young gentleman anticipated ; for a very long conversation ensued , of which Mr. Pickwick could not avoid hearing certain angry fragments regarding dissolute conduct , and repeated forgiveness . At last , there were very distinct allusions made by the oldest gentleman of the party to one Whitecross Street , at which the young gentleman , notwithstanding his primeness and his spirit , and his knowledge of life into the bargain , reclined his head upon the table , and howled dismally . Very much satisfied with this sudden bringing down of the youth ’s valour , and this effectual lowering of his tone , Mr. Pickwick rang the bell , and was shown , at his own request , into a private room furnished with a carpet , table , chairs , sideboard and sofa , and ornamented with a looking - glass , and various old prints . Here he had the advantage of hearing Mrs. Namby ’s performance on a square piano overhead , while the breakfast was getting ready ; when it came , Mr. Perker came too . ‘
270700	270706	270340	270340	you	7051	’ said the little man , ‘
270718	270799	270800	270802	The little man	2005	’m not sorry for it either , because now you ’ll see the absurdity of this conduct . I ’ve noted down the amount of the taxed costs and damages for which the ca - sa was issued , and we had better settle at once and lose no time . Namby is come home by this time , I dare say . What say you , my dear sir ? Shall I draw a cheque , or will you ? ’
270837	270840	270842	270843	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Perker , ’
270845	270875	270842	270843	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ let me hear no more of this , I beg . I see no advantage in staying here , so I shall go to prison to - night . ’
270876	270889	270891	270891	Perker	362	‘ You ca n’t go to Whitecross Street , my dear Sir , ’
270893	270921	270891	270891	Perker	362	‘ Impossible ! There are sixty beds in a ward ; and the bolt ’s on , sixteen hours out of the four - and - twenty . ’
270922	270937	270939	270940	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I would rather go to some other place of confinement if I can , ’
270942	270956	270939	270940	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ If not , I must make the best I can of that . ’
270957	270971	270891	270891	Perker	362	‘ You can go to the Fleet , my dear Sir , if you ’re
270977	270981	270939	270940	Mr. Pickwick	240	’ said Perker . ‘
270986	270991	270992	270992	I	0	’ said Mr. Pickwick . ‘
271003	271004	270997	270997	I	0	’ ‘
271041	271050	271051	271051	We	7059	’ said the good - natured little attorney . ‘
271078	271079	271072	271072	You	9716	’ ‘
271083	271092	271072	271072	You	9716	’ said Mr. Pickwick , with unmoved patience . ‘
271117	271596	271108	271108	Sam	240	’ Mr. Pickwick remaining firm , despite all the remonstrances and arguments of Perker , the chops appeared and disappeared in due course ; he was then put into another hackney coach , and carried off to Chancery Lane , after waiting half an hour or so for Mr. Namby , who had a select dinner - party and could on no account be disturbed before . There were two judges in attendance at Serjeant ’s Inn -- one King ’s Bench , and one Common Pleas -- and a great deal of business appeared to be transacting before them , if the number of lawyer ’s clerks who were hurrying in and out with bundles of papers , afforded any test . When they reached the low archway which forms the entrance to the inn , Perker was detained a few moments parlaying with the coachman about the fare and the change ; and Mr. Pickwick , stepping to one side to be out of the way of the stream of people that were pouring in and out , looked about him with some curiosity . The people that attracted his attention most , were three or four men of shabby - genteel appearance , who touched their hats to many of the attorneys who passed , and seemed to have some business there , the nature of which Mr. Pickwick could not divine . They were curious - looking fellows . One was a slim and rather lame man in rusty black , and a white neckerchief ; another was a stout , burly person , dressed in the same apparel , with a great reddish - black cloth round his neck ; a third was a little weazen , drunken - looking body , with a pimply face . They were loitering about , with their hands behind them , and now and then with an anxious countenance whispered something in the ear of some of the gentlemen with papers , as they hurried by . Mr. Pickwick remembered to have very often observed them lounging under the archway when he had been walking past ; and his curiosity was quite excited to know to what branch of the profession these dingy - looking loungers could possibly belong . He was about to propound the question to Namby , who kept close beside him , sucking a large gold ring on his little finger , when Perker bustled up , and observing that there was no time to lose , led the way into the inn . As Mr. Pickwick followed , the lame man stepped up to him , and civilly touching his hat , held out a written card , which Mr. Pickwick , not wishing to hurt the man ’s feelings by refusing , courteously accepted and deposited in his waistcoat pocket . ‘
271599	271623	271108	271108	Sam	240	’ said Perker , turning round before he entered one of the offices , to see that his companions were close behind him . ‘
271638	271686	271635	271635	you	1228	’ This last question was addressed to the lame man , who , unobserved by Mr. Pickwick , made one of the party . In reply to it , the lame man touched his hat again , with all imaginable politeness , and motioned towards Mr. Pickwick . ‘
271691	271699	271635	271635	you	1228	’ said Perker , with a smile . ‘

271725	271731	271732	271733	The gentleman	883	’ said the lame man . ‘

271792	271796	271797	271798	The gentleman	883	’ said Perker . ‘
271804	271816	271797	271798	The gentleman	883	’ replied Mr. Pickwick , producing it from his waistcoat pocket . ‘
271847	271893	271846	271846	I--	0	’ The little attorney burst into a loud laugh , and returning the card to the lame man , informing him it was all a mistake , whispered to Mr. Pickwick as the man turned away in dudgeon , that he was only a bail . ‘
271897	271902	271846	271846	I--	0	’ exclaimed Mr. Pickwick . ‘
271906	271910	271846	271846	I--	0	’ replied Perker . ‘

271949	271961	271846	271846	I--	0	’ said Perker , regaling himself with a pinch of snuff . ‘
271999	272010	271965	271965	I	0	’ exclaimed Mr. Pickwick , quite aghast at the disclosure . ‘
272025	272031	272013	272013	I	0	’ replied the little gentleman . ‘
272057	272292	272013	272013	I	0	’ Saying which , the attorney shrugged his shoulders , smiled , took a second pinch of snuff , and led the way into the office of the judge ’s clerk . This was a room of specially dirty appearance , with a very low ceiling and old panelled walls ; and so badly lighted , that although it was broad day outside , great tallow candles were burning on the desks . At one end , was a door leading to the judge ’s private apartment , round which were congregated a crowd of attorneys and managing clerks , who were called in , in the order in which their respective appointments stood upon the file . Every time this door was opened to let a party out , the next party made a violent rush to get in ; and , as in addition to the numerous dialogues which passed between the gentlemen who were waiting to see the judge , a variety of personal squabbles ensued between the greater part of those who had seen him , there was as much noise as could well be raised in an apartment of such confined dimensions . Nor were the conversations of these gentlemen the only sounds that broke upon the ear . Standing on a box behind a wooden bar at another end of the room was a clerk in spectacles who was ‘
272296	272330	272013	272013	I	0	’ ; large batches of which were , from time to time , carried into the private room by another clerk for the judge ’s signature . There were a large number of attorneys ’
272590	272595	272597	272598	the tenor	7100	‘ Sniggle and Blink , ’
272600	272605	272607	272608	the bass	7101	‘ Porkin and Snob , ’
272610	272615	272617	272620	the new - comer	10515	‘ Stumpy and Deacon , ’
272701	272744	272669	272673	the man in the spectacles	7108	‘ Take the book in your right hand this is your name and hand - writing you swear that the contents of this your affidavit are true so help you God a shilling you must get change I have n’t got it . ’
272745	272750	272752	272753	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Well , Sam , ’
272755	272768	272752	272753	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I suppose they are getting the _ Habeas- corpus _ ready ? ’
272769	272772	272774	272774	Sam	240	‘ Yes , ’
272776	272796	272774	272774	Sam	240	‘ and I vish they ’d bring out the have - his - carcase . It ’s wery unpleasant keepin ’

272825	272924	272774	272774	Sam	240	’ What sort of cumbrous and unmanageable machine , Sam Weller imagined a habeas - corpus to be , does not appear ; for Perker , at that moment , walked up and took Mr. Pickwick away . The usual forms having been gone through , the body of Samuel Pickwick was soon afterwards confided to the custody of the tipstaff , to be by him taken to the warden of the Fleet Prison , and there detained until the amount of the damages and costs in the action of Bardell against Pickwick was fully paid and satisfied . ‘
272928	272935	272774	272774	Sam	240	’ said Mr. Pickwick , laughing , ‘
272961	272962	272951	272951	Perker	362	’ ‘
272975	272979	272963	272963	I	0	’ said Perker . ‘
272982	272987	272988	272988	I	0	’ replied Mr. Pickwick , ‘
273028	273064	273065	273069	A most extraordinary man that	7114	’ As Mr. Pickwick said this , he got into the coach which had by this time arrived , followed by the tipstaff . Sam having stationed himself on the box , it rolled away . ‘
273071	273084	273065	273069	A most extraordinary man that	7114	’ said Perker , as he stopped to pull on his gloves . ‘
273094	273104	273092	273092	Sir	9716	’ observed Mr. Lowten , who was standing near . ‘
273115	273128	273112	273112	He	7114	‘ em at defiance if they talked of committing him , Sir . ’
273176	273179	273181	273182	the driver	829	‘ went better ’

273436	273442	273444	273445	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Sitting for my portrait ? ’
273447	273455	273457	273459	the stout turnkey	7138	‘ Having your likeness taken , sir , ’

273546	273551	273553	273554	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Well , Sam , ’
273556	273572	273553	273554	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ then I wish the artists would come . This is rather a public place . ’
273573	273586	273588	273588	Sam	240	‘ They von’t be long , Sir , I des - say , ’
273590	273599	273588	273588	Sam	240	‘ There ’s a Dutch clock , sir . ’
273600	273605	273607	273608	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ So I see , ’
273610	273619	273621	273621	Sam	240	‘ And a bird - cage , sir , ’
273623	273640	273621	273621	Sam	240	‘ Veels vithin veels , a prison in a prison . Ai n’t it , Sir ? ’
273904	273914	273916	273917	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Where am I to sleep to - night ? ’
273919	273932	273934	273936	the stout turnkey	7138	‘ Why , I do n’t rightly know about to - night , ’
273938	273978	273934	273936	the stout turnkey	7138	‘ You ’ll be chummed on somebody to - morrow , and then you ’ll be all snug and comfortable . The first night ’s generally rather unsettled , but you ’ll be set all squares to - morrow . ’

274249	274280	274234	274234	his	883	’ replied Mr. Pickwick , looking down a dark and filthy staircase , which appeared to lead to a range of damp and gloomy stone vaults , beneath the ground , ‘

274331	274336	274322	274322	I	0	’ replied the gentleman , ‘

274361	274366	274358	274359	My friend	9719	’ said Mr. Pickwick , ‘

274390	274399	274367	274367	you	9719	’ replied Mr. Roker , with indignant astonishment ; ‘

274411	274416	274367	274367	you	9719	’ exclaimed Mr. Pickwick . ‘

274474	274561	274656	274657	Mr. Pickwick	240	’ As Roker turned somewhat fiercely upon Mr. Pickwick in saying this , and moreover muttered in an excited fashion certain unpleasant invocations concerning his own eyes , limbs , and circulating fluids , the latter gentleman deemed it advisable to pursue the discourse no further . Mr. Roker then proceeded to mount another staircase , as dirty as that which led to the place which has just been the subject of discussion , in which ascent he was closely followed by Mr. Pickwick and Sam . ‘
274564	274586	274656	274657	Mr. Pickwick	240	’ said Mr. Roker , pausing for breath when they reached another gallery of the same dimensions as the one below , ‘

278086	278637	278675	278675	you	883	’ These expressions , delivered in a most boisterous tone , and accompanied with loud peals of laughter , roused Mr. Pickwick from one of those sound slumbers which , lasting in reality some half - hour , seem to the sleeper to have been protracted for three weeks or a month . The voice had no sooner ceased than the room was shaken with such violence that the windows rattled in their frames , and the bedsteads trembled again . Mr. Pickwick started up , and remained for some minutes fixed in mute astonishment at the scene before him . On the floor of the room , a man in a broad - skirted green coat , with corduroy knee - smalls and gray cotton stockings , was performing the most popular steps of a hornpipe , with a slang and burlesque caricature of grace and lightness , which , combined with the very appropriate character of his costume , was inexpressibly absurd . Another man , evidently very drunk , who had probably been tumbled into bed by his companions , was sitting up between the sheets , warbling as much as he could recollect of a comic song , with the most intensely sentimental feeling and expression ; while a third , seated on one of the bedsteads , was applauding both performers with the air of a profound connoisseur , and encouraging them by such ebullitions of feeling as had already roused Mr. Pickwick from his sleep . This last man was an admirable specimen of a class of gentry which never can be seen in full perfection but in such places -- they may be met with , in an imperfect state , occasionally about stable - yards and Public- houses ; but they never attain their full bloom except in these hot - beds , which would almost seem to be considerately provided by the legislature for the sole purpose of rearing them . He was a tall fellow , with an olive complexion , long dark hair , and very thick bushy whiskers meeting under his chin . He wore no neckerchief , as he had been playing rackets all day , and his open shirt collar displayed their full luxuriance . On his head he wore one of the common eighteenpenny French skull - caps , with a gaudy tassel dangling therefrom , very happily in keeping with a common fustian coat . His legs , which , being long , were afflicted with weakness , graced a pair of Oxford- mixture trousers , made to show the full symmetry of those limbs . Being somewhat negligently braced , however , and , moreover , but imperfectly buttoned , they fell in a series of not the most graceful folds over a pair of shoes sufficiently down at heel to display a pair of very soiled white stockings . There was a rakish , vagabond smartness , and a kind of boastful rascality , about the whole man , that was worth a mine of gold . This figure was the first to perceive that Mr. Pickwick was looking on ; upon which he winked to the Zephyr , and entreated him , with mock gravity , not to wake the gentleman . ‘
278649	278663	278664	278665	the gentleman	883	’ said the Zephyr , turning round and affecting the extremity of surprise ; ‘
278713	278727	278699	278699	you	883	’re sending that way , sir , and say that I would have sent ‘
278745	278746	278784	278784	you	883	’ ‘
278767	278780	278756	278756	you	883	’ said the gentleman with the whiskers , with a jocose air . ‘
278793	278794	278784	278784	you	883	’ ‘
278802	278807	278784	278784	you	883	’ replied the other . ‘
278863	279039	278861	278861	Sir	9716	’ With this , the speaker snatched that article of dress from Mr. Pickwick ’s head , and fixed it in a twinkling on that of the drunken man , who , firmly impressed with the belief that he was delighting a numerous assembly , continued to hammer away at the comic song in the most melancholy strains imaginable . Taking a man ’s nightcap from his brow by violent means , and adjusting it on the head of an unknown gentleman , of dirty exterior , however ingenious a witticism in itself , is unquestionably one of those which come under the denomination of practical jokes . Viewing the matter precisely in this light , Mr. Pickwick , without the slightest intimation of his purpose , sprang vigorously out of bed , struck the Zephyr so smart a blow in the chest as to deprive him of a considerable portion of the commodity which sometimes bears his name , and then , recapturing his nightcap , boldly placed himself in an attitude of defence . ‘
279042	279061	278861	278861	Sir	9716	’ said Mr. Pickwick , gasping no less from excitement than from the expenditure of so much energy , ‘
279073	279193	278861	278861	Sir	9716	’ With this liberal invitation the worthy gentleman communicated a revolving motion to his clenched fists , by way of appalling his antagonists with a display of science . It might have been Mr. Pickwick ’s very unexpected gallantry , or it might have been the complicated manner in which he had got himself out of bed , and fallen all in a mass upon the hornpipe man , that touched his adversaries . Touched they were ; for , instead of then and there making an attempt to commit man - slaughter , as Mr. Pickwick implicitly believed they would have done , they paused , stared at each other a short time , and finally laughed outright . ‘
279197	279211	279213	279214	the Zephyr	16060	’re a trump , and I like you all the better for it , ’
279216	279236	279238	279239	the man	835	‘ Now jump into bed again , or you ’ll catch the rheumatics . No malice , I hope ? ’
279261	279265	279267	279268	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Certainly not , ’
279293	279301	279303	279307	the gentleman with the whiskers	6282	‘ Allow me the H - onour , ’
279318	279325	279327	279328	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ With much pleasure , sir , ’
279346	279354	279356	279360	the man with the whiskers	7303	‘ My name is Smangle , sir , ’
279362	279365	279367	279368	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Oh , ’
279370	279375	279377	279381	the man in the stockings	7304	‘ Mine is Mivins , ’
279383	279393	279395	279396	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I am delighted to hear it , sir , ’
279398	279401	279403	279404	Mr. Smangle	682	‘ Hem , ’
279406	279413	279415	279416	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Did you speak , sir ? ’
279418	279427	279429	279430	Mr. Smangle	682	‘ No , I did not , sir , ’
279495	279505	279507	279508	Mr. Smangle	682	‘ Are you going through the court , sir ? ’
279510	279515	279517	279518	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Through the what ? ’
279520	279537	279517	279518	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Through the court -- Portugal Street -- the Court for Relief of -- you know . ’
279538	279543	279545	279546	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Oh , no , ’
279548	279555	279545	279546	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ No , I am not . ’
279556	279562	279564	279565	Mr. Mivins	683	‘ Going out , perhaps ? ’
279567	279572	279574	279575	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I fear not , ’
279577	279591	279574	279575	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I refuse to pay some damages , and am here in consequence . ’
279592	279595	279597	279598	Mr. Smangle	682	‘ Ah , ’
279600	279607	279597	279598	Mr. Smangle	682	‘ paper has been my ruin . ’
279608	279617	279619	279620	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ A stationer , I presume , Sir ? ’
279623	279653	279619	279620	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Stationer ! No , no ; confound and curse me ! Not so low as that . No trade . When I say paper , I mean bills . ’
279654	279668	279670	279671	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Oh , you use the word in that sense . I see , ’
279673	279682	279684	279684	Smangle	682	‘ Damme ! A gentleman must expect reverses , ’
279686	279707	279684	279684	Smangle	682	‘ What of that ? Here am I in the Fleet Prison . Well ; good . What then ? I ’m
279717	279718	279619	279620	Mr. Pickwick	240	’ ‘
279723	279789	279619	279620	Mr. Pickwick	240	’ replied Mr. Mivins . And he was quite right ; for , so far from Mr. Smangle being any the worse for it , he was something the better , inasmuch as to qualify himself for the place , he had attained gratuitous possession of certain articles of jewellery , which , long before that , had found their way to the pawnbroker ’s . ‘
279795	279800	279826	279826	Mivins	683	’ said Mr. Smangle ; ‘
279854	279900	279901	279901	I	0	’ Unwilling to hazard another quarrel , Mr. Pickwick gladly assented to the proposition , and consigned the money to Mr. Mivins , who , as it was nearly eleven o’clock , lost no time in repairing to the coffee - room on his errand . ‘
279904	279917	279920	279920	you	683	’ whispered Smangle , the moment his friend had left the room ; ‘
279924	279925	279920	279920	you	683	’ ‘
279930	279935	279926	279928	Half a sovereign	7309	’ said Mr. Pickwick . ‘
279944	279959	279936	279936	He	7308	’ said Mr. Smangle;--‘infernal pleasant . I do n’t know anybody more so ; but-- ’
279972	279991	279993	279994	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ You do n’t think there is any probability of his appropriating the money to his own use ? ’
279996	280020	280022	280023	Mr. Smangle	682	‘ Oh , no ! Mind , I do n’t say that ; I expressly say that he ’s a devilish gentlemanly fellow , ’
280025	280091	280022	280023	Mr. Smangle	682	‘ But I think , perhaps , if somebody went down , just to see that he did n’t dip his beak into the jug by accident , or make some confounded mistake in losing the money as he came upstairs , it would be as well . Here , you sir , just run downstairs , and look after that gentleman , will you ? ’
280133	280143	280145	280145	Smangle	682	‘ You know where the coffee - room is , ’
280147	280185	280187	280187	Smangle	682	‘ just run down , and tell that gentleman you ’ve come to help him up with the jug . Or -- stop-- I ’ll tell you what -- I’ll tell you how we ’ll do him , ’
280194	280197	280199	280200	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ How ? ’
280202	280234	280236	280236	Smangle	682	‘ Send down word that he ’s to spend the change in cigars . Capital thought . Run and tell him that ; d’ye hear ? They sha n’t be wasted , ’
280243	280249	280236	280236	Smangle	682	‘ _ I ’ll _ smoke ‘
280252	280612	280236	280236	Smangle	682	’ This manoeuvring was so exceedingly ingenious and , withal , performed with such immovable composure and coolness , that Mr. Pickwick would have had no wish to disturb it , even if he had had the power . In a short time Mr. Mivins returned , bearing the sherry , which Mr. Smangle dispensed in two little cracked mugs ; considerately remarking , with reference to himself , that a gentleman must not be particular under such circumstances , and that , for his part , he was not too proud to drink out of the jug . In which , to show his sincerity , he forthwith pledged the company in a draught which half emptied it . An excellent understanding having been by these means promoted , Mr. Smangle proceeded to entertain his hearers with a relation of divers romantic adventures in which he had been from time to time engaged , involving various interesting anecdotes of a thoroughbred horse , and a magnificent Jewess , both of surpassing beauty , and much coveted by the nobility and gentry of these kingdoms . Long before these elegant extracts from the biography of a gentleman were concluded , Mr. Mivins had betaken himself to bed , and had set in snoring for the night , leaving the timid stranger and Mr. Pickwick to the full benefit of Mr. Smangle ’s experiences . Nor were the two last - named gentlemen as much edified as they might have been by the moving passages narrated . Mr. Pickwick had been in a state of slumber for some time , when he had a faint perception of the drunken man bursting out afresh with the comic song , and receiving from Mr. Smangle a gentle intimation , through the medium of the water - jug , that his audience was not musically disposed . Mr. Pickwick then once again dropped off to sleep , with a confused consciousness that Mr. Smangle was still engaged in relating a long story , the chief point of which appeared to be that , on some occasion particularly stated and set forth , he had ‘
280614	280654	280236	280236	Smangle	682	’ a bill and a gentleman at the same time . CHAPTER XLII . ILLUSTRATIVE , LIKE THE PRECEDING ONE , OF THE OLD PROVERB , THAT ADVERSITY BRINGS A MAN ACQUAINTED WITH STRANGE BEDFELLOWS-- LIKEWISE CONTAINING MR . PICKWICK ’S
280827	280836	280838	280839	Mr. Smangle	682	‘ Well ; will you know me again ? ’
280845	280855	280857	280857	Sam	356	‘ I ’d svear to you anyveres , Sir , ’
280860	280871	280873	280874	Mr. Smangle	682	‘ Do n’t be impertinent to a gentleman , Sir , ’
280876	280882	280884	280884	Sam	356	‘ Not on no account , ’
280886	280908	280884	280884	Sam	356	‘ If you ’ll tell me wen he wakes , I ’ll be upon the wery best extra - super behaviour ! ’
280929	280932	280934	280935	Mr. Smangle	682	‘ Mivins ! ’
280942	280948	280950	280954	that gentleman from his couch	7315	‘ What ’s the office ? ’
280956	280964	280950	280954	that gentleman from his couch	7315	‘ Who the devil is this fellow ? ’
280965	280966	280934	280935	Mr. Smangle	682	‘ ’
280969	280984	280934	280935	Mr. Smangle	682	’ said Mr. Mivins , looking lazily out from under the bed - clothes , ‘
281001	281002	280950	280954	that gentleman from his couch	7315	’ ‘
281005	281010	280950	280954	that gentleman from his couch	7315	’ replied Mr. Smangle . ‘
281032	281074	281075	281075	Sam	240	’ rejoined Mr. Mivins ; with this prompt advice that excellent gentleman again betook himself to slumber . The conversation exhibiting these unequivocal symptoms of verging on the personal , Mr. Pickwick deemed it a fit point at which to interpose . ‘
281077	281082	281075	281075	Sam	240	’ said Mr. Pickwick . ‘
281085	281090	281075	281075	Sam	240	’ rejoined that gentleman . ‘
281099	281100	281101	281102	Nothin’ partickler	7319	’ ‘
281106	281117	281104	281104	sir	9716	’ replied Sam , glancing at Mr. Smangle ’s whiskers ; ‘
281140	281148	281104	281104	sir	9716	’ and sangvinary natur ; but vith that ‘
281156	281157	281158	281158	I	0	’ ‘
281163	281168	281158	281158	I	0	’ said Mr. Pickwick ; ‘
281175	281278	281158	281158	I	0	’ Whatever hostile intentions Mr. Smangle might have entertained , his thoughts were speedily diverted by the unpacking of the portmanteau ; the contents of which appeared to impress him at once with a most favourable opinion , not only of Mr. Pickwick , but of Sam also , who , he took an early opportunity of declaring in a tone of voice loud enough for that eccentric personage to overhear , was a regular thoroughbred original , and consequently the very man after his own heart . As to Mr. Pickwick , the affection he conceived for him knew no limits . ‘
281293	281297	281283	281283	I	0	’ said Smangle . ‘
281311	281316	281305	281305	I	0	’ replied Mr. Pickwick . ‘
281412	281441	281445	281445	you	9716	’ Thus spake Mr. Smangle , edging himself meanwhile as near as possible to the portmanteau , and beaming forth looks of the most fervent and disinterested friendship . ‘
281463	281467	281445	281445	you	9716	’ resumed Smangle . ‘
281475	281487	281445	281445	you	9716	’ rejoined Sam , taking the reply into his own mouth . ‘
281503	281528	281445	281445	you	9716	‘ ud be more agreeable for all parties , as the schoolmaster said when the young gentleman objected to being flogged by the butler . ’
281529	281551	281553	281553	Smangle	682	‘ And there ’s nothing I can send in my little box to the washer - woman ’s , is there ? ’
281569	281575	281577	281577	Sam	240	‘ Nothin’ whatever , Sir , ’

281857	281878	281849	281850	that gentleman	9760	‘ Plenty of that , Mr. Pickwick . Your chummage ticket will be on twenty- seven , in the third . ’
281879	281882	281884	281885	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Oh , ’
281887	281895	281884	281885	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ My what , did you say ? ’
281896	281901	281903	281904	Mr. Roker	677	‘ Your chummage ticket , ’
281906	281908	281903	281904	Mr. Roker	677	‘ you ’re

281918	281927	281903	281904	Mr. Roker	677	’ replied Mr. Pickwick , with a smile . ‘
281930	281935	281884	281885	Mr. Pickwick	240	’ said Mr. Roker , ‘
281969	281970	281958	281958	them	7340	’ ‘
281977	281983	281958	281958	them	7340	’ inquired Mr. Pickwick dubiously . ‘
281986	281995	281958	281958	them	7340	’ replied Mr. Roker . Mr. Pickwick coughed . ‘
281998	282004	282006	282007	Mr. Roker	677	‘ em ’s a parson , ’
282020	282026	282006	282007	Mr. Roker	677	‘ another ’s a butcher . ’

282035	282039	282041	282042	Mr. Roker	677	‘ A butcher , ’
282064	282086	282088	282088	Roker	677	‘ What a thorough - paced goer he used to be sure - ly ! You remember Tom Martin , Neddy ? ’
282119	282125	282127	282138	the party addressed , with a strong emphasis on the personal pronoun	7344	‘ I should think so , ’
282140	282146	282148	282149	Mr. Roker	677	‘ Bless my dear eyes ! ’
282185	282241	282173	282173	he	677	‘ it seems but yesterday that he whopped the coal - heaver down Fox - under- the - Hill by the wharf there . I think I can see him now , a - coming up the Strand between the two street - keepers , a little sobered by the bruising , with a patch o ’

282341	282351	282353	282354	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Do you know what the third gentlemen is ? ’
282368	282376	282378	282379	Mr. Roker	677	‘ What is that Simpson , Neddy ? ’
282386	282390	282392	282392	Neddy	687	‘ What Simpson ? ’
282394	282416	282392	282392	Neddy	687	‘ Why , him in twenty - seven in the third , that this gentleman ’s going to be chummed on . ’
282417	282422	282424	282424	Neddy	687	‘ Oh , him ! ’
282426	282446	282424	282424	Neddy	687	‘ he ’s nothing exactly . He _ was _ a horse chaunter : he ’s a leg now . ’
282447	282454	282456	282457	Mr. Roker	677	‘ Ah , so I thought , ’
282476	282484	282424	282424	Neddy	687	‘ That ’s the ticket , sir . ’
282609	282620	282622	282623	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Which is twenty - seven , my good fellow ? ’
282625	282631	282633	282636	the pot - boy	5655	‘ Five doors farther on , ’
282638	282659	282633	282636	the pot - boy	5655	‘ There ’s the likeness of a man being hung , and smoking the while , chalked outside the door . ’
282676	282682	282696	282696	his	240	‘ portrait of a gentleman , ’
282864	282868	282870	282871	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I believe , ’
282886	282887	282870	282871	Mr. Pickwick	240	’ ‘
282890	282895	282870	282871	Mr. Pickwick	240	’ replied the gentleman . ‘
282909	282914	282896	282896	I	0	’ rejoined Mr. Pickwick . ‘
282919	282928	282896	282896	I	0	’ said the gentleman . Mr. Pickwick complied . ‘
282939	283064	283065	283065	Butcher	7364	’ said Mr. Simpson ( for it was the leg ) , after a very discontented sort of a pause . Mr. Pickwick thought so also ; but , under all the circumstances , he considered it a matter of sound policy to be silent . Mr. Simpson mused for a few moments after this , and then , thrusting his head out of the window , gave a shrill whistle , and pronounced some word aloud , several times . What the word was , Mr. Pickwick could not distinguish ; but he rather inferred that it must be some nickname which distinguished Mr. Martin , from the fact of a great number of gentlemen on the ground below , immediately proceeding to cry ‘
283067	283226	283065	283065	Butcher	7364	’ in imitation of the tone in which that useful class of society are wo nt , diurnally , to make their presence known at area railings . Subsequent occurrences confirmed the accuracy of Mr. Pickwick ’s impression ; for , in a few seconds , a gentleman , prematurely broad for his years , clothed in a professional blue jean frock and top - boots with circular toes , entered the room nearly out of breath , closely followed by another gentleman in very shabby black , and a sealskin cap . The latter gentleman , who fastened his coat all the way up to his chin by means of a pin and a button alternately , had a very coarse red face , and looked like a drunken chaplain ; which , indeed , he was . These two gentlemen having by turns perused Mr. Pickwick ’s billet , the one expressed his opinion that it was ‘
283230	283239	283065	283065	Butcher	7364	’ and the other his conviction that it was ‘
283243	283266	283065	283065	Butcher	7364	’ Having recorded their feelings in these very intelligible terms , they looked at Mr. Pickwick and each other in awkward silence . ‘
283282	283345	283346	283347	Mr. Martin	351	’ said the chaplain , looking at three dirty mattresses , each rolled up in a blanket ; which occupied one corner of the room during the day , and formed a kind of slab , on which were placed an old cracked basin , ewer , and soap - dish , of common yellow earthenware , with a blue flower--‘very aggravating . ’
283540	283549	283551	283552	the butcher	7371	‘ I suppose this can be managed somehow , ’
283560	283569	283551	283552	the butcher	7371	‘ What will you take to go out ? ’
283575	283580	283551	283552	the butcher	7371	’ replied Mr. Pickwick . ‘
283591	283592	283583	283583	you	7371	’ ‘
283602	283607	283608	283610	The regular chummage	7372	’ said the butcher . ‘
283624	283625	283621	283622	three bob	7373	’ ‘
283630	283636	283621	283622	three bob	7373	’ suggested the clerical gentleman . ‘
283653	283658	283661	283661	you	7371	’ said Mr. Martin . ‘
283682	283683	283661	283661	you	7371	’ ‘
283692	283698	283661	283661	you	7371	’ chimed in Mr. Simpson . ‘
283701	283702	283661	283661	you	7371	’ ‘
283710	283715	283661	283661	you	7371	’ said the chaplain . ‘
283718	283719	283720	283720	I	0	’ ‘
283733	283738	283745	283745	you	7371	’ returned Mr. Pickwick , ‘
283759	283805	283753	283753	I	0	’ At this inquiry Mr. Martin looked , with a countenance of excessive surprise , at his two friends , and then each gentleman pointed with his right thumb over his left shoulder . This action imperfectly described in words by the very feeble term of ‘
283810	283846	283753	283753	I	0	’ when performed by any number of ladies or gentlemen who are accustomed to act in unison , has a very graceful and airy effect ; its expression is one of light and playful sarcasm . ‘
283852	283863	283753	283753	I	0	’ repeated Mr. Martin , with a smile of pity . ‘
283887	283893	283876	283876	I	0	’ said the clerical gentleman . ‘
283898	284057	283896	283896	I	0	’ added the sporting one solemnly . After this introductory preface , the three chums informed Mr. Pickwick , in a breath , that money was , in the Fleet , just what money was out of it ; that it would instantly procure him almost anything he desired ; and that , supposing he had it , and had no objection to spend it , if he only signified his wish to have a room to himself , he might take possession of one , furnished and fitted to boot , in half an hour ’s time . With this the parties separated , very much to their common satisfaction ; Mr. Pickwick once more retracing his steps to the lodge , and the three companions adjourning to the coffee - room , there to spend the five shillings which the clerical gentleman had , with admirable prudence and foresight , borrowed of him for the purpose . ‘
284062	284083	284058	284058	I	0	’ said Mr. Roker , with a chuckle , when Mr. Pickwick stated the object with which he had returned . ‘
284092	284104	284105	284105	I	0	’ The philosophical owner of the universal penknife growled an affirmative . ‘
284118	284123	284105	284105	I	0	’ said Mr. Roker . ‘
284150	284151	284134	284134	You	687	’ ‘
284156	284161	284134	284134	You	687	’ replied Mr. Pickwick . ‘
284182	284187	284188	284188	It	7377	’ said Mr. Roker . ‘
284206	284207	284200	284200	you	687	’ ‘
284212	284217	284200	284200	you	687	’ said Mr. Pickwick . ‘
284224	284236	284200	284200	you	687	’ said Roker , taking up his hat with great alacrity ; ‘
284263	284462	284250	284250	you	687	’ The matter was soon arranged , as the turnkey had foretold . The Chancery prisoner had been there long enough to have lost his friends , fortune , home , and happiness , and to have acquired the right of having a room to himself . As he laboured , however , under the inconvenience of often wanting a morsel of bread , he eagerly listened to Mr. Pickwick ’s proposal to rent the apartment , and readily covenanted and agreed to yield him up the sole and undisturbed possession thereof , in consideration of the weekly payment of twenty shillings ; from which fund he furthermore contracted to pay out any person or persons that might be chummed upon it . As they struck the bargain , Mr. Pickwick surveyed him with a painful interest . He was a tall , gaunt , cadaverous man , in an old greatcoat and slippers , with sunken cheeks , and a restless , eager eye . His lips were bloodless , and his bones sharp and thin . God help him ! the iron teeth of confinement and privation had been slowly filing him down for twenty years . ‘
284472	284530	284531	284531	I	0	’ said Mr. Pickwick , as he laid the amount of the first week ’s rent , in advance , on the tottering table . The man gathered up the money with a trembling hand , and replied that he did n’t know yet ; he must go and see where he could move his bed to . ‘
284537	284590	284531	284531	I	0	’ said Mr. Pickwick , laying his hand gently and compassionately on his arm--‘I am afraid you will have to live in some noisy , crowded place . Now , pray , consider this room your own when you want quiet , or when any of your friends come to see you . ’
284591	284594	284596	284597	the man	835	‘ Friends ! ’
284608	284747	284596	284597	the man	835	‘ if I lay dead at the bottom of the deepest mine in the world ; tight screwed down and soldered in my coffin ; rotting in the dark and filthy ditch that drags its slime along , beneath the foundations of this prison ; I could not be more forgotten or unheeded than I am here . I am a dead man ; dead to society , without the pity they bestow on those whose souls have passed to judgment . Friends to see me ! My God ! I have sunk , from the prime of life into old age , in this place , and there is not one to raise his hand above my bed when I lie dead upon it , and say , “ It is a blessing he is gone ! ” ’
284791	284796	284798	284799	Mr. Roker	677	‘ Rides rather rusty , ’
284805	284809	284798	284799	Mr. Roker	677	‘ Ah ! they ’re
284824	284828	284814	284814	They	7387	‘ em wild ! ’
284899	284912	284914	284915	Mr. Roker	677	‘ Now , is there anything more we can do for you ? ’
284936	284941	284943	284944	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Why , yes , ’
284955	284970	284943	284944	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Are there any people here who run on errands , and so forth ? ’
284971	284978	284980	284981	Mr. Roker	677	‘ Outside , do you mean ? ’
284983	284998	284980	284981	Mr. Roker	677	‘ Yes . I mean who are able to go outside . Not prisoners . ’
284999	285005	285007	285007	Roker	677	‘ Yes , there is , ’
285009	285057	285007	285007	Roker	677	‘ There ’s an unfortunate devil , who has got a friend on the poor side , that ’s glad to do anything of that sort . He ’s been running odd jobs , and that , for the last two months . Shall I send him ? ’
285058	285063	285065	285066	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ If you please , ’
285068	285094	285065	285066	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Stay ; no . The poor side , you say ? I should like to see it . I ’ll go to him myself . ’
285252	285266	285226	285237	some man of hungry looks , who , from time to time	7401	‘ Pray , remember the poor debtors ; pray remember the poor debtors . ’
286088	286092	286094	286094	Job	419	‘ Mr. Pickwick ! ’
286097	286100	286102	286102	Jingle	419	‘ Eh ? ’
286109	286129	286102	286102	Jingle	419	‘ Mr ---- ! So it is -- queer place -- strange things -- serves me right -- very . ’
286209	286224	286225	286225	I	0	’ explanation could have done . Mr. Pickwick looked mildly at Jingle , and said-- ‘
286243	286244	286236	286236	you	419	’ ‘
286247	286254	286236	286236	you	419	’ said Jingle , rising hastily . ‘
286294	286295	286296	286296	You	419	’ ‘
286302	286322	286296	286296	You	419	’ said Mr. Pickwick , as they walked out to the staircase , and closed the door after them . ‘
286325	286329	286323	286323	Eh	7444	’ said Jingle . ‘
286355	286356	286359	286359	you	419	’ ‘
286362	286363	286359	286359	you	419	’ ‘
286405	286406	286359	286359	you	419	’ ‘
286426	286449	286359	286359	you	419	’ exclaimed Mr. Pickwick , who had only heard of such things in shipwrecks or read of them in Constable ’s Miscellany . ‘
286452	286460	286359	286359	you	419	’ said Jingle , nodding his head . ‘
286477	286478	286493	286493	I	0	’ ‘
286481	286492	286495	286495	you	419	’ said Mr. Pickwick , much relieved by this explanation ; ‘
286503	286504	286497	286497	You	419	’ ‘
286581	286641	286642	286643	Good fellow	13492	’ Jingle delivered this singular summary of his prospects in life , with his accustomed volubility , and with various twitches of the countenance to counterfeit smiles . Mr. Pickwick easily perceived that his recklessness was assumed , and looking him full , but not unkindly , in the face , saw that his eyes were moist with tears . ‘
286645	286659	286642	286643	Good fellow	13492	’ said Jingle , pressing his hand , and turning his head away . ‘
286689	286733	286836	286836	sir	9716	’ Wholly unable to keep up appearances any longer , and perhaps rendered worse by the effort he had made , the dejected stroller sat down on the stairs , and , covering his face with his hands , sobbed like a child . ‘
286738	286747	286836	286836	sir	9716	’ said Mr. Pickwick , with considerable emotion , ‘
286773	286774	286777	286777	sir	9716	’ ‘
286779	286833	286777	286777	sir	9716	’ replied Job , presenting himself on the staircase . We have described him , by the bye , as having deeply - sunken eyes , in the best of times . In his present state of want and distress , he looked as if those features had gone out of town altogether . ‘
286838	286842	286836	286836	sir	9716	’ cried Job . ‘
286848	286867	286846	286846	sir	9716	’ said Mr. Pickwick , trying to look stern , with four large tears running down his waistcoat . ‘
286873	287072	286871	286871	sir	9716	’ Take what ? In the ordinary acceptation of such language , it should have been a blow . As the world runs , it ought to have been a sound , hearty cuff ; for Mr. Pickwick had been duped , deceived , and wronged by the destitute outcast who was now wholly in his power . Must we tell the truth ? It was something from Mr. Pickwick ’s waistcoat pocket , which chinked as it was given into Job ’s hand , and the giving of which , somehow or other imparted a sparkle to the eye , and a swelling to the heart , of our excellent old friend , as he hurried away . Sam had returned when Mr. Pickwick reached his own room , and was inspecting the arrangements that had been made for his comfort , with a kind of grim satisfaction which was very pleasant to look upon . Having a decided objection to his master ’s being there at all , Mr. Weller appeared to consider it a high moral duty not to appear too much pleased with anything that was done , said , suggested , or proposed . ‘
287077	287082	287075	287075	Sam	356	’ said Mr. Pickwick . ‘
287087	287092	287085	287085	sir	9716	’ replied Mr. Weller . ‘
287101	287102	287099	287099	Sam	356	’ ‘
287108	287120	287106	287106	sir	9716	’ responded Sam , looking round him in a disparaging manner . ‘
287131	287132	287122	287122	you	9716	’ ‘
287140	287147	287135	287135	I	0	‘ em , sir , and they ’re

287175	287184	287185	287186	Mr. Weller	356	‘ You have brought the things I wanted ? ’
287211	287217	287219	287220	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Very well , Sam , ’
287227	287239	287219	287220	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ listen to what I am going to say , Sam . ’
287240	287245	287247	287248	Mr. Weller	356	‘ Cert’nly , Sir , ’
287250	287256	287247	287248	Mr. Weller	356	‘ fire away , Sir . ’
287257	287267	287269	287270	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I have felt from the first , Sam , ’
287276	287290	287269	287270	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ that this is not the place to bring a young man to . ’
287291	287295	287247	287248	Mr. Weller	356	‘ Nor an old ‘
287301	287306	287299	287299	Sir	9716	’ observed Mr. Weller . ‘
287308	287314	287316	287317	Mr. Pickwick	240	’re quite right , Sam , ’
287319	287376	287316	287317	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ but old men may come here through their own heedlessness and unsuspicion , and young men may be brought here by the selfishness of those they serve . It is better for those young men , in every point of view , that they should not remain here . Do you understand me , Sam ? ’
287377	287389	287391	287392	Mr. Weller	356	‘ Vy no , Sir , I do _ not _ , ’
287395	287400	287402	287403	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Try , Sam , ’

287528	287533	287526	287526	Sam	240	’ said Mr. Pickwick , ‘

287554	287561	287537	287537	you	240	’ rejoined Mr. Weller rather sarcastically . ‘
287572	287577	287578	287578	Your	240	’ said Mr. Pickwick . ‘
287619	287643	287617	287617	Sam	240	’ added Mr. Pickwick , with assumed cheerfulness--‘if I do , I pledge you my word that you shall return to me instantly . ’
287644	287656	287658	287659	Mr. Weller	356	‘ Now I ’ll tell you wot it is , Sir , ’

288348	288496	288655	288655	I	0	’ wigs are ill - powdered , and their curls lack crispness . But the attorneys , who sit at a large bare table below the commissioners , are , after all , the greatest curiosities . The professional establishment of the more opulent of these gentlemen , consists of a blue bag and a boy ; generally a youth of the Jewish persuasion . They have no fixed offices , their legal business being transacted in the parlours of public - houses , or the yards of prisons , whither they repair in crowds , and canvass for customers after the manner of omnibus cads . They are of a greasy and mildewed appearance ; and if they can be said to have any vices at all , perhaps drinking and cheating are the most conspicuous among them . Their residences are usually on the outskirts of ‘
288500	288654	288655	288655	I	0	’ chiefly lying within a circle of one mile from the obelisk in St. George ’s Fields . Their looks are not prepossessing , and their manners are peculiar . Mr. Solomon Pell , one of this learned body , was a fat , flabby , pale man , in a surtout which looked green one minute , and brown the next , with a velvet collar of the same chameleon tints . His forehead was narrow , his face wide , his head large , and his nose all on one side , as if Nature , indignant with the propensities she observed in him in his birth , had given it an angry tweak which it had never recovered . Being short - necked and asthmatic , however , he respired principally through this feature ; so , perhaps , what it wanted in ornament , it made up in usefulness . ‘
288656	288664	288666	288667	Mr. Pell	689	’m sure to bring him through it , ’
288669	288675	288666	288667	Mr. Pell	689	‘ Are you , though ? ’
288686	288690	288692	288692	Pell	689	‘ Certain sure , ’
288694	288717	288692	288692	Pell	689	‘ but if he ’d gone to any irregular practitioner , mind you , I would n’t have answered for the consequences . ’

288730	288738	288740	288741	Mr. Pell	689	‘ No , that I would n’t , ’
288833	288839	288841	288843	the old gentleman	10238	‘ And vere is George ? ’

289091	289098	289100	289102	the embarrassed gentleman	7532	‘ All right , old feller , ’
289104	289114	289116	289117	Mr. Weller	356	‘ Is the gray mare made over to anybody ? ’
289126	289134	289136	289137	Mr. Weller	356	‘ Vell , that ’s all right , ’

290039	290044	290083	290083	he	7541	’ argued Mr. Pell , ‘
290050	290051	290083	290083	he	7541	’ ‘
290055	290060	290083	290083	he	7541	’ said Mr. Weller . ‘

290071	290081	290083	290083	he	7541	’ replied Mr. Weller , after a little reflection . ‘
290090	290097	290083	290083	he	7541	’ course that was another thing . ’
290098	290104	290106	290107	Mr. Pell	689	‘ Of course it was , ’
290109	290119	290106	290107	Mr. Pell	689	‘ The distinction ’s obvious , you will perceive . ’
290120	290126	290128	290129	Mr. Weller	356	‘ Alters the case entirely , ’
290131	290137	290128	290129	Mr. Weller	356	‘ Go on , Sir . ’
290148	290160	290146	290146	Sir	9716	’ said Mr. Pell , in a low and serious tone . ‘
290274	290514	290515	290515	Samivel	493	’ Thus delivering himself , Mr. Pell thrust his hands into his pockets , and , frowning grimly around , rattled three halfpence with terrible determination . This virtuous resolution had scarcely been formed , when the boy and the blue bag , who were inseparable companions , rushed violently into the room , and said ( at least the boy did , for the blue bag took no part in the announcement ) that the case was coming on directly . The intelligence was no sooner received than the whole party hurried across the street , and began to fight their way into court -- a preparatory ceremony , which has been calculated to occupy , in ordinary cases , from twenty - five minutes to thirty . Mr. Weller , being stout , cast himself at once into the crowd , with the desperate hope of ultimately turning up in some place which would suit him . His success was not quite equal to his expectations ; for having neglected to take his hat off , it was knocked over his eyes by some unseen person , upon whose toes he had alighted with considerable force . Apparently this individual regretted his impetuosity immediately afterwards , for , muttering an indistinct exclamation of surprise , he dragged the old man out into the hall , and , after a violent struggle , released his head and face . ‘
290517	290535	290515	290515	Samivel	493	’ exclaimed Mr. Weller , when he was thus enabled to behold his rescuer . Sam nodded . ‘

290882	290953	290877	290877	I	0	’ replied the junior . Mr. Weller seized his son ’s hand , clasped it , and let it fall . There was an expression on his countenance in doing so -- not of dismay or apprehension , but partaking more of the sweet and gentle character of hope . A gleam of resignation , and even of cheerfulness , passed over his face too , as he slowly said , ‘

291235	291248	291233	291233	Sammy	356	’ exclaimed Mr. Weller . Sam nodded his concurrence in the opinion . ‘
291257	291263	291255	291255	Sammy	356	’ said Mr. Weller metaphorically , ‘

292410	292765	292364	292364	Sam	356	’ Deferring to his son ’s feeling upon this point , Mr. Weller at once sought the erudite Solomon Pell , and acquainted him with his desire to issue a writ , instantly , for the _ sum _ of twenty - five pounds , and costs of process ; to be executed without delay upon the body of one Samuel Weller ; the charges thereby incurred , to be paid in advance to Solomon Pell . The attorney was in high glee , for the embarrassed coach - horser was ordered to be discharged forthwith . He highly approved of Sam ’s attachment to his master ; declared that it strongly reminded him of his own feelings of devotion to his friend , the Chancellor ; and at once led the elder Mr. Weller down to the Temple , to swear the affidavit of debt , which the boy , with the assistance of the blue bag , had drawn up on the spot . Meanwhile , Sam , having been formally introduced to the whitewashed gentleman and his friends , as the offspring of Mr. Weller , of the Belle Savage , was treated with marked distinction , and invited to regale himself with them in honour of the occasion -- an invitation which he was by no means backward in accepting . The mirth of gentlemen of this class is of a grave and quiet character , usually ; but the present instance was one of peculiar festivity , and they relaxed in proportion . After some rather tumultuous toasting of the Chief Commissioner and Mr. Solomon Pell , who had that day displayed such transcendent abilities , a mottled - faced gentleman in a blue shawl proposed that somebody should sing a song . The obvious suggestion was , that the mottled - faced gentleman , being anxious for a song , should sing it himself ; but this the mottled - faced gentleman sturdily , and somewhat offensively , declined to do . Upon which , as is not unusual in such cases , a rather angry colloquy ensued . ‘

We would beg to call particular attention to the monosyllable at the end of the second and fourth lines , which not only enables the singer to take breath at those points , but greatly assists the metre .

293248	293294	293238	293238	I	0	’ As the mottled - faced gentleman spoke with great energy and determination , and as the opinions of the company seemed divided on the subject , it threatened to give rise to fresh altercation , when Mr. Weller and Mr. Pell most opportunely arrived . ‘
293300	293305	293298	293298	Sammy	356	’ said Mr. Weller . ‘
293315	293320	293306	293307	The officer	1158	’ said Mr. Pell . ‘
293336	293337	293298	293298	Sammy	356	’ ‘

293387	293401	293403	293403	Sam	356	‘ I ’ll give bills for the amount , at sixpence a month , ’

293413	293418	293403	293403	Sam	356	’ said Mr. Weller . ‘
293431	293447	293403	293403	Sam	356	’ said Mr. Solomon Pell , who was making out his little bill of costs ; ‘
293459	293477	293454	293454	Benjamin	657	’ And Mr. Pell smiled again , as he called Mr. Weller ’s attention to the amount . ‘
293484	293508	293482	293482	you	356	’ said the professional gentleman , taking up another of the greasy notes as Mr. Weller took it from the pocket - book . ‘
293558	293574	293548	293550	a young man	1698	’ added Mr. Pell , smiling smoothly round , as he buttoned up the money . ‘
293581	293592	293593	293596	A reg’lar prodigy son	7606	’ said the elder Mr. Weller , with a chuckle . ‘

293607	293614	293605	293605	Sir	9716	’ suggested Mr. Pell , mildly . ‘
293620	293628	293618	293618	Sir	9716	’ said Mr. Weller , with dignity . ‘
293649	293898	293647	293647	Sir	9716	’ By the time the officer arrived , Sam had made himself so extremely popular , that the congregated gentlemen determined to see him to prison in a body . So off they set ; the plaintiff and defendant walking arm in arm , the officer in front , and eight stout coachmen bringing up the rear . At Serjeant ’s Inn Coffee - house the whole party halted to refresh , and , the legal arrangements being completed , the procession moved on again . Some little commotion was occasioned in Fleet Street , by the pleasantry of the eight gentlemen in the flank , who persevered in walking four abreast ; it was also found necessary to leave the mottled - faced gentleman behind , to fight a ticket - porter , it being arranged that his friends should call for him as they came back . Nothing but these little incidents occurred on the way . When they reached the gate of the Fleet , the cavalcade , taking the time from the plaintiff , gave three tremendous cheers for the defendant , and , after having shaken hands all round , left him . Sam , having been formally delivered into the warder ’s custody , to the intense astonishment of Roker , and to the evident emotion of even the phlegmatic Neddy , passed at once into the prison , walked straight to his master ’s room , and knocked at the door . ‘
293902	293918	293647	293647	Sir	9716	’ said Mr. Pickwick . Sam appeared , pulled off his hat , and smiled . ‘
293927	293941	293921	293921	Sam	240	’ said Mr. Pickwick , evidently delighted to see his humble friend again ; ‘

294108	294117	294119	294120	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Oh , if it ’s nothing particular , ’

294205	294218	294198	294198	Sam	240	‘ perhaps I ’d better see arter my bed afore I do anythin ’

294228	294236	294179	294180	Mr. Pickwick	240	’ exclaimed Mr. Pickwick , in astonishment . ‘
294244	294248	294242	294242	Sir	9716	’ replied Sam , ‘
294250	294264	294273	294274	Mr. Pickwick	240	’m a prisoner . I was arrested this here wery arternoon for debt . ’
294265	294271	294273	294274	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ You arrested for debt ! ’

294400	294467	294338	294338	Sir	9716	’ With these words , which he repeated with great emphasis and violence , Sam Weller dashed his hat upon the ground , in a most unusual state of excitement ; and then , folding his arms , looked firmly and fixedly in his master ’s face . CHAPTER LXIV . TREATS OF DIVERS LITTLE MATTERS WHICH OCCURRED IN THE FLEET , AND OF MR . WINKLE ’S

294664	294710	294660	294661	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ the sum is so small that it can very easily be paid ; and having made up my mind that you shall stop with me , you should recollect how much more useful you would be , if you could go outside the walls . ’

294945	294969	294943	294943	Sam	356	’ said Mr. Pickwick , gradually breaking into a smile , in spite of the uneasiness which Sam ’s obstinacy had given him . ‘

294989	294994	294943	294943	Sam	356	’ exclaimed Mr. Weller . ‘

297230	297246	297209	297209	God	299	’ inquired Sam , who was growing sleepy after the numerous events of the day . ‘
297255	297272	297273	297273	He	7704	’ said the cobbler , speaking through his nose in an intense enjoyment of his pipe . ‘

297285	297289	297273	297273	He	7704	’ said Sam . ‘

297354	297358	297360	297360	Sam	356	‘ Wery good , ’
297362	297406	297407	297407	em	7708	‘ And being surrounded by a great number of nieces and nevys , as was always quarrelling and fighting among themselves for the property , he makes me his executor , and leaves the rest to me in trust , to divide it among ‘

297452	297463	297465	297466	the cobbler	14204	‘ It ’s a law term , that ’s all , ’
297468	297475	297477	297477	Sam	356	‘ I do n’t think that , ’

297542	297547	297549	297549	Sam	356	’ What ’s that ? ’
297551	297569	297571	297572	the cobbler	14204	‘ A legal instrument , which is as much as to say , it ’s no go , ’
297574	297578	297580	297580	Sam	356	‘ I see , ’
297582	297592	297580	297580	Sam	356	‘ a sort of brother - in - law o ’
297602	297603	297571	297572	the cobbler	14204	’ ‘
297606	297611	297633	297633	they	7708	’ continued the cobbler , ‘
297782	297797	297814	297814	they	7708	’re lawyers without work ; the only difference being , that , there , they ’re
297873	297976	297872	297872	I	0	’m here for ten thousand , and shall stop here , till I die , mending shoes . Some gentlemen have talked of bringing it before Parliament , and I dare say would have done it , only they had n’t time to come to me , and I had n’t power to go to them , and they got tired of my long letters , and dropped the business . And this is God ’s truth , without one word of suppression or exaggeration , as fifty people , both in this place and out of it , very well know . ’
298078	298082	298127	298128	that worthy	7730	‘ Come in ! ’
298120	298125	298127	298128	that worthy	7730	‘ How are you ? ’
298141	298193	298127	298128	that worthy	7730	‘ I say -- do you expect anybody this morning ? Three men-- devilish gentlemanly fellows -- have been asking after you downstairs , and knocking at every door on the hall flight ; for which they ’ve been most infernally blown up by the collegians that had the trouble of opening ‘
298196	298197	298127	298128	that worthy	7730	’ ‘
298207	298214	298205	298205	them	7731	’ said Mr. Pickwick , rising . ‘
298234	298235	298223	298230	some friends whom I rather expected to see	7732	’ ‘
298240	298251	298259	298259	they	7731	’ exclaimed Smangle , seizing Mr. Pickwick by the hand . ‘
298260	298288	298290	298290	Smangle	682	’re friends of mine from this minute , and friends of Mivins ’s , too . Infernal pleasant , gentlemanly dog , Mivins , is n’t he ? ’
298296	298305	298307	298308	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I know so little of the gentleman , ’
298312	298315	298307	298308	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ that I-- ’
298316	298322	298324	298324	Smangle	682	‘ I know you do , ’
298333	298352	298354	298354	Smangle	682	‘ You shall know him better . You ’ll be delighted with him . That man , Sir , ’
298361	298374	298354	298354	Smangle	682	‘ has comic powers that would do honour to Drury Lane Theatre . ’
298375	298380	298382	298383	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Has he indeed ? ’
298385	298393	298395	298395	Smangle	682	‘ Ah , by Jove he has ! ’
298397	298465	298395	298395	Smangle	682	‘ Hear him come the four cats in the wheel - barrow -- four distinct cats , sir , I pledge you my honour . Now you know that ’s infernal clever ! Damme , you ca n’t help liking a man , when you see these traits about him . He ’s only one fault -- that little failing I mentioned to you , you know . ’
298497	298500	298494	298494	he	240	‘ Ah ! ’
298508	298511	298513	298514	Mr. Smangle	682	‘ Ah ! ’
298523	298582	298513	298514	Mr. Smangle	682	‘ He ’s delightful company , that man is , sir . I do n’t know better company anywhere ; but he has that one drawback . If the ghost of his grandfather , Sir , was to rise before him this minute , he ’d ask him for the loan of his acceptance on an eightpenny stamp . ’
298586	298591	298513	298514	Mr. Smangle	682	’ exclaimed Mr. Pickwick . ‘

298679	298688	298718	298718	he	682	’ said Smangle , making for the door . ‘

298884	298889	298891	298892	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ My dear friends , ’
298916	298924	298905	298906	Mr. Snodgrass	242	‘ I am delighted to see you . ’

298967	298981	298950	298951	Mr. Winkle	276	’ said Sam , entering at the moment with the shoes and gaiters . ‘

299009	299044	299005	299007	This foolish fellow	7741	’ said Mr. Pickwick , tapping Sam on the head as he knelt down to button up his master ’s gaiters--‘this foolish fellow has got himself arrested , in order to be near me . ’
299045	299048	299050	299052	the three friends	11150	‘ What ! ’
299054	299059	299061	299061	Sam	240	‘ Yes , gen’l’m’n , ’

299118	299126	299113	299113	Sam	240	‘ Wot ’s the matter , Sir ? ’
299127	299140	299142	299143	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ I had hoped , Sam , that -- Nothing , nothing , ’

299190	299227	299181	299182	Mr. Tupman	244	‘ He has been much excited for two days past , and his whole demeanour very unlike what it usually is . We feared there must be something the matter , but he resolutely denies it . ’
299228	299233	299235	299236	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ No , no , ’
299245	299297	299240	299241	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ there is really nothing . I assure you there is nothing , my dear sir . It will be necessary for me to leave town , for a short time , on private business , and I had hoped to have prevailed upon you to allow Sam to accompany me . ’
299306	299310	299312	299313	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ I think , ’
299315	299348	299312	299313	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ that Sam would have had no objection to do so ; but , of course , his being a prisoner here , renders it impossible . So I must go alone . ’
299414	299424	299426	299427	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Do you know anything of this , Sam ? ’
299430	299439	299441	299442	Mr. Weller	356	‘ No , I do n’t , sir , ’
299451	299458	299460	299461	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Are you sure , Sam ? ’
299463	299468	299470	299471	Mr. Weller	356	‘ Wy , sir , ’
299473	299475	299470	299471	Mr. Weller	356	‘ I ’m
299486	299502	299504	299504	Sam	356	’ on the subject afore this moment . If I makes any guess about it , ’
299511	299524	299504	299504	Sam	356	‘ I have n’t got any right to say what it is , ‘
299531	299534	299560	299561	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ un . ’
299535	299558	299560	299561	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I have no right to make any further inquiry into the private affairs of a friend , however intimate a friend , ’
299568	299596	299560	299561	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ at present let me merely say , that I do not understand this at all . There . We have had quite enough of the subject . ’
299766	299900	299750	299751	a messenger	7749	’ Commons . The bottle or two , indeed , might be more properly described as a bottle or six , for by the time it was drunk , and tea over , the bell began to ring for strangers to withdraw . But , if Mr. Winkle ’s behaviour had been unaccountable in the morning , it became perfectly unearthly and solemn when , under the influence of his feelings , and his share of the bottle or six , he prepared to take leave of his friend . He lingered behind , until Mr. Tupman and Mr. Snodgrass had disappeared , and then fervently clenched Mr. Pickwick ’s hand , with an expression of face in which deep and mighty resolve was fearfully blended with the very concentrated essence of gloom . ‘
299909	299918	299750	299751	a messenger	7749	’ said Mr. Winkle between his set teeth . ‘
299926	299947	299750	299751	a messenger	7749	’ replied the warm - hearted Mr. Pickwick , as he returned the pressure of his young friend ’s hand . ‘
299951	299959	299750	299751	a messenger	7749	’ cried Mr. Tupman from the gallery . ‘
299966	299971	299750	299751	a messenger	7749	’ replied Mr. Winkle . ‘
299976	299977	299750	299751	a messenger	7749	’ ‘
299982	300030	299750	299751	a messenger	7749	’ said Mr. Pickwick . There was another good - night , and another , and half a dozen more after that , and still Mr. Winkle had fast hold of his friend ’s hand , and was looking into his face with the same strange expression . ‘
300036	300052	299750	299751	a messenger	7749	’ said Mr. Pickwick at last , when his arm was quite sore with shaking . ‘
300055	300060	299750	299751	a messenger	7749	’ said Mr. Winkle . ‘
300068	300079	300080	300081	My friend	9719	’ said Mr. Pickwick , attempting to disengage his hand . ‘
300090	300100	300080	300081	My friend	9719	’ murmured Mr. Winkle , catching at his wrist . ‘
300123	300124	300122	300122	I--	0	’ ‘
300128	300138	300122	300122	I--	0	’ said Mr. Tupman , reappearing at the door . ‘

300161	300210	300157	300157	I	0	’ replied Mr. Winkle . And with a violent effort he tore himself away . As Mr. Pickwick was gazing down the passage after them in silent astonishment , Sam Weller appeared at the stair - head , and whispered for one moment in Mr. Winkle ’s ear . ‘
300219	300225	300157	300157	I	0	’ said that gentleman aloud . ‘

300323	300345	300301	300301	you	9716	’ said Mr. Pickwick , going back into his room , and seating himself at the table in a musing attitude . ‘
300356	300384	300348	300350	that young man	11895	’ He had sat ruminating about the matter for some time , when the voice of Roker , the turnkey , demanded whether he might come in . ‘
300389	300394	300348	300350	that young man	11895	’ said Mr. Pickwick . ‘
300405	300410	300403	300403	Sir	9716	’ said Mr. Roker , ‘

300522	300527	300528	300528	He	16189	’ exclaimed Mr. Pickwick . ‘
300540	300567	300538	300538	Sir	9716	’ replied Roker , turning his hat round , so as to get the maker ’s name right side upwards , as he looked into it . ‘
300575	300580	300568	300568	You	9716	’ said Mr. Pickwick . ‘

PICKWICK MAKES A TOUR OF THE DIMINUTIVE WORLD HE INHABITS , AND RESOLVES TO MIX WITH IT , IN FUTURE , AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE A few mornings after his incarceration , Mr. Samuel Weller , having arranged his master ’s room with all possible care , and seen him comfortably seated over his books and papers , withdrew to employ himself for an hour or two to come , as he best could . It was a fine morning , and it occurred to Sam that a pint of porter in the open air would lighten his next quarter of an hour or so , as well as any little amusement in which he could indulge . Having arrived at this conclusion , he betook himself to the tap . Having purchased the beer , and obtained , moreover , the day - but - one - before- yesterday ’s paper , he repaired to the skittle - ground , and seating himself on a bench , proceeded to enjoy himself in a very sedate and methodical manner . First of all , he took a refreshing draught of the beer , and then he looked up at a window , and bestowed a platonic wink on a young lady who was peeling potatoes thereat . Then he opened the paper , and folded it so as to get the police reports outwards ; and this being a vexatious and difficult thing to do , when there is any wind stirring , he took another draught of the beer when he had accomplished it . Then , he read two lines of the paper , and stopped short to look at a couple of men who were finishing a game at rackets , which , being concluded , he cried out ‘
301838	302008	302009	302009	Weller	356	’ in an approving manner , and looked round upon the spectators , to ascertain whether their sentiments coincided with his own . This involved the necessity of looking up at the windows also ; and as the young lady was still there , it was an act of common politeness to wink again , and to drink to her good health in dumb show , in another draught of the beer , which Sam did ; and having frowned hideously upon a small boy who had noted this latter proceeding with open eyes , he threw one leg over the other , and , holding the newspaper in both hands , began to read in real earnest . He had hardly composed himself into the needful state of abstraction , when he thought he heard his own name proclaimed in some distant passage . Nor was he mistaken , for it quickly passed from mouth to mouth , and in a few seconds the air teemed with shouts of ‘
302011	302014	302016	302016	Sam	356	’ Here ! ’
302023	302046	302016	302016	Sam	356	‘ Wot ’s the matter ? Who wants him ? Has an express come to say that his country house is afire ? ’
302047	302055	302057	302062	a man who was standing by	7805	‘ Somebody wants you in the hall , ’
302064	302068	302057	302062	a man who was standing by	7805	‘ Just mind that ‘
302081	302085	302086	302086	I	0	’ said Sam . ‘

302227	302243	302206	302206	his	7811	’ said Sam impetuously , when the old gentleman had discharged himself of another shout ; ‘

302268	302274	302206	302206	his	7811	’ replied the old gentleman , ‘

302353	302362	302351	302351	Sammy	356	’ said the elder Mr. Weller , rising . ‘

302446	302452	302454	302454	Sam	356	‘ Keep quiet , do , ’

302579	302605	302577	302577	Pell	689	’ said Sam . Mr. Weller shook his head , and his red cheeks expanded with the laughter that was endeavouring to find a vent . ‘
302613	302624	302606	302609	Mottled - faced man	7819	’ asked Sam . Again Mr. Weller shook his head . ‘

302732	302747	302749	302750	Mr. Weller	493	‘ They ’ve come to have a little serious talk with you , Samivel , ’
302756	302769	302749	302750	Mr. Weller	493	‘ Do n’t let out nothin’ about the unnat’ral creditor , Sammy . ’
302770	302781	302783	302783	Sam	356	‘ Wot , do n’t they know who it is ? ’
302785	302792	302794	302795	his father	1717	‘ Not a bit on it , ’

302866	302886	302864	302864	Sammy	356	’ said Mr. Weller , when he felt himself equal to the task of speaking in an articulate manner . ‘

302959	302970	302992	302993	his father	1717	’ our door for him , to get up by . ’
302971	302978	302980	302980	Sam	356	‘ You do n’t mean that ? ’

303024	303080	302992	302993	his father	1717	’ being precipitayted down full six foot , and dashed into a million hatoms . He tumbled in at last , however , and avay ve vent ; and I rayther think -- I say I rayther think , Samivel -- that he found his - self a little jolted ven ve turned the corners . ’
303081	303097	303099	303099	Sam	356	‘ Wot , I s’pose you happened to drive up agin a post or two ? ’
303101	303103	303099	303099	Sam	356	‘ I ’m

303145	303197	302992	302993	his father	1717	’ Here the old gentleman shook his head from side to side , and was seized with a hoarse internal rumbling , accompanied with a violent swelling of the countenance , and a sudden increase in the breadth of all his features ; symptoms which alarmed his son not a little . ‘
303210	303237	303203	303203	Sammy	356	’ said the old gentleman , when by dint of much struggling , and various convulsive stamps upon the ground , he had recovered his voice . ‘

303460	303469	303470	303470	wery	7829	’ said Sam , politely saluting the lady , ‘

304205	304249	304203	304203	mum	7830	’ The worthy lady looked at Mr. Stiggins for a reply ; that gentleman , with many rollings of the eye , clenched his throat with his right hand , and mimicked the act of swallowing , to intimate that he was athirst . ‘

304387	304425	304436	304436	Sam	356	’ said Mr. Stiggins--‘if there is any one of them less odious than another , it is the liquor called rum . Warm , my dear young friend , with three lumps of sugar to the tumbler . ’
304426	304434	304436	304436	Sam	356	‘ Wery sorry to say , sir , ’
304438	304455	304436	304436	Sam	356	‘ that they do n’t allow that particular wanity to be sold in this here establishment . ’
304456	304468	304470	304471	Mr. Stiggins	539	‘ Oh , the hardness of heart of these inveterate men ! ’
304473	304484	304470	304471	Mr. Stiggins	539	‘ Oh , the accursed cruelty of these inhuman persecutors ! ’
304627	304632	304634	304635	the gentleman	883	‘ Well , Sammy , ’
304637	304656	304634	304635	the gentleman	883	‘ I hope you ’ll find your spirits rose by this here lively wisit . Wery cheerful and improvin ’

304676	304687	304674	304674	Sam	356	‘ and I desire you wo n’t address no more o ’
304694	304845	304688	304688	them	7863	’ So far from being edified by this very proper reply , the elder Mr. Weller at once relapsed into a broad grin ; and this inexorable conduct causing the lady and Mr. Stiggins to close their eyes , and rock themselves to and fro on their chairs , in a troubled manner , he furthermore indulged in several acts of pantomime , indicative of a desire to pummel and wring the nose of the aforesaid Stiggins , the performance of which , appeared to afford him great mental relief . The old gentleman very narrowly escaped detection in one instance ; for Mr. Stiggins happening to give a start on the arrival of the negus , brought his head in smart contact with the clenched fist with which Mr. Weller had been describing imaginary fireworks in the air , within two inches of his ear , for some minutes . ‘
304852	304862	304688	304688	them	7863	’ out , your hand for the tumbler in that ‘
304868	304876	304848	304848	you	7864	’ said Sam , with great promptitude . ‘
304887	304888	304879	304879	you	7864	’ ‘
304899	304917	304897	304897	Sammy	356	’ said Mr. Weller , in some degree abashed by the very unexpected occurrence of the incident . ‘
304925	304943	304923	304923	sir	9716	’ said Sam , as the red - nosed gentleman rubbed his head with a rueful visage . ‘
304949	304956	304897	304897	Sammy	356	’ that , for a go o ’
304963	305199	304961	304961	Sir	9716	’ Mr. Stiggins made no verbal answer , but his manner was expressive . He tasted the contents of the glass which Sam had placed in his hand , put his umbrella on the floor , and tasted it again , passing his hand placidly across his stomach twice or thrice ; he then drank the whole at a breath , and smacking his lips , held out the tumbler for more . Nor was Mrs. Weller behind - hand in doing justice to the composition . The good lady began by protesting that she could n’t touch a drop -- then took a small drop -- then a large drop -- then a great many drops ; and her feelings being of the nature of those substances which are powerfully affected by the application of strong waters , she dropped a tear with every drop of negus , and so got on , melting the feelings down , until at length she had arrived at a very pathetic and decent pitch of misery . The elder Mr. Weller observed these signs and tokens with many manifestations of disgust , and when , after a second jug of the same , Mr. Stiggins began to sigh in a dismal manner , he plainly evinced his disapprobation of the whole proceedings , by sundry incoherent ramblings of speech , among which frequent angry repetitions of the word ‘

305223	305247	305218	305218	Samivel	493	’ whispered the old gentleman into his son ’s ear , after a long and steadfast contemplation of his lady and Mr. Stiggins ; ‘
305270	305277	305218	305218	Samivel	493	’ the red - nosed man . ’
305278	305284	305286	305286	Sam	356	‘ Wot do you mean ? ’
305288	305296	305298	305300	the old gentleman	10238	‘ I mean this here , Sammy , ’
305302	305314	305298	305300	the old gentleman	10238	‘ that wot they drink , do n’t seem no nourishment to ‘

305895	305906	305908	305909	Mrs. Weller	487	‘ I hope it may do you good , Samuel , ’
305912	305920	305922	305922	Sam	356	‘ I think it vill , mum , ’
305924	305938	305940	305941	Mrs. Weller	487	‘ I wish I could hope that it would do your father good , ’
305943	305949	305951	305952	Mr. Weller	356	‘ Thank’ee , my dear , ’
305956	305968	305954	305954	senior	12514	‘ How do you find yourself arter it , my love ? ’
305969	305972	305974	305975	Mrs. Weller	487	‘ Scoffer ! ’
305977	305981	305983	305986	the Reverend Mr. Stiggins	539	‘ Benighted man ! ’
305988	305999	305983	305986	the Reverend Mr. Stiggins	539	‘ If I do n’t get no better light than that ‘

306089	306137	306142	306142	Samivel	493	’ At this supposition , the Reverend Mr. Stiggins , in evident consternation , gathered up his hat and umbrella , and proposed an immediate departure , to which Mrs. Weller assented . Sam walked with them to the lodge gate , and took a dutiful leave . ‘
306144	306150	306142	306142	Samivel	493	’ said the old gentleman . ‘
306157	306161	306142	306142	Samivel	493	’ inquired Sammy . ‘
306170	306176	306142	306142	Samivel	493	’ said the old gentleman . ‘

306204	306213	306142	306142	Samivel	493	’ whispered Mr. Weller , looking cautiously round ; ‘

306264	306290	306261	306262	a pianner	7893	’ said Mr. Weller , striking his son on the chest with the back of his hand , and falling back a step or two . ‘
306296	306300	306293	306293	you	7891	’ said Sam . ‘
306308	306320	306322	306322	he	16313	’ rejoined Mr. Weller , in a still more mysterious manner , ‘
306335	306336	306333	306333	Sammy	356	’ ‘
306339	306345	306333	306333	Sammy	356	‘ ud be the good o ’

306388	306392	306354	306354	him	16313	’ rejoined Sam . ‘
306401	306406	306354	306354	him	16313	’ whispered his father . ‘

306605	306608	306610	306611	that gentleman	9760	‘ Sam , ’
306613	306616	306618	306619	Mr. Weller	356	‘ Sir , ’
306621	306652	306654	306655	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I am going for a walk round the prison , and I wish you to attend me . I see a prisoner we know coming this way , Sam , ’
306659	306664	306666	306667	Mr. Weller	356	‘ Wich , Sir ? ’
306669	306676	306666	306667	Mr. Weller	356	‘ the gen’l’m’n vith the head o ’
306682	306689	306695	306696	Mr. Pickwick	240	’ captive in the stockin ’s ? ’
306690	306693	306695	306696	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Neither , ’
306698	306709	306695	306696	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ He is an older friend of yours , Sam . ’
306710	306712	306695	306696	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ O ’
306717	306722	306715	306715	Sir	9716	’ exclaimed Mr. Weller . ‘
306736	306741	306734	306734	Sam	356	’ replied Mr. Pickwick , ‘
306774	306990	306771	306771	he	883	’ As Mr. Pickwick spoke , Jingle walked up . He looked less miserable than before , being clad in a half - worn suit of clothes , which , with Mr. Pickwick ’s assistance , had been released from the pawnbroker ’s . He wore clean linen too , and had had his hair cut . He was very pale and thin , however ; and as he crept slowly up , leaning on a stick , it was easy to see that he had suffered severely from illness and want , and was still very weak . He took off his hat as Mr. Pickwick saluted him , and seemed much humbled and abashed at the sight of Sam Weller . Following close at his heels , came Mr. Job Trotter , in the catalogue of whose vices , want of faith and attachment to his companion could at all events find no place . He was still ragged and squalid , but his face was not quite so hollow as on his first meeting with Mr. Pickwick , a few days before . As he took off his hat to our benevolent old friend , he murmured some broken expressions of gratitude , and muttered something about having been saved from starving . ‘
306995	307004	307005	307005	you	7905	’ said Mr. Pickwick , impatiently interrupting him , ‘
307028	307029	307032	307032	sir	9716	’ ‘
307058	307059	307032	307032	sir	9716	’ ‘
307067	307072	307032	307032	sir	9716	’ said Mr. Pickwick . ‘
307077	307081	307032	307032	sir	9716	’ replied Jingle ; ‘
307089	307090	307032	307032	sir	9716	’ ‘
307093	307098	307032	307032	sir	9716	’ said Mr. Pickwick ; ‘
307108	307202	307106	307106	Sir	9716	’ Seeing that he was confused and agitated , and uncertain what to do , Mr. Pickwick cut the matter short by drawing the invalided stroller ’s arm through his , and leading him away , without saying another word about it . During the whole of this time the countenance of Mr. Samuel Weller had exhibited an expression of the most overwhelming and absorbing astonishment that the imagination can portray . After looking from Job to Jingle , and from Jingle to Job in profound silence , he softly ejaculated the words , ‘
307211	307255	307205	307205	I	0	’ which he repeated at least a score of times ; after which exertion , he appeared wholly bereft of speech , and again cast his eyes , first upon the one and then upon the other , in mute perplexity and bewilderment . ‘
307260	307268	307269	307269	I	0	’ said Mr. Pickwick , looking back . ‘
307270	307274	307276	307276	sir	9716	’m a - comin ’
307278	307369	307276	307276	sir	9716	’ replied Mr. Weller , mechanically following his master ; and still he lifted not his eyes from Mr. Job Trotter , who walked at his side in silence . Job kept his eyes fixed on the ground for some time . Sam , with his glued to Job ’s countenance , ran up against the people who were walking about , and fell over little children , and stumbled against steps and railings , without appearing at all sensible of it , until Job , looking stealthily up , said-- ‘
307378	307379	307372	307372	you	0	’ ‘
307386	307416	307384	307384	him	7909	’ exclaimed Sam ; and having established Job ’s identity beyond all doubt , he smote his leg , and vented his feelings in a long , shrill whistle . ‘
307425	307429	307423	307423	sir	9716	’ said Job . ‘
307436	307450	307423	307423	sir	9716	’ exclaimed Mr. Weller , surveying his companion ’s rags with undisguised wonder . ‘
307478	307489	307423	307423	sir	9716	’ pocket - pieces for a good half - crown . ’
307490	307495	307497	307497	Job	419	‘ It is indeed , ’
307503	307515	307517	307517	Job	419	‘ There is no deception now , Mr. Weller . Tears , ’
307525	307540	307517	307517	Job	419	‘ tears are not the only proofs of distress , nor the best ones . ’
307541	307548	307550	307550	Sam	356	‘ No , they ai n’t , ’
307553	307563	307565	307565	Job	419	‘ They may be put on , Mr. Weller , ’
307567	307573	307575	307575	Sam	356	‘ I know they may , ’
307577	307584	307517	307517	Job	419	‘ some people , indeed , has ‘
307601	307602	307598	307598	they	7913	’ ‘
307605	307609	307598	307598	they	7913	’ replied Job ; ‘
307636	307689	307621	307622	Mr. Weller	356	’ As he spoke , he pointed to his sallow , sunken cheeks , and , drawing up his coat sleeve , disclosed an arm which looked as if the bone could be broken at a touch , so sharp and brittle did it appear , beneath its thin covering of flesh . ‘
307700	307706	307692	307692	you	419	’ said Sam , recoiling . ‘
307709	307713	307692	307692	you	419	’ replied Job . ‘
307716	307720	307721	307721	I	0	’ echoed Sam . ‘
307731	307743	307744	307744	Sam	356	’ said Job ; and eating and drinking almost as little . ’
307776	307785	307787	307787	Job	419	‘ Where are you going , Mr. Weller ? ’
307800	307804	307806	307806	Sam	356	‘ Come on , ’
307808	307812	307806	307806	Sam	356	‘ come on ! ’
307838	307841	307843	307843	Sam	356	‘ Now , ’
307845	307874	307843	307843	Sam	356	‘ drink that up , ev’ry drop on it , and then turn the pot upside down , to let me see as you ’ve took the medicine . ’
307875	307883	307885	307885	Job	419	‘ But , my dear Mr. Weller , ’
307887	307892	307894	307894	Sam	356	‘ Down vith it ! ’
307991	307995	307997	307997	Sam	356	‘ Well done ! ’
307999	308008	307997	307997	Sam	356	‘ How do you find yourself arter it ? ’
308009	308020	308022	308022	Job	419	‘ Better , Sir . I think I am better , ’
308024	308026	308028	308028	you	7916	‘ O ’
308031	308036	308028	308028	you	7916	’ said Sam argumentatively . ‘
308041	308069	307997	307997	Sam	356	’ gas in a balloon . I can see with the naked eye that you gets stouter under the operation . Wot do you say to another o ’

308090	308096	308088	308088	Sir	9716	’ replied Job--‘much rather not . ’
308097	308110	308112	308112	Sam	356	‘ Vell , then , wot do you say to some wittles ? ’
308114	308123	308125	308126	Mr. Trotter	419	‘ Thanks to your worthy governor , Sir , ’
308128	308154	308125	308126	Mr. Trotter	419	‘ we have half a leg of mutton , baked , at a quarter before three , with the potatoes under it to save boiling . ’

308170	308175	308176	308176	He	419	’ asked Sam emphatically . ‘
308181	308185	308176	308176	He	419	’ replied Job . ‘
308237	308251	308234	308235	Mr. Weller	356	’ said Job , with real tears in his eyes , for once , ‘
308266	308267	308268	308268	I	0	’ ‘
308271	308275	308268	308268	I	0	’ said Sam , ‘

308295	308298	308290	308291	Job Trotter	419	‘ None o ’
308307	308312	308301	308301	I	0	’ repeated Sam firmly . ‘

308348	308389	308342	308342	he	356	‘ I never heerd , mind you , or read of in story - books , nor see in picters , any angel in tights and gaiters -- not even in spectacles , as I remember , though that may ha ’
308394	308436	308342	308342	he	356	’ I know to the contrairey -- but mark my vords , Job Trotter , he ’s a reg’lar thoroughbred angel for all that ; and let me see the man as wenturs to tell me he knows a better vun . ’
308525	308528	308530	308531	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Well , ’
308541	308605	308530	308531	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ you will see how your health becomes , and think about it meanwhile . Make the statement out for me when you feel yourself equal to the task , and I will discuss the subject with you when I have considered it . Now , go to your room . You are tired , and not strong enough to be out long . ’
308661	308672	308674	308675	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Curious scene this , is it not , Sam ? ’
308682	308689	308691	308691	Sam	240	‘ Wery much so , Sir , ’
308693	308695	308691	308691	Sam	240	‘ Wonders ‘
308700	308708	308709	308709	I	0	’ added Sam , speaking to himself . ‘
308710	308716	308709	308709	I	0	’m wery much mistaken if that ‘
308731	308836	308709	308709	I	0	’ The area formed by the wall in that part of the Fleet in which Mr. Pickwick stood was just wide enough to make a good racket - court ; one side being formed , of course , by the wall itself , and the other by that portion of the prison which looked ( or rather would have looked , but for the wall ) towards St. Paul ’s Cathedral . Sauntering or sitting about , in every possible attitude of listless idleness , were a great number of debtors , the major part of whom were waiting in prison until their day of ‘
308839	309125	309197	309197	Job	419	’ before the Insolvent Court should arrive ; while others had been remanded for various terms , which they were idling away as they best could . Some were shabby , some were smart , many dirty , a few clean ; but there they all lounged , and loitered , and slunk about with as little spirit or purpose as the beasts in a menagerie . Lolling from the windows which commanded a view of this promenade were a number of persons , some in noisy conversation with their acquaintance below , others playing at ball with some adventurous throwers outside , others looking on at the racket - players , or watching the boys as they cried the game . Dirty , slipshod women passed and repassed , on their way to the cooking - house in one corner of the yard ; children screamed , and fought , and played together , in another ; the tumbling of the skittles , and the shouts of the players , mingled perpetually with these and a hundred other sounds ; and all was noise and tumult -- save in a little miserable shed a few yards off , where lay , all quiet and ghastly , the body of the Chancery prisoner who had died the night before , awaiting the mockery of an inquest . The body ! It is the lawyer ’s term for the restless , whirling mass of cares and anxieties , affections , hopes , and griefs , that make up the living man . The law had his body ; and there it lay , clothed in grave - clothes , an awful witness to its tender mercy . ‘
309138	309143	309136	309136	Sir	9716	’ inquired Job Trotter . ‘
309149	309157	309146	309146	you	7935	’ was Mr. Pickwick ’s counter inquiry . ‘

309199	309213	309197	309197	Job	419	‘ a whistling - shop , Sir , is where they sell spirits . ’
309235	309286	309197	309197	Job	419	’ prisons , and such commodities being highly prized by the ladies and gentlemen confined therein , it had occurred to some speculative turnkey to connive , for certain lucrative considerations , at two or three prisoners retailing the favourite article of gin , for their own profit and advantage . ‘
309306	309311	309293	309293	Sir	9716	’ said Mr. Trotter . ‘
309320	309324	309326	309327	the turnkeys	7154	’ said Sam , ‘

309358	309383	309393	309393	Job	419	’re applauded for their wigilance ; so it cuts two ways -- frightens other people from the trade , and elewates their own characters . ’
309384	309391	309393	309393	Job	419	‘ Exactly so , Mr. Weller , ’
309395	309414	309416	309417	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Well , but are these rooms never searched to ascertain whether any spirits are concealed in them ? ’
309419	309426	309428	309428	Sam	240	‘ Cert’nly they are , Sir , ’
309430	309457	309428	309428	Sam	240	‘ but the turnkeys knows beforehand , and gives the word to the wistlers , and you may wistle for it wen you go to look . ’

310116	310128	310130	310132	the heavy gentleman	7972	‘ Stop at the house with a green door , driver , ’
310134	310141	310143	310147	one of the vixenish ladies	7977	‘ Oh ! You perwerse creetur ! ’
310149	310153	310143	310147	one of the vixenish ladies	7977	‘ Drive to the ‘
310162	310217	310143	310147	one of the vixenish ladies	7977	’ Upon this the cabman , who in a sudden effort to pull up at the house with the green door , had pulled the horse up so high that he nearly pulled him backward into the cabriolet , let the animal ’s fore - legs down to the ground again , and paused . ‘
310226	310231	310235	310235	yourselves	7980	’ inquired the driver . ‘
310244	310287	310238	310238	I	0	’ Here the contest was renewed with increased violence ; and the horse being troubled with a fly on his nose , the cabman humanely employed his leisure in lashing him about on the head , on the counter - irritation principle . ‘
310294	310304	310143	310147	one of the vixenish ladies	7977	’ said one of the vixenish ladies at length . ‘
310306	310315	310343	310345	the vixenish ladies	7970	‘ ouse with the yellow door , cabman . ’

310349	310364	310318	310319	the cabriolet	16701	‘ acterrally more noise than if one had come in one ’s own carriage , ’

310523	310538	310521	310521	Raddle	573	’ said the other little woman , who was no other than Mrs. Cluppins . ‘

310580	310724	310563	310563	you	0	’ said Mrs. Raddle . While this dialogue was going on , the driver was most ignominiously leading the horse , by the bridle , up to the house with the red door , which Master Bardell had already opened . Here was a mean and low way of arriving at a friend ’s house ! No dashing up , with all the fire and fury of the animal ; no jumping down of the driver ; no loud knocking at the door ; no opening of the apron with a crash at the very last moment , for fear of the ladies sitting in a draught ; and then the man handing the shawls out , afterwards , as if he were a private coachman ! The whole edge of the thing had been taken off -- it was flatter than walking . ‘
310729	310734	310727	310727	Tommy	370	’ said Mrs. Cluppins , ‘

310798	310808	310810	310811	Mrs. Cluppins	532	‘ Is anybody else a - goin’ , Tommy ? ’

310869	310874	310861	310861	Tommy	370	’ said Master Bardell . ‘
310884	310894	310897	310898	Mrs. Rogers	711	’ said Mrs. Cluppins , in an insinuating manner . ‘
310904	310920	310897	310898	Mrs. Rogers	711	’ replied Master Bardell , opening his eyes very wide as he delivered the intelligence . ‘
310931	310969	310923	310925	The lady as	8003	’ ejaculated Mrs. Cluppins . Master Bardell put his hands deeper down into his pockets , and nodded exactly thirty - five times , to imply that it was the lady - lodger , and no other . ‘
310973	310978	310923	310925	The lady as	8003	’ said Mrs. Cluppins . ‘

311003	311008	310998	310998	you	8005	’ replied Master Bardell . ‘
311015	311021	311013	311013	Tommy	370	’ said Mrs. Cluppins coaxingly . ‘
311034	311041	311043	311044	Master Bardell	370	’ No , I wo n’t , ’
311059	311064	311066	311067	Mrs. Cluppins	532	‘ Drat the child ! ’

311182	311193	311195	311196	Mrs. Cluppins	532	‘ Lauk , Mary Ann ! what ’s the matter ? ’
311198	311212	311214	311215	Mrs. Raddle	573	‘ It ’s put me all over in such a tremble , Betsy , ’
311217	311231	311214	311215	Mrs. Raddle	573	‘ Raddle ai n’t like a man ; he leaves everythink to me . ’
311427	311433	311435	311436	Mrs. Rogers	711	‘ Ah , poor thing ! ’
311438	311450	311435	311436	Mrs. Rogers	711	‘ I know what her feelin ’s is , too well . ’
311460	311514	311458	311458	I	0	’ said Mrs. Sanders ; and then all the ladies moaned in unison , and said they knew what it was , and they pitied her from their hearts , they did . Even the lodger ’s little servant , who was thirteen years old and three feet high , murmured her sympathy . ‘
311522	311527	311535	311535	ma’am	10369	’ said Mrs. Bardell . ‘
311537	311542	311535	311535	ma’am	10369	’ inquired Mrs. Rogers . ‘
311551	311571	311543	311543	I	0	’ replied Mrs. Raddle , in a reproachful manner . Thereupon the ladies cast indignant glances at Mr. Raddle . ‘
311578	311587	311543	311543	I	0	’ said that unhappy gentleman , stepping forward , ‘
311604	311625	311626	311626	You	8026	’ A loud scream from his wife , at the mention of this word , rendered all further explanation inaudible . ‘
311638	311643	311636	311636	Raddle	573	’ said Mrs. Cluppins . ‘
311653	311656	311657	311659	All the ladies	5415	’re here . ’
311806	311814	311816	311817	Mrs. Bardell	369	‘ Why , Mrs. Rogers , ma’am , ’
311819	311844	311816	311817	Mrs. Bardell	369	‘ you ’ve never been introduced , I declare ! Mr. Raddle , ma’am ; Mrs. Cluppins , ma’am ; Mrs. Raddle , ma’am . ’
311845	311853	311855	311856	Mrs. Sanders	533	‘ Which is Mrs. Cluppins ’s sister , ’
311858	311863	311865	311866	Mrs. Rogers	711	‘ Oh , indeed ! ’
311896	311901	311902	311903	Mrs. Raddle	573	‘ Oh , indeed ! ’
311916	311948	311912	311913	Mrs. Cluppins	532	‘ she was sure she was very happy to have an opportunity of being known to a lady which she had heerd so much in favour of , as Mrs. Rogers . ’

312512	312522	312509	312510	Mrs. Rogers	711	‘ I almost wish I lived in it always . ’
312523	312534	312536	312537	Mrs. Bardell	369	‘ Oh , you would n’t like that , ma’am , ’
312561	312570	312509	312510	Mrs. Rogers	711	‘ you would n’t like it , ma’am . ’
312571	312596	312598	312600	little Mrs. Cluppins	532	‘ Oh ! I should think you was a deal too lively and sought after , to be content with the country , ma’am , ’

312621	312655	312657	312658	Mr. Raddle	575	‘ For lone people as have got nobody to care for them , or take care of them , or as have been hurt in their mind , or that kind of thing , ’

313358	313365	313367	313368	Mr. Jackson	464	‘ I called in Goswell Street , ’
313370	313402	313367	313368	Mr. Jackson	464	‘ and hearing that you were here , from the slavey , took a coach and came on . Our people want you down in the city directly , Mrs. Bardell . ’

313432	313478	313425	313426	Mr. Jackson	464	‘ It ’s very important and pressing business , which ca n’t be postponed on any account . Indeed , Dodson expressly said so to me , and so did Fogg . I ’ve kept the coach on purpose for you to go back in . ’
313479	313484	313486	313487	Mrs. Bardell	369	‘ How very strange ! ’
313625	313639	313641	313642	Mrs. Bardell	369	‘ But wo n’t you refresh yourself after your walk , Mr. Jackson ? ’
313645	313657	313659	313659	Jackson	464	‘ Why , really there ai n’t much time to lose , ’

313775	313886	313887	313887	Isaac	714	’ Mr. Jackson ’s fingers wandered playfully round his nose at this portion of his discourse , to warn his hearers that he was speaking ironically . The waiter was at once despatched to the bashful gentleman , and the bashful gentleman took something ; Mr. Jackson also took something , and the ladies took something , for hospitality ’s sake . Mr. Jackson then said he was afraid it was time to go ; upon which , Mrs. Sanders , Mrs. Cluppins , and Tommy ( who it was arranged should accompany Mrs. Bardell , leaving the others to Mr. Raddle ’s protection ) , got into the coach . ‘
313889	313922	313887	313887	Isaac	714	’ said Jackson , as Mrs. Bardell prepared to get in , looking up at the man with the ash stick , who was seated on the box , smoking a cigar . ‘

314447	314451	314453	314453	Jackson	464	‘ Just this , ’
314463	314565	314453	314453	Jackson	464	‘ do n’t be frightened , Mrs. Bardell . There never was a more delicate man than Dodson , ma’am , or a more humane man than Fogg . It was their duty in the way of business , to take you in execution for them costs ; but they were anxious to spare your feelings as much as they could . What a comfort it must be , to you , to think how it ’s been done ! This is the Fleet , ma’am . Wish you good - night , Mrs. Bardell . Good - night , Tommy ! ’

314731	314736	314738	314739	the man	835	‘ Dodson and Fogg , ’

314767	314800	314760	314760	Sam	356	‘ Run to Mr. Perker ’s , Job . I want him directly . I see some good in this . Here ’s a game . Hooray ! vere ’s the gov’nor ? ’
314865	315083	314862	314864	MR . PICKWICK	240	’S BENEVOLENCE PROVES STRONGER THAN HIS OBSTINACY Job Trotter , abating nothing of his speed , ran up Holborn , sometimes in the middle of the road , sometimes on the pavement , sometimes in the gutter , as the chances of getting along varied with the press of men , women , children , and coaches , in each division of the thoroughfare , and , regardless of all obstacles stopped not for an instant until he reached the gate of Gray ’s Inn . Notwithstanding all the expedition he had used , however , the gate had been closed a good half - hour when he reached it , and by the time he had discovered Mr. Perker ’s laundress , who lived with a married daughter , who had bestowed her hand upon a non - resident waiter , who occupied the one - pair of some number in some street closely adjoining to some brewery somewhere behind Gray ’s Inn Lane , it was within fifteen minutes of closing the prison for the night . Mr. Lowten had still to be ferreted out from the back parlour of the Magpie and Stump ; and Job had scarcely accomplished this object , and communicated Sam Weller ’s message , when the clock struck ten . ‘
315086	315090	314862	314864	MR . PICKWICK	240	’ said Lowten , ‘
315118	315119	315115	315116	my friend	9719	’ ‘
315124	315128	315115	315116	my friend	9719	’ replied Job . ‘
315162	315163	315142	315143	Mr. Perker	362	’ ‘
315166	315175	315142	315143	Mr. Perker	362	’ responded Lowten , after a little consideration , ‘
315223	315525	315571	315571	Sir	9716	’ Deciding on this line of conduct , Mr. Lowten took up his hat , and begging the assembled company to appoint a deputy - chairman during his temporary absence , led the way to the nearest coach - stand . Summoning the cab of most promising appearance , he directed the driver to repair to Montague Place , Russell Square . Mr. Perker had had a dinner - party that day , as was testified by the appearance of lights in the drawing - room windows , the sound of an improved grand piano , and an improvable cabinet voice issuing therefrom , and a rather overpowering smell of meat which pervaded the steps and entry . In fact , a couple of very good country agencies happening to come up to town , at the same time , an agreeable little party had been got together to meet them , comprising Mr. Snicks , the Life Office Secretary , Mr. Prosee , the eminent counsel , three solicitors , one commissioner of bankrupts , a special pleader from the Temple , a small - eyed peremptory young gentleman , his pupil , who had written a lively book about the law of demises , with a vast quantity of marginal notes and references ; and several other eminent and distinguished personages . From this society , little Mr. Perker detached himself , on his clerk being announced in a whisper ; and repairing to the dining - room , there found Mr. Lowten and Job Trotter looking very dim and shadowy by the light of a kitchen candle , which the gentleman who condescended to appear in plush shorts and cottons for a quarterly stipend , had , with a becoming contempt for the clerk and all things appertaining to ‘
315529	315535	315571	315571	Sir	9716	’ placed upon the table . ‘
315540	315550	315538	315538	Lowten	473	’ said little Mr. Perker , shutting the door , ‘
315567	315568	315571	315571	Sir	9716	’ ‘
315573	315577	315571	315571	Sir	9716	’ replied Lowten . ‘
315588	315589	315583	315584	Mr. Pickwick	240	’ ‘
315595	315606	315591	315591	Pickwick	240	’ said the little man , turning quickly to Job . ‘
315613	315614	315591	315591	Pickwick	240	’ ‘
315630	315634	315628	315628	Sir	9716	’ said Job . ‘
315637	315654	315628	315628	Sir	9716	’ exclaimed Perker , putting his hands in his pockets , and reclining against the sideboard . ‘
315657	315661	315628	315628	Sir	9716	’ said Job . ‘
315676	315684	315664	315664	they	8113	‘ em , directly after the trial . ’
315685	315689	315691	315691	Perker	362	‘ By Jove ! ’
315717	315731	315691	315691	Perker	362	‘ those are the cleverest scamps I ever had anything to do with ! ’
315732	315742	315744	315744	Lowten	473	‘ The sharpest practitioners I ever knew , Sir , ’
315746	315749	315751	315751	Perker	362	‘ Sharp ! ’
315753	315763	315751	315751	Perker	362	‘ There ’s no knowing where to have them . ’
315764	315774	315776	315776	Lowten	473	‘ Very true , Sir , there is not , ’
315854	315864	315866	315868	the little man	2005	‘ At ten precisely , I will be there , ’
315870	315890	315866	315868	the little man	2005	‘ Sam is quite right . Tell him so . Will you take a glass of wine , Lowten ? ’
315898	315899	315894	315894	you	362	’ ‘
315907	316101	315904	315904	I	0	’ said the little man , turning to the sideboard for a decanter and glasses . As Lowten _ did _ mean yes , he said no more on the subject , but inquired of Job , in an audible whisper , whether the portrait of Perker , which hung opposite the fireplace , was n’t a wonderful likeness , to which Job of course replied that it was . The wine being by this time poured out , Lowten drank to Mrs. Perker and the children , and Job to Perker . The gentleman in the plush shorts and cottons considering it no part of his duty to show the people from the office out , consistently declined to answer the bell , and they showed themselves out . The attorney betook himself to his drawing - room , the clerk to the Magpie and Stump , and Job to Covent Garden Market to spend the night in a vegetable basket . Punctually at the appointed hour next morning , the good - humoured little attorney tapped at Mr. Pickwick ’s door , which was opened with great alacrity by Sam Weller . ‘
316107	316129	316102	316103	Mr. Perker	362	’ said Sam , announcing the visitor to Mr. Pickwick , who was sitting at the window in a thoughtful attitude . ‘
316158	316195	316156	316156	Sir	9716	’ Perker bestowed a look of intelligence on Sam , intimating that he understood he was not to say he had been sent for ; and beckoning him to approach , whispered briefly in his ear . ‘
316201	316206	316208	316208	Sam	240	‘ ere , Sir ? ’
316267	316273	316275	316276	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ What does this mean ? ’
316284	316294	316275	316276	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ What has put Sam into this extraordinary state ? ’
316295	316302	316304	316304	Perker	362	‘ Oh , nothing , nothing , ’
316306	316331	316304	316304	Perker	362	‘ Come , my dear Sir , draw up your chair to the table . I have a good deal to say to you . ’
316332	316338	316340	316341	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ What papers are those ? ’
316361	316369	316371	316371	Perker	362	‘ The papers in Bardell and Pickwick , ’
316418	316431	316433	316435	the little man	2005	‘ You do n’t like to hear the name of the cause ? ’
316444	316452	316454	316455	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ No , I do not indeed , ’
316457	316462	316464	316464	Perker	362	‘ Sorry for that , ’
316466	316477	316464	316464	Perker	362	‘ because it will form the subject of our conversation . ’
316478	316494	316496	316497	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I would rather that the subject should be never mentioned between us , Perker , ’
316500	316509	316511	316513	the little man	2005	‘ Pooh , pooh , my dear Sir , ’
316533	316591	316530	316530	his	2005	‘ It must be mentioned . I have come here on purpose . Now , are you ready to hear what I have to say , my dear Sir ? No hurry ; if you are not , I can wait . I have this morning ’s paper here . Your time shall be mine . There ! ’
316618	316623	316625	316626	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Well , well , ’
316642	316659	316625	316626	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Say what you have to say ; it ’s the old story , I suppose ? ’
316660	316673	316675	316675	Perker	362	‘ With a difference , my dear Sir ; with a difference , ’
316690	316707	316675	316675	Perker	362	‘ Mrs. Bardell , the plaintiff in the action , is within these walls , Sir . ’
316708	316713	316715	316716	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I know it , ’
316720	316724	316726	316726	Perker	362	‘ Very good , ’
316728	316751	316726	316726	Perker	362	‘ And you know how she comes here , I suppose ; I mean on what grounds , and at whose suit ? ’
316752	316767	316769	316770	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Yes ; at least I have heard Sam ’s account of the matter , ’
316776	316784	316786	316786	Perker	362	‘ Sam ’s account of the matter , ’
316788	316827	316786	316786	Perker	362	‘ is , I will venture to say , a perfectly correct one . Well now , my dear Sir , the first question I have to ask , is , whether this woman is to remain here ? ’
316828	316833	316835	316836	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ To remain here ! ’
316838	316847	316849	316849	Perker	362	‘ To remain here , my dear Sir , ’
316863	316870	316872	316873	that gentleman	9760	‘ How can you ask me ? ’
316875	316889	316872	316873	that gentleman	9760	‘ It rests with Dodson and Fogg ; you know that very well . ’
316890	316898	316900	316900	Perker	362	‘ I know nothing of the kind , ’
316903	316941	316900	316900	Perker	362	‘ It does _ not _ rest with Dodson and Fogg ; you know the men , my dear Sir , as well as I do . It rests solely , wholly , and entirely with you . ’
316942	316946	316948	316949	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ With me ! ’
316998	317002	316963	316965	The little man	2005	‘ With you . ’
317003	317011	317013	317015	the little man	2005	‘ I say , my dear Sir , ’
317081	317153	317078	317078	I	0	’ continued Perker , checking off each position on a different finger , as he laid it down--‘I say that nobody but you can rescue her from this den of wretchedness ; and that you can only do that , by paying the costs of this suit -- both of plaintive and defendant -- into the hands of these Freeman Court sharks . Now pray be quiet , my dear sir . ’
317204	317326	317191	317191	Perker	362	‘ I have seen the woman , this morning . By paying the costs , you can obtain a full release and discharge from the damages ; and further -- this I know is a far greater object of consideration with you , my dear sir -- a voluntary statement , under her hand , in the form of a letter to me , that this business was , from the very first , fomented , and encouraged , and brought about , by these men , Dodson and Fogg ; that she deeply regrets ever having been the instrument of annoyance or injury to you ; and that she entreats me to intercede with you , and implore your pardon . ’
317327	317336	317338	317339	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ If I pay her costs for her , ’
317342	317349	317338	317339	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ A valuable document , indeed ! ’
317350	317363	317365	317365	Perker	362	‘ No “ if ” in the case , my dear Sir , ’
317368	317412	317365	317365	Perker	362	‘ There is the very letter I speak of . Brought to my office by another woman at nine o’clock this morning , before I had set foot in this place , or held any communication with Mrs. Bardell , upon my honour . ’
317442	317453	317455	317456	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Is this all you have to say to me ? ’
317459	317463	317465	317465	Perker	362	‘ Not quite , ’
317467	317964	317465	317465	Perker	362	‘ I can not undertake to say , at this moment , whether the wording of the cognovit , the nature of the ostensible consideration , and the proof we can get together about the whole conduct of the suit , will be sufficient to justify an indictment for conspiracy . I fear not , my dear Sir ; they are too clever for that , I doubt . I do mean to say , however , that the whole facts , taken together , will be sufficient to justify you , in the minds of all reasonable men . And now , my dear Sir , I put it to you . This one hundred and fifty pounds , or whatever it may be -- take it in round numbers -- is nothing to you . A jury had decided against you ; well , their verdict is wrong , but still they decided as they thought right , and it _ is _ against you . You have now an opportunity , on easy terms , of placing yourself in a much higher position than you ever could , by remaining here ; which would only be imputed , by people who did n’t know you , to sheer dogged , wrongheaded , brutal obstinacy ; nothing else , my dear Sir , believe me . Can you hesitate to avail yourself of it , when it restores you to your friends , your old pursuits , your health and amusements ; when it liberates your faithful and attached servant , whom you otherwise doom to imprisonment for the whole of your life ; and above all , when it enables you to take the very magnanimous revenge -- which I know , my dear sir , is one after your own heart -- of releasing this woman from a scene of misery and debauchery , to which no man should ever be consigned , if I had my will , but the infliction of which on any woman , is even more frightful and barbarous . Now I ask you , my dear sir , not only as your legal adviser , but as your very true friend , will you let slip the occasion of attaining all these objects , and doing all this good , for the paltry consideration of a few pounds finding their way into the pockets of a couple of rascals , to whom it makes no manner of difference , except that the more they gain , the more they ’ll seek , and so the sooner be led into some piece of knavery that must end in a crash ? I have put these considerations to you , my dear Sir , very feebly and imperfectly , but I ask you to think of them . Turn them over in your mind as long as you please . I wait here most patiently for your answer . ’
318014	318019	318021	318022	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Dear , dear , ’
318035	318047	318021	318022	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ what an annoyance that door is ! Who is that ? ’
318048	318053	318055	318056	Sam Weller	356	‘ Me , Sir , ’
318063	318075	318077	318078	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I ca n’t speak to you just now , Sam , ’
318080	318090	318077	318078	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I am engaged at this moment , Sam . ’
318091	318098	318100	318101	Mr. Weller	356	‘ Beg your pardon , Sir , ’
318103	318123	318100	318101	Mr. Weller	356	‘ But here ’s a lady here , Sir , as says she ’s somethin’ wery partickler to disclose . ’
318124	318132	318134	318135	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I ca n’t see any lady , ’
318147	318155	318134	318135	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I would n’t make too sure o ’
318160	318169	318158	318158	Sir	9716	’ urged Mr. Weller , shaking his head . ‘
318209	318214	318193	318193	himself	8141	’ round the corner . ’
318215	318220	318222	318223	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Who is it ? ’
318225	318233	318235	318236	Mr. Weller	356	‘ Will you see her , Sir ? ’
318257	318263	318265	318266	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I suppose I must , ’
318272	318281	318283	318283	Sam	240	‘ Well then , all in to begin ! ’
318285	318301	318283	318283	Sam	240	‘ Sound the gong , draw up the curtain , and enter the two conspiraytors . ’
318384	318389	318391	318392	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Miss Arabella Allen ! ’
318399	318402	318404	318405	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ No , ’
318412	318424	318404	318405	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ Mrs. Winkle . Pardon , my dear friend , pardon ! ’
318484	318490	318492	318492	Arabella	297	‘ Oh , Mr. Pickwick ! ’
318506	318513	318492	318492	Arabella	297	‘ Can you forgive my imprudence ? ’
318704	318711	318713	318714	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Why , my dear girl , ’
318716	318747	318749	318750	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ how has all this come about ? Come ! Sit down , and let me hear it all . How well she looks , does n’t she , Perker ? ’
318774	318781	318783	318785	the little man	2005	‘ Delightful , my dear Sir , ’
318787	318808	318811	318811	himself	2005	‘ If I were not a married man myself , I should be disposed to envy you , you dog . ’
318865	318881	318883	318883	Arabella	297	‘ I can never be grateful enough to you , Sam , I am sure , ’
318891	318904	318883	318883	Arabella	297	‘ I shall not forget your exertions in the garden at Clifton . ’
318905	318916	318918	318918	Sam	356	‘ Do n’t say nothin’ wotever about it , ma’am , ’
318920	318946	318918	318918	Sam	356	‘ I only assisted natur , ma’am ; as the doctor said to the boy ’s mother , after he ’d bled him to death . ’
318947	318956	318958	318959	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Mary , my dear , sit down , ’
318966	318979	318958	318959	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Now then ; how long have you been married , eh ? ’
318992	318997	318980	318980	Arabella	297	‘ Only three days . ’
318998	319005	319007	319008	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Only three days , eh ? ’
319010	319022	319007	319008	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Why , what have you been doing these three months ? ’
319023	319030	319032	319032	Perker	362	‘ Ah , to be sure ! ’
319034	319061	319032	319032	Perker	362	‘ come , account for this idleness . You see Mr. Pickwick ’s only astonishment is , that it was n’t all over , months ago . ’
319062	319068	319070	319071	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ Why the fact is , ’
319080	319148	319070	319071	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ that I could not persuade Bella to run away , for a long time . And when I had persuaded her , it was a long time more before we could find an opportunity . Mary had to give a month ’s warning , too , before she could leave her place next door , and we could n’t possibly have done it without her assistance . ’
319153	319200	319202	319202	my	0	’ exclaimed Mr. Pickwick , who by this time had resumed his spectacles , and was looking from Arabella to Winkle , and from Winkle to Arabella , with as much delight depicted in his countenance as warmheartedness and kindly feeling can communicate to the human face-- ‘
319228	319229	319225	319226	my dear	10214	’ ‘
319236	319243	319225	319226	my dear	10214	’ replied Arabella , changing colour . ‘
319285	319292	319282	319283	Mr. Sawyer	356	’ added Arabella , looking down , ‘

319308	319313	319294	319294	I	0	’ said Perker gravely . ‘
319358	319374	319375	319375	You	240	’ And the little man took a warning pinch , and shook his head doubtfully . ‘
319381	319387	319388	319388	you	240	’ said Mr. Pickwick gently , ‘

319409	319413	319401	319401	I	0	’ replied Arabella . ‘
319520	320225	319507	319507	I	0	’ Here poor Arabella hid her face in her handkerchief , and wept bitterly . Mr. Pickwick ’s nature was a good deal worked upon , by these same tears ; but when Mrs. Winkle , drying her eyes , took to coaxing and entreating in the sweetest tones of a very sweet voice , he became particularly restless , and evidently undecided how to act , as was evinced by sundry nervous rubbings of his spectacle - glasses , nose , tights , head , and gaiters . Taking advantage of these symptoms of indecision , Mr. Perker ( to whom , it appeared , the young couple had driven straight that morning ) urged with legal point and shrewdness that Mr. Winkle , senior , was still unacquainted with the important rise in life ’s flight of steps which his son had taken ; that the future expectations of the said son depended entirely upon the said Winkle , senior , continuing to regard him with undiminished feelings of affection and attachment , which it was very unlikely he would , if this great event were long kept a secret from him ; that Mr. Pickwick , repairing to Bristol to seek Mr. Allen , might , with equal reason , repair to Birmingham to seek Mr. Winkle , senior ; lastly , that Mr. Winkle , senior , had good right and title to consider Mr. Pickwick as in some degree the guardian and adviser of his son , and that it consequently behoved that gentleman , and was indeed due to his personal character , to acquaint the aforesaid Winkle , senior , personally , and by word of mouth , with the whole circumstances of the case , and with the share he had taken in the transaction . Mr. Tupman and Mr. Snodgrass arrived , most opportunely , in this stage of the pleadings , and as it was necessary to explain to them all that had occurred , together with the various reasons pro and con , the whole of the arguments were gone over again , after which everybody urged every argument in his own way , and at his own length . And , at last , Mr. Pickwick , fairly argued and remonstrated out of all his resolutions , and being in imminent danger of being argued and remonstrated out of his wits , caught Arabella in his arms , and declaring that she was a very amiable creature , and that he did n’t know how it was , but he had always been very fond of her from the first , said he could never find it in his heart to stand in the way of young people ’s happiness , and they might do with him as they pleased . Mr. Weller ’s first act , on hearing this concession , was to despatch Job Trotter to the illustrious Mr. Pell , with an authority to deliver to the bearer the formal discharge which his prudent parent had had the foresight to leave in the hands of that learned gentleman , in case it should be , at any time , required on an emergency ; his next proceeding was , to invest his whole stock of ready - money in the purchase of five- and - twenty gallons of mild porter , which he himself dispensed on the racket - ground to everybody who would partake of it ; this done , he hurra’d in divers parts of the building until he lost his voice , and then quietly relapsed into his usual collected and philosophical condition . At three o’clock that afternoon , Mr. Pickwick took a last look at his little room , and made his way , as well as he could , through the throng of debtors who pressed eagerly forward to shake him by the hand , until he reached the lodge steps . He turned here , to look about him , and his eye lightened as he did so . In all the crowd of wan , emaciated faces , he saw not one which was not happier for his sympathy and charity . ‘
320228	320240	320226	320226	Perker	362	’ said Mr. Pickwick , beckoning one young man towards him , ‘
320253	320254	320243	320244	Mr. Jingle	419	’ ‘
320262	320271	320243	320244	Mr. Jingle	419	’ replied Perker , looking hard at Jingle . ‘
320305	320325	320303	320303	Sir	9716	’ Jingle bowed respectfully , trembled very much as he took Mr. Pickwick ’s proffered hand , and withdrew . ‘
320333	320342	320303	320303	Sir	9716	’ said Mr. Pickwick , presenting that gentleman . ‘
320348	320355	320345	320346	the rascal	8177	’ replied Perker good - humouredly . ‘

321214	321223	321204	321212	the governor and company of the Bank of England	8202	’ added Bob Sawyer , in legal phraseology . ‘
321227	321231	321204	321212	the governor and company of the Bank of England	8202	’ said Ben . ‘

321340	321347	321331	321331	she	297	’ said Mr. Ben Allen contemptuously . ‘

321385	321460	321478	321479	Mr. Sawyer	356	’ said Mr. Ben Allen , setting his teeth together , and speaking more like a savage warrior who fed on raw wolf ’s flesh which he carved with his fingers , than a peaceable young gentleman who ate minced veal with a knife and fork--‘I wish I knew whether any rascal really has been tampering with her , and attempting to engage her affections . I think I should assassinate him , Bob . ’
321461	321476	321478	321479	Mr. Sawyer	356	‘ I ’d put a bullet in him , if I found him out , ’
321501	321522	321523	321525	Mr. Benjamin Allen	657	‘ If that did n’t do his business , I ’d extract it afterwards , and kill him that way . ’
321540	321554	321523	321525	Mr. Benjamin Allen	657	‘ You have never proposed to her , point - blank , Bob ? ’
321555	321568	321570	321572	Mr. Robert Sawyer	8205	‘ No . Because I saw it would be of no use , ’
321574	321589	321591	321591	Ben	657	‘ You shall do it , before you are twenty - four hours older , ’
321597	321617	321591	321591	Ben	657	‘ She shall have you , or I ’ll know the reason why . I ’ll exert my authority . ’

321664	321748	321648	321648	He	657	‘ You have loved her from a child , my friend . You loved her when we were boys at school together , and , even then , she was wayward and slighted your young feelings . Do you recollect , with all the eagerness of a child ’s love , one day pressing upon her acceptance , two small caraway - seed biscuits and one sweet apple , neatly folded into a circular parcel with the leaf of a copy - book ? ’
321749	321753	321755	321756	Bob Sawyer	356	‘ I do , ’
321758	321766	321768	321769	Ben Allen	657	‘ She slighted that , I think ? ’

321779	321803	321777	321777	Bob	356	‘ She said I had kept the parcel so long in the pockets of my corduroys , that the apple was unpleasantly warm . ’

321814	321826	321810	321811	Mr. Allen	657	‘ Upon which we ate it ourselves , in alternate bites . ’

322270	322357	322358	322358	Dear	9784	’ replied Martin . So saying , the surly man leisurely descended from the wheel , on which he had been poising himself on the tops of the toes of his right foot , and having summoned the boy in the gray livery , opened the coach door , flung down the steps , and thrusting in a hand enveloped in a dark wash - leather glove , pulled out the old lady with as much unconcern in his manner as if she were a bandbox . ‘

322612	322643	322593	322595	the old lady	10352	‘ do n’t be alarmed , my dear , but I think I had better speak to Mr. Sawyer , alone , for a moment . Only for one moment . ’
322644	322647	322649	322650	Mr. Allen	657	‘ Bob , ’
322652	322662	322649	322650	Mr. Allen	657	‘ will you take my aunt into the surgery ? ’
322663	322666	322668	322668	Bob	356	‘ Certainly , ’
322676	322723	322668	322668	Bob	356	‘ Step this way , my dear ma’am . Do n’t be frightened , ma’am . We shall be able to set you to rights in a very short time , I have no doubt , ma’am . Here , my dear ma’am . Now then ! ’
322797	322800	322802	322803	Bob Sawyer	356	‘ Nervous , ’

322824	322836	322838	322840	the old lady	10352	‘ I do n’t know how to begin , Mr. Sawyer , ’
322842	322851	322838	322840	the old lady	10352	‘ It is so very painful and distressing . ’
322852	322860	322862	322864	Mr. Bob Sawyer	356	‘ You need not begin , ma’am , ’
322866	322881	322862	322864	Mr. Bob Sawyer	356	‘ I can anticipate all you would say . The head is in fault . ’
322882	322895	322897	322899	the old lady	10352	‘ I should be very sorry to think it was the heart , ’
322906	322916	322918	322919	Bob Sawyer	356	‘ Not the slightest danger of that , ma’am , ’
322921	322929	322918	322919	Bob Sawyer	356	‘ The stomach is the primary cause . ’
322930	322934	322936	322938	the old lady	10352	‘ Mr. Sawyer ! ’
322942	322952	322954	322954	Bob	356	‘ Not the least doubt of it , ma’am , ’
322960	322976	322918	322919	Bob Sawyer	356	‘ Medicine , in time , my dear ma’am , would have prevented it all . ’
322977	322981	322983	322985	the old lady	10352	‘ Mr. Sawyer , ’
322992	323060	323062	323064	the old lady	10352	‘ this conduct is either great impertinence to one in my situation , Sir , or it arises from your not understanding the object of my visit . If it had been in the power of medicine , or any foresight I could have used , to prevent what has occurred , I should certainly have done so . I had better see my nephew at once , ’

323251	323264	323334	323336	the old lady	10352	’ said Bob , quite forgetting his professional dignity in his anxiety . ‘

323315	323321	323309	323309	Bob	356	‘ Did she come back ? ’
323322	323332	323334	323336	the old lady	10352	‘ No , she did not ; she wrote , ’

323349	323356	323358	323359	the old	8257	‘ She said , Mr. Sawyer , ’

323487	323497	323498	323500	Mr. Ben Allen	657	‘ Ben , my boy , she ’s bolted ! ’

323955	323963	323952	323953	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ what is the matter , Sir ? ’
323964	323970	323972	323973	Mr. Allen	657	‘ Never mind , Sir ! ’
323979	323984	323986	323987	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ What is it ? ’
323994	323999	323986	323987	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Is he unwell ? ’
324022	324033	324005	324007	Mr. Ben Allen	657	‘ My sister , my dear Sir ; my sister . ’
324034	324041	324043	324044	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Oh , is that all ! ’
324046	324074	324043	324044	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ We shall easily arrange that matter , I hope . Your sister is safe and well , and I am here , my dear Sir , to-- ’
324075	324080	324005	324007	Mr. Ben Allen	657	‘ Sorry to do anythin ’
324103	324117	324098	324098	he	13168	’ interposed Mr. Weller , who had been peeping through the glass door ; ‘
324135	324140	324043	324044	Mr. Pickwick	240	’ on the carpet waitin ’
324151	324156	324098	324098	he	13168	’ and scientific inwention . ’

324183	324192	324180	324181	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Poor lady ! Gently Sam , gently . ’
324193	324199	324163	324165	Mr. Ben Allen	657	‘ Strange sitivation for one o ’
324203	324215	324163	324165	Mr. Ben Allen	657	’ observed Sam Weller , hoisting the aunt into a chair . ‘
324225	324339	324180	324181	Mr. Pickwick	240	’ The latter observation was addressed to the boy in gray , who , having handed over the fly to the care of the street - keeper , had come back to see what all the noise was about . Between the boy in gray , and Mr. Bob Sawyer , and Mr. Benjamin Allen ( who having frightened his aunt into a fainting fit , was affectionately solicitous for her recovery ) the old lady was at length restored to consciousness ; then Mr. Ben Allen , turning with a puzzled countenance to Mr. Pickwick , asked him what he was about to say , when he had been so alarmingly interrupted . ‘
324349	324433	324346	324346	I	0	’ said Mr. Pickwick , clearing his voice , and looking towards the man of few words with the surly countenance , who drove the fly with the chubby horse . This reminded Mr. Bob Sawyer that the boy in gray was looking on , with eyes wide open , and greedy ears . The incipient chemist having been lifted up by his coat collar , and dropped outside the door , Bob Sawyer assured Mr. Pickwick that he might speak without reserve . ‘
324441	324451	324346	324346	I	0	’ said Mr. Pickwick , turning to Benjamin Allen , ‘
324460	324461	324462	324462	Her	2572	’ ‘
324472	324484	324470	324470	sir	9716	’ said Benjamin Allen , with a flourish of the hand . ‘
324499	324504	324497	324497	Sir	9716	’ said Bob Sawyer . ‘
324537	324587	324590	324590	sir	9716	’ This , as it stood , was a very pretty denunciation , and magnanimous withal ; but Mr. Bob Sawyer rather weakened its effect , by winding up with some general observations concerning the punching of heads and knocking out of eyes , which were commonplace by comparison . ‘
324592	324597	324590	324590	sir	9716	’ said Mr. Pickwick ; ‘
324631	324632	324624	324624	he	7635	’ ‘
324635	324641	324624	324624	he	7635	’ said Mr. Bob Sawyer . ‘
324645	324650	324624	324624	he	7635	’ cried Ben Allen . ‘
324654	324655	324624	324624	he	7635	’ ‘
324660	324716	324656	324658	Mr. Nathaniel Winkle	276	’ said Mr. Pickwick . Mr. Benjamin Allen deliberately crushed his spectacles beneath the heel of his boot , and having picked up the pieces , and put them into three separate pockets , folded his arms , bit his lips , and looked in a threatening manner at the bland features of Mr. Pickwick . ‘
324736	324744	324720	324720	you	9716	’ inquired Mr. Benjamin Allen at length . ‘
324756	324762	324748	324749	this gentleman	10016	’ interrupted the old lady , ‘
324783	324784	324780	324781	their mistress.--Martin	8294	’ ‘
324787	324796	324780	324781	their mistress.--Martin	8294	’ said the surly man , coming forward . ‘
324817	324849	324852	324853	the man	835	’ Mr. Martin , who , as it has already appeared , was a man of few words , looked at Sam Weller , nodded his head , and growled forth , ‘
324855	324889	324852	324853	the man	835	’ Mr. Weller , who was never proud , gave a smile of friendly recognition as his eyes encountered those of the surly groom , and admitted in courteous terms , that he had ‘

324903	324909	324899	324901	the faithful creature	8298	’ exclaimed Mr. Ben Allen , ‘
324944	324945	324949	324949	sir	9716	’ ‘
324951	324957	324949	324949	sir	9716	’ cried Bob Sawyer fiercely . ‘
324963	324968	324969	324971	A regular plant	8304	’ said Ben Allen . ‘
324973	324979	324969	324971	A regular plant	8304	’ added Mr. Bob Sawyer . ‘
324984	324990	324969	324971	A regular plant	8304	’ observed the old lady . ‘
324996	325000	325003	325003	me	0	’ remarked Martin . ‘
325005	325033	325003	325003	me	0	’ urged Mr. Pickwick , as Mr. Ben Allen fell into a chair that patients were bled in , and gave way to his pocket - handkerchief . ‘
325109	325137	325153	325155	Mr. Benjamin Allen	657	’ added Mr. Pickwick , hastily checking himself--‘mind , I do not say I should have prevented it , if I had known that it was intended . ’
325138	325151	325153	325155	Mr. Benjamin Allen	657	‘ You hear that , all of you ; you hear that ? ’
325157	325163	325153	325155	Mr. Benjamin Allen	657	‘ I hope they do , ’
325172	325175	325177	325178	that gentleman	9760	‘ and , ’
325187	325325	325180	325180	his	9760	‘ I hope they hear this , Sir , also . That from what has been stated to me , sir , I assert that you were by no means justified in attempting to force your sister ’s inclinations as you did , and that you should rather have endeavoured by your kindness and forbearance to have supplied the place of other nearer relations whom she had never known , from a child . As regards my young friend , I must beg to add , that in every point of worldly advantage he is , at least , on an equal footing with yourself , if not on a much better one , and that unless I hear this question discussed with becoming temper and moderation , I decline hearing any more said upon the subject . ’
325326	325353	325355	325356	Mr. Weller	356	‘ I wish to make a wery few remarks in addition to wot has been put for’ard by the honourable gen’l’m’n as has jist give over , ’
325361	325377	325355	325356	Mr. Weller	356	‘ wich is this here : a indiwidual in company has called me a feller . ’
325378	325391	325393	325394	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ That has nothing whatever to do with the matter , Sam , ’
325396	325402	325393	325394	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Pray hold your tongue . ’

325421	325425	325180	325180	his	9760	’ replied Sam , ‘

326125	326129	326131	326132	Bob Sawyer	356	‘ And now , ’
326138	326146	326131	326132	Bob Sawyer	356	‘ we ’ll have a jolly night . ’
326147	326152	326154	326155	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I am sorry , ’
326157	326183	326154	326155	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ that I must return to my inn . I have not been accustomed to fatigue lately , and my journey has tired me exceedingly . ’
326184	326194	326196	326198	the old lady	10352	‘ You ’ll take some tea , Mr. Pickwick ? ’
326204	326213	326215	326216	that gentleman	9760	‘ Thank you , I would rather not , ’
326413	326423	326425	326425	Sam	356	‘ Shall I order a private room , Sir ? ’
326433	326440	326442	326443	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Why , no , Sam , ’
326445	326475	326442	326443	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ as I dined in the coffee - room , and shall go to bed soon , it is hardly worth while . See who there is in the travellers ’
326480	326517	326478	326478	Sam	240	’ Mr. Weller departed on his errand , and presently returned to say that there was only a gentleman with one eye ; and that he and the landlord were drinking a bowl of bishop together . ‘
326523	326528	326518	326518	I	0	’ said Mr. Pickwick . ‘
326543	326554	326541	326541	sir	9716	’ observed Mr. Weller , as he led the way . ‘
326560	326562	326541	326541	sir	9716	’ that ‘
326596	326668	326578	326578	he	8336	’ The individual to whom this observation referred , was sitting at the upper end of the room when Mr. Pickwick entered , and was smoking a large Dutch pipe , with his eye intently fixed on the round face of the landlord ; a jolly - looking old personage , to whom he had recently been relating some tale of wonder , as was testified by sundry disjointed exclamations of , ‘
326692	326718	326719	326719	Servant	15609	’ and other expressions of astonishment which burst spontaneously from his lips , as he returned the fixed gaze of the one - eyed man . ‘
326723	326734	326721	326721	sir	9716	’ said the one - eyed man to Mr. Pickwick . ‘

326747	326801	326738	326738	sir	9716	’ replied Mr. Pickwick , as the waiter placed a small decanter of brandy , and some hot water before him . While Mr. Pickwick was mixing his brandy - and - water , the one - eyed man looked round at him earnestly , from time to time , and at length said-- ‘
326810	326811	326802	326802	I	0	’ ‘
326818	326823	326812	326812	I	0	’ rejoined Mr. Pickwick . ‘

326867	326868	326847	326858	two friends of yours that were stopping at the Peacock at Eatanswill	8346	’ ‘
326873	326878	326847	326858	two friends of yours that were stopping at the Peacock at Eatanswill	8346	’ exclaimed Mr. Pickwick . ‘
326881	326889	326890	326890	I	0	’ rejoined the one - eyed man . ‘
326918	326919	326913	326913	them	8346	’ ‘
326922	326929	326913	326913	them	8346	’ rejoined Mr. Pickwick , smiling . ‘

326952	326960	326935	326935	I	0	’ replied the one - eyed man . ‘
326974	326982	326967	326970	that uncle of yours	8352	’ remarked the landlord shaking his head . ‘
326998	327006	326995	326995	he	8347	’ answered the one - eyed man . ‘
327026	327027	327029	327029	you	9716	’ ‘
327031	327036	327029	327029	you	9716	’ said Mr. Pickwick . ‘
327046	327136	327029	327029	you	9716	’ The one - eyed bagman ladled out a glass of negus from the bowl , and drank it ; smoked a long whiff out of the Dutch pipe ; and then , calling to Sam Weller who was lingering near the door , that he need n’t go away unless he wanted to , because the story was no secret , fixed his eye upon the landlord ’s , and proceeded , in the words of the next chapter . CHAPTER XLIX . CONTAINING THE STORY OF THE BAGMAN ’S
327143	327148	327138	327139	My uncle	2974	’ said the bagman , ‘
327339	327524	327331	327332	my uncle	2974	‘ I have always considered it a great point in my uncle ’s character , gentlemen , that he was the intimate friend and companion of Tom Smart , of the great house of Bilson and Slum , Cateaton Street , City . My uncle collected for Tiggin and Welps , but for a long time he went pretty near the same journey as Tom ; and the very first night they met , my uncle took a fancy for Tom , and Tom took a fancy for my uncle . They made a bet of a new hat before they had known each other half an hour , who should brew the best quart of punch and drink it the quickest . My uncle was judged to have won the making , but Tom Smart beat him in the drinking by about half a salt - spoonful . They took another quart apiece to drink each other ’s health in , and were staunch friends ever afterwards . There ’s a destiny in these things , gentlemen ; we ca n’t help it . ‘
327887	328088	327873	327873	he	2974	‘ My uncle ’s great journey was in the fall of the leaf , at which time he collected debts , and took orders , in the north ; going from London to Edinburgh , from Edinburgh to Glasgow , from Glasgow back to Edinburgh , and thence to London by the smack . You are to understand that his second visit to Edinburgh was for his own pleasure . He used to go back for a week , just to look up his old friends ; and what with breakfasting with this one , lunching with that , dining with the third , and supping with another , a pretty tight week he used to make of it . I do n’t know whether any of you , gentlemen , ever partook of a real substantial hospitable Scotch breakfast , and then went out to a slight lunch of a bushel of oysters , a dozen or so of bottled ale , and a noggin or two of whiskey to close up with . If you ever did , you will agree with me that it requires a pretty strong head to go out to dinner and supper afterwards . ‘
328230	328550	328555	328555	he	8396	‘ One night , within four - and - twenty hours of the time when he had settled to take shipping for London , my uncle supped at the house of a very old friend of his , a Bailie Mac something and four syllables after it , who lived in the old town of Edinburgh . There were the bailie ’s wife , and the bailie ’s three daughters , and the bailie ’s grown - up son , and three or four stout , bushy eye - browed , canny , old Scotch fellows , that the bailie had got together to do honour to my uncle , and help to make merry . It was a glorious supper . There was kippered salmon , and Finnan haddocks , and a lamb ’s head , and a haggis -- a celebrated Scotch dish , gentlemen , which my uncle used to say always looked to him , when it came to table , very much like a Cupid ’s stomach -- and a great many other things besides , that I forget the names of , but very good things , notwithstanding . The lassies were pretty and agreeable ; the bailie ’s wife was one of the best creatures that ever lived ; and my uncle was in thoroughly good cue . The consequence of which was , that the young ladies tittered and giggled , and the old lady laughed out loud , and the bailie and the other old fellows roared till they were red in the face , the whole mortal time . I do n’t quite recollect how many tumblers of whiskey- toddy each man drank after supper ; but this I know , that about one o’clock in the morning , the bailie ’s grown - up son became insensible while attempting the first verse of “ Willie brewed a peck o ’
328701	328904	328905	328906	The bailie	17122	‘ It was a wild , gusty night when my uncle closed the bailie ’s door , and settling his hat firmly on his head to prevent the wind from taking it , thrust his hands into his pockets , and looking upward , took a short survey of the state of the weather . The clouds were drifting over the moon at their giddiest speed ; at one time wholly obscuring her ; at another , suffering her to burst forth in full splendour and shed her light on all the objects around ; anon , driving over her again , with increased velocity , and shrouding everything in darkness . “ Really , this wo n’t do , ” said my uncle , addressing himself to the weather , as if he felt himself personally offended . “ This is not at all the kind of thing for my voyage . It will not do at any price , ” said my uncle , very impressively . Having repeated this , several times , he recovered his balance with some difficulty -- for he was rather giddy with looking up into the sky so long -- and walked merrily on . ‘
329192	329266	329267	329267	Gentlemen	10163	‘ I am particular in describing how my uncle walked up the middle of the street , with his thumbs in his waistcoat pockets , gentlemen , because , as he often used to say ( and with great reason too ) there is nothing at all extraordinary in this story , unless you distinctly understand at the beginning , that he was not by any means of a marvellous or romantic turn . ‘
329588	329797	329573	329573	he	2974	‘ When my uncle reached the end of Leith Walk , he had to cross a pretty large piece of waste ground which separated him from a short street which he had to turn down to go direct to his lodging . Now , in this piece of waste ground , there was , at that time , an enclosure belonging to some wheelwright who contracted with the Post Office for the purchase of old , worn - out mail coaches ; and my uncle , being very fond of coaches , old , young , or middle - aged , all at once took it into his head to step out of his road for no other purpose than to peep between the palings at these mails -- about a dozen of which he remembered to have seen , crowded together in a very forlorn and dismantled state , inside . My uncle was a very enthusiastic , emphatic sort of person , gentlemen ; so , finding that he could not obtain a good peep between the palings he got over them , and sitting himself quietly down on an old axle - tree , began to contemplate the mail coaches with a deal of gravity . ‘
329972	330126	330127	330127	Gentlemen	10163	‘ My uncle rested his head upon his hands , and thought of the busy , bustling people who had rattled about , years before , in the old coaches , and were now as silent and changed ; he thought of the numbers of people to whom one of these crazy , mouldering vehicles had borne , night after night , for many years , and through all weathers , the anxiously expected intelligence , the eagerly looked - for remittance , the promised assurance of health and safety , the sudden announcement of sickness and death . The merchant , the lover , the wife , the widow , the mother , the school - boy , the very child who tottered to the door at the postman ’s knock -- how had they all looked forward to the arrival of the old coach . And where were they all now ? ‘
330270	330297	330253	330254	my uncle	2974	‘ Be this as it may , a church bell struck two . My uncle woke , rubbed his eyes , and jumped up in astonishment . ‘
330480	330484	330495	330495	my	0	‘ em again . ‘
330506	330519	330526	330527	my uncle	2974	’re booked for one inside . You ’d better get in . ” ‘
330532	330539	330521	330521	I	0	‘ “ Yes , certainly . ” ‘
330726	330827	330718	330719	My uncle	2974	‘ “ Now , are you going to get in ? ” said the person who had addressed my uncle before . He was dressed as a mail guard , with a wig on his head and most enormous cuffs to his coat , and had a lantern in one hand , and a huge blunderbuss in the other , which he was going to stow away in his little arm - chest . “ _ are _ you going to get in , Jack Martin ? ” said the guard , holding the lantern to my uncle ’s face . ‘
330849	330865	330833	330834	my uncle	2974	‘ “ It ’s so on the way - bill , ” said the guard . ‘
330871	330873	330879	330880	my uncle	2974	‘ Mister ’
330920	330934	330943	330944	my uncle	2974	‘ “ No , there is not , ” rejoined the guard coolly . ‘
330946	330958	330943	330944	my uncle	2974	‘ “ Of course it is , ” rejoined the guard . ‘
330980	331026	331028	331029	the guard	13722	‘ “ This , ” said the guard , pointing to an old - fashioned Edinburgh and London mail , which had the steps down and the door open . “ Stop ! Here are the other passengers . Let them get in first . ” ‘
331426	331624	331395	331395	he	2974	‘ But , in this one glimpse of the beautiful face , my uncle saw that the young lady cast an imploring look upon him , and that she appeared terrified and distressed . He noticed , too , that the young fellow in the powdered wig , notwithstanding his show of gallantry , which was all very fine and grand , clasped her tight by the wrist when she got in , and followed himself immediately afterwards . An uncommonly ill - looking fellow , in a close brown wig , and a plum - coloured suit , wearing a very large sword , and boots up to his hips , belonged to the party ; and when he sat himself down next to the young lady , who shrank into a corner at his approach , my uncle was confirmed in his original impression that something dark and mysterious was going forward , or , as he always said himself , that “ there was a screw loose somewhere . ” It ’s quite surprising how quickly he made up his mind to help the lady at any peril , if she needed any help . ‘
331649	331732	331637	331637	his	14567	‘ “ Blood and thunder ! ” roared the other gentleman . With this , he whipped his sword out , and made a lunge at my uncle without further ceremony . My uncle had no weapon about him , but with great dexterity he snatched the ill - looking gentleman ’s three - cornered hat from his head , and , receiving the point of his sword right through the crown , squeezed the sides together , and held it tight . ‘
331757	331900	331740	331744	the ill - looking gentleman	17199	‘ “ He had better not , ” cried my uncle , displaying the heel of one of his shoes , in a threatening manner . “ I ’ll kick his brains out , if he has any-- , or fracture his skull if he has n’t . ” Exerting all his strength , at this moment , my uncle wrenched the ill - looking man ’s sword from his grasp , and flung it clean out of the coach window , upon which the younger gentleman vociferated , “ Death and lightning ! ” again , and laid his hand upon the hilt of his sword , in a very fierce manner , but did n’t draw it . Perhaps , gentlemen , as my uncle used to say with a smile , perhaps he was afraid of alarming the lady . ‘
331980	332094	332113	332114	my uncle	2974	‘ As quickly as my uncle said the words , the guard appeared at the coach window , with the gentleman ’s sword in his hand . He held up his lantern , and looked earnestly in my uncle ’s face , as he handed it in , when , by its light , my uncle saw , to his great surprise , that an immense crowd of mail - coach guards swarmed round the window , every one of whom had his eyes earnestly fixed upon him too . He had never seen such a sea of white faces , red bodies , and earnest eyes , in all his born days . ‘
332128	332190	332113	332114	my uncle	2974	‘ The ill - looking gentleman received his three - cornered hat in silence , looked at the hole in the middle with an inquiring air , and finally stuck it on the top of his wig with a solemnity the effect of which was a trifle impaired by his sneezing violently at the moment , and jerking it off again . ‘
332313	332508	332295	332295	he	2974	‘ At present , however , his thoughts were occupied with the young lady who sat in the farthest corner of the coach , with her face muffled closely in her hood ; the gentleman with the sky - blue coat sitting opposite to her ; the other man in the plum - coloured suit , by her side ; and both watching her intently . If she so much as rustled the folds of her hood , he could hear the ill - looking man clap his hand upon his sword , and could tell by the other ’s breathing ( it was so dark he could n’t see his face ) that he was looking as big as if he were going to devour her at a mouthful . This roused my uncle more and more , and he resolved , come what might , to see the end of it . He had a great admiration for bright eyes , and sweet faces , and pretty legs and feet ; in short , he was fond of the whole sex . It runs in our family , gentleman -- so am I. ‘
332687	332713	332720	332721	the guard	13722	‘ All of a sudden the coach stopped . “ Hollo ! ” said my uncle , “ what ’s in the wind now ? ” ‘
332728	332737	332720	332721	the guard	13722	‘ “ Here ! ” cried my uncle . ‘
332746	332761	332743	332744	the guard	13722	‘ “ I ’ll do nothing of the sort , ” said my uncle . ‘
332777	332787	332774	332775	the guard	13722	‘ “ I will , ” said my uncle . ‘
332796	332926	332793	332794	the guard	13722	‘ The passengers had regarded this colloquy with great attention , and , finding that my uncle was determined not to alight , the younger man squeezed past him , to hand the lady out . At this moment , the ill - looking man was inspecting the hole in the crown of his three - cornered hat . As the young lady brushed past , she dropped one of her gloves into my uncle ’s hand , and softly whispered , with her lips so close to his face that he felt her warm breath on his nose , the single word “ Help ! ” Gentlemen , my uncle leaped out of the coach at once , with such violence that it rocked on the springs again . ‘
332955	333084	332946	332946	he	13722	‘ My uncle looked at the guard for a few seconds , in some doubt whether it would n’t be better to wrench his blunderbuss from him , fire it in the face of the man with the big sword , knock the rest of the company over the head with the stock , snatch up the young lady , and go off in the smoke . On second thoughts , however , he abandoned this plan , as being a shade too melodramatic in the execution , and followed the two mysterious men , who , keeping the lady between them , were now entering an old house in front of which the coach had stopped . They turned into the passage , and my uncle followed . ‘
333197	333266	333267	333268	My uncle	2974	‘ “ Well , ” said my uncle , as he looked about him , “ a mail travelling at the rate of six miles and a half an hour , and stopping for an indefinite time at such a hole as this , is rather an irregular sort of proceeding , I fancy . This shall be made known . I ’ll write to the papers . ” ‘
333355	333372	333340	333340	she	10556	‘ At length the two strangers advanced a little , and the conversation began in earnest . ‘
333398	333503	333391	333396	the gentleman in sky - blue	8553	‘ “ No , I do not , fellow , ” rejoined my uncle . “ Only , if this is a private room specially ordered for the occasion , I should think the public room must be a _ very _ comfortable one ; ” with this , my uncle sat himself down in a high - backed chair , and took such an accurate measure of the gentleman , with his eyes , that Tiggin and Welps could have supplied him with printed calico for a suit , and not an inch too much or too little , from that estimate alone . ‘
333519	333537	333511	333512	both men	8555	‘ “ Eh ? ” said my uncle , not at all appearing to comprehend their meaning . ‘
333575	333616	333552	333560	the ill - looking fellow with the large sword	8559	‘ “ Down with him ! ” cried the gentleman in sky - blue , drawing his sword also , and falling back two or three yards . “ Down with him ! ” The lady gave a loud scream . ‘
333767	333964	333980	333980	troopers	8567	‘ Gentlemen , there is an old story -- none the worse for being true-- regarding a fine young Irish gentleman , who being asked if he could play the fiddle , replied he had no doubt he could , but he could n’t exactly say , for certain , because he had never tried . This is not inapplicable to my uncle and his fencing . He had never had a sword in his hand before , except once when he played Richard the Third at a private theatre , upon which occasion it was arranged with Richmond that he was to be run through , from behind , without showing fight at all . But here he was , cutting and slashing with two experienced swordsman , thrusting , and guarding , and poking , and slicing , and acquitting himself in the most manful and dexterous manner possible , although up to that time he had never been aware that he had the least notion of the science . It only shows how true the old saying is , that a man never knows what he can do till he tries , gentlemen . ‘
334081	334345	334355	334356	the lady	10556	‘ At this very moment , the gentleman in sky - blue turning round , and seeing the young lady with her face uncovered , vented an exclamation of rage and jealousy , and , turning his weapon against her beautiful bosom , pointed a thrust at her heart , which caused my uncle to utter a cry of apprehension that made the building ring . The lady stepped lightly aside , and snatching the young man ’s sword from his hand , before he had recovered his balance , drove him to the wall , and running it through him , and the panelling , up to the very hilt , pinned him there , hard and fast . It was a splendid example . My uncle , with a loud shout of triumph , and a strength that was irresistible , made his adversary retreat in the same direction , and plunging the old rapier into the very centre of a large red flower in the pattern of his waistcoat , nailed him beside his friend ; there they both stood , gentlemen , jerking their arms and legs about in agony , like the toy - shop figures that are moved by a piece of pack - thread . My uncle always said , afterwards , that this was one of the surest means he knew of , for disposing of an enemy ; but it was liable to one objection on the ground of expense , inasmuch as it involved the loss of a sword for every man disabled . ‘
334379	334440	334365	334365	her	10556	‘ “ May ! ” cried my uncle ; “ why , my dear , there ’s nobody else to kill , is there ? ” My uncle was rather disappointed , gentlemen , for he thought a little quiet bit of love - making would be agreeable after the slaughtering , if it were only to change the subject . ‘
334482	334491	334503	334504	my uncle	2974	‘ “ Well then , my dear , I ’m
334542	334584	334531	334531	You	2945	‘ “ I have been torn from my home and my friends by these villains , ” said the young lady , her features glowing with indignation . “ That wretch would have married me by violence in another hour . ” ‘
334607	334742	334592	334593	my uncle	2974	‘ “ As you may guess from what you have seen , ” said the young lady , “ the party were prepared to murder me if I appealed to any one for assistance . If their accomplices find us here , we are lost . Two minutes hence may be too late . The mail ! ” With these words , overpowered by her feelings , and the exertion of sticking the young Marquess of Filletoville , she sank into my uncle ’s arms . My uncle caught her up , and bore her to the house door . There stood the mail , with four long - tailed , flowing - maned , black horses , ready harnessed ; but no coachman , no guard , no hostler even , at the horses ’
334745	334948	334958	334960	the young lady	2945	‘ Gentlemen , I hope I do no injustice to my uncle ’s memory , when I express my opinion , that although he was a bachelor , he had held some ladies in his arms before this time ; I believe , indeed , that he had rather a habit of kissing barmaids ; and I know , that in one or two instances , he had been seen by credible witnesses , to hug a landlady in a very perceptible manner . I mention the circumstance , to show what a very uncommon sort of person this beautiful young lady must have been , to have affected my uncle in the way she did ; he used to say , that as her long dark hair trailed over his arm , and her beautiful dark eyes fixed themselves upon his face when she recovered , he felt so strange and nervous that his legs trembled beneath him . But who can look in a sweet , soft pair of dark eyes , without feeling queer ? I ca n’t , gentlemen . I am afraid to look at some eyes I know , and that ’s the truth of it . ‘
334962	334977	334958	334960	the young lady	2945	‘ “ Never , ” said my uncle . And he meant it too . ‘
334999	335012	334985	334987	the young lady	2945	‘ “ Do n’t , ” said my uncle , interrupting her . ‘
335014	335023	334985	334987	the young lady	2945	‘ Why ? ” inquired the young lady . ‘
335043	335055	335056	335058	The young lady	2945	’m afraid I shall be rude enough to kiss it . ” ‘
335158	335180	335188	335189	my uncle	2974	‘ “ Hark ! ” cried the young lady , starting . “ The noise of wheels , and horses ! ” ‘
335253	335283	335321	335321	his	2974	‘ “ We are pursued ! ” cried the young lady , clasping her hands . “ We are pursued . I have no hope but in you ! ” ‘
335349	335361	335370	335371	my uncle	2974	‘ “ Stay , love , ” cried the young lady . ‘
335379	335406	335370	335371	my uncle	2974	‘ “ I want to speak to you , ” said the young lady ; “ only a word . Only one word , dearest . ” ‘
335455	335519	335445	335446	My uncle	2974	‘ “ What is it , my dear ? ” said my uncle , looking in at the coach window . The lady happened to bend forward at the same time , and my uncle thought she looked more beautiful than she had done yet . He was very close to her just then , gentlemen , so he really ought to know . ‘
335533	335556	335557	335557	My	0	‘ “ Will you never love any one but me -- never marry any one beside ? ” said the young lady . ‘
335656	335720	335721	335721	They	8617	‘ The noise behind grew louder . The faster the old mail went , the faster came the pursuers -- men , horses , dogs , were leagued in the pursuit . The noise was frightful , but , above all , rose the voice of the young lady , urging my uncle on , and shrieking , “ Faster ! Faster ! ” ‘
335792	335922	335780	335782	the young lady	2945	‘ My uncle plied whip and rein , and the horses flew onward till they were white with foam ; and yet the noise behind increased ; and yet the young lady cried , “ Faster ! Faster ! ” My uncle gave a loud stamp on the boot in the energy of the moment , and -- found that it was gray morning , and he was sitting in the wheelwright ’s yard , on the box of an old Edinburgh mail , shivering with the cold and wet and stamping his feet to warm them ! He got down , and looked eagerly inside for the beautiful young lady . Alas ! There was neither door nor seat to the coach . It was a mere shell . ‘
336086	336087	336071	336071	he	2974	’ ‘
336102	336118	336099	336099	their	8627	’ said the landlord , who had listened to the whole story with profound attention . ‘
336126	336131	336071	336071	he	2974	’ said the bagman . ‘
336140	336145	336071	336071	he	2974	’ rejoined the landlord . ‘
336152	336268	336269	336269	Sawyer	657	’ CHAPTER L. HOW MR . PICKWICK SPED UPON HIS MISSION , AND HOW HE WAS REINFORCED IN THE OUTSET BY A MOST UNEXPECTED AUXILIARY The horses were put to , punctually at a quarter before nine next morning , and Mr. Pickwick and Sam Weller having each taken his seat , the one inside and the other out , the postillion was duly directed to repair in the first instance to Mr. Bob Sawyer ’s house , for the purpose of taking up Mr. Benjamin Allen . It was with feelings of no small astonishment , when the carriage drew up before the door with the red lamp , and the very legible inscription of ‘
336274	336359	336269	336269	Sawyer	657	’ that Mr. Pickwick saw , on popping his head out of the coach window , the boy in the gray livery very busily employed in putting up the shutters -- the which , being an unusual and an unbusinesslike proceeding at that hour of the morning , at once suggested to his mind two inferences : the one , that some good friend and patient of Mr. Bob Sawyer ’s was dead ; the other , that Mr. Bob Sawyer himself was bankrupt . ‘
336365	336373	336493	336495	Mr. Bob Sawyer	356	’ said Mr. Pickwick to the boy . ‘
336381	336397	336379	336379	Sir	9716	’ replied the boy , expanding his mouth to the whole breadth of his countenance . ‘
336404	336441	336442	336442	I	0	’ cried Bob Sawyer , suddenly appearing at the door , with a small leathern knapsack , limp and dirty , in one hand , and a rough coat and shawl thrown over the other arm . ‘
336443	336449	336493	336495	Mr. Bob Sawyer	356	’m going , old fellow . ’
336450	336453	336455	336456	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ You ! ’
336458	336461	336463	336464	Bob Sawyer	356	‘ Yes , ’
336466	336484	336463	336464	Bob Sawyer	356	‘ and a regular expedition we ’ll make of it . Here , Sam ! Look out ! ’
336575	336586	336588	336588	Bob	356	‘ What a start it is , is n’t it ? ’
336608	336613	336615	336616	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ My dear Sir , ’
336622	336632	336615	336616	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I had no idea of your accompanying us . ’
336633	336643	336645	336645	Bob	356	‘ No , that ’s just the very thing , ’
336657	336663	336645	336645	Bob	356	‘ That ’s the joke . ’
336664	336675	336677	336678	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Oh , that ’s the joke , is it ? ’
336680	336684	336686	336686	Bob	356	‘ Of course , ’
336688	336728	336686	336686	Bob	356	‘ It ’s the whole point of the thing , you know-- that , and leaving the business to take care of itself , as it seems to have made up its mind not to take care of me . ’
336755	336777	336779	336780	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Bless me , you are surely not mad enough to think of leaving your patients without anybody to attend them ! ’
336787	336791	336793	336793	Bob	356	‘ Why not ? ’
336798	336816	336818	336818	Bob	356	‘ I shall save by it , you know . None of them ever pay . Besides , ’
336828	336890	336818	336818	Bob	356	‘ they will be all the better for it ; for , being nearly out of drugs , and not able to increase my account just now , I should have been obliged to give them calomel all round , and it would have been certain to have disagreed with some of them . So it ’s all for the best . ’
336925	336947	336912	336912	He	240	‘ But this chaise , my young friend , will only hold two ; and I am pledged to Mr. Allen . ’

336962	337071	337073	337073	Bob	356	‘ I ’ve arranged it all ; Sam and I will share the dickey between us . Look here . This little bill is to be wafered on the shop door : “ Sawyer , late Nockemorf . Inquire of Mrs. Cripps over the way . ” Mrs. Cripps is my boy ’s mother . “ Mr. Sawyer ’s very sorry , ” says Mrs. Cripps , “ could n’t help it -- fetched away early this morning to a consultation of the very first surgeons in the country -- couldn’t do without him -- would have him at any price-- tremendous operation . ” The fact is , ’
337078	337119	337073	337073	Bob	356	‘ it ’ll do me more good than otherwise , I expect . If it gets into one of the local papers , it will be the making of me . Here ’s Ben ; now then , jump in ! ’

337463	337480	337462	337462	They	8647	’re not used to see this sort of thing , every day , I dare say . ’

337489	337499	337486	337487	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ It may be so . Perhaps it is . ’
337588	337592	337594	337595	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I hope , ’
337597	337611	337594	337595	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ that our volatile friend is committing no absurdities in that dickey behind . ’

337623	337637	337620	337621	Ben Allen	657	‘ Except when he ’s elevated , Bob ’s the quietest creature breathing . ’

338434	338443	338445	338446	Ben Allen	657	‘ It looks like a case - bottle ; ’

338544	338554	338536	338537	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ This proceeding is more absurd than the other . ’

339119	339131	339109	339110	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ his pranks are really very amusing ; very entertaining indeed . ’
339132	339138	339140	339142	Mr. Ben Allen	657	‘ You may say that , ’
339213	339218	339226	339226	we	8670	‘ I say ! We ’re
339228	339238	339226	339226	we	8670	’ said Bob , looking in at the window . ‘
339241	339246	339226	339226	we	8670	’ said Mr. Pickwick . ‘
339267	339268	339226	339226	we	8670	’ ‘
339287	339293	339226	339226	we	8670	’ remonstrated Mr. Bob Sawyer . ‘
339312	339322	339226	339226	we	8670	’ replied Mr. Pickwick , looking at his watch . ‘
339327	339331	339226	339226	we	8670	’ rejoined Bob , ‘
339388	340014	340029	340030	Mr. Winkle	276	’ Issuing these orders with monstrous importance and bustle , Mr. Bob Sawyer at once hurried into the house to superintend the arrangements ; in less than five minutes he returned and declared them to be excellent . The quality of the lunch fully justified the eulogium which Bob had pronounced , and very great justice was done to it , not only by that gentleman , but Mr. Ben Allen and Mr. Pickwick also . Under the auspices of the three , the bottled ale and the Madeira were promptly disposed of ; and when ( the horses being once more put to ) they resumed their seats , with the case - bottle full of the best substitute for milk - punch that could be procured on so short a notice , the key - bugle sounded , and the red flag waved , without the slightest opposition on Mr. Pickwick ’s part . At the Hop Pole at Tewkesbury , they stopped to dine ; upon which occasion there was more bottled ale , with some more Madeira , and some port besides ; and here the case - bottle was replenished for the fourth time . Under the influence of these combined stimulants , Mr. Pickwick and Mr. Ben Allen fell fast asleep for thirty miles , while Bob and Mr. Weller sang duets in the dickey . It was quite dark when Mr. Pickwick roused himself sufficiently to look out of the window . The straggling cottages by the road - side , the dingy hue of every object visible , the murky atmosphere , the paths of cinders and brick - dust , the deep - red glow of furnace fires in the distance , the volumes of dense smoke issuing heavily forth from high toppling chimneys , blackening and obscuring everything around ; the glare of distant lights , the ponderous wagons which toiled along the road , laden with clashing rods of iron , or piled with heavy goods -- all betokened their rapid approach to the great working town of Birmingham . As they rattled through the narrow thoroughfares leading to the heart of the turmoil , the sights and sounds of earnest occupation struck more forcibly on the senses . The streets were thronged with working people . The hum of labour resounded from every house ; lights gleamed from the long casement windows in the attic storeys , and the whirl of wheels and noise of machinery shook the trembling walls . The fires , whose lurid , sullen light had been visible for miles , blazed fiercely up , in the great works and factories of the town . The din of hammers , the rushing of steam , and the dead heavy clanking of engines , was the harsh music which arose from every quarter . The postboy was driving briskly through the open streets , and past the handsome and well - lighted shops that intervene between the outskirts of the town and the Old Royal Hotel , before Mr. Pickwick had begun to consider the very difficult and delicate nature of the commission which had carried him thither . The delicate nature of this commission , and the difficulty of executing it in a satisfactory manner , were by no means lessened by the voluntary companionship of Mr. Bob Sawyer . Truth to tell , Mr. Pickwick felt that his presence on the occasion , however considerate and gratifying , was by no means an honour he would willingly have sought ; in fact , he would cheerfully have given a reasonable sum of money to have had Mr. Bob Sawyer removed to any place at not less than fifty miles ’
340111	340114	340116	340117	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ However , ’
340124	340182	340116	340117	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I must do the best I can . I must see him to - night , for I faithfully promised to do so . If they persist in accompanying me , I must make the interview as brief as possible , and be content that , for their own sakes , they will not expose themselves . ’
340259	340265	340267	340268	the waiter	9785	‘ Close by , Sir , ’
340270	340312	340267	340268	the waiter	9785	‘ not above five hundred yards , Sir . Mr. Winkle is a wharfinger , Sir , at the canal , sir . Private residence is not -- oh dear , no , sir , not five hundred yards , sir . ’
340350	340357	340359	340360	the waiter	9785	‘ Take anything now , Sir ? ’
340373	340384	340359	340360	the waiter	9785	‘ Tea or coffee , Sir ? Dinner , sir ? ’
340385	340389	340359	340360	the waiter	9785	‘ Nothing now . ’
340390	340403	340359	340360	the waiter	9785	‘ Very good , sir . Like to order supper , Sir ? ’
340404	340409	340359	340360	the waiter	9785	‘ Not just now . ’
340410	340416	340419	340419	he	240	‘ Very good , Sir . ’
340439	340448	340419	340419	he	240	‘ Shall I send the chambermaid , gentlemen ? ’
340449	340456	340458	340459	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ You may if you please , ’
340461	340470	340458	340459	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ If _ you _ please , sir . ’
340471	340479	340481	340482	Bob Sawyer	356	‘ And bring some soda - water , ’
340484	340495	340481	340482	Bob Sawyer	356	‘ Soda - water , Sir ! Yes , Sir . ’
340681	340685	340727	340731	A smart servant - girl	8691	‘ Mr. Winkle . ’
340744	340754	340756	340757	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Is Mr. Winkle at home , my dear ? ’
340759	340769	340771	340772	the girl	9813	‘ He is just going to supper , Sir , ’
340774	340783	340785	340786	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Give him that card if you please , ’
340788	340818	340819	340820	The girl	9813	‘ Say I am sorry to trouble him at so late an hour ; but I am anxious to see him to- night , and have only just arrived . ’
340998	341011	341013	341014	the girl	9813	‘ Very sorry to leave you standing at the door , Sir , ’
341029	341060	341013	341014	the girl	9813	‘ but you was quite strangers to me ; and we have such a many trampers that only come to see what they can lay their hands on , that really-- ’
341061	341075	341077	341078	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ There is not the least occasion for any apology , my dear , ’
341083	341091	341093	341094	Bob Sawyer	356	‘ Not the slightest , my love , ’
341147	341151	341134	341134	she	2945	‘ odous creetur ; ’
341339	341350	341352	341352	Winkle	276	‘ Mr. Pickwick , sir , how do you do ? ’
341365	341393	341353	341354	the elder	12538	‘ Hope I see you well , sir . Glad to see you . Be seated , Mr. Pickwick , I beg , Sir . This gentleman is-- ’
341394	341401	341403	341404	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ My friend , Mr. Sawyer , ’
341406	341412	341403	341404	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ your son ’s friend . ’
341413	341416	341420	341421	the elder	12538	‘ Oh , ’
341429	341438	341420	341421	the elder	12538	‘ I hope you are well , sir . ’
341439	341447	341449	341450	Bob Sawyer	356	‘ Right as a trivet , sir , ’
341452	341457	341459	341460	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ This other gentleman , ’
341462	341505	341459	341460	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ is , as you will see when you have read the letter with which I am intrusted , a very near relative , or I should rather say a very particular friend of your son ’s . His name is Allen . ’
341506	341512	341514	341515	Mr. Winkle	276	‘ _ That _ gentleman ? ’
341685	341691	341695	341695	he	657	‘ till dinner - time ; ’
341789	341901	341903	341904	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ This letter , Sir , is from your son . You will see , by its contents , that on your favourable and fatherly consideration of it , depend his future happiness and welfare . Will you oblige me by giving it the calmest and coolest perusal , and by discussing the subject afterwards with me , in the tone and spirit in which alone it ought to be discussed ? You may judge of the importance of your decision to your son , and his intense anxiety upon the subject , by my waiting upon you , without any previous warning , at so late an hour ; and , ’
341917	342201	341903	341904	Mr. Pickwick	240	’ With this prelude , Mr. Pickwick placed four closely - written sides of extra superfine wire - wove penitence in the hands of the astounded Mr. Winkle , senior . Then reseating himself in his chair , he watched his looks and manner : anxiously , it is true , but with the open front of a gentleman who feels he has taken no part which he need excuse or palliate . The old wharfinger turned the letter over , looked at the front , back , and sides , made a microscopic examination of the fat little boy on the seal , raised his eyes to Mr. Pickwick ’s face , and then , seating himself on the high stool , and drawing the lamp closer to him , broke the wax , unfolded the epistle , and lifting it to the light , prepared to read . Just at this moment , Mr. Bob Sawyer , whose wit had lain dormant for some minutes , placed his hands on his knees , and made a face after the portraits of the late Mr. Grimaldi , as clown . It so happened that Mr. Winkle , senior , instead of being deeply engaged in reading the letter , as Mr. Bob Sawyer thought , chanced to be looking over the top of it at no less a person than Mr. Bob Sawyer himself ; rightly conjecturing that the face aforesaid was made in ridicule and derision of his own person , he fixed his eyes on Bob with such expressive sternness , that the late Mr. Grimaldi ’s lineaments gradually resolved themselves into a very fine expression of humility and confusion . ‘
342208	342220	342203	342203	you	8719	’ inquired Mr. Winkle , senior , after an awful silence . ‘
342225	342248	342223	342223	sir	9716	’ replied Bob , With no remains of the clown about him , save and except the extreme redness of his cheeks . ‘
342258	342265	342249	342249	You	8719	’ said Mr. Winkle , senior . ‘
342275	342279	342271	342271	sir	9716	’ replied Bob . ‘
342287	342297	342285	342285	Sir	9716	’ replied the old gentleman , with indignant emphasis . ‘
342308	342309	342299	342299	you	8719	’ ‘
342320	342328	342314	342314	sir	9716	’ replied Bob , with extreme civility . ‘
342339	342529	342337	342337	sir	9716	’ said Mr. Winkle , senior . Having frowned upon the abashed Bob with great magnificence , the old gentleman again brought the letter to the light , and began to read it seriously . Mr. Pickwick eyed him intently as he turned from the bottom line of the first page to the top line of the second , and from the bottom of the second to the top of the third , and from the bottom of the third to the top of the fourth ; but not the slightest alteration of countenance afforded a clue to the feelings with which he received the announcement of his son ’s marriage , which Mr. Pickwick knew was in the very first half - dozen lines . He read the letter to the last word , folded it again with all the carefulness and precision of a man of business , and , just when Mr. Pickwick expected some great outbreak of feeling , dipped a pen in the ink - stand , and said , as quietly as if he were speaking on the most ordinary counting - house topic-- ‘
342539	342540	342541	342542	The George	501	’ ‘
342549	342554	342555	342555	George	501	’ replied that gentleman . ‘
342563	342564	342565	342566	George Yard	727	’ ‘
342571	342572	342565	342566	George Yard	727	’ ‘
342577	342578	342555	342555	George	501	’ ‘
342581	342626	342555	342555	George	501	’ The old gentleman methodically indorsed the address on the back of the letter ; and then , placing it in the desk , which he locked , said , as he got off the stool and put the bunch of keys in his pocket-- ‘
342641	342642	342638	342639	Mr. Pickwick	240	’ ‘
342650	342661	342638	342639	Mr. Pickwick	240	’ observed that warm - hearted person in indignant amazement . ‘
342730	342731	342732	342732	I	0	’ ‘
342736	342742	342732	342732	I	0	’ replied the old gentleman . ‘
342798	342799	342795	342796	Mr. Pickwick	240	’ ‘
342801	342807	342809	342810	Ben Allen	657	’re very right , Sir , ’
342829	342831	342832	342834	an intelligent man	8737	‘ You ’re
342846	342847	342838	342838	he	356	’ ‘
342867	342887	342855	342855	you	9716	’ said Mr. Winkle , senior , looking contemptuously at Ben Allen , who was shaking his head profoundly . ‘
342998	343039	343040	343040	Sir	9716	’ All this time , Bob Sawyer had been nudging Mr. Ben Allen to say something on the right side ; Ben accordingly now burst , without the slightest preliminary notice , into a brief but impassioned piece of eloquence . ‘
343042	343075	343076	343076	you	9716	’ said Mr. Ben Allen , staring at the old gentleman , out of a pair of very dim and languid eyes , and working his right arm vehemently up and down , ‘
343086	343087	343078	343078	you	9716	’ ‘
343105	343112	343096	343096	you	9716	’ retorted Mr. Winkle , senior . ‘
343133	343158	343131	343131	gentlemen	10163	’ With these words the old gentleman took up the candle - stick and opening the room door , politely motioned towards the passage . ‘
343166	343196	343164	343164	Sir	9716	’ said Mr. Pickwick , setting his teeth close together to keep down his choler ; for he felt how important the effect might prove to his young friend . ‘
343206	343214	343197	343197	I	0	’ calmly replied Mr. Winkle , senior . ‘
343228	343599	343220	343220	I	0	’ Mr. Pickwick walked with angry strides into the street . Mr. Bob Sawyer , completely quelled by the decision of the old gentleman ’s manner , took the same course . Mr. Ben Allen ’s hat rolled down the steps immediately afterwards , and Mr. Ben Allen ’s body followed it directly . The whole party went silent and supperless to bed ; and Mr. Pickwick thought , just before he fell asleep , that if he had known Mr. Winkle , senior , had been quite so much of a man of business , it was extremely probable he might never have waited upon him , on such an errand . CHAPTER LI . IN WHICH MR . PICKWICK ENCOUNTERS AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE -- TO WHICH FORTUNATE CIRCUMSTANCE THE READER IS MAINLY INDEBTED FOR MATTER OF THRILLING INTEREST HEREIN SET DOWN , CONCERNING TWO GREAT PUBLIC MEN OF MIGHT AND POWER The morning which broke upon Mr. Pickwick ’s sight at eight o’clock , was not at all calculated to elevate his spirits , or to lessen the depression which the unlooked - for result of his embassy inspired . The sky was dark and gloomy , the air was damp and raw , the streets were wet and sloppy . The smoke hung sluggishly above the chimney - tops as if it lacked the courage to rise , and the rain came slowly and doggedly down , as if it had not even the spirit to pour . A game - cock in the stableyard , deprived of every spark of his accustomed animation , balanced himself dismally on one leg in a corner ; a donkey , moping with drooping head under the narrow roof of an outhouse , appeared from his meditative and miserable countenance to be contemplating suicide . In the street , umbrellas were the only things to be seen , and the clicking of pattens and splashing of rain - drops were the only sounds to be heard . The breakfast was interrupted by very little conversation ; even Mr. Bob Sawyer felt the influence of the weather , and the previous day ’s excitement . In his own expressive language he was ‘
343602	343964	343220	343220	I	0	’ So was Mr. Ben Allen . So was Mr. Pickwick . In protracted expectation of the weather clearing up , the last evening paper from London was read and re - read with an intensity of interest only known in cases of extreme destitution ; every inch of the carpet was walked over with similar perseverance ; the windows were looked out of , often enough to justify the imposition of an additional duty upon them ; all kinds of topics of conversation were started , and failed ; and at length Mr. Pickwick , when noon had arrived , without a change for the better , rang the bell resolutely , and ordered out the chaise . Although the roads were miry , and the drizzling rain came down harder than it had done yet , and although the mud and wet splashed in at the open windows of the carriage to such an extent that the discomfort was almost as great to the pair of insides as to the pair of outsides , still there was something in the motion , and the sense of being up and doing , which was so infinitely superior to being pent in a dull room , looking at the dull rain dripping into a dull street , that they all agreed , on starting , that the change was a great improvement , and wondered how they could possibly have delayed making it as long as they had done . When they stopped to change at Coventry , the steam ascended from the horses in such clouds as wholly to obscure the hostler , whose voice was however heard to declare from the mist , that he expected the first gold medal from the Humane Society on their next distribution of rewards , for taking the postboy ’s hat off ; the water descending from the brim of which , the invisible gentleman declared , must have drowned him ( the postboy ) , but for his great presence of mind in tearing it promptly from his head , and drying the gasping man ’s countenance with a wisp of straw . ‘
343969	343999	344000	344000	Wery	729	’ said Bob Sawyer , turning up his coat collar , and pulling the shawl over his mouth to concentrate the fumes of a glass of brandy just swallowed . ‘
344002	344007	344000	344000	Wery	729	’ replied Sam composedly . ‘

345248	345463	345464	345464	Hollo	303	’ time , a waiter was laying the cloth for dinner , the curtains were drawn , the fire was blazing brightly , and everything looked ( as everything always does , in all decent English inns ) as if the travellers had been expected , and their comforts prepared , for days beforehand . Mr. Pickwick sat down at a side table , and hastily indited a note to Mr. Winkle , merely informing him that he was detained by stress of weather , but would certainly be in London next day ; until when he deferred any account of his proceedings . This note was hastily made into a parcel , and despatched to the bar per Mr. Samuel Weller . Sam left it with the landlady , and was returning to pull his master ’s boots off , after drying himself by the kitchen fire , when glancing casually through a half - opened door , he was arrested by the sight of a gentleman with a sandy head who had a large bundle of newspapers lying on the table before him , and was perusing the leading article of one with a settled sneer which curled up his nose and all other features into a majestic expression of haughty contempt . ‘
345466	345470	345464	345464	Hollo	303	’ said Sam , ‘

345505	345561	345502	345503	a Roman	8796	’ Sam was taken with a troublesome cough , at once , for the purpose of attracting the gentleman ’s attention ; the gentleman starting at the sound , raised his head and his eyeglass , and disclosed to view the profound and thoughtful features of Mr. Pott , of the Eatanswill _ Gazette _ . ‘

Abhorred and despised by even the few who are cognisant of its miserable and disgraceful existence , stifled by the very filth it so profusely scatters , rendered deaf and blind by the exhalations of its own slime , the obscene journal , happily unconscious of its degraded state , is rapidly sinking beneath that treacherous mud which , while it seems to give it a firm standing with the low and debased classes of society , is nevertheless rising above its detested head , and will speedily engulf it for ever . ’
346098	346107	346109	346109	Pott	382	‘ You are a young man , sir , ’
346116	346123	346125	346125	Pott	382	‘ So are you , sir , ’
346138	346173	346175	346175	Pott	382	‘ And are both deeply imbued with those blue principles , which , so long as I live , I have pledged myself to the people of these kingdoms to support and to maintain ? ’

346315	346335	346337	346337	Bob	356	’ I dare say I should turn very blue , long before I got to the end of them , ’
346358	346402	346354	346355	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ You have seen the literary articles which have appeared at intervals in the Eatanswill _ Gazette _ in the course of the last three months , and which have excited such general -- I may say such universal -- attention and admiration ? ’
346403	346406	346408	346409	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Why , ’
346417	346444	346408	346409	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ the fact is , I have been so much engaged in other ways , that I really have not had an opportunity of perusing them . ’
346445	346453	346455	346455	Pott	382	‘ You should do so , Sir , ’
346462	346466	346468	346469	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I will , ’
346471	346490	346492	346492	Pott	382	‘ They appeared in the form of a copious review of a work on Chinese metaphysics , Sir , ’
346494	346497	346492	346492	Pott	382	‘ Oh , ’
346502	346510	346499	346500	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ from your pen , I hope ? ’
346511	346521	346523	346523	Pott	382	‘ From the pen of my critic , Sir , ’
346528	346537	346539	346540	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ An abstruse subject , I should conceive , ’
346542	346547	346549	346549	Pott	382	‘ Very , Sir , ’
346555	346589	346595	346596	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ He _ crammed _ for it , to use a technical but expressive term ; he read up for the subject , at my desire , in the “ Encyclopaedia Britannica . ” ’
346590	346593	346595	346596	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Indeed ! ’
346598	346614	346595	346596	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I was not aware that that valuable work contained any information respecting Chinese metaphysics . ’
346615	346621	346623	346623	Pott	382	‘ He read , Sir , ’
346666	346732	346664	346664	Sir	9716	’ Mr. Pott ’s features assumed so much additional grandeur at the recollection of the power and research displayed in the learned effusions in question , that some minutes elapsed before Mr. Pickwick felt emboldened to renew the conversation ; at length , as the editor ’s countenance gradually relaxed into its customary expression of moral supremacy , he ventured to resume the discourse by asking-- ‘
346749	346750	346664	346664	Sir	9716	’ ‘
346766	346775	346764	346764	Sir	9716	’ replied Pott , with a calm smile : ‘
346781	346790	346792	346793	Mr. Pickwick	240	’ I supposed it was some public mission , ’
346795	346800	346802	346802	Pott	382	‘ Yes , Sir , ’
346804	346808	346802	346802	Pott	382	‘ it is . ’
346825	346842	346816	346816	he	382	‘ A Buff ball , Sir , will take place in Birmingham to - morrow evening . ’

346853	346861	346863	346863	Pott	382	‘ Yes , Sir , and supper , ’
346865	346872	346874	346875	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ You do n’t say so ! ’
346959	347370	346947	346947	himself	382	‘ A reptile contemporary has recently sweltered forth his black venom in the vain and hopeless attempt of sullying the fair name of our distinguished and excellent representative , the Honourable Mr. Slumkey-- that Slumkey whom we , long before he gained his present noble and exalted position , predicted would one day be , as he now is , at once his country ’s brightest honour , and her proudest boast : alike her bold defender and her honest pride -- our reptile contemporary , we say , has made himself merry , at the expense of a superbly embossed plated coal- scuttle , which has been presented to that glorious man by his enraptured constituents , and towards the purchase of which , the nameless wretch insinuates , the Honourable Mr. Slumkey himself contributed , through a confidential friend of his butler ’s , more than three - fourths of the whole sum subscribed . Why , does not the crawling creature see , that even if this be the fact , the Honourable Mr. Slumkey only appears in a still more amiable and radiant light than before , if that be possible ? Does not even his obtuseness perceive that this amiable and touching desire to carry out the wishes of the constituent body , must for ever endear him to the hearts and souls of such of his fellow townsmen as are not worse than swine ; or , in other words , who are not as debased as our contemporary himself ? But such is the wretched trickery of hole - and- corner Buffery ! These are not its only artifices . Treason is abroad . We boldly state , now that we are goaded to the disclosure , and we throw ourselves on the country and its constables for protection -- we boldly state that secret preparations are at this moment in progress for a Buff ball ; which is to be held in a Buff town , in the very heart and centre of a Buff population ; which is to be conducted by a Buff master of the ceremonies ; which is to be attended by four ultra Buff members of Parliament , and the admission to which , is to be by Buff tickets ! Does our fiendish contemporary wince ? Let him writhe , in impotent malice , as we pen the words , _ We will be there _ . ’
347371	347376	347378	347378	Pott	382	‘ There , Sir , ’

348342	348351	348332	348332	you	0	’ said the landlord , venturing a hint . ‘

348382	348387	348380	348380	Sir	9716	’ said the landlord . ‘
348401	348406	348380	348380	Sir	9716	’ interrupted Mr. Slurk . ‘
348414	348439	348409	348409	anybody	851	’ Not a soul . There was a beautiful fire . Everybody had gone , and the house door was closed for the night . ‘
348450	348455	348440	348440	I	0	’ said Mr. Slurk , ‘
348461	348602	348603	348603	I	0	’ So , gathering up his hat and newspaper , he stalked solemnly behind the landlord to that humble apartment , and throwing himself on a settle by the fireside , resumed his countenance of scorn , and began to read and drink in silent dignity . Now , some demon of discord , flying over the Saracen ’s Head at that moment , on casting down his eyes in mere idle curiosity , happened to behold Slurk established comfortably by the kitchen fire , and Pott slightly elevated with wine in another room ; upon which the malicious demon , darting down into the last - mentioned apartment with inconceivable rapidity , passed at once into the head of Mr. Bob Sawyer , and prompted him for his ( the demon ’s ) own evil purpose to speak as follows:-- ‘
348625	348626	348691	348691	you	382	’ ‘
348631	348638	348691	348691	you	382	’ replied Mr. Pickwick , shivering . ‘
348658	348670	348677	348677	I	0	’ said Bob Sawyer , still prompted by the demon aforesaid . ‘
348680	348685	348677	348677	I	0	’ replied Mr. Pickwick . ‘
348694	348751	348691	348691	you	382	’ Mr. Pott yielded a ready assent ; and all four travellers , each with his glass in his hand , at once betook themselves to the kitchen , with Sam Weller heading the procession to show them the way . The stranger was still reading ; he looked up and started . Mr. Pott started . ‘
348757	348762	348763	348764	That reptile	8866	’ whispered Mr. Pickwick . ‘
348766	348770	348763	348764	That reptile	8866	’ replied Pott . ‘
348774	348797	348763	348764	That reptile	8866	’ said Mr. Pickwick , looking about him for fear he should tread on some overgrown black beetle , or dropsical spider . ‘
348801	348818	348763	348764	That reptile	8866	’ whispered Pott , catching Mr. Pickwick by the arm , and pointing towards the stranger . ‘

Whether the representatives of the public feeling of Eatanswill were blinded by animosity , or ( being both acute reasoners ) saw the advantage of having a third party between them to bear all the blows , certain it is that they paid not the slightest attention to Mr. Pickwick , but defying each other with great spirit , plied the carpet - bag and the fire - shovel most fearlessly . Mr. Pickwick would unquestionably have suffered severely for his humane interference , if Mr. Weller , attracted by his master ’s cries , had not rushed in at the moment , and , snatching up a meal - sack , effectually stopped the conflict by drawing it over the head and shoulders of the mighty Pott , and clasping him tight round the shoulders . ‘

355456	355465	355453	355454	Mr. Stiggins	539	‘ it makes a vessel ’s heart bleed ! ’
355492	355500	355502	355503	Mr. Stiggins	539	‘ Do you know , young man , ’
355512	355520	355502	355503	Mr. Stiggins	539	‘ whether she has left Emanuel anything ? ’
355521	355526	355528	355528	Sam	356	‘ Who ’s he ? ’
355530	355534	355536	355537	Mr. Stiggins	539	‘ The chapel , ’
355539	355549	355536	355537	Mr. Stiggins	539	‘ our chapel ; our fold , Mr. Samuel . ’
355550	355569	355571	355571	Sam	356	‘ She has n’t left the fold nothin’ , nor the shepherd nothin’ , nor the animals nothin’ , ’
355574	355580	355571	355571	Sam	356	‘ nor the dogs neither . ’

355630	355637	355639	355639	Stiggins	539	‘ I think there ’s something , ’
355649	355659	355639	355639	Stiggins	539	‘ Consider , Mr. Samuel ; no little token ? ’

355678	355682	355639	355639	Stiggins	539	’ replied Sam . ‘
355685	355695	355608	355608	his	10238	’ said Mr. Stiggins hesitatingly , after a few moments ’
355699	355716	355608	355608	his	10238	‘ perhaps she recommended me to the care of the man of wrath , Mr. Samuel ? ’
355717	355730	355732	355732	Sam	356	‘ I think that ’s wery likely , from what he said , ’
355734	355740	355732	355732	Sam	356	‘ he wos a - speakin ’
355747	355748	355750	355750	he	9004	’ ‘
355754	355761	355750	355750	he	9004	’ exclaimed Stiggins , brightening up . ‘
355803	356132	356133	356133	Sammy	356	’ Heaving a long - drawn sigh , Mr. Stiggins paused for a response . Sam nodded , and Mr. Weller the elder gave vent to an extraordinary sound , which , being neither a groan , nor a grunt , nor a gasp , nor a growl , seemed to partake in some degree of the character of all four . Mr. Stiggins , encouraged by this sound , which he understood to betoken remorse or repentance , looked about him , rubbed his hands , wept , smiled , wept again , and then , walking softly across the room to a well- remembered shelf in one corner , took down a tumbler , and with great deliberation put four lumps of sugar in it . Having got thus far , he looked about him again , and sighed grievously ; with that , he walked softly into the bar , and presently returning with the tumbler half full of pine - apple rum , advanced to the kettle which was singing gaily on the hob , mixed his grog , stirred it , sipped it , sat down , and taking a long and hearty pull at the rum - and - water , stopped for breath . The elder Mr. Weller , who still continued to make various strange and uncouth attempts to appear asleep , offered not a single word during these proceedings ; but when Stiggins stopped for breath , he darted upon him , and snatching the tumbler from his hand , threw the remainder of the rum - and - water in his face , and the glass itself into the grate . Then , seizing the reverend gentleman firmly by the collar , he suddenly fell to kicking him most furiously , accompanying every application of his top- boot to Mr. Stiggins ’s person , with sundry violent and incoherent anathemas upon his limbs , eyes , and body . ‘
356135	356140	356133	356133	Sammy	356	’ said Mr. Weller , ‘
356149	356309	356133	356133	Sammy	356	’ Sam dutifully adjusted the hat with the long hatband more firmly on his father ’s head , and the old gentleman , resuming his kicking with greater agility than before , tumbled with Mr. Stiggins through the bar , and through the passage , out at the front door , and so into the street -- the kicking continuing the whole way , and increasing in vehemence , rather than diminishing , every time the top - boot was lifted . It was a beautiful and exhilarating sight to see the red - nosed man writhing in Mr. Weller ’s grasp , and his whole frame quivering with anguish as kick followed kick in rapid succession ; it was a still more exciting spectacle to behold Mr. Weller , after a powerful struggle , immersing Mr. Stiggins ’s head in a horse - trough full of water , and holding it there , until he was half suffocated . ‘
356312	356342	356133	356133	Sammy	356	’ said Mr. Weller , throwing all his energy into one most complicated kick , as he at length permitted Mr. Stiggins to withdraw his head from the trough , ‘
356347	356384	356133	356133	Sammy	356	’ them lazy shepherds here , and I ’ll pound him to a jelly first , and drownd him artervards ! Sammy , help me in , and fill me a small glass of brandy . I ’m

356504	356509	356511	356512	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ My dear girl , ’
356515	356550	356552	356553	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ it is no fault of yours . It was impossible to foresee that the old gentleman would be so strongly prepossessed against his son ’s marriage , you know . I am sure , ’
356561	356575	356552	356553	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ he can have very little idea of the pleasure he denies himself . ’
356576	356584	356586	356586	Arabella	297	‘ Oh , my dear Mr. Pickwick , ’
356588	356603	356586	356586	Arabella	297	‘ what shall we do , if he continues to be angry with us ? ’
356604	356620	356622	356623	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Why , wait patiently , my dear , until he thinks better of it , ’
356626	356646	356648	356648	Arabella	297	‘ But , dear Mr. Pickwick , what is to become of Nathaniel if his father withdraws his assistance ? ’
356650	356658	356660	356661	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ In that case , my love , ’
356663	356690	356660	356661	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I will venture to prophesy that he will find some other friend who will not be backward in helping him to start in the world . ’
356730	356735	356737	356738	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Come , come , ’
356743	356799	356737	356738	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ we will wait here a few days longer , and see whether he writes or takes any other notice of your husband ’s communication . If not , I have thought of half a dozen plans , any one of which would make you happy at once . There , my dear , there ! ’
356873	356884	356886	356887	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ This is a distressing predicament for these young people , ’
356896	356912	356886	356887	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I ’ll walk up to Perker ’s , and consult him about the matter . ’
357203	357205	357185	357186	the postman	17174	‘ You ’re
357211	357218	357208	357209	Mr. Pickwick	240	’ said a voice behind him . ‘
357224	357238	357221	357222	Mr. Lowten	473	’ replied that gentleman , looking round , and recognising his old acquaintance . ‘
357247	357271	357272	357272	You	240	’ said Lowten , drawing a Bramah key from his pocket , with a small plug therein , to keep the dust out . ‘
357279	357296	357272	357272	You	240	’ rejoined Mr. Pickwick , smiling at the clerk , who was literally red - hot . ‘
357309	357313	357304	357304	I	0	’ replied Lowten . ‘
357327	357340	357342	357342	himself	0	’m here before him , though , so I do n’t mind . ’
357460	357469	357470	357470	he	473	‘ There , you see , Mr. Pickwick , ’
357473	357476	357470	357470	he	473	‘ now I ’m

357540	357570	357538	357538	Lowten	473	‘ Never mind . I ’ll run out presently , and get a bottle of soda . Do n’t I look rather queer about the eyes , Mr. Pickwick ? ’

357626	357647	357587	357587	his	2007	’m rather out of sorts this morning . Perker ’s been about that business of yours , by the bye . ’
357648	357652	357654	357655	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ What business ? ’
357657	357663	357654	357655	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Mrs. Bardell ’s costs ? ’
357664	357673	357675	357676	Mr. Lowten	473	‘ No , I do n’t mean that , ’
357678	357718	357675	357676	Mr. Lowten	473	‘ About getting that customer that we paid the ten shillings in the pound to the bill- discounter for , on your account -- to get him out of the Fleet , you know-- about getting him to Demerara . ’
357719	357725	357727	357728	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Oh , Mr. Jingle , ’
357731	357736	357727	357728	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Yes . Well ? ’
357737	357745	357747	357747	Lowten	473	‘ Well , it ’s all arranged , ’
357753	357785	357747	357747	Lowten	473	‘ The agent at Liverpool said he had been obliged to you many times when you were in business , and he would be glad to take him on your recommendation . ’
357786	357791	357793	357794	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ That ’s well , ’
357796	357804	357793	357794	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I am delighted to hear it . ’
357805	357810	357812	357812	Lowten	473	‘ But I say , ’
357827	357836	357812	357812	Lowten	473	‘ what a soft chap that other is ! ’
357837	357841	357793	357794	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Which other ? ’
357842	357861	357793	357794	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Why , that servant , or friend , or whatever he is ; you know , Trotter . ’
357862	357865	357867	357868	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Ah ! ’
357874	357882	357867	357868	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I always thought him the reverse . ’
357883	357899	357901	357901	Lowten	473	‘ Well , and so did I , from what little I saw of him , ’
357903	357925	357901	357901	Lowten	473	‘ it only shows how one may be deceived . What do you think of his going to Demerara , too ? ’
357926	357938	357940	357941	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ What ! And giving up what was offered him here ! ’
357943	357965	357967	357967	Lowten	473	‘ Treating Perker ’s offer of eighteen bob a week , and a rise if he behaved himself , like dirt , ’
357969	358032	357967	357967	Lowten	473	‘ He said he must go along with the other one , and so they persuaded Perker to write again , and they ’ve got him something on the same estate ; not near so good , Perker says , as a convict would get in New South Wales , if he appeared at his trial in a new suit of clothes . ’
358033	358037	358039	358040	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Foolish fellow , ’
358046	358050	358039	358040	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Foolish fellow . ’
358051	358068	358070	358070	Lowten	473	‘ Oh , it ’s worse than foolish ; it ’s downright sneaking , you know , ’
358080	358183	358184	358185	Mr. Lowten	473	‘ He says that he ’s the only friend he ever had , and he ’s attached to him , and all that . Friendship ’s a very good thing in its way -- we are all very friendly and comfortable at the Stump , for instance , over our grog , where every man pays for himself ; but damn hurting yourself for anybody else , you know ! No man should have more than two attachments -- the first , to number one , and the second to the ladies ; that ’s what I say -- ha ! ha ! ’
358286	358289	358291	358291	Perker	362	‘ Hark ! ’

358315	358321	358323	358324	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ What do you think ? ’
358328	358353	358323	358324	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Yes , I think you had better . Here , you Sir , what ’s your name , walk in , will you ? ’
358381	358384	358386	358386	Perker	362	‘ Well , ’
358388	358396	358386	358386	Perker	362	‘ do n’t you know that gentleman ? ’
358397	358402	358404	358405	Mr. Jingle	419	‘ Good reason to , ’
358410	358433	358404	358405	Mr. Jingle	419	‘ Mr. Pickwick-- deepest obligations -- life preserver -- made a man of me -- you shall never repent it , Sir . ’
358434	358444	358446	358447	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I am happy to hear you say so , ’
358449	358455	358446	358447	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ You look much better . ’
358456	358474	358476	358476	Jingle	419	‘ Thanks to you , sir -- great change -- Majesty ’s Fleet -- unwholesome place-- very , ’
358511	358519	358521	358522	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ When do they go to Liverpool ? ’
358529	358539	358541	358541	Job	419	‘ This evening , Sir , at seven o’clock , ’
358548	358559	358541	358541	Job	419	‘ By the heavy coach from the city , Sir . ’
358560	358566	358521	358522	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Are your places taken ? ’
358567	358573	358575	358575	Job	419	‘ They are , sir , ’
358577	358588	358575	358575	Job	419	‘ You have fully made up your mind to go ? ’
358589	358594	358596	358596	Job	419	‘ I have sir , ’
358598	358611	358613	358613	Perker	362	‘ With regard to such an outfit as was indispensable for Jingle , ’
358620	358687	358613	358613	Perker	362	‘ I have taken upon myself to make an arrangement for the deduction of a small sum from his quarterly salary , which , being made only for one year , and regularly remitted , will provide for that expense . I entirely disapprove of your doing anything for him , my dear sir , which is not dependent on his own exertions and good conduct . ’
358688	358691	358693	358693	Jingle	419	‘ Certainly , ’
358699	358713	358693	358693	Jingle	419	‘ Clear head -- man of the world -- quite right -- perfectly . ’
358714	358740	358742	358742	Perker	362	‘ By compounding with his creditor , releasing his clothes from the pawnbroker ’s , relieving him in prison , and paying for his passage , ’
358750	358760	358742	358742	Perker	362	‘ you have already lost upwards of fifty pounds . ’
358761	358765	358767	358767	Jingle	419	‘ Not lost , ’
358770	358796	358767	358767	Jingle	419	‘ Pay it all -- stick to business -- cash up -- every farthing . Yellow fever , perhaps -- can’t help that -- if not-- ’
358824	358830	358832	358832	Job	419	‘ He means to say , ’
358839	358882	358884	358884	Job	419	‘ that if he is not carried off by the fever , he will pay the money back again . If he lives , he will , Mr. Pickwick . I will see it done . I know he will , Sir , ’
358889	358897	358884	358884	Job	419	‘ I could undertake to swear it . ’
358898	358903	358905	358906	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Well , well , ’
358936	358974	358930	358932	the little attorney	11094	‘ you must be careful not to play any more desperate cricket matches , Mr. Jingle , or to renew your acquaintance with Sir Thomas Blazo , and I have little doubt of your preserving your health . ’
358996	359027	358989	358990	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ You do n’t happen to know , do you , what has become of another friend of yours -- a more humble one , whom I saw at Rochester ? ’
359028	359032	359034	359034	Jingle	419	‘ Dismal Jemmy ? ’
359036	359039	359040	359040	Jingle	419	‘ Yes . ’
359045	359059	359042	359042	his	419	‘ Clever rascal -- queer fellow , hoaxing genius -- Job ’s brother . ’
359060	359065	359067	359068	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Job ’s brother ! ’
359070	359087	359067	359068	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Well , now I look at him closely , there _ is _ a likeness . ’
359088	359099	359101	359101	Job	419	‘ We were always considered like each other , Sir , ’
359116	359160	359101	359101	Job	419	‘ only I was really of a serious nature , and he never was . He emigrated to America , Sir , in consequence of being too much sought after here , to be comfortable ; and has never been heard of since . ’
359161	359200	359202	359203	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ That accounts for my not having received the “ page from the romance of real life , ” which he promised me one morning when he appeared to be contemplating suicide on Rochester Bridge , I suppose , ’
359207	359221	359202	359203	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I need not inquire whether his dismal behaviour was natural or assumed . ’
359222	359230	359232	359232	Job	419	‘ He could assume anything , Sir , ’
359234	359261	359262	359262	Job	419	‘ You may consider yourself very fortunate in having escaped him so easily . On intimate terms he would have been even a more dangerous acquaintance than-- ’
359273	359281	359262	359262	Job	419	‘ than -- than - myself even . ’
359282	359291	359293	359293	Perker	362	‘ A hopeful family yours , Mr. Trotter , ’
359305	359310	359312	359312	Job	419	‘ Yes , Sir , ’
359314	359319	359312	359312	Job	419	‘ Very much so . ’

359331	359420	359325	359327	the little man	2005	‘ I hope you are going to disgrace it . Deliver this letter to the agent when you reach Liverpool , and let me advise you , gentlemen , not to be too knowing in the West Indies . If you throw away this chance , you will both richly deserve to be hanged , as I sincerely trust you will be . And now you had better leave Mr. Pickwick and me alone , for we have other matters to talk over , and time is precious . ’
359535	359540	359542	359542	Perker	362	‘ A worthy couple ! ’
359551	359559	359561	359562	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I hope they may become so , ’
359564	359579	359580	359580	Perker	362	‘ What do you think ? Is there any chance of their permanent reformation ? ’
359597	359665	359667	359667	Perker	362	‘ Of course there is a chance . I hope it may prove a good one . They are unquestionably penitent now ; but then , you know , they have the recollection of very recent suffering fresh upon them . What they may become , when that fades away , is a problem that neither you nor I can solve . However , my dear Sir , ’
359678	359771	359667	359667	Perker	362	‘ your object is equally honourable , whatever the result is . Whether that species of benevolence which is so very cautious and long - sighted that it is seldom exercised at all , lest its owner should be imposed upon , and so wounded in his self - love , be real charity or a worldly counterfeit , I leave to wiser heads than mine to determine . But if those two fellows were to commit a burglary to - morrow , my opinion of this action would be equally high . ’
359816	359822	359824	359824	Perker	362	‘ Give him a week , ’
359831	359840	359842	359843	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Do you think he will come round ? ’
359845	359851	359853	359853	Perker	362	‘ I think he will , ’
359855	359881	359882	359883	Mr. Perker	362	‘ If not , we must try the young lady ’s persuasion ; and that is what anybody but you would have done at first . ’
359928	359932	359934	359936	the little man	2005	‘ Come in ! ’
359954	359960	359962	359962	Perker	362	‘ What ’s the matter ? ’
359964	359966	359962	359962	Perker	362	‘ You ’re
359971	359972	359962	359962	Perker	362	’ ‘
359977	359987	359962	359962	Perker	362	’ Lowten looked at Mr. Pickwick , and coughed . ‘
360000	360001	359997	359998	Mr. Lowten	473	’ ‘
360006	360010	360004	360004	sir	9716	’ replied Lowten , ‘
360021	360022	360016	360016	Fogg	530	’ ‘
360027	360038	360016	360016	Fogg	530	’ said the little man , looking at his watch , ‘
360097	360176	360088	360088	you	9716	’ The next room being the identical room in which Messrs. Dodson & amp ; Fogg were , Mr. Pickwick replied that he would remain where he was : the more especially as Messrs. Dodson & amp ; Fogg ought to be ashamed to look him in the face , instead of his being ashamed to see them . Which latter circumstance he begged Mr. Perker to note , with a glowing countenance and many marks of indignation . ‘
360187	360191	360088	360088	you	9716	’ replied Perker , ‘
360248	360277	360245	360246	Mr. Lowten	473	’ Mr. Lowten disappeared with a grin , and immediately returned ushering in the firm , in due form of precedence -- Dodson first , and Fogg afterwards . ‘
360287	360305	360281	360282	Mr. Pickwick	240	’ said Perker to Dodson , inclining his pen in the direction where that gentleman was seated . ‘
360314	360323	360308	360308	you	240	’ said Dodson , in a loud voice . ‘
360327	360331	360308	360308	you	240	’ cried Fogg , ‘
360355	360407	360348	360348	I	0	’ said Fogg , drawing up a chair , and looking round him with a smile . Mr. Pickwick bent his head very slightly , in answer to these salutations , and , seeing Fogg pull a bundle of papers from his coat pocket , rose and walked to the window . ‘
360421	360443	360418	360419	Mr. Perker	362	’ said Fogg , untying the red tape which encircled the little bundle , and smiling again more sweetly than before . ‘
360470	360471	360468	360468	he	240	’ ‘
360478	360482	360475	360475	I	0	’ said Dodson . ‘
360489	360512	360513	360513	We	9060	’ Then both the partners laughed together -- pleasantly and cheerfully , as men who are going to receive money often do . ‘
360522	360537	360513	360513	We	9060	’ said Fogg , with considerable native humour , as he unfolded his papers . ‘
360559	360600	360556	360557	Mr. Perker	362	’ There was a great comparing of papers , and turning over of leaves , by Fogg and Perker , after this statement of profit and loss . Meanwhile , Dodson said , in an affable manner , to Mr. Pickwick-- ‘
360625	360626	360622	360623	Mr. Pickwick	240	’ ‘
360632	360659	360630	360630	Sir	9716	’ replied Mr. Pickwick , who had been flashing forth looks of fierce indignation , without producing the smallest effect on either of the sharp practitioners ; ‘
360681	360713	360679	360679	Sir	9716	’ Perker coughed violently , and asked Mr. Pickwick whether he would n’t like to look at the morning paper . To which inquiry Mr. Pickwick returned a most decided negative . ‘
360716	360720	360679	360679	Sir	9716	’ said Dodson , ‘
360747	360748	360744	360745	Mr. Pickwick	240	’ ‘
360753	360761	360744	360745	Mr. Pickwick	240	’ replied that much - injured gentleman , ‘
360769	360770	360744	360745	Mr. Pickwick	240	’ ‘
360775	360779	360744	360745	Mr. Pickwick	240	’ said Dodson . ‘
360792	360793	360780	360780	I	0	’ ‘
360796	360894	360780	360780	I	0	’ replied Mr. Pickwick drily . There was a coolness about all this , which , to a gentleman of an excitable temperament , had , under the circumstances , rather an exasperating tendency . Mr. Pickwick restrained his wrath by gigantic efforts ; but when Perker wrote a cheque for the whole amount , and Fogg deposited it in a small pocket - book , with a triumphant smile playing over his pimply features , which communicated itself likewise to the stern countenance of Dodson , he felt the blood in his cheeks tingling with indignation . ‘
360900	360916	360897	360898	Mr. Dodson	447	’ said Fogg , putting up the pocket - book and drawing on his gloves , ‘
360923	360924	360917	360917	I	0	’ ‘
360928	360934	360935	360935	I	0	’ said Dodson , rising ; ‘
360940	360941	360942	360942	I	0	’ ‘
360947	360956	360942	360942	I	0	’ said Fogg , softened by the cheque , ‘
360995	360996	360997	360997	I	0	’ ‘
361001	361013	360997	360997	I	0	’ said Dodson , with the high tone of calumniated virtue . ‘
361083	361084	361092	361092	I	0	’ ‘
361094	361104	361092	361092	I	0	’ said Fogg , in a most forgiving manner . ‘
361110	361114	361092	361092	I	0	’ said Dodson , ‘
361164	361165	361155	361155	I	0	’ ‘
361173	361228	361229	361229	Lowten	473	’ said Fogg . So saying , he put his umbrella under his arm , drew off his right glove , and extended the hand of reconciliation to that most indignant gentleman ; who , thereupon , thrust his hands beneath his coat tails , and eyed the attorney with looks of scornful amazement . ‘
361231	361239	361229	361229	Lowten	473	’ cried Perker , at this moment . ‘
361244	361245	361229	361229	Lowten	473	’ ‘
361250	361255	361256	361256	Perker	362	’ said Mr. Pickwick . ‘
361264	361265	361258	361258	I	0	’ ‘
361279	361299	361300	361301	Mr. Pickwick	240	’ said the little attorney , who had been in a state of nervous apprehension during the whole interview ; ‘
361305	361306	361303	361303	I	0	’ ‘
361316	361322	361314	361314	Sir	9716	’ replied Mr. Pickwick hastily . ‘
361334	361347	361326	361326	you	447	’ Dodson turned round , bent his head meekly , and smiled . ‘
361353	361361	361326	361326	you	447	’ repeated Mr. Pickwick , almost breathless ; ‘
361402	361403	361406	361406	sir	9716	’ ‘
361408	361412	361406	361406	sir	9716	’ exclaimed Dodson . ‘
361417	361421	361415	361415	sir	9716	’ reiterated Fogg . ‘
361437	361442	361444	361444	you	447	’ continued Mr. Pickwick . ‘
361476	361477	361460	361460	you	447	’ ‘
361487	361491	361482	361482	we	9088	’ replied Dodson . ‘
361500	361512	361498	361498	Sir	9716	’ rejoined Fogg , slapping his pocket -- perhaps by accident . ‘
361522	361549	361516	361516	you	447	’ said Mr. Pickwick , attempting to call up a sneer for the first time in his life , and failing most signally in so doing . ‘
361610	361636	361603	361603	I	0	’ said Mr. Pickwick , turning upon Fogg with a fierceness of gesture which caused that person to retreat towards the door with great expedition . ‘
361642	361677	361640	361640	Sir	9716	’ said Dodson , who , though he was the biggest man of the party , had prudently entrenched himself behind Fogg , and was speaking over his head with a very pale face . ‘
361694	361695	361640	361640	Sir	9716	’ ‘
361706	361739	361700	361700	I	0	’ said Fogg , falling back a little more as he spoke ; to the evident relief of his partner , who by these means was gradually getting into the outer office . ‘
361743	361769	361700	361700	I	0	’ continued Mr. Pickwick , resuming the thread of his discourse- -’you are a well - matched pair of mean , rascally , pettifogging robbers . ’
361770	361773	361775	361775	Perker	362	‘ Well , ’
361777	361782	361775	361775	Perker	362	‘ is that all ? ’
361783	361792	361794	361795	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ It is all summed up in that , ’
361797	361807	361794	361795	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ they are mean , rascally , pettifogging robbers . ’
361808	361811	361813	361813	Perker	362	‘ There ! ’
361821	361846	361813	361813	Perker	362	‘ My dear sirs , he has said all he has to say . Now pray go . Lowten , is that door open ? ’
361860	361886	361888	361890	the little man	2005	‘ There , there -- good - morning -- good - morning -- now pray , my dear sirs -- Mr. Lowten , the door ! ’
361907	361939	361897	361897	Fogg	447	‘ this way , my dear sirs -- now pray do n’t prolong this -- Dear me -- Mr. Lowten -- the door , sir -- why do n’t you attend ? ’
361940	361950	361952	361952	Dodson	447	‘ If there ’s law in England , sir , ’
361966	361973	361952	361952	Dodson	447	‘ you shall smart for this . ’
361974	361981	361897	361897	Fogg	447	‘ You are a couple of mean-- ’
361982	361993	361995	361995	Fogg	447	‘ Remember , sir , you pay dearly for this , ’
361997	362003	362005	362006	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ --Rascally , pettifogging robbers ! ’
362022	362025	362027	362028	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Robbers ! ’
362043	362046	362048	362049	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Robbers ! ’
362189	362194	362196	362197	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Well , now , ’
362199	362208	362196	362197	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ let me have a settlement with you . ’
362217	362225	362196	362197	Mr. Pickwick	240	’ inquired Perker , with another laugh . ‘
362229	362251	362196	362197	Mr. Pickwick	240	’ rejoined Mr. Pickwick , drawing out his pocket - book , and shaking the little man heartily by the hand , ‘
362287	362394	362281	362281	I	0	’ With this preface , the two friends dived into some very complicated accounts and vouchers , which , having been duly displayed and gone through by Perker , were at once discharged by Mr. Pickwick with many professions of esteem and friendship . They had no sooner arrived at this point , than a most violent and startling knocking was heard at the door ; it was not an ordinary double- knock , but a constant and uninterrupted succession of the loudest single raps , as if the knocker were endowed with the perpetual motion , or the person outside had forgotten to leave off . ‘
362402	362408	362409	362409	I	0	’ exclaimed Perker , starting . ‘
362419	362466	362409	362409	I	0	’ said Mr. Pickwick , as if there could be the smallest doubt of the fact . The knocker made a more energetic reply than words could have yielded , for it continued to hammer with surprising force and noise , without a moment ’s cessation . ‘
362470	362478	362479	362479	we	9098	’ said Perker , ringing his bell , ‘
362495	362496	362497	362497	I	0	’ ‘
362508	362541	362506	362506	Sir	9716	’ replied the clerk . The knocker appeared to hear the response , and to assert that it was quite impossible he could wait so long . It made a stupendous uproar . ‘
362547	362556	362506	362506	Sir	9716	’ said Mr. Pickwick , stopping his ears . ‘
362563	362568	362560	362561	Mr. Lowten	473	’ Perker called out ; ‘
362577	362746	362569	362569	we	9098	’ Mr. Lowten , who was washing his hands in a dark closet , hurried to the door , and turning the handle , beheld the appearance which is described in the next chapter . CHAPTER LIV . CONTAINING SOME PARTICULARS RELATIVE TO THE DOUBLE KNOCK , AND OTHER MATTERS : AMONG WHICH CERTAIN INTERESTING DISCLOSURES RELATIVE TO MR . SNODGRASS AND A YOUNG LADY ARE BY NO MEANS IRRELEVANT TO THIS HISTORY The object that presented itself to the eyes of the astonished clerk , was a boy -- a wonderfully fat boy -- habited as a serving lad , standing upright on the mat , with his eyes closed as if in sleep . He had never seen such a fat boy , in or out of a travelling caravan ; and this , coupled with the calmness and repose of his appearance , so very different from what was reasonably to have been expected of the inflicter of such knocks , smote him with wonder . ‘
362752	362783	362569	362569	we	9098	’ inquired the clerk . The extraordinary boy replied not a word ; but he nodded once , and seemed , to the clerk ’s imagination , to snore feebly . ‘
362790	362881	362569	362569	we	9098	’ inquired the clerk . The boy made no sign . He breathed heavily , but in all other respects was motionless . The clerk repeated the question thrice , and receiving no answer , prepared to shut the door , when the boy suddenly opened his eyes , winked several times , sneezed once , and raised his hand as if to repeat the knocking . Finding the door open , he stared about him with astonishment , and at length fixed his eyes on Mr. Lowten ’s face . ‘
362893	362899	362886	362886	you	9101	’ inquired the clerk angrily . ‘
362903	362915	362919	362922	forty hackney - coachmen	9102	’ said the boy , in a slow and sleepy voice . ‘
362924	362929	362919	362922	forty hackney - coachmen	9102	’ replied the clerk . ‘
362955	362960	362931	362931	master	3520	’ said the boy . ‘
362963	362968	362931	362931	master	3520	’ said the clerk , ‘
362975	362976	362972	362972	you	9101	’ ‘
362981	362986	362977	362977	He	3520	’ rejoined the boy . ‘
362989	362990	362991	362991	Master	9105	’ ‘
362999	363003	362993	362993	He	9105	’re at home . ’
363053	363065	363067	363067	Lowten	473	‘ That ’s your master in the carriage , I suppose ? ’
363103	363106	363108	363110	the old gentleman	10238	‘ Pickwick ! ’
363112	363151	363108	363110	the old gentleman	10238	‘ Your hand , my boy ! Why have I never heard until the day before yesterday of your suffering yourself to be cooped up in jail ? And why did you let him do it , Perker ? ’
363152	363163	363165	363165	Perker	362	‘ I could n’t help it , my dear Sir , ’
363176	363184	363165	363165	Perker	362	‘ you know how obstinate he is ? ’
363185	363196	363198	363200	the old gentleman	10238	‘ Of course I do ; of course I do , ’
363202	363226	363198	363200	the old gentleman	10238	‘ I am heartily glad to see him , notwithstanding . I will not lose sight of him again , in a hurry . ’
363268	363271	363273	363273	Wardle	294	‘ Well ! ’
363275	363300	363273	363273	Wardle	294	‘ Here are pretty goings on -- a pinch of your snuff , Perker , my boy -- never were such times , eh ? ’
363301	363307	363309	363310	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ What do you mean ? ’
363312	363315	363317	363317	Wardle	294	‘ Mean ! ’
363319	363354	363317	363317	Wardle	294	‘ Why , I think the girls are all running mad ; that ’s no news , you ’ll say ? Perhaps it ’s not ; but it ’s true , for all that . ’
363355	363383	363385	363385	Perker	362	‘ You have not come up to London , of all places in the world , to tell us that , my dear Sir , have you ? ’
363387	363393	363395	363395	Wardle	294	‘ No , not altogether , ’
363397	363412	363395	363395	Wardle	294	‘ though it was the main cause of my coming . How ’s Arabella ? ’
363413	363417	363419	363420	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Very well , ’
363422	363435	363419	363420	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ and will be delighted to see you , I am sure . ’
363436	363443	363445	363445	Wardle	294	‘ Black - eyed little jilt ! ’
363447	363475	363445	363445	Wardle	294	‘ I had a great idea of marrying her myself , one of these odd days . But I am glad of it too , very glad . ’
363476	363484	363486	363487	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ How did the intelligence reach you ? ’
363489	363501	363503	363503	Wardle	294	‘ Oh , it came to my girls , of course , ’
363505	363587	363503	363503	Wardle	294	‘ Arabella wrote , the day before yesterday , to say she had made a stolen match without her husband ’s father ’s consent , and so you had gone down to get it when his refusing it could n’t prevent the match , and all the rest of it . I thought it a very good time to say something serious to my girls ; so I said what a dreadful thing it was that children should marry without their parents ’
363640	363661	363638	363638	himself	241	’ Here the old gentleman stopped to laugh ; and having done so to his heart ’s content , presently resumed-- ‘
363703	363708	363702	363702	they	9117	’re sprung at last . ’
363709	363715	363717	363718	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ What do you mean ? ’
363723	363732	363717	363718	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ no other secret marriage , I hope ? ’
363733	363738	363740	363741	old Wardle	294	‘ No , no , ’
363743	363752	363740	363741	old Wardle	294	‘ not so bad as that ; no . ’
363753	363757	363759	363760	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ What then ? ’
363762	363769	363759	363760	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ am I interested in it ? ’
363770	363779	363781	363781	Wardle	294	‘ Shall I answer that question , Perker ? ’
363783	363798	363781	363781	Wardle	294	‘ If you do n’t commit yourself by doing so , my dear Sir . ’
363799	363806	363808	363808	Wardle	294	‘ Well then , you are , ’
363810	363813	363815	363816	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ How ? ’
363819	363824	363815	363816	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ In what way ? ’
363825	363828	363830	363830	Wardle	294	‘ Really , ’
363832	363834	363830	363830	Wardle	294	‘ you ’re
363870	363901	363866	363866	I	0	’ Having closed the room door , and fortified himself with another application to Perker ’s snuff - box , the old gentleman proceeded with his great disclosure in these words-- ‘
363921	363922	363918	363918	you	240	’ ‘
363930	363936	363918	363918	you	240	’ said Mr. Pickwick impatiently . ‘

364191	364197	364185	364185	I	0	’ interposed Mr. Pickwick warmly . ‘
364201	364205	364185	364185	I	0	’ responded Wardle , ‘

364231	364236	364226	364226	I	0	’ said Mr. Pickwick . ‘

364352	364357	364333	364333	Bella	297	’ Mr. Pickwick started . ‘
364364	364373	364333	364333	Bella	297	’ inquired Wardle , stopping in his narrative . ‘
364376	364381	364333	364333	Bella	297	’ replied Mr. Pickwick . ‘
364386	364387	364388	364388	I	0	’ ‘
364396	364401	364388	364388	I	0	’ said Wardle abruptly . ‘
364605	364646	364597	364597	I	0	’ The testy manner in which the hearty old gentleman uttered this last sentence was not wholly unwarranted ; for Mr. Pickwick ’s face had settled down into an expression of blank amazement and perplexity , quite curious to behold . ‘
364651	364667	364597	364597	I	0	’ were the first broken words that issued from the lips of the confounded gentleman . ‘
364672	364676	364597	364597	I	0	’ replied Wardle ; ‘

364955	364985	364938	364938	I	0	’ interposed Perker , who had accompanied this dialogue with sundry twitchings of his watch - chain , vindictive rubbings of his nose , and other symptoms of impatience . ‘

365259	365268	365255	365255	I	0	’ said Wardle , looking at Mr. Pickwick . ‘
365271	365276	365255	365255	I	0	’ replied that gentleman . ‘

365355	365360	365362	365362	Wardle	294	‘ This is satisfactory , ’

365386	365412	365415	365415	himself	294	‘ I know you both a great deal better than you know yourselves . You have settled it already , to all intents and purposes . ’

368781	368784	368786	368786	Wardle	292	‘ Oh , ’

368946	368950	368952	368953	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Dear me ! ’

368998	369007	369009	369010	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ This is such an extremely singular lad ! ’
369018	369045	369009	369010	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ It seems an odd thing to say , but upon my word I am afraid that , at times , he is a little deranged . ’
369046	369058	369060	369060	Emily	294	‘ Oh ! Mr. Pickwick , pray do n’t say so , ’
369068	369077	369079	369080	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I am not certain , of course , ’
369091	369106	369108	369109	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ but his manner to me this moment really was very alarming . Oh ! ’
369119	369147	369108	369109	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I beg your pardon , ladies , but at that moment he ran some sharp instrument into my leg . Really , he is not safe . ’
369148	369153	369155	369156	old Wardle	292	‘ He ’s drunk , ’

369244	369262	369264	369264	Wardle	292	‘ Then , what the devil did you run sharp instruments into Mr. Pickwick ’s legs for ? ’
369267	369275	369277	369278	the boy	1304	‘ He would n’t look at me , ’
369280	369288	369277	369278	the boy	1304	‘ I wanted to speak to him . ’
369289	369297	369236	369238	the fat boy	1437	‘ What did you want to say ? ’
369334	369342	369344	369344	Wardle	292	‘ What did you want to say ? ’
369349	369352	369354	369355	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Stop ! ’
369357	369374	369354	369355	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ allow me . What did you wish to communicate to me , my poor boy ? ’
369375	369383	369385	369387	the fat boy	1437	‘ I want to whisper to you , ’
369389	369401	369403	369403	Wardle	292	‘ You want to bite his ear off , I suppose , ’
369405	369427	369403	369403	Wardle	292	‘ Do n’t come near him ; he ’s vicious ; ring the bell , and let him be taken downstairs . ’
369477	369480	369482	369482	Wardle	292	‘ Hollo ! ’
369495	369500	369482	369482	Wardle	292	‘ What ’s this ? ’
369501	369517	369519	369520	Mr. Snodgrass	242	‘ I have been concealed in the next room , sir , since you returned , ’
369522	369528	369530	369530	Wardle	292	‘ Emily , my girl , ’
369533	369563	369530	369530	Wardle	292	‘ I detest meanness and deceit ; this is unjustifiable and indelicate in the highest degree . I do n’t deserve this at your hands , Emily , indeed ! ’
369564	369568	369570	369570	Emily	294	‘ Dear papa , ’
369572	369602	369570	369570	Emily	294	‘ Arabella knows -- everybody here knows -- Joe knows -- that I was no party to this concealment . Augustus , for Heaven ’s sake , explain it ! ’
369793	369796	369798	369798	Wardle	292	‘ Stop ! ’
369800	369809	369798	369798	Wardle	292	‘ Why , in the name of all that’s-- ’
369810	369813	369816	369817	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Inflammable , ’
369826	369833	369835	369835	Wardle	292	‘ Well -- that ’s inflammable , ’
369841	369855	369835	369835	Wardle	292	‘ could n’t you say all this to me in the first instance ? ’
369856	369862	369864	369865	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Or confide in me ? ’
369867	369872	369874	369874	Arabella	297	‘ Dear , dear , ’
369881	369944	369874	369874	Arabella	297	‘ what is the use of asking all that now , especially when you know you had set your covetous old heart on a richer son - in - law , and are so wild and fierce besides , that everybody is afraid of you , except me ? Shake hands with him , and order him some dinner , for goodness gracious ’
369977	370011	370012	370012	She	297	’ The worthy old gentleman pulled Arabella ’s ear , kissed her without the smallest scruple , kissed his daughter also with great affection , and shook Mr. Snodgrass warmly by the hand . ‘
370022	370029	370012	370012	She	297	’ said the old gentleman cheerfully . ‘
370035	370179	370181	370182	Mr. Weller	493	’ The wine came , and Perker came upstairs at the same moment . Mr. Snodgrass had dinner at a side table , and , when he had despatched it , drew his chair next Emily , without the smallest opposition on the old gentleman ’s part . The evening was excellent . Little Mr. Perker came out wonderfully , told various comic stories , and sang a serious song which was almost as funny as the anecdotes . Arabella was very charming , Mr. Wardle very jovial , Mr. Pickwick very harmonious , Mr. Ben Allen very uproarious , the lovers very silent , Mr. Winkle very talkative , and all of them very happy .

Mrs. Pell was a very elegant and accomplished woman ; her manners were the theme of universal admiration in our neighbourhood . I was proud to see that woman dance ; there was something so firm and dignified , and yet natural , in her motion . Her cutting , gentlemen , was simplicity itself . Ah ! well , well ! Excuse my asking the question , Mr. Samuel , ’
372567	372577	372560	372561	the attorney	1938	‘ was your mother - in - law tall ? ’

This important point being despatched , Mr. Pell refreshed himself with three chops , and liquids both malt and spirituous , at the expense of the estate ; and then they all went away to Doctors ’

373590	373610	373582	373582	Pell	689	‘ If we are with Mr. Flasher at a quarter past , we shall just hit the best time . ’

373722	373800	373716	373716	Sammy	240	’ Sammy complied ; and the porter , cold beef , and oysters being promptly produced , the lunch was done ample justice to . Where everybody took so active a part , it is almost invidious to make a distinction ; but if one individual evinced greater powers than another , it was the coachman with the hoarse voice , who took an imperial pint of vinegar with his oysters , without betraying the least emotion . ‘
373806	373860	373804	373804	Sir	9716	’ said the elder Mr. Weller , stirring a glass of brandy- and - water , of which one was placed before every gentleman when the oyster shells were removed--‘Mr . Pell , Sir , it wos my intention to have proposed the funs on this occasion , but Samivel has vispered to me-- ’
373878	373881	373862	373864	Mr. Samuel Weller	356	‘ Hear ! ’

373942	373947	373949	373953	the mottled - faced gentleman	16354	‘ Hold hard there , ’

Upon this hint Mr. Weller settled the bill , and , issuing forth , the executor , legatee , attorney , and umpires , directed their steps towards the city . The office of Wilkins Flasher , Esquire , of the Stock Exchange , was in a first floor up a court behind the Bank of England ; the house of Wilkins Flasher , Esquire , was at Brixton , Surrey ; the horse and stanhope of Wilkins Flasher , Esquire , were at an adjacent livery stable ; the groom of Wilkins Flasher , Esquire , was on his way to the West End to deliver some game ; the clerk of Wilkins Flasher , Esquire , had gone to his dinner ; and so Wilkins Flasher , Esquire , himself , cried , ‘
374507	374522	374325	374325	Your	9389	’ when Mr. Pell and his companions knocked at the counting - house door . ‘
374529	374536	374527	374527	Sir	9716	’ said Pell , bowing obsequiously . ‘

374602	374661	374599	374600	Mr. Weller	356	’ Mr. Weller took a chair , and Sam took a box , and the umpires took what they could get , and looked at the almanac and one or two papers which were wafered against the wall , with as much open - eyed reverence as if they had been the finest efforts of the old masters . ‘
374678	374823	374824	374824	I	0	’ said Wilkins Flasher , Esquire , resuming the conversation to which Mr. Pell ’s entrance had caused a momentary interruption . This was addressed to a very smart young gentleman who wore his hat on his right whisker , and was lounging over the desk , killing flies with a ruler . Wilkins Flasher , Esquire , was balancing himself on two legs of an office stool , spearing a wafer - box with a penknife , which he dropped every now and then with great dexterity into the very centre of a small red wafer that was stuck outside . Both gentlemen had very open waistcoats and very rolling collars , and very small boots , and very big rings , and very little watches , and very large guard - chains , and symmetrical inexpressibles , and scented pocket - handkerchiefs . ‘
374831	374837	374838	374838	I	0	’ said the other gentleman . ‘

374874	374919	374920	374920	I	0	’ replied Wilkins Flasher , Esquire . Wilkins Flasher , Esquire , entered it in a little book , with a gold pencil - case , and the other gentleman entered it also , in another little book with another gold pencil - case . ‘
374932	374937	374930	374930	Boffer	754	’ observed Mr. Simmery . ‘

375091	375098	375083	375083	we	9406	’ suggested Wilkins Flasher , Esquire . ‘
375106	375123	375083	375083	we	9406	’ rejoined Mr. Simmery , stopping for an instant to smash a fly with the ruler . ‘
375128	375129	375083	375083	we	9406	’ ‘
375134	375141	375083	375083	we	9406	’ said Wilkins Flasher , Esquire . ‘

So it was entered down on the little books that Boffer was to kill himself within ten days , or Wilkins Flasher , Esquire , was to hand over to Frank Simmery , Esquire , the sum of ten guineas ; and that if Boffer did kill himself within that time , Frank Simmery , Esquire , would pay to Wilkins Flasher , Esquire , five guineas , instead . ‘

375264	375289	375261	375262	Mr. Simmery	753	‘ We are going to send our butler to the sale to - morrow , to pick up some of that sixty - four . ’

375763	375778	375761	375761	Sir	9716	’ inquired Mr. Weller , directing Pell ’s attention to the target in question . ‘

376199	376345	376385	376385	Samivel	493	’ A quiet room was soon found , and the accounts were produced and audited . Mr. Pell ’s bill was taxed by Sam , and some charges were disallowed by the umpires ; but , notwithstanding Mr. Pell ’s declaration , accompanied with many solemn asseverations that they were really too hard upon him , it was by very many degrees the best professional job he had ever had , and one on which he boarded , lodged , and washed , for six months afterwards . The umpires having partaken of a dram , shook hands and departed , as they had to drive out of town that night . Mr. Solomon Pell , finding that nothing more was going forward , either in the eating or drinking way , took a friendly leave , and Sam and his father were left alone . ‘
376348	376363	376385	376385	Samivel	493	’ said Mr. Weller , thrusting his pocket - book in his side pocket . ‘

376493	376515	376475	376475	Mary	307	‘ Oh , if you please , Sir , Samuel is downstairs , and he says may his father see you ? ’
376516	376519	376521	376522	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Surely , ’
376524	376530	376532	376532	Mary	307	‘ Thank you , Sir , ’
376540	376551	376553	376554	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Sam has not been here long , has he ? ’
376556	376563	376565	376565	Mary	307	‘ Oh , no , Sir , ’
376568	376593	376565	376565	Mary	307	‘ He has only just come home . He is not going to ask you for any more leave , Sir , he says . ’
376666	376680	376682	376683	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Tell them they can come up at once , by all means , ’
376729	376734	376736	376737	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Well , well , ’
376749	376819	376821	376822	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ it is the best way in which I could reward him for his attachment and fidelity ; let it be so , in Heaven ’s name . It is the fate of a lonely old man , that those about him should form new and different attachments and leave him . I have no right to expect that it should be otherwise with me . No , no , ’
376826	376858	376821	376822	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ it would be selfish and ungrateful . I ought to be happy to have an opportunity of providing for him so well . I am . Of course I am . ’
376914	376924	376926	376927	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Glad to see you back again , Sam , ’
376929	376938	376926	376927	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ How do you do , Mr. Weller ? ’
376939	376947	376949	376950	the widower	4212	‘ Wery hearty , thank’ee , sir , ’
376952	376961	376949	376950	the widower	4212	‘ hope I see you well , sir . ’

377061	377079	377059	377059	sir	9716	’ added the old gentleman , laying his hat on the floor as he sat himself down . ‘
377085	377090	377059	377059	sir	9716	’ replied Mr. Pickwick . ‘

377104	377202	377102	377102	sir	9716	’ rejoined Mr. Weller . Here , the old gentleman was seized with a violent fit of coughing , which , being terminated , he nodded his head and winked and made several supplicatory and threatening gestures to his son , all of which Sam Weller steadily abstained from seeing . Mr. Pickwick , perceiving that there was some embarrassment on the old gentleman ’s part , affected to be engaged in cutting the leaves of a book that lay beside him , and waited patiently until Mr. Weller should arrive at the object of his visit . ‘

377524	377556	377518	377518	Wery	9456	’ Mr. Weller nodded his head an extraordinary number of times , in the excess of his gratification , and waited in a listening attitude for Sam to resume his statement . ‘
377564	377598	377562	377562	Sam	240	’ said Mr. Pickwick , apprehending that the interview was likely to prove rather longer than he had expected . Sam bowed again and sat down ; his father looking round , he continued-- ‘
377613	377614	377599	377600	The gov’nor	15751	’ ‘
377618	377629	377599	377600	The gov’nor	15751	’ interposed Mr. Weller , senior , in an undertone . ‘
377645	377649	377599	377600	The gov’nor	15751	’ said Sam ; ‘

377789	377798	377799	377799	he	493	’ said Sam , with a little hesitation , ‘

378108	378150	378152	378152	him	9467	’ With these words , Mr. Weller placed the pocket - book in Mr. Pickwick ’s hands , caught up his hat , and ran out of the room with a celerity scarcely to be expected from so corpulent a subject . ‘
378156	378162	378164	378164	him	9467	’ exclaimed Mr. Pickwick earnestly . ‘
378179	378215	378216	378218	My good friend	9468	’ Sam saw that his master ’s injunctions were not to be disobeyed ; and , catching his father by the arm as he was descending the stairs , dragged him back by main force . ‘

378301	378315	378317	378318	Mr. Weller	493	‘ No man knows how much he can spend , till he tries , ’
378320	378324	378326	378327	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Perhaps not , ’
378329	378363	378326	378327	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ but as I have no intention of trying any such experiments , I am not likely to come to want . I must beg you to take this back , Mr. Weller . ’

378404	378428	378399	378399	You	493	’ replied Sam . Mr. Weller reflected for a short time , and then , buttoning up his coat with great determination , said-- ‘

378485	378528	378474	378474	I	0	’ This threat was such an awful one , and Mr. Weller , besides appearing fully resolved to carry it into execution , seemed so deeply mortified by Mr. Pickwick ’s refusal , that that gentleman , after a short reflection , said-- ‘

378567	378575	378542	378542	I	0	’ said Mr. Weller , brightening up ; ‘

378687	378699	378701	378702	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Wait outside a few minutes , Sam , will you ? ’
378726	378741	378719	378720	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ You are not an advocate for matrimony , I think , Mr. Weller ? ’
378775	378795	378797	378798	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Did you happen to see a young girl downstairs when you came in just now with your son ? ’

378838	378850	378852	378853	Mr. Weller	493	‘ I thought she wos wery plump , and vell made , ’
378860	378865	378867	378868	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ So she is , ’
378870	378890	378867	378868	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ so she is . What did you think of her manners , from what you saw of her ? ’
378891	378895	378897	378898	Mr. Weller	493	‘ Wery pleasant , ’

378984	378994	378996	378997	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I mean an interest in her doing well , ’
378999	379013	378996	378997	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ a desire that she may be comfortable and prosperous . You understand ? ’
379014	379018	379020	379021	Mr. Weller	493	‘ Wery clearly , ’
379028	379033	379035	379036	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ That young person , ’

379234	379266	379231	379232	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ but I had better do so at once . This young person is not only attached to your son , Mr. Weller , but your son is attached to her . ’

379370	379509	379510	379510	Sam	240	’ At first , Mr. Weller received with wry faces a proposition involving the marriage of anybody in whom he took an interest ; but , as Mr. Pickwick argued the point with him , and laid great stress on the fact that Mary was not a widow , he gradually became more tractable . Mr. Pickwick had great influence over him , and he had been much struck with Mary ’s appearance ; having , in fact , bestowed several very unfatherly winks upon her , already . At length he said that it was not for him to oppose Mr. Pickwick ’s inclination , and that he would be very happy to yield to his advice ; upon which , Mr. Pickwick joyfully took him at his word , and called Sam back into the room . ‘
379512	379521	379510	379510	Sam	240	’ said Mr. Pickwick , clearing his throat , ‘

379600	379615	379594	379594	You	240	’ said Mr. Weller , in the same judicial form of speech as before . ‘
379621	379629	379619	379619	Sir	9716	’ said Sam , addressing his master , ‘

380118	380138	380140	380141	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I speak after long deliberation , Sam , and with the certainty that I shall keep my word , ’

380331	380336	380338	380339	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ My good fellow , ’
380356	380367	380352	380352	his	12836	‘ you are bound to consider the young woman also . ’
380368	380374	380338	380339	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I do consider the young ‘
380379	380383	380377	380377	Sir	9716	’ said Sam . ‘
380389	380404	380352	380352	his	12836	‘ ooman . I ’ve spoke to her . I ’ve told her how I ’m

380469	380589	380591	380591	she	9500	’ Who could combat this resolution ? Not Mr. Pickwick . He derived , at that moment , more pride and luxury of feeling from the disinterested attachment of his humble friends , than ten thousand protestations from the greatest men living could have awakened in his heart . While this conversation was passing in Mr. Pickwick ’s room , a little old gentleman in a suit of snuff - coloured clothes , followed by a porter carrying a small portmanteau , presented himself below ; and , after securing a bed for the night , inquired of the waiter whether one Mrs. Winkle was staying there , to which question the waiter of course responded in the affirmative . ‘
380594	380600	380601	380601	I	0	’ inquired the old gentleman . ‘
380608	380613	380606	380606	Sir	9716	’ replied the waiter ; ‘
380625	380626	380624	380624	you--	9716	’ ‘
380635	380642	380629	380629	I	0	’ said the old gentleman quickly . ‘
380652	380653	380629	380629	I	0	’ ‘
380658	380663	380656	380656	Sir	9716	’ said the waiter . ‘
380668	380675	380678	380678	sir	9716	’ inquired the little old gentleman . ‘
380680	380681	380678	380678	sir	9716	’ ‘
380695	380696	380690	380690	you	9716	’ ‘

380719	380745	380710	380711	Mrs. Winkle	718	’ As the little old gentleman uttered this command , he slipped five shillings into the waiter ’s hand , and looked steadily at him . ‘
380750	380755	380748	380748	sir	9716	’ said the waiter , ‘
380764	380765	380768	380768	you	9716	’ ‘
380776	380783	380773	380773	I	0	’ said the little old gentleman . ‘
380797	380831	380773	380773	I	0	’ There was something so very cool and collected in the gentleman ’s manner , that the waiter put the five shillings in his pocket , and led him upstairs without another word . ‘
380840	380845	380846	380846	You	9716	’ said the gentleman . ‘
380850	380886	380846	380846	You	9716	’ The waiter complied , wondering much who the gentleman could be , and what he wanted ; the little old gentleman , waiting till he was out of sight , tapped at the door . ‘
380890	380894	380846	380846	You	9716	’ said Arabella . ‘
380905	380912	380846	380846	You	9716	’ murmured the little old gentleman ; ‘
380918	380957	380846	380846	You	9716	’ As he said this , he opened the door and walked in . Arabella , who was sitting at work , rose on beholding a stranger -- a little confused -- but by no means ungracefully so . ‘
380965	380980	380963	380963	ma’am	10369	’ said the unknown , walking in , and closing the door after him . ‘
380987	380993	380981	380982	Mrs. Winkle	718	’ Arabella inclined her head . ‘
381009	381040	380994	380996	Mrs. Nathaniel Winkle	718	’ said the stranger , eyeing Arabella with visible curiosity . Again Arabella inclined her head , and looked uneasily round , as if uncertain whether to call for assistance . ‘
381050	381056	381045	381045	I	0	’ said the old gentleman . ‘
381062	381071	381059	381059	I	0	’ replied Arabella , wondering more and more . ‘
381086	381120	381079	381079	you	10369	’ said the stranger . He took one ; and drawing a spectacle - case from his pocket , leisurely pulled out a pair of spectacles , which he adjusted on his nose . ‘
381129	381145	381121	381121	You	10369	’ he said , looking so intently at Arabella that she began to feel alarmed . ‘
381150	381155	381148	381148	sir	9716	’ she replied timidly . ‘
381158	381168	381169	381169	I	0	’ said the gentleman , nursing his left leg ; ‘
381186	381187	381177	381177	You	10369	’ ‘
381191	381203	381189	381189	I	0	’ said Arabella , trembling , though she scarcely knew why . ‘
381211	381212	381215	381215	ma’am	10369	’ ‘
381219	381234	381215	381215	ma’am	10369	’ said the stranger , not having yet removed his eyes from her countenance . ‘
381243	381244	381245	381245	I	0	’ ‘
381248	381285	381245	381245	I	0	’ replied Arabella , in a scarcely audible tone , laying aside her work , and becoming greatly agitated as a thought , that had occurred to her before , struck more forcibly upon her mind . ‘
381309	381322	381306	381306	I	0	’ said the stranger . Arabella applied her handkerchief to her eyes . ‘
381356	381361	381362	381362	I	0	’ said the stranger . ‘
381370	381374	381362	381362	I	0	’ said Arabella . ‘
381414	381420	381426	381426	girls	10335	’ said the old gentleman . ‘
381454	381508	381443	381443	they	9531	’ Arabella ’s tears flowed fast , as she pleaded in extenuation that she was young and inexperienced ; that her attachment had alone induced her to take the step to which she had resorted ; and that she had been deprived of the counsel and guidance of her parents almost from infancy . ‘
381513	381523	381443	381443	they	9531	’ said the old gentleman in a milder tone , ‘
381535	381536	381443	381443	they	9531	’ ‘
381548	381555	381546	381546	Sir	9716	’ replied poor Arabella , weeping . ‘
381558	381564	381546	381546	Sir	9716	’ said the old gentleman ; ‘
381587	381599	381602	381602	your	0	’ said the old gentleman , looking rather slily at Arabella . ‘
381611	381659	381605	381605	He	9716	’ This little compliment , or the little gentleman ’s odd way of paying it , or his altered manner -- so much kinder than it was , at first -- or all three together , forced a smile from Arabella in the midst of her tears . ‘
381665	381685	381686	381686	I	0	’ inquired the old gentleman , abruptly ; stopping a smile which was just coming over his own face . ‘
381694	381698	381688	381688	him	17793	’ said Arabella . ‘
381723	381724	381728	381728	he	17793	’ ‘
381730	381736	381728	381728	he	17793	’ said the old gentlemen . ‘
381741	381742	381743	381743	He	17793	’ ‘
381754	381758	381743	381743	He	17793	’ said Arabella ; ‘
381785	381786	381771	381771	I	0	’ ‘
381798	381804	381771	381771	I	0	’ said the old gentleman . ‘
381828	381888	381889	381889	Father	10519	’ The words were scarcely out of the old gentleman ’s lips , when footsteps were heard ascending the stairs , which he and Arabella seemed both to recognise at the same moment . The little gentleman turned pale ; and , making a strong effort to appear composed , stood up , as Mr. Winkle entered the room . ‘
381891	381900	381889	381889	Father	10519	’ cried Mr. Winkle , recoiling in amazement . ‘
381905	381912	381903	381903	sir	9716	’ replied the little old gentleman . ‘
381926	381932	381919	381919	you	9716	’ Mr. Winkle remained silent . ‘
381944	381956	381939	381939	I	0	’ said the old gentleman . Still Mr. Winkle said nothing . ‘
381970	381976	381939	381939	I	0	’ inquired the old gentleman . ‘
381981	381993	381979	381979	Sir	9716	’ replied Mr. Winkle , drawing Arabella ’s arm through his . ‘
382007	382008	382010	382010	my	0	’ ‘
382013	382020	382010	382010	my	0	’ cried the old gentleman ironically . ‘
382039	382044	382037	382037	Sir	9716	’ said Mr. Winkle ; ‘
382080	382081	382084	382084	your	0	’ ‘
382089	382100	382087	382087	Nat	276	’ said the old gentleman , in an altered voice . ‘
382121	382126	382128	382129	Mr. Winkle	276	’ In a few minutes ’
382158	382175	382177	382179	old Mr. Winkle	276	‘ Mr. Pickwick , I thank you most heartily for all your kindness to my son , ’
382188	382233	382177	382179	old Mr. Winkle	276	‘ I am a hasty fellow , and when I saw you last , I was vexed and taken by surprise . I have judged for myself now , and am more than satisfied . Shall I make any more apologies , Mr. Pickwick ? ’
382234	382238	382240	382241	that gentleman	9760	‘ Not one , ’
382243	382256	382240	382241	that gentleman	9760	‘ You have done the only thing wanting to complete my happiness . ’
382334	382338	382340	382340	Joe	241	‘ I say , ’
382347	382371	382340	382340	Joe	241	‘ what a pretty girl Mary is , is n’t she ? I am _ so _ fond of her , I am ! ’
382687	382695	382697	382699	the old gentleman	10238	‘ We are all anxious to know , ’
382701	382725	382697	382699	the old gentleman	10238	‘ what we have done to offend you , and to induce you to desert us and devote yourself to these solitary walks . ’
382726	382730	382732	382733	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ Are you ? ’
382735	382771	382732	382733	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ It is singular enough that I had intended to volunteer a full explanation this very day ; so , if you will give me another glass of wine , I will satisfy your curiosity . ’
382801	382812	382814	382815	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ All the changes that have taken place among us , ’
382817	382946	382814	382815	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I mean the marriage that _ has _ taken place , and the marriage that WILL take place , with the changes they involve , rendered it necessary for me to think , soberly and at once , upon my future plans . I determined on retiring to some quiet , pretty neighbourhood in the vicinity of London ; I saw a house which exactly suited my fancy ; I have taken it and furnished it . It is fully prepared for my reception , and I intend entering upon it at once , trusting that I may yet live to spend many quiet years in peaceful retirement , cheered through life by the society of my friends , and followed in death by their affectionate remembrance . ’
382961	382968	382970	382971	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ The house I have taken , ’
382973	383118	383120	383121	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ is at Dulwich . It has a large garden , and is situated in one of the most pleasant spots near London . It has been fitted up with every attention to substantial comfort ; perhaps to a little elegance besides ; but of that you shall judge for yourselves . Sam accompanies me there . I have engaged , on Perker ’s representation , a housekeeper -- a very old one -- and such other servants as she thinks I shall require . I propose to consecrate this little retreat , by having a ceremony in which I take a great interest , performed there . I wish , if my friend Wardle entertains no objection , that his daughter should be married from my new house , on the day I take possession of it . The happiness of young people , ’
383127	383161	383120	383121	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ has ever been the chief pleasure of my life . It will warm my heart to witness the happiness of those friends who are dearest to me , beneath my own roof . ’
383173	383188	383190	383191	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ I have communicated , both personally and by letter , with the club , ’
383193	383239	383190	383191	Mr. Pickwick	240	‘ acquainting them with my intention . During our long absence , it has suffered much from internal dissentions ; and the withdrawal of my name , coupled with this and other circumstances , has occasioned its dissolution . The Pickwick Club exists no longer . ‘
383245	383254	383255	383255	I	0	’ said Mr. Pickwick in a low voice , ‘
383384	383898	383381	383381	you	9573	’ With these words , Mr. Pickwick filled and drained a bumper with a trembling hand ; and his eyes moistened as his friends rose with one accord , and pledged him from their hearts . There were few preparatory arrangements to be made for the marriage of Mr. Snodgrass . As he had neither father nor mother , and had been in his minority a ward of Mr. Pickwick ’s , that gentleman was perfectly well acquainted with his possessions and prospects . His account of both was quite satisfactory to Wardle -- as almost any other account would have been , for the good old gentleman was overflowing with hilarity and kindness -- and a handsome portion having been bestowed upon Emily , the marriage was fixed to take place on the fourth day from that time -- the suddenness of which preparations reduced three dressmakers and a tailor to the extreme verge of insanity . Getting post - horses to the carriage , old Wardle started off , next day , to bring his mother back to town . Communicating his intelligence to the old lady with characteristic impetuosity , she instantly fainted away ; but being promptly revived , ordered the brocaded silk gown to be packed up forthwith , and proceeded to relate some circumstances of a similar nature attending the marriage of the eldest daughter of Lady Tollimglower , deceased , which occupied three hours in the recital , and were not half finished at last . Mrs. Trundle had to be informed of all the mighty preparations that were making in London ; and , being in a delicate state of health , was informed thereof through Mr. Trundle , lest the news should be too much for her ; but it was not too much for her , inasmuch as she at once wrote off to Muggleton , to order a new cap and a black satin gown , and moreover avowed her determination of being present at the ceremony . Hereupon , Mr. Trundle called in the doctor , and the doctor said Mrs. Trundle ought to know best how she felt herself , to which Mrs. Trundle replied that she felt herself quite equal to it , and that she had made up her mind to go ; upon which the doctor , who was a wise and discreet doctor , and knew what was good for himself , as well as for other people , said that perhaps if Mrs. Trundle stopped at home , she might hurt herself more by fretting , than by going , so perhaps she had better go . And she did go ; the doctor with great attention sending in half a dozen of medicine , to be drunk upon the road . In addition to these points of distraction , Wardle was intrusted with two small letters to two small young ladies who were to act as bridesmaids ; upon the receipt of which , the two young ladies were driven to despair by having no ‘
