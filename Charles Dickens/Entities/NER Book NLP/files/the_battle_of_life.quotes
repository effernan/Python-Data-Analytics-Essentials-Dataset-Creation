4361	4397	4351	4352	Mr. Snitchey	24	" was wrong , Doctor Jeddler ; and your philosophy is altogether wrong , depend upon it , as I have often told you . Nothing serious in life ! What do you call law ? "

Yet not a hundred people in that battle , knew for what they fought , or why ; not a hundred of the inconsiderate rejoicers in the victory , why they rejoiced . Not half a hundred people were the better , for the gain or loss . Not half - a - dozen men agree to this hour on the cause or merits ; and nobody , in short , ever knew anything distinct about it , but the mourners of the slain . Serious , too ! "

I was born upon this battle - field . I began , as a boy , to have my thoughts directed to the real history of a battle - field . Sixty years have gone over my head ; and I have never seen the Christian world , including Heaven knows how many loving mothers and good enough girls , like mine here , anything but mad for a battle - field .

33468	33531	33458	33458	Grace	14	" there is something in this letter -- this old letter , which you say I read so often -- that I have never told you .

I know why Grace , although so true a friend to me , was hard to win to be my wife . And knowing it , my own !

It is . Tell me that you have present fortitude to bear a trial -- a surprise -- a shock : and the messenger is waiting at the gate . "
34101	34105	34106	34106	she	540	" What messenger ? "

34709	34860	34861	34862	Her sister	181	" When this was my dear home , Grace , as it will be now , again , I loved him from my soul . I loved him most devotedly . I would have died for him , though I was so young . I never slighted his affection in my secret breast , for one brief instant . It was far beyond all price to me . Although it is so long ago , and past and gone , and everything is wholly changed , I could not bear to think that you , who love so well , should think I did not truly love him once . I never loved him better , Grace , than when he left this very scene upon this very day . I never loved him better , dear one , than I did that night when _ I _ left here . "
34880	34888	34890	34890	Marion	15	" But he had gained , unconsciously , "
34897	35282	34890	34890	Marion	15	" another heart , before I knew that I had one to give him . That heart -- yours , my sister -- was so yielded up , in all its other tenderness , to me ; was so devoted , and so noble ; that it plucked its love away , and kept its secret from all eyes but mine -- Ah ! what other eyes were quickened by such tenderness and gratitude!--and was content to sacrifice itself to me . But I knew something of its depths . I knew the struggle it had made . I knew its high , inestimable worth to him , and his appreciation of it , let him love me as he would . I knew the debt I owed it . I had its great example every day before me . What you had done for me , I knew that I could do , Grace , if I would , for you . I never laid my head down on my pillow , but I prayed with tears to do it . I never laid my head down on my pillow , but I thought of Alfred 's own words , on the day of his departure , and how truly he had said ( for I knew that , by you ) that there were victories gained every day , in struggling hearts , to which these fields of battle were as nothing . Thinking more and more upon the great endurance cheerfully sustained , and never known or cared for , that there must be every day and hour , in that great strife of which he spoke , my trial seemed to grow light and easy : and He who knows our hearts , my dearest , at this moment , and who knows there is no drop of bitterness or grief -- of anything but unmixed happiness -- in mine , enabled me to make the resolution that I never would be Alfred 's wife . That he should be my brother , and your husband , if the course I took could bring that happy end to pass ; but that I never would ( Grace , I then loved him dearly , dearly ! ) be his wife ! "

35293	35303	35305	35305	she	765	" I had tried to seem indifferent to him ; "
35315	35500	35305	35305	she	765	" but that was hard , and you were always his true advocate . I had tried to tell you of my resolution , but you would never hear me ; you would never understand me . The time was drawing near for his return . I felt that I must act , before the daily intercourse between us was renewed . I knew that one great pang , undergone at that time , would save a lengthened agony to all of us . I knew that if I went away then , that end must follow which _ has _ followed , and which has made us both so happy , Grace ! I wrote to good Aunt Martha , for a refuge in her house : I did not then tell her all , but something of my story , and she freely promised it . While I was contesting that step with myself , and with my love of you , and home , Mr. Warden , brought here by an accident , became , for some time , our companion . "

35564	35694	35555	35555	Marion	15	" on the eve of going secretly away for a long time . He wrote to me , after leaving here ; told me what his condition and prospects really were ; and offered me his hand . He told me he had seen I was not happy in the prospect of Alfred 's return . I believe he thought my heart had no part in that contract ; perhaps thought I might have loved him once , and did not then ; perhaps thought that when I tried to seem indifferent , I tried to hide indifference -- I can not tell . But I wished that you should feel me wholly lost to Alfred -- hopeless to him -- dead . Do you understand me , love ? "
35709	35747	35704	35704	She	181	" I saw Mr. Warden , and confided in his honor ; charged him with my secret , on the eve of his and my departure . He kept it . Do you understand me , dear ? "

35771	35958	35769	35769	Marion	15	" recall your thoughts a moment : listen to me . Do not look so strangely on me . There are countries , dearest , where those who would abjure a misplaced passion , or would strive against some cherished feeling of their hearts and conquer it , retire into a hopeless solitude , and close the world against themselves and worldly loves and hopes for ever . When women do so , they assume that name which is so dear to you and me , and call each other Sisters . But there may be sisters , Grace , who , in the broad world out of doors , and underneath its free sky , and in its crowded places and among its busy life , and trying to assist and cheer it and to do some good,--learn the same lesson ; and , with hearts still fresh and young , and open to all happiness and means of happiness , can say the battle is long past , the victory long won . And such a one am I ! You understand me now ? "

But as I left here , so I have returned .
