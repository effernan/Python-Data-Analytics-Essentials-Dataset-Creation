Not eight years ago , sir -- would you believe me?--I was supping nightly in private with the Bishop , who had nearly quarrelled with his late Highness for carrying me off by force one evening to his casino ; I was heaped with dignities and favours ; all the poets in the town composed sonnets in my honour ; the Marquess of Trescorre fought a duel about me with the Bishop 's nephew , Don Serafino ; I attended his lordship to Rome ; I spent the villeggiatura at his villa , where I sat at play with the highest nobles in the land ; yet when my voice went , cavaliere , it was on my knees I had to beg of my heartless patron the paltry favour of the minor orders !

I 've a pretty taste , too , in compiling almanacks , and when nothing else served I have played the public scrivener at the street corner ; nay , sir , necessity has even driven me to hold the candle in one or two transactions I would not more actively have mixed in ; and it was to efface the remembrance of one of these -- for my conscience is still over - nice for my condition -- that I set out on this laborious pilgrimage .

Turin is blessed with a court where good manners and a fine tone are more highly prized than the extravagances of genius ; and I have heard it said of his Majesty that he was delighted to see his courtiers wearing the French fashions outside their heads , provided they did n't carry the French ideas within . You are too young , doubtless , cavaliere , to have heard of the philosophers who are raising such a pother north of the Alps : a set of madmen that , because their birth does n't give them the entree of Versailles , are preaching that men should return to a state of nature , great ladies suckle their young like animals , and the peasantry own their land like nobles . Luckily you 'll hear little of this infectious talk in Turin : the King stamps out the philosophers like vermin or packs them off to splutter their heresies in Milan or Venice . But to a nobleman mindful of the privileges of his condition there is no more agreeable sojourn in Europe . The wines are delicious , the women -- er -- accomplished -- and though the sbirri may hug one a trifle close now and then , why , with money and discretion , a friend or two in the right quarters , and the wit to stand well with the Church , there 's no city in Europe where a man may have pleasanter sins to confess .

If God had meant us to break our teeth on nuts and roots , why did He hang the vine with fruit and draw three crops of wheat from this indulgent soil ?

For whether we regard these figured stones as of terriginous origin , either mere lusus naturae , or mineral formations produced by a plastic virtue latent in the earth , or whether as in fact organic substances lapidified by the action of water ; in either case , what speculations must their origin excite , leading us back into that dark and unexplored period of time when the breath of Creation was yet moving on the face of the waters !

It is only by united action that we can prevail . The bravest mob of independent fighters has little chance against a handful of disciplined soldiers , and the Church is perfectly logical in seeing her chief danger in the Encyclopaedia 's systematised marshalling of scattered truths . As long as the attacks on her authority were isolated , and as it were sporadic , she had little to fear even from the assaults of genius ; but the most ordinary intellect may find a use and become a power in the ranks of an organised opposition . Seneca tells us the slaves in ancient Rome were at one time so numerous that the government prohibited their wearing a distinctive dress lest they should learn their strength and discover that the city was in their power ; and the Church knows that when the countless spirits she has enslaved without subduing have once learned their number and efficiency they will hold her doctrines at their mercy.--The Church again , "

By so doing she placed herself in a position which was well - nigh impregnable till the school of Newton substituted observation for intuition and his followers showed with increasing clearness the inability of the human mind to apprehend anything outside the range of experience . The ultimate claim of the Church rests on the hypothesis of an intuitive faculty in man . Disprove the existence of this faculty , and reason must remain the supreme test of truth . Against reason the fabric of theological doctrine can not long hold out , and the Church 's doctrinal authority once shaken , men will no longer fear to test by ordinary rules the practical results of her teaching . We have not joined the great army of truth to waste our time in vain disputations over metaphysical subtleties . Our aim is , by freeing the mind of man from superstition to relieve him from the practical abuses it entails . As it is impossible to examine any fiscal or industrial problem without discovering that the chief obstacle to improvement lies in the Church 's countless privileges and exemptions , so in every department of human activity we find some inveterate wrong taking shelter under the claim of a divinely - revealed authority . This claim demolished , the stagnant current of human progress will soon burst its barriers and set with a mighty rush toward the wide ocean of truth and freedom ... "

51046	51101	51102	51102	he	1415	" is a handsome offer , and one for which I thank you ; but I fear our presence may incommode you and the additional weight of our luggage perhaps delay your progress . I have little fear but some van or waggon will overtake us before nightfall ; and should it chance otherwise , "
51111	51136	51102	51102	he	1415	" why , it behoves us to remember that we shall be none the worse off , since the sage is independent of circumstances . "

I have long foreseen that any attempt to raise the condition of my countrymen must end in imprisonment or flight ; and though perhaps to have suffered the former had been a more impressive vindication of my views , why , sir , the father at the last moment overruled the philosopher , and thinking of my poor girl there , who but for me stands alone in the world , I resolved to take refuge in a state where a man may work for the liberty of others without endangering his own .

62734	62774	62775	62775	he	234	" that you will find both branches of investigation somewhat difficult to pursue in Pianura ; for the Church takes care that neither the philosophers nor their books shall gain a footing in our most Christian state . Indeed , "
62778	62869	62775	62775	he	234	" not only must the library be free from heretical works , but the librarian clear of heretical leanings ; and since you have honoured me with your confidence I will own that , the court having got wind of my supposed tendency to liberalism , I live in daily expectation of dismissal . For the moment they are content to keep their spies on me ; but were it not for the protection of the good abate , my superior , I should long since have been turned out . "

62892	63201	63238	63239	The hunchback	8158	" Because , sir , in our virtuous duchy the terms are interchangeable . The Duke is in fact so zealous a son of the Church that if the latter showed any leniency to sinners the secular arm would promptly repair her negligence . His Highness , as you may have heard , is ruled by his confessor , an adroit Dominican . The confessor , it is true , has two rivals , the Countess Belverde , a lady distinguished for her piety , and a German astrologer or alchemist , lately come to Pianura , and calling himself a descendant of the Egyptian priesthood and an adept of the higher or secret doctrines of Neoplatonism . These three , however , though ostensibly rivals for the Duke 's favour , live on such good terms with one another that they are suspected of having entered into a secret partnership ; while some regard them all as the emissaries of the Jesuits , who , since the suppression of the Society , are known to have kept a footing in Pianura , as in most of the Italian states . As to the Duke , the death of the Marquess of Cerveno , the failing health of the little prince , and his own strange physical infirmities , have so preyed on his mind that he is the victim of any who are unscrupulous enough to trade on the fears of a diseased imagination . His counsellors , however divided in doctrine , have at least one end in common ; and that is , to keep the light of reason out of the darkened chamber in which they have confined him ; and with such a ruler and such principles of government , you may fancy that poor philosophy has not where to lay her head . "
63202	63207	63208	63208	Odo	234	" And the people ? "
63211	63237	63208	63208	Odo	234	" What of the fiscal administration ? In some states where liberty of thought is forbidden the material welfare of the subject is nevertheless considered . "
63244	63250	63252	63252	he	8158	" It may be so , "
63254	63332	63333	63333	he	8158	" though I had thought the principle of moral tyranny must infect every branch of public administration . With us , at all events , where the Church party rules , the privileges and exemptions of the clergy are the chief source of suffering , and the state of passive ignorance in which they have kept the people has bred in the latter a dull resignation that is the surest obstacle to reform . Oh , sir , "
63342	63425	63333	63333	he	8158	" if you could see , as I do , the blind brute misery on which all the magnificence of rank and all the refinements of luxury are built , you would feel , as you drive along this road , that with every turn of the wheels you are passing over the bodies of those who have toiled without ceasing that you might ride in a gilt coach , and have gone hungry that you might feast in Kings ' palaces !

63503	63515	63495	63495	Gamba	282	" But this is no time to speak of such things . "
63787	63798	63799	63799	Odo	234	" Are such failings always so severely punished in Pianura ? "

The fellow , "
63905	64029	63902	63902	he	234	" is a man of some learning and of a retired and orderly way of living , and the charge was brought against him by a jeweller and his wife , who owed him a sum of money and are said to have chosen this way of evading payment . The priests are always glad to find a scape - goat of the sort , especially when there are murmurs against the private conduct of those in high places , and the woman , having denounced him , was immediately assured by her confessor that any debt incurred to a seducer was null and void , and that she was entitled to a hundred scudi of damages for having been led into sin .

His health , as you probably know , has long been a cause of anxiety to his illustrious parents , and when I was summoned to Pianura the College of Physicians had given up all hope of saving him . Since my coming , however , I flatter myself that a marked change is perceptible . My method is that of invigorating the blood by exciting the passions most likely to produce a generous vital ardour . Thus , by organising these juvenile manoeuvres , I arouse the prince 's martial zeal ; by encouraging him to study the history of his ancestors , I evoke his political ambition ; by causing him to be led about the gardens on a pony , accompanied by a miniature pack of Maltese dogs in pursuit of a tame doe , I stimulate the passion of the chase ; but it is essential to my system that one emotion should not violently counteract another , and I am therefore obliged to protect my noble patient from the sudden intrusion of new impressions .

I can not think that , in this age of infidelity and disorder , God can design to deprive a Christian state of a line of sovereigns uniformly zealous in the defence of truth ; but the purposes of Heaven are inscrutable , as the recent suppression of the Society of Jesus has most strangely proved ; and should our dynasty be extinguished I am consoled by the thought that the rule will pass to one of our house . Of this I shall have more to say to you in future . Meanwhile your first business is to acquaint yourself with your new surroundings . The Duchess holds a circle this evening , where you will meet the court ; but I must advise you that the persons her Highness favours with her intimacy are not those best qualified to guide and instruct a young man in your position . These you will meet at the house of the Countess Belverde , one of the Duchess 's ladies , a woman of sound judgment and scrupulous piety , who gathers about her all our most learned and saintly ecclesiastics . Count Trescorre will instruct you in all that becomes your position at court , and my director , Father Ignazio , will aid you in the selection of a confessor . As to the Bishop , a most worthy and conversable prelate , to whom I would have you show all due regard , his zeal in spiritual matters is not as great as I could wish , and in private talk he indulges in a laxity of opinion against which I can not too emphatically warn you . Happily , however , Pianura offers other opportunities of edification . Father Ignazio is a man of wide learning and inflexible doctrine , and in several of our monasteries , notably that of the Barnabites , you will find examples of sanctity and wisdom such as a young man may well devoutly consider . Our convents also are distinguished for the severity of their rule and the spiritual privileges accorded them . The Carmelites have every reason to hope for the beatification of their aged Prioress , and among the nuns of the Perpetual Adoration is one who has recently received the ineffable grace of the vulnus divinum . In the conversation of these saintly nuns , and of the holy Abbot of the Barnabites , you will find the surest safeguard against those errors and temptations that beset your age . "

Prince Ferrante being sickly from his birth , the Marquess was always looked on as the Duke 's successor , and to Trescorre , who even then , as Master of the Horse , cherished the ambitions he has since realised , no prospect could have been more distasteful . My noble brother , to do him justice , has always hated the Jesuits , who , as you doubtless know , were all - powerful here before the recent suppression of the Order . The Marquess of Cerveno was as completely under their control as the Duke is under that of the Dominicans , and Trescorre knew that with the Marquess 's accession his own rule must end . He did his best to gain an influence over his future ruler , but failing in this resolved to ruin him . "
72466	72617	72449	72450	the Duke	682	" Nothing could better have served Trescorre ; for opposition spurred the Marquess 's languid temper , and he had now the incredible folly to take up his residence in the lodge . Within three weeks the fever held him . He was at once taken to Pianura , and on recovering from his seizure was sent to take the mountain air at the baths of Lucca . But the poison was in his blood . He never regained more than a semblance of health , and his madness having run its course , his passion for Momola turned to hate of the poor girl to whom he ascribed his destruction . Giannozzo , meanwhile , terrified by the report that the Duke had winded the intrigue , and fearing to be charged with connivance , thought to prove his innocence by casting off his wife and disowning her child . "
72836	72966	72967	72967	I	0	" This narrative , and the sight of Momola and her child , followed so strangely on the spectacle of sordid misery he had witnessed at Pontesordo , that an inarticulate pity held Odo by the throat .

What were they all -- Momola , her child , and her persecutors -- but a sickly growth of the decaying social order ? He felt an almost physical longing for fresh air , light , the rush of a purifying wind through the atmosphere of moral darkness that surrounded him . 2.12 . To relieve the tension of his thoughts he set forth to Gamba the purpose of his visit . "

73475	73560	73561	73561	he	3915	" In so ticklish a situation I see none but Trescorre to maintain the political balance . He has been adroit enough to make himself necessary to the Duchess without alienating the Duke ; he has introduced one or two trifling reforms that have given him a name for liberality in spite of the heavy taxes with which he has loaded the peasantry ; and has in short so played his cards as to profit by the foibles of both parties . Her Highness , "
73573	73869	73561	73561	he	3915	" was much taken by him when she first came to Pianura ; and before her feeling had cooled he had contrived to make himself indispensable to her . The Duchess is always in debt ; and Trescorre , as Comptroller of Finance , holds her by her besetting weakness . Before his appointment her extravagance was the scandal of the town . She borrowed from her ladies , her pages , her very lacqueys ; when she went on a visit to her uncle of Monte Alloro she pocketed the money he bestowed on her servants ; nay , she was even accused of robbing the Marchioness of Pievepelago , who , having worn one evening a diamond necklace which excited her Highness 's admiration , was waylaid on the way home and the jewels torn from her neck by a crowd of masked ruffians among whom she is said to have recognised one of the ducal servants . These are doubtless idle reports ; but it is certain that Trescorre 's appointment engaged him still more to the Duchess by enabling him to protect her from such calumnies ; while by increasing the land taxes he has discharged the worst of her debts and thus made himself popular with the tradesmen she had ruined . Your excellency must excuse my attempting to paint the private character of her Highness . Such facts as I have reported are of public notoriety , but to exceed them would be an unwarranted presumption . I know she has the name of being affable to her dependents , capable of a fitful generosity , and easily moved by distress ; and it is certain that her domestic situation has been one to excite pity and disarm criticism . "
74146	74363	74364	74364	His	3933	" A few years since , at the instigation of his confessor , he destroyed every picture in the ducal gallery that contained any naked figure or represented any subject offensive to religion . Among them was Titian 's famous portrait of Duke Ascanio 's mistress , known as the Goldsmith 's Daughter , and a Venus by the Venetian painter Giorgione , so highly esteemed in its day that Pope Leo X. is said to have offered in exchange for it the gift of a papal benefice , and a Cardinal 's hat for Duke Guidobaldo 's younger son . His Highness , moreover , impedes the administration of justice by resisting all attempts to restrict the Church 's right of sanctuary , and upholds the decree forbidding his subjects to study at the University of Pavia , where , as you know , the natural sciences are professed by the ablest scholars of Italy . He allows no public duties to interfere with his private devotions , and whatever the urgency of affairs , gives no audience to his ministers on holydays ; and a Cardinal a latere recently passing through the duchy on his return to Rome was not received at the Duke 's table because he chanced to arrive on a Friday . "
74572	74798	74799	74799	Gamba	282	" As to the Duke , having no settled policy , and being governed only through his fears , he leans first to one influence and then to another ; but since the suppression of the Jesuits nothing can induce him to attack any ecclesiastical privileges . The diocese of Pianura holds a fief known as the Caccia del Vescovo , long noted as the most lawless district of the duchy . Before the death of the late Pope , Trescorre had prevailed on the Duke to annex it to the principality ; but the dreadful fate of Ganganelli has checked bolder sovereigns than his Highness in their attempts on the immunities of the Church , and one of the fairest regions of our unhappy state remains a barren waste , the lair of outlaws and assassins , and a menace to the surrounding country . His Highness is not incapable of generous impulses and his occasional acts of humanity might endear him to his people were it not that they despise him for being the creature of his favourites . Thus , the gift of Boscofolto to the Belverde has excited the bitterest discontent ; for the Countess is notorious for her cruel exactions , and it is certain that at her death this rich fief will revert to the Church . And now , "
74805	75287	74799	74799	Gamba	282	" I have made known to your excellency the chief characters in the masque , as rumour depicts them to the vulgar . As to the court , like the government , it is divided into two parties : the Duke 's , headed by the Belverde , and containing the staider and more conservative members of the Church and nobility ; and the Duchess 's , composed of every fribble and flatterer , every gamester and rake , every intriguing woman and vulgar parvenu that can worm a way into her favour . In such an atmosphere you may fancy how knowledge thrives . The Duke 's library consists of a few volumes of theological casuistry , and her Highness never opens a book unless it be to scandalise her husband by reading some prohibited pamphlet from France . The University , since the fall of the Jesuits , has been in charge of the Barnabite order , and , for aught I know , the Ptolemaic system is still taught there , together with the dialectic of Aristotle . As to science , it is anathema ; and the press being subject to the restrictions of the Holy Office , and the University closed to modern thought , but few scholars are to be found in the duchy , save those who occupy themselves with belles - lettres , or , like the abate Crescenti , are engaged in historical research . Pianura , even in the late Duke 's day , had its circle of lettered noblemen who patronised the arts and founded the local Arcadia ; but such pursuits are out of fashion , the Arcadia languishes , and the Bishop of Pianura is the only dignitary that still plays the Mecaenas . His lordship , whose theological laxity and coolness toward the Holy Office have put him out of favour with the Duke , has , I am told , a fine cabinet of paintings ( some of them , it is rumoured , the very pictures that his Highness ordered to be burnt ) and the episcopal palace swarms with rhyming abatini , fashionable playwrights and musicians , and the travelling archeologists who hawk their antiques about from one court to another . Here you may assist at interminable disputes as to the relative merits of Tasso and Ariosto , or listen to a learned dissertation on the verse engraved on a carnelian stone ; but as to the questions now agitating the world , they are held of less account than a problem in counterpoint or the construction of a doubtful line in Ovid . As long as Truth goes naked she can scarce hope to be received in good company ; and her appearance would probably cause as much confusion among the Bishop 's literati as in the councils of the Holy Office .

It is said his Highness intends to subject the little prince to some mysterious treatment connected with the rites of the Egyptian priesthood , of whose secret doctrine Heiligenstern pretends to be an adept . Yesterday it was bruited that the Duchess loudly opposed the experiment ; this afternoon it is given out that she has yielded . What the result may be , none can foresee ; but whichever way the storm blows , the chief danger probably threatens those who have had any connection with the secret societies known to exist in the duchy .

In the course of his investigations he became aware that the order had secretly established a lodge in Pianura ; and hastening hither from Rome to advise your Highness of the fact , has discovered in the so - called Count Heiligenstern one of the most notorious apostles of the order .

The so - called Count Heiligenstern is the son of a tailor in a small village of Pomerania . After passing through various vicissitudes with which I need not trouble your Highness , he obtained the confidence of the notorious Dr. Weishaupt , the founder of the German order of the Illuminati , and together this precious couple have indefatigably propagated their obscene and blasphemous doctrines . That they preach atheism and tyrannicide I need not tell your Highness ; but it is less generally known that they have made these infamous doctrines the cloak of private vices from which even paganism would have recoiled . The man now before me , among other open offences against society , is known to have seduced a young girl of noble family in Ratisbon and to have murdered her child . His own wife and children he long since abandoned and disowned ; and the youth yonder , whom he describes as a Georgian slave rescued from the Grand Signior 's galleys , is in fact the wife of a Greek juggler of Ravenna , and has forsaken her husband to live in criminal intercourse with an atheist and assassin .

Having firmly established every point in my argument according to the Baconian method of investigation , I felt it my duty to enlighten my scholars ; and in the course of my last lecture I announced the result of my investigations .

Our own motto has declared it : Ad majorem Dei gloriam -- who works for the Society works for its Master . If our zeal has been sometimes misdirected , our blood has a thousand times witnessed to its sincerity . In the Indies , in America , in England during the great persecution , and lately on our own unnatural coasts , the Jesuits have died for Christ as joyfully as His first disciples died for Him . Yet these are but a small number in comparison with the countless servants of the order who , labouring in far countries among savage peoples , or surrounded by the heretical enemies of our faith , have died the far bitterer death of moral isolation : setting themselves to their task with the knowledge that their lives were but so much indistinguishable dust to be added to the sum of human effort . What association founded on human interests has ever commanded such devotion ? And what merely human authority could count on such unquestioning obedience , not in a mob of poor illiterate monks , but in men chosen for their capacity and trained to the exercise of their highest faculties ?

116849	116899	116846	116846	she	362	" I am not ill , and at first I was reluctant to make use of such a subterfuge ; but to feign an indisposition was the only way of speaking with you privately , and , alas , in this school one soon becomes a proficient in deceit . "
116911	116960	116900	116900	She	362	" Even this favour I could not have obtained save through Sister Mary of the Crucifix ; but she now understands that you are an old friend of my father 's , and that my motive for wishing to see you is not what she at first supposed . "

117266	117324	117325	117325	she	362	" scarce warrants such a presumption , yet I believe that in my father 's name I may appeal to you . It may be that with the best will to help me you can discover no way of doing so , but at least I shall have the benefit of your advice . I now see , "
117339	117383	117325	117325	she	362	" the madness of my late attempt , and the depth of the abyss from which you rescued me . Death were indeed preferable to such chances ; but I do not mean to die while life holds out a hope of liberation . "

117707	117783	117704	117704	she	362	" three nuns have tried to obtain their release , and one has conclusively proved that she was forced to take the vows by fraud ; but their pleas have been rejected , and mine would meet the same fate . Indeed , the only result would be to deprive me of what little liberty I am allowed ; for the three nuns I speak of are now the most closely watched in the convent . "

117844	117919	117841	117841	she	362	" I must cross the borders of Switzerland . If I could reach Geneva I should be beyond the arm of the Holy Office , and at the University there I should find friends of my father who would surely take pity on my situation and help me to a living . But the journey is long and difficult , and not to be safely attempted without some assurance of shelter on the way . "

121580	121609	121573	121573	she	362	" I did but claim my pay in advance ; nor do I think that , when she knows all , Sister Veronica will grudge me my reward ! "
121631	121669	121670	121670	she	362	" You simpleton , can you not guess that you were watched , and that but for me your Veronica would at this moment be lying under lock and key in her cell ? Instead of which , "
121691	121733	121670	121670	she	362	" instead of which she now awaits you in a safe nook of my choosing , where , within half an hour 's time , you may atone to her with interest for the infidelity into which I have betrayed you . "

She fancies that she has been sent from the convent to avoid you -- as indeed she was , and by the Reverend Mother 's own order , who , it seems , had wind of the intrigue this morning . But , the saints be praised , the excellent sister who was ordered to attend her is in my pay and instead of conducting her to her relatives of San Barnado , who were to keep her locked up over night , has , if I mistake not , taken her to a good woman of my acquaintance -- an old servant , in fact -- who will guard her as jealously as the family plate till you and I come to her release .

122041	122099	122100	122100	she	268	" and I scarce wonder at your distrust ; for your plans were so well laid that I had no notion of what was on foot , and must have remained in ignorance if Veronica had not been put in Sister Martha 's charge . But you will both live to thank me , and I hope , "
122105	122124	122100	122100	she	268	" to own that you would have done better to take me into your confidence from the first . "

Not two hours since I had a gentleman here that gave the very same excuse for hurrying forward ; though his horses were so spent that I had to provide him with another pair before he could continue his journey .

He fancied she might have passed this way and questioned me closely ; but as it happened there had been no petticoat under my roof for three days.--I wonder , now , if he could have been looking for your excellencies ?

128742	128790	128735	128735	he	234	" is the Papal Nuncio 's authorisation to the Signorina Fulvia Vivaldi , known in religion as Sister Veronica , to absent herself from Italy for an indefinite period . With this passport and a good escort your companion will have no difficulty in joining her friends . "

His Highness may revoke your appointment at any hour . Of late I have had his ear , but I have now been near a week absent , and you know the Duke is not long constant to one purpose.--Cavaliere , "

I have never abandoned the aims your father taught me to strive for ; they are dearer , more sacred to me than ever ; but I can not strive for them alone . I must feel your hand in mine , I must know that your heart beats with mine , I must hear the voice of liberty speak to me in your voice-- "

130197	130292	130186	130186	she	6372	" but it is not for me to look on . What you said last is not true . If you love me it is because we have thought the same thoughts , dreamed the same dream , heard the same voice -- in each other 's voices , perhaps , as you say , but none the less a real voice , apart from us and above us , and one which would speak to us as loudly if we were apart -- one which both of us must follow to the end .

130430	130559	130427	130427	he	6371	" we must follow that voice to the end ; but why not together ? Your father himself often questioned whether the patriot could not serve his people better at a distance than in their midst . In France , where the new ideas are not only tolerated but put in practice , we shall be able to study their effects and to learn how they may best be applied to the relief of our own unhappy people ; and as a private person , independent of party and patronage , could I not do more than as the nominal head of a narrow priest - ridden government , where every act and word would be used by my enemies to injure me and the cause I represent ?

130628	130636	130637	130637	she	362	" What you say might be true , "
130640	130696	130637	130637	she	362	" were your opportunities indeed restricted to the regency . But the little prince 's life is known to hang on a thread : at any moment you may be Duke .

130713	130868	130710	130710	he	234	" Even as Duke I must be the puppet of powers greater than myself -- of Austria , of Rome , nay , of the wealthy nobles who will always league themselves with their sovereign 's enemies rather than suffer a hand upon their privileges . And even if I were fortunate enough to outwit my masters and rule indeed , over what a toy kingdom should I reign ! How small a number would be benefited ! How little the cause would be helped by my example ! As an obscure pamphleteer I might reach the hearts of thousands and speak to great kings on their thrones ; as Duke of Pianura , fighting single - handed to reform the laws of my little state , I should rank at best with the other petty sovereigns who are amusing themselves all over Italy with agricultural experiments and improved methods of cheese - making .

130878	130884	130885	130885	she	362	" How you love me ! "
130905	131011	130885	130885	she	362	" For it is love that speaks thus in you and not reason ; and you know as I do that the duty to which a man is born comes before any of his own choosing . You are called to serve liberty on a throne , I in some obscure corner of the private life . We can no more exchange our duties than our stations ; but if our lives divide , our purpose remains one , and as pious persons recall each other in the mystery of the Sacrament , so we shall meet in spirit in the new religion we profess .

131052	131130	131049	131049	she	362	" I implore you to lose no time in reaching Pianura . Occasion is short - lived , and an hour 's lingering may cost you the regency , and with it the chance of gaining a hold on your people . I will not expatiate , as some might , on the power and dignities that await you . You are no adventurer plotting to steal a throne , but a soldier pledged to his post . "

131156	131196	131154	131154	she	362	" has deigned to look for a moment on a poor girl that crossed your path . Now your eyes must be on your people , who will yet have cause to love and bless you as she does . "

Think for how many generations their unheeded sufferings , their unrewarded toil , have paid for the pomp and pleasure of your house ! That is the debt you are called on to acquit , the wrong you are pledged to set right . "

You ask me to give up at a stroke all that makes life desirable : to set forth , without a backward glance , on the very road that leads me farthest from you ! Yesterday I might have obeyed ; but how can I turn today from this near view of my happiness ? "
131789	131833	131834	131834	He	234	" Fulvia , if you ask this sacrifice of me , is there none you will make in return ? If you bid me go forth and work for my people , will you not come with me and work for them too ? "

I will not say that I have my own work to do ; for the dearest service I could perform would be to help you in yours . But to do this I must stand aside . To be near you I must go from you . To love you I must give you up . "

Nothing could be more fatal to your prospects than to have it said that you had chosen a former Jesuit as your advisor . In the present juncture of affairs it is needful that you should appear to be in sympathy with the liberals , and that whatever reforms you attempt should seem the result of popular pressure rather than of your own free choice . Such an attitude may not flatter the sovereign 's pride , and is in fact merely a higher form of expediency ; but it is one which the proudest monarchs of Europe are finding themselves constrained to take if they would preserve their power and use it effectually .

Listen to them , if you will -- conciliate them , if you can ! We need all the allies we can win . Only do not fancy they are really speaking for the people . Do not think it is the people 's voice you hear . The people do not ask you to weigh this claim against that , to look too curiously into the defects and merits of every clause in their charter .

Of what use to offer a crown to our Lady , when you have it in your heart to slight her servants ? But I will not speak of the clergy , since you despise them -- nor of the nobles , since you ignore their claims . I will speak only of the people -- the people , in whose interest you profess to act . Believe me , in striking at the Church you wound the poor . It is not their bodily welfare I mean -- though Heaven knows how many sources of bounty must now run dry ! It is their faith you insult . First you turn them against their masters , then against their God . They may acclaim you for it now -- but I tell you they will hate you for it in the end ! "

I hear some of my fellow - tradesmen complaining that the nobility do n't pay their bills . Will they be better paid , think you , when the Duke has halved their revenues ? Will the quality keep up as large households , employ as many lacqueys , set as lavish tables , wear as fine clothes , collect as many rarities , buy as many horses , give us , in short , as many opportunities of making our profit out of their pleasure ?

It 's true they may get the best morsel in the pot and the warmest seat on the hearth -- and one of them , now and then , may take too long to teach a pretty girl her Pater Noster -- but I 'm not sure we shall be better off when they 're gone . Formerly , if a child too many came to poor folk they could always comfort themselves with the thought that , if there was no room for him at home , the Church was there to provide for him .

162558	162602	162555	162555	he	7702	" God forbid ! The new charter 's none of my making . It 's only another dodge for getting round the populace -- for appearing to give them what they would rise up and take if it were denied them any longer . "

Reform is bound to come , whether your Dukes and Princes are for it or against it ; and those that grant constitutions instead of refusing them are like men who tie a string to their hats before going out in a gale .

163582	163626	163577	163577	he	234	" There are always more good reasons against a new state of things than for it . I am not surprised that Count Trescorre appears to have withdrawn his opposition . I believe he now honestly wishes your Highness to proclaim the constitution . "

163822	163829	163830	163830	he	234	" You have always told me , "
163834	163886	163830	163830	he	234	" that the love of dominion was your brother 's ruling passion . If he really believes this movement will be popular with the people , why should he secretly oppose it , instead of making the most of his own share in it as the minister of a popular sovereign ? "
163887	163892	163781	163781	He	682	" For several reasons , "
163897	163954	163955	163955	he	234	" In the first place , the reforms your Highness has introduced are not of his own choosing , and Trescorre has little sympathy with any policy he has not dictated . In the second place , the powers and opportunities of a constitutional minister are too restricted to satisfy his appetite for rule ; and thirdly-- "
163968	163990	163955	163955	he	234	received--"I suspect Trescorre of having a private score against your Highness , which he would be glad to pay off publicly . "
164004	164016	164017	164017	he	234	" I know not what score he may have against me , "
164022	164058	164017	164017	he	234	" but what injures me must injure the state , and if Trescorre has any such motive for withdrawing his opposition , it must be because he believes the constitution will defeat its own ends . "
164059	164095	163955	163955	he	234	" He does believe that , assuredly ; but he is not the only one of your Highness 's ministers that would ruin the state on the chance of finding an opportunity among the ruins . "
164096	164104	164106	164106	Odo	234	" That is as it may be , "
164113	164175	164106	164106	Odo	234	" I have seen enough of human ambition to learn how limited and unimaginative a passion it is . If it saw farther I should fear it more . But if it is short - sighted it sees clearly at close range ; and the motive you ascribe to Trescorre would imply that he believes the constitution will be a failure . "
164176	164288	164289	164289	Odo	234	" Without doubt , your Highness . I am convinced that your ministers have done all they could to prevent the proclamation of the charter , and failing that , to thwart its workings if it be proclaimed . In this they have gone hand in hand with the clergy , and their measures have been well taken . But I do not believe that any state of mind produced by external influences can long withstand the natural drift of opinion ; and your Highness may be sure that , though the talkers and writers are mostly against you in this matter , the mass of the people are with you . "
164296	164329	164289	164289	Odo	234	" How can I be sure , when the people have no means of expressing their needs ? It is like trying to guess the wants of a deaf and dumb man ! "
164335	164346	164347	164347	he	8158	" The people will not always be deaf and dumb , "
164350	164357	164347	164347	he	8158	" Some day they will speak . "
164358	164364	164366	164366	Odo	234	" Not in my day , "
164369	164448	164449	164449	Gamba	282	" And meanwhile we blunder on , without ever really knowing what incalculable instincts and prejudices are pitted against us . You and your party tell me the people are sick of the burdens the clergy lay on them -- yet their blind devotion to the Church is manifest at every turn , and it did not need the business of the Virgin 's crown to show me how little reason and justice can avail against such influences . "
164456	164464	164465	164465	he	282	" As to the Virgin 's crown , "
164468	164555	164465	164465	he	282	" your Highness must have guessed it was one of the friars ' tricks : a last expedient to turn the people against you . I was not bred up by a priest for nothing ; I know what past masters those gentry are in raising ghosts and reading portents . They know the minds of the poor folk as the herdsman knows the habits of his cattle ; and for generations they have used that knowledge to bring the people more completely under their control . "
164556	164568	164569	164569	Odo	234	" And what have we to oppose to such a power ? "
164572	164647	164569	164569	Odo	234	" We are fighting the battle of ideas against passions , of reflection against instinct ; and you have but to look in the human heart to guess which side will win in such a struggle . We have science and truth and common - sense with us , you say -- yes , but the Church has love and fear and tradition , and the solidarity of nigh two thousand years of dominion . "
164662	164793	164655	164655	he	282	" All that your Highness says is true ; but I beg leave to relate to your Highness a tale which I read lately in an old book of your library . According to this story it appears that when the early Christians of Alexandria set out to destroy the pagan idols in the temples they were seized with great dread at sight of the god Serapis ; for even those that did not believe in the old gods feared them , and none dared raise a hand against the sacred image . But suddenly a soldier who was bolder than the rest flung his battle - axe at the figure -- and when it broke in pieces , there rushed out nothing worse than a great company of rats . "
165030	165036	165037	165037	he	682	" How young you look ! "

165056	165103	165052	165052	she	362	" I am glad of that , for I feel extraordinarily young tonight . Perhaps it is because I have been thinking a great deal of the old days -- of Venice and Turin -- and of the high - road to Vercelli , for instance . "
165112	165117	165118	165118	she	362	" Do you know , "
165141	165158	165118	165118	she	362	" that there is one secret of mine you have never guessed in all these years ? "
165164	165172	165173	165173	he	682	" What is it , I wonder ? "
165184	165194	165176	165176	She	362	" I knew why you deserted us at Vercelli . "
165209	165254	165201	165201	she	362	" Ah , how angry I was then -- but why be angry now ? It all happened so long ago ; and if it had not happened -- who knows?--perhaps you would never have pitied me enough to love me as you did . "
165289	165297	165276	165276	she	362	" Are your plans fixed for tomorrow ? "
165317	165323	165324	165324	he	682	" The constitution is signed , "
165327	165336	165324	165324	he	682	" and my ministers proclaim it tomorrow morning . "

173333	173340	173341	173342	the Jesuit	5602	" The highest claim of Christianity , "
173365	173816	173341	173342	the Jesuit	5602	" is that it has come nearer to solving the problem of men 's relations to each other than any system invented by themselves . This , after all , is the secret principle of the Church 's vitality . She gave a spiritual charter of equality to mankind long before the philosophers thought of giving them a material one . If , all the while , she has been fighting for dominion , arrogating to herself special privileges , struggling to preserve the old lines of social and legal demarcation , it has been because for nigh two thousand years she has cherished in her breast the one free city of the spirit , because to guard its liberties she has had to defend and strengthen her own position . I do not ask you to consider whence comes this insight into the needs of man , this mysterious power over him ; I ask you simply to confess them in their results . I am not of those who believe that God permits good to come to mankind through one channel only , and I doubt not that now and in times past the thinkers whom your Highness follows have done much to raise the condition of their fellows ; but I would have you observe that , where they have done so , it has been because , at bottom , their aims coincided with the Church 's . The deeper you probe into her secret sources of power , the more you find there , in the germ if you will , but still potentially active , all those humanising energies which work together for the lifting of the race . In her wisdom and her patience she may have seen fit to withhold their expression , to let them seek another outlet ; but they are there , stored in her consciousness like the archetypes of the Platonists in the Universal Mind . It is the knowledge of this , the sure knowledge of it , which creates the atmosphere of serenity that you feel about you . From the tilling of the vineyards , or the dressing of a beggar 's sores , to the loftiest and most complicated intellectual labour imposed on him , each brother knows that his daily task is part of a great scheme of action , working ever from imperfection to perfection , from human incompleteness to the divine completion . This sense of being , not straws on a blind wind of chance , but units in an ordered force , gives to the humblest Christian an individual security and dignity which kings on their thrones might envy . "
174002	175084	175139	175142	instigators of false liberty	8034	" Meanwhile the shufflings of destiny had brought to Trescorre the prize for which he waited . During the Duke 's illness he had been appointed regent of Pianura , and his sovereign 's reluctance to take up the cares of government had now left him for six months in authority . The day after the proclaiming of the constitution Odo had withdrawn his signature from it , on the ground that the concessions it contained were inopportune . The functions of government went on again in the old way . The old abuses persisted , the old offences were condoned : it was as though the apathy of the sovereign had been communicated to his people . Centuries of submission were in their blood , and for two generations there had been no warfare south of the Alps . For the moment men 's minds were turned to the great events going forward in France . It had not yet occurred to the Italians that the recoil of these events might be felt among themselves . They were simply amused spectators , roused at last to the significance of the show , but never dreaming that they might soon be called from the wings to the footlights . To de Crucis , however , the possibility of such a call was already present , and it was he who pressed the Duke to return to his post . A deep reluctance held Odo back . He would have liked to linger on in the monastery , leading the tranquil yet busy life of the monks , and trying to read the baffling riddle of its completeness . At that moment it seemed to him of vastly more importance to discover the exact nature of the soul -- whether it was in fact a metaphysical entity , as these men believed , or a mere secretion of the brain , as he had been taught to think -- than to go back and govern his people . For what mattered the rest , if he had been mistaken about the soul ? With a start he realised that he was going as his cousin had gone -- that this was but another form of the fatal lethargy that hung upon his race . An effort of the will drew him back to Pianura , and made him resume the semblance of authority ; but it carried him no farther . Trescorre ostensibly became prime minister , and in reality remained the head of the state . The Duke was present at the cabinet meetings but took no part in the direction of affairs . His mind was lost in a maze of metaphysical speculations ; and even these served him merely as some cunningly - contrived toy with which to trick his leisure . His revocation of the charter had necessarily separated him from Gamba and the advanced liberals . He knew that the hunchback , ever scornful of expediency , charged him with disloyalty to the people ; but such charges could no longer wound . The events following the Duke 's birthday had served to crystallise the schemes of the little liberal group , and they now formed a campaign of active opposition to the government , attacking it by means of pamphlets and lampoons , and by such public speaking as the police allowed . The new professors of the University , ardently in sympathy with the constitutional movement , used their lectures as means of political teaching , and the old stronghold of dogma became the centre of destructive criticism . But as yet these ideas formed but a single live point in the general numbness . Two years passed in this way . North of the Alps , all Europe was convulsed , while Italy was still but a sleeper who tosses in his sleep . In the two Sicilies , the arrogance and perfidy of the government gave a few martyrs to the cause , and in Bologna there was a brief revolutionary outbreak ; but for the most part the Italian states were sinking into inanition . Venice , by recalling her fleet from Greece , let fall the dominion of the sea . Twenty years earlier Genoa had basely yielded Corsica to France . The Pope condemned the French for their outrages on religion , and his subjects murdered Basseville , the agent of the new republic . The sympathies and impulses of the various states were as contradictory as they were ineffectual . Meanwhile , in France , Europe was trying to solve at a stroke the problems of a thousand years . All the repressed passions which civilisation had sought , however imperfectly , to curb , stalked abroad destructive as flood and fire . The great generation of the Encyclopaedists had passed away , and the teachings of Rousseau had prevailed over those of Montesquieu and Voltaire . The sober sense of the economists was swept aside by the sound and fury of the demagogues , and France was become a very Babel of tongues . The old malady of words had swept over the world like a pestilence . To the little Italian courts , still dozing in fancied security under the wing of Bourbon and Hapsburg suzerains , these rumours were borne by the wild flight of emigres -- dead leaves loosened by the first blast of the storm . Month by month they poured across the Alps in ever - increasing numbers , bringing confused contradictory tales of anarchy and outrage . Among those whom chance thus carried to Pianura were certain familiars of the Duke 's earlier life -- the Count Alfieri and his royal mistress , flying from Paris , and arriving breathless with the tale of their private injuries . To the poet of revolt this sudden realisation of his doctrines seemed in fact a purely personal outrage . It was as though a man writing an epic poem on an earthquake should suddenly find himself engulphed . To Alfieri the downfall of the French monarchy and the triumph of democratic ideas meant simply that his French investments had shrunk to nothing , and that he , the greatest poet of the age , had been obliged , at an immense sacrifice of personal dignity , to plead with a drunken mob for leave to escape from Paris . To the wider aspect of the "
175088	175135	175139	175142	instigators of false liberty	8034	" as he called it , his eyes remained obstinately closed . He viewed the whole revolutionary movement as a conspiracy against his comfort , and boasted that during his enforced residence in France he had not so much as exchanged a word with one of the "
175144	177215	175139	175142	instigators of false liberty	8034	" who , by trying to put into action the principles taught in his previous works , had so grievously interfered with the composition of fresh masterpieces . The royal pretensions of the Countess of Albany -- pretentions affirmed rather than abated as the tide of revolution rose -- made it impossible that she should be received at the court of Pianura ; but the Duke found a mild entertainment in Alfieri 's company . The poet 's revulsion of feeling seemed to Odo like the ironic laughter of the fates . His thoughts returned to the midnight meetings of the Honey Bees , and to the first vision of that face which men had lain down their lives to see . Men had looked on that face since then , and its horror was reflected in their own . Other fugitives to Pianura brought another impression of events -- that comic note which life , the supreme dramatic artist , never omits from her tragedies . These were the Duke 's old friend the Marquis de Coeur - Volant , fleeing from his chateau as the peasants put the torch to it , and arriving in Pianura destitute , gouty and middle - aged , but imperturbable and epigrammatic as ever . With him came his Marquise , a dark - eyed lady , stout to unwieldiness and much given to devotion , in whom it was whispered ( though he introduced her as the daughter of a Venetian Senator ) that a reminiscent eye might still detect the outline of the gracefullest Columbine who had ever flitted across the Italian stage . These visitors were lodged by the Duke 's kindness in the Palazzo Cerveno , near the ducal residence ; and though the ladies of Pianura were inclined to look askance on the Marquise 's genealogy , yet his Highness 's condescension , and her own edifying piety , had soon allayed these scruples , and the salon of Madame de Coeur - Volant became the rival of Madame d'Albany 's . It was , in fact , the more entertaining of the two ; for , in spite of his lady 's austere views , the Marquis retained that gift of social flexibility that was already becoming the tradition of a happier day . To the Marquis , indeed , the revolution was execrable not so much because of the hardships it inflicted , as because it was the forerunner of social dissolution -- the breaking - up of the regime which had made manners the highest morality , and conversation the chief end of man . He could have lived gaily on a crust in good company and amid smiling faces ; but the social deficiencies of Pianura were more difficult to endure than any material privation . In Italy , as the Marquis had more than once remarked , people loved , gambled , wrote poetry , and patronised the arts ; but , alas , they did not converse . Coeur - Volant could not conceal from his Highness that there was no conversation in Pianura ; but he did his best to fill the void by the constant exercise of his own gift in that direction , and to Odo at least his talk seemed as good as it was copious . Misfortune had given a finer savour to the Marquis 's philosophy , and there was a kind of heroic grace in his undisturbed cultivation of the amenities . While the Marquis was struggling to preserve the conversational art , and Alfieri planning the savage revenge of the Misogallo , the course of affairs in France had gained a wilder impetus . The abolition of the nobility , the flight and capture of the King , his enforced declaration of war against Austria , the massacres of Avignon , the sack of the Tuileries -- such events seemed incredible enough till the next had crowded them out of mind . The new year rose in blood and mounted to a bloodier noon . All the old defences were falling . Religion , monarchy , law , were sucked down into the whirlpool of liberated passions . Across that sanguinary scene passed , like a mocking ghost , the philosophers ' vision of the perfectibility of man . Man was free at last -- freer than his would - be liberators had ever dreamed of making him -- and he used his freedom like a beast . For the multitude had risen -- that multitude which no man could number , which even the demagogues who ranted in its name had never seriously reckoned with -- that dim , grovelling indistinguishable mass on which the whole social structure rested . It was as though the very soil moved , rising in mountains or yawning in chasms about the feet of those who had so long securely battened on it . The earth shook , the sun and moon were darkened , and the people , the terrible unknown people , had put in the sickle to the harvest . Italy roused herself at last . The emissaries of the new France were swarming across the Alps , pervading the peninsula as the Jesuits had once pervaded Europe ; and in the mind of a young general of the republican army visions of Italian conquest were already forming . In Pianura the revolutionary agents found a strong republican party headed by Gamba and his friends , and a government weakened by debt and dissensions . The air was thick with intrigue . The little army could no longer be counted on , and a prolonged bread - riot had driven Trescorre out of the ministry and compelled the Duke to appoint Andreoni in his place . Behind Andreoni stood Gamba and the radicals . There could be no doubt which way the fortunes of the duchy tended . The Duke 's would - be protectors , Austria and the Holy See , were too busy organising the hasty coalition of the powers to come to his aid , had he cared to call on them . But to do so would have been but another way of annihilation . To preserve the individuality of his state , or to merge it in the vision of a United Italy , seemed to him the only alternatives worth fighting for . The former was a futile dream , the latter seemed for a brief moment possible . Piedmont , ever loyal to the monarchical principle , was calling on her sister states to arm themselves against the French invasion . But the response was reluctant and uncertain . Private ambitions and petty jealousies hampered every attempt at union . Austria , the Bourbons and the Holy See held the Italian principalities in a network of conflicting interests and obligations that rendered free action impossible . Sadly Victor Amadeus armed himself alone against the enemy . Under such conditions Odo could do little to direct the course of events . They had passed into more powerful hands than his . But he could at least declare himself for or against the mighty impulse which was behind them . The ideas he had striven for had triumphed at last , and his surest hold on authority was to share openly in their triumph . A profound horror dragged him back . The new principles were not those for which he had striven . The goddess of the new worship was but a bloody Maenad who had borrowed the attributes of freedom . He could not bow the knee in such a charnel - house . Tranquilly , resolutely , he took up the policy of repression . He knew the attempt was foredoomed to failure , but that made no difference now : he was simply acting out the inevitable . The last act came with unexpected suddenness . The Duke woke one morning to find the citadel in the possession of the people . The impregnable stronghold of Bracciaforte was in the hands of the serfs whose fathers had toiled to build it , and the last descendant of Bracciaforte was virtually a prisoner in his palace . The revolution took place quietly , without violence or bloodshed . Andreoni waited on the Duke , and a cabinet - council was summoned . The ministers affected to have yielded reluctantly to popular pressure . All they asked was a constitution and the assurance that no resistance would be offered to the French . The Duke requested a few hours for deliberation . Left alone , he summoned the Duchess 's chamberlain . The ducal pair no longer met save on occasions of state : they had not exchanged a word since the death of Fulvia Vivaldi . Odo sent word to her Highness that he could no longer answer for her security while she remained in the duchy , and that he begged her to leave immediately for Vienna . She replied that she was obliged for his warning , but that while he remained in Pianura her place was at his side . It was the answer he had expected -- he had never doubted her courage -- but it was essential to his course that she should leave the duchy without delay , and after a moment 's reflection he wrote a letter in which he informed her that he must insist on her obedience . No answer was returned , but he learned that she had turned white , and tearing the letter in shreds had called for her travelling - carriage within the hour . He sent to enquire when he might take leave of her , but she excused herself on the plea of indisposition , and before nightfall he heard the departing rattle of her wheels . He immediately summoned Andreoni and announced his unconditional refusal of the terms proposed to him . He would not give a constitution or promise allegiance to the French . The minister withdrew , and Odo was left alone . He had dismissed his gentlemen , and as he sat in his closet a sense of deathlike isolation came over him . Never had the palace seemed so silent or so vast . He had not a friend to turn to . De Crucis was in Germany , and Trescorre , it was reported , had privately attended the Duchess in her flight . The waves of destiny seemed closing over Odo , and the circumstances of his past rose , poignant and vivid , before his drowning sight . And suddenly , in that moment of failure and abandonment , it seemed to him again that life was worth the living . His indifference fell from him like a garment . The old passion of action awoke and he felt a new warmth in his breast . After all , the struggle was not yet over : though Piedmont had called in vain on the Italian states , an Italian sword might still be drawn in her service . If his people would not follow him against France he could still march against her alone . Old memories hummed in him at the thought . He recalled how his Piedmontese ancestors had gone forth against the same foe , and the stout Donnaz blood began to bubble in his veins . A knock roused him and Gamba entered by the private way . His appearance was not unexpected to Odo , and served only to reinforce his new - found energy . He felt that the issue was at hand . As he expected , Gamba had been sent to put before him more forcibly and unceremoniously the veiled threat of the ministers . But the hunchback had come also to plead with his master in his own name , and in the name of the ideas for which they had once laboured together . He could not believe that the Duke 's reaction was more than momentary . He could not calculate the strength of the old associations which , now that the tide had set the other way , were dragging Odo back to the beliefs and traditions of his caste . The Duke listened in silence ; then he said : "
177234	177264	177265	177265	Your	8035	" He rose from his seat in token of dismissal . The moment was painful to both men . Gamba drew nearer and fell at the Duke 's feet . "
177268	177272	177265	177265	Your	8035	" he said , "
177313	177324	177329	177329	you	8035	" The Duke looked at him with a musing smile . "
177338	177342	177329	177329	you	8035	" he said . "
177385	177416	177417	177417	Your	8035	" Gamba was silent a moment . He turned aside into the embrasure of the window , and when he spoke again it was in a voice broken with grief . "
177420	177424	177417	177417	Your	8035	" he said , "
177458	177473	177474	177474	We	8042	" The Duke made no sign , and Gamba went on with gathering anguish : "
177490	177491	177484	177485	your Highness	8397	" "
177500	177517	177484	177485	your Highness	8397	" Odo interposed . He went up to Gamba and laid a hand on his shoulder . "
177523	177527	177521	177521	man	2185	" he said . "
177541	177571	177572	177573	Your Highness	8397	" The hunchback burst into tears . Odo , with his arms crossed , stood leaning against the window . The other 's anguish seemed to deepen his detachment . "
177577	177588	177575	177575	your	8035	" Gamba stammered . The Duke made an impatient gesture . "
177595	177607	177608	177608	We	8050	" he said . Gamba fell back with a profound bow . "
177620	177624	177608	177608	We	8050	" he said . "
177629	177651	177652	177653	Your Highness	8397	" Odo returned with a faint sneer . Gamba flushed to the temples , but the retort died on his lips . "
177655	177664	177652	177653	Your Highness	8397	" he said , scarce above a whisper , "
