10510	10514	10516	10517	the undertaker	486	“ Think so ? ”
10533	10547	10516	10517	the undertaker	486	“ The prices allowed by the board are very small , Mr. Bumble . ”
10548	10554	10556	10557	the beadle	389	“ So are the coffins , ”
10601	10609	10610	10610	he	141	“ Well , well , Mr. Bumble , ”
10615	10680	10610	10610	he	141	“ there ’s no denying that , since the new system of feeding has come in , the coffins are something narrower and more shallow than they used to be ; but we must have some profit , Mr. Bumble . Well - seasoned timber is an expensive article , sir ; and all the iron handles come , by canal , from Birmingham . ”
10681	10686	10688	10689	Mr. Bumble	128	“ Well , well , ”
10691	10708	10688	10689	Mr. Bumble	128	“ every trade has its drawbacks . A fair profit is , of course , allowable . ”
10709	10716	10718	10719	the undertaker	486	“ Of course , of course , ”
10721	10758	10718	10719	the undertaker	486	“ and if I do n’t get a profit upon this or that particular article , why , I make it up in the long - run , you see — he ! he ! he ! ”
10759	10763	10765	10766	Mr. Bumble	128	“ Just so , ”
10768	10774	10776	10777	the undertaker	486	“ Though I must say , ”
10790	10890	10776	10777	the undertaker	486	“ though I must say , Mr. Bumble , that I have to contend against one very great disadvantage : which is , that all the stout people go off the quickest . The people who have been better off , and have paid rates for many years , are the first to sink when they come into the house ; and let me tell you , Mr. Bumble , that three or four inches over one ’s calculation makes a great hole in one ’s profits : especially when one has a family to provide for , sir . ”
10953	10958	10960	10961	Mr. Bumble	128	“ By the bye , ”
10963	11013	10960	10961	Mr. Bumble	128	“ you do n’t know anybody who wants a boy , do you ? A porochial ’ prentis , who is at present a dead - weight ; a millstone , as I may say , round the porochial throat ? Liberal terms , Mr. Sowerberry , liberal terms ? ”

11053	11056	11058	11059	the undertaker	486	“ Gadso ! ”
11075	11113	11058	11059	the undertaker	486	“ that ’s just the very thing I wanted to speak to you about . You know — dear me , what a very elegant button this is , Mr. Bumble ! I never noticed it before . ”
11114	11123	11125	11126	the beadle	389	“ Yes , I think it rather pretty , ”
11141	11206	11125	11126	the beadle	389	“ The die is the same as the porochial seal — the Good Samaritan healing the sick and bruised man . The board presented it to me on Newyear ’s morning , Mr. Sowerberry . I put it on , I remember , for the first time , to attend the inquest on that reduced tradesman , who died in a doorway at midnight . ”
11207	11211	11213	11214	the undertaker	486	“ I recollect , ”
11216	11245	11213	11214	the undertaker	486	“ The jury brought it in , ‘ Died from exposure to the cold , and want of the common necessaries of life , ’ did n’t they ? ”
11250	11262	11264	11265	the undertaker	486	“ And they made it a special verdict , I think , ”
11267	11283	11264	11265	the undertaker	486	“ by adding some words to the effect , that if the relieving officer had — ”
11284	11289	11291	11292	the beadle	389	“ Tush ! Foolery ! ”
11294	11315	11291	11292	the beadle	389	“ If the board attended to all the nonsense that ignorant jurymen talk , they ’d have enough to do . ”
11316	11320	11322	11323	the undertaker	486	“ Very true , ”
11325	11330	11322	11323	the undertaker	486	“ they would indeed . ”
11331	11334	11336	11337	Mr. Bumble	128	“ Juries , ”
11355	11365	11336	11337	Mr. Bumble	128	“ juries is ineddicated , vulgar , grovelling wretches . ”
11366	11371	11373	11374	the undertaker	486	“ So they are , ”
11376	11391	11393	11394	the beadle	389	“ They have n’t no more philosophy nor political economy about ’em than that , ”
11401	11407	11409	11410	the undertaker	486	“ No more they have , ”
11412	11417	11419	11420	the beadle	389	“ I despise ’em , ”
11429	11434	11436	11437	the undertaker	486	“ So do I , ”
11439	11462	11464	11465	the beadle	389	“ And I only wish we ’d a jury of the independent sort , in the house for a week or two , ”
11467	11484	11464	11465	the beadle	389	“ the rules and regulations of the board would soon bring their spirit down for ’em . ”
11485	11492	11494	11495	the undertaker	486	“ Let ’em alone for that , ”
11566	11574	11557	11558	the undertaker	486	“ Well ; what about the boy ? ”
11575	11578	11580	11581	the undertaker	486	“ Oh ! ”
11583	11603	11580	11581	the undertaker	486	“ why , you know , Mr. Bumble , I pay a good deal towards the poor ’s rates . ”
11604	11607	11609	11610	Mr. Bumble	128	“ Hem ! ”
11612	11615	11609	11610	Mr. Bumble	128	“ Well ? ”

11624	11667	11621	11622	the undertaker	486	“ I was thinking that if I pay so much towards ’em , I ’ve a right to get as much out of ’em as I can , Mr. Bumble ; and so — I think I ’ll take the boy myself . ”

12331	12334	12336	12337	Mr. Bumble	128	“ Well ! ”

Good , strong , wholesome medicine , as was given with great success to two Irish labourers and a coal - heaver , only a week before — sent ’em for nothing , with a blackin’-bottle in,—and he sends back word that she sha n’t take it , sir ! ”

17096	17242	17243	17243	He	855	“ kneel down , kneel down — kneel round her , every one of you , and mark my words ! I say she was starved to death . I never knew how bad she was , till the fever came upon her ; and then her bones were starting through the skin . There was neither fire nor candle ; she died in the dark — in the dark ! She could n’t even see her children ’s faces , though we heard her gasping out their names . I begged for her in the streets : and they sent me to prison . When I came back , she was dying ; and all the blood in my heart has dried up , for they starved her to death . I swear it before the God that saw it ! They starved her ! ”

You ’ve raised a artificial soul and spirit in him , ma’am unbecoming a person of his condition : as the board , Mrs. Sowerberry , who are practical philosophers , will tell you . What have paupers to do with soul or spirit ? It ’s quite enough that we let ’em have live bodies . If you had kept the boy on gruel , ma’am , this would never have happened . ”

He comes of a bad family . Excitable natures , Mrs. Sowerberry ! Both the nurse and doctor said , that that mother of his made her way here , against difficulties and pain that would have killed any well - disposed woman , weeks before . ”

35257	35270	35272	35273	the clerk	884	“ How do you propose to deal with the case , sir ? ”
35279	35282	35284	35285	Mr. Fang	172	“ Summarily , ”
35287	35304	35284	35285	Mr. Fang	172	“ He stands committed for three months — hard labour of course . Clear the office . ”
35359	35378	35380	35382	the new comer	1486	“ Stop , stop ! do n’t take him away ! For Heaven ’s sake stop a moment ! ”
35488	35506	35508	35509	Mr. Fang	172	“ What is this ? Who is this ? Turn this man out . Clear the office ! ”
35511	35518	35520	35521	the man	843	“ I _ will _ speak , ”
35523	35571	35520	35521	the man	843	“ I will not be turned out . I saw it all . I keep the book - stall . I demand to be sworn . I will not be put down . Mr. Fang , you must hear me . You must not refuse , sir . ”
35595	35600	35602	35603	Mr. Fang	172	“ Swear the man , ”
35611	35623	35602	35603	Mr. Fang	172	“ Now , man , what have you got to say ? ”
35624	35627	35629	35630	the man	843	“ This , ”
35632	35687	35629	35630	the man	843	“ I saw three boys : two others and the prisoner here : loitering on the opposite side of the way , when this gentleman was reading . The robbery was committed by another boy . I saw it done ; and I saw that this boy was perfectly amazed and stupified by it . ”
35719	35728	35730	35730	Fang	172	“ Why did n’t you come here before ? ”
35736	35747	35749	35750	the man	843	“ I had n’t a soul to mind the shop , ”
35752	35784	35749	35750	the man	843	“ Everybody who could have helped me , had joined in the pursuit . I could get nobody till five minutes ago ; and I ’ve run here all the way . ”
35785	35794	35796	35796	Fang	172	“ The prosecutor was reading , was he ? ”
35802	35805	35807	35808	the man	843	“ Yes , ”
35810	35820	35807	35808	the man	843	“ The very book he has in his hand . ”
35821	35829	35831	35831	Fang	172	“ Oh , that book , eh ? ”
35833	35839	35831	35831	Fang	172	“ Is it paid for ? ”
35840	35847	35849	35850	the man	843	“ No , it is not , ”
35856	35866	35868	35871	the absent old gentleman	1501	“ Dear me , I forgot all about it ! ”
35875	35888	35890	35890	Fang	172	“ A nice person to prefer a charge against a poor boy ! ”
35900	35967	35890	35890	Fang	172	“ I consider , sir , that you have obtained possession of that book , under very suspicious and disreputable circumstances ; and you may think yourself very fortunate that the owner of the property declines to prosecute . Let this be a lesson to you , my man , or the law will overtake you yet . The boy is discharged . Clear the office ! ”
35968	35974	35976	35978	the old gentleman	597	“ D — n me ! ”
35992	36001	35985	35985	he	597	“ d — n me ! I ’ll — ”

36113	36120	36122	36123	Mr. Brownlow	173	“ Poor boy , poor boy ! ”
36129	36140	36122	36123	Mr. Brownlow	173	“ Call a coach , somebody , pray . Directly ! ”
36168	36174	36176	36180	the book - stall keeper	1507	“ May I accompany you ? ”
36185	36195	36197	36198	Mr. Brownlow	173	“ Bless me , yes , my dear sir , ”
36201	36230	36197	36198	Mr. Brownlow	173	“ I forgot you . Dear , dear ! I have this unhappy book still ! Jump in . Poor fellow ! There ’s no time to lose . ”
36503	36516	36518	36518	Oliver	123	“ What room is this ? Where have I been brought to ? ”
36520	36532	36518	36518	Oliver	123	“ This is not the place I went to sleep in . ”
36604	36610	36612	36614	the old lady	1080	“ Hush , my dear , ”
36617	36655	36612	36614	the old lady	1080	“ You must be very quiet , or you will be ill again ; and you have been very bad,—as bad as bad could be , pretty nigh . Lie down again ; there ’s a dear ! ”
36712	36716	36718	36720	the old lady	1080	“ Save us ! ”
36728	36761	36725	36725	her	1080	“ What a grateful little dear it is . Pretty creetur ! What would his mother feel if she had sat by him as I have , and could see him now ! ”
36762	36769	36771	36771	Oliver	123	“ Perhaps she does see me , ”
36778	36794	36771	36771	Oliver	123	“ perhaps she has sat by me . I almost feel as if she had . ”
36795	36804	36806	36808	the old lady	1080	“ That was the fever , my dear , ”
36811	36817	36819	36819	Oliver	123	“ I suppose it was , ”
36821	36884	36886	36886	Oliver	123	“ because heaven is a long way off ; and they are too happy there , to come down to the bedside of a poor boy . But if she knew I was ill , she must have pitied me , even there ; for she was very ill herself before she died . She ca n’t know anything about me though , ”
36893	36925	36886	36886	Oliver	123	“ If she had seen me hurt , it would have made her sorrowful ; and her face has always looked sweet and happy , when I have dreamed of her . ”
37099	37116	37118	37119	the gentleman	4594	“ You _ are _ a great deal better , are you not , my dear ? ”
37121	37129	37131	37131	Oliver	123	“ Yes , thank you , sir , ”
37133	37141	37143	37144	the gentleman	4594	“ Yes , I know you are , ”
37146	37155	37143	37144	the gentleman	4594	“ You ’re hungry too , an’t you ? ”
37156	37161	37163	37163	Oliver	123	“ No , sir , ”
37165	37168	37170	37171	the gentleman	4594	“ Hem ! ”
37173	37190	37192	37193	the gentleman	4594	“ No , I know you ’re not . He is not hungry , Mrs. Bedwin , ”
37235	37247	37249	37250	the doctor	4910	“ You feel sleepy , do n’t you , my dear ? ”
37252	37257	37259	37259	Oliver	123	“ No , sir , ”
37261	37264	37266	37267	the doctor	4910	“ No , ”
37277	37289	37266	37267	the doctor	4910	“ You ’re not sleepy . Nor thirsty . Are you ? ”
37290	37298	37300	37300	Oliver	123	“ Yes , sir , rather thirsty , ”
37302	37311	37313	37314	the doctor	4910	“ Just as I expected , Mrs. Bedwin , ”
37316	37373	37313	37314	the doctor	4910	“ It ’s very natural that he should be thirsty . You may give him a little tea , ma’am , and some dry toast without any butter . Do n’t keep him too warm , ma’am ; but be careful that you do n’t let him be too cold ; will you have the goodness ? ”
37888	37896	37898	37900	the old lady	1080	“ Never mind me , my dear , ”
37902	37926	37898	37900	the old lady	1080	“ I ’m only having a regular good cry . There ; it ’s all over now ; and I ’m quite comfortable . ”
37927	37939	37941	37941	Oliver	123	“ You ’re very , very kind to me , ma’am , ”
37943	37954	37956	37958	the old lady	1080	“ Well , never you mind that , my dear , ”
37960	38017	37956	37958	the old lady	1080	“ that ’s got nothing to do with your broth ; and it ’s full time you had it ; for the doctor says Mr. Brownlow may come in to see you this morning ; and we must get up our best looks , because the better we look , the more he ’ll be pleased . ”
38073	38082	38084	38086	the old lady	1080	“ Are you fond of pictures , dear ? ”
38113	38122	38124	38124	Oliver	123	“ I do n’t quite know , ma’am , ”
38134	38156	38124	38124	Oliver	123	“ I have seen so few that I hardly know . What a beautiful , mild face that lady ’s is ! ”
38157	38160	38162	38164	the old lady	1080	“ Ah ! ”
38166	38216	38218	38220	the old lady	1080	“ painters always make ladies out prettier than they are , or they would n’t get any custom , child . The man that invented the machine for taking likenesses might have known _ that _ would never succeed ; it ’s a deal too honest . A deal , ”
38230	38240	38242	38242	Oliver	123	“ Is — is that a likeness , ma’am ? ”
38244	38247	38249	38251	the old lady	1080	“ Yes , ”
38262	38268	38249	38251	the old lady	1080	“ that ’s a portrait . ”
38269	38274	38276	38276	Oliver	123	“ Whose , ma’am ? ”
38278	38291	38293	38295	the old lady	1080	“ Why , really , my dear , I do n’t know , ”
38303	38329	38293	38295	the old lady	1080	“ It ’s not a likeness of anybody that you or I know , I expect . It seems to strike your fancy , dear . ”
38330	38336	38338	38338	Oliver	123	“ It is so pretty , ”
38340	38351	38353	38355	the old lady	1080	“ Why , sure you ’re not afraid of it ? ”
38374	38380	38382	38382	Oliver	123	“ Oh no , no , ”
38385	38410	38412	38412	Oliver	123	“ but the eyes look so sorrowful ; and where I sit , they seem fixed upon me . It makes my heart beat , ”
38418	38436	38412	38412	Oliver	123	“ as if it was alive , and wanted to speak to me , but could n’t . ”
38437	38442	38444	38446	the old lady	1080	“ Lord save us ! ”
38450	38490	38492	38494	the old lady	1080	“ do n’t talk in that way , child . You ’re weak and nervous after your illness . Let me wheel your chair round to the other side ; and then you wo n’t see it . There ! ”
38503	38515	38492	38494	the old lady	1080	“ you do n’t see it now , at all events . ”
38619	38623	38625	38627	the old lady	1080	“ Come in , ”
38788	38795	38797	38798	Mr. Brownlow	173	“ Poor boy , poor boy ! ”

38824	38831	38833	38834	Mrs. Bedwin	178	“ I hope not , sir , ”
38836	38849	38833	38834	Mrs. Bedwin	178	“ Everything you have had , has been well aired , sir . ”
38850	38863	38865	38866	Mr. Brownlow	173	“ I do n’t know , Bedwin . I do n’t know , ”
38868	38896	38865	38866	Mr. Brownlow	173	“ I rather think I had a damp napkin at dinner - time yesterday ; but never mind that . How do you feel , my dear ? ”
38897	38903	38905	38905	Oliver	123	“ Very happy , sir , ”
38907	38921	38905	38905	Oliver	123	“ And very grateful indeed , sir , for your goodness to me . ”
38922	38926	38928	38929	Mr. Brownlow	173	“ Good boy , ”
38933	38948	38928	38929	Mr. Brownlow	173	“ Have you given him any nourishment , Bedwin ? Any slops , eh ? ”
38949	38963	38965	38966	Mrs. Bedwin	178	“ He has just had a basin of beautiful strong broth , sir , ”
39001	39004	39006	39007	Mr. Brownlow	173	“ Ugh ! ”
39014	39041	39006	39007	Mr. Brownlow	173	“ a couple of glasses of port wine would have done him a great deal more good . Would n’t they , Tom White , eh ? ”

39101	39113	39097	39099	the old gentleman	597	“ What made you tell the magistrate your name was White ? ”
39114	39123	39125	39125	Oliver	179	“ I never told him so , sir , ”
39168	39172	39174	39175	Mr. Brownlow	173	“ Some mistake , ”

40004	40010	40012	40013	the Dodger	1138	“ What ’s the matter ? ”
40015	40022	40024	40025	Charley Bates	164	“ Ha ! ha ! ha ! ”
40027	40032	40034	40035	the Dodger	1138	“ Hold your noise , ”

40063	40128	40061	40061	Charley	164	“ I ca n’t help it ! To see him splitting away at that pace , and cutting round the corners , and knocking up again ’ the posts , and starting on again as if he was made of iron as well as them , and me with the wipe in my pocket , singing out arter him — oh , my eye ! ”
40167	40173	40175	40176	the Dodger	1138	“ What ’ll Fagin say ? ”

40968	40980	40953	40953	he	164	“ Why , what the blazes is in the wind now ! ”
40986	41108	40953	40953	he	164	“ Who pitched that ’ ere at me ? It ’s well it ’s the beer , and not the pot , as hit me , or I ’d have settled somebody . I might have know’d , as nobody but an infernal , rich , plundering , thundering old Jew could afford to throw away any drink but water — and not that , unless he done the River Company every quarter . Wot ’s it all about , Fagin ? D — me , if my neck - handkercher an’t lined with beer ! Come in , you sneaking warmint ; wot are you stopping outside for , as if you was ashamed of your master ! Come in ! ”

41448	41522	41445	41445	himself	843	“ I wonder they do n’t murder you ! I would if I was them . If I ’d been your ’ prentice , I ’d have done it long ago , and — no , I could n’t have sold you afterwards , for you ’re fit for nothing but keeping as a curiousity of ugliness in a glass bottle , and I suppose they do n’t blow glass bottles large enough . ”

41616	41621	41623	41623	Sikes	149	“ Perhaps I am , ”
41625	41658	41623	41623	Sikes	149	“ I should think you was rather out of sorts too , unless you mean as little harm when you throw pewter pots about , as you do when you blab and — ”

41754	41763	41765	41766	Mr. Sikes	149	“ And mind you do n’t poison it , ”
41906	41911	41913	41914	the Jew	1184	“ I ’m afraid , ”

41953	41962	41964	41965	the Jew	1184	“ And I ’m afraid , you see , ”
41985	42026	42027	42028	The man	843	so,—“I’m afraid that , if the game was up with us , it might be up with a good many more , and that it would come out rather worse for you than it would for me , my dear . ”
42121	42134	42136	42137	Mr. Sikes	149	“ Somebody must find out wot ’s been done at the office , ”
42157	42178	42180	42181	Mr. Sikes	149	“ If he has n’t peached , and is committed , there ’s no fear till he comes out again , ”
42183	42201	42180	42181	Mr. Sikes	149	“ and then he must be taken care on . You must get hold of him somehow . ”
42353	42358	42360	42361	the Jew	1184	“ The very thing ! ”
42363	42375	42360	42361	the Jew	1184	“ Bet will go ; wo n’t you , my dear ? ”
42376	42380	42382	42384	the young lady	1668	“ Where s ? ”
42386	42397	42399	42400	the Jew	1184	“ Only just up to the office , my dear , ”
42435	42437	42425	42425	she	1668	“ blessed ”
42528	42534	42536	42537	the Jew	1184	“ Nancy , my dear , ”
42543	42551	42536	42537	the Jew	1184	“ what do _ you _ say ? ”
42552	42572	42574	42574	Nancy	167	“ That it wo n’t do ; so it ’s no use a - trying it on , Fagin , ”
42576	42584	42586	42587	Mr. Sikes	183	“ What do you mean by that ? ”
42596	42603	42605	42606	the lady	711	“ What I say , Bill , ”
42609	42621	42623	42624	Mr. Sikes	183	“ Why , you ’re just the very person for it , ”
42626	42635	42623	42624	Mr. Sikes	183	“ nobody about here knows anything of you . ”
42636	42648	42650	42650	Nancy	167	“ And as I do n’t want ’em to , neither , ”
42657	42670	42650	42650	Nancy	167	“ it ’s rather more no than yes with me , Bill . ”
42671	42678	42680	42680	Sikes	149	“ She ’ll go , Fagin , ”
42682	42691	42693	42693	Nancy	167	“ No , she wo n’t , Fagin , ”
42695	42703	42705	42705	Sikes	149	“ Yes , she will , Fagin , ”
42833	42841	42843	42844	the Jew	1184	“ Stop a minute , my dear , ”
42853	42868	42843	42844	the Jew	1184	“ Carry that in one hand . It looks more respectable , my dear . ”
42869	42885	42887	42887	Sikes	149	“ Give her a door - key to carry in her t’other one , Fagin , ”
42889	42897	42887	42887	Sikes	149	“ it looks real and genivine like . ”
42898	42910	42912	42913	the Jew	1184	“ Yes , yes , my dear , so it does , ”
42933	42946	42948	42949	the Jew	1184	“ There ; very good ! Very good indeed , my dear ! ”
42955	42972	42974	42974	Nancy	167	“ Oh , my brother ! My poor , dear , sweet , innocent little brother ! ”
42997	43041	42974	42974	Nancy	167	“ What has become of him ! Where have they taken him to ! Oh , do have pity , and tell me what ’s been done with the dear boy , gentlemen ; do , gentlemen , if you please , gentlemen ! ”
43080	43092	43094	43095	the Jew	1184	“ Ah , she ’s a clever girl , my dears , ”
43127	43136	43138	43139	Mr. Sikes	149	“ She ’s a honour to her sex , ”
43154	43168	43150	43150	his	149	“ Here ’s her health , and wishing they was all like her ! ”
43271	43276	43278	43278	Nancy	167	“ Nolly , dear ? ”
43284	43287	43278	43278	Nancy	167	“ Nolly ? ”
43407	43410	43395	43395	Nancy	167	“ Well ! ”
43418	43426	43428	43428	Nancy	167	“ Is there a little boy here ? ”
43435	43438	43428	43428	Nancy	167	“ No , ”
43443	43447	43428	43428	Nancy	167	“ God forbid . ”
43594	43604	43606	43608	the old man	1217	“ I have n’t got him , my dear , ”
43610	43615	43617	43617	Nancy	167	“ Where is he ? ”
43624	43633	43635	43636	the officer	1376	“ Why , the gentleman ’s got him , ”
43638	43650	43652	43652	Nancy	167	“ What gentleman ! Oh , gracious heavens ! What gentleman ? ”
43850	43866	43868	43869	the Jew	1184	“ We must know where he is , my dears ; he must be found , ”
43873	43920	43922	43923	the Jew	1184	“ Charley , do nothing but skulk about , till you bring home some news of him ! Nancy , my dear , I must have him found . I trust to you , my dear,—to you and the Artful for everything ! Stay , stay , ”
43933	43971	43922	43923	the Jew	1184	“ there ’s money , my dears . I shall shut up this shop tonight . You ’ll know where to find me ! Do n’t stop here a minute . Not an instant , my dears ! ”
44037	44042	44043	44043	he	1184	“ Who ’s there ? ”
44050	44053	44058	44059	the Dodger	1138	“ Me ! ”
44067	44071	44073	44074	the Jew	1184	“ What now ? ”
44077	44091	44093	44094	the Dodger	1138	“ Is he to be kidnapped to the other ken , Nancy says ? ”
44096	44099	44101	44102	the Jew	1184	“ Yes , ”
44104	44134	44101	44102	the Jew	1184	“ wherever she lays hands on him . Find him , find him out , that ’s all . I shall know what to do next ; never fear . ”
44150	44158	44160	44161	the Jew	1184	“ He has not peached so far , ”
44168	44187	44160	44161	the Jew	1184	“ If he means to blab us among his new friends , we may stop his mouth yet . ”
44358	44361	44363	44364	the housekeeper	1741	“ Ah ! ”
44374	44382	44363	44364	the housekeeper	1741	“ It is gone , you see . ”
44383	44390	44392	44392	Oliver	123	“ I see it is ma’am , ”
44394	44402	44392	44392	Oliver	123	“ Why have they taken it away ? ”
44403	44436	44438	44440	the old lady	1080	“ It has been taken down , child , because Mr. Brownlow said , that as it seemed to worry you , perhaps it might prevent your getting well , you know , ”
44442	44457	44459	44459	Oliver	123	“ Oh , no , indeed . It did n’t worry me , ma’am , ”
44461	44473	44459	44459	Oliver	123	“ I liked to see it . I quite loved it . ”
44474	44479	44481	44483	the old lady	1080	“ Well , well ! ”
44489	44526	44481	44483	the old lady	1080	“ you get well as fast as ever you can , dear , and it shall be hung up again . There ! I promise you that ! Now , let us talk about something else . ”
45050	45074	45076	45077	Mrs. Bedwin	178	“ Bless us , and save us ! Wash your hands , and let me part your hair nicely for you , child , ”
45079	45113	45076	45077	Mrs. Bedwin	178	“ Dear heart alive ! If we had known he would have asked for you , we would have put you a clean collar on , and made you as smart as sixpence ! ”
45348	45363	45365	45366	Mr. Brownlow	173	“ There are a good many books , are there not , my boy ? ”
45386	45393	45395	45395	Oliver	123	“ A great number , sir , ”
45397	45404	45395	45395	Oliver	123	“ I never saw so many . ”
45405	45416	45418	45420	the old gentleman	597	“ You shall read them , if you behave well , ”
45423	45458	45418	45420	the old gentleman	597	“ and you will like that , better than looking at the outsides,—that is , some cases ; because there are books of which the backs and covers are by far the best parts . ”
45459	45470	45472	45472	Oliver	123	“ I suppose they are those heavy ones , sir , ”
45490	45495	45497	45499	the old gentleman	597	“ Not always those , ”
45514	45546	45497	45499	the old gentleman	597	“ there are other equally heavy ones , though of a much smaller size . How should you like to grow up a clever man , and write books , eh ? ”
45547	45558	45560	45560	Oliver	123	“ I think I would rather read them , sir , ”
45562	45576	45578	45580	the old gentleman	597	“ What ! would n’t you like to be a book - writer ? ”
45646	45651	45653	45655	the old gentleman	597	“ Well , well , ”
45661	45694	45653	45655	the old gentleman	597	“ Do n’t be afraid ! We wo n’t make an author of you , while there ’s an honest trade to be learnt , or brick - making to turn to . ”
45695	45701	45703	45703	Oliver	123	“ Thank you , sir , ”
45740	45743	45745	45746	Mr. Brownlow	173	“ Now , ”
45776	45824	45772	45772	him	173	“ I want you to pay great attention , my boy , to what I am going to say . I shall talk to you without any reserve ; because I am sure you are well able to understand me , as many older persons would be . ”
45825	45843	45845	45845	Oliver	123	“ Oh , do n’t tell you are going to send me away , sir , pray ! ”
45859	45906	45845	45845	Oliver	123	“ Do n’t turn me out of doors to wander in the streets again . Let me stay here , and be a servant . Do n’t send me back to the wretched place I came from . Have mercy upon a poor boy , sir ! ”
45907	45912	45914	45916	the old gentleman	597	“ My dear child , ”
45928	45945	45914	45916	the old gentleman	597	“ you need not be afraid of my deserting you , unless you give me cause . ”
45946	45955	45957	45957	Oliver	123	“ I never , never will , sir , ”
45959	45964	45966	45968	the old gentleman	597	“ I hope not , ”
45970	46089	45966	45968	the old gentleman	597	“ I do not think you ever will . I have been deceived , before , in the objects whom I have endeavoured to benefit ; but I feel strongly disposed to trust you , nevertheless ; and I am more interested in your behalf than I can well account for , even to myself . The persons on whom I have bestowed my dearest love , lie deep in their graves ; but , although the happiness and delight of my life lie buried there too , I have not made a coffin of my heart , and sealed it up , forever , on my best affections . Deep affliction has but strengthened and refined them . ”
46125	46130	46132	46134	the old gentleman	597	“ Well , well ! ”
46144	46253	46132	46134	the old gentleman	597	“ I only say this , because you have a young heart ; and knowing that I have suffered great pain and sorrow , you will be more careful , perhaps , not to wound me again . You say you are an orphan , without a friend in the world ; all the inquiries I have been able to make , confirm the statement . Let me hear your story ; where you come from ; who brought you up ; and how you got into the company in which I found you . Speak the truth , and you shall not be friendless while I live . ”
46319	46325	46327	46328	Mr. Brownlow	173	“ Is he coming up ? ”
46330	46335	46337	46338	the servant	1790	“ Yes , sir , ”
46340	46368	46337	46338	the servant	1790	“ He asked if there were any muffins in the house ; and , when I told him yes , he said he had come to tea . ”
46420	46428	46430	46430	Oliver	123	“ Shall I go downstairs , sir ? ”
46432	46435	46437	46438	Mr. Brownlow	173	“ No , ”
46440	46448	46437	46438	Mr. Brownlow	173	“ I would rather you remained here . ”
46656	46733	46620	46620	he	123	“ Look here ! do you see this ! Is n’t it a most wonderful and extraordinary thing that I ca n’t call at a man ’s house but I find a piece of this poor surgeon ’s friend on the staircase ? I ’ve been lamed with orange - peel once , and I know orange - peel will be my death , or I ’ll be content to eat my own head , sir ! ”
46849	46858	46860	46861	Mr. Grimwig	1804	“ I ’ll eat my head , sir , ”
46870	46877	46864	46864	his	1804	“ Hallo ! what ’s that ! ”
46889	46902	46904	46905	Mr. Brownlow	173	“ This is young Oliver Twist , whom we were speaking about , ”
46910	46929	46931	46932	Mr. Grimwig	1805	“ You do n’t mean to say that ’s the boy who had the fever , I hope ? ”
46939	46950	46952	46953	Mr. Grimwig	1806	“ Wait a minute ! Do n’t speak ! Stop — ”
46970	47014	46952	46953	Mr. Grimwig	1806	“ that ’s the boy who had the orange ! If that ’s not the boy , sir , who had the orange , and threw this bit of peel upon the staircase , I ’ll eat my head , and his too . ”
47015	47026	47028	47029	Mr. Brownlow	173	“ No , no , he has not had one , ”
47033	47048	47028	47029	Mr. Brownlow	173	“ Come ! Put down your hat ; and speak to my young friend . ”
47049	47059	47061	47064	the irritable old gentleman	1807	“ I feel strongly on this subject , sir , ”
47071	47179	47061	47064	the irritable old gentleman	1807	“ There ’s always more or less orange - peel on the pavement in our street ; and I _ know _ it ’s put there by the surgeon ’s boy at the corner . A young woman stumbled over a bit last night , and fell against my garden - railings ; directly she got up I saw her look towards his infernal red lamp with the pantomime - light . ‘ Do n’t go to him , ’ I called out of the window , ‘ he ’s an assassin ! A man - trap ! ’ So he is . If he is not — ”
47275	47284	47286	47287	Mr. Grimwig	1810	“ That ’s the boy , is it ? ”
47292	47298	47300	47301	Mr. Brownlow	173	“ That ’s the boy , ”
47303	47310	47312	47313	Mr. Grimwig	1811	“ How are you , boy ? ”
47315	47326	47328	47328	Oliver	123	“ A great deal better , thank you , sir , ”
47382	47395	47397	47398	Mr. Brownlow	173	“ He is a nice - looking boy , is he not ? ”
47400	47406	47408	47409	Mr. Grimwig	1816	“ I do n’t know , ”
47413	47418	47408	47409	Mr. Grimwig	1816	“ Do n’t know ? ”
47419	47452	47397	47398	Mr. Brownlow	173	“ No . I do n’t know . I never see any difference in boys . I only knew two sort of boys . Mealy boys , and beef - faced boys . ”
47453	47459	47408	47409	Mr. Grimwig	1816	“ And which is Oliver ? ”
47460	47540	47408	47409	Mr. Grimwig	1816	“ Mealy . I know a friend who has a beef - faced boy ; a fine boy , they call him ; with a round head , and red cheeks , and glaring eyes ; a horrid boy ; with a body and limbs that appear to be swelling out of the seams of his blue clothes ; with the voice of a pilot , and the appetite of a wolf . I know him ! The wretch ! ”
47541	47544	47546	47547	Mr. Brownlow	173	“ Come , ”
47549	47568	47546	47547	Mr. Brownlow	173	“ these are not the characteristics of young Oliver Twist ; so he need n’t excite your wrath . ”
47569	47574	47576	47577	Mr. Grimwig	1817	“ They are not , ”
47579	47585	47576	47577	Mr. Grimwig	1817	“ He may have worse . ”
47604	47613	47615	47616	Mr. Grimwig	1819	“ He may have worse , I say , ”
47618	47702	47615	47616	Mr. Grimwig	1819	“ Where does he come from ! Who is he ? What is he ? He has had a fever . What of that ? Fevers are not peculiar to good people ; are they ? Bad people have fevers sometimes ; have n’t they , eh ? I knew a man who was hung in Jamaica for murdering his master . He had had a fever six times ; he was n’t recommended to mercy on that account . Pooh ! nonsense ! ”
47972	47997	47999	48002	Grimwig of Mr. Brownlow	173	“ And when are you going to hear a full , true , and particular account of the life and adventures of Oliver Twist ? ”
48022	48026	48028	48029	Mr. Brownlow	173	“ Tomorrow morning , ”
48031	48057	48028	48029	Mr. Brownlow	173	“ I would rather he was alone with me at the time . Come up to me tomorrow morning at ten o’clock , my dear . ”
48058	48063	48065	48065	Oliver	123	“ Yes , sir , ”
48087	48094	48096	48097	that gentleman	586	“ I ’ll tell you what , ”
48102	48127	48096	48097	that gentleman	586	“ he wo n’t come up to you tomorrow morning . I saw him hesitate . He is deceiving you , my good friend . ”
48128	48136	48138	48139	Mr. Brownlow	173	“ I ’ll swear he is not , ”
48143	48149	48151	48152	Mr. Grimwig	1834	“ If he is not , ”
48154	48158	48151	48152	Mr. Grimwig	1834	“ I ’ll — ”
48165	48178	48180	48181	Mr. Brownlow	173	“ I ’ll answer for that boy ’s truth with my life ! ”
48187	48197	48199	48200	Mr. Grimwig	1835	“ And I for his falsehood with my head ! ”
48207	48212	48214	48215	Mr. Brownlow	173	“ We shall see , ”
48222	48226	48228	48229	Mr. Grimwig	1836	“ We will , ”
48236	48240	48228	48229	Mr. Grimwig	1836	“ we will . ”
48300	48308	48310	48311	Mr. Brownlow	173	“ Stop the boy , Mrs. Bedwin ! ”
48313	48321	48310	48311	Mr. Brownlow	173	“ there is something to go back . ”
48322	48329	48331	48332	Mrs. Bedwin	178	“ He has gone , sir , ”
48334	48339	48341	48342	Mr. Brownlow	173	“ Call after him , ”
48344	48373	48341	48342	Mr. Brownlow	173	“ it ’s particular . He is a poor man , and they are not paid for . There are some books to be taken back , too . ”
48434	48445	48447	48448	Mr. Brownlow	173	“ Dear me , I am very sorry for that , ”
48450	48461	48447	48448	Mr. Brownlow	173	“ I particularly wished those books to be returned tonight . ”
48462	48468	48470	48471	Mr. Grimwig	1844	“ Send Oliver with them , ”
48478	48491	48470	48471	Mr. Grimwig	1844	“ he will be sure to deliver them safely , you know . ”
48492	48507	48509	48509	Oliver	123	“ Yes ; do let me take them , if you please , sir , ”
48511	48521	48509	48509	Oliver	123	“ I ’ll run all the way , sir . ”
48585	48595	48597	48599	the old gentleman	597	“ You _ shall _ go , my dear , ”

50033	50068	50070	50070	Sikes	183	“ ’Cause the government , as cares for the lives of such men as you , as have n’t half the pluck of curs , lets a man kill a dog how he likes , ”
50082	50087	50070	50070	Sikes	183	“ that ’s why . ”

53128	53179	53180	53181	The girl	1840	“ Unless you could pitch over a file and twenty yards of good stout rope , you might as well be walking fifty mile off , or not walking at all , for all the good it would do me . Come on , and do n’t stand preaching there . ”
53363	53367	53369	53369	Sikes	149	“ All right , ”

54425	54454	54423	54423	Sikes	149	“ and not half enough , neither . You may keep the books , if you ’re fond of reading . If you ai n’t , sell ’em . ”

Oh , pray send them back ; send him back the books and money . Keep me here all my life long ; but pray , pray send them back . He ’ll think I stole them ; the old lady : all of them who were so kind to me : will think I stole them . Oh , do have mercy upon me , and send them back ! ”

54772	54846	54770	54770	Sikes	149	“ I know’d that , directly I see him coming through Clerkenwell , with the books under his arm . It ’s all right enough . They ’re soft - hearted psalm - singers , or they would n’t have taken him in at all ; and they ’ll ask no questions after him , fear they should be obliged to prosecute , and so get him lagged . He ’s safe enough . ”

55270	55284	55286	55287	the Jew	1184	“ So you wanted to get away , my dear , did you ? ”
55305	55308	55286	55287	the Jew	1184	“ eh ? ”
55326	55340	55342	55343	the Jew	1184	“ Wanted to get assistance ; called for the police ; did you ? ”
55352	55364	55342	55343	the Jew	1184	“ We ’ll cure you of that , my young master . ”
55423	55436	55438	55439	the girl	1840	“ I wo n’t stand by and see it done , Fagin , ”
55441	55483	55438	55439	the girl	1840	“ You ’ve got the boy , and what more would you have?—Let him be — let him be — or I shall put that mark on some of you , that will bring me to the gallows before my time . ”
55537	55542	55544	55545	the Jew	1184	“ Why , Nancy ! ”
55572	55592	55558	55558	he	1184	“ you,—you’re more clever than ever tonight . Ha ! ha ! my dear , you are acting beautifully . ”
55593	55597	55599	55600	the girl	1840	“ Am I ? ”
55602	55639	55599	55600	the girl	1840	“ Take care I do n’t overdo it . You will be the worse for it , Fagin , if I do ; and so I tell you in good time to keep clear of me . ”
55812	55820	55822	55822	Sikes	149	“ What do you mean by this ? ”
55872	55896	55974	55975	The girl	1840	“ what do you mean by it ? Burn my body ! Do you know who you are , and what you are ? ”
55897	55908	55910	55911	the girl	1840	“ Oh , yes , I know all about it , ”
55932	55940	55942	55942	Sikes	149	“ Well , then , keep quiet , ”
55959	55973	55974	55975	The girl	1840	“ or I ’ll quiet you for a good long time to come . ”
56008	56015	56017	56017	Sikes	149	“ You ’re a nice one , ”
56028	56058	56020	56020	he	149	“ to take up the humane and gen — teel side ! A pretty subject for the child , as you call him , to make a friend of ! ”
56059	56068	56070	56071	the girl	1840	“ God Almighty help me , I am ! ”
56074	56143	56070	56071	the girl	1840	“ and I wish I had been struck dead in the street , or had changed places with them we passed so near tonight , before I had lent a hand in bringing him here . He ’s a thief , a liar , a devil , all that ’s bad , from this night forth . Is n’t that enough for the old wretch , without blows ? ”
56144	56151	56153	56154	the Jew	1184	“ Come , come , Sikes , ”
56178	56190	56166	56167	the boys	491	“ we must have civil words ; civil words , Bill . ”
56191	56195	56197	56198	the girl	1840	“ Civil words ! ”
56207	56238	56197	56198	the girl	1840	“ Civil words , you villain ! Yes , you deserve ’em from me . I thieved for you when I was a child not half as old as this ! ”
56243	56278	56197	56198	the girl	1840	“ I have been in the same trade , and in the same service , for twelve years since . Do n’t you know it ? Speak out ! Do n’t you know it ? ”
56279	56284	56286	56287	the Jew	1184	“ Well , well , ”
56295	56307	56286	56287	the Jew	1184	“ and , if you have , it ’s your living ! ”
56308	56314	56316	56317	the girl	1840	“ Aye , it is ! ”
56334	56384	56316	56317	the girl	1840	“ It is my living ; and the cold , wet , dirty streets are my home ; and you ’re the wretch that drove me to them long ago , and that ’ll keep me there , day and night , day and night , till I die ! ”
56385	56393	56395	56401	the Jew , goaded by these reproaches	2038	“ I shall do you a mischief ! ”
56403	56416	56395	56401	the Jew , goaded by these reproaches	2038	“ a mischief worse than that , if you say much more ! ”
56482	56489	56491	56491	Sikes	149	“ She ’s all right now , ”
56500	56517	56491	56491	Sikes	149	“ She ’s uncommon strong in the arms , when she ’s up in this way . ”
56570	56582	56584	56585	the Jew	1184	“ It ’s the worst of having to do with women , ”
56591	56618	56584	56585	the Jew	1184	“ but they ’re clever , and we ca n’t get on , in our line , without ’em . Charley , show Oliver to bed . ”
56619	56637	56639	56640	Charley Bates	164	“ I suppose he ’d better not wear his best clothes tomorrow , Fagin , had he ? ”
56642	56646	56648	56649	the Jew	1184	“ Certainly not , ”
56762	56769	56771	56771	Charley	164	“ Put off the smart ones , ”
56773	56791	56771	56771	Charley	164	“ and I ’ll give ’em to Fagin to take care of . What fun it is ! ”
57537	57542	57544	57545	Mrs. Mann	127	“ Drat that beadle ! ”
57559	57608	57544	57545	Mrs. Mann	127	“ If it is n’t him at this time in the morning ! Lauk , Mr. Bumble , only think of its being you ! Well , dear me , it _ is _ a pleasure , this is ! Come into the parlour , sir , please . ”
57652	57656	57658	57659	Mr. Bumble	128	“ Mrs. Mann , ”
57689	57698	57680	57680	himself	128	“ Mrs. Mann , ma’am , good morning . ”
57699	57712	57714	57715	Mrs. Mann	127	“ Well , and good morning to _ you _ , sir , ”
57721	57731	57714	57715	Mrs. Mann	127	“ and hoping you find yourself well , sir ! ”
57732	57740	57742	57743	the beadle	389	“ So - so , Mrs. Mann , ”
57745	57759	57742	57743	the beadle	389	“ A porochial life is not a bed of roses , Mrs. Mann . ”
57760	57772	57774	57775	the lady	711	“ Ah , that it is n’t indeed , Mr. Bumble , ”
57797	57804	57806	57807	Mr. Bumble	128	“ A porochial life , ma’am , ”
57816	57843	57813	57813	his	128	“ is a life of worrit , and vexation , and hardihood ; but all public characters , as I may say , must suffer prosecution . ”
57868	57879	57881	57882	the beadle	389	“ Ah ! You may well sigh , Mrs. Mann ! ”
57920	57930	57890	57891	Mrs. Mann	127	“ Mrs. Mann , I am going to London . ”
57931	57937	57939	57940	Mrs. Mann	127	“ Lauk , Mr. Bumble ! ”
57945	57951	57953	57955	the inflexible beadle	2090	“ To London , ma’am , ”
57957	58012	58014	58015	Mr. Bumble	128	“ by coach . I and two paupers , Mrs. Mann ! A legal action is a coming on , about a settlement ; and the board has appointed me — me , Mrs. Mann — to dispose to the matter before the quarter - sessions at Clerkinwell . And I very much question , ”
58021	58041	58014	58015	Mr. Bumble	128	“ whether the Clerkinwell Sessions will not find themselves in the wrong box before they have done with me . ”
58042	58056	58058	58059	Mrs. Mann	127	“ Oh ! you must n’t be too hard upon them , sir , ”
58063	58075	58077	58078	Mr. Bumble	128	“ The Clerkinwell Sessions have brought it upon themselves , ma’am , ”
58080	58106	58077	58078	Mr. Bumble	128	“ and if the Clerkinwell Sessions find that they come off rather worse than they expected , the Clerkinwell Sessions have only themselves to thank . ”
58144	58166	58141	58141	she	127	“ You ’re going by coach , sir ? I thought it was always usual to send them paupers in carts . ”
58167	58178	58180	58181	the beadle	389	“ That ’s when they ’re ill , Mrs. Mann , ”
58183	58203	58180	58181	the beadle	389	“ We put the sick paupers into open carts in the rainy weather , to prevent their taking cold . ”
58204	58207	58209	58210	Mrs. Mann	127	“ Oh ! ”
58212	58226	58228	58229	Mr. Bumble	128	“ The opposition coach contracts for these two ; and takes them cheap , ”
58231	58298	58228	58229	Mr. Bumble	128	“ They are both in a very low state , and we find it would come two pound cheaper to move ’em than to bury ’em — that is , if we can throw ’em upon another parish , which I think we shall be able to do , if they do n’t die upon the road to spite us . Ha ! ha ! ha ! ”
58321	58329	58331	58332	the beadle	389	“ We are forgetting business , ma’am , ”
58334	58344	58331	58332	the beadle	389	“ here is your porochial stipend for the month . ”
58372	58381	58383	58386	the farmer of infants	2093	“ It ’s very much blotted , sir , ”
58388	58419	58383	58386	the farmer of infants	2093	“ but it ’s formal enough , I dare say . Thank you , Mr. Bumble , sir , I am very much obliged to you , I ’m sure . ”
58441	58448	58450	58451	Mrs. Mann	127	“ Bless their dear little hearts ! ”
58455	58482	58450	58451	Mrs. Mann	127	“ they ’re as well as can be , the dears ! Of course , except the two that died last week . And little Dick . ”
58483	58491	58493	58494	Mr. Bumble	128	“ Is n’t that boy no better ? ”
58502	58519	58521	58522	Mr. Bumble	128	“ He ’s a ill - conditioned , wicious , bad - disposed porochial child that , ”
58525	58530	58521	58522	Mr. Bumble	128	“ Where is he ? ”
58531	58544	58546	58547	Mrs. Mann	127	“ I ’ll bring him to you in one minute , sir , ”
58549	58555	58546	58547	Mrs. Mann	127	“ Here , you Dick ! ”
58681	58694	58696	58697	Mrs. Mann	127	“ Ca n’t you look at the gentleman , you obstinate boy ? ”
58713	58724	58726	58727	Mr. Bumble	128	“ What ’s the matter with you , porochial Dick ? ”
58735	58740	58742	58743	the child	306	“ Nothing , sir , ”
58746	58752	58754	58755	Mrs. Mann	127	“ I should think not , ”
58770	58780	58754	58755	Mrs. Mann	127	“ You want for nothing , I ’m sure . ”
58781	58786	58788	58789	the child	306	“ I should like — ”
58791	58796	58798	58799	Mrs. Mann	127	“ Hey - day ! ”
58801	58826	58798	58799	Mrs. Mann	127	“ I suppose you ’re going to say that you _ do _ want for something , now ? Why , you little wretch — ”
58827	58835	58837	58838	the beadle	389	“ Stop , Mrs. Mann , stop ! ”
58849	58857	58841	58841	his	389	“ Like what , sir , eh ? ”
58858	58863	58865	58866	the child	306	“ I should like , ”
58868	58911	58865	58866	the child	306	“ if somebody that can write , would put a few words down for me on a piece of paper , and fold it up and seal it , and keep it for me , after I am laid in the ground . ”
58912	58921	58923	58924	Mr. Bumble	128	“ Why , what does the boy mean ? ”
58950	58958	58865	58866	the child	306	“ What do you mean , sir ? ”
58959	58964	58966	58967	the child	306	“ I should like , ”
58969	59018	59020	59021	the child	306	“ to leave my dear love to poor Oliver Twist ; and to let him know how often I have sat by myself and cried to think of his wandering about in the dark nights with nobody to help him . And I should like to tell him , ”
59034	59097	59020	59021	the child	306	“ that I was glad to die when I was very young ; for , perhaps , if I had lived to be a man , and had grown old , my little sister who is in Heaven , might forget me , or be unlike me ; and it would be so much happier if we were both children there together . ”
59123	59144	59118	59118	his	128	“ They ’re all in one story , Mrs. Mann . That out - dacious Oliver had demogalized them all ! ”
59145	59154	59156	59157	Mrs Mann	127	“ I could n’t have believed it , sir ”
59170	59180	59156	59157	Mrs Mann	127	“ I never see such a hardened little wretch ! ”
59181	59188	59190	59191	Mr. Bumble	128	“ Take him away , ma’am ! ”
59194	59206	59190	59191	Mr. Bumble	128	“ This must be stated to the board , Mrs. Mann . ”
59207	59223	59225	59226	Mrs. Mann	127	“ I hope the gentleman will understand that it is n’t my fault , sir ? ”
59231	59251	59253	59254	Mr. Bumble	128	“ They shall understand that , ma’am ; they shall be acquainted with the true state of the case , ”
59256	59272	59253	59254	Mr. Bumble	128	“ There ; take him away , I ca n’t bear the sight on him . ”
59542	59546	59553	59554	Oliver Twist	123	“ FIVE GUINEAS REWARD “
59632	59715	59621	59622	the advertiser	2118	” And then followed a full description of Oliver ’s dress , person , appearance , and disappearance : with the name and address of Mr. Brownlow at full length . Mr. Bumble opened his eyes ; read the advertisement , slowly and carefully , three several times ; and in something more than five minutes was on his way to Pentonville : having actually , in his excitement , left the glass of hot gin - and - water , untasted . “
59722	59749	59717	59718	Mr. Brownlow	173	” inquired Mr. Bumble of the girl who opened the door . To this inquiry the girl returned the not uncommon , but rather evasive reply of “
59761	59799	59757	59757	you	173	” Mr. Bumble no sooner uttered Oliver ’s name , in explanation of his errand , than Mrs. Bedwin , who had been listening at the parlour door , hastened into the passage in a breathless state . “
59806	59812	59813	59813	I	0	” said the old lady : “
59845	59941	59839	59839	I	0	” Having said this , the worthy old lady hurried back into the parlour again ; and seating herself on a sofa , burst into tears . The girl , who was not quite so susceptible , had run upstairs meanwhile ; and now returned with a request that Mr. Bumble would follow her immediately : which he did . He was shown into the little back study , where sat Mr. Brownlow and his friend Mr. Grimwig , with decanters and glasses before them . The latter gentleman at once burst into the exclamation : “
59956	59957	59950	59950	I	0	” “
59965	59970	59950	59950	I	0	” said Mr. Brownlow . “
59978	60023	59976	59976	you	2123	” Mr. Bumble sat himself down ; quite confounded by the oddity of Mr. Grimwig ’s manner . Mr. Brownlow moved the lamp , so as to obtain an uninterrupted view of the beadle ’s countenance ; and said , with a little impatience , “
60038	60039	60042	60042	sir	4543	” “
60044	60049	60042	60042	sir	4543	” said Mr. Bumble . “
60062	60067	60059	60059	you	4543	” inquired Mr. Grimwig . “
60076	60082	60074	60074	gentlemen	5185	” rejoined Mr. Bumble proudly . “
60086	60095	60098	60098	he	2129	” observed Mr. Grimwig aside to his friend , “
60106	60123	60101	60102	A beadle	431	” Mr. Brownlow gently shook his head to impose silence on his friend , and resumed : “
60134	60135	60125	60125	you	4543	” “
60141	60146	60139	60139	nobody	316	” replied Mr. Bumble . “
60158	60164	60153	60153	you	4543	” inquired the old gentleman . “
60187	60188	60182	60182	you	4543	” “
60203	60237	60238	60238	You	4543	” said Mr. Grimwig , caustically ; after an attentive perusal of Mr. Bumble ’s features . Mr. Bumble , catching at the inquiry very quickly , shook his head with portentous solemnity . “
60241	60465	60238	60238	You	4543	” said Mr. Grimwig , looking triumphantly at Mr. Brownlow . Mr. Brownlow looked apprehensively at Mr. Bumble ’s pursed - up countenance ; and requested him to communicate what he knew regarding Oliver , in as few words as possible . Mr. Bumble put down his hat ; unbuttoned his coat ; folded his arms ; inclined his head in a retrospective manner ; and , after a few moments ’ reflection , commenced his story . It would be tedious if given in the beadle ’s words : occupying , as it did , some twenty minutes in the telling ; but the sum and substance of it was , that Oliver was a foundling , born of low and vicious parents . That he had , from his birth , displayed no better qualities than treachery , ingratitude , and malice . That he had terminated his brief career in the place of his birth , by making a sanguinary and cowardly attack on an unoffending lad , and running away in the night - time from his master ’s house . In proof of his really being the person he represented himself , Mr. Bumble laid upon the table the papers he had brought to town . Folding his arms again , he then awaited Mr. Brownlow ’s observations . “
60474	60487	60466	60466	I	0	” said the old gentleman sorrowfully , after looking over the papers . “
60516	60622	60623	60624	Mrs. Bedwin	178	” It is not improbable that if Mr. Bumble had been possessed of this information at an earlier period of the interview , he might have imparted a very different colouring to his little history . It was too late to do it now , however ; so he shook his head gravely , and , pocketing the five guineas , withdrew . Mr. Brownlow paced the room to and fro for some minutes ; evidently so much disturbed by the beadle ’s tale , that even Mr. Grimwig forbore to vex him further . At length he stopped , and rang the bell violently . “
60626	60636	60623	60624	Mrs. Bedwin	178	” said Mr. Brownlow , when the housekeeper appeared ; “
60646	60647	60643	60644	an imposter	2137	” “
60660	60667	60671	60671	he	4614	” said the old lady energetically . “
60674	60680	60668	60668	I	0	” retorted the old gentleman . “
60718	60719	60704	60704	he	4614	” “
60728	60736	60720	60720	I	0	” replied the old lady , firmly . “
60739	60740	60741	60741	You	178	” “
60758	60763	60764	60764	I	0	” growled Mr. Grimwig . “
60808	60819	60820	60820	He	4614	” And Mr. Grimwig poked the fire with a flourish . “
60832	60839	60830	60830	sir	4543	” retorted Mrs. Bedwin , indignantly . “
60876	60927	60873	60873	my	0	” This was a hard hit at Mr. Grimwig , who was a bachelor . As it extorted nothing from that gentleman but a smile , the old lady tossed her head , and smoothed down her apron preparatory to another speech , when she was stopped by Mr. Brownlow . “
60930	60945	60873	60873	my	0	” said the old gentleman , feigning an anger he was far from feeling . “
60989	62266	60984	60984	I	0	” There were sad hearts at Mr. Brownlow ’s that night . Oliver ’s heart sank within him , when he thought of his good friends ; it was well for him that he could not know what they had heard , or it might have broken outright . CHAPTER XVIII . HOW OLIVER PASSED HIS TIME IN THE IMPROVING SOCIETY OF HIS REPUTABLE FRIENDS About noon next day , when the Dodger and Master Bates had gone out to pursue their customary avocations , Mr. Fagin took the opportunity of reading Oliver a long lecture on the crying sin of ingratitude ; of which he clearly demonstrated he had been guilty , to no ordinary extent , in wilfully absenting himself from the society of his anxious friends ; and , still more , in endeavouring to escape from them after so much trouble and expense had been incurred in his recovery . Mr. Fagin laid great stress on the fact of his having taken Oliver in , and cherished him , when , without his timely aid , he might have perished with hunger ; and he related the dismal and affecting history of a young lad whom , in his philanthropy , he had succoured under parallel circumstances , but who , proving unworthy of his confidence and evincing a desire to communicate with the police , had unfortunately come to be hanged at the Old Bailey one morning . Mr. Fagin did not seek to conceal his share in the catastrophe , but lamented with tears in his eyes that the wrong - headed and treacherous behaviour of the young person in question , had rendered it necessary that he should become the victim of certain evidence for the crown : which , if it were not precisely true , was indispensably necessary for the safety of him ( Mr. Fagin ) and a few select friends . Mr. Fagin concluded by drawing a rather disagreeable picture of the discomforts of hanging ; and , with great friendliness and politeness of manner , expressed his anxious hopes that he might never be obliged to submit Oliver Twist to that unpleasant operation . Little Oliver ’s blood ran cold , as he listened to the Jew ’s words , and imperfectly comprehended the dark threats conveyed in them . That it was possible even for justice itself to confound the innocent with the guilty when they were in accidental companionship , he knew already ; and that deeply - laid plans for the destruction of inconveniently knowing or over - communicative persons , had been really devised and carried out by the Jew on more occasions than one , he thought by no means unlikely , when he recollected the general nature of the altercations between that gentleman and Mr. Sikes : which seemed to bear reference to some foregone conspiracy of the kind . As he glanced timidly up , and met the Jew ’s searching look , he felt that his pale face and trembling limbs were neither unnoticed nor unrelished by that wary old gentleman . The Jew , smiling hideously , patted Oliver on the head , and said , that if he kept himself quiet , and applied himself to business , he saw they would be very good friends yet . Then , taking his hat , and covering himself with an old patched great - coat , he went out , and locked the room - door behind him . And so Oliver remained all that day , and for the greater part of many subsequent days , seeing nobody , between early morning and midnight , and left during the long hours to commune with his own thoughts . Which , never failing to revert to his kind friends , and the opinion they must long ago have formed of him , were sad indeed . After the lapse of a week or so , the Jew left the room - door unlocked ; and he was at liberty to wander about the house . It was a very dirty place . The rooms upstairs had great high wooden chimney - pieces and large doors , with panelled walls and cornices to the ceiling ; which , although they were black with neglect and dust , were ornamented in various ways . From all of these tokens Oliver concluded that a long time ago , before the old Jew was born , it had belonged to better people , and had perhaps been quite gay and handsome : dismal and dreary as it looked now . Spiders had built their webs in the angles of the walls and ceilings ; and sometimes , when Oliver walked softly into a room , the mice would scamper across the floor , and run back terrified to their holes . With these exceptions , there was neither sight nor sound of any living thing ; and often , when it grew dark , and he was tired of wandering from room to room , he would crouch in the corner of the passage by the street - door , to be as near living people as he could ; and would remain there , listening and counting the hours , until the Jew or the boys returned . In all the rooms , the mouldering shutters were fast closed : the bars which held them were screwed tight into the wood ; the only light which was admitted , stealing its way through round holes at the top : which made the rooms more gloomy , and filled them with strange shadows . There was a back - garret window with rusty bars outside , which had no shutter ; and out of this , Oliver often gazed with a melancholy face for hours together ; but nothing was to be descried from it but a confused and crowded mass of housetops , blackened chimneys , and gable - ends . Sometimes , indeed , a grizzly head might be seen , peering over the parapet - wall of a distant house ; but it was quickly withdrawn again ; and as the window of Oliver ’s observatory was nailed down , and dimmed with the rain and smoke of years , it was as much as he could do to make out the forms of the different objects beyond , without making any attempt to be seen or heard,—which he had as much chance of being , as if he had lived inside the ball of St. Paul ’s Cathedral . One afternoon , the Dodger and Master Bates being engaged out that evening , the first - named young gentleman took it into his head to evince some anxiety regarding the decoration of his person ( to do him justice , this was by no means an habitual weakness with him ) ; and , with this end and aim , he condescendingly commanded Oliver to assist him in his toilet , straightway . Oliver was but too glad to make himself useful ; too happy to have some faces , however bad , to look upon ; too desirous to conciliate those about him when he could honestly do so ; to throw any objection in the way of this proposal . So he at once expressed his readiness ; and , kneeling on the floor , while the Dodger sat upon the table so that he could take his foot in his laps , he applied himself to a process which Mr. Dawkins designated as “
62273	62454	60984	60984	I	0	” The phrase , rendered into plain English , signifieth , cleaning his boots . Whether it was the sense of freedom and independence which a rational animal may be supposed to feel when he sits on a table in an easy attitude smoking a pipe , swinging one leg carelessly to and fro , and having his boots cleaned all the time , without even the past trouble of having taken them off , or the prospective misery of putting them on , to disturb his reflections ; or whether it was the goodness of the tobacco that soothed the feelings of the Dodger , or the mildness of the beer that mollified his thoughts ; he was evidently tinctured , for the nonce , with a spice of romance and enthusiasm , foreign to his general nature . He looked down on Oliver , with a thoughtful countenance , for a brief space ; and then , raising his head , and heaving a gentle sigh , said , half in abstraction , and half to Master Bates : “
62466	62467	62463	62464	a prig	2151	” “
62470	62476	60984	60984	I	0	” said Master Charles Bates ; “
62487	62514	62477	62477	he	2150	” The Dodger sighed again , and resumed his pipe : as did Charley Bates . They both smoked , for some seconds , in silence . “
62527	62533	62517	62517	you	0	” said the Dodger mournfully . “
62540	62547	62534	62534	I	0	” replied Oliver , looking up . “
62562	62569	62570	62570	I	0	” inquired Oliver , checking himself . “
62573	62578	62570	62570	I	0	” replied the Dodger . “
62587	62625	62626	62626	I	0	” Mr. Dawkins gave his hat a ferocious cock , after delivering this sentiment , and looked at Master Bates , as if to denote that he would feel obliged by his saying anything to the contrary . “
62629	62634	62626	62626	I	0	” repeated the Dodger . “
62675	62676	62666	62666	he	2156	” “
62684	62689	62690	62690	He	2156	” added Charley Bates . “
62730	62735	62713	62713	you	2159	” said the Dodger . “
62742	62746	62713	62713	you	2159	” observed Charley . “
62772	62777	62755	62755	he	2156	” pursued the Dodger . “
62810	62811	62812	62812	He	2156	” “
62822	62895	62812	62812	He	2156	” said Charley . This was merely intended as a tribute to the animal ’s abilities , but it was an appropriate remark in another sense , if Master Bates had only known it ; for there are a good many ladies and gentlemen , claiming to be out - and - out Christians , between whom , and Mr. Sikes ’ dog , there exist strong and singular points of resemblance . “
62900	62927	62812	62812	He	2156	” said the Dodger , recurring to the point from which they had strayed : with that mindfulness of his profession which influenced all his proceedings . “
62940	62941	62936	62937	young Green	198	” “
62947	62951	62936	62937	young Green	198	” said Charley . “
62963	62964	62959	62959	Fagin	161	” “
62974	62983	62959	62959	Fagin	161	” added the Dodger , with a grin . “
63030	63035	63036	63036	I	0	” said Charley Bates . “
63042	63048	63036	63036	I	0	” rejoined Oliver , timidly ; “
63065	63066	63057	63057	I	0	” “
63075	63111	63068	63068	Fagin	161	” rejoined Charley . Oliver knew this too well ; but thinking it might be dangerous to express his feelings more openly , he only sighed , and went on with his boot - cleaning . “
63114	63119	63068	63068	Fagin	161	” exclaimed the Dodger . “
63147	63148	63068	63068	Fagin	161	” “
63154	63176	63068	63068	Fagin	161	” said Master Bates : drawing two or three silk handkerchiefs from his pocket , and tossing them into a cupboard , “
63185	63186	63188	63188	I	0	” “
63195	63207	63188	63188	I	0	” said the Dodger , with an air of haughty disgust . “
63216	63224	63188	63188	I	0	” said Oliver with a half smile ; “
63235	63236	63188	63188	I	0	” “
63239	63251	63188	63188	I	0	” rejoined the Dodger , with a wave of his pipe , “
63296	63360	63294	63294	Charley	164	” Master Bates nodded assent , and would have spoken , but the recollection of Oliver ’s flight came so suddenly upon him , that the smoke he was inhaling got entangled with a laugh , and went up into his head , and down into his throat : and brought on a fit of coughing and stamping , about five minutes long . “
63364	63378	63294	63294	Charley	164	” said the Dodger , drawing forth a handful of shillings and halfpence . “
63423	63424	63419	63419	you	2164	” “
63435	63440	63433	63433	Oliver	123	” inquired Charley Bates . “
63452	63453	63450	63450	he	161	” “
63462	63466	63454	63454	I	0	” replied Oliver . “
63475	63539	63472	63473	old feller	2172	” said Charley . As he said it , Master Bates caught up an end of his neckerchief ; and , holding it erect in the air , dropped his head on his shoulder , and jerked a curious sound through his teeth ; thereby indicating , by a lively pantomimic representation , that scragging and hanging were one and the same thing . “
63546	63550	63472	63473	old feller	2172	” said Charley . “
63584	63603	63581	63581	he	161	” Master Charley Bates , having laughed heartily again , resumed his pipe with tears in his eyes . “
63611	63628	63604	63604	You	2174	” said the Dodger , surveying his boots with much satisfaction when Oliver had polished them . “
63682	63762	63680	63680	Oliver	123	” Master Bates backed this advice with sundry moral admonitions of his own : which , being exhausted , he and his friend Mr. Dawkins launched into a glowing description of the numerous pleasures incidental to the life they led , interspersed with a variety of hints to Oliver that the best thing he could do , would be to secure Fagin ’s favour without more delay , by the means which they themselves had employed to gain it . “
63773	63788	63768	63768	your	2174	” said the Dodger , as the Jew was heard unlocking the door above , “
63798	63799	63790	63790	you	2174	” “
63810	63815	63816	63816	he	123	” interposed Master Bates ; “
63824	63825	63816	63816	he	123	” “
63837	63853	63854	63856	some other cove	2175	” said the Dodger , reducing his conversation to the level of Oliver ’s capacity , “
63911	63912	63883	63888	nobody half a ha’p’orth the better	2177	” “
63921	63933	63883	63888	nobody half a ha’p’orth the better	2177	” said the Jew , who had entered unseen by Oliver . “
63969	64168	63961	63961	He	1138	” The old man rubbed his hands gleefully together , as he corroborated the Dodger ’s reasoning in these terms ; and chuckled with delight at his pupil ’s proficiency . The conversation proceeded no farther at this time , for the Jew had returned home accompanied by Miss Betsy , and a gentleman whom Oliver had never seen before , but who was accosted by the Dodger as Tom Chitling ; and who , having lingered on the stairs to exchange a few gallantries with the lady , now made his appearance . Mr. Chitling was older in years than the Dodger : having perhaps numbered eighteen winters ; but there was a degree of deference in his deportment towards that young gentleman which seemed to indicate that he felt himself conscious of a slight inferiority in point of genius and professional aquirements . He had small twinkling eyes , and a pock - marked face ; wore a fur cap , a dark corduroy jacket , greasy fustian trousers , and an apron . His wardrobe was , in truth , rather out of repair ; but he excused himself to the company by stating that his “
64170	64301	64303	64303	he	2181	” was only out an hour before ; and that , in consequence of having worn the regimentals for six weeks past , he had not been able to bestow any attention on his private clothes . Mr. Chitling added , with strong marks of irritation , that the new way of fumigating clothes up yonder was infernal unconstitutional , for it burnt holes in them , and there was no remedy against the county . The same remark he considered to apply to the regulation mode of cutting the hair : which he held to be decidedly unlawful . Mr. Chitling wound up his observations by stating that he had not touched a drop of anything for forty - two moral long hard - working days ; and that he “
64318	64319	64308	64308	he	2181	” “
64332	64354	64355	64355	I	0	” inquired the Jew , with a grin , as the other boys put a bottle of spirits on the table . “
64364	64368	64357	64357	I	0	” replied Oliver . “
64373	64385	64386	64390	A young friend of mine	2185	” inquired Tom Chitling , casting a contemptuous look at Oliver . “
64395	64400	64386	64390	A young friend of mine	2185	” replied the Jew . “
64408	64421	64401	64401	He	2185	” said the young man , with a meaning look at Fagin . “
64449	65189	65191	65191	me	0	” At this sally , the boys laughed . After some more jokes on the same subject , they exchanged a few short whispers with Fagin ; and withdrew . After some words apart between the last comer and Fagin , they drew their chairs towards the fire ; and the Jew , telling Oliver to come and sit by him , led the conversation to the topics most calculated to interest his hearers . These were , the great advantages of the trade , the proficiency of the Dodger , the amiability of Charley Bates , and the liberality of the Jew himself . At length these subjects displayed signs of being thoroughly exhausted ; and Mr. Chitling did the same : for the house of correction becomes fatiguing after a week or two . Miss Betsy accordingly withdrew ; and left the party to their repose . From this day , Oliver was seldom left alone ; but was placed in almost constant communication with the two boys , who played the old game with the Jew every day : whether for their own improvement or Oliver ’s , Mr. Fagin best knew . At other times the old man would tell them stories of robberies he had committed in his younger days : mixed up with so much that was droll and curious , that Oliver could not help laughing heartily , and showing that he was amused in spite of all his better feelings . In short , the wily old Jew had the boy in his toils . Having prepared his mind , by solitude and gloom , to prefer any society to the companionship of his own sad thoughts in such a dreary place , he was now slowly instilling into his soul the poison which he hoped would blacken it , and change its hue for ever . CHAPTER XIX . IN WHICH A NOTABLE PLAN IS DISCUSSED AND DETERMINED ON It was a chill , damp , windy night , when the Jew : buttoning his great - coat tight round his shrivelled body , and pulling the collar up over his ears so as completely to obscure the lower part of his face : emerged from his den . He paused on the step as the door was locked and chained behind him ; and having listened while the boys made all secure , and until their retreating footsteps were no longer audible , slunk down the street as quickly as he could . The house to which Oliver had been conveyed , was in the neighborhood of Whitechapel . The Jew stopped for an instant at the corner of the street ; and , glancing suspiciously round , crossed the road , and struck off in the direction of the Spitalfields . The mud lay thick upon the stones , and a black mist hung over the streets ; the rain fell sluggishly down , and everything felt cold and clammy to the touch . It seemed just the night when it befitted such a being as the Jew to be abroad . As he glided stealthily along , creeping beneath the shelter of the walls and doorways , the hideous old man seemed like some loathsome reptile , engendered in the slime and darkness through which he moved : crawling forth , by night , in search of some rich offal for a meal . He kept on his course , through many winding and narrow ways , until he reached Bethnal Green ; then , turning suddenly off to the left , he soon became involved in a maze of the mean and dirty streets which abound in that close and densely - populated quarter . The Jew was evidently too familiar with the ground he traversed to be at all bewildered , either by the darkness of the night , or the intricacies of the way . He hurried through several alleys and streets , and at length turned into one , lighted only by a single lamp at the farther end . At the door of a house in this street , he knocked ; having exchanged a few muttered words with the person who opened it , he walked upstairs . A dog growled as he touched the handle of a room - door ; and a man ’s voice demanded who was there . “
65201	65208	65193	65193	Bill	149	” said the Jew looking in . “
65215	65219	65193	65193	Bill	149	” said Sikes . “
65243	65311	65231	65232	the devil	2190	” Apparently , the dog had been somewhat deceived by Mr. Fagin ’s outer garment ; for as the Jew unbuttoned it , and threw it over the back of a chair , he retired to the corner from which he had risen : wagging his tail as he went , to show that he was as well satisfied as it was in his nature to be . “
65314	65318	65231	65232	the devil	2190	” said Sikes . “
65324	65327	65329	65329	Nancy	167	” replied the Jew.—“Ah
65331	65428	65329	65329	Nancy	167	” The latter recognition was uttered with just enough of embarrassment to imply a doubt of its reception ; for Mr. Fagin and his young friend had not met , since she had interfered in behalf of Oliver . All doubts upon the subject , if he had any , were speedily removed by the young lady ’s behaviour . She took her feet off the fender , pushed back her chair , and bade Fagin draw up his , without saying more about it : for it was a cold night , and no mistake . “
65438	65453	65435	65435	Nancy	167	” said the Jew , as he warmed his skinny hands over the fire . “
65462	65472	65435	65435	Nancy	167	” added the old man , touching his side . “
65488	65493	65500	65500	Nancy	167	” said Mr. Sikes . “
65539	65589	65597	65597	Bill	149	” Nancy quickly brought a bottle from a cupboard , in which there were many : which , to judge from the diversity of their appearance , were filled with several kinds of liquids . Sikes pouring out a glass of brandy , bade the Jew drink it off . “
65599	65616	65597	65597	Bill	149	” replied the Jew , putting down the glass after just setting his lips to it . “
65633	65644	65631	65631	you	167	” inquired Sikes , fixing his eyes on the Jew . “
65647	65780	65631	65631	you	167	” With a hoarse grunt of contempt , Mr. Sikes seized the glass , and threw the remainder of its contents into the ashes : as a preparatory ceremony to filling it again for himself : which he did at once . The Jew glanced round the room , as his companion tossed down the second glassful ; not in curiousity , for he had seen it often before ; but in a restless and suspicious manner habitual to him . It was a meanly furnished apartment , with nothing but the contents of the closet to induce the belief that its occupier was anything but a working man ; and with no more suspicious articles displayed to view than two or three heavy bludgeons which stood in a corner , and a “
65784	65793	65883	65883	I	0	” that hung over the chimney - piece . “
65796	65804	65883	65883	I	0	” said Sikes , smacking his lips . “
65810	65811	65806	65806	I	0	” “
65815	65820	65806	65806	I	0	” inquired the Jew . “
65824	65828	65806	65806	I	0	” replied Sikes ; “
65838	65839	65832	65832	you	0	” “
65848	65866	65846	65846	Bill	149	” said the Jew , drawing his chair forward , and speaking in a very low voice . “
65873	65877	65905	65905	he	149	” inquired Sikes . “
65889	65894	65883	65883	I	0	” said the Jew . “
65907	65908	65905	65905	he	149	” “
65915	65920	65911	65911	he	149	” sneered Mr. Sikes . “
65977	65978	65981	65981	Bill	149	” “
65985	66002	65981	65981	Bill	149	” said the Jew , who had in vain attempted to stop this burst of indignation ; “
66016	66017	66011	66011	Somebody	5093	” “
66022	66026	66027	66027	I	0	” said Sikes ; “
66032	66059	66027	66027	I	0	” But as Mr. Sikes _ did _ care , on reflection , he dropped his voice as he said the words , and grew calmer . “
66064	66071	66027	66027	I	0	” said the Jew , coaxingly . “
66119	66138	66027	66027	I	0	” said the Jew : rubbing his hands , and elevating his eyebrows in a rapture of anticipation . “
66143	66148	66027	66027	I	0	” replied Sikes coldly . “
66156	66167	66027	66027	I	0	” echoed the Jew , leaning back in his chair . “
66174	66178	66027	66027	I	0	” rejoined Sikes . “
66195	66196	66027	66027	I	0	” “
66206	66216	66027	66027	I	0	” said the Jew , turning pale with anger . “
66222	66223	66220	66220	me	0	” “
66230	66234	66225	66225	I	0	” retorted Sikes . “
66273	66274	66262	66262	he	201	” “
66284	66296	66276	66276	you	0	” said the Jew : softening as the other grew heated : “
66311	66312	66315	66315	I	0	” “
66323	66327	66315	66315	I	0	” replied Sikes . “
66356	66357	66360	66360	you	0	” “
66368	66373	66360	66360	you	0	” remonstrated the Jew , “
66383	66384	66375	66376	the women	2215	” “
66391	66395	66375	66376	the women	2215	” replied Sikes . “
66402	66408	66398	66400	flash Toby Crackit	201	” said the Jew incredulously . “
66416	66417	66414	66414	Bill	149	” “
66427	66431	66432	66432	He	201	” replied Sikes . “
66464	66465	66466	66466	He	201	” “
66481	66486	66488	66488	he	201	” said the Jew . “
66491	66495	66497	66497	they	2219	” rejoined Sikes , “
66508	66557	66497	66497	they	2219	” The Jew looked blank at this information . After ruminating for some minutes with his chin sunk on his breast , he raised his head and said , with a deep sigh , that if flash Toby Crackit reported aright , he feared the game was up . “
66561	66574	66497	66497	they	2219	” said the old man , dropping his hands on his knees , “
66597	66598	66497	66497	they	2219	” “
66603	66608	66497	66497	they	2219	” said Mr. Sikes . “
66612	66678	66679	66679	Fagin	161	” A long silence ensued ; during which the Jew was plunged in deep thought , with his face wrinkled into an expression of villainy perfectly demoniacal . Sikes eyed him furtively from time to time . Nancy , apparently fearful of irritating the housebreaker , sat with her eyes fixed upon the fire , as if she had been deaf to all that passed . “
66681	66692	66679	66679	Fagin	161	” said Sikes , abruptly breaking the stillness that prevailed ; “
66709	66710	66679	66679	Fagin	161	” “
66713	66723	66679	66679	Fagin	161	” said the Jew , as suddenly rousing himself . “
66729	66733	66679	66679	Fagin	161	” inquired Sikes . “
66741	66767	66679	66679	Fagin	161	” rejoined the Jew ; his eyes glistening , and every muscle in his face working , with the excitement that the inquiry had awakened . “
66770	66785	66679	66679	Fagin	161	” said Sikes , thrusting aside the Jew ’s hand , with some disdain , “
66843	66844	66849	66849	Bill	149	” “
66851	66857	66849	66849	Bill	149	” asked the Jew eagerly . “
66860	66864	66849	66849	Bill	149	” whispered Sikes , “
66871	66872	66866	66866	you	4649	” “
66875	66894	66866	66866	you	4649	” said the Jew , bending his head forward , with his eyes almost starting out of it . “
66897	66928	66866	66866	you	4649	” cried Sikes , stopping short , as the girl , scarcely moving her head , looked suddenly round , and pointed for an instant to the Jew ’s face . “
66963	66964	66966	66966	you	4649	” “
66975	66980	66973	66973	you	4649	” replied the Jew . “
66993	66994	66990	66990	Toby	201	” “
66997	67001	66990	66990	Toby	201	” said Sikes , “
67026	67027	67028	67029	A boy	4627	” “
67031	67036	67028	67029	A boy	4627	” exclaimed the Jew . “
67047	67048	67028	67029	A boy	4627	” “
67055	67059	67060	67060	I	0	” replied Sikes . “
67076	67083	67069	67074	a big ’ un . Lord	2232	” said Mr. Sikes , reflectively , “
67167	67182	67163	67163	they	2238	” said Mr. Sikes , his wrath rising with the recollection of his wrongs , “
67227	67228	67231	67231	we	2239	” “
67234	67255	67256	67256	Bill	149	” acquiesced the Jew , who had been considering during this speech , and had only caught the last sentence . “
67258	67259	67256	67256	Bill	149	” “
67263	67332	67256	67256	Bill	149	” inquired Sikes . The Jew nodded his head towards Nancy , who was still gazing at the fire ; and intimated , by a sign , that he would have her told to leave the room . Sikes shrugged his shoulders impatiently , as if he thought the precaution unnecessary ; but complied , nevertheless , by requesting Miss Nancy to fetch him a jug of beer . “
67340	67355	67333	67333	You	149	” said Nancy , folding her arms , and retaining her seat very composedly . “
67362	67366	67359	67359	I	0	” replied Sikes . “
67369	67375	67379	67379	Fagin	161	” rejoined the girl coolly , “
67398	67415	67392	67392	he	161	” The Jew still hesitated . Sikes looked from one to the other in some surprise . “
67431	67437	67427	67427	you	149	” he asked at length . “
67466	67467	67469	67469	I	0	” “
67475	67496	67469	67469	I	0	” replied the young lady : drawing her chair up to the table , and putting her elbows upon it . “
67510	67515	67506	67506	you	149	” said the Jew ; “
67518	67526	67506	67506	you	149	” and again the old man paused . “
67530	67534	67535	67535	I	0	” inquired Sikes . “
67562	67602	67556	67556	she	2241	” replied the Jew . At this confession , Miss Nancy burst into a loud laugh ; and , swallowing a glass of brandy , shook her head with an air of defiance , and burst into sundry exclamations of “
67610	67611	67556	67556	she	2241	” “
67616	67656	67556	67556	she	2241	” and the like . These seemed to have the effect of re - assuring both gentlemen ; for the Jew nodded his head with a satisfied air , and resumed his seat : as did Mr. Sikes likewise . “
67661	67668	67659	67659	Fagin	161	” said Nancy with a laugh . “
67677	67678	67670	67670	Bill	149	” “
67697	67708	67681	67681	you	149	” said the Jew , patting her on the neck . “
67730	67731	67734	67734	him	123	” “
67736	67740	67734	67734	him	123	” demanded Sikes . “
67751	67774	67775	67775	He	123	” replied the Jew in a hoarse whisper ; laying his finger on the side of his nose , and grinning frightfully . “
67777	67781	67785	67785	Bill	149	” exclaimed Sikes . “
67787	67791	67792	67792	I	0	” said Nancy . “
67846	67847	67844	67844	Bill	149	” “
67853	67857	67848	67848	I	0	” rejoined Fagin . “
67890	67891	67883	67884	the others	1362	” “
67902	67909	67883	67884	the others	1362	” said Mr. Sikes , ruminating . “
67922	67927	67928	67928	he	123	” interposed the Jew ; “
67943	67944	67938	67938	you	149	” “
67948	67952	67946	67946	him	123	” echoed Sikes . “
68011	68029	68030	68030	I	0	” said the robber , poising a crowbar , which he had drawn from under the bedstead . “
68037	68044	68030	68030	I	0	” said the Jew with energy . “
68106	68134	68135	68135	Ours	2252	” The old man crossed his arms upon his breast ; and , drawing his head and shoulders into a heap , literally hugged himself for joy . “
68137	68141	68142	68142	Yours	2252	” said Sikes . “
68147	68148	68144	68144	you	2252	” “
68156	68166	68167	68167	Mine	0	” said the Jew , with a shrill chuckle . “
68175	68176	68173	68173	Bill	149	” “
68180	68191	68173	68173	Bill	149	” said Sikes , scowling fiercely on his agreeable friend , “
68228	68229	68231	68231	they	2259	” “
68242	68251	68231	68231	they	2259	” replied the Jew , with some confusion , “
68297	68308	68309	68309	he	4736	” said the Jew , recovering his self - possession , “
68399	68400	68457	68457	Bill	149	” “
68408	68437	68457	68457	Bill	149	” asked Nancy , stopping some turbulent exclamation on the part of Mr. Sikes , expressive of the disgust with which he received Fagin ’s affectation of humanity . “
68444	68449	68457	68457	Bill	149	” said the Jew ; “
68459	68460	68461	68461	I	0	” “
68471	68479	68464	68464	Toby	201	” rejoined Sikes in a surly voice , “
68490	68491	68481	68481	he	201	” “
68494	68499	68481	68481	he	201	” said the Jew ; “
68505	68506	68481	68481	he	201	” “
68509	68513	68481	68481	he	201	” rejoined Sikes . “
68527	68535	68481	68481	he	201	” asked the Jew . Sikes nodded . “
68539	68540	68481	68481	he	201	” “
68550	68557	68481	68481	he	201	” rejoined Sikes , interrupting him . “
68607	68916	68584	68584	you	0	” After some discussion , in which all three took an active part , it was decided that Nancy should repair to the Jew ’s next evening when the night had set in , and bring Oliver away with her ; Fagin craftily observing , that , if he evinced any disinclination to the task , he would be more willing to accompany the girl who had so recently interfered in his behalf , than anybody else . It was also solemnly arranged that poor Oliver should , for the purposes of the contemplated expedition , be unreservedly consigned to the care and custody of Mr. William Sikes ; and further , that the said Sikes should deal with him as he thought fit ; and should not be held responsible by the Jew for any mischance or evil that might be necessary to visit him : it being understood that , to render the compact in this respect binding , any representations made by Mr. Sikes on his return should be required to be confirmed and corroborated , in all important particulars , by the testimony of flash Toby Crackit . These preliminaries adjusted , Mr. Sikes proceeded to drink brandy at a furious rate , and to flourish the crowbar in an alarming manner ; yelling forth , at the same time , most unmusical snatches of song , mingled with wild execrations . At length , in a fit of professional enthusiasm , he insisted upon producing his box of housebreaking tools : which he had no sooner stumbled in with , and opened for the purpose of explaining the nature and properties of the various implements it contained , and the peculiar beauties of their construction , than he fell over the box upon the floor , and went to sleep where he fell . “
68923	68934	68921	68921	Nancy	167	” said the Jew , muffling himself up as before . “
68939	69007	68921	68921	Nancy	167	” Their eyes met , and the Jew scrutinised her , narrowly . There was no flinching about the girl . She was as true and earnest in the matter as Toby Crackit himself could be . The Jew again bade her good - night , and , bestowing a sly kick upon the prostrate form of Mr. Sikes while her back was turned , groped downstairs . “
69012	69023	69027	69028	these women	2270	” muttered the Jew to himself as he turned homeward . “
69075	69112	69063	69064	The man	843	” Beguiling the time with these pleasant reflections , Mr. Fagin wended his way , through mud and mire , to his gloomy abode : where the Dodger was sitting up , impatiently awaiting his return . “
69126	69137	69119	69119	I	0	” was his first remark as they descended the stairs . “
69141	69151	69119	69119	I	0	” replied the Dodger , throwing open a door . “
69156	69252	69119	69119	I	0	” The boy was lying , fast asleep , on a rude bed upon the floor ; so pale with anxiety , and sadness , and the closeness of his prison , that he looked like death ; not death as it shows in shroud and coffin , but in the guise it wears when life has just departed ; when a young and gentle spirit has , but an instant , fled to Heaven , and the gross air of the world has not had time to breathe upon the changing dust it hallowed . “
69256	69265	69063	69064	The man	843	” said the Jew , turning softly away . “
69270	69395	69063	69064	The man	843	” CHAPTER XX . WHEREIN OLIVER IS DELIVERED OVER TO MR . WILLIAM SIKES When Oliver awoke in the morning , he was a good deal surprised to find that a new pair of shoes , with strong thick soles , had been placed at his bedside ; and that his old shoes had been removed . At first , he was pleased with the discovery : hoping that it might be the forerunner of his release ; but such thoughts were quickly dispelled , on his sitting down to breakfast along with the Jew , who told him , in a tone and manner which increased his alarm , that he was to be taken to the residence of Bill Sikes that night . “
69405	69411	69063	69064	The man	843	” asked Oliver , anxiously . “
69424	69429	69430	69430	We	2276	” replied the Jew . “
69479	69526	69527	69527	I	0	” The old man , who was stooping over the fire toasting a piece of bread , looked round as he bantered Oliver thus ; and chuckled as if to show that he knew he would still be very glad to get away if he could . “
69530	69541	69542	69542	you	4649	” said the Jew , fixing his eyes on Oliver , “
69560	69590	69547	69547	you	4649	” Oliver coloured , involuntarily , to find that the old thief had been reading his thoughts ; but boldly said , Yes , he did want to know . “
69597	69605	69594	69594	you	4649	” inquired Fagin , parrying the question . “
69614	69618	69607	69607	I	0	” replied Oliver . “
69621	69642	69607	69607	I	0	” said the Jew , turning away with a disappointed countenance from a close perusal of the boy ’s face . “
69651	69733	69645	69645	Bill	149	” The Jew seemed much vexed by Oliver ’s not expressing any greater curiosity on the subject ; but the truth is , that , although Oliver felt very anxious , he was too much confused by the earnest cunning of Fagin ’s looks , and his own speculations , to make any further inquiries just then . He had no other opportunity : for the Jew remained very surly and silent till night : when he prepared to go abroad . “
69740	69751	69645	69645	Bill	149	” said the Jew , putting one upon the table . “
69773	69774	69645	69645	Bill	149	” “
69779	69870	69645	69645	Bill	149	” replied Oliver , softly . The Jew walked to the door : looking over his shoulder at the boy as he went . Suddenly stopping , he called him by his name . Oliver looked up ; the Jew , pointing to the candle , motioned him to light it . He did so ; and , as he placed the candlestick upon the table , saw that the Jew was gazing fixedly at him , with lowering and contracted brows , from the dark end of the room . “
69879	69896	69897	69897	He	2281	” said the old man , shaking his right hand before him in a warning manner . “
69930	70559	69924	69924	he	2281	” Placing a strong emphasis on the last word , he suffered his features gradually to resolve themselves into a ghastly grin , and , nodding his head , left the room . Oliver leaned his head upon his hand when the old man disappeared , and pondered , with a trembling heart , on the words he had just heard . The more he thought of the Jew ’s admonition , the more he was at a loss to divine its real purpose and meaning . He could think of no bad object to be attained by sending him to Sikes , which would not be equally well answered by his remaining with Fagin ; and after meditating for a long time , concluded that he had been selected to perform some ordinary menial offices for the housebreaker , until another boy , better suited for his purpose could be engaged . He was too well accustomed to suffering , and had suffered too much where he was , to bewail the prospect of change very severely . He remained lost in thought for some minutes ; and then , with a heavy sigh , snuffed the candle , and , taking up the book which the Jew had left with him , began to read . He turned over the leaves . Carelessly at first ; but , lighting on a passage which attracted his attention , he soon became intent upon the volume . It was a history of the lives and trials of great criminals ; and the pages were soiled and thumbed with use . Here , he read of dreadful crimes that made the blood run cold ; of secret murders that had been committed by the lonely wayside ; of bodies hidden from the eye of man in deep pits and wells : which would not keep them down , deep as they were , but had yielded them up at last , after many years , and so maddened the murderers with the sight , that in their horror they had confessed their guilt , and yelled for the gibbet to end their agony . Here , too , he read of men who , lying in their beds at dead of night , had been tempted ( so they said ) and led on , by their own bad thoughts , to such dreadful bloodshed as it made the flesh creep , and the limbs quail , to think of . The terrible descriptions were so real and vivid , that the sallow pages seemed to turn red with gore ; and the words upon them , to be sounded in his ears , as if they were whispered , in hollow murmurs , by the spirits of the dead . In a paroxysm of fear , the boy closed the book , and thrust it from him . Then , falling upon his knees , he prayed Heaven to spare him from such deeds ; and rather to will that he should die at once , than be reserved for crimes , so fearful and appalling . By degrees , he grew more calm , and besought , in a low and broken voice , that he might be rescued from his present dangers ; and that if any aid were to be raised up for a poor outcast boy who had never known the love of friends or kindred , it might come to him now , when , desolate and deserted , he stood alone in the midst of wickedness and guilt . He had concluded his prayer , but still remained with his head buried in his hands , when a rustling noise aroused him . “
70564	70582	69924	69924	he	2281	” he cried , starting up , and catching sight of a figure standing by the door . “
70587	70588	70589	70589	Me	0	” “
70594	70618	70589	70589	Me	0	” replied a tremulous voice . Oliver raised the candle above his head : and looked towards the door . It was Nancy . “
70624	70634	70589	70589	Me	0	” said the girl , turning away her head . “
70640	70681	70589	70589	Me	0	” Oliver saw that she was very pale , and gently inquired if she were ill . The girl threw herself into a chair , with her back towards him : and wrung her hands ; but made no reply . “
70686	70693	70684	70684	me	0	” she cried after a while , “
70700	70701	70684	70684	me	0	” “
70706	70710	70684	70684	me	0	” asked Oliver . “
70727	70750	70751	70751	Nancy	167	” She rocked herself to and fro ; caught her throat ; and , uttering a gurgling sound , gasped for breath . “
70753	70757	70751	70751	Nancy	167	” cried Oliver , “
70762	70832	70751	70751	Nancy	167	” The girl beat her hands upon her knees , and her feet upon the ground ; and , suddenly stopping , drew her shawl close round her : and shivered with cold . Oliver stirred the fire . Drawing her chair close to it , she sat there , for a little time , without speaking ; but at length she raised her head , and looked round . “
70843	70856	70864	70864	I	0	” said she , affecting to busy herself in arranging her dress ; “
70877	70878	70869	70869	Nolly	123	” “
70886	70890	70880	70880	I	0	” asked Oliver . “
70899	70904	70897	70897	Bill	149	” replied the girl . “
70912	70913	70905	70905	You	0	” “
70917	70923	70905	70905	You	0	” asked Oliver , recoiling . “
70927	70950	70905	70905	You	0	” echoed the girl , raising her eyes , and averting them again , the moment they encountered the boy ’s face . “
70957	70958	70959	70959	I	0	” “
70965	70975	70959	70959	I	0	” said Oliver : who had watched her closely . “
70982	70991	70978	70978	your	4730	” rejoined the girl , affecting to laugh . “
70998	71140	70978	70978	your	4730	” Oliver could see that he had some power over the girl ’s better feelings , and , for an instant , thought of appealing to her compassion for his helpless state . But , then , the thought darted across his mind that it was barely eleven o’clock ; and that many people were still in the streets : of whom surely some might be found to give credence to his tale . As the reflection occured to him , he stepped forward : and said , somewhat hastily , that he was ready . Neither his brief consideration , nor its purport , was lost on his companion . She eyed him narrowly , while he spoke ; and cast upon him a look of intelligence which sufficiently showed that she guessed what had been passing in his thoughts . “
71143	71163	71164	71164	You	2286	” said the girl , stooping over him , and pointing to the door as she looked cautiously round . “
71206	71246	71247	71247	I	0	” Struck by the energy of her manner , Oliver looked up in her face with great surprise . She seemed to speak the truth ; her countenance was white and agitated ; and she trembled with very earnestness . “
71268	71274	71264	71264	I	0	” continued the girl aloud ; “
71350	71373	71344	71344	God	171	” She pointed , hastily , to some livid bruises on her neck and arms ; and continued , with great rapidity : “
71449	71708	71446	71446	Your	2286	” She caught the hand which Oliver instinctively placed in hers , and , blowing out the light , drew him after her up the stairs . The door was opened , quickly , by some one shrouded in the darkness , and was as quickly closed , when they had passed out . A hackney - cabriolet was in waiting ; with the same vehemence which she had exhibited in addressing Oliver , the girl pulled him in with her , and drew the curtains close . The driver wanted no directions , but lashed his horse into full speed , without the delay of an instant . The girl still held Oliver fast by the hand , and continued to pour into his ear , the warnings and assurances she had already imparted . All was so quick and hurried , that he had scarcely time to recollect where he was , or how he came there , when the carriage stopped at the house to which the Jew ’s steps had been directed on the previous evening . For one brief moment , Oliver cast a hurried glance along the empty street , and a cry for help hung upon his lips . But the girl ’s voice was in his ear , beseeching him in such tones of agony to remember her , that he had not the heart to utter it . While he hesitated , the opportunity was gone ; he was already in the house , and the door was shut . “
71712	71725	71726	71726	Bill	149	” said the girl , releasing her hold for the first time . “
71728	71729	71726	71726	Bill	149	” “
71732	71748	71726	71726	Bill	149	” replied Sikes : appearing at the head of the stairs , with a candle . “
71761	71796	71726	71726	Bill	149	” This was a very strong expression of approbation , an uncommonly hearty welcome , from a person of Mr. Sikes ’ temperament . Nancy , appearing much gratified thereby , saluted him cordially . “
71806	71816	71817	71817	He	199	” observed Sikes , as he lighted them up . “
71825	71826	71817	71817	He	199	” “
71831	71835	71817	71817	He	199	” rejoined Nancy . “
71843	71861	71837	71837	you	2289	” said Sikes when they had all reached the room : closing the door as he spoke . “
71868	71872	71865	71865	he	199	” replied Nancy . “
71878	71882	71874	71874	he	199	” inquired Sikes . “
71887	71891	71892	71892	I	0	” rejoined Nancy . “
71899	71908	71892	71892	I	0	” said Sikes , looking grimly at Oliver ; “
71950	71996	71934	71934	me	0	” Thus addressing his new pupil , Mr. Sikes pulled off Oliver ’s cap and threw it into a corner ; and then , taking him by the shoulder , sat himself down by the table , and stood the boy in front of him . “
72008	72030	72002	72002	you	5361	” inquired Sikes , taking up a pocket - pistol which lay on the table . Oliver replied in the affirmative . “
72038	72042	72002	72002	you	5361	” continued Sikes . “
72068	72095	72114	72114	I	0	” Oliver murmured his comprehension of the different bodies referred to ; and Mr. Sikes proceeded to load the pistol , with great nicety and deliberation . “
72101	72111	72114	72114	I	0	” said Mr. Sikes , when he had finished . “
72121	72125	72119	72119	sir	4543	” replied Oliver . “
72128	72162	72119	72119	sir	4543	” said the robber , grasping Oliver ’s wrist , and putting the barrel so close to his temple that they touched ; at which moment the boy could not repress a start ; “
72214	72235	72210	72210	your	5361	” Having bestowed a scowl upon the object of this warning , to increase its effect , Mr. Sikes continued . “
72294	72295	72292	72292	me	0	” “
72306	72330	72292	72292	me	0	” said Nancy : speaking very emphatically , and slightly frowning at Oliver as if to bespeak his serious attention to her words : “
72395	72396	72425	72425	they	1161	” “
72401	72408	72409	72409	women	1161	” observed Mr. Sikes , approvingly ; “
72453	72508	72425	72425	they	1161	” In pursuance of this request , Nancy quickly laid the cloth ; disappearing for a few minutes , she presently returned with a pot of porter and a dish of sheep ’s heads : which gave occasion to several pleasant witticisms on the part of Mr. Sikes , founded upon the singular coincidence of “
72510	72846	72425	72425	they	1161	” being a can name , common to them , and also to an ingenious implement much used in his profession . Indeed , the worthy gentleman , stimulated perhaps by the immediate prospect of being on active service , was in great spirits and good humour ; in proof whereof , it may be here remarked , that he humourously drank all the beer at a draught , and did not utter , on a rough calculation , more than four - score oaths during the whole progress of the meal . Supper being ended — it may be easily conceived that Oliver had no great appetite for it — Mr. Sikes disposed of a couple of glasses of spirits and water , and threw himself on the bed ; ordering Nancy , with many imprecations in case of failure , to call him at five precisely . Oliver stretched himself in his clothes , by command of the same authority , on a mattress upon the floor ; and the girl , mending the fire , sat before it , in readiness to rouse them at the appointed time . For a long time Oliver lay awake , thinking it not impossible that Nancy might seek that opportunity of whispering some further advice ; but the girl sat brooding over the fire , without moving , save now and then to trim the light . Weary with watching and anxiety , he at length fell asleep . When he awoke , the table was covered with tea - things , and Sikes was thrusting various articles into the pockets of his great - coat , which hung over the back of a chair . Nancy was busily engaged in preparing breakfast . It was not yet daylight ; for the candle was still burning , and it was quite dark outside . A sharp rain , too , was beating against the window - panes ; and the sky looked black and cloudy . “
72851	72860	72425	72425	they	1161	” growled Sikes , as Oliver started up ; “
72884	73864	73904	73906	Lazy - legs	2299	” Oliver was not long in making his toilet ; having taken some breakfast , he replied to a surly inquiry from Sikes , by saying that he was quite ready . Nancy , scarcely looking at the boy , threw him a handkerchief to tie round his throat ; Sikes gave him a large rough cape to button over his shoulders . Thus attired , he gave his hand to the robber , who , merely pausing to show him with a menacing gesture that he had that same pistol in a side - pocket of his great - coat , clasped it firmly in his , and , exchanging a farewell with Nancy , led him away . Oliver turned , for an instant , when they reached the door , in the hope of meeting a look from the girl . But she had resumed her old seat in front of the fire , and sat , perfectly motionless before it . CHAPTER XXI . THE EXPEDITION It was a cheerless morning when they got into the street ; blowing and raining hard ; and the clouds looking dull and stormy . The night had been very wet : large pools of water had collected in the road : and the kennels were overflowing . There was a faint glimmering of the coming day in the sky ; but it rather aggravated than relieved the gloom of the scene : the sombre light only serving to pale that which the street lamps afforded , without shedding any warmer or brighter tints upon the wet house - tops , and dreary streets . There appeared to be nobody stirring in that quarter of the town ; the windows of the houses were all closely shut ; and the streets through which they passed , were noiseless and empty . By the time they had turned into the Bethnal Green Road , the day had fairly begun to break . Many of the lamps were already extinguished ; a few country waggons were slowly toiling on , towards London ; now and then , a stage - coach , covered with mud , rattled briskly by : the driver bestowing , as he passed , an admonitory lash upon the heavy waggoner who , by keeping on the wrong side of the road , had endangered his arriving at the office , a quarter of a minute after his time . The public - houses , with gas - lights burning inside , were already open . By degrees , other shops began to be unclosed , and a few scattered people were met with . Then , came straggling groups of labourers going to their work ; then , men and women with fish - baskets on their heads ; donkey - carts laden with vegetables ; chaise - carts filled with live - stock or whole carcasses of meat ; milk - women with pails ; an unbroken concourse of people , trudging out with various supplies to the eastern suburbs of the town . As they approached the City , the noise and traffic gradually increased ; when they threaded the streets between Shoreditch and Smithfield , it had swelled into a roar of sound and bustle . It was as light as it was likely to be , till night came on again , and the busy morning of half the London population had begun . Turning down Sun Street and Crown Street , and crossing Finsbury square , Mr. Sikes struck , by way of Chiswell Street , into Barbican : thence into Long Lane , and so into Smithfield ; from which latter place arose a tumult of discordant sounds that filled Oliver Twist with amazement . It was market - morning . The ground was covered , nearly ankle - deep , with filth and mire ; a thick steam , perpetually rising from the reeking bodies of the cattle , and mingling with the fog , which seemed to rest upon the chimney - tops , hung heavily above . All the pens in the centre of the large area , and as many temporary pens as could be crowded into the vacant space , were filled with sheep ; tied up to posts by the gutter side were long lines of beasts and oxen , three or four deep . Countrymen , butchers , drovers , hawkers , boys , thieves , idlers , and vagabonds of every low grade , were mingled together in a mass ; the whistling of drovers , the barking dogs , the bellowing and plunging of the oxen , the bleating of sheep , the grunting and squeaking of pigs , the cries of hawkers , the shouts , oaths , and quarrelling on all sides ; the ringing of bells and roar of voices , that issued from every public - house ; the crowding , pushing , driving , beating , whooping and yelling ; the hideous and discordant dim that resounded from every corner of the market ; and the unwashed , unshaven , squalid , and dirty figures constantly running to and fro , and bursting in and out of the throng ; rendered it a stunning and bewildering scene , which quite confounded the senses . Mr. Sikes , dragging Oliver after him , elbowed his way through the thickest of the crowd , and bestowed very little attention on the numerous sights and sounds , which so astonished the boy . He nodded , twice or thrice , to a passing friend ; and , resisting as many invitations to take a morning dram , pressed steadily onward , until they were clear of the turmoil , and had made their way through Hosier Lane into Holborn . “
73871	73886	73904	73906	Lazy - legs	2299	” said Sikes , looking up at the clock of St. Andrew ’s Church , “
73908	74005	73904	73906	Lazy - legs	2299	” Mr. Sikes accompanied this speech with a jerk at his little companion ’s wrist ; Oliver , quickening his pace into a kind of trot between a fast walk and a run , kept up with the rapid strides of the house - breaker as well as he could . They held their course at this rate , until they had passed Hyde Park corner , and were on their way to Kensington : when Sikes relaxed his pace , until an empty cart which was at some little distance behind , came up . Seeing “
74007	74037	74095	74095	he	2303	” written on it , he asked the driver with as much civility as he could assume , if he would give them a lift as far as Isleworth . “
74041	74046	74095	74095	he	2303	” said the man . “
74052	74053	74049	74050	your boy	2301	” “
74061	74083	74056	74056	he	2301	” replied Sikes , looking hard at Oliver , and putting his hand abstractedly into the pocket where the pistol was . “
74100	74113	74095	74095	he	2303	” inquired the driver : seeing that Oliver was out of breath . “
74120	74126	74127	74127	He	2303	” replied Sikes , interposing . “
74147	74316	74145	74145	you	2301	” Thus addressing Oliver , he helped him into the cart ; and the driver , pointing to a heap of sacks , told him to lie down there , and rest himself . As they passed the different mile - stones , Oliver wondered , more and more , where his companion meant to take him . Kensington , Hammersmith , Chiswick , Kew Bridge , Brentford , were all passed ; and yet they went on as steadily as if they had only just begun their journey . At length , they came to a public - house called the Coach and Horses ; a little way beyond which , another road appeared to run off . And here , the cart stopped . Sikes dismounted with great precipitation , holding Oliver by the hand all the while ; and lifting him down directly , bestowed a furious look upon him , and rapped the side - pocket with his fist , in a significant manner . “
74323	74328	74321	74321	boy	4595	” said the man . “
74333	74342	74343	74343	he	2306	” replied Sikes , giving him a shake ; “
74356	74357	74359	74359	I	0	” “
74361	74371	74359	74359	I	0	” rejoined the other , getting into his cart . “
74381	74498	74499	74499	Hampton	206	” And he drove away . Sikes waited until he had fairly gone ; and then , telling Oliver he might look about him if he wanted , once again led him onward on his journey . They turned round to the left , a short way past the public - house ; and then , taking a right - hand road , walked on for a long time : passing many large gardens and gentlemen ’s houses on both sides of the way , and stopping for nothing but a little beer , until they reached a town . Here against the wall of a house , Oliver saw written up in pretty large letters , “
74501	74763	74499	74499	Hampton	206	” They lingered about , in the fields , for some hours . At length they came back into the town ; and , turning into an old public - house with a defaced sign - board , ordered some dinner by the kitchen fire . The kitchen was an old , low - roofed room ; with a great beam across the middle of the ceiling , and benches , with high backs to them , by the fire ; on which were seated several rough men in smock - frocks , drinking and smoking . They took no notice of Oliver ; and very little of Sikes ; and , as Sikes took very little notice of them , he and his young comrade sat in a corner by themselves , without being much troubled by their company . They had some cold meat for dinner , and sat so long after it , while Mr. Sikes indulged himself with three or four pipes , that Oliver began to feel quite certain they were not going any further . Being much tired with the walk , and getting up so early , he dozed a little at first ; then , quite overpowered by fatigue and the fumes of the tobacco , fell asleep . It was quite dark when he was awakened by a push from Sikes . Rousing himself sufficiently to sit up and look about him , he found that worthy in close fellowship and communication with a labouring man , over a pint of ale . “
74777	74781	74775	74775	you	2307	” inquired Sikes . “
74787	74811	74784	74784	I	0	” replied the man , who seemed a little the worse — or better , as the case might be — for drinking ; “
74868	74869	74859	74859	Ecod	207	” “
74884	74896	74871	74871	you	2307	” demanded Sikes , pushing the ale towards his new friend . “
74906	74917	74898	74898	you	2307	” replied the man , looking out of the pot . “
74924	74925	74919	74919	you	2307	” “
74931	74935	74919	74919	you	2307	” replied Sikes . “
74947	74952	74938	74939	your man	2311	” replied the other . “
74959	74960	74957	74957	Becky	208	” “
74969	74974	74975	74975	I	0	” replied the girl . “
74978	74987	74993	74993	you	208	” said the man , with tipsy gravity ; “
74996	74997	74993	74993	you	208	” “
75001	75005	75006	75006	You	0	” rejoined Sikes . “
75032	75194	75006	75006	You	0	” The stranger reflected upon this argument , with a very profound face ; having done so , he seized Sikes by the hand : and declared he was a real good fellow . To which Mr. Sikes replied , he was joking ; as , if he had been sober , there would have been strong reason to suppose he was . After the exchange of a few more compliments , they bade the company good - night , and went out ; the girl gathering up the pots and glasses as they did so , and lounging out to the door , with her hands full , to see the party start . The horse , whose health had been drunk in his absence , was standing outside : ready harnessed to the cart . Oliver and Sikes got in without any further ceremony ; and the man to whom he belonged , having lingered for a minute or two “
75200	75639	75006	75006	You	0	” and to defy the hostler and the world to produce his equal , mounted also . Then , the hostler was told to give the horse his head ; and , his head being given him , he made a very unpleasant use of it : tossing it into the air with great disdain , and running into the parlour windows over the way ; after performing those feats , and supporting himself for a short time on his hind - legs , he started off at great speed , and rattled out of the town right gallantly . The night was very dark . A damp mist rose from the river , and the marshy ground about ; and spread itself over the dreary fields . It was piercing cold , too ; all was gloomy and black . Not a word was spoken ; for the driver had grown sleepy ; and Sikes was in no mood to lead him into conversation . Oliver sat huddled together , in a corner of the cart ; bewildered with alarm and apprehension ; and figuring strange objects in the gaunt trees , whose branches waved grimly to and fro , as if in some fantastic joy at the desolation of the scene . As they passed Sunbury Church , the clock struck seven . There was a light in the ferry - house window opposite : which streamed across the road , and threw into more sombre shadow a dark yew - tree with graves beneath it . There was a dull sound of falling water not far off ; and the leaves of the old tree stirred gently in the night wind . It seemed like quiet music for the repose of the dead . Sunbury was passed through , and they came again into the lonely road . Two or three miles more , and the cart stopped . Sikes alighted , took Oliver by the hand , and they once again walked on . They turned into no house at Shepperton , as the weary boy had expected ; but still kept walking on , in mud and darkness , through gloomy lanes and over cold open wastes , until they came within sight of the lights of a town at no great distance . On looking intently forward , Oliver saw that the water was just below them , and that they were coming to the foot of a bridge . Sikes kept straight on , until they were close upon the bridge ; then turned suddenly down a bank upon the left . “
75643	75652	75653	75653	He	2316	” thought Oliver , turning sick with fear . “
75665	75778	75653	75653	He	2316	” He was about to throw himself on the ground , and make one struggle for his young life , when he saw that they stood before a solitary house : all ruinous and decayed . There was a window on each side of the dilapidated entrance ; and one story above ; but no light was visible . The house was dark , dismantled : and , to all appearance , uninhabited . Sikes , with Oliver ’s hand still in his , softly approached the low porch , and raised the latch . The door yielded to the pressure , and they passed in together . CHAPTER XXII . THE BURGLARY “
75781	75799	75653	75653	He	2316	” cried a loud , hoarse voice , as soon as they set foot in the passage . “
75807	75815	75817	75818	a glim	2317	” said Sikes , bolting the door . “
75822	75823	75817	75818	a glim	2317	” “
75829	75835	75836	75837	A glim	2317	” cried the same voice . “
75858	75916	75845	75846	the gentleman	4594	” The speaker appeared to throw a boot - jack , or some such article , at the person he addressed , to rouse him from his slumbers : for the noise of a wooden body , falling violently , was heard ; and then an indistinct muttering , as of a man between sleep and awake . “
75921	75927	75918	75918	you	2322	” cried the same voice . “
75980	76060	75970	75970	you	2322	” A pair of slipshod feet shuffled , hastily , across the bare floor of the room , as this interrogatory was put ; and there issued , from a door on the right hand ; first , a feeble candle : and next , the form of the same individual who has been heretofore described as labouring under the infirmity of speaking through his nose , and officiating as waiter at the public - house on Saffron Hill . “
76064	76074	75970	75970	you	2322	” exclaimed Barney , with real or counterfeit joy ; “
76084	76085	76082	76082	i	0	” “
76093	76104	76088	76088	you	2322	” said Sikes , putting Oliver in front of him . “
76115	76322	76323	76323	Bill	149	” Muttering a curse upon his tardiness , Sikes pushed Oliver before him ; and they entered a low dark room with a smoky fire , two or three broken chairs , a table , and a very old couch : on which , with his legs much higher than his head , a man was reposing at full length , smoking a long clay pipe . He was dressed in a smartly - cut snuff - coloured coat , with large brass buttons ; an orange neckerchief ; a coarse , staring , shawl - pattern waistcoat ; and drab breeches . Mr. Crackit ( for he it was ) had no very great quantity of hair , either upon his head or face ; but what he had , was of a reddish dye , and tortured into long corkscrew curls , through which he occasionally thrust some very dirty fingers , ornamented with large common rings . He was a trifle above the middle size , and apparently rather weak in the legs ; but this circumstance by no means detracted from his own admiration of his top - boots , which he contemplated , in their elevated situation , with lively satisfaction . “
76328	76340	76323	76323	Bill	149	” said this figure , turning his head towards the door , “
76371	76405	76406	76407	The boy	423	” Uttering this exclamation in a tone of great surprise , as his eyes rested on Oliver , Mr. Toby Crackit brought himself into a sitting posture , and demanded who that was . “
76413	76424	76425	76428	Wud of Bister Fagid	210	” replied Sikes , drawing a chair towards the fire . “
76432	76440	76425	76430	Wud of Bister Fagid ’s lads	2329	” exclaimed Barney , with a grin . “
76446	76454	76425	76430	Wud of Bister Fagid ’s lads	2329	” exclaimed Toby , looking at Oliver . “
76481	76482	76472	76472	His	423	” “
76491	76530	76472	76472	His	423	” interposed Sikes , impatiently ; and stooping over his recumbant friend , he whispered a few words in his ear : at which Mr. Crackit laughed immensely , and honoured Oliver with a long stare of astonishment . “
76533	76543	76581	76581	younker	2333	” said Sikes , as he resumed his seat , “
76605	76647	76588	76588	you	2333	” Oliver looked at Sikes , in mute and timid wonder ; and drawing a stool to the fire , sat with his aching head upon his hands , scarcely knowing where he was , or what was passing around him . “
76650	76671	76588	76588	you	2333	” said Toby , as the young Jew placed some fragments of food , and a bottle upon the table , “
76677	76719	76588	76588	you	2333	” He rose to honour the toast ; and , carefully depositing his empty pipe in a corner , advanced to the table , filled a glass with spirits , and drank off its contents . Mr. Sikes did the same . “
76726	76738	76743	76743	innocence	2336	” said Toby , half - filling a wine - glass . “
76745	76746	76743	76743	innocence	2336	” “
76749	76762	76765	76765	I	0	” said Oliver , looking piteously up into the man ’s face ; “
76767	76768	76765	76765	I	0	” “
76773	76777	76765	76765	I	0	” echoed Toby . “
76799	76800	76797	76797	Bill	149	” “
76805	76815	76801	76801	He	423	” said Sikes clapping his hand upon his pocket . “
76843	77101	77106	77106	Barney	187	” Frightened by the menacing gestures of the two men , Oliver hastily swallowed the contents of the glass , and immediately fell into a violent fit of coughing : which delighted Toby Crackit and Barney , and even drew a smile from the surly Mr. Sikes . This done , and Sikes having satisfied his appetite ( Oliver could eat nothing but a small crust of bread which they made him swallow ) , the two men laid themselves down on chairs for a short nap . Oliver retained his stool by the fire ; Barney wrapped in a blanket , stretched himself on the floor : close outside the fender . They slept , or appeared to sleep , for some time ; nobody stirring but Barney , who rose once or twice to throw coals on the fire . Oliver fell into a heavy doze : imagining himself straying along the gloomy lanes , or wandering about the dark churchyard , or retracing some one or other of the scenes of the past day : when he was roused by Toby Crackit jumping up and declaring it was half - past one . In an instant , the other two were on their legs , and all were actively engaged in busy preparation . Sikes and his companion enveloped their necks and chins in large dark shawls , and drew on their great - coats ; Barney , opening a cupboard , brought forth several articles , which he hastily crammed into the pockets . “
77108	77113	77106	77106	Barney	187	” said Toby Crackit . “
77118	77128	77129	77129	You	2339	” replied Barney , producing a pair of pistols . “
77134	77135	77132	77132	yourself	2339	” “
77139	77147	77148	77149	The persuaders	2340	” replied Toby , stowing them away . “
77151	77152	77148	77149	The persuaders	2340	” “
77158	77162	77153	77153	I	0	” replied Sikes . “
77176	77194	77153	77153	I	0	” inquired Toby : fastening a small crowbar to a loop inside the skirt of his coat . “
77198	77203	77153	77153	I	0	” rejoined his companion . “
77219	77251	77153	77153	I	0	” With these words , he took a thick stick from Barney ’s hands , who , having delivered another to Toby , busied himself in fastening on Oliver ’s cape . “
77255	77302	77153	77153	I	0	” said Sikes , holding out his hand . Oliver : who was completely stupified by the unwonted exercise , and the air , and the drink which had been forced upon him : put his hand mechanically into that which Sikes extended for the purpose . “
77310	77314	77308	77308	Toby	201	” said Sikes . “
77320	77471	77318	77318	Barney	187	” The man went to the door , and returned to announce that all was quiet . The two robbers issued forth with Oliver between them . Barney , having made all fast , rolled himself up as before , and was soon asleep again . It was now intensely dark . The fog was much heavier than it had been in the early part of the night ; and the atmosphere was so damp , that , although no rain fell , Oliver ’s hair and eyebrows , within a few minutes after leaving the house , had become stiff with the half - frozen moisture that was floating about . They crossed the bridge , and kept on towards the lights which he had seen before . They were at no great distance off ; and , as they walked pretty briskly , they soon arrived at Chertsey . “
77477	77481	77318	77318	Barney	187	” whispered Sikes ; “
77496	77622	77623	77624	The boy	423	” Toby acquiesced ; and they hurried through the main street of the little town , which at that late hour was wholly deserted . A dim light shone at intervals from some bed - room window ; and the hoarse barking of dogs occasionally broke the silence of the night . But there was nobody abroad . They had cleared the town , as the church - bell struck two . Quickening their pace , they turned up a road upon the left hand . After walking about a quarter of a mile , they stopped before a detached house surrounded by a wall : to the top of which , Toby Crackit , scarcely pausing to take breath , climbed in a twinkling . “
77627	77631	77623	77624	The boy	423	” said Toby . “
77643	77770	77636	77636	I	0	” Before Oliver had time to look round , Sikes had caught him under the arms ; and in three or four seconds he and Toby were lying on the grass on the other side . Sikes followed directly . And they stole cautiously towards the house . And now , for the first time , Oliver , well - nigh mad with grief and terror , saw that housebreaking and robbery , if not murder , were the objects of the expedition . He clasped his hands together , and involuntarily uttered a subdued exclamation of horror . A mist came before his eyes ; the cold sweat stood upon his ashy face ; his limbs failed him ; and he sank upon his knees . “
77774	77790	77636	77636	I	0	” murmured Sikes , trembling with rage , and drawing the pistol from his pocket ; “
77804	77805	77795	77795	I	0	” “
77816	77820	77795	77795	I	0	” cried Oliver ; “
77875	77921	77971	77971	Bill	149	” The man to whom this appeal was made , swore a dreadful oath , and had cocked the pistol , when Toby , striking it from his grasp , placed his hand upon the boy ’s mouth , and dragged him to the house . “
77924	77929	77971	77971	Bill	149	” cried the man ; “
78012	78172	77988	77988	I	0	” Sikes , invoking terrific imprecations upon Fagin ’s head for sending Oliver on such an errand , plied the crowbar vigorously , but with little noise . After some delay , and some assistance from Toby , the shutter to which he had referred , swung open on its hinges . It was a little lattice window , about five feet and a half above the ground , at the back of the house : which belonged to a scullery , or small brewing - place , at the end of the passage . The aperture was so small , that the inmates had probably not thought it worth while to defend it more securely ; but it was large enough to admit a boy of Oliver ’s size , nevertheless . A very brief exercise of Mr. Sikes ’s art , sufficed to overcome the fastening of the lattice ; and it soon stood wide open also . “
78180	78202	78176	78176	you	2351	” whispered Sikes , drawing a dark lantern from his pocket , and throwing the glare full on Oliver ’s face ; “
78245	78246	78297	78299	the old lady	1080	” “
78263	78267	78297	78299	the old lady	1080	” interposed Toby . “
78303	78304	78297	78299	the old lady	1080	” “
78312	78321	78297	78299	the old lady	1080	” replied Sikes , with a threatening look . “
78332	78333	78393	78393	Barney	187	” “
78336	78347	78393	78393	Barney	187	” replied Toby , after peeping in to satisfy himself . “
78403	78522	78393	78393	Barney	187	” Although Mr. Crackit spoke in a scarcely audible whisper , and laughed without noise , Sikes imperiously commanded him to be silent , and to get to work . Toby complied , by first producing his lantern , and placing it on the ground ; then by planting himself firmly with his head against the wall beneath the window , and his hands upon his knees , so as to make a step of his back . This was no sooner done , than Sikes , mounting upon him , put Oliver gently through the window with his feet first ; and , without leaving hold of his collar , planted him safely on the floor inside . “
78527	78536	78393	78393	Barney	187	” said Sikes , looking into the room . “
78544	78555	78537	78537	You	2364	” Oliver , more dead than alive , gasped out , “
78558	78601	78537	78537	You	2364	” Sikes , pointing to the street - door with the pistol - barrel , briefly advised him to take notice that he was within shot all the way ; and that if he faltered , he would fall dead that instant . “
78609	78619	78621	78621	I	0	” said Sikes , in the same low whisper . “
78633	78634	78621	78621	I	0	” “
78639	78649	78621	78621	I	0	” whispered the other man . They listened intently . “
78652	78662	78621	78621	I	0	” said Sikes , releasing his hold of Oliver . “
78665	78724	78621	78621	I	0	” In the short time he had had to collect his senses , the boy had firmly resolved that , whether he died in the attempt or not , he would make one effort to dart upstairs from the hall , and alarm the family . Filled with this idea , he advanced at once , but stealthily . “
78728	78734	78621	78621	I	0	” suddenly cried Sikes aloud . “
78739	78875	78621	78621	I	0	” Scared by the sudden breaking of the dead stillness of the place , and by a loud cry which followed it , Oliver let his lantern fall , and knew not whether to advance or fly . The cry was repeated — a light appeared — a vision of two terrified half - dressed men at the top of the stairs swam before his eyes — a flash — a loud noise — a smoke — a crash somewhere , but where he knew not,—and he staggered back . Sikes had disappeared for an instant ; but he was up again , and had him by the collar before the smoke had cleared away . He fired his own pistol after the men , who were already retreating ; and dragged the boy up . “
78881	78893	78621	78621	I	0	” said Sikes , as he drew him through the window . “
78912	79322	78900	78900	They	2366	” Then came the loud ringing of a bell , mingled with the noise of fire - arms , and the shouts of men , and the sensation of being carried over uneven ground at a rapid pace . And then , the noises grew confused in the distance ; and a cold deadly feeling crept over the boy ’s heart ; and he saw or heard no more . CHAPTER XXIII . WHICH CONTAINS THE SUBSTANCE OF A PLEASANT CONVERSATION BETWEEN MR . BUMBLE AND A LADY ; AND SHOWS THAT EVEN A BEADLE MAY BE SUSCEPTIBLE ON SOME POINTS The night was bitter cold . The snow lay on the ground , frozen into a hard thick crust , so that only the heaps that had drifted into byways and corners were affected by the sharp wind that howled abroad : which , as if expending increased fury on such prey as it found , caught it savagely up in clouds , and , whirling it into a thousand misty eddies , scattered it in air . Bleak , dark , and piercing cold , it was a night for the well - housed and fed to draw round the bright fire and thank God they were at home ; and for the homeless , starving wretch to lay him down and die . Many hunger - worn outcasts close their eyes in our bare streets , at such times , who , let their crimes have been what they may , can hardly open them in a more bitter world . Such was the aspect of out - of - doors affairs , when Mrs. Corney , the matron of the workhouse to which our readers have been already introduced as the birthplace of Oliver Twist , sat herself down before a cheerful fire in her own little room , and glanced , with no small degree of complacency , at a small round table : on which stood a tray of corresponding size , furnished with all necessary materials for the most grateful meal that matrons enjoy . In fact , Mrs. Corney was about to solace herself with a cup of tea . As she glanced from the table to the fireplace , where the smallest of all possible kettles was singing a small song in a small voice , her inward satisfaction evidently increased,—so much so , indeed , that Mrs. Corney smiled . “
79325	79344	79345	79345	I	0	” said the matron , leaning her elbow on the table , and looking reflectively at the fire ; “
79374	79468	79345	79345	I	0	” Mrs. Corney shook her head mournfully , as if deploring the mental blindness of those paupers who did not know it ; and thrusting a silver spoon ( private property ) into the inmost recesses of a two - ounce tin tea - caddy , proceeded to make the tea . How slight a thing will disturb the equanimity of our frail minds ! The black teapot , being very small and easily filled , ran over while Mrs. Corney was moralising ; and the water slightly scalded Mrs. Corney ’s hand . “
79473	79488	79345	79345	I	0	” said the worthy matron , setting it down very hastily on the hob ; “
79513	79520	79509	79509	anybody	421	” said Mrs. Corney , pausing , “
79533	79602	79603	79603	I	0	” With these words , the matron dropped into her chair , and , once more resting her elbow on the table , thought of her solitary fate . The small teapot , and the single cup , had awakened in her mind sad recollections of Mr. Corney ( who had not been dead more than five - and - twenty years ) ; and she was overpowered . “
79609	79616	79603	79603	I	0	” said Mrs. Corney , pettishly ; “
79626	79688	79603	79603	I	0	” Whether this remark bore reference to the husband , or the teapot , is uncertain . It might have been the latter ; for Mrs. Corney looked at it as she spoke ; and took it up afterwards . She had just tasted her first cup , when she was disturbed by a soft tap at the room - door . “
79696	79703	79603	79603	I	0	” said Mrs. Corney , sharply . “
79744	79745	79748	79748	ma’am	4840	” “
79752	79759	79748	79748	ma’am	4840	” replied a man ’s voice . “
79763	79774	79777	79778	Mr. Bumble	128	” exclaimed the matron , in a much sweeter tone , “
79780	79781	79777	79778	Mr. Bumble	128	” “
79788	79834	79777	79778	Mr. Bumble	128	” said Mr. Bumble , who had been stopping outside to rub his shoes clean , and to shake the snow off his coat ; and who now made his appearance , bearing the cocked hat in one hand and a bundle in the other . “
79843	79888	79836	79836	I	0	” The lady modestly hesitated to reply , lest there should be any impropriety in holding an interview with Mr. Bumble , with closed doors . Mr. Bumble taking advantage of the hesitation , and being very cold himself , shut it without permission . “
79895	79900	79892	79893	Mr. Bumble	128	” said the matron . “
79907	79912	79905	79905	ma’am	4840	” replied the beadle . “
79959	79960	79987	79987	ma’am	4840	” “
79973	79982	79970	79971	Mr. Bumble	128	” said the matron , sipping her tea . “
79989	79994	79987	79987	ma’am	4840	” rejoined Mr. Bumble . “
80128	80146	80147	80147	I	0	” The matron expressed her entire concurrence in this intelligible simile ; and the beadle went on . “
80150	80155	80147	80147	I	0	” said Mr. Bumble , “
80353	80354	80344	80344	you	0	” “
80373	80378	80366	80367	Mr. Grannett	213	” interposed the matron . “
80384	80385	80381	80382	Mr. Bumble	128	” “
80390	80395	80396	80396	he	2382	” rejoined the beadle , “
80418	80419	80412	80414	a obstinate pauper	2406	” “
80428	80434	80438	80438	you	128	” observed the matron emphatically . “
80471	80472	80473	80474	Mrs. Corney	211	” “
80476	80492	80473	80474	Mrs. Corney	211	” said the beadle , smiling as men smile who are conscious of superior information , “
80544	80545	80538	80538	they	457	” “
80549	80554	80538	80538	they	457	” exclaimed Mrs. Corney . “
80565	80566	80574	80574	ma’am	4840	” “
80576	80581	80574	80574	ma’am	4840	” returned Mr. Bumble , “
80641	80652	80629	80630	Mrs. Corney	211	” said the beadle , stopping to unpack his bundle , “
80723	80784	80785	80785	You	4840	” Having held the first bottle up to the light , and shaken it well to test its excellence , Mr. Bumble placed them both on top of a chest of drawers ; folded the handkerchief in which they had been wrapped ; put it carefully in his pocket ; and took up his hat , as if to go . “
80796	80801	80793	80794	Mr. Bumble	128	” said the matron . “
80807	80819	80805	80805	ma’am	4840	” replied Mr. Bumble , turning up his coat - collar , “
80828	80991	80805	80805	ma’am	4840	” The matron looked , from the little kettle , to the beadle , who was moving towards the door ; and as the beadle coughed , preparatory to bidding her good - night , bashfully inquired whether — whether he would n’t take a cup of tea ? Mr. Bumble instantaneously turned back his collar again ; laid his hat and stick upon a chair ; and drew another chair up to the table . As he slowly seated himself , he looked at the lady . She fixed her eyes upon the little teapot . Mr. Bumble coughed again , and slightly smiled . Mrs. Corney rose to get another cup and saucer from the closet . As she sat down , her eyes once again encountered those of the gallant beadle ; she coloured , and applied herself to the task of making his tea . Again Mr. Bumble coughed — louder this time than he had coughed yet . “
80997	81009	80994	80995	Mr. Bumble	128	” inquired the matron , taking up the sugar - basin . “
81017	81132	81015	81015	ma’am	4840	” replied Mr. Bumble . He fixed his eyes on Mrs. Corney as he said this ; and if ever a beadle looked tender , Mr. Bumble was that beadle at that moment . The tea was made , and handed in silence . Mr. Bumble , having spread a handkerchief over his knees to prevent the crumbs from sullying the splendour of his shorts , began to eat and drink ; varying these amusements , occasionally , by fetching a deep sigh ; which , however , had no injurious effect upon his appetite , but , on the contrary , rather seemed to facilitate his operations in the tea and toast department . “
81143	81166	81140	81140	I	0	” said Mr. Bumble , glancing at one who , in the centre of her family , was basking before the fire ; “
81174	81175	81171	81171	I	0	” “
81191	81196	81186	81186	you	128	” replied the matron . “
81223	81224	81216	81216	they	2423	” “
81231	81238	81216	81216	they	2423	” replied Mr. Bumble , approvingly ; “
81243	81244	81229	81229	ma’am	4840	” “
81249	81256	81229	81229	ma’am	4840	” rejoined the matron with enthusiasm ; “
81275	81276	81277	81278	Mrs. Corney	211	” “
81282	81297	81277	81278	Mrs. Corney	211	” said Mr. Bumble , slowly , and marking the time with his teaspoon , “
81338	81339	81336	81336	ma’am	4840	” “
81345	81350	81342	81343	Mr. Bumble	128	” remonstrated Mrs. Corney . “
81361	81382	81359	81359	ma’am	4840	” said Mr. Bumble , slowly flourishing the teaspoon with a kind of amorous dignity which made him doubly impressive ; “
81392	81393	81387	81387	myself	0	” “
81401	81419	81397	81399	a cruel man	2432	” said the matron vivaciously , as she held out her hand for the beadle ’s cup ; “
81429	81430	81421	81426	a very hard - hearted man	2433	” “
81437	81442	81421	81426	a very hard - hearted man	2433	” said Mr. Bumble . “
81445	81858	81863	81864	Mrs. Corney	211	” Mr. Bumble resigned his cup without another word ; squeezed Mrs. Corney ’s little finger as she took it ; and inflicting two open - handed slaps upon his laced waistcoat , gave a mighty sigh , and hitched his chair a very little morsel farther from the fire . It was a round table ; and as Mrs. Corney and Mr. Bumble had been sitting opposite each other , with no great space between them , and fronting the fire , it will be seen that Mr. Bumble , in receding from the fire , and still keeping at the table , increased the distance between himself and Mrs. Corney ; which proceeding , some prudent readers will doubtless be disposed to admire , and to consider an act of great heroism on Mr. Bumble ’s part : he being in some sort tempted by time , place , and opportunity , to give utterance to certain soft nothings , which however well they may become the lips of the light and thoughtless , do seem immeasurably beneath the dignity of judges of the land , members of parliament , ministers of state , lord mayors , and other great public functionaries , but more particularly beneath the stateliness and gravity of a beadle : who ( as is well known ) should be the sternest and most inflexible among them all . Whatever were Mr. Bumble ’s intentions , however ( and no doubt they were of the best ): it unfortunately happened , as has been twice before remarked , that the table was a round one ; consequently Mr. Bumble , moving his chair by little and little , soon began to diminish the distance between himself and the matron ; and , continuing to travel round the outer edge of the circle , brought his chair , in time , close to that in which the matron was seated . Indeed , the two chairs touched ; and when they did so , Mr. Bumble stopped . Now , if the matron had moved her chair to the right , she would have been scorched by the fire ; and if to the left , she must have fallen into Mr. Bumble ’s arms ; so ( being a discreet matron , and no doubt foreseeing these consequences at a glance ) she remained where she was , and handed Mr. Bumble another cup of tea . “
81866	81884	81893	81894	Mrs. Corney	211	” said Mr. Bumble , stirring his tea , and looking up into the matron ’s face ; “
81896	81897	81898	81898	Dear	4730	” “
81901	81906	81898	81898	Dear	4730	” exclaimed the matron , “
81928	81962	81925	81926	Mr. Bumble	128	” The beadle drank his tea to the last drop ; finished a piece of toast ; whisked the crumbs off his knees ; wiped his lips ; and deliberately kissed the matron . “
81966	81990	81991	81992	Mr. Bumble	128	” cried that discreet lady in a whisper ; for the fright was so great , that she had quite lost her voice , “
81998	82132	81994	81994	I	0	” Mr. Bumble made no reply ; but in a slow and dignified manner , put his arm round the matron ’s waist . As the lady had stated her intention of screaming , of course she would have screamed at this additional boldness , but that the exertion was rendered unnecessary by a hasty knocking at the door : which was no sooner heard , than Mr. Bumble darted , with much agility , to the wine bottles , and began dusting them with great violence : while the matron sharply demanded who was there . It is worthy of remark , as a curious physical instance of the efficacy of a sudden surprise in counteracting the effects of extreme fear , that her voice had quite recovered all its official asperity . “
82139	82158	82134	82134	you	128	” said a withered old female pauper , hideously ugly : putting her head in at the door , “
82167	82168	82159	82160	Old Sally	214	” “
82177	82183	82184	82184	I	0	” angrily demanded the matron . “
82194	82195	82192	82192	I	0	” “
82202	82208	82209	82209	nobody	316	” replied the old woman , “
82300	82859	82289	82289	She	214	” At this intelligence , the worthy Mrs. Corney muttered a variety of invectives against old women who could n’t even die without purposely annoying their betters ; and , muffling herself in a thick shawl which she hastily caught up , briefly requested Mr. Bumble to stay till she came back , lest anything particular should occur . Bidding the messenger walk fast , and not be all night hobbling up the stairs , she followed her from the room with a very ill grace , scolding all the way . Mr. Bumble ’s conduct on being left to himself , was rather inexplicable . He opened the closet , counted the teaspoons , weighed the sugar - tongs , closely inspected a silver milk - pot to ascertain that it was of the genuine metal , and , having satisfied his curiosity on these points , put on his cocked hat corner - wise , and danced with much gravity four distinct times round the table . Having gone through this very extraordinary performance , he took off the cocked hat again , and , spreading himself before the fire with his back towards it , seemed to be mentally engaged in taking an exact inventory of the furniture . CHAPTER XXIV . TREATS ON A VERY POOR SUBJECT , BUT IS A SHORT ONE , AND MAY BE FOUND OF IMPORTANCE IN THIS HISTORY It was no unfit messenger of death , who had disturbed the quiet of the matron ’s room . Her body was bent by age ; her limbs trembled with palsy ; her face , distorted into a mumbling leer , resembled more the grotesque shaping of some wild pencil , than the work of Nature ’s hand . Alas ! How few of Nature ’s faces are left alone to gladden us with their beauty ! The cares , and sorrows , and hungerings , of the world , change them as they change hearts ; and it is only when those passions sleep , and have lost their hold for ever , that the troubled clouds pass off , and leave Heaven ’s surface clear . It is a common thing for the countenances of the dead , even in that fixed and rigid state , to subside into the long - forgotten expression of sleeping infancy , and settle into the very look of early life ; so calm , so peaceful , do they grow again , that those who knew them in their happy childhood , kneel by the coffin ’s side in awe , and see the Angel even upon earth . The old crone tottered along the passages , and up the stairs , muttering some indistinct answers to the chidings of her companion ; being at length compelled to pause for breath , she gave the light into her hand , and remained behind to follow as she might : while the more nimble superior made her way to the room where the sick woman lay . It was a bare garret - room , with a dim light burning at the farther end . There was another old woman watching by the bed ; the parish apothecary ’s apprentice was standing by the fire , making a toothpick out of a quill . “
82866	82877	82863	82864	Mrs. Corney	211	” said this young gentleman , as the matron entered . “
82885	82904	82883	82883	sir	4543	” replied the mistress , in her most civil tones , and dropping a curtsey as she spoke . “
82915	82936	82883	82883	sir	4543	” said the apothecary ’s deputy , breaking a lump on the top of the fire with the rusty poker ; “
82951	82952	82883	82883	sir	4543	” “
82962	82967	82960	82960	sir	4543	” returned the matron . “
82989	83003	82970	82970	they	2447	” The conversation was here interrupted by a moan from the sick woman . “
83006	83029	82970	82970	they	2447	” said the young man , turning his face towards the bed , as if he had previously quite forgotten the patient , “
83039	83040	83036	83037	Mrs. Corney	211	” “
83049	83054	83047	83047	sir	4543	” asked the matron . “
83068	83082	83063	83063	I	0	” said the apothecary ’s apprentice , intent upon the toothpick ’s point . “
83101	83118	83095	83095	she	2450	” The attendant stooped over the bed , to ascertain ; and nodded in the affirmative . “
83137	83143	83095	83095	she	2450	” said the young man . “
83158	83352	83151	83151	She	2450	” The attendant did as she was told : shaking her head meanwhile , to intimate that the woman would not die so easily ; having done so , she resumed her seat by the side of the other nurse , who had by this time returned . The mistress , with an expression of impatience , wrapped herself in her shawl , and sat at the foot of the bed . The apothecary ’s apprentice , having completed the manufacture of the toothpick , planted himself in front of the fire and made good use of it for ten minutes or so : when apparently growing rather dull , he wished Mrs. Corney joy of her job , and took himself off on tiptoe . When they had sat in silence for some time , the two old women rose from the bed , and crouching over the fire , held out their withered hands to catch the heat . The flame threw a ghastly light on their shrivelled faces , and made their ugliness appear terrible , as , in this position , they began to converse in a low voice . “
83367	83372	83354	83354	she	2452	” inquired the messenger . “
83377	83382	83383	83383	She	2452	” replied the other . “
83443	83444	83446	83446	she	2452	” “
83459	83464	83446	83446	she	2452	” demanded the first . “
83472	83477	83465	83465	I	0	” rejoined the other . “
83520	83546	83547	83547	I	0	” Looking cautiously round , to ascertain that they were not overheard , the two hags cowered nearer to the fire , and chuckled heartily . “
83552	83558	83547	83547	I	0	” said the first speaker , “
83575	83576	83580	83580	she	2452	” “
83583	83588	83589	83589	she	2452	” rejoined the other ; “
83640	83741	83631	83631	I	0	” Stretching forth her trembling fingers as she spoke , the old creature shook them exultingly before her face , and fumbling in her pocket , brought out an old time - discoloured tin snuff - box , from which she shook a few grains into the outstretched palm of her companion , and a few more into her own . While they were thus employed , the matron , who had been impatiently watching until the dying woman should awaken from her stupor , joined them by the fire , and sharply asked how long she was to wait ? “
83747	83759	83745	83745	mistress	2437	” replied the second woman , looking up into her face . “
83785	83786	83775	83775	He	2459	” “
83795	83801	83802	83802	You	2437	” said the matron sternly . “
83817	83818	83810	83810	she	2459	” “
83821	83827	83810	83810	she	2459	” answered the first woman . “
83834	83840	83802	83802	You	2437	” added the second one ; “
83864	83865	83855	83855	mistress	2437	” “
83870	83877	83878	83878	she	2459	” said the matron , snappishly , “
83957	83999	83953	83953	I	0	” She was bouncing away , when a cry from the two women , who had turned towards the bed , caused her to look round . The patient had raised herself upright , and was stretching her arms towards them . “
84004	84013	83953	83953	I	0	” she cried , in a hollow voice . “
84018	84029	83953	83953	I	0	” said one of the women , stooping over her . “
84036	84037	84038	84038	I	0	” “
84046	84053	84054	84054	I	0	” said the woman , struggling . “
84073	84118	84067	84067	me	0	” She clutched the matron by the arm , and forcing her into a chair by the bedside , was about to speak , when looking round , she caught sight of the two old women bending forward in the attitude of eager listeners . “
84123	84130	84067	84067	me	0	” said the woman , drowsily ; “
84137	84279	84067	84067	me	0	” The two old crones , chiming in together , began pouring out many piteous lamentations that the poor dear was too far gone to know her best friends ; and were uttering sundry protestations that they would never leave her , when the superior pushed them from the room , closed the door , and returned to the bedside . On being excluded , the old ladies changed their tone , and cried through the keyhole that old Sally was drunk ; which , indeed , was not unlikely ; since , in addition to a moderate dose of opium prescribed by the apothecary , she was labouring under the effects of a final taste of gin - and - water which had been privily administered , in the openness of their hearts , by the worthy old ladies themselves . “
84285	84306	84283	84283	me	0	” said the dying woman aloud , as if making a great effort to revive one latent spark of energy . “
84369	84370	84410	84410	I	0	” “
84376	84382	84410	84410	I	0	” said the impatient auditor ; “
84387	84388	84385	84385	her	2469	” “
84391	84404	84385	84385	her	2469	” murmured the sick woman , relapsing into her former drowsy state , “
84413	84431	84385	84385	her	2469	” she cried , jumping fiercely up : her face flushed , and her eyes starting from her head—“I
84457	84458	84453	84453	I	0	” “
84467	84483	84444	84444	I	0	” cried the matron , with a gesture as if she would call for help . “
84488	84502	84540	84540	I	0	” replied the woman , laying her hand over the other ’s mouth . “
84554	84555	84588	84589	the mother	2473	” “
84558	84573	84588	84589	the mother	2473	” echoed the matron , bending eagerly over the woman as she fell back . “
84595	84596	84597	84597	She	2473	” “
84605	84613	84597	84597	She	2473	” replied the woman with a groan , “
84668	84669	84662	84662	they	2476	” “
84673	84678	84662	84662	they	2476	” asked the other . “
84681	84682	84662	84662	they	2476	” “
84691	84705	84683	84684	The boy	423	” said the woman , rambling on , and not heeding the question , “
84754	84755	84752	84752	I	0	” “
84760	84783	84752	84752	I	0	” replied the matron , inclining her head to catch the words , as they came more faintly from the dying woman . “
84794	84795	84796	84797	The mother	2473	” “
84799	84812	84813	84814	the mother	2473	” said the woman , making a more violent effort than before ; “
84912	84913	84869	84869	she	2473	” “
84919	84924	84869	84869	she	2473	” demanded the matron . “
84932	84939	84925	84925	They	2492	” replied the woman , feebly . “
84946	84947	84925	84925	They	2492	” “
84954	85016	84925	84925	They	2492	” cried the other . She was bending eagerly over the woman to hear her reply ; but drew back , instinctively , as she once again rose , slowly and stiffly , into a sitting posture ; then , clutching the coverlid with both hands , muttered some indistinct sounds in her throat , and fell lifeless on the bed . “
85020	85038	84925	84925	They	2492	” said one of the old women , hurrying in as soon as the door was opened . “
85047	85485	84925	84925	They	2492	” rejoined the matron , walking carelessly away . The two crones , to all appearance , too busily occupied in the preparations for their dreadful duties to make any reply , were left alone , hovering about the body . CHAPTER XXV . WHEREIN THIS HISTORY REVERTS TO MR . FAGIN AND COMPANY While these things were passing in the country workhouse , Mr. Fagin sat in the old den — the same from which Oliver had been removed by the girl — brooding over a dull , smoky fire . He held a pair of bellows upon his knee , with which he had apparently been endeavouring to rouse it into more cheerful action ; but he had fallen into deep thought ; and with his arms folded on them , and his chin resting on his thumbs , fixed his eyes , abstractedly , on the rusty bars . At a table behind him sat the Artful Dodger , Master Charles Bates , and Mr. Chitling : all intent upon a game of whist ; the Artful taking dummy against Master Bates and Mr. Chitling . The countenance of the first - named gentleman , peculiarly intelligent at all times , acquired great additional interest from his close observance of the game , and his attentive perusal of Mr. Chitling ’s hand ; upon which , from time to time , as occasion served , he bestowed a variety of earnest glances : wisely regulating his own play by the result of his observations upon his neighbour ’s cards . It being a cold night , the Dodger wore his hat , as , indeed , was often his custom within doors . He also sustained a clay pipe between his teeth , which he only removed for a brief space when he deemed it necessary to apply for refreshment to a quart pot upon the table , which stood ready filled with gin - and - water for the accommodation of the company . Master Bates was also attentive to the play ; but being of a more excitable nature than his accomplished friend , it was observable that he more frequently applied himself to the gin - and - water , and moreover indulged in many jests and irrelevant remarks , all highly unbecoming a scientific rubber . Indeed , the Artful , presuming upon their close attachment , more than once took occasion to reason gravely with his companion upon these improprieties ; all of which remonstrances , Master Bates received in extremely good part ; merely requesting his friend to be “
85488	85591	84925	84925	They	2492	” or to insert his head in a sack , or replying with some other neatly - turned witticism of a similar kind , the happy application of which , excited considerable admiration in the mind of Mr. Chitling . It was remarkable that the latter gentleman and his partner invariably lost ; and that the circumstance , so far from angering Master Bates , appeared to afford him the highest amusement , inasmuch as he laughed most uproariously at the end of every deal , and protested that he had never seen such a jolly game in all his born days . “
85600	85625	85626	85626	I	0	” said Mr. Chitling , with a very long face , as he drew half - a - crown from his waistcoat - pocket . “
85658	85704	85650	85650	I	0	” Either the matter or the manner of this remark , which was made very ruefully , delighted Charley Bates so much , that his consequent shout of laughter roused the Jew from his reverie , and induced him to inquire what was the matter . “
85709	85713	85714	85714	I	0	” cried Charley . “
85742	85743	85731	85731	I	0	” “
85748	85771	85731	85731	I	0	” said the Jew , with a grin , which sufficiently demonstrated that he was at no loss to understand the reason . “
85782	85783	85776	85776	Tom	199	” “
85797	85802	85795	85795	Fagin	161	” replied Mr. Chitling ; “
85827	85828	85825	85825	him	162	” “
85836	85841	85825	85825	him	162	” replied the Jew , “
85858	85859	85855	85856	the Dodger	1138	” “
85862	85867	85855	85856	the Dodger	1138	” said Charley Bates ; “
85903	85990	85994	85994	you	4649	” Mr. Dawkins received these handsome compliments with much philosophy , and offered to cut any gentleman in company , for the first picture - card , at a shilling at a time . Nobody accepting the challenge , and his pipe being by this time smoked out , he proceeded to amuse himself by sketching a ground - plan of Newgate on the table with the piece of chalk which had served him in lieu of counters ; whistling , meantime , with peculiar shrillness . “
85999	86019	85997	85997	Tommy	199	” said the Dodger , stopping short when there had been a long silence ; and addressing Mr. Chitling . “
86031	86032	86022	86022	you	4649	” “
86041	86054	86035	86035	I	0	” replied the Jew , looking round as he plied the bellows . “
86087	86088	86117	86117	you	4649	” “
86095	86113	86117	86117	you	4649	” replied the Dodger , stopping the subject of discourse as Mr. Chitling was about to reply . “
86123	86124	86117	86117	you	4649	” “
86131	86140	86117	86117	you	4649	” replied Master Bates , with a grin , “
86187	86262	86265	86265	him	1138	” Thoroughly overpowered with the notion of Mr. Chitling being the victim of the tender passion , Master Bates threw himself back in his chair with such violence , that he lost his balance , and pitched over upon the floor ; where ( the accident abating nothing of his merriment ) he lay at full length until his laugh was over , when he resumed his former position , and began another laugh . “
86270	86294	86265	86265	him	1138	” said the Jew , winking at Mr. Dawkins , and giving Master Bates a reproving tap with the nozzle of the bellows . “
86313	86314	86311	86311	her	166	” “
86323	86334	86321	86321	Fagin	161	” replied Mr. Chitling , very red in the face , “
86346	86347	86316	86316	I	0	” “
86353	86358	86316	86316	I	0	” replied the Jew ; “
86397	86398	86384	86384	she	166	” “
86410	86415	86406	86406	she	166	” replied Mr. Chitling ; “
86490	86491	86488	86488	Fagin	161	” “
86501	86506	86488	86488	Fagin	161	” replied the Jew . “
86519	86531	86517	86517	you	199	” asked the Dodger , winking upon Charley and the Jew , “
86538	86539	86540	86540	I	0	” “
86549	86555	86545	86545	I	0	” replied Tom , angrily . “
86580	86581	86578	86578	Fagin	161	” “
86587	86592	86593	86595	not a soul	1089	” replied the Jew ; “
86621	86622	86623	86623	I	0	” “
86643	86653	86641	86641	Fagin	161	” angrily pursued the poor half - witted dupe . “
86669	86670	86667	86667	Fagin	161	” “
86680	86685	86667	86667	Fagin	161	” replied the Jew . “
86698	86710	86694	86694	I	0	” demanded Tom , pouring question upon question with great volubility . “
86719	86724	86694	86694	I	0	” replied the Jew ; “
86742	86743	86745	86745	I	0	” “
86748	86755	86745	86745	I	0	” rejoined Tom , looking round ; “
86774	86926	86772	86772	Fagin	161	” The Jew , perceiving that Mr. Chitling was considerably roused , hastened to assure him that nobody was laughing ; and to prove the gravity of the company , appealed to Master Bates , the principal offender . But , unfortunately , Charley , in opening his mouth to reply that he was never more serious in his life , was unable to prevent the escape of such a violent roar , that the abused Mr. Chitling , without any preliminary ceremonies , rushed across the room and aimed a blow at the offender ; who , being skilful in evading pursuit , ducked to avoid it , and chose his time so well that it lighted on the chest of the merry old gentleman , and caused him to stagger to the wall , where he stood panting for breath , while Mr. Chitling looked on in intense dismay . “
86929	86937	86938	86938	I	0	” cried the Dodger at this moment , “
86943	86985	86938	86938	I	0	” Catching up the light , he crept softly upstairs . The bell was rung again , with some impatience , while the party were in darkness . After a short pause , the Dodger reappeared , and whispered Fagin mysteriously . “
86988	86993	86938	86938	I	0	” cried the Jew , “
86996	87100	87103	87103	he	2518	” The Dodger nodded in the affirmative , and , shading the flame of the candle with his hand , gave Charley Bates a private intimation , in dumb show , that he had better not be funny just then . Having performed this friendly office , he fixed his eyes on the Jew ’s face , and awaited his directions . The old man bit his yellow fingers , and meditated for some seconds ; his face working with agitation the while , as if he dreaded something , and feared to know the worst . At length he raised his head . “
87105	87129	87103	87103	he	2518	” he asked . The Dodger pointed to the floor above , and made a gesture , as if to leave the room . “
87132	87142	87103	87103	he	2518	” said the Jew , answering the mute inquiry ; “
87161	87258	87103	87103	he	2518	” This brief direction to Charley Bates , and his recent antagonist , was softly and immediately obeyed . There was no sound of their whereabout , when the Dodger descended the stairs , bearing the light in his hand , and followed by a man in a coarse smock - frock ; who , after casting a hurried glance round the room , pulled off a large wrapper which had concealed the lower portion of his face , and disclosed : all haggard , unwashed , and unshorn : the features of flash Toby Crackit . “
87265	87275	87261	87261	you	164	” said this worthy , nodding to the Jew . “
87319	87354	87309	87316	a fine young cracksman afore the old file	2520	” With these words he pulled up the smock - frock ; and , winding it round his middle , drew a chair to the fire , and placed his feet upon the hob . “
87360	87371	87358	87358	Faguey	221	” he said , pointing disconsolately to his top boots ; “
87445	87654	87659	87659	Faguey	221	” The Jew motioned to the Dodger to place what eatables there were , upon the table ; and , seating himself opposite the housebreaker , waited his leisure . To judge from appearances , Toby was by no means in a hurry to open the conversation . At first , the Jew contented himself with patiently watching his countenance , as if to gain from its expression some clue to the intelligence he brought ; but in vain . He looked tired and worn , but there was the same complacent repose upon his features that they always wore : and through dirt , and beard , and whisker , there still shone , unimpaired , the self - satisfied smirk of flash Toby Crackit . Then the Jew , in an agony of impatience , watched every morsel he put into his mouth ; pacing up and down the room , meanwhile , in irrepressible excitement . It was all of no use . Toby continued to eat with the utmost outward indifference , until he could eat no more ; then , ordering the Dodger out , he closed the door , mixed a glass of spirits and water , and composed himself for talking . “
87661	87665	87659	87659	Faguey	221	” said Toby . “
87670	87728	87733	87733	Faguey	221	” interposed the Jew , drawing up his chair . Mr. Crackit stopped to take a draught of spirits and water , and to declare that the gin was excellent ; then placing his feet against the low mantelpiece , so as to bring his boots to about the level of his eye , he quietly resumed . “
87735	87740	87733	87733	Faguey	221	” said the housebreaker , “
87745	87746	87743	87743	Bill	149	” “
87749	87759	87743	87743	Bill	149	” screamed the Jew , starting from his seat . “
87769	87776	87762	87762	you	221	” began Toby , turning pale . “
87779	87790	87762	87762	you	221	” cried the Jew , stamping furiously on the ground . “
87821	87822	87762	87762	you	221	” “
87827	87832	87833	87833	I	0	” said Toby faintly . “
87837	87853	87833	87833	I	0	” replied the Jew , tearing a newspaper from his pocket and pointing to it . “
87857	87858	87859	87859	They	2522	” “
87909	87910	87911	87912	The boy	423	” “
87914	87915	87916	87916	Bill	149	” “
87990	88559	87985	87985	I	0	” The Jew stopped to hear no more ; but uttering a loud yell , and twining his hands in his hair , rushed from the room , and from the house . CHAPTER XXVI . IN WHICH A MYSTERIOUS CHARACTER APPEARS UPON THE SCENE ; AND MANY THINGS , INSEPARABLE FROM THIS HISTORY , ARE DONE AND PERFORMED The old man had gained the street corner , before he began to recover the effect of Toby Crackit ’s intelligence . He had relaxed nothing of his unusual speed ; but was still pressing onward , in the same wild and disordered manner , when the sudden dashing past of a carriage : and a boisterous cry from the foot passengers , who saw his danger : drove him back upon the pavement . Avoiding , as much as was possible , all the main streets , and skulking only through the by - ways and alleys , he at length emerged on Snow Hill . Here he walked even faster than before ; nor did he linger until he had again turned into a court ; when , as if conscious that he was now in his proper element , he fell into his usual shuffling pace , and seemed to breathe more freely . Near to the spot on which Snow Hill and Holborn Hill meet , opens , upon the right hand as you come out of the City , a narrow and dismal alley , leading to Saffron Hill . In its filthy shops are exposed for sale huge bunches of second - hand silk handkerchiefs , of all sizes and patterns ; for here reside the traders who purchase them from pick - pockets . Hundreds of these handkerchiefs hang dangling from pegs outside the windows or flaunting from the door - posts ; and the shelves , within , are piled with them . Confined as the limits of Field Lane are , it has its barber , its coffee - shop , its beer - shop , and its fried - fish warehouse . It is a commercial colony of itself : the emporium of petty larceny : visited at early morning , and setting - in of dusk , by silent merchants , who traffic in dark back - parlours , and who go as strangely as they come . Here , the clothesman , the shoe - vamper , and the rag - merchant , display their goods , as sign - boards to the petty thief ; here , stores of old iron and bones , and heaps of mildewy fragments of woollen - stuff and linen , rust and rot in the grimy cellars . It was into this place that the Jew turned . He was well known to the sallow denizens of the lane ; for such of them as were on the look - out to buy or sell , nodded , familiarly , as he passed along . He replied to their salutations in the same way ; but bestowed no closer recognition until he reached the further end of the alley ; when he stopped , to address a salesman of small stature , who had squeezed as much of his person into a child ’s chair as the chair would hold , and was smoking a pipe at his warehouse door . “
88575	88592	88567	88568	Mr. Fagin	161	” said this respectable trader , in acknowledgment of the Jew ’s inquiry after his health . “
88603	88619	88601	88601	Lively	224	” said Fagin , elevating his eyebrows , and crossing his hands upon his shoulders . “
88635	88640	88622	88622	I	0	” replied the trader ; “
88655	88680	88650	88650	you	2535	” Fagin nodded in the affirmative . Pointing in the direction of Saffron Hill , he inquired whether any one was up yonder tonight . “
88685	88694	88650	88650	you	2535	” inquired the man . The Jew nodded . “
88699	88706	88696	88696	me	0	” pursued the merchant , reflecting . “
88733	88734	88735	88735	Sikes	149	” “
88742	88752	88735	88735	Sikes	149	” inquired the Jew , with a disappointed countenance . “
88763	88778	88759	88760	the lawyers	2539	” replied the little man , shaking his head , and looking amazingly sly . “
88788	88789	88780	88780	you	0	” “
88793	88801	88780	88780	you	0	” said the Jew , turning away . “
88812	88822	88803	88803	you	0	” cried the little man , calling after him . “
88838	89675	88825	88825	I	0	” But as the Jew , looking back , waved his hand to intimate that he preferred being alone ; and , moreover , as the little man could not very easily disengage himself from the chair ; the sign of the Cripples was , for a time , bereft of the advantage of Mr. Lively ’s presence . By the time he had got upon his legs , the Jew had disappeared ; so Mr. Lively , after ineffectually standing on tiptoe , in the hope of catching sight of him , again forced himself into the little chair , and , exchanging a shake of the head with a lady in the opposite shop , in which doubt and mistrust were plainly mingled , resumed his pipe with a grave demeanour . The Three Cripples , or rather the Cripples ; which was the sign by which the establishment was familiarly known to its patrons : was the public - house in which Mr. Sikes and his dog have already figured . Merely making a sign to a man at the bar , Fagin walked straight upstairs , and opening the door of a room , and softly insinuating himself into the chamber , looked anxiously about : shading his eyes with his hand , as if in search of some particular person . The room was illuminated by two gas - lights ; the glare of which was prevented by the barred shutters , and closely - drawn curtains of faded red , from being visible outside . The ceiling was blackened , to prevent its colour from being injured by the flaring of the lamps ; and the place was so full of dense tobacco smoke , that at first it was scarcely possible to discern anything more . By degrees , however , as some of it cleared away through the open door , an assemblage of heads , as confused as the noises that greeted the ear , might be made out ; and as the eye grew more accustomed to the scene , the spectator gradually became aware of the presence of a numerous company , male and female , crowded round a long table : at the upper end of which , sat a chairman with a hammer of office in his hand ; while a professional gentleman with a bluish nose , and his face tied up for the benefit of a toothache , presided at a jingling piano in a remote corner . As Fagin stepped softly in , the professional gentleman , running over the keys by way of prelude , occasioned a general cry of order for a song ; which having subsided , a young lady proceeded to entertain the company with a ballad in four verses , between each of which the accompanyist played the melody all through , as loud as he could . When this was over , the chairman gave a sentiment , after which , the professional gentleman on the chairman ’s right and left volunteered a duet , and sang it , with great applause . It was curious to observe some faces which stood out prominently from among the group . There was the chairman himself , ( the landlord of the house , ) a coarse , rough , heavy built fellow , who , while the songs were proceeding , rolled his eyes hither and thither , and , seeming to give himself up to joviality , had an eye for everything that was done , and an ear for everything that was said — and sharp ones , too . Near him were the singers : receiving , with professional indifference , the compliments of the company , and applying themselves , in turn , to a dozen proffered glasses of spirits and water , tendered by their more boisterous admirers ; whose countenances , expressive of almost every vice in almost every grade , irresistibly attracted the attention , by their very repulsiveness . Cunning , ferocity , and drunkeness in all its stages , were there , in their strongest aspect ; and women : some with the last lingering tinge of their early freshness almost fading as you looked : others with every mark and stamp of their sex utterly beaten out , and presenting but one loathsome blank of profligacy and crime ; some mere girls , others but young women , and none past the prime of life ; formed the darkest and saddest portion of this dreary picture . Fagin , troubled by no grave emotions , looked eagerly from face to face while these proceedings were in progress ; but apparently without meeting that of which he was in search . Succeeding , at length , in catching the eye of the man who occupied the chair , he beckoned to him slightly , and left the room , as quietly as he had entered it . “
89686	89700	89683	89684	Mr. Fagin	161	” inquired the man , as he followed him out to the landing . “
89717	89731	89707	89707	They	2541	” The Jew shook his head impatiently , and said in a whisper , “
89738	89739	89734	89734	he	2544	” “
89742	89747	89734	89734	he	2544	” replied the man . “
89754	89758	89752	89752	Barney	187	” inquired Fagin . “
89761	89774	89775	89775	He	2544	” replied the landlord of the Cripples ; for it was he . “
89846	89847	89829	89829	I	0	” “
89856	89871	89872	89872	Monks	226	” asked the Jew , laying the same emphasis on the pronoun as before . “
89878	89885	89872	89872	Monks	226	” inquired the landlord , hesitating . “
89888	89893	89872	89872	Monks	226	” said the Jew . “
89896	89897	89898	89898	Certain	2547	” “
89900	89913	89898	89898	Certain	2547	” replied the man , drawing a gold watch from his fob ; “
89932	89933	89928	89928	he	2544	” “
89938	89968	89970	89970	him	2544	” said the Jew , hastily ; as though , however desirous he might be to see the person in question , he was nevertheless relieved by his absence . “
90004	90005	89970	89970	him	2544	” “
90008	90013	89970	89970	him	2544	” said the man . “
90017	90018	89970	89970	him	2544	” “
90024	90033	90034	90034	I	0	” said the Jew , descending the stairs . “
90037	90054	90034	90034	I	0	” said the other , looking over the rails , and speaking in a hoarse whisper ; “
90082	90083	90065	90065	I	0	” “
90095	90103	90090	90091	Phil Barker	227	” said the Jew , looking up . “
90147	90229	90253	90253	I	0	” The landlord reciprocated the old man ’s laugh ; and returned to his guests . The Jew was no sooner alone , than his countenance resumed its former expression of anxiety and thought . After a brief reflection , he called a hack - cabriolet , and bade the man drive towards Bethnal Green . He dismissed him within some quarter of a mile of Mr. Sikes ’s residence , and performed the short remainder of the distance on foot . “
90232	90244	90253	90253	I	0	” muttered the Jew , as he knocked at the door , “
90269	90313	90253	90253	I	0	” She was in her room , the woman said . Fagin crept softly upstairs , and entered it without any previous ceremony . The girl was alone ; lying with her head upon the table , and her hair straggling over it . “
90319	90326	90329	90329	she	2557	” thought the Jew , cooly , “
90334	90513	90329	90329	she	2557	” The old man turned to close the door , as he made this reflection ; the noise thus occasioned , roused the girl . She eyed his crafty face narrowly , as she inquired to his recital of Toby Crackit ’s story . When it was concluded , she sank into her former attitude , but spoke not a word . She pushed the candle impatiently away ; and once or twice as she feverishly changed her position , shuffled her feet upon the ground ; but this was all . During the silence , the Jew looked restlessly about the room , as if to assure himself that there were no appearances of Sikes having covertly returned . Apparently satisfied with his inspection , he coughed twice or thrice , and made as many efforts to open a conversation ; but the girl heeded him no more than if he had been made of stone . At length he made another attempt ; and rubbing his hands together , said , in his most conciliatory tone , “
90526	90557	90517	90517	you	2558	” The girl moaned out some half intelligible reply , that she could not tell ; and seemed , from the smothered noise that escaped her , to be crying . “
90564	90580	90559	90560	the boy	423	” said the Jew , straining his eyes to catch a glimpse of her face . “
90595	90596	90597	90598	The child	306	” “
90600	90609	90597	90598	The child	306	” said the girl , suddenly looking up , “
90647	90648	90630	90630	I	0	” “
90651	90659	90630	90630	I	0	” cried the Jew , in amazement . “
90665	90674	90662	90662	I	0	” returned the girl , meeting his gaze . “
90720	90721	90709	90709	him	306	” “
90724	90731	90709	90709	him	306	” said the Jew , scornfully . “
90736	90737	90709	90709	him	306	” “
90741	90747	90739	90739	I	0	” cried the girl bitterly . “
90786	90787	90769	90769	you	0	” “
90790	90797	90769	90769	you	0	” rejoined the Jew , furiously . “
90802	90803	90846	90846	I	0	” “
90809	90818	90846	90846	I	0	” responded the girl , with a laugh . “
90822	90845	90846	90846	I	0	” exclaimed the Jew , exasperated beyond all bounds by his companion ’s unexpected obstinacy , and the vexation of the night , “
90951	90952	90926	90927	Jack Ketch	228	” “
90958	90964	90926	90927	Jack Ketch	228	” cried the girl involuntarily . “
90969	90977	90926	90927	Jack Ketch	228	” pursued Fagin , mad with rage . “
91044	91160	91161	91161	Nancy	167	” Panting for breath , the old man stammered for a word ; and in that instant checked the torrent of his wrath , and changed his whole demeanour . A moment before , his clenched hands had grasped the air ; his eyes had dilated ; and his face grown livid with passion ; but now , he shrunk into a chair , and , cowering together , trembled with the apprehension of having himself disclosed some hidden villainy . After a short silence , he ventured to look round at his companion . He appeared somewhat reassured , on beholding her in the same listless attitude from which he had first roused her . “
91165	91175	91161	91161	Nancy	167	” croaked the Jew , in his usual voice . “
91183	91184	91177	91177	you	167	” “
91193	91203	91191	91191	Fagin	161	” replied the girl , raising her head languidly . “
91251	91252	91241	91241	he	149	” “
91260	91274	91241	91241	he	149	” said the Jew , rubbing the palms of his hands nervously together . “
91285	91291	91293	91293	I	0	” interrupted Nancy , hastily ; “
91348	91349	91339	91339	Bill	149	” “
91360	91373	91353	91353	I	0	” observed the Jew , keeping his glistening eye steadily upon her . “
91392	91396	91386	91386	you	0	” rejoined Nancy ; “
91424	91599	91419	91419	I	0	” Fagin put several other questions : all with the same drift of ascertaining whether the girl had profited by his unguarded hints ; but , she answered them so readily , and was withal so utterly unmoved by his searching looks , that his original impression of her being more than a trifle in liquor , was confirmed . Nancy , indeed , was not exempt from a failing which was very common among the Jew ’s female pupils ; and in which , in their tenderer years , they were rather encouraged than checked . Her disordered appearance , and a wholesale perfume of Geneva which pervaded the apartment , afforded strong confirmatory evidence of the justice of the Jew ’s supposition ; and when , after indulging in the temporary display of violence above described , she subsided , first into dullness , and afterwards into a compound of feelings : under the influence of which she shed tears one minute , and in the next gave utterance to various exclamations of “
91604	91869	91870	91870	Fagin	161	” and divers calculations as to what might be the amount of the odds so long as a lady or gentleman was happy , Mr. Fagin , who had had considerable experience of such matters in his time , saw , with great satisfaction , that she was very far gone indeed . Having eased his mind by this discovery ; and having accomplished his twofold object of imparting to the girl what he had , that night , heard , and of ascertaining , with his own eyes , that Sikes had not returned , Mr. Fagin again turned his face homeward : leaving his young friend asleep , with her head upon the table . It was within an hour of midnight . The weather being dark , and piercing cold , he had no great temptation to loiter . The sharp wind that scoured the streets , seemed to have cleared them of passengers , as of dust and mud , for few people were abroad , and they were to all appearance hastening fast home . It blew from the right quarter for the Jew , however , and straight before it he went : trembling , and shivering , as every fresh gust drove him rudely on his way . He had reached the corner of his own street , and was already fumbling in his pocket for the door - key , when a dark figure emerged from a projecting entrance which lay in deep shadow , and , crossing the road , glided up to him unperceived . “
91872	91881	91870	91870	Fagin	161	” whispered a voice close to his ear . “
91884	91893	91870	91870	Fagin	161	” said the Jew , turning quickly round , “
91897	91898	91870	91870	Fagin	161	” “
91901	91906	91870	91870	Fagin	161	” interrupted the stranger . “
91923	91924	91920	91920	you	161	” “
91932	91951	91920	91920	you	161	” replied the Jew , glancing uneasily at his companion , and slackening his pace as he spoke . “
91958	91959	91920	91920	you	161	” “
91965	91974	91920	91920	you	161	” said the stranger , with a sneer . “
91984	91985	91998	91998	I	0	” “
91989	91994	91998	91998	I	0	” said the Jew . “
92001	92147	91998	91998	I	0	” said the stranger , stopping short , and turning a startled look on his companion . The Jew shook his head , and was about to reply , when the stranger , interrupting him , motioned to the house , before which they had by this time arrived : remarking , that he had better say what he had got to say , under cover : for his blood was chilled with standing about so long , and the wind blew through him . Fagin looked as if he could have willingly excused himself from taking home a visitor at that unseasonable hour ; and , indeed , muttered something about having no fire ; but his companion repeating his request in a peremptory manner , he unlocked the door , and requested him to close it softly , while he got a light . “
92156	92167	91998	91998	I	0	” said the man , groping forward a few steps . “
92171	92172	91998	91998	I	0	” “
92177	92198	91998	91998	I	0	” whispered Fagin from the end of the passage . As he spoke , it closed with a loud noise . “
92205	92215	92202	92202	my	0	” said the other man , feeling his way . “
92255	92312	92242	92242	I	0	” Fagin stealthily descended the kitchen stairs . After a short absence , he returned with a lighted candle , and the intelligence that Toby Crackit was asleep in the back room below , and that the boys were in the front one . Beckoning the man to follow him , he led the way upstairs . “
92330	92344	92319	92319	we	2579	” said the Jew , throwing open a door on the first floor ; “
92374	92606	92607	92607	I	0	” With those words , the Jew , stooping down , placed the candle on an upper flight of stairs , exactly opposite to the room door . This done , he led the way into the apartment ; which was destitute of all movables save a broken arm - chair , and an old couch or sofa without covering , which stood behind the door . Upon this piece of furniture , the stranger sat himself with the air of a weary man ; and the Jew , drawing up the arm - chair opposite , they sat face to face . It was not quite dark ; the door was partially open ; and the candle outside , threw a feeble reflection on the opposite wall . They conversed for some time in whispers . Though nothing of the conversation was distinguishable beyond a few disjointed words here and there , a listener might easily have perceived that Fagin appeared to be defending himself against some remarks of the stranger ; and that the latter was in a state of considerable irritation . They might have been talking , thus , for a quarter of an hour or more , when Monks — by which name the Jew had designated the strange man several times in the course of their colloquy — said , raising his voice a little , “
92639	92640	92643	92643	him	2585	” “
92645	92654	92643	92643	him	2585	” exclaimed the Jew , shrugging his shoulders . “
92674	92680	92658	92658	you	2584	” demanded Monks , sternly . “
92727	92728	92709	92709	you	2584	” “
92739	92745	92746	92746	Mine	0	” inquired the Jew humbly . “
92748	92752	92746	92746	Mine	0	” replied Monks . “
92757	92764	92755	92755	mine	0	” said the Jew , submissively . “
92803	92804	92799	92801	my good friend	5289	” “
92808	92812	92813	92813	I	0	” demanded Monks . “
92826	92831	92813	92813	I	0	” replied the Jew ; “
92843	92844	92832	92832	he	2585	” “
92850	92855	92832	92832	he	2585	” muttered the man , “
92867	92868	92861	92862	a thief	5408	” “
92880	92893	92869	92869	I	0	” pursued the Jew , anxiously watching the countenance of his companion . “
92955	92956	92949	92949	I	0	” “
92965	92969	92949	92949	I	0	” observed Monks . “
92977	92982	92949	92949	I	0	” renewed the Jew . “
93052	93053	93045	93045	she	1840	” “
93058	93064	93055	93056	the girl	1840	” said Monks , impatiently . “
93080	93087	93067	93067	we	2592	” replied the Jew , smiling ; “
93180	93189	93153	93153	You	226	” said the Jew , drawing nearer to the other,—“it
93208	93209	93217	93217	he	2585	” “
93220	93242	93217	93217	he	2585	” interposed the other man , with a look of terror , and clasping the Jew ’s arm with trembling hands . “
93311	93312	93298	93298	you	226	” “
93315	93338	93298	93298	you	226	” cried the Jew , grasping the coward round the body , with both arms , as he sprung to his feet . “
93341	93342	93298	93298	you	226	” “
93345	93356	93298	93298	you	226	” replied the man , glaring at the opposite wall . “
93382	93439	93365	93366	a woman	4784	” The Jew released his hold , and they rushed tumultuously from the room . The candle , wasted by the draught , was standing where it had been placed . It showed them only the empty staircase , and their own white faces . They listened intently : a profound silence reigned throughout the house . “
93445	93460	93442	93442	your	226	” said the Jew , taking up the light and turning to his companion . “
93468	93474	93475	93475	It	2607	” replied Monks , trembling . “
93494	93583	93487	93487	I	0	” The Jew glanced contemptuously at the pale face of his associate , and , telling him he could follow , if he pleased , ascended the stairs . They looked into all the rooms ; they were cold , bare , and empty . They descended into the passage , and thence into the cellars below . The green damp hung upon the low walls ; the tracks of the snail and slug glistened in the light of the candle ; but all was still as death . “
93590	93602	93586	93586	you	2608	” said the Jew , when they had regained the passage . “
93629	94447	94448	94448	I	0	” As a proof of the fact , the Jew drew forth two keys from his pocket ; and explained , that when he first went downstairs , he had locked them in , to prevent any intrusion on the conference . This accumulated testimony effectually staggered Mr. Monks . His protestations had gradually become less and less vehement as they proceeded in their search without making any discovery ; and , now , he gave vent to several very grim laughs , and confessed it could only have been his excited imagination . He declined any renewal of the conversation , however , for that night : suddenly remembering that it was past one o’clock . And so the amiable couple parted . CHAPTER XXVII . ATONES FOR THE UNPOLITENESS OF A FORMER CHAPTER ; WHICH DESERTED A LADY , MOST UNCEREMONIOUSLY As it would be , by no means , seemly in a humble author to keep so mighty a personage as a beadle waiting , with his back to the fire , and the skirts of his coat gathered up under his arms , until such time as it might suit his pleasure to relieve him ; and as it would still less become his station , or his gallantry to involve in the same neglect a lady on whom that beadle had looked with an eye of tenderness and affection , and in whose ear he had whispered sweet words , which , coming from such a quarter , might well thrill the bosom of maid or matron of whatsoever degree ; the historian whose pen traces these words — trusting that he knows his place , and that he entertains a becoming reverence for those upon earth to whom high and important authority is delegated — hastens to pay them that respect which their position demands , and to treat them with all that duteous ceremony which their exalted rank , and ( by consequence ) great virtues , imperatively claim at his hands . Towards this end , indeed , he had purposed to introduce , in this place , a dissertation touching the divine right of beadles , and elucidative of the position , that a beadle can do no wrong : which could not fail to have been both pleasurable and profitable to the right - minded reader but which he is unfortunately compelled , by want of time and space , to postpone to some more convenient and fitting opportunity ; on the arrival of which , he will be prepared to show , that a beadle properly constituted : that is to say , a parochial beadle , attached to a parochial workhouse , and attending in his official capacity the parochial church : is , in right and virtue of his office , possessed of all the excellences and best qualities of humanity ; and that to none of those excellences , can mere companies ’ beadles , or court - of - law beadles , or even chapel - of - ease beadles ( save the last , and they in a very lowly and inferior degree ) , lay the remotest sustainable claim . Mr. Bumble had re - counted the teaspoons , re - weighed the sugar - tongs , made a closer inspection of the milk - pot , and ascertained to a nicety the exact condition of the furniture , down to the very horse - hair seats of the chairs ; and had repeated each process full half a dozen times ; before he began to think that it was time for Mrs. Corney to return . Thinking begets thinking ; as there were no sounds of Mrs. Corney ’s approach , it occured to Mr. Bumble that it would be an innocent and virtuous way of spending the time , if he were further to allay his curiousity by a cursory glance at the interior of Mrs. Corney ’s chest of drawers . Having listened at the keyhole , to assure himself that nobody was approaching the chamber , Mr. Bumble , beginning at the bottom , proceeded to make himself acquainted with the contents of the three long drawers : which , being filled with various garments of good fashion and texture , carefully preserved between two layers of old newspapers , speckled with dried lavender : seemed to yield him exceeding satisfaction . Arriving , in course of time , at the right - hand corner drawer ( in which was the key ) , and beholding therein a small padlocked box , which , being shaken , gave forth a pleasant sound , as of the chinking of coin , Mr. Bumble returned with a stately walk to the fireplace ; and , resuming his old attitude , said , with a grave and determined air , “
94453	94561	94448	94448	I	0	” He followed up this remarkable declaration , by shaking his head in a waggish manner for ten minutes , as though he were remonstrating with himself for being such a pleasant dog ; and then , he took a view of his legs in profile , with much seeming pleasure and interest . He was still placidly engaged in this latter survey , when Mrs. Corney , hurrying into the room , threw herself , in a breathless state , on a chair by the fireside , and covering her eyes with one hand , placed the other over her heart , and gasped for breath . “
94565	94575	94448	94448	I	0	” said Mr. Bumble , stooping over the matron , “
94598	94613	94592	94592	I	0	” Mr. Bumble , in his alarm , could not immediately think of the word “
94616	94620	94592	94592	I	0	” so he said “
94624	94625	94628	94629	Mr. Bumble	128	” “
94631	94636	94628	94629	Mr. Bumble	128	” cried the lady , “
94645	94646	94637	94637	I	0	” “
94652	94657	94637	94637	I	0	” exclaimed Mr. Bumble ; “
94667	94679	94664	94664	I	0	” said Mr. Bumble , checking himself , with native majesty , “
94686	94687	94683	94684	wicious paupers	2617	” “
94695	94702	94683	94684	wicious paupers	2617	” said the lady , shuddering . “
94714	94719	94720	94720	I	0	” rejoined Mr. Bumble . “
94726	94731	94720	94720	I	0	” whimpered the lady . “
94738	94744	94736	94736	ma’am	4840	” said Mr. Bumble soothingly . “
94751	94752	94736	94736	ma’am	4840	” “
94758	94763	94764	94764	I	0	” replied Mrs. Corney . “
94779	94844	94845	94845	I	0	” Uttering these words , the good lady pointed , distractedly , to the cupboard , and underwent a convulsion from internal spasms . Mr. Bumble rushed to the closet ; and , snatching a pint green - glass bottle from the shelf thus incoherently indicated , filled a tea - cup with its contents , and held it to the lady ’s lips . “
94850	94895	94845	94845	I	0	” said Mrs. Corney , falling back , after drinking half of it . Mr. Bumble raised his eyes piously to the ceiling in thankfulness ; and , bringing them down again to the brim of the cup , lifted it to his nose . “
94898	94917	94845	94845	I	0	” exclaimed Mrs. Corney , in a faint voice , smiling gently on the beadle as she spoke . “
94933	94959	94976	94976	ma’am	4840	” Mr. Bumble tasted the medicine with a doubtful look ; smacked his lips ; took another taste ; and put the cup down empty . “
94965	94970	94976	94976	ma’am	4840	” said Mrs. Corney . “
94978	95005	94976	94976	ma’am	4840	” said the beadle . As he spoke , he drew a chair beside the matron , and tenderly inquired what had happened to distress her . “
95008	95013	94976	94976	ma’am	4840	” replied Mrs. Corney . “
95024	95025	95014	95014	I	0	” “
95031	95043	95014	95014	I	0	” retorted Mr. Bumble , drawing his chair a little closer . “
95053	95054	95050	95051	Mrs. Corney	211	” “
95061	95072	95055	95055	We	2625	” said Mrs. Corney , laying down a general principle . “
95077	95144	95145	95145	We	2625	” said the beadle . Nothing was said on either side , for a minute or two afterwards . By the expiration of that time , Mr. Bumble had illustrated the position by removing his left arm from the back of Mrs. Corney ’s chair , where it had previously rested , to Mrs. Corney ’s apron - string , round which it gradually became entwined . “
95151	95160	95145	95145	We	2625	” said Mr. Bumble . Mrs. Corney sighed . “
95168	95173	95165	95166	Mrs. Corney	211	” said Mr. Bumble . “
95180	95190	95174	95174	I	0	” said Mrs. Corney . And she sighed again . “
95200	95207	95198	95198	ma’am	4840	” said Mr. Bumble looking round . “
95222	95223	95214	95214	ma’am	4840	” “
95232	95237	95243	95243	ma’am	4840	” murmured the lady . “
95245	95254	95243	95243	ma’am	4840	” rejoined Mr. Bumble , in soft accents . “
95260	95322	95257	95258	Mrs. Corney	211	” Mrs. Corney drooped her head , when the beadle said this ; the beadle drooped his , to get a view of Mrs. Corney ’s face . Mrs. Corney , with great propriety , turned her head away , and released her hand to get at her pocket - handkerchief ; but insensibly replaced it in that of Mr. Bumble . “
95336	95346	95331	95331	they	2633	” inquired the beadle , affectionately pressing her hand . “
95350	95360	95331	95331	they	2633	” replied Mrs. Corney , slightly returning the pressure . “
95371	95376	95331	95331	they	2633	” said Mr. Bumble . “
95388	95424	95383	95384	an Angel	2635	” The lady was not proof against this burst of feeling . She sank into Mr. Bumble ’s arms ; and that gentleman in his agitation , imprinted a passionate kiss upon her chaste nose . “
95429	95436	95437	95437	You	211	” exclaimed Mr. Bumble , rapturously . “
95449	95450	95446	95447	my fascinator	2636	” “
95453	95460	95446	95447	my fascinator	2636	” replied Mrs. Corney , bashfully . “
95472	95477	95468	95469	the doctor	4910	” pursued Mr. Bumble . “
95522	95527	95555	95555	Corney	211	” Mrs. Corney sobbed . “
95532	95543	95555	95555	Corney	211	” said Mr. Bumble , bending over the bashful beauty . “
95557	95558	95559	95559	Ye	211	” “
95565	95571	95559	95559	Ye	211	” sighed out the matron . “
95575	95580	95559	95559	Ye	211	” pursued the beadle ; “
95597	95642	95559	95559	Ye	211	” Mrs. Corney twice essayed to speak : and twice failed . At length summoning up courage , she threw her arms around Mr. Bumble ’s neck , and said , it might be as soon as ever he pleased , and that he was “
95647	95705	95559	95559	Ye	211	” Matters being thus amicably and satisfactorily arranged , the contract was solemnly ratified in another teacupful of the peppermint mixture ; which was rendered the more necessary , by the flutter and agitation of the lady ’s spirits . While it was being disposed of , she acquainted Mr. Bumble with the old woman ’s decease . “
95709	95718	95559	95559	Ye	211	” said that gentleman , sipping his peppermint ; “
95747	95748	95780	95780	you	211	” “
95757	95763	95755	95755	dear	4730	” said the lady evasively . “
95772	95777	95755	95755	dear	4730	” urged Mr. Bumble . “
95786	95787	95780	95780	you	211	” “
95791	95796	95755	95755	dear	4730	” rejoined the lady ; “
95809	95810	95807	95807	dear	4730	” “
95816	95821	95807	95807	dear	4730	” exclaimed Mr. Bumble . “
95835	95836	95807	95807	dear	4730	” “
95843	95850	95807	95807	dear	4730	” interposed the lady , hastily . “
95857	95862	95852	95852	I	0	” continued Mr. Bumble ; “
95883	95884	95864	95864	I	0	” “
95896	95901	95902	95902	They	2646	” responded the lady . “
95907	95916	95864	95864	I	0	” said Mr. Bumble , clenching his fist . “
95951	96441	95942	95942	he	2650	” Unembellished by any violence of gesticulation , this might have seemed no very high compliment to the lady ’s charms ; but , as Mr. Bumble accompanied the threat with many warlike gestures , she was much touched with this proof of his devotion , and protested , with great admiration , that he was indeed a dove . The dove then turned up his coat - collar , and put on his cocked hat ; and , having exchanged a long and affectionate embrace with his future partner , once again braved the cold wind of the night : merely pausing , for a few minutes , in the male paupers ’ ward , to abuse them a little , with the view of satisfying himself that he could fill the office of workhouse - master with needful acerbity . Assured of his qualifications , Mr. Bumble left the building with a light heart , and bright visions of his future promotion : which served to occupy his mind until he reached the shop of the undertaker . Now , Mr. and Mrs. Sowerberry having gone out to tea and supper : and Noah Claypole not being at any time disposed to take upon himself a greater amount of physical exertion than is necessary to a convenient performance of the two functions of eating and drinking , the shop was not closed , although it was past the usual hour of shutting - up . Mr. Bumble tapped with his cane on the counter several times ; but , attracting no attention , and beholding a light shining through the glass - window of the little parlour at the back of the shop , he made bold to peep in and see what was going forward ; and when he saw what was going forward , he was not a little surprised . The cloth was laid for supper ; the table was covered with bread and butter , plates and glasses ; a porter - pot and a wine - bottle . At the upper end of the table , Mr. Noah Claypole lolled negligently in an easy - chair , with his legs thrown over one of the arms : an open clasp - knife in one hand , and a mass of buttered bread in the other . Close beside him stood Charlotte , opening oysters from a barrel : which Mr. Claypole condescended to swallow , with remarkable avidity . A more than ordinary redness in the region of the young gentleman ’s nose , and a kind of fixed wink in his right eye , denoted that he was in a slight degree intoxicated ; these symptoms were confirmed by the intense relish with which he took his oysters , for which nothing but a strong appreciation of their cooling properties , in cases of internal fever , could have sufficiently accounted . “
96453	96457	96459	96459	him	146	” said Charlotte ; “
96467	96468	96459	96459	him	146	” “
96477	96488	96459	96459	him	146	” remarked Mr. Claypole , after he had swallowed it . “
96512	96513	96510	96510	Charlotte	144	” “
96520	96524	96510	96510	Charlotte	144	” said Charlotte . “
96529	96534	96510	96510	Charlotte	144	” acquiesced Mr. Claypole . “
96541	96542	96536	96536	yer	146	” “
96546	96550	96536	96536	yer	146	” replied Charlotte . “
96568	96569	96566	96566	myself	0	” “
96572	96578	96566	96566	myself	0	” said Noah , reflectively ; “
96582	96583	96536	96536	yer	146	” “
96587	96591	96536	96536	yer	146	” said Charlotte . “
96603	96604	96605	96605	I	0	” “
96612	96616	96605	96605	I	0	” said Noah . “
96633	96634	96628	96628	I	0	” “
96637	96647	96652	96652	sir	4543	” said Mr. Bumble , bursting into the room . “
96654	96696	96652	96652	sir	4543	” Charlotte uttered a scream , and hid her face in her apron . Mr. Claypole , without making any further change in his position than suffering his legs to reach the ground , gazed at the beadle in drunken terror . “
96707	96712	96704	96705	owdacious fellow	2653	” said Mr. Bumble . “
96737	96746	96735	96735	her	2656	” exclaimed Mr. Bumble , in strong indignation . “
96749	96750	96751	96751	I	0	” “
96759	96765	96751	96751	I	0	” said Noah , blubbering . “
96783	96784	96766	96766	She	2656	” “
96789	96795	96796	96796	Yer	2657	” cried Charlotte , reproachfully . “
96804	96808	96809	96809	She	2656	” retorted Noah . “
96841	96842	96823	96823	she	2656	” “
96845	96852	96823	96823	she	2656	” cried Mr. Bumble , sternly . “
96915	96925	96909	96909	you	146	” cried Mr. Bumble , holding up his hands . “
96967	97057	97058	97058	Wolves	2673	” With these words , the beadle strode , with a lofty and gloomy air , from the undertaker ’s premises . And now that we have accompanied him so far on his road home , and have made all necessary preparations for the old woman ’s funeral , let us set on foot a few inquires after young Oliver Twist , and ascertain whether he be still lying in the ditch where Toby Crackit left him . CHAPTER XXVIII . LOOKS AFTER OLIVER , AND PROCEEDS WITH HIS ADVENTURES “
97063	97071	97058	97058	Wolves	2673	” muttered Sikes , grinding his teeth . “
97089	97186	97081	97081	you	2674	” As Sikes growled forth this imprecation , with the most desperate ferocity that his desperate nature was capable of , he rested the body of the wounded boy across his bended knee ; and turned his head , for an instant , to look back at his pursuers . There was little to be made out , in the mist and darkness ; but the loud shouting of men vibrated through the air , and the barking of the neighbouring dogs , roused by the sound of the alarm bell , resounded in every direction . “
97195	97220	97081	97081	you	2674	” cried the robber , shouting after Toby Crackit , who , making the best use of his long legs , was already ahead . “
97223	97267	97081	97081	you	2674	” The repetition of the word , brought Toby to a dead stand - still . For he was not quite satisfied that he was beyond the range of pistol - shot ; and Sikes was in no mood to be played with . “
97275	97285	97081	97081	you	2674	” cried Sikes , beckoning furiously to his confederate . “
97289	97321	97081	97081	you	2674	” Toby made a show of returning ; but ventured , in a low voice , broken for want of breath , to intimate considerable reluctance as he came slowly along . “
97324	97347	97081	97081	you	2674	” cried Sikes , laying the boy in a dry ditch at his feet , and drawing a pistol from his pocket . “
97355	97406	97081	97081	you	2674	” At this moment the noise grew louder . Sikes , again looking round , could discern that the men who had given chase were already climbing the gate of the field in which he stood ; and that a couple of dogs were some paces in advance of them . “
97414	97418	97081	97081	you	2674	” cried Toby ; “
97429	97558	97426	97426	your	149	” With this parting advice , Mr. Crackit , preferring the chance of being shot by his friend , to the certainty of being taken by his enemies , fairly turned tail , and darted off at full speed . Sikes clenched his teeth ; took one look around ; threw over the prostrate form of Oliver , the cape in which he had been hurriedly muffled ; ran along the front of the hedge , as if to distract the attention of those behind , from the spot where the boy lay ; paused , for a second , before another hedge which met it at right angles ; and whirling his pistol high into the air , cleared it at a bound , and was gone . “
97565	97574	97575	97575	Pincher	231	” cried a tremulous voice in the rear . “
97585	97639	97640	97640	My	0	” The dogs , who , in common with their masters , seemed to have no particular relish for the sport in which they were engaged , readily answered to the command . Three men , who had by this time advanced some distance into the field , stopped to take counsel together . “
97658	97667	97640	97640	My	0	” said the fattest man of the party , “
97676	97677	97678	97678	I	0	” “
97690	97725	97678	97678	I	0	” said a shorter man ; who was by no means of a slim figure , and who was very pale in the face , and very polite : as frightened men frequently are . “
97738	97750	97751	97752	Mr. Giles	233	” said the third , who had called the dogs back , “
97757	97758	97751	97752	Mr. Giles	233	” “
97761	97767	97751	97752	Mr. Giles	233	” replied the shorter man ; “
97801	97845	97796	97796	I	0	” To tell the truth , the little man _ did _ seem to know his situation , and to know perfectly well that it was by no means a desirable one ; for his teeth chattered in his head as he spoke . “
97852	97857	97858	97858	I	0	” said Mr. Giles . “
97861	97865	97858	97858	I	0	” said Brittles . “
97869	97873	97866	97866	You	2682	” said Giles . “
97882	97886	97879	97880	Mr. Giles	233	” said Brittles . “
97894	97952	97892	97892	Brittles	234	” said Mr. Giles . Now , these four retorts arose from Mr. Giles ’s taunt ; and Mr. Giles ’s taunt had arisen from his indignation at having the responsibility of going home again , imposed upon himself under cover of a compliment . The third man brought the dispute to a close , most philosophically . “
97963	97967	97892	97892	Brittles	234	” said he , “
97973	97974	97892	97892	Brittles	234	” “
97981	97994	97977	97977	yourself	233	” said Mr. Giles , who was the palest of the party . “
97999	98004	97996	97996	I	0	” replied the man . “
98021	98022	98018	98018	I	0	” “
98027	98031	98025	98025	I	0	” said Brittles ; “
98047	98120	98041	98041	he	476	” These frank admissions softened Mr. Giles , who at once owned that _ he _ was afraid ; upon which , they all three faced about , and ran back again with the completest unanimity , until Mr. Giles ( who had the shortest wind of the party , as was encumbered with a pitchfork ) most handsomely insisted on stopping , to make an apology for his hastiness of speech . “
98126	98136	98041	98041	he	476	” said Mr. Giles , when he had explained , “
98169	98209	98210	98210	I	0	” As the other two were impressed with a similar presentiment ; and as their blood , like his , had all gone down again ; some speculation ensued upon the cause of this sudden change in their temperament . “
98216	98221	98210	98210	I	0	” said Mr. Giles ; “
98227	98228	98229	98229	I	0	” “
98237	98246	98229	98229	I	0	” exclaimed Brittles , catching at the idea . “
98253	98257	98247	98247	You	2690	” said Giles , “
98283	99634	98268	98268	I	0	” By a remarkable coincidence , the other two had been visited with the same unpleasant sensation at that precise moment . It was quite obvious , therefore , that it was the gate ; especially as there was no doubt regarding the time at which the change had taken place , because all three remembered that they had come in sight of the robbers at the instant of its occurance . This dialogue was held between the two men who had surprised the burglars , and a travelling tinker who had been sleeping in an outhouse , and who had been roused , together with his two mongrel curs , to join in the pursuit . Mr. Giles acted in the double capacity of butler and steward to the old lady of the mansion ; Brittles was a lad of all - work : who , having entered her service a mere child , was treated as a promising young boy still , though he was something past thirty . Encouraging each other with such converse as this ; but , keeping very close together , notwithstanding , and looking apprehensively round , whenever a fresh gust rattled through the boughs ; the three men hurried back to a tree , behind which they had left their lantern , lest its light should inform the thieves in what direction to fire . Catching up the light , they made the best of their way home , at a good round trot ; and long after their dusky forms had ceased to be discernible , the light might have been seen twinkling and dancing in the distance , like some exhalation of the damp and gloomy atmosphere through which it was swiftly borne . The air grew colder , as day came slowly on ; and the mist rolled along the ground like a dense cloud of smoke . The grass was wet ; the pathways , and low places , were all mire and water ; the damp breath of an unwholesome wind went languidly by , with a hollow moaning . Still , Oliver lay motionless and insensible on the spot where Sikes had left him . Morning drew on apace . The air became more sharp and piercing , as its first dull hue — the death of night , rather than the birth of day — glimmered faintly in the sky . The objects which had looked dim and terrible in the darkness , grew more and more defined , and gradually resolved into their familiar shapes . The rain came down , thick and fast , and pattered noisily among the leafless bushes . But , Oliver felt it not , as it beat against him ; for he still lay stretched , helpless and unconscious , on his bed of clay . At length , a low cry of pain broke the stillness that prevailed ; and uttering it , the boy awoke . His left arm , rudely bandaged in a shawl , hung heavy and useless at his side ; the bandage was saturated with blood . He was so weak , that he could scarcely raise himself into a sitting posture ; when he had done so , he looked feebly round for help , and groaned with pain . Trembling in every joint , from cold and exhaustion , he made an effort to stand upright ; but , shuddering from head to foot , fell prostrate on the ground . After a short return of the stupor in which he had been so long plunged , Oliver : urged by a creeping sickness at his heart , which seemed to warn him that if he lay there , he must surely die : got upon his feet , and essayed to walk . His head was dizzy , and he staggered to and fro like a drunken man . But he kept up , nevertheless , and , with his head drooping languidly on his breast , went stumbling onward , he knew not whither . And now , hosts of bewildering and confused ideas came crowding on his mind . He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit , who were angrily disputing — for the very words they said , sounded in his ears ; and when he caught his own attention , as it were , by making some violent effort to save himself from falling , he found that he was talking to them . Then , he was alone with Sikes , plodding on as on the previous day ; and as shadowy people passed them , he felt the robber ’s grasp upon his wrist . Suddenly , he started back at the report of firearms ; there rose into the air , loud cries and shouts ; lights gleamed before his eyes ; all was noise and tumult , as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away . Through all these rapid visions , there ran an undefined , uneasy consciousness of pain , which wearied and tormented him incessantly . Thus he staggered on , creeping , almost mechanically , between the bars of gates , or through hedge - gaps as they came in his way , until he reached a road . Here the rain began to fall so heavily , that it roused him . He looked about , and saw that at no great distance there was a house , which perhaps he could reach . Pitying his condition , they might have compassion on him ; and if they did not , it would be better , he thought , to die near human beings , than in the lonely open fields . He summoned up all his strength for one last trial , and bent his faltering steps towards it . As he drew nearer to this house , a feeling come over him that he had seen it before . He remembered nothing of its details ; but the shape and aspect of the building seemed familiar to him . That garden wall ! On the grass inside , he had fallen on his knees last night , and prayed the two men ’s mercy . It was the very house they had attempted to rob . Oliver felt such fear come over him when he recognised the place , that , for the instant , he forgot the agony of his wound , and thought only of flight . Flight ! He could scarcely stand : and if he were in full possession of all the best powers of his slight and youthful frame , whither could he fly ? He pushed against the garden - gate ; it was unlocked , and swung open on its hinges . He tottered across the lawn ; climbed the steps ; knocked faintly at the door ; and , his whole strength failing him , sunk down against one of the pillars of the little portico . It happened that about this time , Mr. Giles , Brittles , and the tinker , were recruiting themselves , after the fatigues and terrors of the night , with tea and sundries , in the kitchen . Not that it was Mr. Giles ’s habit to admit to too great familiarity the humbler servants : towards whom it was rather his wo nt to deport himself with a lofty affability , which , while it gratified , could not fail to remind them of his superior position in society . But , death , fires , and burglary , make all men equals ; so Mr. Giles sat with his legs stretched out before the kitchen fender , leaning his left arm on the table , while , with his right , he illustrated a circumstantial and minute account of the robbery , to which his hearers ( but especially the cook and housemaid , who were of the party ) listened with breathless interest . “
99643	99648	99650	99650	I	0	” said Mr. Giles , “
99719	99755	99714	99714	I	0	” At this point of the narrative the cook turned pale , and asked the housemaid to shut the door : who asked Brittles , who asked the tinker , who pretended not to hear . “
99761	99766	99767	99767	I	0	” continued Mr. Giles . “
99796	99797	99788	99788	I	0	” “
99804	99809	99788	99788	I	0	” asked the cook . “
99817	99826	99788	99788	I	0	” replied Mr. Giles , looking round him . “
99842	99846	99788	99788	I	0	” suggested Brittles . “
99859	99864	99852	99852	you	2692	” rejoined Mr. Giles ; “
99882	99894	99788	99788	I	0	” ; continued Giles , rolling back the table - cloth , “
99903	99910	99788	99788	I	0	” The cook and housemaid simultaneously ejaculated “
99913	99921	99922	99922	I	0	” and drew their chairs closer together . “
99930	99935	99922	99922	I	0	” resumed Mr. Giles . “
100006	100044	100045	100045	I	0	” Here , all eyes were turned upon Brittles , who fixed his upon the speaker , and stared at him , with his mouth wide open , and his face expressive of the most unmitigated horror . “
100051	100072	100045	100045	I	0	” said Giles , throwing away the table - cloth , and looking very hard at the cook and housemaid , “
100085	100086	100087	100088	Ladies present	2696	” “
100093	100098	100090	100091	Mr. Giles	233	” murmured the tinker . “
100107	100123	100090	100091	Mr. Giles	233	” said Giles , turning upon him , and laying great emphasis on the word ; “
100166	100167	100150	100150	I	0	” “
100172	100181	100169	100169	you	0	” observed Brittles , in a low voice . “
100197	100201	100194	100194	I	0	” continued Giles ; “
100210	100211	100215	100215	he	2695	” “
100218	100223	100215	100215	he	2695	” asked the cook . “
100230	100235	100215	100215	he	2695	” replied Mr. Giles . “
100251	100252	100236	100236	He	2695	” “
100270	100275	100268	100268	me	0	” observed the housemaid . “
100281	100290	100276	100276	You	0	” retorted Brittles , plucking up a little . “
100295	100306	100308	100309	a woman	4784	” said Mr. Giles , nodding his head , approvingly ; “
100349	100402	100422	100422	somebody	5093	” Mr. Giles had risen from his seat , and taken two steps with his eyes shut , to accompany his description with appropriate action , when he started violently , in common with the rest of the company , and hurried back to his chair . The cook and housemaid screamed . “
100408	100417	100422	100422	somebody	5093	” said Mr. Giles , assuming perfect serenity . “
100424	100428	100422	100422	somebody	5093	” Nobody moved . “
100449	100468	100480	100480	somebody	5093	” said Mr. Giles , surveying the pale faces which surrounded him , and looking very blank himself ; “
100482	100556	100480	100480	somebody	5093	” Mr. Giles , as he spoke , looked at Brittles ; but that young man , being naturally modest , probably considered himself nobody , and so held that the inquiry could not have any application to him ; at all events , he tendered no reply . Mr. Giles directed an appealing glance at the tinker ; but he had suddenly fallen asleep . The women were out of the question . “
100571	100581	100558	100558	Brittles	234	” said Mr. Giles , after a short silence , “
100589	100590	100558	100558	Brittles	234	” “
100595	100817	100818	100819	A boy	4627	” said the tinker , waking up , as suddenly as he had fallen asleep . Brittles capitulated on these terms ; and the party being somewhat re - assured by the discovery ( made on throwing open the shutters ) that it was now broad day , took their way upstairs ; with the dogs in front . The two women , who were afraid to stay below , brought up the rear . By the advice of Mr. Giles , they all talked very loud , to warn any evil - disposed person outside , that they were strong in numbers ; and by a master - stoke of policy , originating in the brain of the same ingenious gentleman , the dogs ’ tails were well pinched , in the hall , to make them bark savagely . These precautions having been taken , Mr. Giles held on fast by the tinker ’s arm ( to prevent his running away , as he pleasantly said ) , and gave the word of command to open the door . Brittles obeyed ; the group , peeping timorously over each other ’s shoulders , beheld no more formidable object than poor little Oliver Twist , speechless and exhausted , who raised his heavy eyes , and mutely solicited their compassion . “
100821	100835	100818	100819	A boy	4627	” exclaimed Mr. Giles , valiantly , pushing the tinker into the background . “
100854	100916	100851	100851	you	2711	” Brittles , who had got behind the door to open it , no sooner saw Oliver , than he uttered a loud cry . Mr. Giles , seizing the boy by one leg and one arm ( fortunately not the broken limb ) lugged him straight into the hall , and deposited him at full length on the floor thereof . “
100921	100937	100918	100918	he	4627	” bawled Giles , calling in a state of great excitement , up the staircase ; “
100970	100971	100965	100965	Brittles	234	” “
100979	101067	101068	101068	Giles	233	” cried Brittles , applying one hand to the side of his mouth , so that his voice might travel the better . The two women - servants ran upstairs to carry the intelligence that Mr. Giles had captured a robber ; and the tinker busied himself in endeavouring to restore Oliver , lest he should die before he could be hanged . In the midst of all this noise and commotion , there was heard a sweet female voice , which quelled it in an instant . “
101070	101080	101068	101068	Giles	233	” whispered the voice from the stair - head . “
101087	101092	101085	101085	miss	2716	” replied Mr. Giles . “
101125	101126	101117	101117	I	0	” “
101129	101135	101136	101136	you	0	” replied the young lady ; “
101154	101155	101148	101150	the poor creature	2728	” “
101161	101169	101159	101159	miss	2716	” replied Giles , with indescribable complacency . “
101182	101193	101174	101174	he	2724	” bawled Brittles , in the same manner as before . “
101212	101213	101174	101174	he	2724	” “
101224	101229	101174	101174	he	2724	” rejoined the lady . “
101242	101317	101237	101237	I	0	” With a footstep as soft and gentle as the voice , the speaker tripped away . She soon returned , with the direction that the wounded person was to be carried , carefully , upstairs to Mr. Giles ’s room ; and that Brittles was to saddle the pony and betake himself instantly to Chertsey : from which place , he was to despatch , with all speed , a constable and doctor . “
101332	101358	101321	101321	you	2716	” asked Mr. Giles , with as much pride as if Oliver were some bird of rare plumage , that he had skilfully brought down . “
101366	101367	101364	101364	miss	2716	” “
101375	101381	101382	101383	Poor fellow	4845	” replied the young lady . “
101396	101962	101391	101391	Giles	233	” The old servant looked up at the speaker , as she turned away , with a glance as proud and admiring as if she had been his own child . Then , bending over Oliver , he helped to carry him upstairs , with the care and solicitude of a woman . CHAPTER XXIX . HAS AN INTRODUCTORY ACCOUNT OF THE INMATES OF THE HOUSE , TO WHICH OLIVER RESORTED In a handsome room : though its furniture had rather the air of old - fashioned comfort , than of modern elegance : there sat two ladies at a well - spread breakfast - table . Mr. Giles , dressed with scrupulous care in a full suit of black , was in attendance upon them . He had taken his station some half - way between the side - board and the breakfast - table ; and , with his body drawn up to its full height , his head thrown back , and inclined the merest trifle on one side , his left leg advanced , and his right hand thrust into his waist - coat , while his left hung down by his side , grasping a waiter , looked like one who laboured under a very agreeable sense of his own merits and importance . Of the two ladies , one was well advanced in years ; but the high - backed oaken chair in which she sat , was not more upright than she . Dressed with the utmost nicety and precision , in a quaint mixture of by - gone costume , with some slight concessions to the prevailing taste , which rather served to point the old style pleasantly than to impair its effect , she sat , in a stately manner , with her hands folded on the table before her . Her eyes ( and age had dimmed but little of their brightness ) were attentively upon her young companion . The younger lady was in the lovely bloom and spring - time of womanhood ; at that age , when , if ever angels be for God ’s good purposes enthroned in mortal forms , they may be , without impiety , supposed to abide in such as hers . She was not past seventeen . Cast in so slight and exquisite a mould ; so mild and gentle ; so pure and beautiful ; that earth seemed not her element , nor its rough creatures her fit companions . The very intelligence that shone in her deep blue eye , and was stamped upon her noble head , seemed scarcely of her age , or of the world ; and yet the changing expression of sweetness and good humour , the thousand lights that played about the face , and left no shadow there ; above all , the smile , the cheerful , happy smile , were made for Home , and fireside peace and happiness . She was busily engaged in the little offices of the table . Chancing to raise her eyes as the elder lady was regarding her , she playfully put back her hair , which was simply braided on her forehead ; and threw into her beaming look , such an expression of affection and artless loveliness , that blessed spirits might have smiled to look upon her . “
101976	101986	101974	101974	he	234	” asked the old lady , after a pause . “
101995	102015	101974	101974	he	234	” replied Mr. Giles , referring to a silver watch , which he drew forth by a black ribbon . “
102021	102027	102016	102016	He	234	” remarked the old lady . “
102037	102075	102031	102033	a slow boy	2739	” replied the attendant . And seeing , by the bye , that Brittles had been a slow boy for upwards of thirty years , there appeared no great probability of his ever being a fast one . “
102086	102092	102083	102083	I	0	” said the elder lady . “
102109	102190	102191	102191	I	0	” said the young lady , smiling . Mr. Giles was apparently considering the propriety of indulging in a respectful smile himself , when a gig drove up to the garden - gate : out of which there jumped a fat gentleman , who ran straight up to the door : and who , getting quickly into the house by some mysterious process , burst into the room , and nearly overturned Mr. Giles and the breakfast - table together . “
102199	102205	102206	102206	My	0	” exclaimed the fat gentleman . “
102234	102262	102224	102224	I	0	” With these expressions of condolence , the fat gentleman shook hands with both ladies , and drawing up a chair , inquired how they found themselves . “
102275	102281	102263	102263	You	236	” said the fat gentleman . “
102340	102398	102400	102400	you	4730	” The doctor seemed especially troubled by the fact of the robbery having been unexpected , and attempted in the night - time ; as if it were the established custom of gentlemen in the housebreaking way to transact business at noon , and to make an appointment , by post , a day or two previous . “
102405	102416	102417	102417	I	0	” said the doctor , turning to the young lady , “
102419	102420	102417	102417	I	0	” “
102429	102436	102417	102417	I	0	” said Rose , interrupting him ; “
102452	102453	102446	102446	aunt	2733	” “
102460	102465	102446	102446	aunt	2733	” replied the doctor , “
102480	102509	102475	102475	Giles	233	” Mr. Giles , who had been feverishly putting the tea - cups to rights , blushed very red , and said that he had had that honour . “
102514	102519	102477	102477	I	0	” said the doctor ; “
102567	102617	102565	102565	Giles	233	” Mr. Giles , who thought this light treatment of the matter an unjust attempt at diminishing his glory , answered respectfully , that it was not for the like of him to judge about that ; but he rather thought it was no joke to the opposite party . “
102624	102629	102565	102565	Giles	233	” said the doctor . “
102675	102719	102720	102721	the doctor	4910	” Talking all the way , he followed Mr. Giles upstairs ; and while he is going upstairs , the reader may be informed , that Mr. Losberne , a surgeon in the neighbourhood , known through a circuit of ten miles round as “
102723	102856	102720	102721	the doctor	4910	” had grown fat , more from good - humour than from good living : and was as kind and hearty , and withal as eccentric an old bachelor , as will be found in five times that space , by any explorer alive . The doctor was absent , much longer than either he or the ladies had anticipated . A large flat box was fetched out of the gig ; and a bedroom bell was rung very often ; and the servants ran up and down stairs perpetually ; from which tokens it was justly concluded that something important was going on above . At length he returned ; and in reply to an anxious inquiry after his patient ; looked very mysterious , and closed the door , carefully . “
102867	102887	102864	102865	Mrs. Maylie	236	” said the doctor , standing with his back to the door , as if to keep it shut . “
102897	102903	102894	102894	I	0	” said the old lady . “
102920	102925	102927	102927	I	0	” replied the doctor ; “
102940	102941	102935	102935	you	0	” “
102944	102950	102935	102935	you	0	” rejoined the old lady . “
102957	102958	102965	102965	your	236	” “
102961	102962	102965	102965	your	236	” “
102970	102975	102963	102963	I	0	” interposed Mr. Giles ; “
102991	103071	102986	102987	Doctor Losberne	239	” The fact was , that Mr. Giles had not , at first , been able to bring his mind to the avowal , that he had only shot a boy . Such commendations had been bestowed upon his bravery , that he could not , for the life of him , help postponing the explanation for a few delicious minutes ; during which he had flourished , in the very zenith of a brief reputation for undaunted courage . “
103079	103084	103072	103072	Rose	237	” said Mrs. Maylie , “
103093	103094	103086	103086	I	0	” “
103097	103102	103086	103086	I	0	” rejoined the doctor . “

103130	103136	103113	103113	you	236	” replied the old lady , “

103149	103154	103143	103143	I	0	” said the doctor ; “
103208	103271	103202	103202	I	0	” CHAPTER XXX . RELATES WHAT OLIVER ’S NEW VISITORS THOUGHT OF HIM With many loquacious assurances that they would be agreeably surprised in the aspect of the criminal , the doctor drew the young lady ’s arm through one of his ; and offering his disengaged hand to Mrs. Maylie , led them , with much ceremony and stateliness , upstairs . “
103274	103295	103300	103300	you	236	” said the doctor , in a whisper , as he softly turned the handle of a bedroom - door , “
103338	103638	103328	103328	me	0	” Stepping before them , he looked into the room . Motioning them to advance , he closed the door when they had entered ; and gently drew back the curtains of the bed . Upon it , in lieu of the dogged , black - visaged ruffian they had expected to behold , there lay a mere child : worn with pain and exhaustion , and sunk into a deep sleep . His wounded arm , bound and splintered up , was crossed upon his breast ; his head reclined upon the other arm , which was half hidden by his long hair , as it streamed over the pillow . The honest gentleman held the curtain in his hand , and looked on , for a minute or so , in silence . Whilst he was watching the patient thus , the younger lady glided softly past , and seating herself in a chair by the bedside , gathered Oliver ’s hair from his face . As she stooped over him , her tears fell upon his forehead . The boy stirred , and smiled in his sleep , as though these marks of pity and compassion had awakened some pleasant dream of a love and affection he had never known . Thus , a strain of gentle music , or the rippling of water in a silent place , or the odour of a flower , or the mention of a familiar word , will sometimes call up sudden dim remembrances of scenes that never were , in this life ; which vanish like a breath ; which some brief memory of a happier existence , long gone by , would seem to have awakened ; which no voluntary exertion of the mind can ever recall . “
103644	103650	103328	103328	me	0	” exclaimed the elder lady . “
103663	103664	103665	103665	Vice	240	” “
103667	103676	103679	103679	her	2760	” said the surgeon , replacing the curtain , “
103698	103699	103690	103692	a fair outside	2764	” “
103707	103711	103690	103692	a fair outside	2764	” urged Rose . “
103717	103727	103690	103692	a fair outside	2764	” rejoined the surgeon , mournfully shaking his head ; “
103754	103755	103743	103746	The youngest and fairest	2768	” “
103783	103823	103764	103764	you	0	” said Rose . The surgeon shook his head , in a manner which intimated that he feared it was very possible ; and observing that they might disturb the patient , led the way into an adjoining apartment . “
103832	103836	103759	103759	you	0	” pursued Rose , “
103986	103987	103988	103988	My	0	” “
103992	104008	104010	104010	you	5460	” said the elder lady , as she folded the weeping girl to her bosom , “
104021	104022	104010	104010	you	5460	” “
104027	104033	104010	104010	you	5460	” replied Rose , eagerly . “
104038	104044	104010	104010	you	5460	” said the old lady ; “
104077	104078	104069	104069	I	0	” “
104085	104090	104092	104092	me	0	” said the doctor ; “
104095	104133	104092	104092	me	0	” Mr. Losberne thrust his hands into his pockets , and took several turns up and down the room ; often stopping , and balancing himself on his toes , and frowning frightfully . After various exclamations of “
104139	104141	104092	104092	me	0	” and “
104148	104172	104144	104144	I	0	” and as many renewals of the walking and frowning , he at length made a dead halt , and spoke as follows : “
104244	104245	104237	104237	You	2785	” “
104257	104262	104265	104266	no other	2790	” replied Mrs. Maylie . “
104268	104273	104265	104266	no other	2790	” said the doctor . “
104283	104284	104265	104266	no other	2790	” “
104294	104303	104265	104266	no other	2790	” said Rose , smiling through her tears ; “
104319	104320	104321	104321	You	0	” “
104326	104331	104321	104321	You	0	” retorted the doctor , “
104421	104422	104423	104423	You	0	” “
104434	104440	104432	104432	himself	2798	” returned Rose , blushing . “
104443	104451	104432	104432	himself	2798	” said the doctor , laughing heartily , “
104605	104606	104610	104610	aunt	2733	” “
104612	104616	104610	104610	aunt	2733	” entreated Rose . “
104622	104627	104620	104620	aunt	2733	” said the doctor . “
104633	104634	104635	104635	He	4736	” “
104643	104647	104635	104635	He	4736	” said Rose ; “
104652	104653	104635	104635	He	4736	” “
104657	104662	104635	104635	He	4736	” retorted the doctor ; “
104675	105262	104635	104635	He	4736	” Finally the treaty was entered into ; and the parties thereunto sat down to wait , with some impatience , until Oliver should awake . The patience of the two ladies was destined to undergo a longer trial than Mr. Losberne had led them to expect ; for hour after hour passed on , and still Oliver slumbered heavily . It was evening , indeed , before the kind - hearted doctor brought them the intelligence , that he was at length sufficiently restored to be spoken to . The boy was very ill , he said , and weak from the loss of blood ; but his mind was so troubled with anxiety to disclose something , that he deemed it better to give him the opportunity , than to insist upon his remaining quiet until next morning : which he should otherwise have done . The conference was a long one . Oliver told them all his simple history , and was often compelled to stop , by pain and want of strength . It was a solemn thing , to hear , in the darkened room , the feeble voice of the sick child recounting a weary catalogue of evils and calamities which hard men had brought upon him . Oh ! if when we oppress and grind our fellow - creatures , we bestowed but one thought on the dark evidences of human error , which , like dense and heavy clouds , are rising , slowly it is true , but not less surely , to Heaven , to pour their after - vengeance on our heads ; if we heard but one instant , in imagination , the deep testimony of dead men ’s voices , which no power can stifle , and no pride shut out ; where would be the injury and injustice , the suffering , misery , cruelty , and wrong , that each day ’s life brings with it ! Oliver ’s pillow was smoothed by gentle hands that night ; and loveliness and virtue watched him as he slept . He felt calm and happy , and could have died without a murmur . The momentous interview was no sooner concluded , and Oliver composed to rest again , than the doctor , after wiping his eyes , and condemning them for being weak all at once , betook himself downstairs to open upon Mr. Giles . And finding nobody about the parlours , it occurred to him , that he could perhaps originate the proceedings with better effect in the kitchen ; so into the kitchen he went . There were assembled , in that lower house of the domestic parliament , the women - servants , Mr. Brittles , Mr. Giles , the tinker ( who had received a special invitation to regale himself for the remainder of the day , in consideration of his services ) , and the constable . The latter gentleman had a large staff , a large head , large features , and large half - boots ; and he looked as if he had been taking a proportionate allowance of ale — as indeed he had . The adventures of the previous night were still under discussion ; for Mr. Giles was expatiating upon his presence of mind , when the doctor entered ; Mr. Brittles , with a mug of ale in his hand , was corroborating everything , before his superior said it . “
105266	105275	104635	104635	He	4736	” said the doctor , waving his hand . “
105281	105286	105279	105279	sir	4543	” said Mr. Giles . “
105327	105383	105319	105319	I	0	” Brittles headed a low murmur , by which the ladies and gentlemen generally were understood to express the gratification they derived from Mr. Giles ’s condescension . Mr. Giles looked round with a patronising air , as much as to say that so long as they behaved properly , he would never desert them . “
105392	105396	105390	105390	sir	4543	” asked Giles . “
105400	105406	105390	105390	sir	4543	” ; returned the doctor . “
105422	105423	105419	105420	Mr. Giles	233	” “
105435	105442	105426	105426	you	4543	” said Mr. Giles , trembling , “
105488	105489	105486	105486	sir	4543	” “
105496	105503	105486	105486	sir	4543	” said the doctor , mysteriously . “
105512	105513	105516	105516	sir	4543	” “
105522	105533	105516	105516	sir	4543	” faltered Mr. Giles , who had turned very pale . “
105543	105553	105558	105558	sir	4543	” said the doctor , turning sharply upon Brittles . “
105560	105567	105558	105558	sir	4543	” replied Brittles , starting violently ; “
105578	105579	105576	105576	sir	4543	” “
105585	105590	105593	105593	you	4543	” said the doctor , “
105638	105691	105701	105701	you	2827	” The doctor , who was universally considered one of the best - tempered creatures on earth , made this demand in such a dreadful tone of anger , that Giles and Brittles , who were considerably muddled by ale and excitement , stared at each other in a state of stupefaction . “
105703	105738	105701	105701	you	2827	” said the doctor , shaking his forefinger with great solemnity of manner , and tapping the bridge of his nose with it , to bespeak the exercise of that worthy ’s utmost acuteness . “
105747	105776	105701	105701	you	2827	” The constable looked as wise as he could , and took up his staff of office : which had been reclining indolently in the chimney - corner . “
105789	105794	105785	105785	you	2827	” said the doctor . “
105803	105833	105801	105801	sir	4543	” replied the constable , coughing with great violence ; for he had finished his ale in a hurry , and some of it had gone the wrong way . “
105841	105846	105848	105851	a couple of men	1480	” said the doctor , “
105956	105980	105981	105981	I	0	” The constable nodded profoundly . He said , if that was n’t law , he would be glad to know what was . “
105986	105991	105993	105993	you	2839	” thundered the doctor , “
106006	106072	105993	105993	you	2839	” Brittles looked doubtfully at Mr. Giles ; Mr. Giles looked doubtfully at Brittles ; the constable put his hand behind his ear , to catch the reply ; the two women and the tinker leaned forward to listen ; the doctor glanced keenly round ; when a ring was heard at the gate , and at the same moment , the sound of wheels . “
106078	106088	106075	106076	the runners	2841	” cried Brittles , to all appearance much relieved . “
106092	106102	106075	106076	the runners	2841	” exclaimed the doctor , aghast in his turn . “
106110	106119	106120	106120	me	0	” replied Brittles , taking up a candle ; “
106130	106131	106122	106123	Mr. Giles	233	” “
106134	106139	106122	106123	Mr. Giles	233	” cried the doctor . “
106142	106146	106147	106147	I	0	” replied Brittles ; “
106168	106169	106170	106170	You	4543	” “
106189	106204	106178	106178	your	4543	” said the doctor , walking away . CHAPTER XXXI . INVOLVES A CRITICAL POSITION “
106209	106236	106178	106178	your	4543	” inquired Brittles , opening the door a little way , with the chain up , and peeping out , shading the candle with his hand . “
106241	106247	106178	106178	your	4543	” replied a man outside ; “
106262	106314	106250	106254	the officers from Bow Street	2848	” Much comforted by this assurance , Brittles opened the door to its full width , and confronted a portly man in a great - coat ; who walked in , without saying anything more , and wiped his shoes on the mat , as coolly as if he lived there . “
106330	106335	106336	106336	he	2850	” said the officer ; “
106371	106526	106349	106349	you	4543	” Brittles replying in the affirmative , and pointing out the building , the portly man stepped back to the garden - gate , and helped his companion to put up the gig : while Brittles lighted them , in a state of great admiration . This done , they returned to the house , and , being shown into a parlour , took off their great - coats and hats , and showed like what they were . The man who had knocked at the door , was a stout personage of middle height , aged about fifty : with shiny black hair , cropped pretty close ; half - whiskers , a round face , and sharp eyes . The other was a red - headed , bony man , in top - boots ; with a rather ill - favoured countenance , and a turned - up sinister - looking nose . “
106540	106561	106533	106533	Duff	243	” said the stouter man , smoothing down his hair , and laying a pair of handcuffs on the table . “
106586	106619	106583	106583	you	4543	” This was addressed to Mr. Losberne , who now made his appearance ; that gentleman , motioning Brittles to retire , brought in the two ladies , and shut the door . “
106628	106728	106583	106583	you	4543	” said Mr. Losberne , motioning towards Mrs. Maylie . Mr. Blathers made a bow . Being desired to sit down , he put his hat on the floor , and taking a chair , motioned to Duff to do the same . The latter gentleman , who did not appear quite so much accustomed to good society , or quite so much at his ease in it — one of the two — seated himself , after undergoing several muscular affections of the limbs , and the head of his stick into his mouth , with some embarrassment . “
106740	106744	106738	106738	master	4749	” said Blathers . “
106750	106787	106788	106788	I	0	” Mr. Losberne , who appeared desirous of gaining time , recounted them at great length , and with much circumlocution . Messrs. Blathers and Duff looked very knowing meanwhile , and occasionally exchanged a nod . “
106805	106809	106797	106797	I	0	” said Blathers ; “
106836	106837	106834	106834	Duff	243	” “
106841	106845	106834	106834	Duff	243	” replied Duff . “
106876	106885	106873	106874	a countryman	2862	” said Mr. Losberne , with a smile . “
106892	106896	106873	106874	a countryman	2862	” replied Blathers . “
106907	106908	106873	106874	a countryman	2862	” “
106911	106916	106873	106874	a countryman	2862	” replied the doctor . “
106936	106940	106928	106929	the servants	6705	” said Blathers . “
106945	106950	106928	106929	the servants	6705	” replied the doctor . “
106987	106988	106965	106965	he	2866	” “
106998	107002	106989	106989	Wery	2869	” remarked Duff . “
107010	107038	107004	107004	he	2866	” observed Blathers , nodding his head in a confirmatory way , and playing carelessly with the handcuffs , as if they were a pair of castanets . “
107072	107073	107068	107068	he	2866	” “
107078	107092	107068	107068	he	2866	” replied the doctor , with a nervous glance at the two ladies . “
107127	107128	107124	107124	I	0	” “
107131	107136	107124	107124	I	0	” rejoined Mr. Blathers . “
107160	107410	107412	107412	my	0	” Lights were then procured ; and Messrs. Blathers and Duff , attended by the native constable , Brittles , Giles , and everybody else in short , went into the little room at the end of the passage and looked out at the window ; and afterwards went round by way of the lawn , and looked in at the window ; and after that , had a candle handed out to inspect the shutter with ; and after that , a lantern to trace the footsteps with ; and after that , a pitchfork to poke the bushes with . This done , amidst the breathless interest of all beholders , they came in again ; and Mr. Giles and Brittles were put through a melodramatic representation of their share in the previous night ’s adventures : which they performed some six times over : contradicting each other , in not more than one important respect , the first time , and in not more than a dozen the last . This consummation being arrived at , Blathers and Duff cleared the room , and held a long council together , compared with which , for secrecy and solemnity , a consultation of great doctors on the knottiest point in medicine , would be mere child ’s play . Meanwhile , the doctor walked up and down the next room in a very uneasy state ; and Mrs. Maylie and Rose looked on , with anxious faces . “
107415	107432	107412	107412	my	0	” he said , making a halt , after a great number of very rapid turns , “
107440	107441	107412	107412	my	0	” “
107444	107448	107412	107412	my	0	” said Rose , “
107468	107469	107470	107470	I	0	” “
107479	107488	107470	107470	I	0	” said the doctor , shaking his head . “
107541	107542	107543	107543	You	0	” “
107549	107553	107543	107543	You	0	” interrupted Rose . “
107577	107582	107570	107572	an old fool	2881	” rejoined the doctor ; “
107602	107603	107594	107598	a practical police - officer	2882	” “
107607	107611	107594	107598	a practical police - officer	2882	” demanded Rose . “
107620	107625	107594	107598	a practical police - officer	2882	” replied the doctor : “
107868	107869	107863	107863	you	2896	” “
107877	107888	107870	107870	I	0	” replied Rose , smiling at the doctor ’s impetuosity ; “
107905	107906	107891	107891	I	0	” “
107909	107914	107891	107891	I	0	” replied the doctor ; “
107960	107993	107927	107927	They	2899	” Having given vent to this result of experience , the doctor put his hands into his pockets , and walked up and down the room with even greater rapidity than before . “
108001	108006	108009	108009	I	0	” said the doctor , “
108090	108091	108111	108111	they	2836	” “
108100	108104	108107	108107	dear	4730	” cried Rose . “
108117	108118	108111	108111	they	2836	” “
108123	108128	108111	108111	they	2836	” exclaimed Mrs. Maylie . “
108141	108142	108111	108111	they	2836	” “
108148	108165	108144	108144	I	0	” said Mr. Losberne , at last : sitting down with a kind of desperate calmness , “
108245	108246	108249	108249	master	4749	” “
108251	108275	108249	108249	master	4749	” said Blathers , entering the room followed by his colleague , and making the door fast , before he said any more . “
108284	108285	108249	108249	master	4749	” “
108297	108304	108305	108305	We	2900	” demanded the doctor , impatiently . “
108316	108340	108305	108305	We	2900	” said Blathers , turning to them , as if he pitied their ignorance , but had a contempt for the doctor ’s , “
108348	108349	108350	108350	Nobody	316	” “
108358	108363	108350	108350	Nobody	316	” said Mrs. Maylie . “
108370	108374	108364	108364	Wery	2912	” replied Blathers ; “
108387	108388	108376	108376	they	6705	” “
108396	108400	108376	108376	they	6705	” said Duff . “
108409	108417	108405	108407	a town hand	2914	” said Blathers , continuing his report ; “
108428	108429	108430	108430	Wery	2912	” “
108436	108444	108430	108430	Wery	2912	” remarked Duff , in an undertone . “
108453	108457	108459	108459	they	6705	” continued Blathers ; “
108502	108503	108488	108489	this lad	2916	” “
108516	108535	108513	108514	Mrs. Maylie	236	” said the doctor : his face brightening , as if some new thought had occurred to him . “
108542	108548	108513	108514	Mrs. Maylie	236	” exclaimed Rose , eagerly . “
108559	108560	108549	108549	You	2917	” “
108568	108581	108564	108564	you	236	” said Blathers , drawing his coat - sleeve across his mouth ; “
108612	108613	108602	108602	yourself	2917	” “
108619	108632	108602	108602	yourself	2917	” asked the doctor , following the young lady to the sideboard . “
108648	108652	108639	108639	master	4749	” replied Blathers . “
108676	108708	108664	108664	I	0	” This interesting communication was addressed to Mrs. Maylie , who received it very graciously . While it was being conveyed to her , the doctor slipped out of the room . “
108711	108749	108664	108664	I	0	” said Mr. Blathers : not holding his wine - glass by the stem , but grasping the bottom between the thumb and forefinger of his left hand : and placing it in front of his chest ; “
108768	108769	108766	108766	ladies	928	” “
108782	108793	108780	108780	Blathers	242	” said Mr. Duff , assisting his colleague ’s memory . “
108804	108809	108780	108780	Blathers	242	” rejoined Mr. Blathers ; “
108820	108821	108814	108815	Conkey Chickweed	245	” “
108828	108832	108822	108822	You	242	” replied Duff . “
108856	108857	108853	108853	I	0	” “
108861	108866	108867	108867	I	0	” retorted Mr. Blathers ; “
108904	108905	108899	108899	I	0	” “
108910	108928	108899	108899	I	0	” inquired Rose : anxious to encourage any symptoms of good - humour in the unwelcome visitors . “
108945	108949	108899	108899	I	0	” said Blathers . “
108955	108956	108952	108953	Conkey Chickweed	245	” “
108963	108967	108957	108957	Conkey	245	” interposed Duff . “
108979	108984	108977	108977	she	711	” demanded Mr. Blathers . “
109866	109867	109858	109859	Mr. Chickweed	245	” “
109874	109893	109894	109895	Jem Spyers	247	” inquired the doctor ; who had returned to the room shortly after the commencement of the story . “
109897	109902	109894	109895	Jem Spyers	247	” resumed the officer , “
110064	110082	110052	110052	he	247	” said Mr. Blathers , putting down his wine - glass , and clinking the handcuffs together . “
110088	110093	110052	110052	he	247	” observed the doctor . “
110105	110106	110113	110113	sir	4543	” “
110115	110214	110109	110109	you	247	” returned Mr. Blathers . Closely following Mr. Losberne , the two officers ascended to Oliver ’s bedroom ; Mr. Giles preceding the party , with a lighted candle . Oliver had been dozing ; but looked worse , and was more feverish than he had appeared yet . Being assisted by the doctor , he managed to sit up in bed for a minute or so ; and looked at the strangers without at all understanding what was going forward — in fact , without seeming to recollect where he was , or what had been passing . “
110217	110231	110234	110235	the lad	2982	” said Mr. Losberne , speaking softly , but with great vehemence notwithstanding , “
110314	110359	110360	110360	You	0	” Messrs. Blathers and Duff looked at Mr. Giles , as he was thus recommended to their notice . The bewildered butler gazed from them towards Oliver , and from Oliver towards Mr. Losberne , with a most ludicrous mixture of fear and perplexity . “
110371	110382	110360	110360	You	0	” said the doctor , laying Oliver gently down again . “
110396	110400	110394	110394	sir	4543	” answered Giles . “
110430	110431	110420	110420	I	0	” “
110438	110444	110435	110436	what boy	2990	” inquired the senior officer . “
110452	110456	110457	110457	They	2004	” replied Giles . “
110465	110466	110457	110457	They	2004	” “
110475	110479	110470	110470	you	2995	” inquired Blathers . “
110485	110495	110470	110470	you	2995	” replied Giles , looking vacantly at his questioner . “
110507	110513	110499	110501	the same boy	2996	” rejoined Blathers , impatiently . “
110525	110534	110519	110519	I	0	” said Giles , with a rueful countenance . “
110542	110543	110535	110535	I	0	” “
110549	110554	110546	110546	you	2995	” asked Mr. Blathers . “
110563	110568	110555	110555	I	0	” replied poor Giles . “
110596	110597	110589	110589	You	2995	” “
110608	110617	110599	110600	this man	5062	” inquired Blathers , turning to the doctor . “
110628	111533	111534	111535	Poor fellow	4845	” said Duff , addressing Mr. Giles , with supreme contempt . Mr. Losberne had been feeling the patient ’s pulse during this short dialogue ; but he now rose from the chair by the bedside , and remarked , that if the officers had any doubts upon the subject , they would perhaps like to step into the next room , and have Brittles before them . Acting upon this suggestion , they adjourned to a neighbouring apartment , where Mr. Brittles , being called in , involved himself and his respected superior in such a wonderful maze of fresh contradictions and impossibilities , as tended to throw no particular light on anything , but the fact of his own strong mystification ; except , indeed , his declarations that he should n’t know the real boy , if he were put before him that instant ; that he had only taken Oliver to be he , because Mr. Giles had said he was ; and that Mr. Giles had , five minutes previously , admitted in the kitchen , that he began to be very much afraid he had been a little too hasty . Among other ingenious surmises , the question was then raised , whether Mr. Giles had really hit anybody ; and upon examination of the fellow pistol to that which he had fired , it turned out to have no more destructive loading than gunpowder and brown paper : a discovery which made a considerable impression on everybody but the doctor , who had drawn the ball about ten minutes before . Upon no one , however , did it make a greater impression than on Mr. Giles himself ; who , after labouring , for some hours , under the fear of having mortally wounded a fellow - creature , eagerly caught at this new idea , and favoured it to the utmost . Finally , the officers , without troubling themselves very much about Oliver , left the Chertsey constable in the house , and took up their rest for that night in the town ; promising to return the next morning . With the next morning , there came a rumour , that two men and a boy were in the cage at Kingston , who had been apprehended over night under suspicious circumstances ; and to Kingston Messrs. Blathers and Duff journeyed accordingly . The suspicious circumstances , however , resolving themselves , on investigation , into the one fact , that they had been discovered sleeping under a haystack ; which , although a great crime , is only punishable by imprisonment , and is , in the merciful eye of the English law , and its comprehensive love of all the King ’s subjects , held to be no satisfactory proof , in the absence of all other evidence , that the sleeper , or sleepers , have committed burglary accompanied with violence , and have therefore rendered themselves liable to the punishment of death ; Messrs. Blathers and Duff came back again , as wise as they went . In short , after some more examination , and a great deal more conversation , a neighbouring magistrate was readily induced to take the joint bail of Mrs. Maylie and Mr. Losberne for Oliver ’s appearance if he should ever be called upon ; and Blathers and Duff , being rewarded with a couple of guineas , returned to town with divided opinions on the subject of their expedition : the latter gentleman on a mature consideration of all the circumstances , inclining to the belief that the burglarious attempt had originated with the Family Pet ; and the former being equally disposed to concede the full merit of it to the great Mr. Conkey Chickweed . Meanwhile , Oliver gradually throve and prospered under the united care of Mrs. Maylie , Rose , and the kind - hearted Mr. Losberne . If fervent prayers , gushing from hearts overcharged with gratitude , be heard in heaven — and if they be not , what prayers are!—the blessings which the orphan child called down upon them , sunk into their souls , diffusing peace and happiness . CHAPTER XXXII . OF THE HAPPY LIFE OLIVER BEGAN TO LEAD WITH HIS KIND FRIENDS Oliver ’s ailings were neither slight nor few . In addition to the pain and delay attendant on a broken limb , his exposure to the wet and cold had brought on fever and ague : which hung about him for many weeks , and reduced him sadly . But , at length , he began , by slow degrees , to get better , and to be able to say sometimes , in a few tearful words , how deeply he felt the goodness of the two sweet ladies , and how ardently he hoped that when he grew strong and well again , he could do something to show his gratitude ; only something , which would let them see the love and duty with which his breast was full ; something , however slight , which would prove to them that their gentle kindness had not been cast away ; but that the poor boy whom their charity had rescued from misery , or death , was eager to serve them with his whole heart and soul . “
111537	111562	111534	111535	Poor fellow	4845	” said Rose , when Oliver had been one day feebly endeavouring to utter the words of thankfulness that rose to his pale lips ; “
111634	111635	111618	111618	We	3003	” “
111639	111643	111618	111618	We	3003	” cried Oliver . “
111697	111698	111699	111699	You	4845	” “
111706	111713	111699	111699	You	4845	” said Miss Maylie , smiling ; “
111756	111757	111748	111748	you	4845	” “
111762	111766	111760	111760	ma’am	4840	” cried Oliver ; “
111775	111776	111777	111777	You	4845	” “
111788	111794	111777	111777	You	4845	” replied the young lady . “
111866	111876	111862	111862	you	4845	” she inquired , watching Oliver ’s thoughtful face . “
111884	111889	111862	111862	you	4845	” replied Oliver eagerly ; “
111900	111901	111895	111895	I	0	” “
111905	111911	111895	111895	I	0	” inquired the young lady . “
111932	111936	111918	111921	the dear old nurse	3013	” rejoined Oliver . “
111954	111955	111959	111959	they	3014	” “
111962	111968	111959	111959	they	3014	” rejoined Oliver ’s benefactress ; “
111998	111999	112001	112001	he	238	” “
112005	112015	112001	112001	he	238	” cried Oliver , his face brightening with pleasure . “
112035	112091	112001	112001	he	238	” In a short time Oliver was sufficiently recovered to undergo the fatigue of this expedition . One morning he and Mr. Losberne set out , accordingly , in a little carriage which belonged to Mrs. Maylie . When they came to Chertsey Bridge , Oliver turned very pale , and uttered a loud exclamation . “
112100	112113	112001	112001	he	238	” cried the doctor , as usual , all in a bustle . “
112127	112128	112115	112115	you	0	” “
112133	112144	112131	112131	sir	4543	” cried Oliver , pointing out of the carriage window . “
112148	112149	112131	112131	sir	4543	” “
112165	112170	112159	112159	coachman	3019	” cried the doctor . “
112181	112182	112183	112184	The thieves	1464	” “
112193	112197	112188	112188	they	1464	” whispered Oliver . “
112203	112208	112188	112188	they	1464	” cried the doctor . “
112217	112261	112262	112262	Halloa	249	” But , before the coachman could dismount from his box , he had tumbled out of the coach , by some means or other ; and , running down to the deserted tenement , began kicking at the door like a madman . “
112264	112300	112262	112262	Halloa	249	” said a little ugly hump - backed man : opening the door so suddenly , that the doctor , from the very impetus of his last kick , nearly fell forward into the passage . “
112307	112308	112262	112262	Halloa	249	” “
112311	112325	112262	112262	Halloa	249	” exclaimed the other , collaring him , without a moment ’s reflection . “
112335	112336	112367	112367	you	0	” “
112346	112356	112367	112367	you	0	” replied the hump - backed man , coolly , “
112371	112372	112367	112367	you	0	” “
112377	112389	112375	112375	you	0	” said the doctor , giving his captive a hearty shake . “
112415	112516	112410	112410	Sikes	149	” The hump - backed man stared , as if in excess of amazement and indignation ; then , twisting himself , dexterously , from the doctor ’s grasp , growled forth a volley of horrid oaths , and retired into the house . Before he could shut the door , however , the doctor had passed into the parlour , without a word of parley . He looked anxiously round ; not an article of furniture ; not a vestige of anything , animate or inanimate ; not even the position of the cupboards ; answered Oliver ’s description ! “
112519	112533	112536	112536	you	0	” said the hump - backed man , who had watched him keenly , “
112565	112566	112550	112550	you	0	” “
112590	112596	112571	112572	a man	476	” said the irritable doctor . “
112604	112609	112599	112599	you	0	” demanded the hunchback . “
112626	112627	112617	112617	I	0	” “
112635	112663	112617	112617	I	0	” said Mr. Losberne , looking into the other parlour ; which , like the first , bore no resemblance whatever to Oliver ’s account of it . “
112676	112677	112679	112679	you	0	” “
112681	112689	112679	112679	you	0	” sneered the ill - favoured cripple . “
112736	112764	112730	112730	you	0	” And so saying , the mis - shapen little demon set up a yell , and danced upon the ground , as if wild with rage . “
112770	112777	112730	112730	you	0	” muttered the doctor to himself ; “
112800	112947	112796	112796	yourself	0	” With these words he flung the hunchback a piece of money , and returned to the carriage . The man followed to the chariot door , uttering the wildest imprecations and curses all the way ; but as Mr. Losberne turned to speak to the driver , he looked into the carriage , and eyed Oliver for an instant with a glance so sharp and fierce and at the same time so furious and vindictive , that , waking or sleeping , he could not forget it for months afterwards . He continued to utter the most fearful imprecations , until the driver had resumed his seat ; and when they were once more on their way , they could see him some distance behind : beating his feet upon the ground , and tearing his hair , in transports of real or pretended rage . “
112953	112963	112796	112796	yourself	0	” said the doctor , after a long silence . “
112972	112973	112965	112965	you	0	” “
112978	112979	112965	112965	you	0	” “
112988	112989	112990	112991	An ass	3030	” “
112993	113007	112990	112991	An ass	3030	” said the doctor again , after a further silence of some minutes . “
113107	113320	113323	113323	my	0	” Now , the fact was that the excellent doctor had never acted upon anything but impulse all through his life , and it was no bad compliment to the nature of the impulses which governed him , that so far from being involved in any peculiar troubles or misfortunes , he had the warmest respect and esteem of all who knew him . If the truth must be told , he was a little out of temper , for a minute or two , at being disappointed in procuring corroborative evidence of Oliver ’s story on the very first occasion on which he had a chance of obtaining any . He soon came round again , however ; and finding that Oliver ’s replies to his questions , were still as straightforward and consistent , and still delivered with as much apparent sincerity and truth , as they had ever been , he made up his mind to attach full credence to them , from that time forth . As Oliver knew the name of the street in which Mr. Brownlow resided , they were enabled to drive straight thither . When the coach turned into it , his heart beat so violently , that he could scarcely draw his breath . “
113331	113336	113323	113323	my	0	” inquired Mr. Losberne . “
113341	113352	113323	113323	my	0	” replied Oliver , pointing eagerly out of the window . “
113380	113381	113366	113366	I	0	” “
113386	113398	113366	113366	I	0	” said the good doctor , patting him on the shoulder . “
113417	113418	113406	113406	they	3038	” “
113425	113429	113430	113430	They	3038	” cried Oliver . “
113445	113511	113430	113430	They	3038	” The coach rolled on . It stopped . No ; that was the wrong house ; the next door . It went on a few paces , and stopped again . Oliver looked up at the windows , with tears of happy expectation coursing down his face . Alas ! the white house was empty , and there was a bill in the window . “
113515	113516	113430	113430	They	3038	” “
113523	113535	113430	113430	They	3038	” cried Mr. Losberne , taking Oliver ’s arm in his . “
113556	113606	113540	113541	Mr. Brownlow	173	” The servant did not know ; but would go and inquire . She presently returned , and said , that Mr. Brownlow had sold off his goods , and gone to the West Indies , six weeks before . Oliver clasped his hands , and sank feebly backward . “
113613	113624	113627	113627	sir	4543	” inquired Mr. Losberne , after a moment ’s pause . “
113628	113634	113627	113627	sir	4543	” ; replied the servant . “
113658	113659	113635	113637	The old gentleman	597	” “
113666	113674	113635	113637	The old gentleman	597	” said Mr. Losberne to the driver ; “
113693	113694	113701	113701	sir	4543	” “
113703	113707	113701	113701	sir	4543	” said Oliver . “
113725	113726	113727	113727	My	0	” “
113739	113744	113727	113727	My	0	” said the doctor . “
113790	115902	115903	115903	Rose	237	” And in obedience to the doctor ’s impulse , home they went . This bitter disappointment caused Oliver much sorrow and grief , even in the midst of his happiness ; for he had pleased himself , many times during his illness , with thinking of all that Mr. Brownlow and Mrs. Bedwin would say to him : and what delight it would be to tell them how many long days and nights he had passed in reflecting on what they had done for him , and in bewailing his cruel separation from them . The hope of eventually clearing himself with them , too , and explaining how he had been forced away , had buoyed him up , and sustained him , under many of his recent trials ; and now , the idea that they should have gone so far , and carried with them the belief that he was an impostor and a robber — a belief which might remain uncontradicted to his dying day — was almost more than he could bear . The circumstance occasioned no alteration , however , in the behaviour of his benefactors . After another fortnight , when the fine warm weather had fairly begun , and every tree and flower was putting forth its young leaves and rich blossoms , they made preparations for quitting the house at Chertsey , for some months . Sending the plate , which had so excited Fagin ’s cupidity , to the banker ’s ; and leaving Giles and another servant in care of the house , they departed to a cottage at some distance in the country , and took Oliver with them . Who can describe the pleasure and delight , the peace of mind and soft tranquillity , the sickly boy felt in the balmy air , and among the green hills and rich woods , of an inland village ! Who can tell how scenes of peace and quietude sink into the minds of pain - worn dwellers in close and noisy places , and carry their own freshness , deep into their jaded hearts ! Men who have lived in crowded , pent - up streets , through lives of toil , and who have never wished for change ; men , to whom custom has indeed been second nature , and who have come almost to love each brick and stone that formed the narrow boundaries of their daily walks ; even they , with the hand of death upon them , have been known to yearn at last for one short glimpse of Nature ’s face ; and , carried far from the scenes of their old pains and pleasures , have seemed to pass at once into a new state of being . Crawling forth , from day to day , to some green sunny spot , they have had such memories wakened up within them by the sight of the sky , and hill and plain , and glistening water , that a foretaste of heaven itself has soothed their quick decline , and they have sunk into their tombs , as peacefully as the sun whose setting they watched from their lonely chamber window but a few hours before , faded from their dim and feeble sight ! The memories which peaceful country scenes call up , are not of this world , nor of its thoughts and hopes . Their gentle influence may teach us how to weave fresh garlands for the graves of those we loved : may purify our thoughts , and bear down before it old enmity and hatred ; but beneath all this , there lingers , in the least reflective mind , a vague and half - formed consciousness of having held such feelings long before , in some remote and distant time , which calls up solemn thoughts of distant times to come , and bends down pride and worldliness beneath it . It was a lovely spot to which they repaired . Oliver , whose days had been spent among squalid crowds , and in the midst of noise and brawling , seemed to enter on a new existence there . The rose and honeysuckle clung to the cottage walls ; the ivy crept round the trunks of the trees ; and the garden - flowers perfumed the air with delicious odours . Hard by , was a little churchyard ; not crowded with tall unsightly gravestones , but full of humble mounds , covered with fresh turf and moss : beneath which , the old people of the village lay at rest . Oliver often wandered here ; and , thinking of the wretched grave in which his mother lay , would sometimes sit him down and sob unseen ; but , when he raised his eyes to the deep sky overhead , he would cease to think of her as lying in the ground , and would weep for her , sadly , but without pain . It was a happy time . The days were peaceful and serene ; the nights brought with them neither fear nor care ; no languishing in a wretched prison , or associating with wretched men ; nothing but pleasant and happy thoughts . Every morning he went to a white - headed old gentleman , who lived near the little church : who taught him to read better , and to write : and who spoke so kindly , and took such pains , that Oliver could never try enough to please him . Then , he would walk with Mrs. Maylie and Rose , and hear them talk of books ; or perhaps sit near them , in some shady place , and listen whilst the young lady read : which he could have done , until it grew too dark to see the letters . Then , he had his own lesson for the next day to prepare ; and at this , he would work hard , in a little room which looked into the garden , till evening came slowly on , when the ladies would walk out again , and he with them : listening with such pleasure to all they said : and so happy if they wanted a flower that he could climb to reach , or had forgotten anything he could run to fetch : that he could never be quick enough about it . When it became quite dark , and they returned home , the young lady would sit down to the piano , and play some pleasant air , or sing , in a low and gentle voice , some old song which it pleased her aunt to hear . There would be no candles lighted at such times as these ; and Oliver would sit by one of the windows , listening to the sweet music , in a perfect rapture . And when Sunday came , how differently the day was spent , from any way in which he had ever spent it yet ! and how happily too ; like all the other days in that most happy time ! There was the little church , in the morning , with the green leaves fluttering at the windows : the birds singing without : and the sweet - smelling air stealing in at the low porch , and filling the homely building with its fragrance . The poor people were so neat and clean , and knelt so reverently in prayer , that it seemed a pleasure , not a tedious duty , their assembling there together ; and though the singing might be rude , it was real , and sounded more musical ( to Oliver ’s ears at least ) than any he had ever heard in church before . Then , there were the walks as usual , and many calls at the clean houses of the labouring men ; and at night , Oliver read a chapter or two from the Bible , which he had been studying all the week , and in the performance of which duty he felt more proud and pleased , than if he had been the clergyman himself . In the morning , Oliver would be a - foot by six o’clock , roaming the fields , and plundering the hedges , far and wide , for nosegays of wild flowers , with which he would return laden , home ; and which it took great care and consideration to arrange , to the best advantage , for the embellishment of the breakfast - table . There was fresh groundsel , too , for Miss Maylie ’s birds , with which Oliver , who had been studying the subject under the able tuition of the village clerk , would decorate the cages , in the most approved taste . When the birds were made all spruce and smart for the day , there was usually some little commission of charity to execute in the village ; or , failing that , there was rare cricket - playing , sometimes , on the green ; or , failing that , there was always something to do in the garden , or about the plants , to which Oliver ( who had studied this science also , under the same master , who was a gardener by trade , ) applied himself with hearty good - will , until Miss Rose made her appearance : when there were a thousand commendations to be bestowed on all he had done . So three months glided away ; three months which , in the life of the most blessed and favoured of mortals , might have been unmingled happiness , and which , in Oliver ’s were true felicity . With the purest and most amiable generosity on one side ; and the truest , warmest , soul - felt gratitude on the other ; it is no wonder that , by the end of that short time , Oliver Twist had become completely domesticated with the old lady and her niece , and that the fervent attachment of his young and sensitive heart , was repaid by their pride in , and attachment to , himself . CHAPTER XXXIII . WHEREIN THE HAPPINESS OF OLIVER AND HIS FRIENDS , EXPERIENCES A SUDDEN CHECK Spring flew swiftly by , and summer came . If the village had been beautiful at first it was now in the full glow and luxuriance of its richness . The great trees , which had looked shrunken and bare in the earlier months , had now burst into strong life and health ; and stretching forth their green arms over the thirsty ground , converted open and naked spots into choice nooks , where was a deep and pleasant shade from which to look upon the wide prospect , steeped in sunshine , which lay stretched beyond . The earth had donned her mantle of brightest green ; and shed her richest perfumes abroad . It was the prime and vigour of the year ; all things were glad and flourishing . Still , the same quiet life went on at the little cottage , and the same cheerful serenity prevailed among its inmates . Oliver had long since grown stout and healthy ; but health or sickness made no difference in his warm feelings of a great many people . He was still the same gentle , attached , affectionate creature that he had been when pain and suffering had wasted his strength , and when he was dependent for every slight attention , and comfort on those who tended him . One beautiful night , when they had taken a longer walk than was customary with them : for the day had been unusually warm , and there was a brilliant moon , and a light wind had sprung up , which was unusually refreshing . Rose had been in high spirits , too , and they had walked on , in merry conversation , until they had far exceeded their ordinary bounds . Mrs. Maylie being fatigued , they returned more slowly home . The young lady merely throwing off her simple bonnet , sat down to the piano as usual . After running abstractedly over the keys for a few minutes , she fell into a low and very solemn air ; and as she played it , they heard a sound as if she were weeping . “
115908	115937	115938	115938	Rose	237	” said the elder lady . Rose made no reply , but played a little quicker , as though the words had roused her from some painful thoughts . “
115943	115956	115938	115938	Rose	237	” cried Mrs. Maylie , rising hastily , and bending over her . “
115972	115973	115964	115964	My	0	” “
115980	115986	115964	115964	My	0	” replied the young lady . “
116005	116006	116002	116002	I	0	” “
116013	116018	116002	116002	I	0	” interposed Mrs. Maylie . “
116028	116047	116048	116048	I	0	” replied Rose : shuddering as though some deadly chillness were passing over her , while she spoke ; “
116060	116124	116125	116126	My child	3060	” Oliver hastened to comply with her request . The young lady , making an effort to recover her cheerfulness , strove to play some livelier tune ; but her fingers dropped powerless over the keys . Covering her face with her hands , she sank upon a sofa , and gave vent to the tears which she was now unable to repress . “
116128	116140	116125	116126	My child	3060	” said the elderly lady , folding her arms about her , “
116148	116149	116144	116144	you	3060	” “
116161	116165	116150	116150	I	0	” rejoined Rose ; “
116190	116401	116180	116180	I	0	” She was , indeed ; for , when candles were brought , they saw that in the very short time which had elapsed since their return home , the hue of her countenance had changed to a marble whiteness . Its expression had lost nothing of its beauty ; but it was changed ; and there was an anxious haggard look about the gentle face , which it had never worn before . Another minute , and it was suffused with a crimson flush : and a heavy wildness came over the soft blue eye . Again this disappeared , like the shadow thrown by a passing cloud ; and she was once more deadly pale . Oliver , who watched the old lady anxiously , observed that she was alarmed by these appearances ; and so in truth , was he ; but seeing that she affected to make light of them , he endeavoured to do the same , and they so far succeeded , that when Rose was persuaded by her aunt to retire for the night , she was in better spirits ; and appeared even in better health : assuring them that she felt certain she should rise in the morning , quite well . “
116405	116414	116402	116402	I	0	” said Oliver , when Mrs. Maylie returned , “
116430	116470	116421	116421	She	3062	” The old lady motioned to him not to speak ; and sitting herself down in a dark corner of the room , remained silent for some time . At length , she said , in a trembling voice : “
116513	116514	116506	116506	I	0	” “
116517	116521	116506	116506	I	0	” inquired Oliver . “
116526	116532	116506	116506	I	0	” said the old lady , “
116548	116549	116506	116506	I	0	” “
116555	116561	116506	116506	I	0	” exclaimed Oliver , hastily . “
116569	116579	116566	116567	my child	3060	” said the old lady , wringing her hands . “
116590	116594	116566	116567	my child	3060	” said Oliver . “
116604	116605	116566	116567	my child	3060	” “
116612	116617	116606	116606	She	3062	” rejoined Mrs. Maylie ; “
116642	116689	116637	116637	I	0	” She gave way to such great grief , that Oliver , suppressing his own emotion , ventured to remonstrate with her ; and to beg , earnestly , that , for the sake of the dear young lady herself , she would be more calm . “
116695	116716	116637	116637	I	0	” said Oliver , as the tears forced themselves into his eyes , despite of his efforts to the contrary . “
116790	116791	116818	116818	you	3067	” “
116794	116807	116818	116818	you	3067	” said Mrs. Maylie , laying her hand on Oliver ’s head . “
116954	117109	116949	116949	He	171	” Oliver was surprised to see that as Mrs. Maylie said these words , she checked her lamentations as though by one effort ; and drawing herself up as she spoke , became composed and firm . He was still more astonished to find that this firmness lasted ; and that , under all the care and watching which ensued , Mrs. Maylie was ever ready and collected : performing all the duties which had devolved upon her , steadily , and , to all external appearances , even cheerfully . But he was young , and did not know what strong minds are capable of , under trying circumstances . How should he , when their possessors so seldom know themselves ? An anxious night ensued . When morning came , Mrs. Maylie ’s predictions were but too well verified . Rose was in the first stage of a high and dangerous fever . “
117125	117145	116949	116949	He	171	” said Mrs. Maylie , laying her finger on her lip , as she looked steadily into his face ; “
117226	117243	117223	117223	I	0	” Oliver could make no reply , but looked his anxiety to be gone at once . “
117249	117258	117223	117223	I	0	” said Mrs. Maylie , pausing to reflect ; “
117292	117293	117280	117280	I	0	” “
117303	117323	117301	117301	ma’am	4840	” inquired Oliver ; impatient to execute his commission , and holding out his trembling hand for the letter . “
117326	117373	117301	117301	ma’am	4840	” replied the old lady , giving it to him mechanically . Oliver glanced at it , and saw that it was directed to Harry Maylie , Esquire , at some great lord ’s house in the country ; where , he could not make out . “
117380	117389	117390	117390	I	0	” asked Oliver , looking up , impatiently . “
117394	117403	117390	117390	I	0	” replied Mrs. Maylie , taking it back . “
117410	117585	117404	117404	I	0	” With these words , she gave Oliver her purse , and he started off , without more delay , at the greatest speed he could muster . Swiftly he ran across the fields , and down the little lanes which sometimes divided them : now almost hidden by the high corn on either side , and now emerging on an open field , where the mowers and haymakers were busy at their work : nor did he stop once , save now and then , for a few seconds , to recover breath , until he came , in a great heat , and covered with dust , on the little market - place of the market - town . Here he paused , and looked about for the inn . There were a white bank , and a red brewery , and a yellow town - hall ; and in one corner there was a large house , with all the wood about it painted green : before which was the sign of “
117589	117914	117404	117404	I	0	” To this he hastened , as soon as it caught his eye . He spoke to a postboy who was dozing under the gateway ; and who , after hearing what he wanted , referred him to the ostler ; who after hearing all he had to say again , referred him to the landlord ; who was a tall gentleman in a blue neckcloth , a white hat , drab breeches , and boots with tops to match , leaning against a pump by the stable - door , picking his teeth with a silver toothpick . This gentleman walked with much deliberation into the bar to make out the bill : which took a long time making out : and after it was ready , and paid , a horse had to be saddled , and a man to be dressed , which took up ten good minutes more . Meanwhile Oliver was in such a desperate state of impatience and anxiety , that he felt as if he could have jumped upon the horse himself , and galloped away , full tear , to the next stage . At length , all was ready ; and the little parcel having been handed up , with many injunctions and entreaties for its speedy delivery , the man set spurs to his horse , and rattling over the uneven paving of the market - place , was out of the town , and galloping along the turnpike - road , in a couple of minutes . As it was something to feel certain that assistance was sent for , and that no time had been lost , Oliver hurried up the inn - yard , with a somewhat lighter heart . He was turning out of the gateway when he accidently stumbled against a tall man wrapped in a cloak , who was at that moment coming out of the inn door . “
117917	117932	117404	117404	I	0	” cried the man , fixing his eyes on Oliver , and suddenly recoiling . “
117939	117940	117941	117941	I	0	” “
117948	117952	117946	117946	sir	4543	” said Oliver ; “
117971	117972	117973	117973	Death	251	” “
117975	117992	117973	117973	Death	251	” muttered the man to himself , glaring at the boy with his large dark eyes . “
118019	118020	118004	118004	He	3087	” “
118025	118038	118021	118021	I	0	” stammered Oliver , confused by the strange man ’s wild look . “
118047	118048	118041	118041	I	0	” “
118052	118067	118050	118050	you	0	” murmured the man , in a horrible passion ; between his clenched teeth ; “
118112	118342	118108	118108	you	0	” The man shook his fist , as he uttered these words incoherently . He advanced towards Oliver , as if with the intention of aiming a blow at him , but fell violently on the ground : writhing and foaming , in a fit . Oliver gazed , for a moment , at the struggles of the madman ( for such he supposed him to be ) ; and then darted into the house for help . Having seen him safely carried into the hotel , he turned his face homewards , running as fast as he could , to make up for lost time : and recalling with a great deal of astonishment and some fear , the extraordinary behaviour of the person from whom he had just parted . The circumstance did not dwell in his recollection long , however : for when he reached the cottage , there was enough to occupy his mind , and to drive all considerations of self completely from his memory . Rose Maylie had rapidly grown worse ; before mid - night she was delirious . A medical practitioner , who resided on the spot , was in constant attendance upon her ; and after first seeing the patient , he had taken Mrs. Maylie aside , and pronounced her disorder to be one of a most alarming nature . “
118346	118350	118108	118108	you	0	” he said , “
118364	118720	118108	118108	you	0	” How often did Oliver start from his bed that night , and stealing out , with noiseless footstep , to the staircase , listen for the slightest sound from the sick chamber ! How often did a tremble shake his frame , and cold drops of terror start upon his brow , when a sudden trampling of feet caused him to fear that something too dreadful to think of , had even then occurred ! And what had been the fervency of all the prayers he had ever muttered , compared with those he poured forth , now , in the agony and passion of his supplication for the life and health of the gentle creature , who was tottering on the deep grave ’s verge ! Oh ! the suspense , the fearful , acute suspense , of standing idly by while the life of one we dearly love , is trembling in the balance ! Oh ! the racking thoughts that crowd upon the mind , and make the heart beat violently , and the breath come thick , by the force of the images they conjure up before it ; the desperate anxiety _ to be doing something _ to relieve the pain , or lessen the danger , which we have no power to alleviate ; the sinking of soul and spirit , which the sad remembrance of our helplessness produces ; what tortures can equal these ; what reflections or endeavours can , in the full tide and fever of the time , allay them ! Morning came ; and the little cottage was lonely and still . People spoke in whispers ; anxious faces appeared at the gate , from time to time ; women and children went away in tears . All the livelong day , and for hours after it had grown dark , Oliver paced softly up and down the garden , raising his eyes every instant to the sick chamber , and shuddering to see the darkened window , looking as if death lay stretched inside . Late that night , Mr. Losberne arrived . “
118725	118737	118108	118108	you	0	” said the good doctor , turning away as he spoke ; “
118752	119399	118108	118108	you	0	” Another morning . The sun shone brightly ; as brightly as if it looked upon no misery or care ; and , with every leaf and flower in full bloom about her ; with life , and health , and sounds and sights of joy , surrounding her on every side : the fair young creature lay , wasting fast . Oliver crept away to the old churchyard , and sitting down on one of the green mounds , wept and prayed for her , in silence . There was such peace and beauty in the scene ; so much of brightness and mirth in the sunny landscape ; such blithesome music in the songs of the summer birds ; such freedom in the rapid flight of the rook , careering overhead ; so much of life and joyousness in all ; that , when the boy raised his aching eyes , and looked about , the thought instinctively occurred to him , that this was not a time for death ; that Rose could surely never die when humbler things were all so glad and gay ; that graves were for cold and cheerless winter : not for sunlight and fragrance . He almost thought that shrouds were for the old and shrunken ; and that they never wrapped the young and graceful form in their ghastly folds . A knell from the church bell broke harshly on these youthful thoughts . Another ! Again ! It was tolling for the funeral service . A group of humble mourners entered the gate : wearing white favours ; for the corpse was young . They stood uncovered by a grave ; and there was a mother — a mother once — among the weeping train . But the sun shone brightly , and the birds sang on . Oliver turned homeward , thinking on the many kindnesses he had received from the young lady , and wishing that the time could come again , that he might never cease showing her how grateful and attached he was . He had no cause for self - reproach on the score of neglect , or want of thought , for he had been devoted to her service ; and yet a hundred little occasions rose up before him , on which he fancied he might have been more zealous , and more earnest , and wished he had been . We need be careful how we deal with those about us , when every death carries to some small circle of survivors , thoughts of so much omitted , and so little done — of so many things forgotten , and so many more which might have been repaired ! There is no remorse so deep as that which is unavailing ; if we would be spared its tortures , let us remember this , in time . When he reached home Mrs. Maylie was sitting in the little parlour . Oliver ’s heart sank at sight of her ; for she had never left the bedside of her niece ; and he trembled to think what change could have driven her away . He learnt that she had fallen into a deep sleep , from which she would waken , either to recovery and life , or to bid them farewell , and die . They sat , listening , and afraid to speak , for hours . The untasted meal was removed , with looks which showed that their thoughts were elsewhere , they watched the sun as he sank lower and lower , and , at length , cast over sky and earth those brilliant hues which herald his departure . Their quick ears caught the sound of an approaching footstep . They both involuntarily darted to the door , as Mr. Losberne entered . “
119404	119410	119402	119402	Rose	252	” cried the old lady . “
119436	119437	119438	119438	You	0	” “
119443	119450	119438	119438	You	0	” said the doctor supporting her . “
119460	119461	119467	119467	God	171	” “
119483	119484	119479	119479	She	252	” “
119487	119494	119479	119479	She	252	” cried the doctor , passionately . “
119515	119890	119502	119502	she	252	” The lady fell upon her knees , and tried to fold her hands together ; but the energy which had supported her so long , fled up to Heaven with her first thanksgiving ; and she sank into the friendly arms which were extended to receive her . CHAPTER XXXIV . CONTAINS SOME INTRODUCTORY PARTICULARS RELATIVE TO A YOUNG GENTLEMAN WHO NOW ARRIVES UPON THE SCENE ; AND A NEW ADVENTURE WHICH HAPPENED TO OLIVER It was almost too much happiness to bear . Oliver felt stunned and stupefied by the unexpected intelligence ; he could not weep , or speak , or rest . He had scarcely the power of understanding anything that had passed , until , after a long ramble in the quiet evening air , a burst of tears came to his relief , and he seemed to awaken , all at once , to a full sense of the joyful change that had occurred , and the almost insupportable load of anguish which had been taken from his breast . The night was fast closing in , when he returned homeward : laden with flowers which he had culled , with peculiar care , for the adornment of the sick chamber . As he walked briskly along the road , he heard behind him , the noise of some vehicle , approaching at a furious pace . Looking round , he saw that it was a post - chaise , driven at great speed ; and as the horses were galloping , and the road was narrow , he stood leaning against a gate until it should have passed him . As it dashed on , Oliver caught a glimpse of a man in a white nightcap , whose face seemed familiar to him , although his view was so brief that he could not identify the person . In another second or two , the nightcap was thrust out of the chaise - window , and a stentorian voice bellowed to the driver to stop : which he did , as soon as he could pull up his horses . Then , the nightcap once again appeared : and the same voice called Oliver by his name . “
119893	119898	119502	119502	she	252	” cried the voice . “
119916	119917	119909	119914	Master O - li - ver	3093	” “
119924	119977	119920	119920	you	3094	” cried Oliver , running up to the chaise - door . Giles popped out his nightcap again , preparatory to making some reply , when he was suddenly pulled back by a young gentleman who occupied the other corner of the chaise , and who eagerly demanded what was the news . “
119982	119987	119920	119920	you	3094	” cried the gentleman , “
119992	119993	119920	119920	you	3094	” “
119999	120005	119920	119920	you	3094	” replied Oliver , hastily . “
120009	120014	119920	119920	you	3094	” exclaimed the gentleman . “
120019	120020	120015	120015	You	123	” “
120025	120029	120023	120023	sir	4543	” replied Oliver . “
120053	120084	120041	120042	Mr. Losberne	238	” The gentleman said not another word , but , opening the chaise - door , leaped out , and taking Oliver hurriedly by the arm , led him aside . “
120107	120116	120085	120085	You	123	” demanded the gentleman in a tremulous voice . “
120132	120133	120085	120085	You	123	” “
120143	120147	120134	120134	I	0	” replied Oliver . “
120180	120343	120176	120176	him	238	” The tears stood in Oliver ’s eyes as he recalled the scene which was the beginning of so much happiness ; and the gentleman turned his face away , and remained silent , for some minutes . Oliver thought he heard him sob , more than once ; but he feared to interrupt him by any fresh remark — for he could well guess what his feelings were — and so stood apart , feigning to be occupied with his nosegay . All this time , Mr. Giles , with the white nightcap on , had been sitting on the steps of the chaise , supporting an elbow on each knee , and wiping his eyes with a blue cotton pocket - handkerchief dotted with white spots . That the honest fellow had not been feigning emotion , was abundantly demonstrated by the very red eyes with which he regarded the young gentleman , when he turned round and addressed him . “
120361	120365	120359	120359	Giles	233	” said he . “
120392	120393	120385	120385	You	3101	” “
120402	120418	120399	120400	Mr. Harry	254	” said Giles : giving a final polish to his ruffled countenance with the handkerchief ; “
120469	120470	120445	120446	the maids	3104	” “
120473	120480	120485	120485	you	3101	” rejoined Harry Maylie , smiling , “
120527	120710	120711	120711	Mother	256	” Mr. Giles , reminded of his unbecoming costume , snatched off and pocketed his nightcap ; and substituted a hat , of grave and sober shape , which he took out of the chaise . This done , the postboy drove off ; Giles , Mr. Maylie , and Oliver , followed at their leisure . As they walked along , Oliver glanced from time to time with much interest and curiosity at the new comer . He seemed about five - and - twenty years of age , and was of the middle height ; his countenance was frank and handsome ; and his demeanor easy and prepossessing . Notwithstanding the difference between youth and age , he bore so strong a likeness to the old lady , that Oliver would have had no great difficulty in imagining their relationship , if he had not already spoken of her as his mother . Mrs. Maylie was anxiously waiting to receive her son when he reached the cottage . The meeting did not take place without great emotion on both sides . “
120713	120719	120711	120711	Mother	256	” whispered the young man ; “
120727	120728	120729	120729	I	0	” “
120732	120737	120729	120729	I	0	” replied Mrs. Maylie ; “

121074	121086	121067	121067	I	0	” returned Mrs. Maylie , laying her hand upon his shoulder , “
121121	121135	121119	121119	I	0	” said the lady , fixing her eyes on her son ’s face , “
121249	121250	121237	121237	she	3119	” “
121253	121261	121237	121237	she	3119	” said the young man , impatiently , “
121287	121288	121265	121267	a selfish brute	3123	” “
121296	121301	121289	121289	You	4602	” replied his mother . “

121510	121514	121506	121506	Rose	237	” interposed Harry . “

121543	121548	121539	121539	I	0	” rejoined Mrs. Maylie ; “
121556	121557	121558	121558	I	0	” “
121564	121570	121571	121571	Mother	4602	” was the impatient reply ; “
121642	121643	121644	121644	She	237	” “
121647	121652	121644	121644	She	237	” said Mrs. Maylie . “
121673	121679	121671	121671	mother	4602	” said the young man . “
121683	121689	121665	121665	she	237	” rejoined the old lady ; “
121694	121695	121665	121665	she	237	” “
121699	121705	121665	121665	she	237	” urged the young man . “
121713	121714	121706	121706	She	237	” “
121719	121724	121725	121725	you	0	” replied his mother ; “
121746	121762	121742	121742	I	0	” resumed the old lady , stopping her son as he was about to speak , “
121859	121860	121863	121863	you	0	” “
121866	121867	121863	121863	you	0	” “
121875	121880	121869	121869	I	0	” replied Mrs. Maylie . “

121901	121909	121890	121890	you	0	” said the young man , eagerly . “
121914	121919	121890	121890	you	0	” replied the lady ; “
121925	121926	121927	121927	You	0	” “
121935	121939	121927	121927	You	0	” said Harry . “
121943	121948	121927	121927	You	0	” replied Mrs. Maylie . “
121982	121983	121980	121980	mother	4602	” “
121986	121992	121993	121993	I	0	” said the old lady ; “
121999	122121	121993	121993	I	0	” And pressing her son ’s hand , affectionately , she hastened from the room . Mr. Losberne and Oliver had remained at another end of the apartment while this hurried conversation was proceeding . The former now held out his hand to Harry Maylie ; and hearty salutations were exchanged between them . The doctor then communicated , in reply to multifarious questions from his young friend , a precise account of his patient ’s situation ; which was quite as consolatory and full of promise , as Oliver ’s statement had encouraged him to hope ; and to the whole of which , Mr. Giles , who affected to be busy about the luggage , listened with greedy ears . “
122132	122142	122123	122123	you	3138	” inquired the doctor , when he had concluded . “
122148	122159	122123	122123	you	3138	” replied Mr. Giles , colouring up to the eyes . “
122172	122177	122182	122182	sir	4543	” said the doctor . “
122184	122193	122182	122182	sir	4543	” replied Mr. Giles , with much gravity . “
122196	122201	122202	122202	I	0	” said the doctor , “
122224	122225	122222	122222	Brittles	234	” “
122234	122246	122232	122232	sir	4543	” said Mr. Giles , recovering his usual tone of patronage ; “
122255	122256	122253	122253	sir	4543	” “
122261	122266	122253	122253	sir	4543	” said the doctor . “
122321	122498	122319	122319	you	3138	” Mr. Giles walked into the corner with much importance , and some wonder , and was honoured with a short whispering conference with the doctor , on the termination of which , he made a great many bows , and retired with steps of unusual stateliness . The subject matter of this conference was not disclosed in the parlour , but the kitchen was speedily enlightened concerning it ; for Mr. Giles walked straight thither , and having called for a mug of ale , announced , with an air of majesty , which was highly effective , that it had pleased his mistress , in consideration of his gallant behaviour on the occasion of that attempted robbery , to deposit , in the local savings - bank , the sum of five - and - twenty pounds , for his sole use and benefit . At this , the two women - servants lifted up their hands and eyes , and supposed that Mr. Giles , pulling out his shirt - frill , replied , “
122502	123851	122319	122319	you	3138	” ; and that if they observed that he was at all haughty to his inferiors , he would thank them to tell him so . And then he made a great many other remarks , no less illustrative of his humility , which were received with equal favour and applause , and were , withal , as original and as much to the purpose , as the remarks of great men commonly are . Above stairs , the remainder of the evening passed cheerfully away ; for the doctor was in high spirits ; and however fatigued or thoughtful Harry Maylie might have been at first , he was not proof against the worthy gentleman ’s good humour , which displayed itself in a great variety of sallies and professional recollections , and an abundance of small jokes , which struck Oliver as being the drollest things he had ever heard , and caused him to laugh proportionately ; to the evident satisfaction of the doctor , who laughed immoderately at himself , and made Harry laugh almost as heartily , by the very force of sympathy . So , they were as pleasant a party as , under the circumstances , they could well have been ; and it was late before they retired , with light and thankful hearts , to take that rest of which , after the doubt and suspense they had recently undergone , they stood much in need . Oliver rose next morning , in better heart , and went about his usual occupations , with more hope and pleasure than he had known for many days . The birds were once more hung out , to sing , in their old places ; and the sweetest wild flowers that could be found , were once more gathered to gladden Rose with their beauty . The melancholy which had seemed to the sad eyes of the anxious boy to hang , for days past , over every object , beautiful as all were , was dispelled by magic . The dew seemed to sparkle more brightly on the green leaves ; the air to rustle among them with a sweeter music ; and the sky itself to look more blue and bright . Such is the influence which the condition of our own thoughts , exercise , even over the appearance of external objects . Men who look on nature , and their fellow - men , and cry that all is dark and gloomy , are in the right ; but the sombre colours are reflections from their own jaundiced eyes and hearts . The real hues are delicate , and need a clearer vision . It is worthy of remark , and Oliver did not fail to note it at the time , that his morning expeditions were no longer made alone . Harry Maylie , after the very first morning when he met Oliver coming laden home , was seized with such a passion for flowers , and displayed such a taste in their arrangement , as left his young companion far behind . If Oliver were behindhand in these respects , he knew where the best were to be found ; and morning after morning they scoured the country together , and brought home the fairest that blossomed . The window of the young lady ’s chamber was opened now ; for she loved to feel the rich summer air stream in , and revive her with its freshness ; but there always stood in water , just inside the lattice , one particular little bunch , which was made up with great care , every morning . Oliver could not help noticing that the withered flowers were never thrown away , although the little vase was regularly replenished ; nor , could he help observing , that whenever the doctor came into the garden , he invariably cast his eyes up to that particular corner , and nodded his head most expressively , as he set forth on his morning ’s walk . Pending these observations , the days were flying by ; and Rose was rapidly recovering . Nor did Oliver ’s time hang heavy on his hands , although the young lady had not yet left her chamber , and there were no evening walks , save now and then , for a short distance , with Mrs. Maylie . He applied himself , with redoubled assiduity , to the instructions of the white - headed old gentleman , and laboured so hard that his quick progress surprised even himself . It was while he was engaged in this pursuit , that he was greatly startled and distressed by a most unexpected occurrence . The little room in which he was accustomed to sit , when busy at his books , was on the ground - floor , at the back of the house . It was quite a cottage - room , with a lattice - window : around which were clusters of jessamine and honeysuckle , that crept over the casement , and filled the place with their delicious perfume . It looked into a garden , whence a wicket - gate opened into a small paddock ; all beyond , was fine meadow - land and wood . There was no other dwelling near , in that direction ; and the prospect it commanded was very extensive . One beautiful evening , when the first shades of twilight were beginning to settle upon the earth , Oliver sat at this window , intent upon his books . He had been poring over them for some time ; and , as the day had been uncommonly sultry , and he had exerted himself a great deal , it is no disparagement to the authors , whoever they may have been , to say , that gradually and by slow degrees , he fell asleep . There is a kind of sleep that steals upon us sometimes , which , while it holds the body prisoner , does not free the mind from a sense of things about it , and enable it to ramble at its pleasure . So far as an overpowering heaviness , a prostration of strength , and an utter inability to control our thoughts or power of motion , can be called sleep , this is it ; and yet , we have a consciousness of all that is going on about us , and , if we dream at such a time , words which are really spoken , or sounds which really exist at the moment , accommodate themselves with surprising readiness to our visions , until reality and imagination become so strangely blended that it is afterwards almost matter of impossibility to separate the two . Nor is this , the most striking phenomenon incidental to such a state . It is an undoubted fact , that although our senses of touch and sight be for the time dead , yet our sleeping thoughts , and the visionary scenes that pass before us , will be influenced and materially influenced , by the _ mere silent presence _ of some external object ; which may not have been near us when we closed our eyes : and of whose vicinity we have had no waking consciousness . Oliver knew , perfectly well , that he was in his own little room ; that his books were lying on the table before him ; that the sweet air was stirring among the creeping plants outside . And yet he was asleep . Suddenly , the scene changed ; the air became close and confined ; and he thought , with a glow of terror , that he was in the Jew ’s house again . There sat the hideous old man , in his accustomed corner , pointing at him , and whispering to another man , with his face averted , who sat beside him . “
123857	123866	123869	123869	he	3148	” he thought he heard the Jew say ; “
123877	123878	123879	123879	He	3148	” “
123881	123889	123896	123896	you	0	” the other man seemed to answer ; “
123967	124248	124249	124250	The Jew	1184	” The man seemed to say this , with such dreadful hatred , that Oliver awoke with the fear , and started up . Good Heaven ! what was that , which sent the blood tingling to his heart , and deprived him of his voice , and of power to move ! There — there — at the window — close before him — so close , that he could have almost touched him before he started back : with his eyes peering into the room , and meeting his : there stood the Jew ! And beside him , white with rage or fear , or both , were the scowling features of the man who had accosted him in the inn - yard . It was but an instant , a glance , a flash , before his eyes ; and they were gone . But they had recognised him , and he them ; and their look was as firmly impressed upon his memory , as if it had been deeply carved in stone , and set before him from his birth . He stood transfixed for a moment ; then , leaping from the window into the garden , called loudly for help . CHAPTER XXXV . CONTAINING THE UNSATISFACTORY RESULT OF OLIVER ’S ADVENTURE ; AND A CONVERSATION OF SOME IMPORTANCE BETWEEN HARRY MAYLIE AND ROSE When the inmates of the house , attracted by Oliver ’s cries , hurried to the spot from which they proceeded , they found him , pale and agitated , pointing in the direction of the meadows behind the house , and scarcely able to articulate the words , “
124255	124295	124252	124253	the Jew	1184	” Mr. Giles was at a loss to comprehend what this outcry meant ; but Harry Maylie , whose perceptions were something quicker , and who had heard Oliver ’s history from his mother , understood it at once . “
124302	124318	124252	124253	the Jew	1184	” he asked , catching up a heavy stick which was standing in a corner . “
124321	124334	124252	124253	the Jew	1184	” replied Oliver , pointing out the course the man had taken ; “
124342	124343	124335	124335	I	0	” “
124352	124356	124335	124335	I	0	” said Harry . “
124369	124681	124366	124366	you	3156	” So saying , he sprang over the hedge , and darted off with a speed which rendered it matter of exceeding difficulty for the others to keep near him . Giles followed as well as he could ; and Oliver followed too ; and in the course of a minute or two , Mr. Losberne , who had been out walking , and just then returned , tumbled over the hedge after them , and picking himself up with more agility than he could have been supposed to possess , struck into the same course at no contemptible speed , shouting all the while , most prodigiously , to know what was the matter . On they all went ; nor stopped they once to breathe , until the leader , striking off into an angle of the field indicated by Oliver , began to search , narrowly , the ditch and hedge adjoining ; which afforded time for the remainder of the party to come up ; and for Oliver to communicate to Mr. Losberne the circumstances that had led to so vigorous a pursuit . The search was all in vain . There were not even the traces of recent footsteps , to be seen . They stood now , on the summit of a little hill , commanding the open fields in every direction for three or four miles . There was the village in the hollow on the left ; but , in order to gain that , after pursuing the track Oliver had pointed out , the men must have made a circuit of open ground , which it was impossible they could have accomplished in so short a time . A thick wood skirted the meadow - land in another direction ; but they could not have gained that covert for the same reason . “
124691	124696	124689	124689	Oliver	123	” said Harry Maylie . “
124704	124720	124702	124702	sir	4543	” replied Oliver , shuddering at the very recollection of the old wretch ’s countenance ; “
124742	124743	124729	124729	I	0	” “
124749	124758	124746	124747	the other	591	” inquired Harry and Mr. Losberne , together . “
124778	124782	124783	124783	We	3162	” said Oliver . “
124800	124801	124802	124802	They	3158	” “
124807	124811	124813	124813	you	123	” demanded Harry : “
124816	124817	124813	124813	you	123	” “
124829	124853	124822	124823	the men	7230	” replied Oliver , pointing down , as he spoke , to the hedge which divided the cottage - garden from the meadow . “
124880	124998	124864	124873	the Jew , running a few paces to the right	3166	” The two gentlemen watched Oliver ’s earnest face , as he spoke , and looking from him to each other , seemed to feel satisfied of the accuracy of what he said . Still , in no direction were there any appearances of the trampling of men in hurried flight . The grass was long ; but it was trodden down nowhere , save where their own feet had crushed it . The sides and brinks of the ditches were of damp clay ; but in no one place could they discern the print of men ’s shoes , or the slightest mark which would indicate that any feet had pressed the ground for hours before . “
125003	125007	124864	124873	the Jew , running a few paces to the right	3166	” said Harry . “
125010	125015	125016	125016	Blathers	244	” echoed the doctor . “
125028	125424	125018	125018	Duff	243	” Notwithstanding the evidently useless nature of their search , they did not desist until the coming on of night rendered its further prosecution hopeless ; and even then , they gave it up with reluctance . Giles was dispatched to the different ale - houses in the village , furnished with the best description Oliver could give of the appearance and dress of the strangers . Of these , the Jew was , at all events , sufficiently remarkable to be remembered , supposing he had been seen drinking , or loitering about ; but Giles returned without any intelligence , calculated to dispel or lessen the mystery . On the next day , fresh search was made , and the inquiries renewed ; but with no better success . On the day following , Oliver and Mr. Maylie repaired to the market - town , in the hope of seeing or hearing something of the men there ; but this effort was equally fruitless . After a few days , the affair began to be forgotten , as most affairs are , when wonder , having no fresh food to support it , dies away of itself . Meanwhile , Rose was rapidly recovering . She had left her room : was able to go out ; and mixing once more with the family , carried joy into the hearts of all . But , although this happy change had a visible effect on the little circle ; and although cheerful voices and merry laughter were once more heard in the cottage ; there was at times , an unwonted restraint upon some there : even upon Rose herself : which Oliver could not fail to remark . Mrs. Maylie and her son were often closeted together for a long time ; and more than once Rose appeared with traces of tears upon her face . After Mr. Losberne had fixed a day for his departure to Chertsey , these symptoms increased ; and it became evident that something was in progress which affected the peace of the young lady , and of somebody else besides . At length , one morning , when Rose was alone in the breakfast - parlour , Harry Maylie entered ; and , with some hesitation , begged permission to speak with her for a few moments . “
125437	125449	125435	125435	Rose	237	” said the young man , drawing his chair towards her . “
125489	125535	125536	125536	I	0	” Rose had been very pale from the moment of his entrance ; but that might have been the effect of her recent illness . She merely bowed ; and bending over some plants that stood near , waited in silence for him to proceed . “
125548	125552	125553	125553	You	0	” said Harry . “
125558	125562	125553	125553	You	0	” replied Rose . “
125575	125576	125577	125577	I	0	” “
125592	125598	125553	125553	You	0	” said the young man ; “
125681	125746	125747	125748	A creature	3177	” There were tears in the eyes of the gentle girl , as these words were spoken ; and when one fell upon the flower over which she bent , and glistened brightly in its cup , making it more beautiful , it seemed as though the outpouring of her fresh young heart , claimed kindred naturally , with the loveliest things in nature . “
125750	125758	125747	125748	A creature	3177	” continued the young man , passionately , “
126066	126067	126068	126068	I	0	” “
126074	126080	126068	126068	I	0	” said Rose , weeping ; “
126108	126109	126150	126150	Rose	237	” “
126139	126149	126150	126150	Rose	237	” said the young man , taking her hand . “
126289	126290	126291	126291	Your	237	” “
126300	126313	126315	126315	you	237	” said Rose , mastering the emotions by which she was agitated . “
126330	126331	126327	126327	my	0	” “
126349	126350	126347	126347	Rose	237	” “
126354	126358	126360	126360	you	237	” replied Rose , “
126438	126471	126473	126473	your	237	” There was a pause , during which , Rose , who had covered her face with one hand , gave free vent to her tears . Harry still retained the other . “
126478	126490	126473	126473	your	237	” he said , at length , in a low voice ; “
126497	126498	126473	126473	your	237	” “
126507	126511	126512	126512	You	237	” rejoined Rose . “
126542	126543	126545	126545	yourself	237	” “
126547	126548	126545	126545	yourself	237	” “
126640	126641	126643	126643	your	250	” “
126652	126656	126657	126657	They	3201	” Harry began . “
126661	126668	126657	126657	They	3201	” replied Rose , colouring deeply . “
126675	126679	126643	126643	your	250	” said Harry . “
126700	126701	126643	126643	your	250	” “
126718	126722	126723	126723	I	0	” rejoined Rose , “
126727	126728	126723	126723	I	0	” “
126736	126740	126723	126723	I	0	” said Harry . “
126753	126754	126755	126755	I	0	” “
126758	126762	126755	126755	I	0	” said Rose . “
126765	126773	126723	126723	I	0	” she added , disengaging her hand , “
126903	126904	126908	126908	Rose	237	” “
126910	126914	126915	126915	Your	237	” said Harry . “
126932	126933	126928	126928	me	0	” “
126939	126945	126928	126928	me	0	” answered Rose , firmly , “
127023	127039	127056	127056	I	0	” said the young lady , turning away , as her temporary firmness forsook her , “
127076	127077	127082	127082	Rose	237	” “
127090	127099	127085	127085	Rose	237	” cried Harry , throwing himself before her . “
127159	127160	127197	127197	your	237	” “
127168	127172	127197	127197	your	237	” answered Rose . “
127194	127195	127197	127197	your	237	” “
127209	127213	127201	127201	I	0	” retorted Harry , “
127301	127302	127296	127296	me	0	” “
127313	127317	127296	127296	me	0	” rejoined Rose ; “
127400	127449	127450	127450	I	0	” Busy recollections of old hopes , cherished as a girl , long ago , crowded into the mind of Rose , while making this avowal ; but they brought tears with them , as old hopes will when they come back withered ; and they relieved her . “
127464	127472	127450	127450	I	0	” said Rose , extending her hand . “
127481	127482	127483	127483	I	0	” “
127488	127492	127483	127483	I	0	” said Harry . “
127523	127524	127566	127566	you	0	” “
127535	127544	127566	127566	you	0	” replied Rose , with a melancholy smile ; “
127550	127551	127561	127561	you	0	” “
127554	127558	127561	127561	you	0	” said Harry ; “
127612	127613	127591	127591	you	0	” “
127620	127624	127591	127591	you	0	” rejoined Rose ; “
127646	127723	127726	127726	you	0	” She extended her hand again . But the young man caught her to his bosom ; and imprinting one kiss on her beautiful forehead , hurried from the room . CHAPTER XXXVI . IS A VERY SHORT ONE , AND MAY APPEAR OF NO GREAT IMPORTANCE IN ITS PLACE , BUT IT SHOULD BE READ NOTWITHSTANDING , AS A SEQUEL TO THE LAST , AND A KEY TO ONE THAT WILL FOLLOW WHEN ITS TIME ARRIVES “
127739	127757	127726	127726	you	0	” said the doctor , as Harry Maylie joined him and Oliver at the breakfast - table . “
127775	127776	127777	127777	You	0	” “
127789	127799	127777	127777	You	0	” said Harry , colouring without any perceptible reason . “
127811	127816	127802	127802	I	0	” replied Mr. Losberne ; “
127952	127953	127950	127950	Oliver	123	” “
127976	127980	127974	127974	sir	4543	” rejoined Oliver . “
127987	127992	127983	127985	a fine fellow	3222	” said the doctor ; “
128029	128030	128031	128033	The great nobs	3223	” “
128035	128039	128031	128033	The great nobs	3223	” replied Harry , “
128093	128094	128112	128112	they	3223	” “
128097	128102	128112	128112	they	3223	” said the doctor , “
128162	128198	128199	128199	We	3228	” Harry Maylie looked as if he could have followed up this short dialogue by one or two remarks that would have staggered the doctor not a little ; but he contented himself with saying , “
128203	128242	128243	128243	Oliver	123	” and pursued the subject no farther . The post - chaise drove up to the door shortly afterwards ; and Giles coming in for the luggage , the good doctor bustled out , to see it packed . “
128245	128255	128243	128243	Oliver	123	” said Harry Maylie , in a low voice , “
128264	128296	128257	128257	me	0	” Oliver walked into the window - recess to which Mr. Maylie beckoned him ; much surprised at the mixture of sadness and boisterous spirits , which his whole behaviour displayed . “
128303	128314	128257	128257	me	0	” said Harry , laying his hand upon his arm . “
128321	128325	128319	128319	sir	4543	” replied Oliver . “
128369	128370	128367	128367	you	4543	” “
128385	128395	128377	128377	I	0	” exclaimed Oliver , greatly delighted with the commission . “
128411	128417	128419	128419	you	4543	” said the young man ; “
128458	128459	128456	128456	me	0	” “
128468	128472	128456	128456	me	0	” replied Oliver . “
128484	128493	128476	128476	you	4543	” said Harry , hurrying over his words ; “
128539	128638	128534	128534	I	0	” Oliver , quite elated and honoured by a sense of his importance , faithfully promised to be secret and explicit in his communications . Mr. Maylie took leave of him , with many assurances of his regard and protection . The doctor was in the chaise ; Giles ( who , it had been arranged , should be left behind ) held the door open in his hand ; and the women - servants were in the garden , looking on . Harry cast one slight glance at the latticed window , and jumped into the carriage . “
128642	128646	128534	128534	I	0	” he cried , “
128666	128667	128706	128706	you	4543	” “
128670	128691	128706	128706	you	4543	” cried the doctor , letting down the front glass in a great hurry , and shouting to the postillion ; “
128709	128846	128706	128706	you	4543	” Jingling and clattering , till distance rendered its noise inaudible , and its rapid progress only perceptible to the eye , the vehicle wound its way along the road , almost hidden in a cloud of dust : now wholly disappearing , and now becoming visible again , as intervening objects , or the intricacies of the way , permitted . It was not until even the dusty cloud was no longer to be seen , that the gazers dispersed . And there was one looker - on , who remained with eyes fixed upon the spot where the carriage had disappeared , long after it was many miles away ; for , behind the white curtain which had shrouded her from view when Harry raised his eyes towards the window , sat Rose herself . “
128855	128862	128847	128847	He	3237	” she said , at length . “
128884	129354	128877	128877	I	0	” Tears are signs of gladness as well as grief ; but those which coursed down Rose ’s face , as she sat pensively at the window , still gazing in the same direction , seemed to tell more of sorrow than of joy . CHAPTER XXXVII . IN WHICH THE READER MAY PERCEIVE A CONTRAST , NOT UNCOMMON IN MATRIMONIAL CASES Mr. Bumble sat in the workhouse parlour , with his eyes moodily fixed on the cheerless grate , whence , as it was summer time , no brighter gleam proceeded , than the reflection of certain sickly rays of the sun , which were sent back from its cold and shining surface . A paper fly - cage dangled from the ceiling , to which he occasionally raised his eyes in gloomy thought ; and , as the heedless insects hovered round the gaudy net - work , Mr. Bumble would heave a deep sigh , while a more gloomy shadow overspread his countenance . Mr. Bumble was meditating ; it might be that the insects brought to mind , some painful passage in his own past life . Nor was Mr. Bumble ’s gloom the only thing calculated to awaken a pleasing melancholy in the bosom of a spectator . There were not wanting other appearances , and those closely connected with his own person , which announced that a great change had taken place in the position of his affairs . The laced coat , and the cocked hat ; where were they ? He still wore knee - breeches , and dark cotton stockings on his nether limbs ; but they were not _ the _ breeches . The coat was wide - skirted ; and in that respect like _ the _ coat , but , oh how different ! The mighty cocked hat was replaced by a modest round one . Mr. Bumble was no longer a beadle . There are some promotions in life , which , independent of the more substantial rewards they offer , require peculiar value and dignity from the coats and waistcoats connected with them . A field - marshal has his uniform ; a bishop his silk apron ; a counsellor his silk gown ; a beadle his cocked hat . Strip the bishop of his apron , or the beadle of his hat and lace ; what are they ? Men . Mere men . Dignity , and even holiness too , sometimes , are more questions of coat and waistcoat than some people imagine . Mr. Bumble had married Mrs. Corney , and was master of the workhouse . Another beadle had come into power . On him the cocked hat , gold - laced coat , and staff , had all three descended . “
129363	129372	128877	128877	I	0	” said Mr. Bumble , with a sigh . “
129378	129416	128877	128877	I	0	” Mr. Bumble might have meant that he had concentrated a whole existence of happiness into the short space of eight weeks ; but the sigh — there was a vast deal of meaning in the sigh . “
129421	129433	129417	129417	I	0	” said Mr. Bumble , pursuing the same train of reflection , “
129477	129478	129467	129467	I	0	” “
129481	129492	129493	129493	you	0	” cried a shrill voice in Mr. Bumble ’s ear : “
129515	129552	129553	129554	Mrs. Bumble	258	” Mr. Bumble turned , and encountered the face of his interesting consort , who , imperfectly comprehending the few words she had overheard of his complaint , had hazarded the foregoing remark at a venture . “
129558	129568	129553	129554	Mrs. Bumble	258	” said Mr. Bumble , with a sentimental sternness . “
129571	129576	129553	129554	Mrs. Bumble	258	” cried the lady . “
129585	129596	129553	129554	Mrs. Bumble	258	” said Mr. Bumble , fixing his eyes upon her . “
129606	129613	129614	129614	she	258	” said Mr. Bumble to himself , “
129642	129779	129811	129811	ma’am	4840	” Whether an exceedingly small expansion of eye be sufficient to quell paupers , who , being lightly fed , are in no very high condition ; or whether the late Mrs. Corney was particularly proof against eagle glances ; are matters of opinion . The matter of fact , is , that the matron was in no way overpowered by Mr. Bumble ’s scowl , but , on the contrary , treated it with great disdain , and even raised a laugh thereat , which sounded as though it were genuine . On hearing this most unexpected sound , Mr. Bumble looked , first incredulous , and afterwards amazed . He then relapsed into his former state ; nor did he rouse himself until his attention was again awakened by the voice of his partner . “
129791	129796	129781	129781	you	0	” inquired Mrs. Bumble . “
129813	129818	129807	129807	I	0	” rejoined Mr. Bumble ; “
129852	129853	129855	129855	Your	0	” “
129859	129868	129869	129869	I	0	” sneered Mrs. Bumble , with ineffable contempt . “
129876	129881	129869	129869	I	0	” said Mr. Bumble . “
129891	129892	129885	129886	a man	476	” “
129908	129917	129885	129886	a man	476	” cried the relict of Mr. Corney deceased . “
129923	129928	129921	129921	ma’am	4840	” thundered Mr. Bumble . “
129959	130146	129951	129951	I	0	” Mrs. Bumble , seeing at a glance , that the decisive moment had now arrived , and that a blow struck for the mastership on one side or other , must necessarily be final and conclusive , no sooner heard this allusion to the dead and gone , than she dropped into a chair , and with a loud scream that Mr. Bumble was a hard - hearted brute , fell into a paroxysm of tears . But , tears were not the things to find their way to Mr. Bumble ’s soul ; his heart was waterproof . Like washable beaver hats that improve with rain , his nerves were rendered stouter and more vigorous , by showers of tears , which , being tokens of weakness , and so far tacit admissions of his own power , pleased and exalted him . He eyed his good lady with looks of great satisfaction , and begged , in an encouraging manner , that she should cry her hardest : the exercise being looked upon , by the faculty , as strongly conducive to health . “
130166	130171	129951	129951	I	0	” said Mr. Bumble . “
130176	130437	129951	129951	I	0	” As he discharged himself of this pleasantry , Mr. Bumble took his hat from a peg , and putting it on , rather rakishly , on one side , as a man might , who felt he had asserted his superiority in a becoming manner , thrust his hands into his pockets , and sauntered towards the door , with much ease and waggishness depicted in his whole appearance . Now , Mrs. Corney that was , had tried the tears , because they were less troublesome than a manual assault ; but , she was quite prepared to make trial of the latter mode of proceeding , as Mr. Bumble was not long in discovering . The first proof he experienced of the fact , was conveyed in a hollow sound , immediately succeeded by the sudden flying off of his hat to the opposite end of the room . This preliminary proceeding laying bare his head , the expert lady , clasping him tightly round the throat with one hand , inflicted a shower of blows ( dealt with singular vigour and dexterity ) upon it with the other . This done , she created a little variety by scratching his face , and tearing his hair ; and , having , by this time , inflicted as much punishment as she deemed necessary for the offence , she pushed him over a chair , which was luckily well situated for the purpose : and defied him to talk about his prerogative again , if he dared . “
130441	130452	129951	129951	I	0	” said Mrs. Bumble , in a voice of command . “
130469	130498	130461	130461	you	3248	” Mr. Bumble rose with a very rueful countenance : wondering much what something desperate might be . Picking up his hat , he looked towards the door . “
130503	130508	130500	130500	you	3248	” demanded Mrs. Bumble . “
130516	130529	130500	130500	you	3248	” rejoined Mr. Bumble , making a quicker motion towards the door . “
130552	130829	130830	130830	Hem	142	” At this instant , Mrs. Bumble stepped hastily forward to replace the carpet , which had been kicked up in the scuffle . Mr. Bumble immediately darted out of the room , without bestowing another thought on his unfinished sentence : leaving the late Mrs. Corney in full possession of the field . Mr. Bumble was fairly taken by surprise , and fairly beaten . He had a decided propensity for bullying : derived no inconsiderable pleasure from the exercise of petty cruelty ; and , consequently , was ( it is needless to say ) a coward . This is by no means a disparagement to his character ; for many official personages , who are held in high respect and admiration , are the victims of similar infirmities . The remark is made , indeed , rather in his favour than otherwise , and with a view of impressing the reader with a just sense of his qualifications for office . But , the measure of his degradation was not yet full . After making a tour of the house , and thinking , for the first time , that the poor - laws really were too hard on people ; and that men who ran away from their wives , leaving them chargeable to the parish , ought , in justice to be visited with no punishment at all , but rather rewarded as meritorious individuals who had suffered much ; Mr. Bumble came to a room where some of the female paupers were usually employed in washing the parish linen : when the sound of voices in conversation , now proceeded . “
130832	130844	130830	130830	Hem	142	” said Mr. Bumble , summoning up all his native dignity . “
130872	130920	130863	130863	you	142	” With these words , Mr. Bumble opened the door , and walked in with a very fierce and angry manner : which was at once exchanged for a most humiliated and cowering air , as his eyes unexpectedly rested on the form of his lady wife . “
130924	130929	130863	130863	you	142	” said Mr. Bumble , “
130938	130939	130930	130930	I	0	” “
130947	130952	130930	130930	I	0	” repeated Mrs. Bumble . “
130961	130962	130956	130956	you	4649	” “
130981	131014	130965	130965	they	3257	” replied Mr. Bumble : glancing distractedly at a couple of old women at the wash - tub , who were comparing notes of admiration at the workhouse - master ’s humility . “
131025	131030	131016	131016	You	0	” said Mrs. Bumble . “
131038	131039	131016	131016	You	0	” “
131045	131051	131016	131016	You	0	” urged Mr. Bumble submissively . “
131059	131066	131016	131016	You	0	” demanded Mrs. Bumble , again . “
131080	131085	131072	131072	you	4649	” submitted Mr. Bumble ; “
131099	131100	131087	131087	I	0	” “
131110	131115	131107	131108	Mr. Bumble	128	” returned his lady . “
131176	131331	131358	131358	I	0	” Mr. Bumble , seeing with excruciating feelings , the delight of the two old paupers , who were tittering together most rapturously , hesitated for an instant . Mrs. Bumble , whose patience brooked no delay , caught up a bowl of soap - suds , and motioning him towards the door , ordered him instantly to depart , on pain of receiving the contents upon his portly person . What could Mr. Bumble do ? He looked dejectedly round , and slunk away ; and , as he reached the door , the titterings of the paupers broke into a shrill chuckle of irrepressible delight . It wanted but this . He was degraded in their eyes ; he had lost caste and station before the very paupers ; he had fallen from all the height and pomp of beadleship , to the lowest depth of the most snubbed hen - peckery . “
131337	131347	131358	131358	I	0	” said Mr. Bumble , filled with dismal thoughts . “
131384	131818	131820	131820	you	3268	” It was too much . Mr. Bumble boxed the ears of the boy who opened the gate for him ( for he had reached the portal in his reverie ) ; and walked , distractedly , into the street . He walked up one street , and down another , until exercise had abated the first passion of his grief ; and then the revulsion of feeling made him thirsty . He passed a great many public - houses ; but , at length paused before one in a by - way , whose parlour , as he gathered from a hasty peep over the blinds , was deserted , save by one solitary customer . It began to rain , heavily , at the moment . This determined him . Mr. Bumble stepped in ; and ordering something to drink , as he passed the bar , entered the apartment into which he had looked from the street . The man who was seated there , was tall and dark , and wore a large cloak . He had the air of a stranger ; and seemed , by a certain haggardness in his look , as well as by the dusty soils on his dress , to have travelled some distance . He eyed Bumble askance , as he entered , but scarcely deigned to nod his head in acknowledgment of his salutation . Mr. Bumble had quite dignity enough for two ; supposing even that the stranger had been more familiar : so he drank his gin - and - water in silence , and read the paper with great show of pomp and circumstance . It so happened , however : as it will happen very often , when men fall into company under such circumstances : that Mr. Bumble felt , every now and then , a powerful inducement , which he could not resist , to steal a look at the stranger : and that whenever he did so , he withdrew his eyes , in some confusion , to find that the stranger was at that moment stealing a look at him . Mr. Bumble ’s awkwardness was enhanced by the very remarkable expression of the stranger ’s eye , which was keen and bright , but shadowed by a scowl of distrust and suspicion , unlike anything he had ever observed before , and repulsive to behold . When they had encountered each other ’s glance several times in this way , the stranger , in a harsh , deep voice , broke silence . “
131825	131829	131820	131820	you	3268	” he said , “
131838	131839	131820	131820	you	3268	” “
131852	131882	131850	131850	Mr.	3269	” Here Mr. Bumble stopped short ; for he was curious to know the stranger ’s name , and thought in his impatience , he might supply the blank . “
131889	131904	131885	131885	you	3268	” said the stranger ; an expression of quiet sarcasm playing about his mouth ; “
131928	131929	131918	131918	I	0	” “
131938	131945	131935	131936	young man	2851	” observed Mr. Bumble , majestically . “
131951	131971	131930	131930	I	0	” said the stranger . Another silence succeeded this short dialogue : which was again broken by the stranger . “
131981	131985	131978	131978	I	0	” said he . “
132021	132022	132023	132023	I	0	” “
132026	132035	132023	132023	I	0	” said Mr. Bumble , in some surprise ; “
132039	132040	132036	132037	porochial beadle	3272	” “
132044	132053	132036	132037	porochial beadle	3272	” rejoined the other , nodding his head . “
132068	132069	132065	132065	you	3268	” “
132075	132095	132065	132065	you	3268	” rejoined Mr. Bumble , slowly and impressively , to check any undue familiarity the stranger might otherwise assume . “
132104	132105	132106	132106	You	3268	” “
132125	132148	132121	132121	I	0	” resumed the stranger , looking keenly into Mr. Bumble ’s eyes , as he raised them in astonishment at the question . “
132167	132168	132158	132158	I	0	” “
132176	132202	132213	132213	he	3279	” replied Mr. Bumble , shading his eyes with his hand , and surveying the stranger , from head to foot , in evident perplexity , “
132251	132279	132338	132338	landlord	3281	” The stranger smiled , and nodded his head again : as much to say , he had not mistaken his man ; then rang the bell . “
132285	132299	132338	132338	landlord	3281	” he said , handing Mr. Bumble ’s empty tumbler to the landlord . “
132315	132316	132307	132307	You	3268	” “
132321	132331	132307	132307	You	3268	” replied Mr. Bumble , with a delicate cough . “
132340	132377	132338	132338	landlord	3281	” said the stranger , drily . The host smiled , disappeared , and shortly afterwards returned with a steaming jorum : of which , the first gulp brought the water into Mr. Bumble ’s eyes . “
132383	132395	132381	132381	me	0	” said the stranger , after closing the door and window . “
132479	132548	132555	132555	me	0	” As he spoke , he pushed a couple of sovereigns across the table to his companion , carefully , as though unwilling that the chinking of money should be heard without . When Mr. Bumble had scrupulously examined the coins , to see that they were genuine , and had put them up , with much satisfaction , in his waistcoat - pocket , he went on : “
132564	132565	132555	132555	me	0	” “
132572	132577	132555	132555	me	0	” said Mr. Bumble . “
132586	132587	132581	132581	I	0	” “
132594	132595	132581	132581	I	0	” “
132598	132599	132581	132581	I	0	” “
132606	132607	132581	132581	I	0	” “
132610	132611	132581	132581	I	0	” “
132662	132663	132670	132670	I	0	” “
132673	132687	132670	132670	I	0	” said Mr. Bumble , not quite following the stranger ’s excited description . “
132690	132695	132670	132670	I	0	” said the stranger . “
132702	132703	132704	132706	A many boys	3294	” “
132708	132719	132704	132706	A many boys	3294	” observed Mr. Bumble , shaking his head , despondingly . “
132727	132732	132733	132733	I	0	” cried the stranger ; “
132788	132789	132792	132792	you	0	” “
132799	132804	132807	132807	him	123	” said Mr. Bumble ; “
132820	132821	132815	132818	a obstinater young rascal	3299	” “
132839	132862	132832	132832	I	0	” said the stranger , stopping Mr. Bumble in the outset of a tirade on the subject of poor Oliver ’s vices . “
132880	132881	132878	132878	she	4784	” “
132886	132902	132884	132884	she	4784	” said Mr. Bumble , whom the gin - and - water had rendered facetious . “
132934	132935	132938	132938	you	0	” “
132941	132948	132938	132938	you	0	” demanded the stranger , sternly . “
132955	133229	132950	132950	she	4784	” rejoined Mr. Bumble . The man looked fixedly at him when he had given this information , and although he did not withdraw his eyes for some time afterwards , his gaze gradually became vacant and abstracted , and he seemed lost in thought . For some time , he appeared doubtful whether he ought to be relieved or disappointed by the intelligence ; but at length he breathed more freely ; and withdrawing his eyes , observed that it was no great matter . With that he rose , as if to depart . But Mr. Bumble was cunning enough ; and he at once saw that an opportunity was opened , for the lucrative disposal of some secret in the possession of his better half . He well remembered the night of old Sally ’s death , which the occurrences of that day had given him good reason to recollect , as the occasion on which he had proposed to Mrs. Corney ; and although that lady had never confided to him the disclosure of which she had been the solitary witness , he had heard enough to know that it related to something that had occurred in the old woman ’s attendance , as workhouse nurse , upon the young mother of Oliver Twist . Hastily calling this circumstance to mind , he informed the stranger , with an air of mystery , that one woman had been closeted with the old harridan shortly before she died ; and that she could , as he had reason to believe , throw some light on the subject of his inquiry . “
133236	133265	133232	133232	I	0	” said the stranger , thrown off his guard ; and plainly showing that all his fears ( whatever they were ) were aroused afresh by the intelligence . “
133270	133275	133232	133232	I	0	” rejoined Mr. Bumble . “
133278	133285	133232	133232	I	0	” cried the stranger , hastily . “
133288	133292	133232	133232	I	0	” rejoined Bumble . “
133299	133332	133232	133232	I	0	” said the stranger , producing a scrap of paper , and writing down upon it , an obscure address by the water - side , in characters that betrayed his agitation ; “
133359	133444	133356	133356	your	0	” With these words , he led the way to the door , after stopping to pay for the liquor that had been drunk . Shortly remarking that their roads were different , he departed , without more ceremony than an emphatic repetition of the hour of appointment for the following night . On glancing at the address , the parochial functionary observed that it contained no name . The stranger had not gone far , so he made after him to ask it . “
133450	133467	133447	133447	you	0	” cried the man , turning quickly round , as Bumble touched him on the arm . “
133471	133472	133447	133447	you	0	” “
133479	133491	133447	133447	you	0	” said the other , pointing to the scrap of paper . “
133500	133501	133502	133502	Monks	226	” “
133504	134161	133502	133502	Monks	226	” rejoined the man ; and strode hastily away . CHAPTER XXXVIII . CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF WHAT PASSED BETWEEN MR . AND MRS . BUMBLE , AND MR . MONKS , AT THEIR NOCTURNAL INTERVIEW It was a dull , close , overcast summer evening . The clouds , which had been threatening all day , spread out in a dense and sluggish mass of vapour , already yielded large drops of rain , and seemed to presage a violent thunder - storm , when Mr. and Mrs. Bumble , turning out of the main street of the town , directed their course towards a scattered little colony of ruinous houses , distant from it some mile and a - half , or thereabouts , and erected on a low unwholesome swamp , bordering upon the river . They were both wrapped in old and shabby outer garments , which might , perhaps , serve the double purpose of protecting their persons from the rain , and sheltering them from observation . The husband carried a lantern , from which , however , no light yet shone ; and trudged on , a few paces in front , as though — the way being dirty — to give his wife the benefit of treading in his heavy footprints . They went on , in profound silence ; every now and then , Mr. Bumble relaxed his pace , and turned his head as if to make sure that his helpmate was following ; then , discovering that she was close at his heels , he mended his rate of walking , and proceeded , at a considerable increase of speed , towards their place of destination . This was far from being a place of doubtful character ; for it had long been known as the residence of none but low ruffians , who , under various pretences of living by their labour , subsisted chiefly on plunder and crime . It was a collection of mere hovels : some , hastily built with loose bricks : others , of old worm - eaten ship - timber : jumbled together without any attempt at order or arrangement , and planted , for the most part , within a few feet of the river ’s bank . A few leaky boats drawn up on the mud , and made fast to the dwarf wall which skirted it : and here and there an oar or coil of rope : appeared , at first , to indicate that the inhabitants of these miserable cottages pursued some avocation on the river ; but a glance at the shattered and useless condition of the articles thus displayed , would have led a passer - by , without much difficulty , to the conjecture that they were disposed there , rather for the preservation of appearances , than with any view to their being actually employed . In the heart of this cluster of huts ; and skirting the river , which its upper stories overhung ; stood a large building , formerly used as a manufactory of some kind . It had , in its day , probably furnished employment to the inhabitants of the surrounding tenements . But it had long since gone to ruin . The rat , the worm , and the action of the damp , had weakened and rotted the piles on which it stood ; and a considerable portion of the building had already sunk down into the water ; while the remainder , tottering and bending over the dark stream , seemed to wait a favourable opportunity of following its old companion , and involving itself in the same fate . It was before this ruinous building that the worthy couple paused , as the first peal of distant thunder reverberated in the air , and the rain commenced pouring violently down . “
134169	134184	133502	133502	Monks	226	” said Bumble , consulting a scrap of paper he held in his hand . “
134188	134223	133502	133502	Monks	226	” cried a voice from above . Following the sound , Mr. Bumble raised his head and descried a man looking out of a door , breast - high , on the second story . “
134230	134235	133502	133502	Monks	226	” cried the voice ; “
134243	134255	134236	134236	I	0	” With which the head disappeared , and the door closed . “
134261	134276	134258	134259	the man	843	” asked Mr. Bumble ’s good lady . Mr. Bumble nodded in the affirmative . “
134285	134290	134281	134281	I	0	” said the matron : “
134310	134371	134258	134259	the man	843	” Mr. Bumble , who had eyed the building with very rueful looks , was apparently about to express some doubts relative to the advisability of proceeding any further with the enterprise just then , when he was prevented by the appearance of Monks : who opened a small door , near which they stood , and beckoned them inwards . “
134375	134387	134258	134259	the man	843	” he cried impatiently , stamping his foot upon the ground . “
134394	134447	134258	134259	the man	843	” The woman , who had hesitated at first , walked boldly in , without any other invitation . Mr. Bumble , who was ashamed or afraid to lag behind , followed : obviously very ill at ease and with scarcely any of that remarkable dignity which was usually his chief characteristic . “
134461	134481	134482	134482	We	3307	” said Monks , turning round , and addressing Bumble , after he had bolted the door behind them . “
134490	134499	134484	134484	we	3307	” stammered Bumble , looking apprehensively about him . “
134503	134507	134501	134501	yourselves	3305	” retorted Monks . “
134553	134597	134540	134540	You	3305	” With this agreeable speech , Monks turned short upon the matron , and bent his gaze upon her , till even she , who was not easily cowed , was fain to withdraw her eyes , and turn them towards the ground . “
134606	134610	134611	134611	Hem	142	” demanded Monks . “
134618	134630	134615	134616	the woman	6103	” replied Mr. Bumble , mindful of his wife ’s caution . “
134642	134662	134633	134633	women	1161	” said the matron , interposing , and returning , as she spoke , the searching look of Monks . “
134678	134682	134665	134665	they	1161	” said Monks . “
134689	134694	134698	134698	their	1161	” asked the matron . “
134703	134707	134698	134698	their	1161	” replied Monks . “
134751	134752	134749	134749	mistress	2437	” “
134755	134766	134749	134749	mistress	2437	” rejoined the matron , slightly colouring as she spoke . “
134773	134777	134780	134780	you	0	” said Monks . “
134782	134874	134780	134780	you	0	” Bestowing something half - way between a smile and a frown upon his two companions , and again beckoning them to follow him , the man hastened across the apartment , which was of considerable extent , but low in the roof . He was preparing to ascend a steep staircase , or rather ladder , leading to another floor of warehouses above : when a bright flash of lightning streamed down the aperture , and a peal of thunder followed , which shook the crazy building to its centre . “
134878	134885	134780	134780	you	0	” he cried , shrinking back . “
134914	134952	134909	134909	I	0	” He remained silent for a few moments ; and then , removing his hands suddenly from his face , showed , to the unspeakable discomposure of Mr. Bumble , that it was much distorted and discoloured . “
134963	134971	134976	134976	them	3316	” said Monks , observing his alarm ; “
134993	135063	135092	135093	The woman	6103	” Thus speaking , he led the way up the ladder ; and hastily closing the window - shutter of the room into which it led , lowered a lantern which hung at the end of a rope and pulley passed through one of the heavy beams in the ceiling : and which cast a dim light upon an old table and three chairs that were placed beneath it . “
135066	135078	135146	135146	she	6103	” said Monks , when they had all three seated themselves , “
135102	135127	135128	135128	He	3319	” The question was addressed to Bumble ; but his wife anticipated the reply , by intimating that she was perfectly acquainted with it . “
135151	135152	135146	135146	she	6103	” “
135162	135169	135146	135146	she	6103	” replied the matron interrupting him . “
135172	135173	135146	135146	she	6103	” “
135186	135190	135183	135183	her	6103	” said Monks . “
135196	135204	135183	135183	her	6103	” observed the woman with much deliberation . “
135216	135217	135183	135183	her	6103	” “
135233	135237	135238	135238	Nobody	316	” asked Monks . “
135247	135268	135243	135243	I	0	” answered Mrs. Bumble : who did not want for spirit , as her yoke - fellow could abundantly testify . “
135271	135284	135243	135243	I	0	” said Monks significantly , and with a look of eager inquiry ; “
135296	135297	135243	135243	I	0	” “
135302	135308	135243	135243	I	0	” was the composed reply . “
135316	135320	135243	135243	I	0	” said Monks . “
135329	135330	135331	135331	You	3319	” “
135336	135341	135331	135331	You	3319	” interrupted Mrs. Bumble . “
135363	135436	135355	135361	the man I ought to talk to	3325	” Mr. Bumble , who had not yet been admitted by his better half into any greater share of the secret than he had originally possessed , listened to this dialogue with outstretched neck and distended eyes : which he directed towards his wife and Monks , by turns , in undisguised astonishment ; increased , if possible , when the latter sternly demanded , what sum was required for the disclosure . “
135444	135454	135355	135361	the man I ought to talk to	3325	” asked the woman , as collectedly as before . “
135466	135470	135355	135361	the man I ought to talk to	3325	” replied Monks . “
135480	135481	135355	135361	the man I ought to talk to	3325	” “
135503	135508	135510	135510	I	0	” said the woman ; “
135521	135522	135510	135510	I	0	” “
135530	135537	135538	135538	I	0	” exclaimed Monks , drawing back . “
135546	135551	135538	135538	I	0	” replied Mrs. Bumble . “
135561	135562	135538	135538	I	0	” “
135581	135586	135538	135538	I	0	” cried Monks impatiently ; “
135600	135601	135538	135538	I	0	” “
135622	135636	135538	135538	I	0	” answered the matron , still preserving the resolute indifference she had assumed . “
135675	135676	135538	135538	I	0	” “
135685	135691	135679	135679	I	0	” asked Monks , hesitating . “
135700	135705	135692	135692	You	3319	” replied the matron . “
135718	135719	135709	135710	a woman	4784	” “
135731	135743	135745	135745	I	0	” submitted Mr. Bumble , in a voice tremulous with fear : “
135756	135768	135769	135770	Mr. Monks	226	” said Mr. Bumble , his teeth chattering as he spoke , “
135865	135937	135938	135938	You	4649	” As Mr. Bumble spoke , he made a melancholy feint of grasping his lantern with fierce determination ; and plainly showed , by the alarmed expression of every feature , that he _ did _ want a little rousing , and not a little , prior to making any very warlike demonstration : unless , indeed , against paupers , or other person or persons trained down for the purpose . “
135943	135951	135956	135956	your	4649	” said Mrs. Bumble , in reply ; “
135959	135960	135961	135961	He	226	” “
135983	135989	135974	135974	he	226	” said Monks , grimly . “
135999	136000	136001	136001	He	226	” “
136005	136014	136001	136001	He	226	” tittered the matron , parrying the question . “
136025	136044	136021	136021	you	4649	” rejoined Monks , marking the angry glance which the lady darted at her spouse as she spoke . “
136080	136115	136072	136072	I	0	” He thrust his hand into a side - pocket ; and producing a canvas bag , told out twenty - five sovereigns on the table , and pushed them over to the woman . “
136118	136122	136072	136072	I	0	” he said , “
136158	136274	136155	136155	your	4649	” The thunder , which seemed in fact much nearer , and to shiver and break almost over their heads , having subsided , Monks , raising his face from the table , bent forward to listen to what the woman should say . The faces of the three nearly touched , as the two men leant over the small table in their eagerness to hear , and the woman also leant forward to render her whisper audible . The sickly rays of the suspended lantern falling directly upon them , aggravated the paleness and anxiety of their countenances : which , encircled by the deepest gloom and darkness , looked ghastly in the extreme . “
136287	136292	136293	136293	she	3340	” the matron began , “
136299	136300	136293	136293	she	3340	” “
136307	136317	136303	136304	no one	1478	” asked Monks , in the same hollow whisper ; “
136342	136343	136345	136346	a soul	3345	” “
136348	136353	136345	136346	a soul	3345	” replied the woman ; “
136372	136373	136359	136359	I	0	” “
136376	136384	136359	136359	I	0	” said Monks , regarding her attentively . “
136388	136389	136390	136390	She	3340	” “
136397	136402	136393	136395	a young creature	3346	” resumed the matron , “
136435	136436	136430	136430	she	3340	” “
136439	136453	136430	136430	she	3340	” said Monks , with quivering lip , and glancing over his shoulder , “
136461	136462	136463	136464	The child	306	” “
136475	136486	136487	136488	the mother	2473	” said the matron , nodding carelessly towards her husband ; “
136494	136495	136487	136488	the mother	2473	” “
136499	136503	136487	136488	the mother	2473	” asked Monks . “
136507	136518	136519	136519	She	3340	” replied the woman , with something like a shudder . “
136555	136556	136557	136557	She	3340	” “
136561	136569	136571	136571	she	3340	” cried Monks , with desperate eagerness ; “
136586	136587	136589	136589	she	3340	” “
136603	136608	136589	136589	she	3340	” said the matron , “
136615	136616	136609	136609	she	3340	” “
136621	136641	136609	136609	she	3340	” cried Monks , in a voice which , from its very suppression , seemed only the more furious . “
136676	136677	136678	136678	She	3340	” “
136685	136711	136678	136678	She	3340	” said the woman , to all appearance unmoved ( as Mr. Bumble was very far from being ) by the strange man ’s violence ; “
136756	136757	136713	136713	she	3340	” “
136761	136768	136713	136713	she	3340	” interposed Monks , stretching forward . “
136771	136776	136713	136713	she	3340	” replied the woman ; “
136784	136785	136779	136780	a pawnbroker	3357	” “
136789	136793	136779	136780	a pawnbroker	3357	” demanded Monks . “
136802	136807	136797	136797	I	0	” said the woman . “
136929	136930	136883	136883	I	0	” “
136936	136941	136883	136883	I	0	” asked Monks quickly . “
136946	137014	136883	136883	I	0	” replied the woman . And , as if glad to be relieved of it , she hastily threw upon the table a small kid bag scarcely large enough for a French watch , which Monks pouncing upon , tore open with trembling hands . It contained a little gold locket : in which were two locks of hair , and a plain gold wedding - ring . “
137027	137032	136883	136883	I	0	” said the woman . “
137064	137065	137059	137059	I	0	” “
137071	137089	137059	137059	I	0	” said Monks , after a close and eager scrutiny of the contents of the little packet . “
137092	137160	137059	137059	I	0	” replied the woman . Mr. Bumble drew a long breath , as if he were glad to find that the story was over , and no mention made of taking the five - and - twenty pounds back again ; and now he took courage to wipe the perspiration which had been trickling over his nose , unchecked , during the whole of the previous dialogue . “
137175	137187	137189	137189	I	0	” said his wife addressing Monks , after a short silence ; “
137212	137213	137214	137214	You	0	” “
137218	137228	137214	137214	You	0	” said Monks , with some show of surprise ; “
137239	137240	137214	137214	You	0	” “
137246	137257	137214	137214	You	0	” observed Mr. Bumble , essaying a stroke of facetiousness . “
137268	137273	137261	137261	you	0	” demanded the matron . “
137277	137281	137261	137261	you	0	” replied Monks . “
137286	137287	137261	137261	you	0	” “
137304	137305	137214	137214	You	0	” “
137308	137312	137214	137214	You	0	” rejoined Monks ; “
137338	137389	137214	137214	You	0	” With these words , he suddenly wheeled the table aside , and pulling an iron ring in the boarding , threw back a large trap - door which opened close at Mr. Bumble ’s feet , and caused that gentleman to retire several paces backward , with great precipitation . “
137393	137404	137214	137214	You	0	” said Monks , lowering the lantern into the gulf . “
137434	137553	137410	137410	I	0	” Thus encouraged , the matron drew near to the brink ; and even Mr. Bumble himself , impelled by curiousity , ventured to do the same . The turbid water , swollen by the heavy rain , was rushing rapidly on below ; and all other sounds were lost in the noise of its plashing and eddying against the green and slimy piles . There had once been a water - mill beneath ; the tide foaming and chafing round the few rotten stakes , and fragments of machinery that yet remained , seemed to dart onward , with a new impulse , when freed from the obstacles which had unavailingly attempted to stem its headlong course . “
137571	137586	137555	137555	you	0	” said Monks , swinging the lantern to and fro in the dark well . “
137599	137692	137555	137555	you	0	” replied Bumble , recoiling at the thought . Monks drew the little packet from his breast , where he had hurriedly thrust it ; and tying it to a leaden weight , which had formed a part of some pulley , and was lying on the floor , dropped it into the stream . It fell straight , and true as a die ; clove the water with a scarcely audible splash ; and was gone . The three looking into each other ’s faces , seemed to breathe more freely . “
137695	137714	137555	137555	you	0	” said Monks , closing the trap - door , which fell heavily back into its former position . “
137761	137762	137746	137746	We	3364	” “
137767	137776	137746	137746	We	3364	” observed Mr. Bumble , with great alacrity . “
137790	137799	137788	137788	you	0	” said Monks , with a threatening look . “
137808	137809	137788	137788	you	0	” “
137819	137835	137816	137817	young man	2851	” answered Mr. Bumble , bowing himself gradually towards the ladder , with excessive politeness . “
137854	137855	137851	137852	Mr. Monks	226	” “
137868	137872	137856	137856	I	0	” remarked Monks . “
137888	138587	137885	137885	you	0	” It was fortunate that the conversation terminated at this point , or Mr. Bumble , who had bowed himself to within six inches of the ladder , would infallibly have pitched headlong into the room below . He lighted his lantern from that which Monks had detached from the rope , and now carried in his hand ; and making no effort to prolong the discourse , descended in silence , followed by his wife . Monks brought up the rear , after pausing on the steps to satisfy himself that there were no other sounds to be heard than the beating of the rain without , and the rushing of the water . They traversed the lower room , slowly , and with caution ; for Monks started at every shadow ; and Mr. Bumble , holding his lantern a foot above the ground , walked not only with remarkable care , but with a marvellously light step for a gentleman of his figure : looking nervously about him for hidden trap - doors . The gate at which they had entered , was softly unfastened and opened by Monks ; merely exchanging a nod with their mysterious acquaintance , the married couple emerged into the wet and darkness outside . They were no sooner gone , than Monks , who appeared to entertain an invincible repugnance to being left alone , called to a boy who had been hidden somewhere below . Bidding him go first , and bear the light , he returned to the chamber he had just quitted . CHAPTER XXXIX . INTRODUCES SOME RESPECTABLE CHARACTERS WITH WHOM THE READER IS ALREADY ACQUAINTED , AND SHOWS HOW MONKS AND THE JEW LAID THEIR WORTHY HEADS TOGETHER On the evening following that upon which the three worthies mentioned in the last chapter , disposed of their little matter of business as therein narrated , Mr. William Sikes , awakening from a nap , drowsily growled forth an inquiry what time of night it was . The room in which Mr. Sikes propounded this question , was not one of those he had tenanted , previous to the Chertsey expedition , although it was in the same quarter of the town , and was situated at no great distance from his former lodgings . It was not , in appearance , so desirable a habitation as his old quarters : being a mean and badly - furnished apartment , of very limited size ; lighted only by one small window in the shelving roof , and abutting on a close and dirty lane . Nor were there wanting other indications of the good gentleman ’s having gone down in the world of late : for a great scarcity of furniture , and total absence of comfort , together with the disappearance of all such small moveables as spare clothes and linen , bespoke a state of extreme poverty ; while the meagre and attenuated condition of Mr. Sikes himself would have fully confirmed these symptoms , if they had stood in any need of corroboration . The housebreaker was lying on the bed , wrapped in his white great - coat , by way of dressing - gown , and displaying a set of features in no degree improved by the cadaverous hue of illness , and the addition of a soiled nightcap , and a stiff , black beard of a week ’s growth . The dog sat at the bedside : now eyeing his master with a wistful look , and now pricking his ears , and uttering a low growl as some noise in the street , or in the lower part of the house , attracted his attention . Seated by the window , busily engaged in patching an old waistcoat which formed a portion of the robber ’s ordinary dress , was a female : so pale and reduced with watching and privation , that there would have been considerable difficulty in recognising her as the same Nancy who has already figured in this tale , but for the voice in which she replied to Mr. Sikes ’s question . “
138593	138598	137885	137885	you	0	” said the girl . “
138607	138608	138605	138605	Bill	149	” “
138614	138628	138605	138605	Bill	149	” replied Mr. Sikes , with an imprecation on his eyes and limbs . “
138646	138683	138686	138686	you	3370	” Illness had not improved Mr. Sikes ’s temper ; for , as the girl raised him up and led him to a chair , he muttered various curses on her awkwardness , and struck her . “
138688	138692	138686	138686	you	3370	” said Sikes . “
138719	138720	138717	138717	me	0	” “
138725	138740	138723	138723	you	3370	” replied the girl , turning her face aside , and forcing a laugh . “
138751	138752	138744	138744	you	3370	” “
138765	138778	138763	138763	you	3370	” growled Sikes , marking the tear which trembled in her eye . “
138788	138789	138785	138785	you	3370	” “
138809	138821	138807	138807	Bill	149	” said the girl , laying her hand upon his shoulder . “
138824	138829	138807	138807	Bill	149	” cried Mr. Sikes . “
138833	138834	138799	138799	you	3370	” “
138841	138867	138807	138807	Bill	149	” said the girl , with a touch of woman ’s tenderness , which communicated something like sweetness of tone , even to her voice : “
138938	138939	138934	138934	you	3370	” “
138944	138949	138934	138934	you	3370	” rejoined Mr. Sikes , “
138966	138967	138960	138961	the girls	3373	” “
138972	138983	138960	138961	the girls	3373	” said the girl , throwing herself into a chair . “
138998	138999	138986	138986	you	3370	” “
139005	139014	138986	138986	you	3370	” demanded Mr. Sikes in a savage voice . “
139044	139177	139039	139040	your woman	3374	” At any other time , this remonstrance , and the tone in which it was delivered , would have had the desired effect ; but the girl being really weak and exhausted , dropped her head over the back of the chair , and fainted , before Mr. Sikes could get out a few of the appropriate oaths with which , on similar occasions , he was accustomed to garnish his threats . Not knowing , very well , what to do , in this uncommon emergency ; for Miss Nancy ’s hysterics were usually of that violent kind which the patient fights and struggles out of , without much assistance ; Mr. Sikes tried a little blasphemy : and finding that mode of treatment wholly ineffectual , called for assistance . “
139187	139194	139204	139204	you	3370	” said Fagin , looking in . “
139206	139211	139204	139204	you	3370	” replied Sikes impatiently . “
139221	139321	139204	139204	you	3370	” With an exclamation of surprise , Fagin hastened to the girl ’s assistance , while Mr. John Dawkins ( otherwise the Artful Dodger ) , who had followed his venerable friend into the room , hastily deposited on the floor a bundle with which he was laden ; and snatching a bottle from the grasp of Master Charles Bates who came close at his heels , uncorked it in a twinkling with his teeth , and poured a portion of its contents down the patient ’s throat : previously taking a taste , himself , to prevent mistakes . “
139335	139340	139333	139333	Charley	164	” said Mr. Dawkins ; “
139355	139441	139350	139350	Bill	149	” These united restoratives , administered with great energy : especially that department consigned to Master Bates , who appeared to consider his share in the proceedings , a piece of unexampled pleasantry : were not long in producing the desired effect . The girl gradually recovered her senses ; and , staggering to a chair by the bedside , hid her face upon the pillow : leaving Mr. Sikes to confront the new comers , in some astonishment at their unlooked - for appearance . “
139452	139457	139350	139350	Bill	149	” he asked Fagin . “
139518	139579	139610	139610	Bill	149	” In compliance with Mr. Fagin ’s request , the Artful untied this bundle , which was of large size , and formed of an old table - cloth ; and handed the articles it contained , one by one , to Charley Bates : who placed them on the table , with various encomiums on their rarity and excellence . “
139587	139600	139585	139585	Bill	149	” exclaimed that young gentleman , disclosing to view a huge pasty ; “
139731	139796	139855	139855	you	149	” Uttering this last panegyric , Master Bates produced , from one of his extensive pockets , a full - sized wine - bottle , carefully corked ; while Mr. Dawkins , at the same instant , poured out a wine - glassful of raw spirits from the bottle he carried : which the invalid tossed down his throat without a moment ’s hesitation . “
139799	139810	139855	139855	you	149	” said Fagin , rubbing his hands with great satisfaction . “
139822	139823	139817	139817	you	149	” “
139826	139831	139832	139832	I	0	” exclaimed Mr. Sikes ; “
139876	139877	139880	139880	him	476	” “
139884	139892	139880	139880	him	476	” said Fagin , shrugging his shoulders . “
139908	139909	139916	139916	their	3386	” “
139919	139934	139916	139916	their	3386	” observed Mr. Sikes : a little soothed as he glanced over the table ; “
139991	139992	139989	139989	Charley	164	” “
140003	140014	139993	139993	I	0	” cried Master Bates , doing as he was desired . “
140046	140047	140027	140027	He	476	” “
140052	140068	140027	140027	He	476	” cried Sikes , as the dog retreated under the bed : still growling angrily . “
140085	140086	140071	140071	you	149	” “
140105	140110	140087	140087	I	0	” replied the Jew . “
140118	140122	140129	140129	you	149	” demanded Sikes . “
140144	140145	140146	140146	I	0	” “
140176	140177	140166	140166	I	0	” “
140182	140190	140166	140166	I	0	” growled Sikes , with excessive disgust . “
140225	140226	140204	140205	you boys	3393	” “
140237	140243	140244	140244	I	0	” urged Fagin , submissively . “
140255	140256	140244	140244	I	0	” “
140267	140276	140277	140277	You	149	” replied Sikes , with a bitter grin . “
140351	140352	140356	140356	Bill	149	” “
140358	140368	140356	140356	Bill	149	” remonstrated Fagin , eagerly catching at the word . “
140396	140397	140398	140398	He	161	” “
140404	140412	140398	140398	He	161	” said Nancy , coming hastily forward . “
140421	140526	140398	140398	He	161	” Nancy ’s appearance gave a new turn to the conversation ; for the boys , receiving a sly wink from the wary old Jew , began to ply her with liquor : of which , however , she took very sparingly ; while Fagin , assuming an unusual flow of spirits , gradually brought Mr. Sikes into a better temper , by affecting to regard his threats as a little pleasant banter ; and , moreover , by laughing very heartily at one or two rough jokes , which , after repeated applications to the spirit - bottle , he condescended to make . “
140533	140538	140398	140398	He	161	” said Mr. Sikes ; “
140549	140550	140540	140540	I	0	” “
140561	140566	140551	140551	I	0	” replied the Jew . “
140575	140579	140568	140568	you	149	” retorted Sikes ; “
140588	140589	140581	140581	I	0	” “
140592	140601	140581	140581	I	0	” cried Fagin , holding up his hands . “
140610	140611	140602	140602	I	0	” “
140643	140647	140623	140623	I	0	” said Sikes ; “
140660	140661	140649	140649	I	0	” “
140666	140674	140649	140649	I	0	” said Fagin , with a sigh , “
140683	140684	140678	140679	the Artful	5375	” “
140694	140699	140685	140685	You	149	” rejoined Mr. Sikes . “
140772	140994	140759	140759	I	0	” After a great deal of haggling and squabbling , Fagin beat down the amount of the required advance from five pounds to three pounds four and sixpence : protesting with many solemn asseverations that that would only leave him eighteen - pence to keep house with ; Mr. Sikes sullenly remarking that if he could n’t get any more he must accompany him home ; with the Dodger and Master Bates put the eatables in the cupboard . The Jew then , taking leave of his affectionate friend , returned homeward , attended by Nancy and the boys : Mr. Sikes , meanwhile , flinging himself on the bed , and composing himself to sleep away the time until the young lady ’s return . In due course , they arrived at Fagin ’s abode , where they found Toby Crackit and Mr. Chitling intent upon their fifteenth game at cribbage , which it is scarcely necessary to say the latter gentleman lost , and with it , his fifteenth and last sixpence : much to the amusement of his young friends . Mr. Crackit , apparently somewhat ashamed at being found relaxing himself with a gentleman so much his inferior in station and mental endowments , yawned , and inquiring after Sikes , took up his hat to go . “
141001	141005	140996	140996	nobody	316	” asked Fagin . “
141011	141021	140996	140996	nobody	316	” answered Mr. Crackit , pulling up his collar ; “
141094	141211	141091	141091	I	0	” With these and other ejaculations of the same kind , Mr. Toby Crackit swept up his winnings , and crammed them into his waistcoat pocket with a haughty air , as though such small pieces of silver were wholly beneath the consideration of a man of his figure ; this done , he swaggered out of the room , with so much elegance and gentility , that Mr. Chitling , bestowing numerous admiring glances on his legs and boots till they were out of sight , assured the company that he considered his acquaintance cheap at fifteen sixpences an interview , and that he did n’t value his losses the snap of his little finger . “
141221	141232	141091	141091	I	0	” said Master Bates , highly amused by this declaration . “
141239	141244	141091	141091	I	0	” replied Mr. Chitling . “
141250	141251	141246	141246	I	0	” “
141260	141277	141252	141255	A very clever fellow	3408	” said Fagin , patting him on the shoulder , and winking to his other pupils . “
141291	141295	141287	141287	he	201	” asked Tom . “
141306	141307	141287	141287	he	201	” “
141324	141328	141322	141322	Fagin	161	” pursued Tom . “
141354	141355	141371	141371	He	201	” “
141358	141364	141371	141371	He	201	” cried Tom , triumphantly , “
141396	141397	141394	141394	Fagin	161	” “
141455	141579	141445	141445	It	3414	” In obedience to this hint , the boys , nodding to Nancy , took up their hats , and left the room ; the Dodger and his vivacious friend indulging , as they went , in many witticisms at the expense of Mr. Chitling ; in whose conduct , it is but justice to say , there was nothing very conspicuous or peculiar : inasmuch as there are a great number of spirited young bloods upon town , who pay a much higher price than Mr. Chitling for being seen in good society : and a great number of fine gentlemen ( composing the good society aforesaid ) who established their reputation upon very much the same footing as flash Toby Crackit . “
141582	141593	141445	141445	It	3414	” said Fagin , when they had left the room , “
141693	141705	141686	141686	I	0	” he said , hastily concealing the key in his breast ; “
141712	141848	141686	141686	I	0	” The girl , who was sitting at the table with her arms folded , appeared in no way interested in the arrival : or to care whether the person , whoever he was , came or went : until the murmur of a man ’s voice reached her ears . The instant she caught the sound , she tore off her bonnet and shawl , with the rapidity of lightning , and thrust them under the table . The Jew , turning round immediately afterwards , she muttered a complaint of the heat : in a tone of languor that contrasted , very remarkably , with the extreme haste and violence of this action : which , however , had been unobserved by Fagin , who had his back towards her at the time . “
141851	141862	141865	141869	the man I expected before	3420	” he whispered , as though nettled by the interruption ; “
141902	141966	141967	141972	Only one of my young people	3424	” Laying his skinny forefinger upon his lip , the Jew carried a candle to the door , as a man ’s step was heard upon the stairs without . He reached it , at the same moment as the visitor , who , coming hastily into the room , was close upon the girl before he observed her . It was Monks . “
141974	141989	141967	141972	Only one of my young people	3424	” said Fagin , observing that Monks drew back , on beholding a stranger . “
141996	142070	141994	141994	Nancy	167	” The girl drew closer to the table , and glancing at Monks with an air of careless levity , withdrew her eyes ; but as he turned towards Fagin , she stole another look ; so keen and searching , and full of purpose , that if there had been any bystander to observe the change , he could hardly have believed the two looks to have proceeded from the same person . “
142074	142078	141967	141972	Only one of my young people	3424	” inquired Fagin . “
142081	142082	141967	141972	Only one of my young people	3424	” “
142089	142108	141967	141972	Only one of my young people	3424	” asked Fagin , hesitating as though he feared to vex the other man by being too sanguine . “
142115	142122	142123	142123	I	0	” replied Monks with a smile . “
142139	142202	142132	142132	me	0	” The girl drew closer to the table , and made no offer to leave the room , although she could see that Monks was pointing to her . The Jew : perhaps fearing she might say something aloud about the money , if he endeavoured to get rid of her : pointed upward , and took Monks out of the room . “
142212	142405	142132	142132	me	0	” she could hear the man say as they went upstairs . Fagin laughed ; and making some reply which did not reach her , seemed , by the creaking of the boards , to lead his companion to the second story . Before the sound of their footsteps had ceased to echo through the house , the girl had slipped off her shoes ; and drawing her gown loosely over her head , and muffling her arms in it , stood at the door , listening with breathless interest . The moment the noise ceased , she glided from the room ; ascended the stairs with incredible softness and silence ; and was lost in the gloom above . The room remained deserted for a quarter of an hour or more ; the girl glided back with the same unearthly tread ; and , immediately afterwards , the two men were heard descending . Monks went at once into the street ; and the Jew crawled upstairs again for the money . When he returned , the girl was adjusting her shawl and bonnet , as if preparing to be gone . “
142410	142424	142408	142408	Nance	167	” exclaimed the Jew , starting back as he put down the candle , “
142430	142431	142427	142427	you	167	” “
142434	142454	142427	142427	you	167	” echoed the girl , shading her eyes with her hands , as if to look steadily at him . “
142466	142467	142460	142460	you	167	” “
142490	142496	142408	142408	Nance	167	” replied the girl carelessly . “
142509	142536	142500	142500	me	0	” With a sigh for every piece of money , Fagin told the amount into her hand . They parted without more conversation , merely interchanging a “
142541	143090	142500	142500	me	0	” When the girl got into the open street , she sat down upon a doorstep ; and seemed , for a few moments , wholly bewildered and unable to pursue her way . Suddenly she arose ; and hurrying on , in a direction quite opposite to that in which Sikes was awaiting her return , quickened her pace , until it gradually resolved into a violent run . After completely exhausting herself , she stopped to take breath : and , as if suddenly recollecting herself , and deploring her inability to do something she was bent upon , wrung her hands , and burst into tears . It might be that her tears relieved her , or that she felt the full hopelessness of her condition ; but she turned back ; and hurrying with nearly as great rapidity in the contrary direction ; partly to recover lost time , and partly to keep pace with the violent current of her own thoughts : soon reached the dwelling where she had left the housebreaker . If she betrayed any agitation , when she presented herself to Mr. Sikes , he did not observe it ; for merely inquiring if she had brought the money , and receiving a reply in the affirmative , he uttered a growl of satisfaction , and replacing his head upon the pillow , resumed the slumbers which her arrival had interrupted . It was fortunate for her that the possession of money occasioned him so much employment next day in the way of eating and drinking ; and withal had so beneficial an effect in smoothing down the asperities of his temper ; that he had neither time nor inclination to be very critical upon her behaviour and deportment . That she had all the abstracted and nervous manner of one who is on the eve of some bold and hazardous step , which it has required no common struggle to resolve upon , would have been obvious to the lynx - eyed Fagin , who would most probably have taken the alarm at once ; but Mr. Sikes lacking the niceties of discrimination , and being troubled with no more subtle misgivings than those which resolve themselves into a dogged roughness of behaviour towards everybody ; and being , furthermore , in an unusually amiable condition , as has been already observed ; saw nothing unusual in her demeanor , and indeed , troubled himself so little about her , that , had her agitation been far more perceptible than it was , it would have been very unlikely to have awakened his suspicions . As that day closed in , the girl ’s excitement increased ; and , when night came on , and she sat by , watching until the housebreaker should drink himself asleep , there was an unusual paleness in her cheek , and a fire in her eye , that even Sikes observed with astonishment . Mr. Sikes being weak from the fever , was lying in bed , taking hot water with his gin to render it less inflammatory ; and had pushed his glass towards Nancy to be replenished for the third or fourth time , when these symptoms first struck him . “
143097	143116	143117	143117	You	3427	” said the man , raising himself on his hands as he stared the girl in the face . “
143132	143133	143117	143117	You	3427	” “
143136	143141	143183	143183	you	0	” replied the girl . “
143154	143155	143146	143146	you	0	” “
143161	143176	143146	143146	you	0	” demanded Sikes , grasping her by the arm , and shaking her roughly . “
143192	143193	143188	143188	you	0	” “
143200	143220	143198	143198	Bill	149	” replied the girl , shivering , and as she did so , pressing her hands upon her eyes . “
143230	143263	143264	143264	I	0	” The tone of forced gaiety in which the last words were spoken , seemed to produce a deeper impression on Sikes than the wild and rigid look which had preceded them . “
143271	143275	143264	143264	I	0	” said Sikes ; “
143325	143326	143319	143319	you	3427	” “
143330	143335	143319	143319	you	3427	” asked the girl . “
143340	143357	143319	143319	you	3427	” said Sikes , fixing his eyes upon her , and muttering the words to himself ; “
143391	143455	143379	143379	She	3430	” Fortifying himself with this assurance , Sikes drained the glass to the bottom , and then , with many grumbling oaths , called for his physic . The girl jumped up , with great alacrity ; poured it quickly out , but with her back towards him ; and held the vessel to his lips , while he drank off the contents . “
143458	143463	143379	143379	She	3430	” said the robber , “
143498	143624	143479	143479	I	0	” The girl obeyed . Sikes , locking her hand in his , fell back upon the pillow : turning his eyes upon her face . They closed ; opened again ; closed once more ; again opened . He shifted his position restlessly ; and , after dozing again , and again , for two or three minutes , and as often springing up with a look of terror , and gazing vacantly about him , was suddenly stricken , as it were , while in the very attitude of rising , into a deep and heavy sleep . The grasp of his hand relaxed ; the upraised arm fell languidly by his side ; and he lay like one in a profound trance . “
143633	143645	143479	143479	I	0	” murmured the girl , as she rose from the bedside . “
143655	143759	143646	143646	I	0	” She hastily dressed herself in her bonnet and shawl : looking fearfully round , from time to time , as if , despite the sleeping draught , she expected every moment to feel the pressure of Sikes ’s heavy hand upon her shoulder ; then , stooping softly over the bed , she kissed the robber ’s lips ; and then opening and closing the room - door with noiseless touch , hurried from the house . A watchman was crying half - past nine , down a dark passage through which she had to pass , in gaining the main thoroughfare . “
143769	143774	143646	143646	I	0	” asked the girl . “
143784	143796	143646	143646	I	0	” said the man : raising his lantern to her face . “
143811	143910	143798	143798	I	0	” muttered Nancy : brushing swiftly past him , and gliding rapidly down the street . Many of the shops were already closing in the back lanes and avenues through which she tracked her way , in making from Spitalfields towards the West - End of London . The clock struck ten , increasing her impatience . She tore along the narrow pavement : elbowing the passengers from side to side ; and darting almost under the horses ’ heads , crossed crowded streets , where clusters of persons were eagerly watching their opportunity to do the like . “
143916	144118	143911	143912	The woman	6103	” said the people , turning to look after her as she rushed away . When she reached the more wealthy quarter of the town , the streets were comparatively deserted ; and here her headlong progress excited a still greater curiosity in the stragglers whom she hurried past . Some quickened their pace behind , as though to see whither she was hastening at such an unusual rate ; and a few made head upon her , and looked back , surprised at her undiminished speed ; but they fell off one by one ; and when she neared her place of destination , she was alone . It was a family hotel in a quiet but handsome street near Hyde Park . As the brilliant light of the lamp which burnt before its door , guided her to the spot , the clock struck eleven . She had loitered for a few paces as though irresolute , and making up her mind to advance ; but the sound determined her , and she stepped into the hall . The porter ’s seat was vacant . She looked round with an air of incertitude , and advanced towards the stairs . “
144124	144140	144121	144122	young woman	3433	” said a smartly - dressed female , looking out from a door behind her , “
144147	144148	144143	144143	you	3433	” “
144158	144163	144164	144165	A lady	5993	” answered the girl . “
144167	144178	144179	144180	What lady	3437	” was the reply , accompanied with a scornful look . “
144182	144183	144179	144180	What lady	3437	” “
144187	144230	144179	144180	What lady	3437	” said Nancy . The young woman , who had by this time , noted her appearance , replied only by a look of virtuous disdain ; and summoned a man to answer her . To him , Nancy repeated her request . “
144238	144243	144234	144234	I	0	” asked the waiter . “
144252	144256	144234	144234	I	0	” replied Nancy . “
144260	144265	144234	144234	I	0	” said the man . “
144272	144277	144234	144234	I	0	” rejoined the girl . “
144284	144285	144281	144282	the lady	711	” “
144288	144299	144281	144282	the lady	711	” said the man , pushing her towards the door . “
144308	144309	144305	144305	yourself	0	” “
144319	144325	144327	144327	I	0	” said the girl violently ; “
144349	144356	144346	144347	anybody here	2506	” she said , looking round , “
144371	144406	144346	144347	anybody here	2506	” This appeal produced an effect on a good - tempered - faced man - cook , who with some of the other servants was looking on , and who stepped forward to interfere . “
144419	144424	144417	144417	you	263	” said this person . “
144430	144435	144417	144417	you	263	” replied the man . “
144452	144505	144440	144442	the young lady	1668	” This allusion to Nancy ’s doubtful character , raised a vast quantity of chaste wrath in the bosoms of four housemaids , who remarked , with great fervour , that the creature was a disgrace to her sex ; and strongly advocated her being thrown , ruthlessly , into the kennel . “
144513	144524	144508	144508	you	3443	” said the girl , turning to the men again ; “
144547	144572	144542	144543	God Almighty	171	” The soft - hearted cook added his intercession , and the result was that the man who had first appeared undertook its delivery . “
144579	144591	144542	144543	God Almighty	171	” said the man , with one foot on the stairs . “
144605	144609	144593	144595	a young woman	324	” said Nancy ; “
144647	144648	144649	144649	I	0	” “
144652	144657	144649	144649	I	0	” said the man , “
144664	144665	144666	144666	You	0	” “
144671	144677	144666	144666	You	0	” said the girl firmly ; “
144685	144744	144666	144666	You	0	” The man ran upstairs . Nancy remained , pale and almost breathless , listening with quivering lip to the very audible expressions of scorn , of which the chaste housemaids were very prolific ; and of which they became still more so , when the man returned , and said the young woman was to walk upstairs . “
144755	144761	144762	144762	Brass	264	” said the first housemaid . “
144775	144786	144762	144762	Brass	264	” said the second . The third contented herself with wondering “
144792	144804	144788	144788	ladies	928	” ; and the fourth took the first in a quartette of “
144807	145129	144788	144788	ladies	928	” with which the Dianas concluded . Regardless of all this : for she had weightier matters at heart : Nancy followed the man , with trembling limbs , to a small ante - chamber , lighted by a lamp from the ceiling . Here he left her , and retired . CHAPTER XL . A STRANGE INTERVIEW , WHICH IS A SEQUEL TO THE LAST CHAMBER The girl ’s life had been squandered in the streets , and among the most noisome of the stews and dens of London , but there was something of the woman ’s original nature left in her still ; and when she heard a light step approaching the door opposite to that by which she had entered , and thought of the wide contrast which the small room would in another moment contain , she felt burdened with the sense of her own deep shame , and shrunk as though she could scarcely bear the presence of her with whom she had sought this interview . But struggling with these better feelings was pride,—the vice of the lowest and most debased creatures no less than of the high and self - assured . The miserable companion of thieves and ruffians , the fallen outcast of low haunts , the associate of the scourings of the jails and hulks , living within the shadow of the gallows itself,—even this degraded being felt too proud to betray a feeble gleam of the womanly feeling which she thought a weakness , but which alone connected her with that humanity , of which her wasting life had obliterated so many , many traces when a very child . She raised her eyes sufficiently to observe that the figure which presented itself was that of a slight and beautiful girl ; then , bending them on the ground , she tossed her head with affected carelessness as she said : “
145175	145176	145177	145177	I	0	” “
145190	145194	145177	145177	I	0	” replied Rose . “
145218	145257	145212	145216	the person you inquired for	3453	” The kind tone of this answer , the sweet voice , the gentle manner , the absence of any accent of haughtiness or displeasure , took the girl completely by surprise , and she burst into tears . “
145264	145276	145212	145216	the person you inquired for	3453	” she said , clasping her hands passionately before her face , “
145295	145296	145289	145289	me,—there	3456	” “
145300	145306	145289	145289	me,—there	3456	” said Rose , earnestly . “
145331	145332	145337	145337	lady	3450	” “
145339	145347	145334	145334	me	0	” said the girl , still weeping , “
145375	145376	145337	145337	lady	3450	” “
145379	145401	145337	145337	lady	3450	” said Rose , recoiling a few steps , as if to be nearer assistance in case she should require it . “
145404	145405	145337	145337	lady	3450	” “
145408	145413	145414	145414	I	0	” said the girl , “
145455	145456	145457	145457	You	3450	” “
145459	145464	145465	145465	I	0	” said Rose Maylie . “
145469	145474	145465	145465	I	0	” replied the girl . “
145576	145577	145567	145567	I	0	” “
145584	145595	145567	145567	I	0	” said Rose , involuntarily falling from her strange companion . “
145605	145610	145597	145597	Heaven	218	” cried the girl , “
145682	145683	145684	145684	I	0	” “
145688	145697	145684	145684	I	0	” said Rose , in a broken voice . “
145706	145707	145684	145684	I	0	” “
145715	145720	145684	145684	I	0	” rejoined the girl . “

145777	145781	145771	145771	Monks	226	” said Rose . “
145786	145791	145782	145782	He	3476	” replied the girl ; “
145813	145814	145815	145815	I	0	” “
145821	145825	145815	145815	I	0	” said Rose . “
145835	145840	145827	145827	he	3476	” rejoined the girl , “
145909	145910	145897	145897	Monks	226	” “
145913	145917	145897	145897	Monks	226	” said Rose , “
145921	145922	145924	145925	That Monks	3482	” “
145927	145932	145924	145925	That Monks	3482	” pursued the girl , “
146017	146018	146014	146014	his	161	” “
146023	146027	146028	146028	He	161	” asked Rose . “
146048	146053	146028	146028	He	161	” said the girl ; “
146090	146091	146083	146083	him	161	” “
146097	146098	146083	146083	him	161	” “

146437	146441	146434	146435	His brother	3507	” exclaimed Rose . “
146447	146478	146444	146444	his	161	” said Nancy , glancing uneasily round , as she had scarcely ceased to do , since she began to speak , for a vision of Sikes haunted her perpetually . “
146558	146559	146560	146560	You	3509	” “
146565	146573	146560	146560	You	3509	” said Rose , turning very pale , “
146584	146585	146586	146586	He	161	” “
146600	146609	146586	146586	He	161	” replied the girl , shaking her head . “

146684	146688	146681	146681	I	0	” said Rose . “

146900	146917	146877	146877	your	3509	” said the earnest girl , folding her hands as the tears coursed down her face , “

146977	146987	146990	146993	sweet , angel lady	3521	” cried the girl , sinking on her knees , “

147067	147079	147020	147020	they	3522	” cried the girl , writhing in agony of her mind ; “

147152	147153	147141	147141	He	3523	” “
147158	147162	147141	147141	He	3523	” cried Rose , “

147199	147204	147191	147191	I	0	” answered the girl ; “
147290	147291	147273	147273	I	0	” “
147298	147302	147303	147303	I	0	” said Rose . “

147326	147333	147323	147323	you	0	” rejoined the girl , rising . “
147361	147362	147323	147323	you	0	” “
147376	147380	147372	147372	you	0	” said Rose . “

147430	147435	147407	147407	You	0	” rejoined the girl . “
147448	147452	147453	147453	I	0	” asked Rose . “
147481	147482	147484	147484	you	0	” “
147520	147525	147526	147526	I	0	” asked the girl . “
147531	147535	147526	147526	I	0	” answered Rose . “
147548	147555	147556	147556	I	0	” said the girl without hesitation , “
147567	147568	147556	147556	I	0	” “
147573	147586	147556	147556	I	0	” interposed Rose , as the girl moved hurriedly towards the door . “
147700	147701	147692	147692	I	0	” “
147716	147722	147703	147703	ladies	928	” replied the girl steadily , “
147857	147858	147859	147859	You	3450	” “
147862	147870	147859	147859	You	3450	” said Rose , after a pause , “
147894	147895	147859	147859	You	3450	” “
147900	147909	147859	147859	You	3450	” replied the girl , waving her hand . “
147923	147931	147917	147917	my	0	” said Rose , stepping gently forward . “
147939	147940	147932	147932	I	0	” “
147949	147958	147941	147941	You	3450	” replied the girl , wringing her hands , “
148029	148544	148572	148572	he	3547	” Thus speaking , and sobbing aloud , the unhappy creature turned away ; while Rose Maylie , overpowered by this extraordinary interview , which had more the semblance of a rapid dream than an actual occurrence , sank into a chair , and endeavoured to collect her wandering thoughts . CHAPTER XLI . CONTAINING FRESH DISCOVERIES , AND SHOWING THAT SUPRISES , LIKE MISFORTUNES , SELDOM COME ALONE Her situation was , indeed , one of no common trial and difficulty . While she felt the most eager and burning desire to penetrate the mystery in which Oliver ’s history was enveloped , she could not but hold sacred the confidence which the miserable woman with whom she had just conversed , had reposed in her , as a young and guileless girl . Her words and manner had touched Rose Maylie ’s heart ; and , mingled with her love for her young charge , and scarcely less intense in its truth and fervour , was her fond wish to win the outcast back to repentance and hope . They purposed remaining in London only three days , prior to departing for some weeks to a distant part of the coast . It was now midnight of the first day . What course of action could she determine upon , which could be adopted in eight - and - forty hours ? Or how could she postpone the journey without exciting suspicion ? Mr. Losberne was with them , and would be for the next two days ; but Rose was too well acquainted with the excellent gentleman ’s impetuosity , and foresaw too clearly the wrath with which , in the first explosion of his indignation , he would regard the instrument of Oliver ’s recapture , to trust him with the secret , when her representations in the girl ’s behalf could be seconded by no experienced person . These were all reasons for the greatest caution and most circumspect behaviour in communicating it to Mrs. Maylie , whose first impulse would infallibly be to hold a conference with the worthy doctor on the subject . As to resorting to any legal adviser , even if she had known how to do so , it was scarcely to be thought of , for the same reason . Once the thought occurred to her of seeking assistance from Harry ; but this awakened the recollection of their last parting , and it seemed unworthy of her to call him back , when — the tears rose to her eyes as she pursued this train of reflection — he might have by this time learnt to forget her , and to be happier away . Disturbed by these different reflections ; inclining now to one course and then to another , and again recoiling from all , as each successive consideration presented itself to her mind ; Rose passed a sleepless and anxious night . After more communing with herself next day , she arrived at the desperate conclusion of consulting Harry . “
148552	148556	148572	148572	he	3547	” she thought , “
148615	148718	148604	148604	he	3547	” And here Rose dropped the pen , and turned away , as though the very paper which was to be her messenger should not see her weep . She had taken up the same pen , and laid it down again fifty times , and had considered and reconsidered the first line of her letter without writing the first word , when Oliver , who had been walking in the streets , with Mr. Giles for a body - guard , entered the room in such breathless haste and violent agitation , as seemed to betoken some new cause of alarm . “
148726	148735	148736	148736	I	0	” asked Rose , advancing to meet him . “
148750	148755	148745	148745	I	0	” replied the boy . “
148784	148785	148777	148777	I	0	” “
148798	148805	148789	148789	you	3547	” said Rose , soothing him . “
148815	148816	148812	148812	you	3547	” “
148823	148832	148820	148821	the gentleman	4594	” replied Oliver , scarcely able to articulate , “
148853	148854	148833	148840	the gentleman who was so good to me	3552	” “
148857	148861	148889	148889	him	4594	” asked Rose . “
148868	148877	148889	148889	him	4594	” replied Oliver , shedding tears of delight , “
148942	148952	148922	148922	Giles	233	” said Oliver , opening a scrap of paper , “
148992	149037	148988	148988	him	4594	” With her attention not a little distracted by these and a great many other incoherent exclamations of joy , Rose read the address , which was Craven Street , in the Strand . She very soon determined upon turning the discovery to account . “
149040	149044	148988	148988	him	4594	” she said . “
149101	149255	149280	149280	your	3563	” Oliver needed no prompting to despatch , and in little more than five minutes they were on their way to Craven Street . When they arrived there , Rose left Oliver in the coach , under pretence of preparing the old gentleman to receive him ; and sending up her card by the servant , requested to see Mr. Brownlow on very pressing business . The servant soon returned , to beg that she would walk upstairs ; and following him into an upper room , Miss Maylie was presented to an elderly gentleman of benevolent appearance , in a bottle - green coat . At no great distance from whom , was seated another old gentleman , in nankeen breeches and gaiters ; who did not look particularly benevolent , and who was sitting with his hands clasped on the top of a thick stick , and his chin propped thereupon . “
149259	149277	149280	149280	your	3563	” said the gentleman , in the bottle - green coat , hastily rising with great politeness , “
149307	149308	149309	149310	Mr. Brownlow	173	” “
149317	149333	149315	149315	sir	4543	” said Rose , glancing from the other gentleman to the one who had spoken . “
149339	149345	149315	149315	sir	4543	” said the old gentleman . “
149365	149366	149357	149357	you	173	” “
149370	149375	149357	149357	you	173	” interposed Miss Maylie , “
149417	149453	149454	149454	I	0	” Mr. Brownlow inclined his head . Mr. Grimwig , who had made one very stiff bow , and risen from his chair , made another very stiff bow , and dropped into it again . “
149466	149473	149454	149454	I	0	” said Rose , naturally embarrassed ; “
149506	149507	149495	149495	you	173	” “
149510	149515	149516	149516	Oliver	123	” said Mr. Brownlow . “
149523	149688	149518	149518	you	173	” replied Rose . The words no sooner escaped her lips , than Mr. Grimwig , who had been affecting to dip into a large book that lay on the table , upset it with a great crash , and falling back in his chair , discharged from his features every expression but one of unmitigated wonder , and indulged in a prolonged and vacant stare ; then , as if ashamed of having betrayed so much emotion , he jerked himself , as it were , by a convulsion into his former attitude , and looking out straight before him emitted a long deep whistle , which seemed , at last , not to be discharged on empty air , but to die away in the innermost recesses of his stomach . Mr. Browlow was no less surprised , although his astonishment was not expressed in the same eccentric manner . He drew his chair nearer to Miss Maylie ’s , and said , “
149763	149764	149753	149753	Heaven	218	” “
149782	149801	149769	149769	I	0	” growled Mr. Grimwig , speaking by some ventriloquial power , without moving a muscle of his face . “
149815	149821	149804	149813	a child of a noble nature and a warm heart	3576	” said Rose , colouring ; “
149859	149860	149861	149861	I	0	” “
149868	149879	149861	149861	I	0	” said Mr. Grimwig , with the same rigid face . “
149909	149910	149899	149899	I	0	” “
149920	149925	149926	149926	he	3575	” said Mr. Brownlow ; “
149934	149935	149938	149938	he	3575	” “
149941	149946	149938	149938	he	3575	” growled Mr. Grimwig . “
149953	149966	149949	149949	he	3575	” said Mr. Brownlow , obviously rising in wrath as he spoke . “
149978	149983	149974	149974	he	3575	” growled Mr. Grimwig . “
149997	150002	149994	149994	he	3575	” said Mr. Brownlow . “
150017	150053	150004	150004	he	3575	” responded Mr. Grimwig , knocking his stick upon the floor . Having gone thus far , the two old gentlemen severally took snuff , and afterwards shook hands , according to their invariable custom . “
150059	150064	150004	150004	he	3575	” said Mr. Brownlow , “
150147	150222	150224	150224	God	171	” Rose , who had had time to collect her thoughts , at once related , in a few natural words , all that had befallen Oliver since he left Mr. Brownlow ’s house ; reserving Nancy ’s information for that gentleman ’s private ear , and concluding with the assurance that his only sorrow , for some months past , had been not being able to meet with his former benefactor and friend . “
150226	150232	150224	150224	God	171	” said the old gentleman . “
150271	150272	150273	150273	He	2760	” “
150283	150287	150273	150273	He	2760	” replied Rose . “
150292	150414	150273	150273	He	2760	” cried the old gentleman . With which he hurried out of the room , down the stairs , up the coachsteps , and into the coach , without another word . When the room - door closed behind him , Mr. Grimwig lifted up his head , and converting one of the hind legs of his chair into a pivot , described three distinct circles with the assistance of his stick and the table ; sitting in it all the time . After performing this evolution , he rose and limped as fast as he could up and down the room at least a dozen times , and then stopping suddenly before Rose , kissed her without the slightest preface . “
150417	150434	150273	150273	He	2760	” he said , as the young lady rose in some alarm at this unusual proceeding . “
150463	150526	150460	150460	they	3589	” In fact , as he threw himself at one dexterous dive into his former seat , Mr. Brownlow returned , accompanied by Oliver , whom Mr. Grimwig received very graciously ; and if the gratification of that moment had been the only reward for all her anxiety and care in Oliver ’s behalf , Rose Maylie would have been well repaid . “
150541	150550	150529	150539	somebody else who should not be forgotten , by the bye	3590	” said Mr. Brownlow , ringing the bell . “
150560	150583	150552	150553	Mrs. Bedwin	178	” The old housekeeper answered the summons with all dispatch ; and dropping a curtsey at the door , waited for orders . “
150594	150602	150592	150592	Bedwin	178	” said Mr. Brownlow , rather testily . “
150611	150617	150606	150606	I	0	” replied the old lady . “
150636	150637	150634	150634	sir	4543	” “
150645	150650	150634	150634	sir	4543	” rejoined Mr. Brownlow ; “
150674	150713	150714	150714	God	171	” The old lady began to rummage in her pocket for her spectacles . But Oliver ’s patience was not proof against this new trial ; and yielding to his first impulse , he sprang into her arms . “
150720	150729	150714	150714	God	171	” cried the old lady , embracing him ; “
150736	150737	150714	150714	God	171	” “
150743	150747	150714	150714	God	171	” cried Oliver . “
150758	150770	150748	150748	He	3595	” said the old lady , holding him in her arms . “
150860	151190	150827	150827	his	3595	” Running on thus , and now holding Oliver from her to mark how he had grown , now clasping him to her and passing her fingers fondly through his hair , the good soul laughed and wept upon his neck by turns . Leaving her and Oliver to compare notes at leisure , Mr. Brownlow led the way into another room ; and there , heard from Rose a full narration of her interview with Nancy , which occasioned him no little surprise and perplexity . Rose also explained her reasons for not confiding in her friend Mr. Losberne in the first instance . The old gentleman considered that she had acted prudently , and readily undertook to hold solemn conference with the worthy doctor himself . To afford him an early opportunity for the execution of this design , it was arranged that he should call at the hotel at eight o’clock that evening , and that in the meantime Mrs. Maylie should be cautiously informed of all that had occurred . These preliminaries adjusted , Rose and Oliver returned home . Rose had by no means overrated the measure of the good doctor ’s wrath . Nancy ’s history was no sooner unfolded to him , than he poured forth a shower of mingled threats and execrations ; threatened to make her the first victim of the combined ingenuity of Messrs. Blathers and Duff ; and actually put on his hat preparatory to sallying forth to obtain the assistance of those worthies . And , doubtless , he would , in this first outbreak , have carried the intention into effect without a moment ’s consideration of the consequences , if he had not been restrained , in part , by corresponding violence on the side of Mr. Brownlow , who was himself of an irascible temperament , and partly by such arguments and representations as seemed best calculated to dissuade him from his hotbrained purpose . “
151200	151214	150827	150827	his	3595	” said the impetuous doctor , when they had rejoined the two ladies . “
151264	151265	150827	150827	his	3595	” “
151270	151277	150827	150827	his	3595	” rejoined Mr. Brownlow , laughing ; “
151288	151289	150827	150827	his	3595	” “
151294	151299	150827	150827	his	3595	” exclaimed the doctor . “
151309	151310	151300	151300	I	0	” “
151315	151320	151300	151300	I	0	” interposed Mr. Brownlow . “
151338	151339	151300	151300	I	0	” “
151343	151348	151300	151300	I	0	” asked the doctor . “
151379	151380	151300	151300	I	0	” “
151383	151396	151300	151300	I	0	” said Mr. Losberne , cooling himself with his pocket - handkerchief ; “
151402	151403	151300	151300	I	0	” “
151407	151412	151300	151300	I	0	” pursued Mr. Brownlow ; “
151446	151447	151442	151442	we	3602	” “
151460	151465	151442	151442	we	3602	” suggested the doctor , “
151471	151472	151442	151442	we	3602	” “
151476	151483	151442	151442	we	3602	” replied Mr. Brownlow , smiling ; “
151544	151545	151535	151535	Oliver	123	” “
151548	151553	151535	151535	Oliver	123	” inquired the doctor . “
151713	151714	151724	151724	I	0	” “
151717	151723	151724	151724	I	0	” said the doctor impetuously , “
151760	151761	151732	151732	you	3612	” “
151775	151789	151732	151732	you	3612	” said Mr. Brownlow , interrupting Rose as she was about to speak . “
151940	151996	151997	151997	I	0	” Although Mr. Losberne received with many wry faces a proposal involving a delay of five whole days , he was fain to admit that no better course occurred to him just then ; and as both Rose and Mrs. Maylie sided very strongly with Mr. Brownlow , that gentleman ’s proposition was carried unanimously . “
152001	152005	151997	151997	I	0	” he said , “
152082	152083	152084	152084	I	0	” “
152101	152106	152095	152095	I	0	” said the doctor . “
152115	152120	152128	152129	That lady	5125	” replied Mr. Brownlow , “
152126	152127	152128	152129	That lady	5125	” “
152142	152200	152138	152140	very old friend	3628	” said the doctor , motioning towards Mrs. Maylie , and concluding with an expressive glance at her niece . Rose blushed deeply , but she did not make any audible objection to this motion ( possibly she felt in a hopeless minority ) ; and Harry Maylie and Mr. Grimwig were accordingly added to the committee . “
152209	152214	152201	152201	We	3602	” said Mrs. Maylie , “
152278	152279	152270	152270	you	3631	” “
152282	152287	152270	152270	you	3631	” rejoined Mr. Brownlow . “
152440	152824	152830	152830	yer	3637	” With these words , the old gentleman gave his hand to Mrs. Maylie , and escorted her into the supper - room . Mr. Losberne followed , leading Rose ; and the council was , for the present , effectually broken up . CHAPTER XLII . AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE OF OLIVER ’S , EXHIBITING DECIDED MARKS OF GENIUS , BECOMES A PUBLIC CHARACTER IN THE METROPOLIS Upon the night when Nancy , having lulled Mr. Sikes to sleep , hurried on her self - imposed mission to Rose Maylie , there advanced towards London , by the Great North Road , two persons , upon whom it is expedient that this history should bestow some attention . They were a man and woman ; or perhaps they would be better described as a male and female : for the former was one of those long - limbed , knock - kneed , shambling , bony people , to whom it is difficult to assign any precise age,—looking as they do , when they are yet boys , like undergrown men , and when they are almost men , like overgrown boys . The woman was young , but of a robust and hardy make , as she need have been to bear the weight of the heavy bundle which was strapped to her back . Her companion was not encumbered with much luggage , as there merely dangled from a stick which he carried over his shoulder , a small parcel wrapped in a common handkerchief , and apparently light enough . This circumstance , added to the length of his legs , which were of unusual extent , enabled him with much ease to keep some half - dozen paces in advance of his companion , to whom he occasionally turned with an impatient jerk of the head : as if reproaching her tardiness , and urging her to greater exertion . Thus , they had toiled along the dusty road , taking little heed of any object within sight , save when they stepped aside to allow a wider passage for the mail - coaches which were whirling out of town , until they passed through Highgate archway ; when the foremost traveller stopped and called impatiently to his companion , “
152840	152841	152838	152838	Charlotte	144	” “
152853	152866	152848	152848	I	0	” said the female , coming up , almost breathless with fatigue . “
152881	152901	152871	152871	yer	3637	” rejoined the male traveller , changing his own little bundle as he spoke , to the other shoulder . “
152932	152933	152925	152925	I	0	” “
152939	152961	152925	152925	I	0	” asked the woman , resting herself against a bank , and looking up with the perspiration streaming from her face . “
152971	152984	152965	152965	Yer	3637	” said the long - legged tramper , pointing out before him . “
152995	152996	153018	153018	they	3639	” “
153008	153014	153018	153018	they	3639	” said the woman despondingly . “
153027	153037	153018	153018	they	3639	” said Noah Claypole ; for he it was ; “
153058	153104	153053	153053	I	0	” As Noah ’s red nose grew redder with anger , and as he crossed the road while speaking , as if fully prepared to put his threat into execution , the woman rose without any further remark , and trudged onward by his side . “
153117	153130	153107	153107	you	0	” she asked , after they had walked a few hundred yards . “
153136	153149	153133	153133	I	0	” replied Noah , whose temper had been considerably impaired by walking . “
153155	153159	153152	153152	I	0	” said Charlotte . “
153165	153170	153152	153152	I	0	” replied Mr. Claypole . “
153182	153183	153152	153152	I	0	” “
153187	153188	153152	153152	I	0	” “
153214	153221	153194	153194	I	0	” replied Mr. Claypole with dignity . “
153231	153236	153224	153224	you	0	” said his companion . “
153292	153301	153267	153267	he	3642	” said Mr. Claypole in a jeering tone . “
153400	153401	153397	153398	a fool	440	” “
153413	153417	153404	153404	I	0	” replied Charlotte ; “
153449	153450	153451	153451	Yer	80	” “
153464	153469	153451	153451	Yer	80	” said Mr. Claypole . “
153480	153484	153476	153476	Noah	146	” rejoined Charlotte . “
153490	153495	153498	153498	you	0	” asked Mr. Claypole . “
153517	153867	153514	153514	you	0	” said the lady , chucking him under the chin , and drawing her arm through his . This was indeed the case ; but as it was not Mr. Claypole ’s habit to repose a blind and foolish confidence in anybody , it should be observed , in justice to that gentleman , that he had trusted Charlotte to this extent , in order that , if they were pursued , the money might be found on her : which would leave him an opportunity of asserting his innocence of any theft , and would greatly facilitate his chances of escape . Of course , he entered at this juncture , into no explanation of his motives , and they walked on very lovingly together . In pursuance of this cautious plan , Mr. Claypole went on , without halting , until he arrived at the Angel at Islington , where he wisely judged , from the crowd of passengers and numbers of vehicles , that London began in earnest . Just pausing to observe which appeared the most crowded streets , and consequently the most to be avoided , he crossed into Saint John ’s Road , and was soon deep in the obscurity of the intricate and dirty ways , which , lying between Gray ’s Inn Lane and Smithfield , render that part of the town one of the lowest and worst that improvement has left in the midst of London . Through these streets , Noah Claypole walked , dragging Charlotte after him ; now stepping into the kennel to embrace at a glance the whole external character of some small public - house ; now jogging on again , as some fancied appearance induced him to believe it too public for his purpose . At length , he stopped in front of one , more humble in appearance and more dirty than any he had yet seen ; and , having crossed over and surveyed it from the opposite pavement , graciously announced his intention of putting up there , for the night . “
153874	153893	153514	153514	you	0	” said Noah , unstrapping it from the woman ’s shoulders , and slinging it over his own ; “
153923	153924	153925	153925	Cripples	225	” “
153927	153931	153932	153933	Three Cripples	225	” said Charlotte . “
153935	153939	153932	153933	Three Cripples	225	” repeated Noah , “
153961	154094	154097	154099	the Three Cripples	3656	” With these injunctions , he pushed the rattling door with his shoulder , and entered the house , followed by his companion . There was nobody in the bar but a young Jew , who , with his two elbows on the counter , was reading a dirty newspaper . He stared very hard at Noah , and Noah stared very hard at him . If Noah had been attired in his charity - boy ’s dress , there might have been some reason for the Jew opening his eyes so wide ; but as he had discarded the coat and badge , and wore a short smock - frock over his leathers , there seemed no particular reason for his appearance exciting so much attention in a public - house . “
154101	154105	154097	154099	the Three Cripples	3656	” asked Noah . “
154115	154120	154121	154133	A gentleman we met on the road , coming up from the country	3658	” replied the Jew . “
154139	154170	154121	154133	A gentleman we met on the road , coming up from the country	3658	” said Noah , nudging Charlotte , perhaps to call her attention to this most ingenious device for attracting respect , and perhaps to warn her to betray no surprise . “
154178	154179	154121	154133	A gentleman we met on the road , coming up from the country	3658	” “
154186	154196	154121	154133	A gentleman we met on the road , coming up from the country	3658	” said Barney , who was the attendant sprite ; “
154202	154203	154198	154198	I	0	” “
154229	154458	154227	154227	yer	3664	” said Noah . Barney complied by ushering them into a small back - room , and setting the required viands before them ; having done which , he informed the travellers that they could be lodged that night , and left the amiable couple to their refreshment . Now , this back - room was immediately behind the bar , and some steps lower , so that any person connected with the house , undrawing a small curtain which concealed a single pane of glass fixed in the wall of the last - named apartment , about five feet from its flooring , could not only look down upon any guests in the back - room without any great hazard of being observed ( the glass being in a dark angle of the wall , between which and a large upright beam the observer had to thrust himself ) , but could , by applying his ear to the partition , ascertain with tolerable distinctness , their subject of conversation . The landlord of the house had not withdrawn his eye from this place of espial for five minutes , and Barney had only just returned from making the communication above related , when Fagin , in the course of his evening ’s business , came into the bar to inquire after some of his young pupils . “
154461	154465	154227	154227	yer	3664	” said Barney : “
154473	154474	154475	154475	Strangers	3666	” “
154477	154486	154475	154475	Strangers	3666	” repeated the old man in a whisper . “
154494	154498	154499	154501	Frob the cuttry	269	” added Barney . “
154513	154582	154510	154510	I’b	3668	” Fagin appeared to receive this communication with great interest . Mounting a stool , he cautiously applied his eye to the pane of glass , from which secret post he could see Mr. Claypole taking cold beef from the dish , and porter from the pot , and administering homeopathic doses of both to Charlotte , who sat patiently by , eating and drinking at his pleasure . “
154585	154594	154595	154595	I	0	” he whispered , looking round to Barney , “
154644	154684	154640	154640	me	0	” He again applied his eye to the glass , and turning his ear to the partition , listened attentively : with a subtle and eager look upon his face , that might have appertained to some old goblin . “
154693	154720	154686	154686	I	0	” said Mr. Claypole , kicking out his legs , and continuing a conversation , the commencement of which Fagin had arrived too late to hear . “
154749	154750	154751	154751	I	0	” “
154760	154764	154751	154751	I	0	” replied Charlotte ; “
154784	154785	154776	154782	people to get clear off after it	3678	” “
154790	154795	154776	154782	people to get clear off after it	3678	” said Mr. Claypole ; “
154806	154807	154810	154810	you	0	” “
154813	154818	154819	154819	Pockets	270	” asked his companion . “
154833	154843	154810	154810	you	0	” said Mr. Claypole , rising with the porter . “
154854	154858	154845	154845	you	4730	” said Charlotte . “
154872	154876	154859	154859	I	0	” replied Noah . “
154918	154919	154920	154920	Lor	125	” “
154932	154944	154920	154920	Lor	125	” exclaimed Charlotte , imprinting a kiss upon his ugly face . “
154966	154976	154977	154977	I	0	” said Noah , disengaging himself with great gravity . “
155059	155168	155173	155173	sir	4543	” After expressing this opinion , Mr. Claypole looked into the porter - pot with an aspect of deep wisdom ; and having well shaken its contents , nodded condescendingly to Charlotte , and took a draught , wherewith he appeared greatly refreshed . He was meditating another , when the sudden opening of the door , and the appearance of a stranger , interrupted him . The stranger was Mr. Fagin . And very amiable he looked , and a very low bow he made , as he advanced , and setting himself down at the nearest table , ordered something to drink of the grinning Barney . “
155183	155191	155173	155173	sir	4543	” said Fagin , rubbing his hands . “
155201	155202	155199	155199	sir	4543	” “
155209	155214	155205	155205	yer	4543	” asked Noah Claypole . “
155226	155249	155215	155215	We	3694	” replied Fagin , pointing from Noah ’s shoes to those of his companion , and from them to the two bundles . “
155255	155259	155250	155250	Yer	4543	” said Noah . “
155270	155271	155268	155268	Charlotte	144	” “
155285	155298	155282	155283	my dear	4649	” replied the Jew , sinking his voice to a confidential whisper ; “
155305	155383	155282	155283	my dear	4649	” Fagin followed up this remark by striking the side of his nose with his right forefinger,—a gesture which Noah attempted to imitate , though not with complete success , in consequence of his own nose not being large enough for the purpose . However , Mr. Fagin seemed to interpret the endeavour as expressing a perfect coincidence with his opinion , and put about the liquor which Barney reappeared with , in a very friendly manner . “
155388	155397	155398	155398	Dear	4730	” observed Mr. Claypole , smacking his lips . “
155400	155404	155398	155398	Dear	4730	” said Fagin . “
155444	155481	155487	155488	my dear	4649	” Mr. Claypole no sooner heard this extract from his own remarks than he fell back in his chair , and looked from the Jew to Charlotte with a countenance of ashy paleness and excessive terror . “
155490	155499	155485	155485	me	0	” said Fagin , drawing his chair closer . “
155526	155527	155524	155524	me	0	” “
155534	155562	155528	155528	I	0	” stammered Noah , no longer stretching out his legs like an independent gentleman , but coiling them up as well as he could under his chair ; “
155581	155582	155574	155574	Charlotte	144	” “
155598	155619	155574	155574	Charlotte	144	” replied Fagin , glancing , nevertheless , with a hawk ’s eye at the girl and the two bundles . “
155634	155635	155628	155628	I	0	” “
155640	155649	155628	155628	I	0	” asked Mr. Claypole , a little recovering . “
155656	155660	155628	155628	I	0	” rejoined Fagin ; “
155744	155788	155789	155789	I	0	” Noah Claypole ’s mind might have been at ease after this assurance , but his body certainly was not ; for he shuffled and writhed about , into various uncouth positions : eyeing his new friend meanwhile with mingled fear and suspicion . “
155795	155815	155789	155789	I	0	” said Fagin , after he had reassured the girl , by dint of friendly nods and muttered encouragements . “
155863	155864	155865	155865	Yer	4649	” “
155874	155878	155869	155869	yer	4649	” replied Noah . “
155891	155899	155869	155869	yer	4649	” inquired Fagin , shrugging his shoulders . “
155911	155912	155903	155903	me	0	” “
155923	155936	155937	155937	She	3714	” said Noah , getting his legs by gradual degrees abroad again . “
155953	155995	155946	155946	Charlotte	144	” This mandate , which had been delivered with great majesty , was obeyed without the slightest demur ; and Charlotte made the best of her way off with the packages while Noah held the door open and watched her out . “
156007	156029	156005	156005	she	3714	” he asked as he resumed his seat : in the tone of a keeper who had tamed some wild animal . “
156033	156043	156005	156005	she	3714	” rejoined Fagin , clapping him on the shoulder . “
156052	156053	156046	156047	a genius	3716	” “
156069	156073	156063	156063	I	0	” replied Noah . “
156088	156089	156076	156076	I	0	” “
156097	156101	156094	156094	you	0	” said Fagin . “
156118	156119	156094	156094	you	0	” “
156135	156146	156121	156121	he	4664	” responded Noah , winking one of his little eyes . “
156168	156169	156170	156173	Regular town - maders	3720	” “
156175	156180	156192	156192	he	4664	” asked Mr. Claypole . “
156214	156218	156203	156203	he	4664	” replied Fagin . “
156226	156236	156220	156220	I	0	” said Noah , slapping his breeches - pocket . “
156245	156255	156220	156220	I	0	” replied Fagin , in a most decided manner . “
156268	156269	156220	156220	I	0	” “
156284	156288	156277	156277	you	0	” retorted Fagin . “
156334	156335	156321	156321	he	4664	” “
156342	156347	156321	156321	he	4664	” asked Noah doubtfully . “
156351	156352	156321	156321	he	4664	” “
156355	156356	156321	156321	he	4664	” “
156359	156360	156321	156321	he	4664	” “
156363	156367	156321	156321	he	4664	” said Noah . “
156373	156374	156321	156321	he	4664	” “
156404	156496	156399	156401	the young woman	326	” replied Mr. Fagin . Whether Noah Claypole , whose rapacity was none of the least comprehensive , would have acceded even to these glowing terms , had he been a perfectly free agent , is very doubtful ; but as he recollected that , in the event of his refusal , it was in the power of his new acquaintance to give him up to justice immediately ( and more unlikely things had come to pass ) , he gradually relented , and said he thought that would suit him . “
156502	156506	156508	156508	she	3728	” observed Noah , “
156527	156528	156553	156553	you	3727	” “
156534	156538	156553	156553	you	3727	” suggested Fagin . “
156546	156550	156553	156553	you	3727	” replied Noah . “
156583	156584	156587	156587	you	0	” “
156602	156606	156587	156587	you	0	” said Fagin . “
156620	156621	156610	156615	somebody who would do that well	3731	” “
156641	156647	156630	156630	I	0	” rejoined Mr. Claypole slowly ; “
156659	156660	156654	156654	itself	3732	” “
156665	156676	156654	156654	itself	3732	” observed the Jew , ruminating or pretending to ruminate . “
156683	156684	156654	156654	itself	3732	” “
156692	156700	156687	156687	you	3727	” asked Noah , anxiously regarding him . “
156724	156725	156687	156687	you	3727	” “
156735	156739	156728	156728	you	3727	” asked Fagin . “
156761	156762	156765	156765	they	2331	” “
156776	156784	156765	156765	they	2331	” asked Noah , shaking his head . “
156803	156804	156765	156765	they	2331	” “
156807	156819	156820	156822	The kinchin lay	3735	” said Fagin , laying his hand on Noah ’s knee . “
156824	156825	156820	156822	The kinchin lay	3735	” “
156830	156835	156836	156837	The kinchins	3736	” demanded Mr. Claypole . “
156842	156846	156836	156837	The kinchins	3736	” said Fagin , “
156919	156920	156876	156876	they’ve	3738	” “
156925	156938	156876	156876	they’ve	3738	” roared Mr. Claypole , kicking up his legs in an ecstasy . “
156947	156948	156876	156876	they’ve	3738	” “
156955	156959	156876	156876	they’ve	3738	” replied Fagin ; “
157013	157038	157072	157072	ten	3747	” With this , Fagin poked Mr. Claypole in the side , and they joined in a burst of laughter both long and loud . “
157046	157061	157072	157072	ten	3747	” said Noah , when he had recovered himself , and Charlotte had returned . “
157069	157070	157072	157072	ten	3747	” “
157075	157087	157072	157072	ten	3747	” asked Fagin , adding , as Mr. Claypole nodded assent , “
157097	157098	157091	157091	I	0	” “
157102	157114	157099	157100	Mr. Bolter	271	” replied Noah , who had prepared himself for such emergency . “
157124	157125	157121	157122	Mrs. Bolter	272	” “
157132	157141	157126	157127	Mrs. Bolter	272	” said Fagin , bowing with grotesque politeness . “
157152	157153	157157	157158	the gentleman	4594	” “
157162	157167	157157	157158	the gentleman	4594	” thundered Mr. Claypole . “
157174	157183	157184	157184	She	272	” replied Mrs. Bolter , extending her hand . “
157198	157211	157184	157184	She	272	” said Mr. Morris Bolter , late Claypole , turning to Fagin . “
157215	157216	157212	157212	You	0	” “
157225	157235	157220	157220	I	0	” replied Fagin , telling the truth for once . “
157244	157335	157220	157220	I	0	” With many adieus and good wishes , Mr. Fagin went his way . Noah Claypole , bespeaking his good lady ’s attention , proceeded to enlighten her relative to the arrangement he had made , with all that haughtiness and air of superiority , becoming , not only a member of the sterner sex , but a gentleman who appreciated the dignity of a special appointment on the kinchin lay , in London and its vicinity . CHAPTER XLIII . WHEREIN IS SHOWN HOW THE ARTFUL DODGER GOT INTO TROUBLE “
157350	157380	157381	157381	Cod	80	” asked Mr. Claypole , otherwise Bolter , when , by virtue of the compact entered into between them , he had removed next day to Fagin ’s house . “
157390	157391	157381	157381	Cod	80	” “
157402	157412	157395	157395	his	3753	” replied Fagin , with his most insinuating grin . “

157429	157444	157413	157413	He	3753	” replied Morris Bolter , assuming the air of a man of the world . “
157458	157459	157413	157413	He	3753	” “
157465	157469	157413	157413	He	3753	” said Fagin . “

157524	157529	157535	157536	Some conjurers	3763	” replied Mr. Bolter . “

157572	157577	157561	157561	It	3766	” cried Mr. Bolter . “

157595	157608	157611	157614	a general number one	3770	” said Fagin , who felt it necessary to qualify this position , “
157631	157632	157611	157614	a general number one	3770	” “
157638	157643	157611	157614	a general number one	3770	” exclaimed Mr. Bolter . “
157647	157657	157611	157614	a general number one	3770	” pursued Fagin , affecting to disregard this interruption , “
157694	157695	157692	157692	yourself	3772	” “
157698	157703	157692	157692	yourself	3772	” replied Mr. Bolter . “
157709	157710	157704	157704	Yer	3772	” “
157733	157734	157713	157713	You	3772	” “
157741	157756	157738	157738	you	3772	” said Mr. Bolter , who was largely endowed with the quality of selfishness . “
157763	157767	157759	157759	I	0	” retorted Fagin . “
157783	157784	157785	157785	I	0	” “
157788	157793	157785	157785	I	0	” interrupted Mr. Bolter , “
157823	157824	157794	157794	yer	3772	” “
157828	157842	157794	157794	yer	3772	” said Fagin , shrugging his shoulders , and stretching out his hands ; “
157898	157929	157858	157858	I	0	” Mr. Bolter put his hand to his neckerchief , as if he felt it inconveniently tight ; and murmured an assent , qualified in tone but not in substance . “
157933	157937	157858	157858	I	0	” continued Fagin , “
157995	157996	158010	158010	yer	3772	” “
158002	158007	158010	158010	yer	3772	” replied Mr. Bolter . “

158027	158036	158010	158010	yer	3772	” said the Jew , raising his eyebrows . “
158131	158132	158148	158151	a cunning old codger	3781	” “
158137	158144	158148	158151	a cunning old codger	3781	” rejoined Mr. Bolter , thoughtfully . “
158153	158290	158148	158151	a cunning old codger	3781	” Mr. Fagin saw , with delight , that this tribute to his powers was no mere compliment , but that he had really impressed his recruit with a sense of his wily genius , which it was most important that he should entertain in the outset of their acquaintance . To strengthen an impression so desirable and useful , he followed up the blow by acquainting him , in some detail , with the magnitude and extent of his operations ; blending truth and fiction together , as best served his purpose ; and bringing both to bear , with so much art , that Mr. Bolter ’s respect visibly increased , and became tempered , at the same time , with a degree of wholesome fear , which it was highly desirable to awaken . “
158308	158312	158313	158313	My	0	” said Fagin . “
158324	158325	158326	158326	You	0	” “
158335	158340	158326	158326	You	0	” cried Mr. Bolter . “
158345	158349	158326	158326	You	0	” replied Fagin , “

158370	158371	158367	158367	he	3782	” “
158374	158378	158381	158381	he	3782	” interposed Fagin . “
158385	158386	158381	158381	he	3782	” “
158390	158395	158381	158381	he	3782	” inquired Mr. Bolter . “
158398	158402	158381	158381	he	3782	” replied Fagin , “
158500	158501	158497	158498	the Dodger	1138	” “
158519	158524	158515	158515	yer	0	” said Mr. Bolter . “
158531	158539	158525	158525	I	0	” replied Fagin , with a sigh . “

158621	158626	158613	158613	you	0	” demanded Mr. Bolter . “
158651	158684	158642	158642	yer	0	” Fagin was about to translate these mysterious expressions into the vulgar tongue ; and , being interpreted , Mr. Bolter would have been informed that they represented that combination of words , “
158689	158725	158642	158642	yer	0	” when the dialogue was cut short by the entry of Master Bates , with his hands in his breeches - pockets , and his face twisted into a look of semi - comical woe . “
158733	158751	158731	158731	Fagin	161	” said Charley , when he and his new companion had been made known to each other . “
158757	158758	158754	158754	you	0	” “
158791	158796	158797	158797	I	0	” replied Master Bates . “
158911	158938	158880	158880	he	3794	” With this expression of feeling for his unfortunate friend , Master Bates sat himself on the nearest chair with an aspect of chagrin and despondency . “
158952	158964	158941	158941	you	3802	” exclaimed Fagin , darting an angry look at his pupil . “
158996	158997	158981	158981	you	3802	” “
159001	159014	158981	158981	you	3802	” replied Master Bates , in a voice rendered husky by regret ; “
159018	159019	158981	158981	you	3802	” “
159027	159032	159035	159035	you	3802	” replied Fagin angrily ; “
159039	159040	159035	159035	you	3802	” “
159054	159073	159035	159035	you	3802	” said Charley , chafed into perfect defiance of his venerable friend by the current of his regrets ; “
159126	159127	159220	159220	Charley	164	” “
159132	159161	159220	159220	Charley	164	” cried Fagin , extending his right hand , and turning to Mr. Bolter in a fit of chuckling which shook him as though he had the palsy ; “
159180	159216	159220	159220	Charley	164	” Mr. Bolter nodded assent , and Fagin , after contemplating the grief of Charley Bates for some seconds with evident satisfaction , stepped up to that young gentleman and patted him on the shoulder . “
159222	159227	159220	159220	Charley	164	” said Fagin soothingly ; “
159289	159290	159278	159278	Charley	164	” “
159300	159308	159278	159278	Charley	164	” said Charley , a little consoled . “
159316	159321	159278	159278	Charley	164	” continued the Jew . “
159365	159366	159370	159370	he	3806	” “
159373	159378	159382	159382	he	3806	” cried Charley Bates . “
159385	159389	159382	159382	he	3806	” replied Fagin , “
159457	159458	159453	159453	Charley	164	” “
159463	159468	159453	159453	Charley	164	” laughed Master Bates , “
159495	159496	159493	159493	he	3806	” “
159499	159503	159493	159493	he	3806	” cried Fagin . “
159510	159511	159507	159507	he	3806	” “
159522	159530	159531	159531	I	0	” repeated Charley , rubbing his hands . “
159538	159550	159533	159533	I	0	” cried the Jew , bending his eyes upon his pupil . “
159555	159560	159553	159553	I	0	” cried Charley Bates . “
159635	159718	159719	159719	We	3818	” In fact , Mr. Fagin had so well humoured his young friend ’s eccentric disposition , that Master Bates , who had at first been disposed to consider the imprisoned Dodger rather in the light of a victim , now looked upon him as the chief actor in a scene of most uncommon and exquisite humour , and felt quite impatient for the arrival of the time when his old companion should have so favourable an opportunity of displaying his abilities . “
159735	159739	159741	159741	me	0	” said Fagin . “
159744	159745	159741	159741	me	0	” “
159750	159754	159741	159741	me	0	” asked Charley . “
159760	159764	159741	159741	me	0	” replied Fagin . “
159800	159801	159802	159802	You	164	” “
159813	159821	159802	159802	You	164	” said Charley with a humorous leer . “
159828	159835	159802	159802	You	164	” replied Fagin shaking his head . “
159846	159859	159840	159840	you	0	” asked Master Bates , laying his hand on Noah ’s arm . “
159864	159865	159860	159860	Nobody	316	” “
159874	159878	159869	159869	he	3821	” observed Fagin . “
159881	159885	159869	159869	he	3821	” interposed Charley . “
159893	159894	159888	159888	he	3821	” “
159901	159910	159888	159888	he	3821	” said Fagin , turning to Mr. Bolter , “
159914	159915	159888	159888	he	3821	” “
159927	159947	159918	159918	I	0	” observed Noah , backing towards the door , and shaking his head with a kind of sober alarm . “
159967	159968	159960	159960	my	0	” “
159977	159991	159972	159972	he	3821	” inquired Master Bates , surveying Noah ’s lank form with much disgust . “
160018	160019	160015	160015	his	3821	” “
160023	160028	160015	160015	his	3821	” retorted Mr. Bolter ; “
160051	160713	160043	160043	yer’ll	3827	” Master Bates laughed so vehemently at this magnificent threat , that it was some time before Fagin could interpose , and represent to Mr. Bolter that he incurred no possible danger in visiting the police - office ; that , inasmuch as no account of the little affair in which he had engaged , nor any description of his person , had yet been forwarded to the metropolis , it was very probable that he was not even suspected of having resorted to it for shelter ; and that , if he were properly disguised , it would be as safe a spot for him to visit as any in London , inasmuch as it would be , of all places , the very last , to which he could be supposed likely to resort of his own free will . Persuaded , in part , by these representations , but overborne in a much greater degree by his fear of Fagin , Mr. Bolter at length consented , with a very bad grace , to undertake the expedition . By Fagin ’s directions , he immediately substituted for his own attire , a waggoner ’s frock , velveteen breeches , and leather leggings : all of which articles the Jew had at hand . He was likewise furnished with a felt hat well garnished with turnpike tickets ; and a carter ’s whip . Thus equipped , he was to saunter into the office , as some country fellow from Covent Garden market might be supposed to do for the gratification of his curiousity ; and as he was as awkward , ungainly , and raw - boned a fellow as need be , Mr. Fagin had no fear but that he would look the part to perfection . These arrangements completed , he was informed of the necessary signs and tokens by which to recognise the Artful Dodger , and was conveyed by Master Bates through dark and winding ways to within a very short distance of Bow Street . Having described the precise situation of the office , and accompanied it with copious directions how he was to walk straight up the passage , and when he got into the side , and pull off his hat as he went into the room , Charley Bates bade him hurry on alone , and promised to bide his return on the spot of their parting . Noah Claypole , or Morris Bolter as the reader pleases , punctually followed the directions he had received , which — Master Bates being pretty well acquainted with the locality — were so exact that he was enabled to gain the magisterial presence without asking any question , or meeting with any interruption by the way . He found himself jostled among a crowd of people , chiefly women , who were huddled together in a dirty frowsy room , at the upper end of which was a raised platform railed off from the rest , with a dock for the prisoners on the left hand against the wall , a box for the witnesses in the middle , and a desk for the magistrates on the right ; the awful locality last named , being screened off by a partition which concealed the bench from the common gaze , and left the vulgar to imagine ( if they could ) the full majesty of justice . There were only a couple of women in the dock , who were nodding to their admiring friends , while the clerk read some depositions to a couple of policemen and a man in plain clothes who leant over the table . A jailer stood reclining against the dock - rail , tapping his nose listlessly with a large key , except when he repressed an undue tendency to conversation among the idlers , by proclaiming silence ; or looked sternly up to bid some woman “
160719	161028	160043	160043	yer’ll	3827	” when the gravity of justice was disturbed by feeble cries , half - smothered in the mother ’s shawl , from some meagre infant . The room smelt close and unwholesome ; the walls were dirt - discoloured ; and the ceiling blackened . There was an old smoky bust over the mantel - shelf , and a dusty clock above the dock — the only thing present , that seemed to go on as it ought ; for depravity , or poverty , or an habitual acquaintance with both , had left a taint on all the animate matter , hardly less unpleasant than the thick greasy scum on every inanimate object that frowned upon it . Noah looked eagerly about him for the Dodger ; but although there were several women who would have done very well for that distinguished character ’s mother or sister , and more than one man who might be supposed to bear a strong resemblance to his father , nobody at all answering the description given him of Mr. Dawkins was to be seen . He waited in a state of much suspense and uncertainty until the women , being committed for trial , went flaunting out ; and then was quickly relieved by the appearance of another prisoner who he felt at once could be no other than the object of his visit . It was indeed Mr. Dawkins , who , shuffling into the office with the big coat sleeves tucked up as usual , his left hand in his pocket , and his hat in his right hand , preceded the jailer , with a rolling gait altogether indescribable , and , taking his place in the dock , requested in an audible voice to know what he was placed in that ’ ere disgraceful sitivation for . “
161036	161041	161034	161034	you	3831	” said the jailer . “
161051	161056	161049	161049	I	0	” rejoined the Dodger . “
161062	161063	161059	161060	my priwileges	3833	” “
161072	161077	161064	161064	You	3831	” retorted the jailer , “
161083	161084	161085	161085	We	3834	” “
161110	161115	161106	161106	I	0	” replied Mr. Dawkins . “
161215	161245	161249	161249	them	3837	” At this point , the Dodger , with a show of being very particular with a view to proceedings to be had thereafter , desired the jailer to communicate “
161258	161284	161249	161249	them	3837	” Which so tickled the spectators , that they laughed almost as heartily as Master Bates could have done if he had heard the request . “
161288	161293	161249	161249	them	3837	” cried the jailer . “
161298	161305	161249	161249	them	3837	” inquired one of the magistrates . “
161315	161316	161249	161249	them	3837	” “
161325	161326	161327	161327	He	423	” “
161337	161342	161327	161327	He	423	” replied the jailer . “
161361	161362	161352	161352	I	0	” “
161372	161384	161385	161385	Wery	3846	” cried the Artful , making a note of the statement . “
161400	161413	161365	161365	you	3842	” Here there was another laugh , and another cry of silence . “
161422	161427	161419	161420	the witnesses	7934	” said the clerk . “
161434	161439	161419	161420	the witnesses	7934	” added the Dodger . “
161451	161636	161449	161449	’em	3848	” This wish was immediately gratified , for a policeman stepped forward who had seen the prisoner attempt the pocket of an unknown gentleman in a crowd , and indeed take a handkerchief therefrom , which , being a very old one , he deliberately put back again , after trying it on his own countenance . For this reason , he took the Dodger into custody as soon as he could get near him , and the said Dodger , being searched , had upon his person a silver snuff - box , with the owner ’s name engraved upon the lid . This gentleman had been discovered on reference to the Court Guide , and being then and there present , swore that the snuff - box was his , and that he had missed it on the previous day , the moment he had disengaged himself from the crowd before referred to . He had also remarked a young gentleman in the throng , particularly active in making his way about , and that young gentleman was the prisoner before him . “
161647	161652	161645	161645	boy	4595	” said the magistrate . “
161667	161672	161653	161653	I	0	” replied the Dodger . “
161681	161682	161674	161674	you	3849	” “
161696	161709	161710	161710	I	0	” inquired the jailer , nudging the silent Dodger with his elbow . “
161715	161728	161710	161710	I	0	” said the Dodger , looking up with an air of abstraction . “
161739	161740	161730	161730	you	3849	” “
161757	161765	161754	161755	your worship	4659	” observed the officer with a grin . “
161777	161778	161767	161767	you	3849	” “
161781	161786	161754	161755	your worship	4659	” replied the Dodger , “
161893	161894	161890	161890	I	0	” “
161902	161907	161897	161897	He	3859	” interposed the clerk . “
161912	161913	161897	161897	He	3859	” “
161917	161922	161897	161897	He	3859	” said the jailer . “
161931	161946	161926	161926	I	0	” replied the Dodger , brushing his hat with the palm of his hand . “
162029	162698	161992	161992	you	3864	” With these last words , the Dodger suffered himself to be led off by the collar ; threatening , till he got into the yard , to make a parliamentary business of it ; and then grinning in the officer ’s face , with great glee and self - approval . Having seen him locked up by himself in a little cell , Noah made the best of his way back to where he had left Master Bates . After waiting here some time , he was joined by that young gentleman , who had prudently abstained from showing himself until he had looked carefully abroad from a snug retreat , and ascertained that his new friend had not been followed by any impertinent person . The two hastened back together , to bear to Mr. Fagin the animating news that the Dodger was doing full justice to his bringing - up , and establishing for himself a glorious reputation .

Adept as she was , in all the arts of cunning and dissimulation , the girl Nancy could not wholly conceal the effect which the knowledge of the step she had taken , wrought upon her mind . She remembered that both the crafty Jew and the brutal Sikes had confided to her schemes , which had been hidden from all others : in the full confidence that she was trustworthy and beyond the reach of their suspicion . Vile as those schemes were , desperate as were their originators , and bitter as were her feelings towards Fagin , who had led her , step by step , deeper and deeper down into an abyss of crime and misery , whence was no escape ; still , there were times when , even towards him , she felt some relenting , lest her disclosure should bring him within the iron grasp he had so long eluded , and he should fall at last — richly as he merited such a fate — by her hand . But , these were the mere wanderings of a mind unable wholly to detach itself from old companions and associations , though enabled to fix itself steadily on one object , and resolved not to be turned aside by any consideration . Her fears for Sikes would have been more powerful inducements to recoil while there was yet time ; but she had stipulated that her secret should be rigidly kept , she had dropped no clue which could lead to his discovery , she had refused , even for his sake , a refuge from all the guilt and wretchedness that encompasses her — and what more could she do ! She was resolved . Though all her mental struggles terminated in this conclusion , they forced themselves upon her , again and again , and left their traces too . She grew pale and thin , even within a few days . At times , she took no heed of what was passing before her , or no part in conversations where once , she would have been the loudest . At other times , she laughed without merriment , and was noisy without a moment afterwards — she sat silent and dejected , brooding with her head upon her hands , while the very effort by which she roused herself , told , more forcibly than even these indications , that she was ill at ease , and that her thoughts were occupied with matters very different and distant from those in the course of discussion by her companions . It was Sunday night , and the bell of the nearest church struck the hour . Sikes and the Jew were talking , but they paused to listen . The girl looked up from the low seat on which she crouched , and listened too . Eleven . “
162706	162722	161992	161992	you	3864	” said Sikes , raising the blind to look out and returning to his seat . “
162737	162738	162767	162767	You	149	” “
162741	162745	162767	162767	You	149	” replied Fagin . “
162765	162766	162750	162750	Bill	149	” “
162773	162778	162767	162767	You	149	” replied Sikes gruffly . “
162792	162802	162785	162785	I	0	” Fagin sighed , and shook his head despondingly . “
162826	162830	162823	162823	I	0	” said Sikes . “
162841	162853	162838	162839	my dear	4649	” replied Fagin , venturing to pat him on the shoulder . “
162862	162863	162838	162839	my dear	4649	” “
162871	162875	162838	162839	my dear	4649	” cried Sikes . “
162882	162883	162838	162839	my dear	4649	” “
162890	162904	162838	162839	my dear	4649	” laughed Fagin , as if he were relieved by even this concession . “
162917	162918	162915	162915	yourself	149	” “
162941	162952	162915	162915	yourself	149	” said Sikes , casting off the Jew ’s hand . “
162967	162977	162915	162915	yourself	149	” said Fagin , determined not to be offended . “
162987	162991	162915	162915	yourself	149	” returned Sikes . “
163053	163097	163044	163044	I	0	” Fagin offered no reply to this compliment : but , pulling Sikes by the sleeve , pointed his finger towards Nancy , who had taken advantage of the foregoing conversation to put on her bonnet , and was now leaving the room . “
163100	163104	163105	163105	Nance	167	” cried Sikes . “
163119	163120	163109	163110	the gal	3875	” “
163124	163125	163109	163110	the gal	3875	” “
163131	163135	163139	163139	me	0	” retorted Sikes . “
163141	163142	163139	163139	me	0	” “
163149	163154	163143	163143	I	0	” replied the girl . “
163159	163184	163156	163156	I	0	” said Sikes , more in the spirit of obstinacy than because he had any real objection to the girl going where she listed . “
163190	163191	163192	163192	I	0	” “
163203	163208	163197	163197	I	0	” rejoined the girl . “
163216	163217	163209	163209	I	0	” “
163226	163230	163219	163219	your	0	” replied Sikes . “
163237	163242	163243	163243	I	0	” said the girl . “
163250	163251	163243	163243	I	0	” “
163259	163297	163253	163253	you	0	” replied Sikes . With which assurance he rose , locked the door , took the key out , and pulling her bonnet from her head , flung it up to the top of an old press . “
163300	163305	163253	163253	you	0	” said the robber . “
163316	163317	163314	163314	you	0	” “
163331	163339	163314	163314	you	0	” said the girl turning very pale . “
163355	163356	163348	163348	you	0	” “
163363	163371	163372	163372	she	3877	” cried Sikes , turning to Fagin , “
163393	163394	163383	163383	she	3877	” “
163404	163426	163395	163395	You	0	” muttered the girl placing both hands upon her breast , as though to keep down by force some violent outbreak . “
163438	163439	163395	163395	You	0	” “
163442	163446	163395	163395	You	0	” said Sikes . “
163472	163482	163468	163468	you	0	” cried Nancy stamping her foot upon the ground . “
163486	163498	163484	163484	you	0	” repeated Sikes turning round in his chair to confront her . “
163544	163545	163547	163547	me	0	” “
163550	163573	163547	163547	me	0	” said the girl with great earnestness ; then sitting herself down on the floor , before the door , she said , “
163604	163605	163589	163589	You	149	” “
163614	163625	163589	163589	You	149	” cried Sikes , seizing her roughly by the arm , “
163641	163642	163645	163645	you	149	” “
163661	163780	163652	163652	you	149	” screamed the girl . Sikes looked on , for a minute , watching his opportunity , and suddenly pinioning her hands dragged her , struggling and wrestling with him by the way , into a small room adjoining , where he sat himself on a bench , and thrusting her into a chair , held her down by force . She struggled and implored by turns until twelve o’clock had struck , and then , wearied and exhausted , ceased to contest the point any further . With a caution , backed by many oaths , to make no more efforts to go out that night , Sikes left her to recover at leisure and rejoined Fagin . “
163783	163794	163652	163652	you	149	” said the housebreaker wiping the perspiration from his face . “
163803	163804	163805	163805	You	149	” “
163812	163817	163818	163818	You	149	” replied Fagin thoughtfully . “
163823	163824	163818	163818	You	149	” “
163843	163847	163827	163827	she	3881	” asked Sikes . “
163863	163864	163867	163867	woman	3128	” “
163877	163878	163871	163871	I	0	” “
163886	163890	163871	163871	I	0	” growled Sikes . “
163906	163907	163899	163899	she	3881	” “
163910	163915	163899	163899	she	3881	” said Fagin thoughtfully . “
163929	163930	163932	163932	I	0	” “
163934	163938	163932	163932	I	0	” said Sikes . “
163963	163964	163941	163941	she	3881	” “
163968	163969	163941	163941	she	3881	” “
163991	164006	163984	163984	she	3881	” said Sikes . Fagin nodded an expressive approval of this mode of treatment . “
164042	164046	164028	164028	you	0	” said Sikes . “
164087	164088	164082	164082	her	3881	” “
164096	164104	164082	164082	her	3881	” replied the Jew in a whisper . “
164107	164153	164157	164157	she	3881	” As he uttered these words , the girl herself appeared and resumed her former seat . Her eyes were swollen and red ; she rocked herself to and fro ; tossed her head ; and , after a little time , burst out laughing . “
164164	164253	164157	164157	she	3881	” exclaimed Sikes , turning a look of excessive surprise on his companion . Fagin nodded to him to take no further notice just then ; and , in a few minutes , the girl subsided into her accustomed demeanour . Whispering Sikes that there was no fear of her relapsing , Fagin took up his hat and bade him good - night . He paused when he reached the room - door , and looking round , asked if somebody would light him down the dark stairs . “
164258	164268	164157	164157	she	3881	” said Sikes , who was filling his pipe . “
164292	164331	164344	164344	you	3891	” Nancy followed the old man downstairs , with a candle . When they reached the passage , he laid his finger on his lip , and drawing close to the girl , said , in a whisper . “
164340	164341	164336	164336	Nancy	167	” “
164347	164357	164344	164344	you	3891	” replied the girl , in the same tone . “
164364	164368	164344	164344	you	3891	” replied Fagin . “
164371	164381	164387	164387	he	3881	he_”—he pointed with his skinny fore - finger up the stairs—“is
164405	164406	164403	164403	you	3891	” “
164409	164433	164403	164403	you	3891	” said the girl , as Fagin paused , with his mouth almost touching her ear , and his eyes looking into hers . “
164527	164528	164525	164525	Nance	167	” “
164534	164545	164525	164525	Nance	167	” replied the girl , without manifesting the least emotion . “
164550	164849	164525	164525	Nance	167	” She shrank back , as Fagin offered to lay his hand on hers , but said good - night again , in a steady voice , and , answering his parting look with a nod of intelligence , closed the door between them . Fagin walked towards his home , intent upon the thoughts that were working within his brain . He had conceived the idea — not from what had just passed though that had tended to confirm him , but slowly and by degrees — that Nancy , wearied of the housebreaker ’s brutality , had conceived an attachment for some new friend . Her altered manner , her repeated absences from home alone , her comparative indifference to the interests of the gang for which she had once been so zealous , and , added to these , her desperate impatience to leave home that night at a particular hour , all favoured the supposition , and rendered it , to him at least , almost matter of certainty . The object of this new liking was not among his myrmidons . He would be a valuable acquisition with such an assistant as Nancy , and must ( thus Fagin argued ) be secured without delay . There was another , and a darker object , to be gained . Sikes knew too much , and his ruffian taunts had not galled Fagin the less , because the wounds were hidden . The girl must know , well , that if she shook him off , she could never be safe from his fury , and that it would be surely wreaked — to the maiming of limbs , or perhaps the loss of life — on the object of her more recent fancy . “
164855	164859	164525	164525	Nance	167	” thought Fagin , “
164928	165042	164910	164910	my	0	” These things passed through the mind of Fagin , during the short time he sat alone , in the housebreaker ’s room ; and with them uppermost in his thoughts , he had taken the opportunity afterwards afforded him , of sounding the girl in the broken hints he threw out at parting . There was no expression of surprise , no assumption of an inability to understand his meaning . The girl clearly comprehended it . Her glance at parting showed _ that _ . But perhaps she would recoil from a plot to take the life of Sikes , and that was one of the chief ends to be attained . “
165045	165054	164910	164910	my	0	” thought Fagin , as he crept homeward , “
165070	165133	165134	165134	I	0	” Such brains are fertile in expedients . If , without extracting a confession from herself , he laid a watch , discovered the object of her altered regard , and threatened to reveal the whole history to Sikes ( of whom she stood in no common fear ) unless she entered into his designs , could he not secure her compliance ? “
165137	165144	165134	165134	I	0	” said Fagin , almost aloud . “
165185	165310	165311	165311	Bolter	271	” He cast back a dark look , and a threatening motion of the hand , towards the spot where he had left the bolder villain ; and went on his way : busying his bony hands in the folds of his tattered garment , which he wrenched tightly in his grasp , as though there were a hated enemy crushed with every motion of his fingers . CHAPTER XLV . NOAH CLAYPOLE IS EMPLOYED BY FAGIN ON A SECRET MISSION The old man was up , betimes , next morning , and waited impatiently for the appearance of his new associate , who after a delay that seemed interminable , at length presented himself , and commenced a voracious assault on the breakfast . “
165313	165328	165311	165311	Bolter	271	” said Fagin , drawing up a chair and seating himself opposite Morris Bolter . “
165335	165339	165332	165332	I	0	” returned Noah . “
165377	165378	165368	165368	Yer	3905	” “
165390	165409	165388	165388	you	3905	” said Fagin , cursing his dear young friend ’s greediness from the very bottom of his heart . “
165425	165436	165422	165422	I	0	” said Noah , cutting a monstrous slice of bread . “
165441	165442	165439	165439	Charlotte	144	” “
165445	165449	165439	165439	Charlotte	144	” said Fagin . “
165470	165471	165463	165463	I	0	” “
165474	165478	165463	165463	I	0	” said Noah . “
165502	165533	165496	165496	Yer	3909	” There seemed , indeed , no great fear of anything interrupting him , as he had evidently sat down with a determination to do a great deal of business . “
165542	165546	165534	165534	You	3909	” said Fagin . “
165570	165571	165560	165562	The kinchin lay	3735	” “
165588	165593	165574	165574	you	3909	” said Mr. Bolter . “
165621	165622	165630	165631	a beginner	3913	” “
165633	165639	165626	165626	I	0	” remarked Mr. Bolter complacently . “
165688	165729	165730	165730	I	0	” Fagin affected to laugh very heartily ; and Mr. Bolter having had his laugh out , took a series of large bites , which finished his first hunk of bread and butter , and assisted himself to a second . “
165736	165745	165732	165732	you	0	” said Fagin , leaning over the table , “
165765	165766	165767	165767	I	0	” “
165770	165774	165767	165767	I	0	” rejoined Bolter , “
165812	165813	165808	165808	I	0	” “
165828	165833	165808	165808	I	0	” said the Jew ; “
165842	165843	165844	165846	An old woman	433	” “
165848	165853	165854	165856	A young one	3919	” demanded Mr. Bolter . “
165858	165862	165854	165856	A young one	3919	” replied Fagin . “
165873	165877	165870	165870	I	0	” said Bolter . “
165901	165902	165895	165895	her	4784	” “
165961	165962	165965	165965	yer	0	” “
165969	165989	165965	165965	yer	0	” asked Noah , setting down his cup , and looking his employer , eagerly , in the face . “
166005	166021	165965	165965	yer	0	” said Fagin , wishing to interest him in the scent as much as possible . “
166046	166047	166026	166026	I	0	” “
166052	166056	166057	166059	One of us	2255	” inquired Noah . “
166061	166062	166057	166059	One of us	2255	” “
166066	166075	166064	166064	Lor	125	” cried Noah , curling up his nose . “
166084	166085	166076	166076	Yer	0	” “
166105	166109	166110	166110	I	0	” replied Fagin . “
166113	166117	166110	166110	I	0	” said Noah . “
166146	166147	166141	166141	I	0	” “
166154	166166	166150	166150	you	0	” cried Fagin , elated by the success of his proposal . “
166173	166177	166150	166150	you	0	” replied Noah . “
166196	166197	166192	166192	I	0	” “
166220	166224	166210	166210	I	0	” said Fagin . “
166236	166323	166324	166324	She	4784	” That night , and the next , and the next again , the spy sat booted and equipped in his carter ’s dress : ready to turn out at a word from Fagin . Six nights passed — six long weary nights — and on each , Fagin came home with a disappointed face , and briefly intimated that it was not yet time . On the seventh , he returned earlier , and with an exultation he could not conceal . It was Sunday . “
166329	166333	166324	166324	She	4784	” said Fagin , “
166373	166529	166532	166533	the woman	6103	” Noah started up without saying a word ; for the Jew was in a state of such intense excitement that it infected him . They left the house stealthily , and hurrying through a labyrinth of streets , arrived at length before a public - house , which Noah recognised as the same in which he had slept , on the night of his arrival in London . It was past eleven o’clock , and the door was closed . It opened softly on its hinges as Fagin gave a low whistle . They entered , without noise ; and the door was closed behind them . Scarcely venturing to whisper , but substituting dumb show for words , Fagin , and the young Jew who had admitted them , pointed out the pane of glass to Noah , and signed to him to climb up and observe the person in the adjoining room . “
166535	166548	166532	166533	the woman	6103	” he asked , scarcely above his breath . Fagin nodded yes . “
166557	166561	166562	166562	She	6103	” whispered Noah . “
166574	166575	166562	166562	She	6103	” “
166579	166632	166633	166633	I	0	” whispered Fagin . He signed to Barney , who withdrew . In an instant , the lad entered the room adjoining , and , under pretence of snuffing the candle , moved it in the required position , and , speaking to the girl , caused her to raise her face . “
166638	166643	166635	166635	her	6103	” cried the spy . “
166646	166647	166635	166635	her	6103	” “
166656	166715	166651	166651	her	6103	” He hastily descended , as the room - door opened , and the girl came out . Fagin drew him behind a small partition which was curtained off , and they held their breaths as she passed within a few feet of their place of concealment , and emerged by the door at which they had entered . “
166718	166727	166728	166728	Dow	276	” cried the lad who held the door . “
166730	166742	166728	166728	Dow	276	” Noah exchanged a look with Fagin , and darted out . “
166747	166752	166728	166728	Dow	276	” whispered the lad ; “
166765	167616	166728	166728	Dow	276	” He did so ; and , by the light of the lamps , saw the girl ’s retreating figure , already at some distance before him . He advanced as near as he considered prudent , and kept on the opposite side of the street , the better to observe her motions . She looked nervously round , twice or thrice , and once stopped to let two men who were following close behind her , pass on . She seemed to gather courage as she advanced , and to walk with a steadier and firmer step . The spy preserved the same relative distance between them , and followed : with his eye upon her . CHAPTER XLVI . THE APPOINTMENT KEPT The church clocks chimed three quarters past eleven , as two figures emerged on London Bridge . One , which advanced with a swift and rapid step , was that of a woman who looked eagerly about her as though in quest of some expected object ; the other figure was that of a man , who slunk along in the deepest shadow he could find , and , at some distance , accommodated his pace to hers : stopping when she stopped : and as she moved again , creeping stealthily on : but never allowing himself , in the ardour of his pursuit , to gain upon her footsteps . Thus , they crossed the bridge , from the Middlesex to the Surrey shore , when the woman , apparently disappointed in her anxious scrutiny of the foot - passengers , turned back . The movement was sudden ; but he who watched her , was not thrown off his guard by it ; for , shrinking into one of the recesses which surmount the piers of the bridge , and leaning over the parapet the better to conceal his figure , he suffered her to pass on the opposite pavement . When she was about the same distance in advance as she had been before , he slipped quietly down , and followed her again . At nearly the centre of the bridge , she stopped . The man stopped too . It was a very dark night . The day had been unfavourable , and at that hour and place there were few people stirring . Such as there were , hurried quickly past : very possibly without seeing , but certainly without noticing , either the woman , or the man who kept her in view . Their appearance was not calculated to attract the importunate regards of such of London ’s destitute population , as chanced to take their way over the bridge that night in search of some cold arch or doorless hovel wherein to lay their heads ; they stood there in silence : neither speaking nor spoken to , by any one who passed . A mist hung over the river , deepening the red glare of the fires that burnt upon the small craft moored off the different wharfs , and rendering darker and more indistinct the murky buildings on the banks . The old smoke - stained storehouses on either side , rose heavy and dull from the dense mass of roofs and gables , and frowned sternly upon water too black to reflect even their lumbering shapes . The tower of old Saint Saviour ’s Church , and the spire of Saint Magnus , so long the giant - warders of the ancient bridge , were visible in the gloom ; but the forest of shipping below bridge , and the thickly scattered spires of churches above , were nearly all hidden from sight . The girl had taken a few restless turns to and fro — closely watched meanwhile by her hidden observer — when the heavy bell of St. Paul ’s tolled for the death of another day . Midnight had come upon the crowded city . The palace , the night - cellar , the jail , the madhouse : the chambers of birth and death , of health and sickness , the rigid face of the corpse and the calm sleep of the child : midnight was upon them all . The hour had not struck two minutes , when a young lady , accompanied by a grey - haired gentleman , alighted from a hackney - carriage within a short distance of the bridge , and , having dismissed the vehicle , walked straight towards it . They had scarcely set foot upon its pavement , when the girl started , and immediately made towards them . They walked onward , looking about them with the air of persons who entertained some very slight expectation which had little chance of being realised , when they were suddenly joined by this new associate . They halted with an exclamation of surprise , but suppressed it immediately ; for a man in the garments of a countryman came close up — brushed against them , indeed — at that precise moment . “
167620	167625	167626	167626	I	0	” said Nancy hurriedly , “
167649	168054	168102	168102	you	1668	” As she uttered these words , and indicated , with her hand , the direction in which she wished them to proceed , the countryman looked round , and roughly asking what they took up the whole pavement for , passed on . The steps to which the girl had pointed , were those which , on the Surrey bank , and on the same side of the bridge as Saint Saviour ’s Church , form a landing - stairs from the river . To this spot , the man bearing the appearance of a countryman , hastened unobserved ; and after a moment ’s survey of the place , he began to descend . These stairs are a part of the bridge ; they consist of three flights . Just below the end of the second , going down , the stone wall on the left terminates in an ornamental pilaster facing towards the Thames . At this point the lower steps widen : so that a person turning that angle of the wall , is necessarily unseen by any others on the stairs who chance to be above him , if only a step . The countryman looked hastily round , when he reached this point ; and as there seemed no better place of concealment , and , the tide being out , there was plenty of room , he slipped aside , with his back to the pilaster , and there waited : pretty certain that they would come no lower , and that even if he could not hear what was said , he could follow them again , with safety . So tardily stole the time in this lonely place , and so eager was the spy to penetrate the motives of an interview so different from what he had been led to expect , that he more than once gave the matter up for lost , and persuaded himself , either that they had stopped far above , or had resorted to some entirely different spot to hold their mysterious conversation . He was on the point of emerging from his hiding - place , and regaining the road above , when he heard the sound of footsteps , and directly afterwards of voices almost close at his ear . He drew himself straight upright against the wall , and , scarcely breathing , listened attentively . “
168060	168073	168074	168074	I	0	” said a voice , which was evidently that of the gentleman . “
168111	168112	168104	168104	I	0	” “
168117	168129	168104	168104	I	0	” cried the voice of the girl whom he had followed . “
168151	168152	168104	168104	I	0	” “
168158	168167	168104	168104	I	0	” said the gentleman in a kinder tone , “
168215	168216	168217	168217	I	0	” “
168222	168226	168217	168217	I	0	” replied Nancy , “
168245	168252	168237	168237	I	0	” said the girl , shuddering , “
168270	168271	168265	168265	I	0	” “
168277	168288	168289	168289	I	0	” asked the gentleman , who seemed to pity her . “
168295	168300	168289	168289	I	0	” replied the girl . “
168362	168363	168340	168340	I	0	” “
168366	168374	168340	168340	I	0	” said the gentleman , soothing her . “
168378	168387	168340	168340	I	0	” replied the girl in a hoarse voice . “
168421	168422	168409	168409	they	3945	” “
168430	168435	168436	168436	They	3945	” said the gentleman . “
168442	168443	168436	168436	They	3945	” “
168449	168454	168436	168436	They	3945	” rejoined the girl . “
168459	168531	168436	168436	They	3945	” There was something so uncommon in her manner , that the flesh of the concealed listener crept as he heard the girl utter these words , and the blood chilled within him . He had never experienced a greater relief than in hearing the sweet voice of the young lady as she begged her to be calm , and not allow herself to become the prey of such fearful fancies . “
168537	168546	168547	168548	Poor creature	3949	” said the young lady to her companion . “
168556	168557	168558	168558	Your	0	” “
168583	168588	168565	168565	their	3950	” cried the girl . “
168643	168644	168674	168676	these good people	931	” “
168647	168652	168674	168676	these good people	931	” said the gentleman . “
168721	168759	168760	168760	You	3961	” These words appeared to be addressed to the young lady , and were perhaps uttered with the view of affording Nancy time to recover herself . The gentleman , shortly afterwards , addressed himself to her . “
168768	168772	168760	168760	You	3961	” he said . “
168778	168782	168773	168773	I	0	” replied Nancy ; “
168789	168790	168773	168773	I	0	” “
168794	168795	168796	168796	Him	3962	” “
168806	168807	168800	168804	the young lady of before	3963	” “
168831	168837	168828	168828	I	0	” asked the old gentleman . “
168840	168849	168828	168828	I	0	” replied the girl , shaking her head . “
168879	168880	168882	168882	he	3962	” “
168888	168893	168882	168882	he	3962	” inquired the gentleman . “
168906	168907	168898	168898	he	3962	” “
168910	168915	168898	168898	he	3962	” said the gentleman . “
168921	168922	168923	168923	I	0	” “
168927	168939	168923	168923	I	0	” replied the girl , as he paused for a moment . “
168944	168949	168940	168942	This young lady	1674	” the gentleman began , “
169004	169005	169006	169006	I	0	” “
169009	169015	169006	169006	I	0	” said the girl earnestly . “
169068	169073	169074	169074	he	3971	” said the gentleman , “
169101	169102	169103	169103	Fagin	161	” “
169105	169112	169103	169103	Fagin	161	” cried the girl , recoiling . “
169122	169127	169120	169120	you	0	” said the gentleman . “
169140	169145	169134	169134	I	0	” replied the girl . “
169168	169169	169170	169170	You	0	” “
169174	169187	169170	169170	You	0	” said the gentleman , who seemed fully prepared for this answer . “
169190	169195	169170	169170	You	0	” returned the girl . “
169200	169201	169170	169170	You	0	” “
169206	169212	169230	169230	she	711	” rejoined the girl firmly , “
169306	169307	169303	169303	they	3976	” “
169310	169331	169303	169303	they	3976	” said the gentleman , quickly , as if this had been the point he had been aiming to attain ; “
169347	169348	169303	169303	they	3976	” “
169357	169358	169359	169359	I	0	” “
169416	169417	169410	169410	they	3978	” “
169424	169429	169410	169410	they	3978	” suggested the girl . “
169432	169437	169410	169410	they	3978	” pursued the gentleman , “
169471	169472	169474	169474	I	0	” “
169482	169487	169488	169488	You	0	” asked the girl . “
169491	169495	169496	169496	My	0	” replied Rose . “
169502	169503	169504	169504	Monks	226	” “
169515	169525	169504	169504	Monks	226	” said the girl , after a short pause . “
169528	169533	169504	169504	Monks	226	” replied the gentleman . “
169551	169552	169553	169553	I	0	” “
169567	169577	169556	169557	a liar	5409	” said the girl after another interval of silence , “
169585	169735	169736	169736	He	3983	” After receiving an assurance from both , that she might safely do so , she proceeded in a voice so low that it was often difficult for the listener to discover even the purport of what she said , to describe , by name and situation , the public - house whence she had been followed that night . From the manner in which she occasionally paused , it appeared as if the gentleman were making some hasty notes of the information she communicated . When she had thoroughly explained the localities of the place , the best position from which to watch it without exciting observation , and the night and hour on which Monks was most in the habit of frequenting it , she seemed to consider for a few moments , for the purpose of recalling his features and appearances more forcibly to her recollection . “
169740	169745	169736	169736	He	3983	” said the girl , “
169882	169915	169879	169879	you	3986	” said the girl , stopping suddenly . The gentleman replied , in a hurried manner , that he was not conscious of having done so , and begged her to proceed . “
169920	169925	169879	169879	you	3986	” said the girl , “
169978	169982	169984	169984	his	3983	” she added . “
170009	170010	170003	170003	his	3983	” “
170022	170027	170003	170003	his	3983	” cried the gentleman . “
170032	170037	170038	170038	You	3986	” said the girl . “
170042	170070	170038	170038	You	3986	” The young lady uttered a cry of surprise , and for a few moments they were so still that the listener could distinctly hear them breathe . “
170076	170084	170073	170073	I	0	” said the gentleman , breaking silence . “
170110	170149	170153	170153	he	3983	” As he expressed himself to this effect , with assumed carelessness , he took a step or two nearer the concealed spy , as the latter could tell from the distinctness with which he heard him mutter , “
170155	170156	170153	170153	he	3983	” “
170159	170181	170182	170182	you	3986	” he said , returning : so it seemed by the sound : to the spot where he had stood before , “
170212	170213	170206	170206	I	0	” “
170216	170220	170221	170221	You	3986	” replied Nancy . “
170229	170253	170221	170221	You	3986	” rejoined the gentleman , with a voice and emphasis of kindness that might have touched a much harder and more obdurate heart . “
170260	170261	170258	170258	me	0	” “
170266	170273	170264	170264	sir	4543	” rejoined the girl , weeping . “
170290	170291	170292	170292	You	3986	” “
170299	170304	170294	170294	yourself	3986	” said the gentleman . “
170527	170528	170529	170529	She	4004	” “
170535	170541	170542	170542	She	4004	” cried the young lady . “
170549	170550	170542	170542	She	4004	” “
170558	170563	170551	170551	I	0	” said the gentleman . “
170571	170581	170567	170567	I	0	” replied the girl , after a short struggle . “
170641	170649	170621	170621	you	0	” she said , looking hastily round , “
170662	170663	170657	170657	I	0	” “
170666	170679	170657	170657	I	0	” repeated the young lady , with great stress upon the word . “
170684	170689	170657	170657	I	0	” rejoined the girl . “
170748	170749	170736	170736	you	3450	” “
170754	170763	170736	170736	you	3450	” said the gentleman , with a sigh . “
170786	170787	170775	170775	We	4010	” “
170792	170797	170798	170798	You	3450	” urged the girl . “
170801	170802	170798	170798	You	3450	” “
170805	170811	170798	170798	You	3450	” cried the young lady , “
170823	170824	170798	170798	You	3450	” “
170827	170832	170798	170798	You	3450	” repeated the girl . “
170897	170898	170889	170889	I	0	” “
170906	170914	170889	170889	I	0	” returned the young lady , sobbing . “
170932	170937	170889	170889	I	0	” replied the girl . “
170946	170952	170889	170889	I	0	” The gentleman turned away . “
170956	170962	170889	170889	I	0	” cried the young lady . “
170983	170984	170889	170889	I	0	” “
170987	170992	170889	170889	I	0	” replied the girl . “
171072	171148	171168	171168	her	4018	” The violent agitation of the girl , and the apprehension of some discovery which would subject her to ill - usage and violence , seemed to determine the gentleman to leave her , as she requested . The sound of retreating footsteps were audible and the voices ceased . The two figures of the young lady and her companion soon afterwards appeared upon the bridge . They stopped at the summit of the stairs . “
171151	171159	171161	171161	she	4018	” cried the young lady , listening . “
171171	171172	171168	171168	her	4018	” “
171178	171187	171168	171168	her	4018	” replied Mr. Brownlow , looking sadly back . “
171201	171786	171188	171188	She	4018	” Rose Maylie lingered , but the old gentleman drew her arm through his , and led her , with gentle force , away . As they disappeared , the girl sunk down nearly at her full length upon one of the stone stairs , and vented the anguish of her heart in bitter tears . After a time she arose , and with feeble and tottering steps ascended the street . The astonished listener remained motionless on his post for some minutes afterwards , and having ascertained , with many cautious glances round him , that he was again alone , crept slowly from his hiding - place , and returned , stealthily and in the shade of the wall , in the same manner as he had descended . Peeping out , more than once , when he reached the top , to make sure that he was unobserved , Noah Claypole darted away at his utmost speed , and made for the Jew ’s house as fast as his legs would carry him . CHAPTER XLVII . FATAL CONSEQUENCES It was nearly two hours before day - break ; that time which in the autumn of the year , may be truly called the dead of night ; when the streets are silent and deserted ; when even sounds appear to slumber , and profligacy and riot have staggered home to dream ; it was at this still and silent hour , that Fagin sat watching in his old lair , with face so distorted and pale , and eyes so red and blood - shot , that he looked less like a man , than like some hideous phantom , moist from the grave , and worried by an evil spirit . He sat crouching over a cold hearth , wrapped in an old torn coverlet , with his face turned towards a wasting candle that stood upon a table by his side . His right hand was raised to his lips , and as , absorbed in thought , he bit his long black nails , he disclosed among his toothless gums a few such fangs as should have been a dog ’s or rat ’s . Stretched upon a mattress on the floor , lay Noah Claypole , fast asleep . Towards him the old man sometimes directed his eyes for an instant , and then brought them back again to the candle ; which with a long - burnt wick drooping almost double , and hot grease falling down in clots upon the table , plainly showed that his thoughts were busy elsewhere . Indeed they were . Mortification at the overthrow of his notable scheme ; hatred of the girl who had dared to palter with strangers ; and utter distrust of the sincerity of her refusal to yield him up ; bitter disappointment at the loss of his revenge on Sikes ; the fear of detection , and ruin , and death ; and a fierce and deadly rage kindled by all ; these were the passionate considerations which , following close upon each other with rapid and ceaseless whirl , shot through the brain of Fagin , as every evil thought and blackest purpose lay working at his heart . He sat without changing his attitude in the least , or appearing to take the smallest heed of time , until his quick ear seemed to be attracted by a footstep in the street . “
171790	171801	171188	171188	She	4018	” he muttered , wiping his dry and fevered mouth . “
171805	171859	171188	171188	She	4018	” The bell rang gently as he spoke . He crept upstairs to the door , and presently returned accompanied by a man muffled to the chin , who carried a bundle under one arm . Sitting down and throwing back his outer coat , the man displayed the burly frame of Sikes . “
171862	171873	171883	171883	you	4021	” he said , laying the bundle on the table . “
171908	172008	171898	171898	I	0	” Fagin laid his hand upon the bundle , and locking it in the cupboard , sat down again without speaking . But he did not take his eyes off the robber , for an instant , during this action ; and now that they sat over against each other , face to face , he looked fixedly at him , with his lips quivering so violently , and his face so altered by the emotions which had mastered him , that the housebreaker involuntarily drew back his chair , and surveyed him with a look of real affright . “
172012	172016	171898	171898	I	0	” cried Sikes . “
172027	172061	172019	172019	you	4021	” Fagin raised his right hand , and shook his trembling forefinger in the air ; but his passion was so great , that the power of speech was for the moment gone . “
172064	172078	172079	172079	He	4024	” said Sikes , feeling in his breast with a look of alarm . “
172091	172092	172084	172084	I	0	” “
172097	172105	172084	172084	I	0	” rejoined Fagin , finding his voice . “
172128	172129	172117	172117	I	0	” “
172140	172160	172138	172138	you	4021	” said Sikes , looking sternly at him , and ostentatiously passing a pistol into a more convenient pocket . “
172179	172180	172181	172181	I	0	” “
172191	172200	172181	172181	I	0	” said Fagin , drawing his chair nearer , “
172208	172209	172181	172181	I	0	” “
172212	172221	172181	172181	I	0	” returned the robber with an incredulous air . “
172236	172237	172229	172229	Nance	167	” “
172240	172244	172245	172245	She	167	” cried Fagin . “
172259	172297	172301	172301	you	149	” Sikes looked with an aspect of great perplexity into the Jew ’s face , and reading no satisfactory explanation of the riddle there , clenched his coat collar in his huge hand and shook him soundly . “
172303	172307	172301	172301	you	149	” he said ; “
172350	172351	172341	172341	you	149	” “
172360	172382	172353	172358	that lad that ’s laying there	4027	” Fagin began . Sikes turned round to where Noah was sleeping , as if he had not previously observed him . “
172385	172394	172353	172358	that lad that ’s laying there	4027	” he said , resuming his former position . “
172399	172403	172396	172397	that lad	4028	” pursued Fagin , “
172542	172553	172538	172538	you	4035	” cried the Jew , his eyes flashing with rage . “
172563	172564	172555	172555	he	4028	” “
172568	172577	172555	172555	he	4028	” replied Sikes ; with a tremendous oath . “
172611	172612	172587	172587	I	0	” “
172619	172627	172628	172628	I	0	” cried Fagin almost in a yell . “
172643	172644	172645	172645	I	0	” “
172650	172665	172645	172645	I	0	” replied Sikes , clenching his teeth and turning white at the mere suggestion . “
172718	172728	172712	172712	I	0	” muttered the robber , poising his brawny arm , “
172745	172746	172747	172747	You	0	” “
172750	172751	172747	172747	You	0	” “
172755	172760	172762	172762	me	0	” said the housebreaker . “
172764	172765	172762	172762	me	0	” “
172780	172781	172769	172769	Charley	164	” “
172788	172793	172782	172782	I	0	” replied Sikes impatiently . “
172805	172868	172869	172869	Bolter	271	” Fagin looked hard at the robber ; and , motioning him to be silent , stooped over the bed upon the floor , and shook the sleeper to rouse him . Sikes leant forward in his chair : looking on with his hands upon his knees , as if wondering much what all this questioning and preparation was to end in . “
172876	172897	172898	172898	He	271	” said Fagin , looking up with an expression of devilish anticipation , and speaking slowly and with marked emphasis . “
172916	172917	172914	172914	Bill	149	” “
172922	172975	172919	172919	d’ye	4044	” asked Sikes , drawing back . Fagin made no answer , but bending over the sleeper again , hauled him into a sitting posture . When his assumed name had been repeated several times , Noah rubbed his eyes , and , giving a heavy yawn , looked sleepily about him . “
172990	173002	172919	172919	d’ye	4044	” said the Jew , pointing to Sikes as he spoke . “
173007	173017	172919	172919	d’ye	4044	” asked the sleepy Noah , shaking himself pettishly . “
173025	173049	173022	173022	Nancy	167	” said Fagin , clutching Sikes by the wrist , as if to prevent his leaving the house before he had heard enough . “
173054	173055	173050	173050	You	0	” “
173058	173059	173052	173052	her	167	” “
173064	173065	173022	173022	Nancy	167	” “
173068	173069	173022	173022	Nancy	167	” “
173076	173077	173073	173074	two people	3339	” “
173082	173083	173079	173079	she	167	” “
173199	173208	173196	173196	she	167	” cried Fagin , half mad with fury . “
173212	173220	173196	173196	she	167	” replied Noah , scratching his head . “
173228	173229	173232	173232	they	4050	” “
173239	173240	173232	173232	they	4050	” “
173245	173251	173232	173232	they	4050	” replied Noah , considering . “
173259	173260	173253	173253	I	0	” “
173267	173292	173293	173293	They	4050	” cried Fagin , tightening his grasp on Sikes , and brandishing his other hand aloft , as the foam flew from his lips . “
173297	173319	173320	173320	they	4050	” said Noah , who , as he grew more wakeful , seemed to have a dawning perception who Sikes was , “
173342	173343	173336	173336	She	167	” “
173352	173353	173349	173349	him	4051	” “
173373	173377	173362	173362	Bill	149	” replied Noah . “
173383	173387	173381	173381	him	149	” cried Fagin . “
173408	173409	173381	173381	him	149	” “
173431	173435	173381	173381	him	149	” said Noah ; “
173477	173478	173469	173469	she	167	” “
173483	173493	173469	173469	she	167	” cried Sikes , breaking fiercely from the Jew . “
173498	173523	173524	173524	Bill	149	” Flinging the old man from him , he rushed from the room , and darted , wildly and furiously , up the stairs . “
173528	173536	173526	173526	Bill	149	” cried Fagin , following him hastily . “
173544	173581	173526	173526	Bill	149	” The word would not have been exchanged , but that the housebreaker was unable to open the door : on which he was expending fruitless oaths and violence , when the Jew came panting up . “
173586	173590	173526	173526	Bill	149	” said Sikes . “
173609	173610	173606	173606	I	0	” “
173617	173628	173612	173612	me	0	” rejoined Fagin , laying his hand upon the lock . “
173634	173635	173629	173629	You	0	” “
173638	173643	173629	173629	You	0	” replied the other . “
173655	173698	173653	173653	Bill	149	” The day was breaking , and there was light enough for the men to see each other ’s faces . They exchanged one brief glance ; there was a fire in the eyes of both , which could not be mistaken . “
173702	173716	173653	173653	Bill	149	” said Fagin , showing that he felt all disguise was now useless , “
173733	173919	173726	173726	Bill	149	” Sikes made no reply ; but , pulling open the door , of which Fagin had turned the lock , dashed into the silent streets . Without one pause , or moment ’s consideration ; without once turning his head to the right or left , or raising his eyes to the sky , or lowering them to the ground , but looking straight before him with savage resolution : his teeth so tightly compressed that the strained jaw seemed starting through his skin ; the robber held on his headlong course , nor muttered a word , nor relaxed a muscle , until he reached his own door . He opened it , softly , with a key ; strode lightly up the stairs ; and entering his own room , double - locked the door , and lifting a heavy table against it , drew back the curtain of the bed . The girl was lying , half - dressed , upon it . He had roused her from her sleep , for she raised herself with a hurried and startled look . “
173923	173928	173726	173726	Bill	149	” said the man . “
173935	173949	173931	173931	you	4056	” said the girl , with an expression of pleasure at his return . “
173953	173958	173931	173931	you	4056	” was the reply . “
173962	174003	173931	173931	you	4056	” There was a candle burning , but the man hastily drew it from the candlestick , and hurled it under the grate . Seeing the faint light of early day without , the girl rose to undraw the curtain . “
174008	174018	173931	173931	you	4056	” said Sikes , thrusting his hand before her . “
174031	174032	174033	174033	Bill	149	” “
174035	174047	174033	174033	Bill	149	” said the girl , in the low voice of alarm , “
174057	174111	174112	174112	Bill	149	” The robber sat regarding her , for a few seconds , with dilated nostrils and heaving breast ; and then , grasping her by the head and throat , dragged her into the middle of the room , and looking once towards the door , placed his heavy hand upon her mouth . “
174116	174127	174114	174114	Bill	149	” gasped the girl , wrestling with the strength of mortal fear,—“I
174153	174154	174155	174155	You	0	” “
174162	174171	174158	174158	you	0	” returned the robber , suppressing his breath . “
174184	174185	174158	174158	you	0	” “
174201	174210	174211	174211	Bill	149	” rejoined the girl , clinging to him . “
174311	174346	174347	174347	Bill	149	” The man struggled violently , to release his arms ; but those of the girl were clasped round his , and tear her as he would , he could not tear them away . “
174349	174363	174364	174365	the gentleman	4594	” cried the girl , striving to lay her head upon his breast , “
174480	176035	174458	174458	They	4061	” The housebreaker freed one arm , and grasped his pistol . The certainty of immediate detection if he fired , flashed across his mind even in the midst of his fury ; and he beat it twice with all the force he could summon , upon the upturned face that almost touched his own . She staggered and fell : nearly blinded with the blood that rained down from a deep gash in her forehead ; but raising herself , with difficulty , on her knees , drew from her bosom a white handkerchief — Rose Maylie ’s own — and holding it up , in her folded hands , as high towards Heaven as her feeble strength would allow , breathed one prayer for mercy to her Maker . It was a ghastly figure to look upon . The murderer staggering backward to the wall , and shutting out the sight with his hand , seized a heavy club and struck her down . CHAPTER XLVIII . THE FLIGHT OF SIKES Of all bad deeds that , under cover of the darkness , had been committed within wide London ’s bounds since night hung over it , that was the worst . Of all the horrors that rose with an ill scent upon the morning air , that was the foulest and most cruel . The sun — the bright sun , that brings back , not light alone , but new life , and hope , and freshness to man — burst upon the crowded city in clear and radiant glory . Through costly - coloured glass and paper - mended window , through cathedral dome and rotten crevice , it shed its equal ray . It lighted up the room where the murdered woman lay . It did . He tried to shut it out , but it would stream in . If the sight had been a ghastly one in the dull morning , what was it , now , in all that brilliant light ! He had not moved ; he had been afraid to stir . There had been a moan and motion of the hand ; and , with terror added to rage , he had struck and struck again . Once he threw a rug over it ; but it was worse to fancy the eyes , and imagine them moving towards him , than to see them glaring upward , as if watching the reflection of the pool of gore that quivered and danced in the sunlight on the ceiling . He had plucked it off again . And there was the body — mere flesh and blood , no more — but such flesh , and so much blood ! He struck a light , kindled a fire , and thrust the club into it . There was hair upon the end , which blazed and shrunk into a light cinder , and , caught by the air , whirled up the chimney . Even that frightened him , sturdy as he was ; but he held the weapon till it broke , and then piled it on the coals to burn away , and smoulder into ashes . He washed himself , and rubbed his clothes ; there were spots that would not be removed , but he cut the pieces out , and burnt them . How those stains were dispersed about the room ! The very feet of the dog were bloody . All this time he had , never once , turned his back upon the corpse ; no , not for a moment . Such preparations completed , he moved , backward , towards the door : dragging the dog with him , lest he should soil his feet anew and carry out new evidence of the crime into the streets . He shut the door softly , locked it , took the key , and left the house . He crossed over , and glanced up at the window , to be sure that nothing was visible from the outside . There was the curtain still drawn , which she would have opened to admit the light she never saw again . It lay nearly under there . _ He _ knew that . God , how the sun poured down upon the very spot ! The glance was instantaneous . It was a relief to have got free of the room . He whistled on the dog , and walked rapidly away . He went through Islington ; strode up the hill at Highgate on which stands the stone in honour of Whittington ; turned down to Highgate Hill , unsteady of purpose , and uncertain where to go ; struck off to the right again , almost as soon as he began to descend it ; and taking the foot - path across the fields , skirted Caen Wood , and so came on Hampstead Heath . Traversing the hollow by the Vale of Heath , he mounted the opposite bank , and crossing the road which joins the villages of Hampstead and Highgate , made along the remaining portion of the heath to the fields at North End , in one of which he laid himself down under a hedge , and slept . Soon he was up again , and away,—not far into the country , but back towards London by the high - road — then back again — then over another part of the same ground as he already traversed — then wandering up and down in fields , and lying on ditches ’ brinks to rest , and starting up to make for some other spot , and do the same , and ramble on again . Where could he go , that was near and not too public , to get some meat and drink ? Hendon . That was a good place , not far off , and out of most people ’s way . Thither he directed his steps,—running sometimes , and sometimes , with a strange perversity , loitering at a snail ’s pace , or stopping altogether and idly breaking the hedges with a stick . But when he got there , all the people he met — the very children at the doors — seemed to view him with suspicion . Back he turned again , without the courage to purchase bit or drop , though he had tasted no food for many hours ; and once more he lingered on the Heath , uncertain where to go . He wandered over miles and miles of ground , and still came back to the old place . Morning and noon had passed , and the day was on the wane , and still he rambled to and fro , and up and down , and round and round , and still lingered about the same spot . At last he got away , and shaped his course for Hatfield . It was nine o’clock at night , when the man , quite tired out , and the dog , limping and lame from the unaccustomed exercise , turned down the hill by the church of the quiet village , and plodding along the little street , crept into a small public - house , whose scanty light had guided them to the spot . There was a fire in the tap - room , and some country - labourers were drinking before it . They made room for the stranger , but he sat down in the furthest corner , and ate and drank alone , or rather with his dog : to whom he cast a morsel of food from time to time . The conversation of the men assembled here , turned upon the neighbouring land , and farmers ; and when those topics were exhausted , upon the age of some old man who had been buried on the previous Sunday ; the young men present considering him very old , and the old men present declaring him to have been quite young — not older , one white - haired grandfather said , than he was — with ten or fifteen year of life in him at least — if he had taken care ; if he had taken care . There was nothing to attract attention , or excite alarm in this . The robber , after paying his reckoning , sat silent and unnoticed in his corner , and had almost dropped asleep , when he was half wakened by the noisy entrance of a new comer . This was an antic fellow , half pedlar and half mountebank , who travelled about the country on foot to vend hones , strops , razors , washballs , harness - paste , medicine for dogs and horses , cheap perfumery , cosmetics , and such - like wares , which he carried in a case slung to his back . His entrance was the signal for various homely jokes with the countrymen , which slackened not until he had made his supper , and opened his box of treasures , when he ingeniously contrived to unite business with amusement . “
176048	176064	174458	174458	They	4061	” asked a grinning countryman , pointing to some composition - cakes in one corner . “
176067	176075	174458	174458	They	4061	” said the fellow , producing one , “
176269	176293	176338	176338	they	4069	” There were two buyers directly , and more of the listeners plainly hesitated . The vendor observing this , increased in loquacity . “
176307	176312	176338	176338	they	4069	” said the fellow . “
176473	176474	176457	176457	I	0	” “
176477	176483	176457	176457	I	0	” cried Sikes starting up . “
176488	176489	176490	176490	I	0	” “
176499	176509	176490	176490	I	0	” replied the man , winking to the company , “
176585	176769	176790	176790	you	4080	” The man got no further , for Sikes with a hideous imprecation overthrew the table , and tearing the hat from him , burst out of the house . With the same perversity of feeling and irresolution that had fastened upon him , despite himself , all day , the murderer , finding that he was not followed , and that they most probably considered him some drunken sullen fellow , turned back up the town , and getting out of the glare of the lamps of a stage - coach that was standing in the street , was walking past , when he recognised the mail from London , and saw that it was standing at the little post - office . He almost knew what was to come ; but he crossed over , and listened . The guard was standing at the door , waiting for the letter - bag . A man , dressed like a game - keeper , came up at the moment , and he handed him a basket which lay ready on the pavement . “
176776	176781	176790	176790	you	4080	” said the guard . “
176813	176814	176810	176810	you	4080	” “
176823	176845	176821	176821	Ben	278	” asked the game - keeper , drawing back to the window - shutters , the better to admire the horses . “
176854	176864	176865	176865	Corn	4084	” replied the man , pulling on his gloves . “
176893	176894	176885	176885	I	0	” “
176902	176916	176885	176885	I	0	” said a gentleman inside , who was looking out of the window . “
176924	176925	176929	176929	sir	4543	” “
176931	176940	176929	176929	sir	4543	” rejoined the guard , touching his hat . “
176949	176950	176951	176952	A woman	4784	” “
176954	176959	176951	176952	A woman	4784	” replied the gentleman . “
176964	176965	176951	176952	A woman	4784	” “
176970	176976	176968	176968	Ben	278	” replied the coachman impatiently . “
176983	176988	176968	176968	Ben	278	” said the guard ; “
176997	176998	176990	176990	you	278	” “
177001	177010	176990	176990	you	278	” cried the office keeper , running out . “
177013	177018	176990	176990	you	278	” growled the guard . “
177057	178404	178405	178405	He	4091	” The horn sounded a few cheerful notes , and the coach was gone . Sikes remained standing in the street , apparently unmoved by what he had just heard , and agitated by no stronger feeling than a doubt where to go . At length he went back again , and took the road which leads from Hatfield to St. Albans . He went on doggedly ; but as he left the town behind him , and plunged into the solitude and darkness of the road , he felt a dread and awe creeping upon him which shook him to the core . Every object before him , substance or shadow , still or moving , took the semblance of some fearful thing ; but these fears were nothing compared to the sense that haunted him of that morning ’s ghastly figure following at his heels . He could trace its shadow in the gloom , supply the smallest item of the outline , and note how stiff and solemn it seemed to stalk along . He could hear its garments rustling in the leaves , and every breath of wind came laden with that last low cry . If he stopped it did the same . If he ran , it followed — not running too : that would have been a relief : but like a corpse endowed with the mere machinery of life , and borne on one slow melancholy wind that never rose or fell . At times , he turned , with desperate determination , resolved to beat this phantom off , though it should look him dead ; but the hair rose on his head , and his blood stood still , for it had turned with him and was behind him then . He had kept it before him that morning , but it was behind now — always . He leaned his back against a bank , and felt that it stood above him , visibly out against the cold night - sky . He threw himself upon the road — on his back upon the road . At his head it stood , silent , erect , and still — a living grave - stone , with its epitaph in blood . Let no man talk of murderers escaping justice , and hint that Providence must sleep . There were twenty score of violent deaths in one long minute of that agony of fear . There was a shed in a field he passed , that offered shelter for the night . Before the door , were three tall poplar trees , which made it very dark within ; and the wind moaned through them with a dismal wail . He _ could not _ walk on , till daylight came again ; and here he stretched himself close to the wall — to undergo new torture . For now , a vision came before him , as constant and more terrible than that from which he had escaped . Those widely staring eyes , so lustreless and so glassy , that he had better borne to see them than think upon them , appeared in the midst of the darkness : light in themselves , but giving light to nothing . There were but two , but they were everywhere . If he shut out the sight , there came the room with every well - known object — some , indeed , that he would have forgotten , if he had gone over its contents from memory — each in its accustomed place . The body was in _ its _ place , and its eyes were as he saw them when he stole away . He got up , and rushed into the field without . The figure was behind him . He re - entered the shed , and shrunk down once more . The eyes were there , before he had laid himself along . And here he remained in such terror as none but he can know , trembling in every limb , and the cold sweat starting from every pore , when suddenly there arose upon the night - wind the noise of distant shouting , and the roar of voices mingled in alarm and wonder . Any sound of men in that lonely place , even though it conveyed a real cause of alarm , was something to him . He regained his strength and energy at the prospect of personal danger ; and springing to his feet , rushed into the open air . The broad sky seemed on fire . Rising into the air with showers of sparks , and rolling one above the other , were sheets of flame , lighting the atmosphere for miles round , and driving clouds of smoke in the direction where he stood . The shouts grew louder as new voices swelled the roar , and he could hear the cry of Fire ! mingled with the ringing of an alarm - bell , the fall of heavy bodies , and the crackling of flames as they twined round some new obstacle , and shot aloft as though refreshed by food . The noise increased as he looked . There were people there — men and women — light , bustle . It was like new life to him . He darted onward — straight , headlong — dashing through brier and brake , and leaping gate and fence as madly as his dog , who careered with loud and sounding bark before him . He came upon the spot . There were half - dressed figures tearing to and fro , some endeavouring to drag the frightened horses from the stables , others driving the cattle from the yard and out - houses , and others coming laden from the burning pile , amidst a shower of falling sparks , and the tumbling down of red - hot beams . The apertures , where doors and windows stood an hour ago , disclosed a mass of raging fire ; walls rocked and crumbled into the burning well ; the molten lead and iron poured down , white hot , upon the ground . Women and children shrieked , and men encouraged each other with noisy shouts and cheers . The clanking of the engine - pumps , and the spirting and hissing of the water as it fell upon the blazing wood , added to the tremendous roar . He shouted , too , till he was hoarse ; and flying from memory and himself , plunged into the thickest of the throng . Hither and thither he dived that night : now working at the pumps , and now hurrying through the smoke and flame , but never ceasing to engage himself wherever noise and men were thickest . Up and down the ladders , upon the roofs of buildings , over floors that quaked and trembled with his weight , under the lee of falling bricks and stones , in every part of that great fire was he ; but he bore a charmed life , and had neither scratch nor bruise , nor weariness nor thought , till morning dawned again , and only smoke and blackened ruins remained . This mad excitement over , there returned , with ten - fold force , the dreadful consciousness of his crime . He looked suspiciously about him , for the men were conversing in groups , and he feared to be the subject of their talk . The dog obeyed the significant beck of his finger , and they drew off , stealthily , together . He passed near an engine where some men were seated , and they called to him to share in their refreshment . He took some bread and meat ; and as he drank a draught of beer , heard the firemen , who were from London , talking about the murder . “
178414	178418	178411	178411	they	4092	” said one : “
178446	178511	178411	178411	they	4092	” He hurried off , and walked till he almost dropped upon the ground ; then lay down in a lane , and had a long , but broken and uneasy sleep . He wandered on again , irresolute and undecided , and oppressed with the fear of another solitary night . Suddenly , he took the desperate resolution to going back to London . “
178524	178528	178514	178514	somebody	5093	” he thought . “
178582	178796	178577	178577	I	0	” He acted upon this impulse without delay , and choosing the least frequented roads began his journey back , resolved to lie concealed within a short distance of the metropolis , and , entering it at dusk by a circuitous route , to proceed straight to that part of it which he had fixed on for his destination . The dog , though . If any description of him were out , it would not be forgotten that the dog was missing , and had probably gone with him . This might lead to his apprehension as he passed along the streets . He resolved to drown him , and walked on , looking about for a pond : picking up a heavy stone and tying it to his handkerchief as he went . The animal looked up into his master ’s face while these preparations were making ; whether his instinct apprehended something of their purpose , or the robber ’s sidelong look at him was sterner than ordinary , he skulked a little farther in the rear than usual , and cowered as he came more slowly along . When his master halted at the brink of a pool , and looked round to call him , he stopped outright . “
178806	178842	178798	178798	you	4099	” cried Sikes . The animal came up from the very force of habit ; but as Sikes stooped to attach the handkerchief to his throat , he uttered a low growl and started back . “
178846	179104	179105	179105	He	4100	” said the robber . The dog wagged his tail , but moved not . Sikes made a running noose and called him again . The dog advanced , retreated , paused an instant , and scoured away at his hardest speed . The man whistled again and again , and sat down and waited in the expectation that he would return . But no dog appeared , and at length he resumed his journey . CHAPTER XLIX . MONKS AND MR . BROWNLOW AT LENGTH MEET . THEIR CONVERSATION , AND THE INTELLIGENCE THAT INTERRUPTS IT The twilight was beginning to close in , when Mr. Brownlow alighted from a hackney - coach at his own door , and knocked softly . The door being opened , a sturdy man got out of the coach and stationed himself on one side of the steps , while another man , who had been seated on the box , dismounted too , and stood upon the other side . At a sign from Mr. Brownlow , they helped out a third man , and taking him between them , hurried him into the house . This man was Monks . They walked in the same manner up the stairs without speaking , and Mr. Brownlow , preceding them , led the way into a back - room . At the door of this apartment , Monks , who had ascended with evident reluctance , stopped . The two men looked at the old gentleman as if for instructions . “
179110	179115	179105	179105	He	4100	” said Mr. Browlow . “
179153	179154	179140	179141	the police	5396	” “
179163	179167	179157	179157	you	4101	” asked Monks . “
179179	179191	179170	179170	you	4101	” replied Mr. Brownlow , confronting him with a steady look . “
179271	179272	179263	179263	your	4543	” “
179290	179308	179310	179310	mine	4543	” asked Monks , looking from one to the other of the men who stood beside him . “
179312	179317	179310	179310	mine	4543	” replied Mr. Brownlow . “
179422	179435	179436	179436	You	4543	” Monks was plainly disconcerted , and alarmed besides . He hesitated . “
179441	179452	179436	179436	You	4543	” said Mr. Brownlow , with perfect firmness and composure . “
179541	179552	179553	179553	You	4543	” Monks muttered some unintelligible words , but wavered still . “
179558	179563	179553	179553	You	4543	” said Mr. Brownlow . “
179577	179583	179553	179553	You	4543	” Still the man hesitated . “
179592	179597	179584	179584	I	0	” said Mr. Brownlow , “
179615	179616	179609	179609	I	0	” “
179620	179626	179609	179609	I	0	” demanded Monks with a faltering tongue,—“is
179633	179634	179609	179609	I	0	” “
179637	179676	179609	179609	I	0	” Monks looked at the old gentleman , with an anxious eye ; but , reading in his countenance nothing but severity and determination , walked into the room , and , shrugging his shoulders , sat down . “
179684	179692	179609	179609	I	0	” said Mr. Brownlow to the attendants , “
179699	179712	179696	179696	I	0	” The men obeyed , and the two were left alone together . “
179720	179731	179718	179718	sir	4543	” said Monks , throwing down his hat and cloak , “
179739	179740	179733	179737	my father ’s oldest friend	4116	” “
179755	179760	179752	179753	young man	2851	” returned Mr. Brownlow ; “
179931	179932	179924	179924	your	4127	” “
179942	179966	179924	179924	your	4127	” asked the other , after contemplating , half in silence , and half in dogged wonder , the agitation of his companion . “
179974	179975	179924	179924	your	4127	” “
179978	179983	179992	179992	hers	4128	” replied Mr. Brownlow , “
180042	180043	180033	180033	you	4127	” “
180050	180091	180033	180033	you	4127	” said Monks ( to retain his assumed designation ) after a long silence , during which he had jerked himself in sullen defiance to and fro , and Mr. Brownlow had sat , shading his face with his hand . “
180100	180101	180095	180095	you	4127	” “
180107	180115	180116	180117	a brother	4131	” said Mr. Brownlow , rousing himself : “

180162	180166	180145	180145	you	4127	” replied Monks . “
180192	180193	180184	180184	You	4127	” “
180206	180211	180212	180212	I	0	” said Mr. Brownlow . “
180261	180262	180263	180263	I	0	” “
180271	180279	180280	180280	You	4127	” interrupted Monks with a jeering laugh . “
180292	180293	180280	180280	You	4127	” “
180299	180305	180295	180295	I	0	” pursued the old gentleman , “
180445	180446	180427	180427	she	4825	” “
180453	180457	180427	180427	she	4825	” said Monks , “
180463	180464	180427	180427	she	4825	” “
180474	180479	180427	180427	she	4825	” returned Mr. Brownlow , “
180530	180531	180533	180533	I	0	” “
180535	180561	180533	180533	I	0	” said Monks , turning away his eyes and beating his foot upon the ground , as a man who is determined to deny everything . “
180564	180565	180566	180566	Your	4127	” “
180593	180598	180578	180578	you	4127	” returned Mr. Brownlow . “
180676	180677	180678	180678	I	0	” “
180684	180688	180678	180678	I	0	” rejoined Monks . “
180697	180698	180699	180701	These new friends	4150	” “
180705	180710	180699	180701	These new friends	4150	” said Mr. Brownlow , “
180781	180782	180759	180759	daughters	4154	” “
180789	180793	180794	180794	They	4150	” asked Monks . “
180797	180809	180794	180794	They	4150	” said Mr. Brownlow , without seeming to hear the interruption , “
180895	180922	180889	180890	His daughter	4168	” The old gentleman paused ; Monks was biting his lips , with his eyes fixed upon the floor ; seeing this , he immediately resumed : “
180956	180957	180958	180958	Your	0	” “
180965	180975	180958	180958	Your	0	” observed Monks , moving restlessly in his chair . “
180992	180997	180958	180958	Your	0	” returned Mr. Brownlow , “
181157	181217	181219	181219	he	2303	” At this part of the recital Monks held his breath , and listened with a face of intense eagerness , though his eyes were not directed towards the speaker . As Mr. Brownlow paused , he changed his position with the air of one who has experienced a sudden relief , and wiped his hot face and hands . “
181233	181250	181251	181251	he	2303	” said Mr. Brownlow , slowly , and fixing his eyes upon the other ’s face , “
181256	181257	181251	181251	he	2303	” “
181264	181282	181251	181251	he	2303	” interrupted Monks in a tone intended to appear incredulous , but savouring more of disagreeable surprise . “
181499	181500	181501	181501	I	0	” “
181504	181514	181515	181515	I	0	” said Mr. Brownlow , after a short pause , “
181618	181636	181638	181639	your brother	4190	” Monks drew his breath yet more freely , and looked round with a smile of triumph . “
181641	181654	181638	181639	your brother	4190	” said Mr. Brownlow , drawing nearer to the other ’s chair , “
181691	181692	181722	181722	me	0	” “
181695	181699	181722	181722	me	0	” cried Monks . “

181843	181848	181833	181833	I	0	” asked Monks hastily . “

181859	181860	181857	181857	I	0	” “
181867	181872	181873	181873	I	0	” replied Mr. Brownlow . “

181896	181900	181888	181888	you	4189	” stammered Monks . “
181908	181909	181903	181903	you	4189	” “
181914	181924	181903	181903	you	4189	” returned the old gentleman with a searching glance . “
182129	182130	182121	182121	I	0	” “
182138	182145	182133	182133	you	423	” said Monks , rising boldly , “

182212	182220	182206	182206	I	0	” replied Mr. Brownlow , rising too ; “

182497	182508	182484	182484	you	423	” returned the coward , overwhelmed by these accumulated charges . “
182512	182517	182484	182484	you	423	” cried the gentleman , “
182590	182591	182620	182620	you	423	” “
182596	182600	182601	182601	I	0	” interposed Monks . “
182639	182640	182631	182631	I	0	” “
182650	182655	182631	182631	I	0	” replied Mr. Brownlow . “

182826	182886	182887	182888	The man	843	” While Monks was pacing up and down , meditating with dark and evil looks on this proposal and the possibilities of evading it : torn by his fears on the one hand and his hatred on the other : the door was hurriedly unlocked , and a gentleman ( Mr. Losberne ) entered the room in violent agitation . “
182893	182897	182887	182888	The man	843	” he cried . “
182904	182905	182906	182907	The murderer	8300	” “
182909	182914	182906	182907	The murderer	8300	” asked Mr. Brownlow . “
182919	182924	182906	182907	The murderer	8300	” replied the other . “

183199	183212	183215	183215	you	0	” They left the room , and the door was again locked . “
183218	183226	183215	183215	you	0	” asked the doctor in a whisper . “

183384	184301	184302	184302	I	0	” The two gentlemen hastily separated ; each in a fever of excitement wholly uncontrollable . CHAPTER L. THE PURSUIT AND ESCAPE Near to that part of the Thames on which the church at Rotherhithe abuts , where the buildings on the banks are dirtiest and the vessels on the river blackest with the dust of colliers and the smoke of close - built low - roofed houses , there exists the filthiest , the strangest , the most extraordinary of the many localities that are hidden in London , wholly unknown , even by name , to the great mass of its inhabitants . To reach this place , the visitor has to penetrate through a maze of close , narrow , and muddy streets , thronged by the roughest and poorest of waterside people , and devoted to the traffic they may be supposed to occasion . The cheapest and least delicate provisions are heaped in the shops ; the coarsest and commonest articles of wearing apparel dangle at the salesman ’s door , and stream from the house - parapet and windows . Jostling with unemployed labourers of the lowest class , ballast - heavers , coal - whippers , brazen women , ragged children , and the raff and refuse of the river , he makes his way with difficulty along , assailed by offensive sights and smells from the narrow alleys which branch off on the right and left , and deafened by the clash of ponderous waggons that bear great piles of merchandise from the stacks of warehouses that rise from every corner . Arriving , at length , in streets remoter and less - frequented than those through which he has passed , he walks beneath tottering house - fronts projecting over the pavement , dismantled walls that seem to totter as he passes , chimneys half crushed half hesitating to fall , windows guarded by rusty iron bars that time and dirt have almost eaten away , every imaginable sign of desolation and neglect . In such a neighborhood , beyond Dockhead in the Borough of Southwark , stands Jacob ’s Island , surrounded by a muddy ditch , six or eight feet deep and fifteen or twenty wide when the tide is in , once called Mill Pond , but known in the days of this story as Folly Ditch . It is a creek or inlet from the Thames , and can always be filled at high water by opening the sluices at the Lead Mills from which it took its old name . At such times , a stranger , looking from one of the wooden bridges thrown across it at Mill Lane , will see the inhabitants of the houses on either side lowering from their back doors and windows , buckets , pails , domestic utensils of all kinds , in which to haul the water up ; and when his eye is turned from these operations to the houses themselves , his utmost astonishment will be excited by the scene before him . Crazy wooden galleries common to the backs of half a dozen houses , with holes from which to look upon the slime beneath ; windows , broken and patched , with poles thrust out , on which to dry the linen that is never there ; rooms so small , so filthy , so confined , that the air would seem too tainted even for the dirt and squalor which they shelter ; wooden chambers thrusting themselves out above the mud , and threatening to fall into it — as some have done ; dirt - besmeared walls and decaying foundations ; every repulsive lineament of poverty , every loathsome indication of filth , rot , and garbage ; all these ornament the banks of Folly Ditch . In Jacob ’s Island , the warehouses are roofless and empty ; the walls are crumbling down ; the windows are windows no more ; the doors are falling into the streets ; the chimneys are blackened , but they yield no smoke . Thirty or forty years ago , before losses and chancery suits came upon it , it was a thriving place ; but now it is a desolate island indeed . The houses have no owners ; they are broken open , and entered upon by those who have the courage ; and there they live , and there they die . They must have powerful motives for a secret residence , or be reduced to a destitute condition indeed , who seek a refuge in Jacob ’s Island . In an upper room of one of these houses — a detached house of fair size , ruinous in other respects , but strongly defended at door and window : of which house the back commanded the ditch in manner already described — there were assembled three men , who , regarding each other every now and then with looks expressive of perplexity and expectation , sat for some time in profound and gloomy silence . One of these was Toby Crackit , another Mr. Chitling , and the third a robber of fifty years , whose nose had been almost beaten in , in some old scuffle , and whose face bore a frightful scar which might probably be traced to the same occasion . This man was a returned transport , and his name was Kags . “
184305	184313	184302	184302	I	0	” said Toby turning to Mr. Chitling , “
184341	184342	184337	184339	my fine feller	4269	” “
184352	184356	184346	184346	you	0	” said Kags . “
184375	184385	184361	184361	you	0	” replied Mr. Chitling , with a melancholy air . “
184393	184397	184390	184391	young gentleman	4270	” said Toby , “
184472	184473	184447	184449	a young gentleman	1110	” “
184516	184557	184510	184511	the Judges	4279	” added Mr. Kags . There was a short silence , after which Toby Crackit , seeming to abandon as hopeless any further effort to maintain his usual devil - may - care swagger , turned to Chitling and said , “
184564	184565	184560	184560	Fagin	161	” “
184625	184626	184620	184620	they	4282	” “
184630	184631	184632	184633	Poor Bet	166	” “
184649	184660	184635	184635	She	4283	” replied Chitling , his countenance falling more and more , “
184699	184700	184679	184679	they	4282	” “
184708	184712	184713	184713	He	164	” demanded Kags . “
184732	184736	184726	184726	he	164	” replied Chitling . “
184781	184782	184726	184726	he	164	” “
184788	184796	184726	184726	he	164	” observed Toby , biting his lips . “
184807	184808	184797	184801	There ’s more than one	4289	” “
184814	184818	184797	184801	There ’s more than one	4289	” said Kags : “
184878	184879	184875	184875	G	285	” “
184888	184892	184884	184885	the people	397	” said Chitling ; “
185041	185154	185034	185034	they	2215	” The horror - stricken witness of this scene pressed his hands upon his ears , and with his eyes closed got up and paced violently to and fro , like one distracted . While he was thus engaged , and the two men sat by in silence with their eyes fixed upon the floor , a pattering noise was heard upon the stairs , and Sikes ’s dog bounded into the room . They ran to the window , downstairs , and into the street . The dog had jumped in at an open window ; he made no attempt to follow them , nor was his master to be seen . “
185162	185170	185171	185171	He	271	” said Toby when they had returned . “
185185	185186	185178	185178	I	0	” “
185201	185219	185193	185193	he	271	” said Kags , stooping down to examine the animal , who lay panting on the floor . “
185235	185236	185232	185232	himself	271	” “
185247	185259	185237	185237	He	271	” said Chitling after watching the dog some time in silence . “
185277	185278	185269	185269	he	271	” “
185286	185290	185291	185291	He	271	” exclaimed Toby . “
185340	185341	185362	185362	you	4303	” “
185342	185351	185362	185362	you	4303	He”—(none of them called the murderer by his old name)—“He
185365	185374	185362	185362	you	4303	” said Chitling . Toby shook his head . “
185379	185383	185376	185376	he	271	” said Kags , “
185434	185581	185427	185427	he	271	” This solution , appearing the most probable one , was adopted as the right ; the dog , creeping under a chair , coiled himself up to sleep , without more notice from anybody . It being now dark , the shutter was closed , and a candle lighted and placed upon the table . The terrible events of the last two days had made a deep impression on all three , increased by the danger and uncertainty of their own position . They drew their chairs closer together , starting at every sound . They spoke little , and that in whispers , and were as silent and awe - stricken as if the remains of the murdered woman lay in the next room . They had sat thus , some time , when suddenly was heard a hurried knocking at the door below . “
185585	185670	185582	185583	Young Bates	286	” said Kags , looking angrily round , to check the fear he felt himself . The knocking came again . No , it was n’t he . He never knocked like that . Crackit went to the window , and shaking all over , drew in his head . There was no need to tell them who it was ; his pale face was enough . The dog too was on the alert in an instant , and ran whining to the door . “
185677	185686	185671	185671	We	4306	” he said , taking up the candle . “
185695	185705	185671	185671	We	4306	” asked the other man in a hoarse voice . “
185715	185716	185708	185708	He	4307	” “
185725	185944	185708	185708	He	4307	” said Kags , taking down a candle from the chimney - piece , and lighting it , with such a trembling hand that the knocking was twice repeated before he had finished . Crackit went down to the door , and returned followed by a man with the lower part of his face buried in a handkerchief , and another tied over his head under his hat . He drew them slowly off . Blanched face , sunken eyes , hollow cheeks , beard of three days ’ growth , wasted flesh , short thick breath ; it was the very ghost of Sikes . He laid his hand upon a chair which stood in the middle of the room , but shuddering as he was about to drop into it , and seeming to glance over his shoulder , dragged it back close to the wall — as close as it would go — and ground it against it — and sat down . Not a word had been exchanged . He looked from one to another in silence . If an eye were furtively raised and met his , it was instantly averted . When his hollow voice broke silence , they all three started . They seemed never to have heard its tones before . “
185951	185955	185708	185708	He	4307	” he asked . “
185962	185963	185708	185708	He	4307	” “
185981	185982	185708	185708	He	4307	” “
185985	185991	185708	185708	He	4307	” They were silent again . “
185996	186007	185708	185708	He	4307	” said Sikes , passing his hand across his forehead . “
186016	186029	186009	186009	you	4308	” There was an uneasy movement among them , but nobody spoke . “
186036	186046	186048	186048	you	4308	” said Sikes , turning his face to Crackit , “
186066	186067	186048	186048	you	4308	” “
186079	186114	186068	186068	You	4308	” returned the person addressed , after some hesitation . Sikes carried his eyes slowly up the wall behind him : rather trying to turn his head than actually doing it : and said , “
186126	186132	186151	186151	they	4310	” They shook their heads . “
186138	186148	186151	186151	they	4310	” he retorted with the same glance behind him . “
186164	186217	186218	186218	Toby	201	” Crackit intimated , by a motion of his hand as he left the room , that there was nothing to fear ; and directly came back with Charley Bates behind him . Sikes sat opposite the door , so that the moment the boy entered the room he encountered his figure . “
186220	186235	186218	186218	Toby	201	” said the boy falling back , as Sikes turned his eyes towards him , “
186246	186288	186239	186239	you	201	” There had been something so tremendous in the shrinking off of the three , that the wretched man was willing to propitiate even this lad . Accordingly he nodded , and made as though he would shake hands with him . “
186297	186306	186307	186307	Charley	164	” said the boy , retreating still farther . “
186309	186316	186239	186239	you	201	” said Sikes , stepping forward . “
186326	186327	186319	186319	you	164	” “
186334	186357	186332	186332	me	0	” answered the boy , still retreating , and looking , with horror in his eyes , upon the murderer ’s face . “
186361	186386	186358	186359	You monster	4313	” The man stopped half - way , and they looked at each other ; but Sikes ’s eyes sunk gradually to the ground . “
186391	186410	186388	186388	you	4314	” cried the boy shaking his clenched fist , and becoming more and more excited as he spoke . “
186512	186765	186499	186499	you	4314	” Pouring out these cries , and accompanying them with violent gesticulation , the boy actually threw himself , single - handed , upon the strong man , and in the intensity of his energy and the suddenness of his surprise , brought him heavily to the ground . The three spectators seemed quite stupefied . They offered no interference , and the boy and man rolled on the ground together ; the former , heedless of the blows that showered upon him , wrenching his hands tighter and tighter in the garments about the murderer ’s breast , and never ceasing to call for help with all his might . The contest , however , was too unequal to last long . Sikes had him down , and his knee was on his throat , when Crackit pulled him back with a look of alarm , and pointed to the window . There were lights gleaming below , voices in loud and earnest conversation , the tramp of hurried footsteps — endless they seemed in number — crossing the nearest wooden bridge . One man on horseback seemed to be among the crowd ; for there was the noise of hoofs rattling on the uneven pavement . The gleam of lights increased ; the footsteps came more thickly and noisily on . Then , came a loud knocking at the door , and then a hoarse murmur from such a multitude of angry voices as would have made the boldest quail . “
186768	186780	186781	186781	He	4322	” shrieked the boy in a voice that rent the air . “
186790	186791	186793	186794	the King	1077	” “
186798	186814	186793	186794	the King	1077	” cried the voices without ; and the hoarse cry arose again , but louder . “
186820	186825	186826	186826	I	0	” screamed the boy . “
186850	186898	186793	186794	the King	1077	” Strokes , thick and heavy , rattled upon the door and lower window - shutters as he ceased to speak , and a loud huzzah burst from the crowd ; giving the listener , for the first time , some adequate idea of its immense extent . “
186915	186942	186793	186794	the King	1077	” cried Sikes fiercely ; running to and fro , and dragging the boy , now , as easily as if he were an empty sack . “
186948	186962	186793	186794	the King	1077	” He flung him in , bolted it , and turned the key . “
186969	186970	186793	186794	the King	1077	” “
186977	186996	186793	186794	the King	1077	” replied Crackit , who , with the other two men , still remained quite helpless and bewildered . “
187004	187005	186793	186794	the King	1077	” “
187012	187013	186793	186794	the King	1077	” “
187019	187020	186793	186794	the King	1077	” “
187027	187028	186793	186794	the King	1077	” “
187032	187047	186793	186794	the King	1077	” cried the desperate ruffian , throwing up the sash and menacing the crowd . “
187058	187155	187052	187052	I	0	” Of all the terrific yells that ever fell on mortal ears , none could exceed the cry of the infuriated throng . Some shouted to those who were nearest to set the house on fire ; others roared to the officers to shoot him dead . Among them all , none showed such fury as the man on horseback , who , throwing himself out of the saddle , and bursting through the crowd as if he were parting water , cried , beneath the window , in a voice that rose above all others , “
187166	187294	187052	187052	I	0	” The nearest voices took up the cry , and hundreds echoed it . Some called for ladders , some for sledge - hammers ; some ran with torches to and fro as if to seek them , and still came back and roared again ; some spent their breath in impotent curses and execrations ; some pressed forward with the ecstasy of madmen , and thus impeded the progress of those below ; some among the boldest attempted to climb up by the water - spout and crevices in the wall ; and all waved to and fro , in the darkness beneath , like a field of corn moved by an angry wind : and joined from time to time in one loud furious roar . “
187298	187317	187052	187052	I	0	” cried the murderer , as he staggered back into the room , and shut the faces out , “
187372	187815	187816	187816	They	4328	” The panic - stricken men pointed to where such articles were kept ; the murderer , hastily selecting the longest and strongest cord , hurried up to the house - top . All the windows in the rear of the house had been long ago bricked up , except one small trap in the room where the boy was locked , and that was too small even for the passage of his body . But , from this aperture , he had never ceased to call on those without , to guard the back ; and thus , when the murderer emerged at last on the house - top by the door in the roof , a loud shout proclaimed the fact to those in front , who immediately began to pour round , pressing upon each other in an unbroken stream . He planted a board , which he had carried up with him for the purpose , so firmly against the door that it must be matter of great difficulty to open it from the inside ; and creeping over the tiles , looked over the low parapet . The water was out , and the ditch a bed of mud . The crowd had been hushed during these few moments , watching his motions and doubtful of his purpose , but the instant they perceived it and knew it was defeated , they raised a cry of triumphant execration to which all their previous shouting had been whispers . Again and again it rose . Those who were at too great a distance to know its meaning , took up the sound ; it echoed and re - echoed ; it seemed as though the whole city had poured its population out to curse him . On pressed the people from the front — on , on , on , in a strong struggling current of angry faces , with here and there a glaring torch to lighten them up , and show them out in all their wrath and passion . The houses on the opposite side of the ditch had been entered by the mob ; sashes were thrown up , or torn bodily out ; there were tiers and tiers of faces in every window ; cluster upon cluster of people clinging to every house - top . Each little bridge ( and there were three in sight ) bent beneath the weight of the crowd upon it . Still the current poured on to find some nook or hole from which to vent their shouts , and only for an instant see the wretch . “
187821	187830	187816	187816	They	4328	” cried a man on the nearest bridge . “
187833	187848	187849	187849	I	0	” The crowd grew light with uncovered heads ; and again the shout uprose . “
187855	187865	187849	187849	I	0	” cried an old gentleman from the same quarter , “
187888	188385	187880	187880	he	4330	” There was another roar . At this moment the word was passed among the crowd that the door was forced at last , and that he who had first called for the ladder had mounted into the room . The stream abruptly turned , as this intelligence ran from mouth to mouth ; and the people at the windows , seeing those upon the bridges pouring back , quitted their stations , and running into the street , joined the concourse that now thronged pell - mell to the spot they had left : each man crushing and striving with his neighbor , and all panting with impatience to get near the door , and look upon the criminal as the officers brought him out . The cries and shrieks of those who were pressed almost to suffocation , or trampled down and trodden under foot in the confusion , were dreadful ; the narrow ways were completely blocked up ; and at this time , between the rush of some to regain the space in front of the house , and the unavailing struggles of others to extricate themselves from the mass , the immediate attention was distracted from the murderer , although the universal eagerness for his capture was , if possible , increased . The man had shrunk down , thoroughly quelled by the ferocity of the crowd , and the impossibility of escape ; but seeing this sudden change with no less rapidity than it had occurred , he sprang upon his feet , determined to make one last effort for his life by dropping into the ditch , and , at the risk of being stifled , endeavouring to creep away in the darkness and confusion . Roused into new strength and energy , and stimulated by the noise within the house which announced that an entrance had really been effected , he set his foot against the stack of chimneys , fastened one end of the rope tightly and firmly round it , and with the other made a strong running noose by the aid of his hands and teeth almost in a second . He could let himself down by the cord to within a less distance of the ground than his own height , and had his knife ready in his hand to cut it then and drop . At the very instant when he brought the loop over his head previous to slipping it beneath his arm - pits , and when the old gentleman before - mentioned ( who had clung so tight to the railing of the bridge as to resist the force of the crowd , and retain his position ) earnestly warned those about him that the man was about to lower himself down — at that very instant the murderer , looking behind him on the roof , threw his arms above his head , and uttered a yell of terror . “
188390	188870	187880	187880	he	4330	” he cried in an unearthly screech . Staggering as if struck by lightning , he lost his balance and tumbled over the parapet . The noose was on his neck . It ran up with his weight , tight as a bow - string , and swift as the arrow it speeds . He fell for five - and - thirty feet . There was a sudden jerk , a terrific convulsion of the limbs ; and there he hung , with the open knife clenched in his stiffening hand . The old chimney quivered with the shock , but stood it bravely . The murderer swung lifeless against the wall ; and the boy , thrusting aside the dangling body which obscured his view , called to the people to come and take him out , for God ’s sake . A dog , which had lain concealed till now , ran backwards and forwards on the parapet with a dismal howl , and collecting himself for a spring , jumped for the dead man ’s shoulders . Missing his aim , he fell into the ditch , turning completely over as he went ; and striking his head against a stone , dashed out his brains . CHAPTER LI . AFFORDING AN EXPLANATION OF MORE MYSTERIES THAN ONE , AND COMPREHENDING A PROPOSAL OF MARRIAGE WITH NO WORD OF SETTLEMENT OR PIN - MONEY The events narrated in the last chapter were yet but two days old , when Oliver found himself , at three o’clock in the afternoon , in a travelling - carriage rolling fast towards his native town . Mrs. Maylie , and Rose , and Mrs. Bedwin , and the good doctor were with him : and Mr. Brownlow followed in a post - chaise , accompanied by one other person whose name had not been mentioned . They had not talked much upon the way ; for Oliver was in a flutter of agitation and uncertainty which deprived him of the power of collecting his thoughts , and almost of speech , and appeared to have scarcely less effect on his companions , who shared it , in at least an equal degree . He and the two ladies had been very carefully made acquainted by Mr. Brownlow with the nature of the admissions which had been forced from Monks ; and although they knew that the object of their present journey was to complete the work which had been so well begun , still the whole matter was enveloped in enough of doubt and mystery to leave them in endurance of the most intense suspense . The same kind friend had , with Mr. Losberne ’s assistance , cautiously stopped all channels of communication through which they could receive intelligence of the dreadful occurrences that had so recently taken place . “
188876	188880	187880	187880	he	4330	” he said , “
188910	189034	188882	188882	they	4331	” So , they travelled on in silence : each busied with reflections on the object which had brought them together : and no one disposed to give utterance to the thoughts which crowded upon all . But if Oliver , under these influences , had remained silent while they journeyed towards his birth - place by a road he had never seen , how the whole current of his recollections ran back to old times , and what a crowd of emotions were wakened up in his breast , when they turned into that which he had traversed on foot : a poor houseless , wandering boy , without a friend to help him , or a roof to shelter his head . “
189040	189059	188882	188882	they	4331	” cried Oliver , eagerly clasping the hand of Rose , and pointing out at the carriage window ; “
189126	189127	189128	189128	You	0	” “
189134	189147	189128	189128	You	0	” replied Rose , gently taking his folded hands between her own . “
189185	189186	189199	189199	we’ll	4337	” “
189191	189195	189199	189199	we’ll	4337	” said Oliver , “
189230	189233	189228	189228	we	4337	” Rose nodded “
189236	189252	189228	189228	we	4337	” for the boy was smiling through such happy tears that she could not speak . “
189269	189273	189263	189263	you	0	” said Oliver . “
189342	189353	189328	189328	He	4336	” cried the boy with a burst of affectionate emotion ; “
189375	190032	189355	189355	I	0	” As they approached the town , and at length drove through its narrow streets , it became matter of no small difficulty to restrain the boy within reasonable bounds . There was Sowerberry ’s the undertaker ’s just as it used to be , only smaller and less imposing in appearance than he remembered it — there were all the well - known shops and houses , with almost every one of which he had some slight incident connected — there was Gamfield ’s cart , the very cart he used to have , standing at the old public - house door — there was the workhouse , the dreary prison of his youthful days , with its dismal windows frowning on the street — there was the same lean porter standing at the gate , at sight of whom Oliver involuntarily shrunk back , and then laughed at himself for being so foolish , then cried , then laughed again — there were scores of faces at the doors and windows that he knew quite well — there was nearly everything as if he had left it but yesterday , and all his recent life had been but a happy dream . But it was pure , earnest , joyful reality . They drove straight to the door of the chief hotel ( which Oliver used to stare up at , with awe , and think a mighty palace , but which had somehow fallen off in grandeur and size ) ; and here was Mr. Grimwig all ready to receive them , kissing the young lady , and the old one too , when they got out of the coach , as if he were the grandfather of the whole party , all smiles and kindness , and not offering to eat his head — no , not once ; not even when he contradicted a very old postboy about the nearest road to London , and maintained he knew it best , though he had only come that way once , and that time fast asleep . There was dinner prepared , and there were bedrooms ready , and everything was arranged as if by magic . Notwithstanding all this , when the hurry of the first half - hour was over , the same silence and constraint prevailed that had marked their journey down . Mr. Brownlow did not join them at dinner , but remained in a separate room . The two other gentlemen hurried in and out with anxious faces , and , during the short intervals when they were present , conversed apart . Once , Mrs. Maylie was called away , and after being absent for nearly an hour , returned with eyes swollen with weeping . All these things made Rose and Oliver , who were not in any new secrets , nervous and uncomfortable . They sat wondering , in silence ; or , if they exchanged a few words , spoke in whispers , as if they were afraid to hear the sound of their own voices . At length , when nine o’clock had come , and they began to think they were to hear no more that night , Mr. Losberne and Mr. Grimwig entered the room , followed by Mr. Brownlow and a man whom Oliver almost shrieked with surprise to see ; for they told him it was his brother , and it was the same man he had met at the market - town , and seen looking in with Fagin at the window of his little room . Monks cast a look of hate , which , even then , he could not dissemble , at the astonished boy , and sat down near the door . Mr. Brownlow , who had papers in his hand , walked to a table near which Rose and Oliver were seated . “
190039	190043	189355	189355	I	0	” said he , “
190091	190092	190116	190116	I	0	” “
190096	190107	190116	190116	I	0	” said the person addressed , turning away his face . “
190125	190126	190127	190128	This child	4344	” “
190130	190148	190127	190128	This child	4344	” said Mr. Brownlow , drawing Oliver to him , and laying his hand upon his head , “
190181	190182	190171	190172	Agnes Fleming	261	” “
190185	190205	190171	190172	Agnes Fleming	261	” said Monks , scowling at the trembling boy : the beating of whose heart he might have heard . “
190212	190213	190208	190210	the bastard child	4350	” “
190219	190226	190216	190216	you	4351	” said Mr. Brownlow , sternly , “
190268	190269	190261	190261	He	4344	” “
190277	190283	190284	190284	You	4351	” was the sullen reply . “
190290	190301	190302	190302	I	0	” He pointed impatiently to the papers as he spoke . “
190310	190321	190302	190302	I	0	” said Mr. Brownlow , looking round upon the listeners . “
190327	190331	190325	190325	You	4351	” returned Monks . “
190439	190448	190438	190438	yourself	4362	” ; he addressed himself to Mr. Brownlow ; “
190498	190499	190491	190491	Agnes	261	” “
190505	190510	190491	190491	Agnes	261	” asked Mr. Brownlow . “
190751	190752	190748	190748	he	4583	” “
190756	190772	190748	190748	he	4583	” said Mr. Brownlow , as Oliver ’s tears fell fast . Monks was silent . “
190776	190785	190795	190795	He	4583	” said Mr. Brownlow , speaking for him , “
191035	191036	191037	191038	My mother	4905	” “
191040	191049	191037	191038	My mother	4905	” said Monks , in a louder tone , “
191225	191244	191254	191255	this man’s	4395	” There was a short silence here , until Mr. Brownlow took up the thread of the narrative . “
191249	191253	191254	191255	this man’s	4395	” he said , “
191355	191356	191379	191379	she	1840	” “
191361	191365	191379	191379	she	1840	” said Monks , “
191552	191649	191544	191544	I	0	” As the villain folded his arms tight together , and muttered curses on himself in the impotence of baffled malice , Mr. Brownlow turned to the terrified group beside him , and explained that the Jew , who had been his old accomplice and confidant , had a large reward for keeping Oliver ensnared : of which some part was to be given up , in the event of his being rescued : and that a dispute on this head had led to their visit to the country house for the purpose of identifying him . “
191655	191664	191544	191544	I	0	” said Mr. Brownlow , turning to Monks . “
191692	191700	191701	191701	You	4405	” answered Monks without raising his eyes . “
191708	191739	191701	191701	You	4405	” Mr. Brownlow merely nodded to Mr. Grimwig , who disappearing with great alacrity , shortly returned , pushing in Mrs. Bumble , and dragging her unwilling consort after him . “
191747	191758	191762	191763	little Oliver	123	” cried Mr. Bumble , with ill - feigned enthusiasm , “
191785	191786	191776	191776	I	0	” “
191793	191798	191791	191791	fool	4408	” murmured Mrs. Bumble . “
191808	191814	191805	191806	Mrs. Bumble	258	” remonstrated the workhouse master . “
191865	191876	191854	191854	he	4614	” said Mr. Bumble , halting for an appropriate comparison . “
191912	191913	191895	191895	he	123	” “
191918	191925	191895	191895	he	123	” said Mr. Grimwig , tartly ; “
191930	191931	191895	191895	he	123	” “
191940	191945	191932	191932	I	0	” replied Mr. Bumble . “
191960	191992	191953	191953	I	0	” This salutation was addressed to Mr. Brownlow , who had stepped up to within a short distance of the respectable couple . He inquired , as he pointed to Monks , “
191999	192000	191994	191994	you	4543	” “
192003	192009	192012	192012	you	4543	” replied Mrs. Bumble flatly . “
192017	192026	192012	192012	you	4543	” said Mr. Brownlow , addressing her spouse . “
192036	192041	192027	192027	I	0	” said Mr. Bumble . “
192049	192050	192027	192027	I	0	” “
192053	192058	192027	192027	I	0	” replied Mrs. Bumble . “
192072	192077	192027	192027	I	0	” said Mr. Brownlow . “
192081	192086	192027	192027	I	0	” replied the matron . “
192100	192151	192152	192152	You	4543	” Again Mr. Brownlow nodded to Mr. Grimwig ; and again that gentleman limped away with extraordinary readiness . But not again did he return with a stout man and wife ; for this time , he led in two palsied women , who shook and tottered as they walked . “
192162	192173	192152	192152	You	4543	” said the foremost one , raising her shrivelled hand , “
192188	192189	192175	192175	you	4543	” “
192194	192208	192175	192175	you	4543	” said the other , looking round her and wagging her toothless jaws . “
192215	192216	192219	192219	her	214	” “
192253	192258	192241	192241	you	4543	” said the first . “
192261	192266	192241	192241	you	4543	” added the second , “
192299	192300	192295	192295	we	4420	” “
192308	192313	192315	192315	she	214	” resumed the first , “
192367	192368	192343	192343	her	214	” “
192378	192389	192370	192370	you	4427	” asked Mr. Grimwig with a motion towards the door . “
192392	192397	192370	192370	you	4427	” replied the woman ; “
192399	192402	192412	192412	he	3359	he”—she pointed to Monks—“has
192457	192458	192437	192437	I	0	” “
192461	192466	192437	192437	I	0	” replied Mr. Brownlow , “
192495	192496	192497	192497	I	0	” “
192500	192522	192497	192497	I	0	” said Mr. Bumble , looking about him with great ruefulness , as Mr. Grimwig disappeared with the two old women : “
192539	192540	192497	192497	I	0	” “
192545	192550	192497	192497	I	0	” replied Mr. Brownlow . “
192567	192568	192572	192573	Mrs. Bumble	258	” “
192582	192600	192575	192575	She	258	” urged Mr. Bumble ; first looking round to ascertain that his partner had left the room . “
192606	192611	192612	192612	You	4427	” replied Mr. Brownlow . “
192654	192655	192679	192680	a ass	4433	” “
192662	192675	192679	192680	a ass	4433	” said Mr. Bumble , squeezing his hat emphatically in both hands , “
192721	192755	192756	192757	Young lady	2766	” Laying great stress on the repetition of these two words , Mr. Bumble fixed his hat on very tight , and putting his hands in his pockets , followed his helpmate downstairs . “
192759	192768	192756	192757	Young lady	2766	” said Mr. Brownlow , turning to Rose , “
192793	192794	192796	192796	they	4438	” “
192817	192821	192809	192809	they	4438	” said Rose , “
192840	192841	192832	192832	I	0	” “
192844	192856	192832	192832	I	0	” returned the old gentleman , drawing her arm through his ; “
192877	192878	192869	192869	you	0	” “
192881	192885	192869	192869	you	0	” replied Monks . “
192892	192897	192886	192886	I	0	” said Rose faintly . “
192904	192908	192898	192898	I	0	” returned Monks . “
192921	192926	192909	192914	The father of the unhappy Agnes	4441	” said Mr. Brownlow . “
192938	192939	192940	192941	The child	306	” “
192943	192947	192940	192941	The child	306	” replied Monks , “
193003	193004	192992	193001	some wretched cottagers , who reared it as their own	4450	” “
193008	193020	192992	193001	some wretched cottagers , who reared it as their own	4450	” said Mr. Brownlow , signing to Mrs. Maylie to approach . “
193024	193025	192992	193001	some wretched cottagers , who reared it as their own	4450	” “
193039	193043	192992	193001	some wretched cottagers , who reared it as their own	4450	” said Monks , “
193075	193076	193082	193082	she	4905	” “
193084	193085	193082	193082	she	4905	” “
193311	193312	193288	193288	I	0	” “
193319	193320	193314	193314	you	0	” “
193328	193329	193314	193314	you	0	” “
193337	193350	193314	193314	you	0	” cried Mrs. Maylie , folding the fainting girl in her arms ; “
193382	193383	193373	193375	My sweet companion	4470	” “
193391	193399	193400	193405	The kindest , best of friends	4473	” cried Rose , clinging to her . “
193419	193420	193421	193421	You	0	” “
193448	193457	193445	193445	she	1840	” said Mrs. Maylie , embracing her tenderly . “
193491	193492	193493	193494	Not aunt	4480	” “
193496	193507	193493	193494	Not aunt	4480	” cried Oliver , throwing his arms about her neck ; “
193542	193673	193535	193535	Rose	252	” Let the tears which fell , and the broken words which were exchanged in the long close embrace between the orphans , be sacred . A father , sister , and mother , were gained , and lost , in that one moment . Joy and grief were mingled in the cup ; but there were no bitter tears : for even grief itself arose so softened , and clothed in such sweet and tender recollections , that it became a solemn pleasure , and lost all character of pain . They were a long , long time alone . A soft tap at the door , at length announced that some one was without . Oliver opened it , glided away , and gave place to Harry Maylie . “
193679	193691	193674	193674	I	0	” he said , taking a seat beside the lovely girl . “
193700	193701	193695	193695	I	0	” “
193709	193717	193702	193702	I	0	” he added after a lengthened silence ; “
193749	193750	193739	193739	I	0	” “
193753	193757	193758	193758	You	0	” said Rose . “
193765	193766	193758	193758	You	0	” “
193790	193791	193792	193792	I	0	” “
193795	193796	193792	193792	I	0	” “
193806	193812	193792	193792	I	0	” pursued the young man , “
193866	193867	193897	193897	her	4487	” “
193881	193886	193897	193897	her	4487	” said Rose firmly . “
193928	193932	193897	193897	her	4487	” said Rose , “
193953	193954	193995	193995	You	0	” “
193958	193961	193995	193995	You	0	tonight,”—Harry began . “
193967	193972	193995	193995	You	0	” replied Rose softly , “
193993	193994	193995	193995	You	0	” “
194004	194009	193995	193995	You	0	” urged her lover . “
194015	194025	194013	194013	Harry	250	” said the young lady , bursting into tears ; “
194037	194038	194013	194013	Harry	250	” “
194046	194054	194013	194013	Harry	250	” said Harry , taking her hand . “
194067	194068	194062	194062	you	0	” “
194080	194084	194077	194077	I	0	” cried Rose . “
194117	194118	194112	194112	we	4490	” “
194125	194137	194112	194112	we	4490	” said the young man , detaining her as she rose . “
194230	194231	194234	194234	you	0	” “
194237	194241	194234	194234	you	0	” she faltered . “
194420	194421	194415	194415	I	0	” “
194432	194489	194415	194415	I	0	” said Mr. Grimwig , waking up , and pulling his pocket - handkerchief from over his head . Truth to tell , the supper had been waiting a most unreasonable time . Neither Mrs. Maylie , nor Harry , nor Rose ( who all came in together ) , could offer a word in extenuation . “
194500	194505	194490	194490	I	0	” said Mr. Grimwig , “
194538	194609	194610	194610	Oliver	123	” Mr. Grimwig lost no time in carrying this notice into effect upon the blushing girl ; and the example , being contagious , was followed both by the doctor and Mr. Brownlow : some people affirm that Harry Maylie had been observed to set it , originally , in a dark room adjoining ; but the best authorities consider this downright scandal : he being young and a clergyman . “
194615	194620	194610	194610	Oliver	123	” said Mrs. Maylie , “
194650	197249	197251	197253	the young gentleman	1112	” It is a world of disappointment : often to the hopes we most cherish , and hopes that do our nature the greatest honour . Poor Dick was dead ! CHAPTER LII . FAGIN ’S LAST NIGHT ALIVE The court was paved , from floor to roof , with human faces . Inquisitive and eager eyes peered from every inch of space . From the rail before the dock , away into the sharpest angle of the smallest corner in the galleries , all looks were fixed upon one man — Fagin . Before him and behind : above , below , on the right and on the left : he seemed to stand surrounded by a firmament , all bright with gleaming eyes . He stood there , in all this glare of living light , with one hand resting on the wooden slab before him , the other held to his ear , and his head thrust forward to enable him to catch with greater distinctness every word that fell from the presiding judge , who was delivering his charge to the jury . At times , he turned his eyes sharply upon them to observe the effect of the slightest featherweight in his favour ; and when the points against him were stated with terrible distinctness , looked towards his counsel , in mute appeal that he would , even then , urge something in his behalf . Beyond these manifestations of anxiety , he stirred not hand or foot . He had scarcely moved since the trial began ; and now that the judge ceased to speak , he still remained in the same strained attitude of close attention , with his gaze bent on him , as though he listened still . A slight bustle in the court , recalled him to himself . Looking round , he saw that the jurymen had turned together , to consider their verdict . As his eyes wandered to the gallery , he could see the people rising above each other to see his face : some hastily applying their glasses to their eyes : and others whispering their neighbours with looks expressive of abhorrence . A few there were , who seemed unmindful of him , and looked only to the jury , in impatient wonder how they could delay . But in no one face — not even among the women , of whom there were many there — could he read the faintest sympathy with himself , or any feeling but one of all - absorbing interest that he should be condemned . As he saw all this in one bewildered glance , the deathlike stillness came again , and looking back he saw that the jurymen had turned towards the judge . Hush ! They only sought permission to retire . He looked , wistfully , into their faces , one by one when they passed out , as though to see which way the greater number leant ; but that was fruitless . The jailer touched him on the shoulder . He followed mechanically to the end of the dock , and sat down on a chair . The man pointed it out , or he would not have seen it . He looked up into the gallery again . Some of the people were eating , and some fanning themselves with handkerchiefs ; for the crowded place was very hot . There was one young man sketching his face in a little note - book . He wondered whether it was like , and looked on when the artist broke his pencil - point , and made another with his knife , as any idle spectator might have done . In the same way , when he turned his eyes towards the judge , his mind began to busy itself with the fashion of his dress , and what it cost , and how he put it on . There was an old fat gentleman on the bench , too , who had gone out , some half an hour before , and now come back . He wondered within himself whether this man had been to get his dinner , what he had had , and where he had had it ; and pursued this train of careless thought until some new object caught his eye and roused another . Not that , all this time , his mind was , for an instant , free from one oppressive overwhelming sense of the grave that opened at his feet ; it was ever present to him , but in a vague and general way , and he could not fix his thoughts upon it . Thus , even while he trembled , and turned burning hot at the idea of speedy death , he fell to counting the iron spikes before him , and wondering how the head of one had been broken off , and whether they would mend it , or leave it as it was . Then , he thought of all the horrors of the gallows and the scaffold — and stopped to watch a man sprinkling the floor to cool it — and then went on to think again . At length there was a cry of silence , and a breathless look from all towards the door . The jury returned , and passed him close . He could glean nothing from their faces ; they might as well have been of stone . Perfect stillness ensued — not a rustle — not a breath — Guilty . The building rang with a tremendous shout , and another , and another , and then it echoed loud groans , that gathered strength as they swelled out , like angry thunder . It was a peal of joy from the populace outside , greeting the news that he would die on Monday . The noise subsided , and he was asked if he had anything to say why sentence of death should not be passed upon him . He had resumed his listening attitude , and looked intently at his questioner while the demand was made ; but it was twice repeated before he seemed to hear it , and then he only muttered that he was an old man — an old man — and so , dropping into a whisper , was silent again . The judge assumed the black cap , and the prisoner still stood with the same air and gesture . A woman in the gallery , uttered some exclamation , called forth by this dread solemnity ; he looked hastily up as if angry at the interruption , and bent forward yet more attentively . The address was solemn and impressive ; the sentence fearful to hear . But he stood , like a marble figure , without the motion of a nerve . His haggard face was still thrust forward , his under - jaw hanging down , and his eyes staring out before him , when the jailer put his hand upon his arm , and beckoned him away . He gazed stupidly about him for an instant , and obeyed . They led him through a paved room under the court , where some prisoners were waiting till their turns came , and others were talking to their friends , who crowded round a grate which looked into the open yard . There was nobody there to speak to _ him _ ; but , as he passed , the prisoners fell back to render him more visible to the people who were clinging to the bars : and they assailed him with opprobrious names , and screeched and hissed . He shook his fist , and would have spat upon them ; but his conductors hurried him on , through a gloomy passage lighted by a few dim lamps , into the interior of the prison . Here , he was searched , that he might not have about him the means of anticipating the law ; this ceremony performed , they led him to one of the condemned cells , and left him there — alone . He sat down on a stone bench opposite the door , which served for seat and bedstead ; and casting his blood - shot eyes upon the ground , tried to collect his thoughts . After awhile , he began to remember a few disjointed fragments of what the judge had said : though it had seemed to him , at the time , that he could not hear a word . These gradually fell into their proper places , and by degrees suggested more : so that in a little time he had the whole , almost as it was delivered . To be hanged by the neck , till he was dead — that was the end . To be hanged by the neck till he was dead . As it came on very dark , he began to think of all the men he had known who had died upon the scaffold ; some of them through his means . They rose up , in such quick succession , that he could hardly count them . He had seen some of them die,—and had joked too , because they died with prayers upon their lips . With what a rattling noise the drop went down ; and how suddenly they changed , from strong and vigorous men to dangling heaps of clothes ! Some of them might have inhabited that very cell — sat upon that very spot . It was very dark ; why did n’t they bring a light ? The cell had been built for many years . Scores of men must have passed their last hours there . It was like sitting in a vault strewn with dead bodies — the cap , the noose , the pinioned arms , the faces that he knew , even beneath that hideous veil.—Light , light ! At length , when his hands were raw with beating against the heavy door and walls , two men appeared : one bearing a candle , which he thrust into an iron candlestick fixed against the wall : the other dragging in a mattress on which to pass the night ; for the prisoner was to be left alone no more . Then came the night — dark , dismal , silent night . Other watchers are glad to hear this church - clock strike , for they tell of life and coming day . To him they brought despair . The boom of every iron bell came laden with the one , deep , hollow sound — Death . What availed the noise and bustle of cheerful morning , which penetrated even there , to him ? It was another form of knell , with mockery added to the warning . The day passed off . Day ? There was no day ; it was gone as soon as come — and night came on again ; night so long , and yet so short ; long in its dreadful silence , and short in its fleeting hours . At one time he raved and blasphemed ; and at another howled and tore his hair . Venerable men of his own persuasion had come to pray beside him , but he had driven them away with curses . They renewed their charitable efforts , and he beat them off . Saturday night . He had only one night more to live . And as he thought of this , the day broke — Sunday . It was not until the night of this last awful day , that a withering sense of his helpless , desperate state came in its full intensity upon his blighted soul ; not that he had ever held any defined or positive hope of mercy , but that he had never been able to consider more than the dim probability of dying so soon . He had spoken little to either of the two men , who relieved each other in their attendance upon him ; and they , for their parts , made no effort to rouse his attention . He had sat there , awake , but dreaming . Now , he started up , every minute , and with gasping mouth and burning skin , hurried to and fro , in such a paroxysm of fear and wrath that even they — used to such sights — recoiled from him with horror . He grew so terrible , at last , in all the tortures of his evil conscience , that one man could not bear to sit there , eyeing him alone ; and so the two kept watch together . He cowered down upon his stone bed , and thought of the past . He had been wounded with some missiles from the crowd on the day of his capture , and his head was bandaged with a linen cloth . His red hair hung down upon his bloodless face ; his beard was torn , and twisted into knots ; his eyes shone with a terrible light ; his unwashed flesh crackled with the fever that burnt him up . Eight — nine — then . If it was not a trick to frighten him , and those were the real hours treading on each other ’s heels , where would he be , when they came round again ! Eleven ! Another struck , before the voice of the previous hour had ceased to vibrate . At eight , he would be the only mourner in his own funeral train ; at eleven — Those dreadful walls of Newgate , which have hidden so much misery and such unspeakable anguish , not only from the eyes , but , too often , and too long , from the thoughts , of men , never held so dread a spectacle as that . The few who lingered as they passed , and wondered what the man was doing who was to be hanged tomorrow , would have slept but ill that night , if they could have seen him . From early in the evening until nearly midnight , little groups of two and three presented themselves at the lodge - gate , and inquired , with anxious faces , whether any reprieve had been received . These being answered in the negative , communicated the welcome intelligence to clusters in the street , who pointed out to one another the door from which he must come out , and showed where the scaffold would be built , and , walking with unwilling steps away , turned back to conjure up the scene . By degrees they fell off , one by one ; and , for an hour , in the dead of night , the street was left to solitude and darkness . The space before the prison was cleared , and a few strong barriers , painted black , had been already thrown across the road to break the pressure of the expected crowd , when Mr. Brownlow and Oliver appeared at the wicket , and presented an order of admission to the prisoner , signed by one of the sheriffs . They were immediately admitted into the lodge . “
197260	197272	197251	197253	the young gentleman	1112	” said the man whose duty it was to conduct them . “
197283	197284	197251	197253	the young gentleman	1112	” “
197293	197298	197251	197253	the young gentleman	1112	” rejoined Mr. Brownlow ; “
197351	197410	197345	197345	he	4344	” These few words had been said apart , so as to be inaudible to Oliver . The man touched his hat ; and glancing at Oliver with some curiousity , opened another gate , opposite to that by which they had entered , and led them on , through dark and winding ways , towards the cells . “
197413	197434	197345	197345	he	4344	” said the man , stopping in a gloomy passage where a couple of workmen were making some preparations in profound silence—“this
197458	197698	197699	197700	Good boy	5144	” He led them into a stone kitchen , fitted with coppers for dressing the prison food , and pointed to a door . There was an open grating above it , through which came the sound of men ’s voices , mingled with the noise of hammering , and the throwing down of boards . They were putting up the scaffold . From this place , they passed through several strong gates , opened by other turnkeys from the inner side ; and , having entered an open yard , ascended a flight of narrow steps , and came into a passage with a row of strong doors on the left hand . Motioning them to remain where they were , the turnkey knocked at one of these with his bunch of keys . The two attendants , after a little whispering , came out into the passage , stretching themselves as if glad of the temporary relief , and motioned the visitors to follow the jailer into the cell . They did so . The condemned criminal was seated on his bed , rocking himself from side to side , with a countenance more like that of a snared beast than the face of a man . His mind was evidently wandering to his old life , for he continued to mutter , without appearing conscious of their presence otherwise than as a part of his vision . “
197707	197711	197702	197702	Charley	164	” he mumbled . “
197740	197764	197726	197727	the gentleman	4594	” The jailer took the disengaged hand of Oliver ; and , whispering him not to be alarmed , looked on without speaking . “
197771	197775	197726	197727	the gentleman	4594	” cried Fagin . “
197837	197838	197839	197839	Fagin	161	” “
197841	197846	197839	197839	Fagin	161	” said the jailer . “
197851	197871	197872	197874	An old man	2096	” cried the Jew , falling instantly , into the attitude of listening he had assumed upon his trial . “
197886	197887	197879	197884	a very old , old man	4520	” “
197890	197906	197879	197884	a very old , old man	4520	” said the turnkey , laying his hand upon his breast to keep him down . “
197933	197934	197929	197929	you	161	” “
197942	197960	197935	197935	I	0	” he replied , looking up with a face retaining no human expression but rage and terror . “
197974	198005	198006	198006	Steady	294	” As he spoke he caught sight of Oliver and Mr. Brownlow . Shrinking to the furthest corner of the seat , he demanded to know what they wanted there . “
198008	198018	198006	198006	Steady	294	” said the turnkey , still holding him down . “
198045	198046	198047	198047	You	4543	” “
198052	198058	198032	198032	you	4543	” said Mr. Brownlow advancing , “
198076	198077	198074	198074	Monks	226	” “
198085	198089	198074	198074	Monks	226	” replied Fagin . “
198098	198099	198090	198090	I	0	” “
198106	198112	198090	198090	I	0	” said Mr. Brownlow solemnly , “
198160	198161	198162	198162	Oliver	123	” “
198164	198172	198162	198162	Oliver	123	” cried Fagin , beckoning to him . “
198183	198184	198178	198178	me	0	” “
198190	198206	198178	198178	me	0	” said Oliver in a low voice , as he relinquished Mr. Brownlow ’s hand . “
198210	198219	198178	198178	me	0	” said Fagin , drawing Oliver towards him , “
198259	198260	198252	198252	I	0	” “
198265	198269	198252	198252	I	0	” returned Oliver . “
198302	198303	198252	198252	I	0	” “
198308	198328	198330	198330	I	0	” replied Fagin , pushing the boy before him towards the door , and looking vacantly over his head . “
198358	198359	198330	198330	I	0	” “
198368	198378	198330	198330	I	0	” cried the boy with a burst of tears . “
198387	198391	198330	198330	I	0	” said Fagin . “
198429	198430	198416	198416	you	123	” “
198441	198446	198416	198416	you	123	” inquired the turnkey . “
198451	198456	198416	198416	you	123	” replied Mr. Brownlow . “
198471	198472	198458	198458	I	0	” “
198480	198489	198478	198478	sir	4543	” replied the man , shaking his head . “
198496	198509	198490	198490	You	4543	” The door of the cell opened , and the attendants returned . “
198516	198520	198490	198490	You	4543	” cried Fagin . “
198532	200401	200402	200402	AGNES	261	” The men laid hands upon him , and disengaging Oliver from his grasp , held him back . He struggled with the power of desperation , for an instant ; and then sent up cry upon cry that penetrated even those massive walls , and rang in their ears until they reached the open yard . It was some time before they left the prison . Oliver nearly swooned after this frightful scene , and was so weak that for an hour or more , he had not the strength to walk . Day was dawning when they again emerged . A great multitude had already assembled ; the windows were filled with people , smoking and playing cards to beguile the time ; the crowd were pushing , quarrelling , joking . Everything told of life and animation , but one dark cluster of objects in the centre of all — the black stage , the cross - beam , the rope , and all the hideous apparatus of death . CHAPTER LIII . AND LAST The fortunes of those who have figured in this tale are nearly closed . The little that remains to their historian to relate , is told in few and simple words . Before three months had passed , Rose Fleming and Harry Maylie were married in the village church which was henceforth to be the scene of the young clergyman ’s labours ; on the same day they entered into possession of their new and happy home . Mrs. Maylie took up her abode with her son and daughter - in - law , to enjoy , during the tranquil remainder of her days , the greatest felicity that age and worth can know — the contemplation of the happiness of those on whom the warmest affections and tenderest cares of a well - spent life , have been unceasingly bestowed . It appeared , on full and careful investigation , that if the wreck of property remaining in the custody of Monks ( which had never prospered either in his hands or in those of his mother ) were equally divided between himself and Oliver , it would yield , to each , little more than three thousand pounds . By the provisions of his father ’s will , Oliver would have been entitled to the whole ; but Mr. Brownlow , unwilling to deprive the elder son of the opportunity of retrieving his former vices and pursuing an honest career , proposed this mode of distribution , to which his young charge joyfully acceded . Monks , still bearing that assumed name , retired with his portion to a distant part of the New World ; where , having quickly squandered it , he once more fell into his old courses , and , after undergoing a long confinement for some fresh act of fraud and knavery , at length sunk under an attack of his old disorder , and died in prison . As far from home , died the chief remaining members of his friend Fagin ’s gang . Mr. Brownlow adopted Oliver as his son . Removing with him and the old housekeeper to within a mile of the parsonage - house , where his dear friends resided , he gratified the only remaining wish of Oliver ’s warm and earnest heart , and thus linked together a little society , whose condition approached as nearly to one of perfect happiness as can ever be known in this changing world . Soon after the marriage of the young people , the worthy doctor returned to Chertsey , where , bereft of the presence of his old friends , he would have been discontented if his temperament had admitted of such a feeling ; and would have turned quite peevish if he had known how . For two or three months , he contented himself with hinting that he feared the air began to disagree with him ; then , finding that the place really no longer was , to him , what it had been , he settled his business on his assistant , took a bachelor ’s cottage outside the village of which his young friend was pastor , and instantaneously recovered . Here he took to gardening , planting , fishing , carpentering , and various other pursuits of a similar kind : all undertaken with his characteristic impetuosity . In each and all he has since become famous throughout the neighborhood , as a most profound authority . Before his removal , he had managed to contract a strong friendship for Mr. Grimwig , which that eccentric gentleman cordially reciprocated . He is accordingly visited by Mr. Grimwig a great many times in the course of the year . On all such occasions , Mr. Grimwig plants , fishes , and carpenters , with great ardour ; doing everything in a very singular and unprecedented manner , but always maintaining with his favourite asseveration , that his mode is the right one . On Sundays , he never fails to criticise the sermon to the young clergyman ’s face : always informing Mr. Losberne , in strict confidence afterwards , that he considers it an excellent performance , but deems it as well not to say so . It is a standing and very favourite joke , for Mr. Brownlow to rally him on his old prophecy concerning Oliver , and to remind him of the night on which they sat with the watch between them , waiting his return ; but Mr. Grimwig contends that he was right in the main , and , in proof thereof , remarks that Oliver did not come back after all ; which always calls forth a laugh on his side , and increases his good humour . Mr. Noah Claypole : receiving a free pardon from the Crown in consequence of being admitted approver against Fagin : and considering his profession not altogether as safe a one as he could wish : was , for some little time , at a loss for the means of a livelihood , not burdened with too much work . After some consideration , he went into business as an informer , in which calling he realises a genteel subsistence . His plan is , to walk out once a week during church time attended by Charlotte in respectable attire . The lady faints away at the doors of charitable publicans , and the gentleman being accommodated with three - penny worth of brandy to restore her , lays an information next day , and pockets half the penalty . Sometimes Mr. Claypole faints himself , but the result is the same . Mr. and Mrs. Bumble , deprived of their situations , were gradually reduced to great indigence and misery , and finally became paupers in that very same workhouse in which they had once lorded it over others . Mr. Bumble has been heard to say , that in this reverse and degradation , he has not even spirits to be thankful for being separated from his wife . As to Mr. Giles and Brittles , they still remain in their old posts , although the former is bald , and the last - named boy quite grey . They sleep at the parsonage , but divide their attentions so equally among its inmates , and Oliver and Mr. Brownlow , and Mr. Losberne , that to this day the villagers have never been able to discover to which establishment they properly belong . Master Charles Bates , appalled by Sikes ’s crime , fell into a train of reflection whether an honest life was not , after all , the best . Arriving at the conclusion that it certainly was , he turned his back upon the scenes of the past , resolved to amend it in some new sphere of action . He struggled hard , and suffered much , for some time ; but , having a contented disposition , and a good purpose , succeeded in the end ; and , from being a farmer ’s drudge , and a carrier ’s lad , he is now the merriest young grazier in all Northamptonshire . And now , the hand that traces these words , falters , as it approaches the conclusion of its task ; and would weave , for a little longer space , the thread of these adventures . I would fain linger yet with a few of those among whom I have so long moved , and share their happiness by endeavouring to depict it . I would show Rose Maylie in all the bloom and grace of early womanhood , shedding on her secluded path in life soft and gentle light , that fell on all who trod it with her , and shone into their hearts . I would paint her the life and joy of the fire - side circle and the lively summer group ; I would follow her through the sultry fields at noon , and hear the low tones of her sweet voice in the moonlit evening walk ; I would watch her in all her goodness and charity abroad , and the smiling untiring discharge of domestic duties at home ; I would paint her and her dead sister ’s child happy in their love for one another , and passing whole hours together in picturing the friends whom they had so sadly lost ; I would summon before me , once again , those joyous little faces that clustered round her knee , and listen to their merry prattle ; I would recall the tones of that clear laugh , and conjure up the sympathising tear that glistened in the soft blue eye . These , and a thousand looks and smiles , and turns of thought and speech — I would fain recall them every one . How Mr. Brownlow went on , from day to day , filling the mind of his adopted child with stores of knowledge , and becoming attached to him , more and more , as his nature developed itself , and showed the thriving seeds of all he wished him to become — how he traced in him new traits of his early friend , that awakened in his own bosom old remembrances , melancholy and yet sweet and soothing — how the two orphans , tried by adversity , remembered its lessons in mercy to others , and mutual love , and fervent thanks to Him who had protected and preserved them — these are all matters which need not to be told . I have said that they were truly happy ; and without strong affection and humanity of heart , and gratitude to that Being whose code is Mercy , and whose great attribute is Benevolence to all things that breathe , happiness can never be attained . Within the altar of the old village church there stands a white marble tablet , which bears as yet but one word : “
