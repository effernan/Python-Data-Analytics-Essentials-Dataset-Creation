4871	4974	4856	4856	He	280	‘ Here I am ! See me ! Shaken out of destiny ’s dice - box into the company of a mere smuggler;--shut up with a poor little contraband trader , whose papers are wrong , and whom the police lay hold of besides , for placing his boat ( as a means of getting beyond the frontier ) at the disposition of other little people whose papers are wrong ; and he instinctively recognises my position , even by this light and in this place . It ’s well done ! By Heaven ! I win , however the game goes . ’
4987	4994	4995	4995	he	280	‘ What ’s the hour now ? ’
5013	5024	4995	4995	he	280	‘ A little half - hour after mid - day . ’
5025	5088	5089	5090	Signor Cavalletto	282	‘ Good ! The President will have a gentleman before him soon . Come ! Shall I tell you on what accusation ? It must be now , or never , for I shall not return here . Either I shall go free , or I shall go to be made ready for shaving . You know where they keep the razor . ’
5111	5167	5168	5168	His	282	‘ I am a’--Monsieur Rigaud stood up to say it--‘I am a cosmopolitan gentleman . I own no particular country . My father was Swiss -- Canton de Vaud . My mother was French by blood , English by birth . I myself was born in Belgium . I am a citizen of the world . ’
5238	5318	5319	5319	He	912	‘ Call me five - and - thirty years of age . I have seen the world . I have lived here , and lived there , and lived like a gentleman everywhere . I have been treated and respected as a gentleman universally . If you try to prejudice me by making out that I have lived by my wits -- how do your lawyers live -- your politicians -- your intriguers -- your men of the Exchange ? ’
5347	5466	5319	5319	He	912	‘ Two years ago I came to Marseilles . I admit that I was poor ; I had been ill . When your lawyers , your politicians , your intriguers , your men of the Exchange fall ill , and have not scraped money together , _ they _ become poor . I put up at the Cross of Gold,--kept then by Monsieur Henri Barronneau -- sixty - five at least , and in a failing state of health . I had lived in the house some four months when Monsieur Henri Barronneau had the misfortune to die;--at any rate , not a rare misfortune , that . It happens without any aid of mine , pretty often . ’
5477	5524	5319	5319	He	912	’ ends , Monsieur Rigaud had the magnanimity to throw him another . He lighted the second at the ashes of the first , and smoked on , looking sideways at his companion , who , preoccupied with his own case , hardly looked at him . ‘
5623	5685	5609	5609	you	916	’ He had a certain air of being a handsome man -- which he was not ; and a certain air of being a well - bred man -- which he was not . It was mere swagger and challenge ; but in this particular , as in many others , blustering assertion goes for proof , half over the world . ‘
5710	5758	5707	5707	I	0	’ His eye happening to light upon John Baptist with this inquiry , that little man briskly shook his head in the negative , and repeated in an argumentative tone under his breath , altro , altro , altro , altro -- an infinite number of times . ‘
5987	6026	5980	5980	I	0	’ If the playfulness of Monsieur Rigaud were at all expressed by his smile at this point , the relations of Madame Rigaud might have said that they would have much preferred his correcting that unfortunate woman seriously . ‘
6354	6390	6461	6461	you	286	’ He stepped aside to the ledge where the vine leaves yet lay strewn about , collected two or three , and stood wiping his hands upon them , with his back to the light . ‘
6393	6400	6461	6461	you	286	’ he demanded after a silence , ‘
6410	6411	6402	6402	you	286	’ ‘
6416	6444	6402	6402	you	286	’ returned the little man , who had risen , and was brightening his knife upon his shoe , as he leaned an arm against the wall . ‘
6450	6459	6447	6447	you	286	’ John Baptist polished his knife in silence . ‘
6472	6473	6464	6464	I	0	’ ‘
6478	6493	6464	6464	I	0	’ returned John Baptist . The word was an apology now , and stood for ‘
6500	6501	6464	6464	I	0	’ ‘
6505	6506	6464	6464	I	0	’ ‘
6514	6515	6507	6507	Presidents	929	’ ‘
6518	6537	6507	6507	Presidents	929	’ cried the other , uneasily flinging the end of his cloak over his shoulder with an oath , ‘
6544	6545	6541	6541	their	931	’ ‘
6552	6710	6547	6547	I	0	’ murmured John Baptist to himself , as he bent his head to put his knife in his sash . Nothing more was said on either side , though they both began walking to and fro , and necessarily crossed at every turn . Monsieur Rigaud sometimes stopped , as if he were going to put his case in a new light , or make some irate remonstrance ; but Signor Cavalletto continuing to go slowly to and fro at a grotesque kind of jog - trot pace with his eyes turned downward , nothing came of these inclinings . By - and - by the noise of the key in the lock arrested them both . The sound of voices succeeded , and the tread of feet . The door clashed , the voices and the feet came on , and the prison - keeper slowly ascended the stairs , followed by a guard of soldiers . ‘
6716	6735	6789	6790	a crowd	932	’ said he , pausing for a moment at the grate , with his keys in his hands , ‘
6743	6744	6789	6790	a crowd	932	’ ‘
6755	6756	6752	6752	I	0	’ ‘
6763	6768	6789	6790	a crowd	932	’ returned the jailer , ‘
6802	6824	6789	6790	a crowd	932	’ He passed on out of sight , and unlocked and unbarred a low door in the corner of the chamber . ‘
6827	6839	6789	6790	a crowd	932	’ said he , as he opened it and appeared within , ‘
6843	7109	6789	6790	a crowd	932	’ There is no sort of whiteness in all the hues under the sun at all like the whiteness of Monsieur Rigaud ’s face as it was then . Neither is there any expression of the human countenance at all like that expression in every little line of which the frightened heart is seen to beat . Both are conventionally compared with death ; but the difference is the whole deep gulf between the struggle done , and the fight at its most desperate extremity . He lighted another of his paper cigars at his companion ’s ; put it tightly between his teeth ; covered his head with a soft slouched hat ; threw the end of his cloak over his shoulder again ; and walked out into the side gallery on which the door opened , without taking any further notice of Signor Cavalletto . As to that little man himself , his whole attention had become absorbed in getting near the door and looking out at it . Precisely as a beast might approach the opened gate of his den and eye the freedom beyond , he passed those few moments in watching and peering , until the door was closed upon him . There was an officer in command of the soldiers ; a stout , serviceable , profoundly calm man , with his drawn sword in his hand , smoking a cigar . He very briefly directed the placing of Monsieur Rigaud in the midst of the party , put himself with consummate indifference at their head , gave the word ‘
7112	7613	6789	6790	a crowd	932	’ and so they all went jingling down the staircase . The door clashed -- the key turned -- and a ray of unusual light , and a breath of unusual air , seemed to have passed through the jail , vanishing in a tiny wreath of smoke from the cigar . Still , in his captivity , like a lower animal -- like some impatient ape , or roused bear of the smaller species -- the prisoner , now left solitary , had jumped upon the ledge , to lose no glimpse of this departure . As he yet stood clasping the grate with both hands , an uproar broke upon his hearing ; yells , shrieks , oaths , threats , execrations , all comprehended in it , though ( as in a storm ) nothing but a raging swell of sound distinctly heard . Excited into a still greater resemblance to a caged wild animal by his anxiety to know more , the prisoner leaped nimbly down , ran round the chamber , leaped nimbly up again , clasped the grate and tried to shake it , leaped down and ran , leaped up and listened , and never rested until the noise , becoming more and more distant , had died away . How many better prisoners have worn their noble hearts out so ; no man thinking of it ; not even the beloved of their souls realising it ; great kings and governors , who had made them captive , careering in the sunlight jauntily , and men cheering them on . Even the said great personages dying in bed , making exemplary ends and sounding speeches ; and polite history , more servile than their instruments , embalming them ! At last , John Baptist , now able to choose his own spot within the compass of those walls for the exercise of his faculty of going to sleep when he would , lay down upon the bench , with his face turned over on his crossed arms , and slumbered . In his submission , in his lightness , in his good humour , in his short - lived passion , in his easy contentment with hard bread and hard stones , in his ready sleep , in his fits and starts , altogether a true son of the land that gave him birth . The wide stare stared itself out for one while ; the Sun went down in a red , green , golden glory ; the stars came out in the heavens , and the fire - flies mimicked them in the lower air , as men may feebly imitate the goodness of a better order of beings ; the long dusty roads and the interminable plains were in repose -- and so deep a hush was on the sea , that it scarcely whispered of the time when it shall give up its dead .

8178	8185	8165	8166	Mr Meagles	288	’ urged a cheerful feminine voice . ‘
8188	8225	8165	8166	Mr Meagles	288	’ repeated Mr Meagles , who appeared ( though without any ill - nature ) to be in that peculiar state of mind in which the last word spoken by anybody else is a new injury . ‘
8242	8298	8231	8231	I	0	’ It was Mrs Meagles who had spoken to Mr Meagles ; and Mrs Meagles was , like Mr Meagles , comely and healthy , with a pleasant English face which had been looking at homely things for five - and - fifty years or more , and shone with a bright reflection of them . ‘
8309	8314	8304	8304	Father	290	’ said Mrs Meagles . ‘

8328	8463	8326	8326	Pet	291	’ repeated Mr Meagles in his injured vein . Pet , however , being close behind him , touched him on the shoulder , and Mr Meagles immediately forgave Marseilles from the bottom of his heart . Pet was about twenty . A fair girl with rich brown hair hanging free in natural ringlets . A lovely girl , with a frank face , and wonderful eyes ; so large , so soft , so bright , set to such perfection in her kind good head . She was round and fresh and dimpled and spoilt , and there was in Pet an air of timidity and dependence which was the best weakness in the world , and gave her the only crowning charm a girl so pretty and pleasant could have been without . ‘
8470	8497	8498	8498	I	0	’ said Mr Meagles in the blandest confidence , falling back a step himself , and handing his daughter a step forward to illustrate his question : ‘
8526	8527	8513	8513	you	949	’ ‘
8539	8540	8513	8513	you	949	’ ‘

8650	8738	8640	8640	Tattycoram	293	’ He spoke to a handsome girl with lustrous dark hair and eyes , and very neatly dressed , who replied with a half curtsey as she passed off in the train of Mrs Meagles and Pet . They crossed the bare scorched terrace all three together , and disappeared through a staring white archway . Mr Meagles ’s companion , a grave dark man of forty , still stood looking towards this archway after they were gone ; until Mr Meagles tapped him on the arm . ‘
8744	8750	8739	8739	I	0	’ said he , starting . ‘

10739	10892	10736	10737	Mr Meagles	288	‘ Ah ! Easily said . I am the son , Mr Meagles , of a hard father and mother . I am the only child of parents who weighed , measured , and priced everything ; for whom what could not be weighed , measured , and priced , had no existence . Strict people as the phrase is , professors of a stern religion , their very religion was a gloomy sacrifice of tastes and sympathies that were never their own , offered up as a part of a bargain for the security of their possessions . Austere faces , inexorable discipline , penance in this world and terror in the next -- nothing graceful or gentle anywhere , and the void in my cowed heart everywhere -- this was my childhood , if I may so misuse the word as to apply it to such a beginning of life . ’
10893	10897	10899	10900	Mr Meagles	288	‘ Really though ? ’
10913	10943	10899	10900	Mr Meagles	288	‘ That was a tough commencement . But come ! You must now study , and profit by , all that lies beyond it , like a practical man . ’
10944	10959	10736	10737	Mr Meagles	288	‘ If the people who are usually called practical , were practical in your direction-- ’
10960	10967	10969	10970	Mr Meagles	288	‘ Why , so they are ! ’
10972	10977	10969	10970	Mr Meagles	288	‘ Are they indeed ? ’
10978	10985	10987	10988	Mr Meagles	288	‘ Well , I suppose so , ’
10994	11014	10987	10988	Mr Meagles	288	‘ Eh ? One can but _ be _ practical , and Mrs Meagles and myself are nothing else . ’

11046	11056	11039	11039	his	304	‘ Enough of me . Here is the boat . ’
11284	11297	11299	11300	Mr Meagles	288	‘ But I bear those monotonous walls no ill - will now , ’
11302	11336	11299	11300	Mr Meagles	288	‘ One always begins to forgive a place as soon as it ’s left behind ; I dare say a prisoner begins to relent towards his prison , after he is let out . ’
11602	11613	11615	11615	she	1076	‘ Do you mean that a prisoner forgives his prison ? ’
11622	11650	11615	11615	she	1076	‘ That was my speculation , Miss Wade . I do n’t pretend to know positively how a prisoner might feel . I never was one before . ’

11665	11674	11661	11661	his	1077	‘ it ’s being so easy to forgive ? ’
11675	11679	11680	11680	Pet	291	‘ I do . ’
11710	11713	11715	11715	he	288	‘ Oh ! ’
11717	11731	11715	11715	he	288	‘ Dear me ! But that ’s a pity , is n’t it ? ’
11732	11739	11741	11742	Miss Wade	305	‘ That I am not credulous ? ’
11744	11764	11741	11742	Miss Wade	305	‘ Not exactly that . Put it another way . That you ca n’t believe it easy to forgive . ’
11765	11769	11770	11770	she	1076	‘ My experience , ’
11774	11798	11770	11770	she	1076	‘ has been correcting my belief in many respects , for some years . It is our natural progress , I have heard . ’
11799	11816	11818	11819	Mr Meagles	288	‘ Well , well ! But it ’s not natural to bear malice , I hope ? ’
11823	11863	11818	11819	Mr Meagles	288	‘ If I had been shut up in any place to pine and suffer , I should always hate that place and wish to burn it down , or raze it to the ground . I know no more . ’
11864	11869	11871	11872	Mr Meagles	288	‘ Strong , sir ? ’
11906	11923	11924	11926	The French gentleman	1082	‘ Rather forcible in our fair friend , you ’ll agree with me , I think ? ’
11930	11935	11924	11926	The French gentleman	1082	‘ Plait - il ? ’
11945	11953	11938	11939	Mr Meagles	288	‘ You are right . My opinion . ’
12337	12477	12479	12479	you’--she	1092	‘ I am self - contained and self - reliant ; your opinion is nothing to me ; I have no interest in you , care nothing for you , and see and hear you with indifference’--this it said plainly . It said so in the proud eyes , in the lifted nostril , in the handsome but compressed and even cruel mouth . Cover either two of those channels of expression , and the third would have said so still . Mask them all , and the mere turn of the head would have shown an unsubduable nature . Pet had moved up to her ( she had been the subject of remark among her family and Mr Clennam , who were now the only other occupants of the room ) , and was standing at her side . ‘

12702	12715	12691	12691	He	290	’ said Mr Meagles , coming forward with his wife and Clennam . ‘

12840	12890	12921	12922	Mr Clennam	304	’ She would not have put out her hand , it seemed , but that Mr Meagles put out his so straight before her that she could not pass it . She put hers in it , and it lay there just as it had lain upon the couch . ‘
12895	12900	12921	12922	Mr Clennam	304	’ said Mr Meagles . ‘

12976	12982	13001	13001	them	1098	’ was the composed reply ; ‘
13012	13051	13053	13053	Father	1100	’ There was something in the manner of these words that jarred upon Pet ’s ear . It implied that what was to be done was necessarily evil , and it caused her to say in a whisper , ‘
13055	13080	13053	13053	Father	1100	’ and to shrink childishly , in her spoilt way , a little closer to him . This was not lost on the speaker . ‘
13085	13089	13053	13053	Father	1100	’ she said , ‘
13099	13105	13106	13106	you	1100	’ looking full upon her , ‘
13196	13371	13169	13169	they	1098	’ With the coldest of farewells , and with a certain worn expression on her beauty that gave it , though scarcely yet in its prime , a wasted look , she left the room . Now , there were many stairs and passages that she had to traverse in passing from that part of the spacious house to the chamber she had secured for her own occupation . When she had almost completed the journey , and was passing along the gallery in which her room was , she heard an angry sound of muttering and sobbing . A door stood open , and within she saw the attendant upon the girl she had just left ; the maid with the curious name . She stood still , to look at this maid . A sullen , passionate girl ! Her rich black hair was all about her face , her face was flushed and hot , and as she sobbed and raged , she plucked at her lips with an unsparing hand . ‘
13375	13386	13169	13169	they	1098	’ said the girl , sobbing and heaving between whiles . ‘

The visitor stood looking at her with a strange attentive smile . It was wonderful to see the fury of the contest in the girl , and the bodily struggle she made as if she were rent by the Demons of old . ‘
13755	13762	13763	13763	You	0	’ So the girl went on . ‘

I know I might keep it off if I only tried hard enough , and sometimes I do try hard enough , and at other times I do n’t and wo n’t . What have I said ! I knew when I said it , it was all lies . They think I am being taken care of somewhere , and have all I want . They are nothing but good to me . I love them dearly ; no people could ever be kinder to a thankless creature than they always are to me . Do , do go away , for I am afraid of you . I am afraid of myself when I feel my temper coming , and I am as much afraid of you . Go away from me , and let me pray and cry myself better ! ’

They mounted up and up , through the musty smell of an old close house , little used , to a large garret bed - room . Meagre and spare , like all the other rooms , it was even uglier and grimmer than the rest , by being the place of banishment for the worn - out furniture . Its movables were ugly old chairs with worn - out seats , and ugly old chairs without any seats ; a threadbare patternless carpet , a maimed table , a crippled wardrobe , a lean set of fire - irons like the skeleton of a set deceased , a washing - stand that looked as if it had stood for ages in a hail of dirty soapsuds , and a bedstead with four bare atomies of posts , each terminating in a spike , as if for the dismal accommodation of lodgers who might prefer to impale themselves . Arthur opened the long low window , and looked out upon the old blasted and blackened forest of chimneys , and the old red glare in the sky , which had seemed to him once upon a time but a nightly reflection of the fiery environment that was presented to his childish fancy in all directions , let it look where it would . He drew in his head again , sat down at the bedside , and looked on at Affery Flintwinch making the bed . ‘

20848	21830	20843	20843	Jeremiah	314	’ She was gone in a moment . Mrs Flintwinch had introduced into the web that his mind was busily weaving , in that old workshop where the loom of his youth had stood , the last thread wanting to the pattern . The airy folly of a boy ’s love had found its way even into that house , and he had been as wretched under its hopelessness as if the house had been a castle of romance . Little more than a week ago at Marseilles , the face of the pretty girl from whom he had parted with regret , had had an unusual interest for him , and a tender hold upon him , because of some resemblance , real or imagined , to this first face that had soared out of his gloomy life into the bright glories of fancy . He leaned upon the sill of the long low window , and looking out upon the blackened forest of chimneys again , began to dream ; for it had been the uniform tendency of this man ’s life -- so much was wanting in it to think about , so much that might have been better directed and happier to speculate upon -- to make him a dreamer , after all . CHAPTER 4 . Mrs Flintwinch has a Dream When Mrs Flintwinch dreamed , she usually dreamed , unlike the son of her old mistress , with her eyes shut . She had a curiously vivid dream that night , and before she had left the son of her old mistress many hours . In fact it was not at all like a dream ; it was so very real in every respect . It happened in this wise . The bed - chamber occupied by Mr and Mrs Flintwinch was within a few paces of that to which Mrs Clennam had been so long confined . It was not on the same floor , for it was a room at the side of the house , which was approached by a steep descent of a few odd steps , diverging from the main staircase nearly opposite to Mrs Clennam ’s door . It could scarcely be said to be within call , the walls , doors , and panelling of the old place were so cumbrous ; but it was within easy reach , in any undress , at any hour of the night , in any temperature . At the head of the bed and within a foot of Mrs Flintwinch ’s ear , was a bell , the line of which hung ready to Mrs Clennam ’s hand . Whenever this bell rang , up started Affery , and was in the sick room before she was awake . Having got her mistress into bed , lighted her lamp , and given her good night , Mrs Flintwinch went to roost as usual , saving that her lord had not yet appeared . It was her lord himself who became -- unlike the last theme in the mind , according to the observation of most philosophers -- the subject of Mrs Flintwinch ’s dream . It seemed to her that she awoke after sleeping some hours , and found Jeremiah not yet abed . That she looked at the candle she had left burning , and , measuring the time like King Alfred the Great , was confirmed by its wasted state in her belief that she had been asleep for some considerable period . That she arose thereupon , muffled herself up in a wrapper , put on her shoes , and went out on the staircase , much surprised , to look for Jeremiah . The staircase was as wooden and solid as need be , and Affery went straight down it without any of those deviations peculiar to dreams . She did not skim over it , but walked down it , and guided herself by the banisters on account of her candle having died out . In one corner of the hall , behind the house - door , there was a little waiting - room , like a well - shaft , with a long narrow window in it as if it had been ripped up . In this room , which was never used , a light was burning . Mrs Flintwinch crossed the hall , feeling its pavement cold to her stockingless feet , and peeped in between the rusty hinges on the door , which stood a little open . She expected to see Jeremiah fast asleep or in a fit , but he was calmly seated in a chair , awake , and in his usual health . But what -- hey?--Lord forgive us!--Mrs Flintwinch muttered some ejaculation to this effect , and turned giddy . For , Mr Flintwinch awake , was watching Mr Flintwinch asleep . He sat on one side of the small table , looking keenly at himself on the other side with his chin sunk on his breast , snoring . The waking Flintwinch had his full front face presented to his wife ; the sleeping Flintwinch was in profile . The waking Flintwinch was the old original ; the sleeping Flintwinch was the double , just as she might have distinguished between a tangible object and its reflection in a glass , Affery made out this difference with her head going round and round . If she had had any doubt which was her own Jeremiah , it would have been resolved by his impatience . He looked about him for an offensive weapon , caught up the snuffers , and , before applying them to the cabbage - headed candle , lunged at the sleeper as though he would have run him through the body . ‘
21840	21886	21887	21887	I	0	’ cried the sleeper , starting . Mr Flintwinch made a movement with the snuffers , as if he would have enforced silence on his companion by putting them down his throat ; the companion , coming to himself , said , rubbing his eyes , ‘

21900	21909	21887	21887	I	0	’ snarled Jeremiah , referring to his watch , ‘

21936	21940	21929	21929	I	0	’ said Double . ‘
21950	21954	21929	21929	I	0	’ muttered Jeremiah . ‘

21975	21990	22021	22022	Mr Flintwinch	320	’ said Double , tying up his throat with sleepy carefulness in a shawl . ‘
22012	22020	22021	22022	Mr Flintwinch	320	’m not as young as I was . ’
22033	22045	22021	22022	Mr Flintwinch	320	‘ You promised me a second glass after I was rested . ’
22046	22050	22052	22052	Jeremiah	314	‘ Drink it ! ’
22054	22072	22077	22077	he	314	‘ and -- choke yourself , I was going to say -- but go , I mean . ’
22093	22102	22104	22104	Double	321	‘ Her port - wine , I believe ? ’

22131	22135	22136	22136	He	321	‘ Your health ! ’
22141	22145	22146	22146	He	321	‘ His health ! ’
22151	22160	22161	22161	He	321	‘ And all friends round St Paul ’s . ’
22458	22467	22469	22470	Mr Flintwinch	320	‘ Why , Affery , woman -- Affery ! ’
22472	22491	22469	22470	Mr Flintwinch	320	‘ What have you been dreaming of ? Wake up , wake up ! What ’s the matter ? ’

22509	22560	22562	22563	Mr Flintwinch	320	‘ Why , Affery , woman -- Affery ! You have been getting out of bed in your sleep , my dear ! I come up , after having fallen asleep myself , below , and find you in your wrapper here , with the nightmare . Affery , woman , ’
22574	22615	22562	22563	Mr Flintwinch	320	‘ if you ever have a dream of this sort again , it ’ll be a sign of your being in want of physic . And I ’ll give you such a dose , old woman -- such a dose ! ’
22693	22703	22704	22704	She	313	‘ Are you any better this morning , mother ? ’
22729	22755	22706	22706	her	313	‘ I shall never be better any more . It is well for me , Arthur , that I know it and can bear it . ’
22855	22873	22809	22809	She	313	‘ Shall I speak of our affairs , mother ? Are you inclined to enter upon business ? ’
22874	22911	22941	22941	her	313	‘ Am I inclined , Arthur ? Rather , are you ? Your father has been dead a year and more . I have been at your disposal , and waiting your pleasure , ever since . ’
22912	22938	22939	22939	She	313	‘ There was much to arrange before I could leave ; and when I did leave , I travelled a little for rest and relief . ’
22956	22962	22963	22963	She	313	‘ For rest and relief . ’
22998	23046	22976	22976	her	313	‘ Besides , mother , you being sole executrix , and having the direction and management of the estate , there remained little business , or I might say none , that I could transact , until you had had time to arrange matters to your satisfaction . ’
23047	23054	23055	23055	she	313	‘ The accounts are made out , ’
23058	23089	23055	23055	she	313	‘ I have them here . The vouchers have all been examined and passed . You can inspect them when you like , Arthur ; now , if you please . ’
23090	23111	22976	22976	her	313	‘ It is quite enough , mother , to know that the business is completed . Shall I proceed then ? ’
23112	23116	23117	23117	she	313	‘ Why not ? ’
23125	23206	23117	23117	she	313	‘ Mother , our House has done less and less for some years past , and our dealings have been progressively on the decline . We have never shown much confidence , or invited much ; we have attached no people to us ; the track we have kept is not the track of the time ; and we have been left far behind . I need not dwell on this to you , mother . You know it necessarily . ’
23207	23214	23215	23215	she	313	‘ I know what you mean , ’

23238	23308	23235	23235	her	313	‘ is an instance of what I say . In my father ’s earlier time , and in his uncle ’s time before him , it was a place of business -- really a place of business , and business resort . Now , it is a mere anomaly and incongruity here , out of date and out of purpose . All our consignments have long been made to Rovinghams ’

Woe to the defaulter whose appeal lay to the tribunal where those severe eyes presided . Great need had the rigid woman of her mystical religion , veiled in gloom and darkness , with lightnings of cursing , vengeance , and destruction , flashing through the sable clouds . Forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors , was a prayer too poor in spirit for her . Smite Thou my debtors , Lord , wither them , crush them ; do Thou as I would do , and Thou shalt have my worship : this was the impious tower of stone she built up to scale Heaven . ‘

24768	24798	24764	24764	you	953	’ He stopped in the hope that she would speak . But her grey hair was not more immovable in its two folds , than were her firm lips . ‘
24927	25008	25046	25046	he	320	’ There was a bell - rope hanging on the panelled wall , some two or three yards from the cabinet . By a swift and sudden action of her foot , she drove her wheeled chair rapidly back to it and pulled it violently -- still holding her arm up in its shield - like posture , as if he were striking at her , and she warding off the blow . A girl came hurrying in , frightened . ‘
25013	25031	25010	25010	Flintwinch	320	’ In a moment the girl had withdrawn , and the old man stood within the door . ‘
25035	25045	25046	25046	he	320	’re hammer and tongs , already , you two ? ’
25054	25068	25046	25046	he	320	‘ I thought you would be . I was pretty sure of it . ’
25069	25072	25074	25075	the mother	1250	‘ Flintwinch ! ’
25077	25087	25074	25075	the mother	1250	‘ look at my son . Look at him ! ’
25088	25099	25101	25101	Flintwinch	320	‘ Well , I _ am _ looking at him , ’
25129	25227	25117	25117	she	1250	‘ In the very hour of his return almost -- before the shoe upon his foot is dry -- he asperses his father ’s memory to his mother ! Asks his mother to become , with him , a spy upon his father ’s transactions through a lifetime ! Has misgivings that the goods of this world which we have painfully got together early and late , with wear and tear and toil and self - denial , are so much plunder ; and asks to whom they shall be given up , as reparation and restitution ! ’
25264	25267	25269	25269	she	1250	‘ Reparation ! ’
25271	25356	25269	25269	she	1250	‘ Yes , truly ! It is easy for him to talk of reparation , fresh from journeying and junketing in foreign lands , and living a life of vanity and pleasure . But let him look at me , in prison , and in bonds here . I endure without murmuring , because it is appointed that I shall so make reparation for my sins . Reparation ! Is there none in this room ? Has there been none here this fifteen years ? ’
25423	25431	25432	25434	The old man	1211	‘ Flintwinch , give me that book ! ’
25469	25630	25665	25665	she	1367	‘ In the days of old , Arthur , treated of in this commentary , there were pious men , beloved of the Lord , who would have cursed their sons for less than this : who would have sent them forth , and sent whole nations forth , if such had supported them , to be avoided of God and man , and perish , down to the baby at the breast . But I only tell you that if you ever renew that theme with me , I will renounce you ; I will so dismiss you through that doorway , that you had better have been motherless from your cradle . I will never see or know you more . And if , after all , you were to come into this darkened room to look upon me lying dead , my body should bleed , if I could make it , when you came near me . ’

25821	25843	25812	25812	you	0	’ said Mrs Clennam , turning her face so that it was addressed for the moment to the old man only . ‘

25865	25871	25880	25880	you	0	’ the old man persisted . ‘

26036	26063	26012	26012	Arthur	304	’ He put his hands to the back of the wheeled chair , and muttering to himself , slowly wheeled his mistress back to her cabinet . ‘
26066	26074	26012	26012	Arthur	304	’ he resumed , standing behind her : ‘
26120	26121	26122	26122	He	304	’ ‘
26127	26128	26122	26122	He	304	’ ‘
26137	26159	26122	26122	He	304	’ Mrs Clennam glanced at her son , leaning against one of the windows . He observed the look and said , ‘
26173	26174	26170	26170	she	9736	’ ‘
26180	26188	26170	26170	she	9736	’ she said after a short pause , ‘
26259	26284	26285	26285	I	0	’ Jeremiah , whose eyes glistened as if they saw money , darted a sudden look at the son , which seemed to say , ‘
26304	26351	26240	26240	Jeremiah	314	’ and then told the mother that he thanked her , and that Affery thanked her , and that he would never desert her , and that Affery would never desert her . Finally , he hauled up his watch from its depths , and said , ‘
26359	27177	27178	27178	them	1388	’ and with that change of subject , which involved no change of expression or manner , rang the bell . But Mrs Clennam , resolved to treat herself with the greater rigour for having been supposed to be unacquainted with reparation , refused to eat her oysters when they were brought . They looked tempting ; eight in number , circularly set out on a white plate on a tray covered with a white napkin , flanked by a slice of buttered French roll , and a little compact glass of cool wine and water ; but she resisted all persuasions , and sent them down again -- placing the act to her credit , no doubt , in her Eternal Day - Book . This refection of oysters was not presided over by Affery , but by the girl who had appeared when the bell was rung ; the same who had been in the dimly - lighted room last night . Now that he had an opportunity of observing her , Arthur found that her diminutive figure , small features , and slight spare dress , gave her the appearance of being much younger than she was . A woman , probably of not less than two - and - twenty , she might have been passed in the street for little more than half that age . Not that her face was very youthful , for in truth there was more consideration and care in it than naturally belonged to her utmost years ; but she was so little and light , so noiseless and shy , and appeared so conscious of being out of place among the three hard elders , that she had all the manner and much of the appearance of a subdued child . In a hard way , and in an uncertain way that fluctuated between patronage and putting down , the sprinkling from a watering - pot and hydraulic pressure , Mrs Clennam showed an interest in this dependent . Even in the moment of her entrance , upon the violent ringing of the bell , when the mother shielded herself with that singular action from the son , Mrs Clennam ’s eyes had had some individual recognition in them , which seemed reserved for her . As there are degrees of hardness in the hardest metal , and shades of colour in black itself , so , even in the asperity of Mrs Clennam ’s demeanour towards all the rest of humanity and towards Little Dorrit , there was a fine gradation . Little Dorrit let herself out to do needlework . At so much a day -- or at so little -- from eight to eight , Little Dorrit was to be hired . Punctual to the moment , Little Dorrit appeared ; punctual to the moment , Little Dorrit vanished . What became of Little Dorrit between the two eights was a mystery . Another of the moral phenomena of Little Dorrit . Besides her consideration money , her daily contract included meals . She had an extraordinary repugnance to dining in company ; would never do so , if it were possible to escape . Would always plead that she had this bit of work to begin first , or that bit of work to finish first ; and would , of a certainty , scheme and plan -- not very cunningly , it would seem , for she deceived no one -- to dine alone . Successful in this , happy in carrying off her plate anywhere , to make a table of her lap , or a box , or the ground , or even as was supposed , to stand on tip - toe , dining moderately at a mantel - shelf ; the great anxiety of Little Dorrit ’s day was set at rest . It was not easy to make out Little Dorrit ’s face ; she was so retiring , plied her needle in such removed corners , and started away so scared if encountered on the stairs . But it seemed to be a pale transparent face , quick in expression , though not beautiful in feature , its soft hazel eyes excepted . A delicately bent head , a tiny form , a quick little pair of busy hands , and a shabby dress -- it must needs have been very shabby to look at all so , being so neat -- were Little Dorrit as she sat at work . For these particulars or generalities concerning Little Dorrit , Mr Arthur was indebted in the course of the day to his own eyes and to Mrs Affery ’s tongue . If Mrs Affery had had any will or way of her own , it would probably have been unfavourable to Little Dorrit . But as ‘
27917	27933	27935	27935	Jeremiah	314	‘ And do n’t you lay offences at your father ’s door , Mr Arthur , ’
27937	27956	27935	27935	Jeremiah	314	‘ once for all , do n’t do it ! Now , we have done with the subject . ’
28079	28086	28092	28092	she	1423	‘ Now , Affery , woman , ’
28097	28118	28092	28092	she	1423	‘ You had n’t made Mr Arthur ’s bed when I was up there last . Stir yourself . Bustle . ’
29030	29037	29038	29038	he	1474	‘ Do you think , sir , ’
29043	29064	29038	29038	he	1474	‘ that she will be very much shocked , if she should come to the gate to - morrow morning ? ’
29078	29084	29038	29038	he	1474	‘ em was and some of ‘
29097	29106	29107	29107	he	1474	‘ What like is she , you see ? ’
29111	29119	29107	29107	he	1474	‘ that ’s what it hinges on . ’
29120	29129	29135	29136	the turnkey	1483	‘ She is very delicate and inexperienced indeed . ’
29130	29133	29135	29136	the turnkey	1483	‘ That , ’
29138	29143	29135	29136	the turnkey	1483	‘ is agen her . ’
29144	29155	29157	29158	the debtor	1486	‘ She is so little used to go out alone , ’
29160	29182	29157	29158	the debtor	1486	‘ that I am at a loss to think how she will ever make her way here , if she walks . ’
29183	29186	29135	29136	the turnkey	1483	‘ P’raps , ’
29191	29199	29135	29136	the turnkey	1483	‘ she ’ll take a ackney coach . ’
29200	29203	29157	29158	the debtor	1486	‘ Perhaps . ’
29213	29226	29233	29234	the turnkey	1483	‘ I hope she will . She may not think of it . ’
29227	29231	29233	29234	the turnkey	1483	‘ Or p’raps , ’
29268	29286	29252	29252	he	1483	‘ p’raps she ’ll get her brother , or her sister , to come along with her . ’
29287	29295	29233	29234	the turnkey	1483	‘ She has no brother or sister . ’
29296	29306	29252	29252	he	1483	‘ Niece , nevy , cousin , serwant , young ‘
29316	29319	29321	29322	the turnkey	1483	‘ em , ’
29333	29353	29321	29322	the turnkey	1483	‘ I fear -- I hope it is not against the rules -- that she will bring the children . ’
29354	29358	29360	29361	the turnkey	1483	‘ The children ? ’
29363	29385	29386	29386	children	1208	‘ And the rules ? Why , lord set you up like a corner pin , we ’ve a reg’lar playground o ’
29395	29404	29410	29411	the debtor	1486	‘ em . How many a you got ? ’
29405	29408	29410	29411	the debtor	1486	‘ Two , ’
29436	29441	29442	29442	he	1483	‘ And you another , ’
29447	29511	29442	29442	he	1483	‘ which makes three on you . And your wife another , I ’ll lay a crown . Which makes four on you . And another coming , I ’ll lay half - a - crown . Which’ll make five on you . And I ’ll go another seven and sixpence to name which is the helplessest , the unborn baby or you ! ’
29546	29556	29557	29558	the turnkey	1483	‘ Got a room now ; have n’t you ? ’
29568	29579	29557	29558	the turnkey	1483	‘ Yes , I have got a very good room . ’
29580	29590	29592	29593	the turnkey	1483	‘ Any little sticks a coming to furnish it ? ’
29595	29614	29592	29593	the turnkey	1483	‘ I expect a few necessary articles of furniture to be delivered by the carrier , this afternoon . ’
29615	29619	29557	29558	the turnkey	1483	‘ Missis and little ‘
29628	29633	29557	29558	the turnkey	1483	’ asked the turnkey . ‘
29655	29656	29592	29593	the turnkey	1483	’ ‘
29668	29863	29592	29593	the turnkey	1483	’ replied the turnkey . And he followed him again with his eyes , and nodded his head seven times when he was gone . The affairs of this debtor were perplexed by a partnership , of which he knew no more than that he had invested money in it ; by legal matters of assignment and settlement , conveyance here and conveyance there , suspicion of unlawful preference of creditors in this direction , and of mysterious spiriting away of property in that ; and as nobody on the face of the earth could be more incapable of explaining any single item in the heap of confusion than the debtor himself , nothing comprehensible could be made of his case . To question him in detail , and endeavour to reconcile his answers ; to closet him with accountants and sharp practitioners , learned in the wiles of insolvency and bankruptcy ; was only to put the case out at compound interest and incomprehensibility . The irresolute fingers fluttered more and more ineffectually about the trembling lip on every such occasion , and the sharpest practitioners gave him up as a hopeless job . ‘
29866	29871	29592	29593	the turnkey	1483	’ said the turnkey , ‘
29891	29924	29592	29593	the turnkey	1483	’ He had been there five or six months , when he came running to this turnkey one forenoon to tell him , breathless and pale , that his wife was ill . ‘
29934	29939	29940	29940	We	1509	’ said the turnkey . ‘
29943	29947	29940	29940	We	1509	’ he returned , ‘
29978	29979	29974	29974	I	0	’ ‘
29994	30006	29974	29974	I	0	’ responded the practical turnkey , taking him by the elbow , ‘
30013	30079	29963	29963	I	0	’ The turnkey conducted him -- trembling from head to foot , and constantly crying under his breath , What was he to do ! while his irresolute fingers bedabbled the tears upon his face -- up one of the common staircases in the prison to a door on the garret story . Upon which door the turnkey knocked with the handle of his key . ‘
30083	30135	30136	30136	Doctor	1511	’ cried a voice inside . The turnkey , opening the door , disclosed in a wretched , ill - smelling little room , two hoarse , puffy , red - faced personages seated at a rickety table , playing at all - fours , smoking pipes , and drinking brandy . ‘
30138	30143	30136	30136	Doctor	1511	’ said the turnkey , ‘
30162	30279	30280	30280	Childbed	327	’ The doctor ’s friend was in the positive degree of hoarseness , puffiness , red - facedness , all - fours , tobacco , dirt , and brandy ; the doctor in the comparative -- hoarser , puffier , more red - faced , more all - fourey , tobaccoer , dirtier , and brandier . The doctor was amazingly shabby , in a torn and darned rough - weather sea - jacket , out at elbows and eminently short of buttons ( he had been in his time the experienced surgeon carried by a passenger ship ) , the dirtiest white trousers conceivable by mortal man , carpet slippers , and no visible linen . ‘
30282	30287	30288	30288	I	0	’ said the doctor . ‘
30289	30293	30296	30297	the doctor	10108	’m the boy ! ’
30641	30654	30656	30657	Mrs Bangham	328	‘ The flies trouble you , do n’t they , my dear ? ’
30659	30705	30656	30657	Mrs Bangham	328	‘ But p’raps they ’ll take your mind off of it , and do you good . What between the buryin ground , the grocer ’s , the waggon - stables , and the paunch trade , the Marshalsea flies gets very large . P’raps they ’re
30746	30828	30830	30831	Mrs Bangham	328	’re better , and you know it , do n’t you ? Yes . That ’s right ! And to think of a sweet little cherub being born inside the lock ! Now ai n’t it pretty , ai n’t _ that _ something to carry you through it pleasant ? Why , we ai n’t had such a thing happen here , my dear , not for I could n’t name the time when . And you a crying too ? ’
30841	30875	30877	30878	Mrs Bangham	328	‘ You ! Making yourself so famous ! With the flies a falling into the gallipots by fifties ! And everything a going on so well ! And here if there ai n’t , ’
30884	30911	30877	30878	Mrs Bangham	328	‘ if there ai n’t your dear gentleman along with Dr Haggage ! And now indeed we _ are _ complete , I _ think _ ! ’
30939	30964	30967	30967	he	10108	‘ We are as right as we can be , Mrs Bangham , and we shall come out of this like a house afire ; ’
31032	31036	31038	31039	the doctor	10108	‘ Mrs Bangham , ’
31049	31066	31038	31039	the doctor	10108	‘ go outside and fetch a little brandy , or we shall have you giving in . ’
31067	31079	31081	31082	Mrs Bangham	328	‘ Thank you , sir . But none on my accounts , ’
31084	31088	31090	31091	the doctor	10108	‘ Mrs Bangham , ’
31093	31132	31090	31091	the doctor	10108	‘ I am in professional attendance on this lady , and do n’t choose to allow any discussion on your part . Go outside and fetch a little brandy , or I foresee that you ’ll break down . ’
31133	31135	31090	31091	the doctor	10108	‘ You ’re
31142	31149	31140	31140	sir	933	’ said Mrs Bangham , rising . ‘
31178	31179	31180	31181	Mrs Bangham	328	’ ‘
31183	31188	31180	31181	Mrs Bangham	328	’ returned the doctor , ‘
31240	31307	31308	31312	A very nice little girl	1555	’ Mrs Bangham submitted ; and the doctor , having administered her potion , took his own . He repeated the treatment every hour , being very determined with Mrs Bangham . Three or four hours passed ; the flies fell into the traps by hundreds ; and at length one little life , hardly stronger than theirs , appeared among the multitude of lesser deaths . ‘
31315	31320	31308	31312	A very nice little girl	1555	’ said the doctor ; ‘
31334	31362	31333	31333	You	328	’re looking queer ! You be off , ma’am , this minute , and fetch a little more brandy , or we shall have you in hysterics . ’
31437	31441	31443	31444	the doctor	10108	‘ Thank you , ’
31446	31460	31443	31444	the doctor	10108	‘ thank you . Your good lady is quite composed . Doing charmingly . ’
31461	31473	31475	31476	the debtor	1486	‘ I am very happy and very thankful to know it , ’
31478	31486	31475	31476	the debtor	1486	‘ though I little thought once , that-- ’
31487	31502	31504	31505	the doctor	10108	‘ That a child would be born to you in a place like this ? ’
31507	31730	31504	31505	the doctor	10108	‘ Bah , bah , sir , what does it signify ? A little more elbow - room is all we want here . We are quiet here ; we do n’t get badgered here ; there ’s no knocker here , sir , to be hammered at by creditors and bring a man ’s heart into his mouth . Nobody comes here to ask if a man ’s at home , and to say he ’ll stand on the door mat till he is . Nobody writes threatening letters about money to this place . It ’s freedom , sir , it ’s freedom ! I have had to - day ’s practice at home and abroad , on a march , and aboard ship , and I ’ll tell you this : I do n’t know that I have ever pursued it under such quiet circumstances as here this day . Elsewhere , people are restless , worried , hurried about , anxious respecting one thing , anxious respecting another . Nothing of the kind here , sir . We have done all that -- we know the worst of it ; we have got to the bottom , we ca n’t fall , and what have we found ? Peace . That ’s the word for it . Peace . ’
32016	32020	32002	32002	everybody	1574	‘ Why , I ’m
32026	32036	32002	32002	everybody	1574	’ said his friend the turnkey , one day . ‘
32061	32088	32093	32093	him	1579	’ The turnkey really was proud of him . He would mention him in laudatory terms to new - comers , when his back was turned . ‘
32095	32100	32089	32089	You	1578	’ he would say , ‘
32110	32119	32089	32089	You	1578	’ New - comer would probably answer Yes . ‘
32262	32558	32560	32560	him	1594	’ When his youngest child was eight years old , his wife , who had long been languishing away -- of her own inherent weakness , not that she retained any greater sensitiveness as to her place of abode than he did -- went upon a visit to a poor friend and old nurse in the country , and died there . He remained shut up in his room for a fortnight afterwards ; and an attorney ’s clerk , who was going through the Insolvent Court , engrossed an address of condolence to him , which looked like a Lease , and which all the prisoners signed . When he appeared again he was greyer ( he had soon begun to turn grey ) ; and the turnkey noticed that his hands went often to his trembling lips again , as they had used to do when he first came in . But he got pretty well over it in a month or two ; and in the meantime the children played about the yard as regularly as ever , but in black . Then Mrs Bangham , long popular medium of communication with the outer world , began to be infirm , and to be found oftener than usual comatose on pavements , with her basket of purchases spilt , and the change of her clients ninepence short . His son began to supersede Mrs Bangham , and to execute commissions in a knowing manner , and to be of the prison prisonous , of the streets streety . Time went on , and the turnkey began to fail . His chest swelled , and his legs got weak , and he was short of breath . The well - worn wooden stool was ‘
32562	32610	32560	32560	him	1594	’ he complained . He sat in an arm - chair with a cushion , and sometimes wheezed so , for minutes together , that he could n’t turn the key . When he was overpowered by these fits , the debtor often turned it for him . ‘
32615	32642	32644	32646	the oldest inhabitants	1596	’ said the turnkey , one snowy winter ’s night when the lodge , with a bright fire in it , was pretty full of company , ‘
32667	32685	32686	32687	The turnkey	1483	’m off the lock for good and all , you ’ll be the Father of the Marshalsea . ’
33038	33048	33049	33049	He	0	‘ With the compliments of a collegian taking leave . ’
33204	33207	33208	33208	He	1625	‘ Hi ! ’
33214	33216	33217	33217	he	1625	’Me ? ’
33254	33255	33237	33237	he	1625	’ ‘
33262	33269	33256	33256	I	0	’ the collegian would usually return , ‘
33277	33278	33279	33279	My	0	’ ‘
33283	33288	33289	33289	he	1435	’ he would rejoin , ‘
33296	33399	33289	33289	he	1435	’ But , to the last , the irresolute hand of old would remain in the pocket into which he had slipped the money during two or three turns about the yard , lest the transaction should be too conspicuous to the general body of collegians . One afternoon he had been doing the honours of the place to a rather large party of collegians , who happened to be going out , when , as he was coming back , he encountered one from the poor side who had been taken in execution for a small sum a week before , had ‘
33401	33442	33289	33289	he	1435	’ in the course of that afternoon , and was going out too . The man was a mere Plasterer in his working dress ; had his wife with him , and a bundle ; and was in high spirits . ‘
33449	33455	33447	33447	sir	933	’ he said in passing . ‘
33459	33485	33486	33486	I	0	’ benignantly returned the Father of the Marshalsea . They were pretty far divided , going their several ways , when the Plasterer called out , ‘
33489	33496	33486	33486	I	0	’ and came back to him . ‘
33502	33517	33486	33486	I	0	’ said the Plasterer , putting a little pile of halfpence in his hand , ‘
33524	33590	33486	33486	I	0	’ The Father of the Marshalsea had never been offered tribute in copper yet . His children often had , and with his perfect acquiescence it had gone into the common purse to buy meat that he had eaten , and drink that he had drunk ; but fustian splashed with white lime , bestowing halfpence on him , front to front , was new . ‘
33595	33656	33659	33659	you	933	’ he said to the man , and feebly burst into tears . The Plasterer turned him towards the wall , that his face might not be seen ; and the action was so delicate , and the man was so penetrated with repentance , and asked pardon so honestly , that he could make him no less acknowledgment than , ‘
33668	33669	33659	33659	you	933	’ ‘
33676	33681	33682	33682	I	0	’ urged the Plasterer , ‘
33696	33703	33659	33659	you	933	‘ em do , I fancy . ’
33704	33710	33711	33711	he	0	‘ What would you do ? ’
33714	33729	33711	33711	he	0	‘ I ’d come back to see you , after I was let out . ’
33730	33737	33739	33740	the other	9761	‘ Give me the money again , ’
33744	33770	33739	33740	the other	9761	‘ and I ’ll keep it , and never spend it . Thank you for it , thank you ! I shall see you again ? ’
33771	33780	33781	33781	They	1632	‘ If I live a week you shall . ’
33908	33912	33914	33915	the turnkey	1483	‘ By rights , ’
33924	33932	33914	33915	the turnkey	1483	‘ I ought to be her godfather . ’
33946	33958	33933	33934	The debtor	1486	‘ Perhaps you would n’t object to really being her godfather ? ’
33959	33969	33971	33972	the turnkey	1483	‘ Oh ! _ I _ do n’t object , ’
33974	33980	33971	33972	the turnkey	1483	‘ if you do n’t . ’
34040	34044	34032	34032	he	1483	‘ like a good ‘
34047	34279	34032	34032	he	1483	’ This invested the turnkey with a new proprietary share in the child , over and above his former official one . When she began to walk and talk , he became fond of her ; bought a little arm - chair and stood it by the high fender of the lodge fire - place ; liked to have her company when he was on the lock ; and used to bribe her with cheap toys to come and talk to him . The child , for her part , soon grew so fond of the turnkey that she would come climbing up the lodge - steps of her own accord at all hours of the day . When she fell asleep in the little armchair by the high fender , the turnkey would cover her with his pocket - handkerchief ; and when she sat in it dressing and undressing a doll which soon came to be unlike dolls on the other side of the lock , and to bear a horrible family resemblance to Mrs Bangham -- he would contemplate her from the top of his stool with exceeding gentleness . Witnessing these things , the collegians would express an opinion that the turnkey , who was a bachelor , had been cut out by nature for a family man . But the turnkey thanked them , and said , ‘
34296	34568	34290	34291	other people	1651	’ At what period of her early life the little creature began to perceive that it was not the habit of all the world to live locked up in narrow yards surrounded by high walls with spikes at the top , would be a difficult question to settle . But she was a very , very little creature indeed , when she had somehow gained the knowledge that her clasp of her father ’s hand was to be always loosened at the door which the great key opened ; and that while her own light steps were free to pass beyond it , his feet must never cross that line . A pitiful and plaintive look , with which she had begun to regard him when she was still extremely young , was perhaps a part of this discovery . With a pitiful and plaintive look for everything , indeed , but with something in it for only him that was like protection , this Child of the Marshalsea and the child of the Father of the Marshalsea , sat by her friend the turnkey in the lodge , kept the family room , or wandered about the prison - yard , for the first eight years of her life . With a pitiful and plaintive look for her wayward sister ; for her idle brother ; for the high blank walls ; for the faded crowd they shut in ; for the games of the prison children as they whooped and ran , and played at hide - and - seek , and made the iron bars of the inner gateway ‘
34571	34631	34290	34291	other people	1651	’ Wistful and wondering , she would sit in summer weather by the high fender in the lodge , looking up at the sky through the barred window , until , when she turned her eyes away , bars of light would arise between her and her friend , and she would see him through a grating , too . ‘
34637	34647	34290	34291	other people	1651	’ the turnkey said once , after watching her , ‘
34652	34653	34290	34291	other people	1651	’ ‘
34658	34662	34290	34291	other people	1651	’ she inquired . ‘
34673	34686	34290	34291	other people	1651	’ said the turnkey , with a vague flourish of his key . ‘
34691	34692	34290	34291	other people	1651	’ ‘
34706	34712	34290	34291	other people	1651	’ The turnkey was discomfited . ‘
34715	34719	34290	34291	other people	1651	’ he said . ‘
34724	34725	34290	34291	other people	1651	’ ‘
34733	34747	34731	34731	Bob	339	’ She called him Bob , by his own particular request and instruction . ‘
34782	34783	34792	34792	Bob	339	’ ‘
34794	34795	34796	34796	Prime	340	’ ‘
34798	34803	34796	34796	Prime	340	’ said the turnkey . ‘
34809	34810	34811	34811	Hem	341	’ ‘
34813	34818	34811	34811	Hem	341	’ coughed the turnkey . ‘
34828	34829	34822	34822	he	1100	’ ‘
34839	34840	34831	34831	he	1100	’ ‘
34846	34851	34831	34831	he	1100	’ said the turnkey . ‘
34858	34869	34853	34856	any of the people	1662	’ she asked , glancing at the listless crowd within . ‘
34880	35095	34872	34872	you	339	’ At this difficult point of the conversation Bob gave in , and changed the subject to hard - bake : always his last resource when he found his little friend getting him into a political , social , or theological corner . But this was the origin of a series of Sunday excursions that these two curious companions made together . They used to issue from the lodge on alternate Sunday afternoons with great gravity , bound for some meadows or green lanes that had been elaborately appointed by the turnkey in the course of the week ; and there she picked grass and flowers to bring home , while he smoked his pipe . Afterwards , there were tea - gardens , shrimps , ale , and other delicacies ; and then they would come back hand in hand , unless she was more than usually tired , and had fallen asleep on his shoulder . In those early days , the turnkey first began profoundly to consider a question which cost him so much mental labour , that it remained undetermined on the day of his death . He decided to will and bequeath his little property of savings to his godchild , and the point arose how could it be so ‘
35098	35126	34872	34872	you	339	’ as that only she should have the benefit of it ? His experience on the lock gave him such an acute perception of the enormous difficulty of ‘
35129	35176	34872	34872	you	339	’ money with any approach to tightness , and contrariwise of the remarkable ease with which it got loose , that through a series of years he regularly propounded this knotty point to every new insolvent agent and other professional gentleman who passed in and out . ‘
35179	35197	34872	34872	you	339	’ he would say , stating the case with his key on the professional gentleman ’s waistcoat ; ‘
35240	35241	35246	35246	herself	1666	’ ‘
35248	35256	35246	35246	herself	1666	’ the professional gentleman would complacently answer . ‘
35261	35266	35268	35268	she	1666	’ quoth the turnkey . ‘
35304	35305	35268	35268	she	1666	’ ‘
35326	35333	35352	35352	they	1674	’ would be the professional answer . ‘
35338	35343	35352	35352	they	1674	’ said the turnkey . ‘
35367	36113	35359	35359	your	1668	’ The deepest character whom the turnkey sounded , was unable to produce his law for tying such a knot as that . So , the turnkey thought about it all his life , and died intestate after all . But that was long afterwards , when his god - daughter was past sixteen . The first half of that space of her life was only just accomplished , when her pitiful and plaintive look saw her father a widower . From that time the protection that her wondering eyes had expressed towards him , became embodied in action , and the Child of the Marshalsea took upon herself a new relation towards the Father . At first , such a baby could do little more than sit with him , deserting her livelier place by the high fender , and quietly watching him . But this made her so far necessary to him that he became accustomed to her , and began to be sensible of missing her when she was not there . Through this little gate , she passed out of childhood into the care - laden world . What her pitiful look saw , at that early time , in her father , in her sister , in her brother , in the jail ; how much , or how little of the wretched truth it pleased God to make visible to her ; lies hidden with many mysteries . It is enough that she was inspired to be something which was not what the rest were , and to be that something , different and laborious , for the sake of the rest . Inspired ? Yes . Shall we speak of the inspiration of a poet or a priest , and not of the heart impelled by love and self - devotion to the lowliest work in the lowliest way of life ! With no earthly friend to help her , or so much as to see her , but the one so strangely assorted ; with no knowledge even of the common daily tone and habits of the common members of the free community who are not shut up in prisons ; born and bred in a social condition , false even with a reference to the falsest condition outside the walls ; drinking from infancy of a well whose waters had their own peculiar stain , their own unwholesome and unnatural taste ; the Child of the Marshalsea began her womanly life . No matter through what mistakes and discouragements , what ridicule ( not unkindly meant , but deeply felt ) of her youth and little figure , what humble consciousness of her own babyhood and want of strength , even in the matter of lifting and carrying ; through how much weariness and hopelessness , and how many secret tears ; she drudged on , until recognised as useful , even indispensable . That time came . She took the place of eldest of the three , in all things but precedence ; was the head of the fallen family ; and bore , in her own heart , its anxieties and shames . At thirteen , she could read and keep accounts , that is , could put down in words and figures how much the bare necessaries that they wanted would cost , and how much less they had to buy them with . She had been , by snatches of a few weeks at a time , to an evening school outside , and got her sister and brother sent to day - schools by desultory starts , during three or four years . There was no instruction for any of them at home ; but she knew well -- no one better -- that a man so broken as to be the Father of the Marshalsea , could be no father to his own children . To these scanty means of improvement , she added another of her own contriving . Once , among the heterogeneous crowd of inmates there appeared a dancing - master . Her sister had a great desire to learn the dancing - master ’s art , and seemed to have a taste that way . At thirteen years old , the Child of the Marshalsea presented herself to the dancing - master , with a little bag in her hand , and preferred her humble petition . ‘
36125	36126	36118	36118	I	0	’ ‘
36138	36153	36156	36156	sir	933	’ said the dancing - master , surveying the small figure and uplifted face . ‘
36158	36159	36156	36156	sir	933	’ ‘
36168	36175	36163	36163	I	0	’ said the dancing - master . ‘
36185	36195	36180	36180	sir	933	’ anxiously undrawing the strings of the little bag ; ‘
36215	36216	36217	36218	My child	1683	’ ‘
36227	36478	36220	36220	I	0	’ said the dancing - master , shutting up the bag . He was as good - natured a dancing - master as ever danced to the Insolvent Court , and he kept his word . The sister was so apt a pupil , and the dancing - master had such abundant leisure to bestow upon her ( for it took him a matter of ten weeks to set to his creditors , lead off , turn the Commissioners , and right and left back to his professional pursuits ) , that wonderful progress was made . Indeed the dancing - master was so proud of it , and so wishful to display it before he left to a few select friends among the collegians , that at six o’clock on a certain fine morning , a minuet de la cour came off in the yard -- the college - rooms being of too confined proportions for the purpose -- in which so much ground was covered , and the steps were so conscientiously executed , that the dancing - master , having to play the kit besides , was thoroughly blown . The success of this beginning , which led to the dancing - master ’s continuing his instruction after his release , emboldened the poor child to try again . She watched and waited months for a seamstress . In the fulness of time a milliner came in , and to her she repaired on her own behalf . ‘
36486	36508	36479	36479	I	0	’ she said , looking timidly round the door of the milliner , whom she found in tears and in bed : ‘
36515	36552	36510	36510	I	0	’ Everybody seemed to hear of her as soon as they arrived ; for the milliner sat up in bed , drying her eyes , and said , just as the dancing - master had said : ‘
36565	36566	36569	36569	ma’am	10131	’ ‘
36571	36572	36569	36569	ma’am	10131	’ ‘
36584	36593	36576	36576	I	0	’ said the milliner , shaking her head . ‘
36612	36613	36604	36604	I	0	’ ‘
36620	36625	36616	36616	you	10131	’ returned the milliner , ‘
36639	36640	36616	36616	you	10131	’ ‘
36658	36665	36667	36667	I	0	’ she returned in all simplicity ; ‘
36675	36676	36677	36677	I	0	’ ‘
36688	36693	36685	36685	you	10131	’ the milliner objected . ‘
36704	36705	36702	36702	ma’am	10131	’ ‘
36718	36723	36715	36715	you	10131	’ the milliner objected . ‘
36735	36912	36729	36729	I	0	’ returned the Child of the Marshalsea ; and so began to sob over that unfortunate defect of hers , which came so often in her way . The milliner -- who was not morose or hard - hearted , only newly insolvent -- was touched , took her in hand with goodwill , found her the most patient and earnest of pupils , and made her a cunning work - woman in course of time . In course of time , and in the very self - same course of time , the Father of the Marshalsea gradually developed a new flower of character . The more Fatherly he grew as to the Marshalsea , and the more dependent he became on the contributions of his changing family , the greater stand he made by his forlorn gentility . With the same hand that he pocketed a collegian ’s half - crown half an hour ago , he would wipe away the tears that streamed over his cheeks if any reference were made to his daughters ’
37183	37218	37180	37181	the Father	875	‘ Fanny is not going to live with us just now , father . She will be here a good deal in the day , but she is going to live outside with uncle . ’
37219	37226	37307	37307	his	1716	‘ You surprise me . Why ? ’
37227	37247	37180	37181	the Father	875	‘ I think uncle wants a companion , father . He should be attended to , and looked after . ’
37248	37296	37180	37181	the Father	875	‘ A companion ? He passes much of his time here . And you attend to him and look after him , Amy , a great deal more than ever your sister will . You all go out so much ; you all go out so much . ’
37322	37385	37313	37313	herself	331	‘ But we are always glad to come home , father ; now , are we not ? And as to Fanny , perhaps besides keeping uncle company and taking care of him , it may be as well for her not quite to live here , always . She was not born here as I was , you know , father . ’
37386	37455	37491	37491	her	1717	‘ Well , Amy , well . I do n’t quite follow you , but it ’s natural I suppose that Fanny should prefer to be outside , and even that you often should , too . So , you and Fanny and your uncle , my dear , shall have your own way . Good , good . I ’ll not meddle ; do n’t mind me . ’
37549	37553	37555	37555	she	1717	‘ Dear Bob , ’
37557	37566	37555	37555	she	1717	‘ what is to become of poor Tip ? ’
37650	37656	37658	37659	the turnkey	1483	‘ Well , my dear , ’
37661	37680	37658	37659	the turnkey	1483	‘ something ought to be done with him . Suppose I try and get him into the law ? ’
37681	37692	37693	37694	The turnkey	1483	‘ That would be so good of you , Bob ! ’
37817	37823	37825	37832	the poor little anxious Child of the Marshalsea	1738	‘ Not going back again ? ’
37849	37857	37859	37859	Tip	344	‘ I am so tired of it , ’
37861	37868	37859	37859	Tip	344	‘ that I have cut it . ’
38173	38199	38150	38150	her	1756	‘ God bless you , dear Tip . Do n’t be too proud to come and see us , when you have made your fortune . ’
38200	38204	38206	38206	Tip	344	‘ All right ! ’
38309	38318	38298	38298	he	344	‘ Amy , I have got a situation . ’
38319	38328	38265	38265	her	1756	‘ Have you really and truly , Tip ? ’
38329	38351	38265	38265	her	1756	‘ All right . I shall do now . You need n’t look anxious about me any more , old girl . ’
38352	38359	38298	38298	he	344	‘ What is it , Tip ? ’
38360	38369	38265	38265	her	1756	‘ Why , you know Slingo by sight ? ’
38370	38379	38265	38265	her	1756	‘ Not the man they call the dealer ? ’
38380	38403	38265	38265	her	1756	‘ That ’s the chap . He ’ll be out on Monday , and he ’s going to give me a berth . ’
38404	38414	38265	38265	her	1756	‘ What is he a dealer in , Tip ? ’
38415	38428	38265	38265	her	1756	‘ Horses . All right ! I shall do now , Amy . ’
38552	38572	38539	38539	He	1761	‘ I am afraid , Amy , you ’ll be vexed this time . Upon my life I am ! ’
38573	38591	38539	38539	He	1761	‘ I am very sorry to hear you say so , Tip . Have you come back ? ’
38592	38597	38539	38539	He	1761	‘ Why -- yes . ’
38598	38627	38539	38539	He	1761	‘ Not expecting this time that what you had found would answer very well , I am less surprised and sorry than I might have been , Tip . ’
38628	38640	38539	38539	He	1761	‘ Ah ! But that ’s not the worst of it . ’
38641	38648	38539	38539	He	1761	‘ Not the worst of it ? ’

38713	38732	38539	38539	He	1761	‘ Oh ! Do n’t say you are a prisoner , Tip ! Do n’t , do n’t ! ’
38733	38744	38745	38745	he	1763	‘ Well , I do n’t want to say it , ’
38752	38779	38745	38745	he	1763	‘ but if you ca n’t understand me without my saying it , what am I to do ? I am in for forty pound odd . ’
39606	39611	39613	39613	Arthur	304	‘ Pray , sir , ’
39619	39625	39613	39613	Arthur	304	‘ what is this place ? ’
39626	39632	39634	39636	the old man	1211	‘ Ay ! This place ? ’
39657	39665	39639	39639	his	1211	‘ This is the Marshalsea , sir . ’
39666	39669	39698	39699	the debtors	776	‘ The debtors ’

39676	39697	39698	39699	the debtors	776	’ said the old man , with the air of deeming it not quite necessary to insist upon that designation , ‘
39700	39703	39704	39704	He	1211	’ prison . ’
39713	39719	39721	39721	Arthur	304	‘ I beg your pardon , ’
39728	39747	39721	39721	Arthur	304	‘ but will you allow me to ask you another question ? Can any one go in here ? ’
39748	39757	39759	39761	the old man	1211	‘ Any one can _ go in _ , ’
39772	39784	39759	39761	the old man	1211	‘ but it is not every one who can go out . ’
39785	39798	39769	39769	his	1211	‘ Pardon me once more . Are you familiar with the place ? ’
39799	39802	39804	39806	the old man	1211	‘ Sir , ’
39830	39834	39769	39769	his	1211	‘ I am . ’
39835	39864	39873	39875	the old man	1211	‘ I beg you to excuse me . I am not impertinently curious , but have a good object . Do you know the name of Dorrit here ? ’
39865	39871	39873	39875	the old man	1211	‘ My name , sir , ’
39879	39883	39873	39875	the old man	1211	‘ is Dorrit . ’
39892	40015	40016	40018	The old man	1211	‘ Grant me the favour of half - a - dozen words . I was wholly unprepared for your announcement , and hope that assurance is my sufficient apology for having taken the liberty of addressing you . I have recently come home to England after a long absence . I have seen at my mother’s -- Mrs Clennam in the city -- a young woman working at her needle , whom I have only heard addressed or spoken of as Little Dorrit . I have felt sincerely interested in her , and have had a great desire to know something more about her . I saw her , not a minute before you came up , pass in at that door . ’
40024	40032	40033	40033	he	1211	‘ Are you a sailor , sir ? ’
40052	40075	40036	40036	He	1211	‘ Not a sailor ? I judged from your sunburnt face that you might be . Are you in earnest , sir ? ’
40076	40099	40113	40122	the other , who had a weak and quavering voice	1808	‘ I do assure you that I am , and do entreat you to believe that I am , in plain earnest . ’
40100	40111	40113	40122	the other , who had a weak and quavering voice	1808	‘ I know very little of the world , sir , ’
40124	40235	40236	40236	He	1809	‘ I am merely passing on , like the shadow over the sun - dial . It would be worth no man ’s while to mislead me ; it would really be too easy -- too poor a success , to yield any satisfaction . The young woman whom you saw go in here is my brother ’s child . My brother is William Dorrit ; I am Frederick . You say you have seen her at your mother ’s ( I know your mother befriends her ) , you have felt an interest in her , and you wish to know what she does here . Come and see . ’
40246	40250	40252	40259	the old man , pausing on the step	1810	‘ My brother , ’
40266	40351	40252	40259	the old man , pausing on the step	1810	‘ has been here many years ; and much that happens even among ourselves , out of doors , is kept from him for reasons that I need n’t enter upon now . Be so good as to say nothing of my niece ’s working at her needle . Be so good as to say nothing that goes beyond what is said among us . If you keep within our bounds , you can not well be wrong . Now ! Come and see . ’
40545	40563	40564	40564	He	1211	‘ They are rather dark , sir , but you will not find anything in the way . ’
40744	40750	40752	40754	the uncle--‘Mr Clennam	304	‘ I found this gentleman , ’
40799	40800	40797	40797	sir	933	’ ‘
40804	40814	40795	40795	William	347	’ said Arthur , very doubtful what to say , ‘
40835	40836	40837	40838	Mr Clennam	304	’ ‘
40840	40869	40837	40838	Mr Clennam	304	’ returned the other , rising , taking his cap off in the flat of his hand , and so holding it , ready to put on again , ‘
40881	40887	40888	40888	Frederick	319	’ with a low bow . ‘
40900	40945	40897	40898	Mr Clennam	304	’ He put his black cap on again as he had taken it off , and resumed his own seat . There was a wonderful air of benignity and patronage in his manner . These were the ceremonies with which he received the collegians . ‘
40984	40985	40986	40986	I	0	’ ‘
40993	41002	40989	40989	I	0	’ said Arthur , dashing at the assertion . ‘
41079	41080	41082	41082	you	933	’ ‘
41084	41088	41082	41082	you	933	’ returned Arthur . ‘
41093	41256	41257	41257	Frederick	319	’ He felt himself quite lost in wonder at the manner of the man , and that the probability of his daughter ’s having had a reserve as to her family history , should be so far out of his mind . She filled his glass , put all the little matters on the table ready to his hand , and then sat beside him while he ate his supper . Evidently in observance of their nightly custom , she put some bread before herself , and touched his glass with her lips ; but Arthur saw she was troubled and took nothing . Her look at her father , half admiring him and proud of him , half ashamed for him , all devoted and loving , went to his inmost heart . The Father of the Marshalsea condescended towards his brother as an amiable , well - meaning man ; a private character , who had not arrived at distinction . ‘
41259	41263	41264	41264	you	319	’ said he , ‘
41287	41288	41289	41289	She	342	’ ‘

41414	41427	41356	41356	My	0	’ said Frederick , faintly lighting up with a ray of pride . ‘
41430	41438	41356	41356	My	0	’ the Father of the Marshalsea assented . ‘
41506	41507	41508	41508	I	0	’ ‘
41517	41518	41515	41515	father	1100	’ ‘
41529	41564	41565	41565	I	0	’ Frederick doubted if he had ever heard it . No one could doubt that Frederick was the last person upon earth to put such a question to , with any hope of information . ‘
41568	41573	41565	41565	I	0	’ said his brother , ‘
41623	41624	41597	41598	Mr Clennam	304	’ ‘
41628	41654	41597	41598	Mr Clennam	304	’ said Arthur , withdrawing his eyes from the delicate head beginning to droop and the pale face with a new solicitude stealing over it . ‘
41747	41780	41847	41852	This gentleman that I refer to	1869	’ To see her hand upon his arm in mute entreaty half - repressed , and her timid little shrinking figure turning away , was to see a sad , sad sight . ‘
41783	41805	41847	41852	This gentleman that I refer to	1869	’ he went on in a low , soft voice , agitated , and clearing his throat every now and then ; ‘
41887	41922	41926	41926	his	1869	’ All this time , though he had finished his supper , he was nervously going about his plate with his knife and fork , as if some of it were still before him . ‘
42128	42210	42211	42212	Mr Clennam	304	’ Arthur was in the act of saying the little he could say on such a theme , when a bell began to ring , and footsteps approached the door . A pretty girl of a far better figure and much more developed than Little Dorrit , though looking much younger in the face when the two were observed together , stopped in the doorway on seeing a stranger ; and a young man who was with her , stopped too . ‘
42286	42287	42271	42271	He	304	’ ‘
42299	42305	42297	42297	father	1100	’ said the second girl . ‘
42311	42352	42307	42307	I	0	’ said Tip . Amy opened a drawer in an old piece of furniture that was a chest of drawers above and a bedstead below , and produced two little bundles , which she handed to her brother and sister . ‘
42358	42372	42297	42297	father	1100	’ Clennam heard the sister ask in a whisper . To which Amy answered ‘
42375	42511	42297	42297	father	1100	’ He had risen now , and took the opportunity of glancing round the room . The bare walls had been coloured green , evidently by an unskilled hand , and were poorly decorated with a few prints . The window was curtained , and the floor carpeted ; and there were shelves and pegs , and other such conveniences , that had accumulated in the course of years . It was a close , confined room , poorly furnished ; and the chimney smoked to boot , or the tin screen at the top of the fireplace was superfluous ; but constant pains and care had made it neat , and even , after its kind , comfortable . All the while the bell was ringing , and the uncle was anxious to go . ‘
42520	42533	42518	42518	Fanny	342	’ he said , with his ragged clarionet case under his arm ; ‘
42542	42563	42537	42537	child	1881	’ Fanny bade her father good night , and whisked off airily . Tip had already clattered down - stairs . ‘
42569	42583	42566	42567	Mr Clennam	304	’ said the uncle , looking back as he shuffled out after them , ‘
42592	42648	42705	42706	Mr Clennam	304	’ Mr Clennam had two things to do before he followed ; one , to offer his testimonial to the Father of the Marshalsea , without giving pain to his child ; the other to say something to that child , though it were but a word , in explanation of his having come there . ‘
42652	42657	42705	42706	Mr Clennam	304	’ said the Father , ‘
42665	42679	42705	42706	Mr Clennam	304	’ She had slipped out after the rest , and they were alone . ‘
42685	42692	42705	42706	Mr Clennam	304	’ said the visitor , hurriedly . ‘
42697	42704	42705	42706	Mr Clennam	304	’ chink , chink , chink . ‘
42708	42713	42705	42706	Mr Clennam	304	’ said the Father , ‘
42719	42797	42705	42706	Mr Clennam	304	’ But his visitor had shut up his hand to stop the clinking , and had gone down - stairs with great speed . He saw no Little Dorrit on his way down , or in the yard . The last two or three stragglers were hurrying to the lodge , and he was following , when he caught sight of her in the doorway of the first house from the entrance . He turned back hastily . ‘
42802	42806	42800	42800	me	0	’ he said , ‘
42934	42952	42953	42953	You	1885	’ She was scared at first , but seemed to take courage while he spoke to her . ‘
42979	43007	42973	42973	you	1885	’ He understood the emotion with which she said it , to arise in her father ’s behalf ; and he respected it , and was silent . ‘
43079	43080	43077	43077	you	1885	’ ‘
43098	43099	43092	43092	you	1885	’ ‘
43110	43111	43092	43092	you	1885	’ ‘
43126	43127	43120	43120	she	9736	’ ‘
43214	43344	43212	43212	sir	933	’ She was so tremulous and agitated , and he was so moved by compassion for her , and by deep interest in her story as it dawned upon him , that he could scarcely tear himself away . But the stoppage of the bell , and the quiet in the prison , were a warning to depart ; and with a few hurried words of kindness he left her gliding back to her father . But he remained too late . The inner gate was locked , and the lodge closed . After a little fruitless knocking with his hand , he was standing there with the disagreeable conviction upon him that he had got to get through the night , when a voice accosted him from behind . ‘
43349	43354	43212	43212	sir	933	’ said the voice . ‘
43375	43401	43367	43367	you	1904	’ The voice was Tip ’s ; and they stood looking at one another in the prison - yard , as it began to rain . ‘
43407	43411	43402	43402	You	1904	’ observed Tip ; ‘
43421	43422	43412	43412	you	1904	’ ‘
43430	43434	43424	43424	you	1904	’ said Arthur . ‘
43440	43446	43437	43437	I	0	’ said Tip , sarcastically . ‘
43483	43484	43475	43475	I	0	’ ‘
43491	43495	43475	43475	I	0	’ asked Arthur . ‘
43502	43503	43498	43498	I	0	’ ‘
43515	43530	43504	43504	We	1908	’ said Tip , referring any difficulty to her as a matter of course . ‘
43551	43552	43553	43553	You	1904	’ ‘
43603	43632	43597	43597	I	0	’ As they passed down the yard , Arthur looked up at the window of the room he had lately left , where the light was still burning . ‘
43637	43645	43597	43597	I	0	’ said Tip , following his glance . ‘
43691	43692	43675	43675	she	1913	’ ‘
43699	43700	43701	43702	The governor	1912	’ ‘
43723	43737	43710	43710	she	1913	’ said Tip , pointing out the doorway into which she had retired . ‘
43776	44027	43762	43762	she	1913	’ This brought them to the tavern - establishment at the upper end of the prison , where the collegians had just vacated their social evening club . The apartment on the ground - floor in which it was held , was the Snuggery in question ; the presidential tribune of the chairman , the pewter - pots , glasses , pipes , tobacco - ashes , and general flavour of members , were still as that convivial institution had left them on its adjournment . The Snuggery had two of the qualities popularly held to be essential to grog for ladies , in respect that it was hot and strong ; but in the third point of analogy , requiring plenty of it , the Snuggery was defective ; being but a cooped - up apartment . The unaccustomed visitor from outside , naturally assumed everybody here to be prisoners -- landlord , waiter , barmaid , potboy , and all . Whether they were or not , did not appear ; but they all had a weedy look . The keeper of a chandler ’s shop in a front parlour , who took in gentlemen boarders , lent his assistance in making the bed . He had been a tailor in his time , and had kept a phaeton , he said . He boasted that he stood up litigiously for the interests of the college ; and he had undefined and undefinable ideas that the marshal intercepted a ‘
44030	44813	43762	43762	she	1913	’ which ought to come to the collegians . He liked to believe this , and always impressed the shadowy grievance on new - comers and strangers ; though he could not , for his life , have explained what Fund he meant , or how the notion had got rooted in his soul . He had fully convinced himself , notwithstanding , that his own proper share of the Fund was three and ninepence a week ; and that in this amount he , as an individual collegian , was swindled by the marshal , regularly every Monday . Apparently , he helped to make the bed , that he might not lose an opportunity of stating this case ; after which unloading of his mind , and after announcing ( as it seemed he always did , without anything coming of it ) that he was going to write a letter to the papers and show the marshal up , he fell into miscellaneous conversation with the rest . It was evident from the general tone of the whole party , that they had come to regard insolvency as the normal state of mankind , and the payment of debts as a disease that occasionally broke out . In this strange scene , and with these strange spectres flitting about him , Arthur Clennam looked on at the preparations as if they were part of a dream . Pending which , the long - initiated Tip , with an awful enjoyment of the Snuggery ’s resources , pointed out the common kitchen fire maintained by subscription of collegians , the boiler for hot water supported in like manner , and other premises generally tending to the deduction that the way to be healthy , wealthy , and wise , was to come to the Marshalsea . The two tables put together in a corner , were , at length , converted into a very fair bed ; and the stranger was left to the Windsor chairs , the presidential tribune , the beery atmosphere , sawdust , pipe - lights , spittoons and repose . But the last item was long , long , long , in linking itself to the rest . The novelty of the place , the coming upon it without preparation , the sense of being locked up , the remembrance of that room up - stairs , of the two brothers , and above all of the retiring childish form , and the face in which he now saw years of insufficient food , if not of want , kept him waking and unhappy . Speculations , too , bearing the strangest relations towards the prison , but always concerning the prison , ran like nightmares through his mind while he lay awake . Whether coffins were kept ready for people who might die there , where they were kept , how they were kept , where people who died in the prison were buried , how they were taken out , what forms were observed , whether an implacable creditor could arrest the dead ? As to escaping , what chances there were of escape ? Whether a prisoner could scale the walls with a cord and grapple , how he would descend upon the other side ? whether he could alight on a housetop , steal down a staircase , let himself out at a door , and get lost in the crowd ? As to Fire in the prison , if one were to break out while he lay there ? And these involuntary starts of fancy were , after all , but the setting of a picture in which three people kept before him . His father , with the steadfast look with which he had died , prophetically darkened forth in the portrait ; his mother , with her arm up , warding off his suspicion ; Little Dorrit , with her hand on the degraded arm , and her drooping head turned away . What if his mother had an old reason she well knew for softening to this poor girl ! What if the prisoner now sleeping quietly -- Heaven grant it!--by the light of the great Day of judgment should trace back his fall to her . What if any act of hers and of his father ’s , should have even remotely brought the grey heads of those two brothers so low ! A swift thought shot into his mind . In that long imprisonment here , and in her own long confinement to her room , did his mother find a balance to be struck ? ‘
44851	44923	44924	44924	He	1924	’ When all the other thoughts had faded out , this one held possession of him . When he fell asleep , she came before him in her wheeled chair , warding him off with this justification . When he awoke , and sprang up causelessly frightened , the words were in his ears , as if her voice had slowly spoken them at his pillow , to break his rest : ‘
44950	46003	46005	46005	you	1927	’ CHAPTER 9 . Little Mother The morning light was in no hurry to climb the prison wall and look in at the Snuggery windows ; and when it did come , it would have been more welcome if it had come alone , instead of bringing a rush of rain with it . But the equinoctial gales were blowing out at sea , and the impartial south - west wind , in its flight , would not neglect even the narrow Marshalsea . While it roared through the steeple of St George ’s Church , and twirled all the cowls in the neighbourhood , it made a swoop to beat the Southwark smoke into the jail ; and , plunging down the chimneys of the few early collegians who were yet lighting their fires , half suffocated them . Arthur Clennam would have been little disposed to linger in bed , though his bed had been in a more private situation , and less affected by the raking out of yesterday ’s fire , the kindling of to - day ’s under the collegiate boiler , the filling of that Spartan vessel at the pump , the sweeping and sawdusting of the common room , and other such preparations . Heartily glad to see the morning , though little rested by the night , he turned out as soon as he could distinguish objects about him , and paced the yard for two heavy hours before the gate was opened . The walls were so near to one another , and the wild clouds hurried over them so fast , that it gave him a sensation like the beginning of sea - sickness to look up at the gusty sky . The rain , carried aslant by flaws of wind , blackened that side of the central building which he had visited last night , but left a narrow dry trough under the lee of the wall , where he walked up and down among the waits of straw and dust and paper , the waste droppings of the pump , and the stray leaves of yesterday ’s greens . It was as haggard a view of life as a man need look upon . Nor was it relieved by any glimpse of the little creature who had brought him there . Perhaps she glided out of her doorway and in at that where her father lived , while his face was turned from both ; but he saw nothing of her . It was too early for her brother ; to have seen him once , was to have seen enough of him to know that he would be sluggish to leave whatever frowsy bed he occupied at night ; so , as Arthur Clennam walked up and down , waiting for the gate to open , he cast about in his mind for future rather than for present means of pursuing his discoveries . At last the lodge - gate turned , and the turnkey , standing on the step , taking an early comb at his hair , was ready to let him out . With a joyful sense of release he passed through the lodge , and found himself again in the little outer court - yard where he had spoken to the brother last night . There was a string of people already straggling in , whom it was not difficult to identify as the nondescript messengers , go - betweens , and errand - bearers of the place . Some of them had been lounging in the rain until the gate should open ; others , who had timed their arrival with greater nicety , were coming up now , and passing in with damp whitey - brown paper bags from the grocers , loaves of bread , lumps of butter , eggs , milk , and the like . The shabbiness of these attendants upon shabbiness , the poverty of these insolvent waiters upon insolvency , was a sight to see . Such threadbare coats and trousers , such fusty gowns and shawls , such squashed hats and bonnets , such boots and shoes , such umbrellas and walking - sticks , never were seen in Rag Fair . All of them wore the cast - off clothes of other men and women , were made up of patches and pieces of other people ’s individuality , and had no sartorial existence of their own proper . Their walk was the walk of a race apart . They had a peculiar way of doggedly slinking round the corner , as if they were eternally going to the pawnbroker ’s . When they coughed , they coughed like people accustomed to be forgotten on doorsteps and in draughty passages , waiting for answers to letters in faded ink , which gave the recipients of those manuscripts great mental disturbance and no satisfaction . As they eyed the stranger in passing , they eyed him with borrowing eyes -- hungry , sharp , speculative as to his softness if they were accredited to him , and the likelihood of his standing something handsome . Mendicity on commission stooped in their high shoulders , shambled in their unsteady legs , buttoned and pinned and darned and dragged their clothes , frayed their button - holes , leaked out of their figures in dirty little ends of tape , and issued from their mouths in alcoholic breathings . As these people passed him standing still in the court - yard , and one of them turned back to inquire if he could assist him with his services , it came into Arthur Clennam ’s mind that he would speak to Little Dorrit again before he went away . She would have recovered her first surprise , and might feel easier with him . He asked this member of the fraternity ( who had two red herrings in his hand , and a loaf and a blacking brush under his arm ) , where was the nearest place to get a cup of coffee at . The nondescript replied in encouraging terms , and brought him to a coffee - shop in the street within a stone ’s throw . ‘
46010	46325	46326	46326	Dorrit	349	’ asked the new client . The nondescript knew two Miss Dorrits ; one who was born inside -- That was the one ! That was the one ? The nondescript had known her many years . In regard of the other Miss Dorrit , the nondescript lodged in the same house with herself and uncle . This changed the client ’s half - formed design of remaining at the coffee - shop until the nondescript should bring him word that Dorrit had issued forth into the street . He entrusted the nondescript with a confidential message to her , importing that the visitor who had waited on her father last night , begged the favour of a few words with her at her uncle ’s lodging ; he obtained from the same source full directions to the house , which was very near ; dismissed the nondescript gratified with half - a - crown ; and having hastily refreshed himself at the coffee - shop , repaired with all speed to the clarionet - player ’s dwelling . There were so many lodgers in this house that the doorpost seemed to be as full of bell - handles as a cathedral organ is of stops . Doubtful which might be the clarionet - stop , he was considering the point , when a shuttlecock flew out of the parlour window , and alighted on his hat . He then observed that in the parlour window was a blind with the inscription , MR CRIPPLES ’s ACADEMY ; also in another line , EVENING TUITION ; and behind the blind was a little white - faced boy , with a slice of bread - and - butter and a battledore . The window being accessible from the footway , he looked in over the blind , returned the shuttlecock , and put his question . ‘
46328	46343	46326	46326	Dorrit	349	’ said the little white - faced boy ( Master Cripples in fact ) . ‘
46355	46391	46392	46393	Old Dorrit	354	’ The pupils of Mr Cripples appeared to have been making a copy - book of the street - door , it was so extensively scribbled over in pencil . The frequency of the inscriptions , ‘
46395	46397	46392	46393	Old Dorrit	354	’ and ‘
46401	46438	46398	46399	Dirty Dick	355	’ in combination , suggested intentions of personality on the part Of Mr Cripples ’s pupils . There was ample time to make these observations before the door was opened by the poor old man himself . ‘
46441	46450	46462	46463	Mr Dorrit	353	’ said he , very slowly remembering Arthur , ‘
46458	46459	46451	46451	you	353	’ ‘
46474	46475	46462	46463	Mr Dorrit	353	’ ‘
46478	46484	46462	46463	Mr Dorrit	353	’ said he , pondering . ‘
46505	46506	46495	46495	you	353	’ ‘
46510	46726	46508	46508	you	353	’ Turning himself as slowly as he turned in his mind whatever he heard or said , he led the way up the narrow stairs . The house was very close , and had an unwholesome smell . The little staircase windows looked in at the back windows of other houses as unwholesome as itself , with poles and lines thrust out of them , on which unsightly linen hung ; as if the inhabitants were angling for clothes , and had had some wretched bites not worth attending to . In the back garret -- a sickly room , with a turn - up bedstead in it , so hastily and recently turned up that the blankets were boiling over , as it were , and keeping the lid open -- a half - finished breakfast of coffee and toast for two persons was jumbled down anyhow on a rickety table . There was no one there . The old man mumbling to himself , after some consideration , that Fanny had run away , went to the next room to fetch her back . The visitor , observing that she held the door on the inside , and that , when the uncle tried to open it , there was a sharp adjuration of ‘
46732	46801	46508	46508	you	353	’ and an appearance of loose stocking and flannel , concluded that the young lady was in an undress . The uncle , without appearing to come to any conclusion , shuffled in again , sat down in his chair , and began warming his hands at the fire ; not that it was cold , or that he had any waking idea whether it was or not . ‘
46812	46847	46804	46804	you	1932	’ he asked , when he by - and - by discovered what he was doing , left off , reached over to the chimney - piece , and took his clarionet case down . ‘
46852	46872	46804	46804	you	1932	’ said Arthur , very much at a loss , for his thoughts were on the brother before him ; ‘
46881	46882	46804	46804	you	1932	’ ‘
46885	46891	46804	46804	you	1932	’ muttered the old man , ‘
46902	47009	47010	47010	Amy	349	’ Arthur wondered what he could possibly want with the clarionet case . He did not want it at all . He discovered , in due time , that it was not the little paper of snuff ( which was also on the chimney - piece ) , put it back again , took down the snuff instead , and solaced himself with a pinch . He was as feeble , spare , and slow in his pinches as in everything else , but a certain little trickling of enjoyment of them played in the poor worn nerves about the corners of his eyes and mouth . ‘
47022	47023	47017	47017	you	304	’ ‘
47045	47046	47029	47030	Mr Dorrit	353	’ ‘
47057	47061	47062	47062	We	1936	’ he returned . ‘
47085	47358	47082	47082	her	349	’ Arthur fancied that he heard in these praises a certain tone of custom , which he had heard from the father last night with an inward protest and feeling of antagonism . It was not that they stinted her praises , or were insensible to what she did for them ; but that they were lazily habituated to her , as they were to all the rest of their condition . He fancied that although they had before them , every day , the means of comparison between her and one another and themselves , they regarded her as being in her necessary place ; as holding a position towards them all which belonged to her , like her name or her age . He fancied that they viewed her , not as having risen away from the prison atmosphere , but as appertaining to it ; as being vaguely what they had a right to expect , and nothing more . Her uncle resumed his breakfast , and was munching toast sopped in coffee , oblivious of his guest , when the third bell rang . That was Amy , he said , and went down to let her in ; leaving the visitor with as vivid a picture on his mind of his begrimed hands , dirt - worn face , and decayed figure , as if he were still drooping in his chair . She came up after him , in the usual plain dress , and with the usual timid manner . Her lips were a little parted , as if her heart beat faster than usual . ‘
47364	47369	47362	47362	Amy	349	’ said her uncle , ‘
47377	47378	47362	47362	Amy	349	’ ‘
47389	47390	47379	47379	I	0	’ ‘
47398	47399	47391	47391	I	0	’ ‘
47422	47423	47429	47429	sir	933	’ ‘
47439	47440	47442	47442	you	304	’ ‘
47481	47723	47458	47458	I	0	’ She looked embarrassed , but said , if he pleased . He made a pretence of having mislaid his walking - stick , to give her time to set the bedstead right , to answer her sister ’s impatient knock at the wall , and to say a word softly to her uncle . Then he found it , and they went down - stairs ; she first , he following ; the uncle standing at the stair - head , and probably forgetting them before they had reached the ground floor . Mr Cripples ’s pupils , who were by this time coming to school , desisted from their morning recreation of cuffing one another with bags and books , to stare with all the eyes they had at a stranger who had been to see Dirty Dick . They bore the trying spectacle in silence , until the mysterious visitor was at a safe distance ; when they burst into pebbles and yells , and likewise into reviling dances , and in all respects buried the pipe of peace with so many savage ceremonies , that , if Mr Cripples had been the chief of the Cripplewayboo tribe with his war - paint on , they could scarcely have done greater justice to their education . In the midst of this homage , Mr Arthur Clennam offered his arm to Little Dorrit , and Little Dorrit took it . ‘
47732	47736	47994	47994	she	1947	’ said he , ‘
47749	47766	47994	47994	she	1947	’ Little Dorrit answered , if he pleased , and presently ventured to hope that he would ‘
47769	47942	47943	47943	I	0	’ Mr Cripples ’s boys , for she had herself received her education , such as it was , in Mr Cripples ’s evening academy . He returned , with the best will in the world , that Mr Cripples ’s boys were forgiven out of the bottom of his soul . Thus did Cripples unconsciously become a master of the ceremonies between them , and bring them more naturally together than Beau Nash might have done if they had lived in his golden days , and he had alighted from his coach and six for the purpose . The morning remained squally , and the streets were miserably muddy , but no rain fell as they walked towards the Iron Bridge . The little creature seemed so young in his eyes , that there were moments when he found himself thinking of her , if not speaking to her , as if she were a child . Perhaps he seemed as old in her eyes as she seemed young in his . ‘
47968	47984	47994	47994	she	1947	’ It was nothing , he returned . He had had a very good bed . ‘
47988	47993	47994	47994	she	1947	’ she said quickly ; ‘
48006	48029	47994	47994	she	1947	’ He noticed that the coffee - house was quite a majestic hotel to her , and that she treasured its reputation . ‘
48037	48042	48030	48030	I	0	’ said Little Dorrit , ‘
48061	48066	48044	48045	my father	9706	’ she added timidly . ‘
48072	48073	48068	48068	you	9706	’ ‘
48086	48112	48068	48068	you	9706	’ To think of growing up with a kind of awe upon one as to the luxuries of that superb establishment , the Marshalsea Hotel ! ‘
48119	48123	48113	48113	I	0	’ said Clennam , ‘
48145	48146	48140	48140	she	9736	’ ‘
48151	48152	48140	48140	she	9736	’ ‘
48161	48162	48165	48165	sir	933	’ ‘
48167	48205	48165	48165	sir	933	’ He met her eyes raised to his with so much wonder in them ( she was scared when the encounter took place , and shrunk away again ) , that he felt it necessary to say : ‘
48271	48272	48250	48250	you	9706	’ ‘
48277	48422	48250	48250	you	9706	’ He felt , from the tone in which she spoke , that she was glancing up at him with those parted lips ; therefore he looked before him , rather than make her heart beat quicker still by embarrassing her afresh . Thus they emerged upon the Iron Bridge , which was as quiet after the roaring streets as though it had been open country . The wind blew roughly , the wet squalls came rattling past them , skimming the pools on the road and pavement , and raining them down into the river . The clouds raced on furiously in the lead - coloured sky , the smoke and mist raced after them , the dark tide ran fierce and strong in the same direction . Little Dorrit seemed the least , the quietest , and weakest of Heaven ’s creatures . ‘
48431	48438	48250	48250	you	9706	’ said Clennam , very nearly adding ‘
48443	48509	48510	48510	You	1959	’ She hurriedly declined , saying that wet or dry made little difference to her ; she was used to go about in all weathers . He knew it to be so , and was touched with more pity ; thinking of the slight figure at his side , making its nightly way through the damp dark boisterous streets to such a place of rest . ‘
48561	48579	48553	48553	I	0	’ she hesitated and trembled , and tears rose in her eyes , but did not fall . ‘
48585	48586	48553	48553	I	0	’ ‘
48641	48642	48631	48631	he	9706	’ ‘

48661	48686	48655	48655	me	0	’ she said , with a prouder air , as the misgiving evidently crept upon her that she might seem to be abandoning him , ‘
48784	48805	48773	48773	He	9706	’ If ever pride were innocent , it was innocent in Little Dorrit when she grew boastful of her father . ‘
48894	48928	48858	48858	they	1972	’ What affection in her words , what compassion in her repressed tears , what a great soul of fidelity within her , how true the light that shed false brightness round him ! ‘
49090	49115	49116	49116	I	0	’ She had relieved the faithful fulness of her heart , and modestly said , raising her eyes appealingly to her new friend ’s , ‘
49211	49245	49246	49246	I	0	’ He told her with perfect truth that it was not the case ; and putting himself between her and the sharp wind and rain , sheltered her as well as he could . ‘
49251	49255	49246	49246	I	0	’ he said , ‘
49271	49272	49269	49269	creditors	10087	’ ‘
49279	49280	49269	49269	creditors	10087	’ ‘
49293	49294	49305	49305	you	1988	’ ‘
49302	49303	49305	49305	you	1988	’ ‘
49332	49373	49305	49305	you	1988	’ Little Dorrit said , after considering a little , that she used to hear long ago of Mr Tite Barnacle as a man of great power . He was a commissioner , or a board , or a trustee , ‘
49377	49448	49305	49305	you	1988	’ He lived in Grosvenor Square , she thought , or very near it . He was under Government -- high in the Circumlocution Office . She appeared to have acquired , in her infancy , some awful impression of the might of this formidable Mr Tite Barnacle of Grosvenor Square , or very near it , and the Circumlocution Office , which quite crushed her when she mentioned him . ‘
49455	49459	49305	49305	you	1988	’ thought Arthur , ‘
49468	49484	49464	49466	Mr Tite Barnacle	357	’ The thought did not present itself so quietly but that her quickness intercepted it . ‘
49487	49503	49464	49466	Mr Tite Barnacle	357	’ said Little Dorrit , shaking her head with the mild despair of a lifetime . ‘
49527	49594	49518	49518	you	1995	’ She forgot to be shy at the moment , in honestly warning him away from the sunken wreck he had a dream of raising ; and looked at him with eyes which assuredly , in association with her patient face , her fragile figure , her spare dress , and the wind and rain , did not turn him from his purpose of helping her . ‘
49602	49691	49697	49697	she	1996	’ said she--‘and it never can be done now -- where could father live , or how could he live ? I have often thought that if such a change could come , it might be anything but a service to him now . People might not think so well of him outside as they do there . He might not be so gently dealt with outside as he is there . He might not be so fit himself for the life outside as he is for that . ’
49727	49777	49778	49778	He	1997	‘ It would be a new distress to him even to know that I earn a little money , and that Fanny earns a little money . He is so anxious about us , you see , feeling helplessly shut up there . Such a good , good father ! ’
49882	49895	49870	49870	she	1996	‘ You would be glad to have your brother set at liberty ? ’
49896	49905	49934	49935	Little Dorrit	274	‘ Oh very , very glad , sir ! ’
49906	49928	49929	49929	His	2004	‘ Well , we will hope for him at least . You told me last night of a friend you had ? ’
49953	49958	49959	49960	Little Dorrit	274	‘ only a plasterer , ’
50048	50054	50055	50055	he	304	‘ There is one friend ! ’
50063	50075	50055	50055	he	304	‘ As I take you back -- you are going back ? ’
50076	50084	50055	50055	he	304	‘ Oh yes ! going straight home . ’
50085	50092	50055	50055	he	304	‘ --As I take you back , ’
50100	50124	50055	50055	he	304	‘ let me ask you to persuade yourself that you have another friend . I make no professions , and say no more . ’
50125	50143	50144	50144	They	2008	‘ You are truly kind to me , sir . I am sure I need no more . ’
50340	50347	50348	50349	Little Dorrit	274	‘ Little mother , little mother ! ’
50368	50371	50355	50361	an excited figure of a strange kind	2015	‘ little mother ’
50394	50399	50401	50402	Little Dorrit	274	‘ Oh , Maggy , ’
50404	50412	50401	50402	Little Dorrit	274	‘ what a clumsy child you are ! ’
50742	50750	50733	50734	Little Dorrit	274	‘ May I ask who this is ? ’
50790	50797	50805	50807	the personage presented	2022	‘ This is Maggy , sir . ’
50798	50803	50805	50807	the personage presented	2022	‘ Maggy , sir , ’
50809	50813	50805	50807	the personage presented	2022	‘ Little mother ! ’
50814	50821	50823	50824	Little Dorrit	274	‘ She is the grand - daughter-- ’
50826	50831	50833	50833	Maggy	358	‘ Grand - daughter , ’
50835	50856	50833	50833	Maggy	358	‘ Of my old nurse , who has been dead a long time . Maggy , how old are you ? ’
50857	50862	50864	50864	Maggy	358	‘ Ten , mother , ’
50866	50878	50880	50881	Little Dorrit	274	‘ You ca n’t think how good she is , sir , ’
50887	50894	50896	50896	Maggy	358	‘ Good _ she _ is , ’
50913	50918	50920	50921	Little Dorrit	274	‘ Or how clever , ’
50923	50934	50935	50935	Maggy	358	‘ She goes on errands as well as any one . ’
50938	50949	50950	50950	Maggy	358	‘ And is as trustworthy as the Bank of England . ’
50953	50965	50967	50968	Little Dorrit	274	‘ She earns her own living entirely . Entirely , sir ! ’
50977	50981	50967	50968	Little Dorrit	274	‘ Really does ! ’
50982	50988	50990	50990	Clennam	304	‘ What is her history ? ’
50992	50999	51001	51002	Little Dorrit	274	‘ Think of that , Maggy ? ’
51014	51029	51038	51038	Maggy	358	‘ A gentleman from thousands of miles away , wanting to know your history ! ’
51030	51036	51038	51038	Maggy	358	‘ _ My _ history ? ’
51040	51044	51038	51038	Maggy	358	‘ Little mother . ’
51045	51050	51052	51053	Little Dorrit	274	‘ She means me , ’
51058	51087	51052	51053	Little Dorrit	274	‘ she is very much attached to me . Her old grandmother was not so kind to her as she should have been ; was she , Maggy ? ’
51111	51114	51088	51088	Maggy	358	‘ Gin . ’
51124	51131	51088	51088	Maggy	358	‘ Broom - handles and pokers . ’
51132	51140	51142	51143	Little Dorrit	274	‘ When Maggy was ten years old , ’
51152	51171	51142	51143	Little Dorrit	274	‘ she had a bad fever , sir , and she has never grown any older ever since . ’
51172	51177	51179	51179	Maggy	358	‘ Ten years old , ’
51185	51210	51142	51143	Little Dorrit	274	‘ But what a nice hospital ! So comfortable , was n’t it ? Oh so nice it was . Such a Ev’nly place ! ’
51211	51222	51224	51225	Little Dorrit	274	‘ She had never been at peace before , sir , ’
51237	51246	51224	51225	Little Dorrit	274	‘ and she always runs off upon that . ’
51247	51254	51256	51256	Maggy	358	‘ Such beds there is there ! ’
51258	51287	51256	51256	Maggy	358	‘ Such lemonades ! Such oranges ! Such d’licious broth and wine ! Such Chicking ! Oh , AIN’T it a delightful place to go and stop at ! ’
51288	51299	51301	51302	Little Dorrit	274	‘ So Maggy stopped there as long as she could , ’
51323	51358	51305	51305	her	274	‘ and at last , when she could stop there no longer , she came out . Then , because she was never to be more than ten years old , however long she lived-- ’
51359	51365	51367	51367	Maggy	358	‘ However long she lived , ’
51369	51398	51400	51400	Maggy	358	‘ --And because she was very weak ; indeed was so weak that when she began to laugh she could n’t stop herself -- which was a great pity-- ’
51408	51490	51492	51493	Little Dorrit	274	‘ --Her grandmother did not know what to do with her , and for some years was very unkind to her indeed . At length , in course of time , Maggy began to take pains to improve herself , and to be very attentive and very industrious ; and by degrees was allowed to come in and out as often as she liked , and got enough to do to support herself , and does support herself . And that , ’
51503	51513	51492	51493	Little Dorrit	274	‘ is Maggy ’s history , as Maggy knows ! ’
54018	54046	54048	54049	Barnacle Junior	361	‘ Oh , I say . Look here ! My father ’s not in the way , and wo n’t be in the way to - day , ’
54051	54060	54048	54049	Barnacle Junior	361	‘ Is this anything that I can do ? ’
54087	54093	54095	54096	Arthur Clennam	304	‘ You are very good , ’
54098	54107	54095	54096	Arthur Clennam	304	‘ I wish however to see Mr Barnacle . ’
54108	54126	54128	54129	Barnacle Junior	361	‘ But I say . Look here ! You have n’t got any appointment , you know , ’
54150	54153	54155	54156	Arthur Clennam	304	‘ No , ’
54158	54167	54155	54156	Arthur Clennam	304	‘ That is what I wish to have . ’

54216	54220	54222	54223	Barnacle junior	357	‘ Is it , ’
54234	54246	54253	54253	he	357	‘ anything about -- Tonnage -- or that sort of thing ? ’
54281	54284	54286	54286	Arthur	304	‘ No , ’
54288	54295	54286	54286	Arthur	304	‘ it is nothing about tonnage . ’
54296	54306	54253	54253	he	357	‘ Then look here . Is it private business ? ’
54307	54321	54286	54286	Arthur	304	‘ I really am not sure . It relates to a Mr Dorrit . ’
54322	54375	54377	54380	The misguided young Barnacle	357	‘ Look here , I tell you what ! You had better call at our house , if you are going that way . Twenty - four , Mews Street , Grosvenor Square . My father ’s got a slight touch of the gout , and is kept at home by it . ’
54404	54417	54418	54419	Young Barnacle	363	‘ Thank you . I will call there now . Good morning . ’
54435	54441	54443	54444	Barnacle junior	357	‘ You are quite sure , ’
54468	54476	54443	54444	Barnacle junior	357	‘ that it ’s nothing about Tonnage ? ’
54477	54481	54443	54444	Barnacle junior	357	‘ Quite sure . ’
55008	55043	54992	54992	he	357	‘ Be so good as to give that card to Mr Tite Barnacle , and to say that I have just now seen the younger Mr Barnacle , who recommended me to call here . ’

55634	55669	55671	55671	you	2217	’ Mr Barnacle tapped his fingers on the table , and , as if he were now sitting for his portrait to a new and strange artist , appeared to say to his visitor , ‘

55771	55799	55767	55767	I	0	’ It being one of the principles of the Circumlocution Office never , on any account whatever , to give a straightforward answer , Mr Barnacle said , ‘

56129	56298	56299	56299	I	0	’ Mr Barnacle made him a severe bow , as a wounded man of family , a wounded man of place , and a wounded man of a gentlemanly residence , all rolled into one ; and he made Mr Barnacle a bow , and was shut out into Mews Street by the flabby footman . Having got to this pass , he resolved as an exercise in perseverance , to betake himself again to the Circumlocution Office , and try what satisfaction he could get there . So he went back to the Circumlocution Office , and once more sent up his card to Barnacle junior by a messenger who took it very ill indeed that he should come back again , and who was eating mashed potatoes and gravy behind a partition by the hall fire . He was readmitted to the presence of Barnacle junior , and found that young gentleman singeing his knees now , and gaping his weary way on to four o’clock . ‘
56316	56326	56305	56305	You	2239	’ Said Barnacle junior , looking over his shoulder . ‘

56514	56523	56503	56503	You	2239	’ he then observed with the greatest weakness . ‘

56845	56963	56830	56843	the gentleman with the gun - barrel , who was an extremely deliberate speaker	2256	‘ down to his cousin ’s place , and took the Dog with him by rail . Inestimable Dog . Flew at the porter fellow when he was put into the dog - box , and flew at the guard when he was taken out . He got half - a - dozen fellows into a Barn , and a good supply of Rats , and timed the Dog . Finding the Dog able to do it immensely , made the match , and heavily backed the Dog . When the match came off , some devil of a fellow was bought over , Sir , Dog was made drunk , Dog ’s master was cleaned out . ’
56964	56968	56970	56971	the suitor	10728	‘ Mr Wobbler ? ’
56989	56997	56973	56979	The gentleman who was spreading the marmalade	2258	‘ What did he call the Dog ? ’
56998	57003	57005	57007	the other gentleman	2259	‘ Called him Lovely , ’
57009	57035	57005	57007	the other gentleman	2259	‘ Said the Dog was the perfect picture of the old aunt from whom he had expectations . Found him particularly like her when hocussed . ’

57107	57111	57113	57114	the suitor	10728	‘ Mr Wobbler ? ’
57116	57122	57129	57129	his	369	‘ What ’s the matter ? ’
57133	57138	57129	57129	his	369	‘ I want to know-- ’
57152	57158	57160	57161	Mr Wobbler	369	‘ Ca n’t inform you , ’
57168	57197	57160	57161	Mr Wobbler	369	‘ Never heard of it . Nothing at all to do with it . Better try Mr Clive , second door on the left in the next passage . ’
57198	57208	57222	57223	Mr Wobbler	369	‘ Perhaps he will give me the same answer . ’
57209	57220	57222	57223	Mr Wobbler	369	‘ Very likely . Do n’t know anything about it , ’
57243	57248	57249	57249	He	9761	‘ Mister ! Hallo ! ’

57272	57405	57249	57249	He	9761	’ A few steps brought him to the second door on the left in the next passage . In that room he found three gentlemen ; number one doing nothing particular , number two doing nothing particular , number three doing nothing particular . They seemed , however , to be more directly concerned than the others had been in the effective execution of the great principle of the office , as there was an awful inner apartment with a double door , in which the Circumlocution Sages appeared to be assembled in council , and out of which there was an imposing coming of papers , and into which there was an imposing going of papers , almost constantly ; wherein another gentleman , number four , was the active instrument . ‘
57411	57511	57249	57249	He	9761	’ said Arthur Clennam,--and again stated his case in the same barrel - organ way . As number one referred him to number two , and as number two referred him to number three , he had occasion to state it three times before they all referred him to number four , to whom he stated it again . Number four was a vivacious , well - looking , well - dressed , agreeable young fellow -- he was a Barnacle , but on the more sprightly side of the family -- and he said in an easy way , ‘

57617	57635	57614	57615	number four	10761	‘ Would it be such hopeless work ? Excuse me ; I am a stranger in England . ’
57636	57648	57650	57651	number four	10761	‘ _ I _ do n’t say it would be hopeless , ’
57658	57723	57650	57651	number four	10761	‘ I do n’t express an opinion about that ; I only express an opinion about you . _ I _ do n’t think you ’d go on with it . However , of course , you can do as you like . I suppose there was a failure in the performance of a contract , or something of that kind , was there ? ’
57724	57731	57614	57615	number four	10761	‘ I really do n’t know . ’
57732	57764	57614	57615	number four	10761	‘ Well ! That you can find out . Then you ’ll find out what Department the contract was in , and then you ’ll find out all about it there . ’
57765	57777	57650	57651	number four	10761	‘ I beg your pardon . How shall I find out ? ’
57778	57897	57614	57615	number four	10761	‘ Why , you’ll -- you’ll ask till they tell you . Then you ’ll memorialise that Department ( according to regular forms which you ’ll find out ) for leave to memorialise this Department . If you get it ( which you may after a time ) , that memorial must be entered in that Department , sent to be registered in this Department , sent back to be signed by that Department , sent back to be countersigned by this Department , and then it will begin to be regularly before that Department . You ’ll find out when the business passes through each of these stages by asking at both Departments till they tell you . ’
57898	57911	57614	57615	number four	10761	‘ But surely this is not the way to do the business , ’
57958	57961	57614	57615	number four	10761	‘ got up ’
58036	58050	58052	58055	this bright young Barnacle	2276	‘ When the business is regularly before that Department , whatever it is , ’
58057	58190	58052	58055	this bright young Barnacle	2276	‘ then you can watch it from time to time through that Department . When it comes regularly before this Department , then you must watch it from time to time through this Department . We shall have to refer it right and left ; and when we refer it anywhere , then you ’ll have to look it up . When it comes back to us at any time , then you had better look _ us _ up . When it sticks anywhere , you ’ll have to try to give it a jog . When you write to another Department about it , and then to this Department about it , and do n’t hear anything satisfactory about it , why then you had better -- keep on writing . ’

59262	59289	59195	59196	Mr Meagles	288	‘ No . You would not . I know you would not . You would n’t suppose him to be a public offender ; would you ? ’

59294	59344	59195	59196	Mr Meagles	288	‘ No . But he is . He is a public offender . What has he been guilty of ? Murder , manslaughter , arson , forgery , swindling , house - breaking , highway robbery , larceny , conspiracy , fraud ? Which should you say , now ? ’
59345	59350	59195	59196	Mr Meagles	288	‘ I should say , ’
59365	59371	59352	59353	Arthur Clennam	304	‘ not one of them . ’
59372	59377	59379	59380	Mr Meagles	288	‘ You are right , ’
59382	59414	59379	59380	Mr Meagles	288	‘ But he has been ingenious , and he has been trying to turn his ingenuity to his country ’s service . That makes him a public offender directly , sir . ’

59437	59533	59535	59536	Mr Meagles	288	‘ is a smith and engineer . He is not in a large way , but he is well known as a very ingenious man . A dozen years ago , he perfects an invention ( involving a very curious secret process ) of great importance to his country and his fellow - creatures . I wo n’t say how much money it cost him , or how many years of his life he had been about it , but he brought it to perfection a dozen years ago . Was n’t it a dozen ? ’
59541	59556	59539	59539	Doyce	374	‘ He is the most exasperating man in the world ; he never complains ! ’
59557	59567	59574	59575	Mr Meagles	288	‘ Yes . Rather better than twelve years ago . ’
59568	59572	59574	59575	Mr Meagles	288	‘ Rather better ? ’
59577	59612	59614	59615	Mr Meagles	288	‘ you mean rather worse . Well , Mr Clennam , he addresses himself to the Government . The moment he addresses himself to the Government , he becomes a public offender ! Sir , ’
59626	59743	59614	59615	Mr Meagles	288	‘ he ceases to be an innocent citizen , and becomes a culprit . He is treated from that instant as a man who has done some infernal action . He is a man to be shirked , put off , brow - beaten , sneered at , handed over by this highly - connected young or old gentleman , to that highly - connected young or old gentleman , and dodged back again ; he is a man with no rights in his own time , or his own property ; a mere outlaw , whom it is justifiable to get rid of anyhow ; a man to be worn out by all possible means . ’
59763	59780	59782	59783	Mr Meagles	288	‘ Do n’t stand there , Doyce , turning your spectacle - case over and over , ’
59785	59796	59782	59783	Mr Meagles	288	‘ but tell Mr Clennam what you confessed to me . ’
59797	59805	59807	59808	the inventor	2311	‘ I undoubtedly was made to feel , ’
59810	59889	59807	59808	the inventor	2311	‘ as if I had committed an offence . In dancing attendance at the various offices , I was always treated , more or less , as if it was a very bad offence . I have frequently found it necessary to reflect , for my own self - support , that I really had not done anything to bring myself into the Newgate Calendar , but only wanted to effect a great saving and a great improvement . ’
59890	59893	59895	59896	Mr Meagles	288	‘ There ! ’
59898	59922	59895	59896	Mr Meagles	288	‘ Judge whether I exaggerate . Now you ’ll be able to believe me when I tell you the rest of the case . ’
60233	60248	60277	60282	the head of the Circumlocution Office	2116	‘ saw no reason to reverse the decision at which my lords had arrived . ’

60367	60452	60364	60365	Mr Meagles	288	‘ as a practical man , I then and there , in that presence , took Doyce by the collar , and told him it was plain to me that he was an infamous rascal and treasonable disturber of the government peace , and took him away . I brought him out of the office door by the collar , that the very porter might know I was a practical man who appreciated the official estimate of such characters ; and here we are ! ’
60556	60559	60561	60562	Mr Meagles	288	‘ There ! ’
60564	60595	60561	60562	Mr Meagles	288	‘ now you know all about Doyce . Except , which I own does not improve my state of mind , that even now you do n’t hear him complain . ’

60669	60737	60664	60664	he	374	‘ You see , my experience of these things does not begin with myself . It has been in my way to know a little about them from time to time . Mine is not a particular case . I am not worse used than a hundred others who have put themselves in the same position -- than all the others , I was going to say . ’
60738	60766	60664	60664	he	374	‘ I do n’t know that I should find that a consolation , if it were my case ; but I am very glad that you do . ’
60767	60776	60777	60777	he	374	‘ Understand me ! I do n’t say , ’
60802	60833	60777	60777	he	374	‘ that it ’s recompense for a man ’s toil and hope ; but it ’s a certain sort of relief to know that I might have counted on this . ’
60906	60909	60910	60910	he	374	‘ Disappointed ? ’
60923	60970	60915	60915	he	374	‘ Yes . No doubt I am disappointed . Hurt ? Yes . No doubt I am hurt . That ’s only natural . But what I mean when I say that people who put themselves in the same position are mostly used in the same way-- ’
60971	60975	60977	60978	Mr Meagles	288	‘ In England , ’
60980	61015	60977	60978	Mr Meagles	288	‘ Oh ! of course I mean in England . When they take their inventions into foreign countries , that ’s quite different . And that ’s the reason why so many go there . ’
61023	61077	61016	61017	Mr Meagles	288	‘ What I mean is , that however this comes to be the regular way of our government , it is its regular way . Have you ever heard of any projector or inventor who failed to find it all but inaccessible , and whom it did not discourage and ill - treat ? ’
61078	61088	60915	60915	he	374	‘ I can not say that I ever have . ’
61089	61118	61016	61017	Mr Meagles	288	‘ Have you ever known it to be beforehand in the adoption of any useful thing ? Ever known it to set an example of any useful kind ? ’
61119	61131	61133	61134	Mr Meagles	288	‘ I am a good deal older than my friend here , ’
61136	61145	61133	61134	Mr Meagles	288	‘ and I ’ll answer that . Never . ’
61146	61157	61159	61160	the inventor	2311	‘ But we all three have known , I expect , ’
61162	61216	61159	61160	the inventor	2311	‘ a pretty many cases of its fixed determination to be miles upon miles , and years upon years , behind the rest of us ; and of its being found out persisting in the use of things long superseded , even after the better things were well known and generally taken up ? ’
61223	61227	61229	61229	Doyce	374	‘ Well then , ’
61235	61338	61341	61341	he	374	‘ as I know what such a metal will do at such a temperature , and such a body under such a pressure , so I may know ( if I will only consider ) , how these great lords and gentlemen will certainly deal with such a matter as mine . I have no right to be surprised , with a head upon my shoulders , and memory in it , that I fall into the ranks with all who came before me . I ought to have let it alone . I have had warning enough , I am sure . ’
61354	61399	61341	61341	he	374	‘ If I do n’t complain , Mr Clennam , I can feel gratitude ; and I assure you that I feel it towards our mutual friend . Many ’s the day , and many ’s the way in which he has backed me . ’
61400	61405	61407	61408	Mr Meagles	288	‘ Stuff and nonsense , ’
61542	61547	61549	61549	he	374	‘ Come , come ! ’
61551	61572	61549	61549	he	374	‘ We shall not make this the better by being grim . Where do you think of going , Dan ? ’
61573	61582	61584	61584	Dan	374	‘ I shall go back to the factory , ’
61586	61605	61607	61608	Mr Meagles	288	‘ Why then , we ’ll all go back to the factory , or walk in that direction , ’
61611	61626	61607	61608	Mr Meagles	288	‘ Mr Clennam wo n’t be deterred by its being in Bleeding Heart Yard . ’
61627	61632	61634	61634	Clennam	304	‘ Bleeding Heart Yard ? ’
61636	61643	61634	61634	Clennam	304	‘ I want to go there . ’
61644	61650	61652	61653	Mr Meagles	288	‘ So much the better , ’
61655	61659	61652	61653	Mr Meagles	288	‘ Come along ! ’
62034	62077	62025	62025	he	2358	‘ To the devil with this plain that has no end ! To the devil with these stones that cut like knives ! To the devil with this dismal darkness , wrapping itself about one with a chill ! I hate you ! ’
62117	62164	62100	62100	He	2358	‘ I , hungry , thirsty , weary . You , imbeciles , where the lights are yonder , eating and drinking , and warming yourselves at fires ! I wish I had the sacking of your town ; I would repay you , my children ! ’
62652	62663	62647	62648	the landlady	2389	‘ One can lodge here to - night , madame ? ’
62664	62667	62669	62670	the landlady	2389	‘ Perfectly ! ’
62682	62698	62669	62670	the landlady	2389	‘ Good . One can dine -- sup -- what you please to call it ? ’
62699	62704	62706	62709	the landlady as before	2391	‘ Ah , perfectly ! ’
62711	62741	62706	62709	the landlady as before	2391	‘ Dispatch then , madame , if you please . Something to eat , as quickly as you can ; and some wine at once . I am exhausted . ’
62742	62751	62753	62754	the landlady	2389	‘ It is very bad weather , monsieur , ’
62756	62760	62753	62754	the landlady	2389	‘ Cursed weather . ’
62761	62768	62706	62709	the landlady as before	2391	‘ And a very long road . ’
62769	62774	62775	62775	His	10193	‘ A cursed road . ’
62940	62947	62951	62951	them	2394	‘ That ’s the true reason , ’
62965	62981	62956	62956	he	10193	‘ that ’s the true reason why they said that the devil was let loose . ’
63095	63101	63103	63103	she	2389	‘ Ah Heaven , then , ’
63105	63142	63103	63103	she	2389	‘ When the boat came up from Lyons , and brought the news that the devil was actually let loose at Marseilles , some fly - catchers swallowed it . But I ? No , not I. ’
63143	63151	63153	63155	the tall Swiss	2405	‘ Madame , you are always right , ’
63157	63168	63153	63155	the tall Swiss	2405	‘ Doubtless you were enraged against that man , madame ? ’
63169	63176	63178	63179	the landlady	2389	‘ Ay , yes , then ! ’
63201	63206	63195	63195	her	2389	‘ Naturally , yes . ’
63207	63214	63224	63225	the landlady	2389	‘ He was a bad subject . ’
63215	63222	63224	63225	the landlady	2389	‘ He was a wicked wretch , ’
63227	63245	63224	63225	the landlady	2389	‘ and well merited what he had the good fortune to escape . So much the worse . ’
63246	63255	63257	63258	the Swiss	2408	‘ Stay , madame ! Let us see , ’
63268	63314	63265	63265	his	2408	‘ It may have been his unfortunate destiny . He may have been the child of circumstances . It is always possible that he had , and has , good in him if one did but know how to find it out . Philosophical philanthropy teaches-- ’
63364	63373	63380	63380	her	2411	‘ Hold there , you and your philanthropy , ’
63386	63574	63380	63380	her	2411	‘ Listen then . I am a woman , I. I know nothing of philosophical philanthropy . But I know what I have seen , and what I have looked in the face in this world here , where I find myself . And I tell you this , my friend , that there are people ( men and women both , unfortunately ) who have no good in them -- none . That there are people whom it is necessary to detest without compromise . That there are people who must be dealt with as enemies of the human race . That there are people who have no human heart , and who must be crushed like savage beasts and cleared out of the way . They are but few , I hope ; but I have seen ( in this world here where I find myself , and even at the little Break of Day ) that there are such people . And I do not doubt that this man -- whatever they call him , I forget his name -- is one of them . ’
63613	63622	63624	63625	the landlady	2389	‘ My faith ! If your philosophical philanthropy , ’
63653	63695	63697	63697	she	2389	‘ puts anybody at the mercy of such people by holding terms with them at all , in words or deeds , or both , take it away from the Break of Day , for it is n’t worth a sou . ’
63740	63743	63745	63747	the previous speaker	2419	‘ Well ! ’
63749	63804	63745	63747	the previous speaker	2419	‘ let us come back to our subject . Leaving all that aside , gentlemen , it was because the man was acquitted on his trial that people said at Marseilles that the devil was let loose . That was how the phrase began to circulate , and what it meant ; nothing more . ’
63805	63812	63814	63815	the landlady	2389	‘ How do they call him ? ’
63817	63824	63814	63815	the landlady	2389	‘ Biraud , is it not ? ’
63825	63830	63832	63834	the tall Swiss	2405	‘ Rigaud , madame , ’
63836	63843	63832	63834	the tall Swiss	2405	‘ Rigaud ! To be sure . ’
64008	64017	64004	64004	his	2405	‘ Pardon me , madame -- that Biraud . ’
64018	64023	64039	64040	The landlady	2389	‘ Rigaud , monsieur . ’
64024	64038	64039	64040	The landlady	2389	‘ Rigaud . Pardon me again -- has contracted your displeasure , how ? ’
64103	64126	64094	64094	she	2389	‘ Ay , ay ? Death of my life , that ’s a criminal indeed . But how do you know it ? ’
64127	64134	64094	64094	she	2389	‘ All the world knows it . ’
64135	64144	64094	64094	she	2389	‘ Hah ! And yet he escaped justice ? ’
64145	64191	64094	64094	she	2389	‘ Monsieur , the law could not prove it against him to its satisfaction . So the law says . Nevertheless , all the world knows he did it . The people knew it so well , that they tried to tear him to pieces . ’
64192	64203	64205	64206	the guest	2417	‘ Being all in perfect accord with their own wives ? ’
64208	64211	64205	64206	the guest	2417	‘ Haha ! ’

65186	65219	65220	65221	John Baptist	280	‘ Cavalletto ! Wake , boy ! Rub your eyes and look at me . Not the name you used to call me -- don’t use that -- Lagnier , say Lagnier ! ’
65274	65296	65253	65253	he	280	‘ Cavalletto ! Give me your hand . You know Lagnier , the gentleman . Touch the hand of a gentleman ! ’
65349	65353	65355	65356	John Baptist	280	‘ Then you were-- ’
65358	65367	65369	65369	Lagnier	383	‘ Not shaved ? No . See here ! ’
65377	65385	65369	65369	Lagnier	383	‘ as tight on as your own . ’

65442	65479	65432	65432	he	2473	‘ That ’s a poor trim for a gentleman , you ’ll say . No matter , you shall see how soon I ’ll mend it . Come and sit down . Take your old place ! ’
65507	65512	65514	65514	Lagnier	383	‘ That ’s well ! ’
65516	65537	65514	65514	Lagnier	383	‘ Now we might be in the old infernal hole again , hey ? How long have you been out ? ’
65538	65547	65609	65609	he	383	‘ Two days after you , my master . ’
65548	65555	65609	65609	he	383	‘ How do you come here ? ’
65556	65607	65612	65612	he	383	‘ I was cautioned not to stay there , and so I left the town at once , and since then I have changed about . I have been doing odds and ends at Avignon , at Pont Esprit , at Lyons ; upon the Rhone , upon the Saone . ’
65626	65633	65612	65612	he	383	‘ And where are you going ? ’

65802	65838	65798	65800	the little man	862	‘ Then you shall hear before I sleep -- and in six words , for I want sleep -- how I appear before you , I , Lagnier . Remember that . Not the other . ’

65871	65929	65859	65859	his	2479	‘ Death ! what are you doing ? Do you want me to be trampled upon and stoned ? Do _ you _ want to be trampled upon and stoned ? You would be . You do n’t imagine that they would set upon me , and let my prison chum go ? Do n’t think it ! ’
66005	66011	66013	66014	Monsieur Lagnier	383	‘ I am a man , ’
66016	66226	66013	66014	Monsieur Lagnier	383	‘ whom society has deeply wronged since you last saw me . You know that I am sensitive and brave , and that it is my character to govern . How has society respected those qualities in me ? I have been shrieked at through the streets . I have been guarded through the streets against men , and especially women , running at me armed with any weapons they could lay their hands on . I have lain in prison for security , with the place of my confinement kept a secret , lest I should be torn out of it and felled by a hundred blows . I have been carted out of Marseilles in the dead of night , and carried leagues away from it packed in straw . It has not been safe for me to go near my house ; and , with a beggar ’s pittance in my pocket , I have walked through vile mud and weather ever since , until my feet are crippled -- look at them ! Such are the humiliations that society has inflicted upon me , possessing the qualities I have mentioned , and which you know me to possess . But society shall pay for it . ’

68452	68467	68469	68470	Mrs Plornish	387	‘ It ’s not for want of looking after jobs , I am sure , ’
68492	68518	68474	68474	her	387	‘ nor yet for want of working at them when they are to be got . No one ever heard my husband complain of work . ’

68857	68861	68854	68854	he	304	‘ Miss Dorrit . ’
68862	68879	68908	68908	Plornish	387	‘ Mr Clennam , is it ? Oh ! I ’ve heard of you , Sir . ’
68880	68886	68888	68888	Arthur	304	‘ And I of you , ’
68890	68906	68908	68908	Plornish	387	‘ Please to sit down again , Sir , and consider yourself welcome.--Why , yes , ’
68939	68976	68924	68924	he	2582	‘ I have been on the wrong side of the Lock myself , and in that way we come to know Miss Dorrit . Me and my wife , we are well acquainted with Miss Dorrit . ’

69037	69067	69069	69069	Plornish	387	‘ It was her father that I got acquainted with first . And through getting acquainted with him , you see -- why -- I got acquainted with her , ’
69072	69076	69069	69069	Plornish	387	‘ I see . ’
69077	69111	69113	69113	Plornish	387	‘ Ah ! And there ’s manners ! There ’s polish ! There ’s a gentleman to have run to seed in the Marshalsea jail ! Why , perhaps you are not aware , ’
69135	69157	69159	69159	Plornish	387	‘ not aware that Miss Dorrit and her sister dursn’t let him know that they work for a living . No ! ’
69178	69188	69159	69159	Plornish	387	‘ Dursn’t let him know it , they dursn’t ! ’
69189	69196	69197	69197	Clennam	304	‘ Without admiring him for that , ’
69201	69209	69197	69197	Clennam	304	‘ I am very sorry for him . ’
69250	69255	69256	69256	he	2590	‘ As to me , ’
69259	69301	69256	69256	he	2590	‘ certainly Mr Dorrit is as affable with me , I am sure , as I can possibly expect . Considering the differences and distances betwixt us , more so . But it ’s Miss Dorrit that we were speaking of . ’
69302	69316	69317	69318	Mr Plornish	358	‘ True . Pray how did you introduce her at my mother ’s ! ’
69366	69383	69349	69349	himself	358	‘ Sally , _ you _ may as well mention how it was , old woman . ’
69384	69388	69390	69390	Sally	393	‘ Miss Dorrit , ’
69417	69457	69473	69473	he	358	‘ came here one afternoon with a bit of writing , telling that how she wished for needlework , and asked if it would be considered any ill - conwenience in case she was to give her address here . ’
69481	69497	69499	69499	Plornish	358	‘ Me and Plornish says , No , Miss Dorrit , no ill - conwenience , ’
69508	69528	69530	69530	Plornish	358	‘ and she wrote it in , according . Which then me and Plornish says , Ho Miss Dorrit ! ’
69538	69608	69610	69610	Plornish	358	‘ Have you thought of copying it three or four times , as the way to make it known in more places than one ? No , says Miss Dorrit , I have not , but I will . She copied it out according , on this table , in a sweet writing , and Plornish , he took it where he worked , having a job just then , ’
69617	69641	69642	69642	Plornish	358	‘ and likewise to the landlord of the Yard ; through which it was that Mrs Clennam first happened to employ Miss Dorrit . ’
69672	69679	69681	69682	Arthur Clennam	304	‘ The landlord of the Yard , ’
69684	69686	69681	69682	Arthur Clennam	304	‘ is-- ’
69687	69699	69701	69701	Plornish	387	‘ He is Mr Casby , by name , he is , ’
69703	69714	69716	69717	Mr Plornish	358	‘ and Pancks , he collects the rents . That , ’
69744	69766	69716	69717	Mr Plornish	358	‘ that is about what _ they _ are , you may believe me or not , as you think proper . ’
69767	69770	69776	69776	his	304	‘ Ay ? ’
69779	69794	69776	69776	his	304	‘ Mr Casby , too ! An old acquaintance of mine , long ago ! ’
69920	69948	69893	69893	Plornish	358	‘ Chaunter’--meaning , not a singer of anthems , but a seller of horses -- and that he ( Plornish ) considered that ten shillings in the pound ‘
69953	70290	69893	69893	Plornish	358	’ and that more would be a waste of money . The Principal and instrument soon drove off together to a stable - yard in High Holborn , where a remarkably fine grey gelding , worth , at the lowest figure , seventy - five guineas ( not taking into account the value of the shot he had been made to swallow for the improvement of his form ) , was to be parted with for a twenty - pound note , in consequence of his having run away last week with Mrs Captain Barbary of Cheltenham , who was n’t up to a horse of his courage , and who , in mere spite , insisted on selling him for that ridiculous sum : or , in other words , on giving him away . Plornish , going up this yard alone and leaving his Principal outside , found a gentleman with tight drab legs , a rather old hat , a little hooked stick , and a blue neckerchief ( Captain Maroon of Gloucestershire , a private friend of Captain Barbary ) ; who happened to be there , in a friendly way , to mention these little circumstances concerning the remarkably fine grey gelding to any real judge of a horse and quick snapper - up of a good thing , who might look in at that address as per advertisement . This gentleman , happening also to be the Plaintiff in the Tip case , referred Mr Plornish to his solicitor , and declined to treat with Mr Plornish , or even to endure his presence in the yard , unless he appeared there with a twenty - pound note : in which case only , the gentleman would augur from appearances that he meant business , and might be induced to talk to him . On this hint , Mr Plornish retired to communicate with his Principal , and presently came back with the required credentials . Then said Captain Maroon , ‘
70315	70327	70308	70308	I	0	’ Then said Captain Maroon , when that would n’t suit , ‘
70364	70378	70340	70340	You	2599	’ Then said Captain Maroon , when _ that _ would n’t suit , ‘
70413	70426	70404	70404	I	0	’ Then said Captain Maroon when _ that _ would n’t suit , ‘
70485	70500	70467	70467	you	2599	’ Finally said Captain Maroon , when _ that _ would n’t suit either , ‘
70522	70526	70528	70528	Arthur	304	‘ Mr Plornish , ’
70530	70605	70528	70528	Arthur	304	‘ I trust to you , if you please , to keep my secret . If you will undertake to let the young man know that he is free , and to tell him that you were employed to compound for the debt by some one whom you are not at liberty to name , you will not only do me a service , but may do him one , and his sister also . ’
70606	70613	70615	70615	Plornish	358	‘ The last reason , sir , ’
70617	70630	70615	70615	Plornish	358	‘ would be quite sufficient . Your wishes shall be attended to . ’
70631	70673	70528	70528	Arthur	304	‘ A Friend has obtained his discharge , you can say if you please . A Friend who hopes that for his sister ’s sake , if for no one else ’s , he will make good use of his liberty . ’
70674	70685	70615	70615	Plornish	358	‘ Your wishes , sir , shall be attended to . ’
70686	70742	70615	70615	Plornish	358	‘ And if you will be so good , in your better knowledge of the family , as to communicate freely with me , and to point out to me any means by which you think I may be delicately and really useful to Little Dorrit , I shall feel under an obligation to you . ’
70743	70751	70753	70753	Plornish	358	‘ Do n’t name it , sir , ’
70755	70772	70774	70774	himself	358	‘ it ’ll be ekally a pleasure an a -- it’l be ekally a pleasure and a-- ’

71061	71074	71058	71058	they	2613	‘ Hallo ! I thought you was poor , my improvident friend ! ’
71173	71984	72005	72005	my	0	‘ em and see . There was the girls and their mothers a working at their sewing , or their shoe - binding , or their trimming , or their waistcoat making , day and night and night and day , and not more than able to keep body and soul together after all -- often not so much . There was people of pretty well all sorts of trades you could name , all wanting to work , and yet not able to get it . There was old people , after working all their lives , going and being shut up in the workhouse , much worse fed and lodged and treated altogether , than -- Mr Plornish said manufacturers , but appeared to mean malefactors . Why , a man did n’t know where to turn himself for a crumb of comfort . As to who was to blame for it , Mr Plornish did n’t know who was to blame for it . He could tell you who suffered , but he could n’t tell you whose fault it was . It was n’t _ his _ place to find out , and who ’d mind what he said , if he did find out ? He only know’d that it was n’t put right by them what undertook that line of business , and that it did n’t come right of itself . And , in brief , his illogical opinion was , that if you could n’t do nothing for him , you had better take nothing from him for doing of it ; so far as he could make out , that was about what it come to . Thus , in a prolix , gently - growling , foolish way , did Plornish turn the tangled skein of his estate about and about , like a blind man who was trying to find some beginning or end to it ; until they reached the prison gate . There , he left his Principal alone ; to wonder , as he rode away , how many thousand Plornishes there might be within a day or two ’s journey of the Circumlocution Office , playing sundry curious variations on the same tune , which were not known by ear in that glorious institution . CHAPTER 13 . Patriarchal The mention of Mr Casby again revived in Clennam ’s memory the smouldering embers of curiosity and interest which Mrs Flintwinch had fanned on the night of his arrival . Flora Casby had been the beloved of his boyhood ; and Flora was the daughter and only child of wooden - headed old Christopher ( so he was still occasionally spoken of by some irreverent spirits who had had dealings with him , and in whom familiarity had bred its proverbial result perhaps ) , who was reputed to be rich in weekly tenants , and to get a good quantity of blood out of the stones of several unpromising courts and alleys . After some days of inquiry and research , Arthur Clennam became convinced that the case of the Father of the Marshalsea was indeed a hopeless one , and sorrowfully resigned the idea of helping him to freedom again . He had no hopeful inquiry to make at present , concerning Little Dorrit either ; but he argued with himself that it might -- for anything he knew -- it might be serviceable to the poor child , if he renewed this acquaintance . It is hardly necessary to add that beyond all doubt he would have presented himself at Mr Casby ’s door , if there had been no Little Dorrit in existence ; for we all know how we all deceive ourselves -- that is to say , how people in general , our profounder selves excepted , deceive themselves -- as to motives of action . With a comfortable impression upon him , and quite an honest one in its way , that he was still patronising Little Dorrit in doing what had no reference to her , he found himself one afternoon at the corner of Mr Casby ’s street . Mr Casby lived in a street in the Gray ’s Inn Road , which had set off from that thoroughfare with the intention of running at one heat down into the valley , and up again to the top of Pentonville Hill ; but which had run itself out of breath in twenty yards , and had stood still ever since . There is no such place in that part now ; but it remained there for many years , looking with a baulked countenance at the wilderness patched with unfruitful gardens and pimpled with eruptive summerhouses , that it had meant to run over in no time . ‘
71988	71999	72005	72005	my	0	’ thought Clennam , as he crossed to the door , ‘
72048	72260	72261	72262	Mr Clennam	304	’ When his knock at the bright brass knocker of obsolete shape brought a woman - servant to the door , those faded scents in truth saluted him like wintry breath that had a faint remembrance in it of the bygone spring . He stepped into the sober , silent , air - tight house -- one might have fancied it to have been stifled by Mutes in the Eastern manner -- and the door , closing again , seemed to shut out sound and motion . The furniture was formal , grave , and quaker - like , but well - kept ; and had as prepossessing an aspect as anything , from a human creature to a wooden stool , that is meant for much use and is preserved for little , can ever wear . There was a grave clock , ticking somewhere up the staircase ; and there was a songless bird in the same direction , pecking at his cage , as if he were ticking too . The parlour - fire ticked in the grate . There was only one person on the parlour - hearth , and the loud watch in his pocket ticked audibly . The servant - maid had ticked the two words ‘
72263	72742	72261	72262	Mr Clennam	304	’ so softly that she had not been heard ; and he consequently stood , within the door she had closed , unnoticed . The figure of a man advanced in life , whose smooth grey eyebrows seemed to move to the ticking as the fire - light flickered on them , sat in an arm - chair , with his list shoes on the rug , and his thumbs slowly revolving over one another . This was old Christopher Casby -- recognisable at a glance -- as unchanged in twenty years and upward as his own solid furniture -- as little touched by the influence of the varying seasons as the old rose - leaves and old lavender in his porcelain jars . Perhaps there never was a man , in this troublesome world , so troublesome for the imagination to picture as a boy . And yet he had changed very little in his progress through life . Confronting him , in the room in which he sat , was a boy ’s portrait , which anybody seeing him would have identified as Master Christopher Casby , aged ten : though disguised with a haymaking rake , for which he had had , at any time , as much taste or use as for a diving - bell ; and sitting ( on one of his own legs ) upon a bank of violets , moved to precocious contemplation by the spire of a village church . There was the same smooth face and forehead , the same calm blue eye , the same placid air . The shining bald head , which looked so very large because it shone so much ; and the long grey hair at its sides and back , like floss silk or spun glass , which looked so very benevolent because it was never cut ; were not , of course , to be seen in the boy as in the old man . Nevertheless , in the Seraphic creature with the haymaking rake , were clearly to be discerned the rudiments of the Patriarch with the list shoes . Patriarch was the name which many people delighted to give him . Various old ladies in the neighbourhood spoke of him as The Last of the Patriarchs . So grey , so slow , so quiet , so impassionate , so very bumpy in the head , Patriarch was the word for him . He had been accosted in the streets , and respectfully solicited to become a Patriarch for painters and for sculptors ; with so much importunity , in sooth , that it would appear to be beyond the Fine Arts to remember the points of a Patriarch , or to invent one . Philanthropists of both sexes had asked who he was , and on being informed , ‘
72757	72766	72752	72755	Lord Decimus Tite Barnacle	403	’ had cried in a rapture of disappointment , ‘
72807	72877	72878	72878	I	0	’ With that head , however , he remained old Christopher Casby , proclaimed by common report rich in house property ; and with that head , he now sat in his silent parlour . Indeed it would be the height of unreason to expect him to be sitting there without that head . Arthur Clennam moved to attract his attention , and the grey eyebrows turned towards him . ‘
72883	72887	72878	72878	I	0	’ said Clennam , ‘
72897	72898	72890	72890	you	0	’ ‘

72925	72953	72908	72908	you	0	’ Mr Casby seemed a feather ’s weight disappointed by the last words , having perhaps prepared himself for the visitor ’s wishing to pay something else . ‘
72961	73024	72908	72908	you	0	’ he proceeded--‘take a chair , if you please -- have I the pleasure of knowing-- ? Ah ! truly , yes , I think I have ! I believe I am not mistaken in supposing that I am acquainted with those features ? I think I address a gentleman of whose return to this country I was informed by Mr Flintwinch ? ’
73025	73032	72908	72908	you	0	‘ That is your present visitor . ’
73033	73039	72908	72908	you	0	‘ Really ! Mr Clennam ? ’
73040	73047	72908	72908	you	0	‘ No other , Mr Casby . ’
73048	73067	72908	72908	you	0	‘ Mr Clennam , I am glad to see you . How have you been since we met ? ’
73121	73124	73156	73156	Clennam	304	‘ that head ’
73134	73142	73144	73145	Christopher Casby	395	‘ We are older , Mr Clennam , ’

73180	73186	73188	73189	Mr Casby	395	‘ And your respected father , ’
73191	73210	73188	73189	Mr Casby	395	‘ is no more ! I was grieved to hear it , Mr Clennam , I was grieved . ’
73225	73231	73233	73234	Mr Casby	395	‘ There was a time , ’
73236	73285	73233	73234	Mr Casby	395	‘ when your parents and myself were not on friendly terms . There was a little family misunderstanding among us . Your respected mother was rather jealous of her son , maybe ; when I say her son , I mean your worthy self , your worthy self . ’
73371	73377	73362	73362	they	2640	‘ Those times , however , ’
73382	73427	73379	73380	Mr Casby	395	‘ are past and gone , past and gone . I do myself the pleasure of making a visit to your respected mother occasionally , and of admiring the fortitude and strength of mind with which she bears her trials , bears her trials . ’
73504	73519	73521	73521	Arthur	304	‘ I have heard that you were kind enough on one of those occasions , ’
73533	73542	73521	73521	Arthur	304	‘ to mention Little Dorrit to my mother . ’
73543	73587	73521	73521	Arthur	304	‘ Little-- ? Dorrit ? That ’s the seamstress who was mentioned to me by a small tenant of mine ? Yes , yes . Dorrit ? That ’s the name . Ah , yes , yes ! You call her Little Dorrit ? ’
73607	73612	73614	73615	Mr Casby	395	‘ My daughter Flora , ’
73617	73684	73614	73615	Mr Casby	395	‘ as you may have heard probably , Mr Clennam , was married and established in life , several years ago . She had the misfortune to lose her husband when she had been married a few months . She resides with me again . She will be glad to see you , if you will permit me to let her know that you are here . ’
73685	73690	73692	73692	Clennam	304	‘ By all means , ’
73694	73710	73692	73692	Clennam	304	‘ I should have preferred the request , if your kindness had not anticipated me . ’
73859	73862	73863	73863	he	2644	‘ Halloa ! ’
73875	73878	73863	73863	he	2644	‘ Halloa ! ’

75984	76011	75962	75962	they	2697	’ Flora gave him another of her old glances . Instantly she went on again , as if he had spoken in reply for some time . ‘
76116	76140	76141	76142	Dear dear	2704	’ In his ridiculous distress , Clennam received another of the old glances without in the least knowing what to do with it . ‘
76144	76148	76141	76142	Dear dear	2704	’ said Flora , ‘
76262	76263	76252	76253	Mrs Finching	410	’ ‘
76270	76315	76316	76316	Finching	410	’ asked Arthur , struck , in the midst of all this , by a certain warmth of heart that expressed itself in her tone when she referred , however oddly , to the youthful relation in which they had stood to one another . ‘
76318	76319	76316	76316	Finching	410	’ ‘
76392	76446	76378	76378	he	411	’ Flora had at last talked herself out of breath for one moment . One moment ; for she recovered breath in the act of raising a minute corner of her pocket - handkerchief to her eye , as a tribute to the ghost of the departed Mr F. , and began again . ‘
76511	76512	76513	76513	My	0	’ ‘
76518	76529	76513	76513	My	0	’ Arthur began , struck by the good tone again . ‘

76591	76592	76593	76593	You	304	’ ‘
76599	76603	76604	76604	you	304	’ pouted Flora , ‘

76656	76660	76628	76628	you	304	’ Clennam entreated , ‘

76674	76683	76669	76669	I	0	’ said Flora , in a positive tone , ‘
76704	76767	76698	76698	I	0	’ In the midst of her rapidity , she had found that out with the quick perception of a cleverer woman . The inconsistent and profoundly unreasonable way in which she instantly went on , nevertheless , to interweave their long - abandoned boy and girl relations with their present interview , made Clennam feel as if he were light - headed . ‘
76771	76799	76800	76800	I	0	’ said Flora , giving their conversation , without the slightest notice and to the great terror of Clennam , the tone of a love - quarrel , ‘
76864	76865	76868	76869	Mrs Finching	410	’ ‘
76871	76888	76868	76869	Mrs Finching	410	’ urged Clennam--‘all so long ago and so long concluded , is it worth while seriously to-- ’
76889	76895	76897	76897	Flora	499	‘ I ca n’t Arthur , ’
76899	77000	76897	76897	Flora	499	‘ be denounced as heartless by the whole society of China without setting myself right when I have the opportunity of doing so , and you must be very well aware that there was Paul and Virginia which had to be returned and which was returned without note or comment , not that I mean to say you could have written to me watched as I was but if it had only come back with a red wafer on the cover I should have known that it meant Come to Pekin Nankeen and What ’s the third place , barefoot . ’
77001	77042	77045	77045	Arthur	304	‘ My dear Mrs Finching , you were not to blame , and I never blamed you . We were both too young , too dependent and helpless , to do anything but accept our separation.--Pray think how long ago , ’
77047	77052	77054	77054	Flora	499	‘ One more remark , ’
77059	77199	77054	77054	Flora	499	‘ I wish to make , one more explanation I wish to offer , for five days I had a cold in the head from crying which I passed entirely in the back drawing - room -- there is the back drawing - room still on the first floor and still at the back of the house to confirm my words -- when that dreary period had passed a lull succeeded years rolled on and Mr F. became acquainted with us at a mutual friend ’s , he was all attention he called next day he soon began to call three evenings a week and to send in little things for supper it was not love on Mr F. ’s part it was adoration , Mr F. proposed with the full approval of Papa and what could I do ? ’
77200	77204	77206	77206	Arthur	304	‘ Nothing whatever , ’
77213	77235	77206	77206	Arthur	304	‘ but what you did . Let an old friend assure you of his full conviction that you did quite right . ’
77236	77241	77243	77243	Flora	499	‘ One last remark , ’
77255	77335	77243	77243	Flora	499	‘ I wish to make , one last explanation I wish to offer , there _ was _ a time ere Mr F. first paid attentions incapable of being mistaken , but that is past and was not to be , dear Mr Clennam you no longer wear a golden chain you are free I trust you may be happy , here is Papa who is always tiresome and putting in his nose everywhere where he is not wanted . ’
77700	77703	77698	77698	Flora	499	‘ Yes ! ’
77829	77834	77836	77836	Pancks	396	‘ Bleeding Heart Yard ? ’
77845	77884	77836	77836	Pancks	396	‘ It ’s a troublesome property . Do n’t pay you badly , but rents are very hard to get there . You have more trouble with that one place than with all the places belonging to you . ’
77921	77924	77945	77945	he	304	‘ Indeed ? ’
77954	77962	77945	77945	he	304	‘ The people are so poor there ? ’
77963	77974	77976	77976	Pancks	396	‘ _ You _ ca n’t say , you know , ’
78013	78016	78005	78005	his	396	‘ whether they ’re
78041	78076	78040	78040	you	2742	’re generally sure he is n’t . Besides , if they _ are _ poor , you ca n’t help it . You ’d be poor yourself if you did n’t get your rents . ’
78077	78081	78083	78083	Arthur	304	‘ True enough , ’
78085	78087	78040	78040	you	2742	‘ You ’re
78101	78105	78106	78106	You	2742	’ pursued Pancks . ‘
78107	78112	78106	78106	You	2742	’re not going to lodge ‘
78118	78128	78106	78106	You	2742	’re not going to open your gates wide and let ‘
78143	78156	78139	78139	you	2742	’ Mr Casby shook his head , in Placid and benignant generality . ‘
78269	78302	78303	78303	You	2742	’ Mr Pancks here made a singular and startling noise , produced by a strong blowing effort in the region of the nose , unattended by any result but that acoustic one . ‘
78322	78334	78319	78319	I	0	’ said Clennam , doubtful which of the two to address . ‘
78340	78344	78345	78345	You	2742	’ said Pancks . ‘
78346	78398	78345	78345	You	2742	’re not particular to east or north - east , any point of the compass will do for you . What you want is a good investment and a quick return . You take it where you can find it . You ai n’t nice as to situation -- not you . ’
78688	78694	78682	78682	her	499	‘ Mr F. ’s Aunt . ’
78867	78882	78883	78884	Mr Pancks	396	‘ When we lived at Henley , Barnes ’s gander was stole by tinkers . ’
78892	78898	78887	78887	his	396	‘ All right , ma’am . ’
78981	78992	78976	78977	No man	9779	‘ Mr F. ’s Aunt , will you permit me ? ’
79350	79368	79345	79345	Flora	499	‘ Mr Clennam , will you give me a glass of port for Mr F. ’s Aunt ? ’
79369	79376	79377	79378	that lady	2783	‘ The Monument near London Bridge , ’
79382	79414	79377	79378	that lady	2783	‘ was put up arter the Great Fire of London ; and the Great Fire of London was not the fire in which your uncle George ’s workshops was burned down . ’
79425	79433	79415	79416	Mr Pancks	396	‘ Indeed , ma’am ? All right ! ’
79466	79472	79473	79473	She	2757	‘ I hate a fool ! ’
79537	79546	79533	79533	her	2757	‘ What he come there for , then ? ’
79574	79676	79555	79555	she	499	‘ took dislikes’--peculiarities of which Flora seemed to be proud rather than otherwise . As Flora ’s good nature shone in the case , Clennam had no fault to find with the old lady for eliciting it , now that he was relieved from the terrors of her presence ; and they took a glass or two of wine in peace . Foreseeing then that the Pancks would shortly get under weigh , and that the Patriarch would go to sleep , he pleaded the necessity of visiting his mother , and asked Mr Pancks in which direction he was going ? ‘
79681	79685	79679	79679	sir	933	’ said Pancks . ‘
79691	79695	79555	79555	she	499	’ said Arthur . ‘
79699	79969	79555	79555	she	499	’ said Pancks . Meanwhile Flora was murmuring in rapid snatches for his ear , that there was a time and that the past was a yawning gulf however and that a golden chain no longer bound him and that she revered the memory of the late Mr F. and that she should be at home to - morrow at half - past one and that the decrees of Fate were beyond recall and that she considered nothing so improbable as that he ever walked on the north - west side of Gray’s - Inn Gardens at exactly four o’clock in the afternoon . He tried at parting to give his hand in frankness to the existing Flora -- not the vanished Flora , or the mermaid -- but Flora would n’t have it , could n’t have it , was wholly destitute of the power of separating herself and him from their bygone characters . He left the house miserably enough ; and so much more light - headed than ever , that if it had not been his good fortune to be towed away , he might , for the first quarter of an hour , have drifted anywhere . When he began to come to himself , in the cooler air and the absence of Flora , he found Pancks at full speed , cropping such scanty pasturage of nails as he could find , and snorting at intervals . These , in conjunction with one hand in his pocket and his roughened hat hind side before , were evidently the conditions under which he reflected . ‘
79974	79978	79555	79555	she	499	’ said Arthur . ‘
79986	79990	79555	79555	she	499	’ assented Pancks . ‘
80017	80018	80019	80019	You	0	’ ‘
80026	80027	80019	80019	You	0	’ ‘

80062	80070	80054	80054	Pancks	396	‘ What ’s a man made for ? ’
80071	80076	80078	80078	Clennam	304	‘ For nothing else ? ’
80086	80090	80080	80080	Pancks	396	‘ What else ? ’
80116	80126	80128	80128	Pancks	396	‘ That ’s what I ask our weekly tenants , ’
80130	80133	80128	80128	Pancks	396	‘ Some of ‘
80154	80165	80147	80147	you	304	’re always grinding , drudging , toiling , every minute we ’re
80204	80205	80211	80211	dear	971	’ ‘
80213	80217	80211	80211	dear	971	’ sighed Clennam . ‘
80222	80234	80220	80220	I	0	’ said Pancks , pursuing his argument with the weekly tenant . ‘
80318	80332	80308	80316	the Whole Duty of Man in a commercial country	2801	’ When they had walked a little further in silence , Clennam said : ‘
80343	80344	80334	80334	you	0	’ ‘
80349	80354	80356	80356	us	2803	’ drily retorted Pancks . ‘
80360	80361	80356	80356	us	2803	’ ‘
80372	80376	80370	80370	sir	933	’ said Pancks , ‘
80384	80461	80378	80378	you	933	’ He blew off that sound again , and it occurred to his companion for the first time that it was his way of laughing . He was a singular man in all respects ; he might not have been quite in earnest , but that the short , hard , rapid manner in which he shot out these cinders of principles , as if it were done by mechanical revolvency , seemed irreconcilable with banter . ‘
80471	80475	80468	80468	I	0	’ said Clennam . ‘
80509	80520	80539	80539	your	0	’re not of the Clennams of Cornwall , Mr Clennam ? ’
80521	80529	80539	80539	your	0	‘ Not that I ever heard of . ’
80530	80534	80508	80508	You	0	‘ I know you ’re

80568	80569	80544	80544	She	9883	’ ‘

80622	80641	80642	80642	I	0	’ said Pancks , taking his note - book from his breast pocket and putting it in again . ‘
80653	80654	80647	80647	I	0	’ ‘
80658	80923	80647	80647	I	0	’ said Clennam . But the Tug , suddenly lightened , and untrammelled by having any weight in tow , was already puffing away into the distance . They had crossed Smithfield together , and Clennam was left alone at the corner of Barbican . He had no intention of presenting himself in his mother ’s dismal room that night , and could not have felt more depressed and cast away if he had been in a wilderness . He turned slowly down Aldersgate Street , and was pondering his way along towards Saint Paul ’s , purposing to come into one of the great thoroughfares for the sake of their light and life , when a crowd of people flocked towards him on the same pavement , and he stood aside against a shop to let them pass . As they came up , he made out that they were gathered around a something that was carried on men ’s shoulders . He soon saw that it was a litter , hastily made of a shutter or some such thing ; and a recumbent figure upon it , and the scraps of conversation in the crowd , and a muddy bundle carried by one man , and a muddy hat carried by another , informed him that an accident had occurred . The litter stopped under a lamp before it had passed him half - a - dozen paces , for some readjustment of the burden ; and , the crowd stopping too , he found himself in the midst of the array . ‘
80931	80949	80960	80960	them	2814	’ he asked an old man beside him , who stood shaking his head , inviting conversation . ‘
80952	80957	80960	80960	them	2814	’ said the man , ‘
81012	81013	81003	81003	people	822	’ ‘
81023	81024	81020	81020	I	0	’ ‘
81030	81035	81025	81025	I	0	’ said the man , ‘
81052	81100	81101	81101	They	2814	’ The speaker having folded his arms , and set in comfortably to address his depreciation of them Mails to any of the bystanders who would listen , several voices , out of pure sympathy with the sufferer , confirmed him ; one voice saying to Clennam , ‘
81102	81112	81025	81025	I	0	’re a public nuisance , them Mails , sir ; ’
81115	81122	81025	81025	I	0	‘ _ I _ see one on ‘
81137	81140	81142	81142	I	0	’ another , ‘

81194	81218	81220	81223	the first old man	2819	‘ Why , a native Englishman is put to it every night of his life , to save his life from them Mails , ’
81225	81233	81220	81223	the first old man	2819	‘ and _ he _ knows when they ’re
81261	81264	81249	81249	you	2820	‘ em ! ’
81265	81271	81273	81273	Clennam	304	‘ Is this a foreigner ? ’
81287	81292	81273	81273	Clennam	304	‘ Frenchman , sir , ’
81293	81298	81249	81249	you	2820	‘ Porteghee , sir , ’
81299	81304	81273	81273	Clennam	304	‘ Dutchman , sir , ’
81305	81310	81249	81249	you	2820	‘ Prooshan , sir , ’
81344	81363	81364	81364	Clennam	304	‘ Ah , poor fellow , he says he ’ll never get over it ; and no wonder ! ’
81392	81400	81402	81402	he	304	‘ First , he wants some water , ’
81418	81427	81428	81428	he	304	‘ Are you badly hurt , my friend ? ’
81439	81476	81428	81428	he	304	‘ Yes , sir ; yes , yes , yes . It ’s my leg , it ’s my leg . But it pleases me to hear the old music , though I am very bad . ’
81477	81496	81428	81428	he	304	‘ You are a traveller ! Stay ! See , the water ! Let me give you some . ’
81568	81578	81665	81665	he	304	‘ That ’s well . You are a traveller ? ’
81579	81584	81665	81665	he	304	‘ Surely , sir . ’
81585	81592	81665	81665	he	304	‘ A stranger in this city ? ’
81593	81607	81665	81665	he	304	‘ Surely , surely , altogether . I am arrived this unhappy evening . ’
81608	81613	81665	81665	he	304	‘ From what country ? ’
81614	81617	81665	81665	he	304	‘ Marseilles . ’
81618	81655	81656	81657	The face	2826	‘ Why , see there ! I also ! Almost as much a stranger here as you , though born here , I came from Marseilles a little while ago . Do n’t be cast down . ’
81682	81710	81665	81665	he	304	‘ I wo n’t leave you till you shall be well taken care of . Courage ! You will be very much better half an hour hence . ’
81711	81718	81720	81723	the poor little man	2828	‘ Ah ! Altro , Altro ! ’
81835	81843	81845	81845	Clennam	304	‘ He hardly knows an English word , ’
81847	81853	81845	81845	Clennam	304	‘ is he badly hurt ? ’
81854	81863	81865	81866	the surgeon	2835	‘ Let us know all about it first , ’
81878	81883	81865	81866	the surgeon	2835	‘ before we pronounce . ’
81950	81981	81936	81937	the surgeon	2835	‘ He wo n’t hurt . He ’ll do very well . It ’s difficult enough , but we shall not want him to part with his leg this time . ’
82015	82025	82027	82027	Clennam	304	‘ It ’s a serious injury , I suppose ? ’
82029	82034	82036	82037	the surgeon	2835	‘ Ye - es , ’
82053	82082	82083	82083	He	2835	‘ Yes , it ’s enough . There ’s a compound fracture above the knee , and a dislocation below . They are both of a beautiful kind . ’
82126	82131	82133	82134	the surgeon	2835	‘ He speaks French ? ’
82136	82144	82133	82134	the surgeon	2835	‘ Oh yes , he speaks French . ’
82145	82183	82184	82184	he	2835	‘ He ’ll be at no loss here , then.--You have only to bear a little pain like a brave fellow , my friend , and to be thankful that all goes as well as it does , ’
82191	82220	82184	82184	he	2835	‘ and you ’ll walk again to a marvel . Now , let us see whether there ’s anything else the matter , and how our ribs are ? ’
82971	82986	82937	82937	He	304	‘ How soon I too shall pass through such changes , and be gone ! ’
83023	83076	83078	83079	Arthur Clennam	304	‘ From the unhappy suppression of my youngest days , through the rigid and unloving home that followed them , through my departure , my long exile , my return , my mother ’s welcome , my intercourse with her since , down to the afternoon of this day with poor Flora , ’

83543	83566	83507	83507	he	2883	‘ I said Little Dorrit , sir , on purpose to prepare you . I knew you must be very much surprised . ’

83665	83672	83650	83650	himself	304	‘ And it is so cold . ’
83709	83719	83720	83720	he	304	‘ Your foot is like marble , my child ; ’
83740	83747	83720	83720	he	304	‘ put it nearer the warmth . ’
83823	83845	83819	83819	he	304	‘ why did he dine to - day , and leave this little creature to the mercy of the cold stones ! ’
83889	83896	83897	83898	Little Dorrit	274	‘ Before I say anything else , ’
83949	83958	83929	83929	she	274	‘ may I tell you something , sir ? ’
83959	83965	83976	83976	his	766	‘ Yes , my child . ’
84006	84057	84002	84002	he	766	‘ I wanted a tender word , and could think of no other . As you just now gave yourself the name they give you at my mother ’s , and as that is the name by which I always think of you , let me call you Little Dorrit . ’
84058	84073	84002	84002	he	766	‘ Thank you , sir , I should like it better than any name . ’
84074	84078	84002	84002	he	766	‘ Little Dorrit . ’
84079	84083	84002	84002	he	766	‘ Little mother , ’
84099	84108	84002	84002	he	766	‘ It ’s all the same , Maggy , ’
84113	84118	84002	84002	he	766	‘ all the same . ’
84119	84128	84002	84002	he	766	‘ Is it all the same , mother ? ’
84129	84134	84135	84135	Maggy	358	‘ Just the same . ’
84232	84243	84245	84246	Little Dorrit	274	‘ What I was going to tell you , sir , ’
84248	84258	84245	84246	Little Dorrit	274	‘ is , that my brother is at large . ’
84273	84285	84287	84288	Little Dorrit	274	‘ And what I was going to tell you , sir , ’
84301	84340	84298	84298	her	274	‘ is , that I am not to know whose generosity released him -- am never to ask , and am never to be told , and am never to thank that gentleman with all my grateful heart ! ’
84387	84400	84402	84403	Little Dorrit	274	‘ And what I was going to say , sir , is , ’
84410	84576	84402	84403	Little Dorrit	274	‘ that if I knew him , and I might , I would tell him that he can never , never know how I feel his goodness , and how my good father would feel it . And what I was going to say , sir , is , that if I knew him , and I might -- but I do n’t know him and I must not -- I know that!--I would tell him that I shall never any more lie down to sleep without having prayed to Heaven to bless him and reward him . And if I knew him , and I might , I would go down on my knees to him , and take his hand and kiss it and ask him not to draw it away , but to leave it -- O to leave it for a moment -- and let my thankful tears fall on it ; for I have no other thanks to give him ! ’
84639	84730	84731	84731	child	1881	‘ There , Little Dorrit , there , there , there ! We will suppose that you did know this person , and that you might do all this , and that it was all done . And now tell me , Who am quite another person -- who am nothing more than the friend who begged you to trust him -- why you are out at midnight , and what it is that brings you so far through the streets at this late hour , my slight , delicate , ’
84738	84742	84734	84734	his	2896	‘ Little Dorrit ! ’
84743	84753	84754	84754	she	2898	‘ Maggy and I have been to - night , ’
84771	84781	84754	84754	she	2898	‘ to the theatre where my sister is engaged . ’
84782	84792	84795	84795	Maggy	358	‘ And oh ai n’t it a Ev’nly place , ’
84814	84831	84795	84795	Maggy	358	‘ Almost as good as a hospital . Only there ai n’t no Chicking in it . ’
84842	84847	84849	84850	Little Dorrit	274	‘ We went there , ’
84857	84951	84849	84850	Little Dorrit	274	‘ because I like sometimes to know , of my own knowledge , that my sister is doing well ; and like to see her there , with my own eyes , when neither she nor Uncle is aware . It is very seldom indeed that I can do that , because when I am not out at work , I am with my father , and even when I am out at work , I hurry home to him . But I pretend to - night that I am at a party . ’
84980	84996	84997	84997	She	274	‘ Oh no , certainly ! I never was at a party in my life . ’
85010	85037	84997	84997	She	274	‘ I hope there is no harm in it . I could never have been of any use , if I had not pretended a little . ’
85183	85190	85172	85172	she	274	‘ It is the first night , ’
85195	85218	85172	85172	she	274	‘ that I have ever been away from home . And London looks so large , so barren , and so wild . ’
85245	85251	85252	85252	she	274	‘ But this is not , ’
85261	85328	85252	85252	she	274	‘ what I have come to trouble you with , sir . My sister ’s having found a friend , a lady she has told me of and made me rather anxious about , was the first cause of my coming away from home . And being away , and coming ( on purpose ) round by where you lived and seeing a light in the window-- ’
85407	85413	85415	85416	Little Dorrit	274	‘ There were three things , ’
85418	85455	85415	85416	Little Dorrit	274	‘ that I thought I would like to say , if you were alone and I might come up - stairs . First , what I have tried to say , but never can -- never shall-- ’
85456	85477	85479	85479	Clennam	304	‘ Hush , hush ! That is done with , and disposed of . Let us pass to the second , ’
85506	85510	85512	85513	Little Dorrit--‘this	423	‘ I think , ’
85552	85553	85549	85549	I	0	’ ‘
85556	85574	85575	85575	I	0	’ returned Clennam quickly . He asked her , after short consideration , why she supposed so . ‘
85578	85583	85575	85575	I	0	’ replied Little Dorrit , ‘
85592	85622	85585	85586	Mr Flintwinch	320	’ And why , Clennam asked , as he turned his eyes upon the fire , bent his brows , and considered again ; why did she suppose that ? ‘
85672	85673	85665	85665	he	320	’ ‘
85679	85680	85675	85675	he	320	’ ‘
85694	85695	85683	85683	he	320	’ ‘
85702	85712	85696	85697	The devil	10854	’ mused Clennam , still looking at the fire ; ‘
85720	85761	85696	85697	The devil	10854	’ He roused himself to persuade her to put some wine to her lips , and to touch something to eat -- it was very difficult , she was so timid and shy -- and then said , musing again : ‘
85771	85772	85696	85697	The devil	10854	’ ‘
85817	85841	85843	85843	you	0	’ said Little Dorrit , looking at him in a suppliant way , and gradually withdrawing her eyes as he looked at her , ‘
85853	85854	85843	85843	you	0	’ ‘
85858	85894	85855	85856	Little Dorrit	274	’ said Clennam ; and the phrase had already begun , between these two , to stand for a hundred gentle phrases , according to the varying tone and connection in which it was used ; ‘
85935	85936	85928	85928	I	0	’ ‘
85947	85961	85963	85963	thirsty.--I	2912	’ said Little Dorrit , as he softly put her glass towards her , ‘
85972	85973	85974	85974	We	2913	’ ‘
85987	85991	85974	85974	We	2913	’ said Clennam : ‘
86006	86007	85974	85974	We	2913	’ ‘
86018	86019	86020	86020	I	0	’ ‘
86026	86027	86020	86020	I	0	’ ‘
86051	86062	86049	86049	me	0	’ said Little Dorrit , with returning and increasing agitation . ‘
86097	86098	86100	86100	you	0	’ ‘
86112	86113	86102	86102	You	0	’ ‘
86116	86117	86102	86102	You	0	’ ‘
86141	86142	86118	86118	You	0	’ ‘
86151	86152	86118	86118	You	0	’ ‘
86157	86189	86154	86154	you	933	’ said Little Dorrit , folding her small hands tight in one another , and looking at him with all the earnestness of her soul looking steadily out of her eyes , ‘
86201	86202	86191	86191	I	0	’ ‘
86214	86215	86209	86209	I	0	’ ‘
86223	86232	86218	86218	you	933	’ said Little Dorrit , shaking her head . ‘
86258	86259	86252	86252	me	0	’ ‘
86264	86265	86260	86260	I	0	’ ‘
86307	86333	86334	86334	You	933	’ Clennam said -- not very plainly , seeing those tears glistening in her anxious eyes -- that her wish should be sacred with him . ‘
86342	86346	86347	86347	you	933	’ she said ; ‘
86416	86428	86409	86409	I	0	’ cried Little Dorrit , covering her tears with her hands , ‘
86451	86452	86436	86436	you	933	’ ‘
86455	86459	86436	86436	you	933	’ said Clennam , ‘
86479	86480	86482	86482	you	933	’ ‘
86540	86547	86534	86534	I	0	’ she dried her tears quickly , ‘
86569	86656	86534	86534	I	0	’ Relieved of this weight , Little Dorrit was nervously anxious to be gone . Maggy being broad awake , and in the act of distantly gloating over the fruit and cakes with chuckles of anticipation , Clennam made the best diversion in his power by pouring her out a glass of wine , which she drank in a series of loud smacks ; putting her hand upon her windpipe after every one , and saying , breathless , with her eyes in a prominent state , ‘
86669	86746	86534	86534	I	0	’ When she had finished the wine and these encomiums , he charged her to load her basket ( she was never without her basket ) with every eatable thing upon the table , and to take especial care to leave no scrap behind . Maggy ’s pleasure in doing this and her little mother ’s pleasure in seeing Maggy pleased , was as good a turn as circumstances could have given to the late conversation . ‘
86757	86765	86534	86534	I	0	’ said Clennam , suddenly remembering it . ‘
86771	86772	86768	86768	you	2925	’ ‘
86781	86786	86773	86773	I	0	’ answered Little Dorrit . ‘
86799	86800	86801	86801	I	0	’ ‘
86807	86811	86801	86801	I	0	’ said Clennam , ‘
86820	86821	86812	86812	I	0	’ ‘
86836	86878	86904	86904	Maggy	358	’ begged Little Dorrit . She was so earnest in the petition , that Clennam felt a delicacy in obtruding himself upon her : the rather , because he could well understand that Maggy ’s lodging was of the obscurest sort . ‘
86883	86889	86881	86881	Maggy	358	’ said Little Dorrit cheerily , ‘
86906	86907	86904	86904	Maggy	358	’ ‘
86920	86938	86915	86915	we	2928	’ chuckled Maggy . And away they went . Little Dorrit turned at the door to say , ‘
86943	87197	86941	86941	you	358	’ She said it very softly , but perhaps she may have been as audible above -- who knows!--as a whole cathedral choir . Arthur Clennam suffered them to pass the corner of the street before he followed at a distance ; not with any idea of encroaching a second time on Little Dorrit ’s privacy , but to satisfy his mind by seeing her secure in the neighbourhood to which she was accustomed . So diminutive she looked , so fragile and defenceless against the bleak damp weather , flitting along in the shuffling shadow of her charge , that he felt , in his compassion , and in his habit of considering her a child apart from the rest of the rough world , as if he would have been glad to take her up in his arms and carry her to her journey ’s end . In course of time she came into the leading thoroughfare where the Marshalsea was , and then he saw them slacken their pace , and soon turn down a by - street . He stopped , felt that he had no right to go further , and slowly left them . He had no suspicion that they ran any risk of being houseless until morning ; had no idea of the truth until long , long afterwards . But , said Little Dorrit , when they stopped at a poor dwelling all in darkness , and heard no sound on listening at the door , ‘
87246	87279	87280	87280	Maggy	358	’ Once , Little Dorrit knocked with a careful hand , and listened . Twice , Little Dorrit knocked with a careful hand , and listened . All was close and still . ‘
87303	87337	87293	87293	We	2933	’ It was a chill dark night , with a damp wind blowing , when they came out into the leading street again , and heard the clocks strike half - past one . ‘
87346	87351	87293	87293	We	2933	’ said Little Dorrit , ‘
87360	87400	87401	87401	I	0	’ To speak of home , and to go and look at it , it being so near , was a natural sequence . They went to the closed gate , and peeped through into the court - yard . ‘
87408	87419	87401	87401	I	0	’ said Little Dorrit , kissing one of the bars , ‘
87426	87507	87508	87508	Maggy	358	’ The gate was so familiar , and so like a companion , that they put down Maggy ’s basket in a corner to serve for a seat , and keeping close together , rested there for some time . While the street was empty and silent , Little Dorrit was not afraid ; but when she heard a footstep at a distance , or saw a moving shadow among the street lamps , she was startled , and whispered , ‘
87518	87577	87508	87508	Maggy	358	’ Maggy would then wake up more or less fretfully , and they would wander about a little , and come back again . As long as eating was a novelty and an amusement , Maggy kept up pretty well . But that period going by , she became querulous about the cold , and shivered and whimpered . ‘
87586	87592	87584	87584	dear	971	’ said Little Dorrit patiently . ‘
87605	87609	87602	87603	little mother	10683	’ returned Maggy , ‘
87612	87622	87584	87584	dear	971	’m a poor thing , only ten years old . ’
87698	87706	87707	87707	she	971	‘ If it really was a party ! ’
87716	87783	87707	87707	she	971	‘ If it was light and warm and beautiful , and it was our house , and my poor dear was its master , and had never been inside these walls . And if Mr Clennam was one of our visitors , and we were dancing to delightful music , and were all as gay and light - hearted as ever we could be ! I wonder-- ’
87990	88000	88043	88044	a woman	10865	‘ let the woman and the child go by ! ’
88049	88058	88059	88059	she	10865	‘ What are you doing with the child ? ’
88104	88112	88114	88114	Maggy	358	‘ What are you doing with yourself ? ’
88123	88134	88114	88114	Maggy	358	‘ Ca n’t you see , without my telling you ? ’
88135	88144	88146	88146	Maggy	358	‘ I do n’t know as I can , ’
88148	88169	88146	88146	Maggy	358	‘ Killing myself ! Now I have answered you , answer me . What are you doing with the child ? ’
88189	88193	88195	88196	the woman	11264	‘ Poor thing ! ’
88198	88267	88195	88196	the woman	11264	‘ Have you no feeling , that you keep her out in the cruel streets at such a time as this ? Have you no eyes , that you do n’t see how delicate and slender she is ? Have you no sense ( you do n’t look as if you had much ) that you do n’t take more pity on this cold and trembling little hand ? ’
88288	88297	88298	88298	she	11264	‘ Kiss a poor lost creature , dear , ’
88305	88315	88298	88298	she	11264	‘ and tell me where ’s she taking you . ’
88322	88328	88329	88329	she	274	‘ Why , my God ! ’
88334	88336	88329	88329	she	274	‘ you ’re
88340	88341	88329	88329	she	274	’ ‘
88347	88363	88329	88329	she	274	’ said Little Dorrit , clasping one of her hands that had suddenly released hers . ‘
88371	88372	88364	88364	I	0	’ ‘
88379	88383	88374	88374	you	11264	’ she answered . ‘
88389	88390	88386	88387	no mother	2961	’ ‘
88393	88394	88395	88396	No father	2962	’ ‘
88398	88399	88402	88405	a very dear one	2963	’ ‘
88407	88408	88402	88405	a very dear one	2963	’ ‘
88427	88428	88429	88429	I	0	’ ‘

88456	88461	88450	88450	You	11264	’ said the woman . ‘
88498	88676	88495	88496	a child	1032	’ And with a strange , wild cry , she went away . No day yet in the sky , but there was day in the resounding stones of the streets ; in the waggons , carts , and coaches ; in the workers going to various occupations ; in the opening of early shops ; in the traffic at markets ; in the stir of the riverside . There was coming day in the flaring lights , with a feebler colour in them than they would have had at another time ; coming day in the increased sharpness of the air , and the ghastly dying of the night . They went back again to the gate , intending to wait there now until it should be opened ; but the air was so raw and cold that Little Dorrit , leading Maggy about in her sleep , kept in motion . Going round by the Church , she saw lights there , and the door open ; and went up the steps and looked in . ‘
88681	88705	88495	88496	a child	1032	’ cried a stout old man , who was putting on a nightcap as if he were going to bed in a vault . ‘
88714	88719	88495	88496	a child	1032	’ said Little Dorrit . ‘
88722	88727	88495	88496	a child	1032	’ cried the man . ‘
88736	88761	88762	88762	I	0	’ This caused her to turn back again in the act of going out , and to present herself and her charge before him . ‘
88766	88770	88762	88762	I	0	’ said he . ‘
88777	88778	88762	88762	I	0	’ ‘
88786	88808	88779	88779	We	2971	’ said Little Dorrit , recognising the sexton , or the beadle , or the verger , or whatever he was , ‘
88817	88818	88779	88779	We	2971	’ ‘
88836	88842	88835	88835	you	2970	’re one of our curiosities . ’
88843	88846	88848	88849	Little Dorrit	274	‘ Indeed ! ’
88851	88876	88848	88849	Little Dorrit	274	‘ To be sure . As the child of the -- by - the - bye , how did you get out so early ? ’
88877	88892	88835	88835	you	2970	‘ We were shut out last night , and are waiting to get in . ’
88893	88929	88848	88849	Little Dorrit	274	‘ You do n’t mean it ? And there ’s another hour good yet ! Come into the vestry . You ’ll find a fire in the vestry , on account of the painters . I ’m
88972	89005	89010	89010	you	2970	’ He was a very good old fellow , in his familiar way ; and having stirred the vestry fire , he looked round the shelves of registers for a particular volume . ‘
89013	89025	89007	89007	you	2970	’ he said , taking it down and turning the leaves . ‘
89086	89087	89037	89037	Amy	349	’ ‘
89095	89096	89097	89097	Lord	2982	’ ‘
89099	89117	89097	89097	Lord	2982	’ But his surveying her with an admiring gaze suggested Something else to him , to wit : ‘
89183	89198	89177	89177	I	0	’ He soon brought in the cushions , and strewed them on the ground . ‘
89308	89331	89342	89342	he	0	‘ em , but who isn’t -- who ’s coming , you know , and when . That ’s the interesting question . ’
90533	90541	90543	90544	Mr Flintwinch	320	‘ None of your nonsense with me , ’
90546	90555	90543	90544	Mr Flintwinch	320	‘ I wo n’t take it from you . ’
90582	90585	90575	90576	her husband	928	‘ Flintwinch , ’
90597	90611	90591	90591	her	313	‘ there is a demon of anger in you . Guard against it . ’
90612	90625	90627	90628	Mr Flintwinch	320	‘ I do n’t care whether there ’s one or a dozen , ’
90644	90672	90673	90673	em	3046	‘ If there was fifty , they should all say , None of your nonsense with me , I wo n’t take it from you -- I’d make ‘

90695	90701	90688	90688	I	0	’ her strong voice asked . ‘
90704	90709	90688	90688	I	0	’ said Mr Flintwinch . ‘
90715	90716	90688	90688	I	0	’ ‘
90724	90725	90723	90723	you--	0	’ ‘
90739	90754	90755	90755	I	0	’ said Jeremiah , sticking to his figurative expression with tenacious and impenetrable obstinacy : ‘
90762	90763	90755	90755	I	0	’ ‘
90769	90774	90767	90767	you	0	’ she began again , ‘
90776	90777	90778	90778	I	0	’ ‘
90784	90788	90789	90789	You	0	’ cried Jeremiah . ‘
90795	90796	90789	90789	You	0	’ ‘
90811	90825	90797	90797	I	0	’ ( Jeremiah chuckled at having forced her to adopt his phrase , ) ‘
90856	90857	90851	90851	You	0	’ ‘
90864	90875	90876	90876	I	0	’ interposed the contradictory Jeremiah , flinging back the concession . ‘
90881	90882	90876	90876	I	0	’ ‘
90897	90910	90894	90894	you	0	’ she replied , after a pause that seemed an angry one . ‘
90934	90935	90918	90923	a rash and headstrong old man	3049	’ ‘
90947	90951	90952	90952	I	0	’ said Jeremiah . ‘
90984	90985	90973	90973	I	0	’ ‘
90997	91006	90989	90989	you	0	’ she said , struggling with her indignation . ‘
91009	91010	90989	90989	you	0	’ ‘
91048	91049	91038	91038	you	0	’ ‘
91055	91064	91065	91065	you	320	’ she cried out in a changed voice : ‘
91073	91104	91065	91065	you	320	’ The old man seemed to think so . There was another pause , and he had altered his position in the room , when he spoke again more mildly : ‘
91353	91354	91355	91355	I	0	’ ‘
91368	91369	91371	91371	you	3065	’ ‘
91384	91388	91371	91371	you	3065	’ growled Jeremiah , ‘
91532	91533	91529	91529	I	0	’ ‘
91554	91555	91559	91559	yourself	3065	’ ‘
91603	91604	91605	91605	Man	950	’ ‘
91617	91645	91607	91607	I	0	’ she cried , with stern emphasis , and appearing from the sound that followed to strike the dead - weight of her arm upon the table . ‘
91650	91655	91607	91607	I	0	’ returned Jeremiah calmly , ‘
91770	91807	91762	91762	I	0	’ Perhaps this had originally been the mainspring of the understanding between them . Descrying thus much of force of character in Mr Flintwinch , perhaps Mrs Clennam had deemed alliance with him worth her while . ‘
91817	91822	91762	91762	I	0	’ said she gloomily . ‘
91831	91837	91824	91824	you	3065	’ returned the persistent Flintwinch , ‘
91849	91928	91840	91840	you	3065	’ Mistress Affery dreamed that the figure of her lord here began walking up and down the room , as if to cool his spleen , and that she ran away ; but that , as he did not issue forth when she had stood listening and trembling in the shadowy hall a little time , she crept up - stairs again , impelled as before by ghosts and curiosity , and once more cowered outside the door . ‘
91937	91954	91935	91935	Flintwinch	320	’ Mrs Clennam was saying , apparently wishing to draw him back into their usual tone . ‘
91975	91994	91962	91963	Little Dorrit	274	’ Mr Flintwinch lighted the candle briskly , and said as he put it down upon the table : ‘
92038	92039	92042	92042	you	3065	’ ‘
92097	92098	92083	92083	I	0	’ ‘
92189	92206	92170	92170	I	0	’ Mr Flintwinch gave this explanation with great calmness , and calmly waited for an answer . ‘
92259	92260	92248	92248	she	274	’ ‘
92266	92276	92248	92248	she	274	’ said Flintwinch , stroking his mouth and chin . ‘
92293	92344	92248	92248	she	274	’ she ejaculated in her sternly wondering way . Mrs Flintwinch dreamed , that , for the space of a minute or two , they remained looking at each other with the candle between them , and that she somehow derived an impression that they looked at each other fixedly . ‘
92354	92387	92248	92248	she	274	’ Affery ’s liege lord then demanded in a much lower voice , and with an amount of expression that seemed quite out of proportion to the simple purpose of his words , ‘
92392	92393	92346	92346	you	3093	’ ‘
92396	92397	92346	92346	you	3093	’ ‘
92409	92423	92404	92404	you	3093	’ said Jeremiah with a pounce as if he had sprung upon her . ‘
92444	92445	92436	92436	I	0	’ ‘
92454	92455	92456	92456	I	0	’ ‘
92460	92477	92456	92456	I	0	’ Mr Flintwinch , having expelled a long significant breath said , with his former emphasis , ‘
92486	92487	92479	92479	I	0	’ ‘
92492	92530	92531	92531	she	274	’ said Mrs Clennam , speaking in one unmodulated hard voice , and separating her words as distinctly as if she were reading them off from separate bits of metal that she took up one by one , ‘
92549	92550	92540	92540	she	274	’ ‘
92567	92594	92595	92595	Flintwinch	320	’ said Jeremiah ; and he said it with a twist , as if his words had come out of him in his own wry shape . ‘
92597	92614	92595	92595	Flintwinch	320	’ said his mistress and partner , flashing into a sudden energy that made Affery start , ‘
92712	92713	92701	92701	you	320	’ ‘
92722	92726	92714	92714	I	0	’ returned Jeremiah . ‘
92793	92794	92785	92785	you	320	’ ‘
92805	92806	92807	92807	I	0	’ ‘
92822	92962	92963	92964	Affery woman	3097	’ Here the sound of the wheeled chair was heard upon the floor , and Affery ’s bell rang with a hasty jerk . More afraid of her husband at the moment than of the mysterious sound in the kitchen , Affery crept away as lightly and as quickly as she could , descended the kitchen stairs almost as rapidly as she had ascended them , resumed her seat before the fire , tucked up her skirt again , and finally threw her apron over her head . Then the bell rang once more , and then once more , and then kept on ringing ; in despite of which importunate summons , Affery still sat behind her apron , recovering her breath . At last Mr Flintwinch came shuffling down the staircase into the hall , muttering and calling ‘
92966	93004	92963	92964	Affery woman	3097	’ all the way . Affery still remaining behind her apron , he came stumbling down the kitchen stairs , candle in hand , sidled up to her , twitched her apron off , and roused her . ‘
93008	93014	93006	93006	Jeremiah	314	’ cried Affery , waking . ‘
93022	93023	93006	93006	Jeremiah	314	’ ‘
93032	93036	93026	93026	you	3097	’ inquired Jeremiah . ‘
93045	93046	93037	93037	You	3097	’ ‘
93050	93055	93048	93048	Jeremiah	314	’ said Mistress Affery , ‘
93063	93099	93056	93056	I	0	’ Reminded of her former achievement in that way , Mr Flintwinch held the candle to her head , as if he had some idea of lighting her up for the illumination of the kitchen . ‘
93111	93133	93134	93134	Jeremiah	314	’ he demanded with a vicious grin , and giving one of the legs of Mistress Affery ’s chair a kick . ‘
93177	93178	93170	93170	I	0	’ ‘
93185	93190	93181	93183	Sleepy - Head	425	’ said Mr Flintwinch , ‘
93197	93198	93193	93193	you	314	’ ‘
93220	93260	93193	93193	you	314	’ Jeremiah held up his light and looked at the blackened ceiling , held down his light and looked at the damp stone floor , turned round with his light and looked about at the spotted and blotched walls . ‘
93269	93284	93193	93193	you	314	’ said Jeremiah . Mistress Affery negatived each with a shake of her head . ‘
93332	93333	93334	93334	Affery	312	’ ‘
93339	93364	93334	93334	Affery	312	’ said Mr Flintwinch grimly , after advancing his nose to that lady ’s lips as a test for the detection of spirituous liquors , ‘
93400	93686	93687	93687	Affery	312	’ This prediction stimulated Mrs Flintwinch to bestir herself , and to hasten up - stairs to Mrs Clennam ’s chamber . But , for all that , she now began to entertain a settled conviction that there was something wrong in the gloomy house . Henceforth , she was never at peace in it after daylight departed ; and never went up or down stairs in the dark without having her apron over her head , lest she should see something . What with these ghostly apprehensions and her singular dreams , Mrs Flintwinch fell that evening into a haunted state of mind , from which it may be long before this present narrative descries any trace of her recovery . In the vagueness and indistinctness of all her new experiences and perceptions , as everything about her was mysterious to herself she began to be mysterious to others : and became as difficult to be made out to anybody ’s satisfaction as she found the house and everything in it difficult to make out to her own . She had not yet finished preparing Mrs Clennam ’s tea , when the soft knock came to the door which always announced Little Dorrit . Mistress Affery looked on at Little Dorrit taking off her homely bonnet in the hall , and at Mr Flintwinch scraping his jaws and contemplating her in silence , as expecting some wonderful consequence to ensue which would frighten her out of her five wits or blow them all three to pieces . After tea there came another knock at the door , announcing Arthur . Mistress Affery went down to let him in , and he said on entering , ‘
93704	93709	93696	93696	I	0	’ Affery immediately replied , ‘
93954	93966	93923	93923	she	312	‘ There , Jeremiah ! Now ! What ’s that noise ? ’
94002	94027	93991	93991	she	312	‘ Affery , old woman , you shall have a dose , old woman , such a dose ! You have been dreaming again ! ’
94721	94730	94732	94732	Clennam	313	‘ How do you do , Mr Doyce ? ’
94737	94756	94732	94732	Clennam	313	‘ I am glad to see you again , and in a healthier place than the Circumlocution Office . ’
94757	94765	94767	94769	that public criminal	3140	‘ Ha ! Mr Meagles ’s friend ! ’
94787	94807	94767	94769	that public criminal	3140	‘ I am glad to see you , sir . Will you excuse me if I forget your name ? ’
94808	94823	94732	94732	Clennam	313	‘ Readily . It ’s not a celebrated name . It ’s not Barnacle . ’
94824	94829	94831	94831	Daniel	374	‘ No , no , ’
94835	94856	94831	94831	Daniel	374	‘ And now I know what it is . It ’s Clennam . How do you do , Mr Clennam ? ’
94857	94863	94865	94865	Arthur	304	‘ I have some hope , ’
94873	94887	94865	94865	Arthur	304	‘ that we may be going to the same place , Mr Doyce . ’
94888	94892	94894	94894	Daniel	374	‘ Meaning Twickenham ? ’
94896	94904	94894	94894	Daniel	374	‘ I am glad to hear it . ’
95102	95109	95111	95114	the lock - maker	3152	‘ struck out a few little things ’
95173	95178	95166	95166	His	374	‘ worked in the shop ’
95400	95408	95410	95410	Clennam	304	‘ It is much to be regretted , ’
95412	95425	95410	95410	Clennam	304	‘ that you ever turned your thoughts that way , Mr Doyce . ’
95426	95467	95479	95479	Clennam	304	‘ True , sir , true to a certain extent . But what is a man to do ? if he has the misfortune to strike out something serviceable to the nation , he must follow where it leads him . ’
95468	95477	95479	95479	Clennam	304	‘ Had n’t he better let it go ? ’
95481	95488	95490	95490	Doyce	426	‘ He ca n’t do it , ’
95500	95551	95493	95493	his	426	‘ It ’s not put into his head to be buried . It ’s put into his head to be made useful . You hold your life on the condition that to the last you shall struggle hard for it . Every man holds a discovery on the same terms . ’
95552	95558	95560	95560	Arthur	304	‘ That is to say , ’
95571	95580	95560	95560	Arthur	304	‘ you are not finally discouraged even now ? ’
95581	95593	95595	95596	the other	9761	‘ I have no right to be , if I am , ’
95598	95609	95595	95596	the other	9761	‘ The thing is as true as it ever was . ’
95661	95664	95665	95665	he	426	‘ No , ’
95668	95735	95736	95736	he	426	‘ not at present . I had when I first entered on it , and a good man he was . But he has been dead some years ; and as I could not easily take to the notion of another when I lost him , I bought his share for myself and have gone on by myself ever since . And here ’s another thing , ’
95772	95785	95736	95736	he	426	‘ no inventor can be a man of business , you know . ’
95786	95789	95791	95791	Clennam	304	‘ No ? ’
95793	95803	95804	95804	he	426	‘ Why , so the men of business say , ’
95814	95858	95860	95860	Doyce	426	‘ I do n’t know why we unfortunate creatures should be supposed to want common sense , but it is generally taken for granted that we do . Even the best friend I have in the world , our excellent friend over yonder , ’
95866	95892	95860	95860	Doyce	426	‘ extends a sort of protection to me , do n’t you know , as a man not quite able to take care of himself ? ’
95915	95938	95940	95941	Daniel Doyce	374	‘ So I find that I must have a partner who is a man of business and not guilty of any inventions , ’
95955	96014	95940	95941	Daniel Doyce	374	‘ if it ’s only in deference to the current opinion , and to uphold the credit of the Works . I do n’t think he ’ll find that I have been very remiss or confused in my way of conducting them ; but that ’s for him to say -- whoever he is -- not for me . ’
96015	96025	95860	95860	Doyce	426	‘ You have not chosen him yet , then ? ’
96026	96131	96133	96133	Doyce	374	‘ No , sir , no . I have only just come to a decision to take one . The fact is , there ’s more to do than there used to be , and the Works are enough for me as I grow older . What with the books and correspondence , and foreign journeys for which a Principal is necessary , I ca n’t do all . I am going to talk over the best way of negotiating the matter , if I find a spare half - hour between this and Monday morning , with my -- my Nurse and protector , ’
96140	96158	96133	96133	Doyce	374	‘ He is a sagacious man in business , and has had a good apprenticeship to it . ’
96662	96670	96672	96673	Mr Meagles	288	‘ Here we are , you see , ’
96675	96717	96672	96673	Mr Meagles	288	‘ boxed up , Mr Clennam , within our own home - limits , as if we were never going to expand -- that is , travel -- again . Not like Marseilles , eh ? No allonging and marshonging here ! ’
96718	96727	96729	96729	Clennam	304	‘ A different kind of beauty , indeed ! ’
96735	96742	96744	96745	Mr Meagles	288	‘ But , Lord bless me ! ’
96754	96787	96748	96748	his	288	‘ it was an uncommonly pleasant thing being in quarantine , was n’t it ? Do you know , I have often wished myself back again ? We were a capital party . ’
96821	96829	96831	96832	Mr Meagles	288	‘ If it was summer - time , ’
96834	96928	96831	96832	Mr Meagles	288	‘ which I wish it was on your account , and in order that you might see the place at its best , you would hardly be able to hear yourself speak for birds . Being practical people , we never allow anybody to scare the birds ; and the birds , being practical people too , come about us in myriads . We are delighted to see you , Clennam ( if you ’ll allow me , I shall drop the Mister ) ; I heartily assure you , we are delighted . ’
96929	96939	96941	96941	Clennam	304	‘ I have not had so pleasant a greeting , ’
96961	96979	96947	96948	Little Dorrit	274	‘ except once -- since we last walked to and fro , looking down at the Mediterranean . ’
96980	96983	96985	96986	Mr Meagles	288	‘ Ah ! ’
96988	97039	96985	96986	Mr Meagles	288	‘ Something like a look out , _ that _ was , was n’t it ? I do n’t want a military government , but I should n’t mind a little allonging and marshonging -- just a dash of it -- in this neighbourhood sometimes . It ’s Devilish still . ’
97447	97451	97453	97460	a specially oily old gentleman in a blanket	3211	‘ Sage , Reading ’
97627	97635	97637	97638	Mr Meagles	288	‘ Here they are , you see , ’
97640	97739	97637	97638	Mr Meagles	288	‘ I stood behind these two articles five - and - thirty years running , when I no more thought of gadding about than I now think of -- staying at home . When I left the Bank for good , I asked for them , and brought them away with me . I mention it at once , or you might suppose that I sit in my counting - house ( as Pet says I do ) , like the king in the poem of the four - and - twenty blackbirds , counting out my money . ’
97763	97768	97770	97771	Mr Meagles	288	‘ Yes , Clennam , ’
97778	97804	97770	97771	Mr Meagles	288	‘ There they both are . It was taken some seventeen years ago . As I often say to Mother , they were babies then . ’
97805	97809	97811	97811	Arthur	304	‘ Their names ? ’
97813	97840	97811	97811	Arthur	304	‘ Ah , to be sure ! You have never heard any name but Pet . Pet ’s name is Minnie ; her sister ’s Lillie . ’
97841	97859	97862	97862	herself	291	‘ Should you have known , Mr Clennam , that one of them was meant for me ? ’
97870	97893	97895	97895	Clennam	304	‘ I might have thought that both of them were meant for you , both are still so like you . Indeed , ’
97908	97921	97895	97895	Clennam	304	‘ I can not even now say which is not your portrait . ’
97922	97929	97931	97932	Mr Meagles	288	‘ D’ye hear that , Mother ? ’
97943	97964	97931	97932	Mr Meagles	288	‘ It ’s always the same , Clennam ; nobody can decide . The child to your left is Pet . ’
98028	98032	98034	98035	Mr Meagles	288	‘ But come ! ’
98037	98083	98034	98035	Mr Meagles	288	‘ You have had a long walk , and will be glad to get your boots off . As to Daniel here , I suppose he ’d never think of taking _ his _ boots off , unless we showed him a boot - jack . ’
98084	98088	98090	98090	Daniel	374	‘ Why not ? ’
98099	98111	98113	98114	Mr Meagles	288	‘ Oh ! You have so many things to think about , ’
98136	98159	98113	98114	Mr Meagles	288	‘ Figures , and wheels , and cogs , and levers , and screws , and cylinders , and a thousand things . ’
98160	98165	98167	98167	Daniel	374	‘ In my calling , ’
98171	98193	98167	98167	Daniel	374	‘ the greater usually includes the less . But never mind , never mind ! Whatever pleases you , pleases me . ’
98805	98810	98812	98813	Mr Meagles	288	‘ And Miss Wade , ’
98826	98833	98812	98813	Mr Meagles	288	‘ Has anybody seen Miss Wade ? ’
98834	98838	98840	98840	Tattycoram	293	‘ I have , ’
98879	98882	98883	98885	her young mistress	3237	‘ Tatty ! ’
98888	98894	98883	98885	her young mistress	3237	‘ You seen Miss Wade?--where ? ’
98895	98900	98902	98902	Tattycoram	293	‘ Here , miss , ’
98904	98907	98902	98902	Tattycoram	293	‘ How ? ’
98922	98927	98929	98929	her	293	‘ With my eyes ! ’
98936	98944	98929	98929	her	293	‘ I met her near the church . ’
98945	98954	98956	98957	Mr Meagles	288	‘ What was she doing there I wonder ! ’
98959	98969	98956	98957	Mr Meagles	288	‘ Not going to it , I should think . ’
98970	98978	98980	98980	Tattycoram	293	‘ She had written to me first , ’
98982	98987	98980	98980	Tattycoram	293	‘ Oh , Tatty ! ’
98992	99009	99010	99010	She	9962	‘ take your hands away . I feel as if some one else was touching me ! ’
99058	99067	99068	99068	she	9962	‘ Did you wish to know , sir , ’
99076	99085	99068	99068	she	9962	‘ what Miss Wade wrote to me about ? ’
99086	99091	99093	99094	Mr Meagles	288	‘ Well , Tattycoram , ’
99096	99124	99068	99068	she	9962	‘ since you ask the question , and we are all friends here , perhaps you may as well mention it , if you are so inclined . ’
99125	99138	99140	99140	Tattycoram	293	‘ She knew , when we were travelling , where you lived , ’
99142	99153	99140	99140	Tattycoram	293	‘ and she had seen me not quite -- not quite-- ’
99154	99164	99166	99167	Mr Meagles	288	‘ Not quite in a good temper , Tattycoram ? ’
99181	99196	99170	99170	his	288	‘ Take a little time -- count five - and - twenty , Tattycoram . ’
99211	99227	99228	99228	she	293	‘ So she wrote to me to say that if I ever felt myself hurt , ’
99236	99242	99243	99243	she	293	‘ or found myself worried , ’
99250	99286	99243	99243	she	293	‘ I might go to her , and be considerately treated . I was to think of it , and could speak to her by the church . So I went there to thank her . ’

99310	99344	99297	99297	her	293	‘ Miss Wade almost frightened me when we parted , and I scarcely like to think of her just now as having been so near me without my knowing it . Tatty dear ! ’
99353	99356	99358	99359	Mr Meagles	288	‘ Hey ? ’
99361	99372	99358	99359	Mr Meagles	288	‘ Count another five - and - twenty , Tattycoram . ’
99411	99415	99417	99418	Mr Meagles	288	‘ Now there , ’
99442	99562	99422	99422	he	288	‘ There ’s a girl who might be lost and ruined , if she was n’t among practical people . Mother and I know , solely from being practical , that there are times when that girl ’s whole nature seems to roughen itself against seeing us so bound up in Pet . No father and mother were bound up in her , poor soul . I do n’t like to think of the way in which that unfortunate child , with all that passion and protest in her , feels when she hears the Fifth Commandment on a Sunday . I am always inclined to call out , Church , Count five - and - twenty , Tattycoram . ’
99603	99611	99613	99614	Mr Meagles	288	‘ And why not , you see ? ’
99619	99643	99613	99614	Mr Meagles	288	‘ As I always say to Mother , why not have something pretty to look at , if you have anything at all ? ’
99991	100004	100006	100014	the astonished Mr Meagles , who was his partner	3270	‘ Why , what are you thinking of , my good sir ? ’
100016	100024	100026	100026	Clennam	304	‘ I beg your pardon . Nothing , ’
100028	100042	100044	100045	Mr Meagles	288	‘ Think of something , next time ; that ’s a dear fellow , ’
100058	100066	100068	100069	her father	766	‘ Why of Miss Wade , Pet ? ’
100071	100076	100078	100079	Arthur Clennam	304	‘ Why , indeed ! ’
100144	100148	100149	100149	he	304	‘ Mr Meagles , ’
100158	100172	100149	100149	he	304	‘ do you remember when you advised me to go straight to London ? ’
100173	100177	100123	100124	The host	3016	‘ Perfectly well . ’
100178	100195	100149	100149	he	304	‘ And when you gave me some other good advice which I needed at that time ? ’
100196	100206	100208	100209	Mr Meagles	288	‘ I wo n’t say what it was worth , ’
100211	100225	100149	100149	he	304	‘ but of course I remember our being very pleasant and confidential together . ’
100226	100264	100149	100149	he	304	‘ I have acted on your advice ; and having disembarrassed myself of an occupation that was painful to me for many reasons , wish to devote myself and what means I have , to another pursuit . ’
100265	100276	100278	100279	Mr Meagles	288	‘ Right ! You ca n’t do it too soon , ’
100281	100336	100278	100279	Mr Meagles	288	‘ Now , as I came down to - day , I found that your friend , Mr Doyce , is looking for a partner in his business -- not a partner in his mechanical knowledge , but in the ways and means of turning the business arising from it to the best account . ’
100337	100341	100343	100344	Mr Meagles	288	‘ Just so , ’
100370	100446	100278	100279	Mr Meagles	288	‘ Mr Doyce mentioned incidentally , in the course of our conversation , that he was going to take your valuable advice on the subject of finding such a partner . If you should think our views and opportunities at all likely to coincide , perhaps you will let him know my available position . I speak , of course , in ignorance of the details , and they may be unsuitable on both sides . ’
100447	100454	100456	100457	Mr Meagles	288	‘ No doubt , no doubt , ’
100469	100480	100278	100279	Mr Meagles	288	‘ But they will be a question of figures and accounts-- ’
100481	100488	100490	100491	Mr Meagles	288	‘ Just so , just so , ’
100503	100550	100278	100279	Mr Meagles	288	‘ --And I shall be glad to enter into the subject , provided Mr Doyce responds , and you think well of it . If you will at present , therefore , allow me to place it in your hands , you will much oblige me . ’
100551	100561	100563	100564	Mr Meagles	288	‘ Clennam , I accept the trust with readiness , ’
100566	100619	100563	100564	Mr Meagles	288	‘ And without anticipating any of the points which you , as a man of business , have of course reserved , I am free to say to you that I think something may come of this . Of one thing you may be perfectly certain . Daniel is an honest man . ’
100620	100640	100278	100279	Mr Meagles	288	‘ I am so sure of it that I have promptly made up my mind to speak to you . ’
100641	100668	100670	100671	Mr Meagles	288	‘ You must guide him , you know ; you must steer him ; you must direct him ; he is one of a crotchety sort , ’
100688	100703	100679	100679	he	288	‘ but he is as honest as the sun , and so good night ! ’
100834	100840	100815	100815	he	304	‘ Suppose that a man , ’
100846	101023	100842	100842	his	304	‘ who had been of age some twenty years or so ; who was a diffident man , from the circumstances of his youth ; who was rather a grave man , from the tenor of his life ; who knew himself to be deficient in many little engaging qualities which he admired in others , from having been long in a distant region , with nothing softening near him ; who had no kind sisters to present to her ; who had no congenial home to make her known in ; who was a stranger in the land ; who had not a fortune to compensate , in any measure , for these defects ; who had nothing in his favour but his honest love and his general wish to do right -- suppose such a man were to come to this house , and were to yield to the captivation of this charming girl , and were to persuade himself that he could hope to win her ; what a weakness it would be ! ’
101473	101478	101479	101479	he	3303	‘ Not this morning , ’
101485	101492	101479	101479	he	3303	‘ You wo n’t do for ladies ’
101501	101615	101479	101479	he	3303	’ Clennam followed the man and the dog into the boat , and took his seat . The dog did as he was ordered . The man remained standing , with his hands in his pockets , and towered between Clennam and the prospect . Man and dog both jumped lightly out as soon as they touched the other side , and went away . Clennam was glad to be rid of them . The church clock struck the breakfast hour as he walked up the little lane by which the garden - gate was approached . The moment he pulled the bell a deep loud barking assailed him from within the wall . ‘
101623	101650	101616	101616	I	0	’ thought Clennam . The gate was opened by one of the rosy maids , and on the lawn were the Newfoundland dog and the man . ‘
101660	101685	101651	101652	Miss Minnie	436	’ said the blushing portress , as they all came together in the garden . Then she said to the master of the dog , ‘
101691	101696	101686	101687	Mr Clennam	304	’ and tripped away . ‘
101711	101723	101700	101701	Mr Clennam	304	’ said the man . Upon which the dog became mute . ‘
101745	101789	101730	101731	Henry Gowan	272	’ The manner was easy , and the voice agreeable ; but still Clennam thought , that if he had not made that decided resolution to avoid falling in love with Pet , he would have taken a dislike to this Henry Gowan . ‘
101799	101811	101796	101796	I	0	’ said this Gowan , when Arthur had extolled the place . ‘
101824	101825	101815	101815	I	0	’ ‘
101863	101890	101853	101853	I	0	’ But for that resolution so often recalled , Clennam might have wished him in the crater of Mount Etna , in return for this civility . ‘
101914	102287	102290	102290	Gowan	272	’ It was ( at least it might have been , always excepting for that wise resolution ) like his dexterous impudence to call it a Paradise . He only called it a Paradise because he first saw her coming , and so made her out within her hearing to be an angel , Confusion to him ! And ah ! how beaming she looked , and how glad ! How she caressed the dog , and how the dog knew her ! How expressive that heightened colour in her face , that fluttered manner , her downcast eyes , her irresolute happiness ! When had Clennam seen her look like this ? Not that there was any reason why he might , could , would , or should have ever seen her look like this , or that he had ever hoped for himself to see her look like this ; but still -- when had he ever known her do it ! He stood at a little distance from them . This Gowan when he had talked about a Paradise , had gone up to her and taken her hand . The dog had put his great paws on her arm and laid his head against her dear bosom . She had laughed and welcomed them , and made far too much of the dog , far , far , too much -- that is to say , supposing there had been any third person looking on who loved her . She disengaged herself now , and came to Clennam , and put her hand in his and wished him good morning , and gracefully made as if she would take his arm and be escorted into the house . To this Gowan had no objection . No , he knew he was too safe . There was a passing cloud on Mr Meagles ’s good - humoured face when they all three ( four , counting the dog , and he was the most objectionable but one of the party ) came in to breakfast . Neither it , nor the touch of uneasiness on Mrs Meagles as she directed her eyes towards it , was unobserved by Clennam . ‘
102292	102302	102290	102290	Gowan	272	’ said Mr Meagles , even suppressing a sigh ; ‘
102312	102313	102318	102318	sir	933	’ ‘
102357	102378	102349	102349	I	0	’ Then he told how he had met Mr Clennam at the ferry , and they had come over together . ‘
102386	102397	102379	102380	Mrs Gowan	576	’ said Mrs Meagles . ( Clennam became attentive . ) ‘
102407	102414	102415	102415	I	0	’ ( Clennam became inattentive . ) ‘
102458	102467	102468	102470	The young fellow	3317	’ he explained , turning to the latter . ‘
102497	102498	102487	102487	you	933	’ ‘
102507	102515	102516	102516	He	3317	’ asked Mr Meagles with peculiar complacency . ‘
102562	102563	102554	102554	He	3317	’ ‘
102568	102572	102554	102554	He	3317	’ said Meagles . ‘
102742	102743	102739	102740	Lord Decimus	403	’ ‘
102757	102758	102759	102759	Nephew	3343	’ ‘
102767	102794	102759	102759	Nephew	3343	’ Mr Meagles luxuriously repeated with his eyes shut , that he might have nothing to distract him from the full flavour of the genealogical tree . ‘
102808	102809	102805	102805	he	3327	’ ‘
102819	102820	102815	102817	his great uncle	3344	’ ‘
102826	102839	102842	102843	the mother	1250	’ said Mr Meagles , opening his eyes with a fresh discovery . ‘
102854	102855	102858	102858	she	445	’ ‘
102861	102862	102858	102858	she	445	’ ‘
102869	102877	102858	102858	she	445	’ said Mr Meagles with much interest . ‘
102919	103019	103020	103020	I	0	’ In the beginning of this dialogue , Clennam had expected some great harmless outburst from Mr Meagles , like that which had made him burst out of the Circumlocution Office , holding Doyce by the collar . But his good friend had a weakness which none of us need go into the next street to find , and which no amount of Circumlocution experience could long subdue in him . Clennam looked at Doyce ; but Doyce knew all about it beforehand , and looked at his plate , and made no sign , and said no word . ‘
103027	103036	103020	103020	I	0	’ said Gowan , to conclude the subject . ‘
103057	103142	103143	103143	I	0	’ It appeared , before the breakfast was over , that everybody whom this Gowan knew was either more or less of an ass , or more or less of a knave ; but was , notwithstanding , the most lovable , the most engaging , the simplest , truest , kindest , dearest , best fellow that ever lived . The process by which this unvarying result was attained , whatever the premises , might have been stated by Mr Henry Gowan thus : ‘
103236	103666	103667	103667	You	3357	’ The effect of this cheering discovery happened to be , that while he seemed to be scrupulously finding good in most men , he did in reality lower it where it was , and set it up where it was not ; but that was its only disagreeable or dangerous feature . It scarcely seemed , however , to afford Mr Meagles as much satisfaction as the Barnacle genealogy had done . The cloud that Clennam had never seen upon his face before that morning , frequently overcast it again ; and there was the same shadow of uneasy observation of him on the comely face of his wife . More than once or twice when Pet caressed the dog , it appeared to Clennam that her father was unhappy in seeing her do it ; and , in one particular instance when Gowan stood on the other side of the dog , and bent his head at the same time , Arthur fancied that he saw tears rise to Mr Meagles ’s eyes as he hurried out of the room . It was either the fact too , or he fancied further , that Pet herself was not insensible to these little incidents ; that she tried , with a more delicate affection than usual , to express to her good father how much she loved him ; that it was on this account that she fell behind the rest , both as they went to church and as they returned from it , and took his arm . He could not have sworn but that as he walked alone in the garden afterwards , he had an instantaneous glimpse of her in her father ’s room , clinging to both her parents with the greatest tenderness , and weeping on her father ’s shoulder . The latter part of the day turning out wet , they were fain to keep the house , look over Mr Meagles ’s collection , and beguile the time with conversation . This Gowan had plenty to say for himself , and said it in an off - hand and amusing manner . He appeared to be an artist by profession , and to have been at Rome some time ; yet he had a slight , careless , amateur way with him -- a perceptible limp , both in his devotion to art and his attainments -- which Clennam could scarcely understand . He applied to Daniel Doyce for help , as they stood together , looking out of window . ‘
103672	103680	103667	103667	You	3357	’ he said in a low voice . ‘
103697	103698	103699	103700	An artist	2843	’ ‘
103709	103710	103706	103706	he	272	’ ‘
103717	103727	103706	103706	he	272	’ said Daniel Doyce , in a surly tone . ‘
103734	103742	103745	103745	he	272	’ asked Clennam , with a smile . ‘
103759	103763	103745	103745	he	272	’ said Doyce , ‘
103777	104068	104114	104114	his	403	’ Pursuing his inquiries , Clennam found that the Gowan family were a very distant ramification of the Barnacles ; and that the paternal Gowan , originally attached to a legation abroad , had been pensioned off as a Commissioner of nothing particular somewhere or other , and had died at his post with his drawn salary in his hand , nobly defending it to the last extremity . In consideration of this eminent public service , the Barnacle then in power had recommended the Crown to bestow a pension of two or three hundred a - year on his widow ; to which the next Barnacle in power had added certain shady and sedate apartments in the Palaces at Hampton Court , where the old lady still lived , deploring the degeneracy of the times in company with several other old ladies of both sexes . Her son , Mr Henry Gowan , inheriting from his father , the Commissioner , that very questionable help in life , a very small independence , had been difficult to settle ; the rather , as public appointments chanced to be scarce , and his genius , during his earlier manhood , was of that exclusively agricultural character which applies itself to the cultivation of wild oats . At last he had declared that he would become a Painter ; partly because he had always had an idle knack that way , and partly to grieve the souls of the Barnacles - in - chief who had not provided for him . So it had come to pass successively , first , that several distinguished ladies had been frightfully shocked ; then , that portfolios of his performances had been handed about o ’

104421	104442	104389	104389	he	363	‘ I want to speak to you , Gowan . I say . Look here . Who is that fellow ? ’
104443	104455	104389	104389	he	363	‘ A friend of our host ’s . None of mine . ’
104456	104467	104469	104470	Young Barnacle	363	‘ He ’s a most ferocious Radical , you know , ’
104472	104481	104469	104470	Young Barnacle	363	‘ Is he ? How do you know ? ’
104482	104545	104389	104389	he	363	‘ Ecod , sir , he was Pitching into our people the other day in the most tremendous manner . Went up to our place and Pitched into my father to that extent that it was necessary to order him out . Came back to our Department , and Pitched into me . Look here . You never saw such a fellow . ’
104546	104552	104469	104470	Young Barnacle	363	‘ What did he want ? ’
104553	104558	104560	104561	Young Barnacle	363	‘ Ecod , sir , ’
104563	104589	104560	104561	Young Barnacle	363	‘ he said he wanted to know , you know ! Pervaded our Department -- without an appointment -- and said he wanted to know ! ’

Since their recent return , our friend has yielded to a weekly visit , but that is the utmost . Minnie would not deceive her father and mother . You have travelled with them , and I believe you know what a bond there is among them , extending even beyond this present life . All that there is between Miss Minnie and Mr Gowan , I have no doubt we see . ’

Miss Amy , I know very well that your high - souled brother , and likewise your spirited sister , spurn me from a height . What I have to do is to respect them , to wish to be admitted to their friendship , to look up at the eminence on which they are placed from my lowlier station -- for , whether viewed as tobacco or viewed as the lock , I well know it is lowly -- and ever wish them well and happy . ’

When you think of me at all , John , let it only be as the child you have seen grow up in the prison with one set of duties always occupying her ; as a weak , retired , contented , unprotected girl . I particularly want you to remember , that when I come outside the gate , I am unprotected and solitary . ’

His name was Captain Martin ; and he consulted me on the question whether it was necessary that his daughter -- sister -- should hazard offending the turnkey brother by being too -- ha!--too plain with the other brother . Captain Martin was a gentleman and a man of honour , and I put it to him first to give me his -- his own opinion . Captain Martin ( highly respected in the army ) then unhesitatingly said that it appeared to him that his -- hem!--sister was not called upon to understand the young man too distinctly , and that she might lead him on -- I am doubtful whether “ lead him on ” was Captain Martin ’s exact expression : indeed I think he said tolerate him -- on her father’s -- I should say , brother’s -- account . I hardly know how I have strayed into this story . I suppose it has been through being unable to account for Chivery ; but as to the connection between the two , I do n’t see-- ’

Go out and ask what funeral here ( it must be here , I know it can be nowhere else ) will make more talk , and perhaps more grief , than any that has ever gone out at the gate . They ’ll say your father ’s . Well then . Amy ! Amy ! Is your father so universally despised ? Is there nothing to redeem him ? Will you have nothing to remember him by but his ruin and decay ? Will you be able to have no affection for him when he is gone , poor castaway , gone ? ’

120301	120370	120287	120287	Fanny	342	‘ has been asking me to tell her , as between sisters , how I came to have the honour of knowing you . And as I had engaged to call upon you once more , I thought I might take the liberty of bringing her with me , when perhaps you would tell her . I wish her to know , and perhaps you will tell her ? ’

120408	120411	120413	120414	Mrs Merdle	464	‘ Society , ’
120424	120474	120413	120414	Mrs Merdle	464	‘ is so difficult to explain to young persons ( indeed is so difficult to explain to most persons ) , that I am glad to hear that . I wish Society was not so arbitrary , I wish it was not so exacting -- Bird , be quiet ! ’
120499	120502	120504	120505	Mrs Merdle	464	‘ But , ’
120507	120606	120504	120505	Mrs Merdle	464	‘ we must take it as we find it . We know it is hollow and conventional and worldly and very shocking , but unless we are Savages in the Tropical seas ( I should have been charmed to be one myself -- most delightful life and perfect climate , I am told ) , we must consult it . It is the common lot . Mr Merdle is a most extensive merchant , his transactions are on the vastest scale , his wealth and influence are very great , but even he -- Bird , be quiet ! ’
120633	120646	120647	120647	she	464	‘ Since your sister begs that I would terminate our personal acquaintance , ’
120655	120702	120647	120647	she	464	‘ by relating the circumstances that are much to her credit , I can not object to comply with her request , I am sure . I have a son ( I was first married extremely young ) of two or three - and - twenty . ’
120718	120780	120709	120709	her	342	‘ A son of two or three - and - twenty . He is a little gay , a thing Society is accustomed to in young men , and he is very impressible . Perhaps he inherits that misfortune . I am very impressible myself , by nature . The weakest of creatures -- my feelings are touched in a moment . ’
120837	120906	120821	120821	she	1027	‘ So he is very impressible . Not a misfortune in our natural state I dare say , but we are not in a natural state . Much to be lamented , no doubt , particularly by myself , who am a child of nature if I could but show it ; but so it is . Society suppresses us and dominates us -- Bird , be quiet ! ’
120938	120962	120964	120965	Mrs Merdle	464	‘ It is quite unnecessary to say to a person of your good sense , wide range of experience , and cultivated feeling , ’

122075	122080	122032	122033	your sister	10351	’ said Mrs Merdle , ‘
122110	122127	122128	122129	Miss Dorrit	349	’ added Mrs Merdle , quitting her nest , and putting something in Fanny ’s hand , ‘
122145	122225	122128	122129	Miss Dorrit	349	’ The sisters rose at the same time , and they all stood near the cage of the parrot , as he tore at a claw - full of biscuit and spat it out , seemed to mock them with a pompous dance of his body without moving his feet , and suddenly turned himself upside down and trailed himself all over the outside of his golden cage , with the aid of his cruel beak and black tongue . ‘
122235	122240	122228	122229	Miss Dorrit	349	’ said Mrs Merdle . ‘

122504	122520	122500	122502	You little Fool	3895	’ returned her sister , shaking her with the sharp pull she gave her arm . ‘
122566	122572	122573	122573	you	342	’ with the scornfullest emphasis , ‘

122727	122839	122841	122841	you	3903	’ They spoke no more all the way back to the lodging where Fanny and her uncle lived . When they arrived there , they found the old man practising his clarionet in the dolefullest manner in a corner of the room . Fanny had a composite meal to make , of chops , and porter , and tea ; and indignantly pretended to prepare it for herself , though her sister did all that in quiet reality . When at last Fanny sat down to eat and drink , she threw the table implements about and was angry with her bread , much as her father had been last night . ‘
122845	122854	122841	122841	you	3903	’ she said , bursting into vehement tears , ‘

122995	123041	122985	122985	You	349	’ All this time the uncle was dolefully blowing his clarionet in the corner , sometimes taking it an inch or so from his mouth for a moment while he stopped to gaze at them , with a vague impression that somebody had said something . ‘
123110	123255	123256	123256	I	0	’ Poor Little Dorrit felt the injustice of this taunt rather sharply . The remembrance of last night added a barbed point to it . She said nothing in reply , but turned her chair from the table towards the fire . Uncle , after making one more pause , blew a dismal wail and went on again . Fanny was passionate with the tea - cups and the bread as long as her passion lasted , and then protested that she was the wretchedest girl in the world , and she wished she was dead . After that , her crying became remorseful , and she got up and put her arms round her sister . Little Dorrit tried to stop her from saying anything , but she answered that she would , she must ! Thereupon she said again , and again , ‘
123263	123265	123256	123256	I	0	’ and ‘
123271	123283	123269	123269	Amy	349	’ almost as passionately as she had said what she regretted . ‘

123447	123452	123445	123445	Amy	349	’ Little Dorrit again nodded ‘

Little Dorrit parted from them at the door , and hastened back to the Marshalsea . It fell dark there sooner than elsewhere , and going into it that evening was like going into a deep trench . The shadow of the wall was on every object . Not least upon the figure in the old grey gown and the black velvet cap , as it turned towards her when she opened the door of the dim room . ‘
123683	123696	123534	123544	a tranquil , domestic , home - loving , good girl	3918	’ thought Little Dorrit , with the door yet in her hand . ‘
123704	124103	123534	123544	a tranquil , domestic , home - loving , good girl	3918	’ CHAPTER 21 . Mr Merdle ’s Complaint Upon that establishment of state , the Merdle establishment in Harley Street , Cavendish Square , there was the shadow of no more common wall than the fronts of other establishments of state on the opposite side of the street . Like unexceptionable Society , the opposing rows of houses in Harley Street were very grim with one another . Indeed , the mansions and their inhabitants were so much alike in that respect , that the people were often to be found drawn up on opposite sides of dinner - tables , in the shade of their own loftiness , staring at the other side of the way with the dullness of the houses . Everybody knows how like the street the two dinner - rows of people who take their stand by the street will be . The expressionless uniform twenty houses , all to be knocked at and rung at in the same form , all approachable by the same dull steps , all fended off by the same pattern of railing , all with the same impracticable fire - escapes , the same inconvenient fixtures in their heads , and everything without exception to be taken at a high valuation -- who has not dined with these ? The house so drearily out of repair , the occasional bow - window , the stuccoed house , the newly - fronted house , the corner house with nothing but angular rooms , the house with the blinds always down , the house with the hatchment always up , the house where the collector has called for one quarter of an Idea , and found nobody at home -- who has not dined with these ? The house that nobody will take , and is to be had a bargain -- who does not know her ? The showy house that was taken for life by the disappointed gentleman , and which does not suit him at all -- who is unacquainted with that haunted habitation ? Harley Street , Cavendish Square , was more than aware of Mr and Mrs Merdle . Intruders there were in Harley Street , of whom it was not aware ; but Mr and Mrs Merdle it delighted to honour . Society was aware of Mr and Mrs Merdle . Society had said ‘
124114	124192	123534	123544	a tranquil , domestic , home - loving , good girl	3918	’ Mr Merdle was immensely rich ; a man of prodigious enterprise ; a Midas without the ears , who turned all he touched to gold . He was in everything good , from banking to building . He was in Parliament , of course . He was in the City , necessarily . He was Chairman of this , Trustee of that , President of the other . The weightiest of men had said to projectors , ‘
124206	124219	124204	124204	Merdle	273	’ And , the reply being in the negative , had said , ‘
124228	124897	124221	124221	I	0	’ This great and fortunate man had provided that extensive bosom which required so much room to be unfeeling enough in , with a nest of crimson and gold some fifteen years before . It was not a bosom to repose upon , but it was a capital bosom to hang jewels upon . Mr Merdle wanted something to hang jewels upon , and he bought it for the purpose . Storr and Mortimer might have married on the same speculation . Like all his other speculations , it was sound and successful . The jewels showed to the richest advantage . The bosom moving in Society with the jewels displayed upon it , attracted general admiration . Society approving , Mr Merdle was satisfied . He was the most disinterested of men,--did everything for Society , and got as little for himself out of all his gain and care , as a man might . That is to say , it may be supposed that he got all he wanted , otherwise with unlimited wealth he would have got it . But his desire was to the utmost to satisfy Society ( whatever that was ) , and take up all its drafts upon him for tribute . He did not shine in company ; he had not very much to say for himself ; he was a reserved man , with a broad , overhanging , watchful head , that particular kind of dull red colour in his cheeks which is rather stale than fresh , and a somewhat uneasy expression about his coat - cuffs , as if they were in his confidence , and had reasons for being anxious to hide his hands . In the little he said , he was a pleasant man enough ; plain , emphatic about public and private confidence , and tenacious of the utmost deference being shown by every one , in all things , to Society . In this same Society ( if that were it which came to his dinners , and to Mrs Merdle ’s receptions and concerts ) , he hardly seemed to enjoy himself much , and was mostly to be found against walls and behind doors . Also when he went out to it , instead of its coming home to him , he seemed a little fatigued , and upon the whole rather more disposed for bed ; but he was always cultivating it nevertheless , and always moving in it -- and always laying out money on it with the greatest liberality . Mrs Merdle ’s first husband had been a colonel , under whose auspices the bosom had entered into competition with the snows of North America , and had come off at little disadvantage in point of whiteness , and at none in point of coldness . The colonel ’s son was Mrs Merdle ’s only child . He was of a chuckle - headed , high - shouldered make , with a general appearance of being , not so much a young man as a swelled boy . He had given so few signs of reason , that a by - word went among his companions that his brain had been frozen up in a mighty frost which prevailed at St John ’s , New Brunswick , at the period of his birth there , and had never thawed from that hour . Another by - word represented him as having in his infancy , through the negligence of a nurse , fallen out of a high window on his head , which had been heard by responsible witnesses to crack . It is probable that both these representations were of ex post facto origin ; the young gentleman ( whose expressive name was Sparkler ) being monomaniacal in offering marriage to all manner of undesirable young ladies , and in remarking of every successive young lady to whom he tendered a matrimonial proposal that she was ‘
124914	125132	125133	125133	I	0	’ A son - in - law with these limited talents , might have been a clog upon another man ; but Mr Merdle did not want a son - in - law for himself ; he wanted a son - in - law for Society . Mr Sparkler having been in the Guards , and being in the habit of frequenting all the races , and all the lounges , and all the parties , and being well known , Society was satisfied with its son - in - law . This happy result Mr Merdle would have considered well attained , though Mr Sparkler had been a more expensive article . And he did not get Mr Sparkler by any means cheap for Society , even as it was . There was a dinner giving in the Harley Street establishment , while Little Dorrit was stitching at her father ’s new shirts by his side that night ; and there were magnates from the Court and magnates from the City , magnates from the Commons and magnates from the Lords , magnates from the bench and magnates from the bar , Bishop magnates , Treasury magnates , Horse Guard magnates , Admiralty magnates,--all the magnates that keep us going , and sometimes trip us up . ‘
125137	125145	125133	125133	I	0	’ said Bishop magnate to Horse Guards , ‘
125162	125948	125155	125155	They	3923	’ Horse Guards had heard two . Treasury had heard three . Bar , handling his persuasive double eye - glass , was by no means clear but that it might be four . It was one of those happy strokes of calculation and combination , the result of which it was difficult to estimate . It was one of those instances of a comprehensive grasp , associated with habitual luck and characteristic boldness , of which an age presented us but few . But here was Brother Bellows , who had been in the great Bank case , and who could probably tell us more . What did Brother Bellows put this new success at ? Brother Bellows was on his way to make his bow to the bosom , and could only tell them in passing that he had heard it stated , with great appearance of truth , as being worth , from first to last , half - a - million of money . Admiralty said Mr Merdle was a wonderful man , Treasury said he was a new power in the country , and would be able to buy up the whole House of Commons . Bishop said he was glad to think that this wealth flowed into the coffers of a gentleman who was always disposed to maintain the best interests of Society . Mr Merdle himself was usually late on these occasions , as a man still detained in the clutch of giant enterprises when other men had shaken off their dwarfs for the day . On this occasion , he was the last arrival . Treasury said Merdle ’s work punished him a little . Bishop said he was glad to think that this wealth flowed into the coffers of a gentleman who accepted it with meekness . Powder ! There was so much Powder in waiting , that it flavoured the dinner . Pulverous particles got into the dishes , and Society ’s meats had a seasoning of first - rate footmen . Mr Merdle took down a countess who was secluded somewhere in the core of an immense dress , to which she was in the proportion of the heart to the overgrown cabbage . If so low a simile may be admitted , the dress went down the staircase like a richly brocaded Jack in the Green , and nobody knew what sort of small person carried it . Society had everything it could want , and could not want , for dinner . It had everything to look at , and everything to eat , and everything to drink . It is to be hoped it enjoyed itself ; for Mr Merdle ’s own share of the repast might have been paid for with eighteenpence . Mrs Merdle was magnificent . The chief butler was the next magnificent institution of the day . He was the stateliest man in the company . He did nothing , but he looked on as few other men could have done . He was Mr Merdle ’s last gift to Society . Mr Merdle did n’t want him , and was put out of countenance when the great creature looked at him ; but inappeasable Society would have him -- and had got him . The invisible countess carried out the Green at the usual stage of the entertainment , and the file of beauty was closed up by the bosom . Treasury said , Juno . Bishop said , Judith . Bar fell into discussion with Horse Guards concerning courts - martial . Brothers Bellows and Bench struck in . Other magnates paired off . Mr Merdle sat silent , and looked at the table - cloth . Sometimes a magnate addressed him , to turn the stream of his own particular discussion towards him ; but Mr Merdle seldom gave much attention to it , or did more than rouse himself from his calculations and pass the wine . When they rose , so many of the magnates had something to say to Mr Merdle individually that he held little levees by the sideboard , and checked them off as they went out at the door . Treasury hoped he might venture to congratulate one of England ’s world - famed capitalists and merchant - princes ( he had turned that original sentiment in the house a few times , and it came easy to him ) on a new achievement . To extend the triumphs of such men was to extend the triumphs and resources of the nation ; and Treasury felt -- he gave Mr Merdle to understand -- patriotic on the subject . ‘
125955	125960	125962	125962	you	3924	’ said Mr Merdle ; ‘
125978	125979	125975	125975	you	3924	’ ‘
125995	126010	125990	125991	Mr Merdle	273	’ smiling Treasury turned him by the arm towards the sideboard and spoke banteringly , ‘
126026	126033	126016	126016	your	273	’ Mr Merdle felt honoured by the-- ‘
126038	126042	126016	126016	your	273	’ said Treasury , ‘
126133	126366	126367	126367	I	0	’ Mr Merdle intimated that Society was the apple of his eye , and that its claims were paramount to every other consideration . Treasury moved on , and Bar came up . Bar , with his little insinuating jury droop , and fingering his persuasive double eye - glass , hoped he might be excused if he mentioned to one of the greatest converters of the root of all evil into the root of all good , who had for a long time reflected a shining lustre on the annals even of our commercial country -- if he mentioned , disinterestedly , and as , what we lawyers called in our pedantic way , amicus curiae , a fact that had come by accident within his knowledge . He had been required to look over the title of a very considerable estate in one of the eastern counties -- lying , in fact , for Mr Merdle knew we lawyers loved to be particular , on the borders of two of the eastern counties . Now , the title was perfectly sound , and the estate was to be purchased by one who had the command of -- Money ( jury droop and persuasive eye - glass ) , on remarkably advantageous terms . This had come to Bar ’s knowledge only that day , and it had occurred to him , ‘
126395	126716	126389	126389	I	0	’ Such a purchase would involve not only a great legitimate political influence , but some half - dozen church presentations of considerable annual value . Now , that Mr Merdle was already at no loss to discover means of occupying even his capital , and of fully employing even his active and vigorous intellect , Bar well knew : but he would venture to suggest that the question arose in his mind , whether one who had deservedly gained so high a position and so European a reputation did not owe it -- we would not say to himself , but we would say to Society , to possess himself of such influences as these ; and to exercise them -- we would not say for his own , or for his party ’s , but we would say for Society’s -- benefit . Mr Merdle again expressed himself as wholly devoted to that object of his constant consideration , and Bar took his persuasive eye - glass up the grand staircase . Bishop then came undesignedly sidling in the direction of the sideboard . Surely the goods of this world , it occurred in an accidental way to Bishop to remark , could scarcely be directed into happier channels than when they accumulated under the magic touch of the wise and sagacious , who , while they knew the just value of riches ( Bishop tried here to look as if he were rather poor himself ) , were aware of their importance , judiciously governed and rightly distributed , to the welfare of our brethren at large . Mr Merdle with humility expressed his conviction that Bishop could n’t mean him , and with inconsistency expressed his high gratification in Bishop ’s good opinion . Bishop then -- jauntily stepping out a little with his well - shaped right leg , as though he said to Mr Merdle ‘
126727	127157	126389	126389	I	0	’ put this case to his good friend : Whether it had occurred to his good friend , that Society might not unreasonably hope that one so blest in his undertakings , and whose example on his pedestal was so influential with it , would shed a little money in the direction of a mission or so to Africa ? Mr Merdle signifying that the idea should have his best attention , Bishop put another case : Whether his good friend had at all interested himself in the proceedings of our Combined Additional Endowed Dignitaries Committee , and whether it had occurred to him that to shed a little money in _ that _ direction might be a great conception finely executed ? Mr Merdle made a similar reply , and Bishop explained his reason for inquiring . Society looked to such men as his good friend to do such things . It was not that _ he _ looked to them , but that Society looked to them . Just as it was not Our Committee who wanted the Additional Endowed Dignitaries , but it was Society that was in a state of the most agonising uneasiness of mind until it got them . He begged to assure his good friend that he was extremely sensible of his good friend ’s regard on all occasions for the best interests of Society ; and he considered that he was at once consulting those interests and expressing the feeling of Society , when he wished him continued prosperity , continued increase of riches , and continued things in general . Bishop then betook himself up - stairs , and the other magnates gradually floated up after him until there was no one left below but Mr Merdle . That gentleman , after looking at the table - cloth until the soul of the chief butler glowed with a noble resentment , went slowly up after the rest , and became of no account in the stream of people on the grand staircase . Mrs Merdle was at home , the best of the jewels were hung out to be seen , Society got what it came for , Mr Merdle drank twopennyworth of tea in a corner and got more than he wanted . Among the evening magnates was a famous physician , who knew everybody , and whom everybody knew . On entering at the door , he came upon Mr Merdle drinking his tea in a corner , and touched him on the arm . Mr Merdle started . ‘
127164	127165	127162	127162	you	3930	’ ‘
127172	127173	127162	127162	you	3930	’ ‘
127176	127181	127162	127162	you	3930	’ said Mr Merdle , ‘

127234	127526	127230	127230	I	0	’ Bar and Bishop had both been bystanders during this short dialogue , and as Mr Merdle was swept away by the crowd , they made their remarks upon it to the Physician . Bar said , there was a certain point of mental strain beyond which no man could go ; that the point varied with various textures of brain and peculiarities of constitution , as he had had occasion to notice in several of his learned brothers ; but the point of endurance passed by a line ’s breadth , depression and dyspepsia ensued . Not to intrude on the sacred mysteries of medicine , he took it , now ( with the jury droop and persuasive eye - glass ) , that this was Merdle ’s case ? Bishop said that when he was a young man , and had fallen for a brief space into the habit of writing sermons on Saturdays , a habit which all young sons of the church should sedulously avoid , he had frequently been sensible of a depression , arising as he supposed from an over - taxed intellect , upon which the yolk of a new - laid egg , beaten up by the good woman in whose house he at that time lodged , with a glass of sound sherry , nutmeg , and powdered sugar acted like a charm . Without presuming to offer so simple a remedy to the consideration of so profound a professor of the great healing art , he would venture to inquire whether the strain , being by way of intricate calculations , the spirits might not ( humanly speaking ) be restored to their tone by a gentle and yet generous stimulant ? ‘
127529	127534	127230	127230	I	0	’ said the physician , ‘
127666	128330	127652	127652	I	0	’ There was no shadow of Mr Merdle ’s complaint on the bosom now displaying precious stones in rivalry with many similar superb jewel - stands ; there was no shadow of Mr Merdle ’s complaint on young Sparkler hovering about the rooms , monomaniacally seeking any sufficiently ineligible young lady with no nonsense about her ; there was no shadow of Mr Merdle ’s complaint on the Barnacles and Stiltstalkings , of whom whole colonies were present ; or on any of the company . Even on himself , its shadow was faint enough as he moved about among the throng , receiving homage . Mr Merdle ’s complaint . Society and he had so much to do with one another in all things else , that it is hard to imagine his complaint , if he had one , being solely his own affair . Had he that deep - seated recondite complaint , and did any doctor find it out ? Patience , in the meantime , the shadow of the Marshalsea wall was a real darkening influence , and could be seen on the Dorrit Family at any stage of the sun ’s course . CHAPTER 22 . A Puzzle Mr Clennam did not increase in favour with the Father of the Marshalsea in the ratio of his increasing visits . His obtuseness on the great Testimonial question was not calculated to awaken admiration in the paternal breast , but had rather a tendency to give offence in that sensitive quarter , and to be regarded as a positive shortcoming in point of gentlemanly feeling . An impression of disappointment , occasioned by the discovery that Mr Clennam scarcely possessed that delicacy for which , in the confidence of his nature , he had been inclined to give him credit , began to darken the fatherly mind in connection with that gentleman . The father went so far as to say , in his private family circle , that he feared Mr Clennam was not a man of high instincts . He was happy , he observed , in his public capacity as leader and representative of the College , to receive Mr Clennam when he called to pay his respects ; but he did n’t find that he got on with him personally . There appeared to be something ( he did n’t know what it was ) wanting in him . Howbeit , the father did not fail in any outward show of politeness , but , on the contrary , honoured him with much attention ; perhaps cherishing the hope that , although not a man of a sufficiently brilliant and spontaneous turn of mind to repeat his former testimonial unsolicited , it might still be within the compass of his nature to bear the part of a responsive gentleman , in any correspondence that way tending . In the threefold capacity , of the gentleman from outside who had been accidentally locked in on the night of his first appearance , of the gentleman from outside who had inquired into the affairs of the Father of the Marshalsea with the stupendous idea of getting him out , and of the gentleman from outside who took an interest in the child of the Marshalsea , Clennam soon became a visitor of mark . He was not surprised by the attentions he received from Mr Chivery when that officer was on the lock , for he made little distinction between Mr Chivery ’s politeness and that of the other turnkeys . It was on one particular afternoon that Mr Chivery surprised him all at once , and stood forth from his companions in bold relief . Mr Chivery , by some artful exercise of his power of clearing the Lodge , had contrived to rid it of all sauntering Collegians ; so that Clennam , coming out of the prison , should find him on duty alone . ‘
128341	128350	128334	128334	I	0	’ said Mr Chivery in a secret manner ; ‘

128586	128770	128582	128584	Mrs _ Chivery	451	’ These instructions , Mr Chivery , who had already let him out , cautiously called through a little slide in the outer door , which he could draw back from within for the inspection of visitors when it pleased him . Arthur Clennam , with the card in his hand , betook himself to the address set forth upon it , and speedily arrived there . It was a very small establishment , wherein a decent woman sat behind the counter working at her needle . Little jars of tobacco , little boxes of cigars , a little assortment of pipes , a little jar or two of snuff , and a little instrument like a shoeing horn for serving it out , composed the retail stock in trade . Arthur mentioned his name , and his having promised to call , on the solicitation of Mr Chivery . About something relating to Miss Dorrit , he believed . Mrs Chivery at once laid aside her work , rose up from her seat behind the counter , and deploringly shook her head . ‘
128777	128781	128771	128771	You	3940	’ said she , ‘
128791	128895	128897	128897	John	449	’ With these mysterious words , she preceded the visitor into a little parlour behind the shop , with a little window in it commanding a very little dull back - yard . In this yard a wash of sheets and table - cloths tried ( in vain , for want of air ) to get itself dried on a line or two ; and among those flapping articles was sitting in a chair , like the last mariner left alive on the deck of a damp ship without the power of furling the sails , a little woe - begone young man . ‘
128899	128920	128897	128897	John	449	’ said Mrs Chivery . Not to be deficient in interest , Clennam asked what he might be doing there ? ‘
128929	128939	128940	128940	He	3941	’ said Mrs Chivery , shaking her head afresh . ‘
128968	128992	128993	128994	Mrs Chivery	451	’ eyes off , he ’ll sit there , hours . Hours he will . Says he feels as if it was groves ! ’
129022	129031	129033	129034	Mrs Chivery	451	‘ Please to take a seat , sir , ’
129036	129080	129033	129034	Mrs Chivery	451	‘ Miss Dorrit is the matter with Our John , sir ; he ’s a breaking his heart for her , and I would wish to take the liberty to ask how it ’s to be made good to his parents when bust ? ’
129124	129127	129129	129129	she	451	‘ Sir , ’

If you can promote views calculated to make two young people happy , let me , for Our John ’s sake , and for both their sakes , implore you so to do ! ’
129191	129198	129200	129200	Arthur	304	‘ I have been so habituated , ’
129206	129258	129200	129200	Arthur	304	‘ during the short time I have known her , to consider Little -- I have been so habituated to consider Miss Dorrit in a light altogether removed from that in which you present her to me , that you quite take me by surprise . Does she know your son ? ’

129307	129364	129297	129298	Mrs Chivery	451	‘ she never could have seen him on a Sunday without knowing he was that . His cane alone would have told it long ago , if nothing else had . Young men like John do n’t take to ivory hands a pinting , for nothing . How did I first know it myself ? Similarly . ’
129365	129380	129200	129200	Arthur	304	‘ Perhaps Miss Dorrit may not be so ready as you , you see . ’
129381	129389	129391	129392	Mrs Chivery	451	‘ Then she knows it , sir , ’
129394	129400	129391	129392	Mrs Chivery	451	‘ by word of mouth . ’

129407	129410	129412	129413	Mrs Chivery	451	‘ Sir , ’
129415	129468	129412	129413	Mrs Chivery	451	‘ sure and certain as in this house I am . I see my son go out with my own eyes when in this house I was , and I see my son come in with my own eyes when in this house I was , and I know he done it ! ’
129484	129505	129469	129470	Mrs Chivery	451	‘ May I ask you how he came to fall into the desponding state which causes you so much uneasiness ? ’
129506	129509	129511	129512	Mrs Chivery	451	‘ That , ’
129514	129575	129511	129512	Mrs Chivery	451	‘ took place on that same day when to this house I see that John with these eyes return . Never been himself in this house since . Never was like what he has been since , not from the hour when to this house seven year ago me and his father , as tenants by the quarter , came ! ’
129598	129612	129590	129591	Mrs Chivery	451	‘ May I venture to inquire what is your version of the matter ? ’
129613	129617	129619	129620	Mrs Chivery	451	‘ You may , ’
129622	129900	129619	129620	Mrs Chivery	451	‘ and I will give it to you in honour and in word as true as in this shop I stand . Our John has every one ’s good word and every one ’s good wish . He played with her as a child when in that yard a child she played . He has known her ever since . He went out upon the Sunday afternoon when in this very parlour he had dined , and met her , with appointment or without appointment ; which , I do not pretend to say . He made his offer to her . Her brother and sister is high in their views , and against Our John . Her father is all for himself in his views and against sharing her with any one . Under which circumstances she has answered Our John , “ No , John , I can not have you , I can not have any husband , it is not my intentions ever to become a wife , it is my intentions to be always a sacrifice , farewell , find another worthy of you , and forget me ! ” This is the way in which she is doomed to be a constant slave to them that are not worthy that a constant slave she unto them should be . This is the way in which Our John has come to find no pleasure but in taking cold among the linen , and in showing in that yard , as in that yard I have myself shown you , a broken - down ruin that goes home to his mother ’s heart ! ’
130530	130536	130537	130537	he	1240	‘ Have I startled you ? ’
130540	130548	130549	130549	she	274	‘ I thought I knew the step , ’
130554	130571	130549	130549	she	274	‘ And did you know it , Little Dorrit ? You could hardly have expected mine . ’
130572	130594	130635	130635	his	1240	‘ I did not expect any . But when I heard a step , I thought it -- sounded like yours . ’
130595	130601	130638	130638	she	274	‘ Are you going further ? ’
130602	130617	130618	130618	They	3967	‘ No , sir , I am only walking here for a little change . ’
130645	130673	130638	130638	she	274	‘ It is so strange . Perhaps you can hardly understand it . I sometimes have a sensation as if it was almost unfeeling to walk here . ’
130674	130677	130638	130638	she	274	‘ Unfeeling ? ’
130678	130717	130638	130638	she	274	‘ To see the river , and so much sky , and so many objects , and such change and motion . Then to go back , you know , and find him in the same cramped place . ’
130718	130745	130638	130638	she	274	‘ Ah yes ! But going back , you must remember that you take with you the spirit and influence of such things to cheer him . ’
130746	130786	130638	130638	she	274	‘ Do I ? I hope I may ! I am afraid you fancy too much , sir , and make me out too powerful . If you were in prison , could I bring such comfort to you ? ’
130787	130799	130800	130800	He	3968	‘ Yes , Little Dorrit , I am sure of it . ’
130977	130988	130958	130958	She	3969	‘ Maggy , you promised me to stop near father . ’
130989	131045	131054	131054	Lor	489	‘ So I would , Little Mother , only he would n’t let me . If he takes and sends me out I must go . If he takes and says , “ Maggy , you hurry away and back with that letter , and you shall have a sixpence if the answer ’s a good ‘
131109	131167	131104	131104	I	0	’m a going So and So , ” and if he says , “ I ’ll have a Try too , ” and if he goes into the George and writes a letter and if he gives it me and says , “ Take that one to the same place , and if the answer ’s a good ‘
131185	131206	131207	131207	I	0	’ Arthur read , in Little Dorrit ’s downcast eyes , to whom she foresaw that the letters were addressed . ‘
131208	131226	131228	131228	Maggy	358	’m a going So and So . There ! That ’s where I am a going to , ’
131230	131232	131228	131228	Maggy	358	‘ I ’m
131263	131270	131258	131258	you	953	’ said Maggy , addressing Arthur . ‘
131286	131291	131258	131258	you	953	‘ em to you . ’
131292	131309	131311	131311	Clennam	304	‘ We will not be so particular as that , Maggy . Give them me here , ’
131317	131327	131311	131311	Clennam	304	‘ Well , then , come across the road , ’
131336	131397	131329	131329	Maggy	358	‘ Little Mother was n’t to know nothing of it , and she would never have known nothing of it if you had only gone So and So , instead of bothering and loitering about . It ai n’t my fault . I must do what I am told . They ought to be ashamed of themselves for telling me . ’
131796	131810	131790	131790	she	3986	‘ I think I had better go . I had better go home . ’
131811	131817	131819	131819	Clennam	304	‘ Do n’t be distressed , ’
131821	131842	131790	131790	she	3986	‘ I have answered the letters . They were nothing . You know what they were . They were nothing . ’
131843	131849	131850	131850	she	3986	‘ But I am afraid , ’
131853	131885	131850	131850	she	3986	‘ to leave him , I am afraid to leave any of them . When I am gone , they pervert -- but they do n’t mean it -- even Maggy . ’
131886	131922	131790	131790	she	3986	‘ It was a very innocent commission that she undertook , poor thing . And in keeping it secret from you , she supposed , no doubt , that she was only saving you uneasiness . ’
131923	132025	132031	132031	she	3988	‘ Yes , I hope so , I hope so . But I had better go home ! It was but the other day that my sister told me I had become so used to the prison that I had its tone and character . It must be so . I am sure it must be when I see these things . My place is there . I am better there , it is unfeeling in me to be here , when I can do the least thing there . Good - bye . I had far better stay at home ! ’
132066	132076	132077	132077	he	304	‘ Do n’t call it home , my child ! ’
132080	132094	132077	132077	he	304	‘ It is always painful to me to hear you call it home . ’
132095	132119	132031	132031	she	3988	‘ But it is home ! What else can I call home ? Why should I ever forget it for a single moment ? ’
132120	132136	132031	132031	she	3988	‘ You never do , dear Little Dorrit , in any good and true service . ’
132137	132194	132195	132195	He	3989	‘ I hope not , O I hope not ! But it is better for me to stay there ; much better , much more dutiful , much happier . Please do n’t go with me , let me go by myself . Good - bye , God bless you . Thank you , thank you . ’
132510	132520	132521	132521	he	304	‘ Doyce is highly gratified by your good opinion , ’
132528	132646	132648	132649	Mr Meagles	288	‘ and desires nothing so much as that you should examine the affairs of the Works for yourself , and entirely understand them . He has handed me the keys of all his books and papers -- here they are jingling in this pocket -- and the only charge he has given me is “ Let Mr Clennam have the means of putting himself on a perfect equality with me as to knowing whatever I know . If it should come to nothing after all , he will respect my confidence . Unless I was sure of that to begin with , I should have nothing to do with him . ” And there , you see , ’
132651	132659	132648	132649	Mr Meagles	288	‘ you have Daniel Doyce all over . ’
132660	132666	132521	132521	he	304	‘ A very honourable character . ’
132667	132700	132702	132703	Mr Meagles	288	‘ Oh , yes , to be sure . Not a doubt of it . Odd , but very honourable . Very odd though . Now , would you believe , Clennam , ’
132715	132729	132702	132703	Mr Meagles	288	‘ that I had a whole morning in What’s - his - name Yard-- ’
132730	132734	132521	132521	he	304	‘ Bleeding Heart ? ’
132735	132756	132521	132521	he	304	‘ A whole morning in Bleeding Heart Yard , before I could induce him to pursue the subject at all ? ’
132757	132762	132702	132703	Mr Meagles	288	‘ How was that ? ’
132763	132786	132521	132521	he	304	‘ How was that , my friend ? I no sooner mentioned your name in connection with it than he declared off . ’
132787	132794	132521	132521	he	304	‘ Declared off on my account ? ’
132795	132851	132853	132854	Mr Meagles	288	‘ I no sooner mentioned your name , Clennam , than he said , “ That will never do ! ” What did he mean by that ? I asked him . No matter , Meagles ; that would never do . Why would it never do ? You ’ll hardly believe it , Clennam , ’
132860	132978	132858	132858	himself	288	‘ but it came out that it would never do , because you and he , walking down to Twickenham together , had glided into a friendly conversation in the course of which he had referred to his intention of taking a partner , supposing at the time that you were as firmly and finally settled as St Paul ’s Cathedral . “ Whereas , ” says he , “ Mr Clennam might now believe , if I entertained his proposition , that I had a sinister and designing motive in what was open free speech . Which I ca n’t bear , ” says he , “ which I really am too proud to bear . ” ’
132979	132985	132521	132521	he	304	‘ I should as soon suspect-- ’
132986	132992	132994	132995	Mr Meagles	288	‘ Of course you would , ’
132997	133160	133162	133163	Mr Meagles	288	‘ and so I told him . But it took a morning to scale that wall ; and I doubt if any other man than myself ( he likes me of old ) could have got his leg over it . Well , Clennam . This business - like obstacle surmounted , he then stipulated that before resuming with you I should look over the books and form my own opinion . I looked over the books , and formed my own opinion . “ Is it , on the whole , for , or against ? ” says he . “ For , ” says I. “ Then , ” says he , “ you may now , my good friend , give Mr Clennam the means of forming his opinion . To enable him to do which , without bias and with perfect freedom , I shall go out of town for a week . ” And he ’s gone , ’
133165	133175	133162	133163	Mr Meagles	288	‘ that ’s the rich conclusion of the thing . ’
133176	133180	133182	133182	Clennam	304	‘ Leaving me , ’
133184	133199	133182	133182	Clennam	304	‘ with a high sense , I must say , of his candour and his-- ’
133200	133203	133204	133205	Mr Meagles	288	‘ Oddity , ’
133209	133215	133204	133205	Mr Meagles	288	‘ I should think so ! ’
133238	133242	133244	133245	Mr Meagles	288	‘ And now , ’
133247	133285	133244	133245	Mr Meagles	288	‘ you can begin to look into matters as soon as you think proper . I have undertaken to explain where you may want explanation , but to be strictly impartial , and to do nothing more . ’
133614	133624	133626	133626	he	288	‘ And I may now avow , Mr Clennam , ’
133636	133662	133626	133626	he	288	‘ that if I had looked high and low for a partner , I believe I could not have found one more to my mind . ’
133663	133669	133671	133671	Clennam	304	‘ I say the same , ’
133673	133682	133684	133685	Mr Meagles	288	‘ And I say of both of you , ’
133687	133718	133684	133685	Mr Meagles	288	‘ that you are well matched . You keep him in check , Clennam , with your common sense , and you stick to the Works , Dan , with your-- ’
133719	133723	133725	133725	Daniel	374	‘ Uncommon sense ? ’
133732	133775	133725	133725	Daniel	374	‘ You may call it so , if you like -- and each of you will be a right hand to the other . Here ’s my own right hand upon it , as a practical man , to both of you . ’
134343	134408	134340	134340	she	499	‘ Good gracious , Arthur,--I should say Mr Clennam , far more proper -- the climb we have had to get up here and how ever to get down again without a fire - escape and Mr F. ’s Aunt slipping through the steps and bruised all over and you in the machinery and foundry way too only think , and never told us ! ’
134435	134548	134428	134428	her	2757	‘ Most unkind never to have come back to see us since that day , though naturally it was not to be expected that there should be any attraction at _ our _ house and you were much more pleasantly engaged , that ’s pretty certain , and is she fair or dark blue eyes or black I wonder , not that I expect that she should be anything but a perfect contrast to me in all particulars for I am a disappointment as I very well know and you are quite right to be devoted no doubt though what I am saying Arthur never mind I hardly know myself Good gracious ! ’
134578	134593	134595	134595	Flora	499	‘ And to think of Doyce and Clennam , and who Doyce can be , ’
134597	134656	134595	134595	Flora	499	‘ delightful man no doubt and married perhaps or perhaps a daughter , now has he really ? then one understands the partnership and sees it all , do n’t tell me anything about it for I know I have no claim to ask the question the golden chain that once was forged being snapped and very proper . ’
134674	134757	134657	134657	Flora	499	‘ Dear Arthur -- force of habit , Mr Clennam every way more delicate and adapted to existing circumstances -- I must beg to be excused for taking the liberty of this intrusion but I thought I might so far presume upon old times for ever faded never more to bloom as to call with Mr F. ’s Aunt to congratulate and offer best wishes , A great deal superior to China not to be denied and much nearer though higher up ! ’
134758	134767	134769	134769	Clennam	304	‘ I am very happy to see you , ’
134771	134786	134769	134769	Clennam	304	‘ and I thank you , Flora , very much for your kind remembrance . ’
134787	134798	134800	134800	Flora	499	‘ More than I can say myself at any rate , ’
134802	134851	134800	134800	Flora	499	‘ for I might have been dead and buried twenty distinct times over and no doubt whatever should have been before you had genuinely remembered Me or anything like it in spite of which one last remark I wish to make , one last explanation I wish to offer-- ’
134852	134858	134859	134859	Arthur	304	‘ My dear Mrs Finching , ’
134864	134874	134859	134859	Arthur	304	‘ Oh not that disagreeable name , say Flora ! ’
134875	134905	134800	134800	Flora	499	‘ Flora , is it worth troubling yourself afresh to enter into explanations ? I assure you none are needed . I am satisfied -- I am perfectly satisfied . ’
134925	134936	134916	134916	Aunt	4034	‘ There ’s mile - stones on the Dover road ! ’
135073	135082	135067	135069	that illustrious woman	4038	‘ Let him meet it if he can ! ’
135120	135125	135127	135127	Flora	499	‘ One last remark , ’
135129	135271	135127	135127	Flora	499	‘ I was going to say I wish to make one last explanation I wish to offer , Mr F. ’s Aunt and myself would not have intruded on business hours Mr F. having been in business and though the wine trade still business is equally business call it what you will and business habits are just the same as witness Mr F. himself who had his slippers always on the mat at ten minutes before six in the afternoon and his boots inside the fender at ten minutes before eight in the morning to the moment in all weathers light or dark -- would not therefore have intruded without a motive which being kindly meant it may be hoped will be kindly taken Arthur , Mr Clennam far more proper , even Doyce and Clennam probably more business - like . ’
135272	135282	135283	135283	Arthur	304	‘ Pray say nothing in the way of apology , ’
135286	135292	135283	135283	Arthur	304	‘ You are always welcome . ’
135293	135417	135127	135127	Flora	499	‘ Very polite of you to say so Arthur -- cannot remember Mr Clennam until the word is out , such is the habit of times for ever fled , and so true it is that oft in the stilly night ere slumber ’s chain has bound people , fond memory brings the light of other days around people -- very polite but more polite than true I am afraid , for to go into the machinery business without so much as sending a line or a card to papa -- I do n’t say me though there was a time but that is past and stern reality has now my gracious never mind -- does not look like it you must confess . ’
135444	135448	135449	135449	she	499	‘ Though indeed , ’
135453	135619	135449	135449	she	499	‘ nothing else is to be expected and why should it be expected and if it ’s not to be expected why should it be , and I am far from blaming you or any one , When your mama and my papa worried us to death and severed the golden bowl -- I mean bond but I dare say you know what I mean and if you do n’t you do n’t lose much and care just as little I will venture to add -- when they severed the golden bond that bound us and threw us into fits of crying on the sofa nearly choked at least myself everything was changed and in giving my hand to Mr F. I know I did so with my eyes open but he was so very unsettled and in such low spirits that he had distractedly alluded to the river if not oil of something from the chemist ’s and I did it for the best . ’
135620	135636	135812	135812	she	499	‘ My good Flora , we settled that before . It was all quite right . ’
135637	135646	135648	135648	Flora	499	‘ It ’s perfectly clear you think so , ’
135650	135723	135648	135648	Flora	499	‘ for you take it very coolly , if I had n’t known it to be China I should have guessed myself the Polar regions , dear Mr Clennam you are right however and I can not blame you but as to Doyce and Clennam papa ’s property being about here we heard it from Pancks and but for him we never should have heard one word about it I am satisfied . ’
135724	135734	135812	135812	she	499	‘ No , no , do n’t say that . ’
135735	135773	135648	135648	Flora	499	‘ What nonsense not to say it Arthur -- Doyce and Clennam -- easier and less trying to me than Mr Clennam -- when I know it and you know it too and ca n’t deny it . ’
135774	135793	135812	135812	she	499	‘ But I do deny it , Flora . I should soon have made you a friendly visit . ’
135794	135797	135799	135799	Flora	499	‘ Ah ! ’
135805	135810	135812	135812	she	499	‘ I dare say ! ’
135821	135893	135812	135812	she	499	‘ However when Pancks told us I made up my mind that Mr F. ’s Aunt and I would come and call because when papa -- which was before that -- happened to mention her name to me and to say that you were interested in her I said at the moment Good gracious why not have her here then when there ’s anything to do instead of putting it out . ’
135894	135900	135902	135902	Clennam	304	‘ When you say Her , ’
135911	135917	135902	135902	Clennam	304	‘ do you mean Mr F.’s-- ’
135918	135952	135812	135812	she	499	‘ My goodness , Arthur -- Doyce and Clennam really easier to me with old remembrances -- who ever heard of Mr F. ’s Aunt doing needlework and going out by the day ? ’
135953	135967	135902	135902	Clennam	304	‘ Going out by the day ! Do you speak of Little Dorrit ? ’
135968	135974	135976	135976	Flora	499	‘ Why yes of course , ’
135978	136035	135976	135976	Flora	499	‘ and of all the strangest names I ever heard the strangest , like a place down in the country with a turnpike , or a favourite pony or a puppy or a bird or something from a seed - shop to be put in a garden or a flower - pot and come up speckled . ’
136036	136041	136043	136043	Arthur	304	‘ Then , Flora , ’
136053	136075	136043	136043	Arthur	304	‘ Mr Casby was so kind as to mention Little Dorrit to you , was he ? What did he say ? ’
136076	136084	136086	136086	Flora	499	‘ Oh you know what papa is , ’
136088	136168	136086	136086	Flora	499	‘ and how aggravatingly he sits looking beautiful and turning his thumbs over and over one another till he makes one giddy if one keeps one ’s eyes upon him , he said when we were talking of you -- I do n’t know who began the subject Arthur ( Doyce and Clennam ) but I am sure it was n’t me , at least I hope not but you really must excuse my confessing more on that point . ’
136169	136172	136174	136174	Arthur	304	‘ Certainly , ’
136176	136181	136174	136174	Arthur	304	‘ By all means . ’
136182	136188	136190	136190	Flora	499	‘ You are very ready , ’
136202	136232	136190	136190	Flora	499	‘ that I must admit , Papa said you had spoken of her in an earnest way and I said what I have told you and that ’s all . ’
136233	136238	136240	136240	Arthur	304	‘ That ’s all ? ’
136246	136351	136240	136240	Arthur	304	‘ Except that when Pancks told us of your having embarked in this business and with difficulty persuaded us that it was really you I said to Mr F. ’s Aunt then we would come and ask you if it would be agreeable to all parties that she should be engaged at our house when required for I know she often goes to your mama ’s and I know that your mama has a very touchy temper Arthur -- Doyce and Clennam -- or I never might have married Mr F. and might have been at this hour but I am running into nonsense . ’
136352	136367	136368	136369	Poor Flora	4041	‘ It was very kind of you , Flora , to think of this . ’
136428	136434	136435	136435	he	4043	‘ I think , Flora , ’
136438	136455	136435	136435	he	4043	‘ that the employment you can give Little Dorrit , and the kindness you can show her-- ’
136456	136462	136464	136464	Flora	499	‘ Yes and I will , ’
136468	136601	136604	136604	he	4045	‘ I am sure of it -- will be a great assistance and support to her . I do not feel that I have the right to tell you what I know of her , for I acquired the knowledge confidentially , and under circumstances that bind me to silence . But I have an interest in the little creature , and a respect for her that I can not express to you . Her life has been one of such trial and devotion , and such quiet goodness , as you can scarcely imagine . I can hardly think of her , far less speak of her , without feeling moved . Let that feeling represent what I could tell you , and commit her to your friendliness with my thanks . ’
136690	136702	136684	136684	she	499	‘ Papa ! Hush , Arthur , for Mercy ’s sake ! ’
136771	136777	136779	136780	the Patriarch	11047	‘ I heard from Flora , ’
136786	136815	136782	136782	his	11047	‘ that she was coming to call , coming to call . And being out , I thought I ’d come also , thought I ’d come also . ’
136883	136907	136871	136871	he	4045	‘ And you are in a new business , Mr Clennam ? I wish you well , sir , I wish you well ! ’
136916	136926	136928	136928	Arthur	304	‘ Mrs Finching has been telling me , sir , ’
136957	136981	136982	136983	The Patriarch	11047	‘ that she hopes occasionally to employ the young needlewoman you recommended to my mother . For which I have been thanking her . ’
137015	137025	137027	137027	Pancks	396	‘ You did n’t recommend her , you know , ’
137029	137065	137027	137027	Pancks	396	‘ how could you ? You knew nothing about her , you did n’t . The name was mentioned to you , and you passed it on . That ’s what _ you _ did . ’
137066	137069	137071	137071	Clennam	304	‘ Well ! ’
137073	137087	137071	137071	Clennam	304	‘ As she justifies any recommendation , it is much the same thing . ’
137088	137097	137099	137099	Pancks	396	‘ You are glad she turns out well , ’
137101	137151	137099	137099	Pancks	396	‘ but it would n’t have been your fault if she had turned out ill . The credit ’s not yours as it is , and the blame would n’t have been yours as it might have been . You gave no guarantee . You knew nothing about her . ’
137152	137160	137162	137162	Arthur	304	‘ You are not acquainted , then , ’
137169	137176	137162	137162	Arthur	304	‘ with any of her family ? ’
137177	137185	137187	137187	Pancks	396	‘ Acquainted with any of her family ? ’
137189	137205	137206	137206	em	4055	‘ How should you be acquainted with any of her family ? You never heard of ‘
137228	137250	137223	137223	You	4056	’ All this time the Patriarch sat serenely smiling ; nodding or shaking his head benevolently , as the case required . ‘
137257	137261	137262	137262	you	4056	’ said Pancks , ‘
137307	137317	137338	137358	A person who ca n’t pay , gets another person who ca n’t pay , to guarantee that he can pay	4066	‘ em . What would be the good of letting ‘
137418	137485	137486	137486	You	4056	’ Mr Pancks concluded by blowing off that steam of his . A momentary silence that ensued was broken by Mr F. ’s Aunt , who had been sitting upright in a cataleptic state since her last public remark . She now underwent a violent twitch , calculated to produce a startling effect on the nerves of the uninitiated , and with the deadliest animosity observed : ‘
137523	137537	137540	137540	ma’am	10131	’ Mr Pancks was not slow to reply , with his usual calmness , ‘
137547	137553	137555	137555	his	296	’m surprised to hear it . ’
137650	137665	137645	137646	Mr F.	411	‘ very lively to - day , and she thought they had better go . ’
137699	137712	137714	137714	him	296	‘ He’--too evidently meaning Clennam -- wanted to get rid of her , ‘
137721	137729	137730	137730	Him	296	’ and urgently expressing her desire to see ‘
137731	137795	137730	137730	Him	296	’ perform that ceremony . In this dilemma , Mr Pancks , whose resources appeared equal to any emergency in the Patriarchal waters , slipped on his hat , slipped out at the counting - house door , and slipped in again a moment afterwards with an artificial freshness upon him , as if he had been in the country for some weeks . ‘
137804	137817	137820	137820	you	10131	’ said Mr Pancks , rubbing up his hair in great astonishment , ‘
137875	138189	138190	138191	Mr F.	411	’ And so escorted Mr F. ’s Aunt down the private staircase of the counting - house with great gallantry and success . The patriarchal Mr Casby then rose with the air of having done it himself , and blandly followed : leaving his daughter , as she followed in her turn , to remark to her former lover in a distracted whisper ( which she very much enjoyed ) , that they had drained the cup of life to the dregs ; and further to hint mysteriously that the late Mr F. was at the bottom of it . Alone again , Clennam became a prey to his old doubts in reference to his mother and Little Dorrit , and revolved the old thoughts and suspicions . They were all in his mind , blending themselves with the duties he was mechanically discharging , when a shadow on his papers caused him to look up for the cause . The cause was Mr Pancks . With his hat thrown back upon his ears as if his wiry prongs of hair had darted up like springs and cast it off , with his jet - black beads of eyes inquisitively sharp , with the fingers of his right hand in his mouth that he might bite the nails , and with the fingers of his left hand in reserve in his pocket for another course , Mr Pancks cast his shadow through the glass upon the books and papers . Mr Pancks asked , with a little inquiring twist of his head , if he might come in again ? Clennam replied with a nod of his head in the affirmative . Mr Pancks worked his way in , came alongside the desk , made himself fast by leaning his arms upon it , and started conversation with a puff and a snort . ‘
138200	138204	138197	138197	I	0	’ said Clennam . ‘
138210	138214	138197	138197	I	0	’ said Pancks . ‘
138233	138237	138230	138231	that lady	2783	’ said Clennam . ‘
138243	138244	138239	138239	you	0	’ ‘
138252	138256	138247	138247	she	2783	’ said Pancks . ‘
138261	138262	138247	138247	she	2783	’ ‘
138269	138324	138264	138264	I	0	’ said Pancks . He took out his note - book , opened it , shut it , dropped it into his hat , which was beside him on the desk , and looked in at it as it lay at the bottom of the hat : all with a great appearance of consideration . ‘
138328	138333	138325	138326	Mr Clennam	304	’ he then began , ‘
138343	138344	138264	138264	I	0	’ ‘
138350	138354	138264	138264	I	0	’ asked Clennam . ‘
138357	138361	138264	138264	I	0	’ said Pancks . ‘
138382	138383	138386	138386	sir	933	’ ‘
138396	138400	138390	138390	I	0	’ said Pancks , ‘
138437	138468	138435	138435	sir	933	’ Mr Pancks blew off his peculiar noise again , and fell to at his right - hand nails . Arthur looked searchingly at him ; he returned the look . ‘
138478	138479	138473	138473	you	396	’ ‘
138491	138492	138485	138485	I	0	’ ‘
138501	138502	138496	138496	you	933	’ ‘
138511	138534	138504	138504	you	933	’ This comprehensive summary of his desires was not discharged without some heavy labouring on the part of Mr Pancks ’s machinery . ‘
138563	138564	138551	138551	you	933	’ ‘
138572	138576	138551	138551	you	933	’ returned Pancks . ‘
138623	138694	138714	138715	my proprietor	4091	’ With his former doubt whether this dry hard personage were quite in earnest , Clennam again turned his eyes attentively upon his face . It was as scrubby and dingy as ever , and as eager and quick as ever , and he could see nothing lurking in it that was at all expressive of a latent mockery that had seemed to strike upon his ear in the voice . ‘
138697	138701	138714	138715	my proprietor	4091	’ said Pancks , ‘
138718	138719	138714	138715	my proprietor	4091	’ ‘
138730	138734	138735	138736	My proprietor	4091	’ Pancks nodded . ‘
138829	138830	138822	138823	Mr Clennam	304	’ ‘
138833	138834	138822	138823	Mr Clennam	304	’ ‘
138839	138843	138846	138846	I	0	’ returned Pancks , ‘
138857	138938	138854	138854	I	0	’ With those prongs of hair sticking up all over his head , and his breath coming and going very hard and short , the busy Pancks fell back a step ( in Tug metaphor , took half a turn astern ) as if to show his dingy hull complete , then forged a - head again , and directed his quick glance by turns into his hat where his note - book was , and into Clennam ’s face . ‘
138969	138970	138854	138854	I	0	’ ‘
138974	138988	138854	138854	I	0	’ said Pancks , holding up his dirty forefinger with his broken nail . ‘
138999	139000	138995	138995	your	396	’ ‘
139003	139004	138995	138995	your	396	’ ‘
139007	139011	138995	138995	your	396	’ said Pancks , ‘
139045	139058	139043	139043	Dorrit	274	’ said Pancks , with his forefinger still up as a caution . ‘
139066	139067	139043	139043	Dorrit	274	’ ‘
139080	139124	139075	139075	you	396	’ Mr Pancks fished up his note - book before the question was put , and buttoning it with care in an inner breast - pocket , and looking straight at Clennam all the time , replied with a pause and a puff , ‘
139133	139483	139075	139075	you	396	’ Clennam could not withhold a smile , as the panting little steam - tug , so useful to that unwieldy ship , the Casby , waited on and watched him as if it were seeking an opportunity of running in and rifling him of all he wanted before he could resist its manoeuvres ; though there was that in Mr Pancks ’s eagerness , too , which awakened many wondering speculations in his mind . After a little consideration , he resolved to supply Mr Pancks with such leading information as it was in his power to impart him ; well knowing that Mr Pancks , if he failed in his present research , was pretty sure to find other means of getting it . He , therefore , first requesting Mr Pancks to remember his voluntary declaration that his proprietor had no part in the disclosure , and that his own intentions were good ( two declarations which that coaly little gentleman with the greatest ardour repeated ) , openly told him that as to the Dorrit lineage or former place of habitation , he had no information to communicate , and that his knowledge of the family did not extend beyond the fact that it appeared to be now reduced to five members ; namely , to two brothers , of whom one was single , and one a widower with three children . The ages of the whole family he made known to Mr Pancks , as nearly as he could guess at them ; and finally he described to him the position of the Father of the Marshalsea , and the course of time and events through which he had become invested with that character . To all this , Mr Pancks , snorting and blowing in a more and more portentous manner as he became more interested , listened with great attention ; appearing to derive the most agreeable sensations from the painfullest parts of the narrative , and particularly to be quite charmed by the account of William Dorrit ’s long imprisonment . ‘
139490	139494	139487	139488	Mr Pancks	396	’ said Arthur , ‘
139527	139534	139546	139549	a man of business	11335	’ ( Mr Pancks nodded ) , ‘
139556	139570	139546	139549	a man of business	11335	’ For Mr Pancks had suddenly made that blowing effort with unusual force . ‘
139575	139579	139546	139549	a man of business	11335	’ said Pancks . ‘
139653	139657	139645	139645	I	0	’ continued Clennam ; ‘
139696	139701	139690	139690	I	0	’ Mr Pancks laughed . ‘
139709	139713	139707	139707	sir	933	’ said he . ‘
139722	139779	139714	139714	You	933	’ After that , he stood a little while looking at Clennam , and biting his ten nails all round ; evidently while he fixed in his mind what he had been told , and went over it carefully , before the means of supplying a gap in his memory should be no longer at hand . ‘
139785	139791	139714	139714	You	933	’ he said at last , ‘
139825	139826	139818	139823	A lame foreigner with a stick	4111	’ ‘
139841	139845	139831	139831	You	933	’ said Clennam . ‘
139853	139857	139831	139831	You	933	’ replied Pancks . ‘
139901	139902	139903	139903	I	0	’ ‘
139906	139910	139903	139903	I	0	’ said Clennam , ‘
139918	139919	139912	139912	I	0	’ ‘
139933	139947	139949	139949	my	0	’ said Pancks , making a note of the case in his book , ‘
140016	140017	140006	140006	He	4113	’ ‘
140034	140035	140027	140027	He	4113	’ ‘
140056	140068	140069	140069	I	0	’ said Pancks . And again blew off that remarkable sound . ‘
140076	140602	140069	140069	I	0	’ said Clennam , coldly . Mr Pancks , being by that time quite ready for a start , got under steam in a moment , and , without any other signal or ceremony , was snorting down the step - ladder and working into Bleeding Heart Yard , before he seemed to be well out of the counting - house . Throughout the remainder of the day , Bleeding Heart Yard was in consternation , as the grim Pancks cruised in it ; haranguing the inhabitants on their backslidings in respect of payment , demanding his bond , breathing notices to quit and executions , running down defaulters , sending a swell of terror on before him , and leaving it in his wake . Knots of people , impelled by a fatal attraction , lurked outside any house in which he was known to be , listening for fragments of his discourses to the inmates ; and , when he was rumoured to be coming down the stairs , often could not disperse so quickly but that he would be prematurely in among them , demanding their own arrears , and rooting them to the spot . Throughout the remainder of the day , Mr Pancks ’s What were they up to ? and What did they mean by it ? sounded all over the Yard . Mr Pancks would n’t hear of excuses , would n’t hear of complaints , would n’t hear of repairs , would n’t hear of anything but unconditional money down . Perspiring and puffing and darting about in eccentric directions , and becoming hotter and dingier every moment , he lashed the tide of the yard into a most agitated and turbid state . It had not settled down into calm water again full two hours after he had been seen fuming away on the horizon at the top of the steps . There were several small assemblages of the Bleeding Hearts at the popular points of meeting in the Yard that night , among whom it was universally agreed that Mr Pancks was a hard man to have to do with ; and that it was much to be regretted , so it was , that a gentleman like Mr Casby should put his rents in his hands , and never know him in his true light . For ( said the Bleeding Hearts ) , if a gentleman with that head of hair and them eyes took his rents into his own hands , ma’am , there would be none of this worriting and wearing , and things would be very different . At which identical evening hour and minute , the Patriarch -- who had floated serenely through the Yard in the forenoon before the harrying began , with the express design of getting up this trustfulness in his shining bumps and silken locks -- at which identical hour and minute , that first - rate humbug of a thousand guns was heavily floundering in the little Dock of his exhausted Tug at home , and was saying , as he turned his thumbs : ‘
140653	140743	140747	140751	a lady at our place	4125	’ CHAPTER 24 . Fortune - Telling Little Dorrit received a call that same evening from Mr Plornish , who , having intimated that he wished to speak to her privately , in a series of coughs so very noticeable as to favour the idea that her father , as regarded her seamstress occupation , was an illustration of the axiom that there are no such stone - blind men as those who will not see , obtained an audience with her on the common staircase outside the door . ‘
140759	140763	140769	140769	her	4125	’ Plornish growled , ‘
140795	140815	140784	140784	she	4125	’ The mild Plornish was at first quite unable to get his mind away from Mr F. ’s Aunt . ‘
140818	140826	140827	140827	she	4125	’ said he , to excuse himself , ‘
140839	140858	140827	140827	she	4125	’ At length , by a great effort , he detached himself from the subject sufficiently to observe : ‘
140917	140935	140913	140913	he	395	’ Mr Plornish , after his usual manner , was a little obscure , but conscientiously emphatic . ‘
140945	140949	140938	140938	she	4125	’ he pursued , ‘
141088	141089	141090	141090	I	0	’ ‘
141100	141105	141090	141090	I	0	’ said Little Dorrit . ‘
141119	141362	141114	141114	you	349	’ Mr Plornish , with a modest disavowal of his merits , opened the room door for her readmission , and followed her in with such an exceedingly bald pretence of not having been out at all , that her father might have observed it without being very suspicious . In his affable unconsciousness , however , he took no heed . Plornish , after a little conversation , in which he blended his former duty as a Collegian with his present privilege as a humble outside friend , qualified again by his low estate as a plasterer , took his leave ; making the tour of the prison before he left , and looking on at a game of skittles with the mixed feelings of an old inhabitant who had his private reasons for believing that it might be his destiny to come back again . Early in the morning , Little Dorrit , leaving Maggy in high domestic trust , set off for the Patriarchal tent . She went by the Iron Bridge , though it cost her a penny , and walked more slowly in that part of her journey than in any other . At five minutes before eight her hand was on the Patriarchal knocker , which was quite as high as she could reach . She gave Mrs Finching ’s card to the young woman who opened the door , and the young woman told her that ‘
141637	141651	141634	141634	she	499	‘ Why , what a good little thing you are , my dear ! ’
141709	141859	141861	141861	Flora	499	‘ Really so sorry that I should happen to be late on this morning of all mornings because my intention and my wish was to be ready to meet you when you came in and to say that any one that interested Arthur Clennam half so much must interest me and that I gave you the heartiest welcome and was so glad , instead of which they never called me and there I still am snoring I dare say if the truth was known and if you do n’t like either cold fowl or hot boiled ham which many people do n’t I dare say besides Jews and theirs are scruples of conscience which we must all respect though I must say I wish they had them equally strong when they sell us false articles for real that certainly ai n’t worth the money I shall be quite vexed , ’
141884	141897	141899	141899	Flora	499	‘ Oh nonsense my dear child I can never hear of that , ’

145121	145182	145118	145119	Miss Dorrit	349	’ Her eyes met his as she looked up wonderingly into his face , and she thought that although his were sharp eyes , he was a brighter and gentler - looking man than she had supposed at dinner . His eyes were on her hand again directly , and her opportunity of confirming or correcting the impression was gone . ‘
145191	145207	145185	145186	the deuce	4183	’ muttered Pancks , tracing out a line in her hand with his clumsy finger , ‘
145229	145261	145185	145186	the deuce	4183	’ He carried his finger slowly down to the wrist , and round the wrist , and affected to look at the back of the hand for what was behind him . ‘
145267	145274	145275	145275	Deuce	502	’ asked Little Dorrit , smiling . ‘
145279	145283	145275	145275	Deuce	502	’ said Pancks . ‘
145292	145293	145286	145286	you	0	’ ‘
145309	145310	145301	145301	I	0	’ ‘
145313	145317	145301	145301	I	0	’ said Pancks . ‘
145332	145366	145329	145330	Miss Dorrit	349	’ Releasing the hand by slow degrees , he drew all his fingers through his prongs of hair , so that they stood up in their most portentous manner ; and repeated slowly , ‘
145381	145405	145375	145375	You	349	’ She could not help showing that she was much surprised , if it were only by his knowing so much about her . ‘
145412	145420	145421	145422	Miss Dorrit	349	’ said Pancks , pointing at her . ‘
145429	145453	145421	145422	Miss Dorrit	349	’ More surprised than before , and a little more frightened , she looked to him for an explanation of his last words . ‘
145457	145482	145421	145422	Miss Dorrit	349	’ said Pancks , making , with great seriousness , an imitation of a surprised look and manner that appeared to be unintentionally grotesque . ‘
145529	145530	145523	145523	you	349	’ ‘
145538	145546	145523	145523	you	349	’ returned Little Dorrit , quite astounded . ‘
145549	145550	145523	145523	you	349	’ ‘
145608	145609	145605	145606	Miss Dorrit	349	’ ‘
145617	145618	145605	145606	Miss Dorrit	349	’ ‘
145718	145719	145720	145720	Ye	349	’ ‘
145724	145734	145720	145720	Ye	349	’ faltered Little Dorrit , whom he greatly confused , ‘
145745	145746	145740	145740	you	349	’ ‘
145749	145765	145766	145767	Honest creature	4192	’ Mr Pancks glanced at the wall of the adjoining room , and stooped forward . ‘
145784	146253	145781	145782	Miss Dorrit	349	’ With that he rubbed his hands as if the interview had been very satisfactory to him , panted away to the door , and urbanely nodded himself out again . If Little Dorrit were beyond measure perplexed by this curious conduct on the part of her new acquaintance , and by finding herself involved in this singular treaty , her perplexity was not diminished by ensuing circumstances . Besides that Mr Pancks took every opportunity afforded him in Mr Casby ’s house of significantly glancing at her and snorting at her -- which was not much , after what he had done already -- he began to pervade her daily life . She saw him in the street , constantly . When she went to Mr Casby ’s , he was always there . When she went to Mrs Clennam ’s , he came there on any pretence , as if to keep her in his sight . A week had not gone by , when she found him to her astonishment in the Lodge one night , conversing with the turnkey on duty , and to all appearance one of his familiar companions . Her next surprise was to find him equally at his ease within the prison ; to hear of his presenting himself among the visitors at her father ’s Sunday levee ; to see him arm in arm with a Collegiate friend about the yard ; to learn , from Fame , that he had greatly distinguished himself one evening at the social club that held its meetings in the Snuggery , by addressing a speech to the members of the institution , singing a song , and treating the company to five gallons of ale -- report madly added a bushel of shrimps . The effect on Mr Plornish of such of these phenomena as he became an eye - witness of in his faithful visits , made an impression on Little Dorrit only second to that produced by the phenomena themselves . They seemed to gag and bind him . He could only stare , and sometimes weakly mutter that it would n’t be believed down Bleeding Heart Yard that this was Pancks ; but he never said a word more , or made a sign more , even to Little Dorrit . Mr Pancks crowned his mysteries by making himself acquainted with Tip in some unknown manner , and taking a Sunday saunter into the College on that gentleman ’s arm . Throughout he never took any notice of Little Dorrit , save once or twice when he happened to come close to her and there was no one very near ; on which occasions , he said in passing , with a friendly look and a puff of encouragement , ‘
146262	146691	146254	146254	Pancks	396	’ Little Dorrit worked and strove as usual , wondering at all this , but keeping her wonder , as she had from her earliest years kept many heavier loads , in her own breast . A change had stolen , and was stealing yet , over the patient heart . Every day found her something more retiring than the day before . To pass in and out of the prison unnoticed , and elsewhere to be overlooked and forgotten , were , for herself , her chief desires . To her own room too , strangely assorted room for her delicate youth and character , she was glad to retreat as often as she could without desertion of any duty . There were afternoon times when she was unemployed , when visitors dropped in to play a hand at cards with her father , when she could be spared and was better away . Then she would flit along the yard , climb the scores of stairs that led to her room , and take her seat at the window . Many combinations did those spikes upon the wall assume , many light shapes did the strong iron weave itself into , many golden touches fell upon the rust , while Little Dorrit sat there musing . New zig - zags sprung into the cruel pattern sometimes , when she saw it through a burst of tears ; but beautified or hardened still , always over it and under it and through it , she was fain to look in her solitude , seeing everything with that ineffaceable brand . A garret , and a Marshalsea garret without compromise , was Little Dorrit ’s room . Beautifully kept , it was ugly in itself , and had little but cleanliness and air to set it off ; for what embellishment she had ever been able to buy , had gone to her father ’s room . Howbeit , for this poor place she showed an increasing love ; and to sit in it alone became her favourite rest . Insomuch , that on a certain afternoon during the Pancks mysteries , when she was seated at her window , and heard Maggy ’s well - known step coming up the stairs , she was very much disturbed by the apprehension of being summoned away . As Maggy ’s step came higher up and nearer , she trembled and faltered ; and it was as much as she could do to speak , when Maggy at length appeared . ‘
146697	146705	146694	146695	Little Mother	294	’ said Maggy , panting for breath , ‘
146718	146719	146714	146714	He	4195	’ ‘
146724	146725	146722	146722	Maggy	358	’ ‘

146765	146818	146833	146835	the staring Maggy	358	‘ I am not very well , Maggy . I had better not go . I am going to lie down . See ! I lie down now , to ease my head . Say , with my grateful regard , that you left me so , or I would have come . ’
146819	146831	146833	146835	the staring Maggy	358	‘ Well , it an’t very polite though , Little Mother , ’
146837	146846	146833	146835	the staring Maggy	358	‘ to turn your face away , neither ! ’
146862	146872	146873	146873	she	4196	‘ Putting both your hands afore your face too ! ’
146877	146926	146873	146873	she	4196	‘ If you ca n’t bear the looks of a poor thing , it would be better to tell her so at once , and not go and shut her out like that , hurting her feelings and breaking her heart at ten year old , poor thing ! ’
146927	146937	146833	146835	the staring Maggy	358	‘ It ’s to ease my head , Maggy . ’
146938	146969	146873	146873	she	4196	‘ Well , and if you cry to ease your head , Little Mother , let me cry too . Do n’t go and have all the crying to yourself , ’
146973	146980	146873	146873	she	4196	‘ that an’t not being greedy . ’
147093	147104	147105	147105	she	4196	‘ He was very sorry , I can tell you , ’
147108	147142	147105	147105	she	4196	‘ and wanted to send a doctor . And he ’s coming again to - morrow he is and I do n’t think he ’ll have a good sleep to - night along o ’

Over against this chair , Maggy , with apoplectic exertions that were not at all required , dragged the box which was her seat on story - telling occasions , sat down upon it , hugged her own knees , and said , with a voracious appetite for stories , and with widely - opened eyes : ‘
147345	147348	147337	147338	Little Mother	294	‘ un ! ’
147349	147358	147494	147494	Chicking	504	‘ What shall it be about , Maggy ? ’

147372	147388	147370	147370	Maggy	358	‘ and let her be a reg’lar one . Beyond all belief , you know ! ’
147415	147465	147403	147403	her	274	‘ Maggy , there was once upon a time a fine King , and he had everything he could wish for , and a great deal more . He had gold and silver , diamonds and rubies , riches of every kind . He had palaces , and he had-- ’

148136	148153	148129	148130	Some one	1350	’ interposed Maggy . Little Dorrit timidly said Yes , she believed so ; and resumed : ‘
148221	148222	148194	148196	The tiny woman	4217	’ ‘
148229	148233	148194	148196	The tiny woman	4217	’ said Maggy . ‘

148422	148557	148562	148562	Maggy	358	‘ The Princess , after crying a very little for the loss of the tiny woman , dried her eyes and got out of her carriage at the place where she had stopped it before , and went to the cottage and peeped in at the door . There was nobody to look at her now , and nobody for her to look at , so she went in at once to search for the treasured shadow . But there was no sign of it to be found anywhere ; and then she knew that the tiny woman had told her the truth , and that it would never give anybody any trouble , and that it had sunk quietly into her own grave , and that she and it were at rest together . ‘
148564	148596	148562	148562	Maggy	358	’ The sunset flush was so bright on Little Dorrit ’s face when she came thus to the end of her story , that she interposed her hand to shade it . ‘
148604	148608	148609	148611	The tiny woman	4217	’ Maggy asked . ‘
148613	148614	148609	148611	The tiny woman	4217	’ ‘

148665	148729	148639	148639	she	4271	’ And sat staring and ruminating . She sat so long with her eyes wide open , that at length Little Dorrit , to entice her from her box , rose and looked out of window . As she glanced down into the yard , she saw Pancks come in and leer up with the corner of his eye as he went by . ‘
148737	148755	148732	148732	he	4273	’ said Maggy . She had joined her at the window and was leaning on her shoulder . ‘

148777	148782	148770	148770	him	4273	’ said Little Dorrit . ‘

148868	149439	148787	148787	he	4273	’ CHAPTER 25 . Conspirators and Others The private residence of Mr Pancks was in Pentonville , where he lodged on the second - floor of a professional gentleman in an extremely small way , who had an inner - door within the street door , poised on a spring and starting open with a click like a trap ; and who wrote up in the fan - light , RUGG , GENERAL AGENT , ACCOUNTANT , DEBTS RECOVERED . This scroll , majestic in its severe simplicity , illuminated a little slip of front garden abutting on the thirsty high - road , where a few of the dustiest of leaves hung their dismal heads and led a life of choking . A professor of writing occupied the first - floor , and enlivened the garden railings with glass - cases containing choice examples of what his pupils had been before six lessons and while the whole of his young family shook the table , and what they had become after six lessons when the young family was under restraint . The tenancy of Mr Pancks was limited to one airy bedroom ; he covenanting and agreeing with Mr Rugg his landlord , that in consideration of a certain scale of payments accurately defined , and on certain verbal notice duly given , he should be at liberty to elect to share the Sunday breakfast , dinner , tea , or supper , or each or any or all of those repasts or meals of Mr and Miss Rugg ( his daughter ) in the back - parlour . Miss Rugg was a lady of a little property which she had acquired , together with much distinction in the neighbourhood , by having her heart severely lacerated and her feelings mangled by a middle - aged baker resident in the vicinity , against whom she had , by the agency of Mr Rugg , found it necessary to proceed at law to recover damages for a breach of promise of marriage . The baker having been , by the counsel for Miss Rugg , witheringly denounced on that occasion up to the full amount of twenty guineas , at the rate of about eighteen - pence an epithet , and having been cast in corresponding damages , still suffered occasional persecution from the youth of Pentonville . But Miss Rugg , environed by the majesty of the law , and having her damages invested in the public securities , was regarded with consideration . In the society of Mr Rugg , who had a round white visage , as if all his blushes had been drawn out of him long ago , and who had a ragged yellow head like a worn - out hearth broom ; and in the society of Miss Rugg , who had little nankeen spots , like shirt buttons , all over her face , and whose own yellow tresses were rather scrubby than luxuriant ; Mr Pancks had usually dined on Sundays for some few years , and had twice a week , or so , enjoyed an evening collation of bread , Dutch cheese , and porter . Mr Pancks was one of the very few marriageable men for whom Miss Rugg had no terrors , the argument with which he reassured himself being twofold ; that is to say , firstly , ‘
149447	149451	148787	148787	he	4273	’ and secondly , ‘
149459	149854	149453	149453	he	4279	’ Fortified within this double armour , Mr Pancks snorted at Miss Rugg on easy terms . Up to this time , Mr Pancks had transacted little or no business at his quarters in Pentonville , except in the sleeping line ; but now that he had become a fortune - teller , he was often closeted after midnight with Mr Rugg in his little front - parlour office , and even after those untimely hours , burnt tallow in his bed - room . Though his duties as his proprietor ’s grubber were in no wise lessened ; and though that service bore no greater resemblance to a bed of roses than was to be discovered in its many thorns ; some new branch of industry made a constant demand upon him . When he cast off the Patriarch at night , it was only to take an anonymous craft in tow , and labour away afresh in other waters . The advance from a personal acquaintance with the elder Mr Chivery to an introduction to his amiable wife and disconsolate son , may have been easy ; but easy or not , Mr Pancks soon made it . He nestled in the bosom of the tobacco business within a week or two after his first appearance in the College , and particularly addressed himself to the cultivation of a good understanding with Young John . In this endeavour he so prospered as to lure that pining shepherd forth from the groves , and tempt him to undertake mysterious missions ; on which he began to disappear at uncertain intervals for as long a space as two or three days together . The prudent Mrs Chivery , who wondered greatly at this change , would have protested against it as detrimental to the Highland typification on the doorpost but for two forcible reasons ; one , that her John was roused to take strong interest in the business which these starts were supposed to advance -- and this she held to be good for his drooping spirits ; the other , that Mr Pancks confidentially agreed to pay her , for the occupation of her son ’s time , at the handsome rate of seven and sixpence per day . The proposal originated with himself , and was couched in the pithy terms , ‘
149899	150373	150374	150374	I	0	’ What Mr Chivery thought of these things , or how much or how little he knew about them , was never gathered from himself . It has been already remarked that he was a man of few words ; and it may be here observed that he had imbibed a professional habit of locking everything up . He locked himself up as carefully as he locked up the Marshalsea debtors . Even his custom of bolting his meals may have been a part of an uniform whole ; but there is no question , that , as to all other purposes , he kept his mouth as he kept the Marshalsea door . He never opened it without occasion . When it was necessary to let anything out , he opened it a little way , held it open just as long as sufficed for the purpose , and locked it again . Even as he would be sparing of his trouble at the Marshalsea door , and would keep a visitor who wanted to go out , waiting for a few moments if he saw another visitor coming down the yard , so that one turn of the key should suffice for both , similarly he would often reserve a remark if he perceived another on its way to his lips , and would deliver himself of the two together . As to any key to his inner knowledge being to be found in his face , the Marshalsea key was as legible as an index to the individual characters and histories upon which it was turned . That Mr Pancks should be moved to invite any one to dinner at Pentonville , was an unprecedented fact in his calendar . But he invited Young John to dinner , and even brought him within range of the dangerous ( because expensive ) fascinations of Miss Rugg . The banquet was appointed for a Sunday , and Miss Rugg with her own hands stuffed a leg of mutton with oysters on the occasion , and sent it to the baker’s -- not _ the _ baker ’s but an opposition establishment . Provision of oranges , apples , and nuts was also made . And rum was brought home by Mr Pancks on Saturday night , to gladden the visitor ’s heart . The store of creature comforts was not the chief part of the visitor ’s reception . Its special feature was a foregone family confidence and sympathy . When Young John appeared at half - past one without the ivory hand and waistcoat of golden sprigs , the sun shorn of his beams by disastrous clouds , Mr Pancks presented him to the yellow - haired Ruggs as the young man he had so often mentioned who loved Miss Dorrit . ‘
150378	150390	150374	150374	I	0	’ said Mr Rugg , challenging him specially in that character , ‘
150431	150454	150421	150421	I	0	’ said Mr Rugg , who was a man of many words , and was considered to possess a remarkably good address ; ‘
150483	150490	150491	150491	My	0	’ Miss Rugg heaved a sigh . ‘
150496	150501	150494	150494	sir	933	’ said Mr Rugg . ‘
150544	150564	150538	150538	she	1840	’ Young John , almost overwhelmed by the touching nature of this greeting , professed himself to that effect . ‘
150574	150579	150566	150566	I	0	’ said Mr Rugg , ‘
150637	150723	150724	150724	Sir	933	’ Young John replied , with acknowledgments , that he only hoped he did what was right , and what showed how entirely he was devoted to Miss Dorrit . He wished to be unselfish ; and he hoped he was . He wished to do anything as laid in his power to serve Miss Dorrit , altogether putting himself out of sight ; and he hoped he did . It was but little that he could do , but he hoped he did it . ‘
150726	150737	150724	150724	Sir	933	’ said Mr Rugg , taking him by the hand , ‘
150798	150799	150801	150801	you	0	’ ‘
150805	150810	150803	150803	sir	933	’ returned Young John , ‘
150819	150828	150829	150829	My	0	’ Mr Rugg drew him a little apart . ‘
150836	150840	150829	150829	My	0	’ said he , ‘
150907	150908	150909	150909	I	0	’ ‘
150920	150936	150911	150911	I	0	’ returned the other , hesitating , as if he confessed it with some shame . ‘
150949	150962	150965	150966	Mr Chivery	452	’ said Mr Rugg , with argumentative smile and action of hand . ‘
150974	150975	150968	150972	No fiend in human form	4307	’ ‘
150982	150989	150978	150978	sir	933	’ Young John added with simplicity , ‘
150999	151000	150978	150978	sir	933	’ ‘
151004	151009	150978	150978	sir	933	’ said Mr Rugg , ‘
151087	151338	151065	151066	Mr Chivery	452	’ But for a grave waggishness in Mr Rugg ’s manner of delivering this introduction to the feast , it might have appeared that Miss Dorrit was expected to be one of the company . Pancks recognised the sally in his usual way , and took in his provender in his usual way . Miss Rugg , perhaps making up some of her arrears , likewise took very kindly to the mutton , and it rapidly diminished to the bone . A bread - and - butter pudding entirely disappeared , and a considerable amount of cheese and radishes vanished by the same means . Then came the dessert . Then also , and before the broaching of the rum and water , came Mr Pancks ’s note - book . The ensuing business proceedings were brief but curious , and rather in the nature of a conspiracy . Mr Pancks looked over his note - book , which was now getting full , studiously ; and picked out little extracts , which he wrote on separate slips of paper on the table ; Mr Rugg , in the meanwhile , looking at him with close attention , and Young John losing his uncollected eye in mists of meditation . When Mr Pancks , who supported the character of chief conspirator , had completed his extracts , he looked them over , corrected them , put up his note - book , and held them like a hand at cards . ‘
151348	151352	151065	151066	Mr Chivery	452	’ said Pancks . ‘
151357	151358	151359	151359	I	0	’ ‘
151366	151371	151359	151359	I	0	’ returned Mr Rugg , ‘
151377	151392	151359	151359	I	0	’ Mr Pancks dealt him his card , and looked at his hand again . ‘
151402	151406	151448	151448	Pancks	396	’ said Pancks . ‘
151411	151412	151413	151413	I	0	’ ‘

151433	151443	151444	151445	Young John	449	‘ you ’ll be so obliging , John Chivery ? ’
151460	151499	151501	151501	Pancks	396	‘ There ’s a Church in London ; I may as well take that . And a Family Bible ; I may as well take that , too . That ’s two to me . Two to me , ’
151509	151576	151501	151501	Pancks	396	‘ Here ’s a Clerk at Durham for you , John , and an old seafaring gentleman at Dunstable for you , Mr Rugg . Two to me , was it ? Yes , two to me . Here ’s a Stone ; three to me . And a Still - born Baby ; four to me . And all , for the present , told . ’
151635	151641	151642	151642	he	396	‘ Cash goes out fast , ’
151658	151662	151642	151642	he	396	‘ very fast . ’
151663	151673	151675	151676	Young John	449	‘ I can only assure you , Mr Pancks , ’
151678	151737	151675	151676	Young John	449	‘ that I deeply regret my circumstances being such that I ca n’t afford to pay my own charges , or that it ’s not advisable to allow me the time necessary for my doing the distances on foot ; because nothing would give me greater satisfaction than to walk myself off my legs without fee or reward . ’

153229	153247	153224	153224	E	396	’ The little man smiled and nodded . His bright face seemed uncommonly attractive to Mr Pancks . ‘
153257	153263	153250	153250	he	4354	’ he asked Mrs Plornish . ‘
153274	153279	153266	153266	he	4354	’ said Mrs Plornish . ‘
153295	153321	153266	153266	he	4354	’ ( The opportunity being too favourable to be lost , Mrs Plornish displayed her great accomplishment by explaining with pardonable pride to Mr Baptist , ‘
153329	153331	153266	153266	he	4354	’ ) ‘
153340	153355	153332	153332	He	4354	’ said Mr Pancks , admiring him as if he were a mechanical toy . ‘

153367	153372	153373	153373	he	4354	’ rejoined Mrs Plornish , ‘
153392	153423	153424	153424	E	933	’ ( Mr Baptist , watching their faces as they spoke , held up his work . Mrs Plornish interpreted in her Italian manner , on behalf of Mr Pancks , ‘
153430	153432	153424	153424	E	933	’ ) ‘
153439	153444	153424	153424	E	933	’ asked Mr Pancks . ‘

153618	153623	153624	153624	He	4354	’ echoed Mr Pancks . ‘

153658	153663	153664	153664	he	4354	’ said Mrs Plornish , ‘
153718	153785	153788	153788	Altro	283	’ Mr Baptist seemed to have a general understanding of what she said ; or perhaps his quickness caught and applied her slight action of peeping . In any case he closed his eyes and tossed his head with the air of a man who had sufficient reasons for what he did , and said in his own tongue , it did n’t matter . Altro ! ‘
153790	153794	153788	153788	Altro	283	’ said Pancks . ‘
153810	153815	153808	153808	sir	933	’ said Mrs Plornish . ‘

153839	153918	153837	153837	Altro	283	’ Mr Baptist in his vivacious way repeating the word several times , Mr Pancks in his duller way gave it him back once . From that time it became a frequent custom with Pancks the gipsy , as he went home jaded at night , to pass round by Bleeding Heart Yard , go quietly up the stairs , look in at Mr Baptist ’s door , and , finding him in his room , to say , ‘
153926	153940	153941	153941	Altro	283	’ To which Mr Baptist would reply with innumerable bright nods and smiles , ‘
153951	154280	153941	153941	Altro	283	’ After this highly condensed conversation , Mr Pancks would go his way with an appearance of being lightened and refreshed . CHAPTER 26 . Nobody ’s State of Mind If Arthur Clennam had not arrived at that wise decision firmly to restrain himself from loving Pet , he would have lived on in a state of much perplexity , involving difficult struggles with his own heart . Not the least of these would have been a contention , always waging within it , between a tendency to dislike Mr Henry Gowan , if not to regard him with positive repugnance , and a whisper that the inclination was unworthy . A generous nature is not prone to strong aversions , and is slow to admit them even dispassionately ; but when it finds ill - will gaining upon it , and can discern between - whiles that its origin is not dispassionate , such a nature becomes distressed . Therefore Mr Henry Gowan would have clouded Clennam ’s mind , and would have been far oftener present to it than more agreeable persons and subjects but for the great prudence of his decision aforesaid . As it was , Mr Gowan seemed transferred to Daniel Doyce ’s mind ; at all events , it so happened that it usually fell to Mr Doyce ’s turn , rather than to Clennam ’s , to speak of him in the friendly conversations they held together . These were of frequent occurrence now ; as the two partners shared a portion of a roomy house in one of the grave old - fashioned City streets , lying not far from the Bank of England , by London Wall . Mr Doyce had been to Twickenham to pass the day . Clennam had excused himself . Mr Doyce was just come home . He put in his head at the door of Clennam ’s sitting - room to say Good night . ‘
154287	154291	154292	154292	I	0	’ said Clennam . ‘
154298	154306	154309	154309	you	0	’ returned Doyce , as he entered , ‘
154317	154369	154292	154292	I	0	’ But for the notable resolution he had made , Clennam really might not have known what he had been reading ; really might not have had his eyes upon the book for an hour past , though it lay open before him . He shut it up , rather quickly . ‘
154374	154378	154292	154292	I	0	’ he asked . ‘
154381	154385	154292	154292	I	0	’ said Doyce ; ‘
154395	154426	154390	154390	They	4384	’ Daniel had an old workmanlike habit of carrying his pocket - handkerchief in his hat . He took it out and wiped his forehead with it , slowly repeating , ‘
154441	154442	154438	154438	I	0	’ ‘

154468	154473	154465	154465	you	4388	’ asked Clennam gaily . ‘
154480	154485	154476	154478	five of us	4389	’ returned his partner . ‘
154498	154499	154494	154494	He	4391	’ ‘
154504	154508	154502	154502	he	4391	’ said Clennam . ‘

154521	154528	154509	154511	Mr Henry Gowan	272	’ cried Clennam with unusual vivacity , ‘
154533	154534	154529	154529	Yes!--I	515	’ ‘
154543	154548	154549	154549	he	4391	’ said Daniel Doyce , ‘
154556	154557	154549	154549	he	4391	’ ‘
154562	154566	154549	154549	he	4391	’ returned Clennam ; ‘
154571	154583	154567	154567	I	0	’ Daniel Doyce , still wiping his forehead , ploddingly repeated . ‘
154612	154613	154606	154606	He	4391	’ ‘
154625	154629	154614	154615	Miss Meagles	516	’ observed Clennam . ‘
154633	154638	154614	154615	Miss Meagles	516	’ assented his partner . ‘

154667	154689	154661	154662	Mr Gowan	272	’ said Daniel Doyce . There was a gap in the conversation , which Clennam devoted to winding up his watch . ‘
154700	154704	154691	154691	you	0	’ he said . ‘
154714	154715	154708	154708	I	0	’ ‘

154764	154780	154762	154762	Gowan	272	’ quietly said Doyce , upon whom the utterance of the name almost always devolved . ‘

154832	154837	154840	154840	him	272	’ returned his partner . ‘

154921	154935	154916	154916	We	4402	’ said Clennam , almost in the tone of a man in pain , ‘
154944	154945	154946	154946	We	4402	’ ‘
154951	154956	154946	154946	We	4402	’ returned his partner , ‘

154979	154983	154946	154946	We	4402	’ said Clennam , ‘

155068	155072	155045	155045	her	859	’ said Doyce . ‘

155097	155101	155045	155045	her	859	’ said Clennam , ‘
155111	155122	155123	155123	I	0	’ Daniel Doyce shook his head gravely , and rejoined , ‘
155127	155128	155123	155123	I	0	’ ‘
155135	155139	155123	155123	I	0	’ said Clennam , ‘
155187	155188	155175	155175	I	0	’ ‘
155209	155214	155200	155200	I	0	’ returned the other . ‘
155260	155728	155258	155258	partner	11305	’ He shook his hand in saying this , as if there had been something serious at the bottom of their conversation ; and they separated . By this time they had visited the family on several occasions , and had always observed that even a passing allusion to Mr Henry Gowan when he was not among them , brought back the cloud which had obscured Mr Meagles ’s sunshine on the morning of the chance encounter at the Ferry . If Clennam had ever admitted the forbidden passion into his breast , this period might have been a period of real trial ; under the actual circumstances , doubtless it was nothing -- nothing . Equally , if his heart had given entertainment to that prohibited guest , his silent fighting of his way through the mental condition of this period might have been a little meritorious . In the constant effort not to be betrayed into a new phase of the besetting sin of his experience , the pursuit of selfish objects by low and small means , and to hold instead to some high principle of honour and generosity , there might have been a little merit . In the resolution not even to avoid Mr Meagles ’s house , lest , in the selfish sparing of himself , he should bring any slight distress upon the daughter through making her the cause of an estrangement which he believed the father would regret , there might have been a little merit . In the modest truthfulness of always keeping in view the greater equality of Mr Gowan ’s years and the greater attractions of his person and manner , there might have been a little merit . In doing all this and much more , in a perfectly unaffected way and with a manful and composed constancy , while the pain within him ( peculiar as his life and history ) was very sharp , there might have been some quiet strength of character . But , after the resolution he had made , of course he could have no such merits as these ; and such a state of mind was nobody’s -- nobody ’s . Mr Gowan made it no concern of his whether it was nobody ’s or somebody ’s . He preserved his perfect serenity of manner on all occasions , as if the possibility of Clennam ’s presuming to have debated the great question were too distant and ridiculous to be imagined . He had always an affability to bestow on Clennam and an ease to treat him with , which might of itself ( in the supposititious case of his not having taken that sagacious course ) have been a very uncomfortable element in his state of mind . ‘
155739	155752	155732	155732	you	0	’ said Mr Henry Gowan , calling on Clennam the next morning . ‘
155763	155772	155753	155753	We	4409	’ So he had heard , Arthur said . ‘
155777	155782	155753	155753	We	4409	’ returned Henry Gowan . ‘
155791	155792	155753	155753	We	4409	’ ‘

155812	155816	155806	155806	he	4411	’ said Gowan . ‘
155829	155867	155868	155868	He	4411	’ Here was one of the many little rough points that had a tendency to grate on Clennam ’s hearing . He put it aside by merely repeating that he had a high regard for Mr Doyce . ‘
155954	155955	155949	155949	You	304	’ ‘
155962	155970	155949	155949	You	304	’ said Clennam , ill at ease ; ‘
155978	155979	155971	155971	you	304	’ ‘
155983	155988	155971	155971	you	304	’ rejoined the other . ‘

156169	156173	156164	156164	I	0	’ said Clennam , ‘

156190	156196	156187	156188	the Barnacles	272	’ interrupted Gowan , laughing . ‘
156209	156210	156187	156188	the Barnacles	272	’ ‘
156221	156228	156229	156229	they	4427	’ said Gowan , laughing afresh , ‘

156280	156286	156257	156257	Jupiter	519	’ said Clennam , drily . ‘
156291	156314	156257	156257	Jupiter	519	’ cried Gowan , with that characteristic balancing of his which reduced everything in the wide world to the same light weight , ‘
156350	156351	156348	156348	gentlemen	9694	’ ‘
156378	156386	156374	156374	I	0	’ said Clennam , shaking his head . ‘
156395	156401	156389	156389	You	304	’ returned Gowan , airily . ‘
156470	156499	156500	156500	My	0	’ In nobody ’s state of mind , there was nothing Clennam would have desired less , or would have been more at a loss how to avoid . ‘
156520	156524	156500	156501	My mother	9736	’ said Gowan . ‘
156566	157078	157083	157083	his	4450	’ What could Clennam say after this ? His retiring character included a great deal that was simple in the best sense , because unpractised and unused ; and in his simplicity and modesty , he could only say that he was happy to place himself at Mr Gowan ’s disposal . Accordingly he said it , and the day was fixed . And a dreaded day it was on his part , and a very unwelcome day when it came and they went down to Hampton Court together . The venerable inhabitants of that venerable pile seemed , in those times , to be encamped there like a sort of civilised gipsies . There was a temporary air about their establishments , as if they were going away the moment they could get anything better ; there was also a dissatisfied air about themselves , as if they took it very ill that they had not already got something much better . Genteel blinds and makeshifts were more or less observable as soon as their doors were opened ; screens not half high enough , which made dining - rooms out of arched passages , and warded off obscure corners where footboys slept at nights with their heads among the knives and forks ; curtains which called upon you to believe that they did n’t hide anything ; panes of glass which requested you not to see them ; many objects of various forms , feigning to have no connection with their guilty secret , a bed ; disguised traps in walls , which were clearly coal - cellars ; affectations of no thoroughfares , which were evidently doors to little kitchens . Mental reservations and artful mysteries grew out of these things . Callers looking steadily into the eyes of their receivers , pretended not to smell cooking three feet off ; people , confronting closets accidentally left open , pretended not to see bottles ; visitors with their heads against a partition of thin canvas , and a page and a young female at high words on the other side , made believe to be sitting in a primeval silence . There was no end to the small social accommodation - bills of this nature which the gipsies of gentility were constantly drawing upon , and accepting for , one another . Some of these Bohemians were of an irritable temperament , as constantly soured and vexed by two mental trials : the first , the consciousness that they had never got enough out of the public ; the second , the consciousness that the public were admitted into the building . Under the latter great wrong , a few suffered dreadfully -- particularly on Sundays , when they had for some time expected the earth to open and swallow the public up ; but which desirable event had not yet occurred , in consequence of some reprehensible laxity in the arrangements of the Universe . Mrs Gowan ’s door was attended by a family servant of several years ’
157707	157712	157714	157715	Mrs Gowan	576	‘ If John Barnacle , ’
157728	157760	157714	157715	Mrs Gowan	576	‘ if John Barnacle had but abandoned his most unfortunate idea of conciliating the mob , all would have been well , and I think the country would have been preserved . ’
158321	158325	158327	158328	Mrs Gowan	576	‘ Mr Clennam , ’
158330	158391	158327	158328	Mrs Gowan	576	‘ apart from the happiness I have in becoming known to you , though in this odiously inconvenient place -- a mere barrack -- there is a subject on which I am dying to speak to you . It is the subject in connection with which my son first had , I believe , the pleasure of cultivating your acquaintance . ’
158411	158414	158416	158417	Mrs Gowan	576	‘ First , ’
158419	158427	158416	158417	Mrs Gowan	576	‘ now , is she really pretty ? ’
158451	158454	158433	158433	he	304	‘ Who ? ’
158455	158461	158462	158462	she	4519	‘ Oh ! You know ! ’
158465	158497	158433	158433	he	304	‘ This flame of Henry ’s . This unfortunate fancy . There ! If it is a point of honour that I should originate the name -- Miss Mickles -- Miggles . ’
158498	158502	158504	158504	Clennam	304	‘ Miss Meagles , ’
158506	158511	158504	158504	Clennam	304	‘ is very beautiful . ’
158512	158522	158524	158525	Mrs Gowan	576	‘ Men are so often mistaken on those points , ’
158531	158575	158528	158528	her	4519	‘ that I candidly confess to you I feel anything but sure of it , even now ; though it is something to have Henry corroborated with so much gravity and emphasis . He picked the people up at Rome , I think ? ’
158588	158600	158585	158585	Clennam	304	‘ Excuse me , I doubt if I understand your expression . ’
158601	158607	158609	158610	Mrs Gowan	576	‘ Picked the people up , ’
158639	158652	158626	158626	she	4519	‘ Came upon them . Found them out . Stumbled against them . ’
158653	158657	158585	158585	Clennam	304	‘ The people ? ’
158658	158665	158626	158626	she	4519	‘ Yes . The Miggles people . ’
158666	158673	158675	158675	Clennam	304	‘ I really can not say , ’
158677	158692	158675	158675	Clennam	304	‘ where my friend Mr Meagles first presented Mr Henry Gowan to his daughter . ’
158693	158726	158626	158626	she	4519	‘ I am pretty sure he picked her up at Rome ; but never mind where -- somewhere . Now ( this is entirely between ourselves ) , is she very plebeian ? ’
158727	158732	158734	158734	Clennam	304	‘ Really , ma’am , ’
158736	158753	158734	158734	Clennam	304	‘ I am so undoubtedly plebeian myself , that I do not feel qualified to judge . ’
158754	158758	158760	158761	Mrs Gowan	576	‘ Very neat ! ’
158768	158787	158760	158761	Mrs Gowan	576	‘ Very happy ! From which I infer that you secretly think her manner equal to her looks ? ’
158798	158821	158788	158788	Clennam	304	‘ That ’s comforting , and I hope you may be right . Did Henry tell me you had travelled with them ? ’
158822	158841	158843	158843	Nobody	770	‘ I travelled with my friend Mr Meagles , and his wife and daughter , during some months . ’
158855	158931	158843	158843	Nobody	770	‘ Really comforting , because you must have had a large experience of them . You see , Mr Clennam , this thing has been going on for a long time , and I find no improvement in it . Therefore to have the opportunity of speaking to one so well informed about it as yourself , is an immense relief to me . Quite a boon . Quite a blessing , I am sure . ’
158932	158936	158938	158938	Clennam	304	‘ Pardon me , ’
158940	158992	158938	158938	Clennam	304	‘ but I am not in Mr Henry Gowan ’s confidence . I am far from being so well informed as you suppose me to be . Your mistake makes my position a very delicate one . No word on this topic has ever passed between Mr Henry Gowan and myself . ’
159026	159034	159036	159037	Mrs Gowan	576	‘ Not in his confidence ? No , ’
159039	159115	159117	159117	her	4524	‘ No word has passed between you ? No . That I can imagine . But there are unexpressed confidences , Mr Clennam ; and as you have been together intimately among these people , I can not doubt that a confidence of that sort exists in the present case . Perhaps you have heard that I have suffered the keenest distress of mind from Henry ’s having taken to a pursuit which -- well ! ’
159120	159166	159117	159117	her	4524	‘ a very respectable pursuit , I dare say , and some artists are , as artists , quite superior persons ; still , we never yet in our family have gone beyond an Amateur , and it is a pardonable weakness to feel a little-- ’
159212	159215	159216	159217	the mother	1250	‘ Henry , ’
159220	159334	159336	159336	she	1250	‘ is self - willed and resolute ; and as these people naturally strain every nerve to catch him , I can entertain very little hope , Mr Clennam , that the thing will be broken off . I apprehend the girl ’s fortune will be very small ; Henry might have done much better ; there is scarcely anything to compensate for the connection : still , he acts for himself ; and if I find no improvement within a short time , I see no other course than to resign myself and make the best of these people . I am infinitely obliged to you for what you have told me . ’
159374	159452	159360	159360	he	304	‘ Mrs Gowan , I scarcely know how to acquit myself of what I feel to be a duty , and yet I must ask you for your kind consideration in attempting to discharge it . A misconception on your part , a very great misconception if I may venture to call it so , seems to require setting right . You have supposed Mr Meagles and his family to strain every nerve , I think you said-- ’
159453	159457	159459	159460	Mrs Gowan	576	‘ Every nerve , ’
159480	159487	159488	159489	The lady	3830	‘ To secure Mr Henry Gowan ? ’
159493	159500	159502	159502	Arthur	304	‘ Now that is so far , ’
159504	159539	159502	159502	Arthur	304	‘ from being the case , that I know Mr Meagles to be unhappy in this matter ; and to have interposed all reasonable obstacles with the hope of putting an end to it . ’
159563	159569	159571	159571	she	4530	‘ Why , of course , ’
159573	159579	159571	159571	she	4530	‘ Just what I mean . ’
159593	159607	159580	159580	Arthur	304	‘ Are you really serious , Mr Clennam ? Do n’t you see ? ’
159617	159642	159644	159645	Mrs Gowan	576	‘ Why , do n’t I know my son , and do n’t I know that this is exactly the way to hold him ? ’
159649	159715	159644	159645	Mrs Gowan	576	‘ and do not these Miggles people know it , at least as well as I ? Oh , shrewd people , Mr Clennam : evidently people of business ! I believe Miggles belonged to a Bank . It ought to have been a very profitable Bank , if he had much to do with its management . This is very well done , indeed . ’
159716	159724	159725	159725	Arthur	304	‘ I beg and entreat you , ma’am-- ’
159728	159741	159725	159725	Arthur	304	‘ Oh , Mr Clennam , can you really be so credulous ? ’
159777	159792	159772	159772	he	304	‘ Believe me , ma’am , this is unjust , a perfectly groundless suspicion . ’

159801	159828	159829	159829	She	4532	‘ Not suspicion , Mr Clennam , Certainty . It is very knowingly done indeed , and seems to have taken _ you _ in completely . ’
159852	159873	159849	159849	she	4532	‘ Do n’t tell me . I know such people will do anything for the honour of such an alliance . ’
159895	159922	159886	159888	Mr Henry Gowan	272	‘ Mother , if you can spare Mr Clennam for this time , we have a long way to go , and it ’s getting late . ’
159957	159969	159971	159971	Gowan	576	‘ You have had a portentously long audience of my mother , ’
159980	159990	159971	159971	Gowan	576	‘ I fervently hope she has not bored you ? ’
159991	159996	159998	159998	Clennam	304	‘ Not at all , ’
160050	160062	160046	160046	Gowan	576	‘ I am very much afraid my mother has bored you ? ’
160071	160076	160046	160046	Gowan	576	‘ Not at all ! ’
160131	160148	160113	160113	he	576	‘ Does he jerk me out of the path in the same careless , cruel way ? ’
160343	160379	160333	160333	he	576	‘ Where are we driving , he and I , I wonder , on the darker road of life ? How will it be with us , and with her , in the obscure distance ? ’
160425	160433	160435	160435	Gowan	576	‘ You are evidently out of spirits , ’
160437	160451	160435	160435	Gowan	576	‘ I am very much afraid my mother must have bored you dreadfully . ’
160452	160460	160462	160462	Clennam	304	‘ Believe me , not at all , ’
160464	160471	160462	160462	Clennam	304	‘ It ’s nothing -- nothing ! ’
161172	161175	161162	161163	Mr Meagles	288	‘ Clennam!--Tattycoram ! ’
161176	161182	161157	161157	his	288	‘ What ’s the matter ? ’
161183	161186	161157	161157	his	288	‘ Lost ! ’
161187	161195	161197	161197	Clennam	304	‘ Why , bless my heart alive ! ’
161201	161207	161197	161197	Clennam	304	‘ What do you mean ? ’
161208	161237	161157	161157	his	288	‘ Would n’t count five - and - twenty , sir ; could n’t be got to do it ; stopped at eight , and took herself off . ’
161238	161243	161157	161157	his	288	‘ Left your house ? ’
161244	161250	161252	161253	Mr Meagles	288	‘ Never to come back , ’
161259	161296	161256	161256	his	288	‘ You do n’t know that girl ’s passionate and proud character . A team of horses could n’t draw her back now ; the bolts and bars of the old Bastille could n’t keep her . ’
161297	161310	161157	161157	his	288	‘ How did it happen ? Pray sit down and tell me . ’
161311	161422	161423	161423	Nobody	770	‘ As to how it happened , it ’s not so easy to relate : because you must have the unfortunate temperament of the poor impetuous girl herself , before you can fully understand it . But it came about in this way . Pet and Mother and I have been having a good deal of talk together of late . I ’ll not disguise from you , Clennam , that those conversations have not been of as bright a kind as I could wish ; they have referred to our going away again . In proposing to do which , I have had , in fact , an object . ’
161429	161433	161435	161436	Mr Meagles	288	‘ An object , ’
161444	161483	161435	161436	Mr Meagles	288	‘ that I will not disguise from you , either , Clennam . There ’s an inclination on the part of my dear child which I am sorry for . Perhaps you guess the person . Henry Gowan . ’
161484	161493	161157	161157	his	288	‘ I was not unprepared to hear it . ’
161494	161497	161499	161500	Mr Meagles	288	‘ Well ! ’
161507	161617	161499	161500	Mr Meagles	288	‘ I wish to God you had never had to hear it . However , so it is . Mother and I have done all we could to get the better of it , Clennam . We have tried tender advice , we have tried time , we have tried absence . As yet , of no use . Our late conversations have been upon the subject of going away for another year at least , in order that there might be an entire separation and breaking off for that term . Upon that question , Pet has been unhappy , and therefore Mother and I have been unhappy . ’
161627	161630	161632	161633	Mr Meagles	288	‘ Well ! ’
161639	161752	161632	161633	Mr Meagles	288	‘ I admit as a practical man , and I am sure Mother would admit as a practical woman , that we do , in families , magnify our troubles and make mountains of our molehills in a way that is calculated to be rather trying to people who look on -- to mere outsiders , you know , Clennam . Still , Pet ’s happiness or unhappiness is quite a life or death question with us ; and we may be excused , I hope , for making much of it . At all events , it might have been borne by Tattycoram . Now , do n’t you think so ? ’
161753	161760	161762	161762	Clennam	304	‘ I do indeed think so , ’
161774	161779	161781	161782	Mr Meagles	288	‘ No , sir , ’
161789	161875	161785	161785	his	288	‘ She could n’t stand it . The chafing and firing of that girl , the wearing and tearing of that girl within her own breast , has been such that I have softly said to her again and again in passing her , “ Five - and - twenty , Tattycoram , five - and - twenty ! ” I heartily wish she could have gone on counting five - and - twenty day and night , and then it would n’t have happened . ’
161919	162048	161915	161915	his	288	‘ I said to Mother ( not that it was necessary , for she would have thought it all for herself ) , we are practical people , my dear , and we know her story ; we see in this unhappy girl some reflection of what was raging in her mother ’s heart before ever such a creature as this poor thing was in the world ; we ’ll gloss her temper over , Mother , we wo n’t notice it at present , my dear , we ’ll take advantage of some better disposition in her another time . So we said nothing . But , do what we would , it seems as if it was to be ; she broke out violently one night . ’
162049	162055	162076	162076	he	288	‘ How , and why ? ’
162056	162063	162076	162076	he	288	‘ If you ask me Why , ’
162090	162196	162076	162076	he	288	‘ I can only refer you to what I have just repeated as having been pretty near my words to Mother . As to How , we had said Good night to Pet in her presence ( very affectionately , I must allow ) , and she had attended Pet up - stairs -- you remember she was her maid . Perhaps Pet , having been out of sorts , may have been a little more inconsiderate than usual in requiring services of her : but I do n’t know that I have any right to say so ; she was always thoughtful and gentle . ’
162197	162205	162076	162076	he	288	‘ The gentlest mistress in the world . ’
162206	162212	162214	162215	Mr Meagles	288	‘ Thank you , Clennam , ’
162223	162306	162214	162215	Mr Meagles	288	‘ you have often seen them together . Well ! We presently heard this unfortunate Tattycoram loud and angry , and before we could ask what was the matter , Pet came back in a tremble , saying she was frightened of her . Close after her came Tattycoram in a flaming rage . “ I hate you all three , ” says she , stamping her foot at us . “ I am bursting with hate of the whole house . ” ’
162307	162312	162351	162352	Mr Meagles	288	‘ Upon which you-- ? ’
162313	162316	162318	162319	Mr Meagles	288	‘ I ? ’
162337	162350	162335	162335	herself	576	‘ I said , count five - and - twenty , Tattycoram . ’
162369	162753	162351	162352	Mr Meagles	288	‘ She was so used to do it , Clennam , that even then , such a picture of passion as you never saw , she stopped short , looked me full in the face , and counted ( as I made out ) to eight . But she could n’t control herself to go any further . There she broke down , poor thing , and gave the other seventeen to the four winds . Then it all burst out . She detested us , she was miserable with us , she could n’t bear it , she would n’t bear it , she was determined to go away . She was younger than her young mistress , and would she remain to see her always held up as the only creature who was young and interesting , and to be cherished and loved ? No . She would n’t , she would n’t , she would n’t ! What did we think she , Tattycoram , might have been if she had been caressed and cared for in her childhood , like her young mistress ? As good as her ? Ah ! Perhaps fifty times as good . When we pretended to be so fond of one another , we exulted over her ; that was what we did ; we exulted over her and shamed her . And all in the house did the same . They talked about their fathers and mothers , and brothers and sisters ; they liked to drag them up before her face . There was Mrs Tickit , only yesterday , when her little grandchild was with her , had been amused by the child ’s trying to call her ( Tattycoram ) by the wretched name we gave her ; and had laughed at the name . Why , who did n’t ; and who were we that we should have a right to name her like a dog or a cat ? But she did n’t care . She would take no more benefits from us ; she would fling us her name back again , and she would go . She would leave us that minute , nobody should stop her , and we should never hear of her again . ’
162788	162793	162794	162794	he	288	‘ Ah , well ! ’
162801	162872	162794	162794	he	288	‘ It was of no use trying reason then , with that vehement panting creature ( Heaven knows what her mother ’s story must have been ) ; so I quietly told her that she should not go at that late hour of night , and I gave her my hand and took her to her room , and locked the house doors . But she was gone this morning . ’
162873	162882	162781	162781	he	288	‘ And you know no more of her ? ’
162883	162887	162889	162890	Mr Meagles	288	‘ No more , ’
162892	162922	162889	162890	Mr Meagles	288	‘ I have been hunting about all day . She must have gone very early and very silently . I have found no trace of her down about us . ’
162923	162929	162931	162931	Clennam	304	‘ Stay ! You want , ’
162939	162948	162931	162931	Clennam	304	‘ to see her ? I assume that ? ’
162949	162977	162979	162980	Mr Meagles	288	‘ Yes , assuredly ; I want to give her another chance ; Mother and Pet want to give her another chance ; come ! You yourself , ’
162998	163014	162979	162980	Mr Meagles	288	‘ want to give the poor passionate girl another chance , I know , Clennam . ’
163015	163028	163030	163030	Clennam	304	‘ It would be strange and hard indeed if I did not , ’
163032	163057	163030	163030	Clennam	304	‘ when you are all so forgiving . What I was going to ask you was , have you thought of that Miss Wade ? ’
163058	163135	162979	162980	Mr Meagles	288	‘ I have . I did not think of her until I had pervaded the whole of our neighbourhood , and I do n’t know that I should have done so then but for finding Mother and Pet , when I went home , full of the idea that Tattycoram must have gone to her . Then , of course , I recalled what she said that day at dinner when you were first with us . ’
163136	163149	162979	162980	Mr Meagles	288	‘ Have you any idea where Miss Wade is to be found ? ’
163150	163157	163159	163160	Mr Meagles	288	‘ To tell you the truth , ’
163162	163245	163159	163160	Mr Meagles	288	‘ it ’s because I have an addled jumble of a notion on that subject that you found me waiting here . There is one of those odd impressions in my house , which do mysteriously get into houses sometimes , which nobody seems to have picked up in a distinct form from anybody , and yet which everybody seems to have got hold of loosely from somebody and let go again , that she lives , or was living , thereabouts . ’
163278	163284	163286	163286	Arthur	304	‘ Here is no number , ’
163291	163299	163301	163302	his friend	10155	‘ No number , my dear Clennam ? ’
163304	163379	163380	163380	Clennam	304	‘ No anything ! The very name of the street may have been floating in the air ; for , as I tell you , none of my people can say where they got it from . However , it ’s worth an inquiry ; and as I would rather make it in company than alone , and as you too were a fellow - traveller of that immovable woman ’s , I thought perhaps-- ’
163594	163742	163782	163782	nobody	770	’ breeding in - and - in ; and , where their little supplementary bows and balconies were supported on thin iron columns , seemed to be scrofulously resting upon crutches . Here and there a Hatchment , with the whole science of Heraldry in it , loomed down upon the street , like an Archbishop discoursing on Vanity . The shops , few in number , made no show ; for popular opinion was as nothing to them . The pastrycook knew who was on his books , and in that knowledge could be calm , with a few glass cylinders of dowager peppermint - drops in his window , and half - a - dozen ancient specimens of currant - jelly . A few oranges formed the greengrocer ’s whole concession to the vulgar mind . A single basket made of moss , once containing plovers ’
164217	164227	164210	164210	himself	4621	‘ It is clear she do n’t live there , ’
164267	164270	164272	164273	Mr Meagles	288	‘ Empty , ’
164277	164281	164283	164283	Clennam	304	‘ Once more , ’
164337	164343	164345	164345	Clennam	304	‘ Excuse our troubling you , ’
164347	164358	164345	164345	Clennam	304	‘ Pray can you tell us where Miss Wade lives ? ’
164367	164371	164359	164363	The voice in the darkness	4626	‘ Lives here . ’

164450	164465	164436	164439	the figure rustling away	4628	‘ Come up , if you please ; you ca n’t tumble over anything . ’
164503	164510	164512	164513	Mr Meagles	288	‘ This is odd , Clennam , ’
164517	164521	164512	164513	Mr Meagles	288	‘ Odd enough , ’
164529	164547	164523	164523	Clennam	304	‘ but we have succeeded ; that ’s the main point . Here ’s a light coming ! ’
164570	164576	164577	164577	she	1243	‘ She ’s at home , ’
164592	164598	164577	164577	she	1243	‘ she ’ll come directly . ’
164867	164871	164872	164872	she	305	‘ I apprehend , ’
164875	164897	164872	164872	she	305	‘ that I know the cause of your favouring me with this visit . We may come to it at once . ’
164898	164905	164907	164908	Mr Meagles	288	‘ The cause then , ma’am , ’
164910	164914	164872	164872	she	305	‘ is Tattycoram . ’
164915	164920	164872	164872	she	305	‘ So I supposed . ’
164921	164925	164927	164928	Mr Meagles	288	‘ Miss Wade , ’
164930	164946	164927	164928	Mr Meagles	288	‘ will you be so kind as to say whether you know anything of her ? ’
164947	164958	164872	164872	she	305	‘ Surely . I know she is here with me . ’
164959	164964	164966	164967	Mr Meagles	288	‘ Then , ma’am , ’
164969	165029	164966	164967	Mr Meagles	288	‘ allow me to make known to you that I shall be happy to have her back , and that my wife and daughter will be happy to have her back . She has been with us a long time : we do n’t forget her claims upon us , and I hope we know how to make allowances . ’
165030	165040	165041	165041	she	4647	‘ You hope to know how to make allowances ? ’
165051	165055	165041	165041	she	4647	‘ For what ? ’
165056	165067	165068	165069	Arthur Clennam	304	‘ I think my friend would say , Miss Wade , ’
165080	165108	165068	165069	Arthur Clennam	304	‘ for the passionate sense that sometimes comes upon the poor girl , of being at a disadvantage . Which occasionally gets the better of better remembrances . ’
165123	165126	165116	165116	she	3830	‘ Indeed ? ’
165185	165201	165182	165182	Arthur	304	‘ Perhaps it would be well if Mr Meagles could see her , Miss Wade ? ’
165202	165208	165210	165210	she	3830	‘ That is easily done , ’
165212	165218	165219	165219	She	3830	‘ Come here , child . ’
165311	165315	165316	165316	she	3830	‘ See here , ’
165327	165542	165316	165316	she	3830	‘ Here is your patron , your master . He is willing to take you back , my dear , if you are sensible of the favour and choose to go . You can be , again , a foil to his pretty daughter , a slave to her pleasant wilfulness , and a toy in the house showing the goodness of the family . You can have your droll name again , playfully pointing you out and setting you apart , as it is right that you should be pointed out and set apart . ( Your birth , you know ; you must not forget your birth . ) You can again be shown to this gentleman ’s daughter , Harriet , and kept before her , as a living reminder of her own superiority and her gracious condescension . You can recover all these advantages and many more of the same kind which I dare say start up in your memory while I speak , and which you lose in taking refuge with me -- you can recover them all by telling these gentlemen how humbled and penitent you are , and by going back to them to be forgiven . What do you say , Harriet ? Will you go ? ’
165588	165594	165567	165567	her	4653	‘ I ’d die sooner ! ’
165616	165626	165595	165596	Miss Wade	305	‘ Gentlemen ! What do you do upon that ? ’

165668	165703	165666	165666	he	288	‘ for I ’ll call you by that name still , my good girl , conscious that I meant nothing but kindness when I gave it to you , and conscious that you know it-- ’
165704	165709	165711	165711	she	305	‘ I do n’t ! ’
165727	165735	165737	165738	Mr Meagles	288	‘ No , not now , perhaps , ’
165740	165754	165755	165755	she	305	‘ not with that lady ’s eyes so intent upon you , Tattycoram , ’
165763	165914	165755	165755	she	305	‘ and that power over you , which we see she exercises ; not now , perhaps , but at another time . Tattycoram , I ’ll not ask that lady whether she believes what she has said , even in the anger and ill blood in which I and my friend here equally know she has spoken , though she subdues herself , with a determination that any one who has once seen her is not likely to forget . I ’ll not ask you , with your remembrance of my house and all belonging to it , whether you believe it . I ’ll only say that you have no profession to make to me or mine , and no forgiveness to entreat ; and that all in the world that I ask you to do , is , to count five - and - twenty , Tattycoram . ’
165928	165942	165915	165915	She	4655	‘ I wo n’t . Miss Wade , take me away , please . ’
165990	166003	166004	166004	she	4655	‘ I wo n’t . I wo n’t . I wo n’t ! ’
166013	166030	166004	166004	she	4655	‘ I ’d be torn to pieces first . I ’d tear myself to pieces first ! ’

166082	166089	166091	166092	Mr Meagles	288	‘ Oh , Tattycoram , Tattycoram ! ’
166102	166196	166060	166060	her	305	‘ Hear that lady ’s voice , look at that lady ’s face , consider what is in that lady ’s heart , and think what a future lies before you . My child , whatever you may think , that lady ’s influence over you -- astonishing to us , and I should hardly go too far in saying terrible to us to see -- is founded in passion fiercer than yours , and temper more violent than yours . What can you two be together ? What can come of it ? ’
166197	166205	166207	166208	Miss Wade	305	‘ I am alone here , gentlemen , ’
166218	166224	166207	166208	Miss Wade	305	‘ Say anything you will . ’
166225	166236	166238	166239	Mr Meagles	288	‘ Politeness must yield to this misguided girl , ma’am , ’
166241	166392	166238	166239	Mr Meagles	288	‘ at her present pass ; though I hope not altogether to dismiss it , even with the injury you do her so strongly before me . Excuse me for reminding you in her hearing -- I must say it -- that you were a mystery to all of us , and had nothing in common with any of us when she unfortunately fell in your way . I do n’t know what you are , but you do n’t hide , ca n’t hide , what a dark spirit you have within you . If it should happen that you are a woman , who , from whatever cause , has a perverted delight in making a sister - woman as wretched as she is ( I am old enough to have heard of such ) , I warn her against you , and I warn you against yourself . ’
166393	166396	166398	166399	Miss Wade	305	‘ Gentlemen ! ’
166403	166418	166398	166399	Miss Wade	305	‘ When you have concluded -- Mr Clennam , perhaps you will induce your friend-- ’
166419	166425	166427	166428	Mr Meagles	288	‘ Not without another effort , ’
166432	166447	166427	166428	Mr Meagles	288	‘ Tattycoram , my poor dear girl , count five - and - twenty . ’
166448	166464	166466	166466	Clennam	304	‘ Do not reject the hope , the certainty , this kind man offers you , ’
166473	166487	166466	166466	Clennam	304	‘ Turn to the friends you have not forgotten . Think once more ! ’
166488	166496	166498	166499	the girl	9864	‘ I wo n’t ! Miss Wade , ’
166517	166522	166510	166510	her	9864	‘ take me away ! ’
166523	166526	166528	166529	Mr Meagles	288	‘ Tattycoram , ’
166531	166557	166528	166529	Mr Meagles	288	‘ Once more yet ! The only thing I ask of you in the world , my child ! Count five - and - twenty ! ’
166662	166675	166676	166676	she	9864	‘ As it is the last time I shall have the honour , ’
166679	166752	166676	166676	she	9864	‘ and as you have spoken of not knowing what I am , and also of the foundation of my influence here , you may now know that it is founded in a common cause . What your broken plaything is as to birth , I am . She has no name , I have no name . Her wrong is my wrong . I have nothing more to say to you . ’
166825	166863	166867	166867	Nobody	770	‘ I hope the wife of your dear friend Mr Gowan , may be happy in the contrast of her extraction to this girl ’s and mine , and in the high good fortune that awaits her . ’
168003	168056	167994	167994	She	436	‘ You wonder to see me here by myself ? But the evening is so lovely , I have strolled further than I meant at first . I thought it likely I might meet you , and that made me more confident . You always come this way , do you not ? ’
168082	168140	168069	168069	her	436	‘ Will you let me give you one , Mr Clennam ? I gathered them as I came out of the garden . Indeed , I almost gathered them for you , thinking it so likely I might meet you . Mr Doyce arrived more than an hour ago , and told us you were walking down . ’
168189	168196	168198	168198	Clennam	304	‘ It is very grave here , ’
168200	168242	168198	168198	Clennam	304	‘ but very pleasant at this hour . Passing along this deep shade , and out at that arch of light at the other end , we come upon the ferry and the cottage by the best approach , I think . ’
168392	168399	168388	168388	he	304	‘ they are to be married . ’
168400	168404	168405	168405	she	436	‘ Mr Clennam , ’
168426	168478	168405	168405	she	436	‘ I should very much like to give you my confidence , if you would not mind having the goodness to receive it . I should have very much liked to have given it to you long ago , because -- I felt that you were becoming so much our friend . ’
168479	168503	168424	168424	her	436	‘ How can I be otherwise than proud of it at any time ! Pray give it to me . Pray trust me . ’
168504	168515	168516	168516	she	436	‘ I could never have been afraid of trusting you , ’
168527	168554	168516	168516	she	436	‘ I think I would have done so some time ago , if I had known how . But I scarcely know how , even now . ’
168555	168559	168561	168562	Arthur Clennam	304	‘ Mr Gowan , ’
168564	168579	168580	168580	She	436	‘ has reason to be very happy . God bless his wife and him ! ’
168824	168845	168816	168816	she	436	‘ O Mr Clennam ! Good , generous , Mr Clennam , pray tell me you do not blame me . ’
168846	168851	168853	168853	Clennam	304	‘ I blame you ? ’
168855	168866	168853	168853	Clennam	304	‘ My dearest girl ! I blame you ? No ! ’
168941	168949	168953	168953	Clennam	304	‘ And , now , Minnie Gowan , ’
168957	168964	168953	168953	Clennam	304	‘ will you ask me nothing ? ’
168965	168977	168953	168953	Clennam	304	‘ Oh ! I have very much to ask of you . ’
168978	168992	168953	168953	Clennam	304	‘ That ’s well ! I hope so ; I am not disappointed . ’
168993	169020	169021	169021	she	436	‘ You know how I am loved at home , and how I love home . You can hardly think it perhaps , dear Mr Clennam , ’
169027	169049	169021	169021	she	436	‘ seeing me going from it of my own free will and choice , but I do so dearly love it ! ’
169050	169057	169059	169059	Clennam	304	‘ I am sure of that , ’
169061	169069	169059	169059	Clennam	304	‘ Can you suppose I doubt it ? ’
169070	169115	168953	168953	Clennam	304	‘ No , no . But it is strange , even to me , that loving it so much and being so much beloved in it , I can bear to cast it away . It seems so neglectful of it , so unthankful . ’
169116	169121	169123	169123	Clennam	304	‘ My dear girl , ’
169125	169143	169123	169123	Clennam	304	‘ it is in the natural progress and change of time . All homes are left so . ’
169144	169209	168953	168953	Clennam	304	‘ Yes , I know ; but all homes are not left with such a blank in them as there will be in mine when I am gone . Not that there is any scarcity of far better and more endearing and more accomplished girls than I am ; not that I am much , but that they have made so much of me ! ’
169227	169360	169221	169221	she	291	‘ I know what a change papa will feel at first , and I know that at first I can not be to him anything like what I have been these many years . And it is then , Mr Clennam , then more than at any time , that I beg and entreat you to remember him , and sometimes to keep him company when you can spare a little while ; and to tell him that you know I was fonder of him when I left him , than I ever was in all my life . For there is nobody -- he told me so himself when he talked to me this very day -- there is nobody he likes so well as you , or trusts so much . ’
169423	169432	169434	169434	Pet	291	‘ If I do not speak of mama , ’
169530	169549	169527	169527	you	1074	’ Let Minnie trust him , Clennam said , let Minnie trust him to do all she wished . ‘
169556	169560	169527	169527	you	1074	’ said Minnie , ‘
169724	169882	169709	169709	you	304	’ Poor Pet ! Self - deceived , mistaken child ! When were such changes ever made in men ’s natural relations to one another : when was such reconcilement of ingrain differences ever effected ! It has been tried many times by other daughters , Minnie ; it has never succeeded ; nothing has ever come of it but failure . So Clennam thought . So he did not say ; it was too late . He bound himself to do all she asked , and she knew full well that he would do it . They were now at the last tree in the avenue . She stopped , and withdrew her arm . Speaking to him with her eyes lifted up to his , and with the hand that had lately rested on his sleeve trembling by touching one of the roses in his breast as an additional appeal to him , she said : ‘
169964	170008	169960	169960	your	304	’ He stooped to meet the guileless face that met his without shrinking . He kissed it , and answered , Heaven knew that he had nothing to forgive . As he stooped to meet the innocent face once again , she whispered , ‘
170013	170107	170108	170108	She	4726	’ and he repeated it . It was taking leave of all his old hopes -- all nobody ’s old restless doubts . They came out of the avenue next moment , arm - in - arm as they had entered it : and the trees seemed to close up behind them in the darkness , like their own perspective of the past . The voices of Mr and Mrs Meagles and Doyce were audible directly , speaking near the garden gate . Hearing Pet ’s name among them , Clennam called out , ‘
170115	170218	170108	170108	She	4726	’ There was some little wondering and laughing until they came up ; but as soon as they had all come together , it ceased , and Pet glided away . Mr Meagles , Doyce , and Clennam , without speaking , walked up and down on the brink of the river , in the light of the rising moon , for a few minutes ; and then Doyce lingered behind , and went into the house . Mr Meagles and Clennam walked up and down together for a few minutes more without speaking , until at length the former broke silence . ‘
170221	170237	170239	170239	you	304	’ said he , using that familiar address for the first time in their communication , ‘
170290	170291	170297	170297	You	304	’ ‘
170295	170296	170297	170297	You	304	’ ‘
170329	170330	170297	170297	You	304	’ ‘
170336	170337	170338	170338	Arthur	304	’ ‘
170340	170348	170338	170338	Arthur	304	’ said Mr Meagles , much subdued , ‘
170392	170393	170395	170395	you	0	’ ‘
170397	170401	170403	170403	you	0	’ murmured Clennam , ‘
170405	170411	170403	170403	you	0	’ And pressed his hand . ‘
170417	170424	170413	170413	you	0	’ said Mr Meagles , presently . ‘
170430	171126	170413	170413	you	0	’ Mr Meagles fell away , and he was left alone . When he had walked on the river ’s brink in the peaceful moonlight for some half an hour , he put his hand in his breast and tenderly took out the handful of roses . Perhaps he put them to his heart , perhaps he put them to his lips , but certainly he bent down on the shore and gently launched them on the flowing river . Pale and unreal in the moonlight , the river floated them away . The lights were bright within doors when he entered , and the faces on which they shone , his own face not excepted , were soon quietly cheerful . They talked of many subjects ( his partner never had had such a ready store to draw upon for the beguiling of the time ) , and so to bed , and to sleep . While the flowers , pale and unreal in the moonlight , floated away upon the river ; and thus do greater things that once were in our breasts , and near our hearts , flow from us to the eternal seas . CHAPTER 29 . Mrs Flintwinch goes on Dreaming The house in the city preserved its heavy dulness through all these transactions , and the invalid within it turned the same unvarying round of life . Morning , noon , and night , morning , noon , and night , each recurring with its accompanying monotony , always the same reluctant return of the same sequences of machinery , like a dragging piece of clockwork . The wheeled chair had its associated remembrances and reveries , one may suppose , as every place that is made the station of a human being has . Pictures of demolished streets and altered houses , as they formerly were when the occupant of the chair was familiar with them , images of people as they too used to be , with little or no allowance made for the lapse of time since they were seen ; of these , there must have been many in the long routine of gloomy days . To stop the clock of busy existence at the hour when we were personally sequestered from it , to suppose mankind stricken motionless when we were brought to a stand - still , to be unable to measure the changes beyond our view by any larger standard than the shrunken one of our own uniform and contracted existence , is the infirmity of many invalids , and the mental unhealthiness of almost all recluses . What scenes and actors the stern woman most reviewed , as she sat from season to season in her one dark room , none knew but herself . Mr Flintwinch , with his wry presence brought to bear upon her daily like some eccentric mechanical force , would perhaps have screwed it out of her , if there had been less resistance in her ; but she was too strong for him . So far as Mistress Affery was concerned , to regard her liege - lord and her disabled mistress with a face of blank wonder , to go about the house after dark with her apron over her head , always to listen for the strange noises and sometimes to hear them , and never to emerge from her ghostly , dreamy , sleep - waking state , was occupation enough for her . There was a fair stroke of business doing , as Mistress Affery made out , for her husband had abundant occupation in his little office , and saw more people than had been used to come there for some years . This might easily be , the house having been long deserted ; but he did receive letters , and comers , and keep books , and correspond . Moreover , he went about to other counting - houses , and to wharves , and docks , and to the Custom House , and to Garraway ’s Coffee House , and the Jerusalem Coffee House , and on ‘
171476	171485	171486	171486	he	396	‘ happening to find himself in that direction , ’
171520	171525	171527	171527	she	313	‘ Mr Casby knows , ’
171529	171549	171527	171527	she	313	‘ that I am not subject to changes . The change that I await here is the great change . ’
171550	171555	171557	171558	Mr Pancks	396	‘ Indeed , ma’am ? ’
171585	171592	171572	171572	her	4738	‘ You look nicely , ma’am . ’
171593	171602	171603	171603	she	313	‘ I bear what I have to bear , ’
171606	171615	171603	171603	she	313	‘ Do you what you have to do . ’
171616	171622	171624	171625	Mr Pancks	396	‘ Thank you , ma’am , ’
171627	171633	171624	171625	Mr Pancks	396	‘ such is my endeavour . ’
171634	171646	171648	171649	Mrs Clennam	313	‘ You are often in this direction , are you not ? ’
171651	171658	171660	171660	Pancks	396	‘ Why , yes , ma’am , ’
171662	171685	171660	171660	Pancks	396	‘ rather so lately ; I have lately been round this way a good deal , owing to one thing and another . ’
171686	171740	171751	171752	Mr Pancks	396	‘ Beg Mr Casby and his daughter not to trouble themselves , by deputy , about me . When they wish to see me , they know I am here to see them . They have no need to trouble themselves to send . You have no need to trouble yourself to come . ’
171741	171749	171751	171752	Mr Pancks	396	‘ Not the least trouble , ma’am , ’
171754	171764	171751	171752	Mr Pancks	396	‘ You really are looking uncommonly nicely , ma’am . ’
171765	171772	171751	171752	Mr Pancks	396	‘ Thank you . Good evening . ’
171822	171827	171804	171804	He	396	‘ Good evening , ma ‘
171846	171960	171961	171962	Little Dorrit	274	’ and steamed out . Mrs Clennam , her chin resting on her hand , followed him with attentive and darkly distrustful eyes ; and Affery stood looking at her as if she were spell - bound . Slowly and thoughtfully , Mrs Clennam ’s eyes turned from the door by which Pancks had gone out , to Little Dorrit , rising from the carpet . With her chin drooping more heavily on her hand , and her eyes vigilant and lowering , the sick woman sat looking at her until she attracted her attention . Little Dorrit coloured under such a gaze , and looked down . Mrs Clennam still sat intent . ‘
171964	171975	171961	171962	Little Dorrit	274	’ she said , when she at last broke silence , ‘
171984	171985	171978	171978	you	274	’ ‘
172012	172013	172006	172006	he	1924	’ ‘

172043	172044	172032	172032	he	1924	’ ‘
172054	172055	172047	172047	he	1924	’ ‘
172063	172072	172056	172056	I	0	’ said Little Dorrit , with perfect frankness . ‘
172084	172085	172076	172076	he	1924	’ ‘
172091	172096	172076	172076	he	1924	’ said Little Dorrit . ‘
172115	172231	172110	172110	I	0	’ Mrs Clennam cast her eyes towards the ground , and with her strong , set face , as intent upon a subject in her mind as it had lately been upon the form that seemed to pass out of her view , sat absorbed . Some minutes elapsed before she came out of this thoughtfulness , and resumed her hard composure . Little Dorrit in the meanwhile had been waiting to go , but afraid to disturb her by moving . She now ventured to leave the spot where she had been standing since she had risen , and to pass gently round by the wheeled chair . She stopped at its side to say ‘
172237	172280	172235	172235	ma’am	10131	’ Mrs Clennam put out her hand , and laid it on her arm . Little Dorrit , confused under the touch , stood faltering . Perhaps some momentary recollection of the story of the Princess may have been in her mind . ‘
172287	172292	172235	172235	ma’am	10131	’ said Mrs Clennam , ‘
172299	172300	172294	172294	you	274	’ ‘
172317	172318	172310	172311	Miss Flora	499	’ ‘
172321	172336	172337	172338	that man	1924	’ said Mrs Clennam , with her unbent finger again pointing to the door , ‘
172340	172341	172337	172338	that man	1924	’ ‘
172347	172348	172337	172338	that man	1924	’ ‘
172356	172357	172358	172359	No ma’am	4757	’ ‘
172361	172369	172358	172359	No ma’am	4757	’ Little Dorrit earnestly shook her head . ‘
172385	172386	172358	172359	No ma’am	4757	’ ‘
172389	172397	172358	172359	No ma’am	4757	’ said Mrs Clennam , almost smiling . ‘
172438	172439	172442	172442	ma’am	10131	’ ‘
172473	172474	172475	172475	We	4762	’ ‘
172477	172500	172475	172475	We	4762	’ repeated Mrs Clennam , looking towards the watch , once her dead husband ’s , which always lay upon her table . ‘
172507	172508	172509	172510	Only father	4763	’ ‘
172532	172533	172516	172516	I	0	’ ‘
172553	172570	172542	172543	your father	9882	’ asked Mrs Clennam , speaking deliberately , and meditatively turning the watch over and over . ‘
172580	172595	172542	172543	your father	9882	’ said Little Dorrit , in her soft voice , and timid uncomplaining way ; ‘
172612	172613	172597	172597	I	0	’ ‘
172619	172625	172597	172597	I	0	’ Mrs Clennam quickly returned . ‘
172652	172653	172647	172647	I	0	’ ‘
172670	172675	172676	172676	I	0	’ said Little Dorrit . ‘
172680	172716	172676	172676	I	0	’ Mrs Clennam , with a gentleness of which the dreaming Affery had never dreamed her to be capable , drew down the face of her little seamstress , and kissed her on the forehead . ‘
172723	172727	172720	172721	Little Dorrit	274	’ said she , ‘
172737	172907	172908	172908	Pancks	396	’ In all the dreams Mistress Affery had been piling up since she first became devoted to the pursuit , she had dreamed nothing more astonishing than this . Her head ached with the idea that she would find the other clever one kissing Little Dorrit next , and then the two clever ones embracing each other and dissolving into tears of tenderness for all mankind . The idea quite stunned her , as she attended the light footsteps down the stairs , that the house door might be safely shut . On opening it to let Little Dorrit out , she found Mr Pancks , instead of having gone his way , as in any less wonderful place and among less wonderful phenomena he might have been reasonably expected to do , fluttering up and down the court outside the house . The moment he saw Little Dorrit , he passed her briskly , said with his finger to his nose ( as Mrs Affery distinctly heard ) , ‘
172916	172921	172908	172908	Pancks	396	’ and went away . ‘
172939	172944	172931	172934	a fortune - teller	12221	’ cried Mistress Affery . ‘
172948	173056	172931	172934	a fortune - teller	12221	’ She stood at the open door , staggering herself with this enigma , on a rainy , thundery evening . The clouds were flying fast , and the wind was coming up in gusts , banging some neighbouring shutters that had broken loose , twirling the rusty chimney - cowls and weather - cocks , and rushing round and round a confined adjacent churchyard as if it had a mind to blow the dead citizens out of their graves . The low thunder , muttering in all quarters of the sky at once , seemed to threaten vengeance for this attempted desecration , and to mutter , ‘
173065	173129	172931	172934	a fortune - teller	12221	’ Mistress Affery , whose fear of thunder and lightning was only to be equalled by her dread of the haunted house with a premature and preternatural darkness in it , stood undecided whether to go in or not , until the question was settled for her by the door blowing upon her in a violent gust of wind and shutting her out . ‘
173144	173160	172931	172934	a fortune - teller	12221	’ cried Mistress Affery , wringing her hands in this last uneasy dream of all ; ‘
173185	173397	172931	172934	a fortune - teller	12221	’ In this dilemma , Mistress Affery , with her apron as a hood to keep the rain off , ran crying up and down the solitary paved enclosure several times . Why she should then stoop down and look in at the keyhole of the door as if an eye would open it , it would be difficult to say ; but it is none the less what most people would have done in the same situation , and it is what she did . From this posture she started up suddenly , with a half scream , feeling something on her shoulder . It was the touch of a hand ; of a man ’s hand . The man was dressed like a traveller , in a foraging cap with fur about it , and a heap of cloak . He looked like a foreigner . He had a quantity of hair and moustache -- jet black , except at the shaggy ends , where it had a tinge of red -- and a high hook nose . He laughed at Mistress Affery ’s start and cry ; and as he laughed , his moustache went up under his nose , and his nose came down over his moustache . ‘
173403	173410	172931	172934	a fortune - teller	12221	’ he asked in plain English . ‘
173417	173418	173413	173413	you	4776	’ ‘
173422	173426	173413	173413	you	4776	’ panted Affery . ‘
173431	173432	173413	173413	you	4776	’ ‘
173443	173447	173413	173413	you	4776	’ said Affery . ‘
173468	173469	173462	173462	I	0	’ ‘
173472	173483	173462	173462	I	0	’ said the gentleman , who took that very coolly . ‘
173497	173498	173487	173487	you	4776	’ ‘
173515	173530	173512	173512	I	0	’ cried Affery , exasperated into a new wringing of hands by the inquiry . ‘
173535	173536	173512	173512	I	0	’ ‘
173539	173551	173512	173512	I	0	’ cried Affery , goaded into another inspection of the keyhole . ‘
173597	173611	173593	173593	Lord	4784	’ cried Affery , driven into a frantic dance by these accumulated considerations , ‘
173625	173669	173613	173613	I	0	’ Taking a warmer view of the matter now that it concerned himself , the gentleman stepped back to glance at the house , and his eye soon rested on the long narrow window of the little room near the hall - door . ‘
173686	173706	173613	173613	I	0	’ he inquired , with that peculiar smile which Mistress Affery could not choose but keep her eyes upon . ‘
173710	173714	173613	173613	I	0	’ said Affery . ‘
173719	173720	173613	173613	I	0	’ ‘
173768	173769	173761	173761	I	0	’ ‘
173788	173792	173794	173794	she	3830	’ cried Affery , ‘
173847	173848	173851	173853	my good madam	4791	’ ‘
173855	173866	173851	173853	my good madam	4791	’ He restrained her impatience with a smooth white hand . ‘
173880	173881	173851	173853	my good madam	4791	’ ‘
173888	173892	173851	173853	my good madam	4791	’ cried Affery . ‘
173896	173897	173851	173853	my good madam	4791	’ ‘
173931	173982	173983	173983	I	0	’ He showed her that his cloak was very wet , and that his boots were saturated with water ; she had previously observed that he was dishevelled and sallow , as if from a rough voyage , and so chilled that he could not keep his teeth from chattering . ‘
174078	174237	174077	174077	I’ll--	0	’ and with the same smile he made a significant feint of backing away . Mistress Affery , heartily glad to effect the proposed compromise , gave in her willing adhesion to it . The gentleman at once requested her to do him the favour of holding his cloak , took a short run at the narrow window , made a leap at the sill , clung his way up the bricks , and in a moment had his hand at the sash , raising it . His eyes looked so very sinister , as he put his leg into the room and glanced round at Mistress Affery , that she thought with a sudden coldness , if he were to go straight up - stairs to murder the invalid , what could she do to prevent him ? Happily he had no such purpose ; for he reappeared , in a moment , at the house door . ‘
174244	174259	174261	174261	you	4798	’ he said , as he took back his cloak and threw it on , ‘
174273	174317	174261	174261	you	4798	’ The strangest of sounds . Evidently close at hand from the peculiar shock it communicated to the air , yet subdued as if it were far off . A tremble , a rumble , and a fall of some light dry matter . ‘
174324	174325	174326	174326	I	0	’ ‘
174347	174396	174335	174335	I	0	’ said Affery , who had caught his arm . He could hardly be a very brave man , even she thought in her dreamy start and fright , for his trembling lips had turned colourless . After listening a few moments , he made light of it . ‘
174429	174453	174417	174417	you	4798	’ He held the door in his hand , as though he were quite ready to shut her out again if she failed . ‘
174467	174471	174456	174456	you	4798	’ whispered Affery . ‘
174476	174477	174456	174456	you	4798	’ ‘
174499	174500	174501	174501	Madam	4777	’ ‘
174508	174657	174501	174501	Madam	4777	’ Affery had so vivid a fear of his going stealthily up - stairs the moment her back was turned , that after hurrying out of sight , she returned to the gateway to peep at him . Seeing him still on the threshold , more out of the house than in it , as if he had no love for darkness and no desire to probe its mysteries , she flew into the next street , and sent a message into the tavern to Mr Flintwinch , who came out directly . The two returning together -- the lady in advance , and Mr Flintwinch coming up briskly behind , animated with the hope of shaking her before she could get housed -- saw the gentleman standing in the same place in the dark , and heard the strong voice of Mrs Clennam calling from her room , ‘
174681	174720	174864	174865	my woman	3104	’ CHAPTER 30 . The Word of a Gentleman When Mr and Mrs Flintwinch panted up to the door of the old house in the twilight , Jeremiah within a second of Affery , the stranger started back . ‘
174726	174730	174864	174865	my woman	3104	’ he exclaimed . ‘
174739	174852	174735	174735	you	4806	’ Mr Flintwinch , to whom these words were spoken , repaid the stranger ’s wonder in full . He gazed at him with blank astonishment ; he looked over his own shoulder , as expecting to see some one he had not been aware of standing behind him ; he gazed at the stranger again , speechlessly , at a loss to know what he meant ; he looked to his wife for explanation ; receiving none , he pounced upon her , and shook her with such heartiness that he shook her cap off her head , saying between his teeth , with grim raillery , as he did it , ‘
174912	174979	174907	174907	I	0	’ Supposing Mistress Affery to have any power of election at the moment , her choice was decidedly to be choked ; for she answered not a syllable to this adjuration , but , with her bare head wagging violently backwards and forwards , resigned herself to her punishment . The stranger , however , picking up her cap with an air of gallantry , interposed . ‘
174983	175003	175005	175005	you	3104	’ said he , laying his hand on the shoulder of Jeremiah , who stopped and released his victim . ‘
175058	175080	175034	175034	I	0	’ This reference to Mrs Clennam ’s voice reminded Mr Flintwinch to step into the hall and call up the staircase . ‘
175097	175114	175090	175090	Affery	312	’ Then he said to the latter flustered woman , who was putting her cap on , ‘
175126	175138	175090	175090	Affery	312	’ and then turned to the stranger and said to him , ‘
175150	175151	175152	175152	I	0	’ ‘
175156	175161	175152	175152	I	0	’ said the stranger , ‘

175177	175181	175182	175182	I	0	’ assented Jeremiah . ‘
175200	175368	175409	175409	I	0	’ The visitor was standing in the doorway , but turned a little into the gloom of the house as Mr Flintwinch turned , and pursued him with his eyes into the little room , where he groped about for a phosphorus box . When he found it , it was damp , or otherwise out of order ; and match after match that he struck into it lighted sufficiently to throw a dull glare about his groping face , and to sprinkle his hands with pale little spots of fire , but not sufficiently to light the candle . The stranger , taking advantage of this fitful illumination of his visage , looked intently and wonderingly at him . Jeremiah , when he at last lighted the candle , knew he had been doing this , by seeing the last shade of a lowering watchfulness clear away from his face , as it broke into the doubtful smile that was a large ingredient in its expression . ‘
175373	175396	175409	175409	I	0	’ said Jeremiah , closing the house door , and taking a pretty sharp survey of the smiling visitor in his turn , ‘
175413	175438	175409	175409	I	0	’ petulantly breaking off to answer the voice up - stairs , still unsatisfied , though Affery was there , speaking in persuasive tones . ‘
175462	175463	175464	175464	Timorous	534	’ ‘
175466	175471	175472	175472	Timorous	534	’ remarked the stranger . ‘
175474	175493	175472	175472	Timorous	534	’ said Mr Flintwinch , turning his head to retort , as he went before with the candle . ‘
175510	175511	175513	175514	an invalid	4821	’ ‘
175516	175517	175520	175521	an invalid	4821	’ ‘
175541	175618	175619	175619	Your	4826	’ Saying something apologetically as he crossed the hall , to the effect that at that time of night they were not in the habit of receiving any one , and were always shut up , Mr Flintwinch led the way into his own office , which presented a sufficiently business - like appearance . Here he put the light on his desk , and said to the stranger , with his wryest twist upon him , ‘
175622	175623	175619	175619	Your	4826	’ ‘
175629	175630	175631	175631	Blandois	535	’ ‘
175639	175643	175633	175633	I	0	’ said Jeremiah . ‘
175649	175654	175671	175671	Paris	537	’ resumed the other , ‘
175663	175664	175662	175662	Paris--	536	’ ‘
175680	175684	175671	175671	Paris	537	’ said Jeremiah . ‘

175691	175740	175671	175671	Paris	537	’ Jeremiah stood in his favourite attitude . The smiling Mr Blandois , opening his cloak to get his hand to a breast - pocket , paused to say , with a laugh in his glittering eyes , which it occurred to Mr Flintwinch were too near together : ‘
175815	175816	175796	175796	I	0	’ ‘
175819	175825	175796	175796	I	0	’ said Jeremiah , perversely . ‘
175845	175846	175843	175843	Blandois	535	’ ‘
175850	175855	175843	175843	Blandois	535	’ said the stranger . ‘
175861	175915	175843	175843	Blandois	535	’ said Jeremiah . Mr Blandois , not at all put out by this omission on the part of the correspondents of the house of Clennam and Co. , took his pocket - book from his breast - pocket , selected a letter from that receptacle , and handed it to Mr Flintwinch . ‘
175978	175993	175975	175976	a gentleman	9715	’ Mr Flintwinch took the letter , and read , under date of Paris , ‘
176019	176026	175975	175976	a gentleman	9715	’ & amp;c . & amp;c . ‘
176043	176050	176096	176097	Mr Flintwinch	320	’ & amp;c . & amp;c . ‘
176062	176081	176096	176097	Mr Flintwinch	320	’ drafts at sight to the extent of , say Fifty Pounds sterling ( 50_l _ . ) , ’
176088	176094	176096	176097	Mr Flintwinch	320	‘ Very good , sir , ’
176099	176175	176096	176097	Mr Flintwinch	320	‘ Take a chair . To the extent of anything that our House can do -- we are in a retired , old - fashioned , steady way of business , sir -- we shall be happy to render you our best assistance . I observe , from the date of this , that we could not yet be advised of it . Probably you came over with the delayed mail that brings the advice . ’
176176	176188	176190	176191	Mr Blandois	535	‘ That I came over with the delayed mail , sir , ’
176204	176311	176194	176194	his	535	‘ I know to the cost of my head and stomach : the detestable and intolerable weather having racked them both . You see me in the plight in which I came out of the packet within this half - hour . I ought to have been here hours ago , and then I should not have to apologise -- permit me to apologise -- for presenting myself so unreasonably , and frightening -- no , by - the - bye , you said not frightening ; permit me to apologise again -- the esteemed lady , Mrs Clennam , in her invalid chamber above stairs . ’
176374	176377	176379	176380	that gentleman	2147	‘ Faith ! ’
176387	176444	176379	176380	that gentleman	2147	‘ I must change , and eat and drink , and be lodged somewhere . Have the kindness to advise me , a total stranger , where , and money is a matter of perfect indifference until to - morrow . The nearer the place , the better . Next door , if that ’s all . ’
176451	176468	176445	176446	Mr Flintwinch	320	‘ For a gentleman of your habits , there is not in this immediate neighbourhood any hotel-- ’
176476	176487	176489	176489	his	535	‘ So much for my habits ! my dear sir , ’
176492	176572	176489	176489	his	535	‘ A citizen of the world has no habits . That I am , in my poor way , a gentleman , by Heaven ! I will not deny , but I have no unaccommodating prejudiced habits . A clean room , a hot dish for dinner , and a bottle of not absolutely poisonous wine , are all I want tonight . But I want that much without the trouble of going one unnecessary inch to get it . ’
176573	176577	176579	176580	Mr Flintwinch	320	‘ There is , ’
176599	176607	176590	176590	he	320	’ shining eyes , which were restless ; ‘
176636	176637	176638	176638	I	0	’ ‘
176643	176652	176638	176638	I	0	’ said Mr Blandois , waving his hand . ‘
176683	176745	176638	176638	I	0	’ Mr Flintwinch , upon this , looked up his hat , and lighted Mr Blandois across the hall again . As he put the candle on a bracket , where the dark old panelling almost served as an extinguisher for it , he bethought himself of going up to tell the invalid that he would not be absent five minutes . ‘
176749	176759	176638	176638	I	0	’ said the visitor , on his saying so , ‘
176839	176852	176853	176853	She	313	’ Jeremiah made all despatch , and said , on his return , ‘
176898	176899	176880	176880	she	313	’ ‘
176906	176912	176880	176880	she	313	’ returned the gallant Blandois , ‘
176947	177491	177492	177492	Blandois	535	’ Thus expressing himself , he threw the draggled skirt of his cloak over his shoulder , and accompanied Mr Flintwinch to the tavern ; taking up on the road a porter who was waiting with his portmanteau on the outer side of the gateway . The house was kept in a homely manner , and the condescension of Mr Blandois was infinite . It seemed to fill to inconvenience the little bar in which the widow landlady and her two daughters received him ; it was much too big for the narrow wainscoted room with a bagatelle - board in it , that was first proposed for his reception ; it perfectly swamped the little private holiday sitting - room of the family , which was finally given up to him . Here , in dry clothes and scented linen , with sleeked hair , a great ring on each forefinger and a massive show of watch - chain , Mr Blandois waiting for his dinner , lolling on a window - seat with his knees drawn up , looked ( for all the difference in the setting of the jewel ) fearfully and wonderfully like a certain Monsieur Rigaud who had once so waited for his breakfast , lying on the stone ledge of the iron grating of a cell in a villainous dungeon at Marseilles . His greed at dinner , too , was closely in keeping with the greed of Monsieur Rigaud at breakfast . His avaricious manner of collecting all the eatables about him , and devouring some with his eyes while devouring others with his jaws , was the same manner . His utter disregard of other people , as shown in his way of tossing the little womanly toys of furniture about , flinging favourite cushions under his boots for a softer rest , and crushing delicate coverings with his big body and his great black head , had the same brute selfishness at the bottom of it . The softly moving hands that were so busy among the dishes had the old wicked facility of the hands that had clung to the bars . And when he could eat no more , and sat sucking his delicate fingers one by one and wiping them on a cloth , there wanted nothing but the substitution of vine - leaves to finish the picture . On this man , with his moustache going up and his nose coming down in that most evil of smiles , and with his surface eyes looking as if they belonged to his dyed hair , and had had their natural power of reflecting light stopped by some similar process , Nature , always true , and never working in vain , had set the mark , Beware ! It was not her fault , if the warning were fruitless . She is never to blame in any such instance . Mr Blandois , having finished his repast and cleaned his fingers , took a cigar from his pocket , and , lying on the window - seat again , smoked it out at his leisure , occasionally apostrophising the smoke as it parted from his thin lips in a thin stream : ‘
177641	177680	177628	177628	You	535	’ To such soothing murmurs did this gentleman smoke out his cigar and drink out his bottle of wine . Both being finished , he shook himself into a sitting attitude ; and with the concluding serious apostrophe , ‘
177698	177925	177926	177926	I	0	’ arose and went back to the house of Clennam and Co. He was received at the door by Mistress Affery , who , under instructions from her lord , had lighted up two candles in the hall and a third on the staircase , and who conducted him to Mrs Clennam ’s room . Tea was prepared there , and such little company arrangements had been made as usually attended the reception of expected visitors . They were slight on the greatest occasion , never extending beyond the production of the China tea - service , and the covering of the bed with a sober and sad drapery . For the rest , there was the bier - like sofa with the block upon it , and the figure in the widow ’s dress , as if attired for execution ; the fire topped by the mound of damped ashes ; the grate with its second little mound of ashes ; the kettle and the smell of black dye ; all as they had been for fifteen years . Mr Flintwinch presented the gentleman commended to the consideration of Clennam and Co. Mrs Clennam , who had the letter lying before her , bent her head and requested him to sit . They looked very closely at one another . That was but natural curiosity . ‘
177994	178044	177986	177986	I	0	’ Mr Blandois , in his most gentlemanly manner , was afraid he had disturbed her by unhappily presenting himself at such an unconscionable time . For which he had already offered his best apologies to Mr -- he begged pardon -- but by name had not the distinguished honour-- ‘
178056	178081	178082	178082	My	0	’ Mr Blandois was Mr Flintwinch ’s most obedient humble servant . He entreated Mr Flintwinch to receive the assurance of his profoundest consideration . ‘
178087	178092	178082	178083	My husband	9915	’ said Mrs Clennam , ‘
178114	178115	178111	178112	Mr Flintwinch	320	’ ‘
178122	178131	178118	178118	you	320	’ was the surly demand of that gentleman . ‘

178147	178163	178137	178138	two men	825	’ she proceeded with merely a slight turn of her eyes in Jeremiah ’s direction , ‘
178259	178260	178253	178253	You	320	’ ‘
178285	178298	178279	178279	I	0	’ said Mr Blandois , stretching out his leg and smiting it : ‘

178356	178369	178354	178354	Madam	4777	’ said Mr Blandois , with an ugly fall of his eyebrows , ‘
178384	178509	178510	178510	Affery	312	’ Mistress Affery , who stood at the table near him , pouring out the tea , happened in her dreamy state to look at him as he said these words , and to fancy that she caught an expression in his eyes which attracted her own eyes so that she could not get them away . The effect of this fancy was to keep her staring at him with the tea - pot in her hand , not only to her own great uneasiness , but manifestly to his , too ; and , through them both , to Mrs Clennam ’s and Mr Flintwinch ’s . Thus a few ghostly moments supervened , when they were all confusedly staring without knowing why . ‘
178512	178521	178510	178510	Affery	312	’ her mistress was the first to say , ‘
178529	178530	178531	178531	I	0	’ ‘
178536	178551	178531	178531	I	0	’ said Mistress Affery , with her disengaged left hand extended towards the visitor . ‘
178561	178562	178559	178559	him	4880	’ ‘
178570	178602	178565	178567	this good woman	4881	’ cried Mr Blandois , turning white , hot , and slowly rising with a look of such deadly wrath that it contrasted surprisingly with the slight force of his words . ‘
178613	178614	178640	178640	she	4881	’ ‘
178622	178634	178640	178640	she	4881	’ said Mr Flintwinch , screwing himself rapidly in that direction . ‘
178675	178682	178686	178686	you	0	’ he added in her ear , ‘
178692	178698	178686	178686	you	0	’re Affery , and before you ’re
178703	178754	178755	178755	You	0	’ Mistress Affery , sensible of the danger in which her identity stood , relinquished the tea - pot as her husband seized it , put her apron over her head , and in a twinkling vanished . The visitor gradually broke into a smile , and sat down again . ‘
178763	178773	178755	178755	You	0	’ said Jeremiah , pouring out the tea himself , ‘
178795	178796	178789	178789	you	535	’ ‘
178816	178900	178907	178907	you	535	’ The tea - table was drawn up near the sofa , with a small interval between it and Mrs Clennam ’s own particular table . Mr Blandois in his gallantry had risen to hand that lady her tea ( her dish of toast was already there ) , and it was in placing the cup conveniently within her reach that the watch , lying before her as it always did , attracted his attention . Mrs Clennam looked suddenly up at him . ‘
178916	178926	178969	178969	I	0	’ he said , taking it in his hand . ‘
179008	179009	178978	178978	you	535	’ ‘
179018	179023	178978	178978	you	535	’ said Mrs Clennam . ‘
179039	179040	179036	179036	I	0	’ ‘
179045	179046	179036	179036	I	0	’ ‘
179056	179069	179049	179049	they	4889	’ remarked Mr Blandois , glancing up with his own smile again . ‘
179083	179084	179049	179049	they	4889	’ ‘
179090	179148	179049	179049	they	4889	’ Mr Flintwinch , who had been observantly pausing all this time with a cup of tea in his hand , and his mouth open ready to swallow the contents , began to do so : always entirely filling his mouth before he emptied it at a gulp ; and always deliberating again before he refilled it . ‘
179168	179181	179163	179163	I	0	’ observed Mr Blandois , as he snapped on the case again . ‘
179231	179263	179229	179229	madam	4777	’ Mr Flintwinch had by this time poured himself out another cup of tea , which he was swallowing in gulps as before , with his eyes directed to the invalid . ‘
179274	179281	179264	179264	You	0	’ she returned to Mr Blandois . ‘
179298	179299	179288	179288	I	0	’ ‘
179306	179313	179288	179288	I	0	’ said Mr Blandois , casually . ‘
179331	179332	179323	179323	I	0	’ ‘
179336	179352	179323	179323	I	0	’ said Mr Blandois , replacing the watch and stepping backward to his former chair , ‘
179360	179461	179353	179353	you	0	’ Mr Flintwinch , finishing his tea , not only took a longer gulp than he had taken yet , but made his succeeding pause under new circumstances : that is to say , with his head thrown back and his cup held still at his lips , while his eyes were still directed at the invalid . She had that force of face , and that concentrated air of collecting her firmness or obstinacy , which represented in her case what would have been gesture and action in another , as she replied with her deliberate strength of speech : ‘
179562	179622	179626	179626	madam	4777	’ Mr Flintwinch , who had latterly been shaking the sediment at the bottom of his tea - cup , round and round , here gulped it down , and putting the cup in the tea - tray , as done with , turned his eyes upon Mr Blandois as if to ask him what he thought of that ? ‘
179628	179645	179626	179626	madam	4777	’ said Mr Blandois , with his smoothest bow and his white hand on his breast , ‘
179677	179678	179626	179626	madam	4777	’ ‘
179684	179688	179626	179626	madam	4777	’ she returned , ‘
179713	179714	179729	179731	such a character	4901	’ ‘
179721	179722	179719	179719	Heaven	309	’ ‘
179749	179763	179782	179782	I	0	’ she looked at the rigid pile of hard pale books before her , ‘
179841	179873	179830	179830	I	0	’ It was curious how she seized the occasion to argue with some invisible opponent . Perhaps with her own better sense , always turning upon herself and her own deception . ‘
180100	180197	180085	180085	I	0	’ As she spoke these words , she put her hand upon the watch , and restored it to the precise spot on her little table which it always occupied . With her touch lingering upon it , she sat for some moments afterwards , looking at it steadily and half - defiantly . Mr Blandois , during this exposition , had been strictly attentive , keeping his eyes fastened on the lady , and thoughtfully stroking his moustache with his two hands . Mr Flintwinch had been a little fidgety , and now struck in . ‘
180204	180208	180085	180085	I	0	’ said he . ‘
180238	180239	180225	180226	Mr Blandois	535	’ ‘
180246	180255	180244	180244	sir	933	’ that gentleman protested , snapping his fingers . ‘
180299	180369	180289	180290	Mr Flintwinch	320	’ There was an inkling of suspicion in Mr Flintwinch ’s face that he might be nothing , as he swaggered out of his chair ( it was characteristic of this man , as it is of all men similarly marked , that whatever he did , he overdid , though it were sometimes by only a hairsbreadth ) , and approached to take his leave of Mrs Clennam . ‘
180386	180391	180379	180382	a sick old woman	4912	’ she then said , ‘
180443	180453	180440	180440	you	933	’ For he was evidently going to do it . ‘
180477	180490	180466	180466	I	0	’ Mr Blandois thanked her , and kissed his hand several times . ‘
180497	180517	180518	180518	I	0	’ he remarked , with a sudden sprightliness of manner , looking round when he got near the door , ‘
180538	180539	180581	180582	Mr Flintwinch	320	’ ‘
180547	180557	180581	180582	Mr Flintwinch	320	’ said Mrs Clennam , with her frozen smile . ‘
180570	180571	180581	180582	Mr Flintwinch	320	’ ‘
180574	180579	180581	180582	Mr Flintwinch	320	’ cried the visitor . ‘
180670	180671	180672	180672	I	0	’ ‘
180691	180700	180681	180681	you	0	’ said Jeremiah , taking up the candle . ‘
180709	180747	180748	180748	You	0	’But Mr Blandois , smiting him in a friendly manner on the back , only laughed ; so the said Blandois kissed his hand again to Mrs Clennam , and they went out of the room together . ‘
180758	180766	180748	180748	You	0	’ said Jeremiah , on the landing . ‘
180785	180823	180826	180827	Mr Blandois	535	’ Mr Flintwinch , therefore , wormed himself up the staircase , and Mr Blandois followed close . They ascended to the great garret bed - room which Arthur had occupied on the night of his return . ‘
180829	180836	180826	180827	Mr Blandois	535	’ said Jeremiah , showing it , ‘
180856	181077	180852	180852	I	0	’ Mr Blandois being enraptured , they walked through other garrets and passages , and came down the staircase again . By this time Mr Flintwinch had remarked that he never found the visitor looking at any room , after throwing one quick glance around , but always found the visitor looking at him , Mr Flintwinch . With this discovery in his thoughts , he turned about on the staircase for another experiment . He met his eyes directly ; and on the instant of their fixing one another , the visitor , with that ugly play of nose and moustache , laughed ( as he had done at every similar moment since they left Mrs Clennam ’s chamber ) a diabolically silent laugh . As a much shorter man than the visitor , Mr Flintwinch was at the physical disadvantage of being thus disagreeably leered at from a height ; and as he went first down the staircase , and was usually a step or two lower than the other , this disadvantage was at the time increased . He postponed looking at Mr Blandois again until this accidental inequality was removed by their having entered the late Mr Clennam ’s room . But , then twisting himself suddenly round upon him , he found his look unchanged . ‘
181084	181089	180852	180852	I	0	’ smiled Mr Blandois . ‘
181102	181103	181094	181094	you	4923	’ ‘
181106	181111	181094	181094	you	4923	’ returned Mr Flintwinch . ‘
181114	181115	181094	181094	you	4923	’ ‘
181121	181122	181118	181119	any devils	4924	’ ‘
181125	181137	181118	181119	any devils	4924	’ said Mr Flintwinch , grimly screwing himself at his questioner , ‘
181151	181152	181142	181142	themselves	4924	’ ‘
181162	181178	181159	181159	I	0	’ ( Still looking at Mr Flintwinch , as if he were the portrait . ) ‘

181201	181202	181198	181199	Mr Flintwinch	320	’ ‘

181222	181257	181260	181261	Mr Blandois	535	’ said the visitor . Mr Flintwinch , who had cast his eyes towards the portrait , twisted himself about again , and again found himself the subject of the same look and smile . ‘
181263	181268	181260	181261	Mr Blandois	535	’ he replied tartly . ‘
181299	181300	181291	181291	I	0	’ ‘
181317	181318	181308	181309	Mr Flintwinch	320	’ ‘
181323	181372	181308	181309	Mr Flintwinch	320	’ said Jeremiah , twisting himself at the visitor again , as he did during the whole of this dialogue , like some screw - machine that fell short of its grip ; for the other never changed , and he always felt obliged to retreat a little . ‘
181387	181388	181389	181389	They	4939	’ ‘
181396	181400	181401	181401	Who	4940	’ said Blandois . ‘
181403	181462	181401	181401	Who	4940	’ demanded Mr Flintwinch , with another screw at him . Mr Blandois shook his right forefinger towards the sick room , and his left forefinger towards the portrait , and then , putting his arms akimbo and striding his legs wide apart , stood smiling down at Mr Flintwinch with the advancing nose and the retreating moustache . ‘
181474	181479	181471	181471	I	0	’ returned Mr Flintwinch . ‘
181497	181498	181494	181495	all families	4942	’ ‘
181501	181508	181471	181471	I	0	’ cried Mr Blandois , quickly . ‘
181516	181517	181518	181518	I	0	’ ‘
181521	181547	181548	181548	I	0	’ replied Mr Flintwinch , upon whom he had swelled himself so suddenly that Mr Flintwinch found his face almost brushed by the dilated chest . ‘
181557	181558	181548	181548	I	0	’ ‘
181563	181581	181548	181548	I	0	’ cried the other , clapping him on both shoulders , and rolling him backwards and forwards . ‘
181611	181690	181608	181609	Mr Flintwinch	320	’ With that , after clapping Mr Flintwinch on both shoulders several times , as if in a friendly and humorous way he were rallying him on a joke he had made , he threw up his arms , threw back his head , hooked his hands together behind it , and burst into a roar of laughter . It was in vain for Mr Flintwinch to try another screw at him . He had his laugh out . ‘
181701	181710	181694	181694	me	0	’ he said , when he had done . ‘
181726	181736	181755	181755	he	4948	’ holding up the light at arm ’s length . ‘
181782	181949	181779	181779	he	4948	’ As he returned the candle , he looked at him once more ; and then , leisurely strolling out with him into the hall , declared it to be a charming old house indeed , and one which had so greatly pleased him that he would not have missed inspecting it for a hundred pounds . Throughout these singular freedoms on the part of Mr Blandois , which involved a general alteration in his demeanour , making it much coarser and rougher , much more violent and audacious than before , Mr Flintwinch , whose leathern face was not liable to many changes , preserved its immobility intact . Beyond now appearing perhaps , to have been left hanging a trifle too long before that friendly operation of cutting down , he outwardly maintained an equable composure . They had brought their survey to a close in the little room at the side of the hall , and he stood there , eyeing Mr Blandois . ‘
181961	181967	181959	181959	sir	933	’ was his calm remark . ‘
181983	181984	181974	181974	You	4951	’ ‘
181989	181993	181974	181974	You	4951	’ returned Blandois . ‘
182013	182014	182005	182005	you	4951	’ ‘
182031	182036	182023	182023	you	933	’ replied that gentleman . ‘
182053	182054	182055	182055	I	0	’ ‘
182060	182069	182071	182072	Mr Flintwinch	320	’m sensible of such a sensation at present , ’
182078	182092	182071	182072	Mr Flintwinch	320	‘ If I should find it coming on , I ’ll mention it . ’
182093	182097	182099	182099	Blandois	535	‘ Now I , ’
182101	182127	182099	182099	Blandois	535	‘ I , my son , have a presentiment to - night that we shall be well acquainted . Do you find it coming on ? ’
182128	182133	182135	182136	Mr Flintwinch	320	‘ N - no , ’
182143	182151	182141	182141	himself	320	‘ I ca n’t say I do . ’
182152	182172	182179	182180	Mr Flintwinch	320	‘ I have a strong presentiment that we shall become intimately acquainted.--You have no feeling of that sort yet ? ’
182173	182177	182179	182180	Mr Flintwinch	320	‘ Not yet , ’
182300	182583	182584	182584	You	4959	’ room , a bottle of port wine was ordered by that gallant gentleman ; who ( crushing every pretty thing he could collect , in the soft disposition of his dainty figure ) coiled himself upon the window - seat , while Mr Flintwinch took a chair opposite to him , with the table between them . Mr Blandois proposed having the largest glasses in the house , to which Mr Flintwinch assented . The bumpers filled , Mr Blandois , with a roystering gaiety , clinked the top of his glass against the bottom of Mr Flintwinch ’s , and the bottom of his glass against the top of Mr Flintwinch ’s , and drank to the intimate acquaintance he foresaw . Mr Flintwinch gravely pledged him , and drank all the wine he could get , and said nothing . As often as Mr Blandois clinked glasses ( which was at every replenishment ) , Mr Flintwinch stolidly did his part of the clinking , and would have stolidly done his companion ’s part of the wine as well as his own : being , except in the article of palate , a mere cask . In short , Mr Blandois found that to pour port wine into the reticent Flintwinch was , not to open him but to shut him up . Moreover , he had the appearance of a perfect ability to go on all night ; or , if occasion were , all next day and all next night ; whereas Mr Blandois soon grew indistinctly conscious of swaggering too fiercely and boastfully . He therefore terminated the entertainment at the end of the third bottle . ‘
182595	182609	182584	182584	You	4959	’ said Mr Flintwinch , with a business - like face at parting . ‘
182613	182627	182584	182584	You	4959	’ returned the other , taking him by the collar with both hands , ‘
182647	182664	182668	182669	a gentleman	9715	’ here he gave him a southern embrace , and kissed him soundly on both cheeks ; ‘
182682	183711	182676	182676	you	4959	’ He did not present himself next day , though the letter of advice came duly to hand . Inquiring after him at night , Mr Flintwinch found , with surprise , that he had paid his bill and gone back to the Continent by way of Calais . Nevertheless , Jeremiah scraped out of his cogitating face a lively conviction that Mr Blandois would keep his word on this occasion , and would be seen again . CHAPTER 31 . Spirit Anybody may pass , any day , in the thronged thoroughfares of the metropolis , some meagre , wrinkled , yellow old man ( who might be supposed to have dropped from the stars , if there were any star in the Heavens dull enough to be suspected of casting off so feeble a spark ) , creeping along with a scared air , as though bewildered and a little frightened by the noise and bustle . This old man is always a little old man . If he were ever a big old man , he has shrunk into a little old man ; if he were always a little old man , he has dwindled into a less old man . His coat is a colour , and cut , that never was the mode anywhere , at any period . Clearly , it was not made for him , or for any individual mortal . Some wholesale contractor measured Fate for five thousand coats of such quality , and Fate has lent this old coat to this old man , as one of a long unfinished line of many old men . It has always large dull metal buttons , similar to no other buttons . This old man wears a hat , a thumbed and napless and yet an obdurate hat , which has never adapted itself to the shape of his poor head . His coarse shirt and his coarse neckcloth have no more individuality than his coat and hat ; they have the same character of not being his -- of not being anybody ’s . Yet this old man wears these clothes with a certain unaccustomed air of being dressed and elaborated for the public ways ; as though he passed the greater part of his time in a nightcap and gown . And so , like the country mouse in the second year of a famine , come to see the town mouse , and timidly threading his way to the town - mouse ’s lodging through a city of cats , this old man passes in the streets . Sometimes , on holidays towards evening , he will be seen to walk with a slightly increased infirmity , and his old eyes will glimmer with a moist and marshy light . Then the little old man is drunk . A very small measure will overset him ; he may be bowled off his unsteady legs with a half - pint pot . Some pitying acquaintance -- chance acquaintance very often -- has warmed up his weakness with a treat of beer , and the consequence will be the lapse of a longer time than usual before he shall pass again . For the little old man is going home to the Workhouse ; and on his good behaviour they do not let him out often ( though methinks they might , considering the few years he has before him to go out in , under the sun ) ; and on his bad behaviour they shut him up closer than ever in a grove of two score and nineteen more old men , every one of whom smells of all the others . Mrs Plornish ’s father,--a poor little reedy piping old gentleman , like a worn - out bird ; who had been in what he called the music - binding business , and met with great misfortunes , and who had seldom been able to make his way , or to see it or to pay it , or to do anything at all with it but find it no thoroughfare,--had retired of his own accord to the Workhouse which was appointed by law to be the Good Samaritan of his district ( without the twopence , which was bad political economy ) , on the settlement of that execution which had carried Mr Plornish to the Marshalsea College . Previous to his son - in - law ’s difficulties coming to that head , Old Nandy ( he was always so called in his legal Retreat , but he was Old Mr Nandy among the Bleeding Hearts ) had sat in a corner of the Plornish fireside , and taken his bite and sup out of the Plornish cupboard . He still hoped to resume that domestic position when Fortune should smile upon his son - in - law ; in the meantime , while she preserved an immovable countenance , he was , and resolved to remain , one of these little old men in a grove of little old men with a community of flavour . But no poverty in him , and no coat on him that never was the mode , and no Old Men ’s Ward for his dwelling - place , could quench his daughter ’s admiration . Mrs Plornish was as proud of her father ’s talents as she could possibly have been if they had made him Lord Chancellor . She had as firm a belief in the sweetness and propriety of his manners as she could possibly have had if he had been Lord Chamberlain . The poor little old man knew some pale and vapid little songs , long out of date , about Chloe , and Phyllis , and Strephon being wounded by the son of Venus ; and for Mrs Plornish there was no such music at the Opera as the small internal flutterings and chirpings wherein he would discharge himself of these ditties , like a weak , little , broken barrel - organ , ground by a baby . On his ‘

183995	183999	184001	184002	Mr Plornish	358	‘ For why , ’
184004	184028	184001	184002	Mr Plornish	358	‘ why go a - binding music when you ’ve got it in yourself ? That ’s where it is , I consider . ’
184293	184321	184281	184281	he	353	‘ In the Workhouse , sir , the Union ; no privacy , no visitors , no station , no respect , no speciality . Most deplorable ! ’
184409	184413	184415	184416	Mrs Plornish	387	‘ Miss Dorrit , ’
184418	184436	184415	184416	Mrs Plornish	387	‘ here ’s Father ! Ai n’t he looking nice ? And such voice he ’s in ! ’

184530	184563	184528	184528	God	302	’ Here Mr Plornish delivered himself of an oration which he invariably made , word for word the same , on all such opportunities . It was couched in the following terms : ‘
184588	184615	184661	184661	I	0	’re fully welcome to your share on it . While there ’s a handful of fire or a mouthful of bed in this present roof , you ’re
184691	184726	184727	184727	I	0	’ To this lucid address , which Mr Plornish always delivered as if he had composed it ( as no doubt he had ) with enormous labour , Mrs Plornish ’s father pipingly replied : ‘
184811	184874	184807	184807	Thomas	365	’ Mrs Plornish , who had been turning her face a little away with a corner of her apron in her hand , brought herself back to the conversation again by telling Miss Dorrit that Father was going over the water to pay his respects , unless she knew of any reason why it might not be agreeable . Her answer was , ‘
184902	184916	184888	184888	I	0	’ said Little Dorrit , always thoughtful of the feelings of the weak , ‘

185193	185199	185188	185190	that young lady	5026	‘ You never mean it ! ’
185200	185207	185188	185190	that young lady	5026	‘ Mean what , Fanny dear ? ’
185208	185221	185223	185225	the young lady	1678	‘ Well ! I could have believed a great deal of you , ’
185230	185247	185223	185225	the young lady	1678	‘ but I do n’t think even I could have believed this , of even you ! ’

185260	185296	185253	185254	Little Dorrit	274	‘ Oh ! Do n’t Fanny me , you mean little thing , do n’t ! The idea of coming along the open streets , in the broad light of day , with a Pauper ! ’
185316	185320	185253	185254	Little Dorrit	274	‘ O Fanny ! ’
185321	185370	185223	185225	the young lady	1678	‘ I tell you not to Fanny me , for I ’ll not submit to it ! I never knew such a thing . The way in which you are resolved and determined to disgrace us on all occasions , is really infamous . You bad little thing ! ’
185371	185377	185379	185380	Little Dorrit	274	‘ Does it disgrace anybody , ’
185385	185395	185379	185380	Little Dorrit	274	‘ to take care of this poor old man ? ’
185396	185401	185403	185404	her sister	1027	‘ Yes , miss , ’
185406	185494	185403	185404	her sister	1027	‘ and you ought to know it does . And you do know it does , and you do it because you know it does . The principal pleasure of your life is to remind your family of their misfortunes . And the next great pleasure of your existence is to keep low company . But , however , if you have no sense of decency , I have . You ’ll please to allow me to go on the other side of the way , unmolested . ’
185563	185588	185554	185555	his companion	909	‘ I hope nothing ’s wrong with your honoured father , Miss ? I hope there ’s nothing the matter in the honoured family ? ’

185599	185621	185596	185597	Little Dorrit	274	‘ No , thank you . Give me your arm again , Mr Nandy . We shall soon be there now . ’

185860	185867	185869	185870	Little Dorrit	274	‘ What is it , father ? ’
185876	185891	185869	185870	Little Dorrit	274	‘ Have I made you unhappy , father ? Not I , I hope ! ’
185892	185923	185924	185924	He	875	‘ You hope , indeed ! I dare say ! Oh , you’--Fanny paused for a sufficiently strong expression--‘you Common - minded little Amy ! You complete prison - child ! ’

186057	186085	186055	186055	Fanny	342	‘ You know how it is . I have told you already , so do n’t fly in the face of Providence by attempting to deny it ! ’

186247	186313	186238	186238	he	875	‘ Humiliation I have happily been spared until this day . Through all my troubles there has been that -- Spirit in myself , and that -- that submission to it , if I may use the term , in those about me , which has spared me -- ha -- humiliation . But this day , this minute , I have keenly felt it . ’
186314	186324	186328	186328	Fanny	342	‘ Of course ! How could it be otherwise ? ’
186330	186339	186328	186328	Fanny	342	‘ Careering and prancing about with a Pauper ! ’
186347	186353	186355	186356	Little Dorrit	274	‘ But , dear father , ’
186358	186379	186380	186380	She	274	‘ I do n’t justify myself for having wounded your dear heart -- no ! Heaven knows I do n’t ! ’

But if I had not known that you were kind to the old man yourself , and took much notice of him , and were always glad to see him , I would not have come here with him , father , I would not , indeed . What I have been so unhappy as to do , I have done in mistake . I would not wilfully bring a tear to your eyes , dear love ! ’

186626	186753	186754	186754	he	5049	‘ I -- shall soon be able to dismiss it . It is perfectly true , my dear , that I am always glad to see my old pensioner -- as such , as such -- and that I do -- ha -- extend as much protection and kindness to the -- hum -- the bruised reed -- I trust I may so call him without impropriety -- as in my circumstances , I can . It is quite true that this is the case , my dear child . At the same time , I preserve in doing this , if I may -- ha -- if I may use the expression -- Spirit . Becoming Spirit .

It is not that I have seen my good Amy attentive , and -- ha -- condescending to my old pensioner -- it is not _ that _ that hurts me . It is , if I am to close the painful subject by being explicit , that I have seen my child , my own child , my own daughter , coming into this College out of the public streets -- smiling ! smiling!--arm in arm with -- O my God , a livery ! ’

I am quite myself again , my love , quite myself . Go to your room , Amy , and make yourself look comfortable and pleasant to receive Mr Clennam . ’

A little reserved at times ; but I will say extremely gentlemanly . I could n’t think of your not being here to receive Mr Clennam , my dear , especially this afternoon . So go and freshen yourself up , Amy ; go and freshen yourself up , like a good girl . ’

Why , then , to make it clearer to you , sir , I beg to let you know that when I address what I call a properly - worded appeal , and an urgent appeal , and a delicate appeal , to an individual , for a small temporary accommodation , easily within his power -- easily within his power , mind!--and when that individual writes back word to me that he begs to be excused , I consider that he does n’t treat me like a gentleman . ’

189609	189657	189607	189607	him	1435	‘ Now , do n’t ask me how I dare , father , because that ’s bosh . As to the fact of the line of conduct I choose to adopt towards the individual present , you ought to be proud of my showing a proper spirit . ’
189658	189664	189666	189666	Fanny	342	‘ I should think so ! ’
189668	189673	189675	189676	the Father	875	‘ A proper spirit ? ’
189678	189700	189675	189676	the Father	875	‘ Yes , a proper spirit ; a becoming spirit . Is it come to this that my son teaches me--_me_--spirit ! ’
189701	189749	189607	189607	him	1435	‘ Now , do n’t let us bother about it , father , or have any row on the subject . I have fully made up my mind that the individual present has not treated me like a gentleman . And there ’s an end of it . ’
189750	189762	189764	189765	the Father	875	‘ But there is not an end of it , sir , ’
189767	189792	189764	189765	the Father	875	‘ But there shall not be an end of it . You have made up your mind ? You have made up your mind ? ’
189793	189811	189607	189607	him	1435	‘ Yes , _ I _ have . What ’s the good of keeping on like that ? ’
189812	189815	189817	189818	the Father	290	‘ Because , ’
189825	189915	189817	189818	the Father	290	‘ you had no right to make up your mind to what is monstrous , to what is -- ha -- immoral , to what is -- hum -- parricidal . No , Mr Clennam , I beg , sir . Do n’t ask me to desist ; there is a -- hum -- a general principle involved here , which rises even above considerations of -- ha -- hospitality . I object to the assertion made by my son . I -- ha -- I personally repel it . ’
189916	189927	189929	189930	the son	9825	‘ Why , what is it to you , father ? ’
189936	189964	189965	189965	he	9825	‘ What is it to me , sir ? I have a -- hum -- a spirit , sir , that will not endure it . I , ’
189978	190102	189965	189965	he	9825	‘ I am outraged and insulted by it . Let me suppose the case that I myself may at a certain time -- ha -- or times , have made a -- hum -- an appeal , and a properly - worded appeal , and a delicate appeal , and an urgent appeal to some individual for a small temporary accommodation . Let me suppose that that accommodation could have been easily extended , and was not extended , and that that individual informed me that he begged to be excused . Am I to be told by my own son , that I therefore received treatment not due to a gentleman , and that I -- ha -- I submitted to it ? ’
190175	190196	190198	190200	the young gentleman	11791	‘ You are putting it on yourself , father , and getting into all this injury of your own accord ! ’
190203	190240	190198	190200	the young gentleman	11791	‘ What I have made up my mind about has nothing to do with you . What I said had nothing to do with you . Why need you go trying on other people ’s hats ? ’
190241	190252	190254	190255	the Father	875	‘ I reply it has everything to do with me , ’
190257	190401	190402	190402	He	5126	‘ I point out to you , sir , with indignation , that -- hum -- the -- ha -- delicacy and peculiarity of your father ’s position should strike you dumb , sir , if nothing else should , in laying down such -- ha -- such unnatural principles . Besides ; if you are not filial , sir , if you discard that duty , you are at least -- hum -- not a Christian ? Are you -- ha -- an Atheist ? And is it Christian , let me ask you , to stigmatise and denounce an individual for begging to be excused this time , when the same individual may -- ha -- respond with the required accommodation next time ? Is it the part of a Christian not to -- hum -- not to try him again ? ’
190414	190420	190422	190423	Mr Tip	344	‘ I see precious well , ’
190427	190500	190422	190423	Mr Tip	344	‘ that I shall get no sensible or fair argument here to - night , and so the best thing I can do is to cut . Good night , Amy . Do n’t be vexed . I am very sorry it happens here , and you here , upon my soul I am ; but I ca n’t altogether part with my spirit , even for your sake , old girl . ’
190673	190682	190684	190685	the Father	875	‘ Such , you see , Mr Clennam , ’
190687	190718	190684	190685	the Father	875	‘ are the incongruities of my position here . But a public duty ! No man , I am sure , would more readily recognise a public duty than yourself . ’
190728	190791	190792	190792	Clennam	304	‘ Amy , my dear , if you can persuade Mr Clennam to stay longer , I can leave the honours of our poor apology for an establishment with confidence in your hands , and perhaps you may do something towards erasing from Mr Clennam ’s mind the -- ha -- untoward and unpleasant circumstance which has occurred since tea - time . ’
190811	190816	190818	190819	the Father	875	‘ My dear sir , ’
190850	190856	190818	190819	the Father	875	‘ Heaven ever bless you ! ’
191232	191243	191220	191220	Clennam	304	‘ Dear Little Dorrit , let me lay it down . ’
191271	191283	191265	191265	he	304	‘ How seldom I have seen you lately , Little Dorrit ! ’
191284	191292	191304	191304	Clennam	304	‘ I have been busy , sir . ’
191293	191302	191304	191304	Clennam	304	‘ But I heard only to - day , ’
191306	191331	191304	191304	Clennam	304	‘ by mere accident , of your having been with those good people close by me . Why not come to me , then ? ’
191332	191360	191361	191361	He	304	‘ I -- I do n’t know . Or rather , I thought you might be busy too . You generally are now , are you not ? ’
191396	191406	191385	191385	he	304	‘ My child , your manner is so changed ! ’
191443	191449	191451	191451	Clennam	304	‘ My own Little Dorrit , ’
191490	191496	191497	191497	he	304	‘ I can not bear , ’
191501	191519	191497	191497	he	304	‘ to see you weep ; but I hope this is a relief to an overcharged heart . ’
191520	191531	191486	191486	he	304	‘ Yes it is , sir . Nothing but that . ’
191532	191623	191624	191624	She	274	‘ Well , well ! I feared you would think too much of what passed here just now . It is of no moment ; not the least . I am only unfortunate to have come in the way . Let it go by with these tears . It is not worth one of them . One of them ? Such an idle thing should be repeated , with my glad consent , fifty times a day , to save you a moment ’s heart - ache , Little Dorrit . ’
191640	191671	191636	191636	her	274	‘ You are so good ! But even if there was nothing else in it to be sorry for and ashamed of , it is such a bad return to you-- ’
191672	191675	191677	191677	Clennam	304	‘ Hush ! ’
191688	191740	191677	191677	Clennam	304	‘ Forgetfulness in you who remember so many and so much , would be new indeed . Shall I remind you that I am not , and that I never was , anything but the friend whom you agreed to trust ? No . You remember it , do n’t you ? ’
191741	191789	191798	191798	she	5157	‘ I try to do so , or I should have broken the promise just now , when my mistaken brother was here . You will consider his bringing - up in this place , and will not judge him hardly , poor fellow , I know ! ’
191820	191830	191798	191798	she	5157	‘ You have not been ill , Mr Clennam ? ’
191831	191834	191798	191798	she	5157	‘ No . ’
191835	191842	191843	191843	she	5157	‘ Nor tried ? Nor hurt ? ’
191869	191925	191864	191864	He	5158	‘ To speak the truth , I have been a little troubled , but it is over . Do I show it so plainly ? I ought to have more fortitude and self - command than that . I thought I had . I must learn them of you . Who could teach me better ! ’
191967	191980	191981	191981	he	5158	‘ But it brings me to something that I wish to say , ’
191984	192085	191981	191981	he	5158	‘ and therefore I will not quarrel even with my own face for telling tales and being unfaithful to me . Besides , it is a privilege and pleasure to confide in my Little Dorrit . Let me confess then , that , forgetting how grave I was , and how old I was , and how the time for such things had gone by me with the many years of sameness and little happiness that made up my long life far away , without marking it -- that , forgetting all this , I fancied I loved some one . ’
192086	192094	192096	192097	Little Dorrit	274	‘ Do I know her , sir ? ’
192099	192105	192096	192097	Little Dorrit	274	‘ No , my child . ’
192106	192120	191981	191981	he	5158	‘ Not the lady who has been kind to me for your sake ? ’
192121	192131	192146	192146	herself	274	‘ Flora . No , no . Do you think-- ’
192132	192139	192141	192142	Little Dorrit	274	‘ I never quite thought so , ’
192150	192159	192141	192142	Little Dorrit	274	‘ I did wonder at it a little . ’
192160	192163	192165	192165	Clennam	304	‘ Well ! ’
192205	192285	192287	192287	he	5161	‘ I found out my mistake , and I thought about it a little -- in short , a good deal -- and got wiser . Being wiser , I counted up my years and considered what I am , and looked back , and looked forward , and found that I should soon be grey . I found that I had climbed the hill , and passed the level ground upon the top , and was descending quickly . ’
192320	192365	192287	192287	he	5161	‘ I found that the day when any such thing would have been graceful in me , or good in me , or hopeful or happy for me or any one in connection with me , was gone , and would never shine again . ’
192405	192474	192527	192527	her	5165	‘ All that is over , and I have turned my face from it . Why do I speak of this to Little Dorrit ? Why do I show you , my child , the space of years that there is between us , and recall to you that I have passed , by the amount of your whole life , the time that is present to you ? ’
192475	192521	192527	192527	her	5165	‘ Because you trust me , I hope . Because you know that nothing can touch you without touching me ; that nothing can make you happy or unhappy , but it must make me , who am so grateful to you , the same . ’
192571	192576	192538	192538	her	5165	‘ I love him ! ’
192640	192717	192739	192740	Little Dorrit	274	‘ For those reasons assuredly , Little Dorrit , but for another too . So far removed , so different , and so much older , I am the better fitted for your friend and adviser . I mean , I am the more easily to be trusted ; and any little constraint that you might feel with another , may vanish before me . Why have you kept so retired from me ? Tell me . ’
192718	192737	192739	192740	Little Dorrit	274	‘ I am better here . My place and use are here . I am much better here , ’
192744	192780	192739	192740	Little Dorrit	274	‘ So you said that day upon the bridge . I thought of it much afterwards . Have you no secret you could entrust to me , with hope and comfort , if you would ! ’
192781	192791	192793	192794	Little Dorrit	274	‘ Secret ? No , I have no secret , ’
192847	192854	192838	192838	Maggy	358	‘ I say ! Little Mother ! ’
192855	192860	192838	192838	Maggy	358	‘ Yes , Maggy . ’
192861	192892	192838	192838	Maggy	358	‘ If you an’t got no secret of your own to tell him , tell him that about the Princess . _ She _ had a secret , you know . ’
192893	192900	192902	192902	Clennam	304	‘ The Princess had a secret ? ’
192908	192916	192902	192902	Clennam	304	‘ What Princess was that , Maggy ? ’
192917	192931	192933	192933	Maggy	358	‘ Lor ! How you do go and bother a gal of ten , ’
192935	192960	192933	192933	Maggy	358	‘ catching the poor thing up in that way . Whoever said the Princess had a secret ? _ I _ never said so . ’
192961	192972	192838	192838	Maggy	358	‘ I beg your pardon . I thought you did . ’
192973	193107	193109	193109	Maggy	358	‘ No , I did n’t . How could I , when it was her as wanted to find it out ? It was the little woman as had the secret , and she was always a spinning at her wheel . And so she says to her , why do you keep it there ? And so the t’other one says to her , no I do n’t ; and so the t’other one says to her , yes you do ; and then they both goes to the cupboard , and there it is . And she would n’t go into the Hospital , and so she died . _ You _ know , Little Mother ; tell him that . For it was a reg’lar good secret , that was ! ’
193272	193276	193277	193277	he	304	‘ Little Dorrit , ’
193307	193468	193277	193277	he	304	‘ another word . I have wanted very much to say this to you ; I have tried for opportunities . Do n’t mind me , who , for the matter of years , might be your father or your uncle . Always think of me as quite an old man . I know that all your devotion centres in this room , and that nothing to the last will ever tempt you away from the duties you discharge here . If I were not sure of it , I should , before now , have implored you , and implored your father , to let me make some provision for you in a more suitable place . But you may have an interest -- I will not say , now , though even that might be -- may have , at another time , an interest in some one else ; an interest not incompatible with your affection here . ’
193482	193491	193479	193479	her	5173	‘ It may be , dear Little Dorrit . ’
193492	193499	193500	193500	She	5173	‘ No . No . No . ’
193547	193617	193529	193529	he	5174	‘ But , if it ever should be , tell me so , my dear child . Entrust the truth to me , point out the object of such an interest to me , and I will try with all the zeal , and honour , and friendship and respect that I feel for you , good Little Dorrit of my heart , to do you a lasting service . ’
193618	193637	193638	193638	She	5173	‘ O thank you , thank you ! But , O no , O no , O no ! ’
193663	193682	193646	193646	her	5173	‘ I press for no confidence now . I only ask you to repose unhesitating trust in me . ’
193683	193697	193529	193529	he	5174	‘ Can I do less than that , when you are so good ! ’
193698	193719	193529	193529	he	5174	‘ Then you will trust me fully ? Will have no secret unhappiness , or anxiety , concealed from me ? ’
193720	193724	193646	193646	her	5173	‘ Almost none . ’
193725	193732	193733	193733	She	5173	‘ And you have none now ? ’
193744	193809	193810	193810	She	5173	‘ When I lie down to - night , and my thoughts come back -- as they will , for they do every night , even when I have not seen you -- to this sad place , I may believe that there is no grief beyond this room , now , and its usual occupants , which preys on Little Dorrit ’s mind ? ’
193833	193844	193810	193810	She	5173	‘ Yes , Mr Clennam ; yes , you may ! ’
194003	194008	194009	194009	he	396	‘ Pancks the gipsy , ’

194283	194318	194281	194281	Pancks	396	‘ I thought you would n’t mind my running round , and looking in for a moment . Mr Clennam I heard was here , from Mr Dorrit . How are you , Sir ? ’
194334	194337	194339	194339	Pancks	396	‘ Gay ! ’

194517	194522	194524	194524	Pancks.--‘Eh	554	‘ Capital company here , ’
194529	194552	194524	194524	Pancks.--‘Eh	554	’ She was half afraid of him , and irresolute what to say . He laughed , with a nod towards Clennam . ‘
194609	194639	194640	194640	I	0	’ The excitement of this strange creature was fast communicating itself to Clennam . Little Dorrit with amazement , saw this , and observed that they exchanged quick looks . ‘

Quart of double stout a head . Pint of wine too , if they like it , and the authorities give permission.--Eh , Miss Dorrit ? ’
194858	194868	194870	194870	Pancks	396	‘ And oh , by - the - bye ! ’
194872	194904	194870	194870	Pancks	396	‘ you were to live to know what was behind us on that little hand of yours . And so you shall , you shall , my darling.--Eh , Miss Dorrit ? ’

195091	195103	195108	195108	sir	933	’ Arthur demanded , when they burst out there both together . ‘

195192	195196	195189	195190	Mr Rugg	506	’ said Pancks . ‘
195206	195262	195263	195263	I	0	’ They adjourned to the pump . Mr Pancks , instantly putting his head under the spout , requested Mr Rugg to take a good strong turn at the handle . Mr Rugg complying to the letter , Mr Pancks came forth snorting and blowing to some purpose , and dried himself on his handkerchief . ‘

195335	195427	195325	195326	Mr Rugg	506	’ Then and there , on that Marshalsea pavement , in the shades of evening , did Mr Pancks , of all mankind , fly over the head and shoulders of Mr Rugg of Pentonville , General Agent , Accountant , and Recoverer of Debts . Alighting on his feet , he took Clennam by the button - hole , led him behind the pump , and pantingly produced from his pocket a bundle of papers . Mr Rugg , also , pantingly produced from his pocket a bundle of papers . ‘

195539	195683	195522	195522	Pancks	396	‘ Where ’s the Pedigree ? Where ’s Schedule number four , Mr Rugg ? Oh ! all right ! Here we are.--You are to understand that we are this very day virtually complete . We sha n’t be legally for a day or two . Call it at the outside a week . We ’ve been at it night and day for I do n’t know how long . Mr Rugg , you know how long ? Never mind . Do n’t say . You ’ll only confuse me . You shall tell her , Mr Clennam . Not till we give you leave . Where ’s that rough total , Mr Rugg ? Oh ! Here we are ! There sir ! That ’s what you ’ll have to break to her . That man ’s your Father of the Marshalsea ! ’
196188	196204	196182	196182	she	464	‘ My dear , what have you done to Henry that has bewitched him so ! ’
196590	196595	196597	196598	Mrs Gowan	576	‘ My dear soul , ’
196617	196663	196597	196598	Mrs Gowan	576	‘ you are my only comfort . That affair of Henry ’s that I told you of , is to take place . Now , how does it strike you ? I am dying to know , because you represent and express Society so well . ’
196691	196700	196664	196665	Mrs Merdle	464	’ to be in good order , replied : ‘
196766	196805	196761	196761	Bird	467	’ For the parrot on his cage above them , presiding over the conference as if he were a judge ( and indeed he looked rather like one ) , had wound up the exposition with a shriek . ‘
196810	196835	196761	196761	Bird	467	’ said Mrs Merdle , delicately crooking the little finger of her favourite hand , and making her remarks neater by that neat action ; ‘
196869	196896	196899	196900	a man	10142	’ Mrs Merdle shrugged her snowy shoulders and put her hand upon the jewel - stand , checking a little cough , as though to add , ‘
196912	196933	196934	196934	Bird	467	’ Then the parrot shrieked again , and she put up her glass to look at him , and said , ‘
196940	196941	196934	196934	Bird	467	’ ‘
196947	196952	196944	196945	young men	11695	’ resumed Mrs Merdle , ‘
197012	197029	196992	196992	Society	10929	’ said Mrs Merdle , leaning back in her nest and putting up her glass again , ‘

197041	197052	197053	197053	My	0	’ said Mrs Gowan , with a highly moral air . ‘
197066	197071	197053	197053	My	0	’ returned Mrs Merdle ; ‘
197176	197198	197199	197199	My	0	’ Mrs Gowan , looking over her green fan when this young gentleman ’s name was mentioned , replied as follows : ‘
197230	197231	197232	197234	A church mouse	5270	’ ‘
197236	197244	197245	197245	I	0	’ Mrs Merdle suggested with a smile . ‘
197257	197262	197249	197253	the other proverbial church person	5271	’ said Mrs Gowan . ‘

197309	197319	197304	197304	Edmund	557	’ said Mrs Merdle , with the greatest suavity . ‘
197329	197335	197322	197322	his	272	’ Mrs Gowan went on , ‘
197379	197445	197446	197446	Ye	11570	’ Mrs Merdle was so much engaged with the contemplation of her arms ( beautiful - formed arms , and the very thing for bracelets ) , that she omitted to reply for a while . Roused at length by the silence , she folded the arms , and with admirable presence of mind looked her friend full in the face , and said interrogatively , ‘
197453	197454	197446	197446	Ye	11570	’ ‘
197461	197472	197446	197446	Ye	11570	’ said Mrs Gowan not quite so sweetly as before , ‘
197487	197549	197480	197480	you	969	’ Here the parrot , who had been standing on one leg since he screamed last , burst into a fit of laughter , bobbed himself derisively up and down on both legs , and finished by standing on one leg again , and pausing for a reply , with his head as much awry as he could possibly twist it . ‘
197564	197569	197480	197480	you	969	’ said Mrs Merdle ; ‘
197584	197585	197574	197576	a little mercenary	5278	’ ‘
197593	197598	197574	197576	a little mercenary	5278	’ said Mrs Gowan , ‘

197617	197625	197601	197601	I	0	’ asked Mrs Merdle through her eyeglass . ‘

197650	197661	197644	197644	I	0	’ Mrs Merdle observed in a comfortable sort of way . ‘
197688	197689	197664	197665	the father	875	’ ‘
197696	197701	197664	197665	the father	875	’ said Mrs Merdle . ‘
197723	197745	197664	197665	the father	875	’ True . Mrs Merdle hastened to spare the feelings of her afflicted friend . She understood . Say no more ! ‘
197749	197759	197664	197665	the father	875	’ said Mrs Gowan , shaking her despondent head , ‘
197766	197809	197664	197665	the father	875	’ repeated Mrs Gowan , furling her green fan for the moment , and tapping her chin with it ( it was on the way to being a double chin ; might be called a chin and a half at present ) , ‘
197871	197995	197860	197860	they	5283	’ Now , Mrs Merdle , who really knew her friend Society pretty well , and who knew what Society ’s mothers were , and what Society ’s daughters were , and what Society ’s matrimonial market was , and how prices ruled in it , and what scheming and counter - scheming took place for the high buyers , and what bargaining and huckstering went on , thought in the depths of her capacious bosom that this was a sufficiently good catch . Knowing , however , what was expected of her , and perceiving the exact nature of the fiction to be nursed , she took it delicately in her arms , and put her required contribution of gloss upon it . ‘
198004	198013	197860	197860	they	5283	’ said she , heaving a friendly sigh . ‘
198052	198053	198054	198055	The girl	9864	’ ‘
198061	198066	198054	198055	The girl	9864	’ said Mrs Gowan , ‘
198088	198089	198092	198092	they	5288	’ ‘
198098	198103	198092	198092	they	5288	’ said Mrs Merdle . ‘
198132	198133	198136	198136	you	969	’ ‘
198142	198147	198136	198136	you	969	’ said Mrs Merdle . ‘
198198	198539	198192	198192	I	0	’ In answer to this direct appeal , Mrs Merdle assured Mrs Gowan ( speaking as a Priestess of Society ) that she was highly to be commended , that she was much to be sympathised with , that she had taken the highest of parts , and had come out of the furnace refined . And Mrs Gowan , who of course saw through her own threadbare blind perfectly , and who knew that Mrs Merdle saw through it perfectly , and who knew that Society would see through it perfectly , came out of this form , notwithstanding , as she had gone into it , with immense complacency and gravity . The conference was held at four or five o’clock in the afternoon , when all the region of Harley Street , Cavendish Square , was resonant of carriage - wheels and double - knocks . It had reached this point when Mr Merdle came home from his daily occupation of causing the British name to be more and more respected in all parts of the civilised globe capable of the appreciation of world - wide commercial enterprise and gigantic combinations of skill and capital . For , though nobody knew with the least precision what Mr Merdle ’s business was , except that it was to coin money , these were the terms in which everybody defined it on all ceremonious occasions , and which it was the last new polite reading of the parable of the camel and the needle ’s eye to accept without inquiry . For a gentleman who had this splendid work cut out for him , Mr Merdle looked a little common , and rather as if , in the course of his vast transactions , he had accidentally made an interchange of heads with some inferior spirit . He presented himself before the two ladies in the course of a dismal stroll through his mansion , which had no apparent object but escape from the presence of the chief butler . ‘
198545	198554	198540	198540	I	0	’ he said , stopping short in confusion ; ‘
198567	198575	198561	198565	anybody here but the parrot	5295	’ However , as Mrs Merdle said , ‘
198581	198675	198576	198576	You	0	’ and as Mrs Gowan said she was just going , and had already risen to take her leave , he came in , and stood looking out at a distant window , with his hands crossed under his uneasy coat - cuffs , clasping his wrists as if he were taking himself into custody . In this attitude he fell directly into a reverie from which he was only aroused by his wife ’s calling to him from her ottoman , when they had been for some quarter of an hour alone . ‘
198680	198689	198576	198576	You	0	’ said Mr Merdle , turning towards her . ‘
198694	198695	198576	198576	You	0	’ ‘
198700	198705	198576	198576	You	0	’ repeated Mrs Merdle . ‘

198799	198862	198863	198863	You	0	’ In his withdrawing , abstracted , pondering way , it took him some time to shape this question . As a kind of faint attempt to convince himself that he was the master of the house , he concluded by presenting his forefinger to the parrot , who expressed his opinion on that subject by instantly driving his bill into it . ‘
198870	198883	198863	198863	You	0	’ said Mr Merdle , with his wounded finger in his mouth , ‘
198892	198893	198885	198885	you	0	’ ‘

198965	198974	198959	198960	Mrs Merdle	464	’ said Mr Merdle , taking a chair . ‘

199035	199042	199032	199033	Mrs Merdle	464	’ said Mr Merdle , heavily . ‘

199106	199141	199153	199154	Mrs Merdle	464	’ Mr Merdle , so twisting his hands into what hair he had upon his head that he seemed to lift himself up by it as he started out of his chair , cried : ‘
199274	199275	199283	199284	Mr Merdle	273	’ ‘
199286	199291	199283	199284	Mr Merdle	273	’ said Mrs Merdle . ‘

199403	199416	199400	199401	Mrs Merdle	464	’ retorted that gentleman , wiping his dull red and yellow face , ‘
199511	199529	199505	199505	I	0	’ repeated Mr Merdle , with a wild emphasis that made his wife lift up her eyelids , ‘

199557	199563	199554	199554	I	0	’ answered Mrs Merdle composedly , ‘

199611	199616	199608	199609	Mrs Merdle	464	’ asked Mr Merdle . ‘

199637	199680	199632	199632	yourself	464	’ Mr Merdle involuntarily turned his eyes in the direction of the nearest mirror , and asked , with a slow determination of his turbid blood to his temples , whether a man was to be called to account for his digestion ? ‘
199686	199691	199683	199684	a physician	5310	’ said Mrs Merdle . ‘
199698	199709	199692	199692	He	5310	’ said Mr Merdle . Mrs Merdle changed her ground . ‘

199771	199782	199754	199754	You	464	’ said Mrs Merdle , reposing easily among her cushions , ‘

199838	199843	199830	199830	I	0	’ asked Mr Merdle . ‘

199872	199878	199879	199879	I	0	’ demanded Mr Merdle hurriedly . ‘

199966	199977	199963	199964	A carpenter	5316	’ repeated Mr Merdle , checking something like a groan . ‘
199991	199992	199988	199989	Mrs Merdle	464	’ ‘
199998	200008	199994	199994	my	0	’ pursued the lady , disregarding the low remark , ‘
200043	200066	200067	200067	Edmund	557	’ The door of the room had opened , and Mrs Merdle now surveyed the head of her son through her glass . ‘
200074	200171	200173	200173	he	557	’ Mr Sparkler , who had merely put in his head and looked round the room without entering ( as if he were searching the house for that young lady with no nonsense about her ) , upon this followed up his head with his body , and stood before them . To whom , in a few easy words adapted to his capacity , Mrs Merdle stated the question at issue . The young gentleman , after anxiously feeling his shirt - collar as if it were his pulse and he were hypochondriacal , observed , ‘
200181	200182	200173	200173	he	557	’ ‘
200190	200199	200183	200184	Edmund Sparkler	557	’ said Mrs Merdle , with languid triumph . ‘
200210	200250	200183	200184	Edmund Sparkler	557	’ Which in truth was no unreasonable inference ; seeing that Mr Sparkler would probably be the last person , in any assemblage of the human species , to receive an impression from anything that passed in his presence . ‘
200262	200275	200277	200277	he	557	’ said Mrs Merdle , waving her favourite hand towards her husband , ‘
200283	200284	200277	200277	he	557	’ ‘
200289	200301	200285	200285	I	0	’ said Mr Sparkler , after feeling his pulse as before , ‘

200353	200362	200350	200351	the sister	10313	’ remarked Mrs Merdle , a little impatiently . ‘
200369	200370	200365	200366	the brother	10553	’ ‘
200379	200384	200377	200377	ma’am	10131	’ answered Mr Sparkler . ‘

200405	200410	200401	200401	Somebody	1463	’ returned Mrs Merdle . ‘
200417	200419	200401	200401	Somebody	1463	’ [ ‘
200429	200435	200422	200422	I	0	’ said Mr Sparkler . ) ‘
200443	200464	200465	200465	Fellers	5320	’ Mr Sparkler referred to his pulse again , and put himself through some severe mental discipline before he replied : ‘
200530	200531	200511	200511	he	5333	’ ‘
200534	200548	200511	200511	he	5333	’ said Mrs Merdle , rising , with her floating drapery about her , ‘
200564	201285	200554	200554	Edmund	557	’ Mr Merdle , left alone to meditate on a better conformation of himself to Society , looked out of nine windows in succession , and appeared to see nine wastes of space . When he had thus entertained himself he went down - stairs , and looked intently at all the carpets on the ground - floor ; and then came up - stairs again , and looked intently at all the carpets on the first - floor ; as if they were gloomy depths , in unison with his oppressed soul . Through all the rooms he wandered , as he always did , like the last person on earth who had any business to approach them . Let Mrs Merdle announce , with all her might , that she was at Home ever so many nights in a season , she could not announce more widely and unmistakably than Mr Merdle did that he was never at home . At last he met the chief butler , the sight of which splendid retainer always finished him . Extinguished by this great creature , he sneaked to his dressing - room , and there remained shut up until he rode out to dinner , with Mrs Merdle , in her own handsome chariot . At dinner , he was envied and flattered as a being of might , was Treasuried , Barred , and Bishoped , as much as he would ; and an hour after midnight came home alone , and being instantly put out again in his own hall , like a rushlight , by the chief butler , went sighing to bed . CHAPTER 34 . A Shoal of Barnacles Mr Henry Gowan and the dog were established frequenters of the cottage , and the day was fixed for the wedding . There was to be a convocation of Barnacles on the occasion , in order that that very high and very large family might shed as much lustre on the marriage as so dim an event was capable of receiving . To have got the whole Barnacle family together would have been impossible for two reasons . Firstly , because no building could have held all the members and connections of that illustrious house . Secondly , because wherever there was a square yard of ground in British occupation under the sun or moon , with a public post upon it , sticking to that post was a Barnacle . No intrepid navigator could plant a flag - staff upon any spot of earth , and take possession of it in the British name , but to that spot of earth , so soon as the discovery was known , the Circumlocution Office sent out a Barnacle and a despatch - box . Thus the Barnacles were all over the world , in every direction -- despatch - boxing the compass . But , while the so - potent art of Prospero himself would have failed in summoning the Barnacles from every speck of ocean and dry land on which there was nothing ( except mischief ) to be done and anything to be pocketed , it was perfectly feasible to assemble a good many Barnacles . This Mrs Gowan applied herself to do ; calling on Mr Meagles frequently with new additions to the list , and holding conferences with that gentleman when he was not engaged ( as he generally was at this period ) in examining and paying the debts of his future son - in - law , in the apartment of scales and scoop . One marriage guest there was , in reference to whose presence Mr Meagles felt a nearer interest and concern than in the attendance of the most elevated Barnacle expected ; though he was far from insensible of the honour of having such company . This guest was Clennam . But Clennam had made a promise he held sacred , among the trees that summer night , and , in the chivalry of his heart , regarded it as binding him to many implied obligations . In forgetfulness of himself , and delicate service to her on all occasions , he was never to fail ; to begin it , he answered Mr Meagles cheerfully , ‘
201293	201391	201286	201286	I	0	’ His partner , Daniel Doyce , was something of a stumbling - block in Mr Meagles ’s way , the worthy gentleman being not at all clear in his own anxious mind but that the mingling of Daniel with official Barnacleism might produce some explosive combination , even at a marriage breakfast . The national offender , however , lightened him of his uneasiness by coming down to Twickenham to represent that he begged , with the freedom of an old friend , and as a favour to one , that he might not be invited . ‘
201394	201398	201286	201286	I	0	’ said he , ‘
201453	201482	201562	201562	You	5342	’ Mr Meagles was much amused by his friend ’s oddity ; and patronised him with a more protecting air of allowance than usual , when he rejoined : ‘
201497	201561	201492	201492	your	374	’ To Mr Henry Gowan , as the time approached , Clennam tried to convey by all quiet and unpretending means , that he was frankly and disinterestedly desirous of tendering him any friendship he would accept . Mr Gowan treated him in return with his usual ease , and with his usual show of confidence , which was no confidence at all . ‘
201567	201594	201492	201492	your	374	’ he happened to remark in the course of conversation one day , when they were walking near the Cottage within a week of the marriage , ‘
201606	201607	201597	201599	a disappointed man	5343	’ ‘
201612	201620	201597	201599	a disappointed man	5343	’ said Clennam , a little embarrassed , ‘
201626	201627	201597	201599	a disappointed man	5343	’ ‘
201630	201634	201597	201599	a disappointed man	5343	’ returned Gowan , ‘
201700	201705	201693	201698	a poor devil of an artist	5347	’ Clennam was beginning , ‘
201711	201718	201693	201698	a poor devil of an artist	5347	’ when Gowan took him up . ‘
201748	201750	201735	201746	a beautiful and charming girl whom I love with all my heart	5348	’ [ ‘
201757	201773	201735	201746	a beautiful and charming girl whom I love with all my heart	5348	’ Clennam thought . And as he thought it , felt ashamed of himself . ) ‘
201849	201910	201915	201915	I	0	’ Clennam thought ( and as he thought it , again felt ashamed of himself ) , was this notion of being disappointed in life , an assertion of station which the bridegroom brought into the family as his property , having already carried it detrimentally into his pursuit ? And was it a hopeful or a promising thing anywhere ? ‘
201918	201923	201915	201915	I	0	’ he said aloud . ‘
201932	201936	201915	201915	I	0	’ laughed Gowan . ‘
202019	202020	202015	202015	I	0	’ ‘
202028	202032	202015	202015	I	0	’ said Arthur . ‘

202101	202105	202050	202050	Jove	518	’ said Clennam . ‘
202109	202115	202116	202116	we	5361	’ added Gowan , laughing ; ‘

202369	202386	202388	202390	a capital fellow	5350	’ exclaimed the other , stopping to look at him , as if with irrepressible admiration . ‘
202406	202450	202451	202451	Clennam	304	’ It would have been so cruel if he had meant it , that Clennam firmly resolved to believe he did not mean it . Gowan , without pausing , laid his hand upon his shoulder , and laughingly and lightly went on : ‘
202579	203080	202574	202574	You	304	’ Whatever he had heard , and whether it deserved that name or another , it sank into Clennam ’s mind . It so took root there , that he began to fear Henry Gowan would always be a trouble to him , and that so far he had gained little or nothing from the dismissal of Nobody , with all his inconsistencies , anxieties , and contradictions . He found a contest still always going on in his breast between his promise to keep Gowan in none but good aspects before the mind of Mr Meagles , and his enforced observation of Gowan in aspects that had no good in them . Nor could he quite support his own conscientious nature against misgivings that he distorted and discoloured himself , by reminding himself that he never sought those discoveries , and that he would have avoided them with willingness and great relief . For he never could forget what he had been ; and he knew that he had once disliked Gowan for no better reason than that he had come in his way . Harassed by these thoughts , he now began to wish the marriage over , Gowan and his young wife gone , and himself left to fulfil his promise , and discharge the generous function he had accepted . This last week was , in truth , an uneasy interval for the whole house . Before Pet , or before Gowan , Mr Meagles was radiant ; but Clennam had more than once found him alone , with his view of the scales and scoop much blurred , and had often seen him look after the lovers , in the garden or elsewhere when he was not seen by them , with the old clouded face on which Gowan had fallen like a shadow . In the arrangement of the house for the great occasion , many little reminders of the old travels of the father and mother and daughter had to be disturbed and passed from hand to hand ; and sometimes , in the midst of these mute witnesses , to the life they had had together , even Pet herself would yield to lamenting and weeping . Mrs Meagles , the blithest and busiest of mothers , went about singing and cheering everybody ; but she , honest soul , had her flights into store rooms , where she would cry until her eyes were red , and would then come out , attributing that appearance to pickled onions and pepper , and singing clearer than ever . Mrs Tickit , finding no balsam for a wounded mind in Buchan ’s Domestic Medicine , suffered greatly from low spirits , and from moving recollections of Minnie ’s infancy . When the latter was powerful with her , she usually sent up secret messages importing that she was not in parlour condition as to her attire , and that she solicited a sight of ‘
203083	203408	202574	202574	You	304	’ in the kitchen ; there , she would bless her child ’s face , and bless her child ’s heart , and hug her child , in a medley of tears and congratulations , chopping - boards , rolling - pins , and pie - crust , with the tenderness of an old attached servant , which is a very pretty tenderness indeed . But all days come that are to be ; and the marriage - day was to be , and it came ; and with it came all the Barnacles who were bidden to the feast . There was Mr Tite Barnacle , from the Circumlocution Office , and Mews Street , Grosvenor Square , with the expensive Mrs Tite Barnacle _ nee _ Stiltstalking , who made the Quarter Days so long in coming , and the three expensive Miss Tite Barnacles , double - loaded with accomplishments and ready to go off , and yet not going off with the sharpness of flash and bang that might have been expected , but rather hanging fire . There was Barnacle junior , also from the Circumlocution Office , leaving the Tonnage of the country , which he was somehow supposed to take under his protection , to look after itself , and , sooth to say , not at all impairing the efficiency of its protection by leaving it alone . There was the engaging Young Barnacle , deriving from the sprightly side of the family , also from the Circumlocution Office , gaily and agreeably helping the occasion along , and treating it , in his sparkling way , as one of the official forms and fees of the Church Department of How not to do it . There were three other Young Barnacles from three other offices , insipid to all the senses , and terribly in want of seasoning , doing the marriage as they would have ‘
203410	203835	202574	202574	You	304	’ the Nile , Old Rome , the new singer , or Jerusalem . But there was greater game than this . There was Lord Decimus Tite Barnacle himself , in the odour of Circumlocution -- with the very smell of Despatch - Boxes upon him . Yes , there was Lord Decimus Tite Barnacle , who had risen to official heights on the wings of one indignant idea , and that was , My Lords , that I am yet to be told that it behoves a Minister of this free country to set bounds to the philanthropy , to cramp the charity , to fetter the public spirit , to contract the enterprise , to damp the independent self - reliance , of its people . That was , in other words , that this great statesman was always yet to be told that it behoved the Pilot of the ship to do anything but prosper in the private loaf and fish trade ashore , the crew being able , by dint of hard pumping , to keep the ship above water without him . On this sublime discovery in the great art How not to do it , Lord Decimus had long sustained the highest glory of the Barnacle family ; and let any ill - advised member of either House but try How to do it by bringing in a Bill to do it , that Bill was as good as dead and buried when Lord Decimus Tite Barnacle rose up in his place and solemnly said , soaring into indignant majesty as the Circumlocution cheering soared around him , that he was yet to be told , My Lords , that it behoved him as the Minister of this free country , to set bounds to the philanthropy , to cramp the charity , to fetter the public spirit , to contract the enterprise , to damp the independent self - reliance , of its people . The discovery of this Behoving Machine was the discovery of the political perpetual motion . It never wore out , though it was always going round and round in all the State Departments . And there , with his noble friend and relative Lord Decimus , was William Barnacle , who had made the ever - famous coalition with Tudor Stiltstalking , and who always kept ready his own particular recipe for How not to do it ; sometimes tapping the Speaker , and drawing it fresh out of him , with a ‘
203865	205242	203858	203860	the honourable gentleman	2100	’ sometimes asking the honourable gentleman to favour him with his own version of the Precedent ; sometimes telling the honourable gentleman that he ( William Barnacle ) would search for a Precedent ; and oftentimes crushing the honourable gentleman flat on the spot by telling him there was no Precedent . But Precedent and Precipitate were , under all circumstances , the well - matched pair of battle - horses of this able Circumlocutionist . No matter that the unhappy honourable gentleman had been trying in vain , for twenty - five years , to precipitate William Barnacle into this -- William Barnacle still put it to the House , and ( at second - hand or so ) to the country , whether he was to be precipitated into this . No matter that it was utterly irreconcilable with the nature of things and course of events that the wretched honourable gentleman could possibly produce a Precedent for this -- William Barnacle would nevertheless thank the honourable gentleman for that ironical cheer , and would close with him upon that issue , and would tell him to his teeth that there Was NO Precedent for this . It might perhaps have been objected that the William Barnacle wisdom was not high wisdom or the earth it bamboozled would never have been made , or , if made in a rash mistake , would have remained blank mud . But Precedent and Precipitate together frightened all objection out of most people . And there , too , was another Barnacle , a lively one , who had leaped through twenty places in quick succession , and was always in two or three at once , and who was the much - respected inventor of an art which he practised with great success and admiration in all Barnacle Governments . This was , when he was asked a Parliamentary question on any one topic , to return an answer on any other . It had done immense service , and brought him into high esteem with the Circumlocution Office . And there , too , was a sprinkling of less distinguished Parliamentary Barnacles , who had not as yet got anything snug , and were going through their probation to prove their worthiness . These Barnacles perched upon staircases and hid in passages , waiting their orders to make houses or not to make houses ; and they did all their hearing , and ohing , and cheering , and barking , under directions from the heads of the family ; and they put dummy motions on the paper in the way of other men ’s motions ; and they stalled disagreeable subjects off until late in the night and late in the session , and then with virtuous patriotism cried out that it was too late ; and they went down into the country , whenever they were sent , and swore that Lord Decimus had revived trade from a swoon , and commerce from a fit , and had doubled the harvest of corn , quadrupled the harvest of hay , and prevented no end of gold from flying out of the Bank . Also these Barnacles were dealt , by the heads of the family , like so many cards below the court - cards , to public meetings and dinners ; where they bore testimony to all sorts of services on the part of their noble and honourable relatives , and buttered the Barnacles on all sorts of toasts . And they stood , under similar orders , at all sorts of elections ; and they turned out of their own seats , on the shortest notice and the most unreasonable terms , to let in other men ; and they fetched and carried , and toadied and jobbed , and corrupted , and ate heaps of dirt , and were indefatigable in the public service . And there was not a list , in all the Circumlocution Office , of places that might fall vacant anywhere within half a century , from a lord of the Treasury to a Chinese consul , and up again to a governor - general of India , but as applicants for such places , the names of some or of every one of these hungry and adhesive Barnacles were down . It was necessarily but a sprinkling of any class of Barnacles that attended the marriage , for there were not two score in all , and what is that subtracted from Legion ! But the sprinkling was a swarm in the Twickenham cottage , and filled it . A Barnacle ( assisted by a Barnacle ) married the happy pair , and it behoved Lord Decimus Tite Barnacle himself to conduct Mrs Meagles to breakfast . The entertainment was not as agreeable and natural as it might have been . Mr Meagles , hove down by his good company while he highly appreciated it , was not himself . Mrs Gowan was herself , and that did not improve him . The fiction that it was not Mr Meagles who had stood in the way , but that it was the Family greatness , and that the Family greatness had made a concession , and there was now a soothing unanimity , pervaded the affair , though it was never openly expressed . Then the Barnacles felt that they for their parts would have done with the Meagleses when the present patronising occasion was over ; and the Meagleses felt the same for their parts . Then Gowan asserting his rights as a disappointed man who had his grudge against the family , and who , perhaps , had allowed his mother to have them there , as much in the hope it might give them some annoyance as with any other benevolent object , aired his pencil and his poverty ostentatiously before them , and told them he hoped in time to settle a crust of bread and cheese on his wife , and that he begged such of them as ( more fortunate than himself ) came in for any good thing , and could buy a picture , to please to remember the poor painter . Then Lord Decimus , who was a wonder on his own Parliamentary pedestal , turned out to be the windiest creature here : proposing happiness to the bride and bridegroom in a series of platitudes that would have made the hair of any sincere disciple and believer stand on end ; and trotting , with the complacency of an idiotic elephant , among howling labyrinths of sentences which he seemed to take for high roads , and never so much as wanted to get out of . Then Mr Tite Barnacle could not but feel that there was a person in company , who would have disturbed his life - long sitting to Sir Thomas Lawrence in full official character , if such disturbance had been possible : while Barnacle junior did , with indignation , communicate to two vapid gentlemen , his relatives , that there was a feller here , look here , who had come to our Department without an appointment and said he wanted to know , you know ; and that , look here , if he was to break out now , as he might you know ( for you never could tell what an ungentlemanly Radical of that sort would be up to next ) , and was to say , look here , that he wanted to know this moment , you know , that would be jolly ; would n’t it ? The pleasantest part of the occasion by far , to Clennam , was the painfullest . When Mr and Mrs Meagles at last hung about Pet in the room with the two pictures ( where the company were not ) , before going with her to the threshold which she could never recross to be the old Pet and the old delight , nothing could be more natural and simple than the three were . Gowan himself was touched , and answered Mr Meagles ’s ‘
205256	205260	203858	203860	the honourable gentleman	2100	’ with an earnest ‘
205276	205539	205273	205273	I	0	’ And so , with the last sobs and last loving words , and a last look to Clennam of confidence in his promise , Pet fell back in the carriage , and her husband waved his hand , and they were away for Dover ; though not until the faithful Mrs Tickit , in her silk gown and jet black curls , had rushed out from some hiding - place , and thrown both her shoes after the carriage : an apparition which occasioned great surprise to the distinguished company at the windows . The said company being now relieved from further attendance , and the chief Barnacles being rather hurried ( for they had it in hand just then to send a mail or two which was in danger of going straight to its destination , beating about the seas like the Flying Dutchman , and to arrange with complexity for the stoppage of a good deal of important business otherwise in peril of being done ) , went their several ways ; with all affability conveying to Mr and Mrs Meagles that general assurance that what they had been doing there , they had been doing at a sacrifice for Mr and Mrs Meagles ’s good , which they always conveyed to Mr John Bull in their official condescension to that most unfortunate creature . A miserable blank remained in the house and in the hearts of the father and mother and Clennam . Mr Meagles called only one remembrance to his aid , that really did him good . ‘
205547	205551	205545	205545	Arthur	304	’ he said , ‘
205560	205561	205273	205273	I	0	’ ‘
205565	205569	205273	205273	I	0	’ said Clennam . ‘
205578	205600	205573	205573	I	0	’ It had made him much more low and unhappy at the time , but now it really did him good . ‘
205606	205621	205573	205573	I	0	’ he said , often repeating the remark in the course of the evening . ‘
205626	205769	205770	205770	I	0	’ CHAPTER 35 . What was behind Mr Pancks on Little Dorrit ’s Hand It was at this time that Mr Pancks , in discharge of his compact with Clennam , revealed to him the whole of his gipsy story , and told him Little Dorrit ’s fortune . Her father was heir - at - law to a great estate that had long lain unknown of , unclaimed , and accumulating . His right was now clear , nothing interposed in his way , the Marshalsea gates stood open , the Marshalsea walls were down , a few flourishes of his pen , and he was extremely rich . In his tracking out of the claim to its complete establishment , Mr Pancks had shown a sagacity that nothing could baffle , and a patience and secrecy that nothing could tire . ‘
205776	205780	205770	205770	I	0	’ said Pancks , ‘
205844	205994	205839	205842	the Dorrits of Dorsetshire	5384	’ He then went on to detail . How , having that name recorded in his note - book , he was first attracted by the name alone . How , having often found two exactly similar names , even belonging to the same place , to involve no traceable consanguinity , near or distant , he did not at first give much heed to this , except in the way of speculation as to what a surprising change would be made in the condition of a little seamstress , if she could be shown to have any interest in so large a property . How he rather supposed himself to have pursued the idea into its next degree , because there was something uncommon in the quiet little seamstress , which pleased him and provoked his curiosity . How he had felt his way inch by inch , and ‘
206000	206137	205839	205842	the Dorrits of Dorsetshire	5384	’ ( that was Mr Pancks ’s expression ) , grain by grain . How , in the beginning of the labour described by this new verb , and to render which the more expressive Mr Pancks shut his eyes in pronouncing it and shook his hair over them , he had alternated from sudden lights and hopes to sudden darkness and no hopes , and back again , and back again . How he had made acquaintances in the Prison , expressly that he might come and go there as all other comers and goers did ; and how his first ray of light was unconsciously given him by Mr Dorrit himself and by his son ; to both of whom he easily became known ; with both of whom he talked much , casually [ ‘
206145	206310	206141	206141	you	933	’ said Mr Pancks ): and from whom he derived , without being at all suspected , two or three little points of family history which , as he began to hold clues of his own , suggested others . How it had at length become plain to Mr Pancks that he had made a real discovery of the heir - at - law to a great fortune , and that his discovery had but to be ripened to legal fulness and perfection . How he had , thereupon , sworn his landlord , Mr Rugg , to secrecy in a solemn manner , and taken him into Moleing partnership . How they had employed John Chivery as their sole clerk and agent , seeing to whom he was devoted . And how , until the present hour , when authorities mighty in the Bank and learned in the law declared their successful labours ended , they had confided in no other human being . ‘
206322	206326	206320	206320	sir	933	’ concluded Pancks , ‘
206371	206411	206412	206412	My	0	’ Clennam , who had been almost incessantly shaking hands with him throughout the narrative , was reminded by this to say , in an amazement which even the preparation he had had for the main disclosure smoothed down , ‘

206435	206441	206414	206415	Mr Pancks	396	’ said the triumphant Pancks . ‘

206614	206628	206629	206631	Generous old buck	5395	’ said Mr Pancks , entering on a series of the dryest snorts . ‘
206668	206687	206688	206688	I	0	’ Arthur felt an awkward consciousness of having , in his exultant condition , been a little premature . ‘
206698	206711	206688	206688	I	0	’ Mr Pancks pursued , appearing greatly to relish this descriptive epithet , ‘
206838	206857	206816	206818	a perfect Patriarch	5405	’ Arthur for his life could not have said with confidence whether Pancks really thought so or not . ‘
206865	206869	206816	206818	a perfect Patriarch	5405	’ resumed Pancks , ‘

207013	207017	207010	207011	Mr Pancks	396	’ said Clennam , ‘

207140	207215	207220	207221	Mr Rugg	506	’ This conversation took place in Clennam ’s bed - room , while he was yet in bed . For Mr Pancks had knocked up the house and made his way in , very early in the morning ; and , without once sitting down or standing still , had delivered himself of the whole of his details ( illustrated with a variety of documents ) at the bedside . He now said he would ‘
207222	207381	207385	207385	Arthur	304	’ , from whom his excited state of mind appeared to require another back ; and bundling up his papers , and exchanging one more hearty shake of the hand with Clennam , he went at full speed down - stairs , and steamed off . Clennam , of course , resolved to go direct to Mr Casby ’s . He dressed and got out so quickly that he found himself at the corner of the patriarchal street nearly an hour before her time ; but he was not sorry to have the opportunity of calming himself with a leisurely walk . When he returned to the street , and had knocked at the bright brass knocker , he was informed that she had come , and was shown up - stairs to Flora ’s breakfast - room . Little Dorrit was not there herself , but Flora was , and testified the greatest amazement at seeing him . ‘
207391	207396	207387	207387	Doyce	374	’ cried that lady , ‘

207675	207693	207694	207694	Papa	407	’ She was making the tea when Arthur came in , and now hastily finished that operation . ‘
207696	207715	207694	207694	Papa	407	’ she said , all mystery and whisper , as she shut down the tea - pot lid , ‘
207771	207837	207759	207759	she	5417	’ Arthur then told her , in the fewest words , that it was their little friend he came to see ; and what he had to announce to their little friend . At which astounding intelligence , Flora clasped her hands , fell into a tremble , and shed tears of sympathy and pleasure , like the good - natured creature she really was . ‘

207939	208026	208027	208028	Mr Clennam	304	’ Arthur nodded his free permission , since Flora shut out all verbal communication . Flora nodded in return to thank him , and hurried out of the room . Little Dorrit ’s step was already on the stairs , and in another moment she was at the door . Do what he could to compose his face , he could not convey so much of an ordinary expression into it , but that the moment she saw it she dropped her work , and cried , ‘
208035	208036	208027	208028	Mr Clennam	304	’ ‘
208068	208069	208178	208178	Your	5420	’ ‘
208074	208075	208178	208178	Your	5420	’ ‘
208079	208161	208178	208178	Your	5420	’ They stood in a window , and her eyes , full of light , were fixed upon his face . He put an arm about her , seeing her likely to sink down . She put a hand upon that arm , partly to rest upon it , and partly so to preserve their relative positions as that her intent look at him should be shaken by no change of attitude in either of them . Her lips seemed to repeat ‘
208165	208173	208178	208178	Your	5420	’ He repeated it again , aloud . ‘
208181	208247	208178	208179	Your father	9882	’ The ice of the pale face broke at the word , and little lights and shoots of expression passed all over it . They were all expressions of pain . Her breath was faint and hurried . Her heart beat fast . He would have clasped the little figure closer , but he saw that the eyes appealed to him not to be moved . ‘
208312	208328	208298	208298	we	5423	’ That brought her back . Her eyes were closing , but they opened again . ‘
208359	208363	208354	208354	I	0	’ Her lips shaped ‘
208366	208367	208354	208354	I	0	’ ‘
208414	208445	208447	208447	you	0	’ She seemed to entreat him for a little time . He held her in his arm , and , after a pause , bent down his ear to listen . ‘
208454	208455	208447	208447	you	0	’ ‘
208458	208459	208447	208447	you	0	’ ‘
208511	208535	208536	208536	Father	1100	’ As he kissed her , she turned her head towards his shoulder , and raised her arm towards his neck ; cried out ‘
208542	208752	208540	208540	Father	1100	’ and swooned away . Upon which Flora returned to take care of her , and hovered about her on a sofa , intermingling kind offices and incoherent scraps of conversation in a manner so confounding , that whether she pressed the Marshalsea to take a spoonful of unclaimed dividends , for it would do her good ; or whether she congratulated Little Dorrit ’s father on coming into possession of a hundred thousand smelling - bottles ; or whether she explained that she put seventy - five thousand drops of spirits of lavender on fifty thousand pounds of lump sugar , and that she entreated Little Dorrit to take that gentle restorative ; or whether she bathed the foreheads of Doyce and Clennam in vinegar , and gave the late Mr F. more air ; no one with any sense of responsibility could have undertaken to decide . A tributary stream of confusion , moreover , poured in from an adjoining bedroom , where Mr F. ’s Aunt appeared , from the sound of her voice , to be in a horizontal posture , awaiting her breakfast ; and from which bower that inexorable lady snapped off short taunts , whenever she could get a hearing , as , ‘
208761	208763	208764	208764	He	5438	’ and ‘
208775	208777	208764	208764	He	5438	’ and ‘
208798	208886	208784	208784	I	0	’ all designed to disparage Clennam ’s share in the discovery , and to relieve those inveterate feelings with which Mr F. ’s Aunt regarded him . But Little Dorrit ’s solicitude to get to her father , and to carry the joyful tidings to him , and not to leave him in his jail a moment with this happiness in store for him and still unknown to him , did more for her speedy restoration than all the skill and attention on earth could have done . ‘
208903	208975	208976	208976	I	0	’ were the first words she said . Her father , her father . She spoke of nothing but him , thought of nothing but him . Kneeling down and pouring out her thankfulness with uplifted hands , her thanks were for her father . Flora ’s tenderness was quite overcome by this , and she launched out among the cups and saucers into a wonderful flow of tears and speech . ‘
208979	208983	208976	208976	I	0	’ she sobbed , ‘
209317	209815	209816	209816	Father	290	’ Thus Flora , in taking leave of her favourite . Little Dorrit thanked her , and embraced her , over and over again ; and finally came out of the house with Clennam , and took coach for the Marshalsea . It was a strangely unreal ride through the old squalid streets , with a sensation of being raised out of them into an airy world of wealth and grandeur . When Arthur told her that she would soon ride in her own carriage through very different scenes , when all the familiar experiences would have vanished away , she looked frightened . But when he substituted her father for herself , and told her how he would ride in his carriage , and how great and grand he would be , her tears of joy and innocent pride fell fast . Seeing that the happiness her mind could realise was all shining upon him , Arthur kept that single figure before her ; and so they rode brightly through the poor streets in the prison neighbourhood to carry him the great news . When Mr Chivery , who was on duty , admitted them into the Lodge , he saw something in their faces which filled him with astonishment . He stood looking after them , when they hurried into the prison , as though he perceived that they had come back accompanied by a ghost a - piece . Two or three Collegians whom they passed , looked after them too , and presently joining Mr Chivery , formed a little group on the Lodge steps , in the midst of which there spontaneously originated a whisper that the Father was going to get his discharge . Within a few minutes , it was heard in the remotest room in the College . Little Dorrit opened the door from without , and they both entered . He was sitting in his old grey gown and his old black cap , in the sunlight by the window , reading his newspaper . His glasses were in his hand , and he had just looked round ; surprised at first , no doubt , by her step upon the stairs , not expecting her until night ; surprised again , by seeing Arthur Clennam in her company . As they came in , the same unwonted look in both of them which had already caught attention in the yard below , struck him . He did not rise or speak , but laid down his glasses and his newspaper on the table beside him , and looked at them with his mouth a little open and his lips trembling . When Arthur put out his hand , he touched it , but not with his usual state ; and then he turned to his daughter , who had sat down close beside him with her hands upon his shoulder , and looked attentively in her face . ‘
209827	209828	209818	209818	I	0	’ ‘
209839	209840	209829	209829	You	0	’ ‘
209892	209921	209883	209883	I	0	’ Her agitation was exceedingly great , and the tears rolled down her face . He put his hand suddenly to his heart , and looked at Clennam . ‘
209927	209931	209923	209923	yourself	304	’ said Clennam , ‘
209981	209982	209983	209984	Mr Clennam	304	’ ‘
209996	210007	210008	210008	me	0	’ He touched himself upon the breast , instead of saying ‘
210010	210011	210008	210008	me	0	’ ‘
210014	210018	210008	210008	me	0	’ returned Clennam . ‘
210022	210056	210008	210008	me	0	’ he asked , keeping his left hand over his heart , and there stopping in his speech , while with his right hand he put his glasses exactly level on the table : ‘
210067	210068	210008	210008	me	0	’ ‘
210113	210174	210008	210008	me	0	’ He looked steadfastly at Clennam , and , so looking at him , seemed to change into a very old haggard man . The sun was bright upon the wall beyond the window , and on the spikes at top . He slowly stretched out the hand that had been upon his heart , and pointed at the wall . ‘
210179	210183	210008	210008	me	0	’ said Clennam . ‘
210186	210199	210008	210008	me	0	’ He remained in the same attitude , looking steadfastly at him . ‘
210205	210213	210231	210232	Mr Dorrit	353	’ said Clennam , slowly and distinctly , ‘
210305	210381	210382	210382	I	0	’ With those words , he pressed his hand and released it ; and his daughter , laying her face against his , encircled him in the hour of his prosperity with her arms , as she had in the long years of his adversity encircled him with her love and toil and truth ; and poured out her full heart in gratitude , hope , joy , blissful ecstasy , and all for him . ‘
210440	210699	210700	210700	He	5469	’ He yielded himself to her kisses and caresses , but did not return them , except that he put an arm about her . Neither did he say one word . His steadfast look was now divided between her and Clennam , and he began to shake as if he were very cold . Explaining to Little Dorrit that he would run to the coffee - house for a bottle of wine , Arthur fetched it with all the haste he could use . While it was being brought from the cellar to the bar , a number of excited people asked him what had happened ; when he hurriedly informed them that Mr Dorrit had succeeded to a fortune . On coming back with the wine in his hand , he found that she had placed her father in his easy chair , and had loosened his shirt and neckcloth . They filled a tumbler with wine , and held it to his lips . When he had swallowed a little , he took the glass himself and emptied it . Soon after that , he leaned back in his chair and cried , with his handkerchief before his face . After this had lasted a while Clennam thought it a good season for diverting his attention from the main surprise , by relating its details . Slowly , therefore , and in a quiet tone of voice , he explained them as best he could , and enlarged on the nature of Pancks ’s service . ‘
210714	210728	210712	210712	sir	933	’ said the Father , starting up and moving hurriedly about the room . ‘
210805	210824	210825	210825	Everybody	1574	’ He had no purpose in going about the room , but he was not still a moment . ‘
210827	210831	210825	210825	Everybody	1574	’ he said , ‘
210894	210895	210891	210892	Mr Clennam	304	’ ‘
210901	210912	210897	210897	you	933	’ said Arthur , laying his purse on the table , ‘
210936	210937	210922	210922	I	0	’ ‘
210987	211004	211009	211009	sir	933	’ His hand had closed upon the money , and he carried it about with him . ‘
211063	211090	211097	211098	a milliner	10326	’ His eye fell upon his daughter at this point , and he stopped for a moment to kiss her , and to pat her head . ‘
211227	211278	211306	211306	They	5490	’ This was the first intimation he had ever given , that he was privy to the fact that they did something for a livelihood . He was still jogging about the room , with the purse clutched in his hand , when a great cheering arose in the yard . ‘
211285	211295	211306	211306	They	5490	’ said Clennam , looking down from the window . ‘
211317	211318	211306	211306	They	5490	’ ‘
211336	211350	211327	211327	I	0	’ he said , jogging about in a more feverish flutter than before , ‘
211449	211513	211514	211515	Poor creatures	5496	’ With his trembling hand he pushed his grey hair up , and then , taking Clennam and his daughter for supporters , appeared at the window leaning on an arm of each . The Collegians cheered him very heartily , and he kissed his hand to them with great urbanity and protection . When he withdrew into the room again , he said ‘
211517	211752	211753	211754	Mr Clennam	304	’ in a tone of much pity for their miserable condition . Little Dorrit was deeply anxious that he should lie down to compose himself . On Arthur ’s speaking to her of his going to inform Pancks that he might now appear as soon as he would , and pursue the joyful business to its close , she entreated him in a whisper to stay with her until her father should be quite calm and at rest . He needed no second entreaty ; and she prepared her father ’s bed , and begged him to lie down . For another half - hour or more he would be persuaded to do nothing but go about the room , discussing with himself the probabilities for and against the Marshal ’s allowing the whole of the prisoners to go to the windows of the official residence which commanded the street , to see himself and family depart for ever in a carriage -- which , he said , he thought would be a Sight for them . But gradually he began to droop and tire , and at last stretched himself upon the bed . She took her faithful place beside him , fanning him and cooling his forehead ; and he seemed to be falling asleep ( always with the money in his hand ) , when he unexpectedly sat up and said : ‘
211793	211794	211795	211795	I	0	’ ‘
211802	211808	211799	211800	Mr Dorrit	353	’ was the unwilling reply . ‘
211845	211853	211829	211829	I	0	’ At this he shed tears again . ‘
211863	211870	211861	211861	sir	933	’ Clennam cheerfully urged upon him . ‘
211877	211885	211875	211875	sir	933	’ he returned in a sudden passion . ‘
211918	212026	211898	211898	you	933	’ It was his last demonstration for that time ; as , after shedding some more tears and querulously complaining that he could n’t breathe , he slowly fell into a slumber . Clennam had abundant occupation for his thoughts , as he sat in the quiet room watching the father on his bed , and the daughter fanning his face . Little Dorrit had been thinking too . After softly putting his grey hair aside , and touching his forehead with her lips , she looked towards Arthur , who came nearer to her , and pursued in a low whisper the subject of her thoughts . ‘
212041	212042	211898	211898	you	933	’ ‘
212048	212049	211898	211898	you	933	’ ‘
212067	212068	211898	211898	you	933	’ ‘
212072	212100	211898	211898	you	933	’ There was something of uncertainty and remonstrance in her look ; something that was not all satisfaction . He wondered to detect it , and said : ‘
212110	212111	212113	212113	you	0	’ ‘
212115	212122	212113	212113	you	0	’ asked Little Dorrit , wistfully . ‘
212130	212131	212124	212124	I	0	’ ‘
212140	212141	212135	212135	I	0	’ ‘
212147	212148	212144	212144	you	0	’ ‘
212155	212160	212152	212152	me	0	’ said Little Dorrit , ‘
212199	212200	212201	212201	My	0	’ ‘
212204	212209	212201	212201	My	0	’ Clennam was beginning . ‘
212218	212223	212212	212212	I	0	’ she pleaded timidly , ‘
212240	212619	212625	212625	he	5508	’ The prison , which could spoil so many things , had tainted Little Dorrit ’s mind no more than this . Engendered as the confusion was , in compassion for the poor prisoner , her father , it was the first speck Clennam had ever seen , it was the last speck Clennam ever saw , of the prison atmosphere upon her . He thought this , and forbore to say another word . With the thought , her purity and goodness came before him in their brightest light . The little spot made them the more beautiful . Worn out with her own emotions , and yielding to the silence of the room , her hand slowly slackened and failed in its fanning movement , and her head dropped down on the pillow at her father ’s side . Clennam rose softly , opened and closed the door without a sound , and passed from the prison , carrying the quiet with him into the turbulent streets . CHAPTER 36 . The Marshalsea becomes an Orphan And now the day arrived when Mr Dorrit and his family were to leave the prison for ever , and the stones of its much - trodden pavement were to know them no more . The interval had been short , but he had greatly complained of its length , and had been imperious with Mr Rugg touching the delay . He had been high with Mr Rugg , and had threatened to employ some one else . He had requested Mr Rugg not to presume upon the place in which he found him , but to do his duty , sir , and to do it with promptitude . He had told Mr Rugg that he knew what lawyers and agents were , and that he would not submit to imposition . On that gentleman ’s humbly representing that he exerted himself to the utmost , Miss Fanny was very short with him ; desiring to know what less he could do , when he had been told a dozen times that money was no object , and expressing her suspicion that he forgot whom he talked to . Towards the Marshal , who was a Marshal of many years ’
213255	213264	213248	213248	he	304	‘ it is a donation , not a loan ’
213332	213872	213318	213318	they	456	’ standing , the event was creditable to the College , and made it famous in the newspapers . Perhaps more of them thought , too , than were quite aware of it , that the thing might in the lottery of chances have happened to themselves , or that something of the sort might yet happen to themselves some day or other . They took it very well . A few were low at the thought of being left behind , and being left poor ; but even these did not grudge the family their brilliant reverse . There might have been much more envy in politer places . It seems probable that mediocrity of fortune would have been disposed to be less magnanimous than the Collegians , who lived from hand to mouth -- from the pawnbroker ’s hand to the day ’s dinner . They got up an address to him , which they presented in a neat frame and glass ( though it was not afterwards displayed in the family mansion or preserved among the family papers ) ; and to which he returned a gracious answer . In that document he assured them , in a Royal manner , that he received the profession of their attachment with a full conviction of its sincerity ; and again generally exhorted them to follow his example -- which , at least in so far as coming into a great property was concerned , there is no doubt they would have gladly imitated . He took the same occasion of inviting them to a comprehensive entertainment , to be given to the whole College in the yard , and at which he signified he would have the honour of taking a parting glass to the health and happiness of all those whom he was about to leave behind . He did not in person dine at this public repast ( it took place at two in the afternoon , and his dinners now came in from the hotel at six ) , but his son was so good as to take the head of the principal table , and to be very free and engaging . He himself went about among the company , and took notice of individuals , and saw that the viands were of the quality he had ordered , and that all were served . On the whole , he was like a baron of the olden time in a rare good humour . At the conclusion of the repast , he pledged his guests in a bumper of old Madeira ; and told them that he hoped they had enjoyed themselves , and what was more , that they would enjoy themselves for the rest of the evening ; that he wished them well ; and that he bade them welcome . His health being drunk with acclamations , he was not so baronial after all but that in trying to return thanks he broke down , in the manner of a mere serf with a heart in his breast , and wept before them all . After this great success , which he supposed to be a failure , he gave them ‘
213880	214133	213318	213318	they	456	’ whom he had beforehand presented with ten pounds each , and who were all in attendance . Mr Chivery spoke to the toast , saying , What you undertake to lock up , lock up ; but remember that you are , in the words of the fettered African , a man and a brother ever . The list of toasts disposed of , Mr Dorrit urbanely went through the motions of playing a game of skittles with the Collegian who was the next oldest inhabitant to himself ; and left the tenantry to their diversions . But all these occurrences preceded the final day . And now the day arrived when he and his family were to leave the prison for ever , and when the stones of its much - trodden pavement were to know them no more . Noon was the hour appointed for the departure . As it approached , there was not a Collegian within doors , nor a turnkey absent . The latter class of gentlemen appeared in their Sunday clothes , and the greater part of the Collegians were brightened up as much as circumstances allowed . Two or three flags were even displayed , and the children put on odds and ends of ribbon . Mr Dorrit himself , at this trying time , preserved a serious but graceful dignity . Much of his great attention was given to his brother , as to whose bearing on the great occasion he felt anxious . ‘
214138	214142	213318	213318	they	456	’ said he , ‘
214176	214177	214174	214174	Frederick	353	’ ‘
214180	214184	214174	214174	Frederick	353	’ said Frederick . ‘
214193	214194	214174	214174	Frederick	353	’ ‘
214232	214233	214234	214234	William	524	’ ‘
214238	214247	214236	214236	William	524	’ said the other , shaking his head , ‘
214268	214269	214236	214236	William	524	’ ‘
214276	214280	214291	214291	you	353	’ returned William , ‘
214316	214317	214314	214314	Your	353	’ ‘
214320	214324	214325	214325	Your	353	’ said Frederick . ‘
214332	214333	214334	214334	Mine	353	’ ‘
214336	214362	214334	214334	Mine	353	’ He looked first at his own figure , and then at his brother ’s , and then , drawing a long breath , cried , ‘
214375	214376	214334	214334	Mine	353	’ ‘
214444	214445	214446	214446	William	524	’ ‘
214448	214459	214446	214446	William	524	’ said the other weakly , and with a sigh , ‘
214515	214516	214517	214517	My	0	’ ‘
214536	214537	214533	214533	yours	524	’ ‘
214542	214547	214533	214533	yours	524	’ returned the other . ‘
214564	214579	214554	214554	William	524	’ William passed his hand across his eyes , and murmured with august satisfaction , ‘
214590	214596	214554	214554	William	524	’ Then he said aloud , ‘
214629	214630	214625	214625	you	353	’ ‘
214641	214647	214633	214633	you	0	’ returned his submissive brother . ‘
214676	214677	214672	214672	I	0	’ ‘
214682	214687	214672	214672	I	0	’ cried his brother . ‘
214693	214694	214695	214695	I	0	’ ‘
214723	214724	214718	214718	they	5563	’ ‘
214727	214732	214718	214718	they	5563	’ returned his brother . ‘
214767	215451	214751	214751	they	5563	’ Twelve o’clock having just struck , and the carriage being reported ready in the outer court - yard , the brothers proceeded down - stairs arm - in - arm . Edward Dorrit , Esquire ( once Tip ) , and his sister Fanny followed , also arm - in - arm ; Mr Plornish and Maggy , to whom had been entrusted the removal of such of the family effects as were considered worth removing , followed , bearing bundles and burdens to be packed in a cart . In the yard , were the Collegians and turnkeys . In the yard , were Mr Pancks and Mr Rugg , come to see the last touch given to their work . In the yard , was Young John making a new epitaph for himself , on the occasion of his dying of a broken heart . In the yard , was the Patriarchal Casby , looking so tremendously benevolent that many enthusiastic Collegians grasped him fervently by the hand , and the wives and female relatives of many more Collegians kissed his hand , nothing doubting that he had done it all . In the yard , was the man with the shadowy grievance respecting the Fund which the Marshal embezzled , who had got up at five in the morning to complete the copying of a perfectly unintelligible history of that transaction , which he had committed to Mr Dorrit ’s care , as a document of the last importance , calculated to stun the Government and effect the Marshal ’s downfall . In the yard , was the insolvent whose utmost energies were always set on getting into debt , who broke into prison with as much pains as other men have broken out of it , and who was always being cleared and complimented ; while the insolvent at his elbow -- a mere little , snivelling , striving tradesman , half dead of anxious efforts to keep out of debt -- found it a hard matter , indeed , to get a Commissioner to release him with much reproof and reproach . In the yard , was the man of many children and many burdens , whose failure astonished everybody ; in the yard , was the man of no children and large resources , whose failure astonished nobody . There , were the people who were always going out to - morrow , and always putting it off ; there , were the people who had come in yesterday , and who were much more jealous and resentful of this freak of fortune than the seasoned birds . There , were some who , in pure meanness of spirit , cringed and bowed before the enriched Collegian and his family ; there , were others who did so really because their eyes , accustomed to the gloom of their imprisonment and poverty , could not support the light of such bright sunshine . There , were many whose shillings had gone into his pocket to buy him meat and drink ; but none who were now obtrusively Hail fellow well met ! with him , on the strength of that assistance . It was rather to be remarked of the caged birds , that they were a little shy of the bird about to be so grandly free , and that they had a tendency to withdraw themselves towards the bars , and seem a little fluttered as he passed . Through these spectators the little procession , headed by the two brothers , moved slowly to the gate . Mr Dorrit , yielding to the vast speculation how the poor creatures were to get on without him , was great , and sad , but not absorbed . He patted children on the head like Sir Roger de Coverley going to church , he spoke to people in the background by their Christian names , he condescended to all present , and seemed for their consolation to walk encircled by the legend in golden characters , ‘
215461	215521	215522	215523	Good Gracious	570	’ At last three honest cheers announced that he had passed the gate , and that the Marshalsea was an orphan . Before they had ceased to ring in the echoes of the prison walls , the family had got into their carriage , and the attendant had the steps in his hand . Then , and not before , ‘
215525	215533	215522	215523	Good Gracious	570	’ cried Miss Fanny all at once , ‘
215538	215555	215536	215536	Amy	331	’ Her father had thought she was with her sister . Her sister had thought she was ‘
215560	215645	215536	215536	Amy	331	’ They had all trusted to finding her , as they had always done , quietly in the right place at the right moment . This going away was perhaps the very first action of their joint lives that they had got through without her . A minute might have been consumed in the ascertaining of these points , when Miss Fanny , who , from her seat in the carriage , commanded the long narrow passage leading to the Lodge , flushed indignantly . ‘
215653	215657	215651	215651	Pa	548	’ cried she , ‘
215663	215664	215651	215651	Pa	548	’ ‘
215671	215672	215673	215673	I	0	’ ‘
215677	215681	215673	215673	I	0	’ she repeated , ‘
215821	215850	215817	215818	Mr Clennam	304	’ The offence was proved , as she delivered the indictment . Clennam appeared at the carriage - door , bearing the little insensible figure in his arms . ‘
215856	215870	215871	215871	I	0	’ he said , in a tone of pity not free from reproach . ‘
215950	215951	215953	215953	you	304	’ ‘
215957	215966	215955	215955	sir	933	’ returned Miss Dorrit , bursting into tears . ‘
216031	216047	216025	216025	Pa	548	’ The attendant , getting between Clennam and the carriage - door , with a sharp ‘
216054	216912	216025	216025	Pa	548	’ bundled up the steps , and they drove away . BOOK THE SECOND : RICHES CHAPTER 1 . Fellow Travellers In the autumn of the year , Darkness and Night were creeping up to the highest ridges of the Alps . It was vintage time in the valleys on the Swiss side of the Pass of the Great Saint Bernard , and along the banks of the Lake of Geneva . The air there was charged with the scent of gathered grapes . Baskets , troughs , and tubs of grapes stood in the dim village doorways , stopped the steep and narrow village streets , and had been carrying all day along the roads and lanes . Grapes , split and crushed under foot , lay about everywhere . The child carried in a sling by the laden peasant woman toiling home , was quieted with picked - up grapes ; the idiot sunning his big goitre under the leaves of the wooden chalet by the way to the Waterfall , sat munching grapes ; the breath of the cows and goats was redolent of leaves and stalks of grapes ; the company in every little cabaret were eating , drinking , talking grapes . A pity that no ripe touch of this generous abundance could be given to the thin , hard , stony wine , which after all was made from the grapes ! The air had been warm and transparent through the whole of the bright day . Shining metal spires and church - roofs , distant and rarely seen , had sparkled in the view ; and the snowy mountain - tops had been so clear that unaccustomed eyes , cancelling the intervening country , and slighting their rugged heights for something fabulous , would have measured them as within a few hours easy reach . Mountain - peaks of great celebrity in the valleys , whence no trace of their existence was visible sometimes for months together , had been since morning plain and near in the blue sky . And now , when it was dark below , though they seemed solemnly to recede , like spectres who were going to vanish , as the red dye of the sunset faded out of them and left them coldly white , they were yet distinctly defined in their loneliness above the mists and shadows . Seen from these solitudes , and from the Pass of the Great Saint Bernard , which was one of them , the ascending Night came up the mountain like a rising water . When it at last rose to the walls of the convent of the Great Saint Bernard , it was as if that weather - beaten structure were another Ark , and floated on the shadowy waves . Darkness , outstripping some visitors on mules , had risen thus to the rough convent walls , when those travellers were yet climbing the mountain . As the heat of the glowing day when they had stopped to drink at the streams of melted ice and snow , was changed to the searching cold of the frosty rarefied night air at a great height , so the fresh beauty of the lower journey had yielded to barrenness and desolation . A craggy track , up which the mules in single file scrambled and turned from block to block , as though they were ascending the broken staircase of a gigantic ruin , was their way now . No trees were to be seen , nor any vegetable growth save a poor brown scrubby moss , freezing in the chinks of rock . Blackened skeleton arms of wood by the wayside pointed upward to the convent as if the ghosts of former travellers overwhelmed by the snow haunted the scene of their distress . Icicle - hung caves and cellars built for refuges from sudden storms , were like so many whispers of the perils of the place ; never - resting wreaths and mazes of mist wandered about , hunted by a moaning wind ; and snow , the besetting danger of the mountain , against which all its defences were taken , drifted sharply down . The file of mules , jaded by their day ’s work , turned and wound slowly up the deep ascent ; the foremost led by a guide on foot , in his broad - brimmed hat and round jacket , carrying a mountain staff or two upon his shoulder , with whom another guide conversed . There was no speaking among the string of riders . The sharp cold , the fatigue of the journey , and a new sensation of a catching in the breath , partly as if they had just emerged from very clear crisp water , and partly as if they had been sobbing , kept them silent . At length , a light on the summit of the rocky staircase gleamed through the snow and mist . The guides called to the mules , the mules pricked up their drooping heads , the travellers ’
217345	217405	217406	217408	The living travellers	5594	‘ Surrounded by so many and such companions upon whom I never looked , and never shall look , I and my child will dwell together inseparable , on the Great Saint Bernard , outlasting generations who will come to see us , and will never know our name , or one word of our story but the end . ’
218045	218057	218059	218060	the Chief	5650	‘ My daughter , I am obliged to you , sir , ’
218062	218073	218059	218060	the Chief	5650	‘ is quite restored , and has been greatly interested . ’
218074	218081	218083	218085	the insinuating traveller	5652	‘ New to mountains , perhaps ? ’
218087	218096	218098	218099	the Chief	5650	‘ New to -- ha -- to mountains , ’
218101	218111	218112	218114	the insinuating traveller	5652	‘ But you are familiar with them , sir ? ’
218117	218136	218138	218139	the Chief	5650	‘ I am -- hum -- tolerably familiar . Not of late years . Not of late years , ’
218209	218214	218216	218218	the young lady	1678	‘ Incommoded , certainly , ’
218220	218225	218226	218228	The insinuating traveller	5652	‘ but not tired . ’
218266	218274	218276	218278	the young lady	1678	‘ We have had , of course , ’
218287	218324	218276	218278	the young lady	1678	‘ to leave the carriages and fourgon at Martigny . And the impossibility of bringing anything that one wants to this inaccessible place , and the necessity of leaving every comfort behind , is not convenient . ’
218325	218331	218333	218335	the insinuating traveller	5652	‘ A savage place indeed , ’
218372	218380	218381	218381	she	5665	‘ But , like other inconvenient places , ’
218384	218404	218381	218381	she	5665	‘ it must be seen . As a place much spoken of , it is necessary to see it . ’
218405	218425	218427	218428	the other	9761	‘ O ! I have not the least objection to seeing it , I assure you , Mrs General , ’
218432	218437	218439	218441	the insinuating traveller	5652	‘ You , madam , ’
218443	218450	218439	218441	the insinuating traveller	5652	‘ have visited this spot before ? ’
218451	218454	218456	218457	Mrs General	573	‘ Yes , ’
218459	218474	218456	218457	Mrs General	573	‘ I have been here before . Let me commend you , my dear , ’
218481	218507	218476	218479	the former young lady	5668	‘ to shade your face from the hot wood , after exposure to the mountain air and snow . You , too , my dear , ’
218526	218545	218521	218522	the former	12625	‘ Thank you , Mrs General , I am Perfectly comfortable , and prefer remaining as I am . ’
218620	218630	218631	218631	he	10553	‘ These fellows are an immense time with supper , ’
218634	218648	218631	218631	he	10553	‘ I wonder what they ’ll give us ! Has anybody any idea ? ’
218649	218657	218662	218669	the second gentleman of the party of three	5674	‘ Not roast man , I believe , ’
218671	218680	218681	218681	he	5674	‘ I suppose not . What d’ye mean ? ’
218684	218715	218717	218718	the other	9761	‘ That , as you are not to be served for the general supper , perhaps you will do us the favour of not cooking yourself at the general fire , ’
218825	218829	218831	218832	the gentleman	10907	‘ I think , ’
218838	218860	218831	218832	the gentleman	10907	‘ I had best carry her straight to her room . Will you call to some one to bring a light ? ’
218865	218887	218831	218832	the gentleman	10907	‘ and to show the way ? In this strange rambling place I do n’t know that I could find it . ’
218888	218897	218899	218904	the taller of the young ladies	5683	‘ Pray , let me call my maid , ’
218906	218918	218920	218927	the shorter , who had not spoken yet	5685	‘ Pray , let me put this water to her lips , ’
219089	219095	219097	219097	he	5650	‘ Your friend , sir , ’
219099	219150	219097	219097	he	5650	‘ is -- ha -- is a little impatient ; and , in his impatience , is not perhaps fully sensible of what he owes to -- hum -- to -- but we will waive that , we will waive that . Your friend is a little impatient , sir . ’
219151	219159	219161	219162	the other	9761	‘ It may be so , sir , ’
219164	219235	219161	219162	the other	9761	‘ But having had the honour of making that gentleman ’s acquaintance at the hotel at Geneva , where we and much good company met some time ago , and having had the honour of exchanging company and conversation with that gentleman on several subsequent excursions , I can hear nothing -- no , not even from one of your appearance and station , sir -- detrimental to that gentleman . ’
219236	219352	219097	219097	he	5650	‘ You are in no danger , sir , of hearing any such thing from me . In remarking that your friend has shown impatience , I say no such thing . I make that remark , because it is not to be doubted that my son , being by birth and by -- ha -- by education a -- hum -- a gentleman , would have readily adapted himself to any obligingly expressed wish on the subject of the fire being equally accessible to the whole of the present circle . Which , in principle , I -- ha -- for all are -- hum -- equal on these occasions -- I consider right . ’
219353	219356	219161	219162	the other	9761	‘ Good , ’
219361	219410	219161	219162	the other	9761	‘ And there it ends ! I am your son ’s obedient servant . I beg your son to receive the assurance of my profound consideration . And now , sir , I may admit , freely admit , that my friend is sometimes of a sarcastic temper . ’
219411	219422	219097	219097	he	5650	‘ The lady is your friend ’s wife , sir ? ’
219423	219434	219097	219097	he	5650	‘ The lady is my friend ’s wife , sir . ’
219435	219441	219161	219162	the other	9761	‘ She is very handsome . ’
219442	219476	219097	219097	he	5650	‘ Sir , she is peerless . They are still in the first year of their marriage . They are still partly on a marriage , and partly on an artistic , tour . ’
219477	219486	219487	219488	The gentleman	10907	‘ Your friend is an artist , sir ? ’
219528	219537	219538	219538	he	10907	‘ But he is a man of family , ’
219541	219606	219538	219538	he	10907	‘ His connections are of the best . He is more than an artist : he is highly connected . He may , in effect , have repudiated his connections , proudly , impatiently , sarcastically ( I make the concession of both words ) ; but he has them . Sparks that have been struck out during our intercourse have shown me this . ’
219607	219613	219615	219617	the lofty gentleman	5702	‘ Well ! I hope , ’
219629	219640	219615	219617	the lofty gentleman	5702	‘ that the lady ’s indisposition may be only temporary . ’
219641	219648	219538	219538	he	10907	‘ Sir , I hope so . ’
219649	219657	219538	219538	he	10907	‘ Mere fatigue , I dare say . ’
219658	219728	219615	219617	the lofty gentleman	5702	‘ Not altogether mere fatigue , sir , for her mule stumbled to - day , and she fell from the saddle . She fell lightly , and was up again without assistance , and rode from us laughing ; but she complained towards evening of a slight bruise in the side . She spoke of it more than once , as we followed your party up the mountain . ’
219862	219865	219866	219866	he	5709	‘ Pray , ’
219876	219887	219866	219866	he	5709	‘ has your convent many of its famous dogs now ? ’
219888	219895	219866	219866	he	5709	‘ Monsieur , it has three . ’
219896	219911	219912	219913	The host	3016	‘ I saw three in the gallery below . Doubtless the three in question . ’
219978	219983	219985	219987	the artist traveller	5709	‘ And I think , ’
219989	219998	219985	219987	the artist traveller	5709	‘ I have seen one of them before . ’
220047	220062	220063	220063	Monsieur	5724	‘ Which is done in its regular season of the year , I think ? ’
220067	220080	220063	220063	Monsieur	5724	‘ And never without a dog . The dog is very important . ’
220144	220154	220158	220158	his	5727	‘ Ask him if he has saved many lives ? ’
220188	220195	220182	220182	He	3016	‘ No . Not this one . ’
220196	220200	220201	220203	the same gentleman	5730	‘ Why not ? ’
220206	220209	220211	220212	the host	3016	‘ Pardon , ’
220215	220236	220211	220212	the host	3016	‘ give him the opportunity and he will do it without doubt . For example , I am well convinced , ’
220265	220289	220290	220292	The artist traveller	5709	‘ that if you , Monsieur , would give him the opportunity , he would hasten with great ardour to fulfil his duty . ’
220332	220344	220346	220346	he	5652	‘ It is becoming late in the year , my Father , ’
220348	220358	220346	220346	he	5652	‘ for tourist - travellers , is it not ? ’
220359	220385	220392	220394	the insinuating traveller	5652	‘ Yes , it is late . Yet two or three weeks , at most , and we shall be left to the winter snows . ’
220386	220390	220392	220394	the insinuating traveller	5652	‘ And then , ’
220396	220411	220392	220394	the insinuating traveller	5652	‘ for the scratching dogs and the buried children , according to the pictures ! ’
220412	220415	220417	220418	the host	3016	‘ Pardon , ’
220426	220442	220443	220445	The artist traveller	5709	‘ How , then the scratching dogs and the buried children according to the pictures ? ’
220456	220462	220463	220463	he	5652	‘ Do n’t you know , ’
220473	220493	220463	220463	he	5652	‘ that none but smugglers come this way in the winter or can have any possible business this way ? ’
220494	220505	220577	220579	the artist traveller	5709	‘ Holy blue ! No ; never heard of it . ’
220506	220575	220577	220579	the artist traveller	5709	‘ So it is , I believe . And as they know the signs of the weather tolerably well , they do n’t give much employment to the dogs -- who have consequently died out rather -- though this house of entertainment is conveniently situated for themselves . Their young families , I am told , they usually leave at home . But it ’s a grand idea ! ’
220589	220617	220577	220579	the artist traveller	5709	‘ It ’s a sublime idea . It ’s the finest idea in the world , and brings tears into a man ’s eyes , by Jupiter ! ’
220723	220726	220728	220728	he	5652	‘ Look , ’
220735	220950	220728	220728	he	5652	‘ at this gentleman our host , not yet in the prime of life , who in so graceful a way and with such courtly urbanity and modesty presides over us ! Manners fit for a crown ! Dine with the Lord Mayor of London ( if you can get an invitation ) and observe the contrast . This dear fellow , with the finest cut face I ever saw , a face in perfect drawing , leaves some laborious life and comes up here I do n’t know how many feet above the level of the sea , for no other purpose on earth ( except enjoying himself , I hope , in a capital refectory ) than to keep an hotel for idle poor devils like you and me , and leave the bill to our consciences ! Why , is n’t it a beautiful sacrifice ? What do we want more to touch us ? Because rescued people of interesting appearance are not , for eight or nine months out of every twelve , holding on here round the necks of the most sagacious of dogs carrying wooden bottles , shall we disparage the place ? No ! Bless the place . It ’s a great place , a glorious place ! ’
221102	221107	221109	221113	the grey - haired gentleman	5744	‘ But the confinement , ’
221149	221154	221156	221160	the grey - haired gentleman	5744	‘ But the space , ’
221162	221173	221156	221160	the grey - haired gentleman	5744	‘ So small . So -- ha -- very limited . ’
221298	221308	221310	221314	the grey - haired gentleman	5744	‘ I -- ha -- yes , very true , ’
221353	221361	221363	221364	the gentleman	10907	‘ Perfectly , perfectly . Without doubt , ’
221432	221437	221439	221439	Monsieur	5770	‘ It is true , ’
221441	221471	221439	221439	Monsieur	5770	‘ We will -- ha -- not pursue the subject . You are -- hum -- quite accurate , I have no doubt . We will say no more . ’
221898	221903	221882	221883	The visitor	9866	‘ Are you better ? ’
221934	221940	221941	221941	she	5777	‘ She is very pretty , ’
221946	221960	221941	221941	she	5777	‘ I never saw so beautiful a face . O how unlike me ! ’
221984	222021	222028	222028	she	5777	‘ I know I must be right . I know he spoke of her that evening . I could very easily be wrong on any other subject , but not on this , not on this ! ’
222051	222059	222060	222060	she	5777	‘ I like to look at her , ’
222065	222077	222060	222060	she	5777	‘ I like to see what has affected him so much . ’
222094	222131	222086	222087	the sleeper	9978	‘ Pray do n’t be alarmed . I am only one of the travellers from down - stairs . I came to ask if you were better , and if I could do anything for you . ’
222132	222150	222060	222060	she	5777	‘ I think you have already been so kind as to send your servants to my assistance ? ’
222151	222166	222060	222060	she	5777	‘ No , not I ; that was my sister . Are you better ? ’
222167	222217	222086	222087	the sleeper	9978	‘ Much better . It is only a slight bruise , and has been well looked to , and is almost easy now . It made me giddy and faint in a moment . It had hurt me before ; but at last it overpowered me all at once . ’
222218	222234	222060	222060	she	5777	‘ May I stay with you until some one comes ? Would you like it ? ’
222235	222259	222060	222060	she	5777	‘ I should like it , for it is lonely here ; but I am afraid you will feel the cold too much . ’
222260	222277	222278	222278	She	5800	‘ I do n’t mind cold . I am not delicate , if I look so . ’
222331	222343	222345	222346	the lady	3830	‘ You have so much the air of a kind nurse , ’
222352	222366	222345	222346	the lady	3830	‘ that you seem as if you had come to me from home . ’
222367	222375	222345	222346	the lady	3830	‘ I am very glad of it . ’
222376	222401	222345	222346	the lady	3830	‘ I was dreaming of home when I woke just now . Of my old home , I mean , before I was married . ’
222402	222413	222345	222346	the lady	3830	‘ And before you were so far away from it . ’
222414	222463	222473	222473	her	3830	‘ I have been much farther away from it than this ; but then I took the best part of it with me , and missed nothing . I felt solitary as I dropped asleep here , and , missing it a little , wandered back to it . ’
222489	222512	222514	222515	the visitor	9866	‘ It is a curious chance which at last brings us together , under this covering in which you have wrapped me , ’
222520	222537	222514	222515	the visitor	9866	‘ for do you know , I think I have been looking for you some time . ’
222538	222543	222514	222515	the visitor	9866	‘ Looking for me ? ’
222544	222585	222586	222587	The lady	3830	‘ I believe I have a little note here , which I was to give to you whenever I found you . This is it . Unless I greatly mistake , it is addressed to you ? Is it not ? ’
222633	222671	222618	222618	she	3830	‘ The dear young friend to whom he presents me , may be a comfort to me at some time , he says . She is truly a comfort to me the first time I see her . ’
222672	222678	222680	222681	the visitor	9866	‘ Perhaps you do n’t , ’
222699	222700	222692	222692	he	5809	’ ‘
222703	222704	222710	222710	he	5809	’ ‘
222789	222790	222791	222791	You	3946	’ ‘
222798	222803	222791	222791	You	3946	’ said the other ; ‘
222843	222872	222873	222873	I	0	’ She did so with great care . Her small , slight hand was still upon the letter , when they heard some one in the gallery outside . ‘
222876	222883	222873	222873	I	0	’ said the visitor , rising , ‘
222926	222927	222916	222916	I	0	’ ‘
222956	222957	222945	222945	I	0	’ ‘
222981	222982	222947	222947	him	9915	’ ‘
222998	223375	222990	222990	you	3946	’ Both of them were hurried and fluttered as they exchanged this parting , and as the visitor came out of the door . She had expected to meet the lady ’s husband approaching it ; but the person in the gallery was not he : it was the traveller who had wiped the wine - drops from his moustache with the piece of bread . When he heard the step behind him , he turned round -- for he was walking away in the dark . His politeness , which was extreme , would not allow of the young lady ’s lighting herself down - stairs , or going down alone . He took her lamp , held it so as to throw the best light on the stone steps , and followed her all the way to the supper - room . She went down , not easily hiding how much she was inclined to shrink and tremble ; for the appearance of this traveller was particularly disagreeable to her . She had sat in her quiet corner before supper imagining what he would have been in the scenes and places within her experience , until he inspired her with an aversion that made him little less than terrific . He followed her down with his smiling politeness , followed her in , and resumed his seat in the best place in the hearth . There with the wood - fire , which was beginning to burn low , rising and falling upon him in the dark room , he sat with his legs thrust out to warm , drinking the hot wine down to the lees , with a monstrous shadow imitating him on the wall and ceiling . The tired company had broken up , and all the rest were gone to bed except the young lady ’s father , who dozed in his chair by the fire . The traveller had been at the pains of going a long way up - stairs to his sleeping - room to fetch his pocket - flask of brandy . He told them so , as he poured its contents into what was left of the wine , and drank with a new relish . ‘
223391	223413	223414	223414	I	0	’ The grey - haired gentleman had roused himself , and was preparing to withdraw . He answered in the affirmative . ‘
223417	223422	223414	223414	I	0	’ said the traveller . ‘
223449	223465	223466	223466	We	5817	’ The gentleman bowed , distantly enough , and said he was obliged to him . ‘
223472	223496	223466	223468	We poor gentlemen	5818	’ said the traveller , pulling his moustache dry with his hand , for he had dipped it in the wine and brandy ; ‘
223524	223525	223526	223526	Sir	933	’ ‘
223532	223533	223526	223526	Sir	933	’ ‘
223550	223551	223552	223552	Sir	933	’ ‘
223578	223579	223580	223580	They	11481	’ ‘
223587	223588	223580	223580	They	11481	’ ‘
223592	223621	223580	223580	They	11481	’ said the traveller , rising and holding the door open , as the gentleman crossed the room towards it with his arm drawn through his daughter ’s . ‘
223639	223676	223580	223580	They	11481	’ As he kissed his hand , with his best manner and his daintiest smile , the young lady drew a little nearer to her father , and passed him with a dread of touching him . ‘
223679	223699	223580	223580	They	11481	’ said the insinuating traveller , whose manner shrunk , and whose voice dropped when he was left alone . ‘
223747	223764	223580	223580	They	11481	’ Throwing back his head in emptying his glass , he cast his eyes upon the travellers ’
223946	224167	224173	224174	the commissary	13755	’ Book . Mrs General was the daughter of a clerical dignitary in a cathedral town , where she had led the fashion until she was as near forty - five as a single lady can be . A stiff commissariat officer of sixty , famous as a martinet , had then become enamoured of the gravity with which she drove the proprieties four - in - hand through the cathedral town society , and had solicited to be taken beside her on the box of the cool coach of ceremony to which that team was harnessed . His proposal of marriage being accepted by the lady , the commissary took his seat behind the proprieties with great decorum , and Mrs General drove until the commissary died . In the course of their united journey , they ran over several people who came in the way of the proprieties ; but always in a high style and with composure . The commissary having been buried with all the decorations suitable to the service ( the whole team of proprieties were harnessed to his hearse , and they all had feathers and black velvet housings with his coat of arms in the corner ) , Mrs General began to inquire what quantity of dust and ashes was deposited at the bankers ’
224289	224294	224287	224287	she	573	‘ form the mind , ’
224835	224839	224819	224820	Mr Dorrit	353	‘ Mrs General . ’
224906	224912	224914	224915	Mr Dorrit	353	‘ Might I be excused , ’
224917	224926	224914	224915	Mr Dorrit	353	‘ if I inquired -- ha -- what remune-- ’
224927	224932	224934	224935	Mrs General	573	‘ Why , indeed , ’
224941	224997	224934	224935	Mrs General	573	‘ it is a subject on which I prefer to avoid entering . I have never entered on it with my friends here ; and I can not overcome the delicacy , Mr Dorrit , with which I have always regarded it . I am not , as I hope you are aware , a governess-- ’
224998	225003	225005	225006	Mr Dorrit	353	‘ O dear no ! ’
225008	225024	225005	225006	Mr Dorrit	353	‘ Pray , madam , do not imagine for a moment that I think so . ’
225041	225104	225038	225038	her	573	‘ I can not , therefore , put a price upon services which it is a pleasure to me to render if I can render them spontaneously , but which I could not render in mere return for any consideration . Neither do I know how , or where , to find a case parallel to my own . It is peculiar . ’
225124	225130	225132	225133	Mrs General--‘though	577	‘ I can not object , ’
225173	225175	225176	225177	Mr Dorrit	353	’ . ’
225182	225188	225190	225191	Mrs General	573	‘ Permit me to add , ’
225193	225238	225190	225191	Mrs General	573	‘ that beyond this , I can never resume the topic . Also that I can accept no second or inferior position . If the honour were proposed to me of becoming known to Mr Dorrit ’s family -- I think two daughters were mentioned?-- ’
225239	225243	225190	225191	Mrs General	573	‘ Two daughters . ’
225244	225267	225268	225269	Mr Dorrit	353	‘ I could only accept it on terms of perfect equality , as a companion , protector , Mentor , and friend . ’
225304	225308	225310	225311	Mrs General	573	‘ I think , ’
225313	225319	225310	225311	Mrs General	573	‘ two daughters were mentioned ? ’
225320	225324	225326	225327	Mr Dorrit	353	‘ Two daughters , ’
225330	225335	225337	225338	Mrs General	573	‘ It would therefore , ’
225340	225373	225337	225338	Mrs General	573	‘ be necessary to add a third more to the payment ( whatever its amount may prove to be ) , which my friends here have been accustomed to make to my bankers ’
225375	226355	225337	225338	Mrs General	573	’ Mr Dorrit lost no time in referring the delicate question to the county - widower , and finding that he had been accustomed to pay three hundred pounds a - year to the credit of Mrs General , arrived , without any severe strain on his arithmetic , at the conclusion that he himself must pay four . Mrs General being an article of that lustrous surface which suggests that it is worth any money , he made a formal proposal to be allowed to have the honour and pleasure of regarding her as a member of his family . Mrs General conceded that high privilege , and here she was . In person , Mrs General , including her skirts which had much to do with it , was of a dignified and imposing appearance ; ample , rustling , gravely voluminous ; always upright behind the proprieties . She might have been taken -- had been taken -- to the top of the Alps and the bottom of Herculaneum , without disarranging a fold in her dress , or displacing a pin . If her countenance and hair had rather a floury appearance , as though from living in some transcendently genteel Mill , it was rather because she was a chalky creation altogether , than because she mended her complexion with violet powder , or had turned grey . If her eyes had no expression , it was probably because they had nothing to express . If she had few wrinkles , it was because her mind had never traced its name or any other inscription on her face . A cool , waxy , blown - out woman , who had never lighted well . Mrs General had no opinions . Her way of forming a mind was to prevent it from forming opinions . She had a little circular set of mental grooves or rails on which she started little trains of other people ’s opinions , which never overtook one another , and never got anywhere . Even her propriety could not dispute that there was impropriety in the world ; but Mrs General ’s way of getting rid of it was to put it out of sight , and make believe that there was no such thing . This was another of her ways of forming a mind -- to cram all articles of difficulty into cupboards , lock them up , and say they had no existence . It was the easiest way , and , beyond all comparison , the properest . Mrs General was not to be told of anything shocking . Accidents , miseries , and offences , were never to be mentioned before her . Passion was to go to sleep in the presence of Mrs General , and blood was to change to milk and water . The little that was left in the world , when all these deductions were made , it was Mrs General ’s province to varnish . In that formation process of hers , she dipped the smallest of brushes into the largest of pots , and varnished the surface of every object that came under consideration . The more cracked it was , the more Mrs General varnished it . There was varnish in Mrs General ’s voice , varnish in Mrs General ’s touch , an atmosphere of varnish round Mrs General ’s figure . Mrs General ’s dreams ought to have been varnished -- if she had any -- lying asleep in the arms of the good Saint Bernard , with the feathery snow falling on his house - top . CHAPTER 3 . On the Road The bright morning sun dazzled the eyes , the snow had ceased , the mists had vanished , the mountain air was so clear and light that the new sensation of breathing it was like the having entered on a new existence . To help the delusion , the solid ground itself seemed gone , and the mountain , a shining waste of immense white heaps and masses , to be a region of cloud floating between the blue sky above and the earth far below . Some dark specks in the snow , like knots upon a little thread , beginning at the convent door and winding away down the descent in broken lengths which were not yet pieced together , showed where the Brethren were at work in several places clearing the track . Already the snow had begun to be foot - thawed again about the door . Mules were busily brought out , tied to the rings in the wall , and laden ; strings of bells were buckled on , burdens were adjusted , the voices of drivers and riders sounded musically . Some of the earliest had even already resumed their journey ; and , both on the level summit by the dark water near the convent , and on the downward way of yesterday ’s ascent , little moving figures of men and mules , reduced to miniatures by the immensity around , went with a clear tinkling of bells and a pleasant harmony of tongues . In the supper - room of last night , a new fire , piled upon the feathery ashes of the old one , shone upon a homely breakfast of loaves , butter , and milk . It also shone on the courier of the Dorrit family , making tea for his party from a supply he had brought up with him , together with several other small stores which were chiefly laid in for the use of the strong body of inconvenience . Mr Gowan and Blandois of Paris had already breakfasted , and were walking up and down by the lake , smoking their cigars . ‘
226360	226387	226356	226356	Gowan	576	’ muttered Tip , otherwise Edward Dorrit , Esquire , turning over the leaves of the book , when the courier had left them to breakfast . ‘
226451	226452	226443	226443	You	5882	’ ‘
226468	226469	226460	226460	they	5883	’ ‘
226486	226490	226492	226492	he	576	’ said Tip , ‘

226572	226594	226570	226570	Amy	571	’ He asked her the question with a sly glance of observation at Miss Fanny , and at his father too . ‘
226613	226618	226611	226611	Tip	344	’ said Little Dorrit . ‘
226629	226638	226626	226627	Amy child	5887	’ returned that young gentleman with a frown ; ‘
226655	226656	226657	226657	I	0	’ ‘
226687	226688	226717	226717	you	5888	’ ‘
226692	226698	226717	226717	you	5888	’ Miss Fanny struck in . ‘
226746	226747	226738	226738	You	5888	’ ‘
226761	226762	226738	226738	You	5888	’ ‘
226767	226776	226738	226738	You	5888	’ returned that young lady with a flounce . ‘
226781	226790	226793	226793	Fanny	342	’ ( which indeed was the truth ) . ‘
226795	226804	226807	226807	you	342	’ said Mr Dorrit , raising his eyebrows , ‘
226813	226814	226811	226811	yourself	342	’ ‘
226822	226827	226820	226820	Pa	548	’ replied Miss Fanny , ‘
226862	226863	226853	226853	she	571	’ ‘
226867	226878	226853	226853	she	571	’ said Mr Dorrit , turning to his younger daughter , ‘
226893	226894	226853	226853	she	571	’ ‘
226900	226910	226853	226853	she	571	’ Miss Fanny struck in before she could answer , ‘
226957	226958	226953	226954	Mrs Gowan	576	’ ‘
226962	226967	226968	226968	Pa	548	’ inquired her father . ‘
226976	227011	226968	226968	Pa	548	’ returned Miss Fanny , who had by this time succeeded in goading herself into a state of much ill - usage and grievance , which she was often at great pains to do : ‘
227081	227082	227083	227083	Amy	571	’ ‘
227088	227102	227083	227083	Amy	571	’ said Mr Dorrit , tempering a bland severity with a dignified affection , ‘
227108	227118	227083	227083	Amy	571	’ Little Dorrit mildly answered , yes it was . ‘
227123	227128	227083	227083	Amy	571	’ cried Miss Fanny . ‘
227269	227270	227260	227260	I	0	’ ‘
227275	227284	227273	227273	Amy	571	’ observed her brother , shaking his head , ‘
227351	227356	227359	227363	a low - minded thief	5906	’ he added convincingly , ‘
227379	227380	227369	227369	he	5903	’ ‘
227384	227389	227369	227369	he	5903	’ said Miss Fanny , ‘
227467	227472	227464	227465	a policeman	5915	’ said Miss Fanny , ‘
227507	227508	227492	227494	this very Amy	5918	’ ‘
227522	227527	227529	227529	your	5920	’ remarked Mr Edward ; ‘
227544	227545	227546	227546	He	5921	’ ‘
227554	227559	227546	227546	He	5921	’ returned Miss Fanny , ‘
227683	227684	227685	227685	Father	290	’ ‘
227692	227697	227685	227685	Father	290	’ pleaded Little Dorrit . ‘
227722	227723	227713	227713	they	5925	’ ‘
227729	227741	227713	227713	they	5925	’ retorted Fanny , determined not to admit anything in extenuation , ‘
227821	227822	227813	227813	I	0	’ ‘
227831	227836	227823	227823	I	0	’ said Little Dorrit , ‘
227845	227846	227838	227838	you	5923	’ ‘
227856	227861	227854	227854	Amy	571	’ returned her sister . ‘
227947	227973	227974	227975	My dear	969	’ Mr Dorrit now interposed , at once to stop these painful subjects by his authority , and to point their moral by his wisdom . ‘
227977	227985	227974	227975	My dear	969	’ said he to his younger daughter , ‘
228159	228160	228125	228125	your	969	’ ‘
228168	228173	228125	228125	your	969	’ cried Miss Fanny . ‘
228181	228182	228183	228183	Fanny	342	’ ‘
228185	228192	228183	228183	Fanny	342	’ returned her father , grandiloquently , ‘
228347	228357	228364	228365	Mr Clennam	304	’ here Mr Dorrit became extremely grave and impressive , ‘
228494	229849	228491	228492	Mrs General	5837	’ The entrance of the lady whom he announced , to take her place at the breakfast - table , terminated the discussion . Shortly afterwards , the courier announced that the valet , and the footman , and the two maids , and the four guides , and the fourteen mules , were in readiness ; so the breakfast party went out to the convent door to join the cavalcade . Mr Gowan stood aloof with his cigar and pencil , but Mr Blandois was on the spot to pay his respects to the ladies . When he gallantly pulled off his slouched hat to Little Dorrit , she thought he had even a more sinister look , standing swart and cloaked in the snow , than he had in the fire - light over - night . But , as both her father and her sister received his homage with some favour , she refrained from expressing any distrust of him , lest it should prove to be a new blemish derived from her prison birth . Nevertheless , as they wound down the rugged way while the convent was yet in sight , she more than once looked round , and descried Mr Blandois , backed by the convent smoke which rose straight and high from the chimneys in a golden film , always standing on one jutting point looking down after them . Long after he was a mere black stick in the snow , she felt as though she could yet see that smile of his , that high nose , and those eyes that were too near it . And even after that , when the convent was gone and some light morning clouds veiled the pass below it , the ghastly skeleton arms by the wayside seemed to be all pointing up at him . More treacherous than snow , perhaps , colder at heart , and harder to melt , Blandois of Paris by degrees passed out of her mind , as they came down into the softer regions . Again the sun was warm , again the streams descending from glaciers and snowy caverns were refreshing to drink at , again they came among the pine - trees , the rocky rivulets , the verdant heights and dales , the wooden chalets and rough zigzag fences of Swiss country . Sometimes the way so widened that she and her father could ride abreast . And then to look at him , handsomely clothed in his fur and broadcloths , rich , free , numerously served and attended , his eyes roving far away among the glories of the landscape , no miserable screen before them to darken his sight and cast its shadow on him , was enough . Her uncle was so far rescued from that shadow of old , that he wore the clothes they gave him , and performed some ablutions as a sacrifice to the family credit , and went where he was taken , with a certain patient animal enjoyment , which seemed to express that the air and change did him good . In all other respects , save one , he shone with no light but such as was reflected from his brother . His brother ’s greatness , wealth , freedom , and grandeur , pleased him without any reference to himself . Silent and retiring , he had no use for speech when he could hear his brother speak ; no desire to be waited on , so that the servants devoted themselves to his brother . The only noticeable change he originated in himself , was an alteration in his manner to his younger niece . Every day it refined more and more into a marked respect , very rarely shown by age to youth , and still more rarely susceptible , one would have said , of the fitness with which he invested it . On those occasions when Miss Fanny did declare once for all , he would take the next opportunity of baring his grey head before his younger niece , and of helping her to alight , or handing her to the carriage , or showing her any other attention , with the profoundest deference . Yet it never appeared misplaced or forced , being always heartily simple , spontaneous , and genuine . Neither would he ever consent , even at his brother ’s request , to be helped to any place before her , or to take precedence of her in anything . So jealous was he of her being respected , that , on this very journey down from the Great Saint Bernard , he took sudden and violent umbrage at the footman ’s being remiss to hold her stirrup , though standing near when she dismounted ; and unspeakably astonished the whole retinue by charging at him on a hard - headed mule , riding him into a corner , and threatening to trample him to death . They were a goodly company , and the Innkeepers all but worshipped them . Wherever they went , their importance preceded them in the person of the courier riding before , to see that the rooms of state were ready . He was the herald of the family procession . The great travelling - carriage came next : containing , inside , Mr Dorrit , Miss Dorrit , Miss Amy Dorrit , and Mrs General ; outside , some of the retainers , and ( in fine weather ) Edward Dorrit , Esquire , for whom the box was reserved . Then came the chariot containing Frederick Dorrit , Esquire , and an empty place occupied by Edward Dorrit , Esquire , in wet weather . Then came the fourgon with the rest of the retainers , the heavy baggage , and as much as it could carry of the mud and dust which the other vehicles left behind . These equipages adorned the yard of the hotel at Martigny , on the return of the family from their mountain excursion . Other vehicles were there , much company being on the road , from the patched Italian Vettura -- like the body of a swing from an English fair put upon a wooden tray on wheels , and having another wooden tray without wheels put atop of it -- to the trim English carriage . But there was another adornment of the hotel which Mr Dorrit had not bargained for . Two strange travellers embellished one of his rooms . The Innkeeper , hat in hand in the yard , swore to the courier that he was blighted , that he was desolated , that he was profoundly afflicted , that he was the most miserable and unfortunate of beasts , that he had the head of a wooden pig . He ought never to have made the concession , he said , but the very genteel lady had so passionately prayed him for the accommodation of that room to dine in , only for a little half - hour , that he had been vanquished . The little half - hour was expired , the lady and gentleman were taking their little dessert and half - cup of coffee , the note was paid , the horses were ordered , they would depart immediately ; but , owing to an unhappy destiny and the curse of Heaven , they were not yet gone . Nothing could exceed Mr Dorrit ’s indignation , as he turned at the foot of the staircase on hearing these apologies . He felt that the family dignity was struck at by an assassin ’s hand . He had a sense of his dignity , which was of the most exquisite nature . He could detect a design upon it when nobody else had any perception of the fact . His life was made an agony by the number of fine scalpels that he felt to be incessantly engaged in dissecting his dignity . ‘
229856	229864	229854	229854	sir	933	’ said Mr Dorrit , reddening excessively , ‘
229888	229953	229866	229866	you	933	’ Thousands of pardons ! It was the host ’s profound misfortune to have been overcome by that too genteel lady . He besought Monseigneur not to enrage himself . He threw himself on Monseigneur for clemency . If Monseigneur would have the distinguished goodness to occupy the other salon especially reserved for him , for but five minutes , all would go well . ‘
229958	229963	229956	229956	sir	933	’ said Mr Dorrit . ‘
230010	230071	230000	230000	you	933	’ Alas ! The host called all the universe to witness that Monseigneur was the most amiable of the whole body of nobility , the most important , the most estimable , the most honoured . If he separated Monseigneur from others , it was only because he was more distinguished , more cherished , more generous , more renowned . ‘
230080	230090	230000	230000	you	933	’ returned Mr Dorrit , in a mighty heat . ‘
230110	230152	230108	230108	yourself	933	’ Ah , just Heaven , then , how could the host explain himself when he had nothing more to explain ; when he had only to apologise , and confide himself to the so well - known magnanimity of Monseigneur ! ‘
230159	230168	230153	230153	I	0	’ said Mr Dorrit , panting with anger , ‘
230224	230294	230217	230217	sir	933	’ Permit the landlord humbly to submit to Monsieur the Courier then , that Monseigneur , ordinarily so gracious , enraged himself without cause . There was no why . Monsieur the Courier would represent to Monseigneur , that he deceived himself in suspecting that there was any why , but the why his devoted servant had already had the honour to present to him . The very genteel lady-- ‘
230297	230302	230217	230217	sir	933	’ cried Mr Dorrit . ‘
230386	230671	230673	230673	your	5972	’ No one had interfered in the dispute , which was beyond the French colloquial powers of Edward Dorrit , Esquire , and scarcely within the province of the ladies . Miss Fanny , however , now supported her father with great bitterness ; declaring , in her native tongue , that it was quite clear there was something special in this man ’s impertinence ; and that she considered it important that he should be , by some means , forced to give up his authority for making distinctions between that family and other wealthy families . What the reasons of his presumption could be , she was at a loss to imagine ; but reasons he must have , and they ought to be torn from him . All the guides , mule - drivers , and idlers in the yard , had made themselves parties to the angry conference , and were much impressed by the courier ’s now bestirring himself to get the carriages out . With the aid of some dozen people to each wheel , this was done at a great cost of noise ; and then the loading was proceeded with , pending the arrival of the horses from the post - house . But the very genteel lady ’s English chariot being already horsed and at the inn - door , the landlord had slipped up - stairs to represent his hard case . This was notified to the yard by his now coming down the staircase in attendance on the gentleman and the lady , and by his pointing out the offended majesty of Mr Dorrit to them with a significant motion of his hand . ‘
230676	230691	230673	230673	your	5972	’ said the gentleman , detaching himself from the lady , and coming forward . ‘
230742	230771	230737	230737	she	5975	’ Mr Dorrit , still panting under his injury , saluted the gentleman , and saluted the lady , in a distant , final , and invincible manner . ‘
230784	230810	230782	230782	you	5977	’ This was the gentleman ’s way of appealing to Edward Dorrit , Esquire , on whom he pounced as a great and providential relief . ‘
230830	230853	230822	230822	Lady	5978	’ Edward Dorrit , Esquire , led a little apart by the button , assumed a diplomatic expression of countenance in replying , ‘

230888	230891	230893	230894	the other	9761	‘ No , ’

Being a remarkably fine woman with no bigodd nonsense about her -- well educated , too -- she was too many for this chap . Regularly pocketed him . ’

I had no idea the rightful owner would come back so soon , nor had I any idea that he had come back , or I should have hastened to make restoration of my ill - gotten chamber , and to have offered my explanation and apology . I trust in saying this-- ’

236630	236637	236611	236611	her	573	‘ There is a great difference . ’
236638	236651	236653	236654	Mr Dorrit	578	‘ May I ask to be favoured with your view of it ? ’

236848	236857	236859	236860	Mr Dorrit	578	‘ Will you be kind enough , madam , ’
236862	236891	236859	236860	Mr Dorrit	578	‘ to be -- ha -- more explicit ? I do not quite understand my elder daughter ’s having -- hum -- too much material . What material ? ’
236892	236895	236897	236898	Mrs General	573	‘ Fanny , ’
236900	236918	236897	236898	Mrs General	573	‘ at present forms too many opinions . Perfect breeding forms none , and is never demonstrative . ’
236936	236945	236930	236931	Mr Dorrit	578	‘ Unquestionably , madam , you are right . ’
236957	236962	236946	236947	Mrs General	573	‘ I believe so . ’

237286	237294	237284	237284	madam	4777	’ observed Mr Dorrit , rather quickly . ‘

237354	237359	237352	237352	madam	4777	’ said Mr Dorrit , ‘
237364	237395	237396	237396	I	0	’ ( he laid an emphasis on the phrase and repeated it , as though he stipulated , with urbane firmness , that he must not be contradicted again ) , ‘
237424	237425	237419	237419	you	4777	’ ‘
237429	237434	237426	237427	Mr Dorrit	578	’ returned Mrs General , ‘

237602	237607	237600	237600	madam	4777	’ said Mr Dorrit , ‘

237644	237649	237640	237640	I	0	’ returned Mrs General , ‘

237747	237754	237744	237745	Mr Dorrit	578	’ said Mrs General , graciously . ‘
237760	237761	237744	237745	Mr Dorrit	578	’ ‘
237770	237784	237768	237768	madam	4777	’ resumed Mr Dorrit , ringing his little bell to summon his valet , ‘

237829	238064	237814	237814	you	578	’ So , Tinkler the valet was instructed to find Miss Amy ’s maid , and to request that subordinate to inform Miss Amy that Mr Dorrit wished to see her in his own room . In delivering this charge to Tinkler , Mr Dorrit looked severely at him , and also kept a jealous eye upon him until he went out at the door , mistrusting that he might have something in his mind prejudicial to the family dignity ; that he might have even got wind of some Collegiate joke before he came into the service , and might be derisively reviving its remembrance at the present moment . If Tinkler had happened to smile , however faintly and innocently , nothing would have persuaded Mr Dorrit , to the hour of his death , but that this was the case . As Tinkler happened , however , very fortunately for himself , to be of a serious and composed countenance , he escaped the secret danger that threatened him . And as on his return -- when Mr Dorrit eyed him again -- he announced Miss Amy as if she had come to a funeral , he left a vague impression on Mr Dorrit ’s mind that he was a well - conducted young fellow , who had been brought up in the study of his Catechism by a widowed mother . ‘
238067	238072	238065	238065	Amy	349	’ said Mr Dorrit , ‘

238234	238239	238213	238213	Papa	407	’ said Mr Dorrit , ‘
238251	238270	238271	238271	You	1683	’ Poor Little Dorrit , with a rather forlorn glance at that eminent varnisher , promised to try . ‘

238293	238297	238271	238271	You	1683	’ Another pause . ‘
238313	238365	238366	238366	Amy	349	’ said Little Dorrit , with her loving eyes upon her father ; whom she had very nearly addressed as poultry , if not prunes and prism too , in her desire to submit herself to Mrs General and please him . Mr Dorrit frowned , and looked anything but pleased . ‘
238368	238372	238366	238366	Amy	349	’ he returned , ‘

238611	238636	238637	238637	I	0	’ Mr Dorrit was even a little more fragmentary than usual , being excited on the subject and anxious to make himself particularly emphatic . ‘
238641	238645	238637	238637	I	0	’ he repeated , ‘
238688	238714	238685	238686	Mrs General	573	’ That lady shut her eyes again , on being again referred to ; then , slowly opening them and rising , added these words : ‘
238865	239270	239275	239275	you	6279	’ Having delivered this exalted sentiment , Mrs General made a sweeping obeisance , and retired with an expression of mouth indicative of Prunes and Prism . Little Dorrit , whether speaking or silent , had preserved her quiet earnestness and her loving look . It had not been clouded , except for a passing moment , until now . But now that she was left alone with him the fingers of her lightly folded hands were agitated , and there was repressed emotion in her face . Not for herself . She might feel a little wounded , but her care was not for herself . Her thoughts still turned , as they always had turned , to him . A faint misgiving , which had hung about her since their accession to fortune , that even now she could never see him as he used to be before the prison days , had gradually begun to assume form in her mind . She felt that , in what he had just now said to her and in his whole bearing towards her , there was the well - known shadow of the Marshalsea wall . It took a new shape , but it was the old sad shadow . She began with sorrowful unwillingness to acknowledge to herself that she was not strong enough to keep off the fear that no space in the life of man could overcome that quarter of a century behind the prison bars . She had no blame to bestow upon him , therefore : nothing to reproach him with , no emotions in her faithful heart but great compassion and unbounded tenderness . This is why it was , that , even as he sat before her on his sofa , in the brilliant light of a bright Italian day , the wonderful city without and the splendours of an old palace within , she saw him at the moment in the long - familiar gloom of his Marshalsea lodging , and wished to take her seat beside him , and comfort him , and be again full of confidence with him , and of usefulness to him . If he divined what was in her thoughts , his own were not in tune with it . After some uneasy moving in his seat , he got up and walked about , looking very much dissatisfied . ‘

239518	239548	239498	239498	Amy	349	’ She laid her hand on his arm . She did nothing more . She gently touched him . The trembling hand may have said , with some expression , ‘
239565	239619	239620	239620	I	0	’ But she said not a syllable herself . There was a reproach in the touch so addressed to him that she had not foreseen , or she would have withheld her hand . He began to justify himself in a heated , stumbling , angry manner , which made nothing of it . ‘
239706	239735	239697	239697	I	0	’ He did not once look at her , as he rambled on in this way ; but gesticulated at , and appealed to , the empty air . ‘
239842	239868	239871	239871	they	10846	’ In spite of his flustered state , he made all these exclamations in a carefully suppressed voice , lest the valet should overhear anything . ‘
239984	240002	240003	240003	I	0	’ Notwithstanding which , he continued to defend himself , without any abatement of his flushed mood . ‘
240083	240107	240108	240108	I	0	’ This last consideration plainly appeared , from his manner of pursuing it , to have just that instant come into his head . ‘
240330	240469	240311	240312	Mrs General	573	’ He had been running down by jerks , during his last speech , like a sort of ill - adjusted alarum . The touch was still upon his arm . He fell silent ; and after looking about the ceiling again for a little while , looked down at her . Her head drooped , and he could not see her face ; but her touch was tender and quiet , and in the expression of her dejected figure there was no blame -- nothing but love . He began to whimper , just as he had done that night in the prison when she afterwards sat at his bedside till morning ; exclaimed that he was a poor ruin and a poor wretch in the midst of his wealth ; and clasped her in his arms . ‘
240481	240620	240311	240312	Mrs General	573	’ was all she said to him . His tears were soon dried , much sooner than on the former occasion ; and he was presently afterwards very high with his valet , as a way of righting himself for having shed any . With one remarkable exception , to be recorded in its place , this was the only time , in his life of freedom and fortune , when he spoke to his daughter Amy of the old days . But , now , the breakfast hour arrived ; and with it Miss Fanny from her apartment , and Mr Edward from his apartment . Both these young persons of distinction were something the worse for late hours . As to Miss Fanny , she had become the victim of an insatiate mania for what she called ‘
240625	241149	241150	241150	I	0	’ and would have gone into it head - foremost fifty times between sunset and sunrise , if so many opportunities had been at her disposal . As to Mr Edward , he , too , had a large acquaintance , and was generally engaged ( for the most part , in diceing circles , or others of a kindred nature ) , during the greater part of every night . For this gentleman , when his fortunes changed , had stood at the great advantage of being already prepared for the highest associates , and having little to learn : so much was he indebted to the happy accidents which had made him acquainted with horse - dealing and billiard - marking . At breakfast , Mr Frederick Dorrit likewise appeared . As the old gentleman inhabited the highest story of the palace , where he might have practised pistol - shooting without much chance of discovery by the other inmates , his younger niece had taken courage to propose the restoration to him of his clarionet , which Mr Dorrit had ordered to be confiscated , but which she had ventured to preserve . Notwithstanding some objections from Miss Fanny , that it was a low instrument , and that she detested the sound of it , the concession had been made . But it was then discovered that he had had enough of it , and never played it , now that it was no longer his means of getting bread . He had insensibly acquired a new habit of shuffling into the picture - galleries , always with his twisted paper of snuff in his hand ( much to the indignation of Miss Fanny , who had proposed the purchase of a gold box for him that the family might not be discredited , which he had absolutely refused to carry when it was bought ) ; and of passing hours and hours before the portraits of renowned Venetians . It was never made out what his dazed eyes saw in them ; whether he had an interest in them merely as pictures , or whether he confusedly identified them with a glory that was departed , like the strength of his own mind . But he paid his court to them with great exactness , and clearly derived pleasure from the pursuit . After the first few days , Little Dorrit happened one morning to assist at these attentions . It so evidently heightened his gratification that she often accompanied him afterwards , and the greatest delight of which the old man had shown himself susceptible since his ruin , arose out of these excursions , when he would carry a chair about for her from picture to picture , and stand behind it , in spite of all her remonstrances , silently presenting her to the noble Venetians . It fell out that , at this family breakfast , he referred to their having seen in a gallery , on the previous day , the lady and gentleman whom they had encountered on the Great Saint Bernard , ‘
241155	241159	241150	241150	I	0	’ said he . ‘
241177	241178	241180	241180	I	0	’ ‘
241183	241188	241190	241191	the latter	1268	‘ em well enough , ’
241193	241199	241201	241202	Miss Fanny	342	‘ I should think so , ’
241217	241241	241208	241208	her	342	‘ But they would not have been recalled to our remembrance , I suspect , if Uncle had n’t tumbled over the subject . ’
241242	241251	241253	241254	Mrs General	573	‘ My dear , what a curious phrase , ’
241256	241271	241253	241254	Mrs General	573	‘ Would not inadvertently lighted upon , or accidentally referred to , be better ? ’
241272	241281	241283	241285	the young lady	1678	‘ Thank you very much , Mrs General , ’
241287	241303	241283	241285	the young lady	1678	‘ no , I think not . On the whole I prefer my own expression . ’
241336	241351	241353	241354	Little Dorrit	274	‘ I should have mentioned our having met Mr and Mrs Gowan , Fanny , ’
241356	241412	241353	241354	Little Dorrit	274	‘ even if Uncle had not . I have scarcely seen you since , you know . I meant to have spoken of it at breakfast ; because I should like to pay a visit to Mrs Gowan , and to become better acquainted with her , if Papa and Mrs General do not object . ’
241413	241418	241420	241420	Fanny	342	‘ Well , Amy , ’
241422	241461	241420	241420	Fanny	342	‘ I am sure I am glad to find you at last expressing a wish to become better acquainted with anybody in Venice . Though whether Mr and Mrs Gowan are desirable acquaintances , remains to be determined . ’
241462	241471	241353	241354	Little Dorrit	274	‘ Mrs Gowan I spoke of , dear . ’
241472	241476	241478	241478	Fanny	342	‘ No doubt , ’
241480	241500	241478	241478	Fanny	342	‘ But you ca n’t separate her from her husband , I believe , without an Act of Parliament . ’
241501	241508	241510	241511	Little Dorrit	274	‘ Do you think , Papa , ’
241518	241529	241510	241511	Little Dorrit	274	‘ there is any objection to my making this visit ? ’
241530	241533	241534	241534	he	6320	‘ Really , ’
241537	241549	241534	241534	he	6320	‘ I -- ha -- what is Mrs General ’s view ? ’
241701	241754	241690	241690	his	578	‘ I say -- you there ! Go out , will you!’--which was addressed to a couple of men who were handing the dishes round , as a courteous intimation that their services could be temporarily dispensed with . Those menials having obeyed the mandate , Edward Dorrit , Esquire , proceeded . ‘
241806	241807	241810	241810	I	0	’ ‘
241814	241820	241810	241810	I	0	’ observed the fair varnisher , ‘
241838	241839	241833	241837	people of importance and consideration--	6333	’ ‘
241844	241851	241833	241837	people of importance and consideration--	6333	’ said Edward Dorrit , Esquire , ‘
241876	241877	241878	241880	The great Merdle	464	’ ‘
241882	241887	241878	241880	The great Merdle	464	’ exclaimed Mrs General . ‘
241893	241900	241889	241891	The _ Merdle	464	’ said Edward Dorrit , Esquire . ‘
241939	241940	241928	241928	I	0	’ ‘
241953	241981	241928	241928	I	0	’ said Mrs General to Mr Dorrit , raising her gloves and bowing her head , as if she were doing homage to some visible graven image . ‘
241997	242010	242055	242056	Mrs Merdle	464	’ Mr Dorrit observed , with a decided change in his manner , ‘
242023	242024	242012	242012	he	10024	’ ‘
242034	242041	242032	242032	sir	933	’ returned Edward Dorrit , Esquire , ‘
242073	242074	242075	242075	Martigny	190	’ ‘
242077	242088	242089	242089	Martigny	190	’ interposed Miss Fanny with an air of infinite languor . ‘
242091	242120	242089	242089	Martigny	190	’ assented her brother , with a slight nod and a slight wink ; in acknowledgment of which , Miss Fanny looked surprised , and laughed and reddened . ‘
242128	242133	242134	242134	You	343	’ said Mr Dorrit . ‘
242165	242166	242172	242172	father	1100	’ ‘
242268	242285	242263	242266	a certain young lady	6349	’ Here Edward Dorrit , Esquire , eyed Miss Fanny through his glass across the table . ‘
242310	242359	242308	242308	himself	472	’ Here he ceased ; continuing to eye Miss Fanny through his glass , with a face much twisted , and not ornamentally so , in part by the action of keeping his glass in his eye , and in part by the great subtlety of his smile . ‘
242364	242369	242370	242370	I	0	’ said Mr Dorrit , ‘
242427	242439	242417	242417	I	0	’ said Mr Dorrit , in an encouraging and forgiving manner , ‘
242550	242672	242673	242673	Brother	473	’ This magnificent accordance of Mr Dorrit ’s recognition settled the matter . It was not observed that Uncle had pushed away his plate , and forgotten his breakfast ; but he was not much observed at any time , except by Little Dorrit . The servants were recalled , and the meal proceeded to its conclusion . Mrs General rose and left the table . Little Dorrit rose and left the table . When Edward and Fanny remained whispering together across it , and when Mr Dorrit remained eating figs and reading a French newspaper , Uncle suddenly fixed the attention of all three by rising out of his chair , striking his hand upon the table , and saying , ‘
242680	242732	242733	242733	Brother	473	’ If he had made a proclamation in an unknown tongue , and given up the ghost immediately afterwards , he could not have astounded his audience more . The paper fell from Mr Dorrit ’s hand , and he sat petrified , with a fig half way to his mouth . ‘
242735	242750	242751	242751	I	0	’ said the old man , conveying a surprising energy into his trembling voice , ‘
242816	242889	242811	242811	I	0	’ It was extraordinary to see of what a burst of earnestness such a decrepit man was capable . His eyes became bright , his grey hair rose on his head , markings of purpose on his brow and face which had faded from them for five - and - twenty years , started out again , and there was an energy in his hand that made its action nervous once more . ‘
242894	242900	242811	242811	I	0	’ exclaimed Mr Dorrit faintly . ‘
242910	242911	242914	242914	you	473	’ ‘
242916	242927	242930	242930	you	473	’ said the old man , turning round on Fanny , ‘
242944	242945	242946	242946	Uncle	10345	’ ‘
242948	242958	242961	242961	you	10345	’ cried Fanny , affrighted and bursting into tears , ‘
242974	242975	242971	242971	I	0	’ ‘
242978	242991	242971	242971	I	0	’ returned the old man , pointing to her sister ’s place , ‘
243037	243038	243039	243039	I	0	’ ‘
243043	243052	243041	243041	Amy	349	’ cried Miss Fanny , sobbing and weeping , ‘

243135	243147	243148	243148	Brother	473	’ cried the old man , with great scorn and indignation . ‘
243243	243271	243283	243283	He	0	’ As his hand went up above his head and came down on the table , it might have been a blacksmith ’s . After a few moments ’
243310	243334	243283	243283	He	0	‘ William , my dear , I felt obliged to say it ; forgive me , for I felt obliged to say it ! ’
243427	243438	243439	243439	she	342	‘ I never , never , never was so used ! ’
243442	243508	243439	243439	she	342	‘ There never was anything so harsh and unjustifiable , so disgracefully violent and cruel ! Dear , kind , quiet little Amy , too , what would she feel if she could know that she had been innocently the means of exposing me to such treatment ! But I ’ll never tell her ! No , good darling , I ’ll never tell her ! ’
243518	243522	243524	243524	he	578	‘ My dear , ’
243526	243593	243524	243524	he	578	‘ I -- ha -- approve of your resolution . It will be -- ha hum -- much better not to speak of this to Amy . It might -- hum -- it might distress her . Ha . No doubt it would distress her greatly . It is considerate and right to avoid doing so . We will -- ha -- keep this to ourselves . ’
243594	243601	243603	243604	Miss Fanny	342	‘ But the cruelty of Uncle ! ’
243606	243619	243603	243604	Miss Fanny	342	‘ O , I never can forgive the wanton cruelty of Uncle ! ’
243620	243624	243626	243627	Mr Dorrit	578	‘ My dear , ’
243639	243685	243634	243634	he	578	‘ I must request you not to say so . You must remember that your uncle is -- ha -- not what he formerly was . You must remember that your uncle ’s state requires -- hum -- great forbearance from us , great forbearance . ’
243686	243691	243693	243693	Fanny	342	‘ I am sure , ’
243697	243731	243693	243693	Fanny	342	‘ it is only charitable to suppose that there must be something wrong in him somewhere , or he never could have so attacked Me , of all the people in the world . ’
243732	243735	243737	243738	Mr Dorrit	578	‘ Fanny , ’
243745	243809	243737	243738	Mr Dorrit	578	‘ you know , with his innumerable good points , what a -- hum -- wreck your uncle is ; and , I entreat you by the fondness that I have for him , and by the fidelity that you know I have always shown him , to -- ha -- to draw your own conclusions , and to spare my brotherly feelings . ’
244155	244187	244145	244145	he	576	‘ My good fellow , what do we all turn out but trash ? _ I _ turn out nothing else , and I make you a present of the confession . ’
244519	244528	244535	244536	the oracle	6396	‘ Tails , kick ; heads , encourage , ’
245117	245124	245114	245114	Fanny	342	‘ fearfully out of the way , ’
245144	245148	245139	245141	the same lady	6421	‘ mere ditches . ’
245619	245625	245627	245627	Fanny	342	‘ Papa was extremely sorry , ’
245629	245702	245704	245704	she	342	‘ to be engaged to - day ( he is so much engaged here , our acquaintance being so wretchedly large ! ) ; and particularly requested me to bring his card for Mr Gowan . That I may be sure to acquit myself of a commission which he impressed upon me at least a dozen times , allow me to relieve my conscience by placing it on the table at once . ’
245710	245715	245717	245717	Fanny	342	‘ We have been , ’
245719	245741	245717	245717	Fanny	342	‘ charmed to understand that you know the Merdles . We hope it may be another means of bringing us together . ’
245742	245747	245749	245750	Mrs Gowan	576	‘ They are friends , ’
245752	245786	245749	245750	Mrs Gowan	576	‘ of Mr Gowan ’s family . I have not yet had the pleasure of a personal introduction to Mrs Merdle , but I suppose I shall be presented to her at Rome . ’
245787	245790	245792	245792	Fanny	342	‘ Indeed ? ’
245804	245812	245792	245792	Fanny	342	‘ I think you ’ll like her . ’
245813	245820	245749	245750	Mrs Gowan	576	‘ You know her very well ? ’
245821	245827	245829	245829	Fanny	342	‘ Why , you see , ’
245840	245903	245829	245829	Fanny	342	‘ in London one knows every one . We met her on our way here , and , to say the truth , papa was at first rather cross with her for taking one of the rooms that our people had ordered for us . However , of course , that soon blew over , and we were all good friends again . ’
245994	246001	246002	246002	she	342	‘ You have been quite well , ’
246006	246011	246002	246002	she	342	‘ since that night ? ’
246012	246021	246060	246061	Mrs Gowan	576	‘ Quite , my dear . And you ? ’
246022	246030	246032	246033	Little Dorrit	585	‘ Oh ! I am always well , ’
246037	246045	246032	246033	Little Dorrit	585	‘ I -- yes , thank you . ’
246095	246122	246124	246125	Mrs Gowan	576	‘ You do n’t know that you are a favourite of my husband ’s , and that I am almost bound to be jealous of you ? ’
246136	246166	246127	246128	Little Dorrit	585	‘ He will tell you , if he tells you what he tells me , that you are quieter and quicker of resource than any one he ever saw . ’
246167	246176	246178	246179	Little Dorrit	585	‘ He speaks far too well of me , ’
246181	246241	246178	246179	Little Dorrit	585	‘ I doubt that ; but I do n’t at all doubt that I must tell him you are here . I should never be forgiven , if I were to let you -- and Miss Dorrit -- go , without doing so . May I ? You can excuse the disorder and discomfort of a painter ’s studio ? ’
246279	246288	246290	246290	she	342	‘ Do Henry the favour to come in , ’
246292	246300	246290	246290	she	342	‘ I knew he would be pleased ! ’
246370	246376	246378	246378	Gowan	576	‘ Do n’t be alarmed , ’
246388	246432	246378	246378	Gowan	576	‘ It ’s only Blandois . He is doing duty as a model to - day . I am making a study of him . It saves me money to turn him to some use . We poor painters have none to spare . ’
246453	246458	246460	246460	he	537	‘ A thousand pardons ! ’
246462	246480	246460	246460	he	537	‘ But the Professore here is so inexorable with me , that I am afraid to stir . ’
246481	246488	246490	246490	Gowan	576	‘ Do n’t stir , then , ’
246500	246576	246490	246490	Gowan	576	‘ Let the ladies at least see the original of the daub , that they may know what it ’s meant for . There he stands , you see . A bravo waiting for his prey , a distinguished noble waiting to save his country , the common enemy waiting to do somebody a bad turn , an angelic messenger waiting to do somebody a good turn -- whatever you think he looks most like ! ’
246577	246595	246597	246597	Blandois	537	‘ Say , Professore Mio , a poor gentleman waiting to do homage to elegance and beauty , ’
246599	246607	246609	246609	Gowan	576	‘ Or say , Cattivo Soggetto Mio , ’
246628	246654	246655	246655	Blandois	537	‘ a murderer after the fact . Show that white hand of yours , Blandois . Put it outside the cloak . Keep it still . ’
246656	246672	246673	246673	He	537	’ hand was unsteady ; but he laughed , and that would naturally shake it . ‘
246691	246711	246673	246673	He	537	’ said Gowan , putting in the markings of the hand with a quick , impatient , unskilful touch , ‘
246735	246877	246731	246731	you	6455	’ Blandois of Paris shook with a laugh again , so that his hand shook more ; now he raised it to twist his moustache , which had a damp appearance ; and now he stood in the required position , with a little new swagger . His face was so directed in reference to the spot where Little Dorrit stood by the easel , that throughout he looked at her . Once attracted by his peculiar eyes , she could not remove her own , and they had looked at each other all the time . She trembled now ; Gowan , feeling it , and supposing her to be alarmed by the large dog beside him , whose head she caressed in her hand , and who had just uttered a low growl , glanced at her to say , ‘
246887	246888	246884	246885	Miss Dorrit	349	’ ‘
246896	246904	246889	246889	I	0	’ she returned in the same breath ; ‘
246912	246934	246907	246907	you	6458	’ In a moment Gowan had thrown down his brush , and seized the dog with both hands by the collar . ‘
246979	247028	247029	247029	Lion	438	’ The great dog , regardless of being half - choked by his collar , was obdurately pulling with his dead weight against his master , resolved to get across the room . He had been crouching for a spring at the moment when his master caught him . ‘
247033	247052	247031	247031	Lion	438	’ He was up on his hind legs , and it was a wrestle between master and dog . ‘
247077	247078	247079	247079	I	0	’ ‘
247086	247087	247079	247079	I	0	’ ‘
247117	247189	247112	247112	he	438	’ The dog , with a ferocious bark , made one other struggle as Blandois vanished ; then , in the moment of the dog ’s submission , the master , little less angry than the dog , felled him with a blow on the head , and standing over him , struck him many times severely with the heel of his boot , so that his mouth was presently bloody . ‘
247200	247204	247206	247206	I	0	’ said Gowan , ‘
247215	247274	247206	247206	I	0	’ Lion did as he was ordered , and lay down licking his mouth and chest . Lion ’s master stopped for a moment to take breath , and then , recovering his usual coolness of manner , turned to speak to his frightened wife and her visitors . Probably the whole occurrence had not occupied two minutes . ‘
247339	247402	247322	247322	you	430	’ Minnie was too much disturbed to say anything connected in reply ; Little Dorrit was already occupied in soothing her ; Fanny , who had cried out twice or thrice , held Gowan ’s arm for protection ; Lion , deeply ashamed of having caused them this alarm , came trailing himself along the ground to the feet of his mistress . ‘
247407	247418	247403	247403	You	537	’ said Gowan , striking him with his foot again . ‘
247426	247437	247419	247419	You	537	’ And he struck him again , and yet again . ‘
247448	247453	247419	247419	You	537	’ cried Little Dorrit . ‘
247465	247939	247419	247419	You	537	’ At her entreaty , Gowan spared him ; and he deserved her intercession , for truly he was as submissive , and as sorry , and as wretched as a dog could be . It was not easy to recover this shock and make the visit unrestrained , even though Fanny had not been , under the best of circumstances , the least trifle in the way . In such further communication as passed among them before the sisters took their departure , Little Dorrit fancied it was revealed to her that Mr Gowan treated his wife , even in his very fondness , too much like a beautiful child . He seemed so unsuspicious of the depths of feeling which she knew must lie below that surface , that she doubted if there could be any such depths in himself . She wondered whether his want of earnestness might be the natural result of his want of such qualities , and whether it was with people as with ships , that , in too shallow and rocky waters , their anchors had no hold , and they drifted anywhere . He attended them down the staircase , jocosely apologising for the poor quarters to which such poor fellows as himself were limited , and remarking that when the high and mighty Barnacles , his relatives , who would be dreadfully ashamed of them , presented him with better , he would live in better to oblige them . At the water ’s edge they were saluted by Blandois , who looked white enough after his late adventure , but who made very light of it notwithstanding,--laughing at the mention of Lion . Leaving the two together under the scrap of vine upon the causeway , Gowan idly scattering the leaves from it into the water , and Blandois lighting a cigarette , the sisters were paddled away in state as they had come . They had not glided on for many minutes , when Little Dorrit became aware that Fanny was more showy in manner than the occasion appeared to require , and , looking about for the cause through the window and through the open door , saw another gondola evidently in waiting on them . As this gondola attended their progress in various artful ways ; sometimes shooting on a - head , and stopping to let them pass ; sometimes , when the way was broad enough , skimming along side by side with them ; and sometimes following close astern ; and as Fanny gradually made no disguise that she was playing off graces upon somebody within it , of whom she at the same time feigned to be unconscious ; Little Dorrit at length asked who it was ? To which Fanny made the short answer , ‘
247943	247944	247419	247419	You	537	’ ‘
247947	247952	247953	247955	My dear child	11646	’ said Little Dorrit . ‘
247957	247983	247953	247955	My dear child	11646	’ returned Fanny ( in a tone suggesting that before her Uncle ’s protest she might have said , You little fool , instead ) , ‘
247992	248051	247989	247990	Young Sparkler	595	’ She lowered the window on her side , and , leaning back and resting her elbow on it negligently , fanned herself with a rich Spanish fan of black and gold . The attendant gondola , having skimmed forward again , with some swift trace of an eye in the window , Fanny laughed coquettishly and said , ‘
248063	248064	248056	248058	such a fool	6463	’ ‘
248077	248082	248068	248068	he	6463	’ asked Little Dorrit . ‘
248087	248091	248068	248068	he	6463	’ returned Fanny , ‘
248145	248146	248136	248136	he	6463	’ ‘
248151	248159	248149	248149	he	6463	’ asked Little Dorrit in perfect simplicity . ‘
248176	248181	248184	248184	he	6463	’ said her sister . ‘
248239	248240	248241	248241	I	0	’ ‘
248248	248257	248243	248243	he	6463	’ said Little Dorrit after thinking a moment . ‘
248303	248304	248300	248300	I	0	’ ‘
248310	248311	248306	248306	you	0	’ ‘
248317	248321	248306	248306	you	0	’ said Fanny , ‘
248344	248384	248341	248341	you	0	’ Mr Sparkler had , undeniably , a weak appearance ; with his eye in the window like a knot in the glass , and no reason on earth for stopping his bark suddenly , except the real reason . ‘
248398	248418	248386	248386	you	0	’ said Fanny , almost as well composed in the graceful indifference of her attitude as Mrs Merdle herself , ‘
248424	248425	248421	248421	you	0	’ ‘
248429	248445	248426	248426	I	0	’ said Little Dorrit--‘I think I rather mean what do you mean , dear Fanny ? ’
248477	248514	248466	248466	her	342	‘ Now tell me , my little pet . When we saw that woman at Martigny , how did you think she carried it off ? Did you see what she decided on in a moment ? ’
248515	248520	248466	248466	her	342	‘ No , Fanny . ’
248521	248621	248466	248466	her	342	‘ Then I ’ll tell you , Amy . She settled with herself , now I ’ll never refer to that meeting under such different circumstances , and I ’ll never pretend to have any idea that these are the same girls . That ’s _ her _ way out of a difficulty . What did I tell you when we came away from Harley Street that time ? She is as insolent and false as any woman in the world . But in the first capacity , my love , she may find people who can match her . ’
248648	248653	248655	248655	Fanny	342	‘ Not only that , ’
248657	248719	248655	248655	Fanny	342	‘ but she gives the same charge to Young Sparkler ; and does n’t let him come after me until she has got it thoroughly into his most ridiculous of all ridiculous noddles ( for one really ca n’t call it a head ) , that he is to pretend to have been first struck with me in that Inn Yard . ’
248720	248723	248725	248726	Little Dorrit	585	‘ Why ? ’
248728	248737	248725	248726	Little Dorrit	585	‘ Why ? Good gracious , my love ! ’
248751	248813	248815	248816	Miss Fanny	342	‘ how can you ask ? Do n’t you see that I may have become a rather desirable match for a noddle ? And do n’t you see that she puts the deception upon us , and makes a pretence , while she shifts it from her own shoulders ( very good shoulders they are too , I must say ) , ’
248823	248829	248815	248816	Miss Fanny	342	‘ of considering our feelings ? ’
248830	248842	248815	248816	Miss Fanny	342	‘ But we can always go back to the plain truth . ’
248843	248854	248856	248856	Fanny	342	‘ Yes , but if you please we wo n’t , ’
248858	248891	248856	248856	Fanny	342	‘ No ; I am not going to have that done , Amy . The pretext is none of mine ; it ’s hers , and she shall have enough of it . ’
248928	248931	248933	248933	Fanny	342	‘ No , ’
248935	249003	248933	248933	Fanny	342	‘ She shall find me go her way . She took it , and I ’ll follow it . And , with the blessing of fate and fortune , I ’ll go on improving that woman ’s acquaintance until I have given her maid , before her eyes , things from my dressmaker ’s ten times as handsome and expensive as she once gave me from hers ! ’
249073	249084	249069	249069	Her	6477	‘ Do you mean to encourage Mr Sparkler , Fanny ? ’
249085	249092	249094	249095	her sister	1027	‘ Encourage him , my dear ? ’
249100	249128	249094	249095	her sister	1027	‘ that depends upon what you call encourage . No , I do n’t mean to encourage him . But I ’ll make a slave of him . ’
249192	249234	249151	249151	She	342	‘ I shall make him fetch and carry , my dear , and I shall make him subject to me . And if I do n’t make his mother subject to me , too , it shall not be my fault . ’
249235	249266	249151	249151	She	342	‘ Do you think -- dear Fanny , do n’t be offended , we are so comfortable together now -- that you can quite see the end of that course ? ’
249267	249285	249287	249287	Fanny	342	‘ I ca n’t say I have so much as looked for it yet , my dear , ’
249293	249342	249287	249287	Fanny	342	‘ all in good time . Such are my intentions . And really they have taken me so long to develop , that here we are at home . And Young Sparkler at the door , inquiring who is within . By the merest accident , of course ! ’
249529	249535	249525	249525	himself	472	‘ Not at all so . ’
249613	249617	249619	249620	Mr Sparkler	472	‘ Thank you , ’
249622	249633	249619	249620	Mr Sparkler	472	‘ she ’s uncommonly well -- at least , poorly . ’
249634	249638	249640	249641	Miss Fanny	342	‘ In Venice ? ’
249643	249647	249648	249649	Mr Sparkler	472	‘ In Rome , ’
249652	249685	249648	249649	Mr Sparkler	472	‘ I am here by myself , myself . I came to call upon Mr Edward Dorrit myself . Indeed , upon Mr Dorrit likewise . In fact , upon the family . ’
250328	250338	250340	250341	his host	3274	‘ I hear you are acquainted , Mr Sparkler , ’
250345	250357	250340	250341	his host	3274	‘ with -- ha -- Mr Gowan . Mr Henry Gowan ? ’
250358	250363	250365	250366	Mr Sparkler	472	‘ Perfectly , sir , ’
250368	250379	250365	250366	Mr Sparkler	472	‘ His mother and my mother are cronies in fact . ’
250380	250390	250392	250393	Mr Dorrit	578	‘ If I had thought of it , Amy , ’
250407	250472	250392	250393	Mr Dorrit	578	‘ you should have despatched a note to them , asking them to dine to - day . Some of our people could have -- ha -- fetched them , and taken them home . We could have spared a -- hum -- gondola for that purpose . I am sorry to have forgotten this . Pray remind me of them to - morrow . ’
250498	250511	250513	250514	Mr Dorrit	578	‘ Pray , does Mr Henry Gowan paint -- ha -- Portraits ? ’
250531	250538	250540	250541	Mr Dorrit	578	‘ He has no particular walk ? ’
250600	250604	250606	250607	Mr Dorrit	578	‘ No speciality ? ’
250632	250643	250629	250629	he	472	‘ No , thank you . I seldom take it . ’
250644	250647	250649	250650	Mr Dorrit	578	‘ Well ! ’
250652	250728	250649	250650	Mr Dorrit	578	‘ It would be very agreeable to me to present a gentleman so connected , with some -- ha -- Testimonial of my desire to further his interests , and develop the -- hum -- germs of his genius . I think I must engage Mr Gowan to paint my picture . If the result should be -- ha -- mutually satisfactory , I might afterwards engage him to try his hand upon my family . ’

251300	251316	251297	251297	he	537	‘ since he was made happy to - day by a visit from fair ladies . ’
251317	251321	251323	251323	Fanny	342	‘ A loss ? ’
251336	251340	251342	251342	Blandois	537	‘ A loss , ’
251344	251349	251342	251342	Blandois	537	‘ His dog Lion . ’
251362	251367	251369	251369	Blandois	537	‘ He is dead , ’
251371	251374	251369	251369	Blandois	537	‘ Dead ? ’
251379	251384	251376	251377	Little Dorrit	585	‘ That noble dog ? ’

251401	251417	251393	251393	Blandois	537	‘ somebody has poisoned that noble dog . He is as dead as the Doges ! ’
251852	251855	251857	251857	Fanny	342	‘ Amy , ’
251896	251919	251857	251857	Fanny	342	‘ I am going to put something into your little head . You wo n’t guess what it is , I suspect . ’
251920	251931	251933	251934	Little Dorrit	585	‘ I do n’t think that ’s likely , dear , ’
251936	251948	251950	251950	Fanny	342	‘ Come , I ’ll give you a clue , child , ’
251952	251956	251950	251950	Fanny	342	‘ Mrs General . ’
252007	252018	252020	252020	Fanny	342	‘ _ Now _ , can you guess , Amy ? ’
252022	252033	252035	252036	Little Dorrit	585	‘ No , dear . Unless I have done anything , ’
252114	252123	252125	252125	Fanny	342	‘ Oh , our Amy , our Amy ! ’
252127	252157	252125	252125	Fanny	342	‘ What a timid little goose our Amy is ! But this is nothing to laugh at . On the contrary , I am very cross , my dear . ’
252158	252173	252175	252176	her sister	1027	‘ As it is not with me , Fanny , I do n’t mind , ’
252180	252188	252190	252190	Fanny	342	‘ Ah ! But I do mind , ’
252192	252221	252190	252190	Fanny	342	‘ and so will you , Pet , when I enlighten you . Amy , has it never struck you that somebody is monstrously polite to Mrs General ? ’
252222	252230	252232	252233	Little Dorrit	585	‘ Everybody is polite to Mrs General , ’
252235	252237	252232	252233	Little Dorrit	585	‘ Because-- ’
252238	252246	252248	252248	Fanny	342	‘ Because she freezes them into it ? ’
252250	252281	252282	252282	Amy	349	‘ I do n’t mean that ; quite different from that . Come ! Has it never struck you , Amy , that Pa is monstrously polite to Mrs General . ’
252285	252288	252232	252233	Little Dorrit	585	‘ No , ’
252293	252305	252307	252307	Fanny	342	‘ No ; I dare say not . But he is , ’
252309	252327	252307	252307	Fanny	342	‘ He is , Amy . And remember my words . Mrs General has designs on Pa ! ’
252328	252346	252232	252233	Little Dorrit	585	‘ Dear Fanny , do you think it possible that Mrs General has designs on any one ? ’
252347	252354	252356	252356	Fanny	342	‘ Do I think it possible ? ’
252358	252444	252356	252356	Fanny	342	‘ My love , I know it . I tell you she has designs on Pa. And more than that , I tell you Pa considers her such a wonder , such a paragon of accomplishment , and such an acquisition to our family , that he is ready to get himself into a state of perfect infatuation with her at any moment . And that opens a pretty picture of things , I hope ? Think of me with Mrs General for a Mama ! ’
252451	252462	252464	252464	she	6570	‘ Think of me with Mrs General for a Mama ; ’

252491	252548	252487	252487	Fanny	342	‘ You might as well ask me how I know when a man is struck with myself ! But , of course I do know . It happens pretty often : but I always know it . I know this in much the same way , I suppose . At all events , I know it . ’
252549	252557	252464	252464	she	6570	‘ You never heard Papa say anything ? ’
252558	252562	252564	252564	Fanny	342	‘ Say anything ? ’
252566	252586	252564	252564	Fanny	342	‘ My dearest , darling child , what necessity has he had , yet awhile , to say anything ? ’
252587	252598	252464	252464	she	6570	‘ And you have never heard Mrs General say anything ? ’
252599	252606	252608	252608	Fanny	342	‘ My goodness me , Amy , ’
252610	252686	252608	252608	Fanny	342	‘ is she the sort of woman to say anything ? Is n’t it perfectly plain and clear that she has nothing to do at present but to hold herself upright , keep her aggravating gloves on , and go sweeping about ? Say anything ! If she had the ace of trumps in her hand at whist , she would n’t say anything , child . It would come out when she played it . ’
252687	252704	252464	252464	she	6570	‘ At least , you may be mistaken , Fanny . Now , may you not ? ’
252705	252715	252717	252717	Fanny	342	‘ O yes , I _ may _ be , ’
252719	252798	252717	252717	Fanny	342	‘ but I am not . However , I am glad you can contemplate such an escape , my dear , and I am glad that you can take this for the present with sufficient coolness to think of such a chance . It makes me hope that you may be able to bear the connection . I should not be able to bear it , and I should not try . I ’d marry young Sparkler first . ’
252799	252814	252464	252464	she	6570	‘ O , you would never marry him , Fanny , under any circumstances . ’
252815	252823	252825	252827	that young lady	5026	‘ Upon my word , my dear , ’
252832	252888	252825	252827	that young lady	5026	‘ I would n’t positively answer even for that . There ’s no knowing what might happen . Especially as I should have many opportunities , afterwards , of treating that woman , his mother , in her own style . Which I most decidedly should not be slow to avail myself of , Amy . ’
253510	253523	253525	253525	he	537	‘ It may be a defect in my mental vision , Blandois , ’
253527	253543	253525	253525	he	537	‘ but may I die if I see what you have to do with this . ’
253544	253550	253552	253552	Blandois	537	‘ Death of my life , ’
253554	253569	253552	253552	Blandois	537	‘ nor I neither , except that I thought I was serving my friend . ’
253570	253581	253583	253583	Gowan	576	‘ By putting an upstart ’s hire in his pocket ? ’
253587	253631	253583	253583	Gowan	576	‘ Do you mean that ? Tell your other friend to get his head painted for the sign of some public - house , and to get it done by a sign - painter . Who am I , and who is he ? ’
253632	253635	253552	253552	Blandois	537	‘ Professore , ’
253640	253646	253552	253552	Blandois	537	‘ and who is Blandois ? ’
253687	253723	253669	253669	he	576	‘ Well , Blandois , when shall we go to this Maecenas of yours ? We journeymen must take jobs when we can get them . When shall we go and look after this job ? ’
253724	253729	253731	253733	the injured Blandois	537	‘ When you will , ’
253735	253754	253731	253733	the injured Blandois	537	‘ as you please . What have I to do with it ? What is it to me ? ’
253755	253766	253768	253768	Gowan	576	‘ I can tell you what it is to me , ’
253770	253786	253768	253768	Gowan	576	‘ Bread and cheese . One must eat ! So come along , my Blandois . ’
253815	253822	253824	253824	Gowan	576	‘ How are you , Sparkler ? ’
253827	253852	253824	253824	Gowan	576	‘ When you have to live by your mother wit , old boy , I hope you may get on better than I do . ’
253860	253863	253865	253865	Gowan	576	‘ Sir , ’
253875	253940	253942	253942	he	578	‘ I am new to the trade , and not expert at its mysteries . I believe I ought to look at you in various lights , tell you you are a capital subject , and consider when I shall be sufficiently disengaged to devote myself with the necessary enthusiasm to the fine picture I mean to make of you . I assure you , ’
253946	254114	253942	253942	he	578	‘ I feel quite a traitor in the camp of those dear , gifted , good , noble fellows , my brother artists , by not doing the hocus - pocus better . But I have not been brought up to it , and it ’s too late to learn it . Now , the fact is , I am a very bad painter , but not much worse than the generality . If you are going to throw away a hundred guineas or so , I am as poor as a poor relation of great people usually is , and I shall be very much obliged to you , if you ’ll throw them away upon me . I ’ll do the best I can for the money ; and if the best should be bad , why even then , you may probably have a bad picture with a small name to it , instead of a bad picture with a large name to it . ’
254191	254197	254199	254199	Gowan	576	‘ You are very good , ’
254201	254264	254199	254199	Gowan	576	‘ I have not forsworn society since I joined the brotherhood of the brush ( the most delightful fellows on the face of the earth ) , and am glad enough to smell the old fine gunpowder now and then , though it did blow me into mid - air and my present calling . You ’ll not think , Mr Dorrit , ’
254275	254333	254267	254267	he	578	‘ that I am lapsing into the freemasonry of the craft -- for it ’s not so ; upon my life I ca n’t help betraying it wherever I go , though , by Jupiter , I love and honour the craft with all my might -- if I propose a stipulation as to time and place ? ’
254354	254361	254363	254363	Gowan	576	‘ Again you are very good , ’
254365	254476	254363	254363	Gowan	576	‘ Mr Dorrit , I hear you are going to Rome . I am going to Rome , having friends there . Let me begin to do you the injustice I have conspired to do you , there -- not here . We shall all be hurried during the rest of our stay here ; and though there ’s not a poorer man with whole elbows in Venice , than myself , I have not quite got all the Amateur out of me yet -- comprising the trade again , you see!--and ca n’t fall on to order , in a hurry , for the mere sake of the sixpences . ’
255010	255026	255006	255006	he	537	‘ I have a secret power in this quarter . I know what I know . ’
255118	255136	255099	255100	The two	12339	‘ You were going to talk about me . Ha ! Behold me here to prevent it ! ’
255137	255143	255145	255145	Blandois	537	‘ Gowan is coming here ? ’
255159	255163	255165	255165	Blandois	537	‘ Not coming ! ’
255167	255183	255165	255165	Blandois	537	‘ Permit your devoted servant , when you leave here , to escort you home . ’
255184	255194	255151	255152	Mrs Gowan	576	‘ Thank you : I am not going home . ’
255195	255200	255202	255202	Blandois	537	‘ Not going home ! ’
255204	255210	255202	255202	Blandois	537	‘ Then I am forlorn . ’
255255	255273	255274	255274	He	537	‘ No , no , no , dear ladies . Behold me here expressly to prevent it ! ’
255336	255363	255319	255319	she	6625	‘ No , thank you . But , if you will please to see if my boatman is there , I shall be obliged to you . ’
255389	255395	255385	255386	Mrs Gowan	576	‘ He killed the dog . ’
255396	255403	255404	255405	Little Dorrit	585	‘ Does Mr Gowan know it ? ’
255408	255448	255404	255405	Little Dorrit	585	‘ No one knows it . Do n’t look towards me ; look towards him . He will turn his face in a moment . No one knows it , but I am sure he did . You are ? ’
255449	255456	255457	255458	Little Dorrit	585	‘ I -- I think so , ’
255461	255550	255457	255458	Little Dorrit	585	‘ Henry likes him , and he will not think ill of him ; he is so generous and open himself . But you and I feel sure that we think of him as he deserves . He argued with Henry that the dog had been already poisoned when he changed so , and sprang at him . Henry believes it , but we do not . I see he is listening , but ca n’t hear . Good - bye , my love ! Good - bye ! ’
256490	256494	256496	256497	Mrs Merdle	464	‘ So delighted , ’
256499	256510	256496	256497	Mrs Merdle	464	‘ to resume an acquaintance so inauspiciously begun at Martigny . ’
256511	256518	256520	256520	Fanny	342	‘ At Martigny , of course , ’
256522	256529	256520	256520	Fanny	342	‘ Charmed , I am sure ! ’
256530	256534	256536	256537	Mrs Merdle	464	‘ I understand , ’
256539	256563	256536	256537	Mrs Merdle	464	‘ from my son Edmund Sparkler , that he has already improved that chance occasion . He has returned quite transported with Venice . ’
256564	256567	256569	256571	the careless Fanny	342	‘ Indeed ? ’
256573	256579	256569	256571	the careless Fanny	342	‘ Was he there long ? ’
256580	256590	256592	256593	Mrs Merdle	464	‘ I might refer that question to Mr Dorrit , ’
256602	256617	256592	256593	Mrs Merdle	464	‘ Edmund having been so much indebted to him for rendering his stay agreeable . ’
256618	256628	256630	256630	Fanny	342	‘ Oh , pray do n’t speak of it , ’
256632	256677	256630	256630	Fanny	342	‘ I believe Papa had the pleasure of inviting Mr Sparkler twice or thrice,--but it was nothing . We had so many people about us , and kept such open house , that if he had that pleasure , it was less than nothing . ’
256678	256684	256686	256687	Mr Dorrit	578	‘ Except , my dear , ’
256689	256750	256686	256687	Mr Dorrit	578	‘ except -- ha -- as it afforded me unusual gratification to -- hum -- show by any means , however slight and worthless , the -- ha , hum -- high estimation in which , in -- ha -- common with the rest of the world , I hold so distinguished and princely a character as Mr Merdle ’s . ’
256762	256766	256768	256768	Fanny	342	‘ Mr Merdle , ’
256781	256797	256775	256776	Mr Sparkler	472	‘ is quite a theme of Papa ’s , you must know , Mrs Merdle . ’
256798	256809	256811	256812	Mr Dorrit	578	‘ I have been -- ha -- disappointed , madam , ’
256814	256836	256811	256812	Mr Dorrit	578	‘ to understand from Mr Sparkler that there is no great -- hum -- probability of Mr Merdle ’s coming abroad . ’
256837	256842	256844	256845	Mrs Merdle	464	‘ Why , indeed , ’
256847	256891	256844	256845	Mrs Merdle	464	‘ he is so much engaged and in such request , that I fear not . He has not been able to get abroad for years . You , Miss Dorrit , I believe have been almost continually abroad for a long time . ’
256892	256897	256899	256899	Fanny	342	‘ Oh dear yes , ’
256906	256913	256899	256899	Fanny	342	‘ An immense number of years . ’
256914	256921	256923	256924	Mrs Merdle	464	‘ So I should have inferred , ’
256926	256929	256931	256931	Fanny	342	‘ Exactly , ’
256933	256939	256931	256931	Fanny	342	‘ I trust , however , ’
256944	256993	256941	256942	Mr Dorrit	578	‘ that if I have not the -- hum -- great advantage of becoming known to Mr Merdle on this side of the Alps or Mediterranean , I shall have that honour on returning to England . It is an honour I particularly desire and shall particularly esteem . ’
256994	256998	257000	257001	Mrs Merdle	464	‘ Mr Merdle , ’
257016	257028	257000	257001	Mrs Merdle	464	‘ will esteem it , I am sure , no less . ’
257144	257148	257137	257140	The Dowager Mrs Gowan	576	‘ It Never Does ’
257727	257733	257734	257734	he	374	‘ having a lenient consideration , ’
257737	257746	257734	257734	he	374	‘ for my being no workman , Doyce . ’
257747	257751	257753	257753	Doyce	374	‘ No workman ? ’
257755	257787	257753	257753	Doyce	374	‘ You would have been a thorough workman if you had given yourself to it . You have as good a head for understanding such things as I have met with . ’
257788	257800	257802	257802	Clennam	585	‘ A totally uneducated one , I am sorry to add , ’
257804	257811	257802	257802	Clennam	585	‘ I do n’t know that , ’
257815	257887	257813	257813	Doyce	374	‘ and I would n’t have you say that . No man of sense who has been generally improved , and has improved himself , can be called quite uneducated as to anything . I do n’t particularly favour mysteries . I would as soon , on a fair and clear explanation , be judged by one class of man as another , provided he had the qualification I have named . ’
257888	257893	257895	257895	Clennam--‘this	604	‘ At all events , ’
257926	257927	257911	257911	I	0	’ ‘
257930	257940	257911	257911	I	0	’ said Daniel , in his steady even way , ‘
257949	258274	258275	258275	Doyce	374	’ He had the power , often to be found in union with such a character , of explaining what he himself perceived , and meant , with the direct force and distinctness with which it struck his own mind . His manner of demonstration was so orderly and neat and simple , that it was not easy to mistake him . There was something almost ludicrous in the complete irreconcilability of a vague conventional notion that he must be a visionary man , with the precise , sagacious travelling of his eye and thumb over the plans , their patient stoppages at particular points , their careful returns to other points whence little channels of explanation had to be traced up , and his steady manner of making everything good and everything sound at each important stage , before taking his hearer on a line’s - breadth further . His dismissal of himself from his description , was hardly less remarkable . He never said , I discovered this adaptation or invented that combination ; but showed the whole thing as if the Divine artificer had made it , and he had happened to find it ; so modest he was about it , such a pleasant touch of respect was mingled with his quiet admiration of it , and so calmly convinced he was that it was established on irrefragable laws . Not only that evening , but for several succeeding evenings , Clennam was quite charmed by this investigation . The more he pursued it , and the oftener he glanced at the grey head bending over it , and the shrewd eye kindling with pleasure in it and love of it -- instrument for probing his heart though it had been made for twelve long years -- the less he could reconcile it to his younger energy to let it go without one effort more . At length he said : ‘
258305	258306	258275	258275	Doyce	374	’ ‘
258309	258313	258275	258275	Doyce	374	’ returned Doyce , ‘
258329	258330	258320	258320	gentlemen	9694	’ ‘
258336	258342	258320	258320	gentlemen	9694	’ said Clennam , bitterly . ‘
258347	258351	258320	258320	gentlemen	9694	’ observed Doyce . ‘
258371	258372	258320	258320	gentlemen	9694	’ ‘
258383	258387	258320	258320	gentlemen	9694	’ mused Clennam . ‘
258399	258403	258320	258320	gentlemen	9694	’ said Doyce . ‘
258409	258423	258320	258320	gentlemen	9694	’ cried Clennam , starting up and taking his work - roughened hand , ‘
258432	258446	258320	258320	gentlemen	9694	’ Doyce looked alarmed , and replied in a hurry -- for him , ‘
258499	258500	258503	258503	Doyce	374	’ ‘
258505	258509	258503	258503	Doyce	374	’ returned Clennam , ‘
258625	258973	258586	258586	I	0	’ Daniel Doyce was still reluctant to consent , and again and again urged that they had better put it by . But it was natural that he should gradually allow himself to be over - persuaded by Clennam , and should yield . Yield he did . So Arthur resumed the long and hopeless labour of striving to make way with the Circumlocution Office . The waiting - rooms of that Department soon began to be familiar with his presence , and he was generally ushered into them by its janitors much as a pickpocket might be shown into a police - office ; the principal difference being that the object of the latter class of public business is to keep the pickpocket , while the Circumlocution object was to get rid of Clennam . However , he was resolved to stick to the Great Department ; and so the work of form - filling , corresponding , minuting , memorandum - making , signing , counter - signing , counter - counter - signing , referring backwards and forwards , and referring sideways , crosswise , and zig - zag , recommenced . Here arises a feature of the Circumlocution Office , not previously mentioned in the present record . When that admirable Department got into trouble , and was , by some infuriated members of Parliament whom the smaller Barnacles almost suspected of labouring under diabolic possession , attacked on the merits of no individual case , but as an Institution wholly abominable and Bedlamite ; then the noble or right honourable Barnacle who represented it in the House , would smite that member and cleave him asunder , with a statement of the quantity of business ( for the prevention of business ) done by the Circumlocution Office . Then would that noble or right honourable Barnacle hold in his hand a paper containing a few figures , to which , with the permission of the House , he would entreat its attention . Then would the inferior Barnacles exclaim , obeying orders , ‘
258980	258982	258586	258586	I	0	’ and ‘
258985	260049	258586	258586	I	0	’ Then would the noble or right honourable Barnacle perceive , sir , from this little document , which he thought might carry conviction even to the perversest mind ( Derisive laughter and cheering from the Barnacle fry ) , that within the short compass of the last financial half - year , this much - maligned Department ( Cheers ) had written and received fifteen thousand letters ( Loud cheers ) , had written twenty - four thousand minutes ( Louder cheers ) , and thirty - two thousand five hundred and seventeen memoranda ( Vehement cheering ) . Nay , an ingenious gentleman connected with the Department , and himself a valuable public servant , had done him the favour to make a curious calculation of the amount of stationery consumed in it during the same period . It formed a part of this same short document ; and he derived from it the remarkable fact that the sheets of foolscap paper it had devoted to the public service would pave the footways on both sides of Oxford Street from end to end , and leave nearly a quarter of a mile to spare for the park ( Immense cheering and laughter ) ; while of tape -- red tape -- it had used enough to stretch , in graceful festoons , from Hyde Park Corner to the General Post Office . Then , amidst a burst of official exultation , would the noble or right honourable Barnacle sit down , leaving the mutilated fragments of the Member on the field . No one , after that exemplary demolition of him , would have the hardihood to hint that the more the Circumlocution Office did , the less was done , and that the greatest blessing it could confer on an unhappy public would be to do nothing . With sufficient occupation on his hands , now that he had this additional task -- such a task had many and many a serviceable man died of before his day -- Arthur Clennam led a life of slight variety . Regular visits to his mother ’s dull sick room , and visits scarcely less regular to Mr Meagles at Twickenham , were its only changes during many months . He sadly and sorely missed Little Dorrit . He had been prepared to miss her very much , but not so much . He knew to the full extent only through experience , what a large place in his life was left blank when her familiar little figure went out of it . He felt , too , that he must relinquish the hope of its return , understanding the family character sufficiently well to be assured that he and she were divided by a broad ground of separation . The old interest he had had in her , and her old trusting reliance on him , were tinged with melancholy in his mind : so soon had change stolen over them , and so soon had they glided into the past with other secret tendernesses . When he received her letter he was greatly moved , but did not the less sensibly feel that she was far divided from him by more than distance . It helped him to a clearer and keener perception of the place assigned him by the family . He saw that he was cherished in her grateful remembrance secretly , and that they resented him with the jail and the rest of its belongings . Through all these meditations which every day of his life crowded about her , he thought of her otherwise in the old way . She was his innocent friend , his delicate child , his dear Little Dorrit . This very change of circumstances fitted curiously in with the habit , begun on the night when the roses floated away , of considering himself as a much older man than his years really made him . He regarded her from a point of view which in its remoteness , tender as it was , he little thought would have been unspeakable agony to her . He speculated about her future destiny , and about the husband she might have , with an affection for her which would have drained her heart of its dearest drop of hope , and broken it . Everything about him tended to confirm him in the custom of looking on himself as an elderly man , from whom such aspirations as he had combated in the case of Minnie Gowan ( though that was not so long ago either , reckoning by months and seasons ) , were finally departed . His relations with her father and mother were like those on which a widower son - in - law might have stood . If the twin sister who was dead had lived to pass away in the bloom of womanhood , and he had been her husband , the nature of his intercourse with Mr and Mrs Meagles would probably have been just what it was . This imperceptibly helped to render habitual the impression within him , that he had done with , and dismissed that part of life . He invariably heard of Minnie from them , as telling them in her letters how happy she was , and how she loved her husband ; but inseparable from that subject , he invariably saw the old cloud on Mr Meagles ’s face . Mr Meagles had never been quite so radiant since the marriage as before . He had never quite recovered the separation from Pet . He was the same good - humoured , open creature ; but as if his face , from being much turned towards the pictures of his two children which could show him only one look , unconsciously adopted a characteristic from them , it always had now , through all its changes of expression , a look of loss in it . One wintry Saturday when Clennam was at the cottage , the Dowager Mrs Gowan drove up , in the Hampton Court equipage which pretended to be the exclusive equipage of so many individual proprietors . She descended , in her shady ambuscade of green fan , to favour Mr and Mrs Meagles with a call . ‘
260062	260071	260059	260060	Mama Meagles	408	’ said she , encouraging her humble connections . ‘
260085	260122	260075	260075	you	6732	’ My poor fellow was her son ; and this mode of speaking of him politely kept alive , without any offence in the world , the pretence that he had fallen a victim to the Meagles ’
260125	260132	260134	260135	Mrs Gowan	576	‘ And the dear pretty one ? ’
260137	260148	260134	260135	Mrs Gowan	576	‘ Have you later news of her than I have ? ’
260175	260180	260182	260183	Mrs Gowan	576	‘ I am sure , ’
260195	260250	260182	260183	Mrs Gowan	576	‘ it ’s an unspeakable comfort to know they continue happy . My poor fellow is of such a restless disposition , and has been so used to roving about , and to being inconstant and popular among all manner of people , that it ’s the greatest comfort in life . I suppose they ’re
260259	260270	260256	260257	Papa Meagles	407	’ Mr Meagles , fidgety under the question , replied , ‘
260286	260287	260277	260277	I	0	’ ‘
260294	260320	260292	260292	Meagles	289	’ returned the lady , tapping him on the arm with the green fan and then adroitly interposing it between a yawn and the company , ‘
260363	260384	260387	260387	you	289	’ ( Which went to the former purpose , by making Mr Meagles out to be an artful schemer . ) ‘
260427	260428	260431	260431	ma’am	10131	’ ‘
260433	260440	260431	260431	ma’am	10131	’ said Mr Meagles , gravely , ‘
260457	260458	260450	260450	Henry	576	’ ‘
260482	260502	260479	260480	Mama Meagles	408	’ exclaimed Mrs Gowan cheerfully , as if the absurd coincidence then flashed upon her for the first time , ‘
260528	260577	260479	260480	Mama Meagles	408	’ This again went to the former point , and showed Mr Meagles with all good breeding that , so far , he had been brilliantly successful in his deep designs . Mrs Gowan thought the hit so good a one , that she dwelt upon it ; repeating ‘
260601	260602	260598	260599	Papa Meagles	407	’ ‘
260610	260621	260605	260605	I	0	’ retorted Mr Meagles , a little heightened in colour , ‘
260627	260628	260633	260633	nobody	770	’ ‘
260635	260640	260641	260641	I	0	’ said Mrs Gowan . ‘
260664	260698	260659	260659	I	0	’ Drooping her large green fan , she looked musingly at Mr Meagles while she thought about it ; a performance not tending to the cooling of that gentleman ’s rather heated spirits . ‘
260707	260712	260659	260659	I	0	’ said Mrs Gowan . ‘
260740	260741	260727	260727	They	6755	’ ‘
260754	260793	260743	260743	us	6756	’ observed Mr Meagles . The Dowager for a moment gave him an angry look ; but tossed it off with her head and her fan , and pursued the tenor of her way in her former manner . ‘
260860	260878	260839	260839	you	0	’ Mr Meagles looked at his wife and at Clennam ; bit his lip ; and coughed . ‘
260887	260892	260839	260839	you	0	’ Mrs Gowan pursued , ‘

260969	260979	260967	260967	ma’am	10131	’ said Mr Meagles , as seeking an explanation . ‘
260984	261003	260967	260967	ma’am	10131	’ said Mrs Gowan , putting him in his inferior place with an expressive action of her hand . ‘
261148	261294	261295	261296	Mrs Gowan	576	’ Truly , having by this time said everything she could say in maintenance of her wonderfully mythical position , and in admonition to Mr Meagles that he must not expect to bear his honours of alliance too cheaply , Mrs Gowan was disposed to forgo the rest . If Mr Meagles had submitted to a glance of entreaty from Mrs Meagles , and an expressive gesture from Clennam , he would have left her in the undisturbed enjoyment of this state of mind . But Pet was the darling and pride of his heart ; and if he could ever have championed her more devotedly , or loved her better , than in the days when she was the sunlight of his house , it would have been now , when , as its daily grace and delight , she was lost to it . ‘
261300	261305	261295	261296	Mrs Gowan	576	’ said Mr Meagles , ‘
261347	261348	261349	261350	Papa Meagles	407	’ ‘
261352	261384	261349	261350	Papa Meagles	407	’ returned the Dowager , with an affable smile , but with the bloom on her cheeks standing out a little more vividly than usual as the neighbouring surface became paler , ‘
261388	261389	261349	261350	Papa Meagles	407	’ ‘
261396	261408	261392	261394	my good madam	4791	’ said Mr Meagles , at great pains to restrain himself , ‘

261433	261438	261430	261431	Mama Meagles	408	’ observed Mrs Gowan , ‘
261445	261478	261479	261479	Mother	294	’ Her turning to that worthy lady was an artifice to bring her into the discussion , quarrel with her , and vanquish her . Mr Meagles interposed to prevent that consummation . ‘
261481	261485	261479	261479	Mother	294	’ said he , ‘

261641	261652	261639	261639	father	1100	’ said Mrs Meagles the kind - hearted and comfortable . ‘

262022	262043	262019	262020	Papa Meagles	407	’ said Mrs Gowan , who became extremely deliberate and prepossessing in manner whenever that gentleman became at all warm , ‘
262156	262157	262158	262158	Mother	953	’ ‘
262160	262165	262158	262158	Mother	953	’ cried Mr Meagles . ‘

262188	262200	262174	262174	you	953	’ said Mrs Gowan , looking about as she fanned herself , ‘
262223	262261	262262	262262	Ma’am	608	’ Some moments passed in silence , before Mr Meagles could hold himself in his chair with sufficient security to prevent his breaking out of it at the next word he spoke . At last he said : ‘
262293	262294	262273	262273	I	0	’ ‘
262301	262315	262273	262273	I	0	’ said Mrs Gowan , smiling and shaking her head with accusatory intelligence , ‘

262334	262339	262332	262332	ma’am	10131	’ said Mr Meagles , ‘
262364	262387	262388	262388	I	0	’ That Mr Meagles could really say no more about it , in short , but passed his handkerchief before his face . ‘
262394	262405	262388	262388	I	0	’ said Mrs Gowan , composedly looking over her fan . ‘

262438	262448	262418	262419	Mr Clennam	304	’ said Clennam , looked to by all parties , ‘

262549	262590	262546	262546	You	0	’ said Mrs Gowan , turning the palms of her hands towards Mr Meagles , as if she were Justice herself , representing to him that he had better confess , for he had not a leg to stand on . ‘
262604	262609	262546	262546	You	0	’ here she rose ; ‘
262684	262694	262636	262636	I	0	’ Mr Meagles asked , What kind of thing ? ‘
262700	262705	262636	262636	I	0	’ said Mrs Gowan , ‘
262759	262765	262771	262771	ma’am--	12459	’ Mr Meagles was beginning , ‘

262890	263094	263095	263095	Arthur	304	’ The Dowager here made a smiling obeisance , rather to the room than to any one in it , and therewith took a final farewell of Papa and Mama Meagles . Clennam stepped forward to hand her to the Pill - Box which was at the service of all the Pills in Hampton Court Palace ; and she got into that vehicle with distinguished serenity , and was driven away . Thenceforth the Dowager , with a light and careless humour , often recounted to her particular acquaintance how , after a hard trial , she had found it impossible to know those people who belonged to Henry ’s wife , and who had made that desperate set to catch him . Whether she had come to the conclusion beforehand , that to get rid of them would give her favourite pretence a better air , might save her some occasional inconvenience , and could risk no loss ( the pretty creature being fast married , and her father devoted to her ) , was best known to herself . Though this history has its opinion on that point too , and decidedly in the affirmative . CHAPTER 9 . Appearance and Disappearance ‘
263101	263114	263095	263095	Arthur	304	’ said Mr Meagles , on the evening of the following day , ‘
263149	263150	263151	263151	I	0	’ ‘
263154	263158	263151	263151	I	0	’ said Arthur . ‘

263218	263222	263228	263228	You	304	’ said Arthur . ‘

263284	263288	263276	263276	you	304	’ returned Arthur , ‘
263298	263337	263295	263295	you	304	’ He had glanced at Mrs Meagles , who was always on the good and sensible side ; and a petition had shone out of her honest face that he would support Mr Meagles in his present inclinings . ‘
263350	263355	263346	263346	Mother	294	’ said Mr Meagles , ‘
263396	263397	263399	263399	I	0	’ ‘
263404	263433	263399	263399	I	0	’ replied Arthur , touched by the motherly anticipation in the bright face of Mrs Meagles ( she must have been very like her daughter , once ) , ‘
263459	263460	263452	263452	you	0	’ ‘
263467	263472	263452	263452	you	0	’ said Mr Meagles . ‘
263483	263506	263452	263452	you	0	’ Mother , with a look which thanked Clennam in a manner very agreeable to him , answered that it was indeed . ‘
263515	263528	263452	263452	you	0	’ said Mr Meagles , the old cloud coming over his face , ‘
263676	263689	263673	263673	you	304	’ said Mr Meagles , adding a new version to the proverb , ‘
263701	263702	263673	263673	you	304	’ ‘
263707	263711	263673	263673	you	304	’ observed Arthur , ‘
263719	263720	263721	263721	I	0	’ ‘
263793	263802	263783	263783	I	0	’ said Mr Meagles , shaking his head , ‘
263834	263835	263820	263820	I	0	’ ‘
263842	263846	263820	263820	I	0	’ returned Clennam , ‘
263877	263878	263870	263870	you	304	’ ‘
263891	263900	263881	263881	I	0	’ said Mr Meagles , turning it over , ‘
264052	264074	264050	264050	Mother	294	’ They would do best by themselves perhaps , after all , Clennam thought ; therefore did not press his proposal . ‘
264094	264099	264100	264100	I	0	’ Mr Meagles resumed , ‘
264198	264529	264530	264530	I	0	’ Mr Meagles broke off , cleared his throat , and got up to look out of the window . They agreed that the weather was of high promise ; and Clennam kept the talk in that safe direction until it had become easy again , when he gently diverted it to Henry Gowan and his quick sense and agreeable qualities when he was delicately dealt with ; he likewise dwelt on the indisputable affection he entertained for his wife . Clennam did not fail of his effect upon good Mr Meagles , whom these commendations greatly cheered ; and who took Mother to witness that the single and cordial desire of his heart in reference to their daughter ’s husband , was harmoniously to exchange friendship for friendship , and confidence for confidence . Within a few hours the cottage furniture began to be wrapped up for preservation in the family absence -- or , as Mr Meagles expressed it , the house began to put its hair in papers -- and within a few days Father and Mother were gone , Mrs Tickit and Dr Buchan were posted , as of yore , behind the parlour blind , and Arthur ’s solitary feet were rustling among the dry fallen leaves in the garden walks . As he had a liking for the spot , he seldom let a week pass without paying a visit . Sometimes , he went down alone from Saturday to Monday ; sometimes his partner accompanied him ; sometimes , he merely strolled for an hour or two about the house and garden , saw that all was right , and returned to London again . At all times , and under all circumstances , Mrs Tickit , with her dark row of curls , and Dr Buchan , sat in the parlour window , looking out for the family return . On one of his visits Mrs Tickit received him with the words , ‘
264545	264587	264537	264538	Mr Clennam	304	’ So surprising was the something in question , that it actually brought Mrs Tickit out of the parlour window and produced her in the garden walk , when Clennam went in at the gate on its being opened for him . ‘
264595	264599	264592	264593	Mrs Tickit	433	’ said he . ‘
264602	264619	264592	264593	Mrs Tickit	433	’ returned that faithful housekeeper , having taken him into the parlour and closed the door ; ‘
264645	264646	264636	264636	her	6831	’ ‘
264652	264653	264636	264636	her	6831	’ ‘
264659	264671	264656	264656	I	0	’ quoth Mrs Tickit , clearing the disclosure at a leap . ‘
264674	264675	264676	264677	Mr Clennam	304	’ ‘
264679	264684	264676	264677	Mr Clennam	304	’ returned Mrs Tickit , ‘
264745	264760	264734	264735	a person	4129	’ Without entering upon an inquiry into this curious abnormal condition , Clennam said , ‘
264765	264766	264734	264735	a person	4129	’ ‘
264771	264776	264769	264769	sir	933	’ proceeded Mrs Tickit , ‘
264799	264800	264796	264796	anybody	1507	’ ‘
264804	264808	264796	264796	anybody	1507	’ said Clennam . ‘
264811	264812	264796	264796	anybody	1507	’ ‘
264827	264832	264815	264815	I	0	’ pursued Mrs Tickit , ‘
264860	264872	264855	264856	a person	4129	’ Mrs Tickit said this with an argumentative and philosophic air , ‘
264908	264918	264901	264902	a person	4129	’ Arthur subscribed to this discovery with a nod . ‘
264934	264939	264927	264927	I	0	’ said Mrs Tickit , ‘
265059	265084	265052	265052	they	4129	’ He nodded again ; afraid to utter a word , lest it should present any new opening to Mrs Tickit ’s conversational powers . ‘
265090	265095	265052	265052	they	4129	’ said Mrs Tickit , ‘
265198	265199	265194	265194	I	0	’ ‘
265205	265209	265210	265210	I	0	’ said Clennam . ‘
265214	265219	265210	265210	I	0	’ assented Mrs Tickit , ‘
265261	265287	265257	265259	that young woman	6850	’ Passing over the absence from the firmament of this novel constellation , Arthur inquired of Mrs Tickit if she herself went beyond the gate ? ‘
265298	265303	265257	265259	that young woman	6850	’ said Mrs Tickit , ‘
265311	266416	265257	265259	that young woman	6850	’ He then asked Mrs Tickit how long a space of time she supposed there might have been between the two sets of ocular quiverings she had experienced ? Mrs Tickit , though minutely circumstantial in her reply , had no settled opinion between five seconds and ten minutes . She was so plainly at sea on this part of the case , and had so clearly been startled out of slumber , that Clennam was much disposed to regard the appearance as a dream . Without hurting Mrs Tickit ’s feelings with that infidel solution of her mystery , he took it away from the cottage with him ; and probably would have retained it ever afterwards if a circumstance had not soon happened to change his opinion . He was passing at nightfall along the Strand , and the lamp - lighter was going on before him , under whose hand the street - lamps , blurred by the foggy air , burst out one after another , like so many blazing sunflowers coming into full - blow all at once,--when a stoppage on the pavement , caused by a train of coal - waggons toiling up from the wharves at the river - side , brought him to a stand - still . He had been walking quickly , and going with some current of thought , and the sudden check given to both operations caused him to look freshly about him , as people under such circumstances usually do . Immediately , he saw in advance -- a few people intervening , but still so near to him that he could have touched them by stretching out his arm -- Tattycoram and a strange man of a remarkable appearance : a swaggering man , with a high nose , and a black moustache as false in its colour as his eyes were false in their expression , who wore his heavy cloak with the air of a foreigner . His dress and general appearance were those of a man on travel , and he seemed to have very recently joined the girl . In bending down ( being much taller than she was ) , listening to whatever she said to him , he looked over his shoulder with the suspicious glance of one who was not unused to be mistrustful that his footsteps might be dogged . It was then that Clennam saw his face ; as his eyes lowered on the people behind him in the aggregate , without particularly resting upon Clennam ’s face or any other . He had scarcely turned his head about again , and it was still bent down , listening to the girl , when the stoppage ceased , and the obstructed stream of people flowed on . Still bending his head and listening to the girl , he went on at her side , and Clennam followed them , resolved to play this unexpected play out , and see where they went . He had hardly made the determination ( though he was not long about it ) , when he was again as suddenly brought up as he had been by the stoppage . They turned short into the Adelphi,--the girl evidently leading,--and went straight on , as if they were going to the Terrace which overhangs the river . There is always , to this day , a sudden pause in that place to the roar of the great thoroughfare . The many sounds become so deadened that the change is like putting cotton in the ears , or having the head thickly muffled . At that time the contrast was far greater ; there being no small steam - boats on the river , no landing places but slippery wooden stairs and foot - causeways , no railroad on the opposite bank , no hanging bridge or fish - market near at hand , no traffic on the nearest bridge of stone , nothing moving on the stream but watermen ’s wherries and coal - lighters . Long and broad black tiers of the latter , moored fast in the mud as if they were never to move again , made the shore funereal and silent after dark ; and kept what little water - movement there was , far out towards mid - stream . At any hour later than sunset , and not least at that hour when most of the people who have anything to eat at home are going home to eat it , and when most of those who have nothing have hardly yet slunk out to beg or steal , it was a deserted place and looked on a deserted scene . Such was the hour when Clennam stopped at the corner , observing the girl and the strange man as they went down the street . The man ’s footsteps were so noisy on the echoing stones that he was unwilling to add the sound of his own . But when they had passed the turning and were in the darkness of the dark corner leading to the terrace , he made after them with such indifferent appearance of being a casual passenger on his way , as he could assume . When he rounded the dark corner , they were walking along the terrace towards a figure which was coming towards them . If he had seen it by itself , under such conditions of gas - lamp , mist , and distance , he might not have known it at first sight , but with the figure of the girl to prompt him , he at once recognised Miss Wade . He stopped at the corner , seeming to look back expectantly up the street as if he had made an appointment with some one to meet him there ; but he kept a careful eye on the three . When they came together , the man took off his hat , and made Miss Wade a bow . The girl appeared to say a few words as though she presented him , or accounted for his being late , or early , or what not ; and then fell a pace or so behind , by herself . Miss Wade and the man then began to walk up and down ; the man having the appearance of being extremely courteous and complimentary in manner ; Miss Wade having the appearance of being extremely haughty . When they came down to the corner and turned , she was saying , ‘
266442	266443	266432	266432	yourself	933	’ ‘
266449	266458	266445	266445	Heaven	309	’ he replied , making her another bow . ‘
266478	266479	266480	266480	I	0	’ ‘
266492	266496	266480	266480	I	0	’ said she , ‘
266512	266513	266509	266509	your	10131	’ ‘
266518	266530	266509	266509	your	10131	’ he asked , with an air of half abashed gallantry . ‘
266535	266539	266531	266531	You	933	’ she said , ‘
266547	266672	266673	266673	You	6854	’ Whether the girl hung behind because she was not to hear the business , or as already knowing enough about it , Clennam could not determine . They turned and she turned . She looked away at the river , as she walked with her hands folded before her ; and that was all he could make of her without showing his face . There happened , by good fortune , to be a lounger really waiting for some one ; and he sometimes looked over the railing at the water , and sometimes came to the dark corner and looked up the street , rendering Arthur less conspicuous . When Miss Wade and the man came back again , she was saying , ‘
266681	266682	266673	266673	You	6854	’ ‘
266687	266691	266673	266673	You	6854	’ he returned . ‘
266704	266705	266708	266708	I	0	’ ‘
266723	266751	266708	266708	I	0	’ She stopped in the roadway , as if to put an end to the conference . He of course stopped too . And the girl stopped . ‘
266758	266763	266708	266708	I	0	’ said the man . ‘
266822	266823	266824	266824	Harriet	297	’ ‘
266826	266831	266824	266824	Harriet	297	’ said Miss Wade , ‘
266849	267555	266824	266824	Harriet	297	’ She said it with a slur of the word gentleman which was more contemptuous than any emphasis , and walked slowly on . The man bent his head again , and the girl spoke to him as they both followed her . Clennam ventured to look at the girl as they moved away . He could note that her rich black eyes were fastened upon the man with a scrutinising expression , and that she kept at a little distance from him , as they walked side by side to the further end of the terrace . A loud and altered clank upon the pavement warned him , before he could discern what was passing there , that the man was coming back alone . Clennam lounged into the road , towards the railing ; and the man passed at a quick swing , with the end of his cloak thrown over his shoulder , singing a scrap of a French song . The whole vista had no one in it now but himself . The lounger had lounged out of view , and Miss Wade and Tattycoram were gone . More than ever bent on seeing what became of them , and on having some information to give his good friend , Mr Meagles , he went out at the further end of the terrace , looking cautiously about him . He rightly judged that , at first at all events , they would go in a contrary direction from their late companion . He soon saw them in a neighbouring bye - street , which was not a thoroughfare , evidently allowing time for the man to get well out of their way . They walked leisurely arm - in - arm down one side of the street , and returned on the opposite side . When they came back to the street - corner , they changed their pace for the pace of people with an object and a distance before them , and walked steadily away . Clennam , no less steadily , kept them in sight . They crossed the Strand , and passed through Covent Garden ( under the windows of his old lodging where dear Little Dorrit had come that night ) , and slanted away north - east , until they passed the great building whence Tattycoram derived her name , and turned into the Gray ’s Inn Road . Clennam was quite at home here , in right of Flora , not to mention the Patriarch and Pancks , and kept them in view with ease . He was beginning to wonder where they might be going next , when that wonder was lost in the greater wonder with which he saw them turn into the Patriarchal street . That wonder was in its turn swallowed up on the greater wonder with which he saw them stop at the Patriarchal door . A low double knock at the bright brass knocker , a gleam of light into the road from the opened door , a brief pause for inquiry and answer and the door was shut , and they were housed . After looking at the surrounding objects for assurance that he was not in an odd dream , and after pacing a little while before the house , Arthur knocked at the door . It was opened by the usual maid - servant , and she showed him up at once , with her usual alacrity , to Flora ’s sitting - room . There was no one with Flora but Mr F. ’s Aunt , which respectable gentlewoman , basking in a balmy atmosphere of tea and toast , was ensconced in an easy - chair by the fireside , with a little table at her elbow , and a clean white handkerchief spread over her lap on which two pieces of toast at that moment awaited consumption . Bending over a steaming vessel of tea , and looking through the steam , and breathing forth the steam , like a malignant Chinese enchantress engaged in the performance of unholy rites , Mr F. ’s Aunt put down her great teacup and exclaimed , ‘
267566	267628	267631	267631	Arthur	304	’ It would seem from the foregoing exclamation that this uncompromising relative of the lamented Mr F. , measuring time by the acuteness of her sensations and not by the clock , supposed Clennam to have lately gone away ; whereas at least a quarter of a year had elapsed since he had had the temerity to present himself before her . ‘
267633	267645	267646	267646	Doyce	374	’ cried Flora , rising to give him a cordial reception , ‘
267773	267814	267751	267751	himself	411	’re not remembered not that I expect you Arthur Doyce and Clennam to remember me why should I for the days are gone but bring another teacup here directly and tell her fresh toast and pray sit near the fire . ’
267865	267876	267878	267878	Flora	499	‘ And now pray tell me something all you know , ’
267887	268034	267878	267878	Flora	499	‘ about the good dear quiet little thing and all the changes of her fortunes carriage people now no doubt and horses without number most romantic , a coat of arms of course and wild beasts on their hind legs showing it as if it was a copy they had done with mouths from ear to ear good gracious , and has she her health which is the first consideration after all for what is wealth without it Mr F. himself so often saying when his twinges came that sixpence a day and find yourself and no gout so much preferable , not that he could have lived on anything like it being the last man or that the previous little thing though far too familiar an expression now had any tendency of that sort much too slight and small but looked so fragile bless her ? ’
268147	268160	268161	268161	he	304	‘ She is in Italy , with all her family , Flora , ’
268172	268179	268181	268181	Flora	499	‘ In Italy is she really ? ’
268183	268319	268181	268181	Flora	499	‘ with the grapes growing everywhere and lava necklaces and bracelets too that land of poetry with burning mountains picturesque beyond belief though if the organ - boys come away from the neighbourhood not to be scorched nobody can wonder being so young and bringing their white mice with them most humane , and is she really in that favoured land with nothing but blue about her and dying gladiators and Belvederes though Mr F. himself did not believe for his objection when in spirits was that the images could not be true there being no medium between expensive quantities of linen badly got up and all in creases and none whatever , which certainly does not seem probable though perhaps in consequence of the extremes of rich and poor which may account for it . ’
268334	268339	268341	268341	she	499	‘ Venice Preserved too , ’
268343	268431	268341	268341	she	499	‘ I think you have been there is it well or ill preserved for people differ so and Maccaroni if they really eat it like the conjurors why not cut it shorter , you are acquainted Arthur -- dear Doyce and Clennam at least not dear and most assuredly not Doyce for I have not the pleasure but pray excuse me -- acquainted I believe with Mantua what _ has _ it got to do with Mantua - making for I never have been able to conceive ? ’
268432	268446	268447	268447	Arthur	304	‘ I believe there is no connection , Flora , between the two , ’
268458	268536	268452	268452	she	6866	‘ Upon your word no is n’t there I never did but that ’s like me I run away with an idea and having none to spare I keep it , alas there was a time dear Arthur that is to say decidedly not dear nor Arthur neither but you understand me when one bright idea gilded the what’s - his - name horizon of et cetera but it is darkly clouded now and all is over . ’
268573	268628	268559	268559	Flora	499	‘ I have the greatest desire , Flora , to speak to some one who is now in this house -- with Mr Casby no doubt . Some one whom I saw come in , and who , in a misguided and deplorable way , has deserted the house of a friend of mine . ’
268629	268639	268641	268641	Flora	499	‘ Papa sees so many and such odd people , ’
268645	268701	268641	268641	Flora	499	‘ that I should n’t venture to go down for any one but you Arthur but for you I would willingly go down in a diving - bell much more a dining - room and will come back directly if you ’ll mind and at the same time not mind Mr F. ’s Aunt while I ’m
268704	268803	268641	268641	Flora	499	’ With those words and a parting glance , Flora bustled out , leaving Clennam under dreadful apprehension of this terrible charge . The first variation which manifested itself in Mr F. ’s Aunt ’s demeanour when she had finished her piece of toast , was a loud and prolonged sniff . Finding it impossible to avoid construing this demonstration into a defiance of himself , its gloomy significance being unmistakable , Clennam looked plaintively at the excellent though prejudiced lady from whom it emanated , in the hope that she might be disarmed by a meek submission . ‘
268811	268822	268641	268641	Flora	499	’ said Mr F. ’s Aunt , shivering with hostility . ‘
268826	268827	268641	268641	Flora	499	’ ‘
268829	268885	268886	268886	He	6867	’ was the crust of the piece of toast . Clennam accepted the boon with a look of gratitude , and held it in his hand under the pressure of a little embarrassment , which was not relieved when Mr F. ’s Aunt , elevating her voice into a cry of considerable power , exclaimed , ‘
268905	268972	268886	268886	He	6867	’ and , coming out of her chair , shook her venerable fist so very close to his nose as to tickle the surface . But for the timely return of Flora , to find him in this difficult situation , further consequences might have ensued . Flora , without the least discomposure or surprise , but congratulating the old lady in an approving manner on being ‘
268978	268987	268988	268988	He	6867	’ , handed her back to her chair . ‘
268997	269008	268994	268995	this chap	13933	’ said Mr F. ’s relation , on being reseated . ‘
269016	269017	268994	268995	this chap	13933	’ ‘
269031	269035	269029	269029	aunt	3374	’ returned Flora . ‘
269047	269061	269043	269043	I	0	’ said Mr F. ’s Aunt , glaring round Flora on her enemy . ‘
269089	269125	269126	269127	a chap	6871	’ Under a general pretence of helping him to this refreshment , Flora got him out on the staircase ; Mr F. ’s Aunt even then constantly reiterating , with inexpressible bitterness , that he was ‘
269129	269133	269126	269127	a chap	6871	’ and had a ‘
269137	269160	269126	269127	a chap	6871	’ and over and over again insisting on that equine provision being made for him which she had already so strongly prescribed . ‘
269173	269177	269179	269179	you	304	’ whispered Flora , ‘
269191	269248	269183	269183	your	304	’ With a sense of going down - stairs in a highly - ridiculous manner , Clennam descended in the required attitude , and only released his fair burden at the dining - room door ; indeed , even there she was rather difficult to be got rid of , remaining in his embrace to murmur , ‘
269263	269331	269332	269333	Mr Clennam	304	’ She accompanied Arthur into the room , where the Patriarch sat alone , with his list shoes on the fender , twirling his thumbs as if he had never left off . The youthful Patriarch , aged ten , looked out of his picture - frame above him with no calmer air than he . Both smooth heads were alike beaming , blundering , and bumpy . ‘
269366	269367	269368	269368	I	0	’ ‘
269374	269391	269368	269368	I	0	’ said Clennam , doing so , and looking round with a face of blank disappointment , ‘
269398	269399	269368	269368	I	0	’ ‘
269404	269411	269368	269368	I	0	’ said the Patriarch , sweetly . ‘
269416	269417	269368	269368	I	0	’ ‘
269426	269430	269418	269418	I	0	’ cried Flora . ‘
269437	269442	269418	269418	I	0	’ returned the Patriarch . ‘
269454	269455	269458	269458	sir	933	’ ‘
269460	269466	269458	269458	sir	933	’ demanded Clennam , anxiously , ‘
269472	269473	269468	269469	Miss Wade	305	’ ‘
269483	269488	269478	269478	you	304	’ returned Mr Casby . ‘
269492	269497	269481	269481	Wade	305	’ Arthur quickly returned , ‘
269504	269505	269506	269506	Wade	305	’ ‘
269508	269513	269506	269506	Wade	305	’ said Mr Casby . ‘
269519	269569	269517	269517	Wade	305	’ After looking at the philanthropic visage and the long silky white hair for a few seconds , during which Mr Casby twirled his thumbs , and smiled at the fire as if he were benevolently wishing it to burn him that he might forgive it , Arthur began : ‘
269577	269578	269575	269576	Mr Casby--	617	’ ‘
269585	269590	269575	269576	Mr Casby--	617	’ said the Patriarch , ‘
269594	269595	269572	269572	your	304	’ ‘
269653	269654	269666	269666	you	304	’ ‘
269659	269664	269666	269666	you	304	’ returned the Patriarch . ‘
269681	269682	269678	269679	Miss Wade	305	’ ‘
269689	269694	269678	269679	Miss Wade	305	’ said the Patriarch , ‘
269751	269763	269714	269716	the young woman	12153	’ Arthur assented , and said once more with new expression , ‘
269777	269778	269765	269765	you	304	’ ‘
269785	269793	269765	269765	you	304	’ exclaimed the Patriarch in sweet regret . ‘
269888	269917	269918	269919	Mr Casby	395	’ Clennam saw now , that he had as much hope of getting assistance out of the Portrait as out of the Patriarch ; but he said nevertheless : ‘
269991	269992	269982	269982	you	395	’ ‘
269995	270009	269982	269982	you	395	’ returned the Patriarch , shaking his big head with his utmost benevolence . ‘
270066	270067	270105	270105	You	933	’ ‘
270074	270078	270105	270105	You	933	’ said Clennam . ‘
270081	270098	270105	270105	You	933	’ assented the Patriarch , with a shining face as he philanthropically smiled at the fire , ‘
270122	270504	270505	270505	I	0	’ His turning of his smooth thumbs over one another as he sat there , was so typical to Clennam of the way in which he would make the subject revolve if it were pursued , never showing any new part of it nor allowing it to make the smallest advance , that it did much to help to convince him of his labour having been in vain . He might have taken any time to think about it , for Mr Casby , well accustomed to get on anywhere by leaving everything to his bumps and his white hair , knew his strength to lie in silence . So there Casby sat , twirling and twirling , and making his polished head and forehead look largely benevolent in every knob . With this spectacle before him , Arthur had risen to go , when from the inner Dock where the good ship Pancks was hove down when out in no cruising ground , the noise was heard of that steamer labouring towards him . It struck Arthur that the noise began demonstratively far off , as though Mr Pancks sought to impress on any one who might happen to think about it , that he was working on from out of hearing . Mr Pancks and he shook hands , and the former brought his employer a letter or two to sign . Mr Pancks in shaking hands merely scratched his eyebrow with his left forefinger and snorted once , but Clennam , who understood him better now than of old , comprehended that he had almost done for the evening and wished to say a word to him outside . Therefore , when he had taken his leave of Mr Casby , and ( which was a more difficult process ) of Flora , he sauntered in the neighbourhood on Mr Pancks ’s line of road . He had waited but a short time when Mr Pancks appeared . Mr Pancks shaking hands again with another expressive snort , and taking off his hat to put his hair up , Arthur thought he received his cue to speak to him as one who knew pretty well what had just now passed . Therefore he said , without any preface : ‘
270514	270515	270512	270512	Pancks	396	’ ‘
270518	270522	270512	270512	Pancks	396	’ replied Pancks . ‘
270528	270529	270523	270523	They	6899	’ ‘
270539	270540	270531	270531	he	6900	’ ‘
270550	270571	270572	270572	I	0	’ Mr Pancks did not ? No , Mr Pancks did not . Did Mr Pancks know anything about her ? ‘
270575	270580	270572	270572	I	0	’ rejoined that worthy , ‘
270657	270669	270670	270670	em	11450	‘ em in any street , she may make chance acquaintance of ‘
270684	270701	270680	270680	She	2783	‘ em . She knows nothing about any relative whatever . Never did . Never will . ’
270702	270711	270718	270718	Pancks	396	‘ Mr Casby could enlighten her , perhaps ? ’
270712	270716	270718	270718	Pancks	396	‘ May be , ’
270720	270820	270718	270718	Pancks	396	‘ I expect so , but do n’t know . He has long had money ( not overmuch as I make out ) in trust to dole out to her when she ca n’t do without it . Sometimes she ’s proud and wo n’t touch it for a length of time ; sometimes she ’s so poor that she must have it . She writhes under her life . A woman more angry , passionate , reckless , and revengeful never lived . She came for money to - night . Said she had peculiar occasion for it . ’
270821	270825	270827	270827	Clennam	304	‘ I think , ’
270830	270849	270827	270827	Clennam	304	‘ I by chance know what occasion -- I mean into whose pocket the money is to go . ’
270850	270853	270855	270855	Pancks	396	‘ Indeed ? ’
270857	270908	270855	270855	Pancks	396	‘ If it ’s a compact , I recommend that party to be exact in it . I would n’t trust myself to that woman , young and handsome as she is , if I had wronged her ; no , not for twice my proprietor ’s money ! Unless , ’
270916	270932	270933	270933	Arthur	304	‘ I had a lingering illness on me , and wanted to get it over . ’
270955	270962	270964	270964	Pancks	396	‘ The wonder is to me , ’
270966	271012	271013	271013	Arthur	304	‘ that she has never done for my proprietor , as the only person connected with her story she can lay hold of . Mentioning that , I may tell you , between ourselves , that I am sometimes tempted to do for him myself . ’
271018	271029	271013	271013	Arthur	304	‘ Dear me , Pancks , do n’t say that ! ’
271030	271034	271036	271036	Pancks	396	‘ Understand me , ’
271050	271079	271036	271036	Pancks	396	‘ I do n’t mean , cut his throat . But by all that ’s precious , if he goes too far , I ’ll cut his hair ! ’
271723	271730	271712	271714	the other passenger	6949	‘ Pardon ! Not my fault ! ’
272237	272262	272235	272235	himself	304	‘ Who passes by this road so late ? Compagnon de la Majolaine ; Who passes by this road so late ? Always gay ! ’
272269	272276	272278	272278	Arthur	304	‘ You are impatient , sir , ’
272280	272293	272295	272296	the stranger	10503	‘ I am , sir . Death of my life , sir , ’
272298	272307	272295	272296	the stranger	10503	‘ it ’s my character to be impatient ! ’
272360	272365	272366	272366	she	312	‘ Why , Arthur ! ’
272375	272388	272389	272389	she	312	‘ Not you sure ? Ah , Lord save us ! No , ’
272397	272401	272389	272389	she	312	‘ Him again ! ’
272402	272414	272416	272417	the stranger	10503	‘ It ’s true ! Him again , dear Mrs Flintwinch , ’
272419	272450	272416	272417	the stranger	10503	‘ Open the door , and let me take my dear friend Jeremiah to my arms ! Open the door , and let me hasten myself to embrace my Flintwinch ! ’
272451	272458	272460	272460	Affery	312	‘ He ’s not at home , ’
272462	272466	272468	272469	the stranger	10503	‘ Fetch him ! ’
272471	272555	272468	272469	the stranger	10503	‘ Fetch my Flintwinch ! Tell him that it is his old Blandois , who comes from arriving in England ; tell him that it is his little boy who is here , his cabbage , his well - beloved ! Open the door , beautiful Mrs Flintwinch , and in the meantime let me to pass upstairs , to present my compliments -- homage of Blandois -- to my lady ! My lady lives always ? It is well . Open then ! ’
272615	272632	272634	272635	the stranger	10503	‘ Despatch then ! Achieve then ! Bring my Flintwinch ! Announce me to my lady ! ’
272643	272650	272652	272652	Arthur	304	‘ Pray tell me , Affery , ’
272668	272674	272658	272658	he	304	‘ who is this gentleman ? ’

272690	272702	272683	272684	the stranger	10503	‘ who -- ha , ha , ha!--who is this gentleman ? ’
272715	272731	272711	272711	her	313	‘ Affery , let them both come up . Arthur , come straight to me ! ’
272732	272735	272737	272737	Blandois	618	‘ Arthur ? ’
272764	272784	272785	272785	Arthur	304	‘ The son of my lady ? I am the all - devoted of the son of my lady ! ’

282546	282585	282531	282531	he	623	’ this sparkling young Barnacle threw off the phrase sportively , as who should say , We know all about these forms of speech , but we must keep it up , we must keep the game alive ; ‘

282681	282682	282679	282679	Ferdinand	623	’ ‘
282695	282700	282679	282679	Ferdinand	623	’ returned that gentleman ; ‘
282923	282933	282934	282934	You	7273	’ said this handsome young Barnacle , laughing heartily , ‘
283016	283207	282996	282996	I	0	’ The pleasant young Barnacle finished by once more laughing heartily . He was a very easy , pleasant fellow indeed , and his manners were exceedingly winning . Mr Tite Barnacle ’s view of the business was of a less airy character . He took it ill that Mr Dorrit had troubled the Department by wanting to pay the money , and considered it a grossly informal thing to do after so many years . But Mr Tite Barnacle was a buttoned - up man , and consequently a weighty one . All buttoned - up men are weighty . All buttoned - up men are believed in . Whether or no the reserved and never - exercised power of unbuttoning , fascinates mankind ; whether or no wisdom is supposed to condense and augment when buttoned up , and to evaporate when unbuttoned ; it is certain that the man to whom importance is accorded is the buttoned - up man . Mr Tite Barnacle never would have passed for half his current value , unless his coat had been always buttoned - up to his white cravat . ‘
283212	283217	283209	283209	I	0	’ said Lord Decimus , ‘
283229	283238	283239	283239	He	633	’ Nobody else replying , the host said , ‘
283247	283248	283241	283242	two daughters	13766	’ ‘
283257	283262	283251	283251	you	0	’ asked Lord Decimus . ‘
283276	283281	283267	283268	Mr Sparkler	472	’ said Mr Merdle , ‘
283311	283726	283727	283727	Your	7282	’ Here Mr Merdle stopped , and looked at the table - cloth , as he usually did when he found himself observed or listened to . Bar was uncommonly pleased to find that the Merdle family , and this family , had already been brought into contact . He submitted , in a low voice across the table to Bishop , that it was a kind of analogical illustration of those physical laws , in virtue of which Like flies to Like . He regarded this power of attraction in wealth to draw wealth to it , as something remarkably interesting and curious -- something indefinably allied to the loadstone and gravitation . Bishop , who had ambled back to earth again when the present theme was broached , acquiesced . He said it was indeed highly important to Society that one in the trying situation of unexpectedly finding himself invested with a power for good or for evil in Society , should become , as it were , merged in the superior power of a more legitimate and more gigantic growth , the influence of which ( as in the case of our friend at whose board we sat ) was habitually exercised in harmony with the best interests of Society . Thus , instead of two rival and contending flames , a larger and a lesser , each burning with a lurid and uncertain glare , we had a blended and a softened light whose genial ray diffused an equable warmth throughout the land . Bishop seemed to like his own way of putting the case very much , and rather dwelt upon it ; Bar , meanwhile ( not to throw away a jury - man ) , making a show of sitting at his feet and feeding on his precepts . The dinner and dessert being three hours long , the bashful Member cooled in the shadow of Lord Decimus faster than he warmed with food and drink , and had but a chilly time of it . Lord Decimus , like a tall tower in a flat country , seemed to project himself across the table - cloth , hide the light from the honourable Member , cool the honourable Member ’s marrow , and give him a woeful idea of distance . When he asked this unfortunate traveller to take wine , he encompassed his faltering steps with the gloomiest of shades ; and when he said , ‘
283731	283897	283727	283727	Your	7282	’ all around him was barrenness and desolation . At length Lord Decimus , with a coffee - cup in his hand , began to hover about among the pictures , and to cause an interesting speculation to arise in all minds as to the probabilities of his ceasing to hover , and enabling the smaller birds to flutter up - stairs ; which could not be done until he had urged his noble pinions in that direction . After some delay , and several stretches of his wings which came to nothing , he soared to the drawing - rooms . And here a difficulty arose , which always does arise when two people are specially brought together at a dinner to confer with one another . Everybody ( except Bishop , who had no suspicion of it ) knew perfectly well that this dinner had been eaten and drunk , specifically to the end that Lord Decimus and Mr Merdle should have five minutes ’
284025	284036	284038	284038	Ferdinand	623	‘ Did you ever see such a thing as this ? ’
284049	284052	284054	284054	Bar	479	‘ Often , ’

284096	284111	284094	284094	Bar	479	‘ I ’ll butt Merdle , if you like ; but not my lord . ’

284136	284167	284129	284129	he	623	‘ I want to get away . Why the deuce ca n’t they come together ! They both know what they want and mean to do . Look at them ! ’
284255	284271	284273	284273	Ferdinand	623	‘ I must get Merdle ’s doctor to catch and secure him , I suppose , ’
284275	284304	284273	284273	Ferdinand	623	‘ and then I must lay hold of my illustrious kinsman , and decoy him if I can -- drag him if I can’t -- to the conference . ’
284305	284313	284315	284315	Bar	479	‘ Since you do me the honour , ’

284404	285008	285009	285009	Ferdinand	623	’ said Bar . Bar was a sight wondrous to behold , and full of matter , when , jauntily waving his double eye - glass by its ribbon , and jauntily drooping to an Universe of Jurymen , he , in the most accidental manner ever seen , found himself at Mr Merdle ’s shoulder , and embraced that opportunity of mentioning a little point to him , on which he particularly wished to be guided by the light of his practical knowledge . ( Here he took Mr Merdle ’s arm and walked him gently away . ) A banker , whom we would call A. B. , advanced a considerable sum of money , which we would call fifteen thousand pounds , to a client or customer of his , whom he would call P. Q. ( Here , as they were getting towards Lord Decimus , he held Mr Merdle tight . ) As a security for the repayment of this advance to P. Q. whom we would call a widow lady , there were placed in A. B. ’s hands the title - deeds of a freehold estate , which we would call Blinkiter Doddles . Now , the point was this . A limited right of felling and lopping in the woods of Blinkiter Doddles , lay in the son of P. Q. then past his majority , and whom we would call X. Y.--but really this was too bad ! In the presence of Lord Decimus , to detain the host with chopping our dry chaff of law , was really too bad ! Another time ! Bar was truly repentant , and would not say another syllable . Would Bishop favour him with half - a - dozen words ? ( He had now set Mr Merdle down on a couch , side by side with Lord Decimus , and to it they must go , now or never . ) And now the rest of the company , highly excited and interested , always excepting Bishop , who had not the slightest idea that anything was going on , formed in one group round the fire in the next drawing - room , and pretended to be chatting easily on the infinite variety of small topics , while everybody ’s thoughts and eyes were secretly straying towards the secluded pair . The Chorus were excessively nervous , perhaps as labouring under the dreadful apprehension that some good thing was going to be diverted from them ! Bishop alone talked steadily and evenly . He conversed with the great Physician on that relaxation of the throat with which young curates were too frequently afflicted , and on the means of lessening the great prevalence of that disorder in the church . Physician , as a general rule , was of opinion that the best way to avoid it was to know how to read , before you made a profession of reading . Bishop said dubiously , did he really think so ? And Physician said , decidedly , yes he did . Ferdinand , meanwhile , was the only one of the party who skirmished on the outside of the circle ; he kept about mid - way between it and the two , as if some sort of surgical operation were being performed by Lord Decimus on Mr Merdle , or by Mr Merdle on Lord Decimus , and his services might at any moment be required as Dresser . In fact , within a quarter of an hour Lord Decimus called to him ‘
285011	285082	285009	285009	Ferdinand	623	’ and he went , and took his place in the conference for some five minutes more . Then a half - suppressed gasp broke out among the Chorus ; for Lord Decimus rose to take his leave . Again coached up by Ferdinand to the point of making himself popular , he shook hands in the most brilliant manner with the whole company , and even said to Bar , ‘
285093	285099	285100	285100	Eton	213	’ To which Bar retorted , ‘
285108	286151	285106	285106	Parliamentary	564	’ neatly showing that he had mastered the joke , and delicately insinuating that he could never forget it while his life remained . All the grave importance that was buttoned up in Mr Tite Barnacle , took itself away next ; and Ferdinand took himself away next , to the opera . Some of the rest lingered a little , marrying golden liqueur glasses to Buhl tables with sticky rings ; on the desperate chance of Mr Merdle ’s saying something . But Merdle , as usual , oozed sluggishly and muddily about his drawing - room , saying never a word . In a day or two it was announced to all the town , that Edmund Sparkler , Esquire , son - in - law of the eminent Mr Merdle of worldwide renown , was made one of the Lords of the Circumlocution Office ; and proclamation was issued , to all true believers , that this admirable appointment was to be hailed as a graceful and gracious mark of homage , rendered by the graceful and gracious Decimus , to that commercial interest which must ever in a great commercial country -- and all the rest of it , with blast of trumpet . So , bolstered by this mark of Government homage , the wonderful Bank and all the other wonderful undertakings went on and went up ; and gapers came to Harley Street , Cavendish Square , only to look at the house where the golden wonder lived . And when they saw the Chief Butler looking out at the hall - door in his moments of condescension , the gapers said how rich he looked , and wondered how much money he had in the wonderful Bank . But , if they had known that respectable Nemesis better , they would not have wondered about it , and might have stated the amount with the utmost precision . CHAPTER 13 . The Progress of an Epidemic That it is at least as difficult to stay a moral infection as a physical one ; that such a disease will spread with the malignity and rapidity of the Plague ; that the contagion , when it has once made head , will spare no pursuit or condition , but will lay hold on people in the soundest health , and become developed in the most unlikely constitutions : is a fact as firmly established by experience as that we human creatures breathe an atmosphere . A blessing beyond appreciation would be conferred upon mankind , if the tainted , in whose weakness or wickedness these virulent disorders are bred , could be instantly seized and placed in close confinement ( not to say summarily smothered ) before the poison is communicable . As a vast fire will fill the air to a great distance with its roar , so the sacred flame which the mighty Barnacles had fanned caused the air to resound more and more with the name of Merdle . It was deposited on every lip , and carried into every ear . There never was , there never had been , there never again should be , such a man as Mr Merdle . Nobody , as aforesaid , knew what he had done ; but everybody knew him to be the greatest that had appeared . Down in Bleeding Heart Yard , where there was not one unappropriated halfpenny , as lively an interest was taken in this paragon of men as on the Stock Exchange . Mrs Plornish , now established in the small grocery and general trade in a snug little shop at the crack end of the Yard , at the top of the steps , with her little old father and Maggy acting as assistants , habitually held forth about him over the counter in conversation with her customers . Mr Plornish , who had a small share in a small builder ’s business in the neighbourhood , said , trowel in hand , on the tops of scaffolds and on the tiles of houses , that people did tell him as Mr Merdle was _ the _ one , mind you , to put us all to rights in respects of that which all on us looked to , and to bring us all safe home as much as we needed , mind you , fur toe be brought . Mr Baptist , sole lodger of Mr and Mrs Plornish was reputed in whispers to lay by the savings which were the result of his simple and moderate life , for investment in one of Mr Merdle ’s certain enterprises . The female Bleeding Hearts , when they came for ounces of tea , and hundredweights of talk , gave Mrs Plornish to understand , That how , ma’am , they had heard from their cousin Mary Anne , which worked in the line , that his lady ’s dresses would fill three waggons . That how she was as handsome a lady , ma’am , as lived , no matter where s , and a busk like marble itself . That how , according to what they was told , ma’am , it was her son by a former husband as was took into the Government ; and a General he had been , and armies he had marched again and victory crowned , if all you heard was to be believed . That how it was reported that Mr Merdle ’s words had been , that if they could have made it worth his while to take the whole Government he would have took it without a profit , but that take it he could not and stand a loss . That how it was not to be expected , ma’am , that he should lose by it , his ways being , as you might say and utter no falsehood , paved with gold ; but that how it was much to be regretted that something handsome had n’t been got up to make it worth his while ; for it was such and only such that knowed the heighth to which the bread and butchers ’

286252	286262	286263	286263	Defaulter	640	‘ I have n’t got it , Mr Pancks , ’
286267	286296	286263	286263	Defaulter	640	‘ I tell you the truth , sir , when I say I have n’t got so much as a single sixpence of it to bless myself with . ’
286297	286306	286307	286308	Mr Pancks	396	‘ This wo n’t do , you know , ’
286312	286326	286327	286327	Defaulter	640	‘ You do n’t expect it _ will _ do ; do you ? ’
286336	286341	286327	286327	Defaulter	640	‘ No , sir , ’
286347	286360	286327	286327	Defaulter	640	‘ My proprietor is n’t going to stand this , you know , ’
286366	286381	286361	286362	Mr Pancks	396	‘ He do n’t send me here for this . Pay up ! Come ! ’
286388	286428	286382	286383	The Defaulter	7300	‘ Ah , Mr Pancks . If I was the rich gentleman whose name is in everybody ’s mouth -- if my name was Merdle , sir -- I’d soon pay up , and be glad to do it . ’
286499	286524	286525	286526	the Defaulter	7300	‘ If I was Mr Merdle , sir , you would n’t have cause to complain of me then . No , believe me ! ’
286536	286557	286525	286526	the Defaulter	7300	‘ I ’d pay up so quick then , Mr Pancks , that you should n’t have to ask me . ’
286603	286649	286598	286598	he	396	‘ Well ! You ’ll have the broker in , and be turned out ; that ’s what ’ll happen to you . It ’s no use talking to me about Mr Merdle . You are not Mr Merdle , any more than I am . ’
286650	286655	286656	286657	the Defaulter	7300	‘ No , sir , ’
286661	286673	286656	286657	the Defaulter	7300	‘ I only wish you _ were _ him , sir . ’
286687	286698	286656	286657	the Defaulter	7300	‘ Only wish you _ were _ him , sir . ’
286699	286714	286715	286716	the Defaulter	7300	‘ You ’d be easier with us if you were Mr Merdle , sir , ’
286724	286805	286715	286716	the Defaulter	7300	‘ and it would be better for all parties . Better for our sakes , and better for yours , too . You would n’t have to worry no one , then , sir . You would n’t have to worry us , and you would n’t have to worry yourself . You ’d be easier in your own mind , sir , and you ’d leave others easier , too , you would , if you were Mr Merdle . ’
287410	287420	287422	287422	she	387	‘ I guessed it was you , Mr Pancks , ’
287424	287516	287518	287519	Mrs Plornish	387	‘ for it ’s quite your regular night ; ai n’t it ? Here ’s father , you see , come out to serve at the sound of the bell , like a brisk young shopman . Ai n’t he looking well ? Father ’s more pleased to see you than if you was a customer , for he dearly loves a gossip ; and when it turns upon Miss Dorrit , he loves it all the more . You never heard father in such voice as he is at present , ’
287533	287598	287526	287526	she	387	‘ He gave us Strephon last night to that degree that Plornish gets up and makes him this speech across the table . “ John Edward Nandy , ” says Plornish to father , “ I never heard you come the warbles as I have heard you come the warbles this night . ” An’t it gratifying , Mr Pancks , though ; really ? ’
287726	287731	287703	287703	he	396	‘ Merdle , Millions . ’
287732	287745	287747	287747	Pancks	396	‘ And how are _ you _ getting on , Mrs Plornish , ’
287749	287752	287703	287703	he	396	‘ since we ’re
287756	287757	287747	287747	Pancks	396	’ ‘
287765	287770	287763	287763	sir	933	’ returned Mrs Plornish . ‘
287797	287863	287773	287773	dear	971	’ John Edward Nandy trotted away , much gratified , to comply with his daughter ’s request . Mrs Plornish , who was always in mortal terror of mentioning pecuniary affairs before the old gentleman , lest any disclosure she made might rouse his spirit and induce him to run away to the workhouse , was thus left free to be confidential with Mr Pancks . ‘
287876	287885	287703	287703	he	396	’ said Mrs Plornish , lowering her voice ; ‘
287907	288467	288468	288468	Hallo	399	’ This drawback , rather severely felt by most people who engaged in commercial transactions with the inhabitants of Bleeding Heart Yard , was a large stumbling - block in Mrs Plornish ’s trade . When Mr Dorrit had established her in the business , the Bleeding Hearts had shown an amount of emotion and a determination to support her in it , that did honour to human nature . Recognising her claim upon their generous feelings as one who had long been a member of their community , they pledged themselves , with great feeling , to deal with Mrs Plornish , come what would and bestow their patronage on no other establishment . Influenced by these noble sentiments , they had even gone out of their way to purchase little luxuries in the grocery and butter line to which they were unaccustomed ; saying to one another , that if they did stretch a point , was it not for a neighbour and a friend , and for whom ought a point to be stretched if not for such ? So stimulated , the business was extremely brisk , and the articles in stock went off with the greatest celerity . In short , if the Bleeding Hearts had but paid , the undertaking would have been a complete success ; whereas , by reason of their exclusively confining themselves to owing , the profits actually realised had not yet begun to appear in the books . Mr Pancks was making a very porcupine of himself by sticking his hair up in the contemplation of this state of accounts , when old Mr Nandy , re - entering the cottage with an air of mystery , entreated them to come and look at the strange behaviour of Mr Baptist , who seemed to have met with something that had scared him . All three going into the shop , and watching through the window , then saw Mr Baptist , pale and agitated , go through the following extraordinary performances . First , he was observed hiding at the top of the steps leading down into the Yard , and peeping up and down the street with his head cautiously thrust out close to the side of the shop - door . After very anxious scrutiny , he came out of his retreat , and went briskly down the street as if he were going away altogether ; then , suddenly turned about , and went , at the same pace , and with the same feint , up the street . He had gone no further up the street than he had gone down , when he crossed the road and disappeared . The object of this last manoeuvre was only apparent , when his entering the shop with a sudden twist , from the steps again , explained that he had made a wide and obscure circuit round to the other , or Doyce and Clennam , end of the Yard , and had come through the Yard and bolted in . He was out of breath by that time , as he might well be , and his heart seemed to jerk faster than the little shop - bell , as it quivered and jingled behind him with his hasty shutting of the door . ‘
288473	288478	288468	288468	Hallo	399	’ said Mr Pancks . ‘
288489	288542	288543	288543	E	7352	’ Mr Baptist , or Signor Cavalletto , understood English now almost as well as Mr Pancks himself , and could speak it very well too . Nevertheless , Mrs Plornish , with a pardonable vanity in that accomplishment of hers which made her all but Italian , stepped in as interpreter . ‘
288547	288552	288543	288543	E	7352	’ said Mrs Plornish , ‘
288557	288558	288543	288543	E	7352	’ ‘
288568	288588	288543	288543	E	7352	’ returned Mr Baptist , imparting great stealthiness to his flurried back - handed shake of his right forefinger . ‘
288592	288640	288543	288543	E	7352	’ Mrs Plornish was proud of the title Padrona , which she regarded as signifying : not so much Mistress of the house , as Mistress of the Italian tongue . She immediately complied with Mr Baptist ’s request , and they all went into the cottage . ‘
288647	288667	288643	288643	you	7355	’ said Mrs Plornish then , interpreting Mr Pancks in a new way with her usual fertility of resource . ‘
288674	288675	288676	288676	I	0	’ ‘
288682	288686	288676	288676	I	0	’ returned Baptist . ‘
288692	288693	288694	288694	I	0	’ ‘
288700	288705	288706	288708	A bad man	7357	’ asked Mrs Plornish . ‘
288725	288726	288718	288718	I	0	’ ‘
288733	288738	288728	288728	you	0	’ asked Mrs Plornish . ‘
288752	288753	288754	288754	E	0	’ ‘
288758	288763	288754	288754	E	0	’ asked Mrs Plornish . ‘
288774	288775	288776	288776	He	1350	’ ‘
288779	288794	288776	288776	He	1350	’ Mrs Plornish then interpreted , addressing her father and Pancks with mild condescension , ‘
288816	288827	288806	288808	the bad man	7360	’ inquired Mrs Plornish , reverting to the Italian language , ‘
288835	288836	288837	288837	Padrona	643	’ ‘
288841	288852	288837	288837	Padrona	643	’ returned the little foreigner whom she so considerately protected , ‘
288904	289494	289503	289503	me	0	’ The topic was so disagreeable to him , and so put his usual liveliness to the rout , that Mrs Plornish forbore to press him further : the rather as the tea had been drawing for some time on the hob . But she was not the less surprised and curious for asking no more questions ; neither was Mr Pancks , whose expressive breathing had been labouring hard since the entrance of the little man , like a locomotive engine with a great load getting up a steep incline . Maggy , now better dressed than of yore , though still faithful to the monstrous character of her cap , had been in the background from the first with open mouth and eyes , which staring and gaping features were not diminished in breadth by the untimely suppression of the subject . However , no more was said about it , though much appeared to be thought on all sides : by no means excepting the two young Plornishes , who partook of the evening meal as if their eating the bread and butter were rendered almost superfluous by the painful probability of the worst of men shortly presenting himself for the purpose of eating them . Mr Baptist , by degrees began to chirp a little ; but never stirred from the seat he had taken behind the door and close to the window , though it was not his usual place . As often as the little bell rang , he started and peeped out secretly , with the end of the little curtain in his hand and the rest before his face ; evidently not at all satisfied but that the man he dreaded had tracked him through all his doublings and turnings , with the certainty of a terrible bloodhound . The entrance , at various times , of two or three customers and of Mr Plornish , gave Mr Baptist just enough of this employment to keep the attention of the company fixed upon him . Tea was over , and the children were abed , and Mrs Plornish was feeling her way to the dutiful proposal that her father should favour them with Chloe , when the bell rang again , and Mr Clennam came in . Clennam had been poring late over his books and letters ; for the waiting - rooms of the Circumlocution Office ravaged his time sorely . Over and above that , he was depressed and made uneasy by the late occurrence at his mother ’s . He looked worn and solitary . He felt so , too ; but , nevertheless , was returning home from his counting - house by that end of the Yard to give them the intelligence that he had received another letter from Miss Dorrit . The news made a sensation in the cottage which drew off the general attention from Mr Baptist . Maggy , who pushed her way into the foreground immediately , would have seemed to draw in the tidings of her Little Mother equally at her ears , nose , mouth , and eyes , but that the last were obstructed by tears . She was particularly delighted when Clennam assured her that there were hospitals , and very kindly conducted hospitals , in Rome . Mr Pancks rose into new distinction in virtue of being specially remembered in the letter . Everybody was pleased and interested , and Clennam was well repaid for his trouble . ‘
289511	289516	289503	289503	me	0	’ said Mrs Plornish , ‘
289550	289587	289588	289590	John Edward Nandy	547	’ Mr Plornish deeming it incumbent on him , as host , to add his personal acknowledgments , tendered them in the form which always expressed his highest ideal of a combination of ceremony with sincerity . ‘
289592	289602	289603	289603	Sir	933	’ said Mr Plornish , addressing the old gentleman . ‘
289645	289654	289657	289658	Mr Nandy	541	‘ em , it follows serve you right . ’
289661	289747	289657	289658	Mr Nandy	541	‘ I am heartily of your opinion , Thomas , and which your opinion is the same as mine , and therefore no more words and not being backwards with that opinion , which opinion giving it as yes , Thomas , yes , is the opinion in which yourself and me must ever be unanimously jined by all , and where there is not difference of opinion there can be none but one opinion , which fully no , Thomas , Thomas , no ! ’
289852	289863	289865	289865	Arthur	304	‘ If you will come home with me , Pancks , ’
289874	289908	289865	289865	Arthur	304	‘ and will share what dinner or supper there is , it will be next door to an act of charity ; for I am weary and out of sorts to - night . ’
289909	289920	289922	289922	Pancks	396	‘ Ask me to do a greater thing than that , ’
289924	289937	289922	289922	Pancks	396	‘ when you want it done , and I ’ll do it . ’
290109	290115	290116	290116	Arthur	304	‘ I am quite alone , ’
290123	290150	290116	290116	Arthur	304	‘ My partner is away , busily engaged at a distance on his branch of our business , and you shall do just as you like . ’
290151	290170	290172	290172	Pancks	396	‘ Thank you . You did n’t take particular notice of little Altro just now ; did you ? ’
290174	290179	290172	290172	Pancks	396	‘ No . Why ? ’
290180	290192	290194	290194	Pancks	396	‘ He ’s a bright fellow , and I like him , ’
290196	290220	290194	290194	Pancks	396	‘ Something has gone amiss with him to - day . Have you any idea of any cause that can have overset him ? ’
290221	290229	290230	290231	Mr Pancks	396	‘ You surprise me ! None whatever . ’
290256	290263	290265	290265	Pancks	396	‘ Perhaps you ’ll ask him , ’
290267	290274	290265	290265	Pancks	396	‘ as he ’s a stranger ? ’
290275	290280	290282	290282	Clennam	304	‘ Ask him what ? ’
290284	290292	290282	290282	Clennam	304	‘ What he has on his mind . ’
290293	290312	290314	290314	Clennam	304	‘ I ought first to see for myself that he has something on his mind , I think , ’
290316	290354	290314	290314	Clennam	304	‘ I have found him in every way so diligent , so grateful ( for little enough ) , and so trustworthy , that it might look like suspecting him . And that would be very unjust . ’
290355	290358	290360	290360	Pancks	396	‘ True , ’
290362	290381	290360	290360	Pancks	396	‘ But , I say ! You ought n’t to be anybody ’s proprietor , Mr Clennam . You ’re
290386	290387	290360	290360	Pancks	396	’ ‘
290394	290399	290314	290314	Clennam	304	’ returned Clennam laughing , ‘
290522	290523	290475	290475	his	7382	’ ‘
290526	290534	290475	290475	his	7382	’ retorted Pancks , with a snort . ‘
290538	290539	290475	290475	his	7382	’ ‘
290544	290545	290475	290475	his	7382	’ ‘
290550	290554	290475	290475	his	7382	’ said Pancks . ‘
290569	290742	290563	290563	you	396	’ His quick way of replying caused Clennam to look at him , with a doubt whether he meant more than he said . As it was accompanied , however , with a quickening of his pace and a corresponding increase in the labouring of his machinery , Arthur did not pursue the matter , and they soon arrived at his house . A dinner of soup and a pigeon - pie , served on a little round table before the fire , and flavoured with a bottle of good wine , oiled Mr Pancks ’s works in a highly effective manner ; so that when Clennam produced his Eastern pipe , and handed Mr Pancks another Eastern pipe , the latter gentleman was perfectly comfortable . They puffed for a while in silence , Mr Pancks like a steam - vessel with wind , tide , calm water , and all other sea - going conditions in her favour . He was the first to speak , and he spoke thus : ‘
290750	290759	290563	290563	you	396	’ Clennam , with his former look , said ‘
290762	290763	290563	290563	you	396	’ ‘
290774	290778	290771	290771	you	7392	’ said Pancks . ‘
290790	290797	290783	290783	you	0	’ returned Clennam , wondering why . ‘
290816	290823	290805	290805	they	7393	’ said Pancks as he smoked . ‘

290906	290910	290885	290885	Merdle	273	’ said Arthur . ‘
290914	290938	290885	290885	Merdle	273	’ returned Pancks . After smoking for a minute or so , more drily than comported with his recent oiling , he added : ‘
290950	290951	290942	290943	these people	934	’ ‘
290956	290960	290942	290943	these people	934	’ assented Clennam . ‘
290965	290969	290942	290943	these people	934	’ cried Pancks . ‘
290992	290993	290990	290990	sir	933	’ ‘
290997	291033	291035	291035	they	7393	’ Clennam was going on to say ; when Mr Pancks , without change of countenance , produced a sound so far surpassing all his usual efforts , nasal or bronchial , that he stopped . ‘
291038	291046	291035	291035	they	7393	’ repeated Pancks in an inquiring tone . ‘
291053	291065	291049	291049	you	933	’ said Arthur , hesitating what name to give the interruption . ‘
291070	291074	291049	291049	you	933	’ said Pancks . ‘
291088	291089	291091	291091	they	7393	’ ‘
291094	291111	291091	291091	they	7393	’ observed Clennam , who was a little at a loss how to take his friend , ‘
291122	291123	291116	291116	they	7393	’ ‘
291130	291159	291127	291128	Mr Clennam	304	’ Pancks asked quickly , and with an odd effect of having been from the commencement of the conversation loaded with the heavy charge he now fired off . ‘
291161	291176	291127	291128	Mr Clennam	304	’re right , you know . They do n’t mean to be , but they ’re
291179	291180	291127	291128	Mr Clennam	304	’ ‘
291193	291194	291190	291191	Mr Merdle	273	’ ‘
291201	291205	291190	291191	Mr Merdle	273	’ said Pancks . ‘
291224	291229	291190	291191	Mr Merdle	273	’re safe and genuine . ’
291306	291315	291317	291317	Clennam	304	‘ Do you mean , my good Pancks , ’
291320	291345	291317	291317	Clennam	304	‘ that you would put that thousand pounds of yours , let us say , for instance , out at this kind of interest ? ’
291346	291349	291351	291351	Pancks	396	‘ Certainly , ’
291353	291360	291351	291351	Pancks	396	‘ Already done it , sir . ’
291379	291393	291395	291395	Pancks	396	‘ I tell you , Mr Clennam , I ’ve gone into it , ’
291397	291413	291395	291395	Pancks	396	‘ He ’s a man of immense resources -- enormous capital -- government influence . They ’re
291420	291424	291419	291419	They	7399	’re safe . They ’re
291427	291428	291419	291419	They	7399	’ ‘
291431	291447	291419	291419	They	7399	’ returned Clennam , looking first at him gravely and then at the fire gravely . ‘
291452	291453	291448	291448	You	396	’ ‘
291456	291460	291448	291448	You	396	’ Pancks retorted . ‘
291486	291595	291480	291480	you	933	’ Of whom Mr Pancks had taken the prevalent disease , he could no more have told than if he had unconsciously taken a fever . Bred at first , as many physical diseases are , in the wickedness of men , and then disseminated in their ignorance , these epidemics , after a period , get communicated to many sufferers who are neither ignorant nor wicked . Mr Pancks might , or might not , have caught the illness himself from a subject of this class ; but in this category he appeared before Clennam , and the infection he threw off was all the more virulent . ‘
291602	291611	291480	291480	you	933	’ Clennam had already passed to that word , ‘
291618	291619	291597	291597	you	396	’ ‘
291626	291637	291597	291597	you	396	’ replied Pancks boldly , with a puff of smoke . ‘
291644	291773	291788	291788	Doyce	374	’ Now , Clennam had two subjects lying heavy on his lonely mind that night ; the one , his partner ’s long - deferred hope ; the other , what he had seen and heard at his mother ’s . In the relief of having this companion , and of feeling that he could trust him , he passed on to both , and both brought him round again , with an increase and acceleration of force , to his point of departure . It came about in the simplest manner . Quitting the investment subject , after an interval of silent looking at the fire through the smoke of his pipe , he told Pancks how and why he was occupied with the great National Department . ‘
291790	291807	291788	291788	Doyce	374	’ he finished by saying , with all the honest feeling the topic roused in him . ‘
291811	291815	291788	291788	Doyce	374	’ Pancks acquiesced . ‘
291825	291826	291817	291817	you	7402	’ ‘
291832	291833	291829	291829	you	7402	’ ‘
291842	291843	291829	291829	you	7402	’ ‘
291852	291853	291829	291829	you	7402	’ ‘
291860	291864	291858	291858	sir	933	’ said Pancks . ‘
291902	291903	291895	291895	He	7403	’ ‘
291911	291917	291906	291906	my	0	’ returned Clennam , uneasily . ‘
291949	291950	291944	291944	I	0	’ ‘
291954	291958	291944	291944	I	0	’ cried Pancks . ‘
291963	292009	291944	291944	I	0	’ There was something so indubitably genuine in the wonderful laugh , and series of snorts and puffs , engendered in Mr Pancks ’s astonishment at , and utter rejection of , the idea , that his being quite in earnest could not be questioned . ‘
292013	292017	291944	291944	I	0	’ cried Pancks . ‘
292032	292112	292030	292030	him	7403	’ The positive refusal expressed in Mr Pancks ’s continued snorts , no less than in these exclamations , to entertain the sentiment for a single instant , drove Arthur away from it . Indeed , he was fearful of something happening to Mr Pancks in the violent conflict that took place between the breath he jerked out of himself and the smoke he jerked into himself . This abandonment of the second topic threw him on the third . ‘
292124	292135	292030	292030	him	7403	’ he said , when there was a favourable pause , ‘
292185	292186	292177	292177	I	0	’ ‘
292192	292196	292187	292187	You	396	’ said Pancks , ‘
292205	292206	292207	292207	I	0	’ ‘
292210	292211	292207	292207	I	0	’ ‘
292215	292380	292207	292207	I	0	’ Mr Pancks ’s short and sharp rejoinder , confirmed by the sudden outstretching of his coaly hand , was most expressive and convincing . Arthur shook the hand warmly . He then , softening the nature of his old apprehensions as much as was possible consistently with their being made intelligible and never alluding to his mother by name , but speaking vaguely of a relation of his , confided to Mr Pancks a broad outline of the misgivings he entertained , and of the interview he had witnessed . Mr Pancks listened with such interest that , regardless of the charms of the Eastern pipe , he put it in the grate among the fire - irons , and occupied his hands during the whole recital in so erecting the loops and hooks of hair all over his head , that he looked , when it came to a conclusion , like a journeyman Hamlet in conversation with his father ’s spirit . ‘
292387	292402	292207	292207	I	0	’ was his exclamation then , with a startling touch on Clennam ’s knee , ‘
292468	292481	292486	292486	you	933	’ Arthur shook his head , but looked at him thoughtfully too . ‘
292491	292507	292512	292512	you	933	’ Pancks adjured him with a powerful concentration of all his energies on the advice . ‘
292570	292571	292561	292561	You	933	’ ‘
292578	292582	292561	292561	You	933	’ returned Arthur . ‘
292589	292590	292561	292561	You	933	’ ‘
292598	292602	292561	292561	You	933	’ retorted Pancks , ‘
292650	292700	292702	292702	Pancks	396	’re always doing it . When I say you , I mean such men as you . You know you are . Why , I see it every day of my life . I see nothing else . It ’s my business to see it . Therefore I say , ’
292704	292710	292649	292649	you	933	‘ Go in and win ! ’
292711	292720	292722	292722	Arthur	304	‘ But what of Go in and lose ? ’
292724	292732	292734	292734	Pancks	396	‘ Ca n’t be done , sir , ’
292736	292767	292734	292734	Pancks	396	‘ I have looked into it . Name up everywhere -- immense resources -- enormous capital -- great position -- high connection -- government influence . Ca n’t be done ! ’
292950	292955	292956	292956	He	304	‘ looked into it . ’
293402	293409	293378	293381	great numbers of Britons	7438	‘ ought to take it up ; ’
294179	294191	294173	294173	she	342	‘ Dear Fanny , what is the matter ? Tell me . ’
294192	294199	294201	294201	Fanny	342	‘ Matter , you little Mole , ’
294203	294248	294201	294201	Fanny	342	‘ If you were not the blindest of the blind , you would have no occasion to ask me . The idea of daring to pretend to assert that you have eyes in your head , and yet ask me what ’s the matter ! ’
294249	294257	294173	294173	she	342	‘ Is it Mr Sparkler , dear ? ’
294258	294266	294268	294268	Fanny	342	‘ Mis - ter Spark - ler ! ’
294293	294303	294307	294307	she	342	‘ No , Miss Bat , it is not . ’
294336	294351	294321	294321	she	342	‘ I do n’t think you are well to - night , dear Fanny . ’
294352	294357	294359	294361	the young lady	1678	‘ Stuff and nonsense ! ’
294367	294390	294359	294361	the young lady	1678	‘ I am as well as you are . Perhaps I might say better , and yet make no boast of it . ’
294623	294627	294599	294599	she	342	‘ Amy , you ’re
294631	294632	294599	294599	she	342	’ ‘
294643	294656	294635	294635	I	0	’ said Fanny , when her sister ’s gentleness had calmed her , ‘
294695	294710	294757	294757	you	1027	’ As the announcement was vague , though very peremptory , Little Dorrit returned , ‘
294717	294718	294757	294757	you	1027	’ ‘
294725	294735	294757	294757	you	1027	’ assented Fanny , as she dried her eyes . ‘
294765	294777	294778	294778	I	0	’ Even Amy smiled at this notion , but she said , ‘
294789	294790	294781	294781	Fanny	342	’ ‘
294797	294804	294795	294795	Amy	349	’ returned Fanny , kissing her . ‘
294810	294870	294805	294805	You	1027	’ Having embraced her Anchor with great affection , Fanny took a bottle of sweet toilette water from the table , and called to her maid for a fine handkerchief . She then dismissed that attendant for the night , and went on to be advised ; dabbing her eyes and forehead from time to time to cool them . ‘
294874	294878	294805	294805	You	1027	’ Fanny began , ‘
294952	294953	294950	294950	Amy	349	’ ‘
294961	294967	294950	294950	Amy	349	’ said Amy , mildly , ‘
294974	294975	294950	294950	Amy	349	’ ‘
294998	294999	295000	295000	I	0	’ ‘
295006	295015	294982	294982	I	0	’ Little Dorrit interposed in her zealous admiration , ‘
295025	295026	295016	295017	no one	1347	’ ‘
295036	295040	295016	295017	no one	1347	’ said Fanny , ‘
295060	295076	295016	295017	no one	1347	’ Here she dabbed her sister ’s forehead , and blew upon it a little . ‘
295081	295085	295078	295078	you	11646	’ resumed Fanny , ‘
295268	295269	295270	295271	Poor Edward	649	’ ‘
295273	295287	295270	295271	Poor Edward	649	’ sighed Little Dorrit , with the whole family history in the sigh . ‘
295298	295305	295292	295292	you	11570	’ returned Fanny , rather sharply . ‘
295382	295383	295389	295389	Fanny--	462	’ ‘
295390	295395	295389	295389	Fanny--	462	’ Fanny stopped her . ‘
295408	295412	295406	295406	Amy	349	’ said she , ‘
295418	295441	295406	295406	Amy	349	’ Feeling that she had been sharp again , she dabbed her sister ’s forehead again , and blew upon it again . ‘
295498	295499	295485	295485	my	0	’ ‘
295502	295509	295510	295510	I	0	’ asked her sister , anxiously . ‘
295514	295523	295527	295527	mother	953	’ said Fanny , without answering the question , ‘
295557	295603	295554	295555	Mrs Merdle	464	’ Little Dorrit laid her hand upon the hand that held the bottle of sweet water , with a still more anxious look . Fanny , quite punishing her own forehead with the vehement dabs she now began to give it , fitfully went on . ‘
295683	295684	295672	295672	I	0	’ ‘
295691	295713	295672	295672	I	0	’ expostulated Little Dorrit , upon whom a kind of terror had been stealing as she perceived what her sister meant . ‘
295759	295774	295758	295758	Fanny--	462	’ Fanny had stopped the dabbing hand , and was looking at her fixedly . ‘
295779	295783	295758	295758	Fanny--	462	’ cried Fanny . ‘
295830	295837	295820	295820	you	342	’ dabbing her sister ’s forehead ; ‘
295870	295871	295868	295868	myself	0	’ ‘
295904	295905	295909	295909	you	342	’ ‘
295915	295919	295909	295909	you	342	’ retorted Fanny . ‘
295982	295983	295959	295959	I	0	’ ‘
295989	295990	295959	295959	I	0	’ ‘
296002	296023	296024	296024	You	342	’ answered Fanny , with indifference . Then , suddenly changing her indifference into a burning restlessness , she added , ‘
296067	296068	296071	296071	Fanny	342	’ ‘
296077	296078	296071	296071	Fanny	342	’ ‘
296085	296089	296071	296071	Fanny	342	’ interrupted Fanny . ‘
296152	296153	296154	296154	Fanny	342	’ ‘
296179	296180	296181	296181	Amy	349	’ ‘
296187	296195	296181	296181	Amy	349	’ retorted Fanny , parodying her words , ‘
296224	296225	296227	296227	you	342	’ ‘
296241	296242	296227	296227	you	342	’ ‘
296247	296256	296227	296227	you	342	’ said Fanny , with a triumphant smile . ‘
296344	296371	296334	296334	I	0	’ Fanny set down the bottle when she came to this , and walked about the room ; always stopping and standing still while she spoke . ‘
296392	296400	296401	296401	I	0	’ This was followed by another walk . ‘
296520	296521	296516	296516	I	0	’ ‘
296537	296538	296527	296527	you	7536	’ ‘
296586	296623	296624	296624	Figure	650	’ There was something of a desolate tone in those words ; but , with a short proud laugh she took another walk , and after passing a great looking - glass came to another stop . ‘
296704	296753	296695	296695	we	7539	’ Something in the thought that was agreeable and flattering , brought her back to her seat in a gayer temper . She took her sister ’s hands in hers , and clapped all four hands above her head as she looked in her sister ’s face laughing : ‘
296824	296852	296818	296818	Amy	349	’ Meeting an earnest and imploring look in Amy ’s face , she brought the four hands down , and laid only one on Amy ’s lips . ‘
296863	296871	296818	296818	Amy	349	’ she said in a sterner way , ‘
296927	297230	296917	296917	You	1881	’ With those words Fanny weighed her Anchor , and -- having taken so much advice -- left off being advised for that occasion . Thenceforward , Amy observed Mr Sparkler ’s treatment by his enslaver , with new reasons for attaching importance to all that passed between them . There were times when Fanny appeared quite unable to endure his mental feebleness , and when she became so sharply impatient of it that she would all but dismiss him for good . There were other times when she got on much better with him ; when he amused her , and when her sense of superiority seemed to counterbalance that opposite side of the scale . If Mr Sparkler had been other than the faithfullest and most submissive of swains , he was sufficiently hard pressed to have fled from the scene of his trials , and have set at least the whole distance from Rome to London between himself and his enchantress . But he had no greater will of his own than a boat has when it is towed by a steam - ship ; and he followed his cruel mistress through rough and smooth , on equally strong compulsion . Mrs Merdle , during these passages , said little to Fanny , but said more about her . She was , as it were , forced to look at her through her eye - glass , and in general conversation to allow commendations of her beauty to be wrung from her by its irresistible demands . The defiant character it assumed when Fanny heard these extollings ( as it generally happened that she did ) , was not expressive of concessions to the impartial bosom ; but the utmost revenge the bosom took was , to say audibly , ‘
297246	297657	297660	297660	Amy	349	’ It might have been about a month or six weeks after the night of the new advice , when Little Dorrit began to think she detected some new understanding between Mr Sparkler and Fanny . Mr Sparkler , as if in attendance to some compact , scarcely ever spoke without first looking towards Fanny for leave . That young lady was too discreet ever to look back again ; but , if Mr Sparkler had permission to speak , she remained silent ; if he had not , she herself spoke . Moreover , it became plain whenever Henry Gowan attempted to perform the friendly office of drawing him out , that he was not to be drawn . And not only that , but Fanny would presently , without any pointed application in the world , chance to say something with such a sting in it that Gowan would draw back as if he had put his hand into a bee - hive . There was yet another circumstance which went a long way to confirm Little Dorrit in her fears , though it was not a great circumstance in itself . Mr Sparkler ’s demeanour towards herself changed . It became fraternal . Sometimes , when she was in the outer circle of assemblies -- at their own residence , at Mrs Merdle ’s , or elsewhere -- she would find herself stealthily supported round the waist by Mr Sparkler ’s arm . Mr Sparkler never offered the slightest explanation of this attention ; but merely smiled with an air of blundering , contented , good - natured proprietorship , which , in so heavy a gentleman , was ominously expressive . Little Dorrit was at home one day , thinking about Fanny with a heavy heart . They had a room at one end of their drawing - room suite , nearly all irregular bay - window , projecting over the street , and commanding all the picturesque life and variety of the Corso , both up and down . At three or four o’clock in the afternoon , English time , the view from this window was very bright and peculiar ; and Little Dorrit used to sit and muse here , much as she had been used to while away the time in her balcony at Venice . Seated thus one day , she was softly touched on the shoulder , and Fanny said , ‘
297663	297761	297660	297660	Amy	349	’ and took her seat at her side . Their seat was a part of the window ; when there was anything in the way of a procession going on , they used to have bright draperies hung out of the window , and used to kneel or sit on this seat , and look out at it , leaning on the brilliant colour . But there was no procession that day , and Little Dorrit was rather surprised by Fanny ’s being at home at that hour , as she was generally out on horseback then . ‘
297766	297770	297764	297764	Amy	349	’ said Fanny , ‘
297780	297781	297782	297782	I	0	’ ‘
297790	297791	297788	297788	Fanny	342	’ ‘
297822	297888	297818	297818	you	349	’ Amy _ had _ been thinking of this some one else too ; for it was Mr Sparkler . She did not say so , however , as she gave him her hand . Mr Sparkler came and sat down on the other side of her , and she felt the fraternal railing come behind her , and apparently stretch on to include Fanny . ‘
297895	297902	297818	297818	you	349	’ said Fanny with a sigh , ‘
297911	297912	297905	297905	you	7551	’ ‘
297923	297937	297905	297905	you	7551	’ stammered Mr Sparkler--‘and there ’s no nonsense about her -- it ’s arranged-- ’
297938	297946	297948	297948	Fanny	342	‘ You need n’t explain , Edmund , ’
297950	297956	297958	297959	Mr Sparkler	472	‘ No , my love , ’
297961	297967	297969	297969	Fanny	342	‘ In short , pet , ’
297971	298013	297969	297969	Fanny	342	‘ on the whole , we are engaged . We must tell papa about it either to - night or to - morrow , according to the opportunities . Then it ’s done , and very little more need be said . ’
298014	298019	298021	298022	Mr Sparkler	472	‘ My dear Fanny , ’
298027	298038	298021	298022	Mr Sparkler	472	‘ I should like to say a word to Amy . ’
298039	298048	297969	297969	Fanny	342	‘ Well , well ! Say it for goodness ’
298051	298057	298021	298022	Mr Sparkler	472	’ returned the young lady . ‘
298066	298071	298021	298022	Mr Sparkler	472	’ said Mr Sparkler , ‘
298095	298096	298097	298097	We	7556	’ ‘
298105	298110	298103	298103	Edmund	557	’ interposed Miss Fanny . ‘
298129	298130	298133	298134	my love	11570	’ ‘
298136	298141	298133	298134	my love	11570	’ said Mr Sparkler . ‘
298183	298184	298187	298187	Edmund	557	’ ‘
298191	298207	298187	298187	Edmund	557	’ interrupted Fanny , with a slight pat of her pretty foot upon the floor . ‘
298212	298216	298218	298219	Mr Sparkler	472	’re quite right , ’
298221	298286	298288	298289	Mr Sparkler	472	‘ and I know I have a habit of it . What I wished to declare was , that nothing can be a greater happiness to myself , myself - next to the happiness of being united to pre - eminently the most glorious of girls -- than to have the happiness of cultivating the affectionate acquaintance of Amy . I may not myself , ’
298292	298341	298288	298289	Mr Sparkler	472	‘ be up to the mark on some other subjects at a short notice , and I am aware that if you were to poll Society the general opinion would be that I am not ; but on the subject of Amy I AM up to the mark ! ’
298351	298360	298362	298363	Mr Sparkler	472	‘ A knife and fork and an apartment , ’
298377	298411	298413	298414	Mr Sparkler	472	‘ will ever be at Amy ’s disposal . My Governor , I am sure , will always be proud to entertain one whom I so much esteem . And regarding my mother , ’
298416	298425	298413	298414	Mr Sparkler	472	‘ who is a remarkably fine woman , with-- ’
298426	298431	298433	298434	Miss Fanny	342	‘ Edmund , Edmund ! ’
298439	298446	298448	298449	Mr Sparkler	472	‘ With submission , my soul , ’
298451	298502	298448	298449	Mr Sparkler	472	‘ I know I have a habit of it , and I thank you very much , my adorable girl , for taking the trouble to correct it ; but my mother is admitted on all sides to be a remarkably fine woman , and she really has n’t any . ’
298503	298513	298515	298515	Fanny	342	‘ That may be , or may not be , ’
298517	298527	298515	298515	Fanny	342	‘ but pray do n’t mention it any more . ’
298528	298536	298538	298539	Mr Sparkler	472	‘ I will not , my love , ’
298541	298559	298561	298561	Fanny	342	‘ Then , in fact , you have nothing more to say , Edmund ; have you ? ’
298563	298573	298575	298576	Mr Sparkler	472	‘ So far from it , my adorable girl , ’
298578	298587	298575	298576	Mr Sparkler	472	‘ I apologise for having said so much . ’
298666	298672	298663	298663	she	349	‘ O Fanny , Fanny ! ’
299470	299480	299482	299483	Mr Dorrit	578	‘ Have I the honour to conclude , madam , ’
299485	299506	299482	299483	Mr Dorrit	578	‘ that the direction which Mr Sparkler ’s affections have taken , is -- ha - approved of by you ? ’
299507	299515	299517	299518	the lady	3830	‘ I assure you , Mr Dorrit , ’
299520	299529	299517	299518	the lady	3830	‘ that , personally , I am charmed . ’
299538	299541	299543	299544	Mrs Merdle	464	‘ Personally , ’
299546	299549	299543	299544	Mrs Merdle	464	‘ charmed . ’
299556	299559	299561	299562	Mr Dorrit	578	‘ personally , ’
299580	299585	299587	299588	Mrs Merdle	464	‘ I can not , ’
299590	299644	299646	299646	she	464	‘ take upon myself to answer positively for Mr Merdle ; gentlemen , especially gentlemen who are what Society calls capitalists , having their own ideas of these matters . But I should think -- merely giving an opinion , Mr Dorrit -- I should think Mr Merdle would be upon the whole , ’
299658	299662	299646	299646	she	464	‘ quite charmed . ’
299704	299833	299835	299836	Mrs Merdle	464	‘ Though , indeed , Mr Dorrit , it is scarcely necessary for me to make that remark , except in the mere openness of saying what is uppermost to one whom I so highly regard , and with whom I hope I may have the pleasure of being brought into still more agreeable relations . For one can not but see the great probability of your considering such things from Mr Merdle ’s own point of view , except indeed that circumstances have made it Mr Merdle ’s accidental fortune , or misfortune , to be engaged in business transactions , and that they , however vast , may a little cramp his horizons . I am a very child as to having any notion of business , ’
299838	299853	299835	299836	Mrs Merdle	464	‘ but I am afraid , Mr Dorrit , it may have that tendency . ’
299976	299982	299984	299985	Mrs Merdle	464	‘ You are generosity itself , ’
299994	300013	299990	299990	her	464	‘ let us hope so . But I confess I am almost superstitious in my ideas about business . ’
300092	300098	300099	300099	she	464	‘ I say so much , ’
300103	300163	300099	300099	she	464	‘ merely because Mr Merdle has always taken the greatest interest in Edmund , and has always expressed the strongest desire to advance his prospects . Edmund ’s public position , I think you know . His private position rests solely with Mr Merdle . In my foolish incapacity for business , I assure you I know no more . ’
300482	300499	300501	300502	Mr Dorrit	578	‘ The preliminaries being so satisfactorily arranged , I think I will now , my dear , ’
300504	300514	300501	300502	Mr Dorrit	578	‘ announce -- ha -- formally , to Mrs General-- ’
300515	300518	300520	300520	Fanny	342	‘ Papa , ’
300530	300545	300520	300520	Fanny	342	‘ I do n’t see what Mrs General has got to do with it . ’
300546	300550	300552	300553	Mr Dorrit	578	‘ My dear , ’
300555	300574	300552	300553	Mr Dorrit	578	‘ it will be an act of courtesy to -- hum -- a lady , well bred and refined-- ’
300575	300592	300594	300594	Fanny	342	‘ Oh ! I am sick of Mrs General ’s good breeding and refinement , papa , ’
300596	300604	300594	300594	Fanny	342	‘ I am tired of Mrs General . ’
300605	300608	300610	300611	Mr Dorrit	578	‘ Tired , ’
300616	300624	300610	300611	Mr Dorrit	578	‘ of -- ha -- Mrs General . ’
300625	300633	300635	300635	Fanny	342	‘ Quite disgusted with her , papa , ’
300637	300666	300635	300635	Fanny	342	‘ I really do n’t see what she has to do with my marriage . Let her keep to her own matrimonial projects -- if she has any . ’
300667	300670	300672	300673	Mr Dorrit	578	‘ Fanny , ’
300692	300709	300635	300635	Fanny	342	‘ I beg the favour of your explaining -- ha -- what it is you mean . ’
300710	300716	300718	300718	Fanny	342	‘ I mean , papa , ’
300720	300777	300718	300718	Fanny	342	‘ that if Mrs General should happen to have any matrimonial projects of her own , I dare say they are quite enough to occupy her spare time . And that if she has not , so much the better ; but still I do n’t wish to have the honour of making announcements to her . ’
300778	300787	300789	300790	Mr Dorrit	578	‘ Permit me to ask you , Fanny , ’
300792	300796	300789	300790	Mr Dorrit	578	‘ why not ? ’
300797	300810	300812	300812	Fanny	342	‘ Because she can find my engagement out for herself , papa , ’
300814	300890	300812	300812	Fanny	342	‘ She is watchful enough , I dare say . I think I have seen her so . Let her find it out for herself . If she should not find it out for herself , she will know it when I am married . And I hope you will not consider me wanting in affection for you , papa , if I say it strikes me that will be quite enough for Mrs General . ’
300891	300894	300896	300897	Mr Dorrit	578	‘ Fanny , ’
300899	300926	300896	300897	Mr Dorrit	578	‘ I am amazed , I am displeased by this -- hum -- this capricious and unintelligible display of animosity towards -- ha -- Mrs General . ’
300927	300937	300939	300939	Fanny	342	‘ Do not , if you please , papa , ’
300941	300960	300939	300939	Fanny	342	‘ call it animosity , because I assure you I do not consider Mrs General worth my animosity . ’
301012	301053	300988	300989	His daughter	859	‘ Very well , papa . I am truly sorry if you do n’t like it ; but I ca n’t help it . I am not a child , and I am not Amy , and I must speak . ’
301054	301057	301059	301060	Mr Dorrit	578	‘ Fanny , ’
301067	301130	301059	301060	Mr Dorrit	578	‘ if I request you to remain here , while I formally announce to Mrs General , as an exemplary lady , who is -- hum -- a trusted member of this family , the -- ha -- the change that is contemplated among us ; if I -- ha -- not only request it , but -- hum -- insist upon it-- ’
301131	301136	301137	301137	Fanny	342	‘ Oh , papa , ’
301144	301189	301137	301137	Fanny	342	‘ if you make so much of it as that , I have in duty nothing to do but comply . I hope I may have my thoughts upon the subject , however , for I really can not help it under the circumstances . ’
301233	301237	301227	301228	Mr Tinkler	586	‘ Mrs General . ’
301277	301289	301256	301257	Mr Dorrit	578	‘ How dare you , sir ? What do you mean ? ’
301290	301298	301300	301301	Mr Tinkler	586	‘ I beg your pardon , sir , ’
301303	301309	301300	301301	Mr Tinkler	586	‘ I was wishful to know-- ’
301310	301319	301321	301322	Mr Dorrit	578	‘ You wished to know nothing , sir , ’
301327	301349	301321	301322	Mr Dorrit	578	‘ Do n’t tell me you did . Ha . You did n’t . You are guilty of mockery , sir . ’
301350	301356	301357	301358	Mr Tinkler	586	‘ I assure you , sir-- ’
301361	301367	301369	301370	Mr Dorrit	578	‘ Do n’t assure me ! ’
301372	301408	301369	301370	Mr Dorrit	578	‘ I will not be assured by a domestic . You are guilty of mockery . You shall leave me -- hum -- the whole establishment shall leave me . What are you waiting for ? ’
301409	301417	301321	301322	Mr Dorrit	578	‘ Only for my orders , sir . ’
301418	301423	301425	301426	Mr Dorrit	578	‘ It ’s false , ’
301428	301469	301425	301426	Mr Dorrit	578	‘ you have your orders . Ha -- hum . My compliments to Mrs General , and I beg the favour of her coming to me , if quite convenient , for a few minutes . Those are your orders . ’
301537	301541	301543	301544	Mr Dorrit	578	‘ Mrs General , ’
301546	301551	301543	301544	Mr Dorrit	578	‘ take a chair . ’
301571	301574	301576	301577	that gentleman	2147	‘ Madam , ’
301579	301615	301576	301577	that gentleman	2147	‘ as you have had the kindness to undertake the -- hum -- formation of my daughters , and as I am persuaded that nothing nearly affecting them can -- ha -- be indifferent to you-- ’
301616	301620	301622	301623	Mrs General	573	‘ Wholly impossible , ’
301630	301646	301622	301623	Mrs General	573	‘ --I therefore wish to announce to you , madam , that my daughter now present-- ’
301678	301720	301721	301722	Mr Dorrit	578	‘ --That my daughter Fanny is -- ha -- contracted to be married to Mr Sparkler , with whom you are acquainted . Hence , madam , you will be relieved of half your difficult charge -- ha -- difficult charge . ’
301732	301769	301726	301726	his	578	‘ But not , I hope , to the -- hum -- diminution of any other portion , direct or indirect , of the footing you have at present the kindness to occupy in my family . ’
301770	301774	301776	301777	Mrs General	573	‘ Mr Dorrit , ’
301791	301806	301776	301777	Mrs General	573	‘ is ever considerate , and ever but too appreciative of my friendly services . ’
301818	301823	301808	301809	Miss Fanny	342	‘ You are right . ’
301825	301862	301863	301864	Mrs General	573	‘ Miss Dorrit has no doubt exercised the soundest discretion of which the circumstances admitted , and I trust will allow me to offer her my sincere congratulations . When free from the trammels of passion , ’
301884	301925	301866	301866	her	573	‘ when occurring with the approbation of near relatives ; and when cementing the proud structure of a family edifice ; these are usually auspicious events . I trust Miss Dorrit will allow me to offer her my best congratulations . ’
301942	301954	301927	301928	Mrs General	573	‘ Papa , potatoes , poultry , Prunes , and prism . ’
301955	301959	301960	301960	she	573	‘ Mr Dorrit , ’
301964	302027	301960	301960	she	573	‘ is ever most obliging ; and for the attention , and I will add distinction , of having this confidence imparted to me by himself and Miss Dorrit at this early time , I beg to offer the tribute of my thanks . My thanks , and my congratulations , are equally the meed of Mr Dorrit and of Miss Dorrit . ’
302028	302032	302034	302035	Miss Fanny	342	‘ To me , ’
302037	302082	302084	302084	Fanny	342	‘ they are excessively gratifying -- inexpressibly so . The relief of finding that you have no objection to make , Mrs General , quite takes a load off my mind , I am sure . I hardly know what I should have done , ’
302086	302097	302084	302084	Fanny	342	‘ if you had interposed any objection , Mrs General . ’
302123	302132	302134	302134	Fanny	342	‘ To preserve your approbation , Mrs General , ’
302151	302403	302134	302134	Fanny	342	‘ will of course be the highest object of my married life ; to lose it , would of course be perfect wretchedness . I am sure your great kindness will not object , and I hope papa will not object , to my correcting a small mistake you have made , however . The best of us are so liable to mistakes , that even you , Mrs General , have fallen into a little error . The attention and distinction you have so impressively mentioned , Mrs General , as attaching to this confidence , are , I have no doubt , of the most complimentary and gratifying description ; but they do n’t at all proceed from me . The merit of having consulted you on the subject would have been so great in me , that I feel I must not lay claim to it when it really is not mine . It is wholly papa ’s . I am deeply obliged to you for your encouragement and patronage , but it was papa who asked for it . I have to thank you , Mrs General , for relieving my breast of a great weight by so handsomely giving your consent to my engagement , but you have really nothing to thank me for . I hope you will always approve of my proceedings after I have left home and that my sister also may long remain the favoured object of your condescension , Mrs General . ’
302694	302733	302734	302735	Mr Sparkler	472	‘ If I think proper to march among you in triumphal procession attended by this weak captive in bonds , rather than a stronger one , that is my business . Enough that I choose to do it ! ’
302966	302972	302974	302974	she	342	‘ Now , my child , ’
302982	303012	302974	302974	she	342	‘ I am going to tell you something . It is only this moment broached ; and naturally I hurry to you the moment it _ is _ broached . ’
303013	303019	302960	302960	herself	342	‘ Your marriage , Fanny ? ’
303020	303025	303027	303027	Fanny	342	‘ My precious child , ’
303029	303090	303027	303027	Fanny	342	‘ do n’t anticipate me . Let me impart my confidence to you , you flurried little thing , in my own way . As to your guess , if I answered it literally , I should answer no . For really it is not my marriage that is in question , half as much as it is Edmund ’s . ’
303112	303119	303121	303121	Fanny	342	‘ I am in no difficulty , ’
303123	303205	303121	303121	Fanny	342	‘ and in no hurry . I am not wanted at any public office , or to give any vote anywhere else . But Edmund is . And Edmund is deeply dejected at the idea of going away by himself , and , indeed , I do n’t like that he should be trusted by himself . For , if it ’s possible -- and it generally is -- to do a foolish thing , he is sure to do it . ’
303250	303336	303225	303225	she	342	‘ It is far more Edmund ’s question , therefore , than mine . However , we need say no more about that . That is self - evident on the face of it . Well , my dearest Amy ! The point arising , is he to go by himself , or is he not to go by himself , this other point arises , are we to be married here and shortly , or are we to be married at home months hence ? ’
303337	303349	303225	303225	she	342	‘ I see I am going to lose you , Fanny . ’
303350	303358	303360	303360	Fanny	342	‘ What a little thing you are , ’
303368	303385	303386	303386	she	342	‘ for anticipating one ! Pray , my darling , hear me out . That woman , ’
303395	303595	303386	303386	she	342	‘ remains here until after Easter ; so , in the case of my being married here and going to London with Edmund , I should have the start of her . That is something . Further , Amy . That woman being out of the way , I do n’t know that I greatly object to Mr Merdle ’s proposal to Pa that Edmund and I should take up our abode in that house--_you _ know -- where you once went with a dancer , my dear , until our own house can be chosen and fitted up . Further still , Amy . Papa having always intended to go to town himself , in the spring,--you see , if Edmund and I were married here , we might go off to Florence , where papa might join us , and we might all three travel home together . Mr Merdle has entreated Pa to stay with him in that same mansion I have mentioned , and I suppose he will . But he is master of his own actions ; and upon that point ( which is not at all material ) I ca n’t speak positively . ’
303664	303674	303623	303623	her	342	‘ And these are the arrangements , Fanny dear ? ’
303675	303678	303680	303680	Fanny	342	‘ Arrangements ! ’
303682	303728	303680	303680	Fanny	342	‘ Now , really , child , you are a little trying . You know I particularly guarded myself against laying my words open to any such construction . What I said was , that certain questions present themselves ; and these are the questions . ’
303741	303749	303751	303751	Fanny	342	‘ Now , my own sweet girl , ’
303763	303793	303751	303751	Fanny	342	‘ it ’s no use staring . A little owl could stare . I look to you for advice , Amy . What do you advise me to do ? ’
303794	303799	303801	303802	Little Dorrit	274	‘ Do you think , ’
303811	303841	303801	303802	Little Dorrit	274	‘ do you think , Fanny , that if you were to put it off for a few months , it might be , considering all things , best ? ’
303842	303848	303850	303850	Fanny	342	‘ No , little Tortoise , ’
303856	303866	303850	303850	Fanny	342	‘ I do n’t think anything of the kind . ’
303916	303988	303890	303890	she	342	‘ Do n’t suppose I am hasty or unkind , darling , because I really am not . But you are such a little oddity ! You make one bite your head off , when one wants to be soothing beyond everything . Did n’t I tell you , you dearest baby , that Edmund ca n’t be trusted by himself ? And do n’t you know that he ca n’t ? ’
303989	304003	303890	303890	she	342	‘ Yes , yes , Fanny . You said so , I know . ’
304004	304013	304015	304015	Fanny	342	‘ And you know it , I know , ’
304017	304047	304015	304015	Fanny	342	‘ Well , my precious child ! If he is not to be trusted by himself , it follows , I suppose , that I should go with him ? ’
304048	304056	304058	304059	Little Dorrit	274	‘ It -- seems so , love , ’
304061	304096	304058	304059	Little Dorrit	274	‘ Therefore , having heard the arrangements that are feasible to carry out that object , am I to understand , dearest Amy , that on the whole you advise me to make them ? ’
304097	304105	304107	304108	Little Dorrit	274	‘ It -- seems so , love , ’
304111	304115	304117	304117	Fanny	342	‘ Very well , ’
304124	304164	304117	304117	Fanny	342	‘ then I suppose it must be done ! I came to you , my sweet , the moment I saw the doubt , and the necessity of deciding . I have now decided . So let it be . ’
304217	304224	304225	304225	she	342	‘ After all , my Amy , ’
304231	304259	304225	304225	she	342	‘ you are the best of small creatures , and full of good sense ; and I do n’t know what I shall ever do without you ! ’
304277	304329	304225	304225	she	342	‘ Not that I contemplate doing without You , Amy , by any means , for I hope we shall ever be next to inseparable . And now , my pet , I am going to give you a word of advice . When you are left alone here with Mrs General-- ’
304330	304342	304344	304345	Little Dorrit	274	‘ I am to be left alone here with Mrs General ? ’
304349	304799	304344	304345	Little Dorrit	274	‘ Why , of course , my precious , till papa comes back ! Unless you call Edward company , which he certainly is not , even when he is here , and still more certainly is not when he is away at Naples or in Sicily . I was going to say -- but you are such a beloved little Marplot for putting one out -- when you are left alone here with Mrs General , Amy , do n’t you let her slide into any sort of artful understanding with you that she is looking after Pa , or that Pa is looking after her . She will if she can . I know her sly manner of feeling her way with those gloves of hers . But do n’t you comprehend her on any account . And if Pa should tell you when he comes back , that he has it in contemplation to make Mrs General your mama ( which is not the less likely because I am going away ) , my advice to you is , that you say at once , “ Papa , I beg to object most strongly . Fanny cautioned me about this , and she objected , and I object . ” I do n’t mean to say that any objection from you , Amy , is likely to be of the smallest effect , or that I think you likely to make it with any degree of firmness . But there is a principle involved -- a filial principle -- and I implore you not to submit to be mother - in - lawed by Mrs General , without asserting it in making every one about you as uncomfortable as possible . I do n’t expect you to stand by it -- indeed , I know you wo n’t , Pa being concerned -- but I wish to rouse you to a sense of duty . As to any help from me , or as to any opposition that I can offer to such a match , you shall not be left in the lurch , my love . Whatever weight I may derive from my position as a married girl not wholly devoid of attractions -- used , as that position always shall be , to oppose that woman -- I will bring to bear , you May depend upon it , on the head and false hair ( for I am confident it ’s not all real , ugly as it is and unlikely as it appears that any One in their Senses would go to the expense of buying it ) of Mrs General ! ’
305877	305883	305885	305886	Mr Dorrit	578	‘ Amy , my dear , ’
305894	305914	305885	305886	Mr Dorrit	578	‘ this is the close of a day , that has -- ha -- greatly impressed and gratified me . ’
305915	305925	305885	305886	Mr Dorrit	578	‘ A little tired you , dear , too ? ’
305926	305929	305931	305932	Mr Dorrit	578	‘ No , ’
305934	305961	305931	305932	Mr Dorrit	578	‘ no : I am not sensible of fatigue when it arises from an occasion so -- hum -- replete with gratification of the purest kind . ’

306053	306117	306050	306050	he	578	‘ your dear sister , our Fanny , has contracted ha hum -- a marriage , eminently calculated to extend the basis of our -- ha -- connection , and to -- hum -- consolidate our social relations . My love , I trust that the time is not far distant when some -- ha -- eligible partner may be found for you . ’
306118	306151	306152	306152	She	7703	‘ Oh no ! Let me stay with you . I beg and pray that I may stay with you ! I want nothing but to stay and take care of you ! ’
306161	306168	306170	306171	Mr Dorrit	578	‘ Nay , Amy , Amy , ’
306173	306234	306235	306235	he	578	‘ This is weak and foolish , weak and foolish . You have a -- ha -- responsibility imposed upon you by your position . It is to develop that position , and be -- hum -- worthy of that position . As to taking care of me ; I can -- ha -- take care of myself . Or , ’
306241	306300	306235	306235	he	578	‘ if I should need to be taken care of , I -- hum -- can , with the -- ha -- blessing of Providence , be taken care of , I -- ha hum -- I can not , my dear child , think of engrossing , and -- ha -- as it were , sacrificing you . ’
306346	306429	306235	306235	he	578	‘ Do n’t speak , Amy . I positively say I can not do it . I -- ha -- must not do it . My -- hum -- conscience would not allow it . I therefore , my love , take the opportunity afforded by this gratifying and impressive occasion of -- ha -- solemnly remarking , that it is now a cherished wish and purpose of mine to see you -- ha -- eligibly ( I repeat eligibly ) married . ’
306430	306438	306235	306235	he	578	‘ Oh no , dear ! Pray ! ’
306439	306442	306444	306445	Mr Dorrit	578	‘ Amy , ’
306447	306592	306444	306445	Mr Dorrit	578	‘ I am well persuaded that if the topic were referred to any person of superior social knowledge , of superior delicacy and sense -- let us say , for instance , to -- ha -- Mrs General -- that there would not be two opinions as to the -- hum -- affectionate character and propriety of my sentiments . But , as I know your loving and dutiful nature from -- hum -- from experience , I am quite satisfied that it is necessary to say no more . I have -- hum -- no husband to propose at present , my dear : I have not even one in view . I merely wish that we should -- ha -- understand each other . Hum . Good night , my dear and sole remaining daughter . Good night . God bless you ! ’

308418	308442	308415	308416	Mr Merdle	273	‘ is generally considered a very attractive woman . And she is , no doubt . I am sensible of her being so . ’

309352	309392	309329	309330	Mr Merdle	273	‘ As a sort of return for it . I will see , if you please , how I can exert this limited power ( for people are jealous , and it is limited ) , to your advantage . ’

312679	312688	312690	312690	Flora	499	‘ It ’s a very different person indeed , ’

314424	314540	314413	314413	himself	578	‘ I am -- ha -- a gentleman of property , at present residing in Italy with my family , my servants , and -- hum -- my rather large establishment . Being in London for a short time on affairs connected with -- ha -- my estate , and hearing of this strange disappearance , I wished to make myself acquainted with the circumstances at first - hand , because there is -- ha hum -- an English gentleman in Italy whom I shall no doubt see on my return , who has been in habits of close and daily intimacy with Monsieur Blandois . Mr Henry Gowan . You may know the name . ’
314541	314547	314548	314549	Mrs Clennam	313	‘ Never heard of it . ’
314559	314574	314576	314577	Mr Dorrit	578	‘ Wishing to -- ha -- make the narrative coherent and consecutive to him , ’

314590	314597	314413	314413	himself	578	‘ Thirty , if you choose . ’
314598	314606	314413	314413	himself	578	‘ Have you known Monsieur Blandois long ? ’
314607	314640	314641	314642	Mrs Clennam	313	‘ Not a twelvemonth . Mr Flintwinch here , will refer to the books and tell you when , and by whom at Paris he was introduced to us . If that , ’
314645	314660	314641	314642	Mrs Clennam	313	‘ should be any satisfaction to you . It is poor satisfaction to us . ’
314661	314668	314413	314413	himself	578	‘ Have you seen him often ? ’
314669	314678	314641	314642	Mrs Clennam	313	‘ No . Twice . Once before , and-- ’

314688	314693	314685	314686	Mr Flintwinch	320	‘ And that once . ’
314694	314699	314701	314702	Mr Dorrit	578	‘ Pray , madam , ’
314730	314787	314717	314717	he	578	‘ pray , madam , may I inquire , for the greater satisfaction of the gentleman whom I have the honour to -- ha -- retain , or protect or let me say to -- hum -- know -- to know -- Was Monsieur Blandois here on business on the night indicated in this present sheet ? ’
314788	314795	314797	314798	Mrs Clennam	313	‘ On what he called business , ’
314800	314815	314797	314798	Mrs Clennam	313	‘ Is -- ha -- excuse me -- is its nature to be communicated ? ’
314816	314819	314717	314717	he	578	‘ No . ’
314832	314840	314842	314843	Mrs Clennam	313	‘ The question has been asked before , ’
314845	314876	314842	314843	Mrs Clennam	313	‘ and the answer has been , No . We do n’t choose to publish our transactions , however unimportant , to all the town . We say , No . ’
314877	314892	314894	314895	Mr Dorrit	578	‘ I mean , he took away no money with him , for example , ’
314897	314912	314894	314895	Mr Dorrit	578	‘ He took away none of ours , sir , and got none here . ’
314913	314917	314919	314920	Mr Dorrit	578	‘ I suppose , ’
314938	314951	314932	314933	Mr Flintwinch	320	‘ you have no way of accounting to yourself for this mystery ? ’
314952	314959	314961	314962	Mrs Clennam	313	‘ Why do you suppose so ? ’
314985	314993	314994	314994	she	313	‘ I account for it , sir , ’
315006	315021	314994	314994	she	313	‘ by having no doubt that he is travelling somewhere , or hiding somewhere . ’
315022	315035	314994	314994	she	313	‘ Do you know -- ha -- why he should hide anywhere ? ’
315036	315039	314994	314994	she	313	‘ No . ’
315055	315068	315069	315070	Mrs Clennam	313	‘ You asked me if I accounted for the disappearance to myself , ’
315075	315119	315069	315070	Mrs Clennam	313	‘ not if I accounted for it to you . I do not pretend to account for it to you , sir . I understand it to be no more my business to do that , than it is yours to require that . ’
315242	315260	315235	315235	she	312	‘ There ! O good Lord ! there it is again . Hark , Jeremiah ! Now ! ’
315334	315340	315342	315342	he	320	‘ Affery , my woman , ’
315362	315424	315342	315342	he	320	‘ you are at your old tricks . You ’ll be walking in your sleep next , my woman , and playing the whole round of your distempered antics .

315460	315471	315438	315438	Jeremiah	314	‘ Now , sir ; shall I light you down ? ’

318563	320249	320251	320251	you	7978	’ windows . Ultimately , he went into the most famous jeweller ’s , and said he wanted to buy a little gift for a lady . It was a charming little woman to whom he said it -- a sprightly little woman , dressed in perfect taste , who came out of a green velvet bower to attend upon him , from posting up some dainty little books of account which one could hardly suppose to be ruled for the entry of any articles more commercial than kisses , at a dainty little shining desk which looked in itself like a sweetmeat . For example , then , said the little woman , what species of gift did Monsieur desire ? A love - gift ? Mr Dorrit smiled , and said , Eh , well ! Perhaps . What did he know ? It was always possible ; the sex being so charming . Would she show him some ? Most willingly , said the little woman . Flattered and enchanted to show him many . But pardon ! To begin with , he would have the great goodness to observe that there were love - gifts , and there were nuptial gifts . For example , these ravishing ear - rings and this necklace so superb to correspond , were what one called a love - gift . These brooches and these rings , of a beauty so gracious and celestial , were what one called , with the permission of Monsieur , nuptial gifts . Perhaps it would be a good arrangement , Mr Dorrit hinted , smiling , to purchase both , and to present the love - gift first , and to finish with the nuptial offering ? Ah Heaven ! said the little woman , laying the tips of the fingers of her two little hands against each other , that would be generous indeed , that would be a special gallantry ! And without doubt the lady so crushed with gifts would find them irresistible . Mr Dorrit was not sure of that . But , for example , the sprightly little woman was very sure of it , she said . So Mr Dorrit bought a gift of each sort , and paid handsomely for it . As he strolled back to his hotel afterwards , he carried his head high : having plainly got up his castle now to a much loftier altitude than the two square towers of Notre Dame . Building away with all his might , but reserving the plans of his castle exclusively for his own eye , Mr Dorrit posted away for Marseilles . Building on , building on , busily , busily , from morning to night . Falling asleep , and leaving great blocks of building materials dangling in the air ; waking again , to resume work and get them into their places . What time the Courier in the rumble , smoking Young John ’s best cigars , left a little thread of thin light smoke behind -- perhaps as _ he _ built a castle or two with stray pieces of Mr Dorrit ’s money . Not a fortified town that they passed in all their journey was as strong , not a Cathedral summit was as high , as Mr Dorrit ’s castle . Neither the Saone nor the Rhone sped with the swiftness of that peerless building ; nor was the Mediterranean deeper than its foundations ; nor were the distant landscapes on the Cornice road , nor the hills and bay of Genoa the Superb , more beautiful . Mr Dorrit and his matchless castle were disembarked among the dirty white houses and dirtier felons of Civita Vecchia , and thence scrambled on to Rome as they could , through the filth that festered on the way . CHAPTER 19 . The Storming of the Castle in the Air The sun had gone down full four hours , and it was later than most travellers would like it to be for finding themselves outside the walls of Rome , when Mr Dorrit ’s carriage , still on its last wearisome stage , rattled over the solitary Campagna . The savage herdsmen and the fierce - looking peasants who had chequered the way while the light lasted , had all gone down with the sun , and left the wilderness blank . At some turns of the road , a pale flare on the horizon , like an exhalation from the ruin - sown land , showed that the city was yet far off ; but this poor relief was rare and short - lived . The carriage dipped down again into a hollow of the black dry sea , and for a long time there was nothing visible save its petrified swell and the gloomy sky . Mr Dorrit , though he had his castle - building to engage his mind , could not be quite easy in that desolate place . He was far more curious , in every swerve of the carriage , and every cry of the postilions , than he had been since he quitted London . The valet on the box evidently quaked . The Courier in the rumble was not altogether comfortable in his mind . As often as Mr Dorrit let down the glass and looked back at him ( which was very often ) , he saw him smoking John Chivery out , it is true , but still generally standing up the while and looking about him , like a man who had his suspicions , and kept upon his guard . Then would Mr Dorrit , pulling up the glass again , reflect that those postilions were cut - throat looking fellows , and that he would have done better to have slept at Civita Vecchia , and have started betimes in the morning . But , for all this , he worked at his castle in the intervals . And now , fragments of ruinous enclosure , yawning window - gap and crazy wall , deserted houses , leaking wells , broken water - tanks , spectral cypress - trees , patches of tangled vine , and the changing of the track to a long , irregular , disordered lane where everything was crumbling away , from the unsightly buildings to the jolting road -- now , these objects showed that they were nearing Rome . And now , a sudden twist and stoppage of the carriage inspired Mr Dorrit with the mistrust that the brigand moment was come for twisting him into a ditch and robbing him ; until , letting down the glass again and looking out , he perceived himself assailed by nothing worse than a funeral procession , which came mechanically chaunting by , with an indistinct show of dirty vestments , lurid torches , swinging censers , and a great cross borne before a priest . He was an ugly priest by torchlight ; of a lowering aspect , with an overhanging brow ; and as his eyes met those of Mr Dorrit , looking bareheaded out of the carriage , his lips , moving as they chaunted , seemed to threaten that important traveller ; likewise the action of his hand , which was in fact his manner of returning the traveller ’s salutation , seemed to come in aid of that menace . So thought Mr Dorrit , made fanciful by the weariness of building and travelling , as the priest drifted past him , and the procession straggled away , taking its dead along with it . Upon their so - different way went Mr Dorrit ’s company too ; and soon , with their coach load of luxuries from the two great capitals of Europe , they were ( like the Goths reversed ) beating at the gates of Rome . Mr Dorrit was not expected by his own people that night . He had been ; but they had given him up until to - morrow , not doubting that it was later than he would care , in those parts , to be out . Thus , when his equipage stopped at his own gate , no one but the porter appeared to receive him . Was Miss Dorrit from home ? he asked . No . She was within . Good , said Mr Dorrit to the assembling servants ; let them keep where they were ; let them help to unload the carriage ; he would find Miss Dorrit for himself . So he went up his grand staircase , slowly , and tired , and looked into various chambers which were empty , until he saw a light in a small ante - room . It was a curtained nook , like a tent , within two other rooms ; and it looked warm and bright in colour , as he approached it through the dark avenue they made . There was a draped doorway , but no door ; and as he stopped here , looking in unseen , he felt a pang . Surely not like jealousy ? For why like jealousy ? There was only his daughter and his brother there : he , with his chair drawn to the hearth , enjoying the warmth of the evening wood fire ; she seated at a little table , busied with some embroidery work . Allowing for the great difference in the still - life of the picture , the figures were much the same as of old ; his brother being sufficiently like himself to represent himself , for a moment , in the composition . So had he sat many a night , over a coal fire far away ; so had she sat , devoted to him . Yet surely there was nothing to be jealous of in the old miserable poverty . Whence , then , the pang in his heart ? ‘

320437	320500	320411	320411	uncle	10345	’ She paused for an instant in her work to look at him , and her look revived that former pain in her father ’s breast ; in his poor weak breast , so full of contradictions , vacillations , inconsistencies , the little peevish perplexities of this ignorant life , mists which the morning without a night only can clear away . ‘
320514	320520	320501	320501	I	0	’ said the old man , ‘
320618	320625	320616	320616	William	524	’ said the old man admiringly , ‘

320755	320759	320753	320753	Amy	349	’ he said . ‘

320863	320878	320854	320854	I	0	’ returned his brother with an elaboration of fraternity in which there was severity ; ‘
320896	320897	320893	320893	I	0	’ ‘
320902	320916	320919	320919	William	347	’ returned the other , with a misgiving that he had given offence . ‘

320928	320943	320926	320926	Amy	349	’ pursued Mr Dorrit , as she helped him to put off his wrappers . ‘
320986	320987	320988	320989	Dear father	11527	’ ‘
321001	321002	320988	320989	Dear father	11527	’ ‘
321009	321021	321004	321004	you	347	’ said Mr Dorrit , with a reproachful frost upon him ; ‘

321070	321107	321063	321063	she	5837	’ Perhaps Mr Dorrit thought that Mrs General had done well in being overcome by the disappointment of his not arriving . At any rate , his face relaxed , and he said with obvious satisfaction , ‘
321119	321189	321113	321114	Mrs General	573	’ During this short dialogue , his daughter had been observant of him , with something more than her usual interest . It would seem as though he had a changed or worn appearance in her eyes , and he perceived and resented it ; for he said with renewed peevishness , when he had divested himself of his travelling - cloak , and had come to the fire : ‘
321225	321226	321227	321227	I	0	’ ‘
321253	321254	321275	321275	you	349	’ ‘

321347	321406	321407	321407	Frederick	353	’ He was so inclined to be angry that she said nothing more in her justification , but remained quietly beside him embracing his arm . As he stood thus , with his brother on the other side , he fell into a heavy doze , of not a minute ’s duration , and awoke with a start . ‘
321409	321418	321407	321407	Frederick	353	’ he said , turning to his brother : ‘
321428	321429	321419	321419	I	0	’ ‘
321442	321443	321444	321444	Frederick	353	’ ‘
321446	321450	321444	321444	Frederick	353	’ he retorted , ‘

321493	321508	321484	321484	You	353	’ said the old man , who had no wish but to please him . ‘

321527	321543	321525	321525	Frederick	353	’ returned Mr Dorrit , with an astonishing superiority to his brother ’s failing powers , ‘
321603	321604	321591	321591	You	353	’ ‘
321611	321615	321591	321591	You	353	’ asked Frederick . ‘

321662	321707	321708	321708	Your	8009	’ After dismissing his brother in this gracious way , he fell into a doze again before the old man was well out of the room : and he would have stumbled forward upon the logs , but for his daughter ’s restraining hold . ‘
321716	321726	321714	321714	Amy	349	’ he said , when he was thus roused . ‘
321767	321768	321771	321771	father	1100	’ ‘

321803	321808	321790	321790	I	0	’ said Mr Dorrit . ‘
321839	322430	322431	322431	She	8014	’ His supper , which was brought to him there , and spread upon the little table where he had seen her working , diverted his attention . She sat at his side as in the days that were gone , for the first time since those days ended . They were alone , and she helped him to his meat and poured out his drink for him , as she had been used to do in the prison . All this happened now , for the first time since their accession to wealth . She was afraid to look at him much , after the offence he had taken ; but she noticed two occasions in the course of his meal , when he all of a sudden looked at her , and looked about him , as if the association were so strong that he needed assurance from his sense of sight that they were not in the old prison - room . Both times , he put his hand to his head as if he missed his old black cap -- though it had been ignominiously given away in the Marshalsea , and had never got free to that hour , but still hovered about the yards on the head of his successor . He took very little supper , but was a long time over it , and often reverted to his brother ’s declining state . Though he expressed the greatest pity for him , he was almost bitter upon him . He said that poor Frederick -- ha hum -- drivelled . There was no other word to express it ; drivelled . Poor fellow ! It was melancholy to reflect what Amy must have undergone from the excessive tediousness of his Society -- wandering and babbling on , poor dear estimable creature , wandering and babbling on -- if it had not been for the relief she had had in Mrs General . Extremely sorry , he then repeated with his former satisfaction , that that -- ha -- superior woman was poorly . Little Dorrit , in her watchful love , would have remembered the lightest thing he said or did that night , though she had had no subsequent reason to recall that night . She always remembered that , when he looked about him under the strong influence of the old association , he tried to keep it out of her mind , and perhaps out of his own too , by immediately expatiating on the great riches and great company that had encompassed him in his absence , and on the lofty position he and his family had to sustain . Nor did she fail to recall that there were two under - currents , side by side , pervading all his discourse and all his manner ; one showing her how well he had got on without her , and how independent he was of her ; the other , in a fitful and unintelligible way almost complaining of her , as if it had been possible that she had neglected him while he was away . His telling her of the glorious state that Mr Merdle kept , and of the court that bowed before him , naturally brought him to Mrs Merdle . So naturally indeed , that although there was an unusual want of sequence in the greater part of his remarks , he passed to her at once , and asked how she was . ‘
322443	322444	322436	322436	She	8014	’ ‘
322447	322452	322436	322436	She	8014	’ asked Mr Dorrit . ‘
322457	322463	322681	322681	He	8016	’ stay upon the road . ’
322464	322473	322475	322476	Mr Dorrit	353	‘ She will be a vast loss here , ’
322478	322506	322475	322476	Mr Dorrit	353	‘ A vast -- ha -- acquisition at home . To Fanny , and to -- hum -- the rest of the -- ha -- great world . ’
322525	322569	322507	322508	Little Dorrit	274	‘ Mrs Merdle is going to have a great farewell Assembly , dear , and a dinner before it . She has been expressing her anxiety that you should return in time . She has invited both you and me to her dinner . ’
322570	322584	322475	322476	Mr Dorrit	353	‘ She is -- ha -- very kind . When is the day ? ’
322585	322593	322475	322476	Mr Dorrit	353	‘ The day after to - morrow . ’

322658	322680	322681	322681	He	8016	‘ You may not , Amy . I want no help . I am your father , not your infirm uncle ! ’
322698	322728	322688	322688	he	8016	‘ You have not kissed me , Amy . Good night , my dear ! We must marry -- ha -- we must marry _ you _ , now . ’

323327	323330	323332	323333	Mr Dorrit	353	‘ Surrounded , ’
323335	323368	323332	323333	Mr Dorrit	353	‘ by -- ha -- all that can charm the taste , and -- hum -- elevate the mind . Happy , my dear madam , in a -- hum -- husband . ’
323399	323402	323403	323404	Mr Dorrit	353	‘ Fanny , ’
323407	323450	323403	323404	Mr Dorrit	353	‘ Fanny , Mrs General , has high qualities . Ha . Ambition -- hum -- purpose , consciousness of -- ha -- position , determination to support that position -- ha , hum -- grace , beauty , and native nobility . ’
323451	323455	323457	323458	Mrs General	573	‘ No doubt , ’
323467	323475	323477	323478	Mr Dorrit	353	‘ Combined with these qualities , madam , ’
323480	323541	323477	323478	Mr Dorrit	353	‘ Fanny has -- ha -- manifested one blemish which has made me -- hum -- made me uneasy , and -- ha -- I must add , angry ; but which I trust may now be considered at an end , even as to herself , and which is undoubtedly at an end as to -- ha -- others . ’
323542	323549	323551	323552	Mrs General	573	‘ To what , Mr Dorrit , ’
323561	323572	323551	323552	Mrs General	573	‘ can you allude ? I am at a loss to-- ’
323573	323583	323585	323586	Mr Dorrit	353	‘ Do not say that , my dear madam , ’
323602	323609	323588	323589	Mrs General	5837	‘ at a loss to imagine . ’
323633	323698	323627	323627	he	353	‘ I refer , Mrs General , to that -- ha -- strong spirit of opposition , or -- hum -- I might say -- ha -- jealousy in Fanny , which has occasionally risen against the -- ha -- sense I entertain of -- hum -- the claims of -- ha -- the lady with whom I have now the honour of communing . ’
323699	323703	323705	323706	Mrs General	573	‘ Mr Dorrit , ’
323708	323762	323705	323706	Mrs General	573	‘ is ever but too obliging , ever but too appreciative . If there have been moments when I have imagined that Miss Dorrit has indeed resented the favourable opinion Mr Dorrit has formed of my services , I have found , in that only too high opinion , my consolation and recompense . ’
323763	323771	323773	323774	Mr Dorrit	353	‘ Opinion of your services , madam ? ’
323776	323779	323780	323781	Mrs General	573	‘ Of , ’
323790	323794	323780	323781	Mrs General	573	‘ my services . ’
323795	323804	323806	323807	Mr Dorrit	353	‘ Of your services alone , dear madam ? ’
323809	323813	323815	323816	Mrs General	573	‘ I presume , ’
323824	323836	323838	323839	Mrs General	573	‘ of my services alone . For , to what else , ’
323850	323854	323838	323839	Mrs General	573	‘ could I impute-- ’
323855	323875	323877	323878	Mr Dorrit	353	‘ To -- ha -- yourself , Mrs General . Ha , hum . To yourself and your merits , ’
323882	323889	323891	323892	Mrs General	573	‘ Mr Dorrit will pardon me , ’
323894	323985	323891	323892	Mrs General	573	‘ if I remark that this is not a time or place for the pursuit of the present conversation . Mr Dorrit will excuse me if I remind him that Miss Dorrit is in the adjoining room , and is visible to myself while I utter her name . Mr Dorrit will forgive me if I observe that I am agitated , and that I find there are moments when weaknesses I supposed myself to have subdued , return with redoubled power . Mr Dorrit will allow me to withdraw . ’
323986	324000	324002	324003	Mr Dorrit	353	‘ Hum . Perhaps we may resume this -- ha -- interesting conversation , ’
324005	324035	324002	324003	Mr Dorrit	353	‘ at another time ; unless it should be , what I hope it is not -- hum -- in any way disagreeable to -- ah -- Mrs General . ’

324056	324065	324047	324047	her	573	‘ must ever claim my homage and obedience . ’

324764	324828	324743	324743	he	353	‘ Amy , Amy . I do n’t feel quite myself . Ha . I do n’t know what ’s the matter with me . I particularly wish to see Bob . Ha . Of all the turnkeys , he ’s as much my friend as yours . See if Bob is in the lodge , and beg him to come to me . ’
324841	324857	324838	324838	everybody	1574	‘ Dear father , I am not there ; I am here , by you . ’
324858	324900	324901	324901	She	8052	‘ Oh ! You are here , Amy ! Good . Hum . Good . Ha . Call Bob . If he has been relieved , and is not on the lock , tell Mrs Bangham to go and fetch him . ’
324919	324926	324927	324927	he	8053	‘ I tell you , child , ’
324931	324966	324927	324927	he	8053	‘ I ca n’t be got up the narrow stairs without Bob . Ha . Send for Bob . Hum . Send for Bob -- best of all the turnkeys -- send for Bob ! ’

In return for which -- hot water -- general kitchen -- and little domestic advantages . Those who are habituated to the -- ha -- Marshalsea , are pleased to call me its father .

325285	325289	325290	325290	he	8056	‘ Born here , ’

325927	325941	325919	325919	he	766	‘ My good Frederick , sit down . You are very feeble indeed . ’

327735	327753	327703	327727	a native gentleman in a suit of grease and a cap of the same material , giving chase at a distance of some fifty yards	8134	‘ Hi ! Ice - say ! You ! Seer ! Ice - say ! Nice Oatel ! ’
327898	327903	327904	327904	he	8132	‘ So Pancks said , ’

328174	328183	328184	328184	Clennam	313	‘ Ice - say ! Seer ! Who ? ’
328203	328213	328215	328217	the peasant woman	8152	‘ Enter then and ascend , if you please , ’
328286	328290	328292	328292	Clennam	313	‘ Monsieur Blandois , ’
328294	328300	328292	328292	Clennam	313	‘ With pleasure , Monsieur . ’
328488	328499	328475	328475	her	11659	‘ Pardon me , Miss Wade . I am alone . ’
328500	328512	328475	328475	her	11659	‘ It was not your name that was brought to me . ’
328513	328554	328475	328475	her	11659	‘ No ; I know that . Excuse me . I have already had experience that my name does not predispose you to an interview ; and I ventured to mention the name of one I am in search of . ’
328555	328558	328559	328559	she	11659	‘ Pray , ’
328574	328583	328559	328559	she	11659	‘ what name was it that you gave ? ’
328584	328592	328475	328475	her	11659	‘ I mentioned the name of Blandois . ’
328593	328596	328475	328475	her	11659	‘ Blandois ? ’
328597	328605	328475	328475	her	11659	‘ A name you are acquainted with . ’
328606	328611	328612	328612	she	11659	‘ It is strange , ’
328617	328649	328612	328612	she	11659	‘ that you should still press an undesired interest in me and my acquaintances , in me and my affairs , Mr Clennam . I do n’t know what you mean . ’
328650	328659	328475	328475	her	11659	‘ Pardon me . You know the name ? ’
328660	328749	328475	328475	her	11659	‘ What can you have to do with the name ? What can I have to do with the name ? What can you have to do with my knowing or not knowing any name ? I know many names and I have forgotten many more . This may be in the one class , or it may be in the other , or I may never have heard it . I am acquainted with no reason for examining myself , or for being examined , about it . ’
328750	328757	328759	328759	Clennam	304	‘ If you will allow me , ’
328761	328815	328759	328759	Clennam	304	‘ I will tell you my reason for pressing the subject . I admit that I do press it , and I must beg you to forgive me if I do so , very earnestly . The reason is all mine , I do not insinuate that it is in any way yours . ’
328816	328821	328822	328822	she	8166	‘ Well , sir , ’
328852	328896	328850	328850	herself	8166	‘ I am at least glad to know that this is not another bondswoman of some friend of yours , who is bereft of free choice , and whom I have spirited away . I will hear your reason , if you please . ’
328897	328909	328911	328911	Clennam	304	‘ First , to identify the person of whom we speak , ’
328913	328943	328911	328911	Clennam	304	‘ let me observe that it is the person you met in London some time back . You will remember meeting him near the river -- in the Adelphi ! ’
328944	328954	328955	328955	she	8167	‘ You mix yourself most unaccountably with my business , ’
328966	328973	328955	328955	she	8167	‘ How do you know that ? ’
328974	328988	328850	328850	herself	8166	‘ I entreat you not to take it ill . By mere accident . ’
328989	328993	328850	328850	herself	8166	‘ What accident ? ’
328994	329010	328955	328955	she	8167	‘ Solely the accident of coming upon you in the street and seeing the meeting . ’
329011	329024	328850	328850	herself	8166	‘ Do you speak of yourself , or of some one else ? ’
329025	329033	328850	328850	herself	8166	‘ Of myself . I saw it . ’
329034	329045	329046	329046	she	8167	‘ To be sure it was in the open street , ’
329060	329077	329046	329046	she	8167	‘ Fifty people might have seen it . It would have signified nothing if they had . ’
329078	329119	328850	328850	herself	8166	‘ Nor do I make my having seen it of any moment , nor ( otherwise than as an explanation of my coming here ) do I connect my visit with it or the favour that I have to ask . ’
329120	329135	329046	329046	she	8167	‘ Oh ! You have to ask a favour ! It occurred to me , ’
329145	329155	329156	329156	He	8168	‘ that your manner was softened , Mr Clennam . ’
329178	329358	329173	329173	He	8168	’ disappearance , of which it was probable she had heard ? However probable it was to him , she had heard of no such thing . Let him look round him ( she said ) and judge for himself what general intelligence was likely to reach the ears of a woman who had been shut up there while it was rife , devouring her own heart . When she had uttered this denial , which he believed to be true , she asked him what he meant by disappearance ? That led to his narrating the circumstances in detail , and expressing something of his anxiety to discover what had really become of the man , and to repel the dark suspicions that clouded about his mother ’s house . She heard him with evident surprise , and with more marks of suppressed interest than he had seen in her ; still they did not overcome her distant , proud , and self - secluded manner . When he had finished , she said nothing but these words : ‘
329392	329393	329394	329394	I	0	’ ‘
329397	329412	329394	329394	I	0	’ said Arthur , persevering , in his endeavour to soften her scornful demeanour , ‘
329426	329427	329428	329428	You	933	’ ‘
329439	329443	329436	329436	you	933	’ she remarked ; ‘
329462	329463	329436	329436	you	933	’ ‘
329475	329493	329494	329494	you	933	’ said Clennam , changing the form of his position in the hope of making it unobjectionable , ‘
329590	329591	329592	329592	You	933	’ ‘
329604	329630	329592	329592	You	933	’ she observed , after being , to his mortification , evidently more occupied with her own reflections on the matter than with his appeal . ‘
329638	329639	329632	329632	you	933	’ ‘
329691	329711	329678	329678	You	8179	’ He handed her one of the printed bills , which she read with a steady and attentive face . ‘
329723	329752	329717	329717	I	0	’ she said , giving it back . Clennam ’s looks expressed his heavy disappointment , perhaps his incredulity ; for she added in the same unsympathetic tone : ‘
329801	329833	329794	329794	she	9883	’ A sufficiently expressive hint of suspicion was conveyed in these words , and in the smile by which they were accompanied , to bring the blood into Clennam ’s cheeks . ‘
329838	329851	329836	329836	sir	933	’ she said , with a cruel pleasure in repeating the stab , ‘
329947	329979	329981	329981	he	8182	’ She took her revenge for her old grudge in thus turning his subject against him . Hers was not the nature to spare him , and she had no compunction . ‘
330177	330178	330179	330180	My mother	9736	’ ‘
330187	330191	330179	330180	My mother	9736	’ said Clennam , ‘
330206	330207	330179	330180	My mother	9736	’ ‘
330227	330232	330179	330180	My mother	9736	’ returned Miss Wade ; ‘
330242	330243	330244	330244	You	8184	’ ‘
330247	330269	330244	330244	You	8184	’ said Arthur , smarting under these cool - handed thrusts , of which he had deeply felt the force already , ‘
330274	330275	330276	330277	Mr Clennam	304	’ ‘
330279	330284	330276	330277	Mr Clennam	304	’ she composedly interrupted , ‘
330343	330377	330333	330333	you	304	’ Wrung by her persistence in keeping that dark side of the case before him , of which there was a half - hidden shadow in his own breast , Clennam was silent . ‘
330387	330391	330378	330378	I	0	’ she added , ‘
330422	330465	330466	330466	He	10193	’ With a heavy sigh and a despondent air , Arthur Clennam slowly rose . She did not rise also , but said , having looked at him in the meanwhile with a fixed look of suspicion , and lips angrily compressed : ‘
330495	330525	330486	330486	you	0	’ The denial that he was a dear friend rose to Arthur ’s lips ; but he repressed it , remembering his old struggles and resolutions , and said : ‘
330558	330559	330551	330553	a chance acquaintance	8195	’ ‘
330566	330570	330551	330553	a chance acquaintance	8195	’ she repeated . ‘
330603	330692	330596	330596	I	0	’ The anger with which she said it , the more remarkable for being so much under her restraint , fixed Clennam ’s attention , and kept him on the spot . It flashed out of her dark eyes as they regarded him , quivered in her nostrils , and fired the very breath she exhaled ; but her face was otherwise composed into a disdainful serenity ; and her attitude was as calmly and haughtily graceful as if she had been in a mood of complete indifference . ‘
330702	330706	330694	330694	I	0	’ he remarked , ‘
330726	330727	330728	330728	You	0	’ ‘
330739	330743	330745	330745	his	12589	’ she returned , ‘
330751	330752	330745	330745	his	12589	’ ‘
330765	330775	330745	330745	his	12589	’ said Arthur , in spite of his resolutions , ‘
330789	330790	330786	330787	Miss Wade	305	’ ‘
330795	330799	330793	330793	him	14532	’ she returned . ‘
330977	331050	330972	330972	I	0	’ Arthur begged her to give it to him . She went to the bureau , unlocked it , and took from an inner drawer a few folded sheets of paper . Without any conciliation of him , scarcely addressing him , rather speaking as if she were speaking to her own looking - glass for the justification of her own stubbornness , she said , as she gave them to him : ‘
331109	331124	331104	331104	Harriet	297	’ She called Harriet again . The second call produced Harriet , once Tattycoram . ‘
331130	331135	331127	331128	Mr Clennam	304	’ said Miss Wade ; ‘
331154	331155	331147	331147	you	297	’ ‘
331165	331169	331186	331186	He	304	’ assented Clennam . ‘
331192	331193	331186	331186	He	304	’ ‘

332095	332101	332063	332063	they	8234	’ said the girl passionately . ‘

332156	332171	332142	332142	she	305	’ said Miss Wade , with no less anger , haughtiness , and bitterness ; ‘
332212	332869	332871	332871	her	8239	’ Arthur Clennam looked at them , standing a little distance asunder in the dull confined room , each proudly cherishing her own anger ; each , with a fixed determination , torturing her own breast , and torturing the other ’s . He said a word or two of leave - taking ; but Miss Wade barely inclined her head , and Harriet , with the assumed humiliation of an abject dependent and serf ( but not without defiance for all that ) , made as if she were too low to notice or to be noticed . He came down the dark winding stairs into the yard with an increased sense upon him of the gloom of the wall that was dead , and of the shrubs that were dead , and of the fountain that was dry , and of the statue that was gone . Pondering much on what he had seen and heard in that house , as well as on the failure of all his efforts to trace the suspicious character who was lost , he returned to London and to England by the packet that had taken him over . On the way he unfolded the sheets of paper , and read in them what is reproduced in the next chapter . CHAPTER 21 . The History of a Self - Tormentor I have the misfortune of not being a fool . From a very early age I have detected what those about me thought they hid from me . If I could have been habitually imposed upon , instead of habitually discerning the truth , I might have lived as smoothly as most fools do . My childhood was passed with a grandmother ; that is to say , with a lady who represented that relative to me , and who took that title on herself . She had no claim to it , but I -- being to that extent a little fool -- had no suspicion of her . She had some children of her own family in her house , and some children of other people . All girls ; ten in number , including me . We all lived together and were educated together . I must have been about twelve years old when I began to see how determinedly those girls patronised me . I was told I was an orphan . There was no other orphan among us ; and I perceived ( here was the first disadvantage of not being a fool ) that they conciliated me in an insolent pity , and in a sense of superiority . I did not set this down as a discovery , rashly . I tried them often . I could hardly make them quarrel with me . When I succeeded with any of them , they were sure to come after an hour or two , and begin a reconciliation . I tried them over and over again , and I never knew them wait for me to begin . They were always forgiving me , in their vanity and condescension . Little images of grown people ! One of them was my chosen friend . I loved that stupid mite in a passionate way that she could no more deserve than I can remember without feeling ashamed of , though I was but a child . She had what they called an amiable temper , an affectionate temper . She could distribute , and did distribute pretty looks and smiles to every one among them . I believe there was not a soul in the place , except myself , who knew that she did it purposely to wound and gall me ! Nevertheless , I so loved that unworthy girl that my life was made stormy by my fondness for her . I was constantly lectured and disgraced for what was called ‘
332873	333256	332871	332871	her	8239	’ in other words charging her with her little perfidy and throwing her into tears by showing her that I read her heart . However , I loved her faithfully ; and one time I went home with her for the holidays . She was worse at home than she had been at school . She had a crowd of cousins and acquaintances , and we had dances at her house , and went out to dances at other houses , and , both at home and out , she tormented my love beyond endurance . Her plan was , to make them all fond of her -- and so drive me wild with jealousy . To be familiar and endearing with them all -- and so make me mad with envying them . When we were left alone in our bedroom at night , I would reproach her with my perfect knowledge of her baseness ; and then she would cry and cry and say I was cruel , and then I would hold her in my arms till morning : loving her as much as ever , and often feeling as if , rather than suffer so , I could so hold her in my arms and plunge to the bottom of a river -- where I would still hold her after we were both dead . It came to an end , and I was relieved . In the family there was an aunt who was not fond of me . I doubt if any of the family liked me much ; but I never wanted them to like me , being altogether bound up in the one girl . The aunt was a young woman , and she had a serious way with her eyes of watching me . She was an audacious woman , and openly looked compassionately at me . After one of the nights that I have spoken of , I came down into a greenhouse before breakfast . Charlotte ( the name of my false young friend ) had gone down before me , and I heard this aunt speaking to her about me as I entered . I stopped where I was , among the leaves , and listened . The aunt said , ‘
333273	333293	333259	333260	Miss Wade	305	’ I repeat the very words I heard . Now , what did she answer ? Did she say , ‘
333338	333380	333330	333330	she	305	’ No ; my first memorable experience was true to what I knew her to be , and to all my experience . She began sobbing and weeping ( to secure the aunt ’s sympathy to herself ) , and said , ‘
333410	333440	333405	333405	we	8244	’ Upon that the aunt fondled her , as if she had said something noble instead of despicable and false , and kept up the infamous pretence by replying , ‘
333477	333499	333458	333461	this poor miserable girl	8246	’ The poor miserable girl came out of her concealment , as you may be prepared to hear , and said , ‘
333504	333522	333458	333461	this poor miserable girl	8246	’ I never said another word to either of them , or to any of them , but ‘
333538	334089	333458	333461	this poor miserable girl	8246	’ When I got home , I told my supposed grandmother that , unless I was sent away to finish my education somewhere else before that girl came back , or before any one of them came back , I would burn my sight away by throwing myself into the fire , rather than I would endure to look at their plotting faces . I went among young women next , and I found them no better . Fair words and fair pretences ; but I penetrated below those assertions of themselves and depreciations of me , and they were no better . Before I left them , I learned that I had no grandmother and no recognised relation . I carried the light of that information both into my past and into my future . It showed me many new occasions on which people triumphed over me , when they made a pretence of treating me with consideration , or doing me a service . A man of business had a small property in trust for me . I was to be a governess ; I became a governess ; and went into the family of a poor nobleman , where there were two daughters -- little children , but the parents wished them to grow up , if possible , under one instructress . The mother was young and pretty . From the first , she made a show of behaving to me with great delicacy . I kept my resentment to myself ; but I knew very well that it was her way of petting the knowledge that she was my Mistress , and might have behaved differently to her servant if it had been her fancy . I say I did not resent it , nor did I ; but I showed her , by not gratifying her , that I understood her . When she pressed me to take wine , I took water . If there happened to be anything choice at table , she always sent it to me : but I always declined it , and ate of the rejected dishes . These disappointments of her patronage were a sharp retort , and made me feel independent . I liked the children . They were timid , but on the whole disposed to attach themselves to me . There was a nurse , however , in the house , a rosy - faced woman always making an obtrusive pretence of being gay and good - humoured , who had nursed them both , and who had secured their affections before I saw them . I could almost have settled down to my fate but for this woman . Her artful devices for keeping herself before the children in constant competition with me , might have blinded many in my place ; but I saw through them from the first . On the pretext of arranging my rooms and waiting on me and taking care of my wardrobe ( all of which she did busily ) , she was never absent . The most crafty of her many subtleties was her feint of seeking to make the children fonder of me . She would lead them to me and coax them to me . ‘
334148	334210	334145	334146	Miss Wade	305	’ How could I engage their attentions , when my heart was burning against these ignorant designs ? How could I wonder , when I saw their innocent faces shrinking away , and their arms twining round her neck , instead of mine ? Then she would look up at me , shaking their curls from her face , and say , ‘
334221	334294	334220	334220	they	8251	’re very simple and loving , ma’am ; do n’t be at all cast down about it , ma’am’--exulting over me ! There was another thing the woman did . At times , when she saw that she had safely plunged me into a black despondent brooding by these means , she would call the attention of the children to it , and would show them the difference between herself and me . ‘
334361	334413	334414	334415	Miss Wade	305	’ It became intolerable . Her ladyship , my Mistress , coming in one day when I was alone , and at the height of feeling that I could support it no longer , I told her I must go . I could not bear the presence of that woman Dawes . ‘
334430	334464	334465	334465	I	0	’ I knew beforehand she would say so ; I was quite prepared for it ; I only answered , it was not for me to contradict my Mistress ; I must go . ‘
334471	334488	334465	334465	I	0	’ she returned , instantly assuming the tone of superiority she had always so thinly concealed , ‘
334533	334586	334587	334588	Miss Wade	305	’ I replied that I had no complaint to make , either of my Mistress or to my Mistress ; but I must go . She hesitated a moment , and then sat down beside me , and laid her hand on mine . As if that honour would obliterate any remembrance ! ‘
334605	334620	334621	334621	I	0	’ I smiled , thinking of the experience the word awakened , and said , ‘
334630	334631	334632	334632	I	0	’ ‘
334638	334639	334632	334632	I	0	’ ‘
334650	334653	334632	334632	I	0	’ said I. ‘
334702	334703	334694	334694	you	305	’ ‘
334717	334720	334708	334708	You	305	’ said I. ‘
334744	334759	334760	334760	I	0	’ ( She had not expected my reply , and it shamed her . ) ‘
334866	336150	334847	334898	a very dear sister who was not in law his sister , but who was universally beloved and respected-- ’ I saw directly that they had taken me in for the sake of the dead woman , whoever she was , and to have that boast of me and advantage of me	15595	’ I saw directly that they had taken me in for the sake of the dead woman , whoever she was , and to have that boast of me and advantage of me ; I saw , in the nurse ’s knowledge of it , an encouragement to goad me as she had done ; and I saw , in the children ’s shrinking away , a vague impression , that I was not like other people . I left that house that night . After one or two short and very similar experiences , which are not to the present purpose , I entered another family where I had but one pupil : a girl of fifteen , who was the only daughter . The parents here were elderly people : people of station , and rich . A nephew whom they had brought up was a frequent visitor at the house , among many other visitors ; and he began to pay me attention . I was resolute in repulsing him ; for I had determined when I went there , that no one should pity me or condescend to me . But he wrote me a letter . It led to our being engaged to be married . He was a year younger than I , and young - looking even when that allowance was made . He was on absence from India , where he had a post that was soon to grow into a very good one . In six months we were to be married , and were to go to India . I was to stay in the house , and was to be married from the house . Nobody objected to any part of the plan . I can not avoid saying he admired me ; but , if I could , I would . Vanity has nothing to do with the declaration , for his admiration worried me . He took no pains to hide it ; and caused me to feel among the rich people as if he had bought me for my looks , and made a show of his purchase to justify himself . They appraised me in their own minds , I saw , and were curious to ascertain what my full value was . I resolved that they should not know . I was immovable and silent before them ; and would have suffered any one of them to kill me sooner than I would have laid myself out to bespeak their approval . He told me I did not do myself justice . I told him I did , and it was because I did and meant to do so to the last , that I would not stoop to propitiate any of them . He was concerned and even shocked , when I added that I wished he would not parade his attachment before them ; but he said he would sacrifice even the honest impulses of his affection to my peace . Under that pretence he began to retort upon me . By the hour together , he would keep at a distance from me , talking to any one rather than to me . I have sat alone and unnoticed , half an evening , while he conversed with his young cousin , my pupil . I have seen all the while , in people ’s eyes , that they thought the two looked nearer on an equality than he and I. I have sat , divining their thoughts , until I have felt that his young appearance made me ridiculous , and have raged against myself for ever loving him . For I did love him once . Undeserving as he was , and little as he thought of all these agonies that it cost me -- agonies which should have made him wholly and gratefully mine to his life ’s end -- I loved him . I bore with his cousin ’s praising him to my face , and with her pretending to think that it pleased me , but full well knowing that it rankled in my breast ; for his sake . While I have sat in his presence recalling all my slights and wrongs , and deliberating whether I should not fly from the house at once and never see him again -- I have loved him . His aunt ( my Mistress you will please to remember ) deliberately , wilfully , added to my trials and vexations . It was her delight to expatiate on the style in which we were to live in India , and on the establishment we should keep , and the company we should entertain when he got his advancement . My pride rose against this barefaced way of pointing out the contrast my married life was to present to my then dependent and inferior position . I suppressed my indignation ; but I showed her that her intention was not lost upon me , and I repaid her annoyance by affecting humility . What she described would surely be a great deal too much honour for me , I would tell her . I was afraid I might not be able to support so great a change . Think of a mere governess , her daughter ’s governess , coming to that high distinction ! It made her uneasy , and made them all uneasy , when I answered in this way . They knew that I fully understood her . It was at the time when my troubles were at their highest , and when I was most incensed against my lover for his ingratitude in caring as little as he did for the innumerable distresses and mortifications I underwent on his account , that your dear friend , Mr Gowan , appeared at the house . He had been intimate there for a long time , but had been abroad . He understood the state of things at a glance , and he understood me . He was the first person I had ever seen in my life who had understood me . He was not in the house three times before I knew that he accompanied every movement of my mind . In his coldly easy way with all of them , and with me , and with the whole subject , I saw it clearly . In his light protestations of admiration of my future husband , in his enthusiasm regarding our engagement and our prospects , in his hopeful congratulations on our future wealth and his despondent references to his own poverty -- all equally hollow , and jesting , and full of mockery -- I saw it clearly . He made me feel more and more resentful , and more and more contemptible , by always presenting to me everything that surrounded me with some new hateful light upon it , while he pretended to exhibit it in its best aspect for my admiration and his own . He was like the dressed - up Death in the Dutch series ; whatever figure he took upon his arm , whether it was youth or age , beauty or ugliness , whether he danced with it , sang with it , played with it , or prayed with it , he made it ghastly . You will understand , then , that when your dear friend complimented me , he really condoled with me ; that when he soothed me under my vexations , he laid bare every smarting wound I had ; that when he declared my ‘
336153	336156	334847	334898	a very dear sister who was not in law his sister , but who was universally beloved and respected-- ’ I saw directly that they had taken me in for the sake of the dead woman , whoever she was , and to have that boast of me and advantage of me	15595	’ to be ‘
336174	337092	337700	337700	Doyce	374	’ he touched my old misgiving that I was made ridiculous . These were not great services , you may say . They were acceptable to me , because they echoed my own mind , and confirmed my own knowledge . I soon began to like the society of your dear friend better than any other . When I perceived ( which I did , almost as soon ) that jealousy was growing out of this , I liked this society still better . Had I not been subject to jealousy , and were the endurances to be all mine ? No . Let him know what it was ! I was delighted that he should know it ; I was delighted that he should feel keenly , and I hoped he did . More than that . He was tame in comparison with Mr Gowan , who knew how to address me on equal terms , and how to anatomise the wretched people around us . This went on , until the aunt , my Mistress , took it upon herself to speak to me . It was scarcely worth alluding to ; she knew I meant nothing ; but she suggested from herself , knowing it was only necessary to suggest , that it might be better if I were a little less companionable with Mr Gowan . I asked her how she could answer for what I meant ? She could always answer , she replied , for my meaning nothing wrong . I thanked her , but said I would prefer to answer for myself and to myself . Her other servants would probably be grateful for good characters , but I wanted none . Other conversation followed , and induced me to ask her how she knew that it was only necessary for her to make a suggestion to me , to have it obeyed ? Did she presume on my birth , or on my hire ? I was not bought , body and soul . She seemed to think that her distinguished nephew had gone into a slave - market and purchased a wife . It would probably have come , sooner or later , to the end to which it did come , but she brought it to its issue at once . She told me , with assumed commiseration , that I had an unhappy temper . On this repetition of the old wicked injury , I withheld no longer , but exposed to her all I had known of her and seen in her , and all I had undergone within myself since I had occupied the despicable position of being engaged to her nephew . I told her that Mr Gowan was the only relief I had had in my degradation ; that I had borne it too long , and that I shook it off too late ; but that I would see none of them more . And I never did . Your dear friend followed me to my retreat , and was very droll on the severance of the connection ; though he was sorry , too , for the excellent people ( in their way the best he had ever met ) , and deplored the necessity of breaking mere house - flies on the wheel . He protested before long , and far more truly than I then supposed , that he was not worth acceptance by a woman of such endowments , and such power of character ; but -- well , well-- ! Your dear friend amused me and amused himself as long as it suited his inclinations ; and then reminded me that we were both people of the world , that we both understood mankind , that we both knew there was no such thing as romance , that we were both prepared for going different ways to seek our fortunes like people of sense , and that we both foresaw that whenever we encountered one another again we should meet as the best friends on earth . So he said , and I did not contradict him . It was not very long before I found that he was courting his present wife , and that she had been taken away to be out of his reach . I hated her then , quite as much as I hate her now ; and naturally , therefore , could desire nothing better than that she should marry him . But I was restlessly curious to look at her -- so curious that I felt it to be one of the few sources of entertainment left to me . I travelled a little : travelled until I found myself in her society , and in yours . Your dear friend , I think , was not known to you then , and had not given you any of those signal marks of his friendship which he has bestowed upon you . In that company I found a girl , in various circumstances of whose position there was a singular likeness to my own , and in whose character I was interested and pleased to see much of the rising against swollen patronage and selfishness , calling themselves kindness , protection , benevolence , and other fine names , which I have described as inherent in my nature . I often heard it said , too , that she had ‘
337097	337668	334847	334898	a very dear sister who was not in law his sister , but who was universally beloved and respected-- ’ I saw directly that they had taken me in for the sake of the dead woman , whoever she was , and to have that boast of me and advantage of me	15595	’ Well understanding what was meant by the convenient phrase , and wanting a companion with a knowledge of what I knew , I thought I would try to release the girl from her bondage and sense of injustice . I have no occasion to relate that I succeeded . We have been together ever since , sharing my small means . CHAPTER 22 . Who passes by this Road so late ? Arthur Clennam had made his unavailing expedition to Calais in the midst of a great pressure of business . A certain barbaric Power with valuable possessions on the map of the world , had occasion for the services of one or two engineers , quick in invention and determined in execution : practical men , who could make the men and means their ingenuity perceived to be wanted out of the best materials they could find at hand ; and who were as bold and fertile in the adaptation of such materials to their purpose , as in the conception of their purpose itself . This Power , being a barbaric one , had no idea of stowing away a great national object in a Circumlocution Office , as strong wine is hidden from the light in a cellar until its fire and youth are gone , and the labourers who worked in the vineyard and pressed the grapes are dust . With characteristic ignorance , it acted on the most decided and energetic notions of How to do it ; and never showed the least respect for , or gave any quarter to , the great political science , How not to do it . Indeed it had a barbarous way of striking the latter art and mystery dead , in the person of any enlightened subject who practised it . Accordingly , the men who were wanted were sought out and found ; which was in itself a most uncivilised and irregular way of proceeding . Being found , they were treated with great confidence and honour ( which again showed dense political ignorance ) , and were invited to come at once and do what they had to do . In short , they were regarded as men who meant to do it , engaging with other men who meant it to be done . Daniel Doyce was one of the chosen . There was no foreseeing at that time whether he would be absent months or years . The preparations for his departure , and the conscientious arrangement for him of all the details and results of their joint business , had necessitated labour within a short compass of time , which had occupied Clennam day and night . He had slipped across the water in his first leisure , and had slipped as quickly back again for his farewell interview with Doyce . Him Arthur now showed , with pains and care , the state of their gains and losses , responsibilities and prospects . Daniel went through it all in his patient manner , and admired it all exceedingly . He audited the accounts , as if they were a far more ingenious piece of mechanism than he had ever constructed , and afterwards stood looking at them , weighing his hat over his head by the brims , as if he were absorbed in the contemplation of some wonderful engine . ‘

Doyce was to go to Southampton to join the small staff of his fellow - travellers ; and a coach was at the gate , well furnished and packed , and ready to take him there . The workmen were at the gate to see him off , and were mightily proud of him . ‘

341701	341712	341693	341694	Mr Flintwinch	320	‘ why it should trouble _ you _ , Arthur . ’
341713	341716	341722	341723	Mr Flintwinch	320	‘ No ? ’
341717	341720	341722	341723	Mr Flintwinch	320	‘ No , ’
341747	341779	341733	341733	he	320	‘ Is it nothing to see those placards about ? Is it nothing to me to see my mother ’s name and residence hawked up and down in such an association ? ’
341780	341786	341788	341789	Mr Flintwinch	320	‘ I do n’t see , ’
341796	341817	341788	341789	Mr Flintwinch	320	‘ that it need signify much to you . But I ’ll tell you what I do see , Arthur , ’
341824	341839	341788	341789	Mr Flintwinch	320	‘ I see the light of fire and candle in your mother ’s room ! ’
341840	341850	341867	341867	himself	320	‘ And what has that to do with it ? ’
341851	341861	341863	341864	Mr Flintwinch	320	‘ Why , sir , I read by it , ’
341871	341906	341867	341867	himself	320	‘ that if it ’s advisable ( as the proverb says it is ) to let sleeping dogs lie , it ’s just as advisable , perhaps , to let missing dogs lie . Let ‘
341917	342046	341910	341910	They	8354	’ Mr Flintwinch turned short round when he had made this remark , and went into the dark hall . Clennam stood there , following him with his eyes , as he dipped for a light in the phosphorus - box in the little room at the side , got one after three or four dips , and lighted the dim lamp against the wall . All the while , Clennam was pursuing the probabilities -- rather as if they were being shown to him by an invisible hand than as if he himself were conjuring them up -- of Mr Flintwinch ’s ways and means of doing that darker deed , and removing its traces by any of the black avenues of shadow that lay around them . ‘
342051	342057	342049	342049	sir	933	’ said the testy Jeremiah ; ‘
342068	342069	342070	342070	My	0	’ ‘
342078	342079	342075	342075	I	0	’ ‘
342083	342088	342075	342075	I	0	’ said Mr Flintwinch . ‘
342116	342530	342098	342098	They	8359	’ This was the second disappointment . Arthur made no remark upon it , and repaired to his mother ’s room , where Mr Casby and Flora had been taking tea , anchovy paste , and hot buttered toast . The relics of those delicacies were not yet removed , either from the table or from the scorched countenance of Affery , who , with the kitchen toasting - fork still in her hand , looked like a sort of allegorical personage ; except that she had a considerable advantage over the general run of such personages in point of significant emblematical purpose . Flora had spread her bonnet and shawl upon the bed , with a care indicative of an intention to stay some time . Mr Casby , too , was beaming near the hob , with his benevolent knobs shining as if the warm butter of the toast were exuding through the patriarchal skull , and with his face as ruddy as if the colouring matter of the anchovy paste were mantling in the patriarchal visage . Seeing this , as he exchanged the usual salutations , Clennam decided to speak to his mother without postponement . It had long been customary , as she never changed her room , for those who had anything to say to her apart , to wheel her to her desk ; where she sat , usually with the back of her chair turned towards the rest of the room , and the person who talked with her seated in a corner , on a stool which was always set in that place for that purpose . Except that it was long since the mother and son had spoken together without the intervention of a third person , it was an ordinary matter of course within the experience of visitors for Mrs Clennam to be asked , with a word of apology for the interruption , if she could be spoken with on a matter of business , and , on her replying in the affirmative , to be wheeled into the position described . Therefore , when Arthur now made such an apology , and such a request , and moved her to her desk and seated himself on the stool , Mrs Finching merely began to talk louder and faster , as a delicate hint that she could overhear nothing , and Mr Casby stroked his long white locks with sleepy calmness . ‘
342567	342568	342569	342569	I	0	’ ‘
342584	342622	342582	342582	Arthur	304	’ She spoke aloud . He had lowered his own voice ; but she rejected that advance towards confidence as she rejected every other , and spoke in her usual key and in her usual stern voice . ‘
342639	342659	342660	342660	I	0	’ She asked him , exactly as before , if he were there to tell her what it was ? ‘
342670	342671	342660	342660	I	0	’ ‘
342677	342678	342679	342679	He	8363	’ ‘
342689	342695	342682	342683	a prisoner	9839	’ She answered with composure , ‘

342720	342744	342712	342712	mother	953	’ She started at the word , and her looks expressed her natural horror . Yet she still spoke aloud , when she demanded:-- ‘
342750	342751	342752	342759	A man who was his fellow - prisoner	8370	’ ‘
342761	342762	342752	342759	A man who was his fellow - prisoner	8370	’ ‘

342855	342909	342913	342913	you	0	’ Arthur had no choice but to say that his informant had not become known to him through the agency of any such credentials , or indeed of any credentials at all . Mrs Clennam ’s attentive frown expanded by degrees into a severe look of triumph , and she retorted with emphasis , ‘
342936	342997	342919	342919	I	0	’ Her emphasis had been derived from her eyes quite as much as from the stress she laid upon her words . She continued to look at him ; and if , when he entered the house , he had had any latent hope of prevailing in the least with her , she now looked it out of his heart . ‘
343008	343009	343001	343001	I	0	’ ‘
343012	343013	343001	343001	I	0	’ ‘

343096	343171	343172	343173	A prisoner	9839	’ Glancing at Jeremiah , Clennam saw in his very gaiters that his attention was closely directed to them , though he stood leaning against the wall scraping his jaw , and pretended to listen to Flora as she held forth in a most distracting manner on a chaos of subjects , in which mackerel , and Mr F. ’s Aunt in a swing , had become entangled with cockchafers and the wine trade . ‘
343186	343200	343172	343173	A prisoner	9839	’ repeated Mrs Clennam , steadily going over what her son had said . ‘

343290	343314	343277	343277	Arthur	304	’ He interrupted her hastily , for it had not entered his imagination that she would openly proclaim what he had told her . ‘
343318	343324	343277	343277	Arthur	304	’ she said with displeasure . ‘
343328	343329	343330	343330	I	0	’ ‘
343355	343471	343353	343354	my mother--	8389	’ He had laid his hand upon her chair , or she would otherwise have wheeled it round with the touch of her foot upon the ground . They were still face to face . She looked at him , as he ran over the possibilities of some result he had not intended , and could not foresee , being influenced by Cavalletto ’s disclosure becoming a matter of notoriety , and hurriedly arrived at the conclusion that it had best not be talked about ; though perhaps he was guided by no more distinct reason than that he had taken it for granted that his mother would reserve it to herself and her partner . ‘
343475	343482	343353	343354	my mother--	8389	’ she said again , impatiently . ‘
343487	343488	343489	343489	I	0	’ ‘
343514	343515	343507	343507	you	953	’ ‘

343546	343555	343539	343539	you	0	’ said she , holding up her hand , ‘
343643	343959	343961	343961	you	8393	’ He yielded to her imperious but elated look , and turned her chair back to the place from which he had wheeled it . In doing so he saw elation in the face of Mr Flintwinch , which most assuredly was not inspired by Flora . This turning of his intelligence and of his whole attempt and design against himself , did even more than his mother ’s fixedness and firmness to convince him that his efforts with her were idle . Nothing remained but the appeal to his old friend Affery . But even to get the very doubtful and preliminary stage of making the appeal , seemed one of the least promising of human undertakings . She was so completely under the thrall of the two clever ones , was so systematically kept in sight by one or other of them , and was so afraid to go about the house besides , that every opportunity of speaking to her alone appeared to be forestalled . Over and above that , Mistress Affery , by some means ( it was not very difficult to guess , through the sharp arguments of her liege lord ) , had acquired such a lively conviction of the hazard of saying anything under any circumstances , that she had remained all this time in a corner guarding herself from approach with that symbolical instrument of hers ; so that , when a word or two had been addressed to her by Flora , or even by the bottle - green patriarch himself , she had warded off conversation with the toasting - fork like a dumb woman . After several abortive attempts to get Affery to look at him while she cleared the table and washed the tea - service , Arthur thought of an expedient which Flora might originate . To whom he therefore whispered , ‘
343972	344048	343961	343961	you	8393	’ Now , poor Flora , being always in fluctuating expectation of the time when Clennam would renew his boyhood and be madly in love with her again , received the whisper with the utmost delight ; not only as rendered precious by its mysterious character , but as preparing the way for a tender interview in which he would declare the state of his affections . She immediately began to work out the hint . ‘
344057	344064	343961	343961	you	8393	’ said Flora , glancing round , ‘
344248	344270	344282	344284	its worst enemy	8401	’ Having paid the tribute of a sigh to the instability of human existence , Flora hurried on with her purpose . ‘
344277	344281	344282	344284	its worst enemy	8401	’ she proceeded , ‘
344404	344470	344517	344517	Affery	312	’ Mrs Clennam , who responded with a constrained grace to Mrs Finching ’s good nature in being there at all , though her visit ( before Arthur ’s unexpected arrival ) was undoubtedly an act of pure good nature and no self - gratification , intimated that all the house was open to her . Flora rose and looked to Arthur for his escort . ‘
344473	344479	344517	344517	Affery	312	’ said he , aloud ; ‘
344490	344496	344481	344481	Affery	312	’ Affery was excusing herself with ‘
344506	344513	344504	344504	Arthur	304	’ when Mr Flintwinch stopped her with ‘
344533	344569	344531	344531	jade	8409	’ Thus expostulated with , she came unwillingly out of her corner , resigned the toasting - fork into one of her husband ’s hands , and took the candlestick he offered from the other . ‘
344576	344580	344573	344574	you fool	15174	’ said Jeremiah . ‘
344592	344596	344582	344582	you	312	’ Flora answered , ‘
344599	344600	344582	344582	you	312	’ ‘
344611	344615	344608	344608	you	312	’ said Jeremiah . ‘
344635	344679	344622	344622	I	0	’ Affery headed the exploring party ; Jeremiah closed it . He had no intention of leaving them . Clennam looking back , and seeing him following three stairs behind , in the coolest and most methodical manner exclaimed in a low voice , ‘
344688	344697	344622	344622	I	0	’ Flora reassured his mind by replying promptly , ‘
344745	344771	344733	344733	you	304	’ Wanting the heart to explain that this was not at all what he meant , Arthur extended his supporting arm round Flora ’s figure . ‘
344777	344781	344733	344733	you	304	’ said she . ‘
344824	344932	344817	344817	I	0	’ In this preposterous attitude , unspeakably at variance with his anxious mind , Clennam descended to the basement of the house ; finding that wherever it became darker than elsewhere , Flora became heavier , and that when the house was lightest she was too . Returning from the dismal kitchen regions , which were as dreary as they could be , Mistress Affery passed with the light into his father ’s old room , and then into the old dining - room ; always passing on before like a phantom that was not to be overtaken , and neither turning nor answering when he whispered , ‘
344942	345030	344935	344935	I	0	’ In the dining - room , a sentimental desire came over Flora to look into the dragon closet which had so often swallowed Arthur in the days of his boyhood -- not improbably because , as a very dark closet , it was a likely place to be heavy in . Arthur , fast subsiding into despair , had opened it , when a knock was heard at the outer door . Mistress Affery , with a suppressed cry , threw her apron over her head . ‘
345038	345043	345033	345033	You	312	’ said Mr Flintwinch . ‘
345073	345074	345061	345061	You	312	’ ‘
345085	345089	345079	345079	anybody	1507	’ said Arthur . ‘
345105	345139	345095	345095	I	0	’ returned the old man so savagely , as to render it clear that in a choice of difficulties he felt he must go , though he would have preferred not to go . ‘
345171	345208	345209	345209	Affery	312	’ The moment he was gone , Arthur released Mrs Finching : with some difficulty , by reason of that lady misunderstanding his intentions , and making arrangements with a view to tightening instead of slackening . ‘
345216	345217	345209	345209	Affery	312	’ ‘
345225	345233	345209	345209	Affery	312	’ she cried , shrinking from him . ‘

345259	345270	345253	345253	He	8419	’ returned Arthur , suiting the action to the word , ‘

345285	345289	345280	345280	He	8419	’ cried Affery . ‘

347369	347765	347367	347368	the strangers	8465	’ cemetery at Rome . Mr and Mrs Sparkler were established in their own house : a little mansion , rather of the Tite Barnacle class , quite a triumph of inconvenience , with a perpetual smell in it of the day before yesterday ’s soup and coach - horses , but extremely dear , as being exactly in the centre of the habitable globe . In this enviable abode ( and envied it really was by many people ) , Mrs Sparkler had intended to proceed at once to the demolition of the Bosom , when active hostilities had been suspended by the arrival of the Courier with his tidings of death . Mrs Sparkler , who was not unfeeling , had received them with a violent burst of grief , which had lasted twelve hours ; after which , she had arisen to see about her mourning , and to take every precaution that could ensure its being as becoming as Mrs Merdle ’s . A gloom was then cast over more than one distinguished family ( according to the politest sources of intelligence ) , and the Courier went back again . Mr and Mrs Sparkler had been dining alone , with their gloom cast over them , and Mrs Sparkler reclined on a drawing - room sofa . It was a hot summer Sunday evening . The residence in the centre of the habitable globe , at all times stuffed and close as if it had an incurable cold in its head , was that evening particularly stifling . The bells of the churches had done their worst in the way of clanging among the unmelodious echoes of the streets , and the lighted windows of the churches had ceased to be yellow in the grey dusk , and had died out opaque black . Mrs Sparkler , lying on her sofa , looking through an open window at the opposite side of a narrow street over boxes of mignonette and flowers , was tired of the view . Mrs Sparkler , looking at another window where her husband stood in the balcony , was tired of that view . Mrs Sparkler , looking at herself in her mourning , was even tired of that view : though , naturally , not so tired of that as of the other two . ‘
347774	347784	347367	347368	the strangers	8465	’ said Mrs Sparkler , changing her position fretfully . ‘
347804	347813	347800	347800	you	557	’ Mr Sparkler might have replied with ingenuousness , ‘
347823	347855	347817	347817	I	0	’ But , as the repartee did not occur to him , he contented himself with coming in from the balcony and standing at the side of his wife ’s couch . ‘
347861	347869	347870	347870	you	557	’ said Mrs Sparkler more fretfully still , ‘
347883	347935	347936	347936	I	0	’ Mr Sparkler , in absence of mind -- perhaps in a more literal absence of mind than is usually understood by the phrase -- had smelt so hard at a sprig in his hand as to be on the verge of the offence in question . He smiled , said , ‘
347944	347952	347936	347936	I	0	’ and threw it out of window . ‘
347966	347980	347964	347964	Edmund	557	’ said Mrs Sparkler , raising her eyes to him after another minute ; ‘
347994	347995	347998	347999	my dear	969	’ ‘
348001	348015	347998	347999	my dear	969	’ said Mr Sparkler , and took a chair on the same spot . ‘
348028	348038	348017	348017	I	0	’ said Fanny , yawning in a dreary manner , ‘
348058	348059	348050	348050	I	0	’ ‘
348068	348080	348062	348062	your	557	’ asked Mr Sparkler , picking up one and presenting it . ‘

348189	348200	348186	348186	My	0	’ said Mr Sparkler , flashing with an original conception , ‘

348314	348374	348310	348310	I	0	’ Mr Sparkler looked meekly after her as she lounged about the room , and he appeared to be a little frightened . When she had tossed a few trifles about , and had looked down into the darkening street out of all the three windows , she returned to her sofa , and threw herself among its pillows . ‘
348432	348451	348424	348424	you	557	’ Mr Sparkler apologised for the circumstance , pleaded that he could n’t help it , and said that ‘
348455	348482	348424	348424	you	557	’ without more particularly indicating whose fellows , used to call him by the name of Quinbus Flestrin , Junior , or the Young Man Mountain . ‘
348492	348496	348483	348483	You	557	’ Fanny complained . ‘
348500	348508	348497	348498	My dear	969	’ returned Mr Sparkler , rather gratified , ‘

348594	348599	348591	348592	My dear	969	’ answered Mr Sparkler ; ‘

348622	348668	348619	348620	good GRACIOUS	12052	’ cried Fanny . Mr Sparkler was so discomposed by the energy of this exclamation , accompanied with a flouncing up from the sofa and a flouncing down again , that a minute or two elapsed before he felt himself equal to saying in explanation : ‘
348686	348687	348676	348676	everybody	1574	’ ‘
348694	348701	348676	348676	everybody	1574	’ retorted Fanny with great irritability ; ‘

348889	348947	348844	348844	you	0	’ Fanny took a good deal of time : lying back with her eyes shut , and her eyebrows raised with a hopeless expression as if she had utterly given up all terrestrial affairs . At length , without the slightest notice , she opened her eyes again , and recommenced in a short , sharp manner : ‘
349013	349014	349015	349015	My	0	’ ‘
349018	349023	349015	349015	My	0	’ said Mr Sparkler . ‘

349141	349181	349103	349103	your	557	’ Mr Sparkler submitted . Honouring the last feeble suggestion with no notice , Mrs Sparkler declared with bitterness that it really was too bad , and that positively it was enough to make one wish one was dead ! ‘
349184	349204	349103	349103	your	557	’ she said , when she had in some measure recovered from her sense of personal ill - usage ; ‘

349234	349239	349240	349240	Edmund	557	’ said Mr Sparkler . ‘

349289	349341	349278	349278	I	0	’ Mr Sparkler was much afflicted by the charge , and offered a most tender and earnest apology . His apology was accepted ; but Mrs Sparkler requested him to go round to the other side of the sofa and sit in the window - curtain , to tone himself down . ‘
349346	349365	349278	349278	I	0	’ she said , stretching out her fan , and touching him with it at arm ’s length , ‘
349441	349466	349470	349470	you	0	’ Mr Sparkler ’s sentiments as to the plan were , in brief , that it had no nonsense about it . He added , ‘
349482	349483	349484	349485	Dearest Amy	687	’ ‘
349489	349499	349484	349485	Dearest Amy	687	’ cried Mrs Sparkler with a sigh of affection . ‘
349515	349522	349509	349509	Amy	687	’ Mr Sparkler was going to say ‘
349525	349538	349509	349509	Amy	687	’ interrogatively , but he saw his danger and said it assentingly , ‘
349552	349553	349556	349556	Edmund	557	’ ‘
349615	349616	349602	349602	she	687	’ ‘
349621	349626	349602	349602	she	687	’ said Mr Sparkler . ‘
349629	349630	349602	349602	she	687	’ ‘
349740	349751	349735	349735	I	0	’ Here Fanny stopped to weep , and to say , ‘
349772	349773	349756	349757	beloved papa	8507	’ ‘
349782	349786	349756	349757	beloved papa	8507	’ she pursued , ‘
349924	349925	349926	349926	He	578	’ ‘
349938	349946	349926	349926	He	578	’ Mr Sparkler made bold to opine . ‘
349957	349989	349951	349951	I	0	’ returned his wife , languidly turning her eyelids a little in his direction ( she held forth , in general , as if to the drawing - room furniture ) , ‘
350038	350067	350030	350030	she	11789	’ Mr Sparkler , growing rash on his late success , observed that Edward had had , biggodd , a long bout of it , my dear girl . ‘
350073	350078	350071	350071	Edmund	557	’ returned Mrs Sparkler , ‘
350180	350229	350160	350160	you	557	’ Mr Sparkler considered it a parallel case to that of some of our fellows in the West Indies with Yellow Jack . Mrs Sparkler closed her eyes again , and refused to have any consciousness of our fellows of the West Indies , or of Yellow Jack . ‘
350234	350244	350263	350263	she	8522	’ she pursued , when she reopened her eyelids , ‘
350305	350306	350298	350298	I	0	’ ‘
350316	350321	350307	350307	I	0	’ said Mr Sparkler . ‘
350335	350340	350322	350322	I	0	’ Mrs Sparkler continued , ‘
350425	350451	350422	350423	dear papa	15220	’ She wept again , but Mrs General was the best of restoratives . The name soon stimulated her to dry her eyes and say : ‘
350547	350605	350606	350606	Halloa	330	’ Mrs Sparkler was in the full glow of her gratification , when a double knock was heard at the door . A very odd knock . Low , as if to avoid making a noise and attracting attention . Long , as if the person knocking were preoccupied in mind , and forgot to leave off . ‘
350608	350613	350606	350606	Halloa	330	’ said Mr Sparkler . ‘
350618	350619	350606	350606	Halloa	330	’ ‘
350631	350636	350606	350606	Halloa	330	’ said Mrs Sparkler . ‘
350640	350686	350606	350606	Halloa	330	’ The room was dark , but the street was lighter , because of its lamps . Mr Sparkler ’s head peeping over the balcony looked so very bulky and heavy that it seemed on the point of overbalancing him and flattening the unknown below . ‘
350692	350697	350689	350690	one fellow	8533	’ said Mr Sparkler . ‘
350707	350741	350742	350743	his governor	7578	’ On this second thought he went out into the balcony again and had another look . He came back as the door was opened , and announced that he believed he had identified ‘
350747	350769	350742	350743	his governor	7578	’ He was not mistaken , for his governor , with his tile in his hand , was introduced immediately afterwards . ‘
350772	350786	350742	350743	his governor	7578	’ said Mrs Sparkler , with a word of excuse for the darkness . ‘
350794	350819	350820	350820	I	0	’ said Mr Merdle . When the candles were brought in , Mr Merdle was discovered standing behind the door , picking his lips . ‘
350829	350833	350822	350822	I	0	’ he said . ‘
350863	350880	350856	350856	I	0	’ As he was in dinner dress , Fanny asked him where he had been dining ? ‘
350883	350888	350856	350856	I	0	’ said Mr Merdle , ‘
350898	350899	350889	350889	I	0	’ ‘
350906	350910	350902	350902	you	0	’ said Fanny . ‘
350921	350953	350915	350915	I	0	’ said Mr Merdle . He had passed his hand over his yellow forehead and considered , as if he were not sure about it . Something to eat was proposed . ‘
350959	350964	350957	350957	you	8535	’ said Mr Merdle , ‘
351019	351027	351000	351000	herself	464	’ Would he have tea or coffee ? ‘
351033	351038	351031	351031	you	8535	’ said Mr Merdle . ‘
351053	351139	351039	351039	I	0	’ At this period of his visit , Mr Merdle took the chair which Edmund Sparkler had offered him , and which he had hitherto been pushing slowly about before him , like a dull man with a pair of skates on for the first time , who could not make up his mind to start . He now put his hat upon another chair beside him , and , looking down into it as if it were some twenty feet deep , said again : ‘
351151	351152	351144	351144	I	0	’ ‘
351157	351161	351144	351144	I	0	’ said Fanny , ‘
351170	351171	351163	351163	you	0	’ ‘
351176	351196	351163	351163	you	0	’ returned Mr Merdle , who was by this time taking himself into custody under both coat - sleeves . ‘
351206	351207	351208	351208	You	0	’ ‘
351217	351221	351208	351208	You	0	’ said Fanny . ‘
351255	351256	351249	351249	You	273	’ ‘
351264	351274	351259	351259	I	0	’ replied Mr Merdle , after deliberating about it . ‘
351299	351355	351356	351356	I	0	’ The master - mind of the age , true to its characteristic of being at all times a mind that had as little as possible to say for itself and great difficulty in saying it , became mute again . Mrs Sparkler began to wonder how long the master - mind meant to stay . ‘
351369	351370	351356	351356	I	0	’ ‘
351377	351398	351399	351399	I	0	’ said Mr Merdle . Fanny did not see that ; but felt it incumbent on her to continue talking . ‘
351403	351407	351399	351399	I	0	’ she pursued , ‘
351425	351426	351399	351399	I	0	’ ‘
351429	351434	351399	351399	I	0	’ said Mr Merdle ; ‘
351443	351444	351399	351399	I	0	’ ‘
351452	351456	351399	351399	I	0	’ said Fanny . ‘
351459	351482	351399	351399	I	0	’ assented Mr Merdle , after having examined the cornice of all that part of the room which was within his range : ‘
351491	351492	351493	351493	My	0	’ ‘
351498	351502	351493	351493	My	0	’ said Fanny , ‘
351511	351512	351514	351514	She	573	’ ‘
351521	351574	351514	351514	She	573	’ said Mr Merdle . Fanny was delighted to hear him express the opinion . Mr Merdle , after taking another gaze into the depths of his hat as if he thought he saw something at the bottom , rubbed his hair and slowly appended to his last remark the confirmatory words , ‘
351587	351618	351514	351514	She	573	’ As the topic seemed exhausted , and Mr Merdle too , Fanny inquired if he were going to take up Mrs Merdle and the carriage in his way home ? ‘
351621	351625	351514	351514	She	573	’ he answered ; ‘
351639	351674	351680	351680	Fanny	342	’ here he looked all over the palms of both his hands as if he were telling his own fortune--‘to take care of herself . I dare say she ’ll manage to do it . ’
351675	351678	351680	351680	Fanny	342	‘ Probably , ’
351717	351722	351724	351725	Mr Merdle	273	‘ But , however , ’
351727	351748	351724	351725	Mr Merdle	273	‘ I am equally detaining you and myself . I thought I ’d give you a call , you know . ’
351749	351756	351758	351758	Fanny	342	‘ Charmed , I am sure , ’
351760	351766	351768	351769	Mr Merdle	273	‘ So I am off , ’
351774	351782	351768	351769	Mr Merdle	273	‘ Could you lend me a penknife ? ’
351820	351825	351826	351827	Mr Merdle	273	‘ Is n’t it ? ’
351830	351867	351826	351827	Mr Merdle	273	‘ but I want one ; and I know you have got several little wedding keepsakes about , with scissors and tweezers and such things in them . You shall have it back to - morrow . ’
351868	351871	351873	351874	Mrs Sparkler	660	‘ Edmund , ’
351876	351917	351873	351874	Mrs Sparkler	660	‘ open ( now , very carefully , I beg and beseech , for you are so very awkward ) the mother of pearl box on my little table there , and give Mr Merdle the mother of pearl penknife . ’
351918	351922	351924	351925	Mr Merdle	273	‘ Thank you , ’
351927	351950	351924	351925	Mr Merdle	273	‘ but if you have got one with a darker handle , I think I should prefer one with a darker handle . ’
351951	351956	351873	351874	Mrs Sparkler	660	‘ Tortoise - shell ? ’
351957	351961	351963	351964	Mr Merdle	273	‘ Thank you , ’
351966	351978	351963	351964	Mr Merdle	273	‘ yes . I think I should prefer tortoise - shell . ’
352016	352027	352006	352007	his wife	9851	‘ I will forgive you , if you ink it . ’
352028	352037	352039	352040	Mr Merdle	273	‘ I ’ll undertake not to ink it , ’
352527	352535	352486	352488	an attractive man	8570	‘ Come and see what I see ! ’
352610	352694	352595	352596	The guests	7135	‘ Here is a man who really has an acquaintance with us as we are , who is admitted to some of us every day with our wigs and paint off , who hears the wanderings of our minds , and sees the undisguised expression of our faces , when both are past our control ; we may as well make an approach to reality with him , for the man has got the better of us and is too strong for us . ’
353003	353008	353010	353010	Bar	479	‘ A certain bird , ’
353028	353052	353013	353013	he	479	‘ has been whispering among us lawyers lately , that there is to be an addition to the titled personages of this realm . ’
353053	353056	353058	353059	Mrs Merdle	464	‘ Really ? ’
353061	353064	353066	353066	Bar	479	‘ Yes , ’
353068	353086	353087	353087	He	479	‘ Has not the bird been whispering in very different ears from ours -- in lovely ears ? ’
353099	353105	353107	353108	Mrs Merdle	464	‘ Do you mean mine ? ’
353110	353116	353118	353118	Bar	479	‘ When I say lovely , ’
353120	353126	353118	353118	Bar	479	‘ I always mean you . ’
353127	353136	353138	353139	Mrs Merdle	464	‘ You never mean anything , I think , ’
353145	353151	353153	353153	Bar	479	‘ Oh , cruelly unjust ! ’
353155	353161	353153	353153	Bar	479	‘ But , the bird . ’
353162	353175	353177	353178	Mrs Merdle	464	‘ I am the last person in the world to hear news , ’
353185	353190	353153	353153	Bar	479	‘ Who is it ? ’
353191	353200	353202	353202	Bar	479	‘ What an admirable witness you would make ! ’
353204	353239	353202	353202	Bar	479	‘ No jury ( unless we could empanel one of blind men ) could resist you , if you were ever so bad a one ; but you would be such a good one ! ’
353240	353247	353249	353250	Mrs Merdle	464	‘ Why , you ridiculous man ? ’
353284	353314	353279	353279	his	479	‘ What am I to call the most elegant , accomplished and charming of women , a few weeks , or it may be a few days , hence ? ’
353315	353327	353329	353330	Mrs Merdle	464	‘ Did n’t your bird tell you what to call her ? ’
353332	353353	353329	353330	Mrs Merdle	464	‘ Do ask it to - morrow , and tell me the next time you see me what it says . ’
353415	353420	353421	353421	he	630	‘ May I ask , ’
353424	353431	353421	353421	he	630	‘ is this true about Merdle ? ’
353432	353437	353438	353438	she	464	‘ My dear doctor , ’
353441	353457	353421	353421	he	630	‘ you ask me the very question that I was half disposed to ask you . ’
353458	353466	353421	353421	he	630	‘ To ask me ! Why me ? ’
353467	353486	353421	353421	he	630	‘ Upon my honour , I think Mr Merdle reposes greater confidence in you than in any one . ’
353487	353510	353421	353421	he	630	‘ On the contrary , he tells me absolutely nothing , even professionally . You have heard the talk , of course ? ’
353511	353574	353421	353421	he	630	‘ Of course I have . But you know what Mr Merdle is ; you know how taciturn and reserved he is . I assure you I have no idea what foundation for it there may be . I should like it to be true ; why should I deny that to you ? You would know better , if I did ! ’
353575	353579	353581	353581	Physician	630	‘ Just so , ’
353583	353629	353581	353581	Physician	630	‘ But whether it is all true , or partly true , or entirely false , I am wholly unable to say . It is a most provoking situation , a most absurd situation ; but you know Mr Merdle , and are not surprised . ’
353850	353867	353932	353932	He	630	‘ I come from the warm - baths , sir , round in the neighbouring street . ’
353868	353880	353932	353932	He	630	‘ And what is the matter at the warm - baths ? ’
353881	353900	353901	353901	He	630	‘ Would you please to come directly , sir . We found that , lying on the table . ’

354022	354036	354015	354016	the physician	11903	‘ and do you take me straight to the place , my friend , ’
354262	354279	354283	354284	the physician	11903	‘ Separation of jugular vein -- death rapid -- been dead at least half an hour . ’

354758	354769	354745	354745	he	479	‘ You asked me once what Merdle ’s complaint was . ’
354770	354779	354745	354745	he	479	‘ Extraordinary answer ! I know I did . ’
354780	354790	354745	354745	he	479	‘ I told you I had not found out . ’
354791	354799	354745	354745	he	479	‘ Yes . I know you did . ’

355297	355303	355285	355285	he	630	‘ Mr Merdle is dead . ’
355304	355309	355311	355313	the Chief Butler	11840	‘ I should wish , ’
355315	355323	355311	355313	the Chief Butler	11840	‘ to give a month ’s notice . ’
355324	355331	355285	355285	he	630	‘ Mr Merdle has destroyed himself . ’
355332	355335	355337	355339	the Chief Butler	11840	‘ Sir , ’
355341	355369	355337	355339	the Chief Butler	11840	‘ that is very unpleasant to the feelings of one in my position , as calculated to awaken prejudice ; and I should wish to leave immediately . ’
355370	355384	355386	355387	the Physician	11903	‘ If you are not shocked , are you not surprised , man ? ’
355405	355458	355391	355393	The Chief Butler	11840	‘ Sir , Mr Merdle never was the gentleman , and no ungentlemanly act on Mr Merdle ’s part would surprise me . Is there anybody else I can send to you , or any other directions I can give before I leave , respecting what you would wish to be done ? ’
355841	355859	355833	355833	Physician	630	‘ You must expect to go out , some day , like the snuff of a candle ; ’
355872	355880	355864	355865	Mr Merdle	273	‘ A man can die but once . ’
355915	355918	355833	355833	Physician	630	‘ Pressure . ’
356201	356263	356716	356719	the leveller of pride	8691	‘ Change , Pressure began to wane , and appalling whispers to circulate , east , west , north , and south . At first they were faint , and went no further than a doubt whether Mr Merdle ’s wealth would be found to be as vast as had been supposed ; whether there might not be a temporary difficulty in ‘

As the whispers became louder , which they did from that time every minute , they became more threatening . He had sprung from nothing , by no natural growth or process that any one could account for ; he had been , after all , a low , ignorant fellow ; he had been a down - looking man , and no one had ever been able to catch his eye ; he had been taken up by all sorts of people in quite an unaccountable manner ; he had never had any money of his own , his ventures had been utterly reckless , and his expenditure had been most enormous . In steady progression , as the day declined , the talk rose in sound and purpose . He had left a letter at the Baths addressed to his physician , and his physician had got the letter , and the letter would be produced at the Inquest on the morrow , and it would fall like a thunderbolt upon the multitude he had deluded . Numbers of men in every profession and trade would be blighted by his insolvency ; old people who had been in easy circumstances all their lives would have no place of repentance for their trust in him but the workhouse ; legions of women and children would have their whole future desolated by the hand of this mighty scoundrel . Every partaker of his magnificent feasts would be seen to have been a sharer in the plunder of innumerable homes ; every servile worshipper of riches who had helped to set him on his pedestal , would have done better to worship the Devil point - blank . So , the talk , lashed louder and higher by confirmation on confirmation , and by edition after edition of the evening papers , swelled into such a roar when night came , as might have brought one to believe that a solitary watcher on the gallery above the Dome of St Paul ’s would have perceived the night air to be laden with a heavy muttering of the name of Merdle , coupled with every form of execration . For by that time it was known that the late Mr Merdle ’s complaint had been simply Forgery and Robbery . He , the uncouth object of such wide - spread adulation , the sitter at great men ’s feasts , the roc ’s egg of great ladies ’

358635	358658	358665	358665	your	304	’ With these comforting remarks , Mr Rugg seated himself on an office - stool at the desk and proceeded to business . ‘

358730	358734	358735	358735	You	304	’ said Arthur . ‘

358847	358848	358849	358850	Mr Rugg	506	’ ‘
358852	358887	358888	358888	you	933	’ said Clennam , nerving himself to go through with what he had resolved upon , and surprising that gentleman by appearing , in his despondency , to have a settled determination of purpose ; ‘
358961	358962	358943	358943	I	0	’ ‘
358967	358976	358979	358979	sir	933	’ answered Mr Rugg , shrugging his shoulders . ‘
359019	359502	359503	359503	I	0	’ Clennam then proceeded to state to Mr Rugg his fixed resolution . He told Mr Rugg that his partner was a man of great simplicity and integrity , and that in all he meant to do , he was guided above all things by a knowledge of his partner ’s character , and a respect for his feelings . He explained that his partner was then absent on an enterprise of importance , and that it particularly behoved himself publicly to accept the blame of what he had rashly done , and publicly to exonerate his partner from all participation in the responsibility of it , lest the successful conduct of that enterprise should be endangered by the slightest suspicion wrongly attaching to his partner ’s honour and credit in another country . He told Mr Rugg that to clear his partner morally , to the fullest extent , and publicly and unreservedly to declare that he , Arthur Clennam , of that Firm , had of his own sole act , and even expressly against his partner ’s caution , embarked its resources in the swindles that had lately perished , was the only real atonement within his power ; was a better atonement to the particular man than it would be to many men ; and was therefore the atonement he had first to make . With this view , his intention was to print a declaration to the foregoing effect , which he had already drawn up ; and , besides circulating it among all who had dealings with the House , to advertise it in the public papers . Concurrently with this measure ( the description of which cost Mr Rugg innumerable wry faces and great uneasiness in his limbs ) , he would address a letter to all the creditors , exonerating his partner in a solemn manner , informing them of the stoppage of the House until their pleasure could be known and his partner communicated with , and humbly submitting himself to their direction . If , through their consideration for his partner ’s innocence , the affairs could ever be got into such train as that the business could be profitably resumed , and its present downfall overcome , then his own share in it should revert to his partner , as the only reparation he could make to him in money value for the distress and loss he had unhappily brought upon him , and he himself , at as small a salary as he could live upon , would ask to be allowed to serve the business as a faithful clerk . Though Mr Rugg saw plainly there was no preventing this from being done , still the wryness of his face and the uneasiness of his limbs so sorely required the propitiation of a Protest , that he made one . ‘
359510	359514	359503	359503	I	0	’ said he , ‘
359536	359977	359978	359978	I	0	’ Mr Rugg then stated , not without prolixity , the heads of his protest . These were , in effect , because the whole town , or he might say the whole country , was in the first madness of the late discovery , and the resentment against the victims would be very strong : those who had not been deluded being certain to wax exceedingly wroth with them for not having been as wise as they were : and those who had been deluded being certain to find excuses and reasons for themselves , of which they were equally certain to see that other sufferers were wholly devoid : not to mention the great probability of every individual sufferer persuading himself , to his violent indignation , that but for the example of all the other sufferers he never would have put himself in the way of suffering . Because such a declaration as Clennam ’s , made at such a time , would certainly draw down upon him a storm of animosity , rendering it impossible to calculate on forbearance in the creditors , or on unanimity among them ; and exposing him a solitary target to a straggling cross - fire , which might bring him down from half - a - dozen quarters at once . To all this Clennam merely replied that , granting the whole protest , nothing in it lessened the force , or could lessen the force , of the voluntary and public exoneration of his partner . He therefore , once and for all , requested Mr Rugg ’s immediate aid in getting the business despatched . Upon that , Mr Rugg fell to work ; and Arthur , retaining no property to himself but his clothes and books , and a little loose money , placed his small private banker’s - account with the papers of the business . The disclosure was made , and the storm raged fearfully . Thousands of people were wildly staring about for somebody alive to heap reproaches on ; and this notable case , courting publicity , set the living somebody so much wanted , on a scaffold . When people who had nothing to do with the case were so sensible of its flagrancy , people who lost money by it could scarcely be expected to deal mildly with it . Letters of reproach and invective showered in from the creditors ; and Mr Rugg , who sat upon the high stool every day and read them all , informed his client within a week that he feared there were writs out . ‘
359989	359993	359978	359978	I	0	’ said Clennam . ‘
360001	360048	360049	360049	I	0	’ On the very next morning , as he was turning in Bleeding Heart Yard by Mrs Plornish ’s corner , Mrs Plornish stood at the door waiting for him , and mysteriously besought him to step into Happy Cottage . There he found Mr Rugg . ‘

360127	360139	360115	360115	them	8740	’ said Mr Rugg , getting between him and the door , ‘

360308	360316	360305	360306	Mr Rugg	506	’ said Arthur , in his dejection , ‘

360347	360352	360345	360345	sir	933	’ cried Mr Rugg . ‘
360412	360427	360428	360428	I	0	’ Mr Rugg waved his right hand freely , as expressing abundance of space . ‘
360432	360436	360451	360451	you	933	’ said Clennam , ‘
360448	360449	360428	360428	I	0	’ ‘
360458	360463	360451	360451	you	933	’ returned Mr Rugg . ‘
360477	360558	360428	360428	I	0	’ He was a little offended at first , but he soon overlooked it . They walked through the Yard to the other end . The Bleeding Hearts were more interested in Arthur since his reverses than formerly ; now regarding him as one who was true to the place and had taken up his freedom . Many of them came out to look after him , and to observe to one another , with great unctuousness , that he was ‘
360564	360642	360428	360428	I	0	’ Mrs Plornish and her father stood at the top of the steps at their own end , much depressed and shaking their heads . There was nobody visibly in waiting when Arthur and Mr Rugg arrived at the Counting - house . But an elderly member of the Jewish persuasion , preserved in rum , followed them close , and looked in at the glass before Mr Rugg had opened one of the day ’s letters . ‘
360645	360653	360428	360428	I	0	’ said Mr Rugg , looking up . ‘
360675	360686	360669	360673	the gentleman I was mentioning	8754	’ This gentleman explained the object of his visit to be ‘
360693	360700	360669	360673	the gentleman I was mentioning	8754	’ and executed his legal function . ‘
360709	360719	360706	360707	Mr Clennam	304	’ asked Mr Rugg politely , rubbing his hands . ‘
360738	360782	360727	360727	you	304	’ Mr Rugg in a light airy way replied in the affirmative , and shook hands with him . He and his attendant then went down - stairs , got into the first conveyance they found , and drove to the old gates . ‘
360792	360798	360784	360784	I	0	’ said Clennam to himself , ‘
360806	360879	360880	360880	I	0	’ Mr Chivery was on the Lock , and Young John was in the Lodge : either newly released from it , or waiting to take his own spell of duty . Both were more astonished on seeing who the prisoner was , than one might have thought turnkeys would have been . The elder Mr Chivery shook hands with him in a shame - faced kind of way , and said , ‘
360899	361113	360890	360890	I	0	’ The younger Mr Chivery , more distant , did not shake hands with him at all ; he stood looking at him in a state of indecision so observable that it even came within the observation of Clennam with his heavy eyes and heavy heart . Presently afterwards , Young John disappeared into the jail . As Clennam knew enough of the place to know that he was required to remain in the Lodge a certain time , he took a seat in a corner , and feigned to be occupied with the perusal of letters from his pocket . They did not so engross his attention , but that he saw , with gratitude , how the elder Mr Chivery kept the Lodge clear of prisoners ; how he signed to some , with his keys , not to come in , how he nudged others with his elbows to go out , and how he made his misery as easy to him as he could . Arthur was sitting with his eyes fixed on the floor , recalling the past , brooding over the present , and not attending to either , when he felt himself touched upon the shoulder . It was by Young John ; and he said , ‘
361119	361151	361114	361114	You	8757	’ He got up and followed Young John . When they had gone a step or two within the inner iron - gate , Young John turned and said to him : ‘
361163	361164	361157	361157	I	0	’ ‘
361170	361220	361165	361165	I	0	’ Young John turned again , and took him in at the old doorway , up the old staircase , into the old room . Arthur stretched out his hand . Young John looked at it , looked at him -- sternly -- swelled , choked , and said : ‘
361253	361350	361238	361238	I	0	’ Surprise at this inconsistent behaviour yielded when he was gone ( he went away directly ) to the feelings which the empty room awakened in Clennam ’s wounded breast , and to the crowding associations with the one good and gentle creature who had sanctified it . Her absence in his altered fortunes made it , and him in it , so very desolate and so much in need of such a face of love and truth , that he turned against the wall to weep , sobbing out , as his heart relieved itself , ‘
361356	361674	361238	361238	I	0	’ CHAPTER 27 . The Pupil of the Marshalsea The day was sunny , and the Marshalsea , with the hot noon striking upon it , was unwontedly quiet . Arthur Clennam dropped into a solitary arm - chair , itself as faded as any debtor in the jail , and yielded himself to his thoughts . In the unnatural peace of having gone through the dreaded arrest , and got there,--the first change of feeling which the prison most commonly induced , and from which dangerous resting - place so many men had slipped down to the depths of degradation and disgrace by so many ways,--he could think of some passages in his life , almost as if he were removed from them into another state of existence . Taking into account where he was , the interest that had first brought him there when he had been free to keep away , and the gentle presence that was equally inseparable from the walls and bars about him and from the impalpable remembrances of his later life which no walls or bars could imprison , it was not remarkable that everything his memory turned upon should bring him round again to Little Dorrit . Yet it was remarkable to him ; not because of the fact itself , but because of the reminder it brought with it , how much the dear little creature had influenced his better resolutions . None of us clearly know to whom or to what we are indebted in this wise , until some marked stop in the whirling wheel of life brings the right perception with it . It comes with sickness , it comes with sorrow , it comes with the loss of the dearly loved , it is one of the most frequent uses of adversity . It came to Clennam in his adversity , strongly and tenderly . ‘
361682	361686	361676	361676	I	0	’ he thought , ‘
361898	361975	361894	361895	Little Dorrit	274	’ So always as he sat alone in the faded chair , thinking . Always , Little Dorrit . Until it seemed to him as if he met the reward of having wandered away from her , and suffered anything to pass between him and his remembrance of her virtues . His door was opened , and the head of the elder Chivery was put in a very little way , without being turned towards him . ‘

362090	362095	362085	362085	Your	304	’ said Mr Chivery , ‘

362240	362283	362234	362235	Mr Chivery	452	‘ it ’s no odds me coming in . Mr Clennam , do n’t you take no notice of my son ( if you ’ll be so good ) in case you find him cut up anyways difficult . My son has a ‘

362346	362352	362353	362353	he	452	‘ Here ’s your portmanteau , ’
362363	362381	362353	362353	he	452	‘ It ’s very kind of you . I am ashamed that you should have the trouble . ’
362400	362407	362409	362409	he	452	‘ Here ’s your black box : ’
362416	362436	362409	362409	he	452	‘ I am very sensible of this attention . I hope we may shake hands now , Mr John . ’
362470	362487	362464	362464	he	449	‘ I do n’t know as I can . No ; I find I ca n’t ! ’
362509	362517	362519	362519	Clennam	304	‘ Why are you angry with me , ’
362521	362553	362519	362519	Clennam	304	‘ and yet so ready to do me these kind services ? There must be some mistake between us . If I have done anything to occasion it I am sorry . ’
362554	362560	362562	362562	John	449	‘ No mistake , sir , ’
362581	362682	362683	362683	Arthur	304	‘ No mistake , sir , in the feelings with which my eyes behold you at the present moment ! If I was at all fairly equal to your weight , Mr Clennam -- which I am not ; and if you were n’t under a cloud -- which you are ; and if it was n’t against all rules of the Marshalsea -- which it is ; those feelings are such , that they would stimulate me , more to having it out with you in a Round on the present spot than to anything else I could name . ’
362699	362704	362705	362705	he	304	‘ Well , well ! ’
362708	362715	362705	362705	he	304	‘ A mistake , a mistake ! ’
362750	362756	362737	362737	his	449	‘ I beg your pardon ! ’
362757	362761	362766	362766	his	304	‘ Freely granted , ’
362774	362785	362766	362766	his	304	‘ Say no more . I am not worth it . ’
362786	362792	362794	362795	Young John	449	‘ This furniture , sir , ’
362805	362860	362794	362795	Young John	449	‘ belongs to me . I am in the habit of letting it out to parties without furniture , that have the room . It an’t much , but it ’s at your service . Free , I mean . I could not think of letting you have it on any other terms . You ’re
362867	362905	362794	362795	Young John	449	’ Arthur raised his head again to thank him , and to say he could not accept the favour . John was still turning his wrist , and still contending with himself in his former divided manner . ‘
362913	362917	362794	362795	Young John	449	’ said Arthur . ‘
362926	362937	362918	362918	I	0	’ returned Young John , suddenly turning loud and sharp . ‘
362943	362983	362989	362989	sir	933	’ Arthur looked at him again , in vain , for an explanation of his behaviour . After a while , Arthur turned away his head again . Young John said , presently afterwards , with the utmost mildness : ‘
363058	363077	363045	363046	Most individuals	8782	’ Arthur drew the little table nearer , rested his arm upon it , and kept it there . ‘
363087	363092	363079	363079	you	933	’ said Young John , ‘
363176	363177	363179	363179	she	349	’ ‘

363201	363215	363188	363188	you	0	’ returned Young John , after appearing to take a large invisible pill . ‘
363288	363311	363312	363312	He	8777	’ They were both silent for several minutes : except that Young John remarked , at about the middle of the pause , ‘
363320	363333	363312	363312	He	8777	’ It was again Young John who broke the silence by inquiring : ‘
363358	363359	363360	363360	I	0	’ ‘
363370	363374	363360	363360	I	0	’ returned Clennam . ‘
363382	363383	363360	363360	I	0	’ ‘
363396	363401	363388	363388	you	933	’ urged Young John . ‘
363438	363474	363437	363437	I	0	’m going to have tea in my own apartment . If it ’s not a liberty , please to come and take a cup . Or I can bring a tray here in two minutes . ’
363693	363704	363682	363683	Young John	449	‘ I see you recollect the room , Mr Clennam ? ’
363705	363715	363721	363722	Young John	449	‘ I recollect it well , Heaven bless her ! ’
364022	364029	364031	364032	Young John	449	‘ Try a little something green , ’
364090	364100	364102	364103	Young John	449	‘ Try a little more something green , sir , ’
364163	364191	364156	364156	Clennam	304	‘ It was very kind of you to think of putting this between the wires ; but I can not even get this down to - day . ’
364265	364269	364270	364270	he	449	‘ I wonder , ’
364283	364313	364270	364270	he	449	‘ that if it ’s not worth your while to take care of yourself for your own sake , it ’s not worth doing for some one else ’s . ’
364314	364317	364319	364319	Arthur	304	‘ Truly , ’
364328	364336	364319	364319	Arthur	304	‘ I do n’t know for whose . ’
364337	364341	364343	364343	John	449	‘ Mr Clennam , ’
364347	364428	364343	364343	John	449	‘ I am surprised that a gentleman who is capable of the straightforwardness that you are capable of , should be capable of the mean action of making me such an answer . Mr Clennam , I am surprised that a gentleman who is capable of having a heart of his own , should be capable of the heartlessness of treating mine in that way . I am astonished at it , sir . Really and truly I am astonished ! ’
364476	364485	364487	364487	John	449	‘ I had got over it , sir , ’
364489	364552	364487	364487	John	449	‘ I had conquered it , knowing that it _ must _ be conquered , and had come to the resolution to think no more about it . I should n’t have given my mind to it again , I hope , if to this prison you had not been brought , and in an hour unfortunate for me , this day ! ’
364569	364767	364769	364770	Young John	449	‘ When you first came upon me , sir , in the Lodge , this day , more as if a Upas tree had been made a capture of than a private defendant , such mingled streams of feelings broke loose again within me , that everything was for the first few minutes swept away before them , and I was going round and round in a vortex . I got out of it . I struggled , and got out of it . If it was the last word I had to speak , against that vortex with my utmost powers I strove , and out of it I came . I argued that if I had been rude , apologies was due , and those apologies without a question of demeaning , I did make . And now , when I ’ve been so wishful to show that one thought is next to being a holy one with me and goes before all others -- now , after all , you dodge me when I ever so gently hint at it , and throw me back upon myself . For , do not , sir , ’
364772	364795	364769	364770	Young John	449	‘ do not be so base as to deny that dodge you do , and thrown me back upon myself you have ! ’
364810	364822	364799	364799	Arthur	304	‘ What is it ? What do you mean , John ? ’
364859	364864	364865	364865	John	449	‘ I had n’t , ’
364868	364974	364865	364865	John	449	‘ no , I had n’t , and I never had the audaciousness to think , I am sure , that all was anything but lost . I had n’t , no , why should I say I had n’t if I ever had , any hope that it was possible to be so blest , not after the words that passed , not even if barriers insurmountable had not been raised ! But is that a reason why I am to have no memory , why I am to have no thoughts , why I am to have no sacred spots , nor anything ? ’
364975	364981	364983	364983	Arthur	304	‘ What can you mean ? ’
364985	364998	364999	364999	John	449	‘ It ’s all very well to trample on it , sir , ’
365011	365127	364999	364999	John	449	‘ if a person can make up his mind to be guilty of the action . It ’s all very well to trample on it , but it ’s there . It may be that it could n’t be trampled upon if it was n’t there . But that does n’t make it gentlemanly , that does n’t make it honourable , that does n’t justify throwing a person back upon himself after he has struggled and strived out of himself like a butterfly . The world may sneer at a turnkey , but he ’s a man -- when he is n’t a woman , which among female criminals he ’s expected to be . ’
365238	365246	365248	365248	Arthur	304	‘ It seems to me just possible , ’
365265	365276	365251	365251	he	304	‘ that you have made some reference to Miss Dorrit . ’
365277	365285	365287	365288	John Chivery	449	‘ It is just possible , sir , ’
365290	365336	365287	365288	John Chivery	449	‘ I do n’t understand it . I hope I may not be so unlucky as to make you think I mean to offend you again , for I never have meant to offend you yet , when I say I do n’t understand it . ’
365337	365340	365342	365343	Young John	449	‘ Sir , ’
365345	365380	365342	365343	Young John	449	‘ will you have the perfidy to deny that you know and long have known that I felt towards Miss Dorrit , call it not the presumption of love , but adoration and sacrifice ? ’
365381	365431	365287	365288	John Chivery	449	‘ Indeed , John , I will not have any perfidy if I know it ; why you should suspect me of it I am at a loss to think . Did you ever hear from Mrs Chivery , your mother , that I went to see her once ? ’
365432	365437	365439	365439	John	449	‘ No , sir , ’
365443	365451	365439	365439	John	449	‘ Never heard of such a thing . ’
365452	365462	365287	365288	John Chivery	449	‘ But I did . Can you imagine why ? ’
365463	365468	365470	365470	John	449	‘ No , sir , ’
365474	365481	365470	365470	John	449	‘ I ca n’t imagine why . ’
365482	365510	365287	365288	John Chivery	449	‘ I will tell you . I was solicitous to promote Miss Dorrit ’s happiness ; and if I could have supposed that Miss Dorrit returned your affection-- ’
365523	365610	365612	365612	John	694	‘ Miss Dorrit never did , sir . I wish to be honourable and true , so far as in my humble way I can , and I would scorn to pretend for a moment that she ever did , or that she ever led me to believe she did ; no , nor even that it was ever to be expected in any cool reason that she would or could . She was far above me in all respects at all times . As likewise , ’
365614	365623	365612	365612	John	694	‘ similarly was her gen - teel family . ’
365679	365685	365686	365686	he	694	‘ You speak , John , ’
365693	365698	365686	365686	he	694	‘ like a Man . ’
365699	365704	365706	365706	John	694	‘ Well , sir , ’
365715	365725	365706	365706	John	694	‘ then I wish you ’d do the same . ’
365748	365751	365753	365753	John	694	‘ Leastways , ’
365764	365837	365756	365756	his	694	‘ if too strong a remark , withdrawn ! But , why not , why not ? When I say to you , Mr Clennam , take care of yourself for some one else ’s sake , why not be open , though a turnkey ? Why did I get you the room which I knew you ’d like best ? Why did I carry up your things ? Not that I found ‘
365845	365881	365756	365756	his	694	‘ em on that accounts ; far from it . Why have I cultivated you in the manner I have done since the morning ? On the ground of your own merits ? No . They ’re

365929	365933	365927	365927	John	694	’ said Clennam , ‘
366006	366007	366001	366001	I	0	’ ‘
366013	366020	366003	366003	your	694	’ John repeated with returning scorn , ‘

366033	366037	366028	366028	I	0	’ returned Arthur , ‘
366087	366126	366085	366085	you	694	’ John ’s incredulous face slowly softened into a face of doubt . He rose , backed into the garret - window of the room , beckoned Arthur to come there , and stood looking at him thoughtfully . ‘
366141	366142	366136	366136	you	304	’ ‘
366147	366148	366149	366149	Lord	8817	’ ‘
366151	366167	366168	366168	He	304	’ said Young John , appealing with a gasp to the spikes on the wall . ‘
366173	366196	366197	366197	He	304	’ Clennam looked at the spikes , and looked at John ; and looked at the spikes , and looked at John . ‘
366206	366218	366219	366219	he	304	’ exclaimed Young John , surveying him in a doleful maze , ‘
366233	366234	366226	366226	you	304	’ ‘
366242	366243	366237	366237	I	0	’ ‘

366321	366325	366309	366309	she	349	’ said Clennam . ‘
366332	366333	366327	366328	Miss Dorrit	349	’ ‘

366341	366437	366438	366438	Me	0	’ said John . And touched him with the back of his hand upon the breast , and backed to his chair , and sat down on it with a pale face , holding the arms , and shaking his head at him . If he had dealt Clennam a heavy blow , instead of laying that light touch upon him , its effect could not have been to shake him more . He stood amazed ; his eyes looking at John ; his lips parted , and seeming now and then to form the word ‘
366440	366475	366476	366476	Me	0	’ without uttering it ; his hands dropped at his sides ; his whole appearance that of a man who has been awakened from sleep , and stupefied by intelligence beyond his full comprehension . ‘
366478	366485	366476	366476	Me	0	’ he at length said aloud . ‘
366488	366493	366494	366494	You	0	’ groaned Young John . ‘
366496	366510	366511	366511	Your	0	’ He did what he could to muster a smile , and returned , ‘

366526	366531	366533	366533	I	0	’ said Young John . ‘
366604	366709	366901	366901	Certainty!’--as	695	’ arrows could have done ! _ I _ mistaken on a point that almost sent me into my grave , as I sometimes wished it would , if the grave could only have been made compatible with the tobacco - business and father and mother ’s feelings ! I mistaken on a point that , even at the present moment , makes me take out my pocket - handkerchief like a great girl , as people say : though I am sure I do n’t know why a great girl should be a term of reproach , for every rightly constituted male mind loves ‘
366727	366897	366901	366901	Certainty!’--as	695	’ Still highly respectable at bottom , though absurd enough upon the surface , Young John took out his pocket - handkerchief with a genuine absence both of display and concealment , which is only to be seen in a man with a great deal of good in him , when he takes out his pocket - handkerchief for the purpose of wiping his eyes . Having dried them , and indulged in the harmless luxury of a sob and a sniff , he put it up again . The touch was still in its influence so like a blow that Arthur could not get many words together to close the subject with . He assured John Chivery when he had returned his handkerchief to his pocket , that he did all honour to his disinterestedness and to the fidelity of his remembrance of Miss Dorrit . As to the impression on his mind , of which he had just relieved it -- here John interposed , and said , ‘
367025	367029	367016	367016	she	8830	‘ not the old ‘
367034	367037	367038	367038	he	8827	‘ un , ’
367221	367228	367218	367218	her	8830	‘ No , No , No , ’
367626	367811	367814	367814	father	1100	’ as the world went round , which round it did rewolve undoubted , even the best of gentlemen must take his turn of standing with his ed upside down and all his air a flying the wrong way into what you might call Space . Wery well then . What Mr Plornish said was , wery well then . That gentleman ’s ed would come up - ards when his turn come , that gentleman ’s air would be a pleasure to look upon being all smooth again , and wery well then ! It has been already stated that Mrs Plornish , not being philosophical , wept . It further happened that Mrs Plornish , not being philosophical , was intelligible . It may have arisen out of her softened state of mind , out of her sex ’s wit , out of a woman ’s quick association of ideas , or out of a woman ’s no association of ideas , but it further happened somehow that Mrs Plornish ’s intelligibility displayed itself upon the very subject of Arthur ’s meditations . ‘
367824	367829	367814	367814	father	1100	’ said Mrs Plornish , ‘
367886	367908	367882	367882	I	0	’ While speaking , Mrs Plornish shook her head , and wiped her eyes , and looked retrospectively about the room . ‘
367914	367919	367911	367912	Mr Baptist	387	’ pursued Mrs Plornish , ‘
367988	368000	368002	368002	I	0	’ said Mrs Plornish , winding up in the Italian manner , ‘
368010	368043	368002	368002	I	0	’ Though not conceited , Mrs Plornish felt that she had turned this Tuscan sentence with peculiar elegance . Mr Plornish could not conceal his exultation in her accomplishments as a linguist . ‘
368053	368060	368046	368046	I	0	’ the good woman went on , ‘
368117	368128	368108	368109	Miss Dorrit	349	’ Arthur thought she looked at him with particular expression . ‘
368134	368139	368108	368109	Miss Dorrit	349	’ reiterated Mrs Plornish , ‘
368191	368242	368246	368247	Mrs Plornish	387	’ Mrs Plornish repeated those words--‘not to be doubted , that the sight of you -- in misfortune and trouble , would have been almost too much for her affectionate heart . There ’s nothing I can think of , that would have touched Miss Dorrit so bad as that . ’
368265	368268	368270	368270	she	387	‘ Yes ! ’
368272	368388	368389	368390	Mrs Plornish	387	‘ And it shows what notice father takes , though at his time of life , that he says to me this afternoon , which Happy Cottage knows I neither make it up nor any ways enlarge , “ Mary , it ’s much to be rejoiced in that Miss Dorrit is not on the spot to behold it . ” Those were father ’s words . Father ’s own words was , “ Much to be rejoiced in , Mary , that Miss Dorrit is not on the spot to behold it . ” I says to father then , I says to him , “ Father , you are right ! ” That , ’
368403	368426	368389	368390	Mrs Plornish	387	‘ is what passed betwixt father and me . And I tell you nothing but what did pass betwixt me and father . ’
368456	368462	368464	368465	Mr Plornish	358	‘ For , you see , ’
368469	368479	368464	368465	Mr Plornish	358	‘ I know what it is , old gal ; ’
369200	369221	369187	369187	He	304	‘ How do you do , Mr Clennam ? I hope I am not unwelcome in calling to see you . ’
369253	369264	369265	369265	he	623	‘ You are surprised to see me , Mr Clennam , ’
369276	369285	369265	369265	he	623	‘ I must confess to being much surprised . ’
369286	369293	369187	369187	He	304	‘ Not disagreeably , I hope ? ’
369294	369299	369265	369265	he	623	‘ By no means . ’
369300	369306	369308	369311	the engaging young Barnacle	623	‘ Thank you . Frankly , ’
369313	369356	369308	369311	the engaging young Barnacle	623	‘ I have been excessively sorry to hear that you were under the necessity of a temporary retirement here , and I hope ( of course as between two private gentlemen ) that our place has had nothing to do with it ? ’
369357	369361	369265	369265	he	623	‘ Your office ? ’
369362	369367	369265	369265	he	623	‘ Our Circumlocution place . ’
369368	369383	369308	369311	the engaging young Barnacle	623	‘ I can not charge any part of my reverses upon that remarkable establishment . ’
369384	369389	369391	369394	the vivacious young Barnacle	623	‘ Upon my life , ’
369396	369435	369391	369394	the vivacious young Barnacle	623	‘ I am heartily glad to know it . It is quite a relief to me to hear you say it . I should have so exceedingly regretted our place having had anything to do with your difficulties . ’
369448	369453	369455	369455	Ferdinand	623	‘ That ’s right , ’
369457	369526	369455	369455	Ferdinand	623	‘ I am very happy to hear it . I was rather afraid in my own mind that we might have helped to floor you , because there is no doubt that it is our misfortune to do that kind of thing now and then . We do n’t want to do it ; but if men will be gravelled , why -- we ca n’t help it . ’
369527	369538	369540	369540	Arthur	304	‘ Without giving an unqualified assent to what you say , ’
369544	369557	369540	369540	Arthur	304	‘ I am much obliged to you for your interest in me . ’
369558	369568	369570	369573	the easy young Barnacle	623	‘ No , but really ! Our place is , ’
369575	369618	369570	369573	the easy young Barnacle	623	‘ the most inoffensive place possible . You ’ll say we are a humbug . I wo n’t say we are not ; but all that sort of thing is intended to be , and must be . Do n’t you see ? ’
369619	369624	369626	369626	Clennam	304	‘ I do not , ’
369628	369684	369626	369626	Clennam	304	‘ You do n’t regard it from the right point of view . It is the point of view that is the essential thing . Regard our place from the point of view that we only ask you to leave us alone , and we are as capital a Department as you ’ll find anywhere . ’
369685	369695	369697	369697	Clennam	304	‘ Is your place there to be left alone ? ’
369699	369705	369707	369707	Ferdinand	623	‘ You exactly hit it , ’
369709	369796	369707	369707	Ferdinand	623	‘ It is there with the express intention that everything shall be left alone . That is what it means . That is what it ’s for . No doubt there ’s a certain form to be kept up that it ’s for something else , but it ’s only a form . Why , good Heaven , we are nothing but forms ! Think what a lot of our forms you have gone through . And you have never got any nearer to an end ? ’
369797	369800	369802	369802	Clennam	304	‘ Never , ’
369804	369855	369802	369802	Clennam	304	‘ Look at it from the right point of view , and there you have us -- official and effectual . It ’s like a limited game of cricket . A field of outsiders are always going in to bowl at the Public Service , and we block the balls . ’
369899	369909	369910	369910	he	304	‘ And this occasions me to congratulate myself again , ’
369913	370032	369910	369910	he	304	‘ on the circumstance that our place has had nothing to do with your temporary retirement . It very easily might have had a hand in it ; because it is undeniable that we are sometimes a most unlucky place , in our effects upon people who will not leave us alone . Mr Clennam , I am quite unreserved with you . As between yourself and myself , I know I may be . I was so , when I first saw you making the mistake of not leaving us alone ; because I perceived that you were inexperienced and sanguine , and had -- I hope you ’ll not object to my saying -- some simplicity ? ’
370033	370038	369864	369867	The airy young Barnacle	623	‘ Not at all . ’
370039	370120	369910	369910	he	304	‘ Some simplicity . Therefore I felt what a pity it was , and I went out of my way to hint to you ( which really was not official , but I never am official when I can help it ) something to the effect that if I were you , I would n’t bother myself . However , you did bother yourself , and you have since bothered yourself . Now , do n’t do it any more . ’
370121	370131	370133	370133	Clennam	304	‘ I am not likely to have the opportunity , ’
370135	370193	370195	370195	Ferdinand	623	‘ Oh yes , you are ! You ’ll leave here . Everybody leaves here . There are no ends of ways of leaving here . Now , do n’t come back to us . That entreaty is the second object of my call . Pray , do n’t come back to us . Upon my honour , ’
370204	370225	370195	370195	Ferdinand	623	‘ I shall be greatly vexed if you do n’t take warning by the past and keep away from us . ’
370226	370231	370233	370233	Clennam	304	‘ And the invention ? ’
370235	370240	370233	370233	Clennam	304	‘ My good fellow , ’
370244	370274	370233	370233	Clennam	304	‘ if you ’ll excuse the freedom of that form of address , nobody wants to know of the invention , and nobody cares twopence - halfpenny about it . ’
370275	370286	370195	370195	Ferdinand	623	‘ Nobody in the Office , that is to say ? ’
370287	370355	370362	370362	his	7173	‘ Nor out of it . Everybody is ready to dislike and ridicule any invention . You have no idea how many people want to be left alone . You have no idea how the Genius of the country ( overlook the Parliamentary nature of the phrase , and do n’t be bored by it ) tends to being left alone . Believe me , Mr Clennam , ’
370366	370403	370362	370362	his	7173	‘ our place is not a wicked Giant to be charged at full tilt ; but only a windmill showing you , as it grinds immense quantities of chaff , which way the country wind blows . ’
370404	370411	370413	370413	Clennam	304	‘ If I could believe that , ’
370415	370427	370413	370413	Clennam	304	‘ it would be a dismal prospect for all of us . ’
370428	370436	370438	370438	Ferdinand	623	‘ Oh ! Do n’t say so ! ’
370440	370484	370438	370438	Ferdinand	623	‘ It ’s all right . We must have humbug , we all like humbug , we could n’t get on without humbug . A little humbug , and a groove , and everything goes on admirably , if you leave it alone . ’
370549	370556	370557	370557	he	623	‘ Is it fair to ask , ’
370580	370598	370557	370557	he	623	‘ whether it is true that our late lamented Merdle is the cause of this passing inconvenience ? ’
370599	370612	370625	370626	Ferdinand Barnacle	623	‘ I am one of the many he has ruined . Yes . ’
370613	370623	370625	370626	Ferdinand Barnacle	623	‘ He must have been an exceedingly clever fellow , ’
370646	370654	370656	370656	Ferdinand	623	‘ A consummate rascal , of course , ’
370658	370697	370656	370656	Ferdinand	623	‘ but remarkably clever ! One can not help admiring the fellow . Must have been such a master of humbug . Knew people so well -- got over them so completely -- did so much with them ! ’
370711	370715	370717	370717	Arthur	304	‘ I hope , ’
370719	370741	370717	370717	Arthur	304	‘ that he and his dupes may be a warning to people not to have so much done with them again . ’
370742	370748	370750	370750	Ferdinand	623	‘ My dear Mr Clennam , ’
370754	370861	370863	370863	Ferdinand	623	‘ have you really such a verdant hope ? The next man who has as large a capacity and as genuine a taste for swindling , will succeed as well . Pardon me , but I think you really have no idea how the human bees will swarm to the beating of any old tin kettle ; in that fact lies the complete manual of governing them . When they can be got to believe that the kettle is made of the precious metals , in that fact lies the whole power of men like our late lamented . No doubt there are here and there , ’
370866	370953	370863	370863	Ferdinand	623	‘ exceptional cases , where people have been taken in for what appeared to them to be much better reasons ; and I need not go far to find such a case ; but they do n’t invalidate the rule . Good day ! I hope that when I have the pleasure of seeing you , next , this passing cloud will have given place to sunshine . Do n’t come a step beyond the door . I know the way out perfectly . Good day ! ’
371058	371069	371071	371072	Mr Rugg	506	‘ How do you do to - day , sir ? ’

371933	371997	371927	371927	I	0	’ So errant had the prisoner ’s attention already grown in solitude and dejection , and so accustomed had it become to commune with only one silent figure within the ever - frowning walls , that Clennam had to shake off a kind of stupor before he could look at Mr Rugg , recall the thread of his talk , and hurriedly say , ‘
372019	372034	372041	372041	sir	933	’ Mr Rugg , without concealing that he was nettled and mortified , replied : ‘

372448	372615	372616	372616	Salve	699	’ His leave he took accordingly , in dudgeon . The gentleman of military exterior had so imperfectly awakened Clennam ’s curiosity , in the existing state of his mind , that a half - forgetfulness of such a visitor ’s having been referred to , was already creeping over it as a part of the sombre veil which almost always dimmed it now , when a heavy footstep on the stairs aroused him . It appeared to ascend them , not very promptly or spontaneously , yet with a display of stride and clatter meant to be insulting . As it paused for a moment on the landing outside his door , he could not recall his association with the peculiarity of its sound , though he thought he had one . Only a moment was given him for consideration . His door was immediately swung open by a thump , and in the doorway stood the missing Blandois , the cause of many anxieties . ‘
372623	372627	372616	372616	Salve	699	’ said he . ‘
372639	372799	372800	372800	I	0	’ Before Arthur could speak to him in his indignant wonder , Cavalletto followed him into the room . Mr Pancks followed Cavalletto . Neither of the two had been there since its present occupant had had possession of it . Mr Pancks , breathing hard , sidled near the window , put his hat on the ground , stirred his hair up with both hands , and folded his arms , like a man who had come to a pause in a hard day ’s work . Mr Baptist , never taking his eyes from his dreaded chum of old , softly sat down on the floor with his back against the door and one of his ankles in each hand : resuming the attitude ( except that it was now expressive of unwinking watchfulness ) in which he had sat before the same man in the deeper shade of another prison , one hot morning at Marseilles . ‘
372811	372822	372824	372824	you	8956	’ said Monsieur Blandois , otherwise Lagnier , otherwise Rigaud , ‘
372836	372882	372883	372883	You	8956	’ Glancing round contemptuously at the bedstead , which was turned up by day , he leaned his back against it as a resting - place , without removing his hat from his head , and stood defiantly lounging with his hands in his pockets . ‘
372890	372894	372883	372883	You	8956	’ said Arthur . ‘
372922	372936	372938	372940	this noble gentleman	8961	’ Monsieur Rigaud , after frowning at him for a moment , laughed . ‘

372987	372995	372976	372977	Holy Blue	540	’ interposed Cavalletto , also addressing Arthur : ‘

373126	373158	373159	373159	I	0	’ said Cavalletto , thrice throwing out his left hand with all its fingers spread , and doing it so rapidly that the sense of sight could hardly follow the action , ‘
373175	373182	373183	373183	they	8971	’ repeating the same swift performance , ‘
373188	373197	373240	373241	some one	1350	’ At this significant Italian rest on the word ‘
373200	373220	373240	373241	some one	1350	’ his backhanded shake of his right forefinger came into play ; a very little , and very cautiously . ‘
373272	373280	373299	373299	they	8971	’ with another rest upon the word , ‘
373388	373418	373379	373379	He	8963	’ a very decided rest indeed , and a very vigorous play from side to side of the back - handed forefinger--‘he is also this man that you see . ’
373464	373470	373471	373471	he	8963	‘ Eh well , Signore ! ’
373480	373496	373471	373471	he	8963	‘ I waited for a good opportunity . I writed some words to Signor Panco , ’
373509	373579	373471	373471	he	8963	‘ to come and help . I showed him , Rigaud , at his window , to Signor Panco , who was often the spy in the day . I slept at night near the door of the house . At last we entered , only this to - day , and now you see him ! As he would not come up in presence of the illustrious Advocate , ’
373591	373607	373582	373583	Mr Baptist	387	‘ we waited down below there , together , and Signor Panco guarded the street . ’
373693	373698	373700	373700	Rigaud	279	‘ Now , Philosopher ! ’
373702	373710	373700	373700	Rigaud	279	‘ What do you want with me ? ’
373711	373717	373719	373719	Arthur	304	‘ I want to know , ’
373726	373741	373719	373719	Arthur	304	‘ how you dare direct a suspicion of murder against my mother ’s house ? ’
373742	373745	373747	373747	Rigaud	279	‘ Dare ! ’
373749	373777	373747	373747	Rigaud	279	‘ Ho , ho ! Hear him ! Dare ? Is it dare ? By Heaven , my small boy , but you are a little imprudent ! ’
373778	373788	373790	373790	Arthur	304	‘ I want that suspicion to be cleared away , ’
373792	373883	373790	373790	Arthur	304	‘ You shall be taken there , and be publicly seen . I want to know , moreover , what business you had there when I had a burning desire to fling you down - stairs . Do n’t frown at me , man ! I have seen enough of you to know that you are a bully and coward . I need no revival of my spirits from the effects of this wretched place to tell you so plain a fact , and one that you know so well . ’
373896	373944	373889	373889	Rigaud	279	‘ By Heaven , my small boy , but you are a little compromising of my lady , your respectable mother’--and seemed for a minute undecided how to act . His indecision was soon gone . He sat himself down with a threatening swagger , and said : ‘
373986	373987	373991	373991	he	8983	’ ‘
373996	374006	373994	373994	Cavalletto	282	’ said Arthur , scornfully , producing the money . ‘
374010	374014	373994	373994	Cavalletto	282	’ added Rigaud , ‘
374028	374107	373994	373994	Cavalletto	282	’ The contraband beast , however , assuring all present , with his significant finger , that he peremptorily declined to leave his post at the door , Signor Panco offered his services . He soon returned with the bottle of wine : which , according to the custom of the place , originating in a scarcity of corkscrews among the Collegians ( in common with a scarcity of much else ) , was already opened for use . ‘
374114	374143	374174	374175	the Devil	10854	’ said Rigaud . Signor Panco put a tumbler before him ; not without a visible conflict of feeling on the question of throwing it at his head . ‘
374146	374150	374152	374153	a gentleman	9715	’ boasted Rigaud . ‘
374199	374222	374174	374175	the Devil	10854	’ He half filled the tumbler as he said it , and drank off the contents when he had done saying it . ‘

374734	374772	374773	374773	I	0	’ He threw out the lees of his glass on the ground , so that they nearly spattered Cavalletto . This seemed to draw his attention to him anew . He set down his glass and said : ‘
374797	374922	374792	374792	Cavalletto	282	’ The little man looked at Clennam , whose eyes were occupied with Rigaud , and , seeing no prohibition , got up from the ground , and poured out from the bottle into the glass . The blending , as he did so , of his old submission with a sense of something humorous ; the striving of that with a certain smouldering ferocity , which might have flashed fire in an instant ( as the born gentleman seemed to think , for he had a wary eye upon him ) ; and the easy yielding of all to a good - natured , careless , predominant propensity to sit down on the ground again : formed a very remarkable combination of character . ‘
374930	374936	374927	374928	brave sir	8991	’ Rigaud resumed after drinking , ‘
375093	375151	375090	375090	you	8991	’ Never had Clennam felt more acutely that he was a prisoner in bonds , than when he saw this man before him , and could not accompany him to his mother ’s house . All the undiscernible difficulties and dangers he had ever feared were closing in , when he could not stir hand or foot . ‘
375171	375190	375191	375191	you	8991	’ said Rigaud , pausing in his drink to look out of his glass with his horrible smile , ‘
375201	375202	375191	375191	you	8991	’ ‘
375208	375212	375191	375191	you	8991	’ said Clennam , ‘
375249	375250	375234	375234	they	9023	’ ‘
375259	375274	375234	375234	they	9023	’ said Rigaud , snapping his fingers again with an air of triumphant menace . ‘
375380	375416	375369	375369	Contrabandist	9031	’ Cavalletto got up again as before , and laid them before him in his former manner . Rigaud , after some villainous thinking and smiling , wrote , and read aloud , as follows : ‘
375421	375425	375418	375419	MRS CLENNAM	313	‘ Wait answer . ‘
375431	375439	375418	375419	MRS CLENNAM	313	‘ At the apartment of your son . ‘
375443	375488	375440	375441	Dear Madam	15411	‘ I am in despair to be informed to - day by our prisoner here ( who has had the goodness to employ spies to seek me , living for politic reasons in retirement ) , that you have had fears for my safety . ‘
375505	375585	375586	375586	I	0	‘ With the greatest impatience I should fly to your house , but that I foresee it to be possible , under the circumstances , that you will not yet have quite definitively arranged the little proposition I have had the honour to submit to you . I name one week from this day , for a last final visit on my part ; when you will unconditionally accept it or reject it , with its train of consequences . ‘
375616	375653	375656	375657	dear madam	15411	‘ In the meanwhile , it is not too much to propose ( our prisoner having deranged my housekeeping ) , that my expenses of lodging and nourishment at an hotel shall be paid by you . ‘
375669	375673	375662	375662	my	0	‘ RIGAUD BLANDOIS . ‘
375682	375690	375692	375692	he	0	‘ I kiss the hands of Madame F. ’
375712	375734	375698	375698	Rigaud	706	‘ Hola you ! Apropos of producing , let somebody produce that at its address , and produce the answer here . ’
375735	375738	375740	375740	Arthur	304	‘ Cavalletto , ’
375742	375751	375740	375740	Arthur	304	‘ Will you take this fellow ’s letter ? ’
375844	375871	375873	375873	Rigaud	706	‘ Touch me with a finger , touch me with an epithet , question my superiority as I sit here drinking my wine at my pleasure , ’
375875	375905	375873	375873	Rigaud	706	‘ and I follow the letter and cancel my week ’s grace . _ You _ wanted me ? You have got me ! How do you like me ? ’
375906	375910	375912	375912	Clennam	304	‘ You know , ’
375922	375935	375912	375912	Clennam	304	‘ that when I sought you , I was not a prisoner . ’
375936	375946	375948	375948	Rigaud	706	‘ To the Devil with you and your prison , ’
375980	375993	375953	375953	he	706	‘ I care for neither of you . Contrabandist ! A light . ’
376059	376064	376066	376066	Rigaud	706	‘ Hola , Pig ! ’
376084	376127	376128	376128	He	706	‘ What ! The infernal old jail was a respectable one to this . There was dignity in the bars and stones of that place . It was a prison for men . But this ? Bah ! A hospital for imbeciles ! ’
376194	376258	376189	376189	he	706	‘ One must pass the time in the madman ’s absence . One must talk . One ca n’t drink strong wine all day long , or I would have another bottle . She ’s handsome , sir . Though not exactly to my taste , still , by the Thunder and the Lightning ! handsome . I felicitate you on your admiration . ’
376259	376266	376268	376268	Clennam	304	‘ I neither know nor ask , ’
376270	376276	376268	376268	Clennam	304	‘ of whom you speak . ’
376277	376298	376189	376189	he	706	‘ Della bella Gowana , sir , as they say in Italy . Of the Gowan , the fair Gowan . ’
376299	376312	376189	376189	he	706	‘ Of whose husband you were the -- follower , I think ? ’
376313	376325	376268	376268	Clennam	304	‘ Sir ? Follower ? You are insolent . The friend . ’
376326	376334	376335	376335	Rigaud	706	‘ Do you sell all your friends ? ’
376368	376422	376354	376354	he	706	‘ I sell anything that commands a price . How do your lawyers live , your politicians , your intriguers , your men of the Exchange ? How do you live ? How do you come here ? Have you sold no friend ? Lady of mine ! I rather think , yes ! ’
376440	376445	376447	376447	Rigaud	706	‘ Effectively , sir , ’
376449	376490	376447	376447	Rigaud	706	‘ Society sells itself and sells me : and I sell Society . I perceive you have acquaintance with another lady . Also handsome . A strong spirit . Let us see . How do they call her ? Wade . ’
376507	376510	376511	376511	he	706	‘ Yes , ’
376515	376807	376511	376511	he	706	‘ that handsome lady and strong spirit addresses me in the street , and I am not insensible . I respond . That handsome lady and strong spirit does me the favour to remark , in full confidence , “ I have my curiosity , and I have my chagrins . You are not more than ordinarily honourable , perhaps ? ” I announce myself , “ Madame , a gentleman from the birth , and a gentleman to the death ; but _ not _ more than ordinarily honourable . I despise such a weak fantasy . ” Thereupon she is pleased to compliment . “ The difference between you and the rest is , ” she answers , “ that you say so . ” For she knows Society . I accept her congratulations with gallantry and politeness . Politeness and little gallantries are inseparable from my character . She then makes a proposition , which is , in effect , that she has seen us much together ; that it appears to her that I am for the passing time the cat of the house , the friend of the family ; that her curiosity and her chagrins awaken the fancy to be acquainted with their movements , to know the manner of their life , how the fair Gowana is beloved , how the fair Gowana is cherished , and so on . She is not rich , but offers such and such little recompenses for the little cares and derangements of such services ; and I graciously -- to do everything graciously is a part of my character -- consent to accept them . O yes ! So goes the world . It is the mode . ’
376882	376889	376890	376890	he	304	‘ Whoof ! The fair Gowana ! ’
376910	376966	376890	376890	he	304	‘ Charming , but imprudent ! For it was not well of the fair Gowana to make mysteries of letters from old lovers , in her bedchamber on the mountain , that her husband might not see them . No , no . That was not well . Whoof ! The Gowana was mistaken there . ’
376967	376972	376974	376974	Arthur	304	‘ I earnestly hope , ’
376977	376995	376974	376974	Arthur	304	‘ that Pancks may not be long gone , for this man ’s presence pollutes the room . ’
376996	377008	377010	377010	Rigaud	706	‘ Ah ! But he ’ll flourish here , and everywhere , ’
377022	377031	377010	377010	Rigaud	706	‘ He always has ; he always will ! ’
377067	377092	377051	377051	he	706	‘ Who passes by this road so late ? Compagnon de la Majolaine ! Who passes by this road so late ? Always gay ! ‘
377149	377150	377153	377156	the king ’s knights	9713	’ ‘
377157	377173	377153	377156	the king ’s knights	9713	‘ tis the flower , Compagnon de la Majolaine ! Of all the king ’s knights ‘
377181	377301	377153	377156	the king ’s knights	9713	’ Partly in his old habit of submission , partly because his not doing it might injure his benefactor , and partly because he would as soon do it as anything else , Cavalletto took up the Refrain this time . Rigaud laughed , and fell to smoking with his eyes shut . Possibly another quarter of an hour elapsed before Mr Pancks ’s step was heard upon the stairs , but the interval seemed to Clennam insupportably long . His step was attended by another step ; and when Cavalletto opened the door , he admitted Mr Pancks and Mr Flintwinch . The latter was no sooner visible , than Rigaud rushed at him and embraced him boisterously . ‘
377310	377333	377153	377156	the king ’s knights	9713	’ said Mr Flintwinch , as soon as he could disengage himself , which he struggled to do with very little ceremony . ‘
377346	377361	377339	377339	I	0	’ This was in reference to another menace of attention from his recovered friend . ‘
377388	377415	377369	377369	I	0	’ He was as imperturbable as ever , to all appearance , and nodded his head in a moralising way as he looked round the room . ‘
377425	377430	377369	377369	I	0	’ said Mr Flintwinch . ‘
377446	377477	377433	377433	you	304	’ If Arthur had patience , Rigaud had not . He took his little Flintwinch , with fierce playfulness , by the two lapels of his coat , and cried : ‘
377512	377513	377515	377515	you	304	’ ‘
377528	377533	377515	377515	you	304	’ returned Mr Flintwinch , ‘
377549	377575	377576	377576	I	0	’ He did so . It was in his mother ’s maimed writing , on a slip of paper , and contained only these words : ‘
377605	377643	377646	377647	Beau Flintwinch	712	’ Clennam read this twice , in silence , and then tore it to pieces . Rigaud in the meanwhile stepped into a chair , and sat himself on the back with his feet upon the seat . ‘
377649	377664	377646	377647	Beau Flintwinch	712	’ he said , when he had closely watched the note to its destruction , ‘
377671	377672	377673	377674	Mrs Clennam	313	’ ‘
377700	377713	377714	377714	She	313	’ Mr Flintwinch screwed this out of himself , unwillingly and rustily . ‘
377750	377769	377735	377735	she	313	’ Monsieur Rigaud , after indulging in a fit of laughter , descended from his throne , saying , ‘
377779	377795	377825	377825	I	0	’ But , there his eyes encountered Cavalletto , who was still at his post . ‘
377800	377804	377798	377798	Pig	708	’ he added , ‘
377855	377878	377840	377840	I	0	’ In answer to Cavalletto ’s look of inquiry , Clennam made him a sign to go ; but he added aloud , ‘
377886	377897	377899	377899	master	9678	’ Cavalletto replied with a very emphatic finger - negative . ’No
377922	377944	377916	377916	he	9059	’ Rigaud took no notice of either remark until he had lighted his last cigarette and was quite ready for walking . ‘
377949	377960	377916	377916	he	9059	’ he said then , looking round upon them all . ‘
378023	378041	378051	378051	he	9059	‘ Of all the king ’s knights he ’s the flower , And he ’s always gay ! ’
379529	379569	379516	379517	Little Dorrit	274	‘ O , my best friend ! Dear Mr Clennam , do n’t let me see you weep ! Unless you weep with pleasure to see me . I hope you do . Your own poor child come back ! ’
379617	379626	379612	379612	she	9092	‘ They never told me you were ill , ’
379706	379722	379703	379703	he	304	‘ Is it possible that you have come to me ? And in this dress ? ’
379723	379773	379703	379703	he	304	‘ I hoped you would like me better in this dress than any other . I have always kept it by me , to remind me : though I wanted no reminding . I am not alone , you see . I have brought an old friend with me . ’
379805	379893	379794	379794	her	9098	‘ It was only yesterday evening that I came to London with my brother . I sent round to Mrs Plornish almost as soon as we arrived , that I might hear of you and let you know I had come . Then I heard that you were here . Did you happen to think of me in the night ? I almost believe you must have thought of me a little . I thought of you so anxiously , and it appeared so long to morning . ’
379894	379900	379901	379901	he	9099	‘ I have thought of you-- ’
379915	379939	379908	379908	She	9100	‘ You have not spoken to me by my right name yet . You know what my right name always is with you . ’
379940	379965	379794	379794	her	9098	‘ I have thought of you , Little Dorrit , every day , every hour , every minute , since I have been here . ’
379966	379973	379974	379974	He	9099	‘ Have you ? Have you ? ’
380009	380134	379997	379997	He	9099	‘ I was here before the gates were opened , but I was afraid to come straight to you . I should have done you more harm than good , at first ; for the prison was so familiar and yet so strange , and it brought back so many remembrances of my poor father , and of you too , that at first it overpowered me . But we went to Mr Chivery before we came to the gate , and he brought us in , and got John ’s room for us -- my poor old room , you know -- and we waited there a little . I brought the flowers to the door , but you did n’t hear me . ’
380709	380740	380693	380693	He	9103	‘ Dear Mr Clennam , I must say something to you before I go . I have put it off from hour to hour , but I must say it . ’
380741	380758	380759	380759	She	9102	‘ I too , dear Little Dorrit . I have put off what I must say . ’
380784	380870	380762	380762	her	9102	‘ I am not going abroad again . My brother is , but I am not . He was always attached to me , and he is so grateful to me now -- so much too grateful , for it is only because I happened to be with him in his illness -- that he says I shall be free to stay where I like best , and to do what I like best . He only wishes me to be happy , he says . ’
380905	380972	380881	380881	She	9110	‘ You will understand , I dare say , without my telling you , that my brother has come home to find my dear father ’s will , and to take possession of his property . He says , if there is a will , he is sure I shall be left rich ; and if there is none , that he will make me so . ’
380991	381319	380979	380979	she	9110	‘ I have no use for money , I have no wish for it . It would be of no value at all to me but for your sake . I could not be rich , and you here . I must always be much worse than poor , with you distressed . Will you let me lend you all I have ? Will you let me give it you ? Will you let me show you that I have never forgotten , that I never can forget , your protection of me when this was my home ? Dear Mr Clennam , make me of all the world the happiest , by saying Yes ? Make me as happy as I can be in leaving you here , by saying nothing to - night , and letting me go away with the hope that you will think of it kindly ; and that for my sake -- not for yours , for mine , for nobody ’s but mine!--you will give me the greatest joy I can experience on earth , the joy of knowing that I have been serviceable to you , and that I have paid some little of the great debt of my affection and gratitude . I ca n’t say what I wish to say . I ca n’t visit you here where I have lived so long , I ca n’t think of you here where I have seen so much , and be as calm and comforting as I ought . My tears will make their way . I can not keep them back . But pray , pray , pray , do not turn from your Little Dorrit , now , in your affliction ! Pray , pray , pray , I beg you and implore you with all my grieving heart , my friend -- my dear!--take all I have , and make it a Blessing to me ! ’
381359	381428	381346	381346	he	9113	‘ No , darling Little Dorrit . No , my child . I must not hear of such a sacrifice . Liberty and hope would be so dear , bought at such a price , that I could never support their weight , never bear the reproach of possessing them . But with what ardent thankfulness and love I say this , I may call Heaven to witness ! ’
381429	381445	381346	381346	he	9113	‘ And yet you will not let me be faithful to you in your affliction ? ’
381446	381678	381679	381679	She	9114	‘ Say , dearest Little Dorrit , and yet I will try to be faithful to you . If , in the bygone days when this was your home and when this was your dress , I had understood myself ( I speak only of myself ) better , and had read the secrets of my own breast more distinctly ; if , through my reserve and self - mistrust , I had discerned a light that I see brightly now when it has passed far away , and my weak footsteps can never overtake it ; if I had then known , and told you that I loved and honoured you , not as the poor child I used to call you , but as a woman whose true hand would raise me high above myself and make me a far happier and better man ; if I had so used the opportunity there is no recalling -- as I wish I had , O I wish I had!--and if something had kept us apart then , when I was moderately thriving , and when you were poor ; I might have met your noble offer of your fortune , dearest girl , with other words than these , and still have blushed to touch it . But , as it is , I must never touch it , never ! ’
381703	381751	381752	381752	He	9115	‘ I am disgraced enough , my Little Dorrit . I must not descend so low as that , and carry you -- so dear , so generous , so good -- down with me . GOD bless you , GOD reward you ! It is past . ’
381767	381885	381752	381752	He	9115	‘ Always so much older , so much rougher , and so much less worthy , even what I was must be dismissed by both of us , and you must see me only as I am . I put this parting kiss upon your cheek , my child -- who might have been more near to me , who never could have been more dear -- a ruined man far removed from you , for ever separated from you , whose course is run while yours is but beginning . I have not the courage to ask to be forgotten by you in my humiliation ; but I ask to be remembered only as I am . ’
381912	381954	381897	381897	He	9118	‘ One other word , my Little Dorrit . A hard one to me , but it is a necessary one . The time when you and this prison had anything in common has long gone by . Do you understand ? ’
381955	381965	381966	381966	she	9119	‘ O ! you will never say to me , ’
381981	382000	381966	381966	she	9119	‘ that I am not to come back any more ! You will surely not desert me so ! ’
382001	382109	382110	382110	Maggy	358	‘ I would say it , if I could ; but I have not the courage quite to shut out this dear face , and abandon all hope of its return . But do not come soon , do not come often ! This is now a tainted place , and I well know the taint of it clings to me . You belong to much brighter and better scenes . You are not to look back here , my Little Dorrit ; you are to look away to very different and much happier paths . Again , GOD bless you in them ! GOD reward you ! ’
382123	382211	382110	382110	Maggy	358	‘ Oh get him into a hospital ; do get him into a hospital , Mother ! He ’ll never look like hisself again , if he an’t got into a hospital . And then the little woman as was always a spinning at her wheel , she can go to the cupboard with the Princess , and say , what do you keep the Chicking there for ? and then they can take it out and give it to him , and then all be happy ! ’
382391	382416	382385	382385	he	449	‘ It ’s against all rules , but I do n’t mind . I was determined to come through , and come to you . ’
382417	382423	382385	382385	he	449	‘ What is the matter ? ’
382424	382462	382385	382385	he	449	‘ Nothing ’s the matter , sir . I was waiting in the court - yard for Miss Dorrit when she came out . I thought you ’d like some one to see that she was safe . ’
382463	382477	382385	382385	he	449	‘ Thank you , thank you ! You took her home , John ? ’
382478	382524	382385	382385	he	449	‘ I saw her to her hotel . The same that Mr Dorrit was at . Miss Dorrit walked all the way , and talked to me so kind , it quite knocked me over . Why do you think she walked instead of riding ? ’
382525	382533	382385	382385	he	449	‘ I do n’t know , John . ’
382534	382603	382605	382606	John Chivery	449	‘ To talk about you . She said to me , “ John , you was always honourable , and if you ’ll promise me that you will take care of him , and never let him want for help and comfort when I am not there , my mind will be at rest so far . ” I promised her .

382680	382705	382670	382670	John	449	‘ “ that his Little Dorrit sent him her undying love . ” Now it ’s delivered . Have I been honourable , sir ? ’
382706	382711	382635	382635	John	449	‘ Very , very ! ’
382712	382725	382670	382670	John	449	‘ Will you tell Miss Dorrit I ’ve been honourable , sir ? ’
382726	382731	382670	382670	John	449	‘ I will indeed . ’
382732	382740	382742	382742	John	449	‘ There ’s my hand , sir , ’

383417	383456	383382	383382	she	9144	‘ Faith , they are friends of your son the prisoner . And what do they want here , is it ? Death , madame , I do n’t know . You will do well to ask them . ’
383457	383472	383474	383474	Pancks	396	‘ You know you told us at the door , not to go yet , ’
383476	383494	383496	383496	Rigaud	279	‘ And you know you told me at the door , you did n’t mean to go , ’
383498	383542	383496	383496	Rigaud	279	‘ In a word , madame , permit me to present two spies of the prisoner’s -- madmen , but spies . If you wish them to remain here during our little conversation , say the word . It is nothing to me . ’
383543	383553	383555	383556	Mrs Clennam	313	‘ Why should I wish them to remain here ? ’
383558	383567	383555	383556	Mrs Clennam	313	‘ What have I to do with them ? ’
383568	383574	383576	383576	Rigaud	279	‘ Then , dearest madame , ’
383593	383617	383576	383576	Rigaud	279	‘ you will do well to dismiss them . It is your affair . They are not my spies , not my rascals . ’
383618	383624	383626	383627	Mrs Clennam	313	‘ Hark ! You Pancks , ’
383636	383662	383630	383630	her	313	‘ you Casby ’s clerk ! Attend to your employer ’s business and your own . Go . And take that other man with you . ’
383663	383669	383576	383576	Rigaud	279	‘ Thank you , ma’am , ’
383674	383750	383752	383753	Mr Pancks	396	‘ I am glad to say I see no objection to our both retiring . We have done all we undertook to do for Mr Clennam . His constant anxiety has been ( and it grew worse upon him when he became a prisoner ) , that this agreeable gentleman should be brought back here to the place from which he slipped away . Here he is -- brought back . And I will say , ’
383755	383781	383752	383753	Mr Pancks	396	‘ to his ill - looking face , that in my opinion the world would be no worse for his slipping out of it altogether . ’
383782	383789	383791	383792	Mrs Clennam	313	‘ Your opinion is not asked , ’
383794	383797	383791	383792	Mrs Clennam	313	‘ Go . ’
383798	383812	383814	383814	Pancks	396	‘ I am sorry not to leave you in better company , ma’am , ’
383816	383838	383814	383814	Pancks	396	‘ and sorry , too , that Mr Clennam ca n’t be present . It ’s my fault , that is . ’
383839	383845	383846	383846	she	313	‘ You mean his own , ’
383849	383858	383860	383860	Pancks	396	‘ No , I mean mine , ma’am , ’
383862	383876	383860	383860	Pancks	396	‘ for it was my misfortune to lead him into a ruinous investment . ’
383892	383900	383902	383903	Mr Pancks	396	‘ Though I can prove by figures , ’
383910	383959	383902	383903	Mr Pancks	396	‘ that it ought to have been a good investment . I have gone over it since it failed , every day of my life , and it comes out -- regarded as a question of figures -- triumphant . The present is not a time or place , ’
383978	384023	383969	383969	his	396	‘ for entering upon the figures ; but the figures are not to be disputed . Mr Clennam ought to have been at this moment in his carriage and pair , and I ought to have been worth from three to five thousand pound . ’
384087	384090	384092	384093	Mr Pancks	396	‘ However , ’
384095	384119	384092	384093	Mr Pancks	396	‘ enough of that . Altro , old boy , you have seen the figures , and you know how they come out . ’
384162	384204	384206	384206	Jeremiah	314	‘ Oh ! it ’s you , is it ? I thought I remembered your face , but I was n’t certain till I saw your teeth . Ah ! yes , to be sure . It was this officious refugee , ’
384211	384241	384206	384206	Jeremiah	314	‘ who came knocking at the door on the night when Arthur and Chatterbox were here , and who asked me a whole Catechism of questions about Mr Blandois . ’
384242	384247	384248	384249	Mr Baptist	387	‘ It is true , ’
384253	384266	384248	384249	Mr Baptist	387	‘ And behold him , padrone ! I have found him consequentementally . ’
384267	384274	384276	384277	Mr Flintwinch	320	‘ I should n’t have objected , ’
384279	384288	384276	384277	Mr Flintwinch	320	‘ to your having broken your neck consequentementally . ’
384289	384293	384295	384296	Mr Pancks	396	‘ And now , ’
384318	384383	384385	384386	Mr Pancks	396	‘ I ’ve only one other word to say before I go . If Mr Clennam was here -- but unfortunately , though he has so far got the better of this fine gentleman as to return him to this place against his will , he is ill and in prison -- ill and in prison , poor fellow -- if he was here , ’
384407	384420	384400	384400	his	396	‘ he would say , “ Affery , tell your dreams ! ” ’
384517	384520	384522	384523	Mr Flintwinch	320	‘ Come ! ’
384564	384594	384556	384556	he	320	‘ Whatever has to be said among us had better be begun to be said without more loss of time.--So , Affery , my woman , take yourself away ! ’
384642	384711	384712	384713	Mr Flintwinch	320	‘ No , I wo n’t , Jeremiah -- no , I won’t -- no , I wo n’t ! I wo n’t go ! I ’ll stay here . I ’ll hear all I do n’t know , and say all I know . I will , at last , if I die for it . I will , I will , I will , I will ! ’
384780	384785	384867	384868	Mrs Clennam	313	‘ Such a dose ! ’
384789	384797	384799	384799	Affery	312	‘ Not a bit nearer , Jeremiah ! ’
384808	384862	384799	384799	Affery	312	‘ Do n’t come a bit nearer to me , or I ’ll rouse the neighbourhood ! I ’ll throw myself out of window . I ’ll scream Fire and Murder ! I ’ll wake the dead ! Stop where you are , or I ’ll make shrieks enough to wake the dead ! ’
384870	384873	384867	384868	Mrs Clennam	313	‘ Stop ! ’
384879	384903	384874	384874	Jeremiah	314	‘ It is closing in , Flintwinch . Let her alone . Affery , do you turn against me after these many years ? ’
384904	385115	384867	384868	Mrs Clennam	313	‘ I do , if it ’s turning against you to hear what I do n’t know , and say what I know . I have broke out now , and I ca n’t go back . I am determined to do it . I will do it , I will , I will , I will ! If that ’s turning against you , yes , I turn against both of you two clever ones . I told Arthur when he first come home to stand up against you . I told him it was no reason , because I was afeard of my life of you , that he should be . All manner of things have been a - going on since then , and I wo n’t be run up by Jeremiah , nor yet I wo n’t be dazed and scared , nor made a party to I do n’t know what , no more . I wo n’t , I wo n’t , I wo n’t ! I ’ll up for Arthur when he has nothing left , and is ill , and in prison , and ca n’t up for himself . I will , I will , I will , I will ! ’
385116	385127	385129	385130	Mrs Clennam	313	‘ How do you know , you heap of confusion , ’
385133	385149	385129	385130	Mrs Clennam	313	‘ that in doing what you are doing now , you are even serving Arthur ? ’
385150	385160	385162	385162	Affery	312	‘ I do n’t know nothing rightly about anything , ’
385164	385287	385288	385288	She	9159	‘ and if ever you said a true word in your life , it ’s when you call me a heap of confusion , for you two clever ones have done your most to make me such . You married me whether I liked it or not , and you ’ve led me , pretty well ever since , such a life of dreaming and frightening as never was known , and what do you expect me to be but a heap of confusion ? You wanted to make me such , and I am such ; but I wo n’t submit no longer ; no , I wo n’t , I wo n’t , I wo n’t , I wo n’t ! ’
385311	385334	385309	385309	Rigaud	279	‘ You see and hear this foolish creature . Do you object to such a piece of distraction remaining where she is ? ’
385335	385340	385341	385341	he	279	‘ I , madame , ’
385344	385355	385341	385341	he	279	‘ do I ? That ’s a question for you . ’
385356	385361	385362	385362	she	9159	‘ I do not , ’
385367	385383	385362	385362	she	9159	‘ There is little left to choose now . Flintwinch , it is closing in . ’
385490	385497	385473	385474	Mrs Clennam	313	‘ Madame , I am a gentleman-- ’
385498	385502	385503	385503	she	9851	‘ Of whom , ’
385510	385528	385503	385503	she	9851	‘ I have heard disparagement , in connection with a French jail and an accusation of murder . ’
385540	385653	385536	385536	his	279	‘ Perfectly . Exactly . Of a lady too ! What absurdity ! How incredible ! I had the honour of making a great success then ; I hope to have the honour of making a great success now . I kiss your hands . Madame , I am a gentleman ( I was going to observe ) , who when he says , “ I will definitely finish this or that affair at the present sitting , ” does definitely finish it . I announce to you that we are arrived at our last sitting on our little business . You do me the favour to follow , and to comprehend ? ’
385665	385668	385654	385654	She	9851	‘ Yes . ’
385669	385713	385536	385536	his	279	‘ Further , I am a gentleman to whom mere mercenary trade - bargains are unknown , but to whom money is always acceptable as the means of pursuing his pleasures . You do me the favour to follow , and to comprehend ? ’
385714	385726	385536	385536	his	279	‘ Scarcely necessary to ask , one would say . Yes . ’
385727	385806	385654	385654	She	9851	‘ Further , I am a gentleman of the softest and sweetest disposition , but who , if trifled with , becomes enraged . Noble natures under such circumstances become enraged . I possess a noble nature . When the lion is awakened -- that is to say , when I enrage -- the satisfaction of my animosity is as acceptable to me as money . You always do me the favour to follow , and to comprehend ? ’
385807	385810	385811	385811	she	9851	‘ Yes , ’
385819	385854	385811	385811	she	9851	‘ Do not let me derange you ; pray be tranquil . I have said we are now arrived at our last sitting . Allow me to recall the two sittings we have held . ’
385855	385861	385654	385654	She	9851	‘ It is not necessary . ’
385862	385867	385868	385868	he	9163	‘ Death , madame , ’
385872	385974	385975	385975	he	9163	‘ it ’s my fancy ! Besides , it clears the way . The first sitting was limited . I had the honour of making your acquaintance -- of presenting my letter ; I am a Knight of Industry , at your service , madame , but my polished manners had won me so much of success , as a master of languages , among your compatriots who are as stiff as their own starch is to one another , but are ready to relax to a foreign gentleman of polished manners -- and of observing one or two little things , ’
385983	386041	385975	385975	he	9163	‘ about this honourable house , to know which was necessary to assure me , and to convince me that I had the distinguished pleasure of making the acquaintance of the lady I sought . I achieved this . I gave my word of honour to our dear Flintwinch that I would return . I gracefully departed . ’
386085	386229	386235	386235	she	9166	‘ I say , gracefully departed , because it was graceful to retire without alarming a lady . To be morally graceful , not less than physically , is a part of the character of Rigaud Blandois . It was also politic , as leaving you with something overhanging you , to expect me again with a little anxiety on a day not named . But your slave is politic . By Heaven , madame , politic ! Let us return . On the day not named , I have again the honour to render myself at your house . I intimate that I have something to sell , which , if not bought , will compromise madame whom I highly esteem . I explain myself generally . I demand -- I think it was a thousand pounds . Will you correct me ? ’
386240	386250	386235	386235	she	9166	‘ You demanded as much as a thousand pounds . ’
386251	386379	386235	386235	she	9166	‘ I demand at present , Two . Such are the evils of delay . But to return once more . We are not accordant ; we differ on that occasion . I am playful ; playfulness is a part of my amiable character . Playfully , I become as one slain and hidden . For , it may alone be worth half the sum to madame , to be freed from the suspicions that my droll idea awakens . Accident and spies intermix themselves against my playfulness , and spoil the fruit , perhaps -- who knows ? only you and Flintwinch -- when it is just ripe . Thus , madame , I am here for the last time . Listen ! Definitely the last . ’
386414	386449	386403	386403	he	9167	‘ Bah ! Stop an instant ! Let us advance by steps . Here is my Hotel - note to be paid , according to contract . Five minutes hence we may be at daggers ’

386487	386518	386485	386485	Flintwinch	320	’ said Mrs Clennam . He spirted it into Mr Flintwinch ’s face when the old man advanced to take it , and held forth his hand , repeating noisily , ‘
386529	386587	386614	386614	madame	10848	’ Jeremiah picked the bill up , looked at the total with a bloodshot eye , took a small canvas bag from his pocket , and told the amount into his hand . Rigaud chinked the money , weighed it in his hand , threw it up a little way and caught it , chinked it again . ‘
386619	386649	386650	386650	I	0	’ He turned upon her suddenly with a menacing gesture of the weighted hand that clenched the money , as if he were going to strike her with it . ‘
386704	386705	386717	386717	her	10127	’ ‘
386708	386712	386714	386715	this lady	10127	’ cried Rigaud . ‘
386730	386731	386732	386732	I	0	’ ‘
386749	386750	386717	386717	her	10127	’ ‘
386774	386788	386768	386768	I	0	’ She was no quicker , and no slower , in her reply . ‘
386814	386834	386835	386835	I	0	’ Rigaud , with a loud laugh , drummed his heels against the table , and chinked his money . ‘
386844	386845	386841	386841	you	10848	’ ‘
386871	386872	386860	386860	I	0	’ ‘
386877	386882	386874	386875	the Devil	10854	’ he asked savagely . ‘
386892	386893	386874	386875	the Devil	10854	’ ‘
386997	387052	387053	387053	You	10848	’ He looked at her so hard with those eyes too near together that the sinister sight of each , crossing that of the other , seemed to make the bridge of his hooked nose crooked . After a long survey , he said , with the further setting off of his internal smile : ‘
387059	387060	387053	387053	You	10848	’ ‘
387067	387068	387069	387069	You	0	’ ‘
387088	387089	387084	387086	my little Flintwinch	9177	’ ‘
387139	387222	387123	387123	You	0	’ She did not shrink under his evil leer , or avoid it . He turned it upon her again , but she remained steady at the point to which she had fixed herself . He got off the table , placed a chair near the sofa , sat down in it , and leaned an arm upon the sofa close to her own , which he touched with his hand . Her face was ever frowning , attentive , and settled . ‘
387246	387262	387232	387232	I	0	’ said Rigaud , with a warning play of his lithe fingers on her arm . ‘
387276	387296	387271	387271	me	0	’ She suffered him to take her wrist in his hand . Holding it , he proceeded to say : ‘
387350	387382	387383	387383	I	0	’ There was a struggle in her maimed arm as she twisted it away , but there was none in her face . On his face there was his own smile . ‘
387492	387570	387483	387483	I	0	’ Leaning over the sofa , poised on two legs of his chair and his left elbow ; that hand often tapping her arm to beat his words home ; his legs crossed ; his right hand sometimes arranging his hair , sometimes smoothing his moustache , sometimes striking his nose , always threatening her whatever it did ; coarse , insolent , rapacious , cruel , and powerful , he pursued his narrative at his ease . ‘
387627	387659	387660	387660	Jeremiah	314	’ Mistress Affery , fixedly attentive in the window - seat , biting the rolled up end of her apron , and trembling from head to foot , here cried out , ‘
387774	387799	387766	387766	you	9206	’ As Mr Flintwinch shook his fist at her , and as Mrs Clennam gazed upon her , Rigaud kissed his hand to her . ‘
387814	387815	387807	387807	You	717	’ ‘
387825	387829	387816	387816	I	0	’ returned Affery . ‘
387855	387860	387862	387862	she	9851	‘ em as such ! ’
387897	387903	387905	387905	Rigaud	706	‘ Our beloved Madame Flintwinch , ’
387907	388065	387905	387905	Rigaud	706	‘ developing all of a sudden a fine susceptibility and spirituality , is right to a marvel . Yes . So runs the history . Monsieur , the uncle , commands the nephew to marry . Monsieur says to him in effect , “ My nephew , I introduce to you a lady of strong force of character , like myself -- a resolved lady , a stern lady , a lady who has a will that can break the weak to powder : a lady without pity , without love , implacable , revengeful , cold as the stone , but raging as the fire . ” Ah ! what fortitude ! Ah , what superiority of intellectual strength ! Truly , a proud and noble character that I describe in the supposed words of Monsieur , the uncle . Ha , ha , ha ! Death of my soul , I love the sweet lady ! ’
388090	388095	388097	388097	Rigaud	706	‘ Madame , madame , ’
388116	388135	388097	388097	Rigaud	706	‘ I perceive I interest you . I perceive I awaken your sympathy . Let us go on . ’
388173	388282	388283	388283	Jeremiah	314	‘ The nephew , being , as the lucid Madame Flintwinch has remarked , a poor devil who has had everything but his orphan life frightened and famished out of him -- the nephew abases his head , and makes response : “ My uncle , it is to you to command . Do as you will ! ” Monsieur , the uncle , does as he will . It is what he always does .

Mine were days of wholesome repression , punishment , and fear . The corruption of our hearts , the evil of our ways , the curse that is upon us , the terrors that surround us -- these were the themes of my childhood . They formed my character , and filled me with an abhorrence of evil - doers . When old Mr Gilbert Clennam proposed his orphan nephew to my father for my husband , my father impressed upon me that his bringing - up had been , like mine , one of severe restraint . He told me , that besides the discipline his spirit had undergone , he had lived in a starved house , where rioting and gaiety were unknown , and where every day was a day of toil and trial like the last . He told me that he had been a man in years long before his uncle had acknowledged him as one ; and that from his school - days to that hour , his uncle ’s roof has been a sanctuary to him from the contagion of the irreligious and dissolute . When , within a twelvemonth of our marriage , I found my husband , at that time when my father spoke of him , to have sinned against the Lord and outraged me by holding a guilty creature in my place , was I to doubt that it had been appointed to me to make the discovery , and that it was appointed to me to lay the hand of punishment upon that creature of perdition ? Was I to dismiss in a moment -- not my own wrongs -- what was I ! but all the rejection of sin , and all the war against it , in which I had been bred ? ’

But for that appointment there would have been no discovery . “ Do not forget . ” It spoke to me like a voice from an angry cloud . Do not forget the deadly sin , do not forget the appointed discovery , do not forget the appointed suffering . I did not forget . Was it my own wrong I remembered ? Mine ! I was but a servant and a minister . What power could I have over them , but that they were bound in the bonds of their sin , and delivered to me ! ’

When she pleaded to me her youth , and his wretched and hard life ( that was her phrase for the virtuous training he had belied ) , and the desecrated ceremony of marriage there had secretly been between them , and the terrors of want and shame that had overwhelmed them both when I was first appointed to be the instrument of their punishment , and the love ( for she said the word to me , down at my feet ) in which she had abandoned him and left him to me , was it _ my _ enemy that became my footstool , were they the words of my wrath that made her shrink and quiver !

You may , with your place of retreat unknown , then leave , if you please , uncontradicted by me , the lie that when you passed out of all knowledge but mine , you merited a good name . ” That was all .

She was then free to bear her load of guilt in secret , and to break her heart in secret ; and through such present misery ( light enough for her , I think ! ) to purchase her redemption from endless misery , if she could . If , in this , I punished her here , did I not open to her a way hereafter ? If she knew herself to be surrounded by insatiable vengeance and unquenchable fires , were they mine ?

I devoted myself to reclaim the otherwise predestined and lost boy ; to give him the reputation of an honest origin ; to bring him up in fear and trembling , and in a life of practical contrition for the sins that were heavy on his head before his entrance into this condemned world . Was that a cruelty ? Was I , too , not visited with consequences of the original offence in which I had no complicity ? Arthur ’s father and I lived no further apart , with half the globe between us , than when we were together in this house . He died , and sent this watch back to me , with its Do not forget . I do NOT forget , though I do not read it as he did . I read in it , that I was appointed to do these things .

395521	395654	395488	395488	Mistress	4809	’ and ran out of the room . They saw her , from the window , run wildly through the court - yard and out at the gateway . For a few moments they stood motionless . Affery was the first to move , and she , wringing her hands , pursued her mistress . Next , Jeremiah Flintwinch , slowly backing to the door , with one hand in a pocket , and the other rubbing his chin , twisted himself out in his reticent way , speechlessly . Rigaud , left alone , composed himself upon the window - seat of the open window , in the old Marseilles - jail attitude . He laid his cigarettes and fire - box ready to his hand , and fell to smoking . ‘
395748	396174	396177	396177	you	9297	’ In the hour of his triumph , his moustache went up and his nose came down , as he ogled a great beam over his head with particular satisfaction . CHAPTER 31 . Closed The sun had set , and the streets were dim in the dusty twilight , when the figure so long unused to them hurried on its way . In the immediate neighbourhood of the old house it attracted little attention , for there were only a few straggling people to notice it ; but , ascending from the river by the crooked ways that led to London Bridge , and passing into the great main road , it became surrounded by astonishment . Resolute and wild of look , rapid of foot and yet weak and uncertain , conspicuously dressed in its black garments and with its hurried head - covering , gaunt and of an unearthly paleness , it pressed forward , taking no more heed of the throng than a sleep - walker . More remarkable by being so removed from the crowd it was among than if it had been lifted on a pedestal to be seen , the figure attracted all eyes . Saunterers pricked up their attention to observe it ; busy people , crossing it , slackened their pace and turned their heads ; companions pausing and standing aside , whispered one another to look at this spectral woman who was coming by ; and the sweep of the figure as it passed seemed to create a vortex , drawing the most idle and most curious after it . Made giddy by the turbulent irruption of this multitude of staring faces into her cell of years , by the confusing sensation of being in the air , and the yet more confusing sensation of being afoot , by the unexpected changes in half - remembered objects , and the want of likeness between the controllable pictures her imagination had often drawn of the life from which she was secluded and the overwhelming rush of the reality , she held her way as if she were environed by distracting thoughts , rather than by external humanity and observation . But , having crossed the bridge and gone some distance straight onward , she remembered that she must ask for a direction ; and it was only then , when she stopped and turned to look about her for a promising place of inquiry , that she found herself surrounded by an eager glare of faces . ‘
396181	396206	396177	396177	you	9297	’ she asked , trembling . None of those who were nearest answered ; but from the outer ring there arose a shrill cry of ‘
396207	396209	396177	396177	you	9297	’Cause you ’re
396212	396213	396214	396214	I	0	’ ‘
396232	396240	396177	396177	you	9297	’ The shrill outer circle again retorted , ‘
396243	396254	396177	396177	you	9297	‘ ud show you was mad if nothing else did , ‘
396261	396290	396177	396177	you	9297	’ A short , mild , quiet - looking young man made his way through to her , as a whooping ensued on this reply , and said : ‘
396299	396310	396311	396311	She	9297	’m going on duty there . Come across with me . ’
396408	396413	396415	396419	the turnkey who admitted them	9306	‘ Why , John ! ’
396421	396426	396415	396419	the turnkey who admitted them	9306	‘ What is it ? ’
396427	396454	396531	396533	the young man	2596	‘ Nothing , father ; only this lady not knowing her way , and being badgered by the boys . Who did you want , ma’am ? ’
396455	396463	396464	396466	The young man	2596	‘ Miss Dorrit . Is she here ? ’
396471	396484	396464	396466	The young man	2596	‘ Yes , she is here . What might your name be ? ’
396485	396489	396531	396533	the young man	2596	‘ Mrs Clennam . ’
396490	396496	396498	396500	the young man	2596	‘ Mr Clennam ’s mother ? ’
396511	396524	396502	396502	She	2596	‘ Yes . She had better be told it is his mother . ’
396525	396529	396531	396533	the young man	2596	‘ You see , ’
396535	396584	396531	396533	the young man	2596	‘ the Marshal ’s family living in the country at present , the Marshal has given Miss Dorrit one of the rooms in his house to use when she likes . Do n’t you think you had better come up there , and let me bring Miss Dorrit ? ’
396753	396768	396747	396748	Little Dorrit	585	‘ Is it possible , Mrs Clennam , that you are so happily recovered as-- ’
396788	396807	396816	396816	she	2596	‘ This is not recovery ; it is not strength ; I do n’t know what it is . ’
396822	396851	396816	396816	she	2596	‘ You have a packet left with you which you were to give to Arthur , if it was not reclaimed before this place closed to - night . ’
396852	396855	396912	396912	she	2596	‘ Yes . ’
396856	396861	396862	396863	Little Dorrit	585	‘ I reclaim it . ’
396885	396894	396862	396863	Little Dorrit	585	‘ Have you any idea of its contents ? ’
396941	396944	396938	396939	Little Dorrit	585	‘ No . ’
396945	396949	396950	396951	Little Dorrit	585	‘ Read them . ’
397083	397094	397070	397070	she	2596	‘ You know , now , what I have done . ’
397095	397135	397137	397138	Little Dorrit	585	‘ I think so . I am afraid so ; though my mind is so hurried , and so sorry , and has so much to pity that it has not been able to follow all I have read , ’
397141	397162	397137	397138	Little Dorrit	585	‘ I will restore to you what I have withheld from you . Forgive me . Can you forgive me ? ’
397163	397199	397070	397070	she	2596	‘ I can , and Heaven knows I do ! Do not kiss my dress and kneel to me ; you are too old to kneel to me ; I forgive you freely without that . ’
397200	397208	397070	397070	she	2596	‘ I have more yet to ask . ’
397209	397215	397217	397218	Little Dorrit	585	‘ Not in that posture , ’
397220	397241	397217	397218	Little Dorrit	585	‘ It is unnatural to see your grey hair lower than mine . Pray rise ; let me help you . ’
397262	397366	397244	397244	she	9323	‘ The great petition that I make to you ( there is another which grows out of it ) , the great supplication that I address to your merciful and gentle heart , is , that you will not disclose this to Arthur until I am dead . If you think , when you have had time for consideration , that it can do him any good to know it while I am yet alive , then tell him . But you will not think that ; and in such case , will you promise me to spare me until I am dead ? ’
397367	397384	397244	397244	she	9323	‘ I am so sorry , and what I have read has so confused my thoughts , ’
397389	397418	397386	397387	Little Dorrit	585	‘ that I can scarcely give you a steady answer . If I should be quite sure that to be acquainted with it will do Mr Clennam no good-- ’
397419	397480	397244	397244	she	9323	‘ I know you are attached to him , and will make him the first consideration . It is right that he should be the first consideration . I ask that . But , having regarded him , and still finding that you may spare me for the little time I shall remain on earth , will you do it ? ’
397481	397485	397244	397244	she	9323	‘ I will . ’
397486	397491	397492	397492	She	9324	‘ GOD bless you ! ’
397549	397556	397557	397557	she	9324	‘ You will wonder , perhaps , ’
397564	397715	397557	397557	she	9324	‘ that I can better bear to be known to you whom I have wronged , than to the son of my enemy who wronged me.--For she did wrong me ! She not only sinned grievously against the Lord , but she wronged me . What Arthur ’s father was to me , she made him . From our marriage day I was his dread , and that she made me . I was the scourge of both , and that is referable to her . You love Arthur ( I can see the blush upon your face ; may it be the dawn of happier days to both of you ! ) , and you will have thought already that he is as merciful and kind as you , and why do I not trust myself to him as soon as to you . Have you not thought so ? ’
397716	397720	397722	397723	Little Dorrit	585	‘ No thought , ’
397725	397758	397722	397723	Little Dorrit	585	‘ can be quite a stranger to my heart , that springs out of the knowledge that Mr Clennam is always to be relied upon for being kind and generous and good . ’
397759	397920	397557	397557	she	9324	‘ I do not doubt it . Yet Arthur is , of the whole world , the one person from whom I would conceal this , while I am in it . I kept over him as a child , in the days of his first remembrance , my restraining and correcting hand . I was stern with him , knowing that the transgressions of the parents are visited on their offspring , and that there was an angry mark upon him at his birth . I have sat with him and his father , seeing the weakness of his father yearning to unbend to him ; and forcing it back , that the child might work out his release in bondage and hardship . I have seen him , with his mother ’s face , looking up at me in awe from his little books , and trying to soften me with his mother ’s ways that hardened me . ’
397944	398328	397932	397932	her	9325	‘ For his good . Not for the satisfaction of my injury . What was I , and what was the worth of that , before the curse of Heaven ! I have seen that child grow up ; not to be pious in a chosen way ( his mother ’s influence lay too heavy on him for that ) , but still to be just and upright , and to be submissive to me . He never loved me , as I once half - hoped he might -- so frail we are , and so do the corrupt affections of the flesh war with our trusts and tasks ; but he always respected me and ordered himself dutifully to me . He does to this hour . With an empty place in his heart that he has never known the meaning of , he has turned away from me and gone his separate road ; but even that he has done considerately and with deference . These have been his relations towards me . Yours have been of a much slighter kind , spread over a much shorter time . When you have sat at your needle in my room , you have been in fear of me , but you have supposed me to have been doing you a kindness ; you are better informed now , and know me to have done you an injury . Your misconstruction and misunderstanding of the cause in which , and the motives with which , I have worked out this work , is lighter to endure than his would be . I would not , for any worldly recompense I can imagine , have him in a moment , however blindly , throw me down from the station I have held before him all his life , and change me altogether into something he would cast out of his respect , and think detected and exposed . Let him do it , if it must be done , when I am not here to see it . Let me never feel , while I am still alive , that I die before his face , and utterly perish away from him , like one consumed by lightning and swallowed by an earthquake . ’
398366	398386	398363	398363	she	9327	‘ Even now , I see _ you _ shrink from me , as if I had been cruel . ’
398439	398444	398446	398447	Mrs Clennam	313	‘ I have done , ’
398449	398496	398446	398447	Mrs Clennam	313	‘ what it was given to me to do . I have set myself against evil ; not against good . I have been an instrument of severity against sin . Have not mere sinners like myself been commissioned to lay it low in all time ? ’
398497	398502	398504	398505	Little Dorrit	585	‘ In all time ? ’
398507	398572	398504	398505	Little Dorrit	585	‘ Even if my own wrong had prevailed with me , and my own vengeance had moved me , could I have found no justification ? None in the old days when the innocent perished with the guilty , a thousand to one ? When the wrath of the hater of the unrighteous was not slaked even in blood , and yet found favour ? ’
398573	398582	398584	398585	Little Dorrit	585	‘ O , Mrs Clennam , Mrs Clennam , ’
398587	398731	398584	398585	Little Dorrit	585	‘ angry feelings and unforgiving deeds are no comfort and no guide to you and me . My life has been passed in this poor prison , and my teaching has been very defective ; but let me implore you to remember later and better days . Be guided only by the healer of the sick , the raiser of the dead , the friend of all who were afflicted and forlorn , the patient Master who shed tears of compassion for our infirmities . We can not but be right if we put all the rest away , and do everything in remembrance of Him . There is no vengeance and no infliction of suffering in His life , I am sure . There can be no confusion in following Him , and seeking for no other footsteps , I am certain . ’
398808	398811	398813	398814	Mrs Clennam	313	‘ Hark ! ’
398817	398972	398813	398814	Mrs Clennam	313	‘ I said I had another petition . It is one that does not admit of delay . The man who brought you this packet and possesses these proofs , is now waiting at my house to be bought off . I can keep this from Arthur , only by buying him off . He asks a large sum ; more than I can get together to pay him without having time . He refuses to make any abatement , because his threat is , that if he fails with me , he will come to you . Will you return with me and show him that you already know it ? Will you return with me and try to prevail with him ? Will you come and help me with him ? Do not refuse what I ask in Arthur ’s name , though I dare not ask it for Arthur ’s sake ! ’
399300	399311	399313	399314	Mrs Clennam	313	‘ What was that ! Let us make haste in , ’
400007	400012	399992	399992	he	320	‘ Here I am ! ’
400219	400879	400202	400204	the clever one	9379	’ time , determined for her part that his taking himself off within that period with all he could get , was the final satisfactory sum and substance of his promised explanation ; but she held her peace , devoutly thankful to be quit of him . As it seemed reasonable to conclude that a man who had never been buried could not be unburied , the diggers gave him up when their task was done , and did not dig down for him into the depths of the earth . This was taken in ill part by a great many people , who persisted in believing that Flintwinch was lying somewhere among the London geological formation . Nor was their belief much shaken by repeated intelligence which came over in course of time , that an old man who wore the tie of his neckcloth under one ear , and who was very well known to be an Englishman , consorted with the Dutchmen on the quaint banks of the canals of the Hague and in the drinking - shops of Amsterdam , under the style and designation of Mynheer von Flyntevynge . CHAPTER 32 . Going Arthur continuing to lie very ill in the Marshalsea , and Mr Rugg descrying no break in the legal sky affording a hope of his enlargement , Mr Pancks suffered desperately from self - reproaches . If it had not been for those infallible figures which proved that Arthur , instead of pining in imprisonment , ought to be promenading in a carriage and pair , and that Mr Pancks , instead of being restricted to his clerkly wages , ought to have from three to five thousand pounds of his own at his immediate disposal , that unhappy arithmetician would probably have taken to his bed , and there have made one of the many obscure persons who turned their faces to the wall and died , as a last sacrifice to the late Mr Merdle ’s greatness . Solely supported by his unimpugnable calculations , Mr Pancks led an unhappy and restless life ; constantly carrying his figures about with him in his hat , and not only going over them himself on every possible occasion , but entreating every human being he could lay hold of to go over them with him , and observe what a clear case it was . Down in Bleeding Heart Yard there was scarcely an inhabitant of note to whom Mr Pancks had not imparted his demonstration , and , as figures are catching , a kind of cyphering measles broke out in that locality , under the influence of which the whole Yard was light - headed . The more restless Mr Pancks grew in his mind , the more impatient he became of the Patriarch . In their later conferences his snorting assumed an irritable sound which boded the Patriarch no good ; likewise , Mr Pancks had on several occasions looked harder at the Patriarchal bumps than was quite reconcilable with the fact of his not being a painter , or a peruke - maker in search of the living model . However , he steamed in and out of his little back Dock according as he was wanted or not wanted in the Patriarchal presence , and business had gone on in its customary course . Bleeding Heart Yard had been harrowed by Mr Pancks , and cropped by Mr Casby , at the regular seasons ; Mr Pancks had taken all the drudgery and all the dirt of the business as _ his _ share ; Mr Casby had taken all the profits , all the ethereal vapour , and all the moonshine , as his share ; and , in the form of words which that benevolent beamer generally employed on Saturday evenings , when he twirled his fat thumbs after striking the week ’s balance , ‘
400899	400967	400968	400969	Mr Pancks	396	’ The Dock of the Steam - Tug , Pancks , had a leaden roof , which , frying in the very hot sunshine , may have heated the vessel . Be that as it may , one glowing Saturday evening , on being hailed by the lumbering bottle - green ship , the Tug instantly came working out of the Dock in a highly heated condition . ‘
400971	400977	400968	400969	Mr Pancks	396	’ was the Patriarchal remark , ‘
400990	400991	400983	400983	you	396	’ ‘
400999	401181	400994	400994	you	396	’ was the short rejoinder . The Patriarchal state , always a state of calmness and composure , was so particularly serene that evening as to be provoking . Everybody else within the bills of mortality was hot ; but the Patriarch was perfectly cool . Everybody was thirsty , and the Patriarch was drinking . There was a fragrance of limes or lemons about him ; and he made a drink of golden sherry , which shone in a large tumbler as if he were drinking the evening sunshine . This was bad , but not the worst . The worst was , that with his big blue eyes , and his polished head , and his long white hair , and his bottle - green legs stretched out before him , terminating in his easy shoes easily crossed at the instep , he had a radiant appearance of having in his extensive benevolence made the drink for the human species , while he himself wanted nothing but his own milk of human kindness . Wherefore , Mr Pancks said , ‘
401189	401205	401184	401184	you	9385	’ and put his hair up with both hands , in a highly portentous manner . ‘
401286	401287	401292	401292	I	0	’ ‘
401294	401297	401299	401300	Mr Pancks	396	‘ em ? ’
401302	401310	401299	401300	Mr Pancks	396	‘ What else am I made for ? ’
401311	401351	401352	401353	The Patriarch	11047	‘ You are made for nothing else , Mr Pancks . You are made to do your duty , but you do n’t do your duty . You are paid to squeeze , and you must squeeze to pay . ’
401401	401414	401390	401390	he	11047	‘ Paid to squeeze , sir , and must squeeze to pay . ’
401415	401418	401420	401420	Pancks	396	‘ Oh , ’
401422	401426	401420	401420	Pancks	396	‘ Anything more ? ’
401427	401459	401390	401390	he	11047	‘ Yes , sir , yes , sir . Something more . You will please , Mr Pancks , to squeeze the Yard again , the first thing on Monday morning . ’
401460	401463	401465	401465	Pancks	396	‘ Oh ! ’
401467	401482	401465	401465	Pancks	396	‘ Ai n’t that too soon ? I squeezed it dry to - day . ’
401483	401498	401390	401390	he	11047	‘ Nonsense , sir . Not near the mark , not near the mark . ’
401499	401502	401504	401504	Pancks	396	‘ Oh ! ’
401520	401524	401504	401504	Pancks	396	‘ Anything more ? ’
401525	401615	401390	401390	he	11047	‘ Yes , sir , yes , sir , something more . I am not at all pleased , Mr Pancks , with my daughter ; not at all pleased . Besides calling much too often to inquire for Mrs Clennam , Mrs Clennam , who is not just now in circumstances that are by any means calculated to -- to be satisfactory to all parties , she goes , Mr Pancks , unless I am much deceived , to inquire for Mr Clennam in jail . In jail . ’
401616	401625	401627	401627	Pancks	396	‘ He ’s laid up , you know , ’
401629	401635	401627	401627	Pancks	396	‘ Perhaps it ’s kind . ’
401636	401684	401390	401390	he	11047	‘ Pooh , pooh , Mr Pancks . She has nothing to do with that , nothing to do with that . I ca n’t allow it . Let him pay his debts and come out , come out ; pay his debts , and come out . ’
401721	401746	401748	401749	the Patriarch	11047	‘ You will please to mention to my daughter , Mr Pancks , that I ca n’t allow it , ca n’t allow it , ’
401752	401755	401757	401757	Pancks	396	‘ Oh ! ’
401759	401767	401757	401757	Pancks	396	‘ You could n’t mention it yourself ? ’
401768	401782	401697	401697	he	396	‘ No , sir , no ; you are paid to mention it , ’
401797	401811	401783	401786	the blundering old booby	9398	‘ and you must mention it to pay , mention it to pay . ’
401812	401815	401817	401817	Pancks	396	‘ Oh ! ’
401819	401823	401817	401817	Pancks	396	‘ Anything more ? ’
401824	401885	401886	401887	Mr Pancks	396	‘ Yes , sir . It appears to me , Mr Pancks , that you yourself are too often and too much in that direction , that direction . I recommend you , Mr Pancks , to dismiss from your attention both your own losses and other people ’s losses , and to mind your business , mind your business . ’
401905	401908	401886	401887	Mr Pancks	396	‘ Oh ! ’
401942	401946	401929	401930	Mr Pancks	396	‘ Anything more ? ’
401947	401962	401964	401965	the Patriarch	11047	‘ Not at present , sir , not at present . I am going , ’
401978	402022	401964	401965	the Patriarch	11047	‘ to take a little stroll , a little stroll . Perhaps I shall find you here when I come back . If not , sir , duty , duty ; squeeze , squeeze , squeeze , on Monday ; squeeze on Monday ! ’
402101	402106	402107	402107	he	396	‘ I thought so , ’

402627	402636	402638	402638	Pancks	396	‘ I have discharged myself from your service , ’
402640	402651	402638	402638	Pancks	396	‘ that I may tell you what you are . You ’re
402698	402721	402722	402724	a philanthropic sneak	9424	’re a driver in disguise , a screwer by deputy , a wringer , and squeezer , and shaver by substitute . You ’re
402727	402732	402726	402726	You	9422	’re a shabby deceiver ! ’
402751	402772	402726	402726	You	9422	‘ Ask these good people who ’s the hard man here . They ’ll tell you Pancks , I believe . ’
402779	402782	402726	402726	You	9422	‘ Certainly , ’
402784	402787	402726	402726	You	9422	‘ Hear ! ’

402824	402873	402822	402822	Pancks	396	‘ If you want to see the man who would flay you alive -- here he is ! Do n’t look for him in me , at thirty shillings a week , but look for him in Casby , at I do n’t know how much a year ! ’
402874	402877	402726	402726	You	9422	‘ Good ! ’
402882	402887	402726	402726	You	9422	‘ Hear Mr Pancks ! ’
402888	402893	402895	402896	that gentleman	2147	‘ Hear Mr Pancks ? ’
402905	402953	402895	402896	that gentleman	2147	‘ Yes , I should think so ! It ’s almost time to hear Mr Pancks . Mr Pancks has come down into the Yard to - night on purpose that you should hear him . Pancks is only the Works ; but here ’s the Winder ! ’
402990	402996	402998	402998	Pancks	396	‘ Here ’s the Stop , ’
403000	403157	402998	402998	Pancks	396	‘ that sets the tune to be ground . And there is but one tune , and its name is Grind , Grind , Grind ! Here ’s the Proprietor , and here ’s his Grubber . Why , good people , when he comes smoothly spinning through the Yard to - night , like a slow - going benevolent Humming - Top , and when you come about him with your complaints of the Grubber , you do n’t know what a cheat the Proprietor is ! What do you think of his showing himself to - night , that I may have all the blame on Monday ? What do you think of his having had me over the coals this very evening , because I do n’t squeeze you enough ? What do you think of my being , at the present moment , under special orders to squeeze you dry on Monday ? ’
403166	403169	403180	403180	Pancks	396	‘ Shame ! ’
403171	403174	403180	403180	Pancks	396	‘ Shabby ! ’
403175	403178	403180	403180	Pancks	396	‘ Shabby ? ’
403182	403220	403180	403180	Pancks	396	‘ Yes , I should think so ! The lot that your Casby belongs to , is the shabbiest of all the lots . Setting their Grubbers on , at a wretched pittance , to do what they ’re

403424	403430	403433	403433	you	9432	’ and its politer materials , ‘
403436	403437	403433	403433	you	9432	’ ‘

Bargain and sale , bless you ! Fixed principles ! It ’s a mighty fine sign - post , is The Casby ’s Head , ’
403713	403743	403745	403746	Mr Pancks	396	‘ but the real name of the House is the Sham ’s Arms . Its motto is , Keep the Grubber always at it . Is any gentleman present , ’

403772	403778	403780	403781	Mr Pancks	396	‘ It ’s no matter , ’
403783	403928	403930	403931	Mr Pancks	396	‘ I merely wish to remark that the task this Proprietor has set me , has been never to leave off conjugating the Imperative Mood Present Tense of the verb To keep always at it . Keep thou always at it . Let him keep always at it . Keep we or do we keep always at it . Keep ye or do ye or you keep always at it . Let them keep always at it . Here is your benevolent Patriarch of a Casby , and there is his golden rule . He is uncommonly improving to look at , and I am not at all so . He is as sweet as honey , and I am as dull as ditch - water . He provides the pitch , and I handle it , and it sticks to me . Now , ’
403957	403999	403942	403942	he	396	‘ as I am not accustomed to speak in public , and as I have made a rather lengthy speech , all circumstances considered , I shall bring my observations to a close by requesting you to get out of this . ’

405592	405622	405566	405568	Poor Mr Meagles	288	‘ Good , Henry ! You are my Pet ’s husband ; you have displaced me , in the course of nature ; if you wish it , good ! ’

406178	406236	406175	406176	Mr Meagles	288	‘ the nearer I am likely to come to the papers , whether they turn up or no . Because it is only reasonable to conclude that he would deposit them somewhere where they would be safe from people over in England , and where they would yet be accessible to himself , do n’t you see ? ’
406341	406344	406346	406347	Mr Meagles	288	‘ Oho ! ’

406538	406548	406550	406551	Mr Meagles	288	‘ Why , the truth is , Miss Wade , ’
406565	406617	406619	406619	his	288	‘ it is possible that you may be able to throw a light upon a little something that is at present dark . Any unpleasant bygones between us are bygones , I hope . Ca n’t be helped now . You recollect my daughter ? Time changes so ! A mother ! ’
406647	406659	406660	406660	she	305	‘ That is not the subject you wished to enter on ? ’
406668	406673	406660	406660	she	305	‘ No , no , ’
406678	406687	406660	406660	she	305	‘ No . I thought your good nature might-- ’
406688	406694	406695	406695	she	305	‘ I thought you knew , ’
406702	406714	406695	406695	she	305	‘ that my good nature is not to be calculated upon ? ’

406726	406741	406723	406724	Mr Meagles	288	‘ you do yourself an injustice . However , to come to the point . ’
406758	406783	406784	406784	He	288	‘ I have heard from my friend Clennam , who , you will be sorry to hear , has been and still is very ill-- ’
406794	406828	406830	406831	Mr Meagles	288	‘ --that you had some knowledge of one Blandois , lately killed in London by a violent accident . Now , do n’t mistake me ! I know it was a slight knowledge , ’
406845	406867	406830	406831	Mr Meagles	288	‘ I am fully aware of that . It was a slight knowledge , I know . But the question is , ’
406877	406937	406868	406869	Mr Meagles	288	‘ did he , on his way to England last time , leave a box of papers , or a bundle of papers , or some papers or other in some receptacle or other -- any papers -- with you : begging you to allow him to leave them here for a short time , until he wanted them ? ’
406938	406943	406944	406944	she	305	‘ The question is ? ’
406947	406952	406944	406944	she	305	‘ Whose question is ? ’
406953	406956	406958	406959	Mr Meagles	288	‘ Mine , ’
406961	406983	406985	406986	Mr Meagles	288	‘ And not only mine but Clennam ’s question , and other people ’s question . Now , I am sure , ’
406995	407056	406985	406986	Mr Meagles	288	‘ that you ca n’t have any unkind feeling towards my daughter ; it ’s impossible . Well ! It ’s her question , too ; being one in which a particular friend of hers is nearly interested . So here I am , frankly to say that is the question , and to ask , Now , did he ? ’
407057	407062	407063	407063	she	305	‘ Upon my word , ’
407066	407100	407063	407063	she	305	‘ I seem to be a mark for everybody who knew anything of a man I once in my life hired , and paid , and dismissed , to aim their questions at ! ’
407101	407107	407109	407110	Mr Meagles	288	‘ Now , do n’t , ’
407112	407303	407109	407110	Mr Meagles	288	‘ do n’t ! Do n’t take offence , because it ’s the plainest question in the world , and might be asked of any one . The documents I refer to were not his own , were wrongfully obtained , might at some time or other be troublesome to an innocent person to have in keeping , and are sought by the people to whom they really belong . He passed through Calais going to London , and there were reasons why he should not take them with him then , why he should wish to be able to put his hand upon them readily , and why he should distrust leaving them with people of his own sort . Did he leave them here ? I declare if I knew how to avoid giving you offence , I would take any pains to do it . I put the question personally , but there ’s nothing personal in it . I might put it to any one ; I have put it already to many people . Did he leave them here ? Did he leave anything here ? ’
407304	407307	407063	407063	she	305	‘ No . ’
407308	407321	407109	407110	Mr Meagles	288	‘ Then unfortunately , Miss Wade , you know nothing about them ? ’
407322	407351	407357	407358	Mr Meagles	288	‘ I know nothing about them . I have now answered your unaccountable question . He did not leave them here , and I know nothing about them . ’
407352	407355	407357	407358	Mr Meagles	288	‘ There ! ’
407361	407386	407357	407358	Mr Meagles	288	‘ I am sorry for it ; that ’s over ; and I hope there is not much harm done.--Tattycoram well , Miss Wade ? ’
407387	407394	407357	407358	Mr Meagles	288	‘ Harriet well ? O yes ! ’
407395	407405	407407	407408	Mr Meagles	288	‘ I have put my foot in it again , ’
407413	407492	407493	407493	She	9541	‘ I ca n’t keep my foot out of it here , it seems . Perhaps , if I had thought twice about it , I might never have given her the jingling name . But , when one means to be good - natured and sportive with young people , one does n’t think twice . Her old friend leaves a kind word for her , Miss Wade , if you should think proper to deliver it . ’
407540	407548	407549	407549	He	288	‘ Beaten , Mother ; no effects ! ’
407782	407788	407790	407791	Mr Meagles	288	‘ Eh ? Good gracious ! ’
407793	407808	407790	407791	Mr Meagles	288	‘ this is not Miss Dorrit ! Why , Mother , look ! Tattycoram ! ’
407904	407921	407874	407874	Tattycoram	293	‘ Pardon , dear Master ; take me back , dear Mistress ; here it is ! ’
407922	407925	407927	407928	Mr Meagles	288	‘ Tatty ! ’
407930	407935	407937	407937	Tattycoram	293	‘ What you wanted ! ’
407939	407997	407937	407937	Tattycoram	293	‘ Here it is ! I was put in the next room not to see you . I heard you ask her about it , I heard her say she had n’t got it , I was there when he left it , and I took it at bedtime and brought it away . Here it is ! ’
407998	408004	408006	408007	Mr Meagles	288	‘ Why , my girl , ’
408014	408021	408006	408007	Mr Meagles	288	‘ how did you come over ? ’
408022	408098	407937	407937	Tattycoram	293	‘ I came in the boat with you . I was sitting wrapped up at the other end . When you took a coach at the wharf , I took another coach and followed you here . She never would have given it up after what you had said to her about its being wanted ; she would sooner have sunk it in the sea , or burnt it . But , here it is ! ’
408111	408116	408006	408007	Mr Meagles	288	‘ Here it is ! ’
408117	408197	408198	408198	Father	1100	‘ She never wanted it to be left , I must say that for her ; but he left it , and I knew well that after what you said , and after her denying it , she never would have given it up . But here it is ! Dear Master , dear Mistress , take me back again , and give me back the dear old name ! Let this intercede for me . Here it is ! ’
408221	408230	408232	408232	Tattycoram	293	‘ Oh ! I have been so wretched , ’
408238	408441	408443	408443	Tattycoram	293	‘ always so unhappy , and so repentant ! I was afraid of her from the first time I saw her . I knew she had got a power over me through understanding what was bad in me so well . It was a madness in me , and she could raise it whenever she liked . I used to think , when I got into that state , that people were all against me because of my first beginning ; and the kinder they were to me , the worse fault I found in them . I made it out that they triumphed above me , and that they wanted to make me envy them , when I know -- when I even knew then -- that they never thought of such a thing . And my beautiful young mistress not so happy as she ought to have been , and I gone away from her ! Such a brute and a wretch as she must think me ! But you ’ll say a word to her for me , and ask her to be as forgiving as you two are ? For I am not so bad as I was , ’
408445	408535	408537	408537	Tattycoram	293	‘ I am bad enough , but not so bad as I was , indeed . I have had Miss Wade before me all this time , as if it was my own self grown ripe -- turning everything the wrong way , and twisting all good into evil . I have had her before me all this time , finding no pleasure in anything but keeping me as miserable , suspicious , and tormenting as herself . Not that she had much to do , to do that , ’
408547	408631	408537	408537	Tattycoram	293	‘ for I was as bad as bad could be . I only mean to say , that , after what I have gone through , I hope I shall never be quite so bad again , and that I shall get better by very slow degrees . I ’ll try very hard . I wo n’t stop at five - and - twenty , sir , I ’ll count five - and - twenty hundred , five - and - twenty thousand ! ’
408733	408741	408743	408744	Mr Meagles	288	‘ Now , my dear Miss Dorrit , ’
408746	408782	408743	408744	Mr Meagles	288	‘ I am a man of business -- or at least was -- and I am going to take my measures promptly , in that character . Had I better see Arthur to - night ? ’
408783	408818	408883	408884	Mr Meagles	288	‘ I think not to - night . I will go to his room and ascertain how he is . But I think it will be better not to see him to - night . ’
408819	408830	408832	408833	Mr Meagles	288	‘ I am much of your opinion , my dear , ’
408835	408877	408832	408833	Mr Meagles	288	‘ and therefore I have not been any nearer to him than this dismal room . Then I shall probably not see him for some little time to come . But I ’ll explain what I mean when you come back . ’
408913	408926	408909	408909	He	288	‘ Tattycoram , come to me a moment , my good girl . ’
408934	409007	408927	408927	She	9565	‘ You see that young lady who was here just now -- that little , quiet , fragile figure passing along there , Tatty ? Look . The people stand out of the way to let her go by . The men -- see the poor , shabby fellows -- pull off their hats to her quite politely , and now she glides in at that doorway . See her , Tattycoram ? ’
409008	409013	408909	408909	He	288	‘ Yes , sir . ’
409014	409063	408909	408909	He	288	‘ I have heard tell , Tatty , that she was once regularly called the child of this place . She was born here , and lived here many years . I ca n’t breathe here . A doleful place to be born and bred in , Tattycoram ? ’
409064	409070	408927	408927	She	9565	‘ Yes indeed , sir ! ’
409071	409169	408909	408909	He	288	‘ If she had constantly thought of herself , and settled with herself that everybody visited this place upon her , turned it against her , and cast it at her , she would have led an irritable and probably an useless existence . Yet I have heard tell , Tattycoram , that her young life has been one of active resignation , goodness , and noble service . Shall I tell you what I consider those eyes of hers , that were here just now , to have always looked at , to get that expression ? ’
409170	409179	408927	408927	She	9565	‘ Yes , if you please , sir . ’
409180	409221	408909	408909	He	288	‘ Duty , Tattycoram . Begin it early , and do it well ; and there is no antecedent to it , in any origin or station , that will tell against us with the Almighty , or with ourselves . ’
409270	409273	409275	409276	Mr Meagles	288	‘ Good ! ’
409280	409325	409275	409276	Mr Meagles	288	‘ I have not a doubt that ’s best . I shall trust my remembrances then , my sweet nurse , in your hands , and I well know they could n’t be in better . I am off again to - morrow morning . ’
409335	409339	409341	409342	Mr Meagles	288	‘ My dear , ’
409344	409376	409341	409342	Mr Meagles	288	‘ I ca n’t live without breathing . This place has taken my breath away , and I shall never get it back again until Arthur is out of this place . ’
409377	409392	409275	409276	Mr Meagles	288	‘ How is that a reason for going off again to - morrow morning ? ’
409393	409398	409400	409401	Mr Meagles	288	‘ You shall understand , ’
409403	409536	409400	409401	Mr Meagles	288	‘ To - night we three will put up at a City Hotel . To - morrow morning , Mother and Tattycoram will go down to Twickenham , where Mrs Tickit , sitting attended by Dr Buchan in the parlour - window , will think them a couple of ghosts ; and I shall go abroad again for Doyce . We must have Dan here . Now , I tell you , my love , it ’s of no use writing and planning and conditionally speculating upon this and that and the other , at uncertain intervals and distances ; we must have Doyce here .

Go at once I must , it stands to reason ; because I ca n’t live without breathing freely ; and I ca n’t breathe freely until Arthur is out of this Marshalsea . I am stifled at the present moment , and have scarcely breath enough to say this much , and to carry this precious box down - stairs for you . ’
409701	409711	409713	409714	Mr Meagles	288	‘ I do n’t like that , my dear , ’
409716	409741	409742	409742	She	9577	‘ It goes against my feeling of what ’s right , that _ you _ should do homage to _ me_--at the Marshalsea Gate . ’
409751	409759	409761	409762	Mr Meagles	288	‘ You remind me of the days , ’
409799	410293	409794	409797	a very good family	9580	’ It was the only comfort he had in the loss of his daughter , and if he made the most of it , who could blame him ? CHAPTER 34 . Gone On a healthy autumn day , the Marshalsea prisoner , weak but otherwise restored , sat listening to a voice that read to him . On a healthy autumn day ; when the golden fields had been reaped and ploughed again , when the summer fruits had ripened and waned , when the green perspectives of hops had been laid low by the busy pickers , when the apples clustering in the orchards were russet , and the berries of the mountain ash were crimson among the yellowing foliage . Already in the woods , glimpses of the hardy winter that was coming were to be caught through unaccustomed openings among the boughs where the prospect shone defined and clear , free from the bloom of the drowsy summer weather , which had rested on it as the bloom lies on the plum . So , from the seashore the ocean was no longer to be seen lying asleep in the heat , but its thousand sparkling eyes were open , and its whole breadth was in joyful animation , from the cool sand on the beach to the little sails on the horizon , drifting away like autumn - tinted leaves that had drifted from the trees . Changeless and barren , looking ignorantly at all the seasons with its fixed , pinched face of poverty and care , the prison had not a touch of any of these beauties on it . Blossom what would , its bricks and bars bore uniformly the same dead crop . Yet Clennam , listening to the voice as it read to him , heard in it all that great Nature was doing , heard in it all the soothing songs she sings to man . At no Mother ’s knee but hers had he ever dwelt in his youth on hopeful promises , on playful fancies , on the harvests of tenderness and humility that lie hidden in the early - fostered seeds of the imagination ; on the oaks of retreat from blighting winds , that have the germs of their strong roots in nursery acorns . But , in the tones of the voice that read to him , there were memories of an old feeling of such things , and echoes of every merciful and loving whisper that had ever stolen to him in his life . When the voice stopped , he put his hand over his eyes , murmuring that the light was strong upon them . Little Dorrit put the book by , and presently arose quietly to shade the window . Maggy sat at her needlework in her old place . The light softened , Little Dorrit brought her chair closer to his side . ‘

410508	410516	410505	410505	I	0	’ said Little Dorrit , after hesitating , ‘
410528	410578	410518	410518	I	0	’ He might have released the little light hand after fervently kissing it again ; but that , with a very gentle lingering where it was , it seemed to court being retained . He took it in both of his , and it lay softly on his breast . ‘
410634	410635	410620	410620	You	7099	’ ‘
410662	410663	410660	410660	you	7099	’ ‘
410667	410680	410660	410660	you	7099	’ The hand he held crept up a little nearer his face . ‘

410768	410769	410760	410760	you	7099	’ ‘
410776	410817	410773	410774	Little Dorrit	585	’ As she looked at him silently , there was something in her affectionate face that he did not quite comprehend : something that could have broken into tears in a moment , and yet that was happy and proud . ‘
410878	410889	410890	410890	I	0	’ Arthur was more shocked than surprised to hear it . ‘
410900	410904	410890	410890	I	0	’ he said : ‘
410924	410925	410933	410933	I	0	’ ‘
410955	410956	410950	410950	My	0	’ ‘

410986	411019	410978	410978	you	7099	’ As Arthur looked at her inquiringly , with a new apprehension on him , she withdrew her hand , and laid her face down on the spot where it had rested . ‘
411081	411119	411071	411071	you	7099	’ Locked in his arms , held to his heart , with his manly tears upon her own cheek , she drew the slight hand round his neck , and clasped it in its fellow - hand . ‘
411299	411556	411560	411561	Miss Dorrit	394	’ Maggy had of course been staring from the first , and had of course been crying her eyes out long before this . Maggy was now so overjoyed that , after hugging her little mother with all her might , she went down - stairs like a clog - hornpipe to find somebody or other to whom to impart her gladness . Whom should Maggy meet but Flora and Mr F. ’s Aunt opportunely coming in ? And whom else , as a consequence of that meeting , should Little Dorrit find waiting for herself , when , a good two or three hours afterwards , she went out ? Flora ’s eyes were a little red , and she seemed rather out of spirits . Mr F. ’s Aunt was so stiffened that she had the appearance of being past bending by any means short of powerful mechanical pressure . Her bonnet was cocked up behind in a terrific manner ; and her stony reticule was as rigid as if it had been petrified by the Gorgon ’s head , and had got it at that moment inside . With these imposing attributes , Mr F. ’s Aunt , publicly seated on the steps of the Marshal ’s official residence , had been for the two or three hours in question a great boon to the younger inhabitants of the Borough , whose sallies of humour she had considerably flushed herself by resenting at the point of her umbrella , from time to time . ‘
411567	411571	411560	411561	Miss Dorrit	394	’ said Flora , ‘
411676	411744	411653	411653	I	0	’ Rightly interpreting this rather obscure speech , Little Dorrit returned that she was quite at Flora ’s disposition . Flora accordingly led the way across the road to the pie - shop in question : Mr F. ’s Aunt stalking across in the rear , and putting herself in the way of being run over , with a perseverance worthy of a better cause . When the ‘
411749	411810	411653	411653	I	0	’ which were to be a blind to the conversation , were set before them on three little tin platters , each kidney one ornamented with a hole at the top , into which the civil man poured hot gravy out of a spouted can as if he were feeding three lamps , Flora took out her pocket - handkerchief . ‘
411817	411821	411653	411653	I	0	’ she began , ‘
411999	412015	411992	411992	I	0	’ Little Dorrit took her hand , and thanked her for all her old kindness . ‘
412021	412031	411992	411992	I	0	’ returned Flora , giving her an honest kiss , ‘
412216	412234	412185	412185	they	9614	’ Flora really had tears in her eyes now , and they showed her to great advantage . ‘
412240	412244	412245	412245	I	0	’ said Flora , ‘
412435	412461	412465	412466	my dear	969	’ Without having been able closely to follow Mrs Finching through this labyrinth , Little Dorrit understood its purpose , and cordially accepted the trust . ‘
412468	412476	412465	412466	my dear	969	’ said Flora , with great enjoyment , ‘
412551	412611	412633	412635	the excellent woman	9621	’ Mr F. ’s Aunt , who had eaten her pie with great solemnity , and who had been elaborating some grievous scheme of injury in her mind since her first assumption of that public position on the Marshal ’s steps , took the present opportunity of addressing the following Sibyllic apostrophe to the relict of her late nephew . ‘
412623	412626	412627	412627	Flora	499	’ winder ! ’
412654	412665	412646	412649	Mr F. ’s Aunt	2757	‘ Bring him for’ard and I ’ll chuck him out o ’
412668	412718	412719	412719	he	304	’ Having reiterated this demand an immense number of times , with a sustained glare of defiance at Little Dorrit , Mr F. ’s Aunt folded her arms , and sat down in the corner of the pie - shop parlour ; steadfastly refusing to budge until such time as ‘
412720	412724	412633	412635	the excellent woman	9621	’ should have been ‘
412728	412776	412633	412635	the excellent woman	9621	’ and the chucking portion of his destiny accomplished . In this condition of things , Flora confided to Little Dorrit that she had not seen Mr F. ’s Aunt so full of life and character for weeks ; that she would find it necessary to remain there ‘
412780	413044	412633	412635	the excellent woman	9621	’ until the inexorable old lady could be softened ; and that she could manage her best alone . They parted , therefore , in the friendliest manner , and with the kindest feeling on both sides . Mr F. ’s Aunt holding out like a grim fortress , and Flora becoming in need of refreshment , a messenger was despatched to the hotel for the tumbler already glanced at , which was afterwards replenished . With the aid of its content , a newspaper , and some skimming of the cream of the pie - stock , Flora got through the remainder of the day in perfect good humour ; though occasionally embarrassed by the consequences of an idle rumour which circulated among the credulous infants of the neighbourhood , to the effect that an old lady had sold herself to the pie - shop to be made up , and was then sitting in the pie - shop parlour , declining to complete her contract . This attracted so many young persons of both sexes , and , when the shades of evening began to fall , occasioned so much interruption to the business , that the merchant became very pressing in his proposals that Mr F. ’s Aunt should be removed . A conveyance was accordingly brought to the door , which , by the joint efforts of the merchant and Flora , this remarkable woman was at last induced to enter ; though not without even then putting her head out of the window , and demanding to have him ‘
413047	413080	412633	412635	the excellent woman	9621	’ for the purpose originally mentioned . As she was observed at this time to direct baleful glances towards the Marshalsea , it has been supposed that this admirably consistent female intended by ‘
413083	413217	412633	412635	the excellent woman	9621	’ Arthur Clennam . This , however , is mere speculation ; who the person was , who , for the satisfaction of Mr F. ’s Aunt ’s mind , ought to have been brought forward and never was brought forward , will never be positively known . The autumn days went on , and Little Dorrit never came to the Marshalsea now and went away without seeing him . No , no , no . One morning , as Arthur listened for the light feet that every morning ascended winged to his heart , bringing the heavenly brightness of a new love into the room where the old love had wrought so hard and been so true ; one morning , as he listened , he heard her coming , not alone . ‘
413221	413230	413218	413219	Dear Arthur	493	’ said her delighted voice outside the door , ‘
413244	413259	412633	412635	the excellent woman	9621	’ He had thought from the tread there were two with her . He answered ‘
413262	413300	412633	412635	the excellent woman	9621	’ and she came in with Mr Meagles . Sun - browned and jolly Mr Meagles looked , and he opened his arms and folded Arthur in them , like a sun - browned and jolly father . ‘
413307	413318	413302	413302	I	0	’ said Mr Meagles , after a minute or so . ‘

413494	413498	413487	413487	Doyce	426	’ sighed Arthur . ‘
413510	413515	413517	413517	He	426	’ said Mr Meagles . ‘
413578	413601	413604	413605	that man	1924	‘ em , that man ’s off his legs ; but where they do want things done and find a man to do ‘

413637	413647	413649	413649	Arthur	493	‘ What a load you take from my mind ! ’
413651	413658	413649	413649	Arthur	493	‘ What happiness you give me ! ’
413659	413662	413664	413665	Mr Meagles	288	‘ Happiness ? ’
413667	413750	413664	413665	Mr Meagles	288	‘ Do n’t talk about happiness till you see Dan . I assure you Dan is directing works and executing labours over yonder , that it would make your hair stand on end to look at . He ’s no public offender , bless you , now ! He ’s medalled and ribboned , and starred and crossed , and I don’t - know - what all’d , like a born nobleman . But we must n’t talk about that over here . ’
413751	413755	413763	413764	Mr Meagles	288	‘ Why not ? ’
413756	413761	413763	413764	Mr Meagles	288	‘ Oh , egad ! ’
413772	413838	413840	413841	Mr Meagles	288	‘ he must hide all those things under lock and key when he comes over here . They wo n’t do over here . In that particular , Britannia is a Britannia in the Manger -- won’t give her children such distinctions herself , and wo n’t allow them to be seen when they are given by other countries . No , no , Dan ! ’
413848	413855	413844	413844	his	288	‘ That wo n’t do here ! ’
413856	413875	413877	413877	Arthur	493	‘ If you had brought me ( except for Doyce ’s sake ) twice what I have lost , ’
413879	413896	413877	413877	Arthur	493	‘ you would not have given me the pleasure that you give me in this news . ’
413897	413906	413908	413909	Mr Meagles	288	‘ Why , of course , of course , ’
413911	413969	413970	413970	em	9633	‘ Of course I know that , my good fellow , and therefore I come out with it in the first burst . Now , to go back , about catching Doyce . I caught Doyce . Ran against him among a lot of those dirty brown dogs in women ’s nightcaps a great deal too big for ‘
413986	414012	414020	414020	Arthur	493	‘ em ! Well ! He was coming straight to me , and I was going to him , and so we came back together . ’
414013	414018	414020	414020	Arthur	493	‘ Doyce in England ! ’
414022	414025	414027	414028	Mr Meagles	288	‘ There ! ’

The long and short of it is , Arthur , we have both been in England this fortnight . And if you go on to ask where Doyce is at the present moment , why , my plain answer is -- here he is ! And now I can breathe again at last ! ’
414150	414164	414166	414166	Doyce	374	‘ There are only three branches of my subject , my dear Clennam , ’

And the day ended , and the night ended , and the morning came , and Little Dorrit , simply dressed as usual and having no one with her but Maggy , came into the prison with the sunshine . The poor room was a happy room that morning . Where in the world was there a room so full of quiet joy ! ‘
414898	414902	414894	414894	My	0	’ said Arthur . ‘

415002	415018	415020	415020	you	5463	’ she answered , laughing with glistening eyes and standing on tiptoe to kiss him , ‘
415031	415070	415020	415020	you	5463	’ So they stood before the fire , waiting : Clennam with his arm about her waist , and the fire shining , as fire in that same place had often shone , in Little Dorrit ’s eyes . ‘
415077	415081	415020	415020	you	5463	’ said Arthur . ‘
415087	415092	415020	415020	you	5463	’ said Little Dorrit . ‘
415103	415116	415117	415117	You	5463	’ asked Arthur , as he held the paper over the flame . ‘
415133	415214	415117	415117	You	5463	’ answered Little Dorrit . So he said it , and the paper burned away . They passed very quietly along the yard ; for no one was there , though many heads were stealthily peeping from the windows . Only one face , familiar of old , was in the Lodge . When they had both accosted it , and spoken many kind words , Little Dorrit turned back one last time with her hand stretched out , saying , ‘
415232	415504	415222	415222	I	0	’ Then they went up the steps of the neighbouring Saint George ’s Church , and went up to the altar , where Daniel Doyce was waiting in his paternal character . And there was Little Dorrit ’s old friend who had given her the Burial Register for a pillow ; full of admiration that she should come back to them to be married , after all . And they were married with the sun shining on them through the painted figure of Our Saviour on the window . And they went into the very room where Little Dorrit had slumbered after her party , to sign the Marriage Register . And there , Mr Pancks , ( destined to be chief clerk to Doyce and Clennam , and afterwards partner in the house ) , sinking the Incendiary in the peaceful friend , looked in at the door to see it done , with Flora gallantly supported on one arm and Maggy on the other , and a back - ground of John Chivery and father and other turnkeys who had run round for the moment , deserting the parent Marshalsea for its happy child . Nor had Flora the least signs of seclusion upon her , notwithstanding her recent declaration ; but , on the contrary , was wonderfully smart , and enjoyed the ceremonies mightily , though in a fluttered way . Little Dorrit ’s old friend held the inkstand as she signed her name , and the clerk paused in taking off the good clergyman ’s surplice , and all the witnesses looked on with special interest . ‘
415510	415518	415566	415566	I	0	’ said Little Dorrit ’s old friend , ‘
