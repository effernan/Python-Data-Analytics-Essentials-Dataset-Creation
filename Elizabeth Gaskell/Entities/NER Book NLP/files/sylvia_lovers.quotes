Whatever else they were , they were brave and daring . They had law to back them , therefore their business was lawful . They were serving their king and country . They were using all their faculties , and that is always pleasant . There was plenty of scope for the glory and triumph of outwitting ; plenty of adventure in their life . It was a lawful and loyal employment , requiring sense , readiness , courage , and besides it called out that strange love of the chase inherent in every man . Fourteen or fifteen miles at sea lay the _ Aurora _ , good man - of - war ; and to her were conveyed the living cargoes of several tenders , which were stationed at likely places along the sea - coast . One , the _ Lively Lady _ , might be seen from the cliffs above Monkshaven , not so far away , but hidden by the angle of the high lands from the constant sight of the townspeople ; and there was always the Randyvow - house ( as the public - house with the navy blue - flag was called thereabouts ) for the crew of the _ Lively Lady _ to lounge about , and there to offer drink to unwary passers - by . At present this was all that the press - gang had done at Monkshaven . CHAPTER II HOME FROM GREENLAND One hot day , early in October of the year 1796 , two girls set off from their country homes to Monkshaven to sell their butter and eggs , for they were both farmers '
4488	4606	4486	4489	the farmers ' wives	5515	' wives and daughters treated it all as a matter of course , replying with a good deal of independent humour to the customer , who , once having discovered where good butter and fresh eggs were to be sold , came time after time to depreciate the articles she always ended in taking . There was leisure for all this kind of work in those days . Molly had tied a knot on her pink - spotted handkerchief for each of the various purchases she had to make ; dull but important articles needed for the week 's consumption at home ; if she forgot any one of them she knew she was sure of a good '
4608	4632	4486	4487	the farmers	792	' from her mother . The number of them made her pocket - handkerchief look like one of the nine - tails of a '
4635	4988	4997	4997	Sylvia	188	' but not a single thing was for herself , nor , indeed , for any one individual of her numerous family . There was neither much thought nor much money to spend for any but collective wants in the Corney family . It was different with Sylvia . She was going to choose her first cloak , not to have an old one of her mother 's , that had gone down through two sisters , dyed for the fourth time ( and Molly would have been glad had even this chance been hers ) , but to buy a bran - new duffle cloak all for herself , with not even an elder authority to curb her as to price , only Molly to give her admiring counsel , and as much sympathy as was consistent with a little patient envy of Sylvia 's happier circumstances . Every now and then they wandered off from the one grand subject of thought , but Sylvia , with unconscious art , soon brought the conversation round to the fresh consideration of the respective merits of gray and scarlet . These girls were walking bare - foot and carrying their shoes and stockings in their hands during the first part of their way ; but as they were drawing near Monkshaven they stopped , and turned aside along a foot - path that led from the main - road down to the banks of the Dee . There were great stones in the river about here , round which the waters gathered and eddied and formed deep pools . Molly sate down on the grassy bank to wash her feet ; but Sylvia , more active ( or perhaps lighter - hearted with the notion of the cloak in the distance ) , placed her basket on a gravelly bit of shore , and , giving a long spring , seated herself on a stone almost in the middle of the stream . Then she began dipping her little rosy toes in the cool rushing water and whisking them out with childish glee . '

A run they dared not make it ; and as it was , the rate at which they walked would have caused destruction among eggs less carefully packed . When the descent was ended , there was yet the long narrow street before them , bending and swerving from the straight line , as it followed the course of the river . The girls felt as if they should never come to the market - place , which was situated at the crossing of Bridge Street and High Street . There the old stone cross was raised by the monks long ago ; now worn and mutilated , no one esteemed it as a holy symbol , but only as the Butter Cross , where market - women clustered on Wednesday , and whence the town crier made all his proclamations of household sales , things lost or found , beginning with '

Of course the much frequented space surrounding the Butter Cross was the favourite centre for shops ; and on this day , a fine market day , just when good housewives begin to look over their winter store of blankets and flannels , and discover their needs betimes , these shops ought to have had plenty of customers . But they were empty and of even quieter aspect than their every - day wo nt . The three - legged creepie - stools that were hired out at a penny an hour to such market - women as came too late to find room on the steps were unoccupied ; knocked over here and there , as if people had passed by in haste . Molly took in all at a glance , and interpreted the signs , though she had no time to explain their meaning , and her consequent course of action , to Sylvia , but darted into a corner shop . '

Again , this was denied by those who averred that Coulson was no blood relation , and that if the Fosters had intended to do anything considerable for Hester , they would never have allowed her and her mother to live in such a sparing way , ekeing out their small income by having Coulson and Hepburn for lodgers . No ; John and Jeremiah would leave all their money to some hospital or to some charitable institution . But , of course , there was a reply to this ; when are there not many sides to an argument about a possibility concerning which no facts are known ? Part of the reply turned on this : the old gentlemen had , probably , some deep plan in their heads in permitting their cousin to take Coulson and Hepburn as lodgers , the one a kind of nephew , the other , though so young , the head man in the shop ; if either of them took a fancy to Hester , how agreeably matters could be arranged ! All this time Hester is patiently waiting to serve Sylvia , who is standing before her a little shy , a little perplexed and distracted , by the sight of so many pretty things . Hester was a tall young woman , sparely yet largely formed , of a grave aspect , which made her look older than she really was . Her thick brown hair was smoothly taken off her broad forehead , and put in a very orderly fashion , under her linen cap ; her face was a little square , and her complexion sallow , though the texture of her skin was fine . Her gray eyes were very pleasant , because they looked at you so honestly and kindly ; her mouth was slightly compressed , as most have it who are in the habit of restraining their feelings ; but when she spoke you did not perceive this , and her rare smile slowly breaking forth showed her white even teeth , and when accompanied , as it generally was , by a sudden uplifting of her soft eyes , it made her countenance very winning . She was dressed in stuff of sober colours , both in accordance with her own taste , and in unasked compliance with the religious customs of the Fosters ; but Hester herself was not a Friend . Sylvia , standing opposite , not looking at Hester , but gazing at the ribbons in the shop window , as if hardly conscious that any one awaited the expression of her wishes , was a great contrast ; ready to smile or to pout , or to show her feelings in any way , with a character as undeveloped as a child 's , affectionate , wilful , naughty , tiresome , charming , anything , in fact , at present that the chances of an hour called out . Hester thought her customer the prettiest creature ever seen , in the moment she had for admiration before Sylvia turned round and , recalled to herself , began,-- '
10850	10864	10891	10891	I	0	' Hester said nothing , but went to examine the shop - mark . '
10901	11029	10891	10891	I	0	' Hester silently replaced the ribbon and went in search of the duffle . While she was gone Sylvia was addressed by the very person she most wished to avoid , and whose absence she had rejoiced over on first entering the shop , her cousin Philip Hepburn . He was a serious - looking young man , tall , but with a slight stoop in his shoulders , brought on by his occupation . He had thick hair standing off from his forehead in a peculiar but not unpleasing manner ; a long face , with a slightly aquiline nose , dark eyes , and a long upper lip , which gave a disagreeable aspect to a face that might otherwise have been good - looking .

11056	11074	11105	11105	She	188	' Sylvia pursed up her red lips , and did not look at him as she replied , '

11262	11280	11292	11292	Sylvie	188	' said Philip , kicking the red duffle with his foot , and speaking to the lad . '
11294	11334	11350	11350	him	0	' He used the name he had had the cousin 's right to call her by since her childhood , without remembering her words on the subject not five minutes before ; but she did , and was vexed . '
11355	11495	11533	11533	I	0	' Hester looked up at both their countenances , a little wondering what was their position with regard to each other ; for this , then , was the beautiful little cousin about whom Philip had talked to her mother , as sadly spoilt , and shamefully ignorant ; a lovely little dunce , and so forth . Hester had pictured Sylvia Robson , somehow , as very different from what she was : younger , more stupid , not half so bright and charming ( for , though she was now both pouting and cross , it was evident that this was not her accustomed mood ) . Sylvia devoted her attention to the red cloth , pushing aside the gray . Philip Hepburn was vexed at his advice being slighted ; and yet he urged it afresh . '
11531	11532	11548	11548	Sylvia	188	' '
11534	11546	11571	11571	Hester	209	'm sorry you sell such good - for - nothing things , '

She had need pause in the market - place , the outlet of which was crammed up . Then she gave tongue for the first time in such a fearful shriek , you could hardly catch the words she said . '
13165	13449	13458	13458	you	1087	' Those were the last words Sylvia heard before her own hysterical burst of tears called every one 's attention to her . She had been very busy about household work in the morning , and much agitated by all she had seen and heard since coming into Monkshaven ; and so it ended in this . Molly and Hester took her through the shop into the parlour beyond -- John Foster 's parlour , for Jeremiah , the elder brother , lived in a house of his own on the other side of the water . It was a low , comfortable room , with great beams running across the ceiling , and papered with the same paper as the walls -- a piece of elegant luxury which took Molly 's fancy mightily ! This parlour looked out on the dark courtyard in which there grew two or three poplars , straining upwards to the light ; and through an open door between the backs of two houses could be seen a glimpse of the dancing , heaving river , with such ships or fishing cobles as happened to be moored in the waters above the bridge . They placed Sylvia on the broad , old - fashioned sofa , and gave her water to drink , and tried to still her sobbing and choking . They loosed her hat , and copiously splashed her face and clustering chestnut hair , till at length she came to herself ; restored , but dripping wet . She sate up and looked at them , smoothing back her tangled curls off her brow , as if to clear both her eyes and her intellect . '

14122	14152	14163	14166	the good old man	1100	' I had thought to convoy my cousin and the other young woman home , for the town is like to be rough , and it 's getting dark . '

14425	14494	14412	14412	he	191	' Now go with thy cousin and her friend . Hester is here , and old Hannah . I myself will take Hester home , if need be .

14498	15047	14412	14412	he	191	' With this , Mr. John knocked at the door of the parlour , and waited for permission to enter . With old - fashioned courtesy he told the two strangers how glad he was that his room had been of service to them ; that he would never have made so bold as to pass through it , if he had been aware how it was occupied . And then going to a corner cupboard , high up in the wall , he pulled a key out of his pocket and unlocked his little store of wine , and cake , and spirits ; and insisted that they should eat and drink while waiting for Philip , who was taking some last measures for the security of the shop during the night . Sylvia declined everything , with less courtesy than she ought to have shown to the offers of the hospitable old man . Molly took wine and cake , leaving a good half of both , according to the code of manners in that part of the country ; and also because Sylvia was continually urging her to make haste . For the latter disliked the idea of her cousin 's esteeming it necessary to accompany them home , and wanted to escape from him by setting off before he returned . But any such plans were frustrated by Philip 's coming back into the parlour , full of grave content , which brimmed over from his eyes , with the parcel of Sylvia 's obnoxious red duffle under his arm ; anticipating so keenly the pleasure awaiting him in the walk , that he was almost surprised by the gravity of his companions as they prepared for it . Sylvia was a little penitent for her rejection of Mr. John 's hospitality , now she found out how unavailing for its purpose such rejection had been , and tried to make up by a modest sweetness of farewell , which quite won his heart , and made him praise her up to Hester in a way to which she , observant of all , could not bring herself fully to respond . What business had the pretty little creature to reject kindly - meant hospitality in the pettish way she did , thought Hester . And , oh ! what business had she to be so ungrateful and to try and thwart Philip in his thoughtful wish of escorting them through the streets of the rough , riotous town ? What did it all mean ? CHAPTER IV PHILIP HEPBURN The coast on that part of the island to which this story refers is bordered by rocks and cliffs . The inland country immediately adjacent to the coast is level , flat , and bleak ; it is only where the long stretch of dyke - enclosed fields terminates abruptly in a sheer descent , and the stranger sees the ocean creeping up the sands far below him , that he is aware on how great an elevation he has been . Here and there , as I have said , a cleft in the level land ( thus running out into the sea in steep promontories ) occurs -- what they would call a '
15049	15113	14412	14412	he	191	' in the Isle of Wight ; but instead of the soft south wind stealing up the woody ravine , as it does there , the eastern breeze comes piping shrill and clear along these northern chasms , keeping the trees that venture to grow on the sides down to the mere height of scrubby brushwood . The descent to the shore through these '
15115	15732	15865	15865	her	220	' is in most cases very abrupt , too much so for a cartway , or even a bridle - path ; but people can pass up and down without difficulty , by the help of a few rude steps hewn here and there out of the rock . Sixty or seventy years ago ( not to speak of much later times ) the farmers who owned or hired the land which lay directly on the summit of these cliffs were smugglers to the extent of their power , only partially checked by the coast - guard distributed , at pretty nearly equal interspaces of eight miles , all along the north - eastern seaboard . Still sea - wrack was a good manure , and there was no law against carrying it up in great osier baskets for the purpose of tillage , and many a secret thing was lodged in hidden crevices in the rocks till the farmer sent trusty people down to the shore for a good supply of sand and seaweed for his land . One of the farms on the cliff had lately been taken by Sylvia 's father . He was a man who had roamed about a good deal -- been sailor , smuggler , horse - dealer , and farmer in turns ; a sort of fellow possessed by a spirit of adventure and love of change , which did him and his own family more harm than anybody else . He was just the kind of man that all his neighbours found fault with , and all his neighbours liked . Late in life ( for such an imprudent man as he , was one of a class who generally we d , trusting to chance and luck for the provision for a family ) , farmer Robson married a woman whose only want of practical wisdom consisted in taking him for a husband . She was Philip Hepburn 's aunt , and had had the charge of him until she married from her widowed brother 's house . He it was who had let her know when Haytersbank Farm had been to let ; esteeming it a likely piece of land for his uncle to settle down upon , after a somewhat unprosperous career of horse - dealing . The farmhouse lay in the shelter of a very slight green hollow scarcely scooped out of the pasture field by which it was surrounded ; the short crisp turf came creeping up to the very door and windows , without any attempt at a yard or garden , or any nearer enclosure of the buildings than the stone dyke that formed the boundary of the field itself . The buildings were long and low , in order to avoid the rough violence of the winds that swept over that wild , bleak spot , both in winter and summer . It was well for the inhabitants of that house that coal was extremely cheap ; otherwise a southerner might have imagined that they could never have survived the cutting of the bitter gales that piped all round , and seemed to seek out every crevice for admission into the house . But the interior was warm enough when once you had mounted the long bleak lane , full of round rough stones , enough to lame any horse unaccustomed to such roads , and had crossed the field by the little dry , hard footpath , which tacked about so as to keep from directly facing the prevailing wind . Mrs. Robson was a Cumberland woman , and as such , was a cleaner housewife than the farmers '

Another minute and the countenances of both parents imperceptibly and unconsciously relaxed into pleasure as Sylvia came in . She looked very rosy from the walk , and the October air , which began to be frosty in the evenings ; there was a little cloud over her face at first , but it was quickly dispersed as she met the loving eyes of home . Philip , who followed her , had an excited , but not altogether pleased look about him . He received a hearty greeting from Daniel , and a quiet one from his aunt . '

But instead of frankly and directly owning this , he tried to frame a formal little speech , which would soothe Daniel 's mortified vanity ; and , of course , it had the directly opposite effect . Daniel resented being treated like a child , and yet turned his back on Philip with all the wilfulness of one . Sylvia did not care for her cousin , but hated the discomfort of having her father displeased ; so she took up her tale of adventure , and told her father and mother of her afternoon 's proceedings . Daniel pretended not to listen at first , and made ostentatious noises with his spoon and glass ; but by - and - by he got quite warm and excited about the doings of the press - gang , and scolded both Philip and Sylvia for not having learnt more particulars as to what was the termination of the riot .

Sylvia , too , was in no way annoyed ; not only with her father , but with every man whom she knew , excepting her cousin Philip , was it a matter of course to drink till their ideas became confused . So she simply put her wheel aside , as preparatory to going to bed , when her mother said , in a more decided tone than that which she had used on any other occasion but this , and similar ones-- '

20213	20492	20748	20750	th ' feyther	5890	' He had to shout out the last after Philip , for Hepburn , really anxious to please his aunt , and disliking drinking habits himself by constitution , was already at the door , and setting out on his return home , thinking , it must be confessed , far more of the character of Sylvia 's shake of the hand than of the parting words of either his uncle or aunt . CHAPTER V STORY OF THE PRESS - GANG For a few days after the evening mentioned in the last chapter the weather was dull . Not in quick , sudden showers did the rain come down , but in constant drizzle , blotting out all colour from the surrounding landscape , and filling the air with fine gray mist , until people breathed more water than air . At such times the consciousness of the nearness of the vast unseen sea acted as a dreary depression to the spirits ; but besides acting on the nerves of the excitable , such weather affected the sensitive or ailing in material ways . Daniel Robson 's fit of rheumatism incapacitated him from stirring abroad ; and to a man of his active habits , and somewhat inactive mind , this was a great hardship . He was not ill - tempered naturally , but this state of confinement made him more ill - tempered than he had ever been before in his life . He sat in the chimney - corner , abusing the weather and doubting the wisdom or desirableness of all his wife saw fit to do in the usual daily household matters . The '
20496	20545	20748	20750	th ' feyther	5890	' was really a corner at Haytersbank . There were two projecting walls on each side of the fire - place , running about six feet into the room , and a stout wooden settle was placed against one of these , while opposite was the circular - backed '
20550	20738	20748	20750	th ' feyther	5890	' the seat of which was composed of a square piece of wood judiciously hollowed out , and placed with one corner to the front . Here , in full view of all the operations going on over the fire , sat Daniel Robson for four live - long days , advising and directing his wife in all such minor matters as the boiling of potatoes , the making of porridge , all the work on which she specially piqued herself , and on which she would have taken advice -- no ! not from the most skilled housewife in all the three Ridings . But , somehow , she managed to keep her tongue quiet from telling him , as she would have done any woman , and any other man , to mind his own business , or she would pin a dish - clout to his tail . She even checked Sylvia when the latter proposed , as much for fun as for anything else , that his ignorant directions should be followed , and the consequences brought before his eyes and his nose . '
20743	20747	20741	20741	na	1220	' said Bell , '
20749	20769	20748	20750	th ' feyther	5890	' feyther 's feyther , and we mun respect him . But it 's dree work havin' a man i '

20849	21138	21289	21289	Kester	222	' Bell sighed , for in these four days she had experienced somewhat of Madame de Maintenon 's difficulty ( and with fewer resources to meet it ) of trying to amuse a man who was not amusable . For Bell , good and sensible as she was , was not a woman of resources . Sylvia 's plan , undutiful as it was in her mother 's eyes , would have done Daniel more good , even though it might have made him angry , than his wife 's quiet , careful monotony of action , which , however it might conduce to her husband 's comfort when he was absent , did not amuse him when present . Sylvia scouted the notion of cousin Philip coming into their household in the character of an amusing or entertaining person , till she nearly made her mother angry at her ridicule of the good steady young fellow , to whom Bell looked up as the pattern of all that early manhood should be . But the moment Sylvia saw she had been giving her mother pain , she left off her wilful little jokes , and kissed her , and told her she would manage all famously , and ran out of the back - kitchen , in which mother and daughter had been scrubbing the churn and all the wooden implements of butter - making . Bell looked at the pretty figure of her little daughter , as , running past with her apron thrown over her head , she darkened the window beneath which her mother was doing her work . She paused just for a moment , and then said , almost unawares to herself , '
21144	21288	21404	21404	feyther	5625	' before resuming her scouring of what already looked almost snow - white . Sylvia scampered across the rough farmyard in the wetting , drizzling rain to the place where she expected to find Kester ; but he was not there , so she had to retrace her steps to the cow - house , and , making her way up a rough kind of ladder - staircase fixed straight against the wall , she surprised Kester as he sat in the wool - loft , looking over the fleeces reserved for the home - spinning , by popping her bright face , swathed round with her blue woollen apron , up through the trap - door , and thus , her head the only visible part , she addressed the farm - servant , who was almost like one of the family .

You had to cross a dirty farmyard , all puddles and dungheaps , on stepping - stones , to get to the door of the house - place . That great room itself was sure to have clothes hanging to dry at the fire , whatever day of the week it was ; some one of the large irregular family having had what is called in the district a '
26589	26827	26953	26953	i	0	' of a few articles , forgotten on the regular day . And sometimes these articles lay in their dirty state in the untidy kitchen , out of which a room , half parlour , half bedroom , opened on one side , and a dairy , the only clean place in the house , at the opposite . In face of you , as you entered the door , was the entrance to the working - kitchen , or scullery . Still , in spite of disorder like this , there was a well - to - do aspect about the place ; the Corneys were rich in their way , in flocks and herds as well as in children ; and to them neither dirt nor the perpetual bustle arising from ill - ordered work detracted from comfort . They were all of an easy , good - tempered nature ; Mrs. Corney and her daughters gave every one a welcome at whatever time of the day they came , and would just as soon sit down for a gossip at ten o'clock in the morning , as at five in the evening , though at the former time the house - place was full of work of various kinds which ought to be got out of hand and done with : while the latter hour was towards the end of the day , when farmers '

It was full of old gnarled apple - trees , their trunks covered with gray lichen , in which the cunning chaffinch built her nest in spring - time . The cankered branches remained on the trees , and added to the knotted interweaving overhead , if they did not to the productiveness ; the grass grew in long tufts , and was wet and tangled under foot . There was a tolerable crop of rosy apples still hanging on the gray old trees , and here and there they showed ruddy in the green bosses of untrimmed grass . Why the fruit was not gathered , as it was evidently ripe , would have puzzled any one not acquainted with the Corney family to say ; but to them it was always a maxim in practice , if not in precept , '

Sylvia did not quite understand the state of things as regarded politics and taxes -- and politics and taxes were all one in her mind , it must be confessed -- but she saw that her innocent little scheme of giving her father the change of society afforded by Donkin 's coming had answered ; and in the gladness of her heart she went out and ran round the corner of the house to find Kester , and obtain from him that sympathy in her success which she dared not ask from her mother .

30215	30422	31108	31108	Wesley	251	' There was a strange sensation , as if the cold sea - winds must bring with them the dim phantoms of those lost sailors , who had died far from their homes , and from the hallowed ground where their fathers lay . Each flight of steps up to this churchyard ended in a small flat space , on which a wooden seat was placed . On this particular Sunday , all these seats were filled by aged people , breathless with the unusual exertion of climbing . You could see the church stair , as it was called , from nearly every part of the town , and the figures of the numerous climbers , diminished by distance , looked like a busy ant - hill , long before the bell began to ring for afternoon service . All who could manage it had put on a bit of black in token of mourning ; it might be very little ; an old ribbon , a rusty piece of crape ; but some sign of mourning was shown by every one down to the little child in its mother 's arms , that innocently clutched the piece of rosemary to be thrown into the grave '
30426	31107	31122	31122	he	251	' Darley , the seaman shot by the press - gang , nine leagues off St. Abb 's Head , was to be buried to - day , at the accustomed time for the funerals of the poorer classes , directly after evening service , and there were only the sick and their nurse - tenders who did not come forth to show their feeling for the man whom they looked upon as murdered . The crowd of vessels in harbour bore their flags half - mast high ; and the crews were making their way through the High Street . The gentlefolk of Monkshaven , full of indignation at this interference with their ships , full of sympathy with the family who had lost their son and brother almost within sight of his home , came in unusual numbers -- no lack of patterns for Sylvia ; but her thoughts were far otherwise and more suitably occupied . The unwonted sternness and solemnity visible on the countenances of all whom she met awed and affected her . She did not speak in reply to Molly 's remarks on the dress or appearance of those who struck her . She felt as if these speeches jarred on her , and annoyed her almost to irritation ; yet Molly had come all the way to Monkshaven Church in her service , and deserved forbearance accordingly . The two mounted the steps alongside of many people ; few words were exchanged , even at the breathing places , so often the little centres of gossip . Looking over the sea there was not a sail to be seen ; it seemed bared of life , as if to be in serious harmony with what was going on inland . The church was of old Norman architecture ; low and massive outside : inside , of vast space , only a quarter of which was filled on ordinary Sundays . The walls were disfigured by numerous tablets of black and white marble intermixed , and the usual ornamentation of that style of memorial as erected in the last century , of weeping willows , urns , and drooping figures , with here and there a ship in full sail , or an anchor , where the seafaring idea prevalent through the place had launched out into a little originality . There was no wood - work , the church had been stripped of that , most probably when the neighbouring monastery had been destroyed . There were large square pews , lined with green baize , with the names of the families of the most flourishing ship - owners painted white on the doors ; there were pews , not so large , and not lined at all , for the farmers and shopkeepers of the parish ; and numerous heavy oaken benches which , by the united efforts of several men , might be brought within earshot of the pulpit . These were being removed into the most convenient situations when Molly and Sylvia entered the church , and after two or three whispered sentences they took their seats on one of these . The vicar of Monkshaven was a kindly , peaceable old man , hating strife and troubled waters above everything . He was a vehement Tory in theory , as became his cloth in those days . He had two bugbears to fear -- the French and the Dissenters . It was difficult to say of which he had the worst opinion and the most intense dread . Perhaps he hated the Dissenters most , because they came nearer in contact with him than the French ; besides , the French had the excuse of being Papists , while the Dissenters might have belonged to the Church of England if they had not been utterly depraved . Yet in practice Dr Wilson did not object to dine with Mr. Fishburn , who was a personal friend and follower of Wesley , but then , as the doctor would say , '
31142	31388	32460	32461	the Lord	5574	' But I do not know what excuse he would have alleged for sending broth and vegetables to old Ralph Thompson , a rabid Independent , who had been given to abusing the Church and the vicar , from a Dissenting pulpit , as long as ever he could mount the stairs . However , that inconsistency between Dr Wilson 's theories and practice was not generally known in Monkshaven , so we have nothing to do with it . Dr Wilson had had a very difficult part to play , and a still more difficult sermon to write , during this last week . The Darley who had been killed was the son of the vicar 's gardener , and Dr Wilson 's sympathies as a man had been all on the bereaved father 's side . But then he had received , as the oldest magistrate in the neighbourhood , a letter from the captain of the _ Aurora _ , explanatory and exculpatory . Darley had been resisting the orders of an officer in his Majesty 's service . What would become of due subordination and loyalty , and the interests of the service , and the chances of beating those confounded French , if such conduct as Darley 's was to be encouraged ? ( Poor Darley ! he was past all evil effects of human encouragement now ! ) So the vicar mumbled hastily over a sermon on the text , '
31398	32457	32460	32461	the Lord	5574	' ; which might have done as well for a baby cut off in a convulsion - fit as for the strong man shot down with all his eager blood hot within him , by men as hot - blooded as himself . But once when the old doctor 's eye caught the up - turned , straining gaze of the father Darley , seeking with all his soul to find a grain of holy comfort in the chaff of words , his conscience smote him . Had he nothing to say that should calm anger and revenge with spiritual power ? no breath of the comforter to soothe repining into resignation ? But again the discord between the laws of man and the laws of Christ stood before him ; and he gave up the attempt to do more than he was doing , as beyond his power . Though the hearers went away as full of anger as they had entered the church , and some with a dull feeling of disappointment as to what they had got there , yet no one felt anything but kindly towards the old vicar . His simple , happy life led amongst them for forty years , and open to all men in its daily course ; his sweet - tempered , cordial ways ; his practical kindness , made him beloved by all ; and neither he nor they thought much or cared much for admiration of his talents . Respect for his office was all the respect he thought of ; and that was conceded to him from old traditional and hereditary association . In looking back to the last century , it appears curious to see how little our ancestors had the power of putting two things together , and perceiving either the discord or harmony thus produced . Is it because we are farther off from those times , and have , consequently , a greater range of vision ? Will our descendants have a wonder about us , such as we have about the inconsistency of our forefathers , or a surprise at our blindness that we do not perceive that , holding such and such opinions , our course of action must be so and so , or that the logical consequence of particular opinions must be convictions which at present we hold in abhorrence ? It seems puzzling to look back on men such as our vicar , who almost held the doctrine that the King could do no wrong , yet were ever ready to talk of the glorious Revolution , and to abuse the Stuarts for having entertained the same doctrine , and tried to put it in practice . But such discrepancies ran through good men 's lives in those days . It is well for us that we live at the present time , when everybody is logical and consistent . This little discussion must be taken in place of Dr Wilson 's sermon , of which no one could remember more than the text half an hour after it was delivered . Even the doctor himself had the recollection of the words he had uttered swept out of his mind , as , having doffed his gown and donned his surplice , he came out of the dusk of his vestry and went to the church - door , looking into the broad light which came upon the plain of the church - yard on the cliffs ; for the sun had not yet set , and the pale moon was slowly rising through the silvery mist that obscured the distant moors . There was a thick , dense crowd , all still and silent , looking away from the church and the vicar , who awaited the bringing of the dead . They were watching the slow black line winding up the long steps , resting their heavy burden here and there , standing in silent groups at each landing - place ; now lost to sight as a piece of broken , overhanging ground intervened , now emerging suddenly nearer ; and overhead the great church bell , with its mediaeval inscription , familiar to the vicar , if to no one else who heard it , I to the grave do summon all , kept on its heavy booming monotone , with which no other sound from land or sea , near or distant , intermingled , except the cackle of the geese on some far - away farm on the moors , as they were coming home to roost ; and that one noise from so great a distance seemed only to deepen the stillness . Then there was a little movement in the crowd ; a little pushing from side to side , to make a path for the corpse and its bearers -- an aggregate of the fragments of room . With bent heads and spent strength , those who carried the coffin moved on ; behind came the poor old gardener , a brown - black funeral cloak thrown over his homely dress , and supporting his wife with steps scarcely less feeble than her own . He had come to church that afternoon , with a promise to her that he would return to lead her to the funeral of her firstborn ; for he felt , in his sore perplexed heart , full of indignation and dumb anger , as if he must go and hear something which should exorcize the unwonted longing for revenge that disturbed his grief , and made him conscious of that great blank of consolation which faithfulness produces . And for the time he was faithless . How came God to permit such cruel injustice of man ? Permitting it , He could not be good . Then what was life , and what was death , but woe and despair ? The beautiful solemn words of the ritual had done him good , and restored much of his faith . Though he could not understand why such sorrow had befallen him any more than before , he had come back to something of his childlike trust ; he kept saying to himself in a whisper , as he mounted the weary steps , '
32464	32707	32729	32730	the people	767	' ; and the repetition soothed him unspeakably . Behind this old couple followed their children , grown men and women , come from distant place or farmhouse service ; the servants at the vicarage , and many a neighbour , anxious to show their sympathy , and most of the sailors from the crews of the vessels in port , joined in procession , and followed the dead body into the church . There was too great a crowd immediately within the door for Sylvia and Molly to go in again , and they accordingly betook themselves to the place where the deep grave was waiting , wide and hungry , to receive its dead . There , leaning against the headstones all around , were many standing -- looking over the broad and placid sea , and turned to the soft salt air which blew on their hot eyes and rigid faces ; for no one spoke of all that number . They were thinking of the violent death of him over whom the solemn words were now being said in the gray old church , scarcely out of their hearing , had not the sound been broken by the measured lapping of the tide far beneath . Suddenly every one looked round towards the path from the churchyard steps . Two sailors were supporting a ghastly figure that , with feeble motions , was drawing near the open grave . '
32711	32728	32729	32730	the people	767	' specksioneer as tried to save him ! It 's him as was left for dead ! '
32734	32742	33129	33129	I	0	' It 's Charley Kinraid , as I 'm
32746	33128	33149	33149	I	0	' said Molly , starting forward to greet her cousin . But as he came on , she saw that all his strength was needed for the mere action of walking . The sailors , in their strong sympathy , had yielded to his earnest entreaty , and carried him up the steps , in order that he might see the last of his messmate . They placed him near the grave , resting against a stone ; and he was hardly there before the vicar came forth , and the great crowd poured out of the church , following the body to the grave . Sylvia was so much wrapt up in the solemnity of the occasion , that she had no thought to spare at the first moment for the pale and haggard figure opposite ; much less was she aware of her cousin Philip , who now singling her out for the first time from among the crowd , pressed to her side , with an intention of companionship and protection . As the service went on , ill - checked sobs rose from behind the two girls , who were among the foremost in the crowd , and by - and - by the cry and the wail became general . Sylvia 's tears rained down her face , and her distress became so evident that it attracted the attention of many in that inner circle . Among others who noticed it , the specksioneer 's hollow eyes were caught by the sight of the innocent blooming childlike face opposite to him , and he wondered if she were a relation ; yet , seeing that she bore no badge of mourning , he rather concluded that she must have been a sweetheart of the dead man . And now all was over : the rattle of the gravel on the coffin ; the last long , lingering look of friends and lovers ; the rosemary sprigs had been cast down by all who were fortunate enough to have brought them -- and oh ! how much Sylvia wished she had remembered this last act of respect -- and slowly the outer rim of the crowd began to slacken and disappear . Now Philip spoke to Sylvia . '

33290	33336	33339	33339	Charley	202	' said he , faintly , putting out his hand , but his eye passing her face to look at Sylvia in the background , her tear - stained face full of shy admiration of the nearest approach to a hero she had ever seen . '

35331	35388	35396	35397	Hester Rose	209	' said Philip , tenderly -- at least as tenderly as he durst , for he knew by experience that it did not do to alarm her girlish coyness . Either one speech or the other made Sylvia silent ; neither was accordant to her mood of mind ; so perhaps both contributed to her quietness . '
35399	35436	35461	35461	Jeremiah	204	' said Molly , always up in Monkshaven gossip . It was in the form of an assertion , but was said in the tone of a question , and as such Philip replied to it . '
35472	35633	35461	35461	Jeremiah	204	' And now they came to the stile which had filled Philip 's eye for some minutes past , though neither of the others had perceived they were so near it ; the stile which led to Moss Brow from the road into the fields that sloped down to Haystersbank . Here they would leave Molly , and now would begin the delicious _ tete - a - tete _ walk , which Philip always tried to make as lingering as possible . To - day he was anxious to show his sympathy with Sylvia , as far as he could read what was passing in her mind ; but how was he to guess the multitude of tangled thoughts in that unseen receptacle ? A resolution to be good , if she could , and always to be thinking on death , so that what seemed to her now as simply impossible , might come true -- that she might '
35642	35755	35461	35461	Jeremiah	204	' ; a wish that Philip were not coming home with her ; a wonder if the specksioneer really had killed a man , an idea which made her shudder ; yet from the awful fascination about it , her imagination was compelled to dwell on the tall , gaunt figure , and try to recall the wan countenance ; a hatred and desire of revenge on the press - gang , so vehement that it sadly militated against her intention of trying to be good ; all these notions , and wonders , and fancies , were whirling about in Sylvia 's brain , and at one of their promptings she spoke,-- '
35762	35775	35461	35461	Jeremiah	204	' Greenland seas?--I mean , how long do they take to reach ? '
35776	35797	35461	35461	Jeremiah	204	' I do n't know ; ten days or a fortnight , or more , maybe . I 'll ask . '

36692	37132	37240	37240	thee	1546	' That same evening , a trio alike in many outward circumstances sate in a small neat room in a house opening out of a confined court on the hilly side of the High Street of Monkshaven -- a mother , her only child , and the young man who silently loved that daughter , and was favoured by Alice Rose , though not by Hester . When the latter returned from her afternoon 's absence , she stood for a minute or two on the little flight of steep steps , whitened to a snowy whiteness ; the aspect of the whole house partook of the same character of irreproachable cleanliness . It was wedged up into a space which necessitated all sorts of odd projections and irregularities in order to obtain sufficient light for the interior ; and if ever the being situated in a dusky , confined corner might have been made an excuse for dirt , Alice Rose 's house had that apology . Yet the small diamond panes of glass in the casement window were kept so bright and clear that a great sweet - scented - leaved geranium grew and flourished , though it did not flower profusely . The leaves seemed to fill the air with fragrance as soon as Hester summoned up energy enough to open the door . Perhaps that was because the young Quaker , William Coulson , was crushing one between his finger and thumb , while waiting to set down Alice 's next words . For the old woman , who looked as if many years of life remained in her yet , was solemnly dictating her last will and testament . It had been on her mind for many months ; for she had something to leave beyond the mere furniture of the house . Something -- a few pounds -- in the hands of John and Jeremiah Foster , her cousins : and it was they who had suggested the duty on which she was engaged . She had asked William Coulson to write down her wishes , and he had consented , though with some fear and trepidation ; for he had an idea that he was infringing on a lawyer 's prerogative , and that , for aught he knew , he might be prosecuted for making a will without a licence , just as a man might be punished for selling wine and spirits without going through the preliminary legal forms that give permission for such a sale . But to his suggestion that Alice should employ a lawyer , she had replied-- '
37157	37237	37240	37240	thee	1546	' So he had bought , at her desire , a black - edged sheet of fine - wove paper , and a couple of good pens , on the previous Saturday ; and while waiting for her to begin her dictation , and full serious thought himself , he had almost unconsciously made the grand flourish at the top of the paper which he had learnt at school , and which was there called a spread - eagle . '
37244	37263	37240	37240	thee	1546	' asked Alice , suddenly alive to his proceedings . Without a word he showed her his handiwork . '
37269	37273	37240	37240	thee	1546	' said she , '

William stepped hastily forwards to hold up the heavy lid for her . She lifted up her head , looked at him full with her serene eyes , and thanked him for his little service . Then she took a creepie - stool and sate down on the side of the fire - place , having her back to the window . The hearth was of the same spotless whiteness as the steps ; all that was black about the grate was polished to the utmost extent ; all that was of brass , like the handle of the oven , was burnished bright . Her mother placed the little black earthenware teapot , in which the tea had been stewing , on the table , where cups and saucers were already set for four , and a large plate of bread and butter cut . Then they sate round the table , bowed their heads , and kept silence for a minute or two . When this grace was ended , and they were about to begin , Alice said , as if without premeditation , but in reality with a keen shrinking of heart out of sympathy with her child-- '

But Daniel went on to say that he did not mind if he stepped over with the sausages himself , when it was too late to do anything else . Sylvia longed to offer to accompany her father ; but , somehow , she did not like to propose it . Towards dusk she came to her mother to ask for the key of the great bureau that stood in the house - place as a state piece of furniture , although its use was to contain the family 's best wearing apparel , and stores of linen , such as might be supposed to be more needed upstairs .

It had been done , as he would himself have owned , to spite himself as well as them ; for it had obliged him to leave a sea - life , to which , in comparison , all life spent on shore was worse than nothing for dulness . For Robson had never reached that rank aboard ship which made his being unable to run up the rigging , or to throw a harpoon , or to fire off a gun , of no great consequence ; so he had to be thankful that an opportune legacy enabled him to turn farmer , a great degradation in his opinion . But his blood warmed , as he told the specksioneer , towards a sailor , and he pressed Kinraid to beguile the time when he was compelled to be ashore , by coming over to see him at Haytersbank , whenever he felt inclined . Sylvia , appearing to listen to Molly 's confidences , was hearkening in reality to all this conversation between her father and the specksioneer ; and at this invitation she became especially attentive . Kinraid replied,-- '
42053	42060	42052	42052	I	0	'm much obliged to ye , I 'm
42072	42080	42132	42132	thou'lt	1635	' you ; but as soon as I 'm

42108	42128	42182	42182	Sylvia	188	' said Daniel , rising to take leave , with unusual prudence as to the amount of his drink . '

Yet what could be more natural than that Molly Corney should wish her friend to be acquainted with the man whom Sylvia believed to be all but Molly 's engaged lover ? Pondering these thoughts , the walk home was as silent as that going to Moss Brow had been . The only change seemed to be that now they faced the brilliant northern lights flashing up the sky , and that either this appearance or some of the whaling narrations of Kinraid had stirred up Daniel Robson 's recollections of a sea ditty , which he kept singing to himself in a low , unmusical voice , the burden of which was , '

43056	43112	43048	43048	thou	1650	' said Bell , shortly , blowing out that which he had lighted , and placing one of her own on the dresser instead . Sylvia caught her mother 's look of displeasure , and it made her docile for the evening , although she owed her cousin a grudge for her enforced good behaviour . '

But her mother came round to look for something in the drawers of the dresser , and as she passed her daughter she said in a low voice-- '

And he had his reward ; for in a very short time , Sylvia stood before him with her book in her hand , prepared to say her spelling . At which he also stood up by instinct , and listened to her slow succeeding letters ; helping her out , when she looked up at him with a sweet childlike perplexity in her face : for a dunce as to book - learning poor Sylvia was and was likely to remain ; and , in spite of his assumed office of schoolmaster , Philip Hepburn could almost have echoed the words of the lover of Jess MacFarlane-- I sent my love a letter , But , alas ! she canna read , And I lo'e her a '

44877	44887	44898	44898	Sylvie	188	' said Bell Robson , thinking the conversation unseemly . '
44900	44914	44898	44898	Sylvie	188	' But Sylvia turned her back on him , and he could hardly say '
44918	46101	44898	44898	Sylvie	188	' to Daniel , who had caused such an unpleasant end to an evening that had at one time been going on so well . CHAPTER IX THE SPECKSIONEER A few days after , Farmer Robson left Haytersbank betimes on a longish day 's journey , to purchase a horse . Sylvia and her mother were busied with a hundred household things , and the early winter 's evening closed in upon them almost before they were aware . The consequences of darkness in the country even now are to gather the members of a family together into one room , and to make them settle to some sedentary employment ; and it was much more the case at the period of my story , when candles were far dearer than they are at present , and when one was often made to suffice for a large family . The mother and daughter hardly spoke at all when they sat down at last . The cheerful click of the knitting - needles made a pleasant home - sound ; and in the occasional snatches of slumber that overcame her mother , Sylvia could hear the long - rushing boom of the waves , down below the rocks , for the Haytersbank gulley allowed the sullen roar to come up so far inland . It might have been about eight o'clock -- though from the monotonous course of the evening it seemed much later -- when Sylvia heard her father 's heavy step cranching down the pebbly path . More unusual , she heard his voice talking to some companion . Curious to see who it could be , with a lively instinctive advance towards any event which might break the monotony she had begun to find somewhat dull , she sprang up to open the door . Half a glance into the gray darkness outside made her suddenly timid , and she drew back behind the door as she opened it wide to admit her father and Kinraid . Daniel Robson came in bright and boisterous . He was pleased with his purchase , and had had some drink to celebrate his bargain . He had ridden the new mare into Monkshaven , and left her at the smithy there until morning , to have her feet looked at , and to be new shod . On his way from the town he had met Kinraid wandering about in search of Haytersbank Farm itself , so he had just brought him along with him ; and here they were , ready for bread and cheese , and aught else the mistress would set before them . To Sylvia the sudden change into brightness and bustle occasioned by the entrance of her father and the specksioneer was like that which you may effect any winter 's night , when you come into a room where a great lump of coal lies hot and slumbering on the fire ; just break it up with a judicious blow from the poker , and the room , late so dark , and dusk , and lone , is full of life , and light , and warmth . She moved about with pretty household briskness , attending to all her father 's wants . Kinraid 's eye watched her as she went backwards and forwards , to and fro , into the pantry , the back - kitchen , out of light into shade , out of the shadow into the broad firelight where he could see and note her appearance . She wore the high - crowned linen cap of that day , surmounting her lovely masses of golden brown hair , rather than concealing them , and tied firm to her head by a broad blue ribbon . A long curl hung down on each side of her neck -- her throat rather , for her neck was concealed by a little spotted handkerchief carefully pinned across at the waist of her brown stuff gown . How well it was , thought the young girl , that she had doffed her bed - gown and linsey - woolsey petticoat , her working - dress , and made herself smart in her stuff gown , when she sate down to work with her mother . By the time she could sit down again , her father and Kinraid had their glasses filled , and were talking of the relative merits of various kinds of spirits ; that led on to tales of smuggling , and the different contrivances by which they or their friends had eluded the preventive service ; the nightly relays of men to carry the goods inland ; the kegs of brandy found by certain farmers whose horses had gone so far in the night , that they could do no work the next day ; the clever way in which certain women managed to bring in prohibited goods ; in fact , that when a woman did give her mind to smuggling , she was more full of resources , and tricks , and impudence , and energy than any man . There was no question of the morality of the affair ; one of the greatest signs of the real progress we have made since those times seems to be that our daily concerns of buying and selling , eating and drinking , whatsoever we do , are more tested by the real practical standard of our religion than they were in the days of our grandfathers . Neither Sylvia nor her mother was in advance of their age . Both listened with admiration to the ingenious devices , and acted as well as spoken lies , that were talked about as fine and spirited things . Yet if Sylvia had attempted one tithe of this deceit in her every - day life , it would have half broken her mother 's heart . But when the duty on salt was strictly and cruelly enforced , making it penal to pick up rough dirty lumps containing small quantities that might be thrown out with the ashes of the brine - houses on the high - roads ; when the price of this necessary was so increased by the tax upon it as to make it an expensive , sometimes an unattainable , luxury to the working man , Government did more to demoralise the popular sense of rectitude and uprightness than heaps of sermons could undo . And the same , though in smaller measure , was the consequence of many other taxes . It may seem curious to trace up the popular standard of truth to taxation ; but I do not think the idea would be so very far - fetched . From smuggling adventures it was easy to pass on to stories of what had happened to Robson , in his youth a sailor in the Greenland seas , and to Kinraid , now one of the best harpooners in any whaler that sailed off the coast .

51178	51254	51055	51055	Sylvie	188	' This seemed to be Sylvia 's last protest against learning for the night , for after this she turned docile , and really took pains to understand all that Philip could teach her , by means of the not unskilful , though rude , map which he drew for her with a piece of charred wood on his aunt 's dresser . He had asked his aunt 's leave before beginning what Sylvia called his '
51258	51993	52024	52025	that fellow	1808	' but by - and - by even she became a little interested in starting from a great black spot called Monkshaven , and in the shaping of land and sea around that one centre . Sylvia held her round chin in the palms of her hands , supporting her elbows on the dresser ; looking down at the progress of the rough drawing in general , but now and then glancing up at him with sudden inquiry . All along he was not so much absorbed in his teaching as to be unconscious of her sweet proximity . She was in her best mood towards him ; neither mutinous nor saucy ; and he was striving with all his might to retain her interest , speaking better than ever he had done before ( such brightness did love call forth!)--understanding what she would care to hear and to know ; when , in the middle of an attempt at explaining the cause of the long polar days , of which she had heard from her childhood , he felt that her attention was no longer his ; that a discord had come in between their minds ; that she had passed out of his power . This certainty of intuition lasted but for an instant ; he had no time to wonder or to speculate as to what had affected her so adversely to his wishes before the door opened and Kinraid came in . Then Hepburn knew that she must have heard his coming footsteps , and recognized them . He angrily stiffened himself up into coldness of demeanour . Almost to his surprise , Sylvia 's greeting to the new comer was as cold as his own . She stood rather behind him ; so perhaps she did not see the hand which Kinraid stretched out towards her , for she did not place her own little palm in it , as she had done to Philip an hour ago . And she hardly spoke , but began to pore over the rough black map , as if seized with strong geographical curiosity , or determined to impress Philip 's lesson deep on her memory . Still Philip was dismayed by seeing the warm welcome which Kinraid received from the master of the house , who came in from the back premises almost at the same time as the specksioneer entered at the front . Hepburn was uneasy , too , at finding Kinraid take his seat by the fireside , like one accustomed to the ways of the house . Pipes were soon produced . Philip disliked smoking . Possibly Kinraid did so too , but he took a pipe at any rate , and lighted it , though he hardly used it at all , but kept talking to farmer Robson on sea affairs . He had the conversation pretty much to himself . Philip sat gloomily by ; Sylvia and his aunt were silent , and old Robson smoked his long clay pipe , from time to time taking it out of his mouth to spit into the bright copper spittoon , and to shake the white ashes out of the bowl . Before he replaced it , he would give a short laugh of relishing interest in Kinraid 's conversation ; and now and then he put in a remark . Sylvia perched herself sideways on the end of the dresser , and made pretence to sew ; but Philip could see how often she paused in her work to listen . By - and - by , his aunt spoke to him , and they kept up a little side conversation , more because Bell Robson felt that her nephew , her own flesh and blood , was put out , than for any special interest they either of them felt in what they were saying . Perhaps , also , they neither of them disliked showing that they had no great faith in the stories Kinraid was telling . Mrs. Robson , at any rate , knew so little as to be afraid of believing too much . Philip was sitting on that side of the fire which was nearest to the window and to Sylvia , and opposite to the specksioneer . At length he turned to his cousin and said in a low voice-- '
52012	52023	52024	52025	that fellow	1808	' The colour came into Sylvia 's cheek at the words '
52026	52036	52024	52025	that fellow	1808	' ; but she only replied with a careless air-- '
52040	52070	52274	52274	Hepburn	191	'm one as thinks enough is as good as a feast ; and I 've had enough of geography this one night , thank you kindly all the same . '
52264	52272	52274	52274	Hepburn	191	' How comes that sailor chap here ? '
52279	52290	52300	52300	she	5798	' He 's none fit to be where Sylvia is . '
52291	52298	52300	52300	she	5798	' Nay , I dunnot know , '

52396	52412	52363	52363	he	1818	' I could show them a score as good as he down on the quayside . '
52413	52445	52701	52702	farmer Robson	188	' Well , laddie , keep a calm sough . Some folk like some folk and others do n't . Wherever I am there 'll allays be a welcome for thee . '
52692	52699	52792	52792	she	188	' Take another glass , Philip , '
52768	52782	52792	52792	she	188	' I do n't think you care much for learning geography , Sylvie ? '
52783	52790	52818	52818	he	191	' Not much to - night , '
52810	52816	52818	52818	he	191	' Nor at any time , '
52824	52871	52935	52935	Hepburn	191	' nor for any kind of learning . I did bring some books last time I came , meaning to teach you many a thing -- but now I 'll just trouble you for my books ; I put them on yon shelf by the Bible . '
52922	52933	52995	52995	I	0	' And so you wo n't learn any more geography , '
52980	52993	53003	53003	I	0	' Yo're niver angry with me , Philip ? Sooner than vex yo '
53004	53018	53094	53094	he	191	'm just stupid ; and it mun be such a trouble to you . '
53102	53107	53903	53903	thee	188	' good - night , '
53324	53468	53903	53903	thee	188	' standing ; and then , her anger quenching her incipient regard , she went about her daily business pretty much as though he had never been . He had gone away out of her sight into the thick mist of unseen life from which he had emerged -- gone away without a word , and she might never see him again . But still there was a chance of her seeing him when he came to marry Molly Corney . Perhaps she should be bridesmaid , and then what a pleasant merry time the wedding - day would be ! The Corneys were all such kind people , and in their family there never seemed to be the checks and restraints by which her own mother hedged her round . Then there came an overwhelming self - reproaching burst of love for that '
53471	53896	53916	53918	a bonny lass	1839	' ; a humiliation before her slightest wish , as penance for the moment 's unspoken treason ; and thus Sylvia was led to request her cousin Philip to resume his lessons in so meek a manner , that he slowly and graciously acceded to a request which he was yearning to fulfil all the time . During the ensuing winter , all went on in monotonous regularity at Haytersbank Farm for many weeks . Hepburn came and went , and thought Sylvia wonderfully improved in docility and sobriety ; and perhaps also he noticed the improvement in her appearance . For she was at that age when a girl changes rapidly , and generally for the better . Sylvia shot up into a tall young woman ; her eyes deepened in colour , her face increased in expression , and a sort of consciousness of unusual good looks gave her a slight tinge of coquettish shyness with the few strangers whom she ever saw . Philip hailed her interest in geography as another sign of improvement . He had brought back his book of maps to the farm ; and there he sat on many an evening teaching his cousin , who had strange fancies respecting the places about which she wished to learn , and was coolly indifferent to the very existence of other towns , and countries , and seas far more famous in story . She was occasionally wilful , and at times very contemptuous as to the superior knowledge of her instructor ; but , in spite of it all , Philip went regularly on the appointed evenings to Haytersbank -- through keen black east wind , or driving snow , or slushing thaw ; for he liked dearly to sit a little behind her , with his arm on the back of her chair , she stooping over the outspread map , with her eyes,--could he have seen them,--a good deal fixed on one spot in the map , not Northumberland , where Kinraid was spending the winter , but those wild northern seas about which he had told them such wonders . One day towards spring , she saw Molly Corney coming towards the farm . The companions had not met for many weeks , for Molly had been from home visiting her relations in the north . Sylvia opened the door , and stood smiling and shivering on the threshold , glad to see her friend again . Molly called out , when a few paces off,-- '
53922	53923	53916	53918	a bonny lass	1839	' '
53931	53996	54008	54008	She	1468	' said Bell Robson , hospitably leaving her ironing and coming to the door ; but though the mother tried to look as if she thought it nonsense , she could hardly keep down the smile that shone out of her eyes , as she put her hand on Sylvia 's shoulder , with a fond sense of proprietorship in what was being praised . '
54003	54007	54008	54008	She	1468	' persisted Molly . '
54015	54033	54008	54008	She	1468	' I saw her . And if I do n't tell her so , the men will . '

54041	54062	54066	54066	they	1841	' said Sylvia , more than half offended , and turning away in a huff at the open barefaced admiration . '

54115	54157	54160	54160	I	0	' said Mrs. Robson , with severe sadness ; for now Molly was getting to talk as she disliked . But Molly 's purpose was to bring the conversation round to her own affairs , of which she was very full . '

Sylvia was annoyed at Molly 's whole tone and manner , which were loud , laughing , and boisterous ; but to her mother they were positively repugnant . She said shortly and gravely,-- '

Although Charley Kinraid was not the bridegroom , Sylvia 's promise to be bridesmaid was claimed . But the friendship brought on by the circumstances of neighbourhood and parity of age had become very much weakened in the time that elapsed between Molly 's engagement and wedding . In the first place , she herself was so absorbed in her preparations , so elated by her good fortune in getting married , and married , too , before her elder sister , that all her faults blossomed out full and strong . Sylvia felt her to be selfish ; Mrs. Robson thought her not maidenly . A year before she would have been far more missed and regretted by Sylvia ; now it was almost a relief to the latter to be freed from the perpetual calls upon her sympathy , from the constant demands upon her congratulations , made by one who had no thought or feeling to bestow on others ; at least , not in these weeks of '
55144	55737	55740	55740	her	1865	' as Mrs. Robson persisted in calling it . It was seldom that Bell was taken with a humorous idea ; but this once having hatched a solitary joke , she was always clucking it into notice -- to go on with her own poultry simile . Every time during that summer that Philip saw his cousin , he thought her prettier than she had ever been before ; some new touch of colour , some fresh sweet charm , seemed to have been added , just as every summer day calls out new beauty in the flowers . And this was not the addition of Philip 's fancy . Hester Rose , who met Sylvia on rare occasions , came back each time with a candid , sad acknowledgement in her heart that it was no wonder that Sylvia was so much admired and loved . One day Hester had seen her sitting near her mother in the market - place ; there was a basket by her , and over the clean cloth that covered the yellow pounds of butter , she had laid the hedge - roses and honeysuckles she had gathered on the way into Monkshaven ; her straw hat was on her knee , and she was busy placing some of the flowers in the ribbon that went round it . Then she held it on her hand , and turned it round about , putting her head on one side , the better to view the effect ; and all this time , Hester , peeping at her through the folds of the stuffs displayed in Foster 's windows , saw her with admiring , wistful eyes ; wondering , too , if Philip , at the other counter , were aware of his cousin 's being there , so near to him . Then Sylvia put on her hat , and , looking up at Foster 's windows , caught Hester 's face of interest , and smiled and blushed at the consciousness of having been watched over her little vanities , and Hester smiled back , but rather sadly . Then a customer came in , and she had to attend to her business , which , on this as on all market days , was great . In the midst she was aware of Philip rushing bare - headed out of the shop , eager and delighted at something he saw outside . There was a little looking - glass hung against the wall on Hester 's side , placed in that retired corner , in order that the good women who came to purchase head - gear of any kind might see the effect thereof before they concluded their bargain . In a pause of custom , Hester , half - ashamed , stole into this corner , and looked at herself in the glass . What did she see ? a colourless face , dark soft hair with no light gleams in it , eyes that were melancholy instead of smiling , a mouth compressed with a sense of dissatisfaction . This was what she had to compare with the bright bonny face in the sunlight outside . She gave a gulp to check the sigh that was rising , and came back , even more patient than she had been before this disheartening peep , to serve all the whims and fancies of purchasers . Sylvia herself had been rather put out by Philip 's way of coming to her . '
55745	55750	55754	55754	he	1866	' she thought ; and '
55772	55803	55807	55807	thou	1868	' ; and when he took to admiring her hat , she pulled out the flowers in a pet , and threw them down , and trampled them under foot . '
55813	55818	55754	55754	he	1866	' said her mother . '

55838	55850	55861	55862	her mother	5519	' I do n't like Philip to speak to me so , '
55856	55859	56472	56472	Philip	191	' How ? '
56466	56471	56485	56485	he	191	' Is she pretty ? '
56492	56501	56509	56509	Hester	209	' I believe some folks think her so . '
56502	56507	56485	56485	he	191	' But do you ? '
56524	56532	56878	56878	Yo	1892	' There 's no need for talking o '
56536	56877	56878	56878	Yo	1892	' he answered , with abrupt displeasure . Hester silenced her curiosity from that time . But her heart was not quite at ease , and she kept on wondering whether Philip thought his little cousin pretty until she saw her and him together , on that occasion of which we have spoken , when Sylvia came to the shop to buy her new cloak ; and after that Hester never wondered whether Philip thought his cousin pretty or no , for she knew quite well . Bell Robson had her own anxieties on the subject of her daughter 's increasing attractions . She apprehended the dangers consequent upon certain facts , by a mental process more akin to intuition than reason . She was uncomfortable , even while her motherly vanity was flattered , at the admiration Sylvia received from the other sex . This admiration was made evident to her mother in many ways . When Sylvia was with her at market , it might have been thought that the doctors had prescribed a diet of butter and eggs to all the men under forty in Monkshaven . At first it seemed to Mrs. Robson but a natural tribute to the superior merit of her farm produce ; but by degrees she perceived that if Sylvia remained at home , she stood no better chance than her neighbours of an early sale . There were more customers than formerly for the fleeces stored in the wool - loft ; comely young butchers came after the calf almost before it had been decided to sell it ; in short , excuses were seldom wanting to those who wished to see the beauty of Haytersbank Farm . All this made Bell uncomfortable , though she could hardly have told what she dreaded . Sylvia herself seemed unspoilt by it as far as her home relations were concerned . A little thoughtless she had always been , and thoughtless she was still ; but , as her mother had often said , '
56879	56888	56966	56966	She	1893	' canna put old heads on young shoulders ; '

60044	60553	60898	60898	travellers	2006	' Philip set out on his two - mile walk home with a tumult of happiness in his heart . He was not often carried away by delusions of his own creating ; to - night he thought he had good ground for believing that by patient self - restraint he might win Sylvia 's love . A year ago he had nearly earned her dislike by obtruding upon her looks and words betokening his passionate love . He alarmed her girlish coyness , as well as wearied her with the wish he had then felt that she should take an interest in his pursuits . But , with unusual wisdom , he had perceived his mistake ; it was many months now since he had betrayed , by word or look , that she was anything more to him than a little cousin to be cared for and protected when need was . The consequence was that she had become tamed , just as a wild animal is tamed ; he had remained tranquil and impassive , almost as if he did not perceive her shy advances towards friendliness . These advances were made by her after the lessons had ceased . She was afraid lest he was displeased with her behaviour in rejecting his instructions , and was not easy till she was at peace with him ; and now , to all appearance , he and she were perfect friends , but nothing more . In his absence she would not allow her young companions to laugh at his grave sobriety of character , and somewhat prim demeanour ; she would even go against her conscience , and deny that she perceived any peculiarity . When she wanted it , she sought his advice on such small subjects as came up in her daily life ; and she tried not to show signs of weariness when he used more words -- and more difficult words -- than were necessary to convey his ideas . But her ideal husband was different from Philip in every point , the two images never for an instant merged into one . To Philip she was the only woman in the world ; it was the one subject on which he dared not consider , for fear that both conscience and judgment should decide against him , and that he should be convinced against his will that she was an unfit mate for him , that she never would be his , and that it was waste of time and life to keep her shrined in the dearest sanctuary of his being , to the exclusion of all the serious and religious aims which , in any other case , he would have been the first to acknowledge as the object he ought to pursue . For he had been brought up among the Quakers , and shared in their austere distrust of a self - seeking spirit ; yet what else but self - seeking was his passionate prayer , '
60564	60897	60898	60898	travellers	2006	' No other vision had ever crossed his masculine fancy for a moment ; his was a rare and constant love that deserved a better fate than it met with . At this time his hopes were high , as I have said , not merely as to the growth of Sylvia 's feelings towards him , but as to the probability of his soon being in a position to place her in such comfort , as his wife , as she had never enjoyed before . For the brothers Foster were thinking of retiring from business , and relinquishing the shop to their two shopmen , Philip Hepburn and William Coulson . To be sure , it was only by looking back for a few months , and noticing chance expressions and small indications , that this intention of theirs could be discovered . But every step they took tended this way , and Philip knew their usual practice of deliberation too well to feel in the least impatient for the quicker progress of the end which he saw steadily approaching . The whole atmosphere of life among the Friends at this date partook of this character of self - repression , and both Coulson and Hepburn shared in it . Coulson was just as much aware of the prospect opening before him as Hepburn ; but they never spoke together on the subject , although their mutual knowledge might be occasionally implied in their conversation on their future lives . Meanwhile the Fosters were imparting more of the background of their business to their successors . For the present , at least , the brothers meant to retain an interest in the shop , even after they had given up the active management ; and they sometimes thought of setting up a separate establishment as bankers . The separation of the business,--the introduction of their shopmen to the distant manufacturers who furnished their goods ( in those days the system of '
60899	61003	61445	61445	he	191	' was not so widely organized as it is at present),--all these steps were in gradual progress ; and already Philip saw himself in imagination in the dignified position of joint master of the principal shop in Monkshaven , with Sylvia installed as his wife , with certainly a silk gown , and possibly a gig at her disposal . In all Philip 's visions of future prosperity , it was Sylvia who was to be aggrandized by them ; his own life was to be spent as it was now , pretty much between the four shop walls .

Besides ( he told his conscience ) he was pledged to his aunt to watch over Sylvia like a brother . So in the interval before New Year 's Eve , he silently revelled as much as any young girl in the anticipation of the happy coming time . At this hour , all the actors in this story having played out their parts and gone to their rest , there is something touching in recording the futile efforts made by Philip to win from Sylvia the love he yearned for . But , at the time , any one who had watched him might have been amused to see the grave , awkward , plain young man studying patterns and colours for a new waistcoat , with his head a little on one side , after the meditative manner common to those who are choosing a new article of dress . They might have smiled could they have read in his imagination the frequent rehearsals of the coming evening , when he and she should each be dressed in their gala attire , to spend a few hours under a bright , festive aspect , among people whose company would oblige them to assume a new demeanour towards each other , not so familiar as their every - day manner , but allowing more scope for the expression of rustic gallantry . Philip had so seldom been to anything of the kind , that , even had Sylvia not been going , he would have felt a kind of shy excitement at the prospect of anything so unusual . But , indeed , if Sylvia had not been going , it is very probable that Philip 's rigid conscience might have been aroused to the question whether such parties did not savour too much of the world for him to form one in them . As it was , however , the facts to him were simply these . He was going and she was going . The day before , he had hurried off to Haytersbank Farm with a small paper parcel in his pocket -- a ribbon with a little briar - rose pattern running upon it for Sylvia . It was the first thing he had ever ventured to give her -- the first thing of the kind would , perhaps , be more accurate ; for when he had first begun to teach her any lessons , he had given her Mavor 's Spelling - book , but that he might have done , out of zeal for knowledge , to any dunce of a little girl of his acquaintance . This ribbon was quite a different kind of present ; he touched it tenderly , as if he were caressing it , when he thought of her wearing it ; the briar - rose ( sweetness and thorns ) seemed to be the very flower for her ; the soft , green ground on which the pink and brown pattern ran , was just the colour to show off her complexion . And she would in a way belong to him : her cousin , her mentor , her chaperon , her lover ! While others only admired , he might hope to appropriate ; for of late they had been such happy friends ! Her mother approved of him , her father liked him . A few months , perhaps only a few weeks more of self - restraint , and then he might go and speak openly of his wishes , and what he had to offer . For he had resolved , with the quiet force of his character , to wait until all was finally settled between him and his masters , before he declared himself to either Sylvia or her parents . The interval was spent in patient , silent endeavours to recommend himself to her . He had to give his ribbon to his aunt in charge for Sylvia , and that was a disappointment to his fancy , although he tried to reason himself into thinking that it was better so . He had not time to wait for her return from some errand on which she had gone , for he was daily more and more occupied with the affairs of the shop . Sylvia made many a promise to her mother , and more to herself , that she would not stay late at the party , but she might go as early as she liked ; and before the December daylight had faded away , Sylvia presented herself at the Corneys '

Scraps of costly Indian chintzes and palempours were intermixed with commoner black and red calico in minute hexagons ; and the variety of patterns served for the useful purpose of promoting conversation as well as the more obvious one of displaying the work - woman 's taste . Sylvia , for instance , began at once to her old friend , Molly Brunton , who had accompanied her into this chamber to take off her hat and cloak , with a remark on one of the chintzes . Stooping over the counterpane , with a face into which the flush would come whether or no , she said to Molly,-- '

The candles of those days gave but a faint light compared to the light of the immense fire , which it was a point of hospitality to keep at the highest roaring , blazing pitch ; the young women occupied the seats , with the exception of two or three of the elder ones , who , in an eager desire to show their capability , insisted on helping Mrs. Corney in her duties , very much to her annoyance , as there were certain little contrivances for eking out cream , and adjusting the strength of the cups of tea to the worldly position of the intended drinkers , which she did not like every one to see . The young men,--whom tea did not embolden , and who had as yet had no chance of stronger liquor,--clustered in rustic shyness round the door , not speaking even to themselves , except now and then , when one , apparently the wag of the party , made some whispered remark , which set them all off laughing ; but in a minute they checked themselves , and passed the back of their hands across their mouths to compose that unlucky feature , and then some would try to fix their eyes on the rafters of the ceiling , in a manner which was decorous if rather abstracted from the business in hand . Most of these were young farmers , with whom Philip had nothing in common , and from whom , in shy reserve , he had withdrawn himself when he first came in . But now he wished himself among them sooner than set to talk to Nancy Pratt , when he had nothing to say . And yet he might have had a companion less to his mind , for she was a decent young woman of a sober age , less inclined to giggle than many of the younger ones . But all the time that he was making commonplace remarks to her he was wondering if he had offended Sylvia , and why she would not shake hands with him , and this pre - occupation of his thoughts did not make him an agreeable companion . Nancy Pratt , who had been engaged for some years to a mate of a whaling - ship , perceived something of his state of mind , and took no offence at it ; on the contrary , she tried to give him pleasure by admiring Sylvia .

This jug was the pride of her heart , and was in the shape of a fat man in white knee - breeches , and a three - cornered hat ; with one arm he supported the pipe in his broad , smiling mouth , and the other was placed akimbo and formed the handle .

And if they thought any evil of her master 's going to bed , or that by that early retirement he meant to imply that he did not bid his friends welcome , why he would not stay up beyond eight o'clock for King George upon his throne , as he 'd tell them soon enough , if they 'd only step upstairs and ask him . Well ; she knowed what it was to want a daughter when she was ailing , so she 'd say nought more , but hasten supper . And this idea now took possession of Mrs. Corney 's mind , for she would not willingly allow one of her guests to leave before they had done justice to her preparations ; and , cutting her speech short , she hastily left Sylvia and Philip together . His heart beat fast ; his feeling towards her had never been so strong or so distinct as since her refusal to kiss the '
69659	69866	69867	69867	I	0	' He was on the point of speaking , of saying something explicitly tender , when the wooden trencher which the party were using at their play , came bowling between him and Sylvia , and spun out its little period right betwixt them . Every one was moving from chair to chair , and when the bustle was over Sylvia was seated at some distance from him , and he left standing outside the circle , as if he were not playing . In fact , Sylvia had unconsciously taken his place as actor in the game while he remained spectator , and , as it turned out , an auditor of a conversation not intended for his ears . He was wedged against the wall , close to the great eight - day clock , with its round moon - like smiling face forming a ludicrous contrast to his long , sallow , grave countenance , which was pretty much at the same level above the sanded floor . Before him sat Molly Brunton and one of her sisters , their heads close together in too deep talk to attend to the progress of the game . Philip 's attention was caught by the words-- '

But between the busy heads and over - reaching arms he could see Charley and Sylvia , sitting close together , talking and listening more than eating . She was in a new strange state of happiness not to be reasoned about , or accounted for , but in a state of more exquisite feeling than she had ever experienced before ; when , suddenly lifting her eyes , she caught Philip 's face of extreme displeasure .

72228	72789	72995	72995	Philip	191	' ; but somehow she could not say this , for in truth Philip 's look showed that he would be but a wet blanket on the merriment of the party . So , with as much civility as could be mustered up between them , he took leave . Shutting the door behind him , he went out into the dreary night , and began his lonesome walk back to Monkshaven . The cold sleet almost blinded him as the sea - wind drove it straight in his face ; it cut against him as it was blown with drifting force . The roar of the wintry sea came borne on the breeze ; there was more light from the whitened ground than from the dark laden sky above . The field - paths would have been a matter of perplexity , had it not been for the well - known gaps in the dyke - side , which showed the whitened land beyond , between the two dark stone walls . Yet he went clear and straight along his way , having unconsciously left all guidance to the animal instinct which co - exists with the human soul , and sometimes takes strange charge of the human body , when all the nobler powers of the individual are absorbed in acute suffering . At length he was in the lane , toiling up the hill , from which , by day , Monkshaven might be seen . Now all features of the landscape before him were lost in the darkness of night , against which the white flakes came closer and nearer , thicker and faster . On a sudden , the bells of Monkshaven church rang out a welcome to the new year , 1796 . From the direction of the wind , it seemed as if the sound was flung with strength and power right into Philip 's face . He walked down the hill to its merry sound -- its merry sound , his heavy heart . As he entered the long High Street of Monkshaven he could see the watching lights put out in parlour , chamber , or kitchen . The new year had come , and expectation was ended . Reality had begun . He turned to the right , into the court where he lodged with Alice Rose . There was a light still burning there , and cheerful voices were heard . He opened the door ; Alice , her daughter , and Coulson stood as if awaiting him . Hester 's wet cloak hung on a chair before the fire ; she had her hood on , for she and Coulson had been to the watch - night . The solemn excitement of the services had left its traces upon her countenance and in her mind . There was a spiritual light in her usually shadowed eyes , and a slight flush on her pale cheek . Merely personal and self - conscious feelings were merged in a loving good - will to all her fellow - creatures . Under the influence of this large charity , she forgot her habitual reserve , and came forward as Philip entered to meet him with her new year 's wishes -- wishes that she had previously interchanged with the other two . '
72812	72992	72995	72995	Philip	191	' He took her hand , and shook it warmly in reply . The flush on her cheek deepened as she withdrew it . Alice Rose said something curtly about the lateness of the hour and her being much tired ; and then she and her daughter went upstairs to the front chamber , and Philip and Coulson to that which they shared at the back of the house . CHAPTER XIII PERPLEXITIES Coulson and Philip were friendly , but not intimate . They never had had a dispute , they never were confidential with each other ; in truth , they were both reserved and silent men , and , probably , respected each other the more for being so self - contained . There was a private feeling in Coulson 's heart which would have made a less amiable fellow dislike Philip . But of this the latter was unconscious : they were not apt to exchange many words in the room which they occupied jointly . Coulson asked Philip if he had enjoyed himself at the Corneys '
72997	73009	72995	72995	Philip	191	' Not much ; such parties are noane to my liking . '
73010	73018	73085	73086	Jonas Barclay	314	' And yet thou broke off from t '
73026	73084	73158	73158	he	207	' No answer ; so Coulson went on , with a sense of the duty laid upon him , to improve the occasion -- the first that had presented itself since the good old Methodist minister had given his congregation the solemn warning to watch over the opportunities of various kinds which the coming year would present . '
73093	73100	73146	73146	yo	191	' this world were like apples o '
73113	73144	73158	73158	he	207	' Coulson wisely left Philip to make the application for himself . If he did he made no sign , but threw himself on his bed with a heavy sigh . '
73147	73153	73248	73249	the Corneys	242	' not going to undress ? '
73250	73830	73248	73249	the Corneys	242	' kitchen and the scenes that had taken place in it , passing like a pageant before his closed eyes . Then he opened them in angry weariness at the recurring vision , and tried to make out the outlines of the room and the furniture in the darkness . The white ceiling sloped into the whitewashed walls , and against them he could see the four rush - bottomed chairs , the looking - glass hung on one side , the old carved oak - chest ( his own property , with the initials of forgotten ancestors cut upon it ) , which held his clothes ; the boxes that belonged to Coulson , sleeping soundly in the bed in the opposite corner of the room ; the casement window in the roof , through which the snowy ground on the steep hill - side could be plainly seen ; and when he got so far as this in the catalogue of the room , he fell into a troubled feverish sleep , which lasted two or three hours ; and then he awoke with a start , and a consciousness of uneasiness , though what about he could not remember at first . When he recollected all that had happened the night before , it impressed him much more favourably than it had done at the time . If not joy , hope had come in the morning ; and , at any rate , he could be up and be doing , for the late wintry light was stealing down the hill - side , and he knew that , although Coulson lay motionless in his sleep , it was past their usual time of rising . Still , as it was new year 's Day , a time of some licence , Philip had mercy on his fellow - shopman , and did not waken him till just as he was leaving the room . Carrying his shoes in his hand , he went softly downstairs for he could see from the top of the flight that neither Alice nor her daughter was down yet , as the kitchen shutters were not unclosed . It was Mrs. Rose 's habit to rise early , and have all bright and clean against her lodgers came down ; but then , in general , she went to rest before nine o'clock , whereas the last night she had not gone till past twelve . Philip went about undoing the shutters , and trying to break up the raking coal , with as little noise as might be , for he had compassion on the tired sleepers . The kettle had not been filled , probably because Mrs. Rose had been unable to face the storm of the night before , in taking it to the pump just at the entrance of the court . When Philip came back from filling it , he found Alice and Hester both in the kitchen , and trying to make up for lost time by hastening over their work . Hester looked busy and notable with her gown pinned up behind her , and her hair all tucked away under a clean linen cap ; but Alice was angry with herself for her late sleeping , and that and other causes made her speak crossly to Philip , as he came in with his snowy feet and well - filled kettle .

75681	75970	75983	75983	she	2312	' had exhibited . But then he felt stirring within him a force of enduring love which he believed to be unusual , and which seemed as if it must compel all things to his wish in the end . A year or so ago he had thought much of his own cleverness and his painfully acquired learning , and he had imagined that these were the qualities which were to gain Sylvia . But now , whether he had tried them and had failed to win even her admiration , or whether some true instinct had told him that a woman 's love may be gained in many ways sooner than by mere learning , he was only angry with himself for his past folly in making himself her school -- nay , her taskmaster . To - night , though , he would start off on a new tack . He would not even upbraid her for her conduct the night before ; he had shown her his displeasure at the time ; but she should see how tender and forgiving he could be . He would lure her to him rather than find fault with her . There had perhaps been too much of that already . When Coulson came back Philip went to his solitary dinner . In general he was quite alone while eating it ; but to - day Alice Rose chose to bear him company . She watched him with cold severe eye for some time , until he had appeased his languid appetite . Then she began with the rebuke she had in store for him ; a rebuke the motives to which were not entirely revealed even to herself . '

He wished she would leave him alone ; but he only said--'I had nought but a slice o '

76866	76985	77067	77067	thou	2338	' And once more , after laying his hand with as much of a caress as was in his nature on hers , he left the house . Probably Alice would have considered the first words that greeted Philip on his entrance into the shop as an answer to her prayer , for they were such as put a stop to his plan of going to see Sylvia that evening ; and if Alice had formed her inchoate thoughts into words , Sylvia would have appeared as the nearest earthly representative of the spirit of temptation whom she dreaded for Philip . As he took his place behind the counter , Coulson said to him in a low voice,-- '
76997	77014	76986	76987	Jeremiah Foster	204	' him to - night . He says that he and John have a little matter o '
77022	77063	77067	77067	thou	2338	' A glance from his eyes to Philip told the latter that Coulson believed the business spoken of had something to do with the partnership , respecting which there had been a silent intelligence for some time between the shopmen . '
77070	77087	77132	77132	his	204	' asked Philip , doggedly unwilling , even yet , to give up his purposed visit . '
77127	77129	77132	77132	his	204	' t '
77135	77136	77137	77137	I	0	' '
77146	77212	77229	77229	I	0	' said Philip , feeling just then as if the long - hoped - for partnership was as nothing compared to his plan . It was always distasteful to him to have to give up a project , or to disarrange an intended order of things , such was his nature ; but to - day it was absolute pain to yield his own purpose . '
77218	77228	77229	77229	I	0	' said Coulson , in amaze at his reluctance . '
77238	78521	78534	78534	she	2342	' said Philip , weighing consequences , until called off to attend to customers . In the course of the afternoon , however , he felt himself more easy in deferring his visit to Haytersbank till the next evening . Charley Kinraid entered the shop , accompanied by Molly Brunton and her sisters ; and though they all went towards Hester 's side of the shop , and Philip and Coulson had many people to attend to , yet Hepburn 's sharpened ears caught much of what the young women were saying . From that he gathered that Kinraid had promised them new year 's gifts , for the purchase of which they were come ; and after a little more listening he learnt that Kinraid was returning to Shields the next day , having only come over to spend a holiday with his relations , and being tied with ship 's work at the other end . They all talked together lightly and merrily , as if his going or staying was almost a matter of indifference to himself and his cousins . The principal thought of the young women was to secure the articles they most fancied ; Charley Kinraid was ( so Philip thought ) especially anxious that the youngest and prettiest should be pleased . Hepburn watched him perpetually with a kind of envy of his bright , courteous manner , the natural gallantry of the sailor . If it were but clear that Sylvia took as little thought of him as he did of her , to all appearance , Philip could even have given him praise for manly good looks , and a certain kind of geniality of disposition which made him ready to smile pleasantly at all strangers , from babies upwards . As the party turned to leave the shop they saw Philip , the guest of the night before ; and they came over to shake hands with him across the counter ; Kinraid 's hand was proffered among the number . Last night Philip could not have believed it possible that such a demonstration of fellowship should have passed between them ; and perhaps there was a slight hesitation of manner on his part , for some idea or remembrance crossed Kinraid 's mind which brought a keen searching glance into the eyes which for a moment were fastened on Philip 's face . In spite of himself , and during the very action of hand - shaking , Philip felt a cloud come over his face , not altering or moving his features , but taking light and peace out of his countenance . Molly Brunton began to say something , and he gladly turned to look at her . She was asking him why he went away so early , for they had kept it up for four hours after he left , and last of all , she added ( turning to Kinraid ) , her cousin Charley had danced a hornpipe among the platters on the ground . Philip hardly knew what he said in reply , the mention of that pas seul lifted such a weight off his heart . He could smile now , after his grave fashion , and would have shaken hands again with Kinraid had it been required ; for it seemed to him that no one , caring ever so little in the way that he did for Sylvia , could have borne four mortal hours of a company where she had been , and was not ; least of all could have danced a hornpipe , either from gaiety of heart , or even out of complaisance . He felt as if the yearning after the absent one would have been a weight to his legs , as well as to his spirit ; and he imagined that all men were like himself . CHAPTER XIV PARTNERSHIP As darkness closed in , and the New Year 's throng became scarce , Philip 's hesitation about accompanying Coulson faded away . He was more comfortable respecting Sylvia , and his going to see her might be deferred ; and , after all , he felt that the wishes of his masters ought to be attended to , and the honour of an invitation to the private house of Jeremiah not to be slighted for anything short of a positive engagement . Besides , the ambitious man of business existed strongly in Philip . It would never do to slight advances towards the second great earthly object in his life ; one also on which the first depended . So when the shop was closed , the two set out down Bridge Street to cross the river to the house of Jeremiah Foster . They stood a moment on the bridge to breathe the keen fresh sea air after their busy day . The waters came down , swollen full and dark , with rapid rushing speed from the snow - fed springs high up on the moorland above . The close - packed houses in the old town seemed a cluster of white roofs irregularly piled against the more unbroken white of the hill - side . Lights twinkled here and there in the town , and were slung from stern and bow of the ships in the harbour . The air was very still , settling in for a frost ; so still that all distant sounds seemed near : the rumble of a returning cart in the High Street , the voices on board ship , the closing of shutters and barring of doors in the new town to which they were bound . But the sharp air was filled , as it were , with saline particles in a freezing state ; little pungent crystals of sea salt burning lips and cheeks with their cold keenness . It would not do to linger here in the very centre of the valley up which passed the current of atmosphere coming straight with the rushing tide from the icy northern seas . Besides , there was the unusual honour of a supper with Jeremiah Foster awaiting them . He had asked each of them separately to a meal before now ; but they had never gone together , and they felt that there was something serious in the conjuncture . They began to climb the steep heights leading to the freshly - built rows of the new town of Monkshaven , feeling as if they were rising into aristocratic regions where no shop profaned the streets . Jeremiah Foster 's house was one of six , undistinguished in size , or shape , or colour ; but noticed in the daytime by all passers - by for its spotless cleanliness of lintel and doorstep , window and window frame . The very bricks seemed as though they came in for the daily scrubbing which brightened handle , knocker , all down to the very scraper . The two young men felt as shy of the interview with their master under such unusual relations of guest and host , as a girl does of her first party . Each rather drew back from the decided step of knocking at the door ; but with a rebuffing shake at his own folly , Philip was the one to give a loud single rap . As if they had been waited for , the door flew open , and a middle - aged servant stood behind , as spotless and neat as the house itself ; and smiled a welcome to the familiar faces . '
78526	78532	78534	78534	she	2342	' a bit , William , '
78543	78548	78573	78573	yo'll	2341	' You 've been leanin '
78561	78572	78534	78534	she	2342	' continued she , turning him round with motherly freedom , '
78579	78584	78534	78534	she	2342	' your shoon a polishin '
78594	78596	78601	78601	Measter	2343	' t '
78607	79135	79137	79138	an Englishman	2344	' In the square parlour the same precise order was observed . Every article of furniture was free from speck of dirt or particle of dust ; and everything was placed either in a parallel line , or at exact right - angles with every other . Even John and Jeremiah sat in symmetry on opposite sides of the fire - place ; the very smiles on their honest faces seemed drawn to a line of exactitude . Such formality , however admirable , was not calculated to promote ease : it was not until after supper -- until a good quantity of Yorkshire pie had been swallowed , and washed down , too , with the best and most generous wine in Jeremiah 's cellar -- that there was the least geniality among them , in spite of the friendly kindness of the host and his brother . The long silence , during which mute thanks for the meal were given , having come to an end , Jeremiah called for pipes , and three of the party began to smoke . Politics in those days were tickle subjects to meddle with , even in the most private company . The nation was in a state of terror against France , and against any at home who might be supposed to sympathise with the enormities she had just been committing . The oppressive act against seditious meetings had been passed the year before ; and people were doubtful to what extremity of severity it might be construed . Even the law authorities forgot to be impartial , but either their alarms or their interests made too many of them vehement partisans instead of calm arbiters , and thus destroyed the popular confidence in what should have been considered the supreme tribunal of justice . Yet for all this , there were some who dared to speak of reform of Parliament , as a preliminary step to fair representation of the people , and to a reduction of the heavy war - taxation that was imminent , if not already imposed . But these pioneers of 1830 were generally obnoxious . The great body of the people gloried in being Tories and haters of the French , with whom they were on tenter - hooks to fight , almost unaware of the rising reputation of the young Corsican warrior , whose name would be used ere a dozen years had passed to hush English babies with a terror such as that of Marlborough once had for the French . At such a place as Monkshaven all these opinions were held in excess . One or two might , for the mere sake of argument , dispute on certain points of history or government ; but they took care to be very sure of their listeners before such arguments touched on anything of the present day ; for it had been not unfrequently found that the public duty of prosecuting opinions not your own overrode the private duty of respecting confidence . Most of the Monkshaven politicians confined themselves , therefore , to such general questions as these : '
79148	79149	79137	79138	an Englishman	2344	' '
79176	79177	79208	79208	Elizabeth	256	' '
79210	79417	79208	79208	Elizabeth	256	' The Fosters were quite secure enough of their guests this evening to have spoken freely on politics had they been so inclined . And they did begin on the outrages which had been lately offered to the king in crossing St James 's Park to go and open the House of Lords ; but soon , so accustomed were their minds to caution and restraint , the talk dropped down to the high price of provisions . Bread at 1_s _ . 3_d _ . the quartern loaf , according to the London test . Wheat at 120_s _ . per quarter , as the home - baking northerners viewed the matter ; and then the conversation died away to an ominous silence . John looked at Jeremiah , as if asking him to begin . Jeremiah was the host , and had been a married man . Jeremiah returned the look with the same meaning in it . John , though a bachelor , was the elder brother . The great church bell , brought from the Monkshaven monastery centuries ago , high up on the opposite hill - side , began to ring nine o'clock ; it was getting late . Jeremiah began : '
79431	79509	79800	79801	John Foster	205	' prices and taxes and bread so dear ; but John and I are getting into years , and we 've no children to follow us : yet we would fain draw out of some of our worldly affairs . We would like to give up the shop , and stick to banking , to which there seemeth a plain path . But first there is the stock and goodwill of the shop to be disposed on . '
79807	79845	79853	79853	Philip	191	' The stock and goodwill ! That would take much wealth . And there will be fixtures to be considered . Philip , canst thee tell me the exact amount of stock in the shop at present ? '
79859	79862	79853	79853	Philip	191	' ends . '
79878	79958	79853	79853	Philip	191	' Coulson looked at him in a little dismay , and could not repress a sigh . The figures put into words and spoken aloud seemed to indicate so much larger an amount of money than when quickly written down in numerals . But Philip read the countenances , nay , by some process of which he was not himself aware , he read the minds of the brothers , and felt no dismay at what he saw there . '
79963	79968	79853	79853	Philip	191	' asked John Foster . '
80015	80016	79853	79853	Philip	191	' '
80032	80054	79853	79853	Philip	191	' said Philip . Coulson had done the sum quicker , but was too much disheartened by the amount to speak . '
80059	80065	80075	80075	I	0	' asked the pitiless John . '

80314	80341	80374	80374	Philip	191	' said John , and again they were silent . Half - past nine struck . It was time to be beginning to make an end . '

80376	80407	80408	80408	Coulson	207	' There 's no one who can put forwards a penny for me : I have but few kin , and they have little to spare beyond what they need . '
80410	80420	80430	80430	John	214	' My father and mother have nine on us . '
80421	80428	80408	80408	Coulson	207	' Let alone , let alone ! '
80448	80467	80408	80408	Coulson	207	' Brother , I think we have enough of this world 's goods to do what we like wi '
80471	80497	80534	80534	I	0	' Jeremiah was a little scandalized at the rapid melting away of assumed character , and took a good pull at his pipe before he replied-- '

80550	80554	80559	80559	thee	214	' replied Jeremiah , '

80796	80843	80792	80794	a Cousin Betty	2389	' They all four shook hands round with the same heartiness as if it had been a legal ceremony necessary to the completion of the partnership . The old men 's faces were bright with smiles ; the eyes of the young ones sparkled with hope . '
80849	80853	80890	80890	He	0	' said Jeremiah , '

81126	81138	81117	81118	the Lord	5574	' said Jeremiah , putting down his paper for a minute . '
81141	81155	81176	81176	We	2390	' said John , shaking his head to give effect to his word . '
81163	81175	81216	81216	yo	2397	' continued Jeremiah , beginning afresh to refer to his paper : '

81435	81627	81641	81641	his	0	' The plan had , in all its details , been carefully arranged by the two brothers . They were afraid lest Hepburn and Coulson should be dazzled by the amount of profits , and had so arranged the sliding - scale of payment as to reduce the first year 's income to what the elder men thought a very moderate sum , but what to the younger ones appeared an amount of wealth such as they , who had neither of them ever owned much more than fifty pounds , considered almost inexhaustible . It was certainly a remarkable instance of prosperity and desert meeting together so early in life . For a moment or two the brothers were disappointed at not hearing any reply from either of them . Then Philip stood up , for he felt as if anything he could say sitting down would not be sufficiently expressive of gratitude , and William instantly followed his example . Hepburn began in a formal manner , something the way in which he had read in the York newspapers that honourable members returned thanks when their health was given . '
81634	81640	81727	81727	Philip	191	' ( Coulson nudged him ) '

82094	82213	82294	82294	Jeremiah	204	' Coulson immediately gave the promise . Philip 's assent came lagging . He had thought of Sylvia living , almost as much as of the dead mother , whose last words had been a committal of her child to the Father of the friendless ; and now that a short delay was placed between the sight of the cup and his enjoyment of it , there was an impatient chafing in the mind of the composed and self - restrained Philip ; and then repentance quick as lightning effaced the feeling , and he pledged himself to the secrecy which was enjoined .

83883	83923	83938	83938	He	328	' said Sylvia , hanging down her head a little , wondering if he could have heard the way in which she and Kester had been talking , and thinking over her little foolish jokes with anger against herself . '

But she would have been extremely disappointed if he had . Kinraid himself seemed to have no thought of the kind . He saw with his quick eyes , not unaccustomed to women , that his coming so unexpectedly had fluttered Sylvia , and anxious to make her quite at her ease with him , and not unwilling to conciliate Kester , he addressed his next speech to him , with the same kind of air of interest in the old man 's pursuit that a young man of a different class sometimes puts on when talking to the chaperone of a pretty girl in a ball - room .

Sylvia was knitting away vigorously , thinking all the while that it was a great pity she had not put on a better gown , or even a cap with brighter ribbon , and quite unconscious how very pretty she looked standing against the faint light , her head a little bent down ; her hair catching bright golden touches , as it fell from under her little linen cap ; her pink bed - gown , confined by her apron - string , giving a sort of easy grace to her figure ; her dark full linsey petticoat short above her trim ancles , looking far more suitable to the place where she was standing than her long gown of the night before would have done . Kinraid was wanting to talk to her , and to make her talk , but was uncertain how to begin . In the meantime Kester went on with the subject last spoken about . '

84793	84985	84995	84995	he	2462	' There was a good deal meant and understood by these last few words . The tone in which they were spoken gave them a tender intensity not lost upon either of the hearers . Kester cocked his eye once more , but with as little obtrusiveness as he could , and pondered the sailor 's looks and ways . He remembered his coming about the place the winter before , and how the old master had then appeared to have taken to him ; but at that time Sylvia had seemed to Kester too little removed from a child to have either art or part in Kinraid 's visits ; now , however , the case was different . Kester in his sphere -- among his circle of acquaintance , narrow though it was -- had heard with much pride of Sylvia 's bearing away the bell at church and at market , wherever girls of her age were congregated . He was a north countryman , so he gave out no further sign of his feelings than his mistress and Sylvia 's mother had done on a like occasion . '
84987	84993	85050	85051	Philip Hepburn	191	' lass is weel enough , '

85430	85525	85526	85526	She	188	' And along the wall , round the corner , down the round slippery stones of the rambling farmyard , behind the buildings , did Sylvia trip , safe and well - poised , though the ground wore all one coating of white snow , and in many places was so slippery as to oblige Kinraid to linger near Kester , the lantern - bearer . Kester did not lose his opportunity , though the cold misty night air provoked his asthmatic cough when - ever he breathed , and often interrupted his words . '
85547	85575	85748	85748	he	202	' that 's summat , whether in a cow or a woman . A've known her from a baby ; she 's a reet down good un . '

In his haste to help her , Charley took up one of the pails . '

85989	86019	86028	86028	yo	2485	' said Kinraid ; but she had returned to her own pail , and seemed not to hear him . He followed her to her side of the dairy . '

86288	86391	86405	86405	She	2489	' She wished she could go on talking , but could not think of anything more to say just then ; for , in the middle of her sentence , the flattering interpretation he might put upon her words , on her knowing so exactly the number of times he had been to Haytersbank , flashed upon her , and she wanted to lead the conversation a little farther afield -- to make it a little less personal . This was not his wish , however . In a tone which thrilled through her , even in her own despite , he said,-- '
86394	86404	86429	86429	she	2489	' think that can ever happen again , Sylvia ? '
86432	86450	86413	86413	He	2490	' What happen again ? Let me go , I dunno what yo're talking about , and I 'm

86735	86862	86863	86863	Sylvia	188	' Perhaps the fresh voices breaking on the silence,--perhaps the tones were less modulated than they had been before , but anyhow Bell Robson 's voice was heard calling Sylvia through the second door , which opened from the dairy to the house - place , in which her mother had been till this moment asleep . Sylvia darted off in obedience to the call ; glad to leave him , as at the moment Kinraid resentfully imagined . Through the open door he heard the conversation between mother and daughter , almost unconscious of its meaning , so difficult did he find it to wrench his thoughts from the ideas he had just been forming with Sylvia 's bright lovely face right under his eyes .

His sailor 's life , in bringing him suddenly face to face with unexpected events , had given him something of that self - possession which we consider the attribute of a gentleman ; and with an apparent calmness which almost disappointed Sylvia , who construed it into a symptom of indifference as to whether he went or stayed , he bade her mother good - night , and only said , in holding her hand a minute longer than was absolutely necessary,-- '

88964	89365	89645	89646	Jeremiah Foster	204	' word for every statement the brothers had made on new year 's day ; but this , it was evident , would not have satisfied their masters , who were scrupulous in insisting that whatever advantage there was should always fall on the side of the younger men . When Philip saw Sylvia she was always quiet and gentle ; perhaps more silent than she had been a year ago , and she did not attend so briskly to what was passing around her . She was rather thinner and paler ; but whatever change there was in her was always an improvement in Philip 's eyes , so long as she spoke graciously to him . He thought she was suffering from long - continued anxiety about her mother , or that she had too much to do ; and either cause was enough to make him treat her with a grave regard and deference which had a repressed tenderness in it , of which she , otherwise occupied , was quite unaware . She liked him better , too , than she had done a year or two before , because he did not show her any of the eager attention which teased her then , although its meaning was not fully understood . Things were much in this state when the frost broke , and milder weather succeeded . This was the time so long looked forward to by the invalid and her friends , as favouring the doctor 's recommendation of change of air . Her husband was to take her to spend a fortnight with a kindly neighbour , who lived near the farm they had occupied , forty miles or so inland , before they came to Haytersbank . The widow - woman was to come and stay in the house , to keep Sylvia company , during her mother 's absence . Daniel , indeed , was to return home after conveying his wife to her destination ; but there was so much to be done on the land at this time of the year , that Sylvia would have been alone all day had it not been for the arrangement just mentioned . There was active stirring in Monkshaven harbour as well as on shore . The whalers were finishing their fittings - out for the Greenland seas . It was a '
89367	89626	89746	89746	Coulson	207	' season , that is to say , there would be difficulty in passing the barrier of ice which lay between the ships and the whaling - grounds ; and yet these must be reached before June , or the year 's expedition would be of little avail . Every blacksmith 's shop rung with the rhythmical clang of busy hammers , beating out old iron , such as horseshoes , nails or stubs , into the great harpoons ; the quays were thronged with busy and important sailors , rushing hither and thither , conscious of the demand in which they were held at this season of the year . It was war time , too . Many captains unable to procure men in Monkshaven would have to complete their crews in the Shetlands . The shops in the town were equally busy ; stores had to be purchased by the whaling - masters , warm clothing of all sorts to be provided . These were the larger wholesale orders ; but many a man , and woman , too , brought out their small hoards to purchase extra comforts , or precious keepsakes for some beloved one . It was the time of the great half - yearly traffic of the place ; another impetus was given to business when the whalers returned in the autumn , and the men were flush of money , and full of delight at once more seeing their homes and their friends . There was much to be done in Fosters '

90352	90395	90346	90346	Kinraid	202	' love , this fault of his was one with which the two grave , sedate young men had no sympathy . Their hearts were true and constant , whatever else might be their failings ; and it is no new thing to '
90405	90648	90990	90990	I	0	' Philip wished that it was not so late , or that very evening he would have gone to keep guard over Sylvia in her mother 's absence -- nay , perhaps he might have seen reason to give her a warning of some kind . But , if he had done so , it would have been locking the stable - door after the steed was stolen . Kinraid had turned his steps towards Haytersbank Farm as soon as ever he had completed his purchases . He had only come that afternoon to Monkshaven , and for the sole purpose of seeing Sylvia once more before he went to fulfil his engagement as specksioneer in the _ Urania _ , a whaling - vessel that was to sail from North Shields on Thursday morning , and this was Monday . Sylvia sat in the house - place , her back to the long low window , in order to have all the light the afternoon hour afforded for her work . A basket of her father 's unmended stockings was on the little round table beside her , and one was on her left hand , which she supposed herself to be mending ; but from time to time she made long pauses , and looked in the fire ; and yet there was but little motion of flame or light in it out of which to conjure visions . It was '
90651	90989	91044	91044	she	2553	' for the afternoon ; covered with a black mass of coal , over which the equally black kettle hung on the crook . In the back - kitchen Dolly Reid , Sylvia 's assistant during her mother 's absence , chanted a lugubrious ditty , befitting her condition as a widow , while she cleaned tins , and cans , and milking - pails . Perhaps these bustling sounds prevented Sylvia from hearing approaching footsteps coming down the brow with swift advance ; at any rate , she started and suddenly stood up as some one entered the open door . It was strange she should be so much startled , for the person who entered had been in her thoughts all during those long pauses . Charley Kinraid and the story of crazy Nancy had been the subjects for her dreams for many a day , and many a night . Now he stood there , bright and handsome as ever , with just that much timidity in his face , that anxiety as to his welcome , which gave his accost an added charm , could she but have perceived it . But she was so afraid of herself , so unwilling to show what she felt , and how much she had been thinking of him in his absence , that her reception seemed cold and still . She did not come forward to meet him ; she went crimson to the very roots of her hair ; but that , in the waning light , he could not see ; and she shook so that she felt as if she could hardly stand ; but the tremor was not visible to him . She wondered if he remembered the kiss that had passed between them on new year 's eve -- the words that had been spoken in the dairy on new year 's day ; the tones , the looks , that had accompanied those words . But all she said was-- '
90997	91003	91008	91008	I	0	' . I thought yo'd ha '

91360	91418	91463	91463	he	202	' said she , in a low , almost inaudible tone . Then hardening herself , and resolving to speak as if she did not understand his only half - expressed meaning , she lifted up her head , and all but looking at him -- while she wrenched her hand out of his -- she said : '

Dolly Reid came in , and went out softly , unheeded by them . But Sylvia 's listening ears caught her father 's voice , as he and Kester returned homewards from their day 's work in the plough - field ; and she started away , and fled upstairs in shy affright , leaving Charley to explain his presence in the solitary kitchen to her father . He came in , not seeing that any one was there at first ; for they had never thought of lighting a candle . Kinraid stepped forward into the firelight ; his purpose of concealing what he had said to Sylvia quite melted away by the cordial welcome her father gave him the instant that he recognized him . '

Philip paid no attention to this half - uttered sentence ; he was eager to tell Coulson , as far as he could do so without betraying his master 's secret , how many drawbacks there were to his proposed journey , in the responsibility which it involved , and his unwillingness to leave Monkshaven : he said-- '
95776	95793	95794	95794	thee	2671	'm pleased at the thought on't . But , if I could I 'd change places wi '

95875	95881	95914	95914	thou	2671	' said Philip , rising , '

95972	96048	96054	96054	Hester	209	' He took his cap and was gone , not heeding Alice 's shrill inquiry as to his clothes and his ruffled shirt . Coulson sat still , penitent and ashamed ; at length he stole a look at Hester . She was playing with her teaspoon , but he could see that she was choking down her tears ; he could not choose but force her to speak with an ill - timed question . '
96056	96085	96094	96094	Coulson	207	' said he . She lifted up those eyes , usually so soft and serene ; now they were full of the light of indignation shining through tears . '

He would speak to her of his passionate attachment , before he left , for an uncertain length of time , and the certain distance of London . And all the modification on this point which his judgment could obtain from his impetuous and excited heart was , that he would watch her words and manner well when he announced his approaching absence , and if in them he read the slightest token of tender regretful feeling , he would pour out his love at her feet , not even urging the young girl to make any return , or to express the feelings of which he hoped the germ was already budding in her . He would be patient with her ; he could not be patient himself . His heart beating , his busy mind rehearsing the probable coming scene , he turned into the field - path that led to Haytersbank . Coming along it , and so meeting him , advanced Daniel Robson , in earnest talk with Charley Kinraid . Kinraid , then , had been at the farm : Kinraid had been seeing Sylvia , her mother away . The thought of poor dead Annie Coulson flashed into Philip 's mind . Could he be playing the same game with Sylvia ? Philip set his teeth and tightened his lips at the thought of it . They had stopped talking ; they had seen him already , or his impulse would have been to dodge behind the wall and avoid them ; even though one of his purposes in going to Haytersbank had been to bid his uncle farewell . Kinraid took him by surprise from the hearty greeting he gave him , and which Philip would fain have avoided . But the specksioneer was full of kindliness towards all the world , especially towards all Sylvia 's friends , and , convinced of her great love towards himself , had forgotten any previous jealousy of Philip . Secure and exultant , his broad , handsome , weather - bronzed face was as great a contrast to Philip 's long , thoughtful , sallow countenance , as his frank manner was to the other 's cold reserve . It was some minutes before Hepburn could bring himself to tell the great event that was about to befall him before this third person whom he considered as an intrusive stranger . But as Kinraid seemed to have no idea of going on , and as there really was no reason why he and all the world should not know of Philip 's intentions , he told his uncle that he was bound for London the next day on business connected with the Fosters . Daniel was deeply struck with the fact that he was talking to a man setting off for London at a day 's notice . '

He could hear her feet pacing quickly about through the unceiled rafters . He sate still in despair , his head buried in his two hands . He sate till it grew dusk , dark ; the wood fire , not gathered together by careful hands , died out into gray ashes . Dolly Reid had done her work and gone home . There were but Philip and Sylvia in the house . He knew he ought to be going home , for he had much to do , and many arrangements to make . Yet it seemed as though he could not stir . At length he raised his stiffened body , and stood up , dizzy . Up the little wooden stairs he went , where he had never been before , to the small square landing , almost filled up with the great chest for oat - cake . He breathed hard for a minute , and then knocked at the door of Sylvia 's room . '

100404	100410	101282	101282	God	240	' Norroway over the foam . '
100733	101279	101293	101293	God	240	' house , and skirting the walls till they came to the little slender path down to the shore . But by the farm , by the very house - door they must of necessity pass . Philip slackened his pace , keeping under the shadow of the rock . By - and - by Kinraid , walking on the sunlight open sands , turned round and looked long and earnestly towards Haytersbank gully . Hepburn paused when he paused , but as intently as he looked at some object above , so intently did Hepburn look at him . No need to ascertain by sight towards whom his looks , his thoughts were directed . He took off his hat and waved it , touching one part of it as if with particular meaning . When he turned away at last , Hepburn heaved a heavy sigh , and crept yet more into the cold dank shadow of the cliffs . Each step was now a heavy task , his sad heart tired and weary . After a while he climbed up a few feet , so as to mingle his form yet more completely with the stones and rocks around . Stumbling over the uneven and often jagged points , slipping on the sea - weed , plunging into little pools of water left by the ebbing tide in some natural basins , he yet kept his eyes fixed as if in fascination on Kinraid , and made his way almost alongside of him . But the last hour had pinched Hepburn 's features into something of the wan haggardness they would wear when he should first be lying still for ever . And now the two men were drawing near a creek , about eight miles from Monkshaven . The creek was formed by a beck ( or small stream ) that came flowing down from the moors , and took its way to the sea between the widening rocks . The melting of the snows and running of the flooded water - springs above made this beck in the early spring - time both deep and wide . Hepburn knew that here they both must take a path leading inland to a narrow foot - bridge about a quarter of a mile up the stream ; indeed from this point , owing to the jutting out of the rocks , the land path was the shortest ; and this way lay by the water - side at an angle right below the cliff to which Hepburn 's steps were leading him . He knew that on this long level field path he might easily be seen by any one following ; nay , if he followed any one at a short distance , for it was full of turnings ; and he resolved , late as he was , to sit down for a while till Kinraid was far enough in advance for him to escape being seen . He came up to the last rock behind which he could be concealed ; seven or eight feet above the stream he stood , and looked cautiously for the specksioneer . Up by the rushing stream he looked , then right below . '
101286	101290	101293	101293	God	240	' he murmured . '
101297	101406	101599	101599	Avast	341	' He crouched down where he had been standing and covered his face with his hands . He tried to deafen as well as to blind himself , that he might neither hear nor see anything of the coming event of which he , an inhabitant of Monkshaven at that day , well understood the betokening signs . Kinraid had taken the larger angle of the sands before turning up towards the bridge . He came along now nearing the rocks . By this time he was sufficiently buoyant to whistle to himself . It steeled Philip 's heart to what was coming to hear his rival whistling , '
101413	101454	101456	101457	the King	832	' so soon after parting with Sylvia . The instant Kinraid turned the corner of the cliff , the ambush was upon him . Four man - of - war 's men sprang on him and strove to pinion him . '
101461	101598	101601	101601	I	0	' cried they , with rough , triumphant jeers . Their boat was moored not a dozen yards above ; they were sent by the tender of a frigate lying off Hartlepool for fresh water . The tender was at anchor just beyond the jutting rocks in face . They knew that fishermen were in the habit of going to and from their nets by the side of the creek ; but such a prize as this active , strong , and evidently superior sailor , was what they had not hoped for , and their endeavours to secure him were in proportion to the value of the prize . Although taken by surprise , and attacked by so many , Kinraid did not lose his wits . He wrenched himself free , crying out loud : '
101602	101620	101738	101738	your	0	'm a protected whaler . I claim my protection . I 've my papers to show , I 'm
101637	101734	101755	101756	his Majesty	665	' As a protected whaler , the press - gang had , by the 17th section of Act 26 Geo . III . no legal right to seize him , unless he had failed to return to his ship by the 10th March following the date of his bond . But of what use were the papers he hastily dragged out of his breast ; of what use were laws in those days of slow intercourse with such as were powerful enough to protect , and in the time of popular panic against a French invasion ? '
101741	101751	101798	101798	Thou	2767	' cried the leader of the press - gang ; '
101765	101766	101881	101883	a very devil	2768	' '
101771	101797	101881	101883	a very devil	2768	' said the specksioneer , with a motion of his hand , which the swift - eyed sailor opposed to him saw and interpreted rightly . '
101815	101879	102508	102508	lad	1139	' In a minute his cutlass was forced from him , and it became a hand - to - hand struggle , of which , from the difference in numbers , it was not difficult to foretell the result . Yet Kinraid made desperate efforts to free himself ; he wasted no breath in words , but fought , as the men said , '
101885	102504	102608	102608	Hepburn	191	' Hepburn heard loud pants of breath , great thuds , the dull struggle of limbs on the sand , the growling curses of those who thought to have managed their affair more easily ; the sudden cry of some one wounded , not Kinraid he knew , Kinraid would have borne any pain in silence at such a moment ; another wrestling , swearing , infuriated strife , and then a strange silence . Hepburn sickened at the heart ; was then his rival dead ? had he left this bright world ? lost his life -- his love ? For an instant Hepburn felt guilty of his death ; he said to himself he had never wished him dead , and yet in the struggle he had kept aloof , and now it might be too late for ever . Philip could not bear the suspense ; he looked stealthily round the corner of the rock behind which he had been hidden , and saw that they had overpowered Kinraid , and , too exhausted to speak , were binding him hand and foot to carry him to their boat . Kinraid lay as still as any hedgehog : he rolled when they pushed him ; he suffered himself to be dragged without any resistance , any motion ; the strong colour brought into his face while fighting was gone now , his countenance was livid pale ; his lips were tightly held together , as if it cost him more effort to be passive , wooden , and stiff in their hands than it had done to fight and struggle with all his might . His eyes seemed the only part about him that showed cognizance of what was going on . They were watchful , vivid , fierce as those of a wild cat brought to bay , seeking in its desperate quickened brain for some mode of escape not yet visible , and in all probability never to become visible to the hopeless creature in its supreme agony . Without a motion of his head , he was perceiving and taking in everything while he lay bound at the bottom of the boat . A sailor sat by his side , who had been hurt by a blow from him . The man held his head in his hand , moaning ; but every now and then he revenged himself by a kick at the prostrate specksioneer , till even his comrades stopped their cursing and swearing at their prisoner for the trouble he had given them , to cry shame on their comrade . But Kinraid never spoke , nor shrank from the outstretched foot . One of his captors , with the successful insolence of victory , ventured to jeer him on the supposed reason for his vehement and hopeless resistance . He might have said yet more insolent things ; the kicks might have hit harder ; Kinraid did not hear or heed . His soul was beating itself against the bars of inflexible circumstance ; reviewing in one terrible instant of time what had been , what might have been , what was . Yet while these thoughts thus stabbed him , he was still mechanically looking out for chances . He moved his head a little , so as to turn towards Haytersbank , where Sylvia must be quickly , if sadly , going about her simple daily work ; and then his quick eye caught Hepburn 's face , blanched with excitement rather than fear , watching eagerly from behind the rock , where he had sat breathless during the affray and the impressment of his rival . '
102510	102604	102654	102654	I	0	' shouted the specksioneer as soon as he saw Philip , heaving and writhing his body the while with so much vigour that the sailors started away from the work they were engaged in about the boat , and held him down once more , as if afraid he should break the strong rope that held him like withes of green flax . But the bound man had no such notion in his head . His mighty wish was to call Hepburn near that he might send some message by him to Sylvia . '
102610	102635	102661	102661	Philip	191	' he cried again , falling back this time so weak and exhausted that the man - of - war 's men became sympathetic . '
102648	102653	102661	102661	Philip	191	' they called out . '
102655	102659	102661	102661	Philip	191	'm not afeared , '
102663	102665	102678	102678	yo	2771	' I 'm

102679	102703	102747	102747	I	0	' any right to take that fellow ; he 's a Greenland specksioneer , under protection , as I know and can testify . '
102704	102706	102783	102784	Billy Taylor	306	' Yo '
102753	102759	102783	102784	Billy Taylor	306	' went on the speaker , '
102789	102858	102906	102906	Yo'd	343	' Philip was coming towards them slowly , not from want of activity , but because he was undecided what he should be called upon to do or to say by the man whom he hated and dreaded , yet whom just now he could not help admiring . Kinraid groaned with impatience at seeing one , free to move with quick decision , so slow and dilatory . '
102863	102868	102906	102906	Yo'd	343	' cried the sailors , '
102904	102905	102939	102939	His	2773	' '
102914	102920	103101	103102	Yon fellow	2787	' said Kinraid , grimly . '
102937	102938	103121	103121	you	2788	' '
102958	103100	103385	103385	her	2794	' replied the leader of the gang , eyeing Philip nevertheless , and questioning within himself how far , with only two other available men , they durst venture on his capture as well as the specksioneer 's . It might be done , he thought , even though there was this powerful captive aboard , and the boat to manage too ; but , running his eye over Philip 's figure , he decided that the tall stooping fellow was never cut out for a sailor , and that he should get small thanks if he captured him , to pay him for the possible risk of losing the other . Or else the mere fact of being a landsman was of as little consequence to the press - gang , as the protecting papers which Kinraid had vainly showed . '
103123	103211	103409	103409	Hepburn	191	' said he , catching Hepburn by the shoulder , and giving him a push . Philip stumbled over something in this , his forced run . He looked down ; his foot had caught in Kinraid 's hat , which had dropped off in the previous struggle . In the band that went round the low crown , a ribbon was knotted ; a piece of that same ribbon which Philip had chosen out , with such tender hope , to give to Sylvia for the Corneys '
103397	103401	103455	103455	Sylvia	188	' What do yo '
103404	103407	103455	103455	Sylvia	188	' me ? '
103442	103453	103484	103484	yo've	2798	' nudges , and winks , and jests among themselves . '
103457	103460	103505	103505	you	2800	' said Kinraid---- '
103470	103482	103516	103516	I	0	' exclaimed one of the men ; but Kinraid went straight on,-- '
103497	103498	103570	103570	she	188	' '
103517	103521	103649	103649	her	188	'm sure . We 're
103577	103647	103731	103731	her	188	' One of the sailors laughed at this rude humour ; another bade Carter hold his stupid tongue . Philip hated him in his heart . Kinraid hardly heard him . He was growing faint with the heavy blows he had received , the stunning fall he had met with , and the reaction from his dogged self - control at first . Philip did not speak nor move . '
103651	103661	103731	103731	her	188	' continued Kinraid , rousing himself for another effort , '
103709	103715	103735	103735	I	0	' Philip said something inarticulately . '
103718	103722	103755	103755	Yo'll	0	' cried Carter , '
103753	103754	103842	103842	Hepburn	191	' '
103763	103794	103755	103755	Yo'll	0	' muttered Philip , his passion boiling over at the thought of having been chosen out from among all men to convey such a message as Kinraid 's to Sylvia . '
103809	103841	103755	103755	Yo'll	0	' said the man who had been hurt by Kinraid , and who had sate apart and silent till now . Philip turned away ; Kinraid raised himself and cried after him,-- '
103848	103953	103755	103755	Yo'll	0	' what he added Philip could not hear , for the words were lost before they reached him in the outward noise of the regular splash of the oars and the rush of the wind down the gully , with which mingled the closer sound that filled his ears of his own hurrying blood surging up into his brain . He was conscious that he had said something in reply to Kinraid 's adjuration that he would deliver his message to Sylvia , at the very time when Carter had stung him into fresh anger by the allusion to the possibility of the specksioneer 's '
103959	104112	104473	104473	my	0	' for , for an instant , Hepburn had been touched by the contrast of circumstances . Kinraid an hour or two ago,--Kinraid a banished man ; for in those days , an impressed sailor might linger out years on some foreign station , far from those he loved , who all this time remained ignorant of his cruel fate . But Hepburn began to wonder what he himself had said -- how much of a promise he had made to deliver those last passionate words of Kinraid 's . He could not recollect how much , how little he had said ; he knew he had spoken hoarsely and low almost at the same time as Carter had uttered his loud joke . But he doubted if Kinraid had caught his words . And then the dread Inner Creature , who lurks in each of our hearts , arose and said , '
104141	104460	104478	104478	God	240	' At a sudden impulse , he turned again towards the shore when he had crossed the bridge , and almost ran towards the verge of the land . Then he threw himself down on the soft fine turf that grew on the margin of the cliffs overhanging the sea , and commanding an extent of view towards the north . His face supported by his hands , he looked down upon the blue rippling ocean , flashing here and there , into the sunlight in long , glittering lines . The boat was still in the distance , making her swift silent way with long regular bounds to the tender that lay in the offing . Hepburn felt insecure , as in a nightmare dream , so long as the boat did not reach her immediate destination . His contracted eyes could see four minute figures rowing with ceaseless motion , and a fifth sate at the helm . But he knew there was a sixth , unseen , lying , bound and helpless , at the bottom of the boat ; and his fancy kept expecting this man to start up and break his bonds , and overcome all the others , and return to the shore free and triumphant . It was by no fault of Hepburn 's that the boat sped well away ; that she was now alongside the tender , dancing on the waves ; now emptied of her crew ; now hoisted up to her place . No fault of his ! and yet it took him some time before he could reason himself into the belief that his mad , feverish wishes not an hour before -- his wild prayer to be rid of his rival , as he himself had scrambled onward over the rocks alongside of Kinraid 's path on the sands -- had not compelled the event . '
104463	104472	105289	105290	the sailors	1435	' thought he , as he rose up , '
104482	105000	107646	107647	a man	5486	' Once more he looked out towards the ship . She had spread her beautiful great sails , and was standing out to sea in the glittering path of the descending sun . He saw that he had been delayed on his road , and had lingered long . He shook his stiffened limbs , shouldered his knapsack , and prepared to walk on to Hartlepool as swiftly as he could . CHAPTER XIX AN IMPORTANT MISSION Philip was too late for the coach he had hoped to go by , but there was another that left at night , and which reached Newcastle in the forenoon , so that , by the loss of a night 's sleep , he might overtake his lost time . But , restless and miserable , he could not stop in Hartlepool longer than to get some hasty food at the inn from which the coach started . He acquainted himself with the names of the towns through which it would pass , and the inns at which it would stop , and left word that the coachman was to be on the look - out for him and pick him up at some one of these places . He was thoroughly worn out before this happened -- too much tired to gain any sleep in the coach . When he reached Newcastle , he went to engage his passage in the next London - bound smack , and then directed his steps to Robinson 's , in the Side , to make all the inquiries he could think of respecting the plough his uncle wanted to know about . So it was pretty late in the afternoon , indeed almost evening , before he arrived at the small inn on the quay - side , where he intended to sleep . It was but a rough kind of place , frequented principally by sailors ; he had been recommended to it by Daniel Robson , who had known it well in former days . The accommodation in it was , however , clean and homely , and the people keeping it were respectable enough in their way . Still Hepburn was rather repelled by the appearance of the sailors who sate drinking in the bar , and he asked , in a low voice , if there was not another room . The woman stared in surprise , and only shook her head . Hepburn went to a separate table , away from the roaring fire , which on this cold March evening was the great attraction , and called for food and drink . Then seeing that the other men were eyeing him with the sociable idea of speaking to him , he asked for pen and ink and paper , with the intention of defeating their purpose by pre - occupation on his part . But when the paper came , the new pen , the unused thickened ink , he hesitated long before he began to write ; and at last he slowly put down the words,-- '
105291	105374	108085	108085	He	191	' talk at the other end of the room , which made him listen to their words . They were speaking of that very Kinraid , the thought of whom filled his own mind like an actual presence . In a rough , careless way they spoke of the specksioneer , with admiration enough for his powers as a sailor and harpooner ; and from that they passed on to jesting mention of his power amongst women , and one or two girls '
107204	107643	108549	108549	thou'rt	2890	' parlour , he was unwilling to go to Haytersbank Farm . It was late , it is true , but on a May evening even country people keep up till eight or nine o'clock . Perhaps it was because Hepburn was still in his travel - stained dress ; having gone straight to the shop on his arrival in Monkshaven . Perhaps it was because , if he went this night for the short half - hour intervening before bed - time , he would have no excuse for paying a longer visit on the following evening . At any rate , he proceeded straight to Alice Rose 's , as soon as he had finished his interview with his employers . Both Hester and Coulson had given him their welcome home in the shop , which they had , however , left an hour or two before him . Yet they gave him a fresh greeting , almost one in which surprise was blended , when he came to his lodgings . Even Alice seemed gratified by his spending this first evening with them , as if she had thought it might have been otherwise . Weary though he was , he exerted himself to talk and to relate what he had done and seen in London , as far as he could without breaking confidence with his employers . It was something to see the pleasure he gave to his auditors , although there were several mixed feelings in their minds to produce the expression of it which gratified him . Coulson was sorry for his former ungenerous reception of the news that Philip was going to London ; Hester and her mother each secretly began to feel as if this evening was like more happy evenings of old , before the Robsons came to Haytersbank Farm ; and who knows what faint delicious hopes this resemblance may not have suggested ? While Philip , restless and excited , feeling that he could not sleep , was glad to pass away the waking hours that must intervene before to - morrow night , at times , he tried to make them talk of what had happened in Monkshaven during his absence , but all had gone on in an eventless manner , as far as he could gather ; if they knew of anything affecting the Robsons , they avoided speaking of it to him ; and , indeed , how little likely were they ever to have heard their names while he was away ? CHAPTER XX LOVED AND LOST Philip walked towards the Robsons '
108105	108544	108549	108549	thou'rt	2890	' door . She was out of doors , in the garden , which , at some distance from the house , sloped up the bank on the opposite side of the gully ; much too far off to be spoken to -- not too far off to be gazed at by eyes that caressed her every movement . How well Philip knew that garden ; placed long ago by some tenant of the farm on a southern slope ; walled in with rough moorland stones ; planted with berry - bushes for use , and southernwood and sweet - briar for sweetness of smell . When the Robsons had first come to Haytersbank , and Sylvia was scarcely more than a pretty child , how well he remembered helping her with the arrangement of this garden ; laying out his few spare pence in hen - and - chicken daisies at one time , in flower - seeds at another ; again in a rose - tree in a pot . He knew how his unaccustomed hands had laboured with the spade at forming a little primitive bridge over the beck in the hollow before winter streams should make it too deep for fording ; how he had cut down branches of the mountain - ash and covered them over , yet decked with their scarlet berries , with sods of green turf , beyond which the brilliancy crept out ; but now it was months and years since he had been in that garden , which had lost its charm for Sylvia , as she found the bleak sea - winds came up and blighted all endeavours at cultivating more than the most useful things -- pot - herbs , marigolds , potatoes , onions , and such - like . Why did she tarry there now , standing quite motionless up by the highest bit of wall , looking over the sea , with her hand shading her eyes ? Quite motionless ; as if she were a stone statue . He began to wish she would move -- would look at him -- but any way that she would move , and not stand gazing thus over that great dreary sea . He went down the path with an impatient step , and entered the house - place . There sat his aunt spinning , and apparently as well as ever . He could hear his uncle talking to Kester in the neighbouring shippen ; all was well in the household . Why was Sylvia standing in the garden in that strange quiet way ? '
108556	108570	108607	108607	I	0	' said his aunt , as she stood up to welcome him back . '
108572	108603	108633	108633	He	2891	' when didst ta come , eh?--but thy uncle will be glad to see thee , and to hear thee talk about yon pleughs ; he 's thought a deal o '

Her face was wan and white ; her gray eyes seemed larger , and full of dumb tearless sorrow ; she came up to Philip , as if his being there touched her with no surprise , and gave him a gentle greeting as if he were a familiar indifferent person whom she had seen but yesterday . Philip , who had recollected the quarrel they had had , and about Kinraid too , the very last time they had met , had expected some trace of this remembrance to linger in her looks and speech to him . But there was no such sign ; her great sorrow had wiped away all anger , almost all memory . Her mother looked at her anxiously , and then said in the same manner of forced cheerfulness which she had used before,-- '
109579	109582	109397	109398	Queen Charlotte	320	' full o '

109617	109681	109714	109714	he	191	' Sylvia , silent and docile , went out to the shippen to obey her mother 's wish . Bell Robson leant forward towards Philip , misinterpreting the expression on his face , which was guilt as much as sympathy , and checked the possible repentance which might have urged him on at that moment to tell all he knew , by saying , '
109687	109690	110627	110627	We	2921	' for t '

109740	110626	110627	110627	We	2921	' Robson bustled in with loud welcome ; all the louder and more talkative because he , like his wife , assumed a cheerful manner before Sylvia . Yet he , unlike his wife , had many a secret regret over Kinraid 's fate . At first , while merely the fact of his disappearance was known , Daniel Robson had hit on the truth , and had stuck to his opinion that the cursed press - gang were at the bottom of it . He had backed his words by many an oath , and all the more because he had not a single reason to give that applied to the present occasion . No one on the lonely coast had remarked any sign of the presence of the men - of - war , or the tenders that accompanied them , for the purpose of impressment on the king 's ships . At Shields , and at the mouth of the Tyne , where they lay in greedy wait , the owners of the _ Urania _ had caused strict search to be made for their skilled and protected specksioneer , but with no success . All this positive evidence in contradiction to Daniel Robson 's opinion only made him cling to it the more ; until the day when the hat was found on the shore with Kinraid 's name written out large and fair in the inside , and the tell - tale bit of ribbon knotted in the band . Then Daniel , by a sudden revulsion , gave up every hope ; it never entered his mind that it could have fallen off by any accident . No ! now Kinraid was dead and drowned , and it was a bad job , and the sooner it could be forgotten the better for all parties ; and it was well no one knew how far it had gone with Sylvia , especially now since Bessy Corney was crying her eyes out as if he had been engaged to her . So Daniel said nothing to his wife about the mischief that had gone on in her absence , and never spoke to Sylvia about the affair ; only he was more than usually tender to her in his rough way , and thought , morning , noon , and night , on what he could do to give her pleasure , and drive away all recollection of her ill - starred love . To - night he would have her sit by him while Philip told his stories , or heavily answered questions put to him . Sylvia sat on a stool by her father 's knee , holding one of his hands in both of hers ; and presently she laid down her head upon them , and Philip saw her sad eyes looking into the flickering fire - light with long unwinking stare , showing that her thoughts were far distant . He could hardly go on with his tales of what he had seen , and what done , he was so full of pity for her . Yet , for all his pity , he had now resolved never to soothe her with the knowledge of what he knew , nor to deliver the message sent by her false lover . He felt like a mother withholding something injurious from the foolish wish of her plaining child . But he went away without breathing a word of his good fortune in business . The telling of such kind of good fortune seemed out of place this night , when the thought of death and the loss of friends seemed to brood over the household , and cast its shadow there , obscuring for the time all worldly things . And so the great piece of news came out in the ordinary course of gossip , told by some Monkshaven friend to Robson the next market day . For months Philip had been looking forward to the sensation which the intelligence would produce in the farm household , as a preliminary to laying his good fortune at Sylvia 's feet . And they heard of it , and he away , and all chance of his making use of it in the manner he had intended vanished for the present . Daniel was always curious after other people 's affairs , and now was more than ever bent on collecting scraps of news which might possibly interest Sylvia , and rouse her out of the state of indifference as to everything into which she had fallen . Perhaps he thought that he had not acted altogether wisely in allowing her to engage herself to Kinraid , for he was a man apt to judge by results ; and moreover he had had so much reason to repent of the encouragement which he had given to the lover whose untimely end had so deeply affected his only child , that he was more unwilling than ever that his wife should know of the length to which the affair had gone during her absence . He even urged secrecy upon Sylvia as a personal favour ; unwilling to encounter the silent blame which he openly affected to despise . '

But she went on rather more quickly than she would otherwise have done to question her husband as to all he knew about this great rise of Philip 's . Once or twice Sylvia joined in with languid curiosity ; but presently she became tired and went to bed . For a few moments after she left , her parents sate silent . Then Daniel , in a tone as if he were justifying his daughter , and comforting himself as well as his wife , observed that it was almost on for nine ; the evenings were light so long now . Bell said nothing in reply , but gathered up her wool , and began to arrange the things for night . By - and - by Daniel broke the silence by saying,-- '

The Fosters , with something of the busybodiness which is apt to mingle itself with kindly patronage , had planned in their own minds that the Rose household should be removed altogether to the house belonging to the shop ; and that Alice , with the assistance of the capable servant , who , at present , managed all John 's domestic affairs , should continue as mistress of the house , with Philip and Coulson for her lodgers . But arrangements without her consent did not suit Alice at any time , and she had very good reasons for declining to accede to this . She was not going to be uprooted at her time of life , she said , nor would she consent to enter upon a future which might be so uncertain . Why , Hepburn and Coulson were both young men , she said , and they were as likely to marry as not ; and then the bride would be sure to wish to live in the good old - fashioned house at the back of the shop . It was in vain she was told by every one concerned , that , in case of such an event , the first married partner should take a house of his own , leaving her in undisputed possession . She replied , with apparent truth , that both might wish to marry , and surely the wife of one ought to take possession of the house belonging to the business ; that she was not going to trust herself to the fancies of young men , who were always , the best of them , going and doing the very thing that was most foolish in the way of marriage ; of which state , in fact , she spoke with something of acrimonious contempt and dislike , as if young people always got mismatched , yet had not the sense to let older and wiser people choose for them . '
111962	111980	112164	112165	Hester Rose	209	' said Jeremiah Foster to Philip , on the afternoon succeeding the final discussion of this plan . '
112122	112159	112239	112239	Alice	257	' Philip reddened . Often as the idea of marriage had come into his mind , this was the first time it had been gravely suggested to him by another . But he replied quietly enough . '

112463	112832	112833	112833	I	0	' Philip fell to thinking ; a generation ago something of the same kind had been going on as that which he was now living through , quick with hopes and fears . A girl beloved by two -- nay , those two so identical in occupation as he and Kinraid were -- Rose identical even in character with what he knew of the specksioneer ; a girl choosing the wrong lover , and suffering and soured all her life in consequence of her youth 's mistake ; was that to be Sylvia 's lot?--or , rather , was she not saved from it by the event of the impressment , and by the course of silence he himself had resolved upon ? Then he went on to wonder if the lives of one generation were but a repetition of the lives of those who had gone before , with no variation but from the internal cause that some had greater capacity for suffering than others . Would those very circumstances which made the interest of his life now , return , in due cycle , when he was dead and Sylvia was forgotten ? Perplexed thoughts of this and a similar kind kept returning into Philip 's mind whenever he had leisure to give himself up to consideration of anything but the immediate throng of business . And every time he dwelt on this complication and succession of similar events , he emerged from his reverie more and more satisfied with the course he had taken in withholding from Sylvia all knowledge of her lover 's fate . It was settled at length that Philip was to remove to the house belonging to the shop , Coulson remaining with Alice and her daughter . But in the course of the summer the latter told his partner that he had offered marriage to Hester on the previous day , and been refused . It was an awkward affair altogether , as he lived in their house , and was in daily companionship with Hester , who , however , seemed to preserve her gentle calmness , with only a tinge more of reserve in her manner to Coulson . '
112836	112844	112833	112833	I	0	' could find out what she has again '
112849	112925	112833	112833	I	0	' said Coulson , about a fortnight after he had made the proposal . The poor young man thought that Hester 's composure of manner towards him since the event argued that he was not distasteful to her ; and as he was now on very happy terms with Philip , he came constantly to him , as if the latter could interpret the meaning of all the little occurrences between him and his beloved .

115782	116111	117884	117885	her husband	5645	' Such was a conjugal colloquy about this time . Philip was gaining ground with Daniel , and that was something towards winning Sylvia 's heart ; for she was unaware of her father 's change of feeling towards Kinraid , and took all his tenderness towards herself as if they were marks of his regard for her lost lover and his sympathy in her loss , instead of which he was rather feeling as if it might be a good thing after all that the fickle - hearted sailor was dead and drowned . In fact , Daniel was very like a child in all the parts of his character . He was strongly affected by whatever was present , and apt to forget the absent . He acted on impulse , and too often had reason to be sorry for it ; but he hated his sorrow too much to let it teach him wisdom for the future . With all his many faults , however , he had something in him which made him be dearly loved , both by the daughter whom he indulged , and the wife who was in fact superior to him , but whom he imagined that he ruled with a wise and absolute sway . Love to Sylvia gave Philip tact . He seemed to find out that to please the women of the household he must pay all possible attention to the man ; and though he cared little in comparison for Daniel , yet this autumn he was continually thinking of how he could please him . When he had said or done anything to gratify or amuse her father , Sylvia smiled and was kind . Whatever he did was right with his aunt ; but even she was unusually glad when her husband was pleased . Still his progress was slow towards his object ; and often he sighed himself to sleep with the words , '
116120	117033	117931	117931	He	191	' . Then in his dreams he saw Kinraid again , sometimes struggling , sometimes sailing towards land , the only one on board a swift advancing ship , alone on deck , stern and avenging ; till Philip awoke in remorseful terror . Such and similar dreams returned with the greater frequency when , in the November of that year , the coast between Hartlepool and Monkshaven was overshadowed by the presence of guard - ships , driven south from their station at North Shields by the resolution which the sailors of that port had entered into to resist the press - gang , and the energy with which they had begun to carry out their determination . For on a certain Tuesday evening yet remembered by old inhabitants of North Shields , the sailors in the merchant service met together and overpowered the press - gang , dismissing them from the town with the highest contempt , and with their jackets reversed . A numerous mob went with them to Chirton Bar ; gave them three cheers at parting , but vowed to tear them limb from limb should they seek to re - enter North Shields . But a few days afterwards some fresh cause of irritation arose , and five hundred sailors , armed with such swords and pistols as they could collect , paraded through the town in the most riotous manner , and at last attempted to seize the tender Eleanor , on some pretext of the ill - treatment of the impressed men aboard . This endeavour failed , however , owing to the energetic conduct of the officers in command . Next day this body of sailors set off for Newcastle ; but learning , before they reached the town , that there was a strong military and civil force prepared to receive them there , they dispersed for the time ; but not before the good citizens had received a great fright , the drums of the North Yorkshire militia beating to arms , and the terrified people rushing out into the streets to learn the reason of the alarm , and some of them seeing the militia , under the command of the Earl of Fauconberg , marching from the guard - house adjoining New Gate to the house of rendezvous for impressed seamen in the Broad Chase . But a few weeks after , the impressment service took their revenge for the insults they had been subjected to in North Shields . In the dead of night a cordon was formed round that town by a regiment stationed at Tynemouth barracks ; the press - gangs belonging to armed vessels lying off Shields harbour were let loose ; no one within the circle could escape , and upwards of two hundred and fifty men , sailors , mechanics , labourers of every description , were forced on board the armed ships . With that prize they set sail , and wisely left the place , where deep passionate vengeance was sworn against them . Not all the dread of an invasion by the French could reconcile the people of these coasts to the necessity of impressment . Fear and confusion prevailed after this to within many miles of the sea - shore . A Yorkshire gentleman of rank said that his labourers dispersed like a covey of birds , because a press - gang was reported to have established itself so far inland as Tadcaster ; and they only returned to work on the assurance from the steward of his master 's protection , but even then begged leave to sleep on straw in the stables or outhouses belonging to their landlord , not daring to sleep at their own homes . No fish was caught , for the fishermen dared not venture out to sea ; the markets were deserted , as the press - gangs might come down on any gathering of men ; prices were raised , and many were impoverished ; many others ruined . For in the great struggle in which England was then involved , the navy was esteemed her safeguard ; and men must be had at any price of money , or suffering , or of injustice . Landsmen were kidnapped and taken to London ; there , in too many instances , to be discharged without redress and penniless , because they were discovered to be useless for the purpose for which they had been taken . Autumn brought back the whaling - ships . But the period of their return was full of gloomy anxiety , instead of its being the annual time of rejoicing and feasting ; of gladdened households , where brave steady husbands or sons returned ; of unlimited and reckless expenditure , and boisterous joviality among those who thought that they had earned unbounded licence on shore by their six months of compelled abstinence . In other years this had been the time for new and handsome winter clothing ; for cheerful if humble hospitality ; for the shopkeepers to display their gayest and best ; for the public - houses to be crowded ; for the streets to be full of blue jackets , rolling along with merry words and open hearts . In other years the boiling - houses had been full of active workers , the staithes crowded with barrels , the ship - carpenters '

118446	118754	119825	119825	their	662	' said Philip , and then , to calm his unusually excited aunt , he promised to avoid the subject of the press - gang as much as possible . But it was a promise very difficult of performance , for Daniel Robson was , as his wife said , like one possessed . He could hardly think of anything else , though he himself was occasionally weary of the same constantly recurring idea , and would fain have banished it from his mind . He was too old a man to be likely to be taken by them ; he had no son to become their victim ; but the terror of them , which he had braved and defied in his youth , seemed to come back and take possession of him in his age ; and with the terror came impatient hatred . Since his wife 's illness the previous winter he had been a more sober man until now . He was never exactly drunk , for he had a strong , well - seasoned head ; but the craving to hear the last news of the actions of the press - gang drew him into Monkshaven nearly every day at this dead agricultural season of the year ; and a public - house is generally the focus from which gossip radiates ; and probably the amount of drink thus consumed weakened Robson 's power over his mind , and caused the concentration of thought on one subject . This may be a physiological explanation of what afterwards was spoken of as a supernatural kind of possession , leading him to his doom . CHAPTER XXIII RETALIATION The public - house that had been chosen by the leaders of the press - gang in Monkshaven at this time , for their rendezvous ( or '
118756	119130	120021	120022	some one	1489	' , as it was generally pronounced ) , was an inn of poor repute , with a yard at the back which opened on to the staithe or quay nearest to the open sea . A strong high stone wall bounded this grass - grown mouldy yard on two sides ; the house , and some unused out - buildings , formed the other two . The choice of the place was good enough , both as to situation , which was sufficiently isolated , and yet near to the widening river ; and as to the character of the landlord , John Hobbs was a failing man , one who seemed as if doomed to be unfortunate in all his undertakings , and the consequence of all this was that he was envious of the more prosperous , and willing to do anything that might bring him in a little present success in life . His household consisted of his wife , her niece , who acted as servant , and an out - of - doors man , a brother of Ned Simpson , the well - doing butcher , who at one time had had a fancy for Sylvia . But the one brother was prosperous , the other had gone on sinking in life , like him who was now his master . Neither Hobbs nor his man Simpson were absolutely bad men ; if things had gone well with them they might each have been as scrupulous and conscientious as their neighbours , and even now , supposing the gain in money to be equal , they would sooner have done good than evil ; but a very small sum was enough to turn the balance . And in a greater degree than in most cases was the famous maxim of Rochefoucault true with them ; for in the misfortunes of their friends they seemed to see some justification of their own . It was blind fate dealing out events , not that the events themselves were the inevitable consequences of folly or misconduct . To such men as these the large sum offered by the lieutenant of the press - gang for the accommodation of the Mariners '

Low down in the darkened silent town were many whose hearts went with the angry and excited crowd , and who would bless them and caress them for that night 's deeds . Daniel soon found himself a laggard in planning , compared to some of those around him . But when , with the rushing sound of many steps and but few words , they had arrived at the blank , dark , shut - up Mariners '

The crowd behind him began to jeer and to threaten ; there was no longer any keeping down their voices , their rage , their terrible oaths . If doors and windows had not of late been strengthened with bars of iron in anticipation of some such occasion , they would have been broken in with the onset of the fierce and now yelling crowd who rushed against them with the force of a battering - ram , to recoil in baffled rage from the vain assault . No sign , no sound from within , in that breathless pause . '

The men rushed after him , almost knocking him down , as he made his way into the lane into which the doors of the outbuildings belonging to the inn opened . Daniel had already broken the fastening of that which opened into a damp , mouldy - smelling shippen , in one corner of which a poor lean cow shifted herself on her legs , in an uneasy , restless manner , as her sleeping - place was invaded by as many men as could cram themselves into the dark hold . Daniel , at the end farthest from the door , was almost smothered before he could break down the rotten wooden shutter , that , when opened , displayed the weedy yard of the old inn , the full clear light defining the outline of each blade of grass by the delicate black shadow behind . This hole , used to give air and light to what had once been a stable , in the days when horse travellers were in the habit of coming to the Mariners '

She went ; and she came back . Neither man nor spirit had she seen ; the wind was blowing on the height enough to sweep all creatures before it ; but no one was coming . So they sate down again to keep watch . At length his step was heard close to the door ; and it startled them even in their state of expectation . '

125567	125569	125723	125723	Bell	209	' a '
125606	125615	125701	125701	i	0	' for to know how a managed it a '
125617	125683	125723	125723	Bell	209	' He went wearily upstairs , and wife and daughter both strove their best to ease his aching limbs , and make him comfortable . The warming - pan , only used on state occasions , was taken down and unpapered for his service ; and as he got between the warm sheets , he thanked Sylvia and her mother in a sleepy voice , adding,-- '
125689	125700	125757	125757	He	5486	' comfort to think on yon poor lads as is sleepin '
125702	125709	126777	126777	My	0	' their own homes this neet , '
125736	125756	126782	126782	he	3327	' God bless thee , my man ! Thou was allays for them that was down and put upon . '
126178	126776	126806	126806	he	3327	' noises below ; so after dinner , though far from well , he came down and wandered about the stable and the fields nearest to the house , consulting with Kester as to crops and manure for the most part ; but every now and then breaking out into an episodical chuckle over some part of last night 's proceedings . Kester enjoyed the day even more than his master , for he had no bruises to remind him that , although a hero , he was also flesh and blood . When they returned to the house they found Philip there , for it was already dusk . It was Kester 's usual Sunday plan to withdraw to bed at as early an hour as he could manage to sleep , often in winter before six ; but now he was too full of interest in what Philip might have to tell of Monkshaven news to forego his Sabbath privilege of spending the evening sitting on the chair at the end of the dresser behind the door . Philip was as close to Sylvia as he could possibly get without giving her offence , when they came in . Her manner was listless and civil ; she had lost all that active feeling towards him which made him positively distasteful , and had called out her girlish irritation and impertinence . She now was rather glad to see him than otherwise . He brought some change into the heavy monotony of her life -- monotony so peaceful until she had been stirred by passion out of that content with the small daily events which had now become burdensome recurrences . Insensibly to herself she was becoming dependent on his timid devotion , his constant attention ; and he , lover - like , once so attracted , in spite of his judgment , by her liveliness and piquancy , now doted on her languor , and thought her silence more sweet than words . He had only just arrived when master and man came in . He had been to afternoon chapel ; none of them had thought of going to the distant church ; worship with them was only an occasional duty , and this day their minds had been too full of the events of the night before . Daniel sate himself heavily down in his accustomed chair , the three - cornered arm - chair in the fireside corner , which no one thought of anybody else ever occupying on any occasion whatever . In a minute or two he interrupted Philip 's words of greeting and inquiry by breaking out into the story of the rescue of last night . But to the mute surprise of Sylvia , the only one who noticed it , Philip 's face , instead of expressing admiration and pleasant wonder , lengthened into dismay ; once or twice he began to interrupt , but stopped himself as if he would consider his words again . Kester was never tired of hearing his master talk ; by long living together they understood every fold of each other 's minds , and small expressions had much significance to them . Bell , too , sate thankful that her husband should have done such deeds . Only Sylvia was made uneasy by Philip 's face and manner . When Daniel had ended there was a great silence , instead of the questions and compliments he looked to receive . He became testy , and turning to Bell , said,-- '
126790	126800	126806	126806	he	3327	' little profit he has made on his pins an '
126823	126827	126806	126806	he	3327	' carried out o '
126830	126834	126806	126806	he	3327	' wives and little '

126848	126932	126959	126959	They	3330	' workhouse or clem for aught he cares . Philip went very red , and then more sallow than usual . He had not been thinking of Charley Kinraid , but of quite another thing , while Daniel had told his story ; but this last speech of the old man 's brought up the remembrance that was always quick , do what he would to smother or strangle it . He did not speak for a moment or two , then he said,-- '
126945	126951	126985	126985	they	3330	' rioters , as folks call 'em
126966	126980	126944	126946	T ' rioters	8111	' men - o'-war 's men ; and it were taken up by th '

127035	127069	127139	127139	he	3337	' This was rather a more serious account of the progress of the affair than any one had calculated upon . They looked grave upon it awhile , then Daniel took heart and said,-- '
127088	127106	127151	127151	Philip	191	' a straw when their blood is up ; still it 's hard lines to call out t '
127134	127137	127151	127151	Philip	191	' t ! '

127232	127235	127265	127267	a - be	3342	' Why ? '
127241	127253	127271	127273	a - be	3342	' It 's niver a thing to be sorry on . I 'm

127275	127283	127337	127337	I	0	' said Daniel , in much dudgeon . '

The women looked at each other with blank eyes , as if they were as yet unable to take in the new idea that the conduct which had seemed to them a subject for such just pride could be regarded by any one as deserving of punishment or retribution . Daniel spoke before they had recovered from their amazement . '

130040	130084	130005	130005	Philip	191	' said Kester , rushing to the door , for he saw what the others did not -- that all chance of escape was over ; the constables were already at the top of the little field - path not twenty yards off . '
130091	130190	130005	130005	Philip	191	' cried Bell , wringing her hands in terror ; for she , indeed they all , knew that flight would now be impossible . Daniel was heavy , rheumatic , and , moreover , had been pretty severely bruised on that unlucky night . Philip , without another word , pushed Daniel before him upstairs , feeling that his own presence at Haytersbank Farm at that hour of the day would be a betrayal . They had just time to shut themselves up in the larger bed - room , before they heard a scuffle and the constables '
130196	130198	130358	130358	Measter	3406	' They 're
130201	130279	130359	130359	Hepburn	191	' said Philip , as Daniel squeezed himself under the bed ; and then they held quite still , Philip as much concealed by the scanty , blue - check curtain as he could manage to be . They heard a confusion of voices below , a hasty moving of chairs , a banging of doors , a further parley , and then a woman 's scream , shrill and pitiful ; then steps on the stairs . '
130285	130357	130427	130429	the other constable	3407	' sighed Philip . In one instant the door was opened , and each of the hiders was conscious of the presence of the constables , although at first the latter stood motionless , surveying the apparently empty room with disappointment . Then in another moment they had rushed at Philip 's legs , exposed as these were . They drew him out with violence , and then let him go . '
130361	130415	130427	130429	the other constable	3407	' said one in amaze . But immediately they put two and two together ; for in so small a place as Monkshaven every one 's relationships and connexions , and even likings , were known ; and the motive of Philip 's coming out to Haytersbank was perfectly clear to these men . '
130417	130425	130462	130462	he	3408	' other 'll not be far off , '

Kester was in a corner of the room , sullenly standing . Bell quaked from head to foot as her husband came down - stairs a prisoner . She opened her lips several times with an uneasy motion , as if she would fain say something , but knew not what . Sylvia 's passionate swollen lips and her beautiful defiant eyes gave her face quite a new aspect ; she looked a helpless fury . '

133117	133141	133158	133158	sir	1162	' And Mr. Donkin 's face became graver , and the expression more concentrated . Looking up suddenly at Philip , he said , '

133160	133168	133208	133208	you	191	' in a tone that indicated the unexpressed '

133295	133336	133387	133388	Mr. Donkin	363	'm all as Daniel 's wife and daughter has to look to ; and I 've their grief heavy on my heart . You could not tell me what is to be done with Daniel , could you , sir ? '
133337	133378	133409	133410	poor Philip	191	' He 'll be brought up before the magistrates to - morrow morning for final examination , along with the others , you know , before he 's sent to York Castle to take his trial at the spring assizes . '
133379	133386	133409	133410	poor Philip	191	' To York Castle , sir ? '

133415	133459	133485	133485	sir	1162	' To - morrow : most probably as soon as the examination is over . The evidence is clear as to his being present , aiding and abetting,--indicted on the 4th section of 1 George I. , statute 1 , chapter 5 . I 'm

133487	133507	133511	133511	they	3510	' said Philip , his heart getting full ; more from Mr. Donkin 's manner than from his words . '

133522	133532	133672	133674	my good fellow	3517	' Mr. Donkin half smiled at the ignorance displayed . '

133616	133669	133676	133676	I	0	' asked Philip , with sharp beseeching in his voice . He had never imagined that it was a capital offence ; and the thought of his aunt 's and Sylvia 's ignorance of the possible fate awaiting him whom they so much loved , was like a stab to his heart . '
133677	133700	133731	133732	Mr. Donkin	363	'm sorry ; but , you see , it 's my duty to do all I can to bring criminals to justice . '
133701	133713	133731	133732	Mr. Donkin	363	' My uncle thought he was doing such a fine deed . '
133714	133729	133676	133676	I	0	' Demolishing and pulling down , destroying and burning dwelling - houses and outhouses , '
133734	133742	133676	133676	I	0	' He must have some peculiar notions . '
133743	133810	133819	133819	I	0	' The people is so mad with the press - gang , and Daniel has been at sea hisself ; and took it so to heart when he heard of mariners and seafaring folk being carried off , and just cheated into doing what was kind and helpful -- leastways , what would have been kind and helpful , if there had been a fire . I 'm
133820	133843	133960	133961	Mr. Donkin	363	'm sure ; but I can not help thinking as Daniel had a deal to justify him on Saturday night , sir . '
133844	133918	133989	133989	he	363	' Well ; you must try and get a good lawyer to bring out all that side of the question . There 's a good deal to be said on it ; but it 's my duty to get up all the evidence to prove that he and others were present on the night in question ; so , as you 'll perceive , I can give you no help in defending him . '
133919	133959	134173	134174	Mr. Donkin	363	' But who can , sir ? I came to you as a friend who , I thought , would see me through it . And I do n't know any other lawyer ; leastways , to speak to . '
134007	134136	134173	134174	Mr. Donkin	363	' You 'd better go to Edward Dawson on the other side of the river ; he that was articled clerk with me two years ago , you know . He 's a clever fellow , and has not too much practice ; he 'll do the best he can for you . He 'll have to be at the court - house , tell him , to - morrow morning at ten , when the justices meet . He 'll watch the case for you ; and then he 'll give you his opinion , and tell you what to do . You ca n't do better than follow his advice . I must do all I can to collect evidence for a conviction , you know . '
134166	134171	134261	134261	he	191	' Pooh ! pooh ! '
134181	134221	134292	134293	Mr. Donkin	363	' Do n't be a fool ; you 'll need it all before the trial 's over . I 've done nothing , man . It would be a pretty thing for me to be feed by both parties . '
134268	134282	134292	134293	Mr. Donkin	363	' You 'll not be hard upon him , sir , I hope ? '
134283	134290	134331	134331	he	363	' I must do my duty , '
134299	134306	134444	134450	A clerk as smart as the door	3527	' without any question of hardness . '

134482	134519	134757	134757	Philip	191	' He 'll be at home in less than an hour ; he 's only gone to make Mrs Dawson 's will -- Mrs. Dawson , of Collyton -- she 's not expected to get better . '
134576	134606	134760	134760	he	191	' I 'll be back in an hour , then . It 's gone a quarter to four ; I 'll be back before five , tell Mr. Dawson . '
134742	134756	134757	134757	Philip	191	' To be sure he could ; how far was it to go ? '
134762	134789	134832	134832	Philip	191	' Up the Knotting Lane , to the stile leading down to Haytersbank Farm ; they 'll have to wait there for some as are coming . '
134790	134822	134832	134832	Philip	191	' They must not wait long such an evening as this ; standing in such rain and wind as there 'll be up there , is enough to kill a horse . '

135396	135483	135521	135521	God	240	' He had used words as if he was making a request to Hester ; but he did not seem to await her answer , so sure was he that she would go . She noticed this , and noticed also that the rain was spoken of in reference to them , not to her . A cold shadow passed over her heart , though it was nothing more than she already knew -- that Sylvia was the one centre of his thoughts and his love . '
135494	135513	135549	135549	i	0	' said she , gently . Philip pressed her hand tenderly , a glow of gratitude overspread him . '

136172	136605	136619	136619	We	3565	' said he , as he wrapped her well up in the cart , and placed the bundles of cloaks and things by her side . Along the street , in the jolting cart , as long as Hester could see the misty light streaming out of the shop door , so long was Philip standing bareheaded in the rain looking after her . But she knew that it was not her own poor self that attracted his lingering gaze . It was the thought of the person she was bound to . CHAPTER XXVI A DREARY VIGIL Through the dark rain , against the cold wind , shaken over the rough stones , went Hester in the little tax - cart . Her heart kept rising against her fate ; the hot tears came unbidden to her eyes . But rebellious heart was soothed , and hot tears were sent back to their source before the time came for her alighting . The driver turned his horse in the narrow lane , and shouted after her an injunction to make haste as , with her head bent low , she struggled down to the path to Haytersbank Farm . She saw the light in the window from the top of the brow , and involuntarily she slackened her pace . She had never seen Bell Robson , and would Sylvia recollect her ? If she did not how awkward it would be to give the explanation of who she was , and what her errand was , and why she was sent . Nevertheless , it must be done ; so on she went , and standing within the little porch , she knocked faintly at the door ; but in the bluster of the elements the sound was lost . Again she knocked , and now the murmur of women 's voices inside was hushed , and some one came quickly to the door , and opened it sharply . It was Sylvia . Although her face was completely in shadow , of course Hester knew her well ; but she , if indeed she would have recognized Hester less disguised , did not know in the least who the woman , muffled up in a great cloak , with her hat tied down with a silk handkerchief , standing in the porch at this time of night , could be . Nor , indeed , was she in a mood to care or to inquire . She said hastily , in a voice rendered hoarse and arid with grief : '
136629	136781	136810	136810	missus	878	' and she hastily shut the door in Hester 's face , before the latter could put together the right words in which to explain her errand . Hester stood outside in the dark , wet porch discomfited , and wondering how next to obtain a hearing through the shut and bolted door . Not long did she stand , however ; some one was again at the door , talking in a voice of distress and remonstrance , and slowly unbarring the bolts . A tall , thin figure of an elderly woman was seen against the warm fire - light inside as soon as the door was opened ; a hand was put out , like that which took the dove into the ark , and Hester was drawn into the warmth and the light , while Bell 's voice went on speaking to Sylvia before addressing the dripping stranger-- '
136792	136794	136816	136816	yo	878	' t '
136817	136834	136810	136810	missus	878	' mun forgive us , for a great sorrow has fallen upon us this day , an '

137024	137054	137061	137061	she	209	' said Hester , touched by the poor woman 's evident effort to forget her own grief in the duties of hospitality , and loving Bell from that moment . '

137212	137321	137353	137353	he	3575	' Bell was up and about , making for the place where she kept her out - going things , almost before Hester had begun to speak . She hardly understood about her husband 's being sent to York , in the possession of the idea that she might go and see him . She did not understand or care how , in this wild night , she was to get to Monkshaven ; all she thought of was , that she might go and see her husband . But Sylvia took in more points than her mother , and , almost suspiciously , began to question Hester . '

138293	138318	138290	138290	they	3600	' said Sylvia , suddenly , lifting her bowed head , as though she would read her companion 's face in the dim light . '
138323	138467	138837	138837	I	0	' said Hester , sadly . They were now jolting over the paved streets , and not a word could be spoken . They were now at Philip 's door , which was opened to receive them even before they arrived , as if some one had been watching and listening . The old servant , Phoebe , the fixture in the house , who had belonged to it and to the shop for the last twenty years , came out , holding a candle and sheltering it in her hand from the weather , while Philip helped the tottering steps of Mrs. Robson as she descended behind . As Hester had got in last , so she had now to be the first to move . Just as she was moving , Sylvia 's cold little hand was laid on her arm . '
138475	138495	138844	138844	she	3601	' . I ask yo'r pardon for speaking cross , but , indeed , my heart 's a'most broken wi '
138500	138836	138844	138844	she	3601	' The voice was so plaintive , so full of tears , that Hester could not but yearn towards the speaker . She bent over and kissed her cheek , and then clambered unaided down by the wheel on the dark side of the cart . Wistfully she longed for one word of thanks or recognition from Philip , in whose service she had performed this hard task ; but he was otherwise occupied , and on casting a further glance back as she turned the corner of the street , she saw Philip lifting Sylvia carefully down in his arms from her footing on the top of the wheel , and then they all went into the light and the warmth , the door was shut , the lightened cart drove briskly away , and Hester , in rain , and cold , and darkness , went homewards with her tired sad heart . Philip had done all he could , since his return from lawyer Dawson 's , to make his house bright and warm for the reception of his beloved . He had a strong apprehension of the probable fate of poor Daniel Robson ; he had a warm sympathy with the miserable distress of the wife and daughter ; but still at the back of his mind his spirits danced as if this was to them a festal occasion . He had even taken unconscious pleasure in Phoebe 's suspicious looks and tones , as he had hurried and superintended her in her operations . A fire blazed cheerily in the parlour , almost dazzling to the travellers brought in from the darkness and the rain ; candles burned -- two candles , much to Phoebe 's discontent . Poor Bell Robson had to sit down almost as soon as she entered the room , so worn out was she with fatigue and excitement ; yet she grudged every moment which separated her , as she thought , from her husband . '
138838	138842	138844	138844	she	3601	'm ready now , '

He went to the kitchen door and asked if the gruel was not ready , so anxious was he to stop the conversation at this point ; but Phoebe , who held her young master in but little respect , scolded him for a stupid man , who thought , like all his sex , that gruel was to be made in a minute , whatever the fire was , and bade him come and make it for himself if he was in such a hurry . He had to return discomfited to Sylvia , who meanwhile had arranged her thoughts ready to return to the charge . '

140390	140430	140695	140695	Sylvie	188	' asked she , keeping down her agitation to look at Philip the more sharply . Her eyes never slackened their penetrating gaze at his countenance , until he replied , with the utmost unwillingness , and most apparent confusion,-- '
140439	140694	140767	140767	his	3636	' He knew that he held back a worse contingency , and he was mortally afraid that she would perceive this reserve . But what he did say was so much beyond her utmost apprehension , which had only reached to various terms of imprisonment , that she did not imagine the dark shadow lurking behind . What he had said was too much for her . Her eyes dilated , her lips blanched , her pale cheeks grew yet paler . After a minute 's look into his face , as if fascinated by some horror , she stumbled backwards into the chair in the chimney comer , and covered her face with her hands , moaning out some inarticulate words . Philip was on his knees by her , dumb from excess of sympathy , kissing her dress , all unfelt by her ; he murmured half - words , he began passionate sentences that died away upon his lips ; and she -- she thought of nothing but her father , and was possessed and rapt out of herself by the dread of losing him to that fearful country which was almost like the grave to her , so all but impassable was the gulf . But Philip knew that it was possible that the separation impending might be that of the dark , mysterious grave -- that the gulf between the father and child might indeed be that which no living , breathing , warm human creature can ever cross .

141110	141293	141314	141314	she	3640	' she choked out , almost stuffing her apron into her mouth to deaden the sound , and catching at Philip 's hand , and wringing it with convulsive force , till the pain that he loved was nearly more than he could bear . No words of his could touch such agony ; but irrepressibly , and as he would have done it to a wounded child , he bent over her , and kissed her with a tender , trembling kiss . She did not repulse it , probably she did not even perceive it . At that moment Phoebe came in with the gruel . Philip saw her , and knew , in an instant , what the old woman 's conclusion must needs be ; but Sylvia had to be shaken by the now standing Philip , before she could be brought back to the least consciousness of the present time . She lifted up her white face to understand his words , then she rose up like one who slowly comes to the use of her limbs . '

Much of this furniture was old , and had belonged to the brothers Foster , and they had let Philip have it at a very reasonable rate ; but still the purchase of it had diminished the amount of his savings . But on the sum which he possessed he drew largely -- he drew all -- nay , he overdrew his account somewhat , to his former masters '

Ever since Daniel 's committal , the decay that had imperceptibly begun in his wife 's bodily and mental strength during her illness of the previous winter , had been making quicker progress . She lost her reticence of speech , and often talked to herself . She had not so much forethought as of old ; slight differences , it is true , but which , with some others of the same description , gave foundation for the homely expression which some now applied to Bell , '

143216	143262	143367	143367	she	220	' Sylvia came slowly down the stairs , and stood before him . Her face was pale , her mouth set and determined ; the light of her eyes veiled in gloom . Kester shrank from her look , and even more from her silence . '
143269	143283	143300	143302	a silly wench	3685	' said he , after a little pause . She was still silent . '

143479	143510	143523	143523	A'll	246	' and she went towards him . He took her little head between his horny hands and kissed it . She looked up with tears in her eyes , saying softly,-- '
143521	143522	144310	144311	DEAR SYLVIA	375	' '
143530	144309	144570	144570	you	188	' he interrupted . He kept his word . In all Philip 's comings and goings to and from Haytersbank Farm at this time , he never spoke again of his love . In look , words , manner , he was like a thoughtful , tender brother ; nothing more . He could be nothing more in the presence of the great dread which loomed larger upon him after every conversation with the lawyer . For Mr. Donkin had been right in his prognostication . Government took up the attack on the Rendezvous with a high and heavy hand . It was necessary to assert authority which had been of late too often braved . An example must be made , to strike dismay into those who opposed and defied the press - gang ; and all the minor authorities who held their powers from Government were in a similar manner severe and relentless in the execution of their duty . So the attorney , who went over to see the prisoner in York Castle , told Philip . He added that Daniel still retained his pride in his achievement , and could not be brought to understand the dangerous position in which he was placed ; that when pressed and questioned as to circumstances that might possibly be used in his defence , he always wandered off to accounts of previous outrages committed by the press - gang , or to passionate abuse of the trick by which men had been lured from their homes on the night in question to assist in putting out an imaginary fire , and then seized and carried off . Some of this very natural indignation might possibly have some effect on the jury ; and this seemed the only ground of hope , and was indeed a slight one , as the judge was likely to warn the jury against allowing their natural sympathy in such a case to divert their minds from the real question . Such was the substance of what Philip heard , and heard repeatedly , during his many visits to Mr. Dawson . And now the time of trial drew near ; for the York assizes opened on March the twelfth ; not much above three weeks since the offence was committed which took Daniel from his home and placed him in peril of death . Philip was glad that , the extremity of his danger never having been hinted to Bell , and travelling some forty miles being a most unusual exertion at that time to persons of her class , the idea of going to see her husband at York had never suggested itself to Bell 's mind . Her increasing feebleness made this seem a step only to be taken in case of the fatal extreme necessity ; such was the conclusion that both Sylvia and he had come to ; and it was the knowledge of this that made Sylvia strangle her own daily longing to see her father . Not but that her hopes were stronger than her fears . Philip never told her the causes for despondency ; she was young , and she , like her father , could not understand how fearful sometimes is the necessity for prompt and severe punishment of rebellion against authority . Philip was to be in York during the time of the assizes ; and it was understood , almost without words , that if the terrible worst occurred , the wife and daughter were to come to York as soon as might be . For this end Philip silently made all the necessary arrangements before leaving Monkshaven . The sympathy of all men was with him ; it was too large an occasion for Coulson to be anything but magnanimous . He urged Philip to take all the time requisite ; to leave all business cares to him . And as Philip went about pale and sad , there was another cheek that grew paler still , another eye that filled with quiet tears as his heaviness of heart became more and more apparent . The day for opening the assizes came on . Philip was in York Minster , watching the solemn antique procession in which the highest authority in the county accompanies the judges to the House of the Lord , to be there admonished as to the nature of their duties . As Philip listened to the sermon with a strained and beating heart , his hopes rose higher than his fears for the first time , and that evening he wrote his first letter to Sylvia . '

I have been hearing the sermon to - day which is preached to the judges ; and the clergyman said so much in it about mercy and forgiveness , I think they can not fail to be lenient this assize . I have seen uncle , who looks but thin , but is in good heart : only he will keep saying he would do it over again if he had the chance , which neither Mr. Dawson nor I think is wise in him , in especial as the gaoler is by and hears every word as is said . He was very fain of hearing all about home ; and wants you to rear Daisy 's calf , as he thinks she will prove a good one . He bade me give his best love to you and my aunt , and his kind duty to Kester . '

Sylvia had all ready for her mother 's tea against she wakened ; but she slept on and on , the peaceful sleep of a child , and Sylvia did not care to waken her . Just after the sun had set , she saw Kester outside the window making signs to her to come out . She stole out on tip - toe by the back - kitchen , the door of which was standing open . She almost ran against Philip , who did not perceive her , as he was awaiting her coming the other way round the corner of the house , and who turned upon her a face whose import she read in an instant .

With Kester 's help she was borne into the back - kitchen , and Kester rushed to the pump for some cold water to throw over her . While Philip , kneeling at her head , was partly supporting her in his arms , and heedless of any sight or sound , the shadow of some one fell upon him .

149669	150189	150248	150248	he	191	' Day after day there was this constant reference to her dead husband . In one sense it was a blessing ; all the circumstances attendant on his sad and untimely end were swept out of her mind along with the recollection of the fact itself . She referred to him as absent , and had always some plausible way of accounting for it , which satisfied her own mind ; and , accordingly they fell into the habit of humouring her , and speaking of him as gone to Monkshaven , or afield , or wearied out , and taking a nap upstairs , as her fancy led her to believe for the moment . But this forgetfulness , though happy for herself , was terrible for her child . It was a constant renewing of Sylvia 's grief , while her mother could give her no sympathy , no help , or strength in any circumstances that arose out of this grief . She was driven more and more upon Philip ; his advice and his affection became daily more necessary to her . Kester saw what would be the end of all this more clearly than Sylvia did herself ; and , impotent to hinder what he feared and disliked , he grew more and more surly every day . Yet he tried to labour hard and well for the interests of the family , as if they were bound up in his good management of the cattle and land . He was out and about by the earliest dawn , working all day long with might and main . He bought himself a pair of new spectacles , which might , he fancied , enable him to read the _ Farmer 's Complete Guide _ , his dead master 's _ vade - mecum _ . But he had never learnt more than his capital letters , and had forgotten many of them ; so the spectacles did him but little good . Then he would take the book to Sylvia , and ask her to read to him the instructions he needed ; instructions , be it noted , that he would formerly have despised as mere book - learning : but his present sense of responsibility had made him humble . Sylvia would find the place with all deliberation : and putting her finger under the line to keep the exact place of the word she was reading , she would strive in good earnest to read out the directions given ; but when every fourth word had to be spelt , it was rather hopeless work , especially as all these words were unintelligible to the open - mouthed listener , however intent he might be . He had generally to fall back on his own experience ; and , guided by that , things were not doing badly in his estimation , when , one day , Sylvia said to him , as they were in the hay - field , heaping up the hay into cocks with Dolly Reid 's assistance-- '

155887	156621	155856	155856	yo	3928	' One or two more speeches of this kind convinced him that it would be wise in him to take her at her word . He went back to Simpson , and found him , though still alive , past the understanding of any words of human forgiveness . Philip had almost wished he had not troubled or irritated Sylvia by urging the dying man 's request : the performance of this duty seemed now to have been such a useless office . After all , the performance of a duty is never a useless office , though we may not see the consequences , or they may be quite different to what we expected or calculated on . In the pause of active work , when daylight was done , and the evening shades came on , Sylvia had time to think ; and her heart grew sad and soft , in comparison to what it had been when Philip 's urgency had called out all her angry opposition . She thought of her father -- his sharp passions , his frequent forgiveness , or rather his forgetfulness that he had even been injured . All Sylvia 's persistent or enduring qualities were derived from her mother , her impulses from her father . It was her dead father whose example filled her mind this evening in the soft and tender twilight . She did not say to herself that she would go and tell Simpson that she forgave him ; but she thought that if Philip asked her again that she should do so . But when she saw Philip again he told her that Simpson was dead ; and passed on from what he had reason to think would be an unpleasant subject to her . Thus he never learnt how her conduct might have been more gentle and relenting than her words -- words which came up into his memory at a future time , with full measure of miserable significance . In general , Sylvia was gentle and good enough ; but Philip wanted her to be shy and tender with him , and this she was not . She spoke to him , her pretty eyes looking straight and composedly at him . She consulted him like the family friend that he was : she met him quietly in all the arrangements for the time of their marriage , which she looked upon more as a change of home , as the leaving of Haytersbank , as it would affect her mother , than in any more directly personal way . Philip was beginning to feel , though not as yet to acknowledge , that the fruit he had so inordinately longed for was but of the nature of an apple of Sodom . Long ago , lodging in widow Rose 's garret , he had been in the habit of watching some pigeons that were kept by a neighbour ; the flock disported themselves on the steep tiled roofs just opposite to the attic window , and insensibly Philip grew to know their ways , and one pretty , soft little dove was somehow perpetually associated in his mind with his idea of his cousin Sylvia . The pigeon would sit in one particular place , sunning herself , and puffing out her feathered breast , with all the blue and rose - coloured lights gleaming in the morning rays , cooing softly to herself as she dressed her plumage . Philip fancied that he saw the same colours in a certain piece of shot silk -- now in the shop ; and none other seemed to him so suitable for his darling 's wedding - dress . He carried enough to make a gown , and gave it to her one evening , as she sate on the grass just outside the house , half attending to her mother , half engaged in knitting stockings for her scanty marriage outfit . He was glad that the sun was not gone down , thus allowing him to display the changing colours in fuller light . Sylvia admired it duly ; even Mrs. Robson was pleased and attracted by the soft yet brilliant hues . Philip whispered to Sylvia--(he took delight in whispers,--she , on the contrary , always spoke to him in her usual tone of voice)-- '

He told her he should ask Hester , who was always so good and kind -- who never yet had said him nay , to go to church with them as bridesmaid -- for Sylvia would give no thought or care to anything but her mother -- and that they would leave her at Haytersbank as they returned from church ; she would manage Mrs Robson 's removal -- she would do this -- do that -- do everything . Such friendly confidence had Philip in Hester 's willingness and tender skill . Sylvia acquiesced at length , and Philip took upon himself to speak to Hester on the subject . '
157474	157493	157530	157530	He	0	' said he , one day when he was preparing to go home after the shop was closed ; '

157716	157923	157942	157942	she	188	' seemed the only source of strength that could have enabled her to go patiently through the next half - hour . As it was , she unselfishly brought all her mind to bear upon the subject ; admired this , thought and decided upon that , as one by one Philip showed her all his alterations and improvements . Never was such a quiet little bit of unconscious and unrecognized heroism . She really ended by such a conquest of self that she could absolutely sympathize with the proud expectant lover , and had quenched all envy of the beloved , in sympathy with the delight she imagined Sylvia must experience when she discovered all these proofs of Philip 's fond consideration and care . But it was a great strain on the heart , that source of life ; and when Hester returned into the parlour , after her deliberate survey of the house , she felt as weary and depressed in bodily strength as if she had gone through an illness of many days . She sate down on the nearest chair , and felt as though she never could rise again . Philip , joyous and content , stood near her talking . '

158271	158817	159190	159191	Mrs Hepburn	393	' Philip was on the point of urging her afresh to go with them to church ; but something in her eyes brought a thought across his mind , as transitory as a breath passes over a looking - glass , and he desisted from his entreaty , and put away his thought as a piece of vain coxcombry , insulting to Hester . He passed rapidly on to all the careful directions rendered necessary by her compliance with the latter part of his request , coupling Sylvia 's name with his perpetually ; so that Hester looked upon her as a happy girl , as eager in planning all the details of her marriage as though no heavy shameful sorrow had passed over her head not many months ago . Hester did not see Sylvia 's white , dreamy , resolute face , that answered the solemn questions of the marriage service in a voice that did not seem her own . Hester was not with them to notice the heavy abstraction that made the bride as if unconscious of her husband 's loving words , and then start and smile , and reply with a sad gentleness of tone . No ! Hester 's duty lay in conveying the poor widow and mother down from Haytersbank to the new home in Monkshaven ; and for all Hester 's assistance and thoughtfulness , it was a dreary , painful piece of work -- the poor old woman crying like a child , with bewilderment at the confused bustle which , in spite of all Sylvia 's careful forethought , could not be avoided on this final day , when her mother had to be carried away from the homestead over which she had so long presided . But all this was as nothing to the distress which overwhelmed poor Bell Robson when she entered Philip 's house ; the parlour -- the whole place so associated with the keen agony she had undergone there , that the stab of memory penetrated through her deadened senses , and brought her back to misery . In vain Hester tried to console her by telling her the fact of Sylvia 's marriage with Philip in every form of words that occurred to her . Bell only remembered her husband 's fate , which filled up her poor wandering mind , and coloured everything ; insomuch that Sylvia not being at hand to reply to her mother 's cry for her , the latter imagined that her child , as well as her husband , was in danger of trial and death , and refused to be comforted by any endeavour of the patient sympathizing Hester . In a pause of Mrs Robson 's sobs , Hester heard the welcome sound of the wheels of the returning shandry , bearing the bride and bridegroom home . It stopped at the door -- an instant , and Sylvia , white as a sheet at the sound of her mother 's wailings , which she had caught while yet at a distance , with the quick ears of love , came running in ; her mother feebly rose and tottered towards her , and fell into her arms , saying , '
158835	159146	159375	159375	mother	684	' Hester could not but be touched with the young girl 's manner to her mother -- as tender , as protecting as if their relation to each other had been reversed , and she was lulling and tenderly soothing a wayward , frightened child . She had neither eyes nor ears for any one till her mother was sitting in trembling peace , holding her daughter 's hand tight in both of hers , as if afraid of losing sight of her : then Sylvia turned to Hester , and , with the sweet grace which is a natural gift to some happy people , thanked her ; in common words enough she thanked her , but in that nameless manner , and with that strange , rare charm which made Hester feel as if she had never been thanked in all her life before ; and from that time forth she understood , if she did not always yield to , the unconscious fascination which Sylvia could exercise over others at times . Did it enter into Philip 's heart to perceive that he had wedded his long - sought bride in mourning raiment , and that the first sounds which greeted them as they approached their home were those of weeping and wailing ? CHAPTER XXX HAPPY DAYS And now Philip seemed as prosperous as his heart could desire . The business flourished , and money beyond his moderate wants came in . As for himself he required very little ; but he had always looked forward to placing his idol in a befitting shrine ; and means for this were now furnished to him . The dress , the comforts , the position he had desired for Sylvia were all hers . She did not need to do a stroke of household work if she preferred to '
159156	159189	159375	159375	mother	684	' . Indeed Phoebe resented any interference in the domestic labour , which she had performed so long , that she looked upon the kitchen as a private empire of her own . '
159192	159374	159375	159375	mother	684	' ( as Sylvia was now termed ) had a good dark silk gown - piece in her drawers , as well as the poor dove - coloured , against the day when she chose to leave off mourning ; and stuff for either gray or scarlet cloaks was hers at her bidding . What she cared for far more were the comforts with which it was in her power to surround her mother . In this Philip vied with her ; for besides his old love , and new pity for his aunt Bell , he never forgot how she had welcomed him to Haytersbank , and favoured his love to Sylvia , in the yearning days when he little hoped he should ever win his cousin to be his wife . But even if he had not had these grateful and affectionate feelings towards the poor woman , he would have done much for her if only to gain the sweet , rare smiles which his wife never bestowed upon him so freely as when she saw him attending to '
159377	159482	159190	159191	Mrs Hepburn	393	' for so both of them now called Bell . For her creature comforts , her silk gowns , and her humble luxury , Sylvia did not care ; Philip was almost annoyed at the indifference she often manifested to all his efforts to surround her with such things . It was even a hardship to her to leave off her country dress , her uncovered hair , her linsey petticoat , and loose bed - gown , and to don a stiff and stately gown for her morning dress . Sitting in the dark parlour at the back of the shop , and doing '
159486	159540	159375	159375	mother	684	' was much more wearying to her than running out into the fields to bring up the cows , or spinning wool , or making up butter . She sometimes thought to herself that it was a strange kind of life where there were no out - door animals to look after ; the '
159545	159624	159190	159191	Mrs Hepburn	393	' had hitherto come into all her ideas of humanity ; and her care and gentleness had made the dumb creatures round her father 's home into mute friends with loving eyes , looking at her as if wistful to speak in words the grateful regard that she could read without the poor expression of language . She missed the free open air , the great dome of sky above the fields ; she rebelled against the necessity of '
159626	159933	160617	160617	Kester	222	' ( as she called it ) to go out , although she acknowledged that it was a necessity where the first step beyond the threshold must be into a populous street . It is possible that Philip was right at one time when he had thought to win her by material advantages ; but the old vanities had been burnt out of her by the hot iron of acute suffering . A great deal of passionate feeling still existed , concealed and latent ; but at this period it appeared as though she were indifferent to most things , and had lost the power of either hoping or fearing much . She was stunned into a sort of temporary numbness on most points ; those on which she was sensitive being such as referred to the injustice and oppression of her father 's death , or anything that concerned her mother . She was quiet even to passiveness in all her dealings with Philip ; he would have given not a little for some of the old bursts of impatience , the old pettishness , which , naughty as they were , had gone to form his idea of the former Sylvia . Once or twice he was almost vexed with her for her docility ; he wanted her so much to have a will of her own , if only that he might know how to rouse her to pleasure by gratifying it . Indeed he seldom fell asleep at nights without his last thoughts being devoted to some little plan for the morrow , that he fancied she would like ; and when he wakened in the early dawn he looked to see if she were indeed sleeping by his side , or whether it was not all a dream that he called Sylvia '
159936	160612	160617	160617	Kester	222	' He was aware that her affection for him was not to be spoken of in the same way as his for her , but he found much happiness in only being allowed to love and cherish her ; and with the patient perseverance that was one remarkable feature in his character , he went on striving to deepen and increase her love when most other men would have given up the endeavour , made themselves content with half a heart , and turned to some other object of attainment . All this time Philip was troubled by a dream that recurred whenever he was over - fatigued , or otherwise not in perfect health . Over and over again in this first year of married life he dreamt this dream ; perhaps as many as eight or nine times , and it never varied . It was always of Kinraid 's return ; Kinraid was full of life in Philip 's dream , though in his waking hours he could and did convince himself by all the laws of probability that his rival was dead . He never remembered the exact sequence of events in that terrible dream after he had roused himself , with a fight and a struggle , from his feverish slumbers . He was generally sitting up in bed when he found himself conscious , his heart beating wildly , with a conviction of Kinraid 's living presence somewhere near him in the darkness . Occasionally Sylvia was disturbed by his agitation , and would question him about his dreams , having , like most of her class at that time , great faith in their prophetic interpretation ; but Philip never gave her any truth in his reply . After all , and though he did not acknowledge it even to himself , the long - desired happiness was not so delicious and perfect as he had anticipated . Many have felt the same in their first year of married life ; but the faithful , patient nature that still works on , striving to gain love , and capable itself of steady love all the while , is a gift not given to all . For many weeks after their wedding , Kester never came near them : a chance word or two from Sylvia showed Philip that she had noticed this and regretted it ; and , accordingly , he made it his business at the next leisure opportunity to go to Haytersbank ( never saying a word to his wife of his purpose ) , and seek out Kester . All the whole place was altered ! It was new white - washed , new thatched : the patches of colour in the surrounding ground were changed with altered tillage ; the great geraniums were gone from the window , and instead , was a smart knitted blind . Children played before the house - door ; a dog lying on the step flew at Philip ; all was so strange , that it was even the strangest thing of all for Kester to appear where everything else was so altered ! Philip had to put up with a good deal of crabbed behaviour on the part of the latter before he could induce Kester to promise to come down into the town and see Sylvia in her new home . Somehow , the visit when paid was but a failure ; at least , it seemed so at the time , though probably it broke the ice of restraint which was forming over the familiar intercourse between Kester and Sylvia . The old servant was daunted by seeing Sylvia in a strange place , and stood , sleeking his hair down , and furtively looking about him , instead of seating himself on the chair Sylvia had so eagerly brought forward for him . Then his sense of the estrangement caused by their new positions infected her , and she began to cry pitifully , saying,-- '
160637	160638	160617	160617	Kester	222	' '
160649	160660	160617	160617	Kester	222	' said Kester , thankful to have a subject started . '
160665	160674	160617	160617	Kester	222	' oud pasture - field , and are settin '
160677	160681	160718	160718	they	3972	' taters . They 're

160733	160842	160988	160988	He	222	' So they went on discoursing on Haytersbank and the old days , till Bell Robson , having finished her afternoon nap , came slowly down - stairs to join them ; and after that the conversation became so broken up , from the desire of the other two to attend and reply as best they could to her fragmentary and disjointed talk , that Kester took his leave before long ; falling , as he did so , into the formal and unnaturally respectful manner which he had adopted on first coming in . But Sylvia ran after him , and brought him back from the door . '

161315	162338	162704	162704	Jeremiah	204	' Having ended his oration , much to his own satisfaction , Kester tossed off his glass of wine , smacked his lips , wiped his mouth with the back of his hand , pocketed his cake , and made off . That night Sylvia spoke of his visit to her husband . Philip never said how he himself had brought it to pass , nor did he name the fact that he had heard the old man come in just as he himself had intended going into the parlour for tea , but had kept away , as he thought Sylvia and Kester would most enjoy their interview undisturbed . And Sylvia felt as if her husband 's silence was unsympathizing , and shut up the feelings that were just beginning to expand towards him . She sank again into the listless state of indifference from which nothing but some reference to former days , or present consideration for her mother , could rouse her . Hester was almost surprised at Sylvia 's evident liking for her . By slow degrees Hester was learning to love the woman , whose position as Philip 's wife she would have envied so keenly had she not been so truly good and pious . But Sylvia seemed as though she had given Hester her whole affection all at once . Hester could not understand this , while she was touched and melted by the trust it implied . For one thing Sylvia remembered and regretted -- her harsh treatment of Hester the rainy , stormy night on which the latter had come to Haytersbank to seek her and her mother , and bring them into Monkshaven to see the imprisoned father and husband . Sylvia had been struck with Hester 's patient endurance of her rudeness , a rudeness which she was conscious that she herself should have immediately and vehemently resented . Sylvia did not understand how a totally different character from hers might immediately forgive the anger she could not forget ; and because Hester had been so meek at the time , Sylvia , who knew how passing and transitory was her own anger , thought that all was forgotten ; while Hester believed that the words , which she herself could not have uttered except under deep provocation , meant much more than they did , and admired and wondered at Sylvia for having so entirely conquered her anger against her . Again , the two different women were divergently affected by the extreme fondness which Bell had shown towards Hester ever since Sylvia 's wedding - day . Sylvia , who had always received more love from others than she knew what to do with , had the most entire faith in her own supremacy in her mother 's heart , though at times Hester would do certain things more to the poor old woman 's satisfaction . Hester , who had craved for the affection which had been withheld from her , and had from that one circumstance become distrustful of her own power of inspiring regard , while she exaggerated the delight of being beloved , feared lest Sylvia should become jealous of her mother 's open display of great attachment and occasional preference for Hester . But such a thought never entered Sylvia 's mind . She was more thankful than she knew how to express towards any one who made her mother happy ; as has been already said , the contributing to Bell Robson 's pleasures earned Philip more of his wife 's smiles than anything else . And Sylvia threw her whole heart into the words and caresses she lavished on Hester whenever poor Mrs. Robson spoke of the goodness and kindness of the latter . Hester attributed more virtue to these sweet words and deeds of gratitude than they deserved ; they did not imply in Sylvia any victory over evil temptation , as they would have done in Hester . It seemed to be Sylvia 's fate to captivate more people than she cared to like back again . She turned the heads of John and Jeremiah Foster , who could hardly congratulate Philip enough on his choice of a wife . They had been prepared to be critical on one who had interfered with their favourite project of a marriage between Philip and Hester ; and , though full of compassion for the cruelty of Daniel Robson 's fate , they were too completely men of business not to have some apprehension that the connection of Philip Hepburn with the daughter of a man who was hanged , might injure the shop over which both his and their name appeared . But all the possible proprieties demanded that they should pay attention to the bride of their former shopman and present successor ; and the very first visitors whom Sylvia had received after her marriage had been John and Jeremiah Foster , in their sabbath - day clothes . They found her in the parlour ( so familiar to both of them ! ) clear - starching her mother 's caps , which had to be got up in some particular fashion that Sylvia was afraid of dictating to Phoebe . She was a little disturbed at her visitors discovering her at this employment ; but she was on her own ground , and that gave her self - possession ; and she welcomed the two old men so sweetly and modestly , and looked so pretty and feminine , and , besides , so notable in her handiwork , that she conquered all their prejudices at one blow ; and their first thought on leaving the shop was how to do her honour , by inviting her to a supper party at Jeremiah Foster 's house . Sylvia was dismayed when she was bidden to this wedding feast , and Philip had to use all his authority , though tenderly , to make her consent to go at all . She had been to merry country parties like the Corneys '
162696	162702	162704	162704	Jeremiah	204	' Now , Sylvia Hepburn , '
162706	162759	163838	163838	Philip	191	' I 've known thy husband long , and I do n't say but what thou hast done well in choosing him ; but if he ever neglects or ill - uses thee , come to me , and I 'll give him a sound lecture on his conduct . Mind , I 'm
162776	163071	163838	163838	Philip	191	' Philip smiled as if the day would never come when he should neglect or ill - use his darling ; Sylvia smiled a little , without much attending to , or caring for , the words that were detaining her , tired as she was ; John and Jeremiah chuckled over the joke ; but the words came up again in after days , as words idly spoken sometimes do . Before the end of that first year , Philip had learnt to be jealous of his wife 's new love for Hester . To the latter , Sylvia gave the free confidence on many things which Philip fancied she withheld from him . A suspicion crossed his mind , from time to time , that Sylvia might speak of her former lover to Hester . It would be not unnatural , he thought , if she did so , believing him to be dead ; but the idea irritated him . He was entirely mistaken , however ; Sylvia , with all her apparent frankness , kept her deep sorrows to herself . She never mentioned her father 's name , though he was continually present to her mind . Nor did she speak of Kinraid to human being , though , for his sake , her voice softened when , by chance , she spoke to a passing sailor ; and for his sake her eyes lingered on such men longer than on others , trying to discover in them something of the old familiar gait ; and partly for his dead sake , and partly because of the freedom of the outlook and the freshness of the air , she was glad occasionally to escape from the comfortable imprisonment of her '
163073	163837	163903	163903	Margaret	195	' , and the close streets around the market - place , and to mount the cliffs and sit on the turf , gazing abroad over the wide still expanse of the open sea ; for , at that height , even breaking waves only looked like broken lines of white foam on the blue watery plain . She did not want any companion on these rambles , which had somewhat of the delight of stolen pleasures ; for all the other respectable matrons and town - dwellers whom she knew were content to have always a business object for their walk , or else to stop at home in their own households ; and Sylvia was rather ashamed of her own yearnings for solitude and open air , and the sight and sound of the mother - like sea . She used to take off her hat , and sit there , her hands clasping her knees , the salt air lifting her bright curls , gazing at the distant horizon over the sea , in a sad dreaminess of thought ; if she had been asked on what she meditated , she could not have told you . But , by - and - by , the time came when she was a prisoner in the house ; a prisoner in her room , lying in bed with a little baby by her side -- her child , Philip 's child . His pride , his delight knew no bounds ; this was a new fast tie between them ; this would reconcile her to the kind of life that , with all its respectability and comfort , was so different from what she had lived before , and which Philip had often perceived that she felt to be dull and restraining . He already began to trace in the little girl , only a few days old , the lovely curves that he knew so well by heart in the mother 's face . Sylvia , too , pale , still , and weak , was very happy ; yes , really happy for the first time since her irrevocable marriage . For its irrevocableness had weighed much upon her with a sense of dull hopelessness ; she felt all Philip 's kindness , she was grateful to him for his tender regard towards her mother , she was learning to love him as well as to like and respect him . She did not know what else she could have done but marry so true a friend , and she and her mother so friendless ; but , at the same time , it was like lead on her morning spirits when she awoke and remembered that the decision was made , the dead was done , the choice taken which comes to most people but once in their lives . Now the little baby came in upon this state of mind like a ray of sunlight into a gloomy room . Even her mother was rejoiced and proud ; even with her crazed brain and broken heart , the sight of sweet , peaceful infancy brought light to her . All the old ways of holding a baby , of hushing it to sleep , of tenderly guarding its little limbs from injury , came back , like the habits of her youth , to Bell ; and she was never so happy or so easy in her mind , or so sensible and connected in her ideas , as when she had Sylvia 's baby in her arms . It was a pretty sight to see , however familiar to all of us such things may be -- the pale , worn old woman , in her quaint , old - fashioned country dress , holding the little infant on her knees , looking at its open , unspeculative eyes , and talking the little language to it as though it could understand ; the father on his knees , kept prisoner by a small , small finger curled round his strong and sinewy one , and gazing at the tiny creature with wondering idolatry ; the young mother , fair , pale , and smiling , propped up on pillows in order that she , too , might see the wonderful babe ; it was astonishing how the doctor could come and go without being drawn into the admiring vortex , and look at this baby just as if babies came into the world every day . '
163840	163876	163903	163903	Margaret	195	' said Sylvia , one night , as he sate as still as a mouse in her room , imagining her to be asleep . He was by her bed - side in a moment . '

164792	164876	164977	164977	Philip	191	' said Philip , coming forwards , striving to keep down the miserable complication of love and jealousy , and remorse and anger , that made his heart beat so wildly , and almost took him out of himself . Indeed , he must have been quite beside himself for the time , or he could never have gone on to utter the unwise , cruel words he did . But she spoke first , in a distressed and plaintive tone of voice . '
164917	164945	164983	164983	he	191	'm sure he 's alive somewheere ; he were so clear and life - like . Oh ! what shall I do ? what shall I do ? '

She looked at him with the mute reproach which some of us see ( God help us ! ) in the eyes of the dead , as they come before our sad memories in the night - season ; looked at him with such a solemn , searching look , never saying a word of reply or defence . Then she lay down , motionless and silent . He had been instantly stung with remorse for his speech ; the words were not beyond his lips when an agony had entered his heart ; but her steady , dilated eyes had kept him dumb and motionless as if by a spell . Now he rushed to the bed on which she lay , and half knelt , half threw himself upon it , imploring her to forgive him ; regardless for the time of any evil consequences to her , it seemed as if he must have her pardon -- her relenting -- at any price , even if they both died in the act of reconciliation . But she lay speechless , and , as far as she could be , motionless , the bed trembling under her with the quivering she could not still . Philip 's wild tones caught the nurse 's ears , and she entered full of the dignified indignation of wisdom . '

Every time she sate down to look at the sea , this process of thought was gone through up to this point ; the next step would , she knew , bring her to the question she dared not , must not ask . He was dead ; he must be dead ; for was she not Philip 's wife ? Then came up the recollection of Philip 's speech , never forgotten , only buried out of sight : '
167630	167641	168323	168323	Philip	191	' to go on dreaming of another man , and yo '
167646	168311	168381	168381	he	191	' She used to shudder as if cold steel had been plunged into her warm , living body as she remembered these words ; cruel words , harmlessly provoked . They were too much associated with physical pains to be dwelt upon ; only their memory was always there . She paid for these happy rambles with her baby by the depression which awaited her on her re - entrance into the dark , confined house that was her home ; its very fulness of comfort was an oppression . Then , when her husband saw her pale and fatigued , he was annoyed , and sometimes upbraided her for doing what was so unnecessary as to load herself with her child . She knew full well it was not that that caused her weariness . By - and - by , when he inquired and discovered that all these walks were taken in one direction , out towards the sea , he grew jealous of her love for the inanimate ocean . Was it connected in her mind with the thought of Kinraid ? Why did she so perseveringly , in wind or cold , go out to the sea - shore ; the western side , too , where , if she went but far enough , she would come upon the mouth of the Haytersbank gully , the point at which she had last seen Kinraid ? Such fancies haunted Philip 's mind for hours after she had acknowledged the direction of her walks . But he never said a word that could distinctly tell her he disliked her going to the sea , otherwise she would have obeyed him in this , as in everything else ; for absolute obedience to her husband seemed to be her rule of life at this period -- obedience to him who would so gladly have obeyed her smallest wish had she but expressed it ! She never knew that Philip had any painful association with the particular point on the sea - shore that she instinctively avoided , both from a consciousness of wifely duty , and also because the sight of it brought up so much sharp pain . Philip used to wonder if the dream that preceded her illness was the suggestive cause that drew her so often to the shore . Her illness consequent upon that dream had filled his mind , so that for many months he himself had had no haunting vision of Kinraid to disturb his slumbers . But now the old dream of Kinraid 's actual presence by Philip 's bedside began to return with fearful vividness . Night after night it recurred ; each time with some new touch of reality , and close approach ; till it was as if the fate that overtakes all men were then , even then , knocking at his door . In his business Philip prospered . Men praised him because he did well to himself . He had the perseverance , the capability for head - work and calculation , the steadiness and general forethought which might have made him a great merchant if he had lived in a large city . Without any effort of his own , almost , too , without Coulson 's being aware of it , Philip was now in the position of superior partner ; the one to suggest and arrange , while Coulson only carried out the plans that emanated from Philip . The whole work of life was suited to the man : he did not aspire to any different position , only to the full development of the capabilities of that which he already held . He had originated several fresh schemes with regard to the traffic of the shop ; and his old masters , with all their love of tried ways , and distrust of everything new , had been candid enough to confess that their successors '

169557	169724	169757	169757	she	4139	' Now in general Philip was the least particular of men about meals ; and to do Sylvia justice , she was scrupulously attentive to every household duty in which old Phoebe would allow her to meddle , and always careful to see after her husband 's comforts . But Philip was too vexed at her absence to perceive the injustice of what he was saying , nor was he aware how Bell Robson had been attending to what he said . But she was sadly discomfited by it , understanding just enough of the grievance in hand to think that her daughter was neglectful of those duties which she herself had always regarded as paramount to all others ; nor could Hester convince her that Philip had not meant what he said ; neither could she turn the poor old woman 's thoughts from the words which had caused her distress . Presently Sylvia came in , bright and cheerful , although breathless with hurry . '
169727	169737	169816	169816	Sylvie	188	' said she , taking off her wet shawl , '
169773	169808	169910	169910	Philip	191	' Hester began some speech of admiration for the child in order to prevent Bell from delivering the lecture she felt sure was coming down on the unsuspecting Sylvia ; but all in vain . '
169818	169853	169910	169910	Philip	191	' said Bell , in the way in which she had spoken to her daughter when she was a little child ; grave and severe in tone and look , more than in words . '

169966	170087	170146	170146	I	0	' Sylvia said no more , but the bright colour faded from her cheek , and the contraction of care returned to her brow . She occupied herself with taking off her baby 's walking things . Hester lingered , anxious to soothe and make peace ; she was looking sorrowfully at Sylvia , when she saw tears dropping on the baby 's cloak , and then it seemed as if she must speak a word of comfort before going to the shop - work , where she knew she was expected by both Philip and Coulson . She poured out a cup of tea , and coming close up to Sylvia , and kneeling down by her , she whispered,-- '

170501	170574	170615	170615	I	0	' Sylvia rose , and gave up the baby , which she had been suckling , to Nancy , who having done her washing , had come for her charge , to put it to bed . Sylvia kissed it fondly , making a little moan of sad , passionate tenderness as she did so . Then she took the cup of tea ; but she said , rather defiantly , to Hester,-- '
170595	170604	170752	170752	Thou	4155	' Then louder to her mother , she added,-- '
170623	170751	170829	170829	she	4155	' If the act itself was conciliatory , the spirit in which she was going to do it was the reverse . Hester followed her slowly into the ware - room , with intentional delay , thinking that her presence might be an obstacle to their mutually understanding one another . Sylvia held the cup and plate of bread and butter out to Philip , but avoided meeting his eye , and said not a word of explanation , or regret , or self - justification . If she had spoken , though ever so crossly , Philip would have been relieved , and would have preferred it to her silence . He wanted to provoke her to speech , but did not know how to begin . '
170764	170774	170919	170919	she	4155	' said he . She did not answer him . '

171042	171049	171070	171070	He	4161	' said he , almost fiercely , '
171053	171069	171070	171070	He	4161	' mean by what you 've said ? Speak ! I will have an answer . '

171117	171415	171570	171570	Kinraid	202	' Just at this moment Hester came up ; Philip was ashamed of his passionate ways in her serene presence , and loosened his grasp of his wife , and she ran away ; ran into her mother 's empty room , as to a solitary place , and there burst into that sobbing , miserable crying which we instinctively know is too surely lessening the length of our days on earth to be indulged in often . When she had exhausted that first burst and lay weak and quiet for a time , she listened in dreading expectation of the sound of his footstep coming in search of her to make friends . But he was detained below on business , and never came . Instead , her mother came clambering up the stairs ; she was now in the habit of going to bed between seven and eight , and to - night she was retiring at even an earlier hour . Sylvia sprang up and drew down the window - blind , and made her face and manner as composed as possible , in order to soothe and comfort her mother 's last waking hours . She helped her to bed with gentle patience ; the restraint imposed upon her by her tender filial love was good for her , though all the time she was longing to be alone to have another wild outburst . When her mother was going off to sleep , Sylvia went to look at her baby , also in a soft sleep . Then she gazed out at the evening sky , high above the tiled roofs of the opposite houses , and the longing to be out under the peaceful heavens took possession of her once more . '
171422	171428	171570	171570	Kinraid	202	' said she to herself ; '

172515	172747	172769	172769	their	4230	' Sylvia needed no second word ; a place was made for her , and in an instant more the rope was pulling against her hands till it seemed as though she was holding fire in her bare palms . Never a one of them thought of letting go for an instant , though when all was over many of their hands were raw and bleeding . Some strong , experienced fishermen passed a word along the line from time to time , giving directions as to how it should be held according to varying occasions ; but few among the rest had breath or strength enough to speak . The women and children that accompanied them ran on before , breaking down the loose stone fences , so as to obviate delay or hindrance ; they talked continually , exhorting , encouraging , explaining . From their many words and fragmentary sentences , Sylvia learnt that the vessel was supposed to be a Newcastle smack sailing from London , that had taken the dangerous inner channel to save time , and had been caught in the storm , which she was too crazy to withstand ; and that if by some daring contrivance of the fishermen who had first seen her the cable had not been got ashore , she would have been cast upon the rocks before this , and '

The fishermen sprang down the cliff to the quay - side , anxious to see the men whose lives they had saved ; the women , weary and over - excited , began to cry . Not Sylvia , however ; her fount of tears had been exhausted earlier in the day : her principal feeling was of gladness and high rejoicing that they were saved who had been so near to death not half an hour before . She would have liked to have seen the men , and shaken hands with them all round . But instead she must go home , and well would it be with her if she was in time for her husband 's supper , and escaped any notice of her absence . So she separated herself from the groups of women who sate on the grass in the churchyard , awaiting the return of such of their husbands as could resist the fascinations of the Monkshaven public houses . As Sylvia went down the church steps , she came upon one of the fishermen who had helped to tow the vessel into port . '

174598	174606	174786	174787	the Corneys	6656	' Well , go if thou will , '
174610	174630	175356	175356	Sylvia	188	' But get somewhat to eat first , and do n't hurry ; there 's no need for that . '
174788	175338	175356	175356	Sylvia	188	' kitchen in former times , than her mother 's orderly and quiet abode . Those little children were fatherless now ; and the house was shut up , awaiting the entry of some new tenant . There were no shutters to shut ; the long low window was blinking in the rays of the morning sun ; the house and cow - house doors were closed , and no poultry wandered about the field in search of stray grains of corn , or early worms . It was a strange and unfamiliar silence , and struck solemnly on Sylvia 's mind . Only a thrush in the old orchard down in the hollow , out of sight , whistled and gurgled with continual shrill melody . Sylvia went slowly past the house and down the path leading to the wild , deserted bit of garden . She saw that the last tenants had had a pump sunk for them , and resented the innovation , as though the well she was passing could feel the insult . Over it grew two hawthorn trees ; on the bent trunk of one of them she used to sit , long ago : the charm of the position being enhanced by the possible danger of falling into the well and being drowned . The rusty unused chain was wound round the windlass ; the bucket was falling to pieces from dryness . A lean cat came from some outhouse , and mewed pitifully with hunger ; accompanying Sylvia to the garden , as if glad of some human companionship , yet refusing to allow itself to be touched . Primroses grew in the sheltered places , just as they formerly did ; and made the uncultivated ground seem less deserted than the garden , where the last year 's weeds were rotting away , and cumbering the ground . Sylvia forced her way through the berry bushes to the herb - plot , and plucked the tender leaves she had come to seek ; sighing a little all the time . Then she retraced her steps ; paused softly before the house - door , and entered the porch and kissed the senseless wood . She tried to tempt the poor gaunt cat into her arms , meaning to carry it home and befriend it ; but it was scared by her endeavour and ran back to its home in the outhouse , making a green path across the white dew of the meadow . Then Sylvia began to hasten home , thinking , and remembering -- at the stile that led into the road she was brought short up . Some one stood in the lane just on the other side of the gap ; his back was to the morning sun ; all she saw at first was the uniform of a naval officer , so well known in Monkshaven in those days . Sylvia went hurrying past him , not looking again , although her clothes almost brushed his , as he stood there still . She had not gone a yard -- no , not half a yard -- when her heart leaped up and fell again dead within her , as if she had been shot . '
175341	175355	175967	175968	My love	6464	' he said , in a voice tremulous with joy and passionate love . '
175358	175684	175999	175999	I	0	' She looked round ; he had turned a little , so that the light fell straight on his face . It was bronzed , and the lines were strengthened ; but it was the same face she had last seen in Haytersbank Gully three long years ago , and had never thought to see in life again . He was close to her and held out his fond arms ; she went fluttering towards their embrace , as if drawn by the old fascination ; but when she felt them close round her , she started away , and cried out with a great pitiful shriek , and put her hands up to her forehead as if trying to clear away some bewildering mist . Then she looked at him once more , a terrible story in her eyes , if he could but have read it . Twice she opened her stiff lips to speak , and twice the words were overwhelmed by the surges of her misery , which bore them back into the depths of her heart . He thought that he had come upon her too suddenly , and he attempted to soothe her with soft murmurs of love , and to woo her to his outstretched hungry arms once more . But when she saw this motion of his , she made a gesture as though pushing him away ; and with an inarticulate moan of agony she put her hands to her head once more , and turning away began to run blindly towards the town for protection . For a minute or so he was stunned with surprise at her behaviour ; and then he thought it accounted for by the shock of his accost , and that she needed time to understand the unexpected joy . So he followed her swiftly , ever keeping her in view , but not trying to overtake her too speedily . '
175692	175966	176064	176064	he	0	' he kept thinking . And by this thought he tried to repress his impatience and check the speed he longed to use ; yet he was always so near behind that her quickened sense heard his well - known footsteps following , and a mad notion flashed across her brain that she would go to the wide full river , and end the hopeless misery she felt enshrouding her . There was a sure hiding - place from all human reproach and heavy mortal woe beneath the rushing waters borne landwards by the morning tide . No one can tell what changed her course ; perhaps the thought of her sucking child ; perhaps her mother ; perhaps an angel of God ; no one on earth knows , but as she ran along the quay - side she all at once turned up an entry , and through an open door . He , following all the time , came into a quiet dark parlour , with a cloth and tea - things on the table ready for breakfast ; the change from the bright sunny air out of doors to the deep shadow of this room made him think for the first moment that she had passed on , and that no one was there , and he stood for an instant baffled , and hearing no sound but the beating of his own heart ; but an irrepressible sobbing gasp made him look round , and there he saw her cowered behind the door , her face covered tight up , and sharp shudders going through her whole frame .

176263	176283	176368	176368	he	1365	' she asked , in slow , hoarse tones , as if her voice were half strangled within her . '
176286	176321	176467	176467	Philip	191	' said he , a red light coming into his eyes , as he bent his looks upon her ; now , indeed , a true and not an assumed suspicion entering his mind . '
176324	176355	176479	176479	Philip	191	' he repeated ; then , coming a step nearer to her , and taking her hand , not tenderly this time , but with a resolution to be satisfied . '
176399	176466	176720	176720	Philip	191	' Between every clause of this speech he paused and gasped for her answer ; but none came . Her eyes dilated and held his steady gaze prisoner as with a magical charm -- neither could look away from the other 's wild , searching gaze . When he had ended , she was silent for a moment , then she cried out , shrill and fierce,-- '
176469	176478	176720	176720	Philip	191	' No answer . Wilder and shriller still , '
176481	176719	176729	176729	Kinraid	202	' she cried . He was in the distant ware - room completing the last night 's work before the regular shop hours began ; before breakfast , also , that his wife might not find him waiting and impatient . He heard her cry ; it cut through doors , and still air , and great bales of woollen stuff ; he thought that she had hurt herself , that her mother was worse , that her baby was ill , and he hastened to the spot whence the cry proceeded . On opening the door that separated the shop from the sitting - room , he saw the back of a naval officer , and his wife on the ground , huddled up in a heap ; when she perceived him come in , she dragged herself up by means of a chair , groping like a blind person , and came and stood facing him . The officer turned fiercely round , and would have come towards Philip , who was so bewildered by the scene that even yet he did not understand who the stranger was , did not perceive for an instant that he saw the realization of his greatest dread . But Sylvia laid her hand on Kinraid 's arm , and assumed to herself the right of speech . Philip did not know her voice , it was so changed . '

179312	180582	180891	180892	some one	1489	' A murmur of applause and interest and rejoicing buzzed all around Philip . All this was publicly known about Kinraid,--and how much more ? All Monkshaven might hear tomorrow -- nay , to - day -- of Philip 's treachery to the hero of the hour ; how he had concealed his fate , and supplanted him in his love . Philip shrank from the burst of popular indignation which he knew must follow . Any wrong done to one who stands on the pinnacle of the people 's favour is resented by each individual as a personal injury ; and among a primitive set of country - folk , who recognize the wild passion in love , as it exists untamed by the trammels of reason and self - restraint , any story of baulked affections , or treachery in such matters , spreads like wildfire . Philip knew this quite well ; his doom of disgrace lay plain before him , if only Kinraid spoke the word . His head was bent down while he thus listened and reflected . He half resolved on doing something ; he lifted up his head , caught the reflection of his face in the little strip of glass on the opposite side , in which the women might look at themselves in their contemplated purchases , and quite resolved . The sight he saw in the mirror was his own long , sad , pale face , made plainer and grayer by the heavy pressure of the morning 's events . He saw his stooping figure , his rounded shoulders , with something like a feeling of disgust at his personal appearance as he remembered the square , upright build of Kinraid ; his fine uniform , with epaulette and sword - belt ; his handsome brown face ; his dark eyes , splendid with the fire of passion and indignation ; his white teeth , gleaming out with the terrible smile of scorn . The comparison drove Philip from passive hopelessness to active despair . He went abruptly from the crowded shop into the empty parlour , and on into the kitchen , where he took up a piece of bread , and heedless of Phoebe 's look and words , began to eat it before he even left the place ; for he needed the strength that food would give ; he needed it to carry him out of the sight and the knowledge of all who might hear what he had done , and point their fingers at him . He paused a moment in the parlour , and then , setting his teeth tight together , he went upstairs . First of all he went into the bit of a room opening out of theirs , in which his baby slept . He dearly loved the child , and many a time would run in and play a while with it ; and in such gambols he and Sylvia had passed their happiest moments of wedded life . The little Bella was having her morning slumber ; Nancy used to tell long afterwards how he knelt down by the side of her cot , and was so strange she thought he must have prayed , for all it was nigh upon eleven o'clock , and folk in their senses only said their prayers when they got up , and when they went to bed . Then he rose , and stooped over , and gave the child a long , lingering , soft , fond kiss . And on tip - toe he passed away into the room where his aunt lay ; his aunt who had been so true a friend to him ! He was thankful to know that in her present state she was safe from the knowledge of what was past , safe from the sound of the shame to come . He had not meant to see Sylvia again ; he dreaded the look of her hatred , her scorn , but there , outside her mother 's bed , she lay , apparently asleep . Mrs. Robson , too , was sleeping , her face towards the wall . Philip could not help it ; he went to have one last look at his wife . She was turned towards her mother , her face averted from him ; he could see the tear - stains , the swollen eyelids , the lips yet quivering : he stooped down , and bent to kiss the little hand that lay listless by her side . As his hot breath neared that hand it was twitched away , and a shiver ran through the whole prostrate body . And then he knew that she was not asleep , only worn out by her misery,--misery that he had caused . He sighed heavily ; but he went away , down - stairs , and away for ever . Only as he entered the parlour his eyes caught on two silhouettes , one of himself , one of Sylvia , done in the first month of their marriage , by some wandering artist , if so he could be called . They were hanging against the wall in little oval wooden frames ; black profiles , with the lights done in gold ; about as poor semblances of humanity as could be conceived ; but Philip went up , and after looking for a minute or so at Sylvia 's , he took it down , and buttoned his waistcoat over it . It was the only thing he took away from his home . He went down the entry on to the quay . The river was there , and waters , they say , have a luring power , and a weird promise of rest in their perpetual monotony of sound . But many people were there , if such a temptation presented itself to Philip 's mind ; the sight of his fellow - townsmen , perhaps of his acquaintances , drove him up another entry -- the town is burrowed with such -- back into the High Street , which he straightway crossed into a well - known court , out of which rough steps led to the summit of the hill , and on to the fells and moors beyond . He plunged and panted up this rough ascent . From the top he could look down on the whole town lying below , severed by the bright shining river into two parts . To the right lay the sea , shimmering and heaving ; there were the cluster of masts rising out of the little port ; the irregular roofs of the houses ; which of them , thought he , as he carried his eye along the quay - side to the market - place , which of them was his ? and he singled it out in its unfamiliar aspect , and saw the thin blue smoke rising from the kitchen chimney , where even now Phoebe was cooking the household meal that he never more must share . Up at that thought and away , he knew not nor cared not whither . He went through the ploughed fields where the corn was newly springing ; he came down upon the vast sunny sea , and turned his back upon it with loathing ; he made his way inland to the high green pastures ; the short upland turf above which the larks hung poised '
180587	180873	180943	180944	the man	5588	' . He strode along , so straight and heedless of briar and bush , that the wild black cattle ceased from grazing , and looked after him with their great blank puzzled eyes . He had passed all enclosures and stone fences now , and was fairly on the desolate brown moors ; through the withered last year 's ling and fern , through the prickly gorse , he tramped , crushing down the tender shoots of this year 's growth , and heedless of the startled plover 's cry , goaded by the furies . His only relief from thought , from the remembrance of Sylvia 's looks and words , was in violent bodily action . So he went on till evening shadows and ruddy evening lights came out upon the wild fells . He had crossed roads and lanes , with a bitter avoidance of men 's tracks ; but now the strong instinct of self - preservation came out , and his aching limbs , his weary heart , giving great pants and beats for a time , and then ceasing altogether till a mist swam and quivered before his aching eyes , warned him that he must find some shelter and food , or lie down to die . He fell down now , often ; stumbling over the slightest obstacle . He had passed the cattle pastures ; he was among the black - faced sheep ; and they , too , ceased nibbling , and looked after him , and somehow , in his poor wandering imagination , their silly faces turned to likenesses of Monkshaven people -- people who ought to be far , far away .

Sylvia cried out for help ; Nancy came , the baby in her arms . They had been in several times before that morning ; and the child came smiling and crowing at its mother , who was supporting her own dying parent . '
182657	182661	182681	182681	Nancy	218	' said Sylvia ; '

182719	182980	183069	183069	He	191	' This appeared to be no news to Sylvia , and yet the words came on her with a great shock , but for all that she could not cry ; she was surprised herself at her own deadness of feeling . Her baby crawled to her , and she had to hold and guard both her mother and her child . It seemed a long , long time before any one came , and then she heard muffled voices , and a heavy tramp : it was Phoebe leading the doctor upstairs , and Nancy creeping in behind to hear his opinion . He did not ask many questions , and Phoebe replied more frequently to his inquiries than did Sylvia , who looked into his face with a blank , tearless , speechless despair , that gave him more pain than the sight of her dying mother . The long decay of Mrs. Robson 's faculties and health , of which he was well aware , had in a certain manner prepared him for some such sudden termination of the life whose duration was hardly desirable , although he gave several directions as to her treatment ; but the white , pinched face , the great dilated eye , the slow comprehension of the younger woman , struck him with alarm ; and he went on asking for various particulars , more with a view of rousing Sylvia , if even it were to tears , than for any other purpose that the information thus obtained could answer . '
183018	183059	183093	183093	He	191	' Sylvia 's terrible stare continued : he put his advice into action , and gently tried to loosen her clasp , and tender hold . This she resisted ; laying her cheek against her poor mother 's unconscious face . '
183064	183068	182998	182998	she	4423	' said he . '
183075	183092	182998	182998	she	4423	' Phoebe looked at Nancy , Nancy at Phoebe . It was the latter who replied , '

183159	183261	183281	183281	He	4120	' he said , suddenly . Nancy had taken her up off the bed where she had been sitting , encircled by her mother 's arm . The nursemaid gave her to the doctor . He watched the mother 's eye , it followed her child , and he was rejoiced . He gave a little pinch to the baby 's soft flesh , and she cried out piteously ; again the same action , the same result . Sylvia laid her mother down , and stretched out her arms for her child , hushing it , and moaning over it . '
183267	183274	183713	183713	you	4431	' said Dr Morgan to himself . '
183287	183677	183737	183737	she	5589	' He went down - stairs to make inquiry for Philip ; that poor young creature , about whose health he had never felt thoroughly satisfied since the fever after her confinement , was in an anxious condition , and with an inevitable shock awaiting her . Her husband ought to be with her , and supporting her to bear it . Dr Morgan went into the shop . Hester alone was there . Coulson had gone to his comfortable dinner at his well - ordered house , with his common - place wife . If he had felt anxious about Philip 's looks and strange disappearance , he had also managed to account for them in some indifferent way . Hester was alone with the shop - boy ; few people came in during the universal Monkshaven dinner - hour . She was resting her head on her hand , and puzzled and distressed about many things -- all that was implied by the proceedings of the evening before between Philip and Sylvia ; and that was confirmed by Philip 's miserable looks and strange abstracted ways to - day . Oh ! how easy Hester would have found it to make him happy ! not merely how easy , but what happiness it would have been to her to merge her every wish into the one great object of fulfiling his will . To her , an on - looker , the course of married life , which should lead to perfect happiness , seemed to plain ! Alas ! it is often so ! and the resisting forces which make all such harmony and delight impossible are not recognized by the bystanders , hardly by the actors . But if these resisting forces are only superficial , or constitutional , they are but the necessary discipline here , and do not radically affect the love which will make all things right in heaven . Some glimmering of this latter comforting truth shed its light on Hester 's troubled thoughts from time to time . But again , how easy would it have been to her to tread the maze that led to Philip 's happiness ; and how difficult it seemed to the wife he had chosen ! She was aroused by Dr Morgan 's voice . '

183860	184282	184385	184385	He	0	' No ! the messenger brought back word that he had not been seen at their bank all morning . Further inquiries were made by the anxious Hester , by the doctor , by Coulson ; all they could learn was that Phoebe had seen him pass the kitchen window about eleven o'clock , when she was peeling the potatoes for dinner ; and two lads playing on the quay - side thought they had seen him among a group of sailors ; but these latter , as far as they could be identified , had no knowledge of his appearance among them . Before night the whole town was excited about his disappearance . Before night Bell Robson had gone to her long home . And Sylvia still lay quiet and tearless , apparently more unmoved than any other creature by the events of the day , and the strange vanishing of her husband . The only thing she seemed to care for was her baby ; she held it tight in her arms , and Dr Morgan bade them leave it there , its touch might draw the desired tears into her weary , sleepless eyes , and charm the aching pain out of them . They were afraid lest she should inquire for her husband , whose non - appearance at such a time of sorrow to his wife must ( they thought ) seem strange to her . And night drew on while they were all in this state . She had gone back to her own room without a word when they had desired her to do so ; caressing her child in her arms , and sitting down on the first chair she came to , with a heavy sigh , as if even this slight bodily exertion had been too much for her . They saw her eyes turn towards the door every time it was opened , and they thought it was with anxious expectation of one who could not be found , though many were seeking for him in all probable places . When night came some one had to tell her of her husband 's disappearance ; and Dr Morgan was the person who undertook this . He came into her room about nine o'clock ; her baby was sleeping in her arms ; she herself pale as death , still silent and tearless , though strangely watchful of gestures and sounds , and probably cognizant of more than they imagined .

No one could do more than remonstrate : no one had sufficient authority to interfere with her . Dr Morgan even thought that she might possibly be roused to tears by the occasion ; only he begged Hester to go with her , that she might have the solace of some woman 's company . She went through the greater part of the ceremony in the same hard , unmoved manner in which she had received everything for days past . But on looking up once , as they formed round the open grave , she saw Kester , in his Sunday clothes , with a bit of new crape round his hat , crying as if his heart would break over the coffin of his good , kind mistress . His evident distress , the unexpected sight , suddenly loosed the fountain of Sylvia 's tears , and her sobs grew so terrible that Hester feared she would not be able to remain until the end of the funeral . But she struggled hard to stay till the last , and then she made an effort to go round by the place where Kester stood . '
185967	186018	186066	186066	Kester	222	' was all she could say for crying : and Kester only nodded his head -- he could not speak a word . CHAPTER XXXVI MYSTERIOUS TIDINGS That very evening Kester came , humbly knocking at the kitchen - door . Phoebe opened it . He asked to see Sylvia . '
186028	186032	186066	186066	Kester	222	' said Phoebe . '
186037	186054	186080	186080	she	4475	' her out ; sometimes she 's for one thing , sometimes she 's for another . '
186055	186064	186080	186080	she	4475	' She bid me come and see her , '

186086	186231	186284	186284	Kester	222	' So Phoebe went off to inform Sylvia that Kester was there ; and returned with the desire that he would walk into the parlour . An instant after he was gone , Phoebe heard him return , and carefully shut the two doors of communication between the kitchen and sitting - room . Sylvia was in the latter when Kester came in , holding her baby close to her ; indeed , she seldom let it go now - a - days to any one else , making Nancy 's place quite a sinecure , much to Phoebe 's indignation . Sylvia 's face was shrunk , and white , and thin ; her lovely eyes alone retained the youthful , almost childlike , expression . She went up to Kester , and shook his horny hand , she herself trembling all over . '
186240	186245	186284	186284	Kester	222	' she said hastily . '
186265	186283	186284	186284	Kester	222	' She began to cry , and then cheered herself up , and swallowed down her sobs . '

188004	188104	188297	188297	Your	4510	' She whispered soft in the little one 's ear as she took her upstairs to bed . About three weeks after the miserable date of Bell Robson 's death and Philip 's disappearance , Hester Rose received a letter from him . She knew the writing on the address well ; and it made her tremble so much that it was many minutes before she dared to open it , and make herself acquainted with the facts it might disclose . But she need not have feared ; there were no facts told , unless the vague date of '
188106	188144	188297	188297	Your	4510	' might be something to learn . Even that much might have been found out by the post - mark , only she had been too much taken by surprise to examine it . It ran as follows:-- '
188147	188296	188312	188312	Hester	209	' Tell those whom it may concern , that I have left Monkshaven for ever . No one need trouble themselves about me ; I am provided for . Please to make my humble apologies to my kind friends , the Messrs Foster , and to my partner , William Coulson . Please to accept of my love , and to join the same to your mother . Please to give my particular and respectful duty and kind love to my aunt Isabella Robson . Her daughter Sylvia knows what I have always felt , and shall always feel , for her better than I can ever put into language , so I send her no message ; God bless and keep my child . You must all look on me as one dead ; as I am to you , and maybe shall soon be in reality . '
188305	188309	188360	188360	She	188	' PHILIP HEPBURN . '
188324	188328	189276	189277	some one	1489	' my wife , '
188366	189100	189276	189277	some one	1489	' Hester read this letter again and again , till her heart caught the echo of its hopelessness , and sank within her . She put it in her pocket , and reflected upon it all the day long as she served in the shop . The customers found her as gentle , but far more inattentive than usual . She thought that in the evening she would go across the bridge , and consult with the two good old brothers Foster . But something occurred to put off the fulfilment of this plan . That same morning Sylvia had preceded her , with no one to consult , because consultation would have required previous confidence , and confidence would have necessitated such a confession about Kinraid as it was most difficult for Sylvia to make . The poor young wife yet felt that some step must be taken by her ; and what it was to be she could not imagine . She had no home to go to ; for as Philip was gone away , she remained where she was only on sufferance ; she did not know what means of livelihood she had ; she was willing to work , nay , would be thankful to take up her old life of country labour ; but with her baby , what could she do ? In this dilemma , the recollection of the old man 's kindly speech and offer of assistance , made , it is true , half in joke , at the end of her wedding visit , came into her mind ; and she resolved to go and ask for some of the friendly counsel and assistance then offered . It would be the first time of her going out since her mother 's funeral , and she dreaded the effort on that account . More even than on that account did she shrink from going into the streets again . She could not get over the impression that Kinraid must be lingering near ; and she distrusted herself so much that it was a positive terror to think of meeting him again . She felt as though , if she but caught a sight of him , the glitter of his uniform , or heard his well - known voice in only a distant syllable of talk , her heart would stop , and she should die from very fright of what would come next . Or rather so she felt , and so she thought before she took her baby in her arms , as Nancy gave it to her after putting on its out - of - door attire . With it in her arms she was protected , and the whole current of her thoughts was changed . The infant was wailing and suffering with its teething , and the mother 's heart was so occupied in soothing and consoling her moaning child , that the dangerous quay - side and the bridge were passed almost before she was aware ; nor did she notice the eager curiosity and respectful attention of those she met who recognized her even through the heavy veil which formed part of the draping mourning provided for her by Hester and Coulson , in the first unconscious days after her mother 's death . Though public opinion as yet reserved its verdict upon Philip 's disappearance -- warned possibly by Kinraid 's story against hasty decisions and judgments in such times as those of war and general disturbance -- yet every one agreed that no more pitiful fate could have befallen Philip 's wife . Marked out by her striking beauty as an object of admiring interest even in those days when she sate in girlhood 's smiling peace by her mother at the Market Cross -- her father had lost his life in a popular cause , and ignominious as the manner of his death might be , he was looked upon as a martyr to his zeal in avenging the wrongs of his townsmen ; Sylvia had married amongst them too , and her quiet daily life was well known to them ; and now her husband had been carried off from her side just on the very day when she needed his comfort most . For the general opinion was that Philip had been '

Alice Rose was slowly failing , and the long days which she had to spend alone told much upon her spirits , and consequently upon her health . All this came out in the conversation which ensued after reading Hepburn 's letter in the little parlour at the bank on the day after Sylvia had had her confidential interview with Jeremiah Foster . He was a true man of honour , and never so much as alluded to her visit to him ; but what she had then told him influenced him very much in the formation of the project which he proposed to his brother and Hester . He recommended her remaining where she was , living still in the house behind the shop ; for he thought within himself that she might have exaggerated the effect of her words upon Philip ; that , after all , it might have been some cause totally disconnected with them , which had blotted out her husband 's place among the men of Monkshaven ; and that it would be so much easier for both to resume their natural relations , both towards each other and towards the world , if Sylvia remained where her husband had left her -- in an expectant attitude , so to speak . Jeremiah Foster questioned Hester straitly about her letter : whether she had made known its contents to any one . No , not to any one . Neither to her mother nor to William Coulson ? No , to neither . She looked at him as she replied to his inquiries , and he looked at her , each wondering if the other could be in the least aware that a conjugal quarrel might be at the root of the dilemma in which they were placed by Hepburn 's disappearance . But neither Hester , who had witnessed the misunderstanding between the husband and wife on the evening , before the morning on which Philip went away , nor Jeremiah Foster , who had learnt from Sylvia the true reason of her husband 's disappearance , gave the slightest reason to the other to think that they each supposed they had a clue to the reason of Hepburn 's sudden departure . What Jeremiah Foster , after a night 's consideration , had to propose was this ; that Hester and her mother should come and occupy the house in the market - place , conjointly with Sylvia and her child . Hester 's interest in the shop was by this time acknowledged . Jeremiah had made over to her so much of his share in the business , that she had a right to be considered as a kind of partner ; and she had long been the superintendent of that department of goods which were exclusively devoted to women . So her daily presence was requisite for more reasons than one . Yet her mother 's health and spirits were such as to render it unadvisable that the old woman should be too much left alone ; and Sylvia 's devotion to her own mother seemed to point her out as the very person who could be a gentle and tender companion to Alice Rose during those hours when her own daughter would necessarily be engaged in the shop . Many desirable objects seemed to be gained by this removal of Alice : an occupation was provided for Sylvia , which would detain her in the place where her husband had left her , and where ( Jeremiah Foster fairly expected in spite of his letter ) he was likely to come back to find her ; and Alice Rose , the early love of one of the brothers , the old friend of the other , would be well cared for , and under her daughter 's immediate supervision during the whole of the time that she was occupied in the shop . Philip 's share of the business , augmented by the money which he had put in from the legacy of his old Cumberland uncle , would bring in profits enough to support Sylvia and her child in ease and comfort until that time , which they all anticipated , when he should return from his mysterious wandering -- mysterious , whether his going forth had been voluntary or involuntary . Thus far was settled ; and Jeremiah Foster went to tell Sylvia of the plan . She was too much a child , too entirely unaccustomed to any independence of action , to do anything but leave herself in his hands . Her very confession , made to him the day before , when she sought his counsel , seemed to place her at his disposal . Otherwise , she had had notions of the possibility of a free country life once more -- how provided for and arranged she hardly knew ; but Haytersbank was to let , and Kester disengaged , and it had just seemed possible that she might have to return to her early home , and to her old life . She knew that it would take much money to stock the farm again , and that her hands were tied from much useful activity by the love and care she owed to her baby . But still , somehow , she hoped and she fancied , till Jeremiah Foster 's measured words and carefully - arranged plan made her silently relinquish her green , breezy vision . Hester , too , had her own private rebellion -- hushed into submission by her gentle piety . If Sylvia had been able to make Philip happy , Hester could have felt lovingly and almost gratefully towards her ; but Sylvia had failed in this . Philip had been made unhappy , and was driven forth a wanderer into the wide world -- never to come back ! And his last words to Hester , the postscript of his letter , containing the very pith of it , was to ask her to take charge and care of the wife whose want of love towards him had uprooted him from the place where he was valued and honoured . It cost Hester many a struggle and many a self - reproach before she could make herself feel what she saw all along -- that in everything Philip treated her like a sister . But even a sister might well be indignant if she saw her brother 's love disregarded and slighted , and his life embittered by the thoughtless conduct of a wife ! Still Hester fought against herself , and for Philip 's sake she sought to see the good in Sylvia , and she strove to love her as well as to take care of her . With the baby , of course , the case was different . Without thought or struggle , or reason , every one loved the little girl . Coulson and his buxom wife , who were childless , were never weary of making much of her . Hester 's happiest hours were spent with that little child . Jeremiah Foster almost looked upon her as his own from the day when she honoured him by yielding to the temptation of the chain and seal , and coming to his knee ; not a customer to the shop but knew the smiling child 's sad history , and many a country - woman would save a rosy - cheeked apple from out her store that autumn to bring it on next market - day for '
193749	193850	194849	194849	you	4604	' Even stern Alice Rose was graciously inclined towards the little Bella ; and though her idea of the number of the elect was growing narrower and narrower every day , she would have been loth to exclude the innocent little child , that stroked her wrinkled cheeks so softly every night in return for her blessing , from the few that should be saved . Nay , for the child 's sake , she relented towards the mother ; and strove to have Sylvia rescued from the many castaways with fervent prayer , or , as she phrased it , '
193855	194845	194873	194873	I	0	' . Alice had a sort of instinct that the little child , so tenderly loved by , so fondly loving , the mother whose ewe - lamb she was , could not be even in heaven without yearning for the creature she had loved best on earth ; and the old woman believed that this was the principal reason for her prayers for Sylvia ; but unconsciously to herself , Alice Rose was touched by the filial attentions she constantly received from the young mother , whom she believed to be foredoomed to condemnation . Sylvia rarely went to church or chapel , nor did she read her Bible ; for though she spoke little of her ignorance , and would fain , for her child 's sake , have remedied it now it was too late , she had lost what little fluency of reading she had ever had , and could only make out her words with much spelling and difficulty . So the taking her Bible in hand would have been a mere form ; though of this Alice Rose knew nothing . No one knew much of what was passing in Sylvia ; she did not know herself . Sometimes in the nights she would waken , crying , with a terrible sense of desolation ; every one who loved her , or whom she had loved , had vanished out of her life ; every one but her child , who lay in her arms , warm and soft . But then Jeremiah Foster 's words came upon her ; words that she had taken for cursing at the time ; and she would so gladly have had some clue by which to penetrate the darkness of the unknown region from whence both blessing and cursing came , and to know if she had indeed done something which should cause her sin to be visited on that soft , sweet , innocent darling . If any one would teach her to read ! If any one would explain to her the hard words she heard in church or chapel , so that she might find out the meaning of sin and godliness!--words that had only passed over the surface of her mind till now ! For her child 's sake she should like to do the will of God , if she only knew what that was , and how to be worked out in her daily life . But there was no one she dared confess her ignorance to and ask information from . Jeremiah Foster had spoken as if her child , sweet little merry Bella , with a loving word and a kiss for every one , was to suffer heavily for the just and true words her wronged and indignant mother had spoken . Alice always spoke as if there were no hope for her ; and blamed her , nevertheless , for not using the means of grace that it was not in her power to avail herself of . And Hester , that Sylvia would fain have loved for her uniform gentleness and patience with all around her , seemed so cold in her unruffled and undemonstrative behaviour ; and moreover , Sylvia felt that Hester blamed her perpetual silence regarding Philip 's absence without knowing how bitter a cause Sylvia had for casting him off . The only person who seemed to have pity upon her was Kester ; and his pity was shown in looks rather than words ; for when he came to see her , which he did from time to time , by a kind of mutual tacit consent , they spoke but little of former days . He was still lodging with his sister , widow Dobson , working at odd jobs , some of which took him into the country for weeks at a time . But on his returns to Monkshaven he was sure to come and see her and the little Bella ; indeed , when his employment was in the immediate neighbourhood of the town , he never allowed a week to pass away without a visit . There was not much conversation between him and Sylvia at such times . They skimmed over the surface of the small events in which both took an interest ; only now and then a sudden glance , a checked speech , told each that there were deeps not forgotten , although they were never mentioned . Twice Sylvia -- below her breath -- had asked Kester , just as she was holding the door open for his departure , if anything had ever been heard of Kinraid since his one night 's visit to Monkshaven : each time ( and there was an interval of some months between the inquiries ) the answer had been simply , no . To no one else would Sylvia ever have named his name . But indeed she had not the chance , had she wished it ever so much , of asking any questions about him from any one likely to know . The Corneys had left Moss Brow at Martinmas , and gone many miles away towards Horncastle . Bessy Corney , it is true was married and left behind in the neighbourhood ; but with her Sylvia had never been intimate ; and what girlish friendship there might have been between them had cooled very much at the time of Kinraid 's supposed death three years before . One day before Christmas in this year , 1798 , Sylvia was called into the shop by Coulson , who , with his assistant , was busy undoing the bales of winter goods supplied to them from the West Riding , and other places . He was looking at a fine Irish poplin dress - piece when Sylvia answered to his call . '

195038	195113	195114	195114	It	4607	' Sylvia did not say anything but that it was very pretty , in a low voice , and then she quickly left the shop , much to Coulson 's displeasure . All the afternoon she was unusually quiet and depressed . Alice Rose , sitting helpless in her chair , watched her with keen eyes . At length , after one of Sylvia 's deep , unconscious sighs , the old woman spoke : '
195134	195135	195114	195114	It	4607	' '
195138	195154	195114	195114	It	4607	' said Sylvia , looking up , startled to find herself an object of notice . '
195157	195173	195186	195186	I	0	' ( The answer was not quite so ready as the precept had been . ) '

195191	195204	195272	195272	Sylvia	188	' said Sylvia , too desperate any longer to conceal her ignorance . '
195226	195265	195209	195209	thee	4609	' this life are crooked ! There was our Hester , as can read as well as any minister , and Philip passes over her to go and choose a young lass as can not read her Bible . '

195295	195325	195334	195334	Sylvia	188	' Many a time and oft have I seen Hester take comfort in her Bible when Philip was following after thee . She knew where to go for consolation . '
195326	195332	195334	195334	Sylvia	188	' I 'd fain read , '
195338	195354	195209	195209	thee	4609	' if anybody would learn me ; for perhaps it might do me good ; I 'm
195359	196483	196508	196508	she	209	' Her eyes , as she looked up at Alice 's stern countenance , were full of tears . The old woman saw it , and was touched , although she did not immediately show her sympathy . But she took her own time , and made no reply . The next day , however , she bade Sylvia come to her , and then and there , as if her pupil had been a little child , she began to teach Sylvia to read the first chapter of Genesis ; for all other reading but the Scriptures was as vanity to her , and she would not condescend to the weakness of other books . Sylvia was now , as ever , slow at book - learning ; but she was meek and desirous to be taught , and her willingness in this respect pleased Alice , and drew her singularly towards one who , from being a pupil , might become a convert . All this time Sylvia never lost the curiosity that had been excited by the few words Alice had let drop about Hester and Philip , and by degrees she approached the subject again , and had the idea then started confirmed by Alice , who had no scruple in using the past experience of her own , of her daughter 's , or of any one 's life , as an instrument to prove the vanity of setting the heart on anything earthly . This knowledge , unsuspected before , sank deep into Sylvia 's thoughts , and gave her a strange interest in Hester -- poor Hester , whose life she had so crossed and blighted , even by the very blighting of her own . She gave Hester her own former passionate feelings for Kinraid , and wondered how she herself should have felt towards any one who had come between her and him , and wiled his love away . When she remembered Hester 's unfailing sweetness and kindness towards herself from the very first , she could better bear the comparative coldness of her present behaviour . She tried , indeed , hard to win back the favour she had lost ; but the very means she took were blunders , and only made it seem to her as if she could never again do right in Hester 's eyes . For instance , she begged her to accept and wear the pretty poplin gown which had been Philip 's especial choice ; feeling within herself as if she should never wish to put it on , and as if the best thing she could do with it was to offer it to Hester . But Hester rejected the proffered gift with as much hardness of manner as she was capable of assuming ; and Sylvia had to carry it upstairs and lay it by for the little daughter , who , Hester said , might perhaps learn to value things that her father had given especial thought to . Yet Sylvia went on trying to win Hester to like her once more ; it was one of her great labours , and learning to read from Hester 's mother was another . Alice , indeed , in her solemn way , was becoming quite fond of Sylvia ; if she could not read or write , she had a deftness and gentleness of motion , a capacity for the household matters which fell into her department , that had a great effect on the old woman , and for her dear mother 's sake Sylvia had a stock of patient love ready in her heart for all the aged and infirm that fell in her way . She never thought of seeking them out , as she knew that Hester did ; but then she looked up to Hester as some one very remarkable for her goodness . If only she could have liked her ! Hester tried to do all she could for Sylvia ; Philip had told her to take care of his wife and child ; but she had the conviction that Sylvia had so materially failed in her duties as to have made her husband an exile from his home -- a penniless wanderer , wifeless and childless , in some strange country , whose very aspect was friendless , while the cause of all lived on in the comfortable home where he had placed her , wanting for nothing -- an object of interest and regard to many friends -- with a lovely little child to give her joy for the present , and hope for the future ; while he , the poor outcast , might even lie dead by the wayside . How could Hester love Sylvia ? Yet they were frequent companions that ensuing spring . Hester was not well ; and the doctors said that the constant occupation in the shop was too much for her , and that she must , for a time at least , take daily walks into the country . Sylvia used to beg to accompany her ; she and the little girl often went with Hester up the valley of the river to some of the nestling farms that were hidden in the more sheltered nooks -- for Hester was bidden to drink milk warm from the cow ; and to go into the familiar haunts about a farm was one of the few things in which Sylvia seemed to take much pleasure . She would let little Bella toddle about while Hester sate and rested : and she herself would beg to milk the cow destined to give the invalid her draught . One May evening the three had been out on some such expedition ; the country side still looked gray and bare , though the leaves were showing on the willow and blackthorn and sloe , and by the tinkling runnels , making hidden music along the copse side , the pale delicate primrose buds were showing amid their fresh , green , crinkled leaves . The larks had been singing all the afternoon , but were now dropping down into their nests in the pasture fields ; the air had just the sharpness in it which goes along with a cloudless evening sky at that time of the year . But Hester walked homewards slowly and languidly , speaking no word . Sylvia noticed this at first without venturing to speak , for Hester was one who disliked having her ailments noticed . But after a while Hester stood still in a sort of weary dreamy abstraction ; and Sylvia said to her , '
196485	196498	196508	196508	she	209	'm afeared yo're sadly tired . Maybe we 've been too far . '
196503	196506	196557	196557	I	0	' No ! '
196510	196552	196557	196557	I	0	' it 's only my headache which is worse to - night . It has been bad all day ; but since I came out it has felt just as if there were great guns booming , till I could almost pray 'em

196567	197070	198665	198666	Sir Sidney	406	' She stepped out quickly towards home after she had said this , as if she wished for neither pity nor comment on what she had said . CHAPTER XXXVIII THE RECOGNITION Far away , over sea and land , over sunny sea again , great guns were booming on that 7th of May , 1799 . The Mediterranean came up with a long roar on a beach glittering white with snowy sand , and the fragments of innumerable sea - shells , delicate and shining as porcelain . Looking at that shore from the sea , a long ridge of upland ground , beginning from an inland depth , stretched far away into the ocean on the right , till it ended in a great mountainous bluff , crowned with the white buildings of a convent sloping rapidly down into the blue water at its base . In the clear eastern air , the different characters of the foliage that clothed the sides of that sea - washed mountain might be discerned from a long distance by the naked eye ; the silver gray of the olive - trees near its summit ; the heavy green and bossy forms of the sycamores lower down ; broken here and there by a solitary terebinth or ilex tree , of a deeper green and a wider spread ; till the eye fell below on the maritime plain , edged with the white seaboard and the sandy hillocks ; with here and there feathery palm - trees , either isolated or in groups -- motionless and distinct against the hot purple air . Look again ; a little to the left on the sea - shore there are the white walls of a fortified town , glittering in sunlight , or black in shadow . The fortifications themselves run out into the sea , forming a port and a haven against the wild Levantine storms ; and a lighthouse rises out of the waves to guide mariners into safety . Beyond this walled city , and far away to the left still , there is the same wide plain shut in by the distant rising ground , till the upland circuit comes closing in to the north , and the great white rocks meet the deep tideless ocean with its intensity of blue colour . Above , the sky is literally purple with heat ; and the pitiless light smites the gazer 's weary eye as it comes back from the white shore . Nor does the plain country in that land offer the refuge and rest of our own soft green . The limestone rock underlies the vegetation , and gives a glittering , ashen hue to all the bare patches , and even to the cultivated parts which are burnt up early in the year . In spring - time alone does the country look rich and fruitful ; then the corn - fields of the plain show their capability of bearing , '
197078	197787	198665	198666	Sir Sidney	406	' ; down by the brook Kishon , flowing not far from the base of the mountainous promontory to the south , there grow the broad green fig - trees , cool and fresh to look upon ; the orchards are full of glossy - leaved cherry - trees ; the tall amaryllis puts forth crimson and yellow glories in the fields , rivalling the pomp of King Solomon ; the daisies and the hyacinths spread their myriad flowers ; the anemones , scarlet as blood , run hither and thither over the ground like dazzling flames of fire . A spicy odour lingers in the heated air ; it comes from the multitude of aromatic flowers that blossom in the early spring . Later on they will have withered and faded , and the corn will have been gathered , and the deep green of the eastern foliage will have assumed a kind of gray - bleached tint . Even now in May , the hot sparkle of the everlasting sea , the terribly clear outline of all objects , whether near or distant , the fierce sun right overhead , the dazzling air around , were inexpressibly wearying to the English eyes that kept their skilled watch , day and night , on the strongly - fortified coast - town that lay out a little to the northward of where the British ships were anchored . They had kept up a flanking fire for many days in aid of those besieged in St Jean d'Acre ; and at intervals had listened , impatient , to the sound of the heavy siege guns , or the sharper rattle of the French musketry . In the morning , on the 7th of May , a man at the masthead of the _ Tigre _ sang out that he saw ships in the offing ; and in reply to the signal that was hastily run up , he saw the distant vessels hoist friendly flags . That May morning was a busy time . The besieged Turks took heart of grace ; the French outside , under the command of their great general , made hasty preparations for a more vigorous assault than all many , both vigorous and bloody , that had gone before ( for the siege was now at its fifty - first day ) , in hopes of carrying the town by storm before the reinforcement coming by sea could arrive ; and Sir Sidney Smith , aware of Buonaparte 's desperate intention , ordered all the men , both sailors and marines , that could be spared from the necessity of keeping up a continual flanking fire from the ships upon the French , to land , and assist the Turks and the British forces already there in the defence of the old historic city . Lieutenant Kinraid , who had shared his captain 's daring adventure off the coast of France three years before , who had been a prisoner with him and Westley Wright , in the Temple at Paris , and had escaped with them , and , through Sir Sidney 's earnest recommendation , been promoted from being a warrant officer to the rank of lieutenant , received on this day the honour from his admiral of being appointed to an especial post of danger . His heart was like a war - horse , and said , Ha , ha ! as the boat bounded over the waves that were to land him under the ancient machicolated walls where the Crusaders made their last stand in the Holy Land . Not that Kinraid knew or cared one jot about those gallant knights of old : all he knew was , that the French , under Boney , were trying to take the town from the Turks , and that his admiral said they must not , and so they should not . He and his men landed on that sandy shore , and entered the town by the water - port gate ; he was singing to himself his own country song,-- Weel may the keel row , the keel row , & amp;C. and his men , with sailors '

After that he was too feverish for several days to collect his senses . When he could first remember , and form a judgment upon his recollections , he called the man especially charged to attend upon him , and bade him go and make inquiry in every possible manner for a marine named Philip Hepburn , and , when he was found , to entreat him to come and see Kinraid . The sailor was away the greater part of the day , and returned unsuccessful in his search ; he had been from ship to ship , hither and thither ; he had questioned all the marines he had met with , no one knew anything of any Philip Hepburn . Kinraid passed a miserably feverish night , and when the doctor exclaimed the next morning at his retrogression , he told him , with some irritation , of the ill - success of his servant ; he accused the man of stupidity , and wished fervently that he were able to go himself . Partly to soothe him , the doctor promised that he would undertake the search for Hepburn , and he engaged faithfully to follow all Kinraid 's eager directions ; not to be satisfied with men 's careless words , but to look over muster - rolls and ships '

He had been about his duty close to some shells that were placed on her deck ; a gay young midshipman was thoughtlessly striving to get the fusee out of one of these by a mallet and spike - nail that lay close at hand ; and a fearful explosion ensued , in which the poor marine , cleaning his bayonet near , was shockingly burnt and disfigured , the very skin of all the lower part of his face being utterly destroyed by gunpowder . They said it was a mercy that his eyes were spared ; but he could hardly feel anything to be a mercy , as he lay tossing in agony , burnt by the explosion , wounded by splinters , and feeling that he was disabled for life , if life itself were preserved . Of all that suffered by that fearful accident ( and they were many ) none was so forsaken , so hopeless , so desolate , as the Philip Hepburn about whom such anxious inquiries were being made at that very time . CHAPTER XXXIX CONFIDENCES It was a little later on in that same summer that Mrs. Brunton came to visit her sister Bessy . Bessy was married to a tolerably well - to - do farmer who lived at an almost equal distance between Monkshaven and Hartswell ; but from old habit and convenience the latter was regarded as the Dawsons '

She thought that Alice Rose must be either mother or aunt to Philip , from the serious cast of countenance that was remarkable in both ; and she rather exulted in the allusion to a happier second marriage for Sylvia , with which she had concluded her speech . It roused Alice , however , as effectually as if she had been really a blood relation to Philip ; but for a different reason . She was not slow to detect the intentional offensiveness to herself in what had been said ; she was indignant at Sylvia for suffering the words spoken to pass unanswered ; but in truth they were too much in keeping with Molly Brunton 's character to make as much impression on Sylvia as they did on a stranger ; and besides , she felt as if the less reply Molly received , the less likely would it be that she would go on in the same strain . So she coaxed and chattered to her child and behaved like a little coward in trying to draw out of the conversation , while at the same time listening attentively . '

So I 'll say naught more about her . But for him as is absent , as thee hast spoken on so lightly and reproachfully , I 'd have thee to know he were one of a different kind to any thee ever knew , I reckon . If he were led away by a pretty face to slight one as was fitter for him , and who had loved him as the apple of her eye , it 's him as is suffering for it , inasmuch as he 's a wanderer from his home , and an outcast from wife and child .

206963	207087	207155	207155	Sylvia	188	' Sylvia was utterly bewildered ; Mrs. Kinraid , this pretty , joyous , prosperous little bird of a woman , Philip , Charley 's wife , what could they have in common ? what could they know of each other ? All she could say in answer to Mrs. Kinraid 's eager questions , and still more eager looks , was , that her husband was from home , had been long from home : she did not know where he was , she did not know when he would come back . Mrs. Kinraid 's face fell a little , partly from her own real disappointment , partly out of sympathy with the hopeless , indifferent tone of Sylvia 's replies . '

And she 'd fain have us believe that Philip is abiding in all manner of Scripture places ; places as has been long done away with , but the similitude whereof is in the heavens , where the elect shall one day see them . And she says Philip is there , and a soldier , and that he saved her husband 's life , and is coming home soon . I wonder what John and Jeremiah 'll say to his soldiering then ? It 'll noane be to their taste , I 'm
209202	209383	209384	209385	Yo'r mother	6965	' This was all very unintelligible to Hester , and she would dearly have liked to question Sylvia ; but Sylvia sate a little apart , with Bella on her knee , her cheek resting on her child 's golden curls , and her eyes fixed and almost trance - like , as if she were seeing things not present . So Hester had to be content with asking her mother as many elucidatory questions as she could ; and after all did not gain a very clear idea of what had really been said by Mrs. Kinraid , as her mother was more full of the apparent injustice of Philip 's being allowed the privilege of treading on holy ground -- if , indeed , that holy ground existed on this side heaven , which she was inclined to dispute -- than to confine herself to the repetition of words , or narration of facts . Suddenly Sylvia roused herself to a sense of Hester 's deep interest and balked inquiries , and she went over the ground rapidly . '

A great square of velvet lawn , intersected diagonally with broad flag - paved walks , the same kind of walk going all round the quadrangle ; low two - storied brick houses , tinted gray and yellow by age , and in many places almost covered with vines , Virginian creepers , and monthly roses ; before each house a little plot of garden ground , bright with flowers , and evidently tended with the utmost care ; on the farther side the massive chapel ; here and there an old or infirm man sunning himself , or leisurely doing a bit of gardening , or talking to one of his comrades -- the place looked as if care and want , and even sorrow , were locked out and excluded by the ponderous gate through which Philip was gazing .

He bent his ear down a very little to hear some whispered suggestion of his daughter 's , nodded his head , and then went on questioning Philip , with kindly inquisitiveness and patronage , as the rich do question the poor .

He forgot his own excuses for having acted as he had done ; though these excuses had at one time seemed to him to wear the garb of reasons . After long thought and bitter memory came some wonder . What was Sylvia doing now ? Where was she ? What was his child like -- his child as well as hers ? And then he remembered the poor footsore wife and the little girl she carried in her arms , that was just the age of Bella ; he wished he had noticed that child more , that a clear vision of it might rise up when he wanted to picture Bella . One night he had gone round this mill - wheel circle of ideas till he was weary to the very marrow of his bones . To shake off the monotonous impression he rose to look for a book amongst the old tattered volumes , hoping that he might find something that would sufficiently lay hold of him to change the current of his thoughts . There was an old volume of _ Peregrine Pickle _ ; a book of sermons ; half an army list of 1774 , and the _ Seven Champions of Christendom _ . Philip took up this last , which he had never seen before . In it he read how Sir Guy , Earl of Warwick , went to fight the Paynim in his own country , and was away for seven long years ; and when he came back his own wife Phillis , the countess in her castle , did not know the poor travel - worn hermit , who came daily to seek his dole of bread at her hands along with many beggars and much poor . But at last , when he lay a - dying in his cave in the rock , he sent for her by a secret sign known but to them twain . And she came with great speed , for she knew it was her lord who had sent for her ; and they had many sweet and holy words together before he gave up the ghost , his head lying on her bosom . The old story known to most people from their childhood was all new and fresh to Philip . He did not quite believe in the truth of it , because the fictitious nature of the histories of some of the other Champions of Christendom was too patent . But he could not help thinking that this one might be true ; and that Guy and Phillis might have been as real flesh and blood , long , long ago , as he and Sylvia had even been . The old room , the quiet moonlit quadrangle into which the cross - barred casement looked , the quaint aspect of everything that he had seen for weeks and weeks ; all this predisposed Philip to dwell upon the story he had just been reading as a faithful legend of two lovers whose bones were long since dust . He thought that if he could thus see Sylvia , himself unknown , unseen -- could live at her gates , so to speak , and gaze upon her and his child -- some day too , when he lay a - dying , he might send for her , and in soft words of mutual forgiveness breathe his life away in her arms . Or perhaps -- and so he lost himself , and from thinking , passed on to dreaming . All night long Guy and Phillis , Sylvia and his child , passed in and out of his visions ; it was impossible to make the fragments of his dreams cohere ; but the impression made upon him by them was not the less strong for this . He felt as if he were called to Monkshaven , wanted at Monkshaven , and to Monkshaven he resolved to go ; although when his reason overtook his feeling , he knew perfectly how unwise it was to leave a home of peace and tranquillity and surrounding friendliness , to go to a place where nothing but want and wretchedness awaited him unless he made himself known ; and if he did , a deeper want , a more woeful wretchedness , would in all probability be his portion . In the small oblong of looking - glass hung against the wall , Philip caught the reflection of his own face , and laughed scornfully at the sight . The thin hair lay upon his temples in the flakes that betoken long ill - health ; his eyes were the same as ever , and they had always been considered the best feature in his face ; but they were sunk in their orbits , and looked hollow and gloomy . As for the lower part of his face , blackened , contracted , drawn away from his teeth , the outline entirely changed by the breakage of his jaw - bone , he was indeed a fool if he thought himself fit to go forth to win back that love which Sylvia had forsworn . As a hermit and a beggar , he must return to Monkshaven , and fall perforce into the same position which Guy of Warwick had only assumed . But still he should see his Phillis , and might feast his sad hopeless eyes from time to time with the sight of his child . His small pension of sixpence a day would keep him from absolute want of necessaries . So that very day he went to the warden and told him he thought of giving up his share in the bequest of Sir Simon Bray . Such a relinquishment had never occurred before in all the warden 's experience ; and he was very much inclined to be offended . '

216534	218393	218631	218631	she	188	' residence there . He was stronger , too , in body , more capable of the day - after - day walks that were required of him . He had saved some money from his allowance as bedesman and from his pension , and might occasionally have taken an outside place on a coach , had it not been that he shrank from the first look of every stranger upon his disfigured face . Yet the gentle , wistful eyes , and the white and faultless teeth always did away with the first impression as soon as people became a little acquainted with his appearance . It was February when Philip left St Sepulchre 's . It was the first week in April when he began to recognize the familiar objects between York and Monkshaven . And now he began to hang back , and to question the wisdom of what he had done -- just as the warden had prophesied that he would . The last night of his two hundred mile walk he slept at the little inn at which he had been enlisted nearly two years before . It was by no intention of his that he rested at that identical place . Night was drawing on ; and , in making , as he thought , a short cut , he had missed his way , and was fain to seek shelter where he might find it . But it brought him very straight face to face with his life at that time , and ever since . His mad , wild hopes -- half the result of intoxication , as he now knew -- all dead and gone ; the career then freshly opening shut up against him now ; his youthful strength and health changed into premature infirmity , and the home and the love that should have opened wide its doors to console him for all , why in two years Death might have been busy , and taken away from him his last feeble chance of the faint happiness of seeing his beloved without being seen or known of her . All that night and all the next day , the fear of Sylvia 's possible death overclouded his heart . It was strange that he had hardly ever thought of this before ; so strange , that now , when the terror came , it took possession of him , and he could almost have sworn that she must be lying dead in Monkshaven churchyard . Or was it little Bella , that blooming , lovely babe , whom he was never to see again ? There was the tolling of mournful bells in the distant air to his disturbed fancy , and the cry of the happy birds , the plaintive bleating of the new - dropped lambs , were all omens of evil import to him . As well as he could , he found his way back to Monkshaven , over the wild heights and moors he had crossed on that black day of misery ; why he should have chosen that path he could not tell -- it was as if he were led , and had no free will of his own . The soft clear evening was drawing on , and his heart beat thick , and then stopped , only to start again with fresh violence . There he was , at the top of the long , steep lane that was in some parts a literal staircase leading down from the hill - top into the High Street , through the very entry up which he had passed when he shrank away from his former and his then present life . There he stood , looking down once more at the numerous irregular roofs , the many stacks of chimneys below him , seeking out that which had once been his own dwelling -- who dwelt there now ? The yellower gleams grew narrower ; the evening shadows broader , and Philip crept down the lane a weary , woeful man . At every gap in the close - packed buildings he heard the merry music of a band , the cheerful sound of excited voices . Still he descended slowly , scarcely wondering what it could be , for it was not associated in his mind with the one pervading thought of Sylvia . When he came to the angle of junction between the lane and the High Street , he seemed plunged all at once into the very centre of the bustle , and he drew himself up into a corner of deep shadow , from whence he could look out upon the street . A circus was making its grand entry into Monkshaven , with all the pomp of colour and of noise that it could muster . Trumpeters in parti - coloured clothes rode first , blaring out triumphant discord . Next came a gold - and - scarlet chariot drawn by six piebald horses , and the windings of this team through the tortuous narrow street were pretty enough to look upon . In the chariot sate kings and queens , heroes and heroines , or what were meant for such ; all the little boys and girls running alongside of the chariot envied them ; but they themselves were very much tired , and shivering with cold in their heroic pomp of classic clothing . All this Philip might have seen ; did see , in fact ; but heeded not one jot . Almost opposite to him , not ten yards apart , standing on the raised step at the well - known shop door , was Sylvia , holding a child , a merry dancing child , up in her arms to see the show . She too , Sylvia , was laughing for pleasure , and for sympathy with pleasure . She held the little Bella aloft that the child might see the gaudy procession the better and the longer , looking at it herself with red lips apart and white teeth glancing through ; then she turned to speak to some one behind her -- Coulson , as Philip saw the moment afterwards ; his answer made her laugh once again . Philip saw it all ; her bonny careless looks , her pretty matronly form , her evident ease of mind and prosperous outward circumstances . The years that he had spent in gloomy sorrow , amongst wild scenes , on land or by sea , his life in frequent peril of a bloody end , had gone by with her like sunny days ; all the more sunny because he was not there . So bitterly thought the poor disabled marine , as , weary and despairing , he stood in the cold shadow and looked upon the home that should have been his haven , the wife that should have welcomed him , the child that should have been his comfort . He had banished himself from his home ; his wife had forsworn him ; his child was blossoming into intelligence unwitting of any father . Wife , and child , and home , were all doing well without him ; what madness had tempted him thither ? an hour ago , like a fanciful fool , he had thought she might be dead -- dead with sad penitence for her cruel words at her heart -- with mournful wonder at the unaccounted - for absence of her child 's father preying on her spirits , and in some measure causing the death he had apprehended . But to look at her there where she stood , it did not seem as if she had had an hour 's painful thought in all her blooming life . Ay ! go in to the warm hearth , mother and child , now the gay cavalcade has gone out of sight , and the chill of night has succeeded to the sun 's setting . Husband and father , steal out into the cold dark street , and seek some poor cheap lodging where you may rest your weary bones , and cheat your more weary heart into forgetfulness in sleep . The pretty story of the Countess Phillis , who mourned for her husband 's absence so long , is a fable of old times ; or rather say Earl Guy never wedded his wife , knowing that one she loved better than him was alive all the time she had believed him to be dead . CHAPTER XLIII THE UNKNOWN A few days before that on which Philip arrived at Monkshaven , Kester had come to pay Sylvia a visit . As the earliest friend she had , and also as one who knew the real secrets of her life , Sylvia always gave him the warm welcome , the cordial words , and the sweet looks in which the old man delighted . He had a sort of delicacy of his own which kept him from going to see her too often , even when he was stationary at Monkshaven ; but he looked forward to the times when he allowed himself this pleasure as a child at school looks forward to its holidays . The time of his service at Haytersbank had , on the whole , been the happiest in all his long monotonous years of daily labour . Sylvia 's father had always treated him with the rough kindness of fellowship ; Sylvia 's mother had never stinted him in his meat or grudged him his share of the best that was going ; and once , when he was ill for a few days in the loft above the cow - house , she had made him possets , and nursed him with the same tenderness which he remembered his mother showing to him when he was a little child , but which he had never experienced since then . He had known Sylvia herself , as bud , and sweet promise of blossom ; and just as she was opening into the full - blown rose , and , if she had been happy and prosperous , might have passed out of the narrow circle of Kester 's interests , one sorrow after another came down upon her pretty innocent head , and Kester 's period of service to Daniel Robson , her father , was tragically cut short . All this made Sylvia the great centre of the faithful herdsman 's affection ; and Bella , who reminded him of what Sylvia was when first Kester knew her , only occupied the second place in his heart , although to the child he was much more demonstrative of his regard than to the mother . He had dressed himself in his Sunday best , and although it was only Thursday , had forestalled his Saturday 's shaving ; he had provided himself with a paper of humbugs for the child--'humbugs '

But Sylvia 's habits were changed since she , as a girl at Haytersbank , liked to spend half her time in the open air , running out perpetually without anything on to scatter crumbs to the poultry , or to take a piece of bread to the old cart - horse , to go up to the garden for a handful of herbs , or to clamber to the highest point around to blow the horn which summoned her father and Kester home to dinner . Living in a town where it was necessary to put on hat and cloak before going out into the street , and then to walk in a steady and decorous fashion , she had only cared to escape down to the freedom of the sea - shore until Philip went away ; and after that time she had learnt so to fear observation as a deserted wife , that nothing but Bella 's health would have been a sufficient motive to take her out of doors . And , as she had told Kester , the necessity of giving the little girl a daily walk was very much lightened by the great love and affection which Jeremiah Foster now bore to the child . Ever since the day when the baby had come to his knee , allured by the temptation of his watch , he had apparently considered her as in some sort belonging to him ; and now he had almost come to think that he had a right to claim her as his companion in his walk back from the Bank to his early dinner , where a high chair was always placed ready for the chance of her coming to share his meal . On these occasions he generally brought her back to the shop - door when he returned to his afternoon 's work at the Bank . Sometimes , however , he would leave word that she was to be sent for from his house in the New Town , as his business at the Bank for that day was ended . Then Sylvia was compelled to put on her things , and fetch back her darling ; and excepting for this errand she seldom went out at all on week - days . About a fortnight after Kester 's farewell call , this need for her visit to Jeremiah Foster 's arose ; and it seemed to Sylvia that there could not be a better opportunity of fulfilling her promise and going to see the widow Dobson , whose cottage was on the other side of the river , low down on the cliff - side , just at the bend and rush of the full stream into the open sea . She set off pretty early in order to go there first . She found the widow with her house - place tidied up after the midday meal , and busy knitting at the open door -- not looking at her rapid - clicking needles , but gazing at the rush and recession of the waves before her ; yet not seeing them either,--rather seeing days long past . She started into active civility as soon as she recognized Sylvia , who was to her as a great lady , never having known Sylvia Robson in her wild childish days . Widow Dobson was always a little scandalized at her brother Christopher 's familiarity with Mrs. Hepburn . She dusted a chair which needed no dusting , and placed it for Sylvia , sitting down herself on a three - legged stool to mark her sense of the difference in their conditions , for there was another chair or two in the humble dwelling ; and then the two fell into talk -- first about Kester , whom his sister would persist in calling Christopher , as if his dignity as her elder brother was compromised by any familiar abbreviation ; and by - and - by she opened her heart a little more .

221635	221667	221668	221668	He	222	' , which Sylvia had observed on drawing near the cottage , and the recollection of the mention of which by Kester had enabled her to identify widow Dobson 's dwelling . '

She did not know that she had been so near to him towards whom her heart was softening , day by day . CHAPTER XLIV FIRST WORDS It was the spring of 1800 . Old people yet can tell of the hard famine of that year . The harvest of the autumn before had failed ; the war and the corn laws had brought the price of corn up to a famine rate ; and much of what came into the market was unsound , and consequently unfit for food , yet hungry creatures bought it eagerly , and tried to cheat disease by mixing the damp , sweet , clammy flour with rice or potato meal . Rich families denied themselves pastry and all unnecessary and luxurious uses of wheat in any shape ; the duty on hair - powder was increased ; and all these palliatives were but as drops in the ocean of the great want of the people . Philip , in spite of himself , recovered and grew stronger ; and as he grew stronger hunger took the place of loathing dislike to food . But his money was all spent ; and what was his poor pension of sixpence a day in that terrible year of famine ? Many a summer 's night he walked for hours and hours round the house which once was his , which might be his now , with all its homely , blessed comforts , could he but go and assert his right to it . But to go with authority , and in his poor , maimed guise assert that right , he had need be other than Philip Hepburn . So he stood in the old shelter of the steep , crooked lane opening on to the hill out of the market - place , and watched the soft fading of the summer 's eve into night ; the closing of the once familiar shop ; the exit of good , comfortable William Coulson , going to his own home , his own wife , his comfortable , plentiful supper . Then Philip -- there were no police in those days , and scarcely an old watchman in that primitive little town -- would go round on the shady sides of streets , and , quickly glancing about him , cross the bridge , looking on the quiet , rippling stream , the gray shimmer foretelling the coming dawn over the sea , the black masts and rigging of the still vessels against the sky ; he could see with his wistful , eager eyes the shape of the windows -- the window of the very room in which his wife and child slept , unheeding of him , the hungry , broken - hearted outcast . He would go back to his lodging , and softly lift the latch of the door ; still more softly , but never without an unspoken , grateful prayer , pass by the poor sleeping woman who had given him a shelter and her share of God 's blessing -- she who , like him , knew not the feeling of satisfied hunger ; and then he laid him down on the narrow pallet in the lean - to , and again gave Sylvia happy lessons in the kitchen at Haytersbank , and the dead were alive ; and Charley Kinraid , the specksioneer , had never come to trouble the hopeful , gentle peace . For widow Dobson had never taken Sylvia 's advice . The tramp known to her by the name of Freeman -- that in which he received his pension -- lodged with her still , and paid his meagre shilling in advance , weekly . A shilling was meagre in those hard days of scarcity . A hungry man might easily eat the produce of a shilling in a day . Widow Dobson pleaded this to Sylvia as an excuse for keeping her lodger on ; to a more calculating head it might have seemed a reason for sending him away . '

226173	226429	227062	227062	he	5340	' So Hester went away , her heart beating with the promise of knowing something about Philip,--how much , how little , in these first moments , she dared not say even to herself . Some sailor newly landed from distant seas might have become possessed of Philip 's watch in far - off latitudes ; in which case , Philip would be dead . That might be . She tried to think that this was the most probable way of accounting for the watch . She could be certain as to the positive identity of the watch -- being in William Darley 's possession . Again , it might be that Philip himself was near at hand -- was here in this very place -- starving , as too many were , for insufficiency of means to buy the high - priced food . And then her heart burnt within her as she thought of the succulent , comfortable meals which Sylvia provided every day -- nay , three times a day -- for the household in the market - place , at the head of which Philip ought to have been ; but his place knew him not . For Sylvia had inherited her mother 's talent for housekeeping , and on her , in Alice 's decrepitude and Hester 's other occupations in the shop , devolved the cares of due provision for the somewhat heterogeneous family . And Sylvia ! Hester groaned in heart over the remembrance of Sylvia 's words , '
226442	226591	227107	227107	he	5340	' that night when Hester had come , and clung to her , making the sad , shameful confession of her unreturned love . What could ever bring these two together again ? Could Hester herself -- ignorant of the strange mystery of Sylvia 's heart , as those who are guided solely by obedience to principle must ever be of the clue to the actions of those who are led by the passionate ebb and flow of impulse ? Could Hester herself ? Oh ! how should she speak , how should she act , if Philip were near -- if Philip were sad and in miserable estate ? Her own misery at this contemplation of the case was too great to bear ; and she sought her usual refuge in the thought of some text , some promise of Scripture , which should strengthen her faith . '
226599	227060	227527	227527	he	222	' said she , repeating the words as though to lull her anxiety to rest . Yes ; with God all things are possible . But ofttimes He does his work with awful instruments . There is a peacemaker whose name is Death . CHAPTER XLV SAVED AND LOST Hester went out on the evening of the day after that on which the unknown owner of the half - crown had appointed to call for it again at William Darley 's . She had schooled herself to believe that time and patience would serve her best . Her plan was to obtain all the knowledge about Philip that she could in the first instance ; and then , if circumstances allowed it , as in all probability they would , to let drop by drop of healing , peacemaking words and thoughts fall on Sylvia 's obdurate , unforgiving heart . So Hester put on her things , and went out down towards the old quay - side on that evening after the shop was closed . Poor little Sylvia ! She was unforgiving , but not obdurate to the full extent of what Hester believed . Many a time since Philip went away had she unconsciously missed his protecting love ; when folks spoke shortly to her , when Alice scolded her as one of the non - elect , when Hester 's gentle gravity had something of severity in it ; when her own heart failed her as to whether her mother would have judged that she had done well , could that mother have known all , as possibly she did by this time . Philip had never spoken otherwise than tenderly to her during the eighteen months of their married life , except on the two occasions before recorded : once when she referred to her dream of Kinraid 's possible return , and once again on the evening of the day before her discovery of his concealment of the secret of Kinraid 's involuntary disappearance . After she had learnt that Kinraid was married , her heart had still more strongly turned to Philip ; she thought that he had judged rightly in what he had given as the excuse for his double dealing ; she was even more indignant at Kinraid 's fickleness than she had any reason to be ; and she began to learn the value of such enduring love as Philip 's had been -- lasting ever since the days when she first began to fancy what a man 's love for a woman should be , when she had first shrunk from the tone of tenderness he put into his especial term for her , a girl of twelve--'Little lassie , '

228982	229230	229443	229443	she	188	' she said again . She stood by the door , shivering all over , almost facing the people in the road , but with her face turned a little to the right , so that they thought she was looking at the pathway on the cliff - side , a hundred yards or so distant , below which the hungry waves still lashed themselves into high ascending spray ; while nearer to the cottage , where their force was broken by the bar at the entrance to the river , they came softly lapping up the shelving shore . Sylvia saw nothing of all this , though it was straight before her eyes . She only saw a blurred mist ; she heard no sound of waters , though it filled the ears of those around . Instead she heard low whispers pronouncing Philip 's earthly doom . For the doctors were both agreed ; his internal injury was of a mortal kind , although , as the spine was severely injured above the seat of the fatal bruise , he had no pain in the lower half of his body . They had spoken in so low a tone that John Foster , standing only a foot or so away , had not been able to hear their words . But Sylvia heard each syllable there where she stood outside , shivering all over in the sultry summer evening . She turned round to Kester . '

But noiseless as her step might be , he heard , he recognized , and with a sigh he turned his poor disfigured face to the wall , hiding it in the shadow . He knew that she was by him ; that she had knelt down by his bed ; that she was kissing his hand , over which the languor of approaching death was stealing . But no one spoke . At length he said , his face still averted , speaking with an effort . '
229594	229627	229686	229686	He	0	' There was no answer , only a long miserable sigh , and he felt her soft cheek laid upon his hand , and the quiver that ran through her whole body . '
