781	786	778	778	himself	174	“ believe in the war ”
1377	1391	1392	1392	he	174	“ Well — I suppose that ’s the stuff pictures are made of , ”
1652	1664	1639	1639	he	174	“ Let ’s see what you ’ve done to Daisy Dolmetsch . ”
1665	1678	1679	1679	Campton	174	“ Oh , it ’s been done for me — you’ll see ! ”
1768	1780	1781	1781	Campton	174	“ But she ’s magnificent . She ’s seen the Medusa ! ”
1785	1814	1781	1781	Campton	174	“ Just so . For days and days I ’d been trying to do something with her ; and suddenly the war - funk did it for me . ”
1815	1821	1781	1781	Campton	174	“ The war - funk ? ”
1822	1860	1781	1781	Campton	174	“ Who ’d have thought it ? She ’s frightened to death about Ladislas Isador — who is French , it turns out , and mobilisable . The poor soul thinks there ’s going to be war ! ”
1861	1869	1871	1871	Dastrey	188	“ Well , there _ is _ , ”
1914	1946	1781	1781	Campton	174	“ Oh , come — you too ? Why , the Duke of Alicante has just left here , fresh from Berlin . You ought to hear him laugh at us .... ”
1947	1958	1959	1959	Dastrey	188	“ How about Berlin ’s laughing at _ him _ ? ”
1982	2005	2006	2006	he	174	“ There ca n’t be war : I ’m going to Sicily and Africa with George the day after to - morrow , ”
2010	2018	2006	2006	he	174	“ Ah , George——. To be sure .... ”
2040	2061	2062	2062	he	188	“ Too young for ’ seventy — and too old for this ! Some men are born under a curse , ”
2066	2075	2062	2062	he	188	“ What on earth are you talking about ? ”
2093	2131	2085	2085	Dastrey	188	“ But I shall get something , somewhere ... they ca n’t stop a man ’s enlisting ... I had an old uncle who did it in ’ seventy ... he was older than I am now . ”
2229	2233	2234	2234	he	174	“ Look here , ”
2237	2282	2234	2234	he	174	“ I ’ll tell you what . Come along with George and me — as far as Palermo , anyhow . You ’re a little stiff again in that left knee , and we can bake our lamenesses together in the good Sicilian oven . ”
2293	2305	2283	2283	Dastrey	188	“ My poor Campton — there’ll be war in three days . ”
2517	2528	2529	2529	he	174	“ And with what I ’ve had to fight against ! ”
2594	2629	2580	2580	He	174	“ There wo n’t be war . But if there were — why should n’t George and I go to Sicily ? You do n’t see us sitting here making lint , do you ? ”
2633	2665	2666	2666	He	174	“ Lint is unhygienic ; you wo n’t have to do that . And I see no reason why _ you _ should n’t go to Sicily — or to China . ”
2669	2686	2666	2666	He	174	“ But how about George — I thought he and you were both born in France ? ”
2693	2748	2687	2687	Campton	174	“ We were , worse luck . He ’s subject to your preposterous military regulations . But it does n’t make any difference , as it happens . He ’s sure to be discharged after that touch of tuberculosis he had last year , when he had to be rushed up to the Engadine . ”
2749	2775	2831	2831	he	174	“ Ah , I see . Then , as you say .... Still , of course he would n’t be allowed to leave the country . ”
2823	2830	2831	2831	he	174	“ Of course , you know , ”
2840	2882	2831	2831	he	174	“ I still consider this discussion purely academic .... But if it turns out that I ’m wrong I shall do all I can — all I can , do you hear?—to get George discharged .... You ’d better know that .... ”
2896	2912	2913	2913	He	188	“ My dear old Campton , I perfectly understand a foreigner ’s taking that view .... ”
3079	3091	3077	3077	himself	174	“ I ’ll come and wind things up to - morrow . ”
3241	3265	3216	3216	He	174	“ Very anxious . Must see you to - morrow . Please come to Avenue Marigny at five without fail . Julia Brant . ”
3266	3271	3272	3272	Campton	174	“ Oh , damn , ”
3290	3297	3298	3298	she	480	“ Is it war , sir ? ”
3318	3327	3328	3328	He	174	“ No — no — nonsense ! War ? ”
3348	3382	3328	3328	He	174	“ War ? Can you imagine anything more absurd ? Can you , now ? What should you say if they told you war was going to be declared , Mme . Lebel ? ”
3403	3436	3394	3394	she	480	“ Why , I should say we do n’t want it , sir — I’d have four in it if it came—_but that this sort of thing has got to stop _ . ”
3440	3478	3394	3394	she	480	“ Oh , well — it ’s not going to come , so do n’t worry . And call me a taxi , will you ? No , no , I ’ll carry the bags down myself . ”
3480	3495	3496	3498	Mrs. Anderson Brant	196	“ But even if they do mobilise : mobilisation is not war—_is _ it ? ”
3658	3669	3670	3670	he	174	“ You ’ve taken away Beausite ’s portrait of you , ”
3741	3757	3758	3758	she	196	“ Yes . Anderson thought ... the dress had grown so dreadfully old - fashioned , ”
3767	3781	3758	3758	she	196	“ You think it ’s _ not _ war : do n’t you ? ”
3840	3853	3854	3854	he	174	“ It _ is _ war , this time , I believe , ”
3871	3878	3879	3879	she	196	“ I disagree with you entirely , ”
3888	3955	3879	3879	she	196	“ I was frightfully upset when I sent you that telegram yesterday ; but I ’ve been lunching to - day with the old Duc de Montlhéry — you know he fought in ’ seventy — and with Lévi - Michel of the ‘ Jour , ’ who had just seen some of the government people ; and they both explained to me quite clearly — — ”
3956	3969	3972	3972	himself	498	“ That you ’d made a mistake in coming up from Deauville ? ”
4061	4100	4046	4046	he	498	“ You see , the situation is rather different from anything we ’ve known before ; and , after all , in 1870 all the wise people thought till the last minute that there would be no war . ”
4112	4119	4120	4120	she	501	“ Then — what about George ? ”
4137	4149	4132	4132	Campton	174	“ You may suppose I ’ve thought of _ that _ . ”
4150	4156	4159	4159	she	501	“ Oh , of course .... ”
4220	4232	4233	4233	he	174	“ I see nothing to worry about with regard to George , ”
4236	4242	4233	4233	he	174	“ You mean — — ? ”
4243	4263	4290	4290	her	501	“ Why , they wo n’t take him — they wo n’t want him ... with his medical record . ”
4264	4281	4290	4290	her	501	“ Are you sure ? He ’s so much stronger .... He ’s gained twenty pounds .... ”
4402	4416	4417	4417	Campton	174	“ After all , we ’re Americans ; this is not our job — ”
4420	4423	4417	4417	Campton	174	“ No — ”
4435	4472	4424	4424	He	174	“ So of course — if there were any trouble — but there wo n’t be ; if there were , though , I should n’t hesitate to do what was necessary ... use any influence .... ”
4473	4480	4483	4483	her	501	“ Oh , then we agree ! ”
4518	4528	4514	4514	Dastrey	188	“ I perfectly understand a foreigner ’s taking that view ”
4647	4679	4639	4640	Mrs. Brant	196	“ Of course you know how careful I always am to do nothing about him without consulting you ; but since you feel about it as _ we _ do — — ”
4688	4690	4639	4640	Mrs. Brant	196	“ we ”
4807	4811	4805	4805	her	519	“ I think , ”
4813	4817	4805	4805	her	519	“ Anderson thinks , ”
4824	4831	4805	4805	her	519	“ _ we _ think it . ”
4863	4865	4805	4805	her	519	“ Anderson ”
4945	4949	4950	4950	he	174	“ Look here , ”
4954	5029	5030	5030	She	196	“ there are things I ’ve had to accept in the past , and shall have to accept in the future . The boy is to go into Bullard and Brant’s — it ’s agreed ; I ’m not sure enough of being able to provide for him for the next few years to interfere with — with your plans in that respect . But I thought it was understood once for all — — ”
5035	5054	5055	5055	He	174	“ Oh , of course ... of course . You must admit I ’ve always respected your feeling .... ”
5059	5062	5055	5055	He	174	“ Yes . ”
5063	5098	5117	5117	Anderson	196	“ Well , then — won’t you see that this situation is different , terribly different , and that we ought all to work together ? If Anderson ’s influence can be of use .... ”
5099	5105	5106	5106	Campton	174	“ Anderson ’s influence — — ”
5154	5158	5159	5159	he	174	“ Of course , ”
5163	5180	5159	5159	he	174	“ But , as it happens , I think I can attend to this job myself . ”
5200	5217	5224	5224	she	196	“ What makes you think so ? You do n’t know the right sort of people . ”
5269	5275	5265	5265	he	174	“ the right sort of people ”
5317	5323	5324	5324	she	196	“ Anderson , you see , ”
5339	5385	5324	5324	she	196	“ Anderson knows all the political people . In a business way , of course , a big banker has to . If there ’s really any chance of George ’s being taken you ’ve no right to refuse Anderson ’s help — none whatever ! ”
5436	5452	5453	5453	he	174	“ But if you ’re so sure there ’s not going to be war — — ”
5572	5590	5555	5555	He	174	“ I understood you were coming , and hurried back ... on the chance ... to consult .... ”
5919	5922	5923	5923	Campton	174	“ Coronas . ”
5943	5956	5957	5957	Campton	174	“ I ought to have taken one — I may need him , ”
5969	5980	5961	5962	Mrs. Brant	196	“ He thinks as _ we _ do — exactly . ”
6050	6065	6066	6066	he	197	“ Poor devil — he’d give all his millions if the boy were safe , ”
6069	6080	6066	6066	he	197	“ and he does n’t even dare to say so . ”
6112	6128	6129	6129	he	174	“ There ’s nothing to be done at present ... absolutely nothing — — Except , ”
6133	6146	6129	6129	he	174	“ to take care not to talk in this way to George . ”
6154	6178	6147	6148	Mrs. Brant	196	“ What do you mean ? If war is declared , you ca n’t expect me not to speak of it to him . ”
6179	6206	6207	6207	He	174	“ Speak of it as much as you like , but do n’t drag him in . Let him work out his own case for himself . ”
6214	6223	6207	6207	He	174	“ It ’s what I intend to do . ”
6224	6234	6235	6235	she	196	“ But you said you ’d use every influence ! ”
6240	6251	6235	6235	she	196	“ Well — I believe this is one of them . ”
6268	6285	6286	6286	he	174	“ My telling her that has been just enough to start her on the other tack , ”
6318	6324	6325	6325	he	174	“ Mr. Campton is right , ”
6332	6355	6325	6325	he	174	“ I take the same view — entirely . George must not know that we are thinking of using ... any means .... ”
6495	6500	6483	6483	Campton	174	“ We men know ... ”
6799	6807	6808	6808	George	175	“ How jolly the old place smells ! ”
6849	6862	6839	6839	his	175	“ Well , this time I suppose we ’re in for it . ”
6912	6918	6919	6919	he	2492	“ Madrid , is it ? ”
7395	7400	7385	7385	He	416	“ Oh , Dad ... ”
7430	7439	7440	7440	George	175	“ Where the deuce did you get that ? ”
7448	7503	7440	7440	George	175	“ Did n’t you know ? Mr. Brant has started collecting first editions . There ’s a chap who comes over from London with things for him . He lets me have them to look at when I ’m seedy . I say , is n’t this topping ? Do you remember the fight ? ”
7536	7546	7547	7548	the father	568	“ I could n’t have done that for him , ”
8236	8246	8247	8247	Campton	174	“ Dastrey does n’t think it can be stopped , ”
8256	8312	8247	8247	Campton	174	“ Dear old Dastrey ! No , I suppose not . That after - Sedan generation have got the inevitability of war in their bones . They ’ve never been able to get beyond it . _ Our _ whole view is different : we ’re internationals , whether we want to be or not . ”
8313	8343	8344	8345	his father	580	“ To begin with , if by ‘ our ’ view you mean yours and mine , you and I have n’t a drop of French blood in us , ”
8348	8363	8344	8345	his father	580	“ and we can never really know what the French feel on such matters . ”
8370	8554	8364	8364	George	175	“ Oh , but I didn’t — I meant ‘ we ’ in the sense of my generation , of whatever nationality . I know French chaps who feel as I do — Louis Dastrey , Paul ’s nephew , for one ; and lots of English ones . They do n’t believe the world will ever stand for another war . It ’s too stupidly uneconomic , to begin with : I suppose you ’ve read Angell ? Then life ’s worth too much , and nowadays too many millions of people know it . That ’s the way we all feel . Think of everything that counts — art and science and poetry , and all the rest — going to smash at the nod of some doddering diplomatist ! It was different in old times , when the best of life , for the immense majority , was never anything but plague , pestilence and famine . People are too healthy and well - fed now ; they ’re not going off to die in a ditch to oblige anybody . ”
8627	8633	8634	8635	the father	568	“ Suppose war does come , ”
8638	8655	8634	8635	the father	568	“ what if I were to go over and tell him I ’ll paint his dancer ? ”
8778	8783	8785	8785	he	176	“ War — war , ”
8840	8860	8835	8835	she	626	“ If I can make time for a sketch — will you bring your dancing lady to - morrow ? ”
8872	8889	8890	8890	He	415	“ My dear friend — will I ? She ’s simply set her heart on it ! ”
8898	8953	8890	8890	He	415	“ But why not tell her the good news yourself ? You told me , I think , you ’d never seen her ? This is her last night at the ‘ Posada , ’ and if you ’ll jump into my motor we shall be just in time to see her come on . ”
9038	9041	8988	8989	The physician	415	“ Posada . ”
9150	9153	9109	9109	others	644	“ Posada , ”
9383	9395	9396	9396	he	174	“ Well , I ’ll do her , if you like , ”
9414	9448	9396	9396	he	174	“ To - morrow , then — at two — may I bring her ? She leaves as soon as possible for the south . She lives on sun , heat , radiance .... ”
9449	9456	9457	9457	Campton	174	“ To - morrow — yes , ”
9500	9516	9496	9497	the boy	416	“ Did I hear you tell old Fortin you were going to do his dancer ? ”
9517	9528	9530	9530	Campton	174	“ Yes — why not ? She ’s very paintable , ”
9539	9545	9530	9530	Campton	174	“ Beginning to - morrow ? ”
9546	9550	9496	9497	the boy	416	“ Why not ? ”
9551	9560	9561	9561	George	175	“ Come , you know—_to - morrow _ ! ”
9564	9569	9561	9561	George	175	“ We ’ll see , ”
9668	9693	9694	9694	Campton	174	“ My dear Campton — the very man I ’ve been hunting for ! You remember me — your cousin Harvey Mayhew of Utica ? ”
9717	9738	9694	9694	Campton	174	“ Oh , the simplest thing in the world . You see , I ’m here as a Delegate — — ”
9753	9856	9746	9747	Mr. Mayhew	212	“ To the Peace Congress at The Hague —— why , yes : naturally . I landed only this morning , and find myself in the middle of all this rather foolish excitement , and unable to make out just how I can reach my destination . My time is — er — valuable , and it is very unfortunate that all this commotion should be allowed to interfere with our work . It would be most annoying if , after having made the effort to break away from Utica , I should arrive too late for the opening of the Congress . ”
9863	9870	9857	9857	Campton	174	“ Then you ’re going anyhow ? ”
9871	9885	9886	9887	Mr. Mayhew	212	“ Going ? Why not ? You surely do n’t think — — ? ”
9897	9949	9890	9890	his	212	“ I should n’t , in any case , allow anything so opposed to my convictions as _ war _ to interfere with my carrying out my mandate . All I want is to find out the route least likely to be closed if — if this monstrous thing should happen . ”
9953	9983	9984	9984	He	174	“ Well , if I were you , I should go round by Luxembourg — it ’s longer , but you ’ll be out of the way of trouble . ”
10066	10081	10049	10049	George	175	“ Oh , do n’t go to bed yet — it ’s too jolly . ”
10172	10185	10169	10169	Campton	174	“ Are you game to start the day after to - morrow ? ”
10191	10195	10169	10169	Campton	174	“ For Africa ? ”
10196	10240	10241	10241	George	175	“ Well — my idea would be to push straight through to the south — as far as Palermo , say . All this cloudy watery loveliness gives me a furious appetite for violent red earth and white houses crackling in the glare . ”
10249	10280	10246	10246	he	175	“ It sounds first - rate . But if you ’re so sure we ’re going to start why did you tell Fortin to bring that girl to - morrow ? ”
10318	10328	10329	10329	he	175	“ It was stupid — I’ll put her off , ”
10473	10485	10469	10469	George	175	“ All the same , I think I ’ll turn in , ”
11282	11284	11280	11285	a worthless “ artistic ” brother	727	“ artistic ”
11378	11415	11416	11416	she	221	“ Somehow , behind it all , I was right , and they were wrong ; but to do anything with poor Bill I ought to have been able to begin two or three generations back , ”
11525	11535	11536	11536	Adele	220	“ Well — you’d better not , any longer , ”
11715	11731	11700	11700	Julia	214	“ We ’d have to live in Utica — for some years at any rate ? ”
11732	11741	11742	11742	They	740	“ Well , yes , no doubt — — ”
11748	11783	11784	11784	she	214	“ They ’d much better look out for another manager . What do you know about business ? Since you ’ve taken up painting you ’d better try to make a success of that , ”

11974	11993	11994	11994	she	214	“ It ’s a great mistake to try to be original till people have got used to you , ”
12005	12035	11994	11994	she	214	“ If you ’d only been civil to Beausite he would have ended by taking you up , and then you could have painted as queerly as you liked . ”
12135	12148	12149	12149	he	174	“ If you ’d only understand that that ’s not the way , ”
12152	12158	12149	12149	he	174	“ What is , then ? ”
12159	12174	12205	12205	She	214	“ Why , letting all that lot see what unutterable rubbish one thinks them ! ”
12175	12187	12188	12188	she	214	“ I should have thought you ’d tried that long enough , ”
12442	12446	12411	12411	she	214	“ early Campton , ”
12858	12890	12852	12852	he	174	“ There ’s a little place up the line that I want to go back and paint . You do n’t mind staying here a day or two , do you ? ”
13010	13034	13035	13036	Adele Anthony	220	“ What did you do it for — I mean in that particular way ? For goodness knows I understand all the rest , ”
13124	13132	13133	13133	she	781	“ _ Comme je vous comprends ! _ ”

13972	14010	14011	14011	He	175	“ In case of general mobilisation announced to the populations of France by public proclamations , or by notices posted in the streets , the bearer of this order is to rejoin his regiment at — — . “
14022	14056	14011	14011	He	175	“ He is to present himself at the station of — — on the third day of mobilisation at 6 o’clock , and to take the train indicated by the station - master . “
14084	14097	14011	14011	He	175	” Campton dropped the book and pressed his hands to his temples . “
14125	14227	14228	14229	The bearer	817	” Then , if France mobilised that day , George would start the second day after , at six in the morning . George might be going to leave him within forty - eight hours from that very moment ! Campton had always vaguely supposed that , some day or other , if war came , a telegram would call George to his base ; it had never occurred to him that every detail of the boy ’s military life had long since been regulated by the dread power which had him in its grasp . He read the next paragraph : “
14237	14496	14228	14229	The bearer	817	” and thought with a grin how it would annoy Anderson Brant that the French government should presume to treat his stepson as if he could not pay his way . The plump bundle of bank - notes on the dressing - table seemed to look with ineffectual scorn at the red book that sojourned so democratically in the same pocket . And Campton , picturing George jammed into an overcrowded military train , on the plebeian wooden seat of a third - class compartment , grinned again , forgetful of his own anxiety in the vision of Brant ’s exasperation . Ah , well , it was n’t war yet , whatever they said ! He carried the red book back to the dressing - table . The light falling across the bed drew his eye to the young face on the pillow . George lay on his side , one arm above his head , the other laxly stretched along the bed . He had thrown off the blankets , and the sheet , clinging to his body , modelled his slim flank and legs as he lay in dreamless rest . For a long time Campton stood gazing ; then he stole back to the sitting - room , picked up a sketch - book and pencil and returned . He knew there was no danger of waking George , and he began to draw , eagerly but deliberately , fascinated by the happy accident of the lighting , and of the boy ’s position . “
14509	14547	14228	14229	The bearer	817	” he said to himself , vexed and surprised that he , whose plastic memories were always so precise , should not remember where ; and then his pencil stopped . What he had really thought was : “
14556	14815	14816	14816	I	0	knight”—though he had instinctively changed the word as it formed itself . He leaned in the doorway , the sketch - book in hand , and continued to gaze at his son . It was the clinging sheet , no doubt , that gave him that look ... and the white glare of the electric burner . If war came , that was just the way a boy might lie on a battle - field - or afterward in a hospital bed . Not _ his _ boy , thank heaven ; but very probably his boy ’s friends : hundreds and thousands of boys like his boy , the age of his boy , with a laugh like his boy ’s .... The wicked waste of it ! Well , that was what war meant ... what to - morrow might bring to millions of parents like himself . He stiffened his shoulders , and opened the sketch - book again . What watery stuff was he made of , he wondered ? Just because the boy lay as if he were posing for a tombstone ! ... What of Signorelli , who had sat at his dead son ’s side and drawn him , tenderly , minutely , while the coffin waited ? Well , damn Signorelli — that was all ! Campton threw down his book , turned out the sitting - room lights , and limped away to bed . V The next morning he said to George , over coffee on the terrace : “
14829	14838	14818	14818	I	0	” George nodded , munching his golden roll . “
14851	14864	14847	14847	mother	821	” His father was silent . Inwardly he was saying to himself : “
14878	14998	14999	14999	You	822	” There had not been much to gather from the newspapers heaped at their feet . Austria had ordered general mobilisation ; but while the tone of the despatches was nervous and contradictory that of the leading articles remained almost ominously reassuring . Campton absorbed the reassurance without heeding its quality : it was a drug he had to have at any price . He expected the Javanese dancer to sit to him that afternoon , but he had not proposed to George to be present . On the chance that things might eventually take a wrong turn he meant to say a word to Fortin - Lescluze ; and the presence of his son would have been embarrassing . “
15006	15021	14999	14999	You	822	” he called to George , who still lounged on the terrace in pyjamas . “
15037	15038	15026	15026	mother	821	” “
15044	15051	15026	15026	mother	821	” said Campton with grim cordiality . “
15069	15101	15052	15052	You	822	” It was the grotesque name that George , in his babyhood , had given to Mr. Brant , and when he grew up it had been difficult to substitute another . “
15106	15118	15052	15052	You	822	” George added , pulling himself up out of his chair . “
15121	15144	15052	15052	You	822	” They looked at each other in silence , irritation in the father ’s eye , indulgent amusement in the son ’s . “
15160	15161	15148	15148	you	822	” “
15167	15173	15148	15148	you	822	” agreed Campton , relieved . “
15192	15201	15182	15182	I	0	” He paused on the threshold to add : “
15211	15212	15209	15209	Adele	220	” “
15218	15223	15209	15209	Adele	220	” his son responded . “
15235	15414	15209	15209	Adele	220	” As he left the room he heard George rapping on the telephone and calling out Miss Anthony ’s number . Campton had to have reassurance at any price ; and he got it , as usual , irrationally but irresistibly , through his eyes . The mere fact that the midsummer sun lay so tenderly on Paris , that the bronze dolphins of the fountains in the square were spraying the Nereids ’ Louis Philippe chignons as playfully as ever ; that the sleepy Cities of France dozed as heavily on their thrones , and the Horses of Marly pranced as fractiously on their pedestals ; that the glorious central setting of the city lay there in its usual mellow pomp — all this gave him a sense of security that no crisscrossing of Reuters and Havases could shake . Nevertheless , he reflected that there was no use in battling with the silly hysterical crowd he would be sure to encounter at Cook ’s ; and having left word with the hotel - porter to secure two “
15416	15713	15209	15209	Adele	220	” on the Naples express , he drove to the studio . On the way , as his habit was , he thought hard of his model : everything else disappeared like a rolled - up curtain , and his inner vision centred itself on the little yellow face he was to paint . Peering through her cobwebby window , he saw old Mme . Lebel on the watch . He knew she wanted to pounce out and ask if there would be war ; and composing his most taciturn countenance he gave her a preoccupied nod and hurried by . The studio looked grimy and disordered , and he remembered that he had intended , the evening before , to come back and set it to rights . In pursuance of this plan , he got out a canvas , fussed with his brushes and colours , and then tried once more to make the place tidy . But his attempts at order always resulted in worse confusion ; the fact had been one of Julia ’s grievances against him , and he had often thought that a reaction from his ways probably explained the lifeless neatness of the Anderson Brant drawing - room . Campton had fled to Montmartre to escape a number of things : first of all , the possibility of meeting people who would want to talk about the European situation , then of being called up by Mrs. Brant , and lastly of having to lunch alone in a fashionable restaurant . In his morbid dread of seeing people he would have preferred an omelette in the studio , if only Mariette had been at hand to make it ; and he decided , after a vain struggle with his muddled “
15716	15910	15209	15209	Adele	220	” to cross over to the Luxembourg quarter and pick up a meal in a wine - shop . He did not own to himself his secret reason for this decision ; but it caused him , after a glance at his watch , to hasten his steps down the rue Montmartre and bribe a passing taxi to carry him to the Museum of the Luxembourg . He reached it ten minutes before the midday closing , and hastening past the serried statues , turned into a room half - way down the gallery . Whistler ’s Mother and the Carmencita of Sargent wondered at each other from its walls ; and on the same wall with the Whistler hung the picture Campton had come for : his portrait of his son . He had given it to the Luxembourg the day after Mr. Brant had tried to buy it , with the object of inflicting the most cruel slight he could think of on the banker . In the generous summer light the picture shone out on him with a communicative warmth : never had he seen so far into its depths . “
15914	15918	15209	15209	Adele	220	” he thought , “
15931	16014	16015	16015	He	828	” He stood and stared his own eyes full , mentally comparing the features before him with those of the firmer harder George he had left on the terrace of the Crillon , and noting how time , while fulfilling the rich promise of the younger face , had yet taken something from its brightness . Campton , at that moment , found more satisfaction than ever in thinking how it must have humiliated Brant to have the picture given to France . “
16040	16451	16015	16015	He	828	” The satisfaction was worth the sacrifice of the best record he would ever have of that phase of his son ’s youth . At various times afterward he had tried for the same George , but not one of his later studies had that magic light on it . Still , he was glad he had given the picture . It was safe , safer than it would have been with him . His great dread had always been that if his will were mislaid ( and his things were always getting mislaid ) the picture might be sold , and fall into Brant ’s hands after his death . The closing signal drove him out of the Museum , and he turned into the first wine - shop . He had advised George to lunch with the Brants , but there was disappointment in his heart . Seeing the turn things were taking , he had hoped the boy would feel the impulse to remain with him . But , after all , at such a time a son could not refuse to go to his mother . Campton pictured the little party of three grouped about the luncheon - table in the high cool dining - room of the Avenue Marigny , with the famous Hubert Robert panels , and the Louis XV silver and Sèvres ; while he , the father , George ’s father , sat alone at the soiled table of a frowsy wine - shop . Well — it was he who had so willed it . Life was too crazy a muddle — and who could have foreseen that he might have been repaid for twenty - six years with such a wife by keeping an undivided claim on such a son ? His meal over , he hastened back to the studio , hoping to find the dancer there . Fortin - Lescluze had sworn to bring her at two , and Campton was known to exact absolute punctuality . He had put the final touch to his fame by refusing to paint the mad young Duchesse de la Tour Crenelée — who was exceptionally paintable — because she had kept him waiting three - quarters of an hour . But now , though it was nearly three , and the dancer and her friend had not come , Campton dared not move , lest he should miss Fortin - Lescluze . “
16483	16552	16553	16554	Every one	832	” Campton reflected ; and sulkily sat down to wait . He had never been willing to have a telephone . To him it was a live thing , a kind of Laocoon - serpent that caught one in its coils and dragged one struggling to the receiver . His friends had spent all their logic in trying to argue away this belief ; but he answered obstinately : “
16567	16675	16553	16554	Every one	832	” Even the Russian lady , during her brief reign , had pleaded in vain on this point . He would have given a good deal now if he had listened to her . The terror of having to cope with small material difficulties , always strongest in him in moments of artistic inspiration — when the hushed universe seemed hardly big enough to hold him and his model — this dread anchored him to his seat while he tried to make up his mind to send Mme . Lebel to the nearest telephone - station . If he called to her , she would instantly begin : “
16682	17061	16680	16680	sir	2499	” And he would have to settle that first . Besides , if he did not telephone himself he could not make sure of another appointment with Fortin - Lescluze . But the idea of battling alone with the telephone in a public place covered his large body with a damp distress . If only George had been in reach ! He waited till four , and then , furious , locked the studio and went down . Mme . Lebel still sat in her spidery den . She looked at him gravely , their eyes met , they exchanged a bow , but she did not move or speak . She was busy as usual with some rusty sewing — he thought it odd that she should not rush out to waylay him . Everything that day was odd . He found all the telephone - booths besieged . The people waiting were certainly bad cases of war - funk , to judge from their looks ; after scrutinizing them for a while he decided to return to his hotel , and try to communicate with Fortin - Lescluze from there . To his annoyance there was not a taxi to be seen . He limped down the slope of Montmartre to the nearest métro - station , and just as he was preparing to force his lame bulk into a crowded train , caught sight of a solitary horse - cab : a vehicle he had not risked himself in for years . The cab - driver , for gastronomic reasons , declined to take him farther than the Madeleine ; and getting out there , Campton walked along the rue Royale . Everything still looked wonderfully as usual ; and the fountains in the Place sparkled gloriously . Comparatively few people were about : he was surprised to see how few . A small group of them , he noticed , had paused near the doorway of the Ministry of Marine , and were looking — without visible excitement — at a white paper pasted on the wall . He crossed the street and looked too . In the middle of the paper , in queer Gothic - looking characters , he saw the words = “
17070	17201	16680	16680	sir	2499	”= War had come — — He knew now that he had never for an instant believed it possible . Even when he had had that white - lipped interview with the Brants , even when he had planned to take Fortin - Lescluze by his senile infatuation , and secure a medical certificate for George ; even then , he had simply been obeying the superstitious impulse which makes a man carry his umbrella when he goes out on a cloudless morning . War had come . He stood on the edge of the sidewalk , and tried to think — now that it was here — what it really meant : that is , what it meant to him . Beyond that he had no intention of venturing . “
17209	17247	16680	16680	sir	2499	” he muttered , repeating the phrase with which he had bolstered up his talk with Julia . But abstract thinking was impossible : his confused mind could only snatch at a few drifting scraps of purpose . “
17253	17296	17297	17297	War	236	” he said to himself . The first thing to do was to get back to the hotel and call up the physician . He strode along at his fastest limp , suddenly contemptuous of the people who got in his way . “
17315	17430	17312	17313	the French	208	” He found himself hating the French . He remembered that he had asked to have his sleepings engaged for the following night . But even if he managed to secure his son ’s discharge , there could be no thought , now , of George ’s leaving the country ; and he stopped at the desk to cancel the order . There was no one behind the desk : one would have said that confusion prevailed in the hall , if its emptiness had not made the word incongruous . At last a waiter with rumpled hair strayed out of the restaurant , and of him , imperiously , Campton demanded the concierge . “
17438	17439	17434	17434	He	837	” “
17447	17453	17434	17434	He	837	” The waiter looked blank . “
17468	17469	17484	17484	I	0	” “
17487	17538	17474	17475	some one	839	” cried Campton wrathfully . He invaded the inner office and challenged a secretary who was trying to deal with several unmanageable travellers , but who explained to him , patiently , that his sleepings had certainly not been engaged , as no trains were leaving Paris for the present . “
17544	17564	17474	17475	some one	839	” he added , still more patiently . Campton had a sudden sense of suffocation . No trains leaving Paris “
17568	17630	17484	17484	I	0	” ? But then people like himself — people who had nothing on earth to do with the war — had been caught like rats in a trap ! He reflected with a shiver that Mrs. Brant would not be able to return to Deauville , and would probably insist on his coming to see her every day . He asked : “
17640	17726	17851	17851	they	842	last?”—but no one answered , and he stalked to the lift and had himself carried upstairs . He was confident that George would be there waiting ; but the sitting - room was empty . He felt as if he were on a desert island , with the last sail disappearing over the dark rim of the world . After much vain ringing he got into communication with Fortin ’s house , and heard a confused voice saying that the physician had already left Paris . “
17736	17743	17744	17745	The doctor	840	” And then the eternal answer : “
17756	17842	17843	17843	I	0	” Mobilised — already ? Within the first twenty - four hours ? A man of Fortin ’s age and authority ? Campton was terrified by the uncanny rapidity with which events were moving , he whom haste had always confused and disconcerted , as if there were a secret link between his lameness and the movements of his will . He rang up Dastrey , but no one answered . Evidently his friend was out , and his friend ’s _ bonne _ also . “
17859	17918	17851	17851	they	842	” At last , from sheer over - agitation , his fatigued mind began to move more deliberately : he collected his wits , laboured with his more immediate difficulties , and decided that he would go to Fortin - Lescluze ’s house , on the chance that the physician had not , after all , really started . “
17931	18045	17922	17922	he	841	” Campton reasoned . The hall of the hotel was emptier than ever , and no taxi was in sight down the whole length of the rue Royale , or the rue Boissy d’Anglas , or the rue de Rivoli : not even a horse - cab showed against the deserted distances . He crossed to the métro , and painfully descended its many stairs . VI Campton , proffering twenty francs to an astonished maid - servant , learned that , yes , to his intimates — and of course Monsieur was one?—the doctor _ was _ in , was in fact dining , and did not leave till the next morning . “
18052	18053	18054	18054	Monsieur	844	” “
18074	18091	18058	18059	Monsieur Jean	239	” Campton sent in his card . He expected to be received in the so - called “
18094	18394	18395	18395	Monsieur	847	” a lofty room with Chinese hangings , Renaissance choir - stalls , organ , grand piano , and post - impressionist paintings , where Fortin - Lescluze received the celebrities of the hour . Mme . Fortin never appeared there , and Campton associated the studio with amusing talk , hot - house flowers , and ladies lolling on black velvet divans . He supposed that the physician was separated from his wife , and that she had a home of her own . When the maid reappeared she did not lead him to the studio , but into a small dining - room with the traditional Henri II sideboard of waxed walnut , a hanging table - lamp under a beaded shade , an India - rubber plant on a plush pedestal , and napkins that were just being restored to their bone rings by the four persons seated about the red - and - white checkered table - cloth . These were : the great man himself , a tall large woman with grey hair , a tiny old lady , her face framed in a peasant ’s fluted cap , and a plain young man wearing a private ’s uniform , who had a nose like the doctor ’s and simple light blue eyes . The two ladies and the young man — so much more interesting to the painter ’s eye than the sprawling beauties of the studio — were introduced by Fortin - Lescluze as his wife , his mother and his son . Mme . Fortin said , in a deep alto , a word or two about the privilege of meeting the famous painter who had portrayed her husband , and the old mother , in a piping voice , exclaimed : “
18422	18423	18418	18418	He	848	” “
18446	18457	18458	18458	You	853	” the physician said , laying his hand on hers . “
18472	18541	18458	18458	You	853	” her daughter - in - law added , smiling . Campton took coffee with them , bore with a little inevitable talk about the war , and then eagerly questioned the son . The young man was a chemist , a _ préparateur _ in the laboratory of the Institut Pasteur . He was also , it appeared , given to prehistoric archæology , and had written a “
18543	18587	18458	18458	You	853	” on the painted caves of the Dordogne . He seemed extremely serious , and absorbed in questions of science and letters . But it appeared to him perfectly simple to be leaving it all in a few hours to join his regiment . “
18603	18703	18458	18458	You	853	” he said , in the words of Mme . Lebel . He was to start in an hour , and Campton excused himself for intruding on the family , who seemed as happily united , as harmonious in their deeper interests , as if no musical studio - parties and exotic dancers had ever absorbed the master of the house . Campton , looking at the group , felt a pang of envy , and thought , for the thousandth time , how frail a screen of activity divided him from depths of loneliness he dared not sound . “
18714	18731	18458	18458	You	853	” he muttered as he followed the physician . In the consulting - room he explained : “
18739	18938	18735	18736	my son	856	” He had not been able to bring the phrase out in the presence of the young man who must have been just George ’s age , and who was leaving in an hour for his regiment . But between Campton and the father there were complicities , and there might therefore be accommodations . In the consulting - room one breathed a lower air . It was not that Campton wanted to do anything underhand . He was genuinely anxious about George ’s health . After all , tuberculosis did not disappear in a month or even a year : his anxiety was justified . And then George , but for the stupid accident of his birth , would never have been mixed up in the war . Campton felt that he could make his request with his head high . Fortin - Lescluze seemed to think so too ; at any rate he expressed no surprise . But could anything on earth have surprised him , after thirty years in that confessional of a room ? The difficulty was that he did not see his way to doing anything — not immediately , at any rate . “
18977	18978	18974	18974	I	0	” “
18985	18986	18989	18989	I	0	” “
19007	19038	19039	19039	You	857	” Campton lingered , unable to take this as final . He looked about him uneasily , and then , for a moment , straight into the physician ’s eyes . “
19055	19056	19039	19039	You	857	” “
19061	19086	19039	19039	You	857	” the father assented , in the absent - minded tone of professional sympathy . But Campton felt that he felt the deep difference . “
19094	19115	19118	19118	Jean	239	” As Campton turned to go the physician laid a hand on his shoulder and spoke with sudden fierce emotion . “
19147	19181	19182	19186	A son in the war	870	” There was no allusion to the dancer , no hint that Fortin remembered her ; it was Campton who lowered his gaze before the look in the other father ’s eyes . VII “
19189	19357	19182	19186	A son in the war	870	” The words followed Campton down the stairs . What did it mean , and what must it feel like , for parents in this safe denationalized modern world to be suddenly saying to each other with white lips : A son in the war ? He stood on the kerbstone , staring ahead of him and forgetting whither he was bound . The world seemed to lie under a spell , and its weight was on his limbs and brain . Usually any deep inward trouble made him more than ever alive to the outward aspect of things ; but this new world in which people talked glibly of sons in the war had suddenly become invisible to him , and he did not know where he was , or what he was staring at . He noted the fact , and remembered a story of St. Bernard — he thought it was — walking beside a beautiful lake in supersensual ecstasy , and saying afterward : “
19369	19420	19363	19363	I	0	” On the way back to the hotel he passed the American Embassy , and had a vague idea of trying to see the Ambassador and find out if the United States were not going to devise some way of evading the tyrannous regulation that bound young Americans to France . “
19429	19579	19580	19580	Hullo	243	” he heard himself exclaiming . The remark sounded exactly like one of Julia ’s , and this reminded him that the Ambassador frequently dined at the Brants ’ . They had certainly not left his door untried ; and since , to the Brant circles , Campton was still a shaggy Bohemian , his appeal was not likely to fortify theirs . His mind turned to Jorgenstein , and the vast web of the speculator ’s financial relations . But , after all , France was on the verge of war , if not in it ; and following up the threads of the Jorgenstein web was likely to land one in Frankfort or Vienna . At the hotel he found his sitting - room empty ; but presently the door opened and George came in laden with books , fresh yellow and grey ones in Flammarion wrappers . “
19584	19591	19582	19582	Dad	205	” he said ; and added : “
19599	19600	19582	19582	Dad	205	” “
19608	19612	19582	19582	Dad	205	” said Campton . “
19616	19617	19582	19582	Dad	205	” “
19626	19627	19628	19628	Provender	244	” “
19653	19693	19645	19651	a chap who ’s in my regiment	876	” Campton felt a sudden relief . The purchase of the books proved that George was fairly sure he would not be sent to the front . His father went up to him and tapped him on the chest . “
19700	19706	19707	19707	I	0	” He wanted to add : “
19720	19738	19715	19715	he	182	” ; but though George ’s eye was cool and unenthusiastic it did not encourage such confidences . “
19750	19767	19745	19745	I	0	” He paused , and stooped to turn over the books . Carelessly , he added : “
19784	19785	19745	19745	I	0	” “
19789	19849	19745	19745	I	0	” Campton agreed . It was clear that the boy hated what was ahead of him ; and what more could his father ask ? Of course he was not going to confess to a desire to shirk his duty ; but it was easy to see that his whole lucid intelligence repudiated any sympathy with the ruinous adventure . “
19855	19881	19883	19883	she	879	” Campton enquired , and George replied that he had dropped in for five minutes , and that Miss Anthony wanted to see his father . “
19887	19888	19883	19883	she	879	” “
19920	19921	19924	19924	I	0	” “
19933	19953	19927	19927	Adele	245	” Father and son were silent , both busy lighting cigarettes . When George ’s was lit he remarked : “
19979	20021	20023	20023	they	881	” Campton stared , not knowing the book even by name . What a queer changeling the boy was ! But George ’s composure , his deep and genuine indifference to the whole political turmoil , once more fortified his father . “
20028	20032	20033	20033	They	881	” he ventured . “
20035	20045	20033	20033	They	881	” in their private language , meant the Brants . “
20077	20078	20033	20033	They	881	” “
20083	20084	20085	20085	Nobody	882	” “
20099	20107	20089	20090	the bankers	883	” George paused , and finally added : “
20126	20131	20132	20132	She	885	” Campton hardened instantly . “
20141	20142	20132	20132	She	885	” “
20150	20223	20146	20146	she	885	” The son began to cut the pages of one of his books with a visiting - card he had picked up , and the father stood looking out on the Place de la Concorde through the leafy curtain of the terrace . Campton knew that he could not refuse his son ’s request ; in his heart of hearts he was glad it had been made , since it might mean that “
20225	20324	20369	20369	he	220	” had found a way — perhaps through the Ambassador . But he could never prevent a stiffening of his whole self at any summons or suggestion from the Brants . He thought of the seeming unity of the Fortin - Lescluze couple , and of the background of peaceful family life revealed by the scene about the checkered table - cloth . Perhaps that was one of the advantages of a social organization which still , as a whole , ignored divorce , and thought any private condonation better than the open breaking up of the family . “
20333	20337	20328	20328	I	0	” he agreed . “
20343	20344	20328	20328	I	0	” “
20376	20377	20369	20369	he	220	” “
20382	20383	20378	20378	Boylston	247	” “
20427	20500	20418	20418	he	247	” The father ’s heart sank . Only one whole day more with his boy , and this last evening but one was to be spent with poor embittered Dastrey , and two youths , one unknown to Campton , who would drown them in stupid war - chatter ! But it was what George wanted ; and there must not be a shade , for George , on these last hours . “
20514	20519	20504	20504	You	0	” Campton grinned sardonically . “
20528	20529	20524	20524	I	0	” “
20552	20553	20544	20544	you	0	” “
20560	20733	20558	20558	Boylston	247	” said George . * * * * * Dastrey , after all , turned out less tragic and aggressive than Campton had feared . His irritability had vanished , and though he was very grave he seemed preoccupied only with the fate of Europe , and not with his personal stake in the affair . But the older men said little . The youngsters had the floor , and Campton , as he listened to George and young Louis Dastrey , was overcome by a sense of such dizzy unreality that he had to grasp the arms of his ponderous leather armchair to assure himself that he was really in the flesh and in the world . What ! Two days ago they were still in the old easy Europe , a Europe in which one could make plans , engage passages on trains and steamers , argue about pictures , books , theatres , ideas , draw as much money as one chose out of the bank , and say : “
20750	20802	20740	20740	I	0	” And here they sat in their same evening clothes , about the same shining mahogany writing - table , apparently the same group of free and independent youths and elderly men , and in reality prisoners , every one of them , hand - cuffed to this hideous masked bully of “
20804	20880	20544	20544	you	0	” ! The young men were sure that the conflict was inevitable — the evening papers left no doubt of it — and there was much animated discussion between young Dastrey and George . Already their views diverged ; the French youth , theoretically at one with his friend as to the senselessness of war in general , had at once resolutely disengaged from the mist of doctrine the fatal necessity of this particular war . “
20997	21073	20949	20949	she	55	” It was wonderful to Campton that this slender learned youth should already have grasped the necessity of the conflict and its deep causes . While his own head was still spinning with wrath and bewilderment at the bottomless perversity of mankind , Louis Dastrey had analyzed and accepted the situation and his own part in it . And he was not simply resigned ; he was trembling with eagerness to get the thing over . “
21091	21095	20949	20949	she	55	” he declared . “
21126	21139	21116	21116	I	0	” his uncle interposed ; but Louis flung him a radiant look . “
21149	21150	21116	21116	I	0	” “
21158	21169	21116	21116	I	0	” said Boylston explosively . He had not spoken before . “
21182	21542	21116	21116	I	0	” quoted George , as he poured a golden Hock into his glass . He was keenly interested , that was evident ; but interested as a looker - on , a dilettante . He had neither Valmy nor Sedan in his blood , and it was as a sympathizing spectator that he ought by rights to have been sharing his friend ’s enthusiasm , not as a combatant compelled to obey the same summons . Campton , glancing from one to another of their brilliant faces , felt his determination harden to save George from the consequences of his parents ’ stupid blunder . After dinner young Dastrey proposed a music - hall . The audience would be a curious sight : there would be wild enthusiasm , and singing of the Marseillaise . The other young men agreed , but their elders , after a tacitly exchanged glance , decided to remain at the club , on the plea that some one at the Ministry of War had promised to telephone if there were fresh news . Campton and Dastrey , left alone , stood on the balcony watching the Boulevards . The streets , so deserted during the day , had become suddenly and densely populated . Hardly any vehicles were in sight : the motor omnibuses were already carrying troops to the stations , there was a report abroad that private motors were to be requisitioned , and only a few taxis and horse - cabs , packed to the driver ’s box with young men in spick - and - span uniforms , broke through the mass of pedestrians which filled the whole width of the Boulevards . This mass moved slowly and vaguely , swaying this way and that , as though it awaited a portent from the heavens . In the glare of electric lamps and glittering theatre - fronts the innumerable faces stood out vividly , grave , intent , slightly bewildered . Except when the soldiers passed no cries or songs came from the crowd , but only the deep inarticulate rumour which any vast body of people gives forth . “
21561	21589	21554	21554	you	898	” Campton questioned . But Dastrey had grown belligerent again . He saw the throngs before him bounding toward the frontier like the unchained furies of Rude ’s “
21591	21864	21865	21865	Hullo	243	” ; whereas to Campton they seemed full of the dumb wrath of an orderly and laborious people upon whom an unrighteous quarrel has been forced . He knew that the thought of Alsace - Lorraine still stirred in French hearts ; but all Dastrey ’s eloquence could not convince him that these people wanted war , or would have sought it had it not been thrust on them . The whole monstrous injustice seemed to take shape before him , and to brood like a huge sky - filling dragon of the northern darknesses over his light - loving , pleasure - loving , labour - loving France . * * * * * George came home late . It was two in the morning of his last day with his boy when Campton heard the door open , and saw a flash of turned on light . All night he had lain staring into the darkness , and thinking , thinking : thinking of George ’s future , George ’s friends , George and women , of that unknown side of his boy ’s life which , in this great upheaval of things , had suddenly lifted its face to the surface . If war came , if George were not discharged , if George were sent to the front , if George were killed , how strange to think that things the father did not know of might turn out to have been the central things of his son ’s life ! The young man came in , and Campton looked at him as though he were a stranger . “
21875	21915	21872	21873	the Ministry	899	” George , tossing aside his hat and stick , sat down on the bed . He had a crumpled rose in his button - hole , and looked gay and fresh , with the indestructible freshness of youth . “
21924	21972	21918	21918	I	0	” the father asked himself . Yes : Dastrey had had news . Germany had already committed acts of overt hostility on the frontier : telegraph and telephone communications had been cut , French locomotives seized , troops massed along the border on the specious pretext of the “
21979	21984	21918	21918	I	0	” It was war . “
21989	22001	21918	21918	I	0	” George shrugged . He lit a cigarette , and asked : “
22009	22010	22004	22004	you	205	” “
22015	22016	22011	22011	Boylston	247	” “
22024	22025	22017	22020	The fat brown chap	901	” “
22033	22103	22017	22020	The fat brown chap	901	” Campton became aware that he had not thought of Boylston at all , had hardly been aware of his presence . But the painter ’s registering faculty was always latently at work , and in an instant he called up a round face , shyly jovial , with short - sighted brown eyes as sharp as needles , and dark hair curling tightly over a wide watchful forehead . “
22110	22111	22106	22106	I	0	” “
22142	22143	22132	22132	he	900	” “
22166	22167	22164	22164	he	900	” “
22190	22489	22181	22181	He	900	” George concluded . VIII That morning the irrevocable stared at him from the head - lines of the papers . The German Ambassador was recalled . Germany had declared war on France at 6.40 the previous evening ; there was an unintelligible allusion , in the declaration , to French aeroplanes throwing bombs on Nuremberg and Wesel . Campton read that part of the message over two or three times . Aeroplanes throwing bombs ? Aeroplanes as engines of destruction ? He had always thought of them as a kind of giant kite that fools went up in when they were tired of breaking their necks in other ways . But aeroplane bombardment as a cause for declaring war ? The bad faith of it was so manifest that he threw down the papers half relieved . Of course there would be a protest on the part of the allies ; a great country like France would not allow herself to be bullied into war on such a pretext . The ultimatum to Belgium was more serious ; but Belgium ’s gallant reply would no doubt check Germany on that side . After all , there was such a thing as international law , and Germany herself had recognized it .... So his mind spun on in vain circles , while under the frail web of his casuistry gloomed the obstinate fact that George was mobilised , that George was to leave the next morning . The day wore on : it was the shortest and yet most interminable that Campton had ever known . Paris , when he went out into it , was more dazzlingly empty than ever . In the hotel , in the hall , on the stairs , he was waylaid by flustered compatriots—“Oh
22507	22562	22181	22181	He	900	you_!”—who appealed to him for the very information he was trying to obtain for himself : how one could get money , how one could get hold of the concierge , how one could send cables , if there was any restaurant where the waiters had not all been mobilised , if he had any “
22564	22589	22181	22181	He	900	” at the Embassy , or at any of the steamship offices , or any of the banks . One disordered beauty blurted out : “
22599	22771	22772	22772	Julia	214	Brant”—and was only waked to her mistake by Campton ’s indignant stare , and his plunge past her while she called out excuses . But the name acted as a reminder of his promise to go and see Mrs. Brant , and he decided to make his visit after lunch , when George would be off collecting last things . Visiting the Brants with George would have been beyond his capacity . * * * * * The great drawing - rooms , their awnings spread against the sun , their tall windows wide to the glow of the garden , were empty when he entered ; but in a moment he was joined by a tall angular woman with a veil pushed up untidily above her pink nose . Campton reflected that he had never seen Adele Anthony in the daytime without a veil pushed up above a flushed nose , and dangling in irregular wisps from the back of a small hard hat of which the shape never varied . “
22790	22860	22781	22781	she	214	” He was glad to have a word with her before meeting Mrs. Brant , though his impulse had been almost as strong to avoid the one as the other . He dreaded belligerent bluster as much as vain whimpering , and in the depths of his soul he had to own that it would have been easier to talk to Mr. Brant than to either of the women . “
22867	22872	22873	22873	She	214	” Miss Anthony continued . “
22891	22898	22885	22885	you	0	” Campton made an impatient gesture . “
22908	22909	22885	22885	you	0	” “
22925	22963	22919	22919	George	175	” She paused , and then bounced round on him abruptly . She always moved and spoke in explosions , as if the wires that agitated her got tangled , and then were too suddenly jerked loose . “
22970	22971	22967	22967	George	175	” “
22978	22979	22967	22967	George	175	” “
22992	23014	22967	22967	George	175	” Campton reddened under her lashless blue gaze , and the consciousness of doing so made his answer all the curter . “
23024	23042	23019	23019	you	0	” The shot appeared to reach the mark , for an answering blush suffused her sallow complexion . “
23053	23078	23043	23043	You	0	” she laughed . Something in her tone reminded him of all her old dogged loyalties , and made him ashamed of his taunt . “
23081	23085	23043	23043	You	0	” he grumbled , “
23095	23096	23043	23043	You	0	” “
23122	23148	23120	23120	him	175	” Her capricious adoption of American slang , fitted anyhow into her old - fashioned and punctilious English , sometimes amused but oftener exasperated Campton . “
23178	23197	23120	23120	him	175	” he jeered , trying to laugh off his exasperation . She let this pass with a smile . “
23231	23232	23233	23233	He	175	” “
23263	23332	23254	23254	You	0	” The door opened , and Mrs. Brant came in . Her appearance answered to Miss Anthony ’s description . A pearly mist covered her face , and some reviving liquid had cleared her congested eyes . Her poor hands had suddenly grown so thin and dry that the heavy rings , slipping down to the joints , slid back into place as she shook hands with Campton . “
23338	23342	23254	23254	You	0	” she said . “
23346	23400	23254	23254	You	0	” he protested , helpless , and disturbed by Miss Anthony ’s presence . At the moment his former wife ’s feelings were more intelligible to him than his friend ’s : the maternal fibre stirred in her , and made her more appealing than any elderly virgin on the war - path . “
23408	23440	23401	23401	I	0	” said the elderly virgin , as if guessing his thought . Her queer shallow eyes included them both in a sweeping glance , and she flung back from the threshold : “
23450	23526	23445	23445	you	0	” What they had to say to each other did not last many minutes . The Brants had made various efforts , but had been baffled on all sides by the general agitation and confusion . In high quarters the people they wanted to see were inaccessible ; and those who could be reached lent but a distracted ear . The Ambassador had at once declared that he could do nothing ; others vaguely promised they “
23528	23539	23547	23547	he	175	see”—but hardly seemed to hear what they were being asked . “
23551	23617	23547	23547	he	175	” Mrs. Brant lamented . The reassurance that Campton brought from Fortin - Lescluze , vague though it was , came to her as a miraculous promise , and raised Campton suddenly in her estimation . She looked at him with a new confidence , and he could almost hear her saying to Brant , as he had so often heard her say to himself : “
23636	23747	23882	23882	I	0	” Her gratitude gave him the feeling of having been engaged in something underhand and pusillanimous . He made haste to take leave , after promising to pass on any word he might receive from the physician ; but he reminded her that he was not likely to hear anything till George had been for some days at his base . She acknowledged the probability of this , and clung to him with trustful eyes . She was much disturbed by the preposterous fact that the Government had already requisitioned two of the Brant motors , and Campton had an idea that , dazzled by his newly - developed capacity to “
23750	23874	23882	23882	I	0	” she was about to implore him to rescue from the clutches of the authorities her Rolls - Royce and Anderson ’s Delaunay . He was hastening to leave when the door again opened . A rumpled - looking maid peered in , evidently perplexed , and giving way doubtfully to a young woman who entered with a rush , and then paused as if she too were doubtful . She was pretty in an odd dishevelled way , and with her elaborate clothes and bewildered look she reminded Campton of a fashion - plate torn from its page and helplessly blown about the world . He had seen the same type among his compatriots any number of times in the last days . “
23914	23933	23898	23898	I	0	” the visitor began , in a plaintive staccato which matched her sad eyes and her fluttered veils . “
23957	23968	23948	23948	I	0	” She dangled before them a bejewelled mesh - bag . “
24046	24047	24050	24051	Mrs. Talkett	255	” “
24054	24059	24050	24051	Mrs. Talkett	255	” murmured Mrs. Brant . “
24073	24115	24050	24051	Mrs. Talkett	255	” the young lady continued with a studied laugh . She stood between them , artificial and yet so artless , conscious of intruding but evidently used to having her intrusions pardoned ; and her large eyes turned interrogatively to Campton . “
24132	24152	24128	24128	I	0	” said Mrs. Brant ; then , perceiving that her visitor continued to gaze at Campton , she added : “
24168	24169	24165	24166	Mr. Campton	174	” “
24177	24187	24173	24173	I	0	” Mrs. Talkett ’s eyes became devouring and brilliant . “
24222	24230	24213	24213	I	0	” She detained the painter ’s hand . “
24267	24278	24279	24279	I	0	” She added , as if she were risking something : “
24303	24304	24287	24287	We	925	” “
24308	24315	24287	24287	We	925	” said Campton , bowing awkwardly . “
24322	24620	24316	24317	Cursed fools	927	” he anathematized her on the way downstairs . In the street , however , he felt grateful to her for reducing Mrs. Brant to such confusion that she had made no attempt to detain him . His way of life lay so far apart from his former wife ’s that they had hardly ever been exposed to accidents of the kind , and he saw that Julia ’s embarrassment kept all its freshness . The fact set him thinking curiously of what her existence had been since they had parted . She had long since forgotten her youthful art - jargon to learn others more consonant to her tastes . As the wife of the powerful American banker she dispensed the costliest hospitality with the simple air of one who has never learnt that human life may be sustained without the aid of orchids and champagne . With guests either brought up in the same convictions or bent on acquiring them she conversed earnestly and unweariedly about motors , clothes and morals ; but perhaps her most stimulating hours were those brightened by the weekly visit of the Rector of her parish . With happy untrammelled hands she was now free to rebuild to her own measure a corner of the huge wicked welter of Paris ; and immediately it became as neat , as empty , as air - tight as her own immaculate drawing - room . There he seemed to see her , throning year after year in an awful emptiness of wealth and luxury and respectability , seeing only dull people , doing only dull things , and fighting feverishly to defend the last traces of a beauty which had never given her anything but the tamest and most unprofitable material prosperity . “
24637	24666	24634	24635	poor Julia	214	” he mused , wondering that she had been able to put into her life so few of the sensations which can be bought by wealth and beauty . “
24684	24894	24895	24897	The howling blackguards	930	” He was sure all her plans had been made for the coming six months : her week - end sets of heavy millionaires secured for Deauville , and after that for the shooting at the big château near Compiègne , and three weeks reserved for Biarritz before the return to Paris in January . One of the luxuries Julia had most enjoyed after her separation from Campton ( Adele had told him ) had been that of planning things ahead : Mr. Brant , thank heaven , was not impulsive . And now here was this black bolt of war falling among all her carefully balanced arrangements with a crash more violent than any of Campton ’s inconsequences ! As he reached the Place de la Concorde a newsboy passed with the three o’clock papers , and he bought one and read of the crossing of Luxembourg and the invasion of Belgium . The Germans were arrogantly acting up to their menace : heedless of international law , they were driving straight for France and England by the road they thought the most accessible .... In the hotel he found George , red with rage , devouring the same paper : the boy ’s whole look was changed . “
24912	24923	24895	24897	The howling blackguards	930	” The two men stood and stared at each other . “
24929	25007	25008	25008	They	932	” sprang to their lips at the same moment . Never — never ! England would never permit such a violation of the laws regulating the relations between civilized peoples . They began to say both together that after all perhaps it was the best thing that could have happened , since , if there had been the least hesitation or reluctance in any section of English opinion , this abominable outrage would instantly sweep it away . “
25017	25021	25008	25008	They	932	” George exulted . “
25031	25203	25204	25205	Louis Dastrey	209	” Yes ; France was saved if England could put her army into the field at once . But could she ? Oh , for the Channel tunnel at this hour ! Would this lesson at last cure England of her obstinate insularity ? Belgium had announced her intention of resisting ; but what was that gallant declaration worth in face of Germany ’s brutal assault ? A poor little country pledged to a guaranteed neutrality could hardly be expected to hold her frontiers more than forty - eight hours against the most powerful army in Europe . And what a narrow strip Belgium was , viewed as an outpost of France ! These thoughts , racing through Campton ’s mind , were swept out of it again by his absorbing preoccupation . What effect would the Belgian affair have on George ’s view of his own participation in the war ? For the first time the boy ’s feelings were visibly engaged ; his voice shook as he burst out : “
25232	25258	25259	25259	My	0	” Yes , but — Campton pondered , tried to think up Pacifist arguments , remembered his own discussion with Paul Dastrey three days before . “
25286	25287	25281	25282	some people	935	” “
25334	25335	25327	25327	they	241	” “
25349	25353	25327	25327	they	241	” George laughed . “
25360	25404	25327	25327	they	241	” Both were silent again , each thinking his own thoughts . They were apparently the same , for just as Campton was about to ask where George had decided that they should take their last dinner , the young man said abruptly : “
25425	25426	25410	25410	I	0	” “
25431	25432	25410	25410	I	0	” “
25446	25457	25439	25439	I	0	” He smiled a little , his colour rising nervously . “
25512	25532	25503	25503	I	0	” There was a silence . Campton stared out over his son ’s shoulder at the great sunlit square . “
25538	25551	25503	25503	I	0	” he said briskly . This — on George ’s last night ! “
25579	25588	25589	25589	You	937	” George paused , and finally brought out : “
25617	25642	25643	25645	My dear fellow	943	” A weight was lifted from Campton ’s heart , and he felt ashamed of having failed to guess the boy ’s real motive . “
25676	25681	25666	25666	You	937	” George looked relieved . “
25698	25807	25693	25693	my	0	” He went off whistling the waltz from the Rosenkavalier , and Campton returned to his own thoughts . * * * * * He was still revolving them when he went upstairs after a solitary repast in the confused and servantless dining - room . Adele Anthony had telephoned to him to come and dine — after seeing George , he supposed ; but he had declined . He wanted to be with his boy , or alone . As he left the dining - room he ran across Adamson , the American newspaper correspondent , who had lived for years in Paris and was reputed to have “
25811	26538	25693	25693	my	0	” Adamson was grave but confident . In his opinion Russia would probably not get to Berlin before November ( he smiled at Campton ’s astonished outcry ) ; but if England — oh , they were sure of England!—could get her army over without delay , the whole business would very likely be settled before that , in one big battle in Belgium . ( Yes — poor Belgium , indeed ! ) Anyhow , in the opinion of the military experts the war was not likely to last more than three or four months ; and of course , even if things went badly on the western front , which was highly unlikely , there was Russia to clench the business as soon as her huge forces got in motion . Campton drew much comfort from this sober view of the situation , midway between that of the optimists who knew Russia would be in Berlin in three weeks , and of those who saw the Germans in Calais even sooner . Adamson was a levelheaded fellow , who weighed what he said and pinned his faith to facts . Campton managed to evade several people whom he saw lurking for him , and mounted to his room . On the terrace , alone with the serene city , his confidence grew , and he began to feel more and more sure that , whatever happened , George was likely to be kept out of the fighting till the whole thing was over . With such formidable forces closing in on her it was fairly obvious that Germany must succumb before half or even a quarter of the allied reserves had been engaged . Sustained by the thought , he let his mind hover tenderly over George ’s future , and the effect on his character of this brief and harmless plunge into a military career . IX George was gone . When , with a last whistle and scream , his train had ploughed its way out of the clanging station ; when the last young figures clinging to the rear of the last carriage had vanished , and the bare rails again glittered up from the cindery tracks , Campton turned and looked about him . All the platforms of the station were crowded as he had seldom seen any place crowded , and to his surprise he found himself taking in every detail of the scene with a morbid accuracy of observation . He had discovered , during these last days , that his artist ’s vision had been strangely unsettled . Sometimes , as when he had left Fortin ’s house , he saw nothing : the material world , which had always tugged at him with a thousand hands , vanished and left him in the void . Then again , as at present , he saw everything , saw it too clearly , in all its superfluous and negligible reality , instead of instinctively selecting , and disregarding what was not to his purpose . Faces , faces — they swarmed about him , and his overwrought vision registered them one by one . Especially he noticed the faces of the women , women of all ages , all classes . These were the wives , mothers , grandmothers , sisters , mistresses of all those heavily laden trainfuls of French youth . He was struck with the same strong cheerfulness in all : some pale , some flushed , some serious , but all firmly and calmly smiling . One young woman in particular his look dwelt on — a dark girl in a becoming dress — both because she was so pleasant to see , and because there was such assurance in her serenity that she did not have to constrain her lips and eyes , but could trust them to be what she wished . Yet he saw by the way she clung to the young artilleryman from whom she was parting that hers were no sisterly farewells . An immense hum of voices filled the vast glazed enclosure . Campton caught the phrases flung up to the young faces piled one above another in the windows — words of motherly admonishment , little jokes , tender names , mirthful allusions , last callings out : “
26579	26589	26591	26591	Berlin	8	” It was all bright , brave and confident . “
26597	26730	26591	26591	Berlin	8	” Campton thought . He tried to remember what his own last words to George had been , but could not ; yet his throat felt dry and thirsty , as if he had talked a great deal . The train vanished in a roar , and he leaned against a pier to let the crowd flood by , not daring to risk his lameness in such a turmoil . Suddenly he heard loud sobs behind him . He turned , and recognized the hat and hair of the girl whose eyes had struck him . He could not see them now , for they were buried in her hands and her whole body shook with woe . An elderly man was trying to draw her away — her father , probably . “
26739	26740	26591	26591	Berlin	8	” “
26747	27267	26591	26591	Berlin	8	” she hiccoughed , following blindly . The people nearest stared at her , and the faces of other women grew pale . Campton saw tears on the cheeks of an old body in a black bonnet who might have been his own Mme . Lebel . A pale lad went away weeping . But they were all afraid , then , all in immediate deadly fear for the lives of their beloved ! The same fear grasped Campton ’s heart , a very present terror , such as he had hardly before imagined . Compared to it , all that he had felt hitherto seemed as faint as the sensations of a looker - on . His knees failed him , and he grasped a transverse bar of the pier . People were leaving the station in groups of two or three who seemed to belong to each other ; only he was alone . George ’s mother had not come to bid her son goodbye ; she had declared that she would rather take leave of him quietly in her own house than in a crowd of dirty people at the station . But then it was impossible to conceive of her being up and dressed and at the Gare de l’Est at five in the morning — and how could she have got there without her motor ? So Campton was alone , in that crowd which seemed all made up of families . But no — not all . Ahead of him he saw one woman moving away alone , and recognized , across the welter of heads , Adele Anthony ’s adamantine hat and tight knob of hair . Poor Adele ! So she had come too — and had evidently failed in her quest , not been able to fend a way through the crowd , and perhaps not even had a glimpse of her hero . The thought smote Campton with compunction : he regretted his sneering words when they had last met , regretted refusing to dine with her . He wished the barrier of people between them had been less impenetrable ; but for the moment it was useless to try to force a way through it . He had to wait till the crowd shifted to other platforms , whence other trains were starting , and by that time she was lost to sight . At last he was able to make his way through the throng , and as he came out of a side entrance he saw her . She appeared to be looking for a taxi — she waved her sunshade aimlessly . But no one who knew the Gare de l’Est would have gone around that corner to look for a taxi ; least of all the practical Adele . Besides , Adele never took taxis : she travelled in the bowels of the earth or on the dizziest omnibus tops . Campton knew at once that she was waiting for him . He went up to her and a guilty pink suffused her nose . “
27276	27280	27281	27281	I	0	” he said . “
27291	27292	27293	27293	You	0	” “
27313	27314	27306	27306	We	952	” “
27332	27344	27328	27328	I	0	” she jerked back . He slipped his arm through hers . “
27358	27372	27353	27353	you	950	” he said . He saw her pleasure , but she merely answered : “
27383	27384	27381	27381	you	0	” “
27401	27495	27497	27498	a lady	955	” They found one , and sat down among early clerks and shop - girls , and a few dishevelled women with swollen faces whom Campton had noticed in the station . One of them , who sat opposite an elderly man , had drawn out a pocket mirror and was powdering her nose . Campton hated to see women powder their noses — one of the few merits with which he credited Julia Brant was that of never having adopted these dirty modern fashions , of continuing to make her toilet in private “
27500	27532	27497	27498	a lady	955	” as people used to say when he was young . But now the gesture charmed him , for he had recognized the girl who had been sobbing in the station . “
27549	27695	27545	27545	she	956	” he wondered . For he saw that her chocolate was untouched , and that the smile had stiffened on her lips . Since his talk with Adamson he could not bring himself to be seriously alarmed . Fear had taken him by the throat for a moment in the station , at the sound of the girl ’s sobs ; but already he had thrown it off . Everybody agreed that the war was sure to be over in a few weeks ; even Dastrey had come round to that view ; and with Fortin ’s protection , and the influences Anderson Brant could put in motion , George was surely safe — as safe at his depot as anywhere else in this precarious world . Campton poured out Adele ’s coffee , and drank off his own as if it had been champagne . “
27710	27799	27697	27697	you	957	” he enquired abruptly . Miss Anthony knew everything and everybody in the American circle in Paris ; she was a clearing - house of Franco - American gossip , and it was likely enough that if George had special reasons for wishing to spend his last evening away from his family she would know why . But the chance of her knowing what had been kept from him made Campton ’s question , as soon as it was put , seem indiscreet , and he added hastily : “
27806	27811	27814	27814	he	175	” She looked surprised . “
27829	27863	27814	27814	he	175	” She smirked absurdly , her lashless eyes blinking under the pushed - back veil . Campton ’s mind had already strayed from the question . Nothing bored him more than Adele doing the “
27867	27928	27814	27814	he	175	” and he was vexed at having given her such a chance to be silly . What he wanted to know was whether George had spoken to his old friend about his future — about his own idea of his situation , and his intentions and wishes in view of the grim chance which people , with propitiatory vagueness , call “
27932	28394	27814	27814	he	175	” Had the boy left any word , any message with her for any one ? But it was useless to speculate , for if he had , the old goose , true as steel , would never betray it by as much as a twitch of her lids . She could look , when it was a question of keeping a secret , like such an impenetrable idiot that one could not imagine any one ’s having trusted a secret to her . Campton had no wish to surprise George ’s secrets , if the boy had any . But their parting had been so hopelessly Anglo - Saxon , so curt and casual , that he would have liked to think his son had left , somewhere , a message for him , a word , a letter , in case ... in case there was anything premonitory in the sobbing of that girl at the next table . But Adele ’s pink nose confronted him , as guileless as a rabbit ’s , and he went out with her unsatisfied . They parted at the door of the restaurant , and Campton went to the studio to see if there were any news of his maid - servant Mariette . He meant to return to sleep there that night , and even his simple housekeeping was likely to be troublesome if Mariette should not arrive . On the way it occurred to him that he had not yet seen the morning papers , and he stopped and bought a handful . Negotiations , hopes , fears , conjectures — but nothing new or definite , except the insolent fact of Germany ’s aggression , and the almost - certainty of England ’s intervention . When he reached the studio he found Mme . Lebel in her usual place , paler than usual , but with firm lips and bright eyes . Her three grandsons had left for their depots the day before : one was in the _ Chasseurs Alpins _ , and probably already on his way to Alsace , another in the infantry , the third in the heavy artillery ; she did not know where the two latter were likely to be sent . Her eldest son , their father , was dead ; the second , a man of fifty , and a cabinetmaker by trade , was in the territorials , and was not to report for another week . He hoped , before leaving , to see the return of his wife and little girl , who were in the Ardennes with the wife ’s people . Mme . Lebel ’s mind was made up and her philosophy ready for immediate application . “
28434	28483	28485	28487	some one ”	3113	” There was no news of Mariette , and small chance of having any for some days , much less of seeing her . No one could tell how long civilian travel would be interrupted . Mme . Lebel , moved by her lodger ’s plight , promised to “
28487	28778	28485	28487	some one ”	3113	” ; and Campton mounted to the studio . He had left it only two days before , on the day when he had vainly waited for Fortin and his dancer ; and an abyss already divided him from that vanished time . Then his little world still hung like a straw above an eddy ; now it was spinning about in the central vortex . The pictures stood about untidily , and he looked curiously at all those faces which belonged to the other life . Each bore the mark of its own immediate passions and interests ; not one betrayed the least consciousness of coming disaster except the face of poor Madame de Dolmetsch , whose love had enlightened her . Campton began to think of the future from the painter ’s point of view . What a modeller of faces a great war must be ! What would the people who came through it look like , he wondered . His bell tinkled , and he turned to answer it . Dastrey , he supposed ... he had caught a glimpse of his friend across the crowd at the Gare de l’Est , seeing off his nephew , but had purposely made no sign . He still wanted to be alone , and above all not to hear war - talk . Mme . Lebel , however , had no doubt revealed his presence in the studio , and he could not risk offending Dastrey . When he opened the door it was a surprise to see there , instead of Dastrey ’s anxious face , the round rosy countenance of a well - dressed youth with a shock of fair hair above eyes of childish candour . “
28784	28806	28807	28807	I	0	” Campton said , surprised , but divining a compatriot in a difficulty . The youth obeyed , blushing his apologies . “
28814	28833	28809	28810	Benny Upsher	259	” he said , in a tone modest yet confident , as if the name were an introduction . “
28837	28854	28855	28855	You	0	” Campton stammered , cursing his absent - mindedness and his unfailing faculty for forgetting names . “
28867	28871	28865	28865	you	0	” he risked . “
28890	28891	28882	28882	he	175	” “
28900	28911	28895	28895	you	0	” Mr. Upsher ’s blush became a mask of crimson . “

28929	28944	28914	28914	I	0	” The youth stared at the older man with a look of celestial wonder . “
28955	28956	28953	28953	he	175	” “
28963	28964	28966	28966	they	967	” “

29017	29034	29014	29014	I	0	” Mr. Upsher ’s composure seemed to be returning as the necessary preliminaries were cleared away . “
29039	29043	29014	29014	I	0	” he said . “
29057	29058	29060	29060	his	175	” “
29064	29068	29071	29071	I	0	” Campton exclaimed . “
29090	29101	29077	29077	I	0	” He seemed still to be panting with the effort . “
29109	29120	29102	29102	I	0	” he concluded . Campton contemplated him with helpless perplexity . “
29159	29160	29153	29153	you	175	” “
29191	29192	29189	29189	we	974	” “
29222	29253	29215	29215	I	0	” Mr. Upsher ’s powers of stating his case were plainly limited . He pushed back his rumpled hair , looked hard again at his cousin , and repeated doggedly : “
29263	29264	29215	29215	I	0	” “
29268	29361	29215	29215	I	0	” He nodded . Campton groaned . What did the boy mean , and why come to him with such tomfoolery ? At that moment he felt even more unfitted than usual to deal with practical problems , and in spite of the forgotten cousinship it was no affair of his what Madeline Mayhew ’s son wanted to be in . But there was the boy himself , stolid , immovable , impenetrable to hints , and with something in his wide blue eyes like George — and yet so childishly different . “
29377	29381	29215	29215	I	0	” Campton began , “
29391	29392	29384	29384	you	0	” “

29481	29502	29447	29447	I	0	” Campton was conscious of speaking curtly : the boy ’s bland determination was beginning to get on his nerves . “
29508	29516	29447	29447	I	0	” said Benny Upsher , getting up . “
29523	29568	29447	29447	I	0	” he added , holding out a large brown hand . Campton followed him to the door perplexedly . He knew that something ought to be done — but what ? On the threshold he laid his hand impulsively on the youth ’s shoulder . “
29631	29645	29622	29622	me	0	” A gleam of shrewdness flashed through Benny Upsher ’s inarticulate blue eyes . “
29711	29712	29709	29709	we	990	” “
29725	29735	29736	29736	I	0	” The young man groped for the right word . “

29781	29782	29771	29771	you	0	” “
29790	29796	29785	29788	this kind of people	992	” said Benny Upsher cheerfully . “
29857	29864	29845	29845	I	0	” Campton still contemplated him hopelessly . “
29870	29877	29879	29879	his	995	” he wondered . Benny grinned . “

29922	30018	29908	29908	you	0	” Benny simply replied . An hour later Campton still seemed to see him standing there , with obstinate soft eyes repeating the same senseless question . It cost him an effort to shake off the vision . He returned to the Crillon to collect his possessions . On his table was a telegram , and he seized it eagerly , wondering if by some mad chance George ’s plans were changed , if he were being sent back , if Fortin had already arranged something .... He tore open the message , and read : “
30048	30049	30045	30046	Madeline Upsher	264	” “
30053	30055	30045	30046	Madeline Upsher	264	” Campton groaned—“and
30065	30274	30056	30056	I	0	” BOOK II X The war was three months old — three centuries . By virtue of some gift of adaptation which seemed forever to discredit human sensibility , people were already beginning to live into the monstrous idea of it , acquire its ways , speak its language , regard it as a thinkable , endurable , arrangeable fact ; to eat it by day , and sleep on it — yes , and soundly — at night . The war went on ; life went on ; Paris went on . She had had her great hour of resistance , when , alone , exposed and defenceless , she had held back the enemy and broken his strength . She had had , afterward , her hour of triumph , the hour of the Marne ; then her hour of passionate and prayerful hope , when it seemed to the watching nations that the enemy was not only held back but thrust back , and victory finally in reach . That hour had passed in its turn , giving way to the grey reality of the trenches . A new speech was growing up in this new world . There were trenches now , there was a “
30275	30672	30032	30032	you	0	Front”—people were beginning to talk of their sons at the front . The first time John Campton heard the phrase it sent a shudder through him . Winter was coming on , and he was haunted by the vision of the youths out there , boys of George ’s age , thousands and thousands of them , exposed by day in reeking wet ditches and sleeping at night under the rain and snow . People were talking calmly of victory in the spring — the spring that was still six long months away ! And meanwhile , what cold and wet , what blood and agony , what shattered bodies out on that hideous front , what shattered homes in all the lands it guarded ! Campton could bear to think of these things now . _ His _ son was not at the front — was safe , thank God , and likely to remain so ! During the first awful weeks of silence and uncertainty , when every morning brought news of a fresh disaster , when no letters came from the army and no private messages could reach it — during those weeks , while Campton , like other fathers , was without news of his son , the war had been to him simply a huge featureless mass crushing him earthward , blinding him , letting him neither think nor move nor breathe . But at last he had got permission to go to Chalons , whither Fortin , who chanced to have begun his career as a surgeon , had been hastily transferred . The physician , called from his incessant labours in a roughly - improvised operating - room , to which Campton was led between rows of stretchers laden with livid blood - splashed men , had said kindly , but with a shade of impatience , that he had not forgotten , had done what he could ; that George ’s health did not warrant his being discharged from the army , but that he was temporarily on a staff - job at the rear , and would probably be kept there if such and such influences were brought to bear . Then , calling for hot water and fresh towels , the surgeon vanished and Campton made his way back with lowered eyes between the stretchers . The “
30674	31100	31101	31101	You	1001	” in question were brought to bear — not without Anderson Brant ’s assistance — and now that George was fairly certain to be kept at clerical work a good many miles from the danger - zone Campton felt less like an ant under a landslide , and was able for the first time to think of the war as he might have thought of any other war : objectively , intellectually , almost dispassionately , as of history in the making . It was not that he had any doubt as to the rights and wrongs of the case . The painfully preserved equilibrium of the neutrals made a pitiful show now that the monstrous facts of the first weeks were known : Germany ’s diplomatic perfidy , her savagery in the field , her premeditated and systematized terrorizing of the civil populations . Nothing could efface what had been done in Belgium and Luxembourg , the burning of Louvain , the bombardment of Rheims . These successive outrages had roused in Campton the same incredulous wrath as in the rest of mankind ; but being of a speculative mind — and fairly sure now that George would never lie in the mud and snow with the others — he had begun to consider the landslide in its universal relations , as well as in its effects on his private ant - heap . His son ’s situation , however , was still his central thought . That this lad , who was meant to have been born three thousand miles away in his own safe warless country , and who was regarded by the government of that country as having been born there , as subject to her laws and entitled to her protection — that this lad , by the most idiotic of blunders , a blunder perpetrated before he was born , should have been dragged into a conflict in which he was totally unconcerned , should become temporarily and arbitrarily the subject of a foreign state , exposed to whatever catastrophes that state might draw upon itself , this fact still seemed to Campton as unjust as when it first dawned on him that his boy ’s very life might hang on some tortuous secret negotiation between the cabinets of Europe . He still refused to admit that France had any claim on George , any right to his time , to his suffering or to his life . He had argued it out a hundred times with Adele Anthony . “
31329	31330	31336	31336	George	175	” “
31341	31351	31336	31336	George	175	” Adele Anthony asked , raising her pale eyebrows . “
31354	31367	31336	31336	George	175	” Campton thundered , his fist crashing down among her tea things ; “
31387	31422	31423	31423	George	175	” He paused and stared furiously about the little ladylike drawing - room into which Miss Anthony ’s sharp angles were so incongruously squeezed . She made no answer , and he went on : “
31433	31434	31423	31423	George	175	” “
31441	31456	31457	31457	He	175	” Miss Anthony enquired , rescuing his teacup and putting sugar into her own . “
31492	31542	31543	31543	I	0	” Miss Anthony followed his glance about the room , and her eyes paused with his on her own portrait , now in the place of honour over the mantelpiece , where it hung incongruously above a menagerie of china animals and a collection of trophies from the Marne . “
31551	31555	31543	31543	I	0	” she said . “
31598	31729	31591	31591	George	175	” Campton ’s face darkened . He knew it was partly through Brant ’s influence that George had been detached from his regiment and given a staff job in the Argonne ; but Miss Anthony ’s reminder annoyed him . The Brants had acted through sheer selfish cowardice , the desire to safeguard something which belonged to them , something they valued as they valued their pictures and tapestries , though of course in a greater degree ; whereas he , Campton , was sustained by a principle which he could openly avow , and was ready to discuss with any one who had the leisure to listen . He had explained all this so often to Miss Anthony that the words rose again to his lips without an effort . “

43399	43419	43420	43420	Boylston	247	“ These are the things we really give them ; but they cost a lot of money to buy , ”
43483	43548	43549	43549	Boylston	247	“ That was Mme . Beausite .... You did n’t recognize her ? Poor thing ! Her youngest boy is blind : his eyes were put out by a shell . She is very unhappy , and she comes here and helps now and then . Beausite ? Oh no , we never see _ him _ . He ’s only our Honorary President . ”
43569	43588	43561	43561	He	174	“ Poor woman ! What ? The young fellow who did Cubist things ? I had n’t heard .... ”

43695	43730	43731	43731	Boylston	247	“ You mean to sell the sketch , sir ? That will put the Davrils out of anxiety for a long time ; and they ’re in a bad way , as you saw . ”
43740	43744	43731	43731	Boylston	247	“ May I ? ”
43814	43837	43802	43802	he	174	“ We ’re trying to get up an auction of pictures and sketches — and if we could lead off with this .... ”
43901	43921	43882	43882	He	174	“ But perhaps you ’d rather sell it privately ? In that case we should get the money sooner . ”
43962	43976	43977	43977	Boylston	247	“ How are you getting on ? Getting all the help you need ? ”
43980	44090	43977	43977	Boylston	247	“ We need such a lot . People have been very generous : we ’ve had several big sums . But look at those ridiculous clothes downstairs — we get boxes and boxes of such rubbish ! And there are so many applicants , and such hard cases . Take those poor Davrils , for instance . The lame Davril girl has a talent for music : plays the violin . Well , what good does it do her now ? The artists are having an awful time . If this war goes on much longer , it wo n’t be only at the front that they ’ll die . ”

44448	44504	44439	44439	Campton	174	“ I saw a fellow who ’d seen Benny Upsher yesterday on his way to the English front . The young lunatic looked very fit . You know he volunteered in the English army when he found he could n’t get into the French . He ’s likely to get all the fighting he wants . ”

44952	44982	44983	44984	the dealer	1472	“ I know , I know . Well , you ’re likely to have a good many more calls of the same sort before we get this war over , ”
44988	45035	44983	44984	the dealer	1472	“ Anyhow , remember I can place anything you ’ll give me . When people want a Campton it ’s to me they come . I ’ve got standing orders from two clients ... both given before the war , and both good to - day . ”
45058	45068	45069	45070	The dealer	1472	“ Look here : where is this one going ? ”
45083	45130	45069	45070	The dealer	1472	“ Violation of professional secrecy ? Well .... Well ... under constraint I ’ll confess it ’s to a young lady : great admirer , artist herself . Had her order by cable from New York a year ago . Been on the lookout ever since . ”

45245	45309	45311	45312	the dealer	1472	“ I do n’t know what on earth will become of all those poor devils now : Paris cared for them only because she knew Germany would give any money for their things . Personally , as you know , I ’ve always preferred sounder goods : I ’m a classic , my dear Campton , and I can feel only classic art , ”
45335	45369	45370	45370	he	1472	“ But , as long as things go on as they are at present in _ my _ department of the administration , the war ’s not going to end in a hurry , ”

46351	46454	46344	46344	his	247	“ Poor thing ! She ’s a nuisance , but I ’ll fight to the last ditch for her . The chap she lives with was Beausite ’s secretary and understudy , and devilled for him before the war . The poor fellow has come back from the front a complete wreck , and ca n’t even collect the salary Beausite owes him for the last three months before the war . Beausite ’s plea is that he ’s too poor , and that the war lets him out of paying . Of course he counts on our doing it for him . ”

46464	46467	46469	46469	Boylston	247	“ Well , ”
46472	46565	46469	46469	Boylston	247	“ I should n’t wonder if he beat us in the long run . But I ’ll have a try first ; and anyhow the poor girl need n’t know . She used to earn a little money doing fashion - articles , but of course there ’s no market for that now , and I do n’t see how the pair can live . They have a little boy , and there ’s an infirm mother , and they ’re waiting to get married till the girl can find a job . ”

46678	46691	46671	46671	Boylston	247	“ It will pull them through , anyhow , wo n’t it ? ”
46695	46699	46701	46701	Boylston	247	“ Well — — ”
46703	46712	46713	46713	he	247	“ It will if you ’ll endorse it , ”

47148	47177	47128	47128	he	540	“ This money is not ours . If René had lived he would never have sold your picture ; and we would starve rather than betray his trust . ”
47230	47249	47251	47251	Campton	174	“ Starve — nonsense ! My dear young lady , you betray him when you talk like that , ”
47260	47305	47257	47257	her	1542	“ It depends , Monsieur , which things matter most to one . We shall never — my mother and I — do anything that René would not have done . The picture was not ours : we brought it back to you — — ”
47306	47318	47319	47319	Campton	174	“ But if the picture ’s not yours it ’s mine , ”
47322	47344	47319	47319	Campton	174	“ and I ’d a right to sell it , and a right to do what I choose with the money . ”

47434	47586	47587	47587	She	1548	“ It does n’t seem right that only the painters ’ families should benefit by what your committee are doing . And René would have thought so too . He knew so many young men of letters and journalists who , before the war , just managed to keep their families alive ; and in my profession I could tell you of poor music - teachers and accompanists whose work stopped the day war broke out , and who have been living ever since on the crusts their luckier comrades could spare them . René would have let us accept from you help that was shared with others : he would have been so glad , often , of a few francs to relieve the misery we see about us . And this great sum might be the beginning of a co - operative work for artists ruined by the war . ”
47683	47722	47723	47728	this clear - toned young woman	1558	“ It ’s not only a question of saving their dignity : I do n’t believe much in that . You have dignity or you haven’t — and if you have , it does n’t need any saving , ”
47731	47791	47792	47792	She	1558	“ The real question , for all of us artists , is that of keeping our hands in , and our interest in our work alive ; sometimes , too , of giving a new talent its first chance . At any rate , it would mean work and not stagnation ; which is all that most charity produces . ”

49930	50016	49922	49922	she	196	“ I ’ve just left Madge Talkett : you know her , I think ? She ’s at Mme . de Dolmetsch ’s hospital . Something dreadful has happened ... too dreadful . It seems that Mme . de Dolmetsch was very much in love with Ladislas Isador ; a writer , was n’t he ? I do n’t know his books , but Madge tells me they ’re wonderful ... and of course men like that ought not to be sent to the front .... ”
50017	50022	49922	49922	she	196	“ Men like what ? ”
50023	50026	50028	50029	Mrs. Brant	196	“ Geniuses , ”
50031	50184	50028	50029	Mrs. Brant	196	“ He was dreadfully delicate besides , and was doing admirable work on some military commission in Paris ; I believe he knew any number of languages . And poor Mme . de Dolmetsch — you know I ’ve never approved of her ; but things are so changed nowadays , and at any rate she was madly attached to him , and had done everything to keep him in Paris : medical certificates , people at Headquarters working for her , and all the rest . But it seems there are no end of officers always intriguing to get staff - jobs : strong able - bodied young men who ought to be in the trenches , and are fit for nothing else , but who are jealous of the others . And last week , in spite of all she could do , poor Isador was ordered to the front . ”
50248	50253	50254	50254	he	174	“ I ’m sorry , ”
50257	50307	50254	50254	he	174	“ But if you ’ve come to ask me to do something more about George — take any new steps — it ’s no use . I ca n’t do the sort of thing to keep my son safe that Mme . de Dolmetsch would do for her lover . ”
50312	50327	50308	50309	Mrs. Brant	196	“ Safe ? He was killed the day after he got to the front . ”
50328	50334	50335	50336	Ladislas Isador	190	“ Good Lord — Isador ? ”
50435	50442	50443	50443	he	174	“ Poor Mme . de Dolmetsch ! ”
50496	50522	50472	50472	she	196	“ Isador was nearly forty , and had a weak heart ; and she ’d left nothing , literally nothing , undone to save him . ”
50534	50548	50523	50523	Campton	174	“ It ’s impossible _ now _ that George should not be taken , ”
50576	50586	50587	50587	she	196	“ It may be George ’s turn any day , ”
50606	50619	50601	50601	she	196	“ I tell you there ’s not a moment to be lost ! ”
50647	50714	50715	50715	He	174	“ Unless something is done immediately .... It appears there ’s a regular hunt for _ embusqués _ , as they ’re called . As if it was everybody ’s business to be killed ! How ’s the staff - work to be carried on if they ’re all taken ? But it ’s certain that if we do n’t act at once ... act energetically .... ”
50722	50732	50733	50733	he	174	“ Why do you come to _ me _ ? ”
50741	50748	50736	50736	Her	196	“ But he ’s our child . ”
50749	50767	50768	50768	She	196	“ Your husband knows more people — he has ways , you ’ve often told me — — ”
50785	50791	50792	50792	Campton	174	“ Why did you say , ”
50795	50813	50814	50814	She	196	“ that you had come here because you wanted to see me without Brant ’s knowing it ? ”
50830	50848	50816	50816	her	196	“ Because Anderson thinks .... Anderson wo n’t .... He says he ’s done all he can . ”
50849	50853	50855	50855	Campton	174	“ Ah — — ”
50876	50885	50886	50886	he	174	“ I — feel exactly as Brant does , ”
50889	50927	50886	50886	he	174	“ You — you feel as he does ? You , George ’s father ? But a father has never done all he can for his son ! There ’s always something more that he can do ! ”
51002	51009	51010	51010	He	174	“ My dear — I’m sorry . ”
51017	51045	51046	51046	He	174	“ Sorry — sorry ? I do n’t want you to be sorry . I want you to do something — I want you to save him ! ”
51069	51077	51078	51078	he	174	“ I ca n’t do anything more , ”
51089	51106	51081	51081	She	1642	“ What ’s happened to you ? Who has influenced you ? What has changed you ? ”
51518	51521	51522	51522	he	174	“ Julia , ”
51525	51536	51522	51522	he	174	“ Julia , I wish you ’d try to see .... ”
51543	51615	51616	51616	He	174	“ See what ? All I see is _ you _ , sitting here safe and saying you can do nothing to save him ! But to have the right to say that you ought to be in the trenches yourself ! What do you suppose those young men out there think of their fathers , safe at home , who are too high - minded and conscientious to protect them ? ”
51622	51625	51626	51626	he	174	“ Yes , ”
51629	51660	51626	51626	he	174	“ that ’s the bitterest part of it . But for that , there would hardly be anything in the worst war for us old people to lie awake about . ”
51742	51749	51750	51750	she	196	“ You need n’t come down , ”
51767	51785	51764	51764	he	174	“ I ’ll give you a light : the concierge has forgotten the lamp on the stairs . ”
51929	51932	51933	51933	she	195	“ Jules , ”
51936	51944	51933	51933	she	195	“ last Wednesday ... through the heart . ”
52004	52021	51995	51996	the chauffeur	1679	“ Poor old lady — yes , her only son ’s been killed at the front . ”
52168	52178	52179	52179	Campton	174	“ It always comes back to the same thing , ”
52184	52217	52179	52179	Campton	174	“ What right have useless old men like me , sitting here with my cigar by this good fire , to preach blood and butchery to boys like George and your nephew ? ”
52415	52461	52399	52399	He	209	“ I see . Your idea is that , being unable to do even the humble kind of job that I ’ve been assigned to , you ’ve no right _ not _ to try to keep your boy out of it if you can ? ”
52462	52470	52471	52471	Dastrey	188	“ Well — by any honourable means . ”
52479	52489	52471	52471	Dastrey	188	“ The word ’s not happy , I admit . ”
52490	52534	52536	52536	Dastrey	188	“ I was n’t thinking of that : I was considering how the meaning had evaporated out of lots of our old words , as if the general smash - up had broken their stoppers . So many of them , you see , ”
52539	52595	52536	52536	Dastrey	188	“ we ’d taken good care not to uncork for centuries . Since I ’ve been on the edge of what ’s going on fifty miles from here a good many of my own words have lost their meaning , and I ’m not prepared to say where honour lies in a case like yours . ”
52606	52614	52596	52596	He	188	“ What would George ’s view be ? ”
52736	52743	52744	52744	he	174	“ As far as I know , ”
52747	52755	52744	52744	he	174	“ George has n’t changed his mind . ”
52776	52783	52784	52784	Dastrey	188	“ Whereas _ you _ — — ”
52787	52790	52792	52792	Campton	174	“ Yes , ”
52794	52920	52792	52792	Campton	174	“ I feel differently . You speak of the difference of having been in contact with what ’s going on out there . But how can anybody _ not _ be in contact , who has any imagination , any sense of right and wrong ? Do these pictures and hangings ever shut it out from you — or those books over there , when you turn to them after your day ’s work ? Perhaps they do , because you ’ve got a real job , a job you ’ve been ordered to do , and ca n’t not do . But for a useless drifting devil like me — my God , the sights and the sounds of it are always with me ! ”
52921	52938	52940	52940	Boylston	247	“ There are a good many people who would n’t call you useless , Mr. Campton , ”
52947	52981	52944	52944	his	174	“ I wish there were any healing in the kind of thing I ’m doing ; perhaps there is to you , to whom it appears to come naturally to love your kind . ”
52987	53070	53071	53071	he	247	“ Service is of no use without conviction : that ’s one of the uncomfortable truths this stir - up has brought to the surface . I was meant to paint pictures in a world at peace , and I should have more respect for myself if I could go on unconcernedly doing it , instead of pining to be in all the places where I ’m not wanted , and should be of no earthly use . That ’s why — — ”
53087	53150	53071	53071	he	247	“ That ’s why I respect George ’s opinion , which really consists in not having any , and simply doing without comment the work assigned to him . The whole thing is so far beyond human measure that one ’s individual rage and revolt seem of no more use than a woman ’s scream at an accident she is n’t in . ”
53193	53218	53185	53185	Dastrey	188	“ Every one can at least contribute an attitude : as you have , my dear fellow . Boylston ’s here to confirm it . ”
53224	53231	53221	53221	his	247	“ An attitude — an attitude ? ”
53235	53308	53232	53232	Campton	174	“ The word is revolting to me ! Anything a man like me can do is too easy to be worth doing . And as for anything one can _ say _ : how dare one say anything , in the face of what is being done out there to keep this room and this fire , and this ragged end of life , safe for such survivals as you and me ? ”
53334	53410	53323	53323	he	247	“ Men of our age are the chorus of the tragedy , Dastrey ; we ca n’t help ourselves . As soon as I open my lips to blame or praise I see myself in white petticoats , with a long beard held on by an elastic , goading on the combatants in a cracked voice from a safe corner of the ramparts . On the whole I ’d sooner be spinning among the women . ”
53411	53414	53416	53416	Dastrey	188	“ Well , ”
53421	53475	53416	53416	Dastrey	188	“ I ’ve got to get back to my spinning at the Ministry ; where , by the way , there are some very pretty young women at the distaff . It ’s extraordinary how much better pretty girls type than plain ones ; I see now why they get all the jobs . ”
53780	53805	53806	53806	he	540	“ Out there — out there , if they had these wet stones under them they ’d think it was the floor of heaven , ”
53822	53825	53806	53806	he	540	“ Out there ”
54131	54138	54141	54141	they	1721	“ The Friends of French Art , ”
54222	54226	54250	54254	the generation to meet it	1735	“ had to be ”
54598	54612	54593	54593	His	174	“ I suppose it ’s hardly time yet to ask for leave — — ”
54730	54738	54713	54716	Mme . de Dolmetsch	179	“ Friends of French Art | | Committee ”
54911	54938	54902	54902	Campton	174	“ Dear Dad , thanks for yours of the tenth , which must have come to me on skis , the snow here is so deep . ”
54957	55029	54902	54902	Campton	174	“ Sorry mother is bothering about things again ; as you ’ve often reminded me , they always have a way of ‘ being as they will be , ’ and even war does n’t seem to change it . Nothing to worry her in my case — but you ca n’t expect her to believe that , can you ? Neither you nor I can help it , I suppose . “
55101	55222	55267	55267	you	1750	“ I wish you ’d see her now and then — just naturally , as if it had happened . You know you ’ve got one Inexhaustible Topic between you . The said I. T. is doing well , and has nothing new to communicate up to now except a change of address . Hereafter please write to my Base instead of directing here , as there ’s some chance of a shift of H.Q. The precaution is probably just a new twist of the old red tape , signifying nothing ; but Base will always reach me if we _ are _ shifted . Let mother know , and explain , please ; otherwise she ’ll think the unthinkable . “
55235	55238	55239	55240	GEORGIUS SCRIBLERIUS	301	“ As ever “
55242	55254	55239	55240	GEORGIUS SCRIBLERIUS	301	“ P.S. Do n’t be too savage to Uncle Andy either . “
55273	55369	55267	55267	you	1750	” It was the first time George had written in that way of his mother . His smiling policy had always been to let things alone , and go on impartially dividing his devotion between his parents , since they refused to share even that common blessing . But war gave everything a new look ; and he had evidently , as he put it , been turning over the old things in his cupboards . How was it possible , Campton wondered , that after such a turning over he was still content to write “
55375	55699	55267	55267	you	1750	” and to make jokes about another big quill - drive ? Glancing at the date of the letter , Campton saw that it had been written on the day after the first ineffectual infantry assault on Vauquois . And George was sitting a few miles off , safe in headquarters at Sainte Menehould , with a stout roof over his head and a beautiful brown gloss on his boots , scribbling punning letters while his comrades fell back from that bloody summit .... Suddenly Campton ’s eyes filled . No ; George had not written that letter for the sake of the joke : the joke was meant to cover what went before it . Ah , how young the boy was to imagine that his father would not see ! Yes , as he said , war made so many of the old things look foolish .... Campton set out for the Palais Royal . He felt happier than for a long time past : the tone of his boy ’s letter seemed to correspond with his own secret change of spirit . He knew the futility of attempting to bring the Brants and himself together , but was glad that George had made the suggestion . He resolved to see Julia that afternoon . At the Palais Royal he found the indefatigable Boylston busy with an exhibition of paintings sent home from the front , and Mlle . Davril helping to catalogue them . Lamentable pensioners came and went , bringing fresh tales of death , fresh details of savagery ; the air was dark with poverty and sorrow . In the background Mme . Beausite flitted about , tragic and ineffectual . Boylston had not been able to extract a penny from Beausite for his secretary and the latter ’s left - handed family ; but Mme . Beausite had discovered a newly - organized charity which lent money to “
55702	55730	55267	55267	you	1750	” war - victims ; and with an artless self - satisfaction she had contrived to obtain a small loan for the victim of her own thrift . “
55740	55806	55807	55808	Mr. Campton	174	” she said , gently disclaiming in advance the praise which Miss Anthony and Boylston had no thought of offering her . Whenever Campton came in she effaced herself behind a desk , where she bent her beautiful white head over a card - catalogue without any perceptible results . The telephone rang . Boylston , after a moment , looked up from the receiver . “
55810	55828	55807	55808	Mr. Campton	174	” The painter glanced apprehensively at the instrument , which still seemed to him charged with explosives . “
55842	55853	55888	55888	they	1752	” There was a listening pause : then Boylston said : “
55860	55865	55857	55857	Upsher	259	” Campton started up . “
55870	55871	55857	55857	Upsher	259	” “
55898	55899	55895	55896	Mr. Mayhew	212	” “
55904	56012	55895	55896	Mr. Mayhew	212	” the painter groaned , the boy ’s face suddenly rising before his blurred eyes . Miss Anthony was not at the office that morning , or he would have turned to her ; at least she might have gone with him on his quest . He could not ask Boylston to leave the office , and he felt that curious incapacity to deal with the raw fact of sorrow which had often given an elfin unreality to the most poignant moments of his life . It was as though experience had to enter into the very substance of his soul before he could even feel it . “
56016	56020	56013	56014	Other people	607	” he thought , “
56032	56122	55895	55896	Mr. Mayhew	212	” Some one , meanwhile , had fetched a cab , and he drove to the Nouveau Luxe , though with little hope of finding Mr. Mayhew . But Mr. Mayhew had grown two secretaries , and turned the shrimp - pink drawing - room into an office . One of the secretaries was there , hammering at a typewriter . She was a competent young woman , who instantly extracted from her pocket - diary the fact that her chief was at Mrs. Anderson Brant ’s , rehearsing . “
56127	56128	55895	55896	Mr. Mayhew	212	” “
56146	56237	56133	56133	he	1755	” she said , surprised at Campton ’s ignorance . She suggested telephoning ; but in the shrunken households of the rich , where but one or two servants remained , telephoning had become as difficult as in the understaffed hotels ; and after one or two vain attempts Campton decided to go to the Avenue Marigny . He felt that to get hold of Mayhew as soon as possible might still in some vague way help poor Benny — since it was not yet sure that he was dead . “
56249	56306	56307	56307	I	0	” he thought , conscious that the only way he had yet found of dealing with calamity was a kind of ant - like agitation . On the way the round pink face of Benny Upsher continued to float before him in its very substance , with the tangibility that only a painter ’s visions wear . “
56317	56342	56307	56307	I	0	” he heard the boy repeating , as if impelled by some blind instinct flowing down through centuries and centuries of persistent childish minds . “
56365	56369	56371	56371	George	175	” Campton mused , “
56395	56880	56373	56375	The average person	1758	” But this consideration , though drawn from George ’s own philosophy , did not greatly comfort his father . At the Brants ’ a bewildered concierge admitted him and rang a bell which no one answered . The vestibule and the stairs were piled with bales of sheeting , bulging jute - bags , stacked - up hospital supplies . A boy in scout ’s uniform swung inadequate legs from the lofty porter ’s armchair beside the table with its monumental bronze inkstand . Finally , from above , a maid called to Campton to ascend . In the drawing - room pictures and tapestries , bronzes and _ pâtes tendres _ , had vanished , and a plain moquette replaced the priceless Savonnerie across whose pompous garlands Campton had walked on the day of his last visit . The maid led him to the ball - room . Through double doors of glass Mr. Mayhew ’s oratorical accents , accompanied by faint chords on the piano , reached Campton ’s ears : he paused and looked . At the far end of the great gilded room , on a platform backed by velvet draperies , stood Mr. Mayhew , a perfect pearl in his tie and a perfect crease in his trousers . Beside him was a stage - property tripod surmounted by a classical perfume - burner ; and on it Mme . de Dolmetsch , swathed in black , leaned in an attitude of affliction . Beneath the platform a bushy - headed pianist struck an occasional chord from Chopin ’s Dead March ; and near the door three or four Red Cross nurses perched on bales of blankets and listened . Under one of their coifs Campton recognized Mrs. Talkett . She saw him and made a sign to the lady nearest her ; and the latter , turning , revealed the astonished eyes of Julia Brant . Campton ’s first impression , while they shook hands under cover of Mr. Mayhew ’s rolling periods , was of his former wife ’s gift of adaptation . She had made herself a nurse ’s face ; not a theatrical imitation of it like Mme . de Dolmetsch ’s , nor yet the face of a nurse on a war - poster , like Mrs. Talkett ’s . Her lovely hair smoothed away under her strict coif , her chin devoutly framed in linen , Mrs. Brant looked serious , tender and efficient . Was it possible that she had found her vocation ? She gave him a glance of alarm , but his eyes must have told her that he had not come about George , for with a reassured smile she laid a finger on her lip and pointed to the platform ; Campton noticed that her nails were as beautifully polished as ever . Mr. Mayhew was saying : “
56937	56980	56930	56935	the first Victims of that barbarism	1760	” He paused and looked impressively at the bales of blankets . The piano filled in the pause , and Mme . de Dolmetsch , without changing her attitude , almost without moving her lips , sang a few notes of lamentation . “
56987	56993	56994	56994	I	0	” Mr. Mayhew began again . “
57011	57012	57015	57015	him	0	” “
57017	57071	57072	57072	You	1761	” Campton whispered to Mrs. Brant . Little Mrs. Talkett , with the quick intuition he had noted in her , sprang up and threaded her way to the stage . Mme . de Dolmetsch flowed from one widowed pose into another , and Mr. Mayhew , majestically descending , approached Mrs. Brant . “
57125	57131	57088	57089	de Dolmetsch	179	” Mr. Mayhew added modestly , “
57146	57176	57141	57141	I	0	” Mme . de Dolmetsch , with the gesture of a marble mourner torn from her cenotaph , glided up behind him and laid her hand in Campton ’s . “
57202	57220	57192	57192	Cassandra	303	” Tears rained down her cheeks , washing off the paint like mud swept by a shower . “
57225	57237	57192	57192	Cassandra	303	” she added , fixing her perfect eyes on Mr. Mayhew , “
57255	57281	57282	57282	Benny	259	” Mrs. Talkett had said a word to Mr. Mayhew . Campton saw his complacent face go to pieces as if it had been vitrioled . “
57287	57291	57292	57292	Benny	259	” he screamed , “
57310	57317	57305	57305	you	0	” His eyes met Campton ’s . “
57332	57422	57305	57305	you	0	” he cried , plunging his face into his soft manicured hands . In the cab to which Campton led him , he continued to sob with the full - throated sobs of a large invertebrate distress , beating his breast for an unfindable handkerchief , and , when he found it , immediately weeping it into pulp . Campton had meant to leave him at the bank ; but when the taxi stopped Mr. Mayhew was in too pitiful a plight for the painter to resist his entreaty . “
57437	57647	57431	57431	you	1769	” the poor man implored ; and Campton followed him up the majestic stairway . Their names were taken in to Mr. Brant , and with a motion of wonder at the unaccountable humours of fate , Campton found himself for the first time entering the banker ’s private office . Mr. Brant was elsewhere in the great glazed labyrinth , and while the visitors waited , the painter ’s registering eye took in the details of the room , from the Barye _ cire - perdue _ on a peach - coloured marble mantel to the blue morocco armchairs about a giant writing - table . On the table was an electric lamp in a celadon vase , and just the right number of neatly folded papers lay under a paper - weight of Chinese crystal . The room was as tidy as an expensive stage - setting or the cage of a well - kept canary : the only object marring its order was a telegram lying open on the desk . Mr. Brant , grey and glossy , slipped in on noiseless patent leather . He shook hands with Mr. Mayhew , bowed stiffly but deprecatingly to Campton , gave his usual cough , and said : “
57652	57686	57431	57431	you	1769	” And suddenly , as the three men sat there , so impressive and important and powerless , with that fatal telegram marring the tidiness of the desk , Campton murmured to himself : “
57708	57748	57701	57701	I	0	” Benny Upsher was not dead — at least his death was not certain . He had been seen to fall in a surprise attack near Neuve Chapelle ; the telegram , from his commanding officer , reported him as “
57753	57994	57701	57701	I	0	” The words had taken on a hideous significance in the last months . Freezing to death between the lines , mutilation and torture , or weeks of slow agony in German hospitals : these were the alternative visions associated with the now familiar formula . Mr. Mayhew had spent a part of his time collecting details about the treatment of those who had fallen , alive but wounded , into German hands ; and Campton guessed that as he sat there every one of these details , cruel , sanguinary , remorseless , had started to life , and that all their victims wore the face of Benny . The wretched man sat speechless , so unhinged and swinging loose in his grief that Mr. Brant and Campton could only look on , following the thoughts he was thinking , seeing the sights he was seeing , and each avoiding the other ’s eye lest they should betray to one another the secret of their shared exultation at George ’s safety . Finally Mr. Mayhew was put in charge of a confidential clerk , who was to go with him to the English Military Mission in the hope of getting farther information . He went away , small and shrunken , with the deprecating smile of a man who seeks to ward off a blow ; as he left the room Campton heard him say timidly to the clerk : “
58015	58040	58005	58005	I	0	” Campton had meant to leave at the same time ; but some vague impulse held him back . He remembered George ’s postscript : “
58050	58169	58047	58048	Uncle Andy	229	” and wished he could think of some friendly phrase to ease off his leave - taking . Mr. Brant seemed to have the same wish . He stood , erect and tightly buttoned , one small hand resting on the arm of his desk - chair , as though he were posing for a cabinet size , with the photographer telling him to look natural . His lids twitched behind his protective glasses , and his upper lip , which was as straight as a ruler , detached itself by a hair ’s breadth from the lower ; but no word came . Campton glanced up and down the white - panelled walls , and spoke abruptly . “
58177	58181	58047	58048	Uncle Andy	229	” he said , “
58194	58199	58185	58185	Upsher	259	” Mr. Brant bowed . “
58213	58220	58185	58185	Upsher	259	” Campton continued with rising vehemence , “
58256	58264	58243	58243	George	175	” Mr. Brant looked at him intently . “
58272	58287	58268	58268	George	175	” he asked , with his usual cough before the name . Campton coloured . “
58317	58318	58309	58312	most thoughtful young fellows	1776	” “
58322	58341	58309	58312	most thoughtful young fellows	1776	” said Mr. Brant , cautiously stroking his moustache . Campton ’s eyes again wandered about the room . “
58350	58351	58309	58312	most thoughtful young fellows	1776	” “
58355	58606	58608	58608	mother	821	” The two men looked at each other , and Campton held out his hand . Mr. Brant , growing pink about the forehead , extended his dry fingers , and they shook hands in silence . XVIII In the street Campton looked about him with the same confused sense as when he had watched Fortin - Lescluze driving away to Chalons , his dead son ’s image in his eyes . Each time that Campton came in contact with people on whom this calamity had fallen he grew more acutely aware of his own inadequacy . If he had been Fortin - Lescluze it would have been impossible for him to go back to Chalons and resume his task . If he had been Harvey Mayhew , still less could he have accommodated himself to the intolerable , the really inconceivable , thought that Benny Upsher had vanished into that fiery furnace like a crumpled letter tossed into a grate . Young Fortin was defending his country — but Upsher , in God ’s name what was Benny Upsher of Connecticut doing in a war between the continental powers ? Suddenly Campton remembered that he had George ’s letter in his pocket , and that he had meant to go back with it to Mrs. Brant ’s . He had started out that morning full of the good intentions the letter had inspired ; but now he had no heart to carry them out . Yet George had said : “
58616	58788	58789	58789	George	175	” and such an injunction could not be disregarded . He was still hesitating on a street corner when he remembered that Miss Anthony was probably on her way home for luncheon , and that if he made haste he might find her despatching her hurried meal . It was instinctive with him , in difficult hours , to turn to her , less for counsel than for shelter ; her simple unperplexed view of things was as comforting as his mother ’s solution of the dark riddles he used to propound in the nursery . He found her in her little dining - room , with Delft plates askew on imitation Cordova leather , and a Death ’s Head Pennon and a Prussian helmet surmounting the nymph in cast bronze on the mantelpiece . In entering he faced the relentless light of a ground - glass window opening on an air - shaft ; and Miss Anthony , flinging him a look , dropped her fork and sprang up crying : “
58792	58793	58794	58794	George	175	” “
58799	58813	58797	58797	George	175	” Campton recovered his presence of mind under the shock of her agitation . “
58821	58822	58823	58823	Your	175	” “
58828	58836	58825	58825	your	175	” she stammered , sitting down again . “
58853	58863	58851	58851	Jeanne	287	” she cried over her shoulder to the pantry . “
58889	58890	58880	58880	I’ve	0	” “
58901	58909	58893	58896	that poor young Upsher	259	” Her own face grew instantly serene . “
58938	58947	58948	58948	I	0	” she insisted . He shook his head . “
58952	58953	58948	58948	I	0	” “
58962	59002	58958	58958	I	0	” She led the way into the drawing - room . There it was her turn to face the light , and he saw that her own features were as perturbed as she had apparently discovered his to be . “
59009	59098	59006	59007	poor boy	1780	” she repeated , in the happy voice she might have had if she had been congratulating Campton on the lad ’s escape . He saw that she was still thinking not of Upsher but of George , and her inability to fit her intonation to her words betrayed the violence of her relief . But why had she imagined George to be in danger ? Campton recounted the scene at which he had just assisted , and while she continued to murmur her sympathy he asked abruptly : “
59110	59165	59103	59103	you	1781	” Miss Anthony had taken her usual armchair . It was placed , as the armchairs of elderly ladies usually are , with its high back to the light , and Campton could no longer observe the discrepancy between her words and her looks . This probably gave her laugh its note of confidence . “
59186	59190	59170	59170	you	2497	” she said . “
59212	59216	59201	59201	You	2497	” Campton insisted . “
59225	59232	59201	59201	You	2497	” She shrugged her shoulders in the “
59234	59280	59198	59198	your	2497	” way she had picked up in her youth . The gesture was as incongruous as her slang , but it had become part of her physical self , which lay in a loose mosaic of incongruities over the solid crystal block of her character . “
59296	59297	59298	59298	I	0	” “
59303	59327	59298	59298	I	0	” He pulled out the letter he had received that morning . A sudden light had illuminated it , and his hand shook . “
59339	59353	59356	59356	you	0	” She seemed to hesitate for a moment , and then asked calmly : “
59359	59360	59356	59356	you	0	” “
59385	59403	59375	59375	I	0	” He waited , cursing the faint winter light , and the protecting back of her chair . “
59409	59414	59417	59417	he	175	” he broke out , “
59442	59494	59495	59495	George	175	” Miss Anthony bent her long nose over the page . Her hand held the letter steadily , and he guessed , as she perused it , that she had had one of the same kind , and had already drawn her own conclusions . What they were , that first startled “
59497	59549	59495	59495	George	175	” seemed to say . But would she ever let Campton see as far into her thoughts again ? He continued to watch her hands patiently , since nothing was to be discovered of her face . The hands folded the letter with precision , and handed it back to him . “
59563	59590	59555	59555	you	175	” she surprised him by conceding . Then , darting at his unprotected face a gaze he seemed to feel though he could not see it : “
59610	59670	59606	59606	you	175	” she demanded . He had not expected the question , and though in the last weeks he had so often propounded it to himself , it caught him in the chest like a blow . A sense of humiliation , a longing to lay his weakness bare , suddenly rose in him , and he bowed his head . “
59681	59752	59675	59675	I	0	” he stammered . She was silent for an interval ; then she stood up , and laying her hand on his shaking shoulder crossed the room to a desk in which he knew she kept her private papers . Her keys clinked , and a moment later she handed him a letter . It was in George ’s writing , and dated on the same day as his own . “
59890	60044	59875	59875	Your	1788	” The two letters bore one another out in a way which carried conviction . Campton saw that his sudden doubts must have been produced ( since he had not felt them that morning ) by the agonizing experience he had undergone : the vision of Benny Upsher had unmanned him . George was safe , and asked only to remain so : that was evident from both letters . And as the certainty of his son ’s acquiescence once more penetrated Campton it brought with it a fresh reaction of shame . Ashamed — yes , he had begun to be ashamed of George as well as of himself . Under the touch of Adele Anthony ’s implacable honesty his last pretenses shrivelled up , and he longed to abase himself . He lifted his head and looked at her , remembering all she would be able to read in his eyes . “
60049	60053	60045	60045	You	1795	” she enquired . “
60062	60076	60244	60244	God	266	” He stretched his hand toward her , and then drew it back . “
60092	60124	60244	60244	God	266	” He laboured with the need of self - expression , and the opposing instinct of concealing feelings too complex for Miss Anthony ’s simple gaze . How could he say : “
60138	60241	60244	60244	God	266	” ? And was he satisfied , after all ? And how could he define , or even be sure that he was actually experiencing , a feeling so contradictory that it seemed to be made up of anxiety for his son ’s safety , shame at that anxiety , shame at George ’s own complacent acceptance of his lot , and terror of a possible change in that lot ? There were hours when it seemed to Campton that the Furies were listening , and ready to fling their awful answer to him if he as much as whispered to himself : “
60251	60280	60244	60244	God	266	” The sense of their haunting presence laid its clutch on him , and caused him , after a pause , to finish his phrase in another tone . “
60300	60335	60336	60336	I	0	” he exclaimed . Miss Anthony was folding away the letter as calmly as if it had been a refugee record . She did not appear to notice the change in Campton ’s voice . “
60352	60375	60345	60345	you	1796	” he sneered . ( Certainly , if the Furies were listening , they would put that down to his credit ! ) “
60382	60420	60380	60380	John	174	” she said ; then she locked the desk , took her hat from the lamp - chimney on which it had been hanging , jammed it down on her head like a helmet , and remarked : “
60439	60476	60432	60432	I	0	” On the way downstairs both were silent . Campton ’s ears echoed with his stupid taunt , and he glanced at her without daring to speak . On the last landing she paused and said : “
60507	60508	60520	60520	her	194	” “
60513	60517	60520	60520	her	194	” he assented . “
60531	60557	60520	60520	her	194	” It was as much of a message as he found courage for . Miss Anthony nodded . XIX One day Mme . Lebel said : “
60577	60937	60938	60938	I	0	” Campton looked at her in surprise . She spoke in a different voice ; he wondered if she had had good news of her grandchildren . Then he saw that the furrows in her old face were as deep as ever , and that the change in her voice was simply an unconscious response to the general stirring of sap , the spring need to go on living , through everything and in spite of everything . _ On se fait une raison _ , as Mme . Lebel would have said . Life had to go on , and new shirts had to be bought . No one knew why it was necessary , but every one felt that it was ; and here were the horse - chestnuts once more actively confirming it . Habit laid its compelling grasp on the wires of the poor broken marionettes with which the Furies had been playing , and they responded , though with feebler flappings , to the accustomed jerk . In Campton the stirring of the sap had been a cold and languid process , chiefly felt in his reluctance to go on with his relief work . He had tried to close his ears to the whispers of his own lassitude , vexed , after the first impulse of self - dedication , to find that no vocation declared itself , that his task became each day more tedious as well as more painful . Theoretically , the pain ought to have stimulated him : perpetual immersion in that sea of anguish should have quickened his effort to help the poor creatures sinking under its waves . The woe of the war had had that effect on Adele Anthony , on young Boylston , on Mlle . Davril , on the greater number of his friends . But their ardour left him cold . He wanted to help , he wanted it , he was sure , as earnestly as they ; but the longing was not an inspiration to him , and he felt more and more that to work listlessly was to work ineffectually . “
60963	60973	60961	60961	Boylston	247	” he complained to Miss Anthony ; who murmured : “
60981	60994	60976	60977	_ Boylston	247	” as if that point of the remark were alone worth noticing . “
61014	61015	61006	61007	the boy	416	” “
61045	61046	61032	61032	he	247	” “
61087	61088	61070	61070	He	247	” “
61117	61124	61125	61126	Benny Upsher	259	” Campton made an impatient movement . “
61154	61155	61156	61156	I	0	” “
61159	61389	61156	61156	I	0	” echoed Miss Anthony . Talks of this kind were irritating and unprofitable , and Campton did not again raise the question . Miss Anthony ’s vision was too simplifying to penetrate far into his doubts , and after nearly a year ’s incessant contact with the most savage realities her mind still seemed at ease in its old formulas . Simplicity , after all , was the best safeguard in such hours . Mrs. Brant was as absorbed in her task as Adele Anthony . Since the Brant villa at Deauville had been turned into a hospital she was always on the road , in a refulgent new motor emblazoned with a Red Cross , carrying supplies , rushing down with great surgeons , hurrying back to committee meetings and conferences with the Service de Santé ( for she and Mr. Brant were now among the leaders in American relief work in Paris ) , and throwing open the Avenue Marigny drawing - rooms for concerts , lectures and such sober philanthropic gaieties as society was beginning to countenance . On the day when Mme . Lebel told Campton that the horse - chestnuts were in blossom and he must buy some new shirts he was particularly in need of such incentives . He had made up his mind to go to see Mrs. Brant about a concert for “
61395	61772	61773	61773	Bridge	311	” which was to be held in her house . Ever since George had asked him to see something of his mother Campton had used the pretext of charitable collaboration as the best way of getting over their fundamental lack of anything to say to each other . The appearance of the Champs Elysées confirmed Mme . Lebel ’s announcement . Everywhere the punctual rosy spikes were rising above unfolding green ; and Campton , looking up at them , remembered once thinking how Nature had adapted herself to the scene in overhanging with her own pink lamps and green fans the lamps and fans of the _ cafés chantants _ beneath . The latter lights had long since been extinguished , the fans folded up ; and as he passed the bent and broken arches of electric light , the iron chairs and dead plants in paintless boxes , all heaped up like the scenery of a bankrupt theatre , he felt the pang of Nature ’s obstinate renewal in a world of death . Yet he also felt the stir of the blossoming trees in the form of a more restless discontent , a duller despair , a new sense of inadequacy . How could war go on when spring had come ? Mrs. Brant , having reduced her household and given over her drawing - rooms to charity , received in her boudoir , a small room contrived by a clever upholsterer to simulate a seclusion of which she had never felt the need . Photographs strewed the low tables ; and facing the door Campton saw George ’s last portrait , in uniform , enclosed in an expensive frame . Campton had received the same photograph , and thrust it into a drawer ; he thought a young man on a safe staff job rather ridiculous in uniform , and at the same time the sight filled him with a secret dread . Mrs. Brant was bidding goodbye to a lady in mourning whom Campton did not know . His approach through the carpeted antechamber had been unnoticed , and as he entered the room he heard Mrs. Brant say in French , apparently in reply to a remark of her visitor : “
61807	61808	61799	61800	We mothers	1813	” “
61811	61817	61799	61800	We mothers	1813	” exclaimed the other lady , “
61859	61872	61875	61875	I	0	” she added , lowering her voice but lifting her head higher , “
61888	61931	61879	61886	the one who is buried by the Marne	1817	” With a flush on her handsome face she pressed Mrs. Brant ’s hand and passed out . Mrs. Brant had caught sight of Campton as she received the rebuke . Her colour rose slightly , and she said with a smile : “
61942	61943	61879	61886	the one who is buried by the Marne	1817	” “
61946	61960	61879	61886	the one who is buried by the Marne	1817	” he agreed . There was a pause , and then he asked : “
61965	61966	61972	61973	the widow	1818	” “
61975	61976	61972	61973	the widow	1818	” “
61985	61986	61979	61983	the sons she spoke of	1819	” “
62038	62039	62032	62032	I	0	” “
62042	62046	62048	62048	you	0	” Campton interrupted , “
62068	62084	62059	62059	you	0	” Her silence and her deepening flush made him feel the unkindness of the question . “
62093	62097	62085	62085	I	0	” he said . “
62111	62112	62107	62107	I	0	” “
62115	62477	62107	62107	I	0	” she questioned . He was silent in his turn , and she did not insist . They sat facing each other , each forgetting the purpose of their meeting . For the hundredth time he felt the uselessness of trying to carry out George ’s filial injunction : between himself and George ’s mother these months of fiery trial seemed to have loosed instead of tightening the links . He wandered back to Montmartre through the bereft and beautiful city . The light lay on it in wide silvery washes , harmonizing the grey stone , the pale foliage , and a sky piled with clouds which seemed to rebuild in translucid masses the monuments below . He caught himself once more viewing the details of the scene in the terms of his trade . River , pavements , terraces heavy with trees , the whole crowded sky - line from Notre Dame to the Panthéon , instead of presenting themselves in their bare reality , were transposed into a painter ’s vision . And the faces around him became again the starting - point of rapid incessant combinations of line and colour , as if the visible world were once more at its old trick of weaving itself into magic designs . The reawakening of this instinct deepened Campton ’s sense of unrest , and made him feel more than ever unfitted for a life in which such things were no longer of account , in which it seemed a disloyalty even to think of them . He returned to the studio , having promised to deal with some office work which he had carried home the night before . The papers lay on the table ; but he turned to the window and looked out over his budding lilacs at the new strange Paris . He remembered that it was almost a year since he had leaned in the same place , gazing down on the wise and frivolous old city in her summer dishabille while he planned his journey to Africa with George ; and something George had once quoted from Faust came drifting through his mind : “
62493	62602	62604	62604	I	0	” Ah , yes , splinters , splinters ... everybody ’s hands were red with them ! What retribution devised by man could be commensurate with the crime of destroying his beautiful world ? Campton sat down to the task of collating office files . His bell rang , and he started up , as much surprised as if the simplest events had become unusual . It would be natural enough that Dastrey or Boylston should drop in — or even Adele Anthony — but his heart beat as if it might be George . He limped to the door , and found Mrs. Talkett . She said : “
62608	62736	62604	62604	I	0	” and did so without waiting for his answer . The rapidity of her entrance surprised him less than the change in her appearance . But for the one glimpse of her dishevelled elegance , when she had rushed into Mrs. Brant ’s drawing - room on the day after war was declared , he had seen her only in a nursing uniform , as absorbed in her work as if it had been a long - thwarted vocation . Now she stood before him in raiment so delicately springlike that it seemed an emanation of the day . Care had dropped from her with her professional garb , and she smiled as though he must guess the reason . In ordinary times he would have thought : “
62743	62794	62795	62796	the Talketts	315	” but that explanation was one which seemed to belong to other days . It reminded him , however , how little he knew of Mrs. Talkett , who , after René Davril ’s death , had vanished from his life as abruptly as she had entered it . Allusions to “
62798	62835	62795	62796	the Talketts	315	” picked up now and again at Adele Anthony ’s , led him to conjecture an invisible husband in the background ; but all he knew of Mrs. Talkett was what she had told him of her “
62837	62951	62795	62796	the Talketts	315	” yearnings , and what he had been able to divine from her empty questioning eyes , from certain sweet inflections when she spoke of her wounded soldiers , and from the precise and finished language with which she clothed her unfinished and imprecise thoughts . All these indications made up an image not unlike that of the fashion - plate torn from its context of which she had reminded him at their first meeting ; and he looked at her with indifference , wondering why she had come . With an abrupt gesture she pulled the pin from her heavily - plumed hat , tossed it on the divan , and said : “
62969	63005	62964	62964	you	3279	” She dropped down beside her hat , clasped her thin hands about her thin knee , and broke out , as if she had already forgotten that she wanted him to talk to her : “
63190	63205	63188	63188	I	0	” she paused , unclasped her hands , and lifted her lovely bewildered eyes , “
63310	63319	63488	63488	I	0	” She drew a deep breath and added : “
63334	63368	63488	63488	I	0	” Campton , a few weeks previously , would have been amused , or perhaps merely irritated . But in the interval he had become aware in himself of the same irresistible craving to “
63371	63442	63488	63488	I	0	” as she put it , and as he had heard it formulated , that very day , by the mourning mother who had so sharply rebuked Mrs. Brant . The spring was stirring them all in their different ways , secreting in them the sap which craved to burst into bridge - parties , or the painting of masterpieces , or a consciousness of the need for new shirts . “
63451	63465	63446	63446	I	0	” Mrs. Talkett rushed on , sparing him the trouble of a reply . “
63582	63589	63568	63568	Master	1843	” Campton gave an uneasy laugh . “
63594	63604	63568	63568	Master	1843	” He waved his hand toward the office files of “
63611	63612	63568	63568	Master	1843	” “
63618	63619	63623	63623	you	1830	” “
63672	63673	63674	63674	I	0	” “
63680	63684	63674	63674	I	0	” Campton growled . “
63690	63697	63698	63698	You	0	” She looked at him profoundly . “
63730	63900	63719	63719	he	924	” For months past any allusion to George had put Campton on his guard , stiffening him with improvised defences . But this appeal of Mrs. Talkett ’s found him unprepared , demoralized by the spring sweetness , and by his secret sense of his son ’s connivance with it . What was war — any war — but an old European disease , an ancestral blood - madness seizing on the first pretext to slake its frenzy ? Campton reminded himself again that he was the son of free institutions , of a country in no way responsible for the centuries of sinister diplomacy which had brought Europe to ruin , and was now trying to drag down America . George was right , the Brants were right , this young woman through whose lips Campton ’s own secret instinct spoke was right . He was silent so long that she rose with the anxious frown that appeared to be her way of blushing , and faltered out : “
63910	63928	63906	63906	I’d	0	” She picked up her hat and held its cataract of feathers poised above her slanted head . “
63938	63981	63982	63982	Me	0	” Campton cried . It had never before occurred to him that she was paintable ; but as she stood there with uplifted arm the long line flowing from her wrist to her hip suddenly wound itself about him like a net . “
63984	64001	63982	63982	Me	0	” she stammered , standing motionless , as if frightened by the excess of her triumph . “
64006	64017	64003	64003	you	0	” he queried ; and hardly hearing her faltered out : “
64028	64477	64479	64479	herself	1855	” he dragged forth an easel , flung on it the first canvas he could lay hands on ( though he knew it was the wrong shape and size ) , and found himself instantly transported into the lost world which was the only real one . XX For a month Campton painted on in transcendent bliss . His first stroke carried him out of space and time , into a region where all that had become numbed and atrophied in him could expand and breathe . Lines , images , colours were again the sole facts : he plunged into their whirling circles like a stranded sea - creature into the sea . Once more every face was not a vague hieroglyph , a curtain drawn before an invisible aggregate of wants and woes , but a work of art , a flower in a pattern , to be dealt with on its own merits , like a bronze or a jewel . During the first day or two his hand halted ; but the sense of insufficiency was a goad , and he fought with his subject till he felt a strange ease in every renovated muscle , and his model became like a musical instrument on which he played with careless mastery . He had transferred his easel to Mrs. Talkett ’s apartment . It was an odd patchwork place , full of bold beginnings and doubtful pauses , rash surrenders to the newest fashions and abrupt insurrections against them , where Louis Philippe mahogany had entrenched itself against the aggression of _ art nouveau _ hangings , and the frail grace of eighteenth - century armchairs shed derision on lumpy modern furniture painted like hobby - horses at a fair . It amused Campton to do Mrs. Talkett against such a background : her thin personality needed to be filled out by the visible results of its many quests and cravings . There were people one could sit down before a blank wall , and all their world was there , in the curves of their faces and the way their hands lay in their laps ; others , like Mrs. Talkett , seemed to be made out of the reflection of what surrounded them , as if they had been born of a tricky grouping of looking - glasses , and would vanish if it were changed . At first Campton was steeped in the mere sensual joy of his art ; but after a few days the play of the mirrors began to interest him . Mrs. Talkett had abandoned her hospital work , and was trying , as she said , to “
64481	64686	64479	64479	herself	1855	” In this she was aided by a number of people who struck Campton as rather too young not to have found some other job , or too old to care any longer for that particular one . But all this did not trouble his newly recovered serenity . He seemed to himself , somehow , like a drowned body — but drowned in a toy aquarium — still staring about with living eyes , but aware of the other people only as shapes swimming by with a flash of exotic fins . They were enclosed together , all of them , in an unreal luminous sphere , mercifully screened against the reality from which a common impulse of horror had driven them ; and since he was among them it was not his business to wonder at the others . So , through the cloud of his art , he looked out on them impartially . The high priestess of the group was Mme . de Dolmetsch , with Harvey Mayhew as her acolyte . Mr. Mayhew was still in pursuit of Atrocities : he was in fact almost the only member of the group who did not rather ostentatiously disavow the obligation to “
64690	64722	64723	64723	his	1856	” But he had discovered that to discharge this sacred task he must vary it by frequent intervals of relaxation . He explained to Campton that he had found it to be “
64727	64819	64820	64820	You	1857	” ; and he was indefatigable in the performance of duty . He had therefore , with an expenditure of eloquence which Campton thought surprisingly slight , persuaded Boylston to become his understudy , and devote several hours a day to the whirling activities of the shrimp - pink Bureau of Atrocities at the Nouveau Luxe . Campton , at first , could not understand how the astute Boylston had allowed himself to be drawn into the eddy ; but it turned out that Boylston ’s astuteness had drawn him in . “
64860	64995	64857	64857	I	0	” the young man modestly explained ; adding , in response to the painter ’s puzzled stare , that Mr. Mayhew ’s harrowing appeals were beginning to bring from America immense sums for the Victims , and that Mr. Mayhew , while immensely gratified by the effect of his eloquence , and the prestige it was bringing him in French social and governmental circles , had not the cloudiest notion how the funds should be used , and had begged Boylston to advise him . It was owing to this that the ex - Delegate to the Hague was able , with a light conscience , to seek the repose of Mrs. Talkett ’s company and , with a smile of the widest initiation , to listen to the subversive conversation of her familiars . “
64997	65081	64854	64855	Miss Anthony	221	” was the motto of the group . Every one was engaged in attacking some theory of art or life or letters which nobody in particular defended . Even Mr. Talkett — a kindly young man with eye - glasses and glossy hair , who roamed about straightening the furniture , like a gentlemanly detective watching the presents at a wedding — owned to Campton that _ he _ was subversive ; and on the painter ’s pressing for a definition , added : “
65098	65306	65091	65091	she	1858	” while his eye - glasses shyly followed his wife ’s course among the teacups . Mme . de Dolmetsch , though obviously anxious to retain her hold on Mr. Mayhew , did not restrict herself to such mild fare , but exercised her matchless eyes on a troop of followers : the shock - haired pianist who accompanied her recitations , a straight - backed young American diplomatist whose collars seemed a part of his career , a lustrous South American millionaire , and a short squat Sicilian who designed the costumes for the pianist ’s unproduced ballets . All these people appeared to believe intensely in each other ’s reality and importance ; but it gradually came over Campton that all of them , excepting their host and hostess , knew that they were merely masquerading . To Campton , used to the hard - working world of art , this playing at Bohemia seemed a nursery - game ; but the scene acquired an unexpected solidity from the appearance in it , one day , of the banker Jorgenstein , who strolled in as naturally as if he had been dropping into Campton ’s studio to enquire into the progress of his own portrait . “
65323	65362	65307	65307	I	0	” he said jovially , tapping his fat boot with a malacca stick as he looked over the painter ’s head at the canvas on which Mrs. Talkett ’s restless image seemed to flutter like a butterfly impaled . “
65376	65403	65374	65374	you	1859	” the sitter declared , smiling back at the leer which Campton divined behind his shoulder ; and he felt a sudden pity for her innocence . “
65422	65449	65416	65416	his	174	” said Mr. Talkett , straightening a curtain and disappearing again , like a diving animal ; and Mrs. Talkett turned her plaintive eyes on Campton . “
65461	65475	65456	65456	I	0	” they seemed to say ; and he nearly cried back to her : “
65492	65599	65600	65600	You	1861	” Absorbed in his picture , he hardly stopped to wonder at Jorgenstein ’s reappearance , at his air of bloated satisfaction or his easy allusions to Cabinet Ministers and eminent statesmen . The atmosphere of the Talkett house was so mirage - like that even the big red bulk of the international financier became imponderable in it . But one day Campton , on his way home , ran across Dastrey , and remembered that they had not met for weeks . The ministerial drudge looked worn and preoccupied , and Campton was abruptly recalled to the world he had been trying to escape from . “
65613	65617	65600	65600	You	1861	” Dastrey stared . “
65632	65633	65625	65625	you	1861	” “
65640	65654	65634	65634	I	0	” said Campton curtly . They walked along a few steps in silence . “
65658	65663	65655	65655	You	1862	” the painter continued , “
65682	65691	65675	65675	I	0	” Dastrey glanced at him with surprising kindliness . “
65703	65704	65705	65705	You	1861	” “
65709	65715	65705	65705	You	1861	” Campton half - sneered . “
65733	65734	65728	65728	I	0	” “
65737	65741	65728	65728	I	0	” Campton paused . “
65783	65784	65786	65786	her	255	” “
65789	65796	65786	65786	her	255	” Dastrey paused with a frown . “
65803	65804	65786	65786	her	255	” “
65842	65862	65839	65839	you	0	” He shot out the sentences like challenges ; and his friend took them up in the same tone . “
65883	65884	65874	65874	I’m	0	” “
65896	65901	65891	65891	You	0	” said Campton quarrelsomely . “
66016	66017	65970	65970	they	1868	” “
66021	66022	65970	65970	they	1868	” “
66033	66054	65970	65970	they	1868	” Campton shouted , bringing his stick down with a whack on the pavement . Dastrey broke into a laugh . “
66214	66225	66202	66202	you	0	” He held out his hand with a dry smile . “
66242	66573	66233	66234	my nephew	1879	” He hastened away , leaving Campton in a crumbled world . Louis Dastrey on leave ? But that was because he was at the front , the real front , in the trenches , had already had a slight wound and a fine citation . Staff - officers , as George had wisely felt , were not asking for leave just yet .... The thoughts excited by this encounter left Campton more than ever resolved to drug himself with work and frivolity . It was none of his business to pry into the consciences of the people about him , not even into Jorgenstein’s — into which one would presumably have had to be let down in a diver ’s suit , with oxygen pumping at top pressure . If the government tolerated Jorgenstein ’s presence in France , probably on the ground that he could be useful — so the banker himself let it be known — it was silly of people like Adele Anthony and Dastrey to wince at the mere mention of his name . There woke in Campton all the old spirit of aimless random defiance — revolt for revolt ’s sake — which had marked the first period of his life after his separation from his wife . He had long since come to regard it as a crude and juvenile phase — yet here he was reliving it . Though he knew of the intimacy between Mrs. Talkett and the Brants he had no fear of meeting Julia : it was impossible to picture her neat head battling with the blasts of that dishevelled drawing - room . But though she did not appear there , he heard her more and more often alluded to , in terms of startling familiarity , by Mrs. Talkett ’s visitors . It was clear that they all saw her , chiefly in her own house , that they thought her , according to their respective vocabularies , “
66578	66579	66574	66585	a perfect dear , ” “ _ une femme exquise _ ”	3739	” “
66585	66587	66574	66585	a perfect dear , ” “ _ une femme exquise _ ”	3739	” or “
66593	66630	66574	66585	a perfect dear , ” “ _ une femme exquise _ ”	3739	” ( ah , poor Julia ! ) ; and that their sudden enthusiasm for her was not uninspired by the fact that she had got her marvellous _ chef _ demobilised , and was giving little “
66634	66686	66690	66690	she	1880	” followed by a quiet turn at bridge . Campton remembered Mme . de Tranlay ’s rebuke to Mrs. Brant on the day when he had last called in the Avenue Marigny ; then he remembered also that it was on that very day that he had returned to his painting . “
66701	66852	66699	66699	Julia	194	” he mused , annoyed at the idea of her being the complacent victim of all the voracities he saw about him , and yet reflecting that she was at last living her life , as they called it at Mrs. Talkett ’s . After all , the fact that George was not at the front seemed to exonerate his parents — unless , indeed , it did just the opposite . One day , coming earlier than usual to Mrs. Talkett ’s to put in a last afternoon ’s work on her portrait , Campton , to his surprise , found his wife in front of it . Equally to his surprise he noticed that she was dressed with a juvenility quite new to her ; and for the first time he thought she looked old - fashioned and also old . She met him with her usual embarrassment . “
66874	66883	66864	66864	Madge	282	” She waved her hand toward the portrait . “
66890	66901	66884	66884	I	0	” he said , suddenly finding that he did n’t . “
66908	66915	66884	66884	I	0	” She looked at him timidly . “
66932	66956	66921	66921	you	1881	” she ventured in the jargon of the place . Campton , to hide a smile , turned away to get his brushes . “
66962	66967	66957	66957	I	0	” she continued hastily , “
66983	66984	66988	66988	you	0	” “
66995	67040	67043	67043	she	1882	” he rejoined with a scornful laugh . She evidently caught the allusion , for she blushed all over her uncovered neck , up through the faintly wrinkled cheeks to the roots of her newly dyed hair ; then he saw her eyes fill . “
67056	67293	67294	67294	George	175	” he wondered , busying himself with his palette . Mrs. Talkett hurried in with surprise and apologies ; and one by one the habitués followed , with cheery greetings for Mrs. Brant and a moment of constraint as they noted Campton ’s presence , and the relation between the two was mutely passed about . Then the bridge - tables were brought , Mr. Talkett began to straighten the cards nervously , and the guests broke up into groups , forgetting everything but their own affairs . As Campton turned back to his work he was aware of a last surprise in the sight of Mrs. Brant serene and almost sparkling , waving her adieux to the bridge - tables , and going out followed by Jorgenstein , with whom she seemed on terms of playful friendliness . Of all strange war promiscuities , Campton thought this the strangest . XXI The next time Campton saw Mrs. Brant was in his own studio . He was preparing , one morning , to leave the melancholy place , when the bell rang and his _ bonne _ let her in . Her dress was less frivolous than at Mrs. Talkett ’s , and she wore a densely patterned veil , like the ladies in cinema plays when they visit their seducers or their accomplices . Through the veil she looked at him agitatedly , and said : “
67301	67305	67294	67294	George	175	” He stared . “
67316	67317	67318	67318	Brant	196	” “
67324	67432	67318	67318	Brant	196	” Campton felt the blood rush to his temples . What ! He , the boy ’s father , had not so much as dared to ask for the almost unattainable permission to go into the war - zone ; and this other man , who was nothing to George , absolutely nothing , who had no right whatever to ask for leave to visit him , had somehow obtained the priceless favour , and instead of passing it on , instead of offering at least to share it with the boy ’s father , had sneaked off secretly to feast on the other ’s lawful privilege ! “
67439	67444	67434	67435	the devil	1885	” Campton burst out . “
67464	67465	67461	67462	a friend	1493	” “
67470	67492	67495	67495	he	1885	” Campton stammered , sitting down lest his legs should fail him , and signing to her to take a chair . “
67500	67505	67515	67515	he	1885	” she repeated excitedly . “
67521	67522	67515	67515	he	1885	” “
67530	67547	67548	67548	Anderson	196	” Campton interrupted , the ferocious joy of the discovery crowding out his wrath and wonder . “
67563	67564	67554	67554	He	1885	” “
67571	67572	67554	67554	He	1885	” “
67596	67597	67586	67586	He	1885	” “
67602	67603	67607	67607	they	1892	” “
67616	67617	67610	67610	I	0	” “
67623	67624	67620	67620	you	0	” “
67661	67754	67651	67651	he	1885	” Campton sat looking at her uncertainly . Did she dread , or did she rather wish , to disbelieve the officer ’s statement ? Where did she hope or fear that George had gone ? And what were Campton ’s own emotions ? As confused , no doubt , as hers — as undefinable . The insecurity of his feelings moved him to a momentary compassion for hers , which were surely pitiable , whatever else they were . Then a savage impulse swept away every other , and he said : “
67769	67774	67759	67759	Brant	196	” She grew pale . “
67780	67781	67777	67777	you	1895	” “
67801	67810	67796	67796	he	3455	” Campton went on , prolonging her distress . “
67818	67825	67815	67815	you	1895	” she pleaded with frightened eyes . “
67951	67952	67923	67923	she	1901	” “
67965	67983	67986	67986	I	0	” She held her hands before her face as if he had flung something flaming at her . “
67992	67993	67986	67986	I	0	” “
68006	68016	68017	68017	You	0	” he pursued sardonically . Her answer disarmed him . “
68022	68023	68017	68017	You	0	” “
68029	68035	68024	68024	I	0	” he went on hastily , “
68062	68068	68052	68052	I	0	” She hung her head . “
68110	68131	68101	68101	Anderson	196	” He made no answer , and she sat silent , without apparent thought of leaving . Finally he said : “
68139	68144	68132	68132	I	0	” She stood up . “
68163	68164	68153	68153	I	0	” “
68170	68171	68172	68173	The motor	1081	” “
68180	68189	68172	68173	The motor	1081	” She laid her hand on his arm . “
68246	68255	68256	68256	She	323	” she burst out passionately . Campton smiled . “
68268	68269	68261	68261	George	175	” “
68285	68291	68292	68292	My	0	” He disengaged himself gently . “
68306	68307	68294	68294	Julia	194	” “
68350	68361	68337	68337	Olida	323	” she added hastily , as if conscious of the inopportune “
68364	68372	68337	68337	Olida	323	” After a moment she went on : “
68478	68525	68474	68474	You	1920	” she insisted . Campton was seized with a sudden deep compassion for all these women groping for a ray of light in the blackness . It moved him to think of Mme . de Tranlay ’s proud figure climbing a _ clairvoyante ’s _ stairs . “
68535	68565	68530	68530	you	1921	” he said . They drove to the Batignolles quarter . Mrs. Brant ’s lips were twitching under her veil , and as the motor stopped she said childishly : “
68577	68578	68579	68579	I	0	” “
68584	68662	68530	68530	you	1921	” Campton rejoined . He himself , during the Russian lady ’s rule , had served an apprenticeship among the soothsayers , and come away disgusted with the hours wasted in their company . He suddenly remembered the Spanish girl in the little white house near the railway , who had told his fortune in the hot afternoons with cards and olive - stones , and had found , by irrefutable signs , that he and she would “
68665	68668	68694	68694	she	1923	” again . “
68681	68685	68694	68694	she	1923	” he mused , “
68702	68914	68697	68697	she	1923	” Mrs. Brant rang , and Campton followed her into a narrow hall . A servant - woman showed them into a _ salon _ which was as commonplace as a doctor ’s waiting - room . On the mantelpiece were vases of Pampas grass , and a stuffed monkey swung from the electrolier . Evidently Mme . Olida was superior to the class of fortune - tellers who prepare a special stage - setting , and no astrologer ’s robe or witch ’s kitchen was to be feared . The maid led them across a plain dining - room into an inner room . The shutters were partly closed , and the blinds down . A voluminous woman in loose black rose from a sofa . Gold earrings gleamed under her oiled black hair — and suddenly , through the billows of flesh , and behind the large pale mask , Campton recognized the Spanish girl who used to read his fortune in the house by the railway . Her eyes rested a moment on Mrs. Brant ; then they met his with the same heavy stare . But he noticed that her hands , which were small and fat , trembled a little as she pointed to two chairs . “
68920	68956	68697	68697	she	1923	” she said in a low rough voice , speaking in French . The door opened again , and a young man with Levantine eyes and a showy necktie looked in . She said sharply : “
68959	68995	68697	68697	she	1923	” and he disappeared . Campton noticed that a large emerald flashed on his manicured hand . Mme . Olida continued to look at her visitors . Mrs. Brant wiped her dry lips and stammered : “
69007	69047	69048	69048	You	1924	” Mme . Olida fell back in a trance - like attitude , let her lips droop over her magnificent eyes , and rested her head against a soiled sofa - pillow . Presently she held out both hands . “
69063	69122	69123	69123	You	1924	” As her cushioned palm touched Campton ’s he thought he felt a tremor of recognition , and saw , in the half - light , the tremor communicate itself to her lids . He grasped her hand firmly , and she lifted her eyes , looked straight into his with her heavy velvety stare , and said : “
69138	69310	69123	69123	You	1924	” She turned her palm upward , so that his finger - tips rested on it as if on a keyboard ; he noticed that she did not do the same with the hand she had placed in Mrs. Brant ’s . Suddenly he remembered that one sultry noon , lying under the olives , she had taught him , by signals tapped on his own knee , how to say what he chose to her without her brothers ’ knowing it . He looked at the huge woman , seeking the curve of the bowed upper lip on which what used to be a faint blue shadow had now become a line as thick as her eyebrows , and recalling how her laugh used to lift the lip above her little round teeth while she threw back her head , showing the Agnus Dei in her neck . Now her mouth was like a withered flower , and in a crease of her neck a string of pearls was embedded . “
69316	69335	69123	69123	You	1924	” she commanded . Julia gave Campton her ungloved hand , and he sat between the two women . “
69354	69363	69341	69341	You	1929	” Mme . Olida closed her eyes again . “
69378	69457	69458	69458	I	0	” Mrs. Brant whispered . Mme . Olida sat as if labouring with difficult visions . The noises of the street came faintly through the closed windows and a smell of garlic and cheap scent oppressed Campton ’s lungs and awakened old associations . With a final effort of memory he fixed his eyes on the _ clairvoyante ’s _ darkened mask , and tapped her palm once or twice . She neither stirred nor looked at him . “
69465	69473	69461	69461	I	0	” she began in the consecrated phrase . “
69518	69528	69461	69461	I	0	” Mrs. Brant ’s hand trembled in Campton ’s . “
69533	69537	69461	69461	I	0	” she whispered , “
69553	69554	69461	69461	I	0	” “
69763	69764	69758	69759	your son	924	” “
69767	69772	69758	69759	your son	924	” gasped Mrs. Brant . “
69783	69850	69778	69778	you	1933	” Mme . Olida reminded her . There was another interval ; Campton felt his wife ’s fingers beating between his like trapped birds . The heat and darkness oppressed him ; beads of sweat came out on his forehead . Did the woman really see things , and was that face with the blood on it Benny Upsher ’s ? Mme . Olida droned on . “
69915	69926	69930	69930	Madame	1948	” She released Mrs. Brant ’s hand and Campton ’s . “
69946	69989	69937	69937	his	924	” Mrs. Brant stood up sobbing . She found her gold bag and pushed it toward Campton . He had been feeling in his own pocket for money ; but as he drew it forth Mme . Olida put back his hand . “
70033	70052	70017	70017	I	0	” Campton put Julia into the motor . She was still crying , but her tears were radiant . “
70099	70100	70108	70108	him	175	” “
70113	70280	70108	70108	him	175	” Campton said . He was touched by her maternal passion , and ashamed of having allowed her so small a share in his jealous worship of his son . He walked away , thinking of the young man dying in a German hospital , and of the other man ’s face succeeding his on the pillow . XXII Two days later , to Campton ’s surprise , Anderson Brant appeared in the morning at the studio . Campton , finishing a late breakfast in careless studio - garb , saw his visitor peer cautiously about , as though fearing undressed models behind the screens or empty beer - bottles under the tables . It was the first time that Mr. Brant had entered the studio since his attempt to buy George ’s portrait , and Campton guessed at once that he had come again about George . He looked at the painter shyly , as if oppressed by the indiscretion of intruding at that hour . “
70296	70374	70291	70291	she	196	” he brought out between precautionary coughs . Campton looked at him tolerantly : a barrier seemed to have fallen between them since their brief exchange of words about Benny Upsher . The letter , as Campton had expected , was a line from George to his mother , written two days after Mr. Brant ’s visit to Sainte Menehould . It expressed , in George ’s usual staccato style , his regret at having been away . “
70409	70442	70404	70405	Uncle Andy	229	” It was always the same tone of fluent banter , in which Campton fancied he detected a lurking stridency , like the scrape of an overworked gramophone containing only comic disks . “
70453	70463	70447	70448	his mother	583	” Campton said as he gave the letter back . “
70516	70522	70511	70511	her	583	” Campton looked at him . “
70529	70564	70524	70524	yourself	0	” Mr. Brant , who had half risen , as though feeling that his errand was done , slid back into his seat and clasped his small hands on his agate - headed stick . “
70569	70570	70524	70524	yourself	0	” “
70575	70579	70524	70524	yourself	0	” Campton pursued , “
70590	70599	70587	70588	Sainte Menehould	306	” Mr. Brant glanced at him in surprise . “
70607	70608	70620	70621	his mother	583	” “
70613	70614	70615	70615	I	0	” “
70660	70662	70663	70663	we	1960	” The “
70665	70681	70663	70663	we	1960	” pulling him up short , spread a brick - red blush over his baldness . “
70697	70745	70691	70691	I	0	” Campton retorted , the sneer breaking out in spite of him . Though he had grown kindly disposed toward Mr. Brant when they were apart , the old resentments still broke out in his presence . Mr. Brant clasped and unclasped the knob of his stick . “
70762	70772	70773	70773	I	0	” Campton made no answer , and he continued : “
70786	70787	70778	70778	you	0	” “
70795	70799	70778	70778	you	0	” Campton retorted . “
70820	70846	70815	70815	you	0	” Mr. Brant was silent . He seemed overwhelmed by the other ’s disapprobation , and unable to find any argument in his own defence . “
70856	70862	70847	70847	I	0	” he said at length . “
70878	70902	70903	70903	I	0	” Campton had risen , pushing back his chair , and Mr. Brant stood up also . They faced each other without speaking . “
70907	70912	70903	70903	I	0	” Mr. Brant began , “
70937	70938	70929	70930	Mr. Jorgenstein	325	” “
70958	70967	70943	70943	Jorgenstein	325	” Campton threw his head back and laughed . “
70977	71128	71129	71129	I	0	” Mr. Brant reddened as if the laugh had been a blow . He stood very erect , his lips as tightly closed as a shut penknife . He had the attitude of a civilian under fire , considerably perturbed , but obliged to set the example of fortitude . Campton looked at him . At last he had Mr. Brant at a disadvantage . Their respective situations were reversed , and he saw that the banker was aware of it , and oppressed by the fear that he might have done harm to George . He evidently wanted to say all this and did not know how . His distress moved Campton , in whose ears the sound of his own outburst still echoed unpleasantly . If only Mr. Brant would have kept out of his way he would have found it so easy to be fair to him ! “
71133	71141	71129	71129	I	0	” he began in a quieter tone . “
71222	71236	71238	71238	you	1966	” His excitement was mastering him again , and he went on hurriedly : “
71320	71381	71382	71382	They	1973	” The futility of this retrospect , and the inconsistency of his whole attitude , exasperated Campton more than anything his visitor could do or say , and he stopped , embarrassed by the sound of his own words , yet seeing no escape save to bury them under more and more . But Mr. Brant had opened his lips . “
71395	71424	71425	71425	You	1966	” he said . Campton ’s anger dropped : he felt Mr. Brant at last too completely at his mercy . He waited for a moment before speaking . “
71444	71484	71435	71435	I	0	” he then said . Mr. Brant stood motionless , grasping his stick in one hand and stroking his moustache with the other . For a while he seemed to be considering Campton ’s words without feeling their sting . “
71491	71512	71513	71513	I	0	” he stammered out at length , from the depth of some unutterable plea for understanding ; then he added : “
71520	71679	71513	71513	I	0	” and walked out with his little stiff steps . XXIII Campton was thoroughly ashamed of what he had said to Mr. Brant , or rather of his manner of saying it . If he could have put the same facts quietly , ironically , without forfeiting his dignity , and with the added emphasis which deliberateness and composure give , he would scarcely have regretted the opportunity . He had always secretly accused himself of a lack of courage in accepting Mr. Brant ’s heavy benefactions for George when the boy was too young to know what they might pledge him to ; and it had been a disappointment that George , on reaching the age of discrimination , had not appeared to find the burden heavy , or the obligations unpleasant . Campton , having accepted Mr. Brant ’s help , could hardly reproach his son for feeling grateful for it , and had therefore thought it “
71682	71920	71513	71513	I	0	” to postpone disparagement of their common benefactor till his own efforts had set them both free . Even then , it would be impossible to pay off the past — but the past might have been left to bury itself . Now his own wrath had dug it up , and he had paid for the brief joy of casting its bones in Mr. Brant ’s face by a deep disgust at his own weakness . All these things would have weighed on him even more if the outer weight of events had not been so much heavier . He had not returned to Mrs. Talkett ’s since the banker ’s visit ; he did not wish to meet Jorgenstein , and his talk with the banker , and his visit to the _ clairvoyante _ , had somehow combined to send that whole factitious world tumbling about his ears . It was absurd to attach any importance to poor Olida ’s vaticinations ; but the vividness of her description of the baby - faced boy dying in a German hospital haunted Campton ’s nights . If it were not the portrait of Benny Upsher it was at least that of hundreds and thousands of lads like him , who were thus groping and agonizing and stretching out vain hands , while in Mrs. Talkett ’s drawing - room well - fed men and expensive women heroically “
71925	71980	71513	71513	I	0	” Campton , seeking to expiate his own brief forgetfulness by a passion of renewed activity , announced to Boylston the next afternoon that he was coming back to the office . Boylston hardly responded : he looked up from his desk with a face so strange that Campton broke off to cry out : “
71985	71994	71513	71513	I	0	” The young man held out a newspaper . “
72004	72042	71995	71995	They	1974	” he shouted . Across the page the name of the _ Lusitania _ blazed out like the writing on the wall . The Berserker light on Boylston ’s placid features transformed him into an avenging cherub . “
72057	72105	72051	72051	we’re	1975	” he exulted , as if the horror of the catastrophe were already swallowed up in its result . The two looked at each other without further words ; but the older man ’s first thought had been for his son . Now , indeed , America was “
72108	72187	71995	71995	They	1974	” : the gross tangible proof for which her government had forced her to wait was there in all its unimagined horror . Ca nt and cowardice in high places had drugged and stupefied her into the strange belief that she was too proud to fight for others ; and here she was brutally forced to fight for herself . Campton waited with a straining heart for his son ’s first comment on the new fact that they were “
72191	72520	71995	71995	They	1974	” But his excitement and Boylston ’s exultation were short - lived . Before many days it became apparent that the proud nation which had flamed up overnight at the unproved outrage of the _ Maine _ was lying supine under the flagrant provocation of the _ Lusitania _ . The days which followed were , to many Americans , the bitterest of the war : to Campton they seemed the ironic justification of the phase of indifference and self - absorption through which he had just passed . He could not go back to Mrs. Talkett and her group ; but neither could he take up his work with even his former zeal . The bitter taste of the national humiliation was perpetually on his lips : he went about like a man dishonoured . He wondered , as the days and the weeks passed , at having no word from George . Had he refrained from writing because he too felt the national humiliation too deeply either to speak of it or to leave it unmentioned ? Or was he so sunk in security that he felt only a mean thankfulness that nothing was changed ? From such thoughts Campton ’s soul recoiled ; but they lay close under the surface of his tenderness , and reared their evil heads whenever they caught him alone . As the summer dragged itself out he was more and more alone . Dastrey , cured of his rheumatism , had left the Ministry to resume his ambulance work . Miss Anthony was submerged under the ever - mounting tide of refugees . Mrs. Brant had taken a small house at Deauville ( on the pretext of being near her hospital ) , and Campton heard of the Talketts ’ being with her , and others of their set . Mr. Mayhew appeared at the studio one day , in tennis flannels and a new straw hat , announcing that he “
72524	72536	72862	72862	his	1978	” and rather sheepishly adding that Mrs. Brant had suggested his spending “
72540	72544	72545	72545	I	0	” with her . “
72563	72600	72601	72605	the celebrated _ artiste _	1976	” Mr. Mayhew added in a stern voice , as if commanding himself not to waver . A few days later , glancing over the _ Herald _ , Campton read that Mme . de Dolmetsch , “
72607	72831	72601	72605	the celebrated _ artiste _	1976	” was staying with Mr. and Mrs. Anderson Brant at Deauville , where she had gone to give recitations for the wounded in hospital . Campton smiled , and then thought with a tightening heart of Benny Upsher and Ladislas Isador , so incredibly unlike in their lives , so strangely one in their death . Finally , not long afterward , he read that the celebrated financier , Sir Cyril Jorgenstein ( recently knighted by the British Government ) had bestowed a gift of a hundred thousand francs upon Mrs. Brant ’s hospital . It was rumoured , the paragraph ended , that Sir Cyril would soon receive the Legion of Honour for his magnificent liberalities to France . And still the flood of war rolled on . Success here , failure there , the menace of disaster elsewhere — Russia retreating to the San , Italy declaring war on Austria and preparing to cross the Isonzo , the British advance at Anzac , and from the near East news of the new landing at Suvla . Through all this alternating of tragedy and triumph ran the million and million individual threads of hope , fear , fortitude , resolve , with which the fortune of the war was obscurely but fatally interwoven . Campton remembered his sneer at Dastrey ’s phrase : “
72840	72860	72862	72862	his	1978	” He had begun to feel the force of that , to understand the need of every human being ’s “
72864	72970	72862	72862	his	1978	” in the struggle , had begun to scan every face in the street in the passionate effort to distinguish between the stones in the wall of resistance and the cracks through which discouragement might filter . The shabby office of the Palais Royal again became his only haven . His portrait of Mrs. Talkett had brought him many new orders ; but he refused them all , and declined even to finish the pictures interrupted by the war . One of his abrupt revulsions of feeling had flung him back , heart and brain , into the horror he had tried to escape from . “
72994	73033	72990	72990	I	0	” the war said to him ; and as the daily head - lines shrieked out the names of new battle - fields , from the Arctic shore to the Pacific , he groaned back like the Psalmist : “
73041	73218	73039	73039	thee	1979	” The people about him — Miss Anthony , Boylston , Mlle . Davril , and all their band of tired resolute workers — plodded ahead , their eyes on their task , seeming to find in its fulfillment a partial escape from the intolerable oppression . The women especially , with their gift of living in the particular , appeared hardly aware of the appalling development of the catastrophe ; and Campton felt himself almost as lonely among these people who thought of nothing but the war as among those who hardly thought of it at all . It was only when he and Boylston , after a hard morning ’s work , went out to lunch together , that what he called the _ Lusitania look _ , suddenly darkening the younger man ’s face , moved the painter with an anguish like his own . Boylston , breaking through his habitual shyness , had one day remonstrated with Campton for not going on with his painting : but the latter had merely rejoined : “
73235	73310	73231	73231	our	1981	” and the subject was not again raised between them . The intervals between George ’s letters were growing longer . Campton , who noted in his pocket - diary the dates of all that he received , as well as those addressed to Mrs. Brant and Miss Anthony , had not had one to record since the middle of June . And in that there was no allusion to the _ Lusitania _ . “
73315	73329	73231	73231	our	1981	” he said to Boylston , one day toward the end of July ; “
73344	73345	73336	73336	George	175	” “
73355	73361	73350	73350	you	0	” Boylston returned , laughing ; “
73372	73376	73231	73231	our	1981	” he added , “
73410	73411	73412	73412	I	0	” “
73416	73667	73412	73412	I	0	” said Campton , pocketing the diary , and trying for the millionth time to call up a vision of his boy , seated at a desk in some still unvisualized place , his rumpled fair head bent above columns of figures or files of correspondence , while day after day the roof above him shook with the roar of the attacks which held up his letters . BOOK III XXIV The gates of Paris were behind them , and they were rushing through an icy twilight between long lines of houses , factory chimneys and city - girt fields , when Campton at last roused himself and understood . It was he , John Campton , who sat in that car — that noiseless swiftly - sliding car , so cushioned and commodious , so ingeniously fitted for all the exigencies and emergencies of travel , that it might have been a section of the Nouveau Luxe on wheels ; and the figure next to him , on the extreme other side of the deeply upholstered seat , was that of Anderson Brant . This , for the moment , was as far as Campton ’s dazed perceptions carried him .... The motor was among real fields and orchards , and the icy half - light which might just as well have been dusk was turning definitely to dawn , when at last , disentangling his mind from a tight coil of passport and permit problems , he thought : “
73684	73852	73853	73853	We	1988	” Among all the multiplied strangenesses of the last strange hours it had hardly struck him before that , now he was finally on his way to George , it was not to the Argonne that he was going , but in the opposite direction . The discovery held his floating mind for a moment , but for a moment only , before it drifted away again , to be caught on some other projecting strangeness . Chief among these was Mr. Brant ’s presence at his side , and the fact that the motor they were sitting in was Mr. Brant ’s . But Campton felt that such enormities were not to be dealt with yet . He had neither slept nor eaten since the morning before , and whenever he tried to grasp the situation in its entirety his spirit fainted away again into outer darkness .... His companion presently coughed , and said , in a voice even more than usually colourless and expressionless : “
73859	73921	73853	73853	We	1988	” It was the first time , Campton was sure , that Mr. Brant had spoken since they had got into the car together , hours earlier as it seemed to him , in the dark street before the studio in Montmartre ; the first , at least , except to ask , as the chauffeur touched the self - starter : “
73930	74042	73923	73923	you	1989	” The two travellers did not share a rug : a separate one , soft as fur and light as down , lay neatly folded on the grey carpet before each seat ; but Campton , though the early air was biting , had left his where it lay , and had not answered . Now he was beginning to feel that he could not decently remain silent any longer ; and with an effort which seemed as mechanical and external as the movements of the chauffeur whose back he viewed through the wide single sheet of plate - glass , he brought out , like a far - off echo : “
74046	74115	73923	73923	you	1989	” It was not that there lingered in him any of his old sense of antipathy toward Mr. Brant . In the new world into which he had been abruptly hurled , the previous morning , by the coming of that letter which looked so exactly like any other letter — in this new world Mr. Brant was nothing more than the possessor of the motor and of the “
74117	74334	74526	74526	sir	2499	” that were to get him , Campton , in the shortest possible time , to the spot of earth where his son lay dying . Once assured of this , Campton had promptly and indifferently acquiesced in Miss Anthony ’s hurried suggestion that it would be only decent to let Mr. Brant go to Doullens with him . But the exchange of speech with any one , whether Mr. Brant or another , was for the time being manifestly impossible . The effort , to Campton , to rise out of his grief , was like that of a dying person struggling back from regions too remote for his voice to reach the ears of the living . He shrank into his corner , and tried once more to fix his attention on the flying landscape . All that he saw in it , speeding ahead of him even faster than their own flight , was the ghostly vision of another motor , carrying a figure bowed like his , mute like his : the figure of Fortin - Lescluze , as he had seen it plunge away into the winter darkness after the physician ’s son had been killed . Campton remembered asking himself then , as he had asked himself so often since : “
74346	74497	74526	74526	sir	2499	” He knew the answer to that now , as he knew everything else a man could know : so it had seemed to his astonished soul since the truth had flashed at him out of that fatal letter . Ever since then he had been turning about and about in a vast glare of initiation : of all the old crowded misty world which the letter had emptied at a stroke , nothing remained but a few memories of George ’s boyhood , like a closet of toys in a house knocked down by an earthquake . The vision of Fortin - Lescluze ’s motor vanished , and in its place Campton suddenly saw Boylston ’s screwed - up eyes staring out at him under furrows of anguish . Campton remembered , the evening before , pushing the letter over to him across the office table , and stammering : “
74511	74519	74506	74506	I	0	” and Boylston ’s sudden sobbing explosion : “
74533	74558	74559	74559	You	2499	” and then the endless pause before Campton gathered himself up to falter out ( like a child deciphering the words in a primer ): “
74567	74568	74559	74559	You	2499	” “
74611	74619	74601	74601	me	0	” Boylston had faltered through his sobs . “
74627	74628	74629	74629	You	2499	” “
74694	74695	74686	74686	you	2499	” “
74703	74724	74730	74730	he	175	” Campton had flashed out ; then his heart stood still , and he awaited the answer with lowered head . “
74748	74758	74759	74759	He	175	” Campton looked up again , challenging the other . “
74769	74770	74759	74759	He	175	” “
74773	74778	74785	74785	he	175	yes”—Boylston was perfectly calm about it—“he
74807	74815	74825	74825	he	175	” Boylston ended in a stricken voice , “
74828	74985	74825	74825	he	175	” Over and over again that short dialogue distilled itself syllable by syllable , pang by pang , into Campton ’s cowering soul . He had had to learn all this , this overwhelming unbelievable truth about his son ; and at the same instant to learn that that son was grievously wounded , perhaps dying ( what else , in such circumstances , did the giving of the Legion of Honour ever mean ? ) ; and to deal with it all in the wild minutes of preparation for departure , of intercession with the authorities , sittings at the photographer ’s , and a crisscross of confused telephone - calls from the Embassy , the Prefecture and the War Office . From this welter of images Miss Anthony ’s face next detached itself : white and withered , yet with a look which triumphed over its own ruin , and over Campton ’s wrath . “
75015	75028	75029	75029	I	0	” Campton had burst out at her . She took it firmly . “
75035	75036	75029	75029	I	0	” “
75049	75062	75065	75065	you	2499	” She received this in silence , and he followed it up . “
75084	75094	75075	75075	you	2499	” Without flinching , she gazed back at him . “
75103	75104	75105	75105	I	0	” “
75124	75125	75114	75114	I	0	” “
75128	75136	75114	75114	I	0	” She gave him a wan smile . “
75150	75178	75179	75179	Adele	220	” she cried , and cast herself on Campton ’s breast . He held her there for a long moment , stroking her lank hair , and saying “
75183	75231	75181	75181	Adele	220	” because in that rush of understanding he could not think of anything else to say . At length he stooped and laid on her lips the strangest kiss he had ever given or taken ; and it was then that , drawing back , she exclaimed : “
75245	75422	75423	75423	You	1998	” The image of George ’s mother rose last on the whirling ground of Campton ’s thoughts : an uncertain image , blurred by distance , indistinct as some wraith of Mme . Olida ’s evoking . Mrs. Brant was still at Biarritz ; there had been no possibility of her getting back in time to share the journey to the front . Even Mr. Brant ’s power in high places must have fallen short of such an attempt ; and it was not made . Boylston , despatched in haste to bear the news of George ’s wounding to the banker , had reported that the utmost Mr. Brant could do was to write at once to his wife , and arrange for her return to Paris , since telegrams to the frontier departments travelled more slowly than letters , and in nine cases out of ten were delayed indefinitely . Campton had asked no more at the time ; but in the last moment before leaving Paris he remembered having said to Adele Anthony : “
75431	75439	75428	75428	Julia	194	” and Miss Anthony had nodded back : “
75444	75612	75428	75428	Julia	194	” The word , it appeared , roused the same memory in both of them ; meeting her eyes , he saw there the Gare de l’Est in the summer morning , the noisily manœuvring trains jammed with bright young heads , the flowers , the waving handkerchiefs , and everybody on the platform smiling fixedly till some particular carriage - window slid out of sight . The scene , at the time , had been a vast blur to Campton : would he ever again , he wondered , see anything as clearly as he saw it now , in all its unmerciful distinctness ? He heard the sobs of the girl who had said such a blithe goodbye to the young _ Chasseur Alpin _ , he saw her going away , led by her elderly companion , and powdering her nose at the _ laiterie _ over the cup of coffee she could not swallow . And this was what her sobs had meant .... “
75616	75627	75428	75428	Julia	194	” said Mr. Brant , with his usual preliminary cough , “
75632	75787	75428	75428	Julia	194	” He bent over a motor - map , trying to decipher the name ; but after fumbling for his eye - glasses , and rubbing them with a beautifully monogrammed cambric handkerchief , he folded the map up again and slipped it into one of the many pockets which honeycombed the interior of the car . Campton recalled the deathlike neatness of the banker ’s private office on the day when the one spot of disorder in it had been the torn telegram announcing Benny Upsher ’s disappearance . The motor lowered its speed to make way for a long train of army lorries . Close upon them clattered a file of gun - wagons , with unshaven soldiers bestriding the gaunt horses . Torpedo - cars carrying officers slipped cleverly in and out of the tangle , and motor - cycles , incessantly rushing by , peppered the air with their explosions . “
75807	75910	75428	75428	Julia	194	” Campton mused . He himself had seen something of the same kind when he had gone to Châlons in the early days to appeal to Fortin - Lescluze ; but at that time the dread significance of the machinery of war had passed almost unnoticed in his preoccupation about his boy . Now he realized that for a year that machinery had been the setting of his boy ’s life ; for months past such sights and sounds as these had formed the whole of George ’s world ; and Campton ’s eyes took in every detail with an agonized avidity . “
75915	75972	75428	75428	Julia	194	” he exclaimed . A huge continuous roar , seeming to fall from the low clouds above them , silenced the puny rumble and clatter of the road . On and on it went , in a slow pulsating rhythm , like the boom of waves driven by a gale on some far - distant coast . “
75979	75984	75428	75428	Julia	194	” said Mr. Brant . “
75989	75990	75994	75994	they	2002	” “
76004	76143	75994	75994	they	2002	” Campton sat bewildered . Had he ever before heard that sinister roar ? At Châlons ? He could not be sure . But the sound had assuredly not been the same ; now it overwhelmed him like the crash of the sea over a drowning head . He cowered back in his corner . Would it ever stop , he asked himself ? Or was it always like this , day and night , in the hell of hells that they were bound for ? Was that merciless thud forever in the ears of the dying ? A sentinel stopped the motor and asked for their pass . He turned it about and about , holding it upside - down in his horny hands , and wrinkling his brows in the effort to decipher the inverted characters . “
76151	76186	76146	76146	I	0	” he grumbled doubtfully , looking from the faces of the two travellers to their unrecognizable photographs . Mr. Brant was already feeling for his pocket , and furtively extracting a bank - note . “
76195	76217	76146	76146	I	0	” Campton cried , bringing his hand down on the banker ’s . Leaning over , he spoke to the sentinel . “
76237	76249	76228	76228	you	0	” The man looked , and slowly gave back the paper . “
76254	76293	76250	76250	You	0	” he said , shouldering his rifle . The motor shot on , and the two men drew back into their corners . Mr. Brant fidgeted with his eye - glasses , and after an interval coughed again . “
76299	76303	76297	76297	you	0	” he began , “
76327	76328	76321	76321	one	398	” “
76332	76337	76321	76321	one	398	” said Campton drily . “
76344	76345	76297	76297	you	0	” “
76352	76519	76297	76297	you	0	” Silence fell once more . Mr. Brant sat bolt upright , his profile detached against the wintry fields . Campton , sunk into his corner , glanced now and then at the neat grey silhouette , in which the perpendicular glint of the eye - glass nearest him was the only point of light . He said to himself that the man was no doubt suffering horribly ; but he was not conscious of any impulse of compassion . He and Mr. Brant were like two strangers pinned down together in a railway - smash : the shared agony did not bring them nearer . On the contrary , Campton , as the hours passed , felt himself more and more exasperated by the mute anguish at his side . What right had this man to be suffering as he himself was suffering , what right to be here with him at all ? It was simply in the exercise of what the banker called his “
76520	76552	76553	76553	I	0	habit”—the habit of paying , of buying everything , people and privileges and possessions — that he had acquired this ghastly claim to share in an agony which was not his . “
76566	76644	76553	76553	I	0	” the father thought in desperation ; and the mute presence at his side became once more the symbol of his own failure . The motor , with frequent halts , continued to crawl slowly on between lorries , field - kitchens , artillery wagons , companies of haggard infantry returning to their cantonments , and more and more vanloads of troops pressing forward ; it seemed to Campton that hours elapsed before Mr. Brant again spoke . “
76650	76817	76553	76553	I	0	” he said , in a voice even lower than usual . The father roused himself and looked out . They were passing through the streets of a town swarming with troops — but he was still barely conscious of what he looked at . He perceived that he had been half - asleep , and dreaming of George as a little boy , when he used to have such bad colds . Campton remembered in particular the day he had found the lad in bed , in a scarlet sweater , in his luxurious overheated room , reading the first edition of Lavengro . It was on that day that he and his son had first really got to know each other ; but what was it that had marked the date to George ? The fact that Mr. Brant , learning of his joy in the book , had instantly presented it to him — with the price - label left inside the cover . “
76836	76854	76831	76831	you	2006	” Mr. Brant had told his stepson ; to which George was recorded to have answered sturdily : “
76870	76919	76920	76920	They	2007	” Miss Anthony had assisted at the conversation and reported it triumphantly to Campton ; but the painter , who had to save up to give his boy even a simple present , could see in the incident only one more attempt to rob him of his rights . “
76946	77145	76943	76944	the Lord	453	” he had said . But they had succeeded after all ; what better proof of it was there than Mr. Brant ’s tacit right to be sitting here beside him to - day ; than the fact that but for Mr. Brant it might have been impossible for Campton to get to his boy ’s side in time ? Oh , that pitiless incessant hammering of the guns ! As the travellers advanced the noise grew louder , fiercer , more unbroken ; the closely - fitted panes of the car rattled and danced like those of an old omnibus . Sentinels stopped the chauffeur more frequently ; Mr. Brant had to produce the blue paper again and again . The day was wearing on — Campton began again to be aware of a sick weariness , a growing remoteness and confusion of mind . Through it he perceived that Mr. Brant , diving into deeper recesses of upholstery , had brought out a silver sandwich - box , a flask and glasses . As by magic they stood on a shiny shelf which slid out of another recess , and Mr. Brant was proffering the box . “
77160	77261	76943	76944	the Lord	453	” he said . Campton , who had half turned from the invitation , seized a sandwich and emptied one of the glasses . Mr. Brant was right ; he must not let himself float away into the void , seductive as its drowsy shimmer was . His wits returned , and with them a more intolerable sense of reality . He was all alive now . Every crash of the guns seemed to tear a piece of flesh from his body ; and it was always the piece nearest the heart . The nurse ’s few lines had said : “
77276	77414	77415	77415	Doullens	331	” And one of these awful crashes had done it : bursting in mystery from that innocent - looking sky , and rushing inoffensively over hundreds of other young men till it reached its destined prey , found George , and dug a red grave for him . Campton was convinced now that his son was dead . It was not only that he had received the Legion of Honour ; it was the appalling all - destroying thunder of the shells as they went on crashing and bursting . What could they leave behind them but mismated fragments ? Gathering up all his strength in the effort not to recoil from the vision , Campton saw his son ’s beautiful body like a carcass tumbled out of a butcher ’s cart .... * * * * * “
77417	77593	77415	77415	Doullens	331	” said Mr. Brant . They were in a town , and the motor had turned into the court of a great barrack - like building . Before them stood a line of empty stretchers such as Campton had seen at Châlons . A young doctor in a cotton blouse was lighting a cigarette and laughing with a nurse — laughing ! At regular intervals the cannonade shook the windows ; it seemed the heart - beat of the place . Campton noticed that many of the window - panes had been broken , and patched with paper . Inside they found another official , who called to another nurse as she passed by laden with fresh towels . She disappeared into a room where heaps of bloody linen were being stacked into baskets , returned , looked at Campton and nodded . He looked back at her blunt tired features and kindly eyes , and said to himself that they had perhaps been his son ’s last sight on earth . The nurse smiled . “
77600	77604	78015	78018	a white voice ”	4010	” she said ; “
77610	77677	78015	78018	a white voice ”	4010	” Glad ! He was not dead , then ; he could even be glad ! In the staggering rush of relief the father turned instinctively to Mr. Brant ; he felt that there was enough joy to be shared . But Mr. Brant , though he must have heard what the nurse had said , was moving away ; he did not seem to understand . “
77682	77738	78015	78018	a white voice ”	4010	” Campton called after him , pointing to the nurse , who was already on the first step of the stairs . Mr. Brant looked slightly puzzled ; then , as the other ’s meaning reached him , he coloured a little , bent his head stiffly , and waved his stick toward the door . “
77741	77745	77746	77746	I	0	” he said , “
77759	77868	78015	78018	a white voice ”	4010	” and Campton , with a rush of gratitude , understood that he was to be left alone with his son . XXV He followed his guide up the steep flights , which seemed to become buoyant and lift him like waves . It was as if the muscle that always dragged back his lame leg had suddenly regained its elasticity . He floated up as one mounts stairs in a dream . A smell of disinfectants hung in the cold air , and once , through a half - open door , a sickening odour came : he remembered it at Châlons , and Fortin ’s murmured : “
77881	78014	78015	78018	a white voice ”	4010	” How soon had they got _ his _ boy , Campton wondered ? The letter , mercifully sent by hand to Paris , had reached him on the third day after George ’s arrival at the Doullens hospital ; but he did not yet know how long before that the shell - splinter had done its work . The nurse did not know either . How could she remember ? They had so many ! The administrator would look up the files and tell him . Only there was no time for that now . On a landing Campton heard a babble and scream : a nauseating scream in a queer bleached voice that might have been man , woman or monkey ’s . Perhaps that was what the French meant by “
78018	78053	78015	78018	a white voice ”	4010	” : this voice which was as featureless as some of the poor men ’s obliterated faces ! Campton shot an anguished look at his companion , and she understood and shook her head . “
78075	78230	78069	78069	they	2013	” She opened a door , and he was in a room with three beds in it , wooden pallets hastily knocked together and spread with rough grey blankets . In spite of the cold , flies still swarmed on the unwashed panes , and there were big holes in the fly - net over the bed nearest the window . Under the net lay a middle - aged bearded man , heavily bandaged about the chest and left arm : he was snoring , his mouth open , his gaunt cheeks drawn in with the fight for breath . Campton said to himself that if his own boy lived he should like some day to do something for this poor devil who was his roommate . Then he looked about him and saw that the two other beds were empty . He drew back . The nurse was bending over the bearded man . “
78239	78309	78236	78236	I’ll	2015	” ; and she slipped out . Campton looked again at the stranger ; then his glance travelled to the scarred brown hand on the sheet , a hand with broken nails and blackened finger - tips . It was George ’s hand , his son ’s , swollen , disfigured but unmistakable . The father knelt down and laid his lips on it . * * * * * “
78318	78329	78315	78315	you	2014	” Adele Anthony asked him afterward : and he answered : “
78332	78333	78315	78315	you	2014	” “
78363	78372	78382	78382	him	2014	” He considered , and then said slowly : “
78376	78377	78382	78382	him	2014	” “
78385	78386	78382	78382	him	2014	” “
78396	78410	78382	78382	him	2014	” Miss Anthony , who understood as a rule , was evidently puzzled . “
78417	78418	78382	78382	him	2014	” “
78425	78525	78382	78382	him	2014	” With that she had to be content . The sense of it had first come to Campton when the bearded man , raising his lids , looked at him from far off with George ’s eyes , and touched him , very feebly , with George ’s hand . It was in the moment of identifying his son that he felt the son he had known to be lost to him forever . George ’s lips were moving , and the father laid his ear to them ; perhaps these were last words that his boy was saying . “
78533	78555	78526	78527	Old Dad	332	” Campton nodded . The fact seemed faintly to interest George , who continued to examine him with those distant eyes . “
78560	78565	78566	78566	Mother	333	” Campton nodded again . “
78570	78571	78566	78566	Mother	333	” “
78580	78591	78572	78572	She	333	” George ’s lips were screwed into a whimsical smile . “
78599	78619	78620	78622	The other gentleman	2017	” he said , and drowsed off again , his hand in Campton ’s .... * * * * * “
78625	78776	78620	78622	The other gentleman	2017	” the nurse questioned the next morning . Campton had spent the night in the hospital , stretched on the floor at his son ’s threshold . It was a breach of rules , but for once the major had condoned it . As for Mr. Brant , Campton had forgotten all about him , and at first did not know what the nurse meant . Then he woke with a start to the consciousness of his fellow - traveller ’s nearness . Mr. Brant , the nurse explained , had come to the hospital early , and had been waiting below for the last two hours . Campton , almost as gaunt and unshorn as his son , pulled himself to his feet and went down . In the hall the banker , very white , but smooth and trim as ever , was patiently measuring the muddy flags . “
78782	78790	78620	78622	The other gentleman	2017	” Campton called from the last flight . “
78793	78817	78620	78622	The other gentleman	2017	” stammered Mr. Brant , red and pale by turns . Campton smiled haggardly and pulled himself together in an effort of communicativeness . “
78846	78873	78874	78874	I	0	” Mr. Brant , speechless , stood stiffly waiting to be conducted . Campton noticed the mist in his eyes , and took pity on him . “
78907	78964	78965	78965	I	0	” the father said , with a magnanimity which he somehow felt the powers might take account of in their subsequent dealings with George . If the boy was to live Campton could afford to be generous ; and he had decided to assume that the boy would live , and to order his behaviour accordingly . “
78970	78980	78968	78968	you	2019	” said Mr. Brant , turning toward the stairs . “
78987	79039	78968	78968	you	2019	” Campton cautioned him , and hurried out into the morning air through which the guns still crashed methodically . When he got back to the hospital , refreshed and decent , he was surprised , and for a moment alarmed , to find that Mr. Brant had not come down . “
79051	79082	78968	78968	you	2019	” Campton raged , scrambling up the stairs as fast as his stiff leg permitted . But outside of George ’s door he saw a small figure patiently mounting guard . “
79100	79101	79092	79092	I	0	” “
79109	79120	79092	79092	I	0	” Campton paused , and then made his supreme effort . “
79127	79128	79123	79123	he	2018	” “
79140	79149	79133	79133	He	2018	” Mr. Brant said with a twitching smile . “
79193	79219	79220	79220	I	0	” The two men were silent , the same passion of anxiety consuming them , and no means left of communicating it to each other . “
79241	79246	79252	79252	you	2019	” Mr. Brant suggested . “
79255	79777	79252	79252	you	2019	” Campton put out his hand and crushed Mr. Brant ’s dry fingers . But for this man he might not have got to his son in time ; and this man had not once made use of the fact to press his own claim on George . With pity in his heart , the father , privileged to remain at his son ’s bedside , watched Mr. Brant ’s small figure retreating alone . How ghastly to sit all day in that squalid hotel , his eyes on his watch , with nothing to do but to wonder and wonder about the temperature of another man ’s son ! * * * * * The next day was worse ; so much worse that everything disappeared from Campton ’s view but the present agony of watching , hovering , hanging helplessly on the words of nurse and doctor , and spying on the glances they exchanged behind his back . There could be no thought yet of extracting the bullet ; a great surgeon , passing through the wards on a hasty tour of inspection , had confirmed this verdict . Oh , to have kept the surgeon there — to have had him at hand to watch for the propitious moment and seize it without an instant ’s delay ! Suddenly the vision which to Campton had been among the most hideous of all his crowding nightmares — that of George stretched naked on an operating - table , his face hidden by a chloroform mask , and an orderly hurrying away with a pile of red towels like those perpetually carried through the passages below — this vision became to the father ’s fevered mind as soothing as a glimpse of Paradise . If only George ’s temperature would go down — if only the doctors would pronounce him strong enough to have the bullet taken out ! What would anything else matter then ? Campton would feel as safe as he used to years ago , when after the recurring months of separation the boy came back from school , and he could take him in his arms and make sure that he was the same Georgie , only bigger , browner , with thicker curlier hair , and tougher muscles under his jacket . What if the great surgeon , on his way back from the front , were to pass through the town again that evening , reverse his verdict , and perhaps even perform the operation then and there ? Was there no way of prevailing on him to stop and take another look at George on the return ? The idea took immediate possession of Campton , crowding out his intolerable anguish , and bringing such relief that for a few seconds he felt as if some life - saving operation had been performed on himself . As he stood watching the great man ’s retreat , followed by doctors and nurses , Mr. Brant suddenly touched his arm , and the eyes of the two met . Campton understood and gasped out : “
79790	79795	79252	79252	you	2019	” Mr. Brant nodded . “
79800	79813	79814	79814	You	2025	” He paused , again interrogated Campton ’s eyes , and stammered : “
79819	79820	79814	79814	You	2025	” “
79827	79828	79829	79829	He	2024	” “
79838	79851	79829	79829	He	2024	” Mr. Brant threw in , as if trying to justify himself . “
79857	79876	79829	79829	He	2024	” Campton almost pushed him down the stairs . Ten minutes later he reappeared , modest but exultant . “
79879	79880	79881	79881	He	2024	” “
79892	79893	79888	79889	the others	3170	” “
79897	79898	79888	79889	the others	3170	” “
79912	79913	79904	79904	he	2024	” “
79916	79917	79904	79904	he	2024	” “
79927	80041	80048	80048	them	2030	” Campton turned away , choking , and stumped off toward the tall window at the end of the passage . Below him lay the court . A line of stretchers was being carried across it , not empty this time , but each one with a bloody burden . Doctors , nurses , orderlies hurried to and fro . Drub , drub , drub , went the guns , shaking the windows , rolling their fierce din along the cloudy sky , down the corridors of the hospital and the pavement of the streets , like huge bowls crashing through story above story of a kind of sky - scraping bowling alley . “
80050	80083	80043	80045	the dead underground	2029	” Campton muttered . The word made him shudder superstitiously , and he crept back to George ’s door and opened it ; but the nurse , within , shook her head . “
80094	80189	80190	80190	He	2031	” Campton turned and saw Mr. Brant waiting . A bell rang twelve . The two , in silence , walked down the stairs , crossed the court ( averting their eyes from the stretchers ) and went to the hotel to get something to eat . * * * * * Midnight came . It passed . No one in the hurried confused world of the hospital had heard of the possibility of the surgeon ’s returning . When Campton mentioned it to the nurse she smiled her tired smile , and said : “
80196	80353	80190	80190	He	2031	” Done nothing ! How could she know ? How could any one , but the surgeon himself ? Would he have promised if he had not thought there was some chance ? Campton , stretched out on a blanket and his rolled - up coat , lay through the long restless hours staring at the moonlit sky framed by the window of the corridor . Great clouds swept over that cold indifferent vault : they seemed like the smoke from the guns which had not once ceased through the night . At last he got up , turned his back on the window , and lay down again facing the stairs . The moonlight unrolled a white strip along the stone floor . A church - bell rang one ... two ... there were noises and movements below . Campton raised himself , his heart beating all over his body . Steps came echoing up . “
80356	80475	80476	80476	I	0	” some one called . A stretcher rounded the stair - rail ; another , and then another . An orderly with a lantern preceded them , followed by one of the doctors , an old bunched - up man in a muddy uniform , who stopped furtively to take a pinch of snuff . Campton could not believe his eyes ; did n’t the hospital people know that every bed on that floor was full ? Every bed , that is , but the two in George ’s room ; and the nurse had given Campton the hope , the promise almost , that as long as his boy was so ill she would keep those empty . “
80481	80513	80476	80476	I	0	” she had said . For a mad moment Campton was on the point of throwing himself in the way of the tragic procession , barring the threshold with his arms . “
80519	80542	80543	80544	More casualties	2032	” he stammered to the nurse , who had appeared from another room with her little lamp . She gave a shrug . “
80552	80594	80543	80544	More casualties	2032	” He stood aside , wrathful , impotent . At least if Brant had been there , perhaps by some offer of money — but how , to whom ? Of what earthly use , after all , was Brant ’s boasted “
80596	80622	80623	80623	You	2034	” ? These people would only laugh at him — perhaps put them both out of the hospital ! He turned despairingly to the nurse . “
80634	80635	80623	80623	You	2034	” “
80643	80738	80739	80739	Both	2972	” she answered ; and the echo of his own words horrified him like a sacrilege . Two of the stretchers were carried into George ’s room . Campton caught a glimpse of George , muttering and tossing ; the moonlight lay in the hollows of his bearded face , and again the father had the sense of utter alienation from that dark delirious man who for brief intervals suddenly became his son , and then as suddenly wandered off into strangeness . The nurse slipped out of the room and signed to him . “
80750	80970	80743	80743	they	2972	” she whispered . The man on the third stretcher was taken to a room at the other end of the corridor . Campton watched him being lifted in . He was to lie on the floor , then ? For in that room there was certainly no vacancy . But presently he had the answer . The bearers did not come out empty - handed ; they carried another man whom they laid on the empty stretcher . Lucky , lucky devil ; going , no doubt , to a hospital at the rear ! As the procession reached the stairs the lantern swung above the lucky devil ’s face : his eyes stared ceilingward from black orbits . One arm , swinging loose , dangled down , the hand stealthily counting the steps as he descended — and no one troubled , for he was dead . At dawn Campton , who must have been asleep , started up , again hearing steps . The surgeon ? Oh , if this time it were the surgeon ! But only Mr. Brant detached himself from the shadows accumulated in the long corridor : Mr. Brant , crumpled and unshorn , with blood - shot eyes , and gloves on his unconscious hands . Campton glared at him resentfully . “
80984	80995	80978	80978	I	0	” he exclaimed . Mr. Brant shook his head despondently . “
81044	81083	81084	81084	You	0	” Campton saw two tears running down Mr. Brant ’s face : they did not move him . The banker glanced toward George ’s door , full of the question he dared not put . Campton answered it . “
81131	81143	81144	81146	Two more men	2045	” Campton almost shouted . Mr. Brant was trembling all over . “
81152	81157	81144	81146	Two more men	2045	” he echoed shrilly . “
81165	81172	81144	81146	Two more men	2045	” Campton drew a deep breath . “
81198	81208	81209	81209	You	0	” The nurse opened the door and looked out . “
81215	81239	81209	81209	You	0	” she said . She shut the door , and the two men stood silent , abashed ; finally Mr. Brant turned away . “
81256	81260	81263	81264	your surgeons	2049	” he whispered . “
81271	82206	82207	82207	I	0	” Campton sneered after him , in the same whisper . XXVI From the room where he sat at the foot of George ’s glossy white bed , Campton , through the open door , could watch the November sun slanting down a white ward where , in the lane between other white beds , pots of chrysanthemums stood on white - covered tables . Through the window his eyes rested incredulously on a court enclosed in monastic arches of grey stone , with squares of turf bordered by box hedges , and a fountain playing . Beyond the court sloped the faded foliage of a park not yet entirely stripped by Channel gales ; and on days without wind , instead of the boom of the guns , the roar of the sea came faintly over intervening heights and hollows . Campton ’s ears were even more incredulous than his eyes . He was gradually coming to believe in George ’s white room , the ward beyond , the flowers between the beds , the fountain in the court ; but the sound of the sea still came to him , intolerably but unescapably , as the crash of guns . When the impression was too overwhelming he would turn away from the window and cast his glance on the bed ; but only to find that the smooth young face on the pillow had suddenly changed into that of the haggard bearded stranger on the wooden pallet at Doullens . And Campton would have to get up , lean over , and catch the twinkle in George ’s eyes before the evil spell was broken . Few words passed between them . George , after all these days , was still too weak for much talk ; and silence had always been Campton ’s escape from feeling . He never had the need to speak in times of inward stress , unless it were to vent his anger — as in that hateful scene at Doullens between himself and Mr. Brant . But he was sure that George always knew what was passing through his mind ; that when the sea boomed their thoughts flew back together to that other scene , but a few miles and a few days distant , yet already as far off , as much an affair they were both rid of , as a nightmare to a wakened sleeper ; and that for a moment the same vision clutched them both , mocking their attempts at indifference . Not that the sound , to Campton at any rate , suggested any abstract conception of war . Looking back afterward at this phase of his life he perceived that at no time had he thought so little of the war . The noise of the sea was to him simply the voice of the engine which had so nearly destroyed his son : that association , deeply embedded in his half - dazed consciousness , left no room for others . The general impression of unreality was enhanced by his not having yet been able to learn the details of George ’s wounding . After a week during which the boy had hung near death , the great surgeon — returning to Doullens just as Campton had finally ceased to hope for him — had announced that , though George ’s state was still grave , he might be moved to a hospital at the rear . So one day , miraculously , the perilous transfer had been made , in one of Mrs. Brant ’s own motor - ambulances ; and for a week now George had lain in his white bed , hung over by white - gowned Sisters , in an atmosphere of sweetness and order which almost made it seem as if he were a child recovering from illness in his own nursery , or a red - haired baby sparring with dimpled fists at a new world . In truth , Campton found his son as hard to get at as a baby ; he looked at his father with eyes as void of experience , or at least of any means of conveying it . Campton , at first , could only marvel and wait ; and the isolation in which the two were enclosed by George ’s weakness , and by his father ’s inability to learn from others what the boy was not yet able to tell him , gave a strange remoteness to everything but the things which count in an infant ’s world : food , warmth , sleep . Campton ’s nearest approach to reality was his daily scrutiny of the temperature - chart . He studied it as he used to study the _ communiqués _ which he now no longer even thought of . Sometimes when George was asleep Campton would sit pondering on the days at Doullens . There was an exquisite joy in silently building up , on that foundation of darkness and anguish , the walls of peace that now surrounded him , a structure so transparent that one could peer through it at the routed Furies , yet so impenetrable that he sat there in a kind of god - like aloofness . For one thing he was especially thankful — and that was the conclusion of his unseemly wrangle with Mr. Brant ; thankful that , almost at once , he had hurried after the banker , caught up with him , and stammered out , clutching his hand : “
82216	82311	82213	82213	you	2050	” Mr. Brant ’s reactions were never rapid , and the events of the preceding days had called upon faculties that were almost atrophied . He had merely looked at Campton in mute distress , returned his pressure , and silently remounted the hospital stairs with him . Campton hated himself for his ill - temper , but was glad , even at the time , that no interested motive had prompted his apology . He should have hated himself even more if he had asked the banker ’s pardon because of Mr. Brant ’s “
82314	82601	82213	82213	you	2050	” and the uses to which it might be put ; or even if he had associated his excuses with any past motives of gratitude , such as the fact that but for Mr. Brant he might never have reached George ’s side . Instead of that , he simply felt that once more his senseless violence had got the better of him , and he was sorry that he had behaved like a brute to a man who loved George , and was suffering almost as much as he was at the thought that George might die .... After that episode , and Campton ’s apology , the relations of the two men became so easy that each gradually came to take the other for granted ; and Mr. Brant , relieved of a perpetual hostile scrutiny , was free to exercise his ingenuity in planning and managing . It was owing to him — Campton no longer minded admitting it — that the famous surgeon had hastened his return to Doullens , that George ’s translation to the sweet monastic building near the sea had been so rapidly effected , and that the great man , appearing there soon afterward , had extracted the bullet with his own hand . But for Mr. Brant ’s persistence even the leave to bring one of Mrs. Brant ’s motor - ambulances to Doullens would never have been given ; and it might have been fatal to George to make the journey in a slow and jolting military train . But for Mr. Brant , again , he would have been sent to a crowded military hospital instead of being brought to this white heaven of rest . “
82633	82670	82693	82693	He	229	” Campton , at the thought , lowered his spirit into new depths of contrition . * * * * * George , who had been asleep , opened his eyes and looked at his father . “
82676	82677	82673	82674	Uncle Andy	229	” “
82686	82687	82673	82674	Uncle Andy	229	” “
82698	83166	82693	82693	He	229	” George smiled , and withdrew once more into his secret world . But Campton ’s state of mind was less happy . As the time of Julia ’s arrival approached he began to ask himself with increasing apprehension how she would fit into the situation . Mr. Brant _ had _ fitted into it — perfectly . Campton had actually begun to feel a secret dependence on him , a fidgety uneasiness since he had left for Paris , sweet though it was to be alone with George . But Julia — what might she not do and say to unsettle things , break the spell , agitate and unnerve them all ? Campton did not question her love for her son ; but he was not sure what form it would take in conditions to which she was so unsuited . How could she ever penetrate into the mystery of peace which enclosed him and his boy ? And if she felt them thus mysteriously shut off would she not dimly resent her exclusion ? If only Adele Anthony had been coming too ! Campton had urged Mr. Brant to bring her ; but the banker had failed to obtain a permit for any one but the boy ’s mother . He had even found it difficult to get his own leave renewed ; it was only after a first trip to Paris , and repeated efforts at the War Office , that he had been allowed to go to Paris and fetch his wife , who was just arriving from Biarritz . Well — for the moment , at any rate , Campton had the boy to himself . As he sat there , trying to picture the gradual resurrection of George ’s pre - war face out of the delicately pencilled white mask on the pillow , he noted the curious change of planes produced by suffering and emaciation , and the altered relation of lights and shadows . Materially speaking , the new George looked like the old one seen in the bowl of a spoon , and through blue spectacles : peaked , narrow , livid , with elongated nose and sunken eye - sockets . But these altered proportions were not what had really changed him . There was something in the curve of the mouth that fever and emaciation could not account for . In that new line , and in the look of his eyes — the look travelling slowly outward through a long blue tunnel , like some mysterious creature rising from the depths of the sea — that was where the new George lurked , the George to be watched and lain in wait for , patiently and slowly puzzled out .... He reopened his eyes . “
83170	83183	83167	83167	Adele	220	” Campton had learned to bridge over the spaces between the questions . “
83208	83209	83204	83204	I	0	” “
83215	83216	83210	83210	She	2054	” “
83221	83222	83219	83219	Blooming	337	” “
83226	83227	83228	83228	Blooming	337	” “
83231	83636	83228	83228	Blooming	337	” George ’s lids closed contentedly , like doors shutting him away from the world . It was the first time since his operation that he had asked about any of his friends , or had appeared to think they might come to see him . But his mind , like his stomach , could receive very little nutriment at a time ; he liked to have one mouthful given to him , and then to lie ruminating it in the lengthening intervals between his attacks of pain . Each time he asked for news of any one his father wondered what name would next come to his lips . Even during his delirium he had mentioned no one but his parents , Mr. Brant , Adele Anthony and Boylston ; yet it was not possible , Campton thought , that these formed the circumference of his life , that some contracted fold of memory did not hold a nearer image , a more secret name .... The father ’s heart beat faster , half from curiosity , half from a kind of shy delicacy , at the thought that at any moment that name might wake in George and utter itself . Campton ’s thoughts again turned to his wife . With Julia there was never any knowing . Ten to one she would send the boy ’s temperature up . He was thankful that , owing to the difficulty of getting the news to her , and then of bringing her back from a frontier department , so many days had had to elapse . But when she arrived , nothing , after all , happened as he had expected . She had put on her nurse ’s dress for the journey ( he thought it rather theatrical of her , till he remembered how much easier it was to get about in any sort of uniform ) ; but there was not a trace of coquetry in her appearance . As a frame for her haggard unpowdered face the white coif looked harsh and unbecoming ; she reminded him , as she got out of the motor , of some mortified Jansenist nun from one of Philippe de Champaigne ’s canvases . Campton led her to George ’s door , but left her there ; she did not appear to notice whether or not he was following her . He whispered : “
83647	83916	83642	83642	he	2055	” and she bent her profile silently as she went in . XXVII George , that evening , seemed rather better , and his temperature had not gone up : Campton had to repress a movement of jealousy at Julia ’s having done her son no harm . Her experience as a nurse , disciplining a vague gift for the sickroom , had developed in her the faculty of self - command : before the war , if George had met with a dangerous accident , she would have been more encumbering than helpful . Campton had to admit the change , but it did not draw them any nearer . Her manner of loving their son was too different . Nowadays , when he and Anderson Brant were together , he felt that they were thinking of the same things in the same way ; but Julia ’s face , even aged and humanized by grief , was still a mere mask to him . He could never tell what form her thoughts about George might be taking . Mr. Brant , on his wife ’s arrival , had judged it discreet to efface himself . Campton hunted for him in vain in the park , and under the cloister ; he remained invisible till they met at the early dinner which they shared with the staff . But the meal did not last long , and when it was over , and nurses and doctors scattered , Mr. Brant again slipped away , leaving his wife and Campton alone . Campton glanced after him , surprised . “
83922	83944	83919	83919	he	2056	” Mrs. Brant pursed her lips , evidently as much surprised by his question as he by her husband ’s withdrawal . “
83964	83965	83919	83919	he	2056	” “
83969	83973	83919	83919	he	2056	” She stared . “
83981	83987	83989	83989	he	2056	” Campton was genuinely astonished . “
83995	83996	83991	83991	I	0	” “
84000	84007	83991	83991	I	0	” She seemed unprepared for this . “
84031	84032	83991	83991	I	0	” “
84044	84112	83991	83991	I	0	” She did not take this up , and one of their usual silences followed . Campton was thinking that it was all nonsense about the nuns , and meditating on the advisability of going in pursuit of Mr. Brant to tell him so . He dreaded the prospect of a long succession of days alone between George and George ’s mother . Mrs. Brant spoke again . “
84133	84134	84135	84136	The Sisters	336	” “
84175	84183	84169	84169	They	715	” She hesitated and coloured a little . “
84198	84227	84184	84184	I	0	” she finally said . Campton repeated her words blankly . He began to think that anxiety and fatigue had confused her mind . She coloured more deeply . “
84264	84295	84296	84296	Anderson	196	” She groped for her reticule , found it in the folds of the cloak she had kept about her shoulders , and fumbled in it with wrinkled jewelled fingers . “
84310	84315	84296	84296	Anderson	196	” she asked suddenly . “
84330	84331	84346	84346	he	175	” “
84379	84416	84376	84377	that woman	2066	” Campton did not press her further . He sat dumbfounded , trying to take in what she was so obviously trying to communicate , and yet instinctively resisting the approach of the revelation he foresaw . “
84422	84438	84439	84439	I	0	” He forced himself to couple the two names , unnatural as their union seemed . “
84455	84468	84449	84452	A woman old enough	2067	” She drew a letter from her bag . He interrupted her . “
84479	84480	84473	84473	you	2066	” “
84537	84827	84494	84494	She	2066	” She began to whimper . Campton reached out for the letter . Mrs. Talkett — Madge Talkett and George ! That was where the boy had gone then , that last night when his father , left alone at the Crillon , had been so hurt by his desertion ! That was the name which , in his hours of vigil in the little white room , Campton had watched for on his son ’s lips , the name which , one day , sooner or later , he would have to hear them pronounce .... How little he had thought , as he sat studying the mysterious beauty of George ’s face , what a commonplace secret it concealed ! The writing was not George ’s , but that of an unlettered French soldier . Campton , glancing at the signature , recalled it as that of his son ’s orderly , who had been slightly wounded in the same attack as George , and sent for twenty - four hours to the same hospital at Doullens . He had been at George ’s side when he fell , and with the simple directness often natural to his class in France he told the tale of his lieutenant ’s wounding , in circumstances which appeared to have given George great glory in the eyes of his men . They thought the wound mortal ; but the orderly and a stretcher - bearer had managed to get the young man into the shelter of a little wood . The stretcher - bearer , it turned out , was a priest . He had at once applied the consecrated oil , and George , still conscious , had received it “
84832	84941	84494	84494	She	2066	” ; then the orderly , thinking all was over , had hurried back to the fighting , and been wounded . The next day he too had been carried to Doullens ; and there , after many enquiries , he had found his lieutenant in the same hospital , alive , but too ill to see him . He had contrived , however , to see the nurse , and had learned from her that the doctors had not given up hope . With that he had to be content ; but before returning to his base he had hastened to fulfill his lieutenant ’s instructions ( given “
84945	84951	84952	84953	his lady	2070	” ) by writing to tell “
84954	84963	84952	84953	his lady	2070	” that he was severely wounded , but still alive—“which
84971	84977	84952	84953	his lady	2070	” the orderly hopefully ended , “
84988	85040	84952	84953	his lady	2070	” Campton laid the letter down . There was too much to be taken in all at once ; and , as usual in moments of deep disturbance , he wanted to be alone , above all wanted to be away from Julia . But Julia held him with insistent eyes . “
85046	85060	85042	85042	you	2071	” he asked finally , pushing the letter toward her . She recoiled . “
85121	85160	85113	85113	you	2071	” Campton shook his head , and perceived by her look of relief that what she had resented above all was the thought of his being in a secret of George ’s from which she herself was excluded . “
85167	85225	85161	85161	Adele	220	” she said , with evident satisfaction . Campton remembered that he had been struck by Miss Anthony ’s look of sincerity when he had asked her if she had any idea where George had spent his last evening , and she had answered negatively . This recollection made him understand Mrs. Brant ’s feeling of relief . “
85242	85246	85161	85161	Adele	220	” he hazarded . “
85250	85263	85161	85161	Adele	220	” Mrs. Brant ’s Mater Dolorosa face suddenly sharpened to worldly astuteness . “
85288	85292	85272	85272	George	175	” Campton considered . “
85305	85306	85303	85303	her	2074	” “
85312	85461	85303	85303	her	2074	” Her eyes had the irritated look he had seen on the far - off day when he had thrown Beausite ’s dinner invitation into the fire . Once more , they seemed to say , she had taken the measure of his worldly wisdom . George ’s silence — his care not even to mention that the Talketts were so much as known to him — certainly made it look as though the matter went deep with him . Campton , recalling the tone of the Talkett drawing - room and its familiars , had an even stronger recoil of indignation than Julia ’s ; but he was silenced by a dread of tampering with his son ’s privacy , a sense of the sacredness of everything pertaining to that still - mysterious figure in the white bed upstairs . Mrs. Brant ’s face had clouded again . “
85504	85583	85489	85491	the Roman Church	2076	” Campton remembered with a faint inward amusement that , in spite of her foreign bringing - up , and all her continental affinities , Julia had remained as implacably and incuriously Protestant as if all her life she had heard the Scarlet Woman denounced from Presbyterian pulpits . At another time it would have amused him to ponder on this one streak in her of the ancestral iron ; but now he wanted only to console her . “
85613	85620	85600	85603	One of our chaplains	2080	” She looked at him mistrustfully . “
85668	85675	85676	85677	A priest	4254	” Her eyes filled with tears . “
85692	85709	85686	85686	I	0	” The words went through Campton like a sword , and he sprang to his feet . “
85733	85734	85745	85745	....	340	” “
85774	85775	85763	85763	he	983	” “
85909	85936	85902	85902	they	2091	” He stopped , checked by Mrs. Brant ’s pale bewildered face , and the eyes imploringly lifted , as if to ward off unintelligible words . “
85947	85951	85902	85902	they	2091	” he said ; “
85966	85975	85980	85980	you	2092	” He laid his hand on her shoulder . “
86000	86085	86086	86086	I	0	” He pocketed the letter and went out in search of Mr. Brant , followed by her gaze of perplexity . The latter was smoking a last cigar as he paced up and down the cloister with upturned coat - collar . Silence lay on the carefully darkened building , crouching low under an icy sea - fog ; at intervals , through the hush , the waves continued to mimic the booming of the guns . Campton drew out the orderly ’s letter . “
86106	86117	86099	86099	I	0	” he said . Mr. Brant had evidently expected him . “
86133	86134	86126	86126	she	255	” “
86148	86149	86156	86156	she	255	” “
86181	86185	86171	86171	she	255	” Campton shivered . “
86193	86194	86186	86186	She	255	” “
86214	86215	86211	86211	Julia	194	” “
86223	86224	86217	86217	you	2092	” “
86227	86232	86217	86217	you	2092	” Mr. Brant hesitated . “
86252	86253	86241	86241	I	0	” “
86263	86293	86295	86295	himself	2093	” Mr. Brant hesitated again . He had already , Campton felt , reached the utmost limit of his power of communicativeness . It was against all his habits to “
86297	86307	86295	86295	himself	2093	” Finally he said , in an unsteady voice : “
86318	86319	86295	86295	himself	2093	” “
86335	86336	86321	86321	she	255	” “
86356	86357	86343	86343	She	255	” “
86361	86365	86343	86343	She	255	” Campton murmured . “
86372	86384	86343	86343	She	255	” Mr. Brant held the letter , turning it thoughtfully about . “
86391	86405	86343	86343	She	255	” he began abruptly , as if the words were beyond his control , “
86426	86427	86417	86417	himself	175	” “
86432	86436	86417	86417	himself	175	” Campton considered . “
86457	86467	86470	86470	you	2092	” Mr. Brant put a hand in his pocket . “
86499	86517	86489	86489	I	0	” He drew two folded sheets from his note - case , and offered one to Campton . “
86523	86607	86489	86489	I	0	” The two men grasped hands through the fog . Mr. Brant turned to continue his round , and Campton went up to the whitewashed cell in which he was lodged . Screening his candle to keep the least light from leaking through the shutters , he re - read the story of George ’s wounding , copied out in the cramped tremulous writing of a man who never took pen in hand but to sign a daily batch of typed letters . The “
86611	86959	86489	86489	I	0	” copy of a letter by Mr. Brant represented something like the pious toil expended by a monkish scribe on the page of a missal ; and Campton was moved by the little man ’s devotion . As for the letter , Campton had no sooner begun to re - read it than he entirely forgot that it was a message of love , addressed at George ’s request to Mrs. Talkett , and saw in it only the record of his son ’s bravery . And for the first time he understood that from the moment of George ’s wounding until now he had never really thought of him in relation to the war , never thought of his judgment on the war , of all the unknown emotions , resolves and actions which had drawn him so many months ago from his safe shelter in the Argonne . These things Campton , unconsciously , had put out of his mind , or rather had lost out of his mind , from the moment when he had heard of George ’s wounding . By - and - bye , he knew , the sense of them , and of the questions they raised , would come back and possess him ; but meanwhile , emptied of all else , he brimmed with the mere fact of George ’s bodily presence , with the physical signs of him , his weakness , his temperature , the pain in his arm , the oppression on his lung , all the daily insistent details involved in coaxing him slowly back to life . The father could bear no more ; he put the letter away , as a man might put away something of which his heart was too full to measure it . Later — yes ; now , all he knew was that his son was alive . * * * * * But the hour of Campton ’s entering into glory came when , two or three days later , George asked with a sudden smile : “
86978	87074	86976	86976	Dad	332	” It was the first allusion , on the part of either , to the mystery of George ’s transit from the Argonne to the front . At Doullens he had been too weak to be questioned , and as he grew stronger , and entered upon the successive stages of his convalescence , he gave the impression of having travelled far beyond such matters , and of living his real life in some inconceivable region from which , with that new smile of his , he continued to look down unseeingly on his parents . “
87084	87089	87092	87092	he	2097	” the father thought . “
87107	87146	87095	87095	he	2097	” And then , one morning as they were taking a few steps on a sunny terrace , Campton had felt the pressure of the boy ’s sound arm , and caught the old George in his look . “
87164	87175	87158	87158	you	2100	” Campton could only stammer in reply . George laughed . “
87180	87208	87209	87209	I	0	” There was a long silence full of sea - murmurs , too drowsy and indolent , for once , to simulate the horror of the guns . “
87234	87239	87228	87228	you	2100	” the father continued . “
87307	87308	87302	87302	you	2100	” “
87314	87315	87302	87302	you	2100	” “
87320	87472	87302	87302	you	2100	” George ’s eyes turned from his and rested with a joyful gravity on the little round - faced Sister who hurried up to say that he ’d been out long enough . Campton often caught him fixing this look of serene benevolence on the people who were gradually repeopling his world , a look which seemed to say that they were new to him , yet dimly familiar . He was like a traveller returning after incommunicable adventures to the place where he had lived as a child ; and , as happens with such wanderers , the trivial and insignificant things , the things a newcomer would not have noticed , seemed often to interest him most of all . He said nothing more about himself , but with the look of recovered humanness which made him more lovable if less remotely beautiful , began to question his father . “
87487	87488	87483	87483	I	0	” “
87502	87503	87491	87491	I	0	” “
87506	87507	87504	87504	Portraits	342	” “
87523	87524	87516	87516	I	0	” “
87528	87529	87516	87516	I	0	” “
87562	87567	87557	87558	the dealers	1476	” George seemed unimpressed . “
87578	87579	87585	87585	they	1476	” “
87603	87613	87614	87614	You	247	” His son laughed , and then threw off : “
87619	87620	87616	87617	Mrs. Talkett	255	” “
87623	87631	87616	87617	Mrs. Talkett	255	” Campton snapped , off his guard . “
87638	87674	87632	87632	She	2106	” said George ; and at that moment his eyes , resting again on the little nurse , who was waiting at his door with a cup of cocoa , lit up with celestial gratitude . “
87685	88042	87632	87632	She	2106	” she cried ; and he smiled at her boyishly . The war was beginning to interest him again : Campton was sure that every moment he could spare from that unimaginable region which his blue eyes guarded like a sword was spent among his comrades at the front . * * * * * As the day approached for the return to Paris , Campton began to penetrate more deeply into the meaning of George ’s remoteness . He himself , he discovered , had been all unawares in a far country , a country guarded by a wingèd sentry , as the old hymn had it : the region of silent incessant communion with his son . Just they two : everything else effaced ; not discarded , destroyed , not disregarded even , but blotted out by a soft silver haze , as the brown slopes and distances were , on certain days , from the windows of the seaward - gazing hospital . It was not that Campton had been unconscious of the presence of other suffering about them . As George grew stronger , and took his first steps in the wards , he and his father were inevitably brought into contact with the life of the hospital . George had even found a few friends , and two or three regimental comrades , among the officers perpetually coming and going , or enduring the long weeks of agony which led up to the end . But that was only toward the close of their sojourn , when George was about to yield his place to others , and be taken to Paris for the re - education of his shattered arm . And by that time the weeks of solitary communion had left such an imprint on Campton that , once the hospital was behind him , and no more than a phase of memory , it became to him as one of its own sea - mists , in which he and his son might have been peacefully shut away together from all the rest of the world . XXVIII “
88045	88105	87632	87632	She	2106	” cried Boylston in an exultant crow . His round brown face with its curly crest and peering half - blind eyes beamed at Campton in the old way across the desk of the Palais Royal office ; and from the corner where she had sunk down on one of the broken - springed divans , Adele Anthony echoed : “
88108	88670	87632	87632	She	2106	” It was the first time that Campton had heard the word ; but the sense of it had been in the air ever since he and George had got back to Paris . He remembered , on the very day of their arrival , noticing something different in both Boylston and Miss Anthony ; and the change had shown itself in the same way : both seemed more vivid yet more remote . It had struck Campton in the moment of first meeting them , in the Paris hospital near the Bois de Boulogne — Fortin - Lescluze ’s old Nursing - Home transformed into a House of Re - education — to which George had been taken . In the little cell crowded with flowers — almost too many flowers , his father thought , for the patient ’s aching head and tired eyes — Campton , watching the entrance of the two visitors , the first to be admitted after Julia and Mr. Brant , had instantly remarked the air they had of sharing something so secret and important that their joy at seeing George seemed only the overflow of another deeper joy . Their look had just such a vividness as George ’s own ; as their glances crossed , Campton saw the same light in the eyes of all three . And now , a few weeks later , the clue to it came to him in Boylston ’s new word . _ Preparedness ! _ America , it appeared , had caught it up from east to west , in that sudden incalculable way she had of flinging herself on a new idea ; from a little group of discerning spirits the contagion had spread like a prairie fire , sweeping away all the other catchwords of the hour , devouring them in one great blaze of wrath and enthusiasm . America meant to be prepared ! First had come the creation of the training camp at Plattsburg , for which , after long delays and much difficulty , permission had been wrung from a reluctant government ; then , as candidates flocked to it , as the whole young manhood of the Eastern States rose to the call , other camps , rapidly planned , were springing up at Fort Oglethorpe in Georgia , at Fort Sheridan in Illinois , at The Presidio in California ; for the idea was spreading through the West , and the torch kindled beside the Atlantic seaboard already flashed its light on the Pacific . For hours at a time Campton heard Boylston talking about these training camps with the young Americans who helped him in his work , or dropped in to seek his counsel . More than ever , now , he was an authority and an oracle to these stray youths who were expending their enthusiasm for France in the humblest of philanthropic drudgery : students of the Beaux Arts or the University , or young men of leisure discouraged by the indifference of their country and the dilatoriness of their government , and fired by the desire to take part in a struggle in which they had instantly felt their own country to be involved in spite of geographical distance . None of these young men had heard Benny Upsher ’s imperious call to be “
88673	88802	89050	89050	you	2109	” from the first , no matter how or at what cost . They were of the kind to wait for a lead — and now Boylston was giving it to them with his passionate variations on the great theme of Preparedness . George , meanwhile , lay there in his bed and smiled ; and now and then Boylston brought one or two of the more privileged candidates to see him . One day Campton found young Louis Dastrey there , worn and haggard after a bad wound , and preparing to leave for America as instructor in one of the new camps . That seemed to bring the movement closer than ever , to bring it into their very lives . The thought flashed through Campton : “
88815	89045	89046	89046	Brant	194	” ; and once again a delicious sense of security crept through him . George , as yet , was only sitting up for a few hours a day ; the wound in the lung was slow in healing , and his fractured arm in recovering its flexibility . But in another fortnight he was to leave the hospital and complete his convalescence at his mother ’s . The thought was bitter to Campton ; he had had all kinds of wild plans — of taking George to the Crillon , or hiring an apartment for him , or even camping with him at the studio . But George had smiled all this away . He meant to return to the Avenue Marigny , where he always stayed when he came to Paris , and where it was natural that his mother should want him now . Adele Anthony pointed out to Campton how natural it was , one day as he and she left the Palais Royal together . They were going to lunch at a near - by restaurant , as they often did on leaving the office , and Campton had begun to speak of George ’s future arrangements . He would be well enough to leave the hospital in another week , and then no doubt a staff - job could be obtained for him in Paris—“with
89053	89097	89046	89046	Brant	194	” Campton concluded , hardly aware that he had uttered the detested phrase without even a tinge of irony . But Adele was aware , as he saw by the faint pucker of her thin lips . He shrugged her smile away indifferently . “
89145	89154	89123	89123	I	0	” Miss Anthony nodded and unfolded her napkin . “
89159	89165	89167	89167	he	416	” Campton continued his argument , “
89228	89234	89235	89235	Servants	2116	” His face lit up . “
89285	89286	89287	89287	You	0	” “
89297	89303	89287	89287	You	0	” said Miss Anthony concisely . “
89306	89307	89287	89287	You	0	” “
89327	89334	89318	89318	You	0	” she added with another pucker . “
89338	89339	89340	89340	I	0	” “
89355	89356	89350	89350	you	0	” “
89388	89389	89390	89390	He	175	” “
89396	89397	89390	89390	He	175	” “
89409	89485	89405	89406	Mrs. Talkett	255	” Miss Anthony frowned . The subject had been touched upon between them soon after Campton ’s return , but Miss Anthony had little light to throw on it : George had been as mute with her as with every one else , and she knew Mrs. Talkett but slightly , and seldom saw her . Yet Campton perceived that she could not hear the young woman named without an involuntary contraction of her brows . “
89492	89496	89490	89490	her	255	” she murmured . “
89500	89501	89497	89498	Mrs. Talkett	255	” “
89528	89534	89537	89537	women	738	” Campton said within himself : “
89541	89627	89537	89537	women	738	” For his own resentment had died out long ago . He could think of the affair now as one of hundreds such as happen to young men ; he was even conscious of regarding it , in some unlit secret fold of himself , as a probable guarantee of George ’s wanting to remain in Paris , another subterranean way of keeping him , should such be needed . Perhaps that was what Miss Anthony meant by saying that her liking Mrs. Talkett might be “
89630	89631	89537	89537	women	738	” “
89640	89645	89646	89646	He	2121	” the father persisted . “
89672	89677	89658	89658	I	0	” Miss Anthony smiled . “
89696	89697	89691	89691	you	0	” “
89706	89720	89703	89704	the Brants	203	” Campton glanced impatiently at the bill - of - fare , grumbled : “
89730	89735	89703	89704	the Brants	203	” and went on : “
89788	89795	89781	89781	I	0	” He stared moodily before him . “
89815	89845	89846	89846	You	0	” His companion still smiled , a little wistfully . She leaned over and laid her hand on his , under cover of the bill - of - fare . “
89871	89877	89883	89883	you	0	” Campton answered her smile . “
89885	90137	89883	89883	you	0	” he said ; and they began to lunch . * * * * * George was able to be up now , able to drive out , and to see more people ; and Campton was not surprised , on approaching his door a day or two later , to hear several voices in animated argument . The voices ( and this did surprise him ) were all men ’s . In one he recognized Boylston ’s deep round notes ; but the answering voice , flat , toneless and yet eager , puzzled him with a sense of something familiar but forgotten . He opened the door , and saw , at the tea - tray between George and Boylston , the smoothly - brushed figure of Roger Talkett . Campton had not seen Mrs. Talkett ’s husband for months , and in the interval so much had happened that the young man , always somewhat faintly - drawn , had become as dim as a daguerreotype held at the wrong angle . The painter hung back , slightly embarrassed ; but Mr. Talkett did not seem in the least disturbed by his appearance , or by the fact of himself being where he was . It was evident that , on whatever terms George might be with his wife , Mr. Talkett was determined to shed on him the same impartial beam as on all her other visitors . His eye - glasses glinted blandly up at Campton . “
90147	90170	90141	90141	I	0	” he began , going on with what he had been saying , but in a tone intended to include the newcomer . “
90206	90213	90201	90201	you	0	” Boylston emitted a faint growl . “
90223	90236	90201	90201	you	0	” he asked . Mr. Talkett ’s glasses slanted in his direction . “
90298	90307	90252	90253	my wife	3210	” said Mr. Talkett , straightening his glasses , “
90325	90353	90252	90253	my wife	3210	” Instinctively , he stretched a neat hand toward the teacups , as if he had been rearranging the furniture at one of his wife ’s parties . “
90361	90386	90389	90389	father	573	” Boylston stuttered , red with rage . George burst into a laugh . He seemed to take a boyish amusement in the dispute . “
90391	90410	90389	90389	father	573	” he suggested , reaching across the tray for a cigarette . Talkett jerked himself to his feet . “
90439	90441	90430	90430	me	0	” ( “
90446	90452	90456	90456	George	175	” Boylston interjected scornfully . ) “
90472	90487	90469	90470	old chap	2134	” Talkett continued , as he held the match deferentially to George ’s cigarette , “
90536	90542	90544	90544	his	1633	” he nodded at George , “
90551	90558	90559	90559	his	763	” with a slant at Campton , “
90652	90659	90664	90665	Mr. Campton	174	” he suddenly seemed to see his chance——“Well
90750	90751	90748	90748	he	259	” “
90757	90770	90771	90771	George	175	” shouted Boylston ; and Mr. Talkett ’s tallowy cheeks turned pink . “
90780	90800	90771	90771	George	175	” he stammered . George still laughed in his remote impartial way , and Boylston asked with a grin : “
90812	90819	90820	90820	I	0	” Mr. Talkett ’s pinkness deepened . “
90829	90838	90820	90820	I	0	” he began ; and George interrupted gaily : “
90880	90893	90895	90895	me	0	” Boylston rose also , and Campton remained alone with his son . “
90899	90960	90961	90962	Poor devil	456	” That was the way in which the modern young man spoke of his beloved to his beloved ’s proprietor . There had not been a shadow of constraint in George ’s tone ; and now , glancing at the door which had closed on Mr. Talkett , he merely said , as if apostrophizing the latter ’s neat back : “
90972	90973	90964	90964	He	456	” “
90977	90983	90964	90964	He	456	” asked Campton , startled . “
91026	91055	91017	91017	It	2153	” His eyes grew thoughtful . Was he going to pronounce Mrs. Talkett ’s name — at last ? But no ; he wandered back to her husband . “
91067	91073	91062	91062	he	247	” He shrugged his shoulders . “
91086	91087	91088	91088	Boylston	247	” “
91090	91091	91088	91088	Boylston	247	” “
91157	91158	91148	91148	them	2155	” “
91162	91163	91148	91148	them	2155	” “
91254	91264	91265	91265	You	2160	” George looked at his father with a smile . “
91306	91313	91314	91315	Old Adele	245	” He reached for another cigarette . “
91331	91389	91321	91321	you	2160	” he asked . XXIX Coming out of the unlit rainy March night , it was agreeable but almost startling to Campton to enter Mrs. Talkett ’s drawing - room . In the softness of shaded lamplight , against curtains closely drawn , young women dressed with extravagant elegance chatted with much - decorated officers in the new “
91391	91444	91445	91449	The Friends of French Art	3228	” uniform , with here and there among them an elderly civilian head , such as Harvey Mayhew ’s silvery thatch and the square rapacious skull of the newly - knighted patriot , Sir Cyril Jorgenstein . Campton had gone to Mrs. Talkett ’s that afternoon because she had lent her apartment to “
91451	91850	91445	91449	The Friends of French Art	3228	” who were giving a concert organized by Miss Anthony and Mlle . Davril , with Mme . de Dolmetsch ’s pianist as their leading performer . It would have been ungracious to deprive the indefatigable group of the lustre they fancied Campton ’s presence would confer ; and he was not altogether sorry to be there . He knew that George had promised Miss Anthony to come ; and he wanted to see his son with Mrs. Talkett . An abyss seemed to divide this careless throng of people , so obviously assembled for their own pleasure , the women to show their clothes , the men to admire them , from the worn preoccupied audiences of the first war - charity entertainments . The war still raged ; wild hopes had given way to dogged resignation ; each day added to the sum of public anguish and private woe . But the strain had been too long , the tragedy too awful . The idle and the useless had reached their emotional limit , and once more they dressed and painted , smiled , gossiped , flirted as though the long agony were over . On a sofa stacked with orange - velvet cushions Mme . de Dolmetsch reclined in a sort of serpent - coil of flexible grey - green hung with strange amulets . Her eyes , in which fabulous islands seemed to dream , were fixed on the bushy - haired young man at the piano . Close by , upright and tight - waisted , sat the Marquise de Tranlay , her mourning veil thrown back from a helmetlike hat . She had planted herself in a Louis Philippe armchair , as if appealing to its sturdy frame to protect her from the anarchy of Mrs. Talkett ’s furniture ; and beside her was the daughter for whose sake she had doubtless come — a frowning beauty who , in spite of her dowdy dress and ugly boots , somehow declared herself as having already broken away from the maternal tradition . Mme . de Tranlay ’s presence in that drawing - room was characteristic enough . It meant — how often one heard it nowadays!—that mothers had to take their daughters wherever there was a chance of their meeting young men , and that such chances were found only in the few “
91852	91994	91997	91997	she	2163	” houses where , discreetly , almost clandestinely , entertaining had been resumed . You had to take them there , Mme . de Tranlay ’s look seemed to say , because they had to be married ( the sooner the better in these wild times , with all the old barriers down ) , and because the young men were growing so tragically few , and the competition was so fierce , and because in such emergencies a French mother , whose first thought is always for her children , must learn to accept , even to seek , propinquities from which her inmost soul , and all the ancestral souls within her , would normally recoil . Campton remembered her gallant attitude on the day when , under her fresh crape , she had rebuked Mrs. Brant ’s despondency . “
92012	92046	92003	92003	she	2163	” he thought ; and just then he saw her turn toward Mme . de Dolmetsch with a stiff bend from the waist , and heard her say in her most conciliatory tone : “
92086	92121	92122	92122	We	2169	” Beckoned to by Mme . de Dolmetsch , Mr. Mayhew , all pink and silver and prominent pearl scarf - pin , bowed before the Tranlay ladies , while the Marquise deeply murmured : “
92131	92149	92150	92150	Mamma	344	” and Mademoiselle de Tranlay , holding him with her rich gaze , added in fluent English : “
92183	92184	92185	92186	Great women	2174	” “
92191	92265	92185	92186	Great women	2174	” Campton mused . He was still watching Mme . de Tranlay ’s dauntless mask when her glance deserted the gratified Mayhew to seize on a younger figure . It was that of George , who had just entered . Mme . de Tranlay , with a quick turn , caught Campton ’s eye , greeted him with her trenchant cordiality , and asked , in a voice like the pounce of talons : “
92322	92323	92316	92316	you	2166	” “
92327	92348	92316	92316	you	2166	” said Campton with satisfaction . The effect was instantaneous , though Mme . de Tranlay kept her radiant steadiness . “
92356	92364	92316	92316	you	2166	” And , after a proper interval : “
92387	92496	92378	92379	Mrs. Brant	196	” And she steered her daughter swiftly toward Julia . Campton ’s eyes returned to his son . George was still with Mrs. Talkett , but they had only had time for a word or two before she was called away to seat an important dowager . In that moment , however , the father noted many things . George , as usual nowadays , kept his air of guarded kindliness , though the blue of his eyes grew deeper ; but Mrs. Talkett seemed bathed in light . It was such a self - revelation that Campton ’s curiosity was lost in the artist ’s abstract joy . “
92506	92532	92533	92535	Poor little thing	2182	” he thought , reminded of having caught Mme . de Dolmetsch transfigured by fear for her lover ; but an instant later he remembered . “
92537	92555	92533	92535	Poor little thing	2182	” he murmured . Mrs. Talkett turned her head , as if his thought had reached her . “
92574	92590	92591	92591	George	175	” her eyes entreated him . But Mayhew and Sir Cyril Jorgenstein were between them . “
92593	92630	92591	92591	George	175	” Mrs. Brant called ; and across the intervening groups Campton saw his son bowing to the Marquise de Tranlay . Mme . de Dolmetsch jumped up , her bracelets jangling like a prompter ’s call . “
92633	92663	92591	92591	George	175	” she cried . The ladies squeezed into their seats , the men resigned themselves to door - posts and window - embrasures , and the pianist attacked Stravinsky .... “
92666	92675	92591	92591	George	175	” Campton heard his hostess answering some one . “
92729	92929	92943	92943	she	255	” Her smile appealed to her hearer to acknowledge the distinction . The music was over , and scanning the groups at the tea - tables , Campton saw Adele and Mlle . Davril squeezed away in the remotest corner of the room . He took a chair at their table , and Boylston presently blinked his way to them through the crowd . They seemed , all four , more like unauthorized intruders on the brilliant scene than its laborious organizers . The entertainment , escaping from their control , had speedily reverted to its true purpose of feeding and amusing a crowd of bored and restless people ; and the little group recognized the fact , and joked over it in their different ways . But Mlle . Davril was happy at the sale of tickets , which must have been immense to judge from the crowd ( spying about the entrance , she had seen furious fine ladies turn away ticketless ) ; and Adele Anthony was exhilarated by the nearness of people she did not know , or wish to know , but with whose names and private histories she was minutely and passionately familiar . “
93020	93075	93017	93018	the Duchess.——Ah	2189	” she broke off , abruptly signing to Campton . He followed her glance to a table at which Julia Brant was seating herself with the Tranlay ladies and George . Mayhew joined them , nobly deferential , and the elder ladies lent him their intensest attention , isolating George with the young girl . “
93078	93082	93017	93018	the Duchess.——Ah	2189	” Adele murmured , “
93129	93164	93110	93110	she	774	” Campton shrugged the subject away . Yes ; it would be a good thing if George could be drawn from what his mother ( with a retrospective pinching of the lips ) called his “
93168	93245	93110	93110	she	774	” But the idea that the boy might be coaxed into a marriage — and a rich marriage — by the Brants , was even more distasteful to Campton . If he really loved Madge Talkett better stick to her than let himself be cajoled away for such reasons . * * * * * As the second part of the programme began , Campton and Boylston slipped out together . Campton was oppressed and disturbed . “
93250	93269	93110	93110	she	774	” he said , taking Boylston ’s arm to steer him through the dense darkness of the streets ; “
93285	93289	93271	93277	these people who ’ve forgotten the war	2194	” Boylston laughed . “
93295	93331	93271	93277	these people who ’ve forgotten the war	2194	” He seemed preoccupied and communicative , and the painter fancied he was going to lead the talk , as usual , to Preparedness and America ’s intervention ; but after a pause he said : “
93343	93344	93332	93332	You	0	” “
93347	93351	93332	93332	You	0	” Campton interrupted . “
93376	93377	93371	93371	you	0	” “
93417	93418	93419	93419	You	2499	” “
93423	93463	93419	93419	You	2499	” Yes ; he was — and so , he added , was Miss Anthony . The trouble was , he went on to explain , that Mr. Mayhew , after months of total indifference ( except when asked to “
93465	93477	93478	93482	The Friends of French Art	3228	” them on official platforms ) had developed a disquieting interest in “
93484	93550	93551	93552	Atrocities ”	4461	” He had brought them , in the beginning , a certain amount of money ( none of which came out of his own pocket ) , and in consequence had been imprudently put on the Financial Committee , so that he had a voice in the disposal of funds , though till lately he had never made it heard . But now , apparently , “
93552	93568	93569	93573	The Friends of French Art	3228	” were losing their novelty , and he was disposed to transfer his whole attention to “
93575	93602	93569	93573	The Friends of French Art	3228	” with results which seemed incomprehensibly disturbing to Boylston , until he let drop the name of Mme . de Dolmetsch . Campton exclaimed at it . “
93664	93801	93653	93653	she	179	” and Boylston outlined the situation which his astuteness had detected while it developed unperceived under Campton ’s dreaming eyes . Mr. Mayhew was attending all their meetings now , finding fault , criticizing , asking to have the accounts investigated , though they had always been audited at regular intervals by expert accountants ; and all this zeal originated in the desire to put Mme . de Dolmetsch in Miss Anthony ’s place , on the plea that her greater social experience , her gift of attracting and interesting , would bring in immense sums of money — whereas , Boylston grimly hinted , they already had a large balance in the bank , and it was with an eye to that balance that Mme . de Dolmetsch was forcing Mayhew to press her claim . “
93875	93885	93888	93888	you	2499	” Campton stopped short , releasing Boylston ’s arm . “
93893	93897	93888	93888	you	2499	” he exclaimed . “
93904	93914	93900	93900	I	0	” But the young man ’s voice remained steady . “
93931	93932	93933	93933	I	0	” “
93955	93965	93949	93949	You	2499	” He felt Boylston ’s grin through the darkness . “
93977	93978	93979	93979	You	2499	” “
93988	93989	93985	93985	you	2499	” “
94031	94032	94025	94026	Miss Anthony	221	” “
94038	94666	94035	94035	she	221	” Campton agreed . As he walked home his mind was burdened with Boylston ’s warning . It was not merely the affair itself , but all it symbolized , that made his gorge rise , made him , as Boylston said , sick to the point of wanting to chuck it all — to chuck everything connected with this hideous world that was dancing and flirting and money - making on the great red mounds of dead . He grinned at the thought that he had once believed in the regenerative power of war — the salutary shock of great moral and social upheavals . Yet he _ had _ believed in it , and never more intensely than at George ’s bedside at Doullens , in that air so cleansed by passion and pain that mere living seemed a meaningless gesture compared to the chosen surrender of life . But in the Paris to which he had returned after barely four months of absence the instinct of self - preservation seemed to have wiped all meaning from such words . Poor fatuous Mayhew dancing to Mme . de Dolmetsch ’s piping , Jorgenstein sinking under the weight of his international honours , Mme . de Tranlay intriguing to push her daughter in such society , and Julia placidly abetting her — Campton hardly knew from which of these sorry visions he turned with a completer loathing .... There were still the others , to be sure , the huge obscure majority ; out there in the night , the millions giving their lives for this handful of trivial puppets , and here in Paris , and everywhere , in every country , men and women toiling unweariedly to help and heal ; but in Mrs. Talkett ’s drawing - room both fighters and toilers seemed to count as little in relation to the merrymakers as Miss Anthony and Mlle . Davril in relation to the brilliant people who had crowded their table into the obscurest corner of the room . XXX These thoughts continued to weigh on Campton ; to shake them off he decided , with one of his habitual quick jerks of resolution , to get back to work . He knew that George would approve , and would perhaps be oftener with him if he had something interesting on his easel . Sir Cyril Jorgenstein had suggested that he would like to have his portrait finished — with the Legion of Honour added to his lapel , no doubt . And Harvey Mayhew , rosy and embarrassed , had dropped in to hint that , if Campton could find time to do a charcoal head — oh , just one of those brilliant sketches of his — of the young musical genius in whose career their friend Mme . de Dolmetsch was so much interested .... But Campton had cut them both short . He was not working — he had no plans for the present . And in truth he had not thought even of attempting a portrait of George . The impulse had come to him , once , as he sat by the boy ’s bed ; but the face was too incomprehensible . He should have to learn and unlearn too many things first — — At last , one day , it occurred to him to make a study of Mme . Lebel . He saw _ her _ in charcoal : her simple unquestioning anguish had turned her old face to sculpture . Campton set his canvas on the easel , and started to shout for her down the stairs ; but as he opened the door he found himself face to face with Mrs. Talkett . “
94669	94680	94685	94687	The old woman	483	” she began at once , in her breathless way , “
94707	94708	94705	94705	I	0	” “
94714	94748	94749	94749	I	0	” he echoed . She was very simply dressed , and a veil , drooping low from her hat - brim , gave to her over - eager face a shadowy youthful calm . “
94756	94772	94749	94749	I	0	” she questioned , almost timidly ; and as Campton let her pass she added : “
94808	94828	94799	94799	I	0	” She shook a bulging bag out of her immense muff , while Campton continued to stare at her . “
94839	94862	94829	94829	I	0	” he finally stammered , trying to push a newspaper over the disordered remains of his breakfast . She lifted interrogative eyebrows . “
94872	94873	94866	94866	I	0	” “
94885	94890	94879	94879	you	2210	” She looked surprised . “
94917	94927	94900	94905	the real head of the committee	2214	” Her eyes rested on him with renewed timidity . “
94938	94942	94900	94905	the real head of the committee	2214	” she asked . “
94951	95007	94945	94945	My	0	” He paused , increasingly embarrassed . What did she expect him to say next ? To thank her for having sent him the orderly ’s letter ? It seemed to him impossible to plunge into the subject uninvited . Surely it was for her to give him the opening , if she wished to . “
95012	95017	94945	94945	My	0	” she broke out . “
95052	95100	95101	95101	You	0	” Campton felt a confused stirring of relief and fear . All his old dread of scenes , commotions , disturbing emergencies — of anything that should upset his perpetually vibrating balance — was blent with the passionate desire to hear what his visitor had to say . “
95116	95132	95107	95107	you	0	” he faltered . She frowned in her anxious way and looked away from him . “
95142	95143	95137	95137	you	2210	” “
95150	95157	95148	95148	I	0	” He groped for a word . “
95171	95172	95178	95178	I	0	” “
95197	95214	95189	95190	Léonce Black	289	” The blood rushed to Campton ’s face . Suddenly he felt himself trapped and betrayed . “
95224	95233	95218	95218	You	2210	” The thought was somehow intolerable to him . “
95243	95248	95237	95237	you	2210	” Mrs. Talkett murmured . “
95259	95260	95261	95261	I	0	” “
95274	95299	95270	95270	your	0	” She glanced about her , dropped to a corner of the divan , and tossed off her hat with the old familiar gesture . “
95308	95315	95303	95303	I	0	” she pleaded . Campton nodded . “
95331	95347	95316	95316	I	0	” He reached for his pipe , struck a match , and slowly seated himself . “
95368	95384	95362	95362	He	2220	” she went on ; then she paused again and drew a long anxious breath . “
95409	95446	95406	95406	you	2210	” Campton looked at her with deepening wonder . This was more surprising than discovering her to be the possessor of the picture ; he had not expected deep to call unto deep in their talk . “
95455	95467	95447	95447	I	0	” he confessed . Her fidgeting eyes deepened and grew quieter . “
95477	95485	95468	95468	Your	0	” she sighed , half to herself . “
95500	95501	95488	95488	he	2220	” “
95517	95518	95511	95511	I	0	” “
95524	95547	95549	95549	he	2220	” She shrugged the word away with half a smile , as though such considerations belonged to a prehistoric order of things . “
95564	95565	95549	95549	he	2220	” “
95569	95653	95549	95549	he	2220	” Campton exclaimed . He sat staring at her as if the weight of his gaze might pin her down , keep her from fluttering away and breaking up into luminous splinters . George wanted her to get a divorce — wanted , therefore , to marry her ! His passion went as deep for her as that — too deep , Campton conjectured , for the poor little ephemeral creature , who struck him as wriggling on it like a butterfly impaled . “
95658	95708	95549	95549	he	2220	” he said at length ; and suddenly , in short inconsequent sentences , the confession poured from her . George , it seemed , during the previous winter in New York , when they had seen so much of each other , had been deeply attracted , had wanted “
95711	95932	95984	95984	he	2221	” and at once — and there had been moments of tension and estrangement , when she had been held back by scruples she confessed she no longer understood ( inherited prejudices , she supposed ) , and when her reluctance must have made her appear to be trifling , whereas , really it was just that she could n’t ... could n’t .... So they had gone on for several months , with the usual emotional ups - and - downs , till he had left for Europe to join his father ; and when they had parted she had given him the half - promise that if they met abroad during the summer she would perhaps ... after all .... Then came the war . George had been with her during those few last hours in Paris , and had dined with her and her husband ( had Campton forgiven her ? ) the night before he was mobilised . And then , when he was gone , she had understood that only timidity , vanity , the phantom barriers of old terrors and traditions , had prevented her being to him all that he wanted .... She broke off abruptly , put in a few conventional words about an ill - assorted marriage , and never having been “
95936	95977	95984	95984	he	2221	” and then , as if guessing that she was on the wrong tack , jumped up , walked to the other end of the studio , and turned back to Campton with the tears running down her ravaged face . “
95992	95996	95984	95984	he	2221	” she lamented . “
96013	96055	96003	96003	you	2221	” She nodded , wiped away the tears , and in so doing stole an unconscious glance at the mirror above the divan . Then , seeing that the glance was detected , she burst into a sort of sobbing laugh . “
96066	96080	96063	96063	I	0	” she stammered . Campton took no notice , and she went on : “
96106	96107	96111	96111	he	2221	” “
96114	96115	96111	96111	he	2221	” “
96133	96238	96240	96240	Talkett	255	” She pulled out a gold - mesh bag and furtively restored her complexion , as Mrs. Brant had once done in the same place . Campton sat still , considering . He had let his pipe go out . Nothing could have been farther from the revelation he had expected , and his own perplexity was hardly less great than his visitor ’s . Certainly it was not the way in which young men had behaved in his day — nor , evidently , had it been George ’s before the war . Finally he made up his mind to put the question : “
96242	96249	96240	96240	Talkett	255	” She burst out at once : “
96264	96265	96255	96255	I	0	” “
96270	96271	96255	96255	I	0	” “
96280	96288	96255	96255	I	0	” She paused with a deepening embarrassment . “
96309	96310	96302	96302	he	319	” “
96317	96318	96312	96312	you	0	” “
96394	96395	96378	96378	he	175	” “
96399	96429	96378	96378	he	175	” Campton groaned , not so much at the hopelessness of the case as at the hopelessness of quoting Meredith to her . After a while he said abruptly : “
96459	96485	96446	96446	you	272	” He had been half afraid of offending her : but she appeared to consider the question impartially , and without a shadow of resentment . “
96522	96528	96543	96543	Talkett	255	” Campton continued to ponder . “
96549	96554	96543	96543	Talkett	255	” She looked frightened . “
96561	96562	96543	96543	Talkett	255	” “
96574	96595	96606	96606	you	0	” She examined the question with tortured eyebrows , and at length , to Campton ’s astonishment , brought out : “
96599	96600	96606	96606	you	0	” “
96617	96618	96606	96606	you	0	” “
96625	96655	96606	96606	you	0	” She seemed to need the assurance to restore her shaken self - approval . Campton rose with a movement of pity and laid his hand on her shoulder . “
96672	96682	96606	96606	you	0	” Her face fell , and she drew back . “
96726	96735	96736	96736	You	0	” She paused , and then broke out : “
96920	96921	96914	96914	I	0	” “
96951	96959	96947	96947	I	0	” She looked at him , disappointed . “
96968	96969	96960	96960	You	0	” “
96977	96978	96972	96972	he	856	” “
96991	97034	96981	96981	he	856	” She pulled her hat down on her troubled brow , gathered up her furs , and took another sidelong peep at the glass . Then she turned toward the door . On the threshold she paused and looked back at Campton . “
97040	97044	97037	97037	you	2497	” she cried , “
97064	97110	97111	97111	You	2497	” Campton ’s heart gave an angry leap ; for a second he felt the impulse to strike her , to catch her by the shoulders and bundle her out of the room . With a great effort he controlled himself and opened the door . “
97121	97656	97116	97116	you	2497	” she called back to him once again from the landing . * * * * * Madge Talkett had asked him to speak to his son : he had refused , and she had retaliated by planting that poisoned shaft in him . But what had retaliation to do with it ? She had probably spoken the simple truth , and with the natural desire to enlighten him . If George wanted to marry her , it must be ( since human nature , though it might change its vocabulary , kept its instincts ) , it must be that he was very much in love — and in that case her refusal would in truth go hard with him , and it would be natural that he should try to get himself sent away from Paris .... From Paris , yes ; but not necessarily to the front . After such wounds and such honours he had only to choose ; a staff - appointment could easily be got . Or , no doubt , with his two languages , he might , if he preferred , have himself sent on a military mission to America . With all this propaganda talk , was n’t he the very type of officer they wanted for the neutral countries ? It was Campton ’s dearest wish that George should stay where he was ; he knew his peace of mind would vanish the moment his son was out of sight . But he suspected that George would soon weary of staff - work , or of any form of soldiering at the rear , and try for the trenches if he left Paris ; whereas , in Paris , Madge Talkett might hold him — as she had meant his father to see . The first thing , then , was to make sure of a job at the War Office . Campton turned and tossed like a sick man on the hard bed of his problem . To plan , to scheme , to plot and circumvent — nothing was more hateful to him , there was nothing in which he was less skilled . If only he dared to consult Adele Anthony ! But Adele was still incorrigibly warlike , and her having been in George ’s secret while his parents were excluded from it left no doubt as to the side on which her influence would bear . She loved the boy , Campton sometimes thought , even more passionately than his mother did ; but — how did the old song go?—she loved honour , or her queer conception of it , more . Ponder as he would , he could not picture her , even now , lifting a finger to keep George back . Campton struggled all the morning with these questions . After lunch he pocketed Mrs. Talkett ’s moneybag and carried it to the Palais Royal , where he discovered Harvey Mayhew in confabulation with Mme . Beausite , who still trailed her ineffectual beauty about the office . The painter thought he detected a faint embarrassment in the glance with which they both greeted him . “
97694	97700	97682	97682	he	247	” Mr. Mayhew sardonically added . “
97766	97779	97780	97780	I	0	” Mr. Mayhew continued , as Campton appeared about to turn away , “
97839	97852	97830	97830	Beausite	176	” Mme . Beausite turned her great resigned eyes on the painter . “
97887	97901	97925	97925	you	943	” Campton ’s eyes returned her glance ; but he did not waver . “
97934	97972	97925	97925	you	943	” Mr. Mayhew ’s benevolent pink turned to an angry red . For a moment Campton thought he was about to say something foolish . But he merely bent his head stiffly , muttered a vague phrase about “
97976	98144	97925	97925	you	943	” and returned to his seat by Mme . Beausite ’s desk . As for Campton , his words had decided his course : he would take the money at once to Bullard and Brant ’s and seize the occasion to see the banker . Mr. Brant was the only person with whom , at this particular juncture , he cared to talk of George . XXXI Mr. Brant ’s private office was as glitteringly neat as when Campton had entered it for the first time , and seen the fatal telegram about Benny Upsher marring the order of the desk . Now he crossed the threshold with different feelings . To have Mr. Brant look up and smile , to shake hands with him , accept one of his cigars , and sink into one of the blue leather armchairs , seemed to be in the natural order of things . He felt only the relief of finding himself with the one person likely to understand . “
98149	98153	98146	98146	George	175	” he began . “
98156	98162	98146	98146	George	175	” said Mr. Brant briskly . “
98186	98187	98183	98183	you	2246	” “
98191	98244	98183	98183	you	2246	” said the father , slightly put off . He had not come to talk of birthdays ; nor did he need to be reminded of his son ’s by Mr. Brant . He concluded that Mr. Brant would be less easy to get on with in Paris than at the front . “
98279	98285	98296	98297	his mother	583	” the banker added tentatively . “
98333	98430	98431	98431	George	175	” It was doubtful if Mr. Brant had ever before made so long a speech , except perhaps at a board meeting ; and then only when he read the annual report . He turned pink and stared over Campton ’s shoulder at the panelled white wall , on which a false Reynolds hung . Campton meditated . The blush was the blush of Mr. Brant , but the voice was the voice of Julia . Still , it was probable that neither husband nor wife was aware how far matters had gone with Mrs. Talkett . “
98439	98448	98431	98431	George	175	” Campton said . Mr. Brant looked startled . “
98453	98454	98455	98455	He	175	” “
98469	98470	98461	98461	He	175	” “
98477	98499	98461	98461	He	175	” murmured Mr. Brant . He turned over a jade paper - cutter , trying its edge absently on his nail . “
98505	98516	98501	98501	Julia	194	” he began at length . Campton shook his head . “
98527	98607	98519	98519	I	0	” Mr. Brant gave his quick bow . He was evidently gratified , and the sentiment stimulated his faculties , as it had when he found that Campton no longer resented his presence at the hospital . His small effaced features took on a businesslike sharpness , and he readjusted his eye - glasses and straightened the paper - cutter , which he had put back on the desk a fraction of an inch out of its habitual place . “
98614	98618	98612	98612	George	175	” he asked . “
98659	98660	98655	98655	she	2250	” “
98669	98670	98655	98655	she	2250	” “
98679	98688	98655	98655	she	2250	” Mr. Brant appeared to seize the distinction . “
98695	98696	98689	98689	George	175	” “
98727	98755	98701	98702	his mother	583	” Mr. Brant ’s look seemed to say that making Julia understand had proved a no less onerous task for his maturity than for Campton ’s youth . “
98780	98784	98757	98757	you	0	” he suggested . “
98795	98799	98792	98792	I	0	” Campton pursued , “
98828	98843	98821	98821	She	2253	” He broke off , frightened at what he had been about to say . “
98847	98851	98821	98821	She	2253	” he emended , “
98877	98878	98880	98880	you	0	” “
98889	98890	98891	98891	She	2253	” “
98932	98997	98923	98923	She	2253	” Mr. Brant marked his sense of the weight of this by a succession of attentive nods . He put his hands in his pockets , leaned back , and tilted his dapper toes against the gold - trellised scrap - basket . The attitude seemed to change the pale panelling of his background into a glass - and - mahogany Wall Street office . “
99022	99023	99016	99016	you	0	” “
99063	99064	99053	99053	He	175	” “
99071	99089	99067	99067	he	175	” murmured Mr. Brant , impressed ; and Campton reflected that he had no doubt respected Julia . “
99106	99107	99092	99092	she	2253	” “
99115	99128	99092	99092	she	2253	” Mr. Brant sat up and dropped his heels to the floor . “
99134	99138	99092	99092	she	2253	” he snapped . “
99144	99145	99147	99147	her	2253	” “
99173	99181	99170	99170	you	0	” Mr. Brant exclaimed , almost impatiently . “
99301	99360	99293	99293	She	2261	” He threw it all out in sharp terse phrases , as a business man might try to hammer facts about an investment into the bewildered brain of an unpractical client . Campton felt the blood rising to his forehead , not so much in anger at Mr. Brant as at the sense of his own inward complicity . “
99376	99380	99367	99367	George	175	” he said . “
99443	99495	99496	99496	You	2264	” Campton looked over the banker ’s head at the reflection of the false Reynolds in the mirror . That any one should have been fool enough to pay a big price for such a patent fraud seemed to him as incomprehensible as his own present obtuseness seemed to the banker . “
99504	99510	99502	99502	you	2264	” argued Mr. Brant anxiously . “
99517	99555	99502	99502	you	2264	” Campton slowly got to his feet . The adroit brushwork of the forged picture fascinated him , and he went up to look at it more closely . Mr. Brant pursued him with a gratified glance . “
99593	99594	99513	99513	I	0	” “
99598	99641	99513	99513	I	0	” Campton assented dully . Mr. Brant seemed suddenly divided from him by the whole width of the gulf between that daub on the wall and a real Reynolds . They had nothing more to say to each other — nothing whatever . “
99646	99653	99513	99513	I	0	” He held out his hand . “
99662	99787	99513	99513	I	0	” Mr. Brant called out after him as he enfiladed the sumptuous offices , a medalled veteran holding back each door . It was not until Campton was back at Montmartre , and throwing off his coat to get into his old studio clothes , that he felt in his pocket the weight of the forgotten concert - money . It was too late in the day to take it back to the bank , even if he had had the energy to retrace his steps ; and he decided to hand the bag over to Boylston , with whom he was dining that night to meet the elder Dastrey , home on a brief leave from his ambulance . * * * * * “
99792	100152	99513	99513	I	0	” Mr. Brant ’s adjuration continued to echo in Campton ’s ears . As if he needed to be told to think it over ! Once again the war - worn world had vanished from his mind , and he saw only George , himself and George , George and safety , George and peace . They blamed women who were cowards about their husbands , mistresses who schemed to protect their lovers ! Well — he was as bad as any one of them , if it came to that . His son had bought his freedom , had once offered his life and nearly lost it . Brant was right : at all costs they must keep him from rushing back into that hell . That Mrs. Talkett should be the means of securing his safety was bitter enough . This trivial barren creature to be his all — it seemed the parody of Campton ’s own youth ! And Julia , after all , had been only a girl when he had met her , inexperienced and still malleable . A man less absorbed in his art , less oblivious of the daily material details of life , might conceivably have made something of her . But this little creature , with her farrago of false ideas , her vanity , her restlessness , her undisguised desire to keep George and yet not lose her world , had probably reached the term of her development , and would trip on through an eternal infancy of fads and frenzies . Luckily , as Mr. Brant said , they could use her for the time ; use her better , no doubt , than had she been a more finely tempered instrument . Campton was still pondering on these things as he set out for the restaurant where he had agreed to meet Boylston and Dastrey . At the foot of his own stairs he was surprised to run against Boylston under the porte - cochère . They gave each other a quick questioning look , as men did when they encountered each other unexpectedly in those days . “
100167	100178	100161	100161	you’ve	2267	” Campton remembered that he had left the bag upstairs . “
100192	100369	100187	100188	Louis Dastrey	209	” said Boylston . They stood side by side in the doorway , while Campton ’s darkened mind struggled anew with the mystery of fate . Almost every day now the same readjustment had to be gone through : the cowering averted mind dragged upward and forced to visualize a new gap in the ranks , and summon the remaining familiar figures to fill it up and blot it out . And to - day this cruel gymnastic was to be performed for George ’s best friend , the elder Dastrey ’s sole stake in life ! Only a few days ago the lad had passed through Paris , just back from America , and in haste to rejoin his regiment ; alive and eager , throbbing with ideas , with courage , mirth and irony — the very material France needed to rebuild her ruins and beget her sons ! And now , struck down as George had been — not to rise like George .... Once more the inner voice in Campton questioned distinctly : “
100375	100381	100187	100188	Louis Dastrey	209	” and again he answered : “
100386	100391	100392	100392	Paul	188	” Aloud he asked : “
100394	100395	100398	100398	he	188	” “
100416	100417	100398	100398	he	188	” “
100426	100427	100422	100422	Paul	188	” “
100430	100431	100422	100422	Paul	188	” “
100454	100499	100443	100443	he	188	” Boylston did not answer , and the two stood silent , looking out unseeingly at the black empty street . There was nothing left to say , nowadays , when such blows fell ; hardly anything left to feel , it sometimes seemed . “
100511	100666	100502	100502	I	0	” the older man said ; and arm in arm they went out into the darkness . When Campton returned home that night he sat down and , with the help of several pipes , wrote a note to Mrs. Talkett asking when she would receive him . * * * * * Thereafter he tried to go back to his painting and to continue his daily visits to the Palais Royal office . But for the time nothing seemed to succeed with him . He threw aside his study of Mme . Lebel — he hung about the office , confused and idle , and with the ever clearer sense that there also things were disintegrating . George ’s birthday party had been given up on account of young Dastrey ’s death . Mrs. Brant evidently thought the postponement unnecessary ; since George ’s return she had gone over heart and soul to the “
100670	100734	100502	100502	I	0	” party . But Mr. Brant quietly sided with George ; and Campton was glad to be spared the necessity of celebrating the day in such a setting . It was some time since Campton had seen his son ; but the fault was not his son ’s . The painter was aware of having voluntarily avoided George . He said to himself : “
100749	100798	100745	100745	I	0	” But in reality he did not feel himself to be fit company for any one , and had even shunned poor Paul Dastrey on the latter ’s hurried passage through Paris , when he had come back from carrying the fatal news to young Dastrey ’s mother . “
100814	100820	100803	100803	Paul	188	” Campton argued with himself . “
100864	100961	100962	100962	I	0	” But after one or two attempts he pushed away that canvas too . At length one afternoon George came in . They had not met for over a week , and as George ’s blue uniform detached itself against the blurred tapestries of the studio , the north light modelling the fresh curves of his face , the father ’s heart gave a leap of pride . His son had never seemed to him so young and strong and vivid . George , with a sudden blush , took his hand in a long pressure . “
101009	101036	100992	100992	She	282	” Campton felt his colour rising ; but though his own part in the business still embarrassed him he was glad that the barriers were down . “
101042	101052	100992	100992	She	282	” George continued , still flushed and slightly constrained , “
101079	101080	101081	101081	She	282	” “
101085	101086	101081	101081	She	282	” “
101175	101211	101165	101165	you	332	” They were seated now , the littered table between them . Campton , his elbows on it , his chin on his hands , looked across at his son , who faced the light . “
101218	101247	101165	101165	you	332	” he questioned . George smiled : it was exactly the same detached smile which he used to shed on the little nurse who brought him his cocoa . “
101259	101278	101317	101317	you	332	” He let the words fall as carelessly as if there were nothing in them to challenge attention . “
101282	101315	101317	101317	you	332	” Campton stared at him with a blank countenance . Had he heard aright ? The noise of a passing lorry suddenly roared in his ears like the guns of the front . “
101325	101333	101317	101317	you	332	” George opened his blue eyes wide . “
101355	101356	101348	101348	You	332	” “
101387	101398	101359	101359	you	332	” The same detached smile again brushed George ’s lips . “
101409	101410	101401	101401	I	0	” “
101425	101426	101415	101415	they	2281	” “
101442	101443	101415	101415	they	2281	” “
101453	101534	101535	101536	A man	2492	” Campton , breaking off on a sharp breath , closed his lids for a second . He had been gazing too steadily into George ’s eyes , and now at last he knew what that mysterious look in them meant . It was Benny Upsher ’s look , of course — inaccessible to reason , beyond reason , belonging to other spaces , other weights and measures , over the edge , somehow , of the tangible calculable world .... “
101550	101562	101545	101545	you	332	” he growled . But George insisted with his gentle obstinacy : “
101574	101580	101563	101563	You	332	” Campton shook his head . “
101586	101587	101588	101588	You	332	” “
101632	101633	101623	101623	I’ve	0	” “
101646	101653	101635	101635	you	332	” his father broke in violently . “
101686	101731	101680	101680	George	175	” George , in his long months of illness , had lost his old ruddiness of complexion . At his father ’s challenge the blood again rose the more visibly to his still - gaunt cheeks and white forehead : he was evidently struck . “
101742	101746	101732	101732	You	332	” Campton stormed . “
101776	101783	101788	101788	I	0	” the young man haltingly added , “
101802	101806	101810	101810	mother	821	” he acknowledged , “
101812	101823	101799	101799	Madge	282	” The blood flowed slowly back to Campton ’s heart . “
101961	101972	101941	101941	You	332	” George laid a hand on his a little wistfully . “
101980	101981	101982	101982	I	0	” “
102005	102040	102003	102003	Adele	220	” George sat staring down at the table . For the first time since they had met at Doullens Campton was conscious of reaching his son ’s inner mind , and of influencing it . “
102049	102068	102003	102003	Adele	220	” he suddenly risked . The question did not seem to offend George , scarcely to surprise him . “
102072	102077	102003	102003	Adele	220	” he said simply . “
102128	102129	102123	102123	They	2294	” “
102140	102180	102123	102123	They	2294	” Campton said , thinking that everything was different indeed , as he recalled the reasons young men had had for loving and marrying in his own time . A faint look of amusement came into George ’s eyes . “
102299	102706	102295	102297	the sacred humbug	2298	” He rose listlessly , as if the discussion had bled all the life out of him , and took himself away . When he had gone his father drew a deep breath . Yes — the boy would stay in Paris ; he would almost certainly stay ; for the present , at any rate . And people were still prophesying that in the spring there would be a big push all along the line ; and after that the nightmare might be over . Campton was glad he had gone to see Madge Talkett . He was glad , above all , that if the thing had to be done it was over , and that , by Madge ’s wish , no one was to know of what had passed between them . It was a distinct relief , in spite of what he had suggested to George , not to have to carry that particular problem to Adele Anthony or Boylston . A few days later George accepted a staff - appointment in Paris . BOOK IV XXXII Heavily the weeks went by . The world continued to roar on through smoke and flame , and contrasted with that headlong race was the slow dragging lapse of hours and days to those who had to wait on events inactively . When Campton met Paul Dastrey for the first time after the death of the latter ’s nephew , the two men exchanged a long hand - clasp and then sat silent . As Campton had felt from the first , there was nothing left for them to say to each other . If young men like Louis Dastrey must continue to be sacrificed by hundreds of thousands to save their country , for whom was the country being saved ? Was it for the wasp - waisted youths in sham uniforms who haunted the reawakening hotels and restaurants , in the frequent intervals between their ambulance trips to safe distances from the front ? Or for the elderly men like Dastrey and Campton , who could only sit facing each other with the spectre of the lost between them ? Young Dastrey , young Fortin - Lescluze , René Davril , Benny Upsher — and how many hundreds more each day ! And not even a child left by most of them , to carry on the faith they had died for .... “
102740	102759	102732	102732	God	266	” Campton questioned . Dastrey sat looking at the ground , his grey head bent between his hands . “
102762	102766	102732	102732	God	266	” he said . “
102776	102777	102780	102780	I	0	” “
102786	102787	102780	102780	I	0	” “
102794	103228	102790	102790	I	0	” Campton stood up heavily . An Idea : they must cling to that . If Dastrey , from the depths of his destitution , could still feel it and live by it , why did it not help Campton more ? An Idea : that was what France , ever since she had existed , had always been in the story of civilization ; a luminous point about which striving visions and purposes could rally . And in that sense she had been as much Campton ’s spiritual home as Dastrey ’s ; to thinkers , artists , to all creators , she had always been a second country . If France went , western civilization went with her ; and then all they had believed in and been guided by would perish . That was what George had felt ; it was what had driven him from the Argonne to the Aisne . Campton felt it too ; but dully , through a fog . His son was safe ; yes — but too many other men ’s sons were dying . There was no spot where his thoughts could rest : there were moments when the sight of George , intact and immaculate — his arm at last out of its sling — rose before his father like a reproach . The feeling was senseless ; but there it was . Whenever the young man entered the room Campton saw him attended by the invisible host of his comrades , the fevered , the maimed and the dying . The Germans had attacked at Verdun : horrible daily details of the struggle were pouring in . No one at the rear had really known , except in swift fitful flashes , about the individual suffering of the first months of the war ; now such information was systematized and distributed everywhere , daily , with a cold impartial hand . And every night , when one laid one ’s old bones on one ’s bed , there were those others , the young in their thousands , lying down , perhaps never to rise again , in the mud and blood of the trenches . Even Boylston ’s Preparedness was beginning to get on Campton ’s nerves . He tried to picture to himself how he should exult when his country at last fell into line ; but he could realize only what his humiliation would be if she did not . It was almost a relief , at this time , to have his mind diverted to the dissensions among “
103235	103907	103908	103908	I	0	” where , at a stormy meeting , Harvey Mayhew , as a member of the Finance Committee , had asked for an accounting of the money taken in at Mrs. Talkett ’s concert . This money , Mr. Mayhew stated , had passed through a number of hands . It should have been taken over by Mr. Boylston , as treasurer , at the close of the performance ; but he had failed to claim it — had , in fact , been unfindable when the organizers of the concert brought their takings to Mrs. Talkett — and the money , knocking about from hand to hand , had finally been carried by Mrs. Talkett herself to Mr. Campton . The latter , when asked to entrust it to Mr. Mayhew , had refused on the ground that he had already deposited it in the bank ; but a number of days later it was known to be still in his possession . All this time Mr. Boylston , treasurer , and chairman of the Financial Committee , appeared to think it quite in order that the funds should have been ( as he assumed ) deposited in the bank by a member who was not on that particular committee , and who , in reality , had forgotten that they were in his possession . Mr. Mayhew delivered himself of this indictment amid an embarrassed silence . To Campton it had seemed as if a burst of protest must instantly clear the air . But after he himself had apologized for his negligence in not depositing the money , and Boylston had disengaged his responsibility in a few quiet words , there followed another blank interval . Then Mr. Mayhew suddenly suggested a complete reorganization of the work . He had something to criticize in every department . He , who so seldom showed himself at the office , now presented a list of omissions and commissions against which one after another of the active members rose to enter a mild denial . It was clear that some one belonging to the organization , and who was playing into his hands , had provided him with a series of cleverly falsified charges against the whole group of workers . Presently Campton could stand it no longer , and , jumping up , suddenly articulate , he flung into his cousin ’s face a handful of home - truths under which he expected that glossy countenance to lose its lustre . But Mr. Mayhew bore the assault with urbanity . It did not behove him , he said , to take up the reproaches addressed to him by the most distinguished member of their committee — the most distinguished , he might surely say without offence to any of the others ( a murmur of assent ) ; it did not behove him , because one of the few occasions on which a great artist may be said to be at a disadvantage is when he is trying to discuss business matters with a man of business . He , Mr. Mayhew , was only that , nothing more ; but he _ was _ that , and he had been trained to answer random abuse by hard facts . In no way did he intend to reflect on the devoted labours of certain ladies of the committee , nor on their sympathetic treasurer ’s gallant efforts to acquire , amid all his other pressing interests , the rudiments of business habits ; but Miss Anthony had all along been dividing her time between two widely different charities , and Mr. Boylston , like his distinguished champion , was first of all an artist , with the habits of the studio rather than of the office . In the circumstances — — Campton jumped to his feet again . If he stayed a moment longer he felt he should knock Mayhew down . He jammed his hat on , shouted out “
103911	104247	103908	103908	I	0	” and limped out of the room . It was the way in which his encounters with practical difficulties always ended . The consciousness of his inferiority in argument , the visionary ’s bewilderment when incomprehensible facts are thrust on him by fluent people , the helpless sense of not knowing what to answer , and of seeing his dream - world smashed in the rough - and - tumble of shabby motives — it all gave him the feeling that he was drowning , and must fight his way to the surface before they had him under . In the street he stood in a cold sweat of remorse . He knew the charges of negligence against Miss Anthony and Boylston were trumped up . He knew there was an answer to be made , and that he was the man to make it ; and his eyes filled with tears of rage and self - pity at his own incompetence . But then he took heart at the thought of Boylston ’s astuteness and Miss Anthony ’s courage . They would not let themselves be beaten — probably they would fight their battle better without him . He tried to protect his retreat with such arguments , and when he got back to the studio he called up Mme . Lebel , and plunged again into his charcoal study of her head . He did not remember having ever worked with such supernatural felicity : it was as if _ that _ were his victorious answer to all their lies and intrigues .... But the Mayhew party was victorious too . How it came about a mind like Campton ’s could not grasp . Mr. Mayhew , it appeared , had let fall that a very large gift of money from the world - renowned philanthropist , Sir Cyril Jorgenstein ( obtained through the good offices of Mmes . de Dolmetsch and Beausite ) was contingent on certain immediate changes in the organization ( “
104250	104998	102790	102790	I	0	” was Mr. Mayhew ’s phrase ) ; and thereupon several hitherto passive members had suddenly found voice to assert the duty of not losing this gift . After that the way was clear . Adele Anthony and Boylston were offered ornamental posts which they declined , and within a week the Palais Royal saw them no more , and Paris drawing - rooms echoed with the usual rumours of committee wrangles and dark discoveries . The episode left Campton with a bitter taste in his soul . It seemed to him like an ugly little allegory of Germany ’s manœuvring the world into war . The speciousness of Mr. Mayhew ’s arguments , the sleight - of - hand by which he had dislodged the real workers and replaced them by his satellites , reminded the painter of the neutrals who were beginning to say that there were two sides to every question , that war was always cruel , and how about the Russian atrocities in Silesia ? As the months dragged on a breath of lukewarmness had begun to blow through the world , damping men ’s souls , confusing plain issues , casting a doubt on the worth of everything . People were beginning to ask what one knew , after all , of the secret motives which had impelled half - a - dozen self - indulgent old men ensconced in Ministerial offices to plunge the world in ruin . No one seemed to feel any longer that life is something more than being alive ; apparently the only people not tired of the thought of death were the young men still pouring out to it in their thousands . Still those thousands poured ; still the young died ; still , wherever Campton went , he met elderly faces , known and unknown , disfigured by grief , shrunken with renunciation . And still the months wore on without result . One day in crossing the Tuileries he felt the same soft sparkle which , just about a year earlier , had abruptly stirred the sap in him . Yes — it was nearly a year since the day when he had noticed the first horse - chestnut blossoms , and been reminded by Mme . Lebel that he ought to buy some new shirts ; and though to - day the horse - chestnuts were still leafless they were already misty with buds , and the tall white clouds above them full - uddered with spring showers . It was spring again , spring with her deluding promises — her gilding of worn stones and chilly water , the mystery of her distances , the finish and brilliance of her nearer strokes . Campton , in spite of himself , drank down the life - giving draught and felt its murmur in his veins . And just then , across the width of the gardens he saw , beyond a stretch of turf and clipped shrubs , two people , also motionless , who seemed to have the same cup at their lips . He recognized his son and Mrs. Talkett . Their backs were toward him , and they stood close together , looking with the same eyes at the same sight : an Apollo touched with flying sunlight . After a while they walked on again , slowly and close to each other . George , as they moved , seemed now and then to point out some beauty of sculpture , or the colour of a lichened urn ; and once they turned and took their fill of the great perspective tapering to the Arch — the Arch on which Rude ’s Mænad - Marseillaise still yelled her battalions on to death . XXXIII Campton finished his charcoal of Mme . Lebel ; then he attacked her in oils . Now that his work at the Palais Royal was ended , painting was once more his only refuge . Adele Anthony had returned to her refugees ; Boylston , pale and obstinate , toiled on at Preparedness . But Campton found it impossible to take up any new form of work ; his philanthropic ardour was exhausted . He could only shut himself up , for long solitary hours , in the empty and echoing temple of his art . George emphatically approved of his course : George was as insistent as Mrs. Brant on the duty of “
105003	105082	105083	105087	The Friends of French Art	3228	” But on the young man ’s lips the phrase had a different meaning ; it seemed the result of that altered perspective which Campton was conscious of whenever , nowadays , he tried to see things as his son saw them . George was not indifferent , he was not callous ; but he seemed to feel himself mysteriously set apart , destined to some other task for which he was passively waiting . Even the split among “
105088	105129	105130	105130	He	2306	” left him , despite of his admiration for Boylston , curiously unperturbed . He seemed to have taken the measure of all such ephemeral agitations , and to regard them with an indulgent pity which was worse than coldness . “
105140	105146	105147	105147	he	2306	” Campton said to Dastrey ; “
105183	105184	105187	105187	they	2310	” “
105193	105323	105187	105187	they	2310	” Dastrey murmured . * * * * * Mme . Lebel came up to the studio every afternoon . The charcoal study had been only of her head ; but for the painting Campton had seated her in her own horsehair armchair , her smoky lamp beside her , her sewing in her lap . More than ever he saw in the wise old face something typical of its race and class : the obstinate French gift , as some one had put it , of making one more effort after the last effort . The old woman could not imagine why he wanted to paint her ; but when one day he told her it was for her grandsons , her eyes filled , and she said : “
105337	105519	105331	105331	they	2312	” One autumn afternoon he was late in getting back to the studio , where he knew she was waiting for him . He pushed the door open , and there , in the beaten - down attitude in which he had once before seen her , she lay across the table , her cap awry , her hands clutching her sewing , and George kneeling at her side . The young man ’s arm was about her , his head pressed against her breast ; and on the floor lay the letter , the fatal letter which was always , nowadays , the key to such scenes . Neither George nor the old woman had heard Campton enter ; and for a moment he stood and watched them . George ’s face , so fair and ruddy against Mme . Lebel ’s rusty black , wore a look of boyish compassion which Campton had never seen on it . Mme . Lebel had sunk into his hold as if it soothed and hushed her ; and Campton said to himself : “
105566	105606	105543	105543	He	175	” But apparently there was no need to say much . George continued to kneel in silence ; presently he bent and kissed the old woman ’s cheek ; then he got to his feet and saw his father . “
105613	105628	105543	105543	He	175	” he merely said , picking up the letter and handing it to Campton . “
105638	105654	105655	105655	I	0	” Mme . Lebel caught sight of Campton , smoothed herself and stood up also . “
105699	105737	105697	105697	you	0	” She made an automatic attempt to straighten the things on the table , but her hands beat the air and George had to lead her downstairs . It was that day that Campton said to himself : “
105748	105924	105697	105697	you	0	” But the heavy weeks of spring and summer passed , the inconclusive conflict at the front went on with its daily toll of dead , and George still stuck to his job . Campton , during this time , continued to avoid the Brants as much as possible . His wife ’s conversation was intolerable to him ; her obtuse optimism , now that she had got her son back , was even harder to bear than the guiltily averted glance of Mr. Brant , between whom and Campton their last talk had hung a lasting shadow of complicity . But most of all Campton dreaded to meet the Talketts ; the wife with her flushed cheek - bones and fixed eyes , the husband still affably and continuously arguing against Philistinism . One afternoon the painter stumbled on them , taking tea with George in Boylston ’s little flat ; but he went away again , unable to bear the interminable discussion between Talkett and Boylston , and the pacifist ’s reiterated phrase : “
105932	106288	105697	105697	you	0	expressions”—while George , with a closed brooding face , sat silent , laughing drily now and then . What a different George from the one his father had found , in silence also , kneeling beside Mme . Lebel ! Once again Campton was vouchsafed a glimpse of that secret George . He had walked back with his son after the funeral mass for young Lebel ; and in the porter ’s lodge of the Avenue Marigny they found a soldier waiting — a young square - built fellow , with a shock of straw - coloured hair above his sunburnt rural face . Campton was turning from the door when George dashed past him , caught the young man by both shoulders , and shouted out his name . It was that of the orderly who had carried him out of the firing - line and hunted him up the next day in the Doullens hospital . Campton saw the look the two exchanged : it lasted only for the taking of a breath ; a moment later officer and soldier were laughing like boys , and the orderly was being drawn forth to shake hands with Campton . But again the glance was an illumination ; it came straight from that far country , the Benny Upsher country , which Campton so feared to see in his son ’s eyes . The orderly had been visiting his family , fugitives from the invaded regions who had taken shelter in one of Adele Anthony ’s suburban colonies . He had obtained permission to stop in Paris on his way back to the front ; and for two joyful days he was lodged and feasted in the Avenue Marigny . Boylston provided him with an evening at Montmartre , George and Mrs. Brant took him to the theatre and the cinema , and on the last day of his leave Adele Anthony invited him to tea with Campton , Mr. Brant and Boylston . Mr. Brant , as they left this entertainment , hung back on the stairs to say in a whisper to Campton : “
106319	106373	106375	106375	he	2749	” Campton nodded . For George ’s sake he was glad ; yet he could not repress a twinge of his dormant jealousy . Was it always to be Brant who thought first of the things to make George happy — always Brant who would alone have the power to carry them out ? “
106389	106484	106485	106485	Dad	332	” Campton thought almost savagely , as the young soldier beamed forth from the taxi in which George was hurrying him to the station . * * * * * It was not many days afterward that George looked in at the studio early one morning . Campton , over his breakfast , had been reading the _ communiqué _ . There was heavy news from Verdun ; from east to west the air was dark with calamity ; but George ’s face had the look it had worn when he greeted his orderly . “
106491	106515	106487	106487	I	0	” he said ; and sitting down at the table , he unceremoniously poured himself some coffee into his father ’s empty cup . “
106539	106574	106537	106537	we	2326	” His eye was clear , his smile confident : a great weight seemed to have fallen from him , and he looked like the little boy sitting up in bed with his Lavengro . “
106582	106597	106537	106537	we	2326	” he added , stretching his arms over his head with a great yawn . “
106604	106661	106537	106537	we	2326	” stammered Campton , not knowing what he said . Yet he was glad too ; yes , in his heart of hearts he knew he was glad ; though , as always happened , his emotion took him by the throat and silenced him . But it did not matter , for George was talking . “
106672	106678	106662	106662	I	0	” he said with animation . “
106706	106729	106730	106730	I	0	” Campton still gazed at him , struggling for expression . Their hands met . Campton said — or imagined he said : “
106740	106955	106730	106730	I	0	” though afterward he was not even sure that he had spoken . What he saw , with an almost blinding distinctness , was the extent to which his own feeling , during the long months , had imperceptibly changed , and how his inmost impulse , now that the blow had fallen , was not of resistance to it , but of acquiescence , since it made him once more one with his son . He would have liked to tell that to George ; but speech was impossible . And perhaps , after all , it did n’t matter ; it did n’t matter , because George understood . Their hand - clasp had made that clear , and an hour or two later they were lunching together almost gaily . Boylston joined them , and the three went on together to say goodbye to Adele Anthony . Adele , for once , was unprepared : it was almost a relief to Campton , who had winced in advance at the thought of her warlike attitude . The poor thing was far from warlike : her pale eyes clung to George ’s in a frightened stare , while her lips , a little stiffly , repeated the stock phrases of good cheer . “
107000	107344	107345	107346	Your mother	944	” It was the formula that sped every departing soldier . The day wore on . To Campton its hours seemed as interminable yet as rapid as those before his son ’s first departure , nearly two years earlier . George had begged his father to come in the evening to the Avenue Marigny , where he was dining with the Brants . It was easier for Campton nowadays to fall in with such requests : during the months of George ’s sojourn in Paris a good many angles had had their edges rubbed off . Besides , at that moment he would have done anything for his son — his son again at last ! In their hand - clasp that morning the old George had come back to him , simple , boyish , just as he used to be ; and Campton ’s dread of the future was lightened by a great glow of pride . In the Avenue Marigny dining - room the Brants and George were still sitting together about the delicate silver and porcelain . There were no flowers : Julia , always correct , had long since banished them as a superfluity . But there was champagne for George ’s farewell , and a glimpse of rich fare being removed . Mr. Brant rose to greet Campton . His concise features were drawn with anxiety , and with the effort to hide it ; but his wife appeared to Campton curiously unperturbed , and the leave - taking was less painful and uselessly drawn out than he had expected . George and his father were to be sent to the station in Mr. Brant ’s motor . Campton , as he got in , remembered with a shiver the grey morning , before daylight , when the same motor had stood at the studio door , waiting to carry him to Doullens ; between himself and his son he seemed to see Mr. Brant ’s small suffering profile . To shake off the memory he said : “
107363	107367	107358	107358	she	944	” George laughed . “
107388	107418	107421	107421	him	2334	” he added , with his all - embracing tolerance . Campton shivered again . That universal smiling comprehension of George ’s always made him seem remoter than ever . “
107434	107448	107421	107421	him	2334	” But he forced an acquiescent laugh , and presently George went on : “
107468	107469	107470	107472	My dear boy	977	” “
107474	107487	107470	107472	My dear boy	977	” There was another pause , and then Campton risked a question . “
107502	107522	107523	107523	I	0	” For a moment George seemed to hesitate : his thick fair eyebrows were drawn into a puzzled frown . “
107551	107558	107559	107559	I	0	” He paused and added quietly : “
107569	107570	107571	107571	You	0	” “
107576	107586	107571	107571	You	0	” Campton exclaimed with a great surge of relief . “
107616	107628	107603	107603	I	0	” The words thrust Campton back into new depths of perplexity . “
107632	107636	107603	107603	I	0	” he echoed . “
107790	107825	107782	107782	she	282	” Campton sat chilled and speechless as the motor whirled them on through the hushed streets . It paralyzed his faculties to think that in a moment more they would be at the station . “
107834	107840	107831	107831	your	2344	” he stammered at length . “
107845	107856	107831	107831	your	2344	” But he still felt the chill down his spine . “
107898	107899	107888	107888	We	2345	” “
107906	107916	107888	107888	We	2345	” Campton thought within himself . Aloud he said : “
107934	107935	107923	107923	you	2344	” “
107945	107972	107942	107943	old Dad	2349	” They were at the station . Father and son got out and walked toward the train . Campton put both hands on George ’s shoulders . “
107976	107981	107942	107943	old Dad	2349	” George broke out , “
108056	108080	108081	108081	My	0	” They clasped hands in silence , each looking his fill of the other ; then the crowd closed in , George exclaimed : “
108086	108208	108081	108081	My	0	” and somehow , in the confusion , the parting was over , and Campton , straining blurred eyes , saw his son ’s smile — the smile of the light - hearted lad of old days — flash out at him from the moving train . For an instant the father had the illusion that it was the goodbye look of the boy George , going back to school after the holidays . * * * * * Campton , as he came out of the station , stumbled , to his surprise , on Mr. Brant . The little man , as they met , flushed and paled , and sought the customary support from his eye - glasses . “
108217	108224	108209	108209	I	0	” he said , looking away . “
108231	108241	108227	108227	I	0	” Campton murmured ; then , with an effort : “
108253	108260	108227	108227	I	0	” Mr. Brant shook his head . “
108293	108319	108282	108282	I	0	” Together they strolled slowly across the station court to the place where the private motors waited ; but there Campton held out his hand . “
108329	108339	108323	108323	I	0	” Mr. Brant nodded ; then he said abruptly : “
108481	108491	108492	108492	I	0	” XXXIV The next morning Campton said to himself : “
108507	108734	108499	108499	I	0	” and pulled out a canvas before Mme . Lebel came in with his coffee . As sometimes happened to him , the violent emotions of the last twenty - four hours had almost immediately been clarified and transmuted into vision . He felt that he could think contentedly of George if he could sit down at once and paint him . The picture grew under his feverish fingers — feverish , yet how firm ! He always wondered anew at the way in which , at such hours , the inner flame and smoke issued in a clear guiding radiance . He saw — he saw ; and the mere act of his seeing seemed to hold George safe in some pure impenetrable medium . His boy was there , sitting to him , the old George he knew and understood , essentially , vividly face to face with him . He was interrupted by a ring . Mme . Lebel , tray in hand , opened the door , and a swathed and voluminous figure , sweeping in on a wave of musk , blotted her out . Campton , exasperated at the interruption , turned to face Mme . Olida . So remote were his thoughts that he would hardly have recognized her had she not breathed , on the old familiar guttural : “
108737	108754	108735	108735	Juanito	353	” He was less surprised at her intrusion than annoyed at being torn from his picture . “
108773	108777	108757	108757	you	2356	” he growled . “
108782	108786	108757	108757	you	2356	” she said ; “
108796	108797	108790	108790	I	0	” “
108816	108822	108810	108810	I	0	” Her large bosom rose . “
108872	108928	108866	108866	Juanito	353	” She sketched a plunging motion of her vast body , arrested it in time by supporting herself on the table , and threw back her head entreatingly , so that Campton caught a glint of the pearls in a crevasse of her quaking throat . He saw that her eyes were red with weeping . “
108939	108940	108934	108934	You	353	” “
108952	108967	108934	108934	You	353	” She leaned to him , absorbing his hands in her plump muscular grasp . “
109018	109067	109016	109016	Pepito	354	” And with a deep breath of pride and anguish she unburdened herself of her tale . Two or three years after her parting with Campton she had married a clever French barber from the Pyrenees . He had brought her to France , and they had opened a “
109070	109094	109101	109101	woman	4009	” at Biarritz and had prospered . Pepito was born there and soon afterward , alas , her clever husband , declaring that he “
109102	109104	109101	109101	woman	4009	” ( “
109118	109180	109117	109117	me	0	” ) , had gone off with the manicure and all their savings . Mme . Olida had had a struggle to bring up her boy ; but she had kept on with the Beauty Shop , had made a success of it , and not long before the war had added fortune - telling to massage and hair - dressing . “
109341	109358	109337	109337	I	0	” She pressed his hands with a smile of triumph ; then her face clouded again . “
109388	109414	109337	109337	I	0	” she sobbed , the tears making dark streaks through her purplish powder . The upshot of it was that she had heard that Campton was “
109418	109484	109337	109337	I	0	” ; that he knew Ministers and Generals , knew great financiers like Jorgenstein ( who were so much more powerful than either Generals or Ministers ) , and could , if he chose , help her to trace her boy , who , from the day of his departure for the front , had vanished as utterly as if the earth had swallowed him . “
109515	109523	109525	109525	your	0	” Campton looked at her , marvelling . “
109543	109563	109535	109535	you	0	” She returned his look with a tearful simplicity : she hardly seemed to comprehend what he was saying . “
109612	109613	109609	109609	you	0	” “
109619	109671	109616	109616	I	0	” he said ; and she took up her desperate litany , clinging about him with soft palms like medusa - lips , till by dint of many promises he managed to detach himself and steer her gently to the door . On the threshold she turned to him once more . “
109763	109866	109893	109893	she	2385	” Campton , guiding her across the sill , led her out and bolted the door on her ; then he went back to his easel and stood gazing at the sketch of George . But the spell was broken : the old George was no longer there . The war had sucked him back into its awful whirlpool — once more he was that dark enigma , a son at the front .... * * * * * In the heavy weeks which followed , a guarded allusion of Campton ’s showed him one day that Boylston was aware of there being “
109869	109875	109878	109878	he	2384	” George and Madge Talkett . “
109933	109934	109927	109927	she	2385	” “
109940	109950	109938	109938	George	175	” Boylston ’s round face became remote and mysterious . “
109975	109989	109971	109971	they	2389	” He drew up sharply on the word , but Campton faced it . “
109992	109993	109938	109938	George	175	” “
110017	110018	110021	110021	you	0	” “
110026	110031	110021	110021	you	0	” the father exclaimed . “
110059	110063	110056	110056	they	2389	” Campton nodded . “
110083	110084	110088	110088	he	175	” “
110227	110228	110209	110209	their	2390	” “
110231	110240	110209	110209	their	2390	” There was a pause before Campton questioned : “
110244	110245	110246	110248	Poor little ass	2154	” “
110280	110281	110265	110265	She	2395	” “
110293	110294	110286	110286	she	2395	” “
110323	110494	110314	110314	she	2395	” * * * * * Mrs. Brant continued to face life with apparent serenity . She had returned several times to Mme . Olida ’s , and had always brought away the same reassuring formula : she thought it striking , and so did her friends , that the _ clairvoyante ’s _ prediction never varied . There was reason to believe that George ’s regiment had been sent to Verdun , and from Verdun the news was growing daily more hopeful . This seemed to Mrs. Brant a remarkable confirmation of Olida ’s prophecy . Apparently it did not occur to her that , in the matter of human life , victories may be as ruinous as defeats ; and she triumphed in the fact — it had grown to be a fact to her — that her boy was at Verdun , when he might have been in the Somme , where things , though stagnant , were on the whole going less well . Mothers prayed for “
110497	110552	110314	110314	she	2395	sector”—and then , she argued , what happened ? The men grew careless , the officers were oftener away ; your son was ordered out to see to the repairs of a barbed wire entanglement , and a sharpshooter picked him off while you were sitting reading one of his letters , and thinking : “
110562	110679	110314	110314	she	2395	” And besides , Olida was _ sure _ , and all her predictions had been so wonderful .... Campton began to dread his wife ’s discovering Mme . Olida ’s fears for her own son . Every endeavour to get news of Pepito had been fruitless ; finally Campton and Boylston concluded that the young man must be a prisoner . The painter had a second visit from Mme . Olida , in the course of which he besought her ( without naming Julia ) to be careful not to betray her private anxiety to the poor women who came to her for consolation ; and she fixed her tortured velvet eyes on him reproachfully . “
110712	110748	110688	110688	Juanito	353	” He took her fraudulent hand and kissed it . The next afternoon he met Mrs. Brant walking down the Champs Elysées with her light girlish step . She lifted a radiant face to his . “
110830	110831	110819	110819	her	323	” “
110837	110838	110819	110819	her	323	” “
110934	110939	110940	110940	I	0	” Julia added gaily , “
110970	111279	110960	110960	I	0	” * * * * * Now and then Campton returned to his latest portrait of his son ; but in spite of George ’s frequent letters , in spite of the sudden drawing together of father and son during their last moments at the station , the vision of the boy George , the careless happy George who had ridiculed the thought of war and pursued his millennial dreams of an enlightened world — that vision was gone . Sometimes Campton fancied that the letters themselves increased this effect of remoteness . They were necessarily more guarded than the ones written , before George ’s wounding , from an imaginary H.Q. ; but that did not wholly account for the difference . Campton , in the last analysis , could only say that his vision of his boy was never quite in focus . Either — as in the moment when George had comforted Mme . Lebel , or greeted his orderly , or when he had said those last few broken words at the station — he seemed nearer than ever , seemed part and substance of his father ; or else he became again that beautiful distant apparition , the wingèd sentry guarding the Unknown . * * * * * The weeks thus punctuated by private anxieties rolled on dark with doom . At last , in December , came the victory of Verdun . Men took it reverently but soberly . The price paid had been too heavy for rejoicing ; and the horizon was too ominous in other quarters . Campton had hoped that the New Year would bring his son back on leave ; but still George did not speak of coming . Meanwhile Boylston ’s face grew rounder and more beaming . At last America was stirring in her sleep . “
111289	111383	111384	111384	My	0	” Boylston used to cry , as if his friend had been an army . His faith in George ’s powers of persuasion was almost mystical . And not long afterward Campton had the surprise of a visit which seemed , in the most unforeseen way , to confirm this belief . Returning to his studio one afternoon he found it tenanted by Mr. Roger Talkett . The young man , as carefully brushed and equipped as usual , but pale with emotion , clutched the painter ’s hand in a moist grasp . “
111401	111415	111388	111388	I	0	” Campton looked at him with apprehension . What was the meaning of his “
111417	111450	111384	111384	My	0	” ? Had Mrs. Talkett lost her head , and betrayed her secret — or had she committed some act of imprudence of which the report had come back to her husband ? “
111455	111480	111481	111481	My	0	” said the painter weakly . But his visitor , remaining sternly upright , shook his head and glanced at his wrist - watch . “
111484	111488	111384	111384	My	0	” he said , “
111509	111526	111527	111528	Your wife	2359	” He drew a handkerchief from his glossy cuff , and rubbed his eye - glasses . “
111530	111536	111527	111528	Your wife	2359	” Campton echoed , dismayed . “
111610	111611	111598	111598	I	0	” “
111615	111637	111598	111598	I	0	” gasped Campton , wringing his hand . * * * * * Boylston burst into the studio the next day . “
111712	111713	111704	111704	she	516	” “
111721	111725	111704	111704	she	516	” Campton cried . “
111741	111753	111730	111730	you	2499	” panted Boylston breathlessly . His face had caught the illumination . “
111783	111792	111793	111793	We	2420	” He flushed crimson and his eyes filled . “
111875	111876	111877	111877	They	2423	” “
111903	112007	111892	111892	you	2499	” Campton smiled ; and Boylston , choking back a sob , dashed off again . Yes , they were all being swept into it together — swept into the yawning whirlpool . Campton felt that as clearly as all these young men ; he felt the triviality , the utter unimportance , of all their personal and private concerns , compared with this great headlong outpouring of life on the altar of conviction . And he understood why , for youths like George and Boylston , nothing , however close and personal to them , would matter till the job was over . “
112015	112477	112478	112478	I	0	” he reflected whimsically . That afternoon , curiously appeased , he returned once more to his picture of his son . He had sketched the boy leaning out of the train window , smiling back , signalling , saying goodbye , while his destiny rushed him out into darkness as years ago the train used to rush him back to school . And while Campton worked he caught the glow again ; it rested on brow and eyes , and spread in sure touches under his happy brush . One day , as the picture progressed , he wavered over the remembrance of some little detail of the face , and went in search of an old portfolio into which , from time to time , he had been in the habit of thrusting his unfinished studies of George . He plunged his hand into the heap , and Georges of all ages looked forth at him : round baby - Georges , freckled schoolboys , a thoughtful long - faced youth ( the delicate George of St. Moritz ) ; but none seemed quite to serve his purpose and he rummaged on till he came to a page torn from an old sketch - book . It was the pencil study he had made of George as the lad lay asleep at the Crillon , the night before his mobilisation . Campton threw the sketch down on the table ; and as he sat staring at it he relived every phase of the emotion out of which it had been born . How little he had known then — how little he had understood ! He could bear to look at the drawing now ; could bear even to rethink the shuddering thoughts with which he had once flung it away from him . Was it only because the atmosphere was filled with a growing sense of hope ? Because , in spite of everything , the victory of Verdun was there to show the inexhaustible strength of France , because people were more and more sure that America was beginning to waken ... or just because , after too long and fierce a strain , human nature always instinctively contrives to get its necessary whiff of moral oxygen ? Or was it that George ’s influence had really penetrated him , and that this strange renewed confidence in life and in ideals was his son ’s message of reassurance ? Certainly the old George was there , close to him , that morning ; and somewhere else — in scenes how different — he was sure that the actual George , at that very moment , was giving out force and youth and hope to those about him . “
112493	112549	112485	112485	I	0	” Campton thought as he turned back to the easel . The little pencil sketch had given him just the hint he needed , and he took up his palette with a happy sigh . * * * * * A knock broke in on his rapt labour , and without turning he called out : “
112569	112622	112623	112623	He	0	” The door opened and Mr. Brant entered . He appeared not to have heard the painter ’s challenge ; his eyes , from the threshold , sprang straight to the portrait , and remained vacantly fastened there . Campton , long afterward , remembered thinking , as he followed the glance : “
112633	112677	112623	112623	He	0	” Mr. Brant moistened his lips , and his gaze , detaching itself from George ’s face , moved back in the same vacant way to Campton ’s . The two men looked at each other , and Campton jumped to his feet . “
112684	112703	112623	112623	He	0	” Mr. Brant tried to speak , and the useless effort contracted his mouth in a pitiful grimace . “
112709	112727	112728	112729	Not dead	2429	” Campton shrieked , catching him by the arm . The little man dropped into a chair . “
112738	112770	112623	112623	He	0	” was shaken out of him in jerks of anguish . The door burst open again , and Boylston dashed in beaming . He waved aloft a handful of morning papers . “
112787	112911	112912	112912	Your	2432	” His face turned white , and he stood staring incredulously from one of the two bowed men to the other . XXXV Campton once more stood leaning in the window of a Paris hospital . Before him , but viewed at another angle , was spread that same great spectacle of the Place de la Concorde that he had looked down at from the Crillon on the eve of mobilisation ; behind him , in a fresh white bed , George lay in the same attitude as when his father had stood in the door of his room and sketched him while he slept . All day there had run through Campton ’s mind the _ clairvoyante ’s _ promise to Julia : “
112929	113348	113349	113349	George	175	” Ah , this time it was true — never , never would he be sent to the front again ! They had him fast now , had him safe . That was the one certainty . Fast how , safe how?—the answer to that had long hung in the balance . For two weeks or more after his return the surgeons had hesitated . Then youth had seemed to conquer , and the parents had been told to hope that after a long period of immobility George ’s shattered frame would slowly re - knit , and he would walk again — or at least hobble . A month had gone by since then ; and Campton could at last trust himself to cast his mind back over the intervening days , so like in their anguish to those at Doullens , yet so different in all that material aid and organization could give . Evacuation from the base , now so systematically and promptly effected , had become a matter of course in all but the gravest cases ; and even the delicate undertaking of deflecting George ’s course from the hospital near the front to which he had been destined , and bringing him to Paris , had been accomplished by a word in the right quarter from Mr. Brant . Campton , from the first , had been opposed to the attempt to bring George to Paris ; partly perhaps because he felt that in the quiet provincial hospital near the front he would be able to have his son to himself . At any rate , the journey would have been shorter ; though , as against that , Paris offered more possibilities of surgical aid . His opposition had been violent enough to check his growing friendliness with the Brants ; and at the hours when they came to see George , Campton now most often contrived to be absent . Well , at any rate , George was alive , he was there under his father ’s eye , he was going to live : there seemed to be no doubt about it now . Campton could think it all over slowly and even calmly , marvelling at the miracle and taking it in .... So at least he had imagined till he first made the attempt ; then the old sense of unreality enveloped him again , and he struggled vainly to clutch at something tangible amid the swimming mists . “
113356	113401	113353	113353	George	175	” He used to say the name over and over below his breath , as he sat and watched at his son ’s bedside ; but it sounded far off and hollow , like the voice of a ghost calling to another . Who was “
113403	113530	113349	113349	George	175	” ? What did the name represent ? The father left his post in the window and turned back to the bed , once more searching the boy ’s face for enlightenment . But George ’s eyes were closed : sleep lay on him like an impenetrable veil . The sleep of ordinary men was not like that : the light of their daily habits continued to shine through the chinks of their closed faces . But with these others , these who had been down into the lower circles of the pit , it was different : sleep instantly and completely sucked them back into the unknown . There were times when Campton , thus watching beside his son , used to say to himself : “
113541	113608	113353	113353	George	175	me”—so deeply did George seem plunged in secret traffic with things unutterable . Now and then Campton , sitting beside him , seemed to see a little way into those darknesses ; but after a moment he always shuddered back to daylight , benumbed , inadequate , weighed down with the weakness of the flesh and the incapacity to reach beyond his habitual limit of sensation . “
113618	113687	113611	113611	they	2434	” he mused . By - and - bye , perhaps , when George was well again , and the war over , the father might penetrate into his son ’s mind , and find some new ground of communion with him : now the thing was not to be conceived . He recalled again Adele Anthony ’s asking him , when he had come back from Doullens : “
113696	113701	113693	113693	you	2436	” and his answering : “
113704	113814	113693	113693	you	2436	” ... Well , it was like that now : every vibration had ceased in him . Between himself and George lay the unbridgeable abyss of his son ’s experiences . * * * * * As he sat there , the door was softly opened a few inches and Boylston ’s face showed through the crack : light shot from it like the rays around a chalice . At a sign from him Campton slipped out into the corridor and Boylston silently pushed a newspaper into his grasp . He bent over it , trying with dazzled eyes to read sense into the staring head - lines : but “
113822	113847	113693	113693	you	2436	” was all that he could see . A nurse came gliding up on light feet : the tears were running down her face . “
113859	113927	113856	113856	I	0	” she exulted . Up the tall stairs and through the ramifying of long white passages rose an unwonted rumour of sound , checked , subdued , invisibly rebuked , but ever again breaking out , like the noise of ripples on a windless beach . In every direction nurses and orderlies were speeding from one room to another of the house of pain with the message : “
113935	113960	113693	113693	you	2436	” Campton and Boylston stole back into George ’s room . George lifted his eyelids and smiled at them , understanding before they spoke . “
113970	114006	114007	114007	You	2437	” Boylston cried over him in a gleeful whisper . The wounded man , held fast in his splints , contrived to raise his head a little . His eyes laughed back into Boylston ’s . “
114016	114351	114007	114007	You	2437	” he said ; and Boylston crimsoned . Campton turned away again to the window . The day had come — had come ; and his son had lived to see it . So many of George ’s comrades had gone down to death without hope ; and in a few months more George , leaning from that same window — or perhaps well enough to be watching the spectacle with his father from the terrace of the Tuileries — would look out on the first brown battalions marching across the Place de la Concorde , where father and son , in the early days of the war , had seen the young recruits of the Foreign Legion patrolling under improvised flags . At the thought Campton felt a loosening of the tightness about his heart . Something which had been confused and uncertain in his relation to the whole long anguish was abruptly lifted , giving him the same sense of buoyancy that danced in Boylston ’s glance . At last , random atoms that they were , they seemed all to have been shaken into their places , pressed into the huge mysterious design which was slowly curving a new firmament over a new earth .... There was another knock ; and a jubilant nurse appeared , hardly visible above a great bunch of lilacs tied with a starred and striped ribbon . Campton , as he passed the flowers over to his son , noticed an envelope with Mrs. Talkett ’s perpendicular scrawl . George lay smiling , the lilacs close to his pillow , his free hand fingering the envelope ; but he did not unseal the letter , and seemed to care less than ever to talk . After an interval the door opened again , this time to show Mr. Brant ’s guarded face . He drew back slightly at the sight of Campton ; but Boylston , jumping up , passed close to the painter to breathe : “
114366	114415	114007	114007	You	2437	” Campton went to the door and signed silently to Mr. Brant to enter . Julia Brant stood outside , flushed and tearful , carrying as many orchids as Mrs. Talkett had sent lilacs . Campton held out his hand , and with an embarrassed haste she stammered : “
114422	114914	114416	114416	We	2439	” Behind her he saw Adele Anthony hurriedly coming up the stairs . For a few minutes they all stood or sat about George ’s bed , while their voices , beginning to speak low , rose uncontrollably , interrupting one another with tears and laughter . Mr. Brant and Boylston were both brimming with news , and George , though he listened more than he spoke , now and then put a brief question which loosened fresh floods . Suddenly Campton noticed that the young man ’s face , which had been too flushed , grew pale ; but he continued to smile , and his eyes to move responsively from one illuminated face to the other . Campton , seeing that the others meant to linger , presently rose and slipping out quietly walked across the Rue de Rivoli to the deserted terrace of the Tuileries . There he sat for a long time , looking out on the vast glittering spaces of the Place de la Concorde , and calling up , with his painter ’s faculty of vivid and precise visualization , a future vision of interminable lines of brown battalions marching past . When he returned to the hospital after dinner the night - nurse met him . She was not quite as well satisfied with her patient that evening : had n’t he perhaps had too many visitors ? Yes , of course — she knew it had been a great day , a day of international rejoicing , above all a blessed day for France . But the doctors , from the beginning , must have warned Mr. Campton that his son ought to be kept quiet - very quiet . The last operation had been a great strain on his heart . Yes , certainly , Mr. Campton might go in ; the patient had asked for him . Oh , there was no danger — no need for anxiety ; only he must not stay too long ; his son must try to sleep . Campton nodded , and stole in . George lay motionless in the shaded lamplight : his eyes were open , but they seemed to reflect his father ’s presence without any change of expression , like mirrors rather than like eyes . The room was doubly silent after the joyful hubbub of the afternoon . The nurse had put the orchids and lilacs where George ’s eyes could rest on them . But was it on the flowers that his gaze so tranquilly dwelt ? Or did he see in their place the faces of their senders ? Or was he again in that far country whither no other eyes could follow him ? Campton took his usual seat by the bed . Father and son looked at each other , and the old George glanced out for half a second between the wounded man ’s lids . “
114924	114928	114416	114416	We	2439	” Campton grumbled . “
114937	114976	114932	114932	I	0	” his son smiled . No — he had n’t noticed ; he did n’t notice anything . He was a million miles away again , whirling into his place in the awful pattern of that new firmament .... “
114982	114989	114979	114980	old man	2440	” Campton asked under his breath . “
114995	115051	114979	114980	old man	2440	” said George contentedly . His father laid a hand on his and sat silently beside him while the spring night blew in upon them through the open window . The quiet streets grew quieter , the hush in their hearts seemed gradually to steal over the extinguished city . Campton kept saying to himself : “
115057	115131	115132	115132	Father	357	” and still not moving . The nurse was sure to come back presently — why should he not wait till she dismissed him ? After a while , seeing that George ’s eyes had closed , Campton rose , and crept across the room to darken the lamp with a newspaper . His movement must have roused his son , for he heard a slight struggle behind him and the low cry : “
115134	115163	114979	114980	old man	2440	” Campton turned and reached the bed in a stride . George , ashy - white , had managed to lift himself a little on his free elbow . “
115167	115172	114979	114980	old man	2440	” the father cried . “
115179	115338	114979	114980	old man	2440	” George said . He dropped back , his lids closing again , and a single twitch ran through the hand that Campton had seized . After that he lay stiller than ever . XXXVI George ’s prediction had come true . At his funeral , three days afterward , Boylston , a new - fledged member of the American Military Mission , was already in uniform .... But through what perversity of attention did the fact strike Campton , as he stood , a blank unfeeling automaton , in the front pew behind that coffin draped with flags and flanked with candle - glitter ? Why did one thing rather than another reach to his deadened brain , and mostly the trivial things , such as Boylston ’s being already in uniform , and poor Julia ’s nose , under the harsh crape , looking so blue - red without its powder , and the chaplain ’s asking “
115347	115686	114979	114980	old man	2440	” in the querulous tone of a schoolmaster reproaching a pupil who mislaid things ? It was always so with Campton : when sorrow fell it left him insensible and dumb . Not till long afterward did he begin to feel its birth - pangs .... * * * * * They first came to him , those pangs , on a morning of the following July , as he sat once more on the terrace of the Tuileries . Most of his time , during the months since George ’s death , had been spent in endless aimless wanderings up and down the streets of Paris : and that day , descending early from Montmartre , he had noticed in his listless way that all the buildings on his way were fluttering with American flags . The fact left him indifferent : Paris was always decorating nowadays for one ally or another . Then he remembered that it must be the Fourth of July ; but the idea of the Fourth of July came to him , through the same haze of indifference , as a mere far - off childish memory of surreptitious explosions and burnt fingers . He strolled on toward the Tuileries , where he had got into the way of sitting for hours at a time , looking across the square at what had once been George ’s window . He was surprised to find the Rue de Rivoli packed with people ; but his only thought was the instinctive one of turning away to avoid them , and he began to retrace his steps in the direction of the Louvre . Then at a corner he paused again and looked back at the Place de la Concorde . It was not curiosity that drew him , heaven knew — he would never again be curious about anything — but he suddenly remembered the day three months earlier when , leaning from George ’s window in the hospital , he had said to himself “
115714	116032	115694	115694	he	2444	” ; and that decided him to turn back . It was as if he had felt the pressure of George ’s hand on his arm . Though it was still so early he had some difficulty in pushing his way through the throng . No seats were left on the terrace , but he managed to squeeze into a corner near one of the great vases of the balustrade ; and leaning there , with the happy hubbub about him , he watched and waited . Such a summer morning it was — and such a strange grave beauty had fallen on the place ! He seemed to understand for the first time — he who had served Beauty all his days — how profoundly , at certain hours , it may become the symbol of things hoped for and things died for . All those stately spaces and raying distances , witnesses of so many memorable scenes , might have been called together just as the setting for this one event — the sight of a few brown battalions passing over them like a feeble trail of insects . Campton , with a vague awakening of interest , glanced about him , studying the faces of the crowd . Old and young , infirm and healthy , civilians and soldiers — ah , the soldiers!—all were exultant , confident , alive . Alive ! The word meant something new to him now — something so strange and unnatural that his mind still hung and brooded over it . For now that George was dead , by what mere blind propulsion did all these thousands of human beings keep on mechanically living ? He became aware that a boy , leaning over intervening shoulders , was trying to push a folded paper into his hand . On it was pencilled , in Mr. Brant ’s writing : “
116054	116288	116043	116043	you	2446	” Campton glanced down the terrace , saw where the little man sat at its farther end , and shook his head . Then some contradictory impulse made him decide to get up , laboriously work his halting frame through the crowd , and insert himself into the place next to Mr. Brant . The two men nodded without shaking hands ; after that they sat silent , their eyes on the empty square . Campton noticed that Mr. Brant wore his usual gray clothes , but with a mourning band on the left sleeve . The sight of that little band irritated Campton .... There was , as Mr. Brant had predicted , a long interval of waiting ; but at length a murmur of jubilation rose far off , and gathering depth and volume came bellowing and spraying up to where they sat . The square , the Champs Elysées and all the leafy distances were flooded with it : it was as though the voice of Paris had sprung up in fountains out of her stones . Then a military march broke shrilly on the tumult ; and there they came at last , in a scant swaying line — so few , so new , so raw ; so little , in comparison with the immense assemblages familiar to the place , so much in meaning and in promise . “
116305	116476	116479	116479	their	2448	” Campton thought ; and at the thought he felt a choking in his throat , and his sorrow burst up in him in healing springs .... * * * * * It was after that day that he first went back to his work . He had not touched paint or pencil since George ’s death ; now he felt the inspiration and the power returning , and he began to spend his days among the young American officers and soldiers , studying them , talking to them , going about with them , and then hurrying home to jot down his impressions . He had not , as yet , looked at his last study of George , or opened the portfolio with the old sketches ; if any one had asked him , he would probably have said that they no longer interested him . His whole creative faculty was curiously , mysteriously engrossed in the recording of the young faces for whose coming George had yearned . “
116496	116679	116479	116479	their	2448	” he said to Boylston , half - shamefacedly , as they sat together one August evening in the studio window . Campton seldom saw Boylston nowadays . All the young man ’s time was taken up by his job with the understaffed and inexperienced Military Mission ; but fagged as he was by continual overwork and heavy responsibilities , his blinking eyes had at last lost their unsatisfied look , and his whole busy person radiated hope and encouragement . On the day in question he had turned up unexpectedly , inviting himself to dine with Campton and smoke a cigar afterward in the quiet window overhanging Paris . Campton was glad to have him there ; no one could tell him more than Boylston about the American soldiers , their numbers , the accommodations prepared for their reception , their first contact with the other belligerents , and their own view of the business they were about . And the two chatted quietly in the twilight till the young man , rising , said it was time to be off . “
116685	116686	116479	116479	their	2448	” “
116708	116715	116698	116698	I	0	” Campton looked at him wistfully . “
116727	116728	116718	116718	I	0	” “
116732	116746	116718	116718	I	0	” cried Boylston , suffused with blushes ; and added with a laugh : “
116755	116756	116718	116718	I	0	” “
116774	116786	116770	116772	you young men	2452	” Boylston stood in the window twisting his cap about undecidedly . “
116803	116804	116794	116794	you	2499	” “
116807	116824	116825	116825	His	2454	” Campton interrupted suspiciously . The young man cleared his throat and spoke with a rush . “
116839	116840	116825	116826	His mother	583	” “
116857	116868	116846	116846	I	0	” Campton exploded . But Boylston stuck to his point . “
116901	116902	116892	116892	they	2457	” “
116931	116932	116936	116936	they	2457	” “
116948	116949	116951	116951	’em	2458	” “
116968	116969	116962	116962	He	2454	” “
116975	116976	116970	116971	Miss Anthony	221	” “
116989	116995	116985	116985	I	0	” Boylston seemed to hesitate . “
117082	117089	117078	117078	I	0	” Campton held out his hand . “
117110	117123	117078	117078	I	0	” he said . And on the threshold he called out sardonically : “
117140	117501	117502	117506	The Friends of French Art	3228	” * * * * * A monument — they wanted a monument ! Wanted him to decide about it , plan it , perhaps design it — good Lord , he did n’t know ! No doubt it all seemed simple enough to them : anything did , that money could buy .... When he could n’t yet bear to turn that last canvas out from the wall , or look into the old portfolio even .... Suffering , suffering ! What did they any of them know about suffering ? Going over old photographs , comparing studies , recalling scenes and sayings , discussing with some sculptor or other the shape of George ’s eyelids , the spring of his chest - muscles , the way his hair grew and his hands moved — why , it was like digging him up again out of that peaceful corner of the Neuilly cemetery where at last he was resting , like dragging him back to the fret and the fever , and the senseless roar of the guns that still went on . And then : as he ’d said to Boylston , who was to pay for their monument ? Even if the making of it had struck him as a way of getting nearer to his boy , instead of building up a marble wall between them — even if the idea had appealed to him , he had n’t a penny to spare for such an undertaking . In the first place , he never intended to paint again for money ; never intended to do anything but these gaunt and serious or round and babyish young American faces above their stiff military collars , and when their portraits were finished to put them away , locked up for his own pleasure ; and what he had earned in the last years was to be partly for these young men — for their reading - rooms , clubs , recreation centres , whatever was likely to give them temporary rest and solace in the grim months to come ; and partly for such of the protégés of “
117507	117742	117502	117506	The Friends of French Art	3228	” as had been deprived of aid under the new management . Tales of private jealousy and petty retaliation came to Campton daily , now that Mme . Beausite administered the funds ; Adele Anthony and Mlle . Davril , bursting with the wrongs of their pensioners , were always appealing to him for help . And then , hidden behind these more or less valid reasons , the old instinctive dread of spending had reasserted itself , he could n’t tell how or why , unless through some dim opposition to the Brants ’ perpetual outpouring : their hospitals , their motors , their bribes , their orchids , and now their monument—_their _ monument ! He sought refuge from it all with his soldiers , haunting for hours every day one of the newly - opened Soldiers ’ and Sailors ’ Clubs . Adele Anthony had already found a job there , and was making a success of it . She looked twenty years older since George was gone , but she stuck to her work with the same humorous pertinacity ; and with her mingled heartiness and ceremony , her funny resuscitation of obsolete American slang , and her ability to answer all their most disconcerting questions about Paris and France ( Montmartre included ) , she easily eclipsed the ministering angels who twanged the home - town chord and called them “
117745	117799	117800	117802	the old gentleman	2467	” The young men appeared to return Campton ’s liking ; it was as if they had guessed that he needed them , and wanted to offer him their shy help . He was conscious of something rather protecting in their attitude , of his being to them a vague unidentified figure , merely “
117803	118189	117800	117802	the old gentleman	2467	” who was friendly to them ; but he did n’t mind . It was enough to sit and listen to their talk , to try and clear up a few of the countless puzzles which confronted them , to render them such fatherly services as he could , and in the interval to jot down notes of their faces — their inexhaustibly inspiring faces . Sometimes to talk with them was like being on the floor in George ’s nursery , among the blocks and the tin soldiers ; sometimes like walking with young archangels in a cool empty heaven ; but wherever he was he always had the sense of being among his own , the sense he had never had since George ’s death . To think of them all as George ’s brothers , to study out the secret likeness to him in their young dedicated faces : that was now his one passion , his sustaining task ; it was at such times that his son came back and sat among them .... Gradually , as the weeks passed , the first of his new friends , officers and soldiers , were dispersed throughout the training camps , and new faces succeeded to those he had tried to fix on his canvas ; an endless line of Benny Upshers , baby - Georges , schoolboy Boylstons , they seemed to be . Campton saw each one go with a fresh pang , knowing that every move brought them so much nearer to the front , that ever - ravening and inexorable front . They were always happy to be gone ; and that only increased his pain . Now and then he attached himself more particularly to one of the young men , because of some look of the eyes or some turn of the mind like George ’s ; and then the parting became anguish . One day a second lieutenant came to the studio to take leave . He had been an early recruit of Plattsburg , and his military training was so far advanced that he counted on being among the first officers sent to the fighting line . He was a fresh - coloured lad , with fair hair that stood up in a defiant crest . “
118215	118269	118206	118206	they	2469	” he laughed . It was just the sort of thing that George would have said , and the laugh was like an echo of George ’s . At the sound Campton suddenly burst into tears , and was aware of his visitor ’s looking at him with eyes of dismay and compassion . “
118282	118508	118275	118275	sir	2499	” the young man pleaded , wringing the painter ’s hand , and making what decent haste he could to get out of the studio . * * * * * Campton , left alone , turned once more to his easel . He sat down before a canvas on which he had blocked out a group of soldiers playing cards at their club ; but after a stroke or two he threw aside his brush , and remained with his head bowed on his hands , a lonely tired old man . He had kept a cheerful front at his son ’s going ; and now he could not say goodbye to one of these young fellows without crying . Well — it was because he had no one left of his own , he supposed . Loneliness like his took all a man ’s strength from him .... The bell rang , but he did not move . It rang again ; then the door was pushed timidly open , and Mrs. Talkett came in . He had not seen her since the day of George ’s funeral , when he had fancied he detected her in a shrunken black - veiled figure hurrying past in the meaningless line of mourners . In her usual abrupt fashion she began , without a greeting : “
118522	118535	118275	118275	sir	2499	” He looked at her remotely , hardly hearing what she said . “
118539	118540	118275	118275	sir	2499	” “
118548	118567	118568	118568	He	922	” He continued to consider her in silence , and she frowned in her perplexed and fretful way . “
118576	118585	118568	118568	He	922	” Her eyes wandered unseeingly about the studio . “
118643	118649	118625	118625	he	922	” Campton still listened absently . “
118658	118673	118652	118652	you	0	” he agreed at length , supposing it was what she expected of him . “
118677	118683	118675	118675	I	0	” She half - smiled . “
118713	118722	118708	118708	George	175	” She stood uncertainly in front of Campton . “
118730	118742	118708	118708	George	175	” she cried , with a sharp break in her voice , “
118759	118813	118814	118814	I	0	” And she threw herself down on the divan in a storm of desolate sobbing . After he had comforted her as best he could , and she had gone away , Campton continued to wander up and down the studio forlornly . That cry of hers kept on echoing in his ears : “
118828	118846	118847	118847	You	2474	” It associated itself suddenly with a phrase of Boylston ’s that he had brushed away unheeding : “
118866	118978	118999	118999	Brant	194	” Yes ; Campton saw now that it was true of poor Madge Talkett , as it was of Adele Anthony and Mr. Brant , and even in a measure of Julia . They had never — no , not even George ’s mother — had anything , in the close inextricable sense in which Campton had had his son . And it was only now , in his own hour of destitution , that he understood how much greater the depth of their poverty had been . He recalled the frightened embarrassed look of the young lieutenant whom he had discountenanced by his tears ; and he said to himself : “
119005	119766	118999	118999	Brant	194	” Julia too : it was strange that his thoughts should turn to her with such peculiar pity . It was not because the boy had been born of her body : Campton did not see her now , as he once had in a brief moment of compassion , as the young mother bending illumined above her baby . He saw her as an old empty - hearted woman , and asked himself how such an unmanageable monster as grief was to fill the room up of her absent son . What did such people as Julia do with grief , he wondered , how did they make room for it in their lives , get up and lie down every day with its taste on their lips ? Its elemental quality , that awful sense it communicated of a whirling earth , a crumbling Time , and all the cold stellar spaces yawning to receive us — these feelings which he was beginning to discern and to come to terms with in his own way ( and with the sense that it would have been George ’s way too ) , these feelings could never give their stern appeasement to Julia .... Her religion ? Yes , such as it was no doubt it would help ; talking with the Rector would help ; giving more time to her church - charities , her wounded soldiers , imagining that she was paying some kind of tax on her affliction . But the vacant evenings , at home , face to face with Brant ! Campton had long since seen that the one thing which had held the two together was their shared love of George ; and if Julia discovered , as she could hardly fail to do , how much more deeply Brant had loved her son than she had , and how much more inconsolably he mourned him , that would only increase her sense of isolation . And so , in sheer self - defence , she would gradually , stealthily , fill up the void with the old occupations , with bridge and visits and secret consultations at the dressmaker ’s about the width of crape on her dresses ; and all the while the object of life would be gone for her . Yes ; he pitied Julia most of all . But Mr. Brant too — perhaps in a different way it was he who suffered most . For the stellar spaces were not exactly Mr. Brant ’s native climate , and yet voices would call to him from them , and he would not know .... There were moments when Campton looked about him with astonishment at the richness of his own denuded life ; when George was in the sunset , in the voices of young people , or in any trivial joke that father and son would have shared ; and other moments when he was nowhere , utterly lost , extinct and irrecoverable ; and others again when the one thing which could have vitalized the dead business of living would have been to see him shove open the studio door , stalk in , pour out some coffee for himself in his father ’s cup , and diffuse through the air the warm sense of his bodily presence , the fresh smell of his clothes and his flesh and his hair . But through all these moods , Campton began to see , there ran the life - giving power of a reality embraced and accepted . George had been ; George was ; as long as his father ’s consciousness lasted , George would be as much a part of it as the closest , most actual of his immediate sensations . He had missed nothing of George , and here was his harvest , his golden harvest . Such states of mind were not constant with Campton ; but more and more often , when they came , they swept him on eagle wings over the next desert to the next oasis ; and so , gradually , the meaningless days became linked to each other in some kind of intelligible sequence . * * * * * Boylston , after the talk which had so agitated Campton , did not turn up again at the studio for some time ; but when he next appeared the painter , hardly pausing to greet him , began at once , as if they had just parted : “
119779	119787	119769	119769	you	2478	” Boylston glanced at him in surprise . “
119801	119898	119789	119789	they	2479	” Campton went on , jerking the words out abruptly and walking away toward the window . He had not known , till he began , that he had meant to utter them , or how difficult they would be to say ; and he stood there a moment struggling with the unreasoning rebellious irritability which so often lay in wait for his better impulses . At length he turned back , his hands in his pockets , clinking his change as he had done the first time that Boylston had come to him for help . “
