If I had gone this walk with Jenny , I wonder whether I should have felt as I do now . There must be something wrong in me , myself , to feel so guilty when I have done nothing which is not right ; and yet I can thank God for the happiness I have had in this charming spring walk , which dear mamma used to say was a sign when pleasures were innocent and good for us .

I can quite fancy that charming home at Milham you told me about last Sunday . I can almost fancy Mrs Mason 's workroom ; and that , surely , is a proof either of the strength of my imagination , or of your powers of description . "
17278	17313	17275	17275	Ruth	81	" It is , indeed , sir . Our workroom must be so different to anything you ever saw . I think you must have passed through Milham often on your way to Lowford . "

She thought it right to treat that poor girl Palmer in the way you told me about . You would think that wrong , you know , and so would every one of sense and feeling . Come , Ruth , do n't pin your faith on any one , but judge for yourself . The pleasure is perfectly innocent ; it is not a selfish pleasure either , for I shall enjoy it to the full as much as you will .

Mamma was very fond of him too .

Now , what I advise is this . Come with me into this little inn ; I will order tea for you--(I am sure you require it sadly)--and I will leave you there , and go home for the carriage .

Yesterday , when everything was gloomy , and you might have been aware that I was out of spirits , I heard nothing but expressions of delight ; to - day , when every creature under heaven is rejoicing , you look most deplorable and woe - begone . You really should learn to have a little sympathy . "

Not but what I 'm sorry for her , for she 's an innocent , inoffensive young creature . I always think it right , for my own morals , to put a little scorn into my manners when such as her come to stay here ; but , indeed , she 's so gentle , I 've found it hard work to show the proper contempt .

32851	32972	32781	32781	she	81	" Indeed and I have . His mother , as haughty a lady as you would wish to see , came travelling through Wales last year ; she stopped here , and , I warrant you , nothing was good enough for her ; she was real quality . She left some clothes and books behind her ( for the maid was almost as fine as the mistress , and little thought of seeing after her lady 's clothes , having a taste for going to see scenery along with the man - servant ) , and we had several letters from her . I have them locked in the drawers in the bar , where I keep such things . "

33668	33781	33782	33782	Ruth	81	" No , indeed , that you may not . Nest , who has made his room tidy these many days , is not fit to go in now . Mrs Bellingham has brought her own maid , and the family nurse , and Mr Bellingham 's man ; such a tribe of servants and no end to packages ; water - beds coming by the carrier , and a doctor from London coming down to - morrow , as if feather - beds and Mr Jones was not good enough . Why , she wo n't let a soul of us into the room ; there 's no chance for you ! "

Mr Jones said to - night was a turning point ; but I doubt it , for it is four days since he was taken ill , and who ever heard of a sick person taking a turn on an even number of days ; it 's always on the third , or the fifth , or seventh , or so on . He 'll not turn till to - morrow night , take my word for it , and their fine London doctor will get all the credit , and honest Mr Jones will be thrown aside . I do n't think he will get better myself , though -- Gelert does not howl for nothing . My patience ! what 's the matter with the girl?--lord , child , you 're never going to faint , and be ill on my hands ? "

35966	36086	36087	36087	Ruth	81	" Indeed , miss , and you must not hang about the door in this way ; it is not pretty manners . Mrs Bellingham has been speaking very sharp and cross about it , and I shall lose the character of my inn if people take to talking as she does . Did not I give you a room last night to keep in , and never be seen or heard of ; and did I not tell you what a particular lady Mrs Bellingham was , but you must come out here right in her way ? Indeed , it was not pretty , nor grateful to me , Jenny Morgan , and that I must say . "

I 'll send you your breakfast by - and - by , and let you know from time to time how he is ; and you can go out for a walk , you know ; but if you do , I 'll take it as a favour if you 'll go out by the side door . It will , maybe , save scandal . "

36851	36934	36848	36848	she	96	" it was my wish to be as blind to the whole affair as possible , though you ca n't imagine how Mrs Mason has blazoned it abroad ; all Fordham rings with it ; but of course it could not be pleasant , or , indeed , I may say correct , for me to be aware that a person of such improper character was under the same -- I beg your pardon , dear Henry , what do you say ? "
36935	36949	36848	36848	she	96	" Ruth is no improper character , mother ; you do her injustice ! "
36950	36968	36848	36848	she	96	" My dear boy , you do n't mean to uphold her as a paragon of virtue ! "
36969	36981	36848	36848	she	96	" No , mother , but I led her wrong ; I-- "
36982	37003	37005	37006	Mrs Bellingham	96	" We will let all discussions into the cause or duration of her present character drop , if you please , "
37062	37107	37042	37042	He	990	" As I have implied , I do not wish to ascertain your share of blame ; from what I saw of her one morning , I am convinced of her forward , intrusive manners , utterly without shame , or even common modesty . "
37108	37115	37117	37118	Mr Bellingham	94	" What are you referring to ? "
37122	37198	37117	37118	Mr Bellingham	94	" Why , when you were at the worst , and I had been watching you all night , and had just gone out in the morning for a breath of fresh air , this girl pushed herself before me , and insisted upon speaking to me . I really had to send Mrs Morgan to her before I could return to your room . A more impudent , hardened manner , I never saw . "
37199	37220	37221	37221	He	94	" Ruth was neither impudent nor hardened ; she was ignorant enough , and might offend from knowing no better . "
37412	37485	37486	37486	She	655	" We may as well drop all dispute as to the young woman 's manners ; but I suppose you do not mean to defend your connexion with her ; I suppose you are not so lost to all sense of propriety as to imagine it fit or desirable that your mother and this degraded girl should remain under the same roof , liable to meet at any hour of the day ? "
37497	37514	37486	37486	She	655	" I ask you a simple question ; is it , or is it not desirable ? "
37515	37522	37523	37523	he	94	" I suppose it is not , "
37528	37562	37523	37523	he	94	" And _ I _ suppose , from your manner , that you think the difficulty would be best solved by my taking my departure , and leaving you with your vicious companion ? "
37587	37735	37584	37584	he	94	" Mother , you are not helping me in my difficulty . I have no desire to banish you , nor to hurt you , after all your care for me . Ruth has not been so much to blame as you imagine , that I must say ; but I do not wish to see her again , if you can tell me how to arrange it otherwise , without behaving unhandsomely . Only spare me all this worry while I am so weak . I put myself in your hands . Dismiss her , as you wish it ; but let it be done handsomely , and let me hear no more about it ; I can not bear it ; let me have a quiet life , without being lectured while I am pent up here , and unable to shake off unpleasant thoughts .

37779	37887	37888	37888	She	1309	" Do n't be too severe in your self - reproaches while you are so feeble , dear Henry ; it is right to repent , but I have no doubt in my own mind she led you wrong with her artifices . But , as you say , everything should be done handsomely . I confess I was deeply grieved when I first heard of the affair , but since I have seen the girl-- Well ! I 'll say no more about her , since I see it displeases you ; but I am thankful to God that you see the error of your ways . "

I had but little time yesterday , but I guessed there was something wrong , and Gwen has just been telling me her bed has not been slept in . They were in a pretty hurry to be gone yesterday , for all that the gentleman was not fit to travel , to my way of thinking ; indeed , William Wynn , the post - boy , said he was weary enough before he got to the end of that Yspytty road ; and he thought they would have to rest there a day or two before they could go further than Pen trê Voelas . Indeed , and anyhow , the servant is to follow them with the baggage this very morning ; and now I remember , William Wynn said they would wait for her . You 'd better write a note , Mr Benson , and tell them her state . "

44365	44417	44419	44419	she	4520	" Well , well ! do n't be alarmed ; I can not spare you ; by the way , just attend to the strings on my dress ; the chambermaid here pulled them into knots , and broke them terribly , last night . It is awkward though , very , "
44432	44473	44474	44475	Mrs Bellingham	96	" If you 'll allow me , ma'am , I think I might say something that would alter the case . I believe , ma'am , you put a bank - note into the letter to the young woman yesterday ? "
44485	44567	44480	44481	the maid	4520	" Because , ma'am , when the little deformed man wrote that note ( he 's Mr Benson , ma'am ) , I have reason to believe neither he nor Mrs Morgan knew of any provision being made for the young woman . Me and the chambermaid found your letter and the bank - note lying quite promiscuous , like waste paper , on the floor of her room ; for I believe she rushed out like mad after you left . "
44568	44619	44323	44324	the maid	4520	" That , as you say , alters the case . This letter , then , is principally a sort of delicate hint that some provision ought to have been made , which is true enough , only it has been attended to already ; what became of the money ? "
44620	44657	44480	44481	the maid	4520	" Law , ma'am ! do you ask ? Of course , as soon as I saw it , I picked it up and took it to Mrs Morgan , in trust for the young person . "
44658	44684	44480	44481	the maid	4520	" Oh , that 's right . What friends has she ? Did you ever hear from Mason?--perhaps they ought to know where she is . "
44685	44855	44480	44481	the maid	4520	" Mrs Mason did tell me , ma'am , she was an orphan ; with a guardian who was no - ways akin , and who washed his hands of her when she ran off ; but Mrs Mason was sadly put out , and went into hysterics , for fear you would think she had not seen after her enough , and that she might lose your custom ; she said it was no fault of hers , for the girl was always a forward creature , boasting of her beauty , and saying how pretty she was , and striving to get where her good looks could be seen and admired,--one night in particular , ma'am , at a county ball ; and how Mrs Mason had found out she used to meet Mr Bellingham at an old woman 's house , who was a regular old witch , ma'am , and lives in the lowest part of the town , where all the bad characters haunt .

44856	44863	44865	44866	Mrs Bellingham	96	" There ! that 's enough , "
44934	45020	44899	44899	she	96	" If she has no friends , and is the creature you describe ( which is confirmed by my own observation ) , the best place for her is , as I said before , the Penitentiary . Her fifty pounds will keep her for a week or so , if she is really unable to travel , and pay for her journey ; and if on her return to Fordham she will let me know , I will undertake to obtain her admission immediately . "
45021	45050	45051	45052	Mrs Bellingham	96	" I 'm sure it 's well for her she has to do with a lady who will take any interest in her , after what has happened . "

46632	46680	46621	46621	He	143	" Well , tell it me at once , Thurstan . I am afraid you have let some one , or perhaps only your own imagination , impose upon you ; but do n't try my patience too much ; you know I 've no great stock . "
46681	46720	46721	46722	Miss Benson	143	" Then I 'll tell you . The young girl was brought to the inn here by a gentleman , who has left her ; she is very ill , and has no one to see after her . "

47668	47709	47662	47662	she	4508	" He insists upon quiet ; he orders medicines and strong broth . I can not tell you all ; Mrs Hughes can . She has been so truly good . ' Doing good , hoping for nothing again . ' "

I shall sit up to - night and watch her myself ; and I shall send you and Mrs Hughes early to bed , for you have both a worn look about you I do n't like . Are you sure the effect of that fall has gone off ? Do you feel anything of it in your back still ? After all , I owe her something for turning back to your help . Are you sure she was going to drown herself ? "
47804	47852	47662	47662	she	4508	" I can not be sure , for I have not questioned her . She has not been in a state to be questioned ; but I have no doubt whatever about it . But you must not think of sitting up after your journey , Faith . "
47853	47869	47662	47662	she	4508	" Answer me , Thurstan . Do you feel any bad effect from that fall ? "

Do tell me what that ' hardly any ' means . Besides , to set you quite at ease , you know I have never seen mountains before , and they fill me and oppress me so much that I could not sleep ; I must keep awake this first night , and see that they do n't fall on the earth and overwhelm it . And now answer my questions about yourself . "

48939	48974	48935	48935	he	143	" I beg your pardon ; but something so shocking has just been discovered -- I do n't know how to word it -- She will have a child . The doctor says so . "
49000	49022	48995	48995	she	81	" Is n't it shocking , Thurstan ? You might have knocked me down with a straw when he told me . "
49023	49028	48935	48935	he	143	" Does she know ? "
49029	49047	48935	48935	he	143	" Yes ; and I am not sure that that is n't the worst part of all . "

49055	49254	48935	48935	he	143	" Oh ! I was just beginning to have a good opinion of her , but I 'm afraid she is very depraved . After the doctor was gone , she pulled the bed - curtain aside , and looked as if she wanted to speak to me . ( I ca n't think how she heard , for we were close to the window , and spoke very low . ) Well , I went to her , though I really had taken quite a turn against her . And she whispered , quite eagerly , ' Did he say I should have a baby ? ' Of course , I could not keep it from her ; but I thought it my duty to look as cold and severe as I could . She did not seem to understand how it ought to be viewed , but took it just as if she had a right to have a baby . She said , ' Oh , my God , I thank Thee ! Oh ! I will be so good ! ' I had no patience with her then , so I left the room . "

49331	49361	48995	48995	she	81	" Wait awhile ! I want to make my feelings very clear to you , but I do n't know where to begin , or how to express myself . "
49362	49400	49409	49409	he	982	" It is , indeed , an extraordinary subject for us to have to talk about ; but if once I get clear of this girl , I 'll wash my hands of all such cases again . "

49460	49483	49409	49409	he	982	" I do not think it is a delusion . The sin appears to me to be quite distinct from its consequences . "

49563	49702	49703	49703	He	1596	" Faith , Faith ! let me beg of you not to speak so of the little innocent babe , who may be God 's messenger to lead her back to Him . Think again of her first words -- the burst of nature from her heart ! Did she not turn to God , and enter into a covenant with Him--'I will be so good ? ' Why , it draws her out of herself ! If her life has hitherto been self - seeking , and wickedly thoughtless , here is the very instrument to make her forget herself , and be thoughtful for another . Teach her ( and God will teach her , if man does not come between ) to reverence her child ; and this reverence will shut out sin,--will be purification . "
49739	49748	49750	49751	Miss Benson	143	" These are quite new ideas to me , "
49755	49791	49750	49751	Miss Benson	143	" I think you , Thurstan , are the first person I ever heard rejoicing over the birth of an illegitimate child . It appears to me , I must own , rather questionable morality . "
49792	49923	49924	49924	He	1597	" I do not rejoice . I have been all this afternoon mourning over the sin which has blighted this young creature ; I have been dreading lest , as she recovered consciousness , there should be a return of her despair . I have been thinking of every holy word , every promise to the penitent -- of the tenderness which led the Magdalen aright . I have been feeling , severely and reproachfully , the timidity which has hitherto made me blink all encounter with evils of this particular kind . Oh , Faith ! once for all , do not accuse me of questionable morality , when I am trying more than ever I did in my life to act as my blessed Lord would have done . "
49943	49976	49936	49936	she	4508	" But , Thurstan , everything might have been done to ' lead her right ' ( as you call it ) , without this child , this miserable offspring of sin . "
49977	50082	49936	49936	she	4508	" The world has , indeed , made such children miserable , innocent as they are ; but I doubt if this be according to the will of God , unless it be His punishment for the parents ' guilt ; and even then the world 's way of treatment is too apt to harden the mother 's natural love into something like hatred . Shame , and the terror of friends ' displeasure , turn her mad -- defile her holiest instincts ; and , as for the fathers -- God forgive them ! I cannot -- at least , not just now . "
50097	50119	50094	50094	she	1599	" Thurstan ( remember I 'm not convinced ) , how would you have this girl treated according to your theory ? "
50120	50163	50164	50164	He	982	" It will require some time , and much Christian love , to find out the best way . I know I 'm not very wise ; but the way I think it would be right to act in , would be this-- "
50177	50275	50170	50170	he	982	" She has incurred a responsibility -- that we both acknowledge . She is about to become a mother , and have the direction and guidance of a little tender life . I fancy such a responsibility must be serious and solemn enough , without making it into a heavy and oppressive burden , so that human nature recoils from bearing it . While we do all we can to strengthen her sense of responsibility , I would likewise do all we can to make her feel that it is responsibility for what may become a blessing . "
50276	50285	50287	50288	Miss Benson	143	" Whether the children are legitimate or illegitimate ? "
50292	50295	50297	50298	her brother	982	" Yes ! "
50302	50319	50321	50321	he	982	" The more I think , the more I believe I am right . No one , "
50329	50370	50321	50321	he	982	" can have a greater recoil from profligacy than I have . You yourself have not greater sorrow over this young creature 's sin than I have : the difference is this , you confuse the consequences with the sin . "
50371	50378	50170	50170	he	982	" I do n't understand metaphysics . "
50379	50482	50488	50488	his	1603	" I am not aware that I am talking metaphysics . I can imagine that if the present occasion be taken rightly , and used well , all that is good in her may be raised to a height unmeasured but by God ; while all that is evil and dark may , by His blessing , fade and disappear in the pure light of her child 's presence . Oh , Father ! listen to my prayer , that her redemption may date from this time . Help us to speak to her in the loving spirit of thy Holy Son ! "
50548	50553	50555	50555	she	4508	" The poor child ! "
50558	50623	50555	50555	she	4508	length--"the poor , poor child ! what it will have to struggle through and endure ! Do you remember Thomas Wilkins , and the way he threw the registry of his birth and baptism back in your face ? Why , he would not have the situation ; he went to sea and was drowned , rather than present the record of his shame . "
50624	50681	50555	50555	she	4508	" I do remember it all . It has often haunted me . She must strengthen her child to look to God , rather than to man 's opinion . It will be the discipline , the penance , she has incurred . She must teach it to be ( humanly speaking ) self - dependent . "
50682	50687	50689	50690	Miss Benson	143	" But after all , "
50715	50732	50693	50693	she	1605	her)--"after all , it might be concealed . The very child need never know its illegitimacy . "
50733	50736	50738	50739	her brother	982	" How ? "
50741	50782	50785	50785	tempter	1607	" Why -- we know so little about her yet ; but in that letter , it said she had no friends;--now , could she not go into quite a fresh place , and be passed off as a widow ? "
50969	50978	51021	51021	her	618	" How could it be managed , Faith ? "
50979	51013	51021	51022	her brother	982	" Nay , I must know much more , which she alone can tell us , before I can see how it is to be managed . It is certainly the best plan . "
51014	51019	51021	51022	her brother	982	" Perhaps it is , "
51182	51192	51174	51174	she	618	" That young creature 's name is Ruth Hilton . "
51193	51203	51174	51174	she	618	" Indeed ! how did you find it out ? "
51204	51289	51174	51174	she	618	" From herself , of course . She is much stronger . I slept with her last night , and I was aware she was awake long before I liked to speak , but at last I began . I do n't know what I said , or how it went on , but I think it was a little relief to her to tell me something about herself . She sobbed and cried herself to sleep ; I think she is asleep now . "
51290	51299	51174	51174	she	618	" Tell me what she said about herself . "
51300	51445	51174	51174	she	618	" Oh , it was really very little ; it was evidently a most painful subject . She is an orphan , without brother or sister , and with a guardian , whom , I think she said , she never saw but once . He apprenticed her ( after her father 's death ) to a dressmaker . This Mr Bellingham got acquainted with her , and they used to meet on Sunday afternoons . One day they were late , lingering on the road , when the dressmaker came up by accident . She seems to have been very angry , and not unnaturally so . The girl took fright at her threats , and the lover persuaded her to go off with him to London , there and then . Last May , I think it was . That 's all . "
51446	51456	51174	51174	she	618	" Did she express any sorrow for her error ? "
51457	51569	51174	51174	she	618	" No , not in words , but her voice was broken with sobs , though she tried to make it steady . After a while she began to talk about her baby , but shyly , and with much hesitation . She asked me how much I thought she could earn as a dressmaker , by working very , very hard ; and that brought us round to her child . I thought of what you had said , Thurstan , and I tried to speak to her as you wished me . I am not sure if it was right ; I am doubtful in my own mind still . "
51570	51588	51174	51174	she	618	" Do n't be doubtful , Faith ! Dear Faith , I thank you for your kindness . "
51589	51627	51174	51174	she	618	" There is really nothing to thank me for . It is almost impossible to help being kind to her ; there is something so meek and gentle about her , so patient , and so grateful ! "
51628	51636	51174	51174	she	618	" What does she think of doing ? "
51637	51737	51174	51174	she	618	" Poor child ! she thinks of taking lodgings -- very cheap ones , she says ; there she means to work night and day to earn enough for her child . For , she said to me , with such pretty earnestness , ' It must never know want , whatever I do . I have deserved suffering , but it will be such a little innocent darling ! ' Her utmost earnings would not be more than seven or eight shillings a week , I 'm afraid ; and then she is so young and so pretty ! "
51738	51761	51174	51174	she	618	" There is that fifty pounds Mrs Morgan brought me , and those two letters . Does she know about them yet ? "
51762	51822	51174	51174	she	618	" No ; I did not like to tell her till she is a little stronger . Oh , Thurstan ! I wish there was not this prospect of a child . I can not help it . I do -- I could see a way in which we might help her , if it were not for that . "
51823	51829	51174	51174	she	618	" How do you mean ? "
51830	51923	51174	51174	she	618	" Oh , it 's no use thinking of it , as it is ! Or else we might have taken her home with us , and kept her till she had got a little dress - making in the congregation , but for this meddlesome child ; that spoils everything . You must let me grumble to you , Thurstan . I was very good to her , and spoke as tenderly and respectfully of the little thing as if it were the Queen 's , and born in lawful matrimony . "
51924	51969	51174	51174	she	618	" That 's right , my dear Faith ! Grumble away to me , if you like . I 'll forgive you , for the kind thought of taking her home with us . But do you think her situation is an insuperable objection ? "
51970	51987	51174	51174	she	618	" Why , Thurstan!--it 's so insuperable , it puts it quite out of the question . "
51988	52004	51174	51174	she	618	" How?--that 's only repeating your objection . Why is it out of the question ? "
52005	52050	51174	51174	she	618	" If there had been no child coming , we might have called her by her right name -- Miss Hilton ; that 's one thing . Then , another is , the baby in our house . Why , Sally would go distraught ! "
52051	52069	52071	52071	he	1623	" Never mind Sally . If she were an orphan relation of our own , left widowed , "
52080	52137	52071	52071	he	1623	" You yourself suggested she should be considered as a widow , for the child 's sake . I 'm only taking up your ideas , dear Faith . I respect you for thinking of taking her home ; it is just what we ought to do . Thank you for reminding me of my duty . "
52138	52165	51174	51174	she	618	" Nay , it was only a passing thought . Think of Mr Bradshaw . Oh ! I tremble at the thought of his grim displeasure . "
52166	52238	52071	52071	he	1623	" We must think of a higher than Mr Bradshaw . I own I should be a very coward , if he knew . He is so severe , so inflexible . But after all he sees so little of us ; he never comes to tea , you know , but is always engaged when Mrs Bradshaw comes . I do n't think he knows of what our household consists . "
52239	52306	51174	51174	she	618	" Not know Sally ? Oh yes , but he does . He asked Mrs Bradshaw one day , if she knew what wages we gave her , and said we might get a far more efficient and younger servant for the money . And , speaking about money , think what our expenses would be if we took her home for the next six months . "
52354	52361	52363	52363	he	982	" There 's the fifty pounds , "
52374	52383	52393	52393	her	4508	" Yes , there 's the fifty pounds , "
52396	52403	52393	52393	her	4508	" I suppose it is hers . "
52404	52443	52393	52393	her	4508	" I suppose it is ; and being so , we must not think who gave it to her . It will defray her expenses . I am very sorry , but I think we must take it . "
52444	52458	52460	52461	Miss Benson	143	" It would never do to apply to him under the present circumstances , "
52468	52476	52478	52479	her brother	982	" No , that we wo n't , "
52483	52532	52478	52479	her brother	982	" If she consents to let us take care of her , we will never let her stoop to request anything from him , even for his child . She can live on bread and water . We can all live on bread and water rather than that . "
52533	52597	52478	52478	her	1625	" Then I will speak to her and propose the plan . Oh , Thurstan ! from a child you could persuade me to anything ! I hope I am doing right . However much I oppose you at first , I am sure to yield soon ; almost in proportion to my violence at first . I think I am very weak . "
52598	52649	52478	52479	her brother	982	" No , not in this instance . We are both right : I , in the way in which the child ought to be viewed ; you , dear good Faith , for thinking of taking her home with us . God bless you , dear , for it ! "
52704	52714	52716	52716	she	81	" Do you recollect receiving this letter , Ruth ? "
52821	52837	52818	52818	she	81	" If you please , Miss Benson , I should like to return this money . "
52838	52844	52860	52860	she	81	" Why , my dear ? "
52845	52858	52860	52860	she	81	" I have a strong feeling against taking it . While he , "
52878	52972	52860	52860	she	81	" loved me , he gave me many things -- my watch -- oh , many things ; and I took them from him gladly and thankfully because he loved me -- for I would have given him anything -- and I thought of them as signs of love . But this money pains my heart . He has left off loving me , and has gone away . This money seems -- oh , Miss Benson -- it seems as if he could comfort me , for being forsaken , by money . "
53013	53029	53007	53007	she	81	" So , will you take the trouble of sending it back to Mrs Bellingham ? "
53030	53069	53070	53071	Miss Benson	143	" That I will , my dear . I am glad of it , that I am ! They do n't deserve to have the power of giving : they do n't deserve that you should take it . "
53090	53095	53070	53071	Miss Benson	143	" From Ruth Hilton . "
53096	53107	53109	53109	she	81	" And now we wash our hands of these Bellinghams , "
53285	53326	53272	53273	her brother	982	" I admired her at the time for sending away her fifty pounds so proudly ; but I think she has a cold heart : she hardly thanked me at all for my proposal of taking her home with us . "
53327	53367	53250	53250	wean	1637	" Her thoughts are full of other things just now ; and people have such different ways of showing feeling : some by silence , some by words . At any rate , it is unwise to expect gratitude . "
53368	53379	53272	53273	her brother	982	" What do you expect -- not indifference or ingratitude ? "
53380	53501	53272	53273	her brother	982	" It is better not to expect or calculate consequences . The longer I live , the more fully I see that . Let us try simply to do right actions , without thinking of the feelings they are to call out in others . We know that no holy or self - denying effort can fall to the ground vain and useless ; but the sweep of eternity is large , and God alone knows when the effect is to be produced . We are trying to do right now , and to feel right ; do n't let us perplex ourselves with endeavouring to map out how she should feel , or how she should show her feelings . "
53502	53516	53518	53519	Miss Benson	143	" That 's all very fine , and I dare say very true , "
53525	53642	53518	53519	Miss Benson	143	" But ' a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush ; ' and I would rather have had one good , hearty ' Thank you , ' now , for all I have been planning to do for her , than the grand effects you promise me in the ' sweep of eternity . ' Do n't be grave and sorrowful , Thurstan , or I 'll go out of the room . I can stand Sally 's scoldings , but I ca n't bear your look of quiet depression whenever I am a little hasty or impatient . I had rather you would give me a good box on the ear . "
53643	53695	53272	53273	her brother	982	" And I would often rather you would speak , if ever so hastily , instead of whistling . So , if I box your ears when I am vexed with you , will you promise to scold me when you are put out of the way , instead of whistling ? "
53696	53769	53518	53519	Miss Benson	143	" Very well ! that 's a bargain . You box , and I scold . But , seriously , I began to calculate our money when she so cavalierly sent off the fifty - pound note ( I ca n't help admiring her for it ) , and I am very much afraid we shall not have enough to pay the doctor 's bill , and take her home with us . "
53770	53781	53783	53784	Mr Benson	143	" She must go inside the coach whatever we do , "
53788	53804	53783	53784	Mr Benson	143	" Who 's there ? Come in ! Oh ! Mrs Hughes ! Sit down . "
53805	53873	53518	53519	Miss Benson	143	" Indeed , sir , and I can not stay ; but the young lady has just made me find up her watch for her , and asked me to get it sold to pay the doctor , and the little things she has had since she came ; and please , sir , indeed , I do n't know where to sell it nearer than Carnarvon . "
53874	53881	53883	53884	Miss Benson	143	" That is good of her , "
53922	53934	53936	53937	her brother	982	" And her goodness just helps us out of our dilemma , "
53988	54053	53984	53984	her	142	" Mr Jones , the doctor , is going to be married , perhaps he would like nothing better than to give this pretty watch to his bride ; indeed , and I think it 's very likely ; and he 'll pay money for it as well as letting alone his bill . I 'll ask him , sir , at any rate . "
54083	54089	54074	54074	He	131	" paid money for it ; "
54137	54149	54151	54152	Miss Benson	143	" Would you object to my buying you a black gown ? "
54174	54211	54164	54164	She	142	" My brother and I think it would be better to call you -- as if in fact you were -- a widow . It will save much awkwardness , and it will spare your child much-- "
54256	54273	54275	54275	she	142	" Oh , yes ! certainly . Thank you much for thinking of it . Indeed , "
54285	54316	54275	54275	she	142	" I do n't know how to thank you for all you are doing ; but I do love you , and will pray for you , if I may . "

54335	54351	54275	54275	she	142	" Yes , if I may . If you will let me pray for you . "
54352	54419	54420	54421	Miss Benson	143	" Certainly , my dear . My dear Ruth , you do n't know how often I sin ; I do so wrong , with my few temptations . We are both of us great sinners in the eyes of the Most Holy ; let us pray for each other . Do n't speak so again , my dear ; at least , not to me ! "
54467	54483	54462	54462	she	1644	" Then I may get you a black gown?--and we may call you Mrs Hilton ? "
54484	54491	54493	54493	Ruth	81	" No ; not Mrs Hilton ! "

I sometimes think I 'll try and fret a bit , just to make myself a better figure ; but , Lord ! it 's no use , it 's against my nature ; so I laugh and grow fat again . I 'd be quite thankful for a fit of anxiety as would make me feel easy in my clothes , which them manty - makers will make so tight I 'm fairly throttled . "

I can face it if I 'm told out and out , but I can not abide the way some folk has of denying there 's trouble or pain to be met ; just as if their saying there was none , would do away with it .

Widows wears these sort o ' caps , and has their hair cut off ; and whether widows wears wedding - rings or not , they shall have their hair cut off -- they shall . I 'll have no half work in this house . I 've lived with the family forty - nine year come Michaelmas , and I 'll not see it disgraced by any one 's fine long curls . Sit down and let me snip off your hair , and let me see you sham decently in a widow 's cap to - morrow , or I 'll leave the house .

You see , Master Thurstan is no wiser than a babby in some things ; and Miss Faith just lets him have his own way ; so it 's all left to me to keep him out of scrapes . I 'll wish you a very good night . I 've heard many a one say as long hair was not wholesome . Good night . "

61440	61536	61438	61438	he	143	" Oh ! many little things . It was her odd way of ducking her head about , as if to catch a good view of Ruth 's left hand , that made me think of the wedding - ring ; and once , yesterday , when I thought I had made up quite a natural speech , and was saying how sad it was for so young a creature to be left a widow , she broke in with ' widow be farred ! ' in a very strange , contemptuous kind of manner . "
61537	61572	61388	61388	She	81	" If she suspects , we had far better tell her the truth at once . She will never rest till she finds it out , so we must make a virtue of necessity . "

She took it very well , though . She was as quiet as a lamb , and I clipped her pretty roughly at first . I must say , though , if I 'd ha ' known who your visitor was , I 'd ha ' packed up my things and cleared myself out of the house before such as her came into it . As it 's done , I suppose I must stand by you , and help you through with it ; I only hope I sha n't lose my character,--and me a parish clerk 's daughter . "

Why , there was that Nelly Brandon 's child as was left at our door , if I had n't gone to th ' overseer we should have had that Irish tramp 's babby saddled on us for life ; but I went off and told th ' overseer , and th ' mother was caught .

A bungling lie would be worse than useless . And , Thurstan -- it may be very wrong -- but I believe -- I am afraid I enjoy not being fettered by truth . Do n't look so grave . You know it is necessary , if ever it was , to tell falsehoods now ; and do n't be angry with me because I do it well . "

65661	65677	65678	65679	Mr Benson	143	" Because I feel as if Mr Bradshaw had no right to offer it me . "

65699	65712	65691	65692	Miss Benson	143	" You think that it is a right which must be earned ? "

65732	65855	65611	65611	Ruth	81	" I understand what you mean . It is a delight to have gifts made to you by those whom you esteem and love , because then such gifts are merely to be considered as fringes to the garment -- as inconsiderable additions to the mighty treasure of their affection , adding a grace , but no additional value , to what before was precious , and proceeding as naturally out of that as leaves burgeon out upon the trees ; but you feel it to be different when there is no regard for the giver to idealise the gift -- when it simply takes its stand among your property as so much money 's value . Is this it , Ruth ? "
65856	65892	65691	65692	Miss Benson	143	" I think it is . I never reasoned why I felt as I did ; I only knew that Mr Bradshaw 's giving me a present hurt me , instead of making me glad . "
65893	66005	65718	65718	she	81	" Well , but there is another side of the case we have not looked at yet -- we must think of that , too . You know who said , ' Do unto others as ye would that they should do unto you ' ? Mr Bradshaw may not have had that in his mind when he desired his wife to send you this ; he may have been self - seeking , and only anxious to gratify his love of patronising -- that is the worst motive we can give him ; and that would be no excuse for your thinking only of yourself , and returning his present . "
66006	66018	66020	66020	Ruth	81	" But you would not have me pretend to be obliged ? "
66022	66267	66020	66020	Ruth	81	" No , I would not . I have often been similarly situated to you , Ruth ; Mr Bradshaw has frequently opposed me on the points on which I feel the warmest -- am the most earnestly convinced . He , no doubt , thinks me Quixotic , and often speaks of me , and to me , with great contempt when he is angry . I suppose he has a little fit of penitence afterwards , or perhaps he thinks he can pay for ungracious speeches by a present ; so , formerly , he invariably sent me something after these occasions . It was a time , of all others , to feel as you are doing now ; but I became convinced it would be right to accept them , giving only the very cool thanks which I felt . This omission of all show of much gratitude had the best effect -- the presents have much diminished ; but if the gifts have lessened , the unjustifiable speeches have decreased in still greater proportion , and I am sure we respect each other more . Take this muslin , Ruth , for the reason I named ; and thank him as your feelings prompt you . Overstrained expressions of gratitude always seem like an endeavour to place the receiver of these expressions in the position of debtor for future favours . But you wo n't fall into this error . "

69073	69291	69071	69071	Ruth	81	" Oh , he was a grand gentleman from Lunnon , as had seen Miss Faith , and been struck by her pretty looks when she was out on a visit , and came here to ask her to marry him . She said , ' No , she would never leave Master Thurstan , as could never marry ; ' but she pined a deal at after he went away . She kept up afore Master Thurstan , but I seed her fretting , though I never let on that I did , for I thought she 'd soonest get over it and be thankful at after she 'd the strength to do right . However , I 've no business to be talking of Miss Benson 's concerns . I 'll tell you of my own sweethearts and welcome , or I 'll tell you of the dinner , which was the grandest thing I ever did in my life , but I thought a Lunnoner should never think country folks knew nothing ; and , my word ! I puzzled him with his dinner . I 'm doubting whether to this day he knows whether what he was eating was fish , flesh , or fowl . Shall I tell you how I managed ? "
69322	71889	71890	71890	Sally	148	" Well , you see , I do n't know as I should call them sweethearts ; for excepting John Rawson , who was shut up in the mad - house the next week , I never had what you may call a downright offer of marriage but once . But I had once ; and so I may say I had a sweetheart . I was beginning to be afeard though , for one likes to be axed ; that 's but civility ; and I remember , after I had turned forty , and afore Jeremiah Dixon had spoken , I began to think John Rawson had perhaps not been so very mad , and that I 'd done ill to lightly his offer , as a madman 's , if it was to be the only one I was ever to have ; I do n't mean as I 'd have had him , but I thought , if it was to come o'er again , I 'd speak respectful of him to folk , and say it were only his way to go about on all fours , but that he was a sensible man in most things . However , I 'd had my laugh , and so had others , at my crazy lover , and it was late now to set him up as a Solomon . However , I thought it would be no bad thing to be tried again ; but I little thought the trial would come when it did . You see , Saturday night is a leisure night in counting - houses and such - like places , while it 's the busiest of all for servants . Well ! it was a Saturday night , and I 'd my baize apron on , and the tails of my bed - gown pinned together behind , down on my knees , pipeclaying the kitchen , when a knock comes to the back door . ' Come in ! ' says I ; but it knocked again , as if it were too stately to open the door for itself ; so I got up , rather cross , and opened the door ; and there stood Jerry Dixon , Mr Holt 's head clerk ; only he was not head clerk then . So I stood , stopping up the door , fancying he wanted to speak to master ; but he kind of pushed past me , and telling me summut about the weather ( as if I could not see it for myself ) , he took a chair , and sat down by the oven . ' Cool and easy ! ' thought I ; meaning hisself , not his place , which I knew must be pretty hot . Well ! it seemed no use standing waiting for my gentleman to go ; not that he had much to say either ; but he kept twirling his hat round and round , and smoothing the nap on't with the back of his hand . So at last I squatted down to my work , and thinks I , I shall be on my knees all ready if he puts up a prayer , for I knew he was a Methodee by bringing - up , and had only lately turned to master 's way of thinking ; and them Methodees are terrible hands at unexpected prayers when one least looks for 'em . I ca n't say I like their way of taking one by surprise , as it were ; but then I 'm a parish clerk 's daughter , and could never demean myself to dissenting fashions , always save and except Master Thurstan 's , bless him . However , I 'd been caught once or twice unawares , so this time I thought I 'd be up to it , and I moved a dry duster wherever I went , to kneel upon in case he began when I were in a wet place . By - and - by I thought , if the man would pray it would be a blessing , for it would prevent his sending his eyes after me wherever I went ; for when they takes to praying they shuts their eyes , and quivers th ' lids in a queer kind o ' way -- them Dissenters does . I can speak pretty plain to you , for you 're bred in the Church like mysel ' , and must find it as out o ' the way as I do to be among dissenting folk . God forbid I should speak disrespectful of Master Thurstan and Miss Faith , though ; I never think on them as Church or Dissenters , but just as Christians . But to come back to Jerry . First , I tried always to be cleaning at his back ; but when he wheeled round , so as always to face me , I thought I 'd try a different game . So , says I , ' Master Dixon , I ax your pardon , but I must pipeclay under your chair . Will you please to move ? ' Well , he moved ; and by - and - by I was at him again with the same words ; and at after that , again and again , till he were always moving about wi ' his chair behind him , like a snail as carries its house on its back . And the great gaupus never seed that I were pipeclaying the same places twice over . At last I got desperate cross , he were so in my way ; so I made two big crosses on the tails of his brown coat ; for you see , whenever he went , up or down , he drew out the tails of his coat from under him , and stuck them through the bars of the chair ; and flesh and blood could not resist pipeclaying them for him ; and a pretty brushing he 'd have , I reckon , to get it off again . Well ! at length he clears his throat uncommon loud ; so I spreads my duster , and shuts my eyes all ready ; but when nought comed of it , I opened my eyes a little bit to see what he were about . My word ! if there he was n't down on his knees right facing me , staring as hard as he could . Well ! I thought it would be hard work to stand that , if he made a long ado ; so I shut my eyes again , and tried to think serious , as became what I fancied were coming ; but , forgive me ! but I thought why could n't the fellow go in and pray wi ' Master Thurstan , as had always a calm spirit ready for prayer , instead o ' me , who had my dresser to scour , let alone an apron to iron . At last he says , says he , ' Sally ! will you oblige me with your hand ? ' So I thought it were , maybe , Methodee fashion to pray hand in hand ; and I 'll not deny but I wished I 'd washed it better after black - leading the kitchen fire . I thought I 'd better tell him it were not so clean as I could wish , so says I , ' Master Dixon , you shall have it , and welcome , if I may just go and wash 'em first . ' But , says he , ' My dear Sally , dirty or clean it 's all the same to me , seeing I 'm only speaking in a figuring way . What I 'm asking on my bended knees is , that you 'd please to be so kind as to be my wedded wife ; week after next will suit me , if it 's agreeable to you ! ' My word ! I were up on my feet in an instant ! It were odd now , were n't it ? I never thought of taking the fellow , and getting married ; for all , I 'll not deny , I had been thinking it would be agreeable to be axed . But all at once , I could n't abide the chap . ' Sir , ' says I , trying to look shame - faced as became the occasion , but for all that , feeling a twittering round my mouth that I were afeard might end in a laugh--'Master Dixon , I 'm obleeged to you for the compliment , and thank ye all the same , but I think I 'd prefer a single life . ' He looked mighty taken aback ; but in a minute he cleared up , and was as sweet as ever . He still kept on his knees , and I wished he 'd take himself up ; but , I reckon , he thought it would give force to his words ; says he , ' Think again , my dear Sally . I 've a four - roomed house , and furniture conformable ; and eighty pound a year . You may never have such a chance again . ' There were truth enough in that , but it was not pretty in the man to say it ; and it put me up a bit . ' As for that , neither you nor I can tell , Master Dixon . You 're not the first chap as I 've had down on his knees afore me , axing me to marry him ( you see I were thinking of John Rawson , only I thought there were no need to say he were on all fours -- it were truth he were on his knees , you know ) , and maybe you 'll not be the last . Anyhow , I 've no wish to change my condition just now . ' ' I 'll wait till Christmas , ' says he . ' I 've a pig as will be ready for killing then , so I must get married before that . ' Well now ! would you believe it ? the pig were a temptation . I 'd a receipt for curing hams , as Miss Faith would never let me try , saying the old way were good enough . However , I resisted . Says I , very stern , because I felt I 'd been wavering , ' Master Dixon , once for all , pig or no pig , I 'll not marry you . And if you 'll take my advice , you 'll get up off your knees . The flags is but damp yet , and it would be an awkward thing to have rheumatiz just before winter . ' With that he got up , stiff enough . He looked as sulky a chap as ever I clapped eyes on . And as he were so black and cross , I thought I 'd done well ( whatever came of the pig ) to say ' No ' to him . ' You may live to repent this , ' says he , very red . ' But I 'll not be too hard upon ye , I 'll give you another chance . I 'll let you have the night to think about it , and I 'll just call in to hear your second thoughts , after chapel to - morrow . ' Well now ! did ever you hear the like ? But that is the way with all of them men , thinking so much of theirselves , and that it 's but ask and have . They 've never had me , though ; and I shall be sixty - one next Martinmas , so there 's not much time left for them to try me , I reckon . Well ! when Jeremiah said that , he put me up more than ever , and I says , ' My first thoughts , second thoughts , and third thoughts is all one and the same ; you 've but tempted me once , and that was when you spoke of your pig . But of yoursel ' you 're nothing to boast on , and so I 'll bid you good night , and I 'll keep my manners , or else , if I told the truth , I should say it had been a great loss of time listening to you . But I 'll be civil -- so good night . ' He never said a word , but went off as black as thunder , slamming the door after him . The master called me in to prayers , but I ca n't say I could put my mind to them , for my heart was beating so . However , it was a comfort to have had an offer of holy matrimony ; and though it flustered me , it made me think more of myself . In the night , I began to wonder if I 'd not been cruel and hard to him . You see , I were feverish - like ; and the old song of Barbary Allen would keep running in my head , and I thought I were Barbary , and he were young Jemmy Gray , and that maybe he 'd die for love of me ; and I pictured him to mysel ' , lying on his death - bed , with his face turned to the wall , ' wi ' deadly sorrow sighing , ' and I could ha ' pinched mysel ' for having been so like cruel Barbary Allen . And when I got up next day , I found it hard to think on the real Jerry Dixon I had seen the night before , apart from the sad and sorrowful Jerry I thought on a - dying , when I were between sleeping and waking . And for many a day I turned sick , when I heard the passing bell , for I thought it were the bell loud - knelling which were to break my heart wi ' a sense of what I 'd missed in saying ' No ' to Jerry , and so killing him with cruelty . But in less than a three week , I heard parish bells a - ringing merrily for a wedding ; and in the course of a morning , some one says to me , ' Hark ! how the bells is ringing for Jerry Dixon 's wedding ! ' And , all on a sudden , he changed back again from a heart - broken young fellow , like Jemmy Gray , into a stout , middle - aged man , ruddy - complexioned , with a wart on his left cheek like life !

Why ! dear ah me , making a bed may be done after a Christian fashion , I take it , or else what 's to come of such as me in heaven , who 've had little enough time on earth for clapping ourselves down on our knees for set prayers ? When I was a girl , and wretched enough about Master Thurstan , and the crook on his back which came of the fall I gave him , I took to praying and sighing , and giving up the world ; and I thought it were wicked to care for the flesh , so I made heavy puddings , and was careless about dinner and the rooms , and thought I was doing my duty , though I did call myself a miserable sinner . But one night , the old missus ( Master Thurstan 's mother ) came in , and sat down by me , as I was a - scolding myself , without thinking of what I was saying ; and , says she , ' Sally ! what are you blaming yourself about , and groaning over ? We hear you in the parlour every night , and it makes my heart ache . ' ' Oh , ma'am , ' says I , ' I 'm a miserable sinner , and I 'm travailing in the new birth . ' ' Was that the reason , ' says she , ' why the pudding was so heavy to - day ? ' ' Oh , ma'am , ma'am , ' said I , ' if you would not think of the things of the flesh , but trouble yourself about your immortal soul . ' And I sat a - shaking my head to think about her soul . ' But , ' says she , in her sweet - dropping voice , ' I do try to think of my soul every hour of the day , if by that you mean trying to do the will of God , but we 'll talk now about the pudding ; Master Thurstan could not eat it , and I know you 'll be sorry for that . ' Well ! I was sorry , but I did n't choose to say so , as she seemed to expect me ; so says I , ' It 's a pity to see children brought up to care for things of the flesh ; ' and then I could have bitten my tongue out , for the missus looked so grave , and I thought of my darling little lad pining for want of his food . At last , says she , ' Sally , do you think God has put us into the world just to be selfish , and do nothing but see after our own souls ? or to help one another with heart and hand , as Christ did to all who wanted help ? ' I was silent , for , you see , she puzzled me . So she went on , ' What is that beautiful answer in your Church catechism , Sally ? ' I were pleased to hear a Dissenter , as I did not think would have done it , speak so knowledgeably about the catechism , and she went on : ' "
74472	74961	74962	74962	Sally	148	" well , your station is a servant , and it is as honourable as a king 's , if you look at it right ; you are to help and serve others in one way , just as a king is to help others in another . Now what way are you to help and serve , or to do your duty , in that station of life unto which it has pleased God to call you ? Did it answer God 's purpose , and serve Him , when the food was unfit for a child to eat , and unwholesome for any one ? ' Well ! I would not give it up , I was so pig - headed about my soul ; so says I , ' I wish folks would be content with locusts and wild honey , and leave other folks in peace to work out their salvation ; ' and I groaned out pretty loud to think of missus 's soul . I often think since she smiled a bit at me ; but she said , ' Well , Sally , to - morrow , you shall have time to work out your salvation ; but as we have no locusts in England , and I do n't think they 'd agree with Master Thurstan if we had , I will come and make the pudding ; but I shall try and do it well , not only for him to like it , but because everything may be done in a right way or a wrong ; the right way is to do it as well as we can , as in God 's sight ; the wrong is to do it in a self - seeking spirit , which either leads us to neglect it to follow out some device of our own for our own ends , or to give up too much time and thought to it both before and after the doing . ' Well ! I thought of all old missus 's words this morning , when I saw you making the beds . You sighed so , you could not half shake the pillows ; your heart was not in your work ; and yet it was the duty God had set you , I reckon ; I know it 's not the work parsons preach about ; though I do n't think they go so far off the mark when they read , ' whatsoever thy hand findeth to do , that do with all thy might . ' Just try for a day to think of all the odd jobs as has to be done well and truly as in God 's sight , not just slurred over anyhow , and you 'll go through them twice as cheerfully , and have no thought to spare for sighing or crying .

Have not you often wondered what was to be done with Ruth when the time came at which we promised her she should earn her living ? I am sure you have , because I have so often thought about it myself . And yet I never dared to speak out my fear , because that seemed giving it a shape . And now Mr Bradshaw has put all to rights . He invited Mr Jackson to dinner yesterday , just as we were going into chapel ; and then he turned to me and asked me if I would come to tea -- straight from afternoon chapel , because Mrs Bradshaw wanted to speak to me . He made it very clear I was not to bring Ruth ; and , indeed , she was only too happy to stay at home with baby . And so I went ; and Mrs Bradshaw took me into her bedroom , and shut the doors , and said Mr Bradshaw had told her , that he did not like Jemima being so much confined with the younger ones while they were at their lessons , and that he wanted some one above a nursemaid to sit with them while their masters were there -- some one who would see about their learning their lessons , and who would walk out with them ; a sort of nursery governess , I think she meant , though she did not say so ; and Mr Bradshaw ( for , of course , I saw his thoughts and words constantly peeping out , though he had told her to speak to me ) believed that our Ruth would be the very person . Now , Thurstan , do n't look so surprised , as if she had never come into your head ! I am sure I saw what Mrs Bradshaw was driving at , long before she came to the point ; and I could scarcely keep from smiling , and saying , ' We 'd jump at the proposal'--long before I ought to have known anything about it .

You 've lived a twelvemonth in the house with Ruth , and the end of it is , you think she will do his children harm ! Besides , who encouraged Jemima to come to the house so much to see Ruth ?

' But here I ask you , Thurstan , can you , or I , or Sally ( quick - eyed as she is ) , say , that in any one thing we have had true , just occasion to find fault with Ruth ? I do n't mean that she is perfect -- she acts without thinking , her temper is sometimes warm and hasty ; but have we any right to go and injure her prospects for life , by telling Mr Bradshaw all we know of her errors -- only sixteen when she did so wrong , and never to escape from it all her many years to come -- to have the despair which would arise from its being known , clutching her back into worse sin ?

' She said it so humbly and fearfully that all I thought of was how to cheer her , and I answered and asked her if she did not hope to be good enough to bring up her own darling to be a brave Christian man ? And she lifted up her head , and I saw her eyes looking wild and wet and earnest , and she said , ' With God 's help , that will I try to make my child . ' And I said then , ' Ruth , as you strive and as you pray for your own child , so you must strive and pray to make Mary and Elizabeth good , if you are trusted with them .

I want to know how I am to keep remembering how old I am , so as to prevent myself from feeling so young ? I was quite startled just now to see my hair in the glass , for I can generally tell if my cap is straight by feeling . I 'll tell you what I 'll do -- I'll cut off a piece of my grey hair , and plait it together for a marker in my Bible ! "
87914	87935	87909	87909	Sally	148	" You 'll be taking to painting your cheeks next , now you 've once thought of dyeing your hair . "

He treats me just like a child , and as if I should lose all my present opinions when I know more of the world . I am sure I should like never to know the world , if it was to make me think as he does , hard man that he is ! I wonder what made him take Jem Brown on as gardener again , if he does not believe that above one criminal in a thousand is restored to goodness . I 'll ask him , some day , if that was not acting on impulse rather than principle . Poor impulse ! how you do get abused . But I will tell Mr Farquhar I will not let him interfere with me .

It seems such a little while since her hair was turned up , and he has always been a grave middle - aged man ever since I can recollect ; and then , have you never noticed how often he finds fault with her -- almost lectures her ?

94011	94083	94085	94086	Mr Bradshaw	149	" No , not spoken . It has been implied between us for some time . At least , I have been so aware of his intentions that I have made several allusions , in the course of business , to it , as a thing that might take place . He can hardly have misunderstood ; he must have seen that I perceived his design , and approved of it , "
94181	94261	94165	94165	he	149	" The whole thing is so suitable -- the advantages arising from the connexion are so obvious ; besides which , I am quite aware , from many little speeches of Mr Farquhar 's , that he contemplates marriage at no very distant time ; and he seldom leaves Eccleston , and visits few families besides our own -- certainly , none that can compare with ours in the advantages you have all received in moral and religious training .

94500	94559	94495	94496	her father	411	" Your mother is in the habit of repeating accurately to me what takes place in my absence ; besides which , the whole speech is not one of hers ; she has not altered a word in the repetition , I am convinced . I have trained her to habits of accuracy very unusual in a woman . "
94637	94691	94621	94621	She	217	" I have said enough now , I hope , to make you behave in a becoming manner to Mr Farquhar ; if your temper is too unruly to be always under your own control , at least have respect to my injunctions , and take some pains to curb it before him . "

I did not think you could choose a wife in that cold - hearted way , though you did profess to act by rule and line ; but you think to have me , do you ? because it is fitting and suitable , and you want to be married , and ca n't spare time for wooing "
94981	95108	95109	95109	She	2477	" And how often I have thought you were too grand for me ! but now I know better . Now I can believe that all you do is done from calculation ; you are good because it adds to your business credit -- you talk in that high strain about principle because it sounds well , and is respectable -- and even these things are better than your cold way of looking out for a wife , just as you would do for a carpet , to add to your comforts , and settle you respectably . But I wo n't be that wife . You shall see something of me which shall make you not acquiesce so quietly in the arrangements of the firm . "

I want to have a little conversation with you ; not about your pupils , they are going on well under your care , I am sure ; and I often congratulate myself on the choice I made -- I assure you I do . But now I want to speak to you about Jemima . She is very fond of you , and perhaps you could take some opportunity of observing to her -- in short , of saying to her , that she is behaving very foolishly -- in fact , disgusting Mr Farquhar ( who was , I know , inclined to like her ) by the sullen , sulky way she behaves in , when he is by . "
95881	95900	95857	95857	Ruth	81	" I hardly understand , sir . You are displeased with Miss Bradshaw 's manners to Mr Farquhar . "

96064	96092	96048	96048	Ruth	81	" If you would allow me to finish what I have got to say , without interruption , I could then tell you what I do wish . "

96107	96173	96103	96103	Ruth	81	" I wish you to join our circle occasionally in an evening ; Mrs Bradshaw shall send you an invitation when Mr Farquhar is likely to be here . Warned by me , and , consequently , with your observation quickened , you can hardly fail to notice instances of what I have pointed out ; and then I will trust to your own good sense "

You know , it would be but right for her to do what papa told her ; and he said a great deal to her , the other day , about finding out why you were so cross , and bringing you right . And you are right now , dear ! "

101233	101263	101268	101268	she	217	" I am quite sure . He spoke to her last Friday morning in the study . I remember it was Friday , because Mrs Dean was working here . "

101689	101746	101686	101687	Mr Farquhar	193	" I would not give it him . I would let him have money to set up again as soon as he had passed the Bankruptcy Court ; if he never passed , I might , in some cases , make him an allowance ; but I would always keep my justice and my charity separate . "
101747	101771	101820	101821	Mr Farquhar	193	" And yet charity ( in your sense of the word ) degrades ; justice , tempered with mercy and consideration , elevates . "

Oh , Jemima , it was so pretty -- little flecks of light coming down here and there through the leaves , and quivering on the ground . You must go with us to - morrow . "

111629	111713	111318	111318	she	217	" Eager ! Why , I should say there never was any one cooler than Mr Donne . Think of the trouble your papa has had this month past , and then remember the slow way in which Mr Donne moves when he is going out to canvass , and the low , drawling voice in which he questions the people who bring him intelligence . I can see your papa standing by , ready to shake them to get out their news . "
111714	111841	111413	111413	Jemima	217	" But Mr Donne 's questions are always to the point , and force out the grain without the chaff . And look at him , if any one tells him ill news about the election ! Have you never seen a dull red light come into his eyes ? That is like my race - horse . Her flesh quivered all over , at certain sounds and noises which had some meaning to her ; but she stood quite still , pretty creature ! Now , Mr Donne is just as eager as she was , though he may be too proud to show it . Though he seems so gentle , I almost think he is very headstrong in following out his own will . "
111842	111890	111923	111923	Jemima	217	" Well ! do n't call him like a horse again , for I am sure papa would not like it . Do you know , I thought you were going to say he was like little Leonard , when you asked me who he was like . "

111953	112367	111947	111947	he	5319	" To return to Mr Bradshaw , and to give one more of his various reasons for wishing to take Mr Donne to Abermouth . The wealthy Eccleston manufacturer was uncomfortably impressed with an indefinable sense of inferiority to his visitor . It was not in education , for Mr Bradshaw was a well - educated man ; it was not in power , for , if he chose , the present object of Mr Donne 's life might be utterly defeated ; it did not arise from anything overbearing in manner , for Mr Donne was habitually polite and courteous , and was just now anxious to propitiate his host , whom he looked upon as a very useful man . Whatever this sense of inferiority arose from , Mr Bradshaw was anxious to relieve himself of it , and imagined that if he could make more display of his wealth his object would be obtained . Now his house in Eccleston was old - fashioned , and ill - calculated to exhibit money 's worth . His mode of living , though strained to a high pitch just at this time , he became aware was no more than Mr Donne was accustomed to every day of his life . The first day at dessert , some remark ( some opportune remark , as Mr Bradshaw in his innocence had thought ) was made regarding the price of pine - apples , which was rather exorbitant that year , and Mr Donne asked Mrs Bradshaw , with quiet surprise , if they had no pinery , as if to be without a pinery were indeed a depth of pitiable destitution . In fact , Mr Donne had been born and cradled in all that wealth could purchase , and so had his ancestors before him for so many generations , that refinement and luxury seemed the natural condition of man , and they that dwelt without were in the position of monsters . The absence was noticed ; but not the presence . Now , Mr Bradshaw knew that the house and grounds of Eagle 's Crag were exorbitantly dear , and yet he really thought of purchasing them . And as one means of exhibiting his wealth , and so raising himself up to the level of Mr Donne , he thought that if he could take the latter down to Abermouth , and show him the place for which , "
112379	112558	112369	112369	his	2855	" he was willing to give the fancy - price of fourteen thousand pounds , he should at last make those half - shut dreamy eyes open wide , and their owner confess that , in wealth at least , the Eccleston manufacturer stood on a par with him . All these mingled motives caused the determination which made Ruth sit in the little inn - parlour at Abermouth during the wild storm 's passage . She wondered if she had fulfilled all Mr Bradshaw 's directions . She looked at the letter . Yes ! everything was done . And now home with her news , through the wet lane , where the little pools by the roadside reflected the deep blue sky and the round white clouds with even deeper blue and clearer white ; and the rain - drops hung so thick on the trees , that even a little bird 's flight was enough to shake them down in a bright shower as of rain . When she told the news , Mary exclaimed , "

It was not a becoming day for the scenery , and the little girls regretted it much . First they hoped for a change at twelve o'clock , and then at the afternoon tide - turning .

They dug little holes near the in - coming tide , and made canals to them from the water , and blew the light sea - foam against each other ; and then stole on tiptoe near to the groups of grey and white sea - gulls , which despised their caution , flying softly and slowly away to a little distance as soon as they drew near . And in all this Ruth was as great a child as any . Only she longed for Leonard with a mother 's longing , as indeed she did every day , and all hours of the day . By - and - by the clouds thickened yet more , and one or two drops of rain were felt . It was very little , but Ruth feared a shower for her delicate Elizabeth , and besides , the September evening was fast closing in the dark and sunless day . As they turned homewards in the rapidly increasing dusk , they saw three figures on the sand near the rocks , coming in their direction . "

113260	113321	113253	113254	Mr Farquhar	193	" said Ruth . The girls looked at each other , as they always did , when Ruth mentioned Mr Farquhar 's name ; but she was perfectly unconscious both of the look and of the conjectures which gave rise to it . As soon as the two parties drew near , Mr Bradshaw called out in his strong voice , "
113349	113426	113346	113346	you	2880	" The tone of his voice assured them that he was in a bland and indulgent mood , and the two little girls ran towards him . He kissed them , and shook hands with Ruth ; told his companions that these were the little girls who were tempting him to this extravagance of purchasing Eagle 's Crag ; and then , rather doubtfully , and because he saw that Mr Donne expected it , he introduced "
113435	113538	113346	113346	you	2880	" It was growing darker every moment , and it was time they should hasten back to the rocks , which were even now indistinct in the grey haze . Mr Bradshaw held a hand of each of his daughters , and Ruth walked alongside , the two strange gentlemen being on the outskirts of the party . Mr Bradshaw began to give his little girls some home news . He told them that Mr Farquhar was ill , and could not accompany them ; but Jemima and their mamma were quite well . The gentleman nearest to Ruth spoke to her . "
113546	113565	113540	113540	you	2884	" asked he . There was no answer , so he repeated his question in a different form . "
113579	113583	113574	113574	I	0	" The reply was "
113586	114003	113574	113574	I	0	" rather breathed out in a deep inspiration than spoken in a sound . The sands heaved and trembled beneath Ruth . The figures near her vanished into strange nothingness ; the sounds of their voices were as distant sounds in a dream , while the echo of one voice thrilled through and through . She could have caught at his arm for support , in the awful dizziness which wrapped her up , body and soul . That voice ! No ! if name , and face , and figure were all changed , that voice was the same which had touched her girlish heart , which had spoken most tender words of love , which had won , and wrecked her , and which she had last heard in the low mutterings of fever . She dared not look round to see the figure of him who spoke , dark as it was . She knew he was there -- she heard him speak in the manner in which he used to address strangers years ago ; perhaps she answered him , perhaps she did not -- God knew . It seemed as if weights were tied to her feet -- as if the steadfast rocks receded -- as if time stood still;--it was so long , so terrible , that path across the reeling sand . At the foot of the rocks they separated . Mr Bradshaw , afraid lest dinner should cool , preferred the shorter way for himself and his friends . On Elizabeth 's account , the girls were to take the longer and easier path , which wound upwards through a rocky field , where larks ' nests abounded , and where wild thyme and heather were now throwing out their sweets to the soft night air . The little girls spoke in eager discussion of the strangers . They appealed to Ruth , but Ruth did not answer , and they were too impatient to convince each other to repeat the question . The first little ascent from the sands to the field surmounted , Ruth sat down suddenly and covered her face with her hands . This was so unusual -- their wishes , their good , was so invariably the rule of motion or of rest in their walks -- that the girls , suddenly checked , stood silent and affrighted in surprise . They were still more startled when Ruth wailed aloud some inarticulate words . "
114013	114070	114009	114011	dear Mrs Denbigh	156	" asked Elizabeth , gently , kneeling down on the grass by Ruth . She sat facing the west . The low watery twilight was on her face as she took her hands away . So pale , so haggard , so wild and wandering a look the girls had never seen on human countenance before . "
114088	114103	114081	114081	You	2887	" said she , shaking her head slowly . They looked at each other . "
114109	114115	114104	114104	You	2887	" said Elizabeth , soothingly . "
114144	114206	114137	114137	him	4310	" Ruth looked at her as if she did not understand the meaning of her words . No more she did at first . But by - and - by the dulled brain began to think most vividly and rapidly , and she spoke in a sharp way which deceived the girls into a belief that nothing had been the matter . "
114251	114267	114268	114268	I	0	" said she , taking Elizabeth 's hand , and holding it to her side . "
114275	114296	114268	114268	I	0	" she continued , reading pity in the child 's looks , as she felt the trembling , quivering beat . "
114369	114393	114364	114364	I	0	" said she , bending down to kiss Elizabeth , and then , before she had done so , raising her head abruptly . "
114406	114708	114401	114401	God	104	" By a strong effort at self - command , she went onwards at an even pace , neither rushing nor pausing to sob and think . The very regularity of motion calmed her . The front and back doors of the house were on two sides , at right angles with each other . They all shrunk a little from the idea of going in at the front door , now that the strange gentlemen were about , and , accordingly , they went through the quiet farm - yard right into the bright , ruddy kitchen , where the servants were dashing about with the dinner things . It was a contrast in more than colour to the lonely , dusky field , which even the little girls perceived ; and the noise , the warmth , the very bustle of the servants , were a positive relief to Ruth , and for the time lifted off the heavy press of pent - up passion . A silent house , with moonlit rooms , or with a faint gloom brooding over the apartments , would have been more to be dreaded . Then , she must have given way , and cried out . As it was , she went up the old awkward back stairs , and into the room they were to sit in . There was no candle . Mary volunteered to go down for one ; and when she returned she was full of the wonders of preparation in the drawing - room , and ready and eager to dress , so as to take her place there before the gentlemen had finished dinner . But she was struck by the strange paleness of Ruth 's face , now that the light fell upon it . "
114731	115223	114717	114717	We	2896	" Another time Ruth would have dreaded Mr Bradshaw 's displeasure ; for it was an understood thing that no one was to be ill or tired in his household without leave asked , and cause given and assigned . But she never thought of that now . Her great desire was to hold quiet till she was alone . Quietness it was not -- it was rigidity ; but she succeeded in being rigid in look and movement , and went through her duties to Elizabeth ( who preferred remaining with her upstairs ) with wooden precision . But her heart felt at times like ice , at times like burning fire ; always a heavy , heavy weight within her . At last Elizabeth went to bed . Still Ruth dared not think . Mary would come upstairs soon ; and with a strange , sick , shrinking yearning , Ruth awaited her -- and the crumbs of intelligence she might drop out about _ him _ . Ruth 's sense of hearing was quickened to miserable intensity as she stood before the chimney - piece , grasping it tight with both hands -- gazing into the dying fire , but seeing -- not the dead grey embers , or the little sparks of vivid light that ran hither and thither among the wood - ashes -- but an old farm - house , and climbing , winding road , and a little golden breezy common , with a rural inn on the hill - top , far , far away . And through the thoughts of the past came the sharp sounds of the present -- of three voices , one of which was almost silence , it was so hushed . Indifferent people would only have guessed that Mr Donne was speaking by the quietness in which the others listened ; but Ruth heard the voice and many of the words , though they conveyed no idea to her mind . She was too much stunned even to feel curious to know to what they related . _ He _ spoke . That was her one fact . Presently up came Mary , bounding , exultant . Papa had let her stay up one quarter of an hour longer , because Mr Hickson had asked . Mr Hickson was so clever ! She did not know what to make of Mr Donne , he seemed such a dawdle . But he was very handsome . Had Ruth seen him ? Oh , no ! She could not , it was so dark on those stupid sands . Well , never mind , she would see him to - morrow . She _ must _ be well to - morrow . Papa seemed a good deal put out that neither she nor Elizabeth were in the drawing - room to - night ; and his last words were , "
115229	115234	115225	115226	Mrs Denbigh	156	" ( and papa 's "

At length she was alone in her own room ! At length ! But the tension did not give way immediately . She fastened her door , and threw open the window , cold and threatening as was the night . She tore off her gown ; she put her hair back from her heated face . It seemed now as if she could not think -- as if thought and emotion had been repressed so sternly that they would not come to relieve her stupified brain . Till all at once , like a flash of lightning , her life , past and present , was revealed to her in its minutest detail . And when she saw her very present "
115416	115450	115244	115244	she	156	" the strange confusion of agony was too great to be borne , and she cried aloud . Then she was quite dead , and listened as to the sound of galloping armies . "

A still , calm night would not have soothed her as this did . The wild tattered clouds , hurrying past the moon , gave her a foolish kind of pleasure that almost made her smile a vacant smile . The blast - driven rain came on her again , and drenched her hair through and through . The words "

Of a sudden she crept to a chair , and there knelt as in the very presence of God , hiding her face , at first not speaking a word ( for did He not know her heart ) , but by - and - by moaning out , amid her sobs and tears ( and now for the first time she wept ) , "

There was a knock at the bedroom door -- a little , gentle knock , and a soft child 's voice . "

To soothe her , Ruth made a great effort ; and spoke of Leonard and his fears , and , in a low hesitating voice , she spoke of God 's tender mercy , but very humbly , for she feared lest Elizabeth should think her better and holier than she was . The little girl was soon asleep , her fears forgotten ; and Ruth , worn out by passionate emotion , and obliged to be still for fear of awaking her bedfellow , went off into a short slumber , through the depths of which the echoes of her waking sobs quivered up . When she awoke the grey light of autumnal dawn was in the room . Elizabeth slept on ; but Ruth heard the servants about , and the early farmyard sounds . After she had recovered from the shock of consciousness and recollection , she collected her thoughts with a stern calmness . He was here . In a few hours she must meet him . There was no escape , except through subterfuges and contrivances that were both false and cowardly . How it would all turn out she could not say , or even guess . But of one thing she was clear , and to one thing she would hold fast : that was , that , come what might , she would obey God 's law , and , be the end of all what it might , she would say , "

How the time would come -- what speech or action would be requisite on her part , she did not know -- she did not even try to conjecture . She left that in His hands . She was icy cold , but very calm , when the breakfast - bell rang . She went down immediately ; because she felt that there was less chance of a recognition if she were already at her place beside the tea - urn , and busied with the cups , than if she came in after all were settled . Her heart seemed to stand still , but she felt almost a strange exultant sense of power over herself . She felt , rather than saw , that he was not there . Mr Bradshaw and Mr Hickson were , and so busy talking election - politics that they did not interrupt their conversation even when they bowed to her . Her pupils sat one on each side of her . Before they were quite settled , and while the other two gentlemen yet hung over the fire , Mr Donne came in . Ruth felt as if that moment was like death . She had a kind of desire to make some sharp sound , to relieve a choking sensation , but it was over in an instant , and she sat on very composed and silent -- to all outward appearance the very model of a governess who knew her place . And by - and - by she felt strangely at ease in her sense of power . She could even listen to what was being said . She had never dared as yet to look at Mr Donne , though her heart burnt to see him once again . He sounded changed . The voice had lost its fresh and youthful eagerness of tone , though in peculiarity of modulation it was the same . It could never be mistaken for the voice of another person . There was a good deal said at that breakfast , for none seemed inclined to hurry , although it was Sunday morning . Ruth was compelled to sit there , and it was good for her that she did . That half - hour seemed to separate the present Mr Donne very effectively from her imagination of what Mr Bellingham had been . She was no analyser ; she hardly even had learnt to notice character ; but she felt there was some strange difference between the people she had lived with lately and the man who now leant back in his chair , listening in a careless manner to the conversation , but never joining in , or expressing any interest in it , unless it somewhere , or somehow , touched himself . Now , Mr Bradshaw always threw himself into a subject ; it might be in a pompous , dogmatic sort of way , but he did do it , whether it related to himself or not ; and it was part of Mr Hickson 's trade to assume an interest if he felt it not . But Mr Donne did neither the one nor the other . When the other two were talking of many of the topics of the day , he put his glass in his eye , the better to examine into the exact nature of a cold game - pie at the other side of the table . Suddenly Ruth felt that his attention was caught by her . Until now , seeing his short - sightedness , she had believed herself safe ; now her face flushed with a painful , miserable blush . But in an instant she was strong and quiet . She looked up straight at his face ; and , as if this action took him aback , he dropped his glass , and began eating away with great diligence . She had seen him . He was changed , she knew not how . In fact , the expression , which had been only occasional formerly , when his worse self predominated , had become permanent . He looked restless and dissatisfied . But he was very handsome still ; and her quick eye had recognised , with a sort of strange pride , that the eyes and mouth were like Leonard 's . Although perplexed by the straightforward , brave look she had sent right at him , he was not entirely baffled . He thought this Mrs Denbigh was certainly like poor Ruth ; but this woman was far handsomer . Her face was positively Greek ; and then such a proud , superb turn of her head ; quite queenly ! A governess in Mr Bradshaw 's family ! Why , she might be a Percy or a Howard for the grandeur of her grace ! Poor Ruth ! This woman 's hair was darker , though ; and she had less colour ; altogether a more refined - looking person . Poor Ruth ! and , for the first time for several years , he wondered what had become of her ; though , of course , there was but one thing that could have happened , and perhaps it was as well he did not know her end , for most likely it would have made him very uncomfortable . He leant back in his chair , and , unobserved ( for he would not have thought it gentlemanly to look so fixedly at her if she or any one noticed him ) , he put up his glass again . She was speaking to one of her pupils , and did not see him . By Jove ! it must be she , though ! There were little dimples came out about the mouth as she spoke , just like those he used to admire so much in Ruth , and which he had never seen in any one else -- the sunshine without the positive movement of a smile . The longer he looked the more he was convinced ; and it was with a jerk that he recovered himself enough to answer Mr Bradshaw 's question , whether he wished to go to church or not . "
118101	118141	118090	118090	I	0	" He absolutely felt jealous when Mr Hickson sprang up to open the door as Ruth and her pupils left the room . He was pleased to feel jealous again . He had been really afraid he was too much "
118145	118335	118090	118090	I	0	" for such sensations . But Hickson must keep his place . What he was paid for was doing the talking to the electors , not paying attention to the ladies in their families . Mr Donne had noticed that Mr Hickson had tried to be gallant to Miss Bradshaw ; let him , if he liked ; but let him beware how he behaved to this fair creature , Ruth or no Ruth . It certainly was Ruth ; only how the devil had she played her cards so well as to be the governess -- the respected governess , in such a family as Mr Bradshaw 's ? Mr Donne 's movements were evidently to be the guide of Mr Hickson 's . Mr Bradshaw always disliked going to church , partly from principle , partly because he never could find the places in the Prayer - book . Mr Donne was in the drawing - room as Mary came down ready equipped ; he was turning over the leaves of the large and handsome Bible . Seeing Mary , he was struck with a new idea . "

Ruth was glad when she got into the open air , and away from the house . Two hours were gone and over . Two out of a day , a day and a half -- for it might be late on Monday morning before the Eccleston party returned . She felt weak and trembling in body , but strong in power over herself . They had left the house in good time for church , so they needed not to hurry ; and they went leisurely along the road , now and then passing some country person whom they knew , and with whom they exchanged a kindly , placid greeting . But presently , to Ruth 's dismay , she heard a step behind , coming at a rapid pace , a peculiar clank of rather high - heeled boots , which gave a springy sound to the walk , that she had known well long ago . It was like a nightmare , where the Evil dreaded is never avoided , never completely shunned , but is by one 's side at the very moment of triumph in escape . There he was by her side ; and there was a quarter of a mile intervening between her and the church ; but even yet she trusted that he had not recognised her . "
118759	118765	118750	118750	I	0	" said he , quietly . "
118832	118892	118823	118823	I	0	" That speech required no positive answer of any kind ; and no answer did it receive . He had not expected a reply . He knew , if she were Ruth , she could not answer any indifferent words of his ; and her silence made him more certain of her identity with the lady by his side . "
118932	118941	118942	118942	You	2932	" He breathed deeply , and then added , "
118951	119033	118942	118942	You	2932	" He spoke low ; almost in a whisper . The little church - bell began to call the lagging people with its quick , sharp summons . Ruth writhed in body and spirit , but struggled on . The church - door would be gained at last ; and in that holy place she would find peace . He repeated in a louder tone , so as to compel an answer in order to conceal her agitation from the girls : "
119041	119044	118942	118942	You	2932	" He used "
119046	119049	118942	118942	You	2932	" instead of "
119052	119081	118942	118942	You	2932	" and laid the emphasis on that word , in order to mark his meaning to Ruth , and Ruth only . But he drove her to bay . "
119090	119101	119082	119082	I	0	" she replied , in a calm , grave tone . "
119147	119201	119128	119128	I	0	" The little girls wondered how Mrs Denbigh could speak in such a tone of quiet authority to Mr Donne , who was almost a member of Parliament . But they settled that her husband must have died in Wales , and , of course , that would make the recollection of the country "
119205	119814	119128	119128	I	0	" as she said . Mr Donne did not dislike the answer , and he positively admired the dignity with which she spoke . His leaving her as he did must have made her very miserable ; and he liked the pride that made her retain her indignation , until he could speak to her in private , and explain away a good deal of what she might complain of with some justice . The church was reached . They all went up the middle aisle into the Eagle 's Crag pew . He followed them in , entered himself , and shut the door . Ruth 's heart sank as she saw him there ; just opposite to her ; coming between her and the clergyman who was to read out the Word of God . It was merciless -- it was cruel to haunt her there . She durst not lift her eyes to the bright eastern light -- she could not see how peacefully the marble images of the dead lay on their tombs , for he was between her and all Light and Peace . She knew that his look was on her ; that he never turned his glance away . She could not join in the prayer for the remission of sins while he was there , for his very presence seemed as a sign that their stain would never be washed out of her life . But , although goaded and chafed by her thoughts and recollections , she kept very still . No sign of emotion , no flush of colour was on her face as he looked at her . Elizabeth could not find her place , and then Ruth breathed once , long and deeply , as she moved up the pew , and out of the straight , burning glance of those eyes of evil meaning . When they sat down for the reading of the first lesson , Ruth turned the corner of the seat so as no longer to be opposite to him . She could not listen . The words seemed to be uttered in some world far away , from which she was exiled and cast out ; their sound , and yet more their meaning , was dim and distant . But in this extreme tension of mind to hold in her bewildered agony , it so happened that one of her senses was preternaturally acute . While all the church and the people swam in misty haze , one point in a dark corner grew clearer and clearer till she saw ( what at another time she could not have discerned at all ) a face -- a gargoyle I think they call it -- at the end of the arch next to the narrowing of the nave into the chancel , and in the shadow of that contraction . The face was beautiful in feature ( the next to it was a grinning monkey ) , but it was not the features that were the most striking part . There was a half - open mouth , not in any way distorted out of its exquisite beauty by the intense expression of suffering it conveyed . Any distortion of the face by mental agony implies that a struggle with circumstance is going on . But in this face , if such struggle had been , it was over now . Circumstance had conquered ; and there was no hope from mortal endeavour , or help from mortal creature to be had . But the eyes looked onward and upward to the "
119822	120182	120183	120183	I	0	" And though the parted lips seemed ready to quiver with agony , yet the expression of the whole face , owing to these strange , stony , and yet spiritual eyes , was high and consoling . If mortal gaze had never sought its meaning before , in the deep shadow where it had been placed long centuries ago , yet Ruth 's did now . Who could have imagined such a look ? Who could have witnessed -- perhaps felt -- such infinite sorrow , and yet dared to lift it up by Faith into a peace so pure ? Or was it a mere conception ? If so , what a soul the unknown carver must have had ! for creator and handicraftsman must have been one ; no two minds could have been in such perfect harmony . Whatever it was -- however it came there -- imaginer , carver , sufferer , all were long passed away . Human art was ended -- human life done -- human suffering over ; but this remained ; it stilled Ruth 's beating heart to look on it . She grew still enough to hear words which have come to many in their time of need , and awed them in the presence of the extremest suffering that the hushed world has ever heard of . The second lesson for the morning of the 25th of September is the 26th chapter of St Matthew 's Gospel . And when they prayed again , Ruth 's tongue was unloosed , and she also could pray , in His name , who underwent the agony in the garden . As they came out of church , there was a little pause and gathering at the door . It had begun to rain ; those who had umbrellas were putting them up ; those who had not were regretting , and wondering how long it would last . Standing for a moment , impeded by the people who were thus collected under the porch , Ruth heard a voice close to her say , very low , but very distinctly , "
120204	120287	120195	120195	I	0	" Ruth did not reply . She would not acknowledge that she heard ; but she trembled nevertheless , for the well - remembered voice was low and soft , and had yet its power to thrill . She earnestly desired to know why and how he had left her . It appeared to her as if that knowledge could alone give her a relief from the restless wondering that distracted her mind , and that one explanation could do no harm . "
120292	120299	120195	120195	I	0	" the higher spirit made answer ; "
120307	120325	120326	120326	Mary	118	" Ruth and the girls had each an umbrella . She turned to Mary , and said , "
120340	120383	120384	120384	You	118	" Her way of speaking was short and decided ; she was compressing her meaning into as few words as possible . The little girl obeyed in silence . As they went first through the churchyard stile , Mr Donne spoke again . "
120388	120392	120384	120384	You	118	" said he . "
120431	121235	120428	120428	I	0	" He spoke in a tone of soft complaint . But he himself had done much to destroy the illusion which had hung about his memory for years , whenever Ruth had allowed herself to think of it . Besides which , during the time of her residence in the Benson family , her feeling of what people ought to be had been unconsciously raised and refined ; and Mr Donne , even while she had to struggle against the force of past recollections , repelled her so much by what he was at present , that every speech of his , every minute they were together , served to make her path more and more easy to follow . His voice retained something of its former influence . When he spoke , without her seeing him , she could not help remembering former days . She did not answer this last speech any more than the first . She saw clearly , that , putting aside all thought as to the character of their former relationship , it had been dissolved by his will -- his act and deed ; and that , therefore , the power to refuse any further intercourse whatsoever remained with her . It sometimes seems a little strange how , after having earnestly prayed to be delivered from temptation , and having given ourselves with shut eyes into God 's hand , from that time every thought , every outward influence , every acknowledged law of life , seems to lead us on from strength to strength . It seems strange sometimes , because we notice the coincidence ; but it is the natural , unavoidable consequence of all truth and goodness being one and the same , and therefore carried out in every circumstance , external and internal , of God 's creation . When Mr Donne saw that Ruth would not answer him , he became only the more determined that she should hear what he had to say . What that was he did not exactly know . The whole affair was most mysterious and piquant . The umbrella protected Ruth from more than the rain on that walk homewards , for under its shelter she could not be spoken to unheard . She had not rightly understood at what time she and the girls were to dine . From the gathering at meal - times she must not shrink . She must show no sign of weakness . But , oh ! the relief , after that walk , to sit in her own room , locked up , so that neither Mary nor Elizabeth could come by surprise , and to let her weary frame ( weary with being so long braced up to rigidity and stiff quiet ) fall into a chair anyhow -- all helpless , nerveless , motionless , as if the very bones had melted out of her ! The peaceful rest which her mind took was in thinking of Leonard . She dared not look before or behind , but she could see him well at present . She brooded over the thought of him , till she dreaded his father more and more . By the light of her child 's purity and innocence , she saw evil clearly , and yet more clearly . She thought that , if Leonard ever came to know the nature of his birth , she had nothing for it but to die out of his sight . He could never know -- human heart could never know , her ignorant innocence , and all the small circumstances which had impelled her onwards . But God knew . And if Leonard heard of his mother 's error , why , nothing remained but death ; for she felt , then , as if she had it in her power to die innocently out of such future agony ; but that escape is not so easy . Suddenly a fresh thought came , and she prayed that , through whatever suffering , she might be purified . Whatever trials , woes , measureless pangs , God might see fit to chastise her with , she would not shrink , if only at last she might come into His presence in Heaven . Alas ! the shrinking from suffering we can not help . That part of her prayer was vain . And as for the rest , was not the sure justice of His law finding her out even now ? His laws once broken , His justice and the very nature of those laws bring the immutable retribution ; but if we turn penitently to Him , He enables us to bear our punishment with a meek and docile heart , "
121243	121661	121662	121662	They	2945	" Mr Bradshaw had felt himself rather wanting in proper attention to his guest , inasmuch as he had been unable , all in a minute , to comprehend Mr Donne 's rapid change of purpose ; and , before it had entered into his mind that , notwithstanding the distance of the church , Mr Donne was going thither , that gentleman was out of the sight , and far out of the reach , of his burly host . But though the latter had so far neglected the duties of hospitality as to allow his visitor to sit in the Eagle 's Crag pew with no other guard of honour than the children and the governess , Mr Bradshaw determined to make up for it by extra attention during the remainder of the day . Accordingly he never left Mr Donne . Whatever wish that gentleman expressed , it was the study of his host to gratify . Did he hint at the pleasure which a walk in such beautiful scenery would give him , Mr Bradshaw was willing to accompany him , although at Eccleston it was a principle with him not to take any walks for pleasure on a Sunday . When Mr Donne turned round , and recollected letters which must be written , and which would compel him to stay at home , Mr Bradshaw instantly gave up the walk , and remained at hand , ready to furnish him with any writing - materials which could be wanted , and which were not laid out in the half - furnished house . Nobody knew where Mr Hickson was all this time . He had sauntered out after Mr Donne , when the latter set off for church , and he had never returned . Mr Donne kept wondering if he could have met Ruth -- if , in fact , she had gone out with her pupils , now that the afternoon had cleared up . This uneasy wonder , and a few mental imprecations on his host 's polite attention , together with the letter - writing pretence , passed away the afternoon -- the longest afternoon he had ever spent ; and of weariness he had had his share . Lunch was lingering in the dining - room , left there for the truant Mr Hickson ; but of the children or Ruth there was no sign . He ventured on a distant inquiry as to their whereabouts . "
121704	121717	121718	121719	Mrs Denbigh	156	" Mr Donne was on the point of asking some further questions about "
121721	121868	121718	121719	Mrs Denbigh	156	" when Mr Hickson came in , loud - spoken , cheerful , hungry , and as ready to talk about his ramble , and the way in which he had lost and found himself , as he was about everything else . He knew how to dress up the commonest occurrence with a little exaggeration , a few puns , and a happy quotation or two , so as to make it sound very agreeable . He could read faces , and saw that he had been missed ; both host and visitor looked moped to death . He determined to devote himself to their amusement during the remainder of the day , for he had really lost himself , and felt that he had been away too long on a dull Sunday , when people were apt to get hypped if not well amused . "
121935	122072	122385	122385	I	0	" Mr Donne languidly assented to this proposal of going out ; and then he became restless until Mr Hickson had eaten a hasty lunch , for he hoped to meet Ruth on the way from church , to be near her , and watch her , though he might not be able to speak to her . To have the slow hours roll away -- to know he must leave the next day -- and yet , so close to her , not to be seeing her -- was more than he could bear . In an impetuous kind of way , he disregarded all Mr Hickson 's offers of guidance to lovely views , and turned a deaf ear to Mr Bradshaw 's expressed wish of showing him the land belonging to the house ( "
122079	122384	122385	122385	I	0	" ) , and set off wilfully on the road leading to the church , from which , he averred , he had seen a view which nothing else about the place could equal . They met the country people dropping homewards . No Ruth was there . She and her pupils had returned by the field - way , as Mr Bradshaw informed his guests at dinner - time . Mr Donne was very captious all through dinner . He thought it would never be over , and cursed Hickson 's interminable stories , which were told on purpose to amuse him . His heart gave a fierce bound when he saw her in the drawing - room with the little girls . She was reading to them -- with how sick and trembling a heart , no words can tell . But she could master and keep down outward signs of her emotion . An hour more to - night ( part of which was to be spent in family prayer , and all in the safety of company ) , another hour in the morning ( when all would be engaged in the bustle of departure)--if , during this short space of time , she could not avoid speaking to him , she could at least keep him at such a distance as to make him feel that henceforward her world and his belonged to separate systems , wide as the heavens apart . By degrees she felt that he was drawing near to where she stood . He was by the table examining the books that lay upon it . Mary and Elizabeth drew off a little space , awe - stricken by the future member for Eccleston . As he bent his head over a book , he said , "
122393	122429	122385	122385	I	0	" The little girls could not hear ; but Ruth , hemmed in so that no escape was possible , did hear . She took sudden courage , and said , in a clear voice , "
122444	122878	122431	122431	you	2954	" Mr Hickson , hovering at no great distance , heard these words , and drew near to second Mrs Denbigh 's request . Mr Bradshaw , who was very sleepy after his unusually late dinner , and longing for bedtime , joined in the request , for it would save the necessity for making talk , and he might , perhaps , get in a nap , undisturbed and unnoticed , before the servants came in to prayers . Mr Donne was caught ; he was obliged to read aloud , although he did not know what he was reading . In the middle of some sentence the door opened , a rush of servants came in , and Mr Bradshaw became particularly wide awake in an instant , and read them a long sermon with great emphasis and unction , winding up with a prayer almost as long . Ruth sat with her head drooping , more from exhaustion after a season of effort than because she shunned Mr Donne 's looks . He had so lost his power over her -- his power , which had stirred her so deeply the night before -- that , except as one knowing her error and her shame , and making a cruel use of such knowledge , she had quite separated him from the idol of her youth . And yet , for the sake of that first and only love , she would gladly have known what explanation he could offer to account for leaving her . It would have been something gained to her own self - respect , if she had learnt that he was not then , as she felt him to be now , cold and egotistical , caring for no one and nothing but what related to himself . Home , and Leonard -- how strangely peaceful the two seemed ! Oh , for the rest that a dream about Leonard would bring ! Mary and Elizabeth went to bed immediately after prayers , and Ruth accompanied them . It was planned that the gentlemen should leave early the next morning . They were to breakfast half an hour sooner , to catch the railway train ; and this by Mr Donne 's own arrangement , who had been as eager about his canvassing , the week before , as it was possible for him to be , but who now wished Eccleston and the Dissenting interest therein very fervently at the devil . Just as the carriage came round , Mr Bradshaw turned to Ruth : "
122893	122929	122882	122882	Leonard	104	" Ruth gasped -- for she saw Mr Donne catch at the name ; she did not guess the sudden sharp jealousy called out by the idea that Leonard was a grown - up man . "

122960	122992	122954	122955	Mrs Denbigh	156	" answered Mary . Under some pretence or other , he drew near to Ruth ; and in that low voice , which she had learnt to loathe , he said , "
122996	123052	122954	122955	Mrs Denbigh	156	" By the white misery that turned her face to stone -- by the wild terror in her imploring eyes -- by the gasping breath which came out as the carriage drove away -- he knew that he had seized the spell to make her listen at last . CHAPTER XXIV The Meeting on the Sands "
123069	123158	123159	123159	Child	895	" These words rang like a tolling bell through Ruth 's head . It seemed to her that her doom was certain . Leonard would be taken from her ! She had a firm conviction -- not the less firm because she knew not on what it was based -- that a child , whether legitimate or not , belonged of legal right to the father . And Leonard , of all children , was the prince and monarch . Every man 's heart would long to call Leonard "
123161	123211	123061	123061	He	2958	" She had been too strongly taxed to have much power left her to reason coolly and dispassionately , just then , even if she had been with any one who could furnish her with information from which to draw correct conclusions . The one thought haunted her night and day--"He
123220	123564	123061	123061	He	2958	" In her dreams she saw Leonard borne away into some dim land , to which she could not follow . Sometimes he sat in a swiftly - moving carriage , at his father 's side , and smiled on her as he passed by , as if going to promised pleasure . At another time he was struggling to return to her ; stretching out his little arms , and crying to her for the help she could not give . How she got through the days , she did not know ; her body moved about and habitually acted , but her spirit was with her child . She thought often of writing and warning Mr Benson of Leonard 's danger ; but then she shrank from recurring to circumstances , all mention of which had ceased years ago ; the very recollection of which seemed buried deep for ever . Besides , she feared occasioning discord or commotion in the quiet circle in which she lived . Mr Benson 's deep anger against her betrayer had been shown too clearly in the old time to allow her to think that he would keep it down without expression now . He would cease to do anything to forward his election ; he would oppose him as much as he could ; and Mr Bradshaw would be angry , and a storm would arise , from the bare thought of which Ruth shrank with the cowardliness of a person thoroughly worn out with late contest . She was bodily wearied with her spiritual buffeting . One morning , three or four days after their departure , she received a letter from Miss Benson . She could not open it at first , and put it on one side , clenching her hand over it all the time . At last she tore it open . Leonard was safe as yet . There were a few lines in his great round hand , speaking of events no larger than the loss of a beautiful "

124322	124470	124305	124305	I	0	" Although a stranger might have considered this letter wearisome from the multiplicity of the details , Ruth craved greedily after more . What had Mr Donne said to Leonard ? Had Leonard liked his new acquaintance ? Were they likely to meet again ? After wondering and wondering over these points , Ruth composed herself by the hope that in a day or two she should hear again ; and to secure this end , she answered the letters by return of post . That was on Thursday . On Friday she had another letter , in a strange hand . It was from Mr Donne . No name , no initials were given . If it had fallen into another person 's hands , they could not have recognised the writer , nor guessed to whom it was sent . It contained simply these words : "

Either way she dreaded . She was very nearly leaving the letter altogether unanswered . But suddenly she resolved she would know all , the best , the worst . No cowardly dread of herself , or of others , should make her neglect aught that came to her in her child 's name . She took up a pen and wrote : "

She knew them too well to distrust their doing what they were told . She sat still , her head bowed on her arms for a few minutes , and then rose up and went to put on her walking things . Some thoughts impelled her to sudden haste . She crossed the field by the side of the house , ran down the steep and rocky path , and was carried by the impetus of her descent far out on the level sands -- but not far enough for her intent . Without looking to the right hand or to the left , where comers might be seen , she went forwards to the black posts , which , rising above the heaving waters , marked where the fishermen 's nets were laid . She went straight towards this place , and hardly stinted her pace even where the wet sands were glittering with the receding waves . Once there , she turned round , and in a darting glance , saw that as yet no one was near . She was perhaps half - a - mile or more from the grey , silvery rocks , which sloped away into brown moorland , interspersed with a field here and there of golden , waving corn . Behind were purple hills , with sharp , clear outlines , touching the sky . A little on one side from where she stood , she saw the white cottages and houses which formed the village of Abermouth , scattered up and down , and , on a windy hill , about a mile inland , she saw the little grey church , where even now many were worshipping in peace . "

And now , close under the heathery fields , where they fell softly down and touched the sands , she saw a figure moving in the direction of the great shadow made by the rocks -- going towards the very point where the path from Eagle 's Crag came down to the shore . "
125220	125456	125218	125218	he	3002	" said she to herself . And she turned round and looked seaward . The tide had turned ; the waves were slowly receding , as if loath to lose the hold they had , so lately , and with such swift bounds , gained on the yellow sands . The eternal moan they have made since the world began filled the ear , broken only by the skirl of the grey sea - birds as they alighted in groups on the edge of the waters , or as they rose up with their measured , balancing motion , and the sunlight caught their white breasts . There was no sign of human life to be seen ; no boat , or distant sail , or near shrimper . The black posts there were all that spoke of men 's work or labour . Beyond a stretch of the waters , a few pale grey hills showed like films ; their summits clear , though faint , their bases lost in a vapoury mist . On the hard , echoing sands , and distinct from the ceaseless murmur of the salt sea waves , came footsteps -- nearer -- nearer . Very near they were when Ruth , unwilling to show the fear that rioted in her heart , turned round , and faced Mr Donne . He came forward , with both hands extended . "

He was so struck anew by her beauty , and understood her so little , that he believed that she only required a little more urging to consent to what he wished ; for in all she had said there was no trace of the anger and resentment for his desertion of her , which he had expected would be a prominent feature -- the greatest obstacle he had to encounter .

She did not turn round for some time after she was fairly lost to the sight of any one on the shore ; she clambered on , almost stunned by the rapid beating of her heart . Her eyes were hot and dry ; and at last became as if she were suddenly blind . Unable to go on , she tottered into the tangled underwood which grew among the stones , filling every niche and crevice , and little shelving space , with green and delicate tracery . She sank down behind a great overhanging rock , which hid her from any one coming up the path . An ash - tree was rooted in this rock , slanting away from the sea - breezes that were prevalent in most weathers ; but this was a still , autumnal Sabbath evening . As Ruth 's limbs fell , so they lay . She had no strength , no power of volition to move a finger . She could not think or remember . She was literally stunned . The first sharp sensation which roused her from her torpor was a quick desire to see him once more ; up she sprang , and climbed to an out - jutting dizzy point of rock , but a little above her sheltered nook , yet commanding a wide view over the bare , naked sands;--far away below , touching the rippling water - line , was Stephen Bromley , busily gathering in his nets ; besides him there was no living creature visible . Ruth shaded her eyes , as if she thought they might have deceived her ; but no , there was no one there . She went slowly down to her old place , crying sadly as she went . "
129216	129378	129207	129207	I	0	" She could not take in the general view and scope of their conversation -- the event was too near her for that ; but her heart felt sore at the echo of her last words , just and true as their severity was . Her struggle , her constant flowing tears , which fell from very weakness , made her experience a sensation of intense bodily fatigue ; and her soul had lost the power of throwing itself forward , or contemplating anything beyond the dreary present , when the expanse of grey , wild , bleak moors , stretching wide away below a sunless sky , seemed only an outward sign of the waste world within her heart , for which she could claim no sympathy;--for she could not even define what its woes were ; and if she could , no one would understand how the present time was haunted by the terrible ghost of the former love .

129410	130030	129384	129384	I	0	" She shut her eyes , until through the closed lids came a ruddy blaze of light . The clouds had parted away , and the sun was going down in a crimson glory behind the distant purple hills . The whole western sky was one flame of fire . Ruth forgot herself in looking at the gorgeous sight . She sat up gazing , and , as she gazed , the tears dried on her cheeks ; and , somehow , all human care and sorrow were swallowed up in the unconscious sense of God 's infinity . The sunset calmed her more than any words , however wise and tender , could have done . It even seemed to give her strength and courage ; she did not know how or why , but so it was . She rose , and went slowly towards home . Her limbs were very stiff , and every now and then she had to choke down an unbidden sob . Her pupils had been long returned from church , and had busied themselves in preparing tea -- an occupation which had probably made them feel the time less long . If they had ever seen a sleep - walker , they might have likened Ruth to one for the next few days , so slow and measured did her movements seem -- so far away was her intelligence from all that was passing around her -- so hushed and strange were the tones of her voice . They had letters from home announcing the triumphant return of Mr Donne as M.P. for Eccleston . Mrs Denbigh heard the news without a word , and was too languid to join in the search after purple and yellow flowers with which to deck the sitting - room at Eagle 's Crag . A letter from Jemima came the next day , summoning them home . Mr Donne and his friends had left the place , and quiet was restored in the Bradshaw household ; so it was time that Mary 's and Elizabeth 's holiday should cease . Mrs Denbigh had also a letter -- a letter from Miss Benson , saying that Leonard was not quite well . There was so much pains taken to disguise anxiety , that it was very evident much anxiety was felt ; and the girls were almost alarmed by Ruth 's sudden change from taciturn langour to eager , vehement energy . Body and mind seemed strained to exertion . Every plan that could facilitate packing and winding - up affairs at Abermouth , every errand and arrangement that could expedite their departure by one minute , was done by Ruth with stern promptitude . She spared herself in nothing . She made them rest , made them lie down , while she herself lifted weights and transacted business with feverish power , never resting , and trying never to have time to think . For in remembrance of the Past there was Remorse,--how had she forgotten Leonard these last few days!--how had she repined and been dull of heart to her blessing ! And in anticipation of the Future there was one sharp point of red light in the darkness which pierced her brain with agony , and which she would not see or recognise -- and saw and recognised all the more for such mad determination -- which is not the true shield against the bitterness of the arrows of Death . When the seaside party arrived in Eccleston , they were met by Mrs and Miss Bradshaw and Mr Benson . By a firm resolution , Ruth kept from shaping the question , "
130035	130055	130032	130032	he	3058	" as if by giving shape to her fears she made their realisation more imminent . She said merely , "

His member had been returned ; his proud opponents mortified . So the public thought he ought to be well pleased ; but the public were disappointed to see that he did not show any of the gratification they supposed him to feel . The truth was , that he had met with so many small mortifications during the progress of the election , that the pleasure which he would otherwise have felt in the final success of his scheme was much diminished . He had more than tacitly sanctioned bribery ; and now that the excitement was over , he regretted it ; not entirely from conscientious motives , though he was uneasy from a slight sense of wrong - doing ; but he was more pained , after all , to think that , in the eyes of some of his townsmen , his hitherto spotless character had received a blemish . He , who had been so stern and severe a censor on the undue influence exercised by the opposite party in all preceding elections , could not expect to be spared by their adherents now , when there were rumours that the hands of the scrupulous Dissenters were not clean . Before , it had been his boast that neither friend nor enemy could say one word against him ; now , he was constantly afraid of an indictment for bribery , and of being compelled to appear before a Committee to swear to his own share in the business . His uneasy , fearful consciousness made him stricter and sterner than ever ; as if he would quench all wondering , slanderous talk about him in the town by a renewed austerity of uprightness ; that the slack - principled Mr Bradshaw of one month of ferment and excitement might not be confounded with the highly - conscientious and deeply - religious Mr Bradshaw , who went to chapel twice a day , and gave a hundred pounds a - piece to every charity in the town , as a sort of thank - offering that his end was gained . But he was secretly dissatisfied with Mr Donne . In general , that gentleman had been rather too willing to act in accordance with any one 's advice , no matter whose ; as if he had thought it too much trouble to weigh the wisdom of his friends , in which case Mr Bradshaw 's would have , doubtless , proved the most valuable . But now and then he unexpectedly , and utterly without reason , took the conduct of affairs into his own hands , as when he had been absent without leave only just before the day of nomination . No one guessed whither he had gone ; but the fact of his being gone was enough to chagrin Mr Bradshaw , who was quite ready to pick a quarrel on this very head , if the election had not terminated favourably . As it was , he had a feeling of proprietorship in Mr Donne which was not disagreeable . He had given the new M.P. his seat ; his resolution , his promptitude , his energy , had made Mr Donne "
130674	130924	130671	130672	our member	3062	" and Mr Bradshaw began to feel proud of him accordingly . But there had been no one circumstance during this period to bind Jemima and Mr Farquhar together . They were still misunderstanding each other with all their power . The difference in the result was this : Jemima loved him all the more , in spite of quarrels and coolness . He was growing utterly weary of the petulant temper of which he was never certain ; of the reception which varied day after day , according to the mood she was in and the thoughts that were uppermost ; and he was almost startled to find how very glad he was that the little girls and Mrs Denbigh were coming home . His was a character to bask in peace ; and lovely , quiet Ruth , with her low tones and quiet replies , her delicate waving movements , appeared to him the very type of what a woman should be -- a calm , serene soul , fashioning the body to angelic grace . It was , therefore , with no slight interest that Mr Farquhar inquired daily after the health of little Leonard . He asked at the Bensons ' house ; and Sally answered him , with swollen and tearful eyes , that the child was very bad -- very bad indeed . He asked at the doctor 's ; and the doctor told him , in a few short words , that "
131003	131008	131000	131000	his	4193	" continued the doctor , "
131037	132040	132043	132043	you	3067	" But as he ended his speech he sighed ; and Mr Farquhar was none the less convinced that common report was true , which represented the clever , prosperous surgeon of Eccleston as bitterly disappointed at his failure of offspring . While these various interests and feelings had their course outside the Chapel - house , within there was but one thought which possessed all the inmates . When Sally was not cooking for the little invalid , she was crying ; for she had had a dream about green rushes , not three months ago , which , by some queer process of oneiromancy she interpreted to mean the death of a child ; and all Miss Benson 's endeavours were directed to making her keep silence to Ruth about this dream . Sally thought that the mother ought to be told ; what were dreams sent for but for warnings ? But it was just like a pack of Dissenters , who would not believe anything like other folks . Miss Benson was too much accustomed to Sally 's contempt for Dissenters , as viewed from the pinnacle of the Establishment , to pay much attention to all this grumbling ; especially as Sally was willing to take as much trouble about Leonard as if she believed he was going to live , and that his recovery depended upon her care . Miss Benson 's great object was to keep her from having any confidential talks with Ruth ; as if any repetition of the dream could have deepened the conviction in Ruth 's mind that the child would die . It seemed to her that his death would only be the fitting punishment for the state of indifference towards him -- towards life and death -- towards all things earthly or divine , into which she had suffered herself to fall since her last interview with Mr Donne . She did not understand that such exhaustion is but the natural consequence of violent agitation and severe tension of feeling . The only relief she experienced was in constantly serving Leonard ; she had almost an animal 's jealousy lest any one should come between her and her young . Mr Benson saw this jealous suspicion , although he could hardly understand it ; but he calmed his sister 's wonder and officious kindness , so that the two patiently and quietly provided all that Ruth might want , but did not interfere with her right to nurse Leonard . But when he was recovering , Mr Benson , with the slight tone of authority he knew how to assume when need was , bade Ruth lie down and take some rest , while his sister watched . Ruth did not answer , but obeyed in a dull , weary kind of surprise at being so commanded . She lay down by her child , gazing her fill at his calm slumber ; and as she gazed , her large white eyelids were softly pressed down as with a gentle irresistible weight , and she fell asleep . She dreamed that she was once more on the lonely shore , striving to carry Leonard away from some pursuer -- some human pursuer -- she knew he was human , and she knew who he was , although she dared not say his name even to herself , he seemed so close and present , gaining on her flying footsteps , rushing after her as with the sound of the roaring tide . Her feet seemed heavy weights fixed to the ground ; they would not move . All at once , just near the shore , a great black whirlwind of waves clutched her back to her pursuer ; she threw Leonard on to land , which was safety ; but whether he reached it or no , or was swept back like her into a mysterious something too dreadful to be borne , she did not know , for the terror awakened her . At first the dream seemed yet a reality , and she thought that the pursuer was couched even there , in that very room , and the great boom of the sea was still in her ears . But as full consciousness returned , she saw herself safe in the dear old room -- the haven of rest -- the shelter from storms . A bright fire was glowing in the little old - fashioned , cup - shaped grate , niched into a corner of the wall , and guarded on either side by whitewashed bricks , which rested on hobs . On one of these the kettle hummed and buzzed , within two points of boiling whenever she or Leonard required tea . In her dream that home - like sound had been the roaring of the relentless sea , creeping swiftly on to seize its prey . Miss Benson sat by the fire , motionless and still ; it was too dark to read any longer without a candle ; but yet on the ceiling and upper part of the walls the golden light of the setting sun was slowly moving -- so slow , and yet a motion gives the feeling of rest to the weary yet more than perfect stillness . The old clock on the staircase told its monotonous click - clack , in that soothing way which more marked the quiet of the house than disturbed with any sense of sound . Leonard still slept that renovating slumber , almost in her arms , far from that fatal pursuing sea , with its human form of cruelty . The dream was a vision ; the reality which prompted the dream was over and past -- Leonard was safe -- she was safe ; all this loosened the frozen springs , and they gushed forth in her heart , and her lips moved in accordance with her thoughts . "
132049	132092	132043	132043	you	3067	" said Miss Benson , who caught sight of the motion , and fancied she was asking for something . Miss Benson bent over the side of the bed on which Ruth lay , to catch the low tones of her voice . "

132161	132743	132746	132746	her	3073	" Leonard strode on to perfect health ; but he was made older in character and looks by his severe illness . He grew tall and thin , and the lovely child was lost in the handsome boy . He began to wonder , and to question . Ruth mourned a little over the vanished babyhood , when she was all in all , and over the childhood , whose petals had fallen away ; it seemed as though two of her children were gone -- the one an infant , the other a bright , thoughtless darling ; and she wished that they could have remained quick in her memory for ever , instead of being absorbed in loving pride for the present boy . But these were only fanciful regrets , flitting like shadows across a mirror . Peace and thankfulness were once more the atmosphere of her mind ; nor was her unconsciousness disturbed by any suspicion of Mr Farquhar 's increasing approbation and admiration , which he was diligently nursing up into love for her . She knew that he had sent -- she did not know how often he had brought -- fruit for the convalescent Leonard . She heard , on her return from her daily employment , that Mr Farquhar had brought a little gentle pony on which Leonard , weak as he was , might ride . To confess the truth , her maternal pride was such that she thought that all kindness shown to such a boy as Leonard was but natural ; she believed him to be A child whom all that looked on , loved . As in truth he was ; and the proof of this was daily shown in many kind inquiries , and many thoughtful little offerings , besides Mr Farquhar 's . The poor ( warm and kind of heart to all sorrow common to humanity ) were touched with pity for the young widow , whose only child lay ill , and nigh unto death . They brought what they could -- a fresh egg , when eggs were scarce -- a few ripe pears that grew on the sunniest side of the humblest cottage , where the fruit was regarded as a source of income -- a call of inquiry , and a prayer that God would spare the child , from an old crippled woman , who could scarcely drag herself so far as the Chapel - house , yet felt her worn and weary heart stirred with a sharp pang of sympathy , and a very present remembrance of the time when she too was young , and saw the life - breath quiver out of her child , now an angel in that heaven which felt more like home to the desolate old creature than this empty earth . To all such , when Leonard was better , Ruth went , and thanked them from her heart . She and the old cripple sat hand in hand over the scanty fire on the hearth of the latter , while she told in solemn , broken , homely words , how her child sickened and died . Tears fell like rain down Ruth 's cheeks ; but those of the old woman were dry . All tears had been wept out of her long ago , and now she sat patient and quiet , waiting for death . But after this , Ruth "
132748	134777	132746	132746	her	3073	" and the two were henceforward a pair of friends . Mr Farquhar was only included in the general gratitude which she felt towards all who had been kind to her boy . The winter passed away in deep peace after the storms of the autumn , yet every now and then a feeling of insecurity made Ruth shake for an instant . Those wild autumnal storms had torn aside the quiet flowers and herbage that had gathered over the wreck of her early life , and shown her that all deeds , however hidden and long passed by , have their eternal consequences . She turned sick and faint whenever Mr Donne 's name was casually mentioned . No one saw it ; but she felt the miserable stop in her heart 's beating , and wished that she could prevent it by any exercise of self - command . She had never named his identity with Mr Bellingham , nor had she spoken about the seaside interview . Deep shame made her silent and reserved on all her life before Leonard 's birth ; from that time she rose again in her self - respect , and spoke as openly as a child ( when need was ) of all occurrences which had taken place since then ; except that she could not , and would not , tell of this mocking echo , this haunting phantom , this past , that would not rest in its grave . The very circumstance that it was stalking abroad in the world , and might reappear at any moment , made her a coward : she trembled away from contemplating what the reality had been ; only she clung more faithfully than before to the thought of the great God , who was a rock in the dreary land , where no shadow was . Autumn and winter , with their lowering skies , were less dreary than the woeful , desolate feelings that shed a gloom on Jemima . She found too late that she had considered Mr Farquhar so securely her own for so long a time , that her heart refused to recognise him as lost to her , unless her reason went through the same weary , convincing , miserable evidence day after day , and hour after hour . He never spoke to her now , except from common civility . He never cared for her contradictions ; he never tried , with patient perseverance , to bring her over to his opinions ; he never used the wonted wiles ( so tenderly remembered now they had no existence but in memory ) to bring her round out of some wilful mood -- and such moods were common enough now ! Frequently she was sullenly indifferent to the feelings of others -- not from any unkindness , but because her heart seemed numb and stony , and incapable of sympathy . Then afterwards her self - reproach was terrible -- in the dead of night , when no one saw it . With a strange perversity , the only intelligence she cared to hear , the only sights she cared to see , were the circumstances which gave confirmation to the idea that Mr Farquhar was thinking of Ruth for a wife . She craved with stinging curiosity to hear something of their affairs every day ; partly because the torture which such intelligence gave was almost a relief from the deadness of her heart to all other interests . And so spring ( _ gioventu dell'anno _ ) came back to her , bringing all the contrasts which spring alone can bring to add to the heaviness of the soul . The little winged creatures filled the air with bursts of joy ; the vegetation came bright and hopefully onwards , without any check of nipping frost . The ash - trees in the Bradshaws ' garden were out in leaf by the middle of May , which that year wore more the aspect of summer than most Junes do . The sunny weather mocked Jemima , and the unusual warmth oppressed her physical powers . She felt very weak and languid ; she was acutely sensible that no one else noticed her want of strength ; father , mother , all seemed too full of other things to care if , as she believed , her life was waning . She herself felt glad that it was so . But her delicacy was not unnoticed by all . Her mother often anxiously asked her husband if he did not think Jemima was looking ill ; nor did his affirmation to the contrary satisfy her , as most of his affirmations did . She thought every morning , before she got up , how she could tempt Jemima to eat , by ordering some favourite dainty for dinner ; in many other little ways she tried to minister to her child ; but the poor girl 's own abrupt irritability of temper had made her mother afraid of openly speaking to her about her health . Ruth , too , saw that Jemima was not looking well . How she had become an object of dislike to her former friend she did not know ; but she was sensible that Miss Bradshaw disliked her now . She was not aware that this feeling was growing and strengthening almost into repugnance , for she seldom saw Jemima out of school - hours , and then only for a minute or two . But the evil element of a fellow - creature 's dislike oppressed the atmosphere of her life . That fellow - creature was one who had once loved her so fondly , and whom she still loved , although she had learnt to fear her , as we fear those whose faces cloud over when we come in sight -- who cast unloving glances at us , of which we , though not seeing , are conscious , as of some occult influence ; and the cause of whose dislike is unknown to us , though every word and action seems to increase it . I believe that this sort of dislike is only shown by the jealous , and that it renders the disliker even more miserable , because more continually conscious than the object ; but the growing evidence of Jemima 's feeling made Ruth very unhappy at times . This very May , too , an idea had come into her mind , which she had tried to repress -- namely , that Mr Farquhar was in love with her . It annoyed her extremely ; it made her reproach herself that she ever should think such a thing possible . She tried to strangle the notion , to drown it , to starve it out by neglect -- its existence caused her such pain and distress . The worst was , he had won Leonard 's heart , who was constantly seeking him out ; or , when absent , talking about him . The best was some journey connected with business , which would take him to the Continent for several weeks ; and , during that time , surely this disagreeable fancy of his would die away , if untrue ; and if true , some way would be opened by which she might put a stop to all increase of predilection on his part , and yet retain him as a friend for Leonard -- that darling for whom she was far - seeing and covetous , and miserly of every scrap of love and kindly regard . Mr Farquhar would not have been flattered if he had known how much his departure contributed to Ruth 's rest of mind on the Saturday afternoon on which he set out on his journey . It was a beautiful day ; the sky of that intense quivering blue which seemed as though you could look through it for ever , yet not reach the black , infinite space which is suggested as lying beyond . Now and then a thin , torn , vaporous cloud floated slowly within the vaulted depth ; but the soft air that gently wafted it was not perceptible among the leaves on the trees , which did not even tremble . Ruth sat at her work in the shadow formed by the old grey garden wall ; Miss Benson and Sally -- the one in the parlour window - seat mending stockings , the other hard at work in her kitchen -- were both within talking distance , for it was weather for open doors and windows ; but none of the three kept up any continued conversation ; and in the intervals Ruth sang low a brooding song , such as she remembered her mother singing long ago . Now and then she stopped to look at Leonard , who was labouring away with vehement energy at digging over a small plot of ground , where he meant to prick out some celery plants that had been given to him . Ruth 's heart warmed at the earnest , spirited way in which he thrust his large spade deep down into the brown soil , his ruddy face glowing , his curly hair wet with the exertion ; and yet she sighed to think that the days were over when her deeds of skill could give him pleasure . Now , his delight was in acting himself ; last year , not fourteen months ago , he had watched her making a daisy - chain for him , as if he could not admire her cleverness enough ; this year -- this week , when she had been devoting every spare hour to the simple tailoring which she performed for her boy ( she had always made every article he wore , and felt almost jealous of the employment ) , he had come to her with a wistful look , and asked when he might begin to have clothes made by a man ? Ever since the Wednesday when she had accompanied Mary and Elizabeth , at Mrs Bradshaw 's desire , to be measured for spring clothes by the new Eccleston dressmaker , she had been looking forward to this Saturday afternoon 's pleasure of making summer trousers for Leonard ; but the satisfaction of the employment was a little taken away by Leonard 's speech . It was a sign , however , that her life was very quiet and peaceful , that she had leisure to think upon the thing at all ; and often she forgot it entirely in her low , chanting song , or in listening to the thrush warbling out his afternoon ditty to his patient mate in the holly - bush below . The distant rumble of carts through the busy streets ( it was market - day ) not only formed a low rolling bass to the nearer and pleasanter sounds , but enhanced the sense of peace by the suggestion of the contrast afforded to the repose of the garden by the bustle not far off . But besides physical din and bustle , there is mental strife and turmoil . That afternoon , as Jemima was restlessly wandering about the house , her mother desired her to go on an errand to Mrs Pearson 's , the new dressmaker , in order to give some directions about her sisters ' new frocks . Jemima went , rather than have the trouble of resisting ; or else she would have preferred staying at home , moving or being outwardly quiet according to her own fitful will . Mrs Bradshaw , who , as I have said , had been aware for some time that something was wrong with her daughter , and was very anxious to set it to rights if she only knew how , had rather planned this errand with a view to dispel Jemima 's melancholy .

When she had completed her errand about the frocks , she asked to look at some bonnets , in order to show her recognition of her mother 's kind thought . Mrs Pearson was a smart , clever - looking woman of five or six and thirty . She had all the variety of small - talk at her finger - ends that was formerly needed by barbers to amuse the people who came to be shaved .

136830	138292	138295	138295	mother	4127	" This time Jemima did not go towards home , but in the direction of the outskirts of the town , on the hilly side . She had some dim recollection of hearing her sisters ask if they might not go and invite Leonard and his mother to tea ; and how could she face Ruth , after the conviction had taken possession of her heart that she , and the sinful creature she had just heard of , were one and the same ? It was yet only the middle of the afternoon ; the hours were early in the old - fashioned town of Eccleston . Soft white clouds had come slowly sailing up out of the west ; the plain was flecked with thin floating shadows , gently borne along by the westerly wind that was waving the long grass in the hay - fields into alternate light and shade . Jemima went into one of these fields , lying by the side of the upland road . She was stunned by the shock she had received . The diver , leaving the green sward , smooth and known , where his friends stand with their familiar smiling faces , admiring his glad bravery -- the diver , down in an instant in the horrid depths of the sea , close to some strange , ghastly , lidless - eyed monster , can hardly more feel his blood curdle at the near terror than did Jemima now . Two hours ago -- but a point of time on her mind 's dial -- she had never imagined that she should ever come in contact with any one who had committed open sin ; she had never shaped her conviction into words and sentences , but still it was _ there _ , that all the respectable , all the family and religious circumstances of her life , would hedge her in , and guard her from ever encountering the great shock of coming face to face with vice . Without being pharisaical in her estimation of herself , she had all a Pharisee 's dread of publicans and sinners , and all a child 's cowardliness -- that cowardliness which prompts it to shut its eyes against the object of terror , rather than acknowledge its existence with brave faith . Her father 's often reiterated speeches had not been without their effect . He drew a clear line of partition , which separated mankind into two great groups , to one of which , by the grace of God , he and his belonged ; while the other was composed of those whom it was his duty to try and reform , and bring the whole force of his morality to bear upon , with lectures , admonitions , and exhortations -- a duty to be performed , because it was a duty -- but with very little of that Hope and Faith which is the Spirit that maketh alive . Jemima had rebelled against these hard doctrines of her father 's , but their frequent repetition had had its effect , and led her to look upon those who had gone astray with shrinking , shuddering recoil , instead of with a pity so Christ - like as to have both wisdom and tenderness in it . And now she saw among her own familiar associates one , almost her housefellow , who had been stained with that evil most repugnant to her womanly modesty , that would fain have ignored its existence altogether . She loathed the thought of meeting Ruth again . She wished that she could take her up , and put her down at a distance somewhere -- anywhere -- where she might never see or hear of her more ; never be reminded , as she must be whenever she saw her , that such things were in this sunny , bright , lark - singing earth , over which the blue dome of heaven bent softly down as Jemima sat in the hayfield that June afternoon ; her cheeks flushed and red , but her lips pale and compressed , and her eyes full of a heavy , angry sorrow . It was Saturday , and the people in that part of the country left their work an hour earlier on that day . By this , Jemima knew it must be growing time for her to be at home . She had had so much of conflict in her own mind of late , that she had grown to dislike struggle , or speech , or explanation ; and so strove to conform to times and hours much more than she had done in happier days . But oh ! how full of hate her heart was growing against the world ! And oh ! how she sickened at the thought of seeing Ruth ! Who was to be trusted more , if Ruth -- calm , modest , delicate , dignified Ruth -- had a memory blackened by sin ? As she went heavily along , the thought of Mr Farquhar came into her mind . It showed how terrible had been the stun , that he had been forgotten until now . With the thought of him came in her first merciful feeling towards Ruth . This would never have been , had there been the least latent suspicion in Jemima 's jealous mind that Ruth had purposely done aught -- looked a look -- uttered a word -- modulated a tone -- for the sake of attracting . As Jemima recalled all the passages of their intercourse , she slowly confessed to herself how pure and simple had been all Ruth 's ways in relation to Mr Farquhar . It was not merely that there had been no coquetting , but there had been simple unconsciousness on Ruth 's part , for so long a time after Jemima had discovered Mr Farquhar 's inclination for her ; and when at length she had slowly awakened to some perception of the state of his feelings , there had been a modest , shrinking dignity of manner , not startled , or emotional , or even timid , but pure , grave , and quiet ; and this conduct of Ruth 's , Jemima instinctively acknowledged to be of necessity transparent and sincere . Now , and here , there was no hypocrisy ; but some time , somewhere , on the part of somebody , what hypocrisy , what lies must have been acted , if not absolutely spoken , before Ruth could have been received by them all as the sweet , gentle , girlish widow , which she remembered they had all believed Mrs Denbigh to be when first she came among them ! Could Mr and Miss Benson know ? Could they be a party to the deceit ? Not sufficiently acquainted with the world to understand how strong had been the temptation to play the part they did , if they wished to give Ruth a chance , Jemima could not believe them guilty of such deceit as the knowledge of Mrs Denbigh 's previous conduct would imply ; and yet how it darkened the latter into a treacherous hypocrite , with a black secret shut up in her soul for years -- living in apparent confidence , and daily household familiarity with the Bensons for years , yet never telling the remorse that ought to be corroding her heart ! Who was true ? Who was not ? Who was good and pure ? Who was not ? The very foundations of Jemima 's belief in her mind were shaken . Could it be false ? Could there be two Ruth Hiltons ? She went over every morsel of evidence . It could not be . She knew that Mrs Denbigh 's former name had been Hilton . She had heard her speak casually , but charily , of having lived in Fordham . She knew she had been in Wales but a short time before she made her appearance in Eccleston . There was no doubt of the identity . Into the middle of Jemima 's pain and horror at the afternoon 's discovery , there came a sense of the power which the knowledge of this secret gave her over Ruth ; but this was no relief , only an aggravation of the regret with which Jemima looked back on her state of ignorance . It was no wonder that when she arrived at home , she was so oppressed with headache that she had to go to bed directly . "

Her jealousy was gone -- she knew not how or where . She might shun and recoil from Ruth , but she now thought that she could never more be jealous of her . In her pride of innocence , she felt almost ashamed that such a feeling could have had existence . Could Mr Farquhar hesitate between her own self and one who-- No ! she could not name what Ruth had been , even in thought . And yet he might never know , so fair a seeming did her rival wear . Oh ! for one ray of God 's holy light to know what was seeming , and what was truth , in this traitorous hollow earth ! It might be -- she used to think such things possible , before sorrow had embittered her -- that Ruth had worked her way through the deep purgatory of repentance up to something like purity again ; God only knew ! If her present goodness was real -- if , after having striven back thus far on the heights , a fellow - woman was to throw her down into some terrible depth with her unkind , incontinent tongue , that would be too cruel ! And yet , if -- there was such woeful uncertainty and deceit somewhere -- if Ruth-- No ! that Jemima , with noble candour , admitted was impossible . Whatever Ruth had been , she was good , and to be respected as such , now . It did not follow that Jemima was to preserve the secret always ; she doubted her own power to do so , if Mr Farquhar came home again , and were still constant in his admiration of Mrs Denbigh , and if Mrs Denbigh gave him any -- the least encouragement . But this last she thought , from what she knew of Ruth 's character , was impossible . Only , what was impossible after this afternoon 's discovery ? At any rate , she would watch and wait . Come what might , Ruth was in her power . And , strange to say , this last certainty gave Jemima a kind of protecting , almost pitying , feeling for Ruth . Her horror at the wrong was not diminished ; but the more she thought of the struggles that the wrong - doer must have made to extricate herself , the more she felt how cruel it would be to baffle all by revealing what had been . But for her sisters ' sake she had a duty to perform ; she must watch Ruth . For her love 's sake she could not have helped watching ; but she was too much stunned to recognise the force of her love , while duty seemed the only stable thing to cling to . For the present she would neither meddle nor mar in Ruth 's course of life . CHAPTER XXVI Mr Bradshaw 's Virtuous Indignation So it was that Jemima no longer avoided Ruth , nor manifested by word or look the dislike which for a long time she had been scarce concealing . Ruth could not help noticing that Jemima always sought to be in her presence while she was at Mr Bradshaw 's house ; either when daily teaching Mary and Elizabeth , or when she came as an occasional visitor with Mr and Miss Benson , or by herself . Up to this time Jemima had used no gentle skill to conceal the abruptness with which she would leave the room rather than that Ruth and she should be brought into contact -- rather than that it should fall to her lot to entertain Ruth during any part of the evening . It was months since Jemima had left off sitting in the schoolroom , as had been her wo nt during the first few years of Ruth 's governess - ship . Now , each morning Miss Bradshaw seated herself at a little round table in the window , at her work , or at her writing ; but whether she sewed , or wrote , or read , Ruth felt that she was always watching -- watching . At first Ruth had welcomed all these changes in habit and behaviour , as giving her a chance , she thought , by some patient waiting or some opportune show of enduring , constant love , to regain her lost friend 's regard ; but by - and - by the icy chillness , immovable and grey , struck more to her heart than many sudden words of unkindness could have done . They might be attributed to the hot impulses of a hasty temper -- to the vehement anger of an accuser ; but this measured manner was the conscious result of some deep - seated feeling ; this cold sternness befitted the calm implacability of some severe judge . The watching , which Ruth felt was ever upon her , made her unconsciously shiver , as you would if you saw that the passionless eyes of the dead were visibly gazing upon you . Her very being shrivelled and parched up in Jemima 's presence , as if blown upon by a bitter , keen , east wind . Jemima bent every power she possessed upon the one object of ascertaining what Ruth really was . Sometimes the strain was very painful ; the constant tension made her soul weary ; and she moaned aloud , and upbraided circumstance ( she dared not go higher -- to the Maker of circumstance ) for having deprived her of her unsuspicious happy ignorance . Things were in this state when Mr Richard Bradshaw came on his annual home visit . He was to remain another year in London , and then to return and be admitted into the firm . After he had been a week at home , he grew tired of the monotonous regularity of his father 's household , and began to complain of it to Jemima . "

Mr Farquhar came home the day before Richard Bradshaw left for town . He dropped in after tea at the Bradshaws ' ; he was evidently disappointed to see none but the family there , and looked round whenever the door opened . "

She understood , too , why certain packets were put carefully on one side , apart from the rest of the purchases of Swiss toys and jewellery , by which Mr Farquhar proved that none of Mr Bradshaw 's family had been forgotten by him during his absence . Before the end of the evening , she was very conscious that her sore heart had not forgotten how to be jealous . Her brother did not allow a word , a look , or an incident , which might be supposed on Mr Farquhar 's side to refer to Ruth , to pass unnoticed ; he pointed out all to his sister , never dreaming of the torture he was inflicting , only anxious to prove his own extreme penetration . At length Jemima could stand it no longer , and left the room . She went into the schoolroom , where the shutters were not closed , as it only looked into the garden . She opened the window , to let the cool night air blow in on her hot cheeks . The clouds were hurrying over the moon 's face in a tempestuous and unstable manner , making all things seem unreal ; now clear out in its bright light , now trembling and quivering in shadow . The pain at her heart seemed to make Jemima 's brain grow dull ; she laid her head on her arms , which rested on the window - sill , and grew dizzy with the sick weary notion that the earth was wandering lawless and aimless through the heavens , where all seemed one tossed and whirling wrack of clouds . It was a waking nightmare , from the uneasy heaviness of which she was thankful to be roused by Dick 's entrance . "

141364	141572	141355	141355	I	0	" It seemed to Jemima strange -- and yet only a fitting part of this strange , chaotic world -- to find that her brother , who was the last person to whom she could have given her confidence in her own family , and almost the last person of her acquaintance to whom she could look for real help and sympathy , should have been the only one to hit upon the secret of her love . And the idea passed away from his mind as quickly as all ideas not bearing upon his own self - interests did . The night , the sleepless night , was so crowded and haunted by miserable images , that she longed for day ; and when day came , with its stinging realities , she wearied and grew sick for the solitude of night . For the next week , she seemed to see and hear nothing but what confirmed the idea of Mr Farquhar 's decided attachment to Ruth . Even her mother spoke of it as a thing which was impending , and which she wondered how Mr Bradshaw would like ; for his approval or disapproval was the standard by which she measured all things . "

147842	147892	147829	147829	his	149	" Nothing you can say , can upbraid me like my own conscience ; no degradation you can inflict , by word or deed , can come up to the degradation I have suffered for years , at being a party to a deceit , even for a good end-- "
147893	147902	147829	147829	his	149	" For a good end!--Nay ! what next ? "
147949	148107	147937	147937	his	143	" For a good end . The end was not , as perhaps you consider it to have been , to obtain her admission into your family -- nor yet to put her in the way of gaining her livelihood ; my sister and I would willingly have shared what we have with her ; it was our intention to do so at first , if not for any length of time , at least as long as her health might require it . Why I advised ( perhaps I only yielded to advice ) a change of name -- an assumption of a false state of widowhood -- was because I earnestly desired to place her in circumstances in which she might work out her self - redemption ; and you , sir , know how terribly the world goes against all such as have sinned as Ruth did . She was so young , too . "
148108	148240	148242	148243	Mr Bradshaw	149	" You mistake , sir ; my acquaintance has not lain so much among that class of sinners as to give me much experience of the way in which they are treated . But , judging from what I have seen , I should say they meet with full as much leniency as they deserve ; and supposing they do not -- I know there are plenty of sickly sentimentalists just now who reserve all their interest and regard for criminals -- why not pick out one of these to help you in your task of washing the blackamoor white ? Why choose me to be imposed upon -- my household into which to intrude your protégée ? Why were my innocent children to be exposed to corruption ? I say , "
148249	148316	148242	148243	Mr Bradshaw	149	" how dared you come into this house , where you were looked upon as a minister of religion , with a lie in your mouth ? How dared you single me out , of all people , to be gulled and deceived , and pointed at through the town as the person who had taken an abandoned woman into his house to teach his daughters ? "
148317	148327	147937	147937	his	143	" I own my deceit was wrong and faithless . "
148328	148352	148242	148243	Mr Bradshaw	149	" Yes ! you can own it , now it is found out ! There is small merit in that , I think ! "
148353	148390	148242	148243	Mr Bradshaw	149	" Sir ! I claim no merit . I take shame to myself . I did not single you out . You applied to me with your proposal that Ruth should be your children 's governess . "
148391	148394	147937	147937	his	143	" Pah ! "
148395	148430	148242	148243	Mr Bradshaw	149	" And the temptation was too great-- No ! I will not say that -- but the temptation was greater than I could stand -- it seemed to open out a path of usefulness . "
148431	148443	148445	148446	Mr Bradshaw	149	" Now , do n't let me hear you speak so , "
148451	148479	148445	148446	Mr Bradshaw	149	" I ca n't stand it . It is too much to talk in that way when the usefulness was to consist in contaminating my innocent girls . "
148480	148525	148527	148528	Mr Benson	143	" God knows that if I had believed there had been any danger of such contamination -- God knows how I would have died sooner than have allowed her to enter your family . Mr Bradshaw , you believe me , do n't you ? "
148532	148548	148550	148551	Mr Bradshaw	149	" I really must be allowed the privilege of doubting what you say in future , "
148560	148566	148550	148551	Mr Bradshaw	149	" I have deserved this , "
148571	148574	148576	148576	he	143	" But , "
148584	148742	148576	148576	he	143	" I will not speak of myself , but of Ruth . Surely , sir , the end I aimed at ( the means I took to obtain it were wrong ; you can not feel that more than I do ) was a right one ; and you will not -- you can not say , that your children have suffered from associating with her . I had her in my family , under the watchful eyes of three anxious persons for a year or more ; we saw faults -- no human being is without them -- and poor Ruth 's were but slight venial errors ; but we saw no sign of a corrupt mind -- no glimpse of boldness or forwardness -- no token of want of conscientiousness ; she seemed , and was , a young and gentle girl , who had been led astray before she fairly knew what life was . "
148743	148756	148758	148759	Mr Bradshaw	149	" I suppose most depraved women have been innocent in their time , "
148765	148801	148758	148759	Mr Bradshaw	149	" Oh , Mr Bradshaw ! Ruth was not depraved , and you know it . You can not have seen her -- have known her daily , all these years , without acknowledging that ! "
148830	148878	148820	148820	he	143	" I saw her daily -- I did _ not _ know her . If I had known her , I should have known she was fallen and depraved , and consequently not fit to come into my house , nor to associate with my pure children . "
148879	148973	148974	148975	Mr Benson	143	" Now I wish God would give me power to speak out convincingly what I believe to be His truth , that not every woman who has fallen is depraved ; that many -- how many the Great Judgment Day will reveal to those who have shaken off the poor , sore , penitent hearts on earth -- many , many crave and hunger after a chance for virtue -- the help which no man gives to them -- help -- that gentle , tender help which Jesus gave once to Mary Magdalen . "
148984	149068	148974	148975	Mr Benson	143	" Come , come , Mr Benson , let us have no more of this morbid way of talking . The world has decided how such women are to be treated ; and , you may depend upon it , there is so much practical wisdom in the world that its way of acting is right in the long run , and that no one can fly in its face with impunity , unless , indeed , they stoop to deceit and imposition . "
149069	149080	149082	149083	Mr Benson	143	" I take my stand with Christ against the world , "
149094	149113	149082	149083	Mr Benson	143	" What have the world 's ways ended in ? Can we be much worse than we are ? "
149114	149123	148820	148820	he	143	" Speak for yourself , if you please . "
149124	149205	148974	148975	Mr Benson	143	" Is it not time to change some of our ways of thinking and acting ? I declare before God , that if I believe in any one human truth , it is this -- that to every woman who , like Ruth , has sinned , should be given a chance of self - redemption -- and that such a chance should be given in no supercilious or contemptuous manner , but in the spirit of the holy Christ . "
149206	149220	149082	149083	Mr Benson	143	" Such as getting her into a friend 's house under false colours . "
149221	149333	148820	148820	he	143	" I do not argue on Ruth 's case . In that I have acknowledged my error . I do not argue on any case . I state my firm belief , that it is God 's will that we should not dare to trample any of His creatures down to the hopeless dust ; that it is God 's will that the women who have fallen should be numbered among those who have broken hearts to be bound up , not cast aside as lost beyond recall . If this be God 's will , as a thing of God it will stand ; and He will open a way . "
149334	149426	148974	148975	Mr Benson	143	" I should have attached much more importance to all your exhortation on this point if I could have respected your conduct in other matters . As it is , when I see a man who has deluded himself into considering falsehood right , I am disinclined to take his opinion on subjects connected with morality ; and I can no longer regard him as a fitting exponent of the will of God . You perhaps understand what I mean , Mr Benson . I can no longer attend your chapel . "
149775	149778	149780	149780	he	143	" Ruth ! "
149800	149806	149808	149808	he	143	" Where are you going ? "

149999	150012	149989	149989	he	143	" Sit down in that chair . I will come back directly . "
150044	150053	150055	150055	he	143	" How long has Ruth been at home ? "
150057	150088	150032	150032	Sally	148	" Ruth ! She has never been at home sin ' morning . She and Leonard were to be off for the day somewhere or other with them Bradshaw girls . "
150089	150097	150055	150055	he	143	" Then she has had no dinner ? "
150098	150120	150032	150032	Sally	148	" Not here , at any rate . I ca n't answer for what she may have done at other places . "
150121	150129	150032	150032	Sally	148	" And Leonard -- where is he ? "
150130	150167	150168	150168	She	3314	" How should I know ? With his mother , I suppose . Leastways , that was what was fixed on . I 've enough to do of my own , without routing after other folks . "
150186	150189	150190	150190	he	143	" Sally , "
150193	150226	150190	150190	he	143	" I want a cup of tea . Will you make it as soon as you can ; and some dry toast too ? I 'll come for it in ten minutes . "
150244	150306	150234	150234	she	3314	" What ha ' ye been doing to yourself , to look so grim and grey ? Tiring yourself all to tatters , looking after some naught , I 'll be bound ! Well ! well ! I mun make ye your tea , I reckon ; but I did hope as you grew older you 'd ha ' grown wiser ! "
150405	150417	150419	150420	Mr Benson	143	" Poor child ! This was what she meant , then , "

150502	150531	150494	150494	she	81	" Nay , Ruth , you must not go . You must not leave us . We can not do without you . We love you too much . "

150978	151011	150971	150972	Mr Benson	143	" Now , Ruth , we must talk a little together . I want to understand what your plan was . Where is Helmsby ? Why did you fix to go there ? "

151079	151108	151110	151110	she	81	" but still they would , perhaps , give me some employment -- I do n't care what -- for her sake . I could do many things , "
151116	151167	151168	151168	she	81	" I am sure I could weed -- I could in gardens -- if they did not like to have me in their houses . But perhaps some one , for my mother 's sake -- oh ! my dear , dear mother!--do you know where and what I am ? "
151192	151281	151184	151184	he	143	" Ruth ! you must be still and quiet . I can not have this . I want you to listen to me . Your thought of Helmsby would be a good one , if it was right for you to leave Eccleston ; but I do not think it is . I am certain of this , that it would be a great sin in you to separate yourself from Leonard . You have no right to sever the tie by which God has bound you together . "

And if you go away , he may be unhappy or ill ; and you , who above all others have -- and have from God -- remember _ that _ , Ruth!--the power to comfort him , the tender patience to nurse him , have left him to the care of strangers . Yes ; I know ! But we ourselves are as strangers , dearly as we love him , compared to a mother . He may turn to sin , and want the long forbearance , the serene authority of a parent ; and where are you ? No dread of shame , either for yourself , or even for him , can ever make it right for you to shake off your responsibility . "

151478	151611	151613	151613	he	3324	" we have gone on falsely hitherto . It has been my doing , my mistake , my sin . I ought to have known better . Now , let us stand firm on the truth . You have no new fault to repent of . Be brave and faithful . It is to God you answer , not to men . The shame of having your sin known to the world , should be as nothing to the shame you felt at having sinned . We have dreaded men too much , and God too little , in the course we have taken . But now be of good cheer . Perhaps you will have to find your work in the world very low -- not quite working in the fields , "

Can you accept all this treatment meekly , as but the reasonable and just penance God has laid upon you -- feeling no anger against those who slight you , no impatience for the time to come ( and come it surely will -- I speak as having the word of God for what I say ) when He , having purified you , even as by fire , will make a straight path for your feet ? My child , it is Christ the Lord who has told us of this infinite mercy of God . Have you faith enough in it to be brave , and bear on , and do rightly in patience and in tribulation ? "

151914	152084	152086	152086	he	3327	" The world is not everything , Ruth ; nor is the want of men 's good opinion and esteem the highest need which man has . Teach Leonard this . You would not wish his life to be one summer 's day . You dared not make it so , if you had the power . Teach him to bid a noble , Christian welcome to the trials which God sends -- and this is one of them . Teach him not to look on a life of struggle , and perhaps of disappointment and incompleteness , as a sad and mournful end , but as the means permitted to the heroes and warriors in the army of Christ , by which to show their faithful following . Tell him of the hard and thorny path which was trodden once by the bleeding feet of One . Ruth ! think of the Saviour 's life and cruel death , and of His divine faithfulness . Oh , Ruth ! "

153457	153465	153467	153468	Miss Benson	143	" How could she tell him quietly ? "
153473	153514	153467	153468	Miss Benson	143	" Well ! perhaps I used the wrong word -- of course no one was by -- and I do n't suppose even they themselves could now tell how it was told , or in what spirit it was borne . "
153521	153528	153515	153516	Miss Benson	143	" Was Mr Bradshaw very angry ? "
153529	153550	153298	153298	she	164	" Yes , very ; and justly so . I did very wrong in making that false statement at first . "
153551	153561	153563	153564	Miss Faith	164	" No ! I am sure you did not , "
153566	153602	153563	153564	Miss Faith	164	" Ruth has had some years of peace , in which to grow stronger and wiser , so that she can bear her shame now in a way she never could have done at first . "
153603	153618	153515	153516	Miss Benson	143	" All the same it was wrong in me to do what I did . "
153619	153657	153515	153516	Miss Benson	143	" I did it too , as much or more than you . And I do n't think it wrong . I 'm certain it was quite right , and I would do just the same again . "
153658	153672	153563	153564	Miss Faith	164	" Perhaps it has not done you the harm it has done me . "
153673	153698	153515	153516	Miss Benson	143	" Nonsense ! Thurstan . Do n't be morbid . I 'm sure you are as good -- and better than ever you were . "
153699	153835	153515	153516	Miss Benson	143	" No , I am not . I have got what you call morbid just in consequence of the sophistry by which I persuaded myself that wrong could be right . I torment myself . I have lost my clear instincts of conscience . Formerly , if I believed that such or such an action was according to the will of God , I went and did it , or at least I tried to do it , without thinking of consequences . Now , I reason and weigh what will happen if I do so and so -- I grope where formerly I saw . Oh , Faith ! it is such a relief to me to have the truth known , that I am afraid I have not been sufficiently sympathising with Ruth . "
153836	153840	153842	153843	Miss Benson	143	" Poor Ruth ! "
153845	153871	153842	153843	Miss Benson	143	" But at any rate our telling a lie has been the saving of her . There is no fear of her going wrong now . "
153872	153882	153883	153883	They	3351	" God 's omnipotence did not need our sin . "
153891	153902	153883	153883	They	3351	" You have not told me what Mr Bradshaw said . "
153903	153962	153515	153516	Miss Benson	143	" One ca n't remember the exact words that are spoken on either side in moments of such strong excitement . He was very angry , and said some things about me that were very just , and some about Ruth that were very hard . His last words were that he should give up coming to chapel . "
153963	153974	153515	153516	Miss Benson	143	" Oh , Thurstan ! did it come to that ? "
153975	153978	153883	153883	They	3351	" Yes . "
153979	153987	153515	153516	Miss Benson	143	" Does Ruth know all he said ? "
153988	154111	153515	153516	Miss Benson	143	" No ! Why should she ? I do n't know if she knows he has spoken to me at all . Poor creature ! she had enough to craze her almost without that ! She was for going away and leaving us , that we might not share in her disgrace . I was afraid of her being quite delirious . I did so want you , Faith ! However , I did the best I could ; I spoke to her very coldly , and almost sternly , all the while my heart was bleeding for her . I dared not give her sympathy ; I tried to give her strength . But I did so want you , Faith . "
154112	154147	154206	154206	she	164	" And I was so full of enjoyment , I am ashamed to think of it . But the Dawsons are so kind -- and the day was so fine-- Where is Ruth now ? "
154148	154179	153515	153516	Miss Benson	143	" With Leonard . He is her great earthly motive -- I thought that being with him would be best . But he must be in bed and asleep now . "
154180	154188	154190	154191	Miss Faith	164	" I will go up to her , "
154235	154244	154231	154232	Miss Benson	143	" You must go to bed , Ruth ! "
154620	154687	154604	154604	she	217	" Oh , Mr Benson , I am so glad to see you ! I have so wanted to know all about you ! How is poor Ruth ? dear Ruth ! I wonder if she has forgiven me my cruelty to her ? And I may not go to her now , when I should be so glad and thankful to make up for it . "
154688	154708	154774	154774	she	3365	" I never heard you had been cruel to her . I am sure she does not think so . "
154709	154738	154774	154774	she	3365	" She ought ; she must . What is she doing ? Oh ! I have so much to ask , I can never hear enough ; and papa says"--she
154778	154798	154774	154774	she	3365	" Papa says I must not go to your house -- I suppose it 's right to obey him ? "
154799	154819	154774	154774	she	3365	" Certainly , my dear . It is your clear duty . We know how you feel towards us . "
154820	154865	154867	154867	she	3365	" Oh ! but if I could do any good -- if I could be of any use or comfort to any of you -- especially to Ruth , I should come , duty or not . I believe it would be my duty , "
154882	154927	154929	154929	she	3365	" No ! do n't be afraid ; I wo n't come till I know I can do some good . I hear bits about you through Sally every now and then , or I could not have waited so long . Mr Benson , "
154935	154946	154929	154929	she	3365	" I think you did quite right about poor Ruth . "
154947	154956	154929	154929	she	3365	" Not in the falsehood , my dear . "
154957	155039	155041	155041	she	3366	" No ! not perhaps in that . I was not thinking of that . But I have been thinking a great deal about poor Ruth's -- you know I could not help it when everybody was talking about it -- and it made me think of myself , and what I am . With a father and mother , and home and careful friends , I am not likely to be tempted like Ruth ; but oh ! Mr Benson , "
155067	155215	155217	155217	she	3368	" if you knew all I have been thinking and feeling this last year , you would see how I have yielded to every temptation that was able to come to me ; and , seeing how I have no goodness or strength in me , and how I might just have been like Ruth , or rather , worse than she ever was , because I am more headstrong and passionate by nature , I do so thank you and love you for what you did for her ! And will you tell me really and truly now if I can ever do anything for Ruth ? If you 'll promise me that , I wo n't rebel unnecessarily against papa ; but if you do n't , I will , and come and see you all this very afternoon . Remember ! I trust you ! "
155233	155241	155243	155243	she	3368	" He must know something of it , "
155245	155252	155243	155243	she	3368	" Does he feel it much ? "
155253	155257	155259	155260	Mr Benson	143	" Very much , "
155268	155275	155277	155277	she	217	" It is hard upon him , "
155279	155283	155284	155285	Mr Benson	143	" It is , "

155521	155578	155518	155518	she	81	" I have deserved the anger that is fretting in his heart . It is only I who can reinstate myself in his love and respect . I have no fear . When he sees me really striving hard and long to do what is right , he must love me . I am not afraid . "

157659	157689	157718	157718	he	193	" I am sure I am very much obliged to you for thinking of it . But do not trouble yourself to send it ; Leonard can fetch it . "

157726	157734	157718	157718	he	193	" I have not met him lately . "

157765	157788	157753	157753	he	143	" Leonard is not strong , and we find it difficult to induce him to go much out - of - doors . "
157827	157875	157824	157824	he	193	" You will find rather a lengthened account of the exposure of Sir Thomas Campbell 's conduct at Baden . He seems to be a complete blackleg , in spite of his baronetcy . I fancy the papers are glad to get hold of anything just now . "
157876	157883	157885	157886	Mr Benson	143	" Who is Sir Thomas Campbell ? "
157888	157938	157824	157824	he	193	" Oh , I thought you might have heard the report -- a true one , I believe -- of Mr Donne 's engagement to his daughter . He must be glad she jilted him now , I fancy , after this public exposure of her father 's conduct . "
157965	158050	157952	157952	he	193	" Dick Bradshaw is my informant about all these projected marriages in high life -- they are not much in my way ; but since he has come down from London to take his share in the business , I think I have heard more of the news and the scandal of what , I suppose , would be considered high life , than ever I did before ; and Mr Donne 's proceedings seem to be an especial object of interest to him . "
158051	158065	157952	157952	he	193	" And Mr Donne is engaged to a Miss Campbell , is he ? "
158066	158101	158103	158104	Mr Farquhar	193	" Was engaged ; if I understood right , she broke off the engagement to marry some Russian prince or other -- a better match , Dick Bradshaw told me . I assure you , "
158108	158153	158103	158104	Mr Farquhar	193	" I am a very passive recipient of all such intelligence , and might very probably have forgotten all about it , if the _ Times _ of this morning had not been so full of the disgrace of the young lady 's father . "
158154	158165	158167	158168	Mr Benson	143	" Richard Bradshaw has quite left London , has he ? "
158194	158244	158245	158246	Mr Farquhar	193	" Yes . He has come to settle down here . I hope he may do well , and not disappoint his father , who has formed very high expectations from him ; I am not sure if they are not too high for any young man to realise . "
158268	158294	158296	158297	Mr Benson	143	" I am sure , I trust such a mortification -- such a grief as any disappointment in Richard , may not befall his father , "

158405	158444	158400	158401	Mr Farquhar	193	" Send him to my house for the papers . It will be a little necessity for him to have some regular exercise , and to face the world . He must do it , sooner or later . "

Nothing that you can hear of , you say ; and , of course , one must not ask the downright question . And yet I am sure they must be pinched in some way . Do you think Leonard is stronger ? "
158764	158817	158851	158851	her	3440	" I am not sure . He is growing fast ; and such a blow as he has had will be certain to make him more thoughtful and full of care than most boys of his age ; both these circumstances may make him thin and pale , which he certainly is . "

163539	163550	163469	163469	Jemima	217	" Oh , Ruth , how I hated you once ! "
163551	163583	163496	163496	Jemima	217	" It was all the more noble in you to stand by me as you did . You must have hated me when you knew how I was deceiving you all ! "
163584	163611	163612	163612	They	3539	" No , that was not it that made me hate you . It was before that . Oh , Ruth , I did hate you ! "
163630	163642	163626	163626	Ruth	81	" And you are going to be married to - morrow ! "
163643	163646	163648	163648	Jemima	217	" Yes , "
163650	163682	163648	163648	Jemima	217	" To - morrow , at nine o'clock . But I do n't think I could have been married without coming to wish Mr Benson and Miss Faith good - bye . "
163683	163690	163692	163692	Ruth	81	" I will go for them , "
163694	163735	163737	163737	she	81	" No , not just yet . I want to ask you one or two questions first . Nothing very particular ; only it seems as if there had been such a strange , long separation between us . Ruth , "
163743	163767	163769	163769	she	81	" is Leonard stronger than he was ? I was so sorry to hear about him from Walter . But he is better ? "
163773	163790	163792	163793	his mother	655	" Yes , he is better . Not what a boy of his age should be , "
163804	163809	163811	163811	she	81	" Oh , Jemima ! "
163813	163834	163811	163811	she	81	" my sharpest punishment comes through him . To think what he might have been , and what he is ! "
163835	163854	163855	163855	Jemima	217	" But Walter says he is both stronger in health , and not so -- nervous and shy . "
163883	163917	163918	163918	she	217	" He does not show that he feels his disgrace so much . I can not talk about it , Jemima , my heart aches so about him . But he is better , "
163938	163984	163918	163918	she	217	" He is only studying too closely now ; he takes to his lessons evidently as a relief from thought . He is very clever , and I hope and trust , yet I tremble to say it , I believe he is very good . "
163985	164055	163918	163918	she	217	" You must let him come and see us very often when we come back . We shall be two months away . We are going to Germany , partly on Walter 's business . Ruth , I have been talking to papa to - night , very seriously and quietly , and it has made me love him so much more , and understand him so much better . "
164056	164070	164072	164072	Ruth	81	" Does he know of your coming here ? I hope he does , "
164074	164274	164072	164072	Ruth	81	" Yes . Not that he liked my doing it at all . But , somehow , I can always do things against a person 's wishes more easily when I am on good terms with them -- that 's not exactly what I meant ; but now to - night , after papa had been showing me that he really loved me more than I ever thought he had done ( for I always fancied he was so absorbed in Dick , he did not care much for us girls ) , I felt brave enough to say that I intended to come here and bid you all good - bye . He was silent for a minute , and then said I might do it , but I must remember he did not approve of it , and was not to be compromised by my coming ; still I can tell that , at the bottom of his heart , there is some of the old kindly feeling to Mr and Miss Benson , and I do n't despair of its all being made up , though , perhaps , I ought to say that mamma does . "
164275	164288	164290	164290	Ruth	81	" Mr and Miss Benson wo n't hear of my going away , "
164294	164300	164290	164290	Ruth	81	" They are quite right . "
164301	164324	164072	164072	Ruth	81	" But I am earning nothing . I can not get any employment . I am only a burden and an expense . "
164325	164447	164290	164290	Ruth	81	" Are you not also a pleasure ? And Leonard , is he not a dear object of love ? It is easy for me to talk , I know , who am so impatient . Oh , I never deserved to be so happy as I am ! You do n't know how good Walter is . I used to think him so cold and cautious . But now , Ruth , will you tell Mr and Miss Benson that I am here ? There is signing of papers , and I do n't know what to be done at home . And when I come back , I hope to see you often , if you 'll let me . "
164884	164932	164858	164858	Jemima	217	" I have not many minutes to stay , only I felt as if I must see you . And we want Leonard to come to us to see all our German purchases , and hear all our German adventures . May he come to - morrow ? "
164933	164999	164858	164858	Jemima	217	" Yes ; thank you . Oh ! Jemima , I have heard something -- I have got a plan that makes me so happy ! I have not told any one yet . But Mr Wynne ( the parish doctor , you know ) has asked me if I would go out as a sick nurse -- he thinks he could find me employment . "
165000	165007	165009	165009	Jemima	217	" You , a sick nurse ! "
165038	165053	164858	164858	Jemima	217	" My dear Ruth , I do n't think you are fitted for it ! "
165054	165059	165061	165061	Ruth	81	" Do n't you ? "
165067	165140	165061	165061	Ruth	81	" I think I am ; at least , that I should be very soon . I like being about sick and helpless people ; I always feel so sorry for them ; and then I think I have the gift of a very delicate touch , which is such a comfort in many cases . And I should try to be very watchful and patient . Mr Wynne proposed it himself . "
165141	165179	164858	164858	Jemima	217	" It was not in that way I meant you were not fitted for it . I meant that you were fitted for something better . Why , Ruth , you are better educated than I am ! "
165180	165217	164858	164858	Jemima	217	" But if nobody will allow me to teach?--for that is what I suppose you mean . Besides , I feel as if all my education would be needed to make me a good sick nurse . "
165218	165227	165229	165229	Jemima	217	" Your knowledge of Latin , for instance , "
165251	165254	165256	165256	Ruth	81	" Well ! "
165258	165271	165256	165256	Ruth	81	" that wo n't come amiss ; I can read the prescriptions . "
165272	165283	164858	164858	Jemima	217	" Which the doctors would rather you did not do . "
165284	165311	164858	164858	Jemima	217	" Still , you ca n't say that any knowledge of any kind will be in my way , or will unfit me for my work . "
165312	165333	165256	165256	Ruth	81	" Perhaps not . But all your taste and refinement will be in your way , and will unfit you . "
165334	165432	164858	164858	Jemima	217	" You have not thought about this so much as I have , or you would not say so . Any fastidiousness I shall have to get rid of , and I shall be better without ; but any true refinement I am sure I shall find of use ; for do n't you think that every power we have may be made to help us in any right work , whatever that is ? Would you not rather be nursed by a person who spoke gently and moved quietly about than by a loud bustling woman ? "
165433	165485	164858	164858	Jemima	217	" Yes , to be sure ; but a person unfit for anything else may move quietly , and speak gently , and give medicine when the doctor orders it , and keep awake at night ; and those are the best qualities I ever heard of in a sick nurse . "
165499	165550	165496	165496	she	81	" At any rate it is work , and as such I am thankful for it . You can not discourage me -- and perhaps you know too little of what my life has been -- how set apart in idleness I have been -- to sympathise with me fully . "
165551	165584	165496	165496	she	81	" And I wanted you to come to see us -- me in my new home . Walter and I had planned that we would persuade you to come to us very often "
165597	165613	165496	165496	she	81	" and now you will have to be fastened up in a sick - room . "
165614	165621	165623	165623	Ruth	81	" I could not have come , "
165626	165691	165623	165623	Ruth	81	" Dear Jemima ! it is like you to have thought of it -- but I could not come to your house . It is not a thing to reason about . It is just feeling . But I do feel as if I could not go . Dear Jemima ! if you are ill or sorrowful , and want me , I will come-- "
165692	165709	165496	165496	she	81	" So you would and must to any one , if you take up that calling . "
165710	165750	165623	165623	Ruth	81	" But I should come to you , love , in quite a different way ; I should go to you with my heart full of love -- so full that I am afraid I should be too anxious . "
165751	165768	165623	165623	Ruth	81	" I almost wish I were ill , that I might make you come at once . "
165769	165817	165623	165623	Ruth	81	" And I am almost ashamed to think how I should like you to be in some position in which I could show you how well I remember that day -- that terrible day in the school - room . God bless you for it , Jemima ! "
166999	167056	166989	166990	Mr Benson	143	" I do not know . It would be a great advantage in some respects ; and yet I doubt whether it would in others . His mother 's influence over him is thoroughly good , and I should fear that any thoughtless allusions to his peculiar position might touch the raw spot in his mind . "
167057	167091	167342	167343	Mr Farquhar	193	" But he is so unusually clever , it seems a shame not to give him all the advantages he can have . Besides , does he see much of his mother now ? "
167092	167184	166989	166990	Mr Benson	143	" Hardly a day passes without her coming home to be an hour or so with him , even at her busiest times ; she says it is her best refreshment . And often , you know , she is disengaged for a week or two , except the occasional services which she is always rendering to those who need her . Your offer is very tempting , but there is so decidedly another view of the question to be considered , that I believe we must refer it to her . "
167185	167214	166989	166990	Mr Benson	143	" With all my heart . Do n't hurry her to a decision . Let her weigh it well . I think she will find the advantages preponderate . "
167215	167236	167342	167343	Mr Farquhar	193	" I wonder if I might trouble you with a little business , Mr Farquhar , as you are here ? "
167237	167253	166989	166990	Mr Benson	143	" Certainly ; I am only too glad to be of any use to you . "
167254	167341	166989	166990	Mr Benson	143	" Why , I see from the report of the Star Life Assurance Company in the _ Times _ , which you are so good as to send me , that they have declared a bonus on the shares ; now it seems strange that I have received no notification of it , and I thought that perhaps it might be lying at your office , as Mr Bradshaw was the purchaser of the shares , and I have always received the dividends through your firm . "
167356	167368	167370	167370	he	193	" I 've no doubt that 's the way of it , "
167372	167434	167370	167370	he	193	" Some of our clerks have been careless about it ; or it may be Richard himself . He is not always the most punctual and exact of mortals ; but I 'll see about it . Perhaps after all it may n't come for a day or two ; they have always such numbers of these circulars to send out . "
167435	167473	167477	167477	his	193	" Oh ! I 'm in no hurry about it . I only want to receive it some time before I incur any expenses , which the promise of this bonus may tempt me to indulge in . "
167809	167812	167813	167813	he	149	" Really , "
167816	167862	167813	167813	he	149	" these Dissenting ministers have no more notion of exactitude in their affairs than a child ! The idea of forgetting that he has sold his shares , and applying for the bonus , when it seems he has transferred them only a year ago ! "
167874	167882	167884	167884	he	149	" I do n't quite understand it , "
167886	167951	167884	167884	he	149	" Mr Benson was quite clear about it . He could not have received his half - yearly dividends unless he had been possessed of these shares ; and I do n't suppose Dissenting ministers , with all their ignorance of business , are unlike other men in knowing whether or not they receive the money that they believe to be owing to them . "
167952	168033	167813	167813	he	149	" I should not wonder if they were -- if Benson was , at any rate . Why , I never knew his watch to be right in all my life -- it was always too fast or too slow ; it must have been a daily discomfort to him . It ought to have been . Depend upon it , his money matters are just in the same irregular state ; no accounts kept , I 'll be bound . "
168034	168043	168045	168046	Mr Farquhar	193	" I do n't see that that follows , "
168051	168077	168045	168046	Mr Farquhar	193	" That watch of his is a very curious one -- belonged to his father and grandfather , I do n't know how far back . "
168078	168104	168105	168106	Mr Farquhar	193	" And the sentimental feelings which he is guided by prompt him to keep it , to the inconvenience of himself and every one else . "
168117	168191	168105	168106	Mr Farquhar	193	" But about this letter . I wrote , at Mr Benson 's desire , to the Insurance Office , and I am not satisfied with this answer . All the transaction has passed through our hands . I do not think it is likely Mr Benson would write and sell the shares without , at any rate , informing us at the time , even though he forgot all about it afterwards . "
168192	168202	168045	168046	Mr Farquhar	193	" Probably he told Richard , or Mr Watson . "
168203	168235	168236	168237	Mr Bradshaw	149	" We can ask Mr Watson at once . I am afraid we must wait till Richard comes home , for I do n't know where a letter would catch him . "
168257	168297	168253	168253	he	149	" You may depend upon it , Farquhar , the blunder lies with Benson himself . He is just the man to muddle away his money in indiscriminate charity , and then to wonder what has become of it . "
168308	168312	168314	168315	Mr Bradshaw	149	" Mr Watson , "
168325	168404	168314	168315	Mr Bradshaw	149	" here is some mistake about those Insurance shares we purchased for Benson ten or a dozen years ago . He spoke to Mr Farquhar about some bonus they are paying to the shareholders , it seems ; and , in reply to Mr Farquhar 's letter , the Insurance Company say the shares were sold twelve months since . Have you any knowledge of the transaction ? Has the transfer passed through your hands ? By the way "
168412	168423	168314	168315	Mr Bradshaw	149	" who kept the certificates ? Did Benson or we ? "
168424	168431	168433	168434	Mr Farquhar	193	" I really do n't know , "
168436	168444	168433	168434	Mr Farquhar	193	" Perhaps Mr Watson can tell us . "
168477	168485	168486	168486	he	267	" It seems very strange , sir , "
168498	168531	168486	168486	he	267	" for I paid Mr Benson the account of the dividends myself last June , and got a receipt in form , and that is since the date of the alleged transfer . "
168532	168542	168544	168545	Mr Farquhar	193	" Pretty nearly twelve months after it took place , "
168547	168568	168570	168571	Mr Bradshaw	149	" How did you receive the dividends ? An order on the Bank , along with old Mrs Cranmer 's ? "
168575	168599	168570	168571	Mr Bradshaw	149	" I do n't know how they came . Mr Richard gave me the money , and desired me to get the receipt . "
168600	168609	168611	168612	Mr Bradshaw	149	" It 's unlucky Richard is from home , "
168614	168625	168611	168612	Mr Bradshaw	149	" He could have cleared up this mystery for us . "
168631	168644	168646	168646	he	193	" Do you know where the certificates were kept , Mr Watson ? "
168648	168673	168646	168646	he	193	" I 'll not be sure , but I think they were with Mrs Cranmer 's papers and deeds in box A , 24 . "
168674	168702	168570	168571	Mr Bradshaw	149	" I wish old Cranmer would have made any other man his executor . She , too , is always coming with some unreasonable request or other . "
168703	168719	168720	168721	Mr Watson	267	" Mr Benson 's inquiry about his bonus is perfectly reasonable , at any rate . "
168742	168804	168806	168806	he	267	" I 'll not be sure , but I am almost certain , Mr Benson said , when I paid him last June , that he thought he ought to give the receipt on a stamp , and had spoken about it to Mr Richard the time before , but that Mr Richard said it was of no consequence . Yes , "
168817	168847	168806	168806	he	267	" he did -- I remember now -- and I thought to myself that Mr Richard was but a young man . Mr Richard will know all about it . "
168848	168851	168853	168854	Mr Farquhar	193	" Yes , "
168858	168868	168870	168871	Mr Bradshaw	149	" I sha n't wait till Richard 's return , "
168873	168950	168870	168871	Mr Bradshaw	149	" We can soon see if the certificates are in the box Watson points out ; if they are there , the Insurance people are no more fit to manage their concern than that cat , and I shall tell them so . If they are not there ( as I suspect will prove to be the case ) , it is just forgetfulness on Benson 's part , as I have said from the first . "
168951	168960	168962	168963	Mr Farquhar	193	" You forget the payment of the dividends , "
168970	168978	168980	168981	Mr Bradshaw	149	" Well , sir ! what then ? "
169027	169036	169038	169038	Watson	267	" I suppose I may go , sir , "
169059	169072	169074	169075	Mr Bradshaw	149	" Yes . Go . What do you mean about the dividends ? "
169082	169103	169105	169106	Mr Farquhar	193	" Simply , that I think there can have been no forgetfulness -- no mistake on Mr Benson 's part , "
169117	169153	169105	169106	Mr Farquhar	193	" Then of course it is some blunder of that confounded Insurance Company . I will write to them to - day , and make them a little brisker and more correct in their statements . "
169154	169178	169186	169187	Mr Bradshaw	149	" Do n't you think it would be better to wait till Richard 's return ? He may be able to explain it . "
169179	169184	169186	169187	Mr Bradshaw	149	" No , sir ! "
169191	169255	169186	169187	Mr Bradshaw	149	" I do not think it would be better . It has not been my way of doing business to spare any one , or any company , the consequences of their own carelessness ; nor to obtain information second - hand when I could have it direct from the source . I shall write to the Insurance Office by the next post . "
169427	169437	169404	169404	he	3631	" On the part of the Star Insurance Company , "
169469	169496	169462	169462	he	149	" Desire the gentleman to walk up . Stay ! I will ring my bell in a minute or two , and then show him upstairs . "
169591	169662	169663	169663	He	149	" After all , I am a fool for once in my life . If the certificates are in no box which I have yet examined , that does not imply they may not be in some one which I have not had time to search . Farquhar would stay so late last night ! And even if they are in none of the boxes here , that does not prove-- "
169786	169792	169794	169795	Mr Bradshaw	149	" Sit down , sir ! "
169797	169843	169794	169795	Mr Bradshaw	149	" You are aware , sir , I presume , that I come on the part of Mr Dennison , the manager of the Star Insurance Company , to reply in person to a letter of yours , of the 29th , addressed to him ? "
169848	169856	169857	169857	he	149	" A very careless piece of business , "
169862	169891	169857	169857	he	149	" Mr Dennison does not think you will consider it as such when you have seen the deed of transfer , which I am commissioned to show you . "
169969	170003	169965	169966	Mr Bradshaw	149	" It is possible that it may be -- of course , you will allow me to take this paper to Mr Benson , to -- to inquire if this be his signature ? "
170004	170018	170020	170021	the clerk	3641	" There can be no doubt of it , I think , sir , "
170035	170048	170027	170027	he	3641	" I do n't know , sir -- I do n't know . "
170079	170097	170099	170099	he	149	" You have heard , sir , of such a thing as forgery -- forgery , sir ? "
170126	170166	170115	170115	he	149	" Oh , sir ! there is no room for imagining such a thing , I assure you . In our affairs we become aware of curious forgetfulness on the part of those who are not of business habits . "
170167	170208	170210	170210	he	149	" Still I should like to show it Mr Benson , to prove to him his forgetfulness , you know . I believe , on my soul , it is some of his careless forgetfulness -- I do , sir , "
170218	170247	170213	170213	he	149	" It must have been . Allow me to convince myself . You shall have it back to - night , or the first thing in the morning . "
170347	170387	170339	170339	He	149	" You are afraid , I see . I assure you , you may trust me . If there has been any fraud -- if I have the slightest suspicion of the truth of the surmise I threw out just now,"--he

170456	170482	170450	170450	he	149	" I do n't believe it -- I do n't believe it . I 'm convinced it 's a blunder of that old fool Benson . "
170981	170994	170978	170978	He	143	" That is right . It was you I wanted to see . "
171055	171059	171061	171061	he	149	" Read it ! "
171081	171087	171078	171078	he	149	" That is your signature ? "
171102	171109	171111	171112	Mr Benson	143	" No , it is not , "
171116	171139	171111	171112	Mr Benson	143	" It is very like my writing . I could almost say it was mine , but I know it is not . "
171140	171166	171078	171078	he	149	" Recollect yourself a little . The date is August the third of last year , fourteen months ago . You may have forgotten it . "
171198	171229	171194	171194	his	143	" It is most singularly like mine ; but I could not have signed away these shares -- all the property I have -- without the slightest remembrance of it . "
171230	171280	171281	171281	He	149	" Stranger things have happened . For the love of Heaven , think if you did not sign it . It 's a deed of transfer for those Insurance shares , you see . You do n't remember it ? You did not write this name -- these words ? "
171352	171443	171344	171344	he	149	" Do n't imagine , sir , I wish to force any invention upon you as a remembrance . If you did not write this name , I know who did . Once more I ask you,--does no glimmering recollection of -- having needed money , we 'll say -- I never wanted you to refuse my subscription to the chapel , God knows!--of having sold these accursed shares?--Oh ! I see by your face you did not write it ; you need not speak to me -- I know . "
171488	171498	171473	171474	Mr Benson	143	" You say you did not write these words ? "
171509	171520	171473	171474	Mr Benson	143	" I believe you ; Richard Bradshaw did write them . "
171521	171531	171533	171534	Mr Benson	143	" My dear sir -- my dear old friend ! "
171536	171563	171533	171534	Mr Benson	143	" you are rushing to a conclusion for which , I am convinced , there is no foundation ; there is no reason to suppose that because-- "
171564	171581	171582	171582	His	149	" There is reason , sir . Do not distress yourself -- I am perfectly calm . "
171593	171658	171473	171474	Mr Benson	143	" What we have now to do is to punish the offence . I have not one standard for myself and those I love--(and , Mr Benson , I did love him)--and another for the rest of the world . If a stranger had forged my name , I should have known it was my duty to prosecute him . You must prosecute Richard . "
171659	171664	171666	171667	Mr Benson	143	" I will not , "
171669	171735	171666	171667	Mr Benson	143	" You think , perhaps , that I shall feel it acutely . You are mistaken . He is no longer as my son to me . I have always resolved to disown any child of mine who was guilty of sin . I disown Richard . He is as a stranger to me . I shall feel no more at his exposure -- his punishment-- "
171748	171874	171666	171667	Mr Benson	143	" Of course , you understand that I must feel shame at our connexion ; it is that that is troubling me ; that is but consistent with a man who has always prided himself on the integrity of his name ; but as for that boy , who has been brought up all his life as I have brought up my children , it must be some innate wickedness ! Sir , I can cut him off , though he has been as my right hand -- beloved . Let me be no hindrance to the course of justice , I beg . He has forged your name -- he has defrauded you of money -- of your all , I think you said . "
171875	171904	171666	171667	Mr Benson	143	" Someone has forged my name . I am not convinced that it was your son . Until I know all the circumstances , I decline to prosecute . "
171905	171909	171911	171912	Mr Bradshaw	149	" What circumstances ? "
171931	171944	171926	171926	his	149	" The force of the temptation -- the previous habits of the person-- "
171945	171954	171955	171956	Mr Bradshaw	149	" Of Richard . He is the person , "
171970	172016	171960	171961	Mr Benson	143	" I should think it right to prosecute , if I found out that this offence against me was only one of a series committed , with premeditation , against society . I should then feel , as a protector of others more helpless than myself-- "
172017	172023	172025	172026	Mr Bradshaw	149	" It was your all , "
172028	172041	172043	172044	Mr Benson	143	" It was all my money ; it was not my all , "
172059	172131	172048	172048	he	143	" Against an habitual offender . I shall not prosecute Richard . Not because he is your son -- do not imagine that ! I should decline taking such a step against any young man without first ascertaining the particulars about him , which I know already about Richard , and which determine me against doing what would blast his character for life -- would destroy every good quality he has . "
172132	172140	172142	172143	Mr Bradshaw	149	" What good quality remains to him ? "
172145	172156	172048	172048	he	143	" He has deceived me -- he has offended God . "
172157	172165	172166	172167	Mr Benson	143	" Have we not all offended Him ? "
172175	172190	172166	172167	Mr Benson	143	" Not consciously . I never do wrong consciously . But Richard -- Richard . "
172235	172274	172231	172231	he	143	" It is no use talking , sir . You and I can not agree on these subjects . Once more , I desire you to prosecute that boy , who is no longer a child of mine . "
172275	172319	172231	172231	he	143	" Mr Bradshaw , I shall not prosecute him . I have said it once for all . To - morrow you will be glad that I do not listen to you . I should only do harm by saying more at present . "
172470	172504	172463	172463	he	149	" If there were more people like me , and fewer like you , there would be less evil in the world , sir . It 's your sentimentalists that nurse up sin . "

172779	172805	172768	172769	Mr Benson	143	" Here 's a woman down below as must see you directly . She 'll be upstairs after me if you 're not down quick . "

172834	172849	172828	172828	she	148	" I reckon it 's Mrs Bradshaw , for all she 's muffled up . "

172917	173002	172905	172905	she	148	" you wo n't be so cruel , will you ? I have got some money somewhere -- some money my father settled on me , sir ; I do n't know how much , but I think it 's more than two thousand pounds , and you shall have it all . If I ca n't give it you now , I 'll make a will , sir . Only be merciful to poor Dick -- don't go and prosecute him , sir . "
173003	173024	172882	172883	Mr Benson	143	" My dear Mrs Bradshaw , do n't agitate yourself in this way . I never meant to prosecute him . "
173025	173034	172905	172905	she	148	" But Mr Bradshaw says that you must . "
173035	173049	172905	172905	she	148	" I shall not , indeed . I have told Mr Bradshaw so . "
173050	173165	172882	172883	Mr Benson	143	" Has he been here ? Oh ! is not he cruel ? I do n't care . I 've been a good wife till now . I know I have . I have done all he bid me , ever since we were married . But now I will speak my mind , and say to everybody how cruel he is -- how hard to his own flesh and blood ! If he puts poor Dick in prison , I will go too . If I 'm to choose between my husband and my son , I choose my son ; for he will have no friends , unless I am with him . "
173166	173197	172905	172905	she	148	" Mr Bradshaw will think better of it . You will see that , when his first anger and disappointment are over , he will not be hard or cruel . "
173198	173206	173208	173208	she	3685	" You do n't know Mr Bradshaw , "
173212	173268	173208	173208	she	3685	" if you think he 'll change . I might beg and beg -- I have done many a time , when we had little children , and I wanted to save them a whipping -- but no begging ever did any good . At last I left it off . He 'll not change . "
173269	173285	173289	173289	his	3686	" Perhaps not for human entreaty . Mrs Bradshaw , is there nothing more powerful ? "
173298	173309	173311	173311	she	3685	" If you mean that God may soften his heart , "
173315	173334	173335	173335	she	3685	" I 'm not going to deny God 's power -- I have need to think of Him , "
173343	173379	173335	173335	she	3685	" for I am a very miserable woman . Only think ! he cast it up against me last night , and said , if I had not spoilt Dick this never would have happened . "
173380	173427	173431	173431	he	3687	" He hardly knew what he was saying last night . I will go to Mr Farquhar 's directly , and see him ; and you had better go home , my dear Mrs Bradshaw ; you may rely upon our doing all that we can . "
173567	173573	173575	173576	Mr Benson	143	" What can we do ? "
173585	173651	173579	173580	Mr Farquhar	193	" That is just what I was asking myself . I think I must see Mr Bradshaw , and try and bring him a little out of this unmerciful frame of mind . That must be the first thing . Will you object to accompany me at once ? It seems of particular consequence that we should subdue his obduracy before the affair gets wind . "
173652	173766	173767	173768	Mr Benson	143	" I will go with you willingly . But I believe I rather serve to irritate Mr Bradshaw ; he is reminded of things he has said to me formerly , and which he thinks he is bound to act up to . However , I can walk with you to the door , and wait for you ( if you 'll allow me ) in the street . I want to know how he is to - day , both bodily and mentally ; for indeed , Mr Farquhar , I should not have been surprised last night if he had dropped down dead , so terrible was his strain upon himself . "
173785	173796	173798	173799	the girls	414	" Oh , Mr Farquhar , what is the matter ? "
173805	173876	173798	173799	the girls	414	" Mamma sits crying in the old nursery . We believe she has been there all night . She will not tell us what it is , nor let us be with her ; and papa is locked up in his room , and wo n't even answer us when we speak , though we know he is up and awake , for we heard him tramping about all night . "
173877	173885	173887	173888	Mr Farquhar	193	" Let me go up to him , "
173890	173905	173887	173888	Mr Farquhar	193	" He wo n't let you in . It will be of no use . "
174054	174080	174045	174045	He	193	" Come home and breakfast with me . I am off to London in an hour or two , and must speak with you first . "
174109	174118	174120	174120	he	193	" Now I can tell you about it , "
174122	174175	174120	174120	he	193	" I see my way clearly to a certain point . We must prevent Dick and his father meeting just now , or all hope of Dick 's reformation is gone for ever . His father is as hard as the nether mill - stone . He has forbidden me his house . "
174176	174180	174045	174045	He	193	" Forbidden you ! "
174181	174427	174120	174120	he	193	" Yes ; because I would not give up Dick as utterly lost and bad ; and because I said I should return to London with the clerk , and fairly tell Dennison ( he 's a Scotchman , and a man of sense and feeling ) the real state of the case . By the way , we must not say a word to the clerk ; otherwise he will expect an answer , and make out all sorts of inferences for himself , from the unsatisfactory reply he must have . Dennison will be upon honour -- will see every side of the case -- will know you refuse to prosecute ; the Company of which he is manager are no losers . Well ! when I said what I thought wise , of all this -- when I spoke as if my course were a settled and decided thing , the grim old man asked me if he was to be an automaton in his own house . He assured me he had no feeling for Dick -- all the time he was shaking like an aspen ; in short , repeated much the same things he must have said to you last night . However , I defied him ; and the consequence is , I 'm forbidden the house , and , what is more , he says he will not come to the office while I remain a partner . "
174428	174434	174120	174120	he	193	" What shall you do ? "
174435	174545	174045	174045	He	193	" Send Jemima and the baby . There 's nothing like a young child for bringing people round to a healthy state of feeling ; and you do n't know what Jemima is , Mr Benson ! No ! though you 've known her from her birth . If she ca n't comfort her mother , and if the baby ca n't steal into her grandfather 's heart , why -- I do n't know what you may do to me . I shall tell Jemima all , and trust to her wit and wisdom to work at this end , while I do my best at the other . "
174546	174555	174120	174120	he	193	" Richard is abroad , is not he ? "
174556	174644	174120	174120	he	193	" He will be in England to - morrow . I must catch him somewhere ; but that I can easily do . The difficult point will be , what to do with him -- what to say to him , when I find him . He must give up his partnership , that 's clear . I did not tell his father so , but I am resolved upon it . There shall be no tampering with the honour of the firm to which I belong . "
174645	174653	174655	174656	Mr Benson	143	" But what will become of him ? "
174660	174756	174758	174758	he	3704	" I do not yet know . But , for Jemima 's sake -- for his dear old father 's sake -- I will not leave him adrift . I will find him some occupation as clear from temptation as I can . I will do all in my power . And he will do much better , if he has any good in him , as a freer agent , not cowed by his father into a want of individuality and self - respect . I believe I must dismiss you , Mr Benson , "
174765	174793	174758	174758	he	3704	" I have to explain all to my wife , and to go to that clerk . You shall hear from me in a day or two . "
175117	175123	175125	175125	she	217	" Oh , Mr Benson ! "
175127	175301	175125	175125	she	217	" will you come with me , and tell papa this sad news about Dick ? Walter has written me a letter at last to say he has found him -- he could not at first ; but now it seems that , the day before yesterday , he heard of an accident which had happened to the Dover coach ; it was overturned -- two passengers killed , and several badly hurt . Walter says we ought to be thankful , as he is , that Dick was not killed . He says it was such a relief to him on going to the place -- the little inn nearest to where the coach was overturned -- to find that Dick was only severely injured ; not one of those who was killed . But it is a terrible shock to us all . We had had no more dreadful fear to lessen the shock ; mamma is quite unfit for anything , and we none of us dare to tell papa . "
175320	175334	175336	175337	Mr Benson	143	" How is your father ? I have wanted to hear every day , "
175341	175431	175336	175337	Mr Benson	143	" It was careless of me not to come and tell you ; but , indeed , I have had so much to do . Mamma would not go near him . He has said something which she seems as if she could not forgive . Because he came to meals , she would not . She has almost lived in the nursery ; taking out all Dick 's old playthings , and what clothes of his were left , and turning them over , and crying over them . "
175432	175461	175316	175316	they	3716	" Then Mr Bradshaw has joined you again ; I was afraid , from what Mr Farquhar said , he was going to isolate himself from you all ? "
175462	175468	175470	175470	Jemima	217	" I wish he had , "
175475	175552	175470	175470	Jemima	217	" It would have been more natural than the way he has gone on ; the only difference from his usual habits is , that he has never gone near the office , or else he has come to meals just as usual , and talked just as usual ; and even done what I never knew him do before , tried to make jokes -- all in order to show us how little he cares . "
175553	175562	175649	175649	she	3718	" Does he not go out at all ? "
175563	175619	175470	175470	Jemima	217	" Only in the garden . I am sure he does care after all ; he must care ; he can not shake off a child in this way , though he thinks he can ; and that makes me so afraid of telling him of this accident . Will you come , Mr Benson ? "
175678	175685	175667	175667	she	3718	saying--"Papa , here is Mr Benson , "
175763	175770	175772	175773	Mr Benson	143	" Mrs Farquhar has asked me , "
175784	175798	175799	175799	he	143	" to tell you about a letter she has received from her husband ; "
175830	175913	175809	175809	he	143	" She need not have given you that trouble . I am aware of the reason of Mr Farquhar 's absence . I entirely disapprove of his conduct . He is regardless of my wishes ; and disobedient to the commands which , as my son - in - law , I thought he would have felt bound to respect . If there is any more agreeable subject that you can introduce , I shall be glad to hear you , sir . "
175914	175941	175956	175956	he	3726	" Neither you , nor I , must think of what we like to hear or to say . You must hear what concerns your son . "
175942	175954	175956	175956	he	3726	" I have disowned the young man who was my son , "
175960	175968	175970	175971	Mr Benson	143	" The Dover coach has been overturned , "
176044	176063	176064	176064	he	149	" Oh ! I have been too sudden , sir -- he is alive , he is alive ! "
176127	176132	176134	176134	he	143	" Oh , Jemima ! "
176136	176162	176134	176134	he	143	" I have done it so badly -- I have been so cruel -- he is very ill , I fear -- bring water , brandy-- "
176196	176210	176212	176212	Jemima	217	" Fetch my mother , Mary . Send for the doctor , Elizabeth , "
176597	176608	176580	176580	he	143	" He is alive , sir ; is he not ? "
176609	176636	176638	176639	Mr Benson	143	" Yes , sir -- indeed he is ; he is only hurt . He is sure to do well . Mr Farquhar is with him , "
176742	176745	176728	176728	he	149	said--"Thank God ! "
177416	177421	177423	177424	Mr Benson	143	" Rely upon it , "
177426	177444	177423	177424	Mr Benson	143	" he has not only attended to it , but treasured up every expression you have used . "
177445	177522	177399	177399	he	193	" Well , I tried to get some opinion , or sign of emotion , out of him . I had not much hope of the latter , I must own ; but I thought he would have said whether I had done wisely or not in procuring that Glasgow situation for Dick -- that he would , perhaps , have been indignant at my ousting him from the partnership so entirely on my own responsibility . "
177523	177530	177423	177424	Mr Benson	143	" How did Richard take it ? "
177531	177782	177423	177424	Mr Benson	143	" Oh , nothing could exceed his penitence . If one had never heard of the proverb , ' When the devil was sick , the devil a monk would be , ' I should have had greater faith in him ; or if he had had more strength of character to begin with , or more reality and less outward appearance of good principle instilled into him . However , this Glasgow situation is the very thing ; clear , defined duties , no great trust reposed in him , a kind and watchful head , and introductions to a better class of associates than I fancy he has ever been thrown amongst before . For , you know , Mr Bradshaw dreaded all intimacies for his son , and wanted him to eschew all society beyond his own family -- would never allow him to ask a friend home . Really , when I think of the unnatural life Mr Bradshaw expected him to lead , I get into charity with him , and have hopes . By the way , have you ever succeeded in persuading his mother to send Leonard to school ? He may run the same risk from isolation as Dick : not be able to choose his companions wisely when he grows up , but be too much overcome by the excitement of society to be very discreet as to who are his associates . Have you spoken to her about my plan ? "
177783	177830	177399	177399	he	193	" Yes ! but to no purpose . I can not say that she would even admit an argument on the subject . She seemed to have an invincible repugnance to the idea of exposing him to the remarks of other boys on his peculiar position . "
177831	177860	177423	177424	Mr Benson	143	" They need never know of it . Besides , sooner or later , he must step out of his narrow circle , and encounter remark and scorn . "
177861	177864	177866	177867	Mr Benson	143	" True , "
177871	177930	177866	177867	Mr Benson	143	" And you may depend upon it , if it really is the best for Leonard , she will come round to it by - and - by . It is almost extraordinary to see the way in which her earnest and most unselfish devotion to this boy 's real welfare leads her to right and wise conclusions . "
177931	178049	177423	177424	Mr Benson	143	" I wish I could tame her so as to let me meet her as a friend . Since the baby was born , she comes to see Jemima . My wife tells me , that she sits and holds it soft in her arms , and talks to it as if her whole soul went out to the little infant . But if she hears a strange footstep on the stair , what Jemima calls the ' wild - animal look ' comes back into her eyes , and she steals away like some frightened creature . With all that she has done to redeem her character , she should not be so timid of observation . "
178050	178305	177866	177867	Mr Benson	143	" You may well say ' with all that she has done ! ' We of her own household hear little or nothing of what she does . If she wants help , she simply tells us how and why ; but if not -- perhaps because it is some relief to her to forget for a time the scenes of suffering in which she has been acting the part of comforter , and perhaps because there always was a shy , sweet reticence about her -- we never should know what she is and what she does , except from the poor people themselves , who would bless her in words if the very thought of her did not choke them with tears . Yet , I do assure you , she passes out of all this gloom , and makes sunlight in our house . We are never so cheerful as when she is at home . She always had the art of diffusing peace , but now it is positive cheerfulness . And about Leonard ; I doubt if the wisest and most thoughtful schoolmaster could teach half as much directly , as his mother does unconsciously and indirectly every hour that he is with her . Her noble , humble , pious endurance of the consequences of what was wrong in her early life , seems expressly fitted to act upon him , whose position is ( unjustly , for he has done no harm ) so similar to hers . "
178306	178394	177866	177867	Mr Benson	143	" Well ! I suppose we must leave it alone for the present . You will think me a hard practical man when I own to you , that all I expect from Leonard 's remaining a home - bird is that , with such a mother , it will do him no harm . At any rate , remember my offer is the same for a year -- two years hence , as now . What does she look forward to making him into , finally ? "
178395	178452	177423	177424	Mr Benson	143	" I do n't know . The wonder comes into my mind sometimes ; but never into hers , I think . It is part of her character -- part perhaps of that which made her what she was -- that she never looks forward , and seldom back . The present is enough for her . "
178502	178641	178499	178499	she	4508	" Now , do you know , I never liked poor Dick ; and yet I 'm angry with Mr Farquhar for getting him out of the partnership in such a summary way . I ca n't get over it , even though he has offered to send Leonard to school . And here he 's reigning lord - paramount at the office ! As if you , Thurstan , were n't as well able to teach him as any schoolmaster in England ! But I should not mind that affront , if I were not sorry to think of Dick ( though I never could abide him ) labouring away in Glasgow for a petty salary of nobody knows how little , while Mr Farquhar is taking halves , instead of thirds , of the profits here ! "
179170	179181	179183	179183	he	143	" I am determined to tell his father of this , "
179185	179206	179183	179183	he	143	" I think his family are far too obedient to his tacit prohibition of all mention of Richard 's name . "
179207	179211	179213	179214	Mr Benson	143	" Tacit prohibition ? "
179216	179395	179213	179214	Mr Benson	143	" Oh ! I dare say I use the words in a wrong sense for the correctness of a scholar ; but what I mean is , that he made a point of immediately leaving the room if Richard 's name was mentioned ; and did it in so marked a manner , that by degrees they understood that it was their father 's desire that he should never be alluded to ; which was all very well as long as there was nothing pleasant to be said about him ; but to - night I am going there , and shall take good care he does not escape me before I have told him all I have heard and observed about Richard . He will never be a hero of virtue , for his education has drained him of all moral courage ; but with care , and the absence of all strong temptation for a time , he will do very well ; nothing to gratify paternal pride , but certainly nothing to be ashamed of .

He stood in a farther corner of the room , watching his delirious master with affrighted eyes , not daring to come near him , nor yet willing to leave him . "

188684	189254	188548	188548	she	1141	" CHAPTER XXXV Out of Darkness into Light The third night after this was to be the crisis -- the turning - point between Life and Death . Mr Davis came again to pass it by the bedside of the sufferer . Ruth was there , constant and still , intent upon watching the symptoms , and acting according to them , in obedience to Mr Davis 's directions . She had never left the room . Every sense had been strained in watching -- every power of thought or judgment had been kept on the full stretch . Now that Mr Davis came and took her place , and that the room was quiet for the night , she became oppressed with heaviness , which yet did not tend to sleep . She could not remember the present time , or where she was . All times of her earliest youth -- the days of her childhood -- were in her memory with a minuteness and fulness of detail which was miserable ; for all along she felt that she had no real grasp on the scenes that were passing through her mind -- that , somehow , they were long gone by , and gone by for ever -- and yet she could not remember who she was now , nor where she was , and whether she had now any interests in life to take the place of those which she was conscious had passed away , although their remembrance filled her mind with painful acuteness . Her head lay on her arms , and they rested on the table . Every now and then she opened her eyes , and saw the large room , handsomely furnished with articles that were each one incongruous with the other , as if bought at sales . She saw the flickering night - light -- she heard the ticking of the watch , and the two breathings , each going on at a separate rate -- one hurried , abruptly stopping , and then panting violently , as if to make up for lost time ; and the other slow , steady , and regular , as if the breather was asleep ; but this supposition was contradicted by an occasional repressed sound of yawning . The sky through the uncurtained window looked dark and black -- would this night never have an end ? Had the sun gone down for ever , and would the world at last awaken to a general sense of everlasting night ? Then she felt as if she ought to get up , and go and see how the troubled sleeper in yonder bed was struggling through his illness ; but she could not remember who the sleeper was , and she shrunk from seeing some phantom - face on the pillow , such as now began to haunt the dark corners of the room , and look at her , jibbering and mowing as they looked . So she covered her face again , and sank into a whirling stupor of sense and feeling . By - and - by she heard her fellow - watcher stirring , and a dull wonder stole over her as to what he was doing ; but the heavy languor pressed her down , and kept her still . At last she heard the words , "
189258	189450	188548	188548	she	1141	" and listlessly obeyed the command . She had to steady herself in the rocking chamber before she could walk to the bed by which Mr Davis stood ; but the effort to do so roused her , and , although conscious of an oppressive headache , she viewed with sudden and clear vision all the circumstances of her present position . Mr Davis was near the head of the bed , holding the night - lamp high , and shading it with his hand , that it might not disturb the sick person , who lay with his face towards them , in feeble exhaustion , but with every sign that the violence of the fever had left him . It so happened that the rays of the lamp fell bright and full upon Ruth 's countenance , as she stood with her crimson lips parted with the hurrying breath , and the fever - flush brilliant on her cheeks . Her eyes were wide open , and their pupils distended . She looked on the invalid in silence , and hardly understood why Mr Davis had summoned her there . "
189465	189550	188548	188548	she	1141	" But she did not speak ; her looks were riveted on his softly - unclosing eyes , which met hers as they opened languidly . She could not stir or speak . She was held fast by that gaze of his , in which a faint recognition dawned , and grew to strength . He murmured some words . They strained their sense to hear . He repeated them even lower than before ; but this time they caught what he was saying . "
189566	189573	189574	189574	He	4043	" Mr Davis drew Ruth away . "
189579	189583	189574	189574	He	4043	" said he , "
189591	189668	188548	188548	she	1141	" The grey dawn was now filling the room with its cold light ; was it that made Ruth 's cheek so deadly pale ? Could that call out the wild entreaty of her look , as if imploring help against some cruel foe that held her fast , and was wrestling with her Spirit of Life ? She held Mr Davis 's arm . If she had let it go , she would have fallen . "
189673	189773	188548	188548	she	1141	" she said , and fainted dead away . Mr Davis carried her out of the chamber , and sent the groom to keep watch by his master . He ordered a fly to convey her to Mr Benson 's , and lifted her in when it came , for she was still half unconscious . It was he who carried her upstairs to her room , where Miss Benson and Sally undressed and laid her in her bed . He awaited their proceedings in Mr Benson 's study . When Mr Benson came in , Mr Davis said : "
189809	189810	189795	189797	a cruel fool	4046	" "
189818	189830	189831	189831	She	4045	" said Mr Benson , himself needing comfort in that shock . "

189907	189976	189977	189977	I	0	" He was cut short by Sally 's entrance and announcement that Ruth was now prepared to see him . From that time forward Mr Davis devoted all his leisure , his skill , his energy , to save her . He called on the rival surgeon to beg him to undertake the management of Mr Donne 's recovery , saying , with his usual self - mockery , "
190072	190130	190069	190069	you	4050	" The other surgeon bowed gravely , apparently taking Mr Davis in earnest , but certainly very glad of the job thus opportunely thrown in his way . In spite of Mr Davis 's real and deep anxiety about Ruth , he could not help chuckling over his rival 's literal interpretation of all he had said . "
190248	190283	190813	190813	mother	4127	" Indeed , however much Mr Davis might labour with all his professional skill -- however much they might all watch -- and pray -- and weep -- it was but too evident that Ruth "
190293	190727	190728	190728	I	0	" Poor , poor Ruth ! It might be that , utterly exhausted by watching and nursing , first in the hospital , and then by the bedside of her former lover , the power of her constitution was worn out ; or , it might be , her gentle , pliant sweetness , but she displayed no outrage or discord even in her delirium . There she lay in the attic - room in which her baby had been born , her watch over him kept , her confession to him made ; and now she was stretched on the bed in utter helplessness , softly gazing at vacancy with her open , unconscious eyes , from which all the depth of their meaning had fled , and all they told was of a sweet , child - like insanity within . The watchers could not touch her with their sympathy , or come near her in her dim world;--so , mutely , but looking at each other from time to time with tearful eyes , they took a poor comfort from the one evident fact that , though lost and gone astray , she was happy and at peace . They had never heard her sing ; indeed , the simple art which her mother had taught her , had died , with her early joyousness , at that dear mother 's death . But now she sang continually , very soft and low . She went from one childish ditty to another without let or pause , keeping a strange sort of time with her pretty fingers , as they closed and unclosed themselves upon the counterpane . She never looked at any one with the slightest glimpse of memory or intelligence in her face ; no , not even at Leonard . Her strength faded day by day ; but she knew it not . Her sweet lips were parted to sing , even after the breath and the power to do so had left her , and her fingers fell idly on the bed . Two days she lingered thus -- all but gone from them , and yet still there . They stood around her bedside , not speaking , or sighing , or moaning ; they were too much awed by the exquisite peacefulness of her look for that . Suddenly she opened wide her eyes , and gazed intently forwards , as if she saw some happy vision , which called out a lovely , rapturous , breathless smile . They held their very breaths . "
190734	190738	190728	190728	I	0	" said she . "
190744	190785	190728	190728	I	0	" she said . And , raising herself slowly , she stretched out her arms , and then fell back , very still for evermore . They did not speak . Mr Davis was the first to utter a word . "
190790	190794	190795	190795	She	4063	" said he . "
190799	190810	190811	190811	Mother	4127	" Out rang through the room the cry of Leonard : "
190840	190882	190883	190883	Mother	4127	" They had pent in his agony of apprehension till then , that no wail of her child might disturb her ineffable calm . But now there was a cry heard through the house , of one refusing to be comforted : "
190887	191011	191013	191013	She	4070	" But Ruth lay dead . CHAPTER XXXVI The End A stupor of grief succeeded to Leonard 's passionate cries . He became so much depressed , physically as well as mentally , before the end of the day , that Mr Davis was seriously alarmed for the consequences . He hailed with gladness a proposal made by the Farquhars , that the boy should be removed to their house , and placed under the fond care of his mother 's friend , who sent her own child to Abermouth the better to devote herself to Leonard . When they told him of this arrangement , he at first refused to go and leave _ her _ ; but when Mr Benson said : "
191028	191487	191013	191013	She	4070	" he went away very quietly ; not speaking a word , after Mr Benson had made the voluntary promise that he should see her once again . He neither spoke nor cried for many hours ; and all Jemima 's delicate wiles were called forth , before his heavy heart could find the relief of tears . And then he was so weak , and his pulse so low , that all who loved him feared for his life . Anxiety about him made a sad distraction from the sorrow for the dead . The three old people , who now formed the household in the Chapel - house , went about slowly and dreamily , each with a dull wonder at their hearts why they , the infirm and worn - out , were left , while she was taken in her lovely prime . The third day after Ruth 's death , a gentleman came to the door and asked to speak to Mr Benson . He was very much wrapped up in furs and cloaks , and the upper , exposed part of his face was sunk and hollow , like that of one but partially recovered from illness . Mr and Miss Benson were at Mr Farquhar 's , gone to see Leonard , and poor old Sally had been having a hearty cry over the kitchen fire before answering the door - knock . Her heart was tenderly inclined just then towards any one who had the aspect of suffering ; so , although her master was out , and she was usually chary of admitting strangers , she proposed to Mr Donne ( for it was he ) that he should come in and await Mr Benson 's return in the study . He was glad enough to avail himself of her offer ; for he was feeble and nervous , and come on a piece of business which he exceedingly disliked , and about which he felt very awkward . The fire was nearly , if not quite , out ; nor did Sally 's vigorous blows do much good , although she left the room with an assurance that it would soon burn up . He leant against the chimney - piece , thinking over events , and with a sensation of discomfort , both external and internal , growing and gathering upon him . He almost wondered whether the proposal he meant to make with regard to Leonard could not be better arranged by letter than by an interview . He became very shivery , and impatient of the state of indecision to which his bodily weakness had reduced him . Sally opened the door and came in . "
191497	191863	191013	191013	She	4070	" asked she , in a trembling voice , for she had learnt who the visitor was from the driver of the fly , who had run up to the house to inquire what was detaining the gentleman that he had brought from the Queen 's Hotel ; and , knowing that Ruth had caught the fatal fever from her attendance on Mr Donne , Sally imagined that it was but a piece of sad civility to invite him upstairs to see the poor dead body , which she had laid out and decked for the grave , with such fond care that she had grown strangely proud of its marble beauty . Mr Donne was glad enough of any proposal of a change from the cold and comfortless room where he had thought uneasy , remorseful thoughts . He fancied that a change of place would banish the train of reflection that was troubling him ; but the change he anticipated was to a well - warmed , cheerful sitting - room , with signs of life , and a bright fire therein ; and he was on the last flight of stairs,--at the door of the room where Ruth lay -- before he understood whither Sally was conducting him . He shrank back for an instant , and then a strange sting of curiosity impelled him on . He stood in the humble low - roofed attic , the window open , and the tops of the distant snow - covered hills filling up the whiteness of the general aspect . He muffled himself up in his cloak , and shuddered , while Sally reverently drew down the sheet , and showed the beautiful , calm , still face , on which the last rapturous smile still lingered , giving an ineffable look of bright serenity . Her arms were crossed over her breast ; the wimple - like cap marked the perfect oval of her face , while two braids of the waving auburn hair peeped out of the narrow border , and lay on the delicate cheeks . He was awed into admiration by the wonderful beauty of that dead woman . "
191869	191877	191013	191013	She	4070	" said he , beneath his breath . "
191889	191890	191013	191013	She	4070	" "
191894	191900	191013	191013	She	4070	" replied Sally , crying . "
191916	191932	191901	191901	Few	2104	" She quite shook with her sobbing . Mr Donne was disturbed by her distress . "
191943	191960	191961	191961	I	0	" he did not know what to say , and was becoming infected by her sorrow . "
191994	192064	191988	191988	yourself	4218	" He had pulled out a sovereign , and really had a kindly desire to console her , and reward her , in offering it to her . But she took her apron from her eyes , as soon as she became aware of what he was doing , and , still holding it midway in her hands , she looked at him indignantly , before she burst out : "
192093	192103	192083	192083	I	0	" said she , passionately addressing the motionless , serene body--"I
192210	192343	192344	192344	I	0	" She bent down and kissed the lips , from whose marble , unyielding touch Mr Donne recoiled , even in thought . Just then , Mr Benson entered the room . He had returned home before his sister , and come upstairs in search of Sally , to whom he wanted to speak on some subject relating to the funeral . He bowed in recognition of Mr Donne , whom he knew as the member for the town , and whose presence impressed him painfully , as his illness had been the proximate cause of Ruth 's death . But he tried to check this feeling , as it was no fault of Mr Donne 's . Sally stole out of the room , to cry at leisure in her kitchen . "
192351	192356	192344	192344	I	0	" said Mr Donne . "
192380	192381	192370	192370	she	4087	" "

192429	192434	192425	192425	her	4087	" said Mr Donne . "
192438	192525	192435	192436	Poor Ruth	81	" Mr Benson glanced up at him at the last word . How did he know her name ? To him she had only been Mrs Denbigh . But Mr Donne had no idea that he was talking to one unaware of the connexion that had formerly existed between them ; and , though he would have preferred carrying on the conversation in a warmer room , yet , as Mr Benson was still gazing at her with sad , lingering love , he went on : "
192583	192661	192662	192662	I	0	" Mr Benson looked up at him again , a stern light filling his eyes as he did so . He waited impatiently to hear more , either to quench or confirm his suspicions . If she had not been lying there , very still and calm , he would have forced the words out of Mr Donne , by some abrupt question . As it was , he listened silently , his heart quick - beating . "
192683	192702	192705	192705	I	0	" Mr Benson set his teeth hard together , to keep in words little short of a curse . "
192719	192731	192732	192732	I	0	" catching the gleam of indignation on Mr Benson 's face ; "
192760	192768	192732	192732	I	0	" said he , his voice faltering ; "
192871	192921	192867	192867	Ruth	81	" Mr Benson did not speak . He could not , till he had gathered some peace from looking at the ineffable repose of the Dead . Then , before he answered , he covered up her face ; and in his voice there was the stillness of ice . "
192966	192975	192957	192957	I	0	" said he , bending towards the Dead . "
193004	193087	192998	192998	I	0	" All the way down , Mr Benson heard Mr Donne 's voice urging and entreating , but the words he could not recognise for the thoughts that filled his brain -- the rapid putting together of events that was going on there . And when Mr Donne turned at the door , to speak again , and repeat his offers of service to Leonard , Mr Benson made answer , without well knowing whether the answer fitted the question or not : "
193125	193136	193137	193144	An ill - bred , puritanical old fellow	4104	" He shut the door in Mr Donne 's face . "
193199	194502	194503	194503	He	4107	" Mr Benson was bitterly oppressed with this interview ; it disturbed the peace with which he was beginning to contemplate events . His anger ruffled him , although such anger had been just , and such indignation well deserved ; and both had been unconsciously present in his heart for years against the unknown seducer , whom he met face to face by the death - bed of Ruth . It gave him a shock which he did not recover from for many days . He was nervously afraid lest Mr Donne should appear at the funeral ; and not all the reasons he alleged to himself against this apprehension , put it utterly away from him . Before then , however , he heard casually ( for he would allow himself no inquiries ) that he had left the town . No ! Ruth 's funeral passed over in calm and simple solemnity . Her child , her own household , her friend , and Mr Farquhar , quietly walked after the bier , which was borne by some of the poor to whom she had been very kind in her lifetime . And many others stood aloof in the little burying - ground , sadly watching that last ceremony . They slowly dispersed ; Mr Benson leading Leonard by the hand , and secretly wondering at his self - restraint . Almost as soon as they had let themselves into the Chapel - house , a messenger brought a note from Mrs Bradshaw , with a pot of quince marmalade , which , she said to Miss Benson , she thought that Leonard might fancy , and if he did , they were to be sure and let her know , as she had plenty more ; or , was there anything else that he would like ? She would gladly make him whatever he fancied . Poor Leonard ! he lay stretched on the sofa , white and tearless , beyond the power of any such comfort , however kindly offered ; but this was only one of the many homely , simple attentions , which all came round him to offer , from Mr Grey , the rector , down to the nameless poor who called at the back door to inquire how it fared with _ her _ child . Mr Benson was anxious , according to Dissenting custom , to preach an appropriate funeral sermon . It was the last office he could render to her ; it should be done well and carefully . Moreover , it was possible that the circumstances of her life , which were known to all , might be made effective in this manner to work conviction of many truths . Accordingly , he made great preparation of thought and paper ; he laboured hard , destroying sheet after sheet -- his eyes filling with tears between - whiles , as he remembered some fresh proof of the humility and sweetness of her life . Oh , that he could do her justice ! but words seemed hard and inflexible , and refused to fit themselves to his ideas . He sat late on Saturday , writing ; he watched through the night till Sunday morning was far advanced . He had never taken such pains with any sermon , and he was only half satisfied with it after all . Mrs Farquhar had comforted the bitterness of Sally 's grief by giving her very handsome mourning . At any rate , she felt oddly proud and exulting when she thought of her new black gown ; but when she remembered why she wore it , she scolded herself pretty sharply for her satisfaction , and took to crying afresh with redoubled vigour . She spent the Sunday morning in alternately smoothing down her skirts and adjusting her broad hemmed collar , or bemoaning the occasion with tearful earnestness . But the sorrow overcame the little quaint vanity of her heart , as she saw troop after troop of humbly - dressed mourners pass by into the old chapel . They were very poor -- but each had mounted some rusty piece of crape , or some faded black ribbon . The old came halting and slow -- the mothers carried their quiet , awe - struck babes . And not only these were there -- but others -- equally unaccustomed to nonconformist worship : Mr Davis , for instance , to whom Sally acted as chaperone ; for he sat in the minister 's pew , as a stranger ; and , as she afterwards said , she had a fellow - feeling with him , being a Church - woman herself , and Dissenters had such awkward ways ; however , she had been there before , so she could set him to rights about their fashions . From the pulpit , Mr Benson saw one and all -- the well - filled Bradshaw pew -- all in deep mourning , Mr Bradshaw conspicuously so ( he would have attended the funeral gladly if they would have asked him)--the Farquhars -- the many strangers -- the still more numerous poor -- one or two wild - looking outcasts , who stood afar off , but wept silently and continually . Mr Benson 's heart grew very full . His voice trembled as he read and prayed . But he steadied it as he opened his sermon -- his great , last effort in her honour -- the labour that he had prayed God to bless to the hearts of many . For an instant the old man looked on all the upturned faces , listening , with wet eyes , to hear what he could say to interpret that which was in their hearts , dumb and unshaped , of God 's doings as shown in her life . He looked , and , as he gazed , a mist came before him , and he could not see his sermon , nor his hearers , but only Ruth , as she had been -- stricken low , and crouching from sight , in the upland field by Llan - dhu -- like a woeful , hunted creature . And now her life was over ! her struggle ended ! Sermon and all was forgotten . He sat down , and hid his face in his hands for a minute or so . Then he arose , pale and serene . He put the sermon away , and opened the Bible , and read the seventh chapter of Revelations , beginning at the ninth verse . Before it was finished , most of his hearers were in tears . It came home to them as more appropriate than any sermon could have been . Even Sally , though full of anxiety as to what her fellow - Churchman would think of such proceedings , let the sobs come freely as she heard the words : And he said to me , These are they which came out of great tribulation , and have washed their robes , and made them white in the blood of the Lamb . Therefore are they before the throne of God , and serve him day and night in his temple ; and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them . They shall hunger no more , neither thirst any more ; neither shall the sun light on them , nor any heat . For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them , and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters , and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes . "

Accordingly , he ordered the first stonemason of the town to meet him in the chapel - yard on Monday morning , to take measurement and receive directions for a tombstone . They threaded their way among the grassy heaps to where Ruth was buried , in the south corner , beneath the great Wych - elm . When they got there , Leonard raised himself up from the new - stirred turf . His face was swollen with weeping ; but when he saw Mr Bradshaw he calmed himself , and checked his sobs , and , as an explanation of being where he was when thus surprised , he could find nothing to say but the simple words : "
