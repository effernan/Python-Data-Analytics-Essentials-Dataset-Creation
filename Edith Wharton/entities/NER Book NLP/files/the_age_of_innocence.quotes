You 're a pianist yourself , I believe ? Well , do you want to hear Sarasate play tomorrow evening at my house ? You know I 've something going on every Sunday evening -- it 's the day when New York does n't know what to do with itself , and so I say to it : ' Come and be amused .

It 's odd she did n't mention it : she lunched with us today , and spoke of Mr. Beaufort 's having sent her wonderful orchids , and cousin Henry van der Luyden a whole hamper of carnations from Skuytercliff . She seems so surprised to receive flowers . Do n't people send them in Europe ? She thinks it such a pretty custom . "

28575	28620	28490	28490	He	1450	" No ; but you DID ask the Wellands to announce your engagement sooner so that we might all back her up ; and if it had n't been for that cousin Louisa would never have invited her to the dinner for the Duke . "
28621	28659	28537	28537	her	1453	" Well -- what harm was there in inviting her ? She was the best - looking woman in the room ; she made the dinner a little less funereal than the usual van der Luyden banquet . "

Instead of massing them in big bunches as our head - gardener does , she had scattered them about loosely , here and there ... I ca n't say how . The Duke had told me : he said : ' Go and see how cleverly she 's arranged her drawing - room . ' And she has . I should really like to take Louisa to see her , if the neighbourhood were not so -- unpleasant . "

Louisa and I are very fond of our cousin -- but it 's hopeless to expect people who are accustomed to the European courts to trouble themselves about our little republican distinctions . The Duke goes where he 's amused . "
29903	30008	29892	29895	Mr. van der Luyden	304	" Yes -- it seems he took her with him last night to Mrs. Lemuel Struthers 's . Sillerton Jackson has just been to us with the foolish story , and Louisa was rather troubled . So I thought the shortest way was to go straight to Countess Olenska and explain -- by the merest hint , you know -- how we feel in New York about certain things . I felt I might , without indelicacy , because the evening she dined with us she rather suggested ... rather let me see that she would be grateful for guidance . And she WAS . "

30654	30831	30634	30634	I	0	" Archer felt the blood in his temples . He had seen the Countess Olenska only once since his visit to her , and then at the Opera , in the Mingott box . During this interval she had become a less vivid and importunate image , receding from his foreground as May Welland resumed her rightful place in it . He had not heard her divorce spoken of since Janey 's first random allusion to it , and had dismissed the tale as unfounded gossip . Theoretically , the idea of divorce was almost as distasteful to him as to his mother ; and he was annoyed that Mr. Letterblair ( no doubt prompted by old Catherine Mingott ) should be so evidently planning to draw him into the affair . After all , there were plenty of Mingott men for such jobs , and as yet he was not even a Mingott by marriage . He waited for the senior partner to continue . Mr. Letterblair unlocked a drawer and drew out a packet . "

30953	31032	30948	30948	They	1496	" Archer felt his temper rising . He had been somewhat languidly drifting with events for the last fortnight , and letting May 's fair looks and radiant nature obliterate the rather importunate pressure of the Mingott claims . But this behest of old Mrs. Mingott 's roused him to a sense of what the clan thought they had the right to exact from a prospective son - in - law ; and he chafed at the role . "

31155	31393	31148	31148	I	0	" Archer withdrew reluctantly with the unwelcome documents . Since their last meeting he had half - unconsciously collaborated with events in ridding himself of the burden of Madame Olenska . His hour alone with her by the firelight had drawn them into a momentary intimacy on which the Duke of St. Austrey 's intrusion with Mrs. Lemuel Struthers , and the Countess 's joyous greeting of them , had rather providentially broken . Two days later Archer had assisted at the comedy of her reinstatement in the van der Luydens ' favour , and had said to himself , with a touch of tartness , that a lady who knew how to thank all - powerful elderly gentlemen to such good purpose for a bunch of flowers did not need either the private consolations or the public championship of a young man of his small compass . To look at the matter in this light simplified his own case and surprisingly furbished up all the dim domestic virtues . He could not picture May Welland , in whatever conceivable emergency , hawking about her private difficulties and lavishing her confidences on strange men ; and she had never seemed to him finer or fairer than in the week that followed . He had even yielded to her wish for a long engagement , since she had found the one disarming answer to his plea for haste . "
31421	31435	31404	31405	your parents	1502	" he argued ; and she had answered , with her clearest look : "
31463	31607	31452	31452	they	1502	" That was the old New York note ; that was the kind of answer he would like always to be sure of his wife 's making . If one had habitually breathed the New York air there were times when anything less crystalline seemed stifling . The papers he had retired to read did not tell him much in fact ; but they plunged him into an atmosphere in which he choked and spluttered . They consisted mainly of an exchange of letters between Count Olenski 's solicitors and a French legal firm to whom the Countess had applied for the settlement of her financial situation . There was also a short letter from the Count to his wife : after reading it , Newland Archer rose , jammed the papers back into their envelope , and reentered Mr. Letterblair 's office . "

31674	31823	31665	31665	you	3197	" Newland Archer walked straight home again that afternoon . It was a winter evening of transparent clearness , with an innocent young moon above the house - tops ; and he wanted to fill his soul 's lungs with the pure radiance , and not exchange a word with any one till he and Mr. Letterblair were closeted together after dinner . It was impossible to decide otherwise than he had done : he must see Madame Olenska himself rather than let her secrets be bared to other eyes . A great wave of compassion had swept away his indifference and impatience : she stood before him as an exposed and pitiful figure , to be saved at all costs from farther wounding herself in her mad plunges against fate . He remembered what she had told him of Mrs. Welland 's request to be spared whatever was "
31825	31852	31856	31856	Pharisees	1509	" in her history , and winced at the thought that it was perhaps this attitude of mind which kept the New York air so pure . "
31860	31948	31949	31952	that kind of woman	1510	" he wondered , puzzled by the effort to reconcile his instinctive disgust at human vileness with his equally instinctive pity for human frailty . For the first time he perceived how elementary his own principles had always been . He passed for a young man who had not been afraid of risks , and he knew that his secret love - affair with poor silly Mrs. Thorley Rushworth had not been too secret to invest him with a becoming air of adventure . But Mrs. Rushworth was "
31953	32088	31856	31856	Pharisees	1509	" ; foolish , vain , clandestine by nature , and far more attracted by the secrecy and peril of the affair than by such charms and qualities as he possessed . When the fact dawned on him it nearly broke his heart , but now it seemed the redeeming feature of the case . The affair , in short , had been of the kind that most of the young men of his age had been through , and emerged from with calm consciences and an undisturbed belief in the abysmal distinction between the women one loved and respected and those one enjoyed -- and pitied . In this view they were sedulously abetted by their mothers , aunts and other elderly female relatives , who all shared Mrs. Archer 's belief that when "
32092	32387	31856	31856	Pharisees	1509	" it was undoubtedly foolish of the man , but somehow always criminal of the woman . All the elderly ladies whom Archer knew regarded any woman who loved imprudently as necessarily unscrupulous and designing , and mere simple - minded man as powerless in her clutches . The only thing to do was to persuade him , as early as possible , to marry a nice girl , and then trust to her to look after him . In the complicated old European communities , Archer began to guess , love - problems might be less simple and less easily classified . Rich and idle and ornamental societies must produce many more such situations ; and there might even be one in which a woman naturally sensitive and aloof would yet , from the force of circumstances , from sheer defencelessness and loneliness , be drawn into a tie inexcusable by conventional standards . On reaching home he wrote a line to the Countess Olenska , asking at what hour of the next day she could receive him , and despatched it by a messenger - boy , who returned presently with a word to the effect that she was going to Skuytercliff the next morning to stay over Sunday with the van der Luydens , but that he would find her alone that evening after dinner . The note was written on a rather untidy half - sheet , without date or address , but her hand was firm and free . He was amused at the idea of her week - ending in the stately solitude of Skuytercliff , but immediately afterward felt that there , of all places , she would most feel the chill of minds rigorously averted from the "

He had formed his own opinion from the papers entrusted to him , and did not especially want to go into the matter with his senior partner . Mr. Letterblair was a widower , and they dined alone , copiously and slowly , in a dark shabby room hung with yellowing prints of "

After a velvety oyster soup came shad and cucumbers , then a young broiled turkey with corn fritters , followed by a canvas - back with currant jelly and a celery mayonnaise . Mr. Letterblair , who lunched on a sandwich and tea , dined deliberately and deeply , and insisted on his guest 's doing the same . Finally , when the closing rites had been accomplished , the cloth was removed , cigars were lit , and Mr. Letterblair , leaning back in his chair and pushing the port westward , said , spreading his back agreeably to the coal fire behind him : "

Archer understood that he ran the risk of having his mandate withdrawn , and for some obscure reason he disliked the prospect . Now that the job had been thrust on him he did not propose to relinquish it ; and , to guard against the possibility , he saw that he must reassure the unimaginative old man who was the legal conscience of the Mingotts . "
33242	33561	33236	33237	Madame Olenska	240	" Mr. Letterblair nodded approvingly at an excess of caution worthy of the best New York tradition , and the young man , glancing at his watch , pleaded an engagement and took leave . XII . Old - fashioned New York dined at seven , and the habit of after - dinner calls , though derided in Archer 's set , still generally prevailed . As the young man strolled up Fifth Avenue from Waverley Place , the long thoroughfare was deserted but for a group of carriages standing before the Reggie Chiverses ' ( where there was a dinner for the Duke ) , and the occasional figure of an elderly gentleman in heavy overcoat and muffler ascending a brownstone doorstep and disappearing into a gas - lit hall . Thus , as Archer crossed Washington Square , he remarked that old Mr. du Lac was calling on his cousins the Dagonets , and turning down the corner of West Tenth Street he saw Mr. Skipworth , of his own firm , obviously bound on a visit to the Miss Lannings . A little farther up Fifth Avenue , Beaufort appeared on his doorstep , darkly projected against a blaze of light , descended to his private brougham , and rolled away to a mysterious and probably unmentionable destination . It was not an Opera night , and no one was giving a party , so that Beaufort 's outing was undoubtedly of a clandestine nature . Archer connected it in his mind with a little house beyond Lexington Avenue in which beribboned window curtains and flower - boxes had recently appeared , and before whose newly painted door the canary - coloured brougham of Miss Fanny Ring was frequently seen to wait . Beyond the small and slippery pyramid which composed Mrs. Archer 's world lay the almost unmapped quarter inhabited by artists , musicians and "
33566	33623	33236	33237	Madame Olenska	240	" These scattered fragments of humanity had never shown any desire to be amalgamated with the social structure . In spite of odd ways they were said to be , for the most part , quite respectable ; but they preferred to keep to themselves . Medora Manson , in her prosperous days , had inaugurated a "
33626	33791	33807	33808	gentlemen "	3536	" ; but it had soon died out owing to the reluctance of the literary to frequent it . Others had made the same attempt , and there was a household of Blenkers -- an intense and voluble mother , and three blowsy daughters who imitated her -- where one met Edwin Booth and Patti and William Winter , and the new Shakespearian actor George Rignold , and some of the magazine editors and musical and literary critics . Mrs. Archer and her group felt a certain timidity concerning these persons . They were odd , they were uncertain , they had things one did n't know about in the background of their lives and minds . Literature and art were deeply respected in the Archer set , and Mrs. Archer was always at pains to tell her children how much more agreeable and cultivated society had been when it included such figures as Washington Irving , Fitz - Greene Halleck and the poet of "

Possibly Beaufort , who was her match in daring , would have succeeded in bringing about a fusion ; but his grand house and silk - stockinged footmen were an obstacle to informal sociability . Moreover , he was as illiterate as old Mrs. Mingott , and considered "
34025	34135	34022	34025	fellows who wrote "	3541	" as the mere paid purveyors of rich men 's pleasures ; and no one rich enough to influence his opinion had ever questioned it . Newland Archer had been aware of these things ever since he could remember , and had accepted them as part of the structure of his universe . He knew that there were societies where painters and poets and novelists and men of science , and even great actors , were as sought after as Dukes ; he had often pictured to himself what it would have been to live in the intimacy of drawing - rooms dominated by the talk of Merimee ( whose "
34140	34176	34022	34025	fellows who wrote "	3541	" was one of his inseparables ) , of Thackeray , Browning or William Morris . But such things were inconceivable in New York , and unsettling to think of . Archer knew most of the "
34181	34344	34022	34025	fellows who wrote "	3541	" the musicians and the painters : he met them at the Century , or at the little musical and theatrical clubs that were beginning to come into existence . He enjoyed them there , and was bored with them at the Blenkers ' , where they were mingled with fervid and dowdy women who passed them about like captured curiosities ; and even after his most exciting talks with Ned Winsett he always came away with the feeling that if his world was small , so was theirs , and that the only way to enlarge either was to reach a stage of manners where they would naturally merge . He was reminded of this by trying to picture the society in which the Countess Olenska had lived and suffered , and also -- perhaps -- tasted mysterious joys . He remembered with what amusement she had told him that her grandmother Mingott and the Wellands objected to her living in a "

34356	34415	34352	34354	people who wrote	1528	" It was not the peril but the poverty that her family disliked ; but that shade escaped her , and she supposed they considered literature compromising . She herself had no fears of it , and the books scattered about her drawing - room ( a part of the house in which books were usually supposed to be "
34419	34805	34979	34979	Lord	1529	" ) , though chiefly works of fiction , had whetted Archer 's interest with such new names as those of Paul Bourget , Huysmans , and the Goncourt brothers . Ruminating on these things as he approached her door , he was once more conscious of the curious way in which she reversed his values , and of the need of thinking himself into conditions incredibly different from any that he knew if he were to be of use in her present difficulty . Nastasia opened the door , smiling mysteriously . On the bench in the hall lay a sable - lined overcoat , a folded opera hat of dull silk with a gold J. B. on the lining , and a white silk muffler : there was no mistaking the fact that these costly articles were the property of Julius Beaufort . Archer was angry : so angry that he came near scribbling a word on his card and going away ; then he remembered that in writing to Madame Olenska he had been kept by excess of discretion from saying that he wished to see her privately . He had therefore no one but himself to blame if she had opened her doors to other visitors ; and he entered the drawing - room with the dogged determination to make Beaufort feel himself in the way , and to outstay him . The banker stood leaning against the mantelshelf , which was draped with an old embroidery held in place by brass candelabra containing church candles of yellowish wax . He had thrust his chest out , supporting his shoulders against the mantel and resting his weight on one large patent - leather foot . As Archer entered he was smiling and looking down on his hostess , who sat on a sofa placed at right angles to the chimney . A table banked with flowers formed a screen behind it , and against the orchids and azaleas which the young man recognised as tributes from the Beaufort hot - houses , Madame Olenska sat half - reclined , her head propped on a hand and her wide sleeve leaving the arm bare to the elbow . It was usual for ladies who received in the evenings to wear what were called "
34809	34978	34979	34979	Lord	1529	" : a close - fitting armour of whale - boned silk , slightly open in the neck , with lace ruffles filling in the crack , and tight sleeves with a flounce uncovering just enough wrist to show an Etruscan gold bracelet or a velvet band . But Madame Olenska , heedless of tradition , was attired in a long robe of red velvet bordered about the chin and down the front with glossy black fur . Archer remembered , on his last visit to Paris , seeing a portrait by the new painter , Carolus Duran , whose pictures were the sensation of the Salon , in which the lady wore one of these bold sheath - like robes with her chin nestling in fur . There was something perverse and provocative in the notion of fur worn in the evening in a heated drawing - room , and in the combination of a muffled throat and bare arms ; but the effect was undeniably pleasing .

A little travelling clock ticked purringly at her elbow , and a log broke in two and sent up a shower of sparks . The whole hushed and brooding room seemed to be waiting silently with Archer . "

The mere suspicion that the thought was in her mind made him feel harshly and impatiently toward her . "

Madame Olenska rose , wound it up and returned to the fire , but without resuming her seat . Her remaining on her feet seemed to signify that there was nothing more for either of them to say , and Archer stood up also . "

She drew them away , and he turned to the door , found his coat and hat under the faint gas - light of the hall , and plunged out into the winter night bursting with the belated eloquence of the inarticulate . XIII . It was a crowded night at Wallack 's theatre . The play was "
37709	37981	37706	37707	The Shaughraun	384	" with Dion Boucicault in the title role and Harry Montague and Ada Dyas as the lovers . The popularity of the admirable English company was at its height , and the Shaughraun always packed the house . In the galleries the enthusiasm was unreserved ; in the stalls and boxes , people smiled a little at the hackneyed sentiments and clap - trap situations , and enjoyed the play as much as the galleries did . There was one episode , in particular , that held the house from floor to ceiling . It was that in which Harry Montague , after a sad , almost monosyllabic scene of parting with Miss Dyas , bade her good - bye , and turned to go . The actress , who was standing near the mantelpiece and looking down into the fire , wore a gray cashmere dress without fashionable loopings or trimmings , moulded to her tall figure and flowing in long lines about her feet . Around her neck was a narrow black velvet ribbon with the ends falling down her back . When her wooer turned from her she rested her arms against the mantel - shelf and bowed her face in her hands . On the threshold he paused to look at her ; then he stole back , lifted one of the ends of velvet ribbon , kissed it , and left the room without her hearing him or changing her attitude . And on this silent parting the curtain fell . It was always for the sake of that particular scene that Newland Archer went to see "
37985	38454	38455	38456	the secretary	3199	" He thought the adieux of Montague and Ada Dyas as fine as anything he had ever seen Croisette and Bressant do in Paris , or Madge Robertson and Kendal in London ; in its reticence , its dumb sorrow , it moved him more than the most famous histrionic outpourings . On the evening in question the little scene acquired an added poignancy by reminding him -- he could not have said why -- of his leave - taking from Madame Olenska after their confidential talk a week or ten days earlier . It would have been as difficult to discover any resemblance between the two situations as between the appearance of the persons concerned . Newland Archer could not pretend to anything approaching the young English actor 's romantic good looks , and Miss Dyas was a tall red - haired woman of monumental build whose pale and pleasantly ugly face was utterly unlike Ellen Olenska 's vivid countenance . Nor were Archer and Madame Olenska two lovers parting in heart - broken silence ; they were client and lawyer separating after a talk which had given the lawyer the worst possible impression of the client 's case . Wherein , then , lay the resemblance that made the young man 's heart beat with a kind of retrospective excitement ? It seemed to be in Madame Olenska 's mysterious faculty of suggesting tragic and moving possibilities outside the daily run of experience . She had hardly ever said a word to him to produce this impression , but it was a part of her , either a projection of her mysterious and outlandish background or of something inherently dramatic , passionate and unusual in herself . Archer had always been inclined to think that chance and circumstance played a small part in shaping people 's lots compared with their innate tendency to have things happen to them . This tendency he had felt from the first in Madame Olenska . The quiet , almost passive young woman struck him as exactly the kind of person to whom things were bound to happen , no matter how much she shrank from them and went out of her way to avoid them . The exciting fact was her having lived in an atmosphere so thick with drama that her own tendency to provoke it had apparently passed unperceived . It was precisely the odd absence of surprise in her that gave him the sense of her having been plucked out of a very maelstrom : the things she took for granted gave the measure of those she had rebelled against . Archer had left her with the conviction that Count Olenski 's accusation was not unfounded . The mysterious person who figured in his wife 's past as "
38457	38726	38455	38456	the secretary	3199	" had probably not been unrewarded for his share in her escape . The conditions from which she had fled were intolerable , past speaking of , past believing : she was young , she was frightened , she was desperate -- what more natural than that she should be grateful to her rescuer ? The pity was that her gratitude put her , in the law 's eyes and the world 's , on a par with her abominable husband . Archer had made her understand this , as he was bound to do ; he had also made her understand that simplehearted kindly New York , on whose larger charity she had apparently counted , was precisely the place where she could least hope for indulgence . To have to make this fact plain to her -- and to witness her resigned acceptance of it -- had been intolerably painful to him . He felt himself drawn to her by obscure feelings of jealousy and pity , as if her dumbly - confessed error had put her at his mercy , humbling yet endearing her . He was glad it was to him she had revealed her secret , rather than to the cold scrutiny of Mr. Letterblair , or the embarrassed gaze of her family . He immediately took it upon himself to assure them both that she had given up her idea of seeking a divorce , basing her decision on the fact that she had understood the uselessness of the proceeding ; and with infinite relief they had all turned their eyes from the "

38743	38783	38735	38735	I	0	" Mrs. Welland had said proudly of her future son - in - law ; and old Mrs. Mingott , who had summoned him for a confidential interview , had congratulated him on his cleverness , and added impatiently : "
38823	39092	39094	39094	you	1599	" These incidents had made the memory of his last talk with Madame Olenska so vivid to the young man that as the curtain fell on the parting of the two actors his eyes filled with tears , and he stood up to leave the theatre . In doing so , he turned to the side of the house behind him , and saw the lady of whom he was thinking seated in a box with the Beauforts , Lawrence Lefferts and one or two other men . He had not spoken with her alone since their evening together , and had tried to avoid being with her in company ; but now their eyes met , and as Mrs. Beaufort recognised him at the same time , and made her languid little gesture of invitation , it was impossible not to go into the box . Beaufort and Lefferts made way for him , and after a few words with Mrs. Beaufort , who always preferred to look beautiful and not have to talk , Archer seated himself behind Madame Olenska . There was no one else in the box but Mr. Sillerton Jackson , who was telling Mrs. Beaufort in a confidential undertone about Mrs. Lemuel Struthers 's last Sunday reception ( where some people reported that there had been dancing ) . Under cover of this circumstantial narrative , to which Mrs. Beaufort listened with her perfect smile , and her head at just the right angle to be seen in profile from the stalls , Madame Olenska turned and spoke in a low voice . "
39097	39106	39107	39107	he	1599	" she asked , glancing toward the stage , "
39119	39214	39215	39215	I	0	" Archer reddened , and his heart gave a leap of surprise . He had called only twice on Madame Olenska , and each time he had sent her a box of yellow roses , and each time without a card . She had never before made any allusion to the flowers , and he supposed she had never thought of him as the sender . Now her sudden recognition of the gift , and her associating it with the tender leave - taking on the stage , filled him with an agitated pleasure . "
39239	39280	39222	39222	I	0	" he said . To his surprise her colour rose , reluctantly and duskily . She looked down at the mother - of - pearl opera - glass in her smoothly gloved hands , and said , after a pause : "
39290	39291	39283	39283	you	0	" "
39298	39711	39292	39292	I	0	" he answered , faintly annoyed by the question . In obedience to a long - established habit , the Wellands had left the previous week for St. Augustine , where , out of regard for the supposed susceptibility of Mr. Welland 's bronchial tubes , they always spent the latter part of the winter . Mr. Welland was a mild and silent man , with no opinions but with many habits . With these habits none might interfere ; and one of them demanded that his wife and daughter should always go with him on his annual journey to the south . To preserve an unbroken domesticity was essential to his peace of mind ; he would not have known where his hair - brushes were , or how to provide stamps for his letters , if Mrs. Welland had not been there to tell him . As all the members of the family adored each other , and as Mr. Welland was the central object of their idolatry , it never occurred to his wife and May to let him go to St. Augustine alone ; and his sons , who were both in the law , and could not leave New York during the winter , always joined him for Easter and travelled back with him . It was impossible for Archer to discuss the necessity of May 's accompanying her father . The reputation of the Mingotts ' family physician was largely based on the attack of pneumonia which Mr. Welland had never had ; and his insistence on St. Augustine was therefore inflexible . Originally , it had been intended that May 's engagement should not be announced till her return from Florida , and the fact that it had been made known sooner could not be expected to alter Mr. Welland 's plans . Archer would have liked to join the travellers and have a few weeks of sunshine and boating with his betrothed ; but he too was bound by custom and conventions . Little arduous as his professional duties were , he would have been convicted of frivolity by the whole Mingott clan if he had suggested asking for a holiday in mid - winter ; and he accepted May 's departure with the resignation which he perceived would have to be one of the principal constituents of married life . He was conscious that Madame Olenska was looking at him under lowered lids . "

39804	39870	39798	39798	I	0	" she ended , lifting her opera - glass quickly to her eyes as the door of the box opened and Beaufort 's resonant voice broke in on them . Archer stood up , and left the box and the theatre . Only the day before he had received a letter from May Welland in which , with characteristic candour , she had asked him to "

40036	40218	40015	40015	you	1611	" His wise May -- how he had loved her for that letter ! But he had not meant to act on it ; he was too busy , to begin with , and he did not care , as an engaged man , to play too conspicuously the part of Madame Olenska 's champion . He had an idea that she knew how to take care of herself a good deal better than the ingenuous May imagined . She had Beaufort at her feet , Mr. van der Luyden hovering above her like a protecting deity , and any number of candidates ( Lawrence Lefferts among them ) waiting their opportunity in the middle distance . Yet he never saw her , or exchanged a word with her , without feeling that , after all , May 's ingenuousness almost amounted to a gift of divination . Ellen Olenska was lonely and she was unhappy . XIV . As he came out into the lobby Archer ran across his friend Ned Winsett , the only one among what Janey called his "
40221	40332	40392	40392	she	1614	" with whom he cared to probe into things a little deeper than the average level of club and chop - house banter . He had caught sight , across the house , of Winsett 's shabby round - shouldered back , and had once noticed his eyes turned toward the Beaufort box . The two men shook hands , and Winsett proposed a bock at a little German restaurant around the corner . Archer , who was not in the mood for the kind of talk they were likely to get there , declined on the plea that he had work to do at home ; and Winsett said : "
40352	40363	40347	40349	the Industrious Apprentice	1613	" They strolled along together , and presently Winsett said : "
40404	40465	40398	40398	Lefferts	223	" Archer , he could not have said why , was slightly annoyed . What the devil did Ned Winsett want with Ellen Olenska 's name ? And above all , why did he couple it with Lefferts 's ? It was unlike Winsett to manifest such curiosity ; but after all , Archer remembered , he was a journalist . "

But it was just like Ellen , he felt , to have rushed in bareheaded , carrying the boy in her arms , and to have dazzled poor Mrs. Winsett into forgetting to ask who she was . "

40827	41042	40824	40824	my	0	" He slouched off across Broadway , and Archer stood looking after him and musing on his last words . Ned Winsett had those flashes of penetration ; they were the most interesting thing about him , and always made Archer wonder why they had allowed him to accept failure so stolidly at an age when most men are still struggling . Archer had known that Winsett had a wife and child , but he had never seen them . The two men always met at the Century , or at some haunt of journalists and theatrical people , such as the restaurant where Winsett had proposed to go for a bock . He had given Archer to understand that his wife was an invalid ; which might be true of the poor lady , or might merely mean that she was lacking in social gifts or in evening clothes , or in both . Winsett himself had a savage abhorrence of social observances : Archer , who dressed in the evening because he thought it cleaner and more comfortable to do so , and who had never stopped to consider that cleanliness and comfort are two of the costliest items in a modest budget , regarded Winsett 's attitude as part of the boring "

Nevertheless , he was always stimulated by Winsett , and whenever he caught sight of the journalist 's lean bearded face and melancholy eyes he would rout him out of his corner and carry him off for a long talk . Winsett was not a journalist by choice . He was a pure man of letters , untimely born in a world that had no need of letters ; but after publishing one volume of brief and exquisite literary appreciations , of which one hundred and twenty copies were sold , thirty given away , and the balance eventually destroyed by the publishers ( as per contract ) to make room for more marketable material , he had abandoned his real calling , and taken a sub - editorial job on a women 's weekly , where fashion - plates and paper patterns alternated with New England love - stories and advertisements of temperance drinks . On the subject of "
41251	41344	40811	40811	I	0	" ( as the paper was called ) he was inexhaustibly entertaining ; but beneath his fun lurked the sterile bitterness of the still young man who has tried and given up . His conversation always made Archer take the measure of his own life , and feel how little it contained ; but Winsett 's , after all , contained still less , and though their common fund of intellectual interests and curiosities made their talks exhilarating , their exchange of views usually remained within the limits of a pensive dilettantism . "

41439	41480	41481	41482	a gentleman	3166	" Archer threw his head back and laughed . There one saw at a flash the unbridgeable difference between men like Winsett and the others -- Archer 's kind . Every one in polite circles knew that , in America , "
41489	41508	41481	41482	a gentleman	3166	" But , since he could hardly put it in that way to Winsett , he answered evasively : "

41549	41631	41545	41545	they	1634	" Archer 's laugh lingered on his lips in a slightly condescending smile . It was useless to prolong the discussion : everybody knew the melancholy fate of the few gentlemen who had risked their clean linen in municipal or state politics in New York . The day was past when that sort of thing was possible : the country was in possession of the bosses and the emigrant , and decent people had to fall back on sport or culture . "
41762	42005	41758	41758	I	0	" Archer mentally shrugged his shoulders and turned the conversation back to books , where Winsett , if uncertain , was always interesting . Emigrate ! As if a gentleman could abandon his own country ! One could no more do that than one could roll up one 's sleeves and go down into the muck . A gentleman simply stayed at home and abstained . But you could n't make a man like Winsett see that ; and that was why the New York of literary clubs and exotic restaurants , though a first shake made it seem more of a kaleidoscope , turned out , in the end , to be a smaller box , with a more monotonous pattern , than the assembled atoms of Fifth Avenue . The next morning Archer scoured the town in vain for more yellow roses . In consequence of this search he arrived late at the office , perceived that his doing so made no difference whatever to any one , and was filled with sudden exasperation at the elaborate futility of his life . Why should he not be , at that moment , on the sands of St. Augustine with May Welland ? No one was deceived by his pretense of professional activity . In old - fashioned legal firms like that of which Mr. Letterblair was the head , and which were mainly engaged in the management of large estates and "
42007	42176	42440	42440	You	1641	" investments , there were always two or three young men , fairly well - off , and without professional ambition , who , for a certain number of hours of each day , sat at their desks accomplishing trivial tasks , or simply reading the newspapers . Though it was supposed to be proper for them to have an occupation , the crude fact of money - making was still regarded as derogatory , and the law , being a profession , was accounted a more gentlemanly pursuit than business . But none of these young men had much hope of really advancing in his profession , or any earnest desire to do so ; and over many of them the green mould of the perfunctory was already perceptibly spreading . It made Archer shiver to think that it might be spreading over him too . He had , to be sure , other tastes and interests ; he spent his vacations in European travel , cultivated the "

But once he was married , what would become of this narrow margin of life in which his real experiences were lived ? He had seen enough of other young men who had dreamed his dream , though perhaps less ardently , and who had gradually sunk into the placid and luxurious routine of their elders . From the office he sent a note by messenger to Madame Olenska , asking if he might call that afternoon , and begging her to let him find a reply at his club ; but at the club he found nothing , nor did he receive any letter the following day . This unexpected silence mortified him beyond reason , and though the next morning he saw a glorious cluster of yellow roses behind a florist 's window - pane , he left it there . It was only on the third morning that he received a line by post from the Countess Olenska . To his surprise it was dated from Skuytercliff , whither the van der Luydens had promptly retreated after putting the Duke on board his steamer . "

What was Madame Olenska running away from , and why did she feel the need to be safe ? His first thought was of some dark menace from abroad ; then he reflected that he did not know her epistolary style , and that it might run to picturesque exaggeration . Women always exaggerated ; and moreover she was not wholly at her ease in English , which she often spoke as if she were translating from the French . "
42583	42710	42580	42580	me	0	" put in that way , the opening sentence immediately suggested that she might merely have wanted to escape from a boring round of engagements ; which was very likely true , for he judged her to be capricious , and easily wearied of the pleasure of the moment . It amused him to think of the van der Luydens ' having carried her off to Skuytercliff on a second visit , and this time for an indefinite period . The doors of Skuytercliff were rarely and grudgingly opened to visitors , and a chilly week - end was the most ever offered to the few thus privileged . But Archer had seen , on his last visit to Paris , the delicious play of Labiche , "
42717	43024	42580	42580	me	0	" and he remembered M. Perrichon 's dogged and undiscouraged attachment to the young man whom he had pulled out of the glacier . The van der Luydens had rescued Madame Olenska from a doom almost as icy ; and though there were many other reasons for being attracted to her , Archer knew that beneath them all lay the gentle and obstinate determination to go on rescuing her . He felt a distinct disappointment on learning that she was away ; and almost immediately remembered that , only the day before , he had refused an invitation to spend the following Sunday with the Reggie Chiverses at their house on the Hudson , a few miles below Skuytercliff . He had had his fill long ago of the noisy friendly parties at Highbank , with coasting , ice - boating , sleighing , long tramps in the snow , and a general flavour of mild flirting and milder practical jokes . He had just received a box of new books from his London book - seller , and had preferred the prospect of a quiet Sunday at home with his spoils . But he now went into the club writing - room , wrote a hurried telegram , and told the servant to send it immediately . He knew that Mrs. Reggie did n't object to her visitors ' suddenly changing their minds , and that there was always a room to spare in her elastic house . XV . Newland Archer arrived at the Chiverses ' on Friday evening , and on Saturday went conscientiously through all the rites appertaining to a week - end at Highbank . In the morning he had a spin in the ice - boat with his hostess and a few of the hardier guests ; in the afternoon he "
43029	43214	43538	43538	him	304	" with Reggie , and listened , in the elaborately appointed stables , to long and impressive disquisitions on the horse ; after tea he talked in a corner of the firelit hall with a young lady who had professed herself broken - hearted when his engagement was announced , but was now eager to tell him of her own matrimonial hopes ; and finally , about midnight , he assisted in putting a gold - fish in one visitor 's bed , dressed up a burglar in the bath - room of a nervous aunt , and saw in the small hours by joining in a pillow - fight that ranged from the nurseries to the basement . But on Sunday after luncheon he borrowed a cutter , and drove over to Skuytercliff . People had always been told that the house at Skuytercliff was an Italian villa . Those who had never been to Italy believed it ; so did some who had . The house had been built by Mr. van der Luyden in his youth , on his return from the "
43218	43312	43538	43538	him	304	" and in anticipation of his approaching marriage with Miss Louisa Dagonet . It was a large square wooden structure , with tongued and grooved walls painted pale green and white , a Corinthian portico , and fluted pilasters between the windows . From the high ground on which it stood a series of terraces bordered by balustrades and urns descended in the steel - engraving style to a small irregular lake with an asphalt edge overhung by rare weeping conifers . To the right and left , the famous weedless lawns studded with "
43314	43500	43501	43504	Mr. van der Luyden	304	" trees ( each of a different variety ) rolled away to long ranges of grass crested with elaborate cast - iron ornaments ; and below , in a hollow , lay the four - roomed stone house which the first Patroon had built on the land granted him in 1612 . Against the uniform sheet of snow and the greyish winter sky the Italian villa loomed up rather grimly ; even in summer it kept its distance , and the boldest coleus bed had never ventured nearer than thirty feet from its awful front . Now , as Archer rang the bell , the long tinkle seemed to echo through a mausoleum ; and the surprise of the butler who at length responded to the call was as great as though he had been summoned from his final sleep . Happily Archer was of the family , and therefore , irregular though his arrival was , entitled to be informed that the Countess Olenska was out , having driven to afternoon service with Mrs. van der Luyden exactly three quarters of an hour earlier . "
43506	43511	43515	43515	sir	3197	" the butler continued , "
43578	43716	43538	43538	him	304	" But Archer , thanking him , said that he would go and meet the ladies ; and the butler , obviously relieved , closed the door on him majestically . A groom took the cutter to the stables , and Archer struck through the park to the high - road . The village of Skuytercliff was only a mile and a half away , but he knew that Mrs. van der Luyden never walked , and that he must keep to the road to meet the carriage . Presently , however , coming down a foot - path that crossed the highway , he caught sight of a slight figure in a red cloak , with a big dog running ahead . He hurried forward , and Madame Olenska stopped short with a smile of welcome . "
43723	43765	43538	43538	him	304	" she said , and drew her hand from her muff . The red cloak made her look gay and vivid , like the Ellen Mingott of old days ; and he laughed as he took her hand , and answered : "
43777	43787	43766	43766	I	0	" Her face clouded over , but she answered : "
43798	43804	43792	43792	you	1650	" The answer puzzled him . "
43816	43837	43808	43808	you	1651	" She shrugged her shoulders , with a little movement like Nastasia 's , and rejoined in a lighter tone : "
43865	43881	43882	43882	Ellen	260	" The blood rose to his temples and he caught a fold of her cloak . "

43914	43991	43906	43906	my	0	" she cried ; and gathering up the cloak she fled away across the snow , the dog leaping about her with challenging barks . For a moment Archer stood watching , his gaze delighted by the flash of the red meteor against the snow ; then he started after her , and they met , panting and laughing , at a wicket that led into the park . She looked up at him and smiled . "

44007	44051	43992	43992	I	0	" he returned , with a disproportionate joy in their nonsense . The white glitter of the trees filled the air with its own mysterious brightness , and as they walked on over the snow the ground seemed to sing under their feet . "

44188	44214	44181	44181	I	0	" she retorted petulantly . The answer smote him like a blow , and he stood still in the path , looking down at her . "

44235	44250	44251	44251	Ellen	260	" She laid her hand lightly on his arm , and he pleaded earnestly : "

44276	44297	44298	44298	I	0	" He was silent , and they walked on a few yards without exchanging a word . Finally she said : "
44405	44406	44397	44400	a dreadfully polite audience	1664	" "
44415	44467	44409	44409	you	1655	" Archer exclaimed . They were walking past the house of the old Patroon , with its squat walls and small square windows compactly grouped about a central chimney . The shutters stood wide , and through one of the newly - washed windows Archer caught the light of a fire . "
44475	44483	44500	44503	Mr. van der Luyden	304	" he said . She stood still . "
44528	44539	44500	44503	Mr. van der Luyden	304	" She ran up the steps and tried the door . "
44585	44719	44720	44720	You	1670	" He followed her into the narrow passage . His spirits , which had dropped at her last words , rose with an irrational leap . The homely little house stood there , its panels and brasses shining in the firelight , as if magically created to receive them . A big bed of embers still gleamed in the kitchen chimney , under an iron pot hung from an ancient crane . Rush - bottomed arm - chairs faced each other across the tiled hearth , and rows of Delft plates stood on shelves against the walls . Archer stooped over and threw a log upon the embers . Madame Olenska , dropping her cloak , sat down in one of the chairs . Archer leaned against the chimney and looked at her . "
44734	44738	44727	44727	you	1670	" he said . "
44741	44745	44727	44727	you	1670	" She paused . "
44757	44758	44747	44747	I	0	" "
44765	44784	44759	44759	I	0	" he rejoined , his lips stiffening with the effort to say just so much and no more . "
44805	44915	44916	44916	Ellen	260	" The words stole through him like a temptation , and to close his senses to it he moved away from the hearth and stood gazing out at the black tree - boles against the snow . But it was as if she too had shifted her place , and he still saw her , between himself and the trees , drooping over the fire with her indolent smile . Archer 's heart was beating insubordinately . What if it were from him that she had been running away , and if she had waited to tell him so till they were here alone together in this secret room ? "
44952	45087	44942	44942	me	0	" he insisted . He spoke without shifting his position , without even turning to look at her : if the thing was to happen , it was to happen in this way , with the whole width of the room between them , and his eyes still fixed on the outer snow . For a long moment she was silent ; and in that moment Archer imagined her , almost heard her , stealing up behind him to throw her light arms about his neck . While he waited , soul and body throbbing with the miracle to come , his eyes mechanically received the image of a heavily - coated man with his fur collar turned up who was advancing along the path to the house . The man was Julius Beaufort . "
45090	45131	44942	44942	me	0	" Archer cried , bursting into a laugh . Madame Olenska had sprung up and moved to his side , slipping her hand into his ; but after a glance through the window her face paled and she shrank back . "
45137	45142	44942	44942	me	0	" Archer said derisively . "
45151	45185	45143	45143	I	0	" Madame Olenska murmured . Her hand still clung to Archer 's ; but he drew away from her , and walking out into the passage threw open the door of the house . "
45199	45413	45193	45194	Madame Olenska	240	" he said . During his journey back to New York the next morning , Archer relived with a fatiguing vividness his last moments at Skuytercliff . Beaufort , though clearly annoyed at finding him with Madame Olenska , had , as usual , carried off the situation high - handedly . His way of ignoring people whose presence inconvenienced him actually gave them , if they were sensitive to it , a feeling of invisibility , of nonexistence . Archer , as the three strolled back through the park , was aware of this odd sense of disembodiment ; and humbling as it was to his vanity it gave him the ghostly advantage of observing unobserved . Beaufort had entered the little house with his usual easy assurance ; but he could not smile away the vertical line between his eyes . It was fairly clear that Madame Olenska had not known that he was coming , though her words to Archer had hinted at the possibility ; at any rate , she had evidently not told him where she was going when she left New York , and her unexplained departure had exasperated him . The ostensible reason of his appearance was the discovery , the very night before , of a "
45418	45471	45193	45194	Madame Olenska	240	" not in the market , which was really just the thing for her , but would be snapped up instantly if she did n't take it ; and he was loud in mock - reproaches for the dance she had led him in running away just as he had found it . "
45521	46025	45193	45194	Madame Olenska	240	" he grumbled , disguising a real irritation under the pretence of it ; and at this opening Madame Olenska twisted the talk away to the fantastic possibility that they might one day actually converse with each other from street to street , or even -- incredible dream!--from one town to another . This struck from all three allusions to Edgar Poe and Jules Verne , and such platitudes as naturally rise to the lips of the most intelligent when they are talking against time , and dealing with a new invention in which it would seem ingenuous to believe too soon ; and the question of the telephone carried them safely back to the big house . Mrs. van der Luyden had not yet returned ; and Archer took his leave and walked off to fetch the cutter , while Beaufort followed the Countess Olenska indoors . It was probable that , little as the van der Luydens encouraged unannounced visits , he could count on being asked to dine , and sent back to the station to catch the nine o'clock train ; but more than that he would certainly not get , for it would be inconceivable to his hosts that a gentleman travelling without luggage should wish to spend the night , and distasteful to them to propose it to a person with whom they were on terms of such limited cordiality as Beaufort . Beaufort knew all this , and must have foreseen it ; and his taking the long journey for so small a reward gave the measure of his impatience . He was undeniably in pursuit of the Countess Olenska ; and Beaufort had only one object in view in his pursuit of pretty women . His dull and childless home had long since palled on him ; and in addition to more permanent consolations he was always in quest of amorous adventures in his own set . This was the man from whom Madame Olenska was avowedly flying : the question was whether she had fled because his importunities displeased her , or because she did not wholly trust herself to resist them ; unless , indeed , all her talk of flight had been a blind , and her departure no more than a manoeuvre . Archer did not really believe this . Little as he had actually seen of Madame Olenska , he was beginning to think that he could read her face , and if not her face , her voice ; and both had betrayed annoyance , and even dismay , at Beaufort 's sudden appearance . But , after all , if this were the case , was it not worse than if she had left New York for the express purpose of meeting him ? If she had done that , she ceased to be an object of interest , she threw in her lot with the vulgarest of dissemblers : a woman engaged in a love affair with Beaufort "
46027	46416	45193	45194	Madame Olenska	240	" herself irretrievably . No , it was worse a thousand times if , judging Beaufort , and probably despising him , she was yet drawn to him by all that gave him an advantage over the other men about her : his habit of two continents and two societies , his familiar association with artists and actors and people generally in the world 's eye , and his careless contempt for local prejudices . Beaufort was vulgar , he was uneducated , he was purse - proud ; but the circumstances of his life , and a certain native shrewdness , made him better worth talking to than many men , morally and socially his betters , whose horizon was bounded by the Battery and the Central Park . How should any one coming from a wider world not feel the difference and be attracted by it ? Madame Olenska , in a burst of irritation , had said to Archer that he and she did not talk the same language ; and the young man knew that in some respects this was true . But Beaufort understood every turn of her dialect , and spoke it fluently : his view of life , his tone , his attitude , were merely a coarser reflection of those revealed in Count Olenski 's letter . This might seem to be to his disadvantage with Count Olenski 's wife ; but Archer was too intelligent to think that a young woman like Ellen Olenska would necessarily recoil from everything that reminded her of her past . She might believe herself wholly in revolt against it ; but what had charmed her in it would still charm her , even though it were against her will . Thus , with a painful impartiality , did the young man make out the case for Beaufort , and for Beaufort 's victim . A longing to enlighten her was strong in him ; and there were moments when he imagined that all she asked was to be enlightened . That evening he unpacked his books from London . The box was full of things he had been waiting for impatiently ; a new volume of Herbert Spencer , another collection of the prolific Alphonse Daudet 's brilliant tales , and a novel called "
46419	46505	45193	45194	Madame Olenska	240	" as to which there had lately been interesting things said in the reviews . He had declined three dinner invitations in favour of this feast ; but though he turned the pages with the sensuous joy of the book - lover , he did not know what he was reading , and one book after another dropped from his hand . Suddenly , among them , he lit on a small volume of verse which he had ordered because the name had attracted him : "
46511	46644	46645	46645	Mercy	348	" He took it up , and found himself plunged in an atmosphere unlike any he had ever breathed in books ; so warm , so rich , and yet so ineffably tender , that it gave a new and haunting beauty to the most elementary of human passions . All through the night he pursued through those enchanted pages the vision of a woman who had the face of Ellen Olenska ; but when he woke the next morning , and looked out at the brownstone houses across the street , and thought of his desk in Mr. Letterblair 's office , and the family pew in Grace Church , his hour in the park of Skuytercliff became as far outside the pale of probability as the visions of the night . "
46654	46670	46652	46652	Newland	214	" Janey commented over the coffee - cups at breakfast ; and his mother added : "
46696	46835	46685	46685	I	0	" For it was the conviction of both ladies that , under the iron despotism of his senior partners , the young man 's life was spent in the most exhausting professional labours -- and he had never thought it necessary to undeceive them . The next two or three days dragged by heavily . The taste of the usual was like cinders in his mouth , and there were moments when he felt as if he were being buried alive under his future . He heard nothing of the Countess Olenska , or of the perfect little house , and though he met Beaufort at the club they merely nodded at each other across the whist - tables . It was not till the fourth evening that he found a note awaiting him on his return home . "
46848	46881	46840	46840	I	0	" These were the only words it contained . The young man , who was dining out , thrust the note into his pocket , smiling a little at the Frenchness of the "
46885	47095	46840	46840	I	0	" After dinner he went to a play ; and it was not until his return home , after midnight , that he drew Madame Olenska 's missive out again and re - read it slowly a number of times . There were several ways of answering it , and he gave considerable thought to each one during the watches of an agitated night . That on which , when morning came , he finally decided was to pitch some clothes into a portmanteau and jump on board a boat that was leaving that very afternoon for St. Augustine . XVI . When Archer walked down the sandy main street of St. Augustine to the house which had been pointed out to him as Mr. Welland 's , and saw May Welland standing under a magnolia with the sun in her hair , he wondered why he had waited so long to come . Here was the truth , here was reality , here was the life that belonged to him ; and he , who fancied himself so scornful of arbitrary restraints , had been afraid to break away from his desk because of what people might think of his stealing a holiday ! Her first exclamation was : "
47102	47114	46840	46840	I	0	" and it occurred to him that it would have been more "
47116	47135	47138	47138	I	0	" if she had instantly read in his eyes why he had come . But when he answered : "
47146	47430	47138	47138	I	0	" her happy blushes took the chill from her surprise , and he saw how easily he would be forgiven , and how soon even Mr. Letterblair 's mild disapproval would be smiled away by a tolerant family . Early as it was , the main street was no place for any but formal greetings , and Archer longed to be alone with May , and to pour out all his tenderness and his impatience . It still lacked an hour to the late Welland breakfast - time , and instead of asking him to come in she proposed that they should walk out to an old orange - garden beyond the town . She had just been for a row on the river , and the sun that netted the little waves with gold seemed to have caught her in its meshes . Across the warm brown of her cheek her blown hair glittered like silver wire ; and her eyes too looked lighter , almost pale in their youthful limpidity . As she walked beside Archer with her long swinging gait her face wore the vacant serenity of a young marble athlete . To Archer 's strained nerves the vision was as soothing as the sight of the blue sky and the lazy river . They sat down on a bench under the orange - trees and he put his arm about her and kissed her . It was like drinking at a cold spring with the sun on it ; but his pressure may have been more vehement than he had intended , for the blood rose to her face and she drew back as if he had startled her . "
47435	47452	47138	47138	I	0	" he asked , smiling ; and she looked at him with surprise , and answered : "
47455	47511	47138	47138	I	0	" A slight embarrassment fell on them , and her hand slipped out of his . It was the only time that he had kissed her on the lips except for their fugitive embrace in the Beaufort conservatory , and he saw that she was disturbed , and shaken out of her cool boyish composure . "
47520	47704	47138	47138	I	0	" he said , crossing his arms under his tilted - back head , and pushing his hat forward to screen the sun - dazzle . To let her talk about familiar and simple things was the easiest way of carrying on his own independent train of thought ; and he sat listening to her simple chronicle of swimming , sailing and riding , varied by an occasional dance at the primitive inn when a man - of - war came in . A few pleasant people from Philadelphia and Baltimore were picknicking at the inn , and the Selfridge Merrys had come down for three weeks because Kate Merry had had bronchitis . They were planning to lay out a lawn tennis court on the sands ; but no one but Kate and May had racquets , and most of the people had not even heard of the game . All this kept her very busy , and she had not had time to do more than look at the little vellum book that Archer had sent her the week before ( the "
47709	47718	47720	47720	they	1682	" ) ; but she was learning by heart "
47730	47873	47720	47720	they	1682	" because it was one of the first things he had ever read to her ; and it amused her to be able to tell him that Kate Merry had never even heard of a poet called Robert Browning . Presently she started up , exclaiming that they would be late for breakfast ; and they hurried back to the tumble - down house with its pointless porch and unpruned hedge of plumbago and pink geraniums where the Wellands were installed for the winter . Mr. Welland 's sensitive domesticity shrank from the discomforts of the slovenly southern hotel , and at immense expense , and in face of almost insuperable difficulties , Mrs. Welland was obliged , year after year , to improvise an establishment partly made up of discontented New York servants and partly drawn from the local African supply . "
47905	47943	47944	47944	You	1686	" she explained , winter after winter , to the sympathising Philadelphians and Baltimoreans ; and Mr. Welland , beaming across a breakfast table miraculously supplied with the most varied delicacies , was presently saying to Archer : "

"
48045	48066	48034	48034	You	1686	" he said , heaping his plate with straw - coloured griddle - cakes and drowning them in golden syrup . "

48148	48247	48140	48140	he	1694	" said Mrs. Welland indulgently ; and the young man laughed , and said he supposed there was such a thing as one 's profession . He managed , however , after an exchange of telegrams with the firm , to make his cold last a week ; and it shed an ironic light on the situation to know that Mr. Letterblair 's indulgence was partly due to the satisfactory way in which his brilliant young junior partner had settled the troublesome matter of the Olenski divorce . Mr. Letterblair had let Mrs. Welland know that Mr. Archer had "
48252	48308	48309	48309	I	0	" to the whole family , and that old Mrs. Manson Mingott had been particularly pleased ; and one day when May had gone for a drive with her father in the only vehicle the place produced Mrs. Welland took occasion to touch on a topic which she always avoided in her daughter 's presence .

48419	48454	48406	48406	she	232	" It was the first time that the young man had pronounced her name since he had left Skuytercliff , and he felt the colour rise to his cheek . Mrs. Welland smiled compassionately . "
48515	48528	48505	48505	they	751	" Archer made no comment on this , and Mrs. Welland continued : "

48655	48770	48645	48645	you	1701	" He wondered what Mrs. Welland would have said if he had uttered the words instead of merely thinking them . He could picture the sudden decomposure of her firm placid features , to which a lifelong mastery over trifles had given an air of factitious authority . Traces still lingered on them of a fresh beauty like her daughter 's ; and he asked himself if May 's face was doomed to thicken into the same middle - aged image of invincible innocence . Ah , no , he did not want May to have that kind of innocence , the innocence that seals the mind against imagination and the heart against experience ! "

He had meant to seize the opportunity of his private talk with Mrs. Welland to urge her to advance the date of his marriage . But he could think of no arguments that would move her , and with a sense of relief he saw Mr. Welland and May driving up to the door . His only hope was to plead again with May , and on the day before his departure he walked with her to the ruinous garden of the Spanish Mission . The background lent itself to allusions to European scenes ; and May , who was looking her loveliest under a wide - brimmed hat that cast a shadow of mystery over her too - clear eyes , kindled into eagerness as he spoke of Granada and the Alhambra . "

49580	49596	49575	49575	Dear	3127	" he recovered himself to exclaim . She met his protest with a faint smile . "
49611	49628	49575	49575	Dear	3127	" She paused , and added , lifting her head with one of her noble movements : "
49653	49674	49644	49644	You	214	" He lowered his head , staring at the black leaf - pattern on the sunny path at their feet . "

49757	49800	49698	49698	I	0	" Her quiet lucidity startled him , but did not mislead him into thinking her insensible . Under her hat - brim he saw the pallor of her profile , and a slight tremor of the nostril above her resolutely steadied lips . "
49803	49838	49698	49698	I	0	" he questioned , sitting down on the bench , and looking up at her with a frown that he tried to make playful . She dropped back into her seat and went on : "
49953	49998	49943	49943	I	0	" Her voice had sunk almost to a whisper , and she sat clasping and unclasping her hands about the handle of her sunshade . The young man laid his upon them with a gentle pressure ; his heart dilated with an inexpressible relief . "

There was something superhuman in an attitude so recklessly unorthodox , and if other problems had not pressed on him he would have been lost in wonder at the prodigy of the Wellands ' daughter urging him to marry his former mistress . But he was still dizzy with the glimpse of the precipice they had skirted , and full of a new awe at the mystery of young - girlhood . For a moment he could not speak ; then he said : "
50455	50481	50445	50445	I	0	" He pulled himself up , startled by the turn his thoughts had taken , and went on , looking at her with a smile : "
50540	50721	50722	50723	Your cousin	3118	" She flushed with joy and lifted her face to his ; as he bent to it he saw that her eyes were full of happy tears . But in another moment she seemed to have descended from her womanly eminence to helpless and timorous girlhood ; and he understood that her courage and initiative were all for others , and that she had none for herself . It was evident that the effort of speaking had been much greater than her studied composure betrayed , and that at his first word of reassurance she had dropped back into the usual , as a too - adventurous child takes refuge in its mother 's arms . Archer had no heart to go on pleading with her ; he was too much disappointed at the vanishing of the new being who had cast that one deep look at him from her transparent eyes . May seemed to be aware of his disappointment , but without knowing how to alleviate it ; and they stood up and walked silently home . XVII . "

The young man , who was dining alone with his mother and sister , glanced up in surprise and saw Mrs. Archer 's gaze demurely bent on her plate . Mrs. Archer did not regard her seclusion from the world as a reason for being forgotten by it ; and Newland guessed that she was slightly annoyed that he should be surprised by Madame Olenska 's visit .

52216	52308	52196	52196	I	0	" on a Sunday evening it could , of course , be only to Mrs. Lemuel Struthers 's . He felt a slight movement of annoyance , not so much at her going there ( for he rather liked her going where she pleased in spite of the van der Luydens ) , but because it was the kind of house at which she was sure to meet Beaufort , where she must have known beforehand that she would meet him -- and where she was probably going for that purpose . "
52315	52549	52196	52196	I	0	" he repeated , inwardly resolved that he would not go early , and that by reaching her door late he would either prevent her from going to Mrs. Struthers 's , or else arrive after she had started -- which , all things considered , would no doubt be the simplest solution . It was only half - past eight , after all , when he rang the bell under the wisteria ; not as late as he had intended by half an hour -- but a singular restlessness had driven him to her door . He reflected , however , that Mrs. Struthers 's Sunday evenings were not like a ball , and that her guests , as if to minimise their delinquency , usually went early . The one thing he had not counted on , in entering Madame Olenska 's hall , was to find hats and overcoats there . Why had she bidden him to come early if she was having people to dine ? On a closer inspection of the garments besides which Nastasia was laying his own , his resentment gave way to curiosity . The overcoats were in fact the very strangest he had ever seen under a polite roof ; and it took but a glance to assure himself that neither of them belonged to Julius Beaufort . One was a shaggy yellow ulster of "
52555	52577	52578	52578	Macfarlane	411	" cut , the other a very old and rusty cloak with a cape -- something like what the French called a "

On it lay a ragged grey scarf and an odd felt hat of semiclerical shape . Archer raised his eyebrows enquiringly at Nastasia , who raised hers in return with a fatalistic "
52661	52853	52659	52659	Gia	412	" as she threw open the drawing - room door . The young man saw at once that his hostess was not in the room ; then , with surprise , he discovered another lady standing by the fire . This lady , who was long , lean and loosely put together , was clad in raiment intricately looped and fringed , with plaids and stripes and bands of plain colour disposed in a design to which the clue seemed missing . Her hair , which had tried to turn white and only succeeded in fading , was surmounted by a Spanish comb and black lace scarf , and silk mittens , visibly darned , covered her rheumatic hands . Beside her , in a cloud of cigar - smoke , stood the owners of the two overcoats , both in morning clothes that they had evidently not taken off since morning . In one of the two , Archer , to his surprise , recognised Ned Winsett ; the other and older , who was unknown to him , and whose gigantic frame declared him to be the wearer of the "

These three persons stood together on the hearth - rug , their eyes fixed on an extraordinarily large bouquet of crimson roses , with a knot of purple pansies at their base , that lay on the sofa where Madame Olenska usually sat . "

He would have laughed if any one had foretold to him that his first sight of poor Medora Manson would have been in the guise of a messenger of Satan ; but he was in no mood for laughing now , and she seemed to him to come straight out of the hell from which Ellen Olenska had just escaped .

Her bosom was rising high under its lace , and for a moment Archer thought she was about to cry ; but she burst into a laugh instead , and looking from the Marchioness to Archer , asked abruptly : "

55314	55397	55310	55312	my dear one	1856	" and send her out on an errand wrapped in her own opera - cloak ; and Archer , through all his deeper feelings , tasted the pleasurable excitement of being in a world where action followed on emotion with such Olympian speed . Madame Olenska did not move when he came up behind her , and for a second their eyes met in the mirror ; then she turned , threw herself into her sofa - corner , and sighed out : "
55405	55437	55310	55312	my dear one	1856	" He handed her the box and lit a spill for her ; and as the flame flashed up into her face she glanced at him with laughing eyes and said : "

After all , she had perhaps purposely deflected the conversation from her own affairs , and after the pain his last words had evidently caused her he felt that all he could do was to follow her lead . But the sense of the waning hour made him desperate : he could not bear the thought that a barrier of words should drop between them again . "

She started up , and freeing herself from him moved away to the other side of the hearth . "

It seemed to Archer to be crushing him down like his own grave - stone ; in all the wide future he saw nothing that would ever lift that load from his heart . He did not move from his place , or raise his head from his hands ; his hidden eyeballs went on staring into utter darkness . "
57404	57450	57451	57451	Ellen	232	" he brought out . On the other side of the hearth , from the sofa - corner where he supposed that she still crouched , he heard a faint stifled crying like a child 's . He started up and came to her side . "

The one thing that astonished him now was that he should have stood for five minutes arguing with her across the width of the room , when just touching her made everything so simple . She gave him back all his kiss , but after a moment he felt her stiffening in his arms , and she put him aside and stood up . "

He sat bowed over , his head between his hands , staring at the hearthrug , and at the tip of the satin shoe that showed under her dress . Suddenly he knelt down and kissed the shoe . She bent over him , laying her hands on his shoulders , and looking at him with eyes so deep that he remained motionless under her gaze . "

58383	58446	58378	58378	he	1919	" As the words sprang out he was prepared for an answering flare of anger ; and he would have welcomed it as fuel for his own . But Madame Olenska only grew a shade paler , and stood with her arms hanging down before her , and her head slightly bent , as her way was when she pondered a question . "

58605	58625	58626	58626	I	0	" Her tone and her look still enveloped her in a soft inaccessibility , and Archer groaned out again : "

58707	58821	58696	58696	you	1918	" she said . He turned away with a sense of utter weariness . He felt as though he had been struggling for hours up the face of a steep precipice , and now , just as he had fought his way to the top , his hold had given way and he was pitching down headlong into darkness . If he could have got her in his arms again he might have swept away her arguments ; but she still held him at a distance by something inscrutably aloof in her look and attitude , and by his own awed sense of her sincerity . At length he began to plead again . "

58845	58924	58696	58696	you	1918	" she almost screamed , as if he frightened her . At that moment the bell sent a long tinkle through the house . They had heard no carriage stopping at the door , and they stood motionless , looking at each other with startled eyes . Outside , Nastasia 's step crossed the hall , the outer door opened , and a moment later she came in carrying a telegram which she handed to the Countess Olenska . "
58934	58942	58925	58926	The lady	681	" Nastasia said , smoothing her apron . "
58967	59023	58956	58956	she	681	" Her mistress smiled and took the yellow envelope . She tore it open and carried it to the lamp ; then , when the door had closed again , she handed the telegram to Archer . It was dated from St. Augustine , and addressed to the Countess Olenska . In it he read : "
59055	59106	59051	59051	Your	1930	" Half an hour later , when Archer unlocked his own front - door , he found a similar envelope on the hall - table on top of his pile of notes and letters . The message inside the envelope was also from May Welland , and ran as follows : "
59127	59239	59125	59125	May	221	" Archer crumpled up the yellow sheet as if the gesture could annihilate the news it contained . Then he pulled out a small pocket - diary and turned over the pages with trembling fingers ; but he did not find what he wanted , and cramming the telegram into his pocket he mounted the stairs . A light was shining through the door of the little hall - room which served Janey as a dressing - room and boudoir , and her brother rapped impatiently on the panel . The door opened , and his sister stood before him in her immemorial purple flannel dressing - gown , with her hair "

59450	59900	59448	59448	Mamma	244	" Book II XIX . The day was fresh , with a lively spring wind full of dust . All the old ladies in both families had got out their faded sables and yellowing ermines , and the smell of camphor from the front pews almost smothered the faint spring scent of the lilies banking the altar . Newland Archer , at a signal from the sexton , had come out of the vestry and placed himself with his best man on the chancel step of Grace Church . The signal meant that the brougham bearing the bride and her father was in sight ; but there was sure to be a considerable interval of adjustment and consultation in the lobby , where the bridesmaids were already hovering like a cluster of Easter blossoms . During this unavoidable lapse of time the bridegroom , in proof of his eagerness , was expected to expose himself alone to the gaze of the assembled company ; and Archer had gone through this formality as resignedly as through all the others which made of a nineteenth century New York wedding a rite that seemed to belong to the dawn of history . Everything was equally easy -- or equally painful , as one chose to put it -- in the path he was committed to tread , and he had obeyed the flurried injunctions of his best man as piously as other bridegrooms had obeyed his own , in the days when he had guided them through the same labyrinth . So far he was reasonably sure of having fulfilled all his obligations . The bridesmaids ' eight bouquets of white lilac and lilies - of - the - valley had been sent in due time , as well as the gold and sapphire sleeve - links of the eight ushers and the best man 's cat's - eye scarf - pin ; Archer had sat up half the night trying to vary the wording of his thanks for the last batch of presents from men friends and ex - lady - loves ; the fees for the Bishop and the Rector were safely in the pocket of his best man ; his own luggage was already at Mrs. Manson Mingott 's , where the wedding - breakfast was to take place , and so were the travelling clothes into which he was to change ; and a private compartment had been engaged in the train that was to carry the young couple to their unknown destination -- concealment of the spot in which the bridal night was to be spent being one of the most sacred taboos of the prehistoric ritual . "
59907	60074	59448	59448	Mamma	244	" whispered young van der Luyden Newland , who was inexperienced in the duties of a best man , and awed by the weight of his responsibility . Archer made the gesture which he had seen so many bridegrooms make : with his ungloved right hand he felt in the pocket of his dark grey waistcoat , and assured himself that the little gold circlet ( engraved inside : Newland to May , April --- , 187- ) was in its place ; then , resuming his former attitude , his tall hat and pearl - grey gloves with black stitchings grasped in his left hand , he stood looking at the door of the church . Overhead , Handel 's March swelled pompously through the imitation stone vaulting , carrying on its waves the faded drift of the many weddings at which , with cheerful indifference , he had stood on the same chancel step watching other brides float up the nave toward other bridegrooms . "
60084	60215	59448	59448	Mamma	244	" he thought , recognising all the same faces in the same boxes ( no , pews ) , and wondering if , when the Last Trump sounded , Mrs. Selfridge Merry would be there with the same towering ostrich feathers in her bonnet , and Mrs. Beaufort with the same diamond earrings and the same smile -- and whether suitable proscenium seats were already prepared for them in another world . After that there was still time to review , one by one , the familiar countenances in the first rows ; the women 's sharp with curiosity and excitement , the men 's sulky with the obligation of having to put on their frock - coats before luncheon , and fight for food at the wedding - breakfast .

60303	60352	60353	60354	Poor Janey	263	" Archer 's eyes lingered a moment on the left - hand pew , where his mother , who had entered the church on Mr. Henry van der Luyden 's arm , sat weeping softly under her Chantilly veil , her hands in her grandmother 's ermine muff . "
60356	60365	60353	60354	Poor Janey	263	" he thought , looking at his sister , "

Beside him sat his wife , all silvery chinchilla and violets ; and on the far side of the ribbon , Lawrence Lefferts 's sleekly brushed head seemed to mount guard over the invisible deity of "
60465	60547	60463	60470	Good Form " who presided at the ceremony	4077	" who presided at the ceremony . Archer wondered how many flaws Lefferts 's keen eyes would discover in the ritual of his divinity ; then he suddenly recalled that he too had once thought such questions important . The things that had filled his days seemed now like a nursery parody of life , or like the wrangles of mediaeval schoolmen over metaphysical terms that nobody had ever understood . A stormy discussion as to whether the wedding presents should be "

60618	60661	60611	60612	the reporters	1941	" Yet there was a time when Archer had had definite and rather aggressive opinions on all such problems , and when everything concerning the manners and customs of his little tribe had seemed to him fraught with world - wide significance . "

60694	60774	60775	60776	The family	551	" breathed the best man excitedly ; but the bridegroom knew better . The cautious opening of the door of the church meant only that Mr. Brown the livery - stable keeper ( gowned in black in his intermittent character of sexton ) was taking a preliminary survey of the scene before marshalling his forces . The door was softly shut again ; then after another interval it swung majestically open , and a murmur ran through the church : "
60778	61114	60775	60776	The family	551	" Mrs. Welland came first , on the arm of her eldest son . Her large pink face was appropriately solemn , and her plum - coloured satin with pale blue side - panels , and blue ostrich plumes in a small satin bonnet , met with general approval ; but before she had settled herself with a stately rustle in the pew opposite Mrs. Archer 's the spectators were craning their necks to see who was coming after her . Wild rumours had been abroad the day before to the effect that Mrs. Manson Mingott , in spite of her physical disabilities , had resolved on being present at the ceremony ; and the idea was so much in keeping with her sporting character that bets ran high at the clubs as to her being able to walk up the nave and squeeze into a seat . It was known that she had insisted on sending her own carpenter to look into the possibility of taking down the end panel of the front pew , and to measure the space between the seat and the front ; but the result had been discouraging , and for one anxious day her family had watched her dallying with the plan of being wheeled up the nave in her enormous Bath chair and sitting enthroned in it at the foot of the chancel . The idea of this monstrous exposure of her person was so painful to her relations that they could have covered with gold the ingenious person who suddenly discovered that the chair was too wide to pass between the iron uprights of the awning which extended from the church door to the curbstone . The idea of doing away with this awning , and revealing the bride to the mob of dressmakers and newspaper reporters who stood outside fighting to get near the joints of the canvas , exceeded even old Catherine 's courage , though for a moment she had weighed the possibility . "
61132	61574	61117	61117	they	1945	" Mrs. Welland exclaimed when her mother 's last plan was hinted to her ; and from this unthinkable indecency the clan recoiled with a collective shudder . The ancestress had had to give in ; but her concession was bought only by the promise that the wedding - breakfast should take place under her roof , though ( as the Washington Square connection said ) with the Wellands ' house in easy reach it was hard to have to make a special price with Brown to drive one to the other end of nowhere . Though all these transactions had been widely reported by the Jacksons a sporting minority still clung to the belief that old Catherine would appear in church , and there was a distinct lowering of the temperature when she was found to have been replaced by her daughter - in - law . Mrs. Lovell Mingott had the high colour and glassy stare induced in ladies of her age and habit by the effort of getting into a new dress ; but once the disappointment occasioned by her mother - in - law 's non - appearance had subsided , it was agreed that her black Chantilly over lilac satin , with a bonnet of Parma violets , formed the happiest contrast to Mrs. Welland 's blue and plum - colour . Far different was the impression produced by the gaunt and mincing lady who followed on Mr. Mingott 's arm , in a wild dishevelment of stripes and fringes and floating scarves ; and as this last apparition glided into view Archer 's heart contracted and stopped beating . He had taken it for granted that the Marchioness Manson was still in Washington , where she had gone some four weeks previously with her niece , Madame Olenska . It was generally understood that their abrupt departure was due to Madame Olenska 's desire to remove her aunt from the baleful eloquence of Dr. Agathon Carver , who had nearly succeeded in enlisting her as a recruit for the Valley of Love ; and in the circumstances no one had expected either of the ladies to return for the wedding . For a moment Archer stood with his eyes fixed on Medora 's fantastic figure , straining to see who came behind her ; but the little procession was at an end , for all the lesser members of the family had taken their seats , and the eight tall ushers , gathering themselves together like birds or insects preparing for some migratory manoeuvre , were already slipping through the side doors into the lobby . "
61584	61791	61577	61577	I	0	" the best man whispered . Archer roused himself with a start . A long time had apparently passed since his heart had stopped beating , for the white and rosy procession was in fact half way up the nave , the Bishop , the Rector and two white - winged assistants were hovering about the flower - banked altar , and the first chords of the Spohr symphony were strewing their flower - like notes before the bride . Archer opened his eyes ( but could they really have been shut , as he imagined ? ) , and felt his heart beginning to resume its usual task . The music , the scent of the lilies on the altar , the vision of the cloud of tulle and orange - blossoms floating nearer and nearer , the sight of Mrs. Archer 's face suddenly convulsed with happy sobs , the low benedictory murmur of the Rector 's voice , the ordered evolutions of the eight pink bridesmaids and the eight black ushers : all these sights , sounds and sensations , so familiar in themselves , so unutterably strange and meaningless in his new relation to them , were confusedly mingled in his brain . "
61795	61799	61801	61801	I	0	" he thought , "
61804	61852	61801	61801	I	0	ring?"--and once more he went through the bridegroom 's convulsive gesture . Then , in a moment , May was beside him , such radiance streaming from her that it sent a faint warmth through his numbness , and he straightened himself and smiled into her eyes . "
61862	61925	61856	61856	we	1948	" the Rector began ... The ring was on her hand , the Bishop 's benediction had been given , the bridesmaids were a - poise to resume their place in the procession , and the organ was showing preliminary symptoms of breaking out into the Mendelssohn March , without which no newly - wedded couple had ever emerged upon New York . "
61937	62140	62141	62141	Darling	1859	" young Newland nervously hissed ; and once more Archer became aware of having been adrift far off in the unknown . What was it that had sent him there , he wondered ? Perhaps the glimpse , among the anonymous spectators in the transept , of a dark coil of hair under a hat which , a moment later , revealed itself as belonging to an unknown lady with a long nose , so laughably unlike the person whose image she had evoked that he asked himself if he were becoming subject to hallucinations . And now he and his wife were pacing slowly down the nave , carried forward on the light Mendelssohn ripples , the spring day beckoning to them through widely opened doors , and Mrs. Welland 's chestnuts , with big white favours on their frontlets , curvetting and showing off at the far end of the canvas tunnel . The footman , who had a still bigger white favour on his lapel , wrapped May 's white cloak about her , and Archer jumped into the brougham at her side . She turned to him with a triumphant smile and their hands clasped under her veil . "
62143	62177	62141	62141	Darling	1859	" Archer said -- and suddenly the same black abyss yawned before him and he felt himself sinking into it , deeper and deeper , while his voice rambled on smoothly and cheerfully : "
62231	62251	62218	62218	I	0	" She surprised him by turning , in full Fifth Avenue , and flinging her arms about his neck . "
62272	62438	62262	62262	Newland	214	" Every detail of the day had been so carefully thought out that the young couple , after the wedding - breakfast , had ample time to put on their travelling - clothes , descend the wide Mingott stairs between laughing bridesmaids and weeping parents , and get into the brougham under the traditional shower of rice and satin slippers ; and there was still half an hour left in which to drive to the station , buy the last weeklies at the bookstall with the air of seasoned travellers , and settle themselves in the reserved compartment in which May 's maid had already placed her dove - coloured travelling cloak and glaringly new dressing - bag from London . The old du Lac aunts at Rhinebeck had put their house at the disposal of the bridal couple , with a readiness inspired by the prospect of spending a week in New York with Mrs. Archer ; and Archer , glad to escape the usual "
62441	62491	62262	62262	Newland	214	" in a Philadelphia or Baltimore hotel , had accepted with an equal alacrity . May was enchanted at the idea of going to the country , and childishly amused at the vain efforts of the eight bridesmaids to discover where their mysterious retreat was situated . It was thought "
62494	62564	62567	62567	they	1954	" to have a country - house lent to one , and the fact gave a last touch of distinction to what was generally conceded to be the most brilliant wedding of the year ; but where the house was no one was permitted to know , except the parents of bride and groom , who , when taxed with the knowledge , pursed their lips and said mysteriously : "
62572	62737	62567	62567	they	1954	" which was manifestly true , since there was no need to . Once they were settled in their compartment , and the train , shaking off the endless wooden suburbs , had pushed out into the pale landscape of spring , talk became easier than Archer had expected . May was still , in look and tone , the simple girl of yesterday , eager to compare notes with him as to the incidents of the wedding , and discussing them as impartially as a bridesmaid talking it all over with an usher . At first Archer had fancied that this detachment was the disguise of an inward tremor ; but her clear eyes revealed only the most tranquil unawareness . She was alone for the first time with her husband ; but her husband was only the charming comrade of yesterday . There was no one whom she liked as much , no one whom she trusted as completely , and the culminating "
62739	62767	62567	62567	they	1954	" of the whole delightful adventure of engagement and marriage was to be off with him alone on a journey , like a grownup person , like a "
62771	63010	62567	62567	they	1954	" in fact . It was wonderful that -- as he had learned in the Mission garden at St. Augustine -- such depths of feeling could coexist with such absence of imagination . But he remembered how , even then , she had surprised him by dropping back to inexpressive girlishness as soon as her conscience had been eased of its burden ; and he saw that she would probably go through life dealing to the best of her ability with each experience as it came , but never anticipating any by so much as a stolen glance . Perhaps that faculty of unawareness was what gave her eyes their transparency , and her face the look of representing a type rather than a person ; as if she might have been chosen to pose for a Civic Virtue or a Greek goddess . The blood that ran so close to her fair skin might have been a preserving fluid rather than a ravaging element ; yet her look of indestructible youthfulness made her seem neither hard nor dull , but only primitive and pure . In the thick of this meditation Archer suddenly felt himself looking at her with the startled gaze of a stranger , and plunged into a reminiscence of the wedding - breakfast and of Granny Mingott 's immense and triumphant pervasion of it . May settled down to frank enjoyment of the subject . "
63062	63092	63052	63052	you	1957	" He had known that the moment must come sooner or later , but he had somewhat imagined that by force of willing he might hold it at bay . "

63267	63288	63256	63256	they've	275	" Archer exclaimed , as a sedate person out of livery approached them and relieved the maid of her bags . "

63485	63515	63475	63478	Mr. van der Luyden	304	" And as they drove off , with the maid beside the coachman , and their shining bridal bags on the seat before them , she went on excitedly : "

63600	63614	63562	63562	she	232	" cried her husband gaily ; and she answered with her boyish smile : "

63650	63716	63645	63646	Mrs. Carfry	427	" Archer said ; and his wife looked at him with an anxious frown across the monumental Britannia ware of their lodging house breakfast - table . In all the rainy desert of autumnal London there were only two people whom the Newland Archers knew ; and these two they had sedulously avoided , in conformity with the old New York tradition that it was not "
63718	63791	63562	63562	she	232	" to force one 's self on the notice of one 's acquaintances in foreign countries . Mrs. Archer and Janey , in the course of their visits to Europe , had so unflinchingly lived up to this principle , and met the friendly advances of their fellow - travellers with an air of such impenetrable reserve , that they had almost achieved the record of never having exchanged a word with a "
63793	64032	63645	63646	Mrs. Carfry	427	" other than those employed in hotels and railway - stations . Their own compatriots -- save those previously known or properly accredited -- they treated with an even more pronounced disdain ; so that , unless they ran across a Chivers , a Dagonet or a Mingott , their months abroad were spent in an unbroken tete - a - tete . But the utmost precautions are sometimes unavailing ; and one night at Botzen one of the two English ladies in the room across the passage ( whose names , dress and social situation were already intimately known to Janey ) had knocked on the door and asked if Mrs. Archer had a bottle of liniment . The other lady -- the intruder 's sister , Mrs. Carfry -- had been seized with a sudden attack of bronchitis ; and Mrs. Archer , who never travelled without a complete family pharmacy , was fortunately able to produce the required remedy . Mrs. Carfry was very ill , and as she and her sister Miss Harle were travelling alone they were profoundly grateful to the Archer ladies , who supplied them with ingenious comforts and whose efficient maid helped to nurse the invalid back to health . When the Archers left Botzen they had no idea of ever seeing Mrs. Carfry and Miss Harle again . Nothing , to Mrs. Archer 's mind , would have been more "
64034	64046	63645	63646	Mrs. Carfry	427	" than to force one 's self on the notice of a "
64048	64094	63645	63646	Mrs. Carfry	427	" to whom one had happened to render an accidental service . But Mrs. Carfry and her sister , to whom this point of view was unknown , and who would have found it utterly incomprehensible , felt themselves linked by an eternal gratitude to the "
64097	64218	63645	63646	Mrs. Carfry	427	" who had been so kind at Botzen . With touching fidelity they seized every chance of meeting Mrs. Archer and Janey in the course of their continental travels , and displayed a supernatural acuteness in finding out when they were to pass through London on their way to or from the States . The intimacy became indissoluble , and Mrs. Archer and Janey , whenever they alighted at Brown 's Hotel , found themselves awaited by two affectionate friends who , like themselves , cultivated ferns in Wardian cases , made macrame lace , read the memoirs of the Baroness Bunsen and had views about the occupants of the leading London pulpits . As Mrs. Archer said , it made "
64223	64253	64313	64314	Mrs. Carfry	427	" to know Mrs. Carfry and Miss Harle ; and by the time that Newland became engaged the tie between the families was so firmly established that it was thought "
64256	64306	64307	64307	You	1976	" to send a wedding invitation to the two English ladies , who sent , in return , a pretty bouquet of pressed Alpine flowers under glass . And on the dock , when Newland and his wife sailed for England , Mrs. Archer 's last word had been : "

The moist English air seemed to have deepened the bloom of her cheeks and softened the slight hardness of her virginal features ; or else it was simply the inner glow of happiness , shining through like a light under ice .

64792	64823	64744	64744	Worth	432	" The Newland Archers were on their way home , after a three months ' wedding - tour which May , in writing to her girl friends , vaguely summarised as "
64826	64927	64744	64744	Worth	432	" They had not gone to the Italian Lakes : on reflection , Archer had not been able to picture his wife in that particular setting . Her own inclination ( after a month with the Paris dressmakers ) was for mountaineering in July and swimming in August . This plan they punctually fulfilled , spending July at Interlaken and Grindelwald , and August at a little place called Etretat , on the Normandy coast , which some one had recommended as quaint and quiet . Once or twice , in the mountains , Archer had pointed southward and said : "
64931	64951	64744	64744	Worth	432	" ; and May , her feet in a gentian - bed , had smiled cheerfully , and replied : "
64974	65113	64744	64744	Worth	432	" But in reality travelling interested her even less than he had expected . She regarded it ( once her clothes were ordered ) as merely an enlarged opportunity for walking , riding , swimming , and trying her hand at the fascinating new game of lawn tennis ; and when they finally got back to London ( where they were to spend a fortnight while he ordered HIS clothes ) she no longer concealed the eagerness with which she looked forward to sailing . In London nothing interested her but the theatres and the shops ; and she found the theatres less exciting than the Paris cafes chantants where , under the blossoming horse - chestnuts of the Champs Elysees , she had had the novel experience of looking down from the restaurant terrace on an audience of "
65116	65816	64744	64744	Worth	432	" and having her husband interpret to her as much of the songs as he thought suitable for bridal ears . Archer had reverted to all his old inherited ideas about marriage . It was less trouble to conform with the tradition and treat May exactly as all his friends treated their wives than to try to put into practice the theories with which his untrammelled bachelorhood had dallied . There was no use in trying to emancipate a wife who had not the dimmest notion that she was not free ; and he had long since discovered that May 's only use of the liberty she supposed herself to possess would be to lay it on the altar of her wifely adoration . Her innate dignity would always keep her from making the gift abjectly ; and a day might even come ( as it once had ) when she would find strength to take it altogether back if she thought she were doing it for his own good . But with a conception of marriage so uncomplicated and incurious as hers such a crisis could be brought about only by something visibly outrageous in his own conduct ; and the fineness of her feeling for him made that unthinkable . Whatever happened , he knew , she would always be loyal , gallant and unresentful ; and that pledged him to the practice of the same virtues . All this tended to draw him back into his old habits of mind . If her simplicity had been the simplicity of pettiness he would have chafed and rebelled ; but since the lines of her character , though so few , were on the same fine mould as her face , she became the tutelary divinity of all his old traditions and reverences . Such qualities were scarcely of the kind to enliven foreign travel , though they made her so easy and pleasant a companion ; but he saw at once how they would fall into place in their proper setting . He had no fear of being oppressed by them , for his artistic and intellectual life would go on , as it always had , outside the domestic circle ; and within it there would be nothing small and stifling -- coming back to his wife would never be like entering a stuffy room after a tramp in the open . And when they had children the vacant corners in both their lives would be filled . All these things went through his mind during their long slow drive from Mayfair to South Kensington , where Mrs. Carfry and her sister lived . Archer too would have preferred to escape their friends ' hospitality : in conformity with the family tradition he had always travelled as a sight - seer and looker - on , affecting a haughty unconsciousness of the presence of his fellow - beings . Once only , just after Harvard , he had spent a few gay weeks at Florence with a band of queer Europeanised Americans , dancing all night with titled ladies in palaces , and gambling half the day with the rakes and dandies of the fashionable club ; but it had all seemed to him , though the greatest fun in the world , as unreal as a carnival . These queer cosmopolitan women , deep in complicated love - affairs which they appeared to feel the need of retailing to every one they met , and the magnificent young officers and elderly dyed wits who were the subjects or the recipients of their confidences , were too different from the people Archer had grown up among , too much like expensive and rather malodorous hot - house exotics , to detain his imagination long . To introduce his wife into such a society was out of the question ; and in the course of his travels no other had shown any marked eagerness for his company . Not long after their arrival in London he had run across the Duke of St. Austrey , and the Duke , instantly and cordially recognising him , had said : "
65823	65902	64744	64744	Worth	432	you?"--but no proper - spirited American would have considered that a suggestion to be acted on , and the meeting was without a sequel . They had even managed to avoid May 's English aunt , the banker 's wife , who was still in Yorkshire ; in fact , they had purposely postponed going to London till the autumn in order that their arrival during the season might not appear pushing and snobbish to these unknown relatives . "
65929	65967	65921	65921	you	1994	" Archer said to May , who sat at his side in the hansom so spotlessly splendid in her sky - blue cloak edged with swansdown that it seemed wicked to expose her to the London grime . "
65981	66017	66020	66020	their	1995	" she replied , with a scorn that Pocahontas might have resented ; and he was struck again by the religious reverence of even the most unworldly American women for the social advantages of dress . "
66023	66027	66020	66020	their	1995	" he thought , "
66040	66223	66035	66035	their	1995	" And he understood for the first time the earnestness with which May , who was incapable of tying a ribbon in her hair to charm him , had gone through the solemn rite of selecting and ordering her extensive wardrobe . He had been right in expecting the party at Mrs. Carfry 's to be a small one . Besides their hostess and her sister , they found , in the long chilly drawing - room , only another shawled lady , a genial Vicar who was her husband , a silent lad whom Mrs. Carfry named as her nephew , and a small dark gentleman with lively eyes whom she introduced as his tutor , pronouncing a French name as she did so . Into this dimly - lit and dim - featured group May Archer floated like a swan with the sunset on her : she seemed larger , fairer , more voluminously rustling than her husband had ever seen her ; and he perceived that the rosiness and rustlingness were the tokens of an extreme and infantile shyness . "
66235	66877	66228	66228	they	1998	" her helpless eyes implored him , at the very moment that her dazzling apparition was calling forth the same anxiety in their own bosoms . But beauty , even when distrustful of itself , awakens confidence in the manly heart ; and the Vicar and the French - named tutor were soon manifesting to May their desire to put her at her ease . In spite of their best efforts , however , the dinner was a languishing affair . Archer noticed that his wife 's way of showing herself at her ease with foreigners was to become more uncompromisingly local in her references , so that , though her loveliness was an encouragement to admiration , her conversation was a chill to repartee . The Vicar soon abandoned the struggle ; but the tutor , who spoke the most fluent and accomplished English , gallantly continued to pour it out to her until the ladies , to the manifest relief of all concerned , went up to the drawing - room . The Vicar , after a glass of port , was obliged to hurry away to a meeting , and the shy nephew , who appeared to be an invalid , was packed off to bed . But Archer and the tutor continued to sit over their wine , and suddenly Archer found himself talking as he had not done since his last symposium with Ned Winsett . The Carfry nephew , it turned out , had been threatened with consumption , and had had to leave Harrow for Switzerland , where he had spent two years in the milder air of Lake Leman . Being a bookish youth , he had been entrusted to M. Riviere , who had brought him back to England , and was to remain with him till he went up to Oxford the following spring ; and M. Riviere added with simplicity that he should then have to look out for another job . It seemed impossible , Archer thought , that he should be long without one , so varied were his interests and so many his gifts . He was a man of about thirty , with a thin ugly face ( May would certainly have called him common - looking ) to which the play of his ideas gave an intense expressiveness ; but there was nothing frivolous or cheap in his animation . His father , who had died young , had filled a small diplomatic post , and it had been intended that the son should follow the same career ; but an insatiable taste for letters had thrown the young man into journalism , then into authorship ( apparently unsuccessful ) , and at length -- after other experiments and vicissitudes which he spared his listener -- into tutoring English youths in Switzerland . Before that , however , he had lived much in Paris , frequented the Goncourt grenier , been advised by Maupassant not to attempt to write ( even that seemed to Archer a dazzling honour ! ) , and had often talked with Merimee in his mother 's house . He had obviously always been desperately poor and anxious ( having a mother and an unmarried sister to provide for ) , and it was apparent that his literary ambitions had failed . His situation , in fact , seemed , materially speaking , no more brilliant than Ned Winsett 's ; but he had lived in a world in which , as he said , no one who loved ideas need hunger mentally . As it was precisely of that love that poor Winsett was starving to death , Archer looked with a sort of vicarious envy at this eager impecunious young man who had fared so richly in his poverty . "
67044	67058	67023	67023	I	0	" He fixed his vivid eyes on Archer as he lit another cigarette . "

New York , for a young man who had frequented the Goncourts and Flaubert , and who thought the life of ideas the only one worth living ! He continued to stare at M. Riviere perplexedly , wondering how to tell him that his very superiorities and advantages would be the surest hindrance to success . "
67250	67292	67293	67293	I	0	" he stammered , utterly unable to imagine what lucrative opening his native city could offer to a young man to whom good conversation appeared to be the only necessity . A sudden flush rose under M. Riviere 's sallow skin . "
67310	67336	67337	67337	One	519	" he rejoined ; then , as if fearing to give his hearer the impression of having asked a favour , he went on hastily : "
67360	67375	67377	67378	Mrs. Carfry	427	" and rising from his seat he added , without a trace of constraint : "
67390	67449	67377	67378	Mrs. Carfry	427	" During the homeward drive Archer pondered deeply on this episode . His hour with M. Riviere had put new air into his lungs , and his first impulse had been to invite him to dine the next day ; but he was beginning to understand why married men did not always immediately yield to their first impulses . "
67471	67510	67458	67458	we	2024	" he threw out tentatively in the hansom . May roused herself from one of the dreamy silences into which he had read so many meanings before six months of marriage had given him the key to them . "
67521	67623	67517	67517	he	2025	" she questioned coldly ; and he guessed that she nursed a secret disappointment at having been invited out in London to meet a clergyman and a French tutor . The disappointment was not occasioned by the sentiment ordinarily defined as snobbishness , but by old New York 's sense of what was due to it when it risked its dignity in foreign lands . If May 's parents had entertained the Carfrys in Fifth Avenue they would have offered them something more substantial than a parson and a schoolmaster . But Archer was on edge , and took her up . "
67629	67640	67517	67517	he	2025	" he queried ; and she returned with unusual readiness : "

Another after - dinner talk would have made it difficult to avoid the question of New York ; and the more Archer considered it the less he was able to fit M. Riviere into any conceivable picture of New York as he knew it . He perceived with a flash of chilling insight that in future many problems would be thus negatively solved for him ; but as he paid the hansom and followed his wife 's long train into the house he took refuge in the comforting platitude that the first six months were always the most difficult in marriage . "
68105	68712	68090	68090	I	0	" he reflected ; but the worst of it was that May 's pressure was already bearing on the very angles whose sharpness he most wanted to keep . XXI . The small bright lawn stretched away smoothly to the big bright sea . The turf was hemmed with an edge of scarlet geranium and coleus , and cast - iron vases painted in chocolate colour , standing at intervals along the winding path that led to the sea , looped their garlands of petunia and ivy geranium above the neatly raked gravel . Half way between the edge of the cliff and the square wooden house ( which was also chocolate - coloured , but with the tin roof of the verandah striped in yellow and brown to represent an awning ) two large targets had been placed against a background of shrubbery . On the other side of the lawn , facing the targets , was pitched a real tent , with benches and garden - seats about it . A number of ladies in summer dresses and gentlemen in grey frock - coats and tall hats stood on the lawn or sat upon the benches ; and every now and then a slender girl in starched muslin would step from the tent , bow in hand , and speed her shaft at one of the targets , while the spectators interrupted their talk to watch the result . Newland Archer , standing on the verandah of the house , looked curiously down upon this scene . On each side of the shiny painted steps was a large blue china flower - pot on a bright yellow china stand . A spiky green plant filled each pot , and below the verandah ran a wide border of blue hydrangeas edged with more red geraniums . Behind him , the French windows of the drawing - rooms through which he had passed gave glimpses , between swaying lace curtains , of glassy parquet floors islanded with chintz poufs , dwarf armchairs , and velvet tables covered with trifles in silver . The Newport Archery Club always held its August meeting at the Beauforts ' . The sport , which had hitherto known no rival but croquet , was beginning to be discarded in favour of lawn - tennis ; but the latter game was still considered too rough and inelegant for social occasions , and as an opportunity to show off pretty dresses and graceful attitudes the bow and arrow held their own . Archer looked down with wonder at the familiar spectacle . It surprised him that life should be going on in the old way when his own reactions to it had so completely changed . It was Newport that had first brought home to him the extent of the change . In New York , during the previous winter , after he and May had settled down in the new greenish - yellow house with the bow - window and the Pompeian vestibule , he had dropped back with relief into the old routine of the office , and the renewal of this daily activity had served as a link with his former self . Then there had been the pleasurable excitement of choosing a showy grey stepper for May 's brougham ( the Wellands had given the carriage ) , and the abiding occupation and interest of arranging his new library , which , in spite of family doubts and disapprovals , had been carried out as he had dreamed , with a dark embossed paper , Eastlake book - cases and "
68714	68847	68090	68090	I	0	" arm - chairs and tables . At the Century he had found Winsett again , and at the Knickerbocker the fashionable young men of his own set ; and what with the hours dedicated to the law and those given to dining out or entertaining friends at home , with an occasional evening at the Opera or the play , the life he was living had still seemed a fairly real and inevitable sort of business . But Newport represented the escape from duty into an atmosphere of unmitigated holiday - making . Archer had tried to persuade May to spend the summer on a remote island off the coast of Maine ( called , appropriately enough , Mount Desert ) , where a few hardy Bostonians and Philadelphians were camping in "
68849	69450	69451	69452	My dear	3140	" cottages , and whence came reports of enchanting scenery and a wild , almost trapper - like existence amid woods and waters . But the Wellands always went to Newport , where they owned one of the square boxes on the cliffs , and their son - in - law could adduce no good reason why he and May should not join them there . As Mrs. Welland rather tartly pointed out , it was hardly worth while for May to have worn herself out trying on summer clothes in Paris if she was not to be allowed to wear them ; and this argument was of a kind to which Archer had as yet found no answer . May herself could not understand his obscure reluctance to fall in with so reasonable and pleasant a way of spending the summer . She reminded him that he had always liked Newport in his bachelor days , and as this was indisputable he could only profess that he was sure he was going to like it better than ever now that they were to be there together . But as he stood on the Beaufort verandah and looked out on the brightly peopled lawn it came home to him with a shiver that he was not going to like it at all . It was not May 's fault , poor dear . If , now and then , during their travels , they had fallen slightly out of step , harmony had been restored by their return to the conditions she was used to . He had always foreseen that she would not disappoint him ; and he had been right . He had married ( as most young men did ) because he had met a perfectly charming girl at the moment when a series of rather aimless sentimental adventures were ending in premature disgust ; and she had represented peace , stability , comradeship , and the steadying sense of an unescapable duty . He could not say that he had been mistaken in his choice , for she had fulfilled all that he had expected . It was undoubtedly gratifying to be the husband of one of the handsomest and most popular young married women in New York , especially when she was also one of the sweetest - tempered and most reasonable of wives ; and Archer had never been insensible to such advantages . As for the momentary madness which had fallen upon him on the eve of his marriage , he had trained himself to regard it as the last of his discarded experiments . The idea that he could ever , in his senses , have dreamed of marrying the Countess Olenska had become almost unthinkable , and she remained in his memory simply as the most plaintive and poignant of a line of ghosts . But all these abstractions and eliminations made of his mind a rather empty and echoing place , and he supposed that was one of the reasons why the busy animated people on the Beaufort lawn shocked him as if they had been children playing in a grave - yard . He heard a murmur of skirts beside him , and the Marchioness Manson fluttered out of the drawing - room window . As usual , she was extraordinarily festooned and bedizened , with a limp Leghorn hat anchored to her head by many windings of faded gauze , and a little black velvet parasol on a carved ivory handle absurdly balanced over her much larger hatbrim . "

69542	69601	69535	69535	I	0	" Archer 's heart stopped with the queer jerk which it had given once before , and which seemed suddenly to slam a door between himself and the outer world ; but this break of continuity must have been of the briefest , for he presently heard Medora answering a question he had apparently found voice to put . "

Archer , who had not seen him for two or three months , was struck by the change in his appearance . In the hot summer light his floridness seemed heavy and bloated , and but for his erect square - shouldered walk he would have looked like an over - fed and over - dressed old man . There were all sorts of rumours afloat about Beaufort . In the spring he had gone off on a long cruise to the West Indies in his new steam - yacht , and it was reported that , at various points where he had touched , a lady resembling Miss Fanny Ring had been seen in his company . The steam - yacht , built in the Clyde , and fitted with tiled bath - rooms and other unheard - of luxuries , was said to have cost him half a million ; and the pearl necklace which he had presented to his wife on his return was as magnificent as such expiatory offerings are apt to be . Beaufort 's fortune was substantial enough to stand the strain ; and yet the disquieting rumours persisted , not only in Fifth Avenue but in Wall Street . Some people said he had speculated unfortunately in railways , others that he was being bled by one of the most insatiable members of her profession ; and to every report of threatened insolvency Beaufort replied by a fresh extravagance : the building of a new row of orchid - houses , the purchase of a new string of race - horses , or the addition of a new Meissonnier or Cabanel to his picture - gallery . He advanced toward the Marchioness and Newland with his usual half - sneering smile . "
70252	70307	70659	70659	Gad	442	" He shook hands with Archer , and then , turning back with them , placed himself on Mrs. Manson 's other side , and said , in a low voice , a few words which their companion did not catch . The Marchioness replied by one of her queer foreign jerks , and a "
70313	70338	70659	70659	Gad	442	" which deepened Beaufort 's frown ; but he produced a good semblance of a congratulatory smile as he glanced at Archer to say : "

70362	70658	70659	70659	Gad	442	" Medora rippled ; and at that moment they reached the tent and Mrs. Beaufort met them in a girlish cloud of mauve muslin and floating veils . May Welland was just coming out of the tent . In her white dress , with a pale green ribbon about the waist and a wreath of ivy on her hat , she had the same Diana - like aloofness as when she had entered the Beaufort ball - room on the night of her engagement . In the interval not a thought seemed to have passed behind her eyes or a feeling through her heart ; and though her husband knew that she had the capacity for both he marvelled afresh at the way in which experience dropped away from her . She had her bow and arrow in her hand , and placing herself on the chalk - mark traced on the turf she lifted the bow to her shoulder and took aim . The attitude was so full of a classic grace that a murmur of appreciation followed her appearance , and Archer felt the glow of proprietorship that so often cheated him into momentary well - being . Her rivals -- Mrs. Reggie Chivers , the Merry girls , and divers rosy Thorleys , Dagonets and Mingotts , stood behind her in a lovely anxious group , brown heads and golden bent above the scores , and pale muslins and flower - wreathed hats mingled in a tender rainbow . All were young and pretty , and bathed in summer bloom ; but not one had the nymph - like ease of his wife , when , with tense muscles and happy frown , she bent her soul upon some feat of strength . "

70718	70766	70678	70678	she	2057	" was just what a husband should have wished to hear said of his wife . The fact that a coarseminded man found her lacking in attraction was simply another proof of her quality ; yet the words sent a faint shiver through his heart . What if "
70768	70953	70678	70678	she	2057	" carried to that supreme degree were only a negation , the curtain dropped before an emptiness ? As he looked at May , returning flushed and calm from her final bull's - eye , he had the feeling that he had never yet lifted that curtain . She took the congratulations of her rivals and of the rest of the company with the simplicity that was her crowning grace . No one could ever be jealous of her triumphs because she managed to give the feeling that she would have been just as serene if she had missed them . But when her eyes met her husband 's her face glowed with the pleasure she saw in his . Mrs. Welland 's basket - work pony - carriage was waiting for them , and they drove off among the dispersing carriages , May handling the reins and Archer sitting at her side . The afternoon sunlight still lingered upon the bright lawns and shrubberies , and up and down Bellevue Avenue rolled a double line of victorias , dog - carts , landaus and "

71024	71418	71007	71007	her	243	" Archer acquiesced , and she turned the ponies down Narragansett Avenue , crossed Spring Street and drove out toward the rocky moorland beyond . In this unfashionable region Catherine the Great , always indifferent to precedent and thrifty of purse , had built herself in her youth a many - peaked and cross - beamed cottage - orne on a bit of cheap land overlooking the bay . Here , in a thicket of stunted oaks , her verandahs spread themselves above the island - dotted waters . A winding drive led up between iron stags and blue glass balls embedded in mounds of geraniums to a front door of highly - varnished walnut under a striped verandah - roof ; and behind it ran a narrow hall with a black and yellow star - patterned parquet floor , upon which opened four small square rooms with heavy flock - papers under ceilings on which an Italian house - painter had lavished all the divinities of Olympus . One of these rooms had been turned into a bedroom by Mrs. Mingott when the burden of flesh descended on her , and in the adjoining one she spent her days , enthroned in a large armchair between the open door and window , and perpetually waving a palm - leaf fan which the prodigious projection of her bosom kept so far from the rest of her person that the air it set in motion stirred only the fringe of the anti - macassars on the chair - arms . Since she had been the means of hastening his marriage old Catherine had shown to Archer the cordiality which a service rendered excites toward the person served . She was persuaded that irrepressible passion was the cause of his impatience ; and being an ardent admirer of impulsiveness ( when it did not lead to the spending of money ) she always received him with a genial twinkle of complicity and a play of allusion to which May seemed fortunately impervious . She examined and appraised with much interest the diamond - tipped arrow which had been pinned on May 's bosom at the conclusion of the match , remarking that in her day a filigree brooch would have been thought enough , but that there was no denying that Beaufort did things handsomely . "

71694	71760	71692	71692	ELLEN	232	" she cried in her shrill old voice , trying to bend forward far enough to catch a glimpse of the lawn beyond the verandah . There was no answer , and Mrs. Mingott rapped impatiently with her stick on the shiny floor . A mulatto maid - servant in a bright turban , replying to the summons , informed her mistress that she had seen "
71763	71779	71692	71692	ELLEN	232	" going down the path to the shore ; and Mrs. Mingott turned to Archer . "
71801	71889	71791	71793	this pretty lady	2072	" she said ; and Archer stood up as if in a dream . He had heard the Countess Olenska 's name pronounced often enough during the year and a half since they had last met , and was even familiar with the main incidents of her life in the interval . He knew that she had spent the previous summer at Newport , where she appeared to have gone a great deal into society , but that in the autumn she had suddenly sub - let the "
71892	71939	71791	71793	this pretty lady	2072	" which Beaufort had been at such pains to find for her , and decided to establish herself in Washington . There , during the winter , he had heard of her ( as one always heard of pretty women in Washington ) as shining in the "
71943	72371	71791	71793	this pretty lady	2072	" that was supposed to make up for the social short - comings of the Administration . He had listened to these accounts , and to various contradictory reports on her appearance , her conversation , her point of view and her choice of friends , with the detachment with which one listens to reminiscences of some one long since dead ; not till Medora suddenly spoke her name at the archery match had Ellen Olenska become a living presence to him again . The Marchioness 's foolish lisp had called up a vision of the little fire - lit drawing - room and the sound of the carriage - wheels returning down the deserted street . He thought of a story he had read , of some peasant children in Tuscany lighting a bunch of straw in a wayside cavern , and revealing old silent images in their painted tomb ... The way to the shore descended from the bank on which the house was perched to a walk above the water planted with weeping willows . Through their veil Archer caught the glint of the Lime Rock , with its white - washed turret and the tiny house in which the heroic light - house keeper , Ida Lewis , was living her last venerable years . Beyond it lay the flat reaches and ugly government chimneys of Goat Island , the bay spreading northward in a shimmer of gold to Prudence Island with its low growth of oaks , and the shores of Conanicut faint in the sunset haze . From the willow walk projected a slight wooden pier ending in a sort of pagoda - like summer - house ; and in the pagoda a lady stood , leaning against the rail , her back to the shore . Archer stopped at the sight as if he had waked from sleep . That vision of the past was a dream , and the reality was what awaited him in the house on the bank overhead : was Mrs. Welland 's pony - carriage circling around and around the oval at the door , was May sitting under the shameless Olympians and glowing with secret hopes , was the Welland villa at the far end of Bellevue Avenue , and Mr. Welland , already dressed for dinner , and pacing the drawing - room floor , watch in hand , with dyspeptic impatience -- for it was one of the houses in which one always knew exactly what is happening at a given hour . "
72382	72537	72538	72538	She	2074	" Archer thought . The figure at the end of the pier had not moved . For a long moment the young man stood half way down the bank , gazing at the bay furrowed with the coming and going of sailboats , yacht - launches , fishing - craft and the trailing black coal - barges hauled by noisy tugs . The lady in the summer - house seemed to be held by the same sight . Beyond the grey bastions of Fort Adams a long - drawn sunset was splintering up into a thousand fires , and the radiance caught the sail of a catboat as it beat out through the channel between the Lime Rock and the shore . Archer , as he watched , remembered the scene in the Shaughraun , and Montague lifting Ada Dyas 's ribbon to his lips without her knowing that he was in the room . "
72562	72573	72553	72553	she	2074	" he mused ; and suddenly he said to himself : "
72592	72674	72587	72587	I	0	" The boat was gliding out on the receding tide . It slid before the Lime Rock , blotted out Ida Lewis 's little house , and passed across the turret in which the light was hung . Archer waited till a wide space of water sparkled between the last reef of the island and the stern of the boat ; but still the figure in the summer - house did not move . He turned and walked up the hill . "

72864	72880	72881	72881	I	0	" he exclaimed ; and as she turned a puzzled frown on him he added : "

They drove down Bellevue Avenue and turned in between the chamfered wooden gate - posts surmounted by cast - iron lamps which marked the approach to the Welland villa . Lights were already shining through its windows , and Archer , as the carriage stopped , caught a glimpse of his father - in - law , exactly as he had pictured him , pacing the drawing - room , watch in hand and wearing the pained expression that he had long since found to be much more efficacious than anger . The young man , as he followed his wife into the hall , was conscious of a curious reversal of mood . There was something about the luxury of the Welland house and the density of the Welland atmosphere , so charged with minute observances and exactions , that always stole into his system like a narcotic . The heavy carpets , the watchful servants , the perpetually reminding tick of disciplined clocks , the perpetually renewed stack of cards and invitations on the hall table , the whole chain of tyrannical trifles binding one hour to the next , and each member of the household to all the others , made any less systematised and affluent existence seem unreal and precarious . But now it was the Welland house , and the life he was expected to lead in it , that had become unreal and irrelevant , and the brief scene on the shore , when he had stood irresolute , halfway down the bank , was as close to him as the blood in his veins . All night he lay awake in the big chintz bedroom at May 's side , watching the moonlight slant along the carpet , and thinking of Ellen Olenska driving home across the gleaming beaches behind Beaufort 's trotters .

75933	75953	75916	75917	Miss Blenker	456	" The house IS empty . Mother 's not here , or the Marchioness -- or anybody but me . "
75960	76025	76026	76026	she	240	" Did n't you know that Professor and Mrs. Sillerton are giving a garden - party for mother and all of us this afternoon ? It was too unlucky that I could n't go ; but I 've had a sore throat , and mother was afraid of the drive home this evening . Did you ever know anything so disappointing ? Of course , "
76030	76047	76026	76026	she	240	" I should n't have minded half as much if I 'd known you were coming . "
76067	76079	76059	76059	Archer	255	" But Madame Olenska -- has she gone to Newport too ? "
76088	76101	76080	76081	Miss Blenker	456	" Madame Olenska -- didn't you know she 'd been called away ? "
76102	76105	76026	76026	she	240	" Called away?-- "
76106	76149	76157	76157	she	456	" Oh , my best parasol ! I lent it to that goose of a Katie , because it matched her ribbons , and the careless thing must have dropped it here . We Blenkers are all like that ... real Bohemians ! "
76169	76218	76157	76157	she	456	" Yes , Ellen was called away yesterday : she lets us call her Ellen , you know . A telegram came from Boston : she said she might be gone for two days . I do LOVE the way she does her hair , do n't you ? "
76259	76284	76256	76256	he	255	" You do n't happen to know why Madame Olenska went to Boston ? I hope it was not on account of bad news ? "
76294	76362	76285	76286	Miss Blenker	456	" Oh , I do n't believe so . She did n't tell us what was in the telegram . I think she did n't want the Marchioness to know . She 's so romantic - looking , is n't she ? Does n't she remind you of Mrs. Scott - Siddons when she reads ' Lady Geraldine 's Courtship ' ? Did you never hear her ? "
76468	76491	76463	76463	He	255	" You do n't know , I suppose -- I shall be in Boston tomorrow . If I could manage to see her-- "
76508	76536	76504	76504	her	456	" Oh , of course ; how lovely of you ! She 's staying at the Parker House ; it must be horrible there in this weather . "
77108	77116	77120	77121	a waiter	2222	" The lady was out , sir , "
77132	77134	77129	77129	he	255	" Out?-- "
77380	77381	77373	77373	she	2224	" Oh"--she
77414	77415	77425	77425	he	255	" Oh"--she
77445	77456	77457	77457	Archer	430	" I 'm here on business -- just got here , "
77476	77488	77466	77466	he	255	" But what on earth are you doing in this wilderness ? "
77523	77535	77536	77536	she	2224	" I ? Oh , I 'm here on business too , "
77603	77610	77611	77611	he	255	" You do your hair differently , "
77625	77647	77611	77611	he	255	" Differently ? No -- it 's only that I do it as best I can when I 'm without Nastasia . "
77648	77658	77690	77690	She	2224	" Nastasia ; but is n't she with you ? "
77659	77678	77611	77611	he	255	" No ; I 'm alone . For two days it was not worth while to bring her . "
77679	77689	77690	77690	She	2224	" You 're alone -- at the Parker House ? "
77702	77710	77690	77690	She	2224	" Does it strike you as dangerous ? "
77711	77716	77611	77611	he	255	" No ; not dangerous-- "
77717	77729	77730	77730	She	2224	" But unconventional ? I see ; I suppose it is . "
77735	77754	77730	77730	She	2224	" I had n't thought of it , because I 've just done something so much more unconventional . "
77765	77783	77762	77762	her	2224	" I 've just refused to take back a sum of money -- that belonged to me . "
77818	77829	77810	77810	he	430	" Some one -- has come here to meet you ? "
77830	77833	77869	77869	her	2224	" Yes . "
77834	77839	77840	77840	She	2224	" With this offer ? "
77843	77853	77840	77840	She	2224	" And you refused -- because of the conditions ? "
77854	77858	77859	77859	she	2224	" I refused , "
77872	77878	77865	77865	He	430	" What were the conditions ? "
77879	77900	77840	77840	She	2224	" Oh , they were not onerous : just to sit at the head of his table now and then . "
77931	77941	77923	77923	he	430	" He wants you back -- at any price ? "
77942	77958	77959	77959	He	430	" Well -- a considerable price . At least the sum is considerable for me . "
77973	77984	77959	77959	He	430	" It was to meet him here that you came ? "
77995	78015	77985	77985	She	2224	" Meet him -- my husband ? HERE ? At this season he 's always at Cowes or Baden . "
78016	78022	77959	77959	He	430	" He sent some one ? "
78023	78026	77959	77959	He	430	" Yes . "
78027	78032	78033	78033	She	2224	" With a letter ? "
78038	78063	78035	78035	her	2224	" No ; just a message . He never writes . I do n't think I 've had more than one letter from him . "
78083	78090	78078	78078	Archer	430	" Why does he never write ? "
78091	78103	78104	78106	The young man	527	" Why should he ? What does one have secretaries for ? "
78144	78153	78111	78111	She	2224	" Did he send his secretary , then ? "
78182	78185	78172	78172	He	527	" And the person?"--
78186	78193	78194	78195	Madame Olenska	240	" The emissary ? The emissary , "
78201	78230	78194	78195	Madame Olenska	240	" might , for all I care , have left already ; but he has insisted on waiting till this evening ... in case ... on the chance ... "
78231	78243	78172	78172	He	527	" And you came out here to think the chance over ? "
78244	78271	78272	78272	They	2236	" I came out to get a breath of air . The hotel 's too stifling . I 'm taking the afternoon train back to Portsmouth . "
78305	78311	78294	78294	she	240	" You 're not changed . "
78317	78327	78294	78294	she	240	" I was , till I saw you again ; "
78344	78382	78383	78383	She	240	" This is horrible . Why should n't we go out a little on the bay ? There 's a breeze , and it will be cooler . We might take the steamboat down to Point Arley . "
78394	78429	78430	78430	he	527	" On a Monday morning there wo n't be anybody on the boat . My train does n't leave till evening : I 'm going back to New York . Why should n't we ? "
78444	78453	78440	78440	he	527	" Have n't we done all we could ? "
78454	78455	78459	78459	She	240	" Oh"--she
78498	78509	78510	78510	she	240	" You must n't say things like that to me , "
78513	78553	78554	78554	he	527	" I 'll say anything you like ; or nothing . I wo n't open my mouth unless you tell me to . What harm can it do to anybody ? All I want is to listen to you , "
78571	78578	78579	78579	he	527	" Oh , do n't calculate , "
78583	78606	78579	78579	he	527	" give me the day ! I want to get you away from that man . At what time was he coming ? "
78612	78616	78607	78607	Her	240	" At eleven . "
78617	78625	78557	78557	She	240	" Then you must come at once . "
78626	78639	78557	78557	She	240	" You need n't be afraid -- if I do n't come . "
78640	78687	78688	78688	She	240	" Nor you either -- if you do . I swear I only want to hear about you , to know what you 've been doing . It 's a hundred years since we 've met -- it may be another hundred before we meet again . "
78699	78721	78722	78722	she	240	" Why did n't you come down to the beach to fetch me , the day I was at Granny 's ? "
78725	78752	78722	78722	she	240	" Because you did n't look round -- because you did n't know I was there . I swore I would n't unless you looked round . "
78764	78774	78753	78753	He	527	" But I did n't look round on purpose . "
78775	78779	78838	78838	He	527	" On purpose ? "
78780	78804	78838	78838	He	527	" I knew you were there ; when you drove in I recognised the ponies . So I went down to the beach . "
78805	78817	78818	78818	She	240	" To get away from me as far as you could ? "
78825	78837	78818	78818	She	240	" To get away from you as far as I could . "
78849	78866	78867	78867	he	527	" Well , you see it 's no use . I may as well tell you , "
78870	78899	78867	78867	he	527	" that the business I came here for was just to find you . But , look here , we must start or we shall miss our boat . "
78900	78904	78905	78905	She	240	" Our boat ? "
78913	78931	78905	78905	She	240	" Oh , but I must go back to the hotel first : I must leave a note-- "
78932	78945	78946	78946	He	527	" As many notes as you please . You can write here . "
78961	79003	79004	79004	He	527	" I 've even got an envelope -- you see how everything 's predestined ! There -- steady the thing on your knee , and I 'll get the pen going in a second . They have to be humoured ; wait-- "
79019	79037	79004	79004	He	527	" It 's like jerking down the mercury in a thermometer : just a trick . Now try-- "

80746	80784	80743	80743	She	240	" Oh , the Carver danger is over . Dr. Carver is a very clever man . He wants a rich wife to finance his plans , and Medora is simply a good advertisement as a convert . "
80785	80791	80743	80743	She	240	" A convert to what ? "
80792	80851	80852	80852	She	240	" To all sorts of new and crazy social schemes . But , do you know , they interest me more than the blind conformity to tradition -- somebody else 's tradition -- that I see among our own friends . It seems stupid to have discovered America only to make it into a copy of another country . "
80858	80881	80852	80852	She	240	" Do you suppose Christopher Columbus would have taken all that trouble just to go to the Opera with the Selfridge Merrys ? "
80886	80898	80899	80899	he	430	" And Beaufort -- do you say these things to Beaufort ? "
80903	80923	80899	80899	he	430	" I have n't seen him for a long time . But I used to ; and he understands . "
80924	80953	80954	80954	He	430	" Ah , it 's what I 've always told you ; you do n't like us . And you like Beaufort because he 's so unlike us . "
80979	80997	80998	80998	he	430	" We 're damnably dull . We 've no character , no colour , no variety.--I wonder , "
81002	81010	80998	80998	he	430	" why you do n't go back ? "
81054	81063	81051	81051	she	2305	" I believe it 's because of you . "

81341	81374	81375	81375	Her	2305	" Yes : for I 'm of your making much more than you ever were of mine . I 'm the man who married one woman because another one told him to . "

81604	81622	81623	81623	he	2307	" And in that case there 's no reason on earth why you should n't go back ? "
81636	81644	81628	81628	Her	2305	" Oh , IS there no reason ? "
81645	81662	81663	81663	he	2307	" Not if you staked your all on the success of my marriage . My marriage , "

84038	84066	84067	84067	Archer	430	" Well -- I might say HERS , if it did not sound like a liberty . Shall I say instead : on behalf of abstract justice ? "
84072	84084	84067	84067	Archer	430	" In other words : you are Count Olenski 's messenger ? "

84260	84269	84270	84270	he	430	" Well -- and by God I will ! "
84330	84335	84336	84336	Archer	430	" Why the devil , "
84340	84378	84336	84336	Archer	430	" should you have thought -- since I suppose you 're appealing to me on the ground of my relationship to Madame Olenska -- that I should take a view contrary to the rest of her family ? "
84426	84430	84396	84396	His	436	" Oh , Monsieur-- "
84431	84437	84438	84438	Archer	430	" I ca n't imagine , "
84441	84481	84438	84438	Archer	430	" why you should have come to me when there are others so much nearer to the Countess ; still less why you thought I should be more accessible to the arguments I suppose you were sent over with . "
84492	84516	84482	84483	M. Riviere	436	" The arguments I want to present to you , Monsieur , are my own and not those I was sent over with . "
84517	84529	84530	84531	M. Riviere	436	" Then I see still less reason for listening to them . "
84566	84600	84560	84560	he	436	" Monsieur -- will you tell me one thing ? Is it my right to be here that you question ? Or do you perhaps believe the whole matter to be already closed ? "
84643	84657	84622	84622	Archer	430	" I beg your pardon : but why is n't the matter closed ? "
84667	84706	84658	84659	M. Riviere	436	" You do , then , agree with the rest of the family that , in face of the new proposals I have brought , it is hardly possible for Madame Olenska not to return to her husband ? "
84707	84711	84712	84712	Archer	430	" Good God ! "
84726	84778	84779	84779	Archer	430	" Before seeing her , I saw -- at Count Olenski 's request -- Mr. Lovell Mingott , with whom I had several talks before going to Boston .

85118	85124	85166	85167	M. Riviere	436	" The proposals you brought ? "

85211	85242	85243	85244	M. Riviere	436	" To beg you , Monsieur -- to beg you with all the force I 'm capable of -- not to let her go back.--Oh , do n't let her ! "
85296	85301	85302	85302	he	430	" May I ask , "
85307	85320	85302	85302	he	430	" if this is the line you took with the Countess Olenska ? "
85332	85385	85326	85326	his	436	" No , Monsieur : I accepted my mission in good faith . I really believed -- for reasons I need not trouble you with -- that it would be better for Madame Olenska to recover her situation , her fortune , the social consideration that her husband 's standing gives her . "
85386	85401	85302	85302	he	430	" So I supposed : you could hardly have accepted such a mission otherwise . "
85402	85410	85302	85302	he	430	" I should not have accepted it . "
85411	85416	85417	85417	Archer	214	" Well , then-- ? "
85430	85456	85417	85417	Archer	214	" Ah , Monsieur , after I had seen her , after I had listened to her , I knew she was better off here . "
85457	85461	85302	85302	he	430	" You knew-- ? "
85462	85546	85302	85302	he	430	" Monsieur , I discharged my mission faithfully : I put the Count 's arguments , I stated his offers , without adding any comment of my own . The Countess was good enough to listen patiently ; she carried her goodness so far as to see me twice ; she considered impartially all I had come to say . And it was in the course of these two talks that I changed my mind , that I came to see things differently . "
85547	85557	85417	85417	Archer	214	" May I ask what led to this change ? "
85558	85566	85302	85302	he	430	" Simply seeing the change in HER , "
85571	85583	85567	85568	M. Riviere	436	" The change in her ? Then you knew her before ? "
85592	85629	85584	85586	The young man	527	" I used to see her in her husband 's house . I have known Count Olenski for many years . You can imagine that he would not have sent a stranger on such a mission . "
85692	85702	85841	85842	M. Riviere	436	" The change -- what sort of a change ? "
85703	85714	85715	85716	M. Riviere	436	" Ah , Monsieur , if I could tell you ! "
85719	85840	85715	85716	M. Riviere	436	" Tenez -- the discovery , I suppose , of what I 'd never thought of before : that she 's an American . And that if you 're an American of HER kind -- of your kind -- things that are accepted in certain other societies , or at least put up with as part of a general convenient give - and - take -- become unthinkable , simply unthinkable . If Madame Olenska 's relations understood what these things were , their opposition to her returning would no doubt be as unconditional as her own ; but they seem to regard her husband 's wish to have her back as proof of an irresistible longing for domestic life . "
85849	85861	85841	85842	M. Riviere	436	" Whereas it 's far from being as simple as that . "
85938	85942	85943	85943	Archer	214	" Thank you , "
85947	85963	85943	85943	Archer	214	" There 's nothing to thank me for , Monsieur : it is I , rather-- "
85978	85985	85986	85986	he	436	" I should like , though , "
85993	86098	85986	85986	he	436	" to add one thing . You asked me if I was in Count Olenski 's employ . I am at this moment : I returned to him , a few months ago , for reasons of private necessity such as may happen to any one who has persons , ill and older persons , dependent on him . But from the moment that I have taken the step of coming here to say these things to you I consider myself discharged , and I shall tell him so on my return , and give him the reasons . That 's all , Monsieur . "
86108	86112	86113	86113	Archer	214	" Thank you , "

Yet I know she got it out from Worth only two years ago , because my seamstress always goes in to make over her Paris dresses before she wears them . "
86818	86828	86830	86831	Mrs. Archer	214	" Ah , Jane Merry is one of US , "
86888	86902	86883	86884	Mrs. Archer	214	" Yes ; she 's one of the few . In my youth , "
86907	87042	86903	86904	Miss Jackson	262	" it was considered vulgar to dress in the newest fashions ; and Amy Sillerton has always told me that in Boston the rule was to put away one 's Paris dresses for two years . Old Mrs. Baxter Pennilow , who did everything handsomely , used to import twelve a year , two velvet , two satin , two silk , and the other six of poplin and the finest cashmere . It was a standing order , and as she was ill for two years before she died they found forty - eight Worth dresses that had never been taken out of tissue paper ; and when the girls left off their mourning they were able to wear the first lot at the Symphony concerts without looking in advance of the fashion . "
87043	87078	87079	87080	Mrs. Archer	214	" Ah , well , Boston is more conservative than New York ; but I always think it 's a safe rule for a lady to lay aside her French dresses for one season , "
87083	87127	87079	87080	Mrs. Archer	214	" It was Beaufort who started the new fashion by making his wife clap her new clothes on her back as soon as they arrived : I must say at times it takes all Regina 's distinction not to look like ... like ... "

Hints have indeed not been wanting ; but since you appear unwilling to take them from others , I offer you this one myself , in the only form in which well - bred people of our kind can communicate unpleasant things to each other : by letting you understand that I know you mean to see Ellen when you are in Washington , and are perhaps going there expressly for that purpose ; and that , since you are sure to see her , I wish you to do so with my full and explicit approval -- and to take the opportunity of letting her know what the course of conduct you have encouraged her in is likely to lead to .

92230	92347	92224	92225	Mrs. Welland	218	" your great - grandfather 's money difficulties were private -- losses at cards , or signing a note for somebody -- I never quite knew , because Mamma would never speak of it . But she was brought up in the country because her mother had to leave New York after the disgrace , whatever it was : they lived up the Hudson alone , winter and summer , till Mamma was sixteen . It would never have occurred to Grandmamma Spicer to ask the family to ' countenance ' her , as I understand Regina calls it ; though a private disgrace is nothing compared to the scandal of ruining hundreds of innocent people .

I only meant that , after the decided stand Mamma took about its being Ellen 's duty to go back to her husband , it seems strange that she should be seized with this sudden whim to see her , when there are half a dozen other grandchildren that she might have asked for . But we must never forget that Mamma , in spite of her wonderful vitality , is a very old woman . "
94961	95041	94949	94949	his	339	" Yes : your mother 's a very old woman ; and for all we know Bencomb may not be as successful with very old people . As you say , my dear , it 's always one thing after another ; and in another ten or fifteen years I suppose I shall have the pleasing duty of looking about for a new doctor . It 's always better to make such a change before it 's absolutely necessary . "

Do n't suppose that I do n't understand your reasons for not wanting to let this feeling between us dwindle into an ordinary hole - and - corner love - affair .

What she does is just the contrary -- she fastens their eyelids open , so that they 're never again in the blessed darkness . Is n't there a Chinese torture like that ? There ought to be . Ah , believe me , it 's a miserable little country ! "

98282	98356	98279	98279	he	2682	" For US ? But there 's no US in that sense ! We 're near each other only if we stay far from each other . Then we can be ourselves . Otherwise we 're only Newland Archer , the husband of Ellen Olenska 's cousin , and Ellen Olenska , the cousin of Newland Archer 's wife , trying to be happy behind the backs of the people who trust them .

101158	101193	101155	101155	she	3109	" Was it because you told her so that she had to put you out on the way ? In my youth young men did n't desert pretty women unless they were made to ! "

She had n't been here five minutes before I 'd have gone down on my knees to keep her -- if only , for the last twenty years , I 'd been able to see where the floor was ! "
101336	101452	101332	101332	she	3109	" They 'd talked me over , as no doubt you know : persuaded me , Lovell , and Letterblair , and Augusta Welland , and all the rest of them , that I must hold out and cut off her allowance , till she was made to see that it was her duty to go back to Olenski . They thought they 'd convinced me when the secretary , or whatever he was , came out with the last proposals : handsome proposals I confess they were . After all , marriage is marriage , and money 's money -- both useful things in their way ... and I did n't know what to answer-- "

It 's not a gay prospect , but she does n't mind ; and of course I 've told Letterblair that she 's to be given her proper allowance . "

102236	102469	102470	102470	Archer	430	" That 's what she 's reduced me to already . The day after she got here she put on her best bonnet , and told me , as cool as a cucumber , that she was going to call on Regina Beaufort . ' I do n't know her ; who is she ? ' says I. ' She 's your grand - niece , and a most unhappy woman , ' she says . ' She 's the wife of a scoundrel , ' I answered . ' Well , ' she says , ' and so am I , and yet all my family want me to go back to him . ' Well , that floored me , and I let her go ; and finally one day she said it was raining too hard to go out on foot , and she wanted me to lend her my carriage . ' What for ? ' I asked her ; and she said : ' To go and see cousin Regina'--COUSIN ! Now , my dear , I looked out of the window , and saw it was n't raining a drop ; but I understood her , and I let her have the carriage .... After all , Regina 's a brave woman , and so is she ; and I 've always liked courage above everything . "

110301	110360	110363	110363	she	2940	" Archer read the letter over two or three times ; then he flung it down and burst out laughing . The sound of his laugh startled him . It recalled Janey 's midnight fright when she had caught him rocking with incomprehensible mirth over May 's telegram announcing that the date of their marriage had been advanced . "
110367	110388	110363	110363	she	2940	" he asked , checking his laugh with a supreme effort . May met the question with her unshaken candour . "

110497	110514	110515	110515	She	2940	" She hesitated , as if waiting for him to speak , and then added slowly : "
110530	110551	110524	110524	I	0	" She went up to Archer , and taking one of his cold hands pressed it quickly against her cheek . "
110563	111016	110524	110524	I	0	" she said , and turned to the door , her torn and muddy wedding - dress dragging after her across the room . XXXIII . It was , as Mrs. Archer smilingly said to Mrs. Welland , a great event for a young couple to give their first big dinner . The Newland Archers , since they had set up their household , had received a good deal of company in an informal way . Archer was fond of having three or four friends to dine , and May welcomed them with the beaming readiness of which her mother had set her the example in conjugal affairs . Her husband questioned whether , if left to herself , she would ever have asked any one to the house ; but he had long given up trying to disengage her real self from the shape into which tradition and training had moulded her . It was expected that well - off young couples in New York should do a good deal of informal entertaining , and a Welland married to an Archer was doubly pledged to the tradition . But a big dinner , with a hired chef and two borrowed footmen , with Roman punch , roses from Henderson 's , and menus on gilt - edged cards , was a different affair , and not to be lightly undertaken . As Mrs. Archer remarked , the Roman punch made all the difference ; not in itself but by its manifold implications -- since it signified either canvas - backs or terrapin , two soups , a hot and a cold sweet , full decolletage with short sleeves , and guests of a proportionate importance . It was always an interesting occasion when a young pair launched their first invitations in the third person , and their summons was seldom refused even by the seasoned and sought - after . Still , it was admittedly a triumph that the van der Luydens , at May 's request , should have stayed over in order to be present at her farewell dinner for the Countess Olenska . The two mothers - in - law sat in May 's drawing - room on the afternoon of the great day , Mrs. Archer writing out the menus on Tiffany 's thickest gilt - edged bristol , while Mrs. Welland superintended the placing of the palms and standard lamps . Archer , arriving late from his office , found them still there . Mrs. Archer had turned her attention to the name - cards for the table , and Mrs. Welland was considering the effect of bringing forward the large gilt sofa , so that another "
111018	111129	111130	111133	Henry van der Luyden	304	" might be created between the piano and the window . May , they told him , was in the dining - room inspecting the mound of Jacqueminot roses and maidenhair in the centre of the long table , and the placing of the Maillard bonbons in openwork silver baskets between the candelabra . On the piano stood a large basket of orchids which Mr. van der Luyden had had sent from Skuytercliff . Everything was , in short , as it should be on the approach of so considerable an event . Mrs. Archer ran thoughtfully over the list , checking off each name with her sharp gold pen . "
111198	111210	111216	111216	Newland	495	" Mrs. Welland surveyed her son - in - law affectionately . "
111232	111233	111211	111212	No one	619	" "
111238	111243	111211	111212	No one	619	" said Mrs. Archer , "

111300	111323	111267	111267	Ellen	232	" Mrs. Welland cheerfully continued . Archer turned toward the door , and his mother - in - law called to him : "
111345	111385	111813	111813	you	0	" But he affected not to hear , and sprang up the stairs to his library . The room looked at him like an alien countenance composed into a polite grimace ; and he perceived that it had been ruthlessly "
111388	111413	111813	111813	you	0	" and prepared , by a judicious distribution of ash - trays and cedar - wood boxes , for the gentlemen to smoke in . "
111418	111422	111813	111813	you	0	" he thought , "
111428	111749	111813	111813	you	0	" and he went on to his dressing - room . Ten days had passed since Madame Olenska 's departure from New York . During those ten days Archer had had no sign from her but that conveyed by the return of a key wrapped in tissue paper , and sent to his office in a sealed envelope addressed in her hand . This retort to his last appeal might have been interpreted as a classic move in a familiar game ; but the young man chose to give it a different meaning . She was still fighting against her fate ; but she was going to Europe , and she was not returning to her husband . Nothing , therefore , was to prevent his following her ; and once he had taken the irrevocable step , and had proved to her that it was irrevocable , he believed she would not send him away . This confidence in the future had steadied him to play his part in the present . It had kept him from writing to her , or betraying , by any sign or act , his misery and mortification . It seemed to him that in the deadly silent game between them the trumps were still in his hands ; and he waited . There had been , nevertheless , moments sufficiently difficult to pass ; as when Mr. Letterblair , the day after Madame Olenska 's departure , had sent for him to go over the details of the trust which Mrs. Manson Mingott wished to create for her granddaughter . For a couple of hours Archer had examined the terms of the deed with his senior , all the while obscurely feeling that if he had been consulted it was for some reason other than the obvious one of his cousinship ; and that the close of the conference would reveal it . "
111764	111780	111752	111753	the lady	681	" Mr. Letterblair had summed up , after mumbling over a summary of the settlement . "

111802	111811	111752	111753	the lady	681	" Archer echoed with a touch of derision . "
111828	111842	111813	111813	you	0	" Mr. Letterblair 's bushy eyebrows went up a fraction of an inch . "

111887	111934	111935	111935	My	0	" But Archer paused . Mr. Letterblair had laid his pen - handle against his big corrugated nose , and was looking down it with the expression assumed by virtuous elderly gentlemen when they wish their youngers to understand that virtue is not synonymous with ignorance . "
111984	111998	111935	111935	My	0	" Mr. Letterblair unlocked a drawer and pushed a folded paper toward Archer . "
112008	112034	112035	112035	I	0	" And then , as Archer made no effort to glance at the paper or to repudiate the suggestion , the lawyer somewhat flatly continued : "

112079	112122	112152	112152	She	683	" Archer assented , pushing back the paper . A day or two later , on responding to a summons from Mrs. Manson Mingott , his soul had been more deeply tried . He had found the old lady depressed and querulous . "
112130	112143	112125	112125	she	683	" she began at once ; and without waiting for his reply : "
112323	112348	112318	112318	I	0	" Two tears , the parched tears of the old , rolled down her puffy cheeks and vanished in the abysses of her bosom . "
112354	112358	112350	112350	I	0	" she concluded , "
112378	112440	112456	112456	you	0	" And she twinkled a little wistfully at Archer . It was that evening , on his return home , that May announced her intention of giving a farewell dinner to her cousin . Madame Olenska 's name had not been pronounced between them since the night of her flight to Washington ; and Archer looked at his wife with surprise . "
112446	112454	112456	112456	you	0	" he interrogated . Her colour rose . "
112467	112468	112462	112462	you	0	" "
112487	112488	112489	112489	I	0	" "
112497	112509	112489	112489	I	0	" she said , quietly rising and going to her desk . "
112528	112550	112521	112521	she	352	" She paused , embarrassed and yet smiling , and Archer suddenly saw before him the embodied image of the Family . "
112556	112735	112521	112521	she	352	" he said , staring with unseeing eyes at the list of guests that she had put in his hand . When he entered the drawing - room before dinner May was stooping over the fire and trying to coax the logs to burn in their unaccustomed setting of immaculate tiles . The tall lamps were all lit , and Mr. van der Luyden 's orchids had been conspicuously disposed in various receptacles of modern porcelain and knobby silver . Mrs. Newland Archer 's drawing - room was generally thought a great success . A gilt bamboo jardiniere , in which the primulas and cinerarias were punctually renewed , blocked the access to the bay window ( where the old - fashioned would have preferred a bronze reduction of the Venus of Milo ) ; the sofas and arm - chairs of pale brocade were cleverly grouped about little plush tables densely covered with silver toys , porcelain animals and efflorescent photograph frames ; and tall rosy - shaded lamps shot up like tropical flowers among the palms . "
112749	112850	112740	112740	Ellen	232	" said May , rising flushed from her struggle , and sending about her a glance of pardonable pride . The brass tongs which she had propped against the side of the chimney fell with a crash that drowned her husband 's answer ; and before he could restore them Mr. and Mrs. van der Luyden were announced . The other guests quickly followed , for it was known that the van der Luydens liked to dine punctually . The room was nearly full , and Archer was engaged in showing to Mrs. Selfridge Merry a small highly - varnished Verbeckhoven "
112855	112989	112740	112740	Ellen	232	" which Mr. Welland had given May for Christmas , when he found Madame Olenska at his side . She was excessively pale , and her pallor made her dark hair seem denser and heavier than ever . Perhaps that , or the fact that she had wound several rows of amber beads about her neck , reminded him suddenly of the little Ellen Mingott he had danced with at children 's parties , when Medora Manson had first brought her to New York . The amber beads were trying to her complexion , or her dress was perhaps unbecoming : her face looked lustreless and almost ugly , and he had never loved it as he did at that minute . Their hands met , and he thought he heard her say : "
112999	113019	112740	112740	Ellen	232	" ; then there was an unmeaning noise of opening doors , and after an interval May 's voice : "
113035	113116	113029	113029	you	2973	" Madame Olenska put her hand on his arm , and he noticed that the hand was ungloved , and remembered how he had kept his eyes fixed on it the evening that he had sat with her in the little Twenty - third Street drawing - room . All the beauty that had forsaken her face seemed to have taken refuge in the long pale fingers and faintly dimpled knuckles on his sleeve , and he said to himself : "
113133	113144	113131	113131	her--	2974	" It was only at an entertainment ostensibly offered to a "
113147	113172	112740	112740	Ellen	232	" that Mrs. van der Luyden could suffer the diminution of being placed on her host 's left . The fact of Madame Olenska 's "
113174	113510	113131	113131	her--	2974	" could hardly have been more adroitly emphasised than by this farewell tribute ; and Mrs. van der Luyden accepted her displacement with an affability which left no doubt as to her approval . There were certain things that had to be done , and if done at all , done handsomely and thoroughly ; and one of these , in the old New York code , was the tribal rally around a kinswoman about to be eliminated from the tribe . There was nothing on earth that the Wellands and Mingotts would not have done to proclaim their unalterable affection for the Countess Olenska now that her passage for Europe was engaged ; and Archer , at the head of his table , sat marvelling at the silent untiring activity with which her popularity had been retrieved , grievances against her silenced , her past countenanced , and her present irradiated by the family approval . Mrs. van der Luyden shone on her with the dim benevolence which was her nearest approach to cordiality , and Mr. van der Luyden , from his seat at May 's right , cast down the table glances plainly intended to justify all the carnations he had sent from Skuytercliff . Archer , who seemed to be assisting at the scene in a state of odd imponderability , as if he floated somewhere between chandelier and ceiling , wondered at nothing so much as his own share in the proceedings . As his glance travelled from one placid well - fed face to another he saw all the harmless - looking people engaged upon May 's canvas - backs as a band of dumb conspirators , and himself and the pale woman on his right as the centre of their conspiracy . And then it came over him , in a vast flash made up of many broken gleams , that to all of them he and Madame Olenska were lovers , lovers in the extreme sense peculiar to "
113512	113624	112740	112740	Ellen	232	" vocabularies . He guessed himself to have been , for months , the centre of countless silently observing eyes and patiently listening ears ; he understood that , by means as yet unknown to him , the separation between himself and the partner of his guilt had been achieved , and that now the whole tribe had rallied about his wife on the tacit assumption that nobody knew anything , or had ever imagined anything , and that the occasion of the entertainment was simply May Archer 's natural desire to take an affectionate leave of her friend and cousin . It was the old New York way of taking life "
113629	113659	113131	113131	her--	2974	" : the way of people who dreaded scandal more than disease , who placed decency above courage , and who considered that nothing was more ill - bred than "
113662	113731	113131	113131	her--	2974	" except the behaviour of those who gave rise to them . As these thoughts succeeded each other in his mind Archer felt like a prisoner in the centre of an armed camp . He looked about the table , and guessed at the inexorableness of his captors from the tone in which , over the asparagus from Florida , they were dealing with Beaufort and his wife . "
113738	113742	113131	113131	her--	2974	" he thought , "
113748	113796	113797	113797	You	0	" and a deathly sense of the superiority of implication and analogy over direct action , and of silence over rash words , closed in on him like the doors of the family vault . He laughed , and met Mrs. van der Luyden 's startled eyes . "
113802	113810	113797	113797	You	0	" she said with a pinched smile . "
113830	113835	113827	113827	I	0	" and Archer muttered : "
113839	113931	113827	113827	I	0	" At this point , he became conscious that Madame Olenska 's other neighbour had been engaged for some time with the lady on his right . At the same moment he saw that May , serenely enthroned between Mr. van der Luyden and Mr. Selfridge Merry , had cast a quick glance down the table . It was evident that the host and the lady on his right could not sit through the whole meal in silence . He turned to Madame Olenska , and her pale smile met him . "
113941	113947	113827	113827	I	0	" it seemed to say . "
113955	113985	113949	113949	you	475	" he asked in a voice that surprised him by its naturalness ; and she answered that , on the contrary , she had seldom travelled with fewer discomforts . "
113998	114022	114023	114023	I	0	" she added ; and he remarked that she would not suffer from that particular hardship in the country she was going to . "
114026	114032	114023	114023	I	0	" he declared with intensity , "
114051	114120	114121	114121	I	0	" She said she did not wonder , but remarked that , after all , one could always carry an extra rug , and that every form of travel had its hardships ; to which he abruptly returned that he thought them all of no account compared with the blessedness of getting away . She changed colour , and he added , his voice suddenly rising in pitch : "
114133	114151	114152	114152	I	0	" A tremor crossed her face , and leaning over to Reggie Chivers , he cried out : "
114182	114245	114159	114159	you	396	" at which Mrs. Reggie piped up that she could not think of letting Reggie go till after the Martha Washington Ball she was getting up for the Blind Asylum in Easter week ; and her husband placidly observed that by that time he would have to be practising for the International Polo match . But Mr. Selfridge Merry had caught the phrase "
114250	114341	114176	114176	I	0	" and having once circled the globe in his steam - yacht , he seized the opportunity to send down the table several striking items concerning the shallowness of the Mediterranean ports . Though , after all , he added , it did n't matter ; for when you 'd seen Athens and Smyrna and Constantinople , what else was there ? And Mrs. Merry said she could never be too grateful to Dr. Bencomb for having made them promise not to go to Naples on account of the fever . "
114353	114628	114343	114343	you	2980	" her husband conceded , anxious to have it understood that he was no frivolous globe - trotter . And at this point the ladies went up to the drawing - room . In the library , in spite of weightier presences , Lawrence Lefferts predominated . The talk , as usual , had veered around to the Beauforts , and even Mr. van der Luyden and Mr. Selfridge Merry , installed in the honorary arm - chairs tacitly reserved for them , paused to listen to the younger man 's philippic . Never had Lefferts so abounded in the sentiments that adorn Christian manhood and exalt the sanctity of the home . Indignation lent him a scathing eloquence , and it was clear that if others had followed his example , and acted as he talked , society would never have been weak enough to receive a foreign upstart like Beaufort -- no , sir , not even if he 'd married a van der Luyden or a Lanning instead of a Dallas . And what chance would there have been , Lefferts wrathfully questioned , of his marrying into such a family as the Dallases , if he had not already wormed his way into certain houses , as people like Mrs. Lemuel Struthers had managed to worm theirs in his wake ? If society chose to open its doors to vulgar women the harm was not great , though the gain was doubtful ; but once it got in the way of tolerating men of obscure origin and tainted wealth the end was total disintegration -- and at no distant date .

He saw , on the faces about him , expressions of interest , amusement and even mirth . He listened to the younger men 's laughter , and to the praise of the Archer Madeira , which Mr. van der Luyden and Mr. Merry were thoughtfully celebrating . Through it all he was dimly aware of a general attitude of friendliness toward himself , as if the guard of the prisoner he felt himself to be were trying to soften his captivity ; and the perception increased his passionate determination to be free . In the drawing - room , where they presently joined the ladies , he met May 's triumphant eyes , and read in them the conviction that everything had "

Mrs. Selfridge Merry bore across the room to join them , and it became clear to Archer that here also a conspiracy of rehabilitation and obliteration was going on . The silent organisation which held his little world together was determined to put itself on record as never for a moment having questioned the propriety of Madame Olenska 's conduct , or the completeness of Archer 's domestic felicity . All these amiable and inexorable persons were resolutely engaged in pretending to each other that they had never heard of , suspected , or even conceived possible , the least hint to the contrary ; and from this tissue of elaborate mutual dissimulation Archer once more disengaged the fact that New York believed him to be Madame Olenska 's lover . He caught the glitter of victory in his wife 's eyes , and for the first time understood that she shared the belief . The discovery roused a laughter of inner devils that reverberated through all his efforts to discuss the Martha Washington ball with Mrs. Reggie Chivers and little Mrs. Newland ; and so the evening swept on , running and running like a senseless river that did not know how to stop . At length he saw that Madame Olenska had risen and was saying good - bye . He understood that in a moment she would be gone , and tried to remember what he had said to her at dinner ; but he could not recall a single word they had exchanged . She went up to May , the rest of the company making a circle about her as she advanced . The two young women clasped hands ; then May bent forward and kissed her cousin . "

A moment later he was in the hall , putting Madame Olenska 's cloak about her shoulders . Through all his confusion of mind he had held fast to the resolve to say nothing that might startle or disturb her . Convinced that no power could now turn him from his purpose he had found strength to let events shape themselves as they would . But as he followed Madame Olenska into the hall he thought with a sudden hunger of being for a moment alone with her at the door of her carriage . "

For a moment , in the billowy darkness inside the big landau , he caught the dim oval of a face , eyes shining steadily -- and she was gone . As he went up the steps he crossed Lawrence Lefferts coming down with his wife . Lefferts caught his host by the sleeve , drawing back to let Gertrude pass . "

He had just got back from a big official reception for the inauguration of the new galleries at the Metropolitan Museum , and the spectacle of those great spaces crowded with the spoils of the ages , where the throng of fashion circulated through a series of scientifically catalogued treasures , had suddenly pressed on a rusted spring of memory . "

The vision had roused a host of other associations , and he sat looking with new eyes at the library which , for over thirty years , had been the scene of his solitary musings and of all the family confabulations . It was the room in which most of the real things of his life had happened . There his wife , nearly twenty - six years ago , had broken to him , with a blushing circumlocution that would have caused the young women of the new generation to smile , the news that she was to have a child ; and there their eldest boy , Dallas , too delicate to be taken to church in midwinter , had been christened by their old friend the Bishop of New York , the ample magnificent irreplaceable Bishop , so long the pride and ornament of his diocese . There Dallas had first staggered across the floor shouting "

116901	116940	116813	116813	Dad	3013	" remained an unchanged institution . It was in the library that he and May had always discussed the future of the children : the studies of Dallas and his young brother Bill , Mary 's incurable indifference to "

116958	117061	116813	116813	Dad	3013	" which had finally landed the restless and curious Dallas in the office of a rising New York architect . The young men nowadays were emancipating themselves from the law and business and taking up all sorts of new things . If they were not absorbed in state politics or municipal reform , the chances were that they were going in for Central American archaeology , for architecture or landscape - engineering ; taking a keen and learned interest in the prerevolutionary buildings of their own country , studying and adapting Georgian types , and protesting at the meaningless use of the word "

117070	117139	117141	117143	the professional politician	3014	" houses except the millionaire grocers of the suburbs . But above all -- sometimes Archer put it above all -- it was in that library that the Governor of New York , coming down from Albany one evening to dine and spend the night , had turned to his host , and said , banging his clenched fist on the table and gnashing his eye - glasses : "

117185	117482	117167	117167	men	867	" how Archer had glowed at the phrase ! How eagerly he had risen up at the call ! It was an echo of Ned Winsett 's old appeal to roll his sleeves up and get down into the muck ; but spoken by a man who set the example of the gesture , and whose summons to follow him was irresistible . Archer , as he looked back , was not sure that men like himself WERE what his country needed , at least in the active service to which Theodore Roosevelt had pointed ; in fact , there was reason to think it did not , for after a year in the State Assembly he had not been re - elected , and had dropped back thankfully into obscure if useful municipal work , and from that again to the writing of occasional articles in one of the reforming weeklies that were trying to shake the country out of its apathy . It was little enough to look back on ; but when he remembered to what the young men of his generation and his set had looked forward -- the narrow groove of money - making , sport and society to which their vision had been limited -- even his small contribution to the new state of things seemed to count , as each brick counts in a well - built wall . He had done little in public life ; he would always be by nature a contemplative and a dilettante ; but he had had high things to contemplate , great things to delight in ; and one great man 's friendship to be his strength and pride . He had been , in short , what people were beginning to call "
117487	117521	117523	117523	Archer	430	" In New York , for many years past , every new movement , philanthropic , municipal or artistic , had taken account of his opinion and wanted his name . People said : "
117524	118187	117523	117523	Archer	430	" when there was a question of starting the first school for crippled children , reorganising the Museum of Art , founding the Grolier Club , inaugurating the new Library , or getting up a new society of chamber music . His days were full , and they were filled decently . He supposed it was all a man ought to ask . Something he knew he had missed : the flower of life . But he thought of it now as a thing so unattainable and improbable that to have repined would have been like despairing because one had not drawn the first prize in a lottery . There were a hundred million tickets in HIS lottery , and there was only one prize ; the chances had been too decidedly against him . When he thought of Ellen Olenska it was abstractly , serenely , as one might think of some imaginary beloved in a book or a picture : she had become the composite vision of all that he had missed . That vision , faint and tenuous as it was , had kept him from thinking of other women . He had been what was called a faithful husband ; and when May had suddenly died -- carried off by the infectious pneumonia through which she had nursed their youngest child -- he had honestly mourned her . Their long years together had shown him that it did not so much matter if marriage was a dull duty , as long as it kept the dignity of a duty : lapsing from that , it became a mere battle of ugly appetites . Looking about him , he honoured his own past , and mourned for it . After all , there was good in the old ways . His eyes , making the round of the room -- done over by Dallas with English mezzotints , Chippendale cabinets , bits of chosen blue - and - white and pleasantly shaded electric lamps -- came back to the old Eastlake writing - table that he had never been willing to banish , and to his first photograph of May , which still kept its place beside his inkstand . There she was , tall , round - bosomed and willowy , in her starched muslin and flapping Leghorn , as he had seen her under the orange - trees in the Mission garden . And as he had seen her that day , so she had remained ; never quite at the same height , yet never far below it : generous , faithful , unwearied ; but so lacking in imagination , so incapable of growth , that the world of her youth had fallen into pieces and rebuilt itself without her ever being conscious of the change . This hard bright blindness had kept her immediate horizon apparently unaltered . Her incapacity to recognise change made her children conceal their views from her as Archer concealed his ; there had been , from the first , a joint pretence of sameness , a kind of innocent family hypocrisy , in which father and children had unconsciously collaborated . And she had died thinking the world a good place , full of loving and harmonious households like her own , and resigned to leave it because she was convinced that , whatever happened , Newland would continue to inculcate in Dallas the same principles and prejudices which had shaped his parents ' lives , and that Dallas in turn ( when Newland followed her ) would transmit the sacred trust to little Bill . And of Mary she was sure as of her own self . So , having snatched little Bill from the grave , and given her life in the effort , she went contentedly to her place in the Archer vault in St. Mark 's , where Mrs. Archer already lay safe from the terrifying "

Mary Chivers was as tall and fair as her mother , but large - waisted , flat - chested and slightly slouching , as the altered fashion required . Mary Chivers 's mighty feats of athleticism could not have been performed with the twenty - inch waist that May Archer 's azure sash so easily spanned . And the difference seemed symbolic ; the mother 's life had been as closely girt as her figure . Mary , who was no less conventional , and no more intelligent , yet led a larger life and held more tolerant views . There was good in the new order too . The telephone clicked , and Archer , turning from the photographs , unhooked the transmitter at his elbow . How far they were from the days when the legs of the brass - buttoned messenger boy had been New York 's only means of quick communication ! "

The fact would not ordinarily have surprised Archer , for long - distance telephoning had become as much a matter of course as electric lighting and five - day Atlantic voyages . But the laugh did startle him ; it still seemed wonderful that across all those miles and miles of country -- forest , river , mountain , prairie , roaring cities and busy indifferent millions -- Dallas 's laugh should be able to say : "

On the contrary , from what he had seen of her , he thought she would be naturally included in it . Still , change was change , and differences were differences , and much as he felt himself drawn toward his future daughter - in - law , it was tempting to seize this last chance of being alone with his boy . There was no reason why he should not seize it , except the profound one that he had lost the habit of travel . May had disliked to move except for valid reasons , such as taking the children to the sea or in the mountains : she could imagine no other motive for leaving the house in Thirty - ninth Street or their comfortable quarters at the Wellands ' in Newport . After Dallas had taken his degree she had thought it her duty to travel for six months ; and the whole family had made the old - fashioned tour through England , Switzerland and Italy . Their time being limited ( no one knew why ) they had omitted France . Archer remembered Dallas 's wrath at being asked to contemplate Mont Blanc instead of Rheims and Chartres . But Mary and Bill wanted mountain - climbing , and had already yawned their way in Dallas 's wake through the English cathedrals ; and May , always fair to her children , had insisted on holding the balance evenly between their athletic and artistic proclivities . She had indeed proposed that her husband should go to Paris for a fortnight , and join them on the Italian lakes after they had "

119152	119216	118772	118772	you	3197	" he said ; and May 's face had brightened at his setting such a good example to Dallas . Since her death , nearly two years before , there had been no reason for his continuing in the same routine . His children had urged him to travel : Mary Chivers had felt sure it would do him good to go abroad and "
119221	119418	118772	118772	you	3197	" The very mysteriousness of such a cure made her the more confident of its efficacy . But Archer had found himself held fast by habit , by memories , by a sudden startled shrinking from new things . Now , as he reviewed his past , he saw into what a deep rut he had sunk . The worst of doing one 's duty was that it apparently unfitted one for doing anything else . At least that was the view that the men of his generation had taken . The trenchant divisions between right and wrong , honest and dishonest , respectable and the reverse , had left so little scope for the unforeseen . There are moments when a man 's imagination , so easily subdued to what it lives in , suddenly rises above its daily level , and surveys the long windings of destiny . Archer hung there and wondered .... What was left of the little world he had grown up in , and whose standards had bent and bound him ? He remembered a sneering prophecy of poor Lawrence Lefferts 's , uttered years ago in that very room : "
119436	119525	118772	118772	you	3197	" It was just what Archer 's eldest son , the pride of his life , was doing ; and nobody wondered or reproved . Even the boy 's Aunt Janey , who still looked so exactly as she used to in her elderly youth , had taken her mother 's emeralds and seed - pearls out of their pink cotton - wool , and carried them with her own twitching hands to the future bride ; and Fanny Beaufort , instead of looking disappointed at not receiving a "
119527	119845	118772	118772	you	3197	" from a Paris jeweller , had exclaimed at their old - fashioned beauty , and declared that when she wore them she should feel like an Isabey miniature . Fanny Beaufort , who had appeared in New York at eighteen , after the death of her parents , had won its heart much as Madame Olenska had won it thirty years earlier ; only instead of being distrustful and afraid of her , society took her joyfully for granted . She was pretty , amusing and accomplished : what more did any one want ? Nobody was narrow - minded enough to rake up against her the half - forgotten facts of her father 's past and her own origin . Only the older people remembered so obscure an incident in the business life of New York as Beaufort 's failure , or the fact that after his wife 's death he had been quietly married to the notorious Fanny Ring , and had left the country with his new wife , and a little girl who inherited her beauty . He was subsequently heard of in Constantinople , then in Russia ; and a dozen years later American travellers were handsomely entertained by him in Buenos Ayres , where he represented a large insurance agency . He and his wife died there in the odour of prosperity ; and one day their orphaned daughter had appeared in New York in charge of May Archer 's sister - in - law , Mrs. Jack Welland , whose husband had been appointed the girl 's guardian . The fact threw her into almost cousinly relationship with Newland Archer 's children , and nobody was surprised when Dallas 's engagement was announced . Nothing could more dearly give the measure of the distance that the world had travelled . People nowadays were too busy -- busy with reforms and "
119848	119975	118772	118772	you	3197	" with fads and fetishes and frivolities -- to bother much about their neighbours . And of what account was anybody 's past , in the huge kaleidoscope where all the social atoms spun around on the same plane ? Newland Archer , looking out of his hotel window at the stately gaiety of the Paris streets , felt his heart beating with the confusion and eagerness of youth . It was long since it had thus plunged and reared under his widening waistcoat , leaving him , the next minute , with an empty breast and hot temples . He wondered if it was thus that his son 's conducted itself in the presence of Miss Fanny Beaufort -- and decided that it was not . "
119990	120018	118772	118772	you	3197	" he reflected , recalling the cool composure with which the young man had announced his engagement , and taken for granted that his family would approve . "

One of the things he had stipulated -- almost the only one -- when he had agreed to come abroad with Dallas , was that , in Paris , he should n't be made to go to one of the newfangled "

Archer had pictured often enough , in the first impatient years , the scene of his return to Paris ; then the personal vision had faded , and he had simply tried to see the city as the setting of Madame Olenska 's life . Sitting alone at night in his library , after the household had gone to bed , he had evoked the radiant outbreak of spring down the avenues of horse - chestnuts , the flowers and statues in the public gardens , the whiff of lilacs from the flower - carts , the majestic roll of the river under the great bridges , and the life of art and study and pleasure that filled each mighty artery to bursting . Now the spectacle was before him in its glory , and as he looked out on it he felt shy , old - fashioned , inadequate : a mere grey speck of a man compared with the ruthless magnificent fellow he had dreamed of being .... Dallas 's hand came down cheerily on his shoulder . "

120466	120527	120454	120456	the Countess Olenska	496	" He said it lightly , carelessly , as he might have imparted any casual item of information , such as the hour at which their train was to leave for Florence the next evening . Archer looked at him , and thought he saw in his gay young eyes a gleam of his great - grandmother Mingott 's malice . "
120536	120540	120541	120541	Fanny	503	" Dallas pursued . "

120698	120726	120727	120727	I	0	" Dallas 's eye brows went up whimsically . Then , getting no answer , he slipped his arm through his father 's with a confidential pressure . "
120737	120750	120734	120734	she	503	" Archer felt his colour rise under his son 's unabashed gaze . "

120832	120844	120827	120827	I	0	" His father drew back a step , releasing his arm . "
120864	120865	120869	120869	Dad	504	" "
120885	120924	120878	120878	she	503	" Dallas belonged body and soul to the new generation . He was the first - born of Newland and May Archer , yet it had never been possible to inculcate in him even the rudiments of reserve . "
120943	120967	120969	120969	Fanny	503	" he always objected when enjoined to discretion . But Archer , meeting his eyes , saw the filial light under their banter . "
120971	120972	120969	120969	Fanny	503	" "
120989	120995	120985	120985	you	0	" continued his surprising son . "
121000	121009	120996	120996	I	0	" echoed Archer with a kind of solemnity . "

121030	121031	121023	121023	mother	922	" "
121086	121118	121119	121119	She	1787	" Archer received this strange communication in silence . His eyes remained unseeingly fixed on the thronged sunlit square below the window . At length he said in a low voice : "
121124	121125	121119	121119	She	1787	" "
121208	121213	121206	121206	Dad	504	" Dallas broke off , "
121248	121589	121238	121238	I	0	" Archer did not accompany his son to Versailles . He preferred to spend the afternoon in solitary roamings through Paris . He had to deal all at once with the packed regrets and stifled memories of an inarticulate lifetime . After a little while he did not regret Dallas 's indiscretion . It seemed to take an iron band from his heart to know that , after all , some one had guessed and pitied .... And that it should have been his wife moved him indescribably . Dallas , for all his affectionate insight , would not have understood that . To the boy , no doubt , the episode was only a pathetic instance of vain frustration , of wasted forces . But was it really no more ? For a long time Archer sat on a bench in the Champs Elysees and wondered , while the stream of life rolled by .... A few streets away , a few hours away , Ellen Olenska waited . She had never gone back to her husband , and when he had died , some years before , she had made no change in her way of living . There was nothing now to keep her and Archer apart -- and that afternoon he was to see her . He got up and walked across the Place de la Concorde and the Tuileries gardens to the Louvre . She had once told him that she often went there , and he had a fancy to spend the intervening time in a place where he could think of her as perhaps having lately been . For an hour or more he wandered from gallery to gallery through the dazzle of afternoon light , and one by one the pictures burst on him in their half - forgotten splendour , filling his soul with the long echoes of beauty . After all , his life had been too starved .... Suddenly , before an effulgent Titian , he found himself saying : "
121597	121796	121801	121801	they	3075	" and then he turned away . For such summer dreams it was too late ; but surely not for a quiet harvest of friendship , of comradeship , in the blessed hush of her nearness . He went back to the hotel , where he and Dallas were to meet ; and together they walked again across the Place de la Concorde and over the bridge that leads to the Chamber of Deputies . Dallas , unconscious of what was going on in his father 's mind , was talking excitedly and abundantly of Versailles . He had had but one previous glimpse of it , during a holiday trip in which he had tried to pack all the sights he had been deprived of when he had had to go with the family to Switzerland ; and tumultuous enthusiasm and cock - sure criticism tripped each other up on his lips . As Archer listened , his sense of inadequacy and inexpressiveness increased . The boy was not insensitive , he knew ; but he had the facility and self - confidence that came of looking at fate not as a master but as an equal . "
121813	121861	121807	121807	they	3075	" he mused , thinking of his son as the spokesman of the new generation which had swept away all the old landmarks , and with them the sign - posts and the danger - signal . Suddenly Dallas stopped short , grasping his father 's arm . "
121867	122108	121807	121807	they	3075	" he exclaimed . They had come out into the great tree - planted space before the Invalides . The dome of Mansart floated ethereally above the budding trees and the long grey front of the building : drawing up into itself all the rays of afternoon light , it hung there like the visible symbol of the race 's glory . Archer knew that Madame Olenska lived in a square near one of the avenues radiating from the Invalides ; and he had pictured the quarter as quiet and almost obscure , forgetting the central splendour that lit it up . Now , by some queer process of association , that golden light became for him the pervading illumination in which she lived . For nearly thirty years , her life -- of which he knew so strangely little -- had been spent in this rich atmosphere that he already felt to be too dense and yet too stimulating for his lungs . He thought of the theatres she must have been to , the pictures she must have looked at , the sober and splendid old houses she must have frequented , the people she must have talked with , the incessant stir of ideas , curiosities , images and associations thrown out by an intensely social race in a setting of immemorial manners ; and suddenly he remembered the young Frenchman who had once said to him : "
122123	122373	121807	121807	they	3075	" Archer had not seen M. Riviere , or heard of him , for nearly thirty years ; and that fact gave the measure of his ignorance of Madame Olenska 's existence . More than half a lifetime divided them , and she had spent the long interval among people he did not know , in a society he but faintly guessed at , in conditions he would never wholly understand . During that time he had been living with his youthful memory of her ; but she had doubtless had other and more tangible companionship . Perhaps she too had kept her memory of him as something apart ; but if she had , it must have been like a relic in a small dim chapel , where there was not time to pray every day .... They had crossed the Place des Invalides , and were walking down one of the thoroughfares flanking the building . It was a quiet quarter , after all , in spite of its splendour and its history ; and the fact gave one an idea of the riches Paris had to draw on , since such scenes as this were left to the few and the indifferent . The day was fading into a soft sun - shot haze , pricked here and there by a yellow electric light , and passers were rare in the little square into which they had turned . Dallas stopped again , and looked up . "
122379	122476	121807	121807	they	3075	" he said , slipping his arm through his father 's with a movement from which Archer 's shyness did not shrink ; and they stood together looking up at the house . It was a modern building , without distinctive character , but many - windowed , and pleasantly balconied up its wide cream - coloured front . On one of the upper balconies , which hung well above the rounded tops of the horse - chestnuts in the square , the awnings were still lowered , as though the sun had just left it . "
122482	122509	121807	121807	they	3075	" Dallas conjectured ; and moving toward the porte - cochere he put his head into the porter 's lodge , and came back to say : "
122522	122543	122544	122544	I	0	" Archer remained motionless , gazing at the upper windows as if the end of their pilgrimage had been attained . "
122555	122575	122544	122544	I	0	" his son at length reminded him . The father glanced away at an empty bench under the trees . "
122585	122589	122578	122578	I	0	" he said . "
122596	122601	122632	122632	I	0	" his son exclaimed . "
122620	122629	122607	122607	I	0	" Dallas paused before him , visibly bewildered . "
122648	122649	122632	122632	I	0	" "
122655	122660	122650	122650	I	0	" said Archer slowly . "
122670	122671	122665	122665	she	3077	" "
122683	122694	122678	122678	I	0	" Dallas gave him a long look through the twilight . "
122703	122704	122700	122700	I	0	" "
122718	122726	122711	122711	you	3209	" his father rejoined with a smile . "
122753	122759	122761	122761	I	0	" His father smiled again . "
122771	122880	122883	122883	him	3081	" Dallas looked at him again , and then , with an incredulous gesture , passed out of sight under the vaulted doorway . Archer sat down on the bench and continued to gaze at the awninged balcony . He calculated the time it would take his son to be carried up in the lift to the fifth floor , to ring the bell , and be admitted to the hall , and then ushered into the drawing - room . He pictured Dallas entering that room with his quick assured step and his delightful smile , and wondered if the people were right who said that his boy "
122885	122968	122883	122883	him	3081	" Then he tried to see the persons already in the room -- for probably at that sociable hour there would be more than one -- and among them a dark lady , pale and dark , who would look up quickly , half rise , and hold out a long thin hand with three rings on it .... He thought she would be sitting in a sofa - corner near the fire , with azaleas banked behind her on a table . "
