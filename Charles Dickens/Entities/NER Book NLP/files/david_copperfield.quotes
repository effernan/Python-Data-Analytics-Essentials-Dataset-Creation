155	482	131	132	the reader	673	’ imaginative task ; or how an Author feels as if he were dismissing some portion of himself into the shadowy world , when a crowd of the creatures of his brain are going from him for ever . Yet , I have nothing else to tell ; unless , indeed , I were to confess ( which might be of less moment still ) that no one can ever believe this Narrative , in the reading , more than I have believed it in the writing . Instead of looking back , therefore , I will look forward . I can not close this Volume more agreeably to myself , than with a hopeful glance towards the time when I shall again put forth my two green leaves once a month , and with a faithful remembrance of the genial sun and showers that have fallen on these leaves of David Copperfield , and made me happy . London , _ October _ , 1850 . PREFACE TO THE CHARLES DICKENS EDITION I REMARKED in the original Preface to this Book , that I did not find it easy to get sufficiently far away from it , in the first sensations of having finished it , to refer to it with the composure which this formal heading would seem to require . My interest in it was so recent and strong , and my mind was so divided between pleasure and regret -- pleasure in the achievement of a long design , regret in the separation from many companions -- that I was in danger of wearying the reader with personal confidences and private emotions . Besides which , all that I could have said of the Story to any purpose , I had endeavoured to say in it . It would concern the reader little , perhaps , to know how sorrowfully the pen is laid down at the close of a two - years ’

3119	3152	3116	3117	my mother	740	‘ We thought -- Mr. Copperfield thought -- it was quite a large rookery ; but the nests were very old ones , and the birds have deserted them a long while . ’

3164	3199	3161	3162	Miss Betsey	228	‘ David Copperfield from head to foot ! Calls a house a rookery when there ’s not a rook near it , and takes the birds on trust , because he sees the nests ! ’

3587	3613	3580	3581	Miss Betsey	228	‘ Do you mean to say , child , that any human being has gone into a Christian church , and got herself named Peggotty ? ’
3614	3620	3622	3623	my mother	740	‘ It ’s her surname , ’
3627	3645	3622	3623	my mother	740	‘ Mr. Copperfield called her by it , because her Christian name was the same as mine . ’

3661	3675	3653	3654	Miss Betsey	228	‘ Tea . Your mistress is a little unwell . Do n’t dawdle . ’
3763	3773	3775	3776	Miss Betsey	228	‘ You were speaking about its being a girl , ’
3778	3812	3775	3776	Miss Betsey	228	‘ I have no doubt it will be a girl . I have a presentiment that it must be a girl . Now child , from the moment of the birth of this girl-- ’
3813	3817	3818	3819	my mother	740	‘ Perhaps boy , ’
3827	3842	3844	3845	Miss Betsey	228	‘ I tell you I have a presentiment that it must be a girl , ’
3847	3940	3844	3845	Miss Betsey	228	‘ Do n’t contradict . From the moment of this girl ’s birth , child , I intend to be her friend . I intend to be her godmother , and I beg you ’ll call her Betsey Trotwood Copperfield . There must be no mistakes in life with THIS Betsey Trotwood . There must be no trifling with HER affections , poor dear . She must be well brought up , and well guarded from reposing any foolish confidences where they are not deserved . I must make that MY care . ’
4032	4042	4044	4045	Miss Betsey	228	‘ And was David good to you , child ? ’
4067	4073	4082	4083	my mother	740	‘ Were you comfortable together ? ’
4074	4080	4082	4083	my mother	740	‘ We were very happy , ’
4085	4095	4082	4083	my mother	740	‘ Mr. Copperfield was only too good to me . ’
4096	4106	4082	4083	my mother	740	‘ What , he spoilt you , I suppose ? ’
4111	4134	4136	4137	my mother	740	‘ For being quite alone and dependent on myself in this rough world again , yes , I fear he did indeed , ’
4139	4146	4148	4149	Miss Betsey	228	‘ Well ! Do n’t cry ! ’
4151	4185	4148	4149	Miss Betsey	228	‘ You were not equally matched , child -- if any two people can be equally matched -- and so I asked the question . You were an orphan , were n’t you ? ’
4186	4189	4259	4260	my mother	740	‘ Yes . ’
4190	4195	4259	4260	my mother	740	‘ And a governess ? ’
4196	4257	4259	4260	my mother	740	‘ I was nursery - governess in a family where Mr. Copperfield came to visit . Mr. Copperfield was very kind to me , and took a great deal of notice of me , and paid me a good deal of attention , and at last proposed to me . And I accepted him . And so we were married , ’
4263	4269	4259	4260	my mother	740	‘ Ha ! Poor Baby ! ’
4283	4289	4259	4260	my mother	740	‘ Do you know anything ? ’
4290	4298	4300	4301	my mother	740	‘ I beg your pardon , ma’am , ’
4303	4311	4313	4314	Miss Betsey	228	‘ About keeping house , for instance , ’
4316	4323	4313	4314	Miss Betsey	228	‘ Not much , I fear , ’
4328	4343	4356	4357	Miss Betsey	228	‘ Not so much as I could wish . But Mr. Copperfield was teaching me-- ’
4345	4353	4356	4357	Miss Betsey	228	‘ Much he knew about it himself ! ’
4403	4408	4410	4411	Miss Betsey	228	‘ Well , well ! ’
4430	4445	4425	4426	Mr. Copperfield	232	’ cried my mother in another burst of distress , and breaking down again . ‘
4450	4455	4425	4426	Mr. Copperfield	232	’ said Miss Betsey . ‘
4462	4506	4508	4509	my mother	740	’ --‘And I am sure we never had a word of difference respecting it , except when Mr. Copperfield objected to my threes and fives being too much like each other , or to my putting curly tails to my sevens and nines , ’
4519	4526	4528	4529	Miss Betsey	228	‘ You ’ll make yourself ill , ’
4531	4558	4528	4529	Miss Betsey	228	‘ and you know that will not be good either for you or for my god - daughter . Come ! You must n’t do it ! ’
4593	4596	4598	4598	she	228	‘ Ha ! ’
4607	4622	4624	4624	she	228	‘ David had bought an annuity for himself with his money , I know , ’
4630	4638	4624	4624	she	228	‘ What did he do for you ? ’
4639	4643	4645	4646	my mother	740	‘ Mr. Copperfield , ’
4653	4672	4645	4646	my mother	740	‘ was so considerate and good as to secure the reversion of a part of it to me . ’
4673	4677	4679	4680	Miss Betsey	228	‘ How much ? ’
4682	4691	4693	4694	my mother	740	‘ A hundred and five pounds a year , ’
4696	4703	4705	4706	my aunt	731	‘ He might have done worse , ’
4852	4888	4891	4891	her	837	’ cotton . Peggotty knowing nothing about her , and my mother saying nothing about her , she was quite a mystery in the parlour ; and the fact of her having a magazine of jewellers ’
5144	5155	5124	5124	his	237	’ cotton , as he softly touched his left ear : ‘
5162	5163	5124	5124	his	237	’ ‘
5166	5217	5124	5124	his	237	’ replied my aunt , pulling the cotton out of one ear like a cork . Mr. Chillip was so alarmed by her abruptness -- as he told my mother afterwards -- that it was a mercy he did n’t lose his presence of mind . But he repeated sweetly : ‘
5224	5225	5124	5124	his	237	’ ‘
5228	5286	5124	5124	his	237	’ replied my aunt , and corked herself again , at one blow . Mr. Chillip could do nothing after this , but sit and look at her feebly , as she sat and looked at the fire , until he was called upstairs again . After some quarter of an hour ’s absence , he returned . ‘
5289	5305	5124	5124	his	237	’ said my aunt , taking the cotton out of the ear nearest to him . ‘
5310	5315	5308	5308	ma’am	8495	’ returned Mr. Chillip , ‘
5326	5327	5324	5324	ma’am	8495	’ ‘
5334	5422	5324	5324	ma’am	8495	’ said my aunt , with a perfect shake on the contemptuous interjection . And corked herself as before . Really -- really -- as Mr. Chillip told my mother , he was almost shocked ; speaking in a professional point of view alone , he was almost shocked . But he sat and looked at her , notwithstanding , for nearly two hours , as she sat looking at the fire , until he was again called out . After another absence , he again returned . ‘
5425	5439	5324	5324	ma’am	8495	’ said my aunt , taking out the cotton on that side again . ‘
5444	5449	5450	5450	we	848	’ returned Mr. Chillip , ‘
5460	5461	5462	5462	Ya	8495	’ ‘
5468	5790	5462	5462	Ya	8495	’ said my aunt . With such a snarl at him , that Mr. Chillip absolutely could not bear it . It was really calculated to break his spirit , he said afterwards . He preferred to go and sit upon the stairs , in the dark and a strong draught , until he was again sent for . Ham Peggotty , who went to the national school , and was a very dragon at his catechism , and who may therefore be regarded as a credible witness , reported next day , that happening to peep in at the parlour - door an hour after this , he was instantly descried by Miss Betsey , then walking to and fro in a state of agitation , and pounced upon before he could make his escape . That there were now occasional sounds of feet and voices overhead which he inferred the cotton did not exclude , from the circumstance of his evidently being clutched by the lady as a victim on whom to expend her superabundant agitation when the sounds were loudest . That , marching him constantly up and down by the collar ( as if he had been taking too much laudanum ) , she , at those times , shook him , rumpled his hair , made light of his linen , stopped his ears as if she confounded them with her own , and otherwise tousled and maltreated him . This was in part confirmed by his aunt , who saw him at half past twelve o’clock , soon after his release , and affirmed that he was then as red as I was . The mild Mr. Chillip could not possibly bear malice at such a time , if at any time . He sidled into the parlour as soon as he was at liberty , and said to my aunt in his meekest manner : ‘
5802	5803	5795	5795	I	0	’ ‘
5807	5848	5795	5795	I	0	’ said my aunt , sharply . Mr. Chillip was fluttered again , by the extreme severity of my aunt ’s manner ; so he made her a little bow and gave her a little smile , to mollify her . ‘
5859	5866	5856	5856	he	853	’ cried my aunt , impatiently . ‘
5872	5873	5856	5856	he	853	’ ‘
5881	5891	5877	5878	my dear	854	’ said Mr. Chillip , in his softest accents . ‘
5906	5953	5956	5956	ma’am	8495	’ It has since been considered almost a miracle that my aunt did n’t shake him , and shake what he had to say , out of him . She only shook her own head at him , but in a way that made him quail . ‘
5958	5970	5971	5971	I	0	’ resumed Mr. Chillip , as soon as he had courage , ‘
5989	6013	5983	5983	ma’am	8495	’ During the five minutes or so that Mr. Chillip devoted to the delivery of this oration , my aunt eyed him narrowly . ‘
6018	6036	5983	5983	ma’am	8495	’ said my aunt , folding her arms with her bonnet still tied on one of them . ‘
6051	6056	6041	6041	she	858	’ returned Mr. Chillip . ‘
6096	6097	6099	6099	SHE	858	’ ‘
6105	6134	6103	6103	SHE	858	’ said my aunt , sharply . Mr. Chillip laid his head a little more on one side , and looked at my aunt like an amiable bird . ‘
6138	6143	6103	6103	SHE	858	’ said my aunt . ‘
6148	6149	6150	6150	Ma’am	238	’ ‘
6152	6157	6150	6150	Ma’am	238	’ returned Mr. Chillip , ‘
6169	6631	6166	6167	a boy	864	’ My aunt said never a word , but took her bonnet by the strings , in the manner of a sling , aimed a blow at Mr. Chillip ’s head with it , put it on bent , walked out , and never came back . She vanished like a discontented fairy ; or like one of those supernatural beings , whom it was popularly supposed I was entitled to see ; and never came back any more . No . I lay in my basket , and my mother lay in her bed ; but Betsey Trotwood Copperfield was for ever in the land of dreams and shadows , the tremendous region whence I had so lately travelled ; and the light upon the window of our room shone out upon the earthly bourne of all such travellers , and the mound above the ashes and the dust that once was he , without whom I had never been . CHAPTER 2 . I OBSERVE The first objects that assume a distinct presence before me , as I look far back , into the blank of my infancy , are my mother with her pretty hair and youthful shape , and Peggotty with no shape at all , and eyes so dark that they seemed to darken their whole neighbourhood in her face , and cheeks and arms so hard and red that I wondered the birds did n’t peck her in preference to apples . I believe I can remember these two at a little distance apart , dwarfed to my sight by stooping down or kneeling on the floor , and I going unsteadily from the one to the other . I have an impression on my mind which I can not distinguish from actual remembrance , of the touch of Peggotty ’s forefinger as she used to hold it out to me , and of its being roughened by needlework , like a pocket nutmeg - grater . This may be fancy , though I think the memory of most of us can go farther back into such times than many of us suppose ; just as I believe the power of observation in numbers of very young children to be quite wonderful for its closeness and accuracy . Indeed , I think that most grown men who are remarkable in this respect , may with greater propriety be said not to have lost the faculty , than to have acquired it ; the rather , as I generally observe such men to retain a certain freshness , and gentleness , and capacity of being pleased , which are also an inheritance they have preserved from their childhood . I might have a misgiving that I am ‘
6633	7302	6150	6150	Ma’am	238	’ in stopping to say this , but that it brings me to remark that I build these conclusions , in part upon my own experience of myself ; and if it should appear from anything I may set down in this narrative that I was a child of close observation , or that as a man I have a strong memory of my childhood , I undoubtedly lay claim to both of these characteristics . Looking back , as I was saying , into the blank of my infancy , the first objects I can remember as standing out by themselves from a confusion of things , are my mother and Peggotty . What else do I remember ? Let me see . There comes out of the cloud , our house -- not new to me , but quite familiar , in its earliest remembrance . On the ground - floor is Peggotty ’s kitchen , opening into a back yard ; with a pigeon - house on a pole , in the centre , without any pigeons in it ; a great dog - kennel in a corner , without any dog ; and a quantity of fowls that look terribly tall to me , walking about , in a menacing and ferocious manner . There is one cock who gets upon a post to crow , and seems to take particular notice of me as I look at him through the kitchen window , who makes me shiver , he is so fierce . Of the geese outside the side - gate who come waddling after me with their long necks stretched out when I go that way , I dream at night : as a man environed by wild beasts might dream of lions . Here is a long passage -- what an enormous perspective I make of it!--leading from Peggotty ’s kitchen to the front door . A dark store - room opens out of it , and that is a place to be run past at night ; for I do n’t know what may be among those tubs and jars and old tea - chests , when there is nobody in there with a dimly - burning light , letting a mouldy air come out of the door , in which there is the smell of soap , pickles , pepper , candles , and coffee , all at one whiff . Then there are the two parlours : the parlour in which we sit of an evening , my mother and I and Peggotty -- for Peggotty is quite our companion , when her work is done and we are alone -- and the best parlour where we sit on a Sunday ; grandly , but not so comfortably . There is something of a doleful air about that room to me , for Peggotty has told me -- I do n’t know when , but apparently ages ago -- about my father ’s funeral , and the company having their black cloaks put on . One Sunday night my mother reads to Peggotty and me in there , how Lazarus was raised up from the dead . And I am so frightened that they are afterwards obliged to take me out of bed , and show me the quiet churchyard out of the bedroom window , with the dead all lying in their graves at rest , below the solemn moon . There is nothing half so green that I know anywhere , as the grass of that churchyard ; nothing half so shady as its trees ; nothing half so quiet as its tombstones . The sheep are feeding there , when I kneel up , early in the morning , in my little bed in a closet within my mother ’s room , to look out at it ; and I see the red light shining on the sun - dial , and think within myself , ‘
7321	8320	8321	8321	Peggotty	234	’ Here is our pew in the church . What a high - backed pew ! With a window near it , out of which our house can be seen , and IS seen many times during the morning ’s service , by Peggotty , who likes to make herself as sure as she can that it ’s not being robbed , or is not in flames . But though Peggotty ’s eye wanders , she is much offended if mine does , and frowns to me , as I stand upon the seat , that I am to look at the clergyman . But I ca n’t always look at him -- I know him without that white thing on , and I am afraid of his wondering why I stare so , and perhaps stopping the service to inquire -- and what am I to do ? It ’s a dreadful thing to gape , but I must do something . I look at my mother , but she pretends not to see me . I look at a boy in the aisle , and he makes faces at me . I look at the sunlight coming in at the open door through the porch , and there I see a stray sheep -- I do n’t mean a sinner , but mutton -- half making up his mind to come into the church . I feel that if I looked at him any longer , I might be tempted to say something out loud ; and what would become of me then ! I look up at the monumental tablets on the wall , and try to think of Mr. Bodgers late of this parish , and what the feelings of Mrs. Bodgers must have been , when affliction sore , long time Mr. Bodgers bore , and physicians were in vain . I wonder whether they called in Mr. Chillip , and he was in vain ; and if so , how he likes to be reminded of it once a week . I look from Mr. Chillip , in his Sunday neckcloth , to the pulpit ; and think what a good place it would be to play in , and what a castle it would make , with another boy coming up the stairs to attack it , and having the velvet cushion with the tassels thrown down on his head . In time my eyes gradually shut up ; and , from seeming to hear the clergyman singing a drowsy song in the heat , I hear nothing , until I fall off the seat with a crash , and am taken out , more dead than alive , by Peggotty . And now I see the outside of our house , with the latticed bedroom - windows standing open to let in the sweet - smelling air , and the ragged old rooks’-nests still dangling in the elm - trees at the bottom of the front garden . Now I am in the garden at the back , beyond the yard where the empty pigeon - house and dog - kennel are -- a very preserve of butterflies , as I remember it , with a high fence , and a gate and padlock ; where the fruit clusters on the trees , riper and richer than fruit has ever been since , in any other garden , and where my mother gathers some in a basket , while I stand by , bolting furtive gooseberries , and trying to look unmoved . A great wind rises , and the summer is gone in a moment . We are playing in the winter twilight , dancing about the parlour . When my mother is out of breath and rests herself in an elbow - chair , I watch her winding her bright curls round her fingers , and straitening her waist , and nobody knows better than I do that she likes to look so well , and is proud of being so pretty . That is among my very earliest impressions . That , and a sense that we were both a little afraid of Peggotty , and submitted ourselves in most things to her direction , were among the first opinions -- if they may be so called -- that I ever derived from what I saw . Peggotty and I were sitting one night by the parlour fire , alone . I had been reading to Peggotty about crocodiles . I must have read very perspicuously , or the poor soul must have been deeply interested , for I remember she had a cloudy impression , after I had done , that they were a sort of vegetable . I was tired of reading , and dead sleepy ; but having leave , as a high treat , to sit up until my mother came home from spending the evening at a neighbour ’s , I would rather have died upon my post ( of course ) than have gone to bed . I had reached that stage of sleepiness when Peggotty seemed to swell and grow immensely large . I propped my eyelids open with my two forefingers , and looked perseveringly at her as she sat at work ; at the little bit of wax - candle she kept for her thread -- how old it looked , being so wrinkled in all directions!--at the little house with a thatched roof , where the yard - measure lived ; at her work - box with a sliding lid , with a view of St. Paul ’s Cathedral ( with a pink dome ) painted on the top ; at the brass thimble on her finger ; at herself , whom I thought lovely . I felt so sleepy , that I knew if I lost sight of anything for a moment , I was gone . ‘
8323	8329	8331	8331	you	234	’ says I , suddenly , ‘
8335	8336	8337	8337	Lord	865	’ ‘
8342	8346	8339	8340	Master Davy	232	’ replied Peggotty . ‘
8355	8393	8339	8340	Master Davy	232	’ She answered with such a start , that it quite awoke me . And then she stopped in her work , and looked at me , with her needle drawn out to its thread ’s length . ‘
8402	8405	8396	8396	you	234	’ says I. ‘
8416	8503	8504	8504	Me	0	’ I thought her in a different style from my mother , certainly ; but of another school of beauty , I considered her a perfect example . There was a red velvet footstool in the best parlour , on which my mother had painted a nosegay . The ground - work of that stool , and Peggotty ’s complexion appeared to me to be one and the same thing . The stool was smooth , and Peggotty was rough , but that made no difference . ‘
8509	8513	8514	8514	Lawk	243	’ said Peggotty . ‘
8529	8530	8531	8531	I	0	’ ‘
8551	8552	8547	8547	you	234	’ ‘
8556	8565	8547	8547	you	234	’ says Peggotty , with the promptest decision . ‘
8592	8593	8594	8594	YOU	234	’ ‘
8597	8601	8594	8594	YOU	234	’ says Peggotty , ‘
8616	8617	8594	8594	YOU	234	’ ‘
8626	8647	8621	8621	your	234	’ said I. I asked her , and looked curiously at her , because she looked so curiously at me . ‘
8652	8673	8648	8648	My	0	’ said Peggotty , taking her eyes from me , after a little indecision and going on with her work , ‘
8702	8703	8704	8704	You	234	’ ‘
8716	8840	8714	8714	you	234	’ said I , after sitting quiet for a minute . I really thought she was , she had been so short with me ; but I was quite mistaken : for she laid aside her work ( which was a stocking of her own ) , and opening her arms wide , took my curly head within them , and gave it a good squeeze . I know it was a good squeeze , because , being very plump , whenever she made any little exertion after she was dressed , some of the buttons on the back of her gown flew off . And I recollect two bursting to the opposite side of the parlour , while she was hugging me . ‘
8851	8865	8843	8843	me	0	’ said Peggotty , who was not quite right in the name yet , ‘
8873	9136	8867	8867	I	0	’ I could n’t quite understand why Peggotty looked so queer , or why she was so ready to go back to the crocodiles . However , we returned to those monsters , with fresh wakefulness on my part , and we left their eggs in the sand for the sun to hatch ; and we ran away from them , and baffled them by constantly turning , which they were unable to do quickly , on account of their unwieldy make ; and we went into the water after them , as natives , and put sharp pieces of timber down their throats ; and in short we ran the whole crocodile gauntlet . I did , at least ; but I had my doubts of Peggotty , who was thoughtfully sticking her needle into various parts of her face and arms , all the time . We had exhausted the crocodiles , and begun with the alligators , when the garden - bell rang . We went out to the door ; and there was my mother , looking unusually pretty , I thought , and with her a gentleman with beautiful black hair and whiskers , who had walked home with us from church last Sunday . As my mother stooped down on the threshold to take me in her arms and kiss me , the gentleman said I was a more highly privileged little fellow than a monarch -- or something like that ; for my later understanding comes , I am sensible , to my aid here . ‘
9142	9202	9205	9205	Davy	232	’ I asked him , over her shoulder . He patted me on the head ; but somehow , I did n’t like him or his deep voice , and I was jealous that his hand should touch my mother ’s in touching me -- which it did . I put it away , as well as I could . ‘
9207	9212	9205	9205	Davy	232	’ remonstrated my mother . ‘
9216	9221	9205	9205	Davy	232	’ said the gentleman . ‘
9230	9308	9205	9205	Davy	232	’ I never saw such a beautiful colour on my mother ’s face before . She gently chid me for being rude ; and , keeping me close to her shawl , turned to thank the gentleman for taking so much trouble as to bring her home . She put out her hand to him as she spoke , and , as he met it with his own , she glanced , I thought , at me . ‘
9321	9342	9310	9310	us	874	’ said the gentleman , when he had bent his head -- I saw him!--over my mother ’s little glove . ‘
9346	9349	9205	9205	Davy	232	’ said I. ‘
9362	9369	9205	9205	Davy	232	’ said the gentleman , laughing . ‘
9373	9391	9205	9205	Davy	232	’ My right hand was in my mother ’s left , so I gave him the other . ‘
9402	9564	9566	9566	Peggotty	234	’ laughed the gentleman . My mother drew my right hand forward , but I was resolved , for my former reason , not to give it him , and I did not . I gave him the other , and he shook it heartily , and said I was a brave fellow , and went away . At this minute I see him turn round in the garden , and give us a last look with his ill - omened black eyes , before the door was shut . Peggotty , who had not said a word or moved a finger , secured the fastenings instantly , and we all went into the parlour . My mother , contrary to her usual habit , instead of coming to the elbow - chair by the fire , remained at the other end of the room , and sat singing to herself . --‘Hope you have had a pleasant evening , ma’am , ’
9588	9596	9598	9599	my mother	740	‘ Much obliged to you , Peggotty , ’
9606	9615	9598	9599	my mother	740	‘ I have had a VERY pleasant evening . ’
9616	9626	9628	9628	Peggotty	234	‘ A stranger or so makes an agreeable change , ’
9630	9638	9628	9628	Peggotty	234	‘ A very agreeable change , indeed , ’
9709	9724	9726	9726	Peggotty	234	‘ Not such a one as this , Mr. Copperfield would n’t have liked , ’
9728	9738	9726	9726	Peggotty	234	‘ That I say , and that I swear ! ’
9739	9743	9745	9746	my mother	740	‘ Good Heavens ! ’
9748	9792	9745	9746	my mother	740	‘ you ’ll drive me mad ! Was ever any poor girl so ill - used by her servants as I am ! Why do I do myself the injustice of calling myself a girl ? Have I never been married , Peggotty ? ’
9793	9801	9803	9803	Peggotty	234	‘ God knows you have , ma’am , ’
9805	9813	9815	9815	my	0	‘ Then , how can you dare , ’
9872	9873	9920	9920	she	246	’ ‘
9880	9884	9920	9920	she	246	’ returned Peggotty , ‘
9927	9935	9920	9920	she	246	‘ How can you be so aggravating , ’
9946	10078	9920	9920	she	246	‘ as to talk in such an unjust manner ! How can you go on as if it was all settled and arranged , Peggotty , when I tell you over and over again , you cruel thing , that beyond the commonest civilities nothing has passed ! You talk of admiration . What am I to do ? If people are so silly as to indulge the sentiment , is it my fault ? What am I to do , I ask you ? Would you wish me to shave my head and black my face , or disfigure myself with a burn , or a scald , or something of that sort ? I dare say you would , Peggotty . I dare say you ’d quite enjoy it . ’
10093	10099	10101	10102	my mother	740	‘ And my dear boy , ’
10119	10151	10101	10102	my mother	740	‘ my own little Davy ! Is it to be hinted to me that I am wanting in affection for my precious treasure , the dearest little fellow that ever was ! ’
10152	10163	10165	10165	Peggotty	234	‘ Nobody never went and hinted no such a thing , ’
10167	10173	10165	10165	Peggotty	234	‘ You did , Peggotty ! ’
10178	10257	10165	10165	Peggotty	234	‘ You know you did . What else was it possible to infer from what you said , you unkind creature , when you know as well as I do , that on his account only last quarter I would n’t buy myself a new parasol , though that old green one is frayed the whole way up , and the fringe is perfectly mangy ? You know it is , Peggotty . You ca n’t deny it . ’
10271	10340	10266	10266	her	740	‘ Am I a naughty mama to you , Davy ? Am I a nasty , cruel , selfish , bad mama ? Say I am , my child ; say “ yes ” , dear boy , and Peggotty will love you ; and Peggotty ’s love is a great deal better than mine , Davy . I do n’t love you at all , do I ? ’
10396	10398	10392	10392	I	0	‘ Beast ’
11554	11565	11532	11532	They	928	‘ Halloa , Murdstone ! We thought you were dead ! ’
11566	11570	11572	11573	Mr. Murdstone	247	‘ Not yet , ’
11575	11582	11586	11587	the gentlemen	931	‘ And who ’s this shaver ? ’
11594	11599	11586	11587	the gentlemen	931	‘ That ’s Davy , ’

11639	11645	11636	11637	the gentleman	8663	‘ The pretty little widow ? ’
11646	11649	11651	11652	Mr. Murdstone	247	‘ Quinion , ’
11654	11666	11651	11652	Mr. Murdstone	247	‘ take care , if you please . Somebody ’s sharp . ’
11667	11671	11673	11674	the gentleman	8663	‘ Who is ? ’
11689	11695	11697	11698	Mr. Murdstone	247	‘ Only Brooks of Sheffield , ’
11776	11794	11772	11772	Quinion	250	‘ And what is the opinion of Brooks of Sheffield , in reference to the projected business ? ’
11795	11811	11813	11814	Mr. Murdstone	247	‘ Why , I do n’t know that Brooks understands much about it at present , ’
11816	11827	11813	11814	Mr. Murdstone	247	‘ but he is not generally favourable , I believe . ’
11887	11894	11864	11864	he	250	‘ Confusion to Brooks of Sheffield ! ’

12694	12698	12699	12699	I	0	‘ “ Bewitching-- ” ’
12714	12720	12721	12721	she	740	‘ It was never bewitching , ’
12726	12743	12721	12721	she	740	‘ It never could have been bewitching , Davy . Now I know it was n’t ! ’
12744	12756	12757	12757	I	0	‘ Yes , it was . “ Bewitching Mrs. Copperfield ” , ’
12761	12768	12757	12757	I	0	‘ And , “ pretty . ” ’
12769	12782	12788	12788	her	740	‘ No , no , it was never pretty . Not pretty , ’
12795	12806	12788	12788	her	740	‘ Yes it was . “ Pretty little widow . ” ’
12807	12814	12822	12822	her	740	‘ What foolish , impudent creatures ! ’
12825	12835	12822	12822	her	740	‘ What ridiculous men ! An’t they ? Davy dear-- ’
12836	12841	12788	12788	her	740	‘ Well , Ma . ’
12842	12872	12873	12873	I	0	‘ Do n’t tell Peggotty ; she might be angry with them . I am dreadfully angry with them myself ; but I would rather Peggotty did n’t know . ’
13032	13063	13000	13000	her	970	‘ Master Davy , how should you like to go along with me and spend a fortnight at my brother ’s at Yarmouth ? Would n’t that be a treat ? ’
13064	13074	13075	13075	I	0	‘ Is your brother an agreeable man , Peggotty ? ’
13080	13090	13092	13092	Peggotty	234	‘ Oh , what an agreeable man he is ! ’
13099	13125	13092	13092	Peggotty	234	‘ Then there ’s the sea ; and the boats and ships ; and the fishermen ; and the beach ; and Am to play with-- ’
13176	13188	13190	13190	Peggotty	234	‘ Why then I ’ll as good as bet a guinea , ’
13197	13225	13190	13190	Peggotty	234	‘ that she ’ll let us go . I ’ll ask her , if you like , as soon as ever she comes home . There now ! ’
13226	13235	13302	13302	Peggotty	234	‘ But what ’s she to do while we ’re
13238	13254	13190	13190	Peggotty	234	’ said I , putting my small elbows on the table to argue the point . ‘
13262	13298	13299	13299	I	0	’ If Peggotty were looking for a hole , all of a sudden , in the heel of that stocking , it must have been a very little one indeed , and not worth darning . ‘
13314	13315	13309	13309	herself	970	’ ‘
13321	13332	13309	13309	herself	970	’ said Peggotty , looking at me again at last . ‘
13361	13960	13350	13351	Mrs. Grayper	255	’ Oh ! If that was it , I was quite ready to go . I waited , in the utmost impatience , until my mother came home from Mrs. Grayper ’s ( for it was that identical neighbour ) , to ascertain if we could get leave to carry out this great idea . Without being nearly so much surprised as I had expected , my mother entered into it readily ; and it was all arranged that night , and my board and lodging during the visit were to be paid for . The day soon came for our going . It was such an early day that it came soon , even to me , who was in a fever of expectation , and half afraid that an earthquake or a fiery mountain , or some other great convulsion of nature , might interpose to stop the expedition . We were to go in a carrier ’s cart , which departed in the morning after breakfast . I would have given any money to have been allowed to wrap myself up over - night , and sleep in my hat and boots . It touches me nearly now , although I tell it lightly , to recollect how eager I was to leave my happy home ; to think how little I suspected what I did leave for ever . I am glad to recollect that when the carrier ’s cart was at the gate , and my mother stood there kissing me , a grateful fondness for her and for the old place I had never turned my back upon before , made me cry . I am glad to know that my mother cried too , and that I felt her heart beat against mine . I am glad to recollect that when the carrier began to move , my mother ran out at the gate , and called to him to stop , that she might kiss me once more . I am glad to dwell upon the earnestness and love with which she lifted up her face to mine , and did so . As we left her standing in the road , Mr. Murdstone came up to where she was , and seemed to expostulate with her for being so moved . I was looking back round the awning of the cart , and wondered what business it was of his . Peggotty , who was also looking back on the other side , seemed anything but satisfied ; as the face she brought back in the cart denoted . I sat looking at Peggotty for some time , in a reverie on this supposititious case : whether , if she were employed to lose me like the boy in the fairy tale , I should be able to track my way home again by the buttons she would shed . CHAPTER 3 . I HAVE A CHANGE The carrier ’s horse was the laziest horse in the world , I should hope , and shuffled along , with his head down , as if he liked to keep people waiting to whom the packages were directed . I fancied , indeed , that he sometimes chuckled audibly over this reflection , but the carrier said he was only troubled with a cough . The carrier had a way of keeping his head down , like his horse , and of drooping sleepily forward as he drove , with one of his arms on each of his knees . I say ‘
13962	14442	14886	14887	Mas’r Davy	256	’ , but it struck me that the cart would have gone to Yarmouth quite as well without him , for the horse did all that ; and as to conversation , he had no idea of it but whistling . Peggotty had a basket of refreshments on her knee , which would have lasted us out handsomely , if we had been going to London by the same conveyance . We ate a good deal , and slept a good deal . Peggotty always went to sleep with her chin upon the handle of the basket , her hold of which never relaxed ; and I could not have believed unless I had heard her do it , that one defenceless woman could have snored so much . We made so many deviations up and down lanes , and were such a long time delivering a bedstead at a public - house , and calling at other places , that I was quite tired , and very glad , when we saw Yarmouth . It looked rather spongy and soppy , I thought , as I carried my eye over the great dull waste that lay across the river ; and I could not help wondering , if the world were really as round as my geography book said , how any part of it came to be so flat . But I reflected that Yarmouth might be situated at one of the poles ; which would account for it . As we drew a little nearer , and saw the whole adjacent prospect lying a straight low line under the sky , I hinted to Peggotty that a mound or so might have improved it ; and also that if the land had been a little more separated from the sea , and the town and the tide had not been quite so much mixed up , like toast and water , it would have been nicer . But Peggotty said , with greater emphasis than usual , that we must take things as we found them , and that , for her part , she was proud to call herself a Yarmouth Bloater . When we got into the street ( which was strange enough to me ) and smelt the fish , and pitch , and oakum , and tar , and saw the sailors walking about , and the carts jingling up and down over the stones , I felt that I had done so busy a place an injustice ; and said as much to Peggotty , who heard my expressions of delight with great complacency , and told me it was well known ( I suppose to those who had the good fortune to be born Bloaters ) that Yarmouth was , upon the whole , the finest place in the universe . ‘
14448	14452	13350	13351	Mrs. Grayper	255	’ screamed Peggotty , ‘
14458	14709	14712	14712	shipwrights	973	’ He was waiting for us , in fact , at the public - house ; and asked me how I found myself , like an old acquaintance . I did not feel , at first , that I knew him as well as he knew me , because he had never come to our house since the night I was born , and naturally he had the advantage of me . But our intimacy was much advanced by his taking me on his back to carry me home . He was , now , a huge , strong fellow of six feet high , broad in proportion , and round - shouldered ; but with a simpering boy ’s face and curly light hair that gave him quite a sheepish look . He was dressed in a canvas jacket , and a pair of such very stiff trousers that they would have stood quite as well alone , without any legs in them . And you could n’t so properly have said he wore a hat , as that he was covered in a - top , like an old building , with something pitchy . Ham carrying me on his back and a small box of ours under his arm , and Peggotty carrying another small box of ours , we turned down lanes bestrewn with bits of chips and little hillocks of sand , and went past gas - works , rope - walks , boat - builders ’
14713	14719	14712	14712	shipwrights	973	’ yards , ship - breakers ’
14723	14727	14712	14712	shipwrights	973	’ yards , riggers ’
14731	14762	14712	14712	shipwrights	973	’ forges , and a great litter of such places , until we came out upon the dull waste I had already seen at a distance ; when Ham said , ‘
14771	14864	14768	14769	Mas’r Davy	256	’ I looked in all directions , as far as I could stare over the wilderness , and away at the sea , and away at the river , but no house could I make out . There was a black barge , or some other kind of superannuated boat , not far off , high and dry on the ground , with an iron funnel sticking out of it for a chimney and smoking very cosily ; but nothing else in the way of a habitation that was visible to me . ‘
14870	14873	14768	14769	Mas’r Davy	256	’ said I. ‘
14880	14881	14768	14769	Mas’r Davy	256	’ ‘
14889	15234	14886	14887	Mas’r Davy	256	’ returned Ham . If it had been Aladdin ’s palace , roc ’s egg and all , I suppose I could not have been more charmed with the romantic idea of living in it . There was a delightful door cut in the side , and it was roofed in , and there were little windows in it ; but the wonderful charm of it was , that it was a real boat which had no doubt been upon the water hundreds of times , and which had never been intended to be lived in , on dry land . That was the captivation of it to me . If it had ever been meant to be lived in , I might have thought it small , or inconvenient , or lonely ; but never having been designed for any such use , it became a perfect abode . It was beautifully clean inside , and as tidy as possible . There was a table , and a Dutch clock , and a chest of drawers , and on the chest of drawers there was a tea - tray with a painting on it of a lady with a parasol , taking a walk with a military - looking child who was trundling a hoop . The tray was kept from tumbling down , by a bible ; and the tray , if it had tumbled down , would have smashed a quantity of cups and saucers and a teapot that were grouped around the book . On the walls there were some common coloured pictures , framed and glazed , of scripture subjects ; such as I have never seen since in the hands of pedlars , without seeing the whole interior of Peggotty ’s brother ’s house again , at one view . Abraham in red going to sacrifice Isaac in blue , and Daniel in yellow cast into a den of green lions , were the most prominent of these . Over the little mantelshelf , was a picture of the ‘
15237	15712	15713	15713	Lass	977	’ lugger , built at Sunderland , with a real little wooden stern stuck on to it ; a work of art , combining composition with carpentry , which I considered to be one of the most enviable possessions that the world could afford . There were some hooks in the beams of the ceiling , the use of which I did not divine then ; and some lockers and boxes and conveniences of that sort , which served for seats and eked out the chairs . All this I saw in the first glance after I crossed the threshold -- child - like , according to my theory -- and then Peggotty opened a little door and showed me my bedroom . It was the completest and most desirable bedroom ever seen -- in the stern of the vessel ; with a little window , where the rudder used to go through ; a little looking - glass , just the right height for me , nailed against the wall , and framed with oyster - shells ; a little bed , which there was just room enough to get into ; and a nosegay of seaweed in a blue mug on the table . The walls were whitewashed as white as milk , and the patchwork counterpane made my eyes quite ache with its brightness . One thing I particularly noticed in this delightful house , was the smell of fish ; which was so searching , that when I took out my pocket - handkerchief to wipe my nose , I found it smelt exactly as if it had wrapped up a lobster . On my imparting this discovery in confidence to Peggotty , she informed me that her brother dealt in lobsters , crabs , and crawfish ; and I afterwards found that a heap of these creatures , in a state of wonderful conglomeration with one another , and never leaving off pinching whatever they laid hold of , were usually to be found in a little wooden outhouse where the pots and kettles were kept . We were welcomed by a very civil woman in a white apron , whom I had seen curtseying at the door when I was on Ham ’s back , about a quarter of a mile off . Likewise by a most beautiful little girl ( or I thought her so ) with a necklace of blue beads on , who would n’t let me kiss her when I offered to , but ran away and hid herself . By and by , when we had dined in a sumptuous manner off boiled dabs , melted butter , and potatoes , with a chop for me , a hairy man with a very good - natured face came home . As he called Peggotty ‘
15714	15766	15780	15780	You	978	’ , and gave her a hearty smack on the cheek , I had no doubt , from the general propriety of her conduct , that he was her brother ; and so he turned out -- being presently introduced to me as Mr. Peggotty , the master of the house . ‘
15774	15779	15772	15772	sir	979	’ said Mr. Peggotty . ‘
15795	15816	15789	15789	you	978	’ I thanked him , and replied that I was sure I should be happy in such a delightful place . ‘
15824	15829	15822	15822	sir	979	’ said Mr. Peggotty . ‘
15837	15870	15831	15831	you	978	’ I gave Mr. Peggotty to understand that she was as jolly as I could wish , and that she desired her compliments -- which was a polite fiction on my part . ‘
15872	15879	15822	15822	sir	979	’m much obleeged to her , I ’m
15882	15887	15822	15822	sir	979	’ said Mr. Peggotty . ‘
15903	15906	15907	15907	her	982	‘ long wi ’
15909	15915	15917	15917	Ham	236	’ nodding at his sister , ‘
15931	15960	15920	15921	little Em’ly	985	’ Having done the honours of his house in this hospitable manner , Mr. Peggotty went out to wash himself in a kettleful of hot water , remarking that ‘
15968	16259	16260	16261	Mr. Peggotty	234	’ . He soon returned , greatly improved in appearance ; but so rubicund , that I could n’t help thinking his face had this in common with the lobsters , crabs , and crawfish,--that it went into the hot water very black , and came out very red . After tea , when the door was shut and all was made snug ( the nights being cold and misty now ) , it seemed to me the most delicious retreat that the imagination of man could conceive . To hear the wind getting up out at sea , to know that the fog was creeping over the desolate flat outside , and to look at the fire , and think that there was no house near but this one , and this one a boat , was like enchantment . Little Em’ly had overcome her shyness , and was sitting by my side upon the lowest and least of the lockers , which was just large enough for us two , and just fitted into the chimney corner . Mrs. Peggotty with the white apron , was knitting on the opposite side of the fire . Peggotty at her needlework was as much at home with St. Paul ’s and the bit of wax - candle , as if they had never known any other roof . Ham , who had been giving me my first lesson in all - fours , was trying to recollect a scheme of telling fortunes with the dirty cards , and was printing off fishy impressions of his thumb on all the cards he turned . Mr. Peggotty was smoking his pipe . I felt it was a time for conversation and confidence . ‘
16263	16266	16267	16267	Sir	979	’ says I. ‘
16269	16273	16267	16267	Sir	979	’ says he . ‘
16293	16307	16275	16275	you	979	’ Mr. Peggotty seemed to think it a deep idea , but answered : ‘
16319	16320	16312	16312	I	0	’ ‘
16329	16344	16312	16312	I	0	’ said I , putting question number two of the catechism to Mr. Peggotty . ‘
16355	16360	16353	16353	him	988	’ said Mr. Peggotty . ‘
16368	16369	16363	16363	you	979	’ ‘
16377	16382	16372	16372	Joe	264	’ said Mr. Peggotty . ‘
16388	16397	16385	16386	Mr. Peggotty	234	’ I hinted , after a respectful pause . ‘
16400	16456	16398	16398	Drowndead	265	’ said Mr. Peggotty . I was very much surprised that Mr. Peggotty was not Ham ’s father , and began to wonder whether I was mistaken about his relationship to anybody else there . I was so curious to know , that I made up my mind to have it out with Mr. Peggotty . ‘
16460	16468	16457	16458	Little Em’ly	262	’ I said , glancing at her . ‘
16481	16482	16485	16485	sir	979	’ ‘
16500	16507	16487	16492	My brother - in - law	998	’ I could n’t help it . ‘
16513	16522	16523	16523	Drowndead	265	’ I hinted , after another respectful silence . ‘
16525	16562	16523	16523	Drowndead	265	’ said Mr. Peggotty . I felt the difficulty of resuming the subject , but had not got to the bottom of it yet , and must get to the bottom somehow . So I said : ‘
16572	16573	16569	16570	Mr. Peggotty	234	’ ‘
16578	16586	16587	16587	I	0	’ he answered with a short laugh . ‘

16593	16597	16598	16598	I	0	‘ A bachelor ! ’
16603	16613	16598	16598	I	0	‘ Why , who ’s that , Mr. Peggotty ? ’
16625	16631	16633	16634	Mr. Peggotty	234	‘ That ’s Missis Gummidge , ’
16636	16642	16633	16634	Mr. Peggotty	234	‘ Gummidge , Mr. Peggotty ? ’

17107	17172	17104	17104	I	0	’ I said to Em’ly . I do n’t know that I supposed anything of the kind , but I felt it an act of gallantry to say something ; and a shining sail close to us made such a pretty little image of itself , at the moment , in her bright eye , that it came into my head to say this . ‘
17175	17183	17184	17184	I	0	’ replied Em’ly , shaking her head , ‘
17185	17191	17184	17184	I	0	’m afraid of the sea . ’
17192	17195	17196	17196	I	0	‘ Afraid ! ’
17215	17219	17184	17184	I	0	‘ I an’t ! ’
17220	17228	17230	17230	Em’ly	262	‘ Ah ! but it ’s cruel , ’
17232	17262	17230	17230	Em’ly	262	‘ I have seen it very cruel to some of our men . I have seen it tear a boat as big as our house , all to pieces . ’
17263	17272	17184	17184	I	0	‘ I hope it was n’t the boat that-- ’
17273	17280	17282	17282	Em’ly	262	‘ That father was drownded in ? ’
17284	17297	17282	17282	Em’ly	262	‘ No . Not that one , I never see that boat . ’
17298	17302	17303	17303	I	0	‘ Nor him ? ’
17313	17318	17310	17310	her	262	‘ Not to remember ! ’
17453	17456	17461	17461	she	262	‘ Besides , ’
17469	17505	17461	17461	she	262	‘ your father was a gentleman and your mother is a lady ; and my father was a fisherman and my mother was a fisherman ’s daughter , and my uncle Dan is a fisherman . ’
17506	17515	17517	17517	I.	1041	‘ Dan is Mr. Peggotty , is he ? ’
17518	17524	17526	17526	Em’ly	262	‘ Uncle Dan -- yonder , ’
17535	17552	17526	17526	Em’ly	262	‘ Yes . I mean him . He must be very good , I should think ? ’
17553	17556	17558	17558	Em’ly	262	‘ Good ? ’
17560	17610	17611	17611	I	0	‘ If I was ever to be a lady , I ’d give him a sky - blue coat with diamond buttons , nankeen trousers , a red velvet waistcoat , a cocked hat , a large gold watch , a silver pipe , and a box of money . ’
17710	17719	17720	17720	I	0	‘ You would like to be a lady ? ’
17732	17734	17723	17723	Emily	268	‘ yes ’
17736	17800	17723	17723	Emily	268	‘ I should like it very much . We would all be gentlefolks together , then . Me , and uncle , and Ham , and Mrs. Gummidge . We would n’t mind then , when there comes stormy weather.---Not for our own sakes , I mean . We would for the poor fishermen ’s , to be sure , and we ’d help ‘
17811	17849	17723	17723	Emily	268	’ This seemed to me to be a very satisfactory and therefore not at all improbable picture . I expressed my pleasure in the contemplation of it , and little Em’ly was emboldened to say , shyly , ‘
17863	17910	17723	17723	Emily	268	’ It was quiet enough to reassure me , but I have no doubt if I had seen a moderately large wave come tumbling in , I should have taken to my heels , with an awful recollection of her drowned relations . However , I said ‘
17913	17918	17723	17723	Emily	268	’ and I added , ‘
17963	17965	17955	17955	I	0	‘ I ’m

18034	18507	18509	18511	two young mavishes	1050	’ She started from my side , and ran along a jagged timber which protruded from the place we stood upon , and overhung the deep water at some height , without the least defence . The incident is so impressed on my remembrance , that if I were a draughtsman I could draw its form here , I dare say , accurately as it was that day , and little Em’ly springing forward to her destruction ( as it appeared to me ) , with a look that I have never forgotten , directed far out to sea . The light , bold , fluttering little figure turned and came back safe to me , and I soon laughed at my fears , and at the cry I had uttered ; fruitlessly in any case , for there was no one near . But there have been times since , in my manhood , many times there have been , when I have thought , Is it possible , among the possibilities of hidden things , that in the sudden rashness of the child and her wild look so far off , there was any merciful attraction of her into danger , any tempting her towards him permitted on the part of her dead father , that her life might have a chance of ending that day ? There has been a time since when I have wondered whether , if the life before her could have been revealed to me at a glance , and so revealed as that a child could fully comprehend it , and if her preservation could have depended on a motion of my hand , I ought to have held it up to save her . There has been a time since -- I do not say it lasted long , but it has been -- when I have asked myself the question , would it have been better for little Em’ly to have had the waters close above her head that morning in my sight ; and when I have answered Yes , it would have been . This may be premature . I have set it down too soon , perhaps . But let it stand . We strolled a long way , and loaded ourselves with things that we thought curious , and put some stranded starfish carefully back into the water -- I hardly know enough of the race at this moment to be quite certain whether they had reason to feel obliged to us for doing so , or the reverse -- and then made our way home to Mr. Peggotty ’s dwelling . We stopped under the lee of the lobster - outhouse to exchange an innocent kiss , and went in to breakfast glowing with health and pleasure . ‘
18513	18831	18509	18511	two young mavishes	1050	’ Mr. Peggotty said . I knew this meant , in our local dialect , like two young thrushes , and received it as a compliment . Of course I was in love with little Em’ly . I am sure I loved that baby quite as truly , quite as tenderly , with greater purity and more disinterestedness , than can enter into the best love of a later time of life , high and ennobling as it is . I am sure my fancy raised up something round that blue - eyed mite of a child , which etherealized , and made a very angel of her . If , any sunny forenoon , she had spread a little pair of wings and flown away before my eyes , I do n’t think I should have regarded it as much more than I had had reason to expect . We used to walk about that dim old flat at Yarmouth in a loving manner , hours and hours . The days sported by us , as if Time had not grown up himself yet , but were a child too , and always at play . I told Em’ly I adored her , and that unless she confessed she adored me I should be reduced to the necessity of killing myself with a sword . She said she did , and I have no doubt she did . As to any sense of inequality , or youthfulness , or other difficulty in our way , little Em’ly and I had no such trouble , because we had no future . We made no more provision for growing older , than we did for growing younger . We were the admiration of Mrs. Gummidge and Peggotty , who used to whisper of an evening when we sat , lovingly , on our little locker side by side , ‘
18839	19096	19097	19097	I	0	’ Mr. Peggotty smiled at us from behind his pipe , and Ham grinned all the evening and did nothing else . They had something of the sort of pleasure in us , I suppose , that they might have had in a pretty toy , or a pocket model of the Colosseum . I soon found out that Mrs. Gummidge did not always make herself so agreeable as she might have been expected to do , under the circumstances of her residence with Mr. Peggotty . Mrs. Gummidge ’s was rather a fretful disposition , and she whimpered more sometimes than was comfortable for other parties in so small an establishment . I was very sorry for her ; but there were moments when it would have been more agreeable , I thought , if Mrs. Gummidge had had a convenient apartment of her own to retire to , and had stopped there until her spirits revived . Mr. Peggotty went occasionally to a public - house called The Willing Mind . I discovered this , by his being out on the second or third evening of our visit , and by Mrs. Gummidge ’s looking up at the Dutch clock , between eight and nine , and saying he was there , and that , what was more , she had known in the morning he would go there . Mrs. Gummidge had been in a low state all day , and had burst into tears in the forenoon , when the fire smoked . ‘
19103	19105	19107	19108	Mrs. Gummidge	267	’ , ’
19119	19127	19107	19108	Mrs. Gummidge	267	‘ and everythink goes contrary with me . ’
19128	19137	19139	19139	Peggotty	234	‘ Oh , it ’ll soon leave off , ’
19162	19163	19164	19164	I	0	’ ‘
19169	19247	19248	19250	the creeps ’	8895	’ said Mrs. Gummidge . It was a very cold day , with cutting blasts of wind . Mrs. Gummidge ’s peculiar corner of the fireside seemed to me to be the warmest and snuggest in the place , as her chair was certainly the easiest , but it did n’t suit her that day at all . She was constantly complaining of the cold , and of its occasioning a visitation in her back which she called ‘
19250	19267	19290	19290	Peggotty	234	’ . At last she shed tears on that subject , and said again that she was ‘
19272	19279	19248	19250	the creeps ’	8895	’ and everythink went contrary with her ’
19281	19288	19290	19290	Peggotty	234	‘ It is certainly very cold , ’
19292	19299	19290	19290	Peggotty	234	‘ Everybody must feel it so . ’
19300	19309	19311	19312	Mrs. Gummidge	267	‘ I feel it more than other people , ’
19477	19482	19484	19485	Mr. Peggotty	234	‘ Well , Mates , ’
19491	19497	19484	19485	Mr. Peggotty	234	‘ and how are you ? ’
19524	19529	19531	19532	Mr. Peggotty	234	‘ What ’s amiss ? ’
19541	19548	19538	19538	his	234	‘ Cheer up , old Mawther ! ’
19610	19617	19619	19620	Mr. Peggotty	234	‘ What ’s amiss , dame ? ’
19622	19625	19619	19620	Mr. Peggotty	234	‘ Nothing , ’
19630	19641	19627	19628	Mrs. Gummidge	267	‘ You ’ve come from The Willing Mind , Dan’l ? ’
19642	19658	19660	19661	Mr. Peggotty	234	‘ Why yes , I ’ve took a short spell at The Willing Mind tonight , ’

19747	19750	19786	19787	Mrs. Gummidge	267	‘ Along o ’

19789	19805	19786	19787	Mrs. Gummidge	267	‘ I know what I am . I know that I am a lone lorn creetur ’
19847	19849	19850	19850	I	0	’ . ’
19900	19911	19913	19914	Mrs. Gummidge	267	‘ I an’t what I could wish myself to be , ’
19916	19953	19913	19914	Mrs. Gummidge	267	‘ I am far from it . I know what I am . My troubles has made me contrary . I feel my troubles , and they make me contrary . I wish I did n’t feel ‘

20011	20021	20002	20002	I	0	‘ No , you have n’t , Mrs. Gummidge , ’
20027	20039	20041	20042	Mrs. Gummidge	267	‘ It ’s far from right that I should do it , ’
20044	20067	20041	20042	Mrs. Gummidge	267	‘ It an’t a fit return . I had better go into the house and die . I am a lone lorn creetur ’
20119	20181	20182	20182	She	1065	’ Mrs. Gummidge retired with these words , and betook herself to bed . When she was gone , Mr. Peggotty , who had not exhibited a trace of any feeling but the profoundest sympathy , looked round upon us , and nodding his head with a lively expression of that sentiment still animating his face , said in a whisper : ‘
20189	20192	20187	20190	the old ‘ un	8908	‘ un ! ’
20275	20286	20269	20269	him	8813	‘ Poor thing ! She ’s been thinking of the old ‘
20289	20865	20269	20269	him	8813	’ And whenever Mrs. Gummidge was overcome in a similar manner during the remainder of our stay ( which happened some few times ) , he always said the same thing in extenuation of the circumstance , and always with the tenderest commiseration . So the fortnight slipped away , varied by nothing but the variation of the tide , which altered Mr. Peggotty ’s times of going out and coming in , and altered Ham ’s engagements also . When the latter was unemployed , he sometimes walked with us to show us the boats and ships , and once or twice he took us for a row . I do n’t know why one slight set of impressions should be more particularly associated with a place than another , though I believe this obtains with most people , in reference especially to the associations of their childhood . I never hear the name , or read the name , of Yarmouth , but I am reminded of a certain Sunday morning on the beach , the bells ringing for church , little Em’ly leaning on my shoulder , Ham lazily dropping stones into the water , and the sun , away at sea , just breaking through the heavy mist , and showing us the ships , like their own shadows . At last the day came for going home . I bore up against the separation from Mr. Peggotty and Mrs. Gummidge , but my agony of mind at leaving little Em’ly was piercing . We went arm - in - arm to the public - house where the carrier put up , and I promised , on the road , to write to her . ( I redeemed that promise afterwards , in characters larger than those in which apartments are usually announced in manuscript , as being to let . ) We were greatly overcome at parting ; and if ever , in my life , I have had a void made in my heart , I had one made that day . Now , all the time I had been on my visit , I had been ungrateful to my home again , and had thought little or nothing about it . But I was no sooner turned towards it , than my reproachful young conscience seemed to point that way with a ready finger ; and I felt , all the more for the sinking of my spirits , that it was my nest , and that my mother was my comforter and friend . This gained upon me as we went along ; so that the nearer we drew , the more familiar the objects became that we passed , the more excited I was to get there , and to run into her arms . But Peggotty , instead of sharing in those transports , tried to check them ( though very kindly ) , and looked confused and out of sorts . Blunderstone Rookery would come , however , in spite of her , when the carrier ’s horse pleased -- and did . How well I recollect it , on a cold grey afternoon , with a dull sky , threatening rain ! The door opened , and I looked , half laughing and half crying in my pleasant agitation , for my mother . It was not she , but a strange servant . ‘
20870	20876	20910	20910	I’ll	1070	’ I said , ruefully , ‘
20883	20884	20889	20890	Master Davy	232	’ ‘
20892	20896	20889	20890	Master Davy	232	’ said Peggotty . ‘
20917	20982	20912	20912	I’ll	1070	’ Between her agitation , and her natural awkwardness in getting out of the cart , Peggotty was making a most extraordinary festoon of herself , but I felt too blank and strange to tell her so . When she had got down , she took me by the hand ; led me , wondering , into the kitchen ; and shut the door . ‘
20985	20992	20983	20983	Peggotty	234	’ said I , quite frightened . ‘
20998	20999	20983	20983	Peggotty	234	’ ‘
21012	21022	21008	21010	Master Davy dear	1071	’ she answered , assuming an air of sprightliness . ‘
21029	21036	21028	21028	I	0	’m sure . Where ’s mama ? ’
21037	21045	21047	21047	Peggotty	234	‘ Where ’s mama , Master Davy ? ’
21049	21075	21047	21047	Peggotty	234	‘ Yes . Why has n’t she come out to the gate , and what have we come in here for ? Oh , Peggotty ! ’
21093	21099	21101	21101	Peggotty	234	‘ Bless the precious boy ! ’
21108	21118	21101	21101	Peggotty	234	‘ What is it ? Speak , my pet ! ’
21119	21134	21135	21135	Peggotty	234	‘ Not dead , too ! Oh , she ’s not dead , Peggotty ? ’
21201	21215	21217	21217	Peggotty	234	‘ You see , dear , I should have told you before now , ’
21219	21259	21217	21217	Peggotty	234	‘ but I had n’t an opportunity . I ought to have made it , perhaps , but I could n’t azackly’--that was always the substitute for exactly , in Peggotty ’s militia of words--‘bring my mind to it . ’
21260	21266	21268	21268	I	0	‘ Go on , Peggotty , ’
21275	21279	21281	21281	Peggotty	234	‘ Master Davy , ’
21300	21312	21313	21313	I	0	‘ What do you think ? You have got a Pa ! ’
21355	21360	21362	21362	Peggotty	234	‘ A new one , ’
21364	21369	21370	21370	I	0	‘ A new one ? ’
21398	21404	21380	21380	she	1072	‘ Come and see him . ’
21405	21414	21380	21380	she	1072	‘ I do n’t want to see him . ’
21419	21476	21380	21380	she	1072	’ said Peggotty . I ceased to draw back , and we went straight to the best parlour , where she left me . On one side of the fire , sat my mother ; on the other , Mr. Murdstone . My mother dropped her work , and arose hurriedly , but timidly I thought . ‘
21483	21488	21479	21479	Clara	274	’ said Mr. Murdstone . ‘
21506	21995	21503	21503	you	1076	’ I gave him my hand . After a moment of suspense , I went and kissed my mother : she kissed me , patted me gently on the shoulder , and sat down again to her work . I could not look at her , I could not look at him , I knew quite well that he was looking at us both ; and I turned to the window and looked out there , at some shrubs that were drooping their heads in the cold . As soon as I could creep away , I crept upstairs . My old dear bedroom was changed , and I was to lie a long way off . I rambled downstairs to find anything that was like itself , so altered it all seemed ; and roamed into the yard . I very soon started back from there , for the empty dog - kennel was filled up with a great dog -- deep mouthed and black - haired like Him -- and he was very angry at the sight of me , and sprang out to get at me . CHAPTER 4 . I FALL INTO DISGRACE If the room to which my bed was removed were a sentient thing that could give evidence , I might appeal to it at this day -- who sleeps there now , I wonder!--to bear witness for me what a heavy heart I carried to it . I went up there , hearing the dog in the yard bark after me all the way while I climbed the stairs ; and , looking as blank and strange upon the room as the room looked upon me , sat down with my small hands crossed , and thought . I thought of the oddest things . Of the shape of the room , of the cracks in the ceiling , of the paper on the walls , of the flaws in the window - glass making ripples and dimples on the prospect , of the washing - stand being rickety on its three legs , and having a discontented something about it , which reminded me of Mrs. Gummidge under the influence of the old one . I was crying all the time , but , except that I was conscious of being cold and dejected , I am sure I never thought why I cried . At last in my desolation I began to consider that I was dreadfully in love with little Em’ly , and had been torn away from her to come here where no one seemed to want me , or to care about me , half as much as she did . This made such a very miserable piece of business of it , that I rolled myself up in a corner of the counterpane , and cried myself to sleep . I was awoke by somebody saying ‘
22000	22029	22030	22030	Davy	232	’ and uncovering my hot head . My mother and Peggotty had come to look for me , and it was one of them who had done it . ‘
22032	22037	22030	22030	Davy	232	’ said my mother . ‘
22043	22059	21503	21503	you	1076	’ I thought it was very strange that she should ask me , and answered , ‘
22062	22086	22087	22087	Davy	232	’ I turned over on my face , I recollect , to hide my trembling lip , which answered her with greater truth . ‘
22089	22094	22087	22087	Davy	232	’ said my mother . ‘
22100	22151	22095	22095	Davy	232	’ I dare say no words she could have uttered would have affected me so much , then , as her calling me her child . I hid my tears in the bedclothes , and pressed her from me with my hand , when she would have raised me up . ‘
22163	22168	22169	22169	I	0	’ said my mother . ‘
22216	22244	22209	22209	you	232	’ Poor Peggotty lifted up her hands and eyes , and only answered , in a sort of paraphrase of the grace I usually repeated after dinner , ‘
22268	22269	22245	22245	Lord	1081	’ ‘
22277	22282	22245	22245	Lord	1081	’ cried my mother . ‘
22330	22350	22328	22328	me	0	’ cried my mother , turning from one of us to the other , in her pettish wilful manner , ‘
22374	22421	22328	22328	me	0	’ I felt the touch of a hand that I knew was neither hers nor Peggotty ’s , and slipped to my feet at the bed - side . It was Mr. Murdstone ’s hand , and he kept it on my arm as he said : ‘
22438	22439	22440	22440	I	0	’ ‘
22447	22452	22445	22445	Edward	276	’ said my mother . ‘
22466	22467	22461	22461	I	0	’ ‘
22470	22474	22461	22461	I	0	’ he answered . ‘
22486	22487	22488	22488	I	0	’ ‘
22501	22508	22488	22488	I	0	’ returned my mother , pouting ; ‘
22519	22588	22488	22488	I	0	’ He drew her to him , whispered in her ear , and kissed her . I knew as well , when I saw my mother ’s head lean down upon his shoulder , and her arm touch his neck -- I knew as well that he could mould her pliant nature into any form he chose , as I know , now , that he did it . ‘
22596	22601	22590	22590	you	1087	’ said Mr. Murdstone . ‘
22614	22640	22611	22611	My	0	’ turning a darkening face on Peggotty , when he had watched my mother out , and dismissed her with a nod and a smile ; ‘
22649	22650	22642	22642	you	0	’ ‘
22662	22666	22651	22651	She	8511	’ answered Peggotty , ‘
22673	22674	22651	22651	She	8511	’ ‘
22679	22683	22651	22651	She	8511	’ he answered . ‘
22719	22825	22715	22715	you	0	’ Peggotty , with some uneasy glances at me , curtseyed herself out of the room without replying ; seeing , I suppose , that she was expected to go , and had no excuse for remaining . When we two were left alone , he shut the door , and sitting on a chair , and holding me standing before him , looked steadily into my eyes . I felt my own attracted , no less steadily , to his . As I recall our being opposed thus , face to face , I seem again to hear my heart beat fast and high . ‘
22828	22842	22826	22826	David	229	’ he said , making his lips thin , by pressing them together , ‘
22862	22863	22857	22857	you	229	’ ‘
22869	22870	22871	22871	I	0	’ ‘
22875	22901	22902	22902	I	0	’ I had answered in a kind of breathless whisper , but I felt , in my silence , that my breath was shorter now . ‘
22948	22949	22950	22950	Dirt	277	’ ‘
22952	23000	23001	23001	You	0	’ I said . He knew it was the mark of tears as well as I. But if he had asked the question twenty times , each time with twenty blows , I believe my baby heart would have burst before I would have told him so . ‘
23013	23026	23028	23028	you	0	’ he said , with a grave smile that belonged to him , ‘
23049	23110	23111	23111	Clara	274	’ He pointed to the washing - stand , which I had made out to be like Mrs. Gummidge , and motioned me with his head to obey him directly . I had little doubt then , and I have less doubt now , that he would have knocked me down without the least compunction , if I had hesitated . ‘
23116	23143	23111	23111	Clara	274	’ he said , when I had done his bidding , and he walked me into the parlour , with his hand still on my arm ; ‘
23164	23822	23156	23156	We	1099	’ God help me , I might have been improved for my whole life , I might have been made another creature perhaps , for life , by a kind word at that season . A word of encouragement and explanation , of pity for my childish ignorance , of welcome home , of reassurance to me that it was home , might have made me dutiful to him in my heart henceforth , instead of in my hypocritical outside , and might have made me respect instead of hate him . I thought my mother was sorry to see me standing in the room so scared and strange , and that , presently , when I stole to a chair , she followed me with her eyes more sorrowfully still -- missing , perhaps , some freedom in my childish tread -- but the word was not spoken , and the time for it was gone . We dined alone , we three together . He seemed to be very fond of my mother -- I am afraid I liked him none the better for that -- and she was very fond of him . I gathered from what they said , that an elder sister of his was coming to stay with them , and that she was expected that evening . I am not certain whether I found out then , or afterwards , that , without being actively concerned in any business , he had some share in , or some annual charge upon the profits of , a wine - merchant ’s house in London , with which his family had been connected from his great - grandfather ’s time , and in which his sister had a similar interest ; but I may mention it in this place , whether or no . After dinner , when we were sitting by the fire , and I was meditating an escape to Peggotty without having the hardihood to slip away , lest it should offend the master of the house , a coach drove up to the garden - gate and he went out to receive the visitor . My mother followed him . I was timidly following her , when she turned round at the parlour door , in the dusk , and taking me in her embrace as she had been used to do , whispered me to love my new father and be obedient to him . She did this hurriedly and secretly , as if it were wrong , but tenderly ; and , putting out her hand behind her , held mine in it , until we came near to where he was standing in the garden , where she let mine go , and drew hers through his arm . It was Miss Murdstone who was arrived , and a gloomy - looking lady she was ; dark , like her brother , whom she greatly resembled in face and voice ; and with very heavy eyebrows , nearly meeting over her large nose , as if , being disabled by the wrongs of her sex from wearing whiskers , she had carried them to that account . She brought with her two uncompromising hard black boxes , with her initials on the lids in hard brass nails . When she paid the coachman she took her money out of a hard steel purse , and she kept the purse in a very jail of a bag which hung upon her arm by a heavy chain , and shut up like a bite . I had never , at that time , seen such a metallic lady altogether as Miss Murdstone was . She was brought into the parlour with many tokens of welcome , and there formally recognized my mother as a new and near relation . Then she looked at me , and said : ‘
23834	23840	23825	23826	your boy	1101	’ My mother acknowledged me . ‘
23844	23849	23825	23826	your boy	1101	’ said Miss Murdstone , ‘
23862	23901	23860	23860	boy	8517	’ Under these encouraging circumstances , I replied that I was very well , and that I hoped she was the same ; with such an indifferent grace , that Miss Murdstone disposed of me in two words : ‘
23905	24026	23860	23860	boy	8517	’ Having uttered which , with great distinctness , she begged the favour of being shown to her room , which became to me from that time forth a place of awe and dread , wherein the two black boxes were never seen open or known to be left unlocked , and where ( for I peeped in once or twice when she was out ) numerous little steel fetters and rivets , with which Miss Murdstone embellished herself when she was dressed , generally hung upon the looking - glass in formidable array . As well as I could make out , she had come for good , and had no intention of ever going again . She began to ‘
24028	24286	23860	23860	boy	8517	’ my mother next morning , and was in and out of the store - closet all day , putting things to rights , and making havoc in the old arrangements . Almost the first remarkable thing I observed in Miss Murdstone was , her being constantly haunted by a suspicion that the servants had a man secreted somewhere on the premises . Under the influence of this delusion , she dived into the coal - cellar at the most untimely hours , and scarcely ever opened the door of a dark cupboard without clapping it to again , in the belief that she had got him . Though there was nothing very airy about Miss Murdstone , she was a perfect Lark in point of getting up . She was up ( and , as I believe to this hour , looking for that man ) before anybody in the house was stirring . Peggotty gave it as her opinion that she even slept with one eye open ; but I could not concur in this idea ; for I tried it myself after hearing the suggestion thrown out , and found it could n’t be done . On the very first morning after her arrival she was up and ringing her bell at cock - crow . When my mother came down to breakfast and was going to make the tea , Miss Murdstone gave her a kind of peck on the cheek , which was her nearest approach to a kiss , and said : ‘
24313	24371	24312	24312	You	274	’re much too pretty and thoughtless’--my mother blushed but laughed , and seemed not to dislike this character--‘to have any duties imposed upon you that can be undertaken by me . If you ’ll be so good as give me your keys , my dear , I ’ll attend to all this sort of thing in future . ’
24466	24469	24471	24472	Mr. Murdstone	247	‘ Clara ! ’
24475	24483	24471	24472	Mr. Murdstone	247	‘ Clara ! I wonder at you . ’
24484	24498	24500	24501	my mother	740	‘ Oh , it ’s very well to say you wonder , Edward ! ’
24503	24524	24500	24501	my mother	740	‘ and it ’s very well for you to talk about firmness , but you would n’t like it yourself . ’
24712	24718	24720	24721	my mother	740	‘ It ’s very hard , ’
24723	24729	24720	24721	my mother	740	‘ that in my own house-- ’
24730	24735	24737	24738	Mr. Murdstone	247	‘ My own house ? ’
24740	24743	24737	24738	Mr. Murdstone	247	‘ Clara ! ’
24744	24752	24754	24755	my mother	740	‘ OUR own house , I mean , ’
24806	24813	24815	24815	Peggotty	234	’ said my mother , sobbing ; ‘
24830	24831	24832	24832	Edward	276	’ ‘
24834	24839	24832	24832	Edward	276	’ said Miss Murdstone , ‘
24852	24853	24848	24848	I	0	’ ‘
24857	24862	24848	24848	I	0	’ said her brother , ‘
24884	24885	24868	24868	you	279	’ ‘
24890	24907	24886	24886	I	0	’ my poor mother went on , at a grievous disadvantage , and with many tears , ‘
25014	25015	25009	25009	you	279	’ ‘
25018	25025	25016	25016	Edward	276	’ said Miss Murdstone , again , ‘
25038	25039	25040	25041	Jane Murdstone	279	’ ‘
25043	25048	25040	25041	Jane Murdstone	279	’ thundered Mr. Murdstone . ‘
25058	25079	25056	25056	you	279	’ Miss Murdstone made a jail - delivery of her pocket - handkerchief , and held it before her eyes . ‘
25082	25091	25092	25092	you	274	’ he continued , looking at my mother , ‘
25180	25181	25188	25188	Edward	276	’ ‘
25190	25195	25188	25188	Edward	276	’ cried my mother , ‘
25237	25238	25234	25235	my dear	854	’ ‘
25247	25260	25244	25244	I	0	’ he went on , after waiting until my mother was silent , ‘
25275	25276	25244	25244	I	0	’ ‘
25286	25293	25244	25244	I	0	’ implored my mother very piteously . ‘
25349	25352	25344	25344	she	1133	’m affectionate . ’
25353	25364	25366	25367	Mr. Murdstone	247	‘ There is no extent of mere weakness , Clara , ’
25371	25385	25366	25367	Mr. Murdstone	247	‘ that can have the least weight with me . You lose breath . ’
25386	25393	25395	25396	my mother	740	‘ Pray let us be friends , ’
25398	25468	25395	25396	my mother	740	‘ I could n’t live under coldness or unkindness . I am so sorry . I have a great many defects , I know , and it ’s very good of you , Edward , with your strength of mind , to endeavour to correct them for me . Jane , I do n’t object to anything . I should be quite broken - hearted if you thought of leaving-- ’
25479	25483	25485	25486	Mr. Murdstone	247	‘ Jane Murdstone , ’
25491	25553	25554	25554	he	247	‘ any harsh words between us are , I hope , uncommon . It is not my fault that so unusual an occurrence has taken place tonight . I was betrayed into it by another . Nor is it your fault . You were betrayed into it by another . Let us both try to forget it . And as this , ’
25562	25578	25554	25554	he	247	‘ is not a fit scene for the boy -- David , go to bed ! ’
26030	26033	26037	26037	she	278	‘ miserable sinners ’
26852	26859	26848	26848	she	740	‘ Oh , Davy , Davy ! ’
26860	26865	26867	26868	Mr. Murdstone	247	‘ Now , Clara , ’
26870	26905	26867	26868	Mr. Murdstone	247	‘ be firm with the boy . Do n’t say , “ Oh , Davy , Davy ! ” That ’s childish . He knows his lesson , or he does not know it . ’
26906	26913	26914	26915	Miss Murdstone	278	‘ He does NOT know it , ’
26919	26928	26930	26931	my mother	740	‘ I am really afraid he does not , ’
26933	26941	26930	26931	my mother	740	‘ Then , you see , Clara , ’
26946	26962	26943	26944	Miss Murdstone	278	‘ you should just give him the book back , and make him know it . ’
26963	26968	26970	26971	my mother	740	‘ Yes , certainly , ’
26973	27000	26970	26971	my mother	740	‘ that is what I intend to do , my dear Jane . Now , Davy , try once more , and do n’t be stupid . ’
27315	27318	27293	27294	Miss Murdstone	278	‘ Clara ! ’
27403	27608	27397	27398	Mr. Murdstone	247	‘ If I go into a cheesemonger ’s shop , and buy five thousand double - Gloucester cheeses at fourpence - halfpenny each , present payment’--at which I see Miss Murdstone secretly overjoyed . I pore over these cheeses without any result or enlightenment until dinner - time , when , having made a Mulatto of myself by getting the dirt of the slate into the pores of my skin , I have a slice of bread to help me out with the cheeses , and am considered in disgrace for the rest of the evening . It seems to me , at this distance of time , as if my unfortunate studies generally took this course . I could have done very well if I had been without the Murdstones ; but the influence of the Murdstones upon me was like the fascination of two snakes on a wretched young bird . Even when I did get through the morning with tolerable credit , there was not much gained but dinner ; for Miss Murdstone never could endure to see me untasked , and if I rashly made any show of being unemployed , called her brother ’s attention to me by saying , ‘
27625	28419	28420	28420	I	0	’ ; which caused me to be clapped down to some new labour , there and then . As to any recreation with other children of my age , I had very little of that ; for the gloomy theology of the Murdstones made all children out to be a swarm of little vipers ( though there WAS a child once set in the midst of the Disciples ) , and held that they contaminated one another . The natural result of this treatment , continued , I suppose , for some six months or more , was to make me sullen , dull , and dogged . I was not made the less so by my sense of being daily more and more shut out and alienated from my mother . I believe I should have been almost stupefied but for one circumstance . It was this . My father had left a small collection of books in a little room upstairs , to which I had access ( for it adjoined my own ) and which nobody else in our house ever troubled . From that blessed little room , Roderick Random , Peregrine Pickle , Humphrey Clinker , Tom Jones , the Vicar of Wakefield , Don Quixote , Gil Blas , and Robinson Crusoe , came out , a glorious host , to keep me company . They kept alive my fancy , and my hope of something beyond that place and time,--they , and the Arabian Nights , and the Tales of the Genii,--and did me no harm ; for whatever harm was in some of them was not there for me ; I knew nothing of it . It is astonishing to me now , how I found time , in the midst of my porings and blunderings over heavier themes , to read those books as I did . It is curious to me how I could ever have consoled myself under my small troubles ( which were great troubles to me ) , by impersonating my favourite characters in them -- as I did -- and by putting Mr. and Miss Murdstone into all the bad ones -- which I did too . I have been Tom Jones ( a child ’s Tom Jones , a harmless creature ) for a week together . I have sustained my own idea of Roderick Random for a month at a stretch , I verily believe . I had a greedy relish for a few volumes of Voyages and Travels -- I forget what , now -- that were on those shelves ; and for days and days I can remember to have gone about my region of our house , armed with the centre - piece out of an old set of boot - trees -- the perfect realization of Captain Somebody , of the Royal British Navy , in danger of being beset by savages , and resolved to sell his life at a great price . The Captain never lost dignity , from having his ears boxed with the Latin Grammar . I did ; but the Captain was a Captain and a hero , in despite of all the grammars of all the languages in the world , dead or alive . This was my only and my constant comfort . When I think of it , the picture always rises in my mind , of a summer evening , the boys at play in the churchyard , and I sitting on my bed , reading as if for life . Every barn in the neighbourhood , every stone in the church , and every foot of the churchyard , had some association of its own , in my mind , connected with these books , and stood for some locality made famous in them . I have seen Tom Pipes go climbing up the church - steeple ; I have watched Strap , with the knapsack on his back , stopping to rest himself upon the wicket - gate ; and I know that Commodore Trunnion held that club with Mr. Pickle , in the parlour of our little village alehouse . The reader now understands , as well as I do , what I was when I came to that point of my youthful history to which I am now coming again . One morning when I went into the parlour with my books , I found my mother looking anxious , Miss Murdstone looking firm , and Mr. Murdstone binding something round the bottom of a cane -- a lithe and limber cane , which he left off binding when I came in , and poised and switched in the air . ‘
28426	28431	28420	28420	I	0	’ said Mr. Murdstone , ‘

28448	28453	28458	28458	Jane	279	’ said Miss Murdstone . ‘
28460	28467	28458	28458	Jane	279	’ faltered my mother , meekly . ‘
28479	28480	28472	28472	you	1204	’ ‘
28491	28498	28482	28482	you	1204	’ asked Mr. Murdstone , gravely . ‘
28504	28515	28482	28482	you	1204	’ said his sister . To this my mother returned , ‘
28522	28552	28520	28520	Jane	279	’ and said no more . I felt apprehensive that I was personally interested in this dialogue , and sought Mr. Murdstone ’s eye as it lighted on mine . ‘
28557	28580	28581	28581	He	1206	’ he said -- and I saw that cast again as he said it--‘you must be far more careful today than usual . ’
28787	28790	28792	28793	Miss Murdstone	278	‘ Clara ! ’
28800	28814	28816	28817	my mother	740	‘ I am not quite well , my dear Jane , I think , ’
28841	28902	28831	28831	he	1206	‘ Why , Jane , we can hardly expect Clara to bear , with perfect firmness , the worry and torment that David has occasioned her today . That would be stoical . Clara is greatly strengthened and improved , but we can hardly expect so much from her . David , you and I will go upstairs , boy . ’
28922	28931	28918	28919	Miss Murdstone	278	‘ Clara ! are you a perfect fool ? ’
28990	28996	28997	28997	I	0	‘ Mr. Murdstone ! Sir ! ’
29002	29038	28997	28997	I	0	‘ Do n’t ! Pray do n’t beat me ! I have tried to learn , sir , but I ca n’t learn while you and Miss Murdstone are by . I ca n’t indeed ! ’
29039	29048	29049	29049	he	1206	‘ Ca n’t you , indeed , David ? ’
29052	29058	29049	29049	he	1206	‘ We ’ll try that . ’
30116	30123	30099	30099	I	0	‘ Is that you , Peggotty ? ’
30193	30201	30174	30174	I	0	‘ Is that you , Peggotty dear ? ’
30202	30210	30211	30211	she	1241	‘ Yes , my own precious Davy , ’
30214	30228	30211	30211	she	1241	‘ Be as soft as a mouse , or the Cat’ll hear us . ’

30293	30299	30290	30290	she	1241	‘ No . Not very . ’
30300	30317	30341	30341	she	1241	‘ What is going to be done with me , Peggotty dear ? Do you know ? ’
30318	30324	30326	30326	Peggotty	234	‘ School . Near London , ’
30388	30393	30374	30374	her	1241	‘ When , Peggotty ? ’
30394	30397	30374	30374	her	1241	‘ Tomorrow . ’
30398	30414	30416	30416	she	1241	‘ Is that the reason why Miss Murdstone took the clothes out of my drawers ? ’
30428	30431	30433	30433	Peggotty	234	‘ Yes , ’
30435	30438	30433	30433	Peggotty	234	‘ Box . ’

30447	30450	30452	30452	Peggotty	234	‘ Yes , ’
30454	30457	30452	30452	Peggotty	234	‘ Morning . ’
30512	30585	30491	30491	I	0	‘ Davy , dear . If I ai n’t been azackly as intimate with you . Lately , as I used to be . It ai n’t because I do n’t love you . Just as well and more , my pretty poppet . It ’s because I thought it better for you . And for someone else besides . Davy , my darling , are you listening ? Can you hear ? ’
30586	30597	30598	30598	I	0	‘ Ye - ye - ye - yes , Peggotty ! ’
30601	30605	30607	30607	Peggotty	234	‘ My own ! ’
30613	30710	30719	30719	she	1243	‘ What I want to say , is . That you must never forget me . For I ’ll never forget you . And I ’ll take as much care of your mama , Davy . As ever I took of you . And I wo n’t leave her . The day may come when she ’ll be glad to lay her poor head . On her stupid , cross old Peggotty ’s arm again . And I ’ll write to you , my dear . Though I ai n’t no scholar . And I’ll -- I’ll-- ’
30725	30732	30719	30719	she	1243	‘ Thank you , dear Peggotty ! ’
30735	30785	30786	30786	em	1244	‘ Oh , thank you ! Thank you ! Will you promise me one thing , Peggotty ? Will you write and tell Mr. Peggotty and little Em’ly , and Mrs. Gummidge and Ham , that I am not so bad as they might suppose , and that I sent ‘
30805	31037	30800	30800	you	0	’ The kind soul promised , and we both of us kissed the keyhole with the greatest affection -- I patted it with my hand , I recollect , as if it had been her honest face -- and parted . From that night there grew up in my breast a feeling for Peggotty which I can not very well define . She did not replace my mother ; no one could do that ; but she came into a vacancy in my heart , which closed upon her , and I felt towards her something I have never felt for any other human being . It was a sort of comical affection , too ; and yet if she had died , I can not think what I should have done , or how I should have acted out the tragedy it would have been to me . In the morning Miss Murdstone appeared as usual , and told me I was going to school ; which was not altogether such news to me as she supposed . She also informed me that when I was dressed , I was to come downstairs into the parlour , and have my breakfast . There , I found my mother , very pale and with red eyes : into whose arms I ran , and begged her pardon from my suffering soul . ‘
31042	31046	30800	30800	you	0	’ she said . ‘
31088	31171	31172	31173	Master Copperfield	232	’ They had persuaded her that I was a wicked fellow , and she was more sorry for that than for my going away . I felt it sorely . I tried to eat my parting breakfast , but my tears dropped upon my bread - and - butter , and trickled into my tea . I saw my mother look at me sometimes , and then glance at the watchful Miss Murdstone , and than look down , or look away . ‘
31178	31234	31235	31235	Clara	274	’ said Miss Murdstone , when wheels were heard at the gate . I looked for Peggotty , but it was not she ; neither she nor Mr. Murdstone appeared . My former acquaintance , the carrier , was at the door . The box was taken out to his cart , and lifted in . ‘
31237	31247	31235	31235	Clara	274	’ said Miss Murdstone , in her warning note . ‘
31254	31259	31252	31252	Jane	279	’ returned my mother . ‘
31295	31296	31297	31297	Clara	274	’ ‘
31299	31304	31297	31297	Clara	274	’ Miss Murdstone repeated . ‘
31311	31321	31309	31309	Jane	279	’ replied my mother , who was holding me . ‘
31334	31335	31336	31336	Clara	274	’ ‘
31338	31639	31336	31336	Clara	274	’ Miss Murdstone repeated . Miss Murdstone was good enough to take me out to the cart , and to say on the way that she hoped I would repent , before I came to a bad end ; and then I got into the cart , and the lazy horse walked off with it . CHAPTER 5 . I AM SENT AWAY FROM HOME We might have gone about half a mile , and my pocket - handkerchief was quite wet through , when the carrier stopped short . Looking out to ascertain for what , I saw , to My amazement , Peggotty burst from a hedge and climb into the cart . She took me in both her arms , and squeezed me to her stays until the pressure on my nose was extremely painful , though I never thought of that till afterwards when I found it very tender . Not a single word did Peggotty speak . Releasing one of her arms , she put it down in her pocket to the elbow , and brought out some paper bags of cakes which she crammed into my pockets , and a purse which she put into my hand , but not one word did she say . After another and a final squeeze with both arms , she got down from the cart and ran away ; and , my belief is , and has always been , without a solitary button on her gown . I picked up one , of several that were rolling about , and treasured it as a keepsake for a long time . The carrier looked at me , as if to inquire if she were coming back . I shook my head , and said I thought not . ‘
31644	31825	31336	31336	Clara	274	’ said the carrier to the lazy horse ; who came up accordingly . Having by this time cried as much as I possibly could , I began to think it was of no use crying any more , especially as neither Roderick Random , nor that Captain in the Royal British Navy , had ever cried , that I could remember , in trying situations . The carrier , seeing me in this resolution , proposed that my pocket - handkerchief should be spread upon the horse ’s back to dry . I thanked him , and assented ; and particularly small it looked , under those circumstances . I had now leisure to examine the purse . It was a stiff leather purse , with a snap , and had three bright shillings in it , which Peggotty had evidently polished up with whitening , for my greater delight . But its most precious contents were two half - crowns folded together in a bit of paper , on which was written , in my mother ’s hand , ‘
31833	31937	31827	31827	Davy	232	’ I was so overcome by this , that I asked the carrier to be so good as to reach me my pocket - handkerchief again ; but he said he thought I had better do without it , and I thought I really had , so I wiped my eyes on my sleeve and stopped myself . For good , too ; though , in consequence of my previous emotions , I was still occasionally seized with a stormy sob . After we had jogged on for some little time , I asked the carrier if he was going all the way . ‘
31943	31948	32008	32008	you	1253	’ inquired the carrier . ‘
31951	31955	32008	32008	you	1253	’ I said . ‘
31960	31965	32008	32008	you	1253	’ inquired the carrier . ‘
31969	31973	32008	32008	you	1253	’ I said . ‘
31978	31991	32008	32008	you	1253	’ said the carrier , jerking the rein to point him out , ‘
32005	32006	32008	32008	you	1253	’ ‘
32015	32019	32008	32008	you	1253	’ I asked . ‘
32025	32030	32008	32008	you	1253	’ said the carrier . ‘
32058	32143	32145	32145	SHE	1256	’ As this was a great deal for the carrier ( whose name was Mr. Barkis ) to say -- he being , as I observed in a former chapter , of a phlegmatic temperament , and not at all conversational -- I offered him a cake as a mark of attention , which he ate at one gulp , exactly like an elephant , and which made no more impression on his big face than it would have done on an elephant ’s . ‘
32147	32152	32154	32155	Mr. Barkis	294	‘ em , now ? ’
32179	32188	32162	32162	his	0	‘ Peggotty , do you mean , sir ? ’
32189	32192	32194	32195	Mr. Barkis	294	‘ Ah ! ’
32197	32200	32194	32195	Mr. Barkis	294	‘ Her . ’
32201	32216	32162	32162	his	0	‘ Yes . She makes all our pastry , and does all our cooking . ’
32217	32222	32224	32225	Mr. Barkis	294	‘ Do she though ? ’
32276	32283	32273	32273	he	0	‘ No sweethearts , I b’lieve ? ’
32284	32293	32273	32273	he	0	‘ Sweetmeats did you say , Mr. Barkis ? ’
32314	32317	32319	32320	Mr. Barkis	294	‘ Hearts , ’
32322	32332	32319	32320	Mr. Barkis	294	‘ Sweet hearts ; no person walks with her ! ’
32333	32337	32273	32273	he	0	‘ With Peggotty ? ’
32338	32341	32342	32342	he	0	‘ Ah ! ’
32345	32348	32342	32342	he	0	‘ Her . ’
32349	32360	32273	32273	he	0	‘ Oh , no . She never had a sweetheart . ’
32361	32368	32370	32371	Mr. Barkis	294	‘ Did n’t she , though ! ’
32398	32403	32405	32406	Mr. Barkis	294	‘ So she makes , ’
32415	32430	32405	32406	Mr. Barkis	294	‘ all the apple parsties , and doos all the cooking , do she ? ’
32439	32448	32450	32451	Mr. Barkis	294	‘ Well . I ’ll tell you what , ’

32559	32572	32573	32573	I	0	‘ But you will be at Blunderstone again tomorrow , Mr. Barkis , ’
32601	32631	32573	32573	I	0	’ As he repudiated this suggestion , however , with a jerk of his head , and once more confirmed his previous request by saying , with profound gravity , ‘
32635	32642	32643	32643	I	0	’ . That ’s the message , ’
32686	32723	32680	32680	Peggotty	234	‘ My dear Peggotty . I have come here safe . Barkis is willing . My love to mama . Yours affectionately . P.S. He says he particularly wants you to know -- BARKIS IS WILLING . ’

33037	33057	33058	33058	William	297	’ I explained to the lady how it was , who than rang a bell , and called out , ‘
33066	33259	33058	33058	William	297	’ upon which a waiter came running out of a kitchen on the opposite side of the yard to show it , and seemed a good deal surprised when he was only to show it to me . It was a large long room with some large maps in it . I doubt if I could have felt much stranger if the maps had been real foreign countries , and I cast away in the middle of them . I felt it was taking a liberty to sit down , with my cap in my hand , on the corner of the chair nearest the door ; and when the waiter laid a cloth on purpose for me , and put a set of castors on it , I think I must have turned red all over with modesty . He brought me some chops , and vegetables , and took the covers off in such a bouncing manner that I was afraid I must have given him some offence . But he greatly relieved my mind by putting a chair for me at the table , and saying , very affably , ‘
33269	33344	33010	33010	I	0	’ I thanked him , and took my seat at the board ; but found it extremely difficult to handle my knife and fork with anything like dexterity , or to avoid splashing myself with the gravy , while he was standing opposite , staring so hard , and making me blush in the most dreadful manner every time I caught his eye . After watching me into the second chop , he said : ‘
33361	33368	33356	33356	you	1275	’ I thanked him and said , ‘
33371	33400	33356	33356	you	1275	’ Upon which he poured it out of a jug into a large tumbler , and held it up against the light , and made it look beautiful . ‘
33404	33408	33356	33356	you	1275	’ he said . ‘
33419	33420	33356	33356	you	1275	’ ‘
33428	33499	33356	33356	you	1275	’ I answered with a smile . For it was quite delightful to me , to find him so pleasant . He was a twinkling - eyed , pimple - faced man , with his hair standing upright all over his head ; and as he stood with one arm a - kimbo , holding up the glass to the light with the other hand , he looked quite friendly . ‘
33508	33525	33502	33503	a gentleman	8847	’ he said--‘a stout gentleman , by the name of Topsawyer -- perhaps you know him ? ’

33533	33538	33530	33530	I	0	‘ I do n’t think-- ’
33539	33556	33558	33559	the waiter	9176	‘ In breeches and gaiters , broad - brimmed hat , grey coat , speckled choker , ’

33576	33582	33584	33593	the waiter , looking at the light through the tumbler	1279	‘ He came in here , ’
33595	33638	33584	33593	the waiter , looking at the light through the tumbler	1279	‘ ordered a glass of this ale -- WOULD order it -- I told him not -- drank it , and fell dead . It was too old for him . It ought n’t to be drawn ; that ’s the fact . ’
33662	33667	33669	33670	the waiter	9176	‘ Why you see , ’
33689	33703	33684	33684	his	9176	‘ our people do n’t like things being ordered and left . It offends ‘
33717	33752	33716	33716	I	0	’m used to it , and use is everything . I do n’t think it ’ll hurt me , if I throw my head back , and take it off quick . Shall I ? ’
33842	33849	33850	33850	he	9176	‘ What have we got here ? ’
33860	33864	33850	33850	he	9176	‘ Not chops ? ’

33882	33914	33879	33879	he	9176	‘ I did n’t know they were chops . Why , a chop ’s the very thing to take off the bad effects of that beer ! Ai n’t it lucky ? ’
34001	34007	34008	34008	he	9176	‘ How ’s the pie ? ’
34014	34020	34008	34008	he	9176	‘ It ’s a pudding , ’
34025	34028	34029	34029	he	9176	‘ Pudding ! ’
34032	34044	34029	34029	he	9176	‘ Why , bless me , so it is ! What ! ’
34050	34064	34029	34029	he	9176	‘ You do n’t mean to say it ’s a batter - pudding ! ’
34065	34072	34029	34029	he	9176	‘ Yes , it is indeed . ’
34073	34081	34082	34082	he	9176	‘ Why , a batter - pudding , ’
34092	34107	34082	34082	he	9176	‘ is my favourite pudding ! Ai n’t that lucky ? Come on , little ‘
34119	34280	34082	34082	he	9176	’ The waiter certainly got most . He entreated me more than once to come in and win , but what with his table - spoon to my tea - spoon , his dispatch to my dispatch , and his appetite to my appetite , I was left far behind at the first mouthful , and had no chance with him . I never saw anyone enjoy a pudding so much , I think ; and he laughed , when it was all gone , as if his enjoyment of it lasted still . Finding him so very friendly and companionable , it was then that I asked for the pen and ink and paper , to write to Peggotty . He not only brought it immediately , but was good enough to look over me while I wrote the letter . When I had finished it , he asked me where I was going to school . I said , ‘
34284	34291	34082	34082	he	9176	’ which was all I knew . ‘
34297	34307	34294	34294	my	0	’ he said , looking very low - spirited , ‘
34314	34315	34308	34308	I	0	’ ‘
34318	34323	34308	34308	I	0	’ I asked him . ‘
34328	34336	34326	34326	Lord	1283	’ he said , shaking his head , ‘
34375	34384	34371	34371	you	0	’ I told him between eight and nine . ‘
34391	34395	34388	34388	his	9042	’ he said . ‘
34428	34472	34418	34418	they	1285	’ I could not disguise from myself , or from the waiter , that this was an uncomfortable coincidence , and inquired how it was done . His answer was not cheering to my spirits , for it consisted of two dismal words , ‘
34476	34528	34418	34418	they	1285	’ The blowing of the coach - horn in the yard was a seasonable diversion , which made me get up and hesitatingly inquire , in the mingled pride and diffidence of having a purse ( which I took out of my pocket ) , if there were anything to pay . ‘
34538	34542	34418	34418	they	1285	’ he returned . ‘
34554	34564	34544	34544	you	1288	’ I could not remember that I ever had . ‘
34569	34573	34544	34544	you	1288	’ he said , ‘
34587	34612	34418	34418	they	1285	’re taxed in this country . There ’s nothing else , except the waiter . Never mind the ink . I lose by that . ’
34613	34642	34643	34643	I	0	‘ What should you -- what should I -- how much ought I to -- what would it be right to pay the waiter , if you please ? ’
34648	34664	34666	34667	the waiter	9176	‘ If I had n’t a family , and that family had n’t the cowpock , ’
34669	34862	34666	34667	the waiter	9176	‘ I would n’t take a sixpence . If I did n’t support a aged pairint , and a lovely sister,’--here the waiter was greatly agitated--‘I would n’t take a farthing . If I had a good place , and was treated well here , I should beg acceptance of a trifle , instead of taking of it . But I live on broken wittles -- and I sleep on the coals’--here the waiter burst into tears . I was very much concerned for his misfortunes , and felt that any recognition short of ninepence would be mere brutality and hardness of heart . Therefore I gave him one of my three bright shillings , which he received with much humility and veneration , and spun up with his thumb , directly afterwards , to try the goodness of . It was a little disconcerting to me , to find , when I was being helped up behind the coach , that I was supposed to have eaten all the dinner without any assistance . I discovered this , from overhearing the lady in the bow - window say to the guard , ‘
34876	35570	34872	34872	he	1291	’ and from observing that the women - servants who were about the place came out to look and giggle at me as a young phenomenon . My unfortunate friend the waiter , who had quite recovered his spirits , did not appear to be disturbed by this , but joined in the general admiration without being at all confused . If I had any doubt of him , I suppose this half awakened it ; but I am inclined to believe that with the simple confidence of a child , and the natural reliance of a child upon superior years ( qualities I am very sorry any children should prematurely change for worldly wisdom ) , I had no serious mistrust of him on the whole , even then . I felt it rather hard , I must own , to be made , without deserving it , the subject of jokes between the coachman and guard as to the coach drawing heavy behind , on account of my sitting there , and as to the greater expediency of my travelling by waggon . The story of my supposed appetite getting wind among the outside passengers , they were merry upon it likewise ; and asked me whether I was going to be paid for , at school , as two brothers or three , and whether I was contracted for , or went upon the regular terms ; with other pleasant questions . But the worst of it was , that I knew I should be ashamed to eat anything , when an opportunity offered , and that , after a rather light dinner , I should remain hungry all night -- for I had left my cakes behind , at the hotel , in my hurry . My apprehensions were realized . When we stopped for supper I could n’t muster courage to take any , though I should have liked it very much , but sat by the fire and said I did n’t want anything . This did not save me from more jokes , either ; for a husky - voiced gentleman with a rough face , who had been eating out of a sandwich - box nearly all the way , except when he had been drinking out of a bottle , said I was like a boa - constrictor who took enough at one meal to last him a long time ; after which , he actually brought a rash out upon himself with boiled beef . We had started from Yarmouth at three o’clock in the afternoon , and we were due in London about eight next morning . It was Mid - summer weather , and the evening was very pleasant . When we passed through a village , I pictured to myself what the insides of the houses were like , and what the inhabitants were about ; and when boys came running after us , and got up behind and swung there for a little way , I wondered whether their fathers were alive , and whether they were happy at home . I had plenty to think of , therefore , besides my mind running continually on the kind of place I was going to -- which was an awful speculation . Sometimes , I remember , I resigned myself to thoughts of home and Peggotty ; and to endeavouring , in a confused blind way , to recall how I had felt , and what sort of boy I used to be , before I bit Mr. Murdstone : which I could n’t satisfy myself about by any means , I seemed to have bitten him in such a remote antiquity . The night was not so pleasant as the evening , for it got chilly ; and being put between two gentlemen ( the rough - faced one and another ) to prevent my tumbling off the coach , I was nearly smothered by their falling asleep , and completely blocking me up . They squeezed me so hard sometimes , that I could not help crying out , ‘
35721	35736	35708	35708	she	1294	‘ Come , do n’t YOU fidget . YOUR bones are young enough , I ’m
35739	36051	35708	35708	she	1294	’ At last the sun rose , and then my companions seemed to sleep easier . The difficulties under which they had laboured all night , and which had found utterance in the most terrific gasps and snorts , are not to be conceived . As the sun got higher , their sleep became lighter , and so they gradually one by one awoke . I recollect being very much surprised by the feint everybody made , then , of not having been to sleep at all , and by the uncommon indignation with which everyone repelled the charge . I labour under the same kind of astonishment to this day , having invariably observed that of all human weaknesses , the one to which our common nature is the least disposed to confess ( I can not imagine why ) is the weakness of having gone to sleep in a coach . What an amazing place London was to me when I saw it in the distance , and how I believed all the adventures of all my favourite heroes to be constantly enacting and re - enacting there , and how I vaguely made it out in my own mind to be fuller of wonders and wickedness than all the cities of the earth , I need not stop here to relate . We approached it by degrees , and got , in due time , to the inn in the Whitechapel district , for which we were bound . I forget whether it was the Blue Bull , or the Blue Boar ; but I know it was the Blue Something , and that its likeness was painted up on the back of the coach . The guard ’s eye lighted on me as he was getting down , and he said at the booking - office door : ‘
36078	36082	36127	36127	Copperfield	232	’ Nobody answered . ‘
36092	36100	36084	36084	Copperfield	232	’ said I , looking helplessly down . ‘
36136	36141	36127	36127	Copperfield	232	’ said the guard . ‘
36148	36874	36875	36875	You	1300	’ No . There was nobody . I looked anxiously around ; but the inquiry made no impression on any of the bystanders , if I except a man in gaiters , with one eye , who suggested that they had better put a brass collar round my neck , and tie me up in the stable . A ladder was brought , and I got down after the lady , who was like a haystack : not daring to stir , until her basket was removed . The coach was clear of passengers by that time , the luggage was very soon cleared out , the horses had been taken out before the luggage , and now the coach itself was wheeled and backed off by some hostlers , out of the way . Still , nobody appeared , to claim the dusty youngster from Blunderstone , Suffolk . More solitary than Robinson Crusoe , who had nobody to look at him and see that he was solitary , I went into the booking - office , and , by invitation of the clerk on duty , passed behind the counter , and sat down on the scale at which they weighed the luggage . Here , as I sat looking at the parcels , packages , and books , and inhaling the smell of stables ( ever since associated with that morning ) , a procession of most tremendous considerations began to march through my mind . Supposing nobody should ever fetch me , how long would they consent to keep me there ? Would they keep me long enough to spend seven shillings ? Should I sleep at night in one of those wooden bins , with the other luggage , and wash myself at the pump in the yard in the morning ; or should I be turned out every night , and expected to come again to be left till called for , when the office opened next day ? Supposing there was no mistake in the case , and Mr. Murdstone had devised this plan to get rid of me , what should I do ? If they allowed me to remain there until my seven shillings were spent , I could n’t hope to remain there when I began to starve . That would obviously be inconvenient and unpleasant to the customers , besides entailing on the Blue Whatever - it - was , the risk of funeral expenses . If I started off at once , and tried to walk back home , how could I ever find my way , how could I ever hope to walk so far , how could I make sure of anyone but Peggotty , even if I got back ? If I found out the nearest proper authorities , and offered myself to go for a soldier , or a sailor , I was such a little fellow that it was most likely they would n’t take me in . These thoughts , and a hundred other such thoughts , turned me burning hot , and made me giddy with apprehension and dismay . I was in the height of my fever when a man entered and whispered to the clerk , who presently slanted me off the scale , and pushed me over to him , as if I were weighed , bought , delivered , and paid for . As I went out of the office , hand in hand with this new acquaintance , I stole a look at him . He was a gaunt , sallow young man , with hollow cheeks , and a chin almost as black as Mr. Murdstone ’s ; but there the likeness ended , for his whiskers were shaved off , and his hair , instead of being glossy , was rusty and dry . He was dressed in a suit of black clothes which were rather rusty and dry too , and rather short in the sleeves and legs ; and he had a white neck - kerchief on , that was not over - clean . I did not , and do not , suppose that this neck - kerchief was all the linen he wore , but it was all he showed or gave any hint of . ‘
36876	36881	36882	36882	he	1301	’re the new boy ? ’
36885	36890	36882	36882	he	1301	‘ Yes , sir , ’
36904	36906	36899	36899	I	0	‘ I ’m
36915	37007	36899	36899	I	0	’ he said . I made him a bow and felt very much overawed . I was so ashamed to allude to a commonplace thing like my box , to a scholar and a master at Salem House , that we had gone some little distance from the yard before I had the hardihood to mention it . We turned back , on my humbly insinuating that it might be useful to me hereafter ; and he told the clerk that the carrier had instructions to call for it at noon . ‘
37014	37029	36899	36899	I	0	’ I said , when we had accomplished about the same distance as before , ‘
37034	37035	36899	36899	I	0	’ ‘
37042	37046	36899	36899	I	0	’ he said . ‘
37053	37058	37051	37051	sir	979	’ I diffidently asked . ‘
37065	37069	37070	37070	We	1308	’ he said . ‘
37085	37524	37525	37526	My Charley	1310	’ I was so faint and tired , that the idea of holding out for six miles more , was too much for me . I took heart to tell him that I had had nothing all night , and that if he would allow me to buy something to eat , I should be very much obliged to him . He appeared surprised at this -- I see him stop and look at me now -- and after considering for a few moments , said he wanted to call on an old person who lived not far off , and that the best way would be for me to buy some bread , or whatever I liked best that was wholesome , and make my breakfast at her house , where we could get some milk . Accordingly we looked in at a baker ’s window , and after I had made a series of proposals to buy everything that was bilious in the shop , and he had rejected them one by one , we decided in favour of a nice little loaf of brown bread , which cost me threepence . Then , at a grocer ’s shop , we bought an egg and a slice of streaky bacon ; which still left what I thought a good deal of change , out of the second of the bright shillings , and made me consider London a very cheap place . These provisions laid in , we went on through a great noise and uproar that confused my weary head beyond description , and over a bridge which , no doubt , was London Bridge ( indeed I think he told me so , but I was half asleep ) , until we came to the poor person ’s house , which was a part of some alms - houses , as I knew by their look , and by an inscription on a stone over the gate which said they were established for twenty - five poor women . The Master at Salem House lifted the latch of one of a number of little black doors that were all alike , and had each a little diamond - paned window on one side , and another little diamond -- paned window above ; and we went into the little house of one of these poor old women , who was blowing a fire to make a little saucepan boil . On seeing the master enter , the old woman stopped with the bellows on her knee , and said something that I thought sounded like ‘
37528	37553	37525	37526	My Charley	1310	’ but on seeing me come in too , she got up , and rubbing her hands made a confused sort of half curtsey . ‘
37569	37577	37566	37566	you	1311	’ said the Master at Salem House . ‘
37581	37587	37579	37579	I	0	’ said the old woman . ‘
37594	37595	37590	37590	I	0	’ ‘
37602	37643	37598	37599	Mrs. Fibbitson	300	’ said the Master , looking at another old woman in a large chair by the fire , who was such a bundle of clothes that I feel grateful to this hour for not having sat upon her by mistake . ‘
37650	37657	37646	37646	she	300	’ said the first old woman . ‘
37694	37938	37678	37678	I	0	’ As they looked at her , I looked at her also . Although it was a warm day , she seemed to think of nothing but the fire . I fancied she was jealous even of the saucepan on it ; and I have reason to know that she took its impressment into the service of boiling my egg and broiling my bacon , in dudgeon ; for I saw her , with my own discomfited eyes , shake her fist at me once , when those culinary operations were going on , and no one else was looking . The sun streamed in at the little window , but she sat with her own back and the back of the large chair towards it , screening the fire as if she were sedulously keeping IT warm , instead of it keeping her warm , and watching it in a most distrustful manner . The completion of the preparations for my breakfast , by relieving the fire , gave her such extreme joy that she laughed aloud -- and a very unmelodious laugh she had , I must say . I sat down to my brown loaf , my egg , and my rasher of bacon , with a basin of milk besides , and made a most delicious meal . While I was yet in the full enjoyment of it , the old woman of the house said to the Master : ‘
37947	37948	37940	37940	you	1313	’ ‘
37951	37955	37940	37940	you	1313	’ he returned . ‘
37962	37970	37940	37940	you	1313	’ said the old woman , coaxingly . ‘
37973	38459	37940	37940	you	1313	’ The Master , upon this , put his hand underneath the skirts of his coat , and brought out his flute in three pieces , which he screwed together , and began immediately to play . My impression is , after many years of consideration , that there never can have been anybody in the world who played worse . He made the most dismal sounds I have ever heard produced by any means , natural or artificial . I do n’t know what the tunes were -- if there were such things in the performance at all , which I doubt -- but the influence of the strain upon me was , first , to make me think of all my sorrows until I could hardly keep my tears back ; then to take away my appetite ; and lastly , to make me so sleepy that I could n’t keep my eyes open . They begin to close again , and I begin to nod , as the recollection rises fresh upon me . Once more the little room , with its open corner cupboard , and its square - backed chairs , and its angular little staircase leading to the room above , and its three peacock ’s feathers displayed over the mantelpiece -- I remember wondering when I first went in , what that peacock would have thought if he had known what his finery was doomed to come to -- fades from before me , and I nod , and sleep . The flute becomes inaudible , the wheels of the coach are heard instead , and I am on my journey . The coach jolts , I wake with a start , and the flute has come back again , and the Master at Salem House is sitting with his legs crossed , playing it dolefully , while the old woman of the house looks on delighted . She fades in her turn , and he fades , and all fades , and there is no flute , no Master , no Salem House , no David Copperfield , no anything but heavy sleep . I dreamed , I thought , that once while he was blowing into this dismal flute , the old woman of the house , who had gone nearer and nearer to him in her ecstatic admiration , leaned over the back of his chair and gave him an affectionate squeeze round the neck , which stopped his playing for a moment . I was in the middle state between sleeping and waking , either then or immediately afterwards ; for , as he resumed -- it was a real fact that he had stopped playing -- I saw and heard the same old woman ask Mrs. Fibbitson if it was n’t delicious ( meaning the flute ) , to which Mrs. Fibbitson replied , ‘
38466	38708	38709	38711	The new boy	9281	’ and nodded at the fire : to which , I am persuaded , she gave the credit of the whole performance . When I seemed to have been dozing a long while , the Master at Salem House unscrewed his flute into the three pieces , put them up as before , and took me away . We found the coach very near at hand , and got upon the roof ; but I was so dead sleepy , that when we stopped on the road to take up somebody else , they put me inside where there were no passengers , and where I slept profoundly , until I found the coach going at a footpace up a steep hill among green leaves . Presently , it stopped , and had come to its destination . A short walk brought us -- I mean the Master and me -- to Salem House , which was enclosed with a high brick wall , and looked very dull . Over a door in this wall was a board with SALEM HOUSE upon it ; and through a grating in this door we were surveyed when we rang the bell by a surly face , which I found , on the door being opened , belonged to a stout man with a bull - neck , a wooden leg , overhanging temples , and his hair cut close all round his head . ‘
38713	38777	38709	38711	The new boy	9281	’ said the Master . The man with the wooden leg eyed me all over -- it did n’t take long , for there was not much of me -- and locked the gate behind us , and took out the key . We were going up to the house , among some dark heavy trees , when he called after my conductor . ‘
38780	38810	38778	38778	Hallo	301	’ We looked back , and he was standing at the door of a little lodge , where he lived , with a pair of boots in his hand . ‘
38818	38822	38813	38814	The cobbler	1315	’ he said , ‘
38839	38864	38868	38868	he	1315	‘ em any more . He says there ai n’t a bit of the original boot left , and he wonders you expect it . ’
39126	39342	39348	39348	HE	1329	’ houses , made of the same materials , are scattered over the desks . Two miserable little white mice , left behind by their owner , are running up and down in a fusty castle made of pasteboard and wire , looking in all the corners with their red eyes for anything to eat . A bird , in a cage very little bigger than himself , makes a mournful rattle now and then in hopping on his perch , two inches high , or dropping from it ; but neither sings nor chirps . There is a strange unwholesome smell upon the room , like mildewed corduroys , sweet apples wanting air , and rotten books . There could not well be more ink splashed about it , if it had been roofless from its first construction , and the skies had rained , snowed , hailed , and blown ink through the varying seasons of the year . Mr. Mell having left me while he took his irreparable boots upstairs , I went softly to the upper end of the room , observing all this as I crept along . Suddenly I came upon a pasteboard placard , beautifully written , which was lying on the desk , and bore these words : ‘
39351	39409	39348	39348	HE	1329	’ I got upon the desk immediately , apprehensive of at least a great dog underneath . But , though I looked all round with anxious eyes , I could see nothing of him . I was still engaged in peering about , when Mr. Mell came back , and asked me what I did up there ? ‘
39417	39421	39412	39412	your	1330	’ says I , ‘
39427	39433	39423	39423	you	1330	’m looking for the dog . ’
39434	39437	39438	39438	he	979	‘ Dog ? ’
39441	39445	39438	39438	he	979	‘ What dog ? ’
39446	39455	39423	39423	you	1330	‘ Is n’t it a dog , sir ? ’
39456	39463	39423	39423	you	1330	‘ Is n’t what a dog ? ’
39464	39478	39438	39438	he	979	‘ That ’s to be taken care of , sir ; that bites . ’
39479	39484	39486	39486	he	979	‘ No , Copperfield , ’
39490	39533	39486	39486	he	979	‘ that ’s not a dog . That ’s a boy . My instructions are , Copperfield , to put this placard on your back . I am sorry to make such a beginning with you , but I must do it . ’
39680	39700	39668	39668	he	1337	‘ Hallo , you sir ! You Copperfield ! Show that badge conspicuous , or I ’ll report you ! ’
39871	39880	39867	39867	HE	864	‘ Take care of him . He bites . ’
40023	40032	40019	40019	his	302	‘ Take care of him . He bites ! ’
41128	41131	41133	41134	Mr. Creakle	303	‘ So ! ’
41136	41153	41133	41134	Mr. Creakle	303	‘ This is the young gentleman whose teeth are to be filed ! Turn him round . ’
41357	41360	41362	41363	Mr. Creakle	303	‘ Now , ’
41365	41374	41362	41363	Mr. Creakle	303	‘ What ’s the report of this boy ? ’
41375	41383	41385	41390	the man with the wooden leg	9344	‘ There ’s nothing against him yet , ’
41392	41399	41400	41400	I	0	‘ There has been no opportunity . ’
41438	41444	41446	41447	Mr. Creakle	303	‘ Come here , sir ! ’
41453	41457	41459	41468	the man with the wooden leg , repeating the gesture	1405	‘ Come here ! ’

41693	41702	41660	41661	Mr. Creakle	303	’ said the man with the wooden leg . ‘
41716	41721	41724	41724	I	0	’ said Mr. Creakle ; ‘
41739	41740	41724	41724	I	0	’ ‘
41753	41762	41747	41747	I	0	’ repeated the man with the wooden leg . ‘
41769	41774	41765	41767	a determined character	1409	’ said Mr. Creakle . ‘
41832	41833	41823	41829	the man with the wooden leg--‘been here	1411	’ ‘
41836	41841	41823	41829	the man with the wooden leg--‘been here	1411	’ was the answer . ‘
41844	41849	41850	41850	He	1411	’ said Mr. Creakle . ‘
41870	41888	41863	41863	I	0	’ said Mr. Creakle , striking his hand upon the table , and looking at Mrs. Creakle , ‘
41916	41979	41981	41981	you	0	’ I was very glad to be ordered away , for Mrs. and Miss Creakle were both wiping their eyes , and I felt as uncomfortable for them as I did for myself . But I had a petition on my mind which concerned me so nearly , that I could n’t help saying , though I wondered at my own courage : ‘
41985	41990	41984	41984	sir--	1413	’ Mr. Creakle whispered , ‘
41997	42016	41984	41984	sir--	1413	’ and bent his eyes upon me , as if he would have burnt me up with them . ‘
42023	42027	42018	42018	you	0	’ I faltered , ‘
42058	42337	42338	42338	Traddles	306	’ Whether Mr. Creakle was in earnest , or whether he only did it to frighten me , I do n’t know , but he made a burst out of his chair , before which I precipitately retreated , without waiting for the escort of the man with the wooden leg , and never once stopped until I reached my own bedroom , where , finding I was not pursued , I went to bed , as it was time , and lay quaking , for a couple of hours . Next morning Mr. Sharp came back . Mr. Sharp was the first master , and superior to Mr. Mell . Mr. Mell took his meals with the boys , but Mr. Sharp dined and supped at Mr. Creakle ’s table . He was a limp , delicate - looking gentleman , I thought , with a good deal of nose , and a way of carrying his head on one side , as if it were a little too heavy for him . His hair was very smooth and wavy ; but I was informed by the very first boy who came back that it was a wig ( a second - hand one HE said ) , and that Mr. Sharp went out every Saturday afternoon to get it curled . It was no other than Tommy Traddles who gave me this piece of intelligence . He was the first boy who returned . He introduced himself by informing me that I should find his name on the right - hand corner of the gate , over the top - bolt ; upon that I said , ‘
42340	42346	42338	42338	Traddles	306	’ to which he replied , ‘
42350	42424	42338	42338	Traddles	306	’ and then he asked me for a full account of myself and family . It was a happy circumstance for me that Traddles came back first . He enjoyed my placard so much , that he saved me from the embarrassment of either disclosure or concealment , by presenting me to every other boy who came back , great or small , immediately on his arrival , in this form of introduction , ‘
42433	42506	42510	42510	sir	979	’ Happily , too , the greater part of the boys came back low - spirited , and were not so boisterous at my expense as I had expected . Some of them certainly did dance about me like wild Indians , and the greater part could not resist the temptation of pretending that I was a dog , and patting and soothing me , lest I should bite , and saying , ‘
42512	42633	42510	42510	sir	979	’ and calling me Towzer . This was naturally confusing , among so many strangers , and cost me some tears , but on the whole it was much better than I had anticipated . I was not considered as being formally received into the school , however , until J. Steerforth arrived . Before this boy , who was reputed to be a great scholar , and was very good - looking , and at least half - a - dozen years my senior , I was carried as before a magistrate . He inquired , under a shed in the playground , into the particulars of my punishment , and was pleased to express his opinion that it was ‘
42637	42649	42510	42510	sir	979	’ ; for which I became bound to him ever afterwards . ‘
42658	42683	42684	42684	You	1418	’ he said , walking aside with me when he had disposed of my affair in these terms . I told him seven shillings . ‘
42696	42700	42684	42684	You	1418	’ he said . ‘
42719	42743	42714	42714	you	1418	’ I hastened to comply with his friendly suggestion , and opening Peggotty ’s purse , turned it upside down into his hand . ‘
42752	42757	42745	42745	you	1418	’ he asked me . ‘
42762	42766	42760	42760	you	0	’ I replied . ‘
42777	42781	42774	42774	you	1418	’ said Steerforth . ‘
42786	42787	42774	42774	you	1418	’ ‘
42795	42799	42791	42791	you	0	’ I repeated . ‘
42828	42832	42833	42833	You	1418	’ said Steerforth . ‘
42842	42863	42833	42833	You	1418	’ It certainly had not occurred to me before , but I said , Yes , I should like that . ‘
42867	42871	42833	42833	You	1418	’ said Steerforth . ‘
42891	42904	42887	42887	I	0	’ I said , Yes , I should like that , too . ‘
42920	42924	42925	42925	I	0	’ said Steerforth . ‘
42932	42936	42931	42931	you	232	’re going it ! ’
42955	42958	42960	42960	Steerforth	305	‘ Well ! ’
42962	43005	42960	42960	Steerforth	305	‘ We must make it stretch as far as we can ; that ’s all . I ’ll do the best in my power for you . I can go out when I like , and I ’ll smuggle the prog in . ’
43109	43125	43103	43103	he	0	’ worth , and laid it out on my bed in the moonlight , saying : ‘
43141	44038	43103	43103	he	0	’ I could n’t think of doing the honours of the feast , at my time of life , while he was by ; my hand shook at the very thought of it . I begged him to do me the favour of presiding ; and my request being seconded by the other boys who were in that room , he acceded to it , and sat upon my pillow , handing round the viands -- with perfect fairness , I must say -- and dispensing the currant wine in a little glass without a foot , which was his own property . As to me , I sat on his left hand , and the rest were grouped about us , on the nearest beds and on the floor . How well I recollect our sitting there , talking in whispers ; or their talking , and my respectfully listening , I ought rather to say ; the moonlight falling a little way into the room , through the window , painting a pale window on the floor , and the greater part of us in shadow , except when Steerforth dipped a match into a phosphorus - box , when he wanted to look for anything on the board , and shed a blue glare over us that was gone directly ! A certain mysterious feeling , consequent on the darkness , the secrecy of the revel , and the whisper in which everything was said , steals over me again , and I listen to all they tell me with a vague feeling of solemnity and awe , which makes me glad that they are all so near , and frightens me ( though I feign to laugh ) when Traddles pretends to see a ghost in the corner . I heard all kinds of things about the school and all belonging to it . I heard that Mr. Creakle had not preferred his claim to being a Tartar without reason ; that he was the sternest and most severe of masters ; that he laid about him , right and left , every day of his life , charging in among the boys like a trooper , and slashing away , unmercifully . That he knew nothing himself , but the art of slashing , being more ignorant ( J. Steerforth said ) than the lowest boy in the school ; that he had been , a good many years ago , a small hop - dealer in the Borough , and had taken to the schooling business after being bankrupt in hops , and making away with Mrs. Creakle ’s money . With a good deal more of that sort , which I wondered how they knew . I heard that the man with the wooden leg , whose name was Tungay , was an obstinate barbarian who had formerly assisted in the hop business , but had come into the scholastic line with Mr. Creakle , in consequence , as was supposed among the boys , of his having broken his leg in Mr. Creakle ’s service , and having done a deal of dishonest work for him , and knowing his secrets . I heard that with the single exception of Mr. Creakle , Tungay considered the whole establishment , masters and boys , as his natural enemies , and that the only delight of his life was to be sour and malicious . I heard that Mr. Creakle had a son , who had not been Tungay ’s friend , and who , assisting in the school , had once held some remonstrance with his father on an occasion when its discipline was very cruelly exercised , and was supposed , besides , to have protested against his father ’s usage of his mother . I heard that Mr. Creakle had turned him out of doors , in consequence ; and that Mrs. and Miss Creakle had been in a sad way , ever since . But the greatest wonder that I heard of Mr. Creakle was , there being one boy in the school on whom he never ventured to lay a hand , and that boy being J. Steerforth . Steerforth himself confirmed this when it was stated , and said that he should like to begin to see him do it . On being asked by a mild boy ( not me ) how he would proceed if he did begin to see him do it , he dipped a match into his phosphorus - box on purpose to shed a glare over his reply , and said he would commence by knocking him down with a blow on the forehead from the seven - and - sixpenny ink - bottle that was always on the mantelpiece . We sat in the dark for some time , breathless . I heard that Mr. Sharp and Mr. Mell were both supposed to be wretchedly paid ; and that when there was hot and cold meat for dinner at Mr. Creakle ’s table , Mr. Sharp was always expected to say he preferred cold ; which was again corroborated by J. Steerforth , the only parlour - boarder . I heard that Mr. Sharp ’s wig did n’t fit him ; and that he need n’t be so ‘
44042	44094	43103	43103	he	0	‘ bumptious’--about it , because his own red hair was very plainly to be seen behind . I heard that one boy , who was a coal - merchant ’s son , came as a set - off against the coal - bill , and was called , on that account , ‘
44240	44244	44231	44231	my	0	‘ My Charley ! ’
44323	44330	44332	44332	Steerforth	305	‘ Good night , young Copperfield , ’
44334	44342	44332	44332	Steerforth	305	‘ I ’ll take care of you . ’
44343	44345	44369	44370	a sister	1432	‘ You ’re
44349	44354	44369	44370	a sister	1432	’ I gratefully returned . ‘
44363	44364	44365	44365	You	305	’ ‘
44375	44381	44373	44373	you	305	’ said Steerforth , yawning . ‘
44384	44388	44373	44373	you	305	’ I answered . ‘
44394	44398	44373	44373	you	305	’ said Steerforth . ‘
44440	44441	44437	44438	young Copperfield	232	’ ‘
44447	44559	44445	44445	sir	979	’ I replied . I thought of him very much after I went to bed , and raised myself , I recollect , to look at him where he lay in the moonlight , with his handsome face turned up , and his head reclining easily on his arm . He was a person of great power in my eyes ; that was , of course , the reason of my mind running on him . No veiled future dimly glanced upon him in the moonbeams . There was no shadowy picture of his footsteps , in the garden that I dreamed of walking in all night . CHAPTER 7 . MY ‘
44562	44644	44771	44772	Mr. Creakle	303	’ AT SALEM HOUSE School began in earnest next day . A profound impression was made upon me , I remember , by the roar of voices in the schoolroom suddenly becoming hushed as death when Mr. Creakle entered after breakfast , and stood in the doorway looking round upon us like a giant in a story - book surveying his captives . Tungay stood at Mr. Creakle ’s elbow . He had no occasion , I thought , to cry out ‘
44647	44677	44771	44772	Mr. Creakle	303	’ so ferociously , for the boys were all struck speechless and motionless . Mr. Creakle was seen to speak , and Tungay was heard , to this effect . ‘
44692	44756	44771	44772	Mr. Creakle	303	’re about , in this new half . Come fresh up to the lessons , I advise you , for I come fresh up to the punishment . I wo n’t flinch . It will be of no use your rubbing yourselves ; you wo n’t rub the marks out that I shall give you . Now get to work , every boy ! ’
46547	46554	46555	46555	Steerforth	305	‘ And do you recollect them ? ’
46558	46562	46563	46563	I	0	‘ Oh yes , ’
46581	46591	46593	46593	Steerforth	305	‘ Then I tell you what , young Copperfield , ’
46595	46599	46593	46593	Steerforth	305	‘ you shall tell ‘
46629	46645	46625	46625	We	1481	‘ em one after another . We ’ll make some regular Arabian Nights of it . ’
46990	46993	46978	46978	Peggotty	234	‘ the half ’
47040	47052	47054	47054	he	305	‘ Now , I ’ll tell you what , young Copperfield , ’
47056	47073	47054	47054	he	305	‘ the wine shall be kept to wet your whistle when you are story - telling . ’
47987	48313	47972	47972	his	1513	’ names , no great impression was made by it , as they were pretty sure of getting into trouble tomorrow , do what they would , and thought it wise , no doubt , to enjoy themselves today . It was , properly , a half - holiday ; being Saturday . But as the noise in the playground would have disturbed Mr. Creakle , and the weather was not favourable for going out walking , we were ordered into school in the afternoon , and set some lighter tasks than usual , which were made for the occasion . It was the day of the week on which Mr. Sharp went out to get his wig curled ; so Mr. Mell , who always did the drudgery , whatever it was , kept school by himself . If I could associate the idea of a bull or a bear with anyone so mild as Mr. Mell , I should think of him , in connexion with that afternoon when the uproar was at its height , as of one of those animals , baited by a thousand dogs . I recall him bending his aching head , supported on his bony hand , over the book on his desk , and wretchedly endeavouring to get on with his tiresome work , amidst an uproar that might have made the Speaker of the House of Commons giddy . Boys started in and out of their places , playing at puss in the corner with other boys ; there were laughing boys , singing boys , talking boys , dancing boys , howling boys ; boys shuffled with their feet , boys whirled about him , grinning , making faces , mimicking him behind his back and before his eyes ; mimicking his poverty , his boots , his coat , his mother , everything belonging to him that they should have had consideration for . ‘
48316	48333	47972	47972	his	1513	’ cried Mr. Mell , suddenly rising up , and striking his desk with the book . ‘
48360	48469	48352	48352	you	1515	’ It was my book that he struck his desk with ; and as I stood beside him , following his eye as it glanced round the room , I saw the boys all stop , some suddenly surprised , some half afraid , and some sorry perhaps . Steerforth ’s place was at the bottom of the school , at the opposite end of the long room . He was lounging with his back against the wall , and his hands in his pockets , and looked at Mr. Mell with his mouth shut up as if he were whistling , when Mr. Mell looked at him . ‘
48475	48480	48472	48473	Mr. Steerforth	314	’ said Mr. Mell . ‘
48484	48491	48482	48482	yourself	314	’ said Steerforth , turning red . ‘
48498	48499	48494	48494	you	314	’ ‘
48503	48508	48494	48494	you	314	’ said Mr. Mell . ‘
48513	48517	48511	48511	yourself	314	’ said Steerforth , ‘
48523	48573	48520	48520	your	314	’ There was a titter , and some applause ; but Mr. Mell was so white , that silence immediately succeeded ; and one boy , who had darted out behind him to imitate his mother again , changed his mind , and pretended to want a pen mended . ‘
48580	48585	48575	48575	you	314	’ said Mr. Mell , ‘
48647	48648	48643	48643	you	314	’ ‘
48663	48669	48649	48649	I	0	’ said Steerforth , coolly ; ‘
48672	48680	48649	48649	I	0	’m not mistaken , as it happens . ’
48681	48696	48698	48699	Mr. Mell	302	‘ And when you make use of your position of favouritism here , sir , ’
48708	48713	48698	48699	Mr. Mell	302	‘ to insult a gentleman-- ’
48714	48720	48722	48722	Steerforth	314	‘ A what?--where is he ? ’
48729	48738	48725	48725	somebody	8964	‘ Shame , J. Steerforth ! Too bad ! ’
48794	48807	48808	48808	you	314	’ said Mr. Mell , with his lips trembling more and more , ‘
48834	48835	48829	48829	Copperfield	232	’ ‘
48839	48849	48836	48837	Young Copperfield	315	’ said Steerforth , coming forward up the room , ‘
48911	49019	48905	48905	you	314	’ I am not clear whether he was going to strike Mr. Mell , or Mr. Mell was going to strike him , or there was any such intention on either side . I saw a rigidity come upon the whole school as if they had been turned into stone , and found Mr. Creakle in the midst of us , with Tungay at his side , and Mrs. and Miss Creakle looking in at the door as if they were frightened . Mr. Mell , with his elbows on his desk and his face in his hands , sat , for some moments , quite still . ‘
49023	49052	49020	49021	Mr. Mell	302	’ said Mr. Creakle , shaking him by the arm ; and his whisper was so audible now , that Tungay felt it unnecessary to repeat his words ; ‘
49062	49063	49059	49059	I	0	’ ‘
49070	49092	49059	49059	I	0	’ returned the Master , showing his face , and shaking his head , and rubbing his hands in great agitation . ‘
49169	49243	49167	49167	sir	979	’ Mr. Creakle , looking hard at Mr. Mell , put his hand on Tungay ’s shoulder , and got his feet upon the form close by , and sat upon the desk . After still looking hard at Mr. Mell from his throne , as he shook his head , and rubbed his hands , and remained in the same state of agitation , Mr. Creakle turned to Steerforth , and said : ‘
49261	49318	49321	49321	he	979	’ Steerforth evaded the question for a little while ; looking in scorn and anger on his opponent , and remaining silent . I could not help thinking even in that interval , I remember , what a noble fellow he was in appearance , and how homely and plain Mr. Mell looked opposed to him . ‘
49330	49336	49321	49321	he	979	’ said Steerforth at length . ‘
49339	49353	49321	49321	he	979	’ repeated Mr. Creakle , with the veins in his forehead swelling quickly . ‘
49359	49360	49361	49361	He	979	’ ‘
49364	49368	49361	49361	He	979	’ said Steerforth . ‘
49381	49392	49393	49393	I	0	’ demanded Mr. Creakle , turning angrily on his assistant . ‘
49399	49407	49409	49409	I	0	’ he returned in a low voice , ‘
49430	49431	49420	49420	himself	1535	’ ‘
49436	49441	49442	49443	My stars	1536	’ said Mr. Creakle . ‘
49459	49495	49453	49453	Mr.	1537	’ ; and here Mr. Creakle folded his arms , cane and all , upon his chest , and made such a knot of his brows that his little eyes were hardly visible below them ; ‘
49516	49534	49504	49504	you	979	’ said Mr. Creakle , darting his head at him suddenly , and drawing it back again , ‘
49545	49546	49504	49504	you	979	’ ‘
49560	49565	49552	49552	sir	979	’ said Mr. Mell . ‘
49579	49585	49587	49587	he	1542	’ Here Steerforth struck in . ‘
49640	49691	49626	49626	I	0	’ Without considering , perhaps , whether there were any consequences to be taken , I felt quite in a glow at this gallant speech . It made an impression on the boys too , for there was a low stir among them , though no one spoke a word . ‘
49705	49710	49712	49712	you	305	’ said Mr. Creakle , ‘
49746	49753	49728	49728	you	305	’ Steerforth gave a short laugh . ‘
49762	49767	49760	49760	sir	979	’ said Mr. Creakle , ‘
49782	49811	49780	49780	Steerforth	305	’ If Mr. Mell looked homely , in my eyes , before the handsome boy , it would be quite impossible to say how homely Mr. Creakle looked . ‘
49817	49821	49813	49813	him	305	’ said Steerforth . ‘
49831	49836	49829	49829	Steerforth	305	’ cried Mr. Creakle . ‘
49847	49848	49841	49841	he	305	’ ‘
49863	49867	49857	49859	his near relation	1551	’ said Steerforth . ‘
49874	49933	49857	49859	his near relation	1551	’ He glanced at me , and Mr. Mell ’s hand gently patted me upon the shoulder . I looked up with a flush upon my face and remorse in my heart , but Mr. Mell ’s eyes were fixed on Steerforth . He continued to pat me kindly on the shoulder , but he looked at him . ‘
49946	49950	49937	49937	me	0	’ said Steerforth , ‘
49975	50006	49957	49957	I	0	’ Mr. Mell still looked at him , and still patted me kindly on the shoulder , and said to himself , in a whisper , if I heard right : ‘
50013	50029	49957	49957	I	0	’ Mr. Creakle turned to his assistant , with a severe frown and laboured politeness : ‘
50059	50060	50061	50061	He	1556	’ ‘
50070	50083	50085	50085	he	1556	’ returned Mr. Mell , in the midst of a dead silence ; ‘
50091	50092	50085	50085	he	1556	’ ‘
50104	50124	50102	50102	you	1552	’ said Mr. Creakle , putting his head on one side , and rolling his eyes round the school , ‘
50136	50137	50138	50138	I	0	’ ‘
50143	50147	50138	50138	I	0	’ he returned . ‘
50154	50159	50150	50150	you	1552	’ said Mr. Creakle . ‘
50166	50167	50168	50168	I	0	’ ‘
50181	50186	50170	50170	you	1552	’ replied the assistant . ‘
50201	50202	50203	50203	I	0	’ ‘
50212	50226	50203	50203	I	0	’ said Mr. Creakle , with his veins swelling again bigger than ever , ‘
50261	50262	50245	50246	Mr. Mell	302	’ ‘
50268	50275	50245	50246	Mr. Mell	302	’ answered Mr. Mell , rising , ‘
50280	50281	50282	50282	Sir	979	’ ‘
50287	50292	50282	50282	Sir	979	’ said Mr. Creakle . ‘
50308	50327	50306	50306	you	1552	’ said Mr. Mell , glancing round the room , and again patting me gently on the shoulders . ‘
50380	50705	50364	50365	a friend	1563	’ Once more he laid his hand upon my shoulder ; and then taking his flute and a few books from his desk , and leaving the key in it for his successor , he went out of the school , with his property under his arm . Mr. Creakle then made a speech , through Tungay , in which he thanked Steerforth for asserting ( though perhaps too warmly ) the independence and respectability of Salem House ; and which he wound up by shaking hands with Steerforth , while we gave three cheers -- I did not quite know what for , but I supposed for Steerforth , and so joined in them ardently , though I felt miserable . Mr. Creakle then caned Tommy Traddles for being discovered in tears , instead of cheers , on account of Mr. Mell ’s departure ; and went back to his sofa , or his bed , or wherever he had come from . We were left to ourselves now , and looked very blank , I recollect , on one another . For myself , I felt so much self - reproach and contrition for my part in what had happened , that nothing would have enabled me to keep back my tears but the fear that Steerforth , who often looked at me , I saw , might think it unfriendly -- or , I should rather say , considering our relative ages , and the feeling with which I regarded him , undutiful -- if I showed the emotion which distressed me . He was very angry with Traddles , and said he was glad he had caught it . Poor Traddles , who had passed the stage of lying with his head upon the desk , and was relieving himself as usual with a burst of skeletons , said he did n’t care . Mr. Mell was ill - used . ‘
50716	50720	50723	50723	you	1565	’ said Steerforth . ‘
50726	50730	50723	50723	you	1565	’ returned Traddles . ‘
50736	50740	50743	50743	you	1565	’ said Steerforth . ‘
50746	50750	50743	50743	you	1565	’ retorted Traddles . ‘
50761	50762	50763	50763	His	1564	’ ‘
50766	50771	50763	50763	His	1564	’ repeated Steerforth disdainfully . ‘
50832	51207	51208	51208	Visitors	1568	’ We thought this intention very noble in Steerforth , whose mother was a widow , and rich , and would do almost anything , it was said , that he asked her . We were all extremely glad to see Traddles so put down , and exalted Steerforth to the skies : especially when he told us , as he condescended to do , that what he had done had been done expressly for us , and for our cause ; and that he had conferred a great boon upon us by unselfishly doing it . But I must say that when I was going on with a story in the dark that night , Mr. Mell ’s old flute seemed more than once to sound mournfully in my ears ; and that when at last Steerforth was tired , and I lay down in my bed , I fancied it playing so sorrowfully somewhere , that I was quite wretched . I soon forgot him in the contemplation of Steerforth , who , in an easy amateur way , and without any book ( he seemed to me to know everything by heart ) , took some of his classes until a new master was found . The new master came from a grammar school ; and before he entered on his duties , dined in the parlour one day , to be introduced to Steerforth . Steerforth approved of him highly , and told us he was a Brick . Without exactly understanding what learned distinction was meant by this , I respected him greatly for it , and had no doubt whatever of his superior knowledge : though he never took the pains with me -- not that I was anybody -- that Mr. Mell had taken . There was only one other event in this half - year , out of the daily school - life , that made an impression upon me which still survives . It survives for many reasons . One afternoon , when we were all harassed into a state of dire confusion , and Mr. Creakle was laying about him dreadfully , Tungay came in , and called out in his usual strong way : ‘
51212	51502	51208	51208	Visitors	1568	’ A few words were interchanged between him and Mr. Creakle , as , who the visitors were , and what room they were to be shown into ; and then I , who had , according to custom , stood up on the announcement being made , and felt quite faint with astonishment , was told to go by the back stairs and get a clean frill on , before I repaired to the dining - room . These orders I obeyed , in such a flutter and hurry of my young spirits as I had never known before ; and when I got to the parlour door , and the thought came into my head that it might be my mother -- I had only thought of Mr. or Miss Murdstone until then -- I drew back my hand from the lock , and stopped to have a sob before I went in . At first I saw nobody ; but feeling a pressure against the door , I looked round it , and there , to my amazement , were Mr. Peggotty and Ham , ducking at me with their hats , and squeezing one another against the wall . I could not help laughing ; but it was much more in the pleasure of seeing them , than at the appearance they made . We shook hands in a very cordial way ; and I laughed and laughed , until I pulled out my pocket - handkerchief and wiped my eyes . Mr. Peggotty ( who never shut his mouth once , I remember , during the visit ) showed great concern when he saw me do this , and nudged Ham to say something . ‘
51509	51511	51513	51513	Ham	236	’ ! ’
51520	51528	51513	51513	Ham	236	‘ Why , how you have growed ! ’
51529	51534	51535	51535	I	0	‘ Am I grown ? ’
51567	51573	51513	51513	Ham	236	‘ Growed , Mas’r Davy bor ’
51580	51584	51513	51513	Ham	236	’ said Ham . ‘
51590	51621	51513	51513	Ham	236	’ said Mr. Peggotty . They made me laugh again by laughing at each other , and then we all three laughed until I was in danger of crying again . ‘
51632	51636	51626	51626	mama	8936	’ I said . ‘
51648	51649	51644	51645	old Peggotty	234	’ ‘
51652	51657	51644	51645	old Peggotty	234	’ said Mr. Peggotty . ‘

51672	51721	51722	51722	You	1572	’ said Mr. Peggotty . There was a silence . Mr. Peggotty , to relieve it , took two prodigious lobsters , and an enormous crab , and a large canvas bag of shrimps , out of his pockets , and piled them up in Ham ’s arms . ‘
51725	51730	51722	51722	You	1572	’ said Mr. Peggotty , ‘
51759	51768	51755	51760	The old Mawther biled ‘ em	9504	‘ em , she did . Mrs. Gummidge biled ‘
51773	51798	51799	51800	Mrs. Gummidge	267	’ said Mr. Peggotty , slowly , who I thought appeared to stick to the subject on account of having no other subject ready , ‘
51809	51812	51807	51807	she	267	‘ em . ’
51845	51869	51825	51825	Ham	236	‘ We come , you see , the wind and tide making in our favour , in one of our Yarmouth lugs to Gravesen ’
51897	51974	51873	51873	she	1574	’ , I was to come over and inquire for Mas’r Davy and give her dooty , humbly wishing him well and reporting of the fam’ly as they was oncommon toe - be - sure . Little Em’ly , you see , she ’ll write to my sister when I go back , as I see you and as you was similarly oncommon , and so we make it quite a merry - go - rounder . ’
52038	52056	52058	52059	Mr. Peggotty	234	‘ She ’s getting to be a woman , that ’s wot she ’s getting to be , ’
52061	52065	52066	52066	He	234	‘ Ask HIM . ’
52082	52087	52089	52090	Mr. Peggotty	234	‘ Her pretty face ! ’
52100	52104	52106	52106	Ham	236	‘ Her learning ! ’
52108	52112	52114	52115	Mr. Peggotty	234	‘ Her writing ! ’
52117	52138	52114	52115	Mr. Peggotty	234	‘ Why it ’s as black as jet ! And so large it is , you might see it anywheres . ’
52304	52316	52297	52297	he	316	‘ I did n’t know you were here , young Copperfield ! ’
52406	52445	52386	52386	I	0	‘ Do n’t go , Steerforth , if you please . These are two Yarmouth boatmen -- very kind , good people -- who are relations of my nurse , and have come from Gravesend to see me . ’
52446	52451	52453	52453	Steerforth	316	‘ Aye , aye ? ’
52457	52470	52453	52453	Steerforth	316	‘ I am glad to see them . How are you both ? ’
52605	52621	52622	52622	I	0	‘ You must let them know at home , if you please , Mr. Peggotty , ’
52625	52656	52622	52622	I	0	‘ when that letter is sent , that Mr. Steerforth is very kind to me , and that I do n’t know what I should ever do here without him . ’
52657	52660	52662	52662	Steerforth	314	‘ Nonsense ! ’
52666	52677	52662	52662	Steerforth	314	‘ You must n’t tell them anything of the sort . ’
52678	52693	52694	52694	I	0	‘ And if Mr. Steerforth ever comes into Norfolk or Suffolk , Mr. Peggotty , ’
52697	52744	52694	52694	I	0	‘ while I am there , you may depend upon it I shall bring him to Yarmouth , if he will let me , to see your house . You never saw such a good house , Steerforth . It ’s made out of a boat ! ’
52745	52755	52757	52757	Steerforth	314	‘ Made out of a boat , is it ? ’
52759	52776	52757	52757	Steerforth	314	‘ It ’s the right sort of a house for such a thorough - built boatman . ’
52777	52779	52694	52694	I	0	‘ So ‘
52785	52790	52792	52792	Ham	236	‘ tis , sir , ’
52796	52798	52792	52792	Ham	236	‘ You ’re
52807	52831	52832	52833	Mr. Peggotty	234	’ , gen’l’m’n ’s right . A thorough - built boatman ! Hor , hor ! That ’s what he is , too ! ’
52855	52860	52861	52861	he	234	‘ Well , sir , ’
52880	52901	52861	52861	he	234	‘ I thankee , sir , I thankee ! I do my endeavours in my line of life , sir . ’
52902	52915	52917	52917	Steerforth	314	‘ The best of men can do no more , Mr. Peggotty , ’
52926	52941	52943	52944	Mr. Peggotty	234	‘ I ’ll pound it , it ’s wot you do yourself , sir , ’
52950	52966	52947	52947	his	234	‘ and wot you do well -- right well ! I thankee , sir . I ’m
52981	52988	52947	52947	his	234	’m rough , sir , but I ’m
52997	53035	52994	52994	I	0	’m ready , you unnerstand . My house ai n’t much for to see , sir , but it ’s hearty at your service if ever you should come along with Mas’r Davy to see it . I ’m
53043	53085	53040	53040	I	0	’ said Mr. Peggotty , by which he meant snail , and this was in allusion to his being slow to go , for he had attempted to go after every sentence , and had somehow or other come back again ; ‘
53099	53195	53094	53094	I	0	’ Ham echoed this sentiment , and we parted with them in the heartiest manner . I was almost tempted that evening to tell Steerforth about pretty little Em’ly , but I was too timid of mentioning her name , and too much afraid of his laughing at me . I remember that I thought a good deal , and in an uneasy sort of way , about Mr. Peggotty having said that she was getting on to be a woman ; but I decided that was nonsense . We transported the shellfish , or the ‘
53197	53892	53893	53893	You	1594	’ as Mr. Peggotty had modestly called it , up into our room unobserved , and made a great supper that evening . But Traddles could n’t get happily out of it . He was too unfortunate even to come through a supper like anybody else . He was taken ill in the night -- quite prostrate he was -- in consequence of Crab ; and after being drugged with black draughts and blue pills , to an extent which Demple ( whose father was a doctor ) said was enough to undermine a horse ’s constitution , received a caning and six chapters of Greek Testament for refusing to confess . The rest of the half - year is a jumble in my recollection of the daily strife and struggle of our lives ; of the waning summer and the changing season ; of the frosty mornings when we were rung out of bed , and the cold , cold smell of the dark nights when we were rung into bed again ; of the evening schoolroom dimly lighted and indifferently warmed , and the morning schoolroom which was nothing but a great shivering - machine ; of the alternation of boiled beef with roast beef , and boiled mutton with roast mutton ; of clods of bread - and - butter , dog’s - eared lesson - books , cracked slates , tear - blotted copy - books , canings , rulerings , hair - cuttings , rainy Sundays , suet - puddings , and a dirty atmosphere of ink , surrounding all . I well remember though , how the distant idea of the holidays , after seeming for an immense time to be a stationary speck , began to come towards us , and to grow and grow . How from counting months , we came to weeks , and then to days ; and how I then began to be afraid that I should not be sent for and when I learnt from Steerforth that I had been sent for , and was certainly to go home , had dim forebodings that I might break my leg first . How the breaking - up day changed its place fast , at last , from the week after next to next week , this week , the day after tomorrow , tomorrow , today , tonight -- when I was inside the Yarmouth mail , and going home . I had many a broken sleep inside the Yarmouth mail , and many an incoherent dream of all these things . But when I awoke at intervals , the ground outside the window was not the playground of Salem House , and the sound in my ears was not the sound of Mr. Creakle giving it to Traddles , but the sound of the coachman touching up the horses . CHAPTER 8 . MY HOLIDAYS . ESPECIALLY ONE HAPPY AFTERNOON When we arrived before day at the inn where the mail stopped , which was not the inn where my friend the waiter lived , I was shown up to a nice little bedroom , with DOLPHIN painted on the door . Very cold I was , I know , notwithstanding the hot tea they had given me before a large fire downstairs ; and very glad I was to turn into the Dolphin ’s bed , pull the Dolphin ’s blankets round my head , and go to sleep . Mr. Barkis the carrier was to call for me in the morning at nine o’clock . I got up at eight , a little giddy from the shortness of my night ’s rest , and was ready for him before the appointed time . He received me exactly as if not five minutes had elapsed since we were last together , and I had only been into the hotel to get change for sixpence , or something of that sort . As soon as I and my box were in the cart , and the carrier seated , the lazy horse walked away with us all at his accustomed pace . ‘
53901	53950	53898	53899	Mr. Barkis	294	’ I said , thinking he would like to know it . Mr. Barkis rubbed his cheek with his cuff , and then looked at his cuff as if he expected to find some of the bloom upon it ; but made no other acknowledgement of the compliment . ‘
53959	53963	53964	53964	I	0	’ I said : ‘
53969	53970	53964	53964	I	0	’ ‘
53973	53987	53964	53964	I	0	’ said Mr. Barkis . Mr. Barkis seemed gruff , and answered drily . ‘
53996	54005	53993	53994	Mr. Barkis	294	’ I asked , after a little hesitation . ‘
54010	54015	53964	53964	I	0	’ said Mr. Barkis . ‘
54020	54021	53964	53964	I	0	’ ‘
54030	54035	53964	53964	I	0	’ said Mr. Barkis ; ‘
54044	54055	54061	54062	Mr. Barkis	294	’ Not understanding what he meant , I repeated inquisitively : ‘
54064	54065	54061	54062	Mr. Barkis	294	’ ‘
54071	54080	54061	54062	Mr. Barkis	294	’ he explained , looking at me sideways . ‘
54084	54085	54095	54096	Mr. Barkis	294	’ ‘
54098	54115	54095	54096	Mr. Barkis	294	’ said I , opening my eyes . For this was a new light to me . ‘
54123	54125	54127	54128	Mr. Barkis	294	’ , ’
54138	54153	54131	54131	his	8584	‘ it ’s as much as to say , that man ’s a - waitin ’
54158	54159	54131	54131	his	8584	’ ‘
54165	54166	54162	54163	Mr. Barkis	294	’ ‘
54169	54184	54185	54186	that man	9020	’ said Mr. Barkis , carrying his eyes back to his horse ’s ears ; ‘
54192	54199	54185	54186	that man	9020	’ for a answer ever since . ’
54200	54210	54131	54131	his	8584	‘ Have you told her so , Mr. Barkis ? ’
54211	54216	54218	54219	Mr. Barkis	294	‘ No -- no , ’
54225	54259	54218	54219	Mr. Barkis	294	‘ I ai n’t got no call to go and tell her so . I never said six words to her myself , I ai n’t a - goin’ to tell her so . ’
54260	54272	54274	54274	I	0	‘ Would you like me to do it , Mr. Barkis ? ’
54278	54288	54290	54291	Mr. Barkis	294	‘ You might tell her , if you would , ’
54300	54307	54290	54291	Mr. Barkis	294	‘ that Barkis was a - waitin ’
54320	54321	54313	54313	you	0	’ ‘
54325	54326	54322	54322	Her	1597	’ ‘
54329	54341	54342	54342	Peggotty	234	’ said Mr. Barkis , with a nod of his head . ‘
54344	54345	54342	54342	Peggotty	234	’ ‘
54353	54358	54313	54313	you	0	’ said Mr. Barkis . ‘
54374	54375	54372	54372	Clara	274	’ ‘
54380	54408	54372	54372	Clara	274	’ said Mr. Barkis . He seemed to find an immense fund of reflection in this circumstance , and sat pondering and inwardly whistling for some time . ‘
54411	54417	54419	54419	you	0	’ he resumed at length . ‘
54427	54468	54472	54472	you	0	’ for a answer . ” Says she , perhaps , “ Answer to what ? ” Says you , “ To what I told you . ” “ What is that ? ” says she . “ Barkis is willin ’
54474	54546	54472	54472	you	0	’ This extremely artful suggestion Mr. Barkis accompanied with a nudge of his elbow that gave me quite a stitch in my side . After that , he slouched over his horse in his usual manner ; and made no other reference to the subject except , half an hour afterwards , taking a piece of chalk from his pocket , and writing up , inside the tilt of the cart , ‘
55083	55089	55110	55110	she	740	‘ He is your brother , ’
55097	55108	55110	55110	she	740	‘ Davy , my pretty boy ! My poor child ! ’
55397	55400	55402	55403	my mother	740	‘ Peggotty , ’
55405	55411	55402	55403	my mother	740	‘ What ’s the matter ? ’
55446	55456	55458	55459	my mother	740	‘ What are you doing , you stupid creature ? ’
55463	55470	55472	55472	Peggotty	234	‘ Oh , drat the man ! ’
55474	55481	55472	55472	Peggotty	234	‘ He wants to marry me . ’
55482	55497	55499	55500	my mother	740	‘ It would be a very good match for you ; would n’t it ? ’
55502	55510	55512	55512	Peggotty	234	‘ Oh ! I do n’t know , ’
55514	55539	55512	55512	Peggotty	234	‘ Do n’t ask me . I would n’t have him if he was made of gold . Nor I would n’t have anybody . ’
55540	55555	55557	55558	my mother	740	‘ Then , why do n’t you tell him so , you ridiculous thing ? ’
55560	55565	55567	55567	Peggotty	234	‘ Tell him so , ’
55575	55611	55567	55567	Peggotty	234	‘ He has never said a word to me about it . He knows better . If he was to make so bold as say a word to me , I should slap his face . ’
55784	55797	55764	55764	she	1638	‘ Peggotty , dear , you are not going to be married ? ’
55798	55803	55805	55805	Peggotty	234	‘ Me , ma’am ? ’
55809	55816	55805	55805	Peggotty	234	‘ Lord bless you , no ! ’
55817	55822	55824	55825	my mother	740	‘ Not just yet ? ’
55829	55832	55834	55834	Peggotty	234	‘ Never ! ’
55845	55874	55836	55837	My mother	740	‘ Do n’t leave me , Peggotty . Stay with me . It will not be for long , perhaps . What should I ever do without you ! ’
55875	55883	55885	55885	Peggotty	234	‘ Me leave you , my precious ! ’
55887	55946	55885	55885	Peggotty	234	‘ Not for all the world and his wife . Why , what ’s put that in your silly little head?’--For Peggotty had been used of old to talk to my mother sometimes like a child . But my mother made no answer , except to thank her , and Peggotty went running on in her own fashion . ‘
55978	55991	55993	55993	she	1643	’ said Peggotty , shaking her head , and folding her arms ; ‘
56045	56096	56044	56044	I	0	’m too deaf , and too lame , and too blind , and too mumbly for want of teeth , to be of any use at all , even to be found fault with , than I shall go to my Davy , and ask him to take me in . ’
56097	56102	56104	56104	I	0	‘ And , Peggotty , ’
56106	56126	56104	56104	I	0	‘ I shall be glad to see you , and I ’ll make you as welcome as a queen . ’
56127	56133	56135	56135	Peggotty	234	‘ Bless your dear heart ! ’
56137	56143	56135	56135	Peggotty	234	‘ I know you will ! ’
56564	56568	56570	56570	Peggotty	234	‘ I wonder , ’
56587	56598	56570	56570	Peggotty	234	‘ what ’s become of Davy ’s great - aunt ? ’
56599	56604	56610	56610	herself	740	‘ Lor , Peggotty ! ’
56615	56621	56610	56610	herself	740	‘ what nonsense you talk ! ’
56622	56633	56635	56635	Peggotty	234	‘ Well , but I really do wonder , ma’am , ’
56637	56649	56651	56652	my mother	740	‘ What can have put such a person in your head ? ’
56654	56666	56610	56610	herself	740	‘ Is there nobody else in the world to come there ? ’
56667	56676	56678	56678	Peggotty	234	‘ I do n’t know how it is , ’
56680	56731	56678	56678	Peggotty	234	‘ unless it ’s on account of being stupid , but my head never can pick and choose its people . They come and they go , and they do n’t come and they do n’t go , just as they like . I wonder what ’s become of her ? ’
56732	56740	56742	56743	my mother	740	‘ How absurd you are , Peggotty ! ’
56745	56757	56742	56743	my mother	740	‘ One would suppose you wanted a second visit from her . ’
56758	56762	56764	56764	Peggotty	234	‘ Lord forbid ! ’
56766	56784	56786	56787	my mother	740	‘ Well then , do n’t talk about such uncomfortable things , there ’s a good soul , ’
56789	56824	56786	56787	my mother	740	‘ Miss Betsey is shut up in her cottage by the sea , no doubt , and will remain there . At all events , she is not likely ever to trouble us again . ’
56825	56828	56830	56830	Peggotty	234	‘ No ! ’
56832	56856	56830	56830	Peggotty	234	‘ No , that ai n’t likely at all.---I wonder , if she was to die , whether she ’d leave Davy anything ? ’
56857	56864	56866	56867	my mother	740	‘ Good gracious me , Peggotty , ’
56869	56896	56866	56867	my mother	740	‘ what a nonsensical woman you are ! when you know that she took offence at the poor dear boy ’s ever being born at all . ’
56897	56910	56912	56912	Peggotty	234	‘ I suppose she would n’t be inclined to forgive him now , ’
56914	56925	56912	56912	Peggotty	234	‘ Why should she be inclined to forgive him now ? ’
56933	56945	56947	56947	Peggotty	234	‘ Now that he ’s got a brother , I mean , ’
56967	56992	56994	56994	she	740	‘ As if this poor little innocent in its cradle had ever done any harm to you or anybody else , you jealous thing ! ’
56996	57015	56994	56994	she	740	‘ You had much better go and marry Mr. Barkis , the carrier . Why do n’t you ? ’
57016	57029	57031	57031	Peggotty	234	‘ I should make Miss Murdstone happy , if I was to , ’
57033	57043	57031	57031	Peggotty	234	‘ What a bad disposition you have , Peggotty ! ’
57048	57122	57123	57123	Peggotty	234	‘ You are as jealous of Miss Murdstone as it is possible for a ridiculous creature to be . You want to keep the keys yourself , and give out all the things , I suppose ? I should n’t be surprised if you did . When you know that she only does it out of kindness and the best intentions ! You know she does , Peggotty -- you know it well . ’
57130	57136	57123	57123	Peggotty	234	‘ Bother the best intentions ! ’
57157	57168	57170	57171	my mother	740	‘ I know what you mean , you cross thing , ’
57173	57246	57170	57171	my mother	740	‘ I understand you , Peggotty , perfectly . You know I do , and I wonder you do n’t colour up like fire . But one point at a time . Miss Murdstone is the point now , Peggotty , and you sha’n’t escape from it . Have n’t you heard her say , over and over again , that she thinks I am too thoughtless and too -- a -- a-- ’
57247	57250	57252	57252	Peggotty	234	‘ Pretty , ’
57254	57257	57252	57252	Peggotty	234	‘ Well , ’
57265	57284	57252	57252	Peggotty	234	‘ and if she is so silly as to say so , can I be blamed for it ? ’
57285	57292	57294	57294	Peggotty	234	‘ No one says you can , ’
57296	57306	57294	57294	Peggotty	234	‘ No , I should hope not , indeed ! ’
57311	57432	57294	57294	Peggotty	234	‘ Have n’t you heard her say , over and over again , that on this account she wished to spare me a great deal of trouble , which she thinks I am not suited for , and which I really do n’t know myself that I AM suited for ; and is n’t she up early and late , and going to and fro continually -- and does n’t she do all sorts of things , and grope into all sorts of places , coal - holes and pantries and I do n’t know where , that ca n’t be very agreeable -- and do you mean to insinuate that there is not a sort of devotion in that ? ’
57433	57441	57443	57443	Peggotty	234	‘ I do n’t insinuate at all , ’
57445	57451	57443	57443	Peggotty	234	‘ You do , Peggotty , ’
57456	57487	57443	57443	Peggotty	234	‘ You never do anything else , except your work . You are always insinuating . You revel in it . And when you talk of Mr. Murdstone ’s good intentions-- ’
57488	57493	57494	57494	em	1671	‘ I never talked of ‘
57496	57500	57494	57494	em	1671	’ said Peggotty . ‘
57505	57510	57503	57503	Peggotty	234	’ returned my mother , ‘
57725	57746	57747	57747	he	247	’ said my mother , with the tears which were engendered in her affectionate nature , stealing down her face , ‘
57804	57823	57826	57826	Peggotty	234	’ Peggotty sat with her chin on the foot of the stocking , looking silently at the fire . ‘
57828	57837	57826	57826	Peggotty	234	’ said my mother , changing her tone , ‘
57932	58388	57922	57922	you	234	’ Peggotty was not slow to respond , and ratify the treaty of friendship by giving me one of her best hugs . I think I had some glimpses of the real character of this conversation at the time ; but I am sure , now , that the good creature originated it , and took her part in it , merely that my mother might comfort herself with the little contradictory summary in which she had indulged . The design was efficacious ; for I remember that my mother seemed more at ease during the rest of the evening , and that Peggotty observed her less . When we had had our tea , and the ashes were thrown up , and the candles snuffed , I read Peggotty a chapter out of the Crocodile Book , in remembrance of old times -- she took it out of her pocket : I do n’t know whether she had kept it there ever since -- and then we talked about Salem House , which brought me round again to Steerforth , who was my great subject . We were very happy ; and that evening , as the last of its race , and destined evermore to close that volume of my life , will never pass out of my memory . It was almost ten o’clock before we heard the sound of wheels . We all got up then ; and my mother said hurriedly that , as it was so late , and Mr. and Miss Murdstone approved of early hours for young people , perhaps I had better go to bed . I kissed her , and went upstairs with my candle directly , before they came in . It appeared to my childish fancy , as I ascended to the bedroom where I had been imprisoned , that they brought a cold blast of air into the house which blew away the old familiar feeling like a feather . I felt uncomfortable about going down to breakfast in the morning , as I had never set eyes on Mr. Murdstone since the day when I committed my memorable offence . However , as it must be done , I went down , after two or three false starts half - way , and as many runs back on tiptoe to my own room , and presented myself in the parlour . He was standing before the fire with his back to it , while Miss Murdstone made the tea . He looked at me steadily as I entered , but made no sign of recognition whatever . I went up to him , after a moment of confusion , and said : ‘
58413	58414	58415	58415	I	0	’ ‘
58426	58480	58424	58424	David	256	’ he replied . The hand he gave me was the hand I had bitten . I could not restrain my eye from resting for an instant on a red spot upon it ; but it was not so red as I turned , when I met that sinister expression in his face . ‘
58488	58495	58483	58483	you	1686	’ I said to Miss Murdstone . ‘
58501	58518	58483	58483	you	1686	’ sighed Miss Murdstone , giving me the tea - caddy scoop instead of her fingers . ‘
58525	58526	58530	58530	ma’am	8495	’ ‘
58532	58533	58530	58530	ma’am	8495	’ ‘
58538	58539	58543	58543	ma’am	8495	’ ‘
58545	58546	58543	58543	ma’am	8495	’ ‘
58549	58554	58543	58543	ma’am	8495	’ said Miss Murdstone . ‘
58562	58708	58709	58709	My	0	’ She kept a calendar of the holidays in this way , and every morning checked a day off in exactly the same manner . She did it gloomily until she came to ten , but when she got into two figures she became more hopeful , and , as the time advanced , even jocular . It was on this very first day that I had the misfortune to throw her , though she was not subject to such weakness in general , into a state of violent consternation . I came into the room where she and my mother were sitting ; and the baby ( who was only a few weeks old ) being on my mother ’s lap , I took it very carefully in my arms . Suddenly Miss Murdstone gave such a scream that I all but dropped it . ‘
58713	58718	58711	58711	Jane	279	’ cried my mother . ‘
58728	58733	58725	58725	you	274	’ exclaimed Miss Murdstone . ‘
58741	58746	58739	58739	Jane	279	’ said my mother ; ‘
58749	58750	58751	58751	He	1694	’ ‘
58756	58761	58751	58751	He	1694	’ cried Miss Murdstone . ‘
58769	58859	58751	58751	He	1694	’ She was limp with horror ; but stiffened herself to make a dart at me , and take it out of my arms . Then , she turned faint ; and was so very ill that they were obliged to give her cherry brandy . I was solemnly interdicted by her , on her recovery , from touching my brother any more on any pretence whatever ; and my poor mother , who , I could see , wished otherwise , meekly confirmed the interdict , by saying : ‘
58870	58931	58868	58868	Jane	279	’ On another occasion , when we three were together , this same dear baby -- it was truly dear to me , for our mother ’s sake -- was the innocent occasion of Miss Murdstone ’s going into a passion . My mother , who had been looking at its eyes as it lay upon her lap , said : ‘
58937	58952	58953	58953	I	0	’ and looked at mine . I saw Miss Murdstone lay her beads down . ‘
58956	58963	58953	58953	I	0	’ said my mother , gently , ‘
58990	58991	58994	58994	you	0	’ ‘
59000	59005	59008	59008	Jane	279	’ said Miss Murdstone . ‘
59010	59026	59008	59008	Jane	279	’ faltered my mother , a little abashed by the harsh tone of this inquiry , ‘
59041	59042	59043	59043	Clara	274	’ ‘
59045	59053	59043	59043	Clara	274	’ said Miss Murdstone , rising angrily , ‘
59061	59062	59054	59054	you	274	’ ‘
59067	59072	59073	59075	A positive fool	1701	’ remonstrated my mother . ‘
59077	59082	59073	59075	A positive fool	1701	’ said Miss Murdstone . ‘
59135	59498	59499	59499	David	256	’ With that she stalked out , and made the door bang after her . In short , I was not a favourite with Miss Murdstone . In short , I was not a favourite there with anybody , not even with myself ; for those who did like me could not show it , and those who did not , showed it so plainly that I had a sensitive consciousness of always appearing constrained , boorish , and dull . I felt that I made them as uncomfortable as they made me . If I came into the room where they were , and they were talking together and my mother seemed cheerful , an anxious cloud would steal over her face from the moment of my entrance . If Mr. Murdstone were in his best humour , I checked him . If Miss Murdstone were in her worst , I intensified it . I had perception enough to know that my mother was the victim always ; that she was afraid to speak to me or to be kind to me , lest she should give them some offence by her manner of doing so , and receive a lecture afterwards ; that she was not only ceaselessly afraid of her own offending , but of my offending , and uneasily watched their looks if I only moved . Therefore I resolved to keep myself as much out of their way as I could ; and many a wintry hour did I hear the church clock strike , when I was sitting in my cheerless bedroom , wrapped in my little great - coat , poring over a book . In the evening , sometimes , I went and sat with Peggotty in the kitchen . There I was comfortable , and not afraid of being myself . But neither of these resources was approved of in the parlour . The tormenting humour which was dominant there stopped them both . I was still held to be necessary to my poor mother ’s training , and , as one of her trials , could not be suffered to absent myself . ‘
59501	59521	59499	59499	David	256	’ said Mr. Murdstone , one day after dinner when I was going to leave the room as usual ; ‘
59535	59536	59528	59528	you	256	’ ‘
59543	59557	59560	59560	David	256	’ said Miss Murdstone . I stood still , and hung my head . ‘
59562	59567	59560	59560	David	256	’ said Mr. Murdstone , ‘
59581	59582	59584	59585	the boy	9042	’ ‘
59599	59604	59584	59585	the boy	9042	’ remarked his sister , ‘
59624	59625	59619	59619	you	274	’ ‘
59635	59640	59626	59626	I	0	’ said my mother , ‘
59664	59665	59666	59666	I	0	’ ‘
59676	59681	59674	59674	Clara	274	’ returned Miss Murdstone , ‘
59711	59712	59718	59718	Jane	279	’ ‘
59720	59725	59718	59718	Jane	279	’ returned my mother , ‘
59731	59732	59726	59726	your	274	’ ‘
59746	59753	59744	59744	Clara	274	’ interposed Miss Murdstone , angrily . ‘
59761	59766	59755	59755	I	0	’ resumed my mother ; ‘
59819	59820	59821	59821	We	1718	’ ‘
59833	59846	59831	59831	Clara	274	’ returned Miss Murdstone , arranging the little fetters on her wrists . ‘
59909	59910	59911	59911	I	0	’ ‘
59916	59927	59911	59911	I	0	’ said Mr. Murdstone , in a low grave voice , ‘
59944	59945	59946	59946	Edward	276	’ ‘
59948	59955	59956	59956	you	276	’ replied my mother , timidly , ‘
59980	59981	59982	59982	You	274	’ ‘
59990	59994	59982	59982	You	274	’ he replied . ‘
60013	60024	60029	60029	Edward	276	’ My mother ’s lips moved , as if she answered ‘
60031	60038	60029	60029	Edward	276	’ but she said nothing aloud . ‘
60048	60063	60045	60045	I	0	’ said Mr. Murdstone , turning his head and his eyes stiffly towards me , ‘
60114	60115	60116	60116	I	0	’ ‘
60123	60127	60118	60118	your	0	’ I faltered . ‘
60140	60141	60118	60118	your	0	’ ‘
60152	60176	60150	60150	sir	979	’ he returned so fiercely , that I saw my mother involuntarily put out her trembling hand as if to interpose between us . ‘
60246	60254	60240	60240	I	0	’ Miss Murdstone gave a hoarse chuckle . ‘
60269	60273	60255	60255	I	0	’ he continued , ‘
60307	60322	60284	60284	I	0	’ He ordered me like a dog , and I obeyed like a dog . ‘
60327	60331	60284	60284	I	0	’ he said . ‘
60386	60395	60377	60377	I	0	’ addressing my mother in a lower voice , ‘
60416	60417	60377	60377	I	0	’ ‘
60425	60430	60431	60431	I	0	’ cried Miss Murdstone . ‘
60435	60442	60431	60431	I	0	’ he resumed , addressing me , ‘
60489	60874	60472	60472	you	256	’ I knew well -- better perhaps than he thought , as far as my poor mother was concerned -- and I obeyed him to the letter . I retreated to my own room no more ; I took refuge with Peggotty no more ; but sat wearily in the parlour day after day , looking forward to night , and bedtime . What irksome constraint I underwent , sitting in the same attitude hours upon hours , afraid to move an arm or a leg lest Miss Murdstone should complain ( as she did on the least pretence ) of my restlessness , and afraid to move an eye lest she should light on some look of dislike or scrutiny that would find new cause for complaint in mine ! What intolerable dulness to sit listening to the ticking of the clock ; and watching Miss Murdstone ’s little shiny steel beads as she strung them ; and wondering whether she would ever be married , and if so , to what sort of unhappy man ; and counting the divisions in the moulding of the chimney - piece ; and wandering away , with my eyes , to the ceiling , among the curls and corkscrews in the paper on the wall ! What walks I took alone , down muddy lanes , in the bad winter weather , carrying that parlour , and Mr. and Miss Murdstone in it , everywhere : a monstrous load that I was obliged to bear , a daymare that there was no possibility of breaking in , a weight that brooded on my wits , and blunted them ! What meals I had in silence and embarrassment , always feeling that there were a knife and fork too many , and that mine ; an appetite too many , and that mine ; a plate and chair too many , and those mine ; a somebody too many , and that I ! What evenings , when the candles came , and I was expected to employ myself , but , not daring to read an entertaining book , pored over some hard - headed , harder - hearted treatise on arithmetic ; when the tables of weights and measures set themselves to tunes , as ‘
60877	60880	60472	60472	you	256	’ , or ‘
60884	61017	60472	60472	you	256	’ ; when they would n’t stand still to be learnt , but would go threading my grandmother ’s needle through my unfortunate head , in at one ear and out at the other ! What yawns and dozes I lapsed into , in spite of all my care ; what starts I came out of concealed sleeps with ; what answers I never got , to little observations that I rarely made ; what a blank space I seemed , which everybody overlooked , and yet was in everybody ’s way ; what a heavy relief it was to hear Miss Murdstone hail the first stroke of nine at night , and order me to bed ! Thus the holidays lagged away , until the morning came when Miss Murdstone said : ‘
61025	61091	61092	61092	Clara	274	’ and gave me the closing cup of tea of the vacation . I was not sorry to go . I had lapsed into a stupid state ; but I was recovering a little and looking forward to Steerforth , albeit Mr. Creakle loomed behind him . Again Mr. Barkis appeared at the gate , and again Miss Murdstone in her warning voice , said : ‘
61094	61599	61092	61092	Clara	274	’ when my mother bent over me , to bid me farewell . I kissed her , and my baby brother , and was very sorry then ; but not sorry to go away , for the gulf between us was there , and the parting was there , every day . And it is not so much the embrace she gave me , that lives in my mind , though it was as fervent as could be , as what followed the embrace . I was in the carrier ’s cart when I heard her calling to me . I looked out , and she stood at the garden - gate alone , holding her baby up in her arms for me to see . It was cold still weather ; and not a hair of her head , nor a fold of her dress , was stirred , as she looked intently at me , holding up her child . So I lost her . So I saw her afterwards , in my sleep at school -- a silent presence near my bed -- looking at me with the same intent face -- holding up her baby in her arms . CHAPTER 9 . I HAVE A MEMORABLE BIRTHDAY I PASS over all that happened at school , until the anniversary of my birthday came round in March . Except that Steerforth was more to be admired than ever , I remember nothing . He was going away at the end of the half - year , if not sooner , and was more spirited and independent than before in my eyes , and therefore more engaging than before ; but beyond this I remember nothing . The great remembrance by which that time is marked in my mind , seems to have swallowed up all lesser recollections , and to exist alone . It is even difficult for me to believe that there was a gap of full two months between my return to Salem House and the arrival of that birthday . I can only understand that the fact was so , because I know it must have been so ; otherwise I should feel convinced that there was no interval , and that the one occasion trod upon the other ’s heels . How well I recollect the kind of day it was ! I smell the fog that hung about the place ; I see the hoar frost , ghostly , through it ; I feel my rimy hair fall clammy on my cheek ; I look along the dim perspective of the schoolroom , with a sputtering candle here and there to light up the foggy morning , and the breath of the boys wreathing and smoking in the raw cold as they blow upon their fingers , and tap their feet upon the floor . It was after breakfast , and we had been summoned in from the playground , when Mr. Sharp entered and said : ‘
61609	61656	61092	61092	Clara	274	’ I expected a hamper from Peggotty , and brightened at the order . Some of the boys about me put in their claim not to be forgotten in the distribution of the good things , as I got out of my seat with great alacrity . ‘
61663	61668	61661	61661	David	232	’ said Mr. Sharp . ‘
61681	61754	61755	61756	David Copperfield	232	’ I might have been surprised by the feeling tone in which he spoke , if I had given it a thought ; but I gave it none until afterwards . I hurried away to the parlour ; and there I found Mr. Creakle , sitting at his breakfast with the cane and a newspaper before him , and Mrs. Creakle with an opened letter in her hand . But no hamper . ‘
61758	61775	61755	61756	David Copperfield	232	’ said Mrs. Creakle , leading me to a sofa , and sitting down beside me . ‘
61795	61828	61785	61785	I	0	’ Mr. Creakle , at whom of course I looked , shook his head without looking at me , and stopped up a sigh with a very large piece of buttered toast . ‘
61842	61847	61785	61785	I	0	’ said Mrs. Creakle , ‘
61893	61900	61902	61902	you	232	’ I looked at her earnestly . ‘
61914	61923	61902	61902	you	232	’ said Mrs. Creakle , after a pause , ‘
61929	61934	61925	61925	they	1749	’ After another pause , ‘
61940	61961	61925	61925	they	1749	’ I trembled without distinctly knowing why , and still looked at her earnestly , making no attempt to answer . ‘
61964	61968	61969	61969	I	0	’ said she , ‘
61985	62024	61975	61975	I	0	’ A mist rose between Mrs. Creakle and me , and her figure seemed to move in it for an instant . Then I felt the burning tears run down my face , and it was steady again . ‘
62031	62040	62025	62025	She	1074	’ she added . I knew all now . ‘
62045	62711	62041	62041	She	1074	’ There was no need to tell me so . I had already broken out into a desolate cry , and felt an orphan in the wide world . She was very kind to me . She kept me there all day , and left me alone sometimes ; and I cried , and wore myself to sleep , and awoke and cried again . When I could cry no more , I began to think ; and then the oppression on my breast was heaviest , and my grief a dull pain that there was no ease for . And yet my thoughts were idle ; not intent on the calamity that weighed upon my heart , but idly loitering near it . I thought of our house shut up and hushed . I thought of the little baby , who , Mrs. Creakle said , had been pining away for some time , and who , they believed , would die too . I thought of my father ’s grave in the churchyard , by our house , and of my mother lying there beneath the tree I knew so well . I stood upon a chair when I was left alone , and looked into the glass to see how red my eyes were , and how sorrowful my face . I considered , after some hours were gone , if my tears were really hard to flow now , as they seemed to be , what , in connexion with my loss , it would affect me most to think of when I drew near home -- for I was going home to the funeral . I am sensible of having felt that a dignity attached to me among the rest of the boys , and that I was important in my affliction . If ever child were stricken with sincere grief , I was . But I remember that this importance was a kind of satisfaction to me , when I walked in the playground that afternoon while the boys were in school . When I saw them glancing at me out of the windows , as they went up to their classes , I felt distinguished , and looked more melancholy , and walked slower . When school was over , and they came out and spoke to me , I felt it rather good in myself not to be proud to any of them , and to take exactly the same notice of them all , as before . I was to go home next night ; not by the mail , but by the heavy night - coach , which was called the Farmer , and was principally used by country - people travelling short intermediate distances upon the road . We had no story - telling that evening , and Traddles insisted on lending me his pillow . I do n’t know what good he thought it would do me , for I had one of my own : but it was all he had to lend , poor fellow , except a sheet of letter - paper full of skeletons ; and that he gave me at parting , as a soother of my sorrows and a contribution to my peace of mind . I left Salem House upon the morrow afternoon . I little thought then that I left it , never to return . We travelled very slowly all night , and did not get into Yarmouth before nine or ten o’clock in the morning . I looked out for Mr. Barkis , but he was not there ; and instead of him a fat , short - winded , merry - looking , little old man in black , with rusty little bunches of ribbons at the knees of his breeches , black stockings , and a broad - brimmed hat , came puffing up to the coach window , and said : ‘
62715	62716	62719	62719	sir	979	’ ‘
62721	62722	62719	62719	sir	979	’ ‘
62736	62744	62733	62733	you	979	’ he said , opening the door , ‘
62756	62998	62746	62746	I	0	’ I put my hand in his , wondering who he was , and we walked away to a shop in a narrow street , on which was written OMER , DRAPER , TAILOR , HABERDASHER , FUNERAL FURNISHER , & amp;c . It was a close and stifling little shop ; full of all sorts of clothing , made and unmade , including one window full of beaver - hats and bonnets . We went into a little back - parlour behind the shop , where we found three young women at work on a quantity of black materials , which were heaped upon the table , and little bits and cuttings of which were littered all over the floor . There was a good fire in the room , and a breathless smell of warm black crape -- I did not know what the smell was then , but I know now . The three young women , who appeared to be very industrious and comfortable , raised their heads to look at me , and then went on with their work . Stitch , stitch , stitch . At the same time there came from a workshop across a little yard outside the window , a regular sound of hammering that kept a kind of tune : RAT -- tat - tat , RAT -- tat - tat , RAT -- tat - tat , without any variation . ‘
63001	63013	62746	62746	I	0	’ said my conductor to one of the three young women . ‘
63022	63023	63020	63020	Minnie	328	’ ‘
63035	63044	63020	63020	Minnie	328	’ she replied gaily , without looking up . ‘
63053	63087	63051	63051	father	8844	’ Mr. Omer took off his broad - brimmed hat , and sat down and panted . He was so fat that he was obliged to pant some time before he could say : ‘
63092	63093	63094	63094	Father	329	’ ‘
63096	63102	63094	63094	Father	329	’ said Minnie , playfully . ‘
63110	63111	63094	63094	Father	329	’ ‘
63125	63133	63114	63114	I	0	’ he replied , considering about it . ‘
63139	63140	63134	63134	I	0	’ ‘
63151	63155	63141	63141	You	1757	’ said Minnie . ‘
63162	63163	63156	63156	You	1757	’ ‘
63167	63174	63176	63177	Mr. Omer	326	‘ em otherwise , my dear , ’
63179	63184	63176	63177	Mr. Omer	326	‘ No , indeed , ’
63189	63206	63176	63177	Mr. Omer	326	‘ We are all pretty gay here , thank Heaven ! Ai n’t we , father ? ’
63207	63215	63217	63218	Mr. Omer	326	‘ I hope so , my dear , ’
63220	63248	63217	63218	Mr. Omer	326	‘ As I have got my breath now , I think I ’ll measure this young scholar . Would you walk into the shop , Master Copperfield ? ’
63322	63326	63304	63304	he	326	‘ just come up ’
63337	63341	63334	63334	he	326	‘ just gone out ’
63343	63360	63362	63363	Mr. Omer	326	‘ And by that sort of thing we very often lose a little mint of money , ’
63365	63420	63362	63363	Mr. Omer	326	‘ But fashions are like human beings . They come in , nobody knows when , why , or how ; and they go out , nobody knows when , why , or how . Everything is like life , in my opinion , if you look at it in that point of view . ’
63475	63487	63459	63459	He	326	‘ Bring up that tea and bread - and - butter ! ’
63536	63544	63546	63547	Mr. Omer	326	‘ I have been acquainted with you , ’
63576	63591	63546	63547	Mr. Omer	326	‘ I have been acquainted with you a long time , my young friend . ’
63592	63598	63546	63547	Mr. Omer	326	‘ Have you , sir ? ’
63599	63604	63606	63607	Mr. Omer	326	‘ All your life , ’
63609	63647	63606	63607	Mr. Omer	326	‘ I may say before it . I knew your father before you . He was five foot nine and a half , and he lays in five - and - twen - ty foot of ground . ’
63648	63667	63546	63547	Mr. Omer	326	‘ RAT -- tat - tat , RAT -- tat - tat , RAT -- tat - tat , ’
63672	63692	63694	63695	Mr. Omer	326	‘ He lays in five and twen - ty foot of ground , if he lays in a fraction , ’
63699	63713	63694	63695	Mr. Omer	326	‘ It was either his request or her direction , I forget which . ’
63714	63726	63727	63727	I	0	‘ Do you know how my little brother is , sir ? ’
63736	63755	63733	63733	his	326	‘ RAT -- tat - tat , RAT -- tat - tat , RAT -- tat - tat . ’
63756	63765	63767	63767	he	326	‘ He is in his mother ’s arms , ’
63769	63780	63767	63767	he	326	‘ Oh , poor little fellow ! Is he dead ? ’
63781	63792	63794	63795	Mr. Omer	326	‘ Do n’t mind it more than you can help , ’
63797	63805	63794	63795	Mr. Omer	326	‘ Yes . The baby ’s dead . ’
63959	63964	63966	63967	Mr. Omer	326	‘ Well , Joram ! ’
63969	63976	63966	63967	Mr. Omer	326	‘ How do you get on ? ’
63977	63981	63983	63983	Joram	330	‘ All right , ’
63985	63990	63983	63983	Joram	330	‘ Done , sir . ’
64006	64032	64034	64035	Mr. Omer	326	‘ What ! you were at it by candle - light last night , when I was at the club , then ? Were you ? ’
64042	64045	64047	64047	Joram	330	‘ Yes , ’
64049	64079	64047	64047	Joram	330	‘ As you said we could make a little trip of it , and go over together , if it was done , Minnie and me -- and you . ’
64080	64094	64096	64097	Mr. Omer	326	‘ Oh ! I thought you were going to leave me out altogether , ’
64104	64115	64117	64119	the young man	1774	‘ --As you was so good as to say that , ’
64121	64142	64117	64119	the young man	1774	‘ why I turned to with a will , you see . Will you give me your opinion of it ? ’
64143	64147	64149	64150	Mr. Omer	326	‘ I will , ’
64154	64157	64160	64160	he	1774	‘ My dear ’
64167	64174	64160	64160	he	1774	‘ would you like to see your-- ’
64175	64180	64181	64181	Minnie	328	‘ No , father , ’
64184	64195	64197	64198	Mr. Omer	326	‘ I thought it might be agreeable , my dear , ’
64200	64204	64197	64198	Mr. Omer	326	‘ But perhaps you ’re
64207	65060	64197	64198	Mr. Omer	326	’ I ca n’t say how I knew it was my dear , dear mother ’s coffin that they went to look at . I had never heard one making ; I had never seen one that I know of.--but it came into my mind what the noise was , while it was going on ; and when the young man entered , I am sure I knew what he had been doing . The work being now finished , the two girls , whose names I had not heard , brushed the shreds and threads from their dresses , and went into the shop to put that to rights , and wait for customers . Minnie stayed behind to fold up what they had made , and pack it in two baskets . This she did upon her knees , humming a lively little tune the while . Joram , who I had no doubt was her lover , came in and stole a kiss from her while she was busy ( he did n’t appear to mind me , at all ) , and said her father was gone for the chaise , and he must make haste and get himself ready . Then he went out again ; and then she put her thimble and scissors in her pocket , and stuck a needle threaded with black thread neatly in the bosom of her gown , and put on her outer clothing smartly , at a little glass behind the door , in which I saw the reflection of her pleased face . All this I observed , sitting at the table in the corner with my head leaning on my hand , and my thoughts running on very different things . The chaise soon came round to the front of the shop , and the baskets being put in first , I was put in next , and those three followed . I remember it as a kind of half chaise - cart , half pianoforte - van , painted of a sombre colour , and drawn by a black horse with a long tail . There was plenty of room for us all . I do not think I have ever experienced so strange a feeling in my life ( I am wiser now , perhaps ) as that of being with them , remembering how they had been employed , and seeing them enjoy the ride . I was not angry with them ; I was more afraid of them , as if I were cast away among creatures with whom I had no community of nature . They were very cheerful . The old man sat in front to drive , and the two young people sat behind him , and whenever he spoke to them leaned forward , the one on one side of his chubby face and the other on the other , and made a great deal of him . They would have talked to me too , but I held back , and moped in my corner ; scared by their love - making and hilarity , though it was far from boisterous , and almost wondering that no judgement came upon them for their hardness of heart . So , when they stopped to bait the horse , and ate and drank and enjoyed themselves , I could touch nothing that they touched , but kept my fast unbroken . So , when we reached home , I dropped out of the chaise behind , as quickly as possible , that I might not be in their company before those solemn windows , looking blindly on me like closed eyes once bright . And oh , how little need I had had to think what would move me to tears when I came back -- seeing the window of my mother ’s room , and next it that which , in the better time , was mine ! I was in Peggotty ’s arms before I got to the door , and she took me into the house . Her grief burst out when she first saw me ; but she controlled it soon , and spoke in whispers , and walked softly , as if the dead could be disturbed . She had not been in bed , I found , for a long time . She sat up at night still , and watched . As long as her poor dear pretty was above the ground , she said , she would never desert her . Mr. Murdstone took no heed of me when I went into the parlour where he was , but sat by the fireside , weeping silently , and pondering in his elbow - chair . Miss Murdstone , who was busy at her writing - desk , which was covered with letters and papers , gave me her cold finger - nails , and asked me , in an iron whisper , if I had been measured for my mourning . I said : ‘
65063	65064	64197	64198	Mr. Omer	326	’ ‘
65069	65074	65076	65076	you	1775	’ said Miss Murdstone ; ‘
65078	65082	65103	65103	her	1775	‘ em home ? ’
65083	65096	65103	65103	her	1775	‘ Yes , ma’am . I have brought home all my clothes . ’
65517	65524	65514	65514	I	0	‘ Oh no ! oh no ! ’
65618	65625	65626	65626	he	237	‘ And how is Master David ? ’
65651	65655	65657	65658	Mr. Chillip	237	‘ Dear me ! ’
65670	65688	65667	65667	his	237	‘ Our little friends grow up around us . They grow out of our knowledge , ma’am ? ’
65700	65710	65712	65713	Mr. Chillip	237	‘ There is a great improvement here , ma’am ? ’
65975	65988	65957	65958	the clergyman	8619	‘ I am the Resurrection and the Life , saith the Lord ! ’
66040	66044	66033	66034	the Lord	9795	‘ Well done . ’
66379	66385	66387	66387	Peggotty	234	‘ She was never well , ’
66389	66488	66387	66387	Peggotty	234	‘ for a long time . She was uncertain in her mind , and not happy . When her baby was born , I thought at first she would get better , but she was more delicate , and sunk a little every day . She used to like to sit alone before her baby came , and then she cried ; but afterwards she used to sing to it -- so soft , that I once thought , when I heard her , it was like a voice up in the air , that was rising away . ‘
66542	66557	66528	66528	She	1823	’ Here Peggotty stopped , and softly beat upon my hand a little while . ‘
66617	66709	66721	66721	she	1830	‘ She tried to hold up after that ; and many a time , when they told her she was thoughtless and light - hearted , made believe to be so ; but it was all a bygone then . She never told her husband what she had told me -- she was afraid of saying it to anybody else -- till one night , a little more than a week before it happened , when she said to him : “ My dear , I think I am dying . ” ‘
66800	66807	66809	66809	Peggotty	234	‘ I never left her afterwards , ’
66811	66873	66809	66809	Peggotty	234	‘ She often talked to them two downstairs -- for she loved them ; she could n’t bear not to love anyone who was about her -- but when they went away from her bed - side , she always turned to me , as if there was rest where Peggotty was , and never fell asleep in any other way . ‘
66974	66988	66947	66947	she	1835	’ Another silence followed this , and another gentle beating on my hand . ‘
66997	67001	67003	67003	she	1835	’ said Peggotty , ‘
67028	67212	67012	67012	she	1835	‘ Daybreak had come , and the sun was rising , when she said to me , how kind and considerate Mr. Copperfield had always been to her , and how he had borne with her , and told her , when she doubted herself , that a loving heart was better and stronger than wisdom , and that he was a happy man in hers . “ Peggotty , my dear , ” she said then , “ put me nearer to you , ” for she was very weak . “ Lay your good arm underneath my neck , ” she said , “ and turn me to you , for your face is going far off , and I want it to be near . ” I put it as she asked ; and oh Davy ! the time had come when my first parting words to you were true -- when she was glad to lay her poor head on her stupid cross old Peggotty ’s arm -- and she died like a child that had gone to sleep ! ’
67942	67945	67946	67946	I	0	‘ Peggotty , ’
67967	68002	67946	67946	I	0	‘ Mr. Murdstone likes me less than he used to . He never liked me much , Peggotty ; but he would rather not even see me now , if he can help it . ’
68003	68010	68012	68012	Peggotty	234	‘ Perhaps it ’s his sorrow , ’
68018	68062	68012	68012	Peggotty	234	‘ I am sure , Peggotty , I am sorry too . If I believed it was his sorrow , I should not think of it at all . But it ’s not that ; oh , no , it ’s not that . ’
68063	68073	68075	68075	Peggotty	234	‘ How do you know it ’s not that ? ’
68081	68125	68075	68075	Peggotty	234	‘ Oh , his sorrow is another and quite a different thing . He is sorry at this moment , sitting by the fireside with Miss Murdstone ; but if I was to go in , Peggotty , he would be something besides . ’
68126	68132	68134	68134	Peggotty	234	‘ What would he be ? ’
68136	68139	68134	68134	Peggotty	234	‘ Angry , ’
68152	68181	68140	68140	I	0	‘ If he was only sorry , he would n’t look at me as he does . I am only sorry , and it makes me feel kinder . ’
68201	68204	68205	68205	she	1862	‘ Davy , ’
68210	68215	68205	68205	she	1862	‘ Yes , Peggotty ? ’
68216	68269	68140	68140	I	0	‘ I have tried , my dear , all ways I could think of -- all the ways there are , and all the ways there ai n’t , in short -- to get a suitable service here , in Blunderstone ; but there ’s no such a thing , my love . ’
68270	68281	68283	68283	I	0	‘ And what do you mean to do , Peggotty , ’
68287	68298	68283	68283	I	0	‘ Do you mean to go and seek your fortune ? ’
68299	68311	68313	68313	Peggotty	234	‘ I expect I shall be forced to go to Yarmouth , ’
68315	68320	68313	68313	Peggotty	234	‘ and live there . ’
68321	68329	68330	68330	I	0	‘ You might have gone farther off , ’
68337	68374	68330	68330	I	0	‘ and been as bad as lost . I shall see you sometimes , my dear old Peggotty , there . You wo n’t be quite at the other end of the world , will you ? ’
68375	68382	68384	68384	Peggotty	234	‘ Contrary ways , please God ! ’
68390	68423	68384	68384	Peggotty	234	‘ As long as you are here , my pet , I shall come over every week of my life to see you . One day , every week of my life ! ’
68451	68453	68445	68445	Peggotty	234	‘ I ’m
68525	68718	68515	68515	you	232	’ If anything , short of being in a different relation to every one about me , Peggotty excepted , could have given me a sense of pleasure at that time , it would have been this project of all others . The idea of being again surrounded by those honest faces , shining welcome on me ; of renewing the peacefulness of the sweet Sunday morning , when the bells were ringing , the stones dropping in the water , and the shadowy ships breaking through the mist ; of roaming up and down with little Em’ly , telling her my troubles , and finding charms against them in the shells and pebbles on the beach ; made a calm in my heart . It was ruffled next moment , to be sure , by a doubt of Miss Murdstone ’s giving her consent ; but even that was set at rest soon , for she came out to take an evening grope in the store - closet while we were yet in conversation , and Peggotty , with a boldness that amazed me , broached the topic on the spot . ‘
68726	68738	68719	68720	The boy	9042	’ said Miss Murdstone , looking into a pickle - jar , ‘
68767	68791	68754	68754	he	9042	’ Peggotty had an angry answer ready , I could see ; but she swallowed it for my sake , and remained silent . ‘
68794	68807	68754	68754	he	9042	’ said Miss Murdstone , still keeping her eye on the pickles ; ‘
68842	69144	68836	68836	I	0	’ I thanked her , without making any demonstration of joy , lest it should induce her to withdraw her assent . Nor could I help thinking this a prudent course , since she looked at me out of the pickle - jar , with as great an access of sourness as if her black eyes had absorbed its contents . However , the permission was given , and was never retracted ; for when the month was out , Peggotty and I were ready to depart . Mr. Barkis came into the house for Peggotty ’s boxes . I had never known him to pass the garden - gate before , but on this occasion he came into the house . And he gave me a look as he shouldered the largest box and went out , which I thought had meaning in it , if meaning could ever be said to find its way into Mr. Barkis ’s visage . Peggotty was naturally in low spirits at leaving what had been her home so many years , and where the two strong attachments of her life -- for my mother and myself -- had been formed . She had been walking in the churchyard , too , very early ; and she got into the cart , and sat in it with her handkerchief at her eyes . So long as she remained in this condition , Mr. Barkis gave no sign of life whatever . He sat in his usual place and attitude like a great stuffed figure . But when she began to look about her , and to speak to me , he nodded his head and grinned several times . I have not the least notion at whom , or what he meant by it . ‘
69154	69164	69151	69152	Mr. Barkis	294	’ I said , as an act of politeness . ‘
69170	69186	69151	69152	Mr. Barkis	294	’ said Mr. Barkis , who generally qualified his speech , and rarely committed himself . ‘
69196	69204	69193	69194	Mr. Barkis	294	’ I remarked , for his satisfaction . ‘
69210	69233	69206	69206	she	1868	’ said Mr. Barkis . After reflecting about it , with a sagacious air , Mr. Barkis eyed her , and said : ‘
69239	69249	69235	69235	you	234	’ Peggotty laughed , and answered in the affirmative . ‘
69261	69281	69283	69283	you	234	’ growled Mr. Barkis , sliding nearer to her on the seat , and nudging her with his elbow . ‘
69296	69430	69292	69292	you	234	’ At each of these inquiries Mr. Barkis shuffled nearer to her , and gave her another nudge ; so that at last we were all crowded together in the left - hand corner of the cart , and I was so squeezed that I could hardly bear it . Peggotty calling his attention to my sufferings , Mr. Barkis gave me a little more room at once , and got away by degrees . But I could not help observing that he seemed to think he had hit upon a wonderful expedient for expressing himself in a neat , agreeable , and pointed manner , without the inconvenience of inventing conversation . He manifestly chuckled over it for some time . By and by he turned to Peggotty again , and repeating , ‘
69437	69711	69712	69712	I	0	’ bore down upon us as before , until the breath was nearly edged out of my body . By and by he made another descent upon us with the same inquiry , and the same result . At length , I got up whenever I saw him coming , and standing on the foot - board , pretended to look at the prospect ; after which I did very well . He was so polite as to stop at a public - house , expressly on our account , and entertain us with broiled mutton and beer . Even when Peggotty was in the act of drinking , he was seized with one of those approaches , and almost choked her . But as we drew nearer to the end of our journey , he had more to do and less time for gallantry ; and when we got on Yarmouth pavement , we were all too much shaken and jolted , I apprehend , to have any leisure for anything else . Mr. Peggotty and Ham waited for us at the old place . They received me and Peggotty in an affectionate manner , and shook hands with Mr. Barkis , who , with his hat on the very back of his head , and a shame - faced leer upon his countenance , and pervading his very legs , presented but a vacant appearance , I thought . They each took one of Peggotty ’s trunks , and we were going away , when Mr. Barkis solemnly made a sign to me with his forefinger to come under an archway . ‘
69715	69720	69712	69712	I	0	’ growled Mr. Barkis , ‘
69726	69745	69712	69712	I	0	’ I looked up into his face , and answered , with an attempt to be very profound : ‘
69748	69749	69712	69712	I	0	’ ‘
69759	69767	69712	69712	I	0	’ said Mr. Barkis , nodding confidentially . ‘
69773	69778	69712	69712	I	0	’ Again I answered , ‘
69781	69782	69712	69712	I	0	’ ‘
69788	69790	69792	69793	my friend	1089	’ , ’
69795	69804	69792	69793	my friend	1089	‘ It was Barkis , and Barkis only . ’
69809	69815	69817	69818	Mr. Barkis	294	‘ It ’s all right , ’
69823	69825	69817	69818	Mr. Barkis	294	‘ I ’m
69844	69931	69933	69933	his	1873	’ In his attempts to be particularly lucid , Mr. Barkis was so extremely mysterious , that I might have stood looking in his face for an hour , and most assuredly should have got as much information out of it as out of the face of a clock that had stopped , but for Peggotty ’s calling me away . As we were going along , she asked me what he had said ; and I told her he had said it was all right . ‘
69936	69940	69933	69933	his	1873	’ said Peggotty , ‘
69964	69965	69953	69953	you	1874	’ ‘
69985	70037	69970	69970	you	1874	’ I returned , after a little consideration . Greatly to the astonishment of the passengers in the street , as well as of her relations going on before , the good soul was obliged to stop and embrace me on the spot , with many protestations of her unalterable love . ‘
70047	70063	70042	70042	you	1874	’ she asked again , when this was over , and we were walking on . ‘
70078	70079	70065	70065	you	1874	’ ‘
70082	70086	70065	70065	you	1874	’ said Peggotty . ‘
70133	70134	70138	70139	the dear	1877	’ ‘
70141	70145	70138	70139	the dear	1877	’ cried Peggotty . ‘
70230	70236	70218	70218	I	0	’ said Peggotty , musing , ‘
70267	70279	70300	70300	Davy	232	’ We neither of us said anything for a little while . ‘
70292	70297	70281	70281	I	0	’ said Peggotty , cheerily ‘
70330	70331	70308	70308	I	0	’ ‘
70338	70342	70308	70308	I	0	’ I replied ; ‘
70359	70370	70308	70308	I	0	’ As indeed I did , with all my heart . ‘
70376	70385	70308	70308	I	0	’ said Peggotty , giving me a squeeze , ‘
70447	70451	70442	70445	a good plain creature	1889	’ said Peggotty , ‘
70481	70653	70475	70475	I	0	’ said Peggotty , laughing heartily . This quotation from Mr. Barkis was so appropriate , and tickled us both so much , that we laughed again and again , and were quite in a pleasant humour when we came within view of Mr. Peggotty ’s cottage . It looked just the same , except that it may , perhaps , have shrunk a little in my eyes ; and Mrs. Gummidge was waiting at the door as if she had stood there ever since . All within was the same , down to the seaweed in the blue mug in my bedroom . I went into the out - house to look about me ; and the very same lobsters , crabs , and crawfish possessed by the same desire to pinch the world in general , appeared to be in the same state of conglomeration in the same old corner . But there was no little Em’ly to be seen , so I asked Mr. Peggotty where she was . ‘
70661	70681	70654	70654	She	1890	’ said Mr. Peggotty , wiping the heat consequent on the porterage of Peggotty ’s box from his forehead ; ‘
70687	70694	70682	70682	she	1890	’ looking at the Dutch clock , ‘
70721	70726	70719	70719	ye	1894	’ Mrs. Gummidge moaned . ‘
70732	70737	70730	70730	Mawther	271	’ cried Mr. Peggotty . ‘
70746	70751	70752	70752	I	0	’ said Mrs. Gummidge ; ‘

70777	70820	70821	70824	The old ‘ un	8908	’ Mrs. Gummidge , whimpering and shaking her head , applied herself to blowing the fire . Mr. Peggotty , looking round upon us while she was so engaged , said in a low voice , which he shaded with his hand : ‘
70823	70826	70761	70761	she	1890	‘ un ! ’
71085	71095	71097	71098	little Em’ly	262	‘ Oh , it ’s you , is it ? ’
71100	71111	71113	71113	I.	0	‘ Why , you knew who it was , Em’ly , ’
71114	71124	71126	71126	Em’ly	262	‘ And did n’t YOU know who it was ? ’
71252	71260	71262	71263	Mr. Peggotty	234	‘ A little puss , it is ! ’
71272	71275	71268	71268	his	234	‘ So sh ’
71280	71283	71285	71285	Ham	236	’ is ! ’
71287	71291	71285	71285	Ham	236	‘ Mas’r Davy bor ’

71491	71494	71496	71497	Mr. Peggotty	234	‘ Ah ! ’
71513	71527	71529	71530	Mr. Peggotty	234	‘ here ’s another orphan , you see , sir . And here , ’

71570	71578	71567	71568	Mr. Peggotty	234	’ said I , shaking my head , ‘

71598	71600	71602	71602	Ham	236	’ ! ’
71608	71642	71602	71602	Ham	236	‘ Hoorah ! Well said ! Nor more you would n’t ! Hor ! Hor!’--Here he returned Mr. Peggotty ’s back - hander , and little Em’ly got up and kissed Mr. Peggotty . ‘
71651	71658	71649	71649	sir	979	’ said Mr. Peggotty to me . ‘
71661	71664	71659	71659	Steerforth	314	’ said I. ‘
71670	71679	71680	71680	I	0	’ cried Mr. Peggotty , turning to Ham . ‘

71697	71703	71691	71691	You	234	’ observed Ham , laughing . ‘
71706	71711	71695	71695	Rudderford	332	’ retorted Mr. Peggotty . ‘
71735	71736	71733	71733	sir	979	’ ‘
71750	71751	71747	71748	Mr. Peggotty	234	’ ‘
71757	71767	71754	71755	a friend	1563	’ said Mr. Peggotty , stretching out his pipe . ‘
71798	71799	71781	71781	Lord	1917	’ ‘
71809	71820	71821	71821	Handsome	333	’ said I , my heart warming with this praise . ‘
71823	71828	71829	71829	He	1910	’ cried Mr. Peggotty . ‘
71859	71860	71854	71854	He	1910	’ ‘
71869	71872	71866	71866	his	1910	’ said I. ‘

71903	71918	71897	71897	I	0	’ said Mr. Peggotty , looking at me through the smoke of his pipe , ‘
71937	71938	71927	71927	he	1910	’ ‘
71941	71947	71927	71927	he	1910	’ said I , delighted ; ‘
71957	71958	71952	71952	He	1910	’ ‘
71964	71977	71961	71962	a friend	1563	’ murmured Mr. Peggotty , with a grave toss of his head . ‘
71986	71989	71990	71990	He	1910	’ said I. ‘
72029	72044	72047	72047	he	1910	’ Mr. Peggotty gave his head another toss , as much as to say : ‘
72050	72051	72047	72047	he	1910	’ ‘
72058	72062	72055	72056	a speaker	1920	’ I pursued , ‘
72090	72105	72087	72088	Mr. Peggotty	234	’ Mr. Peggotty gave his head another toss , as much as to say : ‘
72113	72114	72087	72088	Mr. Peggotty	234	’ ‘
72128	72140	72120	72126	a generous , fine , noble fellow	1922	’ said I , quite carried away by my favourite theme , ‘
72186	72278	72279	72279	Em’ly	262	’ I was running on , very fast indeed , when my eyes rested on little Em’ly ’s face , which was bent forward over the table , listening with the deepest attention , her breath held , her blue eyes sparkling like jewels , and the colour mantling in her cheeks . She looked so extraordinarily earnest and pretty , that I stopped in a sort of wonder ; and they all observed her at the same time , for as I stopped , they laughed and looked at her . ‘
72284	72288	72279	72279	Em’ly	262	’ said Peggotty , ‘
72296	72893	72279	72279	Em’ly	262	’ Em’ly was confused by our all observing her , and hung down her head , and her face was covered with blushes . Glancing up presently through her stray curls , and seeing that we were all looking at her still ( I am sure I , for one , could have looked at her for hours ) , she ran away , and kept away till it was nearly bedtime . I lay down in the old little bed in the stern of the boat , and the wind came moaning on across the flat as it had done before . But I could not help fancying , now , that it moaned of those who were gone ; and instead of thinking that the sea might rise in the night and float the boat away , I thought of the sea that had risen , since I last heard those sounds , and drowned my happy home . I recollect , as the wind and water began to sound fainter in my ears , putting a short clause into my prayers , petitioning that I might grow up to marry little Em’ly , and so dropping lovingly asleep . The days passed pretty much as they had passed before , except -- it was a great exception -- that little Em’ly and I seldom wandered on the beach now . She had tasks to learn , and needle - work to do ; and was absent during a great part of each day . But I felt that we should not have had those old wanderings , even if it had been otherwise . Wild and full of childish whims as Em’ly was , she was more of a little woman than I had supposed . She seemed to have got a great distance away from me , in little more than a year . She liked me , but she laughed at me , and tormented me ; and when I went to meet her , stole home another way , and was laughing at the door when I came back , disappointed . The best times were when she sat quietly at work in the doorway , and I sat on the wooden step at her feet , reading to her . It seems to me , at this hour , that I have never seen such sunlight as on those bright April afternoons ; that I have never seen such a sunny little figure as I used to see , sitting in the doorway of the old boat ; that I have never beheld such sky , such water , such glorified ships sailing away into golden air . On the very first evening after our arrival , Mr. Barkis appeared in an exceedingly vacant and awkward condition , and with a bundle of oranges tied up in a handkerchief . As he made no allusion of any kind to this property , he was supposed to have left it behind him by accident when he went away ; until Ham , running after him to restore it , came back with the information that it was intended for Peggotty . After that occasion he appeared every evening at exactly the same hour , and always with a little bundle , to which he never alluded , and which he regularly put behind the door and left there . These offerings of affection were of a most various and eccentric description . Among them I remember a double set of pigs ’
73443	73457	73459	73460	Mrs. Gummidge	267	‘ No . It had better be done by somebody else , Dan’l , ’
73462	73464	73459	73460	Mrs. Gummidge	267	‘ I ’m
73469	73492	73501	73502	Mr. Peggotty	234	’ myself , and everythink that reminds me of creetur ’s that ai n’t lone and lorn , goes contrary with me . ’
73493	73499	73501	73502	Mr. Peggotty	234	‘ Come , old gal ! ’
73504	73510	73501	73502	Mr. Peggotty	234	‘ Take and heave it . ’
73511	73516	73518	73519	Mrs. Gummidge	267	‘ No , Dan’l , ’
73527	73567	73524	73524	her	267	‘ If I felt less , I could do more . You do n’t feel like me , Dan’l ; thinks do n’t go contrary with you , nor you with them ; you had better do it yourself . ’
73872	73876	73865	73868	the fairy little woman	1939	‘ a silly boy ’
73965	73978	73961	73961	he	1943	‘ What name was it as I wrote up in the cart ? ’
73979	73983	73984	73984	I	0	‘ Clara Peggotty , ’
73987	74007	73984	73984	I	0	‘ What name would it be as I should write up now , if there was a tilt here ? ’
74008	74014	74015	74015	I	0	‘ Clara Peggotty , again ? ’
74018	74023	74024	74024	he	1943	‘ Clara Peggotty BARKIS ! ’
74428	75187	74403	74403	he	1953	‘ a young Roeshus’--by which I think he meant prodigy . When we had exhausted the subject of the stars , or rather when I had exhausted the mental faculties of Mr. Barkis , little Em’ly and I made a cloak of an old wrapper , and sat under it for the rest of the journey . Ah , how I loved her ! What happiness ( I thought ) if we were married , and were going away anywhere to live among the trees and in the fields , never growing older , never growing wiser , children ever , rambling hand in hand through sunshine and among flowery meadows , laying down our heads on moss at night , in a sweet sleep of purity and peace , and buried by the birds when we were dead ! Some such picture , with no real world in it , bright with the light of our innocence , and vague as the stars afar off , was in my mind all the way . I am glad to think there were two such guileless hearts at Peggotty ’s marriage as little Em’ly ’s and mine . I am glad to think the Loves and Graces took such airy forms in its homely procession . Well , we came to the old boat again in good time at night ; and there Mr. and Mrs. Barkis bade us good - bye , and drove away snugly to their own home . I felt then , for the first time , that I had lost Peggotty . I should have gone to bed with a sore heart indeed under any other roof but that which sheltered little Em’ly ’s head . Mr. Peggotty and Ham knew what was in my thoughts as well as I did , and were ready with some supper and their hospitable faces to drive it away . Little Em’ly came and sat beside me on the locker for the only time in all that visit ; and it was altogether a wonderful close to a wonderful day . It was a night tide ; and soon after we went to bed , Mr. Peggotty and Ham went out to fish . I felt very brave at being left alone in the solitary house , the protector of Em’ly and Mrs. Gummidge , and only wished that a lion or a serpent , or any ill - disposed monster , would make an attack upon us , that I might destroy him , and cover myself with glory . But as nothing of the sort happened to be walking about on Yarmouth flats that night , I provided the best substitute I could by dreaming of dragons until morning . With morning came Peggotty ; who called to me , as usual , under my window as if Mr. Barkis the carrier had been from first to last a dream too . After breakfast she took me to her own home , and a beautiful little home it was . Of all the moveables in it , I must have been impressed by a certain old bureau of some dark wood in the parlour ( the tile - floored kitchen was the general sitting - room ) , with a retreating top which opened , let down , and became a desk , within which was a large quarto edition of Foxe ’s Book of Martyrs . This precious volume , of which I do not recollect one word , I immediately discovered and immediately applied myself to ; and I never visited the house afterwards , but I kneeled on a chair , opened the casket where this gem was enshrined , spread my arms over the desk , and fell to devouring the book afresh . I was chiefly edified , I am afraid , by the pictures , which were numerous , and represented all kinds of dismal horrors ; but the Martyrs and Peggotty ’s house have been inseparable in my mind ever since , and are now . I took leave of Mr. Peggotty , and Ham , and Mrs. Gummidge , and little Em’ly , that day ; and passed the night at Peggotty ’s , in a little room in the roof ( with the Crocodile Book on a shelf by the bed ’s head ) which was to be always mine , Peggotty said , and should always be kept for me in exactly the same state . ‘
75209	75213	75214	75214	you	1874	’ said Peggotty , ‘
75275	75985	76252	76252	Brooks	251	’ I felt the truth and constancy of my dear old nurse , with all my heart , and thanked her as well as I could . That was not very well , for she spoke to me thus , with her arms round my neck , in the morning , and I was going home in the morning , and I went home in the morning , with herself and Mr. Barkis in the cart . They left me at the gate , not easily or lightly ; and it was a strange sight to me to see the cart go on , taking Peggotty away , and leaving me under the old elm - trees looking at the house , in which there was no face to look on mine with love or liking any more . And now I fell into a state of neglect , which I can not look back upon without compassion . I fell at once into a solitary condition,--apart from all friendly notice , apart from the society of all other boys of my own age , apart from all companionship but my own spiritless thoughts,--which seems to cast its gloom upon this paper as I write . What would I have given , to have been sent to the hardest school that ever was kept!--to have been taught something , anyhow , anywhere ! No such hope dawned upon me . They disliked me ; and they sullenly , sternly , steadily , overlooked me . I think Mr. Murdstone ’s means were straitened at about this time ; but it is little to the purpose . He could not bear me ; and in putting me from him he tried , as I believe , to put away the notion that I had any claim upon him -- and succeeded . I was not actively ill - used . I was not beaten , or starved ; but the wrong that was done to me had no intervals of relenting , and was done in a systematic , passionless manner . Day after day , week after week , month after month , I was coldly neglected . I wonder sometimes , when I think of it , what they would have done if I had been taken with an illness ; whether I should have lain down in my lonely room , and languished through it in my usual solitary way , or whether anybody would have helped me out . When Mr. and Miss Murdstone were at home , I took my meals with them ; in their absence , I ate and drank by myself . At all times I lounged about the house and neighbourhood quite disregarded , except that they were jealous of my making any friends : thinking , perhaps , that if I did , I might complain to someone . For this reason , though Mr. Chillip often asked me to go and see him ( he was a widower , having , some years before that , lost a little small light - haired wife , whom I can just remember connecting in my own thoughts with a pale tortoise - shell cat ) , it was but seldom that I enjoyed the happiness of passing an afternoon in his closet of a surgery ; reading some book that was new to me , with the smell of the whole Pharmacopoeia coming up my nose , or pounding something in a mortar under his mild directions . For the same reason , added no doubt to the old dislike of her , I was seldom allowed to visit Peggotty . Faithful to her promise , she either came to see me , or met me somewhere near , once every week , and never empty - handed ; but many and bitter were the disappointments I had , in being refused permission to pay a visit to her at her house . Some few times , however , at long intervals , I was allowed to go there ; and then I found out that Mr. Barkis was something of a miser , or as Peggotty dutifully expressed it , was ‘
75989	76249	76252	76252	Brooks	251	’ , and kept a heap of money in a box under his bed , which he pretended was only full of coats and trousers . In this coffer , his riches hid themselves with such a tenacious modesty , that the smallest instalments could only be tempted out by artifice ; so that Peggotty had to prepare a long and elaborate scheme , a very Gunpowder Plot , for every Saturday ’s expenses . All this time I was so conscious of the waste of any promise I had given , and of my being utterly neglected , that I should have been perfectly miserable , I have no doubt , but for the old books . They were my only comfort ; and I was as true to them as they were to me , and read them over and over I do n’t know how many times more . I now approach a period of my life , which I can never lose the remembrance of , while I remember anything : and the recollection of which has often , without my invocation , come before me like a ghost , and haunted happier times . I had been out , one day , loitering somewhere , in the listless , meditative manner that my way of life engendered , when , turning the corner of a lane near our house , I came upon Mr. Murdstone walking with a gentleman . I was confused , and was going by them , when the gentleman cried : ‘
76254	76255	76252	76252	Brooks	251	’ ‘
76263	76267	76260	76261	David Copperfield	232	’ I said . ‘
76277	76282	76273	76273	You	251	’ said the gentleman . ‘
76294	76348	76291	76291	your	251	’ At these words , I observed the gentleman more attentively . His laugh coming to my remembrance too , I knew him to be Mr. Quinion , whom I had gone over to Lowestoft with Mr. Murdstone to see , before -- it is no matter -- I need not recall when . ‘
76365	76404	76363	76363	Brooks	251	’ said Mr. Quinion . He had put his hand upon my shoulder , and turned me about , to walk with them . I did not know what to reply , and glanced dubiously at Mr. Murdstone . ‘
76412	76417	76405	76405	He	1965	’ said the latter . ‘
76441	76473	76435	76435	He	1965	’ That old , double look was on me for a moment ; and then his eyes darkened with a frown , as it turned , in its aversion , elsewhere . ‘
76476	76489	76435	76435	He	1965	’ said Mr. Quinion , looking at us both , I thought . ‘
76493	76520	76435	76435	He	1965	’ Silence ensued , and I was considering how I could best disengage my shoulder from his hand , and go away , when he said : ‘
76535	76536	76533	76533	Brooks	251	’ ‘
76544	76551	76539	76539	He	1965	’ said Mr. Murdstone , impatiently . ‘
76568	76713	76714	76714	David	232	’ On this hint , Mr. Quinion released me , and I made the best of my way home . Looking back as I turned into the front garden , I saw Mr. Murdstone leaning against the wicket of the churchyard , and Mr. Quinion talking to him . They were both looking after me , and I felt that they were speaking of me . Mr. Quinion lay at our house that night . After breakfast , the next morning , I had put my chair away , and was going out of the room , when Mr. Murdstone called me back . He then gravely repaired to another table , where his sister sat herself at her desk . Mr. Quinion , with his hands in his pockets , stood looking out of window ; and I stood looking at them all . ‘
76716	76721	76714	76714	David	232	’ said Mr. Murdstone , ‘
76739	76744	76746	76747	his sister	8825	’ --‘As you do , ’
76749	76836	76746	76747	his sister	8825	‘ Jane Murdstone , leave it to me , if you please . I say , David , to the young this is a world for action , and not for moping and droning in . It is especially so for a young boy of your disposition , which requires a great deal of correcting ; and to which no greater service can be done than to force it to conform to the ways of the working world , and to bend it and break it . ’
76837	76845	76847	76848	his sister	8825	‘ For stubbornness wo n’t do here , ’
76849	76870	76871	76871	He	232	‘ What it wants is , to be crushed . And crushed it must be . Shall be , too ! ’
76889	76979	76871	76871	He	232	‘ I suppose you know , David , that I am not rich . At any rate , you know it now . You have received some considerable education already . Education is costly ; and even if it were not , and I could afford it , I am of opinion that it would not be at all advantageous to you to be kept at school . What is before you , is a fight with the world ; and the sooner you begin it , the better . ’
77009	77022	77024	77025	Mr. Murdstone	247	‘ You have heard the “ counting - house ” mentioned sometimes , ’
77027	77035	77036	77036	I	0	‘ The counting - house , sir ? ’
77039	77050	77051	77051	he	247	‘ Of Murdstone and Grinby , in the wine trade , ’
77066	77095	77061	77061	he	247	‘ You have heard the “ counting - house ” mentioned , or the business , or the cellars , or the wharf , or something about it . ’
77096	77108	77109	77109	I	0	‘ I think I have heard the business mentioned , sir , ’
77125	77133	77109	77109	I	0	‘ But I do n’t know when . ’
77134	77141	77142	77142	he	247	‘ It does not matter when , ’
77145	77152	77142	77142	he	247	‘ Mr. Quinion manages that business . ’
77167	77201	77153	77153	I	0	‘ Mr. Quinion suggests that it gives employment to some other boys , and that he sees no reason why it should n’t , on the same terms , give employment to you . ’
77202	77206	77207	77208	Mr. Quinion	250	‘ He having , ’
77220	77227	77207	77208	Mr. Quinion	250	‘ no other prospect , Murdstone . ’
77249	77293	77245	77245	he	247	‘ Those terms are , that you will earn enough for yourself to provide for your eating and drinking , and pocket - money . Your lodging ( which I have arranged for ) will be paid by me . So will your washing-- ’
77294	77304	77306	77307	his sister	8825	‘ --Which will be kept down to my estimate , ’
77309	77321	77323	77324	Mr. Murdstone	247	‘ Your clothes will be looked after for you , too , ’
77326	77366	77323	77324	Mr. Murdstone	247	‘ as you will not be able , yet awhile , to get them for yourself . So you are now going to London , David , with Mr. Quinion , to begin the world on your own account . ’
77367	77376	77378	77379	his sister	8825	‘ In short , you are provided for , ’
77381	77390	77378	77379	his sister	8825	‘ and will please to do your duty . ’
78737	78740	78742	78743	Mr. Quinion	250	‘ This , ’
78750	78754	78742	78743	Mr. Quinion	250	‘ is he . ’
78755	78758	78760	78761	the stranger	2041	‘ This , ’
78788	78802	78803	78803	I	0	‘ is Master Copperfield . I hope I see you well , sir ? ’

I have received a letter from Mr. Murdstone , in which he mentions that he would desire me to receive into an apartment in the rear of my house , which is at present unoccupied -- and is , in short , to be let as a -- in short , ’
78937	78952	78954	78955	the stranger	2041	‘ as a bedroom -- the young beginner whom I have now the pleasure to-- ’

78983	78986	78988	78989	the stranger	2041	‘ Ahem ! ’
78991	78997	78988	78989	the stranger	2041	‘ that is my name . ’
78998	79002	79004	79005	Mr. Quinion	250	‘ Mr. Micawber , ’
79007	79053	79004	79005	Mr. Quinion	250	‘ is known to Mr. Murdstone . He takes orders for us on commission , when he can get any . He has been written to by Mr. Murdstone , on the subject of your lodgings , and he will receive you as a lodger . ’
79054	79058	79060	79061	Mr. Micawber	341	‘ My address , ’
79063	79076	79078	79079	Mr. Micawber	341	‘ is Windsor Terrace , City Road . I -- in short , ’
79096	79103	79004	79005	Mr. Quinion	250	’ I made him a bow . ‘
79108	79113	79004	79005	Mr. Quinion	250	’ said Mr. Micawber , ‘
79151	79162	79169	79169	I	0	’ said Mr. Micawber , in another burst of confidence , ‘
79189	79211	79169	79169	I	0	’ I thanked him with all my heart , for it was friendly in him to offer to take that trouble . ‘
79216	79221	79223	79223	I--	0	’ said Mr. Micawber , ‘
79224	79225	79223	79223	I--	0	’ ‘
79230	79235	79223	79223	I--	0	’ said Mr. Quinion . ‘
79240	79245	79223	79223	I--	0	’ said Mr. Micawber . ‘
79263	79719	79257	79257	I	0	’ So he put on his hat , and went out with his cane under his arm : very upright , and humming a tune when he was clear of the counting - house . Mr. Quinion then formally engaged me to be as useful as I could in the warehouse of Murdstone and Grinby , at a salary , I think , of six shillings a week . I am not clear whether it was six or seven . I am inclined to believe , from my uncertainty on this head , that it was six at first and seven afterwards . He paid me a week down ( from his own pocket , I believe ) , and I gave Mealy sixpence out of it to get my trunk carried to Windsor Terrace that night : it being too heavy for my strength , small as it was . I paid sixpence more for my dinner , which was a meat pie and a turn at a neighbouring pump ; and passed the hour which was allowed for that meal , in walking about the streets . At the appointed time in the evening , Mr. Micawber reappeared . I washed my hands and face , to do the greater honour to his gentility , and we walked to our house , as I suppose I must now call it , together ; Mr. Micawber impressing the name of streets , and the shapes of corner houses upon me , as we went along , that I might find my way back , easily , in the morning . Arrived at this house in Windsor Terrace ( which I noticed was shabby like himself , but also , like himself , made all the show it could ) , he presented me to Mrs. Micawber , a thin and faded lady , not at all young , who was sitting in the parlour ( the first floor was altogether unfurnished , and the blinds were kept down to delude the neighbours ) , with a baby at her breast . This baby was one of twins ; and I may remark here that I hardly ever , in all my experience of the family , saw both the twins detached from Mrs. Micawber at the same time . One of them was always taking refreshment . There were two other children ; Master Micawber , aged about four , and Miss Micawber , aged about three . These , and a dark - complexioned young woman , with a habit of snorting , who was servant to the family , and informed me , before half an hour had expired , that she was ‘
79722	79779	79780	79780	I	0	’ , and came from St. Luke ’s workhouse , in the neighbourhood , completed the establishment . My room was at the top of the house , at the back : a close chamber ; stencilled all over with an ornament which my young imagination represented as a blue muffin ; and very scantily furnished . ‘
79784	79811	79780	79780	I	0	’ said Mrs. Micawber , when she came up , twin and all , to show me the apartment , and sat down to take breath , ‘
79853	79857	79838	79839	Mr. Micawber	341	’ I said : ‘
79862	79863	79838	79839	Mr. Micawber	341	’ ‘
79875	79880	79860	79860	ma’am	8495	’ said Mrs. Micawber ; ‘
79937	80017	79932	79932	papa	2049	’ I can not satisfy myself whether she told me that Mr. Micawber had been an officer in the Marines , or whether I have imagined it . I only know that I believe to this hour that he WAS in the Marines once upon a time , without knowing why . He was a sort of town traveller for a number of miscellaneous houses , now ; but made little or nothing of it , I am afraid . ‘
80029	80034	79932	79932	papa	2049	’ said Mrs. Micawber , ‘
80082	80199	80079	80080	Mr. Micawber	341	’ I never can quite understand whether my precocious self - dependence confused Mrs. Micawber in reference to my age , or whether she was so full of the subject that she would have talked about it to the very twins if there had been nobody else to communicate with , but this was the strain in which she began , and she went on accordingly all the time I knew her . Poor Mrs. Micawber ! She said she had tried to exert herself , and so , I have no doubt , she had . The centre of the street door was perfectly covered with a great brass - plate , on which was engraved ‘
80208	80374	80079	80080	Mr. Micawber	341	’ : but I never found that any young lady had ever been to school there ; or that any young lady ever came , or proposed to come ; or that the least preparation was ever made to receive any young lady . The only visitors I ever saw , or heard of , were creditors . THEY used to come at all hours , and some of them were quite ferocious . One dirty - faced man , I think he was a boot - maker , used to edge himself into the passage as early as seven o’clock in the morning , and call up the stairs to Mr. Micawber--‘Come ! You ai n’t out yet , you know . Pay us , will you ? Do n’t hide , you know ; that ’s mean . I would n’t be mean if I was you . Pay us , will you ? You just pay us , d’ye hear ? Come ! ’
80391	80393	80382	80382	he	2060	‘ swindlers ’
80395	80397	80382	80382	he	2060	‘ robbers ’
80871	81168	81479	81479	your	2077	’ doors , and spent in that the money I should have kept for my dinner . Then , I went without my dinner , or bought a roll or a slice of pudding . I remember two pudding shops , between which I was divided , according to my finances . One was in a court close to St. Martin ’s Church -- at the back of the church,--which is now removed altogether . The pudding at that shop was made of currants , and was rather a special pudding , but was dear , twopennyworth not being larger than a pennyworth of more ordinary pudding . A good shop for the latter was in the Strand -- somewhere in that part which has been rebuilt since . It was a stout pale pudding , heavy and flabby , and with great flat raisins in it , stuck in whole at wide distances apart . It came up hot at about my time every day , and many a day did I dine off it . When I dined regularly and handsomely , I had a saveloy and a penny loaf , or a fourpenny plate of red beef from a cook ’s shop ; or a plate of bread and cheese and a glass of beer , from a miserable old public - house opposite our place of business , called the Lion , or the Lion and something else that I have forgotten . Once , I remember carrying my own bread ( which I had brought from home in the morning ) under my arm , wrapped in a piece of paper , like a book , and going to a famous alamode beef - house near Drury Lane , and ordering a ‘
81171	81473	81479	81479	your	2077	’ of that delicacy to eat with it . What the waiter thought of such a strange little apparition coming in all alone , I do n’t know ; but I can see him now , staring at me as I ate my dinner , and bringing up the other waiter to look . I gave him a halfpenny for himself , and I wish he had n’t taken it . We had half - an - hour , I think , for tea . When I had money enough , I used to get half - a - pint of ready - made coffee and a slice of bread and butter . When I had none , I used to look at a venison shop in Fleet Street ; or I have strolled , at such a time , as far as Covent Garden Market , and stared at the pineapples . I was fond of wandering about the Adelphi , because it was a mysterious place , with those dark arches . I see myself emerging one evening from some of these arches , on a little public - house close to the river , with an open space before it , where some coal - heavers were dancing ; to look at whom I sat down upon a bench . I wonder what they thought of me ! I was such a child , and so little , that frequently when I went into the bar of a strange public - house for a glass of ale or porter , to moisten what I had had for dinner , they were afraid to give it me . I remember one hot evening I went into the bar of a public - house , and said to the landlord : ‘
81487	81508	81479	81479	your	2077	’ For it was a special occasion . I do n’t know what . It may have been my birthday . ‘
81513	81518	81479	81479	your	2077	’ says the landlord , ‘
81528	81529	81479	81479	your	2077	’ ‘
81532	81540	81479	81479	your	2077	’ says I , producing the money , ‘
81562	82131	82132	82135	the little gent ’	10061	’ The landlord looked at me in return over the bar , from head to foot , with a strange smile on his face ; and instead of drawing the beer , looked round the screen and said something to his wife . She came out from behind it , with her work in her hand , and joined him in surveying me . Here we stand , all three , before me now . The landlord in his shirt - sleeves , leaning against the bar window - frame ; his wife looking over the little half - door ; and I , in some confusion , looking up at them from outside the partition . They asked me a good many questions ; as , what my name was , how old I was , where I lived , how I was employed , and how I came there . To all of which , that I might commit nobody , I invented , I am afraid , appropriate answers . They served me with the ale , though I suspect it was not the Genuine Stunning ; and the landlord ’s wife , opening the little half - door of the bar , and bending down , gave me my money back , and gave me a kiss that was half admiring and half compassionate , but all womanly and good , I am sure . I know I do not exaggerate , unconsciously and unintentionally , the scantiness of my resources or the difficulties of my life . I know that if a shilling were given me by Mr. Quinion at any time , I spent it in a dinner or a tea . I know that I worked , from morning until night , with common men and boys , a shabby child . I know that I lounged about the streets , insufficiently and unsatisfactorily fed . I know that , but for the mercy of God , I might easily have been , for any care that was taken of me , a little robber or a little vagabond . Yet I held some station at Murdstone and Grinby ’s too . Besides that Mr. Quinion did what a careless man so occupied , and dealing with a thing so anomalous , could , to treat me as one upon a different footing from the rest , I never said , to man or boy , how it was that I came to be there , or gave the least indication of being sorry that I was there . That I suffered in secret , and that I suffered exquisitely , no one ever knew but I. How much I suffered , it is , as I have said already , utterly beyond my power to tell . But I kept my own counsel , and I did my work . I knew from the first , that , if I could not do my work as well as any of the rest , I could not hold myself above slight and contempt . I soon became at least as expeditious and as skilful as either of the other boys . Though perfectly familiar with them , my conduct and manner were different enough from theirs to place a space between us . They and the men generally spoke of me as ‘
82135	82138	82139	82141	the young Suffolker	2078	’ , or ‘
82143	82179	82180	82180	David	232	’ A certain man named Gregory , who was foreman of the packers , and another named Tipp , who was the carman , and wore a red jacket , used to address me sometimes as ‘
82181	82564	82132	82135	the little gent ’	10061	’ : but I think it was mostly when we were very confidential , and when I had made some efforts to entertain them , over our work , with some results of the old readings ; which were fast perishing out of my remembrance . Mealy Potatoes uprose once , and rebelled against my being so distinguished ; but Mick Walker settled him in no time . My rescue from this kind of existence I considered quite hopeless , and abandoned , as such , altogether . I am solemnly convinced that I never for one hour was reconciled to it , or was otherwise than miserably unhappy ; but I bore it ; and even to Peggotty , partly for the love of her and partly for shame , never in any letter ( though many passed between us ) revealed the truth . Mr. Micawber ’s difficulties were an addition to the distressed state of my mind . In my forlorn state I became quite attached to the family , and used to walk about , busy with Mrs. Micawber ’s calculations of ways and means , and heavy with the weight of Mr. Micawber ’s debts . On a Saturday night , which was my grand treat,--partly because it was a great thing to walk home with six or seven shillings in my pocket , looking into the shops and thinking what such a sum would buy , and partly because I went home early,--Mrs . Micawber would make the most heart - rending confidences to me ; also on a Sunday morning , when I mixed the portion of tea or coffee I had bought over - night , in a little shaving - pot , and sat late at my breakfast . It was nothing at all unusual for Mr. Micawber to sob violently at the beginning of one of these Saturday night conversations , and sing about Jack ’s delight being his lovely Nan , towards the end of it . I have known him come home to supper with a flood of tears , and a declaration that nothing was now left but a jail ; and go to bed making a calculation of the expense of putting bow - windows to the house , ‘
82570	82682	82180	82180	David	232	’ , which was his favourite expression . And Mrs. Micawber was just the same . A curious equality of friendship , originating , I suppose , in our respective circumstances , sprung up between me and these people , notwithstanding the ludicrous disparity in our years . But I never allowed myself to be prevailed upon to accept any invitation to eat and drink with them out of their stock ( knowing that they got on badly with the butcher and baker , and had often not too much for themselves ) , until Mrs. Micawber took me into her entire confidence . This she did one evening as follows : ‘
82686	82691	82683	82684	Master Copperfield	232	’ said Mrs. Micawber , ‘
82717	82741	82707	82708	Mr. Micawber	341	’ It made me very miserable to hear it , and I looked at Mrs. Micawber ’s red eyes with the utmost sympathy . ‘
82767	82821	82764	82765	Mrs. Micawber	342	‘ there is really not a scrap of anything in the larder . I was accustomed to speak of the larder when I lived with papa and mama , and I use the word almost unconsciously . What I mean to express is , that there is nothing to eat in the house . ’
82822	82826	82827	82827	I	0	‘ Dear me ! ’
82915	82923	82925	82925	she	784	‘ No , my dear Master Copperfield , ’
82927	82966	82925	82925	she	784	‘ far be it from my thoughts ! But you have a discretion beyond your years , and can render me another kind of service , if you will ; and a service I will thankfully accept of . ’
82975	82984	82986	82987	Mrs. Micawber	342	‘ I have parted with the plate myself , ’
82989	83105	82986	82987	Mrs. Micawber	342	‘ Six tea , two salt , and a pair of sugars , I have at different times borrowed money on , in secret , with my own hands . But the twins are a great tie ; and to me , with my recollections , of papa and mama , these transactions are very painful . There are still a few trifles that we could part with . Mr. Micawber ’s feelings would never allow him to dispose of them ; and Clickett’--this was the girl from the workhouse--‘being of a vulgar mind , would take painful liberties if so much confidence was reposed in her . Master Copperfield , if I might ask you-- ’
83714	83931	83932	83933	Captain Hopkins	350	’ prison , there was a man there with nothing on him but an old rug , the turnkey swam before my dimmed eyes and my beating heart . Mr. Micawber was waiting for me within the gate , and we went up to his room ( top story but one ) , and cried very much . He solemnly conjured me , I remember , to take warning by his fate ; and to observe that if a man had twenty pounds a - year for his income , and spent nineteen pounds nineteen shillings and sixpence , he would be happy , but that if he spent twenty pounds one he would be miserable . After which he borrowed a shilling of me for porter , gave me a written order on Mrs. Micawber for the amount , and put away his pocket - handkerchief , and cheered up . We sat before a little fire , with two bricks put within the rusted grate , one on each side , to prevent its burning too many coals ; until another debtor , who shared the room with Mr. Micawber , came in from the bakehouse with the loin of mutton which was our joint - stock repast . Then I was sent up to ‘
83934	84924	83932	83933	Captain Hopkins	350	’ in the room overhead , with Mr. Micawber ’s compliments , and I was his young friend , and would Captain Hopkins lend me a knife and fork . Captain Hopkins lent me the knife and fork , with his compliments to Mr. Micawber . There was a very dirty lady in his little room , and two wan girls , his daughters , with shock heads of hair . I thought it was better to borrow Captain Hopkins ’s knife and fork , than Captain Hopkins ’s comb . The Captain himself was in the last extremity of shabbiness , with large whiskers , and an old , old brown great - coat with no other coat below it . I saw his bed rolled up in a corner ; and what plates and dishes and pots he had , on a shelf ; and I divined ( God knows how ) that though the two girls with the shock heads of hair were Captain Hopkins ’s children , the dirty lady was not married to Captain Hopkins . My timid station on his threshold was not occupied more than a couple of minutes at most ; but I came down again with all this in my knowledge , as surely as the knife and fork were in my hand . There was something gipsy - like and agreeable in the dinner , after all . I took back Captain Hopkins ’s knife and fork early in the afternoon , and went home to comfort Mrs. Micawber with an account of my visit . She fainted when she saw me return , and made a little jug of egg - hot afterwards to console us while we talked it over . I do n’t know how the household furniture came to be sold for the family benefit , or who sold it , except that I did not . Sold it was , however , and carried away in a van ; except the bed , a few chairs , and the kitchen table . With these possessions we encamped , as it were , in the two parlours of the emptied house in Windsor Terrace ; Mrs. Micawber , the children , the Orfling , and myself ; and lived in those rooms night and day . I have no idea for how long , though it seems to me for a long time . At last Mrs. Micawber resolved to move into the prison , where Mr. Micawber had now secured a room to himself . So I took the key of the house to the landlord , who was very glad to get it ; and the beds were sent over to the King ’s Bench , except mine , for which a little room was hired outside the walls in the neighbourhood of that Institution , very much to my satisfaction , since the Micawbers and I had become too used to one another , in our troubles , to part . The Orfling was likewise accommodated with an inexpensive lodging in the same neighbourhood . Mine was a quiet back - garret with a sloping roof , commanding a pleasant prospect of a timberyard ; and when I took possession of it , with the reflection that Mr. Micawber ’s troubles had come to a crisis at last , I thought it quite a paradise . All this time I was working at Murdstone and Grinby ’s in the same common way , and with the same common companions , and with the same sense of unmerited degradation as at first . But I never , happily for me no doubt , made a single acquaintance , or spoke to any of the many boys whom I saw daily in going to the warehouse , in coming from it , and in prowling about the streets at meal - times . I led the same secretly unhappy life ; but I led it in the same lonely , self - reliant manner . The only changes I am conscious of are , firstly , that I had grown more shabby , and secondly , that I was now relieved of much of the weight of Mr. and Mrs. Micawber ’s cares ; for some relatives or friends had engaged to help them at their present pass , and they lived more comfortably in the prison than they had lived for a long while out of it . I used to breakfast with them now , in virtue of some arrangement , of which I have forgotten the details . I forget , too , at what hour the gates were opened in the morning , admitting of my going in ; but I know that I was often up at six o’clock , and that my favourite lounging - place in the interval was old London Bridge , where I was wo nt to sit in one of the stone recesses , watching the people going by , or to look over the balustrades at the sun shining in the water , and lighting up the golden flame on the top of the Monument . The Orfling met me here sometimes , to be told some astonishing fictions respecting the wharves and the Tower ; of which I can say no more than that I hope I believed them myself . In the evening I used to go back to the prison , and walk up and down the parade with Mr. Micawber ; or play casino with Mrs. Micawber , and hear reminiscences of her papa and mama . Whether Mr. Murdstone knew where I was , I am unable to say . I never told them at Murdstone and Grinby ’s . Mr. Micawber ’s affairs , although past their crisis , were very much involved by reason of a certain ‘
84926	85034	83932	83933	Captain Hopkins	350	’ , of which I used to hear a great deal , and which I suppose , now , to have been some former composition with his creditors , though I was so far from being clear about it then , that I am conscious of having confounded it with those demoniacal parchments which are held to have , once upon a time , obtained to a great extent in Germany . At last this document appeared to be got out of the way , somehow ; at all events it ceased to be the rock - ahead it had been ; and Mrs. Micawber informed me that ‘
85037	85068	83932	83933	Captain Hopkins	350	’ had decided that Mr. Micawber should apply for his release under the Insolvent Debtors Act , which would set him free , she expected , in about six weeks . ‘
85072	85081	83932	83933	Captain Hopkins	350	’ said Mr. Micawber , who was present , ‘
85119	85567	85569	85569	you	2116	’ By way of going in for anything that might be on the cards , I call to mind that Mr. Micawber , about this time , composed a petition to the House of Commons , praying for an alteration in the law of imprisonment for debt . I set down this remembrance here , because it is an instance to myself of the manner in which I fitted my old books to my altered life , and made stories for myself , out of the streets , and out of men and women ; and how some main points in the character I shall unconsciously develop , I suppose , in writing my life , were gradually forming all this while . There was a club in the prison , in which Mr. Micawber , as a gentleman , was a great authority . Mr. Micawber had stated his idea of this petition to the club , and the club had strongly approved of the same . Wherefore Mr. Micawber ( who was a thoroughly good - natured man , and as active a creature about everything but his own affairs as ever existed , and never so happy as when he was busy about something that could never be of any profit to him ) set to work at the petition , invented it , engrossed it on an immense sheet of paper , spread it out on a table , and appointed a time for all the club , and all within the walls if they chose , to come up to his room and sign it . When I heard of this approaching ceremony , I was so anxious to see them all come in , one after another , though I knew the greater part of them already , and they me , that I got an hour ’s leave of absence from Murdstone and Grinby ’s , and established myself in a corner for that purpose . As many of the principal members of the club as could be got into the small room without filling it , supported Mr. Micawber in front of the petition , while my old friend Captain Hopkins ( who had washed himself , to do honour to so solemn an occasion ) stationed himself close to it , to read it to all who were unacquainted with its contents . The door was then thrown open , and the general population began to come in , in a long file : several waiting outside , while one entered , affixed his signature , and went out . To everybody in succession , Captain Hopkins said : ‘
85573	85581	85569	85569	you	2116	’---‘Would you like to hear it read ? ’
85644	85653	85638	85638	he	2116	‘ The people ’s representatives in Parliament assembled , ’
85654	85664	85638	85638	he	2116	‘ Your petitioners therefore humbly approach your honourable house , ’
85665	85673	85638	85638	he	2116	‘ His gracious Majesty ’s unfortunate subjects , ’
86047	86060	86062	86063	Mrs. Micawber	342	‘ On such an occasion I will give you , Master Copperfield , ’
86065	86072	86062	86063	Mrs. Micawber	342	‘ in a little more flip , ’
86081	86090	86062	86063	Mrs. Micawber	342	‘ the memory of my papa and mama . ’
86091	86098	86099	86099	I	0	‘ Are they dead , ma’am ? ’
86112	86119	86121	86122	Mrs. Micawber	342	‘ My mama departed this life , ’
86124	86160	86121	86122	Mrs. Micawber	342	‘ before Mr. Micawber ’s difficulties commenced , or at least before they became pressing . My papa lived to bail Mr. Micawber several times , and then expired , regretted by a numerous circle . ’
86210	86245	86204	86204	I	0	‘ May I ask , ma’am , what you and Mr. Micawber intend to do , now that Mr. Micawber is out of his difficulties , and at liberty ? Have you settled yet ? ’
86246	86250	86252	86253	Mrs. Micawber	342	‘ My family , ’
86276	86309	86310	86310	I	0	‘ my family are of opinion that Mr. Micawber should quit London , and exert his talents in the country . Mr. Micawber is a man of great talent , Master Copperfield . ’
86318	86323	86325	86326	Mrs. Micawber	342	‘ Of great talent , ’
86328	86390	86325	86326	Mrs. Micawber	342	‘ My family are of opinion , that , with a little interest , something might be done for a man of his ability in the Custom House . The influence of my family being local , it is their wish that Mr. Micawber should go down to Plymouth . They think it indispensable that he should be upon the spot . ’
86391	86398	86399	86399	I	0	‘ That he may be ready ? ’
86402	86405	86407	86408	Mrs. Micawber	342	‘ Exactly , ’
86410	86424	86407	86408	Mrs. Micawber	342	‘ That he may be ready -- in case of anything turning up . ’
86425	86434	86325	86326	Mrs. Micawber	342	‘ And do you go too , ma’am ? ’
86467	86560	86460	86460	she	342	‘ I never will desert Mr. Micawber . Mr. Micawber may have concealed his difficulties from me in the first instance , but his sanguine temper may have led him to expect that he would overcome them . The pearl necklace and bracelets which I inherited from mama , have been disposed of for less than half their value ; and the set of coral , which was the wedding gift of my papa , has been actually thrown away for nothing . But I never will desert Mr. Micawber . No ! ’
86570	86585	86562	86563	Mrs. Micawber	342	‘ I never will do it ! It ’s of no use asking me ! ’
86613	86650	86651	86651	she	342	‘ Mr. Micawber has his faults . I do not deny that he is improvident . I do not deny that he has kept me in the dark as to his resources and his liabilities both , ’
86660	86669	86651	86651	she	342	‘ but I never will desert Mr. Micawber ! ’
86785	86791	86793	86794	Mr. Micawber	341	‘ Emma , my angel ! ’
86801	86807	86793	86794	Mr. Micawber	341	‘ what is the matter ? ’
86808	86817	86818	86818	she	342	‘ I never will desert you , Micawber ! ’

86845	86870	86872	86873	Mrs. Micawber	342	‘ He is the parent of my children ! He is the father of my twins ! He is the husband of my affections , ’
86877	86890	86872	86873	Mrs. Micawber	342	‘ and I ne -- ver -- will -- desert Mr. Micawber ! ’
87036	87060	87034	87035	the strangers	2135	’ bell should ring . So I sat at the staircase window , until he came out with another chair and joined me . ‘
87069	87073	87063	87064	Mrs. Micawber	342	’ I said . ‘
87077	87086	87063	87064	Mrs. Micawber	342	’ said Mr. Micawber , shaking his head ; ‘
87109	87870	87871	87871	I	0	’ Mr. Micawber pressed my hand , and groaned , and afterwards shed tears . I was greatly touched , and disappointed too , for I had expected that we should be quite gay on this happy and long - looked - for occasion . But Mr. and Mrs. Micawber were so used to their old difficulties , I think , that they felt quite shipwrecked when they came to consider that they were released from them . All their elasticity was departed , and I never saw them half so wretched as on this night ; insomuch that when the bell rang , and Mr. Micawber walked with me to the lodge , and parted from me there with a blessing , I felt quite afraid to leave him by himself , he was so profoundly miserable . But through all the confusion and lowness of spirits in which we had been , so unexpectedly to me , involved , I plainly discerned that Mr. and Mrs. Micawber and their family were going away from London , and that a parting between us was near at hand . It was in my walk home that night , and in the sleepless hours which followed when I lay in bed , that the thought first occurred to me -- though I do n’t know how it came into my head -- which afterwards shaped itself into a settled resolution . I had grown to be so accustomed to the Micawbers , and had been so intimate with them in their distresses , and was so utterly friendless without them , that the prospect of being thrown upon some new shift for a lodging , and going once more among unknown people , was like being that moment turned adrift into my present life , with such a knowledge of it ready made as experience had given me . All the sensitive feelings it wounded so cruelly , all the shame and misery it kept alive within my breast , became more poignant as I thought of this ; and I determined that the life was unendurable . That there was no hope of escape from it , unless the escape was my own act , I knew quite well . I rarely heard from Miss Murdstone , and never from Mr. Murdstone : but two or three parcels of made or mended clothes had come up for me , consigned to Mr. Quinion , and in each there was a scrap of paper to the effect that J. M. trusted D. C. was applying himself to business , and devoting himself wholly to his duties -- not the least hint of my ever being anything else than the common drudge into which I was fast settling down . The very next day showed me , while my mind was in the first agitation of what it had conceived , that Mrs. Micawber had not spoken of their going away without warrant . They took a lodging in the house where I lived , for a week ; at the expiration of which time they were to start for Plymouth . Mr. Micawber himself came down to the counting - house , in the afternoon , to tell Mr. Quinion that he must relinquish me on the day of his departure , and to give me a high character , which I am sure I deserved . And Mr. Quinion , calling in Tipp the carman , who was a married man , and had a room to let , quartered me prospectively on him -- by our mutual consent , as he had every reason to think ; for I said nothing , though my resolution was now taken . I passed my evenings with Mr. and Mrs. Micawber , during the remaining term of our residence under the same roof ; and I think we became fonder of one another as the time went on . On the last Sunday , they invited me to dinner ; and we had a loin of pork and apple sauce , and a pudding . I had bought a spotted wooden horse over - night as a parting gift to little Wilkins Micawber -- that was the boy -- and a doll for little Emma . I had also bestowed a shilling on the Orfling , who was about to be disbanded . We had a very pleasant day , though we were all in a tender state about our approaching separation . ‘
87878	87883	87871	87871	I	0	’ said Mrs. Micawber , ‘

88335	88347	88305	88305	he	2146	’ Mr. Micawber looked aside at Mrs. Micawber , and added : ‘
88363	88376	88377	88377	My	0	’ After which , he was grave for a minute or so . ‘
88385	88390	88377	88377	My	0	’ said Mr. Micawber , ‘
88461	88560	88458	88458	I	0	’ To make his example the more impressive , Mr. Micawber drank a glass of punch with an air of great enjoyment and satisfaction , and whistled the College Hornpipe . I did not fail to assure him that I would store these precepts in my mind , though indeed I had no need to do so , for , at the time , they affected me visibly . Next morning I met the whole family at the coach office , and saw them , with a desolate heart , take their places outside , at the back . ‘
88564	88569	88561	88562	Master Copperfield	232	’ said Mrs. Micawber , ‘
88592	88593	88594	88594	Copperfield	232	’ ‘
88596	88601	88594	88594	Copperfield	232	’ said Mr. Micawber , ‘
88683	89672	89673	89674	Master David	232	’ I think , as Mrs. Micawber sat at the back of the coach , with the children , and I stood in the road looking wistfully at them , a mist cleared from her eyes , and she saw what a little creature I really was . I think so , because she beckoned to me to climb up , with quite a new and motherly expression in her face , and put her arm round my neck , and gave me just such a kiss as she might have given to her own boy . I had barely time to get down again before the coach started , and I could hardly see the family for the handkerchiefs they waved . It was gone in a minute . The Orfling and I stood looking vacantly at each other in the middle of the road , and then shook hands and said good - bye ; she going back , I suppose , to St. Luke ’s workhouse , as I went to begin my weary day at Murdstone and Grinby ’s . But with no intention of passing many more weary days there . No . I had resolved to run away.---To go , by some means or other , down into the country , to the only relation I had in the world , and tell my story to my aunt , Miss Betsey . I have already observed that I do n’t know how this desperate idea came into my brain . But , once there , it remained there ; and hardened into a purpose than which I have never entertained a more determined purpose in my life . I am far from sure that I believed there was anything hopeful in it , but my mind was thoroughly made up that it must be carried into execution . Again , and again , and a hundred times again , since the night when the thought had first occurred to me and banished sleep , I had gone over that old story of my poor mother ’s about my birth , which it had been one of my great delights in the old time to hear her tell , and which I knew by heart . My aunt walked into that story , and walked out of it , a dread and awful personage ; but there was one little trait in her behaviour which I liked to dwell on , and which gave me some faint shadow of encouragement . I could not forget how my mother had thought that she felt her touch her pretty hair with no ungentle hand ; and though it might have been altogether my mother ’s fancy , and might have had no foundation whatever in fact , I made a little picture , out of it , of my terrible aunt relenting towards the girlish beauty that I recollected so well and loved so much , which softened the whole narrative . It is very possible that it had been in my mind a long time , and had gradually engendered my determination . As I did not even know where Miss Betsey lived , I wrote a long letter to Peggotty , and asked her , incidentally , if she remembered ; pretending that I had heard of such a lady living at a certain place I named at random , and had a curiosity to know if it were the same . In the course of that letter , I told Peggotty that I had a particular occasion for half a guinea ; and that if she could lend me that sum until I could repay it , I should be very much obliged to her , and would tell her afterwards what I had wanted it for . Peggotty ’s answer soon arrived , and was , as usual , full of affectionate devotion . She enclosed the half guinea ( I was afraid she must have had a world of trouble to get it out of Mr. Barkis ’s box ) , and told me that Miss Betsey lived near Dover , but whether at Dover itself , at Hythe , Sandgate , or Folkestone , she could not say . One of our men , however , informing me on my asking him about these places , that they were all close together , I deemed this enough for my object , and resolved to set out at the end of that week . Being a very honest little creature , and unwilling to disgrace the memory I was going to leave behind me at Murdstone and Grinby ’s , I considered myself bound to remain until Saturday night ; and , as I had been paid a week ’s wages in advance when I first came there , not to present myself in the counting - house at the usual hour , to receive my stipend . For this express reason , I had borrowed the half - guinea , that I might not be without a fund for my travelling - expenses . Accordingly , when the Saturday night came , and we were all waiting in the warehouse to be paid , and Tipp the carman , who always took precedence , went in first to draw his money , I shook Mick Walker by the hand ; asked him , when it came to his turn to be paid , to say to Mr. Quinion that I had gone to move my box to Tipp ’s ; and , bidding a last good night to Mealy Potatoes , ran away . My box was at my old lodging , over the water , and I had written a direction for it on the back of one of our address cards that we nailed on the casks : ‘
89690	89785	89673	89674	Master David	232	’ This I had in my pocket ready to put on the box , after I should have got it out of the house ; and as I went towards my lodging , I looked about me for someone who would help me to carry it to the booking - office . There was a long - legged young man with a very little empty donkey - cart , standing near the Obelisk , in the Blackfriars Road , whose eye I caught as I was going by , and who , addressing me as ‘
89791	89793	89797	89797	him	2158	’ hoped ‘
89842	89846	89848	89853	the long - legged young man	2159	‘ Wot job ? ’
89855	89861	89862	89862	I	0	‘ To move a box , ’
89865	89869	89871	89876	the long - legged young man	2159	‘ Wot box ? ’
89905	89913	89915	89920	the long - legged young man	2159	‘ Done with you for a tanner ! ’
90237	90240	90242	90244	the young man	1774	‘ Wot ! ’
90258	90269	90242	90244	the young man	1774	‘ This is a pollis case , is it ? You ’re
90293	90294	90295	90295	You	1774	’ ‘
90306	90314	90295	90295	You	1774	’ said I , very much frightened ; ‘
90320	90321	90295	90295	You	1774	’ ‘
90327	90333	90334	90334	You	0	’ said the young man . ‘
90343	90344	90334	90334	You	0	’ ‘
90355	90369	90353	90353	you	1774	’ I cried , bursting into tears . The young man still replied : ‘
90375	90979	90353	90353	you	1774	’ and was dragging me against the donkey in a violent manner , as if there were any affinity between that animal and a magistrate , when he changed his mind , jumped into the cart , sat upon my box , and , exclaiming that he would drive to the pollis straight , rattled away harder than ever . I ran after him as fast as I could , but I had no breath to call out with , and should not have dared to call out , now , if I had . I narrowly escaped being run over , twenty times at least , in half a mile . Now I lost him , now I saw him , now I lost him , now I was cut at with a whip , now shouted at , now down in the mud , now up again , now running into somebody ’s arms , now running headlong at a post . At length , confused by fright and heat , and doubting whether half London might not by this time be turning out for my apprehension , I left the young man to go where he would with my box and money ; and , panting and crying , but never stopping , faced about for Greenwich , which I had understood was on the Dover Road : taking very little more out of the world , towards the retreat of my aunt , Miss Betsey , than I had brought into it , on the night when my arrival gave her so much umbrage . CHAPTER 13 . THE SEQUEL OF MY RESOLUTION For anything I know , I may have had some wild idea of running all the way to Dover , when I gave up the pursuit of the young man with the donkey - cart , and started for Greenwich . My scattered senses were soon collected as to that point , if I had ; for I came to a stop in the Kent Road , at a terrace with a piece of water before it , and a great foolish image in the middle , blowing a dry shell . Here I sat down on a doorstep , quite spent and exhausted with the efforts I had already made , and with hardly breath enough to cry for the loss of my box and half - guinea . It was by this time dark ; I heard the clocks strike ten , as I sat resting . But it was a summer night , fortunately , and fine weather . When I had recovered my breath , and had got rid of a stifling sensation in my throat , I rose up and went on . In the midst of my distress , I had no notion of going back . I doubt if I should have had any , though there had been a Swiss snow - drift in the Kent Road . But my standing possessed of only three - halfpence in the world ( and I am sure I wonder how they came to be left in my pocket on a Saturday night ! ) troubled me none the less because I went on . I began to picture to myself , as a scrap of newspaper intelligence , my being found dead in a day or two , under some hedge ; and I trudged on miserably , though as fast as I could , until I happened to pass a little shop , where it was written up that ladies ’
91134	91141	91142	91142	I	0	‘ If you please , sir , ’
91145	91156	91142	91142	I	0	‘ I am to sell this for a fair price . ’
91236	91252	91203	91203	his	358	‘ What do you call a price , now , for this here little weskit ? ’
91253	91262	91263	91263	I	0	‘ Oh ! you know best , sir , ’
91267	91277	91279	91280	Mr. Dolloby	358	‘ I ca n’t be buyer and seller too , ’
91282	91292	91279	91280	Mr. Dolloby	358	‘ Put a price on this here little weskit . ’
91293	91316	91317	91317	I	0	‘ Would eighteenpence be?’--I hinted , after some hesitation . Mr. Dolloby rolled it up again , and gave it me back . ‘
91323	91327	91279	91280	Mr. Dolloby	358	’ he said , ‘
91337	92342	91329	91329	I	0	’ This was a disagreeable way of putting the business ; because it imposed upon me , a perfect stranger , the unpleasantness of asking Mr. Dolloby to rob his family on my account . My circumstances being so very pressing , however , I said I would take ninepence for it , if he pleased . Mr. Dolloby , not without some grumbling , gave ninepence . I wished him good night , and walked out of the shop the richer by that sum , and the poorer by a waistcoat . But when I buttoned my jacket , that was not much . Indeed , I foresaw pretty clearly that my jacket would go next , and that I should have to make the best of my way to Dover in a shirt and a pair of trousers , and might deem myself lucky if I got there even in that trim . But my mind did not run so much on this as might be supposed . Beyond a general impression of the distance before me , and of the young man with the donkey - cart having used me cruelly , I think I had no very urgent sense of my difficulties when I once again set off with my ninepence in my pocket . A plan had occurred to me for passing the night , which I was going to carry into execution . This was , to lie behind the wall at the back of my old school , in a corner where there used to be a haystack . I imagined it would be a kind of company to have the boys , and the bedroom where I used to tell the stories , so near me : although the boys would know nothing of my being there , and the bedroom would yield me no shelter . I had had a hard day ’s work , and was pretty well jaded when I came climbing out , at last , upon the level of Blackheath . It cost me some trouble to find out Salem House ; but I found it , and I found a haystack in the corner , and I lay down by it ; having first walked round the wall , and looked up at the windows , and seen that all was dark and silent within . Never shall I forget the lonely sensation of first lying down , without a roof above my head ! Sleep came upon me as it came on many other outcasts , against whom house - doors were locked , and house - dogs barked , that night -- and I dreamed of lying on my old school - bed , talking to the boys in my room ; and found myself sitting upright , with Steerforth ’s name upon my lips , looking wildly at the stars that were glistening and glimmering above me . When I remembered where I was at that untimely hour , a feeling stole upon me that made me get up , afraid of I do n’t know what , and walk about . But the fainter glimmering of the stars , and the pale light in the sky where the day was coming , reassured me : and my eyes being very heavy , I lay down again and slept -- though with a knowledge in my sleep that it was cold -- until the warm beams of the sun , and the ringing of the getting - up bell at Salem House , awoke me . If I could have hoped that Steerforth was there , I would have lurked about until he came out alone ; but I knew he must have left long since . Traddles still remained , perhaps , but it was very doubtful ; and I had not sufficient confidence in his discretion or good luck , however strong my reliance was on his good nature , to wish to trust him with my situation . So I crept away from the wall as Mr. Creakle ’s boys were getting up , and struck into the long dusty track which I had first known to be the Dover Road when I was one of them , and when I little expected that any eyes would ever see me the wayfarer I was now , upon it . What a different Sunday morning from the old Sunday morning at Yarmouth ! In due time I heard the church - bells ringing , as I plodded on ; and I met people who were going to church ; and I passed a church or two where the congregation were inside , and the sound of singing came out into the sunshine , while the beadle sat and cooled himself in the shade of the porch , or stood beneath the yew - tree , with his hand to his forehead , glowering at me going by . But the peace and rest of the old Sunday morning were on everything , except me . That was the difference . I felt quite wicked in my dirt and dust , with my tangled hair . But for the quiet picture I had conjured up , of my mother in her youth and beauty , weeping by the fire , and my aunt relenting to her , I hardly think I should have had the courage to go on until next day . But it always went before me , and I followed . I got , that Sunday , through three - and - twenty miles on the straight road , though not very easily , for I was new to that kind of toil . I see myself , as evening closes in , coming over the bridge at Rochester , footsore and tired , and eating bread that I had bought for supper . One or two little houses , with the notice , ‘
92346	92785	91329	91329	I	0	’ , hanging out , had tempted me ; but I was afraid of spending the few pence I had , and was even more afraid of the vicious looks of the trampers I had met or overtaken . I sought no shelter , therefore , but the sky ; and toiling into Chatham,--which , in that night ’s aspect , is a mere dream of chalk , and drawbridges , and mastless ships in a muddy river , roofed like Noah ’s arks,--crept , at last , upon a sort of grass - grown battery overhanging a lane , where a sentry was walking to and fro . Here I lay down , near a cannon ; and , happy in the society of the sentry ’s footsteps , though he knew no more of my being above him than the boys at Salem House had known of my lying by the wall , slept soundly until morning . Very stiff and sore of foot I was in the morning , and quite dazed by the beating of drums and marching of troops , which seemed to hem me in on every side when I went down towards the long narrow street . Feeling that I could go but a very little way that day , if I were to reserve any strength for getting to my journey ’s end , I resolved to make the sale of my jacket its principal business . Accordingly , I took the jacket off , that I might learn to do without it ; and carrying it under my arm , began a tour of inspection of the various slop - shops . It was a likely place to sell a jacket in ; for the dealers in second - hand clothes were numerous , and were , generally speaking , on the look - out for customers at their shop doors . But as most of them had , hanging up among their stock , an officer ’s coat or two , epaulettes and all , I was rendered timid by the costly nature of their dealings , and walked about for a long time without offering my merchandise to anyone . This modesty of mine directed my attention to the marine - store shops , and such shops as Mr. Dolloby ’s , in preference to the regular dealers . At last I found one that I thought looked promising , at the corner of a dirty lane , ending in an enclosure full of stinging - nettles , against the palings of which some second - hand sailors ’
92985	92993	92995	92997	this old man	2201	‘ Oh , what do you want ? ’
93006	93037	92995	92997	this old man	2201	‘ Oh , my eyes and limbs , what do you want ? Oh , my lungs and liver , what do you want ? Oh , goroo , goroo ! ’
93089	93142	93076	93078	the old man	9777	‘ Oh , what do you want ? Oh , my eyes and limbs , what do you want ? Oh , my lungs and liver , what do you want ? Oh , goroo!’--which he screwed out of himself , with an energy that made his eyes start in his head . ‘
93148	93154	93076	93078	the old man	9777	’ I said , trembling , ‘
93162	93163	93076	93078	the old man	9777	’ ‘
93172	93178	93076	93078	the old man	9777	’ cried the old man . ‘
93204	93245	93076	93078	the old man	9777	’ With that he took his trembling hands , which were like the claws of a great bird , out of my hair ; and put on a pair of spectacles , not at all ornamental to his inflamed eyes . ‘
93254	93264	93076	93078	the old man	9777	’ cried the old man , after examining it . ‘
93273	93274	93076	93078	the old man	9777	’ ‘
93281	93288	93076	93078	the old man	9777	’ I answered , recovering myself . ‘
93296	93302	93076	93078	the old man	9777	’ cried the old man , ‘
93323	93391	93321	93321	Goroo	360	’ Every time he uttered this ejaculation , his eyes seemed to be in danger of starting out ; and every sentence he spoke , he delivered in a sort of tune , always exactly the same , and more like a gust of wind , which begins low , mounts up high , and falls again , than any other comparison I can find for it . ‘
93394	93405	93321	93321	Goroo	360	’ said I , glad to have closed the bargain , ‘
93411	93412	93321	93321	Goroo	360	’ ‘
93418	93431	93321	93321	Goroo	360	’ cried the old man , throwing the jacket on a shelf . ‘
93466	93640	93641	93641	You	2206	’ I never was so frightened in my life , before or since ; but I told him humbly that I wanted money , and that nothing else was of any use to me , but that I would wait for it , as he desired , outside , and had no wish to hurry him . So I went outside , and sat down in the shade in a corner . And I sat there so many hours , that the shade became sunlight , and the sunlight became shade again , and still I sat there waiting for the money . There never was such another drunken madman in that line of business , I hope . That he was well known in the neighbourhood , and enjoyed the reputation of having sold himself to the devil , I soon understood from the visits he received from the boys , who continually came skirmishing about the shop , shouting that legend , and calling to him to bring out his gold . ‘
93696	93814	93817	93817	Nelson	361	’ This , and many offers to lend him a knife for the purpose , exasperated him to such a degree , that the whole day was a succession of rushes on his part , and flights on the part of the boys . Sometimes in his rage he would take me for one of them , and come at me , mouthing as if he were going to tear me in pieces ; then , remembering me , just in time , would dive into the shop , and lie upon his bed , as I thought from the sound of his voice , yelling in a frantic way , to his own windy tune , the ‘
93818	93980	93983	93983	my	0	’ ; with an Oh ! before every line , and innumerable Goroos interspersed . As if this were not bad enough for me , the boys , connecting me with the establishment , on account of the patience and perseverance with which I sat outside , half - dressed , pelted me , and used me very ill all day . He made many attempts to induce me to consent to an exchange ; at one time coming out with a fishing - rod , at another with a fiddle , at another with a cocked hat , at another with a flute . But I resisted all these overtures , and sat there in desperation ; each time asking him , with tears in my eyes , for my money or my jacket . At last he began to pay me in halfpence at a time ; and was full two hours getting by easy stages to a shilling . ‘
93988	94005	93983	93983	my	0	’ he then cried , peeping hideously out of the shop , after a long pause , ‘
94013	94014	94015	94015	I	0	’ ‘
94019	94023	94015	94015	I	0	’ I said ; ‘
94029	94030	94015	94015	I	0	’ ‘
94044	94045	94039	94039	you	2208	’ ‘
94056	94060	94039	94039	you	2208	’ I said , ‘
94068	94069	94062	94062	I	0	’ ‘
94076	94113	94115	94115	you	2208	’ ( it is really impossible to express how he twisted this ejaculation out of himself , as he peeped round the door - post at me , showing nothing but his crafty old head ) ; ‘
94120	94451	94115	94115	you	2208	’ I was so faint and weary that I closed with this offer ; and taking the money out of his claw , not without trembling , went away more hungry and thirsty than I had ever been , a little before sunset . But at an expense of threepence I soon refreshed myself completely ; and , being in better spirits then , limped seven miles upon my road . My bed at night was under another haystack , where I rested comfortably , after having washed my blistered feet in a stream , and dressed them as well as I was able , with some cool leaves . When I took the road again next morning , I found that it lay through a succession of hop - grounds and orchards . It was sufficiently late in the year for the orchards to be ruddy with ripe apples ; and in a few places the hop - pickers were already at work . I thought it all extremely beautiful , and made up my mind to sleep among the hops that night : imagining some cheerful companionship in the long perspectives of poles , with the graceful leaves twining round them . The trampers were worse than ever that day , and inspired me with a dread that is yet quite fresh in my mind . Some of them were most ferocious - looking ruffians , who stared at me as I went by ; and stopped , perhaps , and called after me to come back and speak to them , and when I took to my heels , stoned me . I recollect one young fellow -- a tinker , I suppose , from his wallet and brazier -- who had a woman with him , and who faced about and stared at me thus ; and then roared to me in such a tremendous voice to come back , that I halted and looked round . ‘

94682	94697	94679	94680	the tinker	2210	‘ If you have , out with it , afore I take it away ! ’

95701	95717	95661	95661	I	0	’ My heart sank within me as I acknowledged the undoubted accuracy of this description . ‘
95726	95730	95721	95721	I	0	’ said he . ‘
95737	95746	95732	95732	you	0	’ pointing with his whip towards the heights , ‘
95786	95915	95916	95917	My mistress	1091	’ I accepted the gift thankfully , and bought a loaf with it . Dispatching this refreshment by the way , I went in the direction my friend had indicated , and walked on a good distance without coming to the houses he had mentioned . At length I saw some before me ; and approaching them , went into a little shop ( it was what we used to call a general shop , at home ) , and inquired if they could have the goodness to tell me where Miss Trotwood lived . I addressed myself to a man behind the counter , who was weighing some rice for a young woman ; but the latter , taking the inquiry to herself , turned round quickly . ‘
95919	95923	95916	95917	My mistress	1091	’ she said . ‘
95933	95934	95926	95926	you	0	’ ‘
95938	95942	95935	95935	I	0	’ I replied , ‘

95962	95967	95959	95959	you	0	’ retorted the damsel . ‘
95970	95974	95959	95959	you	0	’ I said , ‘
95977	96125	95959	95959	you	0	’ But suddenly remembering that in truth I came for no other purpose , I held my peace in confusion , and felt my face burn . My aunt ’s handmaid , as I supposed she was from what she had said , put her rice in a little basket and walked out of the shop ; telling me that I could follow her , if I wanted to know where Miss Trotwood lived . I needed no second permission ; though I was by this time in such a state of consternation and agitation , that my legs shook under me . I followed the young woman , and we soon came to a very neat little cottage with cheerful bow - windows : in front of it , a small square gravelled court or garden full of flowers , carefully tended , and smelling deliciously . ‘
96132	96138	96128	96129	Miss Trotwood	228	’ said the young woman . ‘
96153	96662	96147	96147	I	0	’ With which words she hurried into the house , as if to shake off the responsibility of my appearance ; and left me standing at the garden - gate , looking disconsolately over the top of it towards the parlour window , where a muslin curtain partly undrawn in the middle , a large round green screen or fan fastened on to the windowsill , a small table , and a great chair , suggested to me that my aunt might be at that moment seated in awful state . My shoes were by this time in a woeful condition . The soles had shed themselves bit by bit , and the upper leathers had broken and burst until the very shape and form of shoes had departed from them . My hat ( which had served me for a night - cap , too ) was so crushed and bent , that no old battered handleless saucepan on a dunghill need have been ashamed to vie with it . My shirt and trousers , stained with heat , dew , grass , and the Kentish soil on which I had slept -- and torn besides -- might have frightened the birds from my aunt ’s garden , as I stood at the gate . My hair had known no comb or brush since I left London . My face , neck , and hands , from unaccustomed exposure to the air and sun , were burnt to a berry - brown . From head to foot I was powdered almost as white with chalk and dust , as if I had come out of a lime - kiln . In this plight , and with a strong consciousness of it , I waited to introduce myself to , and make my first impression on , my formidable aunt . The unbroken stillness of the parlour window leading me to infer , after a while , that she was not there , I lifted up my eyes to the window above it , where I saw a florid , pleasant - looking gentleman , with a grey head , who shut up one eye in a grotesque manner , nodded his head at me several times , shook it at me as often , laughed , and went away . I had been discomposed enough before ; but I was so much the more discomposed by this unexpected behaviour , that I was on the point of slinking off , to think how I had best proceed , when there came out of the house a lady with her handkerchief tied over her cap , and a pair of gardening gloves on her hands , wearing a gardening pocket like a toll - man ’s apron , and carrying a great knife . I knew her immediately to be Miss Betsey , for she came stalking out of the house exactly as my poor mother had so often described her stalking up our garden at Blunderstone Rookery . ‘
96666	96687	96147	96147	I	0	’ said Miss Betsey , shaking her head , and making a distant chop in the air with her knife . ‘
96695	96758	96760	96760	you	2259	’ I watched her , with my heart at my lips , as she marched to a corner of her garden , and stooped to dig up some little root there . Then , without a scrap of courage , but with a great deal of desperation , I went softly in and stood beside her , touching her with my finger . ‘
96765	96775	96777	96777	you	2259	’ I began . She started and looked up . ‘
96782	96783	96777	96777	you	2259	’ ‘
96786	96802	96777	96777	you	2259	’ exclaimed Miss Betsey , in a tone of amazement I have never heard approached . ‘
96814	96815	96809	96809	I	0	’ ‘
96820	96835	96809	96809	I	0	’ said my aunt . And sat flat down in the garden - path . ‘
96933	97180	96928	96928	I	0	’ Here my self - support gave way all at once ; and with a movement of my hands , intended to show her my ragged state , and call it to witness that I had suffered something , I broke into a passion of crying , which I suppose had been pent up within me all the week . My aunt , with every sort of expression but wonder discharged from her countenance , sat on the gravel , staring at me , until I began to cry ; when she got up in a great hurry , collared me , and took me into the parlour . Her first proceeding there was to unlock a tall press , bring out several bottles , and pour some of the contents of each into my mouth . I think they must have been taken out at random , for I am sure I tasted aniseed water , anchovy sauce , and salad dressing . When she had administered these restoratives , as I was still quite hysterical , and unable to control my sobs , she put me on the sofa , with a shawl under my head , and the handkerchief from her own head under my feet , lest I should sully the cover ; and then , sitting herself down behind the green fan or screen I have already mentioned , so that I could not see her face , ejaculated at intervals , ‘
97185	97202	97203	97203	Janet	362	’ letting those exclamations off like minute guns . After a time she rang the bell . ‘
97205	97216	97203	97203	Janet	362	’ said my aunt , when her servant came in . ‘
97236	97304	97229	97229	I	0	’ Janet looked a little surprised to see me lying stiffly on the sofa ( I was afraid to move lest it should be displeasing to my aunt ) , but went on her errand . My aunt , with her hands behind her , walked up and down the room , until the gentleman who had squinted at me from the upper window came in laughing . ‘
97308	97313	97305	97306	Mr. Dick	363	’ said my aunt , ‘
97350	97378	97343	97344	a fool	902	’ The gentleman was serious immediately , and looked at me , I thought , as if he would entreat me to say nothing about the window . ‘
97382	97387	97379	97380	Mr. Dick	363	’ said my aunt , ‘
97413	97414	97407	97407	you	363	’ ‘
97418	97435	97415	97416	David Copperfield	232	’ said Mr. Dick , who did not appear to me to remember much about it . ‘
97450	97451	97446	97446	David	232	’ ‘
97454	97459	97446	97446	David	232	’ said my aunt , ‘
97493	97494	97495	97495	His	232	’ ‘
97498	97503	97495	97495	His	232	’ said Mr. Dick . ‘

97514	97519	97495	97495	His	232	’ pursued my aunt , ‘
97549	97571	97537	97538	His sister	8825	’ My aunt shook her head firmly , confident in the character and behaviour of the girl who never was born . ‘
97583	97588	97576	97576	she	8825	’ said Mr. Dick . ‘
97595	97602	97576	97576	she	8825	’ exclaimed my aunt , sharply , ‘
97657	97658	97647	97648	Betsey Trotwood	228	’ ‘
97661	97666	97647	97648	Betsey Trotwood	228	’ said Mr. Dick . ‘
97670	97680	97683	97683	you	2279	’ returned my aunt , softened by the reply , ‘
97729	97730	97724	97724	I	0	’ ‘
97738	97749	97733	97733	you	2279	’ said Mr. Dick , feebly , scratching his head . ‘
97756	97757	97733	97733	you	2279	’ ‘
97760	97776	97733	97733	you	2279	’ said my aunt , with a grave look , and her forefinger held up . ‘
97786	97787	97779	97779	I	0	’ ‘
97795	97808	97793	97793	you	2279	’ said Mr. Dick , considering , and looking vacantly at me , ‘
97811	97831	97832	97832	I	0	’ The contemplation of me seemed to inspire him with a sudden idea , and he added , briskly , ‘
97837	97838	97839	97839	Janet	362	’ ‘
97841	97860	97861	97862	Mr. Dick	363	’ said my aunt , turning round with a quiet triumph , which I did not then understand , ‘
97872	98205	97861	97862	Mr. Dick	363	’ Although I was deeply interested in this dialogue , I could not help observing my aunt , Mr. Dick , and Janet , while it was in progress , and completing a survey I had already been engaged in making of the room . My aunt was a tall , hard - featured lady , but by no means ill - looking . There was an inflexibility in her face , in her voice , in her gait and carriage , amply sufficient to account for the effect she had made upon a gentle creature like my mother ; but her features were rather handsome than otherwise , though unbending and austere . I particularly noticed that she had a very quick , bright eye . Her hair , which was grey , was arranged in two plain divisions , under what I believe would be called a mob - cap ; I mean a cap , much more common then than now , with side - pieces fastening under the chin . Her dress was of a lavender colour , and perfectly neat ; but scantily made , as if she desired to be as little encumbered as possible . I remember that I thought it , in form , more like a riding - habit with the superfluous skirt cut off , than anything else . She wore at her side a gentleman ’s gold watch , if I might judge from its size and make , with an appropriate chain and seals ; she had some linen at her throat not unlike a shirt - collar , and things at her wrists like little shirt - wristbands . Mr. Dick , as I have already said , was grey - headed , and florid : I should have said all about him , in saying so , had not his head been curiously bowed -- not by age ; it reminded me of one of Mr. Creakle ’s boys ’
98587	98592	98563	98564	my aunt	731	‘ Janet ! Donkeys ! ’
99021	99026	99011	99011	she	731	‘ Janet ! Donkeys ! ’
99222	99226	99185	99186	my aunt	731	‘ Pretty fellow , ’
99228	99232	99185	99186	my aunt	731	‘ Poor fellow , ’
99392	99397	99379	99379	she	731	‘ Mercy upon us ! ’
99516	99533	99535	99536	my aunt	731	‘ Whatever possessed that poor unfortunate Baby , that she must go and be married again , ’
99543	99549	99535	99536	my aunt	731	‘ I ca n’t conceive . ’
99550	99561	99562	99563	Mr. Dick	363	‘ Perhaps she fell in love with her second husband , ’
99566	99571	99562	99563	Mr. Dick	363	‘ Fell in love ! ’
99576	99590	99562	99563	Mr. Dick	363	‘ What do you mean ? What business had she to do it ? ’
99591	99594	99595	99596	Mr. Dick	363	‘ Perhaps , ’
99604	99611	99595	99596	Mr. Dick	363	‘ she did it for pleasure . ’
99612	99617	99619	99620	my aunt	731	‘ Pleasure , indeed ! ’
99622	99727	99619	99620	my aunt	731	‘ A mighty pleasure for the poor Baby to fix her simple faith upon any dog of a fellow , certain to ill - use her in some way or other . What did she propose to herself , I should like to know ! She had had one husband . She had seen David Copperfield out of the world , who was always running after wax dolls from his cradle . She had got a baby -- oh , there were a pair of babies when she gave birth to this child sitting here , that Friday night!--and what more did she want ? ’
99748	99760	99732	99732	his	363	‘ She could n’t even have a baby like anybody else , ’
99765	99784	99732	99732	his	363	‘ Where was this child ’s sister , Betsey Trotwood ? Not forthcoming . Do n’t tell me ! ’
99791	99806	99785	99786	Mr. Dick	363	‘ That little man of a doctor , with his head on one side , ’
99811	99861	99785	99786	Mr. Dick	363	‘ Jellips , or whatever his name was , what was he about ? All he could do , was to say to me , like a robin redbreast -- as he is--“It ’s a boy . ” A boy ! Yah , the imbecility of the whole set of ‘
99864	99888	99900	99900	she	731	’ The heartiness of the ejaculation startled Mr. Dick exceedingly ; and me , too , if I am to tell the truth . ‘
99917	99922	99923	99923	she	731	’ said my aunt , ‘
99989	100006	99977	99977	Cain	365	’ Mr. Dick looked hard at me , as if to identify me in this character . ‘
100018	100023	100011	100015	that woman with the Pagan	2339	’ said my aunt , ‘
100063	100072	100059	100059	I	0	’ said my aunt , shaking her head , ‘
100096	100285	100079	100086	those Poker husbands who abound in the newspapers	2342	’ I could not bear to hear my old nurse so decried , and made the subject of such a wish . I told my aunt that indeed she was mistaken . That Peggotty was the best , the truest , the most faithful , most devoted , and most self - denying friend and servant in the world ; who had ever loved me dearly , who had ever loved my mother dearly ; who had held my mother ’s dying head upon her arm , on whose face my mother had imprinted her last grateful kiss . And my remembrance of them both , choking me , I broke down as I was trying to say that her home was my home , and that all she had was mine , and that I would have gone to her for shelter , but for her humble station , which made me fear that I might bring some trouble on her -- I broke down , I say , as I was trying to say so , and laid my face in my hands upon the table . ‘
100290	100295	100079	100086	those Poker husbands who abound in the newspapers	2342	’ said my aunt , ‘
100314	100488	100310	100310	Janet	362	’ I thoroughly believe that but for those unfortunate donkeys , we should have come to a good understanding ; for my aunt had laid her hand on my shoulder , and the impulse was upon me , thus emboldened , to embrace her and beseech her protection . But the interruption , and the disorder she was thrown into by the struggle outside , put an end to all softer ideas for the present , and kept my aunt indignantly declaiming to Mr. Dick about her determination to appeal for redress to the laws of her country , and to bring actions for trespass against the whole donkey proprietorship of Dover , until tea - time . After tea , we sat at the window -- on the look - out , as I imagined , from my aunt ’s sharp expression of face , for more invaders -- until dusk , when Janet set candles , and a backgammon - board , on the table , and pulled down the blinds . ‘
100494	100511	100491	100492	Mr. Dick	363	’ said my aunt , with her grave look , and her forefinger up as before , ‘
100526	100527	100528	100528	David	232	’ ‘
100532	100544	100528	100528	David	232	’ said Mr. Dick , with an attentive , puzzled face . ‘
100548	100553	100556	100556	you	363	’ returned my aunt . ‘
100563	100564	100556	100556	you	363	’ ‘
100571	100576	100567	100567	David	232	’ said Mr. Dick . ‘
100579	100584	100567	100567	David	232	’ replied my aunt , ‘
100590	100591	100586	100586	David	232	’ ‘
100594	100599	100586	100586	David	232	’ said Mr. Dick . ‘

100616	100632	100633	100634	Mr. Dick	363	’ cried my aunt , with the same complacent triumph that I had remarked before . ‘
100654	101382	100646	100646	we	2348	’ Janet reporting it to be quite ready , I was taken up to it ; kindly , but in some sort like a prisoner ; my aunt going in front and Janet bringing up the rear . The only circumstance which gave me any new hope , was my aunt ’s stopping on the stairs to inquire about a smell of fire that was prevalent there ; and janet ’s replying that she had been making tinder down in the kitchen , of my old shirt . But there were no other clothes in my room than the odd heap of things I wore ; and when I was left there , with a little taper which my aunt forewarned me would burn exactly five minutes , I heard them lock my door on the outside . Turning these things over in my mind I deemed it possible that my aunt , who could know nothing of me , might suspect I had a habit of running away , and took precautions , on that account , to have me in safe keeping . The room was a pleasant one , at the top of the house , overlooking the sea , on which the moon was shining brilliantly . After I had said my prayers , and the candle had burnt out , I remember how I still sat looking at the moonlight on the water , as if I could hope to read my fortune in it , as in a bright book ; or to see my mother with her child , coming from Heaven , along that shining path , to look upon me as she had looked when I last saw her sweet face . I remember how the solemn feeling with which at length I turned my eyes away , yielded to the sensation of gratitude and rest which the sight of the white - curtained bed -- and how much more the lying softly down upon it , nestling in the snow - white sheets!--inspired . I remember how I thought of all the solitary places under the night sky where I had slept , and how I prayed that I never might be houseless any more , and never might forget the houseless . I remember how I seemed to float , then , down the melancholy glory of that track upon the sea , away into the world of dreams . CHAPTER 14 . MY AUNT MAKES UP HER MIND ABOUT ME On going down in the morning , I found my aunt musing so profoundly over the breakfast table , with her elbow on the tray , that the contents of the urn had overflowed the teapot and were laying the whole table - cloth under water , when my entrance put her meditations to flight . I felt sure that I had been the subject of her reflections , and was more than ever anxious to know her intentions towards me . Yet I dared not express my anxiety , lest it should give her offence . My eyes , however , not being so much under control as my tongue , were attracted towards my aunt very often during breakfast . I never could look at her for a few moments together but I found her looking at me -- in an odd thoughtful manner , as if I were an immense way off , instead of being on the other side of the small round table . When she had finished her breakfast , my aunt very deliberately leaned back in her chair , knitted her brows , folded her arms , and contemplated me at her leisure , with such a fixedness of attention that I was quite overpowered by embarrassment . Not having as yet finished my own breakfast , I attempted to hide my confusion by proceeding with it ; but my knife tumbled over my fork , my fork tripped up my knife , I chipped bits of bacon a surprising height into the air instead of cutting them for my own eating , and choked myself with my tea , which persisted in going the wrong way instead of the right one , until I gave in altogether , and sat blushing under my aunt ’s close scrutiny . ‘
101385	101407	101383	101383	Hallo	301	’ said my aunt , after a long time . I looked up , and met her sharp bright glance respectfully . ‘
101414	101419	101408	101408	I	0	’ said my aunt . ‘
101422	101423	101408	101408	I	0	’ ‘
101432	101437	101438	101438	I	0	’ said my aunt . ‘

101477	101483	101484	101484	I	0	’ I inquired , alarmed . ‘
101489	101498	101484	101484	I	0	’ said my aunt , with a nod . ‘
101509	101513	101514	101514	I	0	’ I faltered . ‘
101519	101524	101514	101514	I	0	’ said my aunt . ‘
101529	101530	101525	101525	We	2352	’ ‘
101542	101546	101538	101538	I	0	’ I exclaimed , ‘

101567	101576	101577	101577	I	0	’ said my aunt , shaking her head . ‘
101590	101803	101804	101804	I	0	’ My spirits sank under these words , and I became very downcast and heavy of heart . My aunt , without appearing to take much heed of me , put on a coarse apron with a bib , which she took out of the press ; washed up the teacups with her own hands ; and , when everything was washed and set in the tray again , and the cloth folded and put on the top of the whole , rang for Janet to remove it . She next swept up the crumbs with a little broom ( putting on a pair of gloves first ) , until there did not appear to be one microscopic speck left on the carpet ; next dusted and arranged the room , which was dusted and arranged to a hair ’s breadth already . When all these tasks were performed to her satisfaction , she took off the gloves and apron , folded them up , put them in the particular corner of the press from which they had been taken , brought out her work - box to her own table in the open window , and sat down , with the green fan between her and the light , to work . ‘
101811	101822	101806	101806	you	2353	’ said my aunt , as she threaded her needle , ‘
101846	101860	101861	101861	I	0	’ I rose with all alacrity , to acquit myself of this commission . ‘
101864	101883	101884	101884	you	2353	’ said my aunt , eyeing me as narrowly as she had eyed the needle in threading it , ‘
101894	101895	101884	101884	you	2353	’ ‘
101907	101911	101896	101896	I	0	’ I confessed . ‘
101933	101943	101944	101944	Babley	366	’ said my aunt , with a loftier air . ‘
101958	102003	101952	101953	the gentleman	8663	’ I was going to suggest , with a modest sense of my youth and the familiarity I had been already guilty of , that I had better give him the full benefit of that name , when my aunt went on to say : ‘
102113	102265	102110	102111	Mr. Dick	363	’ I promised to obey , and went upstairs with my message ; thinking , as I went , that if Mr. Dick had been working at his Memorial long , at the same rate as I had seen him working at it , through the open door , when I came down , he was probably getting on very well indeed . I found him still driving at it with a long pen , and his head almost laid upon the paper . He was so intent upon it , that I had ample leisure to observe the large paper kite in a corner , the confusion of bundles of manuscript , the number of pens , and , above all , the quantity of ink ( which he seemed to have in , in half - gallon jars by the dozen ) , before he observed my being present . ‘
102270	102280	102268	102268	Phoebus	367	’ said Mr. Dick , laying down his pen . ‘
102293	102302	102287	102287	I	0	’ he added , in a lower tone , ‘
102316	102342	102344	102345	Mr. Dick	363	’ here he beckoned to me , and put his lips close to my ear--‘it ’s a mad world . Mad as Bedlam , boy ! ’
102376	102379	102381	102382	Mr. Dick	363	‘ Well , ’
102387	102412	102414	102415	Mr. Dick	363	‘ my compliments to her , and I -- I believe I have made a start . I think I have made a start , ’
102436	102443	102414	102415	Mr. Dick	363	‘ You have been to school ? ’
102444	102449	102450	102450	I	0	‘ Yes , sir , ’
102453	102459	102450	102450	I	0	‘ for a short time . ’
102460	102467	102469	102470	Mr. Dick	363	‘ Do you recollect the date , ’
102487	102499	102500	102500	I	0	‘ when King Charles the First had his head cut off ? ’
102516	102519	102521	102522	Mr. Dick	363	‘ Well , ’
102537	102592	102525	102525	his	363	‘ So the books say ; but I do n’t see how that can be . Because , if it was so long ago , how could the people about him have made that mistake of putting some of the trouble out of his head , after it was taken off , into mine ? ’
102611	102617	102619	102620	Mr. Dick	363	‘ It ’s very strange , ’
102639	102664	102665	102665	he	363	‘ that I never can get that quite right . I never can make that perfectly clear . But no matter , no matter ! ’
102673	102693	102665	102665	he	363	‘ there ’s time enough ! My compliments to Miss Trotwood , I am getting on very well indeed . ’
102708	102719	102720	102720	he	363	‘ What do you think of that for a kite ? ’
102746	102762	102764	102765	Mr. Dick	363	‘ I made it . We ’ll go and fly it , you and I , ’

102835	102856	102857	102857	em	2360	‘ and when it flies high , it takes the facts a long way . That ’s my manner of diffusing ‘
102891	102950	102884	102884	I	0	’ His face was so very mild and pleasant , and had something so reverend in it , though it was hale and hearty , that I was not sure but that he was having a good - humoured jest with me . So I laughed , and he laughed , and we parted the best friends possible . ‘
102955	102965	102884	102884	I	0	’ said my aunt , when I went downstairs . ‘
102975	102993	102969	102970	Mr. Dick	363	’ I informed her that he sent his compliments , and was getting on very well indeed . ‘
103001	103059	102996	102996	you	363	’ said my aunt . I had some shadowy idea of endeavouring to evade the question , by replying that I thought him a very nice gentleman ; but my aunt was not to be so put off , for she laid her work down in her lap , and said , folding her hands upon it : ‘
103091	103092	103094	103094	he	2365	’ ‘
103121	103134	103111	103111	he	2365	’ I stammered ; for I felt I was on dangerous ground . ‘
103139	103144	103111	103111	he	2365	’ said my aunt . ‘
103149	103154	103111	103111	he	2365	’ I observed faintly . ‘
103163	103176	103111	103111	he	2365	’ said my aunt , with great decision and force of manner , ‘
103187	103199	103111	103111	he	2365	’ I had nothing better to offer , than another timid , ‘
103204	103205	103111	103111	he	2365	’ ‘
103212	103217	103206	103206	He	2365	’ said my aunt . ‘

103273	103277	103281	103281	they	2370	’ I said . ‘
103293	103298	103299	103300	Mr. Dick	363	’ pursued my aunt . ‘
103346	103378	103379	103381	A proud fool	2372	’ I am afraid it was hypocritical in me , but seeing that my aunt felt strongly on the subject , I tried to look as if I felt strongly too . ‘
103383	103388	103379	103381	A proud fool	2372	’ said my aunt . ‘
103472	103490	103467	103467	himself	2373	’ Again , as my aunt looked quite convinced , I endeavoured to look quite convinced also . ‘
103496	103501	103492	103492	I	0	’ said my aunt , ‘
103600	103605	103606	103606	I	0	’ said my aunt , ‘
103645	103678	103679	103679	He	9020	’ My aunt smoothed her dress and shook her head , as if she smoothed defiance of the whole world out of the one , and shook it out of the other . ‘
103685	103690	103691	103693	a good creature	2389	’ said my aunt , ‘
103804	103805	103808	103808	aunt	2261	’ ‘
103810	103811	103808	103808	aunt	2261	’ ‘
103814	103830	103808	103808	aunt	2261	’ said my aunt , rubbing her nose as if she were a little vexed . ‘
103885	103889	103892	103892	aunt	2261	’ I said : ‘
103894	103895	103892	103892	aunt	2261	’ ‘
103907	103912	103892	103892	aunt	2261	’ said my aunt , ‘
103948	103949	103963	103963	aunt	2261	’ ‘
103965	103966	103969	103969	child	8492	’ ‘
103971	103981	103969	103969	child	8492	’ said my aunt , rubbing her nose again . ‘
104058	104102	104103	104103	I	0	’ In fact , I found out afterwards that Mr. Dick had been for upwards of ten years endeavouring to keep King Charles the First out of the Memorial ; but he had been constantly getting into it , and was there now . ‘
104107	104112	104103	104103	I	0	’ said my aunt , ‘
104189	104808	104846	104846	you	2406	’ If I could have supposed that my aunt had recounted these particulars for my especial behoof , and as a piece of confidence in me , I should have felt very much distinguished , and should have augured favourably from such a mark of her good opinion . But I could hardly help observing that she had launched into them , chiefly because the question was raised in her own mind , and with very little reference to me , though she had addressed herself to me in the absence of anybody else . At the same time , I must say that the generosity of her championship of poor harmless Mr. Dick , not only inspired my young breast with some selfish hope for myself , but warmed it unselfishly towards her . I believe that I began to know that there was something about my aunt , notwithstanding her many eccentricities and odd humours , to be honoured and trusted in . Though she was just as sharp that day as on the day before , and was in and out about the donkeys just as often , and was thrown into a tremendous state of indignation , when a young man , going by , ogled Janet at a window ( which was one of the gravest misdemeanours that could be committed against my aunt ’s dignity ) , she seemed to me to command more of my respect , if not less of my fear . The anxiety I underwent , in the interval which necessarily elapsed before a reply could be received to her letter to Mr. Murdstone , was extreme ; but I made an endeavour to suppress it , and to be as agreeable as I could in a quiet way , both to my aunt and Mr. Dick . The latter and I would have gone out to fly the great kite ; but that I had still no other clothes than the anything but ornamental garments with which I had been decorated on the first day , and which confined me to the house , except for an hour after dark , when my aunt , for my health ’s sake , paraded me up and down on the cliff outside , before going to bed . At length the reply from Mr. Murdstone came , and my aunt informed me , to my infinite terror , that he was coming to speak to her herself on the next day . On the next day , still bundled up in my curious habiliments , I sat counting the time , flushed and heated by the conflict of sinking hopes and rising fears within me ; and waiting to be startled by the sight of the gloomy face , whose non - arrival startled me every minute . My aunt was a little more imperious and stern than usual , but I observed no other token of her preparing herself to receive the visitor so much dreaded by me . She sat at work in the window , and I sat by , with my thoughts running astray on all possible and impossible results of Mr. Murdstone ’s visit , until pretty late in the afternoon . Our dinner had been indefinitely postponed ; but it was growing so late , that my aunt had ordered it to be got ready , when she gave a sudden alarm of donkeys , and to my consternation and amazement , I beheld Miss Murdstone , on a side - saddle , ride deliberately over the sacred piece of green , and stop in front of the house , looking about her . ‘
104814	104829	104846	104846	you	2406	’ cried my aunt , shaking her head and her fist at the window . ‘
104852	104930	104846	104846	you	2406	’ My aunt was so exasperated by the coolness with which Miss Murdstone looked about her , that I really believe she was motionless , and unable for the moment to dart out according to custom . I seized the opportunity to inform her who it was ; and that the gentleman now coming near the offender ( for the way up was very steep , and he had dropped behind ) , was Mr. Murdstone himself . ‘
104939	104959	104960	104960	I	0	’ cried my aunt , still shaking her head and gesticulating anything but welcome from the bow - window . ‘
104986	105307	104976	104976	Janet	362	’ and I saw , from behind my aunt , a sort of hurried battle - piece , in which the donkey stood resisting everybody , with all his four legs planted different ways , while Janet tried to pull him round by the bridle , Mr. Murdstone tried to lead him on , Miss Murdstone struck at Janet with a parasol , and several boys , who had come to see the engagement , shouted vigorously . But my aunt , suddenly descrying among them the young malefactor who was the donkey ’s guardian , and who was one of the most inveterate offenders against her , though hardly in his teens , rushed out to the scene of action , pounced upon him , captured him , dragged him , with his jacket over his head , and his heels grinding the ground , into the garden , and , calling upon Janet to fetch the constables and justices , that he might be taken , tried , and executed on the spot , held him at bay there . This part of the business , however , did not last long ; for the young rascal , being expert at a variety of feints and dodges , of which my aunt had no conception , soon went whooping away , leaving some deep impressions of his nailed boots in the flower - beds , and taking his donkey in triumph with him . Miss Murdstone , during the latter portion of the contest , had dismounted , and was now waiting with her brother at the bottom of the steps , until my aunt should be at leisure to receive them . My aunt , a little ruffled by the combat , marched past them into the house , with great dignity , and took no notice of their presence , until they were announced by Janet . ‘
105315	105321	105313	105313	aunt	2261	’ I asked , trembling . ‘
105326	105331	105313	105313	aunt	2261	’ said my aunt . ‘
105335	105392	104976	104976	Janet	362	’ With which she pushed me into a corner near her , and fenced Me in with a chair , as if it were a prison or a bar of justice . This position I continued to occupy during the whole interview , and from it I now saw Mr. and Miss Murdstone enter the room . ‘
105395	105400	104976	104976	Janet	362	’ said my aunt , ‘
105442	105443	105433	105433	I	0	’ ‘
105452	105457	105444	105444	Your	0	’ said Miss Murdstone . ‘
105461	105480	105481	105482	Miss Trotwood	228	’ said my aunt . Mr. Murdstone seemed afraid of a renewal of hostilities , and interposing began : ‘
105484	105485	105481	105482	Miss Trotwood	228	’ ‘
105491	105500	105486	105486	I	0	’ observed my aunt with a keen look . ‘

105534	105539	105531	105531	I	0	’ said Mr. Murdstone . ‘
105548	105553	105555	105555	I	0	’ returned my aunt , ‘
105576	105577	105578	105578	I	0	’ ‘
105589	105596	105584	105585	Miss Trotwood	228	’ observed Miss Murdstone , bridling , ‘

105629	105634	105627	105627	ma’am	8495	’ said my aunt , ‘

105669	105688	105656	105656	nobody	732	’ returned Miss Murdstone , though , I thought , not with a very ready or gracious assent . ‘
105726	105727	105718	105718	I	0	’ ‘
105735	105740	105741	105741	Janet	362	’ said my aunt . ‘
105743	105748	105732	105732	you	979	’ ringing the bell , ‘
105762	105792	105793	105794	Mr. Dick	363	’ Until he came , my aunt sat perfectly upright and stiff , frowning at the wall . When he came , my aunt performed the ceremony of introduction . ‘
105806	105831	105832	105832	I	0	’ said my aunt , with emphasis , as an admonition to Mr. Dick , who was biting his forefinger and looking rather foolish , ‘
105835	105878	105832	105832	I	0	’ Mr. Dick took his finger out of his mouth , on this hint , and stood among the group , with a grave and attentive expression of face . My aunt inclined her head to Mr. Murdstone , who went on : ‘
105907	105908	105910	105910	you	0	’ ‘
105912	105922	105910	105910	you	0	’ said my aunt , still eyeing him keenly . ‘

105942	105947	105927	105927	me	0	’ pursued Mr. Murdstone , ‘

105972	105987	105953	105975	This unhappy boy who has run away from his friends and his occupation-- ’ ‘ And whose appearance , ’ interposed his sister	10597	’ interposed his sister , directing general attention to me in my indefinable costume , ‘
105994	105995	105996	105997	Jane Murdstone	279	’ ‘
105999	106004	105996	105997	Jane Murdstone	279	’ said her brother , ‘
106116	106117	106092	106093	my sister	1574	’ ‘
106133	106138	106124	106124	me	0	’ said Miss Murdstone ; ‘
106163	106164	106159	106161	the worst boy	2435	’ ‘
106167	106174	106159	106161	the worst boy	2435	’ said my aunt , shortly . ‘
106185	106190	106159	106161	the worst boy	2435	’ returned Miss Murdstone . ‘
106193	106198	106201	106201	sir	979	’ said my aunt . ‘
106203	106204	106201	106201	sir	979	’ ‘
106211	106239	106250	106250	they	2437	’ resumed Mr. Murdstone , whose face darkened more and more , the more he and my aunt observed each other , which they did very narrowly , ‘
106388	106389	106381	106381	your	2442	’ ‘
106397	106402	106381	106381	your	2442	’ said my aunt . ‘

106438	106446	106447	106447	his	9360	’ returned Miss Murdstone , striking in , ‘
106459	106460	106447	106447	his	9360	’ ‘
106487	106492	106485	106485	he	9360	’ said my aunt . ‘
106496	106508	106485	106485	he	9360	’ said Mr. Murdstone , with an inclination of his head , ‘
106529	106539	106485	106485	he	9360	’ Miss Murdstone confirmed this with an audible murmur . ‘
106542	106547	106548	106549	Unfortunate baby	2448	’ said my aunt . ‘
106551	106588	106548	106549	Unfortunate baby	2448	’ Mr. Dick , who had been rattling his money all this time , was rattling it so loudly now , that my aunt felt it necessary to check him with a look , before saying : ‘
106598	106599	106589	106591	The poor child	2445	’ ‘
106604	106609	106589	106591	The poor child	2445	’ replied Mr. Murdstone . ‘
106642	106643	106639	106640	her boy	2452	’ ‘
106658	106676	106654	106656	her first husband	2453	’ Mr. Murdstone began , when my aunt caught him up with the greatest irascibility and impatience . ‘
106752	106757	106739	106739	she	2445	’ said my aunt , ‘
106776	106777	106763	106764	no one	8485	’ ‘
106788	106793	106782	106782	her	2458	’ said Mr. Murdstone , ‘

106820	106831	106835	106835	she	2461	’ returned my aunt , shaking her head at him . ‘
106849	106850	106843	106843	you	963	’ ‘
106857	106861	106854	106855	Miss Trotwood	228	’ he returned . ‘
107077	107135	107064	107064	yours	228	’ To this address , my aunt had listened with the closest attention , sitting perfectly upright , with her hands folded on one knee , and looking grimly on the speaker . When he had finished , she turned her eyes so as to command Miss Murdstone , without otherwise disturbing her attitude , and said : ‘
107147	107148	107141	107141	YOU	8495	’ ‘
107154	107159	107151	107152	Miss Trotwood	228	’ said Miss Murdstone , ‘
107214	107241	107205	107205	your	8495	’ said Miss Murdstone ; with an irony which no more affected my aunt , than it discomposed the cannon I had slept by at Chatham . ‘
107249	107254	107245	107246	the boy	9042	’ said my aunt . ‘
107263	107389	107256	107256	you	8495	’ I answered no , and entreated her not to let me go . I said that neither Mr. nor Miss Murdstone had ever liked me , or had ever been kind to me . That they had made my mama , who always loved me dearly , unhappy about me , and that I knew it well , and that Peggotty knew it . I said that I had been more miserable than I thought anybody could believe , who only knew how young I was . And I begged and prayed my aunt -- I forget in what terms now , but I remember that they affected me very much then -- to befriend and protect me , for my father ’s sake . ‘
107393	107398	107256	107256	you	8495	’ said my aunt , ‘
107407	107419	107401	107401	I	0	’ Mr. Dick considered , hesitated , brightened , and rejoined , ‘

107435	107441	107432	107433	Mr. Dick	363	’ said my aunt triumphantly , ‘
107454	107473	107448	107448	your	363	’ Having shaken it with great cordiality , she pulled me towards her and said to Mr. Murdstone : ‘
107525	107526	107516	107516	I	0	’ ‘
107530	107543	107516	107516	I	0	’ rejoined Mr. Murdstone , shrugging his shoulders , as he rose , ‘
107549	107550	107545	107545	you	228	’ ‘
107557	107562	107545	107545	you	228	’ said my aunt . ‘

107575	107582	107545	107545	you	228	’ exclaimed Miss Murdstone , rising . ‘
107587	107588	107545	107545	you	228	’ ‘
107597	107628	107590	107590	you	363	’ said my aunt , turning a deaf ear to the sister , and continuing to address the brother , and to shake her head at him with infinite expression , ‘
107696	107697	107698	107698	I	0	’ ‘
107705	107710	107698	107698	I	0	’ said Miss Murdstone . ‘

107843	107848	107854	107855	this person	2478	’ said my aunt . ‘
107860	107865	107854	107855	this person	2478	’ exclaimed Miss Murdstone . ‘
107878	107951	107868	107868	you	363	’ said my aunt--‘God forgive me that I should call her so , and she gone where YOU wo n’t go in a hurry -- because you had not done wrong enough to her and hers , you must begin to train her , must you ? begin to break her , like a poor caged bird , and wear her deluded life away , in teaching her to sing YOUR notes ? ’
107952	107960	107962	107963	Miss Murdstone	278	‘ This is either insanity or intoxication , ’
107985	107995	107962	107963	Miss Murdstone	278	‘ and my suspicion is that it ’s intoxication . ’
108024	108028	108029	108029	she	228	‘ Mr. Murdstone , ’
108038	108117	108029	108029	she	228	‘ you were a tyrant to the simple baby , and you broke her heart . She was a loving baby -- I know that ; I knew it , years before you ever saw her -- and through the best part of her weakness you gave her the wounds she died of . There is the truth for your comfort , however you like it . And you and your instruments may make the most of it . ’
108118	108127	108129	108130	Miss Murdstone	278	‘ Allow me to inquire , Miss Trotwood , ’
108132	108157	108029	108029	she	228	‘ whom you are pleased to call , in a choice of words in which I am not experienced , my brother ’s instruments ? ’
108158	108254	108256	108257	my aunt	731	‘ It was clear enough , as I have told you , years before YOU ever saw her -- and why , in the mysterious dispensations of Providence , you ever did see her , is more than humanity can comprehend -- it was clear enough that the poor soft little thing would marry somebody , at some time or other ; but I did hope it would n’t have been as bad as it has turned out . That was the time , Mr. Murdstone , when she gave birth to her boy here , ’
108259	108294	108256	108257	my aunt	731	‘ to the poor child you sometimes tormented her through afterwards , which is a disagreeable remembrance and makes the sight of him odious now . Aye , aye ! you need n’t wince ! ’
108299	108308	108309	108309	He	2483	‘ I know it ’s true without that . ’

108384	108399	108381	108382	my aunt	731	‘ and good - bye ! Good day to you , too , ma’am , ’
108410	108447	108381	108382	my aunt	731	‘ Let me see you ride a donkey over my green again , and as sure as you have a head upon your shoulders , I ’ll knock your bonnet off , and tread upon it ! ’
108641	108659	108661	108662	my aunt	731	‘ You ’ll consider yourself guardian , jointly with me , of this child , Mr. Dick , ’
108664	108670	108672	108673	Mr. Dick	363	‘ I shall be delighted , ’
108675	108685	108672	108673	Mr. Dick	363	‘ to be the guardian of David ’s son . ’
108686	108690	108692	108693	my aunt	731	‘ Very good , ’
108695	108719	108692	108693	my aunt	731	‘ that ’s settled . I have been thinking , do you know , Mr. Dick , that I might call him Trotwood ? ’
108720	108731	108733	108734	Mr. Dick	363	‘ Certainly , certainly . Call him Trotwood , certainly , ’
108736	108743	108733	108734	Mr. Dick	363	‘ David ’s son ’s Trotwood . ’
108744	108751	108753	108754	my aunt	731	‘ Trotwood Copperfield , you mean , ’
108756	108768	108770	108771	Mr. Dick	363	‘ Yes , to be sure . Yes . Trotwood Copperfield , ’
108803	108806	108809	108809	her	731	‘ Trotwood Copperfield ’
109657	109660	109662	109663	my aunt	731	‘ Trot , ’
109682	109690	109662	109663	my aunt	731	‘ we must not forget your education . ’
109710	109721	109723	109724	my aunt	731	‘ Should you like to go to school at Canterbury ? ’
109743	109746	109748	109749	my aunt	731	‘ Good , ’
109751	109759	109748	109749	my aunt	731	‘ Should you like to go tomorrow ? ’
109788	109791	109774	109774	I	0	‘ Yes . ’
109792	109795	109797	109798	my aunt	731	‘ Good , ’
109801	109825	109797	109798	my aunt	731	‘ Janet , hire the grey pony and chaise tomorrow morning at ten o’clock , and pack up Master Trotwood ’s clothes tonight . ’
110144	110154	110155	110155	I	0	‘ Very happy indeed , thank you , aunt , ’
110179	110188	110189	110189	I	0	‘ Is it a large school , aunt ? ’
110192	110200	110202	110203	my aunt	731	‘ Why , I do n’t know , ’
110205	110215	110202	110203	my aunt	731	‘ We are going to Mr. Wickfield ’s first . ’
110216	110223	110224	110224	I	0	‘ Does he keep a school ? ’
110227	110232	110234	110235	my aunt	731	‘ No , Trot , ’
110237	110243	110244	110244	I	0	‘ He keeps an office . ’
110765	110775	110777	110778	my aunt	731	‘ Is Mr. Wickfield at home , Uriah Heep ? ’
110780	110789	110791	110792	Uriah Heep	373	‘ Mr. Wickfield ’s at home , ma’am , ’
110794	111036	110791	110792	Uriah Heep	373	‘ if you ’ll please to walk in there’--pointing with his long hand to the room he meant . We got out ; and leaving him to hold the pony , went into a long low parlour looking towards the street , from the window of which I caught a glimpse , as I went in , of Uriah Heep breathing into the pony ’s nostrils , and immediately covering them with his hand , as if he were putting some spell upon him . Opposite to the tall old chimney - piece were two portraits : one of a gentleman with grey hair ( though not by any means an old man ) and black eyebrows , who was looking over some papers tied together with red tape ; the other , of a lady , with a very placid and sweet expression of face , who was looking at me . I believe I was turning about in search of Uriah ’s picture , when , a door at the farther end of the room opening , a gentleman entered , at sight of whom I turned to the first - mentioned portrait again , to make quite sure that it had not come out of its frame . But it was stationary ; and as the gentleman advanced into the light , I saw that he was some years older than when he had had his picture painted . ‘
111041	111046	111037	111039	Miss Betsey Trotwood	228	’ said the gentleman , ‘
111078	111153	111071	111071	I	0	’ Miss Betsey thanked him , and we went into his room , which was furnished as an office , with books , papers , tin boxes , and so forth . It looked into a garden , and had an iron safe let into the wall ; so immediately over the mantelshelf , that I wondered , as I sat down , how the sweeps got round it when they swept the chimney . ‘
111159	111193	111156	111157	Miss Trotwood	228	’ said Mr. Wickfield ; for I soon found that it was he , and that he was a lawyer , and steward of the estates of a rich gentleman of the county ; ‘
111208	111209	111205	111205	I	0	’ ‘
111212	111217	111205	111205	I	0	’ replied my aunt . ‘

111234	111239	111218	111218	I	0	’ said Mr. Wickfield . ‘
111248	111377	111240	111240	You	8495	’ His hair was quite white now , though his eyebrows were still black . He had a very agreeable face , and , I thought , was handsome . There was a certain richness in his complexion , which I had been long accustomed , under Peggotty ’s tuition , to connect with port wine ; and I fancied it was in his voice too , and referred his growing corpulency to the same cause . He was very cleanly dressed , in a blue coat , striped waistcoat , and nankeen trousers ; and his fine frilled shirt and cambric neckcloth looked unusually soft and white , reminding my strolling fancy ( I call to mind ) of the plumage on the breast of a swan . ‘
111383	111388	111380	111381	my nephew	2555	’ said my aunt . ‘
111399	111404	111396	111397	Miss Trotwood	228	’ said Mr. Wickfield . ‘
111415	111420	111405	111408	My grand - nephew	2556	’ observed my aunt . ‘
111437	111442	111431	111431	I	0	’ said Mr. Wickfield . ‘
111448	111473	111443	111443	I	0	’ said my aunt , with a wave of her hand , importing that his knowledge and his ignorance were all one to her , ‘
111516	111517	111500	111500	me	0	’ ‘
111525	111542	111500	111500	me	0	’ said Mr. Wickfield--‘the old question , you know . What ’s your motive in this ? ’
111543	111549	111551	111552	my aunt	731	‘ Deuce take the man ! ’
111554	111562	111500	111500	me	0	‘ Always fishing for motives , when they ’re

111589	111601	111586	111586	I	0	’ said Mr. Wickfield , shaking his head and smiling incredulously . ‘
111606	111611	111586	111586	I	0	’ returned my aunt . ‘
111644	111645	111634	111634	you	8495	’ ‘
111660	111666	111649	111649	I	0	’ he rejoined , smiling . ‘
111707	111713	111702	111702	you	8495	’ My aunt nodded assent . ‘
111720	111727	111702	111702	you	8495	’ said Mr. Wickfield , considering , ‘
111736	111737	111728	111729	your nephew	2263	’ ‘
111748	111828	111745	111745	I	0	’ suggested my aunt . Mr. Wickfield thought I could . After a little discussion , he proposed to take my aunt to the school , that she might see it and judge for herself ; also , to take her , with the same object , to two or three houses where he thought I could be boarded . My aunt embracing the proposal , we were all three going out together , when he stopped and said : ‘
111855	112215	111846	111846	I	0	’ My aunt seemed disposed to contest the point ; but to facilitate matters I said I would gladly remain behind , if they pleased ; and returned into Mr. Wickfield ’s office , where I sat down again , in the chair I had first occupied , to await their return . It so happened that this chair was opposite a narrow passage , which ended in the little circular room where I had seen Uriah Heep ’s pale face looking out of the window . Uriah , having taken the pony to a neighbouring stable , was at work at a desk in this room , which had a brass frame on the top to hang paper upon , and on which the writing he was making a copy of was then hanging . Though his face was towards me , I thought , for some time , the writing being between us , that he could not see me ; but looking that way more attentively , it made me uncomfortable to observe that , every now and then , his sleepless eyes would come below the writing , like two red suns , and stealthily stare at me for I dare say a whole minute at a time , during which his pen went , or pretended to go , as cleverly as ever . I made several attempts to get out of their way -- such as standing on a chair to look at a map on the other side of the room , and poring over the columns of a Kentish newspaper -- but they always attracted me back again ; and whenever I looked towards those two red suns , I was sure to find them , either just rising or just setting . At length , much to my relief , my aunt and Mr. Wickfield came back , after a pretty long absence . They were not so successful as I could have wished ; for though the advantages of the school were undeniable , my aunt had not approved of any of the boarding - houses proposed for me . ‘
112221	112226	111846	111846	I	0	’ said my aunt . ‘
112237	112238	112235	112235	Trot	370	’ ‘
112244	112249	112235	112235	Trot	370	’ said Mr. Wickfield . ‘
112263	112264	112260	112261	Miss Trotwood	228	’ ‘
112269	112274	112260	112261	Miss Trotwood	228	’ inquired my aunt . ‘
112321	112340	112343	112344	Miss Trotwood	228	’ My aunt evidently liked the offer , though she was delicate of accepting it . So did I. ‘
112346	112351	112343	112344	Miss Trotwood	228	’ said Mr. Wickfield . ‘
112425	112426	112413	112413	You	228	’ ‘
112435	112440	112427	112427	I	0	’ said my aunt ; ‘
112450	112451	112457	112457	you	228	’ ‘
112460	112465	112454	112454	I	0	’ cried Mr. Wickfield . ‘
112506	112507	112503	112503	you	228	’ ‘
112512	112517	112503	112503	you	228	’ said my aunt , ‘
112536	112537	112527	112527	I	0	’ ‘
112546	113235	112542	112544	my little housekeeper	2580	’ said Mr. Wickfield . We accordingly went up a wonderful old staircase ; with a balustrade so broad that we might have gone up that , almost as easily ; and into a shady old drawing - room , lighted by some three or four of the quaint windows I had looked up at from the street : which had old oak seats in them , that seemed to have come of the same trees as the shining oak floor , and the great beams in the ceiling . It was a prettily furnished room , with a piano and some lively furniture in red and green , and some flowers . It seemed to be all old nooks and corners ; and in every nook and corner there was some queer little table , or cupboard , or bookcase , or seat , or something or other , that made me think there was not such another good corner in the room ; until I looked at the next one , and found it equal to it , if not better . On everything there was the same air of retirement and cleanliness that marked the house outside . Mr. Wickfield tapped at a door in a corner of the panelled wall , and a girl of about my own age came quickly out and kissed him . On her face , I saw immediately the placid and sweet expression of the lady whose picture had looked at me downstairs . It seemed to my imagination as if the portrait had grown womanly , and the original remained a child . Although her face was quite bright and happy , there was a tranquillity about it , and about her -- a quiet , good , calm spirit -- that I never have forgotten ; that I shall never forget . This was his little housekeeper , his daughter Agnes , Mr. Wickfield said . When I heard how he said it , and saw how he held her hand , I guessed what the one motive of his life was . She had a little basket - trifle hanging at her side , with keys in it ; and she looked as staid and as discreet a housekeeper as the old house could have . She listened to her father as he told her about me , with a pleasant face ; and when he had concluded , proposed to my aunt that we should go upstairs and see my room . We all went together , she before us : and a glorious old room it was , with more oak beams , and diamond panes ; and the broad balustrade going all the way up to it . I can not call to mind where or when , in my childhood , I had seen a stained glass window in a church . Nor do I recollect its subject . But I know that when I saw her turn round , in the grave light of the old staircase , and wait for us , above , I thought of that window ; and I associated something of its tranquil brightness with Agnes Wickfield ever afterwards . My aunt was as happy as I was , in the arrangement made for me ; and we went down to the drawing - room again , well pleased and gratified . As she would not hear of staying to dinner , lest she should by any chance fail to arrive at home with the grey pony before dark ; and as I apprehend Mr. Wickfield knew her too well to argue any point with her ; some lunch was provided for her there , and Agnes went back to her governess , and Mr. Wickfield to his office . So we were left to take leave of one another without any restraint . She told me that everything would be arranged for me by Mr. Wickfield , and that I should want for nothing , and gave me the kindest words and the best advice . ‘
113238	113245	113250	113250	yourself	2581	’ said my aunt in conclusion , ‘
113265	113289	113263	113263	you	2581	’ I was greatly overcome , and could only thank her , again and again , and send my love to Mr. Dick . ‘
113292	113297	113263	113263	you	2581	’ said my aunt , ‘
113327	113349	113319	113319	I	0	’ I promised , as well as I could , that I would not abuse her kindness or forget her admonition . ‘
113357	113362	113319	113319	I	0	’ said my aunt , ‘
113371	114341	114342	114343	Mrs. Strong	377	’ With these words she embraced me hastily , and went out of the room , shutting the door after her . At first I was startled by so abrupt a departure , and almost feared I had displeased her ; but when I looked into the street , and saw how dejectedly she got into the chaise , and drove away without looking up , I understood her better and did not do her that injustice . By five o’clock , which was Mr. Wickfield ’s dinner - hour , I had mustered up my spirits again , and was ready for my knife and fork . The cloth was only laid for us two ; but Agnes was waiting in the drawing - room before dinner , went down with her father , and sat opposite to him at table . I doubted whether he could have dined without her . We did not stay there , after dinner , but came upstairs into the drawing - room again : in one snug corner of which , Agnes set glasses for her father , and a decanter of port wine . I thought he would have missed its usual flavour , if it had been put there for him by any other hands . There he sat , taking his wine , and taking a good deal of it , for two hours ; while Agnes played on the piano , worked , and talked to him and me . He was , for the most part , gay and cheerful with us ; but sometimes his eyes rested on her , and he fell into a brooding state , and was silent . She always observed this quickly , I thought , and always roused him with a question or caress . Then he came out of his meditation , and drank more wine . Agnes made the tea , and presided over it ; and the time passed away after it , as after dinner , until she went to bed ; when her father took her in his arms and kissed her , and , she being gone , ordered candles in his office . Then I went to bed too . But in the course of the evening I had rambled down to the door , and a little way along the street , that I might have another peep at the old houses , and the grey Cathedral ; and might think of my coming through that old city on my journey , and of my passing the very house I lived in , without knowing it . As I came back , I saw Uriah Heep shutting up the office ; and feeling friendly towards everybody , went in and spoke to him , and at parting , gave him my hand . But oh , what a clammy hand his was ! as ghostly to the touch as to the sight ! I rubbed mine afterwards , to warm it , AND TO RUB HIS OFF . It was such an uncomfortable hand , that , when I went to my room , it was still cold and wet upon my memory . Leaning out of the window , and seeing one of the faces on the beam - ends looking at me sideways , I fancied it was Uriah Heep got up there somehow , and shut him out in a hurry . CHAPTER 16 . I AM A NEW BOY IN MORE SENSES THAN ONE Next morning , after breakfast , I entered on school life again . I went , accompanied by Mr. Wickfield , to the scene of my future studies -- a grave building in a courtyard , with a learned air about it that seemed very well suited to the stray rooks and jackdaws who came down from the Cathedral towers to walk with a clerkly bearing on the grass - plot -- and was introduced to my new master , Doctor Strong . Doctor Strong looked almost as rusty , to my thinking , as the tall iron rails and gates outside the house ; and almost as stiff and heavy as the great stone urns that flanked them , and were set up , on the top of the red - brick wall , at regular distances all round the court , like sublimated skittles , for Time to play at . He was in his library ( I mean Doctor Strong was ) , with his clothes not particularly well brushed , and his hair not particularly well combed ; his knee - smalls unbraced ; his long black gaiters unbuttoned ; and his shoes yawning like two caverns on the hearth - rug . Turning upon me a lustreless eye , that reminded me of a long - forgotten blind old horse who once used to crop the grass , and tumble over the graves , in Blunderstone churchyard , he said he was glad to see me : and then he gave me his hand ; which I did n’t know what to do with , as it did nothing for itself . But , sitting at work , not far from Doctor Strong , was a very pretty young lady -- whom he called Annie , and who was his daughter , I supposed -- who got me out of my difficulty by kneeling down to put Doctor Strong ’s shoes on , and button his gaiters , which she did with great cheerfulness and quickness . When she had finished , and we were going out to the schoolroom , I was much surprised to hear Mr. Wickfield , in bidding her good morning , address her as ‘
114344	114376	114342	114343	Mrs. Strong	377	’ ; and I was wondering could she be Doctor Strong ’s son ’s wife , or could she be Mrs. Doctor Strong , when Doctor Strong himself unconsciously enlightened me . ‘
114383	114398	114399	114399	you	372	’ he said , stopping in a passage with his hand on my shoulder ; ‘
114413	114414	114399	114399	you	372	’ ‘
114417	114422	114399	114399	you	372	’ said Mr. Wickfield . ‘

114445	114450	114443	114443	Wickfield	372	’ said Doctor Strong , ‘
114478	114497	114474	114475	Doctor Watts	378	’ he added , looking at me , and moving his head to the time of his quotation , ‘
114512	114513	114516	114516	Doctor	834	’ ‘
114518	114523	114516	114516	Doctor	834	’ returned Mr. Wickfield , ‘

114618	114628	114615	114615	I	0	’ said Doctor Strong , rubbing his chin thoughtfully . ‘
114632	114637	114639	114639	you	0	’ said Mr. Wickfield ; ‘
114671	114679	114668	114668	I	0	’ he said this with some hesitation , ‘

114698	114703	114695	114695	My	0	’ returned Doctor Strong , ‘

114745	114760	114727	114727	I	0	’ replied the Doctor , apparently wondering why he emphasized those words so much . ‘

114811	114816	114807	114807	you	0	’ asked Mr. Wickfield . ‘

114827	114831	114768	114768	Your	0	’ with astonishment . ‘

114881	114886	114879	114879	you	0	’ said Mr. Wickfield . ‘
114911	114984	114904	114904	I	0	’ Doctor Strong regarded him with a puzzled and doubting look , which almost immediately subsided into a smile that gave me great encouragement ; for it was full of amiability and sweetness , and there was a simplicity in it , and indeed in his whole manner , when the studious , pondering frost upon it was got through , very attractive and hopeful to a young scholar like me . Repeating ‘
114986	114989	114879	114879	you	0	’ , and ‘
114993	115190	114879	114879	you	0	’ , and other short assurances to the same purport , Doctor Strong jogged on before us , at a queer , uneven pace ; and we followed : Mr. Wickfield , looking grave , I observed , and shaking his head to himself , without knowing that I saw him . The schoolroom was a pretty large hall , on the quietest side of the house , confronted by the stately stare of some half - dozen of the great urns , and commanding a peep of an old secluded garden belonging to the Doctor , where the peaches were ripening on the sunny south wall . There were two great aloes , in tubs , on the turf outside the windows ; the broad hard leaves of which plant ( looking as if they were made of painted tin ) have ever since , by association , been symbolical to me of silence and retirement . About five - and - twenty boys were studiously engaged at their books when we went in , but they rose to give the Doctor good morning , and remained standing when they saw Mr. Wickfield and me . ‘
115198	115203	114879	114879	you	0	’ said the Doctor ; ‘
115207	115928	115204	115205	Trotwood Copperfield	232	’ One Adams , who was the head - boy , then stepped out of his place and welcomed me . He looked like a young clergyman , in his white cravat , but he was very affable and good - humoured ; and he showed me my place , and presented me to the masters , in a gentlemanly way that would have put me at my ease , if anything could . It seemed to me so long , however , since I had been among such boys , or among any companions of my own age , except Mick Walker and Mealy Potatoes , that I felt as strange as ever I have done in my life . I was so conscious of having passed through scenes of which they could have no knowledge , and of having acquired experiences foreign to my age , appearance , and condition as one of them , that I half believed it was an imposture to come there as an ordinary little schoolboy . I had become , in the Murdstone and Grinby time , however short or long it may have been , so unused to the sports and games of boys , that I knew I was awkward and inexperienced in the commonest things belonging to them . Whatever I had learnt , had so slipped away from me in the sordid cares of my life from day to night , that now , when I was examined about what I knew , I knew nothing , and was put into the lowest form of the school . But , troubled as I was , by my want of boyish skill , and of book - learning too , I was made infinitely more uncomfortable by the consideration , that , in what I did know , I was much farther removed from my companions than in what I did not . My mind ran upon what they would think , if they knew of my familiar acquaintance with the King ’s Bench Prison ? Was there anything about me which would reveal my proceedings in connexion with the Micawber family -- all those pawnings , and sellings , and suppers -- in spite of myself ? Suppose some of the boys had seen me coming through Canterbury , wayworn and ragged , and should find me out ? What would they say , who made so light of money , if they could know how I had scraped my halfpence together , for the purchase of my daily saveloy and beer , or my slices of pudding ? How would it affect them , who were so innocent of London life , and London streets , to discover how knowing I was ( and was ashamed to be ) in some of the meanest phases of both ? All this ran in my head so much , on that first day at Doctor Strong ’s , that I felt distrustful of my slightest look and gesture ; shrunk within myself whensoever I was approached by one of my new schoolfellows ; and hurried off the minute school was over , afraid of committing myself in my response to any friendly notice or advance . But there was such an influence in Mr. Wickfield ’s old house , that when I knocked at it , with my new school - books under my arm , I began to feel my uneasiness softening away . As I went up to my airy old room , the grave shadow of the staircase seemed to fall upon my doubts and fears , and to make the past more indistinct . I sat there , sturdily conning my books , until dinner - time ( we were out of school for good at three ) ; and went down , hopeful of becoming a passable sort of boy yet . Agnes was in the drawing - room , waiting for her father , who was detained by someone in his office . She met me with her pleasant smile , and asked me how I liked the school . I told her I should like it very much , I hoped ; but I was a little strange to it at first . ‘
115936	115940	115942	115942	you	2599	’ I said , ‘
115944	115945	115942	115942	you	2599	’ ‘
115952	115953	115942	115942	you	2599	’ ‘
115966	115967	115957	115957	you	2599	’ ‘
115978	115988	115968	115968	Papa	381	’ she answered , smiling and shaking her head . ‘
116000	116001	115997	115997	you	2599	’ ‘
116013	116019	116002	116002	He	381	’ I said . She nodded ‘
116022	116057	116002	116002	He	381	’ and went to the door to listen for his coming up , that she might meet him on the stairs . But , as he was not there , she came back again . ‘
116068	116077	116058	116058	Mama	382	’ she said , in her quiet way . ‘
116101	116114	116115	116115	Papa	381	’ I told her yes , because it was so like herself . ‘
116121	116127	116115	116115	Papa	381	’ said Agnes , pleased . ‘
116135	116187	116132	116132	papa	2049	’ Her bright calm face lighted up with pleasure as she went to meet him , and as they came in , hand in hand . He greeted me cordially ; and told me I should certainly be happy under Doctor Strong , who was one of the gentlest of men . ‘
116208	116213	116132	116132	papa	2049	’ said Mr. Wickfield . ‘
116261	116334	116254	116255	the Doctor	838	’ He spoke , I thought , as if he were weary , or dissatisfied with something ; but I did not pursue the question in my mind , for dinner was just then announced , and we went down and took the same seats as before . We had scarcely done so , when Uriah Heep put in his red head and his lank hand at the door , and said : ‘
116348	116349	116346	116346	sir	979	’ ‘
116360	116365	116357	116358	Mr. Maldon	348	’ said his master . ‘
116370	116374	116368	116368	sir	979	’ returned Uriah ; ‘
116391	116459	116383	116383	he	348	’ As he held the door open with his hand , Uriah looked at me , and looked at Agnes , and looked at the dishes , and looked at the plates , and looked at every object in the room , I thought,--yet seemed to look at nothing ; he made such an appearance all the while of keeping his red eyes dutifully on his master . ‘
116474	116552	116462	116462	your	979	’ observed a voice behind Uriah , as Uriah ’s head was pushed away , and the speaker ’s substituted--‘pray excuse me for this intrusion -- that as it seems I have no choice in the matter , the sooner I go abroad the better . My cousin Annie did say , when we talked of it , that she liked to have her friends within reach rather than to have them banished , and the old Doctor-- ’
116553	116560	116561	116562	Mr. Wickfield	372	‘ Doctor Strong , was that ? ’
116567	116574	116576	116577	the other	2611	‘ Doctor Strong , of course , ’
116579	116596	116576	116577	the other	2611	‘ I call him the old Doctor ; it ’s all the same , you know . ’
116597	116603	116605	116606	Mr. Wickfield	372	‘ I do n’t know , ’
116608	116614	116616	116618	the other--‘Doctor Strong	377	‘ Well , Doctor Strong , ’
116706	116707	116736	116736	Thank’ee	383	’ ‘
116730	116735	116721	116722	Mr. Maldon	348	’ said Mr. Wickfield . ‘
116738	116743	116736	116736	Thank’ee	383	’ said the other . ‘
116800	116801	116790	116790	Annie	318	’ ‘
116820	116825	116804	116805	Mrs. Strong	377	’ said Mr. Wickfield . ‘
116829	116834	116804	116805	Mrs. Strong	377	’ returned the other , ‘
116869	116870	116842	116842	she	377	’ ‘
116882	116892	116879	116880	Mr. Maldon	348	’ asked Mr. Wickfield , sedately eating his dinner . ‘
116922	116930	116917	116920	a charming young boy	2619	’ said Mr. Jack Maldon , laughing . ‘
116957	116958	116964	116964	sir	979	’ ‘
116966	116972	116964	116964	sir	979	’ asked Mr. Wickfield gravely . ‘
116979	117026	116977	116977	sir	979	’ Mr. Jack Maldon answered , laughing . But appearing to remark that Mr. Wickfield went on with his dinner in the same sedate , immovable manner , and that there was no hope of making him relax a muscle of his face , he added : ‘
117089	117090	117055	117055	I	0	’ ‘
117095	117110	117111	117111	Thank’ee	383	’ asked Mr. Wickfield , with a motion of his hand towards the table . ‘
117119	117124	117113	117113	I	0	’ said Mr. Maldon , ‘
117134	117503	117128	117128	Annie	318	’ Mr. Wickfield , without rising , looked after him thoughtfully as he went out . He was rather a shallow sort of young gentleman , I thought , with a handsome face , a rapid utterance , and a confident , bold air . And this was the first I ever saw of Mr. Jack Maldon ; whom I had not expected to see so soon , when I heard the Doctor speak of him that morning . When we had dined , we went upstairs again , where everything went on exactly as on the previous day . Agnes set the glasses and decanters in the same corner , and Mr. Wickfield sat down to drink , and drank a good deal . Agnes played the piano to him , sat by him , and worked and talked , and played some games at dominoes with me . In good time she made tea ; and afterwards , when I brought down my books , looked into them , and showed me what she knew of them ( which was no slight matter , though she said it was ) , and what was the best way to learn and understand them . I see her , with her modest , orderly , placid manner , and I hear her beautiful calm voice , as I write these words . The influence for all good , which she came to exercise over me at a later time , begins already to descend upon my breast . I love little Em’ly , and I do n’t love Agnes -- no , not at all in that way -- but I feel that there are goodness , peace , and truth , wherever Agnes is ; and that the soft light of the coloured window in the church , seen long ago , falls on her always , and on me when I am near her , and on everything around . The time having come for her withdrawal for the night , and she having left us , I gave Mr. Wickfield my hand , preparatory to going away myself . But he checked me and said : ‘
117519	117520	117128	117128	Annie	318	’ ‘
117524	117530	117128	117128	Annie	318	’ I answered , quickly . ‘
117535	117536	117538	117538	you	2628	’ ‘
117545	117546	117542	117542	I	0	’ ‘
117566	117570	117562	117562	I	0	’ he said . ‘
117586	117587	117589	117589	Agnes	376	’ ‘
117591	117609	117589	117589	Agnes	376	’ he repeated , walking slowly to the great chimney - piece , and leaning against it . ‘
117613	117663	117611	117611	Agnes	376	’ He had drank wine that evening ( or I fancied it ) , until his eyes were bloodshot . Not that I could see them now , for they were cast down , and shaded by his hand ; but I had noticed them a little while before . ‘
117668	117672	117675	117675	Agnes	376	’ he muttered , ‘
117698	117713	117733	117733	her	376	’ He was musing , not speaking to me ; so I remained quiet . ‘
117719	117723	117733	117733	her	376	’ he said , ‘
117784	117825	117834	117834	she	376	’ He did not supply the word ; but pacing slowly to the place where he had sat , and mechanically going through the action of pouring wine from the empty decanter , set it down and paced back again . ‘
117838	117842	117834	117834	she	376	’ he said , ‘
117864	117926	117858	117858	I	0	’ He leaned against the chimney - piece , brooding so long that I could not decide whether to run the risk of disturbing him by going , or to remain quietly where I was , until he should come out of his reverie . At length he aroused himself , and looked about the room until his eyes encountered mine . ‘
117935	117955	117858	117858	I	0	’ he said in his usual manner , and as if he were answering something I had just said . ‘
117992	117993	117994	117994	I	0	’ ‘
118004	118008	118002	118002	sir	979	’ I said . ‘
118017	118018	118009	118009	I	0	’ ‘
118025	118030	118009	118009	I	0	’ said Mr. Wickfield . ‘
118046	118248	118249	118249	You	2642	’ He shook hands with me upon it , and clapped me on the back ; and told me that when I had anything to do at night after Agnes had left us , or when I wished to read for my own pleasure , I was free to come down to his room , if he were there and if I desired it for company ’s sake , and to sit with him . I thanked him for his consideration ; and , as he went down soon afterwards , and I was not tired , went down too , with a book in my hand , to avail myself , for half - an - hour , of his permission . But , seeing a light in the little round office , and immediately feeling myself attracted towards Uriah Heep , who had a sort of fascination for me , I went in there instead . I found Uriah reading a great fat book , with such demonstrative attention , that his lank forefinger followed up every line as he read , and made clammy tracks along the page ( or so I fully believed ) like a snail . ‘
118257	118260	118255	118255	Uriah	373	’ says I. ‘
118266	118328	118263	118264	Master Copperfield	232	’ says Uriah . As I was getting on the stool opposite , to talk to him more conveniently , I observed that he had not such a thing as a smile about him , and that he could only widen his mouth and make two hard creases down his cheeks , one on each side , to stand for one . ‘
118340	118344	118337	118338	Master Copperfield	232	’ said Uriah . ‘
118350	118354	118355	118355	I	0	’ I asked . ‘
118365	118369	118362	118363	Master Copperfield	232	’ said Uriah . ‘
118390	118471	118387	118388	Master Copperfield	232	’ My stool was such a tower of observation , that as I watched him reading on again , after this rapturous exclamation , and following up the lines with his forefinger , I observed that his nostrils , which were thin and pointed , with sharp dints in them , had a singular and most uncomfortable way of expanding and contracting themselves -- that they seemed to twinkle instead of his eyes , which hardly ever twinkled at all . ‘
118481	118493	118494	118494	Me	0	’ I said , after looking at him for some time . ‘
118499	118503	118496	118497	Master Copperfield	232	’ said Uriah . ‘
118509	118515	118508	118508	I	0	’m a very umble person . ’
118563	118576	118578	118579	Uriah Heep	373	‘ I am well aware that I am the umblest person going , ’
118583	118632	118578	118579	Uriah Heep	373	‘ let the other be where he may . My mother is likewise a very umble person . We live in a numble abode , Master Copperfield , but have much to be thankful for . My father ’s former calling was umble . He was a sexton . ’
118633	118639	118640	118640	I	0	‘ What is he now ? ’
118643	118656	118658	118659	Uriah Heep	373	‘ He is a partaker of glory at present , Master Copperfield , ’
118661	118685	118686	118686	I	0	‘ But we have much to be thankful for . How much have I to be thankful for in living with Mr. Wickfield ! ’
118698	118713	118715	118715	Uriah	373	‘ I have been with him , going on four year , Master Copperfield , ’
118733	118790	118715	118715	Uriah	373	‘ Since a year after my father ’s death . How much have I to be thankful for , in that ! How much have I to be thankful for , in Mr. Wickfield ’s kind intention to give me my articles , which would otherwise not lay within the umble means of mother and self ! ’
118791	118811	118813	118813	I.	373	‘ Then , when your articled time is over , you ’ll be a regular lawyer , I suppose ? ’
118814	118824	118826	118826	Uriah	373	‘ With the blessing of Providence , Master Copperfield , ’
118828	118846	118847	118847	I	0	‘ Perhaps you ’ll be a partner in Mr. Wickfield ’s business , one of these days , ’
118855	118869	118847	118847	I	0	‘ and it will be Wickfield and Heep , or Heep late Wickfield . ’
118870	118877	118879	118879	Uriah	373	‘ Oh no , Master Copperfield , ’
118885	118894	118882	118882	his	373	‘ I am much too umble for that ! ’
118935	118947	118949	118949	Uriah	373	‘ Mr. Wickfield is a most excellent man , Master Copperfield , ’
118951	118975	118949	118949	Uriah	373	‘ If you have known him long , you know it , I am sure , much better than I can inform you . ’
119005	119013	119015	119015	Uriah	373	‘ Oh , indeed , Master Copperfield , ’
119017	119028	119015	119015	Uriah	373	‘ Your aunt is a sweet lady , Master Copperfield ! ’
119071	119079	119081	119082	Uriah Heep	373	‘ A sweet lady , Master Copperfield ! ’
119084	119100	119101	119101	I	0	‘ She has a great admiration for Miss Agnes , Master Copperfield , I believe ? ’
119104	119107	119101	119101	I	0	‘ Yes , ’
119122	119133	119135	119135	Uriah	373	‘ I hope you have , too , Master Copperfield , ’
119137	119146	119135	119135	Uriah	373	‘ But I am sure you must have . ’
119147	119152	119153	119153	I	0	‘ Everybody must have , ’
119156	119165	119167	119168	Uriah Heep	373	‘ Oh , thank you , Master Copperfield , ’
119170	119200	119201	119201	He	373	‘ for that remark ! It is so true ! Umble as I am , I know it is so true ! Oh , thank you , Master Copperfield ! ’
119228	119235	119236	119236	he	373	‘ Mother will be expecting me , ’
119252	119310	119311	119311	I	0	‘ and getting uneasy ; for though we are very umble , Master Copperfield , we are much attached to one another . If you would come and see us , any afternoon , and take a cup of tea at our lowly dwelling , mother would be as proud of your company as I should be . ’
119320	119327	119329	119329	Uriah	373	‘ Thank you , Master Copperfield , ’
119349	119372	119339	119339	you	373	’ I said I was going to be brought up there , I believed , as long as I remained at school . ‘
119377	119381	119339	119339	you	373	’ exclaimed Uriah . ‘
119397	119433	119385	119385	YOU	373	’ I protested that I had no views of that sort , and that no such scheme was entertained in my behalf by anybody ; but Uriah insisted on blandly replying to all my assurances , ‘
119449	119452	119441	119441	I	0	’ and , ‘
119468	119508	119460	119460	I	0	’ over and over again . Being , at last , ready to leave the office for the night , he asked me if it would suit my convenience to have the light put out ; and on my answering ‘
119511	119632	119460	119460	I	0	’ instantly extinguished it . After shaking hands with me -- his hand felt like a fish , in the dark -- he opened the door into the street a very little , and crept out , and shut it , leaving me to grope my way back into the house : which cost me some trouble and a fall over his stool . This was the proximate cause , I suppose , of my dreaming about him , for what appeared to me to be half the night ; and dreaming , among other things , that he had launched Mr. Peggotty ’s house on a piratical expedition , with a black flag at the masthead , bearing the inscription ‘
119636	121409	121410	121410	I	0	’ , under which diabolical ensign he was carrying me and little Em’ly to the Spanish Main , to be drowned . I got a little the better of my uneasiness when I went to school next day , and a good deal the better next day , and so shook it off by degrees , that in less than a fortnight I was quite at home , and happy , among my new companions . I was awkward enough in their games , and backward enough in their studies ; but custom would improve me in the first respect , I hoped , and hard work in the second . Accordingly , I went to work very hard , both in play and in earnest , and gained great commendation . And , in a very little while , the Murdstone and Grinby life became so strange to me that I hardly believed in it , while my present life grew so familiar , that I seemed to have been leading it a long time . Doctor Strong ’s was an excellent school ; as different from Mr. Creakle ’s as good is from evil . It was very gravely and decorously ordered , and on a sound system ; with an appeal , in everything , to the honour and good faith of the boys , and an avowed intention to rely on their possession of those qualities unless they proved themselves unworthy of it , which worked wonders . We all felt that we had a part in the management of the place , and in sustaining its character and dignity . Hence , we soon became warmly attached to it -- I am sure I did for one , and I never knew , in all my time , of any other boy being otherwise -- and learnt with a good will , desiring to do it credit . We had noble games out of hours , and plenty of liberty ; but even then , as I remember , we were well spoken of in the town , and rarely did any disgrace , by our appearance or manner , to the reputation of Doctor Strong and Doctor Strong ’s boys . Some of the higher scholars boarded in the Doctor ’s house , and through them I learned , at second hand , some particulars of the Doctor ’s history -- as , how he had not yet been married twelve months to the beautiful young lady I had seen in the study , whom he had married for love ; for she had not a sixpence , and had a world of poor relations ( so our fellows said ) ready to swarm the Doctor out of house and home . Also , how the Doctor ’s cogitating manner was attributable to his being always engaged in looking out for Greek roots ; which , in my innocence and ignorance , I supposed to be a botanical furor on the Doctor ’s part , especially as he always looked at the ground when he walked about , until I understood that they were roots of words , with a view to a new Dictionary which he had in contemplation . Adams , our head - boy , who had a turn for mathematics , had made a calculation , I was informed , of the time this Dictionary would take in completing , on the Doctor ’s plan , and at the Doctor ’s rate of going . He considered that it might be done in one thousand six hundred and forty - nine years , counting from the Doctor ’s last , or sixty - second , birthday . But the Doctor himself was the idol of the whole school : and it must have been a badly composed school if he had been anything else , for he was the kindest of men ; with a simple faith in him that might have touched the stone hearts of the very urns upon the wall . As he walked up and down that part of the courtyard which was at the side of the house , with the stray rooks and jackdaws looking after him with their heads cocked slyly , as if they knew how much more knowing they were in worldly affairs than he , if any sort of vagabond could only get near enough to his creaking shoes to attract his attention to one sentence of a tale of distress , that vagabond was made for the next two days . It was so notorious in the house , that the masters and head - boys took pains to cut these marauders off at angles , and to get out of windows , and turn them out of the courtyard , before they could make the Doctor aware of their presence ; which was sometimes happily effected within a few yards of him , without his knowing anything of the matter , as he jogged to and fro . Outside his own domain , and unprotected , he was a very sheep for the shearers . He would have taken his gaiters off his legs , to give away . In fact , there was a story current among us ( I have no idea , and never had , on what authority , but I have believed it for so many years that I feel quite certain it is true ) , that on a frosty day , one winter - time , he actually did bestow his gaiters on a beggar - woman , who occasioned some scandal in the neighbourhood by exhibiting a fine infant from door to door , wrapped in those garments , which were universally recognized , being as well known in the vicinity as the Cathedral . The legend added that the only person who did not identify them was the Doctor himself , who , when they were shortly afterwards displayed at the door of a little second - hand shop of no very good repute , where such things were taken in exchange for gin , was more than once observed to handle them approvingly , as if admiring some curious novelty in the pattern , and considering them an improvement on his own . It was very pleasant to see the Doctor with his pretty young wife . He had a fatherly , benignant way of showing his fondness for her , which seemed in itself to express a good man . I often saw them walking in the garden where the peaches were , and I sometimes had a nearer observation of them in the study or the parlour . She appeared to me to take great care of the Doctor , and to like him very much , though I never thought her vitally interested in the Dictionary : some cumbrous fragments of which work the Doctor always carried in his pockets , and in the lining of his hat , and generally seemed to be expounding to her as they walked about . I saw a good deal of Mrs. Strong , both because she had taken a liking for me on the morning of my introduction to the Doctor , and was always afterwards kind to me , and interested in me ; and because she was very fond of Agnes , and was often backwards and forwards at our house . There was a curious constraint between her and Mr. Wickfield , I thought ( of whom she seemed to be afraid ) , that never wore off . When she came there of an evening , she always shrunk from accepting his escort home , and ran away with me instead . And sometimes , as we were running gaily across the Cathedral yard together , expecting to meet nobody , we would meet Mr. Jack Maldon , who was always surprised to see us . Mrs. Strong ’s mama was a lady I took great delight in . Her name was Mrs. Markleham ; but our boys used to call her the Old Soldier , on account of her generalship , and the skill with which she marshalled great forces of relations against the Doctor . She was a little , sharp - eyed woman , who used to wear , when she was dressed , one unchangeable cap , ornamented with some artificial flowers , and two artificial butterflies supposed to be hovering above the flowers . There was a superstition among us that this cap had come from France , and could only originate in the workmanship of that ingenious nation : but all I certainly know about it , is , that it always made its appearance of an evening , wheresoever Mrs. Markleham made HER appearance ; that it was carried about to friendly meetings in a Hindoo basket ; that the butterflies had the gift of trembling constantly ; and that they improved the shining hours at Doctor Strong ’s expense , like busy bees . I observed the Old Soldier -- not to adopt the name disrespectfully -- to pretty good advantage , on a night which is made memorable to me by something else I shall relate . It was the night of a little party at the Doctor ’s , which was given on the occasion of Mr. Jack Maldon ’s departure for India , whither he was going as a cadet , or something of that kind : Mr. Wickfield having at length arranged the business . It happened to be the Doctor ’s birthday , too . We had had a holiday , had made presents to him in the morning , had made a speech to him through the head - boy , and had cheered him until we were hoarse , and until he had shed tears . And now , in the evening , Mr. Wickfield , Agnes , and I , went to have tea with him in his private capacity . Mr. Jack Maldon was there , before us . Mrs. Strong , dressed in white , with cherry - coloured ribbons , was playing the piano , when we went in ; and he was leaning over her to turn the leaves . The clear red and white of her complexion was not so blooming and flower - like as usual , I thought , when she turned round ; but she looked very pretty , Wonderfully pretty . ‘
121416	121428	121414	121414	Doctor	834	’ said Mrs. Strong ’s mama , when we were seated , ‘
121466	121467	121468	121468	I	0	’ ‘
121474	121479	121470	121470	you	834	’ replied the Doctor . ‘
121489	121495	121482	121487	many , many , happy returns	2652	’ said the Old Soldier . ‘
121557	121558	121546	121546	Annie	318	’ ‘
121563	121568	121546	121546	Annie	318	’ said Mrs. Strong , ‘
121574	121575	121546	121546	Annie	318	’ ‘
121583	121588	121576	121576	Annie	318	’ returned her mother . ‘
121618	121619	121609	121609	you	388	’ ‘
121622	121628	121629	121629	Annie	318	’ exclaimed Mr. Jack Maldon . ‘
121633	121634	121637	121637	John	388	’ ‘
121639	121644	121645	121645	Virtually	389	’ returned the Soldier . ‘
121791	121848	121857	121857	you	834	’ The Doctor , in the goodness of his heart , waved his hand as if to make light of it , and save Mr. Jack Maldon from any further reminder . But Mrs. Markleham changed her chair for one next the Doctor ’s , and putting her fan on his coat - sleeve , said : ‘
121908	121909	121899	121899	You	834	’ ‘
121914	121919	121899	121899	You	834	’ said the Doctor . ‘
121929	121935	121924	121924	I	0	’ retorted the Old Soldier . ‘
122093	122094	122090	122090	you	834	’ ‘
122099	122108	122090	122090	you	834	’ returned the Doctor , good - humouredly . ‘
122112	122113	122090	122090	you	834	’ ‘
122119	122132	122133	122133	I	0	’ said the Old Soldier , laying her fan upon his lips . ‘
122460	122505	122506	122506	Mama	382	’ The daughter had sat quite silent and still during this speech , with her eyes fixed on the ground ; her cousin standing near her , and looking on the ground too . She now said very softly , in a trembling voice : ‘
122514	122515	122506	122506	Mama	382	’ ‘
122522	122528	122520	122520	Annie	318	’ returned the Old Soldier , ‘
122599	122635	122593	122597	that silly wife of yours	2697	’ As the Doctor turned his kind face , with its smile of simplicity and gentleness , towards her , she drooped her head more . I noticed that Mr. Wickfield looked at her steadily . ‘
122650	122666	122689	122689	she	2697	’ pursued her mother , shaking her head and her fan at her , playfully , ‘
122726	122727	122722	122722	she	2697	’ ‘
122733	122738	122728	122728	Annie	318	’ said the Doctor . ‘
122750	122751	122756	122756	I	0	’ ‘
122761	122766	122756	122756	I	0	’ exclaimed her mother . ‘
122805	122806	122798	122798	Doctor	377	’ ‘
122815	122820	122822	122822	I	0	’ returned the Doctor . ‘
122824	122825	122822	122822	I	0	’ ‘
122828	122829	122822	122822	I	0	’ ‘
122837	122843	122834	122834	I	0	’ said the Old Soldier . ‘
122849	123555	123556	123556	Annie	318	’ And having , I suppose , carried her point , she tapped the Doctor ’s hand several times with her fan ( which she kissed first ) , and returned triumphantly to her former station . Some more company coming in , among whom were the two masters and Adams , the talk became general ; and it naturally turned on Mr. Jack Maldon , and his voyage , and the country he was going to , and his various plans and prospects . He was to leave that night , after supper , in a post - chaise , for Gravesend ; where the ship , in which he was to make the voyage , lay ; and was to be gone -- unless he came home on leave , or for his health -- I do n’t know how many years . I recollect it was settled by general consent that India was quite a misrepresented country , and had nothing objectionable in it , but a tiger or two , and a little heat in the warm part of the day . For my own part , I looked on Mr. Jack Maldon as a modern Sindbad , and pictured him the bosom friend of all the Rajahs in the East , sitting under canopies , smoking curly golden pipes -- a mile long , if they could be straightened out . Mrs. Strong was a very pretty singer : as I knew , who often heard her singing by herself . But , whether she was afraid of singing before people , or was out of voice that evening , it was certain that she could n’t sing at all . She tried a duet , once , with her cousin Maldon , but could not so much as begin ; and afterwards , when she tried to sing by herself , although she began sweetly , her voice died away on a sudden , and left her quite distressed , with her head hanging down over the keys . The good Doctor said she was nervous , and , to relieve her , proposed a round game at cards ; of which he knew as much as of the art of playing the trombone . But I remarked that the Old Soldier took him into custody directly , for her partner ; and instructed him , as the first preliminary of initiation , to give her all the silver he had in his pocket . We had a merry game , not made the less merry by the Doctor ’s mistakes , of which he committed an innumerable quantity , in spite of the watchfulness of the butterflies , and to their great aggravation . Mrs. Strong had declined to play , on the ground of not feeling very well ; and her cousin Maldon had excused himself because he had some packing to do . When he had done it , however , he returned , and they sat together , talking , on the sofa . From time to time she came and looked over the Doctor ’s hand , and told him what to play . She was very pale , as she bent over him , and I thought her finger trembled as she pointed out the cards ; but the Doctor was quite happy in her attention , and took no notice of this , if it were so . At supper , we were hardly so gay . Everyone appeared to feel that a parting of that sort was an awkward thing , and that the nearer it approached , the more awkward it was . Mr. Jack Maldon tried to be very talkative , but was not at his ease , and made matters worse . And they were not improved , as it appeared to me , by the Old Soldier : who continually recalled passages of Mr. Jack Maldon ’s youth . The Doctor , however , who felt , I am sure , that he was making everybody happy , was well pleased , and had no suspicion but that we were all at the utmost height of enjoyment . ‘
123561	123575	123556	123556	Annie	318	’ said he , looking at his watch , and filling his glass , ‘
123670	123671	123857	123857	her	387	’ ‘
123678	123738	123857	123857	her	387	’ said Mrs. Markleham--‘however it ’s viewed , it ’s affecting , to see a fine young man one has known from an infant , going away to the other end of the world , leaving all he knows behind , and not knowing what ’s before him . A young man really well deserves constant support and patronage , ’
123744	123750	123857	123857	her	387	‘ who makes such sacrifices . ’
123751	123763	123765	123766	the Doctor	838	‘ Time will go fast with you , Mr. Jack Maldon , ’
123768	123849	123765	123766	the Doctor	838	‘ and fast with all of us . Some of us can hardly expect , perhaps , in the natural course of things , to greet you on your return . The next best thing is to hope to do it , and that ’s my case . I shall not weary you with good advice . You have long had a good model before you , in your cousin Annie . Imitate her virtues as nearly as you can . ’
123860	123866	123868	123869	the Doctor	838	‘ Farewell , Mr. Jack , ’
123881	123898	123868	123869	the Doctor	838	‘ A prosperous voyage out , a thriving career abroad , and a happy return home ! ’
124109	124114	124105	124106	Mrs. Markleham	387	‘ Where ’s Annie ? ’
124217	124262	124208	124208	his	838	‘ Poor Annie ! She ’s so faithful and tender - hearted ! It ’s the parting from her old playfellow and friend -- her favourite cousin -- that has done this . Ah ! It ’s a pity ! I am very sorry ! ’
124386	124392	124394	124395	her mother	1035	‘ Annie , my dear , ’
124403	124429	124394	124395	her mother	1035	‘ See here ! You have lost a bow . Will anybody be so good as find a ribbon ; a cherry - coloured ribbon ? ’
124462	124474	124476	124477	her mother	1035	‘ Do you recollect where you had it last , Annie ? ’
126222	126225	126227	126228	Mr. Dick	363	‘ Trotwood , ’
126246	126260	126227	126228	Mr. Dick	363	‘ who ’s the man that hides near our house and frightens her ? ’
126261	126268	126269	126270	Mr. Dick	363	‘ Frightens my aunt , sir ? ’
126273	126282	126283	126283	he	363	‘ I thought nothing would have frightened her , ’
126286	126289	126283	126283	he	363	‘ for she’s-- ’
126295	126309	126291	126291	he	363	‘ do n’t mention it -- the wisest and most wonderful of women . ’
126331	126338	126340	126341	Mr. Dick	363	‘ The first time he came , ’
126343	126376	126340	126341	Mr. Dick	363	‘ was -- let me see -- sixteen hundred and forty - nine was the date of King Charles ’s execution . I think you said sixteen hundred and forty - nine ? ’
126377	126382	126402	126402	his	363	‘ Yes , sir . ’
126383	126393	126395	126396	Mr. Dick	363	‘ I do n’t know how it can be , ’
126405	126417	126402	126402	his	363	‘ I do n’t think I am as old as that . ’
126418	126431	126432	126432	I	0	‘ Was it in that year that the man appeared , sir ? ’
126435	126439	126441	126442	Mr. Dick	363	‘ Why , really ’
126444	126469	126441	126442	Mr. Dick	363	‘ I do n’t see how it can have been in that year , Trotwood . Did you get that date out of history ? ’
126470	126475	126402	126402	his	363	‘ Yes , sir . ’
126476	126486	126488	126489	Mr. Dick	363	‘ I suppose history never lies , does it ? ’
126497	126505	126488	126489	Mr. Dick	363	‘ Oh dear , no , sir ! ’
126523	126531	126533	126534	Mr. Dick	363	‘ I ca n’t make it out , ’
126540	126605	126537	126537	his	363	‘ There ’s something wrong , somewhere . However , it was very soon after the mistake was made of putting some of the trouble out of King Charles ’s head into my head , that the man first came . I was walking out with Miss Trotwood after tea , just at dark , and there he was , close to our house . ’
126606	126610	126611	126611	I	0	‘ Walking about ? ’
126614	126618	126620	126621	Mr. Dick	363	‘ Walking about ? ’
126623	126646	126647	126647	I	0	‘ Let me see , I must recollect a bit . N - no , no ; he was not walking about . ’
126664	126674	126676	126677	Mr. Dick	363	‘ Well , he was n’t there at all , ’
126679	126734	126676	126677	Mr. Dick	363	‘ until he came up behind her , and whispered . Then she turned round and fainted , and I stood still and looked at him , and he walked away ; but that he should have been hiding ever since ( in the ground or somewhere ) , is the most extraordinary thing ! ’
126735	126743	126744	126744	I	0	‘ HAS he been hiding ever since ? ’
126747	126754	126756	126757	Mr. Dick	363	‘ To be sure he has , ’
126764	126793	126760	126760	his	363	‘ Never came out , till last night ! We were walking last night , and he came up behind her again , and I knew him again . ’
126794	126803	126812	126813	Mr. Dick	363	‘ And did he frighten my aunt again ? ’
126804	126810	126812	126813	Mr. Dick	363	‘ All of a shiver , ’
126824	126839	126812	126813	Mr. Dick	363	‘ Held by the palings . Cried . But , Trotwood , come here , ’
126853	126867	126847	126847	he	363	‘ why did she give him money , boy , in the moonlight ? ’
126868	126876	126877	126878	Mr. Dick	363	‘ He was a beggar , perhaps . ’

128293	128356	128364	128365	Master Copperfield	232	’ I really had not yet been able to make up my mind whether I liked Uriah or detested him ; and I was very doubtful about it still , as I stood looking him in the face in the street . But I felt it quite an affront to be supposed proud , and said I only wanted to be asked . ‘
128367	128371	128364	128365	Master Copperfield	232	’ said Uriah , ‘
128418	128474	128475	128475	Mother	386	’ I said I would mention it to Mr. Wickfield , and if he approved , as I had no doubt he would , I would come with pleasure . So , at six o’clock that evening , which was one of the early office evenings , I announced myself as ready , to Uriah . ‘
128482	128492	128475	128475	Mother	386	’ he said , as we walked away together . ‘

128592	128601	128585	128585	you	232	’ I asked , to change the subject . ‘
128607	128619	128604	128605	Master Copperfield	232	’ he said , with an air of self - denial , ‘

128684	128711	128671	128671	I	0	’ After beating a little tune on his chin as he walked on , with the two forefingers of his skeleton right hand , he added : ‘

129452	129499	129501	129502	Mrs. Heep	392	‘ has looked forward to this , sir , a long while . He had his fears that our umbleness stood in the way , and I joined in them myself . Umble we are , umble we have been , umble we shall ever be , ’

130177	130184	130187	130188	Mr. Micawber	341	‘ Copperfield ! Is it possible ? ’
130229	130234	130236	130237	Mr. Micawber	341	‘ My dear Copperfield , ’
130244	130349	130236	130237	Mr. Micawber	341	‘ this is indeed a meeting which is calculated to impress the mind with a sense of the instability and uncertainty of all human -- in short , it is a most extraordinary meeting . Walking along the street , reflecting upon the probability of something turning up ( of which I am at present rather sanguine ) , I find a young but valued friend turn up , who is connected with the most eventful period of my life ; I may say , with the turning - point of my existence . Copperfield , my dear fellow , how do you do ? ’
130394	130398	130400	130401	Mr. Micawber	341	‘ Thank you , ’
130420	130441	130443	130444	Mr. Micawber	341	‘ She is tolerably convalescent . The twins no longer derive their sustenance from Nature ’s founts -- in short , ’
130454	130501	130502	130502	I	0	‘ they are weaned -- and Mrs. Micawber is , at present , my travelling companion . She will be rejoiced , Copperfield , to renew her acquaintance with one who has proved himself in all respects a worthy minister at the sacred altar of friendship . ’
130512	130518	130520	130521	Mr. Micawber	341	‘ You are very good , ’
130538	130546	130548	130549	Mr. Micawber	341	‘ I have discovered my friend Copperfield , ’
130560	130589	130591	130592	Mr. Micawber	341	‘ not in solitude , but partaking of a social meal in company with a widow lady , and one who is apparently her offspring -- in short , ’
130602	130616	130591	130592	Mr. Micawber	341	‘ her son . I shall esteem it an honour to be presented . ’
130667	130676	130678	130679	Mr. Micawber	341	‘ Any friend of my friend Copperfield ’s , ’
130681	130689	130678	130679	Mr. Micawber	341	‘ has a personal claim upon myself . ’
130690	130698	130700	130701	Mrs. Heep	392	‘ We are too umble , sir , ’

130762	130782	130755	130756	Mr. Micawber	341	‘ you are very obliging : and what are you doing , Copperfield ? Still in the wine trade ? ’
130824	130828	130830	130831	Mr. Micawber	341	‘ A pupil ? ’
130837	130889	130834	130834	his	341	‘ I am extremely happy to hear it . Although a mind like my friend Copperfield’s’--to Uriah and Mrs. Heep--‘does not require that cultivation which , without his knowledge of men and things , it would require , still it is a rich soil teeming with latent vegetation -- in short , ’
130902	130917	130891	130892	Mr. Micawber	341	‘ it is an intellect capable of getting up the classics to any extent . ’
130949	130960	130961	130961	I	0	‘ Shall we go and see Mrs. Micawber , sir ? ’
130970	130981	130983	130984	Mr. Micawber	341	‘ If you will do her that favour , Copperfield , ’
130988	131024	130983	130984	Mr. Micawber	341	‘ I have no scruple in saying , in the presence of our friends here , that I am a man who has , for some years , contended against the pressure of pecuniary difficulties . ’
131047	131144	131146	131147	Mr. Micawber	341	‘ Sometimes I have risen superior to my difficulties . Sometimes my difficulties have -- in short , have floored me . There have been times when I have administered a succession of facers to them ; there have been times when they have been too many for me , and I have given in , and said to Mrs. Micawber , in the words of Cato , “ Plato , thou reasonest well . It ’s all up now . I can show fight no more . ” But at no time of my life , ’
131149	131198	131146	131147	Mr. Micawber	341	‘ have I enjoyed a higher degree of satisfaction than in pouring my griefs ( if I may describe difficulties , chiefly arising out of warrants of attorney and promissory notes at two and four months , by that word ) into the bosom of my friend Copperfield . ’
131208	131221	131199	131200	Mr. Micawber	341	‘ Mr. Heep ! Good evening . Mrs. Heep ! Your servant , ’
131401	131418	131394	131395	Mr. Micawber	341	‘ My dear , allow me to introduce to you a pupil of Doctor Strong ’s . ’
131502	131506	131508	131509	Mr. Micawber	341	‘ My dear , ’
131511	131556	131508	131509	Mr. Micawber	341	‘ if you will mention to Copperfield what our present position is , which I have no doubt he will like to know , I will go and look at the paper the while , and see whether anything turns up among the advertisements . ’

131607	131611	131613	131614	Mrs. Micawber	342	‘ Just so , ’
131616	131691	131693	131694	Mrs. Micawber	342	‘ To be on the spot . But , the truth is , talent is not wanted in the Custom House . The local influence of my family was quite unavailing to obtain any employment in that department , for a man of Mr. Micawber ’s abilities . They would rather NOT have a man of Mr. Micawber ’s abilities . He would only show the deficiency of the others . Apart from which , ’
131696	131769	131771	131772	Mrs. Micawber	342	‘ I will not disguise from you , my dear Master Copperfield , that when that branch of my family which is settled in Plymouth , became aware that Mr. Micawber was accompanied by myself , and by little Wilkins and his sister , and by the twins , they did not receive him with that ardour which he might have expected , being so newly released from captivity . In fact , ’

131863	131879	131852	131853	Mr. Micawber	341	’ I said , and thought , that they ought to be ashamed of themselves . ‘
131886	131891	131852	131853	Mr. Micawber	341	’ continued Mrs. Micawber . ‘

131960	131965	131954	131954	We	2896	’ replied Mrs. Micawber . ‘
132004	132011	132001	132002	Master Copperfield	232	’ said Mrs. Micawber , argumentatively . ‘
132032	132033	132036	132036	ma’am	8495	’ ‘
132038	132041	132036	132036	ma’am	8495	’ said I. ‘

132167	132174	132175	132175	I	0	’ said Mrs. Micawber with emotion , ‘
132182	132190	132191	132191	We	2913	’ I murmured my admiration and approbation . ‘
132194	132199	132191	132191	We	2913	’ repeated Mrs. Micawber , ‘
132329	132334	132356	132357	Master Copperfield	232	’ said Mrs. Micawber , ‘
132397	132405	132406	132406	I	0	’ said Mrs. Micawber with much feeling , ‘
132433	132498	132499	132499	Copperfield	232	’ I felt the utmost sympathy for Mr. and Mrs. Micawber in this anxious extremity , and said as much to Mr. Micawber , who now returned : adding that I only wished I had money enough , to lend them the amount they needed . Mr. Micawber ’s answer expressed the disturbance of his mind . He said , shaking hands with me , ‘
132529	132853	132863	132863	Copperfield	232	’ At this dreadful hint Mrs. Micawber threw her arms round Mr. Micawber ’s neck and entreated him to be calm . He wept ; but so far recovered , almost immediately , as to ring the bell for the waiter , and bespeak a hot kidney pudding and a plate of shrimps for breakfast in the morning . When I took my leave of them , they both pressed me so much to come and dine before they went away , that I could not refuse . But , as I knew I could not come next day , when I should have a good deal to prepare in the evening , Mr. Micawber arranged that he would call at Doctor Strong ’s in the course of the morning ( having a presentiment that the remittance would arrive by that post ) , and propose the day after , if it would suit me better . Accordingly I was called out of school next forenoon , and found Mr. Micawber in the parlour ; who had called to say that the dinner would take place as proposed . When I asked him if the remittance had come , he pressed my hand and departed . As I was looking out of window that same evening , it surprised me , and made me rather uneasy , to see Mr. Micawber and Uriah Heep walk past , arm in arm : Uriah humbly sensible of the honour that was done him , and Mr. Micawber taking a bland delight in extending his patronage to Uriah . But I was still more surprised , when I went to the little hotel next day at the appointed dinner - hour , which was four o’clock , to find , from what Mr. Micawber said , that he had gone home with Uriah , and had drunk brandy - and - water at Mrs. Heep ’s . ‘
132865	132870	132871	132872	your friend	1910	’ said Mr. Micawber , ‘
132927	133225	133227	133227	you	2934	’ I hardly understood how this could have been , seeing that Mr. Micawber had paid them nothing at all as it was ; but I did not like to ask . Neither did I like to say , that I hoped he had not been too communicative to Uriah ; or to inquire if they had talked much about me . I was afraid of hurting Mr. Micawber ’s feelings , or , at all events , Mrs. Micawber ’s , she being very sensitive ; but I was uncomfortable about it , too , and often thought about it afterwards . We had a beautiful little dinner . Quite an elegant dish of fish ; the kidney - end of a loin of veal , roasted ; fried sausage - meat ; a partridge , and a pudding . There was wine , and there was strong ale ; and after dinner Mrs. Micawber made us a bowl of hot punch with her own hands . Mr. Micawber was uncommonly convivial . I never saw him such good company . He made his face shine with the punch , so that it looked as if it had been varnished all over . He got cheerfully sentimental about the town , and proposed success to it ; observing that Mrs. Micawber and himself had been made extremely snug and comfortable there and that he never should forget the agreeable hours they had passed in Canterbury . He proposed me afterwards ; and he , and Mrs. Micawber , and I , took a review of our past acquaintance , in the course of which we sold the property all over again . Then I proposed Mrs. Micawber : or , at least , said , modestly , ‘
133248	133332	133235	133235	I	0	’ On which Mr. Micawber delivered an eulogium on Mrs. Micawber ’s character , and said she had ever been his guide , philosopher , and friend , and that he would recommend me , when I came to a marrying time of life , to marry such another woman , if such another woman could be found . As the punch disappeared , Mr. Micawber became still more friendly and convivial . Mrs. Micawber ’s spirits becoming elevated , too , we sang ‘
133336	133342	133333	133335	Auld Lang Syne	398	’ . When we came to ‘
133351	133367	133235	133235	I	0	’ , we all joined hands round the table ; and when we declared we would ‘
133374	133467	133468	133468	My	0	’ , and had n’t the least idea what it meant , we were really affected . In a word , I never saw anybody so thoroughly jovial as Mr. Micawber was , down to the very last moment of the evening , when I took a hearty farewell of himself and his amiable wife . Consequently , I was not prepared , at seven o’clock next morning , to receive the following communication , dated half past nine in the evening ; a quarter of an hour after I had left him:-- ‘
133473	133592	133468	133471	My DEAR YOUNG FRIEND	2142	‘ The die is cast -- all is over . Hiding the ravages of care with a sickly mask of mirth , I have not informed you , this evening , that there is no hope of the remittance ! Under these circumstances , alike humiliating to endure , humiliating to contemplate , and humiliating to relate , I have discharged the pecuniary liability contracted at this establishment , by giving a note of hand , made payable fourteen days after date , at my residence , Pentonville , London . When it becomes due , it will not be taken up . The result is destruction . The bolt is impending , and the tree must fall . ‘
133673	133688	133734	133735	Doctor Strong	377	‘ This is the last communication , my dear Copperfield , you will ever receive ‘
133690	133692	133734	133735	Doctor Strong	377	‘ The ‘
133696	133700	133734	133735	Doctor Strong	377	‘ WILKINS MICAWBER . ’
134080	134083	134078	134078	Agnes	375	‘ No , ’
134087	134090	134085	134085	I	0	‘ Yes , ’
134205	134235	134199	134206	a boarder at the Misses Nettingalls ’ establishment	11123	’ establishment . I adore Miss Shepherd . She is a little girl , in a spencer , with a round face and curly flaxen hair . The Misses Nettingalls ’
134306	134312	134298	134298	I	0	‘ Oh , Miss Shepherd ! ’
134630	134722	134627	134629	the Misses Nettingalls	400	’ establishment out walking . Miss Shepherd makes a face as she goes by , and laughs to her companion . All is over . The devotion of a life -- it seems a life , it is all the same -- is at an end ; Miss Shepherd comes out of the morning service , and the Royal Family know her no more . I am higher in the school , and no one breaks my peace . I am not at all polite , now , to the Misses Nettingalls ’
134947	136213	134933	134933	He	2975	‘ em . He names individuals among them ( myself included ) , whom he could undertake to settle with one hand , and the other tied behind him . He waylays the smaller boys to punch their unprotected heads , and calls challenges after me in the open streets . For these sufficient reasons I resolve to fight the butcher . It is a summer evening , down in a green hollow , at the corner of a wall . I meet the butcher by appointment . I am attended by a select body of our boys ; the butcher , by two other butchers , a young publican , and a sweep . The preliminaries are adjusted , and the butcher and myself stand face to face . In a moment the butcher lights ten thousand candles out of my left eyebrow . In another moment , I do n’t know where the wall is , or where I am , or where anybody is . I hardly know which is myself and which the butcher , we are always in such a tangle and tussle , knocking about upon the trodden grass . Sometimes I see the butcher , bloody but confident ; sometimes I see nothing , and sit gasping on my second ’s knee ; sometimes I go in at the butcher madly , and cut my knuckles open against his face , without appearing to discompose him at all . At last I awake , very queer about the head , as from a giddy sleep , and see the butcher walking off , congratulated by the two other butchers and the sweep and publican , and putting on his coat as he goes ; from which I augur , justly , that the victory is his . I am taken home in a sad plight , and I have beef - steaks put to my eyes , and am rubbed with vinegar and brandy , and find a great puffy place bursting out on my upper lip , which swells immoderately . For three or four days I remain at home , a very ill - looking subject , with a green shade over my eyes ; and I should be very dull , but that Agnes is a sister to me , and condoles with me , and reads to me , and makes the time light and happy . Agnes has my confidence completely , always ; I tell her all about the butcher , and the wrongs he has heaped upon me ; she thinks I could n’t have done otherwise than fight the butcher , while she shrinks and trembles at my having fought him . Time has stolen on unobserved , for Adams is not the head - boy in the days that are come now , nor has he been this many and many a day . Adams has left the school so long , that when he comes back , on a visit to Doctor Strong , there are not many there , besides myself , who know him . Adams is going to be called to the bar almost directly , and is to be an advocate , and to wear a wig . I am surprised to find him a meeker man than I had thought , and less imposing in appearance . He has not staggered the world yet , either ; for it goes on ( as well as I can make out ) pretty much the same as if he had never joined it . A blank , through which the warriors of poetry and history march on in stately hosts that seem to have no end -- and what comes next ! I am the head - boy , now ! I look down on the line of boys below me , with a condescending interest in such of them as bring to my mind the boy I was myself , when I first came there . That little fellow seems to be no part of me ; I remember him as something left behind upon the road of life -- as something I have passed , rather than have actually been -- and almost think of him as of someone else . And the little girl I saw on that first day at Mr. Wickfield ’s , where is she ? Gone also . In her stead , the perfect likeness of the picture , a child likeness no more , moves about the house ; and Agnes -- my sweet sister , as I call her in my thoughts , my counsellor and friend , the better angel of the lives of all who come within her calm , good , self - denying influence -- is quite a woman . What other changes have come upon me , besides the changes in my growth and looks , and in the knowledge I have garnered all this while ? I wear a gold watch and chain , a ring upon my little finger , and a long - tailed coat ; and I use a great deal of bear ’s grease -- which , taken in conjunction with the ring , looks bad . Am I in love again ? I am . I worship the eldest Miss Larkins . The eldest Miss Larkins is not a little girl . She is a tall , dark , black - eyed , fine figure of a woman . The eldest Miss Larkins is not a chicken ; for the youngest Miss Larkins is not that , and the eldest must be three or four years older . Perhaps the eldest Miss Larkins may be about thirty . My passion for her is beyond all bounds . The eldest Miss Larkins knows officers . It is an awful thing to bear . I see them speaking to her in the street . I see them cross the way to meet her , when her bonnet ( she has a bright taste in bonnets ) is seen coming down the pavement , accompanied by her sister ’s bonnet . She laughs and talks , and seems to like it . I spend a good deal of my own spare time in walking up and down to meet her . If I can bow to her once in the day ( I know her to bow to , knowing Mr. Larkins ) , I am happier . I deserve a bow now and then . The raging agonies I suffer on the night of the Race Ball , where I know the eldest Miss Larkins will be dancing with the military , ought to have some compensation , if there be even - handed justice in the world . My passion takes away my appetite , and makes me wear my newest silk neckerchief continually . I have no relief but in putting on my best clothes , and having my boots cleaned over and over again . I seem , then , to be worthier of the eldest Miss Larkins . Everything that belongs to her , or is connected with her , is precious to me . Mr. Larkins ( a gruff old gentleman with a double chin , and one of his eyes immovable in his head ) is fraught with interest to me . When I ca n’t meet his daughter , I go where I am likely to meet him . To say ‘
136233	136543	136546	136547	Mr. Copperfield	232	’ seems so pointed , that I blush . I think continually about my age . Say I am seventeen , and say that seventeen is young for the eldest Miss Larkins , what of that ? Besides , I shall be one - and - twenty in no time almost . I regularly take walks outside Mr. Larkins ’s house in the evening , though it cuts me to the heart to see the officers go in , or to hear them up in the drawing - room , where the eldest Miss Larkins plays the harp . I even walk , on two or three occasions , in a sickly , spoony manner , round and round the house after the family are gone to bed , wondering which is the eldest Miss Larkins ’s chamber ( and pitching , I dare say now , on Mr. Larkins ’s instead ) ; wishing that a fire would burst out ; that the assembled crowd would stand appalled ; that I , dashing through them with a ladder , might rear it against her window , save her in my arms , go back for something she had left behind , and perish in the flames . For I am generally disinterested in my love , and think I could be content to make a figure before Miss Larkins , and expire . Generally , but not always . Sometimes brighter visions rise before me . When I dress ( the occupation of two hours ) , for a great ball given at the Larkins ’s ( the anticipation of three weeks ) , I indulge my fancy with pleasing images . I picture myself taking courage to make a declaration to Miss Larkins . I picture Miss Larkins sinking her head upon my shoulder , and saying , ‘
136555	136569	136546	136547	Mr. Copperfield	232	’ I picture Mr. Larkins waiting on me next morning , and saying , ‘
136595	136842	136844	136844	you	2986	’ I picture my aunt relenting , and blessing us ; and Mr. Dick and Doctor Strong being present at the marriage ceremony . I am a sensible fellow , I believe -- I believe , on looking back , I mean -- and modest I am sure ; but all this goes on notwithstanding . I repair to the enchanted house , where there are lights , chattering , music , flowers , officers ( I am sorry to see ) , and the eldest Miss Larkins , a blaze of beauty . She is dressed in blue , with blue flowers in her hair -- forget - me - nots -- as if SHE had any need to wear forget - me - nots . It is the first really grown - up party that I have ever been invited to , and I am a little uncomfortable ; for I appear not to belong to anybody , and nobody appears to have anything to say to me , except Mr. Larkins , who asks me how my schoolfellows are , which he need n’t do , as I have not come there to be insulted . But after I have stood in the doorway for some time , and feasted my eyes upon the goddess of my heart , she approaches me -- she , the eldest Miss Larkins!--and asks me pleasantly , if I dance ?

He is wretched , I have no doubt ; but he is nothing to me . I have been wretched , too . I waltz with the eldest Miss Larkins ! I do n’t know where , among whom , or how long . I only know that I swim about in space , with a blue angel , in a state of blissful delirium , until I find myself alone with her in a little room , resting on a sofa . She admires a flower ( pink camellia japonica , price half - a - crown ) , in my button - hole . I give it her , and say : ‘

Suppose you were to go down into the old part of the country again , for instance , and see that -- that out - of - the - way woman with the savagest of names , ’
138385	138401	138374	138374	she	731	‘ Of all things in the world , aunt , I should like it best ! ’

138410	138454	138407	138408	my aunt	731	‘ that ’s lucky , for I should like it too . But it ’s natural and rational that you should like it . And I am very well persuaded that whatever you do , Trot , will always be natural and rational . ’

138749	138786	138792	138792	her	731	‘ --I do n’t mean physically , but morally ; you are very well physically -- is , a firm fellow . A fine firm fellow , with a will of your own . With resolution , ’

That ’s what I want you to be . That ’s what your father and mother might both have been , Heaven knows , and been the better for it . ’
138878	138902	138904	138905	my aunt	731	‘ That you may begin , in a small way , to have a reliance upon yourself , and to act for yourself , ’

139015	139046	139048	139049	Mr. Dick	363	‘ I intend , Trotwood , to get that done immediately -- it really must be done immediately ! And then it will go in , you know -- and then-- ’

139377	139414	139372	139372	she	3035	‘ No . It ’s because you are like no one else . You are so good , and so sweet - tempered . You have such a gentle nature , and you are always right . ’

139471	139527	139459	139459	I	0	‘ But I shall confide in you , just the same , Agnes . I can never grow out of that . Whenever I fall into trouble , or fall in love , I shall always tell you , if you ’ll let me -- even when I come to fall in love in earnest . ’
139528	139538	139540	139540	Agnes	375	‘ Why , you have always been in earnest ! ’
139545	139558	139560	139560	I	0	‘ Oh ! that was as a child , or a schoolboy , ’
139576	139617	139618	139618	Agnes	375	‘ Times are altering now , and I suppose I shall be in a terrible state of earnestness one day or other . My wonder is , that you are not in earnest yourself , by this time , Agnes . ’
139627	139636	139638	139638	I	0	‘ Oh , I know you are not ! ’
139640	139664	139665	139665	you	0	‘ because if you had been you would have told me . Or at least’--for I saw a faint blush in her face , ‘
139753	139808	139749	139749	I	0	’ We had gone on , so far , in a mixture of confidential jest and earnest , that had long grown naturally out of our familiar relations , begun as mere children . But Agnes , now suddenly lifting up her eyes to mine , and speaking in a different manner , said : ‘
139860	139905	139852	139852	you	228	’ I had observed it , and had often wondered whether she had too . I must have shown as much , now , in my face ; for her eyes were in a moment cast down , and I saw tears in them . ‘
139912	139921	139922	139922	I	0	’ she said , in a low voice . ‘

139942	139946	139926	139926	I	0	’ she said . ‘

140043	140047	140027	140027	he	381	’ said Agnes . ‘
140143	140398	140399	140399	I	0	’ Her hand passed softly before my lips while I was yet speaking , and in a moment she had met her father at the door of the room , and was hanging on his shoulder . The expression of her face , as they both looked towards me , I felt to be very touching . There was such deep fondness for him , and gratitude to him for all his love and care , in her beautiful look ; and there was such a fervent appeal to me to deal tenderly by him , even in my inmost thoughts , and to let no harsh construction find any place against him ; she was , at once , so proud of him and devoted to him , yet so compassionate and sorry , and so reliant upon me to be so , too ; that nothing she could have said would have expressed more to me , or moved me more . We were to drink tea at the Doctor ’s . We went there at the usual hour ; and round the study fireside found the Doctor , and his young wife , and her mother . The Doctor , who made as much of my going away as if I were going to China , received me as an honoured guest ; and called for a log of wood to be thrown on the fire , that he might see the face of his old pupil reddening in the blaze . ‘
140414	140423	140412	140412	Wickfield	372	’ said the Doctor , warming his hands ; ‘

140539	140578	140591	140592	the Doctor	838	’re not imposed on , eh ? As you certainly would be , in any contract you should make for yourself . Well ! I am ready . There are worse tasks than that , in my calling . ’
140579	140589	140591	140592	the Doctor	838	‘ I shall have nothing to think of then , ’
140598	140612	140591	140592	the Doctor	838	‘ but my Dictionary ; and this other contract - bargain -- Annie . ’
140660	140673	140674	140674	he	372	‘ There is a post come in from India , I observe , ’

140703	140708	140714	140714	her	387	‘ Poor dear Jack ! ’
140717	140797	140799	140800	Mrs. Markleham	387	‘ That trying climate!--like living , they tell me , on a sand - heap , underneath a burning - glass ! He looked strong , but he was n’t . My dear Doctor , it was his spirit , not his constitution , that he ventured on so boldly . Annie , my dear , I am sure you must perfectly recollect that your cousin never was strong -- not what can be called ROBUST , you know , ’
140812	140839	140799	140800	Mrs. Markleham	387	‘ --from the time when my daughter and himself were children together , and walking about , arm - in - arm , the livelong day . ’
140849	140866	140868	140869	Mr. Wickfield	372	‘ Do I gather from what you say , ma’am , that Mr. Maldon is ill ? ’
140871	140874	140876	140878	the Old Soldier	10944	‘ Ill ! ’
140880	140892	140876	140878	the Old Soldier	10944	‘ My dear sir , he ’s all sorts of things . ’

140902	140908	140910	140912	the Old Soldier	10944	‘ Except well , indeed ! ’
140914	140947	140949	140951	the Old Soldier	10944	‘ He has had dreadful strokes of the sun , no doubt , and jungle fevers and agues , and every kind of thing you can mention . As to his liver , ’
140954	140971	140949	140951	the Old Soldier	10944	‘ that , of course , he gave up altogether , when he first went out ! ’
140972	140979	140981	140982	Mr. Wickfield	372	‘ Does he say all this ? ’
140984	140991	140981	140982	Mr. Wickfield	372	‘ Say ? My dear sir , ’
141003	141035	140997	140997	her	387	‘ you little know my poor Jack Maldon when you ask that question . Say ? Not he . You might drag him at the heels of four wild horses first . ’
141036	141039	141041	141042	Mrs. Strong	377	‘ Mama ! ’
141044	141050	141041	141042	Mrs. Strong	377	‘ Annie , my dear , ’
141055	141142	141041	141042	Mrs. Strong	377	‘ once for all , I must really beg that you will not interfere with me , unless it is to confirm what I say . You know as well as I do that your cousin Maldon would be dragged at the heels of any number of wild horses -- why should I confine myself to four ! I WON’T confine myself to four -- eight , sixteen , two - and - thirty , rather than say anything calculated to overturn the Doctor ’s plans . ’
141143	141148	141150	141151	the Doctor	838	‘ Wickfield ’s plans , ’
141164	141185	141150	141151	the Doctor	838	‘ That is to say , our joint plans for him . I said myself , abroad or at home . ’
141186	141190	141192	141193	Mr. Wickfield	372	‘ And I said ’
141196	141213	141192	141193	Mr. Wickfield	372	‘ abroad . I was the means of sending him abroad . It ’s my responsibility . ’
141214	141219	141221	141223	the Old Soldier	10944	‘ Oh ! Responsibility ! ’
141225	141293	141295	141297	the Old Soldier	10944	‘ Everything was done for the best , my dear Mr. Wickfield ; everything was done for the kindest and best , we know . But if the dear fellow ca n’t live there , he ca n’t live there . And if he ca n’t live there , he ’ll die there , sooner than he ’ll overturn the Doctor ’s plans . I know him , ’

141343	141405	141339	141340	the Doctor	838	‘ I am not bigoted to my plans , and I can overturn them myself . I can substitute some other plans . If Mr. Jack Maldon comes home on account of ill health , he must not be allowed to go back , and we must endeavour to make some more suitable and fortunate provision for him in this country . ’
141620	141625	141627	141628	Mrs. Markleham	387	‘ Why , here , ’
141644	141727	141627	141628	Mrs. Markleham	387	‘ the dear fellow says to the Doctor himself -- where is it ? Oh!--“I am sorry to inform you that my health is suffering severely , and that I fear I may be reduced to the necessity of returning home for a time , as the only hope of restoration . ” That ’s pretty plain , poor fellow ! His only hope of restoration ! But Annie ’s letter is plainer still . Annie , show me that letter again . ’
141728	141734	141735	141735	she	387	‘ Not now , mama , ’
141742	141764	141735	141735	she	387	‘ My dear , you absolutely are , on some subjects , one of the most ridiculous persons in the world , ’
141769	141828	141735	141735	she	387	‘ and perhaps the most unnatural to the claims of your own family . We never should have heard of the letter at all , I believe , unless I had asked for it myself . Do you call that confidence , my love , towards Doctor Strong ? I am surprised . You ought to know better . ’
141859	141865	141867	141868	Mrs. Markleham	387	‘ Now let us see , ’
141877	141939	141867	141868	Mrs. Markleham	387	‘ where the passage is . “ The remembrance of old times , my dearest Annie”--and so forth -- it ’s not there . “ The amiable old Proctor”--who ’s he ? Dear me , Annie , how illegibly your cousin Maldon writes , and how stupid I am ! “ Doctor , ” of course . Ah ! amiable indeed ! ’
141970	142072	142074	142075	Mrs. Markleham	387	‘ Now I have found it . “ You may not be surprised to hear , Annie,”--no , to be sure , knowing that he never was really strong ; what did I say just now?--“that I have undergone so much in this distant place , as to have decided to leave it at all hazards ; on sick leave , if I can ; on total resignation , if that is not to be obtained . What I have endured , and do endure here , is insupportable . ” And but for the promptitude of that best of creatures , ’
142088	142099	142074	142075	Mrs. Markleham	387	‘ it would be insupportable to me to think of . ’

His chin was cocked over the coachman ’s shoulder , so near to me , that his breath quite tickled the back of my head ; and as I looked at him , he leered at the leaders with the eye with which he did n’t squint , in a very knowing manner . ‘

145784	145811	145781	145782	you sir	9357	’ This was addressed to the waiter , who had been very attentive to our recognition , at a distance , and now came forward deferentially . ‘

145981	146161	145959	145959	sir	979	’ The waiter immediately withdrew to make the exchange . Steerforth , very much amused at my having been put into forty - four , laughed again , and clapped me on the shoulder again , and invited me to breakfast with him next morning at ten o’clock -- an invitation I was only too proud and happy to accept . It being now pretty late , we took our candles and went upstairs , where we parted with friendly heartiness at his door , and where I found my new room a great improvement on my old one , it not being at all musty , and having an immense four - post bedstead in it , which was quite a little landed estate . Here , among pillows enough for six , I soon fell asleep in a blissful condition , and dreamed of ancient Rome , Steerforth , and friendship , until the early morning coaches , rumbling out of the archway underneath , made me dream of thunder and the gods .

146553	146558	146560	146560	Steerforth	314	‘ Now , Copperfield , ’
146567	146598	146560	146560	Steerforth	314	‘ I should like to hear what you are doing , and where you are going , and all about you . I feel as if you were my property . ’

146698	146719	146720	146720	I	0	‘ I should like to be as sure of that , as you are kind enough to say you are , ’
146725	146728	146730	146730	Steerforth	314	‘ Oh ! ’
146732	146750	146730	146730	Steerforth	314	‘ everyone who likes me , has a claim on her that is sure to be acknowledged . ’

146764	146767	146769	146769	Steerforth	314	‘ Good ! ’
146771	146819	146769	146769	Steerforth	314	‘ Come and prove it . We will go and see the lions for an hour or two -- it ’s something to have a fresh fellow like you to show them to , Copperfield -- and then we ’ll journey out to Highgate by the coach . ’
146942	146954	146956	146956	I	0	‘ You ’ll take a high degree at college , Steerforth , ’
146958	146979	146956	146956	I	0	‘ if you have not done so already ; and they will have good reason to be proud of you . ’
146980	146986	146988	146988	Steerforth	314	‘ I take a degree ! ’
146990	147006	146988	146988	Steerforth	314	‘ Not I ! my dear Daisy -- will you mind my calling you Daisy ? ’
147007	147012	147014	147014	I.	0	‘ Not at all ! ’

147095	147140	147088	147088	Steerforth	314	‘ why should I trouble myself , that a parcel of heavy - headed fellows may gape and hold up their hands ? Let them do it at some other man . There ’s fame for him , and he ’s welcome to it . ’
147265	147270	147274	147274	her	3208	‘ My dearest James , ’
147744	147787	147738	147739	Miss Dartle	418	‘ Oh , really ? You know how ignorant I am , and that I only ask for information , but is n’t it always so ? I thought that kind of life was on all hands understood to be -- eh ? ’
147788	147805	147806	147807	Mrs. Steerforth	419	‘ It is education for a very grave profession , if you mean that , Rosa , ’
147813	147823	147825	147826	Miss Dartle	418	‘ Oh ! Yes ! That ’s very true , ’
147828	147851	147825	147826	Miss Dartle	418	‘ But is n’t it , though?--I want to be put right , if I am wrong -- isn’t it , really ? ’
147852	147856	147858	147859	Mrs. Steerforth	419	‘ Really what ? ’
147861	147870	147872	147873	Miss Dartle	418	‘ Oh ! You mean it ’s not ! ’

148084	148208	148211	148213	That bluff fellow	3229	’ Her own views of every question , and her correction of everything that was said to which she was opposed , Miss Dartle insinuated in the same way : sometimes , I could not conceal from myself , with great power , though in contradiction even of Steerforth . An instance happened before dinner was done . Mrs. Steerforth speaking to me about my intention of going down into Suffolk , I said at hazard how glad I should be , if Steerforth would only go there with me ; and explaining to him that I was going to see my old nurse , and Mr. Peggotty ’s family , I reminded him of the boatman whom he had seen at school . ‘
148215	148219	148211	148213	That bluff fellow	3229	’ said Steerforth . ‘

148446	148456	148458	148458	Steerforth	419	‘ Are they what ? And are who what ? ’
148460	148484	148458	148458	Steerforth	419	‘ That sort of people.---Are they really animals and clods , and beings of another order ? I want to know SO much . ’
148485	148499	148501	148501	Steerforth	419	‘ Why , there ’s a pretty wide separation between them and us , ’
148506	148590	148501	148501	Steerforth	419	‘ They are not to be expected to be as sensitive as we are . Their delicacy is not to be shocked , or hurt easily . They are wonderfully virtuous , I dare say -- some people contend for that , at least ; and I am sure I do n’t want to contradict them -- but they have not very fine natures , and they may be thankful that , like their coarse rough skins , they are not easily wounded . ’
148591	148594	148596	148597	Miss Dartle	418	‘ Really ! ’
148599	148683	148596	148597	Miss Dartle	418	‘ Well , I do n’t know , now , when I have been better pleased than to hear that . It ’s so consoling ! It ’s such a delight to know that , when they suffer , they do n’t feel ! Sometimes I have been quite uneasy for that sort of people ; but now I shall just dismiss the idea of them , altogether . Live and learn . I had my doubts , I confess , but now they ’re
148709	148763	148764	148764	She	3242	’ I believed that Steerforth had said what he had , in jest , or to draw Miss Dartle out ; and I expected him to say as much when she was gone , and we two were sitting before the fire . But he merely asked me what I thought of her . ‘
148773	148777	148770	148770	she	3242	’ I asked . ‘
148787	148822	148780	148780	She	3242	’ said Steerforth , and sharpens it , as she has sharpened her own face and figure these years past . She has worn herself away by constant sharpening . She is all edge . ’

148849	148856	148857	148857	he	3242	‘ Why , the fact is , ’
148860	148865	148857	148857	he	3242	‘ I did that . ’
148866	148872	148780	148780	She	3242	‘ By an unfortunate accident ! ’
148873	148904	148905	148905	I	0	‘ No . I was a young boy , and she exasperated me , and I threw a hammer at her . A promising young angel I must have been ! ’
148924	148937	148939	148939	Steerforth	419	‘ She has borne the mark ever since , as you see , ’
148941	149044	148939	148939	Steerforth	419	‘ and she ’ll bear it to her grave , if she ever rests in one -- though I can hardly believe she will ever rest anywhere . She was the motherless child of a sort of cousin of my father ’s . He died one day . My mother , who was then a widow , brought her here to be company to her . She has a couple of thousand pounds of her own , and saves the interest of it every year , to add to the principal . There ’s the history of Miss Rosa Dartle for you . ’
149045	149058	149060	149060	I.	3243	‘ And I have no doubt she loves you like a brother ? ’
149061	149064	149066	149066	Steerforth	419	‘ Humph ! ’
149073	149132	149066	149066	Steerforth	419	‘ Some brothers are not loved over much ; and some love -- but help yourself , Copperfield ! We ’ll drink the daisies of the field , in compliment to you ; and the lilies of the valley that toil not , neither do they spin , in compliment to me -- the more shame for me ! ’
149426	149445	149447	149448	Mrs. Steerforth	419	‘ It was at Mr. Creakle ’s , my son tells me , that you first became acquainted , ’
149467	149508	149451	149451	she	3246	‘ Indeed , I recollect his speaking , at that time , of a pupil younger than himself who had taken his fancy there ; but your name , as you may suppose , has not lived in my memory . ’
149509	149528	149530	149530	I	0	‘ He was very generous and noble to me in those days , I assure you , ma’am , ’
149532	149552	149530	149530	I	0	‘ and I stood in need of such a friend . I should have been quite crushed without him . ’
149553	149561	149563	149564	Mrs. Steerforth	419	‘ He is always generous and noble , ’
149613	149625	149627	149627	she	419	‘ It was not a fit school generally for my son , ’
149629	149693	149627	149627	she	419	‘ far from it ; but there were particular circumstances to be considered at the time , of more importance even than that selection . My son ’s high spirit made it desirable that he should be placed with some man who felt its superiority , and would be content to bow himself before it ; and we found such a man there . ’
149738	149760	149761	149763	the fond lady	3252	‘ My son ’s great capacity was tempted on , there , by a feeling of voluntary emulation and conscious pride , ’
149769	149804	149761	149763	the fond lady	3252	‘ He would have risen against all constraint ; but he found himself the monarch of the place , and he haughtily determined to be worthy of his station . It was like himself . ’
149821	149856	149857	149857	she	3252	‘ So my son took , of his own will , and on no compulsion , to the course in which he can always , when it is his pleasure , outstrip every competitor , ’
149860	149964	149857	149857	she	3252	‘ My son informs me , Mr. Copperfield , that you were quite devoted to him , and that when you met yesterday you made yourself known to him with tears of joy . I should be an affected woman if I made any pretence of being surprised by my son ’s inspiring such emotions ; but I can not be indifferent to anyone who is so sensible of his merit , and I am very glad to see you here , and can assure you that he feels an unusual friendship for you , and that you may rely on his protection . ’

153344	153348	153333	153334	a lady	8849	’ I rejoined . ‘
153355	153367	153333	153334	a lady	8849	’ said Mr. Omer , touching my waistcoat with his forefinger , ‘
153411	153427	153401	153401	Dear	8941	’ Very well , I thanked him , as I hoped he had been too . ‘
153438	153443	153401	153401	Dear	8941	’ said Mr. Omer . ‘
153486	153523	153525	153525	me	0	’ Mr. Omer coughed again , in consequence of laughing , and was assisted out of his fit by his daughter , who now stood close beside us , dancing her smallest child on the counter . ‘

153604	153639	153601	153602	The youngest	3354	’ Minnie laughed , and stroked her banded hair upon her temples , as her father put one of his fat fingers into the hand of the child she was dancing on the counter . ‘
153646	153656	153601	153602	The youngest	3354	’ said Mr. Omer , nodding his head retrospectively . ‘
153699	153707	153695	153695	you	3356	’ I thanked him , but declined . ‘
153712	153717	153718	153718	Barkis	294	’ said Mr. Omer . ‘

154050	154164	154165	154165	You	979	’ I really thought it was all over with Mr. Omer , after he had uttered this libellous pleasantry . He coughed to that extent , and his breath eluded all his attempts to recover it with that obstinacy , that I fully expected to see his head go down behind the counter , and his little black breeches , with the rusty little bunches of ribbons at the knees , come quivering up in a last ineffectual struggle . At length , however , he got better , though he still panted hard , and was so exhausted that he was obliged to sit on the stool of the shop - desk . ‘
154168	154181	154182	154182	she	3375	’ he said , wiping his head , and breathing with difficulty , ‘

154311	154322	154292	154292	she	3375	’ Mr. Omer nodded his head and rubbed his chin . ‘
154382	154387	154376	154376	I	0	’ said Mr. Omer ; ‘

154526	154531	154533	154533	Minnie	328	‘ Yes , father , ’
154535	154543	154533	154533	Minnie	328	‘ Never say I detracted from her ! ’
154544	154548	154550	154551	Mr. Omer	326	‘ Very good , ’
154553	154564	154565	154565	he	8844	‘ That ’s right . And so , young gentleman , ’

154604	154816	154565	154565	he	8844	’ As they had spoken in a subdued tone , while speaking of Em’ly , I had no doubt that she was near . On my asking now , if that were not so , Mr. Omer nodded yes , and nodded towards the door of the parlour . My hurried inquiry if I might peep in , was answered with a free permission ; and , looking through the glass , I saw her sitting at her work . I saw her , a most beautiful little creature , with the cloudless blue eyes , that had looked into my childish heart , turned laughingly upon another child of Minnie ’s who was playing near her ; with enough of wilfulness in her bright face to justify what I had heard ; with much of the old capricious coyness lurking in it ; but with nothing in her pretty looks , I am sure , but what was meant for goodness and for happiness , and what was on a good and happy course . The tune across the yard that seemed as if it never had left off -- alas ! it was the tune that never DOES leave off -- was beating , softly , all the while . ‘
154825	154830	154819	154819	you	3395	’ said Mr. Omer , ‘
154850	154996	155003	155003	ma’am	8495	’ I was too bashful to do so then -- I was afraid of confusing her , and I was no less afraid of confusing myself.--but I informed myself of the hour at which she left of an evening , in order that our visit might be timed accordingly ; and taking leave of Mr. Omer , and his pretty daughter , and her little children , went away to my dear old Peggotty ’s . Here she was , in the tiled kitchen , cooking dinner ! The moment I knocked at the door she opened it , and asked me what I pleased to want . I looked at her with a smile , but she gave me no smile in return . I had never ceased to write to her , but it must have been seven years since we had met . ‘
155005	155016	154998	154999	Mr. Barkis	294	’ I said , feigning to speak roughly to her . ‘
155024	155028	155017	155017	He	3401	’ returned Peggotty , ‘
155038	155039	155030	155030	he	3401	’ ‘
155049	155053	155042	155042	he	3401	’ I asked . ‘
155061	155065	155058	155058	he	3401	’ she answered . ‘
155075	155096	155067	155067	YOU	979	’ She looked at me more attentively , and I noticed a quick movement of her hands towards each other . ‘
155119	155146	155147	155147	Peggotty	234	’ said I. She took a step backward , and put out her hands in an undecided frightened way , as if to keep me off . ‘
155149	155158	155147	155147	Peggotty	234	’ I cried to her . She cried , ‘
155163	155276	155147	155147	Peggotty	234	’ and we both burst into tears , and were locked in one another ’s arms . What extravagances she committed ; what laughing and crying over me ; what pride she showed , what joy , what sorrow that she whose pride and joy I might have been , could never hold me in a fond embrace ; I have not the heart to tell . I was troubled with no misgiving that it was young in me to respond to her emotions . I had never laughed and cried in all my life , I dare say -- not even to her -- more freely than I did that morning . ‘
155283	155294	155147	155147	Peggotty	234	’ said Peggotty , wiping her eyes with her apron , ‘
155328	155534	155318	155318	you	0	’ Of course I would . But Peggotty could not get out of the room as easily as she meant to , for as often as she got to the door and looked round at me , she came back again to have another laugh and another cry upon my shoulder . At last , to make the matter easier , I went upstairs with her ; and having waited outside for a minute , while she said a word of preparation to Mr. Barkis , presented myself before that invalid . He received me with absolute enthusiasm . He was too rheumatic to be shaken hands with , but he begged me to shake the tassel on the top of his nightcap , which I did most cordially . When I sat down by the side of the bed , he said that it did him a world of good to feel as if he was driving me on the Blunderstone road again . As he lay in bed , face upward , and so covered , with that exception , that he seemed to be nothing but a face -- like a conventional cherubim -- he looked the queerest object I ever beheld . ‘
155550	155561	155541	155541	I	0	’ said Mr. Barkis , with a slow rheumatic smile . ‘

155605	155613	155615	155616	Mr. Barkis	294	‘ And I do n’t regret it , ’
155618	155641	155615	155616	Mr. Barkis	294	‘ Do you remember what you told me once , about her making all the apple parsties and doing all the cooking ? ’
155642	155648	155649	155649	I	0	‘ Yes , very well , ’
155652	155658	155660	155661	Mr. Barkis	294	‘ It was as true , ’
155663	155673	155675	155676	Mr. Barkis	294	‘ as turnips is . It was as true , ’

Here his right hand came slowly and feebly from under the bedclothes , and with a purposeless uncertain grasp took hold of a stick which was loosely tied to the side of the bed . After some poking about with this instrument , in the course of which his face assumed a variety of distracted expressions , Mr. Barkis poked it against a box , an end of which had been visible to me all the time . Then his face became composed . ‘

155929	155968	155969	155969	She	3420	’ said Mr. Barkis , opening both his eyes as wide as he possibly could . I expressed myself quite sure of that , and Mr. Barkis , turning his eyes more gently to his wife , said : ‘
156023	156062	156063	156063	I	0	’ I should have protested against this unnecessary demonstration in my honour , but that I saw Peggotty , on the opposite side of the bed , extremely anxious I should not . So I held my peace . ‘

157926	157939	157898	157898	you	3462	’ said Mr. Peggotty , sitting down among us by the fire , ‘

157988	158022	157968	157968	sir	979	’ Steerforth only nodded ; but with such a pleased expression of interest , and of participation in Mr. Peggotty ’s feelings , that the latter answered him as if he had spoken . ‘
158027	158032	157968	157968	sir	979	’ said Mr. Peggotty . ‘
158046	158063	158044	158044	sir	979	’ Ham nodded to me several times , as if he would have said so too . ‘
158071	158076	158044	158044	sir	979	’ said Mr. Peggotty , ‘

158144	158149	158151	158151	Steerforth	419	‘ I quite understand , ’
158153	158161	158151	158151	Steerforth	419	‘ I know you do , sir , ’
158166	158222	158224	158225	Mr. Peggotty	234	‘ and thankee again . Mas’r Davy , he can remember what she was ; you may judge for your own self what she is ; but neither of you ca n’t fully know what she has been , is , and will be , to my loving art . I am rough , sir , ’
158227	158268	158224	158225	Mr. Peggotty	234	‘ I am as rough as a Sea Porkypine ; but no one , unless , mayhap , it is a woman , can know , I think , what our little Em’ly is to me . And betwixt ourselves , ’
158275	158294	158270	158270	his	234	‘ that woman ’s name ai n’t Missis Gummidge neither , though she has a world of merits . ’
158331	158383	158385	158386	Mr. Peggotty	234	‘ There was a certain person as had know’d our Em’ly , from the time when her father was drownded ; as had seen her constant ; when a babby , when a young gal , when a woman . Not much of a person to look at , he warn’t , ’
158388	158391	158385	158386	Mr. Peggotty	234	‘ something o ’
158402	158432	158433	158433	I	0	’ the sou’-wester in him -- wery salt -- but , on the whole , a honest sort of a chap , with his art in the right place . ’
158455	158466	158468	158469	Mr. Peggotty	234	‘ What does this here blessed tarpaulin go and do , ’
158480	158505	158472	158472	his	234	‘ but he loses that there art of his to our little Em’ly . He follers her about , he makes hisself a sort o ’
158692	158739	158742	158742	I	0	’ Mr. Peggotty , in simple earnestness , waved his right arm , as if he were waving it at the town - lights for the last time , and then , exchanging a nod with Ham , whose eye he caught , proceeded as before . ‘
158838	158845	158851	158851	you	262	’re right to speak out , you ’re
158852	158960	158851	158851	you	262	’re as free as a little bird . ” Then I aways to him , and I says , “ I wish it could have been so , but it ca n’t . But you can both be as you was , and wot I say to you is , Be as you was with her , like a man . ” He says to me , a - shaking of my hand , “ I will ! ” he says . And he was -- honourable and manful -- for two year going on , and we was just the same at home here as afore . ’
159025	159156	159158	159159	Mr. Peggotty	234	‘ All of a sudden , one evening -- as it might be tonight -- comes little Em’ly from her work , and him with her ! There ai n’t so much in that , you ’ll say . No , because he takes care on her , like a brother , arter dark , and indeed afore dark , and at all times . But this tarpaulin chap , he takes hold of her hand , and he cries out to me , joyful , “ Look here ! This is to be my little wife ! ” And she says , half bold and half shy , and half a laughing and half a crying , “ Yes , Uncle ! If you please . ”--If I please ! ’
159171	159246	159248	159249	Mr. Peggotty--‘You	428	‘ Lord , as if I should do anythink else!--“If you please , I am steadier now , and I have thought better of it , and I ’ll be as good a little wife as I can to him , for he ’s a dear , good fellow ! ” Then Missis Gummidge , she claps her hands like a play , and you come in . Theer ! the murder ’s out ! ’
159280	159329	159330	159330	She	3484	’ Ham staggered , as well he might , under the blow Mr. Peggotty dealt him in his unbounded joy , as a mark of confidence and friendship ; but feeling called upon to say something to us , he said , with much faltering and great difficulty : ‘
159473	159675	159461	159463	a common man	3490	’ I thought it affecting to see such a sturdy fellow as Ham was now , trembling in the strength of what he felt for the pretty little creature who had won his heart . I thought the simple confidence reposed in us by Mr. Peggotty and by himself , was , in itself , affecting . I was affected by the story altogether . How far my emotions were influenced by the recollections of my childhood , I do n’t know . Whether I had come there with any lingering fancy that I was still to love little Em’ly , I do n’t know . I know that I was filled with pleasure by all this ; but , at first , with an indescribably sensitive pleasure , that a very little would have changed to pain . Therefore , if it had depended upon me to touch the prevailing chord among them with any skill , I should have made a poor hand of it . But it depended upon Steerforth ; and he did it with such address , that in a few minutes we were all as easy and as happy as it was possible to be . ‘
159679	159683	159461	159463	a common man	3490	’ he said , ‘
159796	160106	159784	159784	I	0	’ So Mr. Peggotty went into my old room to fetch little Em’ly . At first little Em’ly did n’t like to come , and then Ham went . Presently they brought her to the fireside , very much confused , and very shy,--but she soon became more assured when she found how gently and respectfully Steerforth spoke to her ; how skilfully he avoided anything that would embarrass her ; how he talked to Mr. Peggotty of boats , and ships , and tides , and fish ; how he referred to me about the time when he had seen Mr. Peggotty at Salem House ; how delighted he was with the boat and all belonging to it ; how lightly and easily he carried on , until he brought us , by degrees , into a charmed circle , and we were all talking away without any reserve . Em’ly , indeed , said little all the evening ; but she looked , and listened , and her face got animated , and she was charming . Steerforth told a story of a dismal shipwreck ( which arose out of his talk with Mr. Peggotty ) , as if he saw it all before him -- and little Em’ly ’s eyes were fastened on him all the time , as if she saw it too . He told us a merry adventure of his own , as a relief to that , with as much gaiety as if the narrative were as fresh to him as it was to us -- and little Em’ly laughed until the boat rang with the musical sounds , and we all laughed ( Steerforth too ) , in irresistible sympathy with what was so pleasant and light - hearted . He got Mr. Peggotty to sing , or rather to roar , ‘
160119	160523	160524	160528	A most engaging little Beauty	3495	’ ; and he sang a sailor ’s song himself , so pathetically and beautifully , that I could have almost fancied that the real wind creeping sorrowfully round the house , and murmuring low through our unbroken silence , was there to listen . As to Mrs. Gummidge , he roused that victim of despondency with a success never attained by anyone else ( so Mr. Peggotty informed me ) , since the decease of the old one . He left her so little leisure for being miserable , that she said next day she thought she must have been bewitched . But he set up no monopoly of the general attention , or the conversation . When little Em’ly grew more courageous , and talked ( but still bashfully ) across the fire to me , of our old wanderings upon the beach , to pick up shells and pebbles ; and when I asked her if she recollected how I used to be devoted to her ; and when we both laughed and reddened , casting these looks back on the pleasant old times , so unreal to look at now ; he was silent and attentive , and observed us thoughtfully . She sat , at this time , and all the evening , on the old locker in her old little corner by the fire -- Ham beside her , where I used to sit . I could not satisfy myself whether it was in her own little tormenting way , or in a maidenly reserve before us , that she kept quite close to the wall , and away from him ; but I observed that she did so , all the evening . As I remember , it was almost midnight when we took our leave . We had had some biscuit and dried fish for supper , and Steerforth had produced from his pocket a full flask of Hollands , which we men ( I may say we men , now , without a blush ) had emptied . We parted merrily ; and as they all stood crowded round the door to light us as far as they could upon our road , I saw the sweet blue eyes of little Em’ly peeping after us , from behind Ham , and heard her soft voice calling to us to be careful how we went . ‘
160530	160538	160524	160528	A most engaging little Beauty	3495	’ said Steerforth , taking my arm . ‘
160565	160566	160524	160528	A most engaging little Beauty	3495	’ ‘
160574	160578	160524	160528	A most engaging little Beauty	3495	’ I returned , ‘
160620	160621	160625	160629	a chuckle - headed fellow	3502	’ ‘
160638	160687	160636	160636	he	3502	’ said Steerforth . He had been so hearty with him , and with them all , that I felt a shock in this unexpected and cold reply . But turning quickly upon him , and seeing a laugh in his eyes , I answered , much relieved : ‘
160800	160813	160814	160814	Daisy	417	’ He stopped , and , looking in my face , said , ‘
160833	161028	161029	161031	The Willing Mind	270	’ Next moment he was gaily singing Mr. Peggotty ’s song , as we walked at a round pace back to Yarmouth . CHAPTER 22 . SOME OLD SCENES , AND SOME NEW PEOPLE Steerforth and I stayed for more than a fortnight in that part of the country . We were very much together , I need not say ; but occasionally we were asunder for some hours at a time . He was a good sailor , and I was but an indifferent one ; and when he went out boating with Mr. Peggotty , which was a favourite amusement of his , I generally remained ashore . My occupation of Peggotty ’s spare - room put a constraint upon me , from which he was free : for , knowing how assiduously she attended on Mr. Barkis all day , I did not like to remain out late at night ; whereas Steerforth , lying at the Inn , had nothing to consult but his own humour . Thus it came about , that I heard of his making little treats for the fishermen at Mr. Peggotty ’s house of call , ‘
161032	162166	162167	162167	You	3509	’ , after I was in bed , and of his being afloat , wrapped in fishermen ’s clothes , whole moonlight nights , and coming back when the morning tide was at flood . By this time , however , I knew that his restless nature and bold spirits delighted to find a vent in rough toil and hard weather , as in any other means of excitement that presented itself freshly to him ; so none of his proceedings surprised me . Another cause of our being sometimes apart , was , that I had naturally an interest in going over to Blunderstone , and revisiting the old familiar scenes of my childhood ; while Steerforth , after being there once , had naturally no great interest in going there again . Hence , on three or four days that I can at once recall , we went our several ways after an early breakfast , and met again at a late dinner . I had no idea how he employed his time in the interval , beyond a general knowledge that he was very popular in the place , and had twenty means of actively diverting himself where another man might not have found one . For my own part , my occupation in my solitary pilgrimages was to recall every yard of the old road as I went along it , and to haunt the old spots , of which I never tired . I haunted them , as my memory had often done , and lingered among them as my younger thoughts had lingered when I was far away . The grave beneath the tree , where both my parents lay -- on which I had looked out , when it was my father ’s only , with such curious feelings of compassion , and by which I had stood , so desolate , when it was opened to receive my pretty mother and her baby -- the grave which Peggotty ’s own faithful care had ever since kept neat , and made a garden of , I walked near , by the hour . It lay a little off the churchyard path , in a quiet corner , not so far removed but I could read the names upon the stone as I walked to and fro , startled by the sound of the church - bell when it struck the hour , for it was like a departed voice to me . My reflections at these times were always associated with the figure I was to make in life , and the distinguished things I was to do . My echoing footsteps went to no other tune , but were as constant to that as if I had come home to build my castles in the air at a living mother ’s side . There were great changes in my old home . The ragged nests , so long deserted by the rooks , were gone ; and the trees were lopped and topped out of their remembered shapes . The garden had run wild , and half the windows of the house were shut up . It was occupied , but only by a poor lunatic gentleman , and the people who took care of him . He was always sitting at my little window , looking out into the churchyard ; and I wondered whether his rambling thoughts ever went upon any of the fancies that used to occupy mine , on the rosy mornings when I peeped out of that same little window in my night - clothes , and saw the sheep quietly feeding in the light of the rising sun . Our old neighbours , Mr. and Mrs. Grayper , were gone to South America , and the rain had made its way through the roof of their empty house , and stained the outer walls . Mr. Chillip was married again to a tall , raw - boned , high - nosed wife ; and they had a weazen little baby , with a heavy head that it could n’t hold up , and two weak staring eyes , with which it seemed to be always wondering why it had ever been born . It was with a singular jumble of sadness and pleasure that I used to linger about my native place , until the reddening winter sun admonished me that it was time to start on my returning walk . But , when the place was left behind , and especially when Steerforth and I were happily seated over our dinner by a blazing fire , it was delicious to think of having been there . So it was , though in a softened degree , when I went to my neat room at night ; and , turning over the leaves of the crocodile - book ( which was always there , upon a little table ) , remembered with a grateful heart how blest I was in having such a friend as Steerforth , such a friend as Peggotty , and such a substitute for what I had lost as my excellent and generous aunt . My nearest way to Yarmouth , in coming back from these long walks , was by a ferry . It landed me on the flat between the town and the sea , which I could make straight across , and so save myself a considerable circuit by the high road . Mr. Peggotty ’s house being on that waste - place , and not a hundred yards out of my track , I always looked in as I went by . Steerforth was pretty sure to be there expecting me , and we went on together through the frosty air and gathering fog towards the twinkling lights of the town . One dark evening , when I was later than usual -- for I had , that day , been making my parting visit to Blunderstone , as we were now about to return home -- I found him alone in Mr. Peggotty ’s house , sitting thoughtfully before the fire . He was so intent upon his own reflections that he was quite unconscious of my approach . This , indeed , he might easily have been if he had been less absorbed , for footsteps fell noiselessly on the sandy ground outside ; but even my entrance failed to rouse him . I was standing close to him , looking at him ; and still , with a heavy brow , he was lost in his meditations . He gave such a start when I put my hand upon his shoulder , that he made me start too . ‘
162172	162179	162167	162167	You	3509	’ he said , almost angrily , ‘
162185	162186	162167	162167	You	3509	’ ‘

162229	162239	162202	162202	I	0	’ said I , taking my seat near him . ‘
162250	162254	162240	162240	I	0	’ he returned . ‘
162263	162305	162256	162256	you	0	’ said I , as he stirred it quickly with a piece of burning wood , striking out of it a train of red - hot sparks that went careering up the little chimney , and roaring out into the air . ‘
162313	162317	162306	162306	You	3509	’ he returned . ‘
162339	162340	162336	162336	you	3509	’ ‘
162351	162354	162341	162341	I	0	’ said I. ‘
162362	162371	162356	162356	I	0	’ said Steerforth , glancing round the room , ‘

162477	162503	162465	162465	I	0	’ There was a passionate dejection in his manner that quite amazed me . He was more unlike himself than I could have supposed possible . ‘
162521	162543	162465	162465	I	0	’ he said , getting up and leaning moodily against the chimney - piece , with his face towards the fire , ‘
162584	162687	162694	162694	Daisy	417	’ I was so confounded by the alteration in him , that at first I could only observe him in silence , as he stood leaning his head upon his hand , and looking gloomily down at the fire . At length I begged him , with all the earnestness I felt , to tell me what had occurred to cross him so unusually , and to let me sympathize with him , if I could not hope to advise him . Before I had well concluded , he began to laugh -- fretfully at first , but soon with returning gaiety . ‘
162698	162702	162703	162703	I	0	’ he replied . ‘
162819	162820	162812	162812	I	0	’ ‘

162909	162945	162873	162873	I	0	’ His face was always full of expression , but I never saw it express such a dark kind of earnestness as when he said these words , with his glance bent on the fire . ‘
162951	162971	162873	162873	I	0	’ he said , making as if he tossed something light into the air , with his hand . “ ‘

163023	163026	163020	163020	I	0	’ said I. ‘

163065	163200	163060	163060	you	3528	’ The advent of Mrs. Gummidge with a basket , explained how the house had happened to be empty . She had hurried out to buy something that was needed , against Mr. Peggotty ’s return with the tide ; and had left the door open in the meanwhile , lest Ham and little Em’ly , with whom it was an early night , should come home while she was gone . Steerforth , after very much improving Mrs. Gummidge ’s spirits by a cheerful salutation and a jocose embrace , took my arm , and hurried me away . He had improved his own spirits , no less than Mrs. Gummidge ’s , for they were again at their usual flow , and he was full of vivacious conversation as we went along . ‘
163204	163210	163060	163060	you	3528	’ he said , gaily , ‘

163787	163791	163792	163792	you	0	’ he answered , ‘
163808	163844	163803	163803	We	3550	’ Afraid of offending him by pursuing the subject when he made so light of it , I only pursued it in my thoughts as we went on at even a quicker pace than before . ‘
163851	163855	163803	163803	We	3550	’ said Steerforth , ‘
163885	163886	163877	163877	I	0	’ ‘
163889	163890	163877	163877	I	0	’ ‘
163906	163967	163903	163904	my mother	740	’ As our looks met , I observed that he was pale even to his lips , though he looked very steadily at me . I feared that some difference between him and his mother might have led to his being in the frame of mind in which I had found him at the solitary fireside . I hinted so . ‘
163971	163985	163903	163904	my mother	740	’ he said , shaking his head , and giving a slight laugh . ‘
164003	164004	163993	163993	He	420	’ ‘
164010	164013	163993	163993	He	420	’ said I. ‘
164019	164023	163993	163993	He	420	’ said Steerforth . ‘
164067	164068	164060	164060	I	0	’ ‘
164073	164077	164060	164060	I	0	’ I asked . ‘
164084	164141	164060	164060	I	0	’ As he had continued to look steadily at me , I took it as a reminder that he objected to being extolled for his consideration . I could not help showing in my face how much it pleased me , but I said little , and he resumed his usual smile , and seemed relieved . ‘
164146	164154	164156	164159	the original little Em’ly	3557	’ he said , looking before us , ‘
164185	164523	164180	164180	He	3558	’ Ham was a boat - builder in these days , having improved a natural ingenuity in that handicraft , until he had become a skilled workman . He was in his working - dress , and looked rugged enough , but manly withal , and a very fit protector for the blooming little creature at his side . Indeed , there was a frankness in his face , an honesty , and an undisguised show of his pride in her , and his love for her , which were , to me , the best of good looks . I thought , as they came towards us , that they were well matched even in that particular . She withdrew her hand timidly from his arm as we stopped to speak to them , and blushed as she gave it to Steerforth and to me . When they passed on , after we had exchanged a few words , she did not like to replace that hand , but , still appearing timid and constrained , walked by herself . I thought all this very pretty and engaging , and Steerforth seemed to think so too , as we looked after them fading away in the light of a young moon . Suddenly there passed us -- evidently following them -- a young woman whose approach we had not observed , but whose face I saw as she went by , and thought I had a faint remembrance of . She was lightly dressed ; looked bold , and haggard , and flaunting , and poor ; but seemed , for the time , to have given all that to the wind which was blowing , and to have nothing in her mind but going after them . As the dark distant level , absorbing their figures into itself , left but itself visible between us and the sea and clouds , her figure disappeared in like manner , still no nearer to them than before . ‘
164535	164542	164180	164180	He	3558	’ said Steerforth , standing still ; ‘
164548	164562	164563	164563	She	11419	’ He spoke in a low voice that sounded almost strange to Me . ‘
164578	164581	164575	164575	I	0	’ said I. ‘
164589	164593	164575	164575	I	0	’ said Steerforth ; ‘
164609	164610	164601	164602	the beggar	3564	’ ‘
164613	164617	164601	164602	the beggar	3564	’ I asked . ‘
164631	164639	164627	164627	I	0	’ he said , after a pause , ‘
164661	164662	164651	164652	the Devil	10340	’ ‘
164673	164689	164670	164670	I	0	’ said I , as we emerged upon a road on which a wall abutted . ‘
164694	164703	164670	164670	I	0	’ he returned , looking over his shoulder . ‘
164716	164858	164859	164859	You	3567	’ But he looked again over his shoulder towards the sea - line glimmering afar off , and yet again . And he wondered about it , in some broken expressions , several times , in the short remainder of our walk ; and only seemed to forget it when the light of fire and candle shone upon us , seated warm and merry , at table . Littimer was there , and had his usual effect upon me . When I said to him that I hoped Mrs. Steerforth and Miss Dartle were well , he answered respectfully ( and of course respectably ) , that they were tolerably well , he thanked me , and had sent their compliments . This was all , and yet he seemed to me to say as plainly as a man could say : ‘
164871	164913	164866	164866	you	3567	’ We had almost finished dinner , when taking a step or two towards the table , from the corner where he kept watch upon us , or rather upon me , as I felt , he said to his master : ‘
164927	164928	164921	164922	Miss Mowcher	433	’ ‘
164931	164938	164939	164940	Miss Mowcher	433	’ cried Steerforth , much astonished . ‘
164944	164945	164939	164940	Miss Mowcher	433	’ ‘
164956	164960	164952	164952	she	433	’ said Steerforth . ‘
165021	165022	165002	165002	she	433	’ ‘
165033	165065	165031	165031	Daisy	417	’ inquired Steerforth . I was obliged to confess -- I felt ashamed , even of being at this disadvantage before Littimer -- that Miss Mowcher and I were wholly unacquainted . ‘
165072	165076	165067	165067	you	979	’ said Steerforth , ‘
165098	165191	165090	165091	Miss Mowcher	433	’ I felt some curiosity and excitement about this lady , especially as Steerforth burst into a fit of laughing when I referred to her , and positively refused to answer any question of which I made her the subject . I remained , therefore , in a state of considerable expectation until the cloth had been removed some half an hour , and we were sitting over our decanter of wine before the fire , when the door opened , and Littimer , with his habitual serenity quite undisturbed , announced : ‘
165195	165501	165192	165193	Miss Mowcher	433	’ I looked at the doorway and saw nothing . I was still looking at the doorway , thinking that Miss Mowcher was a long while making her appearance , when , to my infinite astonishment , there came waddling round a sofa which stood between me and it , a pursy dwarf , of about forty or forty - five , with a very large head and face , a pair of roguish grey eyes , and such extremely little arms , that , to enable herself to lay a finger archly against her snub nose , as she ogled Steerforth , she was obliged to meet the finger half - way , and lay her nose against it . Her chin , which was what is called a double chin , was so fat that it entirely swallowed up the strings of her bonnet , bow and all . Throat she had none ; waist she had none ; legs she had none , worth mentioning ; for though she was more than full - sized down to where her waist would have been , if she had had any , and though she terminated , as human beings generally do , in a pair of feet , she was so short that she stood at a common - sized chair as at a table , resting a bag she carried on the seat . This lady -- dressed in an off - hand , easy style ; bringing her nose and her forefinger together , with the difficulty I have described ; standing with her head necessarily on one side , and , with one of her sharp eyes shut up , making an uncommonly knowing face -- after ogling Steerforth for a few moments , broke into a torrent of words . ‘
165507	165519	165520	165520	You	3581	’ she pleasantly began , shaking her large head at him . ‘
165521	165559	165520	165520	You	3581	’re there , are you ! Oh , you naughty boy , fie for shame , what do you do so far away from home ? Up to mischief , I ’ll be bound . Oh , you ’re
165572	165617	165520	165520	You	3581	’m another , ai n’t I ? Ha , ha , ha ! You ’d have betted a hundred pound to five , now , that you would n’t have seen me here , would n’t you ? Bless you , man alive , I ’m
165621	165683	165620	165620	I	0	’m here and there , and where not , like the conjurer ’s half - crown in the lady ’s handkercher . Talking of handkerchers -- and talking of ladies -- what a comfort you are to your blessed mother , ai n’t you , my dear boy , over one of my shoulders , and I do n’t say which ! ’
165736	165747	165748	165748	she	433	‘ Oh my stars and what’s - their - names ! ’
165768	165770	165748	165748	she	433	‘ I ’m
165836	165837	165834	165834	you	0	’ ‘
165848	165852	165844	165844	I	0	’ replied Steerforth . ‘
165861	165883	165844	165844	I	0	’ cried the little creature , making a whisk at him with the handkerchief with which she was wiping her face , ‘
165908	165929	165952	165952	he	8584	’S a woman ! How SHE wears!--and Mithers himself came into the room where I was waiting for her -- THERE ’S
165994	165995	165990	165990	he	8584	’ ‘
166004	166008	165998	165998	you	0	’ asked Steerforth . ‘
166017	166042	165998	165998	you	0	’ she retorted , tapping her nose again , screwing up her face , and twinkling her eyes like an imp of supernatural intelligence . ‘
166104	166105	166094	166094	you	3587	’ ‘
166108	166112	166094	166094	you	3587	’ said Steerforth . ‘
166121	166126	166115	166115	Walker	338	’ replied Miss Mowcher , ‘
166146	166329	166128	166128	he	338	’ I never beheld anything approaching to Miss Mowcher ’s wink except Miss Mowcher ’s self - possession . She had a wonderful way too , when listening to what was said to her , or when waiting for an answer to what she had said herself , of pausing with her head cunningly on one side , and one eye turned up like a magpie ’s . Altogether I was lost in amazement , and sat staring at her , quite oblivious , I am afraid , of the laws of politeness . She had by this time drawn the chair to her side , and was busily engaged in producing from the bag ( plunging in her short arm to the shoulder , at every dive ) a number of small bottles , sponges , combs , brushes , bits of flannel , little pairs of curling - irons , and other instruments , which she tumbled in a heap upon the chair . From this employment she suddenly desisted , and said to Steerforth , much to my confusion : ‘
166335	166336	166337	166338	Mr. Copperfield	232	’ ‘
166340	166344	166345	166345	he	232	’ said Steerforth ; ‘
166351	166352	166345	166345	he	232	’ ‘
166369	166391	166366	166366	he	232	’ returned Miss Mowcher , waddling up to me , bag in hand , and laughing on me as she came . ‘
166397	166409	166366	166366	he	232	’ standing on tiptoe to pinch my cheek as I sat . ‘
166414	166430	166357	166357	he	232	’m very fond of peaches . Happy to make your acquaintance , Mr. Copperfield , I ’m
166433	166455	166413	166413	I	0	’ I said that I congratulated myself on having the honour to make hers , and that the happiness was mutual . ‘
166466	166487	166413	166413	I	0	’ exclaimed Miss Mowcher , making a preposterous attempt to cover her large face with her morsel of a hand . ‘
166504	166539	166542	166542	you	0	’ This was addressed confidentially to both of us , as the morsel of a hand came away from the face , and buried itself , arm and all , in the bag again . ‘
166548	166552	166542	166542	you	0	’ said Steerforth . ‘
166580	166605	166576	166578	my sweet child	3594	’ replied that morsel of a woman , feeling in the bag with her head on one side and her eye in the air . ‘
166609	166614	166617	166619	the Russian Prince	3595	’ taking something out . ‘
166649	166650	166630	166630	I	0	’ ‘
166663	166667	166661	166661	he	3595	’ said Steerforth . ‘
166675	166680	166670	166670	you	0	’ replied Miss Mowcher . ‘
166698	166699	166700	166700	He	3595	’ ‘
166707	166711	166715	166715	he	3595	’ said Steerforth . ‘
166726	166731	166715	166715	he	3595	’ replied Miss Mowcher . ‘
166761	166762	166764	166764	your	0	’ ‘
166770	166779	166764	166764	your	0	’ said Steerforth . Miss Mowcher winked assent . ‘
166831	166832	166814	166817	such a rusty Prince	3601	’ ‘
166845	166849	166836	166836	you	0	’ inquired Steerforth . ‘
166853	166864	166870	166870	her	433	’re a broth of a boy , ai n’t you ? ’
166874	166929	166870	166870	her	433	‘ I said , what a set of humbugs we were in general , and I showed you the scraps of the Prince ’s nails to prove it . The Prince ’s nails do more for me in private families of the genteel sort , than all my talents put together . I always carry ‘
166934	166956	166866	166867	Miss Mowcher	433	’re the best introduction . If Miss Mowcher cuts the Prince ’s nails , she must be all right . I give ‘
166966	167011	167016	167016	women	10147	‘ em in albums , I believe . Ha ! ha ! ha ! Upon my life , “ the whole social system ” ( as the men call it when they make speeches in Parliament ) is a system of Prince ’s nails ! ’
167077	167082	167083	167083	she	433	‘ Well , well ! ’
167094	167116	167083	167083	she	433	‘ this is not business . Come , Steerforth , let ’s explore the polar regions , and have it over . ’
167186	167195	167196	167196	she	433	‘ If either of you saw my ankles , ’
167205	167218	167196	167196	she	433	‘ say so , and I ’ll go home and destroy myself ! ’
167219	167224	167226	167226	Steerforth	419	‘ I did not , ’
167228	167233	167235	167235	I.	0	‘ I did not , ’
167236	167240	167242	167243	Miss Mowcher	433	‘ Well then , ’
167245	167268	167242	167243	Miss Mowcher	433	‘ I ’ll consent to live . Now , ducky , ducky , ducky , come to Mrs. Bond and be killed . ’
167358	167360	167345	167345	she	433	‘ You ’re
167365	167375	167345	167345	she	433	’ said Miss Mowcher , after a brief inspection . ‘
167426	167495	167513	167513	Charley	438	’ With this , she tilted some of the contents of the little bottle on to one of the little bits of flannel , and , again imparting some of the virtues of that preparation to one of the little brushes , began rubbing and scraping away with both on the crown of Steerforth ’s head in the busiest manner I ever witnessed , talking all the time . ‘
167506	167510	167498	167499	Charley Pyegrave	438	’ she said . ‘
167515	167522	167513	167513	Charley	438	’ peeping round into his face . ‘
167526	167530	167513	167513	Charley	438	’ said Steerforth . ‘
167538	167584	167513	167513	Charley	438	’S a whisker ! As to Charley ’s legs , if they were only a pair ( which they ai n’t ) , they ’d defy competition . Would you believe he tried to do without me -- in the Life - Guards , too ? ’
167585	167588	167590	167590	Steerforth	419	‘ Mad ! ’
167592	167607	167590	167590	Steerforth	419	‘ It looks like it . However , mad or sane , he tried , ’
167612	167644	167609	167610	Miss Mowcher	433	‘ What does he do , but , lo and behold you , he goes into a perfumer ’s shop , and wants to buy a bottle of the Madagascar Liquid . ’
167645	167649	167651	167651	Steerforth	419	‘ Charley does ? ’
167653	167668	167651	167651	Steerforth	419	‘ Charley does . But they have n’t got any of the Madagascar Liquid . ’
167669	167678	167680	167680	Steerforth	419	‘ What is it ? Something to drink ? ’
167682	167686	167680	167680	Steerforth	419	‘ To drink ? ’
167697	167822	167824	167825	Miss Mowcher	433	‘ To doctor his own moustachios with , you know . There was a woman in the shop -- elderly female -- quite a Griffin -- who had never even heard of it by name . “ Begging pardon , sir , ” said the Griffin to Charley , “ it ’s not -- not -- not ROUGE , is it ? ” “ Rouge , ” said Charley to the Griffin . “ What the unmentionable to ears polite , do you think I want with rouge ? ” “ No offence , sir , ” said the Griffin ; “ we have it asked for by so many names , I thought it might be . ” Now that , my child , ’
167836	167878	167824	167825	Miss Mowcher	433	‘ is another instance of the refreshing humbug I was speaking of . I do something in that way myself -- perhaps a good deal -- perhaps a little -- sharp ’s the word , my dear boy -- never mind ! ’
167879	167892	167894	167894	Steerforth	419	‘ In what way do you mean ? In the rouge way ? ’
167896	167907	167894	167894	Steerforth	419	‘ Put this and that together , my tender pupil , ’
167917	167996	167997	167997	em	3614	‘ work it by the rule of Secrets in all trades , and the product will give you the desired result . I say I do a little in that way myself .

168138	168169	168135	168135	she	433	‘ Such things are not much in demand hereabouts . That sets me off again ! I have n’t seen a pretty woman since I ’ve been here , jemmy . ’

168177	168184	168186	168187	Miss Mowcher	433	‘ Not the ghost of one , ’
168189	168202	168204	168204	Steerforth	419	‘ We could show her the substance of one , I think ? ’
168212	168217	168204	168204	Steerforth	419	‘ Eh , Daisy ? ’

168544	168593	168529	168529	I	0	‘ She is as virtuous as she is pretty . She is engaged to be married to a most worthy and deserving man in her own station of life . I esteem her for her good sense , as much as I admire her for her good looks . ’
168594	168598	168600	168600	Steerforth	419	‘ Well said ! ’
168602	168819	168600	168600	Steerforth	419	‘ Hear , hear , hear ! Now I ’ll quench the curiosity of this little Fatima , my dear Daisy , by leaving her nothing to guess at . She is at present apprenticed , Miss Mowcher , or articled , or whatever it may be , to Omer and Joram , Haberdashers , Milliners , and so forth , in this town . Do you observe ? Omer and Joram . The promise of which my friend has spoken , is made and entered into with her cousin ; Christian name , Ham ; surname , Peggotty ; occupation , boat - builder ; also of this town . She lives with a relative ; Christian name , unknown ; surname , Peggotty ; occupation , seafaring ; also of this town . She is the prettiest and most engaging little fairy in the world . I admire her -- as my friend does -- exceedingly . If it were not that I might appear to disparage her Intended , which I know my friend would not like , I would add , that to me she seems to be throwing herself away ; that I am sure she might do better ; and that I swear she was born to be a lady . ’
168876	168889	168890	168890	she	433	‘ Oh ! And that ’s all about it , is it ? ’
168914	169019	168890	168890	she	433	‘ Very well : very well ! Quite a long story . Ought to end “ and they lived happy ever afterwards ” ; ought n’t it ? Ah ! What ’s that game at forfeits ? I love my love with an E , because she ’s enticing ; I hate her with an E , because she ’s engaged . I took her to the sign of the exquisite , and treated her with an elopement , her name ’s Emily , and she lives in the east ? Ha ! ha ! ha ! Mr. Copperfield , ai n’t I volatile ? ’
169042	169092	169035	169035	she	433	‘ There ! If ever any scapegrace was trimmed and touched up to perfection , you are , Steerforth . If I understand any noddle in the world , I understand yours . Do you hear me when I tell you that , my darling ? I understand yours , ’
169099	169128	169035	169035	she	433	‘ Now you may mizzle , jemmy ( as we say at Court ) , and if Mr. Copperfield will take the chair I ’ll operate on him . ’

169423	169439	169420	169421	Miss Mowcher	433	‘ and dirt cheap , my chicken . Ai n’t I volatile , Mr. Copperfield ? ’
169444	169449	169440	169440	I	0	‘ Not at all . ’
169488	169494	169496	169497	Miss Mowcher	433	‘ That ’s the Till ! ’
169523	169590	169516	169516	she	433	‘ Have I got all my traps ? It seems so . It wo n’t do to be like long Ned Beadwood , when they took him to church “ to marry him to somebody ” , as he says , and left the bride behind . Ha ! ha ! ha ! A wicked rascal , Ned , but droll ! Now , I know I ’m

169733	170033	170034	170034	Bob	441	’ she added , as a commentary on this offer , and , with her finger on her nose , departed . Steerforth laughed to that degree , that it was impossible for me to help laughing too ; though I am not sure I should have done so , but for this inducement . When we had had our laugh quite out , which was after some time , he told me that Miss Mowcher had quite an extensive connexion , and made herself useful to a variety of people in a variety of ways . Some people trifled with her as a mere oddity , he said ; but she was as shrewdly and sharply observant as anyone he knew , and as long - headed as she was short - armed . He told me that what she had said of being here , and there , and everywhere , was true enough ; for she made little darts into the provinces , and seemed to pick up customers everywhere , and to know everybody . I asked him what her disposition was : whether it was at all mischievous , and if her sympathies were generally on the right side of things : but , not succeeding in attracting his attention to these questions after two or three attempts , I forbore or forgot to repeat them . He told me instead , with much rapidity , a good deal about her skill , and her profits ; and about her being a scientific cupper , if I should ever have occasion for her service in that capacity . She was the principal theme of our conversation during the evening : and when we parted for the night Steerforth called after me over the banisters , ‘
170037	170100	170034	170034	Bob	441	’ as I went downstairs . I was surprised , when I came to Mr. Barkis ’s house , to find Ham walking up and down in front of it , and still more surprised to learn from him that little Em’ly was inside . I naturally inquired why he was not there too , instead of pacing the streets by himself ? ‘
170109	170118	170119	170119	Em’ly	256	’ he rejoined , in a hesitating manner , ‘

170144	170159	170140	170140	I	0	‘ that that was a reason for your being in here too , Ham . ’
170160	170172	170121	170121	she	3634	‘ Well , Mas’r Davy , in a general way , so ‘

170320	170326	170328	170328	Ham	236	‘ Keeping us in sight ? ’
170330	170411	170328	170328	Ham	236	‘ It ’s like you did , Mas’r Davy . Not that I know’d then , she was theer , sir , but along of her creeping soon arterwards under Em’ly ’s little winder , when she see the light come , and whispering “ Em’ly , Em’ly , for Christ ’s sake , have a woman ’s heart towards me . I was once like you ! ” Those was solemn words , Mas’r Davy , fur to hear ! ’

170425	170460	170328	170328	Ham	236	‘ Says Em’ly , “ Martha , is it you ? Oh , Martha , can it be you?”--for they had sat at work together , many a day , at Mr. Omer ’s . ’

170530	170539	170529	170529	I.	0	‘ I did n’t mean to interrupt you . ’

What can I do ? She doen’t ought to know any such , but I ca n’t deny her , when the tears is on her face . ’

When we came to our journey ’s end , he went home , engaging to call upon me next day but one ; and I drove to Lincoln ’s Inn Fields , where I found my aunt up , and waiting supper . If I had been round the world since we parted , we could hardly have been better pleased to meet again . My aunt cried outright as she embraced me ; and said , pretending to laugh , that if my poor mother had been alive , that silly little creature would have shed tears , she had no doubt . ‘

174726	174741	174719	174719	I	0	’ I tried to comfort her on this point , but she rejected consolation . ‘
174747	174752	174719	174719	I	0	’ said my aunt ; ‘
174778	174796	174772	174772	she	9509	’ This had been , ever since , the only name my aunt knew for Miss Murdstone . ‘
174820	174829	174772	174772	she	9509	’ said my aunt , striking the table , ‘
174834	174978	174979	174979	I	0	’ Janet ventured to suggest that my aunt might be disturbing herself unnecessarily , and that she believed the donkey in question was then engaged in the sand - and - gravel line of business , and was not available for purposes of trespass . But my aunt would n’t hear of it . Supper was comfortably served and hot , though my aunt ’s rooms were very high up -- whether that she might have more stone stairs for her money , or might be nearer to the door in the roof , I do n’t know -- and consisted of a roast fowl , a steak , and some vegetables , to all of which I did ample justice , and which were all excellent . But my aunt had her own ideas concerning London provision , and ate but little . ‘
174993	174998	174981	174983	this unfortunate fowl	3749	’ said my aunt , ‘

175094	175150	175089	175089	he	3755	’ I did not venture to controvert this opinion , but I made a good supper , which it greatly satisfied her to see me do . When the table was cleared , Janet assisted her to arrange her hair , to put on her nightcap , which was of a smarter construction than usual ( ‘
175155	175281	175293	175293	you	3756	’ , my aunt said ) , and to fold her gown back over her knees , these being her usual preparations for warming herself before going to bed . I then made her , according to certain established regulations from which no deviation , however slight , could ever be permitted , a glass of hot wine and water , and a slice of toast cut into long thin strips . With these accompaniments we were left alone to finish the evening , my aunt sitting opposite to me drinking her wine and water ; soaking her strips of toast in it , one by one , before eating them ; and looking benignantly on me , from among the borders of her nightcap . ‘

176934	177065	177066	177067	Mr. Spenlow	447	’ Commons was approached by a little low archway . Before we had taken many paces down the street beyond it , the noise of the city seemed to melt , as if by magic , into a softened distance . A few dull courts and narrow ways brought us to the sky - lighted offices of Spenlow and Jorkins ; in the vestibule of which temple , accessible to pilgrims without the ceremony of knocking , three or four clerks were at work as copyists . One of these , a little dry man , sitting by himself , who wore a stiff brown wig that looked as if it were made of gingerbread , rose to receive my aunt , and show us into Mr. Spenlow ’s room . ‘
177074	177080	177066	177067	Mr. Spenlow	447	’ said the dry man ; ‘
177101	177225	177094	177094	I	0	’ As we were left to look about us while Mr. Spenlow was fetched , I availed myself of the opportunity . The furniture of the room was old - fashioned and dusty ; and the green baize on the top of the writing - table had lost all its colour , and was as withered and pale as an old pauper . There were a great many bundles of papers on it , some endorsed as Allegations , and some ( to my surprise ) as Libels , and some as being in the Consistory Court , and some in the Arches Court , and some in the Prerogative Court , and some in the Admiralty Court , and some in the Delegates ’
177464	177542	177549	177549	you	232	’ shops . He was got up with such care , and was so stiff , that he could hardly bend himself ; being obliged , when he glanced at some papers on his desk , after sitting down in his chair , to move his whole body , from the bottom of his spine , like Punch . I had previously been presented by my aunt , and had been courteously received . He now said : ‘
177736	177742	177744	177745	Mr. Spenlow	447	‘ Oh surely ! surely ! ’
177747	177793	177744	177745	Mr. Spenlow	447	‘ We always , in this house , propose a month -- an initiatory month . I should be happy , myself , to propose two months -- three -- an indefinite period , in fact -- but I have a partner . Mr. Jorkins . ’
177794	177801	177802	177802	I	0	‘ And the premium , sir , ’
177805	177811	177802	177802	I	0	‘ is a thousand pounds ? ’
177812	177825	177827	177828	Mr. Spenlow	447	‘ And the premium , Stamp included , is a thousand pounds , ’
177830	177889	177827	177828	Mr. Spenlow	447	‘ As I have mentioned to Miss Trotwood , I am actuated by no mercenary considerations ; few men are less so , I believe ; but Mr. Jorkins has his opinions on these subjects , and I am bound to respect Mr. Jorkins ’s opinions . Mr. Jorkins thinks a thousand pounds too little , in short . ’
177890	177896	177898	177898	I	0	‘ I suppose , sir , ’
177907	177963	177898	177898	I	0	‘ that it is not the custom here , if an articled clerk were particularly useful , and made himself a perfect master of his profession’--I could not help blushing , this looked so like praising myself--‘I suppose it is not the custom , in the later years of his time , to allow him any-- ’

177996	178026	177974	177974	his	447	‘ No . I will not say what consideration I might give to that point myself , Mr. Copperfield , if I were unfettered . Mr. Jorkins is immovable . ’
178364	178971	178362	178363	the Doctors	3841	’ names upon the doors , to be the official abiding - places of the learned advocates of whom Steerforth had told me ; and into a large dull room , not unlike a chapel to my thinking , on the left hand . The upper part of this room was fenced off from the rest ; and there , on the two sides of a raised platform of the horse - shoe form , sitting on easy old - fashioned dining - room chairs , were sundry gentlemen in red gowns and grey wigs , whom I found to be the Doctors aforesaid . Blinking over a little desk like a pulpit - desk , in the curve of the horse - shoe , was an old gentleman , whom , if I had seen him in an aviary , I should certainly have taken for an owl , but who , I learned , was the presiding judge . In the space within the horse - shoe , lower than these , that is to say , on about the level of the floor , were sundry other gentlemen , of Mr. Spenlow ’s rank , and dressed like him in black gowns with white fur upon them , sitting at a long green table . Their cravats were in general stiff , I thought , and their looks haughty ; but in this last respect I presently conceived I had done them an injustice , for when two or three of them had to rise and answer a question of the presiding dignitary , I never saw anything more sheepish . The public , represented by a boy with a comforter , and a shabby - genteel man secretly eating crumbs out of his coat pockets , was warming itself at a stove in the centre of the Court . The languid stillness of the place was only broken by the chirping of this fire and by the voice of one of the Doctors , who was wandering slowly through a perfect library of evidence , and stopping to put up , from time to time , at little roadside inns of argument on the journey . Altogether , I have never , on any occasion , made one at such a cosey , dosey , old - fashioned , time - forgotten , sleepy - headed little family - party in all my life ; and I felt it would be quite a soothing opiate to belong to it in any character -- except perhaps as a suitor . Very well satisfied with the dreamy nature of this retreat , I informed Mr. Spenlow that I had seen enough for that time , and we rejoined my aunt ; in company with whom I presently departed from the Commons , feeling very young when I went out of Spenlow and Jorkins ’s , on account of the clerks poking one another with their pens to point me out . We arrived at Lincoln ’s Inn Fields without any new adventures , except encountering an unlucky donkey in a costermonger ’s cart , who suggested painful associations to my aunt . We had another long talk about my plans , when we were safely housed ; and as I knew she was anxious to get home , and , between fire , food , and pickpockets , could never be considered at her ease for half - an - hour in London , I urged her not to be uncomfortable on my account , but to leave me to take care of myself . ‘

Terms moderate , and could be taken for a month only , if required . ‘

I am very miserable!’--only that I doubted , even at that pass , if Mrs. Crupp were quite the sort of woman to confide in ! CHAPTER 25 . GOOD AND BAD ANGELS I was going out at my door on the morning after that deplorable day of headache , sickness , and repentance , with an odd confusion in my mind relative to the date of my dinner - party , as if a body of Titans had taken an enormous lever and pushed the day before yesterday some months back , when I saw a ticket - porter coming upstairs , with a letter in his hand . He was taking his time about his errand , then ; but when he saw me on the top of the staircase , looking at him over the banisters , he swung into a trot , and came up panting as if he had run himself into a state of exhaustion . ‘
184439	184598	184437	184437	Esquire	357	’ said the ticket - porter , touching his hat with his little cane . I could scarcely lay claim to the name : I was so disturbed by the conviction that the letter came from Agnes . However , I told him I was T. Copperfield , Esquire , and he believed it , and gave me the letter , which he said required an answer . I shut him out on the landing to wait for the answer , and went into my chambers again , in such a nervous state that I was fain to lay the letter down on my breakfast table , and familiarize myself with the outside of it a little , before I could resolve to break the seal . I found , when I did open it , that it was a very kind note , containing no reference to my condition at the theatre . All it said was , ‘
184645	184703	184643	184643	AGNES	375	’ It took me such a long time to write an answer at all to my satisfaction , that I do n’t know what the ticket - porter can have thought , unless he thought I was learning to write . I must have written half - a - dozen answers at least . I began one , ‘
184739	184790	184735	184735	I	0	‘ Shakespeare has observed , my dear Agnes , how strange it is that a man should put an enemy into his mouth’--that reminded me of Markham , and it got no farther . I even tried poetry . I began one note , in a six - syllable line , ‘
184817	184855	184814	184814	I	0	‘ My dear Agnes . Your letter is like you , and what could I say of it that would be higher praise than that ? I will come at four o’clock . Affectionately and sorrowfully , T.C. ’
184904	185162	185199	185199	you	4017	’ Commons as it was to me , I sincerely believe he made some expiation for his share in that rotten old ecclesiastical cheese . Although I left the office at half past three , and was prowling about the place of appointment within a few minutes afterwards , the appointed time was exceeded by a full quarter of an hour , according to the clock of St. Andrew ’s , Holborn , before I could muster up sufficient desperation to pull the private bell - handle let into the left - hand door - post of Mr. Waterbrook ’s house . The professional business of Mr. Waterbrook ’s establishment was done on the ground - floor , and the genteel business ( of which there was a good deal ) in the upper part of the building . I was shown into a pretty but rather close drawing - room , and there sat Agnes , netting a purse . She looked so quiet and good , and reminded me so strongly of my airy fresh school days at Canterbury , and the sodden , smoky , stupid wretch I had been the other night , that , nobody being by , I yielded to my self - reproach and shame , and -- in short , made a fool of myself . I can not deny that I shed tears . To this hour I am undecided whether it was upon the whole the wisest thing I could have done , or the most ridiculous . ‘
185173	185182	185169	185169	you	4017	’ said I , turning away my head , ‘
185214	185259	185204	185204	I	0	’ She put her hand -- its touch was like no other hand -- upon my arm for a moment ; and I felt so befriended and comforted , that I could not help moving it to my lips , and gratefully kissing it . ‘
185263	185269	185204	185204	I	0	’ said Agnes , cheerfully . ‘

185307	185321	185301	185301	You	375	’ She smiled rather sadly , I thought , and shook her head . ‘
185335	185336	185331	185333	my good Angel	4018	’ ‘
185345	185349	185338	185338	I	0	’ she returned , ‘
185364	185380	185358	185358	my	0	’ I looked at her inquiringly ; but already with a foreknowledge of her meaning . ‘
185385	185394	185358	185358	my	0	’ said Agnes , with a steady glance , ‘
185400	185401	185402	185402	My	0	’ ‘
185406	185410	185402	185402	My	0	’ I began , ‘

185422	185426	185420	185420	Trotwood	228	’ she returned . ‘

185507	185512	185499	185499	I	0	’ she quietly replied . ‘

185570	185663	185565	185565	he	463	’ There was always something in her modest voice that seemed to touch a chord within me , answering to that sound alone . It was always earnest ; but when it was very earnest , as it was now , there was a thrill in it that quite subdued me . I sat looking at her as she cast her eyes down on her work ; I sat seeming still to listen to her ; and Steerforth , in spite of all my attachment to him , darkened in that tone . ‘
185671	185679	185669	185669	me	0	’ said Agnes , looking up again , ‘
185798	185831	185787	185787	I	0	’ Again I looked at her , again I listened to her after she was silent , and again his image , though it was still fixed in my heart , darkened . ‘
185841	185855	185832	185832	I	0	’ said Agnes , resuming her usual tone , after a little while , ‘
185917	185936	185908	185908	you	375	’ with a quiet smile , for I was going to interrupt her , and she knew why , ‘
185961	185962	185954	185954	you	375	’ ‘
185970	185974	185963	185963	I	0	’ I replied , ‘

185999	186039	185963	185963	I	0	’ said Agnes . I saw a passing shadow on her face when I made this mention of him , but she returned my smile , and we were again as unreserved in our mutual confidence as of old . ‘
186045	186049	186051	186051	you	0	’ said I , ‘
186058	186059	186051	186051	you	0	’ ‘
186065	186154	186061	186061	I	0	’ said Agnes . She would have dismissed the subject so , but I was too full of it to allow that , and insisted on telling her how it happened that I had disgraced myself , and what chain of accidental circumstances had had the theatre for its final link . It was a great relief to me to do this , and to enlarge on the obligation that I owed to Steerforth for his care of me when I was unable to take care of myself . ‘
186160	186175	186177	186177	you	0	’ said Agnes , calmly changing the conversation as soon as I had concluded , ‘
186208	186209	186210	186211	No one	8485	’ ‘
186215	186216	186217	186217	Someone	9908	’ ‘
186221	186233	186217	186217	Someone	9908	’ said Agnes , laughing , and holding up her finger . ‘
186278	186352	186276	186276	her	418	’ Agnes laughed again at her own penetration , and told me that if I were faithful to her in my confidence she thought she should keep a little register of my violent attachments , with the date , duration , and termination of each , like the table of the reigns of the kings and queens , in the History of England . Then she asked me if I had seen Uriah . ‘
186356	186359	186353	186354	Uriah Heep	373	’ said I. ‘
186367	186368	186369	186369	He	373	’ ‘
186379	186383	186369	186369	He	373	’ returned Agnes . ‘
186402	186403	186393	186393	I	0	’ ‘
186417	186420	186412	186412	Agnes	375	’ said I. ‘
186426	186457	186458	186458	I	0	’ Agnes laid aside her work , and replied , folding her hands upon one another , and looking pensively at me out of those beautiful soft eyes of hers : ‘
186470	186471	186468	186468	papa	2049	’ ‘
186488	186494	186483	186483	himself	373	’ I cried , indignantly . ‘
186545	186572	186573	186573	You	0	’ Still looking at me , Agnes shook her head while I was speaking , with a faint smile at my warmth : and then replied : ‘
186650	186651	186645	186645	I	0	’ ‘
186664	186665	186666	186666	Uriah	373	’ ‘
186668	186678	186681	186681	himself	373	’ she replied , after a moment ’s hesitation , ‘
186727	186821	186822	186822	His	2049	’ There was more that she might have said ; more that she knew , or that she suspected ; I clearly saw . I could not give her pain by asking what it was , for I knew that she withheld it from me , to spare her father . It had long been going on to this , I was sensible : yes , I could not but feel , on the least reflection , that it had been going on to this for a long time . I remained silent . ‘
186827	186831	186822	186822	His	2049	’ said Agnes , ‘
186872	186893	186863	186863	he	2049	’ I said he was a hound , which , at the moment , was a great satisfaction to me . ‘
186910	186914	186915	186915	he	2049	’ pursued Agnes , ‘
186991	186992	186981	186981	he	381	’ ‘
187002	187003	187004	187004	I	0	’ ‘
187009	187013	187004	187004	I	0	’ she replied , ‘
187075	187093	187073	187073	Trotwood	228	’ cried Agnes , putting her hands before her face , as her tears started on it , ‘
187221	187307	187310	187310	Agnes	375	’ I had never before seen Agnes cry . I had seen tears in her eyes when I had brought new honours home from school , and I had seen them there when we last spoke about her father , and I had seen her turn her gentle head aside when we took leave of one another ; but I had never seen her grieve like this . It made me so sorry that I could only say , in a foolish , helpless manner , ‘
187322	187392	187393	187393	We	4054	’ But Agnes was too superior to me in character and purpose , as I know well now , whatever I might know or not know then , to be long in need of my entreaties . The beautiful , calm manner , which makes her so different in my remembrance from everybody else , came back again , as if a cloud had passed from a serene sky . ‘
187403	187407	187393	187393	We	4054	’ said Agnes , ‘
187484	188304	187480	187480	papa	2049	’ Agnes had no time to say more , for the room door opened , and Mrs. Waterbrook , who was a large lady -- or who wore a large dress : I do n’t exactly know which , for I do n’t know which was dress and which was lady -- came sailing in . I had a dim recollection of having seen her at the theatre , as if I had seen her in a pale magic lantern ; but she appeared to remember me perfectly , and still to suspect me of being in a state of intoxication . Finding by degrees , however , that I was sober , and ( I hope ) that I was a modest young gentleman , Mrs. Waterbrook softened towards me considerably , and inquired , firstly , if I went much into the parks , and secondly , if I went much into society . On my replying to both these questions in the negative , it occurred to me that I fell again in her good opinion ; but she concealed the fact gracefully , and invited me to dinner next day . I accepted the invitation , and took my leave , making a call on Uriah in the office as I went out , and leaving a card for him in his absence . When I went to dinner next day , and on the street door being opened , plunged into a vapour - bath of haunch of mutton , I divined that I was not the only guest , for I immediately identified the ticket - porter in disguise , assisting the family servant , and waiting at the foot of the stairs to carry up my name . He looked , to the best of his ability , when he asked me for it confidentially , as if he had never seen me before ; but well did I know him , and well did he know me . Conscience made cowards of us both . I found Mr. Waterbrook to be a middle - aged gentleman , with a short throat , and a good deal of shirt - collar , who only wanted a black nose to be the portrait of a pug - dog . He told me he was happy to have the honour of making my acquaintance ; and when I had paid my homage to Mrs. Waterbrook , presented me , with much ceremony , to a very awful lady in a black velvet dress , and a great black velvet hat , whom I remember as looking like a near relation of Hamlet’s -- say his aunt . Mrs. Henry Spiker was this lady ’s name ; and her husband was there too : so cold a man , that his head , instead of being grey , seemed to be sprinkled with hoar - frost . Immense deference was shown to the Henry Spikers , male and female ; which Agnes told me was on account of Mr. Henry Spiker being solicitor to something or to somebody , I forget what or which , remotely connected with the Treasury . I found Uriah Heep among the company , in a suit of black , and in deep humility . He told me , when I shook hands with him , that he was proud to be noticed by me , and that he really felt obliged to me for my condescension . I could have wished he had been less obliged to me , for he hovered about me in his gratitude all the rest of the evening ; and whenever I said a word to Agnes , was sure , with his shadowless eyes and cadaverous face , to be looking gauntly down upon us from behind . There were other guests -- all iced for the occasion , as it struck me , like the wine . But there was one who attracted my attention before he came in , on account of my hearing him announced as Mr. Traddles ! My mind flew back to Salem House ; and could it be Tommy , I thought , who used to draw the skeletons ! I looked for Mr. Traddles with unusual interest . He was a sober , steady - looking young man of retiring manners , with a comic head of hair , and eyes that were rather wide open ; and he got into an obscure corner so soon , that I had some difficulty in making him out . At length I had a good view of him , and either my vision deceived me , or it was the old unfortunate Tommy . I made my way to Mr. Waterbrook , and said , that I believed I had the pleasure of seeing an old schoolfellow there . ‘
188307	188314	187480	187480	papa	2049	’ said Mr. Waterbrook , surprised . ‘
188329	188330	188325	188327	Mr. Henry Spiker	471	’ ‘
188339	188343	188344	188344	I	0	’ I returned . ‘
188351	188352	188349	188349	Traddles	306	’ ‘
188361	188371	188380	188382	the same person	4060	’ said my host , with much diminished interest . ‘
188374	188375	188380	188382	the same person	4060	’ ‘
188384	188392	188380	188382	the same person	4060	’ said I , glancing towards him , ‘
188413	188414	188407	188407	he	306	’ ‘
188424	188437	188438	188438	Traddles	306	’ returned my host nodding his head with an air of toleration . ‘
188445	188446	188441	188443	a good fellow	11366	’ ‘
188453	188456	188441	188443	a good fellow	11366	’ said I. ‘
188461	188466	188438	188438	Traddles	306	’ returned my host , ‘
188527	188559	188524	188525	Mr. Copperfield	232	’ I murmured an assent , which was full of feeling , considering that I knew nothing at all about him ; and I inquired what Mr. Traddles was by profession . ‘
188562	188567	188569	188571	a young man	11003	’ returned Mr. Waterbrook , ‘
188593	188594	188596	188596	he	306	’ ‘
188601	188610	188596	188596	he	306	’ said I , sorry to hear this . ‘
188613	188640	188596	188596	he	306	’ returned Mr. Waterbrook , pursing up his mouth , and playing with his watch - chain , in a comfortable , prosperous sort of way . ‘
188739	188761	188690	188690	He	306	’ I was much impressed by the extremely comfortable and satisfied manner in which Mr. Waterbrook delivered himself of this little word ‘
188763	189228	189229	189229	I	0	’ , every now and then . There was wonderful expression in it . It completely conveyed the idea of a man who had been born , not to say with a silver spoon , but with a scaling - ladder , and had gone on mounting all the heights of life one after another , until now he looked , from the top of the fortifications , with the eye of a philosopher and a patron , on the people down in the trenches . My reflections on this theme were still in progress when dinner was announced . Mr. Waterbrook went down with Hamlet ’s aunt . Mr. Henry Spiker took Mrs. Waterbrook . Agnes , whom I should have liked to take myself , was given to a simpering fellow with weak legs . Uriah , Traddles , and I , as the junior part of the company , went down last , how we could . I was not so vexed at losing Agnes as I might have been , since it gave me an opportunity of making myself known to Traddles on the stairs , who greeted me with great fervour ; while Uriah writhed with such obtrusive satisfaction and self - abasement , that I could gladly have pitched him over the banisters . Traddles and I were separated at table , being billeted in two remote corners : he in the glare of a red velvet lady ; I , in the gloom of Hamlet ’s aunt . The dinner was very long , and the conversation was about the Aristocracy -- and Blood . Mrs. Waterbrook repeatedly told us , that if she had a weakness , it was Blood . It occurred to me several times that we should have got on better , if we had not been quite so genteel . We were so exceedingly genteel , that our scope was very limited . A Mr. and Mrs. Gulpidge were of the party , who had something to do at second - hand ( at least , Mr. Gulpidge had ) with the law business of the Bank ; and what with the Bank , and what with the Treasury , we were as exclusive as the Court Circular . To mend the matter , Hamlet ’s aunt had the family failing of indulging in soliloquy , and held forth in a desultory manner , by herself , on every topic that was introduced . These were few enough , to be sure ; but as we always fell back upon Blood , she had as wide a field for abstract speculation as her nephew himself . We might have been a party of Ogres , the conversation assumed such a sanguine complexion . ‘
189239	189253	189231	189231	I	0	’ said Mr. Waterbrook , with his wine - glass at his eye . ‘
189269	189270	189229	189229	I	0	’ ‘
189277	189283	189229	189229	I	0	’ observed Hamlet ’s aunt , ‘
189423	189448	189417	189417	It	4081	’ The simpering fellow with the weak legs , who had taken Agnes down , stated the question more decisively yet , I thought . ‘
189458	189472	189473	189473	we	4080	’ said this gentleman , looking round the board with an imbecile smile , ‘
189556	189593	189541	189541	deuce	374	‘ em ! Myself , I ’d rather at any time be knocked down by a man who had got Blood in him , than I ’d be picked up by a man who had n’t ! ’
189669	189693	189695	189696	Mr. Gulpidge	475	‘ That affair of the first bond for four thousand five hundred pounds has not taken the course that was expected , Spiker , ’

189811	189818	189792	189792	Lord	4089	’ repeated Mr. Gulpidge , firmly . ‘

189832	189842	189830	189830	K.	478	’ said Mr. Spiker , with an ominous look . ‘
189869	189882	189860	189860	he	475	’ Mr. Spiker was so interested , that he became quite stony . ‘
189891	189903	189904	189904	Our	4090	’ said Mr. Gulpidge , throwing himself back in his chair . ‘
189928	190557	189906	189906	Waterbrook	460	’ Mr. Waterbrook was only too happy , as it appeared to me , to have such interests , and such names , even hinted at , across his table . He assumed an expression of gloomy intelligence ( though I am persuaded he knew no more about the discussion than I did ) , and highly approved of the discretion that had been observed . Mr. Spiker , after the receipt of such a confidence , naturally desired to favour his friend with a confidence of his own ; therefore the foregoing dialogue was succeeded by another , in which it was Mr. Gulpidge ’s turn to be surprised , and that by another in which the surprise came round to Mr. Spiker ’s turn again , and so on , turn and turn about . All this time we , the outsiders , remained oppressed by the tremendous interests involved in the conversation ; and our host regarded us with pride , as the victims of a salutary awe and astonishment . I was very glad indeed to get upstairs to Agnes , and to talk with her in a corner , and to introduce Traddles to her , who was shy , but agreeable , and the same good - natured creature still . As he was obliged to leave early , on account of going away next morning for a month , I had not nearly so much conversation with him as I could have wished ; but we exchanged addresses , and promised ourselves the pleasure of another meeting when he should come back to town . He was greatly interested to hear that I knew Steerforth , and spoke of him with such warmth that I made him tell Agnes what he thought of him . But Agnes only looked at me the while , and very slightly shook her head when only I observed her . As she was not among people with whom I believed she could be very much at home , I was almost glad to hear that she was going away within a few days , though I was sorry at the prospect of parting from her again so soon . This caused me to remain until all the company were gone . Conversing with her , and hearing her sing , was such a delightful reminder to me of my happy life in the grave old house she had made so beautiful , that I could have remained there half the night ; but , having no excuse for staying any longer , when the lights of Mr. Waterbrook ’s society were all snuffed out , I took my leave very much against my inclination . I felt then , more than ever , that she was my better Angel ; and if I thought of her sweet face and placid smile , as though they had shone on me from some removed being , like an Angel , I hope I thought no harm . I have said that the company were all gone ; but I ought to have excepted Uriah , whom I do n’t include in that denomination , and who had never ceased to hover near us . He was close behind me when I went downstairs . He was close beside me , when I walked away from the house , slowly fitting his long skeleton fingers into the still longer fingers of a great Guy Fawkes pair of gloves . It was in no disposition for Uriah ’s company , but in remembrance of the entreaty Agnes had made to me , that I asked him if he would come home to my rooms , and have some coffee . ‘
190565	190605	190562	190563	Master Copperfield	232	’ he rejoined--‘I beg your pardon , Mister Copperfield , but the other comes so natural , I do n’t like that you should put a constraint upon yourself to ask a numble person like me to your ouse . ’
190606	190615	190617	190617	I.	4092	‘ There is no constraint in the case , ’
190618	190623	190617	190617	I.	4092	‘ Will you come ? ’
190624	190633	190635	190635	Uriah	373	‘ I should like to , very much , ’
190641	190649	190651	190651	I.	4092	‘ Well , then , come along ! ’
190871	190882	190884	190884	Uriah	373	‘ Oh , really , Master Copperfield,--I mean Mister Copperfield , ’
190886	190965	190884	190884	Uriah	373	‘ to see you waiting upon me is what I never could have expected ! But , one way and another , so many things happen to me which I never could have expected , I am sure , in my umble station , that it seems to rain blessings on my ed . You have heard something , I des - say , of a change in my expectations , Master Copperfield,--I should say , Mister Copperfield ? ’
191099	191125	191127	191127	Uriah	373	‘ You have heard something , I des - say , of a change in my expectations , Master Copperfield,--I should say , Mister Copperfield ? ’

191499	191503	191496	191497	Mister Copperfield	232	’ replied Uriah . ‘

191565	191571	191548	191548	You	232	’ said I , drily . ‘
191581	191585	191577	191577	you	232	’ exclaimed Uriah . ‘
191624	191813	191614	191614	you	232	’ Something in the emphasis he laid upon the kindling of those sparks , and something in the glance he directed at me as he said it , had made me start as if I had seen him illuminated by a blaze of light . Recalled by his request , preferred in quite another tone of voice , I did the honours of the shaving - pot ; but I did them with an unsteadiness of hand , a sudden sense of being no match for him , and a perplexed suspicious anxiety as to what he might be going to say next , which I felt could not escape his observation . He said nothing at all . He stirred his coffee round and round , he sipped it , he felt his chin softly with his grisly hand , he looked at the fire , he looked about the room , he gasped rather than smiled at me , he writhed and undulated about , in his deferential servility , he stirred and sipped again , but he left the renewal of the conversation to me . ‘
191819	191826	191816	191817	Mr. Wickfield	372	’ said I , at last , ‘

191884	191891	191881	191882	Master Copperfield	232	’ returned Uriah , sighing modestly . ‘

191923	191934	191921	191921	Uriah	373	’ said I , bolting it out with some difficulty . ‘

192094	192160	192091	192091	his	372	’ said Uriah , very slowly , as he stretched out his cruel - looking hand above my table , and pressed his own thumb upon it , until it shook , and shook the room . If I had been obliged to look at him with him splay foot on Mr. Wickfield ’s head , I think I could scarcely have hated him more . ‘
192170	192201	192167	192168	Master Copperfield	232	’ he proceeded , in a soft voice , most remarkably contrasting with the action of his thumb , which did not diminish its hard pressure in the least degree , ‘
192261	192343	192344	192345	Master Copperfield	232	’ With his face turned towards me , as he finished , but without looking at me , he took his crooked thumb off the spot where he had planted it , and slowly and thoughtfully scraped his lank jaw with it , as if he were shaving himself . I recollect well how indignantly my heart beat , as I saw his crafty face , with the appropriately red light of the fire upon it , preparing for something else . ‘
192347	192356	192344	192345	Master Copperfield	232	’ he began--‘but am I keeping you up ? ’
192357	192372	192344	192345	Master Copperfield	232	‘ You are not keeping me up . I generally go to bed late . ’
192373	192440	192344	192345	Master Copperfield	232	‘ Thank you , Master Copperfield ! I have risen from my umble station since first you used to address me , it is true ; but I am umble still . I hope I never shall be otherwise than umble . You will not think the worse of my umbleness , if I make a little confidence to you , Master Copperfield ? Will you ? ’

192515	192527	192506	192506	himself	4114	‘ You thought her looking very beautiful tonight , Master Copperfield ? ’

192613	192637	192638	192638	he	4114	‘ is , in fact , the confidence that I am going to take the liberty of reposing . Umble as I am , ’
192655	192745	192638	192638	he	4114	‘ umble as my mother is , and lowly as our poor but honest roof has ever been , the image of Miss Agnes ( I do n’t mind trusting you with my secret , Master Copperfield , for I have always overflowed towards you since the first moment I had the pleasure of beholding you in a pony - shay ) has been in my breast for years . Oh , Master Copperfield , with what a pure affection do I love the ground my Agnes walks on ! ’

192985	193099	192982	192982	he	4115	‘ oh dear , no ! Not to anyone but you . You see I am only just emerging from my lowly station . I rest a good deal of hope on her observing how useful I am to her father ( for I trust to be very useful to him indeed , Master Copperfield ) , and how I smooth the way for him , and keep him straight . She ’s so much attached to her father , Master Copperfield ( oh , what a lovely thing it is in a daughter ! ) , that I think she may come , on his account , to be kind to me . ’

I know what a friendly heart you ’ve got ; but having only known me on my umble footing ( on my umblest I should say , for I am very umble still ) , you might , unbeknown , go against me rather , with my Agnes . I call her mine , you see , Master Copperfield . There ’s a song that says , “ I ’d crowns resign , to call her mine ! ” I hope to do it , one of these days . ’

193668	194573	194574	194574	I	0	’ His repudiation of this offer was almost shrill enough , in the excess of its surprise and humility , to have penetrated to the ears of Mrs. Crupp , then sleeping , I suppose , in a distant chamber , situated at about the level of low - water mark , soothed in her slumbers by the ticking of an incorrigible clock , to which she always referred me when we had any little difference on the score of punctuality , and which was never less than three - quarters of an hour too slow , and had always been put right in the morning by the best authorities . As no arguments I could urge , in my bewildered condition , had the least effect upon his modesty in inducing him to accept my bedroom , I was obliged to make the best arrangements I could , for his repose before the fire . The mattress of the sofa ( which was a great deal too short for his lank figure ) , the sofa pillows , a blanket , the table - cover , a clean breakfast - cloth , and a great - coat , made him a bed and covering , for which he was more than thankful . Having lent him a night - cap , which he put on at once , and in which he made such an awful figure , that I have never worn one since , I left him to his rest . I never shall forget that night . I never shall forget how I turned and tumbled ; how I wearied myself with thinking about Agnes and this creature ; how I considered what could I do , and what ought I to do ; how I could come to no other conclusion than that the best course for her peace was to do nothing , and to keep to myself what I had heard . If I went to sleep for a few moments , the image of Agnes with her tender eyes , and of her father looking fondly on her , as I had so often seen him look , arose before me with appealing faces , and filled me with vague terrors . When I awoke , the recollection that Uriah was lying in the next room , sat heavy on me like a waking nightmare ; and oppressed me with a leaden dread , as if I had had some meaner quality of devil for a lodger . The poker got into my dozing thoughts besides , and would n’t come out . I thought , between sleeping and waking , that it was still red hot , and I had snatched it out of the fire , and run him through the body . I was so haunted at last by the idea , though I knew there was nothing in it , that I stole into the next room to look at him . There I saw him , lying on his back , with his legs extending to I do n’t know where , gurglings taking place in his throat , stoppages in his nose , and his mouth open like a post - office . He was so much worse in reality than in my distempered fancy , that afterwards I was attracted to him in very repulsion , and could not help wandering in and out every half - hour or so , and taking another look at him . Still , the long , long night seemed heavy and hopeless as ever , and no promise of day was in the murky sky . When I saw him going downstairs early in the morning ( for , thank Heaven ! he would not stay to breakfast ) , it appeared to me as if the night was going away in his person . When I went out to the Commons , I charged Mrs. Crupp with particular directions to leave the windows open , that my sitting - room might be aired , and purged of his presence . CHAPTER 26 . I FALL INTO CAPTIVITY I saw no more of Uriah Heep , until the day when Agnes left town . I was at the coach office to take leave of her and see her go ; and there was he , returning to Canterbury by the same conveyance . It was some small satisfaction to me to observe his spare , short - waisted , high - shouldered , mulberry - coloured great - coat perched up , in company with an umbrella like a small tent , on the edge of the back seat on the roof , while Agnes was , of course , inside ; but what I underwent in my efforts to be friendly with him , while Agnes looked on , perhaps deserved that little recompense . At the coach window , as at the dinner - party , he hovered about us without a moment ’s intermission , like a great vulture : gorging himself on every syllable that I said to Agnes , or Agnes said to me . In the state of trouble into which his disclosure by my fire had thrown me , I had thought very much of the words Agnes had used in reference to the partnership . ‘
194606	195219	194599	194599	I	0	’ A miserable foreboding that she would yield to , and sustain herself by , the same feeling in reference to any sacrifice for his sake , had oppressed me ever since . I knew how she loved him . I knew what the devotion of her nature was . I knew from her own lips that she regarded herself as the innocent cause of his errors , and as owing him a great debt she ardently desired to pay . I had no consolation in seeing how different she was from this detestable Rufus with the mulberry - coloured great - coat , for I felt that in the very difference between them , in the self - denial of her pure soul and the sordid baseness of his , the greatest danger lay . All this , doubtless , he knew thoroughly , and had , in his cunning , considered well . Yet I was so certain that the prospect of such a sacrifice afar off , must destroy the happiness of Agnes ; and I was so sure , from her manner , of its being unseen by her then , and having cast no shadow on her yet ; that I could as soon have injured her , as given her any warning of what impended . Thus it was that we parted without explanation : she waving her hand and smiling farewell from the coach window ; her evil genius writhing on the roof , as if he had her in his clutches and triumphed . I could not get over this farewell glimpse of them for a long time . When Agnes wrote to tell me of her safe arrival , I was as miserable as when I saw her going away . Whenever I fell into a thoughtful state , this subject was sure to present itself , and all my uneasiness was sure to be redoubled . Hardly a night passed without my dreaming of it . It became a part of my life , and as inseparable from my life as my own head . I had ample leisure to refine upon my uneasiness : for Steerforth was at Oxford , as he wrote to me , and when I was not at the Commons , I was very much alone . I believe I had at this time some lurking distrust of Steerforth . I wrote to him most affectionately in reply to his , but I think I was glad , upon the whole , that he could not come to London just then . I suspect the truth to be , that the influence of Agnes was upon me , undisturbed by the sight of him ; and that it was the more powerful with me , because she had so large a share in my thoughts and interest . In the meantime , days and weeks slipped away . I was articled to Spenlow and Jorkins . I had ninety pounds a year ( exclusive of my house - rent and sundry collateral matters ) from my aunt . My rooms were engaged for twelve months certain : and though I still found them dreary of an evening , and the evenings long , I could settle down into a state of equable low spirits , and resign myself to coffee ; which I seem , on looking back , to have taken by the gallon at about this period of my existence . At about this time , too , I made three discoveries : first , that Mrs. Crupp was a martyr to a curious disorder called ‘
195222	195330	194599	194599	I	0	’ , which was generally accompanied with inflammation of the nose , and required to be constantly treated with peppermint ; secondly , that something peculiar in the temperature of my pantry , made the brandy - bottles burst ; thirdly , that I was alone in the world , and much given to record that circumstance in fragments of English versification . On the day when I was articled , no festivity took place , beyond my having sandwiches and sherry into the office for the clerks , and going alone to the theatre at night . I went to see The Stranger , as a Doctors ’
195820	196537	196538	196538	I	0	’ Commons . There was a good deal of competition in the Commons on all points of display , and it turned out some very choice equipages then ; though I always have considered , and always shall consider , that in my time the great article of competition there was starch : which I think was worn among the proctors to as great an extent as it is in the nature of man to bear . We were very pleasant , going down , and Mr. Spenlow gave me some hints in reference to my profession . He said it was the genteelest profession in the world , and must on no account be confounded with the profession of a solicitor : being quite another sort of thing , infinitely more exclusive , less mechanical , and more profitable . We took things much more easily in the Commons than they could be taken anywhere else , he observed , and that set us , as a privileged class , apart . He said it was impossible to conceal the disagreeable fact , that we were chiefly employed by solicitors ; but he gave me to understand that they were an inferior race of men , universally looked down upon by all proctors of any pretensions . I asked Mr. Spenlow what he considered the best sort of professional business ? He replied , that a good case of a disputed will , where there was a neat little estate of thirty or forty thousand pounds , was , perhaps , the best of all . In such a case , he said , not only were there very pretty pickings , in the way of arguments at every stage of the proceedings , and mountains upon mountains of evidence on interrogatory and counter - interrogatory ( to say nothing of an appeal lying , first to the Delegates , and then to the Lords ) , but , the costs being pretty sure to come out of the estate at last , both sides went at it in a lively and spirited manner , and expense was no consideration . Then , he launched into a general eulogium on the Commons . What was to be particularly admired ( he said ) in the Commons , was its compactness . It was the most conveniently organized place in the world . It was the complete idea of snugness . It lay in a nutshell . For example : You brought a divorce case , or a restitution case , into the Consistory . Very good . You tried it in the Consistory . You made a quiet little round game of it , among a family group , and you played it out at leisure . Suppose you were not satisfied with the Consistory , what did you do then ? Why , you went into the Arches . What was the Arches ? The same court , in the same room , with the same bar , and the same practitioners , but another judge , for there the Consistory judge could plead any court - day as an advocate . Well , you played your round game out again . Still you were not satisfied . Very good . What did you do then ? Why , you went to the Delegates . Who were the Delegates ? Why , the Ecclesiastical Delegates were the advocates without any business , who had looked on at the round game when it was playing in both courts , and had seen the cards shuffled , and cut , and played , and had talked to all the players about it , and now came fresh , as judges , to settle the matter to the satisfaction of everybody ! Discontented people might talk of corruption in the Commons , closeness in the Commons , and the necessity of reforming the Commons , said Mr. Spenlow solemnly , in conclusion ; but when the price of wheat per bushel had been highest , the Commons had been busiest ; and a man might lay his hand upon his heart , and say this to the whole world,--‘Touch the Commons , and down comes the country ! ’

As the chances of life have brought us together again , and may bring us together on other occasions , I would say , let us meet here as distant acquaintances . Family circumstances are a sufficient reason for our only meeting on that footing , and it is quite unnecessary that either of us should make the other the subject of remark . Do you approve of this ? ’

199670	199674	199640	199640	Dora	488	’ I replied . ‘
199680	199681	199640	199640	Dora	488	’ ‘
199688	199694	199695	199695	I	0	’ said Dora , pouting . ‘
199750	199765	199766	199766	Papa	381	’ He only winked lazily , when she kissed his ball of a head . ‘
199835	199874	199833	199833	Jip	491	’ Jip made a comfortable noise , in answer , a little like a tea - kettle when it sings . As for me , every word was a new heap of fetters , riveted above the last . ‘
199958	200600	199956	199956	Jip	491	’ If it had lasted any longer , I think I must have gone down on my knees on the gravel , with the probability before me of grazing them , and of being presently ejected from the premises besides . But , by good fortune the greenhouse was not far off , and these words brought us to it . It contained quite a show of beautiful geraniums . We loitered along in front of them , and Dora often stopped to admire this one or that one , and I stopped to admire the same one , and Dora , laughing , held the dog up childishly , to smell the flowers ; and if we were not all three in Fairyland , certainly I was . The scent of a geranium leaf , at this day , strikes me with a half comical half serious wonder as to what change has come over me in a moment ; and then I see a straw hat and blue ribbons , and a quantity of curls , and a little black dog being held up , in two slender arms , against a bank of blossoms and bright leaves . Miss Murdstone had been looking for us . She found us here ; and presented her uncongenial cheek , the little wrinkles in it filled with hair powder , to Dora to be kissed . Then she took Dora ’s arm in hers , and marched us into breakfast as if it were a soldier ’s funeral . How many cups of tea I drank , because Dora made it , I do n’t know . But , I perfectly remember that I sat swilling tea until my whole nervous system , if I had had any in those days , must have gone by the board . By and by we went to church . Miss Murdstone was between Dora and me in the pew ; but I heard her sing , and the congregation vanished . A sermon was delivered -- about Dora , of course -- and I am afraid that is all I know of the service . We had a quiet day . No company , a walk , a family dinner of four , and an evening of looking over books and pictures ; Miss Murdstone with a homily before her , and her eye upon us , keeping guard vigilantly . Ah ! little did Mr. Spenlow imagine , when he sat opposite to me after dinner that day , with his pocket - handkerchief over his head , how fervently I was embracing him , in my fancy , as his son - in - law ! Little did he think , when I took leave of him at night , that he had just given his full consent to my being engaged to Dora , and that I was invoking blessings on his head ! We departed early in the morning , for we had a Salvage case coming on in the Admiralty Court , requiring a rather accurate knowledge of the whole science of navigation , in which ( as we could n’t be expected to know much about those matters in the Commons ) the judge had entreated two old Trinity Masters , for charity ’s sake , to come and help him out . Dora was at the breakfast - table to make the tea again , however ; and I had the melancholy pleasure of taking off my hat to her in the phaeton , as she stood on the door - step with Jip in her arms . What the Admiralty was to me that day ; what nonsense I made of our case in my mind , as I listened to it ; how I saw ‘
200602	201203	199956	199956	Jip	491	’ engraved upon the blade of the silver oar which they lay upon the table , as the emblem of that high jurisdiction ; and how I felt when Mr. Spenlow went home without me ( I had had an insane hope that he might take me back again ) , as if I were a mariner myself , and the ship to which I belonged had sailed away and left me on a desert island ; I shall make no fruitless effort to describe . If that sleepy old court could rouse itself , and present in any visible form the daydreams I have had in it about Dora , it would reveal my truth . I do n’t mean the dreams that I dreamed on that day alone , but day after day , from week to week , and term to term . I went there , not to attend to what was going on , but to think about Dora . If ever I bestowed a thought upon the cases , as they dragged their slow length before me , it was only to wonder , in the matrimonial cases ( remembering Dora ) , how it was that married people could ever be otherwise than happy ; and , in the Prerogative cases , to consider , if the money in question had been left to me , what were the foremost steps I should immediately have taken in regard to Dora . Within the first week of my passion , I bought four sumptuous waistcoats -- not for myself ; I had no pride in them ; for Dora -- and took to wearing straw - coloured kid gloves in the streets , and laid the foundations of all the corns I have ever had . If the boots I wore at that period could only be produced and compared with the natural size of my feet , they would show what the state of my heart was , in a most affecting manner . And yet , wretched cripple as I made myself by this act of homage to Dora , I walked miles upon miles daily in the hope of seeing her . Not only was I soon as well known on the Norwood Road as the postmen on that beat , but I pervaded London likewise . I walked about the streets where the best shops for ladies were , I haunted the Bazaar like an unquiet spirit , I fagged through the Park again and again , long after I was quite knocked up . Sometimes , at long intervals and on rare occasions , I saw her . Perhaps I saw her glove waved in a carriage window ; perhaps I met her , walked with her and Miss Murdstone a little way , and spoke to her . In the latter case I was always very miserable afterwards , to think that I had said nothing to the purpose ; or that she had no idea of the extent of my devotion , or that she cared nothing about me . I was always looking out , as may be supposed , for another invitation to Mr. Spenlow ’s house . I was always being disappointed , for I got none . Mrs. Crupp must have been a woman of penetration ; for when this attachment was but a few weeks old , and I had not had the courage to write more explicitly even to Agnes , than that I had been to Mr. Spenlow ’s house , ‘
201207	201211	199956	199956	Jip	491	’ I added , ‘
201398	201404	201406	201407	Mrs. Crupp	450	‘ Cheer up , sir , ’

201562	201602	201560	201560	sir	979	’ Mrs. Crupp always called me Mr. Copperfull : firstly , no doubt , because it was not my name ; and secondly , I am inclined to think , in some indistinct association with a washing - day . ‘
201619	201622	201616	201617	Mrs. Crupp	450	’ said I. ‘
201626	201638	201623	201624	Mr. Copperfull	493	’ said Mrs. Crupp , with a great deal of feeling , ‘

201679	201696	201698	201699	Mrs. Crupp	450	‘ When the present set were took for you by your dear aunt , Mr. Copperfull , ’

201747	201760	201762	201762	I.	4244	‘ Is that what you found your supposition on , Mrs. Crupp ? ’
201763	201766	201768	201769	Mrs. Crupp	450	‘ Sir , ’
201778	201872	201768	201769	Mrs. Crupp	450	‘ I ’ve laundressed other young gentlemen besides yourself . A young gentleman may be over - careful of himself , or he may be under - careful of himself . He may brush his hair too regular , or too un - regular . He may wear his boots much too large for him , or much too small . That is according as the young gentleman has his original character formed . But let him go to which extreme he may , sir , there ’s a young lady in both of ‘
201875	201899	201768	201769	Mrs. Crupp	450	’ Mrs. Crupp shook her head in such a determined manner , that I had not an inch of vantage - ground left . ‘

204387	204391	204392	204392	I	0	’ said Traddles . ‘
204546	204554	204537	204537	he	496	’ ( glancing at his table ) , ‘

204618	204660	204608	204613	a young man with less originality	4339	’ As Traddles seemed to expect that I should assent to this as a matter of course , I nodded ; and he went on , with the same sprightly patience -- I can find no better expression -- as before . ‘
204684	204688	204673	204673	I	0	’ said Traddles ; ‘
204705	204720	204673	204673	I	0	’ said Traddles , wincing again as if he had had another tooth out , ‘

204903	204946	204947	204947	She	4340	’ The delight with which he entered into these particulars , did not fully present itself to me until afterwards ; for my selfish thoughts were making a ground - plan of Mr. Spenlow ’s house and garden at the same moment . ‘
204954	204958	204947	204947	She	4340	’ said Traddles ; ‘
205062	205087	205042	205042	she	4340	’ Traddles rose from his chair , and , with a triumphant smile , put his hand upon the white cloth I had observed . ‘
205090	205094	205042	205042	she	4340	’ he said , ‘
205130	205141	205162	205162	You	232	’ drawing the cloth off with great pride and care , ‘
205170	205188	205162	205162	You	232	’ said Traddles , falling a little back from it to survey it with the greater admiration , ‘

205282	205303	205260	205260	you	232	’ I praised them both , highly , and Traddles replaced the covering as carefully as he had removed it . ‘
205314	205318	205260	205260	you	232	’ said Traddles , ‘

205495	205500	205503	205503	you	306	’ I quickly exclaimed . ‘
205507	205523	205524	205524	Mr.	4360	’ Traddles looked at me , as if he wondered what I was talking about . ‘
205529	205533	205526	205527	Mrs. Micawber	342	’ I repeated . ‘
205543	205654	205655	205655	I	0	’ An opportune double knock at the door , which I knew well from old experience in Windsor Terrace , and which nobody but Mr. Micawber could ever have knocked at that door , resolved any doubt in my mind as to their being my old friends . I begged Traddles to ask his landlord to walk up . Traddles accordingly did so , over the banister ; and Mr. Micawber , not a bit changed -- his tights , his stick , his shirt - collar , and his eye - glass , all the same as ever -- came into the room with a genteel and youthful air . ‘
205663	205686	205660	205661	Mr. Traddles	306	’ said Mr. Micawber , with the old roll in his voice , as he checked himself in humming a soft tune . ‘

205819	205864	205803	205803	I	0	’ All this time , Mr. Micawber had not known me in the least , though he had stood face to face with me . But now , seeing me smile , he examined my features with more attention , fell back , cried , ‘
205878	205890	205891	205892	Good Heaven	230	’ and shook me by both hands with the utmost fervour . ‘
205897	205902	205894	205895	Mr. Traddles	306	’ said Mr. Micawber , ‘
205927	205953	205924	205925	My dear	854	’ calling over the banisters to Mrs. Micawber , while Traddles looked ( with reason ) not a little amazed at this description of me . ‘
205979	205992	205965	205965	he	4373	’ Mr. Micawber immediately reappeared , and shook hands with me again . ‘

206102	206169	206170	206170	You	4383	’ I replied that it was . Mr. Micawber continued talking as volubly as he could ; but not , I thought , without showing , by some marks of concern in his countenance , that he was sensible of sounds in the next room , as of Mrs. Micawber washing her hands , and hurriedly opening and shutting drawers that were uneasy in their action . ‘
206176	206187	206170	206170	You	4383	’ said Mr. Micawber , with one eye on Traddles , ‘
206333	206386	206387	206387	My	0	’ I was expressing my satisfaction , when Mrs. Micawber came in ; a little more slatternly than she used to be , or so she seemed now , to my unaccustomed eyes , but still with some preparation of herself for company , and with a pair of brown gloves on . ‘
206390	206400	206387	206387	My	0	’ said Mr. Micawber , leading her towards me , ‘
206420	206537	206415	206415	his	4386	’ It would have been better , as it turned out , to have led gently up to this announcement , for Mrs. Micawber , being in a delicate state of health , was overcome by it , and was taken so unwell , that Mr. Micawber was obliged , in great trepidation , to run down to the water - butt in the backyard , and draw a basinful to lave her brow with . She presently revived , however , and was really pleased to see me . We had half - an - hour ’s talk , all together ; and I asked her about the twins , who , she said , were ‘
206541	206554	206555	206557	absolute giants ’	12205	’ ; and after Master and Miss Micawber , whom she described as ‘
206557	206761	206762	206763	My dear	854	’ , but they were not produced on that occasion . Mr. Micawber was very anxious that I should stay to dinner . I should not have been averse to do so , but that I imagined I detected trouble , and calculation relative to the extent of the cold meat , in Mrs. Micawber ’s eye . I therefore pleaded another engagement ; and observing that Mrs. Micawber ’s spirits were immediately lightened , I resisted all persuasion to forego it . But I told Traddles , and Mr. and Mrs. Micawber , that before I could think of leaving , they must appoint a day when they would come and dine with me . The occupations to which Traddles stood pledged , rendered it necessary to fix a somewhat distant one ; but an appointment was made for the purpose , that suited us all , and then I took my leave . Mr. Micawber , under pretence of showing me a nearer way than that by which I had come , accompanied me to the corner of the street ; being anxious ( he explained to me ) to say a few words to an old friend , in confidence . ‘
206766	206771	206764	206764	Copperfield	232	’ said Mr. Micawber , ‘

I am too well aware that when , in the inscrutable decrees of Fate , you were reserved for me , it is possible you may have been reserved for one , destined , after a protracted struggle , at length to fall a victim to pecuniary involvements of a complicated nature . I understand your allusion , my love . I regret it , but I can bear it . ’

If you will allow me to take the liberty of remarking that there are few comestibles better , in their way , than a Devil , and that I believe , with a little division of labour , we could accomplish a good one if the young person in attendance could produce a gridiron , I would put it to you , that this little misfortune may be easily repaired . ’

211395	211399	211374	211374	I	0	’ and Traddles answered ‘
211404	211424	211374	211374	I	0	’ and I found myself afterwards sagely adding , alone , that a person must either live or die . ‘
211428	211433	211446	211447	Mr. Copperfield	232	’ returned Mrs. Micawber , ‘

211615	211621	211613	211614	a wife--	4469	’ Traddles and I both murmured ‘
211624	211625	211613	211614	a wife--	4469	’ ‘
211677	211684	211870	211871	Mr. Micawber	341	’ said Mrs. Micawber , forcibly , ‘
211725	211739	211870	211871	Mr. Micawber	341	’ I ventured to ask Mrs. Micawber how this was to be done . ‘
211743	211855	211870	211871	Mr. Micawber	341	’ said Mrs. Micawber--‘in all the papers . It appears to me , that what Mr. Micawber has to do , in justice to himself , in justice to his family , and I will even go so far as to say in justice to society , by which he has been hitherto overlooked , is to advertise in all the papers ; to describe himself plainly as so - and - so , with such and such qualifications and to put it thus : “ Now employ me , on remunerative terms , and address , post - paid , to W. M. , Post Office , Camden Town . ” ’
211856	211868	211870	211871	Mr. Micawber	341	‘ This idea of Mrs. Micawber ’s , my dear Copperfield , ’
211891	211914	211870	211871	Mr. Micawber	341	‘ is , in fact , the Leap to which I alluded , when I last had the pleasure of seeing you . ’
211915	211921	211922	211922	I	0	‘ Advertising is rather expensive , ’
211927	211931	211933	211934	Mrs. Micawber	342	‘ Exactly so ! ’
211942	212010	211933	211934	Mrs. Micawber	342	‘ Quite true , my dear Mr. Copperfield ! I have made the identical observation to Mr. Micawber . It is for that reason especially , that I think Mr. Micawber ought ( as I have already said , in justice to himself , in justice to his family , and in justice to society ) to raise a certain sum of money -- on a bill . ’
212052	212060	212062	212063	Mrs. Micawber	342	‘ If no member of my family , ’
212065	212091	212062	212063	Mrs. Micawber	342	‘ is possessed of sufficient natural feeling to negotiate that bill -- I believe there is a better business - term to express what I mean-- ’
212106	212109	212092	212093	Mr. Micawber	341	‘ Discount . ’
212110	212116	212118	212119	Mrs. Micawber	342	‘ To discount that bill , ’
212121	212227	212118	212119	Mrs. Micawber	342	‘ then my opinion is , that Mr. Micawber should go into the City , should take that bill into the Money Market , and should dispose of it for what he can get . If the individuals in the Money Market oblige Mr. Micawber to sustain a great sacrifice , that is between themselves and their consciences . I view it , steadily , as an investment . I recommend Mr. Micawber , my dear Mr. Copperfield , to do the same ; to regard it as an investment which is sure of return , and to make up his mind to any sacrifice . ’
212280	212285	212287	212288	Mrs. Micawber	342	‘ I will not , ’
212310	212517	212527	212527	she	4474	‘ I will not protract these remarks on the subject of Mr. Micawber ’s pecuniary affairs . At your fireside , my dear Mr. Copperfield , and in the presence of Mr. Traddles , who , though not so old a friend , is quite one of ourselves , I could not refrain from making you acquainted with the course I advise Mr. Micawber to take . I feel that the time is arrived when Mr. Micawber should exert himself and -- I will add -- assert himself , and it appears to me that these are the means . I am aware that I am merely a female , and that a masculine judgement is usually considered more competent to the discussion of such questions ; still I must not forget that , when I lived at home with my papa and mama , my papa was in the habit of saying , “ Emma ’s form is fragile , but her grasp of a subject is inferior to none . ” That my papa was too partial , I well know ; but that he was an observer of character in some degree , my duty and my reason equally forbid me to doubt . ’
212864	212885	212841	212841	Traddles	306	‘ I am very much obliged to you indeed . And I do assure you , she ’s the dearest girl!-- ’

213762	213765	213716	213716	Traddles	306	‘ Certainly . ’

213773	213802	213771	213771	Traddles	306	‘ Yes , to be sure ! I am very much obliged to you , Copperfield ; but -- I am afraid I have lent him that already . ’
213803	213815	213816	213816	I	0	‘ For the bill that is to be a certain investment ? ’
213819	213822	213824	213824	Traddles	306	‘ No , ’
213826	213865	213824	213824	Traddles	306	‘ Not for that one . This is the first I have heard of that one . I have been thinking that he will most likely propose that one , on the way home . Mine ’s another . ’

213889	213925	213887	213887	Traddles	306	‘ I should think not , though , because he told me , only the other day , that it was provided for . That was Mr. Micawber ’s expression , “ Provided for . ” ’

214459	214504	214424	214427	another party of three	4513	’ I gave him the best idea I could , in a few words , of Mr. Micawber . He laughed heartily at my feeble portrait of that gentleman , and said he was a man to know , and he must know him . ‘
214515	214523	214524	214524	Heaven	230	’ said I , in my turn . ‘

214632	214760	214627	214627	you	0	’ I extolled Traddles in reply , as highly as I could ; for I felt that Steerforth rather slighted him . Steerforth , dismissing the subject with a light nod , and a smile , and the remark that he would be glad to see the old fellow too , for he had always been an odd fish , inquired if I could give him anything to eat ? During most of this short dialogue , when he had not been speaking in a wild vivacious manner , he had sat idly beating on the lump of coal with the poker . I observed that he did the same thing while I was getting out the remains of the pigeon - pie , and so forth . ‘

I had it in my thoughts to remonstrate with him upon his desperate way of pursuing any fancy that he took -- such as this buffeting of rough seas , and braving of hard weather , for example -- when my mind glanced off to the immediate subject of our conversation again , and pursued that instead . ‘

Finding him in this intention , I put on my own great - coat ( but did not light my own cigar , having had enough of that for one while ) and walked with him as far as the open road : a dull road , then , at night . He was in great spirits all the way ; and when we parted , and I looked after him going so gallantly and airily homeward , I thought of his saying , ‘
216308	216409	216410	216410	SIR	979	’ and wished , for the first time , that he had some worthy race to run . I was undressing in my own room , when Mr. Micawber ’s letter tumbled on the floor . Thus reminded of it , I broke the seal and read as follows . It was dated an hour and a half before dinner . I am not sure whether I have mentioned that , when Mr. Micawber was at any particularly desperate crisis , he used a sort of legal phraseology , which he seemed to think equivalent to winding up his affairs . ‘

Also , in the fact that the living responsibilities clinging to the undersigned will , in the course of nature , be increased by the sum of one more helpless victim ; whose miserable appearance may be looked for -- in round numbers -- at the expiration of a period not exceeding six lunar months from the present date . ‘

218638	218645	218647	218648	Mrs. Steerforth	419	‘ Do I constantly entreat you , ’
218650	218661	218647	218648	Mrs. Steerforth	419	‘ to speak plainly , in your own natural manner ? ’
218662	218673	218674	218674	she	4596	‘ Oh ! then this is not my natural manner ? ’
218677	218697	218647	218648	Mrs. Steerforth	419	‘ Now you must really bear with me , because I ask for information . We never know ourselves . ’

218715	218744	218708	218709	Mrs. Steerforth	419	‘ but I remember,--and so must you , I think,--when your manner was different , Rosa ; when it was not so guarded , and was more trustful . ’

219241	219523	219524	219524	She	4612	’ One other little circumstance connected with Miss Dartle I must not omit ; for I had reason to remember it thereafter , when all the irremediable past was rendered plain . During the whole of this day , but especially from this period of it , Steerforth exerted himself with his utmost skill , and that was with his utmost ease , to charm this singular creature into a pleasant and pleased companion . That he should succeed , was no matter of surprise to me . That she should struggle against the fascinating influence of his delightful art -- delightful nature I thought it then -- did not surprise me either ; for I knew that she was sometimes jaundiced and perverse . I saw her features and her manner slowly change ; I saw her look at him with growing admiration ; I saw her try , more and more faintly , but always angrily , as if she condemned a weakness in herself , to resist the captivating power that he possessed ; and finally , I saw her sharp glance soften , and her smile become quite gentle , and I ceased to be afraid of her as I had really been all day , and we all sat about the fire , talking and laughing together , with as little reserve as if we had been children . Whether it was because we had sat there so long , or because Steerforth was resolved not to lose the advantage he had gained , I do not know ; but we did not remain in the dining - room more than five minutes after her departure . ‘
219530	219543	219524	219524	She	4612	’ said Steerforth , softly , at the drawing - room door , ‘
219562	219587	219555	219555	I	0	’ He said it with a curious smile , which was gone directly ; and we went into the room and found her alone . ‘

219685	219905	219680	219680	I	0	’ He did not touch her , or the chair from which she had risen , but sat himself near the harp . She stood beside it for some little while , in a curious way , going through the motion of playing it with her right hand , but not sounding it . At length she sat down , and drew it to her with one sudden action , and played and sang . I do n’t know what it was , in her touch or voice , that made that song the most unearthly I have ever heard in my life , or can imagine . There was something fearful in the reality of it . It was as if it had never been written , or set to music , but sprung out of passion within her ; which found imperfect utterance in the low sounds of her voice , and crouched again when all was still . I was dumb when she leaned beside the harp again , playing it , but not sounding it , with her right hand . A minute more , and this had roused me from my trance:--Steerforth had left his seat , and gone to her , and had put his arm laughingly about her , and had said , ‘
219921	219949	219680	219680	I	0	’ And she had struck him , and had thrown him off with the fury of a wild cat , and had burst out of the room . ‘
219957	219965	219955	219955	Rosa	418	’ said Mrs. Steerforth , coming in . ‘
219974	219978	219972	219972	mother	10856	’ returned Steerforth , ‘

220027	220112	220124	220124	you	4623	’ Rosa did not come back ; and no other mention was made of her , until I went with Steerforth into his room to say Good night . Then he laughed about her , and asked me if I had ever seen such a fierce little piece of incomprehensibility . I expressed as much of my astonishment as was then capable of expression , and asked if he could guess what it was that she had taken so much amiss , so suddenly . ‘
220118	220122	220124	220124	you	4623	’ said Steerforth . ‘

220236	220285	220234	220234	Daisy	417	’ he said , with a smile--‘for though that ’s not the name your godfathers and godmothers gave you , it ’s the name I like best to call you by -- and I wish , I wish , I wish , you could give it to me ! ’
220286	220296	220298	220298	I.	417	‘ Why so I can , if I choose , ’

220839	220866	220833	220834	Mr. Omer	326	‘ All the better , sir . Bad habit for a young man . Take a seat . I smoke , myself , for the asthma . ’

221385	221412	221377	221377	parties	4647	’ Mr. Omer , with a very complacent and amiable face , took several puffs in silence ; and then said , resuming his first point : ‘
221415	221539	221541	221542	Mr. Omer	326	’re obleeged , in ascertaining how Barkis goes on , to limit ourselves to Em’ly . She knows what our real objects are , and she do n’t have any more alarms or suspicions about us , than if we was so many lambs . Minnie and Joram have just stepped down to the house , in fact ( she ’s there , after hours , helping her aunt a bit ) , to ask her how he is tonight ; and if you was to please to wait till they come back , they ’d give you full partic’lers . Will you take something ? A glass of srub and water , now ? I smoke on srub and water , myself , ’
221549	221576	221578	221579	Mr. Omer	326	‘ because it ’s considered softening to the passages , by which this troublesome breath of mine gets into action . But , Lord bless you , ’
221583	221620	221578	221579	Mr. Omer	326	‘ it ai n’t the passages that ’s out of order ! “ Give me breath enough , ” said I to my daughter Minnie , “ and I ’ll find passages , my dear . ” ’
221708	221713	221715	221716	Mr. Omer	326	‘ Well , sir , ’
221729	221746	221715	221716	Mr. Omer	326	‘ I tell you truly , I shall be glad when her marriage has taken place . ’

It ai n’t that she do n’t work as well as ever , for she does . She WAS worth any six , and she IS worth any six . But somehow she wants heart . If you understand , ’
221852	221906	221838	221839	Mr. Omer	326	‘ what I mean in a general way by the expression , “ A long pull , and a strong pull , and a pull altogether , my hearties , hurrah ! ” I should say to you , that that was -- in a general way -- what I miss in Em’ly . ’
221945	222008	222010	222011	Mr. Omer	326	‘ Now I consider this is principally on account of her being in an unsettled state , you see . We have talked it over a good deal , her uncle and myself , and her sweetheart and myself , after business ; and I consider it is principally on account of her being unsettled . You must always recollect of Em’ly , ’
222018	222092	222014	222014	his	326	‘ that she ’s a most extraordinary affectionate little thing . The proverb says , “ You ca n’t make a silk purse out of a sow ’s ear . ” Well , I do n’t know about that . I rather think you may , if you begin early in life . She has made a home out of that old boat , sir , that stone and marble could n’t beat . ’
222093	222100	222102	222102	I.	4651	‘ I am sure she has ! ’

If she likes to make any little arrangement , afterwards , in the way of doing any little thing for us at home , very well . If she do n’t , very well still . We ’re

Her cousin being , as it appears , in good work , and well to do , thanked me in a very manly sort of manner for this ( conducting himself altogether , I must say , in a way that gives me a high opinion of him ) , and went and took as comfortable a little house as you or I could wish to clap eyes on . That little house is now furnished right through , as neat and complete as a doll ’s parlour ; and but for Barkis ’s illness having taken this bad turn , poor fellow , they would have been man and wife -- I dare say , by this time . As it is , there ’s a postponement . ’

222639	222706	222630	222630	he	4657	‘ ca n’t naturally be expected . The prospect of the change and separation , and all that , is , as one may say , close to her and far away from her , both at once . Barkis ’s death need n’t put it off much , but his lingering might . Anyway , it ’s an uncertain state of matters , you see . ’

222722	222810	222812	222813	Mr. Omer	326	‘ Em’ly ’s still a little down , and a little fluttered ; perhaps , upon the whole , she ’s more so than she was . Every day she seems to get fonder and fonder of her uncle , and more loth to part from all of us . A kind word from me brings the tears into her eyes ; and if you was to see her with my daughter Minnie ’s little girl , you ’d never forget it . Bless my heart alive ! ’

222880	222938	222867	222867	he	326	‘ No good . A sad story , sir , however you come to know it . I never thought there was harm in the girl . I would n’t wish to mention it before my daughter Minnie -- for she ’d take me up directly -- but I never did . None of us ever did . ’

223030	223281	223002	223003	Mr. Chillip	237	’ Hall , if they were all called in together , could n’t help him . He was past both Colleges , Mr. Chillip said , and the Hall could only poison him . Hearing this , and learning that Mr. Peggotty was there , I determined to go to the house at once . I bade good night to Mr. Omer , and to Mr. and Mrs. Joram ; and directed my steps thither , with a solemn feeling , which made Mr. Barkis quite a new and different creature . My low tap at the door was answered by Mr. Peggotty . He was not so much surprised to see me as I had expected . I remarked this in Peggotty , too , when she came down ; and I have seen it since ; and I think , in the expectation of that dread surprise , all other changes and surprises dwindle into nothing . I shook hands with Mr. Peggotty , and passed into the kitchen , while he softly closed the door . Little Emily was sitting by the fire , with her hands before her face . Ham was standing near her . We spoke in whispers ; listening , between whiles , for any sound in the room above . I had not thought of it on the occasion of my last visit , but how strange it was to me , now , to miss Mr. Barkis out of the kitchen ! ‘
223292	223297	223287	223287	you	4667	’ said Mr. Peggotty . ‘
223303	223307	223287	223287	you	4667	’ said Ham . ‘
223313	223318	223287	223287	you	4667	’ cried Mr. Peggotty . ‘
223342	223412	223339	223340	Mas’r Davy	256	’ There was a trembling upon her , that I can see now . The coldness of her hand when I touched it , I can feel yet . Its only sign of animation was to shrink from mine ; and then she glided from the chair , and creeping to the other side of her uncle , bowed herself , silently and trembling still , upon his breast . ‘
223420	223435	223339	223340	Mas’r Davy	256	’ said Mr. Peggotty , smoothing her rich hair with his great hard hand , ‘
223458	223475	223476	223476	She	4670	’re new to these here trials , and timid , like my little bird,--it ’s nat’ral . ’
223495	223504	223506	223507	Mr. Peggotty	234	‘ It ’s getting late , my dear , ’
223509	223531	223506	223507	Mr. Peggotty	234	‘ and here ’s Ham come fur to take you home . Theer ! Go along with t’other loving art ! What ’
223539	223566	223536	223537	my pretty	4671	’ The sound of her voice had not reached me , but he bent his head as if he listened to her , and then said : ‘
223631	223647	223609	223610	a person	869	’ said Mr. Peggotty , looking round at both of us , with infinite pride ; ‘
223672	223673	223667	223670	a foolish little Em’ly	4680	’ ‘
223685	223689	223682	223683	Mas’r Davy	256	’ said Ham . ‘
223723	223724	223735	223735	You	256	’ ‘
223729	223734	223735	223735	You	256	’ said Mr. Peggotty . ‘
223799	223893	223796	223796	I	0	’ Ham yielded to this persuasion , and took his hat to go . Even when he kissed her -- and I never saw him approach her , but I felt that nature had given him the soul of a gentleman -- she seemed to cling closer to her uncle , even to the avoidance of her chosen husband . I shut the door after him , that it might cause no disturbance of the quiet that prevailed ; and when I turned back , I found Mr. Peggotty still talking to her . ‘
223897	223920	223921	223921	he	0	’m a going upstairs to tell your aunt as Mas’r Davy ’s here , and that ’ll cheer her up a bit , ’
223924	223998	224000	224001	Mr. Peggotty	234	‘ Sit ye down by the fire , the while , my dear , and warm those mortal cold hands . You doen’t need to be so fearsome , and take on so much . What ? You ’ll go along with me?--Well ! come along with me -- come ! If her uncle was turned out of house and home , and forced to lay down in a dyke , Mas’r Davy , ’
224010	224038	224000	224001	Mr. Peggotty	234	‘ it ’s my belief she ’d go along with him , now ! But there ’ll be someone else , soon,--someone else , soon , Em’ly ! ’
224447	224451	224437	224437	he	4689	‘ Old clothes ! ’
224452	224458	224460	224460	Peggotty	234	‘ Barkis , my dear ! ’
224481	224519	224520	224520	He	4689	‘ Here ’s my dear boy -- my dear boy , Master Davy , who brought us together , Barkis ! That you sent messages by , you know ! Wo n’t you speak to Master Davy ? ’
224541	224551	224553	224554	Mr. Peggotty	234	‘ He ’s a going out with the tide , ’
224580	224585	224574	224574	I	0	‘ With the tide ? ’
224586	224596	224598	224599	Mr. Peggotty	234	‘ People ca n’t die , along the coast , ’
224601	224680	224598	224599	Mr. Peggotty	234	‘ except when the tide ’s pretty nigh out . They ca n’t be born , unless it ’s pretty nigh in -- not properly born , till flood . He ’s a going out with the tide . It ’s ebb at half - arter three , slack water half an hour . If he lives till it turns , he ’ll hold his own till past the flood , and go out with the next tide . ’
224738	224745	224747	224747	Peggotty	234	‘ He ’s coming to himself , ’
224762	224772	224749	224750	Mr. Peggotty	234	‘ They are both a - going out fast . ’
224773	224779	224781	224781	Peggotty	234	‘ Barkis , my dear ! ’
224783	224788	224789	224789	he	234	‘ C. P. Barkis , ’
224793	224799	224789	224789	he	234	‘ No better woman anywhere ! ’
224800	224808	224810	224810	Peggotty	234	‘ Look ! Here ’s Master Davy ! ’
224853	224857	224833	224833	he	4689	‘ Barkis is willin ’
224859	224942	224943	224945	her sweet girl	4697	’ And , it being low water , he went out with the tide . CHAPTER 31 . A GREATER LOSS It was not difficult for me , on Peggotty ’s solicitation , to resolve to stay where I was , until after the remains of the poor carrier should have made their last journey to Blunderstone . She had long ago bought , out of her own savings , a little piece of ground in our old churchyard near the grave of ‘
224946	225300	225301	225302	Mr. Blackboy	512	’ , as she always called my mother ; and there they were to rest . In keeping Peggotty company , and doing all I could for her ( little enough at the utmost ) , I was as grateful , I rejoice to think , as even now I could wish myself to have been . But I am afraid I had a supreme satisfaction , of a personal and professional nature , in taking charge of Mr. Barkis ’s will , and expounding its contents . I may claim the merit of having originated the suggestion that the will should be looked for in the box . After some search , it was found in the box , at the bottom of a horse ’s nose - bag ; wherein ( besides hay ) there was discovered an old gold watch , with chain and seals , which Mr. Barkis had worn on his wedding - day , and which had never been seen before or since ; a silver tobacco - stopper , in the form of a leg ; an imitation lemon , full of minute cups and saucers , which I have some idea Mr. Barkis must have purchased to present to me when I was a child , and afterwards found himself unable to part with ; eighty - seven guineas and a half , in guineas and half - guineas ; two hundred and ten pounds , in perfectly clean Bank notes ; certain receipts for Bank of England stock ; an old horseshoe , a bad shilling , a piece of camphor , and an oyster - shell . From the circumstance of the latter article having been much polished , and displaying prismatic colours on the inside , I conclude that Mr. Barkis had some general ideas about pearls , which never resolved themselves into anything definite . For years and years , Mr. Barkis had carried this box , on all his journeys , every day . That it might the better escape notice , he had invented a fiction that it belonged to ‘
225303	225307	225301	225302	Mr. Blackboy	512	’ , and was ‘
225316	226257	226258	226258	You	4698	’ ; a fable he had elaborately written on the lid , in characters now scarcely legible . He had hoarded , all these years , I found , to good purpose . His property in money amounted to nearly three thousand pounds . Of this he bequeathed the interest of one thousand to Mr. Peggotty for his life ; on his decease , the principal to be equally divided between Peggotty , little Emily , and me , or the survivor or survivors of us , share and share alike . All the rest he died possessed of , he bequeathed to Peggotty ; whom he left residuary legatee , and sole executrix of that his last will and testament . I felt myself quite a proctor when I read this document aloud with all possible ceremony , and set forth its provisions , any number of times , to those whom they concerned . I began to think there was more in the Commons than I had supposed . I examined the will with the deepest attention , pronounced it perfectly formal in all respects , made a pencil - mark or so in the margin , and thought it rather extraordinary that I knew so much . In this abstruse pursuit ; in making an account for Peggotty , of all the property into which she had come ; in arranging all the affairs in an orderly manner ; and in being her referee and adviser on every point , to our joint delight ; I passed the week before the funeral . I did not see little Emily in that interval , but they told me she was to be quietly married in a fortnight . I did not attend the funeral in character , if I may venture to say so . I mean I was not dressed up in a black coat and a streamer , to frighten the birds ; but I walked over to Blunderstone early in the morning , and was in the churchyard when it came , attended only by Peggotty and her brother . The mad gentleman looked on , out of my little window ; Mr. Chillip ’s baby wagged its heavy head , and rolled its goggle eyes , at the clergyman , over its nurse ’s shoulder ; Mr. Omer breathed short in the background ; no one else was there ; and it was very quiet . We walked about the churchyard for an hour , after all was over ; and pulled some young leaves from the tree above my mother ’s grave . A dread falls on me here . A cloud is lowering on the distant town , towards which I retraced my solitary steps . I fear to approach it . I can not bear to think of what did come , upon that memorable night ; of what must come again , if I go on . It is no worse , because I write of it . It would be no better , if I stopped my most unwilling hand . It is done . Nothing can undo it ; nothing can make it otherwise than as it was . My old nurse was to go to London with me next day , on the business of the will . Little Emily was passing that day at Mr. Omer ’s . We were all to meet in the old boathouse that night . Ham would bring Emily at the usual hour . I would walk back at my leisure . The brother and sister would return as they had come , and be expecting us , when the day closed in , at the fireside . I parted from them at the wicket - gate , where visionary Strap had rested with Roderick Random ’s knapsack in the days of yore ; and , instead of going straight back , walked a little distance on the road to Lowestoft . Then I turned , and walked back towards Yarmouth . I stayed to dine at a decent alehouse , some mile or two from the Ferry I have mentioned before ; and thus the day wore away , and it was evening when I reached it . Rain was falling heavily by that time , and it was a wild night ; but there was a moon behind the clouds , and it was not dark . I was soon within sight of Mr. Peggotty ’s house , and of the light within it shining through the window . A little floundering across the sand , which was heavy , brought me to the door , and I went in . It looked very comfortable indeed . Mr. Peggotty had smoked his evening pipe and there were preparations for some supper by and by . The fire was bright , the ashes were thrown up , the locker was ready for little Emily in her old place . In her own old place sat Peggotty , once more , looking ( but for her dress ) as if she had never left it . She had fallen back , already , on the society of the work - box with St. Paul ’s upon the lid , the yard - measure in the cottage , and the bit of wax - candle ; and there they all were , just as if they had never been disturbed . Mrs. Gummidge appeared to be fretting a little , in her old corner ; and consequently looked quite natural , too . ‘
226259	226268	226270	226271	Mr. Peggotty	234	’re first of the lot , Mas’r Davy ! ’
226277	226291	226270	226271	Mr. Peggotty	234	‘ Doen’t keep in that coat , sir , if it ’s wet . ’
226292	226299	226301	226301	I	0	‘ Thank you , Mr. Peggotty , ’
226312	226318	226301	226301	I	0	‘ It ’s quite dry . ’

226324	226333	226270	226271	Mr. Peggotty	234	’ said Mr. Peggotty , feeling my shoulders . ‘
226348	226358	226301	226301	I	0	’ no use saying welcome to you , but you ’re

226407	226439	226443	226447	a woman in the wureld	4702	’ laughed Mr. Peggotty , sitting down beside us , and rubbing his hands in his sense of relief from recent trouble , and in the genuine heartiness of his nature ; ‘
226510	226515	226493	226493	she	4701	’ Mrs. Gummidge groaned . ‘
226523	226557	226493	226493	she	4701	’ said Mr. Peggotty . ( But he shook his head aside at us , evidently sensible of the tendency of the late occurrences to recall the memory of the old one . ) ‘

226594	226599	226592	226592	Dan’l	272	’ returned Mrs. Gummidge . ‘

227693	227742	227743	227743	Ham	236	’ We went out . As I passed him at the door , I saw , to my astonishment and fright , that he was deadly pale . He pushed me hastily into the open air , and closed the door upon us . Only upon us two . ‘

229595	230239	230240	230240	We	4754	’ He was quite passive now ; and when I heard him crying , the impulse that had been upon me to go down upon my knees , and ask their pardon for the desolation I had caused , and curse Steerforth , yielded to a better feeling . My overcharged heart found the same relief , and I cried too . CHAPTER 32 . THE BEGINNING OF A LONG JOURNEY What is natural in me , is natural in many other men , I infer , and so I am not afraid to write that I never had loved Steerforth better than when the ties that bound me to him were broken . In the keen distress of the discovery of his unworthiness , I thought more of all that was brilliant in him , I softened more towards all that was good in him , I did more justice to the qualities that might have made him a man of a noble nature and a great name , than ever I had done in the height of my devotion to him . Deeply as I felt my own unconscious part in his pollution of an honest home , I believed that if I had been brought face to face with him , I could not have uttered one reproach . I should have loved him so well still -- though he fascinated me no longer -- I should have held in so much tenderness the memory of my affection for him , that I think I should have been as weak as a spirit - wounded child , in all but the entertainment of a thought that we could ever be re - united . That thought I never had . I felt , as he had felt , that all was at an end between us . What his remembrances of me were , I have never known -- they were light enough , perhaps , and easily dismissed -- but mine of him were as the remembrances of a cherished friend , who was dead . Yes , Steerforth , long removed from the scenes of this poor history ! My sorrow may bear involuntary witness against you at the judgement Throne ; but my angry thoughts or my reproaches never will , I know ! The news of what had happened soon spread through the town ; insomuch that as I passed along the streets next morning , I overheard the people speaking of it at their doors . Many were hard upon her , some few were hard upon him , but towards her second father and her lover there was but one sentiment . Among all kinds of people a respect for them in their distress prevailed , which was full of gentleness and delicacy . The seafaring men kept apart , when those two were seen early , walking with slow steps on the beach ; and stood in knots , talking compassionately among themselves . It was on the beach , close down by the sea , that I found them . It would have been easy to perceive that they had not slept all last night , even if Peggotty had failed to tell me of their still sitting just as I left them , when it was broad day . They looked worn ; and I thought Mr. Peggotty ’s head was bowed in one night more than in all the years I had known him . But they were both as grave and steady as the sea itself , then lying beneath a dark sky , waveless -- yet with a heavy roll upon it , as if it breathed in its rest -- and touched , on the horizon , with a strip of silvery light from the unseen sun . ‘
230250	230269	230240	230240	We	4754	’ said Mr. Peggotty to me , when we had all three walked a little while in silence , ‘
230287	230350	230355	230355	sir	979	’ I happened to glance at Ham , then looking out to sea upon the distant light , and a frightful thought came into my mind -- not that his face was angry , for it was not ; I recall nothing but an expression of stern determination in it -- that if ever he encountered Steerforth , he would kill him . ‘
230357	230362	230355	230355	sir	979	’ said Mr. Peggotty , ‘
230367	230373	230374	230374	he	979	’m a going to seek my-- ’
230385	230387	230374	230374	he	979	‘ I ’m

230468	230472	230459	230459	I	0	’ he rejoined , ‘
230475	230480	230481	230481	We	4759	’re agreeable , tomorrow . ’
230492	230495	230496	230496	he	0	‘ Ham , ’
230500	230522	230496	230496	he	0	‘ he ’ll hold to his present work , and go and live along with my sister . The old boat yonder-- ’
230523	230534	230535	230535	I	0	‘ Will you desert the old boat , Mr. Peggotty ? ’
230539	230546	230547	230547	he	0	‘ My station , Mas’r Davy , ’
230550	230601	230547	230547	he	0	‘ ai n’t there no longer ; and if ever a boat foundered , since there was darkness on the face of the deep , that one ’s gone down . But no , sir , no ; I doen’t mean as it should be deserted . Fur from that . ’
230616	230682	230613	230613	he	0	‘ My wishes is , sir , as it shall look , day and night , winter and summer , as it has always looked , since she fust know’d it . If ever she should come a wandering back , I would n’t have the old place seem to cast her off , you understand , but seem to tempt her to draw nigher to ‘
230724	230765	230766	230766	I	0	’ none but Missis Gummidge there , she might take heart to creep in , trembling ; and might come to be laid down in her old bed , and rest her weary head where it was once so gay . ’
230779	230783	230785	230786	Mr. Peggotty	234	‘ Every night , ’
230788	230876	230877	230877	He	0	‘ as reg’lar as the night comes , the candle must be stood in its old pane of glass , that if ever she should see it , it may seem to say “ Come back , my child , come back ! ” If ever there ’s a knock , Ham ( partic’ler a soft knock ) , arter dark , at your aunt ’s door , doen’t you go nigh it . Let it be her -- not you -- that sees my fallen child ! ’
230971	230985	230968	230968	he	236	‘ On what ’s afore me , Mas’r Davy ; and over yon . ’
230986	230997	230998	230998	He	236	‘ On the life before you , do you mean ? ’
231006	231017	230998	230998	He	236	‘ Ay , Mas’r Davy . I doen’t rightly know how ‘
231037	231054	230968	230968	he	236	’ looking at me as if he were waking , but with the same determined face . ‘
231058	231068	231069	231069	I	0	’ I asked , possessed by my former fear . ‘
231073	231079	231069	231069	I	0	’ he said , thoughtfully ; ‘
231110	231123	231124	231124	you	256	’ he added ; answering , as I think , my look ; ‘
231136	231265	231124	231124	you	256	’m kiender muddled ; I do n’t fare to feel no matters,’--which was as much as to say that he was not himself , and quite confounded . Mr. Peggotty stopping for us to join him : we did so , and said no more . The remembrance of this , in connexion with my former thought , however , haunted me at intervals , even until the inexorable end came at its appointed time . We insensibly approached the old boat , and entered . Mrs. Gummidge , no longer moping in her especial corner , was busy preparing breakfast . She took Mr. Peggotty ’s hat , and placed his seat for him , and spoke so comfortably and softly , that I hardly knew her . ‘
231272	231276	231124	231124	you	256	’ said she , ‘
231314	231320	231307	231307	I	0	’ she meant her chattering , ‘
231332	231392	231328	231328	I	0	’ When she had served us all , she withdrew to the window , where she sedulously employed herself in repairing some shirts and other clothes belonging to Mr. Peggotty , and neatly folding and packing them in an old oilskin bag , such as sailors carry . Meanwhile , she continued talking , in the same quiet manner : ‘
231403	231408	231398	231398	you	272	’ said Mrs. Gummidge , ‘
231420	231426	231398	231398	you	272	’ to your wishes . I ’m

232287	232419	232284	232285	Mrs. Joram	330	‘ has only just now been got to sleep . Even in her sleep she is sobbing for Em’ly . All day long , little Minnie has cried for her , and asked me , over and over again , whether Em’ly was wicked ? What can I say to her , when Em’ly tied a ribbon off her own neck round little Minnie ’s the last night she was here , and laid her head down on the pillow beside her till she was fast asleep ! The ribbon ’s round my little Minnie ’s neck now . It ought not to be , perhaps , but what can I do ? Em’ly is very bad , but they were fond of one another . And the child knows nothing ! ’

I remembered very well what she referred to , having had it in my thoughts many times that day . I told her so . ‘
233946	233963	233944	233944	him	4826	’ said the little woman , holding up her forefinger between me and her sparkling eyes , ‘

234009	234030	234004	234007	blind ill - fortune	4830	’ cried Miss Mowcher , wringing her hands impatiently , as she went to and fro again upon the fender , ‘
234045	234068	234033	234033	you	11434	’ I could not conceal from myself that I had done this , though for a reason very different from her supposition . ‘
234074	234111	234112	234112	He	4831	’ said Miss Mowcher , taking out her handkerchief again , and giving one little stamp on the ground whenever , at short intervals , she applied it to her eyes with both hands at once . ‘
234341	234367	234331	234331	They	4837	’ exclaimed Miss Mowcher , getting off the fender , and trotting up and down the kitchen with her two short arms distressfully lifted up , ‘

234493	234499	234489	234489	My	0	’ she added at length , ‘
234574	234652	234653	234653	I	0	’ Poor little Mowcher turned so chilly after all her crying and fretting , that she turned round on the fender , putting her poor little wet feet in among the ashes to warm them , and sat looking at the fire , like a large doll . I sat in a chair on the other side of the hearth , lost in unhappy reflections , and looking at the fire too , and sometimes at her . ‘

234819	234876	234809	234811	my good friend	4848	’ She had got over the fender now , and I had got over my suspicion . I told her that I believed she had given me a faithful account of herself , and that we had both been hapless instruments in designing hands . She thanked me , and said I was a good fellow . ‘

But if ever they return , if ever any one of them returns , while I am alive , I am more likely than another , going about as I do , to find it out soon . Whatever I know , you shall know . If ever I can do anything to serve the poor betrayed girl , I will do it faithfully , please Heaven ! And Littimer had better have a bloodhound at his back , than little Mowcher ! ’

Perhaps you wo n’t , then , be very hard upon me , or surprised if I can be distressed and serious . Good night ! ’

235511	235574	235576	235576	he	4856	’m in good employ , you know , Mas’r Davy , and I han’t no way now of spending what I gets . Money ’s of no use to me no more , except to live . If you can lay it out for him , I shall do my work with a better art . Though as to that , sir , ’
235583	235585	235576	235576	he	4856	‘ you ’re
235611	235648	235651	235651	sir	979	’ I told him I was well convinced of it ; and I hinted that I hoped the time might even come , when he would cease to lead the lonely life he naturally contemplated now . ‘
235653	235661	235651	235651	sir	979	’ he said , shaking his head , ‘
235706	236529	235685	235685	you	979	’ Reminding him of the fact , that Mr. Peggotty derived a steady , though certainly a very moderate income from the bequest of his late brother - in - law , I promised to do so . We then took leave of each other . I can not leave him even now , without remembering with a pang , at once his modest fortitude and his great sorrow . As to Mrs. Gummidge , if I were to endeavour to describe how she ran down the street by the side of the coach , seeing nothing but Mr. Peggotty on the roof , through the tears she tried to repress , and dashing herself against the people who were coming in the opposite direction , I should enter on a task of some difficulty . Therefore I had better leave her sitting on a baker ’s door - step , out of breath , with no shape at all remaining in her bonnet , and one of her shoes off , lying on the pavement at a considerable distance . When we got to our journey ’s end , our first pursuit was to look about for a little lodging for Peggotty , where her brother could have a bed . We were so fortunate as to find one , of a very clean and cheap description , over a chandler ’s shop , only two streets removed from me . When we had engaged this domicile , I bought some cold meat at an eating - house , and took my fellow - travellers home to tea ; a proceeding , I regret to state , which did not meet with Mrs. Crupp ’s approval , but quite the contrary . I ought to observe , however , in explanation of that lady ’s state of mind , that she was much offended by Peggotty ’s tucking up her widow ’s gown before she had been ten minutes in the place , and setting to work to dust my bedroom . This Mrs. Crupp regarded in the light of a liberty , and a liberty , she said , was a thing she never allowed . Mr. Peggotty had made a communication to me on the way to London for which I was not unprepared . It was , that he purposed first seeing Mrs. Steerforth . As I felt bound to assist him in this , and also to mediate between them ; with the view of sparing the mother ’s feelings as much as possible , I wrote to her that night . I told her as mildly as I could what his wrong was , and what my own share in his injury . I said he was a man in very common life , but of a most gentle and upright character ; and that I ventured to express a hope that she would not refuse to see him in his heavy trouble . I mentioned two o’clock in the afternoon as the hour of our coming , and I sent the letter myself by the first coach in the morning . At the appointed time , we stood at the door -- the door of that house where I had been , a few days since , so happy : where my youthful confidence and warmth of heart had been yielded up so freely : which was closed against me henceforth : which was now a waste , a ruin . No Littimer appeared . The pleasanter face which had replaced his , on the occasion of my last visit , answered to our summons , and went before us to the drawing - room . Mrs. Steerforth was sitting there . Rosa Dartle glided , as we went in , from another part of the room and stood behind her chair . I saw , directly , in his mother ’s face , that she knew from himself what he had done . It was very pale ; and bore the traces of deeper emotion than my letter alone , weakened by the doubts her fondness would have raised upon it , would have been likely to create . I thought her more like him than ever I had thought her ; and I felt , rather than saw , that the resemblance was not lost on my companion . She sat upright in her arm - chair , with a stately , immovable , passionless air , that it seemed as if nothing could disturb . She looked very steadfastly at Mr. Peggotty when he stood before her ; and he looked quite as steadfastly at her . Rosa Dartle ’s keen glance comprehended all of us . For some moments not a word was spoken . She motioned to Mr. Peggotty to be seated . He said , in a low voice , ‘
236551	236565	236566	236566	I	0	’ And this was succeeded by another silence , which she broke thus : ‘
236594	236626	236588	236588	you	0	’ He put his hat under his arm , and feeling in his breast for Emily ’s letter , took it out , unfolded it , and gave it to her . ‘
236641	236668	236671	236671	he	0	’ She read it , in the same stately and impassive way,--untouched by its contents , as far as I could see,--and returned it to him . ‘
236679	236692	236693	236693	I	0	’ said Mr. Peggotty , tracing out that part with his finger . ‘

236711	236715	236693	236693	I	0	’ she returned . ‘

236776	236781	236773	236773	she	8849	’ said Mr. Peggotty . ‘
236790	236801	236759	236759	She	8849	’m no judge of them things . Teach her better ! ’
236802	236835	236773	236773	she	8849	‘ Since you oblige me to speak more plainly , which I am very unwilling to do , her humble connexions would render such a thing impossible , if nothing else did . ’
236836	236843	236844	236844	he	0	‘ Hark to this , ma’am , ’
236851	237041	236844	236844	he	0	‘ You know what it is to love your child . So do I. If she was a hundred times my child , I could n’t love her more . You doen’t know what it is to lose your child . I do . All the heaps of riches in the wureld would be nowt to me ( if they was mine ) to buy her back ! But , save her from this disgrace , and she shall never be disgraced by us . Not one of us that she ’s growed up among , not one of us that ’s lived along with her and had her for their all in all , these many year , will ever look upon her pritty face again . We ’ll be content to let her be ; we ’ll be content to think of her , far off , as if she was underneath another sun and sky ; we ’ll be content to trust her to her husband,--to her little children , p’raps,--and bide the time when all of us shall be alike in quality afore our God ! ’
237079	237140	237076	237076	she	4872	‘ I justify nothing . I make no counter - accusations . But I am sorry to repeat , it is impossible . Such a marriage would irretrievably blight my son ’s career , and ruin his prospects . Nothing is more certain than that it never can take place , and never will . If there is any other compensation-- ’
237141	237152	237154	237155	Mr. Peggotty	234	‘ I am looking at the likeness of the face , ’
237165	237255	237256	237256	She	4873	‘ that has looked at me , in my home , at my fireside , in my boat -- wheer not?---smiling and friendly , when it was so treacherous , that I go half wild when I think of it . If the likeness of that face do n’t turn to burning fire , at the thought of offering money to me for my child ’s blight and ruin , it ’s as bad . I doen’t know , being a lady ’s , but what it ’s worse . ’
237290	237323	237272	237272	she	4873	‘ What compensation can you make to ME for opening such a pit between me and my son ? What is your love to mine ? What is your separation to ours ? ’
237346	237486	237272	237272	she	4873	‘ No , Rosa , not a word ! Let the man listen to what I say ! My son , who has been the object of my life , to whom its every thought has been devoted , whom I have gratified from a child in every wish , from whom I have had no separate existence since his birth,--to take up in a moment with a miserable girl , and avoid me ! To repay my confidence with systematic deception , for her sake , and quit me for her ! To set this wretched fancy , against his mother ’s claims upon his duty , love , respect , gratitude -- claims that every day and hour of his life should have strengthened into ties that nothing could be proof against ! Is this no injury ? ’
237498	237661	237662	237662	she	4874	‘ I say , Rosa , not a word ! If he can stake his all upon the lightest object , I can stake my all upon a greater purpose . Let him go where he will , with the means that my love has secured to him ! Does he think to reduce me by long absence ? He knows his mother very little if he does . Let him put away his whim now , and he is welcome back . Let him not put her away now , and he never shall come near me , living or dying , while I can raise my hand to make a sign against it , unless , being rid of her for ever , he comes humbly to me and begs for my forgiveness . This is my right . This is the acknowledgement I WILL HAVE . This is the separation that there is between us ! And is this , ’
237680	237684	237662	237662	she	4874	‘ no injury ? ’
237824	237843	237844	237844	he	234	‘ Doen’t fear me being any hindrance to you , I have no more to say , ma’am , ’

I have done what I thowt should be done , but I never looked fur any good to come of my stan’ning where I do . This has been too evil a house fur me and mine , fur me to be in my right senses and expect it . ’

If I ever could reproach her with her infamous condition , I would go anywhere to do so . If I could hunt her to her grave , I would .

She informed me , in return , that he had said the same to her that morning . She knew no more than I did , where he was going , but she thought he had some project shaped out in his mind . I did not like to leave him , under such circumstances , and we all three dined together off a beefsteak pie -- which was one of the many good things for which Peggotty was famous -- and which was curiously flavoured on this occasion , I recollect well , by a miscellaneous taste of tea , coffee , butter , bacon , cheese , new loaves , firewood , candles , and walnut ketchup , continually ascending from the shop . After dinner we sat for an hour or so near the window , without talking much ; and then Mr. Peggotty got up , and brought his oilskin bag and his stout stick , and laid them on the table . He accepted , from his sister ’s stock of ready money , a small sum on account of his legacy ; barely enough , I should have thought , to keep him for a month . He promised to communicate with me , when anything befell him ; and he slung his bag about him , took his hat and stick , and bade us both ‘

It was a warm , dusty evening , just the time when , in the great main thoroughfare out of which that by - way turned , there was a temporary lull in the eternal tread of feet upon the pavement , and a strong red sunshine . He turned , alone , at the corner of our shady street , into a glow of light , in which we lost him . Rarely did that hour of the evening come , rarely did I wake at night , rarely did I look up at the moon , or stars , or watch the falling rain , or hear the wind , but I thought of his solitary figure toiling on , poor pilgrim , and recalled the words : ‘
239315	239361	239314	239314	I	0	’m a going to seek her , fur and wide . If any hurt should come to me , remember that the last words I left for her was , “ My unchanged love is with my darling child , and I forgive her ! ” ’

Therefore she begged to be excused from any further attendance on the top set , until things were as they formerly was , and as they could be wished to be ; and further mentioned that her little book would be found upon the breakfast - table every Saturday morning , when she requested an immediate settlement of the same , with the benevolent view of saving trouble ‘

I have no doubt Mr. Micawber would have paid it if he could , but he could not . One thing I ought to mention , which I like very much in Mr. Micawber , Copperfield .

I noticed how her eye lighted on me , when she thought my attention otherwise occupied ; and what a curious process of hesitation appeared to be going on within her , while she preserved her outward stiffness and composure . I began to reflect whether I had done anything to offend her ; and my conscience whispered me that I had not yet told her about Dora . Could it by any means be that , I wondered ! As I knew she would only speak in her own good time , I sat down near her , and spoke to the birds , and played with the cat , and was as easy as I could be . But I was very far from being really easy ; and I should still have been so , even if Mr. Dick , leaning over the great kite behind my aunt , had not taken every secret opportunity of shaking his head darkly at me , and pointing at her . ‘

DEPRESSION As soon as I could recover my presence of mind , which quite deserted me in the first overpowering shock of my aunt ’s intelligence , I proposed to Mr. Dick to come round to the chandler ’s shop , and take possession of the bed which Mr. Peggotty had lately vacated . The chandler ’s shop being in Hungerford Market , and Hungerford Market being a very different place in those days , there was a low wooden colonnade before the door ( not very unlike that before the house where the little man and woman used to live , in the old weather - glass ) , which pleased Mr. Dick mightily . The glory of lodging over this structure would have compensated him , I dare say , for many inconveniences ; but , as there were really few to bear , beyond the compound of flavours I have already mentioned , and perhaps the want of a little more elbow - room , he was perfectly charmed with his accommodation . Mrs. Crupp had indignantly assured him that there was n’t room to swing a cat there ; but , as Mr. Dick justly observed to me , sitting down on the foot of the bed , nursing his leg , ‘
252329	252390	252327	252327	ME	0	’ I tried to ascertain whether Mr. Dick had any understanding of the causes of this sudden and great change in my aunt ’s affairs . As I might have expected , he had none at all . The only account he could give of it was , that my aunt had said to him , the day before yesterday , ‘
252407	252427	252428	252428	Dick	363	’ That then he had said , Yes , he hoped so . That then my aunt had said , ‘
252434	252441	252428	252428	Dick	363	’ That then he had said , ‘
252446	252669	252428	252428	Dick	363	’ That then my aunt had praised him highly , which he was glad of . And that then they had come to me , and had had bottled porter and sandwiches on the road . Mr. Dick was so very complacent , sitting on the foot of the bed , nursing his leg , and telling me this , with his eyes wide open and a surprised smile , that I am sorry to say I was provoked into explaining to him that ruin meant distress , want , and starvation ; but I was soon bitterly reproved for this harshness , by seeing his face turn pale , and tears course down his lengthened cheeks , while he fixed upon me a look of such unutterable woe , that it might have softened a far harder heart than mine . I took infinitely greater pains to cheer him up again than I had taken to depress him ; and I soon understood ( as I ought to have known at first ) that he had been so confident , merely because of his faith in the wisest and most wonderful of women , and his unbounded reliance on my intellectual resources . The latter , I believe , he considered a match for any kind of disaster not absolutely mortal . ‘
252677	252682	252675	252675	Trotwood	228	’ said Mr. Dick . ‘
252687	252688	252685	252686	the Memorial-	5217	’ ‘
252695	252698	252685	252686	the Memorial-	5217	’ said I. ‘
252730	253068	252720	252721	my aunt	731	’ He assented to this in the most earnest manner ; and implored me , if I should see him wandering an inch out of the right course , to recall him by some of those superior methods which were always at my command . But I regret to state that the fright I had given him proved too much for his best attempts at concealment . All the evening his eyes wandered to my aunt ’s face , with an expression of the most dismal apprehension , as if he saw her growing thin on the spot . He was conscious of this , and put a constraint upon his head ; but his keeping that immovable , and sitting rolling his eyes like a piece of machinery , did not mend the matter at all . I saw him look at the loaf at supper ( which happened to be a small one ) , as if nothing else stood between us and famine ; and when my aunt insisted on his making his customary repast , I detected him in the act of pocketing fragments of his bread and cheese ; I have no doubt for the purpose of reviving us with those savings , when we should have reached an advanced stage of attenuation . My aunt , on the other hand , was in a composed frame of mind , which was a lesson to all of us -- to me , I am sure . She was extremely gracious to Peggotty , except when I inadvertently called her by that name ; and , strange as I knew she felt in London , appeared quite at home . She was to have my bed , and I was to lie in the sitting - room , to keep guard over her . She made a great point of being so near the river , in case of a conflagration ; and I suppose really did find some satisfaction in that circumstance . ‘
253074	253093	252720	252721	my aunt	731	’ said my aunt , when she saw me making preparations for compounding her usual night - draught , ‘

253102	253103	253100	253100	aunt	2261	’ ‘

253141	253146	253123	253123	you	2261	’ said my aunt . ‘
253164	253308	253309	253310	My dear	854	’ I thought Mr. Dick would have fallen , insensible . My aunt being resolute , I went out and got the ale myself . As it was growing late , Peggotty and Mr. Dick took that opportunity of repairing to the chandler ’s shop together . I parted from him , poor fellow , at the corner of the street , with his great kite at his back , a very monument of human misery . My aunt was walking up and down the room when I returned , crimping the borders of her nightcap with her fingers . I warmed the ale and made the toast on the usual infallible principles . When it was ready for her , she was ready for it , with her nightcap on , and the skirt of her gown turned back on her knees . ‘
253312	253324	253309	253310	My dear	854	’ said my aunt , after taking a spoonful of it ; ‘
253339	253350	253355	253355	child	8492	’ I suppose I looked doubtful , for she added : ‘
253371	253372	253373	253373	I	0	’ ‘
253385	253388	253381	253381	I	0	’ said I. ‘
253399	253404	253395	253395	you	854	’ said my aunt . ‘
253414	253418	253410	253412	very different people	5229	’ I returned . ‘
253425	253469	253423	253423	Trot	370	’ replied my aunt . My aunt went on with a quiet enjoyment , in which there was very little affectation , if any ; drinking the warm ale with a tea - spoon , and soaking her strips of toast in it . ‘
253472	253476	253423	253423	Trot	370	’ said she , ‘
253500	253501	253494	253494	yours	370	’ ‘
253515	253518	253511	253511	you	2261	’ said I. ‘
253526	253535	253511	253511	you	2261	’ observed my aunt , rubbing her nose ; ‘
253574	253575	253577	253577	she	11485	’ ‘
253589	253592	253577	253577	she	11485	’ said I. ‘
253597	253607	253577	253577	she	11485	’ returned my aunt , rather grudging the admission ; ‘
253635	253636	253626	253626	Barkis	294	’ ‘
253648	253651	253640	253640	she	11485	’ said I. ‘
253657	253662	253654	253654	I	0	’ returned my aunt . ‘
253693	253709	253690	253691	A simpleton	5235	’ My aunt ’s tears of pleasure were positively trickling down into the warm ale . ‘
253721	253726	253710	253710	She	11485	’ said my aunt . ‘
253767	253799	253765	253765	Barkis	294	’ Affecting to laugh , she got an opportunity of putting her hand to her eyes . Having availed herself of it , she resumed her toast and her discourse together . ‘
253806	253811	253765	253765	Barkis	294	’ sighed my aunt . ‘
253871	253890	253859	253859	they	5240	’ said my aunt ; an idea which was probably suggested to her by her contemplation of mine . ‘
253894	253897	253891	253892	Poor Emily	268	’ said I. ‘
253908	253913	253914	253914	She	5241	’ returned my aunt . ‘
253943	253963	253966	253966	Trot	370	’ As I bent forward , she put her tumbler on my knee to detain me , and said : ‘
253981	253982	253979	253979	you	370	’ ‘
253987	253998	253985	253985	aunt	2261	’ I exclaimed , as red as I could be . ‘

254013	254018	254009	254009	Dora	488	’ returned my aunt . ‘

254074	254122	254072	254072	aunt	2261	’ I seriously believe it had never once entered my head for a single moment , to consider whether she was or not . I resented the idea , of course ; but I was in a manner struck by it , as a new one altogether . ‘
254128	254133	254138	254138	aunt	2261	’ said my aunt . ‘
254140	254163	254138	254138	aunt	2261	’ I could only repeat this daring speculation with the same kind of feeling with which I had repeated the preceding question . ‘
254168	254173	254138	254138	aunt	2261	’ said my aunt . ‘
254226	254253	254222	254222	you	5248	’ She asked me this so kindly , and with such a gentle air , half playful and half sorrowful , that I was quite touched . ‘
254265	254269	254260	254260	aunt	2261	’ I replied ; ‘
254346	254347	254343	254343	I	0	’ ‘
254352	254365	254350	254350	Trot	370	’ said my aunt , shaking her head , and smiling gravely ; ‘
254372	254373	254343	254343	I	0	’ ‘
254381	254390	254379	254379	Trot	370	’ my aunt pursued , after a pause , ‘
254437	254438	254457	254457	Trot	370	’ ‘
254450	254454	254457	254457	Trot	370	’ I cried . ‘
254459	254464	254457	254457	Trot	370	’ she said again ; ‘
254469	254491	254457	254457	Trot	370	’ and without knowing why , I felt a vague unhappy loss or want of something overshadow me like a cloud . ‘
254494	254499	254457	254457	Trot	370	’ said my aunt , ‘
254580	255197	255198	255199	Poor boy	5264	’ This was not upon the whole very comforting to a rapturous lover ; but I was glad to have my aunt in my confidence , and I was mindful of her being fatigued . So I thanked her ardently for this mark of her affection , and for all her other kindnesses towards me ; and after a tender good night , she took her nightcap into my bedroom . How miserable I was , when I lay down ! How I thought and thought about my being poor , in Mr. Spenlow ’s eyes ; about my not being what I thought I was , when I proposed to Dora ; about the chivalrous necessity of telling Dora what my worldly condition was , and releasing her from her engagement if she thought fit ; about how I should contrive to live , during the long term of my articles , when I was earning nothing ; about doing something to assist my aunt , and seeing no way of doing anything ; about coming down to have no money in my pocket , and to wear a shabby coat , and to be able to carry Dora no little presents , and to ride no gallant greys , and to show myself in no agreeable light ! Sordid and selfish as I knew it was , and as I tortured myself by knowing that it was , to let my mind run on my own distress so much , I was so devoted to Dora that I could not help it . I knew that it was base in me not to think more of my aunt , and less of myself ; but , so far , selfishness was inseparable from Dora , and I could not put Dora on one side for any mortal creature . How exceedingly miserable I was , that night ! As to sleep , I had dreams of poverty in all sorts of shapes , but I seemed to dream without the previous ceremony of going to sleep . Now I was ragged , wanting to sell Dora matches , six bundles for a halfpenny ; now I was at the office in a nightgown and boots , remonstrated with by Mr. Spenlow on appearing before the clients in that airy attire ; now I was hungrily picking up the crumbs that fell from old Tiffey ’s daily biscuit , regularly eaten when St. Paul ’s struck one ; now I was hopelessly endeavouring to get a licence to marry Dora , having nothing but one of Uriah Heep ’s gloves to offer in exchange , which the whole Commons rejected ; and still , more or less conscious of my own room , I was always tossing about like a distressed ship in a sea of bed - clothes . My aunt was restless , too , for I frequently heard her walking to and fro . Two or three times in the course of the night , attired in a long flannel wrapper in which she looked seven feet high , she appeared , like a disturbed ghost , in my room , and came to the side of the sofa on which I lay . On the first occasion I started up in alarm , to learn that she inferred from a particular light in the sky , that Westminster Abbey was on fire ; and to be consulted in reference to the probability of its igniting Buckingham Street , in case the wind changed . Lying still , after that , I found that she sat down near me , whispering to herself ‘
255201	255497	255198	255199	Poor boy	5264	’ And then it made me twenty times more wretched , to know how unselfishly mindful she was of me , and how selfishly mindful I was of myself . It was difficult to believe that a night so long to me , could be short to anybody else . This consideration set me thinking and thinking of an imaginary party where people were dancing the hours away , until that became a dream too , and I heard the music incessantly playing one tune , and saw Dora incessantly dancing one dance , without taking the least notice of me . The man who had been playing the harp all night , was trying in vain to cover it with an ordinary - sized nightcap , when I awoke ; or I should rather say , when I left off trying to go to sleep , and saw the sun shining in through the window at last . There was an old Roman bath in those days at the bottom of one of the streets out of the Strand -- it may be there still -- in which I have had many a cold plunge . Dressing myself as quietly as I could , and leaving Peggotty to look after my aunt , I tumbled head foremost into it , and then went for a walk to Hampstead . I had a hope that this brisk treatment might freshen my wits a little ; and I think it did them good , for I soon came to the conclusion that the first step I ought to take was , to try if my articles could be cancelled and the premium recovered . I got some breakfast on the Heath , and walked back to Doctors ’
255522	255609	255198	255199	Poor boy	5264	’ heads , intent on this first effort to meet our altered circumstances . I arrived at the office so soon , after all , that I had half an hour ’s loitering about the Commons , before old Tiffey , who was always first , appeared with his key . Then I sat down in my shady corner , looking up at the sunlight on the opposite chimney - pots , and thinking about Dora ; until Mr. Spenlow came in , crisp and curly . ‘
255616	255620	255612	255612	you	5269	’ said he . ‘
255624	255625	255612	255612	you	5269	’ ‘

257652	257655	257657	257657	Agnes	375	‘ Yes , ’
257659	257716	257657	257657	Agnes	375	‘ They have some business here ; and I took advantage of their coming , to come too . You must not think my visit all friendly and disinterested , Trotwood , for -- I am afraid I may be cruelly prejudiced -- I do not like to let papa go away alone , with him . ’
257717	257731	257732	257732	Agnes	375	‘ Does he exercise the same influence over Mr. Wickfield still , Agnes ? ’
257737	257746	257748	257748	she	375	‘ There is such a change at home , ’
257750	257767	257748	257748	she	375	‘ that you would scarcely know the dear old house . They live with us now . ’
257768	257771	257773	257773	I.	5312	‘ They ? ’
257774	257788	257790	257790	Agnes	375	‘ Mr. Heep and his mother . He sleeps in your old room , ’
257798	257809	257790	257790	Agnes	375	‘ I wish I had the ordering of his dreams , ’
257812	257820	257811	257811	I.	5312	‘ He would n’t sleep there long . ’
257821	257829	257831	257831	Agnes	375	‘ I keep my own little room , ’
257833	257862	257831	257831	Agnes	375	‘ where I used to learn my lessons . How the time goes ! You remember ? The little panelled room that opens from the drawing - room ? ’
257863	257896	257906	257906	Agnes	375	‘ Remember , Agnes ? When I saw you , for the first time , coming out at the door , with your quaint little basket of keys hanging at your side ? ’
257897	257904	257906	257906	Agnes	375	‘ It is just the same , ’
257910	257926	257906	257906	Agnes	375	‘ I am glad you think of it so pleasantly . We were very happy . ’
257927	257933	257935	257935	I.	5313	‘ We were , indeed , ’
257936	257960	257962	257962	Agnes	375	‘ I keep that room to myself still ; but I can not always desert Mrs. Heep , you know . And so , ’
257966	258025	257962	257962	Agnes	375	‘ I feel obliged to bear her company , when I might prefer to be alone . But I have no other reason to complain of her . If she tires me , sometimes , by her praises of her son , it is only natural in a mother . He is a very good son to her . ’
258070	258081	258083	258083	Agnes	375	‘ The chief evil of their presence in the house , ’
258085	258178	258083	258083	Agnes	375	‘ is that I can not be as near papa as I could wish -- Uriah Heep being so much between us -- and can not watch over him , if that is not too bold a thing to say , as closely as I would . But if any fraud or treachery is practising against him , I hope that simple love and truth will be strong in the end . I hope that real love and truth are stronger in the end than any evil or misfortune in the world . ’
258381	258542	258375	258375	her	450	‘ British Judy’--meaning , it was supposed , the bulwark of our national liberties . My aunt , however , having had time to cool , while Peggotty was out showing Mr. Dick the soldiers at the Horse Guards -- and being , besides , greatly pleased to see Agnes -- rather plumed herself on the affair than otherwise , and received us with unimpaired good humour . When Agnes laid her bonnet on the table , and sat down beside her , I could not but think , looking on her mild eyes and her radiant forehead , how natural it seemed to have her there ; how trustfully , although she was so young and inexperienced , my aunt confided in her ; how strong she was , indeed , in simple love and truth . We began to talk about my aunt ’s losses , and I told them what I had tried to do that morning . ‘

258616	258645	258646	258647	Betsey Trotwood	228	’ I observed Agnes turn pale , as she looked very attentively at my aunt . My aunt , patting her cat , looked very attentively at Agnes . ‘
258649	258664	258646	258647	Betsey Trotwood	228	’ said my aunt , who had always kept her money matters to herself . ‘
258849	258854	258844	258844	she	228	’ said my aunt , ‘
258900	258909	258882	258882	she	228	’ explained my aunt , rubbing her nose ; ‘
258956	258961	258882	258882	she	228	’ said my aunt ; ‘
259034	259060	259061	259063	Dear Miss Trotwood	228	’ My aunt concluded this philosophical summary , by fixing her eyes with a kind of triumph on Agnes , whose colour was gradually returning . ‘
259071	259075	259061	259063	Dear Miss Trotwood	228	’ said Agnes . ‘
259084	259089	259076	259076	I	0	’ said my aunt . ‘
259145	259208	259244	259244	Betsey	228	’ Agnes had listened at first with suspended breath . Her colour still came and went , but she breathed more freely . I thought I knew why . I thought she had had some fear that her unhappy father might be in some way to blame for what had happened . My aunt took her hand in hers , and laughed . ‘
259213	259218	259244	259244	Betsey	228	’ repeated my aunt . ‘
259279	259298	259273	259273	I	0	’ ; and here my aunt shook her own at me , with an energy peculiar to herself . ‘
259342	259382	259273	259273	I	0	’ said my aunt ; with whom it was an idiosyncrasy , as it is with some horses , to stop very short when she appeared to be in a fair way of going on for a long while . ‘
259385	259394	259397	259397	Dick	363	’ said my aunt , after a rest , ‘

259526	259546	259525	259525	We	5341	’re not going to have any knockings on the head in THIS family , if you please , sir . ’
259580	259590	259592	259593	my aunt	731	‘ You come to the point , my dear , ’
259595	259687	259592	259593	my aunt	731	‘ They are not to be got rid of , for six months at least , unless they could be underlet , and that I do n’t believe . The last man died here . Five people out of six would die -- of course -- of that woman in nankeen with the flannel petticoat . I have a little ready money ; and I agree with you , the best thing we can do , is , to live the term out here , and get a bedroom hard by . ’
259750	259758	259760	259760	Agnes	375	‘ I have been thinking , Trotwood , ’
259764	259770	259760	259760	Agnes	375	‘ that if you had time-- ’
259771	259807	259809	259809	I	0	‘ I have a good deal of time , Agnes . I am always disengaged after four or five o’clock , and I have time early in the morning . In one way and another , ’

259849	259857	259859	259859	Agnes	375	‘ I know you would not mind , ’

259901	259904	259906	259906	Agnes	375	‘ Because , ’
259908	259961	259906	259906	Agnes	375	‘ Doctor Strong has acted on his intention of retiring , and has come to live in London ; and he asked papa , I know , if he could recommend him one . Do n’t you think he would rather have his favourite old pupil near him , than anybody else ? ’
259962	259966	259968	259968	I.	5353	‘ Dear Agnes ! ’
259969	259999	260000	260000	Agnes	375	‘ What should I do without you ! You are always my good angel . I told you so . I never think of you in any other light . ’
260363	260366	260360	260360	she	731	‘ peppered everything ’
260436	260440	260442	260442	Agnes	375	‘ I think , ’
260447	260460	260442	260442	Agnes	375	‘ it ’s papa . He promised me that he would come . ’
260743	260764	260737	260737	Agnes	375	‘ Papa ! Here is Miss Trotwood -- and Trotwood , whom you have not seen for a long while ! ’
260898	260903	260909	260909	he	372	‘ Well , Wickfield ! ’
260919	260984	260909	260909	he	372	‘ I have been telling your daughter how well I have been disposing of my money for myself , because I could n’t trust it to you , as you were growing rusty in business matters . We have been taking counsel together , and getting on very well , all things considered . Agnes is worth the whole firm , in my opinion . ’
260985	260994	260996	260997	Uriah Heep	373	‘ If I may umbly make the remark , ’
261003	261025	260996	260997	Uriah Heep	373	‘ I fully agree with Miss Betsey Trotwood , and should be only too appy if Miss Agnes was a partner . ’

261061	261105	261055	261055	you	373	’ In acknowledgement of this question , addressed to him with extraordinary curtness , Mr. Heep , uncomfortably clutching the blue bag he carried , replied that he was pretty well , he thanked my aunt , and hoped she was the same . ‘
261118	261122	261107	261107	you	979	’ pursued Uriah . ‘
261145	261159	261137	261138	Mister Copperfield	232	’ I believed that ; for he seemed to relish them very much . ‘
261200	261209	261186	261186	I	0	’ said Uriah , with a fawning jerk , ‘
261216	261259	261263	261263	you	979	’ Here he shook hands with me : not in the common way , but standing at a good distance from me , and lifting my hand up and down like a pump handle , that he was a little afraid of . ‘
261276	261280	261274	261274	Mister	5382	’ fawned Uriah . ‘
261320	261328	261329	261330	the beautiful	5387	’ he added , as an afterthought , ‘
261337	261369	261334	261335	Miss Agnes	375	’ He jerked himself about , after this compliment , in such an intolerable manner , that my aunt , who had sat looking straight at him , lost all patience . ‘
261375	261382	261334	261335	Miss Agnes	375	’ said my aunt , sternly , ‘
261395	261396	261393	261393	sir	979	’ ‘
261405	261409	261397	261397	I	0	’ returned Uriah ; ‘
261411	261414	261399	261399	your	5390	’m aware you ’re
261417	261418	261424	261424	sir	979	’ ‘
261426	261435	261424	261424	sir	979	’ said my aunt , anything but appeased . ‘
261452	261465	261424	261424	sir	979	’re an eel , sir , conduct yourself like one . If you ’re
261478	261487	261475	261476	Good God	245	’ said my aunt , with great indignation , ‘
261502	261565	261475	261476	Good God	245	’ Mr. Heep was rather abashed , as most people might have been , by this explosion ; which derived great additional force from the indignant manner in which my aunt afterwards moved in her chair , and shook her head as if she were making snaps or bounces at him . But he said to me aside in a meek voice : ‘
261682	261694	261695	261696	Uriah Heep	373	’ said Uriah , with a sickly smile at his partner . ‘
261698	261709	261695	261696	Uriah Heep	373	’ said Mr. Wickfield , in a monotonous forced way , ‘
261749	261750	261742	261742	Uriah	373	’ ‘
261759	261782	261742	261742	Uriah	373	’ said Uriah , drawing up one leg , at the risk of bringing down upon himself another visitation from my aunt , ‘
261810	261811	261812	261813	Uriah Heep	373	’ ‘
261821	261832	261812	261813	Uriah Heep	373	’ said Mr. Wickfield , in the same dull voice . ‘
261849	261902	261812	261813	Uriah Heep	373	’ The red fox made him say all this , I knew , to exhibit him to me in the light he had indicated on the night when he poisoned my rest . I saw the same ill - favoured smile upon his face again , and saw how he watched me . ‘
261910	261916	261908	261908	papa	2049	’ said Agnes , anxiously . ‘
261927	261949	261918	261918	you	2049	’ He would have looked to Uriah , I believe , before replying , if that worthy had not anticipated him . ‘
261955	261959	261953	261953	myself	0	’ said Uriah , ‘
262012	262556	262008	262010	Miss Betsey Trotwood	228	’ With those words , he retired , kissing his great hand , and leering at us like a mask . We sat there , talking about our pleasant old Canterbury days , an hour or two . Mr. Wickfield , left to Agnes , soon became more like his former self ; though there was a settled depression upon him , which he never shook off . For all that , he brightened ; and had an evident pleasure in hearing us recall the little incidents of our old life , many of which he remembered very well . He said it was like those times , to be alone with Agnes and me again ; and he wished to Heaven they had never changed . I am sure there was an influence in the placid face of Agnes , and in the very touch of her hand upon his arm , that did wonders for him . My aunt ( who was busy nearly all this while with Peggotty , in the inner room ) would not accompany us to the place where they were staying , but insisted on my going ; and I went . We dined together . After dinner , Agnes sat beside him , as of old , and poured out his wine . He took what she gave him , and no more -- like a child -- and we all three sat together at a window as the evening gathered in . When it was almost dark , he lay down on a sofa , Agnes pillowing his head and bending over him a little while ; and when she came back to the window , it was not so dark but I could see tears glittering in her eyes . I pray Heaven that I never may forget the dear girl in her love and truth , at that time of my life ; for if I should , I must be drawing near the end , and then I would desire to remember her best ! She filled my heart with such good resolutions , strengthened my weakness so , by her example , so directed -- I know not how , she was too modest and gentle to advise me in many words -- the wandering ardour and unsettled purpose within me , that all the little good I have done , and all the harm I have forborne , I solemnly believe I may refer to her . And how she spoke to me of Dora , sitting at the window in the dark ; listened to my praises of her ; praised again ; and round the little fairy - figure shed some glimpses of her own pure light , that made it yet more precious and more innocent to me ! Oh , Agnes , sister of my boyhood , if I had known then , what I knew long afterwards-- ! There was a beggar in the street , when I went down ; and as I turned my head towards the window , thinking of her calm seraphic eyes , he made me start by muttering , as if he were an echo of the morning : ‘
262563	263530	263535	263535	Copperfield	232	’ CHAPTER 36 . ENTHUSIASM I began the next day with another dive into the Roman bath , and then started for Highgate . I was not dispirited now . I was not afraid of the shabby coat , and had no yearnings after gallant greys . My whole manner of thinking of our late misfortune was changed . What I had to do , was , to show my aunt that her past goodness to me had not been thrown away on an insensible , ungrateful object . What I had to do , was , to turn the painful discipline of my younger days to account , by going to work with a resolute and steady heart . What I had to do , was , to take my woodman ’s axe in my hand , and clear my own way through the forest of difficulty , by cutting down the trees until I came to Dora . And I went on at a mighty rate , as if it could be done by walking . When I found myself on the familiar Highgate road , pursuing such a different errand from that old one of pleasure , with which it was associated , it seemed as if a complete change had come on my whole life . But that did not discourage me . With the new life , came new purpose , new intention . Great was the labour ; priceless the reward . Dora was the reward , and Dora must be won . I got into such a transport , that I felt quite sorry my coat was not a little shabby already . I wanted to be cutting at those trees in the forest of difficulty , under circumstances that should prove my strength . I had a good mind to ask an old man , in wire spectacles , who was breaking stones upon the road , to lend me his hammer for a little while , and let me begin to beat a path to Dora out of granite . I stimulated myself into such a heat , and got so out of breath , that I felt as if I had been earning I do n’t know how much . In this state , I went into a cottage that I saw was to let , and examined it narrowly,--for I felt it necessary to be practical . It would do for me and Dora admirably : with a little front garden for Jip to run about in , and bark at the tradespeople through the railings , and a capital room upstairs for my aunt . I came out again , hotter and faster than ever , and dashed up to Highgate , at such a rate that I was there an hour too early ; and , though I had not been , should have been obliged to stroll about to cool myself , before I was at all presentable . My first care , after putting myself under this necessary course of preparation , was to find the Doctor ’s house . It was not in that part of Highgate where Mrs. Steerforth lived , but quite on the opposite side of the little town . When I had made this discovery , I went back , in an attraction I could not resist , to a lane by Mrs. Steerforth ’s , and looked over the corner of the garden wall . His room was shut up close . The conservatory doors were standing open , and Rosa Dartle was walking , bareheaded , with a quick , impetuous step , up and down a gravel walk on one side of the lawn . She gave me the idea of some fierce thing , that was dragging the length of its chain to and fro upon a beaten track , and wearing its heart out . I came softly away from my place of observation , and avoiding that part of the neighbourhood , and wishing I had not gone near it , strolled about until it was ten o’clock . The church with the slender spire , that stands on the top of the hill now , was not there then to tell me the time . An old red - brick mansion , used as a school , was in its place ; and a fine old house it must have been to go to school at , as I recollect it . When I approached the Doctor ’s cottage -- a pretty old place , on which he seemed to have expended some money , if I might judge from the embellishments and repairs that had the look of being just completed -- I saw him walking in the garden at the side , gaiters and all , as if he had never left off walking since the days of my pupilage . He had his old companions about him , too ; for there were plenty of high trees in the neighbourhood , and two or three rooks were on the grass , looking after him , as if they had been written to about him by the Canterbury rooks , and were observing him closely in consequence . Knowing the utter hopelessness of attracting his attention from that distance , I made bold to open the gate , and walk after him , so as to meet him when he should turn round . When he did , and came towards me , he looked at me thoughtfully for a few moments , evidently without thinking about me at all ; and then his benevolent face expressed extraordinary pleasure , and he took me by both hands . ‘
263537	263542	263535	263535	Copperfield	232	’ said the Doctor , ‘
263580	263592	263578	263578	me	0	’ I hoped he was well , and Mrs. Strong too . ‘
263598	263603	263578	263578	me	0	’ said the Doctor ; ‘
263654	263655	263646	263646	you	232	’ ‘
263660	263661	263646	263646	you	232	’ ‘
263665	263670	263646	263646	you	232	’ said the Doctor . ‘
263682	263683	263675	263675	He	348	’ ‘
263691	263695	263689	263689	sir	979	’ I inquired . ‘
263699	263704	263689	263689	sir	979	’ said the Doctor . ‘
263729	263741	263726	263727	Mrs. Markleham	387	’ Forgotten the Old Soldier ! And in that short time ! ‘
263745	263750	263742	263743	Mrs. Markleham	387	’ said the Doctor , ‘
263786	263845	263850	263850	Copperfield	232	’ I knew enough of Mr. Jack Maldon to suspect from this account that it was a place where there was not much to do , and which was pretty well paid . The Doctor , walking up and down with his hand on my shoulder , and his kind face turned encouragingly to mine , went on : ‘
263944	263979	263894	263894	us	5415	’ I became very glowing again , and , expressing myself in a rhapsodical style , I am afraid , urged my request strongly ; reminding the Doctor that I had already a profession . ‘
263984	263989	263894	263894	us	5415	’ said the Doctor , ‘
264027	264028	264015	264018	my good young friend	5416	’ ‘

264281	264292	264279	264279	sir	979	’ I returned , answering in our old school manner . ‘
264298	264324	264279	264279	sir	979	’ said the Doctor , clapping me on the shoulder , and still keeping his hand there , as we still walked up and down . ‘

He told me that since his retirement from scholastic life , he had been advancing with it wonderfully ; and that nothing could suit him better than the proposed arrangements for morning and evening work , as it was his custom to walk about in the daytime with his considering cap on . His papers were in a little confusion , in consequence of Mr. Jack Maldon having lately proffered his occasional services as an amanuensis , and not being accustomed to that occupation ; but we should soon put right what was amiss , and go on swimmingly . Afterwards , when we were fairly at our work , I found Mr. Jack Maldon ’s efforts more troublesome to me than I had expected , as he had not confined himself to making numerous mistakes , but had sketched so many soldiers , and ladies ’

264959	264969	264971	264972	the Doctor	838	‘ Have you breakfasted this morning , Mr. Jack ? ’
264974	264983	264984	264984	he	348	‘ I hardly ever take breakfast , sir , ’
264998	265005	264984	264984	he	348	‘ I find it bores me . ’
265006	265013	265015	265016	the Doctor	838	‘ Is there any news today ? ’
265018	265025	265027	265028	Mr. Maldon	348	‘ Nothing at all , sir , ’
265030	265057	265027	265028	Mr. Maldon	348	‘ There ’s an account about the people being hungry and discontented down in the North , but they are always being hungry and discontented somewhere . ’
265075	265095	265068	265068	he	838	‘ Then there ’s no news at all ; and no news , they say , is good news . ’
265096	265112	265114	265115	Mr. Maldon	348	‘ There ’s a long statement in the papers , sir , about a murder , ’
265117	265132	265114	265115	Mr. Maldon	348	‘ But somebody is always being murdered , and I did n’t read it . ’

265270	265312	265263	265264	Mr. Maldon	348	‘ It ’s the last good night there will be , this season ; and there ’s a singer there , whom she really ought to hear . She is perfectly exquisite . Besides which , she is so charmingly ugly , ’
265338	265349	265317	265318	The Doctor	838	‘ You must go , Annie . You must go . ’
265350	265356	265357	265357	she	5448	‘ I would rather not , ’

265779	266276	265772	265772	I	0	’ Commons , of the night when I had seen it looking at him as he read . I was pretty busy now ; up at five in the morning , and home at nine or ten at night . But I had infinite satisfaction in being so closely engaged , and never walked slowly on any account , and felt enthusiastically that the more I tired myself , the more I was doing to deserve Dora . I had not revealed myself in my altered character to Dora yet , because she was coming to see Miss Mills in a few days , and I deferred all I had to tell her until then ; merely informing her in my letters ( all our communications were secretly forwarded through Miss Mills ) , that I had much to tell her . In the meantime , I put myself on a short allowance of bear ’s grease , wholly abandoned scented soap and lavender water , and sold off three waistcoats at a prodigious sacrifice , as being too luxurious for my stern career . Not satisfied with all these proceedings , but burning with impatience to do something more , I went to see Traddles , now lodging up behind the parapet of a house in Castle Street , Holborn . Mr. Dick , who had been with me to Highgate twice already , and had resumed his companionship with the Doctor , I took with me . I took Mr. Dick with me , because , acutely sensitive to my aunt ’s reverses , and sincerely believing that no galley - slave or convict worked as I did , he had begun to fret and worry himself out of spirits and appetite , as having nothing useful to do . In this condition , he felt more incapable of finishing the Memorial than ever ; and the harder he worked at it , the oftener that unlucky head of King Charles the First got into it . Seriously apprehending that his malady would increase , unless we put some innocent deception upon him and caused him to believe that he was useful , or unless we could put him in the way of being really useful ( which would be better ) , I made up my mind to try if Traddles could help us . Before we went , I wrote Traddles a full statement of all that had happened , and Traddles wrote me back a capital answer , expressive of his sympathy and friendship . We found him hard at work with his inkstand and papers , refreshed by the sight of the flower - pot stand and the little round table in a corner of the small apartment . He received us cordially , and made friends with Mr. Dick in a moment . Mr. Dick professed an absolute certainty of having seen him before , and we both said , ‘
266280	266482	266483	266483	I	0	’ The first subject on which I had to consult Traddles was this,--I had heard that many men distinguished in various pursuits had begun life by reporting the debates in Parliament . Traddles having mentioned newspapers to me , as one of his hopes , I had put the two things together , and told Traddles in my letter that I wished to know how I could qualify myself for this pursuit . Traddles now informed me , as the result of his inquiries , that the mere mechanical acquisition necessary , except in rare cases , for thorough excellence in it , that is to say , a perfect and entire command of the mystery of short - hand writing and reading , was about equal in difficulty to the mastery of six languages ; and that it might perhaps be attained , by dint of perseverance , in the course of a few years . Traddles reasonably supposed that this would settle the business ; but I , only feeling that here indeed were a few tall trees to be hewn down , immediately resolved to work my way on to Dora through this thicket , axe in hand . ‘
266495	266498	266499	266499	I	0	’ said I. ‘
266504	266526	266527	266527	I	0	’ Traddles looked astonished , as he well might ; but he had no notion as yet of my rapturous condition . ‘
266533	266537	266527	266527	I	0	’ said I , ‘
266589	266590	266584	266584	I	0	’ ‘
266594	266602	266584	266584	I	0	’ said Traddles , opening his eyes , ‘
266616	266648	266649	266649	You	0	’ I do n’t know how he should have had , for it was new enough to me . I passed that off , and brought Mr. Dick on the carpet . ‘
266652	266659	266649	266649	You	0	’ said Mr. Dick , wistfully , ‘
266680	266716	266670	266670	I	0	’ Poor fellow ! I have little doubt he would have preferred such an employment in his heart to all others . Traddles , who would not have smiled for the world , replied composedly : ‘
266734	266735	266727	266727	You	0	’ ‘
266738	266752	266727	266727	You	0	’ said I. And indeed he was . He wrote with extraordinary neatness . ‘

266777	266785	266771	266771	I	0	’ Mr. Dick looked doubtfully at me . ‘
266790	266804	266806	266806	him	979	’ I shook my head . Mr. Dick shook his , and sighed . ‘
266811	266856	266806	266806	him	979	’ said Mr. Dick . I explained to Traddles that there was a difficulty in keeping King Charles the First out of Mr. Dick ’s manuscripts ; Mr. Dick in the meanwhile looking very deferentially and seriously at Traddles , and sucking his thumb . ‘
266876	266884	266861	266861	you	0	’ said Traddles after a little consideration . ‘
266915	267325	267330	267330	Trotwood	228	’ This gave us new hope . Traddles and I laying our heads together apart , while Mr. Dick anxiously watched us from his chair , we concocted a scheme in virtue of which we got him to work next day , with triumphant success . On a table by the window in Buckingham Street , we set out the work Traddles procured for him -- which was to make , I forget how many copies of a legal document about some right of way -- and on another table we spread the last unfinished original of the great Memorial . Our instructions to Mr. Dick were that he should copy exactly what he had before him , without the least departure from the original ; and that when he felt it necessary to make the slightest allusion to King Charles the First , he should fly to the Memorial . We exhorted him to be resolute in this , and left my aunt to observe him . My aunt reported to us , afterwards , that , at first , he was like a man playing the kettle - drums , and constantly divided his attentions between the two ; but that , finding this confuse and fatigue him , and having his copy there , plainly before his eyes , he soon sat at it in an orderly business - like manner , and postponed the Memorial to a more convenient time . In a word , although we took great care that he should have no more to do than was good for him , and although he did not begin with the beginning of a week , he earned by the following Saturday night ten shillings and nine - pence ; and never , while I live , shall I forget his going about to all the shops in the neighbourhood to change this treasure into sixpences , or his bringing them to my aunt arranged in the form of a heart upon a waiter , with tears of joy and pride in his eyes . He was like one under the propitious influence of a charm , from the moment of his being usefully employed ; and if there were a happy man in the world , that Saturday night , it was the grateful creature who thought my aunt the most wonderful woman in existence , and me the most wonderful young man . ‘
267332	267345	267330	267330	Trotwood	228	’ said Mr. Dick , shaking hands with me in a corner . ‘
267354	267384	267352	267352	Sir	979	’ and he flourished his ten fingers in the air , as if they were ten banks . I hardly know which was the better pleased , Traddles or I. ‘
267388	267408	267352	267352	Sir	979	’ said Traddles , suddenly , taking a letter out of his pocket , and giving it to me , ‘
267418	267439	267410	267411	Mr. Micawber	341	’ The letter ( Mr. Micawber never missed any possible opportunity of writing a letter ) was addressed to me , ‘
267454	267458	267444	267445	T. Traddles	546	’ It ran thus:-- ‘
267463	267500	267461	267461	COPPERFIELD	232	‘ You may possibly not be unprepared to receive the intimation that something has turned up . I may have mentioned to you on a former occasion that I was in expectation of such an event . ‘

If , on the eve of such a departure , you will accompany our mutual friend , Mr. Thomas Traddles , to our present abode , and there reciprocate the wishes natural to the occasion , you will confer a Boon ‘

268036	268078	268033	268034	Mrs. Micawber	342	‘ of your friendly interest in all our affairs , I am well assured . My family may consider it banishment , if they please ; but I am a wife and mother , and I never will desert Mr. Micawber . ’
268092	268095	268097	268098	Mrs. Micawber	342	‘ That , ’
268100	268178	268180	268181	Mrs. Micawber	342	‘ that , at least , is my view , my dear Mr. Copperfield and Mr. Traddles , of the obligation which I took upon myself when I repeated the irrevocable words , “ I , Emma , take thee , Wilkins . ” I read the service over with a flat - candle on the previous night , and the conclusion I derived from it was , that I never could desert Mr. Micawber . And , ’
268183	268203	268180	268181	Mrs. Micawber	342	‘ though it is possible I may be mistaken in my view of the ceremony , I never will ! ’

268217	268233	268210	268211	Mr. Micawber	341	‘ I am not conscious that you are expected to do anything of the sort . ’
268234	268244	268246	268247	Mrs. Micawber	342	‘ I am aware , my dear Mr. Copperfield , ’
268249	268309	268311	268312	Mrs. Micawber	342	‘ that I am now about to cast my lot among strangers ; and I am also aware that the various members of my family , to whom Mr. Micawber has written in the most gentlemanly terms , announcing that fact , have not taken the least notice of Mr. Micawber ’s communication . Indeed I may be superstitious , ’
268314	268392	268311	268312	Mrs. Micawber	342	‘ but it appears to me that Mr. Micawber is destined never to receive any answers whatever to the great majority of the communications he writes . I may augur , from the silence of my family , that they object to the resolution I have taken ; but I should not allow myself to be swerved from the path of duty , Mr. Copperfield , even by my papa and mama , were they still living . ’
268406	268413	268415	268416	Mrs. Micawber	342	‘ It may be a sacrifice , ’
268418	268458	268415	268416	Mrs. Micawber	342	‘ to immure one’s - self in a Cathedral town ; but surely , Mr. Copperfield , if it is a sacrifice in me , it is much more a sacrifice in a man of Mr. Micawber ’s abilities . ’

268495	268544	268473	268474	Mr. Micawber	341	‘ To Canterbury . In fact , my dear Copperfield , I have entered into arrangements , by virtue of which I stand pledged and contracted to our friend Heep , to assist and serve him in the capacity of -- and to be -- his confidential clerk . ’
268557	268566	268567	268567	he	341	‘ I am bound to state to you , ’
268575	268643	268645	268646	Mr. Micawber	341	‘ that the business habits , and the prudent suggestions , of Mrs. Micawber , have in a great measure conduced to this result . The gauntlet , to which Mrs. Micawber referred upon a former occasion , being thrown down in the form of an advertisement , was taken up by my friend Heep , and led to a mutual recognition . Of my friend Heep , ’
268648	268731	268733	268734	Mr. Micawber	341	‘ who is a man of remarkable shrewdness , I desire to speak with all possible respect . My friend Heep has not fixed the positive remuneration at too high a figure , but he has made a great deal , in the way of extrication from the pressure of pecuniary difficulties , contingent on the value of my services ; and on the value of those services I pin my faith . Such address and intelligence as I chance to possess , ’
268746	268810	268733	268734	Mr. Micawber	341	‘ will be devoted to my friend Heep ’s service . I have already some acquaintance with the law -- as a defendant on civil process -- and I shall immediately apply myself to the Commentaries of one of the most eminent and remarkable of our English jurists . I believe it is unnecessary to add that I allude to Mr. justice Blackstone . ’
268962	268976	268978	268979	Mrs. Micawber	342	‘ What I particularly request Mr. Micawber to be careful of , is , ’
268981	269059	269061	269062	Mrs. Micawber	342	‘ that he does not , my dear Mr. Copperfield , in applying himself to this subordinate branch of the law , place it out of his power to rise , ultimately , to the top of the tree . I am convinced that Mr. Micawber , giving his mind to a profession so adapted to his fertile resources , and his flow of language , must distinguish himself . Now , for example , Mr. Traddles , ’
269069	269102	269061	269062	Mrs. Micawber	342	‘ a judge , or even say a Chancellor . Does an individual place himself beyond the pale of those preferments by entering on such an office as Mr. Micawber has accepted ? ’

269143	269197	269198	269199	Mr. Micawber	341	‘ no ! Your mistake in life is , that you do not look forward far enough . You are bound , in justice to your family , if not to yourself , to take in at a comprehensive glance the extremest point in the horizon to which your abilities may lead you . ’
269227	269240	269242	269242	Traddles	306	‘ Why , the plain state of the case , Mrs. Micawber , ’
269251	269261	269242	269242	Traddles	306	‘ I mean the real prosaic fact , you know-- ’
269262	269266	269268	269269	Mrs. Micawber	342	‘ Just so , ’
269271	269295	269268	269269	Mrs. Micawber	342	‘ my dear Mr. Traddles , I wish to be as prosaic and literal as possible on a subject of so much importance . ’

269358	269398	269356	269356	Traddles	306	‘ to do with that . Only a barrister is eligible for such preferments ; and Mr. Micawber could not be a barrister , without being entered at an inn of court as a student , for five years . ’

269515	269575	269512	269513	Mrs. Micawber	342	‘ as a female , necessarily ; but I have always been of opinion that Mr. Micawber possesses what I have heard my papa call , when I lived at home , the judicial mind ; and I hope Mr. Micawber is now entering on a field where that mind will develop itself , and take a commanding station . ’

269750	269797	269747	269748	Mr. Micawber	341	‘ He has a remarkable head - voice , and will commence as a chorister . Our residence at Canterbury , and our local connexion , will , no doubt , enable him to take advantage of any vacancy that may arise in the Cathedral corps . ’

270051	270135	270035	270036	Mr. Micawber	341	‘ the companion of my youth : if I may be allowed the expression -- and my esteemed friend Traddles : if I may be permitted to call him so -- will allow me , on the part of Mrs. Micawber , myself , and our offspring , to thank them in the warmest and most uncompromising terms for their good wishes . It may be expected that on the eve of a migration which will consign us to a perfectly new existence , ’
270149	270352	270136	270137	Mr. Micawber	341	‘ I should offer a few valedictory remarks to two such friends as I see before me . But all that I have to say in this way , I have said . Whatever station in society I may attain , through the medium of the learned profession of which I am about to become an unworthy member , I shall endeavour not to disgrace , and Mrs. Micawber will be safe to adorn . Under the temporary pressure of pecuniary liabilities , contracted with a view to their immediate liquidation , but remaining unliquidated through a combination of circumstances , I have been under the necessity of assuming a garb from which my natural instincts recoil -- I allude to spectacles -- and possessing myself of a cognomen , to which I can establish no legitimate pretensions . All I have to say on that score is , that the cloud has passed from the dreary scene , and the God of Day is once more high upon the mountain tops . On Monday next , on the arrival of the four o’clock afternoon coach at Canterbury , my foot will be on my native heath -- my name , Micawber ! ’
270382	270479	270375	270375	He	341	‘ One thing more I have to do , before this separation is complete , and that is to perform an act of justice . My friend Mr. Thomas Traddles has , on two several occasions , “ put his name ” , if I may use a common expression , to bills of exchange for my accommodation . On the first occasion Mr. Thomas Traddles was left -- let me say , in short , in the lurch . The fulfilment of the second has not yet arrived . The amount of the first obligation , ’
270488	270565	270481	270482	Mr. Micawber	341	‘ was , I believe , twenty - three , four , nine and a half , of the second , according to my entry of that transaction , eighteen , six , two . These sums , united , make a total , if my calculation is correct , amounting to forty - one , ten , eleven and a half . My friend Copperfield will perhaps do me the favour to check that total ? ’
270574	270580	270582	270583	Mr. Micawber	341	‘ To leave this metropolis , ’
270585	270693	270582	270583	Mr. Micawber	341	‘ and my friend Mr. Thomas Traddles , without acquitting myself of the pecuniary part of this obligation , would weigh upon my mind to an insupportable extent . I have , therefore , prepared for my friend Mr. Thomas Traddles , and I now hold in my hand , a document , which accomplishes the desired object . I beg to hand to my friend Mr. Thomas Traddles my I.O.U. for forty - one , ten , eleven and a half , and I am happy to recover my moral dignity , and to know that I can once more walk erect before my fellow man ! ’

273440	273481	273483	273483	I	0	‘ And if you would promise me to read a little -- a little Cookery Book that I would send you , it would be so excellent for both of us . For our path in life , my Dora , ’
273490	273534	273483	273483	I	0	‘ is stony and rugged now , and it rests with us to smooth it . We must fight our way onward . We must be brave . There are obstacles to be met , and we must meet , and crush them ! ’
273754	273760	273762	273763	Miss Mills	524	‘ Who has done this ? ’
273772	273849	273769	273769	I	0	‘ I , Miss Mills ! I have done it ! Behold the destroyer!’--or words to that effect -- and hid my face from the light , in the sofa cushion . At first Miss Mills thought it was a quarrel , and that we were verging on the Desert of Sahara ; but she soon found out how matters stood , for my dear affectionate little Dora , embracing her , began exclaiming that I was ‘
273853	274216	274217	274218	Mr. Copperfield	232	’ ; and then cried for me , and embraced me , and asked me would I let her give me all her money to keep , and then fell on Miss Mills ’s neck , sobbing as if her tender heart were broken . Miss Mills must have been born to be a blessing to us . She ascertained from me in a few words what it was all about , comforted Dora , and gradually convinced her that I was not a labourer -- from my manner of stating the case I believe Dora concluded that I was a navigator , and went balancing myself up and down a plank all day with a wheelbarrow -- and so brought us together in peace . When we were quite composed , and Dora had gone up - stairs to put some rose - water to her eyes , Miss Mills rang for tea . In the ensuing interval , I told Miss Mills that she was evermore my friend , and that my heart must cease to vibrate ere I could forget her sympathy . I then expounded to Miss Mills what I had endeavoured , so very unsuccessfully , to expound to Dora . Miss Mills replied , on general principles , that the Cottage of content was better than the Palace of cold splendour , and that where love was , all was . I said to Miss Mills that this was very true , and who should know it better than I , who loved Dora with a love that never mortal had experienced yet ? But on Miss Mills observing , with despondency , that it were well indeed for some hearts if this were so , I explained that I begged leave to restrict the observation to mortals of the masculine gender . I then put it to Miss Mills , to say whether she considered that there was or was not any practical merit in the suggestion I had been anxious to make , concerning the accounts , the housekeeping , and the Cookery Book ? Miss Mills , after some consideration , thus replied : ‘
274310	274703	274713	274713	you	5581	’ And Miss Mills shook her head . I was encouraged by this closing admission on the part of Miss Mills to ask her , whether , for Dora ’s sake , if she had any opportunity of luring her attention to such preparations for an earnest life , she would avail herself of it ? Miss Mills replied in the affirmative so readily , that I further asked her if she would take charge of the Cookery Book ; and , if she ever could insinuate it upon Dora ’s acceptance , without frightening her , undertake to do me that crowning service . Miss Mills accepted this trust , too ; but was not sanguine . And Dora returned , looking such a lovely little creature , that I really doubted whether she ought to be troubled with anything so ordinary . And she loved me so much , and was so captivating ( particularly when she made Jip stand on his hind legs for toast , and when she pretended to hold that nose of his against the hot teapot for punishment because he would n’t ) , that I felt like a sort of Monster who had got into a Fairy ’s bower , when I thought of having frightened her , and made her cry . After tea we had the guitar ; and Dora sang those same dear old French songs about the impossibility of ever on any account leaving off dancing , La ra la , La ra la , until I felt a much greater Monster than before . We had only one check to our pleasure , and that happened a little while before I took my leave , when , Miss Mills chancing to make some allusion to tomorrow morning , I unluckily let out that , being obliged to exert myself now , I got up at five o’clock . Whether Dora had any idea that I was a Private Watchman , I am unable to say ; but it made a great impression on her , and she neither played nor sang any more . It was still on her mind when I bade her adieu ; and she said to me , in her pretty coaxing way -- as if I were a doll , I used to think : ‘
274722	274723	274724	274724	My	0	’ ‘
274727	274731	274724	274724	My	0	’ said I , ‘
274738	274739	274732	274732	I	0	’ ‘
274746	274750	274753	274753	you	0	’ returned Dora . ‘
274755	274781	274753	274753	you	0	’ It was impossible to say to that sweet little surprised face , otherwise than lightly and playfully , that we must work to live . ‘
274787	274791	274753	274753	you	0	’ cried Dora . ‘
274800	274803	274798	274798	Dora	488	’ said I. ‘
274809	275105	274753	274753	you	0	’ said Dora . She seemed to think she had quite settled the question , and gave me such a triumphant little kiss , direct from her innocent heart , that I would hardly have put her out of conceit with her answer , for a fortune . Well ! I loved her , and I went on loving her , most absorbingly , entirely , and completely . But going on , too , working pretty hard , and busily keeping red - hot all the irons I now had in the fire , I would sit sometimes of a night , opposite my aunt , thinking how I had frightened Dora that time , and how I could best make my way with a guitar - case through the forest of difficulty , until I used to fancy that my head was turning quite grey . CHAPTER 38 . A DISSOLUTION OF PARTNERSHIP I did not allow my resolution , with respect to the Parliamentary Debates , to cool . It was one of the irons I began to heat immediately , and one of the irons I kept hot , and hammered at , with a perseverance I may honestly admire . I bought an approved scheme of the noble art and mystery of stenography ( which cost me ten and sixpence ) ; and plunged into a sea of perplexity that brought me , in a few weeks , to the confines of distraction . The changes that were rung upon dots , which in such a position meant such a thing , and in such another position something else , entirely different ; the wonderful vagaries that were played by circles ; the unaccountable consequences that resulted from marks like flies ’
275716	275719	275693	275694	My aunt	731	‘ Hear ! ’
275721	275724	275693	275694	My aunt	731	‘ No ! ’
275726	275729	275693	275694	My aunt	731	‘ Oh ! ’
275933	276139	276467	276467	her	5605	’ shops ! There was nothing for it , but to turn back and begin all over again . It was very hard , but I turned back , though with a heavy heart , and began laboriously and methodically to plod over the same tedious ground at a snail ’s pace ; stopping to examine minutely every speck in the way , on all sides , and making the most desperate efforts to know these elusive characters by sight wherever I met them . I was always punctual at the office ; at the Doctor ’s too : and I really did work , as the common expression is , like a cart - horse . One day , when I went to the Commons as usual , I found Mr. Spenlow in the doorway looking extremely grave , and talking to himself . As he was in the habit of complaining of pains in his head -- he had naturally a short throat , and I do seriously believe he over - starched himself -- I was at first alarmed by the idea that he was not quite right in that direction ; but he soon relieved my uneasiness . Instead of returning my ‘
276142	276404	276452	276452	her	5605	’ with his usual affability , he looked at me in a distant , ceremonious manner , and coldly requested me to accompany him to a certain coffee - house , which , in those days , had a door opening into the Commons , just within the little archway in St. Paul ’s Churchyard . I complied , in a very uncomfortable state , and with a warm shooting all over me , as if my apprehensions were breaking out into buds . When I allowed him to go on a little before , on account of the narrowness of the way , I observed that he carried his head with a lofty air that was particularly unpromising ; and my mind misgave me that he had found out about my darling Dora . If I had not guessed this , on the way to the coffee - house , I could hardly have failed to know what was the matter when I followed him into an upstairs room , and found Miss Murdstone there , supported by a background of sideboard , on which were several inverted tumblers sustaining lemons , and two of those extraordinary boxes , all corners and flutings , for sticking knives and forks in , which , happily for mankind , are now obsolete . Miss Murdstone gave me her chilly finger - nails , and sat severely rigid . Mr. Spenlow shut the door , motioned me to a chair , and stood on the hearth - rug in front of the fireplace . ‘
276413	276428	276410	276411	Mr. Copperfield	232	’ said Mr. Spenlow , what you have in your reticule , Miss Murdstone . ’
276491	276502	276504	276505	Mr. Spenlow	447	‘ I believe that is your writing , Mr. Copperfield ? ’
276526	276532	276523	276523	I	0	‘ It is , sir ! ’
276533	276540	276542	276543	Mr. Spenlow	447	‘ If I am not mistaken , ’
276568	276579	276580	276580	I	0	‘ those are also from your pen , Mr. Copperfield ? ’
276602	276610	276646	276647	Mr. Spenlow	447	‘ My ever dearest and own Dora , ’
276611	276617	276646	276647	Mr. Spenlow	447	‘ My best beloved angel , ’
276618	276625	276646	276647	Mr. Spenlow	447	‘ My blessed one for ever , ’
276638	276644	276646	276647	Mr. Spenlow	447	‘ No , thank you ! ’
276660	276679	276695	276695	herself	278	‘ I will not deprive you of them . Miss Murdstone , be so good as to proceed ! ’
276703	276758	276695	276695	herself	278	‘ I must confess to having entertained my suspicions of Miss Spenlow , in reference to David Copperfield , for some time . I observed Miss Spenlow and David Copperfield , when they first met ; and the impression made upon me then was not agreeable . The depravity of the human heart is such-- ’
276759	276767	276769	276770	Mr. Spenlow	447	‘ You will oblige me , ma’am , ’
276772	276779	276769	276770	Mr. Spenlow	447	‘ by confining yourself to facts . ’
276804	276890	276788	276788	her	278	‘ Since I am to confine myself to facts , I will state them as dryly as I can . Perhaps that will be considered an acceptable course of proceeding . I have already said , sir , that I have had my suspicions of Miss Spenlow , in reference to David Copperfield , for some time . I have frequently endeavoured to find decisive corroboration of those suspicions , but without effect . I have therefore forborne to mention them to Miss Spenlow ’s father ’
276914	276943	276788	276788	her	278	’ Mr. Spenlow seemed quite cowed by the gentlemanly sternness of Miss Murdstone ’s manner , and deprecated her severity with a conciliatory little wave of his hand . ‘
276962	276971	276788	276788	her	278	’ pursued Miss Murdstone in a disdainful voice , ‘
277012	277027	277008	277009	Miss Spenlow	486	’ Dear , tender little Dora , so unconscious of this Dragon ’s eye ! ‘
277030	277035	277036	277036	I	0	’ resumed Miss Murdstone , ‘

277251	277256	277247	277248	Miss Spenlow	486	’ said Miss Murdstone , ‘
277403	277433	277434	277434	You	0	’ Here she ceased ; and snapping her reticule again , and shutting her mouth , looked as if she might be broken , but could never be bent . ‘
277440	277449	277434	277434	You	0	’ said Mr. Spenlow , turning to me . ‘
277467	277585	277459	277459	you	0	’ The picture I had before me , of the beautiful little treasure of my heart , sobbing and crying all night -- of her being alone , frightened , and wretched , then -- of her having so piteously begged and prayed that stony - hearted woman to forgive her -- of her having vainly offered her those kisses , work - boxes , and trinkets -- of her being in such grievous distress , and all for me -- very much impaired the little dignity I had been able to muster . I am afraid I was in a tremulous state for a minute or so , though I did my best to disguise it . ‘
277595	277599	277589	277589	I	0	’ I returned , ‘

278023	278059	278020	278020	I	0	’ said Mr. Spenlow , more like Punch than I had ever seen him , as he energetically struck one hand upon the other -- I could not help noticing that even in my despair ; ‘
278073	278086	278088	278088	I	0	’ The otherwise immovable Miss Murdstone laughed contemptuously in one short syllable . ‘
278098	278117	278088	278088	I	0	’ I began again , substituting a new form of expression for what was so unpalatable to him , ‘

278196	278214	278215	278215	you	5631	’ interrupted Mr. Spenlow , nodding his head a great many times , and frowning very much , ‘
278307	278398	278402	278403	Mr. Copperfield	232	’ No . I could n’t think of agreeing to it . I was very sorry , but there was a higher consideration than sense . Love was above all earthly considerations , and I loved Dora to idolatry , and Dora loved me . I did n’t exactly say so ; I softened it down as much as I could ; but I implied it , and I was resolute upon it . I do n’t think I made myself very ridiculous , but I know I was resolute . ‘
278405	278410	278402	278403	Mr. Copperfield	232	’ said Mr. Spenlow , ‘
278420	278462	278463	278463	I	0	’ Miss Murdstone , by an expressive sound , a long drawn respiration , which was neither a sigh nor a moan , but was like both , gave it as her opinion that he should have done this at first . ‘
278467	278477	278478	278478	my	0	’ said Mr. Spenlow , confirmed by this support , ‘
278495	278530	278485	278485	you	232	’ For I had laid them on the table . Yes . I told him I hoped he would not think it wrong , but I could n’t possibly take them from Miss Murdstone . ‘
278535	278553	278485	278485	you	232	’ said Mr. Spenlow . No , I replied with the profoundest respect ; nor from him . ‘
278557	278643	278644	278644	You	0	’ said Mr. Spenlow . A silence succeeding , I was undecided whether to go or stay . At length I was moving quietly towards the door , with the intention of saying that perhaps I should consult his feelings best by withdrawing : when he said , with his hands in his coat pockets , into which it was as much as he could do to get them ; and with what I should call , upon the whole , a decidedly pious air : ‘
278673	278713	278714	278714	I	0	’ I hurriedly made him a reply to the effect , that I hoped the error into which I had been betrayed by the desperate nature of my love , did not induce him to think me mercenary too ? ‘
278725	278730	278714	278714	I	0	’ said Mr. Spenlow . ‘
278793	278799	278779	278779	you	0	’ I certainly supposed so . ‘

278871	278879	278880	278880	I	0	’ I inclined my head in acquiescence . ‘
278885	278914	278959	278959	I	0	’ said Mr. Spenlow , with an evident increase of pious sentiment , and slowly shaking his head as he poised himself upon his toes and heels alternately , ‘
279055	279197	279010	279010	you	232	’ There was a serenity , a tranquillity , a calm sunset air about him , which quite affected me . He was so peaceful and resigned -- clearly had his affairs in such perfect train , and so systematically wound up -- that he was a man to feel touched in the contemplation of . I really think I saw tears rise to his eyes , from the depth of his own feeling of all this . But what could I do ? I could not deny Dora and my own heart . When he told me I had better take a week to consider of what he had said , how could I say I would n’t take a week , yet how could I fail to know that no amount of weeks could influence such love as mine ? ‘
279217	279229	279010	279010	you	232	’ said Mr. Spenlow , adjusting his cravat with both hands . ‘
279237	279683	279234	279235	Mr. Copperfield	232	’ I submitted ; and , with a countenance as expressive as I was able to make it of dejected and despairing constancy , came out of the room . Miss Murdstone ’s heavy eyebrows followed me to the door -- I say her eyebrows rather than her eyes , because they were much more important in her face -- and she looked so exactly as she used to look , at about that hour of the morning , in our parlour at Blunderstone , that I could have fancied I had been breaking down in my lessons again , and that the dead weight on my mind was that horrible old spelling - book , with oval woodcuts , shaped , to my youthful fancy , like the glasses out of spectacles . When I got to the office , and , shutting out old Tiffey and the rest of them with my hands , sat at my desk , in my own particular nook , thinking of this earthquake that had taken place so unexpectedly , and in the bitterness of my spirit cursing Jip , I fell into such a state of torment about Dora , that I wonder I did not take up my hat and rush insanely to Norwood . The idea of their frightening her , and making her cry , and of my not being there to comfort her , was so excruciating , that it impelled me to write a wild letter to Mr. Spenlow , beseeching him not to visit upon her the consequences of my awful destiny . I implored him to spare her gentle nature -- not to crush a fragile flower -- and addressed him generally , to the best of my remembrance , as if , instead of being her father , he had been an Ogre , or the Dragon of Wantley . This letter I sealed and laid upon his desk before he returned ; and when he came in , I saw him , through the half - opened door of his room , take it up and read it . He said nothing about it all the morning ; but before he went away in the afternoon he called me in , and told me that I need not make myself at all uneasy about his daughter ’s happiness . He had assured her , he said , that it was all nonsense ; and he had nothing more to say to her . He believed he was an indulgent father ( as indeed he was ) , and I might spare myself any solicitude on her account . ‘
279700	279704	279234	279235	Mr. Copperfield	232	’ he observed , ‘
279746	279757	279743	279744	Miss Murdstone	278	’ for I had alluded to her in the letter , ‘
279811	280101	279772	279772	she	784	’ All ! In the note I wrote to Miss Mills , I bitterly quoted this sentiment . All I had to do , I said , with gloomy sarcasm , was to forget Dora . That was all , and what was that ! I entreated Miss Mills to see me , that evening . If it could not be done with Mr. Mills ’s sanction and concurrence , I besought a clandestine interview in the back kitchen where the Mangle was . I informed her that my reason was tottering on its throne , and only she , Miss Mills , could prevent its being deposed . I signed myself , hers distractedly ; and I could n’t help feeling , while I read this composition over , before sending it by a porter , that it was something in the style of Mr. Micawber . However , I sent it . At night I repaired to Miss Mills ’s street , and walked up and down , until I was stealthily fetched in by Miss Mills ’s maid , and taken the area way to the back kitchen . I have since seen reason to believe that there was nothing on earth to prevent my going in at the front door , and being shown up into the drawing - room , except Miss Mills ’s love of the romantic and mysterious . In the back kitchen , I raved as became me . I went there , I suppose , to make a fool of myself , and I am quite sure I did it . Miss Mills had received a hasty note from Dora , telling her that all was discovered , and saying . ‘
280114	280515	280108	280108	Julia	525	’ But Miss Mills , mistrusting the acceptability of her presence to the higher powers , had not yet gone ; and we were all benighted in the Desert of Sahara . Miss Mills had a wonderful flow of words , and liked to pour them out . I could not help feeling , though she mingled her tears with mine , that she had a dreadful luxury in our afflictions . She petted them , as I may say , and made the most of them . A deep gulf , she observed , had opened between Dora and me , and Love could only span it with its rainbow . Love must suffer in this stern world ; it ever had been so , it ever would be so . No matter , Miss Mills remarked . Hearts confined by cobwebs would burst at last , and then Love was avenged . This was small consolation , but Miss Mills would n’t encourage fallacious hopes . She made me much more wretched than I was before , and I felt ( and told her with the deepest gratitude ) that she was indeed a friend . We resolved that she should go to Dora the first thing in the morning , and find some means of assuring her , either by looks or words , of my devotion and misery . We parted , overwhelmed with grief ; and I think Miss Mills enjoyed herself completely . I confided all to my aunt when I got home ; and in spite of all she could say to me , went to bed despairing . I got up despairing , and went out despairing . It was Saturday morning , and I went straight to the Commons . I was surprised , when I came within sight of our office - door , to see the ticket - porters standing outside talking together , and some half - dozen stragglers gazing at the windows which were shut up . I quickened my pace , and , passing among them , wondering at their looks , went hurriedly in . The clerks were there , but nobody was doing anything . Old Tiffey , for the first time in his life I should think , was sitting on somebody else ’s stool , and had not hung up his hat . ‘
280525	280533	280522	280523	Mr. Copperfield	232	’ said he , as I entered . ‘
280537	280541	280108	280108	Julia	525	’ I exclaimed . ‘

280554	280569	280551	280551	you	232	’ cried Tiffey , and all the rest of them , coming round me . ‘
280572	280582	280583	280584	Mr. Spenlow	447	’ said I , looking from face to face . ‘
280586	280590	280583	280584	Mr. Spenlow	447	’ said Tiffey . ‘

280599	280652	280593	280593	him	447	’ I thought it was the office reeling , and not I , as one of the clerks caught hold of me . They sat me down in a chair , untied my neck - cloth , and brought me some water . I have no idea whether this took any time . ‘

Whether he fell out in a fit , or got out , feeling ill before the fit came on -- or even whether he was quite dead then , though there is no doubt he was quite insensible -- no one appears to know . If he breathed , certainly he never spoke . Medical assistance was got as soon as possible , but it was quite useless . ’

Some time ago , before her father ’s death , when I thought it right to mention to her -- but I ’ll tell you , if you will bear with me , how it was . ’

I would relate , as plainly and as openly as possible , all that has taken place ; and I would ask their permission to visit sometimes , at their house . Considering that you are young , and striving for a place in life , I think it would be well to say that you would readily abide by any conditions they might impose upon you . I would entreat them not to dismiss your request , without a reference to Dora ; and to discuss it with her when they should think the time suitable . I would not be too vehement , ’
287143	287162	287139	287139	Agnes	375	‘ or propose too much . I would trust to my fidelity and perseverance -- and to Dora . ’

I had hoped to have no other companion than Agnes . But Mrs. Heep had asked permission to bring herself and her knitting near the fire , in that room ; on pretence of its having an aspect more favourable for her rheumatics , as the wind then was , than the drawing - room or dining - parlour . Though I could almost have consigned her to the mercies of the wind on the topmost pinnacle of the Cathedral , without remorse , I made a virtue of necessity , and gave her a friendly salutation . ‘

288022	288027	288019	288020	Miss Wickfield	567	’ inquired Mrs. Heep . ‘
288030	288044	288019	288020	Miss Wickfield	567	’ said Agnes , quietly pursuing the work on which she was engaged . ‘
288057	288701	288052	288052	He	11041	’ Mrs. Heep , with a prodigious sniff , resumed her knitting . She never left off , or left us for a moment . I had arrived early in the day , and we had still three or four hours before dinner ; but she sat there , plying her knitting - needles as monotonously as an hour - glass might have poured out its sands . She sat on one side of the fire ; I sat at the desk in front of it ; a little beyond me , on the other side , sat Agnes . Whensoever , slowly pondering over my letter , I lifted up my eyes , and meeting the thoughtful face of Agnes , saw it clear , and beam encouragement upon me , with its own angelic expression , I was conscious presently of the evil eye passing me , and going on to her , and coming back to me again , and dropping furtively upon the knitting . What the knitting was , I do n’t know , not being learned in that art ; but it looked like a net ; and as she worked away with those Chinese chopsticks of knitting - needles , she showed in the firelight like an ill - looking enchantress , baulked as yet by the radiant goodness opposite , but getting ready for a cast of her net by and by . At dinner she maintained her watch , with the same unwinking eyes . After dinner , her son took his turn ; and when Mr. Wickfield , himself , and I were left alone together , leered at me , and writhed until I could hardly bear it . In the drawing - room , there was the mother knitting and watching again . All the time that Agnes sang and played , the mother sat at the piano . Once she asked for a particular ballad , which she said her Ury ( who was yawning in a great chair ) doted on ; and at intervals she looked round at him , and reported to Agnes that he was in raptures with the music . But she hardly ever spoke -- I question if she ever did -- without making some mention of him . It was evident to me that this was the duty assigned to her . This lasted until bedtime . To have seen the mother and son , like two great bats hanging over the whole house , and darkening it with their ugly forms , made me so uncomfortable , that I would rather have remained downstairs , knitting and all , than gone to bed . I hardly got any sleep . Next day the knitting and watching began again , and lasted all day . I had not an opportunity of speaking to Agnes , for ten minutes . I could barely show her my letter . I proposed to her to walk out with me ; but Mrs. Heep repeatedly complaining that she was worse , Agnes charitably remained within , to bear her company . Towards the twilight I went out by myself , musing on what I ought to do , and whether I was justified in withholding from Agnes , any longer , what Uriah Heep had told me in London ; for that began to trouble me again , very much . I had not walked out far enough to be quite clear of the town , upon the Ramsgate road , where there was a good path , when I was hailed , through the dust , by somebody behind me . The shambling figure , and the scanty great - coat , were not to be mistaken . I stopped , and Uriah Heep came up . ‘
288704	288707	288052	288052	He	11041	’ said I. ‘

Father and me was both brought up at a foundation school for boys ; and mother , she was likewise brought up at a public , sort of charitable , establishment . They taught us all a deal of umbleness -- not much else that I know of , from morning to night . We was to be umble to this person , and umble to that ; and to pull off our caps here , and to make bows there ; and always to know our place , and abase ourselves before our betters . And we had such a lot of betters ! Father got the monitor - medal by being umble . So did I. Father got made a sexton by being umble . He had the character , among the gentlefolks , of being such a well - behaved man , that they were determined to bring him in . “ Be umble , Uriah , ” says father to me , “ and you ’ll get on . It was what was always being dinned into you and me at school ; it ’s what goes down best . Be umble , ” says father , “ and you ’ll do ! ” And really it ai n’t done bad ! ’

When I saw him in the light , I observed , not only that his hair was long and ragged , but that his face was burnt dark by the sun . He was greyer , the lines in his face and forehead were deeper , and he had every appearance of having toiled and wandered through all varieties of weather ; but he looked very strong , and like a man upheld by steadfastness of purpose , whom nothing could tire out . He shook the snow from his hat and clothes , and brushed it away from his face , while I was inwardly making these remarks . As he sat down opposite to me at a table , with his back to the door by which we had entered , he put out his rough hand again , and grasped mine warmly . ‘

So , here was another earthquake of which I became the sport , before I had recovered from the shock of its predecessor ! I was in several minds how to dress myself on the important day ; being divided between my desire to appear to advantage , and my apprehensions of putting on anything that might impair my severely practical character in the eyes of the Misses Spenlow . I endeavoured to hit a happy medium between these two extremes ; my aunt approved the result ; and Mr. Dick threw one of his shoes after Traddles and me , for luck , as we went downstairs . Excellent fellow as I knew Traddles to be , and warmly attached to him as I was , I could not help wishing , on that delicate occasion , that he had never contracted the habit of brushing his hair so very upright . It gave him a surprised look -- not to say a hearth - broomy kind of expression -- which , my apprehensions whispered , might be fatal to us . I took the liberty of mentioning it to Traddles , as we were walking to Putney ; and saying that if he WOULD smooth it down a little-- ‘

298625	298626	298628	298628	she	6016	’ ‘
298633	298634	298628	298628	she	6016	’ ‘
298639	298643	298635	298635	SHE	6016	’ rejoined Traddles ; ‘
298675	298676	298668	298670	all the sisters	6019	’ ‘
298679	298682	298668	298670	all the sisters	6019	’ said I. ‘
298685	298692	298700	298700	They	6019	’ returned Traddles with perfect innocence , ‘
298734	298735	298729	298729	We	6020	’ ‘
298744	298748	298729	298729	We	6020	’ said I , ‘
298796	298802	298833	298833	You	6024	’ I added , nervously . ‘
298805	298819	298833	298833	You	6024	’ replied Traddles , on whose attentive face a thoughtful shade had stolen , ‘
298898	298899	298900	298901	The mama	6028	’ ‘
298903	298906	298907	298908	The mama	6028	’ said I. ‘
298910	298954	298907	298908	The mama	6028	’ said Traddles--‘Reverend Horace Crewler -- when I mentioned it with every possible precaution to Mrs. Crewler , the effect upon her was such that she gave a scream and became insensible . I could n’t approach the subject again , for months . ’
298955	298961	298963	298963	I.	6030	‘ You did at last ? ’
298964	298972	298974	298974	Traddles	306	‘ Well , the Reverend Horace did , ’
298976	299050	298974	298974	Traddles	306	‘ He is an excellent man , most exemplary in every way ; and he pointed out to her that she ought , as a Christian , to reconcile herself to the sacrifice ( especially as it was so uncertain ) , and to bear no uncharitable feeling towards me . As to myself , Copperfield , I give you my word , I felt a perfect bird of prey towards the family . ’
299051	299063	298907	298908	The mama	6028	‘ The sisters took your part , I hope , Traddles ? ’
299064	299074	299075	299075	he	6031	‘ Why , I ca n’t say they did , ’
299078	299115	299075	299075	he	6031	‘ When we had comparatively reconciled Mrs. Crewler to it , we had to break it to Sarah . You recollect my mentioning Sarah , as the one that has something the matter with her spine ? ’
299116	299119	299129	299129	Traddles	306	‘ Perfectly ! ’
299120	299127	299129	299129	Traddles	306	‘ She clenched both her hands , ’
299137	299171	299129	299129	Traddles	306	‘ shut her eyes ; turned lead - colour ; became perfectly stiff ; and took nothing for two days but toast - and - water , administered with a tea - spoon . ’
299172	299181	299182	299182	I	0	‘ What a very unpleasant girl , Traddles ! ’
299185	299195	299197	299197	Traddles	306	‘ Oh , I beg your pardon , Copperfield ! ’
299199	299318	299197	299197	Traddles	306	‘ She is a very charming girl , but she has a great deal of feeling . In fact , they all have . Sophy told me afterwards , that the self - reproach she underwent while she was in attendance upon Sarah , no words could describe . I know it must have been severe , by my own feelings , Copperfield ; which were like a criminal ’s . After Sarah was restored , we still had to break it to the other eight ; and it produced various effects upon them of a most pathetic nature . The two little ones , whom Sophy educates , have only just left off de - testing me . ’
299319	299335	299337	299337	I.	6032	‘ At any rate , they are all reconciled to it now , I hope ? ’
299338	299357	299359	299359	Traddles	534	‘ Ye - yes , I should say they were , on the whole , resigned to it , ’
299363	299424	299359	299359	Traddles	534	‘ The fact is , we avoid mentioning the subject ; and my unsettled prospects and indifferent circumstances are a great consolation to them . There will be a deplorable scene , whenever we are married . It will be much more like a funeral , than a wedding . And they ’ll all hate me for taking her away ! ’
299772	299775	299777	299782	one of the two little ladies	6045	‘ Pray , ’
299784	299788	299777	299782	one of the two little ladies	6045	‘ be seated . ’
299990	299997	300008	300008	herself	6056	‘ Mr. Copperfield , I believe , ’
300081	300085	300087	300091	the sister with the letter	6058	‘ Mr. Copperfield ! ’
300114	300119	300121	300121	she	6059	‘ My sister Lavinia , ’
300122	300146	300121	300121	she	6059	‘ being conversant with matters of this nature , will state what we consider most calculated to promote the happiness of both parties . ’
300331	300336	300338	300339	Miss Lavinia	583	‘ We will not , ’
300341	300361	300338	300339	Miss Lavinia	583	‘ enter on the past history of this matter . Our poor brother Francis ’s death has cancelled that . ’
300362	300367	300369	300370	Miss Clarissa	274	‘ We had not , ’
300372	300426	300369	300370	Miss Clarissa	274	‘ been in the habit of frequent association with our brother Francis ; but there was no decided division or disunion between us . Francis took his road ; we took ours . We considered it conducive to the happiness of all parties that it should be so . And it was so . ’
300480	300500	300502	300503	Miss Lavinia	583	‘ Our niece ’s position , or supposed position , is much changed by our brother Francis ’s death , ’
300505	300568	300502	300503	Miss Lavinia	583	‘ and therefore we consider our brother ’s opinions as regarded her position as being changed too . We have no reason to doubt , Mr. Copperfield , that you are a young gentleman possessed of good qualities and honourable character ; or that you have an affection -- or are fully persuaded that you have an affection -- for our niece . ’
300638	300644	300645	300645	she	274	‘ If Dora ’s mama , ’
300648	300686	300645	300645	she	274	‘ when she married our brother Francis , had at once said that there was not room for the family at the dinner - table , it would have been better for the happiness of all parties . ’
300687	300691	300693	300694	Miss Lavinia	583	‘ Sister Clarissa , ’
300696	300705	300693	300694	Miss Lavinia	583	‘ Perhaps we need n’t mind that now . ’
300706	300710	300712	300713	Miss Clarissa	274	‘ Sister Lavinia , ’
300715	300828	300712	300713	Miss Clarissa	274	‘ it belongs to the subject . With your branch of the subject , on which alone you are competent to speak , I should not think of interfering . On this branch of the subject I have a voice and an opinion . It would have been better for the happiness of all parties , if Dora ’s mama , when she married our brother Francis , had mentioned plainly what her intentions were . We should then have known what we had to expect . We should have said “ Pray do not invite us , at any time ” ; and all possibility of misunderstanding would have been avoided . ’
300869	300913	300914	300914	You	0	’ eyes . They were not unlike birds , altogether ; having a sharp , brisk , sudden manner , and a little short , spruce way of adjusting themselves , like canaries . Miss Lavinia , as I have said , resumed : ‘
300939	300940	300924	300925	Mr. Copperfield	232	’ ‘
300946	300966	300924	300925	Mr. Copperfield	232	’ said Miss Clarissa , breaking out again , if I may call anything so calm a breaking out , ‘
300976	300982	300975	300977	Doctors ’ Commons	11753	’ Commons , and of Doctors ’
301051	301104	301048	301048	I	0	’ As this appeared to be addressed to Traddles and me , both Traddles and I made some sort of reply . Traddles was inaudible . I think I observed , myself , that it was highly creditable to all concerned . I do n’t in the least know what I meant . ‘
301108	301119	301105	301106	Sister Lavinia	587	’ said Miss Clarissa , having now relieved her mind , ‘
301128	301133	301120	301120	you	587	’ Miss Lavinia proceeded : ‘
301186	301187	301190	301190	ma’am	8495	’ ‘
301192	301197	301190	301190	ma’am	8495	’ I rapturously began , ‘
301199	301229	301190	301190	ma’am	8495	’ But Miss Clarissa giving me a look ( just like a sharp canary ) , as requesting that I would not interrupt the oracle , I begged pardon . ‘
301232	301258	301190	301190	ma’am	8495	’ said Miss Lavinia , glancing at her sister for corroboration , which she gave in the form of a little nod to every clause , ‘
301313	301359	301272	301272	Its	6084	’ Of course I did not understand then that this was an allusion to her supposed experience of the stricken Pidger ; but I saw , from the gravity with which Miss Clarissa nodded her head , that great weight was attached to these words . ‘
301383	301388	301272	301272	Its	6084	’ pursued Miss Lavinia , ‘
301435	301436	301434	301434	Mr.--	588	’ ‘
301439	301449	301434	301434	Mr.--	588	’ said my friend , finding himself looked at . ‘
301462	301475	301459	301459	I	0	’ said Miss Clarissa , again glancing at my letter . Traddles said ‘
301479	301729	301730	301730	I	0	’ and became pretty red in the face . Now , although I had not received any express encouragement as yet , I fancied that I saw in the two little sisters , and particularly in Miss Lavinia , an intensified enjoyment of this new and fruitful subject of domestic interest , a settling down to make the most of it , a disposition to pet it , in which there was a good bright ray of hope . I thought I perceived that Miss Lavinia would have uncommon satisfaction in superintending two young lovers , like Dora and me ; and that Miss Clarissa would have hardly less satisfaction in seeing her superintend us , and in chiming in with her own particular department of the subject whenever that impulse was strong upon her . This gave me courage to protest most vehemently that I loved Dora better than I could tell , or anyone believe ; that all my friends knew how I loved her ; that my aunt , Agnes , Traddles , everyone who knew me , knew how I loved her , and how earnest my love had made me . For the truth of this , I appealed to Traddles . And Traddles , firing up as if he were plunging into a Parliamentary Debate , really did come out nobly : confirming me in good round terms , and in a plain sensible practical manner , that evidently made a favourable impression . ‘
301752	301756	301802	301803	Mr. Traddles	306	’ said Traddles , ‘
301789	301790	301791	301791	You	0	’ ‘
301805	301818	301798	301798	I	0	’ observed Miss Lavinia , evidently taking a new interest in him , ‘
301833	301834	301798	301798	I	0	’ ‘
301839	301870	301798	301798	I	0	’ said Traddles . Miss Clarissa looked at Miss Lavinia , and shook her head gravely . Miss Lavinia looked consciously at Miss Clarissa , and heaved a little sigh . ‘
301874	301879	301871	301872	Sister Lavinia	587	’ said Miss Clarissa , ‘
301886	301920	301921	301921	My	0	’ Miss Lavinia revived herself with a few whiffs of aromatic vinegar -- Traddles and I looking on with great solicitude the while ; and then went on to say , rather faintly : ‘
301964	301965	301958	301959	Mr. Copperfield	232	’ ‘
301972	301977	301958	301959	Mr. Copperfield	232	’ remarked Miss Clarissa . ‘
302035	302073	302030	302031	Sister Lavinia	587	’ Miss Lavinia turned my letter , so as to bring the superscription towards herself , and referred through her eye - glass to some orderly - looking notes she had made on that part of it . ‘
302079	302083	302030	302031	Sister Lavinia	587	’ said she , ‘
302147	302148	302149	302149	I	0	’ ‘
302156	302168	302248	302249	Miss Lavinia	583	’ I exclaimed , relieved of an immense load of apprehension , ‘
302173	302174	302248	302249	Miss Lavinia	583	’ ‘
302177	302224	302248	302249	Miss Lavinia	583	’ pursued Miss Lavinia,--‘but , we would prefer to regard those visits , Mr. Traddles , as made , at present , to us . We must guard ourselves from recognizing any positive engagement between Mr. Copperfield and our niece , until we have had an opportunity-- ’
302225	302236	302238	302239	Miss Clarissa	274	‘ Until YOU have had an opportunity , sister Lavinia , ’
302241	302246	302238	302239	Miss Clarissa	274	‘ Be it so , ’
302263	302264	302265	302265	Copperfield	232	’ ‘
302267	302275	302238	302239	Miss Clarissa	274	’ said Traddles , turning to me , ‘
302292	302293	302279	302279	I	0	’ ‘
302296	302299	302300	302300	I	0	’ cried I. ‘

302315	302326	302329	302329	his	232	’ said Miss Lavinia , again referring to her notes , ‘

302397	302402	302388	302388	us--	6107	’ Miss Clarissa interposed . ‘
302409	302453	302458	302458	her	583	’ assented Miss Lavinia resignedly--‘to me -- and receiving our concurrence . We must make this a most express and serious stipulation , not to be broken on any account . We wished Mr. Copperfield to be accompanied by some confidential friend today , ’
302466	302512	302513	302513	I	0	‘ in order that there might be no doubt or misconception on this subject . If Mr. Copperfield , or if you , Mr. Traddles , feel the least scruple , in giving this promise , I beg you to take time to consider it . ’
302575	302578	302580	302581	Miss Lavinia	583	‘ Stay ! ’
302588	302626	302580	302581	Miss Lavinia	583	‘ we resolved , before we had the pleasure of receiving you two gentlemen , to leave you alone for a quarter of an hour , to consider this point . You will allow us to retire . ’

302753	302760	302750	302751	Miss Lavinia	583	‘ the rest is with you . ’
302780	302786	302788	302789	Miss Clarissa	274	‘ We shall be happy , ’
302791	302814	302788	302789	Miss Clarissa	274	‘ to see Mr. Copperfield to dinner , every Sunday , if it should suit his convenience . Our hour is three . ’
302818	302826	302828	302829	Miss Clarissa	274	‘ In the course of the week , ’
302831	302851	302828	302829	Miss Clarissa	274	‘ we shall be happy to see Mr. Copperfield to tea . Our hour is half - past six . ’
302856	302862	302864	302865	Miss Clarissa	274	‘ Twice in the week , ’
302867	302877	302878	302878	I	0	‘ but , as a rule , not oftener . ’
302882	302886	302888	302889	Miss Clarissa	274	‘ Miss Trotwood , ’
302891	302963	302888	302889	Miss Clarissa	274	‘ mentioned in Mr. Copperfield ’s letter , will perhaps call upon us . When visiting is better for the happiness of all parties , we are glad to receive visits , and return them . When it is better for the happiness of all parties that no visiting should take place , ( as in the case of our brother Francis , and his establishment ) that is quite different . ’
303198	303212	303220	303220	Dora	488	‘ My dearest Dora ! Now , indeed , my own for ever ! ’
303213	303218	303220	303220	Dora	488	‘ Oh , DON’T ! ’

303238	303247	303249	303249	Dora	488	‘ Oh yes , of course I am ! ’
303251	303258	303249	303249	Dora	488	‘ but I am so frightened ! ’
303259	303265	303220	303220	Dora	488	‘ Frightened , my own ? ’

303303	303319	303301	303301	Dora	488	‘ It is n’t any business of his . What a stupid he must be ! ’
303320	303324	303333	303333	her	488	‘ My love ! ’
303338	303345	303333	303333	her	488	‘ He is the best creature ! ’
303346	303358	303360	303360	Dora	488	‘ Oh , but we do n’t want any best creatures ! ’
303362	303366	303367	303367	I	0	‘ My dear , ’
303370	303408	303367	303367	I	0	‘ you will soon know him well , and like him of all things . And here is my aunt coming soon ; and you ’ll like her of all things too , when you know her . ’
303409	303418	303420	303420	Dora	488	‘ No , please do n’t bring her ! ’
303434	303460	303431	303431	her	488	‘ Do n’t . I know she ’s a naughty , mischief - making old thing ! Do n’t let her come here , Doady ! ’
303648	303655	303657	303657	Traddles	306	‘ Nothing could be more satisfactory , ’
303659	303691	303657	303657	Traddles	306	‘ and they are very agreeable old ladies , I am sure . I should n’t be at all surprised if you were to be married years before me , Copperfield . ’
303692	303703	303704	303704	I	0	‘ Does your Sophy play on any instrument , Traddles ? ’
303714	303729	303731	303731	Traddles	306	‘ She knows enough of the piano to teach it to her little sisters , ’
303733	303740	303741	303741	I	0	‘ Does she sing at all ? ’
303744	303762	303741	303741	I	0	‘ Why , she sings ballads , sometimes , to freshen up the others a little when they ’re
303767	303771	303741	303741	I	0	’ said Traddles . ‘
303775	303776	303777	303777	She	6117	’ ‘
303785	303788	303777	303777	She	6117	’ said I. ‘
303793	303797	303777	303777	She	6117	’ said Traddles . ‘
303802	303803	303777	303777	She	6117	’ ‘
303808	304743	303777	303777	She	6117	’ said Traddles . I promised Traddles that he should hear Dora sing , and see some of her flower - painting . He said he should like it very much , and we went home arm in arm in great good humour and delight . I encouraged him to talk about Sophy , on the way ; which he did with a loving reliance on her that I very much admired . I compared her in my mind with Dora , with considerable inward satisfaction ; but I candidly admitted to myself that she seemed to be an excellent kind of girl for Traddles , too . Of course my aunt was immediately made acquainted with the successful issue of the conference , and with all that had been said and done in the course of it . She was happy to see me so happy , and promised to call on Dora ’s aunts without loss of time . But she took such a long walk up and down our rooms that night , while I was writing to Agnes , that I began to think she meant to walk till morning . My letter to Agnes was a fervent and grateful one , narrating all the good effects that had resulted from my following her advice . She wrote , by return of post , to me . Her letter was hopeful , earnest , and cheerful . She was always cheerful from that time . I had my hands more full than ever , now . My daily journeys to Highgate considered , Putney was a long way off ; and I naturally wanted to go there as often as I could . The proposed tea - drinkings being quite impracticable , I compounded with Miss Lavinia for permission to visit every Saturday afternoon , without detriment to my privileged Sundays . So , the close of every week was a delicious time for me ; and I got through the rest of the week by looking forward to it . I was wonderfully relieved to find that my aunt and Dora ’s aunts rubbed on , all things considered , much more smoothly than I could have expected . My aunt made her promised visit within a few days of the conference ; and within a few more days , Dora ’s aunts called upon her , in due state and form . Similar but more friendly exchanges took place afterwards , usually at intervals of three or four weeks . I know that my aunt distressed Dora ’s aunts very much , by utterly setting at naught the dignity of fly - conveyance , and walking out to Putney at extraordinary times , as shortly after breakfast or just before tea ; likewise by wearing her bonnet in any manner that happened to be comfortable to her head , without at all deferring to the prejudices of civilization on that subject . But Dora ’s aunts soon agreed to regard my aunt as an eccentric and somewhat masculine lady , with a strong understanding ; and although my aunt occasionally ruffled the feathers of Dora ’s aunts , by expressing heretical opinions on various points of ceremony , she loved me too well not to sacrifice some of her little peculiarities to the general harmony . The only member of our small society who positively refused to adapt himself to circumstances , was Jip . He never saw my aunt without immediately displaying every tooth in his head , retiring under a chair , and growling incessantly : with now and then a doleful howl , as if she really were too much for his feelings . All kinds of treatment were tried with him , coaxing , scolding , slapping , bringing him to Buckingham Street ( where he instantly dashed at the two cats , to the terror of all beholders ) ; but he never could prevail upon himself to bear my aunt ’s society . He would sometimes think he had got the better of his objection , and be amiable for a few minutes ; and then would put up his snub nose , and howl to that extent , that there was nothing for it but to blind him and put him in the plate - warmer . At length , Dora regularly muffled him in a towel and shut him up there , whenever my aunt was reported at the door . One thing troubled me much , after we had fallen into this quiet train . It was , that Dora seemed by one consent to be regarded like a pretty toy or plaything . My aunt , with whom she gradually became familiar , always called her Little Blossom ; and the pleasure of Miss Lavinia ’s life was to wait upon her , curl her hair , make ornaments for her , and treat her like a pet child . What Miss Lavinia did , her sister did as a matter of course . It was very odd to me ; but they all seemed to treat Dora , in her degree , much as Dora treated Jip in his . I made up my mind to speak to Dora about this ; and one day when we were out walking ( for we were licensed by Miss Lavinia , after a while , to go out walking by ourselves ) , I said to her that I wished she could get them to behave towards her differently . ‘
304751	304755	303777	303777	She	6117	’ I remonstrated , ‘
304762	304763	304756	304756	you	6118	’ ‘
304766	304770	304756	304756	you	6118	’ said Dora . ‘
304773	304779	304756	304756	you	6118	’re going to be cross ! ’
304780	304786	304772	304772	you	6118	‘ Cross , my love ? ’
304787	304792	304756	304756	you	6118	‘ I am sure they ’re
304798	304802	304756	304756	you	6118	’ said Dora , ‘
304808	304809	304772	304772	you	6118	’ ‘
304817	304821	304772	304772	you	6118	’ said I , ‘
304834	304912	304772	304772	you	6118	’ Dora gave me a reproachful look -- the prettiest look!--and then began to sob , saying , if I did n’t like her , why had I ever wanted so much to be engaged to her ? And why did n’t I go away , now , if I could n’t bear her ? What could I do , but kiss away her tears , and tell her how I doted on her , after that ! ‘
304921	304925	304926	304926	you	0	’ said Dora ; ‘
304937	304938	304926	304926	you	0	’ ‘
304962	304963	304935	304935	Doady	591	’ ‘
304972	304983	304985	304985	I	0	’ said Dora , making a rosebud of her mouth ; ‘
304990	305195	304985	304985	I	0	’ I was charmed by her presently asking me , of her own accord , to give her that cookery - book I had once spoken of , and to show her how to keep accounts as I had once promised I would . I brought the volume with me on my next visit ( I got it prettily bound , first , to make it look less dry and more inviting ) ; and as we strolled about the Common , I showed her an old housekeeping - book of my aunt ’s , and gave her a set of tablets , and a pretty little pencil - case and box of leads , to practise housekeeping with . But the cookery - book made Dora ’s head ache , and the figures made her cry . They would n’t add up , she said . So she rubbed them out , and drew little nosegays and likenesses of me and Jip , all over the tablets . Then I playfully tried verbal instruction in domestic matters , as we walked about on a Saturday afternoon . Sometimes , for example , when we passed a butcher ’s shop , I would say : ‘
305228	305263	305208	305208	you	8940	’ My pretty little Dora ’s face would fall , and she would make her mouth into a bud again , as if she would very much prefer to shut mine with a kiss . ‘
305275	305304	305265	305265	you	8940	’ I would repeat , perhaps , if I were very inflexible . Dora would think a little , and then reply , perhaps , with great triumph : ‘
305328	306256	305324	305326	you silly boy	6127	’ So , when I once asked Dora , with an eye to the cookery - book , what she would do , if we were married , and I were to say I should like a nice Irish stew , she replied that she would tell the servant to make it ; and then clapped her little hands together across my arm , and laughed in such a charming manner that she was more delightful than ever . Consequently , the principal use to which the cookery - book was devoted , was being put down in the corner for Jip to stand upon . But Dora was so pleased , when she had trained him to stand upon it without offering to come off , and at the same time to hold the pencil - case in his mouth , that I was very glad I had bought it . And we fell back on the guitar - case , and the flower - painting , and the songs about never leaving off dancing , Ta ra la ! and were as happy as the week was long . I occasionally wished I could venture to hint to Miss Lavinia , that she treated the darling of my heart a little too much like a plaything ; and I sometimes awoke , as it were , wondering to find that I had fallen into the general fault , and treated her like a plaything too -- but not often . CHAPTER 42 . MISCHIEF I feel as if it were not for me to record , even though this manuscript is intended for no eyes but mine , how hard I worked at that tremendous short - hand , and all improvement appertaining to it , in my sense of responsibility to Dora and her aunts . I will only add , to what I have already written of my perseverance at this time of my life , and of a patient and continuous energy which then began to be matured within me , and which I know to be the strong part of my character , if it have any strength at all , that there , on looking back , I find the source of my success . I have been very fortunate in worldly matters ; many men have worked much harder , and not succeeded half so well ; but I never could have done what I have done , without the habits of punctuality , order , and diligence , without the determination to concentrate myself on one object at a time , no matter how quickly its successor should come upon its heels , which I then formed . Heaven knows I write this , in no spirit of self - laudation . The man who reviews his own life , as I do mine , in going on here , from page to page , had need to have been a good man indeed , if he would be spared the sharp consciousness of many talents neglected , many opportunities wasted , many erratic and perverted feelings constantly at war within his breast , and defeating him . I do not hold one natural gift , I dare say , that I have not abused . My meaning simply is , that whatever I have tried to do in life , I have tried with all my heart to do well ; that whatever I have devoted myself to , I have devoted myself to completely ; that in great aims and in small , I have always been thoroughly in earnest . I have never believed it possible that any natural or improved ability can claim immunity from the companionship of the steady , plain , hard - working qualities , and hope to gain its end . There is no such thing as such fulfilment on this earth . Some happy talent , and some fortunate opportunity , may form the two sides of the ladder on which some men mount , but the rounds of that ladder must be made of stuff to stand wear and tear ; and there is no substitute for thorough - going , ardent , and sincere earnestness . Never to put one hand to anything , on which I could throw my whole self ; and never to affect depreciation of my work , whatever it was ; I find , now , to have been my golden rules . How much of the practice I have just reduced to precept , I owe to Agnes , I will not repeat here . My narrative proceeds to Agnes , with a thankful love . She came on a visit of a fortnight to the Doctor ’s . Mr. Wickfield was the Doctor ’s old friend , and the Doctor wished to talk with him , and do him good . It had been matter of conversation with Agnes when she was last in town , and this visit was the result . She and her father came together . I was not much surprised to hear from her that she had engaged to find a lodging in the neighbourhood for Mrs. Heep , whose rheumatic complaint required change of air , and who would be charmed to have it in such company . Neither was I surprised when , on the very next day , Uriah , like a dutiful son , brought his worthy mother to take possession . ‘
306263	306283	306260	306261	Master Copperfield	232	’ said he , as he forced himself upon my company for a turn in the Doctor ’s garden , ‘

306318	306321	306289	306290	a person	869	’ said I. ‘
306329	306333	306324	306324	you	232	’ he returned , ‘
306350	306351	306353	306353	you	232	’ ‘
306364	306381	306353	306353	you	232	’ He gave me a sidelong glance out of his sinister red eyes , and laughed . ‘
306387	306391	306384	306385	Master Copperfield	232	’ he said , ‘
306431	306441	306442	306442	I	0	’ putting his fish - like hand on mine , ‘
306443	306463	306464	306464	His	232	’m not a lady ’s man in general , sir , and I never was , with Mrs. Strong . ’
306479	306485	306487	306487	I.	5382	‘ What do you mean ? ’
306488	306500	306501	306501	he	232	‘ Why , though I am a lawyer , Master Copperfield , ’
306509	306521	306501	306501	he	232	‘ I mean , just at present , what I say . ’
306522	306532	306533	306533	I	0	‘ And what do you mean by your look ? ’
306538	306561	306533	306533	I	0	‘ By my look ? Dear me , Copperfield , that ’s sharp practice ! What do I mean by my look ? ’
306562	306565	306567	306567	I.	5382	‘ Yes , ’
306568	306573	306574	306574	He	232	‘ By your look . ’
306621	306679	306603	306603	he	232	‘ When I was but an umble clerk , she always looked down upon me . She was for ever having my Agnes backwards and forwards at her ouse , and she was for ever being a friend to you , Master Copperfield ; but I was too far beneath her , myself , to be noticed . ’
306680	306683	306685	306685	I	0	‘ Well ? ’
306687	306692	306685	306685	I	0	‘ suppose you were ! ’
306693	306699	306715	306715	he	373	‘ --And beneath him too , ’
306722	306731	306733	306733	I	0	‘ Do n’t you know the Doctor better , ’
306735	306752	306733	306733	I	0	‘ than to suppose him conscious of your existence , when you were not before him ? ’
306786	306809	306766	306766	he	373	‘ Oh dear , I am not referring to the Doctor ! Oh no , poor man ! I mean Mr. Maldon ! ’
306866	306882	306884	306884	Uriah	373	‘ He never could come into the office , without ordering and shoving me about , ’
306886	306921	306922	306922	He	373	‘ One of your fine gentlemen he was ! I was very meek and umble -- and I am . But I did n’t like that sort of thing -- and I do n’t ! ’
306951	306963	306964	306964	he	373	‘ She is one of your lovely women , she is , ’
306979	307056	306964	306964	he	373	‘ and ready to be no friend to such as me , I know . She ’s just the person as would put my Agnes up to higher sort of game . Now , I ai n’t one of your lady ’s men , Master Copperfield ; but I ’ve had eyes in my ed , a pretty long time back . We umble ones have got eyes , mostly speaking -- and we look out of ‘
307059	307081	306964	306964	he	373	’ I endeavoured to appear unconscious and not disquieted , but , I saw in his face , with poor success . ‘
307085	307099	307100	307100	he	0	’m not a - going to let myself be run down , Copperfield , ’
307127	307195	307100	307100	he	0	‘ and I shall do what I can to put a stop to this friendship . I do n’t approve of it . I do n’t mind acknowledging to you that I ’ve got rather a grudging disposition , and want to keep off all intruders . I ai n’t a - going , if I know it , to run the risk of being plotted against . ’
307196	307219	307221	307221	I.	6139	‘ You are always plotting , and delude yourself into the belief that everybody else is doing the like , I think , ’
307222	307229	307230	307230	he	0	‘ Perhaps so , Master Copperfield , ’
307233	307295	307100	307100	he	0	‘ But I ’ve got a motive , as my fellow - partner used to say ; and I go at it tooth and nail . I must n’t be put upon , as a numble person , too much . I ca n’t allow people in my way . Really they must come out of the cart , Master Copperfield ! ’
307296	307303	307305	307305	I.	6139	‘ I do n’t understand you , ’
307306	307313	307314	307314	he	0	‘ Do n’t you , though ? ’
307323	307325	307320	307320	his	0	‘ I ’m
307362	307363	307367	307367	him	0	’ ‘
307369	307791	307367	307367	him	0	’ I replied , as carelessly as I could . Uriah stopped short , put his hands between his great knobs of knees , and doubled himself up with laughter . With perfectly silent laughter . Not a sound escaped from him . I was so repelled by his odious behaviour , particularly by this concluding instance , that I turned away without any ceremony ; and left him doubled up in the middle of the garden , like a scarecrow in want of support . It was not on that evening ; but , as I well remember , on the next evening but one , which was a Sunday ; that I took Agnes to see Dora . I had arranged the visit , beforehand , with Miss Lavinia ; and Agnes was expected to tea . I was in a flutter of pride and anxiety ; pride in my dear little betrothed , and anxiety that Agnes should like her . All the way to Putney , Agnes being inside the stage - coach , and I outside , I pictured Dora to myself in every one of the pretty looks I knew so well ; now making up my mind that I should like her to look exactly as she looked at such a time , and then doubting whether I should not prefer her looking as she looked at such another time ; and almost worrying myself into a fever about it . I was troubled by no doubt of her being very pretty , in any case ; but it fell out that I had never seen her look so well . She was not in the drawing - room when I presented Agnes to her little aunts , but was shyly keeping out of the way . I knew where to look for her , now ; and sure enough I found her stopping her ears again , behind the same dull old door . At first she would n’t come at all ; and then she pleaded for five minutes by my watch . When at length she put her arm through mine , to be taken to the drawing - room , her charming little face was flushed , and had never been so pretty . But , when we went into the room , and it turned pale , she was ten thousand times prettier yet . Dora was afraid of Agnes . She had told me that she knew Agnes was ‘
307794	308068	308069	308069	I	0	’ . But when she saw her looking at once so cheerful and so earnest , and so thoughtful , and so good , she gave a faint little cry of pleased surprise , and just put her affectionate arms round Agnes ’s neck , and laid her innocent cheek against her face . I never was so happy . I never was so pleased as when I saw those two sit down together , side by side . As when I saw my little darling looking up so naturally to those cordial eyes . As when I saw the tender , beautiful regard which Agnes cast upon her . Miss Lavinia and Miss Clarissa partook , in their way , of my joy . It was the pleasantest tea - table in the world . Miss Clarissa presided . I cut and handed the sweet seed - cake -- the little sisters had a bird - like fondness for picking up seeds and pecking at sugar ; Miss Lavinia looked on with benignant patronage , as if our happy love were all her work ; and we were perfectly contented with ourselves and one another . The gentle cheerfulness of Agnes went to all their hearts . Her quiet interest in everything that interested Dora ; her manner of making acquaintance with Jip ( who responded instantly ) ; her pleasant way , when Dora was ashamed to come over to her usual seat by me ; her modest grace and ease , eliciting a crowd of blushing little marks of confidence from Dora ; seemed to make our circle quite complete . ‘
308074	308081	308069	308069	I	0	’ said Dora , after tea , ‘
308112	308232	308107	308108	Julia Mills	525	’ I have omitted to mention it , by the by . Miss Mills had sailed , and Dora and I had gone aboard a great East Indiaman at Gravesend to see her ; and we had had preserved ginger , and guava , and other delicacies of that sort for lunch ; and we had left Miss Mills weeping on a camp - stool on the quarter - deck , with a large new diary under her arm , in which the original reflections awakened by the contemplation of Ocean were to be recorded under lock and key . Agnes said she was afraid I must have given her an unpromising character ; but Dora corrected that directly . ‘
308236	308246	308107	308108	Julia Mills	525	’ she said , shaking her curls at me ; ‘
308268	308269	308252	308252	He	6142	’ ‘
308285	308293	308252	308252	He	6142	’ said Agnes , with a smile ; ‘
308301	308302	308252	308252	He	6142	’ ‘
308310	308319	308306	308306	me	0	’ said Dora , in her coaxing way , ‘
308324	308406	308409	308409	you	6143	’ We made merry about Dora ’s wanting to be liked , and Dora said I was a goose , and she did n’t like me at any rate , and the short evening flew away on gossamer - wings . The time was at hand when the coach was to call for us . I was standing alone before the fire , when Dora came stealing softly in , to give me that usual precious little kiss before I went . ‘
308427	308455	308418	308419	a friend	1563	’ said Dora , her bright eyes shining very brightly , and her little right hand idly busying itself with one of the buttons of my coat , ‘
308464	308465	308456	308456	I	0	’ ‘
308469	308473	308425	308425	Doady	591	’ said I , ‘
308477	308478	308480	308480	you	6143	’ ‘
308486	308495	308480	308480	you	6143	’ returned Dora , without looking at me . ‘
308502	308503	308497	308497	you	6143	’ ‘
308509	308510	308497	308497	you	6143	’ ‘
308515	308527	308497	308497	you	6143	’ said Dora , still turning the button round and round , ‘
308540	308541	308530	308530	Agnes	375	’ ‘
308547	308551	308530	308530	Agnes	375	’ I replied ; ‘
308564	308565	308566	308566	I	0	’ ‘
308577	308589	308569	308569	you	6143	’ said Dora , beginning on another button of my coat . ‘
308605	308606	308608	308608	you	6143	’ ‘
308616	308625	308608	308608	you	6143	’ said Dora , going to another button . ‘
308633	309061	308608	308608	you	6143	’ said I , gaily . I wondered what she was thinking about , as I glanced in admiring silence at the little soft hand travelling up the row of buttons on my coat , and at the clustering hair that lay against my breast , and at the lashes of her downcast eyes , slightly rising as they followed her idle fingers . At length her eyes were lifted up to mine , and she stood on tiptoe to give me , more thoughtfully than usual , that precious little kiss -- once , twice , three times -- and went out of the room . They all came back together within five minutes afterwards , and Dora ’s unusual thoughtfulness was quite gone then . She was laughingly resolved to put Jip through the whole of his performances , before the coach came . They took some time ( not so much on account of their variety , as Jip ’s reluctance ) , and were still unfinished when it was heard at the door . There was a hurried but affectionate parting between Agnes and herself ; and Dora was to write to Agnes ( who was not to mind her letters being foolish , she said ) , and Agnes was to write to Dora ; and they had a second parting at the coach door , and a third when Dora , in spite of the remonstrances of Miss Lavinia , would come running out once more to remind Agnes at the coach window about writing , and to shake her curls at me on the box . The stage - coach was to put us down near Covent Garden , where we were to take another stage - coach for Highgate . I was impatient for the short walk in the interval , that Agnes might praise Dora to me . Ah ! what praise it was ! How lovingly and fervently did it commend the pretty creature I had won , with all her artless graces best displayed , to my most gentle care ! How thoughtfully remind me , yet with no pretence of doing so , of the trust in which I held the orphan child ! Never , never , had I loved Dora so deeply and truly , as I loved her that night . When we had again alighted , and were walking in the starlight along the quiet road that led to the Doctor ’s house , I told Agnes it was her doing . ‘
309069	309073	309074	309074	you	6152	’ said I , ‘
309094	309095	309087	309087	you	6152	’ ‘
309100	309104	309087	309087	you	6152	’ she returned , ‘
309108	309130	309087	309087	you	6152	’ The clear tone of her voice , going straight to my heart , made it natural to me to say : ‘
309173	309174	309162	309162	I	0	’ ‘
309181	309185	309175	309175	I	0	’ she said ; ‘
309195	309218	309186	309186	I	0	’ I glanced at the serene face looking upward , and thought it was the stars that made it seem so noble . ‘
309227	309236	309186	309186	I	0	’ said Agnes , after a few moments . ‘
309241	309245	309186	309186	I	0	’ said I , ‘
309274	309275	309186	309186	I	0	’ ‘

If I did her wrong ; as I fear I did , in taking advantage ( but I never meant it ) of her gratitude and her affection ; I ask pardon of that lady , in my heart ! ’

That she does regard him with some innocent regret , with some blameless thoughts of what might have been , but for me , is , I fear , too true . Much that I have seen , but not noted , has come back upon me with new meaning , during this last trying hour . But , beyond this , gentlemen , the dear lady ’s name never must be coupled with a word , a breath , of doubt . ’
312414	312540	312409	312409	he	6215	‘ It only remains for me , to bear the knowledge of the unhappiness I have occasioned , as submissively as I can . It is she who should reproach ; not I.

And when the time comes -- may it come soon , if it be His merciful pleasure!--when my death shall release her from constraint , I shall close my eyes upon her honoured face , with unbounded confidence and love ; and leave her , with no sorrow then , to happier and brighter days . ’

Mr. Micawber may have occasionally given a bill without consulting me , or he may have misled me as to the period when that obligation would become due . This has actually happened . But , in general , Mr. Micawber has had no secrets from the bosom of affection -- I allude to his wife -- and has invariably , on our retirement to rest , recalled the events of the day . ‘

The pecuniary means of meeting our expenses , kept down to the utmost farthing , are obtained from him with great difficulty , and even under fearful threats that he will Settle himself ( the exact expression ) ; and he inexorably refuses to give any explanation whatever of this distracting policy . ‘

CHAPTER 43 . ANOTHER RETROSPECT Once again , let me pause upon a memorable period of my life . Let me stand aside , to see the phantoms of those days go by me , accompanying the shadow of myself , in dim procession . Weeks , months , seasons , pass along . They seem little more than a summer day and a winter evening . Now , the Common where I walk with Dora is all in bloom , a field of bright gold ; and now the unseen heather lies in mounds and bunches underneath a covering of snow . In a breath , the river that flows through our Sunday walks is sparkling in the summer sun , is ruffled by the winter wind , or thickened with drifting heaps of ice . Faster than ever river ran towards the sea , it flashes , darkens , and rolls away . Not a thread changes , in the house of the two little bird - like ladies . The clock ticks over the fireplace , the weather - glass hangs in the hall . Neither clock nor weather - glass is ever right ; but we believe in both , devoutly . I have come legally to man ’s estate . I have attained the dignity of twenty - one . But this is a sort of dignity that may be thrust upon one . Let me think what I have achieved . I have tamed that savage stenographic mystery . I make a respectable income by it . I am in high repute for my accomplishment in all pertaining to the art , and am joined with eleven others in reporting the debates in Parliament for a Morning Newspaper . Night after night , I record predictions that never come to pass , professions that are never fulfilled , explanations that are only meant to mystify . I wallow in words . Britannia , that unfortunate female , is always before me , like a trussed fowl : skewered through and through with office - pens , and bound hand and foot with red tape . I am sufficiently behind the scenes to know the worth of political life . I am quite an Infidel about it , and shall never be converted . My dear old Traddles has tried his hand at the same pursuit , but it is not in Traddles ’s way . He is perfectly good - humoured respecting his failure , and reminds me that he always did consider himself slow . He has occasional employment on the same newspaper , in getting up the facts of dry subjects , to be written about and embellished by more fertile minds . He is called to the bar ; and with admirable industry and self - denial has scraped another hundred pounds together , to fee a Conveyancer whose chambers he attends . A great deal of very hot port wine was consumed at his call ; and , considering the figure , I should think the Inner Temple must have made a profit by it . I have come out in another way . I have taken with fear and trembling to authorship . I wrote a little something , in secret , and sent it to a magazine , and it was published in the magazine . Since then , I have taken heart to write a good many trifling pieces . Now , I am regularly paid for them . Altogether , I am well off , when I tell my income on the fingers of my left hand , I pass the third finger and take in the fourth to the middle joint . We have removed , from Buckingham Street , to a pleasant little cottage very near the one I looked at , when my enthusiasm first came on . My aunt , however ( who has sold the house at Dover , to good advantage ) , is not going to remain here , but intends removing herself to a still more tiny cottage close at hand . What does this portend ? My marriage ? Yes ! Yes ! I am going to be married to Dora ! Miss Lavinia and Miss Clarissa have given their consent ; and if ever canary birds were in a flutter , they are . Miss Lavinia , self - charged with the superintendence of my darling ’s wardrobe , is constantly cutting out brown - paper cuirasses , and differing in opinion from a highly respectable young man , with a long bundle , and a yard measure under his arm . A dressmaker , always stabbed in the breast with a needle and thread , boards and lodges in the house ; and seems to me , eating , drinking , or sleeping , never to take her thimble off . They make a lay - figure of my dear . They are always sending for her to come and try something on . We ca n’t be happy together for five minutes in the evening , but some intrusive female knocks at the door , and says , ‘
316641	317141	317142	317142	I	0	’ Miss Clarissa and my aunt roam all over London , to find out articles of furniture for Dora and me to look at . It would be better for them to buy the goods at once , without this ceremony of inspection ; for , when we go to see a kitchen fender and meat - screen , Dora sees a Chinese house for Jip , with little bells on the top , and prefers that . And it takes a long time to accustom Jip to his new residence , after we have bought it ; whenever he goes in or out , he makes all the little bells ring , and is horribly frightened . Peggotty comes up to make herself useful , and falls to work immediately . Her department appears to be , to clean everything over and over again . She rubs everything that can be rubbed , until it shines , like her own honest forehead , with perpetual friction . And now it is , that I begin to see her solitary brother passing through the dark streets at night , and looking , as he goes , among the wandering faces . I never speak to him at such an hour . I know too well , as his grave figure passes onward , what he seeks , and what he dreads . Why does Traddles look so important when he calls upon me this afternoon in the Commons -- where I still occasionally attend , for form ’s sake , when I have time ? The realization of my boyish day - dreams is at hand . I am going to take out the licence . It is a little document to do so much ; and Traddles contemplates it , as it lies upon my desk , half in admiration , half in awe . There are the names , in the sweet old visionary connexion , David Copperfield and Dora Spenlow ; and there , in the corner , is that Parental Institution , the Stamp Office , which is so benignantly interested in the various transactions of human life , looking down upon our Union ; and there is the Archbishop of Canterbury invoking a blessing on us in print , and doing it as cheap as could possibly be expected . Nevertheless , I am in a dream , a flustered , happy , hurried dream . I ca n’t believe that it is going to be ; and yet I ca n’t believe but that everyone I pass in the street , must have some kind of perception , that I am to be married the day after tomorrow . The Surrogate knows me , when I go down to be sworn ; and disposes of me easily , as if there were a Masonic understanding between us . Traddles is not at all wanted , but is in attendance as my general backer . ‘
317155	317161	317147	317147	you	6295	’ I say to Traddles , ‘
317180	317181	317173	317173	I	0	’ ‘
317193	317197	317183	317183	you	0	’ he replies . ‘

317240	317244	317232	317232	you	6295	’ I ask . ‘
317248	317281	317232	317232	you	6295	’ says Traddles , looking at his plain old silver watch -- the very watch he once took a wheel out of , at school , to make a water - mill . ‘
317294	317295	317232	317232	you	6295	’ ‘
317307	317308	317300	317300	Her	6298	’ ‘
317317	317321	317309	317309	I	0	’ says Traddles , ‘
317391	317953	317384	317384	I	0	’ I hear him , and shake hands with him ; and we talk , and walk , and dine , and so on ; but I do n’t believe it . Nothing is real . Sophy arrives at the house of Dora ’s aunts , in due course . She has the most agreeable of faces,--not absolutely beautiful , but extraordinarily pleasant,--and is one of the most genial , unaffected , frank , engaging creatures I have ever seen . Traddles presents her to us with great pride ; and rubs his hands for ten minutes by the clock , with every individual hair upon his head standing on tiptoe , when I congratulate him in a corner on his choice . I have brought Agnes from the Canterbury coach , and her cheerful and beautiful face is among us for the second time . Agnes has a great liking for Traddles , and it is capital to see them meet , and to observe the glory of Traddles as he commends the dearest girl in the world to her acquaintance . Still I do n’t believe it . We have a delightful evening , and are supremely happy ; but I do n’t believe it yet . I ca n’t collect myself . I ca n’t check off my happiness as it takes place . I feel in a misty and unsettled kind of state ; as if I had got up very early in the morning a week or two ago , and had never been to bed since . I ca n’t make out when yesterday was . I seem to have been carrying the licence about , in my pocket , many months . Next day , too , when we all go in a flock to see the house -- our house -- Dora ’s and mine -- I am quite unable to regard myself as its master . I seem to be there , by permission of somebody else . I half expect the real master to come home presently , and say he is glad to see me . Such a beautiful little house as it is , with everything so bright and new ; with the flowers on the carpets looking as if freshly gathered , and the green leaves on the paper as if they had just come out ; with the spotless muslin curtains , and the blushing rose - coloured furniture , and Dora ’s garden hat with the blue ribbon -- do I remember , now , how I loved her in such another hat when I first knew her!--already hanging on its little peg ; the guitar - case quite at home on its heels in a corner ; and everybody tumbling over Jip ’s pagoda , which is much too big for the establishment . Another happy evening , quite as unreal as all the rest of it , and I steal into the usual room before going away . Dora is not there . I suppose they have not done trying on yet . Miss Lavinia peeps in , and tells me mysteriously that she will not be long . She is rather long , notwithstanding ; but by and by I hear a rustling at the door , and someone taps . I say , ‘
317957	318061	317384	317384	I	0	’ but someone taps again . I go to the door , wondering who it is ; there , I meet a pair of bright eyes , and a blushing face ; they are Dora ’s eyes and face , and Miss Lavinia has dressed her in tomorrow ’s dress , bonnet and all , for me to see . I take my little wife to my heart ; and Miss Lavinia gives a little scream because I tumble the bonnet , and Dora laughs and cries at once , because I am so pleased ; and I believe it less than ever . ‘
318070	318083	318063	318063	you	6304	’ says Dora . Pretty ! I should rather think I did . ‘
318094	318522	318086	318086	you	6304	’ says Dora . The topic is fraught with such danger to the bonnet , that Miss Lavinia gives another little scream , and begs me to understand that Dora is only to be looked at , and on no account to be touched . So Dora stands in a delightful state of confusion for a minute or two , to be admired ; and then takes off her bonnet -- looking so natural without it!--and runs away with it in her hand ; and comes dancing down again in her own familiar dress , and asks Jip if I have got a beautiful little wife , and whether he ’ll forgive her for being married , and kneels down to make him stand upon the cookery - book , for the last time in her single life . I go home , more incredulous than ever , to a lodging that I have hard by ; and get up very early in the morning , to ride to the Highgate road and fetch my aunt . I have never seen my aunt in such state . She is dressed in lavender - coloured silk , and has a white bonnet on , and is amazing . Janet has dressed her , and is there to look at me . Peggotty is ready to go to church , intending to behold the ceremony from the gallery . Mr. Dick , who is to give my darling to me at the altar , has had his hair curled . Traddles , whom I have taken up by appointment at the turnpike , presents a dazzling combination of cream colour and light blue ; and both he and Mr. Dick have a general effect about them of being all gloves . No doubt I see this , because I know it is so ; but I am astray , and seem to see nothing . Nor do I believe anything whatever . Still , as we drive along in an open carriage , this fairy marriage is real enough to fill me with a sort of wondering pity for the unfortunate people who have no part in it , but are sweeping out the shops , and going to their daily occupations . My aunt sits with my hand in hers all the way . When we stop a little way short of the church , to put down Peggotty , whom we have brought on the box , she gives it a squeeze , and me a kiss . ‘
318546	318547	318542	318542	Baby	540	’ ‘
318562	318563	318559	318560	dear aunt	6308	’ ‘
318568	319588	318566	318566	child	8492	’ says my aunt ; and gives her hand in overflowing cordiality to Traddles , who then gives his to Mr. Dick , who then gives his to me , who then gives mine to Traddles , and then we come to the church door . The church is calm enough , I am sure ; but it might be a steam - power loom in full action , for any sedative effect it has on me . I am too far gone for that . The rest is all a more or less incoherent dream . A dream of their coming in with Dora ; of the pew - opener arranging us , like a drill - sergeant , before the altar rails ; of my wondering , even then , why pew - openers must always be the most disagreeable females procurable , and whether there is any religious dread of a disastrous infection of good - humour which renders it indispensable to set those vessels of vinegar upon the road to Heaven . Of the clergyman and clerk appearing ; of a few boatmen and some other people strolling in ; of an ancient mariner behind me , strongly flavouring the church with rum ; of the service beginning in a deep voice , and our all being very attentive . Of Miss Lavinia , who acts as a semi - auxiliary bridesmaid , being the first to cry , and of her doing homage ( as I take it ) to the memory of Pidger , in sobs ; of Miss Clarissa applying a smelling - bottle ; of Agnes taking care of Dora ; of my aunt endeavouring to represent herself as a model of sternness , with tears rolling down her face ; of little Dora trembling very much , and making her responses in faint whispers . Of our kneeling down together , side by side ; of Dora ’s trembling less and less , but always clasping Agnes by the hand ; of the service being got through , quietly and gravely ; of our all looking at each other in an April state of smiles and tears , when it is over ; of my young wife being hysterical in the vestry , and crying for her poor papa , her dear papa . Of her soon cheering up again , and our signing the register all round . Of my going into the gallery for Peggotty to bring her to sign it ; of Peggotty ’s hugging me in a corner , and telling me she saw my own dear mother married ; of its being over , and our going away . Of my walking so proudly and lovingly down the aisle with my sweet wife upon my arm , through a mist of half - seen people , pulpits , monuments , pews , fonts , organs , and church windows , in which there flutter faint airs of association with my childish church at home , so long ago . Of their whispering , as we pass , what a youthful couple we are , and what a pretty little wife she is . Of our all being so merry and talkative in the carriage going back . Of Sophy telling us that when she saw Traddles ( whom I had entrusted with the licence ) asked for it , she almost fainted , having been convinced that he would contrive to lose it , or to have his pocket picked . Of Agnes laughing gaily ; and of Dora being so fond of Agnes that she will not be separated from her , but still keeps her hand . Of there being a breakfast , with abundance of things , pretty and substantial , to eat and drink , whereof I partake , as I should do in any other dream , without the least perception of their flavour ; eating and drinking , as I may say , nothing but love and marriage , and no more believing in the viands than in anything else . Of my making a speech in the same dreamy fashion , without having an idea of what I want to say , beyond such as may be comprehended in the full conviction that I have n’t said it . Of our being very sociably and simply happy ( always in a dream though ) ; and of Jip ’s having wedding cake , and its not agreeing with him afterwards . Of the pair of hired post - horses being ready , and of Dora ’s going away to change her dress . Of my aunt and Miss Clarissa remaining with us ; and our walking in the garden ; and my aunt , who has made quite a speech at breakfast touching Dora ’s aunts , being mightily amused with herself , but a little proud of it too . Of Dora ’s being ready , and of Miss Lavinia ’s hovering about her , loth to lose the pretty toy that has given her so much pleasant occupation . Of Dora ’s making a long series of surprised discoveries that she has forgotten all sorts of little things ; and of everybody ’s running everywhere to fetch them . Of their all closing about Dora , when at last she begins to say good - bye , looking , with their bright colours and ribbons , like a bed of flowers . Of my darling being almost smothered among the flowers , and coming out , laughing and crying both together , to my jealous arms . Of my wanting to carry Jip ( who is to go along with us ) , and Dora ’s saying no , that she must carry him , or else he ’ll think she do n’t like him any more , now she is married , and will break his heart . Of our going , arm in arm , and Dora stopping and looking back , and saying , ‘
319605	319691	318566	318566	child	8492	’ and bursting into tears . Of her waving her little hand , and our going away once more . Of her once more stopping , and looking back , and hurrying to Agnes , and giving Agnes , above all the others , her last kisses and farewells . We drive away together , and I awake from the dream . I believe it at last . It is my dear , dear , little wife beside me , whom I love so well ! ‘
319701	319705	319693	319693	you	6311	’ says Dora , ‘
319713	320402	319708	319708	you	6311	’ I have stood aside to see the phantoms of those days go by me . They are gone , and I resume the journey of my story . CHAPTER 44 . OUR HOUSEKEEPING It was a strange condition of things , the honeymoon being over , and the bridesmaids gone home , when I found myself sitting down in my own small house with Dora ; quite thrown out of employment , as I may say , in respect of the delicious old occupation of making love . It seemed such an extraordinary thing to have Dora always there . It was so unaccountable not to be obliged to go out to see her , not to have any occasion to be tormenting myself about her , not to have to write to her , not to be scheming and devising opportunities of being alone with her . Sometimes of an evening , when I looked up from my writing , and saw her seated opposite , I would lean back in my chair , and think how queer it was that there we were , alone together as a matter of course -- nobody ’s business any more -- all the romance of our engagement put away upon a shelf , to rust -- no one to please but one another -- one another to please , for life . When there was a debate , and I was kept out very late , it seemed so strange to me , as I was walking home , to think that Dora was at home ! It was such a wonderful thing , at first , to have her coming softly down to talk to me as I ate my supper . It was such a stupendous thing to know for certain that she put her hair in papers . It was altogether such an astonishing event to see her do it ! I doubt whether two young birds could have known less about keeping house , than I and my pretty Dora did . We had a servant , of course . She kept house for us . I have still a latent belief that she must have been Mrs. Crupp ’s daughter in disguise , we had such an awful time of it with Mary Anne . Her name was Paragon . Her nature was represented to us , when we engaged her , as being feebly expressed in her name . She had a written character , as large as a proclamation ; and , according to this document , could do everything of a domestic nature that ever I heard of , and a great many things that I never did hear of . She was a woman in the prime of life ; of a severe countenance ; and subject ( particularly in the arms ) to a sort of perpetual measles or fiery rash . She had a cousin in the Life - Guards , with such long legs that he looked like the afternoon shadow of somebody else . His shell - jacket was as much too little for him as he was too big for the premises . He made the cottage smaller than it need have been , by being so very much out of proportion to it . Besides which , the walls were not thick , and , whenever he passed the evening at our house , we always knew of it by hearing one continual growl in the kitchen . Our treasure was warranted sober and honest . I am therefore willing to believe that she was in a fit when we found her under the boiler ; and that the deficient tea - spoons were attributable to the dustman . But she preyed upon our minds dreadfully . We felt our inexperience , and were unable to help ourselves . We should have been at her mercy , if she had had any ; but she was a remorseless woman , and had none . She was the cause of our first little quarrel . ‘
320407	320415	320417	320417	you	6313	’ I said one day to Dora , ‘
320427	320428	320417	320417	you	6313	’ ‘
320433	320446	320431	320431	Doady	591	’ inquired Dora , looking up , innocently , from her drawing . ‘
320464	320482	320431	320431	Doady	591	’ Dora glanced wistfully at the clock , and hinted that she thought it was too fast . ‘
320490	320499	320431	320431	Doady	591	’ said I , referring to my watch , ‘
320508	320554	320431	320431	Doady	591	’ My little wife came and sat upon my knee , to coax me to be quiet , and drew a line with her pencil down the middle of my nose ; but I could n’t dine off that , though it was very agreeable . ‘
320563	320567	320557	320557	you	1085	’ said I , ‘
320580	320581	320577	320578	Mary Anne	318	’ ‘
320593	320597	320591	320591	Doady	591	’ said Dora . ‘
320604	320609	320601	320602	my love	1085	’ I gently asked . ‘
320620	320624	320626	320626	she	318	’ said Dora , ‘
320631	320656	320626	320626	she	318	’ I thought this sentiment so incompatible with the establishment of any system of check on Mary Anne , that I frowned a little . ‘
320669	320722	320626	320626	she	318	’ said Dora , and still being on my knee , she traced them with her pencil ; putting it to her rosy lips to make it mark blacker , and working at my forehead with a quaint little mockery of being industrious , that quite delighted me in spite of myself . ‘
320729	320733	320725	320727	a good child	6320	’ said Dora , ‘

320789	320793	320785	320787	My precious wife	6322	’ said I , ‘
320829	320852	320828	320828	dear	8941	’ ; what a little hand it was to hold , and what a tiny wedding - ring it was to see ! ‘

320887	320893	320828	320828	dear	8941	’ replied Dora , faintly . ‘

320934	320944	320946	320946	Dora	488	‘ Oh , but reasoning is worse than scolding ! ’
320951	320988	320946	320946	Dora	488	‘ I did n’t marry to be reasoned with . If you meant to reason with such a poor little thing as I am , you ought to have told me so , you cruel boy ! ’

321057	321063	321038	321038	I	0	‘ Dora , my darling ! ’
321064	321092	321094	321094	Dora	488	‘ No , I am not your darling . Because you must be sorry that you married me , or else you would n’t reason with me ! ’
321117	321124	321126	321126	I	0	‘ Now , my own Dora , ’
321128	321231	321126	321126	I	0	‘ you are very childish , and are talking nonsense . You must remember , I am sure , that I was obliged to go out yesterday when dinner was half over ; and that , the day before , I was made quite unwell by being obliged to eat underdone veal in a hurry ; today , I do n’t dine at all -- and I am afraid to say how long we waited for breakfast -- and then the water did n’t boil . I do n’t mean to reproach you , my dear , but this is not comfortable . ’
321232	321249	321251	321251	Dora	488	‘ Oh , you cruel , cruel boy , to say I am a disagreeable wife ! ’
321253	321269	321251	321251	Dora	488	‘ Now , my dear Dora , you must know that I never said that ! ’
321270	321279	321281	321281	Dora	488	‘ You said , I was n’t comfortable ! ’
321283	321292	321281	321281	Dora	488	‘ I said the housekeeping was not comfortable ! ’

She was so pathetic in her sobbing and bewailing , that I felt as if I had said I do n’t know what to hurt her . I was obliged to hurry away ; I was kept out late ; and I felt all night such pangs of remorse as made me miserable . I had the conscience of an assassin , and was haunted by a vague sense of enormous wickedness . It was two or three hours past midnight when I got home . I found my aunt , in our house , sitting up for me . ‘

One of our first feats in the housekeeping way was a little dinner to Traddles . I met him in town , and asked him to walk out with me that afternoon . He readily consenting , I wrote to Dora , saying I would bring him home . It was pleasant weather , and on the road we made my domestic happiness the theme of conversation . Traddles was very full of it ; and said , that , picturing himself with such a home , and Sophy waiting and preparing for him , he could think of nothing wanting to complete his bliss . I could not have wished for a prettier little wife at the opposite end of the table , but I certainly could have wished , when we sat down , for a little more room . I did not know how it was , but though there were only two of us , we were at once always cramped for room , and yet had always room enough to lose everything in . I suspect it may have been because nothing had a place of its own , except Jip ’s pagoda , which invariably blocked up the main thoroughfare . On the present occasion , Traddles was so hemmed in by the pagoda and the guitar - case , and Dora ’s flower - painting , and my writing - table , that I had serious doubts of the possibility of his using his knife and fork ; but he protested , with his own good - humour , ‘
323775	324034	323773	323773	Oceans	602	’ There was another thing I could have wished , namely , that Jip had never been encouraged to walk about the tablecloth during dinner . I began to think there was something disorderly in his being there at all , even if he had not been in the habit of putting his foot in the salt or the melted butter . On this occasion he seemed to think he was introduced expressly to keep Traddles at bay ; and he barked at my old friend , and made short runs at his plate , with such undaunted pertinacity , that he may be said to have engrossed the conversation . However , as I knew how tender - hearted my dear Dora was , and how sensitive she would be to any slight upon her favourite , I hinted no objection . For similar reasons I made no allusion to the skirmishing plates upon the floor ; or to the disreputable appearance of the castors , which were all at sixes and sevens , and looked drunk ; or to the further blockade of Traddles by wandering vegetable dishes and jugs . I could not help wondering in my own mind , as I contemplated the boiled leg of mutton before me , previous to carving it , how it came to pass that our joints of meat were of such extraordinary shapes -- and whether our butcher contracted for all the deformed sheep that came into the world ; but I kept my reflections to myself . ‘
324038	324044	323773	323773	Oceans	602	’ said I to Dora , ‘
324053	324077	324047	324047	you	1085	’ I could not imagine why Dora had been making tempting little faces at me , as if she wanted to kiss me . ‘
324082	324088	324047	324047	you	1085	’ said Dora , timidly . ‘
324094	324100	324101	324101	Ye	8941	’ said I , delighted . ‘
324107	324111	324105	324105	Doady	591	’ said Dora . ‘
324119	324132	324105	324105	Doady	591	’ I exclaimed , laying down the carving - knife and fork . ‘

324149	324153	324143	324143	Ye	8941	’ said Dora , ‘
324194	324208	324188	324188	They	6391	’ Here Dora shook her head , and diamonds twinkled in her eyes . ‘
324217	324220	324188	324188	They	6391	’ said I. ‘
324230	324231	324188	324188	They	6391	’ ‘
324239	324253	324188	324188	They	6391	’ said Dora , trying very hard , and looking very much distressed . ‘
324260	324269	324255	324255	you	591	’ said Traddles , cheerfully examining the dish , ‘
324297	324649	324650	324650	I	0	’ They never had been opened ; and we had no oyster - knives -- and could n’t have used them if we had ; so we looked at the oysters and ate the mutton . At least we ate as much of it as was done , and made up with capers . If I had permitted him , I am satisfied that Traddles would have made a perfect savage of himself , and eaten a plateful of raw meat , to express enjoyment of the repast ; but I would hear of no such immolation on the altar of friendship , and we had a course of bacon instead ; there happening , by good fortune , to be cold bacon in the larder . My poor little wife was in such affliction when she thought I should be annoyed , and in such a state of joy when she found I was not , that the discomfiture I had subdued , very soon vanished , and we passed a happy evening ; Dora sitting with her arm on my chair while Traddles and I discussed a glass of wine , and taking every opportunity of whispering in my ear that it was so good of me not to be a cruel , cross old boy . By and by she made tea for us ; which it was so pretty to see her do , as if she was busying herself with a set of doll ’s tea - things , that I was not particular about the quality of the beverage . Then Traddles and I played a game or two at cribbage ; and Dora singing to the guitar the while , it seemed to me as if our courtship and marriage were a tender dream of mine , and the night when I first listened to her voice were not yet over . When Traddles went away , and I came back into the parlour from seeing him out , my wife planted her chair close to mine , and sat down by my side . ‘

324758	324783	324756	324756	Agnes	375	’ Her hands were clasped upon my shoulder , and her chin rested on them , and her blue eyes looked quietly into mine . ‘
324787	324791	324756	324756	Agnes	375	’ I asked . ‘
324810	324814	324803	324803	I	0	’ said Dora . ‘
324857	324860	324849	324849	she	375	’ said I. ‘
324874	324881	324869	324869	you	1085	’ inquired Dora , without moving . ‘
324886	324893	324869	324869	you	1085	’ I asked with a smile . ‘
324900	324911	324912	324914	Child - wife	6402	’ she said , shaking her curls for a moment . ‘
324916	324959	324960	324960	I	0	’ I laughingly asked my child - wife what her fancy was in desiring to be so called . She answered without moving , otherwise than as the arm I twined about her may have brought her blue eyes nearer to me : ‘
325078	325349	325583	325584	a lion’--which	6407	’ I had not been serious with her ; having no idea until now , that she was serious herself . But her affectionate nature was so happy in what I now said to her with my whole heart , that her face became a laughing one before her glittering eyes were dry . She was soon my child - wife indeed ; sitting down on the floor outside the Chinese House , ringing all the little bells one after another , to punish Jip for his recent bad behaviour ; while Jip lay blinking in the doorway with his head out , even too lazy to be teased . This appeal of Dora ’s made a strong impression on me . I look back on the time I write of ; I invoke the innocent figure that I dearly loved , to come out from the mists and shadows of the past , and turn its gentle head towards me once again ; and I can still declare that this one little speech was constantly in my memory . I may not have used it to the best account ; I was young and inexperienced ; but I never turned a deaf ear to its artless pleading . Dora told me , shortly afterwards , that she was going to be a wonderful housekeeper . Accordingly , she polished the tablets , pointed the pencil , bought an immense account - book , carefully stitched up with a needle and thread all the leaves of the Cookery Book which Jip had torn , and made quite a desperate little attempt ‘
325353	325581	325588	325588	his	6408	’ , as she called it . But the figures had the old obstinate propensity -- they WOULD NOT add up . When she had entered two or three laborious items in the account - book , Jip would walk over the page , wagging his tail , and smear them all out . Her own little right - hand middle finger got steeped to the very bone in ink ; and I think that was the only decided result obtained . Sometimes , of an evening , when I was at home and at work -- for I wrote a good deal now , and was beginning in a small way to be known as a writer -- I would lay down my pen , and watch my child - wife trying to be good . First of all , she would bring out the immense account - book , and lay it down upon the table , with a deep sigh . Then she would open it at the place where Jip had made it illegible last night , and call Jip up , to look at his misdeeds . This would occasion a diversion in Jip ’s favour , and some inking of his nose , perhaps , as a penalty . Then she would tell Jip to lie down on the table instantly , ‘
325674	325688	325655	325655	she	6409	‘ Oh , it ’s a talking pen , and will disturb Doady ! ’

325866	325889	325857	325857	Dora	488	‘ They wo n’t come right . They make my head ache so . And they wo n’t do anything I want ! ’

Living in his neighbourhood , I saw him frequently ; and we all went to his house on two or three occasions to dinner or tea . The Old Soldier was in permanent quarters under the Doctor ’s roof . She was exactly the same as ever , and the same immortal butterflies hovered over her cap . Like some other mothers , whom I have known in the course of my life , Mrs. Markleham was far more fond of pleasure than her daughter was . She required a great deal of amusement , and , like a deep old soldier , pretended , in consulting her own inclinations , to be devoting herself to her child . The Doctor ’s desire that Annie should be entertained , was therefore particularly acceptable to this excellent parent ; who expressed unqualified approval of his discretion . I have no doubt , indeed , that she probed the Doctor ’s wound without knowing it . Meaning nothing but a certain matured frivolity and selfishness , not always inseparable from full - blown years , I think she confirmed him in his fear that he was a constraint upon his young wife , and that there was no congeniality of feeling between them , by so strongly commending his design of lightening the load of her life . ‘
327694	327706	327409	327409	she	488	’ she said to him one day when I was present , ‘

327746	327758	327738	327738	she	318	’ said Mrs. Markleham , with a flourish of her fan , ‘

She seldom got hold of the newspaper ( which she settled herself down in the softest chair in the house to read through an eye - glass , every day , for two hours ) , but she found out something that she was certain Annie would like to see . It was in vain for Annie to protest that she was weary of such things . Her mother ’s remonstrance always was , ‘
328323	328515	328300	328300	I	0	’ This was usually said in the Doctor ’s presence , and appeared to me to constitute Annie ’s principal inducement for withdrawing her objections when she made any . But in general she resigned herself to her mother , and went where the Old Soldier would . It rarely happened now that Mr. Maldon accompanied them . Sometimes my aunt and Dora were invited to do so , and accepted the invitation . Sometimes Dora only was asked . The time had been , when I should have been uneasy in her going ; but reflection on what had passed that former night in the Doctor ’s study , had made a change in my mistrust . I believed that the Doctor was right , and I had no worse suspicions . My aunt rubbed her nose sometimes when she happened to be alone with me , and said she could n’t make it out ; she wished they were happier ; she did n’t think our military friend ( so she always called the Old Soldier ) mended the matter at all . My aunt further expressed her opinion , ‘

329689	329772	329682	329682	I	0	’ said Mr. Dick . The sudden exultation with which he slapped me on the knee , and leaned back in his chair , with his eyebrows lifted up as high as he could possibly lift them , made me think him farther out of his wits than ever . He became as suddenly grave again , and leaning forward as before , said -- first respectfully taking out his pocket - handkerchief , as if it really did represent my aunt : ‘
329792	329793	329784	329784	she	6465	’ ‘
329804	329808	329809	329810	Fine scholar	6469	’ I replied . ‘
329812	329823	329809	329810	Fine scholar	6469	’ said Mr. Dick , touching me with his finger . ‘
329830	329831	329826	329826	HE	6465	’ ‘
329837	329841	329826	329826	HE	6465	’ I returned . ‘
329851	329900	329844	329844	I	0	’ said Mr. Dick . And he stood up before me , more exultingly than before , nodding his head , and striking himself repeatedly upon the breast , until one might have supposed that he had nearly nodded and struck all the breath out of his body . ‘
329910	329915	329916	329917	a simpleton	5235	’ said Mr. Dick , ‘
329931	329936	329928	329928	you	979	’ striking himself again , ‘
329985	330001	330002	330002	He	0	’m only Mr. Dick . And who minds Dick ? Dick ’s nobody ! Whoo ! ’
330049	330056	330057	330057	he	0	‘ Not a word , boy ! ’
330063	330120	330057	330057	he	0	‘ leave all the blame with Dick -- simple Dick -- mad Dick . I have been thinking , sir , for some time , that I was getting it , and now I have got it . After what you have said to me , I am sure I have got it . All right ! ’
330476	330496	330463	330463	her	387	‘ My goodness gracious , Annie , why did n’t you tell me there was someone in the Study ! ’
330497	330502	330503	330503	she	387	‘ My dear mama , ’
330507	330518	330503	330503	she	387	‘ how could I know that you desired the information ? ’
330519	330524	330526	330527	Mrs. Markleham	387	‘ Desired the information ! ’
330534	330546	330526	330527	Mrs. Markleham	387	‘ I never had such a turn in all my life ! ’
330547	330559	330561	330561	Annie	318	‘ Have you been to the Study , then , mama ? ’
330563	330572	330573	330573	she	387	‘ BEEN to the Study , my dear ! ’
330577	330609	330573	330573	she	387	‘ Indeed I have ! I came upon the amiable creature -- if you ’ll imagine my feelings , Miss Trotwood and David -- in the act of making his will . ’
330619	330628	330630	330631	Mrs. Markleham	387	‘ In the act , my dear Annie , ’
330652	330917	330647	330647	her	387	‘ of making his last Will and Testament . The foresight and affection of the dear ! I must tell you how it was . I really must , in justice to the darling -- for he is nothing less!--tell you how it was . Perhaps you know , Miss Trotwood , that there is never a candle lighted in this house , until one ’s eyes are literally falling out of one ’s head with being stretched to read the paper . And that there is not a chair in this house , in which a paper can be what I call , read , except one in the Study . This took me to the Study , where I saw a light . I opened the door . In company with the dear Doctor were two professional people , evidently connected with the law , and they were all three standing at the table : the darling Doctor pen in hand . “ This simply expresses then , ” said the Doctor -- Annie , my love , attend to the very words--“this simply expresses then , gentlemen , the confidence I have in Mrs. Strong , and gives her all unconditionally ? ” One of the professional people replied , “ And gives her all unconditionally . ” Upon that , with the natural feelings of a mother , I said , “ Good God , I beg your pardon ! ” fell over the door - step , and came away through the little back passage where the pantry is . ’
330939	330957	330959	330960	Mrs. Markleham	387	‘ But now is n’t it , Miss Trotwood , is n’t it , David , invigorating , ’
330969	331070	330959	330960	Mrs. Markleham	387	‘ to find a man at Doctor Strong ’s time of life , with the strength of mind to do this kind of thing ? It only shows how right I was . I said to Annie , when Doctor Strong paid a very flattering visit to myself , and made her the subject of a declaration and an offer , I said , “ My dear , there is no doubt whatever , in my opinion , with reference to a suitable provision for you , that Doctor Strong will do more than he binds himself to do . ” ’
331084	331091	331082	331083	the visitors	9493	’ feet as they went out . ‘
331100	331109	331082	331083	the visitors	9493	’ said the Old Soldier , after listening ; ‘
331173	331490	331170	331171	the Doctor	838	’ I was conscious of Mr. Dick ’s standing in the shadow of the room , shutting up his knife , when we accompanied her to the Study ; and of my aunt ’s rubbing her nose violently , by the way , as a mild vent for her intolerance of our military friend ; but who got first into the Study , or how Mrs. Markleham settled herself in a moment in her easy - chair , or how my aunt and I came to be left together near the door ( unless her eyes were quicker than mine , and she held me back ) , I have forgotten , if I ever knew . But this I know,--that we saw the Doctor before he saw us , sitting at his table , among the folio volumes in which he delighted , resting his head calmly on his hand . That , in the same moment , we saw Mrs. Strong glide in , pale and trembling . That Mr. Dick supported her on his arm . That he laid his other hand upon the Doctor ’s arm , causing him to look up with an abstracted air . That , as the Doctor moved his head , his wife dropped down on one knee at his feet , and , with her hands imploringly lifted , fixed upon his face the memorable look I had never forgotten . That at this sight Mrs. Markleham dropped the newspaper , and stared more like a figure - head intended for a ship to be called The Astonishment , than anything else I can think of . The gentleness of the Doctor ’s manner and surprise , the dignity that mingled with the supplicating attitude of his wife , the amiable concern of Mr. Dick , and the earnestness with which my aunt said to herself , ‘
331495	331522	331523	331523	Doctor	377	’ ( triumphantly expressive of the misery from which she had saved him)--I see and hear , rather than remember , as I write about it . ‘
331525	331530	331523	331523	Doctor	377	’ said Mr. Dick . ‘
331541	331542	331543	331543	Annie	318	’ ‘
331545	331550	331543	331543	Annie	318	’ cried the Doctor . ‘
331559	331560	331543	331543	Annie	318	’ ‘
331563	331567	331568	331568	I	0	’ she said . ‘
331605	331632	331633	331633	Annie	318	’ Mrs. Markleham , by this time recovering the power of speech , and seeming to swell with family pride and motherly indignation , here exclaimed , ‘
331668	331669	331670	331670	Mama	382	’ ‘
331672	331676	331670	331670	Mama	382	’ returned Annie . ‘
331698	331699	331693	331693	you	318	’ ‘
331702	331707	331708	331708	Me	0	’ exclaimed Mrs. Markleham . ‘
331730	331770	331771	331771	Annie	318	’ I was too attentive to the Doctor and his wife , to give any heed to this request ; and it made no impression on anybody else ; so Mrs. Markleham panted , stared , and fanned herself . ‘
331773	331785	331771	331771	Annie	318	’ said the Doctor , tenderly taking her in his hands . ‘
331855	331894	331851	331851	Annie	318	’ But she did not rise . After looking at him for a little while , she sank down closer to him , laid her arm across his knee , and dropping her head upon it , said : ‘
331989	332009	332010	332011	Mrs. Strong	377	’ There was a profound silence . After a few moments of painful hesitation , I broke the silence . ‘
332013	332017	332010	332011	Mrs. Strong	377	’ I said , ‘
332075	332114	332067	332067	your	377	’ She turned her face towards me for a moment , and I knew that I was right . I could not have resisted its entreaty , if the assurance that it gave me had been less convincing . ‘
332119	332123	332127	332127	your	0	’ she said , ‘
332195	332366	332181	332181	I	0	’ Thus earnestly besought , I made no reference to the Doctor for his permission , but , without any other compromise of the truth than a little softening of the coarseness of Uriah Heep , related plainly what had passed in that same room that night . The staring of Mrs. Markleham during the whole narration , and the shrill , sharp interjections with which she occasionally interrupted it , defy description . When I had finished , Annie remained , for some few moments , silent , with her head bent down , as I have described . Then , she took the Doctor ’s hand ( he was sitting in the same attitude as when we had entered the room ) , and pressed it to her breast , and kissed it . Mr. Dick softly raised her ; and she stood , when she began to speak , leaning on him , and looking down upon her husband -- from whom she never turned her eyes . ‘
332381	332393	332394	332394	I	0	’ she said in a low , submissive , tender voice , ‘
332416	332417	332420	332420	Annie	318	’ ‘
332422	332429	332420	332420	Annie	318	’ said the Doctor , mildly , ‘
332453	332454	332420	332420	Annie	318	’ ‘
332460	332469	332420	332420	Annie	318	’ she answered , in the same way , ‘
332509	332510	332420	332420	Annie	318	’ ‘
332513	332518	332420	332420	Annie	318	’ interrupted Mrs. Markleham , ‘
332526	332528	332530	332530	you	6526	’ ( ‘
332537	332566	332534	332534	you	6526	’ observed my aunt , in an indignant whisper . ) --‘I must be permitted to observe that it can not be requisite to enter into these details . ’
332567	332580	332582	332582	Annie	318	‘ No one but my husband can judge of that , mama , ’
332591	332624	332582	332582	Annie	318	‘ and he will hear me . If I say anything to give you pain , mama , forgive me . I have borne pain first , often and long , myself . ’
332625	332630	332632	332633	Mrs. Markleham	387	‘ Upon my word ! ’
332635	332642	332644	332644	Annie	318	‘ When I was very young , ’
332646	332740	332644	332644	Annie	318	‘ quite a little child , my first associations with knowledge of any kind were inseparable from a patient friend and teacher -- the friend of my dead father -- who was always dear to me . I can remember nothing that I know , without remembering him . He stored my mind with its first treasures , and stamped his character upon them all . They never could have been , I think , as good as they have been to me , if I had taken them from any other hands . ’
332741	332747	332749	332750	Mrs. Markleham	387	‘ Makes her mother nothing ! ’
332752	332757	332759	332759	Annie	318	‘ Not so mama , ’
332761	332880	332759	332759	Annie	318	‘ but I make him what he was . I must do that . As I grew up , he occupied the same place still . I was proud of his interest : deeply , fondly , gratefully attached to him . I looked up to him , I can hardly describe how -- as a father , as a guide , as one whose praise was different from all other praise , as one in whom I could have trusted and confided , if I had doubted all the world . You know , mama , how young and inexperienced I was , when you presented him before me , of a sudden , as a lover . ’
332881	332897	332899	332900	Mrs. Markleham	387	‘ I have mentioned the fact , fifty times at least , to everybody here ! ’
332903	332923	332899	332900	Mrs. Markleham	387	‘ Then hold your tongue , for the Lord ’s sake , and do n’t mention it any more ! ’
332929	332949	332951	332951	Annie	318	‘ It was so great a change : so great a loss , I felt it , at first , ’
332961	333032	332951	332951	Annie	318	‘ that I was agitated and distressed . I was but a girl ; and when so great a change came in the character in which I had so long looked up to him , I think I was sorry . But nothing could have made him what he used to be again ; and I was proud that he should think me so worthy , and we were married . ’
333033	333040	333042	333043	Mrs. Markleham	387	‘ --At Saint Alphage , Canterbury , ’
333046	333051	333042	333043	Mrs. Markleham	387	‘ Confound the woman ! ’
333056	333062	333042	333043	Mrs. Markleham	387	‘ she WON’T be quiet ! ’
333064	333069	333071	333071	Annie	318	‘ I never thought , ’
333078	333141	333071	333071	Annie	318	‘ of any worldly gain that my husband would bring to me . My young heart had no room in its homage for any such poor reference . Mama , forgive me when I say that it was you who first presented to my mind the thought that anyone could wrong me , and wrong him , by such a cruel suspicion . ’
333142	333145	333147	333148	Mrs. Markleham	387	‘ Me ! ’
333151	333160	333147	333148	Mrs. Markleham	387	‘ Ah ! You , to be sure ! ’
333165	333178	333147	333148	Mrs. Markleham	387	‘ and you ca n’t fan it away , my military friend ! ’
333180	333191	333193	333193	Annie	318	‘ It was the first unhappiness of my new life , ’
333195	333260	333193	333193	Annie	318	‘ It was the first occasion of every unhappy moment I have known . These moments have been more , of late , than I can count ; but not -- my generous husband!--not for the reason you suppose ; for in my heart there is not a thought , a recollection , or a hope , that any power could separate from you ! ’
333300	333305	333306	333306	she	318	‘ Mama is blameless , ’
333310	333469	333306	333306	she	318	‘ of having ever urged you for herself , and she is blameless in intention every way , I am sure,--but when I saw how many importunate claims were pressed upon you in my name ; how you were traded on in my name ; how generous you were , and how Mr. Wickfield , who had your welfare very much at heart , resented it ; the first sense of my exposure to the mean suspicion that my tenderness was bought -- and sold to you , of all men on earth -- fell upon me like unmerited disgrace , in which I forced you to participate . I can not tell you what it was -- mama can not imagine what it was -- to have this dread and trouble always on my mind , yet know in my own soul that on my marriage - day I crowned the love and honour of my life ! ’
333470	333479	333481	333482	Mrs. Markleham	387	‘ A specimen of the thanks one gets , ’
333487	333503	333481	333482	Mrs. Markleham	387	‘ for taking care of one ’s family ! I wish I was a Turk ! ’
333505	333522	333481	333482	Mrs. Markleham	387	‘ I wish you were , with all my heart -- and in your native country ! ’
333528	333548	333550	333550	she	387	‘ It was at that time that mama was most solicitous about my Cousin Maldon . I had liked him ’
333559	333615	333550	333550	she	387	‘ very much . We had been little lovers once . If circumstances had not happened otherwise , I might have come to persuade myself that I really loved him , and might have married him , and been most wretched . There can be no disparity in marriage like unsuitability of mind and purpose . ’
333650	333674	333757	333757	her	318	‘ There can be no disparity in marriage like unsuitability of mind and purpose’--‘no disparity in marriage like unsuitability of mind and purpose . ’
333675	333680	333682	333682	Annie	318	‘ There is nothing , ’
333684	333737	333682	333682	Annie	318	‘ that we have in common . I have long found that there is nothing . If I were thankful to my husband for no more , instead of for so much , I should be thankful to him for having saved me from the first mistaken impulse of my undisciplined heart . ’
333766	333903	333757	333757	her	318	‘ When he was waiting to be the object of your munificence , so freely bestowed for my sake , and when I was unhappy in the mercenary shape I was made to wear , I thought it would have become him better to have worked his own way on . I thought that if I had been he , I would have tried to do it , at the cost of almost any hardship . But I thought no worse of him , until the night of his departure for India . That night I knew he had a false and thankless heart . I saw a double meaning , then , in Mr. Wickfield ’s scrutiny of me . I perceived , for the first time , the dark suspicion that shadowed my life . ’
333904	333909	333911	333912	the Doctor	838	‘ Suspicion , Annie ! ’
333914	333921	333911	333912	the Doctor	838	‘ No , no , no ! ’
333922	333936	333937	333937	she	6537	‘ In your mind there was none , I know , my husband ! ’
333940	334049	333937	333937	she	6537	‘ And when I came to you , that night , to lay down all my load of shame and grief , and knew that I had to tell that , underneath your roof , one of my own kindred , to whom you had been a benefactor , for the love of me , had spoken to me words that should have found no utterance , even if I had been the weak and mercenary wretch he thought me -- my mind revolted from the taint the very tale conveyed . It died upon my lips , and from that hour till now has never passed them . ’
334082	334172	334173	334173	She	387	‘ I have never , but in your presence , interchanged a word with him from that time ; then , only when it has been necessary for the avoidance of this explanation . Years have passed since he knew , from me , what his situation here was . The kindnesses you have secretly done for his advancement , and then disclosed to me , for my surprise and pleasure , have been , you will believe , but aggravations of the unhappiness and burden of my secret . ’
334204	334348	334186	334186	his	838	‘ Do not speak to me yet ! Let me say a little more ! Right or wrong , if this were to be done again , I think I should do just the same . You never can know what it was to be devoted to you , with those old associations ; to find that anyone could be so hard as to suppose that the truth of my heart was bartered away , and to be surrounded by appearances confirming that belief . I was very young , and had no adviser . Between mama and me , in all relating to you , there was a wide division . If I shrunk into myself , hiding the disrespect I had undergone , it was because I honoured you so much , and so much wished that you should honour me ! ’
334349	334356	334358	334359	the Doctor	838	‘ Annie , my pure heart ! ’
334361	334366	334358	334359	the Doctor	838	‘ my dear girl ! ’
334367	334491	334186	334186	his	838	‘ A little more ! a very few words more ! I used to think there were so many whom you might have married , who would not have brought such charge and trouble on you , and who would have made your home a worthier home . I used to be afraid that I had better have remained your pupil , and almost your child . I used to fear that I was so unsuited to your learning and wisdom . If all this made me shrink within myself ( as indeed it did ) , when I had that to tell , it was still because I honoured you so much , and hoped that you might one day honour me . ’
334492	334503	334505	334506	the Doctor	838	‘ That day has shone this long time , Annie , ’
334508	334520	334505	334506	the Doctor	838	‘ and can have but one long night , my dear . ’
334521	334735	334736	334736	She	6541	‘ Another word ! I afterwards meant -- steadfastly meant , and purposed to myself -- to bear the whole weight of knowing the unworthiness of one to whom you had been so good . And now a last word , dearest and best of friends ! The cause of the late change in you , which I have seen with so much pain and sorrow , and have sometimes referred to my old apprehension -- at other times to lingering suppositions nearer to the truth -- has been made clear tonight ; and by an accident I have also come to know , tonight , the full measure of your noble trust in me , even under that mistake . I do not hope that any love and duty I may render in return , will ever make me worthy of your priceless confidence ; but with all this knowledge fresh upon me , I can lift my eyes to this dear face , revered as a father ’s , loved as a husband ’s , sacred to me in my childhood as a friend ’s , and solemnly declare that in my lightest thought I have never wronged you ; never wavered in the love and the fidelity I owe you ! ’
334765	334846	334747	334747	he	838	‘ Oh , hold me to your heart , my husband ! Never cast me out ! Do not think or speak of disparity between us , for there is none , except in all my many imperfections . Every succeeding year I have known this better , as I have esteemed you more and more . Oh , take me to your heart , my husband , for my love was founded on a rock , and it endures ! ’
334926	334936	334938	334939	my aunt	731	‘ You are a very remarkable man , Dick ! ’
334948	334962	334938	334939	my aunt	731	‘ and never pretend to be anything else , for I know better ! ’
334993	335007	335009	335010	my aunt	731	‘ That ’s a settler for our military friend , at any rate , ’
335017	335036	335009	335010	my aunt	731	‘ I should sleep the better for that , if there was nothing else to be glad of ! ’
335037	335047	335049	335050	Mr. Dick	363	‘ She was quite overcome , I am afraid , ’

They seem to think the only return that can be made them for bringing an unfortunate young woman into the world -- God bless my soul , as if she asked to be brought , or wanted to come!--is full liberty to worry her out of it again . What are you thinking of , Trot ? ’

336467	336497	336464	336465	Mr. Copperfield	232	’ said she , looking over her shoulder at me with the same expression . I inclined my head , without knowing what she meant ; and she said , ‘
336501	336582	336464	336465	Mr. Copperfield	232	’ again ; and returned , followed by the respectable Mr. Littimer , who , with undiminished respectability , made me a bow , and took up his position behind her . The air of wicked grace : of triumph , in which , strange to say , there was yet something feminine and alluring : with which she reclined upon the seat between us , and looked at me , was worthy of a cruel Princess in a Legend . ‘
336585	336617	336619	336620	Mr. Copperfield	232	’ said she , imperiously , without glancing at him , and touching the old wound as it throbbed : perhaps , in this instance , with pleasure rather than pain . ‘

336666	336702	336663	336663	you	232	’ said I. Mr. Littimer , without being at all discomposed , signified by a slight obeisance , that anything that was most agreeable to us was most agreeable to him ; and began again . ‘
336760	336799	336800	336801	Mr. James	608	’ He looked at the back of the seat , as if he were addressing himself to that ; and softly played upon it with his hands , as if he were striking chords upon a dumb piano . ‘
336872	336897	336864	336864	she	10378	’ Miss Dartle put her hand upon her side . I saw him steal a glance at her , and slightly smile to himself . ‘
336946	337023	337024	337026	The young woman	10378	’ He made a short pause . Her eyes wandered restlessly over the distant prospect , and she bit her nether lip to stop that busy mouth . Taking his hands from the seat , and placing one of them within the other , as he settled himself on one leg , Mr. Littimer proceeded , with his eyes cast down , and his respectable head a little advanced , and a little on one side : ‘
337149	337191	337135	337135	I	0	’ Recalling her eyes from the distance , she looked at me again now , with her former air . Mr. Littimer , clearing his throat behind his hand with a respectable short cough , changed legs , and went on : ‘
337351	337384	337386	337386	I	0	’ He changed legs again , and wetted his lips . I was convinced that the scoundrel spoke of himself , and I saw my conviction reflected in Miss Dartle ’s face . ‘
337501	337531	337490	337490	she	10378	’ Miss Dartle , leaning back upon the seat , with a light of exultation in her face , seemed almost to caress the sounds this fellow had uttered . ‘
337548	337558	337589	337592	A more outrageous person	6607	’ said Mr. Littimer , rubbing his hands uneasily , ‘

337695	337783	337692	337692	his	979	‘ It was necessary , in short , for a time , to take away everything nigh her , that she could do herself , or anybody else , an injury with , and to shut her up close . Notwithstanding which , she got out in the night ; forced the lattice of a window , that I had nailed up myself ; dropped on a vine that was trailed below ; and never has been seen or heard of , to my knowledge , since . ’
337784	337791	337802	337802	she	418	‘ She is dead , perhaps , ’
337813	337822	337802	337802	she	418	‘ She may have drowned herself , miss , ’
337837	337954	337833	337833	himself	420	‘ It ’s very possible . Or , she may have had assistance from the boatmen , and the boatmen ’s wives and children . Being given to low company , she was very much in the habit of talking to them on the beach , Miss Dartle , and sitting by their boats . I have known her do it , when Mr. James has been away , whole days . Mr. James was far from pleased to find out , once , that she had told the children she was a boatman ’s daughter , and that in her own country , long ago , she had roamed about the beach , like them . ’
338020	338024	338051	338051	she	268	‘ Never more ! ’
338025	338038	338051	338051	she	268	‘ When it was clear that nothing could be done , Miss Dartle-- ’
338039	338050	338051	338051	she	268	‘ Did I tell you not to speak to me ? ’

Words passed between us in consequence , and I felt it due to my character to leave him . I could bear , and I have borne , a great deal from Mr. James ; but he insulted me too far . He hurt me . Knowing the unfortunate difference between himself and his mother , and what her anxiety of mind was likely to be , I took the liberty of coming home to England , and relating-- ’

338578	338648	338564	338564	he	420	‘ my answer must be qualified ; because , to betray Mr. James ’s confidence to his mother , and to betray it to you , are two different actions . It is not probable , I consider , that Mr. James would encourage the receipt of letters likely to increase low spirits and unpleasantness ; but further than that , sir , I should wish to avoid going . ’
338649	338654	338656	338657	Miss Dartle	418	‘ Is that all ? ’
338671	338674	338675	338675	I	0	‘ Except , ’

But this is of no interest to you . Between these two proud persons , mother and son , there is a wider breach than before , and little hope of its healing , for they are one at heart , and time makes each more obstinate and imperious . Neither is this of any interest to you ; but it introduces what I wish to say . This devil whom you make an angel of . I mean this low girl whom he picked out of the tide - mud , ’

339665	340125	340126	340127	Mas’r Davy	256	’ I took the hand she held out with a dignified , unbending air , and it was as calm in mine as if her breast had been at peace . Her pride could still its very pulses , it appeared , and draw the placid veil before her face , through which she sat looking straight before her on the far distance . As I moved away from them along the terrace , I could not help observing how steadily they both sat gazing on the prospect , and how it thickened and closed around them . Here and there , some early lamps were seen to twinkle in the distant city ; and in the eastern quarter of the sky the lurid light still hovered . But , from the greater part of the broad valley interposed , a mist was rising like a sea , which , mingling with the darkness , made it seem as if the gathering waters would encompass them . I have reason to remember this , and think of it with awe ; for before I looked upon those two again , a stormy sea had risen to their feet . Reflecting on what had been thus told me , I felt it right that it should be communicated to Mr. Peggotty . On the following evening I went into London in quest of him . He was always wandering about from place to place , with his one object of recovering his niece before him ; but was more in London than elsewhere . Often and often , now , had I seen him in the dead of night passing along the streets , searching , among the few who loitered out of doors at those untimely hours , for what he dreaded to find . He kept a lodging over the little chandler ’s shop in Hungerford Market , which I have had occasion to mention more than once , and from which he first went forth upon his errand of mercy . Hither I directed my walk . On making inquiry for him , I learned from the people of the house that he had not gone out yet , and I should find him in his room upstairs . He was sitting reading by a window in which he kept a few plants . The room was very neat and orderly . I saw in a moment that it was always kept prepared for her reception , and that he never went out but he thought it possible he might bring her home . He had not heard my tap at the door , and only raised his eyes when I laid my hand upon his shoulder . ‘
340145	340151	340163	340163	he	979	’re kindly welcome , sir ! ’

340211	340228	340204	340204	he	979	‘ It gives no clue to where she is ; but she is not with him . ’
340363	340376	340377	340377	he	979	‘ How do you fare to feel about it , Mas’r Davy ? ’
340382	340390	340391	340391	I	0	‘ I think that she is living , ’
340394	340431	340391	340391	I	0	‘ I doen’t know . Maybe the first shock was too rough , and in the wildness of her art-- ! That there blue water as she used to speak on . Could she have thowt o ’

Without appearing to observe what he was doing , I saw how carefully he adjusted the little room , put a candle ready and the means of lighting it , arranged the bed , and finally took out of a drawer one of her dresses ( I remember to have seen her wear it ) , neatly folded with some other garments , and a bonnet , which he placed upon a chair . He made no allusion to these clothes , neither did I. There they had been waiting for her , many and many a night , no doubt . ‘
341228	341237	341225	341226	Mas’r Davy	256	’ he said , as we came downstairs , ‘

My dear Dora , unless we learn to do our duty to those whom we employ , they will never learn to do their duty to us . I am afraid we present opportunities to people to do wrong , that never ought to be presented . Even if we were as lax as we are , in all our arrangements , by choice -- which we are not -- even if we liked it , and found it agreeable to be so -- which we don’t -- I am persuaded we should have no right to go on in this way . We are positively corrupting people . We are bound to think of that . I ca n’t help thinking of it , Dora . It is a reflection I am unable to dismiss , and it sometimes makes me very uneasy .

The more my aunt looked at him , the more he reproached her ; for she had lately taken to spectacles , and for some inscrutable reason he considered the glasses personal . Dora made him lie down by her , with a good deal of persuasion ; and when he was quiet , drew one of his long ears through and through her hand , repeating thoughtfully , ‘

352991	353030	353034	353034	she	8511	’ My pretty Dora ! When she came down to dinner on the ensuing Sunday , and was so glad to see old Traddles ( who always dined with us on Sunday ) , we thought she would be ‘
353038	353344	353034	353034	she	8511	’ , in a few days . But they said , wait a few days more ; and then , wait a few days more ; and still she neither ran nor walked . She looked very pretty , and was very merry ; but the little feet that used to be so nimble when they danced round Jip , were dull and motionless . I began to carry her downstairs every morning , and upstairs every night . She would clasp me round the neck and laugh , the while , as if I did it for a wager . Jip would bark and caper round us , and go on before , and look back on the landing , breathing short , to see that we were coming . My aunt , the best and most cheerful of nurses , would trudge after us , a moving mass of shawls and pillows . Mr. Dick would not have relinquished his post of candle - bearer to anyone alive . Traddles would be often at the bottom of the staircase , looking on , and taking charge of sportive messages from Dora to the dearest girl in the world . We made quite a gay procession of it , and my child - wife was the gayest there . But , sometimes , when I took her up , and felt that she was lighter in my arms , a dead blank feeling came upon me , as if I were approaching to some frozen region yet unseen , that numbed my life . I avoided the recognition of this feeling by any name , or by any communing with myself ; until one night , when it was very strong upon me , and my aunt had left her with a parting cry of ‘
353351	353424	353348	353349	Little Blossom	592	’ I sat down at my desk alone , and tried to think , Oh what a fatal name it was , and how the blossom withered in its bloom upon the tree ! CHAPTER 49 . I AM INVOLVED IN MYSTERY I received one morning by the post , the following letter , dated Canterbury , and addressed to me at Doctor ’s Commons ; which I read with some surprise : ‘
353429	353604	353425	353426	MY DEAR	854	‘ Circumstances beyond my individual control have , for a considerable lapse of time , effected a severance of that intimacy which , in the limited opportunities conceded to me in the midst of my professional duties , of contemplating the scenes and events of the past , tinged by the prismatic hues of memory , has ever afforded me , as it ever must continue to afford , gratifying emotions of no common description . This fact , my dear sir , combined with the distinguished elevation to which your talents have raised you , deters me from presuming to aspire to the liberty of addressing the companion of my youth , by the familiar appellation of Copperfield ! It is sufficient to know that the name to which I do myself the honour to refer , will ever be treasured among the muniments of our house ( I allude to the archives connected with our former lodgers , preserved by Mrs. Micawber ) , with sentiments of personal esteem amounting to affection . ‘
353687	353771	353678	353678	he	6874	‘ If your more important avocations should admit of your ever tracing these imperfect characters thus far -- which may be , or may not be , as circumstances arise -- you will naturally inquire by what object am I influenced , then , in inditing the present missive ? Allow me to say that I fully defer to the reasonable character of that inquiry , and proceed to develop it ; premising that it is not an object of a pecuniary nature . ‘
353899	354038	354039	354039	I	0	‘ Placed in a mental position of peculiar painfulness , beyond the assuaging reach even of Mrs. Micawber ’s influence , though exercised in the tripartite character of woman , wife , and mother , it is my intention to fly from myself for a short period , and devote a respite of eight - and - forty hours to revisiting some metropolitan scenes of past enjoyment . Among other havens of domestic tranquillity and peace of mind , my feet will naturally tend towards the King ’s Bench Prison . In stating that I shall be ( D. V. ) on the outside of the south wall of that place of incarceration on civil process , the day after tomorrow , at seven in the evening , precisely , my object in this epistolary communication is accomplished . ‘
354124	354127	354154	354155	Mrs. Micawber	342	‘ Remain , ‘
354129	354131	354154	354155	Mrs. Micawber	342	‘ A ‘
354135	354139	354154	354155	Mrs. Micawber	342	‘ WILKINS MICAWBER . ‘
354165	354262	354154	354155	Mrs. Micawber	342	’ I read the letter over several times . Making due allowance for Mr. Micawber ’s lofty style of composition , and for the extraordinary relish with which he sat down and wrote long letters on all possible and impossible occasions , I still believed that something important lay hidden at the bottom of this roundabout communication . I put it down , to think about it ; and took it up again , to read it once more ; and was still pursuing it , when Traddles found me in the height of my perplexity . ‘
354267	354271	354154	354155	Mrs. Micawber	342	’ said I , ‘
354312	354313	354309	354310	Mr. Micawber	341	’ ‘

354336	354405	354333	354334	Mrs. Micawber	342	’ With that , Traddles , who was flushed with walking , and whose hair , under the combined effects of exercise and excitement , stood on end as if he saw a cheerful ghost , produced his letter and made an exchange with me . I watched him into the heart of Mr. Micawber ’s letter , and returned the elevation of eyebrows with which he said “ ‘
354438	354504	354422	354422	Copperfield!’--and	612	‘ My best regards to Mr. Thomas Traddles , and if he should still remember one who formerly had the happiness of being well acquainted with him , may I beg a few moments of his leisure time ? I assure Mr. T. T. that I would not intrude upon his kindness , were I in any other position than on the confines of distraction . ‘
354693	354710	354711	354711	I	0	‘ lemon - stunners’--a local sweetmeat -- he presented an oyster - knife at the twins ! ‘
354747	354785	354728	354729	Mr. T.	613	‘ May I now venture to confide to Mr. T. the purport of my letter ? Will he now allow me to throw myself on his friendly consideration ? Oh yes , for I know his heart ! ‘
354917	355033	355034	355036	Mr. Thomas Traddles	306	‘ If Mr. Copperfield should yet remember one unknown to fame , will Mr. T. take charge of my unalterable regards and similar entreaties ? In any case , he will have the benevolence to consider this communication strictly private , and on no account whatever to be alluded to , however distantly , in the presence of Mr. Micawber . If Mr. T. should ever reply to it ( which I can not but feel to be most improbable ) , a letter addressed to M. E. , Post Office , Canterbury , will be fraught with less painful consequences than any addressed immediately to one , who subscribes herself , in extreme distress , ‘

355096	355106	355108	355108	Traddles	306	‘ I think that the two together , Copperfield , ’
355110	355152	355153	355153	he	306	‘ mean more than Mr. and Mrs. Micawber usually mean in their correspondence -- but I do n’t know what . They are both written in good faith , I have no doubt , and without any collusion . Poor thing ! ’

Allow me to offer my inquiries with reference to the physical welfare of Mrs. Copperfield in esse , and Mrs. Traddles in posse,--presuming , that is to say , that my friend Mr. Traddles is not yet united to the object of his affections , for weal and for woe . ’

Where , for the first time in many revolving years , the overwhelming pressure of pecuniary liabilities was not proclaimed , from day to day , by importune voices declining to vacate the passage ; where there was no knocker on the door for any creditor to appeal to ; where personal service of process was not required , and detainees were merely lodged at the gate ! Gentlemen , ’

359263	359267	359188	359194	the Immortal exciseman nurtured beyond the Tweed	6945	‘ WILKINS MICAWBER . ’
359273	359871	359873	359873	she	6946	’S DREAM COMES TRUE By this time , some months had passed since our interview on the bank of the river with Martha . I had never seen her since , but she had communicated with Mr. Peggotty on several occasions . Nothing had come of her zealous intervention ; nor could I infer , from what he told me , that any clue had been obtained , for a moment , to Emily ’s fate . I confess that I began to despair of her recovery , and gradually to sink deeper and deeper into the belief that she was dead . His conviction remained unchanged . So far as I know -- and I believe his honest heart was transparent to me -- he never wavered again , in his solemn certainty of finding her . His patience never tired . And , although I trembled for the agony it might one day be to him to have his strong assurance shivered at a blow , there was something so religious in it , so affectingly expressive of its anchor being in the purest depths of his fine nature , that the respect and honour in which I held him were exalted every day . His was not a lazy trustfulness that hoped , and did no more . He had been a man of sturdy action all his life , and he knew that in all things wherein he wanted help he must do his own part faithfully , and help himself . I have known him set out in the night , on a misgiving that the light might not be , by some accident , in the window of the old boat , and walk to Yarmouth . I have known him , on reading something in the newspaper that might apply to her , take up his stick , and go forth on a journey of three -- or four - score miles . He made his way by sea to Naples , and back , after hearing the narrative to which Miss Dartle had assisted me . All his journeys were ruggedly performed ; for he was always steadfast in a purpose of saving money for Emily ’s sake , when she should be found . In all this long pursuit , I never heard him repine ; I never heard him say he was fatigued , or out of heart . Dora had often seen him since our marriage , and was quite fond of him . I fancy his figure before me now , standing near her sofa , with his rough cap in his hand , and the blue eyes of my child - wife raised , with a timid wonder , to his face . Sometimes of an evening , about twilight , when he came to talk with me , I would induce him to smoke his pipe in the garden , as we slowly paced to and fro together ; and then , the picture of his deserted home , and the comfortable air it used to have in my childish eyes of an evening when the fire was burning , and the wind moaning round it , came most vividly into my mind . One evening , at this hour , he told me that he had found Martha waiting near his lodging on the preceding night when he came out , and that she had asked him not to leave London on any account , until he should have seen her again . ‘
359878	359882	359883	359883	I	0	’ I inquired . ‘
359890	359894	359885	359885	her	6946	’ he replied , ‘
359917	359918	359920	359920	she	6946	’ ‘
359931	359935	359920	359920	she	6946	’ I demanded . ‘
359941	359953	359954	359954	I	0	’ he returned , drawing his hand thoughtfully down his face . ‘
359972	360247	360248	360248	Martha	442	’ As I had long forborne to encourage him with hopes that hung on threads , I made no other comment on this information than that I supposed he would see her soon . Such speculations as it engendered within me I kept to myself , and those were faint enough . I was walking alone in the garden , one evening , about a fortnight afterwards . I remember that evening well . It was the second in Mr. Micawber ’s week of suspense . There had been rain all day , and there was a damp feeling in the air . The leaves were thick upon the trees , and heavy with wet ; but the rain had ceased , though the sky was still dark ; and the hopeful birds were singing cheerfully . As I walked to and fro in the garden , and the twilight began to close around me , their little voices were hushed ; and that peculiar silence which belongs to such an evening in the country when the lightest trees are quite still , save for the occasional droppings from their boughs , prevailed . There was a little green perspective of trellis - work and ivy at the side of our cottage , through which I could see , from the garden where I was walking , into the road before the house . I happened to turn my eyes towards this place , as I was thinking of many things ; and I saw a figure beyond , dressed in a plain cloak . It was bending eagerly towards me , and beckoning . ‘
360250	360258	360248	360248	Martha	442	’ said I , going to it . ‘
360265	360274	360260	360260	you	442	’ she inquired , in an agitated whisper . ‘
360328	360432	360324	360324	you	442	’ My answer was , to pass out at the gate immediately . She made a hasty gesture with her hand , as if to entreat my patience and my silence , and turned towards London , whence , as her dress betokened , she had come expeditiously on foot . I asked her if that were not our destination ? On her motioning Yes , with the same hasty gesture as before , I stopped an empty coach that was coming by , and we got into it . When I asked her where the coachman was to drive , she answered , ‘
361081	361086	361088	361088	Martha	442	‘ What ’s this ! ’
361094	361108	361088	361088	Martha	442	‘ She has gone into my room . I do n’t know her ! ’
361375	361387	361389	361390	Rosa Dartle	418	‘ It matters little to me her not being at home , ’
361393	361408	361389	361390	Rosa Dartle	418	‘ I know nothing of her . It is you I come to see . ’

361437	361440	361442	361443	Miss Dartle	418	‘ Yes , ’
361445	361469	361442	361443	Miss Dartle	418	‘ I have come to look at you . What ? You are not ashamed of the face that has done so much ? ’
361541	361548	361549	361549	she	418	‘ I have come to see , ’
361552	361605	361549	361549	she	418	‘ James Steerforth ’s fancy ; the girl who ran away with him , and is the town - talk of the commonest people of her native place ; the bold , flaunting , practised companion of persons like James Steerforth . I want to know what such a thing is like . ’
361668	361672	361673	361673	she	418	‘ Stay there ! ’
361676	361718	361673	361673	she	418	‘ or I ’ll proclaim you to the house , and the whole street ! If you try to evade me , I ’ll stop you , if it ’s by the hair , and raise the very stones against you ! ’
361789	361792	361794	361795	Rosa Dartle	418	‘ So ! ’
361802	361831	361794	361795	Rosa Dartle	418	‘ I see her at last ! Why , he was a poor creature to be taken by that delicate mock - modesty , and that hanging head ! ’

361887	361900	361883	361885	the other fiercely	6992	‘ what is there in common between US , do you think ! ’
361901	361907	361909	361909	Emily	268	‘ Nothing but our sex , ’
361917	361921	361923	361924	Rosa Dartle	418	‘ And that , ’
361926	361972	361923	361924	Rosa Dartle	418	‘ is so strong a claim , preferred by one so infamous , that if I had any feeling in my breast but scorn and abhorrence of you , it would freeze it up . Our sex ! You are an honour to our sex ! ’
361973	361979	361981	361981	Emily	268	‘ I have deserved this , ’
361983	362019	361981	361981	Emily	268	‘ but it ’s dreadful ! Dear , dear lady , think what I have suffered , and how I am fallen ! Oh , Martha , come back ! Oh , home , home ! ’

When it ’s all gone , you can believe , and trust , and love again , you know ! I thought you a broken toy that had lasted its time ; a worthless spangle that was tarnished , and thrown away . But , finding you true gold , a very lady , and an ill - used innocent , with a fresh heart full of love and trustfulness -- which you look like , and is quite consistent with your story!--I have something more to say .

She heerd herself a - crying out , like as if it was another person ; and cut herself on them sharp - pinted stones and rocks , and felt it no more than if she had been rock herself . Ever so fur she run , and there was fire afore her eyes , and roarings in her ears .

Sermuchser , that when Em’ly went that way , she always giv Em’ly flowers . This was her as now asked what it was that had gone so much amiss . Em’ly told her , and she -- took her home . She did indeed . She took her home , ’

Likewise the fire was afore her eyes , and the roarings in her ears ; and theer was no today , nor yesterday , nor yet tomorrow ; but everything in her life as ever had been , or as ever could be , and everything as never had been , and as never could be , was a crowding on her all at once , and nothing clear nor welcome , and yet she sang and laughed about it ! How long this lasted , I doen’t know ; but then theer come a sleep ; and in that sleep , from being a many times stronger than her own self , she fell into the weakness of the littlest child . ’

It was her belief , at first , that she was at home upon a Sunday morning ; but the vine leaves as she see at the winder , and the hills beyond , warn’t home , and contradicted of her . Then , come in her friend to watch alongside of her bed ; and then she know’d as the old boat warn’t round that next pint in the bay no more , but was fur off ; and know’d where she was , and why ; and broke out a - crying on that good young woman ’s bosom , wheer I hope her baby is a - lying now , a - cheering of her with its pretty eyes ! ’

So she went on , getting better from day to day , slow , but sure , and trying to learn the names of common things -- names as she seemed never to have heerd in all her life -- till one evening come , when she was a - setting at her window , looking at a little girl at play upon the beach . And of a sudden this child held out her hand , and said , what would be in English , “ Fisherman ’s daughter , here ’s a shell!”--for you are to unnerstand that they used at first to call her “ Pretty lady ” , as the general way in that country is , and that she had taught ‘

369334	369373	369332	369332	he	326	‘ only my limbs are rather out of sorts , and I am wheeled about . With the exception of my limbs and my breath , howsoever , I am as hearty as a man can be , I ’m

369416	369435	369332	369332	he	326	’ he inquired , following the direction of my glance , and polishing the elbow with his arm . ‘
369518	369583	369501	369501	I	0	’ I never saw such a good old fellow to make the best of a thing , and find out the enjoyment of it , as Mr. Omer . He was as radiant , as if his chair , his asthma , and the failure of his limbs , were the various branches of a great invention for enhancing the luxury of a pipe . ‘
369596	369601	369591	369591	I	0	’ said Mr. Omer , ‘

369896	369921	369891	369891	his	8584	’ His supreme contempt for his own limbs , as he sat smoking , was one of the pleasantest oddities I have ever encountered . ‘
369942	369951	369940	369940	sir	979	’ said Mr. Omer , surveying me admiringly . ‘
369985	370005	370006	370006	I	0	’ I laughingly expressed my satisfaction , but I must confess that I thought this association of ideas significant . ‘

370120	370200	370116	370116	Dear	8941	’ I changed the subject by referring to Emily . After assuring him that I did not forget how interested he had always been in her , and how kindly he had always treated her , I gave him a general account of her restoration to her uncle by the aid of Martha ; which I knew would please the old man . He listened with the utmost attention , and said , feelingly , when I had done : ‘
370245	370246	370247	370247	You	979	’ ‘
370261	370265	370247	370247	You	979	’ said I , ‘

370687	370697	370677	370677	him	7134	’ said Mr. Omer , rubbing his hands feebly , ‘
370745	370746	370747	370747	I	0	’ ‘
370755	370758	370760	370760	you	0	’ said I. ‘

370853	370870	370871	370871	she	328	’ Mr. Omer shook himself and his chair with laughter at the success of his device , ‘
370879	370892	370871	370871	she	328	’ I shook hands with him , and wished him good night . ‘
370899	370904	370871	370871	she	328	’ said Mr. Omer . ‘
370933	370944	370931	370931	Minnie	328	’ A musical little voice answered , from somewhere upstairs , ‘
370951	370972	370949	370949	grandfather	7140	’ and a pretty little girl with long , flaxen , curling hair , soon came running into the shop . ‘
370981	370990	370979	370979	sir	979	’ said Mr. Omer , fondling the child . ‘
371001	371063	370998	370999	little elephant	7143	’ The little elephant set the door of the parlour open , enabling me to see that , in these latter days , it was converted into a bedroom for Mr. Omer who could not be easily conveyed upstairs ; and then hid her pretty forehead , and tumbled her long hair , against the back of Mr. Omer ’s chair . ‘
371073	371080	371082	371082	he	7143	’ said Mr. Omer , winking , ‘
371097	371317	370998	370999	little elephant	7143	’ At this signal , the little elephant , with a dexterity that was next to marvellous in so small an animal , whisked the chair round with Mr. Omer in it , and rattled it off , pell - mell , into the parlour , without touching the door - post : Mr. Omer indescribably enjoying the performance , and looking back at me on the road as if it were the triumphant issue of his life ’s exertions . After a stroll about the town I went to Ham ’s house . Peggotty had now removed here for good ; and had let her own house to the successor of Mr. Barkis in the carrying business , who had paid her very well for the good - will , cart , and horse . I believe the very same slow horse that Mr. Barkis drove was still at work . I found them in the neat kitchen , accompanied by Mrs. Gummidge , who had been fetched from the old boat by Mr. Peggotty himself . I doubt if she could have been induced to desert her post , by anyone else . He had evidently told them all . Both Peggotty and Mrs. Gummidge had their aprons to their eyes , and Ham had just stepped out ‘
371325	371813	371814	371815	Mas’r Davy	256	’ . He presently came home , very glad to see me ; and I hope they were all the better for my being there . We spoke , with some approach to cheerfulness , of Mr. Peggotty ’s growing rich in a new country , and of the wonders he would describe in his letters . We said nothing of Emily by name , but distantly referred to her more than once . Ham was the serenest of the party . But , Peggotty told me , when she lighted me to a little chamber where the Crocodile book was lying ready for me on the table , that he always was the same . She believed ( she told me , crying ) that he was broken - hearted ; though he was as full of courage as of sweetness , and worked harder and better than any boat - builder in any yard in all that part . There were times , she said , of an evening , when he talked of their old life in the boat - house ; and then he mentioned Emily as a child . But , he never mentioned her as a woman . I thought I had read in his face that he would like to speak to me alone . I therefore resolved to put myself in his way next evening , as he came home from his work . Having settled this with myself , I fell asleep . That night , for the first time in all those many nights , the candle was taken out of the window , Mr. Peggotty swung in his old hammock in the old boat , and the wind murmured with the old sound round his head . All next day , he was occupied in disposing of his fishing - boat and tackle ; in packing up , and sending to London by waggon , such of his little domestic possessions as he thought would be useful to him ; and in parting with the rest , or bestowing them on Mrs. Gummidge . She was with him all day . As I had a sorrowful wish to see the old place once more , before it was locked up , I engaged to meet them there in the evening . But I so arranged it , as that I should meet Ham first . It was easy to come in his way , as I knew where he worked . I met him at a retired part of the sands , which I knew he would cross , and turned back with him , that he might have leisure to speak to me if he really wished . I had not mistaken the expression of his face . We had walked but a little way together , when he said , without looking at me : ‘
371822	371823	371818	371818	you	256	’ ‘
371836	371851	371818	371818	you	256	’ I softly answered . We walked a little farther , and he said : ‘
371863	371864	371856	371856	you	256	’ ‘
371875	371878	371879	371879	I	0	’ said I. ‘
371885	371889	371879	371879	I	0	’ he replied . ‘

371900	371901	371856	371856	you	256	’ ‘
371906	371912	371904	371904	Ham	236	’ said I , gently , ‘

371985	371986	371973	371973	I	0	’ ‘
371991	372005	371973	371973	I	0	’ We walked a little farther in silence , and then he spoke . ‘
372006	372013	372014	372014	Tan’t	626	’ Tan’t that I forgive her . ‘
372019	372098	372099	372099	I	0	‘ Tis more as I beg of her to forgive me , for having pressed my affections upon her . Odd times , I think that if I had n’t had her promise fur to marry me , sir , she was that trustful of me , in a friendly way , that she ’d have told me what was struggling in her mind , and would have counselled with me , and I might have saved her . ’
372104	372109	372099	372099	I	0	‘ Is that all ? ’
372110	372118	372119	372119	he	7149	‘ Theer ’s yet a something else , ’
372122	372132	372119	372119	he	7149	‘ if I can say it , Mas’r Davy . ’
372174	372204	372168	372168	himself	7149	‘ I loved her -- and I love the mem’ry of her -- too deep -- to be able to lead her to believe of my own self as I ’m

But if you , being so full of learning , Mas’r Davy , could think of anything to say as might bring her to believe I was n’t greatly hurt : still loving of her , and mourning for her : anything as might bring her to believe as I was not tired of my life , and yet was hoping fur to see her without blame , wheer the wicked cease from troubling and the weary are at rest -- anything as would ease her sorrowful mind , and yet not make her think as I could ever marry , or as ‘
372375	372399	372400	372400	I	0	’ I pressed his manly hand again , and told him I would charge myself to do this as well as I could . ‘
372405	372409	372400	372400	I	0	’ he answered . ‘
372410	372419	372423	372423	you	7154	’ Twas kind of you to meet me . ‘
372435	372481	372400	372400	I	0	’ very well , though my aunt will come to Lon’on afore they sail , and they ’ll unite once more , that I am not like to see him agen . I fare to feel sure on’t . We doen’t say so , but so ‘
372523	372531	372532	372532	I	0	’ This I also promised , faithfully . ‘
372538	372546	372532	372532	I	0	’ he said , heartily shaking hands . ‘

372750	372759	372712	372712	he	7152	’ he said , taking up the candle . ‘

372811	372841	372805	372806	Missis Gummidge	266	’ said Mr. Peggotty , looking at her , at a loss for a sufficiently approving simile . Mrs. Gummidge , leaning on her basket , made no observation . ‘
372854	372859	372861	372862	Mr. Peggotty	234	‘ long with Em’ly ! ’

373060	373070	373071	373071	I	0	‘ Does it belong to anybody in the neighbourhood ? ’

373156	373171	373154	373154	Dan’l	272	’ said Mrs. Gummidge , suddenly deserting her basket , and clinging to his arm ‘
373211	373242	373206	373206	ye	272	’ Mr. Peggotty , taken aback , looked from Mrs. Gummidge to me , and from me to Mrs. Gummidge , as if he had been awakened from a sleep . ‘
373252	373259	373250	373250	ye	272	’ cried Mrs. Gummidge , fervently . ‘
373262	373271	373250	373250	ye	272	‘ long with you , Dan’l , take me ‘

We brought the locker out , extinguished the candle , fastened the door on the outside , and left the old boat close shut up , a dark speck in the cloudy night . Next day , when we were returning to London outside the coach , Mrs. Gummidge and her basket were on the seat behind , and Mrs. Gummidge was happy . CHAPTER 52 . I ASSIST AT AN EXPLOSION When the time Mr. Micawber had appointed so mysteriously , was within four - and - twenty hours of being come , my aunt and I consulted how we should proceed ; for my aunt was very unwilling to leave Dora . Ah ! how easily I carried Dora up and down stairs , now ! We were disposed , notwithstanding Mr. Micawber ’s stipulation for my aunt ’s attendance , to arrange that she should stay at home , and be represented by Mr. Dick and me . In short , we had resolved to take this course , when Dora again unsettled us by declaring that she never would forgive herself , and never would forgive her bad boy , if my aunt remained behind , on any pretence . ‘
373839	373850	373832	373832	I	0	’ said Dora , shaking her curls at my aunt . ‘

373913	373917	373918	373918	You	7180	’ said Dora . ‘
373991	374003	373987	373987	you	7180	’ Dora made haste to kiss my aunt , and say , ‘
374010	374022	374009	374009	I	0	’m only joking!’-lest my aunt should think she really meant it . ‘
374027	374033	374009	374009	I	0	’ said Dora , coaxingly , ‘
374046	374115	374117	374117	Dora	488	‘ till you let me have my own way about it . I shall lead my naughty boy such a life , if he do n’t make you go . I shall make myself so disagreeable -- and so will Jip ! You ’ll wish you had gone , like a good thing , for ever and ever so long , if you do n’t go . Besides , ’
374133	374151	374121	374121	her	488	‘ why should n’t you both go ? I am not very ill indeed . Am I ? ’
374152	374159	374161	374162	my aunt	731	‘ Why , what a question ! ’

374267	374292	374294	374294	Dora	488	‘ You ’ll come back with so much to tell me , that it ’ll take at least a week to make me understand ! ’
374296	374436	374294	374294	Dora	488	‘ Because I know I sha n’t understand , for a length of time , if there ’s any business in it . And there ’s sure to be some business in it ! If there ’s anything to add up , besides , I do n’t know when I shall make it out ; and my bad boy will look so miserable all the time . There ! Now you ’ll go , wo n’t you ? You ’ll only be gone one night , and Jip will take care of me while you are gone . Doady will carry me upstairs before you go , and I wo n’t come down again till you come back ; and you shall take Agnes a dreadfully scolding letter from me , because she has never been to see us ! ’

375396	375405	375407	375407	Traddles	306	‘ It is undoubtedly the fact , Copperfield , ’
375416	375443	375407	375407	Traddles	306	‘ Mr. Micawber has consulted me in reference to what he has in contemplation ; and I have advised him to the best of my judgement . ’
375444	375453	375455	375456	Mr. Micawber	341	‘ Unless I deceive myself , Mr. Traddles , ’
375458	375470	375455	375456	Mr. Micawber	341	‘ what I contemplate is a disclosure of an important nature . ’
375471	375475	375477	375477	Traddles	306	‘ Highly so , ’
375479	375490	375492	375493	Mr. Micawber	341	‘ Perhaps , under such circumstances , madam and gentlemen , ’
375495	375567	375492	375493	Mr. Micawber	341	‘ you will do me the favour to submit yourselves , for the moment , to the direction of one who , however unworthy to be regarded in any other light but as a Waif and Stray upon the shore of human nature , is still your fellow - man , though crushed out of his original form by individual errors , and the accumulative force of a combination of circumstances ? ’

375601	375657	375598	375599	Mr. Micawber	341	‘ your confidence is not , at the existing juncture , ill - bestowed . I would beg to be allowed a start of five minutes by the clock ; and then to receive the present company , inquiring for Miss Wickfield , at the office of Wickfield and Heep , whose Stipendiary I am . ’
375671	375677	375668	375668	his	306	‘ I have no more , ’
375682	375688	375679	375680	Mr. Micawber	341	‘ to say at present . ’

375910	375914	375916	375917	Mr. Micawber	341	‘ Mr. Copperfield , ’
375921	375929	375916	375917	Mr. Micawber	341	‘ I hope I see you well ? ’
375930	375937	375939	375939	I.	0	‘ Is Miss Wickfield at home ? ’
375940	375955	375956	375956	he	341	‘ Mr. Wickfield is unwell in bed , sir , of a rheumatic fever , ’
375959	375984	375985	375985	He	341	‘ but Miss Wickfield , I have no doubt , will be happy to see old friends . Will you walk in , sir ? ’
376023	376039	376040	376040	I	0	‘ Miss Trotwood , Mr. David Copperfield , Mr. Thomas Traddles , and Mr. Dixon ! ’
376161	376168	376169	376169	he	341	‘ Well , I am sure , ’
376172	376272	376169	376169	he	341	‘ This is indeed an unexpected pleasure ! To have , as I may say , all friends round St. Paul ’s at once , is a treat unlooked for ! Mr. Copperfield , I hope I see you well , and -- if I may umbly express myself so -- friendly towards them as is ever your friends , whether or not . Mrs. Copperfield , sir , I hope she ’s getting on . We have been made quite uneasy by the poor accounts we have had of her state , lately , I do assure you . ’
376294	376321	376323	376323	Uriah	373	‘ Things are changed in this office , Miss Trotwood , since I was an umble clerk , and held your pony ; ai n’t they ? ’
376330	376340	376323	376323	Uriah	373	‘ But I am not changed , Miss Trotwood . ’
376341	376346	376348	376349	my aunt	731	‘ Well , sir , ’
376351	376379	376348	376349	my aunt	731	‘ to tell you the truth , I think you are pretty constant to the promise of your youth ; if that ’s any satisfaction to you . ’
376380	376387	376389	376389	Uriah	373	‘ Thank you , Miss Trotwood , ’
376397	376406	376389	376389	Uriah	373	‘ for your good opinion ! Micawber , tell ‘
376432	376439	376426	376426	she	10856	’ said Uriah , setting chairs . ‘
376448	376470	376445	376446	Mr. Heep	393	’ said Traddles , whose eye the cunning red eye accidentally caught , as it at once scrutinized and evaded us . ‘
376476	376500	376473	376474	Mr. Traddles	306	’ replied Uriah , resuming his official seat , and squeezing his bony hands , laid palm to palm between his bony knees . ‘
376605	376606	376603	376603	myself	0	’ ‘
376618	376622	376615	376616	Mr. Wickfield	372	’ returned Traddles ; ‘
376637	376706	376634	376635	Mr. Heep	393	’ There was something in the tone of this reply , which made Uriah look at the speaker again , with a very sinister and suspicious expression . But , seeing only Traddles , with his good - natured face , simple manner , and hair on end , he dismissed it as he replied , with a jerk of his whole body , but especially his throat : ‘
376780	376904	376778	376778	him	372	’ I was prevented from disclaiming the compliment ( if I should have done so , in any case ) , by the entrance of Agnes , now ushered in by Mr. Micawber . She was not quite so self - possessed as usual , I thought ; and had evidently undergone anxiety and fatigue . But her earnest cordiality , and her quiet beauty , shone with the gentler lustre for it . I saw Uriah watch her while she greeted us ; and he reminded me of an ugly and rebellious genie watching a good spirit . In the meanwhile , some slight sign passed between Mr. Micawber and Traddles ; and Traddles , unobserved except by me , went out . ‘
376911	376950	376909	376909	Micawber	341	’ said Uriah . Mr. Micawber , with his hand upon the ruler in his breast , stood erect before the door , most unmistakably contemplating one of his fellow - men , and that man his employer . ‘
376957	376961	376962	376962	Micawber	341	’ said Uriah . ‘
376974	376975	376967	376967	me	0	’ ‘
376978	376985	376967	376967	me	0	’ replied the immovable Mr. Micawber . ‘
376992	376996	376989	376989	you	341	’ said Uriah . ‘
377005	377055	376998	376998	I	0	’ replied Mr. Micawber , with a burst . Uriah ’s cheeks lost colour , and an unwholesome paleness , still faintly tinged by his pervading red , overspread them . He looked at Mr. Micawber attentively , with his whole face breathing short and quick in every feature . ‘
377068	377079	377058	377060	a dissipated fellow	7252	’ he said , with an effort at a smile , ‘
377104	377105	377097	377097	I	0	’ ‘
377115	377129	377097	377097	I	0	’ said Mr. Micawber , suddenly breaking out again with the utmost vehemence , ‘
377147	377186	377139	377140	that scoundrel	7255	’ Uriah fell back , as if he had been struck or stung . Looking slowly round upon us with the darkest and wickedest expression that his face could wear , he said , in a lower voice : ‘
377293	377294	377286	377286	I	0	’ ‘
377298	377302	377295	377296	Mr. Micawber	341	’ said I , ‘
377345	377346	377347	377347	You	7261	’ ‘
377359	377390	377349	377353	a precious set of people	7262	’ said Uriah , in the same low voice , and breaking out into a clammy heat , which he wiped from his forehead , with his long lean hand , ‘
377559	377584	377555	377557	Where ’s mother	7271	’ he said , suddenly appearing to notice , with alarm , the absence of Traddles , and pulling down the bell - rope . ‘
377594	377595	377596	377597	Mrs. Heep	392	’ ‘
377603	377617	377596	377597	Mrs. Heep	392	’ said Traddles , returning with that worthy mother of a worthy son . ‘
377630	377631	377618	377618	I	0	’ ‘
377640	377644	377634	377634	you	341	’ retorted Uriah . ‘
377652	377653	377648	377648	you	341	’ ‘
377666	377679	377664	377664	sir	979	’ said Traddles , in a composed and business - like way . ‘

377715	377724	377708	377708	himself	7278	’ said Uriah , turning uglier than before , ‘
377735	377736	377708	377708	himself	7278	’ ‘
377749	377754	377758	377758	you	341	’ returned Traddles quietly ; ‘
377777	377778	377774	377775	Mr. Micawber	341	’ ‘
377781	377791	377779	377779	Ury--	628	’ Mrs. Heep began , with an anxious gesture . ‘
377799	377803	377797	377797	mother	10856	’ he returned ; ‘
377810	377811	377797	377797	mother	10856	’ ‘
377816	377817	377814	377815	my Ury--	7281	’ ‘
377832	377934	377824	377824	mother	10856	’ Though I had long known that his servility was false , and all his pretences knavish and hollow , I had had no adequate conception of the extent of his hypocrisy , until I now saw him with his mask off . The suddenness with which he dropped it , when he perceived that it was useless to him ; the malice , insolence , and hatred , he revealed ; the leer with which he exulted , even at this moment , in the evil he had done -- all this time being desperate too , and at his wits ’
378139	378223	378124	378124	he	7284	‘ You think it justifiable , do you , Copperfield , you who pride yourself so much on your honour and all the rest of it , to sneak about my place , eaves - dropping with my clerk ? If it had been ME , I should n’t have wondered ; for I do n’t make myself out a gentleman ( though I never was in the streets either , as you were , according to Micawber ) , but being you!--And you ’re
378305	378461	378302	378302	I	0	’ Seeing that what he said had no effect on me or any of us , he sat on the edge of his table with his hands in his pockets , and one of his splay feet twisted round the other leg , waiting doggedly for what might follow . Mr. Micawber , whose impetuosity I had restrained thus far with the greatest difficulty , and who had repeatedly interposed with the first syllable of SCOUN - drel ! without getting to the second , now burst forward , drew the ruler from his breast ( apparently as a defensive weapon ) , and produced from his pocket a foolscap document , folded in the form of a large letter . Opening this packet , with his old flourish , and glancing at the contents , as if he cherished an artistic admiration of their style of composition , he began to read as follows : ‘
378469	378470	378467	378467	gentlemen--	7291	’ ‘
378477	378486	378487	378487	He	853	’ exclaimed my aunt in a low voice . ‘
378502	378513	378467	378467	gentlemen--	7291	’ Mr. Micawber , without hearing her , went on . ‘
378532	378555	378467	378467	gentlemen--	7291	’ Mr. Micawber , without looking off the letter , pointed the ruler , like a ghostly truncheon , at Uriah Heep , ‘
378618	378678	378726	378726	HEEP	373	’ The relish with which Mr. Micawber described himself as a prey to these dismal calamities , was only to be equalled by the emphasis with which he read his letter ; and the kind of homage he rendered to it with a roll of his head , when he thought he had hit a sentence very hard indeed . ‘
378765	378840	378841	378842	The Devil	10340	’ Uriah , more blue than white at these words , made a dart at the letter , as if to tear it in pieces . Mr. Micawber , with a perfect miracle of dexterity or luck , caught his advancing knuckles with the ruler , and disabled his right hand . It dropped at the wrist , as if it were broken . The blow sounded as if it had fallen on wood . ‘
378846	378858	378841	378842	The Devil	10340	’ said Uriah , writhing in a new way with pain . ‘
378866	378867	378874	378874	you	7306	’ ‘
378881	378886	378876	378876	you	7306	’ gasped Mr. Micawber , ‘
378905	378941	378874	378874	you	7306	’ I think I never saw anything more ridiculous -- I was sensible of it , even at the time -- than Mr. Micawber making broad - sword guards with the ruler , and crying , ‘
378945	379036	378874	378874	you	7306	’ while Traddles and I pushed him back into a corner , from which , as often as we got him into it , he persisted in emerging again . His enemy , muttering to himself , after wringing his wounded hand for sometime , slowly drew off his neck - kerchief and bound it up ; then held it in his other hand , and sat upon his table with his sullen face looking down . Mr. Micawber , when he was sufficiently cool , proceeded with his letter . ‘
379055	379068	378874	378874	you	7306	’ always pausing before that word and uttering it with astonishing vigour , ‘
379226	379264	379271	379271	HEEP	373	’ Mr. Micawber ’s enjoyment of his epistolary powers , in describing this unfortunate state of things , really seemed to outweigh any pain or anxiety that the reality could have caused him . He read on : ‘
379428	379469	379404	379406	the philosophic Dane	7314	’ Mr. Micawber was so very much struck by this happy rounding off with a quotation , that he indulged himself , and us , with a second reading of the sentence , under pretence of having lost his place . ‘
379478	379484	379404	379406	the philosophic Dane	7314	’ he continued reading on , ‘
379655	379681	379683	379683	My	0	’ He read this passage as if it were from an Act of Parliament ; and appeared majestically refreshed by the sound of the words . ‘
379690	379717	379683	379683	My	0	’ he read on , glancing at him , and drawing the ruler into a convenient position under his left arm , in case of need , ‘
379724	379741	379683	379683	My	0	’ We all held our breath , I think . I am sure Uriah held his . ‘
379746	379751	379683	379683	My	0	’ said Mr. Micawber , ‘
379942	379943	379944	379944	You	7320	’ ‘
379952	379964	379944	379944	You	7320	’ said Uriah , with a threatening shake of the head . ‘
379970	379971	379974	379974	HEEP	373	’ ‘
379987	379998	380000	380000	you	7320	’ said Mr. Micawber , breaking off from the letter ; ‘
380002	380003	380004	380005	The fool	7323	’ ‘
380013	380019	380006	380006	himself	7323	’ said Uriah , disdainfully . ‘
380036	380041	380043	380043	you	7320	’ said Mr. Micawber ; ‘
380045	380063	380043	380043	you	7320	’ I saw Uriah ’s lank hand stop , involuntarily , in the scraping of his chin . ‘
380068	380073	380043	380043	you	7320	’ said Mr. Micawber , ‘
380113	380144	380145	380145	Ury	631	’ The triumphant flourish with which Mr. Micawber delivered himself of these words , had a powerful effect in alarming the mother ; who cried out , in much agitation : ‘
380159	380160	380161	380161	Mother	386	’ ‘
380163	380167	380169	380169	you	386	’ he retorted , ‘
380174	380191	380192	380192	he	357	’re in a fright , and do n’t know what you say or mean . Umble ! ’
380203	380209	380192	380192	he	357	‘ I ’ve umbled some of ‘
380223	380241	380192	380192	he	357	’ Mr. Micawber , genteelly adjusting his chin in his cravat , presently proceeded with his composition . ‘
380264	380265	380245	380245	HEEP	373	’ ‘
380272	380278	380279	380279	Mother	10856	’ muttered Uriah , relieved . ‘
380285	380286	380281	380281	you	386	’ ‘
380308	380313	380303	380303	sir	979	’ replied Mr. Micawber . ‘
380382	380672	380720	380720	family,--as	7333	’ Again , Mr. Micawber had a relish in this formal piling up of words , which , however ludicrously displayed in his case , was , I must say , not at all peculiar to him . I have observed it , in the course of my life , in numbers of men . It seems to me to be a general rule . In the taking of legal oaths , for instance , deponents seem to enjoy themselves mightily when they come to several good words in succession , for the expression of one idea ; as , that they utterly detest , abominate , and abjure , or so forth ; and the old anathemas were made relishing on the same principle . We talk about the tyranny of words , but we like to tyrannize over them too ; we are fond of having a large superfluous establishment of words to wait upon us on great occasions ; we think it looks important , and sounds well . As we are not particular about the meaning of our liveries on state occasions , if they be but fine and numerous enough , so , the meaning or necessity of our words is a secondary consideration , if there be but a great parade of them . And as individuals get into trouble by making too great a show of liveries , or as slaves when they are too numerous rise against their masters , so I think I could mention a nation that has got into many great difficulties , and will get into many greater , from maintaining too large a retinue of words . Mr. Micawber read on , almost smacking his lips : ‘
380909	380955	380898	380898	I	0	’ Uriah Heep , with a start , took out of his pocket a bunch of keys , and opened a certain drawer ; then , suddenly bethought himself of what he was about , and turned again towards us , without looking in it . ‘

381123	381136	381106	381106	he	4877	‘ you had better take and fire a loaded gun at me . ’

381182	381248	381155	381155	she	392	‘ And I ca n’t bear to hear you provoking the gentlemen , and endangering of yourself more . I told the gentleman at first , when he told me upstairs it was come to light , that I would answer for your being umble , and making amends . Oh , see how umble I am , gentlemen , and do n’t mind him ! ’
381249	381258	381259	381259	he	7343	‘ Why , there ’s Copperfield , mother , ’
381293	381314	381287	381287	I	0	‘ there ’s Copperfield , would have given you a hundred pound to say less than you ’ve blurted out ! ’

381375	381401	381356	381356	He	7343	‘ What more have you got to bring forward ? If anything , go on with it . What do you look at me for ? ’

I am now in a condition to show , by -- HEEP’S -- false books , and -- HEEP’S -- real memoranda , beginning with the partially destroyed pocket - book ( which I was unable to comprehend , at the time of its accidental discovery by Mrs. Micawber , on our taking possession of our present abode , in the locker or bin devoted to the reception of the ashes calcined on our domestic hearth ) , that the weaknesses , the faults , the very virtues , the parental affections , and the sense of honour , of the unhappy Mr. W. have been for years acted on by , and warped to the base purposes of -- HEEP .

That the engrossing object of -- HEEP -- was , next to gain , to subdue Mr. and Miss W. ( of his ulterior views in reference to the latter I say nothing ) entirely to himself . That his last act , completed but a few months since , was to induce Mr. W. to execute a relinquishment of his share in the partnership , and even a bill of sale on the very furniture of his house , in consideration of a certain annuity , to be well and truly paid by -- HEEP -- on the four common quarter - days in each and every year . That these meshes ; beginning with alarming and falsified accounts of the estate of which Mr. W. is the receiver , at a period when Mr. W. had launched into imprudent and ill - judged speculations , and may not have had the money , for which he was morally and legally responsible , in hand ; going on with pretended borrowings of money at enormous interest , really coming from -- HEEP -- and by -- HEEP -- fraudulently obtained or withheld from Mr. W. himself , on pretence of such speculations or otherwise ; perpetuated by a miscellaneous catalogue of unscrupulous chicaneries -- gradually thickened , until the unhappy Mr. W. could see no world beyond . Bankrupt , as he believed , alike in circumstances , in all other hope , and in honour , his sole reliance was upon the monster in the garb of man,”’--Mr . Micawber made a good deal of this , as a new turn of expression,--‘“who , by making himself necessary to him , had achieved his destruction . All this I undertake to show . Probably much more ! ” ’
381928	381932	381921	381921	He	341	‘ Pardon me , ’
381956	382221	381921	381921	He	341	‘ “ I have now concluded . It merely remains for me to substantiate these accusations ; and then , with my ill - starred family , to disappear from the landscape on which we appear to be an encumbrance . That is soon done . It may be reasonably inferred that our baby will first expire of inanition , as being the frailest member of our circle ; and that our twins will follow next in order . So be it ! For myself , my Canterbury Pilgrimage has done much ; imprisonment on civil process , and want , will soon do more . I trust that the labour and hazard of an investigation -- of which the smallest results have been slowly pieced together , in the pressure of arduous avocations , under grinding penurious apprehensions , at rise of morn , at dewy eve , in the shadows of night , under the watchful eye of one whom it were superfluous to call Demon -- combined with the struggle of parental Poverty to turn it , when completed , to the right account , may be as the sprinkling of a few drops of sweet water on my funeral pyre . I ask no more . Let it be , in justice , merely said of me , as of a gallant and eminent naval Hero , with whom I have no pretensions to cope , that what I have done , I did , in despite of mercenary and selfish objects , For England , home , and Beauty . ‘
382237	382332	382233	382234	WILKINS MICAWBER	357	’ Much affected , but still intensely enjoying himself , Mr. Micawber folded up his letter , and handed it with a bow to my aunt , as something she might like to keep . There was , as I had noticed on my first visit long ago , an iron safe in the room . The key was in it . A hasty suspicion seemed to strike Uriah ; and , with a glance at Mr. Micawber , he went to it , and threw the doors clanking open . It was empty . ‘
382338	382347	382348	382349	Some thief	7347	’ he cried , with a frightful face . ‘

382440	382444	382429	382429	you	7348	’ answered Traddles , ‘
382447	382483	382429	382429	you	7348	’ What was my astonishment when I beheld my aunt , who had been profoundly quiet and attentive , make a dart at Uriah Heep , and seize him by the collar with both hands ! ‘

I hastened to put myself between them , and to assure her that we would all take care that he should make the utmost restitution of everything he had wrongly got . This , and a few moments ’

382812	382819	382821	382821	Uriah	373	‘ Has that Copperfield no tongue ? ’
382823	382848	382821	382821	Uriah	373	‘ I would do a good deal for you if you could tell me , without lying , that somebody had cut it out . ’
382849	382857	382859	382860	his mother	9418	‘ My Uriah means to be umble ! ’
382862	382873	382859	382860	his mother	9418	‘ Do n’t mind what he says , good gentlemen ! ’
382874	382880	382882	382882	Traddles	306	‘ What must be done , ’
382884	382911	382882	382882	Traddles	306	‘ is this . First , the deed of relinquishment , that we have heard of , must be given over to me now -- here . ’
382912	382920	382921	382921	he	306	‘ Suppose I have n’t got it , ’
382924	382929	382931	382931	Traddles	306	‘ But you have , ’
382933	382945	382931	382931	Traddles	306	‘ therefore , you know , we wo n’t suppose so . ’
382984	382987	382989	382989	Traddles	306	‘ Then , ’
382991	383049	382989	382989	Traddles	306	‘ you must prepare to disgorge all that your rapacity has become possessed of , and to make restoration to the last farthing . All the partnership books and papers must remain in our possession ; all your books and papers ; all money accounts and securities , of both kinds . In short , everything here . ’
383050	383060	383062	383062	Uriah	373	‘ Must it ? I do n’t know that , ’
383064	383074	383062	383062	Uriah	373	‘ I must have time to think about that . ’
383075	383078	383080	383080	Traddles	306	‘ Certainly , ’
383082	383130	383080	383080	Traddles	306	‘ but , in the meanwhile , and until everything is done to our satisfaction , we shall maintain possession of these things ; and beg you -- in short , compel you -- to keep to your own room , and hold no communication with anyone . ’
383131	383138	383140	383140	Uriah	373	‘ I wo n’t do it ! ’
383146	383156	383158	383158	Traddles	306	‘ Maidstone jail is a safer place of detention , ’
383160	383224	383158	383158	Traddles	306	‘ and though the law may be longer in righting us , and may not be able to right us so completely as you can , there is no doubt of its punishing YOU . Dear me , you know that quite as well as I ! Copperfield , will you go round to the Guildhall , and bring a couple of officers ? ’
383355	383358	383359	383359	he	306	‘ Stop ! ’
383373	383383	383359	383359	he	306	‘ Mother , hold your noise . Well ! Let ‘
383394	383395	383397	383397	you	306	’ ‘
383404	383408	383397	383397	you	306	’ said Traddles , ‘
383413	383480	383401	383402	Mr. Dick	363	’ Proud of his commission , and understanding it , Mr. Dick accompanied her as a shepherd ’s dog might accompany a sheep . But , Mrs. Heep gave him little trouble ; for she not only returned with the deed , but with the box in which it was , where we found a banker ’s book and some other papers that were afterwards serviceable . ‘
383483	383492	383401	383402	Mr. Dick	363	’ said Traddles , when this was brought . ‘
383551	383581	383582	383582	Copperfield	232	’ Uriah , without lifting his eyes from the ground , shuffled across the room with his hand to his chin , and pausing at the door , said : ‘
383605	383606	383598	383598	you	393	’ ‘
383616	383620	383608	383608	I	0	’ said I , ‘
383681	383682	383687	383687	they	7368	’ ‘
383748	383755	383756	383756	You	393	’ said he with a sneer . ‘
383800	383842	383791	383793	you old bully	7372	’ Mr. Micawber , supremely defiant of him and his extended finger , and making a great deal of his chest until he had slunk out at the door , then addressed himself to me , and proffered me the satisfaction of ‘
383856	383874	383854	383855	Mrs. Micawber	342	’ . After which , he invited the company generally to the contemplation of that affecting spectacle . ‘
383892	383897	383854	383855	Mrs. Micawber	342	’ said Mr. Micawber ; ‘
383917	384129	384130	384130	Emma	355	’ As we were all very grateful to him , and all desirous to show that we were , as well as the hurry and disorder of our spirits would permit , I dare say we should all have gone , but that it was necessary for Agnes to return to her father , as yet unable to bear more than the dawn of hope ; and for someone else to hold Uriah in safe keeping . So , Traddles remained for the latter purpose , to be presently relieved by Mr. Dick ; and Mr. Dick , my aunt , and I , went home with Mr. Micawber . As I parted hurriedly from the dear girl to whom I owed so much , and thought from what she had been saved , perhaps , that morning -- her better resolution notwithstanding -- I felt devoutly thankful for the miseries of my younger days which had brought me to the knowledge of Mr. Micawber . His house was not far off ; and as the street door opened into the sitting - room , and he bolted in with a precipitation quite his own , we found ourselves at once in the bosom of the family . Mr. Micawber exclaiming , ‘
384135	384221	384222	384222	Emma	355	’ rushed into Mrs. Micawber ’s arms . Mrs. Micawber shrieked , and folded Mr. Micawber in her embrace . Miss Micawber , nursing the unconscious stranger of Mrs. Micawber ’s last letter to me , was sensibly affected . The stranger leaped . The twins testified their joy by several inconvenient but innocent demonstrations . Master Micawber , whose disposition appeared to have been soured by early disappointment , and whose aspect had become morose , yielded to his better feelings , and blubbered . ‘
384224	384229	384222	384222	Emma	355	’ said Mr. Micawber . ‘
384262	384270	384130	384130	Emma	355	’ cried Mr. Micawber , shedding tears . ‘
384296	384422	384424	384424	me	0	’ With these expressions , Mr. Micawber placed Mrs. Micawber in a chair , and embraced the family all round ; welcoming a variety of bleak prospects , which appeared , to the best of my judgement , to be anything but welcome to them ; and calling upon them to come out into Canterbury and sing a chorus , as nothing else was left for their support . But Mrs. Micawber having , in the strength of her emotions , fainted away , the first thing to be done , even before the chorus could be considered complete , was to recover her . This my aunt and Mr. Micawber did ; and then my aunt was introduced , and Mrs. Micawber recognized me . ‘

384704	384825	384826	384827	Mr. Micawber	341	’ Master Micawber ’s moroseness of aspect returned upon him again , and he demanded , with some temper , what he was to do ? Whether he had been born a carpenter , or a coach - painter , any more than he had been born a bird ? Whether he could go into the next street , and open a chemist ’s shop ? Whether he could rush to the next assizes , and proclaim himself a lawyer ? Whether he could come out by force at the opera , and succeed by violence ? Whether he could do anything , without being brought up to something ? My aunt mused a little while , and then said : ‘

Shall I ever recall that street of Canterbury on a market - day , without recalling him , as he walked back with us ; expressing , in the hardy roving manner he assumed , the unsettled habits of a temporary sojourner in the land ; and looking at the bullocks , as they came by , with the eye of an Australian farmer ! CHAPTER 53 . ANOTHER RETROSPECT I must pause yet once again . O , my child - wife , there is a figure in the moving crowd before my memory , quiet and still , saying in its innocent love and childish beauty , Stop to think of me -- turn to look upon the Little Blossom , as it flutters to the ground ! I do . All else grows dim , and fades away . I am again with Dora , in our cottage . I do not know how long she has been ill . I am so used to it in feeling , that I can not count the time . It is not really long , in weeks or months ; but , in my usage and experience , it is a weary , weary while . They have left off telling me to ‘
385737	386079	386105	386105	you	7415	’ . I have begun to fear , remotely , that the day may never shine , when I shall see my child - wife running in the sunlight with her old friend Jip . He is , as it were suddenly , grown very old . It may be that he misses in his mistress , something that enlivened him and made him younger ; but he mopes , and his sight is weak , and his limbs are feeble , and my aunt is sorry that he objects to her no more , but creeps near her as he lies on Dora ’s bed -- she sitting at the bedside -- and mildly licks her hand . Dora lies smiling on us , and is beautiful , and utters no hasty or complaining word . She says that we are very good to her ; that her dear old careful boy is tiring himself out , she knows ; that my aunt has no sleep , yet is always wakeful , active , and kind . Sometimes , the little bird - like ladies come to see her ; and then we talk about our wedding - day , and all that happy time . What a strange rest and pause in my life there seems to be -- and in all life , within doors and without -- when I sit in the quiet , shaded , orderly room , with the blue eyes of my child - wife turned towards me , and her little fingers twining round my hand ! Many and many an hour I sit thus ; but , of all those times , three times come the freshest on my mind . It is morning ; and Dora , made so trim by my aunt ’s hands , shows me how her pretty hair will curl upon the pillow yet , an how long and bright it is , and how she likes to have it loosely gathered in that net she wears . ‘

She , my aunt , and I , have sat with Dora since the morning , all together . We have not talked much , but Dora has been perfectly contented and cheerful . We are now alone . Do I know , now , that my child - wife will soon leave me ? They have told me so ; they have told me nothing new to my thoughts -- but I am far from sure that I have taken that truth to heart . I can not master it . I have withdrawn by myself , many times today , to weep . I have remembered Who wept for a parting between the living and the dead . I have bethought me of all that gracious and compassionate history . I have tried to resign myself , and to console myself ; and that , I hope , I may have done imperfectly ; but what I can not firmly settle in my mind is , that the end will absolutely come . I hold her hand in mine , I hold her heart in mine , I see her love for me , alive in all its strength . I can not shut out a pale lingering shadow of belief that she will be spared . ‘

His Chinese house is by the fire ; and he lies within it , on his bed of flannel , querulously trying to sleep . The bright moon is high and clear . As I look out on the night , my tears fall fast , and my undisciplined heart is chastened heavily -- heavily . I sit down by the fire , thinking with a blind remorse of all those secret feelings I have nourished since my marriage . I think of every little trifle between me and Dora , and feel the truth , that trifles make the sum of life . Ever rising from the sea of my remembrance , is the image of the dear child as I knew her first , graced by my young love , and by her own , with every fascination wherein such love is rich . Would it , indeed , have been better if we had loved each other as a boy and a girl , and forgotten it ? Undisciplined heart , reply ! How the time wears , I know not ; until I am recalled by my child - wife ’s old companion . More restless than he was , he crawls out of his house , and looks at me , and wanders to the door , and whines to go upstairs . ‘

388643	388648	388639	388640	Mr. Micawber	341	‘ final pulverization of Heep ’

388784	388797	388774	388775	my aunt	731	‘ Pray , have you thought about that emigration proposal of mine ? ’
388798	388803	388805	388806	Mr. Micawber	341	‘ My dear madam , ’
388808	388867	388805	388806	Mr. Micawber	341	‘ perhaps I can not better express the conclusion at which Mrs. Micawber , your humble servant , and I may add our children , have jointly and severally arrived , than by borrowing the language of an illustrious poet , to reply that our Boat is on the shore , and our Bark is on the sea . ’
388868	388873	388875	388876	my aunt	731	‘ That ’s right , ’
388878	388890	388875	388876	my aunt	731	‘ I augur all sort of good from your sensible decision . ’
388891	388903	388904	388904	he	341	‘ Madam , you do us a great deal of honour , ’
388914	389035	389037	389038	Mr. Micawber	341	‘ With respect to the pecuniary assistance enabling us to launch our frail canoe on the ocean of enterprise , I have reconsidered that important business - point ; and would beg to propose my notes of hand -- drawn , it is needless to stipulate , on stamps of the amounts respectively required by the various Acts of Parliament applying to such securities -- at eighteen , twenty - four , and thirty months . The proposition I originally submitted , was twelve , eighteen , and twenty - four ; but I am apprehensive that such an arrangement might not allow sufficient time for the requisite amount of -- Something -- to turn up . We might not , ’
389056	389111	389037	389038	Mr. Micawber	341	‘ on the first responsibility becoming due , have been successful in our harvest , or we might not have got our harvest in . Labour , I believe , is sometimes difficult to obtain in that portion of our colonial possessions where it will be our lot to combat with the teeming soil . ’

389135	389240	389132	389132	he	341	‘ Mrs. Micawber and myself are deeply sensible of the very considerate kindness of our friends and patrons . What I wish is , to be perfectly business - like , and perfectly punctual . Turning over , as we are about to turn over , an entirely new leaf ; and falling back , as we are now in the act of falling back , for a Spring of no common magnitude ; it is important to my sense of self - respect , besides being an example to my son , that these arrangements should be concluded as between man and man . ’

But if a Bond , or any other description of security , would be preferred , I should be happy to execute any such instrument . As between man and man . ’
389422	389432	389434	389435	Mr. Micawber	341	‘ In reference to our domestic preparations , madam , ’
389441	389631	389434	389435	Mr. Micawber	341	‘ for meeting the destiny to which we are now understood to be self - devoted , I beg to report them . My eldest daughter attends at five every morning in a neighbouring establishment , to acquire the process -- if process it may be called -- of milking cows . My younger children are instructed to observe , as closely as circumstances will permit , the habits of the pigs and poultry maintained in the poorer parts of this city : a pursuit from which they have , on two occasions , been brought home , within an inch of being run over . I have myself directed some attention , during the past week , to the art of baking ; and my son Wilkins has issued forth with a walking - stick and driven cattle , when permitted , by the rugged hirelings who had them in charge , to render any voluntary service in that direction -- which I regret to say , for the credit of our nature , was not often ; he being generally warned , with imprecations , to desist . ’
389632	389638	389640	389641	my aunt	731	‘ All very right indeed , ’
389645	389659	389640	389641	my aunt	731	‘ Mrs. Micawber has been busy , too , I have no doubt . ’
389660	389665	389667	389668	Mrs. Micawber	342	‘ My dear madam , ’
389677	389753	389755	389756	Mrs. Micawber	342	‘ I am free to confess that I have not been actively engaged in pursuits immediately connected with cultivation or with stock , though well aware that both will claim my attention on a foreign shore . Such opportunities as I have been enabled to alienate from my domestic duties , I have devoted to corresponding at some length with my family . For I own it seems to me , my dear Mr. Copperfield , ’
389782	389839	389840	389840	I	0	‘ that the time is come when the past should be buried in oblivion ; when my family should take Mr. Micawber by the hand , and Mr. Micawber should take my family by the hand ; when the lion should lie down with the lamb , and my family be on terms with Mr. Micawber . ’
389847	389862	389840	389840	I	0	‘ This , at least , is the light , my dear Mr. Copperfield , ’
389867	389960	389840	389840	I	0	‘ in which I view the subject . When I lived at home with my papa and mama , my papa was accustomed to ask , when any point was under discussion in our limited circle , “ In what light does my Emma view the subject ? ” That my papa was too partial , I know ; still , on such a point as the frigid coldness which has ever subsisted between Mr. Micawber and my family , I necessarily have formed an opinion , delusive though it may be . ’
389961	389972	389974	389975	my aunt	731	‘ No doubt . Of course you have , ma’am , ’

389986	390048	390050	390051	Mrs. Micawber	342	‘ Now , I may be wrong in my conclusions ; it is very likely that I am , but my individual impression is , that the gulf between my family and Mr. Micawber may be traced to an apprehension , on the part of my family , that Mr. Micawber would require pecuniary accommodation . I can not help thinking , ’
390060	390109	390050	390051	Mrs. Micawber	342	‘ that there are members of my family who have been apprehensive that Mr. Micawber would solicit them for their names.---I do not mean to be conferred in Baptism upon our children , but to be inscribed on Bills of Exchange , and negotiated in the Money Market . ’
390144	390162	390137	390138	my aunt	731	‘ Well , ma’am , upon the whole , I should n’t wonder if you were right ! ’

390189	390297	390186	390187	Mrs. Micawber	342	‘ and of commencing a new career in a country where there is sufficient range for his abilities,--which , in my opinion , is exceedingly important ; Mr. Micawber ’s abilities peculiarly requiring space,--it seems to me that my family should signalize the occasion by coming forward . What I could wish to see , would be a meeting between Mr. Micawber and my family at a festive entertainment , to be given at my family ’s expense ; where Mr. Micawber ’s health and prosperity being proposed , by some leading member of my family , Mr. Micawber might have an opportunity of developing his views . ’
390298	390302	390304	390305	Mr. Micawber	341	‘ My dear , ’
390311	390371	390304	390305	Mr. Micawber	341	‘ it may be better for me to state distinctly , at once , that if I were to develop my views to that assembled group , they would possibly be found of an offensive nature : my impression being that your family are , in the aggregate , impertinent Snobs ; and , in detail , unmitigated Ruffians . ’

All I would say is , that I can go abroad without your family coming forward to favour me,--in short , with a parting Shove of their cold shoulders ; and that , upon the whole , I would rather leave England with such impetus as I possess , than derive any acceleration of it from that quarter . At the same time , my dear , if they should condescend to reply to your communications -- which our joint experience renders most improbable -- far be it from me to be a barrier to your wishes . ’

Several times she has gone out early , and been absent until evening . Last night , Traddles , with this journey before her , it was almost midnight before she came home . You know what her consideration for others is . She will not tell me what has happened to distress her . ’
390892	390931	390885	390885	she	731	‘ It ’s nothing , Trot ; it ’s nothing . There will be no more of it . You shall know by and by . Now Agnes , my dear , let us attend to these affairs . ’

390947	391087	390944	390944	Traddles	306	‘ that although he would appear not to have worked to any good account for himself , he is a most untiring man when he works for other people . I never saw such a fellow . If he always goes on in the same way , he must be , virtually , about two hundred years old , at present . The heat into which he has been continually putting himself ; and the distracted and impetuous manner in which he has been diving , day and night , among papers and books ; to say nothing of the immense number of letters he has written me between this house and Mr. Wickfield ’s , and often across the table when he has been sitting opposite , and might much more easily have spoken ; is quite extraordinary . ’
391088	391091	391093	391094	my aunt	731	‘ Letters ! ’
391096	391104	390944	390944	Traddles	306	‘ I believe he dreams in letters ! ’

391117	391194	391115	391115	Traddles	306	‘ has been doing wonders ! As soon as he was released from overlooking Uriah Heep , whom he kept in such charge as I never saw exceeded , he began to devote himself to Mr. Wickfield . And really his anxiety to be of use in the investigations we have been making , and his real usefulness in extracting , and copying , and fetching , and carrying , have been quite stimulating to us . ’
391195	391203	391205	391206	my aunt	731	‘ Dick is a very remarkable man , ’
391208	391222	391205	391206	my aunt	731	‘ and I always said he was . Trot , you know it . ’
391223	391233	391115	391115	Traddles	306	‘ I am happy to say , Miss Wickfield , ’
391247	391382	391235	391235	Traddles	306	‘ that in your absence Mr. Wickfield has considerably improved . Relieved of the incubus that had fastened upon him for so long a time , and of the dreadful apprehensions under which he had lived , he is hardly the same person . At times , even his impaired power of concentrating his memory and attention on particular points of business , has recovered itself very much ; and he has been able to assist us in making some things clear , that we should have found very difficult indeed , if not hopeless , without him . But what I have to do is to come to results ; which are short enough ; not to gossip on all the hopeful circumstances I have observed , or I shall never have done . ’
391426	391433	391435	391435	Traddles	306	‘ Now , let me see , ’
391445	391506	391435	391435	Traddles	306	‘ Having counted our funds , and reduced to order a great mass of unintentional confusion in the first place , and of wilful confusion and falsification in the second , we take it to be clear that Mr. Wickfield might now wind up his business , and his agency - trust , and exhibit no deficiency or defalcation whatever . ’
391507	391513	391515	391515	Agnes	375	‘ Oh , thank Heaven ! ’
391519	391522	391524	391524	Traddles	306	‘ But , ’
391526	391622	391524	391524	Traddles	306	‘ the surplus that would be left as his means of support -- and I suppose the house to be sold , even in saying this -- would be so small , not exceeding in all probability some hundreds of pounds , that perhaps , Miss Wickfield , it would be best to consider whether he might not retain his agency of the estate to which he has so long been receiver . His friends might advise him , you know ; now he is free . You yourself , Miss Wickfield -- Copperfield -- I-- ’
391623	391631	391633	391633	Agnes	375	‘ I have considered it , Trotwood , ’
391639	391674	391633	391633	Agnes	375	‘ and I feel that it ought not to be , and must not be ; even on the recommendation of a friend to whom I am so grateful , and owe so much . ’
391675	391685	391687	391687	Traddles	306	‘ I will not say that I recommend it , ’
391689	391701	391687	391687	Traddles	306	‘ I think it right to suggest it . No more . ’

391718	391839	391714	391714	Agnes	375	‘ for it gives me hope , almost assurance , that we think alike . Dear Mr. Traddles and dear Trotwood , papa once free with honour , what could I wish for ! I have always aspired , if I could have released him from the toils in which he was held , to render back some little portion of the love and care I owe him , and to devote my life to him . It has been , for years , the utmost height of my hopes . To take our future on myself , will be the next great happiness -- the next to his release from all trust and responsibility -- that I can know . ’
391840	391848	391687	391687	Traddles	306	‘ Have you thought how , Agnes ? ’
391849	391915	391920	391920	her	7491	‘ Often ! I am not afraid , dear Trotwood . I am certain of success . So many people know me here , and think kindly of me , that I am certain . Do n’t mistrust me . Our wants are not many . If I rent the dear old house , and keep a school , I shall be useful and happy . ’

392056	392066	392068	392068	Traddles	306	‘ I ca n’t account for more than five , ’

392118	392224	392104	392104	Traddles	306	‘ I sold three , myself . One , I paid for your articles , Trot , my dear ; and the other two I have by me . When I lost the rest , I thought it wise to say nothing about that sum , but to keep it secretly for a rainy day . I wanted to see how you would come out of the trial , Trot ; and you came out nobly -- persevering , self - reliant , self - denying ! So did Dick . Do n’t speak to me , for I find my nerves a little shaken ! ’
392250	392258	392260	392260	Traddles	306	‘ Then I am delighted to say , ’
392266	392275	392260	392260	Traddles	306	‘ that we have recovered the whole money ! ’
392276	392284	392286	392287	my aunt	731	‘ Do n’t congratulate me , anybody ! ’
392289	392295	392286	392287	my aunt	731	‘ How so , sir ? ’
392296	392307	392309	392309	Traddles	306	‘ You believed it had been misappropriated by Mr. Wickfield ? ’
392311	392317	392319	392320	my aunt	731	‘ Of course I did , ’
392322	392335	392319	392320	my aunt	731	‘ and was therefore easily silenced . Agnes , not a word ! ’
392336	392340	392342	392342	Traddles	306	‘ And indeed , ’
392344	392462	392342	392342	Traddles	306	‘ it was sold , by virtue of the power of management he held from you ; but I need n’t say by whom sold , or on whose actual signature . It was afterwards pretended to Mr. Wickfield , by that rascal,--and proved , too , by figures,--that he had possessed himself of the money ( on general instructions , he said ) to keep other deficiencies and difficulties from the light . Mr. Wickfield , being so weak and helpless in his hands as to pay you , afterwards , several sums of interest on a pretended principal which he knew did not exist , made himself , unhappily , a party to the fraud . ’
392463	392473	392475	392476	my aunt	731	‘ And at last took the blame upon himself , ’
392478	392559	392475	392476	my aunt	731	‘ and wrote me a mad letter , charging himself with robbery , and wrong unheard of . Upon which I paid him a visit early one morning , called for a candle , burnt the letter , and told him if he ever could right me and himself , to do it ; and if he could n’t , to keep his own counsel for his daughter ’s sake.---If anybody speaks to me , I ’ll leave the house ! ’

392586	392598	392579	392580	my aunt	731	‘ and you have really extorted the money back from him ? ’
392599	392606	392475	392476	my aunt	731	‘ Why , the fact is , ’
392610	392706	392608	392608	Traddles	306	‘ Mr. Micawber had so completely hemmed him in , and was always ready with so many new points if an old one failed , that he could not escape from us . A most remarkable circumstance is , that I really do n’t think he grasped this sum even so much for the gratification of his avarice , which was inordinate , as in the hatred he felt for Copperfield . He said so to me , plainly . He said he would even have spent as much , to baulk or injure Copperfield . ’

They went away by one of the London night coaches , and I know no more about him ; except that his malevolence to me at parting was audacious . He seemed to consider himself hardly less indebted to me , than to Mr. Micawber ; which I consider ( as I told him ) quite a compliment . ’

392864	393019	393021	393021	Traddles	306	‘ I should say he must have pocketed a good deal , in one way or other . But , I think you would find , Copperfield , if you had an opportunity of observing his course , that money would never keep that man out of mischief . He is such an incarnate hypocrite , that whatever object he pursues , he must pursue crookedly . It ’s his only compensation for the outward restraints he puts upon himself . Always creeping along the ground to some small end or other , he will always magnify every object in the way ; and consequently will hate and suspect everybody that comes , in the most innocent manner , between him and it . So the crooked courses will become crookeder , at any moment , for the least reason , or for none . It ’s only necessary to consider his history here , ’
393023	393028	393021	393021	Traddles	306	‘ to know that . ’

But for his having been so patient and persevering for so long a time , we never could have hoped to do anything worth speaking of . And I think we ought to consider that Mr. Micawber did right , for right ’s sake , when we reflect what terms he might have made with Uriah Heep himself , for his silence . ’

393374	393397	393399	393399	Traddles	306	‘ Why , Mr. Micawber has entered the transactions -- he calls them transactions -- with great form , in a book , ’

396919	399522	396913	396913	I	0	’ It was a murky confusion -- here and there blotted with a colour like the colour of the smoke from damp fuel -- of flying clouds , tossed up into most remarkable heaps , suggesting greater heights in the clouds than there were depths below them to the bottom of the deepest hollows in the earth , through which the wild moon seemed to plunge headlong , as if , in a dread disturbance of the laws of nature , she had lost her way and were frightened . There had been a wind all day ; and it was rising then , with an extraordinary great sound . In another hour it had much increased , and the sky was more overcast , and blew hard . But , as the night advanced , the clouds closing in and densely over - spreading the whole sky , then very dark , it came on to blow , harder and harder . It still increased , until our horses could scarcely face the wind . Many times , in the dark part of the night ( it was then late in September , when the nights were not short ) , the leaders turned about , or came to a dead stop ; and we were often in serious apprehension that the coach would be blown over . Sweeping gusts of rain came up before this storm , like showers of steel ; and , at those times , when there was any shelter of trees or lee walls to be got , we were fain to stop , in a sheer impossibility of continuing the struggle . When the day broke , it blew harder and harder . I had been in Yarmouth when the seamen said it blew great guns , but I had never known the like of this , or anything approaching to it . We came to Ipswich -- very late , having had to fight every inch of ground since we were ten miles out of London ; and found a cluster of people in the market - place , who had risen from their beds in the night , fearful of falling chimneys . Some of these , congregating about the inn - yard while we changed horses , told us of great sheets of lead having been ripped off a high church - tower , and flung into a by - street , which they then blocked up . Others had to tell of country people , coming in from neighbouring villages , who had seen great trees lying torn out of the earth , and whole ricks scattered about the roads and fields . Still , there was no abatement in the storm , but it blew harder . As we struggled on , nearer and nearer to the sea , from which this mighty wind was blowing dead on shore , its force became more and more terrific . Long before we saw the sea , its spray was on our lips , and showered salt rain upon us . The water was out , over miles and miles of the flat country adjacent to Yarmouth ; and every sheet and puddle lashed its banks , and had its stress of little breakers setting heavily towards us . When we came within sight of the sea , the waves on the horizon , caught at intervals above the rolling abyss , were like glimpses of another shore with towers and buildings . When at last we got into the town , the people came out to their doors , all aslant , and with streaming hair , making a wonder of the mail that had come through such a night . I put up at the old inn , and went down to look at the sea ; staggering along the street , which was strewn with sand and seaweed , and with flying blotches of sea - foam ; afraid of falling slates and tiles ; and holding by people I met , at angry corners . Coming near the beach , I saw , not only the boatmen , but half the people of the town , lurking behind buildings ; some , now and then braving the fury of the storm to look away to sea , and blown sheer out of their course in trying to get zigzag back . Joining these groups , I found bewailing women whose husbands were away in herring or oyster boats , which there was too much reason to think might have foundered before they could run in anywhere for safety . Grizzled old sailors were among the people , shaking their heads , as they looked from water to sky , and muttering to one another ; ship - owners , excited and uneasy ; children , huddling together , and peering into older faces ; even stout mariners , disturbed and anxious , levelling their glasses at the sea from behind places of shelter , as if they were surveying an enemy . The tremendous sea itself , when I could find sufficient pause to look at it , in the agitation of the blinding wind , the flying stones and sand , and the awful noise , confounded me . As the high watery walls came rolling in , and , at their highest , tumbled into surf , they looked as if the least would engulf the town . As the receding wave swept back with a hoarse roar , it seemed to scoop out deep caves in the beach , as if its purpose were to undermine the earth . When some white - headed billows thundered on , and dashed themselves to pieces before they reached the land , every fragment of the late whole seemed possessed by the full might of its wrath , rushing to be gathered to the composition of another monster . Undulating hills were changed to valleys , undulating valleys ( with a solitary storm - bird sometimes skimming through them ) were lifted up to hills ; masses of water shivered and shook the beach with a booming sound ; every shape tumultuously rolled on , as soon as made , to change its shape and place , and beat another shape and place away ; the ideal shore on the horizon , with its towers and buildings , rose and fell ; the clouds fell fast and thick ; I seemed to see a rending and upheaving of all nature . Not finding Ham among the people whom this memorable wind -- for it is still remembered down there , as the greatest ever known to blow upon that coast -- had brought together , I made my way to his house . It was shut ; and as no one answered to my knocking , I went , by back ways and by - lanes , to the yard where he worked . I learned , there , that he had gone to Lowestoft , to meet some sudden exigency of ship - repairing in which his skill was required ; but that he would be back tomorrow morning , in good time . I went back to the inn ; and when I had washed and dressed , and tried to sleep , but in vain , it was five o’clock in the afternoon . I had not sat five minutes by the coffee - room fire , when the waiter , coming to stir it , as an excuse for talking , told me that two colliers had gone down , with all hands , a few miles away ; and that some other ships had been seen labouring hard in the Roads , and trying , in great distress , to keep off shore . Mercy on them , and on all poor sailors , said he , if we had another night like the last ! I was very much depressed in spirits ; very solitary ; and felt an uneasiness in Ham ’s not being there , disproportionate to the occasion . I was seriously affected , without knowing how much , by late events ; and my long exposure to the fierce wind had confused me . There was that jumble in my thoughts and recollections , that I had lost the clear arrangement of time and distance . Thus , if I had gone out into the town , I should not have been surprised , I think , to encounter someone who I knew must be then in London . So to speak , there was in these respects a curious inattention in my mind . Yet it was busy , too , with all the remembrances the place naturally awakened ; and they were particularly distinct and vivid . In this state , the waiter ’s dismal intelligence about the ships immediately connected itself , without any effort of my volition , with my uneasiness about Ham . I was persuaded that I had an apprehension of his returning from Lowestoft by sea , and being lost . This grew so strong with me , that I resolved to go back to the yard before I took my dinner , and ask the boat - builder if he thought his attempting to return by sea at all likely ? If he gave me the least reason to think so , I would go over to Lowestoft and prevent it by bringing him with me . I hastily ordered my dinner , and went back to the yard . I was none too soon ; for the boat - builder , with a lantern in his hand , was locking the yard - gate . He quite laughed when I asked him the question , and said there was no fear ; no man in his senses , or out of them , would put off in such a gale of wind , least of all Ham Peggotty , who had been born to seafaring . So sensible of this , beforehand , that I had really felt ashamed of doing what I was nevertheless impelled to do , I went back to the inn . If such a wind could rise , I think it was rising . The howl and roar , the rattling of the doors and windows , the rumbling in the chimneys , the apparent rocking of the very house that sheltered me , and the prodigious tumult of the sea , were more fearful than in the morning . But there was now a great darkness besides ; and that invested the storm with new terrors , real and fanciful . I could not eat , I could not sit still , I could not continue steadfast to anything . Something within me , faintly answering to the storm without , tossed up the depths of my memory and made a tumult in them . Yet , in all the hurry of my thoughts , wild running with the thundering sea,--the storm , and my uneasiness regarding Ham were always in the fore - ground . My dinner went away almost untasted , and I tried to refresh myself with a glass or two of wine . In vain . I fell into a dull slumber before the fire , without losing my consciousness , either of the uproar out of doors , or of the place in which I was . Both became overshadowed by a new and indefinable horror ; and when I awoke -- or rather when I shook off the lethargy that bound me in my chair -- my whole frame thrilled with objectless and unintelligible fear . I walked to and fro , tried to read an old gazetteer , listened to the awful noises : looked at faces , scenes , and figures in the fire . At length , the steady ticking of the undisturbed clock on the wall tormented me to that degree that I resolved to go to bed . It was reassuring , on such a night , to be told that some of the inn - servants had agreed together to sit up until morning . I went to bed , exceedingly weary and heavy ; but , on my lying down , all such sensations vanished , as if by magic , and I was broad awake , with every sense refined . For hours I lay there , listening to the wind and water ; imagining , now , that I heard shrieks out at sea ; now , that I distinctly heard the firing of signal guns ; and now , the fall of houses in the town . I got up , several times , and looked out ; but could see nothing , except the reflection in the window - panes of the faint candle I had left burning , and of my own haggard face looking in at me from the black void . At length , my restlessness attained to such a pitch , that I hurried on my clothes , and went downstairs . In the large kitchen , where I dimly saw bacon and ropes of onions hanging from the beams , the watchers were clustered together , in various attitudes , about a table , purposely moved away from the great chimney , and brought near the door . A pretty girl , who had her ears stopped with her apron , and her eyes upon the door , screamed when I appeared , supposing me to be a spirit ; but the others had more presence of mind , and were glad of an addition to their company . One man , referring to the topic they had been discussing , asked me whether I thought the souls of the collier - crews who had gone down , were out in the storm ? I remained there , I dare say , two hours . Once , I opened the yard - gate , and looked into the empty street . The sand , the sea - weed , and the flakes of foam , were driving by ; and I was obliged to call for assistance before I could shut the gate again , and make it fast against the wind . There was a dark gloom in my solitary chamber , when I at length returned to it ; but I was tired now , and , getting into bed again , fell -- off a tower and down a precipice -- into the depths of sleep . I have an impression that for a long time , though I dreamed of being elsewhere and in a variety of scenes , it was always blowing in my dream . At length , I lost that feeble hold upon reality , and was engaged with two dear friends , but who they were I do n’t know , at the siege of some town in a roar of cannonading . The thunder of the cannon was so loud and incessant , that I could not hear something I much desired to hear , until I made a great exertion and awoke . It was broad day -- eight or nine o’clock ; the storm raging , in lieu of the batteries ; and someone knocking and calling at my door . ‘
399528	399532	396913	396913	I	0	’ I cried . ‘
399539	399552	396913	396913	I	0	’ I sprung out of bed , and asked , what wreck ? ‘
399596	400677	399588	399588	she	7601	’ The excited voice went clamouring along the staircase ; and I wrapped myself in my clothes as quickly as I could , and ran into the street . Numbers of people were there before me , all running in one direction , to the beach . I ran the same way , outstripping a good many , and soon came facing the wild sea . The wind might by this time have lulled a little , though not more sensibly than if the cannonading I had dreamed of , had been diminished by the silencing of half - a - dozen guns out of hundreds . But the sea , having upon it the additional agitation of the whole night , was infinitely more terrific than when I had seen it last . Every appearance it had then presented , bore the expression of being swelled ; and the height to which the breakers rose , and , looking over one another , bore one another down , and rolled in , in interminable hosts , was most appalling . In the difficulty of hearing anything but wind and waves , and in the crowd , and the unspeakable confusion , and my first breathless efforts to stand against the weather , I was so confused that I looked out to sea for the wreck , and saw nothing but the foaming heads of the great waves . A half - dressed boatman , standing next me , pointed with his bare arm ( a tattoo’d arrow on it , pointing in the same direction ) to the left . Then , O great Heaven , I saw it , close in upon us ! One mast was broken short off , six or eight feet from the deck , and lay over the side , entangled in a maze of sail and rigging ; and all that ruin , as the ship rolled and beat -- which she did without a moment ’s pause , and with a violence quite inconceivable -- beat the side as if it would stave it in . Some efforts were even then being made , to cut this portion of the wreck away ; for , as the ship , which was broadside on , turned towards us in her rolling , I plainly descried her people at work with axes , especially one active figure with long curling hair , conspicuous among the rest . But a great cry , which was audible even above the wind and water , rose from the shore at this moment ; the sea , sweeping over the rolling wreck , made a clean breach , and carried men , spars , casks , planks , bulwarks , heaps of such toys , into the boiling surge . The second mast was yet standing , with the rags of a rent sail , and a wild confusion of broken cordage flapping to and fro . The ship had struck once , the same boatman hoarsely said in my ear , and then lifted in and struck again . I understood him to add that she was parting amidships , and I could readily suppose so , for the rolling and beating were too tremendous for any human work to suffer long . As he spoke , there was another great cry of pity from the beach ; four men arose with the wreck out of the deep , clinging to the rigging of the remaining mast ; uppermost , the active figure with the curling hair . There was a bell on board ; and as the ship rolled and dashed , like a desperate creature driven mad , now showing us the whole sweep of her deck , as she turned on her beam - ends towards the shore , now nothing but her keel , as she sprung wildly over and turned towards the sea , the bell rang ; and its sound , the knell of those unhappy men , was borne towards us on the wind . Again we lost her , and again she rose . Two men were gone . The agony on the shore increased . Men groaned , and clasped their hands ; women shrieked , and turned away their faces . Some ran wildly up and down along the beach , crying for help where no help could be . I found myself one of these , frantically imploring a knot of sailors whom I knew , not to let those two lost creatures perish before our eyes . They were making out to me , in an agitated way -- I do n’t know how , for the little I could hear I was scarcely composed enough to understand -- that the lifeboat had been bravely manned an hour ago , and could do nothing ; and that as no man would be so desperate as to attempt to wade off with a rope , and establish a communication with the shore , there was nothing left to try ; when I noticed that some new sensation moved the people on the beach , and saw them part , and Ham come breaking through them to the front . I ran to him -- as well as I know , to repeat my appeal for help . But , distracted though I was , by a sight so new to me and terrible , the determination in his face , and his look out to sea -- exactly the same look as I remembered in connexion with the morning after Emily ’s flight -- awoke me to a knowledge of his danger . I held him back with both arms ; and implored the men with whom I had been speaking , not to listen to him , not to do murder , not to let him stir from off that sand ! Another cry arose on shore ; and looking to the wreck , we saw the cruel sail , with blow on blow , beat off the lower of the two men , and fly up in triumph round the active figure left alone upon the mast . Against such a sight , and against such determination as that of the calmly desperate man who was already accustomed to lead half the people present , I might as hopefully have entreated the wind . ‘

When he grew weary , I grew weary . As his fancy died out , I would no more have tried to strengthen any power I had , than I would have married him on his being forced to take me for his wife . We fell away from one another without a word . Perhaps you saw it , and were not sorry . Since then , I have been a mere disfigured piece of furniture between you both ; having no eyes , no ears , no feelings , no remembrances . Moan ? Moan for what you made him ; not for your love .

I could not but observe that he had been peeling the lemons with his own clasp - knife , which , as became the knife of a practical settler , was about a foot long ; and which he wiped , not wholly without ostentation , on the sleeve of his coat . Mrs. Micawber and the two elder members of the family I now found to be provided with similar formidable instruments , while every child had its own wooden spoon attached to its body by a strong line . In a similar anticipation of life afloat , and in the Bush , Mr. Micawber , instead of helping Mrs. Micawber and his eldest son and daughter to punch , in wine - glasses , which he might easily have done , for there was a shelf - full in the room , served it out to them in a series of villainous little tin pots ; and I never saw him enjoy anything so much as drinking out of his own particular pint pot , and putting it in his pocket at the close of the evening . ‘

406152	406163	406167	406171	a member of my family	7756	’ said Mrs. Micawber , setting down her tin pot , ‘
406173	406174	406167	406171	a member of my family	7756	’ ‘
406181	406196	406167	406171	a member of my family	7756	’ observed Mr. Micawber , with his usual suddenness of warmth on that subject , ‘
406233	406234	406235	406235	Micawber	342	’ ‘
406237	406247	406235	406235	Micawber	342	’ said his wife , in a low tone , ‘
406254	406255	406293	406293	Micawber	342	’ ‘
406263	406270	406293	406293	Micawber	342	’ said Mr. Micawber , rising , ‘
406288	406289	406282	406282	Emma	355	’ ‘
406295	406300	406282	406282	Emma	355	’ observed his wife , ‘
406350	406351	406352	406353	My dear	854	’ ‘
406355	406359	406352	406353	My dear	854	’ he returned , ‘

406377	406382	406383	406383	Emma	355	’ said his wife . ‘
406385	406389	406383	406383	Emma	355	’ he returned , ‘
406444	406506	406509	406509	Micawber	342	’ Mr. Micawber withdrew , and was absent some little time ; in the course of which Mrs. Micawber was not wholly free from an apprehension that words might have arisen between him and the Member . At length the same boy reappeared , and presented me with a note written in pencil , and headed , in a legal manner , ‘
406510	406525	406536	406536	he	0	’ . From this document , I learned that Mr. Micawber being again arrested , ‘
406792	406807	406790	406790	he	0	‘ the principal amount of forty - one , ten , eleven and a half ’
406905	406912	406914	406915	Mrs. Micawber	342	‘ I have still a presentiment , ’
406922	406936	406919	406919	her	342	‘ that my family will appear on board , before we finally depart . ’
406960	406978	406980	406981	my aunt	731	‘ If you have any opportunity of sending letters home , on your passage , Mrs. Micawber , ’
406983	406995	406980	406981	my aunt	731	‘ you must let us hear from you , you know . ’
406996	407002	407003	407003	she	731	‘ My dear Miss Trotwood , ’
407006	407065	407003	407003	she	731	‘ I shall only be too happy to think that anyone expects to hear from us . I shall not fail to correspond . Mr. Copperfield , I trust , as an old and familiar friend , will not object to receive occasional intelligence , himself , from one who knew him when the twins were yet unconscious ? ’
407083	407094	407096	407097	Mr. Micawber	341	‘ Please Heaven , there will be many such opportunities , ’
407099	407132	407134	407135	Mr. Micawber	341	‘ The ocean , in these times , is a perfect fleet of ships ; and we can hardly fail to encounter many , in running over . It is merely crossing , ’
407144	407154	407134	407135	Mr. Micawber	341	‘ merely crossing . The distance is quite imaginary . ’
407222	407231	407233	407234	Mr. Micawber	341	‘ On the voyage , I shall endeavour , ’
407236	407337	407339	407340	Mr. Micawber	341	‘ occasionally to spin them a yarn ; and the melody of my son Wilkins will , I trust , be acceptable at the galley - fire . When Mrs. Micawber has her sea - legs on -- an expression in which I hope there is no conventional impropriety -- she will give them , I dare say , “ Little Tafflin ” . Porpoises and dolphins , I believe , will be frequently observed athwart our Bows ; and , either on the starboard or the larboard quarter , objects of interest will be continually descried . In short , ’
407348	407388	407339	407340	Mr. Micawber	341	‘ the probability is , all will be found so exciting , alow and aloft , that when the lookout , stationed in the main - top , cries Land - oh ! we shall be very considerably astonished ! ’
407424	407435	407437	407438	Mrs. Micawber	342	‘ What I chiefly hope , my dear Mr. Copperfield , ’
407440	407487	407489	407490	Mrs. Micawber	342	‘ is , that in some branches of our family we may live again in the old country . Do not frown , Micawber ! I do not now refer to my own family , but to our children ’s children . However vigorous the sapling , ’
407496	407531	407493	407493	her	342	‘ I can not forget the parent - tree ; and when our race attains to eminence and fortune , I own I should wish that fortune to flow into the coffers of Britannia . ’
407532	407536	407538	407539	Mr. Micawber	341	‘ My dear , ’
407541	407573	407538	407539	Mr. Micawber	341	‘ Britannia must take her chance . I am bound to say that she has never done much for me , and that I have no particular wish upon the subject . ’
407574	407577	407579	407580	Mrs. Micawber	342	‘ Micawber , ’
407582	407615	407579	407580	Mrs. Micawber	342	‘ there , you are wrong . You are going out , Micawber , to this distant clime , to strengthen , not to weaken , the connexion between yourself and Albion . ’
407616	407625	407627	407628	Mr. Micawber	341	‘ The connexion in question , my love , ’
407630	407660	407627	407628	Mr. Micawber	341	‘ has not laid me , I repeat , under that load of personal obligation , that I am at all sensitive as to the formation of another connexion . ’
407661	407664	407666	407667	Mrs. Micawber	342	‘ Micawber , ’
407669	407713	407666	407667	Mrs. Micawber	342	‘ There , I again say , you are wrong . You do not know your power , Micawber . It is that which will strengthen , even in this step you are about to take , the connexion between yourself and Albion . ’
407749	407755	407757	407758	Mrs. Micawber	342	‘ My dear Mr. Copperfield , ’
407760	407894	407757	407758	Mrs. Micawber	342	‘ I wish Mr. Micawber to feel his position . It appears to me highly important that Mr. Micawber should , from the hour of his embarkation , feel his position . Your old knowledge of me , my dear Mr. Copperfield , will have told you that I have not the sanguine disposition of Mr. Micawber . My disposition is , if I may say so , eminently practical . I know that this is a long voyage . I know that it will involve many privations and inconveniences . I can not shut my eyes to those facts . But I also know what Mr. Micawber is . I know the latent power of Mr. Micawber . And therefore I consider it vitally important that Mr. Micawber should feel his position . ’
407895	407899	407900	407900	he	7790	‘ My love , ’
407903	407927	407900	407900	he	7790	‘ perhaps you will allow me to remark that it is barely possible that I DO feel my position at the present moment . ’
407928	407935	407936	407936	she	7791	‘ I think not , Micawber , ’
407939	408035	407936	407936	she	7791	‘ Not fully . My dear Mr. Copperfield , Mr. Micawber ’s is not a common case . Mr. Micawber is going to a distant country expressly in order that he may be fully understood and appreciated for the first time . I wish Mr. Micawber to take his stand upon that vessel ’s prow , and firmly say , “ This country I am come to conquer ! Have you honours ? Have you riches ? Have you posts of profitable pecuniary emolument ? Let them be brought forward . They are mine ! ” ’
408056	408068	408070	408071	Mrs. Micawber	342	‘ I wish Mr. Micawber , if I make myself understood , ’
408078	408161	408074	408074	her	342	‘ to be the Caesar of his own fortunes . That , my dear Mr. Copperfield , appears to me to be his true position . From the first moment of this voyage , I wish Mr. Micawber to stand upon that vessel ’s prow and say , “ Enough of delay : enough of disappointment : enough of limited means . That was in the old country . This is the new . Produce your reparation . Bring it forward ! ” ’
408184	408189	408191	408192	Mrs. Micawber	342	‘ And doing that , ’
408194	408299	408191	408192	Mrs. Micawber	342	‘ --feeling his position -- am I not right in saying that Mr. Micawber will strengthen , and not weaken , his connexion with Britain ? An important public character arising in that hemisphere , shall I be told that its influence will not be felt at home ? Can I be so weak as to imagine that Mr. Micawber , wielding the rod of talent and of power in Australia , will be nothing in England ? I am but a woman ; but I should be unworthy of myself and of my papa , if I were guilty of such absurd weakness . ’
408328	408334	408336	408337	Mrs. Micawber	342	‘ And therefore it is , ’
408339	408410	408336	408337	Mrs. Micawber	342	‘ that I the more wish , that , at a future period , we may live again on the parent soil . Mr. Micawber may be -- I can not disguise from myself that the probability is , Mr. Micawber will be -- a page of History ; and he ought then to be represented in the country which gave him birth , and did NOT give him employment ! ’
408411	408415	408417	408418	Mr. Micawber	341	‘ My love , ’
408420	408474	408417	408418	Mr. Micawber	341	‘ it is impossible for me not to be touched by your affection . I am always willing to defer to your good sense . What will be -- will be . Heaven forbid that I should grudge my native country any portion of the wealth that may be accumulated by our descendants ! ’
408475	408480	408482	408483	my aunt	731	‘ That ’s well , ’
408490	408508	408487	408488	Mr. Peggotty	234	‘ and I drink my love to you all , and every blessing and success attend you ! ’
409233	409377	409384	409385	Mas’r Davy	256	‘ tween decks . As my eye glanced round this place , I thought I saw sitting , by an open port , with one of the Micawber children near her , a figure like Emily ’s ; it first attracted my attention , by another figure parting from it with a kiss ; and as it glided calmly away through the disorder , reminding me of -- Agnes ! But in the rapid motion and confusion , and in the unsettlement of my own thoughts , I lost it again ; and only knew that the time was come when all visitors were being warned to leave the ship ; that my nurse was crying on a chest beside me ; and that Mrs. Gummidge , assisted by some younger stooping woman in black , was busily arranging Mr. Peggotty ’s goods . ‘
409387	409391	409384	409385	Mas’r Davy	256	’ said he . ‘
409402	409403	409384	409385	Mas’r Davy	256	’ ‘
409407	409410	409411	409411	Martha	442	’ said I. ‘
409413	409432	409411	409411	Martha	442	’ He touched the younger woman I have mentioned on the shoulder , and Martha stood before me . ‘
409441	409444	409435	409435	you	7829	’ cried I. ‘
409451	413572	409445	409445	You	7829	’ She answered for him , with a burst of tears . I could speak no more at that time , but I wrung his hand ; and if ever I have loved and honoured any man , I loved and honoured that man in my soul . The ship was clearing fast of strangers . The greatest trial that I had , remained . I told him what the noble spirit that was gone , had given me in charge to say at parting . It moved him deeply . But when he charged me , in return , with many messages of affection and regret for those deaf ears , he moved me more . The time was come . I embraced him , took my weeping nurse upon my arm , and hurried away . On deck , I took leave of poor Mrs. Micawber . She was looking distractedly about for her family , even then ; and her last words to me were , that she never would desert Mr. Micawber . We went over the side into our boat , and lay at a little distance , to see the ship wafted on her course . It was then calm , radiant sunset . She lay between us , and the red light ; and every taper line and spar was visible against the glow . A sight at once so beautiful , so mournful , and so hopeful , as the glorious ship , lying , still , on the flushed water , with all the life on board her crowded at the bulwarks , and there clustering , for a moment , bare - headed and silent , I never saw . Silent , only for a moment . As the sails rose to the wind , and the ship began to move , there broke from all the boats three resounding cheers , which those on board took up , and echoed back , and which were echoed and re - echoed . My heart burst out when I heard the sound , and beheld the waving of the hats and handkerchiefs -- and then I saw her ! Then I saw her , at her uncle ’s side , and trembling on his shoulder . He pointed to us with an eager hand ; and she saw us , and waved her last good - bye to me . Aye , Emily , beautiful and drooping , cling to him with the utmost trust of thy bruised heart ; for he has clung to thee , with all the might of his great love ! Surrounded by the rosy light , and standing high upon the deck , apart together , she clinging to him , and he holding her , they solemnly passed away . The night had fallen on the Kentish hills when we were rowed ashore -- and fallen darkly upon me . CHAPTER 58 . ABSENCE It was a long and gloomy night that gathered on me , haunted by the ghosts of many hopes , of many dear remembrances , many errors , many unavailing sorrows and regrets . I went away from England ; not knowing , even then , how great the shock was , that I had to bear . I left all who were dear to me , and went away ; and believed that I had borne it , and it was past . As a man upon a field of battle will receive a mortal hurt , and scarcely know that he is struck , so I , when I was left alone with my undisciplined heart , had no conception of the wound with which it had to strive . The knowledge came upon me , not quickly , but little by little , and grain by grain . The desolate feeling with which I went abroad , deepened and widened hourly . At first it was a heavy sense of loss and sorrow , wherein I could distinguish little else . By imperceptible degrees , it became a hopeless consciousness of all that I had lost -- love , friendship , interest ; of all that had been shattered -- my first trust , my first affection , the whole airy castle of my life ; of all that remained -- a ruined blank and waste , lying wide around me , unbroken , to the dark horizon . If my grief were selfish , I did not know it to be so . I mourned for my child - wife , taken from her blooming world , so young . I mourned for him who might have won the love and admiration of thousands , as he had won mine long ago . I mourned for the broken heart that had found rest in the stormy sea ; and for the wandering remnants of the simple home , where I had heard the night - wind blowing , when I was a child . From the accumulated sadness into which I fell , I had at length no hope of ever issuing again . I roamed from place to place , carrying my burden with me everywhere . I felt its whole weight now ; and I drooped beneath it , and I said in my heart that it could never be lightened . When this despondency was at its worst , I believed that I should die . Sometimes , I thought that I would like to die at home ; and actually turned back on my road , that I might get there soon . At other times , I passed on farther away,--from city to city , seeking I know not what , and trying to leave I know not what behind . It is not in my power to retrace , one by one , all the weary phases of distress of mind through which I passed . There are some dreams that can only be imperfectly and vaguely described ; and when I oblige myself to look back on this time of my life , I seem to be recalling such a dream . I see myself passing on among the novelties of foreign towns , palaces , cathedrals , temples , pictures , castles , tombs , fantastic streets -- the old abiding places of History and Fancy -- as a dreamer might ; bearing my painful load through all , and hardly conscious of the objects as they fade before me . Listlessness to everything , but brooding sorrow , was the night that fell on my undisciplined heart . Let me look up from it -- as at last I did , thank Heaven!--and from its long , sad , wretched dream , to dawn . For many months I travelled with this ever - darkening cloud upon my mind . Some blind reasons that I had for not returning home -- reasons then struggling within me , vainly , for more distinct expression -- kept me on my pilgrimage . Sometimes , I had proceeded restlessly from place to place , stopping nowhere ; sometimes , I had lingered long in one spot . I had had no purpose , no sustaining soul within me , anywhere . I was in Switzerland . I had come out of Italy , over one of the great passes of the Alps , and had since wandered with a guide among the by - ways of the mountains . If those awful solitudes had spoken to my heart , I did not know it . I had found sublimity and wonder in the dread heights and precipices , in the roaring torrents , and the wastes of ice and snow ; but as yet , they had taught me nothing else . I came , one evening before sunset , down into a valley , where I was to rest . In the course of my descent to it , by the winding track along the mountain - side , from which I saw it shining far below , I think some long - unwonted sense of beauty and tranquillity , some softening influence awakened by its peace , moved faintly in my breast . I remember pausing once , with a kind of sorrow that was not all oppressive , not quite despairing . I remember almost hoping that some better change was possible within me . I came into the valley , as the evening sun was shining on the remote heights of snow , that closed it in , like eternal clouds . The bases of the mountains forming the gorge in which the little village lay , were richly green ; and high above this gentler vegetation , grew forests of dark fir , cleaving the wintry snow - drift , wedge - like , and stemming the avalanche . Above these , were range upon range of craggy steeps , grey rock , bright ice , and smooth verdure - specks of pasture , all gradually blending with the crowning snow . Dotted here and there on the mountain’s - side , each tiny dot a home , were lonely wooden cottages , so dwarfed by the towering heights that they appeared too small for toys . So did even the clustered village in the valley , with its wooden bridge across the stream , where the stream tumbled over broken rocks , and roared away among the trees . In the quiet air , there was a sound of distant singing -- shepherd voices ; but , as one bright evening cloud floated midway along the mountain’s - side , I could almost have believed it came from there , and was not earthly music . All at once , in this serenity , great Nature spoke to me ; and soothed me to lay down my weary head upon the grass , and weep as I had not wept yet , since Dora died ! I had found a packet of letters awaiting me but a few minutes before , and had strolled out of the village to read them while my supper was making ready . Other packets had missed me , and I had received none for a long time . Beyond a line or two , to say that I was well , and had arrived at such a place , I had not had fortitude or constancy to write a letter since I left home . The packet was in my hand . I opened it , and read the writing of Agnes . She was happy and useful , was prospering as she had hoped . That was all she told me of herself . The rest referred to me . She gave me no advice ; she urged no duty on me ; she only told me , in her own fervent manner , what her trust in me was . She knew ( she said ) how such a nature as mine would turn affliction to good . She knew how trial and emotion would exalt and strengthen it . She was sure that in my every purpose I should gain a firmer and a higher tendency , through the grief I had undergone . She , who so gloried in my fame , and so looked forward to its augmentation , well knew that I would labour on . She knew that in me , sorrow could not be weakness , but must be strength . As the endurance of my childish days had done its part to make me what I was , so greater calamities would nerve me on , to be yet better than I was ; and so , as they had taught me , would I teach others . She commended me to God , who had taken my innocent darling to His rest ; and in her sisterly affection cherished me always , and was always at my side go where I would ; proud of what I had done , but infinitely prouder yet of what I was reserved to do . I put the letter in my breast , and thought what had I been an hour ago ! When I heard the voices die away , and saw the quiet evening cloud grow dim , and all the colours in the valley fade , and the golden snow upon the mountain - tops become a remote part of the pale night sky , yet felt that the night was passing from my mind , and all its shadows clearing , there was no name for the love I bore her , dearer to me , henceforward , than ever until then . I read her letter many times . I wrote to her before I slept . I told her that I had been in sore need of her help ; that without her I was not , and I never had been , what she thought me ; but that she inspired me to be that , and I would try . I did try . In three months more , a year would have passed since the beginning of my sorrow . I determined to make no resolutions until the expiration of those three months , but to try . I lived in that valley , and its neighbourhood , all the time . The three months gone , I resolved to remain away from home for some time longer ; to settle myself for the present in Switzerland , which was growing dear to me in the remembrance of that evening ; to resume my pen ; to work . I resorted humbly whither Agnes had commended me ; I sought out Nature , never sought in vain ; and I admitted to my breast the human interest I had lately shrunk from . It was not long , before I had almost as many friends in the valley as in Yarmouth : and when I left it , before the winter set in , for Geneva , and came back in the spring , their cordial greetings had a homely sound to me , although they were not conveyed in English words . I worked early and late , patiently and hard . I wrote a Story , with a purpose growing , not remotely , out of my experience , and sent it to Traddles , and he arranged for its publication very advantageously for me ; and the tidings of my growing reputation began to reach me from travellers whom I encountered by chance . After some rest and change , I fell to work , in my old ardent way , on a new fancy , which took strong possession of me . As I advanced in the execution of this task , I felt it more and more , and roused my utmost energies to do it well . This was my third work of fiction . It was not half written , when , in an interval of rest , I thought of returning home . For a long time , though studying and working patiently , I had accustomed myself to robust exercise . My health , severely impaired when I left England , was quite restored . I had seen much . I had been in many countries , and I hope I had improved my store of knowledge . I have now recalled all that I think it needful to recall here , of this term of absence -- with one reservation . I have made it , thus far , with no purpose of suppressing any of my thoughts ; for , as I have elsewhere said , this narrative is my written memory . I have desired to keep the most secret current of my mind apart , and to the last . I enter on it now . I can not so completely penetrate the mystery of my own heart , as to know when I began to think that I might have set its earliest and brightest hopes on Agnes . I can not say at what stage of my grief it first became associated with the reflection , that , in my wayward boyhood , I had thrown away the treasure of her love . I believe I may have heard some whisper of that distant thought , in the old unhappy loss or want of something never to be realized , of which I had been sensible . But the thought came into my mind as a new reproach and new regret , when I was left so sad and lonely in the world . If , at that time , I had been much with her , I should , in the weakness of my desolation , have betrayed this . It was what I remotely dreaded when I was first impelled to stay away from England . I could not have borne to lose the smallest portion of her sisterly affection ; yet , in that betrayal , I should have set a constraint between us hitherto unknown . I could not forget that the feeling with which she now regarded me had grown up in my own free choice and course . That if she had ever loved me with another love -- and I sometimes thought the time was when she might have done so -- I had cast it away . It was nothing , now , that I had accustomed myself to think of her , when we were both mere children , as one who was far removed from my wild fancies . I had bestowed my passionate tenderness upon another object ; and what I might have done , I had not done ; and what Agnes was to me , I and her own noble heart had made her . In the beginning of the change that gradually worked in me , when I tried to get a better understanding of myself and be a better man , I did glance , through some indefinite probation , to a period when I might possibly hope to cancel the mistaken past , and to be so blessed as to marry her . But , as time wore on , this shadowy prospect faded , and departed from me . If she had ever loved me , then , I should hold her the more sacred ; remembering the confidences I had reposed in her , her knowledge of my errant heart , the sacrifice she must have made to be my friend and sister , and the victory she had won . If she had never loved me , could I believe that she would love me now ? I had always felt my weakness , in comparison with her constancy and fortitude ; and now I felt it more and more . Whatever I might have been to her , or she to me , if I had been more worthy of her long ago , I was not now , and she was not . The time was past . I had let it go by , and had deservedly lost her . That I suffered much in these contentions , that they filled me with unhappiness and remorse , and yet that I had a sustaining sense that it was required of me , in right and honour , to keep away from myself , with shame , the thought of turning to the dear girl in the withering of my hopes , from whom I had frivolously turned when they were bright and fresh -- which consideration was at the root of every thought I had concerning her -- is all equally true . I made no effort to conceal from myself , now , that I loved her , that I was devoted to her ; but I brought the assurance home to myself , that it was now too late , and that our long - subsisting relation must be undisturbed . I had thought , much and often , of my Dora ’s shadowing out to me what might have happened , in those years that were destined not to try us ; I had considered how the things that never happen , are often as much realities to us , in their effects , as those that are accomplished . The very years she spoke of , were realities now , for my correction ; and would have been , one day , a little later perhaps , though we had parted in our earliest folly . I endeavoured to convert what might have been between myself and Agnes , into a means of making me more self - denying , more resolved , more conscious of myself , and my defects and errors . Thus , through the reflection that it might have been , I arrived at the conviction that it could never be . These , with their perplexities and inconsistencies , were the shifting quicksands of my mind , from the time of my departure to the time of my return home , three years afterwards . Three years had elapsed since the sailing of the emigrant ship ; when , at that same hour of sunset , and in the same place , I stood on the deck of the packet vessel that brought me home , looking on the rosy water where I had seen the image of that ship reflected . Three years . Long in the aggregate , though short as they went by . And home was very dear to me , and Agnes too -- but she was not mine -- she was never to be mine . She might have been , but that was past ! CHAPTER 59 . RETURN I landed in London on a wintry autumn evening . It was dark and raining , and I saw more fog and mud in a minute than I had seen in a year . I walked from the Custom House to the Monument before I found a coach ; and although the very house - fronts , looking on the swollen gutters , were like old friends to me , I could not but admit that they were very dingy friends . I have often remarked -- I suppose everybody has -- that one ’s going away from a familiar place , would seem to be the signal for change in it . As I looked out of the coach window , and observed that an old house on Fish - street Hill , which had stood untouched by painter , carpenter , or bricklayer , for a century , had been pulled down in my absence ; and that a neighbouring street , of time - honoured insalubrity and inconvenience , was being drained and widened ; I half expected to find St. Paul ’s Cathedral looking older . For some changes in the fortunes of my friends , I was prepared . My aunt had long been re - established at Dover , and Traddles had begun to get into some little practice at the Bar , in the very first term after my departure . He had chambers in Gray ’s Inn , now ; and had told me , in his last letters , that he was not without hopes of being soon united to the dearest girl in the world . They expected me home before Christmas ; but had no idea of my returning so soon . I had purposely misled them , that I might have the pleasure of taking them by surprise . And yet , I was perverse enough to feel a chill and disappointment in receiving no welcome , and rattling , alone and silent , through the misty streets . The well - known shops , however , with their cheerful lights , did something for me ; and when I alighted at the door of the Gray ’s Inn Coffee - house , I had recovered my spirits . It recalled , at first , that so - different time when I had put up at the Golden Cross , and reminded me of the changes that had come to pass since then ; but that was natural . ‘
413584	413601	413577	413578	Mr. Traddles	306	’ I asked the waiter , as I warmed myself by the coffee - room fire . ‘
413610	413611	413612	413613	Mr. Traddles	306	’ ‘
413625	413628	413622	413622	I	0	’ said I. ‘
413633	413638	413640	413640	he	306	’ returned the waiter , ‘
413654	413739	413652	413652	myself	0	’ This waiter , who was middle - aged and spare , looked for help to a waiter of more authority -- a stout , potential old man , with a double chin , in black breeches and stockings , who came out of a place like a churchwarden ’s pew , at the end of the coffee - room , where he kept company with a cash - box , a Directory , a Law - list , and other books and papers . ‘
413743	413749	413740	413741	Mr. Traddles	306	’ said the spare waiter . ‘
413756	413772	413773	413773	I	0	’ The potential waiter waved him away , and turned , gravely , to me . ‘
413777	413781	413652	413652	myself	0	’ said I , ‘
413802	413803	413773	413773	I	0	’ ‘
413809	413827	413773	413773	I	0	’ said the waiter , in a rich husky voice . I felt quite apologetic for Traddles . ‘
413836	413849	413830	413832	a young man	11003	’ said the portentous waiter , fixing his eyes severely on me . ‘
413859	413860	413830	413832	a young man	11003	’ ‘
413866	414780	413830	413832	a young man	11003	’ said I. The waiter , who I supposed had lived in his churchwarden ’s pew for forty years , could not pursue such an insignificant subject . He asked me what I would have for dinner ? I felt I was in England again , and really was quite cast down on Traddles ’s account . There seemed to be no hope for him . I meekly ordered a bit of fish and a steak , and stood before the fire musing on his obscurity . As I followed the chief waiter with my eyes , I could not help thinking that the garden in which he had gradually blown to be the flower he was , was an arduous place to rise in . It had such a prescriptive , stiff - necked , long - established , solemn , elderly air . I glanced about the room , which had had its sanded floor sanded , no doubt , in exactly the same manner when the chief waiter was a boy -- if he ever was a boy , which appeared improbable ; and at the shining tables , where I saw myself reflected , in unruffled depths of old mahogany ; and at the lamps , without a flaw in their trimming or cleaning ; and at the comfortable green curtains , with their pure brass rods , snugly enclosing the boxes ; and at the two large coal fires , brightly burning ; and at the rows of decanters , burly as if with the consciousness of pipes of expensive old port wine below ; and both England , and the law , appeared to me to be very difficult indeed to be taken by storm . I went up to my bedroom to change my wet clothes ; and the vast extent of that old wainscoted apartment ( which was over the archway leading to the Inn , I remember ) , and the sedate immensity of the four - post bedstead , and the indomitable gravity of the chests of drawers , all seemed to unite in sternly frowning on the fortunes of Traddles , or on any such daring youth . I came down again to my dinner ; and even the slow comfort of the meal , and the orderly silence of the place -- which was bare of guests , the Long Vacation not yet being over -- were eloquent on the audacity of Traddles , and his small hopes of a livelihood for twenty years to come . I had seen nothing like this since I went away , and it quite dashed my hopes for my friend . The chief waiter had had enough of me . He came near me no more ; but devoted himself to an old gentleman in long gaiters , to meet whom a pint of special port seemed to come out of the cellar of its own accord , for he gave no order . The second waiter informed me , in a whisper , that this old gentleman was a retired conveyancer living in the Square , and worth a mint of money , which it was expected he would leave to his laundress ’s daughter ; likewise that it was rumoured that he had a service of plate in a bureau , all tarnished with lying by , though more than one spoon and a fork had never yet been beheld in his chambers by mortal vision . By this time , I quite gave Traddles up for lost ; and settled in my own mind that there was no hope for him . Being very anxious to see the dear old fellow , nevertheless , I dispatched my dinner , in a manner not at all calculated to raise me in the opinion of the chief waiter , and hurried out by the back way . Number two in the Court was soon reached ; and an inscription on the door - post informing me that Mr. Traddles occupied a set of chambers on the top storey , I ascended the staircase . A crazy old staircase I found it to be , feebly lighted on each landing by a club - headed little oil wick , dying away in a little dungeon of dirty glass . In the course of my stumbling upstairs , I fancied I heard a pleasant sound of laughter ; and not the laughter of an attorney or barrister , or attorney ’s clerk or barrister ’s clerk , but of two or three merry girls . Happening , however , as I stopped to listen , to put my foot in a hole where the Honourable Society of Gray ’s Inn had left a plank deficient , I fell down with some noise , and when I recovered my footing all was silent . Groping my way more carefully , for the rest of the journey , my heart beat high when I found the outer door , which had Mr. TRADDLES painted on it , open . I knocked . A considerable scuffling within ensued , but nothing else . I therefore knocked again . A small sharp - looking lad , half - footboy and half - clerk , who was very much out of breath , but who looked at me as if he defied me to prove it legally , presented himself . ‘
414786	414790	414782	414783	Mr. Traddles	306	’ I said . ‘
414800	414801	414796	414796	he	306	’ ‘
414808	414886	414796	414796	he	306	’ After a moment ’s survey of me , the sharp - looking lad decided to let me in ; and opening the door wider for that purpose , admitted me , first , into a little closet of a hall , and next into a little sitting - room ; where I came into the presence of my old friend ( also out of breath ) , seated at a table , and bending over papers . ‘
414890	414897	414887	414888	Good God	245	’ cried Traddles , looking up . ‘
414902	414915	414900	414900	Copperfield	232	’ and rushed into my arms , where I held him tight . ‘
414923	414924	414921	414921	Traddles	306	’ ‘
414940	414950	414951	414953	My dear fellow	11053	’ We cried with pleasure , both of us . ‘
414955	414973	414951	414953	My dear fellow	11053	’ said Traddles , rumpling his hair in his excitement , which was a most unnecessary operation , ‘
415023	415045	415046	415046	My	0	’ I was equally at a loss to express my emotions . I was quite unable to speak , at first . ‘
415050	415054	415046	415046	My	0	’ said Traddles . ‘
415085	415185	415066	415066	me	0	’ Never pausing for an answer to anything he said , Traddles , who had clapped me into an easy - chair by the fire , all this time impetuously stirred the fire with one hand , and pulled at my neck - kerchief with the other , under some wild delusion that it was a great - coat . Without putting down the poker , he now hugged me again ; and I hugged him ; and , both laughing , and both wiping our eyes , we both sat down , and shook hands across the hearth . ‘
415189	415193	415066	415066	me	0	’ said Traddles , ‘
415220	415221	415227	415227	Traddles	306	’ ‘

415235	415247	415227	415227	Traddles	306	’ cried Traddles , opening his eyes in his old way . ‘

415268	415269	415227	415227	Traddles	306	’ ‘
415276	415297	415274	415274	Copperfield	232	’ said Traddles , sticking his hair upright with both hands , and then putting his hands on my knees , ‘
415302	415303	415274	415274	Copperfield	232	’ ‘
415306	415311	415312	415312	Lord	7856	’ I cried joyfully . ‘
415318	415348	415312	415312	Lord	7856	’ said Traddles--‘by the Reverend Horace -- to Sophy -- down in Devonshire . Why , my dear boy , she ’s behind the window curtain ! Look here ! ’
415429	415433	415435	415435	Traddles	306	‘ Dear me , ’
415437	415467	415435	415435	Traddles	306	‘ what a delightful re - union this is ! You are so extremely brown , my dear Copperfield ! God bless my soul , how happy I am ! ’

415477	415485	415487	415491	the blushing and laughing Sophy	7863	‘ And I am sure I am ! ’
415493	415502	415504	415504	Traddles	306	‘ We are all as happy as possible ! ’
415506	415522	415504	415504	Traddles	306	‘ Even the girls are happy . Dear me , I declare I forgot them ! ’
415523	415526	415528	415528	I.	0	‘ Forgot ? ’
415529	415533	415535	415535	Traddles	306	‘ The girls , ’
415537	415573	415535	415535	Traddles	306	‘ Sophy ’s sisters . They are staying with us . They have come to have a peep at London . The fact is , when -- was it you that tumbled upstairs , Copperfield ? ’
415574	415578	415580	415580	I	0	‘ It was , ’
415584	415593	415595	415595	Traddles	306	‘ Well then , when you tumbled upstairs , ’
415597	415660	415662	415662	Traddles	306	‘ I was romping with the girls . In point of fact , we were playing at Puss in the Corner . But as that would n’t do in Westminster Hall , and as it would n’t look quite professional if they were seen by a client , they decamped . And they are now -- listening , I have no doubt , ’
415672	415677	415679	415679	I	0	‘ I am sorry , ’
415684	415692	415679	415679	I	0	‘ to have occasioned such a dispersion . ’
415693	415698	415700	415700	Traddles	306	‘ Upon my word , ’
415705	415761	415700	415700	Traddles	306	‘ if you had seen them running away , and running back again , after you had knocked , to pick up the combs they had dropped out of their hair , and going on in the maddest manner , you would n’t have said so . My love , will you fetch the girls ? ’
415781	415793	415795	415795	Traddles	306	‘ Really musical , is n’t it , my dear Copperfield ? ’
415797	415905	415795	415795	Traddles	306	‘ It ’s very agreeable to hear . It quite lights up these old rooms . To an unfortunate bachelor of a fellow who has lived alone all his life , you know , it ’s positively delicious . It ’s charming . Poor things , they have had a great loss in Sophy -- who , I do assure you , Copperfield is , and ever was , the dearest girl!--and it gratifies me beyond expression to find them in such good spirits . The society of girls is a very delightful thing , Copperfield . It ’s not professional , but it ’s very delightful . ’
415950	415954	415956	415956	Traddles	306	‘ But then , ’
415958	416042	415956	415956	Traddles	306	‘ our domestic arrangements are , to say the truth , quite unprofessional altogether , my dear Copperfield . Even Sophy ’s being here , is unprofessional . And we have no other place of abode . We have put to sea in a cockboat , but we are quite prepared to rough it . And Sophy ’s an extraordinary manager ! You ’ll be surprised how those girls are stowed away . I am sure I hardly know how it ’s done ! ’
416043	416053	416054	416054	I	0	‘ Are many of the young ladies with you ? ’
416057	416066	416068	416068	Traddles	534	‘ The eldest , the Beauty is here , ’
416076	416121	416068	416068	Traddles	534	‘ Caroline . And Sarah ’s here -- the one I mentioned to you as having something the matter with her spine , you know . Immensely better ! And the two youngest that Sophy educated are with us . And Louisa ’s here . ’
416122	416125	416127	416127	I.	0	‘ Indeed ! ’
416128	416131	416133	416133	Traddles	534	‘ Yes , ’
416135	416176	416178	416178	Traddles	534	‘ Now the whole set -- I mean the chambers -- is only three rooms ; but Sophy arranges for the girls in the most wonderful way , and they sleep as comfortably as possible . Three in that room , ’
416182	416187	416178	416178	Traddles	534	‘ Two in that . ’
416211	416214	416216	416216	Traddles	615	‘ Well ! ’
416218	416263	416216	416216	Traddles	615	‘ we are prepared to rough it , as I said just now , and we did improvise a bed last week , upon the floor here . But there ’s a little room in the roof -- a very nice room , when you ’re

416520	416582	416501	416501	Traddles	534	‘ after I had delivered my argument in DOE dem . JIPES versus WIGZIELL , which did me great service with the profession , I went down into Devonshire , and had some serious conversation in private with the Reverend Horace . I dwelt upon the fact that Sophy -- who I do assure you , Copperfield , is the dearest girl!-- ’
416583	416590	416592	416592	I.	7878	‘ I am certain she is ! ’
416593	416599	416601	416601	Traddles	534	‘ She is , indeed ! ’
416603	416622	416601	416601	Traddles	534	‘ But I am afraid I am wandering from the subject . Did I mention the Reverend Horace ? ’
416623	416632	416501	416501	Traddles	534	‘ You said that you dwelt upon the fact-- ’
416633	416673	416675	416675	Traddles	534	‘ True ! Upon the fact that Sophy and I had been engaged for a long period , and that Sophy , with the permission of her parents , was more than content to take me -- in short , ’
416683	416846	416675	416675	Traddles	534	‘ on our present Britannia - metal footing . Very well . I then proposed to the Reverend Horace -- who is a most excellent clergyman , Copperfield , and ought to be a Bishop ; or at least ought to have enough to live upon , without pinching himself -- that if I could turn the corner , say of two hundred and fifty pounds , in one year ; and could see my way pretty clearly to that , or something better , next year ; and could plainly furnish a little place like this , besides ; then , and in that case , Sophy and I should be united . I took the liberty of representing that we had been patient for a good many years ; and that the circumstance of Sophy ’s being extraordinarily useful at home , ought not to operate with her affectionate parents , against her establishment in life -- don’t you see ? ’
416847	416853	416855	416855	I.	7880	‘ Certainly it ought not , ’
416856	416866	416868	416868	Traddles	534	‘ I am glad you think so , Copperfield , ’
416870	416945	416868	416868	Traddles	534	‘ because , without any imputation on the Reverend Horace , I do think parents , and brothers , and so forth , are sometimes rather selfish in such cases . Well ! I also pointed out , that my most earnest desire was , to be useful to the family ; and that if I got on in the world , and anything should happen to him -- I refer to the Reverend Horace-- ’
416946	416950	416952	416952	I.	7880	‘ I understand , ’
416953	417028	416952	416952	I.	7880	‘ --Or to Mrs. Crewler -- it would be the utmost gratification of my wishes , to be a parent to the girls . He replied in a most admirable manner , exceedingly flattering to my feelings , and undertook to obtain the consent of Mrs. Crewler to this arrangement . They had a dreadful time of it with her . It mounted from her legs into her chest , and then into her head-- ’
417029	417033	417034	417034	I	0	‘ What mounted ? ’
417037	417041	417043	417043	Traddles	534	‘ Her grief , ’
417050	417217	417043	417043	Traddles	534	‘ Her feelings generally . As I mentioned on a former occasion , she is a very superior woman , but has lost the use of her limbs . Whatever occurs to harass her , usually settles in her legs ; but on this occasion it mounted to the chest , and then to the head , and , in short , pervaded the whole system in a most alarming manner . However , they brought her through it by unremitting and affectionate attention ; and we were married yesterday six weeks . You have no idea what a Monster I felt , Copperfield , when I saw the whole family crying and fainting away in every direction ! Mrs. Crewler could n’t see me before we left -- couldn’t forgive me , then , for depriving her of her child -- but she is a good creature , and has done so since . I had a delightful letter from her , only this morning . ’
417218	417227	417229	417229	I	0	‘ And in short , my dear friend , ’
417231	417242	417229	417229	I	0	‘ you feel as blest as you deserve to feel ! ’
417243	417251	417253	417253	Traddles	534	‘ Oh ! That ’s your partiality ! ’
417255	417341	417343	417343	Traddles	534	‘ But , indeed , I am in a most enviable state . I work hard , and read Law insatiably . I get up at five every morning , and do n’t mind it at all . I hide the girls in the daytime , and make merry with them in the evening . And I assure you I am quite sorry that they are going home on Tuesday , which is the day before the first day of Michaelmas Term . But here , ’
417355	417376	417343	417343	Traddles	534	‘ ARE the girls ! Mr. Copperfield , Miss Crewler -- Miss Sarah -- Miss Louisa -- Margaret and Lucy ! ’

418311	418926	418929	418929	you	7931	’ offices ; and of the tea and toast , and children ’s songs , in that grim atmosphere of pounce and parchment , red - tape , dusty wafers , ink - jars , brief and draft paper , law reports , writs , declarations , and bills of costs ; seemed almost as pleasantly fanciful as if I had dreamed that the Sultan ’s famous family had been admitted on the roll of attorneys , and had brought the talking bird , the singing tree , and the golden water into Gray ’s Inn Hall . Somehow , I found that I had taken leave of Traddles for the night , and come back to the coffee - house , with a great change in my despondency about him . I began to think he would get on , in spite of all the many orders of chief waiters in England . Drawing a chair before one of the coffee - room fires to think about him at my leisure , I gradually fell from the consideration of his happiness to tracing prospects in the live - coals , and to thinking , as they broke and changed , of the principal vicissitudes and separations that had marked my life . I had not seen a coal fire , since I had left England three years ago : though many a wood fire had I watched , as it crumbled into hoary ashes , and mingled with the feathery heap upon the hearth , which not inaptly figured to me , in my despondency , my own dead hopes . I could think of the past now , gravely , but not bitterly ; and could contemplate the future in a brave spirit . Home , in its best sense , was for me no more . She in whom I might have inspired a dearer love , I had taught to be my sister . She would marry , and would have new claimants on her tenderness ; and in doing it , would never know the love for her that had grown up in my heart . It was right that I should pay the forfeit of my headlong passion . What I reaped , I had sown . I was thinking . And had I truly disciplined my heart to this , and could I resolutely bear it , and calmly hold the place in her home which she had calmly held in mine,--when I found my eyes resting on a countenance that might have arisen out of the fire , in its association with my early remembrances . Little Mr. Chillip the Doctor , to whose good offices I was indebted in the very first chapter of this history , sat reading a newspaper in the shadow of an opposite corner . He was tolerably stricken in years by this time ; but , being a mild , meek , calm little man , had worn so easily , that I thought he looked at that moment just as he might have looked when he sat in our parlour , waiting for me to be born . Mr. Chillip had left Blunderstone six or seven years ago , and I had never seen him since . He sat placidly perusing the newspaper , with his little head on one side , and a glass of warm sherry negus at his elbow . He was so extremely conciliatory in his manner that he seemed to apologize to the very newspaper for taking the liberty of reading it . I walked up to where he was sitting , and said , ‘
418935	418956	418932	418933	Mr. Chillip	237	’ He was greatly fluttered by this unexpected address from a stranger , and replied , in his slow way , ‘
418979	418980	418973	418973	I	0	’ ‘
418987	418990	418981	418981	You	7931	’ said I. ‘
418995	419013	418993	418993	sir	979	’ returned Mr. Chillip , smiling very meekly , and shaking his head as he surveyed me , ‘
419046	419047	419034	419034	I	0	’ ‘
419061	419065	419050	419050	you	7931	’ I returned . ‘
419072	419077	419067	419067	I	0	’ said Mr. Chillip . ‘

419128	419131	419113	419113	you	979	’ said I. ‘
419136	419141	419134	419134	sir	979	’ observed Mr. Chillip , ‘
419161	419254	419150	419150	I	0	’ On my telling him my name , he was really moved . He quite shook hands with me -- which was a violent proceeding for him , his usual course being to slide a tepid little fish - slice , an inch or two in advance of his hip , and evince the greatest discomposure when anybody grappled with it . Even now , he put his hand in his coat - pocket as soon as he could disengage it , and seemed relieved when he had got it safe back . ‘
419260	419274	419258	419258	sir	979	’ said Mr. Chillip , surveying me with his head on one side . ‘
419323	419324	419321	419321	sir	979	’ ‘
419335	419339	419325	419325	I	0	’ I observed . ‘
419345	419355	419343	419343	sir	979	’ said Mr. Chillip , in a soothing tone . ‘
419376	419388	419343	419343	sir	979	’ said Mr. Chillip , slowly shaking his little head again , ‘
419410	419424	419408	419408	sir	979	’ said Mr. Chillip , tapping himself on the forehead with his forefinger . ‘
419435	419436	419433	419433	sir	979	’ ‘
419446	419455	419433	419433	sir	979	’ I asked , seating myself near him . ‘
419471	419476	419469	419469	sir	979	’ said Mr. Chillip . ‘
419527	419540	419525	419525	sir	979	’ said Mr. Chillip , giving his little head another little shake . ‘
419563	419601	419561	419561	sir	979	’ As the little man put his now empty glass to his lips , when he made this reflection , I proposed to him to have it refilled , and I would keep him company with another . ‘
419606	419615	419561	419561	sir	979	’ he returned , in his slow way , ‘
419661	419677	419653	419653	You	979	’ I acknowledged this compliment , and ordered the negus , which was soon produced . ‘
419683	419691	419693	419693	I	0	’ said Mr. Chillip , stirring it , ‘
419709	419715	419707	419707	sir	979	’ I shook my head . ‘
419731	419736	419725	419725	sir	979	’ said Mr. Chillip . ‘
419757	419758	419755	419755	sir	979	’ ‘
419763	419767	419755	419755	sir	979	’ said I , ‘
419780	419781	419773	419773	you	979	’ ‘
419789	419799	419783	419783	you	979	’ returned Mr. Chillip , with his placidest smile , ‘
419814	419815	419801	419806	your father - in - law	9362	’ ‘
419818	419821	419801	419806	your father - in - law	9362	’ said I. ‘
419828	419833	419822	419822	He	9362	’ said Mr. Chillip . ‘
419868	419892	419866	419866	you	979	’ said Mr. Chillip , looking at me like an admiring Robin . I waived that question , and returned to the Murdstones . ‘
419908	419912	419903	419903	you	979	’ I asked . ‘
419922	419926	419916	419916	I	0	’ he replied . ‘
419945	419979	419943	419943	sir	979	’ I replied with such an expressive look , that Mr. Chillip was emboldened by that , and the negus together , to give his head several short shakes , and thoughtfully exclaim , ‘
419993	419994	419990	419991	Mr. Copperfield	232	’ ‘
420009	420012	419999	419999	sister	4810	’ said I. ‘
420017	420022	420031	420031	families	7987	’ replied Mr. Chillip , ‘

420085	420089	420081	420081	I	0	’ I returned : ‘
420098	420113	420092	420092	they	7988	’ Mr. Chillip shook his head , stirred his negus , and sipped it . ‘
420122	420130	420114	420114	She	7990	’ he observed in a plaintive manner . ‘
420136	420137	420138	420140	A charming woman	7991	’ ‘
420145	420150	420138	420140	A charming woman	7991	’ said Mr. Chillip ; ‘
420195	420202	420192	420193	the ladies	11924	’ observed Mr. Chillip , timorously , ‘
420209	420210	420192	420193	the ladies	11924	’ ‘
420229	420232	420234	420234	she	7990	’ said I. ‘

420255	420260	420251	420251	I	0	’ said Mr. Chillip ; ‘
420311	420321	420322	420322	I	0	’ I told him I could easily believe it . ‘
420329	420342	420322	420322	I	0	’ said Mr. Chillip , fortifying himself with another sip of negus , ‘
420448	420449	420451	420451	he	8012	’ ‘
420471	420475	420476	420476	You	979	’ I inquired . ‘
420481	420501	420504	420505	Mrs. Chillip	654	’ said Mr. Chillip , his eyelids getting quite red with the unwonted stimulus in which he was indulging . ‘
420514	420525	420511	420512	Mrs. Chillip	654	’ he proceeded , in the calmest and slowest manner , ‘
420590	420591	420582	420583	The ladies	11924	’ ‘
420594	420603	420582	420583	The ladies	11924	’ said I , to his extreme delight . ‘
420618	420622	420616	420616	sir	979	’ he rejoined . ‘
420678	420679	420680	420680	I	0	’ ‘
420689	420692	420682	420683	Mrs. Chillip	654	’ said I. ‘
420703	420714	420693	420694	Mrs. Chillip	654	’ pursued the meekest of little men , much encouraged , ‘
420743	420755	420735	420735	you	979	’ he continued , mildly laying his head on one side , ‘
420771	420772	420773	420773	I	0	’ ‘
420779	420782	420773	420773	I	0	’ said I. ‘
420789	420794	420773	420773	I	0	’ said Mr. Chillip , ‘
420899	420999	420887	420887	you	979	’ I found it not difficult , in the excitement of Mr. Chillip ’s own brain , under his potations of negus , to divert his attention from this topic to his own affairs , on which , for the next half - hour , he was quite loquacious ; giving me to understand , among other pieces of information , that he was then at the Gray ’s Inn Coffee - house to lay his professional evidence before a Commission of Lunacy , touching the state of mind of a patient who had become deranged from excessive drinking . ‘
421007	421011	421001	421001	I	0	’ he said , ‘
421065	421143	421051	421053	that alarming lady	8032	’ I told him that I was going down to my aunt , the Dragon of that night , early in the morning ; and that she was one of the most tender - hearted and excellent of women , as he would know full well if he knew her better . The mere notion of the possibility of his ever seeing her again , appeared to terrify him . He replied with a small pale smile , ‘
421154	421354	421145	421145	she	8032	’ and almost immediately called for a candle , and went to bed , as if he were not quite safe anywhere else . He did not actually stagger under the negus ; but I should think his placid little pulse must have made two or three more beats in a minute , than it had done since the great night of my aunt ’s disappointment , when she struck at him with her bonnet . Thoroughly tired , I went to bed too , at midnight ; passed the next day on the Dover coach ; burst safe and sound into my aunt ’s old parlour while she was at tea ( she wore spectacles now ) ; and was received by her , and Mr. Dick , and dear old Peggotty , who acted as housekeeper , with open arms and tears of joy . My aunt was mightily amused , when we began to talk composedly , by my account of my meeting with Mr. Chillip , and of his holding her in such dread remembrance ; and both she and Peggotty had a great deal to say about my poor mother ’s second husband , and ‘
421436	421439	421421	421422	Mr. Micawber	341	‘ pecuniary liabilities ’
421636	421642	421644	421645	my aunt	731	‘ And when , Trot , ’
421665	421674	421644	421645	my aunt	731	‘ when are you going over to Canterbury ? ’
421675	421697	421707	421707	her	731	‘ I shall get a horse , and ride over tomorrow morning , aunt , unless you will go with me ? ’
421698	421701	421707	421707	her	731	‘ No ! ’
421712	421721	421707	421707	her	731	‘ I mean to stay where I am . ’
421759	421773	421752	421752	She	731	‘ Tut , Trot ; MY old bones would have kept till tomorrow ! ’
421850	421855	421856	421856	I	0	‘ Oh , Trot , ’
421877	421931	421932	421932	You	0	’ We both kept silence for some minutes . When I raised my eyes , I found that she was steadily observant of me . Perhaps she had followed the current of my mind ; for it seemed to me an easy one to track now , wilful as it had been once . ‘
421944	421949	421937	421942	a white - haired old man	8052	’ said my aunt , ‘

422017	422020	421967	421967	him	8052	’ said I. ‘
422026	422031	422024	422024	her	731	’ pursued my aunt , ‘
422065	422090	422058	422058	I	0	’ There was no higher praise for her ; no higher reproach for me . Oh , how had I strayed so far away ! ‘
422108	422124	422106	422106	herself	731	’ said my aunt , earnest even to the filling of her eyes with tears , ‘
422155	422156	422140	422140	she	731	’ ‘
422160	422170	422140	422140	she	731	’ I was thinking aloud , rather than speaking . ‘
422178	422185	422186	422187	Any lover	8057	’ said my aunt , sharply . ‘
422189	422192	422186	422187	Any lover	8057	’ said I. ‘
422196	422208	422186	422187	Any lover	8057	’ cried my aunt , with a kind of indignant pride . ‘
422225	422226	422186	422187	Any lover	8057	’ ‘
422230	422233	422186	422187	Any lover	8057	’ said I. ‘
422255	422282	422248	422248	Agnes	375	’ My aunt sat musing for a little while , with her chin upon her hand . Slowly raising her eyes to mine , she said : ‘
422292	422293	422285	422285	she	375	’ ‘
422298	422301	422302	422302	Trot	370	’ said I. ‘
422304	422310	422302	422302	Trot	370	’ returned my aunt gravely , ‘
422340	422400	422336	422336	I	0	’ She looked so attentively and anxiously at me ( I even saw her tremble ) , that I felt now , more than ever , that she had followed my late thoughts . I summoned all the resolutions I had made , in all those many days and nights , and all those many conflicts of my heart . ‘
422407	422411	422413	422413	I	0	’ I began , ‘

422471	422475	422476	422476	Agnes	375	’ I repeated , ‘
422507	423104	423105	423105	Agnes	375	’ My aunt withdrew her eyes from mine , as slowly as she had turned them upon me ; and covered them thoughtfully with her hand . By and by she put her other hand on my shoulder ; and so we both sat , looking into the past , without saying another word , until we parted for the night . I rode away , early in the morning , for the scene of my old school - days . I can not say that I was yet quite happy , in the hope that I was gaining a victory over myself ; even in the prospect of so soon looking on her face again . The well - remembered ground was soon traversed , and I came into the quiet streets , where every stone was a boy ’s book to me . I went on foot to the old house , and went away with a heart too full to enter . I returned ; and looking , as I passed , through the low window of the turret - room where first Uriah Heep , and afterwards Mr. Micawber , had been wo nt to sit , saw that it was a little parlour now , and that there was no office . Otherwise the staid old house was , as to its cleanliness and order , still just as it had been when I first saw it . I requested the new maid who admitted me , to tell Miss Wickfield that a gentleman who waited on her from a friend abroad , was there ; and I was shown up the grave old staircase ( cautioned of the steps I knew so well ) , into the unchanged drawing - room . The books that Agnes and I had read together , were on their shelves ; and the desk where I had laboured at my lessons , many a night , stood yet at the same old corner of the table . All the little changes that had crept in when the Heeps were there , were changed again . Everything was as it used to be , in the happy time . I stood in a window , and looked across the ancient street at the opposite houses , recalling how I had watched them on wet afternoons , when I first came there ; and how I had used to speculate about the people who appeared at any of the windows , and had followed them with my eyes up and down stairs , while women went clicking along the pavement in pattens , and the dull rain fell in slanting lines , and poured out of the water - spout yonder , and flowed into the road . The feeling with which I used to watch the tramps , as they came into the town on those wet evenings , at dusk , and limped past , with their bundles drooping over their shoulders at the ends of sticks , came freshly back to me ; fraught , as then , with the smell of damp earth , and wet leaves and briar , and the sensation of the very airs that blew upon me in my own toilsome journey . The opening of the little door in the panelled wall made me start and turn . Her beautiful serene eyes met mine as she came towards me . She stopped and laid her hand upon her bosom , and I caught her in my arms . ‘
423119	423120	423111	423111	I	0	’ ‘
423135	423136	423133	423133	Trotwood	228	’ ‘
423153	423409	423133	423133	Trotwood	228	’ I folded her to my heart , and , for a little while , we were both silent . Presently we sat down , side by side ; and her angel - face was turned upon me with the welcome I had dreamed of , waking and sleeping , for whole years . She was so true , she was so beautiful , she was so good,--I owed her so much gratitude , she was so dear to me , that I could find no utterance for what I felt . I tried to bless her , tried to thank her , tried to tell her ( as I had often done in letters ) what an influence she had upon me ; but all my efforts were in vain . My love and joy were dumb . With her own sweet tranquillity , she calmed my agitation ; led me back to the time of our parting ; spoke to me of Emily , whom she had visited , in secret , many times ; spoke to me tenderly of Dora ’s grave . With the unerring instinct of her noble heart , she touched the chords of my memory so softly and harmoniously , that not one jarred within me ; I could listen to the sorrowful , distant music , and desire to shrink from nothing it awoke . How could I , when , blended with it all , was her dear self , the better angel of my life ? ‘
423415	423423	423427	423427	yourself	8065	’ I said , by and by . ‘
423447	423448	423429	423429	You	8065	’ ‘
423454	423463	423464	423464	Papa	381	’ she answered , with her radiant smile . ‘
423502	423503	423506	423506	Agnes	375	’ ‘
423508	423524	423506	423506	Agnes	375	’ said I. She looked at me , with some fluttering wonder in her face . ‘
423532	423626	423530	423530	Sister	586	’ I said . Her colour , which had just now faded , returned , and faded again . She smiled ; with a quiet sadness , I thought ; and shook her head . I had sought to lead her to what my aunt had hinted at ; for , sharply painful to me as it must be to receive that confidence , I was to discipline my heart , and do my duty to her . I saw , however , that she was uneasy , and I let it pass . ‘
423636	423637	423530	423530	Sister	586	’ ‘
423642	423656	423530	423530	Sister	586	’ said she , looking up again , in all her bright composure . ‘
423667	423668	423634	423634	Agnes	375	’ ‘
423675	423679	423634	423634	Agnes	375	’ she returned , ‘
423694	423695	423634	423634	Agnes	375	’ ‘
423703	423731	423634	423634	Agnes	375	’ said I. Her colour came and went once more ; and once more , as she bent her head , I saw the same sad smile . ‘
423739	423745	423737	423737	papa	381	’ said Agnes , cheerfully , ‘
423768	423797	423762	423762	We	8071	’ I could not do that , having promised to ride back to my aunt ’s at night ; but I would pass the day there , joyfully . ‘
423808	423812	423762	423762	We	8071	’ said Agnes , ‘

423836	423843	423762	423762	We	8071	’ said I , looking round ; ‘

423857	423863	423851	423851	I	0	’ returned Agnes , smiling , ‘

423900	423903	423890	423890	I	0	’ said I. ‘
423916	423929	423890	423890	I	0	’ said Agnes , with her cordial eyes turned cheerfully upon me , ‘
423939	423957	423890	423890	I	0	’ showing me the basket - trifle , full of keys , still hanging at her side , ‘
423967	424310	423890	423890	I	0	’ She smiled again , and went out at the door by which she had come . It was for me to guard this sisterly affection with religious care . It was all that I had left myself , and it was a treasure . If I once shook the foundations of the sacred confidence and usage , in virtue of which it was given to me , it was lost , and could never be recovered . I set this steadily before myself . The better I loved her , the more it behoved me never to forget it . I walked through the streets ; and , once more seeing my old adversary the butcher -- now a constable , with his staff hanging up in the shop -- went down to look at the place where I had fought him ; and there meditated on Miss Shepherd and the eldest Miss Larkins , and all the idle loves and likings , and dislikings , of that time . Nothing seemed to have survived that time but Agnes ; and she , ever a star above me , was brighter and higher . When I returned , Mr. Wickfield had come home , from a garden he had , a couple of miles or so out of town , where he now employed himself almost every day . I found him as my aunt had described him . We sat down to dinner , with some half - dozen little girls ; and he seemed but the shadow of his handsome picture on the wall . The tranquillity and peace belonging , of old , to that quiet ground in my memory , pervaded it again . When dinner was done , Mr. Wickfield taking no wine , and I desiring none , we went up - stairs ; where Agnes and her little charges sang and played , and worked . After tea the children left us ; and we three sat together , talking of the bygone days . ‘
424316	424326	423890	423890	I	0	’ said Mr. Wickfield , shaking his white head , ‘
424361	424375	424348	424348	I	0	’ I could readily believe that , looking at the face beside him . ‘
424382	424386	424348	424348	I	0	’ he pursued , ‘

424452	424456	424432	424432	I	0	’ he returned , ‘
424478	424500	424475	424476	Dear Agnes	375	’ She had put her hand entreatingly on his arm , to stop him ; and was very , very pale . ‘
424505	424541	424475	424476	Dear Agnes	375	’ he said with a sigh , dismissing , as I then saw , some trial she had borne , or was yet to bear , in connexion with what my aunt had told me . ‘

424634	424649	424629	424629	He	999	’ Agnes leaned upon his shoulder , and stole her arm about his neck . ‘
424658	424662	424650	424650	She	8080	’ he said ; ‘
424759	424767	424768	424768	My	0	’ He kissed Agnes on her cheek . ‘
424889	424976	424883	424883	I	0	’ His bowed head , and her angel - face and filial duty , derived a more pathetic meaning from it than they had had before . If I had wanted anything by which to mark this night of our re - union , I should have found it in this . Agnes rose up from her father ’s side , before long ; and going softly to her piano , played some of the old airs to which we had often listened in that place . ‘
424986	424997	424978	424978	you	0	’ Agnes asked me , as I was standing by . ‘

425240	425258	425213	425213	you	375	’ She only shook her head ; through her tears I saw the same sad quiet smile . ‘
425404	425452	425396	425396	you	375	’ She put her hand in mine , and told me she was proud of me , and of what I said ; although I praised her very far beyond her worth . Then she went on softly playing , but without removing her eyes from me . ‘
425465	425469	425463	425463	Agnes	375	’ said I , ‘
425503	425504	425505	425505	You	0	’ ‘
425512	425519	425505	425505	You	0	’ she replied with a smile , ‘

425666	426412	425649	425649	you	375	’ For an instant , a distressful shadow crossed her face ; but , even in the start it gave me , it was gone ; and she was playing on , and looking at me with her own calm smile . As I rode back in the lonely night , the wind going by me like a restless memory , I thought of this , and feared she was not happy . I was not happy ; but , thus far , I had faithfully set the seal upon the Past , and , thinking of her , pointing upward , thought of her as pointing to that sky above me , where , in the mystery to come , I might yet love her with a love unknown on earth , and tell her what the strife had been within me when I loved her here . CHAPTER 61 . I AM SHOWN TWO INTERESTING PENITENTS For a time -- at all events until my book should be completed , which would be the work of several months -- I took up my abode in my aunt ’s house at Dover ; and there , sitting in the window from which I had looked out at the moon upon the sea , when that roof first gave me shelter , I quietly pursued my task . In pursuance of my intention of referring to my own fictions only when their course should incidentally connect itself with the progress of my story , I do not enter on the aspirations , the delights , anxieties , and triumphs of my art . That I truly devoted myself to it with my strongest earnestness , and bestowed upon it every energy of my soul , I have already said . If the books I have written be of any worth , they will supply the rest . I shall otherwise have written to poor purpose , and the rest will be of interest to no one . Occasionally , I went to London ; to lose myself in the swarm of life there , or to consult with Traddles on some business point . He had managed for me , in my absence , with the soundest judgement ; and my worldly affairs were prospering . As my notoriety began to bring upon me an enormous quantity of letters from people of whom I had no knowledge -- chiefly about nothing , and extremely difficult to answer -- I agreed with Traddles to have my name painted up on his door . There , the devoted postman on that beat delivered bushels of letters for me ; and there , at intervals , I laboured through them , like a Home Secretary of State without the salary . Among this correspondence , there dropped in , every now and then , an obliging proposal from one of the numerous outsiders always lurking about the Commons , to practise under cover of my name ( if I would take the necessary steps remaining to make a proctor of myself ) , and pay me a percentage on the profits . But I declined these offers ; being already aware that there were plenty of such covert practitioners in existence , and considering the Commons quite bad enough , without my doing anything to make it worse . The girls had gone home , when my name burst into bloom on Traddles ’s door ; and the sharp boy looked , all day , as if he had never heard of Sophy , shut up in a back room , glancing down from her work into a sooty little strip of garden with a pump in it . But there I always found her , the same bright housewife ; often humming her Devonshire ballads when no strange foot was coming up the stairs , and blunting the sharp boy in his official closet with melody . I wondered , at first , why I so often found Sophy writing in a copy - book ; and why she always shut it up when I appeared , and hurried it into the table - drawer . But the secret soon came out . One day , Traddles ( who had just come home through the drizzling sleet from Court ) took a paper out of his desk , and asked me what I thought of that handwriting ? ‘
426419	426432	426417	426417	Tom	306	’ cried Sophy , who was warming his slippers before the fire . ‘
426436	426445	426417	426417	Tom	306	’ returned Tom , in a delighted state , ‘
426459	426460	426451	426451	you	854	’ ‘
426468	426471	426472	426472	I	0	’ said I. ‘

426496	426500	426501	426502	A lady	8849	’ said Traddles . ‘
426505	426509	426501	426502	A lady	8849	’ I repeated . ‘
426521	426602	426603	426603	Tom	306	’ Traddles broke into a rapturous laugh , and informed me that it was Sophy ’s writing ; that Sophy had vowed and declared he would need a copying - clerk soon , and she would be that clerk ; that she had acquired this hand from a pattern ; and that she could throw off -- I forget how many folios an hour . Sophy was very much confused by my being told all this , and said that when ‘
426604	426620	426621	426621	Tom	306	’ was made a judge he would n’t be so ready to proclaim it . Which ‘
426622	426640	426603	426603	Tom	306	’ denied ; averring that he should always be equally proud of it , under all circumstances . ‘
426655	426667	426668	426668	My	0	’ said I , when she had gone away , laughing . ‘
426672	426676	426668	426668	My	0	’ returned Traddles , ‘

426722	426726	426715	426715	you	306	’ I returned . ‘

426765	426769	426770	426770	I	0	’ returned Traddles . ‘
426888	426916	426917	426917	I	0	’ He was tender of the very slippers she had been warming , as he put them on , and stretched his feet enjoyingly upon the fender . ‘
426925	426929	426917	426917	I	0	’ said Traddles . ‘
427013	427338	427004	427004	We	8125	’ shops ; and I show Sophy which of the diamond - eyed serpents , coiled up on white satin rising grounds , I would give her if I could afford it ; and Sophy shows me which of the gold watches that are capped and jewelled and engine - turned , and possessed of the horizontal lever - escape - movement , and all sorts of things , she would buy for me if she could afford it ; and we pick out the spoons and forks , fish - slices , butter - knives , and sugar - tongs , we should both prefer if we could both afford it ; and really we go away as if we had got them ! Then , when we stroll into the squares , and great streets , and see a house to let , sometimes we look up at it , and say , how would THAT do , if I was made a judge ? And we parcel it out -- such a room for us , such rooms for the girls , and so forth ; until we settle to our satisfaction that it would do , or it would n’t do , as the case may be . Sometimes , we go at half - price to the pit of the theatre -- the very smell of which is cheap , in my opinion , at the money -- and there we thoroughly enjoy the play : which Sophy believes every word of , and so do I. In walking home , perhaps we buy a little bit of something at a cook’s - shop , or a little lobster at the fishmongers , and bring it here , and make a splendid supper , chatting about what we have seen . Now , you know , Copperfield , if I was Lord Chancellor , we could n’t do this ! ’
427339	427353	427355	427355	I	0	‘ You would do something , whatever you were , my dear Traddles , ’
427357	427370	427371	427371	I	0	‘ that would be pleasant and amiable . And by the way , ’
427375	427385	427371	427371	I	0	‘ I suppose you never draw any skeletons now ? ’
427386	427389	427391	427391	Traddles	534	‘ Really , ’
427398	427471	427391	427391	Traddles	534	‘ I ca n’t wholly deny that I do , my dear Copperfield . For being in one of the back rows of the King ’s Bench the other day , with a pen in my hand , the fancy came into my head to try how I had preserved that accomplishment . And I am afraid there ’s a skeleton -- in a wig -- on the ledge of the desk . ’

427558	427561	427556	427556	Traddles	534	‘ No ! ’

427661	427666	427668	427668	Traddles	534	‘ Oh dear me ! ’
427670	427726	427668	427668	Traddles	534	‘ it would be very difficult to answer that question . Perhaps he voted for somebody , or lent money to somebody , or bought something of somebody , or otherwise obliged somebody , or jobbed for somebody , who knew somebody who got the lieutenant of the county to nominate him for the commission . ’
427727	427738	427740	427740	I.	0	‘ On the commission he is , at any rate , ’
427741	427797	427805	427805	Traddles	534	‘ And he writes to me here , that he will be glad to show me , in operation , the only true system of prison discipline ; the only unchallengeable way of making sincere and lasting converts and penitents -- which , you know , is by solitary confinement . What do you say ? ’
427798	427803	427805	427805	Traddles	534	‘ To the system ? ’
427810	427825	427668	427668	Traddles	534	‘ No . To my accepting the offer , and your going with me ? ’
427826	427832	427834	427834	Traddles	534	‘ I do n’t object , ’
427836	427880	427834	427834	Traddles	534	‘ Then I ’ll write to say so . You remember ( to say nothing of our treatment ) this same Creakle turning his son out of doors , I suppose , and the life he used to lead his wife and daughter ? ’
427881	427884	427886	427886	Traddles	534	‘ Perfectly , ’

I found a vast amount of profession , varying very little in character : varying very little ( which I thought exceedingly suspicious ) , even in words . I found a great many foxes , disparaging whole vineyards of inaccessible grapes ; but I found very few foxes whom I would have trusted within reach of a bunch . Above all , I found that the most professing men were the greatest objects of interest ; and that their conceit , their vanity , their want of excitement , and their love of deception ( which many of them possessed to an almost incredible extent , as their histories showed ) , all prompted to these professions , and were all gratified by them . However , I heard so repeatedly , in the course of our goings to and fro , of a certain Number Twenty Seven , who was the Favourite , and who really appeared to be a Model Prisoner , that I resolved to suspend my judgement until I should see Twenty Seven . Twenty Eight , I understood , was also a bright particular star ; but it was his misfortune to have his glory a little dimmed by the extraordinary lustre of Twenty Seven . I heard so much of Twenty Seven , of his pious admonitions to everybody around him , and of the beautiful letters he constantly wrote to his mother ( whom he seemed to consider in a very bad way ) , that I became quite impatient to see him . I had to restrain my impatience for some time , on account of Twenty Seven being reserved for a concluding effect . But , at last , we came to the door of his cell ; and Mr. Creakle , looking through a little hole in it , reported to us , in a state of the greatest admiration , that he was reading a Hymn Book . There was such a rush of heads immediately , to see Number Twenty Seven reading his Hymn Book , that the little hole was blocked up , six or seven heads deep . To remedy this inconvenience , and give us an opportunity of conversing with Twenty Seven in all his purity , Mr. Creakle directed the door of the cell to be unlocked , and Twenty Seven to be invited out into the passage . This was done ; and whom should Traddles and I then behold , to our amazement , in this converted Number Twenty Seven , but Uriah Heep ! He knew us directly ; and said , as he came out -- with the old writhe,-- ‘
429262	429292	429256	429256	you	8184	’ This recognition caused a general admiration in the party . I rather thought that everyone was struck by his not being proud , and taking notice of us . ‘
429298	429307	429295	429296	Twenty Seven	656	’ said Mr. Creakle , mournfully admiring him . ‘

429369	429379	429365	429365	you	979	’ said Uriah Heep , looking in that direction . ‘
429407	429430	429391	429391	I	0	’ Several gentlemen were much affected ; and a third questioner , forcing himself to the front , inquired with extreme feeling : ‘

429445	429458	429441	429441	you	979	’ replied Uriah , glancing in the new direction of this voice , ‘

429505	429633	429634	429635	Twenty Eight	657	’ A murmur , partly of gratification at Twenty Seven ’s celestial state of mind , and partly of indignation against the Contractor who had given him any cause of complaint ( a note of which was immediately made by Mr. Creakle ) , having subsided , Twenty Seven stood in the midst of us , as if he felt himself the principal object of merit in a highly meritorious museum . That we , the neophytes , might have an excess of light shining upon us all at once , orders were given to let out Twenty Eight . I had been so much astonished already , that I only felt a kind of resigned wonder when Mr. Littimer walked forth , reading a good book ! ‘
429637	429650	429634	429635	Twenty Eight	657	’ said a gentleman in spectacles , who had not yet spoken , ‘

430055	430080	430083	430083	you	979	’ I observed that several gentlemen were shading their eyes , each with one hand , as if they had just come into church . ‘

430442	430457	430437	430437	she	10856	’ Somebody incautiously asked , what from ? But there was a scandalized whisper of ‘

430467	430479	430465	430465	sir	979	’ returned Uriah , writhing in the direction of the voice . ‘
430533	430553	430510	430510	mother	10856	’ This sentiment gave unbounded satisfaction -- greater satisfaction , I think , than anything that had passed yet . ‘
430559	430587	430510	430510	mother	10856	’ said Uriah , stealing a look at us , as if he would have blighted the outer world to which we belonged , if he could , ‘

430811	430822	430799	430799	you	0	’ General commiseration . Several indignant glances directed at me . ‘
430831	430855	430824	430824	I	0	’ said Uriah , making his forgiving nature the subject of a most impious and awful parallel , which I shall not record . ‘
431002	431107	430993	430993	I	0	’ He sneaked back into his cell , amidst a little chorus of approbation ; and both Traddles and I experienced a great relief when he was locked in . It was a characteristic feature in this repentance , that I was fain to ask what these two men had done , to be there at all . That appeared to be the last thing about which they had anything to say . I addressed myself to one of the two warders , who , I suspected from certain latent indications in their faces , knew pretty well what all this stir was worth . ‘

431765	431775	431777	431777	I	0	‘ Perhaps it ’s a good thing , Traddles , ’

432221	432245	432218	432218	I	0	‘ Agnes , so it was when I came home ; and now I am old , and I never have loved since ! ’

432684	432712	432681	432682	my aunt	731	‘ but at present he is holding down his head and his ears , standing before the door there , as if he thought his stable preferable . ’

432750	432763	432765	432766	my aunt	731	‘ The ride will do his master good , at all events , ’
432776	432808	432765	432766	my aunt	731	‘ Ah , child , you pass a good many hours here ! I never thought , when I used to read books , what work it was to write them . ’
432809	432820	432821	432821	I	0	‘ It ’s work enough to read them , sometimes , ’
432824	432838	432821	432821	I	0	‘ As to the writing , it has its own charms , aunt . ’
432839	432845	432847	432848	my aunt	731	‘ Ah ! I see ! ’
432850	432873	432847	432848	my aunt	731	‘ Ambition , love of approbation , sympathy , and much more , I suppose ? Well : go along with you ! ’
432874	432881	432883	432883	I	0	‘ Do you know anything more , ’
432909	432923	432890	432890	she	731	’ She looked up in my face a little while , before replying : ‘
432931	432932	432929	432929	Trot	370	’ ‘
432940	432944	432934	432934	you	731	’ I inquired . ‘
432952	432989	432950	432950	Trot	370	’ She looked so steadfastly at me : with a kind of doubt , or pity , or suspense in her affection : that I summoned the stronger determination to show her a perfectly cheerful face . ‘
432996	433001	432995	432995	Trot--	659	’ said my aunt . ‘
433004	433005	432995	432995	Trot--	659	’ ‘

433032	433037	433030	433030	her	375	’ said my aunt , ‘
433043	433319	433030	433030	her	375	’ I echoed it , parted from my aunt , and went lightly downstairs , mounted , and rode away . There was greater reason than before to do what I had resolved to do . How well I recollect the wintry ride ! The frozen particles of ice , brushed from the blades of grass by the wind , and borne across my face ; the hard clatter of the horse ’s hoofs , beating a tune upon the ground ; the stiff - tilled soil ; the snowdrift , lightly eddying in the chalk - pit as the breeze ruffled it ; the smoking team with the waggon of old hay , stopping to breathe on the hill - top , and shaking their bells musically ; the whitened slopes and sweeps of Down - land lying against the dark sky , as if they were drawn on a huge slate ! I found Agnes alone . The little girls had gone to their own homes now , and she was alone by the fire , reading . She put down her book on seeing me come in ; and having welcomed me as usual , took her work - basket and sat in one of the old - fashioned windows . I sat beside her on the window - seat , and we talked of what I was doing , and when it would be done , and of the progress I had made since my last visit . Agnes was very cheerful ; and laughingly predicted that I should soon become too famous to be talked to , on such subjects . ‘
433333	433337	433321	433321	I	0	’ said Agnes , ‘
433346	433376	433377	433377	You	8283	’ As I looked at her beautiful face , observant of her work , she raised her mild clear eyes , and saw that I was looking at her . ‘
433384	433385	433382	433382	Trotwood	228	’ ‘
433401	433428	433395	433395	I	0	’ She put aside her work , as she was used to do when we were seriously discussing anything ; and gave me her whole attention . ‘
433442	433443	433434	433434	you	375	’ ‘
433446	433456	433458	433458	you	375	’ she answered , with a look of astonishment . ‘

433474	433481	433463	433463	I	0	’ she answered , as before . ‘

433551	433561	433549	433549	Agnes	375	’ She cast down her eyes , and trembled . ‘
433653	433747	433748	433748	Agnes	375	’ With an appealing , almost a reproachful , glance , she rose from the window ; and hurrying across the room as if without knowing where , put her hands before her face , and burst into such tears as smote me to the heart . And yet they awakened something in me , bringing promise to my heart . Without my knowing why , these tears allied themselves with the quietly sad smile which was so fixed in my remembrance , and shook me more with hope than fear or sorrow . ‘
433759	433760	433756	433756	I	0	’ ‘
433809	433851	433852	433852	Agnes	375	’ I sought to recollect what she had said , when I had spoken to her on that former night , of her affection needing no return . It seemed a very world that I must search through in a moment . ‘
433947	433948	433938	433938	Agnes	375	’ ‘
433962	434004	434005	434005	I	0	’ was all I could distinguish . Was it a selfish error that was leading me away ? Or , having once a clue to hope , was there something opening to me that I had not dared to think of ? ‘
434142	434177	434178	434178	I	0	’ She was quiet now . In a little time , she turned her pale face towards me , and said in a low voice , broken here and there , but very clear : ‘

434317	434336	434310	434310	Agnes	375	’ She was going away , but I detained her . I clasped my arm about her waist . ‘

434352	434373	434310	434310	Agnes	375	’ New thoughts and hopes were whirling through my mind , and all the colours of my life were changing . ‘
434455	434481	434482	434482	Agnes	375	’ Her tears fell fast ; but they were not like those she had lately shed , and I saw my hope brighten in them . ‘
434580	434611	434613	434613	I	0	’ Still weeping , but not sadly -- joyfully ! And clasped in my arms as she had never been , as I had thought she never was to be ! ‘

434744	434949	434950	434950	I	0	’ And now , I tried to tell her of the struggle I had had , and the conclusion I had come to . I tried to lay my mind before her , truly , and entirely . I tried to show her how I had hoped I had come into the better knowledge of myself and of her ; how I had resigned myself to what that better knowledge brought ; and how I had come there , even that day , in my fidelity to this . If she did so love me ( I said ) that she could take me for her husband , she could do so , on no deserving of mine , except upon the truth of my love for her , and the trouble in which it had ripened to be what it was ; and hence it was that I revealed it . And O , Agnes , even out of thy true eyes , in that same time , the spirit of my child - wife looked upon me , saying it was well ; and winning me , through thee , to tenderest recollections of the Blossom that had withered in its bloom ! ‘

Our tears were not for the trials ( hers so much the greater ) through which we had come to be thus , but for the rapture of being thus , never to be divided more ! We walked , that winter evening , in the fields together ; and the blessed calm within us seemed to be partaken by the frosty air . The early stars began to shine while we were lingering on , and looking up to them , we thanked our GOD for having guided us to this tranquillity . We stood together in the same old - fashioned window at night , when the moon was shining ; Agnes with her quiet eyes raised up to it ; I following her glance . Long miles of road then opened out before my mind ; and , toiling on , I saw a ragged way - worn boy , forsaken and neglected , who should come to call even the heart now beating against mine , his own . It was nearly dinner - time next day when we appeared before my aunt . She was up in my study , Peggotty said : which it was her pride to keep in readiness and order for me . We found her , in her spectacles , sitting by the fire . ‘

We all do that , all the colony over . He ’d got an old newspaper with him , and some other account in print of the storm . That ’s how she know’d it . When I came home at night , I found she know’d it . ’

437937	437988	437934	437935	Mrs. Gummidge	267	’ I suggested . It was a pleasant key to touch , for Mr. Peggotty suddenly burst into a roar of laughter , and rubbed his hands up and down his legs , as he had been accustomed to do when he enjoyed himself in the long - shipwrecked boat . ‘
437994	437998	437990	437990	you	267	’ he said . ‘

438599	438626	438594	438595	A Magistrate	9389	’ said I. Mr. Peggotty pointed to a certain paragraph in the newspaper , where I read aloud as follows , from the Port Middlebay Times : ‘
439105	439193	439103	439104	Mrs. MICAWBER	342	’S FAMILY ( well known , it is needless to remark , in the mother - country ) , & amp;c . & amp;c . & amp;c . At the conclusion of the proceedings the tables were cleared as if by art - magic for dancing . Among the votaries of TERPSICHORE , who disported themselves until Sol gave warning for departure , Wilkins Micawber , Esquire , Junior , and the lovely and accomplished Miss Helena , fourth daughter of Doctor Mell , were particularly remarkable . ’
439251	439258	439247	439247	I	0	‘ TO DAVID COPPERFIELD , ESQUIRE , ‘
439263	439268	439228	439229	Mr. Peggotty	234	‘ My Dear Sir , ‘

439567	439632	439501	439501	your	854	’ I found , on glancing at the remaining contents of the newspaper , that Mr. Micawber was a diligent and esteemed correspondent of that journal . There was another letter from him in the same paper , touching a bridge ; there was an advertisement of a collection of similar letters by him , to be shortly republished , in a neat volume , ‘
439636	439793	439795	439795	Em’ly	8415	’ ; and , unless I am very much mistaken , the Leading Article was his also . We talked much of Mr. Micawber , on many other evenings while Mr. Peggotty remained with us . He lived with us during the whole term of his stay,--which , I think , was something less than a month,--and his sister and my aunt came to London to see him . Agnes and I parted from him aboard - ship , when he sailed ; and we shall never part from him more , on earth . But before he left , he went with me to Yarmouth , to see a little tablet I had put up in the churchyard to the memory of Ham . While I was copying the plain inscription for him at his request , I saw him stoop , and gather a tuft of grass from the grave and a little earth . ‘
439797	439809	439810	439810	I	0	’ he said , as he put it in his breast . ‘
439816	440313	439813	439814	Mas’r Davy	256	’ CHAPTER 64 . A LAST RETROSPECT And now my written story ends . I look back , once more -- for the last time -- before I close these leaves . I see myself , with Agnes at my side , journeying along the road of life . I see our children and our friends around us ; and I hear the roar of many voices , not indifferent to me as I travel on . What faces are the most distinct to me in the fleeting crowd ? Lo , these ; all turning to me as I ask my thoughts the question ! Here is my aunt , in stronger spectacles , an old woman of four - score years and more , but upright yet , and a steady walker of six miles at a stretch in winter weather . Always with her , here comes Peggotty , my good old nurse , likewise in spectacles , accustomed to do needle - work at night very close to the lamp , but never sitting down to it without a bit of wax candle , a yard - measure in a little house , and a work - box with a picture of St. Paul ’s upon the lid . The cheeks and arms of Peggotty , so hard and red in my childish days , when I wondered why the birds did n’t peck her in preference to apples , are shrivelled now ; and her eyes , that used to darken their whole neighbourhood in her face , are fainter ( though they glitter still ) ; but her rough forefinger , which I once associated with a pocket nutmeg - grater , is just the same , and when I see my least child catching at it as it totters from my aunt to her , I think of our little parlour at home , when I could scarcely walk . My aunt ’s old disappointment is set right , now . She is godmother to a real living Betsey Trotwood ; and Dora ( the next in order ) says she spoils her . There is something bulky in Peggotty ’s pocket . It is nothing smaller than the Crocodile Book , which is in rather a dilapidated condition by this time , with divers of the leaves torn and stitched across , but which Peggotty exhibits to the children as a precious relic . I find it very curious to see my own infant face , looking up at me from the Crocodile stories ; and to be reminded by it of my old acquaintance Brooks of Sheffield . Among my boys , this summer holiday time , I see an old man making giant kites , and gazing at them in the air , with a delight for which there are no words . He greets me rapturously , and whispers , with many nods and winks , ‘
440351	440428	440429	440429	Rosa	418	’ Who is this bent lady , supporting herself by a stick , and showing me a countenance in which there are some traces of old pride and beauty , feebly contending with a querulous , imbecile , fretful wandering of the mind ? She is in a garden ; and near her stands a sharp , dark , withered woman , with a white scar on her lip . Let me hear what they say . ‘
440439	440450	440431	440431	I	0	’ Rosa bends over her , and calls to her , ‘

440529	440556	440557	440557	Rosa	418	’ Looking fixedly at me , she puts her hand to her forehead , and moans . Suddenly , she cries , in a terrible voice , ‘
440567	440589	440557	440557	Rosa	418	’ Rosa kneeling at her feet , by turns caresses her , and quarrels with her ; now fiercely telling her , ‘

440867	440871	440830	440830	Julia	525	‘ so charmingly antique ’

441214	441314	441202	441202	Traddles	534	‘ I really have been able , my dear Copperfield , to do all that I had most at heart . There ’s the Reverend Horace promoted to that living at four hundred and fifty pounds a year ; there are our two boys receiving the very best education , and distinguishing themselves as steady scholars and good fellows ; there are three of the girls married very comfortably ; there are three more living with us ; there are three more keeping house for the Reverend Horace since Mrs. Crewler ’s decease ; and all of them happy . ’
