6046	6402	6042	6043	Captain Brown	80	“ The Honourable Mrs Jamieson has only just quitted me ; and , in the course of conversation , she communicated to me the intelligence that she had yesterday received a call from her revered husband ’s quondam friend , Lord Mauleverer . You will not easily conjecture what brought his lordship within the precincts of our little town . It was to see Captain Brown , with whom , it appears , his lordship was acquainted in the ‘ plumed wars , ’ and who had the privilege of averting destruction from his lordship ’s head when some great peril was impending over it , off the misnomered Cape of Good Hope . You know our friend the Honourable Mrs Jamieson ’s deficiency in the spirit of innocent curiosity , and you will therefore not be so much surprised when I tell you she was quite unable to disclose to me the exact nature of the peril in question . I was anxious , I confess , to ascertain in what manner Captain Brown , with his limited establishment , could receive so distinguished a guest ; and I discovered that his lordship retired to rest , and , let us hope , to refreshing slumbers , at the Angel Hotel ; but shared the Brunonian meals during the two days that he honoured Cranford with his august presence . Mrs Johnson , our civil butcher ’s wife , informs me that Miss Jessie purchased a leg of lamb ; but , besides this , I can hear of no preparation whatever to give a suitable reception to so distinguished a visitor . Perhaps they entertained him with ‘ the feast of reason and the flow of soul ’ ; and to us , who are acquainted with Captain Brown ’s sad want of relish for ‘ the pure wells of English undefiled , ’ it may be matter for congratulation that he has had the opportunity of improving his taste by holding converse with an elegant and refined member of the British aristocracy . But from some mundane failings who is altogether free ? ”

7136	7232	7130	7131	Miss Matty	98	“ To see her way of bearing with Miss Brown ’s crossness , and the bright face she puts on after she ’s been sitting up a whole night and scolded above half of it , is quite beautiful . Yet she looks as neat and as ready to welcome the Captain at breakfast - time as if she had been asleep in the Queen ’s bed all night . My dear ! you could never laugh at her prim little curls or her pink bows again if you saw her as I have done . ”
7301	7388	7298	7298	she	85	“ But , to be sure , what a town Cranford is for kindness ! I do n’t suppose any one has a better dinner than usual cooked but the best part of all comes in a little covered basin for my sister . The poor people will leave their earliest vegetables at our door for her . They speak short and gruff , as if they were ashamed of it : but I am sure it often goes to my heart to see their thoughtfulness . ”
7422	7440	7442	7442	I.	519	“ But why does not this Lord Mauleverer do something for the man who saved his life ? ”
7443	7539	7442	7442	I.	519	“ Why , you see , unless Captain Brown has some reason for it , he never speaks about being poor ; and he walked along by his lordship looking as happy and cheerful as a prince ; and as they never called attention to their dinner by apologies , and as Miss Brown was better that day , and all seemed bright , I daresay his lordship never knew how much care there was in the background . He did send game in the winter pretty often , but now he is gone abroad . ”
7795	7807	7792	7792	he	80	“ What Jessie has been to us , God only knows ! ”
7886	7908	7910	7910	she	104	“ Oh , ma’am ! Oh , Miss Jenkyns , ma’am ! Captain Brown is killed by them nasty cruel railroads ! ”

8059	8073	8075	8075	he	535	“ Please , mum , it is true . I seed it myself , ”
8081	8240	8075	8075	he	535	“ The Captain was a - reading some new book as he was deep in , a - waiting for the down train ; and there was a little lass as wanted to come to its mammy , and gave its sister the slip , and came toddling across the line . And he looked up sudden , at the sound of the train coming , and seed the child , and he darted on the line and cotched it up , and his foot slipped , and the train came over him in no time . O Lord , Lord ! Mum , it ’s quite true , and they ’ve come over to tell his daughters . The child ’s safe , though , with only a bang on its shoulder as he threw it to its mammy . Poor Captain would be glad of that , mum , would n’t he ? God bless him ! ”

9586	9681	9581	9582	Miss Jessie	85	“ And my father , my dear , dear father ! I will not complain now , if God will give me strength to be patient . But , oh , Jessie ! tell my father how I longed and yearned to see him at last , and to ask his forgiveness . He can never know now how I loved him — oh ! if I might but tell him , before I die ! What a life of sorrow his has been , and I have done so little to cheer him ! ”

Then we had suet puddings , boiled in the broth with the beef : and then the meat itself . If we did not sup our broth , we had no ball , which we liked a deal better ; and the beef came last of all , and only those had it who had done justice to the broth and the ball . Now folks begin with sweet things , and turn their dinners topsy - turvy . ”

Many a girl as I know would have ’em unbeknownst to missus ; but I ’ve given my word , and I ’ll stick to it ; or else this is just the house for missus never to be the wiser if they did come : and it ’s such a capable kitchen — there ’s such dark corners in it — I’d be bound to hide any one . I counted up last Sunday night — for I ’ll not deny I was crying because I had to shut the door in Jem Hearn ’s face , and he ’s a steady young man , fit for any girl ; only I had given missus my word . ”

Poor Thomas ! that journey to Paris was quite too much for him . His housekeeper says he has hardly ever been round his fields since , but just sits with his hands on his knees in the counting - house , not reading or anything , but only saying what a wonderful city Paris was ! Paris has much to answer for if it ’s killed my cousin Thomas , for a better man never lived . ”

Many people talked of hiding themselves in the salt mines — and meat would have kept capitally down there , only perhaps we should have been thirsty . And my father preached a whole set of sermons on the occasion ; one set in the mornings , all about David and Goliath , to spirit up the people to fighting with spades or bricks , if need were ; and the other set in the afternoons , proving that Napoleon ( that was another name for Bony , as we used to call him ) was all the same as an Apollyon and Abaddon .

25975	26525	25896	25896	she	98	“ No ! it was not the Latin . Peter was in high favour with my father , for he worked up well for him . But he seemed to think that the Cranford people might be joked about , and made fun of , and they did not like it ; nobody does . He was always hoaxing them ; ‘ hoaxing ’ is not a pretty word , my dear , and I hope you wo n’t tell your father I used it , for I should not like him to think that I was not choice in my language , after living with such a woman as Deborah . And be sure you never use it yourself . I do n’t know how it slipped out of my mouth , except it was that I was thinking of poor Peter and it was always his expression . But he was a very gentlemanly boy in many things . He was like dear Captain Brown in always being ready to help any old person or a child . Still , he did like joking and making fun ; and he seemed to think the old ladies in Cranford would believe anything . There were many old ladies living here then ; we are principally ladies now , I know , but we are not so old as the ladies used to be when I was a girl . I could laugh to think of some of Peter ’s jokes . No , my dear , I wo n’t tell you of them , because they might not shock you as they ought to do , and they were very shocking . He even took in my father once , by dressing himself up as a lady that was passing through the town and wished to see the Rector of Cranford , ‘ who had published that admirable Assize Sermon . ’ Peter said he was awfully frightened himself when he saw how my father took it all in , and even offered to copy out all his Napoleon Buonaparte sermons for her — him , I mean — no , her , for Peter was a lady then . He told me he was more terrified than he ever was before , all the time my father was speaking . He did not think my father would have believed him ; and yet if he had not , it would have been a sad thing for Peter . As it was , he was none so glad of it , for my father kept him hard at work copying out all those twelve Buonaparte sermons for the lady — that was for Peter himself , you know . He was the lady . And once when he wanted to go fishing , Peter said , ‘ Confound the woman!’—very bad language , my dear , but Peter was not always so guarded as he should have been ; my father was so angry with him , it nearly frightened me out of my wits : and yet I could hardly keep from laughing at the little curtseys Peter kept making , quite slyly , whenever my father spoke of the lady ’s excellent taste and sound discrimination . ”

26545	26674	26544	26544	I.	975	“ Oh , no ! Deborah would have been too much shocked . No , no one knew but me . I wish I had always known of Peter ’s plans ; but sometimes he did not tell me . He used to say the old ladies in the town wanted something to talk about ; but I do n’t think they did . They had the _ St James ’s Chronicle _ three times a week , just as we have now , and we have plenty to say ; and I remember the clacking noise there always was when some of the ladies got together . But , probably , schoolboys talk more than ladies . At last there was a terrible , sad thing happened . ”

26747	26768	26769	26770	Miss Matty	98	“ No , ma’am , not at all ; Jem Hearn will be only too proud to go with me . ”
26792	26946	26783	26783	she	98	“ We ’ll put out the candle , my dear . We can talk just as well by firelight , you know . There ! Well , you see , Deborah had gone from home for a fortnight or so ; it was a very still , quiet day , I remember , overhead ; and the lilacs were all in flower , so I suppose it was spring . My father had gone out to see some sick people in the parish ; I recollect seeing him leave the house with his wig and shovel - hat and cane . What possessed our poor Peter I do n’t know ; he had the sweetest temper , and yet he always seemed to like to plague Deborah . She never laughed at his jokes , and thought him ungenteel , and not careful enough about improving his mind ; and that vexed him . “
27460	27828	27451	27451	he	2082	“ My dear , that boy ’s trick , on that sunny day , when all seemed going straight and well , broke my mother ’s heart , and changed my father for life . It did , indeed . Old Clare said , Peter looked as white as my father ; and stood as still as a statue to be flogged ; and my father struck hard ! When my father stopped to take breath , Peter said , ‘ Have you done enough , sir ? ’ quite hoarsely , and still standing quite quiet . I do n’t know what my father said — or if he said anything . But old Clare said , Peter turned to where the people outside the railing were , and made them a low bow , as grand and as grave as any gentleman ; and then walked slowly into the house . I was in the store - room helping my mother to make cowslip wine . I can not abide the wine now , nor the scent of the flowers ; they turn me sick and faint , as they did that day , when Peter came in , looking as haughty as any man — indeed , looking like a man , not like a boy . ‘ Mother ! ’ he said , ‘ I am come to say , God bless you for ever . ’ I saw his lips quiver as he spoke ; and I think he durst not say anything more loving , for the purpose that was in his heart . She looked at him rather frightened , and wondering , and asked him what was to do . He did not smile or speak , but put his arms round her and kissed her as if he did not know how to leave off ; and before she could speak again , he was gone . We talked it over , and could not understand it , and she bade me go and seek my father , and ask what it was all about . I found him walking up and down , looking very highly displeased . “
27846	27921	27923	27923	my	0	“ I durst not ask any more questions . When I told my mother , she sat down , quite faint , for a minute . I remember , a few days after , I saw the poor , withered cowslip flowers thrown out to the leaf heap , to decay and die there . There was no making of cowslip wine that year at the rectory — nor , indeed , ever after . “
28390	28599	28380	28380	she	2400	“ ‘ Molly ! ’ said he , ‘ I did not think all this would happen . ’ He looked into her face for comfort — her poor face all wild and white ; for neither she nor my father had dared to acknowledge — much less act upon — the terror that was in their hearts , lest Peter should have made away with himself . My father saw no conscious look in his wife ’s hot , dreary eyes , and he missed the sympathy that she had always been ready to give him — strong man as he was , and at the dumb despair in her face his tears began to flow . But when she saw this , a gentle sorrow came over her countenance , and she said , ‘ Dearest John ! do n’t cry ; come with me , and we ’ll find him , ’ almost as cheerfully as if she knew where he was . And she took my father ’s great hand in her little soft one , and led him along , the tears dropping as he walked on that same unceasing , weary walk , from room to room , through house and garden . “
28840	28870	28832	28833	old Clare	152	“ ‘ I have borrowed the nets from the weir , Miss Matty . Shall we drag the ponds to - night , or wait for the morning ? ’ “
28923	29036	28918	28918	my	0	“ The next day Deborah was at home before I was myself again . She would not have been so weak as to give way as I had done ; but my screams ( my horrible laughter had ended in crying ) had roused my sweet dear mother , whose poor wandering wits were called back and collected as soon as a child needed her care . She and Deborah sat by my bedside ; I knew by the looks of each that there had been no news of Peter — no awful , ghastly news , which was what I most had dreaded in my dull state between sleeping and waking . “
29147	29148	29151	29152	Mr Peter	157	” “
29154	29157	29158	29158	He	157	” said I. “
29238	29320	29321	29322	MY DEAREST	2303	” We lighted the candle , and found the captain ’s letter and Peter ’s too . And we also found a little simple begging letter from Mrs Jenkyns to Peter , addressed to him at the house of an old schoolfellow whither she fancied he might have gone . They had returned it unopened ; and unopened it had remained ever since , having been inadvertently put by among the other letters of that time . This is it : — “
29444	29566	29437	29437	I	0	” But Peter did not come back . That spring day was the last time he ever saw his mother ’s face . The writer of the letter — the last — the only person who had ever seen what was written in it , was dead long ago ; and I , a stranger , not born at the time when this occurrence took place , was the one to open it . The captain ’s letter summoned the father and mother to Liverpool instantly , if they wished to see their boy ; and , by some of the wild chances of life , the captain ’s letter had been detained somewhere , somehow . Miss Matty went on , “
29624	29676	29677	29677	Mother	153	” It was full of love , and sorrow , and pride in his new profession , and a sore sense of his disgrace in the eyes of the people at Cranford ; but ending with a passionate entreaty that she would come and see him before he left the Mersey : “
29705	29706	29696	29696	I	0	” “
29713	29718	29708	29708	she	2400	” said Miss Matty ; “
29722	29755	29708	29708	she	2400	” We sat in silence , pondering on the full meaning of those sad , sad words . At length I asked Miss Matty to tell me how her mother bore it . “
29758	29762	29763	29763	she	2400	” she said , “
29910	30233	29904	29904	him	2082	“ But , you see , he saw what we did not — that it was killing my mother . Yes ! killing her ( put out the candle , my dear ; I can talk better in the dark ) , for she was but a frail woman , and ill - fitted to stand the fright and shock she had gone through ; and she would smile at him and comfort him , not in words , but in her looks and tones , which were always cheerful when he was there . And she would speak of how she thought Peter stood a good chance of being admiral very soon — he was so brave and clever ; and how she thought of seeing him in his navy uniform , and what sort of hats admirals wore ; and how much more fit he was to be a sailor than a clergyman ; and all in that way , just to make my father think she was quite glad of what came of that unlucky morning ’s work , and the flogging which was always in his mind , as we all knew . But oh , my dear ! the bitter , bitter crying she had when she was alone ; and at last , as she grew weaker , she could not keep her tears in when Deborah or me was by , and would give us message after message for Peter ( his ship had gone to the Mediterranean , or somewhere down there , and then he was ordered off to India , and there was no overland route then ) ; but she still said that no one knew where their death lay in wait , and that we were not to think hers was near . We did not think it , but we knew it , as we saw her fading away . “
30261	30334	30335	30335	We	1087	“ And only think , love ! the very day after her death — for she did not live quite a twelvemonth after Peter went away — the very day after — came a parcel for her from India — from her poor boy . It was a large , soft , white Indian shawl , with just a little narrow border all round ; just what my mother would have liked . “
30442	30528	30424	30424	he	2082	“ Well , perhaps it was not reasonable , but what could we do or say ? One gives people in grief their own way . He took it up and felt it : ‘ It is just such a shawl as she wished for when she was married , and her mother did not give it her . I did not know of it till after , or she should have had it — she should ; but she shall have it now . ’ “
30634	30856	30617	30620	old Clare ’s wife	1093	“ Deborah said to me , the day of my mother ’s funeral , that if she had a hundred offers she never would marry and leave my father . It was not very likely she would have so many — I do n’t know that she had one ; but it was not less to her credit to say so . She was such a daughter to my father as I think there never was before or since . His eyes failed him , and she read book after book , and wrote , and copied , and was always at his service in any parish business . She could do many more things than my poor mother could ; she even once wrote a letter to the bishop for my father . But he missed my mother sorely ; the whole parish noticed it . Not that he was less active ; I think he was more so , and more patient in helping every one . I did all I could to set Deborah at liberty to be with him ; for I knew I was good for little , and that my best work in the world was to do odd jobs quietly , and set others at liberty . But my father was a changed man . ”
30857	30865	30612	30613	the countrywomen	1092	“ Did Mr Peter ever come home ? ”
30866	30980	30617	30620	old Clare ’s wife	1093	“ Yes , once . He came home a lieutenant ; he did not get to be admiral . And he and my father were such friends ! My father took him into every house in the parish , he was so proud of him . He never walked out without Peter ’s arm to lean upon . Deborah used to smile ( I do n’t think we ever laughed again after my mother ’s death ) , and say she was quite put in a corner . Not but what my father always wanted her when there was letter - writing or reading to be done , or anything to be settled . ”
30981	30985	30987	30987	I	0	“ And then ? ”
30993	31103	30987	30987	I	0	“ Then Peter went to sea again ; and , by - and - by , my father died , blessing us both , and thanking Deborah for all she had been to him ; and , of course , our circumstances were changed ; and , instead of living at the rectory , and keeping three maids and a man , we had to come to this small house , and be content with a servant - of - all - work ; but , as Deborah used to say , we have always lived genteelly , even if circumstances have compelled us to simplicity . Poor Deborah ! ”
31104	31109	31111	31111	I.	1095	“ And Mr Peter ? ”
31112	31211	31111	31111	I.	1095	“ Oh , there was some great war in India — I forget what they call it — and we have never heard of Peter since then . I believe he is dead myself ; and it sometimes fidgets me that we have never put on mourning for him . And then again , when I sit by myself , and all the house is still , I think I hear his step coming up the street , and my heart begins to flutter and beat ; but the sound always goes past — and Peter never comes . “
31266	31289	31292	31292	Martha	98	” So she pattered off . I had lighted the candle , to give the room a cheerful appearance against her return . “
31294	31297	31292	31292	Martha	98	” asked I. “
31322	31323	31316	31316	I	0	” “
31326	31338	31316	31316	I	0	” I asked , for her eyes were round with affright . “
31349	31351	31316	31316	I	0	” — “
31354	31365	31316	31316	I	0	” I put in , as she hesitated a little . “
31369	31704	31316	31316	I	0	” — CHAPTER VII . VISITING ONE morning , as Miss Matty and I sat at our work — it was before twelve o’clock , and Miss Matty had not changed the cap with yellow ribbons that had been Miss Jenkyns ’s best , and which Miss Matty was now wearing out in private , putting on the one made in imitation of Mrs Jamieson ’s at all times when she expected to be seen — Martha came up , and asked if Miss Betty Barker might speak to her mistress . Miss Matty assented , and quickly disappeared to change the yellow ribbons , while Miss Barker came upstairs ; but , as she had forgotten her spectacles , and was rather flurried by the unusual time of the visit , I was not surprised to see her return with one cap on the top of the other . She was quite unconscious of it herself , and looked at us , with bland satisfaction . Nor do I think Miss Barker perceived it ; for , putting aside the little circumstance that she was not so young as she had been , she was very much absorbed in her errand , which she delivered herself of with an oppressive modesty that found vent in endless apologies . Miss Betty Barker was the daughter of the old clerk at Cranford who had officiated in Mr Jenkyns ’s time . She and her sister had had pretty good situations as ladies ’ maids , and had saved money enough to set up a milliner ’s shop , which had been patronised by the ladies in the neighbourhood . Lady Arley , for instance , would occasionally give Miss Barkers the pattern of an old cap of hers , which they immediately copied and circulated among the _ élite _ of Cranford . I say the _ élite _ , for Miss Barkers had caught the trick of the place , and piqued themselves upon their “
31708	31910	31316	31316	I	0	” They would not sell their caps and ribbons to anyone without a pedigree . Many a farmer ’s wife or daughter turned away huffed from Miss Barkers ’ select millinery , and went rather to the universal shop , where the profits of brown soap and moist sugar enabled the proprietor to go straight to ( Paris , he said , until he found his customers too patriotic and John Bullish to wear what the Mounseers wore ) London , where , as he often told his customers , Queen Adelaide had appeared , only the very week before , in a cap exactly like the one he showed them , trimmed with yellow and blue ribbons , and had been complimented by King William on the becoming nature of her head - dress . Miss Barkers , who confined themselves to truth , and did not approve of miscellaneous customers , throve notwithstanding . They were self - denying , good people . Many a time have I seen the eldest of them ( she that had been maid to Mrs Jamieson ) carrying out some delicate mess to a poor person . They only aped their betters in having “
31914	32125	32367	32367	you	0	” with the class immediately below theirs . And when Miss Barker died , their profits and income were found to be such that Miss Betty was justified in shutting up shop and retiring from business . She also ( as I think I have before said ) set up her cow ; a mark of respectability in Cranford almost as decided as setting up a gig is among some people . She dressed finer than any lady in Cranford ; and we did not wonder at it ; for it was understood that she was wearing out all the bonnets and caps and outrageous ribbons which had once formed her stock - in - trade . It was five or six years since she had given up shop , so in any other place than Cranford her dress might have been considered _ passée _ . And now Miss Betty Barker had called to invite Miss Matty to tea at her house on the following Tuesday . She gave me also an impromptu invitation , as I happened to be a visitor — though I could see she had a little fear lest , since my father had gone to live in Drumble , he might have engaged in that “
32130	32139	32367	32367	you	0	” and so dragged his family down out of “
32143	32159	32160	32160	Her	1098	” She prefaced this invitation with so many apologies that she quite excited my curiosity . “
32162	32225	32160	32160	Her	1098	” was to be excused . What had she been doing ? She seemed so overpowered by it I could only think that she had been writing to Queen Adelaide to ask for a receipt for washing lace ; but the act which she so characterised was only an invitation she had carried to her sister ’s former mistress , Mrs Jamieson . “
32238	32359	32232	32233	Miss Matty	98	” Ah ! thought I , she has found out that double cap , and is going to rectify Miss Matty ’s head - dress . No ! it was simply to extend her invitation to Miss Matty and to me . Miss Matty bowed acceptance ; and I wondered that , in the graceful action , she did not feel the unusual weight and extraordinary height of her head - dress . But I do not think she did , for she recovered her balance , and went on talking to Miss Betty in a kind , condescending manner , very different from the fidgety way she would have had if she had suspected how singular her appearance was . “
32370	32375	32367	32367	you	0	” asked Miss Matty . “
32419	32420	32404	32404	I	0	” “
32425	32450	32422	32423	Miss Pole	89	” questioned Miss Matty , who was thinking of her pool at Preference , in which Carlo would not be available as a partner . “
32499	32500	32497	32497	yours	89	” “
32508	32509	32502	32503	Mrs Forrester	77	” “
32560	32580	32553	32554	the Bigges	167	” Miss Matty cared much more for the little circumstance of her being a very good card - player . “
32588	32590	32581	32584	Mrs Fitz - Adam	168	” — “
32648	32695	32697	32697	I	0	” Miss Betty Barker bowed low to Miss Matty , and pursed up her mouth . She looked at me with sidelong dignity , as much as to say , although a retired milliner , she was no democrat , and understood the difference of ranks . “
32743	32795	32796	32797	Miss Betty	81	” And with a swimming curtsey Miss Betty Barker took her leave . My prophetic soul foretold a visit that afternoon from Miss Pole , who usually came to call on Miss Matilda after any event — or indeed in sight of any event — to talk it over with her . “
32810	32823	32796	32797	Miss Betty	81	” said Miss Pole , as she and Miss Matty compared notes . “
32837	33057	32827	32827	she	81	” Now Mrs Fitz - Adam was the widowed sister of the Cranford surgeon , whom I have named before . Their parents were respectable farmers , content with their station . The name of these good people was Hoggins . Mr Hoggins was the Cranford doctor now ; we disliked the name and considered it coarse ; but , as Miss Jenkyns said , if he changed it to Piggins it would not be much better . We had hoped to discover a relationship between him and that Marchioness of Exeter whose name was Molly Hoggins ; but the man , careless of his own interests , utterly ignored and denied any such relationship , although , as dear Miss Jenkyns had said , he had a sister called Mary , and the same Christian names were very apt to run in families . Soon after Miss Mary Hoggins married Mr Fitz - Adam , she disappeared from the neighbourhood for many years . She did not move in a sphere in Cranford society sufficiently high to make any of us care to know what Mr Fitz - Adam was . He died and was gathered to his fathers without our ever having thought about him at all . And then Mrs Fitz - Adam reappeared in Cranford ( “
33064	33104	32827	32827	she	81	” Miss Pole said ) , a well - to - do widow , dressed in rustling black silk , so soon after her husband ’s death that poor Miss Jenkyns was justified in the remark she made , that “
33116	33346	32827	32827	she	81	” I remember the convocation of ladies who assembled to decide whether or not Mrs Fitz - Adam should be called upon by the old blue - blooded inhabitants of Cranford . She had taken a large rambling house , which had been usually considered to confer a patent of gentility upon its tenant , because , once upon a time , seventy or eighty years before , the spinster daughter of an earl had resided in it . I am not sure if the inhabiting this house was not also believed to convey some unusual power of intellect ; for the earl ’s daughter , Lady Jane , had a sister , Lady Anne , who had married a general officer in the time of the American war , and this general officer had written one or two comedies , which were still acted on the London boards , and which , when we saw them advertised , made us all draw up , and feel that Drury Lane was paying a very pretty compliment to Cranford . Still , it was not at all a settled thing that Mrs Fitz - Adam was to be visited , when dear Miss Jenkyns died ; and , with her , something of the clear knowledge of the strict code of gentility went out too . As Miss Pole observed , “
33392	33401	33402	33402	She	1119	” Mrs Forrester continued on the same side . “
33615	33958	33961	33961	Peggy	177	” Mrs Fitz - Adam did not stand a chance of meeting with a Mr Fitz - anything in Cranford , so that could not have been her motive for settling there . Miss Matty thought it might have been the hope of being admitted into the society of the place , which would certainly be a very agreeable rise for _ ci - devant _ Miss Hoggins ; and if this had been her hope it would be cruel to disappoint her . So everybody called upon Mrs Fitz - Adam — everybody but Mrs Jamieson , who used to show how honourable she was by never seeing Mrs Fitz - Adam when they met at the Cranford parties . There would be only eight or ten ladies in the room , and Mrs Fitz - Adam was the largest of all , and she invariably used to stand up when Mrs Jamieson came in , and curtsey very low to her whenever she turned in her direction — so low , in fact , that I think Mrs Jamieson must have looked at the wall above her , for she never moved a muscle of her face , no more than if she had not seen her . Still Mrs Fitz - Adam persevered . The spring evenings were getting bright and long when three or four ladies in calashes met at Miss Barker ’s door . Do you know what a calash is ? It is a covering worn over caps , not unlike the heads fastened on old - fashioned gigs ; but sometimes it is not quite so large . This kind of head - gear always made an awful impression on the children in Cranford ; and now two or three left off their play in the quiet sunny little street , and gathered in wondering silence round Miss Pole , Miss Matty , and myself . We were silent too , so that we could hear loud , suppressed whispers inside Miss Barker ’s house : “
33989	34104	33982	33982	I	0	” And , true enough it was not a minute before we heard a noise , between a sneeze and a crow ; on which the door flew open . Behind it stood a round - eyed maiden , all aghast at the honourable company of calashes , who marched in without a word . She recovered presence of mind enough to usher us into a small room , which had been the shop , but was now converted into a temporary dressing - room . There we unpinned and shook ourselves , and arranged our features before the glass into a sweet and gracious company - face ; and then , bowing backwards with “
34110	34409	34106	34106	you	177	” we allowed Mrs Forrester to take precedence up the narrow staircase that led to Miss Barker ’s drawing - room . There she sat , as stately and composed as though we had never heard that odd - sounding cough , from which her throat must have been even then sore and rough . Kind , gentle , shabbily - dressed Mrs Forrester was immediately conducted to the second place of honour — a seat arranged something like Prince Albert ’s near the Queen’s — good , but not so good . The place of pre - eminence was , of course , reserved for the Honourable Mrs Jamieson , who presently came panting up the stairs — Carlo rushing round her on her progress , as if he meant to trip her up . And now Miss Betty Barker was a proud and happy woman ! She stirred the fire , and shut the door , and sat as near to it as she could , quite on the edge of her chair . When Peggy came in , tottering under the weight of the tea - tray , I noticed that Miss Barker was sadly afraid lest Peggy should not keep her distance sufficiently . She and her mistress were on very familiar terms in their every - day intercourse , and Peggy wanted now to make several little confidences to her , which Miss Barker was on thorns to hear , but which she thought it her duty , as a lady , to repress . So she turned away from all Peggy ’s asides and signs ; but she made one or two very malapropos answers to what was said ; and at last , seized with a bright idea , she exclaimed , “
34439	34462	34433	34433	its	166	” In a few minutes she returned , bland and benignant as before ; but I thought she had forgotten to give the “
34466	34723	34433	34433	its	166	” anything to eat , judging by the avidity with which he swallowed down chance pieces of cake . The tea - tray was abundantly loaded — I was pleased to see it , I was so hungry ; but I was afraid the ladies present might think it vulgarly heaped up . I know they would have done at their own houses ; but somehow the heaps disappeared here . I saw Mrs Jamieson eating seed - cake , slowly and considerately , as she did everything ; and I was rather surprised , for I knew she had told us , on the occasion of her last party , that she never had it in her house , it reminded her so much of scented soap . She always gave us Savoy biscuits . However , Mrs Jamieson was kindly indulgent to Miss Barker ’s want of knowledge of the customs of high life ; and , to spare her feelings , ate three large pieces of seed - cake , with a placid , ruminating expression of countenance , not unlike a cow ’s . After tea there was some little demur and difficulty . We were six in number ; four could play at Preference , and for the other two there was Cribbage . But all , except myself ( I was rather afraid of the Cranford ladies at cards , for it was the most earnest and serious business they ever engaged in ) , were anxious to be of the “
34726	34889	34433	34433	its	166	” Even Miss Barker , while declaring she did not know Spadille from Manille , was evidently hankering to take a hand . The dilemma was soon put an end to by a singular kind of noise . If a baron ’s daughter - in - law could ever be supposed to snore , I should have said Mrs Jamieson did so then ; for , overcome by the heat of the room , and inclined to doze by nature , the temptation of that very comfortable arm - chair had been too much for her , and Mrs Jamieson was nodding . Once or twice she opened her eyes with an effort , and calmly but unconsciously smiled upon us ; but by - and - by , even her benevolence was not equal to this exertion , and she was sound asleep . [ Picture : The temptation of the comfortable arm - chair had been too much for her ] “
34897	34922	35088	35088	you	2218	” whispered Miss Barker at the card - table to her three opponents , whom , notwithstanding her ignorance of the game , she was “
34924	34926	35088	35088	you	2218	” most unmercifully—“very
34955	35082	34945	34945	she	78	” Miss Barker provided me with some literature in the shape of three or four handsomely - bound fashion - books ten or twelve years old , observing , as she put a little table and a candle for my especial benefit , that she knew young people liked to look at pictures . Carlo lay and snorted , and started at his mistress ’s feet . He , too , was quite at home . The card - table was an animated scene to watch ; four ladies ’ heads , with niddle - noddling caps , all nearly meeting over the middle of the table in their eagerness to whisper quick enough and loud enough : and every now and then came Miss Barker ’s “
35098	35170	35093	35094	Mrs Jamieson	78	” It was very difficult to steer clear between Mrs Forrester ’s deafness and Mrs Jamieson ’s sleepiness . But Miss Barker managed her arduous task well . She repeated the whisper to Mrs Forrester , distorting her face considerably , in order to show , by the motions of her lips , what was said ; and then she smiled kindly all round at us , and murmured to herself , “
35189	35275	35178	35180	my poor sister	1140	” Presently the door was thrown wide open ; Carlo started to his feet , with a loud snapping bark , and Mrs Jamieson awoke : or , perhaps , she had not been asleep — as she said almost directly , the room had been so light she had been glad to keep her eyes shut , but had been listening with great interest to all our amusing and agreeable conversation . Peggy came in once more , red with importance . Another tray ! “
35280	35284	35178	35180	my poor sister	1140	” thought I , “
35292	35312	35178	35180	my poor sister	1140	” For Miss Barker had ordered ( nay , I doubt not , prepared , although she did say , “
35323	35352	35319	35319	you	177	” and looked pleasantly surprised at the unexpected pleasure ) all sorts of good things for supper — scalloped oysters , potted lobsters , jelly , a dish called “
35355	35509	35319	35319	you	177	” ( which was in great favour with the Cranford ladies , although too expensive to be given , except on solemn and state occasions — macaroons sopped in brandy , I should have called it , if I had not known its more refined and classical name ) . In short , we were evidently to be feasted with all that was sweetest and best ; and we thought it better to submit graciously , even at the cost of our gentility — which never ate suppers in general , but which , like most non - supper - eaters , was particularly hungry on all special occasions . Miss Barker , in her former sphere , had , I daresay , been made acquainted with the beverage they call cherry - brandy . We none of us had ever seen such a thing , and rather shrank back when she proffered it us—“just
35537	35614	35663	35663	You	2218	” We all shook our heads like female mandarins ; but , at last , Mrs Jamieson suffered herself to be persuaded , and we followed her lead . It was not exactly unpalatable , though so hot and so strong that we thought ourselves bound to give evidence that we were not accustomed to such things by coughing terribly — almost as strangely as Miss Barker had done , before we were admitted by Peggy . “
35620	35633	35634	35634	I	0	” said Miss Pole , as she put down her empty glass ; “
35643	35644	35634	35634	I	0	” “
35657	35662	35634	35634	I	0	” said Miss Barker . “
35688	35728	35729	35729	My	0	” I question whether damson tart would have opened Mrs Jamieson ’s heart as the cherry - brandy did ; but she told us of a coming event , respecting which she had been quite silent till that moment . “
35746	35752	35736	35737	Lady Glenmire	182	” There was a chorus of “
35755	35859	35729	35729	My	0	” and then a pause . Each one rapidly reviewed her wardrobe , as to its fitness to appear in the presence of a baron ’s widow ; for , of course , a series of small festivals were always held in Cranford on the arrival of a visitor at any of our friends ’ houses . We felt very pleasantly excited on the present occasion . Not long after this the maids and the lanterns were announced . Mrs Jamieson had the sedan - chair , which had squeezed itself into Miss Barker ’s narrow lobby with some difficulty , and most literally “
35864	36017	35729	35729	My	0	” It required some skilful manœuvring on the part of the old chairmen ( shoemakers by day , but when summoned to carry the sedan dressed up in a strange old livery — long great - coats , with small capes , coeval with the sedan , and similar to the dress of the class in Hogarth ’s pictures ) to edge , and back , and try at it again , and finally to succeed in carrying their burden out of Miss Barker ’s front door . Then we heard their quick pit - a - pat along the quiet little street as we put on our calashes and pinned up our gowns ; Miss Barker hovering about us with offers of help , which , if she had not remembered her former occupation , and wished us to forget it , would have been much more pressing . CHAPTER VIII . “
36020	36068	35729	35729	My	0	” EARLY the next morning — directly after twelve — Miss Pole made her appearance at Miss Matty ’s . Some very trifling piece of business was alleged as a reason for the call ; but there was evidently something behind . At last out it came . “
36164	36193	36150	36150	you	1146	” Poor Miss Matty ! she took off her spectacles and she put them on again — but how Lady Arley was addressed , she could not remember . “
36200	36204	36205	36205	Dear	2179	” she said . “
36299	36331	36287	36287	you	1155	” It was very certain Miss Pole would obtain no wise decision from Miss Matty , who got more bewildered every moment , and more perplexed as to etiquettes of address . “
36338	36343	36334	36334	I	0	” said Miss Pole , “
36385	36386	36369	36370	Lady Glenmire	182	” “
36441	36457	36437	36438	Sir Peter	121	” said Miss Matty to herself , trying to recall the old forms of words . “
36463	36466	36469	36469	she	182	” asked I. “
36552	36675	36549	36550	Lady Glenmire	182	” It was really a relief to Miss Matty when Mrs Jamieson came on a very unpolite errand . I notice that apathetic people have more quiet impertinence than others ; and Mrs Jamieson came now to insinuate pretty plainly that she did not particularly wish that the Cranford ladies should call upon her sister - in - law . I can hardly say how she made this clear ; for I grew very indignant and warm , while with slow deliberation she was explaining her wishes to Miss Matty , who , a true lady herself , could hardly understand the feeling which made Mrs Jamieson wish to appear to her noble sister - in - law as if she only visited “
36677	36833	36840	36840	You	1165	” families . Miss Matty remained puzzled and perplexed long after I had found out the object of Mrs Jamieson ’s visit . When she did understand the drift of the honourable lady ’s call , it was pretty to see with what quiet dignity she received the intimation thus uncourteously given . She was not in the least hurt — she was of too gentle a spirit for that ; nor was she exactly conscious of disapproving of Mrs Jamieson ’s conduct ; but there was something of this feeling in her mind , I am sure , which made her pass from the subject to others in a less flurried and more composed manner than usual . Mrs Jamieson was , indeed , the more flurried of the two , and I could see she was glad to take her leave . A little while afterwards Miss Pole returned , red and indignant . “
37027	37060	37020	37021	Viscount Arley	190	” Miss Matty tried to soothe Miss Pole , but in vain . That lady , usually so kind and good - humoured , was now in a full flow of anger . “
37076	37095	37062	37062	I	0	” said she at last , letting out the secret which gave sting to Mrs Jamieson ’s intimation . “
37126	37230	37115	37115	she	78	” In coming out of church , the first Sunday on which Lady Glenmire appeared in Cranford , we sedulously talked together , and turned our backs on Mrs Jamieson and her guest . If we might not call on her , we would not even look at her , though we were dying with curiosity to know what she was like . We had the comfort of questioning Martha in the afternoon . Martha did not belong to a sphere of society whose observation could be an implied compliment to Lady Glenmire , and Martha had made good use of her eyes . “
37267	37282	37257	37258	Mrs Smith	191	” ( Mrs Smith was the butcher ’s wife ) . Miss Pole said , “
37296	37306	37293	37294	Mrs Smith	191	” but was silent as Martha resumed her speech . “
37430	37431	37411	37411	she	1186	” “
37436	37441	37434	37434	Martha	98	” said Miss Matty , “
37447	37448	37453	37453	ma’am	2067	” “
37486	37488	37471	37471	He	133	” — “
37491	37496	37497	37497	Lady	1196	” said Miss Pole . “
37503	37850	37500	37501	Mrs Deacon	192	” Another Sunday passed away , and we still averted our eyes from Mrs Jamieson and her guest , and made remarks to ourselves that we thought were very severe — almost too much so . Miss Matty was evidently uneasy at our sarcastic manner of speaking . Perhaps by this time Lady Glenmire had found out that Mrs Jamieson ’s was not the gayest , liveliest house in the world ; perhaps Mrs Jamieson had found out that most of the county families were in London , and that those who remained in the country were not so alive as they might have been to the circumstance of Lady Glenmire being in their neighbourhood . Great events spring out of small causes ; so I will not pretend to say what induced Mrs Jamieson to alter her determination of excluding the Cranford ladies , and send notes of invitation all round for a small party on the following Tuesday . Mr Mulliner himself brought them round . He _ would _ always ignore the fact of there being a back door to any house , and gave a louder rat - tat than his mistress , Mrs Jamieson . He had three little notes , which he carried in a large basket , in order to impress his mistress with an idea of their great weight , though they might easily have gone into his waistcoat pocket . Miss Matty and I quietly decided that we would have a previous engagement at home : it was the evening on which Miss Matty usually made candle - lighters of all the notes and letters of the week ; for on Mondays her accounts were always made straight — not a penny owing from the week before ; so , by a natural arrangement , making candle - lighters fell upon a Tuesday evening , and gave us a legitimate excuse for declining Mrs Jamieson ’s invitation . But before our answer was written , in came Miss Pole , with an open note in her hand . “
37853	37857	37500	37501	Mrs Deacon	192	” she said . “
37896	37897	37882	37882	she	182	” “
37900	37905	37882	37882	she	182	” said Miss Matty , “
38010	38024	38027	38027	you	1198	” I saw Miss Pole ’s countenance change while Miss Matty was speaking . “
38033	38037	38027	38027	you	1198	” asked she . “
38042	38049	38027	38027	you	1198	” said , Miss Matty quietly . “
38058	38059	38050	38050	You	1198	” “
38065	38070	38060	38060	I	0	” replied Miss Pole . “
38078	38096	38075	38075	I	0	” said she , rather briskly ; and on seeing Miss Matty look surprised , she added , “
38175	38176	38162	38162	she	78	” “
38241	38242	38232	38232	I	0	” “
38287	38288	38289	38289	I	0	” “
38309	38375	38299	38300	Mrs Jamieson	78	” said Miss Matty innocently . But Miss Pole , in addition to her delicacies of feeling , possessed a very smart cap , which she was anxious to show to an admiring world ; and so she seemed to forget all her angry words uttered not a fortnight before , and to be ready to act on what she called the great Christian principle of “
38379	38427	38299	38300	Mrs Jamieson	78	” ; and she lectured dear Miss Matty so long on this head that she absolutely ended by assuring her it was her duty , as a deceased rector ’s daughter , to buy a new cap and go to the party at Mrs Jamieson ’s . So “
38435	38438	38299	38300	Mrs Jamieson	78	” instead of “
38447	39092	38299	38300	Mrs Jamieson	78	” [ Picture : Mr Mulliner ] The expenditure on dress in Cranford was principally in that one article referred to . If the heads were buried in smart new caps , the ladies were like ostriches , and cared not what became of their bodies . Old gowns , white and venerable collars , any number of brooches , up and down and everywhere ( some with dogs ’ eyes painted in them ; some that were like small picture - frames with mausoleums and weeping - willows neatly executed in hair inside ; some , again , with miniatures of ladies and gentlemen sweetly smiling out of a nest of stiff muslin ) , old brooches for a permanent ornament , and new caps to suit the fashion of the day — the ladies of Cranford always dressed with chaste elegance and propriety , as Miss Barker once prettily expressed it . And with three new caps , and a greater array of brooches than had ever been seen together at one time since Cranford was a town , did Mrs Forrester , and Miss Matty , and Miss Pole appear on that memorable Tuesday evening . I counted seven brooches myself on Miss Pole ’s dress . Two were fixed negligently in her cap ( one was a butterfly made of Scotch pebbles , which a vivid imagination might believe to be the real insect ) ; one fastened her net neckerchief ; one her collar ; one ornamented the front of her gown , midway between her throat and waist ; and another adorned the point of her stomacher . Where the seventh was I have forgotten , but it was somewhere about her , I am sure . But I am getting on too fast , in describing the dresses of the company . I should first relate the gathering on the way to Mrs Jamieson ’s . That lady lived in a large house just outside the town . A road which had known what it was to be a street ran right before the house , which opened out upon it without any intervening garden or court . Whatever the sun was about , he never shone on the front of that house . To be sure , the living - rooms were at the back , looking on to a pleasant garden ; the front windows only belonged to kitchens and housekeepers ’ rooms , and pantries , and in one of them Mr Mulliner was reported to sit . Indeed , looking askance , we often saw the back of a head covered with hair powder , which also extended itself over his coat - collar down to his very waist ; and this imposing back was always engaged in reading the _ St James ’s Chronicle _ , opened wide , which , in some degree , accounted for the length of time the said newspaper was in reaching us — equal subscribers with Mrs Jamieson , though , in right of her honourableness , she always had the reading of it first . This very Tuesday , the delay in forwarding the last number had been particularly aggravating ; just when both Miss Pole and Miss Matty , the former more especially , had been wanting to see it , in order to coach up the Court news ready for the evening ’s interview with aristocracy . Miss Pole told us she had absolutely taken time by the forelock , and been dressed by five o’clock , in order to be ready if the _ St James ’s Chronicle _ should come in at the last moment — the very _ St James ’s Chronicle _ which the powdered head was tranquilly and composedly reading as we passed the accustomed window this evening . “
39099	39110	39096	39097	the man	424	” said Miss Pole , in a low indignant whisper . “
39130	39762	39121	39121	her	2616	” We looked at her in admiration of the courage of her thought ; for Mr Mulliner was an object of great awe to all of us . He seemed never to have forgotten his condescension in coming to live at Cranford . Miss Jenkyns , at times , had stood forth as the undaunted champion of her sex , and spoken to him on terms of equality ; but even Miss Jenkyns could get no higher . In his pleasantest and most gracious moods he looked like a sulky cockatoo . He did not speak except in gruff monosyllables . He would wait in the hall when we begged him not to wait , and then look deeply offended because we had kept him there , while , with trembling , hasty hands we prepared ourselves for appearing in company . Miss Pole ventured on a small joke as we went upstairs , intended , though addressed to us , to afford Mr Mulliner some slight amusement . We all smiled , in order to seem as if we felt at our ease , and timidly looked for Mr Mulliner ’s sympathy . Not a muscle of that wooden face had relaxed ; and we were grave in an instant . Mrs Jamieson ’s drawing - room was cheerful ; the evening sun came streaming into it , and the large square window was clustered round with flowers . The furniture was white and gold ; not the later style , Louis Quatorze , I think they call it , all shells and twirls ; no , Mrs Jamieson ’s chairs and tables had not a curve or bend about them . The chair and table legs diminished as they neared the ground , and were straight and square in all their corners . The chairs were all a - row against the walls , with the exception of four or five which stood in a circle round the fire . They were railed with white bars across the back and knobbed with gold ; neither the railings nor the knobs invited to ease . There was a japanned table devoted to literature , on which lay a Bible , a Peerage , and a Prayer - Book . There was another square Pembroke table dedicated to the Fine Arts , on which were a kaleidoscope , conversation - cards , puzzle - cards ( tied together to an interminable length with faded pink satin ribbon ) , and a box painted in fond imitation of the drawings which decorate tea - chests . Carlo lay on the worsted - worked rug , and ungraciously barked at us as we entered . Mrs Jamieson stood up , giving us each a torpid smile of welcome , and looking helplessly beyond us at Mr Mulliner , as if she hoped he would place us in chairs , for , if he did not , she never could . I suppose he thought we could find our way to the circle round the fire , which reminded me of Stonehenge , I do n’t know why . Lady Glenmire came to the rescue of our hostess , and , somehow or other , we found ourselves for the first time placed agreeably , and not formally , in Mrs Jamieson ’s house . Lady Glenmire , now we had time to look at her , proved to be a bright little woman of middle age , who had been very pretty in the days of her youth , and who was even yet very pleasant - looking . I saw Miss Pole appraising her dress in the first five minutes , and I take her word when she said the next day — “
39781	39839	39840	39841	A Lord	822	” It was pleasant to suspect that a peeress could be poor , and partly reconciled us to the fact that her husband had never sat in the House of Lords ; which , when we first heard of it , seemed a kind of swindling us out of our prospects on false pretences ; a sort of “
39845	39988	39843	39844	No Lord	1210	” business . We were all very silent at first . We were thinking what we could talk about , that should be high enough to interest My Lady . There had been a rise in the price of sugar , which , as preserving - time was near , was a piece of intelligence to all our house - keeping hearts , and would have been the natural topic if Lady Glenmire had not been by . But we were not sure if the peerage ate preserves — much less knew how they were made . At last , Miss Pole , who had always a great deal of courage and _ savoir faire _ , spoke to Lady Glenmire , who on her part had seemed just as much puzzled to know how to break the silence as we were . “
39997	40023	39990	39991	your ladyship	1147	” asked she ; and then gave a little glance round at us , half timid and half triumphant , as much as to say , “
40039	40040	40036	40037	the stranger	721	” “
40049	40081	40041	40041	I	0	” said Lady Glenmire , with a broad Scotch accent , but in a very sweet voice . And then , as if she had been too abrupt , she added : “
40114	40131	40112	40113	a family	1216	” ( fifth daughter of Mr Campbell was in all our minds , I am sure ) “
40152	40223	40144	40144	Ye’ll	1218	” said she , suddenly brightening up with the hope of a common interest . We had none of us been there ; but Miss Pole had an uncle who once had passed a night there , which was very pleasant . Mrs Jamieson , meanwhile , was absorbed in wonder why Mr Mulliner did not bring the tea ; and at length the wonder oozed out of her mouth . “
40238	40244	40236	40236	I	0	” said Lady Glenmire briskly . “
40259	40311	40312	40312	I	0	” We should have liked our tea , for we dined at an earlier hour than Mrs Jamieson . I suspect Mr Mulliner had to finish the _ St James ’s Chronicle _ before he chose to trouble himself about tea . His mistress fidgeted and fidgeted , and kept saying , “
40333	40386	40328	40328	he	193	” And Lady Glenmire at last grew quite impatient , but it was a pretty kind of impatience after all ; and she rang the bell rather sharply , on receiving a half - permission from her sister - in - law to do so . Mr Mulliner appeared in dignified surprise . “
40389	40394	40328	40328	he	193	” said Mrs Jamieson , “
40408	40826	40395	40396	Lady Glenmire	182	” In a few minutes tea was brought . Very delicate was the china , very old the plate , very thin the bread and butter , and very small the lumps of sugar . Sugar was evidently Mrs Jamieson ’s favourite economy . I question if the little filigree sugar - tongs , made something like scissors , could have opened themselves wide enough to take up an honest , vulgar good - sized piece ; and when I tried to seize two little minnikin pieces at once , so as not to be detected in too many returns to the sugar - basin , they absolutely dropped one , with a little sharp clatter , quite in a malicious and unnatural manner . But before this happened we had had a slight disappointment . In the little silver jug was cream , in the larger one was milk . As soon as Mr Mulliner came in , Carlo began to beg , which was a thing our manners forbade us to do , though I am sure we were just as hungry ; and Mrs Jamieson said she was certain we would excuse her if she gave her poor dumb Carlo his tea first . She accordingly mixed a saucerful for him , and put it down for him to lap ; and then she told us how intelligent and sensible the dear little fellow was ; he knew cream quite well , and constantly refused tea with only milk in it : so the milk was left for us ; but we silently thought we were quite as intelligent and sensible as Carlo , and felt as if insult were added to injury when we were called upon to admire the gratitude evinced by his wagging his tail for the cream which should have been ours . After tea we thawed down into common - life subjects . We were thankful to Lady Glenmire for having proposed some more bread and butter , and this mutual want made us better acquainted with her than we should ever have been with talking about the Court , though Miss Pole did say she had hoped to know how the dear Queen was from some one who had seen her . The friendship begun over bread and butter extended on to cards . Lady Glenmire played Preference to admiration , and was a complete authority as to Ombre and Quadrille . Even Miss Pole quite forgot to say “
40830	40832	40395	40396	Lady Glenmire	182	” and “
40836	40839	40840	40840	Basto	200	” and said “
40843	40845	40846	40846	you	1221	” ; “
40853	40974	40850	40850	I	0	” just as quietly as if we had never held the great Cranford Parliament on the subject of the proper mode of addressing a peeress . As a proof of how thoroughly we had forgotten that we were in the presence of one who might have sat down to tea with a coronet , instead of a cap , on her head , Mrs Forrester related a curious little fact to Lady Glenmire — an anecdote known to the circle of her intimate friends , but of which even Mrs Jamieson was not aware . It related to some fine old lace , the sole relic of better days , which Lady Glenmire was admiring on Mrs Forrester ’s collar . “
40977	40982	40850	40850	I	0	” said that lady , “
41063	41081	41082	41083	my maid	1225	” ( the little charity school - girl I have named before , but who sounded well as “
41084	41087	41088	41088	I	0	” ) . “
41695	41814	41681	41682	your ladyship	1147	” [ Picture : We gave her a teaspoonful of current - jelly ] We found out , in the course of the evening , that Lady Glenmire was going to pay Mrs Jamieson a long visit , as she had given up her apartments in Edinburgh , and had no ties to take her back there in a hurry . On the whole , we were rather glad to hear this , for she had made a pleasant impression upon us ; and it was also very comfortable to find , from things which dropped out in the course of conversation , that , in addition to many other genteel qualities , she was far removed from the “
41819	41820	41681	41682	your ladyship	1147	” “
41830	41889	41823	41823	you	1244	” asked Mrs Jamieson , as our respective servants were announced . It was a pretty regular question from Mrs Jamieson , who had her own carriage in the coach - house , and always went out in a sedan - chair to the very shortest distances . The answers were nearly as much a matter of course . “
41904	41905	41823	41823	you	1244	” “
41916	41917	41823	41823	you	1244	” “
41924	41932	41823	41823	you	1244	” This last was from Miss Matty . “
41939	41944	41934	41934	you	1244	” Lady Glenmire asked . “
41948	42070	42071	42072	my lady	1151	” replied Miss Matty , rather confused at the moment to remember which was astronomy and which was astrology — but the answer was true under either circumstance , for she read , and was slightly alarmed at Francis Moore ’s astrological predictions ; and , as to astronomy , in a private and confidential conversation , she had told me she never could believe that the earth was moving constantly , and that she would not believe it if she could , it made her feel so tired and dizzy whenever she thought about it . In our pattens we picked our way home with extra care that night , so refined and delicate were our perceptions after drinking tea with “
42074	42697	42071	42072	my lady	1151	” CHAPTER IX . SIGNOR BRUNONI SOON after the events of which I gave an account in my last paper , I was summoned home by my father ’s illness ; and for a time I forgot , in anxiety about him , to wonder how my dear friends at Cranford were getting on , or how Lady Glenmire could reconcile herself to the dulness of the long visit which she was still paying to her sister - in - law , Mrs Jamieson . When my father grew a little stronger I accompanied him to the seaside , so that altogether I seemed banished from Cranford , and was deprived of the opportunity of hearing any chance intelligence of the dear little town for the greater part of that year . Late in November — when we had returned home again , and my father was once more in good health — I received a letter from Miss Matty ; and a very mysterious letter it was . She began many sentences without ending them , running them one into another , in much the same confused sort of way in which written words run together on blotting - paper . All I could make out was that , if my father was better ( which she hoped he was ) , and would take warning and wear a great - coat from Michaelmas to Lady - day , if turbans were in fashion , could I tell her ? Such a piece of gaiety was going to happen as had not been seen or known of since Wombwell ’s lions came , when one of them ate a little child ’s arm ; and she was , perhaps , too old to care about dress , but a new cap she must have ; and , having heard that turbans were worn , and some of the county families likely to come , she would like to look tidy , if I would bring her a cap from the milliner I employed ; and oh , dear ! how careless of her to forget that she wrote to beg I would come and pay her a visit next Tuesday ; when she hoped to have something to offer me in the way of amusement , which she would not now more particularly describe , only sea - green was her favourite colour . So she ended her letter ; but in a P.S. she added , she thought she might as well tell me what was the peculiar attraction to Cranford just now ; Signor Brunoni was going to exhibit his wonderful magic in the Cranford Assembly Rooms on Wednesday and Friday evening in the following week . I was very glad to accept the invitation from my dear Miss Matty , independently of the conjuror , and most particularly anxious to prevent her from disfiguring her small , gentle , mousey face with a great Saracen ’s head turban ; and accordingly , I bought her a pretty , neat , middle - aged cap , which , however , was rather a disappointment to her when , on my arrival , she followed me into my bedroom , ostensibly to poke the fire , but in reality , I do believe , to see if the sea - green turban was not inside the cap - box with which I had travelled . It was in vain that I twirled the cap round on my hand to exhibit back and side fronts : her heart had been set upon a turban , and all she could do was to say , with resignation in her look and voice — “
42827	42937	42938	42938	I	0	” So saying , the dear old lady gently bemoaned herself out of the room , leaving me to dress for the evening , when , as she informed me , she expected Miss Pole and Mrs Forrester , and she hoped I should not feel myself too much tired to join the party . Of course I should not ; and I made some haste to unpack and arrange my dress ; but , with all my speed , I heard the arrivals and the buzz of conversation in the next room before I was ready . Just as I opened the door , I caught the words , “
42965	43219	42955	42955	she	1253	” But , for all that , I had rather that she blamed Drumble and me than disfigured herself with a turban . Miss Pole was always the person , in the trio of Cranford ladies now assembled , to have had adventures . She was in the habit of spending the morning in rambling from shop to shop , not to purchase anything ( except an occasional reel of cotton or a piece of tape ) , but to see the new articles and report upon them , and to collect all the stray pieces of intelligence in the town . She had a way , too , of demurely popping hither and thither into all sorts of places to gratify her curiosity on any point — a way which , if she had not looked so very genteel and prim , might have been considered impertinent . And now , by the expressive way in which she cleared her throat , and waited for all minor subjects ( such as caps and turbans ) to be cleared off the course , we knew she had something very particular to relate , when the due pause came — and I defy any people possessed of common modesty to keep up a conversation long , where one among them sits up aloft in silence , looking down upon all the things they chance to say as trivial and contemptible compared to what they could disclose , if properly entreated . Miss Pole began — “
43767	43794	43752	43752	my	0	” Miss Pole , then , had seen the conjuror — the real , live conjuror ! and numerous were the questions we all asked her . “
43800	43801	43796	43796	he	321	” “
43809	43810	43803	43803	he	321	” “
43816	43817	43819	43819	he	321	” “
43820	43832	43834	43834	he	321	look”—(unable to shape my question prudently , I put it in another form)—“How
43837	43998	43834	43834	he	321	” In short , Miss Pole was the heroine of the evening , owing to her morning ’s encounter . If she was not the rose ( that is to say the conjuror ) she had been near it . Conjuration , sleight of hand , magic , witchcraft , were the subjects of the evening . Miss Pole was slightly sceptical , and inclined to think there might be a scientific solution found for even the proceedings of the Witch of Endor . Mrs Forrester believed everything , from ghosts to death - watches . Miss Matty ranged between the two — always convinced by the last speaker . I think she was naturally more inclined to Mrs Forrester ’s side , but a desire of proving herself a worthy sister to Miss Jenkyns kept her equally balanced — Miss Jenkyns , who would never allow a servant to call the little rolls of tallow that formed themselves round candles “
44003	44012	43834	43834	he	321	” but insisted on their being spoken of as “
44017	44181	44184	44184	I	0	” A sister of hers to be superstitious ! It would never do . After tea , I was despatched downstairs into the dining - parlour for that volume of the old Encyclopædia which contained the nouns beginning with C , in order that Miss Pole might prime herself with scientific explanations for the tricks of the following evening . It spoilt the pool at Preference which Miss Matty and Mrs Forrester had been looking forward to , for Miss Pole became so much absorbed in her subject , and the plates by which it was illustrated , that we felt it would be cruel to disturb her otherwise than by one or two well - timed yawns , which I threw in now and then , for I was really touched by the meek way in which the two ladies were bearing their disappointment . But Miss Pole only read the more zealously , imparting to us no more information than this — “
44259	44480	44252	44252	me	0	” Mrs Forrester implored Miss Pole to spare her , saying , from a child upwards , she never could understand being read aloud to ; and I dropped the pack of cards , which I had been shuffling very audibly , and by this discreet movement I obliged Miss Pole to perceive that Preference was to have been the order of the evening , and to propose , rather unwillingly , that the pool should commence . The pleasant brightness that stole over the other two ladies ’ faces on this ! Miss Matty had one or two twinges of self - reproach for having interrupted Miss Pole in her studies : and did not remember her cards well , or give her full attention to the game , until she had soothed her conscience by offering to lend the volume of the Encyclopædia to Miss Pole , who accepted it thankfully , and said Betty should take it home when she came with the lantern . The next evening we were all in a little gentle flutter at the idea of the gaiety before us . Miss Matty went up to dress betimes , and hurried me until I was ready , when we found we had an hour - and - a - half to wait before the “
44487	44567	44252	44252	me	0	” And we had only twenty yards to go ! However , as Miss Matty said , it would not do to get too much absorbed in anything , and forget the time ; so she thought we had better sit quietly , without lighting the candles , till five minutes to seven . So Miss Matty dozed , and I knitted . At length we set off ; and at the door under the carriage - way at the “
44570	44616	44252	44252	me	0	” we met Mrs Forrester and Miss Pole : the latter was discussing the subject of the evening with more vehemence than ever , and throwing X ’s and B ’s at our heads like hailstones . She had even copied one or two of the “
44617	45175	44252	44252	me	0	receipts”—as she called them — for the different tricks , on backs of letters , ready to explain and to detect Signor Brunoni ’s arts . We went into the cloak - room adjoining the Assembly Room ; Miss Matty gave a sigh or two to her departed youth , and the remembrance of the last time she had been there , as she adjusted her pretty new cap before the strange , quaint old mirror in the cloak - room . The Assembly Room had been added to the inn , about a hundred years before , by the different county families , who met together there once a month during the winter to dance and play at cards . Many a county beauty had first swung through the minuet that she afterwards danced before Queen Charlotte in this very room . It was said that one of the Gunnings had graced the apartment with her beauty ; it was certain that a rich and beautiful widow , Lady Williams , had here been smitten with the noble figure of a young artist , who was staying with some family in the neighbourhood for professional purposes , and accompanied his patrons to the Cranford Assembly . And a pretty bargain poor Lady Williams had of her handsome husband , if all tales were true . Now , no beauty blushed and dimpled along the sides of the Cranford Assembly Room ; no handsome artist won hearts by his bow , _ chapeau bras _ in hand ; the old room was dingy ; the salmon - coloured paint had faded into a drab ; great pieces of plaster had chipped off from the fine wreaths and festoons on its walls ; but still a mouldy odour of aristocracy lingered about the place , and a dusty recollection of the days that were gone made Miss Matty and Mrs Forrester bridle up as they entered , and walk mincingly up the room , as if there were a number of genteel observers , instead of two little boys with a stick of toffee between them with which to beguile the time . We stopped short at the second front row ; I could hardly understand why , until I heard Miss Pole ask a stray waiter if any of the county families were expected ; and when he shook his head , and believed not , Mrs Forrester and Miss Matty moved forwards , and our party represented a conversational square . The front row was soon augmented and enriched by Lady Glenmire and Mrs Jamieson . We six occupied the two front rows , and our aristocratic seclusion was respected by the groups of shopkeepers who strayed in from time to time and huddled together on the back benches . At least I conjectured so , from the noise they made , and the sonorous bumps they gave in sitting down ; but when , in weariness of the obstinate green curtain that would not draw up , but would stare at me with two odd eyes , seen through holes , as in the old tapestry story , I would fain have looked round at the merry chattering people behind me , Miss Pole clutched my arm , and begged me not to turn , for “
45182	45184	44252	44252	me	0	” What “
45187	45357	44252	44252	me	0	” was , I never could find out , but it must have been something eminently dull and tiresome . However , we all sat eyes right , square front , gazing at the tantalising curtain , and hardly speaking intelligibly , we were so afraid of being caught in the vulgarity of making any noise in a place of public amusement . Mrs Jamieson was the most fortunate , for she fell asleep . At length the eyes disappeared — the curtain quivered — one side went up before the other , which stuck fast ; it was dropped again , and , with a fresh effort , and a vigorous pull from some unseen hand , it flew up , revealing to our sight a magnificent gentleman in the Turkish costume , seated before a little table , gazing at us ( I should have said with the same eyes that I had last seen through the hole in the curtain ) with calm and condescending dignity , “
45365	45376	44252	44252	me	0	” as I heard a sentimental voice ejaculate behind me . “
45383	45417	45380	45381	Signor Brunoni	96	” said Miss Pole decidedly ; and so audibly that I am sure he heard , for he glanced down over his flowing beard at our party with an air of mute reproach . “
45431	45477	45478	45478	You	1287	” So she lulled herself into patience . Meanwhile , Miss Matty had reconnoitred through her eye - glass , wiped it , and looked again . Then she turned round , and said to me , in a kind , mild , sorrowful tone — “
45490	45520	45478	45478	You	1287	” But we had no time for more conversation . The Grand Turk , as Miss Pole chose to call him , arose and announced himself as Signor Brunoni . “
45527	45552	45521	45521	I	0	” exclaimed Miss Pole , in a defiant manner . He looked at her again , with the same dignified upbraiding in his countenance . “
45557	45565	45566	45567	Signor Brunoni	96	” she repeated more positively than ever . “
45590	45720	45583	45588	a close - shaved Christian gentleman	1289	” Miss Pole ’s energetic speeches had the good effect of wakening up Mrs Jamieson , who opened her eyes wide , in sign of the deepest attention — a proceeding which silenced Miss Pole and encouraged the Grand Turk to proceed , which he did in very broken English — so broken that there was no cohesion between the parts of his sentences ; a fact which he himself perceived at last , and so left off speaking and proceeded to action . Now we _ were _ astonished . How he did his tricks I could not imagine ; no , not even when Miss Pole pulled out her pieces of paper and began reading aloud — or at least in a very audible whisper — the separate “
45722	45937	45939	45939	she	1290	” for the most common of his tricks . If ever I saw a man frown and look enraged , I saw the Grand Turk frown at Miss Pole ; but , as she said , what could be expected but unchristian looks from a Mussulman ? If Miss Pole were sceptical , and more engrossed with her receipts and diagrams than with his tricks , Miss Matty and Mrs Forrester were mystified and perplexed to the highest degree . Mrs Jamieson kept taking her spectacles off and wiping them , as if she thought it was something defective in them which made the legerdemain ; and Lady Glenmire , who had seen many curious sights in Edinburgh , was very much struck with the tricks , and would not at all agree with Miss Pole , who declared that anybody could do them with a little practice , and that she would , herself , undertake to do all he did , with two hours given to study the Encyclopædia and make her third finger flexible . At last Miss Matty and Mrs Forrester became perfectly awestricken . They whispered together . I sat just behind them , so I could not help hearing what they were saying . Miss Matty asked Mrs Forrester “
45968	46071	45958	45958	they	1291	” — A little shake of the head filled up the blank . Mrs Forrester replied , that the same thought had crossed her mind ; she too was feeling very uncomfortable , it was so very strange . She was quite certain that it was her pocket - handkerchief which was in that loaf just now ; and it had been in her own hand not five minutes before . She wondered who had furnished the bread ? She was sure it could not be Dakin , because he was the churchwarden . Suddenly Miss Matty half - turned towards me — “
46140	46910	46111	46111	he	2120	” I looked , and I saw the tall , thin , dry , dusty rector , sitting surrounded by National School boys , guarded by troops of his own sex from any approach of the many Cranford spinsters . His kind face was all agape with broad smiles , and the boys around him were in chinks of laughing . I told Miss Matty that the Church was smiling approval , which set her mind at ease . [ Picture : Afraid of matrimonial reports ] I have never named Mr Hayter , the rector , because I , as a well - to - do and happy young woman , never came in contact with him . He was an old bachelor , but as afraid of matrimonial reports getting abroad about him as any girl of eighteen : and he would rush into a shop or dive down an entry , sooner than encounter any of the Cranford ladies in the street ; and , as for the Preference parties , I did not wonder at his not accepting invitations to them . To tell the truth , I always suspected Miss Pole of having given very vigorous chase to Mr Hayter when he first came to Cranford ; and not the less , because now she appeared to share so vividly in his dread lest her name should ever be coupled with his . He found all his interests among the poor and helpless ; he had treated the National School boys this very night to the performance ; and virtue was for once its own reward , for they guarded him right and left , and clung round him as if he had been the queen - bee and they the swarm . He felt so safe in their environment that he could even afford to give our party a bow as we filed out . Miss Pole ignored his presence , and pretended to be absorbed in convincing us that we had been cheated , and had not seen Signor Brunoni after all . CHAPTER X. THE PANIC I THINK a series of circumstances dated from Signor Brunoni ’s visit to Cranford , which seemed at the time connected in our minds with him , though I do n’t know that he had anything really to do with them . All at once all sorts of uncomfortable rumours got afloat in the town . There were one or two robberies — real _ bonâ fide _ robberies ; men had up before the magistrates and committed for trial — and that seemed to make us all afraid of being robbed ; and for a long time , at Miss Matty ’s , I know , we used to make a regular expedition all round the kitchens and cellars every night , Miss Matty leading the way , armed with the poker , I following with the hearth - brush , and Martha carrying the shovel and fire - irons with which to sound the alarm ; and by the accidental hitting together of them she often frightened us so much that we bolted ourselves up , all three together , in the back - kitchen , or store - room , or wherever we happened to be , till , when our affright was over , we recollected ourselves and set out afresh with double valiance . By day we heard strange stories from the shopkeepers and cottagers , of carts that went about in the dead of night , drawn by horses shod with felt , and guarded by men in dark clothes , going round the town , no doubt in search of some unwatched house or some unfastened door . Miss Pole , who affected great bravery herself , was the principal person to collect and arrange these reports so as to make them assume their most fearful aspect . But we discovered that she had begged one of Mr Hoggins ’s worn - out hats to hang up in her lobby , and we ( at least I ) had doubts as to whether she really would enjoy the little adventure of having her house broken into , as she protested she should . Miss Matty made no secret of being an arrant coward , but she went regularly through her housekeeper ’s duty of inspection — only the hour for this became earlier and earlier , till at last we went the rounds at half - past six , and Miss Matty adjourned to bed soon after seven , “
46921	47330	46111	46111	he	2120	” Cranford had so long piqued itself on being an honest and moral town that it had grown to fancy itself too genteel and well - bred to be otherwise , and felt the stain upon its character at this time doubly . But we comforted ourselves with the assurance which we gave to each other that the robberies could never have been committed by any Cranford person ; it must have been a stranger or strangers who brought this disgrace upon the town , and occasioned as many precautions as if we were living among the Red Indians or the French . This last comparison of our nightly state of defence and fortification was made by Mrs Forrester , whose father had served under General Burgoyne in the American war , and whose husband had fought the French in Spain . She indeed inclined to the idea that , in some way , the French were connected with the small thefts , which were ascertained facts , and the burglaries and highway robberies , which were rumours . She had been deeply impressed with the idea of French spies at some time in her life ; and the notion could never be fairly eradicated , but sprang up again from time to time . And now her theory was this:—The Cranford people respected themselves too much , and were too grateful to the aristocracy who were so kind as to live near the town , ever to disgrace their bringing up by being dishonest or immoral ; therefore , we must believe that the robbers were strangers — if strangers , why not foreigners?—if foreigners , who so likely as the French ? Signor Brunoni spoke broken English like a Frenchman ; and , though he wore a turban like a Turk , Mrs Forrester had seen a print of Madame de Staël with a turban on , and another of Mr Denon in just such a dress as that in which the conjuror had made his appearance , showing clearly that the French , as well as the Turks , wore turbans . There could be no doubt Signor Brunoni was a Frenchman — a French spy come to discover the weak and undefended places of England , and doubtless he had his accomplices . For her part , she , Mrs Forrester , had always had her own opinion of Miss Pole ’s adventure at the “
47332	47538	46111	46111	he	2120	Inn”—seeing two men where only one was believed to be . French people had ways and means which , she was thankful to say , the English knew nothing about ; and she had never felt quite easy in her mind about going to see that conjuror — it was rather too much like a forbidden thing , though the rector was there . In short , Mrs Forrester grew more excited than we had ever known her before , and , being an officer ’s daughter and widow , we looked up to her opinion , of course . Really I do not know how much was true or false in the reports which flew about like wildfire just at this time ; but it seemed to me then that there was every reason to believe that at Mardon ( a small town about eight miles from Cranford ) houses and shops were entered by holes made in the walls , the bricks being silently carried away in the dead of the night , and all done so quietly that no sound was heard either in or out of the house . Miss Matty gave it up in despair when she heard of this . “
47544	47548	46111	46111	he	2120	” said she , “
47591	47713	47582	47583	Signor Brunoni	96	” One afternoon , about five o’clock , we were startled by a hasty knock at the door . Miss Matty bade me run and tell Martha on no account to open the door till she ( Miss Matty ) had reconnoitred through the window ; and she armed herself with a footstool to drop down on the head of the visitor , in case he should show a face covered with black crape , as he looked up in answer to her inquiry of who was there . But it was nobody but Miss Pole and Betty . The former came upstairs , carrying a little hand - basket , and she was evidently in a state of great agitation . “
47719	47735	47582	47583	Signor Brunoni	96	” said she to me , as I offered to relieve her of her basket . “
47821	47822	47816	47816	we	1310	” “
47825	47830	47816	47816	we	1310	” said Miss Matty , “
47848	47849	47839	47839	you	1305	” “
47854	47859	47839	47839	you	1305	” answered Miss Pole . “
48006	48693	47986	47986	his	221	” We might have triumphed over Miss Pole , who had professed such bravery until she was frightened ; but we were too glad to perceive that she shared in the weaknesses of humanity to exult over her ; and I gave up my room to her very willingly , and shared Miss Matty ’s bed for the night . But before we retired , the two ladies rummaged up , out of the recesses of their memory , such horrid stories of robbery and murder that I quite quaked in my shoes . Miss Pole was evidently anxious to prove that such terrible events had occurred within her experience that she was justified in her sudden panic ; and Miss Matty did not like to be outdone , and capped every story with one yet more horrible , till it reminded me oddly enough , of an old story I had read somewhere , of a nightingale and a musician , who strove one against the other which could produce the most admirable music , till poor Philomel dropped down dead . One of the stories that haunted me for a long time afterwards was of a girl who was left in charge of a great house in Cumberland on some particular fair - day , when the other servants all went off to the gaieties . The family were away in London , and a pedlar came by , and asked to leave his large and heavy pack in the kitchen , saying he would call for it again at night ; and the girl ( a gamekeeper ’s daughter ) , roaming about in search of amusement , chanced to hit upon a gun hanging up in the hall , and took it down to look at the chasing ; and it went off through the open kitchen door , hit the pack , and a slow dark thread of blood came oozing out . ( How Miss Pole enjoyed this part of the story , dwelling on each word as if she loved it ! ) She rather hurried over the further account of the girl ’s bravery , and I have but a confused idea that , somehow , she baffled the robbers with Italian irons , heated red - hot , and then restored to blackness by being dipped in grease . We parted for the night with an awe - stricken wonder as to what we should hear of in the morning — and , on my part , with a vehement desire for the night to be over and gone : I was so afraid lest the robbers should have seen , from some dark lurking - place , that Miss Pole had carried off her plate , and thus have a double motive for attacking our house . [ Picture : Asked him to take care of us ] But until Lady Glenmire came to call next day we heard of nothing unusual . The kitchen fire - irons were in exactly the same position against the back door as when Martha and I had skilfully piled them up , like spillikins , ready to fall with an awful clatter if only a cat had touched the outside panels . I had wondered what we should all do if thus awakened and alarmed , and had proposed to Miss Matty that we should cover up our faces under the bed - clothes so that there should be no danger of the robbers thinking that we could identify them ; but Miss Matty , who was trembling very much , scouted this idea , and said we owed it to society to apprehend them , and that she should certainly do her best to lay hold of them and lock them up in the garret till morning . When Lady Glenmire came , we almost felt jealous of her . Mrs Jamieson ’s house had really been attacked ; at least there were men ’s footsteps to be seen on the flower borders , underneath the kitchen windows , “
48700	49755	49756	49758	that murderous gang	1325	” and Carlo had barked all through the night as if strangers were abroad . Mrs Jamieson had been awakened by Lady Glenmire , and they had rung the bell which communicated with Mr Mulliner ’s room in the third storey , and when his night - capped head had appeared over the bannisters , in answer to the summons , they had told him of their alarm , and the reasons for it ; whereupon he retreated into his bedroom , and locked the door ( for fear of draughts , as he informed them in the morning ) , and opened the window , and called out valiantly to say , if the supposed robbers would come to him he would fight them ; but , as Lady Glenmire observed , that was but poor comfort , since they would have to pass by Mrs Jamieson ’s room and her own before they could reach him , and must be of a very pugnacious disposition indeed if they neglected the opportunities of robbery presented by the unguarded lower storeys , to go up to a garret , and there force a door in order to get at the champion of the house . Lady Glenmire , after waiting and listening for some time in the drawing - room , had proposed to Mrs Jamieson that they should go to bed ; but that lady said she should not feel comfortable unless she sat up and watched ; and , accordingly , she packed herself warmly up on the sofa , where she was found by the housemaid , when she came into the room at six o’clock , fast asleep ; but Lady Glenmire went to bed , and kept awake all night . When Miss Pole heard of this , she nodded her head in great satisfaction . She had been sure we should hear of something happening in Cranford that night ; and we had heard . It was clear enough they had first proposed to attack her house ; but when they saw that she and Betty were on their guard , and had carried off the plate , they had changed their tactics and gone to Mrs Jamieson ’s , and no one knew what might have happened if Carlo had not barked , like a good dog as he was ! Poor Carlo ! his barking days were nearly over . Whether the gang who infested the neighbourhood were afraid of him , or whether they were revengeful enough , for the way in which he had baffled them on the night in question , to poison him ; or whether , as some among the more uneducated people thought , he died of apoplexy , brought on by too much feeding and too little exercise ; at any rate , it is certain that , two days after this eventful night , Carlo was found dead , with his poor legs stretched out stiff in the attitude of running , as if by such unusual exertion he could escape the sure pursuer , Death . We were all sorry for Carlo , the old familiar friend who had snapped at us for so many years ; and the mysterious mode of his death made us very uncomfortable . Could Signor Brunoni be at the bottom of this ? He had apparently killed a canary with only a word of command ; his will seemed of deadly force ; who knew but what he might yet be lingering in the neighbourhood willing all sorts of awful things ! We whispered these fancies among ourselves in the evenings ; but in the mornings our courage came back with the daylight , and in a week ’s time we had got over the shock of Carlo ’s death ; all but Mrs Jamieson . She , poor thing , felt it as she had felt no event since her husband ’s death ; indeed , Miss Pole said , that as the Honourable Mr Jamieson drank a good deal , and occasioned her much uneasiness , it was possible that Carlo ’s death might be the greater affliction . But there was always a tinge of cynicism in Miss Pole ’s remarks . However , one thing was clear and certain — it was necessary for Mrs Jamieson to have some change of scene ; and Mr Mulliner was very impressive on this point , shaking his head whenever we inquired after his mistress , and speaking of her loss of appetite and bad nights very ominously ; and with justice too , for if she had two characteristics in her natural state of health they were a facility of eating and sleeping . If she could neither eat nor sleep , she must be indeed out of spirits and out of health . Lady Glenmire ( who had evidently taken very kindly to Cranford ) did not like the idea of Mrs Jamieson ’s going to Cheltenham , and more than once insinuated pretty plainly that it was Mr Mulliner ’s doing , who had been much alarmed on the occasion of the house being attacked , and since had said , more than once , that he felt it a very responsible charge to have to defend so many women . Be that as it might , Mrs Jamieson went to Cheltenham , escorted by Mr Mulliner ; and Lady Glenmire remained in possession of the house , her ostensible office being to take care that the maid - servants did not pick up followers . She made a very pleasant - looking dragon ; and , as soon as it was arranged for her stay in Cranford , she found out that Mrs Jamieson ’s visit to Cheltenham was just the best thing in the world . She had let her house in Edinburgh , and was for the time house - less , so the charge of her sister - in - law ’s comfortable abode was very convenient and acceptable . Miss Pole was very much inclined to instal herself as a heroine , because of the decided steps she had taken in flying from the two men and one woman , whom she entitled “
49760	50029	50030	50031	her men	1327	” She described their appearance in glowing colours , and I noticed that every time she went over the story some fresh trait of villainy was added to their appearance . One was tall — he grew to be gigantic in height before we had done with him ; he of course had black hair — and by - and - by it hung in elf - locks over his forehead and down his back . The other was short and broad — and a hump sprouted out on his shoulder before we heard the last of him ; he had red hair — which deepened into carroty ; and she was almost sure he had a cast in the eye — a decided squint . As for the woman , her eyes glared , and she was masculine - looking — a perfect virago ; most probably a man dressed in woman ’s clothes ; afterwards , we heard of a beard on her chin , and a manly voice and a stride . If Miss Pole was delighted to recount the events of that afternoon to all inquirers , others were not so proud of their adventures in the robbery line . Mr Hoggins , the surgeon , had been attacked at his own door by two ruffians , who were concealed in the shadow of the porch , and so effectually silenced him that he was robbed in the interval between ringing his bell and the servant ’s answering it . Miss Pole was sure it would turn out that this robbery had been committed by “
50033	50104	50030	50031	her men	1327	” and went the very day she heard the report to have her teeth examined , and to question Mr Hoggins . She came to us afterwards ; so we heard what she had heard , straight and direct from the source , while we were yet in the excitement and flutter of the agitation caused by the first intelligence ; for the event had only occurred the night before . “
50107	50151	50030	50031	her men	1327	” said Miss Pole , sitting down with the decision of a person who has made up her mind as to the nature of life and the world ( and such people never tread lightly , or seat themselves without a bump ) , “
50234	50300	50223	50224	a man	2058	” She had talked herself out of breath , and we should have been very glad to fill up the necessary pause as chorus , but we did not exactly know what to say , or which man had suggested this diatribe against the sex ; so we only joined in generally , with a grave shake of the head , and a soft murmur of “
50308	50309	50301	50301	They	491	” “
50315	50319	50301	50301	They	491	” said she . “
50393	50394	50387	50387	he	105	” “
50398	50403	50434	50434	Betty	81	” exclaimed the chorus . “
50409	50425	50426	50426	I	0	” Miss Pole exclaimed , angry that we could be for a moment imposed upon . “
50598	51996	50574	50596	that Irishman dressed up in woman ’s clothes , who came spying about my house , with the story about the starving children	1340	” After we had duly condemned the want of candour which Mr Hoggins had evinced , and abused men in general , taking him for the representative and type , we got round to the subject about which we had been talking when Miss Pole came in ; namely , how far , in the present disturbed state of the country , we could venture to accept an invitation which Miss Matty had just received from Mrs Forrester , to come as usual and keep the anniversary of her wedding - day by drinking tea with her at five o’clock , and playing a quiet pool afterwards . Mrs Forrester had said that she asked us with some diffidence , because the roads were , she feared , very unsafe . But she suggested that perhaps one of us would not object to take the sedan , and that the others , by walking briskly , might keep up with the long trot of the chairmen , and so we might all arrive safely at Over Place , a suburb of the town . ( No ; that is too large an expression : a small cluster of houses separated from Cranford by about two hundred yards of a dark and lonely lane . ) There was no doubt but that a similar note was awaiting Miss Pole at home ; so her call was a very fortunate affair , as it enabled us to consult together . We would all much rather have declined this invitation ; but we felt that it would not be quite kind to Mrs Forrester , who would otherwise be left to a solitary retrospect of her not very happy or fortunate life . Miss Matty and Miss Pole had been visitors on this occasion for many years , and now they gallantly determined to nail their colours to the mast , and to go through Darkness Lane rather than fail in loyalty to their friend . But when the evening came , Miss Matty ( for it was she who was voted into the chair , as she had a cold ) , before being shut down in the sedan , like jack - in - a - box , implored the chairmen , whatever might befall , not to run away and leave her fastened up there , to be murdered ; and even after they had promised , I saw her tighten her features into the stern determination of a martyr , and she gave me a melancholy and ominous shake of the head through the glass . However , we got there safely , only rather out of breath , for it was who could trot hardest through Darkness Lane , and I am afraid poor Miss Matty was sadly jolted . Mrs Forrester had made extra preparations , in acknowledgment of our exertion in coming to see her through such dangers . The usual forms of genteel ignorance as to what her servants might send up were all gone through ; and harmony and Preference seemed likely to be the order of the evening , but for an interesting conversation that began I do n’t know how , but which had relation , of course , to the robbers who infested the neighbourhood of Cranford . Having braved the dangers of Darkness Lane , and thus having a little stock of reputation for courage to fall back upon ; and also , I daresay , desirous of proving ourselves superior to men ( _ videlicet _ Mr Hoggins ) in the article of candour , we began to relate our individual fears , and the private precautions we each of us took . I owned that my pet apprehension was eyes — eyes looking at me , and watching me , glittering out from some dull , flat , wooden surface ; and that if I dared to go up to my looking - glass when I was panic - stricken , I should certainly turn it round , with its back towards me , for fear of seeing eyes behind me looking out of the darkness . I saw Miss Matty nerving herself up for a confession ; and at last out it came . She owned that , ever since she had been a girl , she had dreaded being caught by her last leg , just as she was getting into bed , by some one concealed under it . She said , when she was younger and more active , she used to take a flying leap from a distance , and so bring both her legs up safely into bed at once ; but that this had always annoyed Deborah , who piqued herself upon getting into bed gracefully , and she had given it up in consequence . But now the old terror would often come over her , especially since Miss Pole ’s house had been attacked ( we had got quite to believe in the fact of the attack having taken place ) , and yet it was very unpleasant to think of looking under a bed , and seeing a man concealed , with a great , fierce face staring out at you ; so she had bethought herself of something — perhaps I had noticed that she had told Martha to buy her a penny ball , such as children play with — and now she rolled this ball under the bed every night : if it came out on the other side , well and good ; if not she always took care to have her hand on the bell - rope , and meant to call out John and Harry , just as if she expected men - servants to answer her ring . We all applauded this ingenious contrivance , and Miss Matty sank back into satisfied silence , with a look at Mrs Forrester as if to ask for _ her _ private weakness . Mrs Forrester looked askance at Miss Pole , and tried to change the subject a little by telling us that she had borrowed a boy from one of the neighbouring cottages and promised his parents a hundredweight of coals at Christmas , and his supper every evening , for the loan of him at nights . She had instructed him in his possible duties when he first came ; and , finding him sensible , she had given him the Major ’s sword ( the Major was her late husband ) , and desired him to put it very carefully behind his pillow at night , turning the edge towards the head of the pillow . He was a sharp lad , she was sure ; for , spying out the Major ’s cocked hat , he had said , if he might have that to wear , he was sure he could frighten two Englishmen , or four Frenchmen any day . But she had impressed upon him anew that he was to lose no time in putting on hats or anything else ; but , if he heard any noise , he was to run at it with his drawn sword . On my suggesting that some accident might occur from such slaughterous and indiscriminate directions , and that he might rush on Jenny getting up to wash , and have spitted her before he had discovered that she was not a Frenchman , Mrs Forrester said she did not think that that was likely , for he was a very sound sleeper , and generally had to be well shaken or cold - pigged in a morning before they could rouse him . She sometimes thought such dead sleep must be owing to the hearty suppers the poor lad ate , for he was half - starved at home , and she told Jenny to see that he got a good meal at night . [ Picture : Slaughterous and indiscriminate directions ] Still this was no confession of Mrs Forrester ’s peculiar timidity , and we urged her to tell us what she thought would frighten her more than anything . She paused , and stirred the fire , and snuffed the candles , and then she said , in a sounding whisper — “
51999	52633	50574	50596	that Irishman dressed up in woman ’s clothes , who came spying about my house , with the story about the starving children	1340	” She looked at Miss Pole , as much as to say , she had declared it , and would stand by it . Such a look was a challenge in itself . Miss Pole came down upon her with indigestion , spectral illusions , optical delusions , and a great deal out of Dr Ferrier and Dr Hibbert besides . Miss Matty had rather a leaning to ghosts , as I have mentioned before , and what little she did say was all on Mrs Forrester ’s side , who , emboldened by sympathy , protested that ghosts were a part of her religion ; that surely she , the widow of a major in the army , knew what to be frightened at , and what not ; in short , I never saw Mrs Forrester so warm either before or since , for she was a gentle , meek , enduring old lady in most things . Not all the elder - wine that ever was mulled could this night wash out the remembrance of this difference between Miss Pole and her hostess . Indeed , when the elder - wine was brought in , it gave rise to a new burst of discussion ; for Jenny , the little maiden who staggered under the tray , had to give evidence of having seen a ghost with her own eyes , not so many nights ago , in Darkness Lane , the very lane we were to go through on our way home . In spite of the uncomfortable feeling which this last consideration gave me , I could not help being amused at Jenny ’s position , which was exceedingly like that of a witness being examined and cross - examined by two counsel who are not at all scrupulous about asking leading questions . The conclusion I arrived at was , that Jenny had certainly seen something beyond what a fit of indigestion would have caused . A lady all in white , and without her head , was what she deposed and adhered to , supported by a consciousness of the secret sympathy of her mistress under the withering scorn with which Miss Pole regarded her . And not only she , but many others , had seen this headless lady , who sat by the roadside wringing her hands as in deep grief . Mrs Forrester looked at us from time to time with an air of conscious triumph ; but then she had not to pass through Darkness Lane before she could bury herself beneath her own familiar bed - clothes . We preserved a discreet silence as to the headless lady while we were putting on our things to go home , for there was no knowing how near the ghostly head and ears might be , or what spiritual connection they might be keeping up with the unhappy body in Darkness Lane ; and , therefore , even Miss Pole felt that it was as well not to speak lightly on such subjects , for fear of vexing or insulting that woebegone trunk . At least , so I conjecture ; for , instead of the busy clatter usual in the operation , we tied on our cloaks as sadly as mutes at a funeral . Miss Matty drew the curtains round the windows of the chair to shut out disagreeable sights , and the men ( either because they were in spirits that their labours were so nearly ended , or because they were going down hill ) , set off at such a round and merry pace , that it was all Miss Pole and I could do to keep up with them . She had breath for nothing beyond an imploring “
52639	52702	50574	50596	that Irishman dressed up in woman ’s clothes , who came spying about my house , with the story about the starving children	1340	” uttered as she clutched my arm so tightly that I could not have quitted her , ghost or no ghost . What a relief it was when the men , weary of their burden and their quick trot , stopped just where Headingley Causeway branches off from Darkness Lane ! Miss Pole unloosed me and caught at one of the men — “
52731	52744	52725	52725	she	98	” A smothered voice was heard from the inside of the chair — “
52779	52780	52761	52761	I	0	” “
52789	52798	52782	52782	I	0	” said Miss Pole , with tremulous dignity , “
52807	52936	52937	52937	I	0	” The two men grunted acquiescence and took up the chair , and went along the causeway , which certainly answered Miss Pole ’s kind purpose of saving Miss Matty ’s bones ; for it was covered with soft , thick mud , and even a fall there would have been easy till the getting - up came , when there might have been some difficulty in extrication . CHAPTER XI . SAMUEL BROWN THE next morning I met Lady Glenmire and Miss Pole setting out on a long walk to find some old woman who was famous in the neighbourhood for her skill in knitting woollen stockings . Miss Pole said to me , with a smile half - kindly and half - contemptuous upon her countenance , “
52981	53268	52976	52979	that Jenny of hers	1347	” She was so calm and so much above superstitious fears herself that I was almost ashamed to say how glad I had been of her Headingley Causeway proposition the night before , and turned off the conversation to something else . In the afternoon Miss Pole called on Miss Matty to tell her of the adventure — the real adventure they had met with on their morning ’s walk . They had been perplexed about the exact path which they were to take across the fields in order to find the knitting old woman , and had stopped to inquire at a little wayside public - house , standing on the high road to London , about three miles from Cranford . The good woman had asked them to sit down and rest themselves while she fetched her husband , who could direct them better than she could ; and , while they were sitting in the sanded parlour , a little girl came in . They thought that she belonged to the landlady , and began some trifling conversation with her ; but , on Mrs Roberts ’s return , she told them that the little thing was the only child of a couple who were staying in the house . And then she began a long story , out of which Lady Glenmire and Miss Pole could only gather one or two decided facts , which were that , about six weeks ago , a light spring - cart had broken down just before their door , in which there were two men , one woman , and this child . One of the men was seriously hurt — no bones broken , only “
53271	53685	52976	52979	that Jenny of hers	1347	” the landlady called it ; but he had probably sustained some severe internal injury , for he had languished in their house ever since , attended by his wife , the mother of this little girl . Miss Pole had asked what he was , what he looked like . And Mrs Roberts had made answer that he was not like a gentleman , nor yet like a common person ; if it had not been that he and his wife were such decent , quiet people , she could almost have thought he was a mountebank , or something of that kind , for they had a great box in the cart , full of she did not know what . She had helped to unpack it , and take out their linen and clothes , when the other man — his twin - brother , she believed he was — had gone off with the horse and cart . Miss Pole had begun to have her suspicions at this point , and expressed her idea that it was rather strange that the box and cart and horse and all should have disappeared ; but good Mrs Roberts seemed to have become quite indignant at Miss Pole ’s implied suggestion ; in fact , Miss Pole said she was as angry as if Miss Pole had told her that she herself was a swindler . As the best way of convincing the ladies , she bethought her of begging them to see the wife ; and , as Miss Pole said , there was no doubting the honest , worn , bronzed face of the woman , who at the first tender word from Lady Glenmire , burst into tears , which she was too weak to check until some word from the landlady made her swallow down her sobs , in order that she might testify to the Christian kindness shown by Mr and Mrs Roberts . Miss Pole came round with a swing to as vehement a belief in the sorrowful tale as she had been sceptical before ; and , as a proof of this , her energy in the poor sufferer ’s behalf was nothing daunted when she found out that he , and no other , was our Signor Brunoni , to whom all Cranford had been attributing all manner of evil this six weeks past ! Yes ! his wife said his proper name was Samuel Brown—“Sam
53687	53700	53701	53703	the Signor ”	3125	” she called him — but to the last we preferred calling him “
53703	53765	53701	53703	the Signor ”	3125	” ; it sounded so much better . The end of their conversation with the Signora Brunoni was that it was agreed that he should be placed under medical advice , and for any expense incurred in procuring this Lady Glenmire promised to hold herself responsible , and had accordingly gone to Mr Hoggins to beg him to ride over to the “
53768	53921	53922	53922	Jack	230	” that very afternoon , and examine into the signor ’s real state ; and , as Miss Pole said , if it was desirable to remove him to Cranford to be more immediately under Mr Hoggins ’s eye , she would undertake to see for lodgings and arrange about the rent . Mrs Roberts had been as kind as could be all throughout , but it was evident that their long residence there had been a slight inconvenience . Before Miss Pole left us , Miss Matty and I were as full of the morning ’s adventure as she was . We talked about it all the evening , turning it in every possible light , and we went to bed anxious for the morning , when we should surely hear from someone what Mr Hoggins thought and recommended ; for , as Miss Matty observed , though Mr Hoggins did say “
53926	53927	53922	53922	Jack	230	” “
53934	53938	53922	53922	Jack	230	” and called Preference “
53941	54237	53922	53922	Jack	230	” she believed he was a very worthy man and a very clever surgeon . Indeed , we were rather proud of our doctor at Cranford , as a doctor . We often wished , when we heard of Queen Adelaide or the Duke of Wellington being ill , that they would send for Mr Hoggins ; but , on consideration , we were rather glad they did not , for , if we were ailing , what should we do if Mr Hoggins had been appointed physician - in - ordinary to the Royal Family ? As a surgeon we were proud of him ; but as a man — or rather , I should say , as a gentleman — we could only shake our heads over his name and himself , and wished that he had read Lord Chesterfield ’s Letters in the days when his manners were susceptible of improvement . Nevertheless , we all regarded his dictum in the signor ’s case as infallible , and when he said that with care and attention he might rally , we had no more fear for him . But , although we had no more fear , everybody did as much as if there was great cause for anxiety — as indeed there was until Mr Hoggins took charge of him . Miss Pole looked out clean and comfortable , if homely , lodgings ; Miss Matty sent the sedan - chair for him , and Martha and I aired it well before it left Cranford by holding a warming - pan full of red - hot coals in it , and then shutting it up close , smoke and all , until the time when he should get into it at the “
54241	54750	53922	53922	Jack	230	” Lady Glenmire undertook the medical department under Mr Hoggins ’s directions , and rummaged up all Mrs Jamieson ’s medicine glasses , and spoons , and bed - tables , in a free - and - easy way , that made Miss Matty feel a little anxious as to what that lady and Mr Mulliner might say , if they knew . Mrs Forrester made some of the bread - jelly , for which she was so famous , to have ready as a refreshment in the lodgings when he should arrive . A present of this bread - jelly was the highest mark of favour dear Mrs Forrester could confer . Miss Pole had once asked her for the receipt , but she had met with a very decided rebuff ; that lady told her that she could not part with it to any one during her life , and that after her death it was bequeathed , as her executors would find , to Miss Matty . What Miss Matty , or , as Mrs Forrester called her ( remembering the clause in her will and the dignity of the occasion ) , Miss Matilda Jenkyns — might choose to do with the receipt when it came into her possession — whether to make it public , or to hand it down as an heirloom — she did not know , nor would she dictate . And a mould of this admirable , digestible , unique bread - jelly was sent by Mrs Forrester to our poor sick conjuror . Who says that the aristocracy are proud ? Here was a lady by birth a Tyrrell , and descended from the great Sir Walter that shot King Rufus , and in whose veins ran the blood of him who murdered the little princes in the Tower , going every day to see what dainty dishes she could prepare for Samuel Brown , a mountebank ! But , indeed , it was wonderful to see what kind feelings were called out by this poor man ’s coming amongst us . And also wonderful to see how the great Cranford panic , which had been occasioned by his first coming in his Turkish dress , melted away into thin air on his second coming — pale and feeble , and with his heavy , filmy eyes , that only brightened a very little when they fell upon the countenance of his faithful wife , or their pale and sorrowful little girl . Somehow we all forgot to be afraid . I daresay it was that finding out that he , who had first excited our love of the marvellous by his unprecedented arts , had not sufficient every - day gifts to manage a shying horse , made us feel as if we were ourselves again . Miss Pole came with her little basket at all hours of the evening , as if her lonely house and the unfrequented road to it had never been infested by that “
54753	54874	54875	54875	My	0	” ; Mrs Forrester said she thought that neither Jenny nor she need mind the headless lady who wept and wailed in Darkness Lane , for surely the power was never given to such beings to harm those who went about to try to do what little good was in their power , to which Jenny tremblingly assented ; but the mistress ’s theory had little effect on the maid ’s practice until she had sewn two pieces of red flannel in the shape of a cross on her inner garment . I found Miss Matty covering her penny ball — the ball that she used to roll under her bed — with gay - coloured worsted in rainbow stripes . “
54878	54882	54875	54876	My dear	2063	” said she , “
54981	55092	55094	55094	she	1357	” We were all of us far too full of the signor ’s precarious state to talk either about robbers or ghosts . Indeed , Lady Glenmire said she never had heard of any actual robberies , except that two little boys had stolen some apples from Farmer Benson ’s orchard , and that some eggs had been missed on a market - day off Widow Hayward ’s stall . But that was expecting too much of us ; we could not acknowledge that we had only had this small foundation for all our panic . Miss Pole drew herself up at this remark of Lady Glenmire ’s , and said “
55175	55242	55243	55244	her ladyship	1362	door”—But here Lady Glenmire broke in with a very strong expression of doubt as to whether this last story was not an entire fabrication founded upon the theft of a cat ; she grew so red while she was saying all this that I was not surprised at Miss Pole ’s manner of bridling up , and I am certain , if Lady Glenmire had not been “
55246	55257	55243	55244	her ladyship	1362	” we should have had a more emphatic contradiction than the “
55264	55567	55243	55244	her ladyship	1362	” and similar fragmentary ejaculations , which were all that she ventured upon in my lady ’s presence . But when she was gone Miss Pole began a long congratulation to Miss Matty that so far they had escaped marriage , which she noticed always made people credulous to the last degree ; indeed , she thought it argued great natural credulity in a woman if she could not keep herself from being married ; and in what Lady Glenmire had said about Mr Hoggins ’s robbery we had a specimen of what people came to if they gave way to such a weakness ; evidently Lady Glenmire would swallow anything if she could believe the poor vamped - up story about a neck of mutton and a pussy with which he had tried to impose on Miss Pole , only she had always been on her guard against believing too much of what men said . We were thankful , as Miss Pole desired us to be , that we had never been married ; but I think , of the two , we were even more thankful that the robbers had left Cranford ; at least I judge so from a speech of Miss Matty ’s that evening , as we sat over the fire , in which she evidently looked upon a husband as a great protector against thieves , burglars , and ghosts ; and said that she did not think that she should dare to be always warning young people against matrimony , as Miss Pole did continually ; to be sure , marriage was a risk , as she saw , now she had had some experience ; but she remembered the time when she had looked forward to being married as much as any one . “
55577	55597	55620	55620	gentlemen	619	” said she , hastily checking herself up , as if she were afraid of having admitted too much ; “
55630	55674	55620	55620	gentlemen	619	” It was a joke spoken in rather a sad tone , and I doubt if either of us smiled ; but I could not see Miss Matty ’s face by the flickering fire - light . In a little while she continued — “
55882	55941	55880	55880	I	0	” continued she , taking my hand and holding it in hers . If I had never known of Mr Holbrook , I could have said something in this pause , but as I had , I could not think of anything that would come in naturally , and so we both kept silence for a little time . “
55948	55952	55942	55943	My father	2082	” she began , “
56018	56028	56033	56033	mine	1376	” ( a tear dropped upon my hand at these words)—“I
56291	56331	56333	56333	you	2063	” ( and by a sudden blaze which sprang up from a fall of the unstirred coals , I saw that her eyes were full of tears — gazing intently on some vision of what might have been ) , “
56533	56742	56751	56751	people	359	” [ Picture : Would stretch out their little arms ] If I had been inclined to be daunted from matrimony , it would not have been Miss Pole to do it ; it would have been the lot of poor Signor Brunoni and his wife . And yet again , it was an encouragement to see how , through all their cares and sorrows , they thought of each other and not of themselves ; and how keen were their joys , if they only passed through each other , or through the little Phœbe . The signora told me , one day , a good deal about their lives up to this period . It began by my asking her whether Miss Pole ’s story of the twin - brothers were true ; it sounded so wonderful a likeness , that I should have had my doubts , if Miss Pole had not been unmarried . But the signora , or ( as we found out she preferred to be called ) Mrs Brown , said it was quite true ; that her brother - in - law was by many taken for her husband , which was of great assistance to them in their profession ; “
56745	56749	56751	56751	people	359	” she continued , “
56906	56907	56909	56909	you	0	” “
56914	56921	56909	56909	you	0	” said I , rather astonished . “
57049	57093	57043	57043	I	0	” said she , looking up at me with those strange eyes that I ’ve never noticed but in mothers of dead children — with a kind of wild look in them , as if seeking for what they never more might find . “
57828	57829	57815	57817	a kind Englishman	1459	” “
57838	57839	57831	57831	you	0	” “
58125	58126	58117	58117	himself	96	” “
58131	58149	58127	58129	Poor little Phœbe	235	” said I , my thoughts going back to the baby she carried all those hundred miles . “
58196	58197	58180	58181	Aga Jenkyns	240	” “
58200	58203	58206	58206	Jenkyns	240	” said I. “
58236	58308	58310	58310	Peter	121	” But an idea had flashed through my head ; could the Aga Jenkyns be the lost Peter ? True he was reported by many to be dead . But , equally true , some had said that he had arrived at the dignity of Great Lama of Thibet . Miss Matty thought he was alive . I would make further inquiry . CHAPTER XII . ENGAGED TO BE MARRIED WAS the “
58311	58868	58310	58310	Peter	121	” of Cranford the Aga Jenkyns of Chunderabaddad , or was he not ? As somebody says , that was the question . In my own home , whenever people had nothing else to do , they blamed me for want of discretion . Indiscretion was my bug - bear fault . Everybody has a bug - bear fault , a sort of standing characteristic — a _ pièce de résistance _ for their friends to cut at ; and in general they cut and come again . I was tired of being called indiscreet and incautious ; and I determined for once to prove myself a model of prudence and wisdom . I would not even hint my suspicions respecting the Aga . I would collect evidence and carry it home to lay before my father , as the family friend of the two Miss Jenkynses . In my search after facts , I was often reminded of a description my father had once given of a ladies ’ committee that he had had to preside over . He said he could not help thinking of a passage in Dickens , which spoke of a chorus in which every man took the tune he knew best , and sang it to his own satisfaction . So , at this charitable committee , every lady took the subject uppermost in her mind , and talked about it to her own great contentment , but not much to the advancement of the subject they had met to discuss . But even that committee could have been nothing to the Cranford ladies when I attempted to gain some clear and definite information as to poor Peter ’s height , appearance , and when and where he was seen and heard of last . For instance , I remember asking Miss Pole ( and I thought the question was very opportune , for I put it when I met her at a call at Mrs Forrester ’s , and both the ladies had known Peter , and I imagined that they might refresh each other ’s memories)—I asked Miss Pole what was the very last thing they had ever heard about him ; and then she named the absurd report to which I have alluded , about his having been elected Great Lama of Thibet ; and this was a signal for each lady to go off on her separate idea . Mrs Forrester ’s start was made on the veiled prophet in Lalla Rookh — whether I thought he was meant for the Great Lama , though Peter was not so ugly , indeed rather handsome , if he had not been freckled . I was thankful to see her double upon Peter ; but , in a moment , the delusive lady was off upon Rowland ’s Kalydor , and the merits of cosmetics and hair oils in general , and holding forth so fluently that I turned to listen to Miss Pole , who ( through the llamas , the beasts of burden ) had got to Peruvian bonds , and the share market , and her poor opinion of joint - stock banks in general , and of that one in particular in which Miss Matty ’s money was invested . In vain I put in “
58889	59000	58885	58887	the Great Lama	1487	” They only joined issue to dispute whether llamas were carnivorous animals or not ; in which dispute they were not quite on fair grounds , as Mrs Forrester ( after they had grown warm and cool again ) acknowledged that she always confused carnivorous and graminivorous together , just as she did horizontal and perpendicular ; but then she apologised for it very prettily , by saying that in her day the only use people made of four - syllabled words was to teach how they should be spelt . The only fact I gained from this conversation was that certainly Peter had last been heard of in India , “

59158	59601	58885	58887	the Great Lama	1487	” which everybody had thought very grand , and rather appropriate , because India was between China and Peru , if you took care to turn the globe to the left instead of the right . I suppose all these inquiries of mine , and the consequent curiosity excited in the minds of my friends , made us blind and deaf to what was going on around us . It seemed to me as if the sun rose and shone , and as if the rain rained on Cranford , just as usual , and I did not notice any sign of the times that could be considered as a prognostic of any uncommon event ; and , to the best of my belief , not only Miss Matty and Mrs Forrester , but even Miss Pole herself , whom we looked upon as a kind of prophetess , from the knack she had of foreseeing things before they came to pass — although she did not like to disturb her friends by telling them her foreknowledge — even Miss Pole herself was breathless with astonishment when she came to tell us of the astounding piece of news . But I must recover myself ; the contemplation of it , even at this distance of time , has taken away my breath and my grammar , and unless I subdue my emotion , my spelling will go too . We were sitting — Miss Matty and I — much as usual , she in the blue chintz easy - chair , with her back to the light , and her knitting in her hand , I reading aloud the _ St James ’s Chronicle _ . A few minutes more , and we should have gone to make the little alterations in dress usual before calling - time ( twelve o’clock ) in Cranford . I remember the scene and the date well . We had been talking of the signor ’s rapid recovery since the warmer weather had set in , and praising Mr Hoggins ’s skill , and lamenting his want of refinement and manner ( it seems a curious coincidence that this should have been our subject , but so it was ) , when a knock was heard — a caller ’s knock — three distinct taps — and we were flying ( that is to say , Miss Matty could not walk very fast , having had a touch of rheumatism ) to our rooms , to change cap and collars , when Miss Pole arrested us by calling out , as she came up the stairs , “
59631	59687	59625	59625	I	0	” We did our best to look as if it was not we who had made the hurried movement , the sound of which she had heard ; for , of course , we did not like to have it supposed that we had any old clothes that it was convenient to wear out in the “
59692	59777	59780	59780	you	1490	” as Miss Jenkyns once prettily called the back parlour , where she was tying up preserves . So we threw our gentility with double force into our manners , and very genteel we were for two minutes while Miss Pole recovered breath , and excited our curiosity strongly by lifting up her hands in amazement , and bringing them down in silence , as if what she had to say was too big for words , and could only be expressed by pantomime . “

60365	60384	60386	60387	Miss Matty	98	“ Oh ! I do n’t know . Mr Hoggins is rich , and very pleasant - looking , ”
60389	60400	60386	60387	Miss Matty	98	“ and very good - tempered and kind - hearted . ”

Mine is a very civil invitation , signed ‘ Edwin Wilson , ’ asking me to attend an important meeting of the shareholders of the Town and County Bank , to be held in Drumble , on Thursday the twenty - first . I am sure , it is very attentive of them to remember me . ”
62904	62908	62896	62896	I	0	“ important meeting , ”
62983	63132	62980	62980	she	1583	“ I remember their sending one to Deborah just like this ; but that I did not wonder at , for everybody knew she was so clear - headed . I am afraid I could not help them much ; indeed , if they came to accounts , I should be quite in the way , for I never could do sums in my head . Deborah , I know , rather wished to go , and went so far as to order a new bonnet for the occasion : but when the time came she had a bad cold ; so they sent her a very polite account of what they had done . Chosen a director , I think it was . Do you think they want me to help them to choose a director ? I am sure I should choose your father at once ! ”
63133	63143	63145	63145	I.	1585	“ My father has no shares in the bank , ”
63146	63199	63145	63145	I.	1585	“ Oh , no ! I remember . He objected very much to Deborah ’s buying any , I believe . But she was quite the woman of business , and always judged for herself ; and here , you see , they have paid eight per cent . all these years . ”
63241	63247	63248	63248	she	1586	“ Well , my dear , ”
63251	63428	63248	63248	she	1586	“ the thing is this : it is not etiquette to go till after twelve ; but then , you see , all Cranford will be there , and one does not like to be too curious about dress and trimmings and caps with all the world looking on . It is never genteel to be over - curious on these occasions . Deborah had the knack of always looking as if the latest fashion was nothing new to her ; a manner she had caught from Lady Arley , who did see all the new modes in London , you know . So I thought we would just slip down this morning , soon after breakfast — for I do want half - a - pound of tea — and then we could go up and examine the things at our leisure , and see exactly how my new silk gown must be made ; and then , after twelve , we could go with our minds disengaged , and free from thoughts of dress . ”

64159	64199	64149	64149	she	98	“ it would give me a great deal of trouble to take care of them if I had them ; so , I think , I ’ll only take one . But which must it be , my dear ? ”

I will just step and ask Mr Johnson , sir ; but I ’m afraid I must trouble you for payment in cash , or in a note of a different bank . ”
64452	64456	64458	64458	he	1614	“ Dang it ! ”

64856	64863	64818	64818	she	98	“ Is this a forged note ? ”
64864	64924	64818	64818	she	98	“ Oh , no , ma’am . It is a true note of its kind ; but you see , ma’am , it is a joint - stock bank , and there are reports out that it is likely to break . Mr Johnson is only doing his duty , ma’am , as I am sure Mr Dobson knows . ”
64964	64973	64975	64975	he	250	“ It ’s hard upon a poor man , ”
64977	65046	64975	64975	he	250	“ as earns every farthing with the sweat of his brow . However , there ’s no help for it . You must take back your shawl , my man ; Lizzle must go on with her cloak for a while .

65068	65105	65065	65066	Miss Matty	98	“ I think there is some great mistake about it , for I am one of the shareholders , and I ’m sure they would have told me if things had not been going on right . ”

65137	65180	65182	65182	she	98	“ But I do n’t pretend to understand business ; I only know that if it is going to fail , and if honest people are to lose their money because they have taken our notes — I ca n’t explain myself , ”
65201	65217	65188	65188	she	98	“ only I would rather exchange my gold for the note , if you please , ”
65223	65246	65247	65247	she	98	“ and then you can take your wife the shawl . It is only going without my gown a few days longer , ”
65254	65268	65247	65247	she	98	“ Then , I have no doubt , everything will be cleared up . ”
65269	65280	65282	65282	I.	0	“ But if it is cleared up the wrong way ? ”
65283	65362	65282	65282	I.	0	“ Why , then it will only have been common honesty in me , as a shareholder , to have given this good man the money . I am quite clear about it in my own mind ; but , you know , I can never speak quite as comprehensibly as others can , only you must give me your note , Mr Dobson , if you please , and go on with your purchases with these sovereigns . ”
65413	65475	65399	65399	he	424	“ I ’m loth to make another one lose instead of me , if it is a loss ; but , you see , five pounds is a deal of money to a man with a family ; and , as you say , ten to one in a day or two the note will be as good as gold again . ”

65490	65500	65502	65503	Miss Matty	98	“ The more reason why I should take it , ”
65523	65559	65506	65506	She	98	“ Thank you . I will wait a day or two before I purchase any of these silks ; perhaps you will then have a greater choice . My dear , will you come upstairs ? ”
66171	66339	66153	66153	she	98	“ My dear , I never feel as if my mind was what people call very strong ; and it ’s often hard enough work for me to settle what I ought to do with the case right before me . I was very thankful to — I was very thankful , that I saw my duty this morning , with the poor man standing by me ; but it ’s rather a strain upon me to keep thinking and thinking what I should do if such and such a thing happened ; and , I believe , I had rather wait and see what really does come ; and I do n’t doubt I shall be helped then if I do n’t fidget myself , and get too anxious beforehand . You know , love , I ’m not like Deborah . If Deborah had lived , I ’ve no doubt she would have seen after them , before they had got themselves into this state . ”
66503	66537	66493	66493	she	98	“ If that bank goes wrong , I shall lose one hundred and forty - nine pounds thirteen shillings and fourpence a year ; I shall only have thirteen pounds a year left . ”
66596	66642	66593	66593	she	98	“ I hope it ’s not wrong — not wicked — but , oh ! I am so glad poor Deborah is spared this . She could not have borne to come down in the world — she had such a noble , lofty spirit . ”
66746	66919	66920	66920	She	1661	“ I do n’t mean to deny that men are troublesome in a house . I do n’t judge from my own experience , for my father was neatness itself , and wiped his shoes on coming in as carefully as any woman ; but still a man has a sort of knowledge of what should be done in difficulties , that it is very pleasant to have one at hand ready to lean upon . Now , Lady Glenmire , instead of being tossed about , and wondering where she is to settle , will be certain of a home among pleasant and kind people , such as our good Miss Pole and Mrs Forrester . And Mr Hoggins is really a very personable man ; and as for his manners , why , if they are not very polished , I have known people with very good hearts and very clever minds too , who were not what some people reckoned refined , but who were both true and tender . ”

67122	67213	67116	67116	she	98	“ I believe I am crying for the very silly thought of how my mother would grieve if she could know ; she always cared for us so much more than for herself . But many a poor person has less , and I am not very extravagant , and , thank God , when the neck of mutton , and Martha ’s wages , and the rent are paid , I have not a farthing owing . Poor Martha ! I think she ’ll be sorry to leave me . ”
67752	67876	67746	67747	Miss Matty	98	“ I ’ll never leave her ! No ; I wo n’t . I telled her so , and said I could not think how she could find in her heart to give me warning . I could not have had the face to do it , if I ’d been her . I might ha ’ been just as good for nothing as Mrs Fitz - Adam ’s Rosy , who struck for wages after living seven years and a half in one place . I said I was not one to go and serve Mammon at that rate ; that I knew when I ’d got a good missus , if she did n’t know when she ’d got a good servant ”

67947	68031	67928	67928	she	1679	“ Reason always means what someone else has got to say . Now I think what I ’ve got to say is good enough reason ; but reason or not , I ’ll say it , and I ’ll stick to it . I ’ve money in the Savings Bank , and I ’ve a good stock of clothes , and I ’m not going to leave Miss Matty . No , not if she gives me warning every hour in the day ! ”

68174	68247	68171	68171	Martha	98	“ Still , she will have so little — so very little — to live upon , that I do n’t see just now how she could find you food — she will even be pressed for her own . I tell you this , Martha , because I feel you are like a friend to dear Miss Matty , but you know she might not like to have it spoken about . ”
68312	68414	68296	68296	she	98	“ Was that the reason Miss Matty would n’t order a pudding to - day ? She said she had no great fancy for sweet things , and you and she would just have a mutton chop . But I ’ll be up to her . Never you tell , but I ’ll make her a pudding , and a pudding she ’ll like , too , and I ’ll pay for it myself ; so mind you see she eats it . Many a one has been comforted in their sorrow by seeing a good dish come upon the table . ”

And please , ma’am , we want to take a lodger — just one quiet lodger , to make our two ends meet ; and we ’d take any house conformable ; and , oh dear Miss Matty , if I may be so bold , would you have any objections to lodging with us ? Jem wants it as much as I do . ”
70365	70407	70271	70273	Miss Matilda Jenkyns	86	“ You great oaf ! why ca n’t you back me!—But he does want it all the same , very bad — don’t you , Jem?—only , you see , he ’s dazed at being called on to speak before quality . ”

70654	70680	70682	70682	Jem	133	“ Ay ! if Miss Matty would lodge with us — otherwise I ’ve no mind to be cumbered with strange folk in the house , ”

70961	71094	70952	70952	he	133	“ I hope , ma’am , you know that I am bound to respect every one who has been kind to Martha . I always looked on her as to be my wife — some time ; and she has often and often spoken of you as the kindest lady that ever was ; and though the plain truth is , I would not like to be troubled with lodgers of the common run , yet if , ma’am , you ’d honour us by living with us , I ’m sure Martha would do her best to make you comfortable ; and I ’d keep out of your way as much as I could , which I reckon would be the best kindness such an awkward chap as me could do . ”

And our object in requesting you to meet us this morning is that , believing you are the daughter — that your father is , in fact , her confidential adviser , in all pecuniary matters , we imagined that , by consulting with him , you might devise some mode in which our contribution could be made to appear the legal due which Miss Matilda Jenkyns ought to receive from — — Probably your father , knowing her investments , can fill up the blank . ”

For my father , though well - to - do , would always make me go on as my mother had done before me , and I had to come into Cranford every Saturday , and see after sales , and prices , and what not . And one day , I remember , I met Miss Matty in the lane that leads to Combehurst ; she was walking on the footpath , which , you know , is raised a good way above the road , and a gentleman rode beside her , and was talking to her , and she was looking down at some primroses she had gathered , and pulling them all to pieces , and I do believe she was crying . But after she had passed , she turned round and ran after me to ask — oh , so kindly — about my poor mother , who lay on her death - bed ; and when I cried she took hold of my hand to comfort me — and the gentleman waiting for her all the time — and her poor heart very full of something , I am sure ; and I thought it such an honour to be spoken to in that pretty way by the rector ’s daughter , who visited at Arley Hall . I have loved her ever since , though perhaps I ’d no right to do it ; but if you can think of any way in which I might be allowed to give a little more without any one knowing it , I should be so much obliged to you , my dear . And my brother would be delighted to doctor her for nothing — medicines , leeches , and all . I know that he and her ladyship ( my dear , I little thought in the days I was telling you of that I should ever come to be sister - in - law to a ladyship ! ) would do anything for her . We all would . ”

Well , that ’s long years ago ; more than half a life - time , and yet it seems like yesterday ! I do n’t know a fellow I should have liked better as a brother - in - law .

I want everybody to be friends , for it harasses Matty so much to hear of these quarrels . I shall go at it again by - and - by , so you need not look shocked .
