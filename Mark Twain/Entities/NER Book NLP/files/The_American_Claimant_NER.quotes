922	994	909	909	his	303	“ Soft - spirited as you are , Berkeley , I am quite aware that when you have once made up your mind to do a thing which your ideas of honor and justice require you to do , argument and reason are ( for the time being , ) wasted upon you — yes , and ridicule ; persuasion , supplication , and command as well . To my mind — ”
995	1083	1632	1633	the son	304	“ Father , if you will look at it without prejudice , without passion , you must concede that I am not doing a rash thing , a thoughtless , wilful thing , with nothing substantial behind it to justify it . _ I _ did not create the American claimant to the earldom of Rossmore ; I did not hunt for him , did not find him , did not obtrude him upon your notice . He found himself , he injected himself into our lives — ”
1084	1110	1632	1633	the son	304	“ And has made mine a purgatory for ten years with his tiresome letters , his wordy reasonings , his acres of tedious evidence , — ”
1111	1214	1632	1633	the son	304	“ Which you would never read , would never consent to read . Yet in common fairness he was entitled to a hearing . That hearing would either prove he was the rightful earl — in which case our course would be plain — or it would prove that he wasn’t — in which case our course would be equally plain . I have read his evidences , my lord . I have conned them well , studied them patiently and thoroughly . The chain seems to be complete , no important link wanting . I believe he is the rightful earl . ”
1215	1237	1632	1633	the son	304	“ And I a usurper — a — nameless pauper , a tramp ! Consider what you are saying , sir . ”
1238	1280	1632	1633	the son	304	“ Father , _ if _ he is the rightful earl , would you , could you — that fact being established — consent to keep his titles and his properties from him a day , an hour , a minute ? ”
1281	1625	1632	1633	the son	304	“ You are talking nonsense — nonsense — lurid idiocy ! Now , listen to me . I will make a confession — if you wish to call it by that name . I did not read those evidences because I had no occasion to — I was made familiar with them in the time of this claimant ’s father and of my own father forty years ago . This fellow ’s predecessors have kept mine more or less familiar with them for close upon a hundred and fifty years . The truth is , the rightful heir did go to America , with the Fairfax heir or about the same time — but disappeared — somewhere in the wilds of Virginia , got married , and began to breed savages for the Claimant market ; wrote no letters home ; was supposed to be dead ; his younger brother softly took possession ; presently the American did die , and straightway his eldest product put in his claim — by letter — letter still in existence — and died before the uncle in - possession found time — or maybe inclination — to — answer . The infant son of that eldest product grew up — long interval , you see — and _ he _ took to writing letters and furnishing evidences . Well , successor after successor has done the same , down to the present idiot . It was a succession of paupers ; not one of them was ever able to pay his passage to England or institute suit . The Fairfaxes kept their lordship alive , and so they have never lost it to this day , although they live in Maryland ; their friend lost his by his own neglect . You perceive now , that the facts in this case bring us to precisely this result : morally the American tramp _ is _ rightful earl of Rossmore ; legally he has no more right than his dog . There now — are you satisfied ? ”
1655	1696	1652	1652	his	304	“ Since the introduction of heraldic symbols,—the motto of this house has been _ Suum cuique_—to every man his own . By your own intrepidly frank confession , my lord , it is become a sarcasm : If Simon Lathers — ”
1697	1776	1632	1633	the son	304	“ Keep that exasperating name to yourself ! For ten years it has pestered my eye — and tortured my ear ; till at last my very footfalls time themselves to the brain - racking rhythm of _ Simon Lathers!—Simon Lathers ! — Simon Lathers ! _ And now , to make its presence in my soul eternal , immortal , imperishable , you have resolved to — to — what is it you have resolved to do ? ”
1777	1793	1632	1633	the son	304	“ To go to Simon Lathers , in America , and change places with him . ”
1794	1807	1652	1652	his	304	“ What ? Deliver the reversion of the earldom into his hands ? ”
1808	1814	1632	1633	the son	304	“ That is my purpose . ”
1815	1830	1632	1633	the son	304	“ Make this tremendous surrender without even trying the fantastic case in the Lords ? ”

1843	1892	1893	1894	The son	304	“ By all that is amazing , I believe you are insane , my son . See here — have you been training with that ass again — that radical , if you prefer the term , though the words are synonymous — Lord Tanzy , of Tollmache ? ”
1905	1973	1900	1902	the old lord	295	“ Yes , you confess . That puppy , that shame to his birth and caste , who holds all hereditary lordships and privilege to be usurpation , all nobility a tinsel sham , all aristocratic institutions a fraud , all inequalities in rank a legalized crime and an infamy , and no bread honest bread that a man does n’t earn by his own work—_work _ , pah!”—and
1987	1999	1900	1902	the old lord	295	“ You have come to hold just those opinions yourself , I suppose,”—he
2029	2164	2024	2024	he	308	“ I have . I say it without shame — I feel none . And now my reason for resolving to renounce my heirship without resistance is explained . I wish to retire from what to me is a false existence , a false position , and begin my life over again — begin it right — begin it on the level of mere manhood , unassisted by factitious aids , and succeed or fail by pure merit or the want of it . I will go to America , where all men are equal and all have an equal chance ; I will live or die , sink or swim , win or lose as just a man — that alone , and not a single helping gaud or fiction back of it . ”

2231	2372	2213	2213	he	311	“ Well , there will be one satisfaction — Simon Lathers will come here to enter into his own , and I will drown him in the horsepond . The poor devil — always so humble in his letters , so pitiful , so deferential ; so steeped in reverence for our great line and lofty - station ; so anxious to placate us , so prayerful for recognition as a relative , a bearer in his veins of our sacred blood — and withal so poor , so needy , so threadbare and pauper - shod as to raiment , so despised , so laughed at for his silly claimantship by the lewd American scum around him — ah , the vulgar , crawling , insufferable tramp ! To read one of his cringing , nauseating letters — well ? ”
2432	2439	2429	2429	his	313	“ The letters , my lord . ”
2450	2602	2429	2429	his	313	“ Among the rest , an American letter . From the tramp , of course . Jove , but here ’s a change ! No brown paper envelope this time , filched from a shop , and carrying the shop ’s advertisement in the corner . Oh , no , a proper enough envelope — with a most ostentatiously broad mourning border — for his cat , perhaps , since he was a bachelor — and fastened with red wax — a batch of it as big as a half - crown — and — and — our crest for a seal!—motto and all . And the ignorant , sprawling hand is gone ; he sports a secretary , evidently — a secretary with a most confident swing and flourish to his pen . Oh indeed , our fortunes are improving over there — our meek tramp has undergone a metamorphosis . ”

5292	5310	5371	5371	Washington	122	” There was another meditative silence . Then Washington said , with earnest compassion in his voice — “

5347	5366	5402	5402	you	423	” The Colonel had to get up and stand , to get room for his amazement to expand . “
5407	5469	5666	5666	they	442	” It was Washington ’s turn to be amazed . He was stricken dumb ; but the wide - eyed wonder , the reverent admiration expressed in his face were more eloquent than any words could have been . The Colonel ’s wounded spirit was healed and he resumed his seat pleased and content . He leaned forward and said impressively : “

Mrs. Sellers returned , now , with her composure restored , and began to ask after Hawkins ’s wife , and about his children , and the number of them , and so on , and her examination of the witness resulted in a circumstantial history of the family ’s ups and downs and driftings to and fro in the far West during the previous fifteen years . There was a message , now , from out back , and Colonel Sellers went out there in answer to it . Hawkins took this opportunity to ask how the world had been using the Colonel during the past half - generation . “

6965	7305	7772	7772	her	490	“ Here ’s old Dan’l and old Jinny , that the sheriff sold south one of the times that we got bankrupted before the war — they came wandering back after the peace , worn out and used up on the cotton plantations , helpless , and not another lick of work left in their old hides for the rest of this earthly pilgrimage — and we so pinched , _ oh _ so pinched for the very crumbs to keep life in us , and he just flung the door wide , and the way he received them you ’d have thought they had come straight down from heaven in answer to prayer . I took him one side and said , ‘ Mulberry we ca n’t have them — we’ve nothing for ourselves — we ca n’t feed them . ’ He looked at me kind of hurt , and said , ‘ Turn them out?—and they ’ve come to me just as confident and trusting as — as — why Polly , I must have _ bought _ that confidence sometime or other a long time ago , and given my note , so to speak — you do n’t get such things as a _ gift_—and how am I going to go back on a debt like that ? And you see , they ’re so poor , and old , and friendless , and — ’ But I was ashamed by that time , and shut him off , and somehow felt a new courage in me , and so I said , softly , ‘ We ’ll keep them — the Lord will provide . ’ He was glad , and started to blurt out one of those over - confident speeches of his , but checked himself in time , and said humbly , ‘ _ I _ will , anyway . ’ It was years and years and years ago . Well , you see those old wrecks are here yet . ”
7306	7315	7772	7772	her	490	“ But do n’t they do your housework ? ”
7316	7453	7912	7912	she	491	“ Laws ! The idea . They would if they could , poor old things , and perhaps they think they _ do _ do some of it . But it ’s a superstition . Dan’l waits on the front door , and sometimes goes on an errand ; and sometimes you ’ll see one or both of them letting on to dust around in here — but that ’s because there ’s something they want to hear about and mix their gabble into . And they ’re always around at meals , for the same reason . But the fact is , we have to keep a young negro girl just to take care of _ them _ , and a negro woman to do the housework and _ help _ take care of them . ”
7454	7468	7772	7772	her	490	“ Well , they ought to be tolerably happy , I should think . ”
7469	7636	7772	7772	her	490	“ It ’s no name for it . They quarrel together pretty much all the time — most always about religion , because Dan’l ’s a Dunker Baptist and Jinny ’s a shouting Methodist , and Jinny believes in special Providences and Dan’l do n’t , because he thinks he ’s a kind of a free - thinker — and they play and sing plantation hymns together , and talk and chatter just eternally and forever , and are sincerely fond of each other and think the world of Mulberry , and he puts up patiently with all their spoiled ways and foolishness , and so — ah , well , they ’re happy enough if it comes to that . And I do n’t mind — I’ve got used to it . I can get used to anything , with Mulberry to help ; and the fact is , I do n’t much care what happens , so long as he ’s spared to me . ”
7637	7654	7912	7912	she	491	“ Well , here ’s to him , and hoping he ’ll make another strike soon . ”
7655	7715	7772	7772	her	490	“ And rake in the lame , the halt and the blind , and turn the house into a hospital again ? It ’s what he would do . I ’ve seen aplenty of that and more . No , Washington , I want his strikes to be mighty moderate ones the rest of the way down the vale . ”
7716	7761	7770	7770	she	490	“ Well , then , big strike or little strike , or no strike at all , here ’s hoping he ’ll never lack for friends — and I do n’t reckon he ever will while there ’s people around who know enough to — ”
7762	7768	7912	7912	she	491	“ Him lack for friends ! ”
7778	7907	7912	7912	she	491	pride—“why , Washington , you ca n’t name a man that ’s anybody that is n’t fond of him . I ’ll tell you privately , that I ’ve had Satan ’s own time to keep them from appointing him to some office or other . They knew he ’d no business with an office , just as well as I did , but he ’s the hardest man to refuse anything to a body ever saw . Mulberry Sellers with an office ! laws goodness , you know what that would be like . Why , they ’d come from the ends of the earth to see a circus like that . I ’d just as lieves be married to Niagara Falls , and done with it . ”
7932	7976	8011	8011	he	114	“ Friends?—oh , indeed , no man ever had more ; and _ such _ friends : Grant , Sherman , Sheridan , Johnston , Longstreet , Lee — many ’s the time they ’ve sat in that chair you ’re sitting in — ”
8005	8010	8030	8030	He	114	“ _ They ! _ ”
8014	8029	8404	8404	she	495	“ Oh , indeed , yes , a many and a many a time . ”

8139	8320	8404	8404	she	495	“ Oh , they like to hear him talk , especially if their load is getting rather heavy on one shoulder and they want to shift it . He ’s all air , you know,—breeze , you may say — and he freshens them up ; it ’s a trip to the country , they say . Many a time he ’s made General Grant laugh — and that ’s a tidy job , I can tell you , and as for Sheridan , his eye lights up and he listens to Mulberry Sellers the same as if he was artillery . You see , the charm about Mulberry is , he is so catholic and unprejudiced that he fits in anywhere and everywhere . It makes him powerful good company , and as popular as scandal . You go to the White House when the President ’s holding a general reception — sometime when Mulberry ’s there . Why , dear me , _ you _ ca n’t tell which of them it is that ’s holding that reception . ”
8321	8340	8404	8404	she	495	“ Well , he certainly is a remarkable man — and he always was . Is he religious ? ”
8341	8377	8404	8404	she	495	“ Clear to his marrow — does more thinking and reading on that subject than any other except Russia and Siberia : thrashes around over the whole field , too ; nothing bigoted about him . ”
8378	8384	8389	8389	She	495	“ What is his religion ? ”

8498	8513	8514	8514	Washington	114	“ Oh , it ’s just a trifle . Toy to amuse the children . ”
8518	8526	8481	8482	the Colonel	374	“ It seems to be a puzzle . ”
8527	8558	8514	8514	Washington	114	“ Yes , that ’s what it is . I call it Pigs in the Clover . Put them in — see if you can put them in the pen . ”
8573	8608	8514	8514	Washington	114	“ It ’s wonderfully ingenious , Colonel , it ’s ever so clever and interesting — why , I could play with it all day . What are you going to do with it ? ”
8609	8621	8514	8514	Washington	114	“ Oh , nothing . Patent it and throw it aside . ”
8622	8639	8651	8651	he	374	“ Do n’t you do anything of the kind . There ’s money in that thing . ”
8654	8673	8674	8674	Washington	114	“ Money — yes ; pin money : a couple of hundred thousand , perhaps . Not more . ”
8679	8694	8719	8719	his	374	“ A couple of hundred thousand dollars ! do you call that pin money ? ”
8733	8740	8746	8746	he	114	“ You can keep a secret ? ”
8753	8765	8746	8746	he	114	“ You have heard of materialization — materialization of departed spirits ? ”
8772	8948	8730	8730	his	374	“ And probably did n’t believe in it ; and quite right , too . The thing as practised by ignorant charlatans is unworthy of attention or respect — where there ’s a dim light and a dark cabinet , and a parcel of sentimental gulls gathered together , with their faith and their shudders and their tears all ready , and one and the same fatty degeneration of protoplasm and humbug comes out and materializes himself into anybody you want , grandmother , grandchild , brother - in - law , Witch of Endor , John Milton , Siamese twins , Peter the Great , and all such frantic nonsense — no , that is all foolish and pitiful . But when a man that is competent brings the vast powers of _ science _ to bear , it ’s a different matter , a totally different matter , you see . The spectre that answers _ that _ call has come to stay . Do you note the commercial value of that detail ? ”
8949	9000	8730	8730	his	374	“ Well , I — the — the truth is , that I do n’t quite know that I do . Do you mean that such , being permanent , not transitory , would give more general satisfaction , and so enhance the price — of tickets to the show — ”
9001	9103	8730	8730	his	374	“ Show ? Folly — listen to me ; and get a good grip on your breath , for you are going to need it . Within three days I shall have completed my method , and then — let the world stand aghast , for it shall see marvels . Washington , within three days — ten at the outside — you shall see me call the dead of any century , and they will arise and walk . Walk?—they shall walk forever , and never die again . Walk with all the muscle and spring of their pristine vigor . ”
9104	9116	8730	8730	his	374	“ Colonel ! Indeed it does take one ’s breath away . ”
9117	9131	8730	8730	his	374	“ _ Now _ do you see the money that ’s in it ? ”
9132	9146	8730	8730	his	374	“ I’m — well , I’m — not really sure that I do . ”
9147	9200	8730	8730	his	374	“ Great Scott , look here . I shall have a monopoly ; they ’ll all belong to me , wo n’t they ? Two thousand policemen in the city of New York . Wages , four dollars a day . I ’ll replace them with dead ones at half the money . ”
9201	9237	8730	8730	his	374	“ Oh , prodigious ! I never thought of that . F - o - u - r thousand dollars a day . Now I do begin to see ! But will dead policemen answer ? ”
9238	9248	8730	8730	his	374	“ Have n’t they — up to this time ? ”
9249	9259	8730	8730	his	374	“ Well , if you put it that way — ”
9260	9361	8730	8730	his	374	“ Put it any way you want to . Modify it to suit yourself , and my lads shall still be superior . They wo n’t eat , they wo n’t drink — don’t need those things ; they wo n’t wink for cash at gambling dens and unlicensed rum - holes , they wo n’t spark the scullery maids ; and moreover the bands of toughs that ambuscade them on lonely beats , and cowardly shoot and knife them will only damage the uniforms and not live long enough to get more than a momentary satisfaction out of that . ”
9362	9377	8730	8730	his	374	“ Why , Colonel , if you can furnish policemen , then of course — ”
9378	9614	8730	8730	his	374	“ Certainly — I can furnish any line of goods that ’s wanted . Take the army , for instance — now twenty - five thousand men ; expense , twenty - two millions a year . I will dig up the Romans , I will resurrect the Greeks , I will furnish the government , for ten millions a year , ten thousand veterans drawn from the victorious legions of all the ages — soldiers that will chase Indians year in and year out on materialized horses , and cost never a cent for rations or repairs . The armies of Europe cost two billions a year now — I will replace them all for a billion . I will dig up the trained statesmen of all ages and all climes , and furnish this country with a Congress that knows enough to come in out of the rain — a thing that ’s never happened yet , since the Declaration of Independence , and never will happen till these practically dead people are replaced with the genuine article . I will restock the thrones of Europe with the best brains and the best morals that all the royal sepulchres of all the centuries can furnish — which is n’t promising very much — and I ’ll divide the wages and the civil list , fair and square , merely taking my half and — ”
9615	9634	8730	8730	his	374	“ Colonel , if the half of this is true , there ’s millions in it — millions . ”
9635	9705	9713	9716	An energetic looking man	505	“ Billions in it — billions ; that ’s what you mean . Why , look here ; the thing is so close at hand , so imminent , so absolutely immediate , that if a man were to come to me now and say , Colonel , I am a little short , and if you could lend me a couple of billion dollars for — come in ! ”
9743	9769	9770	9771	The Colonel	374	“ Seventeenth and last call — you want to out with that three dollars and forty cents this time without fail , Colonel Mulberry Sellers . ”
9791	9829	9855	9855	Washington	114	“ What _ have _ I done with that wallet?—let me see — um — not here , not there — Oh , I must have left it in the kitchen ; I ’ll just run and — ”
9830	9854	9867	9868	the Colonel	374	“ No you won’t — you’ll stay right where you are . And you ’re going to disgorge , too — this time . ”
9871	9900	9919	9920	The Colonel	95	“ The fact is , I ’ve got to throw myself on your indulgence just this once more , Suggs ; you see the remittances I was expecting — ”
9901	9918	9951	9951	he	95	“ Hang the remittances — it ’s too stale — it wo n’t answer . Come ! ”
9968	9989	9932	9932	he	95	“ Take it , but do n’t let me see it go . It ’s the sole remaining Rembrandt that — ”
9990	10000	9932	9932	he	95	“ Rembrandt be damned , it ’s a chromo . ”
10001	10035	10048	10049	The colonel	374	“ Oh , do n’t speak of it so , I beg you . It ’s the only really great original , the only supreme example of that mighty school of art which — ”
10036	10047	10048	10049	The colonel	374	“ Art ! It ’s the sickest looking thing I — ”
10060	10079	10114	10114	he	95	“ Take this one too — the gem of my collection — the only genuine Fra Angelico that — ”
10080	10112	10120	10121	the Colonel	374	“ Illuminated liver - pad , that ’s what it is . Give it here — good day — people will think I ’ve robbed a ’ nigger barber - shop . ”
10128	10150	10212	10213	The Colonel	374	“ Do please cover them up — don’t let the damp get at them . The delicate tints in the Angelico — ”
10221	10225	10212	10213	The Colonel	374	“ What man ? ”
10226	10251	10320	10324	a man on the train	515	“ One - armed Pete they call him out there — out in the Cherokee country I mean . Robbed the bank in Tahlequah . ”
10252	10260	10212	10213	The Colonel	374	“ Do they have banks in Tahlequah ? ”
10261	10308	10212	10213	The Colonel	374	“ Yes—_a _ bank , anyway . He was suspected of robbing it . Whoever did it got away with more than twenty thousand dollars . They offered a reward of five thousand . I believe I saw that very man , on my way east . ”

10730	10851	10720	10720	them	524	” CHAPTER IV . p051.jpg ( 17 K ) The day wore itself out . After dinner the two friends put in a long and harassing evening trying to decide what to do with the five thousand dollars reward which they were going to get when they should find One - Armed Pete , and catch him , and prove him to be the right person , and extradite him , and ship him to Tahlequah in the Indian Territory . But there were so many dazzling openings for ready cash that they found it impossible to make up their minds and keep them made up . Finally , Mrs. Sellers grew very weary of it all , and said : “
10865	11020	10720	10720	them	524	” Then the matter was dropped , for the time being , and all went to bed . Next morning , being persuaded by Hawkins , the colonel made drawings and specifications and went down and applied for a patent for his toy puzzle , and Hawkins took the toy itself and started out to see what chance there might be to do something with it commercially . He did not have to go far . In a small old wooden shanty which had once been occupied as a dwelling by some humble negro family he found a keen - eyed Yankee engaged in repairing cheap chairs and other second - hand furniture . This man examined the toy indifferently ; attempted to do the puzzle ; found it not so easy as he had expected ; grew more interested , and finally emphatically so ; achieved a success at last , and asked : “
11025	11026	10720	10720	them	524	” “
11031	11032	11039	11039	you	525	” “
11044	11045	11039	11039	you	525	” “
11052	11053	11039	11039	you	525	” “
11065	11066	11069	11069	you	525	” “
11076	11077	11103	11103	I	0	” “
11121	11139	11103	11103	I	0	” Washington sighed . Another dream disappeared ; no money in the thing . So he said : “
11153	11252	11314	11315	my lady	529	” He went his way with the paper , and dropped the matter out of his mind dropped it out to make room for further attempts to think out the most promising way to invest his half of the reward , in case a partnership investment satisfactory to both beneficiaries could not be hit upon . He had not been very long at home when Sellers arrived sodden with grief and booming with glad excitement — working both these emotions successfully , sometimes separately , sometimes together . He fell on Hawkins ’s neck sobbing , and said : “
11283	11305	11314	11315	my lady	529	” He turned to his wife , who had entered while this was going on , put his arms about her and said—“You
11326	11336	11372	11372	I	0	” She bore up very well , and said : “
11365	11371	11414	11414	her	532	” The rightful earl continued : “
11417	11418	11422	11423	Lady Gwendolen	144	” “
11425	11426	11438	11439	Sally Sellers	144	” “

11450	11451	11491	11492	Lady Rossmore	145	” “

11591	11592	11629	11629	your	118	” “
11620	11621	11674	11677	my own true wife	542	” “
11670	11671	11691	11691	Gwendolen	144	” “
11687	11688	11756	11756	You	110	” “

11769	11770	11826	11826	her	144	” “
11822	11823	11973	11973	they	558	” “
11970	11971	12038	12038	My	0	” “
12036	12037	12041	12041	Blatherskites	148	” “
12047	12048	12136	12136	He	563	” “
12134	12135	12144	12144	I	0	” “
12142	12143	12144	12144	I	0	” “
12149	12160	12261	12261	I	0	” my lady muttered , as she left the room . “
12273	12321	12329	12329	you	569	” Uncle Dan’l was sent with the telegram ; for although a conspicuous object in a corner of the drawing - room was a telephone hanging on a transmitter , Washington found all attempts to raise the central office vain . The Colonel grumbled something about its being “
12339	12725	12866	12866	I	0	” but he did n’t explain that one of the reasons for this was that the thing was only a dummy and had n’t any wire attached to it . And yet the Colonel often used it — when visitors were present — and seemed to get messages through it . Mourning paper and a seal were ordered , then the friends took a rest . Next afternoon , while Hawkins , by request , draped Andrew Jackson ’s portrait with crape , the rightful earl , wrote off the family bereavement to the usurper in England — a letter which we have already read . He also , by letter to the village authorities at Duffy ’s Corners , Arkansas , gave order that the remains of the late twins be embalmed by some St. Louis expert and shipped at once to the usurper — with bill . Then he drafted out the Rossmore arms and motto on a great sheet of brown paper , and he and Hawkins took it to Hawkins ’s Yankee furniture - mender and at the end of an hour came back with a couple of stunning hatchments , which they nailed up on the front of the house — attractions calculated to draw , and they did ; for it was mainly an idle and shiftless negro neighborhood , with plenty of ragged children and indolent dogs to spare for a point of interest like that , and keep on sparing them for it , days and days together . The new earl found — without surprise — this society item in the evening paper , and cut it out and scrapbooked it : By a recent bereavement our esteemed fellow citizen , Colonel Mulberry Sellers , Perpetual Member - at - large of the Diplomatic Body , succeeds , as rightful lord , to the great earldom of Rossmore , third by order of precedence in the earldoms of Great Britain , and will take early measures , by suit in the House of Lords , to wrest the title and estates from the present usurping holder of them . Until the season of mourning is past , the usual Thursday evening receptions at Rossmore Towers will be discontinued . Lady Rossmore ’s comment — to herself : “
12872	12882	12905	12905	I	0	” The rightful earl ’s comment — to himself : “
12915	12966	13048	13048	she	576	” CHAPTER V. No answer to that telegram ; no arriving daughter . Yet nobody showed any uneasiness or seemed surprised ; that is , nobody but Washington . After three days of waiting , he asked Lady Rossmore what she supposed the trouble was . She answered , tranquilly : “
13064	13323	13326	13328	Lady Gwendolen Sellers	580	” It turned out to be a letter . It was handed in at that moment , and was received by the mother without trembling hands or feverish eagerness , or any other of the manifestations common in the case of long delayed answers to imperative telegrams . She polished her glasses with tranquility and thoroughness , pleasantly gossiping along , the while , then opened the letter and began to read aloud : KENILWORTH KEEP , REDGAUNTLET HALL , ROWENA - IVANHOE COLLEGE , THURSDAY . DEAR PRECIOUS MAMMA ROSSMORE : Oh , the joy of it!—you ca n’t think . They had always turned up their noses at our pretentions , you know ; and I had fought back as well as I could by turning up mine at theirs . They always said it might be something great and fine to be the rightful Shadow of an earldom , but to merely be shadow _ of _ a shadow , and two or three times removed at that — pooh - pooh ! And I always retorted that not to be able to show four generations of American - Colonial - Dutch Peddler - and - Salt - Cod - McAllister - Nobility might be endurable , but to _ have _ to confess such an origin — pfew - few ! Well , the telegram , it was just a cyclone ! The messenger came right into the great Rob Roy Hall of Audience , as excited as he could be , singing out , “
13330	13964	13326	13328	Lady Gwendolen Sellers	580	” and you ought to have seen that simpering chattering assemblage of pinchbeck aristocrats , turn to stone ! I was off in the corner , of course , by myself — it ’s where Cinderella belongs . I took the telegram and read it , and tried to faint — and I could have done it if I had had any preparation , but it was all so sudden , you know — but no matter , I did the next best thing : I put my handkerchief to my eyes and fled sobbing to my room , dropping the telegram as I started . I released one corner of my eye a moment — just enough to see the herd swarm for the telegram — and then continued my broken - hearted flight just as happy as a bird . Then the visits of condolence began , and I had to accept the loan of Miss Augusta - Templeton - Ashmore Hamilton ’s quarters because the press was so great and there is n’t room for three and a cat in mine . And I ’ve been holding a Lodge of Sorrow ever since and defending myself against people ’s attempts to claim kin . And do you know , the very first girl to fetch her tears and sympathy to my market was that foolish Skimperton girl who has always snubbed me so shamefully and claimed lordship and precedence of the whole college because some ancestor of hers , some time or other , was a McAllister . Why it was like the bottom bird in the menagerie putting on airs because its head ancestor was a pterodactyl . But the ger - reatest triumph of all was — guess . But you ’ll never . This is it . That little fool and two others have always been fussing and fretting over which was entitled to precedence — by rank , you know . They ’ve nearly starved themselves at it ; for each claimed the right to take precedence of all the college in leaving the table , and so neither of them ever finished her dinner , but broke off in the middle and tried to get out ahead of the others . Well , after my first day ’s grief and seclusion — I was fixing up a mourning dress you see — I appeared at the public table again , and then — what do you think ? Those three fluffy goslings sat there contentedly , and squared up the long famine — lapped and lapped , munched and munched , ate and ate , till the gravy appeared in their eyes — humbly waiting for the Lady Gwendolen to take precedence and move out first , you see ! Oh , yes , I ’ve been having a darling good time . And do you know , not one of these collegians has had the cruelty to ask me how I came by my new name . With some , this is due to charity , but with the others it is n’t . They refrain , not from native kindness but from educated discretion . I educated them . Well , as soon as I shall have settled up what ’s left of the old scores and snuffed up a few more of those pleasantly intoxicating clouds of incense , I shall pack and depart homeward . Tell papa I am as fond of him as I am of my new name . I could n’t put it stronger than that . What an inspiration it was ! But inspirations come easy to him . These , from your loving daughter , GWENDOLEN . Hawkins reached for the letter and glanced over it . “
13968	13972	13986	13986	She	581	” he said , “
13994	13995	14029	14029	Sellerses	134	” “
14071	14200	14029	14029	Sellerses	134	” The seventh day after the date of the telegram Washington came dreaming down to breakfast and was set wide awake by an electrical spasm of pleasure . Here was the most beautiful young creature he had ever seen in his life . It was Sally Sellers Lady Gwendolen ; she had come in the night . And it seemed to him that her clothes were the prettiest and the daintiest he had ever looked upon , and the most exquisitely contrived and fashioned and combined , as to decorative trimmings , and fixings , and melting harmonies of color . It was only a morning dress , and inexpensive , but he confessed to himself , in the English common to Cherokee Strip , that it was a “
14203	14270	14317	14317	him	588	” And now , as he perceived , the reason why the Sellers household poverties and sterilities had been made to blossom like the rose , and charm the eye and satisfy the spirit , stood explained ; here was the magician ; here in the midst of her works , and furnishing in her own person the proper accent and climaxing finish of the whole . “
14319	14320	14323	14323	father	1758	” “
14331	14332	14354	14354	I	0	” “
14351	14352	14366	14366	I	0	” “
14364	14365	14384	14385	the man	511	” “
14381	14382	14420	14422	that poor sheep	595	” “
14424	14425	14470	14470	Father	1758	” “
14468	14469	14519	14519	I	0	” “
14541	14843	15027	15027	you	144	” and beaming in his face she finished her cordial shake with the hope that he had not forgotten her . p061.jpg ( 29 K ) He was prodigiously pleased by her outspoken heartiness , and wanted to repay her by assuring her that he remembered her , and not only that but better even than he remembered his own children , but the facts would not quite warrant this ; still , he stumbled through a tangled sentence which answered just as well , since the purport of it was an awkward and unintentional confession that her extraordinary beauty had so stupefied him that he had n’t got back to his bearings , yet , and therefore could n’t be certain as to whether he remembered her at all or not . The speech made him her friend ; it could n’t well help it . In truth the beauty of this fair creature was of a rare type , and may well excuse a moment of our time spent in its consideration . It did not consist in the _ fact _ that she had eyes , nose , mouth , chin , hair , ears , it consisted in their arrangement . In true beauty , more depends upon right location and judicious distribution of feature than upon multiplicity of them . So also as regards color . The very combination of colors which in a volcanic irruption would add beauty to a landscape might detach it from a girl . Such was Gwendolen Sellers . The family circle being completed by Gwendolen ’s arrival , it was decreed that the official mourning should now begin ; that it should begin at six o’clock every evening , ( the dinner hour , ) and end with the dinner . “
15031	15032	15061	15061	she	163	” “
15071	15072	15109	15109	I	0	” “
15107	15108	15119	15120	Mr. Rossm	164	” “
15124	15125	15119	15120	Mr. Rossm	164	” “
15153	15201	15220	15221	the man	511	” A. TO YOU KNOW WHO . Think I know you . Wait ten days . Coming to Washington . The excitement died out of both men ’s faces . There was a brooding silence for a while , then the younger one said with a sigh : “
15216	15217	15220	15221	the man	511	” “
15236	15237	15220	15221	the man	511	” “
15263	15264	15305	15305	we	611	” “
15317	15318	15305	15305	we	611	” “
15328	15329	15453	15453	I	0	” “
15386	15452	15524	15524	They	615	” Between them they framed twenty - two different advertisements , but none was satisfactory . A main fault in all of them was urgency . That feature was very troublesome : if made prominent , it was calculated to excite Pete ’s suspicion ; if modified below the suspicion - point it was flat and meaningless . Finally the Colonel resigned , and said : “
15528	16164	16165	16165	She	616	” Then Hawkins resigned also , and the two agreed that they must manage to wait the ten days some how or other . Next , they caught a ray of cheer : since they had something definite to go upon , now , they could probably borrow money on the reward — enough , at any rate , to tide them over till they got it ; and meantime the materializing recipe would be perfected , and then good bye to trouble for good and all . The next day , May the tenth , a couple of things happened — among others . The remains of the noble Arkansas twins left our shores for England , consigned to Lord Rossmore , and Lord Rossmore ’s son , Kirkcudbright Llanover Marjoribanks Sellers Viscount Berkeley , sailed from Liverpool for America to place the reversion of the earldom in the hands of the rightful peer , Mulberry Sellers , of Rossmore Towers in the District of Columbia , U. S. A. These two impressive shipments would meet and part in mid - Atlantic , five days later , and give no sign . CHAPTER VI . In the course of time the twins arrived and were delivered to their great kinsman . To try to describe the rage of that old man would profit nothing , the attempt would fall so far short of the purpose . However when he had worn himself out and got quiet again , he looked the matter over and decided that the twins had some moral rights , although they had no legal ones ; they were of his blood , and it could not be decorous to treat them as common clay . So he laid them with their majestic kin in the Cholmondeley church , with imposing state and ceremony , and added the supreme touch by officiating as chief mourner himself . But he drew the line at hatchments . Our friends in Washington watched the weary days go by , while they waited for Pete and covered his name with reproaches because of his calamitous procrastinations . Meantime , Sally Sellers , who was as practical and democratic as the Lady Gwendolen Sellers was romantic and aristocratic , was leading a life of intense interest and activity and getting the most she could out of her double personality . All day long in the privacy of her work - room , Sally Sellers earned bread for the Sellers family ; and all the evening Lady Gwendolen Sellers supported the Rossmore dignity . All day she was American , practically , and proud of the work of her head and hands and its commercial result ; all the evening she took holiday and dwelt in a rich shadow - land peopled with titled and coroneted fictions . By day , to her , the place was a plain , unaffected , ramshackle old trap — just that , and nothing more ; by night it was Rossmore Towers . At college she had learned a trade without knowing it . The girls had found out that she was the designer of her own gowns . She had no idle moments after that , and wanted none ; for the exercise of an extraordinary gift is the supremest pleasure in life , and it was manifest that Sally Sellers possessed a gift of that sort in the matter of costume - designing . Within three days after reaching home she had hunted up some work ; before Pete was yet due in Washington , and before the twins were fairly asleep in English soil , she was already nearly swamped with work , and the sacrificing of the family chromos for debt had got an effective check . “
16170	16177	16281	16284	Rossmore of the peerage	620	” said Rossmore to the Major ; “
16286	16337	16370	16370	I	0	” The two friends had haunted the general post - office daily . At last they had their reward . Toward evening on the 20th of May , they got a letter for XYZ . It bore the Washington postmark ; the note itself was not dated . It said : “
16373	16387	16392	16392	he	0	” The friends cogitated over the note profoundly . Presently the earl said : “
16403	16404	16392	16392	he	0	” “
16409	16410	16480	16480	himself	0	” “
16487	16488	16526	16526	he	0	” “
16540	16541	16564	16564	he	0	” “
16561	16562	16564	16564	he	0	” “
16566	16567	16599	16599	his	0	” “
16602	16603	16607	16607	you	619	” “
16611	16612	16682	16682	he	0	” “
16700	16707	16730	16730	he	0	” Hawkins turned sick with disappointment : “
16727	16728	16730	16730	he	0	” “
16734	16735	16738	16738	he	0	” “
16742	16743	16777	16778	the officer	640	” “
16797	16798	16811	16811	I	0	” “
16822	16823	16860	16860	I’ll	0	” “
16867	16892	16894	16894	you	452	” They reached the neighborhood of the New Gadsby about nine in the evening , and passed down the alley to the lamp post . “
16897	16920	16927	16927	I	0	” said the colonel , triumphantly , with a wave of his hand which took in the whole side of the hotel . “
16931	16932	16955	16955	you	452	” “
16957	16958	17131	17131	We	648	” “
16999	17130	17172	17172	We	648	” The earl drifted here and there through the swarming lobby , and finally took a waiting position in the neighborhood of the elevator . During an hour crowds went up and crowds came down ; and all complete as to limbs ; but at last the watcher got a glimpse of a figure that was satisfactory — got a glimpse of the back of it , though he had missed his chance at the face through waning alertness . The glimpse revealed a cowboy hat , and below it a plaided sack of rather loud pattern , and an empty sleeve pinned up to the shoulder . Then the elevator snatched the vision aloft and the watcher fled away in joyful excitement , and rejoined the fellow - conspirator . “
17182	17294	17172	17172	We	648	” They got it , after the delays usual in such cases . By half past eleven they were at home and happy , and went to bed full of dreams of the morrow ’s great promise . Among the elevator load which had the suspect for fellow - passenger was a young kinsman of Mulberry Sellers , but Mulberry was not aware of it and did n’t see him . It was Viscount Berkeley . CHAPTER VII . Arrived in his room Lord Berkeley made preparations for that first and last and all - the - time duty of the visiting Englishman — the jotting down in his diary of his “
17296	17306	17172	17172	We	648	” to date . His preparations consisted in ransacking his “
17308	17441	18250	18250	they	663	” for a pen . There was a plenty of steel pens on his table with the ink bottle , but he was English . The English people manufacture steel pens for nineteen - twentieths of the globe , but they never use any themselves . They use exclusively the pre - historic quill . My lord not only found a quill pen , but the best one he had seen in several years — and after writing diligently for some time , closed with the following entry : p071.jpg ( 18 K ) BUT IN ONE THING I HAVE MADE AN IMMENSE MISTAKE , I OUGHT TO HAVE SHUCKED MY TITLE AND CHANGED MY NAME BEFORE I STARTED . He sat admiring that pen a while , and then went on : “
17661	17679	18250	18250	they	663	” He left his diary on the table , where it would be handy in case any new “
17681	17826	18250	18250	they	663	” should wake him up in the night , then he went to bed and presently fell asleep . An hour or two passed , and then he came slowly to consciousness with a confusion of mysterious and augmenting sounds hammering at the gates of his brain for admission ; the next moment he was sharply awake , and those sounds burst with the rush and roar and boom of an undammed freshet into his ears . Banging and slamming of shutters ; smashing of windows and the ringing clash of falling glass ; clatter of flying feet along the halls ; shrieks , supplications , dumb moanings of despair , within , hoarse shouts of command outside ; cracklings and snappings , and the windy roar of victorious flames ! Bang , bang , bang ! on the door , and a cry : “
17836	18243	18250	18250	they	663	” The cry passed on , and the banging . Lord Berkeley sprang out of bed and moved with all possible speed toward the clothes - press in the darkness and the gathering smoke , but fell over a chair and lost his bearings . He groped desperately about on his hands , and presently struck his head against the table and was deeply grateful , for it gave him his bearings again , since it stood close by the door . He seized his most precious possession ; his journaled Impressions of America , and darted from the room . p074.jpg ( 34 K ) He ran down the deserted hall toward the red lamp which he knew indicated the place of a fire - escape . The door of the room beside it was open . In the room the gas was burning full head ; on a chair was a pile of clothing . He ran to the window , could not get it up , but smashed it with a chair , and stepped out on the landing of the fire - escape ; below him was a crowd of men , with a sprinkling of women and youth , massed in a ruddy light . Must he go down in his spectral night dress ? No — this side of the house was not yet on fire except at the further end ; he would snatch on those clothes . Which he did . They fitted well enough , though a trifle loosely , and they were just a shade loud as to pattern . Also as to hat — which was of a new breed to him , Buffalo Bill not having been to England yet . One side of the coat went on , but the other side refused ; one of its sleeves was turned up and stitched to the shoulder . He started down without waiting to get it loose , made the trip successfully , and was promptly hustled outside the limit - rope by the police . The cowboy hat and the coat but half on made him too much of a centre of attraction for comfort , although nothing could be more profoundly respectful , not to say deferential , than was the manner of the crowd toward him . In his mind he framed a discouraged remark for early entry in his diary : “
18272	18309	18335	18335	Cowboy	665	” Presently one of the gaping and adoring half - circle of boys ventured a timid question . My lord answered it . The boys glanced wonderingly at each other and from somewhere fell the comment : “
18323	18334	18340	18341	a cowboy	666	” Another mental note to be preserved for the diary : “
18346	18687	18733	18733	men	669	” But the viscount perceived that some more questions were about to be asked ; so he worked his way out of the crowd , released the sleeve , put on the coat and wandered away to seek a humble and obscure lodging . He found it and went to bed and was soon asleep . In the morning , he examined his clothes . They were rather assertive , it seemed to him , but they were new and clean , at any rate . There was considerable property in the pockets . Item , five one - hundred dollar bills . Item , near fifty dollars in small bills and silver . Plug of tobacco . Hymn - book , which refuses to open ; found to contain whiskey . Memorandum book bearing no name . Scattering entries in it , recording in a sprawling , ignorant hand , appointments , bets , horse - trades , and so on , with people of strange , hyphenated name — Six - Fingered Jake , Young - Man - afraid - of - his - Shadow , and the like . No letters , no documents . The young man muses — maps out his course . His letter of credit is burned ; he will borrow the small bills and the silver in these pockets , apply part of it to advertising for the owner , and use the rest for sustenance while he seeks work . He sends out for the morning paper , next , and proceeds to read about the fire . The biggest line in the display - head announces his own death ! The body of the account furnishes all the particulars ; and tells how , with the inherited heroism of his caste , he went on saving women and children until escape for himself was impossible ; then with the eyes of weeping multitudes upon him , he stood with folded arms and sternly awaited the approach of the devouring fiend ; “
18735	18760	18946	18946	Hawkins	114	” The thing was so fine and generous and knightly that it brought the moisture to his eyes . Presently he said to himself : “
18936	18940	18946	18946	Hawkins	114	” CHAPTER VIII . “
18948	18961	18946	18946	Hawkins	114	” The morning paper dropped from the Colonel ’s nerveless - grasp . “
18966	18967	18946	18946	Hawkins	114	” “
18996	18997	18946	18946	Hawkins	114	” “
19000	19001	18946	18946	Hawkins	114	” “
19023	19024	18946	18946	Hawkins	114	” “
19027	19028	18946	18946	Hawkins	114	” “
19036	19037	18946	18946	Hawkins	114	” “
19040	19041	18946	18946	Hawkins	114	” “
19045	19046	18946	18946	Hawkins	114	” “
19049	19050	19070	19070	You	114	” “
19068	19069	19070	19070	You	114	” “
19075	19076	19070	19070	You	114	” “
19081	19082	19088	19090	The New Gadsby	58	” “
19086	19087	19088	19090	The New Gadsby	58	” “
19092	19093	19109	19111	Both _ who	685	” “
19107	19108	19109	19111	Both _ who	685	” “
19114	19115	19119	19119	Pete	143	” “
19121	19122	19136	19136	I	0	” “
19140	19141	19254	19255	Poor fellow	687	” “
19178	19253	19254	19255	Poor fellow	687	” They searched the paper diligently , and were appalled to find that a one - armed man had been seen flying along one of the halls of the hotel in his underclothing and apparently out of his head with fright , and as he would listen to no one and persisted in making for a stairway which would carry him to certain death , his case was given over as a hopeless one . “
19257	19261	19280	19280	we	683	” sighed Hawkins ; “
19286	19295	19308	19308	We	683	” The earl looked up and said calmly : “
19317	19318	19326	19326	I	0	” “
19324	19325	19326	19326	I	0	” “
19331	19332	19348	19348	you	0	” “
19352	19353	19369	19369	I	0	” “
19372	19373	19394	19394	you	0	” “
19414	19415	19458	19461	This poor young nobleman	691	” “
19463	19464	19500	19500	I	0	” “
19498	19499	19803	19803	his	95	” “
19643	19660	19803	19803	his	95	“ There spoke the real Sellers — the other had a false ring , old friend . ”
19661	19693	19803	19803	his	95	“ Hawkins , my boy , it just occurs to me — a thing I keep forgetting to mention — a matter that we ’ve got to be mighty careful about . ”
19694	19699	19803	19803	his	95	“ What is that ? ”
19700	19757	19789	19789	Sellers	95	“ We must keep absolutely still about these materializations . Mind , not a hint of them must escape — not a hint . To say nothing of how my wife and daughter — high - strung , sensitive organizations — might feel about them , the negroes would n’t stay on the place a minute . ”
19758	19788	20320	20321	the earl	537	“ That ’s true , they would n’t . It ’s well you spoke , for I ’m not naturally discreet with my tongue when I ’m not warned . ”
19932	20050	20320	20321	the earl	537	“ Nothing would do Graham Bell but I must try it ; said the mere _ fact _ of my trying it would secure public confidence , and get it a chance to show what it could do . I _ told _ him that in theory a dry battery was just a curled darling and no mistake , but when it come to _ practice _ , sho!—and here ’s the result . Was I right ? What should _ you _ say , Washington Hawkins ? You ’ve seen me try that button twice . Was I right?—that ’s the idea . Did I know what I was talking about , or did n’t I ? ”
20051	20112	20320	20321	the earl	537	“ Well , you know how I feel about you , Colonel Sellers , and always have felt . It seems to me that you always know everything about _ every_thing . If that man had known you as I know you he would have taken your judgment at the start , and dropped his dry battery where it was . ”
20113	20121	20320	20321	the earl	537	“ Did you ring , Marse Sellers ? ”
20122	20130	20320	20321	the earl	537	“ No , Marse Sellers did n’t . ”
20131	20146	20320	20321	the earl	537	“ Den it was you , Marse Washington . I ’s heah , suh . ”
20147	20158	20320	20321	the earl	537	“ No , it was n’t Marse Washington , either . ”
20159	20172	20320	20321	the earl	537	“ De good lan ’ ! who did ring her , den ? ”
20173	20179	20185	20185	his	700	“ Lord Rossmore rang it ! ”
20190	20214	20215	20215	Jinny	125	“ Blame my skin if I hain’t gone en forgit dat name agin ! Come heah , Jinny — run heah , honey . ”
20218	20245	20320	20321	the earl	537	“ You take dish - yer order de lord gwine to give you I ’s gwine down suller and study dat name tell I git it . ”
20246	20269	20320	20321	the earl	537	“ I take de order ! Who ’s yo ’ nigger las ’ year ? De bell rung for _ you _ . ”
20270	20292	20320	20321	the earl	537	“ Dat do n’t make no diffunce . When a bell ring for anybody , en old marster tell me to — ”
20293	20304	20320	20321	the earl	537	“ Clear out , and settle it in the kitchen ! ”
20324	20346	20320	20321	the earl	537	“ That ’s a trouble with old house servants that were your slaves once and have been your personal friends always . ”
20347	20356	20320	20321	the earl	537	“ Yes , and members of the family . ”
20357	20431	20320	20321	the earl	537	“ Members of the family is just what they become—_the _ members of the family , in fact . And sometimes master and mistress of the household . These two are mighty good and loving and faithful and honest , but hang it , they do just about as they please , they chip into a conversation whenever they want to , and the plain fact is , they ought to be killed . ”
20454	20474	20501	20502	the earl	537	“ What I wanted , Hawkins , was to send for the family and break the news to them . ”
20475	20495	20511	20511	he	537	“ O , never mind bothering with the servants , then . I will go and bring them down . ”
20507	20510	20511	20511	he	537	“ Yes , ”
20516	20618	20935	20936	the wife	715	“ when I ’ve got the materializing down to a certainty , I will get Hawkins to kill them , and after that they will be under better control . Without doubt a materialized negro could easily be hypnotized into a state resembling silence . And this could be made permanent — yes , and also modifiable , at will — sometimes _ very _ silent , sometimes turn on more talk , more action , more emotion , according to what you want . It ’s a prime good idea . Make it adjustable — with a screw or something . ”
20924	20933	20935	20936	the wife	715	“ Have they found the body , Rossmore ? ”
20938	20963	21054	21054	Gwendolen	144	“ Yes , that is , they ’ve found several . It must be one of them , but none of them are recognizable . ”
20964	20972	21054	21054	Gwendolen	144	“ What are you going to do ? ”
20973	20993	20935	20936	the wife	715	“ I am going down there and identify one of them and send it home to the stricken father . ”
20994	21006	21054	21054	Gwendolen	144	“ But papa , did you ever see the young man ? ”
21007	21014	21054	21054	Gwendolen	144	“ No , Gwendolen - why ? ”
21015	21022	20935	20936	the wife	715	“ How will you identify it ? ”
21023	21053	21098	21098	she	144	“ I — well , you know it says none of them are recognizable . I ’ll send his father one of them — there ’s probably no choice . ”
21110	21119	21098	21098	she	144	“ A basket , papa ? What for ? ”
21120	21126	21133	21133	Washington	114	“ It might be ashes . ”
21145	21152	21098	21098	she	144	“ And as _ usual ! _ ”
21153	21158	21098	21098	she	144	“ What , Colonel ? ”
21159	21177	21133	21133	Washington	114	“ Seven of them in that hotel . Actresses . And all burnt out , of course . ”
21178	21187	21098	21098	she	144	“ Any of them burnt _ up ? _ ”
21188	21218	21098	21098	she	144	“ Oh , no they escaped ; they always do ; but there ’s never a one of them that knows enough to fetch out her jewelry with her . ”
21219	21224	21133	21133	Washington	114	“ That ’s strange . ”
21225	21312	21098	21098	she	144	“ Strange — it ’s the most unaccountable thing in the world . Experience teaches them nothing ; they ca n’t seem to learn anything except out of a book . In some cases there ’s manifestly a fatality about it . For instance , take What’s - her - name , that plays those sensational thunder and lightning parts . She ’s got a perfectly immense reputation — draws like a dog - fight — and it all came from getting burnt out in hotels . ”
21313	21327	21098	21098	she	144	“ Why , how could that give her a reputation as an actress ? ”
21328	21393	21133	21133	Washington	114	“ It didn’t — it only made her name familiar . People want to see her play because her name is familiar , but they do n’t know what made it familiar , because they do n’t remember . First , she was at the bottom of the ladder , and absolutely obscure — wages thirteen dollars a week and find her own pads . ”
21394	21397	21098	21098	she	144	“ Pads ? ”
21398	21433	21098	21098	she	144	“ Yes — things to fat up her spindles with so as to be plump and attractive . Well , she got burnt out in a hotel and lost $ 30,000 worth of diamonds . ”
21434	21443	21133	21133	Washington	114	“ She ? Where ’d she get them ? ”
21444	21512	21098	21098	she	144	“ Goodness knows — given to her , no doubt , by spoony young flats and sappy old bald - heads in the front row . All the papers were full of it . She struck for higher pay and got it . Well , she got burnt out again and lost all her diamonds , and it gave her such a lift that she went starring . ”
21513	21546	21098	21098	she	144	“ Well , if hotel fires are all she ’s got to depend on to keep up her name , it ’s a pretty precarious kind of a reputation I should think . ”
21547	21614	21098	21098	she	144	“ Not with her . No , anything but that . Because she ’s so lucky ; born lucky , I reckon . Every time there ’s a hotel fire she ’s in it . She ’s always there — and if she ca n’t be there herself , her diamonds are . Now you ca n’t make anything out of that but just sheer luck . ”
21615	21632	21098	21098	she	144	“ I never heard of such a thing . She must have lost quarts of diamonds . ”
21633	21706	21098	21098	she	144	“ Quarts , she ’s lost bushels of them . It ’s got so that the hotels are superstitious about her . They wo n’t let her in . They think there will be a fire ; and besides , if she ’s there it cancels the insurance . She ’s been waning a little lately , but this fire will set her up . She lost $ 60,000 worth last night . ”
21707	21732	21098	21098	she	144	“ I think she ’s a fool . If I had $ 60,000 worth of diamonds I would n’t trust them in a hotel . ”
21733	21801	21832	21832	He	720	“ I would n’t either ; but you ca n’t teach an actress that . This one ’s been burnt out thirty - five times . And yet if there ’s a hotel fire in San Francisco to - night she ’s got to bleed again , you mark my words . Perfect ass ; they say she ’s got diamonds in every hotel in the country . ”
21835	21871	21832	21832	He	720	“ It is too true , Hawkins — recognition is impossible , not one of the five could be identified by its nearest friend . You make the selection , I ca n’t bear it . ”
21872	21879	21897	21898	the officers	722	“ Which one had I better — ”
21880	21894	22023	22025	The old Colonel	731	“ Oh , take any of them . Pick out the best one . ”
22035	22071	22120	22121	the colonel	374	“ As it turns out there was something prophetic in my fears . Yes , it ’s a matter of ashes . Will you kindly step to a grocery and fetch a couple more baskets ? ”
22112	22115	22218	22218	She	145	“ lie in state,”—a
22226	22253	22259	22259	she	145	“ Well , what will you do next ? What in the world possessed you to clutter up the parlor table with these baskets of ashes ? ”
22254	22257	22264	22264	She	145	“ Ashes ? ”
22273	22284	22218	22218	She	145	“ Well , I _ never _ see de like ! ”
22285	22292	22264	22264	She	145	“ Did n’t you do it ? ”
22293	22329	22342	22342	he	116	“ Who , me ? Clah to goodness it ’s de fust time I ’ve sot eyes on ’em , Miss Polly . Dat ’s Dan’l . Dat ole moke is losin ’ his mine . ”
22350	22381	22264	22264	She	145	“ Dey ai n’t no way to ’ splain dat . Wen hit ’s one er dese - yer common ’ currences , a body kin reckon maybe de cat — ”
22382	22385	22390	22391	Lady Rossmore	145	“ Oh ! ”
22396	22412	22342	22342	he	116	“ I see it all . Keep away from them — they’re _ his _ . ”
22413	22422	22438	22438	She	145	“ _ His _ , m ’ lady ? ”
22423	22437	22480	22480	she	145	“ Yes — your young Marse Sellers from England that ’s burnt up . ”
22475	22478	22480	22480	she	145	“ for , ”
22482	22511	22551	22551	she	145	“ when his sentimentals are up , he ’s a numskull , and there ’s no knowing what extravagance he ’ll contrive , if you let him alone . ”
22537	22550	22556	22556	She	145	“ lie in state , and invite the government and the public , ”
22559	22751	22849	22849	He	742	“ Your intentions are all right — they always are — you want to do honour to the remains , and surely nobody can find any fault with that , for he was your kin ; but you are going the wrong way about it , and you will see it yourself if you stop and think . You ca n’t file around a basket of ashes trying to look sorry for it and make a sight that is really solemn , because the solemner it is , the more it isn’t — anybody can see that . It would be so with one basket ; it would be three times so with three . Well , it stands to reason that if it would n’t be solemn with one mourner , it would n’t be with a procession — and there would be five thousand people here . I do n’t know but it would be pretty near ridiculous ; I think it would . No , Mulberry , they ca n’t lie in state — it would be a mistake . Give that up and think of something else . ”
22871	22918	22849	22849	He	742	“ There — he is as comfortable , now , as we can make him in the circumstances . Except — yes , we must strain a point there — one must do as one would wish to be done by — he must have it . ”
22919	22925	22849	22849	He	742	“ Have what , dear ? ”
22926	22929	22974	22974	She	715	“ Hatchment . ”
22979	23003	22974	22974	She	715	“ But I thought such an honour as that was n’t allowed to any but very _ very _ near relations , who — ”
23004	23046	23165	23165	She	715	“ Right , you are quite right , my lady , perfectly right ; but there are n’t any nearer relatives than relatives by usurpation . We can not avoid it ; we are slaves of aristocratic custom and must submit . ”
23168	23177	23165	23165	She	715	“ Would you send all of the baskets ? ”
23178	23185	23165	23165	She	715	“ Oh , yes , all . ”
23186	23191	23165	23165	She	715	“ All at once ? ”
23192	23224	23165	23165	She	715	“ To his father ? Oh , no — by no means . Think of the shock . No — one at a time ; break it to him by degrees . ”
23225	23236	23165	23165	She	715	“ Would _ that _ have that effect , father ? ”
23237	23318	23165	23165	She	715	“ Yes , my daughter . Remember , you are young and elastic , but he is old . To send him the whole at once might well be more than he could bear . But mitigated — one basket at a time , with restful intervals between , he would be used to it by the time he got all of him . And sending him in three ships is safer anyway . On account of wrecks and storms . ”
23319	23348	23357	23357	Hawkins	114	“ I do n’t like the idea , father . If I were his father it would be dreadful to have him coming in that — in that — ”
23349	23355	23357	23357	Hawkins	114	“ On the installment plan , ”
23369	23412	23423	23424	the earl	537	“ Yes — dreadful to have him coming in that incoherent way . There would be the strain of suspense upon me all the time . To have so depressing a thing as a funeral impending , delayed , waiting , unaccomplished — ”
23413	23421	23423	23424	the earl	537	“ Oh , no , my child , ”
23427	23457	23458	23459	Lady Rossmore	145	“ there would be nothing of that kind ; so old a gentleman could not endure a long - drawn suspense like that . There will be three funerals . ”
23467	23506	23517	23517	Hawkins	114	“ How is _ that _ going to make it easier for him ? It ’s a total mistake , to my mind . He ought to be buried all at once ; I ’m sure of it . ”
23507	23515	23529	23530	the daughter	759	“ I should think so , too , ”
23519	23527	23540	23541	the earl	537	“ And certainly _ I _ should , ”
23532	23538	23540	23541	the earl	537	“ You are all wrong , ”
23543	23565	23574	23575	Lady Rossmore	145	“ You will see it yourselves , if you think . Only one of these baskets has got him in it . ”
23566	23572	23574	23575	Lady Rossmore	145	“ Very well , then , ”
23577	23590	23596	23597	Lady Gwendolen	144	“ the thing is perfectly simple — bury _ that _ one . ”
23591	23594	23610	23611	the earl	537	“ Certainly , ”
23599	23608	23610	23611	the earl	537	“ But it is _ not _ simple , ”
23613	23669	23683	23684	the daughter	759	“ because we do not know which basket he is in . We know he is in _ one _ of them , but that is all we _ do _ know . You see now , I reckon , that I was right ; it takes three funerals , there is no other way . ”
23670	23681	23683	23684	the daughter	759	“ And three graves and three monuments and three inscriptions ? ”
23686	23703	23748	23749	The earl	537	“ Well — yes — to do it right . That is what I should do . ”
23704	23747	23760	23760	he	537	“ It could not be done so , father . Each of the inscriptions would give the same name and the same facts and say he was under each and all of these monuments , and that would not answer at all . ”
23756	23759	23760	23760	he	537	“ No , ”
23763	23783	23794	23794	Hawkins	114	“ that _ is _ an objection . That is a serious objection . I see no way out . ”
23797	23811	23832	23832	he	537	“ It seems to me that if we mixed the three ramifications together — ”
23824	23831	23832	23832	he	537	“ It solves the whole problem , ”
23835	23895	23901	23902	the wife	715	“ One ship , one funeral , one grave , one monument — it is admirably conceived . It does you honor , Major Hawkins , it has relieved me of a most painful embarrassment and distress , and it will save that poor stricken old father much suffering . Yes , he shall go over in one basket . ”
23896	23899	23901	23902	the wife	715	“ When ? ”
23904	23914	23832	23832	he	537	“ To - morrow - immediately , of course . ”
23915	23922	23832	23832	he	537	“ I would wait , Mulberry . ”
23923	23928	23901	23902	the wife	715	“ Wait ? Why ? ”
23929	23945	23832	23832	he	537	“ _ You _ do n’t want to break that childless old man ’s heart . ”
23946	23953	23832	23832	he	537	“ God knows I do n’t ! ”
23954	24007	23901	23902	the wife	715	“ Then wait till he sends for his son ’s remains . If you do that , you will never have to give him the last and sharpest pain a parent can know — I mean , the _ certainty _ that his son is dead . For he will never send . ”
24008	24014	23832	23832	he	537	“ Why wo n’t he ? ”
24015	24064	23832	23832	he	537	“ Because to send — and find out the truth — would rob him of the one precious thing left him , the _ uncertainty _ , the dim hope that maybe , after all , his boy escaped , and he will see him again some day . ”
24065	24083	23901	23902	the wife	715	“ Why Polly , he ’ll know by the _ papers _ that he was burnt up . ”
24084	24151	23832	23832	he	537	“ He wo n’t let himself _ believe _ the papers ; he ’ll argue against anything and everything that proves his son is dead ; and he will keep that up and live on it , and on nothing else till he dies . But if the _ remains _ should actually come , and be put before that poor old dim - hoping soul — ”
24152	24203	24365	24365	He	166	“ Oh , my God , they never shall ! Polly , you ’ve saved me from a crime , and I ’ll bless you for it always . _ Now _ we know what to do . We ’ll place them reverently away , and he shall never know . ”
24360	24364	24380	24380	He	166	“ What name ? ”
24391	24395	24400	24401	the clerks	770	“ Howard Tracy . ”
24407	24412	24492	24492	he	166	“ The cowboy blushed . ”
24506	24557	24559	24559	he	166	“ No help for me now , for henceforth I could n’t draw that money without identification , and that is become legally impossible . No resources to fall back on . It is work or starve from now to the end . I am ready — and not afraid ! ”
24567	24581	24630	24630	He	166	“ Escaped unhurt from burning hotel . Have taken fictitious name . Goodbye . ”

24748	24822	24824	24824	Goethe	183	“ The essayist for this evening is an old member of our club whom you all know , Mr. Parker , assistant editor of the Daily Democrat . The subject of his essay is the American Press , and he will use as his text a couple of paragraphs taken from Mr. Matthew Arnold ’s new book . He asks me to read these texts for him . The first is as follows : “
24828	24834	24824	24824	Goethe	183	“ the thrill of awe , ”
24849	24850	24851	24852	Mr. Arnold	182	” “
24860	24898	25050	25050	he	790	“ ‘ I should say that if one were searching for the best means to efface and kill in a whole nation the discipline of respect , one could not do better than take the American newspapers . ”
24986	25011	25050	25050	he	790	“ in love with _ their _ country and _ its _ institutions , and shielded from the allurements of alien and inimical systems . ”

25848	26167	26183	26184	The chairman	784	“ I ’m glad I came to this country . I was right . I was right to seek out a land where such healthy principles and theories are in men ’s hearts and minds . Think of the innumerable slaveries imposed by misplaced reverence ! How well he brought that out , and how true it is . There ’s manifestly prodigious force in reverence . If you can get a man to reverence your ideals , he ’s your slave . Oh , yes , in all the ages the peoples of Europe have been diligently taught to avoid reasoning about the shams of monarchy and nobility , been taught to avoid examining them , been taught to reverence them ; and now , as a natural result , to reverence them is second nature . In order to shock them it is sufficient to inject a thought of the opposite kind into their dull minds . For ages , any expression of so - called irreverence from their lips has been sin and crime . The sham and swindle of all this is apparent the moment one reflects that he is himself the only legitimately qualified judge of what is entitled to reverence and what is not . Come , I had n’t thought of that before , but it is true , absolutely true . What right has Goethe , what right has Arnold , what right has any dictionary , to define the word Irreverence for me ? What their ideals are is nothing to me . So long as I reverence my own ideals my whole duty is done , and I commit no profanation if I laugh at theirs . I may scoff at other people ’s ideals as much as I want to . It is my right and my privilege . No man has any right to deny it . ”
26192	26274	27215	27215	Tracy	179	“ I would say , for the information of the strangers present here , that in accordance with our custom the subject of this meeting will be debated at the next meeting of the club . This is in order to enable our members to prepare what they may wish to say upon the subject with pen and paper , for we are mainly mechanics and unaccustomed to speaking . We are obliged to write down what we desire to say . ”
27207	27213	27215	27215	Tracy	179	“ How grand that is ! ”
27222	27334	27343	27343	he	179	“ What a civilization it is , and what prodigious results these are ! and brought about almost wholly by common men ; not by Oxford - trained aristocrats , but men who stand shoulder to shoulder in the humble ranks of life and earn the bread that they eat . Again , I ’m glad I came . I have found a country at last where one may start fair , and breast to breast with his fellow man , rise by his own efforts , and be something in the world and be proud of that something ; not be something created by an ancestor three hundred years ago . ”
27360	27367	27677	27677	his	179	“ work and bread for all . ”
27691	27769	27778	27778	he	179	“ I myself did not doubt my stamina before , nobody could doubt it now , if they could see how I am housed , and realise that I feel absolutely no disgust with these quarters , but am as serenely content with them as any dog would be in a similar kennel . Terms , twenty - five dollars a week . I said I would start at the bottom . I have kept my word . ”
27781	27819	27979	27979	she	186	“ What have I been thinking of ! _ This _ the bottom ! Mooning along a whole week , and these terrific expenses climbing and climbing all the time ! I must end this folly straightway . ”
27982	28123	27979	27979	she	186	“ And they ’re a very nice set of boys . They carry on a good deal , but that ’s their fun . You see , this room opens right into this back one , and sometimes they ’re all in one and sometimes in the other ; and hot nights they all sleep on the roof when it do n’t rain . They get out there the minute it ’s hot enough . The season ’s so early that they ’ve already had a night or two up there . If you ’d like to go up and pick out a place , you can . You ’ll find chalk in the side of the chimney where there ’s a brick wanting . You just take the chalk and — but of course you ’ve done it before . ”
28124	28133	27979	27979	she	186	“ Oh , no , I have n’t . ”
28134	28418	27979	27979	she	186	“ Why , of course you haven’t — what am I thinking of ? Plenty of room on the Plains without chalking , I ’ll be bound . Well , you just chalk out a place the size of a blanket anywhere on the tin that ai n’t already marked off , you know , and that ’s your property . You and your bed - mate take turnabout carrying up the blanket and pillows and fetching them down again ; or one carries them up and the other fetches them down , you fix it the way you like , you know . You ’ll like the boys , they ’re everlasting sociable — except the printer . He ’s the one that sleeps in that single bed — the strangest creature ; why , I do n’t believe you could get that man to sleep with another man , not if the house was afire . Mind you , I ’m not just talking , I know . The boys tried him , to see . They took his bed out one night , and so when he got home about three in the morning — he was on a morning paper then , but he ’s on an evening one now — there was n’t any place for him but with the iron - moulder ; and if you ’ll believe me , he just set up the rest of the night — he did , honest . They say he ’s cracked , but it ai n’t so , he ’s English — they’re awful particular . You wo n’t mind my saying that . You — you’re English ? ”
28419	28422	27979	27979	she	186	“ Yes . ”
28423	28649	27979	27979	she	186	“ I thought so . I could tell it by the way you mispronounce the words that ’s got a ’s in them , you know ; such as saying loff when you mean laff — but you ’ll get over that . He ’s a right down good fellow , and a little sociable with the photographer ’s boy and the caulker and the blacksmith that work in the navy yard , but not so much with the others . The fact is , though it ’s private , and the others do n’t know it , he ’s a kind of an aristocrat , his father being a doctor , and _ you _ know what style _ that _ is — in England , I mean , because in this country a doctor ai n’t so _ very _ much , even if he ’s _ that _ . But over there of course it ’s different . So this chap had a falling out with his father , and was pretty high strung , and just cut for this country , and the first he knew he had to get to work or starve . Well , he ’d been to college , you see , and so he judged _ he _ was all right — did you say anything ? ”
28650	28657	27979	27979	she	186	“ No — I only sighed . ”
28658	28761	27979	27979	she	186	“ And there ’s where he was mistaken . Why , he mighty near starved . And I reckon he would have starved sure enough , if some jour ’ printer or other had n’t took pity on him and got him a place as apprentice . So he learnt the trade , and then he was all right — but it was a close call . Once he thought he had _ got _ to haul in his pride and holler for his father and — why , you ’re sighing again . Is anything the matter with you?—does my clatter — ”
28762	28776	27979	27979	she	186	“ Oh , _ dear_—no . Pray go on — I like it . ”
28777	28871	27979	27979	she	186	“ Yes , you see , he ’s been over here ten years ; he ’s twenty - eight , now , and he ai n’t pretty well satisfied in his mind , because he ca n’t get reconciled to being a mechanic and associating with mechanics , he being , as he says to me , a _ gentleman _ , which is a pretty plain letting - on that the boys ai n’t , but of course I know enough not to let _ that _ cat out of the bag . ”
28872	28883	27979	27979	she	186	“ Why — would there be any harm in it ? ”
28884	28954	28992	28993	the mother	2008	“ Harm in it ? They ’d lick him , would n’t they ? Would n’t _ you ? _ Of course you would . Do n’t you ever let a man say you ai n’t a gentleman in _ this _ country . But laws , what am I thinking about ? I reckon a body would think twice before he said a cowboy was n’t a gentleman . ”

29263	29296	29353	29353	she	944	“ Well , I must be going — it ’s getting towards supper time . Make yourself at home , Mr. Tracy , you ’ll hear the bell when it ’s ready . ”
29356	29362	29353	29353	she	944	“ Where are you going ? ”
29363	29380	29406	29406	She	944	“ Well — nowhere in particular , but as I am only in the way here — ”
29381	29405	29414	29414	He	2128	“ Why , who said you were in the way ? Sit down — I’ll move you when you are in the way . ”
29425	29450	29479	29480	The girl	953	“ What gave you that notion ? Do you reckon I need a whole room just to make up a bed or two in ? ”
29451	29478	29479	29480	The girl	953	“ Well no , it was n’t that , exactly . We are away up here in an empty house , and your mother being gone — ”
29491	29552	29353	29353	she	944	“ Nobody to protect me ? Bless you , I do n’t need it . I ’m not afraid . I might be if I was alone , because I do hate ghosts , and I do n’t deny it . Not that I believe in them , for I do n’t . I ’m only just afraid of them . ”
29553	29569	29414	29414	He	2128	“ How can you be afraid of them if you do n’t believe in them ? ”
29570	29612	29479	29480	The girl	953	“ Oh , _ I _ do n’t know the _ how _ of it — that ’s too many for _ me ; _ I only know it ’s _ so _ . It ’s the same with Maggie Lee . ”
29613	29618	29353	29353	she	944	“ Who is that ? ”
29619	29633	29414	29414	He	2128	“ One of the boarders ; young lady that works in the fact’ry . ”
29634	29641	29479	29480	The girl	953	“ She works in a factory ? ”
29642	29648	29353	29353	she	944	“ Yes . Shoe factory . ”
29649	29663	29353	29353	she	944	“ In a shoe factory ; and you call her a young lady ? ”
29664	29680	29751	29752	The girl	953	“ Why , she ’s only twenty - two ; what should you call her ? ”
29681	29750	29780	29780	She	953	“ I was n’t thinking of her age , I was thinking of the title . The fact is , I came away from England to get away from artificial forms — for artificial forms suit artificial people only — and here you ’ve got them too . I ’m sorry . I hoped you had only men and women ; everybody equal ; no differences in rank . ”
29787	29804	29353	29353	she	944	“ Why , they _ are _ all equal . Where ’s any difference in rank ? ”
29805	29827	29353	29353	she	944	“ If you call a factory girl a young _ lady _ , what do you call the President ’s wife ? ”
29828	29837	29780	29780	She	953	“ Call her an _ old _ one . ”
29838	29848	29780	29780	She	953	“ Oh , you make age the only distinction ? ”
29849	29864	29353	29353	she	944	“ There ai n’t any other to make as far as I can see . ”
29865	29874	29780	29780	She	953	“ Then _ all _ women are ladies ? ”
29875	29885	29780	29780	She	953	“ Certainly they are . All the respectable ones . ”
29886	29934	29780	29780	She	953	“ Well , that puts a better face on it . Certainly there is no harm in a title when it is given to everybody . It is only an offense and a wrong when it is restricted to a favored few . But Miss — er — ”
29935	29938	29353	29353	she	944	“ Hattie . ”
29939	29975	29988	29988	He	957	“ Miss Hattie , be frank ; confess that that title _ is n’t _ accorded by everybody to everybody . The rich American does n’t call her cook a lady — isn’t that so ? ”
29976	29987	30016	30016	he	957	“ Yes , it ’s so . What of it ? ”
30008	30015	30016	30016	he	957	“ What _ of _ it ? ”
30019	30052	29353	29353	she	944	“ Why this : equality is _ not _ conceded here , after all , and the Americans are no better off than the English . In fact there ’s no difference . ”
30053	30097	29353	29353	she	944	“ Now _ what _ an idea . There ’s nothing in a title except what is _ put _ into it — you’ve said that yourself . Suppose the title is _ clean _ , instead of lady . You get that ? ”
30098	30126	29353	29353	she	944	“ I believe so . Instead of speaking of a woman as a _ lady _ , you substitute clean and say she ’s a clean person . ”
30127	30149	29353	29353	she	944	“ That ’s it . In England the swell folks do n’t speak of the working people as gentlemen and ladies ? ”
30150	30155	29353	29353	she	944	“ Oh , no . ”
30156	30171	29353	29353	she	944	“ And the working people do n’t call _ themselves _ gentlemen and ladies ? ”
30172	30176	29353	29353	she	944	“ Certainly not . ”
30177	30297	29353	29353	she	944	“ So if you used the other word there would n’t be any change . The swell people would n’t call anybody but themselves ‘ clean , ’ and those others would drop sort of meekly into their way of talking and _ they _ would n’t call themselves clean . We do n’t do that way here . Everybody calls himself a lady or gentleman , and thinks he _ is _ , and do n’t care what anybody else thinks him , so long as he do n’t say it out loud . You think there ’s no difference . You _ knuckle down _ and we _ do n’t _ . Ai n’t that a difference ? ”
30298	30324	29353	29353	she	944	“ It is a difference I had n’t thought of ; I admit that . Still—_calling _ one ’s self a lady doesn’t — er — ”
30325	30336	30429	30430	The girl	953	“ I would n’t go on if I were you . ”
30437	30484	30504	30504	He	958	“ I ’ll get it for you . You go right ahead and _ give _ it to him , Mr. Barrow . He ’s the new boarder — Mr. Tracy — and I ’d just got to where it was getting too deep for me . ”
30485	30503	30504	30504	He	958	“ Much obliged if you will , Hattie . I was coming to borrow of the boys . ”
30518	30811	31015	31015	He	179	“ I ’ve been listening and got interested ; and as I was saying , I would n’t go on , if I were you . You see where you are coming to , do n’t you ? _ Calling _ yourself a lady does n’t elect you ; that is what you were going to say ; and you saw that if you said it you were going to run right up against another difference that you had n’t thought of : to - wit , Whose _ right _ is it to do the electing ? Over there , twenty thousand people in a million elect themselves gentlemen and ladies , and the nine hundred and eighty thousand _ accept _ that decree and swallow the affront which it puts upon them . Why , if they did n’t accept it , it would n’t _ be _ an election , it would be a dead letter and have no force at all . Over here the twenty thousand would - be exclusives come up to the polls and vote themselves to be ladies and gentlemen . But the thing does n’t stop there . The nine hundred and eighty thousand come and vote themselves to be ladies and gentlemen _ too _ , and that elects the whole nation . Since the whole million vote themselves ladies and gentlemen , there is no question about that election . It _ does _ make absolute equality , and there is no fiction about it ; while over yonder the _ inequality _ , ( by decree of the infinitely feeble , and consent of the infinitely strong , ) is also absolute — as real and absolute as our equality . ”
31019	31171	31304	31304	Tracy	179	“ I hope in all sincerity that what you have said is true , as regards the Americans , for doubts have crept into my mind several times . It seemed that the equality must be ungenuine where the sign - names of castes were still in vogue ; but those sign - names have certainly lost their offence and are wholly neutralized , nullified and harmless if they are the undisputed property of every individual in the nation . I think I realize that caste does not exist and can not exist except by common consent of the masses outside of its limits . I thought caste created itself and perpetuated itself ; but it seems quite true that it only creates itself , and is perpetuated by the people whom it despises , and who can dissolve it at any time by assuming its mere sign - names themselves . ”
31172	31300	31304	31304	Tracy	179	“ It ’s what I think . There is n’t any power on earth that can prevent England ’s thirty millions from electing themselves dukes and duchesses to - morrow and calling themselves so . And within six months all the former dukes and duchesses would have retired from the business . I wish they ’d try that . Royalty itself could n’t survive such a process . A handful of frowners against thirty million laughers in a state of irruption . Why , it ’s Herculaneum against Vesuvius ; it would take another eighteen centuries to find that Herculaneum after the cataclysm . What ’s a Colonel in our South ? He ’s a nobody ; because they ’re all colonels down there . No , Tracy ”
31306	31409	31537	31537	he	191	“ nobody in England would call you a gentleman and you would n’t call yourself one ; and I tell you it ’s a state of things that makes a man put himself into most unbecoming attitudes sometimes — the broad and general recognition and acceptance of caste _ as _ caste does , I mean . Makes him do it unconsciously — being bred in him , you see , and never thought over and reasoned out . You could n’t conceive of the Matterhorn being flattered by the notice of one of your comely little English hills , could you ? ”
31410	31415	31304	31304	Tracy	179	“ Why , no . ”
31416	31517	31590	31590	He	191	“ Well , then , let a man in his right mind try to conceive of Darwin feeling flattered by the notice of a princess . It ’s so grotesque that it — well , it paralyzes the imagination . Yet that Memnon _ was _ flattered by the notice of that statuette ; he _ says _ so — says so himself . The system that can make a god disown his godship and profane it — oh , well , it ’s all wrong , it ’s all wrong and ought to be abolished , I should say . ”
31618	31624	31590	31590	He	191	“ What is your trade ? ”
31625	31653	31590	31590	He	191	“ They — well , they call me a cowboy , but that is a fancy . I ’m not that . I have n’t any trade . ”
31654	31664	31590	31590	He	191	“ What do you work at for your living ? ”
31665	31699	31590	31590	He	191	“ Oh , anything — I mean I _ would _ work at , anything I could get to do , but thus far I have n’t been able to find an occupation . ”
31700	31713	31590	31590	He	191	“ Maybe I can help you ; I ’d like to try . ”
31714	31730	31590	31590	He	191	“ I shall be very glad . I ’ve tried , myself , to weariness . ”
31731	31871	32745	32745	She	990	“ Well , of course where a man has n’t a regular trade he ’s pretty bad off in this world . What you needed , I reckon , was less book learning and more bread - and - butter learning . I do n’t know what your father could have been thinking of . You ought to have had a trade , you ought to have had a trade , by _ all _ means . But never mind about that ; we ’ll stir up _ something _ to do , I guess . And do n’t you get homesick ; that ’s a bad business . We ’ll talk the thing over and look around a little . You ’ll come out all right . Wait for me — I’ll go down to supper with you . ”
32747	32749	32745	32745	She	990	“ Mistered ”
32758	32761	32745	32745	She	990	“ Billy , ”
32762	32765	32771	32771	they	1000	“ Tom , ”
32766	32769	32773	32773	her	990	“ John , ”
32774	32776	32771	32771	they	1000	“ Puss ”
32778	32781	33232	33232	Marsh	186	“ Hattie . ”
33243	33439	33489	33489	Barrow	191	“ Oh , he has n’t , has n’t he ? What a pity that is . I do n’t know how I came to overlook him . Ah , he must pardon me . You must indeed Mr — er — Baxter — Barker , you must pardon me . I — er — my attention was directed to some other matter , I do n’t know what . The thing that grieves me mainly is , that it happens every meal now . But you must try to overlook these little things , Mr. Bunker , these little neglects on my part . They ’re always likely to happen with me in any case , and they are especially likely to happen where a person has — er — well , where a person is , say , about three weeks in arrears for his board . You get my meaning?—you get my idea ? Here is your Irish stew , and — er — it gives me the greatest pleasure to send it to you , and I hope that you will enjoy the charity as much as I enjoy conferring it . ”
33494	33514	33524	33524	Tracy	179	“ The old man ’s been waiting for that . He would n’t have missed that chance for anything . ”
33515	33522	33527	33527	he	179	“ It ’s a brutal business , ”
33543	33688	33737	33737	Barrow	191	“ Well , here in this very house is a republic where all are free and equal , if men are free and equal anywhere in the earth , therefore I have arrived at the place I started to find , and I am a man among men , and on the strictest equality possible to men , no doubt . Yet here on the threshold I find an inequality . There are people at this table who are looked up to for some reason or another , and here is a poor devil of a boy who is looked down upon , treated with indifference , and shamed by humiliations , when he has committed no crime but that common one of being poor . Equality ought to make men noble - minded . In fact I had supposed it did do that . ”
33741	33753	33701	33701	Barrow	191	“ As I understand it , you ’re not a cowboy . ”
33754	33761	33737	33737	Barrow	191	“ No , I ’m not . ”
33762	33790	33791	33791	Tracy	179	“ Well , now if you will not think me too curious , how did you come to mount that hat ? Where ’d you get it ? ”
33806	33837	33701	33701	Barrow	191	“ Well , without going into particulars , I exchanged clothes with a stranger under stress of weather , and I would like to find him and re - exchange . ”
33838	33852	33701	33701	Barrow	191	“ Well , why do n’t you find him ? Where is he ? ”
33853	33893	33902	33902	Barrow	191	“ I do n’t know . I supposed the best way to find him would be to continue to wear his clothes , which are conspicuous enough to attract his attention if I should meet him on the street . ”
33894	33900	33902	33902	Barrow	191	“ Oh , very well , ”
33904	33988	34050	34050	both	1032	“ the rest of the outfit , is well enough , and while it ’s not too conspicuous , it is n’t quite like the clothes that anybody else wears . Suppress the hat . When you meet your man he ’ll recognize the rest of his suit . That ’s a mighty embarrassing hat , you know , in a centre of civilization like this . I do n’t believe an angel could get employment in Washington in a halo like that . ”
34055	34060	34140	34141	the Colonel	374	“ There he is ! ”
34144	34190	34236	34236	He	191	“ When you come to think of it , there ’s no occasion for that at all . Now that I ’ve got him materialized , I can command his motions . I ’ll have him at the house by the time we get there . ”
34239	34249	34236	34236	He	191	“ You ’ve never been to the Rocky Mountains ? ”
34250	34253	34140	34141	the Colonel	374	“ No . ”
34254	34264	34236	34236	He	191	“ You ’ve never been out on the plains ? ”
34265	34268	34236	34236	He	191	“ No . ”
34269	34279	34140	34141	the Colonel	374	“ How long have you been in this country ? ”
34280	34286	34140	34141	the Colonel	374	“ Only a few days . ”
34287	34296	34236	34236	He	191	“ You ’ve never been in America before ? ”
34297	34300	34302	34302	Barrow	191	“ No . ”
34307	34455	34468	34468	Tracy	179	“ Now what odd shapes the notions of romantic people take . Here ’s a young fellow who ’s read in England about cowboys and adventures on the plains . He comes here and buys a cowboy ’s suit . Thinks he can play himself on folks for a cowboy , all inexperienced as he is . Now the minute he ’s caught in this poor little game , he ’s ashamed of it and ready to retire from it . It is that exchange that he has put up as an explanation . It ’s rather thin , too thin altogether . Well , he ’s young , never been anywhere , knows nothing about the world , sentimental , no doubt . Perhaps it was the natural thing for him to do , but it was a most singular choice , curious freak , altogether . ”
34475	34488	34140	34141	the Colonel	374	“ Mr. Barrow , the case of that young fellow troubles me . ”
34489	34495	34302	34302	Barrow	191	“ You mean Nat Brady ? ”
34496	34519	34468	34468	Tracy	179	“ Yes , Brady , or Baxter , or whatever it was . The old landlord called him by several different names . ”
34520	34563	34140	34141	the Colonel	374	“ Oh , yes , he has been very liberal with names for Brady , since Brady fell into arrears for his board . Well , that ’s one of his sarcasms — the old man thinks he ’s great on sarcasm . ”
34564	34581	34302	34302	Barrow	191	“ Well , what is Brady ’s difficulty ? What is Brady — who is he ? ”
34582	34679	34692	34692	Barrow	191	“ Brady is a tinner . He ’s a young journeyman tinner who was getting along all right till he fell sick and lost his job . He was very popular before he lost his job ; everybody in the house liked Brady . The old man was rather especially fond of him , but you know that when a man loses his job and loses his ability to support himself and to pay his way as he goes , it makes a great difference in the way people look at him and feel about him . ”
34680	34691	34737	34737	Tracy	179	“ Is that so ! _ Is _ it so ? ”
34701	34736	34737	34737	Tracy	179	“ Why of course it ’s so . Would n’t you know that , naturally . Do n’t you know that the wounded deer is always attacked and killed by its companions and friends ? ”
34754	34783	34785	34785	he	179	“ In a republic of deer and men where all are free and equal , misfortune is a crime , and the prosperous gore the unfortunate to death . ”
34789	34819	34824	34824	Barrow	191	“ Here in the boarding house , if one would have friends and be popular instead of having the cold shoulder turned upon him , he must be prosperous . ”
34820	34823	34824	34824	Barrow	191	“ Yes , ”
34827	35019	35631	35631	Tracy	179	“ that is so . It ’s their human nature . They do turn against Brady , now that he ’s unfortunate , and they do n’t like him as well as they did before ; but it is n’t because of any lack in Brady — he ’s just as he was before , has the same nature and the same impulses , but they — well , Brady is a thorn in their consciences , you see . They know they ought to help him and they ’re too stingy to do it , and they ’re ashamed of themselves for that , and they ought also to hate themselves on that account , but instead of that they hate Brady because he makes them ashamed of themselves . I say that ’s human nature ; that occurs everywhere ; this boarding house is merely the world in little , it ’s the case all over — they’re all alike . In prosperity we are popular ; popularity comes easy in that case , but when the other thing comes our friends are pretty likely to turn against us . ”
35622	35630	35637	35637	he	179	“ What Union do you belong to ? ”
35647	35681	35696	35696	He	179	“ Very well , then , it ’s impossible to employ you . My men would n’t stay with me if I should employ a ‘ scab , ’ or ‘ rat , ’ ”
35699	35721	35726	35726	Barrow	191	“ Why the thing for me to do , of course , is to _ join _ a trade - union . ”
35722	35725	35726	35726	Barrow	191	“ Yes , ”
35729	35743	35696	35696	He	179	“ that is the thing for you to do — if you can . ”
35744	35755	35762	35762	Barrow	191	“ If I _ can ? _ Is it difficult ? ”
35756	35761	35762	35762	Barrow	191	“ Well , Yes , ”
35765	35792	35859	35859	He	179	“ it ’s sometimes difficult — in fact , very difficult . But you can try , and of course it will be best to try . ”
35864	35930	36111	36111	They	996	“ So there is an aristocracy of position here , and an aristocracy of prosperity , and apparently there is also an aristocracy of the ins as opposed to the outs , and I am with the outs . So the ranks grow daily , here . Plainly there are all kinds of castes here and only one that I belong to , the outcasts . ”
36114	36118	36407	36407	He	179	“ Johnny Bull , ”
36410	36415	36958	36958	Allen	204	“ Good evening gentlemen , ”
36694	36705	36958	36958	Allen	204	“ How many does it take to make a pair ? ”
36706	36730	36958	36958	Allen	204	“ Well , two generally makes a pair , but sometimes there ai n’t stuff enough in them to make a whole pair . ”
36734	36746	36958	36958	Allen	204	“ What were you saying about the English a while ago ? ”
36747	36762	36958	36958	Allen	204	“ Oh , nothing , the English are all right , only — I — ”
36763	36774	36958	36958	Allen	204	“ What was it you _ said _ about them ? ”
36775	36785	36958	36958	Allen	204	“ Oh , I only said they swallow well . ”
36786	36793	36958	36958	Allen	204	“ Swallow better than other people ? ”
36794	36810	36958	36958	Allen	204	“ Oh , yes , the English swallow a good deal better than other people . ”

36830	36842	36958	36958	Allen	204	“ Pretty hard to make ’em fight , ai n’t it ? ”
36843	36853	36958	36958	Allen	204	“ No , taint hard to make ’em fight . ”
36854	36861	36826	36827	Another general	1084	“ Ai n’t it , really ? ”
36862	36872	36826	36827	Another general	1084	“ No , taint hard . It ’s impossible . ”
36876	36888	36958	36958	Allen	204	“ This one ’s kind of spiritless , that ’s certain . ”
36889	36903	36958	36958	Allen	204	“ _ Could n’t _ be the other way — in his case . ”
36904	36907	36826	36827	Another general	1084	“ Why ? ”
36908	36919	36958	36958	Allen	204	“ Do n’t you know the secret of his birth ? ”
36920	36934	36958	36958	Allen	204	“ No ! has _ he _ got a secret of his birth ? ”
36935	36941	36958	36958	Allen	204	“ You bet he has . ”
36942	36947	36958	36958	Allen	204	“ What is it ? ”
36948	36957	36958	36958	Allen	204	“ His father was a wax - figger . ”
36976	36987	36958	36958	Allen	204	“ How are you off for friends , these days ? ”
36988	36993	36958	36958	Allen	204	“ Well enough off . ”
36994	37000	36958	36958	Allen	204	“ Got a good many ? ”
37001	37010	36958	36958	Allen	204	“ Well , as many as I need . ”
37011	37049	36958	36958	Allen	204	“ A friend is valuable , sometimes — as a protector , you know . What do you reckon would happen if I was to snatch your cap off and slap you in the face with it ? ”
37050	37068	36958	36958	Allen	204	“ Please do n’t trouble me , Mr. Allen , I ai n’t doing anything to you . ”
37069	37081	37091	37091	Tracy	179	“ You answer me ! What do you reckon would happen ? ”
37082	37090	37091	37091	Tracy	179	“ Well , I do n’t know . ”
37103	37119	37164	37164	He	179	“ Do n’t trouble the young fellow , I can tell you what would happen . ”
37120	37163	37193	37193	he	179	“ Oh , you can , can you ? Boys , Johnny Bull can tell us what would happen if I was to snatch this chump ’s cap off and slap him in the face with it . Now you ’ll see . ”
37215	37240	37693	37693	he	179	“ A ring , a ring , make a ring ! Fair play all round ! Johnny ’s grit ; give him a chance . ”

37813	37824	37825	37825	she	187	“ I ’m glad you think so , Miss Hattie , ”
37832	37844	38225	38225	he	179	“ Do n’t call me Miss Hattie — call me Puss . ”
38229	38293	38294	38294	He	179	“ If my father knew what my American name is,—he — well , my duty to my father rather _ requires _ that I furnish him my name . I have no right to make his days and nights unhappy , I can do enough unhappiness for the family all by myself . Really he ought to know what my American name is . ”
38311	38319	38375	38375	Tracy	179	“ My American name is Howard Tracy . ”
38380	38452	38375	38375	Tracy	179	“ Ah , but if he should cable me to come home ! I — I — couldn’t do that — I _ must n’t _ do that . I ’ve started out on a mission , and I must n’t turn my back on it in cowardice . No , no , I could n’t go home , at — at — least I should n’t want to go home . ”
38458	38574	38626	38626	He	1131	“ Well , maybe — perhaps — it would be my _ duty _ to go in the circumstances ; he ’s very old and he does need me by him to stay his footsteps down the long hill that inclines westward toward the sunset of his life . Well , I ’ll think about that . Yes , of course it would n’t be right to stay here . If I — well , perhaps I could just drop him a line and put it off a little while and satisfy him in that way . It would be — well , it would mar everything to have him require me to come instantly . ”
38581	38625	38626	38626	He	1131	“ And yet if he should do that I do n’t know but — oh , dear me—_home ! _ how good it sounds ! and a body is excusable for wanting to see his home again , now and then , anyway . ”

38793	38808	38880	38881	The boy	1137	“ Do n’t you think you could wait a minute , if you tried ? ”
38895	38908	38880	38881	The boy	1137	“ The Earl of Rossmore ! Cracky ! Do you know him ? ”
38909	38912	38880	38881	The boy	1137	“ Yes . ”
38913	38923	38880	38881	The boy	1137	“ Is that so ! Does he know you ? ”
38924	38929	38880	38881	The boy	1137	“ Well — yes . ”
38930	38941	38880	38881	The boy	1137	“ Well , I swear ! Will he answer you ? ”
38942	38948	38880	38881	The boy	1137	“ I think he will . ”
38949	38961	38880	38881	The boy	1137	“ Will he though ? Where ’ll you have it sent ? ”
38962	38980	38880	38881	The boy	1137	“ Oh , nowhere . I ’ll call here and get it . When shall I call ? ”
38981	39017	39090	39090	He	179	“ Oh , I do n’t know — I’ll send it to you . Where shall I send it ? Give me your address ; I ’ll send it to you soon ’s it comes . ”
39095	39196	39333	39334	The boy	1137	“ There _ is _ something pleasant about being respected . I have acquired the respect of Mr. Allen and some of those others , and almost the deference of some of them on pure merit , for having thrashed Allen . While their respect and their deference — if it is deference — is pleasant , a deference based upon a sham , a shadow , does really seem pleasanter still . It ’s no real merit to be in correspondence with an earl , and yet after all , that boy makes me feel as if there was . ”
39337	39344	39333	39334	The boy	1137	“ No , no answer yet , ”
39353	39369	39333	39334	The boy	1137	“ I do n’t think it ’s likely you ’ll get one to - day . ”
39370	39374	39333	39334	The boy	1137	“ Why not ? ”
39375	39440	39447	39447	Tracy	179	“ Well , you see it ’s getting pretty late . You ca n’t always tell where ’ bouts a man is when he ’s on the other side , and you ca n’t always find him just the minute you want him , and you see it ’s getting about six o’clock now , and over there it ’s pretty late at night . ”
39441	39445	39447	39447	Tracy	179	“ Why yes , ”
39449	39457	39333	39334	The boy	1137	“ I had n’t thought of that . ”
39458	39486	39626	39626	Barrow	191	“ Yes , pretty late , now , half past ten or eleven . Oh yes , you probably wo n’t get any answer to - night . ”
39629	39642	39683	39683	He	179	“ Come with me . I ’ll give you a jolly evening . ”
39643	39652	39626	39626	Barrow	191	“ Very good . Where are you going ? ”
39653	39658	39626	39626	Barrow	191	“ To my club . ”
39659	39665	39683	39683	He	179	“ What club is that ? ”
39666	39672	39901	39902	the chairman	784	“ Mechanics ’ Debating Club . ”
39918	39923	40085	40085	He	1159	“ The American Press . ”
40088	40175	40392	40392	He	179	“ if there were a lord or the son of a lord here , I would like to reason with him , and try to show him how unfair and how selfish his position is . I would try to persuade him to relinquish it , take his place among men on equal terms , earn the bread he eats , and hold of slight value all deference paid him because of artificial position , all reverence not the just due of his own personal merits . ”
40398	40435	40451	40451	Barrow	191	“ How unanswerable it all is — how absolutely unanswerable ! It is basely , degradingly selfish to keep those unearned honors , and — and — oh , hang it , nobody but a cur — ”
40436	40446	40523	40523	Tracy	179	“ What an idiotic damned speech that Tompkins made ! ”
40509	40522	40574	40574	He	179	“ Come up to my room and smoke a pipe , Tracy . ”
40602	40616	40574	40574	He	179	“ What is it you object to in Tompkins ’s speech , Barrow ? ”
40617	40642	40574	40574	He	179	“ Oh , the leaving out of the factor of human nature ; requiring another man to do what you would n’t do yourself . ”
40643	40648	40574	40574	He	179	“ Do you mean — ”
40649	40721	40574	40574	He	179	“ Why here ’s what I mean ; it ’s very simple . Tompkins is a blacksmith ; has a family ; works for wages ; and hard , too — fooling around wo n’t furnish the bread . Suppose it should turn out that by the death of somebody in England he is suddenly an earl — income , half a million dollars a year . What would he do ? ”
40722	40736	40574	40574	He	179	“ Well , I — I suppose he would have to decline to — ”
40737	40748	40574	40574	He	179	“ Man , he would grab it in a second ! ”
40749	40757	40574	40574	He	179	“ Do you really think he would ? ”
40758	40771	40574	40574	He	179	“ Think?—I do n’t think anything about it , I know it . ”
40772	40775	40574	40574	He	179	“ Why ? ”
40776	40786	40574	40574	He	179	“ Why ? Because he ’s not a fool . ”
40787	40800	40574	40574	He	179	“ So you think that if he were a fool , he — ”
40801	40847	40574	40574	He	179	“ No , I do n’t . Fool or _ no _ fool , he would grab it . Anybody would . Anybody that ’s alive . And I ’ve seen dead people that would get up and go for it . I would myself . ”
40869	40879	40574	40574	He	179	“ But I thought you were opposed to nobilities . ”
40880	40908	40574	40574	He	179	“ Transmissible ones , yes . But that ’s nothing . I ’m opposed to millionaires , but it would be dangerous to offer me the position . ”
40909	40915	40936	40936	Tracy	179	“ You ’d take it ? ”
40916	40935	40936	40936	Tracy	179	“ I would leave the funeral of my dearest enemy to go and assume its burdens and responsibilities . ”
40944	40978	41097	41097	He	191	“ I do n’t know that I quite get the bearings of your position . You say you are opposed to hereditary nobilities , and yet if you had the chance you would — ”
40979	41046	41053	41053	Tracy	179	“ Take one ? In a minute I would . And there is n’t a mechanic in that entire club that would n’t . There is n’t a lawyer , doctor , editor , author , tinker , loafer , railroad president , saint — land , there is n’t a human _ being _ in the United States that would n’t jump at the chance ! ”
41047	41051	41053	41053	Tracy	179	“ Except me , ”
41056	41060	41126	41126	He	191	“ Except you ! ”
41119	41125	41164	41164	he	191	“ Except _ you ! _ ”
41156	41162	41164	41164	he	191	“ Except _ you ! _ ”
41183	41256	41126	41126	He	191	“ He ’s straining his viscera and he ’s breaking his heart trying to get some low - down job that a good dog would n’t have , and yet wants to let on that if he had a chance to scoop an earldom he would n’t do it . Tracy , do n’t put this kind of a strain on me . Lately I ’m not as strong as I was . ”
41257	41291	41164	41164	he	191	“ Well , I was n’t meaning to put — a strain on you , Barrow , I was only meaning to intimate that if an earldom ever does fall in my way — ”
41292	41330	41164	41164	he	191	“ There — I would n’t give myself any worry about _ that _ , if I was you . And besides , I can settle what you would do . Are you any different from me ? ”
41331	41336	41126	41126	He	191	“ Well — no . ”
41337	41345	41164	41164	he	191	“ Are you any better than me ? ”
41346	41354	41164	41164	he	191	“ O,—er — why , certainly not . ”
41355	41365	41126	41126	He	191	“ Are you as _ good ? _ Come ! ”
41366	41380	41164	41164	he	191	“ Indeed , I — the fact is you take me so suddenly — ”
41381	41560	41587	41587	he	179	“ Suddenly ? What is there sudden about it ? It is n’t a difficult question is it ? Or doubtful ? Just measure us on the only fair lines — the lines of merit — and of course you ’ll admit that a journeyman chairmaker that earns his twenty dollars a week , and has had the good and genuine culture of contact with men , and care , and hardship , and failure , and success , and downs and ups and ups and downs , is just a trifle the superior of a young fellow like you , who does n’t know how to do anything that ’s valuable , ca n’t earn his living in any secure and steady way , has n’t had any experience of life and its seriousness , has n’t any culture but the artificial culture of books , which adorns but does n’t really educate — come ! if _ I _ would n’t scorn an earldom , what the devil right have _ you _ to do it ! ”
41594	41657	41164	41164	he	191	“ But look here , I really ca n’t quite get the hang of your notions — your principles , if they are principles . You are inconsistent . You are opposed to aristocracies , yet you ’d take an earldom if you could . Am I to understand that you do n’t blame an earl for being and remaining an earl ? ”
41658	41664	41126	41126	He	191	“ I certainly do n’t . ”
41665	41691	41587	41587	he	179	“ And you would n’t blame Tompkins , or yourself , or me , or anybody , for accepting an earldom if it was offered ? ”
41692	41698	41164	41164	he	191	“ Indeed I would n’t . ”
41699	41711	41126	41126	He	191	“ Well , then , whom _ would _ you blame ? ”
41712	41762	41587	41587	he	179	“ The whole nation — any bulk and mass of population anywhere , in any country , that will put up with the infamy , the outrage , the insult of a hereditary aristocracy which _ they _ ca n’t enter — and on absolutely free and equal terms . ”
41763	41778	41164	41164	he	191	“ Come , are n’t you beclouding yourself with distinctions that are not differences ? ”
41779	41851	41126	41126	He	191	“ Indeed I am not . I am entirely clear - headed about this thing . If I could extirpate an aristocratic system by declining its honors , _ then _ I should be a rascal to accept them . And if enough of the mass would join me to make the extirpation possible , _ then _ I should be a rascal to do otherwise than help in the attempt . ”
41852	41908	41126	41126	He	191	“ I believe I understand — yes , I think I get the idea . You have no blame for the lucky few who naturally decline to vacate the pleasant nest they were born into , you only despise the all - powerful and stupid mass of the nation for allowing the nest to exist . ”
41909	41937	41587	41587	he	179	“ That ’s it , that ’s it ! You _ can _ get a simple thing through your head if you work at it long enough . ”
41938	41941	42010	42010	Tracy	179	“ Thanks . ”
41942	42009	42028	42028	Barrow	191	“ Do n’t mention it . And I ’ll give you some sound advice : when you go back ; if you find your nation up and ready to abolish that hoary affront , lend a hand ; but if that is n’t the state of things and you get a chance at an earldom , do n’t you be a fool — you take it . ”
42017	42027	42089	42089	Tracy	179	“ As I live , I ’ll do it ! ”
42031	42088	42092	42092	Barrow	191	“ I never saw such a fellow . I begin to think you ’ve got a good deal of imagination . With you , the idlest fancy freezes into a reality at a breath . Why , you looked , then , as if it would n’t astonish you if you did tumble into an earldom . ”
42095	42163	42454	42454	he	179	“ Earldom ! Oh , yes , take it , if it offers ; but meantime we ’ll go on looking around , in a modest way , and if you get a chance to superintend a sausage - stuffer at six or eight dollars a week , you just trade off the earldom for a last year ’s almanac and stick to the sausage - stuffing . ”
42465	42471	42454	42454	he	179	“ Is that for me ? ”
42472	42475	42454	42454	he	179	“ Yes . ”
42476	42484	42454	42454	he	179	“ What is the purpose of it ? ”
42485	42496	42454	42454	he	179	“ I want to speak to you — in private . ”
42497	42506	42516	42516	He	179	“ This spot is private enough for me . ”
42521	42541	42557	42557	Tracy	179	“ Oh , in public , then , if you prefer . Though it has n’t been my way . ”
42551	42555	42557	42557	Tracy	179	“ Speak out , ”
42559	42566	42516	42516	He	179	“ What is it you want ? ”
42567	42579	42516	42516	He	179	“ Well , have n’t you — er — forgot something ? ”
42580	42590	42557	42557	Tracy	179	“ I ? I ’m not aware of it . ”
42591	42607	42516	42516	He	179	“ Oh , you ’re not ? Now you stop and think , a minute . ”
42608	42630	42638	42638	Marsh	186	“ I refuse to stop and think . It does n’t interest me . If it interests you , speak out . ”
42631	42636	42641	42641	his	179	“ Well , then , ”
42649	42669	42750	42750	Tracy	179	“ You forgot to pay your board yesterday — if you ’re _ bound _ to have it public . ”
42732	42749	42804	42804	he	179	“ Is _ that _ all ! Take your money and give your terrors a rest . ”
42814	42820	42832	42832	he	179	“ I’ve — been robbed ! ”
42835	42926	42927	42931	One of the negro women	1203	“ Robbed , is it ? _ That ’s _ your tune ? It ’s too old — been played in this house too often ; everybody plays it that ca n’t get work when he wants it , and wo n’t work when he can get it . Trot out Mr. Allen , somebody , and let _ him _ take a toot at it . It ’s _ his _ turn next , _ he _ forgot , too , last night . I ’m laying for him . ”
42947	42957	42832	42832	he	179	“ Misto Marsh , Misto Allen ’s skipped out ! ”
42958	42961	42927	42931	One of the negro women	1203	“ What ! ”
42962	42983	42927	42931	One of the negro women	1203	“ Yes - sah , and cleaned out his room _ clean ; _ tuck bofe towels en de soap ! ”
42984	42991	42832	42832	he	179	“ You lie , you hussy ! ”
42992	43021	43032	43032	He	195	“ It ’s jes ’ so , jes ’ as I tells you — en Misto Summer ’s socks is gone , en Misto Naylor ’s yuther shirt . ”
43037	43049	42927	42931	One of the negro women	1203	“ Answer up now — when are you going to settle ? ”
43050	43064	43098	43098	Tracy	179	“ To - day — since you seem to be in a hurry . ”
43065	43097	43105	43105	He	179	“ _ To - day _ is it ? Sunday — and you out of work ? I like that . Come — where are you going to get the money ? ”
43112	43121	43154	43154	he	195	“ I am expecting a cablegram from home . ”
43165	43253	43263	43264	The crowd	2117	“ A _ cablegram_—think of it , ladies and gents , he ’s expecting a cablegram ! _ He ’s _ expecting a cablegram — this duffer , this scrub , this bilk ! From his father — eh ? Yes — without a doubt . A dollar or two a word — oh , that ’s nothing—_they _ do n’t mind a little thing like that—_this _ kind ’s fathers do n’t . Now his father is — er — well , I reckon his father — ”
43254	43262	43283	43283	they	2117	“ My father is an English earl ! ”
43278	43281	43308	43308	He	179	“ cheek . ”
43311	43319	43330	43330	Marsh	207	“ Stand aside , please . I — ”
43320	43328	43330	43330	Marsh	207	“ Wait a minute , your lordship , ”
43335	43342	43308	43308	He	179	“ where is your lordship going ? ”
43343	43352	43308	43308	He	179	“ For the cablegram . Let me pass . ”
43353	43368	43330	43330	Marsh	207	“ Excuse me , your lordship , you ’ll stay right where you are . ”
43369	43377	43308	43308	He	179	“ What do you mean by that ? ”
43378	43440	43451	43452	Mrs. Marsh	186	“ I mean that I did n’t begin to keep boarding - house yesterday . It means that I am not the kind that can be taken in by every hack - driver ’s son that comes loafing over here because he ca n’t bum a living at home . It means that you ca n’t skip out on any such — ”
43459	43468	43469	43469	She	186	“ Do n’t , Mr. Tracy , please . ”
43477	43516	43308	43308	He	179	“ _ Do _ bridle your tongue . What has he done to be treated so ? Ca n’t you _ see _ he has lost his mind , with trouble and distress ? He ’s not responsible . ”
43517	43548	43558	43558	Marsh	186	“ Thank your kind heart , madam , but I ’ve not lost my mind ; and if I can have the mere privilege of stepping to the telegraph office — ”
43549	43556	43558	43558	Marsh	186	“ Well , you ca n’t , ”
43560	43565	43308	43308	He	179	“ — or sending — ”
43566	43591	43558	43558	Marsh	186	“ Sending ! That beats everything . If there ’s anybody that ’s fool enough to go on such a chuckle - headed errand — ”
43592	43606	43308	43308	He	179	“ Here comes Mr. Barrow — he will go for me . Barrow — ”
43615	43626	43308	43308	He	179	“ Say , Barrow , he ’s expecting a cablegram ! ”
43627	43636	43308	43308	He	179	“ Cablegram from his father , you know ! ”
43637	43647	43308	43308	He	179	“ Yes — cablegram from the wax - figger ! ”
43648	43670	43308	43308	He	179	“ And say , Barrow , this fellow ’s an earl — take off your hat , pull down your vest ! ”
43671	43699	43308	43308	He	179	“ Yes , he ’s come off and forgot his crown , that he wears Sundays . He ’s cabled over to his pappy to send it . ”
43700	43721	43728	43728	Barrow	191	“ You step out and get that cablegram , Barrow ; his majesty ’s a little lame to - day . ”
43722	43726	43738	43738	He	191	“ Oh stop , ”
43730	43737	43738	43738	He	191	“ give the man a chance . ”
43747	43775	43308	43308	He	179	“ Tracy , what ’s the matter with you ? What kind of foolishness is this you ’ve been talking . You ought to have more sense . ”
43776	43794	43308	43308	He	179	“ I ’ve not been talking foolishness ; and if you ’ll go to the telegraph office — ”
43795	43846	43738	43738	He	191	“ Oh ; do n’t talk so . I ’m your friend in trouble and out of it , before your face and behind your back , for anything in _ reason ; _ but you ’ve lost your head , you see , and this moonshine about a cablegram — ”
43847	43859	43898	43898	Brady	198	“ _ I ’ll _ go there and ask for it ! ”
43860	43897	43738	43738	He	191	“ Thank you from the bottom of my heart , Brady . Here , I ’ll give you a Written order for it . Fly , now , and fetch it . We ’ll soon see ! ”
43927	43965	44008	44008	he	191	“ Maybe he _ is _ expecting a cablegram — maybe he _ has _ got a father somewhere — maybe we ’ve been just a little too fresh , just a shade too ‘ previous ’ ! ”
44011	44019	44033	44033	he	191	“ Not yet , Barrow — presently . ”
44036	44046	44056	44056	he	191	“ I would rather wait — till he comes . ”
44062	44065	44326	44330	The humorist of the house	1218	“ brash , ”
44320	44325	44385	44385	he	179	“ _ Thanks _ . ”
44415	44426	44632	44632	Barrow	191	“ Oh , pappy , how _ could _ you ! ”
44635	44664	44725	44725	her	1240	“ Never mind , now — leave him alone . You ’ve no account with him but a money account . I ’ll take care of that myself . ”
44728	44752	44725	44725	her	1240	“ You ’re the only man here , and I ’m going to set my cap for you , you dear old thing ! ”
44753	44772	44856	44856	Barrow	191	“ For shame , Puss ! How you talk ! I _ never _ saw such a child ! ”
44872	44998	44856	44856	Barrow	191	“ _ Now _ , old fellow , take in your battle - flag out of the wet , you ’re not in the hostile camp any more . You ’re a little upset by your troubles , and that ’s natural enough , but do n’t let your mind run on them anymore than you can help ; drag your thoughts away from your troubles by the ears , by the heels , or any other way , so you manage it ; it ’s the healthiest thing a body can do ; dwelling on troubles is deadly , just deadly — and that ’s the softest name there is for it . You must keep your mind amused — you must , indeed . ”
44999	45005	44856	44856	Barrow	191	“ Oh , miserable me ! ”
45006	45050	44856	44856	Barrow	191	“ _ Do n’t ! _ There ’s just pure heart - break in that tone . It ’s just as I say ; you ’ve got to get right down to it and amuse your mind , as if it was salvation . ”
45051	45117	44856	44856	Barrow	191	“ They ’re easy words to say , Barrow , but how am I going to amuse , entertain , divert a mind that finds itself suddenly assaulted and overwhelmed by disasters of a sort not dreamed of and not provided for ? No — no , the bare idea of amusement is repulsive to my feelings : Let us talk of death and funerals . ”
45118	45160	44856	44856	Barrow	191	“ No — not yet . That would be giving up the ship . We ’ll not give up the ship yet . I ’m going to amuse you ; I sent Brady out for the wherewithal before you finished breakfast . ”
45161	45169	44856	44856	Barrow	191	“ You did ? What is it ? ”
45170	45190	45226	45226	Barrow	191	“ Come , this is a good sign — curiosity . Oh , there ’s hope for you yet . ”
45206	45225	45374	45374	Barrow	191	“ They ’re finishing one up , but they ’ll be along as soon as it ’s done . ”
45360	45372	45374	45374	Barrow	191	“ Oh , _ you ’re _ all right , yet , ”
45376	45385	45511	45511	Tracy	179	“ You see you ’re not past amusement . ”
45502	45509	45511	45511	Tracy	179	“ Explain — explain these aberrations , ”
45513	45643	45980	45982	Capt . Saltmarsh	216	“ Well , they are not the achievement of a single intellect , a single talent — it takes two to do these miracles . They are collaborations ; the one artist does the figure , the other the accessories . The figure - artist is a German shoemaker with an untaught passion for art , the other is a simple hearted old Yankee sailor - man whose possibilities are strictly limited to his ship , his cannon and his patch of petrified sea . They work these things up from twenty - five - cent tintypes ; they get six dollars apiece for them , and they can grind out a couple a day when they strike what they call a boost — that is , an inspiration . ”
45644	45653	45948	45949	The artists	2675	“ People actually pay money for these calumnies ? ”
45654	45801	45511	45511	Tracy	179	“ They actually do — and quite willingly , too . And these abortionists could double their trade and work the women in , if Capt . Saltmarsh could whirl a horse in , or a piano , or a guitar , in place of his cannon . The fact is , he fatigues the market with that cannon . Even the male market , I mean . These fourteen in the procession are not all satisfied . One is an old ‘ independent ’ fireman , and he wants an engine in place of the cannon ; another is a mate of a tug , and wants a tug in place of the ship — and so on , and so on . But the captain ca n’t make a tug that is deceptive , and a fire engine is many flights beyond his power . ”
45802	45827	45980	45982	Capt . Saltmarsh	216	“ This _ is _ a most extraordinary form of robbery , I never have heard of anything like it . It ’s interesting . ”
45828	45901	45948	45949	The artists	2675	“ Yes , and so are the artists . They are perfectly honest men , and sincere . And the old sailor - man is full of sound religion , and is as devoted a student of the Bible and misquoter of it as you can find anywhere . I do n’t know a better man or kinder hearted old soul than Saltmarsh , although he does swear a little , sometimes . ”
45902	45917	45511	45511	Tracy	179	“ He seems to be perfect . I want to know him , Barrow . ”
45918	45947	46088	46088	Barrow	191	“ You ’ll have the chance . I guess I hear them coming , now . We ’ll draw them out on their art , if you like . ”
46080	46086	46088	46088	Barrow	191	“ They ’re wonderful pictures , ”
46090	46097	46110	46110	Handel	217	“ We ’ve been examining them . ”
46098	46108	46110	46110	Handel	217	“ It is very bleasant dot you like dem , ”
46118	46135	46088	46088	Barrow	191	“ Und you , Herr Tracy , you haf peen bleased mit dem too , alretty ? ”
46136	46151	46157	46158	the German	1255	“ I can honestly say I have never seen anything just like them before . ”
46152	46155	46157	46158	the German	1255	“ Schön ! ”
46162	46180	46181	46182	The captain	2673	“ You hear , Gaptain ? Here is a chentleman , yes , vot abbreviate unser aart . ”
46189	46220	46088	46088	Barrow	191	“ Well , sir , we ’re thankful for a compliment yet , though they ’re not as scarce now as they used to be before we made a reputation . ”
46221	46237	46088	46088	Barrow	191	“ Getting the reputation is the up - hill time in most things , captain . ”
46238	46301	46316	46316	Tracy	218	“ It ’s so . It ai n’t enough to know how to reef a gasket , you got to make the mate know you know it . That ’s reputation . The good word , said at the right time , that ’s the word that makes us ; and evil be to him that evil thinks , as Isaiah says . ”
46302	46314	46316	46316	Tracy	218	“ It ’s very relevant , and hits the point exactly , ”
46318	46327	46088	46088	Barrow	191	“ Where did you study art , Captain ? ”
46328	46340	46088	46088	Barrow	191	“ I have n’t studied ; it ’s a natural gift . ”
46341	46420	46442	46443	The captain	2673	“ He is born mit dose cannon in him . He tondt haf to do noding , his chenius do all de vork . Of he is asleep , and take a pencil in his hand , out come a cannon . Py crashus , of he could do a clavier , of he could do a guitar , of he could do a vashtub , it is a fortune , heiliger Yohanniss it is yoost a fortune ! ”
46421	46441	46449	46449	himself	2673	“ Well , it is an immense pity that the business is hindered and limited in this unfortunate way . ”
46453	46566	46088	46088	Barrow	191	“ You ’ve said it , Mr. Tracy!—Hindered ? well , I should say so . Why , look here . This fellow here , No . 11 , he ’s a hackman,—a flourishing hackman , I may say . He wants his hack in this picture . Wants it where the cannon is . I got around that difficulty , by telling him the cannon ’s our trademark , so to speak — proves that the picture ’s our work , and I was afraid if we left it out people would n’t know for certain if it _ was _ a Saltmarsh — Handel — now you would n’t yourself — ”
46567	46628	46088	46088	Barrow	191	“ What , Captain ? You wrong yourself , indeed you do . Anyone who has once seen a genuine Saltmarsh - Handel is safe from imposture forever . Strip it , flay it , skin it out of every detail but the bare color and expression , and that man will still recognize it — still stop to worship — ”
46629	46643	46449	46449	himself	2673	“ Oh , how it makes me feel to hear dose oxpressions ! — ”
46645	46690	46088	46088	Barrow	191	“ still say to himself again as he had , said a hundred times before , the art of the Saltmarsh - Handel is an art apart , there is nothing in the heavens above or in the earth beneath that resembles it , — ”
46691	46712	46088	46088	Barrow	191	“ Py chiminy , nur hören Sie einmal ! In my life day haf I never heard so brecious worts . ”
46713	46810	46449	46449	himself	2673	“ So I talked him out of the hack , Mr. Tracy , and he let up on that , and said put in a hearse , then — because he ’s chief mate of a hearse but do n’t own it — stands a watch for wages , you know . But I ca n’t do a hearse any more than I can a hack ; so here we are — becalmed , you see . And it ’s the same with women and such . They come and they want a little johnry picture — ”
46811	46824	46885	46886	the captain	2673	“ It ’s the accessories that make it a _ genre ? _ ”
46825	46883	46885	46886	the captain	2673	“ Yes — cannon , or cat , or any little thing like that , that you heave in to whoop up the effect . We could do a prodigious trade with the women if we could foreground the things they like , but they do n’t give a damn for artillery . Mine ’s the lack , ”
46891	46914	46933	46935	the pleased German	224	“ Andy ’s end of the business is all right I tell you _ he ’s _ an artist from way back ! ”
46915	46931	46933	46935	the pleased German	224	“ Yoost hear dot old man ! He always talk ’ poud me like dot , ”
46937	46957	46449	46449	himself	2673	“ Look at his work yourself ! Fourteen portraits in a row . And no two of them alike . ”
46958	46987	46885	46886	the captain	2673	“ Now that you speak of it , it is true ; I had n’t noticed it before . It is very remarkable . Unique , I suppose . ”
46988	47041	46933	46935	the pleased German	224	“ I should say so . That ’s the very _ thing _ about Andy — he _ discriminates _ . Discrimination ’s the thief of time — forty - ninth Psalm ; but that ai n’t any matter , it ’s the honest thing , and it pays in the end . ”
47042	47083	47103	47103	himself	2673	“ Yes , he certainly is great in that feature , one is obliged to admit it ; but — now mind , I ’m not really criticising — don’t you think he is just a trifle overstrong in technique ? ”
47105	47127	47129	47129	he	2673	“ Technique — technique — polytechnique — pyro - technique ; that ’s it , likely — fireworks too much color . ”
47140	47264	47129	47129	he	2673	“ Well , yes , he does pile it on pretty loud ; but they all like it , you know — fact is , it ’s the life of the business . Take that No . 9 , there , Evans the butcher . He drops into the stoodio as sober - colored as anything you ever see : _ now _ look at him . You ca n’t tell him from scarlet fever . Well , it pleases that butcher to death . I ’m making a study of a sausage - wreath to hang on the cannon , and I do n’t really reckon I can do it right , but if I can , we can break the butcher . ”
47265	47284	47129	47129	he	2673	“ Unquestionably your confederate — I mean your — your fellow - craftsman — is a great colorist — ”
47285	47292	47129	47129	he	2673	“ Oh , danke schön ! — ”
47294	47367	47373	47374	the captain	2673	“ in fact a quite extraordinary colorist ; a colorist , I make bold to say , without imitator here or abroad — and with a most bold and effective touch , a touch like a battering ram ; and a manner so peculiar and romantic , and extraneous , and ad libitum , and heart - searching , that — that — he — he is an impressionist , I presume ? ”
47368	47371	47373	47374	the captain	2673	“ No , ”
47377	47383	47449	47450	The captain	2673	“ he is a Presbyterian . ”
47384	47448	47449	47450	The captain	2673	“ It accounts for it all — all — there ’s something divine about his art,—soulful , unsatisfactory , yearning , dim hearkening on the void horizon , vague — murmuring to the spirit out of ultra - marine distances and far - sounding cataclysms of uncreated space — oh , if he — if , he — has he ever tried distemper ? ”
47456	47470	47129	47129	he	2673	“ Not if he knows himself ! But his dog has , and — ”
47471	47484	47129	47129	he	2673	“ Oh , no , it vas not _ my _ dog . ”
47485	47497	47129	47129	he	2673	“ Why , you _ said _ it was your dog . ”
47498	47507	47129	47129	he	2673	“ Oh , no , gaptain , I — ”
47508	47531	47129	47129	he	2673	“ It was a white dog , was n’t it , with his tail docked , and one ear gone , and — ”
47532	47559	47129	47129	he	2673	“ Dot ’s him , dot ’s him!—der fery dog . Wy , py Chorge , dot dog he would eat baint yoost de same like — ”
47560	47610	47617	47617	Barrow	191	“ Well , never mind that , now—‘vast heaving — I never saw such a man . You start him on that dog and he ’ll dispute a year . Blamed if I have n’t _ seen _ him keep it up a level two hours and a half . ”
47611	47615	47617	47617	Barrow	191	“ Why captain ! ”
47619	47627	47129	47129	he	2673	“ I guess that must be hearsay . ”
47628	47643	47129	47129	he	2673	“ No , sir , no hearsay about it — he disputed with me . ”
47644	47654	47617	47617	Barrow	191	“ I do n’t see how you stood it . ”
47655	47679	47129	47129	he	2673	“ Oh , you ’ve got to — if you run with Andy . But it ’s the only fault he ’s got . ”
47680	47689	47697	47698	the captain	2673	“ Ai n’t you afraid of acquiring it ? ”
47690	47695	47697	47698	the captain	2673	“ Oh , no , ”
47702	47711	47722	47722	his	191	“ no danger of that , I reckon . ”
47731	47850	47722	47722	his	191	“ Look me in the eye , my boy . Steady , steady . There — it ’s just as I thought — hoped , anyway ; _ you ’re _ all right , thank goodness . Nothing the matter with your mind . But do n’t do that again — even for fun . It is n’t wise . They would n’t have believed you if you ’d _ been _ an earl ’s son . Why , they _ couldn’t_—don’t you know that ? What ever possessed you to take such a freak ? But never mind about that ; let ’s not talk of it . It was a mistake ; you see that yourself . ”
47851	47861	47722	47722	his	191	“ Yes — it _ was _ a mistake . ”
47862	47917	47936	47936	He	191	“ Well , just drop it out of your mind ; it ’s no harm ; we all make them . Pull your courage together , and do n’t brood , and do n’t give up . I ’m at your back , and we ’ll pull through , do n’t you be afraid . ”
47941	48085	48439	48439	he	191	“ I ’m troubled about him . He never would have made a break like that if he had n’t been a little off his balance . But I know what being out of work and no prospect ahead can do for a man . First it knocks the pluck out of him and drags his pride in the dirt ; worry does the rest , and his mind gets shaky . I must talk to these people . No — if there ’s any humanity in them — and there is , at bottom — they’ll be easier on him if they think his troubles have disturbed his reason . But I ’ve _ got _ to find him some work ; work ’s the only medicine for his disease . Poor devil ! away off here , and not a friend . ”
48444	48569	48439	48439	he	191	“ Look here . I want to make a confession . I have got down , now , to where I am not only willing to acknowledge to myself that I am a shabby creature and full of false pride , but am willing to acknowledge it to you . Well , I ’ve been allowing you to wear yourself out hunting for work for me when there ’s been a chance open to me all the time . Forgive my pride — what was left of it . It is all gone , now , and I ’ve come to confess that if those ghastly artists want another confederate , I ’m their man — for at last I am dead to shame . ”
48570	48579	48439	48439	he	191	“ No ? Really , can you paint ? ”
48580	48635	48439	48439	he	191	“ Not as badly as _ they _ . No , I do n’t claim that , for I am not a genius ; in fact , I am a very indifferent amateur , a slouchy dabster , a mere artistic sarcasm ; but drunk or asleep I can beat _ those _ buccaneers . ”
48636	48727	48439	48439	he	191	“ Shake ! I want to shout ! Oh , I tell you , I am immensely delighted and relieved . Oh , just to work — that is life ! No matter what the work is — that ’s of no consequence . Just work itself is bliss when a man ’s been starving for it . I ’ve _ been _ there ! Come right along ; we ’ll hunt the old boys up . Do n’t you feel good ? I tell you _ I _ do . ”
48737	48739	48772	48772	Balaclava	227	“ works ”
48776	48813	48826	48826	They	2675	“ Here ’s the uncontented hackman , Tracy . Buckle to — deepen the sea - green to turf , turn the ship into a hearse . Let the boys have a taste of your quality . ”
48832	48861	48772	48772	Balaclava	227	“ My souls but she ’s a stunner , that hearse ! The hackman will just go all to pieces when he sees that wo n’t he Andy ? ”
48862	48910	49298	49298	He	110	“ Oh , it is sphlennid , sphlennid ! Herr Tracy , why haf you not said you vas a so sublime aartist ? Lob ’ Gott , of you had lif’d in Paris you would be a Pree de Rome , dot ’s votes de matter ! ”
49307	49344	49298	49298	He	110	“ Er — uh — by the way , Hawkins , we are feeling disappointed about this thing — the way the materializee is acting , I mean — we are disappointed ; you concede that ? ”
49345	49359	49298	49298	He	110	“ Concede it ? Why , yes , if you like the term . ”
49360	49415	49298	49298	He	110	“ Very well ; so far , so good . Now for the _ basis _ of the feeling . It is not that your heart , your affections are concerned ; that is to say , it is not that you _ want _ the materializee _ Itself _ . You concede that ? ”
49416	49427	49488	49489	the earl	537	“ Yes , I concede that , too — cordially . ”
49428	49486	49488	49489	the earl	537	“ Very well , again ; we are making progress . To sum up : The feeling , it is conceded , is not engendered by the mere conduct of the materializee ; it is conceded that it does not arise from any pang which the _ personality _ of the materializee could assuage . Now then , ”
49500	49530	49629	49629	he	114	“ the inexorable logic of the situation narrows us down to this : our feeling has its source in the _ money_-loss involved . Come — isn’t that so ? ”
49531	49543	49589	49593	The old , old seduction	1295	“ Goodness knows I concede that , with all my heart . ”
49544	49588	49629	49629	he	114	“ Very well . When you ’ve found out the source of a disease , you ’ve also found out what remedy is required — just as in this case . In this case money is required . And _ only _ money . ”
49632	49648	49629	49629	he	114	“ _ Only _ money ? Do you mean that you know a way to — ”
49649	49675	49629	49629	he	114	“ Washington , have you the impression that I have no resources but those I allow the public and my intimate friends to know about ? ”
49676	49683	49629	49629	he	114	“ Well , I — er — ”
49684	49751	49629	49629	he	114	“ Is it _ likely _ , do you think , that a man moved by nature and taught by experience to keep his affairs to himself and a cautious and reluctant tongue in his head , would n’t be thoughtful enough to keep a few resources in reserve for a rainy day , when he ’s got as many as I have to select from ? ”
49752	49766	49629	49629	he	114	“ Oh , you make me feel so much better already , Colonel ! ”
49767	49776	49629	49629	he	114	“ Have you ever been in my laboratory ? ”
49777	49782	49629	49629	he	114	“ Why , no . ”
49783	49869	49629	49629	he	114	“ That ’s it . You see you did n’t even know that I had one . Come along . I ’ve got a little trick there that I want to show you . I ’ve kept it perfectly quiet , not fifty people know anything about it . But that ’s my way , always been my way . Wait till you ’re _ ready _ , that ’s the idea ; and _ when _ you ’re ready , _ zzip!_—let her go ! ”
49870	49922	49923	49925	The old earl	1296	“ Well , Colonel , I ’ve never seen a man that I ’ve had such unbounded confidence in as you . When you say a thing right out , I always feel as if that ends it ; as if that is evidence , and proof , and everything else . ”
49932	49951	49629	49629	he	114	“ I ’m glad _ you _ believe in me , Washington ; not everybody is so just . ”
49952	49970	49923	49925	The old earl	1296	“ I always have believed in you ; and I always shall as long as I live . ”
49971	49991	49999	50000	the earl	537	“ Thank you , my boy . You sha n’t repent it . And you _ ca n’t _ . ”
49995	49998	49999	50000	the earl	537	“ laboratory , ”
50003	50065	49629	49629	he	114	“ Now , cast your eye around this room — what do you see ? _ Apparently _ a junk - shop ; _ apparently _ a hospital connected with a patent office — in _ reality _ , the mines of Golconda in disguise ! Look at that thing there . Now what would you take that thing to be ? ”
50066	50076	49629	49629	he	114	“ I do n’t believe I could ever imagine . ”
50077	50286	49999	50000	the earl	537	“ Of course you could n’t . It ’s my grand adaptation of the phonograph to the marine service . You store up profanity in it for use at sea . You know that sailors do n’t fly around worth a cent unless you swear at them — so the mate that can do the best job of swearing is the most valuable man . In great emergencies his talent saves the ship . But a ship is a large thing , and he ca n’t be everywhere at once ; so there have been times when one mate has lost a ship which could have been saved if they had had a hundred . Prodigious storms , you know . Well , a ship ca n’t afford a hundred mates ; but she can afford a hundred Cursing Phonographs , and distribute them all over the vessel — and there , you see , she ’s armed at every point . Imagine a big storm , and a hundred of my machines all cursing away at once — splendid spectacle , splendid!—you could n’t hear yourself think . Ship goes through that storm perfectly serene — she ’s just as safe as she ’d be on shore . ”
50287	50301	49629	49629	he	114	“ It ’s a wonderful idea . How do you prepare the thing ? ”
50302	50310	49629	49629	he	114	“ Load it — simply load it . ”
50311	50314	49999	50000	the earl	537	“ How ? ”
50315	50327	49629	49629	he	114	“ Why you just stand over it and swear into it . ”
50328	50336	49629	49629	he	114	“ That loads it , does it ? ”
50337	50394	49999	50000	the earl	537	“ Yes — because every word it collars , it _ keeps_—keeps it forever . Never wears out . Any time you turn the crank , out it ’ll come . In times of great peril , you can reverse it , and it ’ll swear backwards . _ That _ makes a sailor hump himself ! ”
50395	50406	49629	49629	he	114	“ O , I see . Who loads them?—the mate ? ”
50407	50599	49629	49629	he	114	“ Yes , if he chooses . Or I ’ll furnish them already loaded . I can hire an expert for $ 75 a month who will load a hundred and fifty phonographs in 150 hours , and do it _ easy _ . And an expert can furnish a stronger article , of course , than the mere average uncultivated mate could . Then you see , all the ships of the world will buy them ready loaded — for I shall have them loaded in any language a customer wants . Hawkins , it will work the grandest moral reform of the 19th century . Five years from now , _ all _ the swearing will be done by machinery — you wo n’t ever hear a profane word come from human lips on a ship . Millions of dollars have been spent by the churches , in the effort to abolish profanity in the commercial marine . Think of it — my name will live forever in the affections of good men as the man , who , solitary and alone , accomplished this noble and elevating reform . ”
50600	50640	49999	50000	the earl	537	“ O , it _ is _ grand and beneficent and beautiful . How _ did _ you ever come to think of it ? You have a wonderful mind . How did you say you loaded the machine ? ”
50641	50775	49629	49629	he	114	“ O , it ’s no trouble — perfectly simple . If you want to load it up loud and strong , you stand right over it and shout . But if you leave it open and all set , it ’ll _ eavesdrop _ , so to speak — that is to say , it will load itself up with any sounds that are made within six feet of it . Now I ’ll show you how it works . I had an expert come and load this one up yesterday . Hello , it ’s been left open — it ’s too bad — still I reckon it has n’t had much chance to collect irrelevant stuff . All you do is to press this button in the floor — so . ”
50809	50827	51573	51573	Sellers	110	“ Hang it , _ that _ ai n’t it . Somebody ’s been singing around here . ”
50907	50913	50966	50966	Hawkins	114	“ _ Scat _ , you devils”—and
50922	50965	50966	50966	Hawkins	114	“ Well , never mind — let it go . I ’ve got some sailor - profanity down in there somewhere , if I could get to it . But it is n’t any matter ; you see how the machine works . ”
50971	50988	51573	51573	Sellers	110	“ O , it works admirably ! I know there ’s a hundred fortunes in it . ”
50989	51002	51573	51573	Sellers	110	“ And mind , the Hawkins family get their share , Washington . ”
51003	51029	50966	50966	Hawkins	114	“ O , thanks , thanks ; you are just as generous as ever . Ah , it ’s the grandest invention of the age ! ”
51030	51141	51573	51573	Sellers	110	“ Ah , well ; we live in wonderful times . The elements are crowded _ full _ of beneficent forces — always _ have _ been — and ours is the first generation to turn them to account and make them work for us . Why Hawkins , _ everything _ is useful—_nothing _ ought ever to be wasted . Now look at sewer gas , for instance . Sewer gas has always been wasted , heretofore ; nobody tried to save up sewer - gas — you ca n’t name me a man . Ai n’t that so ? _ you _ know perfectly well it ’s so . ”
51142	51163	51573	51573	Sellers	110	“ Yes it is so — but I never — er — I do n’t quite see why a body — ”
51164	51255	50966	50966	Hawkins	114	“ Should _ want _ to save it up ? Well , I ’ll tell you . Do you see this little invention here?—it ’s a decomposer — I call it a decomposer . I give you my word of honor that if you show me a house that produces a given quantity of sewer - gas in a day , I ’ll engage to set up my decomposer there and make that house produce a hundred times that quantity of sewer - gas in less than half an hour . ”
51256	51267	51573	51573	Sellers	110	“ Dear me , but why should you want to ? ”
51268	51391	51573	51573	Sellers	110	“ _ Want _ to ? Listen , and you ’ll see . My boy , for illuminating purposes and economy combined , there ’s nothing in the world that begins with sewer - gas . And really , it do n’t cost a cent . You put in a good inferior article of plumbing,—such as you find everywhere — and add my decomposer , and there you are . Just use the ordinary gas pipes — and there your expense ends . Think of it . Why , Major , in five years from now you wo n’t see a house lighted with anything but sewer - gas . Every physician I talk to , recommends it ; and every plumber . ”
51392	51399	50966	50966	Hawkins	114	“ But is n’t it dangerous ? ”
51400	51428	51573	51573	Sellers	110	“ O , yes , more or less , but everything is — coal gas , candles , electricity — there is n’t anything that ai n’t . ”
51429	51438	51573	51573	Sellers	110	“ It lights up well , does it ? ”
51439	51444	50966	50966	Hawkins	114	“ O , magnificently . ”
51445	51454	51573	51573	Sellers	110	“ Have you given it a good trial ? ”
51455	51541	51573	51573	Sellers	110	“ Well , no , not a first rate one . Polly ’s prejudiced , and she wo n’t let me put it in here ; but I ’m playing my cards to get it adopted in the President ’s house , and _ then _ it ’ll go — don’t you doubt it . I shall not need this one for the present , Washington ; you may take it down to some boarding - house and give it a trial if you like . ”
51585	51613	51619	51620	The Colonel	374	“ Well , this . Have you got some secret project in your head which requires a Bank of England back of it to make it succeed ? ”
51628	51640	51573	51573	Sellers	110	“ Why , Hawkins , are you a mind - reader ? ”
51641	51652	51573	51573	Sellers	110	“ I ? I never thought of such a thing . ”
51653	51725	51831	51832	The earl	537	“ Well , then how did you happen to drop onto that idea in this curious fashion ? It ’s just mind - reading , that ’s what it is , though you may not know it . Because I _ have _ got a private project that requires a Bank of England at its back . How could you divine that ? What was the process ? This is interesting . ”
51726	51830	51847	51847	he	114	“ There was n’t any process . A thought like this happened to slip through my head by accident : How much would make you or me comfortable ? A hundred thousand . Yet you are expecting two or three of — these inventions of yours to turn out some billions of money — and you are _ wanting _ them to do that . If you wanted ten millions , I could understand that — it ’s inside the human limits . But billions ! That ’s clear outside the limits . There must be a definite project back of that somewhere . ”
51853	51967	51573	51573	Sellers	110	“ It ’s wonderfully reasoned out , Washington , it certainly is . It shows what I think is quite extraordinary penetration . For you ’ve hit it ; you ’ve driven the centre , you ’ve plugged the bulls - eye of my dream . Now I ’ll tell you the whole thing , and you ’ll understand it . I do n’t need to ask you to keep it to yourself , because you ’ll see that the project will prosper all the better for being kept in the background till the right time . Have you noticed how many pamphlets and books I ’ve got lying around relating to Russia ? ”
51968	51985	52015	52015	He	1304	“ Yes , I think most anybody would notice that — anybody who was n’t dead . ”
51986	52014	52015	52015	He	1304	“ Well , I ’ve been posting myself a good while . That ’s a great and , splendid nation , and deserves to be set free . ”
52030	52044	51573	51573	Sellers	110	“ When I get this money I ’m going to set it free . ”
52045	52049	51573	51573	Sellers	110	“ Great guns ! ”
52050	52060	52015	52015	He	1304	“ Why , what makes you jump like that ? ”
52061	52166	51573	51573	Sellers	110	“ Dear me , when you are going to drop a remark under a man ’s chair that is likely to blow him out through the roof , why do n’t you put some expression , some force , some noise into it that will prepare him ? You should n’t flip out such a gigantic thing as this in that colorless kind of a way . You do jolt a person up , so . Go on , now , I am all right again . Tell me all about it . I ’m all interest — yes , and sympathy , too . ”
52167	52378	51573	51573	Sellers	110	“ Well , I ’ve looked the ground over , and concluded that the methods of the Russian patriots , while good enough considering the way the boys are hampered , are not the best ; at least not the quickest . They are trying to revolutionize Russia from _ within ; _ that ’s pretty slow , you know , and liable to interruption all the time , and is full of perils for the workers . Do you know how Peter the Great started his army ? He did n’t start it on the family premises under the noses of the Strelitzes ; no , he started it away off yonder , privately,—only just one regiment , you know , and he built to _ that _ . The first thing the Strelitzes knew , the regiment was an _ army _ , their position was turned , and they had to take a walk . Just that little idea _ made _ the biggest and worst of all the despotisms the world has seen . The same idea can _ un_make it . I ’m going to prove it . I ’m going to get out to one side and work my scheme the way Peter did . ”
52379	52396	52015	52015	He	1304	“ This is mighty interesting , Rossmore . What is it you are going to do ? ”
52397	52409	51573	51573	Sellers	110	“ I am going to buy Siberia and start a republic . ”
52410	52428	51573	51573	Sellers	110	“ There,—bang you go again , without giving any notice ! Going to _ buy _ it ? ”
52429	52537	51573	51573	Sellers	110	“ Yes , as soon as I get the money . I do n’t care what the price is , I shall take it . I can afford it , and I will . Now then , consider this — and you ’ve never thought of it , I ’ll warrant . Where is the place where there is twenty - five times more manhood , pluck , true heroism , unselfishness , devotion to high and noble ideals , adoration of liberty , wide education , and _ brains _ , per thousand of population , than any other domain in the whole world can show ? ”
52538	52541	52015	52015	He	1304	“ Siberia ! ”
52542	52545	51573	51573	Sellers	110	“ Right . ”
52546	52564	51573	51573	Sellers	110	“ It is true ; it certainly is true , but I never thought of it before . ”
52565	52662	52015	52015	He	1304	“ Nobody ever thinks of it . But it ’s so , just the same . In those mines and prisons are gathered together the very finest and noblest and capablest multitude of human beings that God is able to create . Now if you had that kind of a population to sell , would you offer it to a despotism ? No , the despotism has no use for it ; you would lose money . A despotism has no use for anything but human cattle . But suppose you want to start a republic ? ”
52663	52677	51573	51573	Sellers	110	“ Yes , I see . It ’s just the material for it . ”
52678	52838	51573	51573	Sellers	110	“ Well , I should say so ! There ’s Siberia with just the very finest and choicest material on the globe for a republic , and more coming — more coming all the time , do n’t you see ! It is being daily , weekly , monthly recruited by the most perfectly devised system that has ever been invented , perhaps . By this system the whole of the hundred millions of Russia are being constantly and patiently sifted , sifted , sifted , by myriads of trained experts , spies appointed by the Emperor personally ; and whenever they catch a man , woman or child that has got any brains or education or character , they ship that person straight to Siberia . It is admirable , it is wonderful . It is so searching and so effective that it keeps the general level of Russian intellect and education down to that of the Czar . ”
52839	52847	52905	52905	He	1305	“ Come , that sounds like exaggeration . ”
52848	52904	52943	52943	he	1305	“ Well , it ’s what they say anyway . But I think , myself , it ’s a lie . And it does n’t seem right to slander a whole nation that way , anyhow . Now , then , you see what the material is , there in Siberia , for a republic . ”
52956	53063	53092	53092	he	1305	“ The minute I organize that republic , the light of liberty , intelligence , justice , humanity , bursting from it , flooding from it , flaming from it , will concentrate the gaze of the whole astonished world as upon the miracle of a new sun ; Russia ’s countless multitudes of slaves will rise up and march , march!—eastward , with that great light transfiguring their faces as they come , and far back of them you will see - what will you see?—a vacant throne in an empty land ! It can be done , and by God I will do it ! ”
53098	53128	53092	53092	he	1305	“ I must ask you to pardon me , Major Hawkins . I have never used that expression before , and I beg you will forgive it this time . ”
53134	53190	53212	53212	he	537	“ You see , Washington , it is an error which I am by nature not liable to . Only excitable people , impulsive people , are exposed to it . But the circumstances of the present case — I being a democrat by birth and preference , and an aristocrat by inheritance and relish — ”
53223	53226	53212	53212	he	537	“ Look ! ”
53227	53236	53212	53212	he	537	“ What _ is _ it , Colonel ? ”
53237	53242	53212	53212	he	537	“ _ It ! _ ”
53243	53246	53291	53291	He	537	“ No ! ”
53247	53290	53291	53291	He	537	“ Sure as you ’re born . Keep perfectly still . I ’ll apply the influence — I’ll turn on all my force . I ’ve brought It thus far — I’ll fetch It right into the house . You ’ll see . ”
53305	53320	53357	53357	they	1309	“ There ! Look at that . I ’ve made It smile ! See ? ”
53366	53379	53418	53418	Tracy	218	“ Look , Hawkins , look ! I ’m drawing It over ! ”
53380	53417	53435	53435	he	218	“ You ’re drawing it sure , Rossmore . If I ever had any doubts about materialization , they ’re gone , now , and gone for good . Oh , this is a joyful day ! ”
53441	53453	53479	53479	Sellers	110	“ Why , manifestly these are the American Claimant ’s quarters . ”
53454	53478	53507	53507	he	2451	“ It ’s coming — coming right along . I ’ll slide , down and pull It in . You follow after me . ”
53522	53532	53507	53507	he	2451	“ Walk in , walk right in , Mr.—er — ”
53533	53539	53554	53554	Tracy	218	“ Tracy — Howard Tracy . ”
53540	53553	53554	53554	Tracy	218	“ Tracy — thanks — walk right in , you ’re expected . ”
53563	53574	53584	53584	Sellers	110	“ Expected ? I think there must be some mistake . ”
53575	53582	53621	53621	he	218	“ Oh , I judge not , ”
53626	53632	53621	53621	he	218	impressively—“I am—_You Know Who _ . ”
53662	53699	53714	53715	The earl	537	“ No , pardon me . I do n’t _ know _ who you are . I only suppose — but no doubt correctly — that you are the gentleman whose title is on the doorplate . ”
53700	53713	53761	53761	He	218	“ Right , quite right — sit down , pray sit down . ”
53767	53818	53761	53761	He	218	“ But a thousand pardons , dear sir , I am forgetting courtesies due to a guest and stranger . Let me introduce my friend General Hawkins — General Hawkins , our new Senator — Senator from the latest and grandest addition to the radiant galaxy of sovereign States , Cherokee Strip”—(to

53845	53856	53893	53894	the Colonel	374	amazed),—“Senator Hawkins , Mr. Howard Tracy , of — er — ”
53857	53860	53893	53894	the Colonel	374	“ England . ”
53861	53868	53837	53838	the Colonel	374	“ England!—Why that ’s i m — ”
53869	53878	53893	53894	the Colonel	374	“ England , yes , native of England . ”
53879	53884	53893	53894	the Colonel	374	“ Recently from there ? ”
53885	53891	53893	53894	the Colonel	374	“ Yes , quite recently . ”
53898	53934	53893	53894	the Colonel	374	“ This phantom lies like an expert . Purifying this kind by fire do n’t work . I ’ll sound him a little further , give him another chance or two to work his gift . ”
53942	53971	53893	53894	the Colonel	374	“ Visiting our great country for recreation and amusement , no doubt . I suppose you find that traveling in the majestic expanses of our Far West is — ”
53972	54014	54020	54020	Hawkins	232	“ I have n’t been West , and have n’t been devoting myself to amusement with any sort of exclusiveness , I assure you . In fact , to merely live , an artist has got to work , not play . ”
54015	54018	54020	54020	Hawkins	232	“ Artist ! ”
54030	54040	54051	54052	the colonel	374	“ that _ is _ a name for it ! ”
54041	54049	54057	54057	himself	374	“ Are _ you _ an artist ? ”
54059	54070	54020	54020	Hawkins	232	“ _ now _ I ’m going to catch him . ”
54071	54079	54086	54088	the sly veteran	1319	“ In a humble way , yes . ”
54080	54084	54086	54088	the sly veteran	1319	“ What line ? ”
54090	54093	54104	54104	himself	110	“ Oils . ”
54094	54100	54104	54104	himself	110	“ I ’ve got him ! ”
54109	54129	54086	54088	the sly veteran	1319	“ This is fortunate . Could I engage you to restore some of my paintings that need that attention ? ”
54130	54143	54195	54195	his	374	“ I shall be very glad . Pray let me see them . ”
54201	54206	54217	54218	The colonel	374	“ This del Sarto — ”
54207	54216	54217	54218	The colonel	374	“ Is _ that _ a del Sarto ? ”
54243	54297	54217	54218	The colonel	374	“ This del Sarto is perhaps the only original of that sublime master in our country . You see , yourself , that the work is of such exceeding delicacy that the risk — could — er — would you mind giving me a little example of what you can do before we — ”
54298	54311	54398	54399	The earl	537	“ Cheerfully , cheerfully . I will copy one of these marvels . ”
54402	54419	54590	54590	he	1327	“ The mystery that bothers me , is , where did It get its other arm ? ”
54420	54449	54590	54590	he	1327	“ Yes — it worries me , too . And another thing troubles me — the apparition is English . How do you account for that , Colonel ? ”
54450	54473	54398	54399	The earl	537	“ Honestly , I do n’t know , Hawkins , I do n’t really know . It is very confusing and awful . ”
54474	54488	54590	54590	he	1327	“ Do n’t you think maybe we ’ve waked up the wrong one ? ”
54489	54502	54627	54627	he	1327	“ The wrong one ? How do you account for the clothes ? ”
54503	54552	54590	54590	he	1327	“ The clothes _ are _ right , there ’s no getting around it . What are we going to do ? We ca n’t collect , as I see . The reward is for a one - armed American . This is a two - armed Englishman . ”
54553	54588	54627	54627	he	1327	“ Well , it may be that that is not objectionable . You see it is n’t _ less _ than is called for , it is _ more _ , and so , — ”
54632	54718	54729	54729	Hawkins	232	“ Hawkins , this materialization is a grander and nobler science than we have dreamed of . We have little imagined what a solemn and stupendous thing we have done . The whole secret is perfectly clear to me , now , clear as day . _ Every man is made up of heredities _ , long - descended atoms and particles of his ancestors . This present materialization is incomplete . We have only brought it down to perhaps the beginning of this century . ”
54719	54727	54627	54627	he	1327	“ What do you mean , Colonel ! ”
54747	54758	54627	54627	he	1327	“ This . We ’ve materialized this burglar ’s ancestor ! ”
54759	54772	54627	54627	he	1327	“ Oh , don’t — don’t say that . It ’s hideous . ”
54773	54841	54627	54627	he	1327	“ But it ’s true , Hawkins , I _ know _ it . Look at the facts . This apparition is distinctly English — note that . It uses good grammar — note that . It is an Artist — note that . It has the manners and carriage of a gentleman — note that . Where ’s your cow - boy ? Answer me that . ”
54842	54857	54627	54627	he	1327	“ Rossmore , this is dreadful — it ’s too dreadful to think of ! ”
54858	54880	54627	54627	he	1327	“ Never resurrected a rag of that burglar but the clothes , not a solitary rag of him but the clothes . ”
54881	54889	54893	54893	his	374	“ Colonel , do you really mean — ”
54901	54926	54937	54937	Hawkins	232	“ I mean exactly this . This materialization was immature , the burglar has evaded us , this is nothing but a damned ancestor ! ”
54941	54950	54627	54627	he	1327	“ It ’s a bitter disappointment — bitter . ”
54951	55018	55025	55025	Hawkins	232	“ I know it . I know it , Senator ; I feel it as deeply as anybody could . But we ’ve got to submit — on moral grounds . I need money , but God knows I am not poor enough or shabby enough to be an accessory to the punishing of a man ’s ancestor for crimes committed by that ancestor ’s posterity . ”
55019	55023	55025	55025	Hawkins	232	“ But Colonel ! ”
55027	55107	55133	55133	he	374	“ stop and think ; do n’t be rash ; you know it ’s the _ only _ chance we ’ve got to get the money ; and besides , the Bible itself says posterity to the fourth generation shall be punished for the sins and crimes committed by ancestors four generations back that had n’t anything to do with them ; and so it ’s only fair to turn the rule around and make it work both ways . ”
55136	55192	55201	55201	Hawkins	232	“ There ’s reason in it ; yes , there ’s reason in it . And so , although it seems a piteous thing to sweat this poor ancient devil for a burglary he had n’t the least hand in , still if duty commands I suppose we must give him up to the authorities . ”
55193	55199	55201	55201	Hawkins	232	“ _ I _ would , ”
55207	55223	55238	55238	Sellers	95	“ I ’d give him up if he was a thousand ancestors compacted into one . ”
55224	55236	55238	55238	Sellers	95	“ Lord bless me , that ’s just what he is , ”
55246	55350	55201	55201	Hawkins	232	“ it ’s exactly what he is ; there ’s a contribution in him from every ancestor he ever had . In him there ’s atoms of priests , soldiers , crusaders , poets , and sweet and gracious women — all kinds and conditions of folk who trod this earth in old , old centuries , and vanished out of it ages ago , and now by act of ours they are summoned from their holy peace to answer for gutting a one - horse bank away out on the borders of Cherokee Strip , and it ’s just a howling outrage ! ”
55351	55383	55201	55201	Hawkins	232	“ Oh , do n’t talk like that , Colonel ; it takes the heart all out of me , and makes me ashamed of the part I am proposing to — ”
55384	55391	55238	55238	Sellers	95	“ Wait — I’ve got it ! ”
55392	55405	55201	55201	Hawkins	232	“ A saving hope ? Shout it out , I am perishing . ”
55406	55475	55487	55487	Hawkins	232	“ It ’s perfectly simple ; a child would have thought of it . He is all right , not a flaw in him , as far as I have carried the work . If I ’ve been able to bring him as far as the beginning of this century , what ’s to stop me now ? I ’ll go on and materialize him down to date . ”
55476	55485	55487	55487	Hawkins	232	“ Land , I never thought of that ! ”
55494	55516	55238	55238	Sellers	95	“ It ’s the very thing . What a brain you have got ! And will he shed the superfluous arm ? ”
55517	55521	55238	55238	Sellers	95	“ He will . ”
55522	55529	55487	55487	Hawkins	232	“ And lose his English accent ? ”
55530	55548	55238	55238	Sellers	95	“ It will wholly disappear . He will speak Cherokee Strip — and other forms of profanity . ”
55549	55557	55238	55238	Sellers	95	“ Colonel , maybe he ’ll confess ! ”
55558	55566	55583	55583	his	95	“ Confess ? Merely that bank robbery ? ”
55567	55578	55583	55583	his	95	“ Merely ? Yes , but why ‘ merely ’ ? ”
55588	55622	55238	55238	Sellers	95	“ Hawkins , he will be wholly under my command . I will make him confess every crime he ever committed . There must be a thousand . Do you get the idea ? ”
55623	55629	55238	55238	Sellers	95	“ Well — not quite . ”
55630	55638	55583	55583	his	95	“ The rewards will come to us . ”
55639	55668	55238	55238	Sellers	95	“ Prodigious conception ! I _ never _ saw such a head for seeing with a lightning glance all the outlying ramifications and possibilities of a central idea . ”
55669	55741	55238	55238	Sellers	95	“ It is nothing ; it comes natural to me . When his time is out in one jail he goes to the next and the next , and we shall have nothing to do but collect the rewards as he goes along . It is a perfectly steady income as long as we live , Hawkins . And much better than other kinds of investments , because he is indestructible . ”
55742	55759	55583	55583	his	95	“ It looks — it really does look the way you say ; it does indeed . ”
55760	55806	55238	55238	Sellers	95	“ Look?—why it _ is _ . It will not be denied that I have had a pretty wide and comprehensive financial experience , and I do not hesitate to say that I consider this one of the most valuable properties I have ever controlled . ”
55807	55814	55238	55238	Sellers	95	“ Do you really think so ? ”
55815	55821	55583	55583	his	95	“ I do , indeed . ”
55822	55860	55238	55238	Sellers	95	“ O , Colonel , the wasting grind and grief of poverty ! If we could realize immediately . I do n’t mean sell it all , but sell part — enough , you know , to — ”
55861	56031	55238	55238	Sellers	95	“ See how you tremble with excitement . That comes of lack of experience . My boy , when you have been familiar with vast operations as long as I have , you ’ll be different . Look at me ; is my eye dilated ? do you notice a quiver anywhere ? Feel my pulse : plunk - plunk - plunk — same as if I were asleep . And yet , what is passing through my calm cold mind ? A procession of figures which would make a financial novice drunk just the sight of them . Now it is by keeping cool , and looking at a thing all around , that a man sees what ’s really in it , and saves himself from the novice ’s unfailing mistake — the one you ’ve just suggested — eagerness to _ realize _ . Listen to me . Your idea is to sell a part of him for ready cash . Now mine is — guess . ”
56032	56043	55583	55583	his	95	“ I have n’t an idea . What is it ? ”
56044	56051	55238	55238	Sellers	95	“ Stock him — of course . ”
56052	56063	55238	55238	Sellers	95	“ Well , I should never have thought of that . ”
56064	56142	55583	55583	his	95	“ Because you are not a financier . Say he has committed a thousand crimes . Certainly that ’s a low estimate . By the look of him , even in his unfinished condition , he has committed all of a million . But call it only a thousand to be perfectly safe ; five thousand reward , multiplied by a thousand , gives us a dead sure cash basis of — what ? Five million dollars ! ”
56143	56152	55583	55583	his	95	“ Wait — let me get my breath . ”
56153	56179	55238	55238	Sellers	95	“ And the property indestructible . Perpetually fruitful — perpetually ; for a property with his disposition will go on committing crimes and winning rewards . ”
56180	56191	55238	55238	Sellers	95	“ You daze me , you make my head whirl ! ”
56192	56257	55583	55583	his	95	“ Let it whirl , it wo n’t do it any harm . Now that matter is all fixed — leave it alone . I ’ll get up the company and issue the stock , all in good time . Just leave it in my hands . I judge you do n’t doubt my ability to work it up for all it is worth . ”
56258	56271	55238	55238	Sellers	95	“ Indeed I do n’t . I can say that with truth . ”
56272	56340	55583	55583	his	95	“ All right , then . That ’s disposed of . Everything in its turn . We old operators , go by order and system — no helter - skelter business with us . What ’s the next thing on the docket ? The carrying on of the materialization — the bringing it down to date . I will begin on that at once . I think — “
56361	56362	56373	56373	yourself	110	” “
56377	56378	56392	56392	it	1333	” “

56572	56602	56609	56609	Washington	114	” The earl pointed significantly — and interrogatively toward the sky . Hawkins started ; then settled into deep reflection ; finally shook his head sorrowfully and pointed downwards . “
56611	56612	56628	56628	he	1337	” “
56640	56641	56661	56661	I	0	” “
56681	56682	56705	56705	I	0	” “

56760	56761	56803	56803	she	1341	” “
56806	56807	56841	56843	a young artist	1342	” “
56833	56834	56893	56893	him	236	” “
56895	56896	56941	56941	he	236	” “
56926	56939	56941	56941	he	236	snack”—(Sellers delivered a large wink to Hawkins from behind his hand ) , “
56950	56957	56970	56970	he	236	” ( another sarcastic wink ) ; “
56963	56968	56970	56970	he	236	” ( doublewink ) , “
56976	56977	56970	56970	he	236	” “
56980	57031	57037	57037	you	236	” and the colonel sprang some yards toward the ceiling and came down quaking with astonishment . Lady Rossmore was smitten dumb with amazement . She gazed at the sheepish relic of Cherokee Strip , then at her husband , and then at the guest again . Finally she said : “
57041	57075	57037	57037	you	236	” He did not answer immediately . His back was turned ; he was bending over his chair , feeling the seat of it . But he answered next moment , and said : “
57087	57102	57128	57128	I	0	” The lady contemplated him doubtfully a moment , then said , pretty snappishly : “
57139	57168	57286	57286	I	0	” And she turned on her heel and went her way . As soon as she was safely out , the Colonel said , in a suppressed voice : “
57185	57285	57624	57624	he	336	” They hurried softly down and peeped in . Sellers whispered , in a sort of despair — It _ is _ eating ! What a grisly spectacle ! Hawkins it ’s horrible ! Take me away — I ca n’t stand it . They tottered back to the laboratory . CHAPTER XX . Tracy made slow progress with his work , for his mind wandered a good deal . Many things were puzzling him . Finally a light burst upon him all of a sudden — seemed to , at any rate — and he said to himself , “
57645	57652	57693	57693	I	0	” The colonel muttered to himself , “
57725	57732	57782	57782	I	0	” He approached and said affably : “
57788	57789	57782	57782	I	0	” “
57799	57800	57807	57807	I	0	” “
57816	57878	57893	57893	He	1362	” Tracy laughed and said they were not ethereal enough to be very easily discommoded . The colonel asked a number of cautious and well - considered questions — questions which seemed pretty odd and flighty to Tracy — but the answers conveyed the information desired , apparently , for the colonel said to himself , with mixed pride and gratification : “
57909	57910	57917	57917	I	0	” “
57925	57933	57917	57917	I	0	” After a little he asked , warily “
57945	57946	57917	57917	I	0	” “
57951	57952	57917	57917	I	0	” “
57962	57979	57917	57917	I	0	” Tracy ’s thought flew to his boarding - house , and he answered with decision . “
57988	57999	58029	58029	I	0	” The colonel was startled , and said to himself , “
58037	58058	58094	58094	He	1362	” He sat thinking , and thinking , and watching the brush go . At length he said to himself , “
58099	58154	58156	58156	he	1362	” Sally Sellers entered from the street , now , looking her divinest , and the artist was introduced to her . It was a violent case of mutual love at first sight , though neither party was entirely aware of the fact , perhaps . The Englishman made this irrelevant remark to himself , “
58164	58224	58255	58255	I	0	” Sally sat down , and showed an interest in Tracy ’s work which greatly pleased him , and a benevolent forgiveness of it which convinced him that the girl ’s nature was cast in a large mould . Sellers was anxious to report his discoveries to Hawkins ; so he took his leave , saying that if the two “
58231	58254	58079	58079	He	1362	” thought they could manage without him , he would go and look after his affairs . The artist said to himself , “
58270	58575	58813	58813	he	1365	” He reproached himself for having injuriously judged a man without giving him any fair chance to show what he really was . p204.jpg ( 29 K ) Of course the stranger was very soon at his ease and chatting along comfortably . The average American girl possesses the valuable qualities of naturalness , honesty , and inoffensive straightforwardness ; she is nearly barren of troublesome conventions and artificialities , consequently her presence and her ways are unembarrassing , and one is acquainted with her and on the pleasantest terms with her before he knows how it came about . This new acquaintanceship — friendship , indeed — progressed swiftly ; and the unusual swiftness of it , and the thoroughness of it are sufficiently evidenced and established by one noteworthy fact — that within the first half hour both parties had ceased to be conscious of Tracy ’s clothes . Later this consciousness was re - awakened ; it was then apparent to Gwendolen that she was almost reconciled to them , and it was apparent to Tracy that he was n’t . The re - awakening was brought about by Gwendolen ’s inviting the artist to stay to dinner . He had to decline , because he wanted to live , now — that is , now that there was something to live for — and he could not survive in those clothes at a gentleman ’s table . He thought he knew that . But he went away happy , for he saw that Gwendolen was disappointed . And whither did he go ? He went straight to a slopshop and bought as neat and reasonably well - fitting a suit of clothes as an Englishman could be persuaded to wear . He said—_to _ himself , but _ at _ his conscience—“I
58602	58808	59343	59343	I	0	” This satisfied him , and made his heart light . Perhaps it will also satisfy the reader — if he can make out what it means . The old people were troubled about Gwendolen at dinner , because she was so distraught and silent . If they had noticed , they would have found that she was sufficiently alert and interested whenever the talk stumbled upon the artist and his work ; but they did n’t notice , and so the chat would swap around to some other subject , and then somebody would presently be privately worrying about Gwendolen again , and wondering if she were not well , or if something had gone wrong in the millinery line . Her mother offered her various reputable patent medicines , and tonics with iron and other hardware in them , and her father even proposed to send out for wine , relentless prohibitionist and head of the order in the District of Columbia as he was , but these kindnesses were all declined — thankfully , but with decision . At bedtime , when the family were breaking up for the night , she privately looted one of the brushes , saying to herself , “
58820	59342	59369	59369	she	1367	” The next morning Tracy went forth wearing his new suit , and equipped with a pink in his button - hole — a daily attention from Puss . His whole soul was full of Gwendolen Sellers , and this condition was an inspiration , art - wise . All the morning his brush pawed nimbly away at the canvases , almost without his awarity — awarity , in this sense being the sense of being aware , though disputed by some authorities — turning out marvel upon marvel , in the way of decorative accessories to the portraits , with a felicity and celerity which amazed the veterans of the firm and fetched out of them continuous explosions of applause . Meantime Gwendolen was losing her morning , and many dollars . She supposed Tracy was coming in the forenoon — a conclusion which she had jumped to without outside help . So she tripped down stairs every little while from her work - parlor to arrange the brushes and things over again , and see if he had arrived . And when she was in her work - parlor it was not profitable , but just the other way — as she found out to her sorrow . She had put in her idle moments during the last little while back , in designing a particularly rare and capable gown for herself , and this morning she set about making it up ; but she was absent minded , and made an irremediable botch of it . When she saw what she had done , she knew the reason of it and the meaning of it ; and she put her work away from her and said she would accept the sign . And from that time forth she came no more away from the Audience Chamber , but remained there and waited . After luncheon she waited again . A whole hour . Then a great joy welled up in her heart , for she saw him coming . So she flew back up stairs thankful , and could hardly wait for him to miss the principal brush , which she had mislaid down there , but knew where she had mislaid it . However , all in good time the others were called in and could n’t find the brush , and then she was sent for , and she could n’t find it herself for some little time ; but then she found it when the others had gone away to hunt in the kitchen and down cellar and in the woodshed , and all those other places where people look for things whose ways they are not familiar with . So she gave him the brush , and remarked that she ought to have seen that everything was ready for him , but it had n’t seemed necessary , because it was so early that she was n’t expecting — but she stopped there , surprised at herself for what she was saying ; and he felt caught and ashamed , and said to himself , “
59386	59486	59533	59533	I	0	” Gwendolen was very much pleased , on one account , and a little the other way in another ; pleased with the new clothes and the improvement which they had achieved ; less pleased by the pink in the buttonhole . Yesterday ’s pink had hardly interested her ; this one was just like it , but somehow it had got her immediate attention , and kept it . She wished she could think of some way of getting at its history in a properly colorless and indifferent way . Presently she made a venture . She said : “
59531	59532	59547	59547	I	0	” “
59556	59557	59609	59609	him	1806	” “
59576	59577	59609	59609	him	1806	” “
59581	59587	59605	59605	They	1369	” he said , simply , “
59603	59604	59605	59605	They	1369	” “
59611	59626	59682	59682	he	1806	” she said to herself , and she felt a coldness toward that pink . “
59639	59678	59679	59679	I	0	” The flower began to take up a good deal of room ; it obtruded itself everywhere , it intercepted all views , and marred them ; it was becoming exceedingly annoying and conspicuous for a little thing . “
59687	59936	59679	59679	I	0	” That thought gave her a quite definite pain . CHAPTER XXI . She had made everything comfortable for the artist ; there was no further pretext for staying . So she said she would go , now , and asked him to summon the servants in case he should need anything . She went away unhappy ; and she left unhappiness behind her ; for she carried away all the sunshine . The time dragged heavily for both , now . He could n’t paint for thinking of her ; she could n’t design or millinerize with any heart , for thinking of him . Never before had painting seemed so empty to him , never before had millinerizing seemed so void of interest to her . She had gone without repeating that dinner - invitation — an almost unendurable disappointment to him . On her part - well , she was suffering , too ; for she had found she _ could n’t _ invite him . It was not hard yesterday , but it was impossible to - day . A thousand innocent privileges seemed to have been filched from her unawares in the past twenty - four hours . To - day she felt strangely hampered , restrained of her liberty . To - day she could n’t propose to herself to do anything or say anything concerning this young man without being instantly paralyzed into non - action by the fear that he might “
59939	60293	60399	60399	I	0	” Invite him to dinner _ to - day ? _ It made her shiver to think of it . And so her afternoon was one long fret . Broken at intervals . Three times she had to go down stairs on errands — that is , she thought she had to go down stairs on errands . Thus , going and coming , she had six glimpses of him , in the aggregate , without seeming to look in his direction ; and she tried to endure these electric ecstasies without showing any sign , but they fluttered her up a good deal , and she felt that the naturalness she was putting on was overdone and quite too frantically sober and hysterically calm to deceive . The painter had his share of the rapture ; he had his six glimpses , and they smote him with waves of pleasure that assaulted him , beat upon him , washed over him deliciously , and drowned out all consciousness of what he was doing with his brush . So there were six places in his canvas which had to be done over again . p210.jpg ( 23 K ) At last Gwendolen got some peace of mind by sending word to the Thompsons , in the neighborhood , that she was coming there to dinner . She would n’t be reminded , at _ that _ table , that there was an absentee who ought to be a presentee — a word which she meant to look out in the dictionary at a calmer time . About this time the old earl dropped in for a chat with the artist , and invited him to stay to dinner . Tracy cramped down his joy and gratitude by a sudden and powerful exercise of all his forces ; and he felt that now that he was going to be close to Gwendolen , and hear her voice and watch her face during several precious hours , earth had nothing valuable to add to his life for the present . The earl said to himself , “
60380	60398	60399	60399	I	0	” The new clothes gave him a thrill of pleasure and pride . He said to himself , “
60411	60652	60677	60678	a relative	1813	” Sellers said he was pleased with Tracy ’s work ; and he went on and engaged him to restore his old masters , and said he should also want him to paint his portrait and his wife ’s and possibly his daughter ’s . The tide of the artist ’s happiness was at flood , now . The chat flowed pleasantly along while Tracy painted and Sellers carefully unpacked a picture which he had brought with him . It was a chromo ; a new one , just out . It was the smirking , self - satisfied portrait of a man who was inundating the Union with advertisements inviting everybody to buy his specialty , which was a three - dollar shoe or a dress - suit or something of that kind . The old gentleman rested the chromo flat upon his lap and gazed down tenderly upon it , and became silent and meditative . Presently Tracy noticed that he was dripping tears on it . This touched the young fellow ’s sympathetic nature , and at the same time gave him the painful sense of being an intruder upon a sacred privacy , an observer of emotions which a stranger ought not to witness . But his pity rose superior to other considerations , and compelled him to try to comfort the old mourner with kindly words and a show of friendly interest . He said : “
60664	60665	60677	60678	a relative	1813	” “
60719	60720	60677	60678	a relative	1813	” “

60787	60814	60868	60868	We	1381	” said Sellers , holding up the chromo and glancing from it to the chromo misrepresenting the Usurping Earl and back again with an approving eye . “
60866	60867	60868	60868	We	1381	” “
60881	60887	60941	60941	fools	1384	” said Sellers , undisturbed . “
60945	60946	60965	60965	he	3007	” “

61004	61010	61015	61015	I	0	” said Tracy , involuntarily . “

61312	61319	61397	61397	he	1401	” Then he said , aloud , “
61392	61393	61430	61430	he	1401	” “
61440	61441	61447	61447	He	1401	” “

61534	61535	61521	61522	a Rossmore	1405	” “
61538	61539	61577	61578	a Wobbler	1393	” “
61616	61622	61682	61686	A most extraordinary young man	1411	” He added to himself , “
61688	61695	61728	61728	you	1412	” He presently said , aloud : “
61731	61732	61743	61743	You	0	” “
61749	61750	61743	61743	You	0	” “

61888	61889	61894	61894	papa	2175	” “
61896	61910	61928	61929	Mr. Tracy	179	” Tracy was aghast . The colonel said , in a disappointed voice : “
61931	61952	61968	61975	a good team , that ’s a fact	1422	” Gwendolen ’s face began to take on a sort of apprehensive What - have - I - done expression . “
61977	62004	62017	62017	I	0	” Gwendolen ’s face betrayed a dawning hopefulness and she said — with a tone of reluctance which had n’t the hall - mark on it — “
62019	62020	62048	62048	You	2175	” “
62056	62057	62059	62059	papa	2175	” “

62132	62186	62299	62299	I	0	” Gwendolen was ready to cry with vexation . But there was nothing to do but start ; which she was about to do when her father hit upon an idea which filled him with delight because it so deftly covered all the difficulties of the situation and made things smooth and satisfactory : “
62282	62298	62334	62334	I	0	” He turned — she was already passing out at the gate . He muttered , “
62326	62333	62527	62530	a most wonderful character	1440	” said Sellers blithely to Tracy , “
62507	62524	62631	62640	the profoundest master of dissimulation the world has ever seen	1446	” Tracy was not hearing a word . His spirits were gone , he was desolate . “
62642	62643	62631	62640	the profoundest master of dissimulation the world has ever seen	1446	” “
62650	62677	62680	62680	I	0	” This was wrung from the unlistening Tracy by the anguished thought of what might have been if only the dinner arrangements had n’t got mixed . “
62687	62715	62830	62830	he	1453	” said Sellers , who was now placidly walking up and down the room with his hands under his coat - tails and listening to himself talk . “
62841	62862	62830	62830	he	1453	” A deep - drawn yard - long sigh from the distraught and dreaming artist , followed by a murmured , “
62869	62870	63499	63499	He	1462	” “
63032	63498	63499	63499	He	1462	” Dinner was kept waiting for a while for Miss Thompson , but as Gwendolen had not delivered the invitation to her the waiting did no good , and the household presently went to the meal without her . Poor old Sellers tried everything his hospitable soul could devise to make the occasion an enjoyable one for the guest , and the guest tried his honest best to be cheery and chatty and happy for the old gentleman ’s sake ; in fact all hands worked hard in the interest of a mutual good time , but the thing was a failure from the start ; Tracy ’s heart was lead in his bosom , there seemed to be only one prominent feature in the landscape and that was a vacant chair , he could n’t drag his mind away from Gwendolen and his hard luck ; consequently his distractions allowed deadly pauses to slip in every now and then when it was his turn to say something , and of course this disease spread to the rest of the conversation — wherefore , instead of having a breezy sail in sunny waters , as anticipated , everybody was bailing out and praying for land . What _ could _ the matter be ? Tracy alone could have told , the others could n’t even invent a theory . Meanwhile they were having a similarly dismal time at the Thompson house ; in fact a twin experience . Gwendolen was ashamed of herself for allowing her disappointment to so depress her spirits and make her so strangely and profoundly miserable ; but feeling ashamed of herself did n’t improve the matter any ; it only seemed to aggravate the suffering . She explained that she was not feeling very well , and everybody could see that this was true ; so she got sincere sympathy and commiseration ; but that did n’t help the case . Nothing helps that kind of a case . It is best to just stand off and let it fester . The moment the dinner was over the girl excused herself , and she hurried home feeling unspeakably grateful to get away from that house and that intolerable captivity and suffering . Will he be gone ? The thought arose in her brain , but took effect in her heels . She slipped into the house , threw off her things and made straight for the dining room . She stopped and listened . Her father ’s voice — with no life in it ; presently her mother’s — no life in that ; a considerable vacancy , then a sterile remark from Washington Hawkins . Another silence ; then , not Tracy ’s but her father ’s voice again . “
63503	63519	63499	63499	He	1462	” she said to herself despairingly , and listlessly opened the door and stepped within . “
63525	63530	63537	63537	you	2231	” cried the mother , “
63542	63543	63499	63499	He	1462	” “
63546	63550	63920	63920	He	1468	” exclaimed Sellers . “
63627	63919	64408	64408	she	1476	” She was content now ; and out from her happy eyes there went a light that told a secret to another pair of eyes there and got a secret in return . In just that infinitely small fraction of a second those two great confessions were made , received , and perfectly understood . All anxiety , apprehension , uncertainty , vanished out of these young people ’s hearts and left them filled with a great peace . Sellers had had the most confident faith that with the new reinforcement victory would be at this last moment snatched from the jaws of defeat , but it was an error . The talk was as stubbornly disjointed as ever . He was proud of Gwendolen , and liked to show her off , even against Miss Belle Thompson , and here had been a great opportunity , and what had she made of it ? He felt a good deal put out . It vexed him to think that this Englishman , with the traveling Briton ’s everlasting disposition to generalize whole mountain ranges from single sample - grains of sand , would jump to the conclusion that American girls were as dumb as himself — generalizing the whole tribe from this single sample and she at her poorest , there being nothing at that table to inspire her , give her a start , keep her from going to sleep . He made up his mind that for the honor of the country he would bring these two together again over the social board before long . There would be a different result another time , he judged . He said to himself , with a deep sense of injury , “
64026	64134	64248	64248	you	1475	” He shook hands all around and went off to do some work which he said was pressing . The idolaters were the width of the room apart ; and apparently unconscious of each other ’s presence . The distance got shortened a little , now . Very soon the mother withdrew . The distance narrowed again . Tracy stood before a chromo of some Ohio politician which had been retouched and chain - mailed for a crusading Rossmore , and Gwendolen was sitting on the sofa not far from his elbow artificially absorbed in examining a photograph album that had n’t any photographs in it . The “
64136	64246	64248	64248	you	1475	” still lingered . He was sorry for the young people ; it had been a dull evening for them . In the goodness of his heart he tried to make it pleasant for them now ; tried to remove the ill impression necessarily left by the general defeat ; tried to be chatty , even tried to be gay . But the responses were sickly , there was no starting any enthusiasm ; he would give it up and quit — it was a day specially picked out and consecrated to failures . But when Gwendolen rose up promptly and smiled a glad smile and said with thankfulness and blessing,—“_Must
64251	64402	64408	64408	she	1476	” it seemed cruel to desert , and he sat down again . He was about to begin a remark when — when he did n’t . We have all been there . He did n’t know how he knew his concluding to stay longer had been a mistake , he merely knew it ; and knew it for dead certain , too . And so he bade goodnight , and went mooning out , wondering what he could have done that changed the atmosphere that way . As the door closed behind him those two were standing side by side , looking at that door — looking at it in a waiting , second - counting , but deeply grateful kind of way . And the instant it closed they flung their arms about each other ’s necks , and there , heart to heart and lip to lip — “
64413	64557	64658	64659	this one	1828	” Nobody heard this remark , because Hawkins , who bred it , only thought it , he did n’t utter it . He had turned , the moment he had closed the door , and had pushed it open a little , intending to re - enter and ask what ill - advised thing he had done or said , and apologize for it . But he did n’t re - enter ; he staggered off stunned , terrified , distressed . p222.jpg ( 33 K ) CHAPTER XXII . Five minutes later he was sitting in his room , with his head bowed within the circle of his arms , on the table — final attitude of grief and despair . His tears were flowing fast , and now and then a sob broke upon the stillness . Presently he said : “
64667	64685	64857	64857	I	0	” He went on grieving to himself , and now and then giving voice to his lamentations . “
64871	64880	64974	64975	Sally Sellers	144	” After a while he broke out again : “
64984	65004	65165	65165	I	0	” He heard Sellers coming , and got himself to rights . Sellers took a seat , and said : “
65123	65164	65274	65274	I	0	” But he could n’t get Hawkins interested ; could n’t make him talk to amount to anything ; could n’t drag him out of his depression . But at last he took a turn that arrested Hawkins ’s attention . “
65295	65300	65343	65345	the old gentleman	336	“ Where he is ? ”
65301	65311	65274	65274	I	0	“ Yes — not bring him down to date . ”
65312	65329	65343	65345	the old gentleman	336	“ Oh , there ’s my hand ; and my heart ’s in it , too ! ”
65330	65341	65350	65350	he	336	“ I ’ll never forget you for this , Hawkins , ”
65357	65399	65580	65580	She	144	“ You are making a great sacrifice for me , and one which you can ill afford , but I ’ll never forget your generosity , and if I live you shall not suffer for it , be sure of that . ”
65557	65559	65580	65580	She	144	“ Lady ”
65583	65603	65633	65633	She	144	“ There — that sham belongs to the past ; I will not be called by it any more . ”
65604	65632	65695	65695	she	144	“ I may call you simply Gwendolen ? You will allow me to drop the formalities straightway and name you by your dear first name without additions ? ”
65645	65689	65728	65728	he	1512	“ There — that is better . I hate pinks — some pinks . Indeed yes , you are to call me by my first name without additions — that is,—well , I do n’t mean without additions _ entirely _ , but — ”
65732	65743	65831	65831	She	144	“ _ Dear _ Gwendolen ! I may say that ? ”
65744	65794	65831	65831	She	144	“ Yes — part of it . But — don’t kiss me when I am talking , it makes me forget what I was going to say . You can call me by part of that form , but not the last part . Gwendolen is not my name . ”
65795	65800	65831	65831	She	144	“ Not your name ? ”
65849	65873	66064	66064	she	144	“ Answer me truly , on your honor . You are not seeking to marry me on account of my _ rank ? _ ”
66095	66127	66155	66155	He	1512	“ Listen — and do not doubt me , for I shall speak the exact truth . Howard Tracy , I am no more an earl ’s child than you are ! ”
66161	66167	66200	66200	she	144	“ Thank heaven for that ! ”
66187	66199	66200	66200	she	144	“ You make me the proudest girl in all the earth , ”
66211	66295	66155	66155	He	1512	“ I thought it only natural that you should be dazzled by the title — maybe even unconsciously , you being English — and that you might be deceiving yourself in thinking you loved only me , and find you did n’t love me when the deception was swept away ; so it makes me proud that the revelation stands for nothing and that you _ do _ love just me , only me — oh , prouder than any words can tell ! ”
66296	66324	66597	66597	Tracy	179	“ It is only you , sweetheart , I never gave one envying glance toward your father ’s earldom . That is utterly true , dear Gwendolen . ”
66325	66596	66604	66604	she	1517	“ There — you must n’t call me that . I hate that false name . I told you it was n’t mine . My name is Sally Sellers — or Sarah , if you like . From this time I banish dreams , visions , imaginings , and will no more of them . I am going to be myself — my genuine self , my honest self , my natural self , clear and clean of sham and folly and fraud , and worthy of you . There is no grain of social inequality between us ; I , like you , am poor ; I , like you , am without position or distinction ; you are a struggling artist , I am that , too , in my humbler way . Our bread is honest bread , we work for our living . Hand in hand we will walk hence to the grave , helping each other in all ways , living for each other , being and remaining one in heart and purpose , one in hope and aspiration , inseparable to the end . And though our place is low , judged by the world ’s eye , we will make it as high as the highest in the great essentials of honest work for what we eat and wear , and conduct above reproach . We live in a land , let us be thankful , where this is all - sufficient , and no man is better than his neighbor by the grace of God , but only by his own merit . ”
66613	66797	66155	66155	He	1512	“ I am not through yet . I am going to purge myself of the last vestiges of artificiality and pretence , and then start fair on your own honest level and be worthy mate to you thenceforth . My father honestly thinks he is an earl . Well , leave him his dream , it pleases him and does no one any harm : It was the dream of his ancestors before him . It has made fools of the house of Sellers for generations , and it made something of a fool of me , but took no deep root . I am done with it now , and for good . Forty - eight hours ago I was privately proud of being the daughter of a pinchbeck earl , and thought the proper mate for me must be a man of like degree ; but to - day — oh , how grateful I am for your love which has healed my sick brain and restored my sanity!—I could make oath that no earl ’s son in all the world — ”
66798	66805	66604	66604	she	1517	“ Oh,—well , but — but — ”
66806	66827	66604	66604	she	1517	“ Why , you look like a person in a panic . What is it ? What is the matter ? ”
66828	66842	66862	66862	he	1519	“ Matter ? Oh , nothing — nothing . I was only going to say”—but
66880	66899	67143	67143	He	179	“ Oh , how beautiful you are ! You take my breath away when you look like that . ”
66918	67049	67143	67143	He	179	“ Let me see . Where was I ? Yes , my father ’s earldom is pure moonshine . Look at those dreadful things on the wall . You have of course supposed them to be portraits of his ancestors , earls of Rossmore . Well , they are not . They are chromos of distinguished Americans — all moderns ; but he has carried them back a thousand years by re - labeling them . Andrew Jackson there , is doing what he can to be the late American earl ; and the newest treasure in the collection is supposed to be the young English heir — I mean the idiot with the crape ; but in truth it ’s a shoemaker , and not Lord Berkeley at all . ”
67050	67055	67143	67143	He	179	“ Are you sure ? ”
67056	67070	67143	67143	He	179	“ Why of course I am . He would n’t look like that . ”
67071	67074	67143	67143	He	179	“ Why ? ”
67075	67112	67143	67143	He	179	“ Because his conduct in his last moments , when the fire was sweeping around him shows that he was a man . It shows that he was a fine , high - souled young creature . ”
67148	67178	67206	67206	Tracy	179	“ It is a pity he could not know what a gracious impression his behavior was going to leave with the dearest and sweetest stranger in the land of — ”
67179	67205	67227	67227	He	179	“ Oh , I almost loved him ! Why , I think of him every day . He is always floating about in my mind . ”
67230	67265	67227	67227	He	179	“ It is quite right to think of him — at least now and then — that is , at intervals — in perhaps an admiring way — but it seems to me that — ”
67266	67278	67401	67401	she	144	“ Howard Tracy , are you jealous of that dead man ? ”
67414	67452	67502	67502	He	179	“ And in order to make sure that he shall never make trouble between us again , I will teach myself to detest that name and all that have ever borne it or ever shall bear it . ”
67517	67541	67502	67502	He	179	“ I suppose you disapprove wholly of aristocracies and nobilities , now that you have renounced your title and your father ’s earldom . ”
67542	67564	67781	67783	The shady devil	1531	“ _ Real _ ones ? Oh , dear no — but I ’ve thrown aside our sham one for good . ”
67755	67780	69495	69495	She	144	“ That question had a harmless look , but what was _ back _ of it?—what was the secret motive of it?—what suggested it ? ”
69463	69494	69497	69497	herself	144	“ Oh , my darling , what have I done — what have I said ? It has happened again ! What _ have _ I done to wound you ? ”
69510	69577	69459	69459	Sally	144	“ What have you done ? I will tell you what you have done . You have unwittingly revealed — oh , for the twentieth time , though I _ could _ not believe it , _ would _ not believe it!—that it is not me you love , but that foolish sham , my father ’s imitation earldom ; and you have broken my heart ! ”
69578	69597	69459	69459	Sally	144	“ Oh , my child , what are you saying ! I never dreamed of such a thing . ”
69598	69623	69497	69497	herself	144	“ Oh , Howard , Howard , the things you have uttered when you were forgetting to guard your tongue , have betrayed you . ”
69624	69677	69459	69459	Sally	144	“ Things I have uttered when I was _ forgetting _ to guard my tongue ? These are hard words . When have I _ remembered _ to guard it ? Never in one instance . It has no office but to speak the truth . It needs no guarding for that . ”
69678	69711	69459	69459	Sally	144	“ Howard , I have noted your words and weighed them , when you were not thinking of their significance — and they have told me more than you meant they should . ”
69712	69777	69822	69822	she	953	“ Do you mean to say you have answered the trust I had in you by using it as an ambuscade from which you could set snares for my unsuspecting tongue and be safe from detection while you did it ? You have not done this — surely you have not done this thing . Oh , one ’s enemy could not do it . ”
69815	69821	69822	69822	she	953	“ Oh , forgive me , ”
69825	69994	70100	70100	he	1573	“ I did not know what I was doing . I have been so tortured — you _ will _ forgive me , you _ must ; _ I have suffered so much , and I am so sorry and so humble ; you _ do _ forgive me , _ do n’t _ you?—don’t turn away , do n’t refuse me ; it is only my love that is at fault , and you _ know _ I love you , love you with all my heart ; I could n’t bear to — oh , dear , dear , I am so miserable , and I _ never _ meant any harm , and I did n’t see where this insanity was carrying me , and how it was wronging and abusing the dearest heart in all the world to me — and — and — oh , take me in your arms again , I have no other refuge , no other home and hope ! ”
70103	70151	70178	70178	she	953	“ Let me whisper a little secret in your ear — a secret which I have kept shut up in my breast all this time . Your rank _ could n’t _ ever have been an enticement . I am son and heir to an English earl ! ”
70174	70177	70178	70178	she	953	“ You ? ”
70198	70222	70170	70170	her	953	“ Why — why , certainly I am . Why do you act like this ? What have I done _ now ? _ ”
70223	70244	70170	70170	her	953	“ What have you done ? You have certainly made a most strange statement . You must see that yourself . ”
70245	70248	70170	70170	her	953	“ Well , ”
70255	70276	70170	70170	her	953	“ it may be a strange enough statement ; but of what consequence is that , if it is true ? ”
70277	70292	70326	70326	Her	953	“ _ If _ it is true . You are already retiring from it . ”
70293	70325	70326	70326	Her	953	“ Oh , not for a moment ! You should not say that . I have not deserved it . I have spoken the truth ; why do you doubt it ? ”
70331	70341	70170	70170	her	953	“ Simply because you did n’t speak it earlier ! ”
70342	70345	70365	70365	he	1573	“ Oh ! ”
70378	70429	70457	70457	She	953	“ You have seemed to conceal nothing from me that I ought to know concerning yourself , and you were not privileged to keep back such a thing as this from me a moment after — after — well , after you had determined to pay your court to me . ”
70430	70456	70470	70470	he	1573	“ Its true , it ’s true , I know it ! But there were circumstances — in — in the way — circumstances which — ”
70463	70469	70470	70470	he	1573	“ Well , you see , ”
70475	70519	70559	70559	He	1573	“ you seemed so bent on our traveling the proud path of honest labor and honorable poverty , that I was terrified — that is , I was afraid — of — of — well , _ you _ know how you talked . ”
70520	70558	70566	70566	he	1573	“ Yes , I know how I talked . And I also know that before the talk was finished you inquired how I stood as regards aristocracies , and my answer was calculated to relieve your fears . ”
70574	70637	70649	70649	she	953	“ I do n’t see any way out of it . It was a mistake . That is in truth all it was , just a mistake . No harm was meant , no harm in the world . I did n’t see how it might some time look . It is my way . I do n’t seem to see far . ”
70654	70676	70566	70566	he	1573	“ An Earl ’s son ! Do earls ’ sons go about working in lowly callings for their bread and butter ? ”
70677	70690	70649	70649	she	953	“ God knows they do n’t ! I have wished they did . ”
70691	70761	70821	70821	She	1577	“ Do earls ’ sons sink their degree in a country like this , and come sober and decent to sue for the hand of a born child of poverty when they can go drunk , profane , and steeped in dishonorable debt and buy the pick and choice of the millionaires ’ daughters of America ? _ You _ an earl ’s son ! Show me the signs . ”
70767	70820	70843	70843	she	1577	“ I thank God I am not able — if those are the signs . But yet I am an earl ’s son and heir . It is all I can say . I wish you would believe me , but you will not . I know no way to persuade you . ”
70847	70925	70926	70926	He	1578	“ Oh , you drive all patience out of me ! Would you have one believe that you have n’t your proofs at hand , and yet are what you say you are ? You do not put your hand in your pocket _ now_—for you have nothing there . You make a claim like this , and then venture to travel without credentials . These are simply incredibilities . Do n’t you see that , yourself ? ”
70954	71074	71150	71150	Tracy	179	“ I will tell you just the truth , foolish as it will seem to you — to anybody , I suppose — but it _ is _ the truth . I had an ideal — call it a dream , a folly , if you will — but I wanted to renounce the privileges and unfair advantages enjoyed by the nobility and wrung from the nation by force and fraud , and purge myself of my share of those crimes against right and reason , by thenceforth comrading with the poor and humble on equal terms , earning with my own hands the bread I ate , and rising by my own merit if I rose at all . ”
71168	71196	71158	71158	he	179	“ An earl ’s son to do that ! Why , he were a man ! A man to love!—oh , more , a man to worship ! ”
71197	71203	71158	71158	he	179	“ Why , I — ? ”
71204	71292	71150	71150	Tracy	179	“ But he never lived ! He is not born , he will not be born . The self - abnegation that could do that — even in utter folly , and hopeless of conveying benefit to any , beyond the mere example — could be mistaken for greatness ; why , it would _ be _ greatness in this cold age of sordid ideals ! A moment — wait — let me finish ; I have one question more . Your father is earl of what ? ”
71293	71302	71311	71312	The girl	953	“ Rossmore — and I am Viscount Berkeley ! ”
71325	71392	71158	71158	he	179	“ How _ can _ you venture such a brazen thing ! You know that he is dead , and you know that I know it . Oh , to rob the living of name and honors for a selfish and temporary advantage is crime enough , but to rob the defenceless dead — why it is more than crime , it _ degrades _ crime ! ”
71393	71428	71158	71158	he	179	“ Oh , listen to me — just a word — don’t turn away like that . Do n’t go — don’t leave me , so — stay one moment . On my honor — ”
71429	71436	71158	71158	he	179	“ Oh , on your honor ! ”
71437	71473	71158	71158	he	179	“ On my honor I am what I say ! And I will prove it , and you will believe , I know you will . I will bring you a message — a cablegram — ”
71474	71477	71158	71158	he	179	“ When ? ”
71478	71486	71158	71158	he	179	“ To - morrow — next day — ”
71487	71493	71158	71158	he	179	“ Signed ‘ Rossmore ’ ? ”
71494	71500	71158	71158	he	179	“ Yes — signed Rossmore . ”
71501	71507	71158	71158	he	179	“ What will that prove ? ”
71508	71521	71158	71158	he	179	“ What will it prove ? What _ should _ it prove ? ”
71522	71539	71550	71550	He	1582	“ If you force me to say it — possibly the presence of a confederate somewhere . ”
71555	71613	71636	71636	she	1582	“ It is true . I did not think of it . Oh , my God , I do not know any way to do ; I do everything wrong . You are going?—and you wo n’t say even good - night — or good - bye ? Ah , we have not parted like this before . ”
71614	71631	71636	71636	she	1582	“ Oh , I _ want _ to run and — no , go , now . ”
71639	71649	71661	71661	He	1582	“ You may bring the message when it comes . ”
71650	71660	71685	71685	her	1582	“ Oh , may I ? God bless you . ”
71693	71821	71825	71825	she	1583	“ Oh , he is gone . I have lost him , I shall never see him any more . And he did n’t kiss me good - bye ; never even offered to force a kiss from me , and he _ knowing _ it was the very , very last , and I expecting he would , and never _ dreaming _ he would treat me so after all we have been to each other . Oh , oh , oh , oh , what shall I do , what _ shall _ I do ! He is a dear , poor , miserable , good - hearted , transparent liar and humbug , but oh , I _ do _ love him so — ! ”
71831	71983	72716	72716	He	114	“ How dear he is ! and I shall miss him so , I shall miss him so ! Why _ wo n’t _ he ever think to _ forge _ a message and fetch it?—but no , he never will , he never thinks of anything ; he ’s so honest and simple it would n’t ever occur to him . Oh , what _ did _ possess him to think he could succeed as a fraud — and he has n’t the first requisite except duplicity that I can see . Oh , dear , I ’ll go to bed and give it all up . Oh , I _ wish _ I had told him to come and tell me whenever he did n’t get any telegram — and now it ’s all my own fault if I never see him again . How my eyes must look ! ”
72719	72835	73173	73173	He	336	“ That ’s just the way things go . A man invents a thing which could revolutionize the arts , produce mountains of money , and bless the earth , and who will bother with it or show any interest in it?—and so you are just as poor as you were before . But you invent some worthless thing to amuse yourself with , and would throw it away if let alone , and all of a sudden the whole world makes a snatch for it and out crops a fortune . Hunt up that Yankee and collect , Hawkins — half is yours , you know . Leave me to potter at my lecture . ”
73181	73183	73211	73211	he	336	“ fixed ”
73222	73359	73379	73380	the mother	2008	“ Do n’t cry , my child , do n’t cry so ; _ you _ know your old father did it by mistake and did n’t mean a bit of harm ; you know he would n’t intentionally do anything to make you ashamed for the world ; you know he was trying to do good and only made the mistake through ignorance , not knowing the right doses and Washington not there to help . Do n’t cry so , dear , it breaks my old heart to see you , and think I ’ve brought this humiliation on you and you so dear to me and so good . I wo n’t ever do it again , indeed I wo n’t ; now be comforted , honey , that ’s a good child . ”
73390	73529	73568	73568	herself	144	“ Do n’t cry , dear , _ he _ never meant any harm ; it was all one of those happens that you ca n’t guard against when you are trying experiments , that way . You see _ I _ do n’t cry . It ’s because I know him so well . I could never look anybody in the face again if he had got into such an amazing condition as that a - purpose ; but bless you his intention was pure and high , and that makes the _ act _ pure , though it was higher than was necessary . We ’re not humiliated , dear , he did it under a noble impulse and we do n’t need to be ashamed . There , do n’t cry any more , honey . ”
73570	73637	73665	73665	he	336	“ It ’s a shame to let him see in my crying a reproach — as if he could ever do anything that could make me reproach him ! But I ca n’t confess ; I ’ve got to go on using him for a pretext , he ’s the only one I ’ve got in the world , and I do need one so much . ”
73668	73700	73888	73888	She	144	“ _ Now _ we ’ll soon see who ’s the Claimant and who ’s the Authentic . I ’ll just go over there and warm up that House of Lords . ”
73895	73989	74040	74040	he	1641	“ _ Do n’t _ tell me he is an impostor . I suppose he is , but does n’t it look to you as if he is n’t ? You are cool , you know , and outside ; and so , maybe it can look to you as if he is n’t one , when it ca n’t to me . _ Does n’t _ it look to you as if he is n’t ? Could n’t you—_can’t _ it look to you that way — for — for my sake ? ”
74036	74039	74040	74040	he	1641	“ No , ”
74043	74053	74040	74040	he	1641	“ the truth is , he ’s an impostor . ”
74054	74080	74040	74040	he	1641	“ That is , you — you feel a little certain , but not entirely — oh , not _ entirely _ , Mr. Hawkins ! ”
74081	74115	74040	74040	he	1641	“ It ’s a pity to have to say it — I do hate to say it , but I do n’t think anything about it , I know he ’s an impostor . ”
74116	74162	74194	74194	he	1641	“ Oh , now , Mr. Hawkins , you _ ca n’t _ go that far . A body _ ca n’t _ really know it , you know . It is n’t _ proved _ that he ’s not what he says he is . ”
74224	74276	74284	74284	she	953	“ Now I am going to tell you a plain tale ; one not pleasant for me to tell or for you to hear , but we ’ve got to stand it . I know all about that fellow ; and I _ know _ he is no earl ’s son . ”
74287	74300	74325	74325	He	250	“ I do n’t care a snap for that — go on ! ”
74328	74364	74284	74284	she	953	“ I do n’t know that I quite understand . Do you mean to say that if he was all right and proper otherwise you ’d be indifferent about the earl part of the business ? ”
74365	74368	74284	74284	she	953	“ Absolutely . ”
74369	74406	74325	74325	He	250	“ You ’d be entirely satisfied with him and would n’t _ care _ for his not being an earl ’s son,—that _ being _ an earl ’s son would n’t add any value to him ? ”
74407	74515	74524	74524	He	1645	“ Not the least value that I would care for . Why , Mr. Hawkins , I ’ve gotten over all that day - dreaming about earldoms and aristocracies and all such nonsense and am become just a plain ordinary nobody and content with it ; and it is to _ him _ I owe my cure . And as to anything being able to add a value to him , nothing can do that . He is the whole world to me , just as he is ; he comprehends _ all _ the values there are — then how can you _ add _ one ? ”
74516	74523	74530	74530	He	1645	“ She ’s pretty far gone . ”
74537	74626	74628	74628	he	1645	“ I must change my plan again ; I ca n’t seem to strike one that will stand the requirements of this most variegated emergency five minutes on a stretch . Without making this fellow a criminal , I believe I will invent a name and a character for him calculated to disenchant her . If it fails to do it , then I ’ll know that the next rightest thing to do will be to help her to her fate , poor thing , not hinder her . ”
74632	74637	74530	74530	He	1645	“ Well , Gwendolen — ”
74638	74646	74530	74530	He	1645	“ I want to be called Sally . ”
74647	74674	74530	74530	He	1645	“ I ’m glad of it ; I like it better , myself . Well , then , I ’ll tell you about this man Snodgrass . ”
74675	74685	74530	74530	He	1645	“ Snodgrass ! Is _ that _ his name ? ”
74686	74699	74530	74530	He	1645	“ Yes — Snodgrass . The other ’s his nom de plume . ”
74700	74705	74530	74530	He	1645	“ It ’s hideous ! ”
74706	74720	74736	74736	Hawkins	250	“ I know it is , but we ca n’t help our names . ”
74721	74735	74736	74736	Hawkins	250	“ And that is truly his real name — and not Howard Tracy ? ”
74741	74749	74750	74751	The girl	953	“ Yes , it seems a pity . ”
74761	74799	74530	74530	He	1645	“ Snodgrass . Snodgrass . No , I could not endure that . I could not get used to it . No , I should call him by his first name . What is his first name ? ”
74800	74810	74959	74959	she	1647	“ His — er — his initials are S. M. ”
74811	74841	74959	74959	she	1647	“ His initials ? I do n’t care anything about his initials . I ca n’t call him by his initials . What do they _ stand _ for ? ”
74842	74882	74750	74751	The girl	953	“ Well , you see , his father was a physician , and he — he — well he was an idolater of his profession , and he — well , he was a very eccentric man , and — ”
74883	74898	74959	74959	she	1647	“ What do they _ stand _ for ! What are you shuffling about ? ”
74899	74915	74959	74959	she	1647	“ They — well they stand for Spinal Meningitis . His father being a phy — ”
74916	74954	74959	74959	she	1647	“ I never heard such an infamous name ! Nobody can ever call a person _ that_—a person they love . I would n’t call an enemy by such a name . It sounds like an epithet . ”
74967	74985	74959	74959	she	1647	“ Why , it would be _ my _ name ! Letters would come with it on . ”
74986	74994	74959	74959	she	1647	“ Yes — Mrs. Spinal Meningitis Snodgrass . ”
74995	75015	74959	74959	she	1647	“ Do n’t repeat it — don’t ; I ca n’t bear it . Was the father a lunatic ? ”
75016	75024	74959	74959	she	1647	“ No , that is not charged . ”
75025	75051	74959	74959	she	1647	“ I am glad of that , because that is transmissible . What do you think _ was _ the matter with him , then ? ”
75052	75077	74959	74959	she	1647	“ Well , I do n’t really know . The family used to run a good deal to idiots , and so , maybe — ”
75078	75095	74959	74959	she	1647	“ Oh , there is n’t any maybe about it . This one was an idiot . ”
75096	75110	75116	75116	Sally	144	“ Well , yes — he could have been . He was suspected . ”
75111	75114	75116	75116	Sally	144	“ Suspected ! ”
75121	75169	74959	74959	she	1647	“ Would one _ suspect _ there was going to be a dark time if he saw the constellations fall out of the sky ? But that is enough about the idiot , I do n’t take any interest in idiots ; tell me about the son . ”
75170	75192	74959	74959	she	1647	“ Very well , then , this one was the eldest , but not the favorite . His brother , Zylobalsamum — ”
75193	75217	74959	74959	she	1647	“ Wait — give me a chance to realize that . It is perfectly stupefying . Zylo — what did you call it ? ”
75218	75221	74959	74959	she	1647	“ Zylobalsamum . ”
75222	75241	74959	74959	she	1647	“ I never heard such a name : It sounds like a disease . Is it a disease ? ”
75242	75260	74959	74959	she	1647	“ No , I do n’t think it ’s a disease . It ’s either Scriptural or — ”
75261	75269	74959	74959	she	1647	“ Well , it ’s not Scriptural . ”
75270	75316	74959	74959	she	1647	“ Then it ’s anatomical . I knew it was one or the other . Yes , I remember , now , it _ is _ anatomical . It ’s a ganglion — a nerve centre — it is what is called the zylobalsamum process . ”
75317	75344	74959	74959	she	1647	“ Well , go on ; and if you come to any more of them , omit the names ; they make one feel so uncomfortable . ”
75345	75410	74959	74959	she	1647	“ Very well , then . As I said , this one was not a favorite in the family , and so he was neglected in every way , never sent to school , always allowed to associate with the worst and coarsest characters , and so of course he has grown up a rude , vulgar , ignorant , dissipated ruffian , and — ”
75411	75482	74959	74959	she	1647	“ He ? It ’s no such thing ! You ought to be more generous than to make such a statement as that about a poor young stranger who — who — why , he is the very opposite of that ! He is considerate , courteous , obliging , modest , gentle , refined , cultivated—_oh _ , for shame ! how can you say such things about him ? ”
75483	75523	74959	74959	she	1647	“ I do n’t blame you , Sally — indeed I have n’t a word of blame for you for being blinded by — your affection — blinded to these minor defects which are so manifest to others who — ”
75524	75543	74959	74959	she	1647	“ Minor defects ? Do you call these minor defects ? What are murder and arson , pray ? ”
75544	75593	74959	74959	she	1647	“ It is a difficult question to answer straight off — and of course estimates of such things vary with environment . With us , out our way , they would not necessarily attract as much attention as with you , yet they are often regarded with disapproval — ”
75594	75603	74959	74959	she	1647	“ Murder and arson are regarded with disapproval ? ”
75604	75609	74959	74959	she	1647	“ Oh , frequently . ”
75610	75649	74959	74959	she	1647	“ With disapproval . Who _ are _ those Puritans you are talking about ? But wait — how did you come to know so much about this family ? Where did you get all this hearsay evidence ? ”
75650	75676	74959	74959	she	1647	“ Sally , it is n’t hearsay evidence . That is the serious part of it . I _ knew _ that family — personally . ”
75682	75690	74959	74959	she	1647	“ You ? You actually knew them ? ”
75691	75752	74959	74959	she	1647	“ Knew Zylo , as we used to call him , and knew his father , Dr. Snodgrass . I did n’t know your own Snodgrass , but have had glimpses of him from time to time , and I heard about him all the time . He was the common talk , you see , on account of his — ”
75753	75785	74959	74959	she	1647	“ On account of his not being a house - burner or an assassin , I suppose . That would have made him commonplace . Where did you know these people ? ”
75786	75791	74959	74959	she	1647	“ In Cherokee Strip . ”
75792	75839	75840	75840	Hawkins	250	“ Oh , how preposterous ! There are not enough people in Cherokee Strip to _ give _ anybody a reputation , good or bad . There is n’t a quorum . Why the whole population consists of a couple of wagon loads of horse thieves . ”
75844	75854	76000	76000	Sally	254	“ Our friend was one of those wagon loads . ”
76003	76161	76000	76000	Sally	254	“ He has no friend but me , and I will not desert him now . I will not marry him if his moral character is bad ; but if he can prove that it is n’t , I will — and he shall have the chance . To me he seems utterly good and dear ; I ’ve never seen anything about him that looked otherwise — except , of course , his calling himself an earl ’s son . Maybe that is only vanity , and no real harm , when you get to the bottom of it . I do _ not _ believe he is any such person as you have painted him . I want to see him . I want you to find him and send him to me . I will implore him to be honest with me , and tell me the whole truth , and not be afraid . ”
76162	76188	76318	76318	Sally	254	“ Very well ; if that is your decision I will do it . But Sally , you know , he ’s poor , and — ”
76189	76216	76000	76000	Sally	254	“ Oh , _ I _ do n’t care anything about that . That ’s neither here nor there . Will you bring him to me ? ”
76217	76226	76000	76000	Sally	254	“ I ’ll do it . When ? — ”
76227	76271	76318	76318	Sally	254	“ Oh , dear , it ’s getting toward dark , now , and so you ’ll have to put it off till morning . But you _ will _ find him in the morning , _ wo n’t _ you ? Promise . ”
76272	76281	76000	76000	Sally	254	“ I ’ll have him here by daylight . ”
76282	76301	76318	76318	Sally	254	“ Oh , _ now _ you ’re your own old self again — and lovelier than ever ! ”
76302	76317	76318	76318	Sally	254	“ I could n’t ask fairer than that . Good - bye , dear . ”
76328	76340	76366	76366	He	250	“ I love him in _ spite _ of his name ! ”
76371	76414	76416	76416	he	250	“ She ’s not going to give this galvanized cadaver up , that ’s plain . Wild horses ca n’t pull her away from him . I ’ve done my share ; it ’s for Sellers to take an innings , now . ”
76424	76442	76475	76475	Sally	144	“ _ Come back . Hire special train . She ’s going to marry the materializee _ . ”
76480	76624	76876	76876	she	144	“ It is a pity he did n’t stop in New York ; but it ’s no matter ; he can go up to - morrow and see my father . He has come over here to tomahawk papa , very likely — or buy out his claim . This thing would have excited me , a while back ; but it has only one interest for me now , and only one value . I can say to — to — Spine , Spiny , Spinal — I do n’t like any _ form _ of that name!—I can say to him to - morrow , ‘ _ Do n’t _ try to keep it up any more , or I shall have to tell you whom I have been talking with last night , and then you will be embarrassed . ’ ”
76891	76968	76997	76997	she	144	“ It ’s so lonesome — with papa and mamma gone . I try to read , but I ca n’t seem to get interested in any book . I try the newspapers , but they do put such rubbish in them . You take up a paper and start to read something you thinks interesting , and it goes on and on and on about how somebody — well , Dr. Snodgrass , for instance — ”
77010	77013	76997	76997	she	144	“ Well ? ”
77014	77052	77092	77092	she	144	“ Oh , I thought you were not listening . Yes , it goes on and on about this Doctor Snodgrass , till you are so tired , and then about his younger son—_the favorite son_—Zylobalsamum Snodgrass — ”
77117	77184	77222	77222	she	144	“ And next it goes on and on and on about the eldest son—_not _ the favorite , this one — and how he is neglected in his poor barren boyhood , and allowed to grow up unschooled , ignorant , coarse , vulgar , the comrade of the community ’s scum , and become in his completed manhood a rude , profane , dissipated ruffian — ”
77228	77235	77244	77245	The girl	953	“ — named Spinal Meningitis Snodgrass ! ”
77259	77268	77222	77222	she	144	“ What _ are _ you made of ? ”
77269	77274	77222	77222	she	144	“ I ? Why ? ”
77275	77300	77307	77307	he	179	“ Have n’t you _ any _ sensitiveness ? Do n’t these things touch any poor _ remnant _ of delicate feeling in you ? ”
77301	77306	77307	77307	he	179	“ N — no , ”
77311	77322	77222	77222	she	144	“ they do n’t seem to . Why should they ? ”
77323	77400	77222	77222	she	144	“ O , dear me , _ how _ can you look so innocent , and foolish , and good , and empty , and gentle , and all that , right in the hearing of such things as those ! Look me in the eye — straight in the eye . There , now then , answer me without a flinch . Is n’t Doctor Snodgrass your father , and is n’t Zylobalsamum your brother , ”
77435	77521	77222	77222	she	144	“ and is n’t your name Spinal Meningitis , and is n’t your father a doctor and an idiot , like all the family for generations , and does n’t he name all his children after poisons and pestilences and abnormal anatomical eccentricities of the human body ? Answer me , some way or somehow — and quick . _ Why _ do you sit there looking like an envelope without any address on it and see me going mad before your face with suspense ! ”
77522	77576	77222	77222	she	144	“ Oh , I wish I could do — do — I wish I could do something , _ anything _ that would give you peace again and make you happy ; but I know of nothing — I know of no way . I have never heard of these awful people before . ”
77577	77584	77222	77222	she	144	“ What ? Say it again ! ”
77585	77597	77222	77222	she	144	“ I have never — never in my life till now . ”
77598	77646	77222	77222	she	144	“ Oh , you _ do _ look so honest when you say that ! It _ must _ be true — surely you _ could n’t _ look that way , you _ would n’t _ look that way if it were not true—_would _ you ? ”
77647	77678	77222	77222	she	144	“ I could n’t and would n’t . It _ is _ true . Oh , let us end this suffering — take me back into your heart and confidence — ”
77679	77718	77222	77222	she	144	“ Wait — one more thing . Tell me you told that falsehood out of mere vanity and are sorry for it ; that you ’re _ not _ expecting to ever wear the coronet of an earl — ”
77719	77736	77222	77222	she	144	“ Truly I am cured — cured this very day — I am not expecting it ! ”
77737	77782	77222	77222	she	144	“ O , now you _ are _ mine ! I ’ve got you back in the beauty and glory of your unsmirched poverty and your honorable obscurity , and nobody shall ever take you from me again but the grave ! And if — ”
77783	77793	77799	77801	The young man	2128	“ De earl of Rossmore , fum Englan ’ ! ”
77794	77798	77865	77865	he	336	“ My father ! ”
77871	77883	77909	77909	Sally	144	“ Do n’t you think you could embrace me , too ? ”
77892	77907	77909	77909	Sally	144	“ Then you _ are _ the son of an earl , after all , ”
77913	77918	77865	77865	he	336	“ Yes , I — ”
77919	77927	77909	77909	Sally	144	“ Then I wo n’t have you ! ”
77928	77935	77909	77909	Sally	144	“ O , but you know — ”
77936	77950	77865	77865	he	336	“ No , I will not . You ’ve told me another fib . ”
77951	77969	78016	78017	the former	1674	“ She ’s right . Go away and leave us . I want to talk with her . ”
78020	78071	78016	78017	the former	1674	“ I came all the way over here to inspect you , my dear , with the general idea of breaking off this match if there were _ two _ fools of you , but as there ’s only one , you can have him if you ’ll take him . ”
78072	78084	78104	78105	Meantime Hawkins	257	“ Indeed I will , then ! May I kiss you ? ”
78085	78103	78161	78161	Hawkins	257	“ You may . Thank you . Now you shall have that privilege whenever you are good . ”
78144	78160	78165	78165	He	257	“ And I ’m his son , Viscount Berkeley , not Howard Tracy any more . ”
78168	78177	78161	78161	Hawkins	257	“ Good gracious , then you ’re dead ! ”
78178	78181	78161	78161	Hawkins	257	“ Dead ? ”
78182	78192	78165	78165	He	257	“ Yes you are — we’ve got your ashes . ”
78193	78212	78252	78252	he	1640	“ Hang those ashes , I ’m tired of them ; I ’ll give them to my father . ”
78257	78294	78302	78302	Berkeley	102	“ I ’m so glad ; so glad on Sally ’s account , poor thing . We took you for a departed materialized bank thief from Tahlequah . This will be a heavy blow to Sellers . ”
78307	78332	78252	78252	he	1640	“ Well , the Claimant must manage to stand the blow , severe as it is . But he ’ll get over the disappointment . ”
78333	78388	78252	78252	he	1640	“ Who — the colonel ? He ’ll get over it the minute he invents a new miracle to take its place . And he ’s already at it by this time . But look here — what do you suppose became of the man you ’ve been _ representing _ all this time ? ”
78389	78415	78252	78252	he	1640	“ I do n’t know . I saved his clothes — it was all I could do . I am afraid he lost his life . ”
78416	78439	78252	78252	he	1640	“ Well , you must have found twenty or thirty thousand dollars in those clothes , in money or certificates of deposit . ”
78440	78462	78252	78252	he	1640	“ No , I found only five hundred and a trifle . I borrowed the trifle and banked the five hundred . ”
78463	78471	78252	78252	he	1640	“ What ’ll we do about it ? ”
78472	78479	78252	78252	he	1640	“ Return it to the owner . ”
78480	78562	78252	78252	he	1640	“ It ’s easy said , but not easy to manage . Let ’s leave it alone till we get Sellers ’s advice . And that reminds me . I ’ve got to run and meet Sellers and explain who you are _ not _ and who you _ are _ , or he ’ll come thundering in here to stop his daughter from marrying a phantom . But — suppose your father came over here to break off the match ? ”
78563	78581	79975	79975	you	1709	“ Well , is n’t he down stairs getting acquainted with Sally ? That ’s all safe . ”
