8015	8419	8420	8420	Chambers	95	" The new negroes gave Roxy no trouble , of course . The master gave her none , for one of his speculations was in jeopardy , and his mind was so occupied that he hardly saw the children when he looked at them , and all Roxy had to do was to get them both into a gale of laughter when he came about ; then their faces were mainly cavities exposing gums , and he was gone again before the spasm passed and the little creatures resumed a human aspect . Within a few days the fate of the speculation became so dubious that Mr. Percy went away with his brother the Judge , to see what could be done with it . It was a land speculation as usual , and it had gotten complicated with a lawsuit . The men were gone seven weeks . Before they got back Roxy had paid her visit to Wilson , and was satisfied . Wilson took the finger - prints , labeled them with the names and with the date -- October the first -- put them carefully away and continued his chat with Roxy , who seemed very anxious that he should admire the great advance in flesh and beauty which the babies had made since he took their finger - prints a month before . He complimented their improvement to her contentment ; and as they were without any disguise of jam or other stain , she trembled all the while and was miserably frightened lest at any moment he-- But he did n't . He discovered nothing ; and she went home jubilant , and dropped all concern about the matter permanently out of her mind . CHAPTER IV . The Ways of the Changelings .

8502	8791	8420	8420	Chambers	95	breath"--that frightful specialty of the teething nursling , in the throes of which the creature exhausts its lungs , then is convulsed with noiseless squirmings and twistings and kickings in the effort to get its breath , while the lips turn blue and the mouth stands wide and rigid , offering for inspection one wee tooth set in the lower rim of a hoop of red gums ; and when the appalling stillness has endured until one is sure the lost breath will never return , a nurse comes flying , and dashes water in the child 's face , and -- presto ! the lungs fill , and instantly discharge a shriek , or a yell , or a howl which bursts the listening ear and surprises the owner of it into saying words which would not go well with a halo if he had one . The baby Tom would claw anybody who came within reach of his nails , and pound anybody he could reach with his rattle . He would scream for water until he got it , and then throw cup and all on the floor and scream for more . He was indulged in all his caprices , howsoever troublesome and exasperating they might be ; he was allowed to eat anything he wanted , particularly things that would give him the stomach - ache . When he got to be old enough to begin to toddle about and say broken words and get an idea of what his hands were for , he was a more consummate pest than ever . Roxy got no rest while he was awake . He would call for anything and everything he saw , simply saying "
8795	8825	8420	8420	Chambers	95	" ( want it ) , which was a command . When it was brought , he said in a frenzy , and motioning it away with his hands , "
8836	8849	8420	8420	Chambers	95	" and the moment it was gone he set up frantic yells of "
8859	8909	8420	8420	Chambers	95	" and Roxy had to give wings to her heels to get that thing back to him again before he could get time to carry out his intention of going into convulsions about it . What he preferred above all other things was the tongs . This was because his "
8911	8945	8420	8420	Chambers	95	" had forbidden him to have them lest he break windows and furniture with them . The moment Roxy 's back was turned he would toddle to the presence of the tongs and say "
8949	8966	8420	8420	Chambers	95	" and cock his eye to one side to see if Roxy was observing ; then , "
8970	8979	8420	8420	Chambers	95	" and cock his eye again ; then , "
8983	8992	8420	8420	Chambers	95	" with another furtive glance ; and finally , "
8994	9090	8420	8420	Chambers	95	it!"--and the prize was his . The next moment the heavy implement was raised aloft ; the next , there was a crash and a squall , and the cat was off on three legs to meet an engagement ; Roxy would arrive just as the lamp or a window went to irremediable smash . Tom got all the petting , Chambers got none . Tom got all the delicacies , Chambers got mush and milk , and clabber without sugar . In consequence Tom was a sickly child and Chambers was n't . Tom was "
9093	9418	8420	8420	Chambers	95	" as Roxy called it , and overbearing ; Chambers was meek and docile . With all her splendid common sense and practical every - day ability , Roxy was a doting fool of a mother . She was this toward her child -- and she was also more than this : by the fiction created by herself , he was become her master ; the necessity of recognizing this relation outwardly and of perfecting herself in the forms required to express the recognition , had moved her to such diligence and faithfulness in practicing these forms that this exercise soon concreted itself into habit ; it became automatic and unconscious ; then a natural result followed : deceptions intended solely for others gradually grew practically into self - deceptions as well ; the mock reverence became real reverence , the mock obsequiousness real obsequiousness , the mock homage real homage ; the little counterfeit rift of separation between imitation - slave and imitation - master widened and widened , and became an abyss , and a very real one -- and on one side of it stood Roxy , the dupe of her own deceptions , and on the other stood her child , no longer a usurper to her , but her accepted and recognized master . He was her darling , her master , and her deity all in one , and in her worship of him she forgot who she was and what he had been . In babyhood Tom cuffed and banged and scratched Chambers unrebuked , and Chambers early learned that between meekly bearing it and resenting it , the advantage all lay with the former policy . The few times that his persecutions had moved him beyond control and made him fight back had cost him very dear at headquarters ; not at the hands of Roxy , for if she ever went beyond scolding him sharply for "
9427	9625	8420	8420	Chambers	95	" she at least never extended her punishment beyond a box on the ear . No , Percy Driscoll was the person . He told Chambers that under no provocation whatever was he privileged to lift his hand against his little master . Chambers overstepped the line three times , and got three such convincing canings from the man who was his father and did n't know it , that he took Tom 's cruelties in all humility after that , and made no more experiments . Outside of the house the two boys were together all through their boyhood . Chambers was strong beyond his years , and a good fighter ; strong because he was coarsely fed and hard worked about the house , and a good fighter because Tom furnished him plenty of practice -- on white boys whom he hated and was afraid of . Chambers was his constant body - guard , to and from school ; he was present on the playground at recess to protect his charge . He fought himself into such a formidable reputation , by and by , that Tom could have changed clothes with him , and "
9630	9656	8420	8420	Chambers	95	" like Sir Kay in Launcelot 's armor . He was good at games of skill , too . Tom staked him with marbles to play "
9658	9689	8420	8420	Chambers	95	" with , and then took all the winnings away from him . In the winter season Chambers was on hand , in Tom 's worn - out clothes , with "
9691	9696	8420	8420	Chambers	95	" red mittens , and "
9698	9703	8420	8420	Chambers	95	" shoes , and pants "
9705	10152	8420	8420	Chambers	95	" at the knees and seat , to drag a sled up the hill for Tom , warmly clad , to ride down on ; but he never got a ride himself . He built snow men and snow fortifications under Tom 's directions . He was Tom 's patient target when Tom wanted to do some snowballing , but the target could n't fire back . Chambers carried Tom 's skates to the river and strapped them on him , then trotted around after him on the ice , so as to be on hand when wanted ; but he was n't ever asked to try the skates himself . In summer the pet pastime of the boys of Dawson 's Landing was to steal apples , peaches , and melons from the farmers ' fruit - wagons,--mainly on account of the risk they ran of getting their heads laid open with the butt of the farmer 's whip . Tom was a distinguished adept at these thefts -- by proxy . Chambers did his stealing , and got the peach - stones , apple - cores , and melon - rinds for his share . Tom always made Chambers go in swimming with him , and stay by him as a protection . When Tom had had enough , he would slip out and tie knots in Chambers 's shirt , dip the knots in the water and make them hard to undo , then dress himself and sit by and laugh while the naked shiverer tugged at the stubborn knots with his teeth . Tom did his humble comrade these various ill turns partly out of native viciousness , and partly because he hated him for his superiorities of physique and pluck , and for his manifold cleverness . Tom could n't dive , for it gave him splitting headaches . Chambers could dive without inconvenience , and was fond of doing it . He excited so much admiration , one day , among a crowd of white boys , by throwing back somersaults from the stern of a canoe , that it wearied Tom 's spirit , and at last he shoved the canoe underneath Chambers while he was in the air -- so he came down on his head in the canoe - bottom ; and while he lay unconscious , several of Tom 's ancient adversaries saw that their long - desired opportunity was come , and they gave the false heir such a drubbing that with Chambers 's best help he was hardly able to drag himself home afterward . When the boys were fifteen and upward , Tom was "
10155	10358	8420	8420	Chambers	95	" in the river one day , when he was taken with a cramp , and shouted for help . It was a common trick with the boys -- particularly if a stranger was present -- to pretend a cramp and howl for help ; then when the stranger came tearing hand over hand to the rescue , the howler would go on struggling and howling till he was close at hand , then replace the howl with a sarcastic smile and swim blandly away , while the town boys assailed the dupe with a volley of jeers and laughter . Tom had never tried this joke as yet , but was supposed to be trying it now , so the boys held warily back ; but Chambers believed his master was in earnest , therefore he swam out , and arrived in time , unfortunately , and saved his life . This was the last feather . Tom had managed to endure everything else , but to have to remain publicly and permanently under such an obligation as this to a nigger , and to this nigger of all niggers -- this was too much . He heaped insults upon Chambers for "
10360	10454	10455	10455	Driscoll	83	" to think he was in earnest in calling for help , and said that anybody but a block - headed nigger would have known he was funning and left him alone . Tom 's enemies were in strong force here , so they came out with their opinions quite freely . They laughed at him , and called him coward , liar , sneak , and other sorts of pet names , and told him they meant to call Chambers by a new name after this , and make it common in the town--"Tom
10457	10490	10455	10455	Driscoll	83	niggerpappy,"--to signify that he had had a second birth into this life , and that Chambers was the author of his new being . Tom grew frantic under these taunts , and shouted-- "
10516	10523	10505	10505	you	95	" Chambers expostulated , and said , "
10537	10538	10540	10540	you	102	" "

10563	10627	10628	10628	her	509	" Tom sprang at him and drove his pocket - knife into him two or three times before the boys could snatch him away and give the wounded lad a chance to escape . He was considerably hurt , but not seriously . If the blade had been a little longer his career would have ended there . Tom had long ago taught Roxy "
10631	10658	10540	10540	you	102	" It had been many a day now since she had ventured a caress or a fondling epithet in his quarter . Such things , from a "
10661	10823	10824	10824	He	511	" were repulsive to him , and she had been warned to keep her distance and remember who she was . She saw her darling gradually cease from being her son , she saw that detail perish utterly ; all that was left was master -- master , pure and simple , and it was not a gentle mastership , either . She saw herself sink from the sublime height of motherhood to the somber depths of unmodified slavery . The abyss of separation between her and her boy was complete . She was merely his chattel , now , his convenience , his dog , his cringing and helpless slave , the humble and unresisting victim of his capricious temper and vicious nature . Sometimes she could not go to sleep , even when worn out with fatigue , because her rage boiled so high over the day 's experiences with her boy . She would mumble and mutter to herself-- "
10908	11481	10903	10903	I	0	" Sometimes when some outrage of peculiar offensiveness stung her to the heart , she would plan schemes of vengeance and revel in the fancied spectacle of his exposure to the world as an imposter and a slave ; but in the midst of these joys fear would strike her : she had made him too strong ; she could prove nothing , and -- heavens , she might get sold down the river for her pains ! So her schemes always went for nothing , and she laid them aside in impotent rage against the fates , and against herself for playing the fool on that fatal September day in not providing herself with a witness for use in the day when such a thing might be needed for the appeasing of her vengeance - hungry heart . And yet the moment Tom happened to be good to her , and kind,--and this occurred every now and then,--all her sore places were healed , and she was happy ; happy and proud , for this was her son , her nigger son , lording it among the whites and securely avenging their crimes against her race . There were two grand funerals in Dawson 's Landing that fall -- the fall of 1845 . One was that of Colonel Cecil Burleigh Essex , the other that of Percy Driscoll . On his death - bed Driscoll set Roxy free and delivered his idolized ostensible son solemnly into the keeping of his brother , the Judge and his wife . Those childless people were glad to get him . Childless people are not difficult to please . Judge Driscoll had gone privately to his brother , a month before , and bought Chambers . He had heard that Tom had been trying to get his father to sell the boy down the river , and he wanted to prevent the scandal -- for public sentiment did not approve of that way of treating family servants for light cause or for no cause . Percy Driscoll had worn himself out in trying to save his great speculative landed estate , and had died without succeeding . He was hardly in his grave before the boom collapsed and left his hitherto envied young devil of an heir a pauper . But that was nothing ; his uncle told him he should be his heir and have all his fortune when he died ; so Tom was comforted . Roxy had no home , now ; so she resolved to go around and say good - by to her friends and then clear out and see the world -- that is to say , she would go chambermaiding on a steamboat , the darling ambition of her race and sex . Her last call was on the black giant , Jasper . She found him chopping Pudd'nhead Wilson 's winter provision of wood . Wilson was chatting with him when Roxy arrived . He asked her how she could bear to go off chambermaiding and leave her boys ; and chaffingly offered to copy off a series of their finger - prints , reaching up to their twelfth year , for her to remember them by ; but she sobered in a moment , wondering if he suspected anything ; then she said she believed she did n't want them . Wilson said to himself , "

Mrs. York Driscoll enjoyed two years of bliss with that prize , Tom -- bliss that was troubled a little at times , it is true , but bliss nevertheless ; then she died , and her husband and his childless sister , Mrs. Pratt , continued the bliss - business at the old stand . Tom was petted and indulged and spoiled to his entire content -- or nearly that . This went on till he was nineteen , then he was sent to Yale . He went handsomely equipped with "
11689	12660	12661	12662	aunt Patsy	117	" but otherwise he was not an object of distinction there . He remained at Yale two years , and then threw up the struggle . He came home with his manners a good deal improved ; he had lost his surliness and brusqueness , and was rather pleasantly soft and smooth , now ; he was furtively , and sometimes openly , ironical of speech , and given to gently touching people on the raw , but he did it with a good - natured semiconscious air that carried it off safely , and kept him from getting into trouble . He was as indolent as ever and showed no very strenuous desire to hunt up an occupation . People argued from this that he preferred to be supported by his uncle until his uncle 's shoes should become vacant . He brought back one or two new habits with him , one of which he rather openly practised -- tippling -- but concealed another which was gambling . It would not do to gamble where his uncle could hear of it ; he knew that quite well . Tom 's Eastern polish was not popular among the young people . They could have endured it , perhaps , if Tom had stopped there ; but he wore gloves , and that they could n't stand , and would n't ; so he was mainly without society . He brought home with him a suit of clothes of such exquisite style and cut and fashion,--Eastern fashion , city fashion,--that it filled everybody with anguish and was regarded as a peculiarly wanton affront . He enjoyed the feeling which he was exciting , and paraded the town serene and happy all day ; but the young fellows set a tailor to work that night , and when Tom started out on his parade next morning he found the old deformed negro bell - ringer straddling along in his wake tricked out in a flamboyant curtain - calico exaggeration of his finery , and imitating his fancy Eastern graces as well as he could . Tom surrendered , and after that clothed himself in the local fashion . But the dull country town was tiresome to him , since his acquaintanceship with livelier regions , and it grew daily more and more so . He began to make little trips to St. Louis for refreshment . There he found companionship to suit him , and pleasures to his taste , along with more freedom , in some particulars , than he could have at home . So , during the next two years his visits to the city grew in frequency and his tarryings there grew steadily longer in duration . He was getting into deep waters . He was taking chances , privately , which might get him into trouble some day -- in fact , did . Judge Driscoll had retired from the bench and from all business activities in 1850 , and had now been comfortably idle three years . He was president of the Free - thinkers ' Society , and Pudd'nhead Wilson was the other member . The society 's weekly discussions were now the old lawyer 's main interest in life . Pudd'nhead was still toiling in obscurity at the bottom of the ladder , under the blight of that unlucky remark which he had let fall twenty - three years before about the dog . Judge Driscoll was his friend , and claimed that he had a mind above the average , but that was regarded as one of the Judge 's whims , and it failed to modify the public opinion . Or rather , that was one of the reasons why it failed , but there was another and better one . If the Judge had stopped with bare assertion , it would have had a good deal of effect ; but he made the mistake of trying to prove his position . For some years Wilson had been privately at work on a whimsical almanac , for his amusement -- a calendar , with a little dab of ostensible philosophy , usually in ironical form , appended to each date ; and the Judge thought that these quips and fancies of Wilson 's were neatly turned and cute ; so he carried a handful of them around , one day , and read them to some of the chief citizens . But irony was not for those people ; their mental vision was not focussed for it . They read those playful trifles in the solidest earnest , and decided without hesitancy that if there had ever been any doubt that Dave Wilson was a pudd'nhead -- which there hadn't -- this revelation removed that doubt for good and all . That is just the way in this world ; an enemy can partly ruin a man , but it takes a good - natured injudicious friend to complete the thing and make it perfect . After this the Judge felt tenderer than ever toward Wilson , and surer than ever that his calendar had merit . Judge Driscoll could be a free - thinker and still hold his place in society because he was the person of most consequence in the community , and therefore could venture to go his own way and follow out his own notions . The other member of his pet organization was allowed the like liberty because he was a cipher in the estimation of the public , and nobody attached any importance to what he thought or did . He was liked , he was welcome enough all around , but he simply did n't count for anything . The widow Cooper -- affectionately called "
12663	13071	13072	13072	Italians	1741	" by everybody -- lived in a snug and comely cottage with her daughter Rowena , who was nineteen , romantic , amiable , and very pretty , but otherwise of no consequence . Rowena had a couple of young brothers -- also of no consequence . The widow had a large spare room which she let to a lodger , with board , when she could find one , but this room had been empty for a year now , to her sorrow . Her income was only sufficient for the family support , and she needed the lodging - money for trifling luxuries . But now , at last , on a flaming June day , she found herself happy ; her tedious wait was ended ; her year - worn advertisement had been answered ; and not by a village applicant , oh , no!--this letter was from away off yonder in the dim great world to the North : it was from St. Louis . She sat on her porch gazing out with unseeing eyes upon the shining reaches of the mighty Mississippi , her thoughts steeped in her good fortune . Indeed , it was specially good fortune , for she was to have two lodgers instead of one . She had read the letter to the family , and Rowena had danced away to see to the cleaning and airing of the room by the slave woman Nancy , and the boys had rushed abroad in the town to spread the great news , for it was matter of public interest , and the public would wonder and not be pleased if not informed . Presently Rowena returned , all ablush with joyous excitement , and begged for a re - reading of the letter . It was framed thus : Honored Madam : My brother and I have seen your advertisement , by chance , and beg leave to take the room you offer . We are twenty - four years of age and twins . We are Italians by birth , but have lived long in the various countries of Europe , and several years in the United States . Our names are Luigi and Angelo Capello . You desire but one guest ; but dear Madam , if you will allow us to pay for two , we will not incommode you . We shall be down Thursday . "

13267	13764	13259	13259	I	0	" The Judge was full of congratulations and curiosity . The letter was read and discussed . Soon Justice Robinson arrived with more congratulations , and there was a new reading and a new discussion . This was the beginning . Neighbor after neighbor , of both sexes , followed , and the procession drifted in and out all day and evening and all Wednesday and Thursday . The letter was read and re - read until it was nearly worn out ; everybody admired its courtly and gracious tone , and smooth and practised style , everybody was sympathetic and excited , and the Coopers were steeped in happiness all the while . The boats were very uncertain in low water , in these primitive times . This time the Thursday boat had not arrived at ten at night -- so the people had waited at the landing all day for nothing ; they were driven to their homes by a heavy storm without having had a view of the illustrious foreigners . Eleven o'clock came ; and the Cooper house was the only one in the town that still had lights burning . The rain and thunder were booming yet , and the anxious family were still waiting , still hoping . At last there was a knock at the door and the family jumped to open it . Two negro men entered , each carrying a trunk , and proceeded up - stairs toward the guest - room . Then entered the twins -- the handsomest , the best dressed , the most distinguished - looking pair of young fellows the West had ever seen . One was a little fairer than the other , but otherwise they were exact duplicates . CHAPTER VI . Swimming in Glory .

At breakfast in the morning the twins ' charm of manner and easy and polished bearing made speedy conquest of the family 's good graces . All constraint and formality quickly disappeared , and the friendliest feeling succeeded . Aunt Patsy called them by their Christian names almost from the beginning . She was full of the keenest curiosity about them , and showed it ; they responded by talking about themselves , which pleased her greatly . It presently appeared that in their early youth they had known poverty and hardship . As the talk wandered along the old lady watched for the right place to drop in a question or two concerning that matter , and when she found it she said to the blond twin who was now doing the biographies in his turn while the brunette one rested-- "

Our parents could have made themselves comfortable by exhibiting us as a show , and they had many and large offers ; but the thought revolted their pride , and they said they would starve and die first . But what they would n't consent to do we had to do without the formality of consent . We were seized for the debts occasioned by their illness and their funerals , and placed among the attractions of a cheap museum in Berlin to earn the liquidation money . It took us two years to get out of that slavery . We traveled all about Germany receiving no wages , and not even our keep . We had to be exhibited for nothing , and beg our bread . "

It was a proud occasion for the widow , and she promised herself high satisfaction in showing off her fine foreign birds before her neighbors and friends -- simple folk who had hardly ever seen a foreigner of any kind , and never one of any distinction or style . Yet her feeling was moderate indeed when contrasted with Rowena 's . Rowena was in the clouds , she walked on air ; this was to be the greatest day , the most romantic episode , in the colorless history of that dull country town . She was to be familiarly near the source of its glory and feel the full flood of it pour over her and about her ; the other girls could only gaze and envy , not partake . The widow was ready , Rowena was ready , so also were the foreigners . The party moved along the hall , the twins in advance , and entered the open parlor door , whence issued a low hum of conversation . The twins took a position near the door , the widow stood at Luigi 's side , Rowena stood beside Angelo , and the march - past and the introductions began . The widow was all smiles and contentment . She received the procession and passed it on to Rowena . "

None of them had ever seen a person bearing a title of nobility before , and none had been expecting to see one now , consequently the title came upon them as a kind of pile - driving surprise and caught them unprepared . A few tried to rise to the emergency , and got out an awkward "
14772	14774	14769	14770	My lord	545	" or "
14778	14910	14775	14776	Your lordship	547	" or something of that sort , but the great majority were overwhelmed by the unaccustomed word and its dim and awful associations with gilded courts and stately ceremony and anointed kingship , so they only fumbled through the hand - shake and passed on , speechless . Now and then , as happens at all receptions everywhere , a more than ordinary friendly soul blocked the procession and kept it waiting while he inquired how the brothers liked the village , and how long they were going to stay , and if their families were well , and dragged in the weather , and hoped it would get cooler soon , and all that sort of thing , so as to be able to say , when they got home , "
14919	15003	14769	14770	My lord	545	" ; but nobody did or said anything of a regrettable kind , and so the great affair went through to the end in a creditable and satisfactory fashion . General conversation followed , and the twins drifted about from group to group , talking easily and fluently and winning approval , compelling admiration and achieving favor from all . The widow followed their conquering march with a proud eye , and every now and then Rowena said to herself with deep satisfaction , "
15014	16968	14775	14776	Your lordship	547	" There were no idle moments for mother or daughter . Eager inquiries concerning the twins were pouring into their enchanted ears all the time ; each was the constant center of a group of breathless listeners ; each recognized that she knew now for the first time the real meaning of that great word Glory , and perceived the stupendous value of it , and understood why men in all ages had been willing to throw away meaner happinesses , treasure , life itself , to get a taste of its sublime and supreme joy . Napoleon and all his kind stood accounted for -- and justified . When Rowena had at last done all her duty by the people in the parlor , she went up - stairs to satisfy the longings of an overflow - meeting there , for the parlor was not big enough to hold all the comers . Again she was besieged by eager questioners and again she swam in sunset seas of glory . When the forenoon was nearly gone , she recognized with a pang that this most splendid episode of her life was almost over , that nothing could prolong it , that nothing quite its equal could ever fall to her fortune again . But never mind , it was sufficient unto itself , the grand occasion had moved on an ascending scale from the start , and was a noble and memorable success . If the twins could but do some crowning act , now , to climax it , something unusual , something startling , something to concentrate upon themselves the company 's loftiest admiration , something in the nature of an electric surprise-- Here a prodigious slam - banging broke out below , and everybody rushed down to see . It was the twins knocking out a classic four - handed piece on the piano , in great style . Rowena was satisfied -- satisfied down to the bottom of her heart . The young strangers were kept long at the piano . The villagers were astonished and enchanted with the magnificence of their performance , and could not bear to have them stop . All the music that they had ever heard before seemed spiritless prentice - work and barren of grace or charm when compared with these intoxicating floods of melodious sound . They realized that for once in their lives they were hearing masters . CHAPTER VII . The Unknown Nymph One of the most striking differences between a cat and a lie is that a cat has only nine lives.--Pudd'nhead Wilson 's Calendar . The company broke up reluctantly , and drifted toward their several homes , chatting with vivacity , and all agreeing that it would be many a long day before Dawson 's Landing would see the equal of this one again . The twins had accepted several invitations while the reception was in progress , and had also volunteered to play some duets at an amateur entertainment for the benefit of a local charity . Society was eager to receive them to its bosom . Judge Driscoll had the good fortune to secure them for an immediate drive , and to be the first to display them in public . They entered his buggy with him , and were paraded down the main street , everybody flocking to the windows and sidewalks to see . The Judge showed the strangers the new graveyard , and the jail , and where the richest man lived , and the Freemasons ' hall , and the Methodist church , and the Presbyterian church , and where the Baptist church was going to be when they got some money to build it with , and showed them the town hall and the slaughter - house , and got out the independent fire company in uniform and had them put out an imaginary fire ; then he let them inspect the muskets of the militia company , and poured out an exhaustless stream of enthusiasm over all these splendors , and seemed very well satisfied with the responses he got , for the twins admired his admiration , and paid him back the best they could , though they could have done better if some fifteen or sixteen hundred thousand previous experiences of this sort in various countries had not already rubbed off a considerable part of the novelty of it . The Judge laid himself out hospitably to make them have a good time , and if there was a defect anywhere it was not his fault . He told them a good many humorous anecdotes , and always forgot the nub , but they were always able to furnish it , for these yarns were of a pretty early vintage , and they had had many a rejuvenating pull at them before . And he told them all about his several dignities , and how he had held this and that and the other place of honor or profit , and had once been to the legislature , and was now president of the Society of Free - thinkers . He said the society had been in existence four years , and already had two members , and was firmly established . He would call for the brothers in the evening if they would like to attend a meeting of it . Accordingly he called for them , and on the way he told them all about Pudd'nhead Wilson , in order that they might get a favorable impression of him in advance and be prepared to like him . This scheme succeeded -- the favorable impression was achieved . Later it was confirmed and solidified when Wilson proposed that out of courtesy to the strangers the usual topics be put aside and the hour be devoted to conversation upon ordinary subjects and the cultivation of friendly relations and good - fellowship,--a proposition which was put to vote and carried . The hour passed quickly away in lively talk , and when it was ended the lonesome and neglected Wilson was richer by two friends than he had been when it began . He invited the twins to look in at his lodgings , presently , after disposing of an intervening engagement , and they accepted with pleasure . Toward the middle of the evening they found themselves on the road to his house . Pudd'nhead was at home waiting for them and putting in his time puzzling over a thing which had come under his notice that morning . The matter was this : He happened to be up very early -- at dawn , in fact ; and he crossed the hall which divided his cottage through the center , and entered a room to get something there . The window of the room had no curtains , for that side of the house had long been unoccupied , and through this window he caught sight of something which surprised and interested him . It was a young woman -- a young woman where properly no young woman belonged ; for she was in Judge Driscoll 's house , and in the bedroom over the Judge 's private study or sitting - room . This was young Tom Driscoll 's bedroom . He and the Judge , the Judge 's widowed sister Mrs. Pratt and three negro servants were the only people who belonged in the house . Who , then , might this young lady be ? The two houses were separated by an ordinary yard , with a low fence running back through its middle from the street in front to the lane in the rear . The distance was not great , and Wilson was able to see the girl very well , the window - shades of the room she was in being up , and the window also . The girl had on a neat and trim summer dress , patterned in broad stripes of pink and white , and her bonnet was equipped with a pink veil . She was practising steps , gaits and attitudes , apparently ; she was doing the thing gracefully , and was very much absorbed in her work . Who could she be , and how came she to be in young Tom Driscoll 's room ? Wilson had quickly chosen a position from which he could watch the girl without running much risk of being seen by her , and he remained there hoping she would raise her veil and betray her face . But she disappointed him . After a matter of twenty minutes she disappeared , and although he stayed at his post half an hour longer , she came no more . Toward noon he dropped in at the Judge 's and talked with Mrs. Pratt about the great event of the day , the levee of the distinguished foreigners at Aunt Patsy Cooper 's . He asked after her nephew Tom , and she said he was on his way home , and that she was expecting him to arrive a little before night ; and added that she and the Judge were gratified to gather from his letters that he was conducting himself very nicely and creditably -- at which Wilson winked to himself privately . Wilson did not ask if there was a newcomer in the house , but he asked questions that would have brought light - throwing answers as to that matter if Mrs. Pratt had had any light to throw ; so he went away satisfied that he knew of things that were going on in her house of which she herself was not aware . He was now waiting for the twins , and still puzzling over the problem of who that girl might be , and how she happened to be in that young fellow 's room at daybreak in the morning . CHAPTER VIII .

Consider well the proportions of things . It is better to be a young June - bug than an old bird of paradise.--Pudd'nhead Wilson 's Calendar . It is necessary now , to hunt up Roxy . At the time she was set free and went away chambermaiding , she was thirty - five . She got a berth as second chambermaid on a Cincinnati boat in the New Orleans trade , the Grand Mogul . A couple of trips made her wonted and easy - going at the work , and infatuated her with the stir and adventure and independence of steamboat life . Then she was promoted and became head chambermaid . She was a favorite with the officers , and exceedingly proud of their joking and friendly way with her . During eight years she served three parts of the year on that boat , and the winters on a Vicksburg packet . But now for two months she had had rheumatism in her arms , and was obliged to let the wash - tub alone . So she resigned . But she was well fixed -- rich , as she would have described it ; for she had lived a steady life , and had banked four dollars every month in New Orleans as a provision for her old age . She said in the start that she had "
16981	17683	14775	14776	Your lordship	547	" and that one mistake like that was enough ; she would be independent of the human race thenceforth forevermore if hard work and economy could accomplish it . When the boat touched the levee at New Orleans she bade good - by to her comrades on the Grand Mogul and moved her kit ashore . But she was back in a hour . The bank had gone to smash and carried her four hundred dollars with it . She was a pauper , and homeless . Also disabled bodily , at least for the present . The officers were full of sympathy for her in her trouble , and made up a little purse for her . She resolved to go to her birthplace ; she had friends there among the negroes , and the unfortunate always help the unfortunate , she was well aware of that ; those lowly comrades of her youth would not let her starve . She took the little local packet at Cairo , and now she was on the home - stretch . Time had worn away her bitterness against her son , and she was able to think of him with serenity . She put the vile side of him out of her mind , and dwelt only on recollections of his occasional acts of kindness to her . She gilded and otherwise decorated these , and made them very pleasant to contemplate . She began to long to see him . She would go and fawn upon him , slave - like -- for this would have to be her attitude , of course -- and maybe she would find that time had modified him , and that he would be glad to see his long - forgotten old nurse and treat her gently . That would be lovely ; that would make her forget her woes and her poverty . Her poverty ! That thought inspired her to add another castle to her dream : maybe he would give her a trifle now and then -- maybe a dollar , once a month , say ; any little thing like that would help , oh , ever so much . By the time she reached Dawson 's Landing she was her old self again ; her blues were gone , she was in high feather . She would get along , surely ; there were many kitchens where the servants would share their meals with her , and also steal sugar and apples and other dainties for her to carry home -- or give her a chance to pilfer them herself , which would answer just as well . And there was the church . She was a more rabid and devoted Methodist than ever , and her piety was no sham , but was strong and sincere . Yes , with plenty of creature comforts and her old place in the amen - corner in her possession again , she would be perfectly happy and at peace thenceforward to the end . She went to Judge Driscoll 's kitchen first of all . She was received there in great form and with vast enthusiasm . Her wonderful travels , and the strange countries she had seen and the adventures she had had , made her a marvel , and a heroine of romance . The negroes hung enchanted upon the great story of her experiences , interrupting her all along with eager questions , with laughter , exclamations of delight and expressions of applause ; and she was obliged to confess to herself that if there was anything better in this world than steamboating , it was the glory to be got by telling about it . The audience loaded her stomach with their dinners , and then stole the pantry bare to load up her basket . Tom was in St. Louis . The servants said he had spent the best part of his time there during the previous two years . Roxy came every day , and had many talks about the family and its affairs .

Time had not modified his ancient detestation of the humble drudge and protector of his boyhood ; it was still bitter and uncompromising . He sat up and bent a severe gaze upon the fair face of the young fellow whose name he was unconsciously using and whose family rights he was enjoying . He maintained the gaze until the victim of it had become satisfactorily pallid with terror , then he said-- "

He saw what was coming , and bent his head sideways , and put up his left arm to shield it . Tom rained cuffs upon the head and its shield , saying no word : the victim received each blow with a beseeching , "

Roxy had for so many days nourished and fondled and petted her notion that Tom would be glad to see his old nurse , and would make her proud and happy to the marrow with a cordial word or two , that it took two rebuffs to convince her that he was not funning , and that her beautiful dream was a fond and foolish vanity , a shabby and pitiful mistake . She was hurt to the heart , and so ashamed that for a moment she did not quite know what to do or how to act . Then her breast began to heave , the tears came , and in her forlornness she was moved to try that other dream of hers -- an appeal to her boy 's charity ; and so , upon the impulse , and without reflection , she offered her supplication : "

She raised her head slowly , till it was well up , and at the same time her great frame unconsciously assumed an erect and masterful attitude , with all the majesty and grace of her vanished youth in it . She raised her finger and punctuated with it : "
19566	19625	19626	19626	You	102	" A cold chill went to Tom 's heart , he did n't know why ; for he did not reflect that such words , from such an incongruous source , and so solemnly delivered , could not easily fail of that effect . However , he did the natural thing : he replied with bluster and mockery : "

She said , with a grim implacability in voice and manner which made Tom almost realize that even a former slave can remember for ten minutes insults and injuries returned for compliments and flatteries received , and can also enjoy taking revenge for them when the opportunity offers : "

Roxy was standing in the door of one of the rooms , waiting , for she had heard him . This was a two - story log house which had acquired the reputation a few years before of being haunted , and that was the end of its usefulness . Nobody would live in it afterward , or go near it by night , and most people even gave it a wide berth in the daytime . As it had no competition , it was called the haunted house . It was getting crazy and ruinous , now , from long neglect . It stood three hundred yards beyond Pudd'nhead Wilson 's house , with nothing between but vacancy . It was the last house in the town at that end . Tom followed Roxy into the room . She had a pile of clean straw in the corner for a bed , some cheap but well - kept clothing was hanging on the wall , there was a tin lantern freckling the floor with little spots of light , and there were various soap - and - candle boxes scattered about , which served for chairs . The two sat down . Roxy said-- "

She could have proved nothing to anybody , and her threat about the writings was a lie ; but she knew the person she was dealing with , and had made both statements without any doubt as to the effect they would produce . She went and sat down on her candle - box , and the pride and pomp of her victorious attitude made it a throne . She said-- "

His mother approved of his conduct , and offered to help , but this frightened him . He tremblingly ventured to say that if she would retire from the town he should feel better and safer , and could hold his head higher -- and was going on to make an argument , but she interrupted and surprised him pleasantly by saying she was ready ; it did n't make any difference to her where she stayed , so that she got her share of the pension regularly . She said she would not go far , and would call at the haunted house once a month for her money . Then she said-- "

The tremendous catastrophe which had befallen Tom had changed his moral landscape in much the same way . Some of his low places he found lifted to ideals , some of his ideals had sunk to the valleys , and lay there with the sackcloth and ashes of pumice - stone and sulphur on their ruined heads . For days he wandered in lonely places , thinking , thinking , thinking -- trying to get his bearings . It was new work . If he met a friend , he found that the habit of a lifetime had in some mysterious way vanished -- his arm hung limp , instead of involuntarily extending the hand for a shake . It was the "

So strange and uncharacteristic was Tom 's conduct that people noticed it , and turned to look after him when he passed on ; and when he glanced back -- as he could not help doing , in spite of his best resistance -- and caught that puzzled expression in a person 's face , it gave him a sick feeling , and he took himself out of view as quickly as he could . He presently came to have a hunted sense and a hunted look , and then he fled away to the hill - tops and the solitudes . He said to himself that the curse of Ham was upon him . He dreaded his meals ; the "
23831	23859	23872	23873	a nigger	1452	" in him was ashamed to sit at the white folks ' table , and feared discovery all the time ; and once when Judge Driscoll said , "

23941	23955	23956	23956	He	693	" was steadily growing in his heart ; for he said to himself , "
23985	24246	23973	23973	he	693	" For as much as a week after this , Tom imagined that his character had undergone a pretty radical change . But that was because he did not know himself . In several ways his opinions were totally changed , and would never go back to what they were before , but the main structure of his character was not changed , and could not be changed . One or two very important features of it were altered , and in time effects would result from this , if opportunity offered -- effects of a quite serious nature , too . Under the influence of a great mental and moral upheaval his character and habits had taken on the appearance of complete change , but after a while with the subsidence of the storm both began to settle toward their former places . He dropped gradually back into his old frivolous and easy - going ways and conditions of feeling and manner of speech , and no familiar of his could have detected anything in him that differentiated him from the weak and careless Tom of other days . The theft - raid which he had made upon the village turned out better than he had ventured to hope . It produced the sum necessary to pay his gaming - debts , and saved him from exposure to his uncle and another smashing of the will . He and his mother learned to like each other fairly well . She could n't love him , as yet , because there "
24252	25441	23973	23973	he	693	" as she expressed it , but her nature needed something or somebody to rule over , and he was better than nothing . Her strong character and aggressive and commanding ways compelled Tom 's admiration in spite of the fact that he got more illustrations of them than he needed for his comfort . However , as a rule her conversation was made up of racy tattle about the privacies of the chief families of the town ( for she went harvesting among their kitchens every time she came to the village ) , and Tom enjoyed this . It was just in his line . She always collected her half of his pension punctually , and he was always at the haunted house to have a chat with her on these occasions . Every now and then she paid him a visit there on between - days also . Occasionally he would run up to St. Louis for a few weeks , and at last temptation caught him again . He won a lot of money , but lost it , and with it a deal more besides , which he promised to raise as soon as possible . For this purpose he projected a new raid on his town . He never meddled with any other town , for he was afraid to venture into houses whose ins and outs he did not know and the habits of whose households he was not acquainted with . He arrived at the haunted house in disguise on the Wednesday before the advent of the twins -- after writing his aunt Pratt that he would not arrive until two days after -- and lay in hiding there with his mother until toward daylight Friday morning , when he went to his uncle 's house and entered by the back way with his own key , and slipped up to his room , where he could have the use of the mirror and toilet articles . He had a suit of girl 's clothes with him in a bundle as a disguise for his raid , and was wearing a suit of his mother 's clothing , with black gloves and veil . By dawn he was tricked out for his raid , but he caught a glimpse of Pudd'nhead Wilson through the window over the way , and knew that Pudd'nhead had caught a glimpse of him . So he entertained Wilson with some airs and graces and attitudes for a while , then stepped out of sight and resumed the other disguise , and by and by went down and out the back way and started down town to reconnoiter the scene of his intended labors . But he was ill at ease . He had changed back to Roxy 's dress , with the stoop of age added to the disguise , so that Wilson would not bother himself about a humble old woman leaving a neighbor 's house by the back way in the early morning , in case he was still spying . But supposing Wilson had seen him leave , and had thought it suspicious , and had also followed him ? The thought made Tom cold . He gave up the raid for the day , and hurried back to the haunted house by the obscurest route he knew . His mother was gone ; but she came back , by and by , with the news of the grand reception at Patsy Cooper 's , and soon persuaded him that the opportunity was like a special providence , it was so inviting and perfect . So he went raiding , after all , and made a nice success of it while everybody was gone to Patsy Cooper 's . Success gave him nerve and even actual intrepidity ; insomuch , indeed , that after he had conveyed his harvest to his mother in a back alley , he went to the reception himself , and added several of the valuables of that house to his takings . After this long digression we have now arrived once more at the point where Pudd'nhead Wilson , while waiting for the arrival of the twins on that same Friday evening , sat puzzling over the strange apparition of that morning -- a girl in young Tom Driscoll 's bedroom ; fretting , and guessing , and puzzling over it , and wondering who the shameless creature might be . CHAPTER XI . Pudd'nhead 's Startling Discovery . There are three infallible ways of pleasing an author , and the three form a rising scale of compliment : 1 , to tell him you have read one of his books ; 2 , to tell him you have read all of his books ; 3 , to ask him to let you read the manuscript of his forthcoming book . No . 1 admits you to his respect ; No . 2 admits you to his admiration ; No . 3 carries you clear into his heart.--Pudd'nhead Wilson 's Calendar . As to the Adjective : when in doubt , strike it out.--Pudd'nhead Wilson 's Calendar . The twins arrived presently , and talk began . It flowed along chattily and sociably , and under its influence the new friendship gathered ease and strength . Wilson got out his Calendar , by request , and read a passage or two from it , which the twins praised quite cordially . This pleased the author so much that he complied gladly when they asked him to lend them a batch of the work to read at home . In the course of their wide travels they had found out that there are three sure ways of pleasing an author ; they were now working the best of the three . There was an interruption , now . Young Tom Driscoll appeared , and joined the party . He pretended to be seeing the distinguished strangers for the first time when they rose to shake hands ; but this was only a blind , as he had already had a glimpse of them , at the reception , while robbing the house . The twins made mental note that he was smooth - faced and rather handsome , and smooth and undulatory in his movements -- graceful , in fact . Angelo thought he had a good eye ; Luigi thought there was something veiled and sly about it . Angelo thought he had a pleasant free - and - easy way of talking ; Luigi thought it was more so than was agreeable . Angelo thought he was a sufficiently nice young man ; Luigi reserved his decision . Tom 's first contribution to the conversation was a question which he had put to Wilson a hundred times before . It was always cheerily and good - naturedly put , and always inflicted a little pang , for it touched a secret sore ; but this time the pang was sharp , since strangers were present . "
25456	25465	23973	23973	he	693	" Wilson bit his lip , but answered , "
25471	25510	23973	23973	he	693	" with as much indifference as he could assume . Judge Driscoll had generously left the law feature out of the Wilson biography which he had furnished to the twins . Young Tom laughed pleasantly , and said : "
25525	25542	25519	25519	he	86	" The sarcasm bit , but Wilson kept himself under control , and said without passion : "
25644	25648	25649	25649	I	0	" Tom winced . "
25696	25697	25684	25684	I	0	" "
25742	25750	25740	25740	Dave	84	" and the young fellow laughed again . "
25755	25773	25752	25752	you	699	" Wilson had thought of the girl in Tom 's bedroom , and was going to say , "
25795	25804	25775	25775	you	699	" but thought better of it and said , "
25818	25819	25775	25775	you	699	" "
25910	25921	25922	25922	I	0	" Wilson brought three of his glass strips , and said-- "
26000	26001	25995	25995	You	699	" "
26017	26018	26006	26006	you	0	" "
26037	26038	26022	26022	you	0	" "
26064	26129	26130	26130	I	0	" He passed his fingers through his crop of short hair , and pressed them one at a time on the glass . Angelo made a print of his fingers on another glass , and Luigi followed with the third . Wilson marked the glasses with names and date , and put them away . Tom gave one of his little laughs , and said-- "
26176	26177	26171	26174	the fellow - twin	707	" "
26195	26204	26186	26186	I	0	" said Wilson , returning to his place . "
26211	26215	26216	26216	you	84	" said Tom , "
26432	26491	26492	26492	We	719	" Wilson winced under this nagging and not very courteous chaff , and the twins suffered with him and for him . They rightly judged , now , that the best way to relieve him would be to take the thing in earnest and treat it with respect , ignoring Tom 's rather overdone raillery ; so Luigi said-- "
26545	26554	26604	26604	you	0	" Tom looked surprised and incredulous . He said-- "
26571	26572	26569	26569	you	0	" "
26599	26600	26581	26581	we	719	" "
26615	26627	26604	26604	you	0	" asked Tom , his incredulity beginning to weaken a little . "
26635	26639	26604	26604	you	0	" said Angelo : "
26687	26688	26712	26712	they	723	" "
26696	26708	26712	26712	they	723	" exclaimed Tom , who was now becoming very much interested . "
26727	26728	26712	26712	they	723	" "
26736	26740	26712	26712	they	723	" said Luigi . "
26817	26831	26832	26832	Dave	84	" Tom was entirely sobered , and profoundly impressed . He said , apologetically-- "
26872	26873	26870	26870	you	84	" "
27055	27064	27052	27053	an expert	724	" He took Luigi 's hand . Tom said-- "
27125	27147	27118	27118	Dave	84	" Luigi wrote a line privately , and folded up the piece of paper , and handed it to Tom , saying-- "
27163	27408	27148	27148	I	0	" Wilson began to study Luigi 's palm , tracing life lines , heart lines , head lines , and so on , and noting carefully their relations with the cobweb of finer and more delicate marks and lines that enmeshed them on all sides ; he felt of the fleshy cushion at the base of the thumb , and noted its shape ; he felt of the fleshy side of the hand between the wrist and the base of the little finger , and noted its shape also ; he painstakingly examined the fingers , observing their form , proportions , and natural manner of disposing themselves when in repose . All this process was watched by the three spectators with absorbing interest , their heads bent together over Luigi 's palm , and nobody disturbing the stillness with a word . Wilson now entered upon a close survey of the palm again , and his revelations began . He mapped out Luigi 's character and disposition , his tastes , aversions , proclivities , ambitions , and eccentricities in a way which sometimes made Luigi wince and the others laugh , but both twins declared that the chart was artistically drawn and was correct . Next , Wilson took up Luigi 's history . He proceeded cautiously and with hesitation , now , moving his finger slowly along the great lines of the palm , and now and then halting it at a "
27410	27450	27159	27159	he	84	" or some such landmark , and examining that neighborhood minutely . He proclaimed one or two past events , Luigi confirmed his correctness , and the search went on . Presently Wilson glanced up suddenly with a surprised expression-- "
27466	27467	27148	27148	I	0	" "
27472	27480	27148	27148	I	0	" said Luigi , good - naturedly ; "
27489	27509	27510	27510	I	0	" But Wilson still hesitated , and did not seem quite to know what to do . Then he said-- "
27550	27551	27524	27524	I	0	" "
27556	27560	27524	27524	I	0	" said Luigi ; "
27564	27588	27524	27524	I	0	" Wilson wrote something on a slip of paper and handed it to Luigi , who read it to himself and said to Tom-- "
27599	27603	27596	27597	Mr. Driscoll	83	" Tom read : "
27623	27627	27628	27629	Great Scott	152	" Tom added , "
27631	27642	27628	27629	Great Scott	152	" Luigi handed Wilson 's paper to Tom , and said-- "
27648	27652	27628	27629	Great Scott	152	" Tom read : "
27673	27674	27667	27667	I	0	" "
27679	27686	27667	27667	I	0	" commented Tom , with astonishment . "

27773	27779	27751	27751	you	739	" said Luigi , reposefully , "

27834	27840	27828	27828	he	692	" said Angelo , warmly . "

27885	27889	27823	27823	he	692	" said Wilson ; "

27913	27917	27823	27823	he	692	" said Luigi , "

28005	28009	28000	28000	your	739	" said Angelo , "
28153	28166	28146	28146	I	0	" He took a sheet of paper and made a rapid sketch . "
28368	28373	28351	28351	You	739	" Tom said to himself-- "
28398	28399	28391	28391	I	0	" "
28408	28412	28413	28413	Our	752	" said Wilson . "

28610	28634	28595	28595	his	119	" Wilson and Tom drew deep breaths , and after some general chat about the tragedy , Pudd'nhead said , taking Tom 's hand-- "
28668	28684	28687	28687	he	119	" Tom had snatched away his hand , and was looking a good deal confused . "
28691	28706	28687	28687	he	119	" said Luigi . Tom darted an ugly look at him , and said sharply-- "
28722	28743	28719	28720	a murderer	761	" Luigi 's dark face flushed , but before he could speak or move , Tom added with anxious haste : "
28778	29380	28773	28773	you	762	" Wilson came to the rescue , and smoothed things down as well as he could ; and in fact was entirely successful as far as the twins were concerned , for they felt sorrier for the affront put upon him by his guest 's outburst of ill manners than for the insult offered to Luigi . But the success was not so pronounced with the offender . Tom tried to seem at his ease , and he went through the motions fairly well , but at bottom he felt resentful toward all the three witnesses of his exhibition ; in fact , he felt so annoyed at them for having witnessed it and noticed it that he almost forgot to feel annoyed at himself for placing it before them . However , something presently happened which made him almost comfortable , and brought him nearly back to a state of charity and friendliness . This was a little spat between the twins ; not much of a spat , but still a spat ; and before they got far with it they were in a decided condition of irritation with each other . Tom was charmed ; so pleased , indeed , that he cautiously did what he could to increase the irritation while pretending to be actuated by more respectable motives . By his help the fire got warmed up to the blazing - point , and he might have had the happiness of seeing the flames show up , in another moment , but for the interruption of a knock on the door -- an interruption which fretted him as much as it gratified Wilson . Wilson opened the door . The visitor was a good - natured , ignorant , energetic , middle - aged Irishman named John Buckstone , who was a great politician in a small way , and always took a large share in public matters of every sort . One of the town 's chief excitements , just now , was over the matter of rum . There was a strong rum party and a strong anti - rum party . Buckstone was training with the rum party , and he had been sent to hunt up the twins and invite them to attend a mass - meeting of that faction . He delivered his errand , and said the clans were already gathering in the big hall over the market - house . Luigi accepted the invitation cordially , Angelo less cordially , since he disliked crowds , and did not drink the powerful intoxicants of America . In fact , he was even a teetotaler sometimes -- when it was judicious to be one . The twins left with Buckstone , and Tom Driscoll joined company with them uninvited . In the distance one could see a long wavering line of torches drifting down the main street , and could hear the throbbing of the bass drum , the clash of cymbals , the squeaking of a fife or two , and the faint roar of remote hurrahs . The tail - end of this procession was climbing the market - house stairs when the twins arrived in its neighborhood ; when they reached the hall it was full of people , torches , smoke , noise and enthusiasm . They were conducted to the platform by Buckstone -- Tom Driscoll still following -- and were delivered to the chairman in the midst of a prodigious explosion of welcome . When the noise had moderated a little , the chair proposed that "
29414	29443	28773	28773	you	762	" This eloquent discharge opened the flood - gates of enthusiasm again , and the election was carried with thundering unanimity . Then arose a storm of cries : "
29457	29492	28773	28773	you	762	" Glasses of whisky were handed to the twins . Luigi waved his aloft , then brought it to his lips ; but Angelo set his down . There was another storm of cries : "
29502	29503	29498	29500	the other one	767	" "
29515	29516	29506	29508	the blond one	768	" "
29521	29529	29506	29508	the blond one	768	" The chairman inquired , and then reported-- "
29591	29748	29570	29570	He	120	" There was a general burst of laughter , plentifully accented with whistlings and cat - calls , but the energetic use of the gavel presently restored something like order . Then a man spoke from the crowd , and said that while he was very sorry that the mistake had been made , it would not be possible to rectify it at the present meeting . According to the by - laws it must go over to the next regular meeting for action . He would not offer a motion , as none was required . He desired to apologize to the gentleman in the name of the house , and begged to assure him that as far as it might lie in the power of the Sons of Liberty , his temporary membership in the order would be made pleasant to him . This speech was received with great applause , mixed with cries of-- "
29754	29755	29570	29570	He	120	" "
29770	29771	29767	29768	a teetotaler	2123	" "
29776	29777	29767	29768	a teetotaler	2123	" "
29787	29966	29967	29967	Boys	774	" Glasses were handed around , and everybody on the platform drank Angelo 's health , while the house bellowed forth in song : For he 's a jolly good fel - low , For he 's a jolly good fel - low , For he 's a jolly good fe - el - low,-- Which nobody can deny . Tom Driscoll drank . It was his second glass , for he had drunk Angelo 's the moment that Angelo had set it down . The two drinks made him very merry -- almost idiotically so -- and he began to take a most lively and prominent part in the proceedings , particularly in the music and cat - calls and side - remarks . The chairman was still standing at the front , the twins at his side . The extraordinarily close resemblance of the brothers to each other suggested a witticism to Tom Driscoll , and just as the chairman began a speech he skipped forward and said with an air of tipsy confidence to the audience-- "
29986	30297	29977	29979	this human philopena	775	" The descriptive aptness of the phrase caught the house , and a mighty burst of laughter followed . Luigi 's southern blood leaped to the boiling - point in a moment under the sharp humiliation of this insult delivered in the presence of four hundred strangers . It was not in the young man 's nature to let the matter pass , or to delay the squaring of the account . He took a couple of strides and halted behind the unsuspecting joker . Then he drew back and delivered a kick of such titanic vigor that it lifted Tom clear over the footlights and landed him on the heads of the front row of the Sons of Liberty . Even a sober person does not like to have a human being emptied on him when he is not doing any harm ; a person who is not sober can not endure such an attention at all . The nest of Sons of Liberty that Driscoll landed in had not a sober bird in it ; in fact there was probably not an entirely sober one in the auditorium . Driscoll was promptly and indignantly flung on to the heads of Sons in the next row , and these Sons passed him on toward the rear , and then immediately began to pummel the front - row Sons who had passed him to them . This course was strictly followed by bench after bench as Driscoll traveled in his tumultuous and airy flight toward the door ; so he left behind him an ever lengthening wake of raging and plunging and fighting and swearing humanity . Down went group after group of torches , and presently above the deafening clatter of the gavel , roar of angry voices , and crash of succumbing benches , rose the paralyzing cry of "
30300	30834	31226	31228	the great lawyer"--an	2216	" The fighting ceased instantly ; the cursing ceased ; for one distinctly defined moment there was a dead hush , a motionless calm , where the tempest had been ; then with one impulse the multitude awoke to life and energy again , and went surging and struggling and swaying , this way and that , its outer edges melting away through windows and doors and gradually lessening the pressure and relieving the mass . The fire - boys were never on hand so suddenly before ; for there was no distance to go , this time , their quarters being in the rear end of the market - house . There was an engine company and a hook - and - ladder company . Half of each was composed of rummies and the other half of anti - rummies , after the moral and political share - and - share - alike fashion of the frontier town of the period . Enough anti - rummies were loafing in quarters to man the engine and the ladders . In two minutes they had their red shirts and helmets on -- they never stirred officially in unofficial costume -- and as the mass meeting overhead smashed through the long row of windows and poured out upon the roof of the arcade , the deliverers were ready for them with a powerful stream of water which washed some of them off the roof and nearly drowned the rest . But water was preferable to fire , and still the stampede from the windows continued , and still the pitiless drenching assailed it until the building was empty ; then the fire - boys mounted to the hall and flooded it with water enough to annihilate forty times as much fire as there was there ; for a village fire - company does not often get a chance to show off , and so when it does get a chance it makes the most of it . Such citizens of that village as were of a thoughtful and judicious temperament did not insure against fire ; they insured against the fire - company . CHAPTER XII . The Shame of Judge Driscoll . Courage is resistance to fear , mastery of fear -- not absence of fear . Except a creature be part coward it is not a compliment to say it is brave ; it is merely a loose misapplication of the word . Consider the flea!--incomparably the bravest of all the creatures of God , if ignorance of fear were courage . Whether you are asleep or awake he will attack you , caring nothing for the fact that in bulk and strength you are to him as are the massed armies of the earth to a sucking child ; he lives both day and night and all days and nights in the very lap of peril and the immediate presence of death , and yet is no more afraid than is the man who walks the streets of a city that was threatened by an earthquake ten centuries before . When we speak of Clive , Nelson , and Putnam as men who "

Judge Driscoll was in bed and asleep by ten o'clock on Friday night , and he was up and gone a - fishing before daylight in the morning with his friend Pembroke Howard . These two had been boys together in Virginia when that State still ranked as the chief and most imposing member of the Union , and they still coupled the proud and affectionate adjective "
30933	31225	31226	31228	the great lawyer"--an	2216	" with her name when they spoke of her . In Missouri a recognized superiority attached to any person who hailed from Old Virginia ; and this superiority was exalted to supremacy when a person of such nativity could also prove descent from the First Families of that great commonwealth . The Howards and Driscolls were of this aristocracy . In their eyes it was a nobility . It had its unwritten laws , and they were as clearly defined and as strict as any that could be found among the printed statutes of the land . The F. F. V. was born a gentleman ; his highest duty in life was to watch over that great inheritance and keep it unsmirched . He must keep his honor spotless . Those laws were his chart ; his course was marked out on it ; if he swerved from it by so much as half a point of the compass it meant shipwreck to his honor ; that is to say , degradation from his rank as a gentleman . These laws required certain things of him which his religion might forbid : then his religion must yield -- the laws could not be relaxed to accommodate religions or anything else . Honor stood first ; and the laws defined what it was and wherein it differed in certain details from honor as defined by church creeds and by the social laws and customs of some of the minor divisions of the globe that had got crowded out when the sacred boundaries of Virginia were staked out . If Judge Driscoll was the recognized first citizen of Dawson 's Landing , Pembroke Howard was easily its recognized second citizen . He was called "
31228	31341	31342	31342	I	0	lawyer"--an earned title . He and Driscoll were of the same age -- a year or two past sixty . Although Driscoll was a free - thinker and Howard a strong and determined Presbyterian , their warm intimacy suffered no impairment in consequence . They were men whose opinions were their own property and not subject to revision and amendment , suggestion or criticism , by anybody , even their friends . The day 's fishing finished , they came floating down stream in their skiff , talking national politics and other high matters , and presently met a skiff coming up from town , with a man in it who said : "
31361	31362	31359	31359	Judge	88	" "
31366	31367	31369	31369	him	777	" "
31373	31406	31369	31369	him	777	" The old Judge 's lips paled , and his eyes began to flame . He choked with anger for a moment , then he got out what he was trying to say-- "
31419	31458	31472	31472	He	777	" The man did it . At the finish the Judge was silent a minute , turning over in his mind the shameful picture of Tom 's flight over the footlights ; then he said , as if musing aloud--"H'm
31493	31514	31490	31490	I	0	" His face lit up with pride and pleasure at that thought , and he said with a cheery complacency , "
31530	31550	31528	31528	Pembroke	78	" Howard smiled an iron smile , and nodded his head approvingly . Then the news - bringer spoke again-- "
31560	31571	31552	31552	Tom	83	" The Judge looked at the man wonderingly , and said-- "
31578	31579	31552	31552	Tom	83	" "
31594	31653	31582	31582	Tom	83	" The old man shrank suddenly together like one who has received a death - stroke . Howard sprang for him as he sank forward in a swoon , and took him in his arms , and bedded him on his back in the boat . He sprinkled water in his face , and said to the startled visitor-- "
31699	31700	31701	31701	I	0	" "
31743	31771	31739	31739	I	0	" He rowed away . Presently the old Judge came out of his faint and looked up piteously into the sympathetic face that was bent over him . "
31787	31807	31808	31808	You	78	" he said in a weak voice . There was nothing weak in the deep organ - tones that responded-- "

31862	31956	31854	31854	Pembroke	78	" Howard stayed by his friend , and saw him home , and entered the house with him . It was dark , and past supper - time , but the Judge was not thinking of supper ; he was eager to hear the slander refuted from headquarters , and as eager to have Howard hear it , too . Tom was sent for , and he came immediately . He was bruised and lame , and was not a happy - looking object . His uncle made him sit down , and said-- "
31996	32001	32002	32002	It	785	" Tom answered guilelessly : "

Howard stood a moment , then sat mournfully down without saying anything . The Judge 's wrath began to kindle , and he burst out-- "

32228	32277	32223	32223	Howard	78	" Tom began to turn sick , and to show it . He turned his hat round and round in his hand , his uncle glowering blacker and blacker upon him as the heavy seconds drifted by ; then at last he began to stammer , and said piteously-- "

At last he said-- "

He went out the back way and wandered down the obscure lane grieving , and wondering if any course of future conduct , however discreet and carefully perfected and watched over , could win back his uncle 's favor and persuade him to reconstruct once more that generous will which had just gone to ruin before his eyes . He finally concluded that it could . He said to himself that he had accomplished this sort of triumph once already , and that what had been done once could be done again . He would set about it . He would bend every energy to the task , and he would score that triumph once more , cost what it might to his convenience , limit as it might his frivolous and liberty - loving life . "

When I reflect upon the number of disagreeable people who I know have gone to a better world , I am moved to lead a different life.--Pudd'nhead Wilson 's Calendar . October . This is one of the peculiarly dangerous months to speculate in stocks in . The others are July , January , September , April , November , May , March , June , December , August , and February.--Pudd'nhead Wilson 's Calendar . Thus mournfully communing with himself Tom moped along the lane past Pudd'nhead Wilson 's house , and still on and on between fences inclosing vacant country on each hand till he neared the haunted house , then he came moping back again , with many sighs and heavy with trouble . He sorely wanted cheerful company . Rowena ! His heart gave a bound at the thought , but the next thought quieted it -- the detested twins would be there . He was on the inhabited side of Wilson 's house , and now as he approached it he noticed that the sitting - room was lighted . This would do ; others made him feel unwelcome sometimes , but Wilson never failed in courtesy toward him , and a kindly courtesy does at least save one 's feelings , even if it is not professing to stand for a welcome . Wilson heard footsteps at his threshold , then the clearing of a throat . "

35486	35745	35748	35748	Howard	78	" The subject seemed about talked out . Nobody seemed to have anything further to offer . After a silence the justice of the peace informed Wilson that he and Buckstone and the constable had come as a committee , on the part of the Democratic party , to ask him to run for mayor -- for the little town was about to become a city and the first charter election was approaching . It was the first attention which Wilson had ever received at the hands of any party ; it was a sufficiently humble one , but it was a recognition of his début into the town 's life and activities at last ; it was a step upward , and he was deeply gratified . He accepted , and the committee departed , followed by young Tom . CHAPTER XIV . Roxana Insists Upon Reform . The true Southern watermelon is a boon apart , and not to be mentioned with commoner things . It is chief of this world 's luxuries , king by the grace of God over all the fruits of the earth . When one has tasted it , he knows what the angels eat . It was not a Southern watermelon that Eve took : we know it because she repented.--Pudd'nhead Wilson 's Calendar . About the time that Wilson was bowing the committee out , Pembroke Howard was entering the next house to report . He found the old Judge sitting grim and straight in his chair , waiting . "

36149	36328	36138	36138	I	0	" He re - drew the will , and his ostensible nephew was heir to a fortune again . As he was finishing his task , Tom , wearied with another brooding tramp , entered the house and went tiptoeing past the sitting - room door . He glanced in , and hurried on , for the sight of his uncle had nothing but terrors for him to - night . But his uncle was writing ! That was unusual at this late hour . What could he be writing ? A chill of anxiety settled down upon Tom 's heart . Did that writing concern him ? He was afraid so . He reflected that when ill luck begins , it does not come in sprinkles , but in showers . He said he would get a glimpse of that document or know the reason why . He heard some one coming , and stepped out of sight and hearing . It was Pembroke Howard . What could be hatching ? Howard said , with great satisfaction : "
36376	36377	36368	36368	We	889	" "
36385	36386	36361	36361	Wilson	86	" "

36434	36455	36425	36425	Pembroke	78	" Pembroke read and witnessed the will , then gave the old man 's hand a hearty shake and said : "

36566	36677	36560	36560	I	0	" The Judge put the will away , and the two started for the battle - ground . In another minute the will was in Tom 's hands . His misery vanished , his feelings underwent a tremendous revulsion . He put the will carefully back in its place , and spread his mouth and swung his hat once , twice , three times around his head , in imitation of three rousing huzzas , no sound issuing from his lips . He fell to communing with himself excitedly and joyously , but every now and then he let off another volley of dumb hurrahs . He said to himself : "
36896	36907	36892	36892	I	0	" He whirled off another dead huzza , and said , "
36922	37033	36915	36915	I	0	" He was about to close with a final grand silent demonstration , when he suddenly recollected that Wilson had put it out of his power to pawn or sell the Indian knife , and that he was once more in awful peril of exposure by his creditors for that reason . His joy collapsed utterly , and he turned away and moped toward the door moaning and lamenting over the bitterness of his luck . He dragged himself up - stairs , and brooded in his room a long time disconsolate and forlorn , with Luigi 's Indian knife for a text . At last he sighed and said : "
37239	37279	37231	37231	I	0	" He allowed the light of the candle to play upon the jewels of the sheath , but the flashings and sparklings had no charm for his eye ; they were only just so many pangs to his heart . "
37291	37295	37280	37280	I	0	" he said , "
37329	37518	37318	37318	she	81	" The thought made him quake , and he hid the knife away , trembling all over and glancing furtively about , like a criminal who fancies that the accuser is already at hand . Should he try to sleep ? Oh , no , sleep was not for him ; his trouble was too haunting , too afflicting for that . He must have somebody to mourn with . He would carry his despair to Roxy . He had heard several distant gunshots , but that sort of thing was not uncommon , and they had made no impression upon him . He went out at the back door , and turned westward . He passed Wilson 's house and proceeded along the lane , and presently saw several figures approaching Wilson 's place through the vacant lots . These were the duelists returning from the fight ; he thought he recognized them , but as he had no desire for white people 's company , he stooped down behind the fence until they were out of his way . Roxy was feeling fine . She said : "

37708	37785	37706	37706	himself	2231	" He laughed at the idea , and went rambling on with a detailed account of his talk with the Judge , and how shocked and ashamed the Judge was to find that he had a coward in his family . He glanced up at last , and got a shock himself . Roxana 's bosom was heaving with suppressed passion , and she was glowering down upon him with measureless contempt written in her face . "
37937	38028	37931	37931	him	914	" The last three sentences stung Tom into a fury , and he said to himself that if his father were only alive and in reach of assassination his mother would soon find that he had a very clear notion of the size of his indebtedness to that man , and was willing to pay it up in full , and would do it too , even at risk of his life ; but he kept this thought to himself ; that was safest in his mother 's present state . "
38171	38257	38169	38169	you	908	" She sat down on her candle - box and fell into a reverie . Tom did not disturb her ; he sometimes lacked prudence , but it was not in circumstances of this kind , Roxana 's storm went gradually down , but it died hard , and even when it seemed to be quite gone , it would now and then break out in a distant rumble , so to speak , in the form of muttered ejaculations . One of these was , "
38287	38292	38166	38167	de nigger	920	" Presently she muttered . "
38304	38370	38166	38167	de nigger	920	" At last her ramblings ceased altogether , and her countenance began to clear -- a welcome sign to Tom , who had learned her moods , and knew she was on the threshold of good - humor , now . He noticed that from time to time she unconsciously carried her finger to the end of her nose . He looked closer and said : "
38388	38430	38431	38431	Dad	98	" She sent out the sort of whole - hearted peal of laughter which God had vouchsafed in its perfection to none but the happy angels in heaven and the bruised and broken black slave on the earth , and said : "

The people took more pride in the duel than in all the other events put together , perhaps . It was a glory to their town to have such a thing happen there . In their eyes the principals had reached the summit of human honor . Everybody paid homage to their names ; their praises were in all mouths . Even the duelists ' subordinates came in for a handsome share of the public approbation : wherefore Pudd'nhead Wilson was suddenly become a man of consequence . When asked to run for the mayoralty Saturday night he was risking defeat , but Sunday morning found him a made man and his success assured . The twins were prodigiously great , now ; the town took them to its bosom with enthusiasm . Day after day , and night after night , they went dining and visiting from house to house , making friends , enlarging and solidifying their popularity , and charming and surprising all with their musical prodigies , and now and then heightening the effects with samples of what they could do in other directions , out of their stock of rare and curious accomplishments . They were so pleased that they gave the regulation thirty days ' notice , the required preparation for citizenship , and resolved to finish their days in this pleasant place . That was the climax . The delighted community rose as one man and applauded ; and when the twins were asked to stand for seats in the forthcoming aldermanic board , and consented , the public contentment was rounded and complete . Tom Driscoll was not happy over these things ; they sunk deep , and hurt all the way down . He hated the one twin for kicking him , and the other one for being the kicker 's brother . Now and then the people wondered why nothing was heard of the raider , or of the stolen knife or the other plunder , but nobody was able to throw any light on that matter . Nearly a week had drifted by , and still the thing remained a vexed mystery . On Saturday Constable Blake and Pudd'nhead Wilson met on the street , and Tom Driscoll joined them in time to open their conversation for them . He said to Blake--"You
40587	40601	40603	40605	a country detective"--which	2373	so?"--which made Blake feel good , and look it ; but Tom added , "

41004	41040	41041	41044	Who got the reward	980	" Blake 's dull face flushed under this gibe , but before he could set his retort in order Tom had turned to Wilson , and was saying , with placid indifference of manner and voice-- "
41048	41062	41041	41044	Who got the reward	980	" Wilson winced slightly , and saw that his own turn was come . "

41084	41101	41041	41044	Who got the reward	980	" Wilson answered -- and rather uncomfortably , to judge by his hesitating fashion of delivering himself-- "
41117	41122	41111	41111	nobody	1501	" Tom seemed surprised . "
41129	41139	41111	41111	nobody	1501	" Wilson showed a trifle of irritation when he replied-- "

41186	41209	41210	41210	Blake	175	" He stopped , and turned to Blake , who was happy now that another had taken his place on the gridiron : "

41354	41361	41338	41338	you	175	" said the constable , pensively , "

41416	41520	41521	41521	She	991	" The constable had n't anything handy to hit back with , so he discharged a discontented sniff , and said nothing . After the night that Wilson had partly revealed his scheme at his house , Tom had tried for several days to guess out the secret of the rest of it , but had failed . Then it occurred to him to give Roxana 's smarter head a chance at it . He made up a supposititious case , and laid it before her . She thought it over , and delivered her verdict upon it . Tom said to himself , "
41528	41549	41550	41550	Wilson	86	" He thought he would test that verdict , now , and watch Wilson 's face ; so he said reflectively-- "
41668	41677	41679	41679	Jackson	187	" Blake slapped his thigh , and cried out-- "

41748	41759	41775	41775	he	428	" He said nothing aloud , and Tom went on : "

41822	41826	41816	41816	he	428	" said Wilson . "

41931	41935	41929	41929	Wilson	86	" said Blake , "
41951	41997	41947	41947	I	0	" Wilson 's blood warmed a little , and he wondered if he had been played upon by those strangers ; it certainly had something of that look . But what could they gain by it ? He threw out that suggestion . Tom replied : "
42169	42172	42163	42163	they	1001	" Blake said-- "
42189	42196	42180	42180	Tom	83	" Tom responded , turning to leave-- "
42220	42278	42279	42279	Blake	175	" Tom sauntered away . Wilson felt a good deal depressed . He hardly knew what to think . He was loath to withdraw his faith from the twins , and was resolved not to do it on the present indecisive evidence ; but -- well , he would think , and then decide how to act . "
42289	42290	42283	42283	you	175	" "
42327	42337	42309	42309	They	1762	" The men parted . Wilson said to himself : "
42371	42597	42363	42363	I	0	" Tom had no purpose in his mind when he encountered those two men . When he began his talk he hoped to be able to gall them a little and get a trifle of malicious entertainment out of it . But when he left , he left in great spirits , for he perceived that just by pure luck and no troublesome labor he had accomplished several delightful things : he had touched both men on a raw spot and seen them squirm ; he had modified Wilson 's sweetness for the twins with one small bitter taste that he would n't be able to get out of his mouth right away ; and , best of all , he had taken the hated twins down a peg with the community ; for Blake would gossip around freely , after the manner of detectives , and within a week the town would be laughing at them in its sleeve for offering a gaudy reward for a bauble which they either never possessed or had n't lost . Tom was very well satisfied with himself . Tom 's behavior at home had been perfect during the entire week . His uncle and aunt had seen nothing like it before . They could find no fault with him anywhere . Saturday evening he said to the Judge-- "

43405	43479	43396	43397	twenty people	1039	" Yes , Tom 's blemishless week had restored him to the favor of his aunt and uncle . His mother was satisfied with him , too . Privately , she believed she was coming to love him , but she did not say so . She told him to go along to St. Louis , now , and she would get ready and follow . Then she smashed her whisky bottle and said-- "
43562	43827	43986	43986	she	1042	" Tom went aboard one of the big transient boats that night with his heavy satchel of miscellaneous plunder , and slept the sleep of the unjust , which is serener and sounder than the other kind , as we know by the hanging - eve history of a million rascals . But when he got up in the morning , luck was against him again : A brother - thief had robbed him while he slept , and gone ashore at some intermediate landing . CHAPTER XVI . Sold Down the River . If you pick up a starving dog and make him prosperous , he will not bite you . This is the principal difference between a dog and a man.--Pudd'nhead Wilson 's Calendar . We know all about the habits of the ant , we know all about the habits of the bee , but we know nothing at all about the habits of the oyster . It seems almost certain that we have been choosing the wrong time for studying the oyster.--Pudd'nhead Wilson 's Calendar . When Roxana arrived , she found her son in such despair and misery that her heart was touched and her motherhood rose up strong in her . He was ruined past hope , now ; his destruction would be immediate and sure , and he would be an outcast and friendless . That was reason enough for a mother to love a child ; so she loved him , and told him so . It made him wince , secretly -- for she was a "
43830	43979	43986	43986	she	1042	" That he was one himself was far from reconciling him to that despised race . Roxana poured out endearments upon him , to which he responded uncomfortably , but as well as he could . And she tried to comfort him , but that was not possible . These intimacies quickly became horrible to him , and within the hour he began to try to get up courage enough to tell her so , and require that they be discontinued or very considerably modified . But he was afraid of her ; and besides , there came a lull , now , for she had begun to think . She was trying to invent a saving plan . Finally she started up , and said she had found a way out . Tom was almost suffocated by the joy of this sudden good news . Roxana said : "
44028	44053	44055	44055	you	0	" Tom was dazed . He was not sure he had heard aright . He was dumb for a moment ; then he said : "

44180	44197	44169	44169	I	0	" Tom 's hopes began to rise , and his spirits along with them . He said-- "

He did not want to commit this treachery , but luck threw the man in his way , and this saved him the necessity of going up country to hunt up a purchaser , with the added risk of having to answer a lot of questions , whereas this planter was so pleased with Roxy that he asked next to none at all . Besides , the planter insisted that Roxy would n't know where she was , at first , and that by the time she found out she would already have become contented . And Tom argued with himself that it was an immense advantage for Roxy to have a master who was so pleased with her , as this planter manifestly was . In almost no time his flowing reasonings carried him to the point of even half believing he was doing Roxy a splendid surreptitious service in selling her "
44645	44658	44431	44431	You	0	" And then he kept diligently saying to himself all the time : "
44688	44729	44675	44675	she	1070	" Yes ; the little deception could do no harm , and everything would come out right and pleasant in the end , any way . By agreement , the conversation in Roxy 's presence was all about the man 's "
44731	45099	45255	45255	God	100	" farm , and how pleasant a place it was , and how happy the slaves were there ; so poor Roxy was entirely deceived ; and easily , for she was not dreaming that her own son could be guilty of treason to a mother who , in voluntarily going into slavery -- slavery of any kind , mild or severe , or of any duration , brief or long -- was making a sacrifice for him compared with which death would have been a poor and commonplace one . She lavished tears and loving caresses upon him privately , and then went away with her owner -- went away broken - hearted , and yet proud of what she was doing , and glad it was in her power to do it . Tom squared his accounts , and resolved to keep to the very letter of his reform , and never to put that will in jeopardy again . He had three hundred dollars left . According to his mother 's plan , he was to put that safely away , and add her half of his pension to it monthly . In one year this fund would buy her free again . For a whole week he was not able to sleep well , so much the villainy which he had played upon his trusting mother preyed upon his rag of a conscience ; but after that he began to get comfortable again , and was presently able to sleep like any other miscreant . The boat bore Roxy away from St. Louis at four in the afternoon , and she stood on the lower guard abaft the paddle - box and watched Tom through a blur of tears until he melted into the throng of people and disappeared ; then she looked no more , but sat there on a coil of cable crying till far into the night . When she went to her foul steerage - bunk at last , between the clashing engines , it was not to sleep , but only to wait for the morning , and , waiting , grieve . It had been imagined that she "
45104	45149	44675	44675	she	1070	" and would think she was traveling up stream . She ! Why , she had been steamboating for years . At dawn she got up and went listlessly and sat down on the cable - coil again . She passed many a snag whose "
45151	45249	44675	44675	she	1070	" could have told her a thing to break her heart , for it showed a current moving in the same direction that the boat was going ; but her thoughts were elsewhere , and she did not notice . But at last the roar of a bigger and nearer break than usual brought her out of her torpor , and she looked up , and her practised eye fell upon that telltale rush of water . For one moment her petrified gaze fixed itself there . Then her head dropped upon her breast , and she said-- "

In Rome , along at first , you are full of regrets that Michelangelo died ; but by and by you only regret that you did n't see him do it.--Pudd'nhead Wilson 's Calendar . July 4 . Statistics show that we lose more fools on this day than in all the other days of the year put together . This proves , by the number left in stock , that one Fourth of July per year is now inadequate , the country has grown so.--Pudd'nhead Wilson 's Calendar . The summer weeks dragged by , and then the political campaign opened -- opened in pretty warm fashion , and waxed hotter and hotter daily . The twins threw themselves into it with their whole heart , for their self - love was engaged . Their popularity , so general at first , had suffered afterward ; mainly because they had been too popular , and so a natural reaction had followed . Besides , it had been diligently whispered around that it was curious -- indeed , very curious -- that that wonderful knife of theirs did not turn up -- if it was so valuable , or if it had ever existed . And with the whisperings went chucklings and nudgings and winks , and such things have an effect . The twins considered that success in the election would reinstate them , and that defeat would work them irreparable damage . Therefore they worked hard , but not harder than Judge Driscoll and Tom worked against them in the closing days of the canvas . Tom 's conduct had remained so letter - perfect during two whole months , now , that his uncle not only trusted him with money with which to persuade voters , but trusted him to go and get it himself out of the safe in the private sitting - room . The closing speech of the campaign was made by Judge Driscoll , and he made it against both of the foreigners . It was disastrously effective . He poured out rivers of ridicule upon them , and forced the big mass - meeting to laugh and applaud . He scoffed at them as adventurers , mountebanks , side - show riff - raff , dime museum freaks ; he assailed their showy titles with measureless derision ; he said they were back - alley barbers disguised as nobilities , peanut peddlers masquerading as gentlemen , organ - grinders bereft of their brother monkey . At last he stopped and stood still . He waited until the place had become absolutely silent and expectant , then he delivered his deadliest shot ; delivered it with ice - cold seriousness and deliberation , with a significant emphasis upon the closing words : he said that he believed that the reward offered for the lost knife was humbug and buncombe , and that its owner would know where to find it whenever he should have occasion to assassinate somebody . Then he stepped from the stand , leaving a startled and impressive hush behind him instead of the customary explosion of cheers and party cries . The strange remark flew far and wide over the town and made an extraordinary sensation . Everybody was asking , "
45847	46363	45842	45842	he	1072	" And everybody went on asking that question , but in vain ; for the Judge only said he knew what he was talking about , and stopped there ; Tom said he had n't any idea what his uncle meant , and Wilson , whenever he was asked what he thought it meant , parried the question by asking the questioner what he thought it meant . Wilson was elected , the twins were defeated -- crushed , in fact , and left forlorn and substantially friendless . Tom went back to St. Louis happy . Dawson 's Landing had a week of repose , now , and it needed it . But it was in an expectant state , for the air was full of rumors of a new duel . Judge Driscoll 's election labors had prostrated him , but it was said that as soon as he was well enough to entertain a challenge he would get one from Count Luigi . The brothers withdrew entirely from society , and nursed their humiliation in privacy . They avoided the people , and went out for exercise only late at night , when the streets were deserted . CHAPTER XVIII . Roxana Commands . Gratitude and treachery are merely the two extremities of the same procession . You have seen all of it that is worth staying for when the band and the gaudy officials have gone by.--Pudd'nhead Wilson 's Calendar . Thanksgiving Day . Let all give humble , hearty , and sincere thanks , now , but the turkeys . In the island of Fiji they do not use turkeys ; they use plumbers . It does not become you and me to sneer at Fiji.--Pudd'nhead Wilson 's Calendar . The Friday after the election was a rainy one in St. Louis . It rained all day long , and rained hard , apparently trying its best to wash that soot - blackened town white , but of course not succeeding . Toward midnight Tom Driscoll arrived at his lodgings from the theatre in the heavy downpour , and closed his umbrella and let himself in ; but when he would have shut the door , he found that there was another person entering -- doubtless another lodger ; this person closed the door and tramped up - stairs behind Tom . Tom found his door in the dark , and entered it and turned up the gas . When he faced about , lightly whistling , he saw the back of a man . The man was closing and locking his door for him . His whistle faded out and he felt uneasy . The man turned around , a wreck of shabby old clothes , sodden with rain and all a - drip , and showed a black face under an old slouch hat . Tom was frightened . He tried to order the man out , but the words refused to come , and the other man got the start . He said , in a low voice-- "
46373	46386	46367	46367	I	0	" Tom sunk in a heap on a chair , and gasped out-- "
46417	46475	46412	46412	I	0	" Roxana stood awhile looking mutely down on him while he writhed in shame and went on incoherently babbling self - accusations mixed with pitiful attempts at explanation and palliation of his crime ; then she seated herself and took off her hat , and her unkept masses of long brown hair tumbled down about her shoulders . "
46490	46499	46500	46500	I	0	" she said sadly , noticing the hair . "
46544	46572	46540	46540	I	0	" Roxana began to cry softly , and presently words began to find their way out between her sobs . They were uttered lamentingly , rather than angrily-- "
46671	46807	46808	46808	Shet	1077	" These words should have touched Tom Driscoll , but if they did , that effect was obliterated by a stronger one -- one which removed the heavy weight of fear which lay upon him , and gave his crushed spirit a most grateful rebound , and filled all his small soul with a deep sense of relief . But he kept prudently still , and ventured no comment . There was a voiceless interval of some duration , now , in which no sounds were heard but the beating of the rain upon the panes , the sighing and complaining of the winds , and now and then a muffled sob from Roxana . The sobs became more and more infrequent , and at last ceased . Then the refugee began to talk again : "
47160	47181	47150	47150	dey	1087	" Tom 's heart was fired -- with fury against the planter 's wife ; and he said to himself , "
47195	47311	47312	47312	He	1098	" He added a deep and bitter curse against her . The expression of this sentiment was fiercely written in his face , and stood thus revealed to Roxana by a white glare of lightning which turned the somber dusk of the room into dazzling day at that moment . She was pleased -- pleased and grateful ; for did not that expression show that her child was capable of grieving for his mother 's wrongs and of feeling resentment toward her persecutors?--a thing which she had been doubting . But her flash of happiness was only a flash , and went out again and left her spirit dark ; for she said to herself , "
47333	47342	47319	47319	he	1098	" Then she took up her tale again . "

Roxy smiled grimly , and said-- "

Wilson went back to his principal and reported the failure of his mission . Luigi was incensed , and asked how it could be that the old gentleman , who was by no means dull - witted , held his trifling nephew 's evidence and inferences to be of more value than Wilson 's . But Wilson laughed , and said-- "

51845	52432	52798	52800	Those old maids	1237	" About eleven at night the twins went out for exercise , and started on a long stroll in the veiled moonlight . Tom Driscoll had landed at Hackett 's Store , two miles below Dawson 's , just about half an hour earlier , the only passenger for that lonely spot , and had walked up the shore road and entered Judge Driscoll 's house without having encountered any one either on the road or under the roof . He pulled down his window - blinds and lighted his candle . He laid off his coat and hat and began his preparations . He unlocked his trunk and got his suit of girl 's clothes out from under the male attire in it , and laid it by . Then he blacked his face with burnt cork and put the cork in his pocket . His plan was , to slip down to his uncle 's private sitting - room below , pass into the bedroom , steal the safe - key from the old gentleman 's clothes , and then go back and rob the safe . He took up his candle to start . His courage and confidence were high , up to this point , but both began to waver a little , now . Suppose he should make a noise , by some accident , and get caught -- say , in the act of opening the safe ? Perhaps it would be well to go armed . He took the Indian knife from its hiding - place , and felt a pleasant return of his wandering courage . He slipped stealthily down the narrow stair , his hair rising and his pulses halting at the slightest creak . When he was half - way down , he was disturbed to perceive that the landing below was touched by a faint glow of light . What could that mean ? Was his uncle still up ? No , that was not likely ; he must have left his night - taper there when he went to bed . Tom crept on down , pausing at every step to listen . He found the door standing open , and glanced in . What he saw pleased him beyond measure . His uncle was asleep on the sofa ; on a small table at the head of the sofa a lamp was burning low , and by it stood the old man 's small tin cash - box , closed . Near the box was a pile of bank - notes and a piece of paper covered with figures in pencil . The safe - door was not open . Evidently the sleeper had wearied himself with work upon his finances , and was taking a rest . Tom set his candle on the stairs , and began to make his way toward the pile of notes , stooping low as he went . When he was passing his uncle , the old man stirred in his sleep , and Tom stopped instantly -- stopped , and softly drew the knife from its sheath , with his heart thumping , and his eyes fastened upon his benefactor 's face . After a moment or two he ventured forward again -- one step -- reached for his prize and seized it , dropping the knife - sheath . Then he felt the old man 's strong grip upon him , and a wild cry of "
52437	52797	52798	52800	Those old maids	1237	" rang in his ear . Without hesitation he drove the knife home -- and was free . Some of the notes escaped from his left hand and fell in the blood on the floor . He dropped the knife and snatched them up and started to fly ; transferred them to his left hand , and seized the knife again , in his fright and confusion , but remembered himself and flung it from him , as being a dangerous witness to carry away with him . He jumped for the stair - foot , and closed the door behind him ; and as he snatched his candle and fled upward , the stillness of the night was broken by the sound of urgent footsteps approaching the house . In another moment he was in his room and the twins were standing aghast over the body of the murdered man ! Tom put on his coat , buttoned his hat under it , threw on his suit of girl 's clothes , dropped the veil , blew out his light , locked the room door by which he had just entered , taking the key , passed through his other door into the back hall , locked that door and kept the key , then worked his way along in the dark and descended the back stairs . He was not expecting to meet anybody , for all interest was centered in the other part of the house , now ; his calculation proved correct . By the time he was passing through the back - yard , Mrs. Pratt , her servants , and a dozen half - dressed neighbors had joined the twins and the dead , and accessions were still arriving at the front door . As Tom , quaking as with a palsy , passed out at the gate , three women came flying from the house on the opposite side of the lane . They rushed by him and in at the gate , asking him what the trouble was there , but not waiting for an answer . Tom said to himself , "
52820	53032	52805	52805	they	1237	" In a few minutes he was in the haunted house . He lighted a candle and took off his girl - clothes . There was blood on him all down his left side , and his right hand was red with the stains of the blood - soaked notes which he had crushed in it ; but otherwise he was free from this sort of evidence . He cleansed his hand on the straw , and cleaned most of the smut from his face . Then he burned his male and female attire to ashes , scattered the ashes , and put on a disguise proper for a tramp . He blew out his light , went below , and was soon loafing down the river road with the intent to borrow and use one of Roxy 's devices . He found a canoe and paddled off down - stream , setting the canoe adrift as dawn approached , and making his way by land to the next village , where he kept out of sight till a transient steamer came along , and then took deck passage for St. Louis . He was ill at ease until Dawson 's Landing was behind him ; then he said to himself , "
53086	53149	53150	53153	One of the twins	1242	" In St. Louis , next morning , he read this brief telegram in the papers -- dated at Dawson 's Landing : Judge Driscoll , an old and respected citizen , was assassinated here about midnight by a profligate Italian nobleman or barber on account of a quarrel growing out of the recent election . The assassin will probably be lynched . "
53155	53159	53150	53153	One of the twins	1242	" soliloquized Tom ; "
53212	53677	53205	53205	I	0	" Tom was now rich and independent . He arranged with the planter , and mailed to Wilson the new bill of sale which sold Roxana to herself ; then he telegraphed his Aunt Pratt : Have seen the awful news in the papers and am almost prostrated with grief . Shall start by packet to - day . Try to bear up till I come . When Wilson reached the house of mourning and had gathered such details as Mrs. Pratt and the rest of the crowd could tell him , he took command as mayor , and gave orders that nothing should be touched , but everything left as it was until Justice Robinson should arrive and take the proper measures as coroner . He cleared everybody out of the room but the twins and himself . The sheriff soon arrived and took the twins away to jail . Wilson told them to keep heart , and promised to do his best in their defense when the case should come to trial . Justice Robinson came presently , and with him Constable Blake . They examined the room thoroughly . They found the knife and the sheath . Wilson noticed that there were finger - prints on the knife - handle . That pleased him , for the twins had required the earliest comers to make a scrutiny of their hands and clothes , and neither these people nor Wilson himself had found any blood - stains upon them . Could there be a possibility that the twins had spoken the truth when they said they found the man dead when they ran into the house in answer to the cry for help ? He thought of that mysterious girl at once . But this was not the sort of work for a girl to be engaged in . No matter ; Tom Driscoll 's room must be examined . After the coroner 's jury had viewed the body and its surroundings , Wilson suggested a search up - stairs , and he went along . The jury forced an entrance to Tom 's room , but found nothing , of course . The coroner 's jury found that the homicide was committed by Luigi , and that Angelo was accessory to it . The town was bitter against the unfortunates , and for the first few days after the murder they were in constant danger of being lynched . The grand jury presently indicted Luigi for murder in the first degree , and Angelo as accessory before the fact . The twins were transferred from the city jail to the county prison to await trial . Wilson examined the finger - marks on the knife - handle and said to himself , "
53686	53999	53678	53681	Neither of the twins	1245	" Then manifestly there was another person concerned , either in his own interest or as hired assassin . But who could it be ? That , he must try to find out . The safe was not open , the cash - box was closed , and had three thousand dollars in it . Then robbery was not the motive , and revenge was . Where had the murdered man an enemy except Luigi ? There was but that one person in the world with a deep grudge against him . The mysterious girl ! The girl was a great trial to Wilson . If the motive had been robbery , the girl might answer ; but there was n't any girl that would want to take this old man 's life for revenge . He had no quarrels with girls ; he was a gentleman . Wilson had perfect tracings of the finger - marks of the knife - handle ; and among his glass - records he had a great array of finger - prints of women and girls , collected during the last fifteen or eighteen years , but he scanned them in vain , they successfully withstood every test ; among them were no duplicates of the prints on the knife . The presence of the knife on the stage of the murder was a worrying circumstance for Wilson . A week previously he had as good as admitted to himself that he believed Luigi had possessed such a knife , and that he still possessed it notwithstanding his pretense that it had been stolen . And now here was the knife , and with it the twins . Half the town had said the twins were humbugging when they claimed that they had lost their knife , and now these people were joyful , and said , "
54005	54701	54703	54703	she	1247	" If their finger - prints had been on the handle -- but it was useless to bother any further about that ; the finger - prints on the handle were not theirs -- that he knew perfectly . Wilson refused to suspect Tom ; for first , Tom could n't murder anybody -- he had n't character enough ; secondly , if he could murder a person he would n't select his doting benefactor and nearest relative ; thirdly , self - interest was in the way ; for while the uncle lived , Tom was sure of a free support and a chance to get the destroyed will revived again , but with the uncle gone , that chance was gone , too . It was true the will had really been revived , as was now discovered , but Tom could not have been aware of it , or he would have spoken of it , in his native talky , unsecretive way . Finally , Tom was in St. Louis when the murder was done , and got the news out of the morning journals , as was shown by his telegram to his aunt . These speculations were unemphasized sensations rather than articulated thoughts , for Wilson would have laughed at the idea of seriously connecting Tom with the murder . Wilson regarded the case of the twins as desperate -- in fact , about hopeless . For he argued that if a confederate was not found , an enlightened Missouri jury would hang them , sure ; if a confederate was found , that would not improve the matter , but simply furnish one more person for the sheriff to hang . Nothing could save the twins but the discovery of a person who did the murder on his sole personal account -- an undertaking which had all the aspect of the impossible . Still , the person who made the finger - prints must be sought . The twins might have no case with him , but they certainly would have none without him . So Wilson mooned around , thinking , thinking , guessing , guessing , day and night , and arriving nowhere . Whenever he ran across a girl or a woman he was not acquainted with , he got her finger - prints , on one pretext or another ; and they always cost him a sigh when he got home , for they never tallied with the finger - marks on the knife - handle . As to the mysterious girl , Tom swore he knew no such girl , and did not remember ever seeing a girl wearing a dress like the one described by Wilson . He admitted that he did not always lock his room , and that sometimes the servants forgot to lock the house doors ; still , in his opinion the girl must have made but few visits or she would have been discovered . When Wilson tried to connect her with the stealing - raid , and thought she might have been the old woman 's confederate , if not the very thief herself disguised as an old woman , Tom seemed stuck , and also much interested , and said he would keep a sharp eye out for this person or persons , although he was afraid that she or they would be too smart to venture again into a town where everybody would now be on the watch for a good while to come . Everybody was pitying Tom , he looked so quiet and sorrowful , and seemed to feel his great loss so deeply . He was playing a part , but it was not all a part . The picture of his alleged uncle , as he had last seen him , was before him in the dark pretty frequently , when he was awake , and called again in his dreams , when he was asleep . He would n't go into the room where the tragedy had happened . This charmed the doting Mrs. Pratt , who realized now , "
54709	54871	54703	54703	she	1247	" she said , what a sensitive and delicate nature her darling had , and how he adored his poor uncle . CHAPTER XX . The Murderer Chuckles . Even the clearest and most perfect circumstantial evidence is likely to be at fault , after all , and therefore ought to be received with great caution . Take the case of any pencil , sharpened by any woman : if you have witnesses , you will find she did it with a knife ; but if you take simply the aspect of the pencil , you will say she did it with her teeth.--Pudd'nhead Wilson 's Calendar . The weeks dragged along , no friend visiting the jailed twins but their counsel and Aunt Patsy Cooper , and the day of trial came at last -- the heaviest day in Wilson 's life ; for with all his tireless diligence he had discovered no sign or trace of the missing confederate . "
54873	55057	55272	55272	I	0	" was the term he had long ago privately accepted for that person -- not as being unquestionably the right term , but as being at least possibly the right one , though he was never able to understand why the twins did not vanish and escape , as the confederate had done , instead of remaining by the murdered man and getting caught there . The court - house was crowded , of course , and would remain so to the finish , for not only in the town itself , but in the country for miles around , the trial was the one topic of conversation among the people . Mrs. Pratt , in deep mourning , and Tom with a weed on his hat , had seats near Pembroke Howard , the public prosecutor , and back of them sat a great array of friends of the family . The twins had but one friend present to keep their counsel in countenance , their poor old sorrowing landlady . She sat near Wilson , and looked her friendliest . In the "
55060	55226	55272	55272	I	0	" sat Chambers ; also Roxy , with good clothes on , and her bill of sale in her pocket . It was her most precious possession , and she never parted with it , day or night . Tom had allowed her thirty - five dollars a month ever since he came into his property , and had said that he and she ought to be grateful to the twins for making them rich ; but had roused such a temper in her by this speech that he did not repeat the argument afterward . She said the old Judge had treated her child a thousand times better than he deserved , and had never done her an unkindness in his life ; so she hated these outlandish devils for killing him , and should n't ever sleep satisfied till she saw them hanged for it . She was here to watch the trial , now , and was going to lift up just one "
55228	55254	55272	55272	I	0	" over it if the County Judge put her in jail a year for it . She gave her turbaned head a toss and said , "
55276	55682	55272	55272	I	0	" Pembroke Howard briefly sketched the State 's case . He said he would show by a chain of circumstantial evidence without break or fault in it anywhere , that the principal prisoner at the bar committed the murder ; that the motive was partly revenge , and partly a desire to take his own life out of jeopardy , and that his brother , by his presence , was a consenting accessory to the crime ; a crime which was the basest known to the calendar of human misdeeds -- assassination ; that it was conceived by the blackest of hearts and consummated by the cowardliest of hands ; a crime which had broken a loving sister 's heart , blighted the happiness of a young nephew who was as dear as a son , brought inconsolable grief to many friends , and sorrow and loss to the whole community . The utmost penalty of the outraged law would be exacted , and upon the accused , now present at the bar , that penalty would unquestionably be executed . He would reserve further remark until his closing speech . He was strongly moved , and so also was the whole house ; Mrs. Pratt and several other women were weeping when he sat down , and many an eye that was full of hate was riveted upon the unhappy prisoners . Witness after witness was called by the State , and questioned at length ; but the cross - questioning was brief . Wilson knew they could furnish nothing valuable for his side . People were sorry for Pudd'nhead ; his budding career would get hurt by this trial . Several witnesses swore they heard Judge Driscoll say in his public speech that the twins would be able to find their lost knife again when they needed it to assassinate somebody with . This was not news , but now it was seen to have been sorrowfully prophetic , and a profound sensation quivered through the hushed court - room when those dismal words were repeated . The public prosecutor rose and said that it was within his knowledge , through a conversation held with Judge Driscoll on the last day of his life , that counsel for the defense had brought him a challenge from the person charged at this bar with murder ; that he had refused to fight with a confessed assassin--"that
55691	55767	55272	55272	I	0	" but had added significantly , that he would be ready for him elsewhere . Presumably the person here charged with murder was warned that he must kill or be killed the first time he should meet Judge Driscoll . If counsel for the defense chose to let the statement stand so , he would not call him to the witness stand . Mr. Wilson said he would offer no denial . [ Murmurs in the house--"It
55778	56328	55774	55774	Wilson	86	" ] Mrs. Pratt testified that she heard no outcry , and did not know what woke her up , unless it was the sound of rapid footsteps approaching the front door . She jumped up and ran out in the hall just as she was , and heard the footsteps flying up the front steps and then following behind her as she ran to the sitting - room . There she found the accused standing over her murdered brother . [ Here she broke down and sobbed . Sensation in the court . ] Resuming , she said the persons entering behind her were Mr. Rogers and Mr. Buckstone . Cross - examined by Wilson , she said the twins proclaimed their innocence ; declared that they had been taking a walk , and had hurried to the house in response to a cry for help which was so loud and strong that they had heard it at a considerable distance ; that they begged her and the gentlemen just mentioned to examine their hands and clothes -- which was done , and no blood stains found . Confirmatory evidence followed from Rogers and Buckstone . The finding of the knife was verified , the advertisement minutely describing it and offering a reward for it was put in evidence , and its exact correspondence with that description proved . Then followed a few minor details , and the case for the State was closed . Wilson said that he had three witnesses , the Misses Clarkson , who would testify that they met a veiled young woman leaving Judge Driscoll 's premises by the back gate a few minutes after the cries for help were heard , and that their evidence , taken with certain circumstantial evidence which he would call the court 's attention to , would in his opinion convince the court that there was still one person concerned in this crime who had not yet been found , and also that a stay of proceedings ought to be granted , in justice to his clients , until that person should be discovered . As it was late , he would ask leave to defer the examination of his three witnesses until the next morning . The crowd poured out of the place and went flocking away in excited groups and couples , talking the events of the session over with vivacity and consuming interest , and everybody seemed to have had a satisfactory and enjoyable day except the accused , their counsel , and their old - lady friend . There was no cheer among these , and no substantial hope . In parting with the twins Aunt Patsy did attempt a good - night with a gay pretense of hope and cheer in it , but broke down without finishing . Absolutely secure as Tom considered himself to be , the opening solemnities of the trial had nevertheless oppressed him with a vague uneasiness , his being a nature sensitive to even the smallest alarms ; but from the moment that the poverty and weakness of Wilson 's case lay exposed to the court , he was comfortable once more , even jubilant . He left the court - room sarcastically sorry for Wilson . "
56340	56344	56346	56346	his	1249	" he said to himself--"that
56404	56435	56397	56397	he	1249	" This reflection set him to admiring , for the hundredth time , the shrewd ingenuities by which he had insured himself against detection -- more , against even suspicion . "
56593	56615	56616	56616	I	0	" The more he thought the situation over , the more the humor of it struck him . Finally he said , "
56681	56857	56678	56678	Pudd'nhead	86	" He wanted to laugh , but that would not have answered ; there were people about , and he was mourning for his uncle . He made up his mind that it would be good entertainment to look in on Wilson that night and watch him worry over his barren law - case and goad him with an exasperating word or two of sympathy and commiseration now and then . Wilson wanted no supper , he had no appetite . He got out all the finger - prints of girls and women in his collection of records and pored gloomily over them an hour or more , trying to convince himself that that troublesome girl 's marks were there somewhere and had been overlooked . But it was not so . He drew back his chair , clasped his hands over his head , and gave himself up to dull and arid musings . Tom Driscoll dropped in , an hour after dark , and said with a pleasant laugh as he took a seat-- "
56880	56900	56678	56678	Pudd'nhead	86	" and he took up one of the glass strips and held it against the light to inspect it . "
56948	56955	56957	56957	you	1265	again,"--and he laid the glass down . "
56964	56965	56957	56957	you	1265	" "
56970	56978	56957	56957	you	1265	" said Wilson , with a sigh , "
57028	57029	57030	57030	I	0	" "
57037	57052	57030	57030	I	0	" and Tom 's countenance darkened , for his memory reverted to his kicking ; "
57104	57115	57090	57090	you	1265	" He took up another strip of glass , and exclaimed-- "
57182	57194	57173	57173	her	81	" and Tom held out the piece of glass to Wilson . "
57199	57207	57173	57173	her	81	" said the bored man , wearily . "
57216	57263	57173	57173	her	81	usually"--and he took the strip of glass indifferently , and raised it toward the lamp . All the blood sunk suddenly out of his face ; his hand quaked , and he gazed at the polished surface before him with the glassy stare of a corpse . "
57282	57302	57173	57173	her	81	" Tom sprang for a glass of water and offered it , but Wilson shrank shuddering from him and said-- "
57309	57342	57343	57343	I	0	" His breast was rising and falling , and he moved his head about in a dull and wandering way , like a person who had been stunned . Presently he said , "

57393	57409	57390	57391	old man	1265	" But as Tom went out he could n't deny himself a small parting gibe : "
57431	57437	57390	57391	old man	1265	" Wilson muttered to himself , "
57460	57538	57447	57447	I	0	" He braced himself up with a glass of cold whisky , and went to work again . He did not compare the new finger - marks unintentionally left by Tom a few minutes before on Roxy 's glass with the tracings of the marks left on the knife - handle , there being no need for that ( for his trained eye ) , but busied himself with another matter , muttering from time to time , "
57561	57631	57544	57545	a girl	2625	" First , he hunted out the plate containing the finger - prints made by Tom when he was twelve years old , and laid it by itself ; then he brought forth the marks made by Tom 's baby fingers when he was a suckling of seven months , and placed these two plates with the one containing this subject 's newly ( and unconsciously ) made record . "
57638	57686	57687	57687	I	0	" he said with satisfaction , and sat down to inspect these things and enjoy them . But his enjoyment was brief . He stared a considerable time at the three strips , and seemed stupefied with astonishment . At last he put them down and said , "
57709	57748	57687	57687	I	0	" He walked the floor for half an hour puzzling over his enigma , then he hunted out two other glass plates . He sat down and puzzled over these things a good while , but kept muttering , "
57807	57868	58344	58344	Pudd'nhead	86	" He was tired out , now , and his brains were beginning to clog . He said he would sleep himself fresh , and then see what he could do with this riddle . He slept through a troubled and unrestful hour , then unconsciousness began to shred away , and presently he rose drowsily to a sitting posture . "
57875	57884	58344	58344	Pudd'nhead	86	" he said , trying to recall it ; "
57894	57922	58344	58344	Pudd'nhead	86	" He landed in the middle of the floor at a bound , without finishing the sentence , and ran and turned up his light and seized his "
57925	57937	58344	58344	Pudd'nhead	86	" He took a single swift glance at them and cried out-- "

This is the day upon which we are reminded of what we are on the other three hundred and sixty - four.--Pudd'nhead Wilson 's Calendar . Wilson put on enough clothes for business purposes and went to work under a high pressure of steam . He was awake all over . All sense of weariness had been swept away by the invigorating refreshment of the great and hopeful discovery which he had made . He made fine and accurate reproductions of a number of his "
58081	58126	58344	58344	Pudd'nhead	86	" and then enlarged them on a scale of ten to one with his pantograph . He did these pantograph enlargements on sheets of white cardboard , and made each individual line of the bewildering maze of whorls or curves or loops which constituted the "
58129	58132	58344	58344	Pudd'nhead	86	" of a "
58134	58317	58344	58344	Pudd'nhead	86	" stand out bold and black by reinforcing it with ink . To the untrained eye the collection of delicate originals made by the human finger on the glass plates looked about alike ; but when enlarged ten times they resembled the markings of a block of wood that has been sawed across the grain , and the dullest eye could detect at a glance , and at a distance of many feet , that no two of the patterns were alike . When Wilson had at last finished his tedious and difficult work , he arranged its results according to a plan in which a progressive order and sequence was a principal feature ; then he added to the batch several pantograph enlargements which he had made from time to time in bygone years . The night was spent and the day well advanced , now . By the time he had snatched a trifle of breakfast it was nine o'clock , and the court was ready to begin its sitting . He was in his place twelve minutes later with his "
58320	58343	58344	58344	Pudd'nhead	86	" Tom Driscoll caught a slight glimpse of the records , and nudged his nearest friend and said , with a wink , "
58383	58424	58344	58344	Pudd'nhead	86	" Wilson was informed that his witnesses had been delayed , but would arrive presently ; but he rose and said he should probably not have occasion to make use of their testimony . [ An amused murmur ran through the room--"It
58438	58441	58344	58344	Pudd'nhead	86	" ] Wilson continued--"I
58537	58606	58607	58607	Wilson	86	" May it please the Court , the claim given the front place , the claim most persistently urged , the claim most strenuously and I may even say aggressively and defiantly insisted upon by the prosecution , is this -- that the person whose hand left the blood - stained finger - prints upon the handle of the Indian knife is the person who committed the murder . "
58630	58636	58619	58619	he	86	" We grant that claim . "
58742	58798	58739	58739	Wilson	86	" We not only grant that claim , but we welcome it and strongly endorse it . Leaving that matter for the present , we will now proceed to consider other points in the case which we propose to establish by evidence , and shall include that one in the chain in its proper place . "
58854	58967	58850	58850	they	1288	" To my mind , certain circumstances of the case before the court seem to suggest a motive for the homicide quite different from the one insisted on by the State . It is my conviction that the motive was not revenge , but robbery . It has been urged that the presence of the accused brothers in that fatal room , just after notification that one of them must take the life of Judge Driscoll or lose his own the moment the parties should meet , clearly signifies that the natural instinct of self - preservation moved my clients to go there secretly and save Count Luigi by destroying his adversary . "
59107	59237	59098	59098	us	1297	" Much stress has been laid upon the fact that the accused offered a very large reward for the knife with which this murder was done ; that no thief came forward to claim that extraordinary reward ; that the latter fact was good circumstantial evidence that the claim that the knife had been stolen was a vanity and a fraud ; that these details taken in connection with the memorable and apparently prophetic speech of the deceased concerning that knife , and the final discovery of that very knife in the fatal room where no living person was found present with the slaughtered man but the owner of the knife and his brother , form an indestructible chain of evidence which fixes the crime upon those unfortunate strangers . "
59492	59528	59484	59488	a man dressed in woman	1315	" Another sensation . Wilson had his eye on Tom when he hazarded this guess , to see what effect it would produce . He was satisfied with the result , and said to himself , "

Every human being carries with him from his cradle to his grave certain physical marks which do not change their character , and by which he can always be identified -- and that without shade of doubt or question . These marks are his signature , his physiological autograph , so to speak , and this autograph can not be counterfeited , nor can he disguise it or hide it away , nor can it become illegible by the wear and mutations of time . This signature is not his face -- age can change that beyond recognition ; it is not his hair , for that can fall out ; it is not his height , for duplicates of that exist ; it is not his form , for duplicates of that exist also , whereas this signature is each man 's very own -- there is no duplicate of it among the swarming populations of the globe ! [ The audience were interested once more . ] "
60355	60495	60500	60501	the assassin	2603	" Wilson stopped and stood silent . Inattention dies a quick and sure death when a speaker does that . The stillness gives warning that something is coming . All palms and finger - balls went down , now , all slouching forms straightened , all heads came up , all eyes were fastened upon Wilson 's face . He waited yet one , two , three moments , to let his pause complete and perfect its spell upon the house ; then , when through the profound hush he could hear the ticking of the clock on the wall , he put out his hand and took the Indian knife by the blade and held it aloft where all could see the sinister spots upon its ivory handle ; then he said , in a level and passionless voice-- "
60541	60553	60555	60555	God	100	sign,"--he paused and raised his eyes to the pendulum swinging back and forth,--"and
60570	60608	60556	60556	we	1347	" Stunned , distraught , unconscious of its own movement , the house half rose , as if expecting to see the murderer appear at the door , and a breeze of muttered ejaculations swept the place . "
60615	60642	60643	60643	He	2328	" This from the sheriff . He was obeyed , and quiet reigned again . Wilson stole a glance at Tom , and said to himself , "
60688	60694	60684	60684	they	1350	" He resumed his speech : "
60883	61044	61045	61045	He	1362	" I have studied some of these signatures so much that I know them as well as the bank cashier knows the autograph of his oldest customer . While I turn my back now , I beg that several persons will be so good as to pass their fingers through their hair , and then press them upon one of the panes of the window near the jury , and that among them the accused may set their finger - marks . Also , I beg that these experimenters , or others , will set their finger - marks upon another pane , and add again the marks of the accused , but not placing them in the same order or relation to the other signatures as before -- for , by one chance in a million , a person might happen upon the right marks by pure guess - work once , therefore I wish to be tested twice .

61107	61162	61163	61163	He	1362	" This is Count Luigi 's right hand ; this one , three signatures below , is his left . Here is Count Angelo 's right ; down here is his left . Now for the other pane : here and here are Count Luigi 's , here and here are his brother 's . "
61167	61172	61095	61095	Wilson	86	" Am I right ? "
61185	61192	61193	61193	Wilson	86	" This certainly approaches the miraculous ! "

We will call the children A and B. Here are A 's finger - marks , taken at the age of five months . Here they are again , taken at seven months . [ Tom started . ] They are alike , you see . Here are B 's at five months , and also at seven months . They , too , exactly copy each other , but the patterns are quite different from A 's , you observe . I shall refer to these again presently , but we will turn them face down , now . "
61572	61606	61607	61608	Your honor	1378	" He passed a powerful magnifying - glass to the foreman . One juryman after another took the cardboard and the glass and made the comparison . Then the foreman said to the judge-- "
61619	61625	61607	61608	Your honor	1378	" Wilson said to the foreman-- "
61665	61676	61677	61677	We	1379	" Again the jury made minute examinations , and again reported-- "
61688	61713	61677	61677	We	1379	" Wilson turned toward the counsel for the prosecution , and there was a clearly recognizable note of warning in his voice when he said-- "
61764	61771	61752	61752	You	1374	" He turned to the jury : "
61793	61831	61752	61752	You	1374	" The comparison began . As it proceeded , all movement and all sound ceased , and the deep silence of an absorbed and waiting suspense settled upon the house ; and when at last the words came-- "
61838	61913	61752	61752	You	1374	" a thunder - crash of applause followed and the house sprang to its feet , but was quickly repressed by official force and brought to order again . Tom was altering his position every few minutes , now , but none of his changes brought repose nor any small trifle of comfort . When the house 's attention was become fixed once more , Wilson said gravely , indicating the twins with a gesture-- "
62011	62015	62008	62008	they	1292	" The foreman responded-- "

62157	62225	62149	62149	somebody	358	" This produced a vast sensation , naturally ; Roxana was astonished at this admirable guess , but not disturbed by it . To guess the exchange was one thing , to guess who did it quite another . Pudd'nhead Wilson could do wonderful things , no doubt , but he could n't do impossible ones . Safe ? She was perfectly safe . She smiled privately . "
62241	62252	62253	62257	the person who did it	1396	cradle"--he made one of his effect - collecting pauses , and added--"and

62428	62432	62425	62425	they	1407	" The foreman answered-- "
62438	62443	62425	62425	they	1407	" Wilson said , solemnly-- "

It was wonderful to find America , but it would have been more wonderful to miss it.--Pudd'nhead Wilson 's Calendar . The town sat up all night to discuss the amazing events of the day and swap guesses as to when Tom 's trial would begin . Troop after troop of citizens came to serenade Wilson , and require a speech , and shout themselves hoarse over every sentence that fell from his lips -- for all his sentences were golden , now , all were marvelous . His long fight against hard luck and prejudice was ended ; he was a made man for good . And as each of these roaring gangs of enthusiasts marched away , some remorseful member of it was quite sure to raise his voice and say-- "

62805	63059	63202	63202	Tom	210	" The twins were heroes of romance , now , and with rehabilitated reputations . But they were weary of Western adventure , and straightway retired to Europe . Roxy 's heart was broken . The young fellow upon whom she had inflicted twenty - three years of slavery continued the false heir 's pension of thirty - five dollars a month to her , but her hurts were too deep for money to heal ; the spirit in her eye was quenched , her martial bearing departed with it , and the voice of her laughter ceased in the land . In her church and its affairs she found her only solace . The real heir suddenly found himself rich and free , but in a most embarrassing situation . He could neither read nor write , and his speech was the basest dialect of the negro quarter . His gait , his attitudes , his gestures , his bearing , his laugh -- all were vulgar and uncouth ; his manners were the manners of a slave . Money and fine clothes could not mend these defects or cover them up ; they only made them the more glaring and the more pathetic . The poor fellow could not endure the terrors of the white man 's parlor , and felt at home and at peace nowhere but in the kitchen . The family pew was a misery to him , yet he could nevermore enter into the solacing refuge of the "
63061	63201	63202	63202	Tom	210	gallery"--that was closed to him for good and all . But we can not follow his curious fate further -- that would be a long story . The false heir made a full confession and was sentenced to imprisonment for life . But now a complication came up . The Percy Driscoll estate was in such a crippled shape when its owner died that it could pay only sixty per cent . of its great indebtedness , and was settled at that rate . But the creditors came forward , now , and complained that inasmuch as through an error for which they were in no way to blame the false heir was not inventoried at the time with the rest of the property , great wrong and loss had thereby been inflicted upon them . They rightly claimed that "
63203	63307	63308	63308	Tom	210	" was lawfully their property and had been so for eight years ; that they had already lost sufficiently in being deprived of his services during that long period , and ought not to be required to add anything to that loss ; that if he had been delivered up to them in the first place , they would have sold him and he could not have murdered Judge Driscoll ; therefore it was not he that had really committed the murder , the guilt lay with the erroneous inventory . Everybody saw that there was reason in this . Everybody granted that if "
63309	63468	63202	63202	Tom	210	" were white and free it would be unquestionably right to punish him -- it would be no loss to anybody ; but to shut up a valuable slave for life -- that was quite another matter . As soon as the Governor understood the case , he pardoned Tom at once , and the creditors sold him down the river . Transcriber 's Notes Introduction : 1 . Background . Welcome to Project Gutenberg 's presentation of Pudd'nhead Wilson . The Italian twins in this novel , Luigi and Angelo , were inspired by a real pair of Italian conjoined twins who toured America in the 1890s . These were Giacomo and Giovanni Battista Tocci . Homer Plessy was arrested for sitting in a whites - only passenger car on June 7 , 1892 , and one month later he stood before Judge John Howard Ferguson to plead his case . Plessy was an octaroon who could easily "
63472	63481	63202	63202	Tom	210	" Four years later , the Supreme Court condoned "
63485	64294	63202	63202	Tom	210	" laws in the famous Plessy vs. Ferguson case , which affirmed the decision of Justice Ferguson in local court . These events in 1892 unfolded as Twain wrote this story , and changed the tale that he ended up telling . Arthur Conan Doyle released his best - selling collection of short stories , The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes , on October 14 , 1892 . The stories had already appeared in The Strand Magazine , one each month , from July 1891 to June 1892 . Holmes inspired Twain to add a component of forensics to this story . 2 . Dialect . The soliloquies and conversations in the novel follow some general rules . Twain introduced some variations in the spelling of dialect , and sometimes the sound of dialect , but the end meaning seems to be the same thing . Below is a table of some of these words , and alternatives found in the text : Dialect used in Pudd'nhead Wilson English Dialect , Alternative , Another and en against agin , ag'in , ag'in ' because ' ca'se going gwine , gwyne more mo ' that dat the de then den there dere , dah these dese they dey , deh this dis was ' uz with wid where whah The above table was presented as a foundation which played into the decision to make some emendations , below , that were not authorized by Twain in 1899 . One curious notation is that there was sometimes pronounced dere , but also dah . Along the same lines , they most often became dey , but in one case , deh . 3 . This version . Our version is based on the 1894 publication of this novel in Hartford . This was Twain 's original American release of the novel in book form . A scanned copy of this book is available through Hathitrust . The book contained some spaces in contractions : I 'll , dat 'll , had n't , could n't , dis 'll , ' t ai n't / t ai n't , and dey 'll are some examples . These spaces were not retained in our transcription , and are not identified . We did make a few other emendations . These emendations were checked with the 1899 version of Pudd'nhead Wilson published by Harper & amp ; Brothers . 4 . Notes on emendations . The errors on Page 233 and Page 288 , were not changed in the 1899 book , so the case for making those changes may be found in the Detailed Notes section . The remaining errors were corrected in the 1899 publication , presumably authorized by Twain , who essentially made the case for those emendations . In the HTML version of this e - book , you can place your cursor over the faint silver dotted lines below the changed text to discover the original text . The Detailed Notes section of these notes describe these emendations . 5 . Other versions . Please note that many print versions of Pudd'nhead Wilson include the phrase ' spelling and usage have been brought into conformity with modern usage , ' and editors have been liberal with their renditions of Twain 's story . 6 . Detailed notes . The Detailed Notes Section also includes issues that have come up during transcription . One common issue is that words are sometimes split into two lines for spacing purposes in the original text . These words are hyphenated in the physical book , but there is a question sometimes as to whether the hyphen should be retained in transcription . The reasons behind some of these decisions are itemized . Production Notes Section : 1 . Chapter Titles . The Chapter Titles , such as Doom in Chapter XXI . , were not part of Twain 's book . They remain from another version of this book . The chapter titles are used in PG 's Mark Twain index , so we have retained them . 2 . The Author 's Note . The Author 's Note to Those Extraordinary Twins is actually the author 's introduction to the novella , Those Extraordinary Twins . Twain originally produced this book with two parts : Pudd'nhead Wilson and Those Extraordinary Twins . Project Gutenberg offers both stories , so we present the Author 's Note as the Introduction to Those Extraordinary Twins , as Twain intended . If you want to read the Author 's Note , please visit the Introduction of our production of the novella , Those Extraordinary Twins . Detailed Notes Section : Chapter 1 . On Page 19 , barber - shop was hyphenated between two lines for spacing . The 1899 Harper & amp ; Brothers version used "
64297	64358	64365	64365	mine	1416	" in this spot . Even though barber - shop can not be transcribed as such , the assumption is that the 1894 version put in the hyphen by mistake . We transcribed the word barber shop . Chapter 2 . On Page 34 , changed ca'se to ' ca'se , used as dialect for because , in the clause : "
64367	64414	64415	64416	The twins	1762	" The author used ' ca'se eighteen other times as dialect for because , and did not use ca'se again . Chapter 3 . On Page 43 , insert missing period after tomb . Chapter 6 . On Page 81 , add a comma after door : "
64437	64525	64423	64424	the widow	1721	" Chapter 7 . On Page 88 , add a period after fault in the sentence : The Judge laid himself out hospitably to make them have a good time , and if there was a defect anywhere it was not his fault . Chapter 9 . On Page 114 , there is a word missing before the semicolon in the clause : Tom sprang up and seized a billet of wood and raised ; the 1899 Harper & amp ; Brothers version provided the missing word , "
64528	64564	64423	64424	the widow	1721	" Chapter 11 . On Page 131 , change dicision to decision in the clause : Luigi reserved his dicision . On Page 133 , change comma to a period after years in the sentence : "
64612	64656	64423	64424	the widow	1721	" On Page 149 , Correct spelling of Cappello to Capello . The surname of the twins was Capello in the letter on page 73 , and two other times in Chapter 6 . Chapter 13 . On Page 167 , Change ' to "
64661	64896	64423	64424	the widow	1721	" Why , my boy , you look desolate . Do n't take it so hard . Try and forget you have been kicked . ' On Page 176 , ship - shape was hyphenated and split between two lines for spacing . The 1899 Harper & amp ; Brothers version of the novel used shipshape , and so will we . Chapter 14 . On Page 182 , changed period after hatching to question mark in the sentence : What could be hatching . On Page 184 , remove comma after sha'n't , in the clause : but if he does n't , I sha'n't , let on . On Page 189 , low - down is hyphenated and split between two lines for spacing . On Page 188 , low - down is spelled with a hyphen , and on pages 241 and 243 low - downest is also hyphenated . There is no occurrence of lowdown . We transcribed low - down with a hyphen : like a ornery low - down hound ! Chapter 16 . On Page 216 , Changed ? to ! in the sentence : En keep on sayin ' it ? Chapter 18 . On Page 229 , Changed ' against to against in the clause : with fury ' against the planter 's wife . On Page 233 , Changed de to den in the clause "
64903	65086	64423	64424	the widow	1721	" The author always used den for then , except in this case . De is dialect for the . Twain did not correct this in the 1899 Harper & amp ; Brothers version of the novel , but den makes more sense then de . Roxy was floating on the river , and then she cried good gracious me , because she spotted the Grand Mogul . Changed day to dey in two places . The novel used dey as dialect for they regularly , and almost consistently , except in two cases . Both cases were presumed errata : • On Page 232 , en day warn't gwine to hurry • On Page 229 , en day knows how to whale 'em , too . Chapter 19 . On Page 253 , back - yard is hyphenated and split between two lines for spacing . The 1899 Harper & amp ; Brothers version of the novel used back - yard , and so will we . Chapter 20 . On Page 273 , changed countenence to countenance in the clause : "
65094	65210	65087	65087	I	0	" and Tom 's countenence darkened , ... Chapter 21 . On Page 288 , there are two quotes made by the crowd in double quotes . Twain did not correct this in the 1899 version of the novel by Harper & amp ; Brothers . But these lines are surrounded by Wilson 's narrative , which is already in double quotes . Therefore , we have used single quotes for the two remarks from the gallery . • ' Why , it 's so -- I never noticed that before ! ' • ' Why , that 's so , too ! ' Conclusion . On Page 302 , removed in from the sentence : "
