1	980	999	999	he	616	’S PREFACE This story was begun , within a few months after the publication of the completed “ Pickwick Papers . ” There were , then , a good many cheap Yorkshire schools in existence . There are very few now . Of the monstrous neglect of education in England , and the disregard of it by the State as a means of forming good or bad citizens , and miserable or happy men , private schools long afforded a notable example . Although any man who had proved his unfitness for any other occupation in life , was free , without examination or qualification , to open a school anywhere ; although preparation for the functions he undertook , was required in the surgeon who assisted to bring a boy into the world , or might one day assist , perhaps , to send him out of it ; in the chemist , the attorney , the butcher , the baker , the candlestick maker ; the whole round of crafts and trades , the schoolmaster excepted ; and although schoolmasters , as a race , were the blockheads and impostors who might naturally be expected to spring from such a state of things , and to flourish in it ; these Yorkshire schoolmasters were the lowest and most rotten round in the whole ladder . Traders in the avarice , indifference , or imbecility of parents , and the helplessness of children ; ignorant , sordid , brutal men , to whom few considerate persons would have entrusted the board and lodging of a horse or a dog ; they formed the worthy cornerstone of a structure , which , for absurdity and a magnificent high - minded LAISSEZ - ALLER neglect , has rarely been exceeded in the world . We hear sometimes of an action for damages against the unqualified medical practitioner , who has deformed a broken limb in pretending to heal it . But , what of the hundreds of thousands of minds that have been deformed for ever by the incapable pettifoggers who have pretended to form them ! I make mention of the race , as of the Yorkshire schoolmasters , in the past tense . Though it has not yet finally disappeared , it is dwindling daily . A long day ’s work remains to be done about us in the way of education , Heaven knows ; but great improvements and facilities towards the attainment of a good one , have been furnished , of late years . I can not call to mind , now , how I came to hear about Yorkshire schools when I was a not very robust child , sitting in bye - places near Rochester Castle , with a head full of PARTRIDGE , STRAP , TOM PIPES , and SANCHO PANZA ; but I know that my first impressions of them were picked up at that time , and that they were somehow or other connected with a suppurated abscess that some boy had come home with , in consequence of his Yorkshire guide , philosopher , and friend , having ripped it open with an inky pen - knife . The impression made upon me , however made , never left me . I was always curious about Yorkshire schools -- fell , long afterwards and at sundry times , into the way of hearing more about them -- at last , having an audience , resolved to write about them . With that intent I went down into Yorkshire before I began this book , in very severe winter time which is pretty faithfully described herein . As I wanted to see a schoolmaster or two , and was forewarned that those gentlemen might , in their modesty , be shy of receiving a visit from the author of the “ Pickwick Papers , ” I consulted with a professional friend who had a Yorkshire connexion , and with whom I concerted a pious fraud . He gave me some letters of introduction , in the name , I think , of my travelling companion ; they bore reference to a supposititious little boy who had been left with a widowed mother who did n’t know what to do with him ; the poor lady had thought , as a means of thawing the tardy compassion of her relations in his behalf , of sending him to a Yorkshire school ; I was the poor lady ’s friend , travelling that way ; and if the recipient of the letter could inform me of a school in his neighbourhood , the writer would be very much obliged . I went to several places in that part of the country where I understood the schools to be most plentifully sprinkled , and had no occasion to deliver a letter until I came to a certain town which shall be nameless . The person to whom it was addressed , was not at home ; but he came down at night , through the snow , to the inn where I was staying . It was after dinner ; and he needed little persuasion to sit down by the fire in a warm corner , and take his share of the wine that was on the table . I am afraid he is dead now . I recollect he was a jovial , ruddy , broad - faced man ; that we got acquainted directly ; and that we talked on all kinds of subjects , except the school , which he showed a great anxiety to avoid . “ Was there any large school near ? ” I asked him , in reference to the letter . “ Oh yes , ” he said ; “ there was a pratty big ‘
1013	1157	999	999	he	616	’ a matther of opinion ” ; and fell to looking at the fire , staring round the room , and whistling a little . On my reverting to some other topic that we had been discussing , he recovered immediately ; but , though I tried him again and again , I never approached the question of the school , even if he were in the middle of a laugh , without observing that his countenance fell , and that he became uncomfortable . At last , when we had passed a couple of hours or so , very agreeably , he suddenly took up his hat , and leaning over the table and looking me full in the face , said , in a low voice : “ Weel , Misther , we ’ve been vara pleasant toogather , and ar’ll spak ’
1173	1188	999	999	he	616	’ our school - measthers , while there ’s a harse to hoold in a ’
1203	1219	999	999	he	616	’ ill words amang my neeburs , and ar speak tiv’ee quiet loike . But I ’m
1235	1244	1012	1017	a ’ a matther of opinion	8425	’ , to keep the lattle boy from a ’
1256	2479	1012	1017	a ’ a matther of opinion	8425	’ Lunnun , or a gootther to lie asleep in ! ” Repeating these words with great heartiness , and with a solemnity on his jolly face that made it look twice as large as before , he shook hands and went away . I never saw him afterwards , but I sometimes imagine that I descry a faint reflection of him in John Browdie . In reference to these gentry , I may here quote a few words from the original preface to this book . “ It has afforded the Author great amusement and satisfaction , during the progress of this work , to learn , from country friends and from a variety of ludicrous statements concerning himself in provincial newspapers , that more than one Yorkshire schoolmaster lays claim to being the original of Mr. Squeers . One worthy , he has reason to believe , has actually consulted authorities learned in the law , as to his having good grounds on which to rest an action for libel ; another , has meditated a journey to London , for the express purpose of committing an assault and battery on his traducer ; a third , perfectly remembers being waited on , last January twelve - month , by two gentlemen , one of whom held him in conversation while the other took his likeness ; and , although Mr. Squeers has but one eye , and he has two , and the published sketch does not resemble him ( whoever he may be ) in any other respect , still he and all his friends and neighbours know at once for whom it is meant , because -- the character is SO like him . “ While the Author can not but feel the full force of the compliment thus conveyed to him , he ventures to suggest that these contentions may arise from the fact , that Mr. Squeers is the representative of a class , and not of an individual . Where imposture , ignorance , and brutal cupidity , are the stock in trade of a small body of men , and one is described by these characteristics , all his fellows will recognise something belonging to themselves , and each will have a misgiving that the portrait is his own . “ The Author ’s object in calling public attention to the system would be very imperfectly fulfilled , if he did not state now , in his own person , emphatically and earnestly , that Mr. Squeers and his school are faint and feeble pictures of an existing reality , purposely subdued and kept down lest they should be deemed impossible . That there are , upon record , trials at law in which damages have been sought as a poor recompense for lasting agonies and disfigurements inflicted upon children by the treatment of the master in these places , involving such offensive and foul details of neglect , cruelty , and disease , as no writer of fiction would have the boldness to imagine . And that , since he has been engaged upon these Adventures , he has received , from private quarters far beyond the reach of suspicion or distrust , accounts of atrocities , in the perpetration of which upon neglected or repudiated children , these schools have been the main instruments , very far exceeding any that appear in these pages . ” This comprises all I need say on the subject ; except that if I had seen occasion , I had resolved to reprint a few of these details of legal proceedings , from certain old newspapers . One other quotation from the same Preface may serve to introduce a fact that my readers may think curious . “ To turn to a more pleasant subject , it may be right to say , that there ARE two characters in this book which are drawn from life . It is remarkable that what we call the world , which is so very credulous in what professes to be true , is most incredulous in what professes to be imaginary ; and that , while , every day in real life , it will allow in one man no blemishes , and in another no virtues , it will seldom admit a very strongly - marked character , either good or bad , in a fictitious narrative , to be within the limits of probability . But those who take an interest in this tale , will be glad to learn that the BROTHERS CHEERYBLE live ; that their liberal charity , their singleness of heart , their noble nature , and their unbounded benevolence , are no creations of the Author ’s brain ; but are prompting every day ( and oftenest by stealth ) some munificent and generous deed in that town of which they are the pride and honour . ” If I were to attempt to sum up the thousands of letters , from all sorts of people in all sorts of latitudes and climates , which this unlucky paragraph brought down upon me , I should get into an arithmetical difficulty from which I could not easily extricate myself . Suffice it to say , that I believe the applications for loans , gifts , and offices of profit that I have been requested to forward to the originals of the BROTHERS CHEERYBLE ( with whom I never interchanged any communication in my life ) would have exhausted the combined patronage of all the Lord Chancellors since the accession of the House of Brunswick , and would have broken the Rest of the Bank of England . The Brothers are now dead . There is only one other point , on which I would desire to offer a remark . If Nicholas be not always found to be blameless or agreeable , he is not always intended to appear so . He is a young man of an impetuous temper and of little or no experience ; and I saw no reason why such a hero should be lifted out of nature . CHAPTER 1 Introduces all the Rest There once lived , in a sequestered part of the county of Devonshire , one Mr. Godfrey Nickleby : a worthy gentleman , who , taking it into his head rather late in life that he must get married , and not being young enough or rich enough to aspire to the hand of a lady of fortune , had wedded an old flame out of mere attachment , who in her turn had taken him for the same reason . Thus two people who can not afford to play cards for money , sometimes sit down to a quiet game for love . Some ill - conditioned persons who sneer at the life - matrimonial , may perhaps suggest , in this place , that the good couple would be better likened to two principals in a sparring match , who , when fortune is low and backers scarce , will chivalrously set to , for the mere pleasure of the buffeting ; and in one respect indeed this comparison would hold good ; for , as the adventurous pair of the Fives ’
3361	3364	3366	3366	Ralph	208	‘ And , ’
3370	3466	3366	3366	Ralph	208	‘ if no good came of my uncle ’s money when he was alive , a great deal of good came of it after he was dead , inasmuch as my father has got it now , and is saving it up for me , which is a highly virtuous purpose ; and , going back to the old gentleman , good DID come of it to him too , for he had the pleasure of thinking of it all his life long , and of being envied and courted by all his family besides . ’
3596	3606	3565	3565	he	208	‘ two - pence for every half - penny , ’
4194	4245	4192	4193	young ladies	701	’ ages being , before the passing of the new act , nowhere preserved in the registries of this country -- Mr Nickleby looked about him for the means of repairing his capital , now sadly reduced by this increase in his family , and the expenses of their education . ‘
4250	4255	4192	4193	young ladies	701	’ said Mrs. Nickleby . ‘
4265	4275	4192	4193	young ladies	701	’ said Mr. Nickleby , as though in doubt . ‘
4279	4284	4192	4193	young ladies	701	’ asked Mrs. Nickleby . ‘
4296	4311	4192	4193	young ladies	701	’ rejoined Mr. Nickleby , who was a slow and time - taking speaker , ‘
4330	4331	4332	4332	Fiddle	209	’ ‘
4334	4339	4332	4332	Fiddle	209	’ said Mrs. Nickleby . ‘
4351	4356	4332	4332	Fiddle	209	’ said Mr. Nickleby . ‘
4361	4366	4368	4370	a young man	706	’ pursued the lady , ‘
4418	4419	4413	4413	he	709	’ ‘
4424	4429	4413	4413	he	709	’ replied Mr. Nickleby . ‘
4445	4514	4438	4438	I	0	’ Speculation is a round game ; the players see little or nothing of their cards at first starting ; gains MAY be great -- and so may losses . The run of luck went against Mr. Nickleby . A mania prevailed , a bubble burst , four stock - brokers took villa residences at Florence , four hundred nobodies were ruined , and among them Mr. Nickleby . ‘
4522	4528	4438	4438	I	0	’ sighed the poor gentleman , ‘
4551	4579	4549	4549	strangers	713	’ The last reflection hurt him so much , that he took at once to his bed ; apparently resolved to keep that , at all events . ‘
4585	4590	4549	4549	strangers	713	’ said the apothecary . ‘
4602	4607	4591	4591	You	714	’ said the nurse . ‘
4614	4619	4591	4591	You	714	’ remarked the lawyer . ‘
4630	4635	4591	4591	You	714	’ whispered the clergyman . ‘
4647	4944	4591	4591	You	714	’ added the neighbours . Mr. Nickleby shook his head , and motioning them all out of the room , embraced his wife and children , and having pressed them by turns to his languidly beating heart , sunk exhausted on his pillow . They were concerned to find that his reason went astray after this ; for he babbled , for a long time , about the generosity and goodness of his brother , and the merry old times when they were at school together . This fit of wandering past , he solemnly commended them to One who never deserted the widow or her fatherless children , and , smiling gently on them , turned upon his face , and observed , that he thought he could fall asleep . CHAPTER 2 Of Mr. Ralph Nickleby , and his Establishments , and his Undertakings , and of a great Joint Stock Company of vast national Importance Mr. Ralph Nickleby was not , strictly speaking , what you would call a merchant , neither was he a banker , nor an attorney , nor a special pleader , nor a notary . He was certainly not a tradesman , and still less could he lay any claim to the title of a professional gentleman ; for it would have been impossible to mention any recognised profession to which he belonged . Nevertheless , as he lived in a spacious house in Golden Square , which , in addition to a brass plate upon the street - door , had another brass plate two sizes and a half smaller upon the left hand door - post , surrounding a brass model of an infant ’s fist grasping a fragment of a skewer , and displaying the word ‘
4947	5890	4591	4591	You	714	’ it was clear that Mr. Ralph Nickleby did , or pretended to do , business of some kind ; and the fact , if it required any further circumstantial evidence , was abundantly demonstrated by the diurnal attendance , between the hours of half - past nine and five , of a sallow - faced man in rusty brown , who sat upon an uncommonly hard stool in a species of butler ’s pantry at the end of the passage , and always had a pen behind his ear when he answered the bell . Although a few members of the graver professions live about Golden Square , it is not exactly in anybody ’s way to or from anywhere . It is one of the squares that have been ; a quarter of the town that has gone down in the world , and taken to letting lodgings . Many of its first and second floors are let , furnished , to single gentlemen ; and it takes boarders besides . It is a great resort of foreigners . The dark - complexioned men who wear large rings , and heavy watch - guards , and bushy whiskers , and who congregate under the Opera Colonnade , and about the box - office in the season , between four and five in the afternoon , when they give away the orders,--all live in Golden Square , or within a street of it . Two or three violins and a wind instrument from the Opera band reside within its precincts . Its boarding - houses are musical , and the notes of pianos and harps float in the evening time round the head of the mournful statue , the guardian genius of a little wilderness of shrubs , in the centre of the square . On a summer ’s night , windows are thrown open , and groups of swarthy moustached men are seen by the passer - by , lounging at the casements , and smoking fearfully . Sounds of gruff voices practising vocal music invade the evening ’s silence ; and the fumes of choice tobacco scent the air . There , snuff and cigars , and German pipes and flutes , and violins and violoncellos , divide the supremacy between them . It is the region of song and smoke . Street bands are on their mettle in Golden Square ; and itinerant glee - singers quaver involuntarily as they raise their voices within its boundaries . This would not seem a spot very well adapted to the transaction of business ; but Mr. Ralph Nickleby had lived there , notwithstanding , for many years , and uttered no complaint on that score . He knew nobody round about , and nobody knew him , although he enjoyed the reputation of being immensely rich . The tradesmen held that he was a sort of lawyer , and the other neighbours opined that he was a kind of general agent ; both of which guesses were as correct and definite as guesses about other people ’s affairs usually are , or need to be . Mr. Ralph Nickleby sat in his private office one morning , ready dressed to walk abroad . He wore a bottle - green spencer over a blue coat ; a white waistcoat , grey mixture pantaloons , and Wellington boots drawn over them . The corner of a small - plaited shirt - frill struggled out , as if insisting to show itself , from between his chin and the top button of his spencer ; and the latter garment was not made low enough to conceal a long gold watch - chain , composed of a series of plain rings , which had its beginning at the handle of a gold repeater in Mr. Nickleby ’s pocket , and its termination in two little keys : one belonging to the watch itself , and the other to some patent padlock . He wore a sprinkling of powder upon his head , as if to make himself look benevolent ; but if that were his purpose , he would perhaps have done better to powder his countenance also , for there was something in its very wrinkles , and in his cold restless eye , which seemed to tell of cunning that would announce itself in spite of him . However this might be , there he was ; and as he was all alone , neither the powder , nor the wrinkles , nor the eyes , had the smallest effect , good or bad , upon anybody just then , and are consequently no business of ours just now . Mr. Nickleby closed an account - book which lay on his desk , and , throwing himself back in his chair , gazed with an air of abstraction through the dirty window . Some London houses have a melancholy little plot of ground behind them , usually fenced in by four high whitewashed walls , and frowned upon by stacks of chimneys : in which there withers on , from year to year , a crippled tree , that makes a show of putting forth a few leaves late in autumn when other trees shed theirs , and , drooping in the effort , lingers on , all crackled and smoke - dried , till the following season , when it repeats the same process , and perhaps , if the weather be particularly genial , even tempts some rheumatic sparrow to chirrup in its branches . People sometimes call these dark yards ‘
5892	6027	4591	4591	You	714	’ ; it is not supposed that they were ever planted , but rather that they are pieces of unreclaimed land , with the withered vegetation of the original brick - field . No man thinks of walking in this desolate place , or of turning it to any account . A few hampers , half - a - dozen broken bottles , and such - like rubbish , may be thrown there , when the tenant first moves in , but nothing more ; and there they remain until he goes away again : the damp straw taking just as long to moulder as it thinks proper : and mingling with the scanty box , and stunted everbrowns , and broken flower - pots , that are scattered mournfully about -- a prey to ‘
6029	6300	4591	4591	You	714	’ and dirt . It was into a place of this kind that Mr. Ralph Nickleby gazed , as he sat with his hands in his pockets looking out of the window . He had fixed his eyes upon a distorted fir tree , planted by some former tenant in a tub that had once been green , and left there , years before , to rot away piecemeal . There was nothing very inviting in the object , but Mr Nickleby was wrapt in a brown study , and sat contemplating it with far greater attention than , in a more conscious mood , he would have deigned to bestow upon the rarest exotic . At length , his eyes wandered to a little dirty window on the left , through which the face of the clerk was dimly visible ; that worthy chancing to look up , he beckoned him to attend . In obedience to this summons the clerk got off the high stool ( to which he had communicated a high polish by countless gettings off and on ) , and presented himself in Mr. Nickleby ’s room . He was a tall man of middle age , with two goggle eyes whereof one was a fixture , a rubicund nose , a cadaverous face , and a suit of clothes ( if the term be allowable when they suited him not at all ) much the worse for wear , very much too small , and placed upon such a short allowance of buttons that it was marvellous how he contrived to keep them on . ‘
6310	6322	6308	6308	Noggs	211	’ said Mr. Nickleby , in a sharp and grating voice . ‘
6334	6350	4591	4591	You	714	’ Noggs was going to add public - house clock , but recollecting himself , substituted ‘
6354	6355	6356	6356	My	0	’ ‘
6361	6366	6356	6356	My	0	’ said Mr. Nickleby ; ‘
6375	6376	4591	4591	You	714	’ ‘
6381	6385	4591	4591	You	714	’ said Noggs . ‘
6390	6395	4591	4591	You	714	’ said Mr. Nickleby . ‘
6401	6405	4591	4591	You	714	’ rejoined Noggs . ‘
6413	6418	4591	4591	You	714	’ observed Mr. Nickleby . ‘
6422	6426	4591	4591	You	714	’ said Noggs . ‘
6429	6442	4591	4591	You	714	’ said Mr. Nickleby , putting the repeater back in his pocket ; ‘
6447	6591	4591	4591	You	714	’ Noggs gave a peculiar grunt , as was his custom at the end of all disputes with his master , to imply that he ( Noggs ) triumphed ; and ( as he rarely spoke to anybody unless somebody spoke to him ) fell into a grim silence , and rubbed his hands slowly over each other : cracking the joints of his fingers , and squeezing them into all possible distortions . The incessant performance of this routine on every occasion , and the communication of a fixed and rigid look to his unaffected eye , so as to make it uniform with the other , and to render it impossible for anybody to determine where or at what he was looking , were two among the numerous peculiarities of Mr. Noggs , which struck an inexperienced observer at first sight . ‘
6602	6607	6592	6592	I	0	’ said Mr. Nickleby . ‘
6611	6619	6592	6592	I	0	’ inquired Noggs . Mr. Nickleby nodded . ‘
6690	6726	6769	6769	him	725	’ Noggs nodded ; and as he nodded , there came a ring at the office bell . The master looked up from his papers , and the clerk calmly remained in a stationary position . ‘
6730	6739	6769	6769	him	725	’ said Noggs , as though in explanation . ‘
6743	6744	6769	6769	him	725	’ ‘
6747	6748	6769	6769	him	725	’ ‘
6752	6753	6769	6769	him	725	’ ‘
6756	6757	6769	6769	him	725	’ ‘
6764	6765	6769	6769	him	725	’ ‘
6773	6787	6769	6769	him	725	’ Noggs gave vent to his usual grunt , as much as to say ‘
6792	6873	6788	6788	I	0	’ and , the ring being repeated , went to the door , whence he presently returned , ushering in , by the name of Mr. Bonney , a pale gentleman in a violent hurry , who , with his hair standing up in great disorder all over his head , and a very narrow white cravat tied loosely round his throat , looked as if he had been knocked up in the night and had not dressed himself since . ‘
6878	6903	6788	6788	I	0	’ said the gentleman , taking off a white hat which was so full of papers that it would scarcely stick upon his head , ‘
7015	7016	7007	7007	he	730	’ ‘
7024	7046	7007	7007	he	730	’ said Mr. Ralph Nickleby , whose deliberate manner was strongly opposed to the vivacity of the other man of business . ‘
7050	7055	7007	7007	he	730	’ echoed Mr. Bonney . ‘
7112	7113	7181	7184	a VERY remarkable man	732	’ ‘
7122	7130	7181	7184	a VERY remarkable man	732	’ said Mr. Ralph Nickleby , smiling . ‘
7160	7173	7135	7135	you	208	’ said Mr. Bonney , slapping the capitalist familiarly on the shoulder . ‘
7191	7192	7195	7196	poor devil	734	’ ‘
7198	7207	7195	7196	poor devil	734	’ replied Ralph , drawing on his gloves . ‘
7218	7219	7209	7210	Newman Noggs	211	’ ‘
7224	7230	7209	7210	Newman Noggs	211	’ said the other carelessly . ‘
7233	7237	7209	7210	Newman Noggs	211	’ continued Ralph , ‘
7303	7304	7301	7301	I	0	’ ‘
7310	7319	7301	7301	I	0	’ said Mr. Bonney with a meaning look . ‘
7323	7327	7301	7301	I	0	’ replied Ralph ; ‘
7337	7338	7328	7328	I	0	’ ‘
7345	7346	7328	7328	I	0	’ ‘
7389	7400	7380	7380	He	211	’ said Mr. Nickleby , calling up a charitable look , ‘
7413	7696	7386	7386	I	0	’ The kind - hearted gentleman omitted to add that Newman Noggs , being utterly destitute , served him for rather less than the usual wages of a boy of thirteen ; and likewise failed to mention in his hasty chronicle , that his eccentric taciturnity rendered him an especially valuable person in a place where much business was done , of which it was desirable no mention should be made out of doors . The other gentleman was plainly impatient to be gone , however , and as they hurried into the hackney cabriolet immediately afterwards , perhaps Mr. Nickleby forgot to mention circumstances so unimportant . There was a great bustle in Bishopsgate Street Within , as they drew up , and ( it being a windy day ) half - a - dozen men were tacking across the road under a press of paper , bearing gigantic announcements that a Public Meeting would be holden at one o’clock precisely , to take into consideration the propriety of petitioning Parliament in favour of the United Metropolitan Improved Hot Muffin and Crumpet Baking and Punctual Delivery Company , capital five millions , in five hundred thousand shares of ten pounds each ; which sums were duly set forth in fat black figures of considerable size . Mr. Bonney elbowed his way briskly upstairs , receiving in his progress many low bows from the waiters who stood on the landings to show the way ; and , followed by Mr. Nickleby , dived into a suite of apartments behind the great public room : in the second of which was a business - looking table , and several business - looking people . ‘
7699	7714	7386	7386	I	0	’ cried a gentleman with a double chin , as Mr. Bonney presented himself . ‘
7721	7776	7386	7386	I	0	’ The new - comers were received with universal approbation , and Mr. Bonney bustled up to the top of the table , took off his hat , ran his fingers through his hair , and knocked a hackney - coachman ’s knock on the table with a little hammer : whereat several gentlemen cried ‘
7779	7825	7386	7386	I	0	’ and nodded slightly to each other , as much as to say what spirited conduct that was . Just at this moment , a waiter , feverish with agitation , tore into the room , and throwing the door open with a crash , shouted ‘
7830	8776	8777	8779	The honourable gentleman	739	’ The committee stood up and clapped their hands for joy , and while they were clapping them , in came Sir Matthew Pupker , attended by two live members of Parliament , one Irish and one Scotch , all smiling and bowing , and looking so pleasant that it seemed a perfect marvel how any man could have the heart to vote against them . Sir Matthew Pupker especially , who had a little round head with a flaxen wig on the top of it , fell into such a paroxysm of bows , that the wig threatened to be jerked off , every instant . When these symptoms had in some degree subsided , the gentlemen who were on speaking terms with Sir Matthew Pupker , or the two other members , crowded round them in three little groups , near one or other of which the gentlemen who were NOT on speaking terms with Sir Matthew Pupker or the two other members , stood lingering , and smiling , and rubbing their hands , in the desperate hope of something turning up which might bring them into notice . All this time , Sir Matthew Pupker and the two other members were relating to their separate circles what the intentions of government were , about taking up the bill ; with a full account of what the government had said in a whisper the last time they dined with it , and how the government had been observed to wink when it said so ; from which premises they were at no loss to draw the conclusion , that if the government had one object more at heart than another , that one object was the welfare and advantage of the United Metropolitan Improved Hot Muffin and Crumpet Baking and Punctual Delivery Company . Meanwhile , and pending the arrangement of the proceedings , and a fair division of the speechifying , the public in the large room were eyeing , by turns , the empty platform , and the ladies in the Music Gallery . In these amusements the greater portion of them had been occupied for a couple of hours before , and as the most agreeable diversions pall upon the taste on a too protracted enjoyment of them , the sterner spirits now began to hammer the floor with their boot - heels , and to express their dissatisfaction by various hoots and cries . These vocal exertions , emanating from the people who had been there longest , naturally proceeded from those who were nearest to the platform and furthest from the policemen in attendance , who having no great mind to fight their way through the crowd , but entertaining nevertheless a praiseworthy desire to do something to quell the disturbance , immediately began to drag forth , by the coat tails and collars , all the quiet people near the door ; at the same time dealing out various smart and tingling blows with their truncheons , after the manner of that ingenious actor , Mr. Punch : whose brilliant example , both in the fashion of his weapons and their use , this branch of the executive occasionally follows . Several very exciting skirmishes were in progress , when a loud shout attracted the attention even of the belligerents , and then there poured on to the platform , from a door at the side , a long line of gentlemen with their hats off , all looking behind them , and uttering vociferous cheers ; the cause whereof was sufficiently explained when Sir Matthew Pupker and the two other real members of Parliament came to the front , amidst deafening shouts , and testified to each other in dumb motions that they had never seen such a glorious sight as that , in the whole course of their public career . At length , and at last , the assembly left off shouting , but Sir Matthew Pupker being voted into the chair , they underwent a relapse which lasted five minutes . This over , Sir Matthew Pupker went on to say what must be his feelings on that great occasion , and what must be that occasion in the eyes of the world , and what must be the intelligence of his fellow - countrymen before him , and what must be the wealth and respectability of his honourable friends behind him , and lastly , what must be the importance to the wealth , the happiness , the comfort , the liberty , the very existence of a free and great people , of such an Institution as the United Metropolitan Improved Hot Muffin and Crumpet Baking and Punctual Delivery Company ! Mr. Bonney then presented himself to move the first resolution ; and having run his right hand through his hair , and planted his left , in an easy manner , in his ribs , he consigned his hat to the care of the gentleman with the double chin ( who acted as a species of bottle - holder to the orators generally ) , and said he would read to them the first resolution--‘That this meeting views with alarm and apprehension , the existing state of the Muffin Trade in this Metropolis and its neighbourhood ; that it considers the Muffin Boys , as at present constituted , wholly underserving the confidence of the public ; and that it deems the whole Muffin system alike prejudicial to the health and morals of the people , and subversive of the best interests of a great commercial and mercantile community . ’

9222	9225	9215	9220	Only one man in the crowd	762	‘ No ! ’
9250	9287	9310	9310	he	763	‘ all muffin ( or crumpet ) sellers , all traders in muffins ( or crumpets ) of whatsoever description , whether male or female , boys or men , ringing hand - bells or otherwise , ’
9992	10199	9991	9991	ladies	791	’ pocket - handkerchiefs , as threw the grievous gentleman quite into the shade . And when the petition had been read and was about to be adopted , there came forward the Irish member ( who was a young gentleman of ardent temperament , ) with such a speech as only an Irish member can make , breathing the true soul and spirit of poetry , and poured forth with such fervour , that it made one warm to look at him ; in the course whereof , he told them how he would demand the extension of that great boon to his native country ; how he would claim for her equal rights in the muffin laws as in all other laws ; and how he yet hoped to see the day when crumpets should be toasted in her lowly cabins , and muffin bells should ring in her rich green valleys . And , after him , came the Scotch member , with various pleasant allusions to the probable amount of profits , which increased the good humour that the poetry had awakened ; and all the speeches put together did exactly what they were intended to do , and established in the hearers ’

I can understand a man ’s dying of a broken neck , or suffering from a broken arm , or a broken head , or a broken leg , or a broken nose ; but a broken heart!--nonsense , it ’s the ca nt of the day .

13758	13762	13764	13765	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ I hoped , ’
13767	13798	13764	13765	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ that you might have an opportunity of doing something for your brother ’s children . It was his dying wish that I should appeal to you in their behalf . ’

13819	13857	13810	13810	Ralph	208	‘ but whenever a man dies without any property of his own , he always seems to think he has a right to dispose of other people ’s . What is your daughter fit for , ma’am ? ’

If my brother had been a man of activity and prudence , he might have left you a rich woman , ma’am : and if he had turned his son into the world , as my father turned me , when I was n’t as old as that boy by a year and a half , he would have been in a situation to help you , instead of being a burden upon you , and increasing your distress . My brother was a thoughtless , inconsiderate man , Mrs. Nickleby , and nobody , I am sure , can have better reason to feel that , than you . ’

15251	15276	15246	15246	I	0	’ said poor Nicholas , delighted with a thousand visionary ideas , that his good spirits and his inexperience were conjuring up before him . ‘

15339	15343	15329	15329	uncle	8733	’ sneered Ralph . ‘

15401	15405	15390	15390	uncle	8733	’ snarled Ralph . ‘
15412	15418	15390	15390	uncle	8733	’ cried Nicholas with enthusiasm . ‘
15468	16393	15450	15450	mother	933	’ The picture was too bright a one to bear , and Nicholas , fairly overpowered by it , smiled faintly , and burst into tears . This simple family , born and bred in retirement , and wholly unacquainted with what is called the world -- a conventional phrase which , being interpreted , often signifieth all the rascals in it -- mingled their tears together at the thought of their first separation ; and , this first gush of feeling over , were proceeding to dilate with all the buoyancy of untried hope on the bright prospects before them , when Mr. Ralph Nickleby suggested , that if they lost time , some more fortunate candidate might deprive Nicholas of the stepping - stone to fortune which the advertisement pointed out , and so undermine all their air - built castles . This timely reminder effectually stopped the conversation . Nicholas , having carefully copied the address of Mr. Squeers , the uncle and nephew issued forth together in quest of that accomplished gentleman ; Nicholas firmly persuading himself that he had done his relative great injustice in disliking him at first sight ; and Mrs. Nickleby being at some pains to inform her daughter that she was sure he was a much more kindly disposed person than he seemed ; which , Miss Nickleby dutifully remarked , he might very easily be . To tell the truth , the good lady ’s opinion had been not a little influenced by her brother - in - law ’s appeal to her better understanding , and his implied compliment to her high deserts ; and although she had dearly loved her husband , and still doted on her children , he had struck so successfully on one of those little jarring chords in the human heart ( Ralph was well acquainted with its worst weaknesses , though he knew nothing of its best ) , that she had already begun seriously to consider herself the amiable and suffering victim of her late husband ’s imprudence . CHAPTER 4 Nicholas and his Uncle ( to secure the Fortune without loss of time ) wait upon Mr. Wackford Squeers , the Yorkshire Schoolmaster Snow Hill ! What kind of place can the quiet townspeople who see the words emblazoned , in all the legibility of gilt letters and dark shading , on the north - country coaches , take Snow Hill to be ? All people have some undefined and shadowy notion of a place whose name is frequently before their eyes , or often in their ears . What a vast number of random ideas there must be perpetually floating about , regarding this same Snow Hill . The name is such a good one . Snow Hill -- Snow Hill too , coupled with a Saracen ’s Head : picturing to us by a double association of ideas , something stern and rugged ! A bleak desolate tract of country , open to piercing blasts and fierce wintry storms -- a dark , cold , gloomy heath , lonely by day , and scarcely to be thought of by honest folks at night -- a place which solitary wayfarers shun , and where desperate robbers congregate;--this , or something like this , should be the prevalent notion of Snow Hill , in those remote and rustic parts , through which the Saracen ’s Head , like some grim apparition , rushes each day and night with mysterious and ghost - like punctuality ; holding its swift and headlong course in all weathers , and seeming to bid defiance to the very elements themselves . The reality is rather different , but by no means to be despised notwithstanding . There , at the very core of London , in the heart of its business and animation , in the midst of a whirl of noise and motion : stemming as it were the giant currents of life that flow ceaselessly on from different quarters , and meet beneath its walls : stands Newgate ; and in that crowded street on which it frowns so darkly -- within a few feet of the squalid tottering houses -- upon the very spot on which the vendors of soup and fish and damaged fruit are now plying their trades -- scores of human beings , amidst a roar of sounds to which even the tumult of a great city is as nothing , four , six , or eight strong men at a time , have been hurried violently and swiftly from the world , when the scene has been rendered frightful with excess of human life ; when curious eyes have glared from casement and house - top , and wall and pillar ; and when , in the mass of white and upturned faces , the dying wretch , in his all - comprehensive look of agony , has met not one -- not one -- that bore the impress of pity or compassion . Near to the jail , and by consequence near to Smithfield also , and the Compter , and the bustle and noise of the city ; and just on that particular part of Snow Hill where omnibus horses going eastward seriously think of falling down on purpose , and where horses in hackney cabriolets going westward not unfrequently fall by accident , is the coach - yard of the Saracen ’s Head Inn ; its portal guarded by two Saracens ’
16540	16619	16526	16528	a small Saracen	958	’ Heads below , so that the general appearance of the pile is decidedly of the Saracenic order . When you walk up this yard , you will see the booking - office on your left , and the tower of St Sepulchre ’s church , darting abruptly up into the sky , on your right , and a gallery of bedrooms on both sides . Just before you , you will observe a long window with the words ‘
16623	17003	16526	16528	a small Saracen	958	’ legibly painted above it ; and looking out of that window , you would have seen in addition , if you had gone at the right time , Mr. Wackford Squeers with his hands in his pockets . Mr. Squeers ’s appearance was not prepossessing . He had but one eye , and the popular prejudice runs in favour of two . The eye he had , was unquestionably useful , but decidedly not ornamental : being of a greenish grey , and in shape resembling the fan - light of a street door . The blank side of his face was much wrinkled and puckered up , which gave him a very sinister appearance , especially when he smiled , at which times his expression bordered closely on the villainous . His hair was very flat and shiny , save at the ends , where it was brushed stiffly up from a low protruding forehead , which assorted well with his harsh voice and coarse manner . He was about two or three and fifty , and a trifle below the middle size ; he wore a white neckerchief with long ends , and a suit of scholastic black ; but his coat sleeves being a great deal too long , and his trousers a great deal too short , he appeared ill at ease in his clothes , and as if he were in a perpetual state of astonishment at finding himself so respectable . Mr. Squeers was standing in a box by one of the coffee - room fire - places , fitted with one such table as is usually seen in coffee - rooms , and two of extraordinary shapes and dimensions made to suit the angles of the partition . In a corner of the seat , was a very small deal trunk , tied round with a scanty piece of cord ; and on the trunk was perched -- his lace - up half - boots and corduroy trousers dangling in the air -- a diminutive boy , with his shoulders drawn up to his ears , and his hands planted on his knees , who glanced timidly at the schoolmaster , from time to time , with evident dread and apprehension . ‘
17009	17029	16526	16528	a small Saracen	958	’ muttered Mr. Squeers , turning from the window , and looking sulkily at the coffee - room clock . ‘
17037	17090	17033	17034	nobody here	959	’ Much vexed by this reflection , Mr. Squeers looked at the little boy to see whether he was doing anything he could beat him for . As he happened not to be doing anything at all , he merely boxed his ears , and told him not to do it again . ‘
17094	17103	17033	17034	nobody here	959	’ muttered Mr. Squeers , resuming his complaint , ‘
17168	17184	17156	17156	parents	8378	’ Here the little boy on the top of the trunk gave a violent sneeze . ‘
17189	17197	17156	17156	parents	8378	’ growled the schoolmaster , turning round . ‘
17204	17205	17202	17202	sir	714	’ ‘
17211	17217	17202	17202	sir	714	’ replied the little boy . ‘
17222	17227	17229	17229	sir	714	’ exclaimed Mr. Squeers . ‘
17234	17248	17231	17231	I	0	’ rejoined the boy , trembling till the little trunk shook under him . ‘
17256	17261	17254	17254	you	0	’ retorted Mr. Squeers . ‘
17274	17333	17265	17265	you	0	’ In default of a better answer to this question , the little boy screwed a couple of knuckles into each of his eyes and began to cry , wherefore Mr Squeers knocked him off the trunk with a blow on one side of the face , and knocked him on again with a blow on the other . ‘
17347	17352	17336	17336	I	0	’ said Mr Squeers , ‘
17370	17371	17363	17363	you	0	’ ‘
17378	17398	17372	17372	Ye	0	’ sobbed the little boy , rubbing his face very hard with the Beggar ’s Petition in printed calico . ‘
17407	17411	17405	17405	sir	714	’ said Squeers . ‘
17416	17466	17413	17413	you	0	’ As this admonition was accompanied with a threatening gesture , and uttered with a savage aspect , the little boy rubbed his face harder , as if to keep the tears back ; and , beyond alternately sniffing and choking , gave no further vent to his emotions . ‘
17470	17481	17467	17468	Mr. Squeers	203	’ said the waiter , looking in at this juncture ; ‘
17493	17494	17496	17497	the gentleman	8574	’ ‘
17502	17512	17496	17497	the gentleman	8574	’ replied Mr. Squeers , in a soft voice . ‘
17534	17578	17579	17579	My	0	’ The schoolmaster had scarcely uttered these words in a fierce whisper , when the stranger entered . Affecting not to see him , Mr. Squeers feigned to be intent upon mending a pen , and offering benevolent advice to his youthful pupil . ‘
17583	17588	17579	17579	My	0	’ said Mr. Squeers , ‘
17691	17692	17695	17696	the gentleman	8574	’ ‘
17698	17713	17695	17696	the gentleman	8574	’ observed the stranger , stopping the schoolmaster in the rehearsal of his advertisement . ‘
17722	17723	17720	17720	sir	714	’ ‘
17729	17741	17742	17743	The gentleman	8574	’ said Mr. Squeers , with an assumption of extreme surprise . ‘
17745	17750	17742	17743	The gentleman	8574	’ said the stranger , ‘
17758	17759	17742	17743	The gentleman	8574	’ ‘
17789	17794	17795	17795	You	714	’ added Mr. Squeers . ‘
17826	17861	17821	17821	you	714	’ With this salutation Mr. Squeers patted the heads of two hollow - eyed , small - boned little boys , whom the applicant had brought with him , and waited for further communications . ‘
17878	17893	17874	17874	Snawley	232	’ said the stranger . Squeers inclined his head as much as to say , ‘
17902	17907	17908	17908	I	0	’ The stranger continued . ‘
17925	17926	17913	17914	Mr. Squeers	203	’ ‘

17982	17992	17975	17976	Mr Squeers	203	’ rejoined the schoolmaster , with a persuasive smile . ‘
18003	18010	17997	17997	I	0	’ said Mr. Snawley , solemnly . ‘
18022	18036	18020	18020	sir	714	’ replied Squeers , as if he had never considered the proposition before . ‘
18082	18083	18065	18065	You	714	’ ‘
18090	18095	18065	18065	You	714	’ said Mr. Snawley . ‘

18132	18144	18146	18146	Squeers	231	‘ Every wholesome luxury , sir , that Yorkshire can afford , ’
18148	18182	18146	18146	Squeers	231	‘ every beautiful moral that Mrs. Squeers can instil ; every -- in short , every comfort of a home that a boy could wish for , will be theirs , Mr. Snawley . ’
18183	18195	18197	18198	Mr Snawley	232	‘ I should wish their morals to be particularly attended to , ’
18200	18209	18211	18212	the schoolmaster	8373	‘ I am glad of that , sir , ’
18218	18231	18215	18215	himself	8373	‘ They have come to the right shop for morals , sir . ’
18232	18240	18242	18243	Mr. Snawley	232	‘ You are a moral man yourself , ’
18245	18254	18256	18256	Squeers	231	‘ I rather believe I am , sir , ’
18258	18270	18272	18273	Mr. Snawley	232	‘ I have the satisfaction to know you are , sir , ’
18275	18290	18272	18273	Mr. Snawley	232	‘ I asked one of your references , and he said you were pious . ’
18291	18306	18308	18308	Squeers	231	‘ Well , sir , I hope I am a little in that line , ’
18310	18317	18319	18320	the other	8439	‘ I hope I am also , ’
18322	18336	18319	18320	the other	8439	‘ Could I say a few words with you in the next box ? ’
18337	18342	18344	18344	Squeers	231	‘ By all means , ’
18349	18384	18344	18344	Squeers	231	‘ My dears , will you speak to your new playfellow a minute or two ? That is one of my boys , sir . Belling his name is,--a Taunton boy that , sir . ’
18385	18391	18393	18394	Mr. Snawley	232	‘ Is he , indeed ? ’
18411	18421	18423	18423	Squeers	231	‘ He goes down with me tomorrow , sir , ’
18425	18480	18423	18423	Squeers	231	‘ That ’s his luggage that he is a sitting upon now . Each boy is required to bring , sir , two suits of clothes , six shirts , six pair of stockings , two nightcaps , two pocket - handkerchiefs , two pair of shoes , two hats , and a razor . ’
18481	18485	18487	18488	Mr. Snawley	232	‘ A razor ! ’
18498	18502	18487	18488	Mr. Snawley	232	‘ What for ? ’

18637	18663	18665	18665	Squeers	231	‘ Just as long as their friends make the quarterly payments to my agent in town , or until such time as they run away , ’
18667	18688	18665	18665	Squeers	231	‘ Let us understand each other ; I see we may safely do so . What are these boys;--natural children ? ’

19249	19264	19246	19246	I	0	’ replied the father - in - law , reciprocating the schoolmaster ’s grin . ‘

19297	19306	19246	19246	I	0	’ said Squeers , taking up a pen ; ‘
19319	19367	19316	19316	I	0	’ Having entered Mr. Snawley ’s address , the schoolmaster had next to perform the still more agreeable office of entering the receipt of the first quarter ’s payment in advance , which he had scarcely completed , when another voice was heard inquiring for Mr. Squeers . ‘
19372	19377	19316	19316	I	0	’ replied the schoolmaster ; ‘
19382	19383	19316	19316	I	0	’ ‘
19392	19405	19390	19390	sir	714	’ said Ralph Nickleby , presenting himself , closely followed by Nicholas . ‘

19432	19452	19429	19429	you	714	’ said Squeers , who had by this time got back to the box by the fire - place . ‘

19468	19489	19465	19465	I	0	’ replied Ralph , suiting the action to the word , and placing his hat on the table before him . ‘
19501	19502	19497	19499	Mr Nicholas Nickleby	235	’ ‘
19510	19544	19505	19505	you	714	’ said Squeers . Nicholas bowed , said he was very well , and seemed very much astonished at the outward appearance of the proprietor of Dotheboys Hall : as indeed he was . ‘
19550	19560	19546	19546	you	714	’ said Ralph , looking narrowly at the schoolmaster . ‘
19587	19591	19592	19592	I	0	’ replied Squeers . ‘
19595	19599	19592	19592	I	0	’ rejoined Ralph . ‘

19619	19627	19628	19628	I	0	’ said Ralph , finishing the sentence . ‘
19635	19639	19633	19633	sir	714	’ rejoined Squeers . ‘
19742	19762	19763	19763	These	1048	’ Ralph smiled , as if he meant anything but smiling , and looked round at the strangers present . ‘
19771	19827	19763	19763	These	1048	’ said Wackford Squeers , pointing to the little boy on the trunk and the two little boys on the floor , who had been staring at each other without uttering a word , and writhing their bodies into most remarkable contortions , according to the custom of little boys when they first become acquainted . ‘
19888	19889	19898	19898	sir	714	’ ‘
19900	19906	19898	19898	sir	714	’ interrupted Ralph , testily . ‘

19928	19932	19915	19915	You	714	’ replied Squeers . ‘

19995	20005	19986	19986	I	0	’ interrupted Ralph , checking the torrent of recommendation ; ‘

20028	20032	20026	20026	sir	714	’ rejoined Squeers . ‘

20071	20076	20077	20077	He	203	’ repeated Master Belling . ‘
20086	20090	20092	20093	the gentleman	8574	’ said Ralph . ‘
20095	20099	20092	20093	the gentleman	8574	’ said Squeers . ‘
20104	20109	20092	20093	the gentleman	8574	’ repeated Master Belling . ‘
20113	20117	20092	20093	the gentleman	8574	’ said Squeers ; ‘
20121	20122	20092	20093	the gentleman	8574	’ ‘
20125	20131	20092	20093	the gentleman	8574	’ repeated Master Belling again . ‘
20136	20140	20092	20093	the gentleman	8574	’ said Squeers . ‘
20143	20144	20092	20093	the gentleman	8574	’ ‘
20147	20155	20092	20093	the gentleman	8574	’ suggested Nicholas , good - naturedly . ‘
20160	20165	20092	20093	the gentleman	8574	’ said Master Belling . ‘

20179	20191	20177	20177	sir	714	’ said Squeers , darting a withering look at the culprit . ‘

20216	20220	20194	20194	I	0	’ said Ralph , ‘

20277	20281	20262	20262	You	714	’ said Squeers . ‘

20292	20296	20283	20283	you	714	’ answered Squeers . ‘
20301	20305	20298	20298	he	1070	’ said Ralph . ‘

20345	20362	20341	20341	I	0	’ said Squeers , perplexed with such an application from a youth of Nicholas ’s figure , ‘
20374	20375	20378	20378	he	900	’ ‘
20381	20385	20378	20378	he	900	’ said Ralph ; ‘

20437	20445	20432	20432	I	0	’ said Nicholas , addressing Mr. Squeers , ‘

20475	20522	20447	20447	you	714	’ replied Squeers , looking as grave as he could , and considerably puzzled , no less by the contrast between the simplicity of the nephew and the worldly manner of the uncle , than by the incomprehensible allusion to the young noblemen under his tuition . ‘
20528	20532	20526	20526	sir	714	’ said Ralph ; ‘
20546	20547	20533	20533	I	0	’ ‘
20555	20559	20549	20549	you	714	’ rejoined Squeers . ‘
20598	20602	20588	20588	him	1085	’ said Ralph . ‘
20607	20612	20604	20604	I	0	’ observed the schoolmaster . ‘
20617	20633	20615	20615	I	0	’ said Mr. Snawley , thinking it as well to back his new friend occasionally . ‘
20658	20662	20639	20639	he	1085	’ said Ralph . ‘
20695	20696	20691	20691	you	714	’ ‘
20702	20721	20722	20722	I	0	’ replied Squeers , half imitating the sneer with which the old gentleman was regarding his unconscious relative . ‘
20728	20734	20722	20722	I	0	’ said Nicholas , eagerly . ‘
20744	20756	20735	20735	He	1085	’ said Ralph , in the same dry , hard manner . ‘
20861	20862	20991	20995	an odd - looking man	1093	’ ‘
20868	20886	20991	20995	an odd - looking man	1093	’ said Squeers , answering a nod of Ralph ’s head with a nod of his own . ‘
20889	20893	20991	20995	an odd - looking man	1093	’ rejoined Ralph . ‘
20902	20947	20895	20895	me	0	’ The two words were had apart ; in a couple of minutes Mr. Wackford Squeers announced that Mr. Nicholas Nickleby was , from that moment , thoroughly nominated to , and installed in , the office of first assistant master at Dotheboys Hall . ‘
20959	20988	20956	20957	Mr. Nickleby	208	’ said Wackford Squeers . Nicholas , overjoyed at his success , shook his uncle ’s hand warmly , and could almost have worshipped Squeers upon the spot . ‘
20997	21001	20989	20989	He	8729	’ thought Nicholas . ‘
21025	21026	21017	21018	Doctor Johnson	239	’ ‘
21036	21040	21033	21034	Mr. Nickleby	208	’ said Squeers , ‘
21062	21063	21045	21045	You	208	’ ‘
21068	21072	21066	21066	sir	714	’ said Nicholas . ‘
21082	21086	21078	21078	I	0	’ growled Ralph . ‘
21100	21155	21156	21156	I	0	’ Here was another instance of his uncle ’s generosity ! Nicholas felt his unexpected kindness so much , that he could scarcely find words to thank him ; indeed , he had not found half enough , when they took leave of the schoolmaster , and emerged from the Saracen ’s Head gateway . ‘
21169	21173	21156	21156	I	0	’ said Ralph . ‘
21177	21178	21182	21182	sir	714	’ ‘
21184	21188	21182	21182	sir	714	’ replied Nicholas ; ‘
21196	21197	21189	21189	I	0	’ ‘
21204	21209	21210	21210	You	208	’ replied his uncle . ‘
21240	21241	21228	21228	you	208	’ ‘
21244	21248	21228	21228	you	208	’ said Nicholas . ‘
21254	21255	21249	21249	I	0	’ ‘
21265	21274	21277	21277	him	1101	’ said Ralph , producing a small parcel , ‘
21285	21362	21277	21277	him	1101	’ Nicholas cheerfully undertook the errand , and bidding his worthy uncle an affectionate farewell , which that warm - hearted old gentleman acknowledged by a growl , hastened away to execute his commission . He found Golden Square in due course ; Mr. Noggs , who had stepped out for a minute or so to the public - house , was opening the door with a latch - key , as he reached the steps . ‘
21367	21376	21277	21277	him	1101	’ inquired Noggs , pointing to the parcel . ‘
21382	21386	21388	21388	you	1104	’ replied Nicholas ; ‘
21389	21405	21434	21434	he	211	’re to have the goodness to wait till he comes home , if you please . ’
21406	21409	21411	21411	Noggs	211	‘ Uncle ! ’
21413	21417	21419	21419	Nicholas	235	‘ Mr. Nickleby , ’
21423	21427	21429	21429	Newman	211	‘ Come in , ’
21493	21499	21501	21501	Nicholas	235	‘ There is no answer , ’
21543	21547	21549	21549	Nicholas	235	‘ No answer , ’
21823	21835	21837	21837	Nicholas	235	‘ But , what ’s the matter -- are you ill ? ’
22443	22450	22455	22457	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ Is that you , Hannah ? ’
22472	22481	22483	22483	Nicholas	235	‘ It is I , Miss La Creevy , ’
22493	22497	22499	22501	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ Bless us ! ’
22514	22516	22506	22506	her	222	‘ You ’re
22524	22525	22521	22522	Mr. Nickleby	235	’ ‘
22530	22534	22528	22528	you	222	’ replied Nicholas . ‘
22550	22555	22547	22548	Mr. Nickleby	235	’ returned the lady . ‘
22557	22568	22569	22571	Miss La Creevy	222	’m waiting for the light to carry out an idea . ’
22612	22619	22621	22623	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ To carry out an idea , ’
22625	22669	22621	22623	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ and that ’s the great convenience of living in a thoroughfare like the Strand . When I want a nose or an eye for any particular sitter , I have only to look out of window and wait till I get one . ’
22670	22682	22684	22684	Nicholas	235	‘ Does it take long to get a nose , now ? ’
22688	22701	22703	22705	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ Why , that depends in a great measure on the pattern , ’
22707	22757	22703	22705	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ Snubs and Romans are plentiful enough , and there are flats of all sorts and sizes when there ’s a meeting at Exeter Hall ; but perfect aquilines , I am sorry to say , are scarce , and we generally use them for uniforms or public characters . ’
22758	22761	22763	22763	Nicholas	235	‘ Indeed ! ’
22765	22785	22763	22763	Nicholas	235	‘ If I should meet with any in my travels , I ’ll endeavour to sketch them for you . ’
22786	22813	22815	22817	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ You do n’t mean to say that you are really going all the way down into Yorkshire this cold winter ’s weather , Mr. Nickleby ? ’
22819	22828	22815	22817	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ I heard something of it last night . ’
22829	22835	22837	22837	Nicholas	235	‘ I do , indeed , ’
22839	22866	22837	22837	Nicholas	235	‘ Needs must , you know , when somebody drives . Necessity is my driver , and that is only another name for the same gentleman . ’
22867	22884	22886	22888	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ Well , I am very sorry for it ; that ’s all I can say , ’
22890	22950	22886	22888	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ as much on your mother ’s and sister ’s account as on yours . Your sister is a very pretty young lady , Mr. Nickleby , and that is an additional reason why she should have somebody to protect her . I persuaded her to give me a sitting or two , for the street - door case . ‘
22960	22996	22953	22953	she	1136	’ As Miss La Creevy spoke , she held up an ivory countenance intersected with very perceptible sky - blue veins , and regarded it with so much complacency , that Nicholas quite envied her . ‘
23010	23018	23021	23021	you	1137	’ said Nicholas , presenting his hand , ‘
23024	23025	23021	23021	you	1137	’ ‘
23030	23039	23021	23021	you	1137	’ said the good - natured miniature painter ; ‘
23054	23457	23049	23049	I	0	’ It was very little that Nicholas knew of the world , but he guessed enough about its ways to think , that if he gave Miss La Creevy one little kiss , perhaps she might not be the less kindly disposed towards those he was leaving behind . So , he gave her three or four with a kind of jocose gallantry , and Miss La Creevy evinced no greater symptoms of displeasure than declaring , as she adjusted her yellow turban , that she had never heard of such a thing , and could n’t have believed it possible . Having terminated the unexpected interview in this satisfactory manner , Nicholas hastily withdrew himself from the house . By the time he had found a man to carry his box it was only seven o’clock , so he walked slowly on , a little in advance of the porter , and very probably with not half as light a heart in his breast as the man had , although he had no waistcoat to cover it with , and had evidently , from the appearance of his other garments , been spending the night in a stable , and taking his breakfast at a pump . Regarding , with no small curiosity and interest , all the busy preparations for the coming day which every street and almost every house displayed ; and thinking , now and then , that it seemed rather hard that so many people of all ranks and stations could earn a livelihood in London , and that he should be compelled to journey so far in search of one ; Nicholas speedily arrived at the Saracen ’s Head , Snow Hill . Having dismissed his attendant , and seen the box safely deposited in the coach - office , he looked into the coffee - room in search of Mr. Squeers . He found that learned gentleman sitting at breakfast , with the three little boys before noticed , and two others who had turned up by some lucky chance since the interview of the previous day , ranged in a row on the opposite seat . Mr. Squeers had before him a small measure of coffee , a plate of hot toast , and a cold round of beef ; but he was at that moment intent on preparing breakfast for the little boys . ‘
23469	23503	23467	23467	waiter	1138	’ said Mr. Squeers , looking down into a large blue mug , and slanting it gently , so as to get an accurate view of the quantity of liquid contained in it . ‘
23510	23515	23508	23508	sir	714	’ replied the waiter . ‘
23530	23539	23508	23508	sir	714	’ said Mr. Squeers , with a sigh . ‘
23554	23555	23552	23552	you	242	’ ‘
23563	23568	23561	23561	sir	714	’ inquired the waiter . ‘
23577	23578	23561	23561	sir	714	’ ‘
23584	23589	23561	23561	sir	714	’ replied Mr. Squeers . ‘
23611	23612	23609	23609	you	242	’ ‘
23618	23619	23616	23616	sir	714	’ ‘
23626	23630	23616	23616	sir	714	’ said Squeers ; ‘
23651	23675	23679	23680	Mr. Nickleby	235	’ As he uttered this moral precept , Mr. Squeers took a large bite out of the cold beef , and recognised Nicholas . ‘
23682	23686	23679	23680	Mr. Nickleby	235	’ said Squeers . ‘
23696	23726	23693	23693	you	242	’ Nicholas did NOT see that anybody was breakfasting , except Mr. Squeers ; but he bowed with all becoming reverence , and looked as cheerful as he could . ‘
23741	23745	23739	23739	William	242	’ said Squeers . ‘
23758	23796	23842	23843	Mr. Nickleby	235	’ At this fresh mention of the bread and butter , the five little boys looked very eager , and followed the waiter out , with their eyes ; meanwhile Mr. Squeers tasted the milk and water . ‘
23799	23808	23842	23843	Mr. Nickleby	235	’ said that gentleman , smacking his lips , ‘
23845	23846	23842	23843	Mr. Nickleby	235	’ ‘
23852	23856	23842	23843	Mr. Nickleby	235	’ said Nicholas . ‘
23863	23875	23858	23858	I	0	’ pursued Mr. Squeers , putting the mug before the children , ‘
23924	23925	23928	23928	sir	714	’ ‘
23930	23940	23928	23928	sir	714	’ cried all the little boys with great eagerness . ‘
23945	23956	23928	23928	sir	714	’ said Squeers , calmly getting on with his breakfast ; ‘
23993	24071	23990	23991	Mr. Nickleby	235	’ said the schoolmaster , turning to Nicholas , and speaking with his mouth very full of beef and toast . Nicholas murmured something -- he knew not what -- in reply ; and the little boys , dividing their gaze between the mug , the bread and butter ( which had by this time arrived ) , and every morsel which Mr. Squeers took into his mouth , remained with strained eyes in torments of expectation . ‘
24079	24088	24073	24073	God	225	’ said Squeers , when he had finished . ‘
24096	24153	24089	24090	Number one	1155	’ Number one seized the mug ravenously , and had just drunk enough to make him wish for more , when Mr. Squeers gave the signal for number two , who gave up at the same interesting moment to number three ; and the process was repeated until the milk and water terminated with number five . ‘
24157	24178	24089	24090	Number one	1155	’ said the schoolmaster , dividing the bread and butter for three into as many portions as there were children , ‘
24206	24264	24265	24265	I	0	’ Permission being thus given to fall to , the boys began to eat voraciously , and in desperate haste : while the schoolmaster ( who was in high good humour after his meal ) picked his teeth with a fork , and looked smilingly on . In a very short time , the horn was heard . ‘
24273	24289	24265	24265	I	0	’ said Squeers , jumping up and producing a little basket from under the seat ; ‘
24313	24410	24305	24305	You	1156	’ Nicholas was considerably startled by these very economical arrangements ; but he had no time to reflect upon them , for the little boys had to be got up to the top of the coach , and their boxes had to be brought out and put in , and Mr. Squeers ’s luggage was to be seen carefully deposited in the boot , and all these offices were in his department . He was in the full heat and bustle of concluding these operations , when his uncle , Mr. Ralph Nickleby , accosted him . ‘
24419	24423	24305	24305	You	1156	’ said Ralph . ‘

24437	24445	24467	24467	they	1164	’ cried Nicholas , looking hastily round . ‘
24448	24453	24467	24467	they	1164	’ replied his uncle . ‘
24480	24481	24467	24467	they	1164	’ ‘
24499	24521	24482	24482	We	1167	’ said Mrs. Nickleby , embracing her son , heedless of the unconcerned lookers - on in the coach - yard . ‘
24527	24531	24532	24532	you	8678	’ returned Ralph , ‘
24533	24599	24616	24617	Mrs Nickleby	207	’re the best judge of course . I merely said that you were paying a hackney coach . I never pay a hackney coach , ma’am ; I never hire one . I have n’t been in a hackney coach of my own hiring , for thirty years , and I hope I sha n’t be for thirty more , if I live as long . ’
24600	24614	24616	24617	Mrs Nickleby	207	‘ I should never have forgiven myself if I had not seen him , ’
24619	24638	24616	24617	Mrs Nickleby	207	‘ Poor dear boy -- going away without his breakfast too , because he feared to distress us ! ’
24639	24644	24646	24646	Ralph	208	‘ Mighty fine certainly , ’
24652	24697	24646	24646	Ralph	208	‘ When I first went to business , ma’am , I took a penny loaf and a ha’porth of milk for my breakfast as I walked to the city every morning ; what do you say to that , ma’am ? Breakfast ! Bah ! ’
24698	24703	24705	24705	Squeers	203	‘ Now , Nickleby , ’
24716	24727	24705	24705	Squeers	203	‘ I think you ’d better get up behind . I ’m
24746	24747	24748	24749	Dear Nicholas	207	’ ‘
24751	24761	24748	24749	Dear Nicholas	207	’ whispered Kate , touching her brother ’s arm , ‘
24768	24769	24764	24766	that vulgar man	1172	’ ‘
24772	24784	24764	24766	that vulgar man	1172	’ growled Ralph , whose quick ears had caught the inquiry . ‘
24798	24799	24792	24793	Mr. Squeers	203	’ ‘
24811	24818	24819	24819	I	0	’ replied Kate , shrinking back . ‘
24820	24832	24834	24834	Ralph	208	’m sure I heard you say as much , my dear , ’
24841	24854	24836	24836	his	208	‘ Mr. Squeers , here ’s my niece : Nicholas ’s sister ! ’
24855	24865	24867	24867	Squeers	203	‘ Very glad to make your acquaintance , miss , ’
24877	24916	24867	24867	Squeers	203	‘ I wish Mrs. Squeers took gals , and we had you for a teacher . I do n’t know , though , whether she might n’t grow jealous if we had . Ha ! ha ! ha ! ’
24999	25004	25006	25008	the young lady	893	‘ My dear Nicholas , ’
25010	25029	25006	25008	the young lady	893	‘ who is this man ? What kind of place can it be that you are going to ? ’
25030	25037	25039	25039	Nicholas	207	‘ I hardly know , Kate , ’
25047	25063	25039	25039	Nicholas	207	‘ I suppose the Yorkshire folks are rather rough and uncultivated ; that ’s all . ’
25064	25069	25071	25071	Kate	210	‘ But this person , ’
25073	25089	25091	25091	Nicholas	207	‘ Is my employer , or master , or whatever the proper name may be , ’
25094	25164	25091	25091	Nicholas	207	‘ and I was an ass to take his coarseness ill . They are looking this way , and it is time I was in my place . Bless you , love , and goodbye ! Mother , look forward to our meeting again someday ! Uncle , farewell ! Thank you heartily for all you have done and all you mean to do . Quite ready , sir ! ’
25281	25286	25288	25288	Nicholas	207	‘ What ’s this ? ’
25290	25293	25295	25295	Noggs	211	‘ Hush ! ’
25318	25332	25299	25301	Mr. Ralph Nickleby	208	‘ Take it . Read it . Nobody knows . That ’s all . ’
25333	25336	25338	25338	Nicholas	207	‘ Stop ! ’
25340	25343	25345	25345	Noggs	211	‘ No , ’
25444	25465	25441	25443	The little boys	8939	’ legs being too short to admit of their feet resting upon anything as they sat , and the little boys ’
25562	25574	25576	25579	the new - comer	1198	‘ If we put some of these youngsters in the middle , ’
25581	25596	25576	25579	the new - comer	1198	‘ they ’ll be safer in case of their going to sleep ; eh ? ’
25597	25607	25609	25609	Squeers	231	‘ If you ’ll have the goodness , sir , ’
25611	25649	25651	25651	Squeers	231	‘ that ’ll be the very thing . Mr. Nickleby , take three of them boys between you and the gentleman . Belling and the youngest Snawley can sit between me and the guard . Three children , ’

25664	25675	25677	25681	the fresh - coloured gentleman	1200	‘ I have not the least objection I am sure , ’
25683	25718	25677	25681	the fresh - coloured gentleman	1200	‘ I have a brother who would n’t object to book his six children as two at any butcher ’s or baker ’s in the kingdom , I dare say . Far from it . ’
25719	25725	25727	25727	Squeers	231	‘ Six children , sir ? ’
25729	25736	25738	25739	the stranger	8829	‘ Yes , and all boys , ’
25741	25745	25747	25747	Squeers	231	‘ Mr. Nickleby , ’
25753	25835	25747	25747	Squeers	231	‘ catch hold of that basket . Let me give you a card , sir , of an establishment where those six boys can be brought up in an enlightened , liberal , and moral manner , with no mistake at all about it , for twenty guineas a year each -- twenty guineas , sir -- or I ’d take all the boys together upon a average right through , and say a hundred pound a year for the lot . ’
25836	25839	25841	25842	the gentleman	8574	‘ Oh ! ’
25849	25861	25841	25842	the gentleman	8574	‘ you are the Mr. Squeers mentioned here , I presume ? ’
25862	25870	25872	25874	the worthy pedagogue	1203	‘ Yes , I am , sir , ’
25876	25886	25841	25842	the gentleman	8574	‘ Mr. Wackford Squeers is my name , and I ’m

25977	26000	25974	25974	my	0	’ said the gentleman , glancing at Nicholas with a half - smile , and a more than half expression of surprise , ‘

26015	26029	26008	26008	You	714	’ rejoined Squeers , thrusting his hands into his great - coat pockets . ‘
26090	26091	26119	26119	Snawley	232	’ ‘
26095	26100	26119	26119	Snawley	232	’ said the passenger . ‘
26114	26118	26112	26112	sir	714	’ rejoined Squeers . ‘
26155	26156	26139	26139	I	0	’ ‘
26163	26172	26161	26161	genelmen	1221	’ said the guard as he clambered up . ‘
26180	26185	26178	26178	Dick	243	’ cried the coachman . ‘
26189	26194	26178	26178	Dick	243	’ was the reply . ‘
26199	27093	26178	26178	Dick	243	’ And off she did go -- if coaches be feminine -- amidst a loud flourish from the guard ’s horn , and the calm approval of all the judges of coaches and coach - horses congregated at the Peacock , but more especially of the helpers , who stood , with the cloths over their arms , watching the coach till it disappeared , and then lounged admiringly stablewards , bestowing various gruff encomiums on the beauty of the turn - out . When the guard ( who was a stout old Yorkshireman ) had blown himself quite out of breath , he put the horn into a little tunnel of a basket fastened to the coach - side for the purpose , and giving himself a plentiful shower of blows on the chest and shoulders , observed it was uncommon cold ; after which , he demanded of every person separately whether he was going right through , and if not , where he WAS going . Satisfactory replies being made to these queries , he surmised that the roads were pretty heavy arter that fall last night , and took the liberty of asking whether any of them gentlemen carried a snuff - box . It happening that nobody did , he remarked with a mysterious air that he had heard a medical gentleman as went down to Grantham last week , say how that snuff - taking was bad for the eyes ; but for his part he had never found it so , and what he said was , that everybody should speak as they found . Nobody attempting to controvert this position , he took a small brown - paper parcel out of his hat , and putting on a pair of horn spectacles ( the writing being crabbed ) read the direction half - a - dozen times over ; having done which , he consigned the parcel to its old place , put up his spectacles again , and stared at everybody in turn . After this , he took another blow at the horn by way of refreshment ; and , having now exhausted his usual topics of conversation , folded his arms as well as he could in so many coats , and falling into a solemn silence , looked carelessly at the familiar objects which met his eye on every side as the coach rolled on ; the only things he seemed to care for , being horses and droves of cattle , which he scrutinised with a critical air as they were passed upon the road . The weather was intensely and bitterly cold ; a great deal of snow fell from time to time ; and the wind was intolerably keen . Mr. Squeers got down at almost every stage -- to stretch his legs as he said -- and as he always came back from such excursions with a very red nose , and composed himself to sleep directly , there is reason to suppose that he derived great benefit from the process . The little pupils having been stimulated with the remains of their breakfast , and further invigorated by sundry small cups of a curious cordial carried by Mr. Squeers , which tasted very like toast - and - water put into a brandy bottle by mistake , went to sleep , woke , shivered , and cried , as their feelings prompted . Nicholas and the good - tempered man found so many things to talk about , that between conversing together , and cheering up the boys , the time passed with them as rapidly as it could , under such adverse circumstances . So the day wore on . At Eton Slocomb there was a good coach dinner , of which the box , the four front outsides , the one inside , Nicholas , the good - tempered man , and Mr. Squeers , partook ; while the five little boys were put to thaw by the fire , and regaled with sandwiches . A stage or two further on , the lamps were lighted , and a great to - do occasioned by the taking up , at a roadside inn , of a very fastidious lady with an infinite variety of cloaks and small parcels , who loudly lamented , for the behoof of the outsides , the non - arrival of her own carriage which was to have taken her on , and made the guard solemnly promise to stop every green chariot he saw coming ; which , as it was a dark night and he was sitting with his face the other way , that officer undertook , with many fervent asseverations , to do . Lastly , the fastidious lady , finding there was a solitary gentleman inside , had a small lamp lighted which she carried in reticule , and being after much trouble shut in , the horses were put into a brisk canter and the coach was once more in rapid motion . The night and the snow came on together , and dismal enough they were . There was no sound to be heard but the howling of the wind ; for the noise of the wheels , and the tread of the horses ’
27389	27393	27395	27396	the guard	9007	‘ Wo ho ! ’
27410	27413	27395	27396	the guard	9007	’ heads . ‘

27437	27443	27445	27445	Nicholas	207	‘ What ’s the matter ? ’

27519	27528	27529	27529	I	0	’ cried Nicholas , staggering to his feet , ‘
27530	27534	27553	27554	the guard	9007	’m ready . I ’m

27592	27627	27553	27554	the guard	9007	’ In truth , the animals were no sooner released than they trotted back , with much deliberation , to the stable they had just left , which was distant not a mile behind . ‘
27631	27635	27637	27638	the guard	9007	’ a harn ? ’
27648	27655	27657	27657	Nicholas	207	‘ I dare say I can , ’
27659	27663	27657	27657	Nicholas	207	‘ Then just blo ’

27713	28069	27711	27711	wooman	1249	’ As the man spoke , he proceeded to wrench open the uppermost door of the coach , while Nicholas , seizing the horn , awoke the echoes far and wide with one of the most extraordinary performances on that instrument ever heard by mortal ears . It had its effect , however , not only in rousing such of their fall , but in summoning assistance to their relief ; for lights gleamed in the distance , and people were already astir . In fact , a man on horseback galloped down , before the passengers were well collected together ; and a careful investigation being instituted , it appeared that the lady inside had broken her lamp , and the gentleman his head ; that the two front outsides had escaped with black eyes ; the box with a bloody nose ; the coachman with a contusion on the temple ; Mr. Squeers with a portmanteau bruise on his back ; and the remaining passengers without any injury at all -- thanks to the softness of the snow - drift in which they had been overturned . These facts were no sooner thoroughly ascertained , than the lady gave several indications of fainting , but being forewarned that if she did , she must be carried on some gentleman ’s shoulders to the nearest public - house , she prudently thought better of it , and walked back with the rest . They found on reaching it , that it was a lonely place with no very great accommodation in the way of apartments -- that portion of its resources being all comprised in one public room with a sanded floor , and a chair or two . However , a large faggot and a plentiful supply of coals being heaped upon the fire , the appearance of things was not long in mending ; and , by the time they had washed off all effaceable marks of the late accident , the room was warm and light , which was a most agreeable exchange for the cold and darkness out of doors . ‘
28075	28086	28072	28073	Mr. Nickleby	208	’ said Squeers , insinuating himself into the warmest corner , ‘
28130	28131	28121	28121	You	208	’ ‘
28135	28159	28121	28121	You	208	’ said the merry - faced gentleman , who did not seem to approve very much of the patronising tone adopted by Squeers , ‘
28185	28209	28210	28210	I	0	’ This remark called up a discourse relative to the promptitude Nicholas had displayed , and he was overwhelmed with compliments and commendations . ‘
28221	28225	28231	28231	he	781	’ observed Squeers : ‘
28295	28296	28302	28302	sir	714	’ ‘
28304	28312	28302	28302	sir	714	’ inquired the lady who had carried the ‘
28314	28320	28302	28302	sir	714	’ or safety - lamp . ‘
28329	28341	28327	28327	ma’am	8678	’ replied Squeers , diving into his greatcoat pocket for cards . ‘
28366	28403	28353	28354	Mrs. Squeers	231	‘ em . Mr. Nickleby , hand the lady them cards , and offer these to the gentleman . Perhaps they might know of some parents that would be glad to avail themselves of the establishment . ’
28457	28470	28472	28476	the merry - faced gentleman	9081	‘ I hope you suffer no inconvenience from the overturn , ma’am ? ’
28494	28499	28501	28502	the lady	8485	‘ No bodily inconvenience , ’
28504	28512	28501	28502	the lady	8485	‘ No mental inconvenience , I hope ? ’
28513	28527	28529	28530	the lady	8485	‘ The subject is a very painful one to my feelings , sir , ’
28535	28550	28529	28530	the lady	8485	‘ and I beg you as a gentleman , not to refer to it . ’
28551	28555	28557	28561	the merry - faced gentleman	9081	‘ Dear me , ’
28567	28573	28557	28561	the merry - faced gentleman	9081	‘ I merely intended to inquire-- ’
28574	28583	28585	28586	the lady	8485	‘ I hope no inquiries will be made , ’
28588	28635	28585	28586	the lady	8485	‘ or I shall be compelled to throw myself on the protection of the other gentlemen . Landlord , pray direct a boy to keep watch outside the door -- and if a green chariot passes in the direction of Grantham , to stop it instantly . ’
28764	28779	28781	28794	the good - tempered gentleman when they had been all sitting round the fire	1280	‘ As the guard has gone on horseback to Grantham to get another coach , ’
28803	28833	28781	28794	the good - tempered gentleman when they had been all sitting round the fire	1280	‘ and as he must be gone a couple of hours at the very least , I propose a bowl of hot punch . What say you , sir ? ’
28982	28988	28990	28990	gentleman	1289	‘ I can not indeed , ’
28997	29003	29005	29012	the owner of the good - humoured countenance	1290	‘ That ’s a pity , ’
29014	29029	29005	29012	the owner of the good - humoured countenance	1290	‘ Is there nobody here who can sing a song to lighten the time ? ’
29066	29074	29076	29077	the president	1292	‘ Perhaps the lady would not object , ’
29090	29113	29087	29087	his	1292	‘ Some little Italian thing out of the last opera brought out in town , would be most acceptable I am sure . ’
29165	29172	29174	29174	he	1292	‘ I would if I could , ’
29182	29229	29174	29174	he	1292	‘ for I hold that in this , as in all other cases where people who are strangers to each other are thrown unexpectedly together , they should endeavour to render themselves as pleasant , for the joint sake of the little community , as possible . ’
29230	29245	29247	29251	the grey - headed gentleman	1288	‘ I wish the maxim were more generally acted on , in all cases , ’
29253	29255	29247	29251	the grey - headed gentleman	1288	‘ I ’m
29261	29266	29247	29251	the grey - headed gentleman	1288	’ returned the other . ‘
29282	29283	29275	29275	you	1292	’ ‘
29291	29292	29289	29289	you	1292	’ ‘

29306	29316	29289	29289	you	1292	’ said the grey - haired gentleman , smiling , ‘
29413	29465	29404	29408	the grey - headed gentleman	1288	‘ A great many years ago -- for the fifteenth century was scarce two years old at the time , and King Henry the Fourth sat upon the throne of England -- there dwelt , in the ancient city of York , five maiden sisters , the subjects of my tale . ‘
29549	29644	29510	29510	They	1302	‘ But , if the four elder sisters were lovely , how beautiful was the youngest , a fair creature of sixteen ! The blushing tints in the soft bloom on the fruit , or the delicate painting on the flower , are not more exquisite than was the blending of the rose and lily in her gentle face , or the deep blue of her eye . The vine , in all its elegant luxuriance , is not more graceful than were the clusters of rich brown hair that sported round her brow . ‘
29746	29854	29855	29855	You	1314	‘ The heart of this fair girl bounded with joy and gladness . Devoted attachment to her sisters , and a fervent love of all beautiful things in nature , were its pure affections . Her gleesome voice and merry laugh were the sweetest music of their home . She was its very light and life . The brightest flowers in the garden were reared by her ; the caged birds sang when they heard her voice , and pined when they missed its sweetness . Alice , dear Alice ; what living thing within the sphere of her gentle witchery , could fail to love her ! ‘
29982	30123	30166	30167	the sisters	1327	‘ It was a bright and sunny morning in the pleasant time of summer , when one of those black monks emerged from the abbey portal , and bent his steps towards the house of the fair sisters . Heaven above was blue , and earth beneath was green ; the river glistened like a path of diamonds in the sun ; the birds poured forth their songs from the shady trees ; the lark soared high above the waving corn ; and the deep buzz of insects filled the air . Everything looked gay and smiling ; but the holy man walked gloomily on , with his eyes bent upon the ground . The beauty of the earth is but a breath , and man is but a shadow . What sympathy should a holy preacher have with either ? ‘
30168	30248	30258	30259	the friar	1329	’ orchard , through which he passed , closing it behind him . The noise of soft voices in conversation , and of merry laughter , fell upon his ears ere he had advanced many paces ; and raising his eyes higher than was his humble wo nt , he descried , at no great distance , the five sisters seated on the grass , with Alice in the centre : all busily plying their customary task of embroidering . ‘
30284	30334	30344	30345	the monk	1333	‘ The sisters saluted the holy man with becoming reverence , and the eldest motioned him to a mossy seat beside them . But the good friar shook his head , and bumped himself down on a very hard stone,--at which , no doubt , approving angels were gratified . ‘
30347	30376	30344	30345	the monk	1333	‘ “ You know how light of heart sweet Alice is , ” replied the eldest sister , passing her fingers through the tresses of the smiling girl . ‘
30414	30438	30403	30403	Alice	249	‘ The monk answered not , save by a grave inclination of the head , and the sisters pursued their task in silence . ‘
30507	30569	30743	30744	the friar	1329	‘ “ Father , ” urged the maiden , pausing , as did each of the others , in her busy task , “ we have prayed at matins , our daily alms have been distributed at the gate , the sick peasants have been tended,--all our morning tasks have been performed . I hope our occupation is a blameless one ? ’
30570	30687	30688	30691	The four elder sisters	9108	‘ “ See here , ” said the friar , taking the frame from her hand , “ an intricate winding of gaudy colours , without purpose or object , unless it be that one day it is destined for some vain ornament , to minister to the pride of your frail and giddy sex . Day after day has been employed upon this senseless task , and yet it is not half accomplished . The shade of each departed day falls upon our graves , and the worm exults as he beholds it , to know that we are hastening thither . Daughters , is there no better way to pass the fleeting hours ? ” ‘
30719	30737	30707	30707	Alice	249	‘ “ Our dear mother , ” said the maiden ; “ Heaven rest her soul ! ” ‘
30750	30908	30743	30744	the friar	1329	‘ “ Our dear mother , ” faltered the fair Alice , “ was living when these long tasks began , and bade us , when she should be no more , ply them in all discretion and cheerfulness , in our leisure hours ; she said that if in harmless mirth and maidenly pursuits we passed those hours together , they would prove the happiest and most peaceful of our lives , and that if , in later times , we went forth into the world , and mingled with its cares and trials -- if , allured by its temptations and dazzled by its glitter , we ever forgot that love and duty which should bind , in holy ties , the children of one loved parent -- a glance at the old work of our common girlhood would awaken good thoughts of bygone days , and soften our hearts to affection and love . ” ‘
30938	31005	31012	31012	he	1260	‘ It was a kind of sampler of large size , that each sister had before her ; the device was of a complex and intricate description , and the pattern and colours of all five were the same . The sisters bent gracefully over their work ; the monk , resting his chin upon his hands , looked from one to the other in silence . ‘
31115	31276	31287	31287	she	9139	‘ “ Never , sisters , ” cried Alice . “ Barter not the light and air of heaven , and the freshness of earth and all the beautiful things which breathe upon it , for the cold cloister and the cell . Nature ’s own blessings are the proper goods of life , and we may share them sinlessly together . To die is our heavy portion , but , oh , let us die with life about us ; when our cold hearts cease to beat , let warm hearts be beating near ; let our last look be upon the bounds which God has set to his own bright skies , and not on stone walls and bars of iron ! Dear sisters , let us live and die , if you list , in this green garden ’s compass ; only shun the gloom and sadness of a cloister , and we shall be happy . ” ‘
31304	31355	31287	31287	she	9139	‘ “ Take comfort , Alice , ” said the eldest , kissing her fair forehead . “ The veil shall never cast its shadow on thy young brow . How say you , sisters ? For yourselves you speak , and not for Alice , or for me . ” ‘
31387	31509	31540	31540	his	1357	‘ “ Father , ” said the eldest lady , rising with dignity , “ you hear our final resolve . The same pious care which enriched the abbey of St Mary , and left us , orphans , to its holy guardianship , directed that no constraint should be imposed upon our inclinations , but that we should be free to live according to our choice . Let us hear no more of this , we pray you . Sisters , it is nearly noon . Let us take shelter until evening ! ” With a reverence to the friar , the lady rose and walked towards the house , hand in hand with Alice ; the other sisters followed . ‘
31575	31801	31563	31563	he	1357	‘ “ Stay ! ” said the monk , raising his right hand in the air , and directing an angry glance by turns at Alice and the eldest sister . “ Stay , and hear from me what these recollections are , which you would cherish above eternity , and awaken -- if in mercy they slumbered -- by means of idle toys . The memory of earthly things is charged , in after life , with bitter disappointment , affliction , death ; with dreary change and wasting sorrow . The time will one day come , when a glance at those unmeaning baubles will tear open deep wounds in the hearts of some among you , and strike to your inmost souls . When that hour arrives -- and , mark me , come it will -- turn from the world to which you clung , to the refuge which you spurned . Find me the cell which shall be colder than the fire of mortals grows , when dimmed by calamity and trial , and there weep for the dreams of youth . These things are Heaven ’s will , not mine , ” said the friar , subduing his voice as he looked round upon the shrinking girls . “ The Virgin ’s blessing be upon you , daughters ! ” ‘
31825	31889	31563	31563	he	1357	‘ But nature will smile though priests may frown , and next day the sun shone brightly , and on the next , and the next again . And in the morning ’s glare , and the evening ’s soft repose , the five sisters still walked , or worked , or beguiled the time by cheerful conversation , in their quiet orchard . ‘
32126	32156	32124	32125	the sisters	1327	’ house ; and after this , a mournful silence fell upon it , and knight or lady , horse or armour , was seen about it no more . ‘
32288	32337	32342	32342	he	1383	‘ No longer were the friar ’s eyes directed to the earth ; they were cast abroad , and roamed from point to point , as if the gloom and desolation of the scene found a quick response in his own bosom . Again he paused near the sisters ’
32348	32412	32342	32342	he	1383	‘ But not again did his ear encounter the sound of laughter , or his eyes rest upon the beautiful figures of the five sisters . All was silent and deserted . The boughs of the trees were bent and broken , and the grass had grown long and rank . No light feet had pressed it for many , many a day . ‘
32480	32491	32492	32493	The monk	1333	‘ And Alice -- where was she ? In Heaven . ‘
32545	32608	32609	32609	She	1394	‘ “ They are here , sisters , ” said the elder lady in a trembling voice . “ I have never borne to look upon them since , and now I blame myself for my weakness . What is there in her memory that we should dread ? To call up our old days shall be a solemn pleasure yet . ” ‘
32685	32714	32677	32677	she	1394	‘ The monk rose and advanced towards them . “ It was almost the last thing she touched in health , ” he said in a low voice . ‘
32728	32737	32721	32723	the elder lady	9198	‘ The monk turned to the second sister . ‘
32811	32821	32829	32829	he	1398	‘ The lady groaned , and wrung her hands . ‘
32886	32898	32907	32908	the monk	1333	‘ The sobs of the two sisters were their only reply . ‘
32960	33077	33080	33080	they	1410	‘ The sisters asked for three days to deliberate ; and felt , that night , as though the veil were indeed the fitting shroud for their dead joys . But , morning came again , and though the boughs of the orchard trees drooped and ran wild upon the ground , it was the same orchard still . The grass was coarse and high , but there was yet the spot on which they had so often sat together , when change and sorrow were but names . There was every walk and nook which Alice had made glad ; and in the minster nave was one flat stone beneath which she slept in peace . ‘
33142	33252	33113	33113	they	1410	‘ They sent abroad , to artists of great celebrity in those times , and having obtained the church ’s sanction to their work of piety , caused to be executed , in five large compartments of richly stained glass , a faithful copy of their old embroidery work . These were fitted into a large window until that time bare of ornament ; and when the sun shone brightly , as she had so well loved to see it , the familiar patterns were reflected in their original colours , and throwing a stream of brilliant light upon the pavement , fell warmly on the name of Alice . ‘
33330	33400	33410	33414	the merry - faced gentleman	9081	‘ That stone has worn away and been replaced by others , and many generations have come and gone since then . Time has softened down the colours , but the same stream of light still falls upon the forgotten tomb , of which no trace remains ; and , to this day , the stranger is shown in York Cathedral , an old window called the Five Sisters . ’
33401	33408	33410	33414	the merry - faced gentleman	9081	‘ That ’s a melancholy tale , ’
33420	33437	33439	33440	the other	8439	‘ It is a tale of life , and life is made up of such sorrows , ’
33454	33476	33478	33483	the gentleman with the merry face	1420	‘ There are shades in all good pictures , but there are lights too , if we choose to contemplate them , ’
33485	33498	33478	33483	the gentleman with the merry face	1420	‘ The youngest sister in your tale was always light - hearted . ’
33499	33504	33506	33507	the other	8439	‘ And died early , ’
33511	33526	33528	33530	the first speaker	764	‘ She would have died earlier , perhaps , had she been less happy , ’
33536	33632	33528	33530	the first speaker	764	‘ Do you think the sisters who loved her so well , would have grieved the less if her life had been one of gloom and sadness ? If anything could soothe the first sharp pain of a heavy loss , it would be -- with me -- the reflection , that those I mourned , by being innocently happy here , and loving all about them , had prepared themselves for a purer and happier world . The sun does not shine upon this fair earth to meet frowning eyes , depend upon it . ’
33633	33640	33642	33648	the gentleman who had told the story	1423	‘ I believe you are right , ’
33650	33653	33655	33656	the other	8439	‘ Believe ! ’
33658	33689	33655	33656	the other	8439	‘ can anybody doubt it ? Take any subject of sorrowful regret , and see with how much pleasure it is associated . The recollection of past pleasure may become pain-- ’
33690	33694	33696	33697	the other	8439	‘ It does , ’
33699	33803	33696	33697	the other	8439	‘ Well ; it does . To remember happiness which can not be restored , is pain , but of a softened kind . Our recollections are unfortunately mingled with much that we deplore , and with many actions which we bitterly repent ; still in the most chequered life I firmly think there are so many little rays of sunshine to look back upon , that I do not believe any mortal ( unless he had put himself without the pale of hope ) would deliberately drain a goblet of the waters of Lethe , if he had it in his power . ’
33804	33813	33815	33819	the grey - haired gentleman	1287	‘ Possibly you are correct in that belief , ’
33825	33834	33815	33819	the grey - haired gentleman	1287	‘ I am inclined to think you are . ’
33835	33840	33842	33843	the other	8439	‘ Why , then , ’
33845	33913	33842	33843	the other	8439	‘ the good in this state of existence preponderates over the bad , let miscalled philosophers tell us what they will . If our affections be tried , our affections are our consolation and comfort ; and memory , however sad , is the best and purest link between this world and a better . But come ! I ’ll tell you a story of another kind . ’
33956	34224	33952	33955	THE BARON OF GROGZWIG	253	‘ The Baron Von Koeldwethout , of Grogzwig in Germany , was as likely a young baron as you would wish to see . I need n’t say that he lived in a castle , because that ’s of course ; neither need I say that he lived in an old castle ; for what German baron ever lived in a new one ? There were many strange circumstances connected with this venerable building , among which , not the least startling and mysterious were , that when the wind blew , it rumbled in the chimneys , or even howled among the trees in the neighbouring forest ; and that when the moon shone , she found her way through certain small loopholes in the wall , and actually made some parts of the wide halls and galleries quite light , while she left others in gloomy shadow . I believe that one of the baron ’s ancestors , being short of money , had inserted a dagger in a gentleman who called one night to ask his way , and it WAS supposed that these miraculous occurrences took place in consequence . And yet I hardly know how that could have been , either , because the baron ’s ancestor , who was an amiable man , felt very sorry afterwards for having been so rash , and laying violent hands upon a quantity of stone and timber which belonged to a weaker baron , built a chapel as an apology , and so took a receipt from Heaven , in full of all demands . ‘
34411	34553	34403	34403	I	0	‘ Well , but the Baron Von Koeldwethout of Grogzwig ! He was a fine swarthy fellow , with dark hair and large moustachios , who rode a - hunting in clothes of Lincoln green , with russet boots on his feet , and a bugle slung over his shoulder like the guard of a long stage . When he blew this bugle , four - and - twenty other gentlemen of inferior rank , in Lincoln green a little coarser , and russet boots with a little thicker soles , turned out directly : and away galloped the whole train , with spears in their hands like lacquered area railings , to hunt down the boars , or perhaps encounter a bear : in which latter case the baron killed him first , and greased his whiskers with him afterwards . ‘
34623	34743	34617	34621	the jovial crew of Grogzwig	1447	‘ But the pleasures of the table , or the pleasures of under the table , require a little variety ; especially when the same five - and - twenty people sit daily down to the same board , to discuss the same subjects , and tell the same stories . The baron grew weary , and wanted excitement . He took to quarrelling with his gentlemen , and tried kicking two or three of them every day after dinner . This was a pleasant change at first ; but it became monotonous after a week or so , and the baron felt quite out of sorts , and cast about , in despair , for some new amusement . ‘
34852	34888	34889	34896	The four - and - twenty Lincoln greens	1452	‘ “ I will ! ” cried the baron suddenly , smiting the table with his right hand , and twirling his moustache with his left . “ Fill to the Lady of Grogzwig ! ” ‘
34916	34936	34946	34948	the Lincoln greens	256	‘ “ I said to the Lady of Grogzwig , ” repeated the baron , looking round the board . ‘
34988	35039	34974	34974	they	1452	‘ “ The fair daughter of the Baron Von Swillenhausen , ” said Koeldwethout , condescending to explain . “ We will demand her in marriage of her father , ere the sun goes down tomorrow . If he refuse our suit , we will cut off his nose . ” ‘
35071	35255	35048	35049	every man	781	‘ What a pleasant thing filial piety is to contemplate ! If the daughter of the Baron Von Swillenhausen had pleaded a preoccupied heart , or fallen at her father ’s feet and corned them in salt tears , or only fainted away , and complimented the old gentleman in frantic ejaculations , the odds are a hundred to one but Swillenhausen Castle would have been turned out at window , or rather the baron turned out at window , and the castle demolished . The damsel held her peace , however , when an early messenger bore the request of Von Koeldwethout next morning , and modestly retired to her chamber , from the casement of which she watched the coming of the suitor and his retinue . She was no sooner assured that the horseman with the large moustachios was her proffered husband , than she hastened to her father ’s presence , and expressed her readiness to sacrifice herself to secure his peace . The venerable baron caught his child to his arms , and shed a wink of joy . ‘
35347	35386	35341	35341	his	1457	‘ For six mortal weeks , the bears and boars had a holiday . The houses of Koeldwethout and Swillenhausen were united ; the spears rusted ; and the baron ’s bugle grew hoarse for lack of blowing . ‘
35420	35430	35437	35438	the baron	9235	‘ “ My dear , ” said the baroness . ‘
35440	35448	35437	35438	the baron	9235	‘ “ Those coarse , noisy men-- ” ‘
35461	35502	35456	35457	the baron	9235	‘ The baroness pointed , from the window at which they stood , to the courtyard beneath , where the unconscious Lincoln greens were taking a copious stirrup - cup , preparatory to issuing forth after a boar or two . ‘
35515	35527	35512	35513	the baron	9235	‘ “ Disband them , love , ” murmured the baroness . ‘
35540	35553	35534	35535	the baron	9235	‘ “ To please me , love , ” replied the baroness . ‘
35567	35585	35564	35565	the baron	9235	‘ Whereupon the baroness uttered a great cry , and swooned away at the baron ’s feet . ‘
35661	35730	35744	35744	their	1458	‘ It is not for me to say by what means , or by what degrees , some wives manage to keep down some husbands as they do , although I may have my private opinion on the subject , and may think that no Member of Parliament ought to be married , inasmuch as three married members out of every four , must vote according to their wives ’
35899	36202	36203	36205	The poor baron	1484	‘ Nor was this the whole extent of the baron ’s misfortunes . About a year after his nuptials , there came into the world a lusty young baron , in whose honour a great many fireworks were let off , and a great many dozens of wine drunk ; but next year there came a young baroness , and next year another young baron , and so on , every year , either a baron or baroness ( and one year both together ) , until the baron found himself the father of a small family of twelve . Upon every one of these anniversaries , the venerable Baroness Von Swillenhausen was nervously sensitive for the well - being of her child the Baroness Von Koeldwethout ; and although it was not found that the good lady ever did anything material towards contributing to her child ’s recovery , still she made it a point of duty to be as nervous as possible at the castle of Grogzwig , and to divide her time between moral observations on the baron ’s housekeeping , and bewailing the hard lot of her unhappy daughter . And if the Baron of Grogzwig , a little hurt and irritated at this , took heart , and ventured to suggest that his wife was at least no worse off than the wives of other barons , the Baroness Von Swillenhausen begged all persons to take notice , that nobody but she , sympathised with her dear daughter ’s sufferings ; upon which , her relations and friends remarked , that to be sure she did cry a great deal more than her son - in - law , and that if there were a hard - hearted brute alive , it was that Baron of Grogzwig . ‘
36317	36343	36309	36309	he	253	‘ “ I do n’t see what is to be done , ” said the baron . “ I think I ’ll kill myself . ” ‘
36384	36405	36406	36407	The baron	9235	‘ “ Hem ! ” said the baron , stopping short . “ Perhaps it ’s not sharp enough . ” ‘
36457	36507	36508	36511	One of the domestics	1495	‘ “ If I had been a bachelor , ” said the baron sighing , “ I might have done it fifty times over , without being interrupted . Hallo ! Put a flask of wine and the largest pipe in the little vaulted room behind the hall . ” ‘
36592	36603	36613	36614	the domestic	1501	‘ “ Leave the lamp , ” said the baron . ‘
36616	36637	36613	36614	the domestic	1501	‘ “ The room , ” replied the baron . The domestic obeyed , and the baron locked the door . ‘
36705	36809	36687	36687	himself	260	‘ He thought about a great many things -- about his present troubles and past days of bachelorship , and about the Lincoln greens , long since dispersed up and down the country , no one knew whither : with the exception of two who had been unfortunately beheaded , and four who had killed themselves with drinking . His mind was running upon bears and boars , when , in the process of draining his glass to the bottom , he raised his eyes , and saw , for the first time and with unbounded astonishment , that he was not alone . ‘
36947	36963	36969	36970	the stranger	8829	‘ “ Halloa ! ” said the baron , stamping his foot to attract attention . ‘
36990	37024	37032	37033	the figure	1508	‘ “ What now ! ” replied the baron , nothing daunted by his hollow voice and lustreless eyes . “ I should ask that question . How did you get here ? ” ‘
37035	37046	37032	37033	the figure	1508	‘ “ What are you ? ” says the baron . ‘
37056	37069	37053	37054	the figure	1508	‘ “ I do n’t believe it , ” says the baron . ‘
37080	37090	37077	37078	the figure	1508	‘ “ I will , ” rejoined the baron . ‘
37109	37122	37147	37148	the figure	1508	‘ “ There ’s no coming over you , I see . I ’m

37150	37166	37147	37148	the figure	1508	‘ “ You do n’t look much like one , ” returned the baron scornfully . ‘
37189	37265	37271	37272	the figure	1508	‘ With these words the apparition turned towards the baron , as if composing himself for a talk -- and , what was very remarkable , was , that he threw his cloak aside , and displaying a stake , which was run through the centre of his body , pulled it out with a jerk , and laid it on the table , as composedly as if it had been a walking - stick . ‘
37289	37308	37271	37272	the figure	1508	‘ “ Not quite , ” rejoined the baron ; “ I must finish this pipe first . ” ‘
37319	37332	37316	37317	the figure	1508	‘ “ You seem in a hurry , ” said the baron . ‘
37348	37377	37343	37344	the figure	1508	’re doing a pretty brisk business in my way , over in England and France just now , and my time is a good deal taken up . ” ‘
37398	37418	37385	37386	the baron	9235	‘ “ Nine times out of ten , and then very hard , ” rejoined the figure , drily . ‘
37429	37448	37426	37427	the baron	9235	‘ “ Never , ” replied the figure , with a shudder , “ that breeds cheerfulness . ” ‘
37489	37507	37460	37460	he	9235	‘ “ No , ” replied the figure evasively ; “ but I am always present . ” ‘
37522	37576	37519	37520	the baron	9235	‘ “ Just that , ” replied the figure , playing with his stake , and examining the ferule . “ Be as quick as you can , will you , for there ’s a young gentleman who is afflicted with too much money and leisure wanting me now , I find . ” ‘
37626	37649	37656	37657	the baron	9235	‘ “ I say , ” expostulated the figure , looking very much scared ; “ do n’t do that again . ” ‘
37659	37688	37689	37690	The baron	9235	‘ “ Because it gives me pain all over , ” replied the figure . “ Sigh as much as you please : that does me good . ” ‘
37718	37753	37700	37705	the figure , brightening up again	1534	‘ “ It ’s not a bad idea though , ” said the baron , feeling the edge of the weapon ; “ a man killing himself because he has too much money . ” ‘
37781	37858	37759	37760	the apparition	1518	‘ Whether the genius unintentionally committed himself in saying this , or whether he thought the baron ’s mind was so thoroughly made up that it did n’t matter what he said , I have no means of knowing . I only know that the baron stopped his hand , all of a sudden , opened his eyes wide , and looked as if quite a new light had come upon him for the first time . ‘
37879	37890	37866	37867	Von Koeldwethout	253	‘ “ Except empty coffers , ” cried the genius . ‘
37908	37918	37905	37906	the baron	9235	‘ “ Scolding wives , ” snarled the genius . ‘
37933	37943	37930	37931	the baron	9235	‘ “ Thirteen children , ” shouted the genius . ‘
37958	38007	37955	37956	the baron	9235	‘ The genius was evidently growing very savage with the baron , for holding these opinions all at once ; but he tried to laugh it off , and said if he would let him know when he had left off joking he should feel obliged to him . ‘
38027	38074	38024	38025	the baron	9235	‘ “ Well , I am glad to hear that , ” said the genius , looking very grim , “ because a joke , without any figure of speech , IS the death of me . Come ! Quit this dreary world at once . ” ‘
38162	38175	38148	38148	he	9235	‘ “ Dispatch , ” cried the figure , gnashing his teeth . ‘
38185	38235	38182	38183	the baron	9235	‘ I ’ll brood over miseries no longer , but put a good face on the matter , and try the fresh air and the bears again ; and if that do n’t do , I ’ll talk to the baroness soundly , and cut the Von Swillenhausens dead . ’
38259	38306	38238	38239	the baron	9235	‘ The figure fell back a pace or two , regarding the baron meanwhile with a look of intense terror , and when he had ceased , caught up the stake , plunged it violently into its body , uttered a frightful howl , and disappeared . ‘
38463	38464	38458	38461	the Baron of Grogzwig	9306	’ ‘
38479	38779	38476	38476	you	1559	’ said a new driver , looking in . This intelligence caused the punch to be finished in a great hurry , and prevented any discussion relative to the last story . Mr. Squeers was observed to draw the grey - headed gentleman on one side , and to ask a question with great apparent interest ; it bore reference to the Five Sisters of York , and was , in fact , an inquiry whether he could inform him how much per annum the Yorkshire convents got in those days with their boarders . The journey was then resumed . Nicholas fell asleep towards morning , and , when he awoke , found , with great regret , that , during his nap , both the Baron of Grogzwig and the grey - haired gentleman had got down and were gone . The day dragged on uncomfortably enough . At about six o’clock that night , he and Mr. Squeers , and the little boys , and their united luggage , were all put down together at the George and New Inn , Greta Bridge . CHAPTER 7 Mr. and Mrs. Squeers at Home Mr. Squeers , being safely landed , left Nicholas and the boys standing with the luggage in the road , to amuse themselves by looking at the coach as it changed horses , while he ran into the tavern and went through the leg - stretching process at the bar . After some minutes , he returned , with his legs thoroughly stretched , if the hue of his nose and a short hiccup afforded any criterion ; and at the same time there came out of the yard a rusty pony - chaise , and a cart , driven by two labouring men . ‘
38790	38798	38476	38476	you	1559	’ said Squeers , rubbing his hands ; ‘
38817	38850	38815	38815	Nickleby	208	’ Nicholas obeyed . Mr. Squeers with some difficulty inducing the pony to obey also , they started off , leaving the cart - load of infant misery to follow at leisure . ‘
38857	38870	38873	38873	sir	714	’ inquired Squeers , after they had travelled some distance in silence . ‘
38879	38880	38873	38873	sir	714	’ ‘
38891	38895	38815	38815	Nickleby	208	’ said Squeers ; ‘
38904	38905	38815	38815	Nickleby	208	’ ‘
38916	38920	38914	38914	sir	714	’ asked Nicholas . ‘
38927	38931	38914	38914	sir	714	’ replied Squeers . ‘
38943	38956	38933	38933	you	208	’ Nicholas coughed , as if he would like to know why . ‘
38967	38972	38933	38933	you	208	’ observed Squeers drily . ‘
38977	38989	38933	38933	you	208	’ said Nicholas , whom this piece of intelligence much astonished . ‘
38992	38996	38933	38933	you	208	’ replied Squeers . ‘
39048	39049	39050	39050	I	0	’ ‘
39056	39105	39050	39050	I	0	’ rejoined Nicholas . Squeers eyed his companion slyly , at the conclusion of this little dialogue , and finding that he had grown thoughtful and appeared in nowise disposed to volunteer any observations , contented himself with lashing the pony until they reached their journey ’s end . ‘
39109	39113	39050	39050	I	0	’ said Squeers . ‘
39130	39217	39128	39128	you	0	’ While the schoolmaster was uttering these and other impatient cries , Nicholas had time to observe that the school was a long , cold - looking house , one storey high , with a few straggling out - buildings behind , and a barn and stable adjoining . After the lapse of a minute or two , the noise of somebody unlocking the yard - gate was heard , and presently a tall lean boy , with a lantern in his hand , issued forth . ‘
39224	39228	39220	39220	you	0	’ cried Squeers . ‘
39233	39238	39220	39220	you	0	’ replied the boy . ‘
39249	39250	39253	39253	sir	714	’ ‘
39262	39269	39255	39255	I	0	’ answered Smike , with humility . ‘
39281	39288	39294	39294	sir	714	’ demanded the schoolmaster , sharply . ‘
39296	39301	39302	39302	Missus	1577	’ replied the boy . ‘
39319	39320	39302	39302	Missus	1577	’ ‘
39327	39331	39324	39325	a fool	1580	’ retorted Squeers . ‘
39349	39507	39345	39345	I	0	’ By this time Mr. Squeers had dismounted ; and after ordering the boy to see to the pony , and to take care that he had n’t any more corn that night , he told Nicholas to wait at the front - door a minute while he went round and let him in . A host of unpleasant misgivings , which had been crowding upon Nicholas during the whole journey , thronged into his mind with redoubled force when he was left alone . His great distance from home and the impossibility of reaching it , except on foot , should he feel ever so anxious to return , presented itself to him in most alarming colours ; and as he looked up at the dreary house and dark windows , and upon the wild country round , covered with snow , he felt a depression of heart and spirit which he had never experienced before . ‘
39511	39525	39345	39345	I	0	’ cried Squeers , poking his head out at the front - door . ‘
39532	39533	39528	39528	you	1581	’ ‘
39538	39542	39536	39536	sir	714	’ replied Nicholas . ‘
39548	39551	39536	39536	sir	714	’ said Squeers ‘
39570	39775	39536	39536	sir	714	’ Nicholas sighed , and hurried in . Mr. Squeers , having bolted the door to keep it shut , ushered him into a small parlour scantily furnished with a few chairs , a yellow map hung against the wall , and a couple of tables ; one of which bore some preparations for supper ; while , on the other , a tutor ’s assistant , a Murray ’s grammar , half - a - dozen cards of terms , and a worn letter directed to Wackford Squeers , Esquire , were arranged in picturesque confusion . They had not been in this apartment a couple of minutes , when a female bounced into the room , and , seizing Mr. Squeers by the throat , gave him two loud kisses : one close after the other , like a postman ’s knock . The lady , who was of a large raw - boned figure , was about half a head taller than Mr. Squeers , and was dressed in a dimity night - jacket ; with her hair in papers ; she had also a dirty nightcap on , relieved by a yellow cotton handkerchief which tied it under the chin . ‘
39781	39796	39779	39779	Squeery	266	’ said this lady in a playful manner , and a very hoarse voice . ‘
39803	39807	39779	39779	Squeery	266	’ replied Squeers . ‘
39813	39814	39779	39779	Squeery	266	’ ‘
39822	39827	39779	39779	Squeery	266	’ answered the lady . ‘
39832	39836	39840	39840	they	1585	’ said Squeers . ‘
39847	39848	39840	39840	they	1585	’ ‘
39856	39867	39868	39869	The boys	772	’ said Squeers , pulling off his great - coat . ‘
39879	39880	39876	39876	I	0	’ ‘
39886	39890	39892	39893	Mrs. Squeers	231	’re well enough , ’
39897	39906	39892	39893	Mrs. Squeers	231	‘ That young Pitcher ’s had a fever . ’
39907	39910	39912	39912	Squeers	231	‘ No ! ’
39914	39928	39912	39912	Squeers	231	‘ Damn that boy , he ’s always at something of that sort . ’
39929	39940	39942	39943	Mrs. Squeers	231	‘ Never was such a boy , I do believe , ’
39945	39989	39942	39943	Mrs. Squeers	231	‘ whatever he has is always catching too . I say it ’s obstinacy , and nothing shall ever convince me that it is n’t . I ’d beat it out of him ; and I told you that , six months ago . ’
39990	39998	40000	40000	Squeers	231	‘ So you did , my love , ’
40002	40011	40000	40000	Squeers	231	‘ We ’ll try what can be done . ’
40063	40074	40076	40077	that gentleman	8945	‘ This is the new young man , my dear , ’
40079	40082	40084	40085	Mrs. Squeers	231	‘ Oh , ’
40102	40112	40114	40114	Squeers	231	‘ He ’ll take a meal with us tonight , ’
40116	40141	40114	40114	Squeers	231	‘ and go among the boys tomorrow morning . You can give him a shake - down here , tonight , ca n’t you ? ’
40142	40149	40151	40152	the lady	8485	‘ We must manage it somehow , ’
40154	40169	40151	40152	the lady	8485	‘ You do n’t much mind how you sleep , I suppose , sir ? ’
40174	40178	40179	40179	I	0	’ replied Nicholas , ‘
40184	40185	40179	40179	I	0	’ ‘
40190	40605	40151	40152	the lady	8485	’ said Mrs. Squeers . And as the lady ’s humour was considered to lie chiefly in retort , Mr. Squeers laughed heartily , and seemed to expect that Nicholas should do the same . After some further conversation between the master and mistress relative to the success of Mr. Squeers ’s trip and the people who had paid , and the people who had made default in payment , a young servant girl brought in a Yorkshire pie and some cold beef , which being set upon the table , the boy Smike appeared with a jug of ale . Mr. Squeers was emptying his great - coat pockets of letters to different boys , and other small documents , which he had brought down in them . The boy glanced , with an anxious and timid expression , at the papers , as if with a sickly hope that one among them might relate to him . The look was a very painful one , and went to Nicholas ’s heart at once ; for it told a long and very sad history . It induced him to consider the boy more attentively , and he was surprised to observe the extraordinary mixture of garments which formed his dress . Although he could not have been less than eighteen or nineteen years old , and was tall for that age , he wore a skeleton suit , such as is usually put upon very little boys , and which , though most absurdly short in the arms and legs , was quite wide enough for his attenuated frame . In order that the lower part of his legs might be in perfect keeping with this singular dress , he had a very large pair of boots , originally made for tops , which might have been once worn by some stout farmer , but were now too patched and tattered for a beggar . Heaven knows how long he had been there , but he still wore the same linen which he had first taken down ; for , round his neck , was a tattered child ’s frill , only half concealed by a coarse , man ’s neckerchief . He was lame ; and as he feigned to be busy in arranging the table , glanced at the letters with a look so keen , and yet so dispirited and hopeless , that Nicholas could hardly bear to watch him . ‘
40615	40620	40608	40608	you	1592	’ cried Mrs. Squeers ; ‘
40630	40631	40628	40628	you	1592	’ ‘
40634	40641	40628	40628	you	1592	’ said Squeers , looking up . ‘
40651	40652	40646	40646	you	1592	’ ‘
40657	40682	40646	40646	you	1592	’ replied the youth , pressing his hands together , as though to control , by force , the nervous wandering of his fingers . ‘
40685	40686	40646	40646	you	1592	’ ‘
40689	40693	40695	40695	you	1592	’ said Squeers . ‘
40708	40709	40710	40710	Devil	267	’ ‘
40714	40739	40710	40710	Devil	267	’ replied Squeers testily . The lad withdrew his eyes , and , putting his hand to his face , moved towards the door . ‘
40744	40748	40710	40710	Devil	267	’ resumed Squeers , ‘
40838	40877	40878	40878	I	0	’ The boy put his hand to his head as if he were making an effort to recollect something , and then , looking vacantly at his questioner , gradually broke into a smile , and limped away . ‘
40886	40895	40884	40884	Squeers	231	’ remarked his wife as the door closed , ‘
40905	40906	40898	40900	that young chap	1597	’ ‘
40911	40916	40898	40900	that young chap	1597	’ said the schoolmaster ; ‘
40974	41009	41015	41015	Squeers	231	’ This reminder brought in an exclusive steak for Mr. Squeers , who speedily proceeded to do it ample justice . Nicholas drew up his chair , but his appetite was effectually taken away . ‘
41017	41021	41015	41015	Squeers	231	’ said Mrs. S. ‘
41027	41031	41085	41085	you	231	’ replied Squeers . ‘
41036	41037	41038	41038	I	0	’ ‘
41045	41050	41038	41038	I	0	’ replied his wife . ‘

41070	41082	41053	41055	the young man	900	’ rejoined Squeers , in a most unusual burst of generosity . ‘
41091	41096	41085	41085	you	231	’ inquired Mrs. Squeers . ‘
41110	41114	41107	41107	you	231	’ replied Nicholas . ‘
41121	41125	41085	41085	you	231	’m not hungry . ’
41138	41146	41148	41149	Mrs. Squeers	231	’re not hungry , is n’t it ? ’
41151	41161	41148	41149	Mrs. Squeers	231	‘ Will you try a bit of the beef ? ’
41162	41167	41169	41169	Nicholas	207	‘ Whatever you please , ’
41172	41181	41169	41169	Nicholas	207	‘ it ’s all the same to me . ’
41228	41233	41235	41236	the lady	8485	‘ Ale , Squeery ? ’
41270	41273	41275	41275	Squeers	231	‘ Certainly , ’
41285	41289	41275	41275	Squeers	231	‘ A glassful . ’
41316	41322	41327	41327	he	900	‘ Uncommon juicy steak that , ’
41346	41352	41354	41355	his lady	1604	‘ It ’s prime meat , ’
41357	41370	41354	41355	his lady	1604	‘ I bought a good large piece of it myself on purpose for-- ’
41371	41375	41377	41377	Squeers	231	‘ For what ! ’
41380	41384	41377	41377	Squeers	231	‘ Not for the-- ’
41385	41394	41396	41397	Mrs. Squeers	231	‘ No , no ; not for them , ’
41399	41425	41396	41397	Mrs. Squeers	231	‘ on purpose for you against you came home . Lor ! you did n’t think I could have made such a mistake as that . ’
41426	41445	41447	41447	Squeers	231	‘ Upon my word , my dear , I did n’t know what you were going to say , ’
41454	41462	41464	41465	his wife	648	‘ You need n’t make yourself uncomfortable , ’
41470	41483	41464	41465	his wife	648	‘ To think that I should be such a noddy ! Well ! ’
41850	41863	41865	41865	Squeers	231	‘ We ’ll put you into your regular bedroom tomorrow , Nickelby , ’
41867	41882	41865	41865	Squeers	231	‘ Let me see ! Who sleeps in Brooks ’s bed , my dear ? ’
41883	41888	41890	41891	Mrs. Squeers	231	‘ In Brooks ’s , ’
41895	41911	41890	41891	Mrs. Squeers	231	‘ There ’s Jennings , little Bolder , Graymarsh , and what ’s his name . ’
41912	41917	41919	41919	Squeers	231	‘ So there is , ’
41921	41928	41919	41919	Squeers	231	‘ Yes ! Brooks is full . ’
41929	41932	41934	41934	Nicholas	207	‘ Full ! ’
41936	41943	41934	41934	Nicholas	207	‘ I should think he was . ’
41944	41954	41956	41956	Squeers	231	‘ There ’s a place somewhere , I know , ’
41958	41997	41956	41956	Squeers	231	‘ but I ca n’t at this moment call to mind where it is . However , we ’ll have that all settled tomorrow . Good - night , Nickleby . Seven o’clock in the morning , mind . ’
41998	42006	42008	42008	Nicholas	207	‘ I shall be ready , sir , ’
42010	42015	42008	42008	Nicholas	207	‘ Good - night . ’
42016	42030	42032	42032	Squeers	231	‘ I ’ll come in myself and show you where the well is , ’
42034	42054	42032	42032	Squeers	231	‘ You ’ll always find a little bit of soap in the kitchen window ; that belongs to you . ’

43015	43061	43012	43012	Squeers	203	‘ So you must be content with giving yourself a dry polish till we break the ice in the well , and can get a bucketful out for the boys . Do n’t stand staring at me , but do look sharp , will you ? ’

43283	43335	43280	43281	his lady	1604	‘ Do n’t think , young man , that we go to the expense of flower of brimstone and molasses , just to purify them ; because if you think we carry on the business in that way , you ’ll find yourself mistaken , and so I tell you plainly . ’
43336	43340	43342	43342	Squeers	231	‘ My dear , ’
43345	43348	43342	43342	Squeers	231	‘ Hem ! ’
43349	43354	43356	43357	Mrs. Squeers	231	‘ Oh ! nonsense , ’
43359	43457	43356	43357	Mrs. Squeers	231	‘ If the young man comes to be a teacher here , let him understand , at once , that we do n’t want any foolery about the boys . They have the brimstone and treacle , partly because if they had n’t something or other in the way of medicine they ’d be always ailing and giving a world of trouble , and partly because it spoils their appetites and comes cheaper than breakfast and dinner . So , it does them good and us good at the same time , and that ’s fair enough I ’m
43460	43543	43356	43357	Mrs. Squeers	231	’ Having given this explanation , Mrs. Squeers put her head into the closet and instituted a stricter search after the spoon , in which Mr. Squeers assisted . A few words passed between them while they were thus engaged , but as their voices were partially stifled by the cupboard , all that Nicholas could distinguish was , that Mr. Squeers said what Mrs. Squeers had said , was injudicious , and that Mrs. Squeers said what Mr. Squeers said , was ‘
43546	43673	43356	43357	Mrs. Squeers	231	’ A vast deal of searching and rummaging ensued , and it proving fruitless , Smike was called in , and pushed by Mrs. Squeers , and boxed by Mr. Squeers ; which course of treatment brightening his intellects , enabled him to suggest that possibly Mrs. Squeers might have the spoon in her pocket , as indeed turned out to be the case . As Mrs. Squeers had previously protested , however , that she was quite certain she had not got it , Smike received another box on the ear for presuming to contradict his mistress , together with a promise of a sound thrashing if he were not more respectful in future ; so that he took nothing very advantageous by his motion . ‘
43683	43699	43681	43681	Nickleby	207	’ said Squeers when his consort had hurried away , pushing the drudge before her . ‘
43704	43708	43702	43702	sir	714	’ observed Nicholas . ‘
43716	43720	43721	43721	I	0	’ said Squeers ; ‘
43755	43789	43752	43752	her	1649	’ Nicholas sighed involuntarily at the thought of the agreeable domestic prospect thus opened to him ; but Squeers was , fortunately , too much occupied with his own reflections to perceive it . ‘
43804	43808	43798	43798	I	0	’ continued Squeers , ‘
43858	43859	43860	43860	I	0	’ ‘
43869	44014	43867	43867	sir	714	’ answered Nicholas . Now , the fact was , that both Mr. and Mrs. Squeers viewed the boys in the light of their proper and natural enemies ; or , in other words , they held and considered that their business and profession was to get as much from every boy as could by possibility be screwed out of him . On this point they were both agreed , and behaved in unison accordingly . The only difference between them was , that Mrs. Squeers waged war against the enemy openly and fearlessly , and that Squeers covered his rascality , even at home , with a spice of his habitual deceit ; as if he really had a notion of someday or other being able to take himself in , and persuade his own mind that he was a very good fellow . ‘
44018	44038	44058	44058	you	1663	’ said Squeers , interrupting the progress of some thoughts to this effect in the mind of his usher , ‘
44060	44112	44058	44058	you	1663	’ Nicholas assisted his master to put on an old fustian shooting - jacket , which he took down from a peg in the passage ; and Squeers , arming himself with his cane , led the way across a yard , to a door in the rear of the house . ‘
44115	44125	44058	44058	you	1663	’ said the schoolmaster as they stepped in together ; ‘
44133	44934	44131	44131	Nickleby	207	’ It was such a crowded scene , and there were so many objects to attract attention , that , at first , Nicholas stared about him , really without seeing anything at all . By degrees , however , the place resolved itself into a bare and dirty room , with a couple of windows , whereof a tenth part might be of glass , the remainder being stopped up with old copy - books and paper . There were a couple of long old rickety desks , cut and notched , and inked , and damaged , in every possible way ; two or three forms ; a detached desk for Squeers ; and another for his assistant . The ceiling was supported , like that of a barn , by cross - beams and rafters ; and the walls were so stained and discoloured , that it was impossible to tell whether they had ever been touched with paint or whitewash . But the pupils -- the young noblemen ! How the last faint traces of hope , the remotest glimmering of any good to be derived from his efforts in this den , faded from the mind of Nicholas as he looked in dismay around ! Pale and haggard faces , lank and bony figures , children with the countenances of old men , deformities with irons upon their limbs , boys of stunted growth , and others whose long meagre legs would hardly bear their stooping bodies , all crowded on the view together ; there were the bleared eye , the hare - lip , the crooked foot , and every ugliness or distortion that told of unnatural aversion conceived by parents for their offspring , or of young lives which , from the earliest dawn of infancy , had been one horrible endurance of cruelty and neglect . There were little faces which should have been handsome , darkened with the scowl of sullen , dogged suffering ; there was childhood with the light of its eye quenched , its beauty gone , and its helplessness alone remaining ; there were vicious - faced boys , brooding , with leaden eyes , like malefactors in a jail ; and there were young creatures on whom the sins of their frail parents had descended , weeping even for the mercenary nurses they had known , and lonesome even in their loneliness . With every kindly sympathy and affection blasted in its birth , with every young and healthy feeling flogged and starved down , with every revengeful passion that can fester in swollen hearts , eating its evil way to their core in silence , what an incipient Hell was breeding here ! And yet this scene , painful as it was , had its grotesque features , which , in a less interested observer than Nicholas , might have provoked a smile . Mrs. Squeers stood at one of the desks , presiding over an immense basin of brimstone and treacle , of which delicious compound she administered a large instalment to each boy in succession : using for the purpose a common wooden spoon , which might have been originally manufactured for some gigantic top , and which widened every young gentleman ’s mouth considerably : they being all obliged , under heavy corporal penalties , to take in the whole of the bowl at a gasp . In another corner , huddled together for companionship , were the little boys who had arrived on the preceding night , three of them in very large leather breeches , and two in old trousers , a something tighter fit than drawers are usually worn ; at no great distance from these was seated the juvenile son and heir of Mr. Squeers -- a striking likeness of his father -- kicking , with great vigour , under the hands of Smike , who was fitting upon him a pair of new boots that bore a most suspicious resemblance to those which the least of the little boys had worn on the journey down -- as the little boy himself seemed to think , for he was regarding the appropriation with a look of most rueful amazement . Besides these , there was a long row of boys waiting , with countenances of no pleasant anticipation , to be treacled ; and another file , who had just escaped from the infliction , making a variety of wry mouths indicative of anything but satisfaction . The whole were attired in such motley , ill - assorted , extraordinary garments , as would have been irresistibly ridiculous , but for the foul appearance of dirt , disorder , and disease , with which they were associated . ‘
44937	44964	44131	44131	Nickleby	207	’ said Squeers , giving the desk a great rap with his cane , which made half the little boys nearly jump out of their boots , ‘
44970	44971	44131	44131	Nickleby	207	’ ‘
44975	45003	44131	44131	Nickleby	207	’ said Mrs. Squeers , choking the last boy in her hurry , and tapping the crown of his head with the wooden spoon to restore him . ‘
45016	45163	45171	45172	the Lord	1669	’ Smike shuffled out with the basin , and Mrs. Squeers having called up a little boy with a curly head , and wiped her hands upon it , hurried out after him into a species of wash - house , where there was a small fire and a large kettle , together with a number of little wooden bowls which were arranged upon a board . Into these bowls , Mrs. Squeers , assisted by the hungry servant , poured a brown composition , which looked like diluted pincushions without the covers , and was called porridge . A minute wedge of brown bread was inserted in each bowl , and when they had eaten their porridge by means of the bread , the boys ate the bread itself , and had finished their breakfast ; whereupon Mr. Squeers said , in a solemn voice , ‘
45335	45486	45325	45325	his	203	’ toes in his new boots , his flow of spirits was rather disagreeable than otherwise . After some half - hour ’s delay , Mr. Squeers reappeared , and the boys took their places and their books , of which latter commodity the average might be about one to eight learners . A few minutes having elapsed , during which Mr. Squeers looked very profound , as if he had a perfect apprehension of what was inside all the books , and could say every word of their contents by heart if he only chose to take the trouble , that gentleman called up the first class . Obedient to this summons there ranged themselves in front of the schoolmaster ’s desk , half - a - dozen scarecrows , out at knees and elbows , one of whom placed a torn and filthy book beneath his learned eye . ‘
45500	45511	45498	45498	Nickleby	207	’ said Squeers , beckoning Nicholas to stand beside him . ‘
45537	45538	45533	45535	the first boy	1678	’ ‘
45552	45562	45564	45564	he	1678	’ said the temporary head of the philosophical class . ‘
45571	45575	45564	45564	he	1678	’ rejoined Squeers . ‘
45669	45670	45665	45667	the second boy	1681	’ ‘
45681	45687	45675	45675	he	1681	’ replied a small voice . ‘
45692	45701	45703	45703	he	1681	’ said Squeers , by no means disconcerted . ‘
45758	45775	45734	45735	noun substantive	1685	‘ em . That ’s our system , Nickleby : what do you think of it ? ’
45776	45787	45789	45789	Nicholas	207	‘ It ’s very useful one , at any rate , ’
45791	45796	45798	45798	Squeers	231	‘ I believe you , ’
45808	45816	45798	45798	Squeers	231	‘ Third boy , what ’s horse ? ’
45817	45823	45825	45826	the boy	8822	‘ A beast , sir , ’
45828	45833	45835	45835	Squeers	231	‘ So it is , ’
45837	45844	45835	45835	Squeers	231	‘ Ai n’t it , Nickleby ? ’
45845	45857	45859	45859	Nicholas	207	‘ I believe there is no doubt of that , sir , ’
45861	45868	45870	45870	Squeers	231	‘ Of course there is n’t , ’
45872	45908	45870	45870	Squeers	231	‘ A horse is a quadruped , and quadruped ’s Latin for beast , as everybody that ’s gone through the grammar knows , or else where ’s the use of having grammars at all ? ’
45909	45914	45916	45916	Nicholas	207	‘ Where , indeed ! ’
45919	45922	45916	45916	Nicholas	207	‘ As you ’re
45927	45936	45870	45870	Squeers	231	’ resumed Squeers , turning to the boy , ‘
45991	46037	45969	45969	somebody	8568	’ So saying , he dismissed the first class to their experiments in practical philosophy , and eyed Nicholas with a look , half cunning and half doubtful , as if he were not altogether certain what he might think of him by this time . ‘
46048	46075	46046	46046	Nickleby	207	’ he said , after a pause . Nicholas shrugged his shoulders in a manner that was scarcely perceptible , and said he saw it was . ‘
46086	46090	46046	46046	Nickleby	207	’ said Squeers . ‘
46124	46497	46046	46046	Nickleby	207	’ Mr. Squeers said this , as if it had suddenly occurred to him , either that he must not say too much to his assistant , or that his assistant did not say enough to him in praise of the establishment . The children were arranged in a semicircle round the new master , and he was soon listening to their dull , drawling , hesitating recital of those stories of engrossing interest which are to be found in the more antiquated spelling - books . In this exciting occupation , the morning lagged heavily on . At one o’clock , the boys , having previously had their appetites thoroughly taken away by stir - about and potatoes , sat down in the kitchen to some hard salt beef , of which Nicholas was graciously permitted to take his portion to his own solitary desk , to eat it there in peace . After this , there was another hour of crouching in the schoolroom and shivering with cold , and then school began again . It was Mr. Squeer ’s custom to call the boys together , and make a sort of report , after every half - yearly visit to the metropolis , regarding the relations and friends he had seen , the news he had heard , the letters he had brought down , the bills which had been paid , the accounts which had been left unpaid , and so forth . This solemn proceeding always took place in the afternoon of the day succeeding his return ; perhaps , because the boys acquired strength of mind from the suspense of the morning , or , possibly , because Mr. Squeers himself acquired greater sternness and inflexibility from certain warm potations in which he was wo nt to indulge after his early dinner . Be this as it may , the boys were recalled from house - window , garden , stable , and cow - yard , and the school were assembled in full conclave , when Mr. Squeers , with a small bundle of papers in his hand , and Mrs. S. following with a pair of canes , entered the room and proclaimed silence . ‘
46507	46513	46515	46515	I	0	’ said Mr. Squeers mildly , ‘
46524	46552	46515	46515	I	0	’ This special proclamation had the desired effect , and a deathlike silence immediately prevailed , in the midst of which Mr. Squeers went on to say : ‘
46577	46608	46609	46609	I	0	’ According to half - yearly custom , the boys gave three feeble cheers at this refreshing intelligence . Such cheers ! Sights of extra strength with the chill on . ‘
46618	46627	46629	46629	they	1697	’ continued Squeers , turning over his papers , ‘
46630	46670	46724	46724	Squeers	231	’re so glad to hear how their sons are getting on , that there ’s no prospect at all of their going away , which of course is a very pleasant thing to reflect upon , for all parties . ’
46713	46722	46724	46724	Squeers	231	‘ I have had disappointments to contend against , ’
46730	46744	46724	46724	Squeers	231	‘ Bolder ’s father was two pound ten short . Where is Bolder ? ’
46745	46753	46755	46757	twenty officious voices	1700	‘ Here he is , please sir , ’
46768	46774	46776	46776	Squeers	231	‘ Come here , Bolder , ’
46824	46827	46829	46829	Squeers	231	‘ Bolder , ’
46850	46868	46873	46873	he	1703	‘ Bolder , if you father thinks that because -- why , what ’s this , sir ? ’
46899	46908	46910	46911	the schoolmaster	8373	‘ What do you call this , sir ? ’
46924	46935	46937	46938	the boy	8822	‘ I ca n’t help it , indeed , sir , ’
46942	46976	46937	46938	the boy	8822	‘ They will come ; it ’s the dirty work I think , sir -- at least I do n’t know what it is , sir , but it ’s not my fault . ’
46977	46980	46982	46982	Squeers	231	‘ Bolder , ’
47006	47008	47009	47012	an incorrigible young scoundrel	1708	‘ you ’re
47038	47075	47118	47118	you	8822	’ With this , and wholly disregarding a piteous cry for mercy , Mr. Squeers fell upon the boy and caned him soundly : not leaving off , indeed , until his arm was tired out . ‘
47078	47088	47118	47118	you	8822	’ said Squeers , when he had quite done ; ‘
47126	47176	47124	47124	Smike	264	’ The drudge knew better from long experience , than to hesitate about obeying , so he bundled the victim out by a side - door , and Mr. Squeers perched himself again on his own stool , supported by Mrs. Squeers , who occupied another at his side . ‘
47182	47186	47124	47124	Smike	264	’ said Squeers . ‘
47197	47219	47195	47195	Cobbey	278	’ Another boy stood up , and eyed the letter very hard while Squeers made a mental abstract of the same . ‘
47222	47226	47195	47195	Cobbey	278	’ said Squeers : ‘
47277	47306	47265	47266	Mrs Squeers	231	’ The worthy lady pocketed the eighteenpence with a most business - like air , and Squeers passed on to the next boy , as coolly as possible . ‘
47309	47313	47314	47314	he	274	’ said Squeers , ‘
47324	47340	47322	47322	Graymarsh	274	’ Another boy stood up , and the schoolmaster looked over the letter as before . ‘
47346	47359	47374	47374	her	1715	’ said Squeers , when he had possessed himself of the contents , ‘
47499	47507	47479	47480	Master Squeers	203	’ said Squeers , folding it up , ‘
47516	47577	47578	47578	Mobbs	280	’ It was affecting in one sense , for Graymarsh ’s maternal aunt was strongly supposed , by her more intimate friends , to be no other than his maternal parent ; Squeers , however , without alluding to this part of the story ( which would have sounded immoral before boys ) , proceeded with the business by calling out ‘
47580	47592	47578	47578	Mobbs	280	’ whereupon another boy rose , and Graymarsh resumed his seat . ‘
47599	47603	47606	47606	her	1722	’ said Squeers , ‘
47788	47789	47780	47780	she	1722	’ ‘
47796	47818	47780	47780	she	1722	’ said Squeers , after a terrible pause , during which he had moistened the palm of his right hand again , ‘
47837	47897	47831	47831	Mobbs	280	’ Mobbs moved slowly towards the desk , rubbing his eyes in anticipation of good cause for doing so ; and he soon afterwards retired by the side - door , with as good cause as a boy need have . Mr. Squeers then proceeded to open a miscellaneous collection of letters ; some enclosing money , which Mrs. Squeers ‘
47902	48568	47831	47831	Mobbs	280	’ and others referring to small articles of apparel , as caps and so forth , all of which the same lady stated to be too large , or too small , and calculated for nobody but young Squeers , who would appear indeed to have had most accommodating limbs , since everything that came into the school fitted him to a nicety . His head , in particular , must have been singularly elastic , for hats and caps of all dimensions were alike to him . This business dispatched , a few slovenly lessons were performed , and Squeers retired to his fireside , leaving Nicholas to take care of the boys in the school - room , which was very cold , and where a meal of bread and cheese was served out shortly after dark . There was a small stove at that corner of the room which was nearest to the master ’s desk , and by it Nicholas sat down , so depressed and self - degraded by the consciousness of his position , that if death could have come upon him at that time , he would have been almost happy to meet it . The cruelty of which he had been an unwilling witness , the coarse and ruffianly behaviour of Squeers even in his best moods , the filthy place , the sights and sounds about him , all contributed to this state of feeling ; but when he recollected that , being there as an assistant , he actually seemed -- no matter what unhappy train of circumstances had brought him to that pass -- to be the aider and abettor of a system which filled him with honest disgust and indignation , he loathed himself , and felt , for the moment , as though the mere consciousness of his present situation must , through all time to come , prevent his raising his head again . But , for the present , his resolve was taken , and the resolution he had formed on the preceding night remained undisturbed . He had written to his mother and sister , announcing the safe conclusion of his journey , and saying as little about Dotheboys Hall , and saying that little as cheerfully , as he possibly could . He hoped that by remaining where he was , he might do some good , even there ; at all events , others depended too much on his uncle ’s favour , to admit of his awakening his wrath just then . One reflection disturbed him far more than any selfish considerations arising out of his own position . This was the probable destination of his sister Kate . His uncle had deceived him , and might he not consign her to some miserable place where her youth and beauty would prove a far greater curse than ugliness and decrepitude ? To a caged man , bound hand and foot , this was a terrible idea -- but no , he thought , his mother was by ; there was the portrait - painter , too -- simple enough , but still living in the world , and of it . He was willing to believe that Ralph Nickleby had conceived a personal dislike to himself . Having pretty good reason , by this time , to reciprocate it , he had no great difficulty in arriving at this conclusion , and tried to persuade himself that the feeling extended no farther than between them . As he was absorbed in these meditations , he all at once encountered the upturned face of Smike , who was on his knees before the stove , picking a few stray cinders from the hearth and planting them on the fire . He had paused to steal a look at Nicholas , and when he saw that he was observed , shrunk back , as if expecting a blow . ‘
48575	48580	48569	48569	You	1727	’ said Nicholas kindly . ‘
48585	48586	48582	48582	you	1727	’ ‘
48592	48593	48594	48594	You	1727	’ ‘
48598	48599	48594	48594	You	1727	’ ‘
48605	48610	48611	48611	I	0	’ replied Smike quickly . ‘
48617	48650	48651	48652	Poor fellow	926	’ There was such an obvious fear of giving offence in his manner , and he was such a timid , broken - spirited creature , that Nicholas could not help exclaiming , ‘
48654	48680	48651	48652	Poor fellow	926	’ If he had struck the drudge , he would have slunk away without a word . But , now , he burst into tears . ‘
48687	48701	48651	48652	Poor fellow	926	’ he cried , covering his face with his cracked and horny hands . ‘
48713	48714	48707	48707	It	1729	’ ‘
48717	48728	48707	48707	It	1729	’ said Nicholas , laying his hand upon his shoulder . ‘
48744	48745	48740	48740	God	225	’ ‘
48749	48753	48762	48762	them	1731	’ cried Smike . ‘
48788	48789	48785	48785	they	1731	’ ‘
48796	48812	48792	48792	you	1733	’ inquired Nicholas , wishing to rouse the poor half - witted creature to reason . ‘
48816	48817	48792	48792	you	1733	’ ‘
48821	48825	48826	48826	myself	0	’ he replied , ‘

48845	48856	48792	48792	you	1733	’ said Nicholas ; he knew not what to say . ‘
48859	48864	48792	48792	you	1733	’ rejoined the other , ‘
48880	48881	48872	48872	you	0	’ ‘
48890	48895	48882	48882	I	0	’ said Nicholas gently ; ‘
48901	48902	48899	48899	him	1735	’ ‘
48905	48918	48899	48899	him	1735	’ replied the youth , drawing closer to his questioner ’s side , ‘

48992	48996	48983	48983	you	1733	’ rejoined Nicholas . ‘
49007	49014	48983	48983	you	1733	’ cried his companion , shivering . ‘
49076	49477	49495	49495	you	702	’ The bell rang to bed : and the boy , subsiding at the sound into his usual listless state , crept away as if anxious to avoid notice . It was with a heavy heart that Nicholas soon afterwards -- no , not retired ; there was no retirement there -- followed -- to his dirty and crowded dormitory . CHAPTER 9 Of Miss Squeers , Mrs. Squeers , Master Squeers , and Mr. Squeers ; and of various Matters and Persons connected no less with the Squeerses than Nicholas Nickleby When Mr. Squeers left the schoolroom for the night , he betook himself , as has been before remarked , to his own fireside , which was situated -- not in the room in which Nicholas had supped on the night of his arrival , but in a smaller apartment in the rear of the premises , where his lady wife , his amiable son , and accomplished daughter , were in the full enjoyment of each other ’s society ; Mrs. Squeers being engaged in the matronly pursuit of stocking - darning ; and the young lady and gentleman being occupied in the adjustment of some youthful differences , by means of a pugilistic contest across the table , which , on the approach of their honoured parent , subsided into a noiseless exchange of kicks beneath it . And , in this place , it may be as well to apprise the reader , that Miss Fanny Squeers was in her three - and - twentieth year . If there be any one grace or loveliness inseparable from that particular period of life , Miss Squeers may be presumed to have been possessed of it , as there is no reason to suppose that she was a solitary exception to an universal rule . She was not tall like her mother , but short like her father ; from the former she inherited a voice of harsh quality ; from the latter a remarkable expression of the right eye , something akin to having none at all . Miss Squeers had been spending a few days with a neighbouring friend , and had only just returned to the parental roof . To this circumstance may be referred , her having heard nothing of Nicholas , until Mr. Squeers himself now made him the subject of conversation . ‘
49483	49492	49495	49495	you	702	’ said Squeers , drawing up his chair , ‘
49503	49504	49495	49495	you	702	’ ‘
49509	49528	49495	49495	you	702	’ inquired Mrs. Squeers ; who ( as she often remarked ) was no grammarian , thank Heaven . ‘
49544	49545	49548	49549	that Knuckleboy	1746	’ ‘
49551	49557	49548	49549	that Knuckleboy	1746	’ said Mrs. Squeers impatiently . ‘
49562	49563	49558	49558	I	0	’ ‘
49574	49578	49566	49566	you	702	’ asked Squeers . ‘
49585	49590	49566	49566	you	702	’ retorted Mrs. Squeers . ‘
49604	49605	49566	49566	you	702	’ ‘
49629	49637	49625	49625	he	900	’ replied Squeers in a pacific tone . ‘
49647	49648	49625	49625	he	900	’ ‘
49659	49664	49665	49665	I	0	’ rejoined Mrs. Squeers , ‘
49687	49818	49819	49819	Hem	233	’ Mrs. Squeers , when excited , was accustomed to use strong language , and , moreover , to make use of a plurality of epithets , some of which were of a figurative kind , as the word peacock , and furthermore the allusion to Nicholas ’s nose , which was not intended to be taken in its literal sense , but rather to bear a latitude of construction according to the fancy of the hearers . Neither were they meant to bear reference to each other , so much as to the object on whom they were bestowed , as will be seen in the present case : a peacock with a turned - up nose being a novelty in ornithology , and a thing not commonly seen . ‘
49821	49834	49819	49819	Hem	233	’ said Squeers , as if in mild deprecation of this outbreak . ‘
49849	49850	49819	49819	Hem	233	’ ‘
49857	49862	49819	49819	Hem	233	’ retorted Mrs. Squeers . ‘
49868	49872	49819	49819	Hem	233	’ said Squeers . ‘
49891	49896	49881	49881	you	702	’ replied his wife . ‘
49903	49907	49908	49908	I	0	’ urged Squeers . ‘
49922	49927	49913	49913	you	702	’ said Mrs. Squeers . ‘

49989	49995	49987	49987	you	702	’ said Squeers , sternly . ‘

50105	50130	50103	50103	father	1260	’ said Wackford junior , suspending , in the excess of his delight , a vicious kick which he was administering to his sister . ‘
50137	50147	50131	50131	You	1768	’ replied Mr. Squeers , in a sentimental voice . ‘
50161	50173	50154	50154	I	0	’ exclaimed the interesting child , grasping his father ’s cane . ‘
50182	50187	50180	50180	I	0	‘ em squeak again ! ’
50276	50293	50295	50296	Mrs Squeers	231	‘ He ’s a nasty stuck - up monkey , that ’s what I consider him , ’
50302	50307	50309	50309	Squeers	231	‘ Supposing he is , ’
50311	50335	50309	50309	Squeers	231	‘ he is as well stuck up in our schoolroom as anywhere else , is n’t he?--especially as he do n’t like it . ’
50336	50339	50341	50342	Mrs. Squeers	231	‘ Well , ’
50344	50373	50341	50342	Mrs. Squeers	231	‘ there ’s something in that . I hope it ’ll bring his pride down , and it shall be no fault of mine if it do n’t . ’
50446	50449	50451	50451	Squeers	231	‘ Nickleby , ’
50468	50481	50451	50451	Squeers	231	‘ your mother always calls things and people by their wrong names . ’
50482	50488	50490	50491	Mrs. Squeers	231	‘ No matter for that , ’
50493	50570	50490	50491	Mrs. Squeers	231	‘ I see them with right eyes , and that ’s quite enough for me . I watched him when you were laying on to little Bolder this afternoon . He looked as black as thunder , all the while , and , one time , started up as if he had more than got it in his mind to make a rush at you . I saw him , though he thought I did n’t . ’
50571	50578	50580	50581	Miss Squeers	282	‘ Never mind that , father , ’
50594	50600	50580	50581	Miss Squeers	282	‘ Who is the man ? ’
50601	50628	50630	50631	Mrs. Squeers	231	‘ Why , your father has got some nonsense in his head that he ’s the son of a poor gentleman that died the other day , ’
50633	50640	50630	50631	Mrs. Squeers	231	‘ The son of a gentleman ! ’
50641	50674	50580	50581	Miss Squeers	282	‘ Yes ; but I do n’t believe a word of it . If he ’s a gentleman ’s son at all , he ’s a fondling , that ’s my opinion . ’
50675	50681	50580	50581	Miss Squeers	282	‘ Mrs. Squeers intended to say ‘
50684	50738	50580	50581	Miss Squeers	282	’ but , as she frequently remarked when she made any such mistake , it would be all the same a hundred years hence ; with which axiom of philosophy , indeed , she was in the constant habit of consoling the boys when they laboured under more than ordinary ill - usage . ‘
50746	50757	50580	50581	Miss Squeers	282	’ said Squeers , in answer to the above remark , ‘
50823	50824	50825	50825	I	0	’ ‘
50836	50842	50825	50825	I	0	’ said Mrs. Squeers vehemently . ‘
50851	50855	50844	50844	you	0	’ returned Squeers , ‘
50888	50889	50890	50890	I	0	’ ‘
50900	50904	50896	50896	I	0	’ interposed Mrs. S. ‘
50909	50913	50916	50916	he	1783	’ said Squeers ; ‘
50958	51142	50952	50952	you	0	’ Mrs. Squeers chuckled vastly on the receipt of these flattering compliments , and said , she hoped she had tamed a high spirit or two in her day . It is but due to her character to say , that in conjunction with her estimable husband , she had broken many and many a one . Miss Fanny Squeers carefully treasured up this , and much more conversation on the same subject , until she retired for the night , when she questioned the hungry servant , minutely , regarding the outward appearance and demeanour of Nicholas ; to which queries the girl returned such enthusiastic replies , coupled with so many laudatory remarks touching his beautiful dark eyes , and his sweet smile , and his straight legs -- upon which last - named articles she laid particular stress ; the general run of legs at Dotheboys Hall being crooked -- that Miss Squeers was not long in arriving at the conclusion that the new usher must be a very remarkable person , or , as she herself significantly phrased it , ‘
51150	51229	50952	50952	you	0	’ And so Miss Squeers made up her mind that she would take a personal observation of Nicholas the very next day . In pursuance of this design , the young lady watched the opportunity of her mother being engaged , and her father absent , and went accidentally into the schoolroom to get a pen mended : where , seeing nobody but Nicholas presiding over the boys , she blushed very deeply , and exhibited great confusion . ‘
51235	51240	50952	50952	you	0	’ faltered Miss Squeers ; ‘
51258	51259	51260	51261	Mr. Squeers	203	’ ‘
51265	51282	51260	51261	Mr. Squeers	203	’ said Nicholas , by no means overcome by the apparition , unexpected though it was . ‘
51293	51302	51303	51303	He	8479	’ asked Miss Squeers , with bashful hesitation . ‘
51309	51333	51303	51303	He	8479	’ replied Nicholas -- politely of course , but without any indication of being stricken to the heart by Miss Squeers ’s charms . ‘
51342	51348	51334	51334	I	0	’ exclaimed the young lady . ‘
51392	51421	51359	51359	I	0	’ murmured Miss Squeers , blushing once more , and glancing , from the pen in her hand , to Nicholas at his desk , and back again . ‘
51429	51456	51426	51426	you	1793	’ said Nicholas , pointing to the pen , and smiling , in spite of himself , at the affected embarrassment of the schoolmaster ’s daughter , ‘
51464	51529	51458	51458	I	0	’ Miss Squeers glanced at the door , as if dubious of the propriety of advancing any nearer to an utter stranger ; then round the schoolroom , as though in some measure reassured by the presence of forty boys ; and finally sidled up to Nicholas and delivered the pen into his hand , with a most winning mixture of reserve and condescension . ‘
51540	51552	51553	51553	He	8479	’ inquired Nicholas , smiling to prevent himself from laughing outright . ‘
51559	51564	51567	51567	you	0	’ thought Miss Squeers . ‘
51570	51574	51567	51567	you	0	’ asked Nicholas . ‘
51591	51596	51588	51588	I	0	’ replied Miss Squeers . ‘
51608	51707	51711	51711	me	0	’ With which words , Miss Squeers sighed . It might be , to give Nicholas to understand that her heart was soft , and that the pen was wanted to match . Upon these instructions Nicholas made the pen ; when he gave it to Miss Squeers , Miss Squeers dropped it ; and when he stooped to pick it up , Miss Squeers stooped also , and they knocked their heads together ; whereat five - and - twenty little boys laughed aloud : being positively for the first and only time that half - year . ‘
51713	51727	51711	51711	me	0	’ said Nicholas , opening the door for the young lady ’s retreat . ‘
51734	51739	51732	51732	sir	714	’ replied Miss Squeers ; ‘
51759	51760	51748	51748	my	0	’ ‘
51763	51767	51748	51748	my	0	’ said Nicholas . ‘
51794	51795	51786	51786	You	0	’ ‘
51798	51803	51786	51786	You	0	’ said Miss Squeers ; ‘
51822	51823	51811	51811	I	0	’ ‘
51832	51841	51811	51811	I	0	’ replied Nicholas , closing the schoolroom door . ‘
51855	52303	51842	51842	I	0	’ said Miss Squeers , as she walked away . In fact , Miss Squeers was in love with Nicholas Nickleby . To account for the rapidity with which this young lady had conceived a passion for Nicholas , it may be necessary to state , that the friend from whom she had so recently returned , was a miller ’s daughter of only eighteen , who had contracted herself unto the son of a small corn - factor , resident in the nearest market town . Miss Squeers and the miller ’s daughter , being fast friends , had covenanted together some two years before , according to a custom prevalent among young ladies , that whoever was first engaged to be married , should straightway confide the mighty secret to the bosom of the other , before communicating it to any living soul , and bespeak her as bridesmaid without loss of time ; in fulfilment of which pledge the miller ’s daughter , when her engagement was formed , came out express , at eleven o’clock at night as the corn - factor ’s son made an offer of his hand and heart at twenty - five minutes past ten by the Dutch clock in the kitchen , and rushed into Miss Squeers ’s bedroom with the gratifying intelligence . Now , Miss Squeers being five years older , and out of her teens ( which is also a great matter ) , had , since , been more than commonly anxious to return the compliment , and possess her friend with a similar secret ; but , either in consequence of finding it hard to please herself , or harder still to please anybody else , had never had an opportunity so to do , inasmuch as she had no such secret to disclose . The little interview with Nicholas had no sooner passed , as above described , however , than Miss Squeers , putting on her bonnet , made her way , with great precipitation , to her friend ’s house , and , upon a solemn renewal of divers old vows of secrecy , revealed how that she was -- not exactly engaged , but going to be -- to a gentleman ’s son--(none of your corn - factors , but a gentleman ’s son of high descent)--who had come down as teacher to Dotheboys Hall , under most mysterious and remarkable circumstances -- indeed , as Miss Squeers more than once hinted she had good reason to believe , induced , by the fame of her many charms , to seek her out , and woo and win her . ‘
52311	52321	51842	51842	I	0	’ said Miss Squeers , emphasising the adjective strongly . ‘
52325	52330	51842	51842	I	0	’ replied the friend . ‘
52339	52340	52334	52334	he	1800	’ ‘
52352	52357	52346	52346	he	1800	’ rejoined Miss Squeers . ‘
52378	52379	52368	52368	I	0	’ ‘
52387	52411	52381	52381	he	1800	’ inquired the miller ’s daughter , counterfeiting , as nearly as she could , a favourite leer of the corn - factor . ‘
52420	52425	52381	52381	he	1800	’ replied Miss Squeers . ‘
52428	52433	52435	52435	he	1800	’ said the friend , ‘
52443	52600	52435	52435	he	1800	’ Miss Squeers , having slight misgivings on the subject , was by no means ill pleased to be confirmed by a competent authority ; and discovering , on further conversation and comparison of notes , a great many points of resemblance between the behaviour of Nicholas , and that of the corn - factor , grew so exceedingly confidential , that she intrusted her friend with a vast number of things Nicholas had NOT said , which were all so very complimentary as to be quite conclusive . Then , she dilated on the fearful hardship of having a father and mother strenuously opposed to her intended husband ; on which unhappy circumstance she dwelt at great length ; for the friend ’s father and mother were quite agreeable to her being married , and the whole courtship was in consequence as flat and common - place an affair as it was possible to imagine . ‘
52609	52614	52435	52435	he	1800	’ exclaimed the friend . ‘
52619	52622	52624	52625	Miss Squeers	282	‘ Tilda , ’
52627	52681	52624	52625	Miss Squeers	282	‘ I should consider myself one of the most ungrateful creatures alive , if I denied you . I think mother ’s going away for two days to fetch some boys ; and when she does , I ’ll ask you and John up to tea , and have him to meet you . ’

53163	53168	53161	53161	Tilda	284	’ said Miss Squeers . ‘
53176	53181	53182	53182	He	1819	’ replied the friend . ‘

53201	53206	53196	53196	I	0	’ observed Miss Squeers . ‘

53315	53317	53309	53309	Tilda	284	’ said ‘

53329	53333	53335	53336	Miss Squeers	282	‘ Come in , ’

53361	53368	53351	53353	that young gentleman	1826	‘ I understood from Mr. Squeers that-- ’
53369	53378	53380	53381	Miss Squeers	282	‘ Oh yes ; it ’s all right , ’

53589	53600	53602	53604	the young lady	893	‘ But if it ’s caused by my being here , ’

53776	53816	53774	53774	Nicholas	207	‘ as I am here , and seem expected , for some reason or other , to be amiable , it ’s of no use looking like a goose . I may as well accommodate myself to the company . ’
53964	53969	53971	53973	Miss Matilda Price	285	‘ Well , John , ’
53993	53996	53998	53998	John	202	‘ Weel , ’

54140	54206	54207	54207	Ye	1853	’ said Mr. Browdie , with his mouth full . Miss Squeers nodded assent . Mr. Browdie gave a grin of special width , as if he thought that really was something to laugh at , and went to work at the bread and butter with increased vigour . It was quite a sight to behold how he and Nicholas emptied the plate between them . ‘
54221	54257	54258	54258	Ecod	287	’ said Mr Browdie , after he had sat staring at Nicholas a long time over the empty plate . Nicholas bit his lip , and coloured , but affected not to hear the remark . ‘
54260	54268	54258	54258	Ecod	287	’ said Mr. Browdie , laughing boisterously , ‘

54573	54581	54583	54584	Miss Price	285	‘ What ’s the matter , Fanny ? ’
54586	54589	54583	54584	Miss Price	285	‘ Nothing , ‘
54592	54599	54590	54590	Tilda	284	’ replied Miss Squeers , sobbing . ‘
54606	54611	54615	54616	Mr. Nickleby	208	’ said Miss Price , ‘

54624	54628	54590	54590	Tilda	284	’ replied Nicholas . ‘
54631	54632	54590	54590	Tilda	284	’ ‘
54637	54642	54590	54590	Tilda	284	’ whispered Miss Price , ‘
54673	54674	54661	54661	I	0	’ ‘
54680	54690	54590	54590	Tilda	284	’ rejoined Nicholas , quite alarmed at the proposition . ‘
54700	54701	54695	54695	you	0	’ ‘
54704	54727	54695	54695	you	0	’ said Miss Price , beckoning him aside , and speaking with some degree of contempt--‘you ARE a one to keep company . ’
54728	54734	54736	54736	Nicholas	207	‘ What do you mean ? ’
54738	54762	54736	54736	Nicholas	207	‘ I am not a one to keep company at all -- here at all events . I ca n’t make this out . ’
54763	54770	54772	54773	Miss Price	285	‘ No , nor I neither , ’
54775	54800	54772	54773	Miss Price	285	‘ but men are always fickle , and always were , and always will be ; that I can make out , very easily . ’
54801	54804	54806	54806	Nicholas	207	‘ Fickle ! ’
54808	54823	54806	54806	Nicholas	207	‘ what do you suppose ? You do n’t mean to say that you think-- ’
54824	54834	54836	54837	Miss Price	285	‘ Oh no , I think nothing at all , ’
54841	54864	54836	54837	Miss Price	285	‘ Look at her , dressed so beautiful and looking so well -- really ALMOST handsome . I am ashamed at you . ’
54865	54884	54886	54886	Nicholas	207	‘ My dear girl , what have I got to do with her dressing beautifully or looking well ? ’
54888	54899	54901	54902	Miss Price	285	‘ Come , do n’t call me a dear girl , ’
54970	54979	54969	54969	we	1865	’re going to have a game at cards . ’
55068	55076	55077	55077	Tilda	284	‘ There are only four of us , ‘
55079	55089	55077	55077	Tilda	284	’ said Miss Squeers , looking slyly at Nicholas ; ‘
55101	55102	55105	55105	you	207	’ ‘
55111	55116	55105	55105	you	207	’ inquired Miss Price . ‘
55124	55170	55171	55172	Mr. Browdie	202	’ replied Nicholas . And so saying , quite unconscious of his heinous offence , he amalgamated into one common heap those portions of a Dotheboys Hall card of terms , which represented his own counters , and those allotted to Miss Price , respectively . ‘
55174	55180	55171	55172	Mr. Browdie	202	’ said Miss Squeers hysterically , ‘
55189	55230	55231	55231	We	1865	’ The Yorkshireman assented -- apparently quite overwhelmed by the new usher ’s impudence -- and Miss Squeers darted a spiteful look at her friend , and giggled convulsively . The deal fell to Nicholas , and the hand prospered . ‘
55237	55241	55301	55302	Miss Squeers	282	’ said he . ‘
55242	55261	55263	55264	Miss Squeers	282	’ Tilda HAS won something she did n’t expect , I think , have n’t you , dear ? ’
55268	55277	55279	55280	Miss Price	285	‘ Only a dozen and eight , love , ’
55292	55299	55301	55302	Miss Squeers	282	‘ How dull you are tonight ! ’
55304	55309	55311	55312	Miss Price	285	‘ No , indeed , ’
55314	55330	55311	55312	Miss Price	285	‘ I am in excellent spirits . I was thinking YOU seemed out of sorts . ’
55331	55334	55336	55337	Miss Squeers	282	‘ Me ! ’
55349	55353	55361	55362	Miss Price	285	‘ Oh no ! ’
55354	55359	55361	55362	Miss Price	285	‘ That ’s well , ’
55364	55375	55361	55362	Miss Price	285	‘ Your hair ’s coming out of curl , dear . ’
55376	55381	55383	55384	Miss Squeers	282	‘ Never mind me , ’
55386	55395	55383	55384	Miss Squeers	282	‘ you had better attend to your partner . ’
55396	55403	55405	55405	Nicholas	207	‘ Thank you for reminding her , ’
55407	55412	55405	55405	Nicholas	207	‘ So she had . ’
55481	55490	55493	55494	Miss Price	285	‘ I never had such luck , really , ’
55502	55527	55493	55494	Miss Price	285	‘ It ’s all along of you , Mr. Nickleby , I think . I should like to have you for a partner always . ’
55528	55534	55587	55588	Miss Squeers	282	‘ I wish you had . ’
55535	55552	55554	55555	Miss Price	285	‘ You ’ll have a bad wife , though , if you always win at cards , ’
55557	55565	55567	55567	Nicholas	207	‘ Not if your wish is gratified , ’
55569	55583	55567	55567	Nicholas	207	‘ I am sure I shall have a good one in that case . ’
55645	55657	55659	55659	Nicholas	207	‘ We have all the talking to ourselves , it seems , ’
55679	55686	55688	55689	Miss Squeers	282	‘ You do it so well , ’
55691	55714	55688	55689	Miss Squeers	282	‘ that it would be a pity to interrupt , would n’t it , Mr. Browdie ? He ! he ! he ! ’
55715	55718	55720	55720	Nicholas	207	‘ Nay , ’
55722	55736	55720	55720	Nicholas	207	‘ we do it in default of having anybody else to talk to . ’
55737	55753	55755	55756	Miss Price	285	‘ We ’ll talk to you , you know , if you ’ll say anything , ’
55758	55762	55755	55756	Miss Price	285	‘ Thank you , ‘
55767	55774	55765	55765	dear	9456	’ retorted Miss Squeers , majestically . ‘
55793	55803	55784	55784	you	9456	’ said Miss Price , rallying her dear friend . ‘
55813	55814	55809	55809	you	9456	’ ‘
55818	55823	55784	55784	you	9456	’ repeated the Yorkshireman . ‘
55835	55836	55784	55784	you	9456	’ ‘
55841	55854	55784	55784	you	9456	’ said the Yorkshireman , striking the table heavily with his fist , ‘
55870	55880	55856	55856	I	0	’ this ony longer . Do ye gang whoam wi ’
55888	55908	55856	55856	I	0	’ toight young whipster look sharp out for a brokken head , next time he cums under my hond . ’
55909	55919	55921	55922	Miss Price	285	‘ Mercy on us , what ’s all this ? ’
55928	55933	55921	55922	Miss Price	285	‘ Cum whoam , tell ‘
55939	56219	55921	55922	Miss Price	285	’ replied the Yorkshireman , sternly . And as he delivered the reply , Miss Squeers burst into a shower of tears ; arising in part from desperate vexation , and in part from an impotent desire to lacerate somebody ’s countenance with her fair finger - nails . This state of things had been brought about by divers means and workings . Miss Squeers had brought it about , by aspiring to the high state and condition of being matrimonially engaged , without good grounds for so doing ; Miss Price had brought it about , by indulging in three motives of action : first , a desire to punish her friend for laying claim to a rivalship in dignity , having no good title : secondly , the gratification of her own vanity , in receiving the compliments of a smart young man : and thirdly , a wish to convince the corn - factor of the great danger he ran , in deferring the celebration of their expected nuptials ; while Nicholas had brought it about , by half an hour ’s gaiety and thoughtlessness , and a very sincere desire to avoid the imputation of inclining at all to Miss Squeers . So the means employed , and the end produced , were alike the most natural in the world ; for young ladies will look forward to being married , and will jostle each other in the race to the altar , and will avail themselves of all opportunities of displaying their own attractions to the best advantage , down to the very end of time , as they have done from its beginning . ‘
56230	56241	56225	56225	Fanny	282	’ exclaimed Miss Price , as if in fresh amazement . ‘
56248	56249	56225	56225	Fanny	282	’ ‘
56274	56291	56270	56270	yourself	1880	’ said Miss Squeers , producing that change of countenance which children call making a face . ‘
56295	56298	56300	56301	Miss Price	285	’m sure ! ’
56303	56316	56318	56319	Miss Squeers	282	‘ And who cares whether you are sure or not , ma’am ? ’
56325	56333	56335	56336	Miss Price	285	‘ You are monstrous polite , ma’am , ’
56338	56354	56356	56357	Miss Squeers	282	‘ I shall not come to you to take lessons in the art , ma’am ! ’
56359	56378	56356	56357	Miss Squeers	282	‘ You need n’t take the trouble to make yourself plainer than you are , ma’am , however , ’
56383	56390	56380	56381	Miss Price	285	‘ because that ’s quite unnecessary . ’
56476	56477	56468	56468	she	285	‘ ’
56480	56487	56478	56478	Tilda	284	’ exclaimed Miss Squeers with dignity , ‘
56492	56493	56488	56488	I	0	’ ‘
56508	56521	56504	56504	I	0	’ said Miss Price , tying her bonnet strings with a jerk . ‘
56531	56539	56530	56530	I	0	’m gone ; you know you will . ’
56540	56548	56550	56551	Miss Squeers	282	‘ I scorn your words , Minx , ’
56553	56565	56550	56551	Miss Squeers	282	‘ You pay me a great compliment when you say so , ’
56576	56594	56550	56551	Miss Squeers	282	‘ Wish you a very good - night , ma’am , and pleasant dreams attend your sleep ! ’
56740	56746	56748	56748	Nicholas	207	‘ This is one consequence , ’
56763	56800	56751	56751	he	1892	‘ of my cursed readiness to adapt myself to any society in which chance carries me . If I had sat mute and motionless , as I might have done , this would not have happened . ’
56813	56818	56819	56819	he	1892	‘ I was glad , ’
56822	56890	56819	56819	he	1892	‘ to grasp at any relief from the sight of this dreadful place , or the presence of its vile master . I have set these people by the ears , and made two new enemies , where , Heaven knows , I needed none . Well , it is a just punishment for having forgotten , even for an hour , what is around me now ! ’
57073	57082	57084	57086	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ I think I have caught it now , ’
57088	57106	57084	57086	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ The very shade ! This will be the sweetest portrait I have ever done , certainly . ’
57107	57124	57126	57126	Kate	210	‘ It will be your genius that makes it so , then , I am sure , ’
57130	57144	57146	57148	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ No , no , I wo n’t allow that , my dear , ’
57150	57178	57146	57148	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ It ’s a very nice subject -- a very nice subject , indeed -- though , of course , something depends upon the mode of treatment . ’
57179	57185	57187	57187	Kate	210	‘ And not a little , ’
57189	57200	57202	57204	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ Why , my dear , you are right there , ’
57206	57246	57202	57204	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ in the main you are right there ; though I do n’t allow that it is of such very great importance in the present case . Ah ! The difficulties of Art , my dear , are great . ’
57247	57257	57259	57259	Kate	210	‘ They must be , I have no doubt , ’
57269	57282	57284	57286	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ They are beyond anything you can form the faintest conception of , ’
57288	57333	57284	57286	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ What with bringing out eyes with all one ’s power , and keeping down noses with all one ’s force , and adding to heads , and taking away teeth altogether , you have no idea of the trouble one little miniature is . ’
57334	57342	57344	57344	Kate	210	‘ The remuneration can scarcely repay you , ’
57346	57359	57344	57344	Kate	210	‘ Why , it does not , and that ’s the truth , ’
57365	57455	57344	57344	Kate	210	‘ and then people are so dissatisfied and unreasonable , that , nine times out of ten , there ’s no pleasure in painting them . Sometimes they say , “ Oh , how very serious you have made me look , Miss La Creevy ! ” and at others , “ La , Miss La Creevy , how very smirking ! ” when the very essence of a good portrait is , that it must be either serious or smirking , or it ’s no portrait at all . ’
57456	57459	57461	57461	Kate	210	‘ Indeed ! ’
57465	57483	57485	57487	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ Certainly , my dear ; because the sitters are always either the one or the other , ’
57489	57565	57567	57569	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ Look at the Royal Academy ! All those beautiful shiny portraits of gentlemen in black velvet waistcoats , with their fists doubled up on round tables , or marble slabs , are serious , you know ; and all the ladies who are playing with little parasols , or little dogs , or little children -- it ’s the same rule in art , only varying the objects -- are smirking . In fact , ’
57579	57628	57572	57572	her	222	‘ there are only two styles of portrait painting ; the serious and the smirk ; and we always use the serious for professional people ( except actors sometimes ) , and the smirk for private ladies and gentlemen who do n’t care so much about looking clever . ’
57651	57662	57664	57664	Kate	210	‘ What a number of officers you seem to paint ! ’
57681	57688	57690	57692	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ Number of what , child ? ’
57700	57716	57690	57692	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ Character portraits , oh yes -- they’re not real military men , you know . ’
57717	57720	57690	57692	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ No ! ’
57721	57757	57759	57761	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ Bless your heart , of course not ; only clerks and that , who hire a uniform coat to be painted in , and send it here in a carpet bag . Some artists , ’
57763	57798	57800	57800	herself	222	‘ keep a red coat , and charge seven - and - sixpence extra for hire and carmine ; but I do n’t do that myself , for I do n’t consider it legitimate . ’
57874	57877	57878	57878	she	222	‘ not , ’
57882	57937	57878	57878	she	222	‘ that you should make it up for painting , my dear , but because it ’s our custom sometimes to tell sitters what part we are upon , in order that if there ’s any particular expression they want introduced , they may throw it in , at the time , you know . ’
57938	57942	57944	57946	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ And when , ’
57966	57977	57944	57946	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ when do you expect to see your uncle again ? ’
57978	57993	57995	57995	Kate	210	‘ I scarcely know ; I had expected to have seen him before now , ’
57997	58012	57995	57995	Kate	210	‘ Soon I hope , for this state of uncertainty is worse than anything . ’
58013	58024	58026	58028	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ I suppose he has money , has n’t he ? ’
58030	58040	58042	58042	Kate	210	‘ He is very rich , I have heard , ’
58044	58058	58042	58042	Kate	210	‘ I do n’t know that he is , but I believe so . ’
58059	58078	58080	58082	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ Ah , you may depend upon it he is , or he would n’t be so surly , ’
58095	58109	58080	58082	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ When a man ’s a bear , he is generally pretty independent . ’
58110	58116	58118	58118	Kate	210	‘ His manner is rough , ’
58120	58123	58125	58127	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ Rough ! ’
58129	58150	58125	58127	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ a porcupine ’s a featherbed to him ! I never met with such a cross - grained old savage . ’
58151	58161	58163	58163	Kate	210	‘ It is only his manner , I believe , ’
58167	58207	58163	58163	Kate	210	‘ he was disappointed in early life , I think I have heard , or has had his temper soured by some calamity . I should be sorry to think ill of him until I knew he deserved it . ’
58208	58218	58220	58222	the miniature painter	1905	‘ Well ; that ’s very right and proper , ’
58224	58295	58220	58222	the miniature painter	1905	‘ and Heaven forbid that I should be the cause of your doing so ! But , now , might n’t he , without feeling it himself , make you and your mama some nice little allowance that would keep you both comfortable until you were well married , and be a little fortune to her afterwards ? What would a hundred a year for instance , be to him ? ’
58296	58308	58310	58310	Kate	210	‘ I do n’t know what it would be to him , ’
58315	58330	58310	58310	Kate	210	‘ but it would be that to me I would rather die than take . ’
58331	58334	58336	58338	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ Heyday ! ’
58340	58346	58348	58348	Kate	210	‘ A dependence upon him , ’
58350	58366	58348	58348	Kate	210	‘ would embitter my whole life . I should feel begging a far less degradation . ’
58367	58370	58372	58374	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ Well ! ’
58376	58403	58372	58374	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ This of a relation whom you will not hear an indifferent person speak ill of , my dear , sounds oddly enough , I confess . ’
58404	58411	58413	58413	Kate	210	‘ I dare say it does , ’
58419	58464	58413	58413	Kate	210	‘ indeed I am sure it must . I -- I -- only mean that with the feelings and recollection of better times upon me , I could not bear to live on anybody ’s bounty -- not his particularly , but anybody ’s . ’
58501	58508	58510	58510	Kate	210	‘ I only ask of him , ’
58519	58602	58510	58510	Kate	210	‘ that he will move so little out of his way , in my behalf , as to enable me by his recommendation -- only by his recommendation -- to earn , literally , my bread and remain with my mother . Whether we shall ever taste happiness again , depends upon the fortunes of my dear brother ; but if he will do this , and Nicholas only tells us that he is well and cheerful , I shall be contented . ’
58632	58633	58625	58630	some person knocked at the wainscot	1908	’ ‘
58641	58676	58625	58630	some person knocked at the wainscot	1908	’ cried Miss La Creevy . The person complied , and , coming forward at once , gave to view the form and features of no less an individual than Mr. Ralph Nickleby himself . ‘
58682	58693	58625	58630	some person knocked at the wainscot	1908	’ said Ralph , looking sharply at them by turns . ‘
58709	58808	58809	58809	I	0	’ When the man of business had a more than commonly vicious snarl lurking at his heart , he had a trick of almost concealing his eyes under their thick and protruding brows , for an instant , and then displaying them in their full keenness . As he did so now , and tried to keep down the smile which parted his thin compressed lips , and puckered up the bad lines about his mouth , they both felt certain that some part , if not the whole , of their recent conversation , had been overheard . ‘
58827	58842	58809	58809	I	0	’ said Ralph , addressing his niece , and looking contemptuously at the portrait . ‘

58861	58873	58850	58850	ma’am	8678	’ said Miss La Creevy , with a very sprightly air , ‘
58903	58904	58895	58895	I	0	’ ‘
58917	58924	58908	58908	yourself	8685	’ cried Ralph , moving away , ‘
58937	58938	58973	58973	ma’am	8678	’ ‘
58943	58961	58973	58973	ma’am	8678	’ replied Miss La Creevy , considering with the pencil end of her brush in her mouth . ‘
58966	58967	58973	58973	ma’am	8678	’ ‘
58975	58979	58973	58973	ma’am	8678	’ said Ralph . ‘
59011	59012	59004	59004	you	8685	’ ‘
59024	59025	59013	59013	I	0	’ ‘
59062	59072	59061	59061	you	702	’re ready , we ’ll lose no more time . ’
59150	59162	59164	59164	Ralph	208	‘ I have found a situation for your daughter , ma’am , ’
59166	59169	59171	59172	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ Well , ’
59174	59266	59171	59172	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ Now , I will say that that is only just what I have expected of you . “ Depend upon it , ” I said to Kate , only yesterday morning at breakfast , “ that after your uncle has provided , in that most ready manner , for Nicholas , he will not leave us until he has done at least the same for you . ” These were my very words , as near as I remember . Kate , my dear , why do n’t you thank your-- ’
59267	59276	59278	59278	Ralph	208	‘ Let me proceed , ma’am , pray , ’
59295	59306	59308	59309	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ Kate , my love , let your uncle proceed , ’
59311	59322	59324	59324	Kate	210	‘ I am most anxious that he should , mama , ’
59326	59357	59359	59360	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ Well , my dear , if you are anxious that he should , you had better allow your uncle to say what he has to say , without interruption , ’
59369	59449	59359	59360	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ Your uncle ’s time is very valuable , my dear ; and however desirous you may be -- and naturally desirous , as I am sure any affectionate relations who have seen so little of your uncle as we have , must naturally be to protract the pleasure of having him among us , still , we are bound not to be selfish , but to take into consideration the important nature of his occupations in the city . ’
59450	59461	59463	59463	Ralph	208	‘ I am very much obliged to you , ma’am , ’
59470	59506	59463	59463	Ralph	208	‘ An absence of business habits in this family leads , apparently , to a great waste of words before business -- when it does come under consideration -- is arrived at , at all . ’
59507	59515	59517	59518	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ I fear it is so indeed , ’
59523	59527	59517	59518	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ Your poor brother-- ’
59528	59535	59537	59537	Ralph	208	‘ My poor brother , ma’am , ’
59540	59563	59537	59537	Ralph	208	‘ had no idea what business was -- was unacquainted , I verily believe , with the very meaning of the word . ’
59564	59570	59572	59573	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ I fear he was , ’
59582	59602	59576	59576	her	207	‘ If it had n’t been for me , I do n’t know what would have become of him . ’
59760	59769	59771	59771	Ralph	208	‘ Repining is of no use , ma’am , ’
59773	59795	59771	59771	Ralph	208	‘ Of all fruitless errands , sending a tear to look after a day that is gone is the most fruitless . ’
59796	59801	59803	59804	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ So it is , ’
59806	59811	59803	59804	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ So it is . ’
59812	59835	59837	59837	Ralph	208	‘ As you feel so keenly , in your own purse and person , the consequences of inattention to business , ma’am , ’
59839	59860	59837	59837	Ralph	208	‘ I am sure you will impress upon your children the necessity of attaching themselves to it early in life . ’
59861	59869	59871	59872	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ Of course I must see that , ’
59874	59910	59871	59872	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ Sad experience , you know , brother - in - law.--Kate , my dear , put that down in the next letter to Nicholas , or remind me to do it if I write . ’
59945	59970	59921	59921	he	208	‘ The situation that I have made interest to procure , ma’am , is with -- with a milliner and dressmaker , in short . ’
59971	59975	59977	59978	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ A milliner ! ’
59980	59988	59990	59990	Ralph	208	‘ A milliner and dressmaker , ma’am , ’
59992	60037	59990	59990	Ralph	208	‘ Dressmakers in London , as I need not remind you , ma’am , who are so well acquainted with all matters in the ordinary routine of life , make large fortunes , keep equipages , and become persons of great wealth and fortune . ’
60139	60143	60133	60133	she	207	‘ Very true , ’
60150	60164	60166	60167	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ What your uncle says is very true , Kate , my dear , ’
60169	60274	60166	60167	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ I recollect when your poor papa and I came to town after we were married , that a young lady brought me home a chip cottage - bonnet , with white and green trimming , and green persian lining , in her own carriage , which drove up to the door full gallop;--at least , I am not quite certain whether it was her own carriage or a hackney chariot , but I remember very well that the horse dropped down dead as he was turning round , and that your poor papa said he had n’t had any corn for a fortnight . ’
60319	60325	60327	60327	Ralph	208	‘ The lady ’s name , ’
60333	60368	60327	60327	Ralph	208	‘ is Mantalini -- Madame Mantalini . I know her . She lives near Cavendish Square . If your daughter is disposed to try after the situation , I ’ll take her there directly . ’
60369	60382	60384	60385	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ Have you nothing to say to your uncle , my love ? ’
60387	60392	60394	60394	Kate	210	‘ A great deal , ’
60396	60434	60394	60394	Kate	210	‘ but not now . I would rather speak to him when we are alone;--it will save his time if I thank him and say what I wish to say to him , as we walk along . ’
60595	60598	60599	60599	he	208	‘ Now , ’
60606	60634	60599	60599	he	208	‘ walk as fast as you can , and you ’ll get into the step that you ’ll have to walk to business with , every morning . ’
60653	60664	60666	60668	the young lady	893	‘ I am very much obliged to you , uncle , ’
60681	60684	60666	60668	the young lady	893	‘ very . ’
60685	60687	60666	60668	the young lady	893	‘ I ’m
60693	60697	60666	60668	the young lady	893	’ said Ralph . ‘
60706	60707	60708	60708	I	0	’ ‘
60716	60720	60708	60708	I	0	’ replied Kate : ‘
60723	60724	60722	60722	I--	0	’ ‘
60731	60735	60736	60736	I	0	’ growled Ralph ; ‘
60740	60741	60736	60736	I	0	’ ‘
60752	60757	60750	60750	uncle	8733	’ began poor Kate . ‘
60761	60769	60750	60750	uncle	8733	’ replied Ralph , stopping her short , ‘
60783	61122	61123	61123	Uncle	8733	’ Perhaps this was not the best way to dry the tears of a young and sensitive female , about to make her first entry on an entirely new scene of life , among cold and uninterested strangers ; but it had its effect notwithstanding . Kate coloured deeply , breathed quickly for a few moments , and then walked on with a firmer and more determined step . It was a curious contrast to see how the timid country girl shrunk through the crowd that hurried up and down the streets , giving way to the press of people , and clinging closely to Ralph as though she feared to lose him in the throng ; and how the stern and hard - featured man of business went doggedly on , elbowing the passengers aside , and now and then exchanging a gruff salutation with some passing acquaintance , who turned to look back upon his pretty charge , with looks expressive of surprise , and seemed to wonder at the ill - assorted companionship . But , it would have been a stranger contrast still , to have read the hearts that were beating side by side ; to have laid bare the gentle innocence of the one , and the rugged villainy of the other ; to have hung upon the guileless thoughts of the affectionate girl , and been amazed that , among all the wily plots and calculations of the old man , there should not be one word or figure denoting thought of death or of the grave . But so it was ; and stranger still -- though this is a thing of every day -- the warm young heart palpitated with a thousand anxieties and apprehensions , while that of the old worldly man lay rusting in its cell , beating only as a piece of cunning mechanism , and yielding no one throb of hope , or fear , or love , or care , for any living thing . ‘
61125	61139	61123	61123	Uncle	8733	’ said Kate , when she judged they must be near their destination , ‘
61155	61156	61148	61148	I	0	’ ‘
61160	61164	61171	61171	I	0	’ replied Ralph ; ‘
61169	61170	61171	61171	I	0	’ ‘
61180	61185	61177	61178	THE WIDOW	8501	’ said Kate emphatically . ‘
61198	61202	61177	61178	THE WIDOW	8501	’ rejoined Ralph ; ‘
61227	61228	61213	61213	you	0	’ ‘
61236	61240	61233	61233	I	0	’ said Kate ; ‘
61279	61280	61308	61310	a humble one	1960	’ ‘
61284	61299	61303	61303	you	8733	’ said Ralph , walking faster , in the impatience provoked by the remark ; ‘
61317	61318	61326	61326	I	0	’ ‘
61333	61337	61326	61326	I	0	’ urged Kate . ‘
61342	61346	61338	61338	I	0	’ said Ralph . ‘
61359	61360	61353	61353	you	8733	’ ‘
61370	61374	61363	61363	I	0	’ said Ralph ; ‘
61418	61730	61404	61404	you	8733	’ There was comfort in this . Kate poured forth many thanks for her uncle ’s consideration , which Ralph received as if he had deserved them all , and they arrived without any further conversation at the dressmaker ’s door , which displayed a very large plate , with Madame Mantalini ’s name and occupation , and was approached by a handsome flight of steps . There was a shop to the house , but it was let off to an importer of otto of roses . Madame Mantalini ’s shows - rooms were on the first - floor : a fact which was notified to the nobility and gentry by the casual exhibition , near the handsomely curtained windows , of two or three elegant bonnets of the newest fashion , and some costly garments in the most approved taste . A liveried footman opened the door , and in reply to Ralph ’s inquiry whether Madame Mantalini was at home , ushered them , through a handsome hall and up a spacious staircase , into the show saloon , which comprised two spacious drawing - rooms , and exhibited an immense variety of superb dresses and materials for dresses : some arranged on stands , others laid carelessly on sofas , and others again , scattered over the carpet , hanging on the cheval - glasses , or mingling , in some other way , with the rich furniture of various descriptions , which was profusely displayed . They waited here a much longer time than was agreeable to Mr. Ralph Nickleby , who eyed the gaudy frippery about him with very little concern , and was at length about to pull the bell , when a gentleman suddenly popped his head into the room , and , seeing somebody there , as suddenly popped it out again . ‘
61735	61739	61404	61404	you	8733	’ cried Ralph . ‘
61744	61779	61780	61780	Demmit	291	’ At the sound of Ralph ’s voice , the head reappeared , and the mouth , displaying a very long row of very white teeth , uttered in a mincing tone the words , ‘
61790	61869	61870	61870	Demmit	291	’ Having uttered which ejaculations , the gentleman advanced , and shook hands with Ralph , with great warmth . He was dressed in a gorgeous morning gown , with a waistcoat and Turkish trousers of the same pattern , a pink silk neckerchief , and bright green slippers , and had a very copious watch - chain wound round his body . Moreover , he had whiskers and a moustache , both dyed black and gracefully curled . ‘
61887	61898	61883	61883	you	291	’ said this gentleman , smiting Ralph on the shoulder . ‘
61902	61908	61885	61885	demmit	1965	’ said Ralph , sarcastically . ‘
61915	61940	61941	61942	My niece	8979	’ cried the gentleman ; when , wheeling round to laugh with greater elegance , he encountered Kate Nickleby , who was standing near . ‘
61944	61948	61941	61942	My niece	8979	’ said Ralph . ‘
61952	61973	61974	61974	Demmit	291	’ said the gentleman , striking his nose with the knuckle of his forefinger as a chastening for his forgetfulness . ‘
62015	62084	62001	62001	They	1968	’ Giving loose to the playfulness of his imagination , after this fashion , the gentleman led the way to a private sitting - room on the second floor , scarcely less elegantly furnished than the apartment below , where the presence of a silver coffee - pot , an egg - shell , and sloppy china for one , seemed to show that he had just breakfasted . ‘
62091	62113	62001	62001	They	1968	’ said the gentleman : first staring Miss Nickleby out of countenance , and then grinning in delight at the achievement . ‘
62137	62138	62135	62135	Nickleby	226	’ ‘
62146	62154	62139	62139	I	0	’ replied Ralph , looking bitterly round . ‘
62165	62170	62163	62163	Nickleby	226	’ said the gentleman , ‘
62192	62411	62171	62186	the demdest , longest - headed , queerest - tempered old coiner of gold and silver	1974	’ Having complimented Ralph to this effect , the gentleman rang the bell , and stared at Miss Nickleby until it was answered , when he left off to bid the man desire his mistress to come directly ; after which , he began again , and left off no more until Madame Mantalini appeared . The dressmaker was a buxom person , handsomely dressed and rather good - looking , but much older than the gentleman in the Turkish trousers , whom she had wedded some six months before . His name was originally Muntle ; but it had been converted , by an easy transition , into Mantalini : the lady rightly considering that an English appellation would be of serious injury to the business . He had married on his whiskers ; upon which property he had previously subsisted , in a genteel manner , for some years ; and which he had recently improved , after patient cultivation by the addition of a moustache , which promised to secure him an easy independence : his share in the labours of the business being at present confined to spending the money , and occasionally , when that ran short , driving to Mr. Ralph Nickleby to procure discount -- at a percentage -- for the customers ’
62414	62418	62420	62421	Mr. Mantalini	289	‘ My life , ’
62423	62435	62420	62421	Mr. Mantalini	289	‘ what a demd devil of a time you have been ! ’
62436	62450	62452	62453	Madame Mantalini	290	‘ I did n’t even know Mr. Nickleby was here , my love , ’
62455	62471	62473	62474	Mr. Mantalini	289	‘ Then what a doubly demd infernal rascal that footman must be , my soul , ’
62476	62480	62482	62482	Madame	290	‘ My dear , ’
62484	62491	62482	62482	Madame	290	‘ that is entirely your fault . ’
62492	62501	62420	62421	Mr. Mantalini	289	‘ My fault , my heart ’s joy ? ’
62502	62505	62507	62508	the lady	8485	‘ Certainly , ’
62510	62526	62507	62508	the lady	8485	‘ what can you expect , dearest , if you will not correct the man ? ’
62527	62537	62420	62421	Mr. Mantalini	289	‘ Correct the man , my soul ’s delight ! ’
62538	62552	62554	62554	Madame	290	‘ Yes ; I am sure he wants speaking to , badly enough , ’
62558	62565	62567	62568	Mr. Mantalini	289	‘ Then do not vex itself , ’
62570	62583	62567	62568	Mr. Mantalini	289	‘ he shall be horse - whipped till he cries out demnebly . ’
62617	62622	62624	62624	Ralph	208	‘ Now , ma’am , ’
62646	62652	62624	62624	Ralph	208	‘ this is my niece . ’
62653	62660	62662	62663	Madame Mantalini	290	‘ Just so , Mr. Nickleby , ’
62676	62684	62662	62663	Madame Mantalini	290	‘ Can you speak French , child ? ’
62685	62690	62692	62692	Kate	210	‘ Yes , ma’am , ’
62720	62726	62728	62729	the husband	1979	‘ Like a demd native ? ’
62762	62774	62776	62776	Madame	290	‘ We keep twenty young women constantly employed in the establishment , ’
62778	62783	62785	62785	Kate	210	‘ Indeed , ma’am ! ’
62789	62795	62785	62785	Kate	210	‘ Yes ; and some of ‘
62802	62807	62808	62808	Mantalini	289	’ said the master . ‘
62810	62820	62808	62808	Mantalini	289	’ exclaimed his wife , in an awful voice . ‘
62823	62826	62828	62828	Mantalini	289	’ idol ! ’
62830	62839	62828	62828	Mantalini	289	‘ Do you wish to break my heart ? ’
62840	62857	62859	62859	Mantalini	289	‘ Not for twenty thousand hemispheres populated with -- with -- with little ballet - dancers , ’
62865	62879	62881	62882	his wife	648	‘ Then you will , if you persevere in that mode of speaking , ’
62884	62895	62881	62882	his wife	648	‘ What can Mr. Nickleby think when he hears you ? ’
62896	62905	62907	62907	Ralph	208	‘ Oh ! Nothing , ma’am , nothing , ’
62909	62930	62907	62907	Ralph	208	‘ I know his amiable nature , and yours,--mere little remarks that give a zest to your daily intercourse -- lovers ’
62954	63031	63033	63036	a demd horrid croaking	1983	’ If an iron door could be supposed to quarrel with its hinges , and to make a firm resolution to open with slow obstinacy , and grind them to powder in the process , it would emit a pleasanter sound in so doing , than did these words in the rough and bitter voice in which they were uttered by Ralph . Even Mr. Mantalini felt their influence , and turning affrighted round , exclaimed : ‘
63038	63039	63033	63036	a demd horrid croaking	1983	’ ‘
63056	63065	63052	63053	Mr. Mantalini	289	’ observed his wife , addressing Miss Nickleby . ‘
63072	63080	63070	63070	ma’am	8678	’ said Kate , with quiet contempt . ‘
63093	63107	63081	63082	Mr. Mantalini	289	’ continued Madame , looking at her husband , and speaking to Kate . ‘
63163	63164	63165	63165	I	0	’ ‘
63178	63187	63165	63165	I	0	’ replied Kate , in a low voice . ‘
63199	63216	63191	63191	she	1991	’ said Ralph , putting in a word , lest this confession should injure the negotiation . ‘
63221	63226	63217	63217	I	0	’ returned Madame Mantalini ; ‘
63240	63254	63255	63255	Kate	210	’re very full of business , for which I allow payment as overtime . ’
63270	63274	63276	63277	Madame Mantalini	290	‘ Your meals , ’
63279	63328	63276	63277	Madame Mantalini	290	‘ that is , dinner and tea , you will take here . I should think your wages would average from five to seven shillings a week ; but I ca n’t give you any certain information on that point , until I see what you can do . ’
63335	63338	63331	63331	her	210	‘ If you ’re
63343	63348	63331	63331	her	210	’ said Madame Mantalini , ‘
63387	63388	63384	63385	Mr. Nickleby	208	’ ‘
63394	63400	63384	63385	Mr. Nickleby	208	’ replied Ralph , rising . ‘
63408	63516	63402	63402	I	0	’ said the lady . Having arrived at this natural conclusion , she looked at the door , as if she wished to be gone , but hesitated notwithstanding , as though unwilling to leave to Mr Mantalini the sole honour of showing them downstairs . Ralph relieved her from her perplexity by taking his departure without delay : Madame Mantalini making many gracious inquiries why he never came to see them ; and Mr. Mantalini anathematising the stairs with great volubility as he followed them down , in the hope of inducing Kate to look round,--a hope , however , which was destined to remain ungratified . ‘
63519	63529	63531	63531	you	1995	’ said Ralph when they got into the street ; ‘
63532	63536	63537	63537	Kate	210	’re provided for . ’
63550	63556	63557	63557	he	1996	‘ I had some idea , ’
63560	63614	63557	63557	he	1996	‘ of providing for your mother in a pleasant part of the country--(he had a presentation to some almshouses on the borders of Cornwall , which had occurred to him more than once)--but as you want to be together , I must do something else for her . She has a little money ? ’
63615	63620	63622	63622	Kate	210	‘ A very little , ’
63624	63638	63640	63640	Ralph	208	‘ A little will go a long way if it ’s used sparingly , ’
63642	63665	63640	63640	Ralph	208	‘ She must see how long she can make it last , living rent free . You leave your lodgings on Saturday ? ’
63666	63676	63557	63557	he	1996	‘ You told us to do so , uncle . ’
63677	63721	63557	63557	he	1996	‘ Yes ; there is a house empty that belongs to me , which I can put you into till it is let , and then , if nothing else turns up , perhaps I shall have another . You must live there . ’
63722	63731	63733	63733	Kate	210	‘ Is it far from here , sir ? ’
63735	63739	63741	63741	Ralph	208	‘ Pretty well , ’
63743	63787	63741	63741	Ralph	208	‘ in another quarter of the town -- at the East end ; but I ’ll send my clerk down to you , at five o’clock on Saturday , to take you there . Goodbye . You know your way ? Straight on . ’
64190	64200	64202	64204	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ I am afraid it is an unhealthy occupation , ’
64206	64237	64202	64204	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ I recollect getting three young milliners to sit to me , when I first began to paint , and I remember that they were all very pale and sickly . ’
64238	64251	64253	64254	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ Oh ! that ’s not a general rule by any means , ’
64256	64309	64253	64254	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ for I remember , as well as if it was only yesterday , employing one that I was particularly recommended to , to make me a scarlet cloak at the time when scarlet cloaks were fashionable , and she had a very red face -- a very red face , indeed . ’
64310	64315	64317	64319	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ Perhaps she drank , ’
64321	64332	64317	64319	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ I do n’t know how that may have been , ’
64337	64355	64334	64335	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ but I know she had a very red face , so your argument goes for nothing . ’
64497	64513	64515	64515	Kate	210	‘ I shall be sorry -- truly sorry to leave you , my kind friend , ’
64533	64545	64547	64549	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ You shall not shake me off , for all that , ’
64560	64619	64547	64549	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ I shall see you very often , and come and hear how you get on ; and if , in all London , or all the wide world besides , there is no other heart that takes an interest in your welfare , there will be one little lonely woman that prays for it night and day . ’
64688	64694	64686	64686	she	2023	‘ a real good cry . ’
64777	64783	64785	64785	Newman	211	‘ From Mr. Ralph Nickleby , ’
64801	64808	64810	64810	Kate	210	‘ We shall be ready directly , ’
64812	64829	64810	64810	Kate	210	‘ We have not much to carry , but I fear we must have a coach . ’
64830	64836	64838	64838	Newman	211	‘ I ’ll get one , ’
64840	64848	64850	64851	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ Indeed you shall not trouble yourself , ’
64853	64857	64859	64859	Newman	211	‘ I will , ’
64861	64874	64876	64877	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ I ca n’t suffer you to think of such a thing , ’
64879	64886	64888	64888	Newman	211	‘ You ca n’t help it , ’
64890	64895	64888	64888	Newman	211	‘ Not help it ! ’
64896	64934	64948	64949	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ No ; I thought of it as I came along ; but did n’t get one , thinking you might n’t be ready . I think of a great many things . Nobody can prevent that . ’
64935	64946	64948	64949	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ Oh yes , I understand you , Mr. Noggs , ’
64951	64969	64948	64949	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ Our thoughts are free , of course . Everybody ’s thoughts are their own , clearly . ’
64970	64983	64985	64985	Newman	211	‘ They would n’t be , if some people had their way , ’
64987	65004	64985	64985	Newman	211	‘ Well , no more they would , Mr. Noggs , and that ’s very true , ’
65009	65023	65006	65007	Mrs Nickleby	207	‘ Some people to be sure are such -- how ’s your master ? ’
65058	65070	65072	65073	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ I am sure we are very much obliged to him , ’
65075	65078	65080	65080	Newman	211	‘ Very , ’
65082	65089	65080	65080	Newman	211	‘ I ’ll tell him so . ’
65162	65167	65168	65168	she	210	‘ Excuse my curiosity , ’
65171	65192	65168	65168	she	210	‘ but did I not see you in the coachyard , on the morning my brother went away to Yorkshire ? ’
65203	65206	65193	65193	Newman	211	‘ No , ’
65210	65213	65215	65215	Kate	210	‘ No ! ’
65217	65225	65215	65215	Kate	210	‘ I should have said so anywhere . ’
65226	65233	65235	65235	Newman	211	‘ You ’d have said wrong , ’
65237	65257	65235	65235	Newman	211	‘ It ’s the first time I ’ve been out for three weeks . I ’ve had the gout . ’
65668	65676	65678	65678	Kate	210	‘ This house depresses and chills one , ’
65680	65733	65678	65678	Kate	210	‘ and seems as if some blight had fallen on it . If I were superstitious , I should be almost inclined to believe that some dreadful crime had been perpetrated within these old walls , and that the place had never prospered since . How frowning and how dark it looks ! ’
65734	65740	65742	65743	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ Lord , my dear , ’
65745	65761	65742	65743	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ do n’t talk in that way , or you ’ll frighten me to death . ’
65762	65772	65774	65774	Kate	210	‘ It is only my foolish fancy , mama , ’
65780	65811	65813	65814	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ Well , then , my love , I wish you would keep your foolish fancy to yourself , and not wake up MY foolish fancy to keep it company , ’
65816	65876	65813	65814	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ Why did n’t you think of all this before -- you are so careless -- we might have asked Miss La Creevy to keep us company or borrowed a dog , or a thousand things -- but it always was the way , and was just the same with your poor dear father . Unless I thought of everything-- ’
65999	66005	66007	66008	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ Well , my dear , ’
66015	66056	66007	66008	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ now is n’t this thoughtful and considerate of your uncle ? Why , we should not have had anything but the bed we bought yesterday , to lie down upon , if it had n’t been for his thoughtfulness ! ’
66057	66063	66065	66065	Kate	210	‘ Very kind , indeed , ’
66194	66205	66207	66207	Kate	210	‘ We need detain you no longer , I think , ’
66209	66217	66219	66219	Newman	211	‘ Is there nothing I can do ? ’
66221	66227	66229	66230	Miss Nickleby	226	‘ Nothing , thank you , ’
66232	66247	66249	66250	Mrs Nickleby	207	‘ Perhaps , my dear , Mr. Noggs would like to drink our healths , ’
66261	66267	66269	66269	Kate	210	‘ I think , mama , ’
66279	66290	66274	66274	Newman	211	‘ you would hurt his feelings if you offered it . ’
66466	66470	66460	66460	he	2064	‘ too far gone ’
66684	66695	66697	66698	the handmaiden	2073	‘ How lovely your hair do curl tonight , miss ! ’
66700	66717	66697	66698	the handmaiden	2073	‘ I declare if it is n’t a pity and a shame to brush it out ! ’
66718	66723	66725	66726	Miss Squeers	282	‘ Hold your tongue ! ’
66786	66806	66808	66809	the attendant	2075	‘ Well , I could n’t help saying , miss , if you was to kill me for it , ’
66811	66826	66808	66809	the attendant	2075	‘ that I never see nobody look so vulgar as Miss Price this night . ’
66837	66852	66854	66855	the girl	826	‘ I know it ’s very wrong in me to say so , miss , ’
66866	66909	66854	66855	the girl	826	‘ Miss Price being a friend of your’n , and all ; but she do dress herself out so , and go on in such a manner to get noticed , that -- oh -- well , if people only saw themselves ! ’
66910	66918	66920	66921	Miss Squeers	282	‘ What do you mean , Phib ? ’
66955	66960	66937	66937	she	282	‘ How you talk ! ’
66961	66987	66989	66990	the handmaid	880	‘ Talk , miss ! It ’s enough to make a Tom cat talk French grammar , only to see how she tosses her head , ’
66992	66999	67001	67002	Miss Squeers	282	‘ She DOES toss her head , ’
67010	67021	67023	67024	the girl	826	‘ So vain , and so very -- very plain , ’
67026	67028	67023	67024	the girl	826	‘ Poor ‘
67031	67038	67042	67042	herself	2080	’ sighed Miss Squeers , compassionately . ‘
67052	67057	67023	67024	the girl	826	’ pursued the servant . ‘
67067	67068	67069	67069	I	0	’ ‘
67082	67087	67080	67080	Phib	297	’ said Miss Squeers . ‘
67088	67114	67069	67069	I	0	’ Tilda ’s friends are low people , and if she do n’t know any better , it ’s their fault , and not hers . ’
67115	67124	67126	67126	Phoebe	298	‘ Well , but you know , miss , ’
67131	67133	67069	67069	I	0	‘ Phib ’
67141	67184	67126	67126	Phoebe	298	‘ if she was only to take copy by a friend -- oh ! if she only knew how wrong she was , and would but set herself right by you , what a nice young woman she might be in time ! ’
67185	67188	67190	67191	Miss Squeers	282	‘ Phib , ’
67198	67213	67190	67191	Miss Squeers	282	‘ it ’s not proper for me to hear these comparisons drawn ; they make ‘
67255	67267	67249	67249	I	0	‘ Tilda Price would take pattern by somebody -- not me particularly-- ’
67268	67276	67278	67278	Phib	297	‘ Oh yes ; you , miss , ’
67280	67294	67296	67297	Miss Squeers	282	‘ Well , me , Phib , if you will have it so , ’
67299	67318	67296	67297	Miss Squeers	282	‘ I must say , that if she would , she would be all the better for it . ’
67319	67331	67333	67334	the girl	826	‘ So somebody else thinks , or I am much mistaken , ’
67337	67343	67345	67346	Miss Squeers	282	‘ What do you mean ? ’
67348	67354	67356	67357	the girl	826	‘ Never mind , miss , ’
67359	67370	67356	67357	the girl	826	‘ I know what I know ; that ’s all . ’
67371	67374	67376	67377	Miss Squeers	282	‘ Phib , ’
67380	67396	67376	67377	Miss Squeers	282	‘ I insist upon your explaining yourself . What is this dark mystery ? Speak . ’
67397	67412	67414	67416	the servant girl	2030	‘ Why , if you will have it , miss , it ’s this , ’
67418	67458	67414	67416	the servant girl	2030	‘ Mr John Browdie thinks as you think ; and if he was n’t too far gone to do it creditable , he ’d be very glad to be off with Miss Price , and on with Miss Squeers . ’
67459	67463	67465	67466	Miss Squeers	282	‘ Gracious heavens ! ’
67475	67480	67414	67416	the servant girl	2030	‘ What is this ? ’
67481	67491	67493	67495	the artful Phib	297	‘ Truth , ma’am , and nothing but truth , ’
67497	67502	67504	67505	Miss Squeers	282	‘ What a situation ! ’
67507	67521	67504	67505	Miss Squeers	282	‘ on the brink of unconsciously destroying the peace and happiness of my own ‘
67552	67553	67555	67555	they	8646	’ ‘
67563	67568	67555	67555	they	8646	’ replied the girl ; ‘
67574	67589	67607	67607	you	2089	’ ( If Miss Squeers were the reason , it was very plain . ) ‘
67598	67603	67607	67607	you	2089	’ retorted Miss Squeers . ‘
67610	67685	67607	67607	you	2089	‘ Tilda Price has faults -- many faults -- but I wish her well , and above all I wish her married ; for I think it highly desirable -- most desirable from the very nature of her failings -- that she should be married as soon as possible . No , Phib . Let her have Mr. Browdie . I may pity HIM , poor fellow ; but I have a great regard for ‘
67703	67950	67700	67700	she	284	’ With this effusion of feeling , Miss Squeers went to bed . Spite is a little word ; but it represents as strange a jumble of feelings , and compound of discords , as any polysyllable in the language . Miss Squeers knew as well in her heart of hearts that what the miserable serving - girl had said was sheer , coarse , lying flattery , as did the girl herself ; yet the mere opportunity of venting a little ill - nature against the offending Miss Price , and affecting to compassionate her weaknesses and foibles , though only in the presence of a solitary dependant , was almost as great a relief to her spleen as if the whole had been gospel truth . Nay , more . We have such extraordinary powers of persuasion when they are exerted over ourselves , that Miss Squeers felt quite high - minded and great after her noble renunciation of John Browdie ’s hand , and looked down upon her rival with a kind of holy calmness and tranquillity , that had a mighty effect in soothing her ruffled feelings . This happy state of mind had some influence in bringing about a reconciliation ; for , when a knock came at the front - door next day , and the miller ’s daughter was announced , Miss Squeers betook herself to the parlour in a Christian frame of spirit , perfectly beautiful to behold . ‘
67955	67962	67963	67963	you	282	’ said the miller ’s daughter , ‘
67980	67981	67982	67982	I	0	’ ‘
67988	67991	67993	67994	Miss Squeers	282	‘ Tilda , ’
67996	68008	67993	67994	Miss Squeers	282	‘ but I bear no malice . I am above it . ’
68009	68017	68019	68020	Miss Price	285	‘ Do n’t be cross , Fanny , ’
68022	68037	68019	68020	Miss Price	285	‘ I have come to tell you something that I know will please you . ’
68038	68044	67993	67994	Miss Squeers	282	‘ What may that be , ‘
68047	68081	68045	68045	Tilda	284	’ demanded Miss Squeers ; screwing up her lips , and looking as if nothing in earth , air , fire , or water , could afford her the slightest gleam of satisfaction . ‘
68084	68089	68045	68045	Tilda	284	’ rejoined Miss Price . ‘
68104	68105	68098	68098	I	0	’ ‘
68112	68123	68045	68045	Tilda	284	’ said Miss Squeers -- relaxing into a smile though . ‘
68140	68145	68126	68126	I	0	’ rejoined her companion . ‘
68151	68152	68045	68045	Tilda	284	’ ‘
68155	68164	68045	68045	Tilda	284	’ said Miss Squeers , relapsing into melancholy . ‘
68168	68169	68045	68045	Tilda	284	’ ‘
68188	68193	68045	68045	Tilda	284	’ continued Miss Price , ‘
68242	68309	68310	68310	Tilda	284	’ There was mingled gall and honey in this intelligence . The prospect of the friend ’s being married so soon was the gall , and the certainty of her not entertaining serious designs upon Nicholas was the honey . Upon the whole , the sweet greatly preponderated over the bitter , so Miss Squeers said she would get the frock made , and that she hoped ‘
68384	68391	68393	68394	Miss Price	285	‘ But come now , Fanny , ’
68396	68412	68393	68394	Miss Price	285	‘ I want to have a word or two with you about young Mr. Nickleby . ’
68413	68420	68422	68423	Miss Squeers	282	‘ He is nothing to me , ’
68429	68436	68422	68423	Miss Squeers	282	‘ I despise him too much ! ’
68437	68450	68452	68453	her friend	9695	‘ Oh , you do n’t mean that , I am sure ? ’
68455	68467	68452	68453	her friend	9695	‘ Confess , Fanny ; do n’t you like him now ? ’
68502	68507	68509	68510	Miss Squeers	282	‘ I hate everybody , ’
68512	68525	68509	68510	Miss Squeers	282	‘ and I wish that everybody was dead -- that I do . ’
68526	68531	68533	68534	Miss Price	285	‘ Dear , dear , ’
68545	68555	68533	68534	Miss Price	285	‘ You are not serious , I am sure . ’
68556	68562	68564	68565	Miss Squeers	282	‘ Yes , I am , ’
68580	68591	68564	68565	Miss Squeers	282	‘ And I wish I was dead too . There ! ’
68592	68605	68607	68607	Matilda	285	‘ Oh ! you ’ll think very differently in another five minutes , ’
68609	68665	68607	68607	Matilda	285	‘ How much better to take him into favour again , than to hurt yourself by going on in that way . Would n’t it be much nicer , now , to have him all to yourself on good terms , in a company - keeping , love - making , pleasant sort of manner ? ’
68666	68676	68678	68679	Miss Squeers	282	‘ I do n’t know but what it would , ’
68681	68684	68678	68679	Miss Squeers	282	‘ Oh ! ‘
68712	68713	68707	68707	anybody	8517	’ ‘
68716	68723	68707	68707	anybody	8517	’ exclaimed Miss Price , giggling . ‘
68735	68736	68731	68731	somebody	8568	’ ‘
68742	68748	68731	68731	somebody	8568	’ said Miss Squeers passionately . ‘
68768	68773	68774	68774	Persons	9612	’ cried Miss Price . ‘
68809	68810	68812	68812	your	284	’ ‘
68815	68825	68827	68827	you	284	’ shrieked Miss Squeers , in her shrillest tone ; ‘
68834	68846	68827	68827	you	284	‘ Tilda , and afterwards I should be sorry for it ! ’
69340	69349	69325	69325	she	282	‘ felt fit to drop into the earth . ’
69350	69362	69364	69365	Miss Price	285	‘ Shall we turn back , or run into a cottage ? ’

69382	69387	69380	69380	Tilda	284	’ replied Miss Squeers , ‘
69402	69497	69325	69325	she	282	’ As Miss Squeers said this , in the tone of one who has made a high moral resolution , and was , besides , taken with one or two chokes and catchings of breath , indicative of feelings at a high pressure , her friend made no further remark , and they bore straight down upon Nicholas , who , walking with his eyes bent upon the ground , was not aware of their approach until they were close upon him ; otherwise , he might , perhaps , have taken shelter himself . ‘
69502	69511	69512	69512	He	2125	’ said Nicholas , bowing and passing by . ‘

69566	69573	69562	69562	Nicholas	207	‘ come back , Mr. Nickleby ! ’
69599	69606	69608	69609	Miss Price	285	‘ Do n’t stop to talk , ’
69613	69630	69608	69609	Miss Price	285	‘ but support her on the other side . How do you feel now , dear ? ’
69631	69634	69636	69637	Miss Squeers	282	‘ Better , ’
69659	69664	69686	69686	she	285	‘ This foolish faintness ! ’
69665	69674	69676	69677	Miss Price	285	‘ Do n’t call it foolish , dear , ’
69693	69729	69686	69686	she	285	‘ you have no reason to be ashamed of it . It ’s those who are too proud to come round again , without all this to - do , that ought to be ashamed . ’
69730	69743	69745	69745	Nicholas	207	‘ You are resolved to fix it upon me , I see , ’
69749	69764	69745	69745	Nicholas	207	‘ although I told you , last night , it was not my fault . ’
69765	69779	69781	69784	the wicked Miss Price	285	‘ There ; he says it was not his fault , my dear , ’
69786	69817	69781	69784	the wicked Miss Price	285	‘ Perhaps you were too jealous , or too hasty with him ? He says it was not his fault . You hear ; I think that ’s apology enough . ’
69818	69825	69827	69827	Nicholas	207	‘ You will not understand me , ’
69829	69858	69827	69827	Nicholas	207	‘ Pray dispense with this jesting , for I have no time , and really no inclination , to be the subject or promoter of mirth just now . ’
69859	69865	69867	69868	Miss Price	285	‘ What do you mean ? ’
69873	69879	69867	69868	Miss Price	285	‘ Do n’t ask him , ‘

69934	69980	69925	69925	you	285	’ Here he raised up the brown bonnet , and regarding with most unfeigned astonishment a look of tender reproach from Miss Squeers , shrunk back a few paces to be out of the reach of the fair burden , and went on to say : ‘
70039	70040	70030	70030	I	0	’ ‘
70054	70062	70047	70047	you	0	’ exclaimed Miss Price as Nicholas paused . ‘
70070	70085	70063	70063	I	0	’ stammered Nicholas with a half - smile , and looking towards Miss Squeers , ‘
70139	70140	70129	70129	she	1897	’ ‘
70144	70149	70129	70129	she	1897	’ thought Miss Squeers , ‘
70166	70173	70164	70164	dear	9456	’ she whispered to her friend . ‘
70179	70184	70187	70187	she	1897	’ rejoined Miss Price ; ‘
70190	70191	70187	70187	she	1897	’ ‘
70195	70216	70192	70192	She	1897	’ exclaimed Nicholas with such energy of utterance as might have been , for the moment , mistaken for rapture . ‘
70219	70223	70192	70192	She	1897	’ replied Miss Price ‘
70231	70234	70236	70239	the blushing Miss Squeers	282	‘ Tilda , ’
70244	70257	70236	70239	the blushing Miss Squeers	282	‘ he may set his mind at rest . His sentiments are recipro-- ’
70258	70261	70263	70263	Nicholas	207	‘ Stop , ’
70266	70435	70263	70263	Nicholas	207	‘ pray hear me . This is the grossest and wildest delusion , the completest and most signal mistake , that ever human being laboured under , or committed . I have scarcely seen the young lady half - a - dozen times , but if I had seen her sixty times , or am destined to see her sixty thousand , it would be , and will be , precisely the same . I have not one thought , wish , or hope , connected with her , unless it be -- and I say this , not to hurt her feelings , but to impress her with the real state of my own -- unless it be the one object , dear to my heart as life itself , of being one day able to turn my back upon this accursed place , never to set foot in it again , or think of it -- even think of it -- but with loathing and disgust . ’
70531	70533	70964	70964	him	2136	‘ found ’
70572	70962	70964	70964	him	2136	’ time , to a man who had gone down on his very knees to ask her . She could have choked in right good earnest , at the thought of being so humbled . But , there was one thing clear in the midst of her mortification ; and that was , that she hated and detested Nicholas with all the narrowness of mind and littleness of purpose worthy a descendant of the house of Squeers . And there was one comfort too ; and that was , that every hour in every day she could wound his pride , and goad him with the infliction of some slight , or insult , or deprivation , which could not but have some effect on the most insensible person , and must be acutely felt by one so sensitive as Nicholas . With these two reflections uppermost in her mind , Miss Squeers made the best of the matter to her friend , by observing that Mr. Nickleby was such an odd creature , and of such a violent temper , that she feared she should be obliged to give him up ; and parted from her . And here it may be remarked , that Miss Squeers , having bestowed her affections ( or whatever it might be that , in the absence of anything better , represented them ) on Nicholas Nickleby , had never once seriously contemplated the possibility of his being of a different opinion from herself in the business . Miss Squeers reasoned that she was prepossessing and beautiful , and that her father was master , and Nicholas man , and that her father had saved money , and Nicholas had none , all of which seemed to her conclusive arguments why the young man should feel only too much honoured by her preference . She had not failed to recollect , either , how much more agreeable she could render his situation if she were his friend , and how much more disagreeable if she were his enemy ; and , doubtless , many less scrupulous young gentlemen than Nicholas would have encouraged her extravagance had it been only for this very obvious and intelligible reason . However , he had thought proper to do otherwise , and Miss Squeers was outrageous . ‘
70967	70993	70964	70964	him	2136	’ said the irritated young lady , when she had regained her own room , and eased her mind by committing an assault on Phib , ‘
71010	71587	71588	71588	I	0	’ It was scarcely necessary to do this , but Miss Squeers was as good as her word ; and poor Nicholas , in addition to bad food , dirty lodging , and the being compelled to witness one dull unvarying round of squalid misery , was treated with every special indignity that malice could suggest , or the most grasping cupidity put upon him . Nor was this all . There was another and deeper system of annoyance which made his heart sink , and nearly drove him wild , by its injustice and cruelty . The wretched creature , Smike , since the night Nicholas had spoken kindly to him in the schoolroom , had followed him to and fro , with an ever - restless desire to serve or help him ; anticipating such little wants as his humble ability could supply , and content only to be near him . He would sit beside him for hours , looking patiently into his face ; and a word would brighten up his care - worn visage , and call into it a passing gleam , even of happiness . He was an altered being ; he had an object now ; and that object was , to show his attachment to the only person -- that person a stranger -- who had treated him , not to say with kindness , but like a human creature . Upon this poor being , all the spleen and ill - humour that could not be vented on Nicholas were unceasingly bestowed . Drudgery would have been nothing -- Smike was well used to that . Buffetings inflicted without cause , would have been equally a matter of course ; for to them also he had served a long and weary apprenticeship ; but it was no sooner observed that he had become attached to Nicholas , than stripes and blows , stripes and blows , morning , noon , and night , were his only portion . Squeers was jealous of the influence which his man had so soon acquired , and his family hated him , and Smike paid for both . Nicholas saw it , and ground his teeth at every repetition of the savage and cowardly attack . He had arranged a few regular lessons for the boys ; and one night , as he paced up and down the dismal schoolroom , his swollen heart almost bursting to think that his protection and countenance should have increased the misery of the wretched being whose peculiar destitution had awakened his pity , he paused mechanically in a dark corner where sat the object of his thoughts . The poor soul was poring hard over a tattered book , with the traces of recent tears still upon his face ; vainly endeavouring to master some task which a child of nine years old , possessed of ordinary powers , could have conquered with ease , but which , to the addled brain of the crushed boy of nineteen , was a sealed and hopeless mystery . Yet there he sat , patiently conning the page again and again , stimulated by no boyish ambition , for he was the common jest and scoff even of the uncouth objects that congregated about him , but inspired by the one eager desire to please his solitary friend . Nicholas laid his hand upon his shoulder . ‘
71594	71609	71588	71588	I	0	’ said the dejected creature , looking up with bitter disappointment in every feature . ‘
71614	71615	71588	71588	I	0	’ ‘
71620	71654	71588	71588	I	0	’ replied Nicholas . The boy shook his head , and closing the book with a sigh , looked vacantly round , and laid his head upon his arm . He was weeping . ‘
71662	71671	71658	71658	God	225	’ said Nicholas , in an agitated voice ; ‘
71680	71681	71672	71672	I	0	’ ‘
71691	71696	71682	71682	They	2138	’ sobbed the boy . ‘
71701	71705	71706	71706	They	2138	’ rejoined Nicholas . ‘

71715	71720	71713	71713	you	0	’ said the outcast , ‘

71767	71778	71779	71779	Softly	299	’ cried the other , looking intently in his face . ‘
71781	71785	71779	71779	Softly	299	’ rejoined Nicholas . ‘
71788	71789	71779	71779	Softly	299	’ ‘
71794	71804	71805	71805	I	0	’ demanded the boy , in an earnest whisper . ‘
71810	71814	71805	71805	I	0	’ replied Nicholas . ‘

71833	71839	71815	71815	I	0	’ said the boy imploringly , ‘

71863	71867	71854	71854	I	0	’ said Nicholas . ‘

71882	71886	71854	71854	I	0	’ urged Smike , ‘

71903	71915	71854	71854	I	0	’ replied Nicholas , pursuing the train of his own thoughts ; ‘

71936	71948	71854	71854	I	0	’ demanded the boy , speaking with unusual wildness and volubility . ‘
71951	71960	71854	71854	I	0	’ replied Nicholas , willing to soothe him . ‘
71965	71976	71978	71978	I	0	’ said the other , clasping him by the hand . ‘
71997	71998	71999	71999	You	0	’ ‘
72002	72012	71999	71999	You	0	’ replied Nicholas , with the same humane intention , ‘
72034	72564	72029	72029	I	0	’ The boy caught both the young man ’s hands passionately in his , and , hugging them to his breast , uttered a few broken sounds which were unintelligible . Squeers entered at the moment , and he shrunk back into his old corner . CHAPTER 13 Nicholas varies the Monotony of Dothebys Hall by a most vigorous and remarkable proceeding , which leads to Consequences of some Importance The cold , feeble dawn of a January morning was stealing in at the windows of the common sleeping - room , when Nicholas , raising himself on his arm , looked among the prostrate forms which on every side surrounded him , as though in search of some particular object . It needed a quick eye to detect , from among the huddled mass of sleepers , the form of any given individual . As they lay closely packed together , covered , for warmth ’s sake , with their patched and ragged clothes , little could be distinguished but the sharp outlines of pale faces , over which the sombre light shed the same dull heavy colour ; with , here and there , a gaunt arm thrust forth : its thinness hidden by no covering , but fully exposed to view , in all its shrunken ugliness . There were some who , lying on their backs with upturned faces and clenched hands , just visible in the leaden light , bore more the aspect of dead bodies than of living creatures ; and there were others coiled up into strange and fantastic postures , such as might have been taken for the uneasy efforts of pain to gain some temporary relief , rather than the freaks of slumber . A few -- and these were among the youngest of the children -- slept peacefully on , with smiles upon their faces , dreaming perhaps of home ; but ever and again a deep and heavy sigh , breaking the stillness of the room , announced that some new sleeper had awakened to the misery of another day ; and , as morning took the place of night , the smiles gradually faded away , with the friendly darkness which had given them birth . Dreams are the bright creatures of poem and legend , who sport on earth in the night season , and melt away in the first beam of the sun , which lights grim care and stern reality on their daily pilgrimage through the world . Nicholas looked upon the sleepers ; at first , with the air of one who gazes upon a scene which , though familiar to him , has lost none of its sorrowful effect in consequence ; and , afterwards , with a more intense and searching scrutiny , as a man would who missed something his eye was accustomed to meet , and had expected to rest upon . He was still occupied in this search , and had half risen from his bed in the eagerness of his quest , when the voice of Squeers was heard , calling from the bottom of the stairs . ‘
72568	72573	72029	72029	I	0	’ cried that gentleman , ‘
72584	72585	72586	72586	You	2144	’ ‘
72590	72622	72586	72586	You	2144	’ added Mrs. Squeers , finishing the sentence , and producing , at the same time , a sharp sound , like that which is occasioned by the lacing of stays . ‘
72631	72635	72623	72623	We	2145	’ replied Nicholas . ‘
72639	72643	72623	72623	We	2145	’ said Squeers . ‘
72670	72682	72683	72683	Smike	264	’ Nicholas looked hurriedly round again , but made no answer . ‘
72685	72689	72683	72683	Smike	264	’ shouted Squeers . ‘
72703	72742	72701	72701	Smike	264	’ demanded his amiable lady in the same key . Still there was no reply , and still Nicholas stared about him , as did the greater part of the boys , who were by this time roused . ‘
72747	72761	72701	72701	Smike	264	’ muttered Squeers , rapping the stair - rail impatiently with his cane . ‘
72764	72765	72762	72762	Nickleby	207	’ ‘
72770	72771	72768	72768	sir	714	’ ‘
72785	72786	72780	72780	you	714	’ ‘
72794	72798	72792	72792	sir	714	’ replied Nicholas . ‘
72806	72811	72812	72812	He	264	’ retorted the schoolmaster . ‘
72815	72816	72812	72812	He	264	’ ‘
72821	72826	72792	72792	sir	714	’ retorted Nicholas angrily , ‘
72833	72834	72835	72835	We	2150	’ ‘
72841	72849	72850	72850	I	0	’ said Mr. Squeers , rushing upstairs . ‘
72859	72914	72857	72857	you	0	’ With which assurance , Mr. Squeers bounced into the dormitory , and , swinging his cane in the air ready for a blow , darted into the corner where the lean body of the drudge was usually stretched at night . The cane descended harmlessly upon the ground . There was nobody there . ‘
72920	72932	72857	72857	you	0	’ said Squeers , turning round with a very pale face . ‘
72939	72940	72935	72935	you	0	’ ‘
72951	72955	72941	72941	I	0	’ replied Nicholas . ‘
72958	72972	72941	72941	I	0	’ said Squeers , evidently frightened , though he endeavoured to look otherwise , ‘
72985	72986	72983	72983	he	264	’ ‘
72999	73018	72983	72983	he	264	’ rejoined Nicholas in a low voice , and fixing his eyes full on the master ’s face . ‘
73029	73089	73092	73092	sir	714	’ retorted Squeers in great perturbation . Without waiting for a reply , he inquired of the boys whether any one among them knew anything of their missing schoolmate . There was a general hum of anxious denial , in the midst of which , one shrill voice was heard to say ( as , indeed , everybody thought ): ‘
73103	73104	73096	73096	Smike	264	’ ‘
73107	73115	73096	73096	Smike	264	’ cried Squeers , turning sharp round . ‘
73120	73121	73122	73122	Tomkins	300	’ ‘
73127	73205	73122	73122	Tomkins	300	’ rejoined a chorus of voices . Mr. Squeers made a plunge into the crowd , and at one dive , caught a very little boy , habited still in his night - gear , and the perplexed expression of whose countenance , as he was brought forward , seemed to intimate that he was as yet uncertain whether he was about to be punished or rewarded for the suggestion . He was not long in doubt . ‘
73218	73222	73214	73214	you	714	’ demanded Squeers . ‘
73228	73234	73214	73214	you	714	’ replied the little boy . ‘
73240	73263	73214	73214	you	714	’ said Squeers , catching the little boy suddenly by the arms and whisking up his drapery in a most dexterous manner , ‘
73286	73345	73284	73284	sir	714	’ The child raised a dismal cry , by way of answer , and Mr. Squeers , throwing himself into the most favourable attitude for exercising his strength , beat him until the little urchin in his writhings actually rolled out of his hands , when he mercifully allowed him to roll away , as he best could . ‘
73348	73352	73284	73284	sir	714	’ said Squeers . ‘
73375	73400	73364	73364	I	0	’ There was , of course , a profound silence , during which Nicholas showed his disgust as plainly as looks could show it . ‘
73405	73413	73403	73403	Nickleby	207	’ said Squeers , eyeing him maliciously . ‘
73424	73425	73421	73421	I	0	’ ‘
73432	73441	73421	73421	I	0	’ replied Nicholas , in a quiet manner . ‘
73450	73454	73448	73448	you	207	’ sneered Squeers . ‘

73470	73471	73472	73472	He	264	’ ‘
73487	73491	73492	73492	He	264	’ sneered Squeers . ‘
73496	73500	73505	73505	he	264	’ replied Nicholas ; ‘
73524	73525	73505	73505	he	264	’ ‘
73538	73546	73547	73547	I	0	’ said Squeers in a taunting fashion . ‘
73551	73555	73556	73556	You	207	’ replied Nicholas . ‘
73564	73605	73556	73556	You	207	’ Mrs. Squeers had listened to this conversation , from the bottom of the stairs ; but , now losing all patience , she hastily assumed her night - jacket , and made her way to the scene of action . ‘
73615	73643	73556	73556	You	207	’ said the lady , as the boys fell off right and left , to save her the trouble of clearing a passage with her brawny arms . ‘

73664	73668	73648	73648	you	207	’ said Squeers , ‘

73869	73890	73859	73859	boys	8645	’ said Mrs. Squeers , mimicking , as nearly as she could , the voice and manner of the usher . ‘

73986	73993	73994	73994	you	8645	’ retorted Mrs. Squeers , contemptuously ; ‘
74020	74079	74080	74080	He	2169	’ With these words , Mrs. Squeers dismissed the boys , and after a little light skirmishing with those in the rear who were pressing forward to get out of the way , but were detained for a few moments by the throng in front , succeeded in clearing the room , when she confronted her spouse alone . ‘
74084	74089	74080	74080	He	2169	’ said Mrs. Squeers . ‘
74134	74135	74138	74138	he	2169	’ ‘
74140	74144	74138	74138	he	2169	’ inquired Squeers . ‘
74147	74153	74138	74138	he	2169	’ said Mrs. Squeers angrily . ‘
74163	74164	74161	74161	he	2169	’ ‘
74182	74186	74170	74170	his	2169	’ replied Squeers . ‘
74191	74196	74170	74170	his	2169	’ rejoined Mrs. Squeers , ‘
74220	74221	74170	74170	his	2169	’ ‘
74228	74232	74170	74170	his	2169	’ laughed Squeers . ‘
74238	74243	74170	74170	his	2169	’ said Mrs. S. , ‘
74264	74265	74170	74170	his	2169	’ ‘
74270	74278	74170	74170	his	2169	’ exclaimed Squeers , clapping his hands . ‘
74303	74308	74297	74297	I	0	’ replied his wife . ‘
74358	74670	74674	74675	the scamp	2180	’ The worthy lady ’s plan was adopted and put in execution without a moment ’s delay . After a very hasty breakfast , and the prosecution of some inquiries in the village , the result of which seemed to show that he was on the right track , Squeers started forth in the pony - chaise , intent upon discovery and vengeance . Shortly afterwards , Mrs. Squeers , arrayed in the white top - coat , and tied up in various shawls and handkerchiefs , issued forth in another chaise and another direction , taking with her a good - sized bludgeon , several odd pieces of strong cord , and a stout labouring man : all provided and carried upon the expedition , with the sole object of assisting in the capture , and ( once caught ) insuring the safe custody of the unfortunate Smike . Nicholas remained behind , in a tumult of feeling , sensible that whatever might be the upshot of the boy ’s flight , nothing but painful and deplorable consequences were likely to ensue from it . Death , from want and exposure to the weather , was the best that could be expected from the protracted wandering of so poor and helpless a creature , alone and unfriended , through a country of which he was wholly ignorant . There was little , perhaps , to choose between this fate and a return to the tender mercies of the Yorkshire school ; but the unhappy being had established a hold upon his sympathy and compassion , which made his heart ache at the prospect of the suffering he was destined to undergo . He lingered on , in restless anxiety , picturing a thousand possibilities , until the evening of next day , when Squeers returned , alone , and unsuccessful . ‘
74677	74703	74704	74704	I	0	’ said the schoolmaster , who had evidently been stretching his legs , on the old principle , not a few times during the journey . ‘
74731	74732	74726	74726	I	0	’ ‘
74745	74749	74737	74737	my	0	’ said Nicholas . ‘

74762	74770	74754	74754	me	0	’ said Squeers in a threatening manner . ‘
74775	74776	74777	74777	We	2183	’ ‘
74780	74784	74777	74777	We	2183	’ rejoined Nicholas . ‘
74815	74819	74828	74828	you	207	’ said Squeers ; ‘
74831	74840	74828	74828	you	207	’ Nicholas shrugged his shoulders and remained silent . ‘
74853	74866	74849	74849	I	0	’ said Squeers , his usual harsh crafty manner changed to open bullying ‘
74896	75197	74849	74849	I	0	’ Nicholas bit his lip and knit his hands involuntarily , for his fingerends tingled to avenge the insult ; but remembering that the man was drunk , and that it could come to little but a noisy brawl , he contented himself with darting a contemptuous look at the tyrant , and walked , as majestically as he could , upstairs : not a little nettled , however , to observe that Miss Squeers and Master Squeers , and the servant girl , were enjoying the scene from a snug corner ; the two former indulging in many edifying remarks about the presumption of poor upstarts , which occasioned a vast deal of laughter , in which even the most miserable of all miserable servant girls joined : while Nicholas , stung to the quick , drew over his head such bedclothes as he had , and sternly resolved that the outstanding account between himself and Mr. Squeers should be settled rather more speedily than the latter anticipated . Another day came , and Nicholas was scarcely awake when he heard the wheels of a chaise approaching the house . It stopped . The voice of Mrs Squeers was heard , and in exultation , ordering a glass of spirits for somebody , which was in itself a sufficient sign that something extraordinary had happened . Nicholas hardly dared to look out of the window ; but he did so , and the very first object that met his eyes was the wretched Smike : so bedabbled with mud and rain , so haggard and worn , and wild , that , but for his garments being such as no scarecrow was ever seen to wear , he might have been doubtful , even then , of his identity . ‘
75202	75221	74849	74849	I	0	’ said Squeers , after he had literally feasted his eyes , in silence , upon the culprit . ‘
75230	75231	74849	74849	I	0	’ ‘
75235	75247	75248	75248	We	2188	’ cried Mrs. Squeers , as her husband proffered his assistance . ‘
75271	75598	75248	75248	We	2188	’ With hands trembling with delight , Squeers unloosened the cord ; and Smike , to all appearance more dead than alive , was brought into the house and securely locked up in a cellar , until such time as Mr. Squeers should deem it expedient to operate upon him , in presence of the assembled school . Upon a hasty consideration of the circumstances , it may be matter of surprise to some persons , that Mr. and Mrs. Squeers should have taken so much trouble to repossess themselves of an incumbrance of which it was their wo nt to complain so loudly ; but their surprise will cease when they are informed that the manifold services of the drudge , if performed by anybody else , would have cost the establishment some ten or twelve shillings per week in the shape of wages ; and furthermore , that all runaways were , as a matter of policy , made severe examples of , at Dotheboys Hall , inasmuch as , in consequence of the limited extent of its attractions , there was but little inducement , beyond the powerful impulse of fear , for any pupil , provided with the usual number of legs and the power of using them , to remain . The news that Smike had been caught and brought back in triumph , ran like wild - fire through the hungry community , and expectation was on tiptoe all the morning . On tiptoe it was destined to remain , however , until afternoon ; when Squeers , having refreshed himself with his dinner , and further strengthened himself by an extra libation or so , made his appearance ( accompanied by his amiable partner ) with a countenance of portentous import , and a fearful instrument of flagellation , strong , supple , wax - ended , and new,--in short , purchased that morning , expressly for the occasion . ‘
75604	75652	75600	75601	every boy	1157	’ asked Squeers , in a tremendous voice . Every boy was there , but every boy was afraid to speak , so Squeers glared along the lines to assure himself ; and every eye drooped , and every head cowered down , as he did so . ‘
75659	75686	75653	75654	Each boy	8858	’ said Squeers , administering his favourite blow to the desk , and regarding with gloomy satisfaction the universal start which it never failed to occasion . ‘
75695	75897	75900	75900	I	0	’ It was remarked by more than one small observer , that there was a very curious and unusual expression in the usher ’s face ; but he took his seat , without opening his lips in reply . Squeers , casting a triumphant glance at his assistant and a look of most comprehensive despotism on the boys , left the room , and shortly afterwards returned , dragging Smike by the collar -- or rather by that fragment of his jacket which was nearest the place where his collar would have been , had he boasted such a decoration . In any other place , the appearance of the wretched , jaded , spiritless object would have occasioned a murmur of compassion and remonstrance . It had some effect , even there ; for the lookers - on moved uneasily in their seats ; and a few of the boldest ventured to steal looks at each other , expressive of indignation and pity . They were lost on Squeers , however , whose gaze was fastened on the luckless Smike , as he inquired , according to custom in such cases , whether he had anything to say for himself . ‘
75903	75946	75900	75900	I	0	’ said Squeers , with a diabolical grin . Smike glanced round , and his eye rested , for an instant , on Nicholas , as if he had expected him to intercede ; but his look was riveted on his desk . ‘
75953	75973	75948	75948	you	0	’ demanded Squeers again : giving his right arm two or three flourishes to try its power and suppleness . ‘
75995	75996	75982	75983	Mrs. Squeers	231	’ ‘
76002	76006	76000	76000	sir	714	’ cried Smike . ‘
76016	76020	76023	76023	I	0	’ said Squeers . ‘

76047	76052	76023	76023	I	0	’ laughed Mrs. Squeers , ‘

76061	76069	76071	76071	Smike	264	‘ I was driven to do it , ’
76082	76091	76093	76093	Squeers	231	‘ Driven to do it , were you ? ’
76095	76113	76093	76093	Squeers	231	‘ Oh ! it was n’t your fault ; it was mine , I suppose -- eh ? ’
76114	76131	76133	76134	Mrs. Squeers	231	‘ A nasty , ungrateful , pig - headed , brutish , obstinate , sneaking dog , ’
76152	76160	76141	76141	her	231	‘ what does he mean by that ? ’
76161	76168	76170	76170	Squeers	231	‘ Stand aside , my dear , ’
76172	76180	76170	76170	Squeers	231	‘ We ’ll try and find out . ’
76245	76248	76237	76238	Nicholas Nickleby	207	‘ Stop ! ’
76258	76263	76265	76265	Squeers	231	‘ Who cried stop ? ’
76271	76274	76276	76276	Nicholas	207	‘ I , ’
76281	76288	76276	76276	Nicholas	207	‘ This must not go on . ’
76289	76295	76297	76297	Squeers	231	‘ Must not go on ! ’
76304	76307	76309	76309	Nicholas	207	‘ No ! ’
76347	76353	76355	76355	Nicholas	207	‘ I say must not , ’
76360	76369	76355	76355	Nicholas	207	‘ shall not . I will prevent it . ’
76400	76415	76417	76417	Nicholas	207	‘ You have disregarded all my quiet interference in the miserable lad ’s behalf , ’
76419	76466	76417	76417	Nicholas	207	‘ you have returned no answer to the letter in which I begged forgiveness for him , and offered to be responsible that he would remain quietly here . Do n’t blame me for this public interference . You have brought it upon yourself ; not I. ’
76467	76473	76475	76475	Squeers	231	‘ Sit down , beggar ! ’
76490	76493	76495	76495	Nicholas	207	‘ Wretch , ’
76499	76553	76495	76495	Nicholas	207	‘ touch him at your peril ! I will not stand by , and see it done . My blood is up , and I have the strength of ten such men as you . Look to yourself , for by Heaven I will not spare you , if you drive me on ! ’
76554	76558	76560	76560	Squeers	231	‘ Stand back , ’
76566	76577	76579	76579	Nicholas	207	‘ I have a long series of insults to avenge , ’
76585	76628	76579	76579	Nicholas	207	‘ and my indignation is aggravated by the dastardly cruelties practised on helpless infancy in this foul den . Have a care ; for if you do raise the devil within me , the consequences shall fall heavily upon your own head ! ’
77316	77328	77330	77330	Nicholas	207	‘ I am in no mood for more noise and riot , ’
77332	77361	77330	77330	Nicholas	207	‘ and yet , do what I will , I shall have an altercation with this honest blockhead , and perhaps a blow or two from yonder staff . ’
77433	77439	77441	77441	John	202	‘ Servant , young genelman , ’
77443	77446	77448	77448	Nicholas	207	‘ Yours , ’

77460	77477	77441	77441	John	202	’ observed John , making the stirrup ring under a smart touch of the ash stick . ‘
77480	77486	77441	77441	John	202	’ replied Nicholas , hesitating . ‘
77489	77501	77441	77441	John	202	’ he said , frankly , after a moment ’s pause , ‘
77555	77556	77551	77551	you	2215	’ ‘
77560	77568	77551	77551	you	2215	’ cried the good - humoured Yorkshireman ; ‘
77575	77597	77551	77551	you	2215	’ at the same time , he bent down from the saddle , and gave Nicholas ’s fist a huge wrench : ‘
77604	77616	77630	77630	he	0	’ thy feace , mun ? it be all brokken loike . ’
77617	77623	77625	77625	Nicholas	207	‘ It is a cut , ’

77673	77674	77659	77660	John Browdie	202	’ ‘
77679	77693	77659	77660	John Browdie	202	’ said Nicholas , not very well knowing how to make the avowal , ‘
77706	77707	77699	77699	I	0	’ ‘
77710	77746	77699	77699	I	0	’ interposed John Browdie , in a tone of compassion ; for he was a giant in strength and stature , and Nicholas , very likely , in his eyes , seemed a mere dwarf ; ‘
77751	77752	77755	77755	I	0	’ ‘
77758	77762	77755	77755	I	0	’ replied Nicholas , ‘

77787	77806	77807	77809	Beatten the schoolmeasther	306	’ cried John Browdie , with such an ecstatic shout , that the horse quite shied at it . ‘

77855	77947	77817	77819	Beatten the schoolmeasther	2220	’ With these expressions of delight , John Browdie laughed and laughed again -- so loud that the echoes , far and wide , sent back nothing but jovial peals of merriment -- and shook Nicholas by the hand meanwhile , no less heartily . When his mirth had subsided , he inquired what Nicholas meant to do ; on his informing him , to go straight to London , he shook his head doubtfully , and inquired if he knew how much the coaches charged to carry passengers so far . ‘
77954	77958	77817	77819	Beatten the schoolmeasther	2220	’ said Nicholas ; ‘
77974	77975	78024	78026	the honest countryman	2221	’ ‘
77978	77983	77985	77985	John	202	’ to Lunnun afoot ! ’
77990	77997	77999	77999	Nicholas	207	‘ Every step of the way , ’
78001	78017	77999	77999	Nicholas	207	‘ I should be many steps further on by this time , and so goodbye ! ’
78018	78022	78024	78026	the honest countryman	2221	‘ Nay noo , ’

78053	78059	77999	77999	Nicholas	207	’ said Nicholas , colouring , ‘
78081	78125	78078	78078	you	207	’ John Browdie made no verbal answer to this remark , but putting his hand in his pocket , pulled out an old purse of solid leather , and insisted that Nicholas should borrow from him whatever he required for his present necessities . ‘
78132	78136	78130	78130	mun	2222	’ he said ; ‘
78138	78152	78078	78078	you	207	’ eneaf to carry thee whoam . Thee’lt pay me yan day , a ’
78155	78230	78078	78078	you	207	’ Nicholas could by no means be prevailed upon to borrow more than a sovereign , with which loan Mr. Browdie , after many entreaties that he would accept of more ( observing , with a touch of Yorkshire caution , that if he did n’t spend it all , he could put the surplus by , till he had an opportunity of remitting it carriage free ) , was fain to content himself . ‘
78232	78236	78078	78078	you	207	’ that bit o ’
78243	78247	78248	78248	he	2223	’ , mun , ’
78264	78278	78248	78248	he	2223	‘ keep a good heart , and bless thee . Beatten the schoolmeasther ! ‘
78291	78601	78248	78248	he	2223	’ So saying , and indulging , with more delicacy than might have been expected from him , in another series of loud laughs , for the purpose of avoiding the thanks which Nicholas poured forth , John Browdie set spurs to his horse , and went off at a smart canter : looking back , from time to time , as Nicholas stood gazing after him , and waving his hand cheerily , as if to encourage him on his way . Nicholas watched the horse and rider until they disappeared over the brow of a distant hill , and then set forward on his journey . He did not travel far that afternoon , for by this time it was nearly dark , and there had been a heavy fall of snow , which not only rendered the way toilsome , but the track uncertain and difficult to find , after daylight , save by experienced wayfarers . He lay , that night , at a cottage , where beds were let at a cheap rate to the more humble class of travellers ; and , rising betimes next morning , made his way before night to Boroughbridge . Passing through that town in search of some cheap resting - place , he stumbled upon an empty barn within a couple of hundred yards of the roadside ; in a warm corner of which , he stretched his weary limbs , and soon fell asleep . When he awoke next morning , and tried to recollect his dreams , which had been all connected with his recent sojourn at Dotheboys Hall , he sat up , rubbed his eyes and stared -- not with the most composed countenance possible -- at some motionless object which seemed to be stationed within a few yards in front of him . ‘
78604	78608	78248	78248	he	2223	’ cried Nicholas ; ‘
78640	78663	78638	78638	Smike	264	’ The form moved , rose , advanced , and dropped upon its knees at his feet . It was Smike indeed . ‘
78671	78679	78666	78666	you	264	’ said Nicholas , hastily raising him . ‘
78700	78709	78711	78711	me	0	’ replied Smike , clinging to his hand . ‘
78734	78735	78730	78730	you	264	’ ‘
78747	78753	78736	78736	I	0	’ said Nicholas , kindly . ‘
78759	78834	78835	78836	Poor fellow	926	’ He had followed him , it seemed ; had never lost sight of him all the way ; had watched while he slept , and when he halted for refreshment ; and had feared to appear before , lest he should be sent back . He had not intended to appear now , but Nicholas had awakened more suddenly than he looked for , and he had had no time to conceal himself . ‘
78838	78842	78835	78836	Poor fellow	926	’ said Nicholas , ‘
78864	78865	78867	78867	I	0	’ ‘
78875	78881	78867	78867	I	0	’ asked Smike , timidly . ‘
78902	78913	78867	78867	I	0	’ added the poor creature , drawing his rags together ; ‘
78928	78929	78920	78920	I	0	’ ‘
78934	78938	78931	78931	you	0	’ cried Nicholas . ‘
78967	79933	79938	79939	Mr. Noggs	211	’ With these words , he strapped his burden on his shoulders , and , taking his stick in one hand , extended the other to his delighted charge ; and so they passed out of the old barn , together . CHAPTER 14 Having the Misfortune to treat of none but Common People , is necessarily of a Mean and Vulgar Character In that quarter of London in which Golden Square is situated , there is a bygone , faded , tumble - down street , with two irregular rows of tall meagre houses , which seem to have stared each other out of countenance years ago . The very chimneys appear to have grown dismal and melancholy , from having had nothing better to look at than the chimneys over the way . Their tops are battered , and broken , and blackened with smoke ; and , here and there , some taller stack than the rest , inclining heavily to one side , and toppling over the roof , seems to meditate taking revenge for half a century ’s neglect , by crushing the inhabitants of the garrets beneath . The fowls who peck about the kennels , jerking their bodies hither and thither with a gait which none but town fowls are ever seen to adopt , and which any country cock or hen would be puzzled to understand , are perfectly in keeping with the crazy habitations of their owners . Dingy , ill - plumed , drowsy flutterers , sent , like many of the neighbouring children , to get a livelihood in the streets , they hop , from stone to stone , in forlorn search of some hidden eatable in the mud , and can scarcely raise a crow among them . The only one with anything approaching to a voice , is an aged bantam at the baker ’s ; and even he is hoarse , in consequence of bad living in his last place . To judge from the size of the houses , they have been , at one time , tenanted by persons of better condition than their present occupants ; but they are now let off , by the week , in floors or rooms , and every door has almost as many plates or bell - handles as there are apartments within . The windows are , for the same reason , sufficiently diversified in appearance , being ornamented with every variety of common blind and curtain that can easily be imagined ; while every doorway is blocked up , and rendered nearly impassable , by a motley collection of children and porter pots of all sizes , from the baby in arms and the half - pint pot , to the full - grown girl and half - gallon can . In the parlour of one of these houses , which was perhaps a thought dirtier than any of its neighbours ; which exhibited more bell - handles , children , and porter pots , and caught in all its freshness the first gust of the thick black smoke that poured forth , night and day , from a large brewery hard by ; hung a bill , announcing that there was yet one room to let within its walls , though on what story the vacant room could be -- regard being had to the outward tokens of many lodgers which the whole front displayed , from the mangle in the kitchen window to the flower - pots on the parapet -- it would have been beyond the power of a calculating boy to discover . The common stairs of this mansion were bare and carpetless ; but a curious visitor who had to climb his way to the top , might have observed that there were not wanting indications of the progressive poverty of the inmates , although their rooms were shut . Thus , the first - floor lodgers , being flush of furniture , kept an old mahogany table -- real mahogany -- on the landing - place outside , which was only taken in , when occasion required . On the second story , the spare furniture dwindled down to a couple of old deal chairs , of which one , belonging to the back - room , was shorn of a leg , and bottomless . The story above , boasted no greater excess than a worm - eaten wash - tub ; and the garret landing - place displayed no costlier articles than two crippled pitchers , and some broken blacking - bottles . It was on this garret landing - place that a hard - featured square - faced man , elderly and shabby , stopped to unlock the door of the front attic , into which , having surmounted the task of turning the rusty key in its still more rusty wards , he walked with the air of legal owner . This person wore a wig of short , coarse , red hair , which he took off with his hat , and hung upon a nail . Having adopted in its place a dirty cotton nightcap , and groped about in the dark till he found a remnant of candle , he knocked at the partition which divided the two garrets , and inquired , in a loud voice , whether Mr. Noggs had a light . The sounds that came back were stifled by the lath and plaster , and it seemed moreover as though the speaker had uttered them from the interior of a mug or other drinking vessel ; but they were in the voice of Newman , and conveyed a reply in the affirmative . ‘
79941	79956	79938	79939	Mr. Noggs	211	’ said the man in the nightcap , stepping in to light his candle . ‘
79961	79965	79938	79939	Mr. Noggs	211	’ asked Newman . ‘
79969	79975	79976	79976	I	0	’ replied the other pettishly . ‘
79981	79982	79976	79976	I	0	’ ‘
79998	80013	79995	79996	Mr. Crowl	308	’ said Newman , laying his hand upon the lappel of his threadbare coat . ‘
80024	80120	80121	80121	You	0	’ observed Mr. Crowl , in the same pettish tone . Uttering a low querulous growl , the speaker , whose harsh countenance was the very epitome of selfishness , raked the scanty fire nearly out of the grate , and , emptying the glass which Noggs had pushed towards him , inquired where he kept his coals . Newman Noggs pointed to the bottom of a cupboard , and Mr. Crowl , seizing the shovel , threw on half the stock : which Noggs very deliberately took off again , without saying a word . ‘
80136	80169	80133	80133	I	0	’ said Crowl . Newman pointed to the empty glass , as though it were a sufficient refutation of the charge , and briefly said that he was going downstairs to supper . ‘
80174	80182	80133	80133	I	0	’ asked Crowl . Newman nodded assent . ‘
80188	80192	80133	80133	I	0	’ said Crowl . ‘
80231	80232	80233	80233	I	0	’ ‘
80239	80243	80244	80244	They	2237	’ said Newman . ‘
80249	80250	80244	80244	They	2237	’ ‘
80261	80274	80281	80281	I	0	’ urged the selfish man , who never thought of anybody else . ‘
80298	80388	80389	80390	the Kenwigses	2238	’ Newman cast a despairing glance at his small store of fuel , but , not having the courage to say no -- a word which in all his life he never had said at the right time , either to himself or anyone else -- gave way to the proposed arrangement . Mr. Crowl immediately went about making himself as comfortable , with Newman Nogg ’s means , as circumstances would admit of his being made . The lodgers to whom Crowl had made allusion under the designation of ‘
80392	81114	80389	80390	the Kenwigses	2238	’ were the wife and olive branches of one Mr. Kenwigs , a turner in ivory , who was looked upon as a person of some consideration on the premises , inasmuch as he occupied the whole of the first floor , comprising a suite of two rooms . Mrs. Kenwigs , too , was quite a lady in her manners , and of a very genteel family , having an uncle who collected a water - rate ; besides which distinction , the two eldest of her little girls went twice a week to a dancing school in the neighbourhood , and had flaxen hair , tied with blue ribbons , hanging in luxuriant pigtails down their backs ; and wore little white trousers with frills round the ankles -- for all of which reasons , and many more equally valid but too numerous to mention , Mrs. Kenwigs was considered a very desirable person to know , and was the constant theme of all the gossips in the street , and even three or four doors round the corner at both ends . It was the anniversary of that happy day on which the Church of England as by law established , had bestowed Mrs. Kenwigs upon Mr. Kenwigs ; and in grateful commemoration of the same , Mrs. Kenwigs had invited a few select friends to cards and a supper in the first floor , and had put on a new gown to receive them in : which gown , being of a flaming colour and made upon a juvenile principle , was so successful that Mr. Kenwigs said the eight years of matrimony and the five children seemed all a dream , and Mrs. Kenwigs younger and more blooming than on the very first Sunday he had kept company with her . Beautiful as Mrs. Kenwigs looked when she was dressed though , and so stately that you would have supposed she had a cook and housemaid at least , and nothing to do but order them about , she had a world of trouble with the preparations ; more , indeed , than she , being of a delicate and genteel constitution , could have sustained , had not the pride of housewifery upheld her . At last , however , all the things that had to be got together were got together , and all the things that had to be got out of the way were got out of the way , and everything was ready , and the collector himself having promised to come , fortune smiled upon the occasion . The party was admirably selected . There were , first of all , Mr. Kenwigs and Mrs. Kenwigs , and four olive Kenwigses who sat up to supper ; firstly , because it was but right that they should have a treat on such a day ; and secondly , because their going to bed , in presence of the company , would have been inconvenient , not to say improper . Then , there was a young lady who had made Mrs. Kenwigs ’s dress , and who -- it was the most convenient thing in the world -- living in the two - pair back , gave up her bed to the baby , and got a little girl to watch it . Then , to match this young lady , was a young man , who had known Mr. Kenwigs when he was a bachelor , and was much esteemed by the ladies , as bearing the reputation of a rake . To these were added a newly - married couple , who had visited Mr. and Mrs. Kenwigs in their courtship ; and a sister of Mrs. Kenwigs ’s , who was quite a beauty ; besides whom , there was another young man , supposed to entertain honourable designs upon the lady last mentioned ; and Mr. Noggs , who was a genteel person to ask , because he had been a gentleman once . There were also an elderly lady from the back - parlour , and one more young lady , who , next to the collector , perhaps was the great lion of the party , being the daughter of a theatrical fireman , who ‘
81117	81250	80389	80390	the Kenwigses	2238	’ in the pantomime , and had the greatest turn for the stage that was ever known , being able to sing and recite in a manner that brought the tears into Mrs. Kenwigs ’s eyes . There was only one drawback upon the pleasure of seeing such friends , and that was , that the lady in the back - parlour , who was very fat , and turned of sixty , came in a low book - muslin dress and short kid gloves , which so exasperated Mrs Kenwigs , that that lady assured her visitors , in private , that if it had n’t happened that the supper was cooking at the back - parlour grate at that moment , she certainly would have requested its representative to withdraw . ‘
81254	81259	80389	80390	the Kenwigses	2238	’ said Mr. Kenwigs , ‘
81271	81272	81273	81273	Kenwigs	310	’ ‘
81278	81283	81273	81273	Kenwigs	310	’ returned his wife , ‘
81297	81298	81291	81291	you	310	’ ‘
81304	81308	81301	81302	the collector	10290	’ said Kenwigs ; ‘
81317	81318	81301	81302	the collector	10290	’ ‘
81324	81336	81319	81319	He	8478	’ said Mrs. Kenwigs , turning to the other married lady , ‘
81354	81355	81356	81356	Dear	9456	’ ‘
81358	81364	81356	81356	Dear	9456	’ cried the married lady . ‘
81373	81378	81370	81370	he	8478	’ replied Mrs. Kenwigs ; ‘
81389	81390	81391	81397	The kindest - hearted man as ever	2245	’ ‘
81400	81404	81391	81397	The kindest - hearted man as ever	2245	’ said Kenwigs . ‘
81430	81440	81441	81441	George	313	’ observed the bachelor friend , intending a joke . ‘
81443	81450	81441	81441	George	313	’ said Mr. Kenwigs , solemnly , ‘
81459	81460	81441	81441	George	313	’ ‘
81467	81474	81475	81475	George	313	’ said the friend , abashed . ‘
81477	81482	81475	81475	George	313	’ rejoined Mr. Kenwigs , ‘
81614	81621	81613	81613	my--	2250	’ Mr. Kenwigs was going to say ‘
81624	81631	81613	81613	my--	2250	’ but he rounded the sentence with ‘
81633	81680	81683	81683	him	10290	’ . At the conclusion of these observations , which drew forth evidences of acute feeling from Mrs. Kenwigs , and had the intended effect of impressing the company with a deep sense of the collector ’s dignity , a ring was heard at the bell . ‘
81685	81693	81683	81683	him	10290	’ whispered Mr. Kenwigs , greatly excited . ‘
81724	81839	81842	81842	uncle	8733	’ Adopting Mr. Kenwigs ’s suggestion , the company spoke very loudly , to look easy and unembarrassed ; and almost as soon as they had begun to do so , a short old gentleman in drabs and gaiters , with a face that might have been carved out of LIGNUM VITAE , for anything that appeared to the contrary , was led playfully in by Miss Morleena Kenwigs , regarding whose uncommon Christian name it may be here remarked that it had been invented and composed by Mrs. Kenwigs previous to her first lying - in , for the special distinction of her eldest child , in case it should prove a daughter . ‘
81852	81865	81844	81844	I	0	’ said Mrs. Kenwigs , kissing the collector affectionately on both cheeks . ‘
81869	81870	81842	81842	uncle	8733	’ ‘
81881	81959	81842	81842	uncle	8733	’ replied the collector , returning the compliment . Now , this was an interesting thing . Here was a collector of water - rates , without his book , without his pen and ink , without his double knock , without his intimidation , kissing -- actually kissing -- an agreeable female , and leaving taxes , summonses , notices that he had called , or announcements that he would never call again , for two quarters ’
82009	82017	82019	82020	Mrs. Kenwigs	310	‘ Where will you sit , uncle ? ’
82039	82045	82047	82048	the collector	10290	‘ Anywheres , my dear , ’
82050	82056	82047	82048	the collector	10290	‘ I am not particular . ’
82085	82089	82091	82091	Kenwigs	310	‘ Mr. Lillyvick , ’
82097	82123	82091	82091	Kenwigs	310	‘ some friends here , sir , are very anxious for the honour of -- thank you -- Mr. and Mrs Cutler , Mr. Lillyvick . ’
82124	82132	82134	82135	Mr. Cutler	318	‘ Proud to know you , sir , ’
82137	82146	82134	82135	Mr. Cutler	318	‘ I ’ve heerd of you very often . ’
82186	82198	82200	82200	Kenwigs	310	‘ George , you know , I think , Mr. Lillyvick , ’
82202	82256	82200	82200	Kenwigs	310	‘ lady from downstairs -- Mr. Lillyvick . Mr. Snewkes -- Mr. Lillyvick . Miss Green -- Mr Lillyvick . Mr. Lillyvick -- Miss Petowker of the Theatre Royal , Drury Lane . Very glad to make two public characters acquainted ! Mrs. Kenwigs , my dear , will you sort the counters ? ’
82814	82820	82822	82823	Mrs. Kenwigs	310	‘ They are so beautiful ! ’
82827	82832	82834	82836	all the ladies	2287	‘ Oh , dear , ’
82838	82863	82834	82836	all the ladies	2287	‘ so they are ! it ’s very natural you should feel proud of that ; but do n’t give way , do n’t . ’
82864	82878	82880	82881	Mrs. Kenwigs	310	‘ I can -- not help it , and it do n’t signify , ’
82883	82887	82880	82881	Mrs. Kenwigs	310	‘ oh ! they ’re
82897	83081	82834	82836	all the ladies	2287	’ On hearing this alarming presentiment of their being doomed to an early death in the flower of their infancy , all four little girls raised a hideous cry , and burying their heads in their mother ’s lap simultaneously , screamed until the eight flaxen tails vibrated again ; Mrs. Kenwigs meanwhile clasping them alternately to her bosom , with attitudes expressive of distraction , which Miss Petowker herself might have copied . At length , the anxious mother permitted herself to be soothed into a more tranquil state , and the little Kenwigses , being also composed , were distributed among the company , to prevent the possibility of Mrs. Kenwigs being again overcome by the blaze of their combined beauty . This done , the ladies and gentlemen united in prophesying that they would live for many , many years , and that there was no occasion at all for Mrs. Kenwigs to distress herself ; which , in good truth , there did not appear to be ; the loveliness of the children by no means justifying her apprehensions . ‘
83087	83095	82834	82836	all the ladies	2287	’ said Mr. Kenwigs after a pause . ‘
83101	83112	83097	83097	me	0	’ This reflection was echoed by all present , who said ‘
83115	83119	83121	83121	me	0	’ first , and ‘
83123	83126	83121	83121	me	0	’ afterwards . ‘
83132	83137	83127	83127	I	0	’ tittered Mrs. Kenwigs . ‘
83140	83145	83127	83127	I	0	’ said the collector . ‘
83149	83153	83127	83127	I	0	’ added everybody . ‘
83159	83172	83175	83175	her	8979	’ said Mr. Lillyvick , surveying his audience with a grave air ; ‘
83207	83208	83198	83198	she	8979	’ ‘
83219	83224	83214	83214	I	0	’ interposed Mrs. Kenwigs . ‘
83236	83243	83230	83230	I	0	’ said the collector , firmly . ‘
83251	83258	83249	83249	uncle	8733	’ replied Mrs. Kenwigs , submissively . ‘
83267	83268	83273	83274	my dear	702	’ ‘
83276	83281	83273	83274	my dear	702	’ retorted Mr. Lillyvick . ‘
83313	83324	83303	83304	her mother	1123	’ A general exclamation of astonishment burst from the company . ‘
83329	83341	83303	83304	her mother	1123	’ repeated Mr. Lillyvick , regarding them with a rigid look . ‘
83384	83385	83382	83382	Kenwigs	310	’ ‘
83388	83419	83382	83382	Kenwigs	310	’ replied that gentleman , in no way displeased at the reminiscence , inasmuch as it proved , beyond all doubt , what a high family Mrs. Kenwigs came of . ‘
83426	83431	83420	83420	I	0	’ said Mr. Lillyvick : ‘
83442	83471	83472	83472	I	0	’ A gentle murmur seemed to say , that , in one of Mr. Lillyvick ’s station , the objection was not only natural , but highly praiseworthy . ‘
83480	83485	83472	83472	I	0	’ said Mr. Lillyvick . ‘
83569	83570	83571	83571	I	0	’ ‘

83611	83615	83609	83609	sir	714	’ said Kenwigs . ‘
83630	83635	83628	83628	sir	714	’ remarked Mr Lillyvick . ‘
83639	83651	83636	83637	Morleena Kenwigs	314	’ cried her mother , at this crisis , much affected , ‘
83657	83703	83636	83637	Morleena Kenwigs	314	’ The young lady did as she was requested , and the three other little girls were successively hoisted up to the collector ’s countenance , and subjected to the same process , which was afterwards repeated on them by the majority of those present . ‘
83710	83715	83707	83708	Mrs. Kenwigs	310	’ said Miss Petowker , ‘
83741	83742	83738	83739	Mr. Lillyvick	316	’ ‘
83750	83755	83738	83739	Mr. Lillyvick	316	’ replied Mrs. Kenwigs , ‘
83763	83764	83765	83765	It	2311	’ ‘
83775	83780	83771	83771	I	0	’ said Miss Petowker . ‘

83854	83888	83840	83841	Miss Petowker	320	’ There was a great clapping of hands and stamping of feet , at this proposition ; the subject whereof , gently inclined her head several times , in acknowledgment of the reception . ‘
83892	83899	83840	83841	Miss Petowker	320	’ said Miss Petowker , reproachfully , ‘
83910	83911	83901	83901	I	0	’ ‘
83918	83923	83901	83901	I	0	’ said Mrs. Kenwigs . ‘

83959	83964	83953	83953	I	0	’ interrupted Miss Petowker ; ‘
83977	84088	83970	83970	I	0	’ Mrs. Kenwigs and Miss Petowker had arranged a small PROGRAMME of the entertainments between them , of which this was the prescribed order , but they had settled to have a little pressing on both sides , because it looked more natural . The company being all ready , Miss Petowker hummed a tune , and Morleena danced a dance ; having previously had the soles of her shoes chalked , with as much care as if she were going on the tight - rope . It was a very beautiful figure , comprising a great deal of work for the arms , and was received with unbounded applause . ‘
84098	84105	83970	83970	I	0	’ said Miss Petowker , blushing , ‘
84122	84147	84112	84112	I	0	’ Mrs. Kenwigs sighed , and looked at Mr. Kenwigs , who shook his head , and observed that he was doubtful about it . ‘

84239	84249	84227	84227	you	2320	’ observed Mrs. Kenwigs , looking at her husband . ‘
84253	84278	84279	84280	Mr. Kenwigs	312	’ faltered Miss Petowker,--‘it may be no rule to be sure -- but I have never found any inconvenience or unpleasantness of that sort . ’

84526	84590	84517	84517	Crowl	308	‘ The baby is very comfortable , for I peeped into the room as I came down , and it ’s fast asleep , and so is the girl ; and I do n’t think the candle will set fire to the bed - curtain , unless a draught was to get into the room -- it ’s Mr. Noggs that ’s wanted . ’
84591	84594	84596	84596	Newman	211	‘ Me ! ’
84601	84614	84616	84616	Crowl	308	‘ Why , it IS a queer hour , is n’t it ? ’
84631	84657	84616	84616	Crowl	308	‘ and they are queer - looking people , too , all covered with rain and mud . Shall I tell them to go away ? ’
84658	84661	84663	84663	Newman	211	‘ No , ’
84667	84673	84663	84663	Newman	211	‘ People ? How many ? ’

84802	84811	84795	84795	Crowl	308	‘ Hark ! Is there any noise above ? ’
85086	85092	85094	85094	Newman	211	‘ You are wet through , ’

85136	85157	85159	85159	Nicholas	207	‘ I have dry clothes , or at least such as will serve my turn well , in my bundle , ’
85161	85201	85202	85202	Newman	211	‘ If you look so distressed to see me , you will add to the pain I feel already , at being compelled , for one night , to cast myself upon your slender means for aid and shelter . ’
85579	85582	85584	85584	Newman	211	‘ Well , ’
85591	85595	85584	85584	Newman	211	‘ both well . ’
85596	85605	85607	85607	Nicholas	207	‘ They are living in the city still ? ’
85609	85613	85615	85615	Newman	211	‘ They are , ’
85617	85623	85615	85615	Newman	211	‘ And my sister,’--added Nicholas . ‘
85645	85713	85632	85632	she	936	’ Newman opened his eyes rather wider than usual , but merely replied by a gasp , which , according to the action of the head that accompanied it , was interpreted by his friends as meaning yes or no . In the present instance , the pantomime consisted of a nod , and not a shake ; so Nicholas took the answer as a favourable one . ‘
85719	85731	85717	85717	me	0	’ said Nicholas , laying his hand on Newman ’s shoulder . ‘
85781	85823	85779	85779	Yorkshire	3	’ Newman opened and shut his mouth , several times , as though he were trying his utmost to speak , but could make nothing of it , and finally fixed his eyes on Nicholas with a grim and ghastly stare . ‘
85829	85835	85826	85826	he	8478	’ urged Nicholas , colouring . ‘
85907	85908	85901	85901	me	0	’ ‘
85912	85916	85901	85901	me	0	’ said Newman ; ‘

85951	85957	85945	85945	I	0	’ answered Nicholas , impatiently . ‘

86001	86007	85995	85995	I	0	’ said Newman , hesitating . ‘
86021	86025	86011	86011	you	211	’ rejoined Nicholas ; ‘
86139	86220	86221	86221	My	0	’ With this gentle allusion to the absent Mr. Squeers , Nicholas repressed his rising wrath , and relating to Newman exactly what had passed at Dotheboys Hall , entreated him to speak out without more pressing . Thus adjured , Mr. Noggs took , from an old trunk , a sheet of paper , which appeared to have been scrawled over in great haste ; and after sundry extraordinary demonstrations of reluctance , delivered himself in the following terms . ‘
86282	86358	86280	86280	myself	0	’ Newman accompanied this very unusual outbreak with a violent blow upon the table , as if , in the heat of the moment , he had mistaken it for the chest or ribs of Mr. Wackford Squeers . Having , by this open declaration of his feelings , quite precluded himself from offering Nicholas any cautious worldly advice ( which had been his first intention ) , Mr. Noggs went straight to the point . ‘
86364	86368	86369	86370	your uncle	8729	’ said Newman , ‘

86399	86410	86396	86396	you	0	’ replied Nicholas . Newman Noggs accordingly read as follows : ‘
86414	86418	86419	86419	SIR	714	‘ THURSDAY MORNING . ‘
86421	86453	86419	86419	SIR	714	‘ My pa requests me to write to you , the doctors considering it doubtful whether he will ever recuvver the use of his legs which prevents his holding a pen . ‘
86514	86606	86607	86607	Me	0	‘ When your nevew that you recommended for a teacher had done this to my pa and jumped upon his body with his feet and also langwedge which I will not pollewt my pen with describing , he assaulted my ma with dreadful violence , dashed her to the earth , and drove her back comb several inches into her head . A very little more and it must have entered her skull . We have a medical certifiket that if it had , the tortershell would have affected the brain . ‘
86680	86806	86807	86807	I	0	‘ The monster having sasiated his thirst for blood ran away , taking with him a boy of desperate character that he had excited to rebellyon , and a garnet ring belonging to my ma , and not having been apprehended by the constables is supposed to have been took up by some stage - coach . My pa begs that if he comes to you the ring may be returned , and that you will let the thief and assassin go , as if we prosecuted him he would only be transported , and if he is let go he is sure to be hung before long which will save us trouble and be much more satisfactory . Hoping to hear from you when convenient ‘
86809	86813	86807	86807	I	0	‘ Yours and cetrer ‘

86942	86946	86920	86920	Nicholas	207	’ cried Newman . ‘
86949	86953	86920	86920	Nicholas	207	’ said Nicholas , ‘
87032	87033	87034	87034	They	2364	’ ‘
87037	87041	87042	87042	They	2364	’ said Newman . ‘
87048	87061	87042	87042	They	2364	’ rejoined Nicholas firmly , as he prepared to leave the house . ‘
87066	87078	87063	87063	me	0	’ said Newman , planting himself before his impetuous young friend . ‘
87112	87113	87100	87100	I	0	’ ‘
87120	87136	87115	87115	you	0	’ asked Nicholas , chafing violently , and pacing the narrow room with rapid strides . ‘
87139	87143	87144	87144	He	208	’ rejoined Newman . ‘

87172	87178	87169	87169	you	0	’ demanded Nicholas , precipitately ; ‘

87221	87302	87219	87219	me	0	’ said Newman , speaking for the moment , in his earnestness , like any other man--‘make no effort to see even them , till he comes home . I know the man . Do not seem to have been tampering with anybody . When he returns , go straight to him , and speak as boldly as you like . Guessing at the real truth , he knows it as well as you or I. Trust him for that . ’
87303	87319	87321	87321	Nicholas	207	‘ You mean well to me , and should know him better than I can , ’
87327	87335	87336	87336	Newman	211	‘ Well ; let it be so . ’
87490	87496	87497	87497	Lor	269	’ sudden disappearance and detention . ‘
87505	87510	87499	87499	I	0	’ said Mrs. Kenwigs . ‘

87535	87540	87533	87533	me	0	’ said Mr. Kenwigs ; ‘
87569	87570	87571	87571	Kenwigs	310	’ ‘
87573	87583	87584	87584	I	0	’ said Mr. Lillyvick , in a loud voice , ‘
87585	87590	87627	87628	Mr. Lillyvick	316	’m surprised at you . ’
87591	87599	87601	87602	Mr. Kenwigs	312	‘ What ’s the matter , sir ? ’
87615	87625	87627	87628	Mr. Lillyvick	316	‘ Making such a remark as that , sir , ’
87632	87855	87627	87628	Mr. Lillyvick	316	‘ He has had punch already , has he not , sir ? I consider the way in which that punch was cut off , if I may use the expression , highly disrespectful to this company ; scandalous , perfectly scandalous . It may be the custom to allow such things in this house , but it ’s not the kind of behaviour that I ’ve been used to see displayed , and so I do n’t mind telling you , Kenwigs . A gentleman has a glass of punch before him to which he is just about to set his lips , when another gentleman comes and collars that glass of punch , without a “ with your leave ” , or “ by your leave ” , and carries that glass of punch away . This may be good manners -- I dare say it is -- but I do n’t understand it , that ’s all ; and what ’s more , I do n’t care if I never do . It ’s my way to speak my mind , Kenwigs , and that is my mind ; and if you do n’t like it , it ’s past my regular time for going to bed , and I can find my way home without making it later . ’
87926	87934	87936	87937	Mr. Kenwigs	312	‘ I am very sorry , sir , ’
87941	87947	87936	87937	Mr. Kenwigs	312	‘ Do n’t tell me you ’re
87950	87959	87936	87937	Mr. Kenwigs	312	’ retorted Mr. Lillyvick , with much sharpness . ‘
87968	88036	87960	87960	You	312	’ The company were quite paralysed by this domestic crash . The back - parlour sat with her mouth wide open , staring vacantly at the collector , in a stupor of dismay ; the other guests were scarcely less overpowered by the great man ’s irritation . Mr. Kenwigs , not being skilful in such matters , only fanned the flame in attempting to extinguish it . ‘
88050	88055	88044	88044	I	0	’ said that gentleman . ‘
88078	88079	88073	88073	you	714	’ ‘
88099	88104	88088	88088	you	714	’ said the collector . ‘

88152	88158	88141	88142	Mr. Lillyvick	316	‘ Morleena , my hat ! ’
88228	88238	88240	88241	Mr. Lillyvick	316	‘ Why should I stop here , my dears ? ’
88243	88245	88240	88241	Mr. Lillyvick	316	‘ I ’m

88262	88267	88260	88260	uncle	8733	’ sobbed Mrs. Kenwigs , ‘
88275	88276	88277	88277	I	0	’ ‘
88290	88300	88282	88283	some people	8714	’ replied Mr Lillyvick , glancing angrily at Kenwigs . ‘
88305	88306	88282	88283	some people	8714	’ ‘
88323	88328	88315	88315	him	2391	’ cried Mrs Kenwigs . ‘
88338	88339	88340	88341	Mr. Lillyvick	316	’ ‘
88343	88347	88340	88341	Mr. Lillyvick	316	’ said Kenwigs , ‘
88367	88402	88359	88359	you	8733	’ The collector ’s features relaxed , as the company added their entreaties to those of his nephew - in - law . He gave up his hat , and held out his hand . ‘
88407	88412	88359	88359	you	8733	’ said Mr. Lillyvick ; ‘
88467	88468	88469	88470	Morleena Kenwigs	314	’ ‘
88472	88483	88469	88470	Morleena Kenwigs	314	’ cried her mother , in a torrent of affection . ‘
88522	88703	88704	88704	I	0	’ Miss Morleena approaching to do homage , in compliance with this injunction , was summarily caught up and kissed by Mr. Lillyvick ; and thereupon Mrs. Kenwigs darted forward and kissed the collector , and an irrepressible murmur of applause broke from the company who had witnessed his magnanimity . The worthy gentleman then became once more the life and soul of the society ; being again reinstated in his old post of lion , from which high station the temporary distraction of their thoughts had for a moment dispossessed him . Quadruped lions are said to be savage , only when they are hungry ; biped lions are rarely sulky longer than when their appetite for distinction remains unappeased . Mr. Lillyvick stood higher than ever ; for he had shown his power ; hinted at his property and testamentary intentions ; gained great credit for disinterestedness and virtue ; and , in addition to all , was finally accommodated with a much larger tumbler of punch than that which Newman Noggs had so feloniously made off with . ‘
88716	88727	88707	88707	I	0	’ said Crowl , looking in at this happy juncture ; ‘
88772	88773	88755	88755	nobody	8541	’ ‘
88790	88795	88786	88786	sir	714	’ said the collector ; ‘
88815	88816	88802	88802	himself	211	’ ‘
88823	88827	88802	88802	himself	211	’ rejoined Crowl ; ‘
88853	88854	88837	88837	I	0	’ ‘
88863	88887	88857	88857	you	714	’ demanded the collector , who seemed , by a tacit understanding , to have been chosen and elected mouthpiece to the company . ‘
88912	88967	88909	88909	I	0	’ Mr. Crowl , with a look of some contempt , was about to enter a general protest against the payment of rates or taxes , under any circumstances , when he was checked by a timely whisper from Kenwigs , and several frowns and winks from Mrs. K. , which providentially stopped him . ‘
88973	88992	88998	88998	they	2408	’ said Crowl , who had been listening at Newman ’s door with all his might and main ; ‘
89091	89209	89210	89211	Poor dear!’--‘I	2414	’ Mrs. Kenwigs was so overpowered by this supposition , that it needed all the tender attentions of Miss Petowker , of the Theatre Royal , Drury Lane , to restore her to anything like a state of calmness ; not to mention the assiduity of Mr. Kenwigs , who held a fat smelling - bottle to his lady ’s nose , until it became matter of some doubt whether the tears which coursed down her face were the result of feelings or SAL VOLATILE . The ladies , having expressed their sympathy , singly and separately , fell , according to custom , into a little chorus of soothing expressions , among which , such condolences as ‘
89231	89244	89210	89211	Poor dear!’--‘I	2414	‘ Nobody but a mother knows what a mother ’s feelings is , ’
89425	89437	89439	89440	the sister	2422	‘ Mr. Kenwigs , see what it is ; make haste ! ’
89456	89473	89439	89440	the sister	2422	‘ Oh do n’t twist about so , dear , or I can never hold you . ’
89474	89488	89490	89491	Mrs Kenwigs	310	‘ My baby , my blessed , blessed , blessed , blessed baby ! ’
89501	89528	89490	89491	Mrs Kenwigs	310	‘ My own darling , sweet , innocent Lillyvick -- Oh let me go to him . Let me go - o - o - o ! ’
89619	89625	89627	89627	Nicholas	207	‘ Do n’t be alarmed , ’
89632	89657	89627	89627	Nicholas	207	‘ here it is ; it ’s all out , it ’s all over ; pray compose yourselves ; there ’s no harm done ; ’
89814	89821	89823	89823	Nicholas	207	‘ It is a mere nothing , ’
89830	89856	89823	89823	Nicholas	207	‘ the little girl , who was watching the child , being tired I suppose , fell asleep , and set her hair on fire . ’
89857	89864	89866	89867	Mrs. Kenwigs	310	‘ Oh you malicious little wretch ! ’
89898	89904	89906	89906	Nicholas	207	‘ I heard her cries , ’
89908	89953	89906	89906	Nicholas	207	‘ and ran down , in time to prevent her setting fire to anything else . You may depend upon it that the child is not hurt ; for I took it off the bed myself , and brought it here to convince you . ’
90074	90086	90088	90089	Mrs. Kenwigs	310	‘ And whatever we are to say to you , sir , ’
90097	90106	90088	90089	Mrs. Kenwigs	310	‘ I am sure I do n’t know . ’
90107	90115	90117	90117	Nicholas	207	‘ You need say nothing at all , ’
90119	90138	90117	90117	Nicholas	207	‘ I have done nothing to found any very strong claim upon your eloquence , I am sure . ’
90139	90158	90160	90161	Miss Petowker	320	‘ He might have been burnt to death , if it had n’t been for you , sir , ’
90163	90171	90173	90173	Nicholas	207	‘ Not very likely , I think , ’
90175	90197	90173	90173	Nicholas	207	‘ for there was abundance of assistance here , which must have reached him before he had been in any danger . ’
90198	90211	90213	90214	Mr. Kenwigs	312	‘ You will let us drink your health , anyvays , sir ! ’
90220	90229	90231	90231	Nicholas	207	‘ --In my absence , by all means , ’
90237	90312	90231	90231	Nicholas	207	‘ I have had a very fatiguing journey , and should be most indifferent company -- a far greater check upon your merriment , than a promoter of it , even if I kept awake , which I think very doubtful . If you will allow me , I ’ll return to my friend , Mr. Noggs , who went upstairs again , when he found nothing serious had occurred . Good - night . ’
90353	90360	90362	90363	Mrs. Kenwigs	310	‘ What a delightful young man ! ’
90365	90371	90373	90374	Mr. Kenwigs	312	‘ Uncommon gentlemanly , really , ’

I do say -- and Mrs. Kenwigs is of the same sentiment , and feels it as strong as I do -- that I consider his being called Lillyvick one of the greatest blessings and Honours of my existence . ’

94123	94381	94382	94383	Mr. Gregsbury	334	’ feet , impels the sound towards its entrance -- the weak , shrill voice of some young member practising tomorrow ’s speech . All the livelong day , there is a grinding of organs and clashing and clanging of little boxes of music ; for Manchester Buildings is an eel - pot , which has no outlet but its awkward mouth -- a case - bottle which has no thoroughfare , and a short and narrow neck -- and in this respect it may be typical of the fate of some few among its more adventurous residents , who , after wriggling themselves into Parliament by violent efforts and contortions , find that it , too , is no thoroughfare for them ; that , like Manchester Buildings , it leads to nothing beyond itself ; and that they are fain at last to back out , no wiser , no richer , not one whit more famous , than they went in . Into Manchester Buildings Nicholas turned , with the address of the great Mr. Gregsbury in his hand . As there was a stream of people pouring into a shabby house not far from the entrance , he waited until they had made their way in , and then making up to the servant , ventured to inquire if he knew where Mr. Gregsbury lived . The servant was a very pale , shabby boy , who looked as if he had slept underground from his infancy , as very likely he had . ‘
94385	94389	94382	94383	Mr. Gregsbury	334	’ said he ; ‘
94403	94629	94382	94383	Mr. Gregsbury	334	’ Nicholas thought he might as well get in while he could , so in he walked ; and he had no sooner done so , than the boy shut the door , and made off . This was odd enough : but what was more embarrassing was , that all along the passage , and all along the narrow stairs , blocking up the window , and making the dark entry darker still , was a confused crowd of persons with great importance depicted in their looks ; who were , to all appearance , waiting in silent expectation of some coming event . From time to time , one man would whisper to his neighbour , or a little group would whisper together , and then the whisperers would nod fiercely to each other , or give their heads a relentless shake , as if they were bent upon doing something very desperate , and were determined not to be put off , whatever happened . As a few minutes elapsed without anything occurring to explain this phenomenon , and as he felt his own position a peculiarly uncomfortable one , Nicholas was on the point of seeking some information from the man next him , when a sudden move was visible on the stairs , and a voice was heard to cry , ‘
94641	94786	94787	94787	Gentlemen	681	’ So far from walking up , the gentlemen on the stairs began to walk down with great alacrity , and to entreat , with extraordinary politeness , that the gentlemen nearest the street would go first ; the gentlemen nearest the street retorted , with equal courtesy , that they could n’t think of such a thing on any account ; but they did it , without thinking of it , inasmuch as the other gentlemen pressing some half - dozen ( among whom was Nicholas ) forward , and closing up behind , pushed them , not merely up the stairs , but into the very sitting - room of Mr. Gregsbury , which they were thus compelled to enter with most unseemly precipitation , and without the means of retreat ; the press behind them , more than filling the apartment . ‘
94789	94794	94787	94787	Gentlemen	681	’ said Mr. Gregsbury , ‘
94806	94895	94804	94804	you	681	’ For a gentleman who was rejoiced to see a body of visitors , Mr. Gregsbury looked as uncomfortable as might be ; but perhaps this was occasioned by senatorial gravity , and a statesmanlike habit of keeping his feelings under control . He was a tough , burly , thick - headed gentleman , with a loud voice , a pompous manner , a tolerable command of sentences with no meaning in them , and , in short , every requisite for a very good member indeed . ‘
94900	94933	94934	94934	you	681	’ said Mr. Gregsbury , tossing a great bundle of papers into a wicker basket at his feet , and throwing himself back in his chair with his arms over the elbows , ‘
94947	94948	94934	94934	you	681	’ ‘
94957	94981	94951	94952	Mr. Gregsbury	334	’ said a plump old gentleman in a violent heat , bursting out of the throng , and planting himself in the front . ‘

Whether I look at home , or abroad ; whether I behold the peaceful industrious communities of our island home : her rivers covered with steamboats , her roads with locomotives , her streets with cabs , her skies with balloons of a power and magnitude hitherto unknown in the history of aeronautics in this or any other nation -- I say , whether I look merely at home , or , stretching my eyes farther , contemplate the boundless prospect of conquest and possession -- achieved by British perseverance and British valour -- which is outspread before me , I clasp my hands , and turning my eyes to the broad expanse above my head , exclaim , “ Thank Heaven , I am a Briton ! ” ’

95372	95450	95369	95370	Mr. Gregsbury	334	‘ is unknown to me . If it means that I grow a little too fervid , or perhaps even hyperbolical , in extolling my native land , I admit the full justice of the remark . I AM proud of this free and happy country . My form dilates , my eye glistens , my breast heaves , my heart swells , my bosom burns , when I call to mind her greatness and her glory . ’
95451	95457	95459	95460	Mr. Pugstyles	336	‘ We wish , sir , ’
95464	95472	95459	95460	Mr. Pugstyles	336	‘ to ask you a few questions . ’
95473	95492	95494	95495	Mr. Gregsbury	334	‘ If you please , gentlemen ; my time is yours -- and my country’s -- and my country’s-- ’
95559	95676	95553	95554	Mr. Pugstyles	336	‘ Question number one.--Whether , sir , you did not give a voluntary pledge previous to your election , that in event of your being returned , you would immediately put down the practice of coughing and groaning in the House of Commons . And whether you did not submit to be coughed and groaned down in the very first debate of the session , and have since made no effort to effect a reform in this respect ? Whether you did not also pledge yourself to astonish the government , and make them shrink in their shoes ? And whether you have astonished them , and made them shrink in their shoes , or not ? ’
95677	95689	95691	95692	Mr. Gregsbury	334	‘ Go on to the next one , my dear Pugstyles , ’
95694	95709	95711	95712	Mr. Pugstyles	336	‘ Have you any explanation to offer with reference to that question , sir ? ’
95714	95718	95720	95721	Mr. Gregsbury	334	‘ Certainly not , ’

95831	95835	95837	95838	Mr. Gregsbury	334	‘ Go on , ’
95840	95851	95853	95854	the spokesman	2611	‘ Nothing to say on that , either , sir ? ’

96086	96091	96081	96081	he	334	‘ I deny everything . ’
96133	96136	96143	96143	his	334	‘ Resign ! ’
96155	96167	96169	96170	Mr. Pugstyles	336	‘ I am requested , sir , to express a hope , ’
96177	96217	96169	96170	Mr. Pugstyles	336	‘ that on receiving a requisition to that effect from a great majority of your constituents , you will not object at once to resign your seat in favour of some candidate whom they think they can better trust . ’

96469	96595	96467	96467	you	0	’ said Mr. Gregsbury . And the deputation , with many growls and scowls , filed off as quickly as the narrowness of the staircase would allow of their getting down . The last man being gone , Mr. Gregsbury rubbed his hands and chuckled , as merry fellows will , when they think they have said or done a more than commonly good thing ; he was so engrossed in this self - congratulation , that he did not observe that Nicholas had been left behind in the shadow of the window - curtains , until that young gentleman , fearing he might otherwise overhear some soliloquy intended to have no listeners , coughed twice or thrice , to attract the member ’s notice . ‘
96600	96616	96467	96467	you	0	’ said Mr. Gregsbury , in sharp accents . Nicholas stepped forward , and bowed . ‘

96907	96947	96956	96956	you	0	’ Nicholas took a chair , and Mr. Gregsbury stared at him for a long time , as if to make certain , before he asked any further questions , that there were no objections to his outward appearance . ‘

98539	98567	98569	98570	Mr Gregsbury	334	‘ That is as much as to say that you had rather not accept the place , and that you consider fifteen shillings a week too little , ’
98574	98582	98569	98570	Mr Gregsbury	334	‘ Do you decline it , sir ? ’
98583	98593	98595	98595	Nicholas	207	‘ I have no alternative but to do so , ’
98597	98602	98604	98605	Mr. Gregsbury	334	‘ Door , Matthews ! ’
98612	98624	98626	98626	Nicholas	207	‘ I am sorry I have troubled you unnecessarily , sir , ’
98628	98635	98637	98638	Mr. Gregsbury	334	‘ I am sorry you have , ’
98646	98651	98641	98641	his	334	‘ Door , Matthews ! ’
98652	98659	98661	98661	Nicholas	207	‘ Good - morning , sir , ’
98663	98668	98670	98671	Mr. Gregsbury	334	‘ Door , Matthews ! ’
98790	98794	98796	98796	Newman	211	‘ Come back ? ’
98798	98801	98803	98803	Nicholas	207	‘ Yes , ’
98805	98829	98803	98803	Nicholas	207	‘ tired to death : and , what is worse , might have remained at home for all the good I have done . ’
98830	98841	98843	98843	Newman	211	‘ Could n’t expect to do much in one morning , ’
98845	98858	98860	98860	Nicholas	207	‘ Maybe so , but I am sanguine , and did expect , ’
98862	98868	98860	98860	Nicholas	207	‘ and am proportionately disappointed . ’
98881	98888	98890	98890	Nicholas	207	‘ If I could do anything , ’
98892	98945	98890	98890	Nicholas	207	‘ anything , however slight , until Ralph Nickleby returns , and I have eased my mind by confronting him , I should feel happier . I should think it no disgrace to work , Heaven knows . Lying indolently here , like a half - tamed sullen beast , distracts me . ’
98946	98952	98954	98954	Newman	211	‘ I do n’t know , ’
98956	98992	98954	98954	Newman	211	‘ small things offer -- they would pay the rent , and more -- but you would n’t like them ; no , you could hardly be expected to undergo it -- no , no . ’
98993	99003	99005	99005	Nicholas	207	‘ What could I hardly be expected to undergo ? ’
99011	99068	99070	99070	Nicholas	207	‘ Show me , in this wide waste of London , any honest means by which I could even defray the weekly hire of this poor room , and see if I shrink from resorting to them ! Undergo ! I have undergone too much , my friend , to feel pride or squeamishness now . Except-- ’
99078	99128	99070	99070	Nicholas	207	‘ except such squeamishness as is common honesty , and so much pride as constitutes self - respect . I see little to choose , between assistant to a brutal pedagogue , and toad - eater to a mean and ignorant upstart , be he member or no member . ’
99129	99147	99149	99149	Newman	211	‘ I hardly know whether I should tell you what I heard this morning , or not , ’
99151	99162	99164	99164	Nicholas	207	‘ Has it reference to what you said just now ? ’
99166	99170	99164	99164	Nicholas	207	‘ It has . ’
99171	99186	99188	99188	Nicholas	207	‘ Then in Heaven ’s name , my good friend , tell it me , ’
99190	99228	99188	99188	Nicholas	207	‘ For God ’s sake consider my deplorable condition ; and , while I promise to take no step without taking counsel with you , give me , at least , a vote in my own behalf . ’
99457	99467	99469	99470	Mrs. Kenwigs	310	‘ Which , unless I am very much mistaken , ’
99476	99502	99469	99470	Mrs. Kenwigs	310	‘ will not be very long ; for such clever children , Mr Noggs , never were born into this world , I do believe . ’
99503	99506	99508	99508	Newman	211	‘ There , ’
99510	99530	99508	99508	Newman	211	‘ that ’s all . It ’s beneath you , I know ; but I thought that perhaps you might-- ’
99531	99534	99536	99536	Nicholas	207	‘ Might ! ’
99542	99579	99536	99536	Nicholas	207	‘ of course I shall . I accept the offer at once . Tell the worthy mother so , without delay , my dear fellow ; and that I am ready to begin whenever she pleases . ’
100052	100061	100063	100064	Mrs. Kenwigs	310	‘ How do you do , Mr. Johnson ? ’
100066	100072	100063	100064	Mrs. Kenwigs	310	‘ Uncle -- Mr. Johnson . ’
100073	100081	100083	100084	Mr. Lillyvick	316	‘ How do you do , sir ? ’
100122	100136	100138	100139	Mrs. Kenwigs	310	‘ Mr. Johnson is engaged as private master to the children , uncle , ’
100141	100151	100153	100154	Mr. Lillyvick	316	‘ So you said just now , my dear , ’
100156	100161	100163	100164	Mrs. Kenwigs	310	‘ But I hope , ’
100170	100206	100163	100164	Mrs. Kenwigs	310	‘ that that will not make them proud ; but that they will bless their own good fortune , which has born them superior to common people ’s children . Do you hear , Morleena ? ’
100207	100212	100214	100215	Miss Kenwigs	314	‘ Yes , ma , ’
100217	100244	100246	100247	Mrs. Kenwigs	310	‘ And when you go out in the streets , or elsewhere , I desire that you do n’t boast of it to the other children , ’
100249	100301	100246	100247	Mrs. Kenwigs	310	‘ and that if you must say anything about it , you do n’t say no more than “ We ’ve got a private master comes to teach us at home , but we ai n’t proud , because ma says it ’s sinful . ” Do you hear , Morleena ? ’
100302	100307	100309	100310	Miss Kenwigs	314	‘ Yes , ma , ’
100313	100326	100328	100329	Mrs. Kenwigs	310	‘ Then mind you recollect , and do as I tell you , ’
100331	100339	100360	100361	the collector	10290	‘ Shall Mr. Johnson begin , uncle ? ’
100340	100358	100360	100361	the collector	10290	‘ I am ready to hear , if Mr. Johnson is ready to commence , my dear , ’
100371	100383	100360	100361	the collector	10290	‘ What sort of language do you consider French , sir ? ’
100384	100390	100392	100392	Nicholas	207	‘ How do you mean ? ’
100394	100405	100407	100408	the collector	10290	‘ Do you consider it a good language , sir ? ’
100410	100419	100407	100408	the collector	10290	‘ a pretty language , a sensible language ? ’
100420	100427	100429	100429	Nicholas	207	‘ A pretty language , certainly , ’
100431	100457	100407	100408	the collector	10290	‘ and as it has a name for everything , and admits of elegant conversation about everything , I presume it is a sensible one . ’
100458	100464	100466	100467	Mr. Lillyvick	316	‘ I do n’t know , ’
100471	100482	100466	100467	Mr. Lillyvick	316	‘ Do you call it a cheerful language , now ? ’
100483	100486	100488	100488	Nicholas	207	‘ Yes , ’
100490	100499	100488	100488	Nicholas	207	‘ I should say it was , certainly . ’
100500	100512	100514	100515	the collector	10290	‘ It ’s very much changed since my time , then , ’
100517	100521	100514	100515	the collector	10290	‘ very much . ’
100522	100532	100534	100534	Nicholas	207	‘ Was it a dismal one in your time ? ’
100543	100546	100548	100549	Mr. Lillyvick	316	‘ Very , ’
100557	100643	100548	100549	Mr. Lillyvick	316	‘ It ’s the war time that I speak of ; the last war . It may be a cheerful language . I should be sorry to contradict anybody ; but I can only say that I ’ve heard the French prisoners , who were natives , and ought to know how to speak it , talking in such a dismal manner , that it made one miserable to hear them . Ay , that I have , fifty times , sir -- fifty times ! ’
100694	100704	100686	100686	he	2721	‘ What ’s the water in French , sir ? ’
100705	100708	100710	100710	Nicholas	207	‘ L’EAU , ’
100712	100715	100717	100718	Mr. Lillyvick	316	‘ Ah ! ’
100725	100748	100721	100721	his	2721	‘ I thought as much . Lo , eh ? I do n’t think anything of that language -- nothing at all . ’
100749	100759	100761	100762	Mrs. Kenwigs	310	‘ I suppose the children may begin , uncle ? ’
100764	100775	100777	100778	the collector	10290	‘ Oh yes ; they may begin , my dear , ’
100782	100791	100777	100778	the collector	10290	‘ I have no wish to prevent them . ’
101204	101210	101212	101212	Kate	210	‘ Is Madame Mantalini in ? ’
101214	101224	101226	101227	the man	8927	‘ Not often out at this time , miss , ’
101246	101252	101254	101254	Kate	210	‘ Can I see her ? ’
101256	101259	101261	101262	the man	8927	‘ Eh ? ’
101283	101288	101261	101262	the man	8927	‘ Lord , no . ’
101289	101297	101299	101299	Kate	210	‘ I came by her own appointment , ’
101301	101313	101299	101299	Kate	210	‘ I am -- I am -- to be employed here . ’
101314	101326	101328	101329	the footman	10488	‘ Oh ! you should have rung the worker ’s bell , ’
101342	101358	101328	101329	the footman	10488	‘ Let me see , though , I forgot -- Miss Nickleby , is it ? ’
101359	101362	101364	101364	Kate	210	‘ Yes , ’
101366	101368	101299	101299	Kate	210	‘ You ’re
101376	101381	101382	101383	Madame Mantalini	290	’ said the man . ‘
101401	101491	101382	101383	Madame Mantalini	290	’ Cautioning her , in these terms , not to trip over a heterogeneous litter of pastry - cook ’s trays , lamps , waiters full of glasses , and piles of rout seats which were strewn about the hall , plainly bespeaking a late party on the previous night , the man led the way to the second story , and ushered Kate into a back - room , communicating by folding - doors with the apartment in which she had first seen the mistress of the establishment . ‘
101500	101505	101493	101493	you	210	’ said the man , ‘
101512	101630	101506	101506	I	0	’ Having made this promise with much affability , he retired and left Kate alone . There was not much to amuse in the room ; of which the most attractive feature was , a half - length portrait in oil , of Mr. Mantalini , whom the artist had depicted scratching his head in an easy manner , and thus displaying to advantage a diamond ring , the gift of Madame Mantalini before her marriage . There was , however , the sound of voices in conversation in the next room ; and as the conversation was loud and the partition thin , Kate could not help discovering that they belonged to Mr and Mrs. Mantalini . ‘
101645	101650	101651	101651	you	210	’ said Mr. Mantalini , ‘
101663	101680	101681	101681	I	0	’ And then , there was a sound as though Mr. Mantalini were sipping his coffee . ‘
101685	101693	101681	101681	I	0	’ returned Madame Mantalini , evidently pouting . ‘
101707	101712	101695	101695	you	210	’ said Mr. Mantalini . ‘
101717	101725	101713	101713	I	0	’ returned Madame , with a sob . ‘
101734	101743	101713	101713	I	0	’ said Mr. Mantalini , breaking an egg . ‘
101784	101785	101776	101782	a frightful , naughty , demd hobgoblin	2752	’ ‘
101799	101805	101786	101786	I	0	’ rejoined Madame , sulkily . ‘
101830	101844	101786	101786	I	0	’ retorted Mr. Mantalini , with his egg - spoon in his mouth . ‘
101852	101857	101786	101786	I	0	’ said Mrs. Mantalini . ‘
101869	101874	101786	101786	I	0	’ replied Mr. Mantalini ; ‘
101899	101900	101901	101901	You	0	’ ‘
101911	101932	101901	101901	You	0	’ said Madame Mantalini , apparently desirous to lead the conversation back to the point from which it had strayed . ‘
101940	101941	101942	101942	You	0	’ ‘
101945	101949	101942	101942	You	0	’ said Madame ; ‘

101977	101988	101991	101991	demmit	1965	’ cried Mantalini , in a sort of lazy rapture . ‘
101993	101994	101991	101991	demmit	1965	’ ‘
102001	102005	101996	101996	I	0	’ resumed Madame , ‘
102034	102035	102036	102036	She	2753	’ ‘
102049	102080	102081	102081	She	2753	’ said Mantalini ; who , by the altered sound of his voice , seemed to have moved his chair , and taken up his position nearer to his wife . ‘
102103	102104	102105	102106	Two countesses	2758	’ ‘
102108	102112	102105	102106	Two countesses	2758	’ interposed Madame . ‘
102119	102120	102113	102113	You	0	’ ‘
102123	102127	102113	102113	You	0	’ cried Mantalini . ‘
102141	102142	102113	102113	You	0	’ ‘
102149	102155	102147	102147	you	0	’ asked Madame , playfully . ‘
102161	102166	102159	102159	I	0	’ replied her husband . ‘
102205	102248	102188	102190	that little fascinator	2765	’ Mr. Mantalini did not finish the sentence , but he gave Madame Mantalini a very loud kiss , which Madame Mantalini returned ; after which , there seemed to be some more kissing mixed up with the progress of the breakfast . ‘
102260	102269	102188	102190	that little fascinator	2765	’ said Mantalini , when these endearments ceased . ‘
102277	102278	102273	102273	we	2768	’ ‘
102283	102287	102273	102273	we	2768	’ replied Madame . ‘
102294	102298	102288	102288	We	2768	’ said Mantalini ; ‘
102317	102318	102315	102315	demmit	1965	’ ‘
102328	102333	102319	102319	You	0	’ said Madame coaxingly . ‘
102339	102344	102319	102319	You	0	’ returned her husband , ‘
102371	102377	102384	102384	Madame	290	’ joy , for nothing . ’
102378	102382	102384	102384	Madame	290	‘ For nothing , ’
102386	102393	102384	102384	Madame	290	‘ I am glad of that . ’
102394	102399	102401	102401	Mantalini	289	‘ For actually nothing , ’
102403	102505	102401	102401	Mantalini	289	‘ A hundred guineas down will buy him ; mane , and crest , and legs , and tail , all of the demdest beauty . I will ride him in the park before the very chariots of the rejected countesses . The demd old dowager will faint with grief and rage ; the other two will say “ He is married , he has made away with himself , it is a demd thing , it is all up ! ” They will hate each other demnebly , and wish you dead and buried . Ha ! ha ! Demmit . ’
102564	102570	102572	102573	Madame Mantalini	290	‘ Dear me , child ! ’
102579	102585	102572	102573	Madame Mantalini	290	‘ How came you here ? ’
102586	102589	102591	102591	Mantalini	289	‘ Child ! ’
102596	102608	102591	102591	Mantalini	289	‘ How came -- eh!--oh -- demmit , how d’ye do ? ’
102609	102621	102623	102623	Kate	210	‘ I have been waiting , here some time , ma’am , ’
102629	102647	102626	102627	Madame Mantalini	290	‘ The servant must have forgotten to let you know that I was here , I think . ’
102648	102657	102659	102659	Madame	290	‘ You really must see to that man , ’
102666	102671	102659	102659	Madame	290	‘ He forgets everything . ’
102672	102694	102696	102697	her husband	630	‘ I will twist his demd nose off his countenance for leaving such a very pretty creature all alone by herself , ’
102699	102702	102704	102704	Madame	290	‘ Mantalini , ’
102706	102711	102704	102704	Madame	290	‘ you forget yourself . ’
102712	102730	102732	102732	Mantalini	289	‘ I do n’t forget you , my soul , and never shall , and never can , ’
103009	103015	103017	103018	Madame Mantalini	290	‘ Oh , Miss Knag , ’
103020	103032	103017	103018	Madame Mantalini	290	‘ this is the young person I spoke to you about . ’
103111	103147	103149	103150	Madame Mantalini	290	‘ I think that , for the present at all events , it will be better for Miss Nickleby to come into the show - room with you , and try things on for people , ’
103152	103175	103149	103150	Madame Mantalini	290	‘ She will not be able for the present to be of much use in any other way ; and her appearance will-- ’
103176	103186	103188	103189	Miss Knag	293	‘ Suit very well with mine , Madame Mantalini , ’
103191	103406	103188	103189	Miss Knag	293	‘ So it will ; and to be sure I might have known that you would not be long in finding that out ; for you have so much taste in all those matters , that really , as I often say to the young ladies , I do not know how , when , or where , you possibly could have acquired all you know -- hem -- Miss Nickleby and I are quite a pair , Madame Mantalini , only I am a little darker than Miss Nickleby , and -- hem -- I think my foot may be a little smaller . Miss Nickleby , I am sure , will not be offended at my saying that , when she hears that our family always have been celebrated for small feet ever since -- hem -- ever since our family had any feet at all , indeed , I think . I had an uncle once , Madame Mantalini , who lived in Cheltenham , and had a most excellent business as a tobacconist -- hem -- who had such small feet , that they were no bigger than those which are usually joined to wooden legs -- the most symmetrical feet , Madame Mantalini , that even you can imagine . ’
103407	103423	103425	103425	Madame	290	‘ They must have had something of the appearance of club feet , Miss Knag , ’

103442	103619	103439	103440	Miss Knag	293	‘ Ha ! ha ! ha ! Of club feet ! Oh very good ! As I often remark to the young ladies , “ Well I must say , and I do not care who knows it , of all the ready humour -- hem -- I ever heard anywhere”--and I have heard a good deal ; for when my dear brother was alive ( I kept house for him , Miss Nickleby ) , we had to supper once a week two or three young men , highly celebrated in those days for their humour , Madame Mantalini--“Of all the ready humour , ” I say to the young ladies , “ I ever heard , Madame Mantalini ’s is the most remarkable -- hem . It is so gentle , so sarcastic , and yet so good - natured ( as I was observing to Miss Simmonds only this morning ) , that how , or when , or by what means she acquired it , is to me a mystery indeed . ” ’
103685	103688	103666	103666	she	293	‘ hem ! ’
103818	103834	103836	103837	Madame Mantalini	290	‘ You ’ll take care that Miss Nickleby understands her hours , and so forth , ’
103839	103859	103836	103837	Madame Mantalini	290	‘ and so I ’ll leave her with you . You ’ll not forget my directions , Miss Knag ? ’
103897	103908	103910	103911	Miss Knag	293	‘ Charming creature , is n’t she , Miss Nickleby ? ’
103918	103927	103929	103929	Kate	210	‘ I have seen very little of her , ’
103931	103937	103929	103929	Kate	210	‘ I hardly know yet . ’
103938	103945	103947	103948	Miss Knag	293	‘ Have you seen Mr. Mantalini ? ’
103950	103959	103947	103948	Miss Knag	293	‘ Yes ; I have seen him twice . ’
103960	103968	103929	103929	Kate	210	‘ Is n’t HE a charming creature ? ’
103969	103984	103986	103986	Kate	210	‘ Indeed he does not strike me as being so , by any means , ’
103988	103994	103996	103997	Miss Knag	293	‘ No , my dear ! ’
104003	104045	103996	103997	Miss Knag	293	‘ Why , goodness gracious mercy , where ’s your taste ? Such a fine tall , full - whiskered dashing gentlemanly man , with such teeth and hair , and -- hem -- well now , you DO astonish me . ’
104046	104055	104057	104057	Kate	210	‘ I dare say I am very foolish , ’
104064	104099	104057	104057	Kate	210	‘ but as my opinion is of very little importance to him or anyone else , I do not regret having formed it , and shall be slow to change it , I think . ’
104100	104114	104116	104120	one of the young ladies	2798	‘ He is a very fine man , do n’t you think so ? ’
104122	104137	104139	104139	Kate	210	‘ Indeed he may be , for anything I could say to the contrary , ’
104141	104152	104154	104154	another	2800	‘ And drives very beautiful horses , does n’t he ? ’
104156	104169	104171	104171	Kate	210	‘ I dare say he may , but I never saw them , ’
104173	104178	104180	104181	Miss Knag	293	‘ Never saw them ! ’
104183	104221	104180	104181	Miss Knag	293	‘ Oh , well ! There it is at once you know ; how can you possibly pronounce an opinion about a gentleman -- hem -- if you do n’t see him as he turns out altogether ? ’
104335	104340	104342	104342	Kate	210	‘ I do indeed , ’

104507	104524	104504	104505	her companion	1906	‘ I did not think of it . You are in mourning for some near relation ? ’
104525	104530	104532	104532	Kate	210	‘ For my father , ’
104534	104542	104544	104545	Miss Knag	293	‘ For what relation , Miss Simmonds ? ’
104552	104556	104558	104559	the other	8439	‘ Her father , ’
104562	104568	104570	104571	Miss Knag	293	‘ Her father , eh ? ’

104621	104640	104616	104616	Kate	210	‘ or I might perhaps , at a time like this , be enabled to support it better . ’

105299	105462	105296	105297	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ I ’ve been thinking all day what a delightful thing it would be for Madame Mantalini to take you into partnership -- such a likely thing too , you know ! Why , your poor dear papa ’s cousin ’s sister - in - law -- a Miss Browndock -- was taken into partnership by a lady that kept a school at Hammersmith , and made her fortune in no time at all . I forget , by - the - bye , whether that Miss Browndock was the same lady that got the ten thousand pounds prize in the lottery , but I think she was ; indeed , now I come to think of it , I am sure she was . “ Mantalini and Nickleby ” , how well it would sound!--and if Nicholas has any good fortune , you might have Doctor Nickleby , the head - master of Westminster School , living in the same street . ’
105463	105467	105469	105469	Kate	210	‘ Dear Nicholas ! ’
105483	105532	105469	105469	Kate	210	‘ In all our misfortunes , how happy it makes me , mama , to hear he is doing well , and to find him writing in such good spirits ! It consoles me for all we may undergo , to think that he is comfortable and happy . ’
105968	105978	105980	105981	Miss Knag	293	‘ Well , now , indeed , Madame Mantalini , ’
105999	106095	105980	105981	Miss Knag	293	‘ that Miss Nickleby is a very creditable young person -- a very creditable young person indeed -- hem -- upon my word , Madame Mantalini , it does very extraordinary credit even to your discrimination that you should have found such a very excellent , very well - behaved , very -- hem -- very unassuming young woman to assist in the fitting on . I have seen some young women when they had the opportunity of displaying before their betters , behave in such a -- oh , dear -- well -- but you ’re

106182	106187	106162	106162	I	0	’ said Miss Knag ; ‘
106201	106202	106189	106189	you	9456	’ ‘
106206	106210	106204	106204	youth	8754	’ inquired Madame . ‘
106222	106229	106213	106213	I	0	’ replied Miss Knag , reddening ; ‘
106241	106242	106270	106271	Madame Mantalini	290	’ ‘
106255	106259	106252	106252	I	0	’ suggested Madame . ‘
106273	106280	106270	106271	Madame Mantalini	290	’ rejoined Miss Knag most complacently , ‘
106319	106320	106322	106322	myself	0	’ ‘
106324	106344	106322	106322	myself	0	’ observed Madame Mantalini , glancing with affected carelessness at her assistant , and laughing heartily in her sleeve , ‘
106360	106361	106347	106348	Miss Nickleby	226	’ ‘
106366	106371	106347	106348	Miss Nickleby	226	’ said Miss Knag , ‘
106419	106420	106405	106406	the man	8927	’ ‘
106431	106436	106439	106439	her	226	’ remarked Madame Mantalini . ‘
106451	106452	106439	106439	her	226	’ ‘
106455	106465	106439	106439	her	226	’ cried Miss Knag with a countenance beaming delight ; ‘
106526	106596	106622	106622	her	226	’ In fact , Miss Knag had conceived an incipient affection for Kate Nickleby , after witnessing her failure that morning , and this short conversation with her superior increased the favourable prepossession to a most surprising extent ; which was the more remarkable , as when she first scanned that young lady ’s face and figure , she had entertained certain inward misgivings that they would never agree . ‘
106600	106619	106620	106620	I	0	’ said Miss Knag , glancing at the reflection of herself in a mirror at no great distance , ‘
106634	106809	106629	106629	I	0	’ Of such a highly disinterested quality was this devoted friendship , and so superior was it to the little weaknesses of flattery or ill - nature , that the kind - hearted Miss Knag candidly informed Kate Nickleby , next day , that she saw she would never do for the business , but that she need not give herself the slightest uneasiness on this account , for that she ( Miss Knag ) , by increased exertions on her own part , would keep her as much as possible in the background , and that all she would have to do , would be to remain perfectly quiet before company , and to shrink from attracting notice by every means in her power . This last suggestion was so much in accordance with the timid girl ’s own feelings and wishes , that she readily promised implicit reliance on the excellent spinster ’s advice : without questioning , or indeed bestowing a moment ’s reflection upon , the motives that dictated it . ‘
106827	106832	106824	106824	my	0	’ said Miss Knag ; ‘
106850	106921	106923	106923	you	2868	’ Undoubtedly it was singular , that if Miss Knag did feel a strong interest in Kate Nickleby , it should not rather have been the interest of a maiden aunt or grandmother ; that being the conclusion to which the difference in their respective ages would have naturally tended . But Miss Knag wore clothes of a very youthful pattern , and perhaps her feelings took the same shape . ‘
106925	106945	106923	106923	you	2868	’ said Miss Knag , bestowing a kiss upon Kate at the conclusion of the second day ’s work , ‘
106955	106956	106957	106957	I	0	’ ‘
106982	106986	106959	106959	your	2868	’ sighed Kate . ‘
106996	107010	106991	106991	I	0	’ rejoined Miss Knag , in a most uncommon flow of good humour . ‘
107044	107045	107038	107038	you	2868	’ ‘
107050	107054	107038	107038	you	2868	’ replied Kate . ‘
107058	107077	107038	107038	you	2868	’ cried Miss Knag , regarding herself with great favour in the glass as she tied her bonnet . ‘
107091	107092	107084	107084	you	2868	’ ‘
107104	107111	107084	107084	you	2868	’ asked Kate , half smiling . ‘
107138	107143	107120	107122	any young woman	2877	’ replied Miss Knag . ‘
107152	107168	107146	107146	I	0	’ answered Kate , correcting herself hastily , for she was afraid of appearing proud , ‘
107175	107176	107146	107146	I	0	’ ‘
107190	107224	107146	107146	I	0	’ rejoined Miss Knag with that sort of half - sigh , which , accompanied by two or three slight nods of the head , is pity ’s small change in general society ; ‘
107259	107306	107248	107248	he	8657	‘ em to sleep in . These sort of people , I tell him , are glad to sleep anywhere ! Heaven suits the back to the burden . What a nice thing it is to think that it should be so , is n’t it ? ’
107307	107310	107312	107312	Kate	210	‘ Very , ’
107314	107328	107330	107331	Miss Knag	293	‘ I ’ll walk with you part of the way , my dear , ’
107333	107379	107330	107331	Miss Knag	293	‘ for you must go very near our house ; and as it ’s quite dark , and our last servant went to the hospital a week ago , with St Anthony ’s fire in her face , I shall be glad of your company . ’
107435	107439	107441	107441	Kate	210	‘ I fear , ’
107445	107460	107441	107441	Kate	210	‘ that mama -- my mother , I mean -- is waiting for me . ’
107461	107473	107475	107476	Miss Knag	293	‘ You need n’t make the least apology , my dear , ’
107484	107510	107475	107476	Miss Knag	293	‘ I dare say she is a very respectable old person , and I shall be quite -- hem -- quite pleased to know her . ’
107589	107608	107610	107611	Miss Knag	293	‘ I have taken such a fancy to your daughter , Mrs. Nickleby , you ca n’t think , ’
107624	107632	107634	107635	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ I am delighted to hear it , ’
107637	107653	107634	107635	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ though it is nothing new to me , that even strangers should like Kate . ’
107654	107657	107659	107660	Miss Knag	293	‘ Hem ! ’
107662	107676	107678	107679	Mrs Nickleby	207	‘ You will like her better when you know how good she is , ’
107681	107738	107678	107679	Mrs Nickleby	207	‘ It is a great blessing to me , in my misfortunes , to have a child , who knows neither pride nor vanity , and whose bringing - up might very well have excused a little of both at first . You do n’t know what it is to lose a husband , Miss Knag . ’
107784	107792	107777	107777	she	293	‘ No , indeed I do n’t , ’
107822	107837	107839	107840	Mrs Nickleby	207	‘ Kate has improved even in this little time , I have no doubt , ’
107848	107854	107856	107857	Miss Knag	293	‘ Oh ! of course , ’
107859	107866	107868	107869	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ And will improve still more , ’
107871	107881	107883	107884	Miss Knag	293	‘ That she will , I ’ll be bound , ’
107899	107905	107907	107909	poor Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ She always was clever , ’
107914	108125	107907	107909	poor Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ always , from a baby . I recollect when she was only two years and a half old , that a gentleman who used to visit very much at our house -- Mr Watkins , you know , Kate , my dear , that your poor papa went bail for , who afterwards ran away to the United States , and sent us a pair of snow shoes , with such an affectionate letter that it made your poor dear father cry for a week . You remember the letter ? In which he said that he was very sorry he could n’t repay the fifty pounds just then , because his capital was all out at interest , and he was very busy making his fortune , but that he did n’t forget you were his god - daughter , and he should take it very unkind if we did n’t buy you a silver coral and put it down to his old account ? Dear me , yes , my dear , how stupid you are ! and spoke so affectionately of the old port wine that he used to drink a bottle and a half of every time he came . You must remember , Kate ? ’
108126	108137	108353	108354	Miss Knag	293	‘ Yes , yes , mama ; what of him ? ’
108138	108148	108150	108151	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ Why , that Mr. Watkins , my dear , ’
108169	108331	108156	108156	she	207	‘ that Mr. Watkins -- he was n’t any relation , Miss Knag will understand , to the Watkins who kept the Old Boar in the village ; by - the - bye , I do n’t remember whether it was the Old Boar or the George the Third , but it was one of the two , I know , and it ’s much the same -- that Mr. Watkins said , when you were only two years and a half old , that you were one of the most astonishing children he ever saw . He did indeed , Miss Knag , and he was n’t at all fond of children , and could n’t have had the slightest motive for doing it . I know it was he who said so , because I recollect , as well as if it was only yesterday , his borrowing twenty pounds of her poor dear papa the very moment afterwards . ’
108382	108393	108395	108396	Miss Knag	293	‘ Do n’t talk of lending money , Mrs. Nickleby , ’
108398	108554	108395	108396	Miss Knag	293	‘ or you ’ll drive me crazy , perfectly crazy . My mama -- hem -- was the most lovely and beautiful creature , with the most striking and exquisite -- hem -- the most exquisite nose that ever was put upon a human face , I do believe , Mrs Nickleby ( here Miss Knag rubbed her own nose sympathetically ) ; the most delightful and accomplished woman , perhaps , that ever was seen ; but she had that one failing of lending money , and carried it to such an extent that she lent -- hem -- oh ! thousands of pounds , all our little fortunes , and what ’s more , Mrs. Nickleby , I do n’t think , if we were to live till -- till -- hem -- till the very end of time , that we should ever get them back again . I do n’t indeed . ’
108799	108807	108809	108810	Miss Knag	293	‘ Do n’t go away , Mortimer , ’
108817	108835	108809	108810	Miss Knag	293	‘ It ’s only one of our young ladies and her mother . Mrs. and Miss Nickleby . ’

109254	109265	109267	109268	the substitute	2909	‘ No there is not , indeed , Miss Knag , ’
109270	109283	109267	109268	the substitute	2909	‘ and so I wo n’t tell you no stories about it . ’
109284	109291	109293	109294	Miss Knag	293	‘ Then why is n’t there ? ’
109296	109334	109336	109337	Mrs. Blockson	353	‘ Because there arn’t no coals left out , and if I could make coals I would , but as I ca n’t I wo n’t , and so I make bold to tell you , Mem , ’
109339	109348	109350	109352	Mr. Mortimer Knag	352	‘ Will you hold your tongue -- female ? ’
109360	109368	109370	109371	the charwoman	2908	‘ By your leave , Mr. Knag , ’

109395	109421	109429	109430	Mr. Knag	352	’m spoke to , sir ; and with regard to being a female , sir , I should wish to know what you considered yourself ? ’
109422	109427	109429	109430	Mr. Knag	352	‘ A miserable wretch , ’
109436	109441	109429	109430	Mr. Knag	352	‘ A miserable wretch . ’

109532	109568	109509	109509	you	352	’ With these parting words , the good woman quitted the room with great ease of manner , leaving the door wide open ; Mr. Knag , at the same moment , flung himself into the ‘
109571	109576	109509	109509	you	352	’ and groaned aloud . ‘
109587	109598	109582	109583	that gentleman	8945	’ inquired Mrs. Nickleby , greatly disturbed by the sound . ‘
109603	109610	109582	109583	that gentleman	8945	’ inquired Kate , really alarmed . ‘
109613	109618	109582	109583	that gentleman	8945	’ replied Miss Knag ; ‘
109638	109639	109635	109636	Madame Mantalini	290	’ ‘
109643	109648	109635	109636	Madame Mantalini	290	’ exclaimed Mrs. Nickleby . ‘
109651	109656	109635	109636	Madame Mantalini	290	’ continued Miss Knag , ‘
109826	109827	109813	109813	he	8945	’ ‘
109831	109847	109813	109813	he	8945	’ repeated Kate , finding that a pause was left for somebody to say something . ‘
109850	109860	109813	109813	he	8945	’ said Miss Knag , nodding in great triumph ; ‘
110019	110170	110171	110171	Mantalini	290	’ How much more communicative Miss Knag might have become under more favourable circumstances , it is impossible to divine , but as the gloomy one was within ear - shot , and the fire wanted making up , her disclosures stopped here . To judge from all appearances , and the difficulty of making the water warm , the last servant could not have been much accustomed to any other fire than St Anthony ’s ; but a little brandy and water was made at last , and the guests , having been previously regaled with cold leg of mutton and bread and cheese , soon afterwards took leave ; Kate amusing herself , all the way home , with the recollection of her last glimpse of Mr. Mortimer Knag deeply abstracted in the shop ; and Mrs. Nickleby by debating within herself whether the dressmaking firm would ultimately become ‘
110177	110180	110181	110181	Mantalini	290	’ , or ‘
110187	110381	110183	110183	Nickleby	210	’ . At this high point , Miss Knag ’s friendship remained for three whole days , much to the wonderment of Madame Mantalini ’s young ladies who had never beheld such constancy in that quarter , before ; but on the fourth , it received a check no less violent than sudden , which thus occurred . It happened that an old lord of great family , who was going to marry a young lady of no family in particular , came with the young lady , and the young lady ’s sister , to witness the ceremony of trying on two nuptial bonnets which had been ordered the day before , and Madame Mantalini announcing the fact , in a shrill treble , through the speaking - pipe , which communicated with the workroom , Miss Knag darted hastily upstairs with a bonnet in each hand , and presented herself in the show - room , in a charming state of palpitation , intended to demonstrate her enthusiasm in the cause . The bonnets were no sooner fairly on , than Miss Knag and Madame Mantalini fell into convulsions of admiration . ‘
110387	110392	110183	110183	Nickleby	210	’ said Madame Mantalini . ‘
110404	110570	110648	110649	Madame Mantalini	290	’ said Miss Knag . Now , the old lord , who was a VERY old lord , said nothing , but mumbled and chuckled in a state of great delight , no less with the nuptial bonnets and their wearers , than with his own address in getting such a fine woman for his wife ; and the young lady , who was a very lively young lady , seeing the old lord in this rapturous condition , chased the old lord behind a cheval - glass , and then and there kissed him , while Madame Mantalini and the other young lady looked , discreetly , another way . But , pending the salutation , Miss Knag , who was tinged with curiosity , stepped accidentally behind the glass , and encountered the lively young lady ’s eye just at the very moment when she kissed the old lord ; upon which the young lady , in a pouting manner , murmured something about ‘
110575	110577	110648	110649	Madame Mantalini	290	’ and ‘
110581	110598	110648	110649	Madame Mantalini	290	’ and finished by darting a look of displeasure at Miss Knag , and smiling contemptuously . ‘
110602	110608	110599	110600	Madame Mantalini	290	’ said the young lady . ‘
110611	110616	110617	110617	Pray	2925	’ said Madame Mantalini . ‘
110628	110629	110617	110617	Pray	2925	’ ‘
110635	110640	110617	110617	Pray	2925	’ said the sister . ‘
110651	110665	110648	110649	Madame Mantalini	290	’ said the lord ’s intended , throwing herself languidly on a sofa , ‘
110692	110693	110681	110683	that young creature	2930	’ ‘
110698	110704	110705	110708	the lovely young creature	2931	’ said the old lord ; ‘
110714	110715	110716	110716	Everybody	865	’ ‘
110722	110734	110716	110716	Everybody	865	’ said the young lady , in the same careless manner ; ‘
110751	110752	110753	110753	She	2930	’ ‘
110758	110763	110753	110753	She	2930	’ replied Madame Mantalini . ‘
110777	110778	110772	110772	You	293	’ ‘
110793	110800	110789	110789	you	293	’ asked Miss Knag , trembling . ‘
110806	110867	110801	110801	You	293	’ repeated the superior , sharply . Miss Knag vanished without another word , and in all reasonable time was replaced by Kate , who took off the new bonnets and put on the old ones : blushing very much to find that the old lord and the two young ladies were staring her out of countenance all the time . ‘
110876	110884	110871	110871	you	293	’ said the lord ’s chosen bride . ‘
110905	110914	110885	110885	She	2936	’ interposed Madame Mantalini with a gracious smile . ‘
110932	110937	110918	110918	you	293	’ said the intended . ‘
110944	110950	110955	110955	I	0	’ replied the old lord , ‘
110956	110988	110955	110955	I	0	’m going to be married , and lead a new life . Ha , ha , ha ! a new life , a new life ! ha , ha , ha ! ’
111062	111080	111082	111083	Madame Mantalini	290	‘ I hope you do n’t think good looks a disqualification for the business , my lord , ’
111087	111093	111095	111097	the old lord	10805	‘ Not by any means , ’
111099	111109	111095	111097	the old lord	10805	‘ or you would have left it long ago . ’
111110	111115	111117	111119	the lively lady	2942	‘ You naughty creature , ’
111128	111141	111117	111119	the lively lady	2942	‘ I wo n’t have you talk so . How dare you ? ’
111189	111203	111205	111206	the lady	8485	‘ You will see that those little alterations are made , Madame Mantalini , ’
111208	111263	111205	111206	the lady	8485	‘ Nay , you bad man , you positively shall go first ; I would n’t leave you behind with that pretty girl , not for half a second . I know you too well . Jane , my dear , let him go first , and we shall be quite sure of him . ’
111317	111320	111322	111323	Madame Mantalini	290	‘ Foh ! ’
111325	111358	111322	111323	Madame Mantalini	290	‘ how he ever gets into a carriage without thinking of a hearse , I ca n’t think . There , take the things away , my dear , take them away . ’
111512	111516	111518	111518	Kate	210	‘ Bless me ! ’
111524	111530	111518	111518	Kate	210	‘ what is the matter ? ’
111564	111568	111544	111546	several young ladies	2958	‘ a shame . ’
111569	111575	111577	111577	Kate	210	‘ What is a shame ? ’
111579	111592	111577	111577	Kate	210	‘ What is the matter ? What has happened ? tell me . ’
111593	111596	111598	111599	Miss Knag	293	‘ Matter ! ’
111619	111630	111577	111577	Kate	210	‘ matter ! Fie upon you , you nasty creature ! ’
111631	111634	111636	111636	Kate	210	‘ Gracious ! ’
111659	111665	111577	111577	Kate	210	‘ have I offended you ? ’
111666	111671	111673	111674	Miss Knag	293	‘ YOU offended me ! ’
111676	111697	111673	111674	Miss Knag	293	‘ YOU ! a chit , a child , an upstart nobody ! Oh , indeed ! Ha , ha ! ’
111772	111777	111779	111780	Miss Knag	293	‘ Here she is , ’
111802	111831	111779	111780	Miss Knag	293	‘ here she is -- everybody is talking about her -- the belle , ladies -- the beauty , the -- oh , you bold - faced thing ! ’
111869	111874	111876	111877	Miss Knag	293	‘ For fifteen years , ’
111886	111908	111910	111911	Miss Knag	293	‘ for fifteen years have I been the credit and ornament of this room and the one upstairs . Thank God , ’
111926	111983	111910	111911	Miss Knag	293	‘ I have never in all that time , till now , been exposed to the arts , the vile arts , of a creature , who disgraces us with all her proceedings , and makes proper people blush for themselves . But I feel it , I do feel it , although I am disgusted . ’
112064	112077	112079	112080	Miss Knag	293	‘ Have I lived to this day to be called a fright ! ’
112096	112102	112104	112105	the chorus	2966	‘ Oh no , no , ’
112107	112118	112104	112105	the chorus	2966	‘ pray do n’t say so ; do n’t now ! ’
112119	112130	112132	112133	Miss Knag	293	‘ Have I deserved to be called an elderly person ? ’
112140	112150	112152	112153	the chorus	2966	‘ Do n’t think of such things , dear , ’
112155	112160	112162	112163	Miss Knag	293	‘ I hate her , ’
112165	112204	112162	112163	Miss Knag	293	‘ I detest and hate her . Never let her speak to me again ; never let anybody who is a friend of mine speak to her ; a slut , a hussy , an impudent artful hussy ! ’

When she joined her mother , as usual , at the street corner , she was not a little surprised to find her in conversation with Mr. Ralph Nickleby ; but her surprise was soon redoubled , no less by the matter of their conversation , than by the smoothed and altered manner of Mr. Nickleby himself . ‘
112613	112617	112499	112499	She	210	’ said Ralph ; ‘
112627	112628	112618	112618	we	2980	’ ‘
112631	112651	112618	112618	we	2980	’ replied Kate , shrinking , though she scarce knew why , from her uncle ’s cold glistening eye . ‘
112655	112659	112618	112618	we	2980	’ said Ralph . ‘
112697	112698	112678	112679	your mother	935	’ ‘
112707	112724	112678	112679	your mother	935	’ interposed Mrs. Nickleby , quite insensible to the sarcastic tone of Ralph ’s last remark . ‘
112747	112761	112746	112746	you	702	’re to dine with your uncle at half - past six o’clock tomorrow . ’
112813	112818	112820	112822	the good lady	8773	‘ Let me see , ’
112824	112864	112866	112867	Mrs Nickleby	207	‘ Your black silk frock will be quite dress enough , my dear , with that pretty little scarf , and a plain band in your hair , and a pair of black silk stock -- Dear , dear , ’
112875	112929	112866	112867	Mrs Nickleby	207	‘ if I had but those unfortunate amethysts of mine -- you recollect them , Kate , my love -- how they used to sparkle , you know -- but your papa , your poor dear papa -- ah ! there never was anything so cruelly sacrificed as those jewels were , never ! ’
112965	112969	112961	112961	mama	9827	’ said Kate . ‘
112977	112978	112972	112972	you	9827	’ ‘
112986	112993	112981	112981	Kate	210	’ rejoined Mrs. Nickleby , pettishly , ‘
113140	113141	113146	113146	mama	9827	’ ‘
113150	113208	113146	113146	mama	9827	’ replied Kate . And to do Mrs. Nickleby justice , she never had lost -- and to do married ladies as a body justice , they seldom do lose -- any occasion of inculcating similar golden percepts , whose only blemish is , the slight degree of vagueness and uncertainty in which they are usually enveloped . ‘
113211	113220	113146	113146	mama	9827	’ said Mrs. Nickleby , with great fervour , ‘
113246	113306	113146	113146	mama	9827	’ When she had arrived at this reflection , Mrs. Nickleby sighed , rubbed her hands , cast up her eyes , and finally assumed a look of meek composure ; thus importing that she was a persecuted saint , but that she would n’t trouble her hearers by mentioning a circumstance which must be so obvious to everybody . ‘
113309	113422	113146	113146	mama	9827	’ said Ralph , with a smile , which , in common with all other tokens of emotion , seemed to skulk under his face , rather than play boldly over it--‘to return to the point from which we have strayed . I have a little party of -- of -- gentlemen with whom I am connected in business just now , at my house tomorrow ; and your mother has promised that you shall keep house for me . I am not much used to parties ; but this is one of business , and such fooleries are an important part of it sometimes . You do n’t mind obliging me ? ’
113423	113426	113428	113429	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ Mind ! ’
113431	113437	113428	113429	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ My dear Kate , why-- ’
113438	113441	113443	113443	Ralph	208	‘ Pray , ’
113451	113458	113443	113443	Ralph	208	‘ I spoke to my niece . ’
113459	113471	113473	113473	Kate	210	‘ I shall be very glad , of course , uncle , ’
113475	113488	113473	113473	Kate	210	‘ but I am afraid you will find me awkward and embarrassed . ’
113489	113493	113495	113495	Ralph	208	‘ Oh no , ’
113497	113525	113495	113495	Ralph	208	‘ come when you like , in a hackney coach -- I’ll pay for it . Good - night -- a -- a -- God bless you . ’
113585	113596	113598	113599	Mrs Nickleby	207	‘ What a very strongly marked countenance your uncle has ! ’
113608	113621	113598	113599	Mrs Nickleby	207	‘ I do n’t see the slightest resemblance to his poor brother . ’
113622	113625	113627	113627	Kate	210	‘ Mama ! ’
113630	113638	113627	113627	Kate	210	‘ To think of such a thing ! ’
113639	113642	113644	113645	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ No , ’
113649	113663	113644	113645	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ There certainly is none . But it ’s a very honest face . ’
113720	113736	113738	113739	Mrs Nickleby	207	‘ What has come over you , my dear , in the name of goodness ? ’
113754	113762	113764	113764	Kate	210	‘ I was only thinking , mama , ’
113766	113769	113771	113772	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ Thinking ! ’
113774	113827	113771	113772	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ Ay , and indeed plenty to think about , too . Your uncle has taken a strong fancy to you , that ’s quite clear ; and if some extraordinary good fortune does n’t come to you , after this , I shall be a little surprised , that ’s all . ’
113872	114942	114943	114943	I	0	’ houses , and married them , after short but ardent courtships ; and Kate , listening first in apathy , and afterwards in amusement , felt , as they walked home , something of her mother ’s sanguine complexion gradually awakening in her own bosom , and began to think that her prospects might be brightening , and that better days might be dawning upon them . Such is hope , Heaven ’s own gift to struggling mortals ; pervading , like some subtle essence from the skies , all things , both good and bad ; as universal as death , and more infectious than disease ! The feeble winter ’s sun -- and winter ’s suns in the city are very feeble indeed -- might have brightened up , as he shone through the dim windows of the large old house , on witnessing the unusual sight which one half - furnished room displayed . In a gloomy corner , where , for years , had stood a silent dusty pile of merchandise , sheltering its colony of mice , and frowning , a dull and lifeless mass , upon the panelled room , save when , responding to the roll of heavy waggons in the street without , it quaked with sturdy tremblings and caused the bright eyes of its tiny citizens to grow brighter still with fear , and struck them motionless , with attentive ear and palpitating heart , until the alarm had passed away -- in this dark corner , was arranged , with scrupulous care , all Kate ’s little finery for the day ; each article of dress partaking of that indescribable air of jauntiness and individuality which empty garments -- whether by association , or that they become moulded , as it were , to the owner ’s form -- will take , in eyes accustomed to , or picturing , the wearer ’s smartness . In place of a bale of musty goods , there lay the black silk dress : the neatest possible figure in itself . The small shoes , with toes delicately turned out , stood upon the very pressure of some old iron weight ; and a pile of harsh discoloured leather had unconsciously given place to the very same little pair of black silk stockings , which had been the objects of Mrs. Nickleby ’s peculiar care . Rats and mice , and such small gear , had long ago been starved , or had emigrated to better quarters : and , in their stead , appeared gloves , bands , scarfs , hair - pins , and many other little devices , almost as ingenious in their way as rats and mice themselves , for the tantalisation of mankind . About and among them all , moved Kate herself , not the least beautiful or unwonted relief to the stern , old , gloomy building . In good time , or in bad time , as the reader likes to take it -- for Mrs Nickleby ’s impatience went a great deal faster than the clocks at that end of the town , and Kate was dressed to the very last hair - pin a full hour and a half before it was at all necessary to begin to think about it -- in good time , or in bad time , the toilet was completed ; and it being at length the hour agreed upon for starting , the milkman fetched a coach from the nearest stand , and Kate , with many adieux to her mother , and many kind messages to Miss La Creevy , who was to come to tea , seated herself in it , and went away in state , if ever anybody went away in state in a hackney coach yet . And the coach , and the coachman , and the horses , rattled , and jangled , and whipped , and cursed , and swore , and tumbled on together , until they came to Golden Square . The coachman gave a tremendous double knock at the door , which was opened long before he had done , as quickly as if there had been a man behind it , with his hand tied to the latch . Kate , who had expected no more uncommon appearance than Newman Noggs in a clean shirt , was not a little astonished to see that the opener was a man in handsome livery , and that there were two or three others in the hall . There was no doubt about its being the right house , however , for there was the name upon the door ; so she accepted the laced coat - sleeve which was tendered her , and entering the house , was ushered upstairs , into a back drawing - room , where she was left alone . If she had been surprised at the apparition of the footman , she was perfectly absorbed in amazement at the richness and splendour of the furniture . The softest and most elegant carpets , the most exquisite pictures , the costliest mirrors ; articles of richest ornament , quite dazzling from their beauty and perplexing from the prodigality with which they were scattered around ; encountered her on every side . The very staircase nearly down to the hall - door , was crammed with beautiful and luxurious things , as though the house were brimful of riches , which , with a very trifling addition , would fairly run over into the street . Presently , she heard a series of loud double knocks at the street - door , and after every knock some new voice in the next room ; the tones of Mr Ralph Nickleby were easily distinguishable at first , but by degrees they merged into the general buzz of conversation , and all she could ascertain was , that there were several gentlemen with no very musical voices , who talked very loud , laughed very heartily , and swore more than she would have thought quite necessary . But this was a question of taste . At length , the door opened , and Ralph himself , divested of his boots , and ceremoniously embellished with black silks and shoes , presented his crafty face . ‘
114953	114974	114943	114943	I	0	’ he said , in a low tone , and pointing , as he spoke , to the next room . ‘

115275	115278	115280	115281	the gentleman	8574	‘ Eh ! ’
115283	115290	115280	115281	the gentleman	8574	‘ What -- the -- deyvle ! ’
115313	115320	115322	115322	Ralph	208	‘ My niece , my lord , ’
115324	115344	115346	115347	his lordship	3016	‘ Then my ears did not deceive me , and it ’s not wa - a - x work , ’
115349	115355	115346	115347	his lordship	3016	‘ How de do ? I ’m
115359	115398	115346	115347	his lordship	3016	’ And then his lordship turned to another superlative gentleman , something older , something stouter , something redder in the face , and something longer upon town , and said in a loud whisper that the girl was ‘
115402	115403	115346	115347	his lordship	3016	’ ‘
115409	115432	115407	115407	Nickleby	226	’ said this second gentleman , who was lounging with his back to the fire , and both elbows on the chimneypiece . ‘
115437	115441	115433	115435	Sir Mulberry Hawk	358	’ said Ralph . ‘
115456	115462	115453	115454	Miss Nickleby	226	’ said Lord Frederick Verisopht . ‘
115471	115495	115469	115469	Nickleby	226	’ cried a sharp - faced gentleman , who was sitting on a low chair with a high back , reading the paper . ‘
115499	115503	115496	115497	Mr. Pyke	359	’ said Ralph . ‘
115509	115530	115507	115507	Nickleby	226	’ cried a gentleman with a flushed face and a flash air , from the elbow of Sir Mulberry Hawk . ‘
115534	115818	115531	115532	Mr. Pluck	360	’ said Ralph . Then wheeling about again , towards a gentleman with the neck of a stork and the legs of no animal in particular , Ralph introduced him as the Honourable Mr. Snobb ; and a white - headed person at the table as Colonel Chowser . The colonel was in conversation with somebody , who appeared to be a make - weight , and was not introduced at all . There were two circumstances which , in this early stage of the party , struck home to Kate ’s bosom , and brought the blood tingling to her face . One was the flippant contempt with which the guests evidently regarded her uncle , and the other , the easy insolence of their manner towards herself . That the first symptom was very likely to lead to the aggravation of the second , it needed no great penetration to foresee . And here Mr. Ralph Nickleby had reckoned without his host ; for however fresh from the country a young lady ( by nature ) may be , and however unacquainted with conventional behaviour , the chances are , that she will have quite as strong an innate sense of the decencies and proprieties of life as if she had run the gauntlet of a dozen London seasons -- possibly a stronger one , for such senses have been known to blunt in this improving process . When Ralph had completed the ceremonial of introduction , he led his blushing niece to a seat . As he did so , he glanced warily round as though to assure himself of the impression which her unlooked - for appearance had created . ‘
115825	115867	115823	115823	Nickleby	226	’ said Lord Frederick Verisopht , taking his glass out of his right eye , where it had , until now , done duty on Kate , and fixing it in his left , to bring it to bear on Ralph . ‘
115876	115881	115873	115874	Lord Frederick	229	’ said Mr. Pluck . ‘
115887	115892	115873	115874	Lord Frederick	229	’ said his lordship , ‘
115911	115912	115913	115913	Nickleby	226	’ ‘
115915	115927	115913	115913	Nickleby	226	’ said Sir Mulberry Hawk , in a thick coarse voice , ‘
115957	116053	116059	116059	Verisopht	229	’ Sir Mulberry garnished this speech with a hoarse laugh , and terminated it with a pleasant oath regarding Mr. Nickleby ’s limbs , whereat Messrs Pyke and Pluck laughed consumedly . These gentlemen had not yet quite recovered the jest , when dinner was announced , and then they were thrown into fresh ecstasies by a similar cause ; for Sir Mulberry Hawk , in an excess of humour , shot dexterously past Lord Frederick Verisopht who was about to lead Kate downstairs , and drew her arm through his up to the elbow . ‘
116061	116066	116059	116059	Verisopht	229	’ said Sir Mulberry , ‘
116088	116089	116077	116077	I	0	’ ‘
116096	116103	116077	116077	I	0	’ laughed the honourable Mr. Snobb , ‘
116110	116192	116077	116077	I	0	’ Rendered additionally witty by this applause , Sir Mulberry Hawk leered upon his friends most facetiously , and led Kate downstairs with an air of familiarity , which roused in her gentle breast such burning indignation , as she felt it almost impossible to repress . Nor was the intensity of these feelings at all diminished , when she found herself placed at the top of the table , with Sir Mulberry Hawk and Lord Frederick Verisopht on either side . ‘
116207	116217	116205	116205	you	3018	’ said Sir Mulberry as his lordship sat down . ‘
116221	116233	116236	116236	you	3018	’ replied Lord Frederick , fixing his eyes on Miss Nickleby , ‘
116242	116243	116236	116236	you	3018	’ ‘
116252	116257	116246	116246	you	3018	’ said Sir Mulberry , ‘
116279	116280	116275	116275	I	0	’ ‘
116290	116295	116283	116283	you	3018	’ said Lord Frederick . ‘
116304	116324	116325	116326	This fellow	3021	’ demanded Ralph from the bottom of the table , where he was supported by Messrs Pyke and Pluck . ‘
116335	116340	116325	116326	This fellow	3021	’ said Lord Frederick . ‘
116357	116364	116341	116341	He	3021	’ said Ralph with a sneer . ‘
116365	116372	116374	116376	the young man	900	’ Gad , so he has , ’
116378	116395	116374	116376	the young man	900	‘ deyvle take me if I know which is master in my house , he or I. ’
116396	116400	116402	116402	Ralph	208	‘ I know , ’
116404	116416	116418	116420	the young nobleman	3025	‘ I think I shall cut him off with a shilling , ’
116424	116432	116434	116435	Sir Mulberry	358	‘ No , no , curse it , ’
116437	116473	116434	116435	Sir Mulberry	358	‘ When you come to the shilling -- the last shilling -- I’ll cut you fast enough ; but till then , I ’ll never leave you -- you may take your oath of it . ’
116801	116804	116806	116807	Lord Frederick	229	‘ Well , ’
116816	116851	116806	116807	Lord Frederick	229	‘ if this is a discounting dinner , all I have to say is , deyvle take me , if it would n’t be a good pla - an to get discount every day . ’
116852	116864	116866	116868	Sir Mulberry Hawk	358	‘ You ’ll have plenty of it , in your time , ’
116870	116877	116866	116868	Sir Mulberry Hawk	358	‘ Nickleby will tell you that . ’
116878	116886	116888	116890	the young man	900	‘ What do you say , Nickleby ? ’
116892	116901	116888	116890	the young man	900	‘ am I to be a good customer ? ’
116902	116912	116914	116914	Ralph	208	‘ It depends entirely on circumstances , my lord , ’
116916	116923	116914	116914	Ralph	208	‘ On your lordship ’s circumstances , ’
117032	117036	117045	117045	he	3040	‘ infernal liberty , ’
117191	117197	117199	117200	Sir Mulberry	358	‘ Here is Miss Nickleby , ’
117202	117215	117199	117200	Sir Mulberry	358	‘ wondering why the deuce somebody does n’t make love to her . ’
117216	117221	117223	117223	Kate	210	‘ No , indeed , ’
117229	117231	117223	117223	Kate	210	‘ I-- ’
117250	117259	117261	117262	Sir Mulberry	358	‘ I ’ll hold any man fifty pounds , ’
117264	117284	117261	117262	Sir Mulberry	358	‘ that Miss Nickleby ca n’t look in my face , and tell me she was n’t thinking so . ’
117285	117288	117290	117292	the noble gull	3050	‘ Done ! ’
117294	117299	117290	117292	the noble gull	3050	‘ Within ten minutes . ’
117300	117303	117305	117306	Sir Mulberry	358	‘ Done ! ’
117336	117339	117341	117341	Kate	210	‘ Pray , ’
117356	117374	117341	117341	Kate	210	‘ Pray do not make me the subject of any bets . Uncle , I can not really-- ’
117375	117382	117384	117384	Ralph	208	‘ Why not , my dear ? ’
117416	117436	117401	117401	he	208	‘ It is done in a moment ; there is nothing in it . If the gentlemen insist on it-- ’
117437	117445	117447	117448	Sir Mulberry	358	‘ I do n’t insist on it , ’
117455	117500	117447	117448	Sir Mulberry	358	‘ That is , I by no means insist upon Miss Nickleby ’s making the denial , for if she does , I lose ; but I shall be glad to see her bright eyes , especially as she favours the mahogany so much . ’
117501	117521	117523	117525	the noble youth	3052	‘ So she does , and it ’s too ba - a - d of you , Miss Nickleby , ’
117527	117531	117533	117534	Mr. Pyke	359	‘ Quite cruel , ’
117536	117540	117542	117543	Mr. Pluck	360	‘ Horrid cruel , ’
117545	117555	117557	117558	Sir Mulberry	358	‘ I do n’t care if I do lose , ’
117560	117576	117557	117558	Sir Mulberry	358	‘ for one tolerable look at Miss Nickleby ’s eyes is worth double the money . ’
117577	117580	117582	117583	Mr. Pyke	359	‘ More , ’
117585	117589	117591	117592	Mr. Pluck	360	‘ Far more , ’
117594	117602	117591	117592	Mr. Pluck	360	‘ How goes the enemy , Snobb ? ’
117608	117613	117604	117606	Sir Mulberry Hawk	358	‘ Four minutes gone . ’
117614	117617	117557	117558	Sir Mulberry	358	‘ Bravo ! ’
117618	117633	117635	117636	Lord Frederick	229	‘ Wo n’t you ma - ake one effort for me , Miss Nickleby ? ’
117643	117655	117657	117658	Sir Mulberry	358	‘ You need n’t trouble yourself to inquire , my buck , ’
117660	117693	117657	117658	Sir Mulberry	358	‘ Miss Nickleby and I understand each other ; she declares on my side , and shows her taste . You have n’t a chance , old fellow . Time , Snobb ? ’
117694	117699	117728	117729	Mr. Pyke	359	‘ Eight minutes gone . ’
117700	117706	117708	117709	Sir Mulberry	358	‘ Get the money ready , ’
117711	117718	117708	117709	Sir Mulberry	358	‘ you ’ll soon hand over . ’
117719	117726	117728	117729	Mr. Pyke	359	‘ Ha , ha , ha ! ’
117871	117874	117876	117878	Sir Mulberry Hawk	358	‘ Capital ! ’
117887	117902	117876	117878	Sir Mulberry Hawk	358	‘ That ’s a girl of spirit , and we ’ll drink her health . ’
118286	118292	118294	118296	this accomplished gentleman	3069	‘ What a delightful studiousness ! ’
118298	118312	118294	118296	this accomplished gentleman	3069	‘ Was it real , now , or only to display the eyelashes ? ’
118325	118330	118313	118313	Kate	210	‘ I have looked at ‘
118336	118341	118313	118313	Kate	210	’ said Sir Mulberry . ‘
118347	118363	118313	118313	Kate	210	’re perfect . Why did I speak , and destroy such a pretty little picture ? ’
118364	118376	118378	118378	Kate	210	‘ Do me the favour to be silent now , sir , ’
118380	118386	118388	118389	Sir Mulberry	358	‘ No , do n’t , ’
118411	118448	118403	118403	himself	358	‘ upon my life , you ought n’t to . Such a devoted slave of yours , Miss Nickleby -- it ’s an infernal thing to treat him so harshly , upon my soul it is . ’
118449	118458	118460	118460	Kate	210	‘ I wish you to understand , sir , ’
118474	118498	118403	118403	himself	358	‘ that your behaviour offends and disgusts me . If you have a spark of gentlemanly feeling remaining , you will leave me . ’
118499	118503	118505	118506	Sir Mulberry	358	‘ Now why , ’
118508	118541	118505	118506	Sir Mulberry	358	‘ why will you keep up this appearance of excessive rigour , my sweet creature ? Now , be more natural -- my dear Miss Nickleby , be more natural -- do . ’
118562	118569	118570	118570	she	210	‘ Let me go , sir , ’
118579	118589	118570	118570	she	210	‘ Do you hear ? Instantly -- this moment . ’
118590	118597	118599	118600	Sir Mulberry	358	‘ Sit down , sit down , ’
118602	118610	118599	118600	Sir Mulberry	358	‘ I want to talk to you . ’
118611	118620	118622	118622	Kate	210	‘ Unhand me , sir , this instant , ’
118624	118630	118632	118633	Sir Mulberry	358	‘ Not for the world , ’
118698	118703	118705	118705	Ralph	208	‘ What is this ? ’
118707	118714	118716	118716	Kate	210	‘ It is this , sir , ’
118721	118766	118767	118767	Ralph	208	‘ that beneath the roof where I , a helpless girl , your dead brother ’s child , should most have found protection , I have been exposed to insult which should make you shrink to look upon me . Let me pass you . ’
118823	118831	118833	118833	Ralph	208	‘ Your way lies there , sir , ’
118849	118857	118859	118860	his friend	780	‘ What do you mean by that ? ’
118904	118914	118893	118893	he	208	‘ Do you know me , you old madman ? ’
118919	118922	118924	118924	Ralph	208	‘ Well , ’
118954	118963	118964	118964	he	208	‘ You wanted the lord , did you ? ’
118991	119003	119004	119004	Ralph	208	‘ Damme , I was in the way , was I ? ’
119013	119021	119004	119004	Ralph	208	‘ Who brought him to you first ? ’
119026	119046	119004	119004	Ralph	208	‘ and how , without me , could you ever have wound him in your net as you have ? ’
119047	119059	119061	119061	Ralph	208	‘ The net is a large one , and rather full , ’
119063	119074	119061	119061	Ralph	208	‘ Take care that it chokes nobody in the meshes . ’
119075	119100	119102	119103	the other	8439	‘ You would sell your flesh and blood for money ; yourself , if you have not already made a bargain with the devil , ’
119105	119129	119102	119103	the other	8439	‘ Do you mean to tell me that your pretty niece was not brought here as a decoy for the drunken boy downstairs ? ’
119179	119187	119188	119188	he	208	‘ Do you mean to tell me , ’
119192	119252	119188	119188	he	208	‘ that it is not so ? Do you mean to say that if he had found his way up here instead of me , you would n’t have been a little more blind , and a little more deaf , and a little less flourishing , than you have been ? Come , Nickleby , answer me that . ’
119253	119259	119261	119261	Ralph	208	‘ I tell you this , ’
119263	119276	119261	119261	Ralph	208	‘ that if I brought her here , as a matter of business-- ’
119277	119285	119287	119288	Sir Mulberry	358	‘ Ay , that ’s the word , ’
119294	119296	119299	119299	yourself	208	‘ You ’re
119303	119304	119299	119299	yourself	208	’ ‘
119311	119334	119299	119299	yourself	208	’ pursued Ralph , speaking slowly and firmly , as a man who has made up his mind to say no more , ‘
119452	119453	119449	119450	each other	8596	’ ‘
119467	119472	119449	119450	each other	8596	’ sneered Sir Mulberry . ‘
119476	119771	119449	119450	each other	8596	’ said Ralph . He had turned away , and looked over his shoulder to make this last reply . The eyes of the two worthies met , with an expression as if each rascal felt that there was no disguising himself from the other ; and Sir Mulberry Hawk shrugged his shoulders and walked slowly out . His friend closed the door , and looked restlessly towards the spot where his niece still remained in the attitude in which he had left her . She had flung herself heavily upon the couch , and with her head drooping over the cushion , and her face hidden in her hands , seemed to be still weeping in an agony of shame and grief . Ralph would have walked into any poverty - stricken debtor ’s house , and pointed him out to a bailiff , though in attendance upon a young child ’s death - bed , without the smallest concern , because it would have been a matter quite in the ordinary course of business , and the man would have been an offender against his only code of morality . But , here was a young girl , who had done no wrong save that of coming into the world alive ; who had patiently yielded to all his wishes ; who had tried hard to please him -- above all , who did n’t owe him money -- and he felt awkward and nervous . Ralph took a chair at some distance ; then , another chair a little nearer ; then , moved a little nearer still ; then , nearer again , and finally sat himself on the same sofa , and laid his hand on Kate ’s arm . ‘
119777	119794	119449	119450	each other	8596	’ he said , as she drew it back , and her sobs burst out afresh . ‘
119812	119813	119449	119450	each other	8596	’ ‘
119826	119830	119822	119822	me	0	’ cried Kate . ‘
119841	119842	119822	119822	me	0	’ ‘
119847	119851	119822	119822	me	0	’ said Ralph . ‘
119877	119878	119868	119868	me	0	’ ‘
119883	119891	119881	119881	uncle	8733	’ exclaimed Kate , clasping her hands . ‘
119948	119949	119953	119953	me	0	’ ‘
119958	119971	119953	119953	me	0	’ interrupted Ralph , seriously alarmed by the violence of her emotions . ‘
120031	120032	120033	120033	I	0	’ ‘
120038	120042	120044	120044	you	8733	’ replied Kate , ‘
120051	120052	120044	120044	you	8733	’ ‘
120060	120064	120057	120057	I	0	’ said Ralph ; ‘
120109	120535	120103	120103	You	702	’ With such encouragements as these , Ralph Nickleby walked to and fro , with his niece leaning on his arm ; actually trembling beneath her touch . In the same manner , when he judged it prudent to allow her to depart , he supported her downstairs , after adjusting her shawl and performing such little offices , most probably for the first time in his life . Across the hall , and down the steps , Ralph led her too ; nor did he withdraw his hand until she was seated in the coach . As the door of the vehicle was roughly closed , a comb fell from Kate ’s hair , close at her uncle ’s feet ; and as he picked it up , and returned it into her hand , the light from a neighbouring lamp shone upon her face . The lock of hair that had escaped and curled loosely over her brow , the traces of tears yet scarcely dry , the flushed cheek , the look of sorrow , all fired some dormant train of recollection in the old man ’s breast ; and the face of his dead brother seemed present before him , with the very look it bore on some occasion of boyish grief , of which every minutest circumstance flashed upon his mind , with the distinctness of a scene of yesterday . Ralph Nickleby , who was proof against all appeals of blood and kindred -- who was steeled against every tale of sorrow and distress -- staggered while he looked , and went back into his house , as a man who had seen a spirit from some world beyond the grave . CHAPTER 20 Wherein Nicholas at length encounters his Uncle , to whom he expresses his Sentiments with much Candour . His Resolution . Little Miss La Creevy trotted briskly through divers streets at the west end of the town , early on Monday morning -- the day after the dinner -- charged with the important commission of acquainting Madame Mantalini that Miss Nickleby was too unwell to attend that day , but hoped to be enabled to resume her duties on the morrow . And as Miss La Creevy walked along , revolving in her mind various genteel forms and elegant turns of expression , with a view to the selection of the very best in which to couch her communication , she cogitated a good deal upon the probable causes of her young friend ’s indisposition . ‘
120546	120552	120536	120536	I	0	’ said Miss La Creevy . ‘
120581	120632	120575	120575	She	3097	’ Arriving at this conclusion , which , indeed , she had established to her perfect satisfaction on the previous evening , Miss La Creevy went on to consider -- as she had done nearly all night -- what new cause of unhappiness her young friend could possibly have had . ‘
120640	120647	120633	120633	I	0	’ said the little portrait painter . ‘
120672	120726	120669	120670	Unpleasant brute	3099	’ Relieved by this expression of opinion , albeit it was vented upon empty air , Miss La Creevy trotted on to Madame Mantalini ’s ; and being informed that the governing power was not yet out of bed , requested an interview with the second in command ; whereupon Miss Knag appeared . ‘
120734	120752	120669	120670	Unpleasant brute	3099	’ said Miss Knag , when the message had been delivered , with many ornaments of speech ; ‘
120761	120762	120756	120757	Miss Nickleby	226	’ ‘
120769	120778	120756	120757	Miss Nickleby	226	’ rejoined Miss La Creevy , highly offended . ‘
120801	120802	120806	120806	ma’am	8678	’ ‘
120808	120813	120806	120806	ma’am	8678	’ said Miss Knag . ‘
120822	120823	120815	120815	you	8678	’ ‘
120832	120838	120826	120826	I	0	’ rejoined Miss La Creevy . ‘
120846	120851	120844	120844	ma’am	8678	’ said Miss Knag . ‘
120871	120924	120925	120925	I	0	’ rejoined Miss La Creevy . Thus terminating the interview , during which both ladies had trembled very much , and been marvellously polite -- certain indications that they were within an inch of a very desperate quarrel -- Miss La Creevy bounced out of the room , and into the street . ‘
120931	120938	120939	120943	A nice person to know	3106	’ said the queer little soul . ‘
120963	121273	120958	120958	I’D	0	’ So , feeling quite satisfied that she had said a very cutting thing at Miss Knag ’s expense , Miss La Creevy had a hearty laugh , and went home to breakfast in great good humour . Here was one of the advantages of having lived alone so long ! The little bustling , active , cheerful creature existed entirely within herself , talked to herself , made a confidante of herself , was as sarcastic as she could be , on people who offended her , by herself ; pleased herself , and did no harm . If she indulged in scandal , nobody ’s reputation suffered ; and if she enjoyed a little bit of revenge , no living soul was one atom the worse . One of the many to whom , from straitened circumstances , a consequent inability to form the associations they would wish , and a disinclination to mix with the society they could obtain , London is as complete a solitude as the plains of Syria , the humble artist had pursued her lonely , but contented way for many years ; and , until the peculiar misfortunes of the Nickleby family attracted her attention , had made no friends , though brimful of the friendliest feelings to all mankind . There are many warm hearts in the same solitary guise as poor little Miss La Creevy ’s . However , that ’s neither here nor there , just now . She went home to breakfast , and had scarcely caught the full flavour of her first sip of tea , when the servant announced a gentleman , whereat Miss La Creevy , at once imagining a new sitter transfixed by admiration at the street - door case , was in unspeakable consternation at the presence of the tea - things . ‘

121385	121396	121382	121383	Mr. Nicholas	235	’ cried Miss La Creevy , starting in great astonishment . ‘
121406	121414	121403	121403	I	0	’ replied Nicholas , extending his hand . ‘
121434	121444	121445	121445	Hannah	223	’ said Miss La Creevy , with a smile . ‘
121484	121485	121486	121486	You	9456	’ ‘
121496	121500	121494	121494	you	9456	’ asked Nicholas . ‘

121521	121562	121512	121512	You	9456	’ Nicholas , with becoming gallantry , immediately took Miss La Creevy at her word , who uttered a faint scream and slapped his face ; but it was not a very hard slap , and that ’s the truth . ‘
121571	121577	121578	121578	You	9456	’ exclaimed Miss La Creevy . ‘
121584	121588	121578	121578	You	9456	’ said Nicholas . ‘
121597	121603	121592	121592	I	0	’ rejoined Miss La Creevy . ‘
121611	121615	121616	121616	you	9456	’ said Nicholas ; ‘

121637	121643	121630	121630	you	0	’ retorted Miss La Creevy . ‘
121680	121704	121705	121705	I	0	’ She stopped here ; for there was so much heart in her altered tone and manner , that Nicholas was quite moved . ‘
121711	121720	121705	121705	I	0	’ he said , after a short silence ; ‘
121754	121755	121739	121739	I	0	’ ‘
121762	121768	121771	121771	you	235	’ exclaimed Miss La Creevy , ‘

121786	121796	121771	121771	you	235	’ answered Nicholas , with a more sprightly air ; ‘

121844	121850	121836	121836	I	0	’ interposed Miss La Creevy , ‘

121944	121950	121951	121951	Heaven	3118	’ rejoined Miss La Creevy . ‘

122044	122050	122035	122035	He	8478	’ said Miss La Creevy ; ‘

122070	122074	122064	122064	I	0	’ pursued Nicholas , ‘

122129	122139	122117	122117	I	0	’ said Miss La Creevy , rubbing her hands . ‘
122148	122152	122143	122143	I	0	’ she added , ‘
122166	122167	122168	122168	I	0	’ ‘
122173	122177	122168	122168	I	0	’ rejoined Nicholas ; ‘

122200	122206	122195	122195	You	0	’ said Miss La Creevy . ‘
122214	122218	122210	122210	I	0	’ answered Nicholas . ‘
122295	122296	122287	122287	you	0	’ ‘
122312	122318	122299	122299	I	0	’ said Miss La Creevy ; ‘
122344	122543	122341	122341	I	0	’ Talking on very fast and very much , Miss La Creevy finished her breakfast with great expedition , put away the tea - caddy and hid the key under the fender , resumed her bonnet , and , taking Nicholas ’s arm , sallied forth at once to the city . Nicholas left her near the door of his mother ’s house , and promised to return within a quarter of an hour . It so chanced that Ralph Nickleby , at length seeing fit , for his own purposes , to communicate the atrocities of which Nicholas had been guilty , had ( instead of first proceeding to another quarter of the town on business , as Newman Noggs supposed he would ) gone straight to his sister - in - law . Hence , when Miss La Creevy , admitted by a girl who was cleaning the house , made her way to the sitting - room , she found Mrs Nickleby and Kate in tears , and Ralph just concluding his statement of his nephew ’s misdemeanours . Kate beckoned her not to retire , and Miss La Creevy took a seat in silence . ‘
122555	122561	122563	122563	he	3129	’ thought the little woman . ‘
122577	122578	122566	122566	himself	3129	’ ‘
122583	122594	122566	122566	himself	3129	’ said Ralph , folding up Miss Squeers ’s note ; ‘

122666	122672	122660	122660	I	0	’ said Kate , indignantly ; ‘

122694	122698	122699	122699	you	702	’ said Ralph , ‘

122745	122749	122723	122724	this boy	8715	’ said Kate . ‘
122766	122850	122755	122755	Mama	357	’ Poor Mrs. Nickleby , who had , at no time , been remarkable for the possession of a very clear understanding , and who had been reduced by the late changes in her affairs to a most complicated state of perplexity , made no other reply to this earnest remonstrance than exclaiming from behind a mass of pocket - handkerchief , that she never could have believed it -- thereby most ingeniously leaving her hearers to suppose that she did believe it . ‘
122871	122875	122876	122876	my	0	’ said Ralph , ‘
122905	122926	122929	122929	I	0	’ said Ralph , speaking in a very marked manner , and looking furtively , but fixedly , at Kate , ‘
122951	123026	122946	122947	his mother	1090	’ added Ralph , as though by an afterthought , and with far less emphasis . Kate very well understood that this was held out as an additional inducement to her to preserve the strictest silence regarding the events of the preceding night . She looked involuntarily towards Ralph as he ceased to speak , but he had turned his eyes another way , and seemed for the moment quite unconscious of her presence . ‘
123029	123046	122946	122947	his mother	1090	’ said Ralph , after a long silence , broken only by Mrs Nickleby ’s sobs , ‘
123120	123121	123116	123116	you	3150	’ ‘
123125	123227	123116	123116	you	3150	’ cried a voice , as the door was dashed open , and Nicholas came into the room . In the first moment of surprise , and possibly of alarm , Ralph rose from his seat , and fell back a few paces , quite taken off his guard by this unexpected apparition . In another moment , he stood , fixed and immovable with folded arms , regarding his nephew with a scowl ; while Kate and Miss La Creevy threw themselves between the two , to prevent the personal violence which the fierce excitement of Nicholas appeared to threaten . ‘
123231	123240	123228	123229	Dear Nicholas	207	’ cried his sister , clinging to him . ‘
123245	123246	123249	123249	Kate	210	’ ‘
123251	123275	123249	123249	Kate	210	’ cried Nicholas , clasping her hand so tight in the tumult of his anger , that she could scarcely bear the pain . ‘
123299	123300	123288	123288	I	0	’ ‘
123304	123310	123288	123288	I	0	’ said Ralph , quietly ; ‘

123332	123337	123249	123249	Kate	210	’ cried Mrs. Nickleby , ‘
123350	123351	123249	123249	Kate	210	’ ‘
123371	123378	123249	123249	Kate	210	’ said Nicholas , looking round . ‘
123384	123392	123249	123249	Kate	210	’ replied Ralph , motioning towards her . ‘
123401	123405	123407	123407	you	0	’ said Nicholas ; ‘
123489	123497	123483	123483	I	0	’ said Nicholas , looking eagerly round , ‘

123707	123716	123704	123704	You	714	’ said Ralph , turning to Mrs. Nickleby . ‘
123721	123722	123704	123704	You	714	’ ‘
123727	123732	123704	123704	You	714	’ cried Mrs. Nickleby , ‘

123804	123810	123801	123802	The woman	3165	’ said Nicholas , haughtily , ‘

123907	123916	123901	123901	I	0	’ said Kate , looking towards her uncle . ‘

123953	123957	123958	123958	You	3176	’ rejoined Nicholas . ‘
123961	123971	123958	123958	You	3176	’ said Ralph , appealing to the mother again , ‘
123991	123992	123982	123982	you	3176	’ ‘
123999	124003	124004	124004	You	0	’ replied Nicholas . ‘
124008	124012	124004	124004	You	0	’ sneered Ralph . ‘
124015	124019	124004	124004	You	0	’ repeated Nicholas , ‘
124064	124065	124044	124044	I	0	’ ‘
124068	124072	124044	124044	I	0	’ said Ralph . ‘
124087	124088	124078	124078	you	714	’ ‘
124098	124106	124089	124089	You	0	’ replied Nicholas , embracing his sister . ‘

124125	124129	124113	124113	you	0	’ retorted Ralph ; ‘

124181	124253	124177	124177	I	0	’ sobbed Mrs. Nickleby . There really was no necessity for the good lady to be much distressed upon this particular head ; the extent of her worldly knowledge being , to say the least , very questionable ; and so Ralph seemed to think , for he smiled as she spoke . He then glanced steadily at her and Nicholas by turns , as he delivered himself in these words : ‘
124466	124566	124567	124567	I	0	’ If Ralph had not known and felt his power in wounding those he hated , his glances at Nicholas would have shown it him , in all its force , as he proceeded in the above address . Innocent as the young man was of all wrong , every artful insinuation stung , every well - considered sarcasm cut him to the quick ; and when Ralph noted his pale face and quivering lip , he hugged himself to mark how well he had chosen the taunts best calculated to strike deep into a young and ardent spirit . ‘
124573	124578	124567	124567	I	0	’ cried Mrs. Nickleby . ‘
124713	124755	124709	124709	I	0	’ Pouring forth these and a perfectly wonderful train of other disjointed expressions of regret , which no mortal power but Mrs. Nickleby ’s could ever have strung together , that lady wrung her hands , and her tears fell faster . ‘
124774	124782	124758	124758	you	714	’ asked Kate , with honest anger . ‘
124789	124790	124758	124758	you	714	’ ‘
124807	124812	124791	124791	I	0	’ said Mrs Nickleby ; ‘
124885	124903	124873	124873	I	0	’ With this extraordinary jumble of charitable institutions , Mrs. Nickleby again gave way to her tears . ‘
124906	124916	124917	124917	You	702	’ said Nicholas , as Ralph turned to go . ‘
124954	124955	124956	124956	Nicholas	207	’ ‘
124958	124970	124956	124956	Nicholas	207	’ cried Kate , throwing herself on her brother ’s shoulder , ‘
125023	125024	125013	125013	somebody	8568	’ ‘
125031	125037	125029	125029	Kate	210	’ said Nicholas , tenderly , ‘
125103	125109	125101	125101	Kate	210	’ he whispered , proudly , ‘
125122	125123	125118	125118	HE	9813	’ ‘
125132	125138	125118	125118	HE	9813	’ said Kate , eagerly , ‘
125220	125221	125222	125222	You	210	’ ‘
125231	125236	125237	125237	I	0	’ replied Nicholas hurriedly . ‘
125348	125388	125342	125343	Dear girl	3225	’ The grasp which had detained him relaxed , and Kate swooned in his arms . Nicholas stooped over her for a few seconds , and placing her gently in a chair , confided her to their honest friend . ‘
125396	125404	125389	125389	I	0	’ he said , wringing her hand , ‘
125417	125444	125411	125411	You	210	’ He stepped up to Ralph , who remained in the same attitude which he had preserved throughout the interview , and moved not a finger . ‘
125452	125463	125447	125447	you	210	’ he said , in a voice inaudible beyond themselves , ‘
125507	125673	125479	125479	your	210	’ Ralph did not allow a muscle of his face to indicate that he heard one word of this parting address . He hardly knew that it was concluded , and Mrs. Nickleby had scarcely made up her mind to detain her son by force if necessary , when Nicholas was gone . As he hurried through the streets to his obscure lodging , seeking to keep pace , as it were , with the rapidity of the thoughts which crowded upon him , many doubts and hesitations arose in his mind , and almost tempted him to return . But what would they gain by this ? Supposing he were to put Ralph Nickleby at defiance , and were even fortunate enough to obtain some small employment , his being with them could only render their present condition worse , and might greatly impair their future prospects ; for his mother had spoken of some new kindnesses towards Kate which she had not denied . ‘
125676	125680	125479	125479	your	210	’ thought Nicholas , ‘
125688	125998	125681	125681	I	0	’ But , before he had gone five hundred yards , some other and different feeling would come upon him , and then he would lag again , and pulling his hat over his eyes , give way to the melancholy reflections which pressed thickly upon him . To have committed no fault , and yet to be so entirely alone in the world ; to be separated from the only persons he loved , and to be proscribed like a criminal , when six months ago he had been surrounded by every comfort , and looked up to , as the chief hope of his family -- this was hard to bear . He had not deserved it either . Well , there was comfort in that ; and poor Nicholas would brighten up again , to be again depressed , as his quickly shifting thoughts presented every variety of light and shade before him . Undergoing these alternations of hope and misgiving , which no one , placed in a situation of ordinary trial , can fail to have experienced , Nicholas at length reached his poor room , where , no longer borne up by the excitement which had hitherto sustained him , but depressed by the revulsion of feeling it left behind , he threw himself on the bed , and turning his face to the wall , gave free vent to the emotions he had so long stifled . He had not heard anybody enter , and was unconscious of the presence of Smike , until , happening to raise his head , he saw him , standing at the upper end of the room , looking wistfully towards him . He withdrew his eyes when he saw that he was observed , and affected to be busied with some scanty preparations for dinner . ‘
126003	126014	126001	126001	Smike	264	’ said Nicholas , as cheerfully as he could speak , ‘
126047	126048	126001	126001	Smike	264	’ ‘
126051	126060	126001	126001	Smike	264	’ said Smike , shaking his head mournfully ; ‘
126069	126070	126061	126061	I	0	’ ‘
126076	126084	126061	126061	I	0	’ replied Nicholas , good - humouredly . ‘
126088	126092	126073	126073	you	264	’ said Smike . ‘
126158	126172	126155	126155	You	264	’ said the lad , laying his hand timidly on that of Nicholas , ‘
126235	126257	126226	126226	I	0	’ The poor fellow could say no more , for his eyes filled with tears , and his voice was gone . ‘
126264	126275	126226	126226	I	0	’ said Nicholas , grasping him heartily by the shoulder , ‘
126377	126514	126366	126366	You	264	’ CHAPTER 21 Madam Mantalini finds herself in a Situation of some Difficulty , and Miss Nickleby finds herself in no Situation at all The agitation she had undergone , rendered Kate Nickleby unable to resume her duties at the dressmaker ’s for three days , at the expiration of which interval she betook herself at the accustomed hour , and with languid steps , to the temple of fashion where Madame Mantalini reigned paramount and supreme . The ill - will of Miss Knag had lost nothing of its virulence in the interval . The young ladies still scrupulously shrunk from all companionship with their denounced associate ; and when that exemplary female arrived a few minutes afterwards , she was at no pains to conceal the displeasure with which she regarded Kate ’s return . ‘
126519	126539	126366	126366	You	264	’ said Miss Knag , as the satellites flocked round , to relieve her of her bonnet and shawl ; ‘
126586	126739	126745	126745	child	9793	’ Miss Knag , having passed this comment on the world , in the tone in which most people do pass comments on the world when they are out of temper , that is to say , as if they by no means belonged to it , concluded by heaving a sigh , wherewith she seemed meekly to compassionate the wickedness of mankind . The attendants were not slow to echo the sigh , and Miss Knag was apparently on the eve of favouring them with some further moral reflections , when the voice of Madame Mantalini , conveyed through the speaking - tube , ordered Miss Nickleby upstairs to assist in the arrangement of the show - room ; a distinction which caused Miss Knag to toss her head so much , and bite her lips so hard , that her powers of conversation were , for the time , annihilated . ‘
126747	126757	126826	126826	child	9793	’ said Madame Mantalini , when Kate presented herself ; ‘
126764	126765	126772	126772	you	3238	’ ‘
126774	126778	126772	126772	you	3238	’ replied Kate . ‘
126787	126800	126781	126781	I	0	’ remarked Madame Mantalini , seating herself with an air of weariness . ‘
126805	126809	126810	126810	I	0	’ asked Kate . ‘
126817	126818	126826	126826	child	9793	’ ‘
126830	126834	126826	126826	child	9793	’ rejoined Madame . ‘
126844	126850	126835	126835	I	0	’ said Kate , gently . ‘
126861	126862	126835	126835	I	0	’ ‘
126877	126890	126826	126826	child	9793	’ said Madame , rubbing her nose with much irritability of manner . ‘
126909	126954	126826	126826	child	9793	’ While Kate was wondering within herself what these symptoms of unusual vexation portended , Mr. Mantalini put the tips of his whiskers , and , by degrees , his head , through the half - opened door , and cried in a soft voice-- ‘
126962	126963	126826	126826	child	9793	’ ‘
126966	126971	126826	126826	child	9793	’ replied his wife . ‘
126997	127001	126826	126826	child	9793	’ urged Mantalini . ‘
127010	127011	126826	126826	child	9793	’ ‘
127015	127019	127020	127020	you	9793	’ replied Madame : ‘
127031	127074	126826	126826	child	9793	’ The poppet , however , encouraged perhaps by the relenting tone of this reply , ventured to rebel , and , stealing into the room , made towards Madame Mantalini on tiptoe , blowing her a kiss as he came along . ‘
127090	127116	126826	126826	child	9793	’ said Mantalini , putting his left arm round the waist of his life and soul , and drawing her towards him with his right . ‘
127125	127130	127119	127119	I	0	’ replied his wife . ‘
127139	127143	127137	127137	ME	0	’ exclaimed Mantalini . ‘
127176	127196	127156	127158	a woman alive	3244	’ Mr. Mantalini stroked his chin , as he said this , and glanced complacently at an opposite mirror . ‘
127201	127211	127214	127214	its	3245	’ reasoned his wife , in a low tone . ‘
127243	127247	127229	127241	such a demd , enchanting , bewitching , engrossing , captivating little Venus	3247	’ said Mantalini . ‘
127258	127262	127252	127252	you	9793	’ urged Madame . ‘
127278	127283	127274	127276	its own darling	3248	’ rejoined Mr. Mantalini . ‘
127333	127334	127325	127325	he	0	’ ‘
127337	127341	127325	127325	he	0	’ interposed Madame . ‘
127347	127606	127344	127344	you	9793	’ Mr. Mantalini , who , in his eagerness to make up matters with his wife , had overlooked , or feigned to overlook , Miss Nickleby hitherto , took the hint , and laying his finger on his lip , sunk his voice still lower . There was , then , a great deal of whispering , during which Madame Mantalini appeared to make reference , more than once , to certain debts incurred by Mr. Mantalini previous to her coverture ; and also to an unexpected outlay of money in payment of the aforesaid debts ; and furthermore , to certain agreeable weaknesses on that gentleman ’s part , such as gaming , wasting , idling , and a tendency to horse - flesh ; each of which matters of accusation Mr. Mantalini disposed of , by one kiss or more , as its relative importance demanded . The upshot of it all was , that Madame Mantalini was in raptures with him , and that they went upstairs to breakfast . Kate busied herself in what she had to do , and was silently arranging the various articles of decoration in the best taste she could display , when she started to hear a strange man ’s voice in the room , and started again , to observe , on looking round , that a white hat , and a red neckerchief , and a broad round face , and a large head , and part of a green coat were in the room too . ‘
127614	127622	127623	127623	I	0	’ said the proprietor of these appearances . ‘
127638	127639	127629	127633	the mantie - making consarn	3251	’ ‘
127642	127649	127629	127633	the mantie - making consarn	3251	’ rejoined Kate , greatly astonished . ‘
127655	127824	127652	127652	you	0	’ The stranger answered not ; but , first looking back , as though to beckon to some unseen person outside , came , very deliberately , into the room , and was closely followed by a little man in brown , very much the worse for wear , who brought with him a mingled fumigation of stale tobacco and fresh onions . The clothes of this gentleman were much bespeckled with flue ; and his shoes , stockings , and nether garments , from his heels to the waist buttons of his coat inclusive , were profusely embroidered with splashes of mud , caught a fortnight previously -- before the setting - in of the fine weather . Kate ’s very natural impression was , that these engaging individuals had called with the view of possessing themselves , unlawfully , of any portable articles that chanced to strike their fancy . She did not attempt to disguise her apprehensions , and made a move towards the door . ‘
127829	127850	127826	127827	a minnit	3252	’ said the man in the green coat , closing it softly , and standing with his back against it . ‘
127862	127863	127864	127864	My	0	’ ‘
127871	127880	127881	127881	governor	3254	’ asked Kate , trembling ; for she thought ‘
127882	127891	127892	127893	Mister Muntlehiney	370	’ might be slang for watch or money . ‘
127895	127900	127892	127893	Mister Muntlehiney	370	’ said the man . ‘
127912	127913	127908	127908	he	370	’ ‘
127922	127933	127914	127914	He	370	’ replied Kate , a little reassured by this inquiry . ‘
127939	127940	127935	127935	you	0	’ ‘
127943	127948	127935	127935	you	0	’ replied the visitor . ‘
127970	127997	128002	128003	the stranger	8829	‘ ere card , and tell him if he wants to speak to ME , and save trouble , here I am ; that ’s all . ’
128028	128038	128002	128003	the stranger	8829	‘ that the rooms was a good high pitch ; ’
128052	128071	128041	128042	the friend	9705	‘ that there was lots of room for a little boy to grow up a man in either on ‘
128089	128114	128115	128115	Scaley	371	’ After ringing the bell which would summon Madame Mantalini , Kate glanced at the card , and saw that it displayed the name of ‘
128117	128179	128115	128115	Scaley	371	’ together with some other information to which she had not had time to refer , when her attention was attracted by Mr. Scaley himself , who , walking up to one of the cheval - glasses , gave it a hard poke in the centre with his stick , as coolly as if it had been made of cast iron . ‘
128187	128195	128185	128185	Tix	372	’ said Mr. Scaley to his friend . ‘
128198	128228	128185	128185	Tix	372	’ rejoined Mr. Tix , placing the marks of his four fingers , and a duplicate impression of his thumb , on a piece of sky - blue silk ; ‘
128241	128319	128239	128239	you	372	’ From the silk , Mr. Tix transferred his admiration to some elegant articles of wearing apparel , while Mr. Scaley adjusted his neckcloth , at leisure , before the glass , and afterwards , aided by its reflection , proceeded to the minute consideration of a pimple on his chin ; in which absorbing occupation he was yet engaged , when Madame Mantalini , entering the room , uttered an exclamation of surprise which roused him . ‘
128327	128331	128324	128325	the missis	3259	’ inquired Scaley . ‘
128337	128341	128334	128335	Madame Mantalini	290	’ said Kate . ‘
128344	128362	128334	128335	Madame Mantalini	290	’ said Mr. Scaley , producing a small document from his pocket and unfolding it very slowly , ‘
128394	128665	128334	128335	Madame Mantalini	290	’ Poor Madame Mantalini wrung her hands for grief , and rung the bell for her husband ; which done , she fell into a chair and a fainting fit , simultaneously . The professional gentlemen , however , were not at all discomposed by this event , for Mr. Scaley , leaning upon a stand on which a handsome dress was displayed ( so that his shoulders appeared above it , in nearly the same manner as the shoulders of the lady for whom it was designed would have done if she had had it on ) , pushed his hat on one side and scratched his head with perfect unconcern , while his friend Mr. Tix , taking that opportunity for a general survey of the apartment preparatory to entering on business , stood with his inventory - book under his arm and his hat in his hand , mentally occupied in putting a price upon every object within his range of vision . Such was the posture of affairs when Mr. Mantalini hurried in ; and as that distinguished specimen had had a pretty extensive intercourse with Mr. Scaley ’s fraternity in his bachelor days , and was , besides , very far from being taken by surprise on the present agitating occasion , he merely shrugged his shoulders , thrust his hands down to the bottom of his pockets , elevated his eyebrows , whistled a bar or two , swore an oath or two , and , sitting astride upon a chair , put the best face upon the matter with great composure and decency . ‘
128672	128680	128334	128335	Madame Mantalini	290	’ was the first question he asked . ‘
128694	128704	128334	128335	Madame Mantalini	290	’ replied Mr. Scaley , without moving a limb . ‘
128710	128717	128334	128335	Madame Mantalini	290	’ said Mr. Mantalini , impatiently . ‘
128726	128731	128722	128722	you	3262	’ retorted Mr. Scaley ; ‘
128736	128737	128334	128335	Madame Mantalini	290	’ ‘
128763	128768	128759	128759	I	0	’ observed Mr. Tix . ‘
128773	128777	128759	128759	I	0	’ said Scaley . ‘
128780	128790	128759	128759	I	0	’ said the same gentleman , after a pause , ‘
128875	128885	128873	128873	herself	8485	’ continued Mr Scaley , as Madame Mantalini sobbed . ‘
128916	128960	128961	128961	My	0	’ With these remarks , combining great pleasantry with sound moral encouragement under difficulties , Mr. Scaley proceeded to take the inventory , in which delicate task he was materially assisted by the uncommon tact and experience of Mr. Tix , the broker . ‘
128968	128980	128961	128961	My	0	’ said Mantalini , approaching his wife with a penitent air ; ‘
128990	128991	128982	128982	you	3264	’ ‘
129000	129007	129008	129008	You	0	’ replied his wife , sobbing . ‘
129018	129085	129086	129087	Miss Nickleby	226	’ Mr. Mantalini , who had doubtless well considered his part , no sooner heard these words pronounced in a tone of grief and severity , than he recoiled several paces , assumed an expression of consuming mental agony , rushed headlong from the room , and was , soon afterwards , heard to slam the door of an upstairs dressing - room with great violence . ‘
129089	129101	129086	129087	Miss Nickleby	226	’ cried Madame Mantalini , when this sound met her ear , ‘
129136	129211	129134	129134	Alfred	229	’ With such exclamations , she hurried upstairs , followed by Kate who , although she did not quite participate in the fond wife ’s apprehensions , was a little flurried , nevertheless . The dressing - room door being hastily flung open , Mr. Mantalini was disclosed to view , with his shirt - collar symmetrically thrown back : putting a fine edge to a breakfast knife by means of his razor strop . ‘
129214	129219	129134	129134	Alfred	229	’ cried Mr. Mantalini , ‘
129222	129259	129260	129260	Alfred	229	’ and whisk went the breakfast knife into Mr. Mantalini ’s dressing - gown pocket , while Mr. Mantalini ’s eyes rolled wildly , and his hair floating in wild disorder , mingled with his whiskers . ‘
129262	129273	129260	129260	Alfred	229	’ cried his wife , flinging her arms about him , ‘
129290	129291	129282	129282	I	0	’ ‘
129294	129299	129301	129301	I	0	’ cried Mr. Mantalini . ‘
129323	129371	129317	129317	Demmit	291	’ At this crisis of his ravings Mr. Mantalini made a pluck at the breakfast knife , and being restrained by his wife ’s grasp , attempted to dash his head against the wall -- taking very good care to be at least six feet from it . ‘
129379	129383	129373	129373	yourself	229	’ said Madame . ‘
129411	129640	129407	129407	Alfred	229	’ Mr. Mantalini did not think proper to come to , all at once ; but , after calling several times for poison , and requesting some lady or gentleman to blow his brains out , gentler feelings came upon him , and he wept pathetically . In this softened frame of mind he did not oppose the capture of the knife -- which , to tell the truth , he was rather glad to be rid of , as an inconvenient and dangerous article for a skirt pocket -- and finally he suffered himself to be led away by his affectionate partner . After a delay of two or three hours , the young ladies were informed that their services would be dispensed with until further notice , and at the expiration of two days , the name of Mantalini appeared in the list of bankrupts : Miss Nickleby received an intimation per post , on the same morning , that the business would be , in future , carried on under the name of Miss Knag , and that her assistance would no longer be required -- a piece of intelligence with which Mrs. Nickleby was no sooner made acquainted , than that good lady declared she had expected it all along and cited divers unknown occasions on which she had prophesied to that precise effect . ‘
129646	129667	129668	129668	I	0	’ remarked Mrs. Nickleby ( who , it is scarcely necessary to observe , had never said so before ) , ‘
129726	129727	129720	129720	you	210	’ ‘
129734	129740	129732	129732	mama	9827	’ said Kate , mildly : ‘
129747	129748	129743	129743	you	9827	’ ‘
129751	129756	129732	129732	mama	9827	’ cried Mrs. Nickleby , ‘
129942	130115	130117	130117	I	0	’ Kate knew , perfectly well , that this torrent of favourable recollection was occasioned by some opening , real or imaginary , which her mother had discovered , in the companionship walk of life . She therefore waited , very patiently , until all reminiscences and anecdotes , bearing or not bearing upon the subject , had been exhausted , and at last ventured to inquire what discovery had been made . The truth then came out . Mrs Nickleby had , that morning , had a yesterday ’s newspaper of the very first respectability from the public - house where the porter came from ; and in this yesterday ’s newspaper was an advertisement , couched in the purest and most grammatical English , announcing that a married lady was in want of a genteel young person as companion , and that the married lady ’s name and address were to be known , on application at a certain library at the west end of the town , therein mentioned . ‘
130120	130132	130117	130117	I	0	’ exclaimed Mrs. Nickleby , laying the paper down in triumph , ‘
130148	130777	130117	130117	I	0	’ Kate was too sick at heart , after the rough jostling she had already had with the world , and really cared too little at the moment what fate was reserved for her , to make any objection . Mr. Ralph Nickleby offered none , but , on the contrary , highly approved of the suggestion ; neither did he express any great surprise at Madame Mantalini ’s sudden failure , indeed it would have been strange if he had , inasmuch as it had been procured and brought about chiefly by himself . So , the name and address were obtained without loss of time , and Miss Nickleby and her mama went off in quest of Mrs. Wititterly , of Cadogan Place , Sloane Street , that same forenoon . Cadogan Place is the one slight bond that joins two great extremes ; it is the connecting link between the aristocratic pavements of Belgrave Square , and the barbarism of Chelsea . It is in Sloane Street , but not of it . The people in Cadogan Place look down upon Sloane Street , and think Brompton low . They affect fashion too , and wonder where the New Road is . Not that they claim to be on precisely the same footing as the high folks of Belgrave Square and Grosvenor Place , but that they stand , with reference to them , rather in the light of those illegitimate children of the great who are content to boast of their connections , although their connections disavow them . Wearing as much as they can of the airs and semblances of loftiest rank , the people of Cadogan Place have the realities of middle station . It is the conductor which communicates to the inhabitants of regions beyond its limit , the shock of pride of birth and rank , which it has not within itself , but derives from a fountain - head beyond ; or , like the ligament which unites the Siamese twins , it contains something of the life and essence of two distinct bodies , and yet belongs to neither . Upon this doubtful ground , lived Mrs. Wititterly , and at Mrs. Wititterly ’s door Kate Nickleby knocked with trembling hand . The door was opened by a big footman with his head floured , or chalked , or painted in some way ( it did n’t look genuine powder ) , and the big footman , receiving the card of introduction , gave it to a little page ; so little , indeed , that his body would not hold , in ordinary array , the number of small buttons which are indispensable to a page ’s costume , and they were consequently obliged to be stuck on four abreast . This young gentleman took the card upstairs on a salver , and pending his return , Kate and her mother were shown into a dining - room of rather dirty and shabby aspect , and so comfortably arranged as to be adapted to almost any purpose rather than eating and drinking . Now , in the ordinary course of things , and according to all authentic descriptions of high life , as set forth in books , Mrs. Wititterly ought to have been in her BOUDOIR ; but whether it was that Mr. Wititterly was at that moment shaving himself in the BOUDOIR or what not , certain it is that Mrs. Wititterly gave audience in the drawing - room , where was everything proper and necessary , including curtains and furniture coverings of a roseate hue , to shed a delicate bloom on Mrs. Wititterly ’s complexion , and a little dog to snap at strangers ’

130950	130953	130955	130956	Mrs. Wititterly	374	‘ Yes , ’
130958	130971	130955	130956	Mrs. Wititterly	374	‘ one of my people put it in the paper -- Yes . ’
130972	130978	130980	130980	Kate	210	‘ I thought , perhaps , ’
130984	131006	130980	130980	Kate	210	‘ that if you had not already made a final choice , you would forgive my troubling you with an application . ’
131007	131010	131012	131013	Mrs. Wititterly	374	‘ Yes , ’
131016	131024	131012	131013	Mrs. Wititterly	374	‘ If you have already made a selection-- ’
131025	131030	131032	131033	the lady	8485	‘ Oh dear no , ’
131035	131063	131032	131033	the lady	8485	‘ I am not so easily suited . I really do n’t know what to say . You have never been a companion before , have you ? ’
131084	131092	131094	131096	the good lady	8773	‘ Not to any stranger , ma’am , ’
131098	131118	131094	131096	the good lady	8773	‘ but she has been a companion to me for some years . I am her mother , ma’am . ’
131119	131122	131124	131125	Mrs. Wititterly	374	‘ Oh ! ’
131127	131132	131124	131125	Mrs. Wititterly	374	‘ I apprehend you . ’
131133	131140	131142	131143	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ I assure you , ma’am , ’
131145	131202	131142	131143	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ that I very little thought , at one time , that it would be necessary for my daughter to go out into the world at all , for her poor dear papa was an independent gentleman , and would have been at this moment if he had but listened in time to my constant entreaties and-- ’
131203	131207	131209	131209	Kate	210	‘ Dear mama , ’
131216	131229	131231	131232	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ My dear Kate , if you will allow me to speak , ’
131234	131245	131231	131232	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ I shall take the liberty of explaining to this lady-- ’
131246	131256	131286	131286	her	210	‘ I think it is almost unnecessary , mama . ’
131308	131314	131316	131317	Mrs. Wititterly	374	‘ What are your accomplishments ? ’
131373	131380	131382	131383	Mrs. Wititterly	374	‘ You are a good temper ? ’
131397	131402	131404	131404	Kate	210	‘ I hope so , ’
131406	131419	131423	131423	she	210	‘ And have a highly respectable reference for everything , have you ? ’
131436	131455	131457	131458	Mrs. Wititterly	374	‘ Have the goodness to draw your chair a little nearer , and let me look at you , ’
131460	131475	131457	131458	Mrs. Wititterly	374	‘ I am so very nearsighted that I ca n’t quite discern your features . ’
131508	131514	131516	131517	that lady	1897	‘ I like your appearance , ’
131524	131534	131516	131517	that lady	1897	‘ Alphonse , request your master to come here . ’
131605	131608	131609	131609	he	3304	‘ Oh ! ’
131615	131647	131609	131609	he	3304	‘ yes . This is a most important matter . Mrs Wititterly is of a very excitable nature ; very delicate , very fragile ; a hothouse plant , an exotic . ’
131648	131656	131658	131659	Mrs. Wititterly	374	‘ Oh ! Henry , my dear , ’
131661	131675	131677	131678	Mr. W.	377	‘ You are , my love , you know you are ; one breath-- ’
131686	131690	131677	131678	Mr. W.	377	‘ Pho ! you ’re
131693	131698	131677	131678	Mr. W.	377	’ The lady sighed . ‘
131708	131713	131714	131714	Your	374	’ said Mr. Wititterly . ‘
131864	131919	131920	131920	You	378	’ Here Mr. Wititterly , who , in the ardour of his description , had flourished his right hand to within something less than an inch of Mrs. Nickleby ’s bonnet , drew it hastily back again , and blew his nose as fiercely as if it had been done by some violent machinery . ‘
131931	131941	131929	131929	Henry	247	’ said Mrs. Wititterly , with a faint smile . ‘
131952	131956	131948	131948	I	0	’ said Mr. W. ‘
132018	132019	132020	132020	I	0	’ ‘
132028	132033	132020	132020	I	0	’ said Mrs. Wititterly . ‘
132040	132045	132020	132020	I	0	’ rejoined her husband , ‘
132069	132111	132049	132050	a companion	11196	’ Here , both Mr. and Mrs. Wititterly , who had talked rather at the Nicklebys than to each other , left off speaking , and looked at their two hearers , with an expression of countenance which seemed to say , ‘
132120	132121	132114	132114	you	379	’ ‘
132125	132136	132122	132123	Mrs. Wititterly	374	’ said her husband , addressing himself to Mrs. Nickleby , ‘
132168	132169	132170	132171	The nobility	9895	’ ‘
132176	132181	132182	132183	The nobility	9895	’ interposed Mrs. Wititterly . ‘
132188	132193	132182	132183	The nobility	9895	’ said Mr. Wititterly . ‘
132247	132248	132231	132231	they	3321	’ ‘
132253	132258	132251	132251	Henry	247	’ said the lady ; ‘
132264	132265	132266	132266	I	0	’ ‘
132273	132278	132271	132271	Julia	379	’ replied Mr. Wititterly ; ‘
132343	132439	132440	132440	They	3326	’ In obedience to this request , the qualifications were all gone through again , with the addition of many interruptions and cross - questionings from Mr. Wititterly . It was finally arranged that inquiries should be made , and a decisive answer addressed to Miss Nickleby under cover of her uncle , within two days . These conditions agreed upon , the page showed them down as far as the staircase window ; and the big footman , relieving guard at that point , piloted them in perfect safety to the street - door . ‘
132448	132461	132440	132440	They	3326	’ said Mrs. Nickleby , as she took her daughter ’s arm . ‘
132470	132471	132466	132467	Mrs. Wititterly	374	’ ‘
132479	132486	132477	132477	mama	9827	’ was all Kate ’s reply . ‘
132500	132505	132506	132506	She	374	’ rejoined her mother . ‘
132533	133221	132518	132518	she	374	’ These considerations led the deep - sighted lady into a calculation of the probable duration of Mrs. Wititterly ’s life , and the chances of the disconsolate widower bestowing his hand on her daughter . Before reaching home , she had freed Mrs. Wititterly ’s soul from all bodily restraint ; married Kate with great splendour at St George ’s , Hanover Square ; and only left undecided the minor question , whether a splendid French - polished mahogany bedstead should be erected for herself in the two - pair back of the house in Cadogan Place , or in the three - pair front : between which apartments she could not quite balance the advantages , and therefore adjusted the question at last , by determining to leave it to the decision of her son - in - law . The inquiries were made . The answer -- not to Kate ’s very great joy -- was favourable ; and at the expiration of a week she betook herself , with all her movables and valuables , to Mrs. Wititterly ’s mansion , where for the present we will leave her . CHAPTER 22 Nicholas , accompanied by Smike , sallies forth to seek his Fortune . He encounters Mr. Vincent Crummles ; and who he was , is herein made manifest The whole capital which Nicholas found himself entitled to , either in possession , reversion , remainder , or expectancy , after paying his rent and settling with the broker from whom he had hired his poor furniture , did not exceed , by more than a few halfpence , the sum of twenty shillings . And yet he hailed the morning on which he had resolved to quit London , with a light heart , and sprang from his bed with an elasticity of spirit which is happily the lot of young persons , or the world would never be stocked with old ones . It was a cold , dry , foggy morning in early spring . A few meagre shadows flitted to and fro in the misty streets , and occasionally there loomed through the dull vapour , the heavy outline of some hackney coach wending homewards , which , drawing slowly nearer , rolled jangling by , scattering the thin crust of frost from its whitened roof , and soon was lost again in the cloud . At intervals were heard the tread of slipshod feet , and the chilly cry of the poor sweep as he crept , shivering , to his early toil ; the heavy footfall of the official watcher of the night , pacing slowly up and down and cursing the tardy hours that still intervened between him and sleep ; the rambling of ponderous carts and waggons ; the roll of the lighter vehicles which carried buyers and sellers to the different markets ; the sound of ineffectual knocking at the doors of heavy sleepers -- all these noises fell upon the ear from time to time , but all seemed muffled by the fog , and to be rendered almost as indistinct to the ear as was every object to the sight . The sluggish darkness thickened as the day came on ; and those who had the courage to rise and peep at the gloomy street from their curtained windows , crept back to bed again , and coiled themselves up to sleep . Before even these indications of approaching morning were rife in busy London , Nicholas had made his way alone to the city , and stood beneath the windows of his mother ’s house . It was dull and bare to see , but it had light and life for him ; for there was at least one heart within its old walls to which insult or dishonour would bring the same blood rushing , that flowed in his own veins . He crossed the road , and raised his eyes to the window of the room where he knew his sister slept . It was closed and dark . ‘
133225	133229	133230	133230	she	707	’ thought Nicholas , ‘
133237	133263	133230	133230	she	707	’ He looked again , and felt , for the moment , almost vexed that Kate was not there to exchange one word at parting . ‘
133267	133275	133264	133265	Good God	225	’ he thought , suddenly correcting himself , ‘
133282	133283	133277	133278	a boy	8366	’ ‘
133291	133312	133277	133278	a boy	8366	’ said Nicholas , after he had lounged on , a few paces , and returned to the same spot . ‘
133347	133411	133332	133332	I	0	’ As he spoke , some fancied motion of the curtain almost persuaded him , for the instant , that Kate was at the window , and by one of those strange contradictions of feeling which are common to us all , he shrunk involuntarily into a doorway , that she might not see him . He smiled at his own weakness ; said ‘
133416	133501	133332	133332	I	0	’ and walked away with a lighter step . Smike was anxiously expecting him when he reached his old lodgings , and so was Newman , who had expended a day ’s income in a can of rum and milk to prepare them for the journey . They had tied up the luggage , Smike shouldered it , and away they went , with Newman Noggs in company ; for he had insisted on walking as far as he could with them , overnight . ‘
133505	133511	133332	133332	I	0	’ asked Newman , wistfully . ‘
133516	133520	133513	133513	Kingston	382	’ replied Nicholas . ‘
133525	133529	133533	133533	you	3335	’ asked Newman . ‘
133537	133538	133533	133533	you	3335	’ ‘
133548	133559	133540	133540	I	0	’ rejoined Nicholas , laying his hand upon his shoulder ; ‘
133589	133590	133591	133591	I	0	’ ‘
133603	133609	133594	133594	you	3335	’ said Newman , doubtfully . ‘
133613	133619	133594	133594	you	3335	’ replied his young friend , ‘
133642	133643	133636	133636	I	0	’ ‘
133649	133653	133644	133644	You	3335	’ said Newman . ‘
133661	133665	133654	133654	I	0	’ rejoined Nicholas . ‘
133687	133804	133673	133673	I	0	’ Occupied in such discourse , they walked on for a couple of hours , as they might have done for a couple of days if Nicholas had not sat himself down on a stone by the wayside , and resolutely declared his intention of not moving another step until Newman Noggs turned back . Having pleaded ineffectually first for another half - mile , and afterwards for another quarter , Newman was fain to comply , and to shape his course towards Golden Square , after interchanging many hearty and affectionate farewells , and many times turning back to wave his hat to the two wayfarers when they had become mere specks in the distance . ‘
133812	133824	133810	133810	Smike	264	’ said Nicholas , as they trudged with stout hearts onwards . ‘
133831	133870	133871	133871	I	0	’ Smike nodded his head and smiled , but expressed no other emotion ; for whether they had been bound for Portsmouth or Port Royal would have been alike to him , so they had been bound together . ‘
133880	133884	133871	133871	I	0	’ resumed Nicholas ; ‘
133931	133932	133929	133929	you	264	’ ‘
133937	133941	133929	133929	you	264	’ replied Smike . ‘
133954	133955	133948	133948	you	264	’ ‘
133961	133965	133958	133958	I	0	’ said Nicholas . ‘
133973	133974	133966	133966	You	264	’ ‘
133982	133997	133998	133998	I	0	’ resumed Smike ; his eyes sparkling at the prospect of displaying his abilities ; ‘
134012	134013	134010	134010	anybody	8517	’ ‘
134016	134022	134010	134010	anybody	8517	’ said Nicholas , gravely . ‘
134082	134083	134085	134085	I	0	’ ‘
134090	134098	134085	134085	I	0	’ said Smike , brightening up again . ‘
134104	134108	134099	134099	God	225	’ rejoined Nicholas ; ‘
134127	134128	134119	134119	I	0	’ ‘
134137	134146	134119	134119	I	0	’ asked Smike , after a short silence . ‘
134161	134172	134119	134119	I	0	’ said Nicholas , with a good - humoured smile . ‘
134227	134228	134218	134218	me	0	’ ‘
134233	134243	134218	134218	me	0	’ rejoined Smike , falling back a few steps . ‘
134255	134256	134247	134247	me	0	’ ‘
134260	134264	134247	134247	me	0	’ asked Nicholas . ‘
134275	134279	134266	134266	me	0	’ said Smike . ‘
134309	134310	134296	134296	I	0	’ ‘
134340	134344	134331	134331	I	0	’ rejoined Nicholas . ‘
134364	134375	134346	134346	me	0	’ he added , looking him steadily in the face . ‘
134382	134383	134384	134384	I	0	’ ‘
134389	134398	134384	134384	I	0	’ said Smike , shaking his head sorrowfully . ‘
134415	134416	134399	134399	I	0	’ ‘
134425	134448	134419	134419	you	0	’ asked Nicholas , turning quickly upon him as though the answer in some way helped out the purport of his question . ‘
134460	134464	134450	134450	I	0	’ said Smike , ‘
134523	134524	134513	134513	I	0	’ ‘
134530	134540	134525	134525	You	0	’ said Nicholas , touching him on the arm . ‘
134543	134552	134553	134553	I	0	’ replied his companion , with a vacant look ‘
134558	134566	134553	134553	I	0	’ He shivered involuntarily as he spoke . ‘
134580	134614	134553	134553	I	0	’ retorted Nicholas , fixing his eyes full upon that of his companion , which was fast settling into an unmeaning stupefied gaze , once habitual to him , and common even then . ‘
134625	134626	134620	134620	you	0	’ ‘
134629	134634	134620	134620	you	0	’ cried the lad . ‘
134648	134653	134642	134642	your	0	’ said Nicholas quietly . ‘
134661	134662	134695	134695	they	3352	’ ‘
134665	134670	134695	134695	they	3352	’ replied the boy . ‘
134755	134756	134741	134741	myself	0	’ ‘
134762	134770	134758	134758	you	0	’ repeated Nicholas , with assumed carelessness ; ‘
134775	134776	134777	134780	Such a little creature	3354	’ ‘
134782	134786	134777	134780	Such a little creature	3354	’ said Smike , ‘
134803	134804	134788	134788	they	3352	’ ‘
134815	134819	134805	134805	You	0	’ remarked Nicholas . ‘
134822	134826	134805	134805	You	0	’ rejoined Smike , ‘
134830	134831	134805	134805	You	0	’ ‘
134837	134838	134839	134840	A man	625	’ ‘
134893	134894	134879	134879	they	3352	’ ‘
134899	134910	134879	134879	they	3352	’ said Nicholas , wishing to attract his full attention . ‘
134945	134946	134921	134922	no woman	3358	’ ‘
134949	134959	134921	134922	no woman	3358	’ said the poor creature , shaking his head , ‘
134964	134965	134921	134922	no woman	3358	’ ‘
134975	134976	134921	134922	no woman	3358	’ ‘
134979	134989	134921	134922	no woman	3358	’ rejoined the youth , with a melancholy look ; ‘
135136	135137	135139	135139	you	3371	’ ‘
135147	135156	135139	135139	you	3371	’ asked Nicholas , abruptly changing the theme . ‘
135159	135163	135139	135139	you	3371	’ said Smike , ‘
135173	135744	135745	135748	The Devil ’s Bowl	3373	’ He quickened his pace as he said this , apparently under the impression that they had been standing still during the whole of the previous dialogue . Nicholas marked him closely , and every word of this conversation remained upon his memory . It was , by this time , within an hour of noon , and although a dense vapour still enveloped the city they had left , as if the very breath of its busy people hung over their schemes of gain and profit , and found greater attraction there than in the quiet region above , in the open country it was clear and fair . Occasionally , in some low spots they came upon patches of mist which the sun had not yet driven from their strongholds ; but these were soon passed , and as they laboured up the hills beyond , it was pleasant to look down , and see how the sluggish mass rolled heavily off , before the cheering influence of day . A broad , fine , honest sun lighted up the green pastures and dimpled water with the semblance of summer , while it left the travellers all the invigorating freshness of that early time of year . The ground seemed elastic under their feet ; the sheep - bells were music to their ears ; and exhilarated by exercise , and stimulated by hope , they pushed onward with the strength of lions . The day wore on , and all these bright colours subsided , and assumed a quieter tint , like young hopes softened down by time , or youthful features by degrees resolving into the calm and serenity of age . But they were scarcely less beautiful in their slow decline , than they had been in their prime ; for nature gives to every time and season some beauties of its own ; and from morning to night , as from the cradle to the grave , is but a succession of changes so gentle and easy , that we can scarcely mark their progress . To Godalming they came at last , and here they bargained for two humble beds , and slept soundly . In the morning they were astir : though not quite so early as the sun : and again afoot ; if not with all the freshness of yesterday , still , with enough of hope and spirit to bear them cheerily on . It was a harder day ’s journey than yesterday ’s , for there were long and weary hills to climb ; and in journeys , as in life , it is a great deal easier to go down hill than up . However , they kept on , with unabated perseverance , and the hill has not yet lifted its face to heaven that perseverance will not gain the summit of at last . They walked upon the rim of the Devil ’s Punch Bowl ; and Smike listened with greedy interest as Nicholas read the inscription upon the stone which , reared upon that wild spot , tells of a murder committed there by night . The grass on which they stood , had once been dyed with gore ; and the blood of the murdered man had run down , drop by drop , into the hollow which gives the place its name . ‘
135750	135761	135745	135748	The Devil ’s Bowl	3373	’ thought Nicholas , as he looked into the void , ‘
135769	136069	135745	135748	The Devil ’s Bowl	3373	’ Onward they kept , with steady purpose , and entered at length upon a wide and spacious tract of downs , with every variety of little hill and plain to change their verdant surface . Here , there shot up , almost perpendicularly , into the sky , a height so steep , as to be hardly accessible to any but the sheep and goats that fed upon its sides , and there , stood a mound of green , sloping and tapering off so delicately , and merging so gently into the level ground , that you could scarce define its limits . Hills swelling above each other ; and undulations shapely and uncouth , smooth and rugged , graceful and grotesque , thrown negligently side by side , bounded the view in each direction ; while frequently , with unexpected noise , there uprose from the ground a flight of crows , who , cawing and wheeling round the nearest hills , as if uncertain of their course , suddenly poised themselves upon the wing and skimmed down the long vista of some opening valley , with the speed of light itself . By degrees , the prospect receded more and more on either hand , and as they had been shut out from rich and extensive scenery , so they emerged once again upon the open country . The knowledge that they were drawing near their place of destination , gave them fresh courage to proceed ; but the way had been difficult , and they had loitered on the road , and Smike was tired . Thus , twilight had already closed in , when they turned off the path to the door of a roadside inn , yet twelve miles short of Portsmouth . ‘
136073	136091	135745	135748	The Devil ’s Bowl	3373	’ said Nicholas , leaning with both hands on his stick , and looking doubtfully at Smike . ‘
136096	136101	135745	135748	The Devil ’s Bowl	3373	’ repeated the landlord . ‘
136108	136112	135745	135748	The Devil ’s Bowl	3373	’ inquired Nicholas . ‘
136116	136133	135745	135748	The Devil ’s Bowl	3373	’ said the landlord . As of course , being a landlord , he would say . ‘
136140	136146	136134	136134	I	0	’ observed Nicholas , hesitating . ‘
136154	136155	136147	136147	I	0	’ ‘
136163	136168	136159	136159	me	0	’ rejoined the landlord . ‘
136179	136180	136169	136169	I	0	’ ‘
136185	136194	136169	136169	I	0	’ asked Nicholas , with the same uncertainty . ‘
136205	136321	136197	136197	I	0	’ said the landlord . And having said it he pulled up his apron , put his hands into his pockets , and , taking a step or two outside the door , looked down the dark road with an assumption of great indifference . A glance at the toil - worn face of Smike determined Nicholas , so without any further consideration he made up his mind to stay where he was . The landlord led them into the kitchen , and as there was a good fire he remarked that it was very cold . If there had happened to be a bad one he would have observed that it was very warm . ‘
136330	136337	136324	136324	you	0	’ was Nicholas ’s natural question . ‘
136345	136416	136342	136342	you	0	’ was the landlord ’s no less natural answer . Nicholas suggested cold meat , but there was no cold meat -- poached eggs , but there were no eggs -- mutton chops , but there was n’t a mutton chop within three miles , though there had been more last week than they knew what to do with , and would be an extraordinary supply the day after tomorrow . ‘
136419	136423	136342	136342	you	0	’ said Nicholas , ‘
136447	136448	136442	136442	you	0	’ ‘
136458	136463	136452	136452	I	0	’ rejoined the landlord . ‘
136523	136524	136514	136514	I	0	’ ‘
136529	136536	136514	136514	I	0	’ said Nicholas , detaining him . ‘
136617	136618	136607	136607	I	0	’ ‘
136623	136628	136607	136607	I	0	’ said the landlord , ‘
136640	136641	136643	136643	he	381	’ ‘
136646	136670	136672	136672	he	381	’ asked Nicholas , on whose mind , to tell the truth , the prospect of the savoury pudding was making some impression . ‘
136674	136679	136672	136672	he	381	’ replied the landlord . ‘
136705	136762	136777	136777	he	381	’ The landlord hurried into the parlour , without staying for further permission , nor did Nicholas strive to prevent him : wisely considering that supper , under the circumstances , was too serious a matter to be trifled with . It was not long before the host returned , in a condition of much excitement . ‘
136766	136774	136777	136777	he	381	’ he said in a low voice . ‘
136802	137043	137044	137046	Mr. Vincent Crummles	381	’ There was no time to inquire to what this exclamation , which was delivered in a very rapturous tone , referred ; for he had already thrown open the door of the room ; into which Nicholas , followed by Smike with the bundle on his shoulder ( he carried it about with him as vigilantly as if it had been a sack of gold ) , straightway repaired . Nicholas was prepared for something odd , but not for something quite so odd as the sight he encountered . At the upper end of the room , were a couple of boys , one of them very tall and the other very short , both dressed as sailors -- or at least as theatrical sailors , with belts , buckles , pigtails , and pistols complete -- fighting what is called in play - bills a terrific combat , with two of those short broad - swords with basket hilts which are commonly used at our minor theatres . The short boy had gained a great advantage over the tall boy , who was reduced to mortal strait , and both were overlooked by a large heavy man , perched against the corner of a table , who emphatically adjured them to strike a little more fire out of the swords , and they could n’t fail to bring the house down , on the very first night . ‘
137048	137059	137044	137046	Mr. Vincent Crummles	381	’ said the landlord with an air of great deference . ‘
137066	137105	137062	137064	the young gentleman	1111	’ Mr. Vincent Crummles received Nicholas with an inclination of the head , something between the courtesy of a Roman emperor and the nod of a pot companion ; and bade the landlord shut the door and begone . ‘
137111	137125	137126	137129	The little ‘ un	11326	’ said Mr. Crummles , motioning Nicholas not to advance and spoil it . ‘
137128	137136	137126	137129	The little ‘ un	11326	‘ un has him ; if the big ‘
137159	137560	137157	137157	boys	8645	’ The two combatants went to work afresh , and chopped away until the swords emitted a shower of sparks : to the great satisfaction of Mr Crummles , who appeared to consider this a very great point indeed . The engagement commenced with about two hundred chops administered by the short sailor and the tall sailor alternately , without producing any particular result , until the short sailor was chopped down on one knee ; but this was nothing to him , for he worked himself about on the one knee with the assistance of his left hand , and fought most desperately until the tall sailor chopped his sword out of his grasp . Now , the inference was , that the short sailor , reduced to this extremity , would give in at once and cry quarter , but , instead of that , he all of a sudden drew a large pistol from his belt and presented it at the face of the tall sailor , who was so overcome at this ( not expecting it ) that he let the short sailor pick up his sword and begin again . Then , the chopping recommenced , and a variety of fancy chops were administered on both sides ; such as chops dealt with the left hand , and under the leg , and over the right shoulder , and over the left ; and when the short sailor made a vigorous cut at the tall sailor ’s legs , which would have shaved them clean off if it had taken effect , the tall sailor jumped over the short sailor ’s sword , wherefore to balance the matter , and make it all fair , the tall sailor administered the same cut , and the short sailor jumped over HIS sword . After this , there was a good deal of dodging about , and hitching up of the inexpressibles in the absence of braces , and then the short sailor ( who was the moral character evidently , for he always had the best of it ) made a violent demonstration and closed with the tall sailor , who , after a few unavailing struggles , went down , and expired in great torture as the short sailor put his foot upon his breast , and bored a hole in him through and through . ‘
137574	137579	137572	137572	boys	8645	’ said Mr. Crummles . ‘
137592	137686	137572	137572	boys	8645	’ Having addressed these words to the combatants , he saluted Nicholas , who then observed that the face of Mr. Crummles was quite proportionate in size to his body ; that he had a very full under - lip , a hoarse voice , as though he were in the habit of shouting very much , and very short black hair , shaved off nearly to the crown of his head -- to admit ( as he afterwards learnt ) of his more easily wearing character wigs of any shape or pattern . ‘
137696	137701	137689	137689	you	3387	’ inquired Mr. Crummles . ‘
137709	137713	137689	137689	you	3387	’ answered Nicholas . ‘
137728	137745	137725	137725	I	0	’ said Mr Crummles . Nicholas assented -- observing that if they were a little better match-- ‘
137748	137753	137754	137754	I	0	’ cried Mr. Crummles . ‘
137766	137773	137757	137757	they	3390	’ said Nicholas , explaining himself . ‘
137776	137781	137754	137754	I	0	’ repeated Mr. Crummles ; ‘

137856	137860	137853	137853	I	0	’ replied Nicholas . ‘

137884	137889	137890	137890	I	0	’ said Mr. Crummles . ‘
137901	137917	137900	137900	you	3387	’re going there , look into the theatre , and see how that ’ll tell . ’
138096	138103	138105	138106	the manager	3395	‘ You are going that way ? ’
138108	138113	138115	138115	Nicholas	207	‘ Ye - yes , ’
138117	138123	138115	138115	Nicholas	207	‘ Yes , I am . ’
138124	138133	138135	138136	the manager	3395	‘ Do you know the town at all ? ’
138156	138159	138161	138161	Nicholas	207	‘ No , ’
138163	138167	138161	138161	Nicholas	207	‘ Never there ? ’
138168	138171	138172	138174	Mr. Vincent Crummles	381	‘ Never . ’
138187	138199	138172	138174	Mr. Vincent Crummles	381	‘ If you wo n’t be communicative , you wo n’t ; ’
138272	138278	138280	138281	the manager	3395	‘ Excuse my saying so , ’
138293	138304	138280	138281	the manager	3395	‘ but what a capital countenance your friend has got ! ’
138305	138309	138311	138311	Nicholas	207	‘ Poor fellow ! ’
138319	138333	138311	138311	Nicholas	207	‘ I wish it were a little more plump , and less haggard . ’
138334	138337	138339	138340	the manager	3395	‘ Plump ! ’
138345	138353	138339	138340	the manager	3395	‘ you ’d spoil it for ever . ’
138354	138360	138311	138311	Nicholas	207	‘ Do you think so ? ’
138361	138374	138376	138377	the manager	3395	‘ Think so , sir ! Why , as he is now , ’
138384	138473	138376	138377	the manager	3395	‘ without a pad upon his body , and hardly a touch of paint upon his face , he ’d make such an actor for the starved business as was never seen in this country . Only let him be tolerably well up in the Apothecary in Romeo and Juliet , with the slightest possible dab of red on the tip of his nose , and he ’d be certain of three rounds the moment he put his head out of the practicable door in the front grooves O.P. ’
138474	138483	138485	138485	Nicholas	207	‘ You view him with a professional eye , ’
138489	138495	138497	138498	the manager	3395	‘ And well I may , ’
138500	138536	138497	138498	the manager	3395	‘ I never saw a young fellow so regularly cut out for that line , since I ’ve been in the profession . And I played the heavy children when I was eighteen months old . ’
138748	138753	138755	138757	Mr. Vincent Crummles	381	‘ Let them go , ’
138759	138773	138755	138757	Mr. Vincent Crummles	381	‘ and we ’ll have it snugly and cosily together by the fire . ’
139029	139036	139038	139039	Mr. Crummles	381	‘ Why , so I saw , ’

139054	139105	139038	139039	Mr. Crummles	381	’ Nicholas could not refrain from smiling at the abruptness of the question ; but , thinking it scarcely worth while to parry it , owned that he was under some apprehensions lest he might not succeed in the object which had brought him to that part of the country . ‘
139111	139116	139038	139039	Mr. Crummles	381	’ asked the manager . ‘
139138	139142	139038	139039	Mr. Crummles	381	’ said Nicholas . ‘

139418	139438	139415	139415	you	3427	’ asked Nicholas , alarmed by this prediction , and the confident tone in which it had been uttered . ‘
139454	139462	139463	139463	They	8646	’ Mr. Vincent Crummles nodded his head . ‘
139479	139499	139474	139477	young gentlemen like you	3430	’ There was a pause . The countenance of Nicholas fell , and he gazed ruefully at the fire . ‘
139530	139535	139474	139477	young gentlemen like you	3430	’ asked the manager . ‘
139538	139546	139474	139477	young gentlemen like you	3430	’ said Nicholas , shaking his head . ‘

140936	140940	140920	140920	he	0	’ cried Nicholas . ‘
140949	140954	140920	140920	he	0	’ said the manager ; ‘
140986	141048	141049	141049	We	3467	’ The descendant of this ill - starred animal requiring increased attention from Mr. Crummles as he progressed in his day ’s work , that gentleman had very little time for conversation . Nicholas was thus left at leisure to entertain himself with his own thoughts , until they arrived at the drawbridge at Portsmouth , when Mr. Crummles pulled up . ‘
141055	141060	141049	141049	We	3467	’ said the manager , ‘
141094	141271	141081	141081	You	3471	’ Thanking Mr. Vincent Crummles for his obliging offer , Nicholas jumped out , and , giving Smike his arm , accompanied the manager up High Street on their way to the theatre ; feeling nervous and uncomfortable enough at the prospect of an immediate introduction to a scene so new to him . They passed a great many bills , pasted against the walls and displayed in windows , wherein the names of Mr. Vincent Crummles , Mrs. Vincent Crummles , Master Crummles , Master P. Crummles , and Miss Crummles , were printed in very large letters , and everything else in very small ones ; and , turning at length into an entry , in which was a strong smell of orange - peel and lamp - oil , with an under - current of sawdust , groped their way through a dark passage , and , descending a step or two , threaded a little maze of canvas screens and paint pots , and emerged upon the stage of the Portsmouth Theatre . ‘
141276	141351	141081	141081	You	3471	’ said Mr. Crummles . It was not very light , but Nicholas found himself close to the first entrance on the prompt side , among bare walls , dusty scenes , mildewed clouds , heavily daubed draperies , and dirty floors . He looked about him ; ceiling , pit , boxes , gallery , orchestra , fittings , and decorations of every kind,--all looked coarse , cold , gloomy , and wretched . ‘
141357	141364	141365	141365	I	0	’ whispered Smike , in amazement ; ‘
141376	141377	141365	141365	I	0	’ ‘
141384	141392	141365	141365	I	0	’ replied Nicholas , hardly less surprised ; ‘
141404	141495	141496	141497	Mr. Johnson	340	’ The manager ’s voice recalled him from a more careful inspection of the building , to the opposite side of the proscenium , where , at a small mahogany table with rickety legs and of an oblong shape , sat a stout , portly female , apparently between forty and fifty , in a tarnished silk cloak , with her bonnet dangling by the strings in her hand , and her hair ( of which she had a great quantity ) braided in a large festoon over each temple . ‘
141499	141525	141496	141497	Mr. Johnson	340	’ said the manager ( for Nicholas had given the name which Newman Noggs had bestowed upon him in his conversation with Mrs Kenwigs ) , ‘
141533	141534	141535	141535	I	0	’ ‘
141544	141555	141542	141542	sir	714	’ said Mrs. Vincent Crummles , in a sepulchral voice . ‘
141579	141620	141556	141556	I	0	’ The lady shook Nicholas by the hand as she addressed him in these terms ; he saw it was a large one , but had not expected quite such an iron grip as that with which she honoured him . ‘
141624	141644	141556	141556	I	0	’ said the lady , crossing to Smike , as tragic actresses cross when they obey a stage direction , ‘
141659	141660	141661	141661	He	3480	’ ‘
141671	141682	141661	141661	He	3480	’ said the manager , taking a pinch of snuff . ‘
141687	141692	141683	141683	He	3480	’ replied the lady . ‘
141697	141828	141829	141829	They	3482	’ As Mrs. Vincent Crummles recrossed back to the table , there bounded on to the stage from some mysterious inlet , a little girl in a dirty white frock with tucks up to the knees , short trousers , sandaled shoes , white spencer , pink gauze bonnet , green veil and curl papers ; who turned a pirouette , cut twice in the air , turned another pirouette , then , looking off at the opposite wing , shrieked , bounded forward to within six inches of the footlights , and fell into a beautiful attitude of terror , as a shabby gentleman in an old pair of buff slippers came in at one powerful slide , and chattering his teeth , fiercely brandished a walking - stick . ‘
141840	141845	141829	141829	They	3482	’ said Mrs Crummles . ‘
141848	141853	141854	141857	the little ballet interlude	3484	’ said the manager , ‘
141883	142292	141871	141871	you	340	’ The manager clapped his hands as a signal to proceed , and the savage , becoming ferocious , made a slide towards the maiden ; but the maiden avoided him in six twirls , and came down , at the end of the last one , upon the very points of her toes . This seemed to make some impression upon the savage ; for , after a little more ferocity and chasing of the maiden into corners , he began to relent , and stroked his face several times with his right thumb and four fingers , thereby intimating that he was struck with admiration of the maiden ’s beauty . Acting upon the impulse of this passion , he ( the savage ) began to hit himself severe thumps in the chest , and to exhibit other indications of being desperately in love , which being rather a prosy proceeding , was very likely the cause of the maiden ’s falling asleep ; whether it was or no , asleep she did fall , sound as a church , on a sloping bank , and the savage perceiving it , leant his left ear on his left hand , and nodded sideways , to intimate to all whom it might concern that she WAS asleep , and no shamming . Being left to himself , the savage had a dance , all alone . Just as he left off , the maiden woke up , rubbed her eyes , got off the bank , and had a dance all alone too -- such a dance that the savage looked on in ecstasy all the while , and when it was done , plucked from a neighbouring tree some botanical curiosity , resembling a small pickled cabbage , and offered it to the maiden , who at first would n’t have it , but on the savage shedding tears relented . Then the savage jumped for joy ; then the maiden jumped for rapture at the sweet smell of the pickled cabbage . Then the savage and the maiden danced violently together , and , finally , the savage dropped down on one knee , and the maiden stood on one leg upon his other knee ; thus concluding the ballet , and leaving the spectators in a state of pleasing uncertainty , whether she would ultimately marry the savage , or return to her friends . ‘
142297	142302	141871	141871	you	340	’ said Mr. Crummles ; ‘
142305	142306	141871	141871	you	340	’ ‘
142309	142321	141871	141871	you	340	’ cried Nicholas , resolved to make the best of everything . ‘
142324	142325	142328	142328	sir	714	’ ‘
142330	142341	142328	142328	sir	714	’ said Mr. Vincent Crummles , bringing the maiden forward , ‘
142352	142353	142354	142355	Your daughter	8727	’ ‘
142357	142361	142362	142363	My daughter	11202	’ inquired Nicholas . ‘
142368	142374	142365	142366	my daughter	11202	’ replied Mr. Vincent Crummles ; ‘

142418	142422	142411	142411	I	0	’ said Nicholas ; ‘

142436	142452	142453	142453	I	0	’ Mr. Crummles stopped : language was not powerful enough to describe the infant phenomenon . ‘
142461	142465	142453	142453	I	0	’ he said ; ‘
142503	142504	142497	142498	your mother	935	’ ‘
142513	142517	142506	142506	I	0	’ inquired Nicholas . ‘
142523	142556	142518	142518	You	714	’ replied Mr. Crummles , looking steadily in his questioner ’s face , as some men do when they have doubts about being implicitly believed in what they are going to say . ‘
142566	142567	142557	142557	She	3499	’ ‘
142571	142572	142557	142557	She	3499	’ ‘

142582	142586	142580	142580	me	0	’ said Nicholas , ‘
142591	142749	142580	142580	me	0	’ It was ; for the infant phenomenon , though of short stature , had a comparatively aged countenance , and had moreover been precisely the same age -- not perhaps to the full extent of the memory of the oldest inhabitant , but certainly for five good years . But she had been kept up late every night , and put upon an unlimited allowance of gin - and - water from infancy , to prevent her growing tall , and perhaps this system of training had produced in the infant phenomenon these additional phenomena . While this short dialogue was going on , the gentleman who had enacted the savage , came up , with his walking shoes on his feet , and his slippers in his hand , to within a few paces , as if desirous to join in the conversation . Deeming this a good opportunity , he put in his word . ‘
142755	142768	142753	142753	sir	714	’ said the savage , nodding towards Miss Crummles . Nicholas assented . ‘
142771	142791	142753	142753	sir	714	’ said the actor , setting his teeth together , and drawing in his breath with a hissing sound , ‘
142805	142806	142809	142809	you	714	’ ‘
142812	142817	142809	142809	you	714	’ asked the manager . ‘
142823	142830	142818	142818	I	0	’ replied the other , warmly , ‘

142905	142915	142891	142891	you	714	’ said the manager , presenting him to Nicholas . ‘

142973	142992	142962	142962	you	714	’ whispered the actor , drawing him away , as Crummles left them to speak to his wife . ‘
142996	143014	143015	143015	You	714	’ Mr. Folair made a funny face from his pantomime collection , and pointed over his shoulder . ‘

143030	143035	143028	143028	sir	714	’ replied Mr. Folair . ‘

His age did not appear to exceed thirty , though many at first sight would have considered him much older , as his face was long , and very pale , from the constant application of stage paint . He wore a checked shirt , an old green coat with new gilt buttons , a neckerchief of broad red and green stripes , and full blue trousers ; he carried , too , a common ash walking - stick , apparently more for show than use , as he flourished it about , with the hooked end downwards , except when he raised it for a few seconds , and throwing himself into a fencing attitude , made a pass or two at the side - scenes , or at any other object , animate or inanimate , that chanced to afford him a pretty good mark at the moment . ‘
143578	143598	143365	143366	old fellow	10977	’ said this gentleman , making a thrust at his friend , who parried it dexterously with his slipper , ‘

144840	144845	144792	144792	you	207	’ said Miss Snevellicci . ‘

146161	146180	146182	146183	Mr. Crummles	381	‘ Most audiences are , when they have good acting -- real good acting -- the regular thing , ’

146199	146203	146205	146206	Mrs. Crummles	386	‘ I do , ’
146208	146218	146205	146206	Mrs. Crummles	386	‘ There is no teaching here , I suppose ? ’
146219	146224	146226	146227	Mrs. Crummles	386	‘ There has been , ’
146229	146247	146226	146227	Mrs. Crummles	386	‘ I have received pupils here . I imparted tuition to the daughter of a dealer in ships ’
146278	146296	146255	146255	she	3610	’ Not feeling quite so sure of that , Nicholas thought it best to hold his peace . ‘
146301	146309	146255	146255	she	3610	’ said the manager cogitating after dinner . ‘
146321	146322	146311	146311	you	207	’ ‘
146328	146333	146311	146311	you	207	’ replied Nicholas hastily ; ‘

146403	146425	146385	146385	you	207	’ replied Nicholas : devoutly hoping that it would be a very long time before he was honoured with this distinction . ‘
146436	146441	146427	146427	I	0	’ said Mr. Crummles . ‘
146525	146715	146502	146502	You	207	’ With these hasty general directions Mr. Crummles thrust a number of little books into the faltering hands of Nicholas , and bidding his eldest son go with him and show where lodgings were to be had , shook him by the hand , and wished him good night . There is no lack of comfortable furnished apartments in Portsmouth , and no difficulty in finding some that are proportionate to very slender finances ; but the former were too good , and the latter too bad , and they went into so many houses , and came out unsuited , that Nicholas seriously began to think he should be obliged to ask permission to spend the night in the theatre , after all . Eventually , however , they stumbled upon two small rooms up three pair of stairs , or rather two pair and a ladder , at a tobacconist ’s shop , on the Common Hard : a dirty street leading down to the dockyard . These Nicholas engaged , only too happy to have escaped any request for payment of a week ’s rent beforehand . ‘
146726	146736	146724	146724	Smike	264	’ he said , after showing young Crummles downstairs . ‘

147620	147625	147626	147626	Gadzooks	408	’ reasoned Mr. Lenville . ‘

147897	147902	147903	147905	The distressed lady	3639	’ replied Mr. Folair . ‘
147928	148285	147921	147921	you	409	’ Profiting by these and other lessons , which were the result of the personal experience of the two actors , Nicholas willingly gave them the best breakfast he could , and , when he at length got rid of them , applied himself to his task : by no means displeased to find that it was so much easier than he had at first supposed . He worked very hard all day , and did not leave his room until the evening , when he went down to the theatre , whither Smike had repaired before him to go on with another gentleman as a general rebellion . Here all the people were so much changed , that he scarcely knew them . False hair , false colour , false calves , false muscles -- they had become different beings . Mr. Lenville was a blooming warrior of most exquisite proportions ; Mr. Crummles , his large face shaded by a profusion of black hair , a Highland outlaw of most majestic bearing ; one of the old gentlemen a jailer , and the other a venerable patriarch ; the comic countryman , a fighting - man of great valour , relieved by a touch of humour ; each of the Master Crummleses a prince in his own right ; and the low - spirited lover , a desponding captive . There was a gorgeous banquet ready spread for the third act , consisting of two pasteboard vases , one plate of biscuits , a black bottle , and a vinegar cruet ; and , in short , everything was on a scale of the utmost splendour and preparation . Nicholas was standing with his back to the curtain , now contemplating the first scene , which was a Gothic archway , about two feet shorter than Mr. Crummles , through which that gentleman was to make his first entrance , and now listening to a couple of people who were cracking nuts in the gallery , wondering whether they made the whole audience , when the manager himself walked familiarly up and accosted him . ‘
148291	148296	147921	147921	you	409	’ said Mr. Crummles . ‘
148299	148303	147921	147921	you	409	’ replied Nicholas , ‘

148325	148330	148317	148317	We	3661	’ said Mr. Crummles . ‘

148353	148357	148317	148317	We	3661	’ said Nicholas ; ‘

148368	148373	148361	148361	I	0	’ replied Mr. Crummles , ‘
148396	148475	148388	148388	they	9015	’ It would have been difficult for any party , family , or otherwise , to have visited the theatre on a night when the phenomenon did NOT play , inasmuch as she always sustained one , and not uncommonly two or three , characters , every night ; but Nicholas , sympathising with the feelings of a father , refrained from hinting at this trifling circumstance , and Mr Crummles continued to talk , uninterrupted by him . ‘
148478	148483	148484	148484	pa	11468	’ said that gentleman ; ‘
148558	148559	148560	148560	I	0	’ ‘
148567	148571	148560	148560	I	0	’ observed Nicholas . ‘
148579	148584	148560	148560	I	0	’ replied Mr. Crummles ; ‘
148624	149055	148622	148622	Grudden	401	’ That useful lady did as she was requested , and shortly afterwards the tuning of three fiddles was heard . Which process having been protracted as long as it was supposed that the patience of the audience could possibly bear it , was put a stop to by another jerk of the bell , which , being the signal to begin in earnest , set the orchestra playing a variety of popular airs , with involuntary variations . If Nicholas had been astonished at the alteration for the better which the gentlemen displayed , the transformation of the ladies was still more extraordinary . When , from a snug corner of the manager ’s box , he beheld Miss Snevellicci in all the glories of white muslin with a golden hem , and Mrs. Crummles in all the dignity of the outlaw ’s wife , and Miss Bravassa in all the sweetness of Miss Snevellicci ’s confidential friend , and Miss Belvawney in the white silks of a page doing duty everywhere and swearing to live and die in the service of everybody , he could scarcely contain his admiration , which testified itself in great applause , and the closest possible attention to the business of the scene . The plot was most interesting . It belonged to no particular age , people , or country , and was perhaps the more delightful on that account , as nobody ’s previous information could afford the remotest glimmering of what would ever come of it . An outlaw had been very successful in doing something somewhere , and came home , in triumph , to the sound of shouts and fiddles , to greet his wife -- a lady of masculine mind , who talked a good deal about her father ’s bones , which it seemed were unburied , though whether from a peculiar taste on the part of the old gentleman himself , or the reprehensible neglect of his relations , did not appear . This outlaw ’s wife was , somehow or other , mixed up with a patriarch , living in a castle a long way off , and this patriarch was the father of several of the characters , but he did n’t exactly know which , and was uncertain whether he had brought up the right ones in his castle , or the wrong ones ; he rather inclined to the latter opinion , and , being uneasy , relieved his mind with a banquet , during which solemnity somebody in a cloak said ‘
149058	149422	148622	148622	Grudden	401	’ which somebody was known by nobody ( except the audience ) to be the outlaw himself , who had come there , for reasons unexplained , but possibly with an eye to the spoons . There was an agreeable little surprise in the way of certain love passages between the desponding captive and Miss Snevellicci , and the comic fighting - man and Miss Bravassa ; besides which , Mr. Lenville had several very tragic scenes in the dark , while on throat - cutting expeditions , which were all baffled by the skill and bravery of the comic fighting - man ( who overheard whatever was said all through the piece ) and the intrepidity of Miss Snevellicci , who adopted tights , and therein repaired to the prison of her captive lover , with a small basket of refreshments and a dark lantern . At last , it came out that the patriarch was the man who had treated the bones of the outlaw ’s father - in - law with so much disrespect , for which cause and reason the outlaw ’s wife repaired to his castle to kill him , and so got into a dark room , where , after a good deal of groping in the dark , everybody got hold of everybody else , and took them for somebody besides , which occasioned a vast quantity of confusion , with some pistolling , loss of life , and torchlight ; after which , the patriarch came forward , and observing , with a knowing look , that he knew all about his children now , and would tell them when they got inside , said that there could not be a more appropriate occasion for marrying the young people than that ; and therefore he joined their hands , with the full consent of the indefatigable page , who ( being the only other person surviving ) pointed with his cap into the clouds , and his right hand to the ground ; thereby invoking a blessing and giving the cue for the curtain to come down , which it did , amidst general applause . ‘
149430	149461	149425	149425	you	3674	’ asked Mr. Crummles , when Nicholas went round to the stage again . Mr. Crummles was very red and hot , for your outlaws are desperate fellows to shout . ‘
149470	149474	149425	149425	you	3674	’ replied Nicholas ; ‘

149939	149948	149931	149937	one or two of the principal people	3691	’ murmured the manager in a persuasive tone . ‘
149953	149965	149931	149937	one or two of the principal people	3691	’ said Nicholas , with an air of very strong objection , ‘

150380	150562	150377	150377	I	0	’ Miss Snevellicci was at once overwhelmed with blushes and expressions of gratitude , of which latter commodity neither Mr. nor Mrs. Crummles was by any means sparing . It was arranged that Nicholas should call upon her , at her lodgings , at eleven next morning , and soon after they parted : he to return home to his authorship : Miss Snevellicci to dress for the after - piece : and the disinterested manager and his wife to discuss the probable gains of the forthcoming bespeak , of which they were to have two - thirds of the profits by solemn treaty of agreement . At the stipulated hour next morning , Nicholas repaired to the lodgings of Miss Snevellicci , which were in a place called Lombard Street , at the house of a tailor . A strong smell of ironing pervaded the little passage ; and the tailor ’s daughter , who opened the door , appeared in that flutter of spirits which is so often attendant upon the periodical getting up of a family ’s linen . ‘
150571	150590	150563	150564	Miss Snevellicci	394	’ said Nicholas , when the door was opened . The tailor ’s daughter replied in the affirmative . ‘

151311	151428	151282	151282	her	394	’ , in large capitals , formed the principal contents of Miss Snevellicci ’s scrapbook . Nicholas had read a great many of these scraps , and was absorbed in a circumstantial and melancholy account of the train of events which had led to Miss Snevellicci ’s spraining her ankle by slipping on a piece of orange - peel flung by a monster in human form , ( so the paper said , ) upon the stage at Winchester,--when that young lady herself , attired in the coal - scuttle bonnet and walking - dress complete , tripped into the room , with a thousand apologies for having detained him so long after the appointed time . ‘

152269	152292	152294	152295	Miss Snevellicci	394	‘ I venture to call , for the purpose of asking whether you would put your name to my bespeak , ma’am , ’
152300	152312	152314	152315	Mrs. Curdle	413	‘ Oh ! I really do n’t know what to say , ’
152317	152349	152314	152315	Mrs. Curdle	413	‘ It ’s not as if the theatre was in its high and palmy days -- you need n’t stand , Miss Snevellicci -- the drama is gone , perfectly gone . ’
152350	152397	152399	152400	Mr. Curdle	414	‘ As an exquisite embodiment of the poet ’s visions , and a realisation of human intellectuality , gilding with refulgent light our dreamy moments , and laying open a new and magic world before the mental eye , the drama is gone , perfectly gone , ’
152402	152431	152433	152434	Mrs. Curdle	413	‘ What man is there , now living , who can present before us all those changing and prismatic colours with which the character of Hamlet is invested ? ’

152459	152473	152457	152457	himself	414	‘ Hamlet ! Pooh ! ridiculous ! Hamlet is gone , perfectly gone . ’
152515	152521	152523	152524	Miss Snevellicci	394	‘ Quite a new one , ’
152526	152557	152523	152524	Miss Snevellicci	394	‘ of which this gentleman is the author , and in which he plays ; being his first appearance on any stage . Mr. Johnson is the gentleman ’s name . ’
152558	152569	152571	152572	Mr. Curdle	414	‘ I hope you have preserved the unities , sir ? ’
152574	152583	152585	152585	Nicholas	207	‘ The original piece is a French one , ’
152587	152601	152585	152585	Nicholas	207	‘ There is abundance of incident , sprightly dialogue , strongly - marked characters-- ’
152602	152615	152617	152618	Mr. Curdle	414	‘ --All unavailing without a strict observance of the unities , sir , ’
152620	152630	152617	152618	Mr. Curdle	414	‘ The unities of the drama , before everything . ’
152631	152637	152639	152639	Nicholas	207	‘ Might I ask you , ’
152657	152667	152651	152651	his	414	‘ might I ask you what the unities are ? ’

152684	152766	152768	152769	Mr. Curdle	414	‘ are a completeness -- a kind of universal dovetailedness with regard to place and time -- a sort of a general oneness , if I may be allowed to use so strong an expression . I take those to be the dramatic unities , so far as I have been enabled to bestow attention upon them , and I have read much upon the subject , and thought much . I find , running through the performances of this child , ’
152776	152833	152768	152769	Mr. Curdle	414	‘ a unity of feeling , a breadth , a light and shade , a warmth of colouring , a tone , a harmony , a glow , an artistical development of original conceptions , which I look for , in vain , among older performers -- I do n’t know whether I make myself understood ? ’
152834	152837	152839	152839	Nicholas	207	‘ Perfectly , ’
152841	152845	152847	152848	Mr. Curdle	414	‘ Just so , ’
152855	152867	152847	152848	Mr. Curdle	414	‘ That is my definition of the unities of the drama . ’
152898	152915	152917	152918	Mr. Curdle	414	‘ I do n’t know , my dear ; upon my word I do n’t know , ’
152920	153034	153036	153037	Mr. Curdle	414	‘ If we do , it must be distinctly understood that we do not pledge ourselves to the quality of the performances . Let it go forth to the world , that we do not give THEM the sanction of our names , but that we confer the distinction merely upon Miss Snevellicci . That being clearly stated , I take it to be , as it were , a duty , that we should extend our patronage to a degraded stage , even for the sake of the associations with which it is entwined . Have you got two - and - sixpence for half - a - crown , Miss Snevellicci ? ’
153098	153103	153105	153106	Mr. Curdle	414	‘ Let me see , ’
153108	153167	153105	153106	Mr. Curdle	414	‘ twice four ’s eight -- four shillings a - piece to the boxes , Miss Snevellicci , is exceedingly dear in the present state of the drama -- three half - crowns is seven - and - six ; we shall not differ about sixpence , I suppose ? Sixpence will not part us , Miss Snevellicci ? ’
153230	153235	153237	153237	Nicholas	207	‘ Odd people those , ’
153247	153252	153254	153255	Miss Snevellicci	394	‘ I assure you , ’
153261	153322	153254	153255	Miss Snevellicci	394	‘ that I think myself very lucky they did not owe all the money instead of being sixpence short . Now , if you were to succeed , they would give people to understand that they had always patronised you ; and if you were to fail , they would have been quite certain of that from the very beginning . ’

153520	153561	153512	153513	the mama	3776	‘ I can not think of allowing you to go , without first taking a glass of wine . Fie , Charlotte , I am ashamed of you ! Miss Lane , my dear , pray see to the children . ’
153610	153625	153630	153631	Mrs. Borum	424	‘ I am sure , where you ever learnt to act as you do , ’
153639	153674	153630	153631	Mrs. Borum	424	‘ I can not understand ( Emma , do n’t stare so ) ; laughing in one piece , and crying in the next , and so natural in all -- oh , dear ! ’
153675	153689	153691	153692	Miss Snevellicci	394	‘ I am very happy to hear you express so favourable an opinion , ’
153694	153705	153691	153692	Miss Snevellicci	394	‘ It ’s quite delightful to think you like it . ’
153706	153710	153712	153713	Mrs. Borum	424	‘ Like it ! ’
153715	153743	153712	153713	Mrs. Borum	424	‘ Who can help liking it ? I would go to the play , twice a week if I could : I dote upon it -- only you ’re
153781	154475	153772	153772	you	422	’ The phenomenon was really in a fair way of being torn limb from limb ; for two strong little boys , one holding on by each of her hands , were dragging her in different directions as a trial of strength . However , Miss Lane ( who had herself been too much occupied in contemplating the grown - up actors , to pay the necessary attention to these proceedings ) rescued the unhappy infant at this juncture , who , being recruited with a glass of wine , was shortly afterwards taken away by her friends , after sustaining no more serious damage than a flattening of the pink gauze bonnet , and a rather extensive creasing of the white frock and trousers . It was a trying morning ; for there were a great many calls to make , and everybody wanted a different thing . Some wanted tragedies , and others comedies ; some objected to dancing ; some wanted scarcely anything else . Some thought the comic singer decidedly low , and others hoped he would have more to do than he usually had . Some people would n’t promise to go , because other people would n’t promise to go ; and other people would n’t go at all , because other people went . At length , and by little and little , omitting something in this place , and adding something in that , Miss Snevellicci pledged herself to a bill of fare which was comprehensive enough , if it had no other merit ( it included among other trifles , four pieces , divers songs , a few combats , and several dances ) ; and they returned home , pretty well exhausted with the business of the day . Nicholas worked away at the piece , which was speedily put into rehearsal , and then worked away at his own part , which he studied with great perseverance and acted -- as the whole company said -- to perfection . And at length the great day arrived . The crier was sent round , in the morning , to proclaim the entertainments with the sound of bell in all the thoroughfares ; and extra bills of three feet long by nine inches wide , were dispersed in all directions , flung down all the areas , thrust under all the knockers , and developed in all the shops . They were placarded on all the walls too , though not with complete success , for an illiterate person having undertaken this office during the indisposition of the regular bill - sticker , a part were posted sideways , and the remainder upside down . At half - past five , there was a rush of four people to the gallery - door ; at a quarter before six , there were at least a dozen ; at six o’clock the kicks were terrific ; and when the elder Master Crummles opened the door , he was obliged to run behind it for his life . Fifteen shillings were taken by Mrs. Grudden in the first ten minutes . Behind the scenes , the same unwonted excitement prevailed . Miss Snevellicci was in such a perspiration that the paint would scarcely stay on her face . Mrs. Crummles was so nervous that she could hardly remember her part . Miss Bravassa ’s ringlets came out of curl with the heat and anxiety ; even Mr. Crummles himself kept peeping through the hole in the curtain , and running back , every now and then , to announce that another man had come into the pit . At last , the orchestra left off , and the curtain rose upon the new piece . The first scene , in which there was nobody particular , passed off calmly enough , but when Miss Snevellicci went on in the second , accompanied by the phenomenon as child , what a roar of applause broke out ! The people in the Borum box rose as one man , waving their hats and handkerchiefs , and uttering shouts of ‘
154478	154684	154685	154686	presumptuous boy	3782	’ Mrs. Borum and the governess cast wreaths upon the stage , of which , some fluttered into the lamps , and one crowned the temples of a fat gentleman in the pit , who , looking eagerly towards the scene , remained unconscious of the honour ; the tailor and his family kicked at the panels of the upper boxes till they threatened to come out altogether ; the very ginger - beer boy remained transfixed in the centre of the house ; a young officer , supposed to entertain a passion for Miss Snevellicci , stuck his glass in his eye as though to hide a tear . Again and again Miss Snevellicci curtseyed lower and lower , and again and again the applause came down , louder and louder . At length , when the phenomenon picked up one of the smoking wreaths and put it on , sideways , over Miss Snevellicci ’s eye , it reached its climax , and the play proceeded . But when Nicholas came on for his crack scene with Mrs. Crummles , what a clapping of hands there was ! When Mrs. Crummles ( who was his unworthy mother ) , sneered , and called him ‘
154688	155222	154685	154686	presumptuous boy	3782	’ and he defied her , what a tumult of applause came on ! When he quarrelled with the other gentleman about the young lady , and producing a case of pistols , said , that if he WAS a gentleman , he would fight him in that drawing - room , until the furniture was sprinkled with the blood of one , if not of two -- how boxes , pit , and gallery , joined in one most vigorous cheer ! When he called his mother names , because she would n’t give up the young lady ’s property , and she relenting , caused him to relent likewise , and fall down on one knee and ask her blessing , how the ladies in the audience sobbed ! When he was hid behind the curtain in the dark , and the wicked relation poked a sharp sword in every direction , save where his legs were plainly visible , what a thrill of anxious fear ran through the house ! His air , his figure , his walk , his look , everything he said or did , was the subject of commendation . There was a round of applause every time he spoke . And when , at last , in the pump - and - tub scene , Mrs Grudden lighted the blue fire , and all the unemployed members of the company came in , and tumbled down in various directions -- not because that had anything to do with the plot , but in order to finish off with a tableau -- the audience ( who had by this time increased considerably ) gave vent to such a shout of enthusiasm as had not been heard in those walls for many and many a day . In short , the success both of new piece and new actor was complete , and when Miss Snevellicci was called for at the end of the play , Nicholas led her on , and divided the applause . CHAPTER 25 Concerning a young Lady from London , who joins the Company , and an elderly Admirer who follows in her Train ; with an affecting Ceremony consequent on their Arrival The new piece being a decided hit , was announced for every evening of performance until further notice , and the evenings when the theatre was closed , were reduced from three in the week to two . Nor were these the only tokens of extraordinary success ; for , on the succeeding Saturday , Nicholas received , by favour of the indefatigable Mrs. Grudden , no less a sum than thirty shillings ; besides which substantial reward , he enjoyed considerable fame and honour : having a presentation copy of Mr. Curdle ’s pamphlet forwarded to the theatre , with that gentleman ’s own autograph ( in itself an inestimable treasure ) on the fly - leaf , accompanied with a note , containing many expressions of approval , and an unsolicited assurance that Mr. Curdle would be very happy to read Shakespeare to him for three hours every morning before breakfast during his stay in the town . ‘

156913	156922	156910	156911	Mr. Lillyvick	316	‘ Absorbing , fairy - like , toomultuous , ’
156938	156941	156943	156943	Nicholas	207	‘ Ah ! ’
156955	156964	156943	156943	Nicholas	207	‘ Yes -- she is a clever girl . ’
156965	156971	156973	156974	Mr. Lillyvick	316	‘ She is a divinity , ’
156992	157073	156973	156974	Mr. Lillyvick	316	‘ I have known divine actresses before now , sir , I used to collect -- at least I used to CALL for -- and very often call for -- the water - rate at the house of a divine actress , who lived in my beat for upwards of four year but never -- no , never , sir of all divine creatures , actresses or no actresses , did I see a diviner one than is Henrietta Petowker . ’
157105	157116	157118	157119	Mr. Lillyvick	316	‘ Let me speak a word with you in private , ’
157137	157147	157149	157150	Mr. Lillyvick	316	‘ A bachelor is a miserable wretch , sir , ’
157152	157156	157158	157158	Nicholas	207	‘ Is he ? ’
157160	157164	157166	157167	the collector	10290	‘ He is , ’
157169	157190	157166	157167	the collector	10290	‘ I have lived in the world for nigh sixty year , and I ought to know what it is . ’
157191	157199	157201	157201	Nicholas	207	‘ You OUGHT to know , certainly , ’
157203	157215	157201	157201	Nicholas	207	‘ but whether you do or not , is another question . ’
157216	157230	157232	157233	Mr Lillyvick	316	‘ If a bachelor happens to have saved a little matter of money , ’
157235	157331	157232	157233	Mr Lillyvick	316	‘ his sisters and brothers , and nephews and nieces , look TO that money , and not to him ; even if , by being a public character , he is the head of the family , or , as it may be , the main from which all the other little branches are turned on , they still wish him dead all the while , and get low - spirited every time they see him looking in good health , because they want to come into his little property . You see that ? ’
157332	157336	157338	157338	Nicholas	207	‘ Oh yes , ’
157340	157349	157338	157338	Nicholas	207	‘ it ’s very true , no doubt . ’
157350	157359	157361	157362	Mr. Lillyvick	316	‘ The great reason for not being married , ’
157364	157382	157384	157385	Mr. Lillyvick	316	‘ is the expense ; that ’s what ’s kept me off , or else -- Lord ! ’
157391	157399	157388	157388	his	3831	‘ I might have had fifty women . ’
157400	157404	157406	157406	Nicholas	207	‘ Fine women ? ’
157408	157414	157416	157417	the collector	10290	‘ Fine women , sir ! ’
157419	157472	157416	157417	the collector	10290	‘ ay ! not so fine as Henrietta Petowker , for she is an uncommon specimen , but such women as do n’t fall into every man ’s way , I can tell you . Now suppose a man can get a fortune IN a wife instead of with her -- eh ? ’
157473	157484	157486	157486	Nicholas	207	‘ Why , then , he ’s a lucky fellow , ’
157488	157495	157497	157498	the collector	10290	‘ That ’s what I say , ’
157513	157537	157497	157498	the collector	10290	‘ just what I say . Henrietta Petowker , the talented Henrietta Petowker has a fortune in herself , and I am going to-- ’
157538	157545	157547	157547	Nicholas	207	‘ To make her Mrs. Lillyvick ? ’
157549	157561	157563	157564	the collector	10290	‘ No , sir , not to make her Mrs. Lillyvick , ’
157566	157585	157563	157564	the collector	10290	‘ Actresses , sir , always keep their maiden names -- that ’s the regular thing -- but I ’m
157599	157600	157601	157601	I	0	’ ‘
157607	157611	157601	157601	I	0	’ said Nicholas . ‘
157617	157626	157615	157615	sir	714	’ replied the collector , buttoning his waistcoat . ‘
157662	157663	157665	157665	you	10290	’ ‘
157676	157680	157665	157665	you	10290	’ observed Nicholas . ‘
157683	157693	157665	157665	you	10290	’ replied Mr. Lillyvick , shaking his head nervously : ‘
157700	157701	157665	157665	you	10290	’ ‘
157711	157720	157722	157722	Nicholas	207	’re going to be married , Mr Lillyvick ? ’
157724	157737	157722	157722	Nicholas	207	‘ Why , that ’s what I came to explain to you , ’
157746	157764	157722	157722	Nicholas	207	‘ The fact is , we have thought it best to keep it secret from the family . ’
157765	157768	157770	157770	Nicholas	207	‘ Family ! ’
157772	157776	157770	157770	Nicholas	207	‘ What family ? ’
157777	157783	157785	157786	Mr. Lillyvick	316	‘ The Kenwigses of course , ’
157788	157822	157785	157786	Mr. Lillyvick	316	‘ If my niece and the children had known a word about it before I came away , they ’d have gone into fits at my feet , and never have come out of ‘
157850	157861	157835	157835	they	3841	’ said the collector , quite trembling as he spoke . ‘
157866	157870	157873	157873	they	3841	’ said Nicholas . ‘
157882	157883	157873	157873	they	3841	’ ‘
157888	157893	157873	157873	they	3841	’ said Mr. Lillyvick , ‘
157990	158023	158025	158026	the collector	10290	’ lodgings , and shall be delighted to see you -- either before church or at breakfast - time , which you like . It wo n’t be expensive , you know , ’
158038	158060	158025	158026	the collector	10290	‘ just muffins and coffee , with perhaps a shrimp or something of that sort for a relish , you know . ’
158061	158069	158071	158071	Nicholas	207	‘ Yes , yes , I understand , ’
158073	158102	158071	158071	Nicholas	207	‘ Oh , I shall be most happy to come ; it will give me the greatest pleasure . Where ’s the lady stopping -- with Mrs. Crummles ? ’
158103	158108	158110	158111	the collector	10290	‘ Why , no , ’
158113	158148	158110	158111	the collector	10290	‘ they could n’t very well dispose of her at night , and so she is staying with an acquaintance of hers , and another young lady ; they both belong to the theatre . ’
158149	158156	158158	158158	Nicholas	207	‘ Miss Snevellicci , I suppose ? ’
158160	158168	158158	158158	Nicholas	207	‘ Yes , that ’s the name . ’
158169	158179	158181	158181	Nicholas	207	‘ And they ’ll be bridesmaids , I presume ? ’
158183	158186	158188	158189	the collector	10290	‘ Why , ’
158196	158204	158188	158189	the collector	10290	‘ they WILL have four bridesmaids ; I ’m
158213	158214	158206	158206	they	3850	’ ‘
158222	158238	158206	158206	they	3850	’ replied Nicholas , with an awkward attempt to convert a laugh into a cough . ‘
158252	158253	158250	158251	Miss Ledrook--	3852	’ ‘
158259	158264	158250	158251	Miss Ledrook--	3852	’ groaned the collector . ‘
158269	158273	158274	158274	I	0	’ cried Nicholas . ‘
158285	158303	158284	158284	I	0	’m laughing at -- yes , that ’ll be very pretty -- the phenomenon -- who else ? ’
158304	158311	158313	158314	the collector	10290	‘ Some young woman or other , ’
158318	158343	158313	158314	the collector	10290	‘ some other friend of Henrietta Petowker ’s . Well , you ’ll be careful not to say anything about it , will you ? ’
158344	158352	158354	158354	Nicholas	207	‘ You may safely depend upon me , ’
158356	158367	158354	158354	Nicholas	207	‘ Wo n’t you take anything to eat or drink ? ’
158368	158371	158373	158374	the collector	10290	‘ No , ’
158376	158399	158373	158374	the collector	10290	‘ I have n’t any appetite . I should think it was a very pleasant life , the married one , eh ? ’
158400	158410	158412	158412	Nicholas	207	‘ I have not the least doubt of it , ’
158414	158417	158419	158420	the collector	10290	‘ Yes , ’
158422	158434	158419	158420	the collector	10290	‘ certainly . Oh yes . No doubt . Good night . ’
158586	158593	158595	158596	Miss Petowker	320	‘ I never will believe it , ’
158598	158626	158595	158596	Miss Petowker	320	‘ I can not really . It ’s of no use talking , I never can make up my mind to go through with such a trial ! ’
158832	158842	158844	158845	Miss Snevellicci	394	‘ I might feel it was a great blow , ’
158847	158877	158844	158845	Miss Snevellicci	394	‘ to break up old associations and what - do - you - callems of that kind , but I would submit , my dear , I would indeed . ’
158878	158883	158885	158886	Miss Ledrook	396	‘ So would I , ’
158888	158908	158844	158845	Miss Snevellicci	394	‘ I would rather court the yoke than shun it . I have broken hearts before now , and I ’m
158924	158925	158885	158886	Miss Ledrook	396	’ ‘
158930	158935	158885	158886	Miss Ledrook	396	’ said Miss Snevellicci . ‘
158960	159010	158956	158956	we	3866	’ This pious reasoning , and perhaps the fear of being too late , supported the bride through the ceremony of robing , after which , strong tea and brandy were administered in alternate doses as a means of strengthening her feeble limbs and causing her to walk steadier . ‘
159020	159025	159013	159013	you	702	’ inquired Miss Snevellicci . ‘
159029	159034	159013	159013	you	702	’ cried the bride . ‘
159045	159046	159039	159039	I	0	’ ‘
159061	159066	159049	159049	he	702	’ said Miss Ledrook . ‘
159074	159087	159068	159068	you	702	’ cried Miss Petowker , really showing great capability for the stage . ‘
159112	159191	159098	159098	you	702	’ There is no knowing in what this burst of feeling might have ended , if Miss Snevellicci had not at that moment proclaimed the arrival of the fly , which so astounded the bride that she shook off divers alarming symptoms which were coming on very strong , and running to the glass adjusted her dress , and calmly declared that she was ready for the sacrifice . She was accordingly supported into the coach , and there ‘
159194	159303	159304	159305	Henrietta Petowker	428	’ ( as Miss Snevellicci said ) with perpetual sniffs of SAL VOLATILE and sips of brandy and other gentle stimulants , until they reached the manager ’s door , which was already opened by the two Master Crummleses , who wore white cockades , and were decorated with the choicest and most resplendent waistcoats in the theatrical wardrobe . By the combined exertions of these young gentlemen and the bridesmaids , assisted by the coachman , Miss Petowker was at length supported in a condition of much exhaustion to the first floor , where she no sooner encountered the youthful bridegroom than she fainted with great decorum . ‘
159307	159312	159304	159305	Henrietta Petowker	428	’ said the collector ; ‘
159320	159335	159304	159305	Henrietta Petowker	428	’ Miss Petowker grasped the collector ’s hand , but emotion choked her utterance . ‘
159347	159352	159344	159345	Henrietta Petowker	428	’ said the collector . ‘
159360	159365	159344	159345	Henrietta Petowker	428	’ rejoined the bride ; ‘
159391	159735	159304	159305	Henrietta Petowker	428	’ With such expressions of sorrow , Miss Petowker went on to enumerate the dear friends of her youthful days one by one , and to call upon such of them as were present to come and embrace her . This done , she remembered that Mrs. Crummles had been more than a mother to her , and after that , that Mr. Crummles had been more than a father to her , and after that , that the Master Crummleses and Miss Ninetta Crummles had been more than brothers and sisters to her . These various remembrances being each accompanied with a series of hugs , occupied a long time , and they were obliged to drive to church very fast , for fear they should be too late . The procession consisted of two flys ; in the first of which were Miss Bravassa ( the fourth bridesmaid ) , Mrs. Crummles , the collector , and Mr Folair , who had been chosen as his second on the occasion . In the other were the bride , Mr. Crummles , Miss Snevellicci , Miss Ledrook , and the phenomenon . The costumes were beautiful . The bridesmaids were quite covered with artificial flowers , and the phenomenon , in particular , was rendered almost invisible by the portable arbour in which she was enshrined . Miss Ledrook , who was of a romantic turn , wore in her breast the miniature of some field - officer unknown , which she had purchased , a great bargain , not very long before ; the other ladies displayed several dazzling articles of imitative jewellery , almost equal to real , and Mrs Crummles came out in a stern and gloomy majesty , which attracted the admiration of all beholders . But , perhaps the appearance of Mr. Crummles was more striking and appropriate than that of any member of the party . This gentleman , who personated the bride ’s father , had , in pursuance of a happy and original conception , ‘
159738	159996	159304	159305	Henrietta Petowker	428	’ for the part by arraying himself in a theatrical wig , of a style and pattern commonly known as a brown George , and moreover assuming a snuff - coloured suit , of the previous century , with grey silk stockings , and buckles to his shoes . The better to support his assumed character he had determined to be greatly overcome , and , consequently , when they entered the church , the sobs of the affectionate parent were so heart - rending that the pew - opener suggested the propriety of his retiring to the vestry , and comforting himself with a glass of water before the ceremony began . The procession up the aisle was beautiful . The bride , with the four bridesmaids , forming a group previously arranged and rehearsed ; the collector , followed by his second , imitating his walk and gestures to the indescribable amusement of some theatrical friends in the gallery ; Mr. Crummles , with an infirm and feeble gait ; Mrs. Crummles advancing with that stage walk , which consists of a stride and a stop alternately -- it was the completest thing ever witnessed . The ceremony was very quickly disposed of , and all parties present having signed the register ( for which purpose , when it came to his turn , Mr. Crummles carefully wiped and put on an immense pair of spectacles ) , they went back to breakfast in high spirits . And here they found Nicholas awaiting their arrival . ‘
160000	160029	159304	159305	Henrietta Petowker	428	’ said Crummles , who had been assisting Mrs. Grudden in the preparations , which were on a more extensive scale than was quite agreeable to the collector . ‘
160034	160122	159304	159305	Henrietta Petowker	428	’ No second invitation was required . The company crowded and squeezed themselves at the table as well as they could , and fell to , immediately : Miss Petowker blushing very much when anybody was looking , and eating very much when anybody was NOT looking ; and Mr. Lillyvick going to work as though with the cool resolve , that since the good things must be paid for by him , he would leave as little as possible for the Crummleses to eat up afterwards . ‘
160135	160151	159304	159305	Henrietta Petowker	428	’ inquired Mr. Folair of the collector , leaning over the table to address him . ‘
160159	160164	160157	160157	sir	714	’ returned Mr. Lillyvick . ‘
160176	160181	160157	160157	sir	714	’ replied Mr. Folair . ‘
160191	160192	160157	160157	sir	714	’ ‘
160197	160204	160195	160195	sir	714	’ replied Mr. Lillyvick , colouring . ‘
160217	160218	160215	160215	sir	714	’ ‘
160223	160228	160215	160215	sir	714	’ said the actor . ‘
160248	160267	160270	160270	himself	625	’ Mr. Lillyvick laid down his knife and fork , and looked round the table with indignant astonishment . ‘
160272	160292	160270	160270	himself	625	’ repeated Mr. Lillyvick . A profound silence came upon all , for Mr. Lillyvick was dignified beyond expression . ‘
160297	160303	160270	160270	himself	625	’ cried Mr. Lillyvick again . ‘
160319	160320	160270	160270	himself	625	’ ‘
160327	160338	160342	160342	sir	714	’ said Mr. Folair , a little crest - fallen . ‘
160344	160349	160342	160342	sir	714	’ retorted Mr. Lillyvick . ‘
160365	160366	160367	160367	Lillyvick	316	’ ‘
160369	160374	160367	160367	Lillyvick	316	’ suggested Mr. Crummles . ‘
160383	160388	160376	160377	Henrietta Lillyvick	432	’ said the collector . ‘
160430	160431	160432	160432	Folair	390	’ ‘
160434	160456	160457	160457	I	0	’ said Mr. Crummles , deeming it a matter of decency to be affected by this allusion to himself and partner , ‘
160458	160463	160432	160432	Folair	390	’m astonished at you . ’
160464	160477	160479	160481	the unfortunate actor	3886	‘ What are you going on in this way at me for ? ’
160483	160489	160479	160481	the unfortunate actor	3886	‘ What have I done ? ’
160490	160495	160497	160498	Mr. Lillyvick	316	‘ Done , sir ! ’
160500	160510	160497	160498	Mr. Lillyvick	316	‘ aimed a blow at the whole framework of society-- ’
160511	160519	160521	160521	Crummles	381	‘ And the best and tenderest feelings , ’
160529	160540	160542	160543	the collector	10290	‘ And the highest and most estimable of social ties , ’
160545	160581	160542	160543	the collector	10290	‘ Noose ! As if one was caught , trapped into the married state , pinned by the leg , instead of going into it of one ’s own accord and glorying in the act ! ’
160582	160605	160607	160608	the actor	11435	‘ I did n’t mean to make it out , that you were caught and trapped , and pinned by the leg , ’
160610	160612	160607	160608	the actor	11435	‘ I ’m
160624	160625	160617	160617	I	0	’ ‘
160634	160639	160632	160632	sir	714	’ returned Mr. Lillyvick ; ‘
160657	161180	161181	161181	I	0	’ The quarrel appearing to terminate with this reply , Mrs. Lillyvick considered that the fittest occasion ( the attention of the company being no longer distracted ) to burst into tears , and require the assistance of all four bridesmaids , which was immediately rendered , though not without some confusion , for the room being small and the table - cloth long , a whole detachment of plates were swept off the board at the very first move . Regardless of this circumstance , however , Mrs. Lillyvick refused to be comforted until the belligerents had passed their words that the dispute should be carried no further , which , after a sufficient show of reluctance , they did , and from that time Mr. Folair sat in moody silence , contenting himself with pinching Nicholas ’s leg when anything was said , and so expressing his contempt both for the speaker and the sentiments to which he gave utterance . There were a great number of speeches made ; some by Nicholas , and some by Crummles , and some by the collector ; two by the Master Crummleses in returning thanks for themselves , and one by the phenomenon on behalf of the bridesmaids , at which Mrs. Crummles shed tears . There was some singing , too , from Miss Ledrook and Miss Bravassa , and very likely there might have been more , if the fly - driver , who stopped to drive the happy pair to the spot where they proposed to take steamboat to Ryde , had not sent in a peremptory message intimating , that if they did n’t come directly he should infallibly demand eighteen - pence over and above his agreement . This desperate threat effectually broke up the party . After a most pathetic leave - taking , Mr. Lillyvick and his bride departed for Ryde , where they were to spend the next two days in profound retirement , and whither they were accompanied by the infant , who had been appointed travelling bridesmaid on Mr. Lillyvick ’s express stipulation : as the steamboat people , deceived by her size , would ( he had previously ascertained ) transport her at half - price . As there was no performance that night , Mr. Crummles declared his intention of keeping it up till everything to drink was disposed of ; but Nicholas having to play Romeo for the first time on the ensuing evening , contrived to slip away in the midst of a temporary confusion , occasioned by the unexpected development of strong symptoms of inebriety in the conduct of Mrs. Grudden . To this act of desertion he was led , not only by his own inclinations , but by his anxiety on account of Smike , who , having to sustain the character of the Apothecary , had been as yet wholly unable to get any more of the part into his head than the general idea that he was very hungry , which -- perhaps from old recollections -- he had acquired with great aptitude . ‘
161193	161202	161191	161191	Smike	264	’ said Nicholas , laying down the book . ‘
161216	161217	161218	161218	I	0	’ ‘
161223	161231	161218	161218	I	0	’ said Smike , shaking his head . ‘
161246	161247	161232	161232	I	0	’ ‘
161250	161254	161257	161257	me	0	’ inquired Nicholas . ‘
161259	161260	161261	161261	I	0	’ ‘
161264	161268	161261	161261	I	0	’ said Smike , ‘
161298	161299	161296	161296	you	0	’ ‘
161305	161309	161301	161301	you	0	’ exclaimed Nicholas . ‘
161336	161337	161331	161334	Who calls so loud	3893	’ ‘
161345	161349	161331	161334	Who calls so loud	3893	’ said Smike . ‘
161357	161361	161331	161334	Who calls so loud	3893	’ repeated Nicholas . ‘
161369	162041	161331	161334	Who calls so loud	3893	’ cried Smike . Thus they continued to ask each other who called so loud , over and over again ; and when Smike had that by heart Nicholas went to another sentence , and then to two at a time , and then to three , and so on , until at midnight poor Smike found to his unspeakable joy that he really began to remember something about the text . Early in the morning they went to it again , and Smike , rendered more confident by the progress he had already made , got on faster and with better heart . As soon as he began to acquire the words pretty freely , Nicholas showed him how he must come in with both hands spread out upon his stomach , and how he must occasionally rub it , in compliance with the established form by which people on the stage always denote that they want something to eat . After the morning ’s rehearsal they went to work again , nor did they stop , except for a hasty dinner , until it was time to repair to the theatre at night . Never had master a more anxious , humble , docile pupil . Never had pupil a more patient , unwearying , considerate , kindhearted master . As soon as they were dressed , and at every interval when he was not upon the stage , Nicholas renewed his instructions . They prospered well . The Romeo was received with hearty plaudits and unbounded favour , and Smike was pronounced unanimously , alike by audience and actors , the very prince and prodigy of Apothecaries . CHAPTER 26 Is fraught with some Danger to Miss Nickleby ’s Peace of Mind The place was a handsome suite of private apartments in Regent Street ; the time was three o’clock in the afternoon to the dull and plodding , and the first hour of morning to the gay and spirited ; the persons were Lord Frederick Verisopht , and his friend Sir Mulberry Hawk . These distinguished gentlemen were reclining listlessly on a couple of sofas , with a table between them , on which were scattered in rich confusion the materials of an untasted breakfast . Newspapers lay strewn about the room , but these , like the meal , were neglected and unnoticed ; not , however , because any flow of conversation prevented the attractions of the journals from being called into request , for not a word was exchanged between the two , nor was any sound uttered , save when one , in tossing about to find an easier resting - place for his aching head , uttered an exclamation of impatience , and seemed for a moment to communicate a new restlessness to his companion . These appearances would in themselves have furnished a pretty strong clue to the extent of the debauch of the previous night , even if there had not been other indications of the amusements in which it had been passed . A couple of billiard balls , all mud and dirt , two battered hats , a champagne bottle with a soiled glove twisted round the neck , to allow of its being grasped more surely in its capacity of an offensive weapon ; a broken cane ; a card - case without the top ; an empty purse ; a watch - guard snapped asunder ; a handful of silver , mingled with fragments of half - smoked cigars , and their stale and crumbled ashes;--these , and many other tokens of riot and disorder , hinted very intelligibly at the nature of last night ’s gentlemanly frolics . Lord Frederick Verisopht was the first to speak . Dropping his slippered foot on the ground , and , yawning heavily , he struggled into a sitting posture , and turned his dull languid eyes towards his friend , to whom he called in a drowsy voice . ‘
162044	162052	161331	161334	Who calls so loud	3893	’ replied Sir Mulberry , turning round . ‘
162066	162071	162072	162072	I	0	’ said the lord . ‘
162078	162084	162086	162087	Sir Mulberry	358	’re fit for anything else , ’
162089	162108	162086	162087	Sir Mulberry	358	‘ yet awhile , at least . I have n’t a grain of life in me this morning . ’
162109	162112	162114	162115	Lord Verisopht	229	‘ Life ! ’
162117	162136	162114	162115	Lord Verisopht	229	‘ I feel as if there would be nothing so snug and comfortable as to die at once . ’
162137	162145	162147	162148	Sir Mulberry	358	‘ Then why do n’t you die ? ’
162232	162240	162242	162243	Sir Mulberry	358	‘ What the devil ’s the matter ? ’
162292	162296	162280	162280	himself	358	‘ infernal cold , ’
162323	162326	162328	162329	Sir Mulberry	358	‘ Suppose , ’
162342	162356	162328	162329	Sir Mulberry	358	‘ suppose we go back to the subject of little Nickleby , eh ? ’
162357	162374	162376	162377	Lord Verisopht	229	‘ Which little Nickleby ; the money - lender or the ga - a - l ? ’
162379	162387	162389	162390	Sir Mulberry	358	‘ You take me , I see , ’
162392	162399	162389	162390	Sir Mulberry	358	‘ The girl , of course . ’
162400	162410	162412	162413	Lord Verisopht	229	‘ You promised me you ’d find her out , ’
162415	162420	162422	162423	his friend	780	‘ So I did , ’
162425	162451	162422	162423	his friend	780	‘ but I have thought further of the matter since then . You distrust me in the business -- you shall find her out yourself . ’
162452	162457	162459	162460	Lord Verisopht	229	‘ Na - ay , ’
162462	162468	162459	162460	Lord Verisopht	229	‘ But I say yes , ’
162473	162534	162459	162460	Lord Verisopht	229	‘ You shall find her out yourself . Do n’t think that I mean , when you can -- I know as well as you that if I did , you could never get sight of her without me . No . I say you shall find her out -- SHALL -- and I ’ll put you in the way . ’
162535	162557	162559	162572	the young lord , on whom this speech had produced a most reviving effect	3902	‘ Now , curse me , if you ai n’t a real , deyvlish , downright , thorough - paced friend , ’
162574	162581	162583	162584	Sir Mulberry	358	‘ I ’ll tell you how , ’
162586	162598	162583	162584	Sir Mulberry	358	‘ She was at that dinner as a bait for you . ’
162599	162602	162604	162606	the young lord	3903	‘ No ! ’
162608	162612	162604	162606	the young lord	3903	‘ What the dey-- ’
162613	162620	162622	162623	his friend	780	‘ As a bait for you , ’
162625	162633	162622	162623	his friend	780	‘ old Nickleby told me so himself . ’
162634	162643	162645	162646	Lord Verisopht	229	‘ What a fine old cock it is ! ’
162648	162653	162645	162646	Lord Verisopht	229	‘ a noble rascal ! ’
162654	162657	162659	162660	Sir Mulberry	358	‘ Yes , ’
162662	162671	162659	162660	Sir Mulberry	358	‘ he knew she was a smart little creature-- ’
162672	162675	162677	162679	the young lord	3903	‘ Smart ! ’
162681	162712	162677	162679	the young lord	3903	‘ Upon my soul , Hawk , she ’s a perfect beauty -- a -- a picture , a statue , a -- a -- upon my soul she is ! ’
162713	162716	162718	162719	Sir Mulberry	358	‘ Well , ’
162736	162757	162722	162722	his	358	‘ that ’s a matter of taste ; if mine does n’t agree with yours , so much the better . ’
162758	162762	162764	162765	the lord	1669	‘ Confound it ! ’
162767	162787	162764	162765	the lord	1669	‘ you were thick enough with her that day , anyhow . I could hardly get in a word . ’
162788	162799	162801	162802	Sir Mulberry	358	‘ Well enough for once , well enough for once , ’
162804	162862	162801	162802	Sir Mulberry	358	‘ but not worth the trouble of being agreeable to again . If you seriously want to follow up the niece , tell the uncle that you must know where she lives and how she lives , and with whom , or you are no longer a customer of his . He ’ll tell you fast enough . ’
162863	162872	162874	162875	Lord Verisopht	229	‘ Why did n’t you say this before ? ’
162877	162899	162874	162875	Lord Verisopht	229	‘ instead of letting me go on burning , consuming , dragging out a miserable existence for an a - age ! ’
162900	162912	162914	162915	Sir Mulberry	358	‘ I did n’t know it , in the first place , ’
162918	162936	162914	162915	Sir Mulberry	358	‘ and in the second , I did n’t believe you were so very much in earnest . ’
163349	163354	163356	163357	Sir Mulberry	358	‘ Alone , eh ? ’
163362	163387	163356	163357	Sir Mulberry	358	‘ Oh , very good . I ’ll walk into the next room here . Do n’t keep me long , that ’s all . ’
163424	163430	163432	163432	Ralph	208	‘ Now , my lord , ’
163434	163439	163432	163432	Ralph	208	‘ what is it ? ’
163440	163443	163449	163449	himself	3922	‘ Nickleby , ’
163475	163484	163449	163449	himself	3922	‘ what a pretty creature your niece is ! ’
163485	163492	163494	163494	Ralph	208	‘ Is she , my lord ? ’
163496	163511	163494	163494	Ralph	208	‘ Maybe -- maybe -- I do n’t trouble my head with such matters . ’
163512	163522	163524	163525	the client	2519	‘ You know she ’s a deyvlish fine girl , ’
163527	163542	163524	163525	the client	2519	‘ You must know that , Nickleby . Come , do n’t deny that . ’
163543	163553	163555	163555	Ralph	208	‘ Yes , I believe she is considered so , ’
163557	163594	163555	163555	Ralph	208	‘ Indeed , I know she is . If I did not , you are an authority on such points , and your taste , my lord -- on all points , indeed -- is undeniable . ’
163647	163650	163651	163651	he	208	‘ Well , ’
163654	163657	163651	163651	he	208	‘ p’raps you ’re
163665	163697	163704	163704	his	208	’re a little wrong -- a little of both , Nickleby . I want to know where this beauty lives , that I may have another peep at her , Nickleby . ’
163698	163700	163701	163701	Ralph	208	‘ Really-- ’
163708	163715	163717	163718	the other	8439	‘ Do n’t talk so loud , ’
163731	163740	163717	163718	the other	8439	‘ I do n’t want Hawk to hear . ’
163741	163752	163754	163754	Ralph	208	‘ You know he is your rival , do you ? ’
163761	163773	163775	163776	the client	2519	‘ He always is , d - a - amn him , ’
163778	163831	163775	163776	the client	2519	‘ and I want to steal a march upon him . Ha , ha , ha ! He ’ll cut up so rough , Nickleby , at our talking together without him . Where does she live , Nickleby , that ’s all ? Only tell me where she lives , Nickleby . ’
163832	163836	163838	163838	Ralph	208	‘ He bites , ’
163840	163844	163838	163838	Ralph	208	‘ He bites . ’
163845	163852	163854	163855	the client	2519	‘ Eh , Nickleby , eh ? ’
163857	163863	163854	163855	the client	2519	‘ Where does she live ? ’
163864	163870	163872	163872	Ralph	208	‘ Really , my lord , ’
163882	163891	163872	163872	Ralph	208	‘ I must think before I tell you . ’
163892	163910	163912	163912	Verisopht	229	‘ No , not a bit of it , Nickleby ; you must n’t think at all , ’
163914	163919	163912	163912	Verisopht	229	‘ Where is it ? ’
163920	163929	163931	163931	Ralph	208	‘ No good can come of your knowing , ’
163933	163960	163961	163961	Ralph	208	‘ She has been virtuously and well brought up ; to be sure she is handsome , poor , unprotected ! Poor girl , poor girl . ’
164014	164025	164027	164028	his client	3922	‘ I tell you I only want to see her , ’
164030	164058	164027	164028	his client	3922	‘ A ma - an may look at a pretty woman without harm , may n’t he ? Now , where DOES she live ? You know you ’re
164088	164089	164082	164082	you	3922	’ ‘
164098	164106	164091	164091	you	3922	’ said Ralph , with feigned reluctance , ‘
164149	164228	164147	164147	yourself	3922	’ Ralph pointed to the adjoining room as he spoke , and nodded expressively . The young lord , feigning to be equally impressed with the necessity of this precaution , Ralph disclosed the present address and occupation of his niece , observing that from what he heard of the family they appeared very ambitious to have distinguished acquaintances , and that a lord could , doubtless , introduce himself with great ease , if he felt disposed . ‘
164238	164242	164243	164243	you	3922	’ said Ralph , ‘
164256	164299	164300	164300	I	0	’ Lord Verisopht acknowledged the hint with a great many squeezes of Ralph ’s hard , horny hand , and whispering that they would now do well to close the conversation , called to Sir Mulberry Hawk that he might come back . ‘
164308	164321	164300	164300	I	0	’ said Sir Mulberry , reappearing with an ill - tempered air . ‘
164327	164332	164300	164300	I	0	’ replied the gull ; ‘
164350	164351	164343	164343	I	0	’ ‘
164356	164360	164343	164343	I	0	’ said Ralph ; ‘
164397	164586	164587	164588	Mrs Nickleby	207	’ With such courtesies as these , and many low bows , and the same cold sneer upon his face all the while , Ralph busied himself in showing his visitors downstairs , and otherwise than by the slightest possible motion about the corners of his mouth , returned no show of answer to the look of admiration with which Sir Mulberry Hawk seemed to compliment him on being such an accomplished and most consummate scoundrel . There had been a ring at the bell a few minutes before , which was answered by Newman Noggs just as they reached the hall . In the ordinary course of business Newman would have either admitted the new - comer in silence , or have requested him or her to stand aside while the gentlemen passed out . But he no sooner saw who it was , than as if for some private reason of his own , he boldly departed from the established custom of Ralph ’s mansion in business hours , and looking towards the respectable trio who were approaching , cried in a loud and sonorous voice , ‘
164590	164591	164587	164588	Mrs Nickleby	207	’ ‘
164595	164655	164592	164593	Mrs. Nickleby	207	’ cried Sir Mulberry Hawk , as his friend looked back , and stared him in the face . It was , indeed , that well - intentioned lady , who , having received an offer for the empty house in the city directed to the landlord , had brought it post - haste to Mr. Nickleby without delay . ‘
164660	164664	164656	164656	Nobody	8541	’ said Ralph . ‘
164683	164684	164676	164676	I	0	’ ‘
164689	164701	164704	164705	Mrs. Nickleby	207	’ cried Sir Mulberry Hawk , advancing to the astonished lady . ‘
164737	164745	164704	164705	Mrs. Nickleby	207	’ said Sir Mulberry , stopping short . ‘
164780	164781	164772	164773	This lady	9409	’ ‘
164803	164816	164829	164829	my	0	’ said Mrs. Nickleby , acknowledging the compliment with a graceful bend , ‘
164824	164825	164826	164826	Her	9409	’ ‘
164832	164842	164826	164826	Her	9409	’ cried Sir Mulberry , turning to his friend . ‘
164851	164852	164826	164826	Her	9409	’ ‘
164856	164861	164826	164826	Her	9409	’ thought Mrs. Nickleby . ‘
164867	164868	164826	164826	Her	9409	’ ‘
164876	164881	164826	164826	Her	9409	’ said Sir Mulberry , ‘
164920	164931	164915	164915	Nickleby	226	’ Ralph did so , in a kind of desperation . ‘
164943	164951	164915	164915	Nickleby	226	’ said Lord Frederick , pressing forward . ‘
164956	165000	164915	164915	Nickleby	226	’ Mrs. Nickleby was too much flurried by these uncommonly kind salutations , and her regrets at not having on her other bonnet , to make any immediate reply , so she merely continued to bend and smile , and betray great agitation . ‘
165009	165014	165006	165007	Miss Nickleby	226	’ said Lord Frederick . ‘
165020	165021	165006	165007	Miss Nickleby	226	’ ‘
165028	165036	165027	165027	I	0	’m obliged to you , my lord , ’
165043	165163	165165	165166	Mrs Nickleby	207	‘ Quite well . She was n’t well for some days after that day she dined here , and I ca n’t help thinking , that she caught cold in that hackney coach coming home . Hackney coaches , my lord , are such nasty things , that it ’s almost better to walk at any time , for although I believe a hackney coachman can be transported for life , if he has a broken window , still they are so reckless , that they nearly all have broken windows . I once had a swelled face for six weeks , my lord , from riding in a hackney coach -- I think it was a hackney coach , ’
165169	165172	165165	165166	Mrs Nickleby	207	‘ though I ’m
165370	165400	165355	165355	I	0	’ Having pretty well run herself out by this time , Mrs. Nickleby stopped as suddenly as she had started off ; and repeated that Kate was quite well . ‘
165403	165408	165355	165355	I	0	’ said Mrs. Nickleby , ‘
165445	165446	165419	165419	she	3971	’ ‘
165453	165469	165419	165419	she	3971	’ growled Ralph , pointing to the little packet Mrs. Nickleby held in her hand . ‘
165479	165484	165419	165419	she	3971	’ replied Mrs. Nickleby , ‘
165500	165501	165486	165486	I	0	’ ‘

165772	165777	165764	165764	you	0	’ replied Ralph impatiently , ‘

165802	165807	165790	165790	you	0	’ returned Mrs. Nickleby . ‘

165827	165844	165810	165810	I	0	’ said Ralph , who seldom offered refreshments unless something was to be got by it . ‘
165850	165860	165810	165810	I	0	’ returned Mrs. Nickleby , glancing at the dial . ‘
165864	165869	165861	165862	Lord Frederick	229	’ said Sir Mulberry , ‘
165887	165888	165878	165878	We	3982	’ ‘
165897	165898	165893	165893	Ye	0	’ ‘
165909	166090	165901	165901	I	0	’ said Mrs. Nickleby . But Sir Mulberry Hawk and Lord Verisopht were peremptory in their politeness , and leaving Ralph , who seemed to think , not unwisely , that he looked less ridiculous as a mere spectator , than he would have done if he had taken any part in these proceedings , they quitted the house with Mrs. Nickleby between them ; that good lady in a perfect ecstasy of satisfaction , no less with the attentions shown her by two titled gentlemen , than with the conviction that Kate might now pick and choose , at least between two large fortunes , and most unexceptionable husbands . As she was carried away for the moment by an irresistible train of thought , all connected with her daughter ’s future greatness , Sir Mulberry Hawk and his friend exchanged glances over the top of the bonnet which the poor lady so much regretted not having left at home , and proceeded to dilate with great rapture , but much respect on the manifold perfections of Miss Nickleby . ‘
166111	166127	166103	166105	this amiable creature	3984	’ said Sir Mulberry , throwing into his voice an indication of the warmest feeling . ‘
166134	166139	166140	166140	she	3984	’ replied Mrs. Nickleby ; ‘
166156	166157	166158	166158	She	3984	’ ‘
166162	166176	166158	166158	She	3984	’ said Lord Verisopht , with the air of a judge of cleverness . ‘
166186	166191	166180	166180	she	3984	’ returned Mrs. Nickleby . ‘
166265	166270	166263	166263	me	0	’ said Mrs Nickleby , ‘
166347	166352	166339	166340	The girls	4000	’ added Mrs. Nickleby , ‘
166426	166482	166563	166563	them	4000	’ With similar recollections Mrs. Nickleby beguiled the tediousness of the way , until they reached the omnibus , which the extreme politeness of her new friends would not allow them to leave until it actually started , when they took their hats , as Mrs. Nickleby solemnly assured her hearers on many subsequent occasions , ‘
166486	166544	166563	166563	them	4000	’ and kissed their straw - coloured kid gloves till they were no longer visible . Mrs. Nickleby leant back in the furthest corner of the conveyance , and , closing her eyes , resigned herself to a host of most pleasing meditations . Kate had never said a word about having met either of these gentlemen ; ‘
166547	166551	166554	166554	she	4002	’ she thought , ‘
166565	166606	166554	166554	she	4002	’ Then the question arose , which one could it be . The lord was the youngest , and his title was certainly the grandest ; still Kate was not the girl to be swayed by such considerations as these . ‘
166617	166624	166607	166607	I	0	’ said Mrs. Nickleby to herself ; ‘
166684	166922	166681	166682	Sir Mulberry	358	’ And then her thoughts flew back to her old predictions , and the number of times she had said , that Kate with no fortune would marry better than other people ’s daughters with thousands ; and , as she pictured with the brightness of a mother ’s fancy all the beauty and grace of the poor girl who had struggled so cheerfully with her new life of hardship and trial , her heart grew too full , and the tears trickled down her face . Meanwhile , Ralph walked to and fro in his little back - office , troubled in mind by what had just occurred . To say that Ralph loved or cared for -- in the most ordinary acceptation of those terms -- any one of God ’s creatures , would be the wildest fiction . Still , there had somehow stolen upon him from time to time a thought of his niece which was tinged with compassion and pity ; breaking through the dull cloud of dislike or indifference which darkened men and women in his eyes , there was , in her case , the faintest gleam of light -- a most feeble and sickly ray at the best of times -- but there it was , and it showed the poor girl in a better and purer aspect than any in which he had looked on human nature yet . ‘
166926	166930	166923	166923	I	0	’ thought Ralph , ‘
166997	167015	166984	166984	Pshaw	435	’ He sat down , and told the chances , for and against , on his fingers . ‘
167028	167032	167044	167044	her	4011	’ thought Ralph , ‘
167079	167092	167093	167093	She	3787	’ said Ralph , aloud , as he locked his iron safe . ‘
167105	167225	167102	167102	her	3787	’ CHAPTER 27 Mrs. Nickleby becomes acquainted with Messrs Pyke and Pluck , whose Affection and Interest are beyond all Bounds Mrs. Nickleby had not felt so proud and important for many a day , as when , on reaching home , she gave herself wholly up to the pleasant visions which had accompanied her on her way thither . Lady Mulberry Hawk -- that was the prevalent idea . Lady Mulberry Hawk!--On Tuesday last , at St George ’s , Hanover Square , by the Right Reverend the Bishop of Llandaff , Sir Mulberry Hawk , of Mulberry Castle , North Wales , to Catherine , only daughter of the late Nicholas Nickleby , Esquire , of Devonshire . ‘
167230	167236	167102	167102	her	3787	’ cried Mrs. Nicholas Nickleby , ‘
167242	167315	167102	167102	her	3787	’ Having dispatched the ceremony , with its attendant festivities , to the perfect satisfaction of her own mind , the sanguine mother pictured to her imagination a long train of honours and distinctions which could not fail to accompany Kate in her new and brilliant sphere . She would be presented at court , of course . On the anniversary of her birthday , which was upon the nineteenth of July [ ‘
167326	167334	167102	167102	her	3787	’ thought Mrs. Nickleby in a parenthesis , ‘
167343	167436	167102	167102	her	3787	’ ) , Sir Mulberry would give a great feast to all his tenants , and would return them three and a half per cent on the amount of their last half - year ’s rent , as would be fully described and recorded in the fashionable intelligence , to the immeasurable delight and admiration of all the readers thereof . Kate ’s picture , too , would be in at least half - a - dozen of the annuals , and on the opposite page would appear , in delicate type , ‘
167452	167655	167448	167450	Sir Dingleby Dabber	439	’ Perhaps some one annual , of more comprehensive design than its fellows , might even contain a portrait of the mother of Lady Mulberry Hawk , with lines by the father of Sir Dingleby Dabber . More unlikely things had come to pass . Less interesting portraits had appeared . As this thought occurred to the good lady , her countenance unconsciously assumed that compound expression of simpering and sleepiness which , being common to all such portraits , is perhaps one reason why they are always so charming and agreeable . With such triumphs of aerial architecture did Mrs. Nickleby occupy the whole evening after her accidental introduction to Ralph ’s titled friends ; and dreams , no less prophetic and equally promising , haunted her sleep that night . She was preparing for her frugal dinner next day , still occupied with the same ideas -- a little softened down perhaps by sleep and daylight -- when the girl who attended her , partly for company , and partly to assist in the household affairs , rushed into the room in unwonted agitation , and announced that two gentlemen were waiting in the passage for permission to walk upstairs . ‘
167660	167672	167448	167450	Sir Dingleby Dabber	439	’ cried Mrs. Nickleby , hastily arranging her cap and front , ‘
167705	167758	167692	167692	you	4014	’ While the girl was gone on this errand , Mrs. Nickleby hastily swept into a cupboard all vestiges of eating and drinking ; which she had scarcely done , and seated herself with looks as collected as she could assume , when two gentlemen , both perfect strangers , presented themselves . ‘
167764	167780	167761	167761	you	0	’ said one gentleman , laying great stress on the last word of the inquiry . ‘
167786	167837	167871	167871	Pluck	362	’ said the other gentleman , altering the emphasis , as if to give variety to the salutation . Mrs. Nickleby curtseyed and smiled , and curtseyed again , and remarked , rubbing her hands as she did so , that she had n’t the -- really -- the honour to-- ‘
167842	167848	167871	167871	Pluck	362	’ said the first gentleman . ‘

167873	167879	167871	167871	Pluck	362	’ answered the other gentleman . ‘
167892	167898	167890	167890	Pyke	362	’ said the first gentleman . ‘
167904	167909	167902	167902	Pluck	362	’ answered the second . ‘
167913	167919	167902	167902	Pluck	362	’ said the first gentleman , ‘

167957	167963	167955	167955	Pluck	362	’ said Pyke , reproachfully . ‘
167970	167978	167966	167966	him	4017	’ said Mr. Pluck , looking round ; ‘
168008	168022	168005	168006	Mrs. Nickleby	207	’ Mr. Pyke laid his hand upon his heart , and bowed low . ‘
168033	168134	168152	168153	Mrs. Nickleby	207	’ said Mr Pluck--‘whether I shall say myself that my name is Pluck , or whether I shall ask my friend Pyke ( who being now regularly introduced , is competent to the office ) to state for me , Mrs. Nickleby , that my name is Pluck ; whether I shall claim your acquaintance on the plain ground of the strong interest I take in your welfare , or whether I shall make myself known to you as the friend of Sir Mulberry Hawk -- these , Mrs Nickleby , are considerations which I leave to you to determine . ’
168135	168150	168152	168153	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ Any friend of Sir Mulberry Hawk ’s requires no better introduction to me , ’
168157	168167	168169	168170	Mr. Pluck	360	‘ It is delightful to hear you say so , ’
168185	168243	168182	168182	himself	360	‘ It is refreshing to know that you hold my excellent friend , Sir Mulberry , in such high esteem . A word in your ear , Mrs. Nickleby . When Sir Mulberry knows it , he will be a happy man -- I say , Mrs. Nickleby , a happy man . Pyke , be seated . ’
168244	168249	168251	168252	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ MY good opinion , ’
168282	168283	168279	168280	Sir Mulberry	358	’ ‘
168288	168293	168294	168294	Pyke	359	’ exclaimed Mr. Pluck . ‘
168314	168315	168311	168312	Mrs. Nickleby	207	’ ‘
168320	168324	168311	168312	Mrs. Nickleby	207	’ echoed Pyke . ‘
168327	168331	168311	168312	Mrs. Nickleby	207	’ repeated Pluck ; ‘
168339	168340	168311	168312	Mrs. Nickleby	207	’ ‘
168347	168351	168311	168312	Mrs. Nickleby	207	’ replied Pyke . ‘
168359	168364	168352	168353	Mrs. Nickleby	207	’ said Mr. Pluck , ‘

168378	168383	168376	168376	Pluck	360	’ said his friend , ‘

168392	168402	168388	168388	Pyke	359	’ muttered Mr. Pluck , after a short pause ; ‘

168427	168434	168418	168418	Pyke	359	’ thought Mrs. Nickleby within herself . ‘
168444	168512	168440	168440	I	0	’ Mr. Pluck , after feigning to be in a condition of great embarrassment for some minutes , resumed the conversation by entreating Mrs. Nickleby to take no heed of what he had inadvertently said -- to consider him imprudent , rash , injudicious . The only stipulation he would make in his own favour was , that she should give him credit for the best intentions . ‘
168516	168521	168523	168523	I	0	’ said Mr. Pluck , ‘

168938	168943	168918	168918	Pluck	360	’ replied Mr. Pluck . ‘
168947	168957	168977	168978	Mrs. Nickleby	207	’ said Pyke , as if suddenly recollecting himself ; ‘
168980	168981	168977	168978	Mrs. Nickleby	207	’ ‘
168986	169010	168977	168978	Mrs. Nickleby	207	’ exclaimed that good lady , to whose mind a definite proposal of marriage for Kate at once presented itself in lively colours . ‘
169015	169019	169012	169013	Sir Mulberry	358	’ replied Pyke . ‘
169027	169028	169020	169020	You	207	’ ‘

169152	169159	169147	169147	You	207	’ said Mrs. Nickleby , hesitating ; ‘

169177	169182	169174	169175	Mrs. Nickleby	207	’ remonstrated Mr Pluck ; ‘
169253	169254	169250	169251	Mrs. Nickleby	207	’ ‘
169269	169275	169262	169262	I	0	’ replied the worthy lady . ‘
169291	169296	169297	169298	Mrs. Nickleby	207	’ urged Mr. Pluck . ‘
169300	169310	169297	169298	Mrs. Nickleby	207	’ said that excellent gentleman , lowering his voice , ‘
169363	169393	169351	169352	Mrs. Nickleby	207	’ Mrs. Nickleby cast an apprehensive glance at the warlike Pyke , who had walked to the window ; and Mr. Pluck , squeezing her hand , went on : ‘
169426	169427	169424	169424	Hem	233	’ ‘
169430	169450	169424	169424	Hem	233	’ cried Mr. Pyke at this juncture , snatching something from the chimney - piece with a theatrical air . ‘

169471	169476	169464	169464	you	207	’ asked Mr. Pluck . ‘
169488	169504	169464	169464	you	207	’ cried Mr. Pyke , falling into his chair with a miniature in his hand ; ‘
169522	169523	169524	169524	I	0	’ ‘
169531	169541	169524	169524	I	0	’ exclaimed Mr. Pluck in a fit of enthusiasm . ‘
169554	169555	169524	169524	I	0	’ ‘
169563	169889	169558	169559	my daughter	11202	’ said Mrs. Nickleby , with great pride . And so it was . And little Miss La Creevy had brought it home for inspection only two nights before . Mr. Pyke no sooner ascertained that he was quite right in his conjecture , than he launched into the most extravagant encomiums of the divine original ; and in the warmth of his enthusiasm kissed the picture a thousand times , while Mr. Pluck pressed Mrs. Nickleby ’s hand to his heart , and congratulated her on the possession of such a daughter , with so much earnestness and affection , that the tears stood , or seemed to stand , in his eyes . Poor Mrs. Nickleby , who had listened in a state of enviable complacency at first , became at length quite overpowered by these tokens of regard for , and attachment to , the family ; and even the servant girl , who had peeped in at the door , remained rooted to the spot in astonishment at the ecstasies of the two friendly visitors . By degrees these raptures subsided , and Mrs. Nickleby went on to entertain her guests with a lament over her fallen fortunes , and a picturesque account of her old house in the country : comprising a full description of the different apartments , not forgetting the little store - room , and a lively recollection of how many steps you went down to get into the garden , and which way you turned when you came out at the parlour door , and what capital fixtures there were in the kitchen . This last reflection naturally conducted her into the wash - house , where she stumbled upon the brewing utensils , among which she might have wandered for an hour , if the mere mention of those implements had not , by an association of ideas , instantly reminded Mr. Pyke that he was ‘
169893	169894	169558	169559	my daughter	11202	’ ‘
169902	169907	169896	169896	I	0	’ said Mr. Pyke ; ‘
169937	170061	169932	169932	I	0	’ And positively and actually Mr. Pyke DID drink it , and Mr. Pluck helped him , while Mrs. Nickleby looked on in divided admiration of the condescension of the two , and the aptitude with which they accommodated themselves to the pewter - pot ; in explanation of which seeming marvel it may be here observed , that gentlemen who , like Messrs Pyke and Pluck , live upon their wits ( or not so much , perhaps , upon the presence of their own wits as upon the absence of wits in other people ) are occasionally reduced to very narrow shifts and straits , and are at such periods accustomed to regale themselves in a very simple and primitive manner . ‘
170070	170077	169932	169932	I	0	’ said Mr. Pyke , rising , ‘
170107	170134	170135	170136	Mr. Pluck	360	’ This , by the way , was a very remarkable circumstance , miniatures being liable to so many changes of expression--‘Oh , Pluck ! Pluck ! ’
170301	170318	170320	170321	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ I am quite in love with that dear Mr Pluck , I declare I am , ’
170374	170381	170356	170356	she	207	‘ But I do n’t know , ’
170386	170416	170356	170356	she	207	‘ she is a very worthy person , but I am afraid too much beneath Sir Mulberry ’s station for us to make a companion of . Poor thing ! ’

170950	170974	170946	170948	Sir Mulberry Hawk	358	‘ It ’s you that ’s kind , upon my soul it is . It was so kind of you to come tonight . ’
170975	170991	170993	170994	Mrs Nickleby	207	‘ So very kind of you to invite me , you mean , Sir Mulberry , ’
171005	171038	171040	171041	Sir Mulberry	358	‘ I am so anxious to know you , so anxious to cultivate your good opinion , so desirous that there should be a delicious kind of harmonious family understanding between us , ’

171072	171085	171087	171088	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ I am sure you ca n’t be selfish , Sir Mulberry ! ’
171090	171103	171087	171088	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ You have much too open and generous a countenance for that . ’
171104	171112	171114	171116	Sir Mulberry Hawk	358	‘ What an extraordinary observer you are ! ’
171118	171136	171138	171139	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ Oh no , indeed , I do n’t see very far into things , Sir Mulberry , ’

171241	171255	171257	171258	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ But where ’s my brother - in - law , Sir Mulberry ? ’
171260	171275	171257	171258	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ I should n’t be here without him . I hope he ’s coming . ’

171415	171419	171421	171422	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ Why not ? ’
171424	171430	171421	171422	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ What is the matter ? ’
171431	171434	171436	171437	Sir Mulberry	358	‘ Hush ! ’
171446	171459	171440	171440	his	358	‘ Lord Frederick , do you recognise the tones of that voice ? ’
171460	171477	171421	171422	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ Deyvle take me if I did n’t think it was the voice of Miss Nickleby . ’
171478	171484	171492	171492	her	4079	‘ Lor , my lord ! ’

171510	171520	171421	171422	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ YOU here , mama ! Is it possible ! ’
171521	171529	171492	171492	her	4079	‘ Possible , my dear ? Yes . ’
171530	171546	171548	171548	Kate	210	‘ Why who -- who on earth is that you have with you , mama ? ’
171565	171574	171576	171577	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ Who do you suppose , my dear ? ’
171595	171613	171581	171582	Mrs Wititterly	374	‘ There ’s Mr. Pyke , Mr. Pluck , Sir Mulberry Hawk , and Lord Frederick Verisopht . ’
171614	171618	171620	171620	Kate	210	‘ Gracious Heaven ! ’
171623	171631	171620	171620	Kate	210	‘ How comes she in such society ? ’
171846	171851	171853	171854	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ My dear Kate , ’
171861	171878	171853	171854	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ How ill you looked a moment ago ! You quite frightened me , I declare ! ’
171879	171895	171897	171897	Kate	210	‘ It was mere fancy , mama,--the -- the -- reflection of the lights perhaps , ’
171914	171926	171897	171897	Kate	210	‘ Do n’t you see Sir Mulberry Hawk , my dear ? ’
172079	172085	172087	172088	Mr. Wititterly	375	‘ Mrs. Wititterly is delighted , ’
172094	172199	172087	172088	Mr. Wititterly	375	‘ delighted , my lord , I am sure , with this opportunity of contracting an acquaintance which , I trust , my lord , we shall improve . Julia , my dear , you must not allow yourself to be too much excited , you must not . Indeed you must not . Mrs. Wititterly is of a most excitable nature , Sir Mulberry . The snuff of a candle , the wick of a lamp , the bloom on a peach , the down on a butterfly . You might blow her away , my lord ; you might blow her away . ’
172259	172268	172270	172271	Mrs. Wititterly	374	‘ I take an interest , my lord , ’
172278	172286	172270	172271	Mrs. Wititterly	374	‘ such an interest in the drama . ’
172287	172297	172299	172300	Lord Verisopht	229	‘ Ye -- es . It ’s very interesting , ’
172302	172304	172299	172300	Lord Verisopht	229	‘ I ’m
172310	172315	172316	172316	I	0	’ said Mrs. Wititterly . ‘

172351	172356	172347	172347	Ye	374	’ replied Lord Verisopht . ‘
172363	172364	172359	172361	a clayver man	4095	’ ‘
172372	172382	172366	172366	you	1500	’ said Mrs. Wititterly , after a long silence , ‘
172417	172418	172410	172410	you	1500	’ ‘
172423	172427	172410	172410	you	1500	’ replied Verisopht . ‘
172438	172450	172430	172430	you	1500	’ returned Mrs. Wititterly , in very languid and drawling accents . ‘
172493	172494	172495	172495	Ye	1500	’ ‘
172499	172504	172495	172495	Ye	1500	’ replied Lord Verisopht , ‘
172511	172512	172513	172513	Julia	379	’ ‘
172518	172523	172513	172513	Julia	379	’ interposed Mr. Wititterly , ‘
172582	172583	172584	172584	I	0	’ ‘
172594	172606	172584	172584	I	0	’ said Mrs. Nickleby , who had been listening in silence ; ‘
172642	172649	172584	172584	I	0	’ said Mrs. Nickleby , considering ; ‘
172795	172802	172770	172770	he	208	’ continued Mrs. Nickleby , considering . ‘
172855	172867	172853	172853	ma’am	8678	’ added Mrs. Nickleby , in a whisper to Mrs. Wititterly , ‘
172890	173237	172853	172853	ma’am	8678	’ When Mrs. Nickleby had brought this interesting anecdote to a close , Pyke and Pluck , ever zealous in their patron ’s cause , proposed the adjournment of a detachment of the party into the next box ; and with so much skill were the preliminaries adjusted , that Kate , despite all she could say or do to the contrary , had no alternative but to suffer herself to be led away by Sir Mulberry Hawk . Her mother and Mr. Pluck accompanied them , but the worthy lady , pluming herself upon her discretion , took particular care not so much as to look at her daughter during the whole evening , and to seem wholly absorbed in the jokes and conversation of Mr. Pluck , who , having been appointed sentry over Mrs Nickleby for that especial purpose , neglected , on his side , no possible opportunity of engrossing her attention . Lord Frederick Verisopht remained in the next box to be talked to by Mrs Wititterly , and Mr. Pyke was in attendance to throw in a word or two when necessary . As to Mr. Wititterly , he was sufficiently busy in the body of the house , informing such of his friends and acquaintance as happened to be there , that those two gentlemen upstairs , whom they had seen in conversation with Mrs. W. , were the distinguished Lord Frederick Verisopht and his most intimate friend , the gay Sir Mulberry Hawk -- a communication which inflamed several respectable house - keepers with the utmost jealousy and rage , and reduced sixteen unmarried daughters to the very brink of despair . The evening came to an end at last , but Kate had yet to be handed downstairs by the detested Sir Mulberry ; and so skilfully were the manoeuvres of Messrs Pyke and Pluck conducted , that she and the baronet were the last of the party , and were even -- without an appearance of effort or design -- left at some little distance behind . ‘
173246	173273	172853	172853	ma’am	8678	’ said Sir Mulberry , as Kate hastened on , and attempted to release her arm . She made no reply , but still pressed forward . ‘
173277	173287	173288	173288	You	4123	’ coolly observed Sir Mulberry , stopping her outright . ‘
173299	173305	173297	173297	sir	714	’ said Kate , angrily . ‘
173310	173315	173316	173316	My	0	’ retorted Sir Mulberry . ‘
173331	173332	173323	173323	you	0	’ ‘
173335	173341	173316	173316	My	0	’ repeated Kate , indignantly . ‘
173363	173364	173344	173344	you	714	’ ‘
173375	173391	173365	173365	You	0	’ said Sir Mulberry Hawk , stooping down , the better to see her face . ‘
173404	173408	173392	173392	I	0	’ said Kate . ‘
173468	173489	173459	173459	you	714	’ Sir Mulberry smiled , and still looking in her face and retaining her arm , walked towards the door . ‘
173511	173540	173565	173565	he	358	’ said Kate , scarcely knowing , in the tumult of her passions , what she said,--‘I have a brother who will resent it dearly , one day . ’
173541	173546	173556	173556	himself	358	‘ Upon my soul ! ’
173568	173598	173559	173559	his	358	‘ she looks more beautiful , and I like her better in this mood , than when her eyes are cast down , and she is in perfect repose ! ’
173773	173776	173778	173779	Sir Mulberry	358	‘ There , ’
173787	173845	173778	173779	Sir Mulberry	358	‘ Did n’t I tell you last night that if we could find where they were going by bribing a servant through my fellow , and then established ourselves close by with the mother , these people ’s honour would be our own ? Why here it is , done in four - and - twenty hours . ’
173846	173851	173853	173854	the dupe	4143	‘ Ye -- es , ’
173856	173871	173853	173854	the dupe	4143	‘ But I have been tied to the old woman all ni - ight . ’
173872	173876	173878	173879	Sir Mulberry	358	‘ Hear him , ’
173887	173920	173878	173879	Sir Mulberry	358	‘ Hear this discontented grumbler . Is n’t it enough to make a man swear never to help him in his plots and schemes again ? Is n’t it an infernal shame ? ’
173941	173948	173950	173950	Verisopht	229	‘ Is n’t it the truth ? ’
173952	173958	173950	173950	Verisopht	229	‘ Was n’t it so ? ’
173959	173965	173967	173968	Sir Mulberry	358	‘ Was n’t it so ! ’
173970	174074	173967	173968	Sir Mulberry	358	‘ How would you have had it ? How could we have got a general invitation at first sight -- come when you like , go when you like , stop as long as you like , do what you like -- if you , the lord , had not made yourself agreeable to the foolish mistress of the house ? Do I care for this girl , except as your friend ? Have n’t I been sounding your praises in her ears , and bearing her pretty sulks and peevishness all night for you ? What sort of stuff do you think I ’m
174095	174096	174097	174097	You	0	’ ‘
174098	174104	174106	174109	the poor young lord	4147	’re a deyvlish good fellow , ’
174117	174122	174106	174109	the poor young lord	4147	‘ Upon my life you ’re

174141	174146	174139	174139	I	0	’ demanded Sir Mulberry . ‘
174152	174153	174139	174139	I	0	’ ‘
174173	174174	174175	174175	Ye	4150	’ ‘
174187	174192	174184	174185	a friend	627	’ replied the other . ‘
174196	174201	174202	174202	I	0	’ replied Sir Mulberry , ‘
174203	174232	174184	174185	a friend	627	’m satisfied . And now let ’s go and have our revenge on the German baron and the Frenchman , who cleaned you out so handsomely last night . ’
174875	174880	174882	174883	Mrs Nickleby	207	‘ And I never , ’
174885	174911	174882	174883	Mrs Nickleby	207	‘ was more delighted in my life than to observe last night , my dear , that your good sense had already told you this . ’
175203	175208	175192	175192	Kate	210	‘ The Lady Flabella , ’
175276	175356	175272	175272	Kate	210	‘ “ Cherizette , ” said the Lady Flabella , inserting her mouse - like feet in the blue satin slippers , which had unwittingly occasioned the half - playful half - angry altercation between herself and the youthful Colonel Befillaire , in the Duke of Mincefenille ’s SALON DE DANSE on the previous night . “ CHERIZETTE , MA CHERE , DONNEZ - MOI DE L’EAU - DE - COLOGNE , S’IL VOUS PLAIT , MON ENFANT . ” ‘
175423	175556	175557	175559	The Lady Flabella	444	‘ At this instant , while the Lady Flabella yet inhaled that delicious fragrance by holding the MOUCHOIR to her exquisite , but thoughtfully - chiselled nose , the door of the BOUDOIR ( artfully concealed by rich hangings of silken damask , the hue of Italy ’s firmament ) was thrown open , and with noiseless tread two VALETS - DE - CHAMBRE , clad in sumptuous liveries of peach - blossom and gold , advanced into the room followed by a page in BAS DE SOIE -- silk stockings -- who , while they remained at some distance making the most graceful obeisances , advanced to the feet of his lovely mistress , and dropping on one knee presented , on a golden salver gorgeously chased , a scented BILLET . ‘
175600	175601	175596	175598	HER OWN Befillaire	4190	’ ‘
175606	175618	175596	175598	HER OWN Befillaire	4190	’ interrupted Kate ’s patroness , who was sometimes taken literary . ‘
175631	175635	175628	175629	Miss Nickleby	226	’ Kate complied . ‘
175640	175649	175628	175629	Miss Nickleby	226	’ said Mrs. Wititterly , with a sigh . ‘
175660	175661	175664	175664	I	0	’ ‘
175669	175675	175664	175664	I	0	’ replied Kate , gently ; ‘
175679	175680	175685	175686	Miss Nickleby	226	’ ‘
175688	175693	175685	175686	Miss Nickleby	226	’ said Mrs. Wititterly . ‘
175718	175749	175664	175664	I	0	’ Kate complied , not unwillingly ; and , as she did so , Mrs. Wititterly raising her glass with a languid hand , remarked , that she looked pale . ‘
175764	175768	175685	175686	Miss Nickleby	226	’ said Kate . ‘
175773	175829	175685	175686	Miss Nickleby	226	’ exclaimed Mrs. Wititterly , with a look of surprise . And certainly , when one comes to think of it , it WAS very odd that anything should have disturbed a companion . A steam - engine , or other ingenious piece of mechanism out of order , would have been nothing to it . ‘
175847	175859	175860	175860	I	0	’ asked Mrs. Wititterly , still eyeing Kate through her glass . ‘
175868	175900	175860	175860	I	0	’ said Kate , vexed to feel that she was colouring deeply , but unable to keep down the blood which rushed to her face whenever she thought of that man . ‘
175907	175908	175902	175902	you	0	’ ‘
175911	175915	175902	175902	you	0	’ rejoined Kate . ‘

175944	175954	175929	175931	that respectable person	4194	’ said Mrs. Wititterly , in a lofty manner . ‘
175974	176043	176044	176044	They	4191	’ This was said lest Miss Nickleby should grow conceited on the honour and dignity of having known four great people ( for Pyke and Pluck were included among the delightful creatures ) , whom Mrs. Wititterly did not know . But as the circumstance had made no impression one way or other upon Kate ’s mind , the force of the observation was quite lost upon her . ‘
176050	176055	176044	176044	They	4191	’ said Mrs. Wititterly . ‘
176063	176064	176056	176056	I	0	’ ‘
176071	176124	176066	176066	you	0	’ Kate ventured to inquire . Mrs. Wititterly ’s answer was lost in the noise of a tremendous rapping at the street - door , and before it had ceased to vibrate , there drove up a handsome cabriolet , out of which leaped Sir Mulberry Hawk and his friend Lord Verisopht . ‘
176130	176139	176140	176141	Miss Nickleby	226	’ said Kate , rising and hurrying away . ‘
176143	176168	176140	176141	Miss Nickleby	226	’ cried Mrs. Wititterly , perfectly aghast at a companion ’s attempting to quit the room , without her permission first had and obtained . ‘
176176	176177	176178	176178	You	0	’ ‘
176183	176187	176178	176178	You	0	’ replied Kate . ‘

176193	176207	176209	176210	Mrs. Wititterly	374	’ sake , do n’t agitate me by making me speak so much , ’
176216	176225	176209	176210	Mrs. Wititterly	374	‘ Dear me , Miss Nickleby , I beg-- ’
176299	176308	176310	176311	Mr. Pluck	360	‘ The most extraordinary thing in the world , ’
176321	176347	176310	176311	Mr. Pluck	360	‘ the most extraordinary thing . As Lord Frederick and Sir Mulberry drove up to the door , Pyke and I had that instant knocked . ’
176348	176353	176355	176355	Pyke	359	‘ That instant knocked , ’
176357	176370	176372	176373	Mrs. Wititterly	374	‘ No matter how you came , so that you are here , ’
176421	176430	176406	176406	herself	374	‘ I am delighted , I am sure . ’
176431	176438	176440	176442	Sir Mulberry Hawk	358	‘ And how is Miss Nickleby ? ’
176468	176482	176484	176485	the lady	8485	‘ Why , she complains of suffering from the fright of last night , ’
176487	176507	176484	176485	the lady	8485	‘ I am sure I do n’t wonder at it , for my nerves are quite torn to pieces . ’

178805	178833	178834	178834	Kate	210	‘ I am not Sir Mulberry , no , nor Lord Frederick Verisopht , Miss Nickleby , nor am I Mr. Pyke , nor Mr. Pluck either . ’
178861	178875	178877	178878	Mrs Wititterly	374	‘ If such things had been done when I was a young girl , ’

For these reasons , Miss Nickleby , I must tell you once for all , and begging you to mind what I say , that I must insist upon your immediately altering your very forward behaviour to the gentlemen who visit at this house . It really is not becoming , ’
179185	179193	179174	179175	Mrs. Wititterly	374	‘ it is improper -- quite improper . ’

Is it not enough that I should have suffered as I have , night and day ; that I should almost have sunk in my own estimation from very shame of having been brought into contact with such people ; but must I also be exposed to this unjust and most unfounded charge ! ’
179280	179292	179294	179295	Mrs Wititterly	374	‘ You will have the goodness to recollect , Miss Nickleby , ’
179297	179328	179294	179295	Mrs Wititterly	374	‘ that when you use such terms as “ unjust ” , and “ unfounded ” , you charge me , in effect , with stating that which is untrue . ’

179340	179376	179378	179378	Kate	210	‘ Whether you make this accusation of yourself , or at the prompting of others , is alike to me . I say it IS vilely , grossly , wilfully untrue . Is it possible ! ’
179380	179523	179378	179378	Kate	210	‘ that anyone of my own sex can have sat by , and not have seen the misery these men have caused me ? Is it possible that you , ma’am , can have been present , and failed to mark the insulting freedom that their every look bespoke ? Is it possible that you can have avoided seeing , that these libertines , in their utter disrespect for you , and utter disregard of all gentlemanly behaviour , and almost of decency , have had but one object in introducing themselves here , and that the furtherance of their designs upon a friendless , helpless girl , who , without this humiliating confession , might have hoped to receive from one so much her senior something like womanly aid and sympathy ? I do not -- I can not believe it ! ’
179649	179655	179657	179658	Mr. Wititterly	375	‘ What is the matter ? ’
179665	179686	179657	179658	Mr. Wititterly	375	‘ Heavens , what do I see ? Julia ! Julia ! look up , my life , look up ! ’

180412	180421	180423	180423	Ralph	208	‘ I can guess the cause of this ! ’
180435	180450	180452	180452	Ralph	208	‘ I can -- I can -- guess the cause . Well ! Well ! ’
180470	180494	180461	180461	he	208	‘ Where is the harm ? only a few tears ; and it ’s an excellent lesson for her , an excellent lesson . ’
180495	180501	180503	180503	Ralph	208	‘ What is the matter ? ’
180532	180543	180544	180544	she	210	‘ The matter which brings me to you , sir , ’
180547	180597	180544	180544	she	210	‘ is one which should call the blood up into your cheeks , and make you burn to hear , as it does me to tell . I have been wronged ; my feelings have been outraged , insulted , wounded past all healing , and by your friends . ’
180598	180601	180603	180603	Ralph	208	‘ Friends ! ’

180632	180716	180717	180717	Ralph	208	‘ If they were no friends of yours , and you knew what they were,--oh , the more shame on you , uncle , for bringing me among them . To have subjected me to what I was exposed to here , through any misplaced confidence or imperfect knowledge of your guests , would have required some strong excuse ; but if you did it -- as I now believe you did -- knowing them well , it was most dastardly and cruel . ’
180773	180788	180790	180790	Ralph	208	‘ There is some of that boy ’s blood in you , I see , ’
180813	180819	180821	180821	Kate	210	‘ I hope there is ! ’
180823	180884	180821	180821	Kate	210	‘ I should be proud to know it . I am young , uncle , and all the difficulties and miseries of my situation have kept it down , but I have been roused today beyond all endurance , and come what may , I WILL NOT , as I am your brother ’s child , bear these insults longer . ’
180885	180891	180893	180893	Ralph	208	‘ What insults , girl ? ’
180897	180908	180910	180910	Kate	210	‘ Remember what took place here , and ask yourself , ’

You can not tell what the heart of a young girl is -- I have no right to expect you should ; but when I tell you that I am wretched , and that my heart is breaking , I am sure you will help me . I am sure , I am sure you will ! ’
181083	181092	181094	181094	Kate	210	‘ I have gone on day after day , ’

I have had no counsellor , no adviser , no one to protect me . Mama supposes that these are honourable men , rich and distinguished , and how CAN I -- how can I undeceive her -- when she is so happy in these little delusions , which are the only happiness she has ? The lady with whom you placed me , is not the person to whom I could confide matters of so much delicacy , and I have come at last to you , the only friend I have at hand -- almost the only friend I have at all -- to entreat and implore you to assist me . ’
181256	181265	181267	181267	Ralph	208	‘ How can I assist you , child ? ’
181286	181299	181301	181301	Kate	210	‘ You have influence with one of these men , I KNOW , ’
181305	181321	181301	181301	Kate	210	‘ Would not a word from you induce them to desist from this unmanly course ? ’
181322	181325	181327	181327	Ralph	208	‘ No , ’
181332	181348	181327	181327	Ralph	208	‘ at least -- that -- I ca n’t say it , if it would . ’
181349	181355	181301	181301	Kate	210	‘ Ca n’t say it ! ’

181438	181483	181421	181421	himself	208	‘ in business , and I ca n’t afford to offend them . What is it after all ? We have all our trials , and this is one of yours . Some girls would be proud to have such gallants at their feet . ’
181484	181487	181489	181489	Kate	210	‘ Proud ! ’
181491	181497	181499	181499	Ralph	208	‘ I do n’t say , ’
181505	181610	181499	181499	Ralph	208	‘ but that you do right to despise them ; no , you show your good sense in that , as indeed I knew from the first you would . Well . In all other respects you are comfortably bestowed . It ’s not much to bear . If this young lord does dog your footsteps , and whisper his drivelling inanities in your ears , what of it ? It ’s a dishonourable passion . So be it ; it wo n’t last long . Some other novelty will spring up one day , and you will be released . In the mean time-- ’
181611	181617	181619	181619	Kate	210	‘ In the mean time , ’
181627	181796	181619	181619	Kate	210	‘ I am to be the scorn of my own sex , and the toy of the other ; justly condemned by all women of right feeling , and despised by all honest and honourable men ; sunken in my own esteem , and degraded in every eye that looks upon me . No , not if I work my fingers to the bone , not if I am driven to the roughest and hardest labour . Do not mistake me . I will not disgrace your recommendation . I will remain in the house in which it placed me , until I am entitled to leave it by the terms of my engagement ; though , mind , I see these men no more . When I quit it , I will hide myself from them and you , and , striving to support my mother by hard service , I will live , at least , in peace , and trust in God to help me . ’
181889	181893	181895	181895	Newman	211	‘ Do n’t , ’
181910	181919	181895	181895	Newman	211	‘ Do n’t cry , do n’t cry . ’
181941	181948	181951	181951	Noggs	211	‘ I see how it is , ’

182032	182066	182029	182030	Poor thing	4288	’ With these disjointed exclamations , Newman wiped his own eyes with the afore - mentioned duster , and , limping to the street - door , opened it to let her out . ‘
182073	182077	182029	182030	Poor thing	4288	’ whispered Newman . ‘
182105	182106	182107	182107	God	225	’ ‘
182111	182118	182107	182107	God	225	’ answered Kate , hurrying out , ‘

182129	182144	182127	182127	you	210	’ rejoined Newman , opening the door again a little way to say so . ‘
182157	182320	182127	182127	you	210	’ And Newman Noggs opened the door once again to nod cheerfully , and laugh -- and shut it , to shake his head mournfully , and cry . Ralph remained in the same attitude till he heard the noise of the closing door , when he shrugged his shoulders , and after a few turns about the room -- hasty at first , but gradually becoming slower , as he relapsed into himself -- sat down before his desk . It is one of those problems of human nature , which may be noted down , but not solved;--although Ralph felt no remorse at that moment for his conduct towards the innocent , true - hearted girl ; although his libertine clients had done precisely what he had expected , precisely what he most wished , and precisely what would tend most to his advantage , still he hated them for doing it , from the very bottom of his soul . ‘
182323	182348	182127	182127	you	210	’ said Ralph , scowling round , and shaking his clenched hand as the faces of the two profligates rose up before his mind ; ‘
182363	182876	182357	182357	you	4290	’ As the usurer turned for consolation to his books and papers , a performance was going on outside his office door , which would have occasioned him no small surprise , if he could by any means have become acquainted with it . Newman Noggs was the sole actor . He stood at a little distance from the door , with his face towards it ; and with the sleeves of his coat turned back at the wrists , was occupied in bestowing the most vigorous , scientific , and straightforward blows upon the empty air . At first sight , this would have appeared merely a wise precaution in a man of sedentary habits , with the view of opening the chest and strengthening the muscles of the arms . But the intense eagerness and joy depicted in the face of Newman Noggs , which was suffused with perspiration ; the surprising energy with which he directed a constant succession of blows towards a particular panel about five feet eight from the ground , and still worked away in the most untiring and persevering manner , would have sufficiently explained to the attentive observer , that his imagination was thrashing , to within an inch of his life , his body ’s most active employer , Mr. Ralph Nickleby . CHAPTER 29 Of the Proceedings of Nicholas , and certain Internal Divisions in the Company of Mr. Vincent Crummles The unexpected success and favour with which his experiment at Portsmouth had been received , induced Mr. Crummles to prolong his stay in that town for a fortnight beyond the period he had originally assigned for the duration of his visit , during which time Nicholas personated a vast variety of characters with undiminished success , and attracted so many people to the theatre who had never been seen there before , that a benefit was considered by the manager a very promising speculation . Nicholas assenting to the terms proposed , the benefit was had , and by it he realised no less a sum than twenty pounds . Possessed of this unexpected wealth , his first act was to enclose to honest John Browdie the amount of his friendly loan , which he accompanied with many expressions of gratitude and esteem , and many cordial wishes for his matrimonial happiness . To Newman Noggs he forwarded one half of the sum he had realised , entreating him to take an opportunity of handing it to Kate in secret , and conveying to her the warmest assurances of his love and affection . He made no mention of the way in which he had employed himself ; merely informing Newman that a letter addressed to him under his assumed name at the Post Office , Portsmouth , would readily find him , and entreating that worthy friend to write full particulars of the situation of his mother and sister , and an account of all the grand things that Ralph Nickleby had done for them since his departure from London . ‘
182883	182897	182899	182899	I	0	’ said Smike , on the night after the letter had been dispatched . ‘
182901	182921	182922	182922	I	0	’ rejoined Nicholas , with assumed gaiety , for the confession would have made the boy miserable all night ; ‘

182946	182950	182942	182942	she	4292	’ inquired Smike . ‘
182957	182963	182942	182942	she	4292	’ replied Nicholas , laughing , ‘
182970	182971	182954	182954	they	4293	’ ‘
182978	183001	182972	182972	She	4292	’ said Smike , after thinking a little while with his hands folded together , and his eyes bent upon his friend . ‘
183026	183030	183020	183020	you	0	’ said Nicholas . ‘
183040	183048	183031	183031	I	0	’ replied Smike , shaking his head . ‘

183109	183113	183090	183090	you	0	’ asked Smike . ‘

183131	183135	183154	183154	you	0	’ replied Nicholas , ‘

183170	183174	183166	183166	I	0	’ said Smike . ‘
183183	183187	183181	183181	him	4300	’ returned Nicholas . ‘
183222	183223	183225	183225	he	4300	’ ‘
183228	183236	183225	183225	he	4300	’ asked Smike , bending eagerly forward . ‘
183247	183248	183249	183249	Ralph	208	’ ‘
183254	183255	183249	183249	Ralph	208	’ ‘
183259	183263	183264	183264	Ralph	208	’ repeated Smike . ‘
183274	183456	183266	183266	I	0	’ He had muttered it over to himself some twenty times , when a loud knock at the door disturbed him from his occupation . Before he could open it , Mr. Folair , the pantomimist , thrust in his head . Mr. Folair ’s head was usually decorated with a very round hat , unusually high in the crown , and curled up quite tight in the brims . On the present occasion he wore it very much on one side , with the back part forward in consequence of its being the least rusty ; round his neck he wore a flaming red worsted comforter , whereof the straggling ends peeped out beneath his threadbare Newmarket coat , which was very tight and buttoned all the way up . He carried in his hand one very dirty glove , and a cheap dress cane with a glass handle ; in short , his whole appearance was unusually dashing , and demonstrated a far more scrupulous attention to his toilet than he was in the habit of bestowing upon it . ‘
183463	183482	183461	183461	sir	714	’ said Mr. Folair , taking off the tall hat , and running his fingers through his hair . ‘
183490	183491	183488	183488	Hem	233	’ ‘
183498	183502	183503	183503	You	0	’ inquired Nicholas . ‘
183509	183510	183503	183503	You	0	’ ‘
183515	183520	183503	183503	You	0	’ returned Mr. Folair ; ‘
183551	183605	183613	183613	sir	714	’ Mr. Folair paused with a most impressive look , and diving into the hat before noticed , drew from thence a small piece of whity - brown paper curiously folded , whence he brought forth a note which it had served to keep clean , and handing it over to Nicholas , said-- ‘
183615	183882	183613	183613	sir	714	’ Nicholas , in a state of much amazement , took the note and broke the seal , glancing at Mr. Folair as he did so , who , knitting his brow and pursing up his mouth with great dignity , was sitting with his eyes steadily fixed upon the ceiling . It was directed to blank Johnson , Esq . , by favour of Augustus Folair , Esq . ; and the astonishment of Nicholas was in no degree lessened , when he found it to be couched in the following laconic terms:-- “ Mr. Lenville presents his kind regards to Mr. Johnson , and will feel obliged if he will inform him at what hour tomorrow morning it will be most convenient to him to meet Mr. L. at the Theatre , for the purpose of having his nose pulled in the presence of the company . “ Mr. Lenville requests Mr. Johnson not to neglect making an appointment , as he has invited two or three professional friends to witness the ceremony , and can not disappoint them upon any account whatever . “ PORTSMOUTH , TUESDAY NIGHT . ” Indignant as he was at this impertinence , there was something so exquisitely absurd in such a cartel of defiance , that Nicholas was obliged to bite his lip and read the note over two or three times before he could muster sufficient gravity and sternness to address the hostile messenger , who had not taken his eyes from the ceiling , nor altered the expression of his face in the slightest degree . ‘
183894	183901	183884	183884	you	4308	’ he asked , at length . ‘
183904	183926	183884	183884	you	4308	’ rejoined Mr. Folair , looking round for an instant , and immediately carrying his eyes back again to the ceiling . ‘
183937	183958	183930	183930	you	4308	’ asked Nicholas , tearing it into very little pieces , and jerking it in a shower towards the messenger . ‘
183970	183998	183930	183930	you	4308	’ Mr. Folair turned his head -- now ornamented with several fragments of the note -- towards Nicholas , and with the same imperturbable dignity , briefly replied ‘
184001	184002	183930	183930	you	4308	’ ‘
184005	184021	183930	183930	you	4308	’ said Nicholas , taking up the tall hat and tossing it towards the door , ‘

184057	184068	184052	184052	I	0	’ remonstrated Mr. Folair , suddenly losing all his dignity , ‘

184116	184133	184097	184097	you	4308	’ said Mr. Folair , unwinding his comforter , and gradually getting himself out of it . ‘
184140	184141	184097	184097	you	4308	’ ‘
184144	184152	184097	184097	you	4308	’ cried Nicholas , advancing towards him . ‘
184159	184160	184157	184157	sir	714	’ ‘
184169	184184	184165	184165	I	0	’ returned Mr. Folair , waving his hand in deprecation of any further wrath ; ‘
184198	184199	184200	184200	You	714	’ ‘
184213	184217	184206	184206	you	714	’ said Nicholas , ‘

184261	184266	184387	184387	I	0	’ returned the actor ; ‘
184274	184361	184387	184387	I	0	’ Nicholas could not repress a smile at the odd figure before him , which , at all times more calculated to provoke mirth than anger , was especially so at that moment , when with one knee upon the ground , Mr. Folair twirled his old hat round upon his hand , and affected the extremest agony lest any of the nap should have been knocked off -- an ornament which it is almost superfluous to say , it had not boasted for many months . ‘
184366	184376	184364	184364	sir	714	’ said Nicholas , laughing in spite of himself . ‘
184383	184384	184364	184364	sir	714	’ ‘
184395	184410	184387	184387	I	0	’ said Mr. Folair , sitting himself down in a chair with great coolness . ‘
184450	184451	184438	184438	they	4321	’ ‘
184460	184464	184465	184465	Jupiter	456	’ asked Nicholas . ‘
184467	184472	184465	184465	Jupiter	456	’ exclaimed Mr. Folair , ‘

184570	184574	184577	184577	I	0	’ remarked Nicholas . ‘
184592	184600	184577	184577	I	0	’ said Mr. Folair , quite seriously . ‘
184651	184665	184646	184646	he	393	’ said Mr. Folair , stopping to make a calculation in his mind , ‘
184808	184809	184805	184805	you	714	’ ‘
184814	184818	184805	184805	you	714	’ rejoined Nicholas ; ‘

184853	184862	184846	184846	I	0	’ replied Mr. Folair , scratching his head , ‘
184898	184944	184846	184846	I	0	’re always so mild - spoken , and are so popular among the women , that we did n’t suspect you of showing fight . If you did , however , he has a way of getting out of it easily , depend upon that . ’
184945	184949	184951	184951	Nicholas	207	‘ Has he ? ’
184953	184981	184951	184951	Nicholas	207	‘ We will try , tomorrow morning . In the meantime , you can give whatever account of our interview you like best . Good - night . ’
185289	185292	185294	185294	Nicholas	207	‘ Oh ! ’

185839	185842	185844	185844	Nicholas	207	‘ Come , ’
185850	185871	185844	185844	Nicholas	207	‘ apologise for the insolent note you wrote to me last night , and waste no more time in talking . ’
185872	185875	185877	185878	Mr. Lenville	393	‘ Never ! ’

185945	185973	185927	185928	Mr. Lenville	393	‘ The ties of nature are strong . The weak husband and the father -- the father that is yet to be -- relents . I apologise . ’
185974	185979	185981	185981	Nicholas	207	‘ Humbly and submissively ? ’

Be careful , sir , to what lengths your jealousy carries you another time ; and be careful , also , before you venture too far , to ascertain your rival ’s temper . ’
186332	186337	186339	186339	Nicholas	207	‘ Well , Smike , ’

187327	187341	187343	187343	Nicholas	207	‘ But perhaps it may not be my last appearance , you know , ’
187345	187368	187343	187343	Nicholas	207	‘ Unless I am summoned away , I should be sorry to inconvenience you by leaving before the end of the week . ’

187471	187531	187462	187462	his	3395	‘ three is not enough , and it ’s very bungling and irregular not to have more , but if we ca n’t help it we ca n’t , so there ’s no use in talking . A novelty would be very desirable . You could n’t sing a comic song on the pony ’s back , could you ? ’
187532	187535	187537	187537	Nicholas	207	‘ No , ’

187578	187586	187588	187588	Nicholas	207	‘ That it would be rather expensive , ’
187592	187600	187602	187603	Mr. Crummles	381	‘ Eighteen - pence would do it , ’

188053	188069	188071	188071	Nicholas	207	‘ I ’ll tell him presently , for his gratification , that you said so , ’
188073	188079	188081	188082	Miss Snevellicci	394	‘ Oh you naughty thing ! ’
188084	188113	188081	188082	Miss Snevellicci	394	‘ I do n’t know though , that I should much mind HIS knowing my opinion of him ; with some other people , indeed , it might be-- ’
188140	188148	188150	188151	Miss Snevellicci	394	‘ How kind it is of you , ’
188158	188207	188150	188151	Miss Snevellicci	394	‘ to sit waiting here for him night after night , night after night , no matter how tired you are ; and taking so much pains with him , and doing it all with as much delight and readiness as if you were coining gold by it ! ’
188208	188226	188228	188228	Nicholas	207	‘ He well deserves all the kindness I can show him , and a great deal more , ’
188230	188247	188228	188228	Nicholas	207	‘ He is the most grateful , single - hearted , affectionate creature that ever breathed . ’
188248	188254	188256	188257	Miss Snevellicci	394	‘ So odd , too , ’
188259	188264	188256	188257	Miss Snevellicci	394	‘ is n’t he ? ’
188265	188282	188284	188284	Nicholas	207	‘ God help him , and those who have made him so ; he is indeed , ’
188290	188299	188287	188287	his	4393	‘ He is such a devilish close chap , ’
188319	188329	188301	188302	Mr. Folair	390	‘ Nobody can ever get anything out of him . ’
188330	188339	188341	188341	Nicholas	207	‘ What SHOULD they get out of him ? ’
188349	188362	188364	188365	Mr. Folair	390	‘ Zooks ! what a fire - eater you are , Johnson ! ’
188376	188378	188364	188365	Mr. Folair	390	‘ I ’m
188401	188402	188403	188404	Poor fellow	926	’ ‘
188435	188439	188416	188416	he	4395	’ said Nicholas . ‘
188442	188458	188416	188416	he	4395	’ rejoined the actor , contemplating the effect of his face in a lamp reflector , ‘
188469	188470	188416	188416	he	4395	’ ‘
188474	188478	188416	188416	he	4395	’ asked Nicholas . ‘
188507	188521	188492	188492	you	207	’ replied Mr. Folair , delighted with the opportunity of saying something disagreeable . ‘
188529	188530	188492	188492	you	207	’ ‘
188542	188548	188492	188492	you	207	’ said Nicholas , contemptuously . ‘
188557	188562	188492	188492	you	207	’ replied the actor . ‘
188570	188571	188568	188568	Lenville	393	’ ‘
188580	188586	188574	188574	I	0	’ interrupted Nicholas , reddening . ‘
188591	188598	188588	188588	you	207	’ rejoined the immovable Mr. Folair ; ‘
188615	188689	188611	188611	Lenville	393	’re a regular stick of an actor , and that it ’s only the mystery about you that has caused you to go down with the people here , and that Crummles keeps it up for his own sake ; though Lenville says he do n’t believe there ’s anything at all in it , except your having got into a scrape and run away from somewhere , for doing something or other . ’
188690	188693	188695	188695	Nicholas	207	‘ Oh ! ’
188701	188711	188713	188714	Mr. Folair	390	‘ That ’s a part of what he says , ’
188716	188826	188713	188714	Mr. Folair	390	‘ I mention it as the friend of both parties , and in strict confidence . I do n’t agree with him , you know . He says he takes Digby to be more knave than fool ; and old Fluggers , who does the heavy business you know , HE says that when he delivered messages at Covent Garden the season before last , there used to be a pickpocket hovering about the coach - stand who had exactly the face of Digby ; though , as he very properly says , Digby may not be the same , but only his brother , or some near relation . ’
188827	188830	188832	188832	Nicholas	207	‘ Oh ! ’
188835	188838	188840	188841	Mr. Folair	390	‘ Yes , ’
188847	188906	188840	188841	Mr. Folair	390	‘ that ’s what they say . I thought I ’d tell you , because really you ought to know . Oh ! here ’s this blessed phenomenon at last . Ugh , you little imposition , I should like to -- quite ready , my darling,--humbug -- Ring up , Mrs. G. , and let the favourite wake ‘
188909	188935	188840	188841	Mr. Folair	390	’ Uttering in a loud voice such of the latter allusions as were complimentary to the unconscious phenomenon , and giving the rest in a confidential ‘
188937	188987	189012	189012	they	4402	’ to Nicholas , Mr. Folair followed the ascent of the curtain with his eyes , regarded with a sneer the reception of Miss Crummles as the Maiden , and , falling back a step or two to advance with the better effect , uttered a preliminary howl , and ‘
188990	189004	189012	189012	they	4402	’ chattering his teeth and brandishing his tin tomahawk as the Indian Savage . ‘
189024	189028	189012	189012	they	4402	’ thought Nicholas . ‘
189059	189060	189061	189061	You	4405	’ ‘
189075	189085	189067	189069	that malicious creature	4406	’ observed Miss Snevellicci in her most winning tones . ‘
189089	189093	189087	189087	I	0	’ replied Nicholas . ‘
189128	189136	189152	189152	he	340	’ added Nicholas , as Smike approached , ‘

189177	189182	189164	189164	I	0	’ returned Miss Snevellicci . ‘

189219	189222	189224	189225	Miss Ledrook	396	’m sure , ’
189231	189238	189224	189225	Miss Ledrook	396	‘ if YOU ca n’t persuade him-- ’
189265	189287	189289	189290	Miss Snevellicci	394	‘ Mr. and Mrs. Lillyvick have taken lodgings in our house , and share our sitting - room for the present , ’
189292	189299	189289	189290	Miss Snevellicci	394	‘ Wo n’t that induce you ? ’
189300	189303	189305	189305	Nicholas	207	‘ Surely , ’
189307	189318	189305	189305	Nicholas	207	‘ I can require no possible inducement beyond your invitation . ’
189319	189327	189329	189330	Miss Snevellicci	394	‘ Oh no ! I dare say , ’
189337	189342	189333	189334	Miss Ledrook	396	‘ Upon my word ! ’
189385	189388	189390	189391	Miss Ledrook	396	‘ Come , ’
189393	189433	189390	189391	Miss Ledrook	396	‘ it ’s high time we were there , or we shall have poor Mrs. Snevellicci thinking that you have run away with her daughter , Mr. Johnson ; and then we should have a pretty to - do . ’
189434	189439	189441	189442	Miss Snevellicci	394	‘ My dear Led , ’
189444	189450	189441	189442	Miss Snevellicci	394	‘ how you do talk ! ’
189899	189919	189870	189870	he	4427	‘ Now , here I am , my buck , and what have you got to say to me ? ’
190068	190071	190082	190083	Miss Snevellicci	394	‘ Bravo ! ’
190223	190231	190233	190236	Miss Snevellicci ’s papa	394	‘ You have seen him , sir ? ’
190238	190246	190248	190248	Nicholas	207	‘ No , really I never did , ’
190250	190260	190262	190263	Miss Snevellicci	394	‘ You never saw my friend Glavormelly , sir ! ’
190267	190280	190262	190263	Miss Snevellicci	394	‘ Then you have never seen acting yet . If he had lived-- ’
190281	190291	190293	190293	Nicholas	207	‘ Oh , he is dead , is he ? ’
190295	190299	190301	190302	Mr. Snevellicci	465	‘ He is , ’
190304	190346	190301	190302	Mr. Snevellicci	465	‘ but he is n’t in Westminster Abbey , more ’s the shame . He was a-- . Well , no matter . He is gone to that bourne from whence no traveller returns . I hope he is appreciated THERE . ’
190378	190384	190386	190386	Nicholas	207	‘ Well , Mr. Lillyvick , ’
190388	190394	190386	190386	Nicholas	207	‘ and how are you ? ’
190395	190401	190403	190404	the collector	10290	‘ Quite well , sir , ’
190406	190421	190403	190404	the collector	10290	‘ There is nothing like the married state , sir , depend upon it . ’
190422	190425	190427	190427	Nicholas	207	‘ Indeed ! ’
190431	190440	190442	190443	Mr. Lillyvick	316	‘ Ah ! nothing like it , sir , ’
190446	190452	190454	190455	the collector	10290	‘ How do you think , ’
190461	190470	190454	190455	the collector	10290	‘ how do you think she looks tonight ? ’
190471	190477	190479	190479	Nicholas	207	‘ As handsome as ever , ’
190488	190499	190501	190502	the collector	10290	‘ Why , there ’s air about her , sir , ’
190504	190533	190501	190502	the collector	10290	‘ that I never saw in anybody . Look at her now she moves to put the kettle on . There ! Is n’t it fascination , sir ? ’
190534	190536	190501	190502	the collector	10290	‘ You ’re
190541	190545	190537	190539	a lucky man	4452	’ said Nicholas . ‘
190552	190557	190501	190502	the collector	10290	’ rejoined the collector . ‘
190617	190841	190615	190615	you	207	’ With such inquires , and many more such , Mr. Lillyvick jerked his elbow into Nicholas ’s side , and chuckled till his face became quite purple in the attempt to keep down his satisfaction . By this time the cloth had been laid under the joint superintendence of all the ladies , upon two tables put together , one being high and narrow , and the other low and broad . There were oysters at the top , sausages at the bottom , a pair of snuffers in the centre , and baked potatoes wherever it was most convenient to put them . Two additional chairs were brought in from the bedroom : Miss Snevellicci sat at the head of the table , and Mr. Lillyvick at the foot ; and Nicholas had not only the honour of sitting next Miss Snevellicci , but of having Miss Snevellicci ’s mama on his right hand , and Miss Snevellicci ’s papa over the way . In short , he was the hero of the feast ; and when the table was cleared and something warm introduced , Miss Snevellicci ’s papa got up and proposed his health in a speech containing such affecting allusions to his coming departure , that Miss Snevellicci wept , and was compelled to retire into the bedroom . ‘
190852	190863	190874	190874	herself	4454	’ said Miss Ledrook , peeping in from the bedroom . ‘
190878	190962	190874	190874	herself	4454	’ Miss Ledrook eked out this speech with so many mysterious nods and frowns before she shut the door again , that a profound silence came upon all the company , during which Miss Snevellicci ’s papa looked very big indeed -- several sizes larger than life -- at everybody in turn , but particularly at Nicholas , and kept on perpetually emptying his tumbler and filling it again , until the ladies returned in a cluster , with Miss Snevellicci among them . ‘
190974	190979	190971	190972	Mr. Snevellicci	465	’ said Mrs. Lillyvick . ‘
190998	190999	190989	190989	she	4454	’ ‘
191002	191007	190971	190972	Mr. Snevellicci	465	’ said Mr. Snevellicci , ‘

191032	191086	191106	191106	ma’am	8678	’ cried all the ladies together . Now this was not exactly the kind of reply suited to Mr. Snevellicci ’s importance as a man and a father , so he picked out the unfortunate Mrs Snevellicci , and asked her what the devil she meant by talking to him in that way . ‘
191093	191098	191106	191106	ma’am	8678	’ said Mrs. Snevellicci . ‘
191108	191113	191115	191115	you	702	’ said Mr. Snevellicci , ‘

191186	191191	191184	191184	pa	11468	’ rejoined his daughter . ‘
191200	191205	191192	191192	Nobody	8541	’ said Mr. Snevellicci . ‘
191219	191232	191213	191213	Snevellicci	465	’m to be found in Broad Court , Bow Street , when I ’m
191238	191338	191342	191343	Mr. Snevellicci	465	’m not at home , let any man ask for me at the stage - door . Damme , they know me at the stage - door I suppose . Most men have seen my portrait at the cigar shop round the corner . I ’ve been mentioned in the newspapers before now , have n’t I ? Talk ! I ’ll tell you what ; if I found out that any man had been tampering with the affections of my daughter , I would n’t talk . I ’d astonish him without talking ; that ’s my way . ’
191378	191384	191386	191387	Mr. Snevellicci	465	‘ That ’s my way , ’
191515	191523	191498	191498	he	465	‘ The ladies ! Bless their hearts ! ’

191536	191546	191534	191534	em	4467	’ said Mr. Snevellicci , looking round the table , ‘

191556	191561	191563	191564	Mr. Lillyvick	316	‘ Not every one , ’
191568	191574	191576	191577	Mr. Snevellicci	465	‘ Yes , every one , ’
191579	191590	191592	191593	Mr. Lillyvick	316	‘ That would include the married ladies , you know , ’
191595	191603	191605	191606	Mr. Snevellicci	465	‘ I love them too , sir , ’
191626	191633	191608	191609	The collector	10290	‘ This is a nice man ! ’
191652	191659	191661	191662	Mr. Snevellicci	465	‘ One good turn deserves another , ’
191664	191673	191661	191662	Mr. Snevellicci	465	‘ I love them and they love me . ’
191860	191873	191875	191875	Nicholas	207	‘ What is the matter with the men ! Are they mad ? ’
191911	191933	191875	191875	Nicholas	207	‘ What do you mean to do ? What do you want to do ? What is the matter with you ? ’
191961	191967	191969	191970	Mr. Lillyvick	316	‘ Look here , sir , ’
191978	191996	191969	191970	Mr. Lillyvick	316	‘ here is purity and elegance combined , whose feelings have been outraged -- violated , sir ! ’
191997	192005	192007	192008	Mrs. Lillyvick	429	‘ Lor , what nonsense he talks ! ’
192018	192026	192007	192008	Mrs. Lillyvick	429	‘ Nobody has said anything to me . ’
192027	192032	192034	192035	the collector	10290	‘ Said , Henrietta ! ’

192098	192105	192107	192108	the collector	10290	‘ You did n’t mind it ? ’
192110	192114	192107	192108	the collector	10290	‘ Mind it ! ’
192120	192139	192116	192117	Mrs. Lillyvick	429	‘ You ought to go down on your knees and beg everybody ’s pardon , that you ought . ’
192140	192146	192148	192150	the dismayed collector	4478	‘ Pardon , my dear ? ’
192152	192159	192161	192162	Mrs. Lillyvick	429	‘ Yes , and mine first , ’
192164	192183	192161	192162	Mrs. Lillyvick	429	‘ Do you suppose I ai n’t the best judge of what ’s proper and what ’s improper ? ’
192184	192189	192191	192193	all the ladies	2287	‘ To be sure , ’
192195	192220	192191	192193	all the ladies	2287	‘ Do you suppose WE should n’t be the first to speak , if there was anything that ought to be taken notice of ? ’
192221	192232	192234	192237	Miss Snevellicci ’s papa	4427	‘ Do you suppose THEY do n’t know , sir ? ’
192802	192814	192816	192816	Crummles	381	‘ It ’s the phenomenon , depend upon it , sir , ’
192837	192997	192998	192998	Nicholas	207	‘ I have not the smallest doubt it ’s the fame of the phenomenon -- that ’s the man ; him in the great - coat and no shirt - collar . She shall have ten pound a week , Johnson ; she shall not appear on the London boards for a farthing less . They sha n’t engage her either , unless they engage Mrs. Crummles too -- twenty pound a week for the pair ; or I ’ll tell you what , I ’ll throw in myself and the two boys , and they shall have the family for thirty . I ca n’t say fairer than that . They must take us all , if none of us will go without the others . That ’s the way some of the London people do , and it always answers . Thirty pound a week -- it ’s too cheap , Johnson . It ’s dirt cheap . ’
193193	193201	193203	193204	Mr. Crummles	381	‘ Very good , my fine fellow , ’
193218	193227	193207	193207	his	381	‘ you leave this company next Saturday night . ’

193622	193710	193620	193620	Nicholas	207	‘ Heaven knows I have remained here for the best , and sorely against my own will ; but even now I may have dallied too long . What can have happened ? Smike , my good fellow , here -- take my purse . Put our things together , and pay what little debts we owe -- quick , and we shall be in time for the morning coach . I will only tell them that we are going , and will return to you immediately . ’
193889	193893	193895	193895	Nicholas	207	‘ So goodbye , ’
193897	193902	193895	193895	Nicholas	207	‘ goodbye , goodbye . ’
193925	193932	193934	193934	Nicholas	207	‘ I ca n’t help it , ’
193936	193966	193934	193934	Nicholas	207	‘ Set whatever I may have earned this week against them , or if that will not repay you , say at once what will . Quick , quick . ’
193967	193975	193977	193977	Crummles	381	‘ We ’ll cry quits about that , ’
193979	193990	193977	193977	Crummles	381	‘ But ca n’t we have one last night more ? ’
193991	194000	194002	194002	Nicholas	207	‘ Not an hour -- not a minute , ’
194006	194018	194020	194021	the manager	3395	‘ Wo n’t you stop to say something to Mrs. Crummles ? ’
194030	194047	194049	194049	Nicholas	207	‘ I could n’t stop if it were to prolong my life a score of years , ’
194051	194073	194049	194049	Nicholas	207	‘ Here , take my hand , and with it my hearty thanks.--Oh ! that I should have been fooling here ! ’
194109	194116	194118	194119	Mr. Crummles	381	‘ Dear me , dear me , ’
194133	194192	194118	194119	Mr. Crummles	381	‘ if he only acted like that , what a deal of money he ’d draw ! He should have kept upon this circuit ; he ’d have been very useful to me . But he do n’t know what ’s good for him . He is an impetuous youth . Young men are rash , very rash . ’
194488	194499	194484	194485	Mr. Crummles	381	‘ It is he -- my friend , my friend ! ’
194500	194505	194507	194507	Nicholas	207	‘ Bless my heart , ’
194516	194522	194507	194507	Nicholas	207	‘ what are you about ? ’
194543	194555	194539	194539	he	3395	‘ Farewell , my noble , my lion - hearted boy ! ’
195031	195045	195047	195047	Ralph	208	‘ I am not a man to be moved by a pretty face , ’
195050	195130	195047	195047	Ralph	208	‘ There is a grinning skull beneath it , and men like me who look and work below the surface see that , and not its delicate covering . And yet I almost like the girl , or should if she had been less proudly and squeamishly brought up . If the boy were drowned or hanged , and the mother dead , this house should be her home . I wish they were , with all my soul . ’
195558	195562	195564	195564	Ralph	208	‘ How now ? ’
195566	195569	195571	195571	Newman	211	‘ Oh ! ’
195590	195596	195571	195571	Newman	211	‘ I thought you rang . ’
195608	195611	195613	195613	Ralph	208	‘ Stop ! ’
195623	195628	195615	195615	Newman	211	‘ I did ring . ’
195629	195635	195571	195571	Newman	211	‘ I knew you did . ’
195636	195649	195615	195615	Newman	211	‘ Then why do you offer to go if you know that ? ’
195650	195662	195664	195664	Newman	211	‘ I thought you rang to say you did n’t ring , ’
195666	195671	195664	195664	Newman	211	‘ You often do . ’
195672	195688	195690	195690	Ralph	208	‘ How dare you pry , and peer , and stare at me , sirrah ? ’
195692	195695	195697	195697	Newman	211	‘ Stare ! ’
195699	195707	195697	195697	Newman	211	‘ at YOU ! Ha , ha ! ’
195718	195724	195726	195726	Ralph	208	‘ Be careful , sir , ’
195733	195748	195726	195726	Ralph	208	‘ Let me have no drunken fooling here . Do you see this parcel ? ’
195749	195755	195757	195757	Newman	211	‘ It ’s big enough , ’
195759	195784	195785	195785	Newman	211	‘ Carry it into the city ; to Cross , in Broad Street , and leave it there -- quick . Do you hear ? ’
196099	196102	196094	196094	Newman	211	‘ Noggs , ’
196148	196155	196157	196159	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ Walk in if you please , ’
196176	196180	196182	196184	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ Bless us ! ’
196192	196200	196182	196184	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ what did you want , sir ? ’
196201	196207	196209	196209	Newman	211	‘ You have forgotten me , ’
196218	196255	196209	196209	Newman	211	‘ I wonder at that . That nobody should remember me who knew me in other days , is natural enough ; but there are few people who , seeing me once , forget me NOW . ’
196277	196286	196288	196290	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ I did forget you , I declare , ’
196304	196352	196295	196295	Newman	211	‘ and I am ashamed of myself for doing so ; for you are a kind , good creature , Mr. Noggs . Sit down and tell me all about Miss Nickleby . Poor dear thing ! I have n’t seen her for this many a week . ’
196353	196358	196360	196360	Newman	211	‘ How ’s that ? ’
196362	196372	196374	196376	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ Why , the truth is , Mr. Noggs , ’
196378	196398	196374	196376	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ that I have been out on a visit -- the first visit I have made for fifteen years . ’
196399	196406	196408	196408	Newman	211	‘ That is a long time , ’
196412	196446	196448	196450	the miniature painter	1905	‘ So it is a very long time to look back upon in years , though , somehow or other , thank Heaven , the solitary days roll away peacefully and happily enough , ’
196452	196614	196616	196618	the miniature painter	1905	‘ I have a brother , Mr Noggs -- the only relation I have -- and all that time I never saw him once . Not that we ever quarrelled , but he was apprenticed down in the country , and he got married there ; and new ties and affections springing up about him , he forgot a poor little woman like me , as it was very reasonable he should , you know . Do n’t suppose that I complain about that , because I always said to myself , “ It is very natural ; poor dear John is making his way in the world , and has a wife to tell his cares and troubles to , and children now to play about him , so God bless him and them , and send we may all meet together one day where we shall part no more . ” But what do you think , Mr. Noggs , ’
196627	196829	196616	196618	the miniature painter	1905	‘ of that very same brother coming up to London at last , and never resting till he found me out ; what do you think of his coming here and sitting down in that very chair , and crying like a child because he was so glad to see me -- what do you think of his insisting on taking me down all the way into the country to his own house ( quite a sumptuous place , Mr. Noggs , with a large garden and I do n’t know how many fields , and a man in livery waiting at table , and cows and horses and pigs and I do n’t know what besides ) , and making me stay a whole month , and pressing me to stop there all my life -- yes , all my life -- and so did his wife , and so did the children -- and there were four of them , and one , the eldest girl of all , they -- they had named her after me eight good years before , they had indeed . I never was so happy ; in all my life I never was ! ’
196865	196871	196873	196875	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ But bless my life , ’
196898	196938	196890	196890	her	222	‘ what a foolish creature I must seem to you , Mr. Noggs ! I should n’t have said anything about it , only I wanted to explain to you how it was I had n’t seen Miss Nickleby . ’
196939	196947	196949	196949	Newman	211	‘ Have you seen the old lady ? ’
196951	196957	196959	196961	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ You mean Mrs. Nickleby ? ’
196963	197091	196959	196961	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ Then I tell you what , Mr Noggs , if you want to keep in the good books in that quarter , you had better not call her the old lady any more , for I suspect she would n’t be best pleased to hear you . Yes , I went there the night before last , but she was quite on the high ropes about something , and was so grand and mysterious , that I could n’t make anything of her : so , to tell you the truth , I took it into my head to be grand too , and came away in state . I thought she would have come round again before this , but she has n’t been here . ’
197092	197096	197098	197098	Newman	211	‘ About Miss Nickleby-- ’
197100	197112	197098	197098	Newman	211	‘ Why , she was here twice while I was away , ’
197118	197165	197114	197116	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ I was afraid she might n’t like to have me calling on her among those great folks in what’s - its - name Place , so I thought I ’d wait a day or two , and if I did n’t see her , write . ’
197166	197169	197171	197171	Newman	211	‘ Ah ! ’
197177	197192	197194	197196	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ However , I want to hear all the news about them from you , ’
197198	197244	197194	197196	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ How is the old rough and tough monster of Golden Square ? Well , of course ; such people always are . I do n’t mean how is he in health , but how is he going on : how is he behaving himself ? ’
197245	197249	197251	197251	Newman	211	‘ Damn him ! ’
197261	197267	197251	197251	Newman	211	‘ like a false hound . ’
197268	197279	197281	197283	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ Gracious , Mr. Noggs , you quite terrify me ! ’
197288	197304	197306	197306	Newman	211	‘ I should have spoilt his features yesterday afternoon if I could have afforded it , ’
197326	197346	197314	197314	his	211	‘ I was very near it . I was obliged to put my hands in my pockets , and keep ‘
197407	197413	197406	197406	I	0	’m quite certain of it . ’
197414	197428	197430	197432	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ I shall scream if you do n’t compose yourself , Mr. Noggs , ’
197434	197436	197430	197432	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ I ’m
197447	197448	197438	197438	I	0	’ ‘
197452	197462	197438	197438	I	0	’ rejoined Newman , darting violently to and fro . ‘
197522	197592	197519	197520	the rascal	4597	’ Lashing himself up to an extravagant pitch of fury , Newman Noggs jerked himself about the room with the most eccentric motion ever beheld in a human being : now sparring at the little miniatures on the wall , and now giving himself violent thumps on the head , as if to heighten the delusion , until he sank down in his former seat quite breathless and exhausted . ‘
197595	197604	197519	197520	the rascal	4597	’ said Newman , picking up his hat ; ‘
197613	197625	197612	197612	I	0	’m better , and I ’ll tell you all about it . ’
197775	197783	197785	197787	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ God forgive me for saying so , ’
197801	197817	197785	197787	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ but I really feel as if I could stick this into him with pleasure . ’
197898	197909	197911	197911	Newman	211	‘ She wo n’t stop where she is after tonight , ’
197913	197919	197911	197911	Newman	211	‘ That ’s a comfort . ’
197920	197923	197925	197927	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ Stop ! ’
197929	197939	197925	197927	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ she should have left there , weeks ago . ’
197940	197948	197950	197950	Newman	211	‘ --If we had known of this , ’
197952	197987	197950	197950	Newman	211	‘ But we did n’t . Nobody could properly interfere but her mother or brother . The mother ’s weak -- poor thing -- weak . The dear young man will be here tonight . ’
197988	197992	197994	197996	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ Heart alive ! ’
197998	198016	197994	197996	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ He will do something desperate , Mr Noggs , if you tell him all at once . ’
198030	198035	198037	198039	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ Depend upon it , ’
198043	198090	198037	198039	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ if you are not very careful in breaking out the truth to him , he will do some violence upon his uncle or one of these men that will bring some terrible calamity upon his own head , and grief and sorrow to us all . ’
198091	198098	198100	198100	Newman	211	‘ I never thought of that , ’
198109	198127	198102	198102	his	211	‘ I came to ask you to receive his sister in case he brought her here , but-- ’
198128	198139	198141	198143	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ But this is a matter of much greater importance , ’
198145	198175	198141	198143	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ that you might have been sure of before you came , but the end of this , nobody can foresee , unless you are very guarded and careful . ’
198176	198182	198184	198184	Newman	211	‘ What CAN I do ? ’
198198	198206	198187	198187	his	211	‘ If he was to talk of pistoling ‘
198221	198226	198227	198229	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ em right . ” ’
198296	198310	198312	198314	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ He must have time to cool before he can possibly do anything , ’
198316	198334	198312	198314	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ That is of the greatest consequence . He must not be told until late at night . ’
198335	198349	198351	198351	Newman	211	‘ But he ’ll be in town between six and seven this evening , ’
198353	198366	198351	198351	Newman	211	‘ I ca n’t keep it from him when he asks me . ’
198367	198377	198379	198381	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ Then you must go out , Mr. Noggs , ’
198383	198402	198379	198381	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ You can easily have been kept away by business , and must not return till nearly midnight . ’
198403	198411	198413	198413	Newman	211	‘ Then he will come straight here , ’
198415	198420	198422	198424	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ So I suppose , ’
198426	198477	198422	198424	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ but he wo n’t find me at home , for I ’ll go straight to the city the instant you leave me , make up matters with Mrs. Nickleby , and take her away to the theatre , so that he may not even know where his sister lives . ’
198583	198588	198590	198590	Nicholas	207	‘ London at last ! ’
198604	198617	198637	198637	his	1182	‘ It seemed to me as though we should never reach it . ’
198618	198630	198632	198633	the coachman	1182	‘ And yet you came along at a tidy pace too , ’
198649	198656	198637	198637	his	1182	‘ Ay , I know that , ’
198661	198684	198637	198637	his	1182	‘ but I have been very anxious to be at my journey ’s end , and that makes the way seem long . ’
198685	198688	198690	198691	the coachman	1182	‘ Well , ’
198693	198716	198690	198691	the coachman	1182	‘ if the way seemed long with such cattle as you ’ve sat behind , you MUST have been most uncommon anxious ; ’
198777	199385	199387	199387	you	4608	’ glaring lights , and illuminated besides with the brilliant flood that streamed from the windows of the shops , where sparkling jewellery , silks and velvets of the richest colours , the most inviting delicacies , and most sumptuous articles of luxurious ornament , succeeded each other in rich and glittering profusion . Streams of people apparently without end poured on and on , jostling each other in the crowd and hurrying forward , scarcely seeming to notice the riches that surrounded them on every side ; while vehicles of all shapes and makes , mingled up together in one moving mass , like running water , lent their ceaseless roar to swell the noise and tumult . As they dashed by the quickly - changing and ever - varying objects , it was curious to observe in what a strange procession they passed before the eye . Emporiums of splendid dresses , the materials brought from every quarter of the world ; tempting stores of everything to stimulate and pamper the sated appetite and give new relish to the oft - repeated feast ; vessels of burnished gold and silver , wrought into every exquisite form of vase , and dish , and goblet ; guns , swords , pistols , and patent engines of destruction ; screws and irons for the crooked , clothes for the newly - born , drugs for the sick , coffins for the dead , and churchyards for the buried -- all these jumbled each with the other and flocking side by side , seemed to flit by in motley dance like the fantastic groups of the old Dutch painter , and with the same stern moral for the unheeding restless crowd . Nor were there wanting objects in the crowd itself to give new point and purpose to the shifting scene . The rags of the squalid ballad - singer fluttered in the rich light that showed the goldsmith ’s treasures , pale and pinched - up faces hovered about the windows where was tempting food , hungry eyes wandered over the profusion guarded by one thin sheet of brittle glass -- an iron wall to them ; half - naked shivering figures stopped to gaze at Chinese shawls and golden stuffs of India . There was a christening party at the largest coffin - maker ’s and a funeral hatchment had stopped some great improvements in the bravest mansion . Life and death went hand in hand ; wealth and poverty stood side by side ; repletion and starvation laid them down together . But it was London ; and the old country lady inside , who had put her head out of the coach - window a mile or two this side Kingston , and cried out to the driver that she was sure he must have passed it and forgotten to set her down , was satisfied at last . Nicholas engaged beds for himself and Smike at the inn where the coach stopped , and repaired , without the delay of another moment , to the lodgings of Newman Noggs ; for his anxiety and impatience had increased with every succeeding minute , and were almost beyond control . There was a fire in Newman ’s garret ; and a candle had been left burning ; the floor was cleanly swept , the room was as comfortably arranged as such a room could be , and meat and drink were placed in order upon the table . Everything bespoke the affectionate care and attention of Newman Noggs , but Newman himself was not there . ‘
199396	199410	199387	199387	you	4608	’ inquired Nicholas , tapping at the door of Newman ’s front neighbour . ‘
199416	199423	199387	199387	you	4608	’ said Crowl , presenting himself . ‘
199431	199439	199446	199446	Nicholas	207	’re looking ! I never could have believed-- ’
199440	199444	199446	199446	Nicholas	207	‘ Pardon me , ’
199448	199459	199446	199446	Nicholas	207	‘ My question -- I am extremely anxious to know . ’
199460	199471	199473	199473	Crowl	308	‘ Why , he has a troublesome affair of business , ’
199475	199539	199473	199473	Crowl	308	‘ and will not be home before twelve o’clock . He was very unwilling to go , I can tell you , but there was no help for it . However , he left word that you were to make yourself comfortable till he came back , and that I was to entertain you , which I shall be very glad to do . ’
200181	200190	200192	200192	Nicholas	207	‘ An expensive place , I dare say , ’
200194	200219	200192	200192	Nicholas	207	‘ but a pint of wine and a biscuit are no great debauch wherever they are had . And yet I do n’t know . ’

200826	200832	200834	200834	Nicholas	207	‘ It is remarkable too , ’
200836	200866	200834	200834	Nicholas	207	‘ if it had been “ Kate ” or “ Kate Nickleby , ” I should not have been so much surprised : but “ little Kate Nickleby ! ” ’
200893	200898	200900	200903	the voice behind him	4657	‘ Little Kate Nickleby ! ’
200905	200910	200912	200912	Nicholas	207	‘ I was right , ’
200921	200930	200912	200912	Nicholas	207	‘ And it was the man I supposed . ’
200931	200946	200948	200949	the voice	832	‘ As there was a proper objection to drinking her in heel - taps , ’
200951	200968	200948	200949	the voice	832	‘ we ’ll give her the first glass in the new magnum . Little Kate Nickleby ! ’
200969	200974	200976	200978	the other three	4659	‘ Little Kate Nickleby , ’
201034	201038	201017	201017	he	714	‘ The jade ! ’
201048	201106	201017	201017	he	714	‘ She ’s a true Nickleby -- a worthy imitator of her old uncle Ralph -- she hangs back to be more sought after -- so does he ; nothing to be got out of Ralph unless you follow him up , and then the money comes doubly welcome , and the bargain doubly hard , for you ’re
201118	201119	201017	201017	he	714	’ ‘
201123	201188	201017	201017	he	714	’ echoed two voices . Nicholas was in a perfect agony as the two elderly gentlemen opposite , rose one after the other and went away , lest they should be the means of his losing one word of what was said . But the conversation was suspended as they withdrew , and resumed with even greater freedom when they had left the room . ‘
201193	201199	201189	201189	I	0	’ said the younger gentleman , ‘
201225	201226	201201	201203	the old woman	12062	’ ‘
201244	201249	201250	201250	I	0	’ said the first . ‘
201267	201268	201263	201263	I	0	’ ‘
201274	201280	201263	201263	I	0	’ returned the other voice . ‘
201290	201513	201263	201263	I	0	’ The laugh was taken up by the two voices which always came in together , and became general at Mrs. Nickleby ’s expense . Nicholas turned burning hot with rage , but he commanded himself for the moment , and waited to hear more . What he heard need not be repeated here . Suffice it that as the wine went round he heard enough to acquaint him with the characters and designs of those whose conversation he overhead ; to possess him with the full extent of Ralph ’s villainy , and the real reason of his own presence being required in London . He heard all this and more . He heard his sister ’s sufferings derided , and her virtuous conduct jeered at and brutally misconstrued ; he heard her name bandied from mouth to mouth , and herself made the subject of coarse and insolent wagers , free speech , and licentious jesting . The man who had spoken first , led the conversation , and indeed almost engrossed it , being only stimulated from time to time by some slight observation from one or other of his companions . To him then Nicholas addressed himself when he was sufficiently composed to stand before the party , and force the words from his parched and scorching throat . ‘
201524	201528	201532	201532	sir	714	’ said Nicholas . ‘
201534	201546	201532	201532	sir	714	’ retorted Sir Mulberry Hawk , eyeing him in disdainful surprise . ‘
201552	201567	201568	201570	A mysterious stranger	4671	’ replied Nicholas , speaking with great difficulty , for his passion choked him . ‘
201576	201597	201568	201570	A mysterious stranger	4671	’ exclaimed Sir Mulberry , raising his wine - glass to his lips , and looking round upon his friends . ‘
201614	201655	201658	201658	sir	714	’ said Nicholas sternly . Sir Mulberry merely paused in the act of drinking , and bade him either name his business or leave the table . Nicholas drew a card from his pocket , and threw it before him . ‘
201660	201664	201658	201658	sir	714	’ said Nicholas ; ‘
201671	201735	201736	201736	Your	0	’ A momentary expression of astonishment , not unmixed with some confusion , appeared in the face of Sir Mulberry as he read the name ; but he subdued it in an instant , and tossing the card to Lord Verisopht , who sat opposite , drew a toothpick from a glass before him , and very leisurely applied it to his mouth . ‘
201741	201752	201736	201736	Your	0	’ said Nicholas , turning paler as his passion kindled . ‘
201759	201764	201753	201753	I	0	’ replied Sir Mulberry . ‘
201774	201792	201793	201793	he	4673	’ said Nicholas , looking round and scarcely able to make his white lips form the words , ‘
201806	201813	201793	201793	he	4673	’ There was a dead silence . ‘
201831	201835	201816	201829	the brother of the young lady who has been the subject of conversation here	4675	’ said Nicholas . ‘
201892	201907	201909	201910	the fellow	4682	’ Sir Mulberry looked at him contemptuously , and , addressing his companions , said-- ‘
201942	201943	201944	201944	You	0	’ ‘
201952	201956	201944	201944	You	0	’ said Nicholas , ‘
201984	202045	201971	201971	I	0	’ Sir Mulberry ’s hand involuntarily closed upon the decanter , and he seemed for an instant about to launch it at the head of his challenger . But he only filled his glass , and laughed in derision . Nicholas sat himself down , directly opposite to the party , and , summoning the waiter , paid his bill . ‘
202054	202098	202047	202047	you	0	’ he inquired of the man in an audible voice ; pointing out Sir Mulberry as he put the question . Sir Mulberry laughed again , and the two voices which had always spoken together , echoed the laugh ; but rather feebly . ‘
202104	202137	202140	202140	sir	714	’ replied the waiter , who , no doubt , knew his cue , and answered with just as little respect , and just as much impertinence as he could safely show : ‘
202148	202149	202142	202142	I	0	’ ‘
202155	202166	202168	202168	you	0	’ cried Sir Mulberry , as the man was retiring ; ‘
202175	202176	202168	202168	you	0	’ ‘
202185	202186	202183	202183	sir	714	’ ‘
202194	202206	202188	202188	you	0	’ said Sir Mulberry , throwing Nicholas ’s card towards him ; ‘
202231	202710	202227	202227	you	0	’ The man grinned , and , looking doubtfully at Nicholas , compromised the matter by sticking the card in the chimney - glass . Having done this , he retired . Nicholas folded his arms , and biting his lip , sat perfectly quiet ; sufficiently expressing by his manner , however , a firm determination to carry his threat of following Sir Mulberry home , into steady execution . It was evident from the tone in which the younger member of the party appeared to remonstrate with his friend , that he objected to this course of proceeding , and urged him to comply with the request which Nicholas had made . Sir Mulberry , however , who was not quite sober , and who was in a sullen and dogged state of obstinacy , soon silenced the representations of his weak young friend , and further seemed -- as if to save himself from a repetition of them -- to insist on being left alone . However this might have been , the young gentleman and the two who had always spoken together , actually rose to go after a short interval , and presently retired , leaving their friend alone with Nicholas . It will be very readily supposed that to one in the condition of Nicholas , the minutes appeared to move with leaden wings indeed , and that their progress did not seem the more rapid from the monotonous ticking of a French clock , or the shrill sound of its little bell which told the quarters . But there he sat ; and in his old seat on the opposite side of the room reclined Sir Mulberry Hawk , with his legs upon the cushion , and his handkerchief thrown negligently over his knees : finishing his magnum of claret with the utmost coolness and indifference . Thus they remained in perfect silence for upwards of an hour -- Nicholas would have thought for three hours at least , but that the little bell had only gone four times . Twice or thrice he looked angrily and impatiently round ; but there was Sir Mulberry in the same attitude , putting his glass to his lips from time to time , and looking vacantly at the wall , as if he were wholly ignorant of the presence of any living person . At length he yawned , stretched himself , and rose ; walked coolly to the glass , and having surveyed himself therein , turned round and honoured Nicholas with a long and contemptuous stare . Nicholas stared again with right good - will ; Sir Mulberry shrugged his shoulders , smiled slightly , rang the bell , and ordered the waiter to help him on with his greatcoat . The man did so , and held the door open . ‘
202715	202864	202227	202227	you	0	’ said Sir Mulberry ; and they were alone again . Sir Mulberry took several turns up and down the room , whistling carelessly all the time ; stopped to finish the last glass of claret which he had poured out a few minutes before , walked again , put on his hat , adjusted it by the glass , drew on his gloves , and , at last , walked slowly out . Nicholas , who had been fuming and chafing until he was nearly wild , darted from his seat , and followed him : so closely , that before the door had swung upon its hinges after Sir Mulberry ’s passing out , they stood side by side in the street together . There was a private cabriolet in waiting ; the groom opened the apron , and jumped out to the horse ’s head . ‘
202873	202881	202866	202866	you	4701	’ asked Nicholas in a suppressed voice . ‘
202884	202898	202866	202866	you	4701	’ replied the other fiercely , and confirming the refusal with an oath . ‘
202901	202902	202866	202866	you	4701	’ ‘
202918	202922	202912	202912	you	4701	’ said Nicholas . ‘
202943	202944	202934	202934	I	0	’ ‘
202953	202958	202945	202945	You	4701	’ returned Sir Mulberry . ‘
202964	202968	202959	202959	You	4701	’ said Nicholas . ‘
202980	202986	202977	202977	I	0	’ said Sir Mulberry Hawk . ‘
202996	203000	203001	203001	your	4701	’ returned Nicholas , ‘
203042	203043	203032	203032	you	4701	’ ‘
203056	203068	203075	203075	dog	4709	’ returned Sir Mulberry , taking the reins in his hand . ‘
203084	203085	203077	203077	William	242	’ ‘
203091	203111	203086	203086	You	4701	’ cried Nicholas , springing on the step as Sir Mulberry jumped in , and catching at the reins . ‘
203143	203174	203135	203135	you	4701	’ The groom hesitated , for the mare , who was a high - spirited animal and thorough - bred , plunged so violently that he could scarcely hold her . ‘
203182	203237	203178	203178	I	0	’ thundered his master . The man obeyed . The animal reared and plunged as though it would dash the carriage into a thousand pieces , but Nicholas , blind to all sense of danger , and conscious of nothing but his fury , still maintained his place and his hold upon the reins . ‘
203244	203245	203239	203239	you	4701	’ ‘
203254	203255	203247	203247	you	4701	’ ‘
203258	203259	203247	203247	you	4701	’ ‘
203262	203723	203247	203247	you	4701	’ In less time than the quickest tongue could tell it , these words were exchanged , and Sir Mulberry shortening his whip , applied it furiously to the head and shoulders of Nicholas . It was broken in the struggle ; Nicholas gained the heavy handle , and with it laid open one side of his antagonist ’s face from the eye to the lip . He saw the gash ; knew that the mare had darted off at a wild mad gallop ; a hundred lights danced in his eyes , and he felt himself flung violently upon the ground . He was giddy and sick , but staggered to his feet directly , roused by the loud shouts of the men who were tearing up the street , and screaming to those ahead to clear the way . He was conscious of a torrent of people rushing quickly by -- looking up , could discern the cabriolet whirled along the foot - pavement with frightful rapidity -- then heard a loud cry , the smashing of some heavy body , and the breaking of glass -- and then the crowd closed in in the distance , and he could see or hear no more . The general attention had been entirely directed from himself to the person in the carriage , and he was quite alone . Rightly judging that under such circumstances it would be madness to follow , he turned down a bye - street in search of the nearest coach - stand , finding after a minute or two that he was reeling like a drunken man , and aware for the first time of a stream of blood that was trickling down his face and breast . CHAPTER 33 In which Mr. Ralph Nickleby is relieved , by a very expeditious Process , from all Commerce with his Relations Smike and Newman Noggs , who in his impatience had returned home long before the time agreed upon , sat before the fire , listening anxiously to every footstep on the stairs , and the slightest sound that stirred within the house , for the approach of Nicholas . Time had worn on , and it was growing late . He had promised to be back in an hour ; and his prolonged absence began to excite considerable alarm in the minds of both , as was abundantly testified by the blank looks they cast upon each other at every new disappointment . At length a coach was heard to stop , and Newman ran out to light Nicholas up the stairs . Beholding him in the trim described at the conclusion of the last chapter , he stood aghast in wonder and consternation . ‘
203729	203740	203247	203247	you	4701	’ said Nicholas , hurrying him back into the room . ‘
203756	203757	203247	203247	you	4701	’ ‘
203761	203789	203247	203247	you	4701	’ cried Newman , passing his hands hastily over the back and arms of Nicholas , as if to assure himself that he had broken no bones . ‘
203796	203797	203792	203792	you	4710	’ ‘
203802	203806	203792	203792	you	4710	’ interrupted Nicholas ; ‘
203875	203876	203877	203877	Your	0	’ ‘
203898	203902	203890	203890	I	0	’ said Newman . ‘
203911	203912	203913	203913	I	0	’ ‘
203933	203943	203913	203913	I	0	’ said Nicholas , seating himself with some difficulty . ‘
203978	203988	203989	203989	You	0	’ said Nicholas , giving his hand to Noggs . ‘
204021	204022	204019	204019	Newman	211	’ ‘
204031	204035	204028	204028	I	0	’ said Noggs . ‘
204044	204634	204028	204028	I	0	’ Newman did so . Nicholas nodded his head from time to time , as it corroborated the particulars he had already gleaned ; but he fixed his eyes upon the fire , and did not look round once . His recital ended , Newman insisted upon his young friend ’s stripping off his coat and allowing whatever injuries he had received to be properly tended . Nicholas , after some opposition , at length consented , and , while some pretty severe bruises on his arms and shoulders were being rubbed with oil and vinegar , and various other efficacious remedies which Newman borrowed from the different lodgers , related in what manner they had been received . The recital made a strong impression on the warm imagination of Newman ; for when Nicholas came to the violent part of the quarrel , he rubbed so hard , as to occasion him the most exquisite pain , which he would not have exhibited , however , for the world , it being perfectly clear that , for the moment , Newman was operating on Sir Mulberry Hawk , and had quite lost sight of his real patient . This martyrdom over , Nicholas arranged with Newman that while he was otherwise occupied next morning , arrangements should be made for his mother ’s immediately quitting her present residence , and also for dispatching Miss La Creevy to break the intelligence to her . He then wrapped himself in Smike ’s greatcoat , and repaired to the inn where they were to pass the night , and where ( after writing a few lines to Ralph , the delivery of which was to be intrusted to Newman next day ) , he endeavoured to obtain the repose of which he stood so much in need . Drunken men , they say , may roll down precipices , and be quite unconscious of any serious personal inconvenience when their reason returns . The remark may possibly apply to injuries received in other kinds of violent excitement : certain it is , that although Nicholas experienced some pain on first awakening next morning , he sprung out of bed as the clock struck seven , with very little difficulty , and was soon as much on the alert as if nothing had occurred . Merely looking into Smike ’s room , and telling him that Newman Noggs would call for him very shortly , Nicholas descended into the street , and calling a hackney coach , bade the man drive to Mrs. Wititterly ’s , according to the direction which Newman had given him on the previous night . It wanted a quarter to eight when they reached Cadogan Place . Nicholas began to fear that no one might be stirring at that early hour , when he was relieved by the sight of a female servant , employed in cleaning the door - steps . By this functionary he was referred to the doubtful page , who appeared with dishevelled hair and a very warm and glossy face , as of a page who had just got out of bed . By this young gentleman he was informed that Miss Nickleby was then taking her morning ’s walk in the gardens before the house . On the question being propounded whether he could go and find her , the page desponded and thought not ; but being stimulated with a shilling , the page grew sanguine and thought he could . ‘
204653	204721	204637	204638	Miss Nickleby	226	’ said Nicholas . The plated buttons disappeared with an alacrity most unusual to them , and Nicholas paced the room in a state of feverish agitation which made the delay even of a minute insupportable . He soon heard a light footstep which he well knew , and before he could advance to meet her , Kate had fallen on his neck and burst into tears . ‘
204726	204734	204637	204638	Miss Nickleby	226	’ said Nicholas as he embraced her . ‘
204740	204741	204637	204638	Miss Nickleby	226	’ ‘
204752	204757	204637	204638	Miss Nickleby	226	’ sobbed poor Kate ; ‘
204782	204783	204784	204784	I	0	’ ‘
204790	204797	204798	204798	he	0	’ answered Nicholas--‘never again , Kate , ’
204814	204868	204807	204807	he	0	‘ Tell me that I acted for the best . Tell me that we parted because I feared to bring misfortune on your head ; that it was a trial to me no less than to yourself , and that if I did wrong it was in ignorance of the world and unknowingly . ’
204869	204881	204883	204883	Kate	210	‘ Why should I tell you what we know so well ? ’
204886	204899	204883	204883	Kate	210	‘ Nicholas -- dear Nicholas -- how can you give way thus ? ’
204900	204915	204917	204918	her brother	8977	‘ It is such bitter reproach to me to know what you have undergone , ’
204920	204937	204939	204939	Nicholas	207	‘ to see you so much altered , and yet so kind and patient -- God ! ’
204952	204999	204939	204939	Nicholas	207	‘ it sets my whole blood on fire again . You must leave here with me directly ; you should not have slept here last night , but that I knew all this too late . To whom can I speak , before we drive away ? ’
205038	205044	205046	205047	Mr. Wititterly	375	‘ The quarter ’s notice , ’
205060	205068	205046	205047	Mr. Wititterly	375	‘ is not yet half expired . Therefore-- ’
205069	205072	205074	205074	Nicholas	207	‘ Therefore , ’
205076	205138	205074	205074	Nicholas	207	‘ the quarter ’s salary must be lost , sir . You will excuse this extreme haste , but circumstances require that I should immediately remove my sister , and I have not a moment ’s time to lose . Whatever she brought here I will send for , if you will allow me , in the course of the day . ’
205185	205197	205199	205200	Mr. Wititterly	375	‘ With regard to the trifle of salary that is due , ’
205202	205222	205199	205200	Mr. Wititterly	375	‘ I will’--here he was interrupted by a violent fit of coughing--‘I will -- owe it to Miss Nickleby . ’
205262	205267	205269	205269	Nicholas	207	‘ If you please , ’
205519	205540	205542	205543	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ Why do n’t you ask your uncle , my dear Nicholas , what he can possibly mean by it ? ’
205545	205550	205552	205552	Nicholas	207	‘ My dear mother , ’
205554	205622	205552	205552	Nicholas	207	‘ the time for talking has gone by . There is but one step to take , and that is to cast him off with the scorn and indignation he deserves . Your own honour and good name demand that , after the discovery of his vile proceedings , you should not be beholden to him one hour , even for the shelter of these bare walls . ’
205623	205628	205630	205631	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ To be sure , ’
205636	205701	205630	205631	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ he is a brute , a monster ; and the walls are very bare , and want painting too , and I have had this ceiling whitewashed at the expense of eighteen - pence , which is a very distressing thing , considering that it is so much gone into your uncle ’s pocket . I never could have believed it -- never . ’
205702	205710	205712	205712	Nicholas	207	‘ Nor I , nor anybody else , ’
205714	205720	205722	205723	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ Lord bless my life ! ’
205725	205898	205722	205723	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ To think that that Sir Mulberry Hawk should be such an abandoned wretch as Miss La Creevy says he is , Nicholas , my dear ; when I was congratulating myself every day on his being an admirer of our dear Kate ’s , and thinking what a thing it would be for the family if he was to become connected with us , and use his interest to get you some profitable government place . There are very good places to be got about the court , I know ; for a friend of ours ( Miss Cropley , at Exeter , my dear Kate , you recollect ) , he had one , and I know that it was the chief part of his duty to wear silk stockings , and a bag wig like a black watch - pocket ; and to think that it should come to this after all -- oh , dear , dear , it ’s enough to kill one , that it is ! ’
205970	205980	205982	205983	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ Oh I dare say , Miss La Creevy , ’
205995	206023	206025	206026	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ it ’s very easy to say cheer up , but if you had as many occasions to cheer up as I have had -- and there , ’
206031	206077	206025	206026	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ Think of Mr. Pyke and Mr Pluck , two of the most perfect gentlemen that ever lived , what am I too say to them -- what can I say to them ? Why , if I was to say to them , “ I ’m
206095	206096	206089	206089	they	4737	’ ‘
206109	206115	206105	206105	I	0	’ said Nicholas , advancing . ‘

206159	206165	206118	206118	mother	933	’ added Miss La Creevy . ‘
206175	206376	206169	206169	me	0	’ But Mrs. Nickleby was not to be so easily moved , for first she insisted on going upstairs to see that nothing had been left , and then on going downstairs to see that everything had been taken away ; and when she was getting into the coach she had a vision of a forgotten coffee - pot on the back - kitchen hob , and after she was shut in , a dismal recollection of a green umbrella behind some unknown door . At last Nicholas , in a condition of absolute despair , ordered the coachman to drive away , and in the unexpected jerk of a sudden starting , Mrs. Nickleby lost a shilling among the straw , which fortunately confined her attention to the coach until it was too late to remember anything else . Having seen everything safely out , discharged the servant , and locked the door , Nicholas jumped into a cabriolet and drove to a bye place near Golden Square where he had appointed to meet Noggs ; and so quickly had everything been done , that it was barely half - past nine when he reached the place of meeting . ‘
206384	206388	206169	206169	me	0	’ said Nicholas , ‘
206431	206437	206423	206423	you	4742	’ Newman shook his head . ‘
206448	206452	206438	206438	I	0	’ said Nicholas . ‘
206460	206464	206453	206453	You	0	’ returned Newman . ‘
206471	206514	206528	206528	he	4742	’ Nicholas waved his hand carelessly , and concealing the indisposition he really felt , now that the excitement which had sustained him was over , took a hurried farewell of Newman Noggs , and left him . Newman was not three minutes ’
206663	206670	206649	206649	his	4742	‘ Has the post come in ? ’
206671	206674	206649	206649	his	4742	‘ No . ’
206675	206680	206649	206649	his	4742	‘ Any other letters ? ’
206681	206684	206685	206685	Newman	211	‘ One . ’
206697	206702	206704	206704	Ralph	208	‘ What ’s this ? ’
206711	206729	206704	206704	Ralph	208	‘ Left with the letter;--a boy brought them -- quarter of an hour ago , or less . ’
206744	206784	206730	206730	Ralph	208	‘ You are known to me now . There are no reproaches I could heap upon your head which would carry with them one thousandth part of the grovelling shame that this assurance will awaken even in your breast . ‘
206831	206868	206808	206809	Your kindred	4751	‘ You are an old man , and I leave you to the grave . May every recollection of your life cling to your false heart , and cast their darkness on your death - bed . ’
207011	207077	207078	207078	I	0	‘ What a demnition long time you have kept me ringing at this confounded old cracked tea - kettle of a bell , every tinkle of which is enough to throw a strong man into blue convulsions , upon my life and soul , oh demmit,’--said Mr. Mantalini to Newman Noggs , scraping his boots , as he spoke , on Ralph Nickleby ’s scraper . ‘
207088	207092	207078	207078	I	0	’ replied Newman . ‘
207106	207111	207094	207094	you	211	’ said Mr Mantalini , ‘
207119	207177	207094	207094	you	211	’ Mr. Mantalini had got by this time into the passage , and was making his way to the door of Ralph ’s office with very little ceremony , when Newman interposed his body ; and hinting that Mr. Nickleby was unwilling to be disturbed , inquired whether the client ’s business was of a pressing nature . ‘
207184	207189	207383	207383	demmit	1965	’ said Mr. Mantalini . ‘
207212	207348	207435	207435	I	0	’ Newman uttered a significant grunt , and taking Mr. Mantalini ’s proffered card , limped with it into his master ’s office . As he thrust his head in at the door , he saw that Ralph had resumed the thoughtful posture into which he had fallen after perusing his nephew ’s letter , and that he seemed to have been reading it again , as he once more held it open in his hand . The glance was but momentary , for Ralph , being disturbed , turned to demand the cause of the interruption . As Newman stated it , the cause himself swaggered into the room , and grasping Ralph ’s horny hand with uncommon affection , vowed that he had never seen him looking so well in all his life . ‘
207359	207375	207435	207435	I	0	’ said Mr. Mantalini , seating himself unbidden , and arranging his hair and whiskers . ‘

207391	207397	207383	207383	demmit	1965	’ returned Ralph , tartly . ‘

207409	207418	207400	207400	you	4753	’ cried Mr. Mantalini , displaying his teeth . ‘

207454	207460	207449	207449	you	4753	’ demanded Ralph , sternly . ‘
207464	207479	207449	207449	you	4753	’ returned Mr. Mantalini , with a grin , and shaking his head waggishly . ‘
207484	207488	207449	207449	you	4753	’ said Ralph . ‘
207499	207504	207449	207449	you	4753	’ interrupted Mr. Mantalini . ‘

207624	207630	207597	207597	I	0	’ said Ralph , deliberately . ‘
207634	207648	207597	207597	I	0	’ cried Mr. Mantalini , whose face lengthened considerably at this handsome proposal . ‘
207656	207660	207653	207653	you	4753	’ retorted Ralph . ‘

207767	207774	207775	207775	I	0	’ replied Ralph , interrupting him . ‘
207824	207939	207942	207942	you	4753	’ Ralph pushed some papers from him as he spoke , and carelessly rattled his cash - box , as though by mere accident . The sound was too much for Mr Mantalini . He closed the bargain directly it reached his ears , and Ralph told the money out upon the table . He had scarcely done so , and Mr. Mantalini had not yet gathered it all up , when a ring was heard at the bell , and immediately afterwards Newman ushered in no less a person than Madame Mantalini , at sight of whom Mr Mantalini evinced considerable discomposure , and swept the cash into his pocket with remarkable alacrity . ‘
207946	207955	207942	207942	you	4753	’ said Madame Mantalini , tossing her head . ‘
207966	207988	207963	207963	I	0	’ replied her husband , dropping on his knees , and pouncing with kitten - like playfulness upon a stray sovereign . ‘

208020	208029	208014	208014	I	0	’ said Madame Mantalini , with much indignation . ‘

208069	208127	208064	208064	its	4763	’ Whatever were the circumstances which had led to such a result , it certainly appeared as though the popolorum tibby had rather miscalculated , for the nonce , the extent of his lady ’s affection . Madame Mantalini only looked scornful in reply ; and , turning to Ralph , begged him to excuse her intrusion . ‘
208133	208137	208195	208195	I	0	’ said Madame , ‘

208301	208305	208294	208294	she	4767	’ cried Mantalini . ‘
208348	208349	208339	208339	she	4767	’ ‘
208358	208373	208356	208356	sir	714	’ rejoined Madame Mantalini , seating herself , and turning her back upon him . ‘

208391	208396	208339	208339	she	4767	’ exclaimed Mr. Mantalini . ‘
208399	208442	208443	208443	His	714	’ replied his wife . And notwithstanding various blandishments on the part of Mr. Mantalini , Madame Mantalini still said no , and said it too with such determined and resolute ill - temper , that Mr. Mantalini was clearly taken aback . ‘
208449	208493	208446	208447	Mr. Nickleby	208	’ said Madame Mantalini , addressing herself to Ralph , who leant against his easy - chair with his hands behind him , and regarded the amiable couple with a smile of the supremest and most unmitigated contempt,--‘his extravagance is beyond all bounds . ’
208494	208502	208504	208504	Ralph	208	‘ I should scarcely have supposed it , ’
208508	208522	208524	208525	Madame Mantalini	290	‘ I assure you , Mr. Nickleby , however , that it is , ’
208527	208548	208550	208551	Madame Mantalini	290	‘ It makes me miserable ! I am under constant apprehensions , and in constant difficulty . And even this , ’
208557	208580	208550	208551	Madame Mantalini	290	‘ is not the worst . He took some papers of value out of my desk this morning without asking my permission . ’
208592	208597	208599	208600	Madame Mantalini	290	‘ I am obliged , ’
208602	208705	208599	208600	Madame Mantalini	290	‘ since our late misfortunes , to pay Miss Knag a great deal of money for having her name in the business , and I really can not afford to encourage him in all his wastefulness . As I have no doubt that he came straight here , Mr Nickleby , to convert the papers I have spoken of , into money , and as you have assisted us very often before , and are very much connected with us in this kind of matters , I wish you to know the determination at which his conduct has compelled me to arrive . ’
208758	208766	208768	208769	Madame Mantalini	290	‘ I have made up my mind , ’
208782	208787	208768	208769	Madame Mantalini	290	‘ to allowance him . ’
208788	208796	208798	208799	Mr. Mantalini	289	‘ To do that , my joy ? ’
208811	208816	208818	208819	Madame Mantalini	290	‘ To put him , ’
208849	208889	208890	208891	Mr. Mantalini	289	‘ to put him upon a fixed allowance ; and I say that if he has a hundred and twenty pounds a year for his clothes and pocket - money , he may consider himself a very fortunate man . ’
208942	208945	208947	208948	Mr. Mantalini	289	‘ Demnition ! ’
208975	208993	208995	208995	himself	289	‘ But no . It is a demd horrid dream . It is not reality . No ! ’
209017	209023	209025	209025	Ralph	208	‘ A very judicious arrangement , ’
209030	209047	209025	209025	Ralph	208	‘ if your husband will keep within it , ma’am -- as no doubt he will . ’
209048	209051	209053	209054	Mr. Mantalini	289	‘ Demmit ! ’
209067	209138	209063	209063	Ralph	208	‘ it is a horrid reality . She is sitting there before me . There is the graceful outline of her form ; it can not be mistaken -- there is nothing like it . The two countesses had no outlines at all , and the dowager ’s was a demd outline . Why is she so excruciatingly beautiful that I can not be angry with her , even now ? ’
209139	209149	209151	209152	Madame Mantalini	290	‘ You have brought it upon yourself , Alfred , ’
209163	209170	209172	209173	Mr. Mantalini	289	‘ I am a demd villain ! ’
209181	209261	209176	209176	himself	289	‘ I will fill my pockets with change for a sovereign in halfpence and drown myself in the Thames ; but I will not be angry with her , even then , for I will put a note in the twopenny - post as I go along , to tell her where the body is . She will be a lovely widow . I shall be a body . Some handsome women will cry ; she will laugh demnebly . ’
209262	209271	209273	209274	Madame Mantalini	290	‘ Alfred , you cruel , cruel creature , ’
209282	209308	209310	209311	Mr. Mantalini	289	‘ She calls me cruel -- me -- me -- who for her sake will become a demd , damp , moist , unpleasant body ! ’
209313	209332	209334	209335	Madame Mantalini	290	‘ You know it almost breaks my heart , even to hear you talk of such a thing , ’
209337	209345	209334	209335	Madame Mantalini	290	‘ Can I live to be mistrusted ? ’
209350	209400	209334	209335	Madame Mantalini	290	‘ Have I cut my heart into a demd extraordinary number of little pieces , and given them all away , one after another , to the same little engrossing demnition captivater , and can I live to be suspected by her ? Demmit , no I ca n’t . ’
209401	209417	209419	209420	Madame Mantalini	290	‘ Ask Mr. Nickleby whether the sum I have mentioned is not a proper one , ’
209422	209430	209419	209420	Madame Mantalini	290	‘ I do n’t want any sum , ’
209436	209450	209419	209420	Madame Mantalini	290	‘ I shall require no demd allowance . I will be a body . ’
209694	209702	209704	209704	Ralph	208	‘ But it will come soon enough , ’
209706	209792	209704	209704	Ralph	208	‘ all love -- bah ! that I should use the ca nt of boys and girls -- is fleeting enough ; though that which has its sole root in the admiration of a whiskered face like that of yonder baboon , perhaps lasts the longest , as it originates in the greater blindness and is fed by vanity . Meantime the fools bring grist to my mill , so let them live out their day , and the longer it is , the better . ’
209822	209838	209840	209841	Madame Mantalini	290	‘ If you have nothing more to say , my dear , to Mr. Nickleby , ’
209843	209862	209840	209841	Madame Mantalini	290	‘ we will take our leaves . I am sure we have detained him much too long already . ’

209917	209948	209906	209906	he	289	‘ Here ’s an affair about your friend Sir Mulberry . Such a demd extraordinary out - of - the - way kind of thing as never was -- eh ? ’
209949	209955	209957	209957	Ralph	208	‘ What do you mean ? ’
209959	209967	209969	209970	Mr. Mantalini	289	‘ Do n’t you know , demmit ? ’
209972	210001	210003	210003	Ralph	208	‘ I see by the paper that he was thrown from his cabriolet last night , and severely injured , and that his life is in some danger , ’
210008	210033	210003	210003	Ralph	208	‘ but I see nothing extraordinary in that -- accidents are not miraculous events , when men live hard , and drive after dinner . ’
210034	210037	210039	210040	Mr. Mantalini	289	‘ Whew ! ’
210047	210057	210039	210040	Mr. Mantalini	289	‘ Then do n’t you know how it was ? ’
210058	210069	210071	210071	Ralph	208	‘ Not unless it was as I have just supposed , ’
210095	210102	210104	210104	Mantalini	289	‘ Demmit , you amaze me , ’
210201	210207	210209	210210	Mr. Mantalini	289	‘ Do n’t you know , ’
210218	210243	210209	210210	Mr. Mantalini	289	‘ that it was n’t an accident at all , but a demd , furious , manslaughtering attack made upon him by your nephew ? ’
210244	210247	210249	210249	Ralph	208	‘ What ! ’
210260	210266	210249	210249	Ralph	208	‘ Demmit , Nickleby , you ’re
210275	210284	210209	210210	Mr. Mantalini	289	’ said Mantalini , alarmed at these demonstrations . ‘
210288	210292	210296	210296	you	289	’ cried Ralph . ‘
210310	210314	210316	210316	you	289	’ growled Ralph . ‘

210418	210446	210448	210448	Pyke	359	’ said Mr Mantalini , picking up his cane . Ralph affected to smile , and once more inquired from whom Mr. Mantalini had derived his information . ‘
210463	210467	210468	210468	Demnition	473	’ replied Mantalini . ‘

210485	210493	210483	210483	he	4785	’ asked Ralph , knitting his brows . ‘

210583	210590	210592	210592	he	4785	’ interposed Ralph with gleaming eyes . ‘
210598	210604	210595	210595	he	4785	’ Mantalini shook his head . ‘
210607	210614	210595	210595	he	4785	’ said Ralph , turning away . ‘
210623	210631	210632	210632	He	4785	’ he added , looking round again . ‘
210694	210695	210685	210685	You	4791	’ ‘
210698	210707	210685	210685	You	4791	’ rejoined Mantalini , shaking his head again . ‘
210741	210754	210727	210727	he	4785	’ said Mr. Mantalini , rather at a loss for a simile . ‘
210758	210766	210727	210727	he	4785	’ said Ralph , hesitating a little , ‘
210774	210775	210727	210727	he	4785	’ ‘
210784	210794	210776	210776	You	4791	’ replied Mr. Mantalini , in an admiring tone , ‘

210831	210836	210829	210829	Alfred	229	’ interposed Madame Mantalini . ‘
210842	210848	210851	210851	she	4794	’ rejoined Mr. Mantalini soothingly , ‘
210931	210974	210913	210913	they	4800	’ With which remarks , and many more , no less intellectual and to the purpose , Mr. Mantalini kissed the fingers of his gloves to Ralph Nickleby , and drawing his lady ’s arm through his , led her mincingly away . ‘
210979	210988	210913	210913	they	4800	’ muttered Ralph , dropping into his chair ; ‘

211049	211059	211028	211028	I	0	’ asked Newman , suddenly popping in his head . ‘
211062	211081	211028	211028	I	0	’ replied Ralph , with equal abruptness . Newman withdrew his head , but thrust it in again . ‘
211083	211087	211028	211028	I	0	’re quite sure you ’re
211095	211099	211093	211093	you	0	’ said Newman . ‘
211106	211112	211113	211113	He	4806	’ cried Ralph , testily . ‘
211136	211144	211129	211129	your	0	’ said Newman , rubbing his hands . ‘
211148	211270	211129	211129	your	0	’ demanded Ralph , wrought by the intelligence he had just heard , and his clerk ’s provoking coolness , to an intense pitch of irritation . The necessity of a reply was superseded by the unlooked - for entrance of a third party -- the individual in question -- who , bringing his one eye ( for he had but one ) to bear on Ralph Nickleby , made a great many shambling bows , and sat himself down in an armchair , with his hands on his knees , and his short black trousers drawn up so high in the legs by the exertion of seating himself , that they scarcely reached below the tops of his Wellington boots . ‘
211278	211298	211299	211299	I	0	’ said Ralph , bending his gaze upon the visitor , and half smiling as he scrutinised him attentively ; ‘
211308	211309	211305	211306	Mr. Squeers	203	’ ‘
211312	211317	211305	211306	Mr. Squeers	203	’ replied that worthy , ‘
211373	211382	211385	211385	he	4809	’ said Squeers , addressing himself to Newman . ‘
211450	211483	211493	211493	you	0	’ cried Squeers , turning the boy about , and indenting the plumpest parts of his figure with divers pokes and punches , to the great discomposure of his son and heir . ‘
211511	211566	211493	211493	you	0	’ In however good condition Master Squeers might have been , he certainly did not present this remarkable compactness of person , for on his father ’s closing his finger and thumb in illustration of his remark , he uttered a sharp cry , and rubbed the place in the most natural manner possible . ‘
211569	211577	211578	211578	I	0	’ remarked Squeers , a little disconcerted , ‘
211629	211651	211624	211624	them	4818	’ said Squeers , with a triumphant air , as Master Wackford wiped his eyes with the cuff of his jacket , ‘
211656	211657	211658	211658	He	4809	’ ‘
211664	211684	211658	211658	He	4809	’ returned Ralph , who , for some purposes of his own , seemed desirous to conciliate the schoolmaster . ‘
211696	211697	211698	211699	Mrs. Squeers	231	’ ‘
211703	211710	211713	211713	she	231	’ replied the proprietor of Dotheboys , ‘
211787	211804	211774	211774	she	231	’ said Squeers , heaving a sigh , and nodding his head a great many times , ‘
211814	211871	211810	211811	that woman	1651	’ Mr. Squeers indulged in a retrospective look , for some quarter of a minute , as if this allusion to his lady ’s excellences had naturally led his mind to the peaceful village of Dotheboys near Greta Bridge in Yorkshire ; and then looked at Ralph , as if waiting for him to say something . ‘
211881	211885	211873	211873	you	4828	’ asked Ralph . ‘
211900	211904	211894	211894	I	0	’ replied Squeers . ‘
211913	211933	211873	211873	you	4828	’ said Squeers , touching first the roots of his hair , and then the toes of his boots , ‘
212024	212034	212020	212020	I	0	’ asked Mr. Squeers , appealing to his son . ‘
212037	212041	212020	212020	I	0	’ replied Wackford . ‘

212097	212110	212020	212020	I	0	’ said Squeers , catching him a smart box on the ear . ‘
212126	212187	212125	212125	you	4834	’re asked a question . Hold your noise , sir , in a gentleman ’s office , or I ’ll run away from my family and never come back any more ; and then what would become of all them precious and forlorn lads as would be let loose on the world , without their best friend at their elbers ? ’
212188	212197	212199	212199	Ralph	208	‘ Were you obliged to have medical attendance ? ’
212201	212207	212209	212209	Squeers	231	‘ Ay , was I , ’
212211	212229	212230	212230	Ralph	208	‘ and a precious bill the medical attendant brought in too ; but I paid it though . ’
212257	212267	212269	212269	Squeers	231	‘ Yes , I paid it , every farthing , ’
212302	212316	212269	212269	Squeers	231	‘ I was n’t out of pocket by it after all , either . ’
212317	212320	212322	212322	Ralph	208	‘ No ! ’
212324	212329	212331	212331	Squeers	231	‘ Not a halfpenny , ’
212333	212361	212331	212331	Squeers	231	‘ The fact is , we have only one extra with our boys , and that is for doctors when required -- and not then , unless we ’re

212623	212629	212631	212631	Squeers	231	‘ Some bothering law business , ’
212637	212677	212631	212631	Squeers	231	‘ connected with an action , for what they call neglect of a boy . I do n’t know what they would have . He had as good grazing , that boy had , as there is about us . ’
212690	212693	212695	212695	Squeers	231	‘ Grazing , ’
212717	212833	212835	212835	Squeers	231	‘ When a boy gets weak and ill and do n’t relish his meals , we give him a change of diet -- turn him out , for an hour or so every day , into a neighbour ’s turnip field , or sometimes , if it ’s a delicate case , a turnip field and a piece of carrots alternately , and let him eat as many as he likes . There an’t better land in the country than this perwerse lad grazed on , and yet he goes and catches cold and indigestion and what not , and then his friends brings a lawsuit against ME ! Now , you ’d hardly suppose , ’
212851	212868	212835	212835	Squeers	231	‘ that people ’s ingratitude would carry them quite as far as that ; would you ? ’
212869	212876	212878	212878	Ralph	208	‘ A hard case , indeed , ’
212880	212894	212896	212896	Squeers	231	‘ You do n’t say more than the truth when you say that , ’
212898	212950	212896	212896	Squeers	231	‘ I do n’t suppose there ’s a man going , as possesses the fondness for youth that I do . There ’s youth to the amount of eight hundred pound a year at Dotheboys Hall at this present time . I ’d take sixteen hundred pound worth if I could get ‘

I ’ve brought little Wackford up , on purpose to show to parents and guardians . I shall put him in the advertisement , this time . Look at that boy -- himself a pupil . Why he ’s a miracle of high feeding , that boy is ! ’
213088	213099	213101	213101	Ralph	208	‘ I should like to have a word with you , ’
213121	213131	213133	213133	Squeers	231	‘ As many words as you like , sir , ’
213135	213182	213184	213184	Squeers	231	‘ Wackford , you go and play in the back office , and do n’t move about too much or you ’ll get thin , and that wo n’t do . You have n’t got such a thing as twopence , Mr Nickleby , have you ? ’

213385	213414	213383	213383	Ralph	208	‘ that you are dolt enough to forgive or forget , very readily , the violence that was committed upon you , or the exposure which accompanied it ? ’
213415	213420	213422	213422	Squeers	231	‘ Devil a bit , ’
213426	213444	213446	213446	Ralph	208	‘ Or to lose an opportunity of repaying it with interest , if you could get one ? ’

213505	213529	213503	213503	Squeers	231	‘ I thought that if it was in your power to make me , besides the trifle of money you sent , any compensation-- ’
213530	213533	213535	213535	Ralph	208	‘ Ah ! ’
213540	213547	213535	213535	Ralph	208	‘ You need n’t go on . ’
213568	213579	213561	213561	he	208	‘ Who is this boy that he took with him ? ’
213585	213605	213607	213607	Ralph	208	‘ Was he young or old , healthy or sickly , tractable or rebellious ? Speak out , man , ’
213609	213617	213619	213619	Squeers	231	‘ Why , he was n’t young , ’
213621	213634	213619	213619	Squeers	231	‘ that is , not young for a boy , you know . ’
213635	213650	213652	213652	Ralph	208	‘ That is , he was not a boy at all , I suppose ? ’
213654	213657	213659	213659	Squeers	231	‘ Well , ’
213672	213705	213665	213665	he	4856	‘ he might have been nigh twenty . He would n’t seem so old , though , to them as did n’t know him , for he was a little wanting here , ’
213710	213725	213665	213665	he	4856	‘ nobody at home , you know , if you knocked ever so often . ’
213726	213738	213740	213740	Ralph	208	‘ And you DID knock pretty often , I dare say ? ’
213742	213746	213748	213748	Squeers	231	‘ Pretty well , ’
213753	213771	213773	213773	Ralph	208	‘ When you wrote to acknowledge the receipt of this trifle of money as you call it , ’
213775	213809	213773	213773	Ralph	208	‘ you told me his friends had deserted him long ago , and that you had not the faintest clue or trace to tell you who he was . Is that the truth ? ’
213810	213817	213819	213819	Squeers	231	‘ It is , worse luck ! ’
213842	213903	213833	213833	Ralph	208	‘ It ’s fourteen years ago , by the entry in my book , since a strange man brought him to my place , one autumn night , and left him there ; paying five pound five , for his first quarter in advance . He might have been five or six year old at that time -- not more . ’
213904	213913	213915	213915	Ralph	208	‘ What more do you know about him ? ’
213917	213922	213829	213829	his	4856	‘ Devilish little , I ’m

213990	213995	213996	213996	Charity	477	’ suggested Ralph drily . ‘
214002	214010	213996	213996	Charity	477	’ returned Squeers , rubbing his knees , ‘
214050	214067	214025	214030	this young scoundrel of a Nickleby	4861	’ said Squeers , dropping his voice , and drawing his chair still closer to Ralph , ‘
214200	214201	214202	214202	We	4862	’ ‘
214212	214227	214202	214202	We	4862	’ said Ralph , laying his hand on the arm of the Yorkshire schoolmaster . ‘
214230	214234	214202	214202	We	4862	’ echoed Squeers . ‘
214290	214291	214280	214280	she	231	’ ‘
214299	214303	214292	214292	We	4862	’ said Ralph . ‘
214331	214332	214324	214324	I	0	’ ‘
214341	214345	214336	214336	you	0	’ interrupted Squeers , ‘
214388	214450	214386	214386	you	0	’ Bawling these requests to Newman Noggs , Mr. Squeers betook himself to the little back - office , and fitted on his child ’s hat with parental anxiety , while Newman , with his pen behind his ear , sat , stiff and immovable , on his stool , regarding the father and son by turns with a broad stare . ‘
214460	214490	214458	214458	he	9437	’ said Squeers , throwing his head a little on one side , and falling back to the desk , the better to estimate the proportions of little Wackford . ‘
214493	214497	214504	214504	he	9437	’ said Newman . ‘
214506	214510	214504	214504	he	9437	’ pursued Squeers . ‘
214522	214523	214519	214519	he	9437	’ ‘
214526	214539	214540	214540	he	9437	’ replied Newman , suddenly thrusting his face into that of Squeers , ‘
214564	214585	214590	214591	the man	8927	’ Having uttered these fragmentary observations , Newman dropped upon his desk and began to write with most marvellous rapidity . ‘
214594	214600	214590	214591	the man	8927	’ cried Squeers , colouring . ‘
214605	214611	214613	214613	he	9437	’ Newman made no reply . ‘
214616	214921	214613	214613	he	9437	’ said Squeers . But , still Newman betrayed no consciousness of any presence save his own ; so , Mr. Squeers comforted himself by saying that he was both drunk AND mad ; and , with this parting observation , he led his hopeful son away . In exact proportion as Ralph Nickleby became conscious of a struggling and lingering regard for Kate , had his detestation of Nicholas augmented . It might be , that to atone for the weakness of inclining to any one person , he held it necessary to hate some other more intensely than before ; but such had been the course of his feelings . And now , to be defied and spurned , to be held up to her in the worst and most repulsive colours , to know that she was taught to hate and despise him : to feel that there was infection in his touch , and taint in his companionship -- to know all this , and to know that the mover of it all was that same boyish poor relation who had twitted him in their very first interview , and openly bearded and braved him since , wrought his quiet and stealthy malignity to such a pitch , that there was scarcely anything he would not have hazarded to gratify it , if he could have seen his way to some immediate retaliation . But , fortunately for Nicholas , Ralph Nickleby did not ; and although he cast about all that day , and kept a corner of his brain working on the one anxious subject through all the round of schemes and business that came with it , night found him at last , still harping on the same theme , and still pursuing the same unprofitable reflections . ‘
214930	214934	214928	214928	he	8657	’ said Ralph , ‘
215003	215031	214997	214997	I	0	’ He had been occupied in tearing Nicholas ’s letter into atoms ; and as he spoke , he scattered it in a tiny shower about him . ‘
215036	215045	215058	215058	crowds	4880	’ pursued Ralph , with a bitter smile , ‘
215089	215214	215079	215079	I	0	’ And being , by this time , in a pleasant frame of mind for slumber , Ralph Nickleby went to bed . CHAPTER 35 Smike becomes known to Mrs. Nickleby and Kate . Nicholas also meets with new Acquaintances . Brighter Days seem to dawn upon the Family Having established his mother and sister in the apartments of the kind - hearted miniature painter , and ascertained that Sir Mulberry Hawk was in no danger of losing his life , Nicholas turned his thoughts to poor Smike , who , after breakfasting with Newman Noggs , had remained , in a disconsolate state , at that worthy creature ’s lodgings , waiting , with much anxiety , for further intelligence of his protector . ‘
215239	215243	215244	215244	I	0	’ thought Nicholas , ‘
215295	215298	215299	215299	they	4887	’ Nicholas said ‘
215300	215343	215369	215369	she	4888	’ , but his misgivings were confined to one person . He was sure of Kate , but he knew his mother ’s peculiarities , and was not quite so certain that Smike would find favour in the eyes of Mrs Nickleby . ‘
215346	215357	215369	215369	she	4888	’ thought Nicholas as he departed on his benevolent errand ; ‘

215401	215412	215369	215369	she	4888	’ said Smike , overjoyed to see his friend again , ‘

215443	215448	215432	215432	I	0	’ replied Nicholas gaily . ‘

215532	215533	215534	215534	I	0	’ ‘
215540	215544	215534	215534	I	0	’ said Smike ; ‘

215597	215598	215594	215595	old friend	4894	’ ‘
215613	215621	215594	215595	old friend	4894	’ replied Smike , pressing his hand ; ‘
215698	215699	215687	215687	I	0	’ ‘
215719	215723	215702	215702	you	4890	’ said Nicholas . ‘
215746	215750	215736	215736	they	4900	’ replied Smike . ‘
215778	215779	215774	215774	I	0	’ ‘
215788	215793	215780	215780	You	4890	’ said Nicholas cheerfully . ‘
215815	215842	215843	215843	Smike	264	’ company!--my pretty sister too , whom you have so often asked me about . Is this your Yorkshire gallantry ? For shame ! for shame ! ’
215849	215856	215858	215858	Nicholas	207	‘ When I talk of home , ’
215860	215987	215858	215858	Nicholas	207	‘ I talk of mine -- which is yours of course . If it were defined by any particular four walls and a roof , God knows I should be sufficiently puzzled to say whereabouts it lay ; but that is not what I mean . When I speak of home , I speak of the place where -- in default of a better -- those I love are gathered together ; and if that place were a gypsy ’s tent , or a barn , I should call it by the same good name notwithstanding . And now , for what is my present home , which , however alarming your expectations may be , will neither terrify you by its extent nor its magnificence ! ’
216035	216041	216043	216043	Nicholas	207	‘ And this , Kate , ’
216054	216071	216043	216043	Nicholas	207	‘ is the faithful friend and affectionate fellow - traveller whom I prepared you to receive . ’
216490	216509	216511	216511	Nicholas	207	‘ You are always kind - hearted , and anxious to help the oppressed , my dear mother , ’
216513	216526	216511	216511	Nicholas	207	‘ so you will be favourably disposed towards him , I know . ’
216527	216536	216538	216539	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ I am sure , my dear Nicholas , ’
216565	216641	216643	216644	Mrs Nickleby	207	‘ I am sure any friend of yours has , as indeed he naturally ought to have , and must have , of course , you know , a great claim upon me , and of course , it is a very great pleasure to me to be introduced to anybody you take an interest in . There can be no doubt about that ; none at all ; not the least in the world , ’
216646	216732	216643	216644	Mrs Nickleby	207	‘ At the same time I must say , Nicholas , my dear , as I used to say to your poor dear papa , when he WOULD bring gentlemen home to dinner , and there was nothing in the house , that if he had come the day before yesterday -- no , I do n’t mean the day before yesterday now ; I should have said , perhaps , the year before last -- we should have been better able to entertain him . ’
216762	216774	216776	216777	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ Because , if he is , Kate , my dear , ’
216779	216800	216776	216777	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ I do n’t see that it ’s possible for him to sleep anywhere , and that ’s the truth . ’
216825	216833	216835	216836	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ La , Kate , my dear , ’
216841	216889	216891	216892	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ how you do tickle one ! Of course , I understand THAT , my love , without your telling me ; and I said the same to Nicholas , and I AM very much pleased . You did n’t tell me , Nicholas , my dear , ’
216908	216916	216891	216892	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ what your friend ’s name is . ’
216917	216923	216925	216925	Nicholas	207	‘ His name , mother , ’
216927	216931	216925	216925	Nicholas	207	‘ is Smike . ’
216967	216973	216975	216975	Nicholas	207	‘ What is the matter ? ’
216982	216989	216991	216992	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ It ’s so like Pyke , ’
216994	217014	216991	216992	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ so exactly like Pyke . Oh ! do n’t speak to me -- I shall be better presently . ’
217069	217078	217080	217081	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ It ’s a weakness in our family , ’
217083	217190	217192	217193	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ so , of course , I ca n’t be blamed for it . Your grandmama , Kate , was exactly the same -- precisely . The least excitement , the slightest surprise -- she fainted away directly . I have heard her say , often and often , that when she was a young lady , and before she was married , she was turning a corner into Oxford Street one day , when she ran against her own hairdresser , who , it seems , was escaping from a bear;--the mere suddenness of the encounter made her faint away directly . Wait , though , ’
217199	217205	217192	217193	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ Let me be sure I ’m
217275	217325	217326	217327	Mr. Smike	264	’ Mrs. Nickleby having fallen imperceptibly into one of her retrospective moods , improved in temper from that moment , and glided , by an easy change of the conversation occasionally , into various other anecdotes , no less remarkable for their strict application to the subject in hand . ‘
217337	217355	217332	217332	Nicholas	207	’ said Mrs. Nickleby , after dinner , and when she had been silent for some time . ‘
217360	217364	217358	217358	mother	933	’ replied Nicholas . ‘
217375	217376	217367	217367	you	933	’ ‘
217381	217386	217367	217367	you	933	’ cried Mrs. Nickleby . ‘
217421	217432	217433	217436	A very proud man	4941	’ said the good lady , addressing herself to him . ‘
217460	217461	217462	217462	My	0	’ ‘
217466	217470	217462	217462	My	0	’ reasoned Nicholas , ‘
217499	217500	217472	217472	you	12536	’ ‘
217518	217523	217506	217506	I	0	’ said Mrs. Nickleby . ‘
217579	217906	217567	217567	you	702	’ Having put down Nicholas in this triumphant manner , Mrs. Nickleby was suddenly seized with a forgetfulness of Smike ’s real name , and an irresistible tendency to call him Mr. Slammons ; which circumstance she attributed to the remarkable similarity of the two names in point of sound both beginning with an S , and moreover being spelt with an M. But whatever doubt there might be on this point , there was none as to his being a most excellent listener ; which circumstance had considerable influence in placing them on the very best terms , and inducing Mrs Nickleby to express the highest opinion of his general deportment and disposition . Thus , the little circle remained , on the most amicable and agreeable footing , until the Monday morning , when Nicholas withdrew himself from it for a short time , seriously to reflect upon the state of his affairs , and to determine , if he could , upon some course of life , which would enable him to support those who were so entirely dependent upon his exertions . Mr. Crummles occurred to him more than once ; but although Kate was acquainted with the whole history of his connection with that gentleman , his mother was not ; and he foresaw a thousand fretful objections , on her part , to his seeking a livelihood upon the stage . There were graver reasons , too , against his returning to that mode of life . Independently of those arising out of its spare and precarious earnings , and his own internal conviction that he could never hope to aspire to any great distinction , even as a provincial actor , how could he carry his sister from town to town , and place to place , and debar her from any other associates than those with whom he would be compelled , almost without distinction , to mingle ? ‘
217912	217920	217567	217567	you	702	’ said Nicholas , shaking his head ; ‘
217927	218004	217921	217921	I	0	’ It was much easier to make this resolution than to carry it into effect . With no greater experience of the world than he had acquired for himself in his short trials ; with a sufficient share of headlong rashness and precipitation ( qualities not altogether unnatural at his time of life ) ; with a very slender stock of money , and a still more scanty stock of friends ; what could he do ? ‘
218007	218011	217921	217921	I	0	’ said Nicholas , ‘
218020	218894	218012	218012	I	0	’ He smiled at himself as he walked away with a quick step ; for , an instant before , he had been internally blaming his own precipitation . He did not laugh himself out of the intention , however , for on he went : picturing to himself , as he approached the place , all kinds of splendid possibilities , and impossibilities too , for that matter , and thinking himself , perhaps with good reason , very fortunate to be endowed with so buoyant and sanguine a temperament . The office looked just the same as when he had left it last , and , indeed , with one or two exceptions , there seemed to be the very same placards in the window that he had seen before . There were the same unimpeachable masters and mistresses in want of virtuous servants , and the same virtuous servants in want of unimpeachable masters and mistresses , and the same magnificent estates for the investment of capital , and the same enormous quantities of capital to be invested in estates , and , in short , the same opportunities of all sorts for people who wanted to make their fortunes . And a most extraordinary proof it was of the national prosperity , that people had not been found to avail themselves of such advantages long ago . As Nicholas stopped to look in at the window , an old gentleman happened to stop too ; and Nicholas , carrying his eye along the window - panes from left to right in search of some capital - text placard which should be applicable to his own case , caught sight of this old gentleman ’s figure , and instinctively withdrew his eyes from the window , to observe the same more closely . He was a sturdy old fellow in a broad - skirted blue coat , made pretty large , to fit easily , and with no particular waist ; his bulky legs clothed in drab breeches and high gaiters , and his head protected by a low - crowned broad - brimmed white hat , such as a wealthy grazier might wear . He wore his coat buttoned ; and his dimpled double chin rested in the folds of a white neckerchief -- not one of your stiff - starched apoplectic cravats , but a good , easy , old - fashioned white neckcloth that a man might go to bed in and be none the worse for . But what principally attracted the attention of Nicholas was the old gentleman ’s eye,--never was such a clear , twinkling , honest , merry , happy eye , as that . And there he stood , looking a little upward , with one hand thrust into the breast of his coat , and the other playing with his old - fashioned gold watch - chain : his head thrown a little on one side , and his hat a little more on one side than his head , ( but that was evidently accident ; not his ordinary way of wearing it , ) with such a pleasant smile playing about his mouth , and such a comical expression of mingled slyness , simplicity , kind - heartedness , and good - humour , lighting up his jolly old face , that Nicholas would have been content to have stood there and looked at him until evening , and to have forgotten , meanwhile , that there was such a thing as a soured mind or a crabbed countenance to be met with in the whole wide world . But , even a very remote approach to this gratification was not to be made , for although he seemed quite unconscious of having been the subject of observation , he looked casually at Nicholas ; and the latter , fearful of giving offence , resumed his scrutiny of the window instantly . Still , the old gentleman stood there , glancing from placard to placard , and Nicholas could not forbear raising his eyes to his face again . Grafted upon the quaintness and oddity of his appearance , was something so indescribably engaging , and bespeaking so much worth , and there were so many little lights hovering about the corners of his mouth and eyes , that it was not a mere amusement , but a positive pleasure and delight to look at him . This being the case , it is no wonder that the old man caught Nicholas in the fact , more than once . At such times , Nicholas coloured and looked embarrassed : for the truth is , that he had begun to wonder whether the stranger could , by any possibility , be looking for a clerk or secretary ; and thinking this , he felt as if the old gentleman must know it . Long as all this takes to tell , it was not more than a couple of minutes in passing . As the stranger was moving away , Nicholas caught his eye again , and , in the awkwardness of the moment , stammered out an apology . ‘
218902	218951	219002	219003	Poor fellows	4955	’ said the old man . This was said in such a hearty tone , and the voice was so exactly what it should have been from such a speaker , and there was such a cordiality in the manner , that Nicholas was emboldened to speak again . ‘
218960	218973	218958	218958	sir	714	’ he said , half smiling as he motioned towards the window . ‘
218995	219001	218991	218991	I	0	’ replied the old man . ‘
219008	219091	218991	218991	I	0	’ He moved away as he said this ; but seeing that Nicholas was about to speak , good - naturedly slackened his pace , as if he were unwilling to cut him short . After a little of that hesitation which may be sometimes observed between two people in the street who have exchanged a nod , and are both uncertain whether they shall turn back and speak , or not , Nicholas found himself at the old man ’s side . ‘
219108	219109	219103	219103	you	714	’ ‘
219132	219136	219123	219123	you	714	’ said Nicholas . ‘
219148	219159	219161	219161	you	0	’ returned the old man , looking slyly at Nicholas . ‘
219177	219183	219172	219172	you	0	’ Nicholas shook his head . ‘
219188	219206	219172	219172	you	0	’ laughed the old gentleman , rubbing his hands and wrists as if he were washing them . ‘
219240	219241	219224	219224	I	0	’ ‘
219264	219268	219254	219254	you	714	’ rejoined Nicholas . ‘
219271	219284	219254	219254	you	714	’ cried the old man , surveying him from head to foot . ‘
219311	219327	219353	219353	d’ye	4960	’ Nicholas bowed , and bidding him good - morning , turned upon his heel . ‘
219330	219351	219353	219353	d’ye	4960	’ said the old man , beckoning him into a bye street , where they could converse with less interruption . ‘
219358	219359	219353	219353	d’ye	4960	’ ‘
219403	219407	219395	219395	I	0	’ returned Nicholas . ‘
219425	219434	219395	219395	I	0	’ said the old man with much animation . ‘
219457	219472	219455	219455	God	225	’ and he raised his hat from his head , and looked very grave . ‘
219489	219511	219512	219512	You’re	0	’ said the old man , laying his hand on the shoulder of Nicholas , and walking him up the street . ‘
219516	219528	219512	219512	You’re	0	’ laying his finger on the sleeve of his black coat . ‘
219536	219537	219538	219539	My father	8479	’ ‘
219541	219545	219538	219539	My father	8479	’ replied Nicholas . ‘
219548	219555	219538	219539	My father	8479	’ said the old gentleman quickly . ‘
219572	219576	219567	219568	Widowed mother	4966	’ Nicholas sighed . ‘
219584	219585	219582	219582	Eh	4969	’ ‘
219589	219593	219586	219587	One sister	4970	’ rejoined Nicholas . ‘
219610	219626	219606	219606	I	0	’ said the old man , looking wistfully into the face of the young one . ‘
219634	219638	219627	219627	I	0	’ said Nicholas . ‘
219642	219648	219627	219627	I	0	’ said the old gentleman , ‘
219704	219821	220054	220054	Cheeryble	204	’ There was something so earnest and guileless in the way in which all this was said , and such a complete disregard of all conventional restraints and coldnesses , that Nicholas could not resist it . Among men who have any sound and sterling qualities , there is nothing so contagious as pure openness of heart . Nicholas took the infection instantly , and ran over the main points of his little history without reserve : merely suppressing names , and touching as lightly as possible upon his uncle ’s treatment of Kate . The old man listened with great attention , and when he had concluded , drew his arm eagerly through his own . ‘
219831	219835	220054	220054	Cheeryble	204	’ said he . ‘
219848	219906	219841	219841	We	4973	’ So saying , the old gentleman dragged him back into Oxford Street , and hailing an omnibus on its way to the city , pushed Nicholas in before him , and followed himself . As he appeared in a most extraordinary condition of restless excitement , and whenever Nicholas offered to speak , immediately interposed with : ‘
219925	220053	220054	220054	Cheeryble	204	’ the young man thought it better to attempt no further interruption . Into the city they journeyed accordingly , without interchanging any conversation ; and the farther they went , the more Nicholas wondered what the end of the adventure could possibly be . The old gentleman got out , with great alacrity , when they reached the Bank , and once more taking Nicholas by the arm , hurried him along Threadneedle Street , and through some lanes and passages on the right , until they , at length , emerged in a quiet shady little square . Into the oldest and cleanest - looking house of business in the square , he led the way . The only inscription on the door - post was ‘
220058	220199	220054	220054	Cheeryble	204	’ but from a hasty glance at the directions of some packages which were lying about , Nicholas supposed that the brothers Cheeryble were German merchants . Passing through a warehouse which presented every indication of a thriving business , Mr. Cheeryble ( for such Nicholas supposed him to be , from the respect which had been shown him by the warehousemen and porters whom they passed ) led him into a little partitioned - off counting - house like a large glass case , in which counting - house there sat -- as free from dust and blemish as if he had been fixed into the glass case before the top was put on , and had never come out since -- a fat , elderly , large - faced clerk , with silver spectacles and a powdered head . ‘
220209	220227	220230	220230	he	8657	’ said Mr. Cheeryble , with no less kindness of manner than he had shown to Nicholas . ‘
220235	220256	220230	220230	he	8657	’ replied the fat clerk , turning his spectacle - glasses towards his principal , and his eyes towards Nicholas , ‘
220264	220265	220258	220259	Mr. Trimmers	483	’ ‘
220277	220282	220271	220271	he	8657	’ said Mr. Cheeryble . ‘
220310	220314	220308	220308	sir	714	’ rejoined Tim . ‘
220325	220326	220327	220327	He	8657	’ ‘
220333	220342	220327	220327	He	8657	’ said Mr. Cheeryble , with great earnestness . ‘
220391	220431	220383	220383	I	0	’ Saying which , Mr. Cheeryble rubbed his hands with infinite delight , and Mr. Trimmers happening to pass the door that instant , on his way out , shot out after him and caught him by the hand . ‘
220457	220473	220445	220445	I	0	’ said Mr. Cheeryble , dragging him into a corner to get out of hearing . ‘
220490	220491	220488	220488	Trimmers	483	’ ‘
220497	220502	220494	220495	six children	9015	’ replied the gentleman , ‘
220512	220513	220514	220515	My brother	8657	’ ‘
220524	220532	220534	220536	the old man	897	’re a good fellow too , Trimmers , ’
220547	220658	220534	220536	the old man	897	‘ Put me down for another twenty -- or -- stop a minute , stop a minute . We must n’t look ostentatious ; put me down ten pound , and Tim Linkinwater ten pound . A cheque for twenty pound for Mr. Trimmers , Tim . God bless you , Trimmers -- and come and dine with us some day this week ; you ’ll always find a knife and fork , and we shall be delighted . Now , my dear sir -- cheque from Mr. Linkinwater , Tim . Smashed by a cask of sugar , and six poor children -- oh dear , dear , dear ! ’
220721	220725	220727	220728	Mr. Cheeryble	481	‘ Brother Ned , ’
220740	220762	220727	220728	Mr. Cheeryble	481	‘ are you busy , my dear brother , or can you spare time for a word or two with me ? ’
220763	220771	220732	220732	his	481	‘ Brother Charles , my dear fellow , ’
220803	220817	220792	220792	Nicholas	207	‘ do n’t ask me such a question , but come in directly . ’
220983	220987	220989	220989	Nicholas	207	‘ Brother Ned , ’
220999	221058	220989	220989	Nicholas	207	‘ here is a young friend of mine whom we must assist . We must make proper inquiries into his statements , in justice to him as well as to ourselves , and if they are confirmed -- as I feel assured they will be -- we must assist him , we must assist him , brother Ned . ’
221059	221074	221076	221077	the other	8439	‘ It is enough , my dear brother , that you say we should , ’
221079	221118	220989	220989	Nicholas	207	‘ When you say that , no further inquiries are needed . He SHALL be assisted . What are his necessities , and what does he require ? Where is Tim Linkinwater ? Let us have him here . ’
221204	221210	221212	221213	brother Ned	484	‘ Where is Tim Linkinwater ? ’
221215	221222	221224	221225	brother Charles	355	‘ Stop , stop , stop ! ’
221232	221298	221224	221225	brother Charles	355	‘ I ’ve a plan , my dear brother , I ’ve a plan . Tim is getting old , and Tim has been a faithful servant , brother Ned ; and I do n’t think pensioning Tim ’s mother and sister , and buying a little tomb for the family when his poor brother died , was a sufficient recompense for his faithful services . ’
221299	221306	221308	221309	the other	8439	‘ No , no , no , ’
221311	221322	221308	221309	the other	8439	‘ Certainly not . Not half enough , not half . ’
221323	221332	221334	221336	the old gentleman	8480	‘ If we could lighten Tim ’s duties , ’

Old Tim Linkinwater young again ! Eh , brother Ned , eh ? Why , I recollect old Tim Linkinwater quite a little boy , do n’t you ? Ha , ha , ha ! Poor Tim , poor Tim ! ’
221471	221484	221486	221488	the old man	897	‘ But hear this first -- hear this first , brother Ned , ’
221503	221565	221486	221488	the old man	897	‘ I ’ll tell it you myself , brother Ned , because the young gentleman is modest , and is a scholar , Ned , and I should n’t feel it right that he should tell us his story over and over again as if he was a beggar , or as if we doubted him . No , no no . ’
221566	221573	221575	221576	the other	8439	‘ No , no , no , ’

221654	221849	221850	221850	Tim	482	’ The twins pressed each other ’s hands in silence ; and in his own homely manner , brother Charles related the particulars he had heard from Nicholas . The conversation which ensued was a long one , and when it was over , a secret conference of almost equal duration took place between brother Ned and Tim Linkinwater in another room . It is no disparagement to Nicholas to say , that before he had been closeted with the two brothers ten minutes , he could only wave his hand at every fresh expression of kindness and sympathy , and sob like a little child . At length brother Ned and Tim Linkinwater came back together , when Tim instantly walked up to Nicholas and whispered in his ear in a very brief sentence ( for Tim was ordinarily a man of few words ) , that he had taken down the address in the Strand , and would call upon him that evening , at eight . Having done which , Tim wiped his spectacles and put them on , preparatory to hearing what more the brothers Cheeryble had got to say . ‘
221852	221857	222003	222004	brother Charles	355	’ said brother Charles , ‘
221876	221925	221926	221926	I	0	’ Brother Ned remarked that Tim was aware of that intention , and quite approved of it ; and Tim having nodded , and said he did , drew himself up and looked particularly fat , and very important . After which , there was a profound silence . ‘
221927	221940	221942	221942	Tim	482	’m not coming an hour later in the morning , you know , ’

222028	222043	222003	222004	brother Charles	355	‘ Damn your obstinacy , Tim Linkinwater , what do you mean , sir ? ’
222044	222052	222054	222054	Tim	482	‘ It ’s forty - four year , ’
222077	222236	222238	222238	Tim	482	‘ forty - four year , next May , since I first kept the books of Cheeryble , Brothers . I ’ve opened the safe every morning all that time ( Sundays excepted ) as the clock struck nine , and gone over the house every night at half - past ten ( except on Foreign Post nights , and then twenty minutes before twelve ) to see the doors fastened , and the fires out . I ’ve never slept out of the back - attic one single night . There ’s the same mignonette box in the middle of the window , and the same four flower - pots , two on each side , that I brought with me when I first came . There an’t -- I’ve said it again and again , and I ’ll maintain it -- there an’t such a square as this in the world . I KNOW there an’t , ’

There ’s not such a spring in England as the pump under the archway . There ’s not such a view in England as the view out of my window ; I ’ve seen it every morning before I shaved , and I ought to know something about it . I have slept in that room , ’

222377	222391	222393	222394	the twins	12831	‘ Damn you , Tim Linkinwater , how dare you talk about dying ? ’
222406	222422	222424	222424	Tim	482	‘ That ’s what I ’ve got to say , Mr. Edwin and Mr. Charles , ’
222431	222465	222424	222424	Tim	482	‘ This is n’t the first time you ’ve talked about superannuating me ; but , if you please , we ’ll make it the last , and drop the subject for evermore . ’

222976	223027	223029	223029	I	0	’ most comprehensive liberality , he reported strongly and warmly in favour of Nicholas ; and that , next day , he was appointed to the vacant stool in the counting - house of Cheeryble , Brothers , with a present salary of one hundred and twenty pounds a year . ‘
223036	223043	223029	223029	I	0	’ said Nicholas ’s first friend , ‘

223136	223143	223133	223134	brother Ned	488	’ suggested the other , mildly ; ‘
223270	224100	223264	223264	you	488	’ Brother Ned gave his hand upon it , and not only said it should be done , but had it done too ; and , in one short week , Nicholas took possession of the stool , and Mrs. Nickleby and Kate took possession of the house , and all was hope , bustle , and light - heartedness . There surely never was such a week of discoveries and surprises as the first week of that cottage . Every night when Nicholas came home , something new had been found out . One day it was a grapevine , and another day it was a boiler , and another day it was the key of the front - parlour closet at the bottom of the water - butt , and so on through a hundred items . Then , this room was embellished with a muslin curtain , and that room was rendered quite elegant by a window - blind , and such improvements were made , as no one would have supposed possible . Then there was Miss La Creevy , who had come out in the omnibus to stop a day or two and help , and who was perpetually losing a very small brown - paper parcel of tin tacks and a very large hammer , and running about with her sleeves tucked up at the wrists , and falling off pairs of steps and hurting herself very much -- and Mrs. Nickleby , who talked incessantly , and did something now and then , but not often -- and Kate , who busied herself noiselessly everywhere , and was pleased with everything -- and Smike , who made the garden a perfect wonder to look upon -- and Nicholas , who helped and encouraged them every one -- all the peace and cheerfulness of home restored , with such new zest imparted to every frugal pleasure , and such delight to every hour of meeting , as misfortune and separation alone could give ! In short , the poor Nicklebys were social and happy ; while the rich Nickleby was alone and miserable . CHAPTER 36 Private and confidential ; relating to Family Matters . Showing how Mr Kenwigs underwent violent Agitation , and how Mrs. Kenwigs was as well as could be expected It might have been seven o’clock in the evening , and it was growing dark in the narrow streets near Golden Square , when Mr. Kenwigs sent out for a pair of the cheapest white kid gloves -- those at fourteen - pence -- and selecting the strongest , which happened to be the right - hand one , walked downstairs with an air of pomp and much excitement , and proceeded to muffle the knob of the street - door knocker therein . Having executed this task with great nicety , Mr. Kenwigs pulled the door to , after him , and just stepped across the road to try the effect from the opposite side of the street . Satisfied that nothing could possibly look better in its way , Mr. Kenwigs then stepped back again , and calling through the keyhole to Morleena to open the door , vanished into the house , and was seen no longer . Now , considered as an abstract circumstance , there was no more obvious cause or reason why Mr. Kenwigs should take the trouble of muffling this particular knocker , than there would have been for his muffling the knocker of any nobleman or gentleman resident ten miles off ; because , for the greater convenience of the numerous lodgers , the street - door always stood wide open , and the knocker was never used at all . The first floor , the second floor , and the third floor , had each a bell of its own . As to the attics , no one ever called on them ; if anybody wanted the parlours , they were close at hand , and all he had to do was to walk straight into them ; while the kitchen had a separate entrance down the area steps . As a question of mere necessity and usefulness , therefore , this muffling of the knocker was thoroughly incomprehensible . But knockers may be muffled for other purposes than those of mere utilitarianism , as , in the present instance , was clearly shown . There are certain polite forms and ceremonies which must be observed in civilised life , or mankind relapse into their original barbarism . No genteel lady was ever yet confined -- indeed , no genteel confinement can possibly take place -- without the accompanying symbol of a muffled knocker . Mrs. Kenwigs was a lady of some pretensions to gentility ; Mrs Kenwigs was confined . And , therefore , Mr. Kenwigs tied up the silent knocker on the premises in a white kid glove . ‘
224102	224108	224110	224111	Mr. Kenwigs	312	’m not quite certain neither , ’
224124	224142	224110	224111	Mr. Kenwigs	312	‘ whether , as it ’s a boy , I wo n’t have it in the papers . ’
224213	224223	224225	224226	Mr. Lumbey	491	‘ It ’s a fine boy , Mr. Kenwigs , ’
224231	224244	224225	224226	Mr. Lumbey	491	‘ You consider him a fine boy , do you , sir ? ’
224249	224263	224265	224266	the doctor	1476	‘ It ’s the finest boy I ever saw in all my life , ’
224268	224276	224265	224266	the doctor	1476	‘ I never saw such a baby . ’
224319	224329	224331	224332	Mr. Lumbey	491	‘ I ne -- ver saw such a baby , ’
224337	224344	224346	224347	Mr. Kenwigs	312	‘ Morleena was a fine baby , ’
224364	224371	224373	224374	Mr. Lumbey	491	‘ They were all fine babies , ’
224483	224497	224499	224500	Mr. Kenwigs	312	‘ She will be a treasure to the man she marries , sir , ’
224505	224518	224499	224500	Mr. Kenwigs	312	‘ I think she ’ll marry above her station , Mr. Lumbey . ’
224519	224527	224529	224530	the doctor	1476	‘ I should n’t wonder at all , ’
224532	224544	224546	224547	Mr. Kenwigs	312	‘ You never see her dance , sir , did you ? ’
224555	224558	224565	224565	he	312	‘ Ay ! ’
224572	224584	224565	224565	he	312	‘ then you do n’t know what she ’s capable of . ’
224932	224938	224940	224941	Dr Lumbey	492	‘ Well , Mr. Kenwigs , ’
224943	224959	224940	224941	Dr Lumbey	492	‘ this makes six . You ’ll have a fine family in time , sir . ’
224960	224970	224972	224973	Mr. Kenwigs	312	‘ I think six is almost enough , sir , ’
224975	224980	224982	224983	the doctor	1476	‘ Pooh ! pooh ! ’
224985	224992	224982	224983	the doctor	1476	‘ Nonsense ! not half enough . ’

225094	225102	225084	225084	they	5094	’ said Mr. Lumbey , the doctor . ‘
225116	225122	225109	225109	I	0	’ asked the married lady . ‘

225251	225281	225247	225249	Mrs. Kenwigs ’s	310	’ said Mr. Kenwigs , taking a pinch of snuff from the doctor ’s box , and then sneezing very hard , for he was n’t used to it , ‘

225314	225324	225311	225311	you	0	’ observed the married lady , nodding her head . ‘
225342	225352	225333	225333	I	0	’ said Mr. Kenwigs , with a portentous look . ‘

225389	225402	225384	225384	I	0	’ said the married lady , with a glance towards Dr Lumbey . ‘
225432	225437	225417	225421	such a man as that	5107	’ pursued Mr Kenwigs . ‘
225477	225515	225516	225517	That girl	3677	’ Having delivered his sentiments in this form of words , Mr. Kenwigs arranged his second daughter ’s flaxen tail , and bade her be a good girl and mind what her sister , Morleena , said . ‘
225526	225540	225516	225517	That girl	3677	’ said Mr. Lumbey , suddenly stricken with an enthusiastic admiration of Morleena . ‘
225543	225549	225551	225551	I	0	’ rejoined the married lady . ‘
225569	225608	225561	225561	She	3677	’ Having thus directed the general attention to the young lady in question , the married lady embraced the opportunity of taking another sip of the brandy - and - water -- and a pretty long sip too . ‘
225616	225625	225556	225556	I	0	’ said Mr. Kenwigs , after some reflection . ‘
225647	225672	225643	225645	such a woman	5117	’ Mr. Lumbey shook his head with great solemnity , as though to imply that he supposed she must have been rather a dazzler . ‘
225677	225681	225643	225645	such a woman	5117	’ cried Mr. Kenwigs ‘
225718	225727	225729	225729	her	5117	’ said Mr. Kenwigs , dropping his voice ; ‘
225756	225757	225954	225954	I	0	’ ‘
225766	225772	225954	225954	I	0	’ urged the married lady . ‘

225787	225792	225774	225774	SHE	5117	’ cried the doctor . ‘
225803	225809	225793	225793	She	5117	’ said the married lady . ‘
225814	225819	225811	225811	she	5117	’ assented Mr. Lumbey . ‘
225825	225911	225811	225811	she	5117	’ Mr. Kenwigs was about to make some further observations , most probably in confirmation of this opinion , when another married lady , who had looked in to keep up Mrs. Kenwigs ’s spirits , and help to clear off anything in the eating and drinking way that might be going about , put in her head to announce that she had just been down to answer the bell , and that there was a gentleman at the door who wanted to see Mr. Kenwigs ‘
225915	225951	225811	225811	she	5117	’ Shadowy visions of his distinguished relation flitted through the brain of Mr. Kenwigs , as this message was delivered ; and under their influence , he dispatched Morleena to show the gentleman up straightway . ‘
225958	225983	225954	225954	I	0	’ said Mr. Kenwigs , standing opposite the door so as to get the earliest glimpse of the visitor , as he came upstairs , ‘
225997	226071	225995	225995	sir	714	’ Nicholas shook hands , kissed his old pupils all round , intrusted a large parcel of toys to the guardianship of Morleena , bowed to the doctor and the married ladies , and inquired after Mrs. Kenwigs in a tone of interest , which went to the very heart and soul of the nurse , who had come in to warm some mysterious compound , in a little saucepan over the fire . ‘
226088	226092	226072	226072	I	0	’ said Nicholas , ‘

226229	226233	226172	226172	You	0	’ resumed Nicholas , ‘

226355	226359	226341	226341	I	0	’ suggested Nicholas . ‘

226416	226458	226550	226551	Mr. Lillyvick	316	’ Hearing this mention of their old friend ’s name , the four Miss Kenwigses gathered round Nicholas , open eyed and mouthed , to hear more . Mr. Kenwigs looked a little curious too , but quite comfortable and unsuspecting . ‘
226466	226472	226550	226551	Mr. Lillyvick	316	’ said Nicholas , hesitating . ‘
226478	226508	226550	226551	Mr. Lillyvick	316	’ said Kenwigs , glancing at Mr. Lumbey , who , having rashly taken charge of little Lillyvick , found nobody disposed to relieve him of his precious burden . ‘
226513	226529	226550	226551	Mr. Lillyvick	316	’ Nicholas hemmed once or twice , and seemed to have some difficulty in proceeding . ‘
226537	226542	226533	226534	Henrietta Petowker	428	’ observed Mr. Kenwigs . ‘
226545	226549	226550	226551	Mr. Lillyvick	316	’ said Nicholas , ‘
226555	226575	226550	226551	Mr. Lillyvick	316	’ Mr. Kenwigs turned pale , but he recovered , and said , THAT was an odd coincidence also . ‘
226582	226633	226580	226580	him	5133	’ said Nicholas . Mr. Kenwigs appeared to revive . He knew that his niece was in a delicate state , and had , no doubt , sent word that they were to forward full particulars . Yes . That was very kind of him ; so like him too ! ‘
226643	226647	226634	226634	He	5133	’ said Nicholas . ‘
226655	226668	226670	226671	Mr. Kenwigs	312	’m sure . Your great - uncle , Lillyvick , my dears ! ’
226680	226685	226687	226687	Nicholas	207	‘ His kindest love , ’
226689	226710	226687	226687	Nicholas	207	‘ and to say that he had no time to write , but that he was married to Miss Petowker . ’
226777	226787	226789	226790	Mr. Kenwigs	312	‘ My children , my defrauded , swindled infants ! ’

226837	226842	226844	226845	the nurse	8492	‘ Drat the man ! ’

227364	227377	227360	227361	the matrons	5149	‘ but it ’ll all come home to him , never fear . ’

230259	230265	230267	230268	brother Charles	355	‘ Tim Linkinwater , sir , ’
230270	230315	230267	230268	brother Charles	355	‘ give me your hand , sir . This is your birthday . How dare you talk about anything else till you have been wished many happy returns of the day , Tim Linkinwater ? God bless you , Tim ! God bless you ! ’

230332	230347	230323	230324	the other	8439	‘ Tim Linkinwater looks ten years younger than he did on his last birthday . ’
230348	230356	230358	230361	the other old fellow	5231	‘ Brother Ned , my dear boy , ’
230363	230403	230358	230361	the other old fellow	5231	‘ I believe that Tim Linkinwater was born a hundred and fifty years old , and is gradually coming down to five - and - twenty ; for he ’s younger every birthday than he was the year before . ’
230404	230416	230418	230419	brother Ned	484	‘ So he is , brother Charles , so he is , ’
230421	230430	230418	230419	brother Ned	484	‘ There ’s not a doubt about it . ’
230431	230436	230439	230439	Charles	355	‘ Remember , Tim , ’
230441	230598	230438	230439	brother Charles	12852	‘ that we dine at half - past five today instead of two o’clock ; we always depart from our usual custom on this anniversary , as you very well know , Tim Linkinwater . Mr. Nickleby , my dear sir , you will make one . Tim Linkinwater , give me your snuff - box as a remembrance to brother Charles and myself of an attached and faithful rascal , and take that , in exchange , as a feeble mark of our respect and esteem , and do n’t open it until you go to bed , and never say another word upon the subject , or I ’ll kill the blackbird . A dog ! He should have had a golden cage half - a - dozen years ago , if it would have made him or his master a bit the happier . Now , brother Ned , my dear fellow , I ’m
230633	230903	230630	230631	brother Ned	12823	’ Chattering away thus , according to custom , to prevent the possibility of any thanks or acknowledgment being expressed on the other side , the twins trotted off , arm - in - arm ; having endowed Tim Linkinwater with a costly gold snuff - box , enclosing a bank note worth more than its value ten times told . At a quarter past five o’clock , punctual to the minute , arrived , according to annual usage , Tim Linkinwater ’s sister ; and a great to - do there was , between Tim Linkinwater ’s sister and the old housekeeper , respecting Tim Linkinwater ’s sister ’s cap , which had been dispatched , per boy , from the house of the family where Tim Linkinwater ’s sister boarded , and had not yet come to hand : notwithstanding that it had been packed up in a bandbox , and the bandbox in a handkerchief , and the handkerchief tied on to the boy ’s arm ; and notwithstanding , too , that the place of its consignment had been duly set forth , at full length , on the back of an old letter , and the boy enjoined , under pain of divers horrible penalties , the full extent of which the eye of man could not foresee , to deliver the same with all possible speed , and not to loiter by the way . Tim Linkinwater ’s sister lamented ; the housekeeper condoled ; and both kept thrusting their heads out of the second - floor window to see if the boy was ‘
231263	231274	231276	231276	Ned	484	‘ For these and all other blessings , brother Charles , ’
231278	231289	231291	231291	Charles	355	‘ Lord , make us truly thankful , brother Ned , ’
231686	231813	231678	231678	he	5262	‘ Brother Charles , my dear fellow , there is another association connected with this day which must never be forgotten , and never can be forgotten , by you and me . This day , which brought into the world a most faithful and excellent and exemplary fellow , took from it the kindest and very best of parents , the very best of parents to us both . I wish that she could have seen us in our prosperity , and shared it , and had the happiness of knowing how dearly we loved her in it , as we did when we were two poor boys ; but that was not to be . My dear brother -- The Memory of our Mother . ’
231814	231818	231820	231820	Nicholas	207	‘ Good Lord ! ’
231822	231864	231820	231820	Nicholas	207	‘ and there are scores of people of their own station , knowing all this , and twenty thousand times more , who would n’t ask these men to dinner because they eat with their knives and never went to school ! ’
231905	231908	231910	231911	brother Ned	484	‘ David , ’
231913	231916	231918	231919	the butler	5264	‘ Sir , ’
231921	231940	231918	231919	the butler	5264	‘ A magnum of the double - diamond , David , to drink the health of Mr Linkinwater . ’
232017	232020	232022	232023	brother Ned	484	‘ Ha ! ’
232066	232073	232083	232083	David	496	‘ this looks well , David . ’
232074	232081	232083	232083	David	496	‘ It ought to , sir , ’
232085	232128	232083	232083	David	496	‘ You ’d be troubled to find such a glass of wine as is our double - diamond , and that Mr. Linkinwater knows very well . That was laid down when Mr. Linkinwater first come : that wine was , gentlemen . ’
232129	232136	232138	232139	brother Charles	355	‘ Nay , David , nay , ’
232141	232159	232161	232161	David	496	‘ I wrote the entry in the cellar - book myself , sir , if you please , ’
232179	232202	232161	232161	David	496	‘ Mr. Linkinwater had only been here twenty year , sir , when that pipe of double - diamond was laid down . ’
232203	232215	232217	232217	Ned	484	‘ David is quite right , quite right , brother Charles , ’
232219	232227	232217	232217	Ned	484	‘ are the people here , David ? ’
232228	232235	232237	232238	the butler	5264	‘ Outside the door , sir , ’
232240	232242	232243	232243	em	5273	‘ Show ‘
232249	232253	232246	232246	David	496	‘ em in . ’
232322	232325	232327	232328	brother Ned	484	‘ Seven , ’
232342	232353	232327	232328	brother Ned	484	‘ and David , eight . There ! Now , you ’re
232424	232553	232554	232554	We	5285	’ With this singular contradiction of terms , brother Ned gave Tim Linkinwater a slap on the back , which made him look , for the moment , almost as apoplectic as the butler : and tossed off the contents of his glass in a twinkling . The toast was scarcely drunk with all honour to Tim Linkinwater , when the sturdiest and jolliest subordinate elbowed himself a little in advance of his fellows , and exhibiting a very hot and flushed countenance , pulled a single lock of grey hair in the middle of his forehead as a respectful salute to the company , and delivered himself as follows -- rubbing the palms of his hands very hard on a blue cotton handkerchief as he did so : ‘
232555	232675	232411	232411	Devil	267	’re allowed to take a liberty once a year , gen’lemen , and if you please we ’ll take it now ; there being no time like the present , and no two birds in the hand worth one in the bush , as is well known -- leastways in a contrairy sense , which the meaning is the same . ( A pause -- the butler unconvinced . ) What we mean to say is , that there never was ( looking at the butler)--such--(looking at the cook ) noble -- excellent--(looking everywhere and seeing nobody ) free , generous - spirited masters as them as has treated us so handsome this day . And here ’s thanking of ‘
232702	232948	232411	232411	Devil	267	’ When the foregoing speech was over -- and it might have been much more elegant and much less to the purpose -- the whole body of subordinates under command of the apoplectic butler gave three soft cheers ; which , to that gentleman ’s great indignation , were not very regular , inasmuch as the women persisted in giving an immense number of little shrill hurrahs among themselves , in utter disregard of the time . This done , they withdrew ; shortly afterwards , Tim Linkinwater ’s sister withdrew ; in reasonable time after that , the sitting was broken up for tea and coffee , and a round game of cards . At half - past ten -- late hours for the square -- there appeared a little tray of sandwiches and a bowl of bishop , which bishop coming on the top of the double - diamond , and other excitements , had such an effect upon Tim Linkinwater , that he drew Nicholas aside , and gave him to understand , confidentially , that it was quite true about the uncommonly handsome spinster , and that she was to the full as good - looking as she had been described -- more so , indeed -- but that she was in too much of a hurry to change her condition , and consequently , while Tim was courting her and thinking of changing his , got married to somebody else . ‘
232960	232964	232952	232952	I	0	’ said Tim . ‘
233026	233400	233024	233024	sir	714	’ By this time it was past eleven o’clock ; and Tim Linkinwater ’s sister declaring that she ought to have been at home a full hour ago , a coach was procured , into which she was handed with great ceremony by brother Ned , while brother Charles imparted the fullest directions to the coachman , and besides paying the man a shilling over and above his fare , in order that he might take the utmost care of the lady , all but choked him with a glass of spirits of uncommon strength , and then nearly knocked all the breath out of his body in his energetic endeavours to knock it in again . At length the coach rumbled off , and Tim Linkinwater ’s sister being now fairly on her way home , Nicholas and Tim Linkinwater ’s friend took their leaves together , and left old Tim and the worthy brothers to their repose . As Nicholas had some distance to walk , it was considerably past midnight by the time he reached home , where he found his mother and Smike sitting up to receive him . It was long after their usual hour of retiring , and they had expected him , at the very latest , two hours ago ; but the time had not hung heavily on their hands , for Mrs. Nickleby had entertained Smike with a genealogical account of her family by the mother ’s side , comprising biographical sketches of the principal members , and Smike had sat wondering what it was all about , and whether it was learnt from a book , or said out of Mrs. Nickleby ’s own head ; so that they got on together very pleasantly . Nicholas could not go to bed without expatiating on the excellences and munificence of the brothers Cheeryble , and relating the great success which had attended his efforts that day . But before he had said a dozen words , Mrs. Nickleby , with many sly winks and nods , observed , that she was sure Mr. Smike must be quite tired out , and that she positively must insist on his not sitting up a minute longer . ‘
233412	233430	233405	233405	he	5293	’ said Mrs. Nickleby , when Smike had wished them good - night and left the room . ‘
233546	233594	233595	233595	People	622	’ With which preface , Mrs. Nickleby took her nightcap from between the leaves of a very large prayer - book where it had been folded up small , and proceeded to tie it on : talking away in her usual discursive manner , all the time . ‘
233602	233607	233595	233595	People	622	’ observed Mrs. Nickleby , ‘
233622	233780	233599	233599	they	622	’m sure you would confess , Nicholas my dear , if you would only have strings to yours , and wear it like a Christian , instead of sticking it upon the very top of your head like a blue - coat boy . You need n’t think it an unmanly or quizzical thing to be particular about your nightcap , for I have often heard your poor dear papa , and the Reverend Mr. What’s - his - name , who used to read prayers in that old church with the curious little steeple that the weathercock was blown off the night week before you were born,--I have often heard them say , that the young men at college are uncommonly particular about their nightcaps , and that the Oxford nightcaps are quite celebrated for their strength and goodness ; so much so , indeed , that the young men never dream of going to bed without ‘
233805	233881	233882	233884	the Mr. Cherrybles	497	’ Nicholas laughed , and entering no further into the subject of this lengthened harangue , reverted to the pleasant tone of the little birthday party . And as Mrs. Nickleby instantly became very curious respecting it , and made a great number of inquiries touching what they had had for dinner , and how it was put on table , and whether it was overdone or underdone , and who was there , and what ‘
233885	233920	233882	233884	the Mr. Cherrybles	497	’ said , and what Nicholas said , and what the Mr. Cherrybles said when he said that ; Nicholas described the festivities at full length , and also the occurrences of the morning . ‘
233926	233930	233882	233884	the Mr. Cherrybles	497	’ said Nicholas , ‘
233962	233963	233948	233948	I	0	’ ‘
233968	233997	233966	233966	Kate	210	’ said Mrs. Nickleby , putting her feet upon the fender , and drawing her chair close to it , as if settling herself for a long talk . ‘
234013	234108	234012	234012	I	0	’m very glad , Nicholas my dear , that I prevailed upon her not to sit up , for I wished very much to have an opportunity of saying a few words to you . I am naturally anxious about it , and of course it ’s a very delightful and consoling thing to have a grown - up son that one can put confidence in , and advise with ; indeed I do n’t know any use there would be in having sons at all , unless people could put confidence in them . ’
234134	234143	234145	234146	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ There was a lady in our neighbourhood , ’
234148	234196	234145	234146	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ speaking of sons puts me in mind of it -- a lady in our neighbourhood when we lived near Dawlish , I think her name was Rogers ; indeed I am sure it was if it was n’t Murphy , which is the only doubt I have-- ’
234197	234213	234215	234215	Nicholas	207	‘ Is it about her , mother , that you wished to speak to me ? ’
234218	234222	234224	234225	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ About HER ! ’
234227	234282	234284	234285	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ Good gracious , Nicholas , my dear , how CAN you be so ridiculous ! But that was always the way with your poor dear papa,--just his way -- always wandering , never able to fix his thoughts on any one subject for two minutes together . I think I see him now ! ’
234291	234348	234284	234285	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ looking at me while I was talking to him about his affairs , just as if his ideas were in a state of perfect conglomeration ! Anybody who had come in upon us suddenly , would have supposed I was confusing and distracting him instead of making things plainer ; upon my word they would . ’
234349	234367	234369	234369	Nicholas	207	‘ I am very sorry , mother , that I should inherit this unfortunate slowness of apprehension , ’
234373	234396	234369	234369	Nicholas	207	‘ but I ’ll do my best to understand you , if you ’ll only go straight on : indeed I will . ’
234397	234402	234404	234405	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ Your poor pa ! ’
234409	234428	234404	234405	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ He never knew , till it was too late , what I would have had him do ! ’
234470	234473	234475	234476	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ However , ’
234482	234503	234475	234476	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ this has nothing to do -- certainly nothing whatever to do -- with the gentleman in the next house . ’
234504	234523	234525	234525	Nicholas	207	‘ I should suppose that the gentleman in the next house has as little to do with us , ’
234527	234534	234536	234537	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ There can be no doubt , ’
234539	234634	234636	234637	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ that he IS a gentleman , and has the manners of a gentleman , and the appearance of a gentleman , although he does wear smalls and grey worsted stockings . That may be eccentricity , or he may be proud of his legs . I do n’t see why he should n’t be . The Prince Regent was proud of his legs , and so was Daniel Lambert , who was also a fat man ; HE was proud of his legs . So was Miss Biffin : she was -- no , ’
234643	234658	234641	234641	herself	207	‘ I think she had only toes , but the principle is the same . ’
234685	234697	234698	234698	she	207	‘ You may well be surprised , Nicholas , my dear , ’
234701	234811	234698	234698	she	207	‘ I am sure I was . It came upon me like a flash of fire , and almost froze my blood . The bottom of his garden joins the bottom of ours , and of course I had several times seen him sitting among the scarlet - beans in his little arbour , or working at his little hot - beds . I used to think he stared rather , but I did n’t take any particular notice of that , as we were newcomers , and he might be curious to see what we were like . But when he began to throw his cucumbers over our wall-- ’
234812	234821	234823	234823	Nicholas	207	‘ To throw his cucumbers over our wall ! ’
234829	234837	234839	234840	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ Yes , Nicholas , my dear , ’

234860	234865	234867	234867	Nicholas	207	‘ Confound his impudence ! ’
234872	234880	234867	234867	Nicholas	207	‘ What does he mean by that ? ’
234881	234893	234895	234896	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ I do n’t think he means it impertinently at all , ’
234898	234901	234903	234903	Nicholas	207	‘ What ! ’
234905	234933	234903	234903	Nicholas	207	‘ cucumbers and vegetable marrows flying at the heads of the family as they walk in their own garden , and not meant impertinently ! Why , mother-- ’
234970	234985	234987	234988	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ He must be a very weak , and foolish , and inconsiderate man , ’
234990	235112	234987	234988	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ blamable indeed -- at least I suppose other people would consider him so ; of course I ca n’t be expected to express any opinion on that point , especially after always defending your poor dear papa when other people blamed him for making proposals to me ; and to be sure there can be no doubt that he has taken a very singular way of showing it . Still at the same time , his attentions are -- that is , as far as it goes , and to a certain extent of course -- a flattering sort of thing ; and although I should never dream of marrying again with a dear girl like Kate still unsettled in life-- ’
235113	235129	235131	235131	Nicholas	207	‘ Surely , mother , such an idea never entered your brain for an instant ? ’
235133	235142	235131	235131	Nicholas	207	‘ Bless my heart , Nicholas my dear , ’
235151	235244	235246	235247	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ is n’t that precisely what I am saying , if you would only let me speak ? Of course , I never gave it a second thought , and I am surprised and astonished that you should suppose me capable of such a thing . All I say is , what step is the best to take , so as to reject these advances civilly and delicately , and without hurting his feelings too much , and driving him to despair , or anything of that kind ? My goodness me ! ’
235255	235276	235246	235247	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ suppose he was to go doing anything rash to himself . Could I ever be happy again , Nicholas ? ’
235293	235317	235290	235290	he	5304	‘ Now , do you think , mother , that such a result would be likely to ensue from the most cruel repulse ? ’
235318	235331	235333	235334	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ Upon my word , my dear , I do n’t know , ’
235336	235485	235333	235334	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ really , I do n’t know . I am sure there was a case in the day before yesterday ’s paper , extracted from one of the French newspapers , about a journeyman shoemaker who was jealous of a young girl in an adjoining village , because she would n’t shut herself up in an air - tight three - pair - of - stairs , and charcoal herself to death with him ; and who went and hid himself in a wood with a sharp - pointed knife , and rushed out , as she was passing by with a few friends , and killed himself first , and then all the friends , and then her -- no , killed all the friends first , and then herself , and then HIMself -- which it is quite frightful to think of . Somehow or other , ’
235495	235529	235487	235488	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ they always ARE journeyman shoemakers who do these things in France , according to the papers . I do n’t know how it is -- something in the leather , I suppose . ’
235530	235553	235555	235555	Nicholas	207	‘ But this man , who is not a shoemaker -- what has he done , mother , what has he said ? ’
235574	235596	235572	235572	herself	207	‘ You know , there is no language of vegetables , which converts a cucumber into a formal declaration of attachment . ’
235597	235601	235603	235604	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ My dear , ’
235618	235629	235607	235607	her	207	‘ he has done and said all sorts of things . ’
235630	235639	235641	235641	Nicholas	207	‘ Is there no mistake on your part ? ’
235643	235646	235648	235649	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ Mistake ! ’
235651	235672	235648	235649	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ Lord , Nicholas my dear , do you suppose I do n’t know when a man ’s in earnest ? ’
235673	235678	235680	235680	Nicholas	207	‘ Well , well ! ’
235682	235691	235693	235694	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ Every time I go to the window , ’
235696	235818	235693	235694	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ he kisses one hand , and lays the other upon his heart -- of course it ’s very foolish of him to do so , and I dare say you ’ll say it ’s very wrong , but he does it very respectfully -- very respectfully indeed -- and very tenderly , extremely tenderly . So far , he deserves the greatest credit ; there can be no doubt about that . Then , there are the presents which come pouring over the wall every day , and very fine they certainly are , very fine ; we had one of the cucumbers at dinner yesterday , and think of pickling the rest for next winter . And last evening , ’
235827	235897	235820	235821	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ he called gently over the wall , as I was walking in the garden , and proposed marriage , and an elopement . His voice is as clear as a bell or a musical glass -- very like a musical glass indeed -- but of course I did n’t listen to it . Then , the question is , Nicholas my dear , what am I to do ? ’
235898	235905	235907	235907	Nicholas	207	‘ Does Kate know of this ? ’
235909	235920	235907	235907	Nicholas	207	‘ I have not said a word about it yet , ’
235925	235933	235935	235935	Nicholas	207	‘ Then , for Heaven ’s sake , ’
235939	236106	235935	235935	Nicholas	207	‘ do not , for it would make her very unhappy . And with regard to what you should do , my dear mother , do what your good sense and feeling , and respect for my father ’s memory , would prompt . There are a thousand ways in which you can show your dislike of these preposterous and doting attentions . If you act as decidedly as you ought and they are still continued , and to your annoyance , I can speedily put a stop to them . But I should not interfere in a matter so ridiculous , and attach importance to it , until you have vindicated yourself . Most women can do that , but especially one of your age and condition , in circumstances like these , which are unworthy of a serious thought . I would not shame you by seeming to take them to heart , or treat them earnestly for an instant . Absurd old idiot ! ’
236246	236259	236261	236262	Mrs Nickleby	207	‘ As to its being preposterous , and doting , and ridiculous , ’
236272	236332	236261	236262	Mrs Nickleby	207	‘ I do n’t see that , at all . It ’s hopeless on his part , certainly ; but why he should be an absurd old idiot , I confess I do n’t see . He is not to be supposed to know it ’s hopeless . Poor fellow ! He is to be pitied , I think ! ’

236776	236800	236772	236774	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ for I have thought of nothing but hammers , nails , screwdrivers , and gimlets , morning , noon , and night . ’

236853	236888	236849	236851	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ By - the - bye , I HAVE thought of somebody too . Do you know , that I observe a great change in one of this family -- a very extraordinary change ? ’
236889	236893	236895	236895	Kate	210	‘ In whom ? ’
236899	236902	236895	236895	Kate	210	‘ Not in-- ’
236903	236912	236914	236916	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ Not in your brother , my dear , ’
236925	237003	236914	236916	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ for he is always the same affectionate good - natured clever creature , with a spice of the -- I wo n’t say who -- in him when there ’s any occasion , that he was when I first knew you . No . Smike , as he WILL be called , poor fellow ! for he wo n’t hear of a MR before his name , is greatly altered , even in this short time . ’
237004	237007	237009	237009	Kate	210	‘ How ? ’
237011	237016	236914	236916	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ Not in health ? ’

237074	237078	236914	236916	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ How then ? ’
237079	237084	237086	237088	the miniature painter	1905	‘ I scarcely know , ’
237090	237307	237086	237088	the miniature painter	1905	‘ But I have watched him , and he has brought the tears into my eyes many times . It is not a very difficult matter to do that , certainly , for I am easily melted ; still I think these came with good cause and reason . I am sure that since he has been here , he has grown , from some strong cause , more conscious of his weak intellect . He feels it more . It gives him greater pain to know that he wanders sometimes , and can not understand very simple things . I have watched him when you have not been by , my dear , sit brooding by himself , with such a look of pain as I could scarcely bear to see , and then get up and leave the room : so sorrowfully , and in such dejection , that I can not tell you how it has hurt me . Not three weeks ago , he was a light - hearted busy creature , overjoyed to be in a bustle , and as happy as the day was long . Now , he is another being -- the same willing , harmless , faithful , loving creature -- but the same in nothing else . ’
237308	237316	237318	237318	Kate	210	‘ Surely this will all pass off , ’
237320	237324	237318	237318	Kate	210	‘ Poor fellow ! ’

237383	237560	237365	237367	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ I have said my say , and a very long say it is , and a very wrong say too , I should n’t wonder at all . I shall cheer him up tonight , at all events , for if he is to be my squire all the way to the Strand , I shall talk on , and on , and on , and never leave off , till I have roused him into a laugh at something . So the sooner he goes , the better for him , and the sooner I go , the better for me , I am sure , or else I shall have my maid gallivanting with somebody who may rob the house -- though what there is to take away , besides tables and chairs , I do n’t know , except the miniatures : and he is a clever thief who can dispose of them to any great advantage , for I ca n’t , I know , and that ’s the honest truth . ’
237755	237759	237761	237763	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ the omnibus , ’
237766	237780	237761	237763	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ swore so dreadfully , that it was quite awful to hear it . ’
237877	238138	237876	237878	brewers ’ drays	13166	’ drays at least . Leaving it to pursue its journey at the pleasure of the conductor aforementioned , who lounged gracefully on his little shelf behind , smoking an odoriferous cigar ; and leaving it to stop , or go on , or gallop , or crawl , as that gentleman deemed expedient and advisable ; this narrative may embrace the opportunity of ascertaining the condition of Sir Mulberry Hawk , and to what extent he had , by this time , recovered from the injuries consequent on being flung violently from his cabriolet , under the circumstances already detailed . With a shattered limb , a body severely bruised , a face disfigured by half - healed scars , and pallid from the exhaustion of recent pain and fever , Sir Mulberry Hawk lay stretched upon his back , on the couch to which he was doomed to be a prisoner for some weeks yet to come . Mr. Pyke and Mr. Pluck sat drinking hard in the next room , now and then varying the monotonous murmurs of their conversation with a half - smothered laugh , while the young lord -- the only member of the party who was not thoroughly irredeemable , and who really had a kind heart -- sat beside his Mentor , with a cigar in his mouth , and read to him , by the light of a lamp , such scraps of intelligence from a paper of the day , as were most likely to yield him interest or amusement . ‘
238143	238157	237876	237878	brewers ’ drays	13166	’ said the invalid , turning his head impatiently towards the adjoining room ; ‘
238165	238204	237876	237878	brewers ’ drays	13166	’ Messrs Pyke and Pluck heard the exclamation , and stopped immediately : winking to each other as they did so , and filling their glasses to the brim , as some recompense for the deprivation of speech . ‘
238207	238223	237876	237878	brewers ’ drays	13166	’ muttered the sick man between his teeth , and writhing impatiently in his bed . ‘
238253	238254	237876	237878	brewers ’ drays	13166	’ ‘
238260	238265	237876	237878	brewers ’ drays	13166	’ replied his friend . ‘
238281	238286	237876	237878	brewers ’ drays	13166	’ said Sir Mulberry . ‘
238292	238482	237876	237878	brewers ’ drays	13166	’ It was curious to see how eagerly the sick man , debarred from any change of position save the mere turning of his head from side to side , watched every motion of his friend in the progress of the game ; and with what eagerness and interest he played , and yet how warily and coolly . His address and skill were more than twenty times a match for his adversary , who could make little head against them , even when fortune favoured him with good cards , which was not often the case . Sir Mulberry won every game ; and when his companion threw down the cards , and refused to play any longer , thrust forth his wasted arm and caught up the stakes with a boastful oath , and the same hoarse laugh , though considerably lowered in tone , that had resounded in Ralph Nickleby ’s dining - room , months before . While he was thus occupied , his man appeared , to announce that Mr. Ralph Nickleby was below , and wished to know how he was , tonight . ‘
238485	238492	237876	237878	brewers ’ drays	13166	’ said Sir Mulberry , impatiently . ‘
238500	238501	238502	238502	I	0	’ ‘
238508	238550	238502	238502	I	0	’ replied Sir Mulberry , striking his hand upon the table . The man hesitated for a moment or two , and then said that Mr. Nickleby had requested permission to see Sir Mulberry Hawk , if it was not inconvenient . ‘
238567	238577	238561	238561	I	0	’ said his master , more violently than before . ‘
238585	238586	238582	238582	you	208	’ ‘
238594	238599	238592	238592	sir	714	’ returned the man . ‘
238608	238649	238651	238651	he	208	’ The fact was , that Ralph Nickleby had bribed the man , who , being anxious to earn his money with a view to future favours , held the door in his hand , and ventured to linger still . ‘
238662	238673	238651	238651	he	208	’ inquired Sir Mulberry , after a little impatient consideration . ‘
238696	238697	238690	238691	Mr. Nickleby	208	’ ‘
238706	238726	238680	238680	he	208	’ cried Sir Mulberry , calling the man back , as he passed his hand over his disfigured face , ‘
238758	238855	238858	238858	Nickleby	208	’ The man obeyed these directions as if he quite comprehended the motive with which they were dictated , and left the room . Lord Frederick Verisopht , remarking that he would look in presently , strolled into the adjoining apartment , and closed the folding door behind him . Then was heard a subdued footstep on the stairs ; and Ralph Nickleby , hat in hand , crept softly into the room , with his body bent forward as if in profound respect , and his eyes fixed upon the face of his worthy client . ‘
238860	238883	238858	238858	Nickleby	208	’ said Sir Mulberry , motioning him to the chair by the couch side , and waving his hand in assumed carelessness , ‘
238894	238895	238896	238896	I	0	’ ‘
238899	238909	238896	238896	I	0	’ rejoined Ralph , with the same steady gaze . ‘
238932	239033	238926	238926	dear	9456	’ Ralph ’s manner was one of profound humility and respect ; and the low tone of voice was that , which the gentlest consideration for a sick man would have taught a visitor to assume . But the expression of his face , Sir Mulberry ’s being averted , was in extraordinary contrast ; and as he stood , in his usual attitude , calmly looking on the prostrate form before him , all that part of his features which was not cast into shadow by his protruding and contracted brows , bore the impress of a sarcastic smile . ‘
239037	239053	238926	238926	dear	9456	’ said Sir Mulberry , turning towards him , as though by a violent effort . ‘
239065	239107	239060	239060	you	208	’ As he turned his face , Ralph recoiled a step or two , and making as though he were irresistibly impelled to express astonishment , but was determined not to do so , sat down with well - acted confusion . ‘
239121	239125	239060	239060	you	208	’ said Ralph , ‘
239174	239200	239167	239167	you	358	’ said Ralph , bending forward , and allowing the same harsh smile to gather upon his face , as the other closed his eyes . ‘
239238	239295	239234	239234	I	0	’ returned Sir Mulberry , tossing his arm restlessly upon the coverlet . Ralph shrugged his shoulders in deprecation of the intense irritation with which this had been said ; for there was an aggravating , cold distinctness in his speech and manner which so grated on the sick man that he could scarcely endure it . ‘
239313	239318	239234	239234	I	0	’ asked Sir Mulberry . ‘
239321	239325	239234	239234	I	0	’ replied Ralph . ‘
239353	239366	239367	239367	I	0	’ said Ralph , speaking more slowly , and with harsher emphasis , ‘
239394	239395	239367	239367	I	0	’ ‘
239398	239403	239404	239404	I	0	’ interposed Sir Mulberry . ‘
239413	239425	239404	239404	I	0	’ said Ralph , wilfully mistaking the meaning of the interruption , ‘
239484	239485	239479	239479	I	0	’ ‘
239502	239513	239489	239489	they	5361	’ asked Sir Mulberry , clenching his hands and teeth . ‘
239519	239523	239489	239489	they	5361	’ replied Ralph . ‘
239550	239560	239546	239546	I	0	’ said Ralph , looking eagerly at his questioner . ‘
239601	239602	239632	239632	he	0	’ ‘
239608	239613	239632	239632	he	0	’ said Sir Mulberry ; ‘

239636	239648	239630	239630	They	5361	’ observed Ralph , in the same unmoved and quiet manner . ‘
239657	239698	239651	239651	he	0	’S a lie , I know . I have said that boldly -- oh , a score of times ! I am a peaceable man , but I ca n’t hear folks tell that of you . No , no . ’

239763	239852	239747	239748	the invalid	13175	‘ I ’ll have such revenge as never man had yet . By God , I will . Accident favouring him , he has marked me for a week or two , but I ’ll put a mark on him that he shall carry to his grave . I ’ll slit his nose and ears , flog him , maim him for life . I ’ll do more than that ; I ’ll drag that pattern of chastity , that pink of prudery , the delicate sister , through-- ’
239927	239934	239936	239936	Ralph	208	‘ It is a galling thing , ’
239954	239985	239947	239947	he	208	‘ to think that the man about town , the rake , the ROUE , the rook of twenty seasons should be brought to this pass by a mere boy ! ’
240017	240024	240026	240026	Ralph	208	‘ A raw , slight stripling , ’
240028	240054	240056	240056	Ralph	208	‘ against a man whose very weight might crush him ; to say nothing of his skill in -- I am right , I think , ’

240095	240098	240099	240099	he	208	‘ Ha ! ’
240102	240155	240099	240099	he	208	‘ I thought so . That was before I knew you , but I was pretty sure I could n’t be mistaken . He is light and active , I suppose . But those were slight advantages compared with yours . Luck , luck ! These hang - dog outcasts have it . ’
240156	240171	240173	240175	Sir Mulberry Hawk	358	‘ He ’ll need the most he has , when I am well again , ’

240369	240397	240365	240367	the young man	900	‘ I neyver heard such an insufferable riot . Croak , croak , croak . Bow , wow , wow . What has it all been about ? ’
240398	240408	240410	240410	Ralph	208	‘ Sir Mulberry has been angry , my Lord , ’

As it is , you did wrong . I did wrong too , not to interfere , and I am sorry for it . What happened to you afterwards , was as much the consequence of accident as design , and more your fault than his ; and it shall not , with my knowledge , be cruelly visited upon him , it shall not indeed . ’

242289	242297	242284	242284	I	0	’ replied Smike , looking wildly round . ‘
242305	242310	242312	242313	Mr. Squeers	203	’re about right there , ’
242315	242383	242385	242386	Mr. Squeers	203	‘ You ’ll go home very soon , you will . You ’ll find yourself at the peaceful village of Dotheboys , in Yorkshire , in something under a week ’s time , my young friend ; and the next time you get away from there , I give you leave to keep away . Where ’s the clothes you run off in , you ungrateful robber ? ’
242414	242440	242442	242442	Squeers	203	‘ Do you know that I could hang you up , outside of the Old Bailey , for making away with them articles of property ? ’
242444	242570	242442	242442	Squeers	203	‘ Do you know that it ’s a hanging matter -- and I an’t quite certain whether it an’t an anatomy one besides -- to walk off with up’ards of the valley of five pound from a dwelling - house ? Eh ? Do you know that ? What do you suppose was the worth of them clothes you had ? Do you know that that Wellington boot you wore , cost eight - and - twenty shillings when it was a pair , and the shoe seven - and - six ? But you came to the right shop for mercy when you came to me , and thank your stars that it IS me as has got to serve you with the article . ’
242657	242669	242671	242672	Mr. Squeers	203	‘ I never threshed a boy in a hackney coach before , ’
242680	242699	242671	242672	Mr. Squeers	203	‘ There ’s inconveniency in it , but the novelty gives it a sort of relish , too ! ’

242905	242917	242919	242920	the coachman	1182	‘ What are you pulling a man ’s arm off for ? ’
242925	242931	242933	242933	Squeers	203	‘ That ’s the house , ’
242935	242967	242933	242933	Squeers	203	‘ The second of them four little houses , one story high , with the green shutters . There ’s brass plate on the door , with the name of Snawley . ’
242968	242984	242986	242987	the coachman	1182	‘ Could n’t you say that without wrenching a man ’s limbs off his body ? ’
242989	242992	242994	242995	Mr. Squeers	203	‘ No ! ’
242997	243015	242994	242995	Mr. Squeers	203	‘ Say another word , and I ’ll summons you for having a broken winder . Stop ! ’

243179	243188	243190	243190	Snawley	232	‘ What ! The boy that run away ! ’
243211	243215	243218	243218	Squeers	203	‘ The very boy ’

243297	243312	243314	243315	Mr Snawley	232	‘ It ’s clear that there has been a Providence in it , sir , ’
243347	243356	243358	243359	Mr. Squeers	203	‘ Providence is against him , no doubt , ’
243365	243381	243358	243359	Mr. Squeers	203	‘ Of course ; that was to be expected . Anybody might have known that . ’
243382	243396	243398	243399	Mr Snawley	232	‘ Hard - heartedness and evil - doing will never prosper , sir , ’
243401	243409	243411	243411	Squeers	203	‘ Never was such a thing known , ’
243433	243441	243443	243444	Mr. Squeers	203	‘ I have been , Mr. Snawley , ’
243455	243575	243443	243444	Mr. Squeers	203	‘ I have been that chap ’s benefactor , feeder , teacher , and clother . I have been that chap ’s classical , commercial , mathematical , philosophical , and trigonomical friend . My son -- my only son , Wackford -- has been his brother ; Mrs. Squeers has been his mother , grandmother , aunt,--ah ! and I may say uncle too , all in one . She never cottoned to anybody , except them two engaging and delightful boys of yours , as she cottoned to this chap . What ’s my return ? What ’s come of my milk of human kindness ? It turns into curds and whey when I look at him . ’
243576	243583	243585	243586	Mrs. Snawley	504	‘ Well it may , sir , ’

244559	244576	244554	244555	John Browdie	505	‘ and I was very sorry when she woke , for she has been SO cross ! ’

244698	244753	244678	244678	John	505	’ After several burrowings into the old corner , and many exclamations of impatience and fatigue , the figure struggled into a sitting posture ; and there , under a mass of crumpled beaver , and surrounded by a semicircle of blue curl - papers , were the delicate features of Miss Fanny Squeers . ‘
244756	244759	244761	244762	Miss Squeers	282	‘ Tilda ! ’

244815	244822	244761	244762	Miss Squeers	282	’ said Miss Squeers , impressively , ‘

245075	245080	245069	245069	Tilda	284	’ remonstrated Miss Squeers , ‘

245135	245144	245132	245133	Mr. Browdie	202	’ replied Miss Squeers , looking singularly dismal . ‘
245149	245153	245132	245133	Mr. Browdie	202	’ said John , ‘
245169	245179	245132	245133	Mr. Browdie	202	‘ account of poor old feyther deein , and puttin ’

245227	245630	245222	245222	I	0	’ So , in order that he might begin to enjoy himself at once , and lose no time , Mr. Browdie gave his wife a hearty kiss , and succeeded in wresting another from Miss Squeers , after a maidenly resistance of scratching and struggling on the part of that young lady , which was not quite over when they reached the Saracen ’s Head . Here , the party straightway retired to rest ; the refreshment of sleep being necessary after so long a journey ; and here they met again about noon , to a substantial breakfast , spread by direction of Mr. John Browdie , in a small private room upstairs commanding an uninterrupted view of the stables . To have seen Miss Squeers now , divested of the brown beaver , the green veil , and the blue curl - papers , and arrayed in all the virgin splendour of a white frock and spencer , with a white muslin bonnet , and an imitative damask rose in full bloom on the inside thereof -- her luxuriant crop of hair arranged in curls so tight that it was impossible they could come out by any accident , and her bonnet - cap trimmed with little damask roses , which might be supposed to be so many promising scions of the big rose -- to have seen all this , and to have seen the broad damask belt , matching both the family rose and the little roses , which encircled her slender waist , and by a happy ingenuity took off from the shortness of the spencer behind,--to have beheld all this , and to have taken further into account the coral bracelets ( rather short of beads , and with a very visible black string ) which clasped her wrists , and the coral necklace which rested on her neck , supporting , outside her frock , a lonely cornelian heart , typical of her own disengaged affections -- to have contemplated all these mute but expressive appeals to the purest feelings of our nature , might have thawed the frost of age , and added new and inextinguishable fuel to the fire of youth . The waiter was touched . Waiter as he was , he had human passions and feelings , and he looked very hard at Miss Squeers as he handed the muffins . ‘
245640	245647	245637	245637	you	5494	’ asked Miss Squeers with dignity . ‘
245654	245655	245656	245657	My pa	10382	’ ‘
245659	245664	245666	245666	he	10382	’ repeated Miss Squeers ; ‘

245726	245731	245725	245725	miss	8981	’ replied the waiter . ‘
245742	245800	245803	245803	he	10382	’ MAY BE . Very pretty this , indeed ! Here was Miss Squeers , who had been depending , all the way to London , upon showing her friends how much at home she would be , and how much respectful notice her name and connections would excite , told that her father MIGHT be there ! ‘
245808	245817	245803	245803	he	10382	’ observed Miss Squeers , with emphatic indignation . ‘
245824	245829	245803	245803	he	10382	’ said John Browdie . ‘
245831	245840	245803	245803	he	10382	’ hond up another pigeon - pie , will ‘
245847	245861	245863	245863	he	10382	’ muttered John , looking into the empty dish as the waiter retired ; ‘

245912	245996	245902	245902	I	0	’ After a short interval , which John Browdie employed upon the ham and a cold round of beef , the waiter returned with another pie , and the information that Mr. Squeers was not stopping in the house , but that he came there every day and that directly he arrived , he should be shown upstairs . With this , he retired ; and he had not retired two minutes , when he returned with Mr. Squeers and his hopeful son . ‘
246006	246027	246032	246032	pa	11468	’ said Mr. Squeers , when he had saluted the party and received some private family intelligence from his daughter . ‘
246034	246042	246032	246032	pa	11468	’ replied that young lady , spitefully . ‘

246091	246095	246083	246084	young men	12324	’ returned Squeers ; ‘
246137	246146	246132	246132	They	12324	’ said Mr. Squeers in a moralising way , ‘
246149	246159	246132	246132	They	12324	’re aware of it ; mine did upon me . ’
246160	246162	246132	246132	They	12324	‘ Will ‘
246168	246172	246132	246132	They	12324	’ said John . ‘

246281	246296	246274	246274	Squeers	203	‘ it ’s your turn to be married next . You must make haste . ’
246297	246301	246340	246340	her	282	‘ Oh , I ’m
246306	246314	246274	246274	Squeers	203	’ said Miss Squeers , very sharply . ‘
246319	246328	246317	246317	Fanny	282	’ cried her old friend with some archness . ‘
246331	246334	246336	246337	Miss Squeers	282	‘ Tilda , ’
246344	246349	246340	246340	her	282	‘ I can wait . ’
246350	246362	246364	246365	Mrs. Browdie	505	‘ So can the young men , it seems , Fanny , ’
246367	246376	246364	246365	Mrs. Browdie	505	‘ They an’t draw’d into it by ME , ‘
246379	246384	246377	246377	Tilda	284	’ retorted Miss Squeers . ‘
246387	246392	246340	246340	her	282	’ returned her friend ; ‘
246398	246497	246500	246500	you	5519	’ The sarcastic tone of this reply might have provoked a rather acrimonious retort from Miss Squeers , who , besides being of a constitutionally vicious temper -- aggravated , just now , by travel and recent jolting -- was somewhat irritated by old recollections and the failure of her own designs upon Mr. Browdie ; and the acrimonious retort might have led to a great many other retorts , which might have led to Heaven knows what , if the subject of conversation had not been , at that precise moment , accidentally changed by Mr. Squeers himself ‘
246503	246508	246500	246500	you	5519	’ said that gentleman ; ‘

246530	246551	246528	246528	Mr--	509	’ Miss Squeers was unable to finish the sentence , but Mrs Browdie did it for her , and added , ‘

246558	246562	246552	246552	Nickleby	207	’ said Squeers . ‘

246578	246587	246576	246576	Smike	264	’ cried Miss Squeers , clapping her hands . ‘

246720	246742	246697	246697	I	0	’ replied Squeers , staggering in his chair under the congratulatory blow on the chest which the stout Yorkshireman dealt him ; ‘
246779	246780	246767	246767	he	5528	’ ‘
246783	246788	246767	246767	he	5528	’ repeated John Browdie . ‘

246812	246820	246803	246803	I	0	’ said Squeers , rubbing his hands . ‘

246838	246848	246803	246803	I	0	’ inquired John , sitting down close to him . ‘
246861	246924	246927	246927	he	5528	’ Although he could not keep pace with John Browdie ’s impatience , Mr Squeers related the lucky chance by which Smike had fallen into his hands , as quickly as he could , and , except when he was interrupted by the admiring remarks of his auditors , paused not in the recital until he had brought it to an end . ‘
246938	246951	246927	246927	he	5528	’ observed Squeers , when he had finished , looking very cunning , ‘
247032	247033	247066	247066	you	5533	’ ‘
247039	247050	247066	247066	you	5533	’ returned the Yorkshireman , shaking him by the hand . ‘
247061	247062	247066	247066	you	5533	’ ‘
247069	247251	247252	247252	Tilda	284	’ returned Mr. Squeers , who had not expected quite such a ready acceptance of his invitation , or he would have considered twice before he gave it . John Browdie ’s only reply was another squeeze of the hand , and an assurance that they would not begin to see London till tomorrow , so that they might be at Mr. Snawley ’s at six o’clock without fail ; and after some further conversation , Mr. Squeers and his son departed . During the remainder of the day , Mr. Browdie was in a very odd and excitable state ; bursting occasionally into an explosion of laughter , and then taking up his hat and running into the coach - yard to have it out by himself . He was very restless too , constantly walking in and out , and snapping his fingers , and dancing scraps of uncouth country dances , and , in short , conducting himself in such a very extraordinary manner , that Miss Squeers opined he was going mad , and , begging her dear ‘
247631	247644	247646	247647	the Yorkshireman	9742	‘ Ods - bobs , dost thee not know me , mun ? ’
247653	247665	247646	247647	the Yorkshireman	9742	‘ Browdie . Chap as met thee efther schoolmeasther was banged ? ’

247682	247686	247688	247688	John	505	‘ Help thee ! ’

247806	247812	247814	247814	God	225	’ said John , sadly , ‘

247828	247842	247843	247843	Stan	511	’ Smike opened his mouth to speak , but John Browdie stopped him . ‘

247865	247913	247862	247862	I	0	’ With this caution , John Browdie shook his head significantly , and drawing a screwdriver from his pocket , took off the box of the lock in a very deliberate and workmanlike manner , and laid it , together with the implement , on the floor . ‘
247917	247920	247862	247862	I	0	’ said John ‘

247987	248018	247985	247985	Mine	264	’ replied Smike , as the Yorkshireman hurried him to the adjoining room , and pointed out a pair of shoes and a coat which were lying on a chair . ‘
248021	248022	248070	248070	they	5555	’ ‘
248025	248051	248070	248070	they	5555	’ said John , forcing the wrong arm into the wrong sleeve , and winding the tails of the coat round the fugitive ’s neck . ‘
248076	248077	248070	248070	they	5555	’ ‘
248089	248099	248082	248082	he’ll	5556	’ replied Smike , trembling from head to foot . ‘

250601	250609	250611	250611	Nicholas	207	‘ A fine morning , Mr. Linkinwater ! ’

250624	250651	250622	250622	Tim	482	‘ talk of the country , indeed ! What do you think of this , now , for a day -- a London day -- eh ? ’

250685	250693	250695	250695	Nicholas	207	‘ You should see it from MINE , ’

250711	250719	250708	250709	Tim Linkinwater	482	‘ do n’t tell me . Country ! ’
250731	250803	250664	250664	Nicholas	207	‘ Nonsense ! What can you get in the country but new - laid eggs and flowers ? I can buy new - laid eggs in Leadenhall Market , any morning before breakfast ; and as to flowers , it ’s worth a run upstairs to smell my mignonette , or to see the double wallflower in the back - attic window , at No . 6 , in the court . ’
250804	250822	250824	250824	Nicholas	207	‘ There is a double wallflower at No . 6 , in the court , is there ? ’
250826	250832	250834	250834	Tim	482	‘ Yes , is there ! ’
250836	250871	250834	250834	Tim	482	‘ and planted in a cracked jug , without a spout . There were hyacinths there , this last spring , blossoming , in -- but you ’ll laugh at that , of course . ’
250872	250876	250889	250889	Tim	482	‘ At what ? ’
250877	250887	250889	250889	Tim	482	‘ At their blossoming in old blacking - bottles , ’
250891	250897	250899	250899	Nicholas	207	‘ Not I , indeed , ’
250956	250990	250992	250992	Tim	482	‘ They belong to a sickly bedridden hump - backed boy , and seem to be the only pleasure , Mr. Nickleby , of his sad existence . How many years is it , ’
250996	251059	251061	251061	Tim	482	‘ since I first noticed him , quite a little child , dragging himself about on a pair of tiny crutches ? Well ! Well ! Not many ; but though they would appear nothing , if I thought of other things , they seem a long , long time , when I think of him . It is a sad thing , ’
251066	251105	251061	251061	Tim	482	‘ to see a little deformed child sitting apart from other children , who are active and merry , watching the games he is denied the power to share in . He made my heart ache very often . ’
251106	251113	251115	251115	Nicholas	207	‘ It is a good heart , ’
251117	251137	251115	251115	Nicholas	207	‘ that disentangles itself from the close avocations of every day , to heed such things . You were saying-- ’
251138	251148	251150	251150	Tim	482	‘ That the flowers belonged to this poor boy , ’
251152	251281	251150	251150	Tim	482	‘ that ’s all . When it is fine weather , and he can crawl out of bed , he draws a chair close to the window , and sits there , looking at them and arranging them , all day long . He used to nod , at first , and then we came to speak . Formerly , when I called to him of a morning , and asked him how he was , he would smile , and say , “ Better ! ” but now he shakes his head , and only bends more closely over his old plants . It must be dull to watch the dark housetops and the flying clouds , for so many months ; but he is very patient . ’
251282	251295	251297	251297	Nicholas	207	‘ Is there nobody in the house to cheer or help him ? ’
251299	251308	251310	251310	Tim	482	‘ His father lives there , I believe , ’
251312	251521	251310	251310	Tim	482	‘ and other people too ; but no one seems to care much for the poor sickly cripple . I have asked him , very often , if I can do nothing for him ; his answer is always the same . “ Nothing . ” His voice is growing weak of late , but I can SEE that he makes the old reply . He ca n’t leave his bed now , so they have moved it close beside the window , and there he lies , all day : now looking at the sky , and now at his flowers , which he still makes shift to trim and water , with his own thin hands . At night , when he sees my candle , he draws back his curtain , and leaves it so , till I am in bed . It seems such company to him to know that I am there , that I often sit at my window for an hour or more , that he may see I am still awake ; and sometimes I get up in the night to look at the dull melancholy light in his little room , and wonder whether he is awake or sleeping . ‘
251530	251534	251310	251310	Tim	482	’ said Tim , ‘
251642	251651	251654	251654	you	5625	’ cried Tim , with a contemptuous emphasis ; ‘
251675	251818	251819	251819	I	0	’ With which inquiry , Tim turned his back , and pretending to be absorbed in his accounts , took an opportunity of hastily wiping his eyes when he supposed Nicholas was looking another way . Whether it was that Tim ’s accounts were more than usually intricate that morning , or whether it was that his habitual serenity had been a little disturbed by these recollections , it so happened that when Nicholas returned from executing some commission , and inquired whether Mr. Charles Cheeryble was alone in his room , Tim promptly , and without the smallest hesitation , replied in the affirmative , although somebody had passed into the room not ten minutes before , and Tim took especial and particular pride in preventing any intrusion on either of the brothers when they were engaged with any visitor whatever . ‘
251829	251833	251819	251819	I	0	’ said Nicholas , ‘
251840	251867	251868	251868	He	0	’ And with that , he walked to the room and knocked at the door . No answer . Another knock , and still no answer . ‘
251874	251878	251868	251868	He	0	’ thought Nicholas . ‘
251887	252093	251879	251879	I	0	’ So , Nicholas opened the door and walked in ; and very quickly he turned to walk out again , when he saw , to his great astonishment and discomfiture , a young lady upon her knees at Mr. Cheeryble ’s feet , and Mr Cheeryble beseeching her to rise , and entreating a third person , who had the appearance of the young lady ’s female attendant , to add her persuasions to his to induce her to do so . Nicholas stammered out an awkward apology , and was precipitately retiring , when the young lady , turning her head a little , presented to his view the features of the lovely girl whom he had seen at the register - office on his first visit long before . Glancing from her to the attendant , he recognised the same clumsy servant who had accompanied her then ; and between his admiration of the young lady ’s beauty , and the confusion and surprise of this unexpected recognition , he stood stock - still , in such a bewildered state of surprise and embarrassment that , for the moment , he was quite bereft of the power either to speak or move . ‘
252103	252111	252098	252101	my dear young lady	5630	’ cried brother Charles in violent agitation , ‘
252145	252165	252166	252166	She	5630	’ As he spoke , he raised the young lady , who staggered to a chair and swooned away . ‘
252172	252180	252170	252170	sir	714	’ said Nicholas , darting eagerly forward . ‘
252187	252191	252170	252170	sir	714	’ cried brother Charles ‘
252208	252209	252198	252198	Ned	484	’ ‘
252217	252227	252210	252211	Brother Charles	355	’ replied his brother , hurrying into the room , ‘
252235	252236	252198	252198	Ned	484	’ ‘
252249	252254	252246	252247	brother Ned	12823	’ returned the other . ‘
252293	252294	252286	252286	I	0	’ ‘
252302	252323	252295	252295	I	0	’ said Nicholas , who had been watching the patient so eagerly , that he had not heard the request . ‘
252327	252347	252295	252295	I	0	’ cried brother Charles , gently taking her hand in his , and laying her head upon his arm . ‘
252372	252570	252571	252571	I	0	’ here he was again reminded of the presence of Nicholas , and shaking him by the hand , earnestly requested him to leave the room , and to send Tim Linkinwater without an instant ’s delay . Nicholas immediately withdrew and , on his way to the counting - house , met both the old housekeeper and Tim Linkinwater , jostling each other in the passage , and hurrying to the scene of action with extraordinary speed . Without waiting to hear his message , Tim Linkinwater darted into the room , and presently afterwards Nicholas heard the door shut and locked on the inside . He had abundance of time to ruminate on this discovery , for Tim Linkinwater was absent during the greater part of an hour , during the whole of which time Nicholas thought of nothing but the young lady , and her exceeding beauty , and what could possibly have brought her there , and why they made such a mystery of it . The more he thought of all this , the more it perplexed him , and the more anxious he became to know who and what she was . ‘
252580	252654	252571	252571	I	0	’ thought Nicholas . And with that he walked up and down the room , and recalling her face and figure ( of which he had a peculiarly vivid remembrance ) , discarded all other subjects of reflection and dwelt upon that alone . At length Tim Linkinwater came back -- provokingly cool , and with papers in his hand , and a pen in his mouth , as if nothing had happened . ‘
252660	252666	252656	252656	she	5645	’ said Nicholas , impetuously . ‘
252669	252674	252656	252656	she	5645	’ returned Tim Linkinwater . ‘
252677	252681	252682	252684	The young lady	893	’ repeated Nicholas . ‘
252686	252687	252682	252684	The young lady	893	’ ‘
252696	252708	252690	252690	you	0	’ said Tim , taking his pen out of his mouth , ‘
252730	252731	252711	252711	you	0	’ ‘
252734	252738	252741	252741	you	0	’ returned Nicholas , ‘
252751	252752	252750	252750	you--	5647	’ ‘
252758	252768	252750	252750	you--	5647	’ said Tim Linkinwater , putting on his spectacles . ‘
252782	252783	252788	252788	she	5645	’ ‘
252790	252794	252788	252788	she	5645	’ returned Nicholas . ‘
252798	252805	252788	252788	she	5645	’ replied Mr. Linkinwater , gravely . ‘
252815	252819	252820	252820	She	5645	’ asked Nicholas . ‘
252824	252828	252820	252820	She	5645	’ said Tim . ‘
252831	252832	252820	252820	She	5645	’ ‘
252835	252836	252820	252820	She	5645	’ ‘
252846	252856	252837	252837	I	0	’ said Nicholas , looking earnestly at the other . ‘
252859	252865	252866	252866	I	0	’ replied the immovable Tim , ‘
252872	253206	252868	252868	she	5645	’ Nicholas hazarded one or two further remarks , but it was evident that Tim Linkinwater had his own reasons for evading the subject , and that he was determined to afford no further information respecting the fair unknown , who had awakened so much curiosity in the breast of his young friend . Nothing daunted by this repulse , Nicholas returned to the charge next day , emboldened by the circumstance of Mr. Linkinwater being in a very talkative and communicative mood ; but , directly he resumed the theme , Tim relapsed into a state of most provoking taciturnity , and from answering in monosyllables , came to returning no answers at all , save such as were to be inferred from several grave nods and shrugs , which only served to whet that appetite for intelligence in Nicholas , which had already attained a most unreasonable height . Foiled in these attempts , he was fain to content himself with watching for the young lady ’s next visit , but here again he was disappointed . Day after day passed , and she did not return . He looked eagerly at the superscription of all the notes and letters , but there was not one among them which he could fancy to be in her handwriting . On two or three occasions he was employed on business which took him to a distance , and had formerly been transacted by Tim Linkinwater . Nicholas could not help suspecting that , for some reason or other , he was sent out of the way on purpose , and that the young lady was there in his absence . Nothing transpired , however , to confirm this suspicion , and Tim could not be entrapped into any confession or admission tending to support it in the smallest degree . Mystery and disappointment are not absolutely indispensable to the growth of love , but they are , very often , its powerful auxiliaries . ‘
253215	254074	252868	252868	she	5645	’ is well enough as a proverb applicable to cases of friendship , though absence is not always necessary to hollowness of heart , even between friends , and truth and honesty , like precious stones , are perhaps most easily imitated at a distance , when the counterfeits often pass for real . Love , however , is very materially assisted by a warm and active imagination : which has a long memory , and will thrive , for a considerable time , on very slight and sparing food . Thus it is , that it often attains its most luxuriant growth in separation and under circumstances of the utmost difficulty ; and thus it was , that Nicholas , thinking of nothing but the unknown young lady , from day to day and from hour to hour , began , at last , to think that he was very desperately in love with her , and that never was such an ill - used and persecuted lover as he . Still , though he loved and languished after the most orthodox models , and was only deterred from making a confidante of Kate by the slight considerations of having never , in all his life , spoken to the object of his passion , and having never set eyes upon her , except on two occasions , on both of which she had come and gone like a flash of lightning -- or , as Nicholas himself said , in the numerous conversations he held with himself , like a vision of youth and beauty much too bright to last -- his ardour and devotion remained without its reward . The young lady appeared no more ; so there was a great deal of love wasted ( enough indeed to have set up half - a - dozen young gentlemen , as times go , with the utmost decency ) , and nobody was a bit the wiser for it ; not even Nicholas himself , who , on the contrary , became more dull , sentimental , and lackadaisical , every day . While matters were in this state , the failure of a correspondent of the brothers Cheeryble , in Germany , imposed upon Tim Linkinwater and Nicholas the necessity of going through some very long and complicated accounts , extending over a considerable space of time . To get through them with the greater dispatch , Tim Linkinwater proposed that they should remain at the counting - house , for a week or so , until ten o’clock at night ; to this , as nothing damped the zeal of Nicholas in the service of his kind patrons -- not even romance , which has seldom business habits -- he cheerfully assented . On the very first night of these later hours , at nine exactly , there came : not the young lady herself , but her servant , who , being closeted with brother Charles for some time , went away , and returned next night at the same hour , and on the next , and on the next again . These repeated visits inflamed the curiosity of Nicholas to the very highest pitch . Tantalised and excited , beyond all bearing , and unable to fathom the mystery without neglecting his duty , he confided the whole secret to Newman Noggs , imploring him to be on the watch next night ; to follow the girl home ; to set on foot such inquiries relative to the name , condition , and history of her mistress , as he could , without exciting suspicion ; and to report the result to him with the least possible delay . Beyond all measure proud of this commission , Newman Noggs took up his post , in the square , on the following evening , a full hour before the needful time , and planting himself behind the pump and pulling his hat over his eyes , began his watch with an elaborate appearance of mystery , admirably calculated to excite the suspicion of all beholders . Indeed , divers servant girls who came to draw water , and sundry little boys who stopped to drink at the ladle , were almost scared out of their senses , by the apparition of Newman Noggs looking stealthily round the pump , with nothing of him visible but his face , and that wearing the expression of a meditative Ogre . Punctual to her time , the messenger came again , and , after an interview of rather longer duration than usual , departed . Newman had made two appointments with Nicholas : one for the next evening , conditional on his success : and one the next night following , which was to be kept under all circumstances . The first night he was not at the place of meeting ( a certain tavern about half - way between the city and Golden Square ) , but on the second night he was there before Nicholas , and received him with open arms . ‘
254080	254084	252866	252866	I	0	’ whispered Newman . ‘
254107	254122	254100	254100	me	0	’ Nicholas needed no second invitation , and eagerly inquired what was the news . ‘
254131	254141	254100	254100	me	0	’ said Newman , in a flutter of exultation . ‘
254174	254175	254232	254232	Bobster	515	’ ‘
254178	254183	254232	254232	Bobster	515	’ said Nicholas eagerly . ‘
254186	254187	254232	254232	Bobster	515	’ ‘
254190	254194	254232	254232	Bobster	515	’ replied Newman . ‘
254199	254200	254232	254232	Bobster	515	’ ‘
254205	254209	254232	254232	Bobster	515	’ said Nicholas . ‘
254220	254221	254232	254232	Bobster	515	’ ‘
254227	254231	254232	254232	Bobster	515	’ replied Newman . ‘
254234	254240	254232	254232	Bobster	515	’ repeated Nicholas , indignantly . ‘
254246	254250	254251	254251	I	0	’ said Newman . ‘
254257	254258	254259	254259	Bobster	515	’ ‘
254261	254270	254259	254259	Bobster	515	’ repeated Nicholas , more emphatically than before . ‘
254279	254280	254274	254275	the servant	10006	’ ‘
254286	254297	254298	254300	Miss Cecilia Bobster	515	’ said Newman , shaking his head with great positiveness . ‘
254302	254303	254304	254304	Cecilia	515	’ ‘
254308	254332	254304	254304	Cecilia	515	’ returned Nicholas , muttering the two names together over and over again in every variety of tone , to try the effect . ‘
254341	254342	254335	254335	Cecilia	515	’ ‘
254351	254355	254346	254348	a pretty creature	11884	’ said Newman . ‘
254358	254362	254363	254364	Miss Bobster	515	’ said Nicholas . ‘
254366	254367	254363	254364	Miss Bobster	515	’ ‘
254376	254380	254372	254372	you	0	’ demanded Nicholas . ‘
254388	254398	254399	254399	I	0	’ retorted Noggs , clapping him on the shoulder . ‘
254415	254416	254409	254409	I	0	’ ‘
254421	254429	254431	254431	you	211	’ cried Nicholas , grasping his hand , ‘
254434	254435	254431	254431	you	211	’ ‘
254439	254443	254436	254436	I	0	’ replied Newman . ‘
254484	254485	254472	254472	She	515	’ ‘
254499	254507	254497	254497	Newman	211	’ said Nicholas , wringing his hand . ‘
254512	254516	254508	254508	You	0	’ returned Newman . ‘
254522	254526	254519	254519	she	515	’ cried Nicholas . ‘
254640	254679	254638	254638	you	211	’ Poor Noggs literally gasped for breath as this flood of questions rushed upon him , and moved spasmodically in his chair at every fresh inquiry , staring at Nicholas meanwhile with a most ludicrous expression of perplexity . ‘
254682	254686	254638	254638	you	211	’ said Newman , ‘
254694	254695	254687	254687	I	0	’ ‘
254702	254706	254699	254699	her	515	’ asked Nicholas . ‘
254715	254719	254699	254699	her	515	’ said Newman . ‘
254746	254747	254738	254738	I	0	’ ‘
254754	254763	254752	254752	Newman	211	’ replied Nicholas , with his characteristic vehemence . ‘
254769	254770	254771	254771	I	0	’ ‘
254787	254791	254776	254776	you	211	’ said Newman . ‘
254803	254807	254798	254798	she	515	’ asked Nicholas . ‘
254810	254814	254798	254798	she	515	’ said Newman . ‘
254824	255304	254821	254821	she	515	’ said Nicholas approvingly . Newman then went on to say , that the young lady was an only child , that her mother was dead , that she resided with her father , and that she had been induced to allow her lover a secret interview , at the intercession of her servant , who had great influence with her . He further related how it required much moving and great eloquence to bring the young lady to this pass ; how it was expressly understood that she merely afforded Nicholas an opportunity of declaring his passion ; and how she by no means pledged herself to be favourably impressed with his attentions . The mystery of her visits to the brothers Cheeryble remained wholly unexplained , for Newman had not alluded to them , either in his preliminary conversations with the servant or his subsequent interview with the mistress , merely remarking that he had been instructed to watch the girl home and plead his young friend ’s cause , and not saying how far he had followed her , or from what point . But Newman hinted that from what had fallen from the confidante , he had been led to suspect that the young lady led a very miserable and unhappy life , under the strict control of her only parent , who was of a violent and brutal temper ; a circumstance which he thought might in some degree account , both for her having sought the protection and friendship of the brothers , and her suffering herself to be prevailed upon to grant the promised interview . The last he held to be a very logical deduction from the premises , inasmuch as it was but natural to suppose that a young lady , whose present condition was so unenviable , would be more than commonly desirous to change it . It appeared , on further questioning -- for it was only by a very long and arduous process that all this could be got out of Newman Noggs -- that Newman , in explanation of his shabby appearance , had represented himself as being , for certain wise and indispensable purposes connected with that intrigue , in disguise ; and , being questioned how he had come to exceed his commission so far as to procure an interview , he responded , that the lady appearing willing to grant it , he considered himself bound , both in duty and gallantry , to avail himself of such a golden means of enabling Nicholas to prosecute his addresses . After these and all possible questions had been asked and answered twenty times over , they parted , undertaking to meet on the following night at half - past ten , for the purpose of fulfilling the appointment ; which was for eleven o’clock . ‘
255311	255320	255321	255321	I	0	’ thought Nicholas , as he walked home . ‘
255427	255460	255414	255415	a fool	1580	’ Still , Nicholas was dissatisfied ; and there was more in the dissatisfaction than mere revulsion of feeling . He was angry with the young lady for being so easily won , ‘
255463	255467	255473	255473	she	5661	’ reasoned Nicholas , ‘
255533	255544	255546	255546	Nicholas	207	‘ The fact is , she ’s a mystery altogether , ’
255760	255764	255766	255766	Newman	211	‘ Number twelve , ’
255768	255771	255773	255773	Nicholas	207	‘ Oh ! ’
255779	255783	255785	255785	Newman	211	‘ Good street ? ’
255787	255790	255785	255785	Newman	211	‘ Yes , ’
255794	255798	255799	255799	Newman	211	‘ Rather dull . ’
255922	255925	255927	255927	Nicholas	207	‘ Well ? ’
255935	255939	255941	255941	Newman	211	‘ All right , ’
255947	255964	255970	255970	he	0	‘ All ready ; nobody at home . Could n’t be better . Ha ! ha ! ’
255990	255993	255970	255970	he	0	‘ BOBSTER , ’
256020	256025	256027	256027	Nicholas	207	‘ What the devil ! ’
256032	256049	256027	256027	Nicholas	207	‘ Are we to sneak into the kitchen , as if we came after the forks ? ’
256050	256053	256055	256055	Newman	211	‘ Hush ! ’
256057	256067	256068	256068	em	5674	‘ Old Bobster -- ferocious Turk . He ’d kill ‘
256083	256084	256078	256078	he	0	’ ‘
256087	256095	256097	256097	you	211	’ cried Nicholas , in high wrath , ‘
256114	256239	256097	256097	you	211	’ He had no time to sing the praises of his mistress , just then , for Newman gave him a gentle push which had nearly precipitated him to the bottom of the area steps . Thinking it best to take the hint in good part , Nicholas descended , without further remonstrance , but with a countenance bespeaking anything rather than the hope and rapture of a passionate lover . Newman followed -- he would have followed head first , but for the timely assistance of Nicholas -- and , taking his hand , led him through a stone passage , profoundly dark , into a back - kitchen or cellar , of the blackest and most pitchy obscurity , where they stopped . ‘
256242	256251	256097	256097	you	211	’ said Nicholas , in a discontented whisper , ‘
256263	256264	256257	256257	I	0	’ ‘
256269	256273	256257	256257	I	0	’ rejoined Noggs ; ‘
256285	256286	256287	256287	I	0	’ ‘
256294	256298	256287	256287	I	0	’ said Nicholas . ‘
256309	256379	256306	256306	I	0	’ They exchanged no further words , and there Nicholas stood , listening to the loud breathing of Newman Noggs , and imagining that his nose seemed to glow like a red - hot coal , even in the midst of the darkness which enshrouded them . Suddenly the sound of cautious footsteps attracted his ear , and directly afterwards a female voice inquired if the gentleman was there . ‘
256382	256396	256306	256306	I	0	’ replied Nicholas , turning towards the corner from which the voice proceeded . ‘
256401	256402	256404	256404	me	0	’ ‘
256408	256413	256406	256406	sir	714	’ replied the voice . ‘
256421	256553	256416	256416	you	714	’ A gleam of light shone into the place , and presently the servant girl appeared , bearing a light , and followed by her young mistress , who seemed to be overwhelmed by modesty and confusion . At sight of the young lady , Nicholas started and changed colour ; his heart beat violently , and he stood rooted to the spot . At that instant , and almost simultaneously with her arrival and that of the candle , there was heard a loud and furious knocking at the street - door , which caused Newman Noggs to jump up , with great agility , from a beer - barrel on which he had been seated astride , and to exclaim abruptly , and with a face of ashy paleness , ‘
256560	256633	256557	256558	the Lord	1669	’ The young lady shrieked , the attendant wrung her hands , Nicholas gazed from one to the other in apparent stupefaction , and Newman hurried to and fro , thrusting his hands into all his pockets successively , and drawing out the linings of every one in the excess of his irresolution . It was but a moment , but the confusion crowded into that one moment no imagination can exaggerate . ‘
256653	256659	256699	256699	you	5684	’ cried the young lady . ‘
256673	256674	256699	256699	you	5684	’ ‘
256684	256688	256678	256678	me	0	’ cried Nicholas . ‘
256712	256766	256699	256699	you	5684	’ But Nicholas might as well have spoken to the wind , for the young lady , with distracted looks , hurried up the stairs . He would have followed her , but Newman , twisting his hand in his coat collar , dragged him towards the passage by which they had entered . ‘
256779	256783	256771	256771	Newman	211	’ cried Nicholas . ‘
256801	256802	256793	256793	I	0	’ ‘
256811	256827	256829	256829	them	5686	’ said Newman , clinging round him with both arms , and hurrying him away . ‘
256854	256945	256829	256829	them	5686	’ Overpowered by the remonstrances of Newman , and the tears and prayers of the girl , and the tremendous knocking above , which had never ceased , Nicholas allowed himself to be hurried off ; and , precisely as Mr. Bobster made his entrance by the street - door , he and Noggs made their exit by the area - gate . They hurried away , through several streets , without stopping or speaking . At last , they halted and confronted each other with blank and rueful faces . ‘
256949	256957	256829	256829	them	5686	’ said Newman , gasping for breath . ‘
256985	256986	256980	256980	I	0	’ ‘
256989	256997	256980	256980	I	0	’ replied Nicholas , taking his hand . ‘
257037	257038	257033	257035	THE WRONG LADY	5691	’ ‘
257041	257046	257033	257035	THE WRONG LADY	5691	’ cried Newman Noggs . ‘
257053	257054	257050	257051	the servant	10006	’ ‘
257059	257070	257057	257057	Newman	211	’ said Nicholas , laying his hand upon his shoulder : ‘
257078	257104	257073	257075	the wrong servant	5693	’ Newman ’s under - jaw dropped , and he gazed at Nicholas , with his sound eye fixed fast and motionless in his head . ‘
257112	257116	257073	257075	the wrong servant	5693	’ said Nicholas ; ‘
257142	257702	257134	257136	the wrong person	5694	’ That WAS all . Whether Newman Noggs had looked round the pump , in a slanting direction , so long , that his sight became impaired ; or whether , finding that there was time to spare , he had recruited himself with a few drops of something stronger than the pump could yield -- by whatsoever means it had come to pass , this was his mistake . And Nicholas went home to brood upon it , and to meditate upon the charms of the unknown young lady , now as far beyond his reach as ever . CHAPTER 41 Containing some Romantic Passages between Mrs. Nickleby and the Gentleman in the Small - clothes next Door Ever since her last momentous conversation with her son , Mrs. Nickleby had begun to display unusual care in the adornment of her person , gradually superadding to those staid and matronly habiliments , which had , up to that time , formed her ordinary attire , a variety of embellishments and decorations , slight perhaps in themselves , but , taken together , and considered with reference to the subject of her disclosure , of no mean importance . Even her black dress assumed something of a deadly - lively air from the jaunty style in which it was worn ; and , eked out as its lingering attractions were ; by a prudent disposal , here and there , of certain juvenile ornaments of little or no value , which had , for that reason alone , escaped the general wreck and been permitted to slumber peacefully in odd corners of old drawers and boxes where daylight seldom shone , her mourning garments assumed quite a new character . From being the outward tokens of respect and sorrow for the dead , they became converted into signals of very slaughterous and killing designs upon the living . Mrs. Nickleby might have been stimulated to this proceeding by a lofty sense of duty , and impulses of unquestionable excellence . She might , by this time , have become impressed with the sinfulness of long indulgence in unavailing woe , or the necessity of setting a proper example of neatness and decorum to her blooming daughter . Considerations of duty and responsibility apart , the change might have taken its rise in feelings of the purest and most disinterested charity . The gentleman next door had been vilified by Nicholas ; rudely stigmatised as a dotard and an idiot ; and for these attacks upon his understanding , Mrs. Nickleby was , in some sort , accountable . She might have felt that it was the act of a good Christian to show by all means in her power , that the abused gentleman was neither the one nor the other . And what better means could she adopt , towards so virtuous and laudable an end , than proving to all men , in her own person , that his passion was the most rational and reasonable in the world , and just the very result , of all others , which discreet and thinking persons might have foreseen , from her incautiously displaying her matured charms , without reserve , under the very eye , as it were , of an ardent and too - susceptible man ? ‘
257705	257715	257134	257136	the wrong person	5694	’ said Mrs. Nickleby , gravely shaking her head ; ‘
257791	257866	257867	257867	Kate	210	’ Whether the deceased might not have been better off if he had emigrated in his bachelor days , was a question which his relict did not stop to consider ; for Kate entered the room , with her workbox , in this stage of her reflections ; and a much slighter interruption , or no interruption at all , would have diverted Mrs. Nickleby ’s thoughts into a new channel at any time . ‘
257872	257877	257867	257867	Kate	210	’ said Mrs. Nickleby ; ‘
257922	257923	257936	257936	mama	9827	’ ‘
257938	257939	257936	257936	mama	9827	’ ‘
257952	257957	257947	257947	I	0	’ replied Mrs. Nickleby . ‘
258281	258282	258274	258274	you	5718	’ ‘
258296	258305	258294	258294	mama	9827	’ returned Kate , with a cheerful smile . ‘
258316	258339	258310	258310	you	5718	’ said Mrs. Nickleby , with as much gravity as if it were a question of the most imminent and thrilling interest . ‘
258384	258453	258456	258456	I	0	’ Kate laughingly replied that she was quite convinced ; and as her mama still appeared undetermined whether it was not absolutely essential that the subject should be renewed , proposed that they should take their work into the summer - house , and enjoy the beauty of the afternoon . Mrs. Nickleby readily assented , and to the summer - house they repaired , without further discussion . ‘
258460	258471	258456	258456	I	0	’ observed Mrs. Nickleby , as she took her seat , ‘
258543	258544	258545	258546	Dear mama	11206	’ ‘
258548	258554	258545	258546	Dear mama	11206	’ returned Kate , hastily , ‘
258567	258568	258565	258565	mama	9827	’ ‘
258583	258588	258576	258576	I	0	’ said Mrs. Nickleby . ‘
258594	258600	258591	258591	I	0	’ Kate looked up inquiringly . ‘
258607	258612	258602	258602	he	264	’ said Mrs. Nickleby , ‘
258698	258708	258693	258693	I	0	’ added Mrs. Nickleby , looking narrowly about her , ‘
258783	258784	258785	258785	Mama	357	’ ‘
258787	258803	258785	258785	Mama	357	’ said Kate , bending over her work so that her face was almost hidden , ‘
258808	258809	258785	258785	Mama	357	’ ‘
258815	258820	258813	258813	Kate	210	’ interrupted Mrs. Nickleby , ‘
258842	258867	258785	258785	Mama	357	’m talking to you about his thoughtfulness and attention to me ? You do n’t seem to take the smallest interest in the garden . ’
258868	258873	258875	258875	Kate	210	‘ Oh ! mama , ’
258882	258888	258875	258875	Kate	210	‘ you know I do . ’
258889	258911	258913	258914	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ Well then , my dear , why do n’t you praise the neatness and prettiness with which it ’s kept ? ’
258916	258925	258913	258914	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ How very odd you are , Kate ! ’
258926	258934	258936	258936	Kate	210	‘ I do praise it , mama , ’
258940	258944	258936	258936	Kate	210	‘ Poor fellow ! ’
258945	258955	258957	258958	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ I scarcely ever hear you , my dear , ’
258960	258970	258957	258958	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ that ’s all I ’ve got to say . ’
259013	259019	259021	259021	Kate	210	‘ About what , mama ? ’
259031	259039	259021	259021	Kate	210	‘ Lor , Kate , my dear , ’
259044	259048	259021	259021	Kate	210	‘ why , you ’re
259061	259062	259021	259021	Kate	210	’ ‘
259066	259070	259021	259021	Kate	210	’ said Kate , ‘
259092	259093	259094	259094	Suitors	5734	’ ‘
259099	259111	259094	259094	Suitors	5734	’ cried Mrs. Nickleby , with a smile of wonderful complacency . ‘
259127	259128	259129	259129	Mama	357	’ ‘
259131	259141	259142	259142	I	0	’ returned Kate , in a tone of remonstrance . ‘
259149	259154	259142	259142	I	0	’ said Mrs. Nickleby ; ‘
259269	259293	259266	259267	young Lukin	521	’ said Mrs. Nickleby , beginning with her left thumb and checking off the names on her fingers--‘Mogley -- Tipslark -- Cabbery -- Smifser-- ’
259316	259319	259336	259336	herself	207	‘ Hem ! ’
259344	259351	259353	259353	Kate	210	‘ Mama ! what was that ? ’
259362	259370	259353	259353	Kate	210	‘ Upon my word , my dear , ’
259378	259398	259372	259373	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ unless it was the gentleman belonging to the next house , I do n’t know what it could possibly-- ’
259399	259404	259336	259336	herself	207	‘ A -- hem ! ’
259461	259470	259472	259473	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ I understand it now , my dear , ’
259482	259522	259476	259476	her	207	‘ do n’t be alarmed , my love , it ’s not directed to you , and is not intended to frighten anybody . Let us give everybody their due , Kate ; I am bound to say that . ’
259576	259584	259586	259586	Kate	210	‘ What do you mean , mama ? ’
259592	259601	259603	259604	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ Do n’t be flurried , my dear , ’
259613	259618	259603	259604	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ for you see I ’m
259658	259659	259652	259652	Kate	210	’ ‘
259670	259674	259668	259668	mama	9827	’ said Kate . ‘
259689	259709	259668	259668	mama	9827	’ rejoined Mrs. Nickleby , drawing herself up , and patting her daughter ’s hand more blandly than before , ‘
259732	260071	260072	260072	Mama	357	’ Kate looked very much perplexed , and was apparently about to ask for further explanation , when a shouting and scuffling noise , as of an elderly gentleman whooping , and kicking up his legs on loose gravel , with great violence , was heard to proceed from the same direction as the former sounds ; and before they had subsided , a large cucumber was seen to shoot up in the air with the velocity of a sky - rocket , whence it descended , tumbling over and over , until it fell at Mrs. Nickleby ’s feet . This remarkable appearance was succeeded by another of a precisely similar description ; then a fine vegetable marrow , of unusually large dimensions , was seen to whirl aloft , and come toppling down ; then , several cucumbers shot up together ; and , finally , the air was darkened by a shower of onions , turnip - radishes , and other small vegetables , which fell rolling and scattering , and bumping about , in all directions . As Kate rose from her seat , in some alarm , and caught her mother ’s hand to run with her into the house , she felt herself rather retarded than assisted in her intention ; and following the direction of Mrs. Nickleby ’s eyes , was quite terrified by the apparition of an old black velvet cap , which , by slow degrees , as if its wearer were ascending a ladder or pair of steps , rose above the wall dividing their garden from that of the next cottage , ( which , like their own , was a detached building , ) and was gradually followed by a very large head , and an old face , in which were a pair of most extraordinary grey eyes : very wild , very wide open , and rolling in their sockets , with a dull , languishing , leering look , most ugly to behold . ‘
260074	260084	260072	260072	Mama	357	’ cried Kate , really terrified for the moment , ‘
260103	260104	260105	260105	Kate	210	’ ‘
260110	260119	260105	260105	Kate	210	’ returned her mother , still holding back , ‘
260128	260147	260105	260105	Kate	210	’m ashamed of you . How do you suppose you are ever to get through life , if you ’re
260161	260176	260156	260156	you	210	’ said Mrs. Nickleby , addressing the intruder with a sort of simpering displeasure . ‘
260185	260186	260179	260179	you	210	’ ‘
260192	260202	260179	260179	you	210	’ replied the stranger , folding his hands together , ‘
260207	260208	260179	260179	you	210	’ ‘
260213	260218	260211	260211	sir	714	’ said Mrs. Nickleby . ‘
260228	260229	260219	260219	Kate	210	’ ‘
260237	260258	260232	260232	you	210	’ urged the stranger , with his head imploringly on one side , and his right hand on his breast . ‘
260266	260267	260232	260232	you	210	’ ‘
260281	260286	260279	260279	sir	714	’ said Mrs Nickleby . ‘
260291	260292	260279	260279	sir	714	’ ‘
260297	260330	260219	260219	Kate	210	’ said the old gentleman , coming up a step higher , and leaning his elbows on the wall , with as much complacency as if he were looking out of window , ‘
260351	260366	260219	260219	Kate	210	’ Here he smiled , kissed his hand , and made several low bows . ‘
260415	260427	260478	260478	him	5770	’ he added , dropping his voice almost to a whisper , ‘
260466	260467	260478	260478	him	5770	’ ‘
260470	260474	260478	260478	him	5770	’ murmured Kate , ‘
260480	260481	260478	260478	him	5770	’ ‘
260487	260499	260500	260500	he	5770	’ replied Mrs. Nickleby , in the same tone of voice , ‘
260537	260538	260535	260535	sir	714	’ ‘
260542	260552	260535	260535	sir	714	’ said the gentleman , with a languishing look . ‘
260558	260559	260535	260535	sir	714	’ ‘
260562	260567	260535	260535	sir	714	’ returned Mrs. Nickleby , ‘
260589	260590	260591	260591	I	0	’ ‘
260595	260617	260591	260591	I	0	’ said the old gentleman , laying his finger on his nose , with an air of familiarity , most reprehensible , ‘
260643	260710	260716	260717	Mrs. Nickleby	207	’ gardens , and force the fruit and vegetables into premature existence . That fact I am acquainted with . But will you permit me , fairest creature , to ask you one question , in the absence of the planet Venus , who has gone on business to the Horse Guards , and would otherwise -- jealous of your superior charms -- interpose between us ? ’
260711	260714	260716	260717	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ Kate , ’
260724	260753	260716	260717	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ it ’s very awkward , positively . I really do n’t know what to say to this gentleman . One ought to be civil , you know . ’
260754	260758	260760	260760	Kate	210	‘ Dear mama , ’
260762	260791	260760	260760	Kate	210	‘ do n’t say a word to him , but let us run away as fast as we can , and shut ourselves up till Nicholas comes home . ’
260829	260892	260812	260814	the old gentleman	8480	‘ If you will conduct yourself , sir , like the gentleman I should imagine you to be , from your language and -- and -- appearance , ( quite the counterpart of your grandpapa , Kate , my dear , in his best days , ) and will put your question to me in plain words , I will answer it . ’
261031	261035	261004	261004	he	5782	‘ The question is-- ’
261101	261107	261092	261092	his	5782	‘ Are you a princess ? ’
261108	261116	261118	261119	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ You are mocking me , sir , ’
261130	261137	261139	261141	the old gentleman	8480	‘ No , but are you ? ’
261143	261152	261154	261155	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ You know I am not , sir , ’
261157	261169	261171	261173	the old gentleman	8480	‘ Then are you any relation to the Archbishop of Canterbury ? ’
261178	261242	261171	261173	the old gentleman	8480	‘ or to the Pope of Rome ? Or the Speaker of the House of Commons ? Forgive me , if I am wrong , but I was told you were niece to the Commissioners of Paving , and daughter - in - law to the Lord Mayor and Court of Common Council , which would account for your relationship to all three . ’
261243	261252	261254	261255	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ Whoever has spread such reports , sir , ’
261261	261297	261299	261300	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ has taken great liberties with my name , and one which I am sure my son Nicholas , if he was aware of it , would not allow for an instant . The idea ! ’
261306	261314	261299	261300	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ niece to the Commissioners of Paving ! ’
261315	261323	261325	261325	Kate	210	‘ Pray , mama , come away ! ’
261327	261337	261339	261340	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ “ Pray mama ! ” Nonsense , Kate , ’
261344	261375	261377	261378	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ but that ’s just the way . If they had said I was niece to a piping bullfinch , what would you care ? But I have no sympathy , ’
261380	261392	261377	261378	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ I do n’t expect it , that ’s one thing . ’
261393	261396	261409	261409	he	5789	‘ Tears ! ’
261424	261431	261409	261409	he	5789	‘ Catch the crystal globules -- catch ‘
261435	261440	261377	261378	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ em up -- cork ‘

261465	261487	261506	261506	he	5789	‘ em away in the fourteen binn , with a bar of iron on the top to keep the thunder off ! ’
261583	261587	261590	261590	his	5789	‘ Beautiful madam , ’
261593	261715	261590	261590	his	5789	‘ if I have made any mistake with regard to your family or connections , I humbly beseech you to pardon me . If I supposed you to be related to Foreign Powers or Native Boards , it is because you have a manner , a carriage , a dignity , which you will excuse my saying that none but yourself ( with the single exception perhaps of the tragic muse , when playing extemporaneously on the barrel organ before the East India Company ) can parallel . I am not a youth , ma’am , as you see ; and although beings like you can never grow old , I venture to presume that we are fitted for each other . ’
261716	261724	261726	261727	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ Really , Kate , my love ! ’
261735	261742	261744	261746	the old gentleman	8480	‘ I have estates , ma’am , ’
261769	261889	261890	261890	he	8480	‘ jewels , lighthouses , fish - ponds , a whalery of my own in the North Sea , and several oyster - beds of great profit in the Pacific Ocean . If you will have the kindness to step down to the Royal Exchange and to take the cocked - hat off the stoutest beadle ’s head , you will find my card in the lining of the crown , wrapped up in a piece of blue paper . My walking - stick is also to be seen on application to the chaplain of the House of Commons , who is strictly forbidden to take any money for showing it . I have enemies about me , ma’am , ’
261900	261988	261890	261890	he	8480	‘ who attack me on all occasions , and wish to secure my property . If you bless me with your hand and heart , you can apply to the Lord Chancellor or call out the military if necessary -- sending my toothpick to the commander - in - chief will be sufficient -- and so clear the house of them before the ceremony is performed .

As to my being young enough to marry again , that perhaps may be so , or it may not be ; but I could n’t think of it for an instant , not on any account whatever . I said I never would , and I never will . It ’s a very painful thing to have to reject proposals , and I would much rather that none were made ; at the same time this is the answer that I determined long ago to make , and this is the answer I shall always give . ’

During this conversation , Mrs. Nickleby had regarded the man with a severe and steadfast look . She now heaved a profound sigh , and pursing up her lips , shook her head in a slow and doubtful manner . ‘

266631	266670	266628	266629	his wife	648	‘ that it was in consequence of her being here , that John wrote to you and fixed tonight , because we thought that it would n’t be pleasant for you to meet , after what has passed . ’

How very clever it was in you , ma’am , to choose a time when I had gone to tea with my pa , and was sure not to come back without being fetched !

268107	268126	268105	268105	Tilda	284	’ said Miss Squeers , with such a sudden accession of violence that John started in his boots , ‘
268148	268157	268105	268105	Tilda	284	’ cried Miss Squeers in a solemn voice , ‘
268162	268173	268105	268105	Tilda	284	‘ Tilda , not to save it from its grave . ’

268183	268187	268105	268105	Tilda	284	’ observed John , ‘

268383	268388	268378	268378	I	0	’ resumed Mrs. Browdie , ‘
268467	268502	268459	268459	you	282	’ Miss Squeers made no more direct reply than surveying her former friend from top to toe , and elevating her nose in the air with ineffable disdain . But some indistinct allusions to a ‘
268505	268508	268459	268459	you	282	’ and a ‘
268511	268514	268459	268459	you	282	’ and a ‘
268518	268803	268459	268459	you	282	’ escaped her ; and this , together with a severe biting of the lips , great difficulty in swallowing , and very frequent comings and goings of breath , seemed to imply that feelings were swelling in Miss Squeers ’s bosom too great for utterance . While the foregoing conversation was proceeding , Master Wackford , finding himself unnoticed , and feeling his preponderating inclinations strong upon him , had by little and little sidled up to the table and attacked the food with such slight skirmishing as drawing his fingers round and round the inside of the plates , and afterwards sucking them with infinite relish ; picking the bread , and dragging the pieces over the surface of the butter ; pocketing lumps of sugar , pretending all the time to be absorbed in thought ; and so forth . Finding that no interference was attempted with these small liberties , he gradually mounted to greater , and , after helping himself to a moderately good cold collation , was , by this time , deep in the pie . Nothing of this had been unobserved by Mr. Squeers , who , so long as the attention of the company was fixed upon other objects , hugged himself to think that his son and heir should be fattening at the enemy ’s expense . But there being now an appearance of a temporary calm , in which the proceedings of little Wackford could scarcely fail to be observed , he feigned to be aware of the circumstance for the first time , and inflicted upon the face of that young gentleman a slap that made the very tea - cups ring . ‘

269402	269438	269355	269355	I	0	’ said Squeers , turning round and addressing Nicholas , who , as he had caused him to smart pretty soundly on a former occasion , purposely abstained from taking any part in the discussion , ‘

269523	269528	269530	269530	Squeers	203	‘ Ai n’t you ! ’
269537	269544	269530	269530	Squeers	203	‘ Now then , come along . ’
269545	269558	269560	269561	Miss Squeers	282	‘ I leave such society , with my pa , for Hever , ’

269615	269726	269560	269561	Miss Squeers	282	’ With this sudden relapse into the sternest and most majestic wrath , Miss Squeers swept from the room ; and having sustained her dignity until the last possible moment , was heard to sob and scream and struggle in the passage . John Browdie remained standing behind the table , looking from his wife to Nicholas , and back again , with his mouth wide open , until his hand accidentally fell upon the tankard of ale , when he took it up , and having obscured his features therewith for some time , drew a long breath , handed it over to Nicholas , and rang the bell . ‘
269731	269737	269560	269561	Miss Squeers	282	’ said John , briskly . ‘

This turmoil , instead of quickly subsiding after the first outburst , ( as turmoils not unfrequently do , whether in taverns , legislative assemblies , or elsewhere , ) into a mere grumbling and growling squabble , increased every moment ; and although the whole din appeared to be raised by but one pair of lungs , yet that one pair was of so powerful a quality , and repeated such words as ‘
270138	270139	270136	270145	scoundrel , ’ ‘ rascal , ’ ‘ insolent puppy	5961	’ ‘
270142	270143	270136	270145	scoundrel , ’ ‘ rascal , ’ ‘ insolent puppy	5961	’ ‘
270147	270193	270136	270145	scoundrel , ’ ‘ rascal , ’ ‘ insolent puppy	5961	’ and a variety of expletives no less flattering to the party addressed , with such great relish and strength of tone , that a dozen voices raised in concert under any ordinary circumstances would have made far less uproar and created much smaller consternation . ‘
270201	270640	270641	270641	Hallo	527	’ said Nicholas , moving hastily towards the door . John Browdie was striding in the same direction when Mrs. Browdie turned pale , and , leaning back in her chair , requested him with a faint voice to take notice , that if he ran into any danger it was her intention to fall into hysterics immediately , and that the consequences might be more serious than he thought for . John looked rather disconcerted by this intelligence , though there was a lurking grin on his face at the same time ; but , being quite unable to keep out of the fray , he compromised the matter by tucking his wife ’s arm under his own , and , thus accompanied , following Nicholas downstairs with all speed . The passage outside the coffee - room door was the scene of disturbance , and here were congregated the coffee - room customers and waiters , together with two or three coachmen and helpers from the yard . These had hastily assembled round a young man who from his appearance might have been a year or two older than Nicholas , and who , besides having given utterance to the defiances just now described , seemed to have proceeded to even greater lengths in his indignation , inasmuch as his feet had no other covering than a pair of stockings , while a couple of slippers lay at no great distance from the head of a prostrate figure in an opposite corner , who bore the appearance of having been shot into his present retreat by means of a kick , and complimented by having the slippers flung about his ears afterwards . The coffee - room customers , and the waiters , and the coachmen , and the helpers -- not to mention a barmaid who was looking on from behind an open sash window -- seemed at that moment , if a spectator might judge from their winks , nods , and muttered exclamations , strongly disposed to take part against the young gentleman in the stockings . Observing this , and that the young gentleman was nearly of his own age and had in nothing the appearance of an habitual brawler , Nicholas , impelled by such feelings as will influence young men sometimes , felt a very strong disposition to side with the weaker party , and so thrust himself at once into the centre of the group , and in a more emphatic tone , perhaps , than circumstances might seem to warrant , demanded what all that noise was about . ‘
270643	270653	270641	270641	Hallo	527	’ said one of the men from the yard , ‘
270663	270664	270656	270658	somebody in disguise	5962	’ ‘
270678	270745	270676	270676	gen’l’men	5965	’ cried another fellow . Disregarding these sallies , which were uncommonly well received , as sallies at the expense of the best - dressed persons in a crowd usually are , Nicholas glanced carelessly round , and addressing the young gentleman , who had by this time picked up his slippers and thrust his feet into them , repeated his inquiries with a courteous air . ‘
270750	270773	270676	270676	gen’l’men	5965	’ he replied . At this a murmur was raised by the lookers - on , and some of the boldest cried , ‘
270797	270975	270786	270786	he	5966	’ These and many other expressions of ironical disapprobation having been exhausted , two or three of the out - of - door fellows began to hustle Nicholas and the young gentleman who had made the noise : stumbling against them by accident , and treading on their toes , and so forth . But this being a round game , and one not necessarily limited to three or four players , was open to John Browdie too , who , bursting into the little crowd -- to the great terror of his wife -- and falling about in all directions , now to the right , now to the left , now forwards , now backwards , and accidentally driving his elbow through the hat of the tallest helper , who had been particularly active , speedily caused the odds to wear a very different appearance ; while more than one stout fellow limped away to a respectful distance , anathematising with tears in his eyes the heavy tread and ponderous feet of the burly Yorkshireman . ‘
270984	271029	270977	270977	me	0	’ said he who had been kicked into the corner , rising as he spoke , apparently more from the fear of John Browdie ’s inadvertently treading upon him , than from any desire to place himself on equal terms with his late adversary . ‘
271042	271043	271031	271031	me	0	’ ‘
271053	271059	271047	271047	you	5967	’ said the young man , ‘
271078	271142	271067	271067	yours	5967	’ Here a waiter who had been rubbing his hands in excessive enjoyment of the scene , so long as only the breaking of heads was in question , adjured the spectators with great earnestness to fetch the police , declaring that otherwise murder would be surely done , and that he was responsible for all the glass and china on the premises . ‘
271151	271157	271158	271158	I	0	’ said the young gentleman , ‘
271186	271187	271190	271190	you	0	’ ‘
271195	271202	271190	271190	you	0	’ asked one of the bystanders . ‘
271212	271232	271207	271207	you	0	’ demanded the others . The unpopular gentleman looked coolly round , and addressing himself to Nicholas , said : ‘
271463	271480	271459	271459	I	0	’ said the young man , who had certainly not quite recovered from his recent heat ; ‘
271506	271656	271501	271501	I	0	’ Of all possible courses of proceeding under the circumstances detailed , there was certainly not one which , in his then state of mind , could have appeared more laudable to Nicholas than this . There were not many subjects of dispute which at that moment could have come home to his own breast more powerfully , for having the unknown uppermost in his thoughts , it naturally occurred to him that he would have done just the same if any audacious gossiper durst have presumed in his hearing to speak lightly of her . Influenced by these considerations , he espoused the young gentleman ’s quarrel with great warmth , protesting that he had done quite right , and that he respected him for it ; which John Browdie ( albeit not quite clear as to the merits ) immediately protested too , with not inferior vehemence . ‘
271666	271690	271691	271691	He	5982	’ said the defeated party , who was being rubbed down by a waiter , after his recent fall on the dusty boards . ‘
271730	271825	271826	271826	My	0	’ This reflection appeared to have great weight with the young lady in the bar , who ( adjusting her cap as she spoke , and glancing at a mirror ) declared that it would be a very pretty state of things indeed ; and that if people were to be punished for actions so innocent and natural as that , there would be more people to be knocked down than there would be people to knock them down , and that she wondered what the gentleman meant by it , that she did . ‘
271830	271846	271826	271826	My	0	’ said the young gentleman in a low voice , advancing towards the sash window . ‘
271851	271899	271849	271849	sir	714	’ replied the young lady sharply , smiling though as she turned aside , and biting her lip , ( whereat Mrs. Browdie , who was still standing on the stairs , glanced at her with disdain , and called to her husband to come away ) . ‘
271907	271913	271905	271905	me	0	’ said the young man . ‘
271972	271973	271965	271965	yours	9739	’ ‘
271981	271991	271965	271965	yours	9739	’ replied the young lady , tossing her head , ‘
271993	271994	271997	271997	I	0	’ ‘
272004	272022	272023	272023	I	0	’ said the young man , looking with an air of admiration in the barmaid ’s face ; ‘
272067	272168	272169	272169	I	0	’ The young lady interrupted the conversation at this point , by thrusting her head out of the bar - window , and inquiring of the waiter in a shrill voice whether that young man who had been knocked down was going to stand in the passage all night , or whether the entrance was to be left clear for other people . The waiters taking the hint , and communicating it to the hostlers , were not slow to change their tone too , and the result was , that the unfortunate victim was bundled out in a twinkling . ‘
272179	272183	272172	272172	I	0	’ said Nicholas . ‘
272186	272192	272193	272193	I	0	’ replied his new acquaintance . ‘
272199	272207	272193	272193	I	0	’ said Nicholas , pausing to reflect . ‘
272242	272254	272237	272237	I	0	’ It was , indeed , Tom , the ugly clerk . ‘
272260	272297	272237	272237	I	0	’ said Nicholas , ruminating upon the strange manner in which the register - office seemed to start up and stare him in the face every now and then , and when he least expected it . ‘
272318	272334	272298	272298	I	0	’ said the young man , laughing , and drawing a card from his pocket . ‘
272352	272374	272336	272336	you	0	’ Nicholas took the card , and glancing at it involuntarily as he returned the compliment , evinced very great surprise . ‘
272379	272383	272375	272377	Mr. Frank Cheeryble	481	’ said Nicholas . ‘
272397	272398	272399	272399	I	0	’ ‘
272411	272420	272399	272399	I	0	’ returned Mr. Frank , good - humouredly ; ‘
272476	272718	272472	272472	I	0	’ Nicholas responded to these compliments with others of the same kind , and they shook hands warmly . Then he introduced John Browdie , who had remained in a state of great admiration ever since the young lady in the bar had been so skilfully won over to the right side . Then Mrs. John Browdie was introduced , and finally they all went upstairs together and spent the next half - hour with great satisfaction and mutual entertainment ; Mrs. John Browdie beginning the conversation by declaring that of all the made - up things she ever saw , that young woman below - stairs was the vainest and the plainest . This Mr. Frank Cheeryble , although , to judge from what had recently taken place , a hot - headed young man ( which is not an absolute miracle and phenomenon in nature ) , was a sprightly , good - humoured , pleasant fellow , with much both in his countenance and disposition that reminded Nicholas very strongly of the kind - hearted brothers . His manner was as unaffected as theirs , and his demeanour full of that heartiness which , to most people who have anything generous in their composition , is peculiarly prepossessing . Add to this , that he was good - looking and intelligent , had a plentiful share of vivacity , was extremely cheerful , and accommodated himself in five minutes ’
272819	272834	272836	272836	Nicholas	526	‘ But it ’s a most extraordinary thing about that register - office fellow ! ’
272838	272976	272978	272978	Nicholas	526	‘ Is it likely that this nephew can know anything about that beautiful girl ? When Tim Linkinwater gave me to understand the other day that he was coming to take a share in the business here , he said he had been superintending it in Germany for four years , and that during the last six months he had been engaged in establishing an agency in the north of England . That ’s four years and a half -- four years and a half . She ca n’t be more than seventeen -- say eighteen at the outside . She was quite a child when he went away , then . I should say he knew nothing about her and had never seen her , so HE can give me no information . At all events , ’
272989	273011	272978	272978	Nicholas	526	‘ there can be no danger of any prior occupation of her affections in that quarter ; that ’s quite clear . ’
273666	273679	273681	273682	Tim Linkinwater	482	‘ That Mr. Frank and Mr. Nickleby should have met last night , ’
273718	273752	273754	273754	Tim	482	‘ that those two young men should have met last night in that manner is , I say , a coincidence , a remarkable coincidence . Why , I do n’t believe now , ’
273768	273785	273754	273754	Tim	482	‘ that there ’s such a place in all the world for coincidences as London is ! ’
273786	273794	273796	273797	Mr. Frank	481	‘ I do n’t know about that , ’
273799	273801	273796	273797	Mr. Frank	481	‘ but-- ’
273802	273812	273814	273814	Tim	482	‘ Do n’t know about it , Mr. Francis ! ’
273821	273898	273900	273900	Tim	482	‘ Well , but let us know . If there is any better place for such things , where is it ? Is it in Europe ? No , that it is n’t . Is it in Asia ? Why , of course it ’s not . Is it in Africa ? Not a bit of it . Is it in America ? YOU know better than that , at all events . Well , then , ’
273907	273912	273900	273900	Tim	482	‘ where is it ? ’
273913	273925	273927	273928	young Cheeryble	481	‘ I was not about to dispute the point , Tim , ’
273932	273965	273927	273928	young Cheeryble	481	‘ I am not such a heretic as that . All I was going to say was , that I hold myself under an obligation to the coincidence , that ’s all . ’
273966	273976	273978	273978	Tim	482	‘ Oh ! if you do n’t dispute it , ’
273983	274016	274018	274018	Tim	482	‘ that ’s another thing . I ’ll tell you what though . I wish you had . I wish you or anybody would . I would so put that man down , ’
274032	274040	274018	274018	Tim	482	‘ so put that man down by argument-- ’
274093	274102	274104	274104	Charles	355	‘ We may consider ourselves , brother Ned , ’
274117	274149	274107	274107	he	355	‘ very fortunate in having two such young men about us as our nephew Frank and Mr. Nickleby . It should be a source of great satisfaction and pleasure to us . ’
274150	274157	274159	274160	the other	8439	‘ Certainly , Charles , certainly , ’
274162	274166	274168	274169	brother Ned	12823	‘ Of Tim , ’
274171	274215	274169	274169	Ned	484	‘ I say nothing whatever , because Tim is a mere child -- an infant -- a nobody that we never think of or take into account at all . Tim , you villain , what do you say to that , sir ? ’
274216	274223	274107	274107	he	355	‘ I am jealous of both of ‘
274226	274230	274169	274169	Ned	484	’ said Tim , ‘
274250	274415	274416	274417	Mr. Nickleby	208	’ Tim thought this such an exquisite , unparalleled , and most extraordinary joke , that he laid his pen upon the inkstand , and rather tumbling off his stool than getting down with his usual deliberation , laughed till he was quite faint , shaking his head all the time so that little particles of powder flew palpably about the office . Nor were the brothers at all behind - hand , for they laughed almost as heartily at the ludicrous idea of any voluntary separation between themselves and old Tim . Nicholas and Mr. Frank laughed quite boisterously , perhaps to conceal some other emotion awakened by this little incident , ( and so , indeed , did the three old fellows after the first burst , ) so perhaps there was as much keen enjoyment and relish in that laugh , altogether , as the politest assembly ever derived from the most poignant witticism uttered at any one person ’s expense . ‘
274419	274436	274416	274417	Mr. Nickleby	208	’ said brother Charles , calling him aside , and taking him kindly by the hand , ‘
274646	274872	274629	274630	Brother Ned	484	’ The twins went out of the office arm - in - arm , and Nicholas , who saw in this act of kindness , and many others of which he had been the subject that morning , only so many delicate renewals on the arrival of their nephew of the kind assurance which the brothers had given him in his absence , could scarcely feel sufficient admiration and gratitude for such extraordinary consideration . The intelligence that they were to have a visitor -- and such a visitor -- next day , awakened in the breast of Mrs. Nickleby mingled feelings of exultation and regret ; for whereas on the one hand she hailed it as an omen of her speedy restoration to good society and the almost - forgotten pleasures of morning calls and evening tea - drinkings , she could not , on the other , but reflect with bitterness of spirit on the absence of a silver teapot with an ivory knob on the lid , and a milk - jug to match , which had been the pride of her heart in days of yore , and had been kept from year ’s end to year ’s end wrapped up in wash - leather on a certain top shelf which now presented itself in lively colours to her sorrowing imagination . ‘
274883	274892	274873	274873	I	0	’ said Mrs. Nickleby , shaking her head . ‘
274921	274922	274919	274919	Kate	210	’ ‘
274928	274929	274926	274926	mama	9827	’ ‘
274939	274949	274937	274937	Kate	210	’ returned Mrs. Nickleby , in a severe manner , ‘
274984	274997	274978	274978	I	0	’ said Mrs. Nickleby , rubbing her nose with an impassioned air , ‘
275014	275015	275016	275016	My	0	’ ‘
275020	275033	275036	275036	you	6048	’ said Kate , stealing her arm round her mother ’s neck , ‘
275255	275263	275252	275253	Dear mama	11206	’ said Kate , in great agitation , ‘
275304	275305	275306	275306	Kate	210	’ ‘
275312	275323	275310	275310	Kate	210	’ cried Mrs. Nickleby , folding her in her arms . ‘
275330	275334	275310	275310	Kate	210	’ sobbed Kate , ‘
275394	275903	275906	275907	Mr. Cheerybles	532	’ A gush of tears came to her relief , and Kate laid her head upon her mother ’s breast , and wept like a little child . It is an exquisite and beautiful thing in our nature , that when the heart is touched and softened by some tranquil happiness or affectionate feeling , the memory of the dead comes over it most powerfully and irresistibly . It would almost seem as though our better thoughts and sympathies were charms , in virtue of which the soul is enabled to hold some vague and mysterious intercourse with the spirits of those whom we dearly loved in life . Alas ! how often and how long may those patient angels hover above us , watching for the spell which is so seldom uttered , and so soon forgotten ! Poor Mrs. Nickleby , accustomed to give ready utterance to whatever came uppermost in her mind , had never conceived the possibility of her daughter ’s dwelling upon these thoughts in secret , the more especially as no hard trial or querulous reproach had ever drawn them from her . But now , when the happiness of all that Nicholas had just told them , and of their new and peaceful life , brought these recollections so strongly upon Kate that she could not suppress them , Mrs. Nickleby began to have a glimmering that she had been rather thoughtless now and then , and was conscious of something like self - reproach as she embraced her daughter , and yielded to the emotions which such a conversation naturally awakened . There was a mighty bustle that night , and a vast quantity of preparation for the expected visitor , and a very large nosegay was brought from a gardener ’s hard by , and cut up into a number of very small ones , with which Mrs. Nickleby would have garnished the little sitting - room , in a style that certainly could not have failed to attract anybody ’s attention , if Kate had not offered to spare her the trouble , and arranged them in the prettiest and neatest manner possible . If the cottage ever looked pretty , it must have been on such a bright and sunshiny day as the next day was . But Smike ’s pride in the garden , or Mrs. Nickleby ’s in the condition of the furniture , or Kate ’s in everything , was nothing to the pride with which Nicholas looked at Kate herself ; and surely the costliest mansion in all England might have found in her beautiful face and graceful form its most exquisite and peerless ornament . About six o’clock in the afternoon Mrs. Nickleby was thrown into a great flutter of spirits by the long - expected knock at the door , nor was this flutter at all composed by the audible tread of two pair of boots in the passage , which Mrs. Nickleby augured , in a breathless state , must be ‘
275909	276220	275906	275907	Mr. Cheerybles	532	’ as it certainly was , though not the two Mrs. Nickleby expected , because it was Mr. Charles Cheeryble , and his nephew , Mr. Frank , who made a thousand apologies for his intrusion , which Mrs. Nickleby ( having tea - spoons enough and to spare for all ) most graciously received . Nor did the appearance of this unexpected visitor occasion the least embarrassment , ( save in Kate , and that only to the extent of a blush or two at first , ) for the old gentleman was so kind and cordial , and the young gentleman imitated him in this respect so well , that the usual stiffness and formality of a first meeting showed no signs of appearing , and Kate really more than once detected herself in the very act of wondering when it was going to begin . At the tea - table there was plenty of conversation on a great variety of subjects , nor were there wanting jocose matters of discussion , such as they were ; for young Mr. Cheeryble ’s recent stay in Germany happening to be alluded to , old Mr. Cheeryble informed the company that the aforesaid young Mr. Cheeryble was suspected to have fallen deeply in love with the daughter of a certain German burgomaster . This accusation young Mr. Cheeryble most indignantly repelled , upon which Mrs. Nickleby slyly remarked , that she suspected , from the very warmth of the denial , there must be something in it . Young Mr. Cheeryble then earnestly entreated old Mr. Cheeryble to confess that it was all a jest , which old Mr. Cheeryble at last did , young Mr. Cheeryble being so much in earnest about it , that -- as Mrs. Nickleby said many thousand times afterwards in recalling the scene -- he ‘
276224	277239	277241	277241	thyself	6064	’ which she rightly considered a memorable circumstance , and one worthy of remark , young men not being as a class remarkable for modesty or self - denial , especially when there is a lady in the case , when , if they colour at all , it is rather their practice to colour the story , and not themselves . After tea there was a walk in the garden , and the evening being very fine they strolled out at the garden - gate into some lanes and bye - roads , and sauntered up and down until it grew quite dark . The time seemed to pass very quickly with all the party . Kate went first , leaning upon her brother ’s arm , and talking with him and Mr. Frank Cheeryble ; and Mrs. Nickleby and the elder gentleman followed at a short distance , the kindness of the good merchant , his interest in the welfare of Nicholas , and his admiration of Kate , so operating upon the good lady ’s feelings , that the usual current of her speech was confined within very narrow and circumscribed limits . Smike ( who , if he had ever been an object of interest in his life , had been one that day ) accompanied them , joining sometimes one group and sometimes the other , as brother Charles , laying his hand upon his shoulder , bade him walk with him , or Nicholas , looking smilingly round , beckoned him to come and talk with the old friend who understood him best , and who could win a smile into his careworn face when none else could . Pride is one of the seven deadly sins ; but it can not be the pride of a mother in her children , for that is a compound of two cardinal virtues -- faith and hope . This was the pride which swelled Mrs. Nickleby ’s heart that night , and this it was which left upon her face , glistening in the light when they returned home , traces of the most grateful tears she had ever shed . There was a quiet mirth about the little supper , which harmonised exactly with this tone of feeling , and at length the two gentlemen took their leave . There was one circumstance in the leave - taking which occasioned a vast deal of smiling and pleasantry , and that was , that Mr Frank Cheeryble offered his hand to Kate twice over , quite forgetting that he had bade her adieu already . This was held by the elder Mr Cheeryble to be a convincing proof that he was thinking of his German flame , and the jest occasioned immense laughter . So easy is it to move light hearts . In short , it was a day of serene and tranquil happiness ; and as we all have some bright day -- many of us , let us hope , among a crowd of others -- to which we revert with particular delight , so this one was often looked back to afterwards , as holding a conspicuous place in the calendar of those who shared it . Was there one exception , and that one he who needed to have been most happy ? Who was that who , in the silence of his own chamber , sunk upon his knees to pray as his first friend had taught him , and folding his hands and stretching them wildly in the air , fell upon his face in a passion of bitter grief ? CHAPTER 44 Mr. Ralph Nickleby cuts an old Acquaintance . It would also appear from the Contents hereof , that a Joke , even between Husband and Wife , may be sometimes carried too far There are some men who , living with the one object of enriching themselves , no matter by what means , and being perfectly conscious of the baseness and rascality of the means which they will use every day towards this end , affect nevertheless -- even to themselves -- a high tone of moral rectitude , and shake their heads and sigh over the depravity of the world . Some of the craftiest scoundrels that ever walked this earth , or rather -- for walking implies , at least , an erect position and the bearing of a man -- that ever crawled and crept through life by its dirtiest and narrowest ways , will gravely jot down in diaries the events of every day , and keep a regular debtor and creditor account with Heaven , which shall always show a floating balance in their own favour . Whether this is a gratuitous ( the only gratuitous ) part of the falsehood and trickery of such men ’s lives , or whether they really hope to cheat Heaven itself , and lay up treasure in the next world by the same process which has enabled them to lay up treasure in this -- not to question how it is , so it is . And , doubtless , such book - keeping ( like certain autobiographies which have enlightened the world ) can not fail to prove serviceable , in the one respect of sparing the recording Angel some time and labour . Ralph Nickleby was not a man of this stamp . Stern , unyielding , dogged , and impenetrable , Ralph cared for nothing in life , or beyond it , save the gratification of two passions , avarice , the first and predominant appetite of his nature , and hatred , the second . Affecting to consider himself but a type of all humanity , he was at little pains to conceal his true character from the world in general , and in his own heart he exulted over and cherished every bad design as it had birth . The only scriptural admonition that Ralph Nickleby heeded , in the letter , was ‘
277243	277411	277241	277241	thyself	6064	’ He knew himself well , and choosing to imagine that all mankind were cast in the same mould , hated them ; for , though no man hates himself , the coldest among us having too much self - love for that , yet most men unconsciously judge the world from themselves , and it will be very generally found that those who sneer habitually at human nature , and affect to despise it , are among its worst and least pleasant samples . But the present business of these adventures is with Ralph himself , who stood regarding Newman Noggs with a heavy frown , while that worthy took off his fingerless gloves , and spreading them carefully on the palm of his left hand , and flattening them with his right to take the creases out , proceeded to roll them up with an absent air as if he were utterly regardless of all things else , in the deep interest of the ceremonial . ‘
277417	277423	277427	277427	yours	6066	’ said Ralph , slowly . ‘
277433	277434	277427	277427	yours	6066	’ ‘
277438	277442	277427	277427	yours	6066	’ returned Newman . ‘
277449	277450	277452	277452	he	6067	’ ‘
277458	277467	277468	277468	I	0	’ muttered Ralph , with a fretful gesture . ‘
277473	277477	277468	277468	I	0	’ said Newman , ‘
277483	277489	277479	277479	he	6067	’ The repetition of the word ‘
277491	277553	277468	277468	I	0	’ seemed to afford Newman Noggs inexpressible delight , in proportion as it annoyed Ralph Nickleby . He uttered the word with a full round emphasis , dwelling upon it as long as he decently could , and when he could hold out no longer without attracting observation , stood gasping it to himself as if even that were a satisfaction . ‘
277560	277564	277557	277557	he	6067	’ said Ralph . ‘
277567	277571	277557	277557	he	6067	’ replied Newman . ‘
277599	277600	277595	277595	he	6067	’ ‘
277605	277609	277602	277603	Lord Frederick--	534	’ began Ralph . ‘
277615	277619	277621	277621	he	6067	’ replied Newman . ‘
277631	277638	277629	277629	he	6067	’ said Ralph , turning away ; ‘
277659	277660	277629	277629	he	6067	’ ‘
277666	277670	277661	277661	He	6067	’ said Newman . ‘
277674	277678	277661	277661	He	6067	’ repeated Ralph . ‘
277728	277766	277708	277708	I	0	’ Uttering these words with supreme contempt and great irritation of manner , Ralph signed hastily to Newman to leave the room ; and throwing himself into his chair , beat his foot impatiently upon the ground . ‘
277775	277783	277708	277708	I	0	’ said Ralph , grinding his teeth . ‘
277808	277860	277861	277862	This Hawk	6073	’ He thrust his hands impatiently into his pockets , but notwithstanding his previous reflection there was some consolation there , for his face relaxed a little ; and although there was still a deep frown upon the contracted brow , it was one of calculation , and not of disappointment . ‘
277869	277873	277861	277862	This Hawk	6073	’ muttered Ralph ; ‘
277967	278001	278002	278004	That Mr. Squeers	6078	’ He smiled and shook his head , and resting his chin upon his hand , fell a musing , and smiled again . After a time he rose and rang the bell . ‘
278011	278015	278016	278016	He	6078	’ said Ralph . ‘
278031	278035	278022	278022	I	0	’ returned Newman . ‘
278046	278052	278043	278043	I	0	’ said Ralph , irascibly . ‘
278065	278066	278060	278060	he	6078	’ ‘
278069	278079	278060	278060	he	6078	’ bawled Newman , in a very loud key . ‘
278119	278126	278128	278128	him	6078	’ said Ralph , checking himself , ‘
278132	278133	278128	278128	him	6078	’ ‘
278135	278140	278142	278142	Newman	211	‘ em both wait ? ’
278144	278147	278149	278149	Ralph	208	‘ Ay , ’
278159	278179	278149	278149	Ralph	208	‘ Help me on with this spencer , and do n’t repeat after me , like a croaking parrot . ’
278180	278188	278189	278189	Newman	211	‘ I wish I was a parrot , ’
278193	278199	278201	278201	Ralph	208	‘ I wish you were , ’
278208	278218	278201	278201	Ralph	208	‘ I ’d have wrung your neck long ago . ’
279217	279234	279235	279235	he	8927	‘ You would hardly have known me from my voice , I suppose , Mr. Nickleby ? ’
279238	279241	279243	279243	Ralph	208	‘ No , ’
279252	279265	279243	279243	Ralph	208	‘ Though there is something in that , that I remember now . ’
279266	279290	279292	279293	the other	8439	‘ There is little in me that you can call to mind as having been there eight years ago , I dare say ? ’
279295	279299	279301	279301	Ralph	208	‘ Quite enough , ’
279310	279315	279301	279301	Ralph	208	‘ More than enough . ’
279316	279329	279331	279332	the other	8439	‘ If I had remained in doubt about YOU , Mr. Nickleby , ’
279334	279349	279331	279332	the other	8439	‘ this reception , and YOUR manner , would have decided me very soon . ’
279350	279357	279359	279359	Ralph	208	‘ Did you expect any other ? ’
279363	279366	279368	279369	the man	8927	‘ No ! ’
279371	279376	279378	279378	Ralph	208	‘ You were right , ’
279380	279392	279378	279378	Ralph	208	‘ and as you feel no surprise , need express none . ’
279393	279397	279399	279400	the man	8927	‘ Mr. Nickleby , ’
279426	279439	279411	279411	he	8927	‘ will you hear a few words that I have to say ? ’
279440	279454	279456	279456	Ralph	208	‘ I am obliged to wait here till the rain holds a little , ’
279461	279491	279456	279456	Ralph	208	‘ If you talk , sir , I shall not put my fingers in my ears , though your talking may have as much effect as if I did . ’
279492	279499	279501	279502	his companion	1007	‘ I was once in your confidence-- ’
279513	279516	279518	279519	the other	8439	‘ Well , ’
279521	279536	279518	279519	the other	8439	‘ as much in your confidence as you ever chose to let anybody be . ’
279537	279540	279542	279542	Ralph	208	‘ Ah ! ’
279548	279558	279542	279542	Ralph	208	‘ that ’s another thing , quite another thing . ’
279559	279577	279518	279519	the other	8439	‘ Do n’t let us play upon words , Mr. Nickleby , in the name of humanity . ’
279578	279582	279584	279584	Ralph	208	‘ Of what ? ’
279586	279590	279592	279593	the other	8439	‘ Of humanity , ’
279597	279739	279592	279593	the other	8439	‘ I am hungry and in want . If the change that you must see in me after so long an absence -- must see , for I , upon whom it has come by slow and hard degrees , see it and know it well -- will not move you to pity , let the knowledge that bread ; not the daily bread of the Lord ’s Prayer , which , as it is offered up in cities like this , is understood to include half the luxuries of the world for the rich , and just as much coarse food as will support life for the poor -- not that , but bread , a crust of dry hard bread , is beyond my reach today -- let that have some weight with you , if nothing else has . ’
279740	279754	279756	279756	Ralph	208	‘ If this is the usual form in which you beg , sir , ’
279758	279809	279756	279756	Ralph	208	‘ you have studied your part well ; but if you will take advice from one who knows something of the world and its ways , I should recommend a lower tone ; a little lower tone , or you stand a fair chance of being starved in good earnest . ’
279869	279878	279880	279882	the old man	897	‘ Yesterday was my first day in London , ’
279895	279915	279917	279917	Ralph	208	‘ It would have been better for you , I think , if it had been your last also , ’
279919	279940	279942	279943	the other	8439	‘ I have been seeking you these two days , where I thought you were most likely to be found , ’
279947	279971	279942	279943	the other	8439	‘ and I met you here at last , when I had almost given up the hope of encountering you , Mr Nickleby . ’
279989	280015	279986	279986	he	8439	‘ I am a most miserable and wretched outcast , nearly sixty years old , and as destitute and helpless as a child of six . ’
280016	280025	280027	280027	Ralph	208	‘ I am sixty years old , too , ’
280029	280054	280027	280027	Ralph	208	‘ and am neither destitute nor helpless . Work . Do n’t make fine play - acting speeches about bread , but earn it . ’
280055	280058	280060	280061	the other	8439	‘ How ? ’
280063	280081	280060	280061	the other	8439	‘ Where ? Show me the means . Will you give them to me -- will you ? ’
280082	280087	280089	280089	Ralph	208	‘ I did once , ’
280093	280104	280089	280089	Ralph	208	‘ you scarcely need ask me whether I will again . ’
280105	280115	280117	280118	the man	8927	‘ It ’s twenty years ago , or more , ’
280125	280182	280117	280118	the man	8927	‘ since you and I fell out . You remember that ? I claimed a share in the profits of some business I brought to you , and , as I persisted , you arrested me for an old advance of ten pounds , odd shillings , including interest at fifty per cent , or so . ’
280183	280190	280192	280192	Ralph	208	‘ I remember something of it , ’
280196	280200	280192	280192	Ralph	208	‘ What then ? ’
280201	280208	280210	280211	the man	8927	‘ That did n’t part us , ’
280213	280268	280192	280192	Ralph	208	‘ I made submission , being on the wrong side of the bolts and bars ; and as you were not the made man then that you are now , you were glad enough to take back a clerk who was n’t over nice , and who knew something of the trade you drove . ’
280269	280279	280281	280281	Ralph	208	‘ You begged and prayed , and I consented , ’
280283	280336	280281	280281	Ralph	208	‘ That was kind of me . Perhaps I did want you . I forget . I should think I did , or you would have begged in vain . You were useful ; not too honest , not too delicate , not too nice of hand or heart ; but useful . ’
280337	280342	280344	280345	the man	8927	‘ Useful , indeed ! ’
280347	280386	280344	280345	the man	8927	‘ Come . You had pinched and ground me down for some years before that , but I had served you faithfully up to that time , in spite of all your dog ’s usage . Had I ? ’
280392	280396	280398	280399	the man	8927	‘ Had I ? ’
280402	280409	280411	280411	Ralph	208	‘ You had had your wages , ’
280413	280434	280411	280411	Ralph	208	‘ and had done your work . We stood on equal ground so far , and could both cry quits . ’
280435	280442	280444	280445	the other	8439	‘ Then , but not afterwards , ’
280447	280474	280476	280476	Ralph	208	‘ Not afterwards , certainly , nor even then , for ( as you have just said ) you owed me money , and do still , ’
280478	280484	280486	280487	the man	8927	‘ That ’s not all , ’
280491	280629	280631	280632	the man	8927	‘ That ’s not all . Mark that . I did n’t forget that old sore , trust me . Partly in remembrance of that , and partly in the hope of making money someday by the scheme , I took advantage of my position about you , and possessed myself of a hold upon you , which you would give half of all you have to know , and never can know but through me . I left you -- long after that time , remember -- and , for some poor trickery that came within the law , but was nothing to what you money - makers daily practise just outside its bounds , was sent away a convict for seven years . I have returned what you see me . Now , Mr Nickleby , ’
280645	280703	280631	280632	the man	8927	‘ what help and assistance will you give me ; what bribe , to speak out plainly ? My expectations are not monstrous , but I must live , and to live I must eat and drink . Money is on your side , and hunger and thirst on mine . You may drive an easy bargain . ’
280704	280709	280711	280711	Ralph	208	‘ Is that all ? ’
280730	280746	280748	280749	the rejoinder	6133	‘ It depends on you , Mr. Nickleby , whether that ’s all or not , ’
280751	280772	280774	280774	Ralph	208	‘ Why then , harkye , Mr-- , I do n’t know by what name I am to call you , ’
280776	280786	280774	280774	Ralph	208	‘ By my old one , if you like . ’
280787	280796	280798	280798	Ralph	208	‘ Why then , harkye , Mr. Brooker , ’
280805	280908	280798	280798	Ralph	208	‘ and do n’t expect to draw another speech from me . Harkye , sir . I know you of old for a ready scoundrel , but you never had a stout heart ; and hard work , with ( maybe ) chains upon those legs of yours , and shorter food than when I “ pinched ” and “ ground ” you , has blunted your wits , or you would not come with such a tale as this to me . You a hold upon me ! Keep it , or publish it to the world , if you like . ’
280909	280916	280918	280918	Brooker	535	‘ I ca n’t do that , ’
280920	280927	280918	280918	Brooker	535	‘ That would n’t serve me . ’
280928	280933	280935	280935	Ralph	208	‘ Would n’t it ? ’
280937	281067	281069	281069	Ralph	208	‘ It will serve you as much as bringing it to me , I promise you . To be plain with you , I am a careful man , and know my affairs thoroughly . I know the world , and the world knows me . Whatever you gleaned , or heard , or saw , when you served me , the world knows and magnifies already . You could tell it nothing that would surprise it , unless , indeed , it redounded to my credit or honour , and then it would scout you for a liar . And yet I do n’t find business slack , or clients scrupulous . Quite the contrary . I am reviled or threatened every day by one man or another , ’
281071	281088	281069	281069	Ralph	208	‘ but things roll on just the same , and I do n’t grow poorer either . ’
281089	281096	281098	281099	the man	8927	‘ I neither revile nor threaten , ’
281101	281140	281098	281099	the man	8927	‘ I can tell you of what you have lost by my act , what I only can restore , and what , if I die without restoring , dies with me , and never can be regained . ’
281141	281158	281160	281160	Ralph	208	‘ I tell my money pretty accurately , and generally keep it in my own custody , ’
281162	281195	281160	281160	Ralph	208	‘ I look sharply after most men that I deal with , and most of all I looked sharply after you . You are welcome to all you have kept from me . ’
281196	281207	281209	281210	the man	8927	‘ Are those of your own name dear to you ? ’
281213	281217	281209	281210	the man	8927	‘ If they are-- ’
281218	281223	281225	281225	Ralph	208	‘ They are not , ’
281244	281315	281236	281236	Nicholas	207	‘ They are not . If you had come as a common beggar , I might have thrown a sixpence to you in remembrance of the clever knave you used to be ; but since you try to palm these stale tricks upon one you might have known better , I ’ll not part with a halfpenny -- nor would I to save you from rotting . And remember this , ‘
281320	281330	281225	281225	Ralph	208	’ said Ralph , menacing him with his hand , ‘
281389	281635	281380	281380	my	0	’ With a disdainful scowl at the object of his anger , who met his eye but uttered not a word , Ralph walked away at his usual pace , without manifesting the slightest curiosity to see what became of his late companion , or indeed once looking behind him . The man remained on the same spot with his eyes fixed upon his retreating figure until it was lost to view , and then drawing his arm about his chest , as if the damp and lack of food struck coldly to him , lingered with slouching steps by the wayside , and begged of those who passed along . Ralph , in no - wise moved by what had lately passed , further than as he had already expressed himself , walked deliberately on , and turning out of the Park and leaving Golden Square on his right , took his way through some streets at the west end of the town until he arrived in that particular one in which stood the residence of Madame Mantalini . The name of that lady no longer appeared on the flaming door - plate , that of Miss Knag being substituted in its stead ; but the bonnets and dresses were still dimly visible in the first - floor windows by the decaying light of a summer ’s evening , and excepting this ostensible alteration in the proprietorship , the establishment wore its old appearance . ‘
281638	281664	281380	281380	my	0	’ muttered Ralph , drawing his hand across his mouth with a connoisseur - like air , and surveying the house from top to bottom ; ‘
281710	281816	281698	281698	I	0	’ So , nodding his head very complacently , Ralph was leaving the spot , when his quick ear caught the sound of a confused noise and hubbub of voices , mingled with a great running up and down stairs , in the very house which had been the subject of his scrutiny ; and while he was hesitating whether to knock at the door or listen at the keyhole a little longer , a female servant of Madame Mantalini ’s ( whom he had often seen ) opened it abruptly and bounced out , with her blue cap - ribbons streaming in the air . ‘
281822	281826	281698	281698	I	0	’ cried Ralph . ‘
281842	281843	281839	281839	me	0	’ ‘
281851	281856	281846	281847	Mr. Nickleby	208	’ said the girl . ‘

281879	281885	281887	281887	d’ye	6145	’ said Ralph , tartly ; ‘
281890	281891	281894	281894	he	8990	’ ‘
281903	281908	281909	281909	I	0	’ cried the girl . ‘

281924	281934	281920	281920	you	0	’ said Ralph , catching her by the wrist ; ‘
281962	282282	281956	281956	you	0	’ Without any further expostulation , he led or rather pulled the frightened handmaid into the house , and shut the door ; then bidding her walk upstairs before him , followed without more ceremony . Guided by the noise of a great many voices all talking together , and passing the girl in his impatience , before they had ascended many steps , Ralph quickly reached the private sitting - room , when he was rather amazed by the confused and inexplicable scene in which he suddenly found himself . There were all the young - lady workers , some with bonnets and some without , in various attitudes expressive of alarm and consternation ; some gathered round Madame Mantalini , who was in tears upon one chair ; and others round Miss Knag , who was in opposition tears upon another ; and others round Mr. Mantalini , who was perhaps the most striking figure in the whole group , for Mr. Mantalini ’s legs were extended at full length upon the floor , and his head and shoulders were supported by a very tall footman , who did n’t seem to know what to do with them , and Mr Mantalini ’s eyes were closed , and his face was pale and his hair was comparatively straight , and his whiskers and moustache were limp , and his teeth were clenched , and he had a little bottle in his right hand , and a little tea - spoon in his left ; and his hands , arms , legs , and shoulders , were all stiff and powerless . And yet Madame Mantalini was not weeping upon the body , but was scolding violently upon her chair ; and all this amidst a clamour of tongues perfectly deafening , and which really appeared to have driven the unfortunate footman to the utmost verge of distraction . ‘
282289	282317	282318	282318	He	6151	’ said Ralph , pressing forward . At this inquiry , the clamour was increased twenty - fold , and an astounding string of such shrill contradictions as ‘
282389	282393	282395	282396	Madame Mantalini	290	‘ Mr. Nickleby , ’
282398	282411	282395	282396	Madame Mantalini	290	‘ by what chance you came here , I do n’t know . ’
282433	282437	282395	282396	Madame Mantalini	290	‘ Demnition sweetness ! ’
282508	282514	282516	282517	Madame Mantalini	290	‘ I will , however , ’
282529	282622	282520	282520	her	290	‘ say before you , and before everybody here , for the first time , and once for all , that I never will supply that man ’s extravagances and viciousness again . I have been a dupe and a fool to him long enough . In future , he shall support himself if he can , and then he may spend what money he pleases , upon whom and how he pleases ; but it shall not be mine , and therefore you had better pause before you trust him further . ’
282759	282771	282773	282774	Madame Mantalini	290	‘ And I insist on being separated and left to myself , ’
282778	282816	282773	282774	Madame Mantalini	290	‘ If he dares to refuse me a separation , I ’ll have one in law -- I can -- and I hope this will be a warning to all girls who have seen this disgraceful exhibition . ’
282871	282883	282885	282885	Ralph	208	‘ Why do you say all this before so many listeners ? ’
282892	282901	282885	282885	Ralph	208	‘ You know you are not in earnest . ’
282902	282908	282910	282911	Madame Mantalini	290	‘ I AM in earnest , ’
282921	282927	282929	282929	Ralph	208	‘ Well , but consider , ’
282940	282955	282929	282929	Ralph	208	‘ It would be well to reflect . A married woman has no property . ’
282956	282967	282969	282970	Mr. Mantalini	289	‘ Not a solitary single individual dem , my soul , ’
282978	282986	282988	282989	Madame Mantalini	290	‘ I am quite aware of that , ’
282995	283021	282992	282992	her	290	‘ and I have none . The business , the stock , this house , and everything in it , all belong to Miss Knag . ’
283022	283031	283033	283034	Miss Knag	293	‘ That ’s quite true , Madame Mantalini , ’
283052	283117	283033	283034	Miss Knag	293	‘ Very true , indeed , Madame Mantalini -- hem -- very true . And I never was more glad in all my life , that I had strength of mind to resist matrimonial offers , no matter how advantageous , than I am when I think of my present position as compared with your most unfortunate and most undeserved one , Madame Mantalini . ’
283118	283121	283123	283124	Mr. Mantalini	289	‘ Demmit ! ’
283133	283153	283127	283127	his	289	‘ Will it not slap and pinch the envious dowager , that dares to reflect upon its own delicious ? ’

283176	283182	283173	283174	his wife	648	‘ is my particular friend ; ’

283416	283419	283421	283422	Mr. Mantalini	289	‘ Nickleby , ’
283426	283459	283421	283422	Mr. Mantalini	289	‘ you have been made a witness to this demnition cruelty , on the part of the demdest enslaver and captivator that never was , oh dem ! I forgive that woman . ’
283460	283463	283465	283466	Madame Mantalini	290	‘ Forgive ! ’
283470	283478	283480	283481	Mr. Mantalini	289	‘ I do forgive her , Nickleby , ’
283483	283588	283480	283481	Mr. Mantalini	289	‘ You will blame me , the world will blame me , the women will blame me ; everybody will laugh , and scoff , and smile , and grin most demnebly . They will say , “ She had a blessing . She did not know it . He was too weak ; he was too good ; he was a dem’d fine fellow , but he loved too strong ; he could not bear her to be cross , and call him wicked names . It was a dem’d case , there never was a demder . ” But I forgive her . ’
283655	283671	283673	283673	Ralph	208	‘ You may put away those fooleries now , and live by your wits again , ’
283681	283687	283673	283673	Ralph	208	‘ Demmit , Nickleby , you ’re

283697	283701	283693	283693	I	0	’ said Ralph . ‘

283712	283716	283711	283711	Nickleby--	537	’ said Mantalini . ‘
283723	283727	283717	283717	I	0	’ rejoined Ralph . ‘
283741	283775	283732	283732	You	537	’ Affecting not to hear his entreaties that he would stay and advise with him , Ralph left the crest - fallen Mr. Mantalini to his meditations , and left the house quietly . ‘
283778	283782	283732	283732	You	537	’ he said , ‘
283812	283855	283803	283803	I	0	’ As he said this , he made some memorandum in his pocket - book in which Mr Mantalini ’s name figured conspicuously , and finding by his watch that it was between nine and ten o’clock , made all speed home . ‘
283860	283873	283803	283803	I	0	’ was the first question he asked of Newman . Newman nodded . ‘
283880	283881	283803	283803	I	0	’ ‘
283892	283893	283886	283890	One a fat sleek man	6177	’ ‘
283896	283900	283886	283890	One a fat sleek man	6177	’ said Newman . ‘

283910	283914	283886	283890	One a fat sleek man	6177	’ rejoined Ralph . ‘
283920	283921	283886	283890	One a fat sleek man	6177	’ ‘
283934	284123	284124	284124	I	0	’ stammered Newman . Ralph angrily repeated his orders , and Noggs , who might well have been excused for wondering at such an unusual and extraordinary circumstance ( for he had never seen Ralph in a coach in his life ) departed on his errand , and presently returned with the conveyance . Into it went Mr. Squeers , and Ralph , and the third man , whom Newman Noggs had never seen . Newman stood upon the door - step to see them off , not troubling himself to wonder where or upon what business they were going , until he chanced by mere accident to hear Ralph name the address whither the coachman was to drive . Quick as lightning and in a state of the most extreme wonder , Newman darted into his little office for his hat , and limped after the coach as if with the intention of getting up behind ; but in this design he was balked , for it had too much the start of him and was soon hopelessly ahead , leaving him gaping in the empty street . ‘
284130	284138	284124	284124	I	0	’ said Noggs , stopping for breath , ‘
284193	284362	284364	284364	we	6182	’ His reflections were interrupted by a grey - haired man of a very remarkable , though far from prepossessing appearance , who , coming stealthily towards him , solicited relief . Newman , still cogitating deeply , turned away ; but the man followed him , and pressed him with such a tale of misery that Newman ( who might have been considered a hopeless person to beg from , and who had little enough to give ) looked into his hat for some halfpence which he usually kept screwed up , when he had any , in a corner of his pocket - handkerchief . While he was busily untwisting the knot with his teeth , the man said something which attracted his attention ; whatever that something was , it led to something else , and in the end he and Newman walked away side by side -- the strange man talking earnestly , and Newman listening . CHAPTER 45 Containing Matter of a surprising Kind ‘
284367	284369	284364	284364	we	6182	’ fra ’

284409	284555	284364	284364	we	6182	’ So said John Browdie , rubbing his hands with great joyousness , and looking round him with a ruddy shining face , quite in keeping with the declaration . The time at which John found himself in this enviable condition was the same evening to which the last chapter bore reference ; the place was the cottage ; and the assembled company were Nicholas , Mrs. Nickleby , Mrs Browdie , Kate Nickleby , and Smike . A very merry party they had been . Mrs. Nickleby , knowing of her son ’s obligations to the honest Yorkshireman , had , after some demur , yielded her consent to Mr. and Mrs. Browdie being invited out to tea ; in the way of which arrangement , there were at first sundry difficulties and obstacles , arising out of her not having had an opportunity of ‘
284557	284659	284364	284364	we	6182	’ upon Mrs. Browdie first ; for although Mrs. Nickleby very often observed with much complacency ( as most punctilious people do ) , that she had not an atom of pride or formality about her , still she was a great stickler for dignity and ceremonies ; and as it was manifest that , until a call had been made , she could not be ( politely speaking , and according to the laws of society ) even cognisant of the fact of Mrs. Browdie ’s existence , she felt her situation to be one of peculiar delicacy and difficulty . ‘
284670	284675	284364	284364	we	6182	’ said Mrs. Nickleby , ‘
284730	284740	284722	284728	a very respectable - looking young man	6186	’ added Mrs. Nickleby , after a short consideration , ‘

284805	284809	284803	284803	mother	933	’ asked Nicholas . ‘

Then all Mrs. Browdie would have to do would be to send her card back by the carrier ( he could easily come with a double knock ) , and there ’s an end of it . ’
285025	285030	285032	285032	Nicholas	207	‘ My dear mother , ’
285034	285057	285032	285032	Nicholas	207	‘ I do n’t suppose such unsophisticated people as these ever had a card of their own , or ever will have . ’
285058	285069	285071	285072	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ Oh that , indeed , Nicholas , my dear , ’
285074	285147	285071	285072	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ that ’s another thing . If you put it upon that ground , why , of course , I have no more to say , than that I have no doubt they are very good sort of persons , and that I have no kind of objection to their coming here to tea if they like , and shall make a point of being very civil to them if they do . ’
285431	285438	285421	285421	she	207	‘ rather high in her notions , ’
285538	285542	285544	285544	Kate	210	‘ Mr. Browdie , ’
285551	285591	285544	285544	Kate	210	‘ is the best - humoured , the kindest and heartiest creature I ever saw . If I were oppressed with I do n’t know how many cares , it would make me happy only to look at him . ’
285592	285609	285611	285612	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ He does seem indeed , upon my word , a most excellent creature , Kate , ’
285614	285658	285660	285661	Mrs Nickleby	207	‘ most excellent . And I am sure that at all times it will give me pleasure -- really pleasure now -- to have you , Mrs. Browdie , to see me in this plain and homely manner . We make no display , ’
285683	285725	285660	285661	Mrs Nickleby	207	‘ no fuss , no preparation ; I would n’t allow it . I said , “ Kate , my dear , you will only make Mrs. Browdie feel uncomfortable , and how very foolish and inconsiderate that would be ! ” ’
285726	285741	285743	285744	Mrs. Browdie	505	‘ I am very much obliged to you , I am sure , ma’am , ’
285748	285770	285743	285744	Mrs. Browdie	505	‘ It ’s nearly eleven o’clock , John . I am afraid we are keeping you up very late , ma’am . ’
285771	285774	285776	285777	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ Late ! ’
285800	286041	286042	286042	Kate	210	‘ This is quite early for us . We used to keep such hours ! Twelve , one , two , three o’clock was nothing to us . Balls , dinners , card - parties ! Never were such rakes as the people about where we used to live . I often think now , I am sure , that how we ever could go through with it is quite astonishing , and that is just the evil of having a large connection and being a great deal sought after , which I would recommend all young married people steadily to resist ; though of course , and it ’s perfectly clear , and a very happy thing too , I think , that very few young married people can be exposed to such temptations . There was one family in particular , that used to live about a mile from us -- not straight down the road , but turning sharp off to the left by the turnpike where the Plymouth mail ran over the donkey -- that were quite extraordinary people for giving the most extravagant parties , with artificial flowers and champagne , and variegated lamps , and , in short , every delicacy of eating and drinking that the most singular epicure could possibly require . I do n’t think that there ever were such people as those Peltiroguses . You remember the Peltiroguses , Kate ? ’
286322	286329	286331	286331	Nicholas	207	‘ It must be some mistake , ’
286335	286347	286331	286331	Nicholas	207	‘ We know nobody who would come here at this hour . ’
286366	286370	286348	286349	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ the Mr. Cheerybles ’
286434	286437	286439	286439	Ralph	208	‘ Stay , ’
286460	286471	286455	286455	herself	210	‘ Before that boy says a word , hear me . ’
286555	286562	286564	286564	Ralph	208	‘ Hear me , I say , ’
286566	286571	286564	286564	Ralph	208	‘ and not him . ’
286572	286583	286585	286585	John	202	‘ Say what thou’st gotten to say then , sir , ’

286774	286782	286770	286770	he	6233	’ cried Nicholas , burning with fury , ‘
286802	286831	286796	286796	he	6233	’ To all these exclamations John Browdie answered not a word , but he retained his hold upon Nicholas ; and when he was silent again , spoke . ‘
286844	286848	286796	286796	he	6233	’ said John . ‘
286853	286857	286796	286796	he	6233	’ gotten scent o ’
286896	286988	286886	286887	auld gen’l’man	6240	’ Hearing this adjuration , Mr. Squeers , who had been lingering in the passage until such time as it should be expedient for him to enter and he could appear with effect , was fain to present himself in a somewhat undignified and sneaking way ; at which John Browdie laughed with such keen and heartfelt delight , that even Kate , in all the pain , anxiety , and surprise of the scene , and though the tears were in her eyes , felt a disposition to join him . ‘
286997	287004	286993	286993	yourself	6241	’ said Ralph , at length . ‘
287014	287018	287012	287012	sir	714	’ replied John . ‘

287035	287073	287029	287029	your	6241	’ Ralph waited until there was a perfect silence , and then turning to Mrs Nickleby , but directing an eager glance at Kate , as if more anxious to watch his effect upon her , said : ‘
287179	287200	287216	287216	ma’am	8678	’ Mrs. Nickleby shook her head and sighed , as if there were a good deal in that , certainly . ‘
287205	287209	287210	287210	I	0	’ resumed Ralph , ‘
287289	287322	287285	287285	I	0	’ said Ralph , looking round with a biting and triumphant smile , and gloating and dwelling upon the words as if he were loath to lose the pleasure of saying them , ‘
287334	287355	287332	287332	sir	714	’ he continued , bending eagerly forward , and addressing Nicholas , as he marked the change of his countenance , ‘
287401	287402	287378	287378	you	714	’ ‘
287411	287417	287408	287408	you	714	’ said Nicholas , proudly . ‘
287434	287438	287428	287428	I	0	’ retorted Ralph . ‘
287441	287448	287450	287450	you	714	’ sneered Squeers , stepping forward . ‘
287533	287534	287531	287531	you	714	’ ‘
287546	287554	287542	287542	I	0	’ said Nicholas , looking quietly away , ‘
287583	287757	287580	287581	Mr Squeers	203	’ The estimable gentleman last named cast a hasty look at the table , as if he were prompted by this retort to throw a jug or bottle at the head of Nicholas , but he was interrupted in this design ( if such design he had ) by Ralph , who , touching him on the elbow , bade him tell the father that he might now appear and claim his son . This being purely a labour of love , Mr. Squeers readily complied , and leaving the room for the purpose , almost immediately returned , supporting a sleek personage with an oily face , who , bursting from him , and giving to view the form and face of Mr. Snawley , made straight up to Smike , and tucking that poor fellow ’s head under his arm in a most uncouth and awkward embrace , elevated his broad - brimmed hat at arm ’s length in the air as a token of devout thanksgiving , exclaiming , meanwhile , ‘

287791	287802	287803	287803	you	714	’ said Ralph , with a gruff expression of sympathy , ‘

287861	287908	287844	287844	he	6260	’ said John Browdie . Mr. Snawley was too much occupied by his parental feelings to notice this remark ; and , to assure himself more completely of the restoration of his child , tucked his head under his arm again , and kept it there . ‘
287913	287917	287844	287844	he	6260	’ said Snawley , ‘

287979	287983	287977	287977	sir	714	’ observed Squeers . ‘
287992	287996	287977	287977	sir	714	’ rejoined Snawley ; ‘

288079	288084	288085	288085	She	539	’ said Mr. Squeers . ‘
288088	288094	288106	288106	Snawley	232	‘ un , is Natur . ’
288095	288104	288106	288106	Snawley	232	‘ She is a holy thing , sir , ’
288108	288113	288115	288116	Mr. Squeers	203	‘ I believe you , ’
288123	288140	288142	288143	Mr. Squeers	203	‘ I should like to know how we should ever get on without her . Natur , ’
288147	288171	288142	288143	Mr. Squeers	203	‘ is more easier conceived than described . Oh what a blessed thing , sir , to be in a state of natur ! ’
288252	288261	288263	288263	Nicholas	207	‘ If you are this boy ’s father , ’
288265	288293	288263	288263	Nicholas	207	‘ look at the wreck he is , and tell me that you purpose to send him back to that loathsome den from which I brought him . ’
288294	288298	288300	288300	Squeers	203	‘ Scandal again ! ’
288302	288324	288300	288300	Squeers	203	‘ Recollect , you an’t worth powder and shot , but I ’ll be even with you one way or another . ’
288325	288328	288330	288330	Ralph	208	‘ Stop , ’
288339	288399	288333	288333	Snawley	232	‘ Let us cut this matter short , and not bandy words here with hare - brained profligates . This is your son , as you can prove . And you , Mr. Squeers , you know this boy to be the same that was with you for so many years under the name of Smike . Do you ? ’
288400	288404	288406	288406	Squeers	203	‘ Do I ! ’
288408	288413	288406	288406	Squeers	203	‘ Do n’t I ? ’
288414	288417	288419	288419	Ralph	208	‘ Good , ’
288421	288443	288419	288419	Ralph	208	‘ a very few words will be sufficient here . You had a son by your first wife , Mr. Snawley ? ’
288444	288448	288450	288451	that person	10070	‘ I had , ’
288453	288459	288450	288451	that person	10070	‘ and there he stands . ’
288460	288467	288469	288469	Ralph	208	‘ We ’ll show that presently , ’
288471	288524	288469	288469	Ralph	208	‘ You and your wife were separated , and she had the boy to live with her , when he was a year old . You received a communication from her , when you had lived apart a year or two , that the boy was dead ; and you believed it ? ’
288525	288531	288533	288533	Snawley	232	‘ Of course I did ! ’
288535	288540	288533	288533	Snawley	232	‘ Oh the joy of-- ’
288541	288549	288551	288551	Ralph	208	‘ Be rational , sir , pray , ’
288553	288598	288551	288551	Ralph	208	‘ This is business , and transports interfere with it . This wife died a year and a half ago , or thereabouts -- not more -- in some obscure place , where she was housekeeper in a family . Is that the case ? ’
288599	288605	288607	288607	Snawley	232	‘ That ’s the case , ’
288609	288658	288607	288607	Snawley	232	‘ Having written on her death - bed a letter or confession to you , about this very boy , which , as it was not directed otherwise than in your name , only reached you , and that by a circuitous course , a few days since ? ’
288659	288663	288665	288665	Snawley	232	‘ Just so , ’
288667	288675	288665	288665	Snawley	232	‘ Correct in every particular , sir . ’
288676	288681	288683	288683	Ralph	208	‘ And this confession , ’
288685	288786	288683	288683	Ralph	208	‘ is to the effect that his death was an invention of hers to wound you -- was a part of a system of annoyance , in short , which you seem to have adopted towards each other -- that the boy lived , but was of weak and imperfect intellect -- that she sent him by a trusty hand to a cheap school in Yorkshire -- that she had paid for his education for some years , and then , being poor , and going a long way off , gradually deserted him , for which she prayed forgiveness ? ’
288805	288813	288815	288815	Ralph	208	‘ The school was Mr. Squeers ’s , ’
288817	288900	288815	288815	Ralph	208	‘ the boy was left there in the name of Smike ; every description was fully given , dates tally exactly with Mr. Squeers ’s books , Mr. Squeers is lodging with you at this time ; you have two other boys at his school : you communicated the whole discovery to him , he brought you to me as the person who had recommended to him the kidnapper of his child ; and I brought you here . Is that so ? ’
288901	288924	288926	288926	Snawley	232	‘ You talk like a good book , sir , that ’s got nothing in its inside but what ’s the truth , ’
288928	288936	288938	288938	Ralph	208	‘ This is your pocket - book , ’
288946	288987	288938	288938	Ralph	208	‘ the certificates of your first marriage and of the boy ’s birth , and your wife ’s two letters , and every other paper that can support these statements directly or by implication , are here , are they ? ’
288988	288992	289013	289014	these people	9772	‘ Every one of ‘
288997	288998	288995	288995	sir	714	’ ‘
289051	289052	289049	289049	you	208	’ ‘

289069	289082	289058	289058	myself	0	’ said Ralph , tossing the pocket - book upon the table . ‘
289120	289284	289099	289099	I	0	’ With these words Ralph sat down unbidden , and compressing his lips , which were for the moment slightly parted by a smile , folded his arms , and looked for the first time at his nephew . Nicholas , stung by the concluding taunt , darted an indignant glance at him ; but commanding himself as well as he could , entered upon a close examination of the documents , at which John Browdie assisted . There was nothing about them which could be called in question . The certificates were regularly signed as extracts from the parish books , the first letter had a genuine appearance of having been written and preserved for some years , the handwriting of the second tallied with it exactly , ( making proper allowance for its having been written by a person in extremity , ) and there were several other corroboratory scraps of entries and memoranda which it was equally difficult to question . ‘
289288	289301	289099	289099	I	0	’ whispered Kate , who had been looking anxiously over his shoulder , ‘
289314	289315	289316	289316	I	0	’ ‘
289321	289325	289316	289316	I	0	’ answered Nicholas . ‘
289332	289347	289328	289328	you	207	’ John scratched his head and shook it , but said nothing at all . ‘
289354	289364	289348	289348	You	207	’ said Ralph , addressing himself to Mrs Nickleby , ‘
289425	289426	289427	289427	You	207	’ ‘
289437	289447	289427	289427	You	207	’ said Nicholas , drawing his sister towards him . ‘
289451	289455	289449	289449	you	207	’ replied Ralph . ‘
289466	289467	289449	289449	you	207	’ ‘
289470	289474	289449	289449	you	207	’ said Squeers , ‘
289501	289534	289449	289449	you	207	‘ em a sneezing now , so that he blows the street door right open . What ’s the order of the day ? Is Master Snawley to come along with us ? ’
289535	289542	289544	289544	Smike	264	‘ No , no , no , ’
289554	289574	289584	289584	Snawley	232	‘ No . Pray , no . I will not go from you with him . No , no . ’
289575	289582	289584	289584	Snawley	232	‘ This is a cruel thing , ’
289593	289604	289584	289584	Snawley	232	‘ Do parents bring children into the world for this ? ’
289605	289616	289618	289619	John Browdie	202	‘ Do parents bring children into the world for THOT ? ’
289631	289636	289638	289639	that gentleman	8945	‘ Never you mind , ’
289646	289651	289653	289653	John	202	‘ Never I mind ! ’
289655	289688	289653	289653	John	202	‘ no , nor never nobody mind , say’st thou , schoolmeasther . It ’s nobody ’s minding that keeps sike men as thou afloat . Noo then , where be’est thou coomin ’
289697	289703	289711	289712	John Browdie	202	’ ower me , mun . ’

289900	289909	289894	289894	Nicholas	207	‘ have the goodness to follow your friend . ’
289910	289916	289918	289918	Snawley	232	‘ I want my son , ’
289920	289924	289926	289926	Nicholas	207	‘ Your son , ’
289928	289943	289926	289926	Nicholas	207	‘ chooses for himself . He chooses to remain here , and he shall . ’
289944	289952	289954	289954	Snawley	232	‘ You wo n’t give him up ? ’
289956	289983	289985	289985	Nicholas	207	‘ I would not give him up against his will , to be the victim of such brutality as that to which you would consign him , ’
289987	289997	289985	289985	Nicholas	207	‘ if he were a dog or a rat . ’
289998	290007	290009	290010	Mr. Squeers	203	‘ Knock that Nickleby down with a candlestick , ’
290016	290035	290009	290010	Mr. Squeers	203	‘ and bring out my hat , somebody , will you , unless he wants to steal it . ’
290036	290044	290046	290047	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ I am very sorry , indeed , ’
290086	290247	290067	290067	Kate	210	‘ I am very sorry , indeed , for all this . I really do n’t know what would be best to do , and that ’s the truth . Nicholas ought to be the best judge , and I hope he is . Of course , it ’s a hard thing to have to keep other people ’s children , though young Mr. Snawley is certainly as useful and willing as it ’s possible for anybody to be ; but , if it could be settled in any friendly manner -- if old Mr. Snawley , for instance , would settle to pay something certain for his board and lodging , and some fair arrangement was come to , so that we undertook to have fish twice a week , and a pudding twice , or a dumpling , or something of that sort -- I do think that it might be very satisfactory and pleasant for all parties . ’
290316	290321	290323	290323	Snawley	232	‘ You , sir , ’
290330	290362	290323	290323	Snawley	232	‘ are an unnatural , ungrateful , unlovable boy . You wo n’t let me love you when I want to . Wo n’t you come home , wo n’t you ? ’
290363	290370	290372	290372	Smike	264	‘ No , no , no , ’
290377	290383	290385	290385	Squeers	203	‘ He never loved nobody , ’
290391	290457	290385	290385	Squeers	203	‘ He never loved me ; he never loved Wackford , who is next door but one to a cherubim . How can you expect that he ’ll love his father ? He ’ll never love his father , he wo n’t . He do n’t know what it is to have a father . He do n’t understand it . It an’t in him . ’
290534	290540	290542	290542	Ralph	208	‘ Your romance , sir , ’
290549	290596	290542	290542	Ralph	208	‘ is destroyed , I take it . No unknown ; no persecuted descendant of a man of high degree ; but the weak , imbecile son of a poor , petty tradesman . We shall see how your sympathy melts before plain matter of fact . ’
290597	290601	290603	290603	Nicholas	207	‘ You shall , ’
290610	290617	290619	290619	Ralph	208	‘ And trust me , sir , ’
290621	290783	290619	290619	Ralph	208	‘ that I never supposed you would give him up tonight . Pride , obstinacy , reputation for fine feeling , were all against it . These must be brought down , sir , lowered , crushed , as they shall be soon . The protracted and wearing anxiety and expense of the law in its most oppressive form , its torture from hour to hour , its weary days and sleepless nights , with these I ’ll prove you , and break your haughty spirit , strong as you deem it now . And when you make this house a hell , and visit these trials upon yonder wretched object ( as you will ; I know you ) , and those who think you now a young - fledged hero , we ’ll go into old accounts between us two , and see who stands the debtor , and comes out best at last , even before the world . ’
291064	291078	291080	291080	Nicholas	207	‘ So deeply rooted does this horror of the man appear to be , ’
291082	291119	291080	291080	Nicholas	207	‘ that I can hardly believe he really is his son . Nature does not seem to have implanted in his breast one lingering feeling of affection for him , and surely she can never err . ’
291120	291125	291127	291128	brother Charles	489	‘ My dear sir , ’
291130	291305	291127	291128	brother Charles	489	‘ you fall into the very common mistake of charging upon Nature , matters with which she has not the smallest connection , and for which she is in no way responsible . Men talk of Nature as an abstract thing , and lose sight of what is natural while they do so . Here is a poor lad who has never felt a parent ’s care , who has scarcely known anything all his life but suffering and sorrow , presented to a man who he is told is his father , and whose first act is to signify his intention of putting an end to his short term of happiness , of consigning him to his old fate , and taking him from the only friend he has ever had -- which is yourself . If Nature , in such a case , put into that lad ’s breast but one secret prompting which urged him towards his father and away from you , she would be a liar and an idiot . ’
291338	291357	291359	291360	brother Charles	489	‘ The same mistake presents itself to me , in one shape or other , at every turn , ’
291362	291552	291359	291360	brother Charles	489	‘ Parents who never showed their love , complain of want of natural affection in their children ; children who never showed their duty , complain of want of natural feeling in their parents ; law - makers who find both so miserable that their affections have never had enough of life ’s sun to develop them , are loud in their moralisings over parents and children too , and cry that the very ties of nature are disregarded . Natural affections and instincts , my dear sir , are the most beautiful of the Almighty ’s works , but like other beautiful works of His , they must be reared and fostered , or it is as natural that they should be wholly obscured , and that new feelings should usurp their place , as it is that the sweetest productions of the earth , left untended , should be choked with weeds and briers . I wish we could be brought to consider this , and remembering natural obligations a little more at the right time , talk about them a little less at the wrong one . ’
291578	291615	291616	291616	Nicholas	207	‘ I dare say you are surprised , my dear sir , that I have listened to your recital with so little astonishment . That is easily explained . Your uncle has been here this morning . ’
291627	291630	291632	291634	the old gentleman	8480	‘ Yes , ’
291641	291681	291632	291634	the old gentleman	8480	‘ here , in this room . He would listen neither to reason , feeling , nor justice . But brother Ned was hard upon him ; brother Ned , sir , might have melted a paving - stone . ’
291682	291686	291688	291688	Nicholas	207	‘ He came to-- ’
291690	291696	291688	291688	Nicholas	207	‘ To complain of you , ’
291701	291787	291688	291688	Nicholas	207	‘ to poison our ears with calumnies and falsehoods ; but he came on a fruitless errand , and went away with some wholesome truths in his ear besides . Brother Ned , my dear Mr. Nickleby -- brother Ned , sir , is a perfect lion . So is Tim Linkinwater ; Tim is quite a lion . We had Tim in to face him at first , and Tim was at him , sir , before you could say “ Jack Robinson . ” ’
291788	291807	291809	291809	Nicholas	207	‘ How can I ever thank you for all the deep obligations you impose upon me every day ? ’
291811	291823	291809	291809	Nicholas	207	‘ By keeping silence upon the subject , my dear sir , ’
291828	291959	291960	291961	a barbarian	14197	‘ You shall be righted . At least you shall not be wronged . Nobody belonging to you shall be wronged . They shall not hurt a hair of your head , or the boy ’s head , or your mother ’s head , or your sister ’s head . I have said it , brother Ned has said it , Tim Linkinwater has said it . We have all said it , and we ’ll all do it . I have seen the father -- if he is the father -- and I suppose he must be . He is a barbarian and a hypocrite , Mr. Nickleby . I told him , “ You are a barbarian , sir . ” I did . I said , “ You ’re
291968	291989	292029	292029	his	489	’m glad of it , I am VERY glad I told him he was a barbarian , very glad indeed ! ’
292042	292053	292055	292057	the old gentleman	8480	‘ The subject is at an end for the present , ’
292063	292100	292055	292057	the old gentleman	8480	‘ Do n’t revive it by a single word . I am going to speak upon another subject , a confidential subject , Mr. Nickleby . We must be cool again , we must be cool . ’
292129	292148	292109	292109	he	8480	‘ I am about to employ you , my dear sir , on a confidential and delicate mission . ’
292149	292161	292163	292163	Nicholas	207	‘ You might employ many a more able messenger , sir , ’
292165	292186	292163	292163	Nicholas	207	‘ but a more trustworthy or zealous one , I may be bold to say , you could not find . ’
292187	292195	292109	292109	he	8480	‘ Of that I am well assured , ’
292200	292228	292197	292198	brother Charles	489	‘ well assured . You will give me credit for thinking so , when I tell you that the object of this mission is a young lady . ’
292229	292236	292238	292238	Nicholas	207	‘ A young lady , sir ! ’
292252	292259	292261	292262	Mr. Cheeryble	489	‘ A very beautiful young lady , ’
292266	292273	292275	292275	Nicholas	207	‘ Pray go on , sir , ’
292277	292286	292288	292289	brother Charles	12852	‘ I am thinking how to do so , ’
292309	292340	292288	292289	brother Charles	12852	‘ You accidentally saw a young lady in this room one morning , my dear sir , in a fainting fit . Do you remember ? Perhaps you have forgotten . ’
292341	292345	292347	292347	Nicholas	207	‘ Oh no , ’
292351	292362	292347	292347	Nicholas	207	‘ I -- I -- remember it very well indeed . ’
292363	292372	292374	292375	brother Charles	489	‘ SHE is the lady I speak of , ’
292396	292402	292404	292405	Mr. Cheeryble	489	‘ She is the daughter , ’
292407	292490	292404	292405	Mr. Cheeryble	489	‘ of a lady who , when she was a beautiful girl herself , and I was very many years younger , I -- it seems a strange word for me to utter now -- I loved very dearly . You will smile , perhaps , to hear a grey - headed man talk about such things . You will not offend me , for when I was as young as you , I dare say I should have done the same . ’
292491	292500	292502	292502	Nicholas	207	‘ I have no such inclination , indeed , ’
292504	292510	292512	292513	Mr. Cheeryble	489	‘ My dear brother Ned , ’
292515	292569	292512	292513	Mr. Cheeryble	489	‘ was to have married her sister , but she died . She is dead too now , and has been for many years . She married her choice ; and I wish I could add that her after - life was as happy as God knows I ever prayed it might be ! ’
292583	292627	292629	292631	the old gentleman	8480	‘ If trial and calamity had fallen as lightly on his head , as in the deepest truth of my own heart I ever hoped ( for her sake ) it would , his life would have been one of peace and happiness , ’
292634	292880	292881	292881	Nicholas	207	‘ It will be enough to say that this was not the case ; that she was not happy ; that they fell into complicated distresses and difficulties ; that she came , twelve months before her death , to appeal to my old friendship ; sadly changed , sadly altered , broken - spirited from suffering and ill - usage , and almost broken - hearted . He readily availed himself of the money which , to give her but one hour ’s peace of mind , I would have poured out as freely as water -- nay , he often sent her back for more -- and yet even while he squandered it , he made the very success of these , her applications to me , the groundwork of cruel taunts and jeers , protesting that he knew she thought with bitter remorse of the choice she had made , that she had married him from motives of interest and vanity ( he was a gay young man with great friends about him when she chose him for her husband ) , and venting in short upon her , by every unjust and unkind means , the bitterness of that ruin and disappointment which had been brought about by his profligacy alone . In those times this young lady was a mere child . I never saw her again until that morning when you saw her also , but my nephew , Frank-- ’
292897	292906	292908	292909	Mr. Cheeryble	481	‘ --My nephew , Frank , I say , ’
292911	293026	293028	293029	brother Charles	489	‘ encountered her by accident , and lost sight of her almost in a minute afterwards , within two days after he returned to England . Her father lay in some secret place to avoid his creditors , reduced , between sickness and poverty , to the verge of death , and she , a child,--we might almost think , if we did not know the wisdom of all Heaven ’s decrees -- who should have blessed a better man , was steadily braving privation , degradation , and everything most terrible to such a young and delicate creature ’s heart , for the purpose of supporting him . She was attended , sir , ’
293031	293095	293028	293029	brother Charles	489	‘ in these reverses , by one faithful creature , who had been , in old times , a poor kitchen wench in the family , who was then their solitary servant , but who might have been , for the truth and fidelity of her heart -- who might have been -- ah ! the wife of Tim Linkinwater himself , sir ! ’
293508	293515	293517	293518	brother Charles	489	‘ If I had been poor , ’
293524	293650	293517	293518	brother Charles	489	‘ if I had been poor , Mr. Nickleby , my dear sir , which thank God I am not , I would have denied myself ( of course anybody would under such circumstances ) the commonest necessaries of life , to help her . As it is , the task is a difficult one . If her father were dead , nothing could be easier , for then she should share and cheer the happiest home that brother Ned and I could have , as if she were our child or sister . But he is still alive . Nobody can help him ; that has been tried a thousand times ; he was not abandoned by all without good cause , I know . ’
293651	293658	293659	293659	Nicholas	207	‘ Can not she be persuaded to-- ’
293668	293673	293675	293676	brother Charles	489	‘ To leave him ? ’
293678	293716	293675	293676	brother Charles	489	‘ Who could entreat a child to desert her parent ? Such entreaties , limited to her seeing him occasionally , have been urged upon her -- not by me -- but always with the same result . ’
293717	293724	293726	293726	Nicholas	207	‘ Is he kind to her ? ’
293728	293735	293726	293726	Nicholas	207	‘ Does he requite her affection ? ’
293736	293752	293754	293755	Mr. Cheeryble	489	‘ True kindness , considerate self - denying kindness , is not in his nature , ’
293757	293835	293754	293755	Mr. Cheeryble	489	‘ Such kindness as he knows , he regards her with , I believe . The mother was a gentle , loving , confiding creature , and although he wounded her from their marriage till her death as cruelly and wantonly as ever man did , she never ceased to love him . She commended him on her death - bed to her child ’s care . Her child has never forgotten it , and never will . ’
293836	293844	293846	293846	Nicholas	207	‘ Have you no influence over him ? ’
293848	293938	293846	293846	Nicholas	207	‘ I , my dear sir ! The last man in the world . Such are his jealousy and hatred of me , that if he knew his daughter had opened her heart to me , he would render her life miserable with his reproaches ; although -- this is the inconsistency and selfishness of his character -- although if he knew that every penny she had came from me , he would not relinquish one personal desire that the most reckless expenditure of her scanty stock could gratify . ’
293939	293944	293946	293946	Nicholas	207	‘ An unnatural scoundrel ! ’
293950	293958	293960	293961	brother Charles	489	‘ We will use no harsh terms , ’
293968	294081	293960	293961	brother Charles	489	‘ but accommodate ourselves to the circumstances in which this young lady is placed . Such assistance as I have prevailed upon her to accept , I have been obliged , at her own earnest request , to dole out in the smallest portions , lest he , finding how easily money was procured , should squander it even more lightly than he is accustomed to do . She has come to and fro , to and fro , secretly and by night , to take even this ; and I can not bear that things should go on in this way , Mr Nickleby , I really can not bear it . ’
294215	294220	294222	294223	brother Charles	489	‘ He knows me , ’
294225	294386	294222	294223	brother Charles	489	‘ and he knows my brother Ned . Neither of us would do . Frank is a very good fellow -- a very fine fellow -- but we are afraid that he might be a little flighty and thoughtless in such a delicate matter , and that he might , perhaps -- that he might , in short , be too susceptible ( for she is a beautiful creature , sir ; just what her poor mother was ) , and falling in love with her before he knew well his own mind , carry pain and sorrow into that innocent breast , which we would be the humble instruments of gradually making happy . He took an extraordinary interest in her fortunes when he first happened to encounter her ; and we gather from the inquiries we have made of him , that it was she in whose behalf he made that turmoil which led to your first acquaintance . ’
294424	294431	294434	294434	Charles	489	‘ Well ; then you see , ’
294436	294630	294434	294434	Charles	489	‘ that HE would n’t do . Tim Linkinwater is out of the question ; for Tim , sir , is such a tremendous fellow , that he could never contain himself , but would go to loggerheads with the father before he had been in the place five minutes . You do n’t know what Tim is , sir , when he is aroused by anything that appeals to his feelings very strongly ; then he is terrific , sir , is Tim Linkinwater , absolutely terrific . Now , in you we can repose the strictest confidence ; in you we have seen -- or at least I have seen , and that ’s the same thing , for there ’s no difference between me and my brother Ned , except that he is the finest creature that ever lived , and that there is not , and never will be , anybody like him in all the world -- in you we have seen domestic virtues and affections , and delicacy of feeling , which exactly qualify you for such an office . And you are the man , sir . ’
294631	294638	294640	294640	Nicholas	207	‘ The young lady , sir , ’
294669	294670	294683	294683	she	6358	’ ‘
294675	294680	294683	294683	she	6358	’ returned Mr. Cheeryble ; ‘
294756	294917	294735	294735	she	6358	’ In this guileless and most kind simplicity , brother Charles was so happy , and in this possibility of the young lady being led to think that she was under no obligation to him , he evidently felt so sanguine and had so much delight , that Nicholas would not breathe a doubt upon the subject . All this time , however , there hovered upon the tip of his tongue a confession that the very same objections which Mr. Cheeryble had stated to the employment of his nephew in this commission applied with at least equal force and validity to himself , and a hundred times had he been upon the point of avowing the real state of his feelings , and entreating to be released from it . But as often , treading upon the heels of this impulse , came another which urged him to refrain , and to keep his secret to his own breast . ‘
294922	294926	294920	294920	I	0	’ thought Nicholas , ‘
295031	295045	295458	295458	he	6365	’ Asking himself such questions as these , Nicholas mentally answered with great emphasis ‘
295048	295200	295458	295458	he	6365	’ and persuading himself that he was a most conscientious and glorious martyr , nobly resolved to do what , if he had examined his own heart a little more carefully , he would have found he could not resist . Such is the sleight of hand by which we juggle with ourselves , and change our very weaknesses into stanch and most magnanimous virtues ! Mr. Cheeryble , being of course wholly unsuspicious that such reflections were presenting themselves to his young friend , proceeded to give him the needful credentials and directions for his first visit , which was to be made next morning ; and all preliminaries being arranged , and the strictest secrecy enjoined , Nicholas walked home for the night very thoughtfully indeed . The place to which Mr. Cheeryble had directed him was a row of mean and not over - cleanly houses , situated within ‘
295203	295445	295458	295458	he	6365	’ of the King ’s Bench Prison , and not many hundred paces distant from the obelisk in St George ’s Fields . The Rules are a certain liberty adjoining the prison , and comprising some dozen streets in which debtors who can raise money to pay large fees , from which their creditors do NOT derive any benefit , are permitted to reside by the wise provisions of the same enlightened laws which leave the debtor who can raise no money to starve in jail , without the food , clothing , lodging , or warmth , which are provided for felons convicted of the most atrocious crimes that can disgrace humanity . There are many pleasant fictions of the law in constant operation , but there is not one so pleasant or practically humorous as that which supposes every man to be of equal value in its impartial eye , and the benefits of all laws to be equally attainable by all men , without the smallest reference to the furniture of their pockets . To the row of houses indicated to him by Mr. Charles Cheeryble , Nicholas directed his steps , without much troubling his head with such matters as these ; and at this row of houses -- after traversing a very dirty and dusty suburb , of which minor theatricals , shell - fish , ginger - beer , spring vans , greengrocery , and brokers ’
296310	296336	296284	296284	he	8818	‘ Madeline , who is this ? What does anybody want here ? Who told a stranger we could be seen ? What is it ? ’
296337	296340	296347	296347	she	893	‘ I believe-- ’
296366	296371	296347	296347	she	893	‘ You always believe , ’
296378	296383	296347	296347	she	893	‘ What is it ? ’
296493	296503	296505	296506	the father	3399	‘ See that the money is right , Madeline , ’
296508	296516	296505	296506	the father	3399	‘ Open the paper , my dear . ’
296517	296526	296561	296561	you	893	‘ It ’s quite right , papa , I ’m
296529	296530	296561	296561	you	893	’ ‘
296533	296554	296561	296561	you	893	’ said Mr. Bray , putting out his hand , and opening and shutting his bony fingers with irritable impatience . ‘
296568	296590	296561	296561	you	893	’re sure ? How can you be sure of any such thing ? Five pounds -- well , is THAT right ? ’
296591	296594	296596	296596	Madeline	542	‘ Quite , ’
296631	296640	296642	296644	the sick man	13178	‘ Ring the bell , ring the bell , ’
296670	296748	296642	296644	the sick man	13178	‘ Tell her to get it changed , to get me a newspaper , to buy me some grapes , another bottle of the wine that I had last week -- and -- and -- I forget half I want just now , but she can go out again . Let her get those first , those first . Now , Madeline , my love , quick , quick ! Good God , how slow you are ! ’
296749	296757	296759	296759	Nicholas	207	‘ He remembers nothing that SHE wants ! ’
296795	296803	296805	296805	Nicholas	207	‘ It is no matter at all , ’
296807	296818	296805	296805	Nicholas	207	‘ No matter ! what do you mean , sir ? ’
296824	296929	296820	296822	the tart rejoinder	6404	‘ No matter ! Do you think you bring your paltry money here as a favour or a gift ; or as a matter of business , and in return for value received ? D -- n you , sir , because you ca n’t appreciate the time and taste which are bestowed upon the goods you deal in , do you think you give your money away ? Do you know that you are talking to a gentleman , sir , who at one time could have bought up fifty such men as you and all you have ? What do you mean ? ’
296930	296961	296963	296963	Nicholas	207	‘ I merely mean that as I shall have many dealings with this lady , if she will kindly allow me , I will not trouble her with such forms , ’
296965	296989	296963	296963	Nicholas	207	‘ Then I mean , if you please , that we ’ll have as many forms as we can , returned the father . ‘
297062	297131	297045	297045	Madeline	542	’ While she was feigning to write it , and Nicholas was ruminating upon the extraordinary but by no means uncommon character thus presented to his observation , the invalid , who appeared at times to suffer great bodily pain , sank back in his chair and moaned out a feeble complaint that the girl had been gone an hour , and that everybody conspired to goad him . ‘
297134	297146	297045	297045	Madeline	542	’ said Nicholas , as he took the piece of paper , ‘
297153	297167	297045	297045	Madeline	542	’ This was addressed to the daughter , but the father answered immediately . ‘
297170	297200	297286	297288	the young lady	893	’re requested to call , sir , and not before . Do n’t worry and persecute . Madeline , my dear , when is this person to call again ? ’
297201	297229	297231	297233	the young lady	893	‘ Oh , not for a long time , not for three or four weeks ; it is not necessary , indeed ; I can do without , ’
297239	297249	297257	297257	his	9254	‘ Why , how are we to do without ? ’
297260	297273	297257	297257	his	9254	‘ Three or four weeks , Madeline ! Three or four weeks ! ’
297274	297284	297286	297288	the young lady	893	‘ Then sooner , sooner , if you please , ’
297294	297300	297302	297303	the father	3399	‘ Three or four weeks ! ’
297305	297320	297302	297303	the father	3399	‘ Madeline , what on earth -- do nothing for three or four weeks ! ’
297321	297330	297332	297332	Nicholas	207	‘ It is a long time , ma’am , ’
297334	297342	297344	297345	the father	3399	‘ YOU think so , do you ? ’
297349	297416	297344	297345	the father	3399	‘ If I chose to beg , sir , and stoop to ask assistance from people I despise , three or four months would not be a long time ; three or four years would not be a long time . Understand , sir , that is if I chose to be dependent ; but as I do n’t , you may call in a week . ’
297518	297533	297535	297535	Madeline	542	‘ I do n’t know whether I do right in asking you , sir , ’
297539	297587	297535	297535	Madeline	542	‘ but pray , pray , do not mention to my poor mother ’s dear friends what has passed here today . He has suffered much , and is worse this morning . I beg you , sir , as a boon , a favour to myself . ’
297588	297597	297599	297599	Nicholas	207	‘ You have but to hint a wish , ’
297602	297613	297599	297599	Nicholas	207	‘ and I would hazard my life to gratify it . ’
297614	297621	297535	297535	Madeline	542	‘ You speak hastily , sir . ’
297622	297627	297629	297629	Nicholas	207	‘ Truly and sincerely , ’
297640	297708	297635	297635	he	6419	‘ if ever man spoke truly yet . I am not skilled in disguising my feelings , and if I were , I could not hide my heart from you . Dear madam , as I know your history , and feel as men and angels must who hear and see such things , I do entreat you to believe that I would die to serve you . ’
297722	297726	297728	297728	Nicholas	207	‘ Forgive me , ’
297734	297846	297728	297728	Nicholas	207	‘ if I seem to say too much , or to presume upon the confidence which has been intrusted to me . But I could not leave you as if my interest and sympathy expired with the commission of the day . I am your faithful servant , humbly devoted to you from this hour , devoted in strict truth and honour to him who sent me here , and in pure integrity of heart , and distant respect for you . If I meant more or less than this , I should be unworthy his regard , and false to the very nature that prompts the honest words I utter . ’
297910	297919	297921	297922	Newman Noggs	211	‘ There go the three - quarters past ! ’
297932	297959	297963	297963	his	211	‘ and my dinner time ’s two . He does it on purpose . He makes a point of it . It ’s just like him . ’
298000	298011	298013	298013	Newman	211	‘ I do n’t believe he ever had an appetite , ’
298015	298067	298013	298013	Newman	211	‘ except for pounds , shillings , and pence , and with them he ’s as greedy as a wolf . I should like to have him compelled to swallow one of every English coin . The penny would be an awkward morsel -- but the crown -- ha ! ha ! ’
298191	298197	298199	298199	Newman	211	‘ Five minutes to three , ’
298201	298312	298199	298199	Newman	211	‘ it ca n’t want more by this time ; and I had my breakfast at eight o’clock , and SUCH a breakfast ! and my right dinner - time two ! And I might have a nice little bit of hot roast meat spoiling at home all this time -- how does HE know I have n’t ? “ Do n’t go till I come back , ” “ Do n’t go till I come back , ” day after day . What do you always go out at my dinner - time for then -- eh ? Do n’t you know it ’s nothing but aggravation -- eh ? ’
298428	298433	298435	298435	Newman	211	‘ Here he is , ’
298437	298465	298435	298435	Newman	211	‘ and somebody with him . Now it ’ll be “ Stop till this gentleman ’s gone . ” But I wo n’t . That ’s flat . ’
298501	298504	298506	298506	Ralph	208	‘ Noggs ! ’
298508	298516	298506	298506	Ralph	208	‘ where is that fellow , Noggs ? ’
298524	298539	298541	298541	Ralph	208	‘ The dog has gone to his dinner , though I told him not , ’
298554	298557	298541	298541	Ralph	208	‘ Humph ! ’
298597	298598	298603	298604	Mr. Nickleby	208	’ ‘
298631	298978	298603	298604	Mr. Nickleby	208	’ The parson who made this reply was a little old man , of about seventy or seventy - five years of age , of a very lean figure , much bent and slightly twisted . He wore a grey coat with a very narrow collar , an old - fashioned waistcoat of ribbed black silk , and such scanty trousers as displayed his shrunken spindle - shanks in their full ugliness . The only articles of display or ornament in his dress were a steel watch - chain to which were attached some large gold seals ; and a black ribbon into which , in compliance with an old fashion scarcely ever observed in these days , his grey hair was gathered behind . His nose and chin were sharp and prominent , his jaws had fallen inwards from loss of teeth , his face was shrivelled and yellow , save where the cheeks were streaked with the colour of a dry winter apple ; and where his beard had been , there lingered yet a few grey tufts which seemed , like the ragged eyebrows , to denote the badness of the soil from which they sprung . The whole air and attitude of the form was one of stealthy cat - like obsequiousness ; the whole expression of the face was concentrated in a wrinkled leer , compounded of cunning , lecherousness , slyness , and avarice . Such was old Arthur Gride , in whose face there was not a wrinkle , in whose dress there was not one spare fold or plait , but expressed the most covetous and griping penury , and sufficiently indicated his belonging to that class of which Ralph Nickleby was a member . Such was old Arthur Gride , as he sat in a low chair looking up into the face of Ralph Nickleby , who , lounging upon the tall office stool , with his arms upon his knees , looked down into his ; a match for him on whatever errand he had come . ‘
298985	298999	299000	299000	I	0	’ said Gride , feigning great interest in Ralph ’s state of health . ‘
299011	299012	298603	298604	Mr. Nickleby	208	’ ‘
299019	299049	298603	298604	Mr. Nickleby	208	’ said Ralph , with a peculiar smile , importing that he very well knew it was not on a mere visit of compliment that his friend had come . ‘
299077	299078	299062	299062	I	0	’ ‘
299084	299088	299079	299079	I	0	’ observed Gride . ‘
299093	299139	299090	299090	men	8646	’ replied Ralph , drily . The older money - lender wagged his chin and smiled , but he originated no new remark , and they sat for some little time without speaking . Each was looking out to take the other at a disadvantage . ‘
299144	299151	299142	299142	Gride	548	’ said Ralph , at length ; ‘
299159	299160	299142	299142	Gride	548	’ ‘
299164	299172	299174	299175	the other	8439	’re a bold man , Mr. Nickleby , ’
299190	299203	299174	299175	the other	8439	‘ Oh dear , dear , what a bold man you are ! ’
299204	299224	299226	299226	Ralph	208	‘ Why , you have a sleek and slinking way with you that makes me seem so by contrast , ’
299228	299248	299226	299226	Ralph	208	‘ I do n’t know but that yours may answer better , but I want the patience for it . ’
299249	299259	299261	299262	old Arthur	548	‘ You were born a genius , Mr. Nickleby , ’
299264	299273	299261	299262	old Arthur	548	‘ Deep , deep , deep . Ah ! ’
299274	299278	299280	299280	Ralph	208	‘ Deep enough , ’

299825	299866	299817	299817	Ralph	208	‘ that for some purpose of your own you told a lie , and that it was n’t the first time and would n’t be the last ; that I was n’t surprised and was n’t to be taken in . ’
299867	299877	299879	299880	old Arthur	548	‘ Then I tell you seriously that I am , ’

299938	299997	299935	299936	Arthur Gride	548	‘ I could n’t do it , I should be mad to try . I , I , to deceive Mr. Nickleby ! The pigmy to impose upon the giant . I ask again -- he , he , he!--what should you say to me if I was to tell you that I was going to be married ? ’
299998	300004	300006	300006	Ralph	208	‘ To some old hag ? ’

Dark eyes , long eyelashes , ripe and ruddy lips that to look at is to long to kiss , beautiful clustering hair that one ’s fingers itch to play with , such a waist as might make a man clasp the air involuntarily , thinking of twining his arm about it , little feet that tread so lightly they hardly seem to walk upon the ground -- to marry all this , sir , this -- hey , hey ! ’
300145	300154	300156	300156	Ralph	208	‘ This is something more than common drivelling , ’

300238	300248	300250	300250	Ralph	208	‘ Why , who the devil should there be ? ’
300254	300272	300274	300275	Arthur Gride	548	‘ I did n’t know but that perhaps somebody might be passing up or down the stairs , ’
300288	300324	300274	300275	Arthur Gride	548	‘ or but that your man might have come back and might have been listening outside . Clerks and servants have a trick of listening , and I should have been very uncomfortable if Mr. Noggs-- ’

300336	300347	300332	300332	Ralph	208	‘ and go on with what you have to say . ’

300395	300400	300359	300360	old Arthur	548	‘ what is it ? ’
300401	300405	300359	300360	old Arthur	548	‘ Madeline Bray . ’
300471	300474	300476	300476	Ralph	208	‘ Bray , ’
300478	300495	300476	300476	Ralph	208	‘ Bray -- there was young Bray of -- no , he never had a daughter . ’
300496	300501	300503	300504	Arthur Gride	548	‘ You remember Bray ? ’
300506	300509	300511	300511	Ralph	208	‘ No , ’
300518	300535	300511	300511	Ralph	208	‘ Not Walter Bray ! The dashing man , who used his handsome wife so ill ? ’
300536	300556	300558	300558	Ralph	208	‘ If you seek to recall any particular dashing man to my recollection by such a trait as that , ’
300564	300582	300558	300558	Ralph	208	‘ I shall confound him with nine - tenths of the dashing men I have ever known . ’
300583	300600	300602	300603	old Arthur	548	‘ Tut , tut . That Bray who is now in the Rules of the Bench , ’
300605	300628	300602	300603	old Arthur	548	‘ You ca n’t have forgotten Bray . Both of us did business with him . Why , he owes you money ! ’
300629	300633	300635	300635	Ralph	208	‘ Oh HIM ! ’
300637	300656	300635	300635	Ralph	208	‘ Ay , ay . Now you speak . Oh ! It ’s HIS daughter , is it ? ’
300753	300771	300772	300772	he	548	‘ I knew you could n’t forget him , when you came to think for a moment , ’
300775	300780	300772	300772	he	548	‘ You were right , ’
300784	300978	300772	300772	he	548	‘ But old Arthur Gride and matrimony is a most anomalous conjunction of words ; old Arthur Gride and dark eyes and eyelashes , and lips that to look at is to long to kiss , and clustering hair that he wants to play with , and waists that he wants to span , and little feet that do n’t tread upon anything -- old Arthur Gride and such things as these is more monstrous still ; but old Arthur Gride marrying the daughter of a ruined “ dashing man ” in the Rules of the Bench , is the most monstrous and incredible of all . Plainly , friend Arthur Gride , if you want any help from me in this business ( which of course you do , or you would not be here ) , speak out , and to the purpose . And , above all , do n’t talk to me of its turning to my advantage , for I know it must turn to yours also , and to a good round tune too , or you would have no finger in such a pie as this . ’

301329	301332	301334	301334	Gride	548	‘ Now , ’
301336	301392	301334	301334	Gride	548	‘ for the little plan I have in my mind to bring this about ; because , I have n’t offered myself even to the father yet , I should have told you . But that you have gathered already ? Ah ! oh dear , oh dear , what an edged tool you are ! ’
301393	301401	301403	301403	Ralph	208	‘ Do n’t play with me then , ’
301406	301412	301403	301403	Ralph	208	‘ You know the proverb . ’
301413	301424	301426	301427	old Arthur	548	‘ A reply always on the tip of his tongue ! ’

301477	301540	301473	301473	he	548	‘ I have been backwards and forwards to Bray ’s lodgings several times within the last six months . It is just half a year since I first saw this delicate morsel , and , oh dear , what a delicate morsel it is ! But that is neither here nor there . I am his detaining creditor for seventeen hundred pounds ! ’
301541	301553	301555	301555	Ralph	208	‘ You talk as if you were the only detaining creditor , ’
301564	301580	301555	301555	Ralph	208	‘ I am another for nine hundred and seventy - five pounds four and threepence . ’

301596	301716	301591	301592	old Arthur	548	‘ The only other . Nobody else went to the expense of lodging a detainer , trusting to our holding him fast enough , I warrant you . We both fell into the same snare ; oh dear , what a pitfall it was ; it almost ruined me ! And lent him our money upon bills , with only one name besides his own , which to be sure everybody supposed to be a good one , and was as negotiable as money , but which turned out you know how . Just as we should have come upon him , he died insolvent . Ah ! it went very nigh to ruin me , that loss did ! ’
301717	301724	301726	301726	Ralph	208	‘ Go on with your scheme , ’
301728	301750	301726	301726	Ralph	208	‘ It ’s of no use raising the cry of our trade just now ; there ’s nobody to hear us ! ’
301751	301762	301764	301765	old Arthur	548	‘ It ’s always as well to talk that way , ’
301771	301956	301764	301765	old Arthur	548	‘ whether there ’s anybody to hear us or not . Practice makes perfect , you know . Now , if I offer myself to Bray as his son - in - law , upon one simple condition that the moment I am fast married he shall be quietly released , and have an allowance to live just t’other side the water like a gentleman ( he ca n’t live long , for I have asked his doctor , and he declares that his complaint is one of the Heart and it is impossible ) , and if all the advantages of this condition are properly stated and dwelt upon to him , do you think he could resist me ? And if he could not resist ME , do you think his daughter could resist HIM ? Should n’t I have her Mrs. Arthur Gride -- pretty Mrs. Arthur Gride -- a tit - bit -- a dainty chick -- shouldn’t I have her Mrs. Arthur Gride in a week , a month , a day -- any time I chose to name ? ’
301957	301961	301963	301963	Ralph	208	‘ Go on , ’
301994	302008	301764	301765	old Arthur	548	‘ Go on . You did n’t come here to ask me that . ’
302009	302017	302019	302020	old Arthur	548	‘ Oh dear , how you talk ! ’
302029	302124	302023	302023	himself	548	‘ Of course I did n’t , I do n’t pretend I did ! I came to ask what you would take from me , if I prospered with the father , for this debt of yours . Five shillings in the pound , six and - eightpence , ten shillings ? I WOULD go as far as ten for such a friend as you , we have always been on such good terms , but you wo n’t be so hard upon me as that , I know . Now , will you ? ’
302125	302134	302136	302136	Ralph	208	‘ There ’s something more to be told , ’
302145	302161	302136	302136	Ralph	208	‘ Yes , yes , there is , but you wo n’t give me time , ’
302166	302249	302136	302136	Ralph	208	‘ I want a backer in this matter ; one who can talk , and urge , and press a point , which you can do as no man can . I ca n’t do that , for I am a poor , timid , nervous creature . Now , if you get a good composition for this debt , which you long ago gave up for lost , you ’ll stand my friend , and help me . Wo n’t you ? ’
302250	302256	302258	302258	Ralph	208	‘ There ’s something more , ’
302260	302267	302269	302270	Arthur Gride	548	‘ No , no , indeed , ’
302272	302284	302286	302286	Ralph	208	‘ Yes , yes , indeed . I tell you yes , ’
302288	302291	302286	302286	Ralph	208	‘ Oh ! ’
302301	302325	302293	302294	old Arthur	548	‘ You mean something more , as concerns myself and my intention . Ay , surely , surely . Shall I mention that ? ’
302326	302333	302335	302335	Ralph	208	‘ I think you had better , ’
302339	302365	302367	302368	Arthur Gride	548	‘ I did n’t like to trouble you with that , because I supposed your interest would cease with your own concern in the affair , ’
302370	302448	302367	302368	Arthur Gride	548	‘ That ’s kind of you to ask . Oh dear , how very kind of you ! Why , supposing I had a knowledge of some property -- some little property -- very little -- to which this pretty chick was entitled ; which nobody does or can know of at this time , but which her husband could sweep into his pouch , if he knew as much as I do , would that account for-- ’
302449	302455	302457	302457	Ralph	208	‘ For the whole proceeding , ’
302461	302486	302457	302457	Ralph	208	‘ Now , let me turn this matter over , and consider what I ought to have if I should help you to success . ’
302487	302494	302496	302497	old Arthur	548	‘ But do n’t be hard , ’
302515	302558	302500	302500	his	548	‘ Do n’t be too hard upon me . It ’s a very small property , it is indeed . Say the ten shillings , and we ’ll close the bargain . It ’s more than I ought to give , but you ’re
302573	302634	302563	302563	we	6470	’ Ralph took no notice of these supplications , but sat for three or four minutes in a brown study , looking thoughtfully at the person from whom they proceeded . After sufficient cogitation he broke silence , and it certainly could not be objected that he used any needless circumlocution , or failed to speak directly to the purpose . ‘
302643	302647	302563	302563	we	6470	’ said Ralph , ‘
302859	303109	303110	303110	I	0	’ To all entreaties , protestations , and offers of compromise between his own proposals and those which Arthur Gride had first suggested , Ralph was deaf as an adder . He would enter into no further discussion of the subject , and while old Arthur dilated upon the enormity of his demands and proposed modifications of them , approaching by degrees nearer and nearer to the terms he resisted , sat perfectly mute , looking with an air of quiet abstraction over the entries and papers in his pocket - book . Finding that it was impossible to make any impression upon his staunch friend , Arthur Gride , who had prepared himself for some such result before he came , consented with a heavy heart to the proposed treaty , and upon the spot filled up the bond required ( Ralph kept such instruments handy ) , after exacting the condition that Mr. Nickleby should accompany him to Bray ’s lodgings that very hour , and open the negotiation at once , should circumstances appear auspicious and favourable to their designs . In pursuance of this last understanding the worthy gentlemen went out together shortly afterwards , and Newman Noggs emerged , bottle in hand , from the cupboard , out of the upper door of which , at the imminent risk of detection , he had more than once thrust his red nose when such parts of the subject were under discussion as interested him most . ‘
303116	303127	303110	303110	I	0	’ said Newman , putting the flask in his pocket . ‘
303134	303163	303128	303128	I	0	’ Having delivered this observation in a very grievous and doleful tone , Newman reached the door in one long limp , and came back again in another . ‘
303179	303183	303175	303175	she	6474	’ he said : ‘
303276	303422	303424	303424	he	548	’ With these reflections , and a very hard knock on the crown of his unfortunate hat at each repetition of the last word , Newman Noggs , whose brain was a little muddled by so much of the contents of the pocket - pistol as had found their way there during his recent concealment , went forth to seek such consolation as might be derivable from the beef and greens of some cheap eating - house . Meanwhile the two plotters had betaken themselves to the same house whither Nicholas had repaired for the first time but a few mornings before , and having obtained access to Mr. Bray , and found his daughter from home , had by a train of the most masterly approaches that Ralph ’s utmost skill could frame , at length laid open the real object of their visit . ‘
303430	303458	303424	303424	he	548	’ said Ralph , as the invalid , not yet recovered from his surprise , reclined in his chair , looking alternately at him and Arthur Gride . ‘

303562	303568	303560	303560	sir	714	’ returned Bray , haughtily , ‘

303604	303618	303600	303600	I	0	’ said the artful Ralph , turning to his friend , old Arthur . ‘
303683	303684	303691	303691	they	6490	’ ‘
303694	303711	303691	303691	they	6490	’ added Arthur Gride , leering hideously at the father - in - law he wanted . ‘
303726	303727	303691	303691	they	6490	’ ‘
303734	303750	303731	303732	Mr. Bray	543	’ said Ralph , hastily substituting for this argument considerations more nearly allied to earth , ‘
303769	303770	303731	303732	Mr. Bray	543	’ ‘
303778	303796	303731	303732	Mr. Bray	543	’ interrupted Mr. Bray , with an irritable consciousness that it really rested with him to decide . ‘
303817	303818	303813	303813	You	543	’ ‘
303821	303827	303813	303813	You	543	’ said Ralph , emphatically ; ‘
303850	303851	303829	303829	you	543	’ ‘
303859	303876	303857	303857	sir	714	’ returned the debtor , proud and mean by turns , and selfish at all times . ‘
304030	304031	304026	304026	I	0	’ ‘
304035	304052	304026	304026	I	0	’ returned Ralph , who thoroughly knew his man , and had taken his ground accordingly ; ‘
304083	304084	304060	304060	I	0	’ ‘
304092	304102	304060	304060	I	0	’ retorted Mr. Bray , in an exasperated tone . ‘
304155	304156	304173	304173	you	714	’ ‘
304159	304172	304173	304173	you	714	’ rejoined Ralph , as mildly as his nature would allow him , ‘
304298	304359	304360	304361	Mr. Bray	543	’ cost , instead of letting others live at yours . What is there on the reverse side of the picture ? What is there ? I do n’t know which is the nearest churchyard , but a gravestone there , wherever it is , and a date , perhaps two years hence , perhaps twenty . That ’s all . ’
304380	304385	304387	304387	Ralph	208	‘ I speak plainly , ’
304394	304489	304387	304387	Ralph	208	‘ because I feel strongly . It ’s my interest that you should marry your daughter to my friend Gride , because then he sees me paid -- in part , that is . I do n’t disguise it . I acknowledge it openly . But what interest have you in recommending her to such a step ? Keep that in view . She might object , remonstrate , shed tears , talk of his being too old , and plead that her life would be rendered miserable . But what is it now ? ’

Let me hear it stated . What is it ? That her suitor is an old man ? Why , how often do men of family and fortune , who have n’t your excuse , but have all the means and superfluities of life within their reach , how often do they marry their daughters to old men , or ( worse still ) to young men without heads or hearts , to tickle some idle vanity , strengthen some family interest , or secure some seat in Parliament ! Judge for her , sir , judge for her . You must know best , and she will live to thank you . ’

305102	305128	305308	305309	Mr. Bray	543	‘ But you had that spasm yesterday , and it is terrible to see you in such pain . Can I do nothing for you ? ’
305129	305154	305156	305157	Mr. Bray	543	‘ Nothing just now . Here are two gentlemen , Madeline , one of whom you have seen before . She used to say , ’
305163	305229	305156	305157	Mr. Bray	543	‘ that the sight of you always made me worse . That was natural , knowing what she did , and only what she did , of our connection and its results . Well , well . Perhaps she may change her mind on that point ; girls have leave to change their minds , you know . You are very tired , my dear . ’
305230	305237	305156	305157	Mr. Bray	543	‘ I am not , indeed . ’
305238	305248	305156	305157	Mr. Bray	543	‘ Indeed you are . You do too much . ’
305249	305257	305156	305157	Mr. Bray	543	‘ I wish I could do more . ’
305258	305299	305156	305157	Mr. Bray	543	‘ I know you do , but you overtask your strength . This wretched life , my love , of daily labour and fatigue , is more than you can bear , I am sure it is . Poor Madeline ! ’
305347	305355	305357	305357	Ralph	208	‘ You will communicate with us again ? ’
305359	305364	305366	305367	Mr. Bray	543	‘ Yes , yes , ’
305375	305385	305366	305367	Mr. Bray	543	‘ In a week . Give me a week . ’

305642	305656	305639	305640	Arthur Gride	548	‘ He hopes and fears . But is she not a dainty morsel ? ’
305657	305666	305668	305668	Ralph	208	‘ I have no great taste for beauty , ’
305670	305675	305677	305677	Arthur	548	‘ But I have , ’
305683	305717	305677	305677	Arthur	548	‘ Oh dear ! How handsome her eyes looked when she was stooping over him ! Such long lashes , such delicate fringe ! She -- she -- looked at me so soft . ’
305718	305727	305729	305729	Ralph	208	‘ Not over - lovingly , I think , ’

305748	305767	305768	305768	Ralph	208	‘ But do n’t you think it can be brought about ? Do n’t you think it can ? ’
305788	305808	305768	305768	Ralph	208	‘ Did you mark his telling her she was tired and did too much , and overtasked her strength ? ’
305809	305818	305768	305768	Ralph	208	‘ Ay , ay . What of it ? ’
305819	305851	305768	305768	Ralph	208	‘ When do you think he ever told her that before ? The life is more than she can bear . Yes , yes . He ’ll change it for her . ’
305852	305859	305861	305862	old Arthur	548	‘ D’ye think it ’s done ? ’
305876	305884	305886	305886	Ralph	208	‘ I am sure it ’s done , ’
305888	305981	305886	305886	Ralph	208	‘ He is trying to deceive himself , even before our eyes , already . He is making believe that he thinks of her good and not his own . He is acting a virtuous part , and so considerate and affectionate , sir , that the daughter scarcely knew him . I saw a tear of surprise in her eye . There ’ll be a few more tears of surprise there before long , though of a different kind . Oh ! we may wait with confidence for this day week . ’
306254	306269	306271	306271	Nicholas	207	‘ I will keep my word , as I have pledged it to her , ’
306275	306323	306271	306271	Nicholas	207	‘ This is no common trust that I have to discharge , and I will perform the double duty that is imposed upon me most scrupulously and strictly . My secret feelings deserve no consideration in such a case as this , and they shall have none . ’

306934	306943	306945	306945	Nicholas	207	‘ Surely it must be the same man , ’
306947	306956	306945	306945	Nicholas	207	‘ There ca n’t be two Vincent Crummleses . ’

307186	307197	307199	307199	Crummles	386	‘ You were always a favourite of hers , Johnson , ’
307201	307252	307199	307199	Crummles	386	‘ always were from the first . I was quite easy in my mind about you from that first day you dined with us . One that Mrs. Crummles took a fancy to , was sure to turn out right . Ah ! Johnson , what a woman that is ! ’
307253	307270	307272	307272	Nicholas	207	‘ I am sincerely obliged to her for her kindness in this and all other respects , ’
307274	307288	307272	307272	Nicholas	207	‘ But where are you going , that you talk about bidding goodbye ? ’
307289	307299	307301	307301	Crummles	386	‘ Have n’t you seen it in the papers ? ’
307307	307310	307312	307312	Nicholas	207	‘ No , ’
307314	307320	307322	307323	the manager	3395	‘ I wonder at that , ’
307325	307353	307322	307323	the manager	3395	‘ It was among the varieties . I had the paragraph here somewhere -- but I do n’t know -- oh , yes , here it is . ’
307422	307517	307418	307418	Nicholas	207	‘ The talented Vincent Crummles , long favourably known to fame as a country manager and actor of no ordinary pretensions , is about to cross the Atlantic on a histrionic expedition . Crummles is to be accompanied , we hear , by his lady and gifted family . We know no man superior to Crummles in his particular line of character , or one who , whether as a public or private individual , could carry with him the best wishes of a larger circle of friends . Crummles is certain to succeed . ’
307518	307524	307526	307527	Mr. Crummles	427	‘ Here ’s another bit , ’
307536	307548	307549	307549	Nicholas	207	‘ This is from the notices to correspondents , this one . ’
307554	307600	307602	307602	Nicholas	207	‘ “ Philo - Dramaticus . Crummles , the country manager and actor , can not be more than forty - three , or forty - four years of age . Crummles is NOT a Prussian , having been born at Chelsea . ” Humph ! ’
307604	307611	307602	307602	Nicholas	207	‘ that ’s an odd paragraph . ’
307612	307615	307617	307617	Crummles	386	‘ Very , ’
307637	307652	307655	307655	his	427	‘ I ca n’t think who puts these things in . I did n’t . ’
307707	307716	307718	307718	Nicholas	207	‘ I am astonished to hear this news , ’
307720	307738	307718	307718	Nicholas	207	‘ Going to America ! You had no such thing in contemplation when I was with you . ’
307739	307742	307744	307744	Crummles	427	‘ No , ’
307746	307765	307744	307744	Crummles	427	‘ I had n’t then . The fact is that Mrs Crummles -- most extraordinary woman , Johnson . ’
307777	307780	307782	307782	Nicholas	207	‘ Oh ! ’
307786	307796	307782	307782	Nicholas	207	‘ The prospect of an addition to your family ? ’
307797	307804	307806	307807	Mr. Crummles	427	‘ The seventh addition , Johnson , ’
307811	307842	307782	307782	Nicholas	207	‘ I thought such a child as the Phenomenon must have been a closer ; but it seems we are to have another . She is a very remarkable woman . ’
307843	307848	307850	307850	Nicholas	207	‘ I congratulate you , ’
307852	307863	307850	307850	Nicholas	207	‘ and I hope this may prove a phenomenon too . ’
307864	307879	307881	307882	Mr. Crummles	427	‘ Why , it ’s pretty sure to be something uncommon , I suppose , ’
307884	307987	307989	307989	himself	427	‘ The talent of the other three is principally in combat and serious pantomime . I should like this one to have a turn for juvenile tragedy ; I understand they want something of that sort in America very much . However , we must take it as it comes . Perhaps it may have a genius for the tight - rope . It may have any sort of genius , in short , if it takes after its mother , Johnson , for she is an universal genius ; but , whatever its genius is , that genius shall be developed . ’
308594	308601	308603	308604	Mr. Crummles	427	‘ Timberry wo n’t be long , ’
308606	308635	308603	308604	Mr. Crummles	427	‘ He played the audience out tonight . He does a faithful black in the last piece , and it takes him a little longer to wash himself . ’
308636	308648	308650	308650	Nicholas	207	‘ A very unpleasant line of character , I should think ? ’
308652	308660	308650	308650	Nicholas	207	‘ No , I do n’t know , ’
308665	308733	308662	308663	Mr. Crummles	427	‘ it comes off easily enough , and there ’s only the face and neck . We had a first - tragedy man in our company once , who , when he played Othello , used to black himself all over . But that ’s feeling a part and going into it as if you meant it ; it is n’t usual ; more ’s the pity . ’
308788	308802	308804	308804	Nicholas	207	‘ I see by the bills that you have been ill , sir , ’
308809	308822	308804	308804	Nicholas	207	‘ I hope you are none the worse for your exertions tonight ? ’
308857	308867	308848	308848	his	552	‘ But no matter , no matter . Come ! ’
309066	309079	309081	309082	Mrs. Crummles	386	‘ Why this is indeed a joy I had not looked for ! ’
309089	309093	309095	309095	Nicholas	207	‘ Nor I , ’
309097	309128	309095	309095	Nicholas	207	‘ It is by a mere chance that I have this opportunity of seeing you , although I would have made a great exertion to have availed myself of it . ’
309129	309137	309139	309140	Mrs. Crummles	386	‘ Here is one whom you know , ’
309161	309169	309139	309140	Mrs. Crummles	386	‘ and here another -- and another , ’
309175	309186	309095	309095	Nicholas	207	‘ And how is your friend , the faithful Digby ? ’
309187	309190	309192	309192	Nicholas	207	‘ Digby ! ’
309207	309225	309095	309095	Nicholas	207	‘ Oh yes . He ’s quite -- what am I saying?--he is very far from well . ’
309226	309229	309231	309232	Mrs. Crummles	386	‘ How ! ’
309239	309243	309245	309245	Nicholas	207	‘ I fear , ’
309258	309274	309248	309248	his	6588	‘ that your better - half would be more struck with him now than ever . ’
309275	309280	309286	309286	her	386	‘ What mean you ? ’
309291	309298	309286	309286	her	386	‘ Whence comes this altered tone ? ’
309299	309345	309350	309350	himself	207	‘ I mean that a dastardly enemy of mine has struck at me through him , and that while he thinks to torture me , he inflicts on him such agonies of terror and suspense as -- You will excuse me , I am sure , ’
309352	309380	309350	309350	himself	207	‘ I should never speak of this , and never do , except to those who know the facts , but for a moment I forgot myself . ’
309680	309693	309695	309695	Nicholas	207	‘ I am happy to know a gentleman of such great distinction , ’

309714	309745	309704	309705	the wit	6608	’m sure . The honour is reciprocal , sir , as I usually say when I dramatise a book . Did you ever hear a definition of fame , sir ? ’
309746	309752	309754	309754	Nicholas	207	‘ I have heard several , ’
309760	309765	309754	309754	Nicholas	207	‘ What is yours ? ’
309766	309775	309777	309779	the literary gentleman	6609	‘ When I dramatise a book , sir , ’

309857	309863	309864	309864	Shakespeare	415	’ answered the literary gentleman . ‘
309878	309882	309864	309864	Shakespeare	415	’ observed Nicholas . ‘

309977	309983	309985	309987	the literary gentleman	6609	’re quite right , sir , ’
309999	310017	309985	309987	the literary gentleman	6609	‘ Human intellect , sir , has progressed since his time , is progressing , will progress . ’
310018	310026	310028	310028	Nicholas	207	‘ Shot beyond him , I mean , ’
310030	310327	310028	310028	Nicholas	207	‘ in quite another respect , for , whereas he brought within the magic circle of his genius , traditions peculiarly adapted for his purpose , and turned familiar things into constellations which should enlighten the world for ages , you drag within the magic circle of your dulness , subjects not at all adapted to the purposes of the stage , and debase as he exalted . For instance , you take the uncompleted books of living authors , fresh from their hands , wet from the press , cut , hack , and carve them to the powers and capacities of your actors , and the capability of your theatres , finish unfinished works , hastily and crudely vamp up ideas not yet worked out by their original projector , but which have doubtless cost him many thoughtful days and sleepless nights ; by a comparison of incidents and dialogue , down to the very last word he may have written a fortnight before , do your utmost to anticipate his plot -- all this without his permission , and against his will ; and then , to crown the whole proceeding , publish in some mean pamphlet , an unmeaning farrago of garbled extracts from his work , to which your name as author , with the honourable distinction annexed , of having perpetrated a hundred other outrages of the same description . Now , show me the distinction between such pilfering as this , and picking a man ’s pocket in the street : unless , indeed , it be , that the legislature has a regard for pocket - handkerchiefs , and leaves men ’s brains , except when they are knocked out by violence , to take care of themselves . ’
310328	310335	310337	310339	the literary gentleman	6609	‘ Men must live , sir , ’
310345	310357	310359	310359	Nicholas	207	‘ That would be an equally fair plea in both cases , ’
310361	310436	310359	310359	Nicholas	207	‘ but if you put it upon that ground , I have nothing more to say , than , that if I were a writer of books , and you a thirsty dramatist , I would rather pay your tavern score for six months , large as it might be , than have a niche in the Temple of Fame with you for the humblest corner of my pedestal , through six hundred generations . ’
310628	310633	310614	310614	their	6627	‘ Now , Tim , ’

311418	312634	312635	312635	He	6653	’ Nicholas submitted to another hug with even a better grace than before , if that were possible , and waving his hat as cheerfully as he could , took farewell of the Vincent Crummleses . CHAPTER 49 Chronicles the further Proceedings of the Nickleby Family , and the Sequel of the Adventure of the Gentleman in the Small - clothes While Nicholas , absorbed in the one engrossing subject of interest which had recently opened upon him , occupied his leisure hours with thoughts of Madeline Bray , and in execution of the commissions which the anxiety of brother Charles in her behalf imposed upon him , saw her again and again , and each time with greater danger to his peace of mind and a more weakening effect upon the lofty resolutions he had formed , Mrs. Nickleby and Kate continued to live in peace and quiet , agitated by no other cares than those which were connected with certain harassing proceedings taken by Mr. Snawley for the recovery of his son , and their anxiety for Smike himself , whose health , long upon the wane , began to be so much affected by apprehension and uncertainty as sometimes to occasion both them and Nicholas considerable uneasiness , and even alarm . It was no complaint or murmur on the part of the poor fellow himself that thus disturbed them . Ever eager to be employed in such slight services as he could render , and always anxious to repay his benefactors with cheerful and happy looks , less friendly eyes might have seen in him no cause for any misgiving . But there were times , and often too , when the sunken eye was too bright , the hollow cheek too flushed , the breath too thick and heavy in its course , the frame too feeble and exhausted , to escape their regard and notice . There is a dread disease which so prepares its victim , as it were , for death ; which so refines it of its grosser aspect , and throws around familiar looks unearthly indications of the coming change ; a dread disease , in which the struggle between soul and body is so gradual , quiet , and solemn , and the result so sure , that day by day , and grain by grain , the mortal part wastes and withers away , so that the spirit grows light and sanguine with its lightening load , and , feeling immortality at hand , deems it but a new term of mortal life ; a disease in which death and life are so strangely blended , that death takes the glow and hue of life , and life the gaunt and grisly form of death ; a disease which medicine never cured , wealth never warded off , or poverty could boast exemption from ; which sometimes moves in giant strides , and sometimes at a tardy sluggish pace , but , slow or quick , is ever sure and certain . It was with some faint reference in his own mind to this disorder , though he would by no means admit it , even to himself , that Nicholas had already carried his faithful companion to a physician of great repute . There was no cause for immediate alarm , he said . There were no present symptoms which could be deemed conclusive . The constitution had been greatly tried and injured in childhood , but still it MIGHT not be -- and that was all . But he seemed to grow no worse , and , as it was not difficult to find a reason for these symptoms of illness in the shock and agitation he had recently undergone , Nicholas comforted himself with the hope that his poor friend would soon recover . This hope his mother and sister shared with him ; and as the object of their joint solicitude seemed to have no uneasiness or despondency for himself , but each day answered with a quiet smile that he felt better than he had upon the day before , their fears abated , and the general happiness was by degrees restored . Many and many a time in after years did Nicholas look back to this period of his life , and tread again the humble quiet homely scenes that rose up as of old before him . Many and many a time , in the twilight of a summer evening , or beside the flickering winter ’s fire -- but not so often or so sadly then -- would his thoughts wander back to these old days , and dwell with a pleasant sorrow upon every slight remembrance which they brought crowding home . The little room in which they had so often sat long after it was dark , figuring such happy futures ; Kate ’s cheerful voice and merry laugh ; how , if she were from home , they used to sit and watch for her return scarcely breaking silence but to say how dull it seemed without her ; the glee with which poor Smike would start from the darkened corner where he used to sit , and hurry to admit her , and the tears they often saw upon his face , half wondering to see them too , and he so pleased and happy ; every little incident , and even slight words and looks of those old days little heeded then , but well remembered when busy cares and trials were quite forgotten , came fresh and thick before him many and many a time , and , rustling above the dusty growth of years , came back green boughs of yesterday . But there were other persons associated with these recollections , and many changes came about before they had being . A necessary reflection for the purposes of these adventures , which at once subside into their accustomed train , and shunning all flighty anticipations or wayward wanderings , pursue their steady and decorous course . If the brothers Cheeryble , as they found Nicholas worthy of trust and confidence , bestowed upon him every day some new and substantial mark of kindness , they were not less mindful of those who depended on him . Various little presents to Mrs. Nickleby , always of the very things they most required , tended in no slight degree to the improvement and embellishment of the cottage . Kate ’s little store of trinkets became quite dazzling ; and for company ! If brother Charles and brother Ned failed to look in for at least a few minutes every Sunday , or one evening in the week , there was Mr. Tim Linkinwater ( who had never made half - a - dozen other acquaintances in all his life , and who took such delight in his new friends as no words can express ) constantly coming and going in his evening walks , and stopping to rest ; while Mr. Frank Cheeryble happened , by some strange conjunction of circumstances , to be passing the door on some business or other at least three nights in the week . ‘
312648	312685	312646	312646	Kate	210	’ said Mrs. Nickleby to her daughter one evening , when this last - named gentleman had been the subject of the worthy lady ’s eulogium for some time , and Kate had sat perfectly silent . ‘
312690	312694	312688	312688	mama	9827	’ rejoined Kate . ‘
312701	312711	312688	312688	mama	9827	’ cried Mrs. Nickleby , with her wonted suddenness , ‘
312722	312726	312688	312688	mama	9827	’re quite flushed ! ’
312727	312738	312688	312688	mama	9827	‘ Oh , mama ! what strange things you fancy ! ’
312739	312751	312688	312688	mama	9827	‘ It was n’t fancy , Kate , my dear , I ’m
312756	312761	312688	312688	mama	9827	’ returned her mother . ‘
312808	312809	312797	312797	I	0	’ ‘
312816	312830	312811	312811	you	481	’ returned Kate , colouring again ; and this time beyond all dispute . ‘
312834	312839	312811	312811	you	481	’ returned Mrs. Nickleby ; ‘
312848	312910	312847	312847	I	0	’m sure I never was more serious . I will say that his politeness and attention to me is one of the most becoming , gratifying , pleasant things I have seen for a very long time . You do n’t often meet with such behaviour in young men , and it strikes one more when one does meet with it . ’
312911	312920	312922	312922	Kate	210	‘ Oh ! attention to YOU , mama , ’
312926	312927	312922	312922	Kate	210	’ ‘
312933	312938	312931	312931	Kate	210	’ retorted Mrs. Nickleby , ‘
312963	312982	312960	312960	I	0	’m quite sorry to think he should be in love with a German lady , that I am . ’
312983	312997	312999	312999	Kate	210	‘ He said very positively that it was no such thing , mama , ’
313001	313019	313020	313020	she	210	‘ Do n’t you remember his saying so that very first night he came here ? Besides , ’
313029	313049	313020	313020	she	210	‘ why should WE be sorry if it is the case ? What is it to us , mama ? ’
313050	313059	313061	313062	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ Nothing to US , Kate , perhaps , ’
313066	313131	313061	313062	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ but something to ME , I confess . I like English people to be thorough English people , and not half English and half I do n’t know what . I shall tell him point - blank next time he comes , that I wish he would marry one of his own country - women ; and see what he says to that . ’
313132	313144	313146	313146	Kate	210	‘ Pray do n’t think of such a thing , mama , ’
313150	313160	313146	313146	Kate	210	‘ not for the world . Consider . How very-- ’
313161	313171	313173	313174	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ Well , my dear , how very what ? ’
313333	313340	313342	313344	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ I saw nothing of him , ’
313346	313357	313342	313344	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ but I saw that dear old soul Mr. Linkinwater . ’
313358	313384	313386	313387	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ Taking his evening walk , and coming on to rest here , before he turns back to the city , I ’ll be bound ! ’
313389	313396	313398	313400	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ I should think he was , ’
313402	313412	313398	313400	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ especially as young Mr. Cheeryble was with him . ’
313413	313427	313429	313429	Kate	210	‘ Surely that is no reason why Mr. Linkinwater should be coming here , ’
313431	313441	313443	313445	Miss La Creevy	222	‘ Why I think it is , my dear , ’
313447	313493	313495	313497	the little woman	11065	‘ For a young man , Mr Frank is not a very great walker ; and I observe that he generally falls tired , and requires a good long rest , when he has come as far as this . But where is my friend ? ’
313509	313522	313495	313497	the little woman	11065	‘ He has not been run away with again , has he ? ’
313523	313531	313533	313534	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ Ah ! where is Mr. Smike ? ’
313536	313543	313533	313534	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ he was here this instant . ’
313572	313576	313578	313579	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ Well now , ’
313581	313768	313770	313771	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ he is the strangest creature ! Last Tuesday -- was it Tuesday ? Yes , to be sure it was ; you recollect , Kate , my dear , the very last time young Mr. Cheeryble was here -- last Tuesday night he went off in just the same strange way , at the very moment the knock came to the door . It can not be that he do n’t like company , because he is always fond of people who are fond of Nicholas , and I am sure young Mr Cheeryble is . And the strangest thing is , that he does not go to bed ; therefore it can not be because he is tired . I know he does n’t go to bed , because my room is the next one , and when I went upstairs last Tuesday , hours after him , I found that he had not even taken his shoes off ; and he had no candle , so he must have sat moping in the dark all the time . Now , upon my word , ’
313773	313787	313770	313771	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ when I come to think of it , that ’s very extraordinary ! ’
313830	313834	313836	313837	that lady	1897	‘ I hope , ’
313839	313973	313836	313837	that lady	1897	‘ that this unaccountable conduct may not be the beginning of his taking to his bed and living there all his life , like the Thirsty Woman of Tutbury , or the Cock - lane Ghost , or some of those extraordinary creatures . One of them had some connection with our family . I forget , without looking back to some old letters I have upstairs , whether it was my great - grandfather who went to school with the Cock - lane Ghost , or the Thirsty Woman of Tutbury who went to school with my grandmother . Miss La Creevy , you know , of course . Which was it that did n’t mind what the clergyman said ? The Cock - lane Ghost or the Thirsty Woman of Tutbury ? ’
313974	313984	314117	314118	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ The Cock - lane Ghost , I believe . ’
313985	313992	313994	313995	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ Then I have no doubt , ’
313997	314065	313994	313995	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ that it was with him my great - grandfather went to school ; for I know the master of his school was a dissenter , and that would , in a great measure , account for the Cock - lane Ghost ’s behaving in such an improper manner to the clergyman when he grew up . Ah ! Train up a Ghost -- child , I mean-- ’
314104	314115	314117	314118	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ I am so sorry Nicholas is not at home , ’
314120	314134	314117	314118	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ Kate , my dear , you must be both Nicholas and yourself . ’
314135	314143	314145	314145	Frank	481	‘ Miss Nickleby need be but herself , ’
314147	314164	314145	314145	Frank	481	‘ I -- if I may venture to say so -- oppose all change in her . ’
314165	314177	314179	314180	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ Then at all events she shall press you to stay , ’
314182	314215	314179	314180	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ Mr. Linkinwater says ten minutes , but I can not let you go so soon ; Nicholas would be very much vexed , I am sure . Kate , my dear ! ’
314353	314364	314365	314365	she	210	‘ though I never saw her look better , certainly , ’
315186	315189	315166	315171	the pale and trembling servant girl	6689	‘ right down ’
315424	315439	315469	315484	some man up the chimney , of whom nothing was visible but a pair of legs	6697	‘ Has she then failed in her truth , the beautiful maid I adore ? ’
315568	315576	315578	315578	Frank	481	‘ This must be some drunken fellow , ’
315580	315589	315578	315578	Frank	481	‘ No thief would announce his presence thus . ’
315674	315677	315679	315679	Frank	481	‘ Yes , ’
315686	315709	315679	315679	Frank	481	‘ Small - clothes certainly , and -- and -- rough grey stockings , too . Do you know him , ma’am ? ’
315710	315716	315718	315719	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ Kate , my dear , ’
315753	316063	316065	316066	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ you will have the goodness , my love , to explain precisely how this matter stands . I have given him no encouragement -- none whatever -- not the least in the world . You know that , my dear , perfectly well . He was very respectful , exceedingly respectful , when he declared , as you were a witness to ; still at the same time , if I am to be persecuted in this way , if vegetable what’s - his - names and all kinds of garden - stuff are to strew my path out of doors , and gentlemen are to come choking up our chimneys at home , I really do n’t know -- upon my word I do NOT know -- what is to become of me . It ’s a very hard case -- harder than anything I was ever exposed to , before I married your poor dear papa , though I suffered a good deal of annoyance then -- but that , of course , I expected , and made up my mind for . When I was not nearly so old as you , my dear , there was a young gentleman who sat next us at church , who used , almost every Sunday , to cut my name in large letters in the front of his pew while the sermon was going on . It was gratifying , of course , naturally so , but still it was an annoyance , because the pew was in a very conspicuous place , and he was several times publicly taken out by the beadle for doing it . But that was nothing to this . This is a great deal worse , and a great deal more embarrassing . I would rather , Kate , my dear , ’
316078	316104	316065	316066	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ I would rather , I declare , have been a pig - faced lady , than be exposed to such a life as this ! ’
316183	316190	316192	316193	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ He gives me great pain , ’
316199	316226	316192	316193	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ great pain ; but do n’t hurt a hair of his head , I beg . On no account hurt a hair of his head . ’
316362	316369	316371	316371	Kate	210	‘ Oh ! yes , yes , ’
316387	316419	316374	316380	the whole figure of this singular visitor	6706	‘ I know who it is . Pray do n’t be rough with him . Is he hurt ? I hope not . Oh , pray see if he is hurt . ’
316420	316429	316431	316431	Frank	481	‘ He is not , I assure you , ’
316450	316459	316374	316380	the whole figure of this singular visitor	6706	‘ He is not hurt in the least . ’
316460	316469	316471	316471	Kate	210	‘ Do n’t let him come any nearer , ’
316480	316489	316491	316491	Frank	481	‘ Oh , no , he shall not , ’
316493	316519	316491	316491	Frank	481	‘ You see I have him secure here . But may I ask you what this means , and whether you expected this old gentleman ? ’
316520	316525	316527	316527	Kate	210	‘ Oh , no , ’
316529	316571	316527	316527	Kate	210	‘ of course not ; but he -- mama does not think so , I believe -- but he is a mad gentleman who has escaped from the next house , and must have found an opportunity of secreting himself here . ’
316572	316575	316577	316578	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ Kate , ’
316583	316590	316577	316578	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ I am surprised at you . ’
316591	316595	316596	316596	Kate	210	‘ Dear mama , ’
316600	316607	316609	316610	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ I am surprised at you , ’
316612	316759	316761	316762	Mrs Nickleby	207	‘ upon my word , Kate , I am quite astonished that you should join the persecutors of this unfortunate gentleman , when you know very well that they have the basest designs upon his property , and that that is the whole secret of it . It would be much kinder of you , Kate , to ask Mr. Linkinwater or Mr. Cheeryble to interfere in his behalf , and see him righted . You ought not to allow your feelings to influence you ; it ’s not right , very far from it . What should my feelings be , do you suppose ? If anybody ought to be indignant , who is it ? I , of course , and very properly so . Still , at the same time , I would n’t commit such an injustice for the world . No , ’
316779	316889	316765	316765	herself	207	‘ this gentleman will understand me when I tell him that I repeat the answer I gave him the other day ; that I always will repeat it , though I do believe him to be sincere when I find him placing himself in such dreadful situations on my account ; and that I request him to have the goodness to go away directly , or it will be impossible to keep his behaviour a secret from my son Nicholas . I am obliged to him , very much obliged to him , but I can not listen to his addresses for a moment . It ’s quite impossible . ’
316975	316983	316985	316986	that lady	1897	‘ I have nothing more to say , ’
316989	316998	316959	316959	he	8480	‘ I really can not say anything more . ’
316999	317003	317005	317007	the old gentleman	8480	‘ Very good , ’
317013	317029	317005	317007	the old gentleman	8480	‘ then bring in the bottled lightning , a clean tumbler , and a corkscrew . ’
317289	317292	317294	317296	the old gentleman	8480	‘ Aha ! ’
317312	317352	317299	317299	his	8480	‘ I see her now ; I see her now ! My love , my life , my bride , my peerless beauty . She is come at last -- at last -- and all is gas and gaiters ! ’
317410	317415	317417	317419	the old gentleman	8480	‘ She is come ! ’
317428	317517	317422	317422	his	8480	‘ Cormoran and Blunderbore ! She is come ! All the wealth I have is hers if she will take me for her slave . Where are grace , beauty , and blandishments , like those ? In the Empress of Madagascar ? No . In the Queen of Diamonds ? No . In Mrs. Rowland , who every morning bathes in Kalydor for nothing ? No . Melt all these down into one , with the three Graces , the nine Muses , and fourteen biscuit - bakers ’
317537	317584	317533	317533	I	0	’ After uttering this rhapsody , the old gentleman snapped his fingers twenty or thirty times , and then subsided into an ecstatic contemplation of Miss La Creevy ’s charms . This affording Mrs. Nickleby a favourable opportunity of explanation , she went about it straight . ‘
317589	317600	317585	317585	I	0	’ said the worthy lady , with a prefatory cough , ‘
317804	317812	317786	317786	I	0	’ here Mrs. Nickleby simpered and hesitated , ‘
317817	317888	317786	317786	I	0	’ It might have been expected that the old gentleman would have been penetrated to the heart by the delicacy and condescension of this appeal , and that he would at least have returned a courteous and suitable reply . What , then , was the shock which Mrs. Nickleby received , when , accosting HER in the most unmistakable manner , he replied in a loud and sonourous voice : ‘
317893	317894	317895	317895	Sir	714	’ ‘
317897	317907	317908	317908	Cat	438	’ cried Mrs. Nickleby , in a faint tone . ‘
317910	317916	317917	317917	Puss	565	’ repeated the old gentleman . ‘
317931	318032	318033	318033	I	0	’ with which last sound , uttered in a hissing manner between his teeth , the old gentleman swung his arms violently round and round , and at the same time alternately advanced on Mrs. Nickleby , and retreated from her , in that species of savage dance with which boys on market - days may be seen to frighten pigs , sheep , and other animals , when they give out obstinate indications of turning down a wrong street . Mrs. Nickleby wasted no words , but uttered an exclamation of horror and surprise , and immediately fainted away . ‘
318039	318045	318033	318033	I	0	’ said Kate , hastily ; ‘
318064	318140	318141	318141	Kate	210	’ Frank was not at all confident of his power of complying with this request , until he bethought himself of the stratagem of sending Miss La Creevy on a few paces in advance , and urging the old gentleman to follow her . It succeeded to a miracle ; and he went away in a rapture of admiration , strongly guarded by Tim Linkinwater on one side , and Frank himself on the other . ‘
318143	318155	318141	318141	Kate	210	’ murmured Mrs. Nickleby , reviving when the coast was clear , ‘
318160	318168	318141	318141	Kate	210	’ She was assured that he was . ‘
318177	318182	318175	318175	Kate	210	’ said Mrs. Nickleby . ‘
318199	318200	318201	318201	YOU	0	’ ‘
318205	318212	318201	318201	YOU	0	’ said Kate , greatly astonished . ‘
318218	318228	318213	318213	I	0	’ replied Mrs. Nickleby , with a desperate calmness . ‘
318350	318351	318356	318356	they	6743	’ ‘

318373	318378	318365	318365	I	0	’ rejoined her mother . ‘
318480	318738	318739	318739	I	0	’ Washing her hands , thus , of all responsibility under this head , past , present , or to come , Mrs. Nickleby kindly added that she hoped her children might never have greater cause to reproach themselves than she had , and prepared herself to receive the escort , who soon returned with the intelligence that the old gentleman was safely housed , and that they found his custodians , who had been making merry with some friends , wholly ignorant of his absence . Quiet being again restored , a delicious half - hour -- so Frank called it , in the course of subsequent conversation with Tim Linkinwater as they were walking home -- was spent in conversation , and Tim ’s watch at length apprising him that it was high time to depart , the ladies were left alone , though not without many offers on the part of Frank to remain until Nicholas arrived , no matter what hour of the night it might be , if , after the late neighbourly irruption , they entertained the least fear of being left to themselves . As their freedom from all further apprehension , however , left no pretext for his insisting on mounting guard , he was obliged to abandon the citadel , and to retire with the trusty Tim . Nearly three hours of silence passed away . Kate blushed to find , when Nicholas returned , how long she had been sitting alone , occupied with her own thoughts . ‘
318750	318754	318739	318739	I	0	’ she said . ‘
318764	318769	318762	318762	Kate	210	’ rejoined Nicholas gaily , ‘
318783	318809	318780	318780	they	6747	’ Kate was confused ; she toyed with some trifle on the table , looked up and smiled , looked down and dropped a tear . ‘
318814	318827	318812	318812	Kate	210	’ said Nicholas , drawing his sister towards him and kissing her , ‘
318868	318950	318860	318860	I	0	’ There was something in this proposition , albeit it was said without the slightest consciousness or application , which so alarmed his sister , that Nicholas laughingly changed the subject to domestic matters , and thus gathered , by degrees , as they left the room and went upstairs together , how lonely Smike had been all night -- and by very slow degrees , too ; for on this subject also , Kate seemed to speak with some reluctance . ‘
318954	318964	318951	318952	Poor fellow	926	’ said Nicholas , tapping gently at his door , ‘
318974	319013	318951	318952	Poor fellow	926	’ Kate was hanging on her brother ’s arm . The door being quickly opened , she had not time to disengage herself , before Smike , very pale and haggard , and completely dressed , confronted them . ‘
319022	319026	319016	319016	you	210	’ said Nicholas . ‘
319033	319054	319016	319016	you	210	’ was the reply . Nicholas gently detained his sister , who made an effort to retire ; and asked , ‘
319058	319059	319016	319016	you	210	’ ‘
319065	319079	319060	319060	I	0	’ said Smike , grasping the hand which his friend extended to him . ‘
319085	319089	319080	319080	You	0	’ rejoined Nicholas . ‘
319101	319106	319090	319090	I	0	’ said Smike quickly . ‘
319119	319128	319110	319110	you	0	’ inquired Nicholas , in his kindest manner ; ‘
319145	319146	319147	319147	I	0	’ ‘
319155	319159	319152	319152	I	0	’ he replied . ‘
319209	319364	319200	319200	you	0	’ He wrung Nicholas ’s hand before he released it ; and glancing , for a moment , at the brother and sister as they stood together , as if there were something in their strong affection which touched him very deeply , withdrew into his chamber , and was soon the only watcher under that quiet roof . CHAPTER 50 Involves a serious Catastrophe The little race - course at Hampton was in the full tide and height of its gaiety ; the day as dazzling as day could be ; the sun high in the cloudless sky , and shining in its fullest splendour .

321964	321988	321948	321948	you	358	’ said Lord Frederick . Sir Mulberry turned away to speak to one of his own party , and feigned not to hear . ‘
321995	322007	321948	321948	you	358	’ said the friend , affecting to speak in a whisper , ‘

322156	322165	322148	322148	I	0	’ said the other , shrugging his shoulders , ‘

322185	322227	322228	322228	I	0	’ said Sir Mulberry , turning abruptly on his heel , and drawing his pupil with him . Falling , again , into the loitering , careless pace at which they had entered , they lounged out , arm in arm . ‘
322240	322248	322228	322228	I	0	’ muttered Sir Mulberry with an oath ; ‘
322264	322298	322299	322299	I	0	’ His companion said nothing , but there was something in his manner which galled Sir Mulberry to add , with nearly as much ferocity as if his friend had been Nicholas himself : ‘
322368	322369	322476	322476	you	0	’ ‘
322380	322440	322476	322476	you	0	’ inquired Lord Frederick . Sir Mulberry Hawk honoured him with an angry glance , but condescended to return no verbal answer to this inquiry . Both walked sullenly on , as though their thoughts were busily occupied , until they were quite clear of the crowd , and almost alone , when Sir Mulberry wheeled round to return . ‘
322443	322448	322476	322476	you	0	’ said his companion , ‘
322472	322473	322476	322476	you	0	’ ‘
322493	322502	322476	322476	you	0	’ returned his Mentor , disengaging his arm . ‘
322505	322510	322503	322503	Hawk	358	’ rejoined the other , ‘
322518	322519	322514	322514	I	0	’ ‘
322523	322529	322514	322514	I	0	’ interrupted the other disdainfully . ‘

322558	322563	322514	322514	I	0	’ returned Lord Frederick , ‘

322640	322649	322620	322620	you	0	’ said Sir Mulberry , with a sneer . ‘
322653	322654	322620	322620	you	0	’ ‘
322668	322673	322663	322664	the devil	1470	’ replied Sir Mulberry , ‘
322681	322740	322663	322664	the devil	1470	’ Such was the ascendancy he had acquired over his dupe , and such the latter ’s general habit of submission , that , for the moment , the young man seemed half afraid to pursue the subject . He soon overcame this feeling , however , if it had restrained him at all , and retorted angrily : ‘
322781	322782	322784	322784	you	0	’ ‘
322788	322797	322798	322798	Ye	0	’ asked Sir Mulberry , with a laugh . ‘
322806	322813	322798	322798	Ye	0	’ returned the other , promptly . ‘
322823	322828	322798	322798	Ye	0	’ said Sir Mulberry ; ‘
322853	322854	322847	322847	me	0	’ ‘
322859	322864	322865	322865	I	0	’ retorted Lord Frederick . ‘
322894	322895	322898	322898	you	0	’ ‘
322909	322921	322903	322903	you	0	’ said Sir Mulberry , affecting an easy good - humour . ‘
323039	324229	324251	324251	you	6868	’ With this rejoinder , and waiting for no further discussion , Sir Mulberry Hawk yawned , and very leisurely turned back . There was not a little tact and knowledge of the young lord ’s disposition in this mode of treating him . Sir Mulberry clearly saw that if his dominion were to last , it must be established now . He knew that the moment he became violent , the young man would become violent too . He had , many times , been enabled to strengthen his influence , when any circumstance had occurred to weaken it , by adopting this cool and laconic style ; and he trusted to it now , with very little doubt of its entire success . But while he did this , and wore the most careless and indifferent deportment that his practised arts enabled him to assume , he inwardly resolved , not only to visit all the mortification of being compelled to suppress his feelings , with additional severity upon Nicholas , but also to make the young lord pay dearly for it , one day , in some shape or other . So long as he had been a passive instrument in his hands , Sir Mulberry had regarded him with no other feeling than contempt ; but , now that he presumed to avow opinions in opposition to his , and even to turn upon him with a lofty tone and an air of superiority , he began to hate him . Conscious that , in the vilest and most worthless sense of the term , he was dependent upon the weak young lord , Sir Mulberry could the less brook humiliation at his hands ; and when he began to dislike him he measured his dislike -- as men often do -- by the extent of the injuries he had inflicted upon its object . When it is remembered that Sir Mulberry Hawk had plundered , duped , deceived , and fooled his pupil in every possible way , it will not be wondered at , that , beginning to hate him , he began to hate him cordially . On the other hand , the young lord having thought -- which he very seldom did about anything -- and seriously too , upon the affair with Nicholas , and the circumstances which led to it , had arrived at a manly and honest conclusion . Sir Mulberry ’s coarse and insulting behaviour on the occasion in question had produced a deep impression on his mind ; a strong suspicion of his having led him on to pursue Miss Nickleby for purposes of his own , had been lurking there for some time ; he was really ashamed of his share in the transaction , and deeply mortified by the misgiving that he had been gulled . He had had sufficient leisure to reflect upon these things , during their late retirement ; and , at times , when his careless and indolent nature would permit , had availed himself of the opportunity . Slight circumstances , too , had occurred to increase his suspicion . It wanted but a very slight circumstance to kindle his wrath against Sir Mulberry . This his disdainful and insolent tone in their recent conversation ( the only one they had held upon the subject since the period to which Sir Mulberry referred ) , effected . Thus they rejoined their friends : each with causes of dislike against the other rankling in his breast : and the young man haunted , besides , with thoughts of the vindictive retaliation which was threatened against Nicholas , and the determination to prevent it by some strong step , if possible . But this was not all . Sir Mulberry , conceiving that he had silenced him effectually , could not suppress his triumph , or forbear from following up what he conceived to be his advantage . Mr. Pyke was there , and Mr. Pluck was there , and Colonel Chowser , and other gentlemen of the same caste , and it was a great point for Sir Mulberry to show them that he had not lost his influence . At first , the young lord contented himself with a silent determination to take measures for withdrawing himself from the connection immediately . By degrees , he grew more angry , and was exasperated by jests and familiarities which , a few hours before , would have been a source of amusement to him . This did not serve him ; for , at such bantering or retort as suited the company , he was no match for Sir Mulberry . Still , no violent rupture took place . They returned to town ; Messrs Pyke and Pluck and other gentlemen frequently protesting , on the way thither , that Sir Mulberry had never been in such tiptop spirits in all his life . They dined together , sumptuously . The wine flowed freely , as indeed it had done all day . Sir Mulberry drank to recompense himself for his recent abstinence ; the young lord , to drown his indignation ; and the remainder of the party , because the wine was of the best and they had nothing to pay . It was nearly midnight when they rushed out , wild , burning with wine , their blood boiling , and their brains on fire , to the gaming - table . Here , they encountered another party , mad like themselves . The excitement of play , hot rooms , and glaring lights was not calculated to allay the fever of the time . In that giddy whirl of noise and confusion , the men were delirious . Who thought of money , ruin , or the morrow , in the savage intoxication of the moment ? More wine was called for , glass after glass was drained , their parched and scalding mouths were cracked with thirst . Down poured the wine like oil on blazing fire . And still the riot went on . The debauchery gained its height ; glasses were dashed upon the floor by hands that could not carry them to lips ; oaths were shouted out by lips which could scarcely form the words to vent them in ; drunken losers cursed and roared ; some mounted on the tables , waving bottles above their heads and bidding defiance to the rest ; some danced , some sang , some tore the cards and raved . Tumult and frenzy reigned supreme ; when a noise arose that drowned all others , and two men , seizing each other by the throat , struggled into the middle of the room . A dozen voices , until now unheard , called aloud to part them . Those who had kept themselves cool , to win , and who earned their living in such scenes , threw themselves upon the combatants , and , forcing them asunder , dragged them some space apart . ‘
324234	324245	324246	324246	he	6867	’ cried Sir Mulberry , in a thick hoarse voice ; ‘
324282	324283	324274	324274	you	6868	’ ‘
324290	324299	324287	324287	I	0	’ replied one of those who held him . ‘
324305	324306	324307	324307	I	0	’ ‘
324314	324318	324312	324312	G--	572	’ he replied . ‘
324328	324329	324319	324323	A dozen men about us	6869	’ ‘
324336	324341	324319	324323	A dozen men about us	6869	’ said the friend . ‘
324349	324354	324319	324323	A dozen men about us	6869	’ cried Sir Mulberry . ‘
324362	324391	324319	324323	A dozen men about us	6869	’ His passion was so great , that he could not articulate , but stood clenching his fist , tearing his hair , and stamping upon the ground . ‘
324399	324408	324396	324397	my lord	1500	’ said one of those who surrounded him . ‘
324413	324414	324396	324397	my lord	1500	’ ‘
324419	324425	324426	324426	I	0	’ was the panting reply . ‘
324462	324482	324459	324460	Captain Adams	573	’ said the young lord , looking hurriedly about him , and addressing one of those who had interposed , ‘
324492	324791	324489	324489	I	0	’ The person addressed stepped forward , and taking the young man ’s arm , they retired together , followed shortly afterwards by Sir Mulberry and his friend . It was a profligate haunt of the worst repute , and not a place in which such an affair was likely to awaken any sympathy for either party , or to call forth any further remonstrance or interposition . Elsewhere , its further progress would have been instantly prevented , and time allowed for sober and cool reflection ; but not there . Disturbed in their orgies , the party broke up ; some reeled away with looks of tipsy gravity ; others withdrew noisily discussing what had just occurred ; the gentlemen of honour who lived upon their winnings remarked to each other , as they went out , that Hawk was a good shot ; and those who had been most noisy , fell fast asleep upon the sofas , and thought no more about it . Meanwhile , the two seconds , as they may be called now , after a long conference , each with his principal , met together in another room . Both utterly heartless , both men upon town , both thoroughly initiated in its worst vices , both deeply in debt , both fallen from some higher estate , both addicted to every depravity for which society can find some genteel name and plead its most depraving conventionalities as an excuse , they were naturally gentlemen of most unblemished honour themselves , and of great nicety concerning the honour of other people . These two gentlemen were unusually cheerful just now ; for the affair was pretty certain to make some noise , and could scarcely fail to enhance their reputations . ‘
324800	324809	324798	324798	Adams	573	’ said Mr. Westwood , drawing himself up . ‘
324812	324817	324798	324798	Adams	573	’ returned the captain ; ‘
324834	324835	324839	324839	I	0	’ ‘
324842	324847	324839	324839	I	0	’ said Mr. Westwood . ‘
324864	324869	324839	324839	I	0	’ returned the captain . ‘

324983	324988	324966	324967	Lord Frederick	229	’ returned the other , ‘
325024	325025	325017	325017	you	714	’ ‘
325029	325039	325017	325017	you	714	’ replied the captain , referring to his watch ; ‘
325064	325065	325110	325110	you	714	’ ‘
325102	325107	325110	325110	you	714	’ said Mr. Westwood . ‘
325126	325133	325110	325110	you	714	’ The captain saw no objection . ‘
325161	325198	325199	325199	We	6875	’ said Mr Westwood . To this the captain also assented . After a few other preliminaries , equally brief , and having settled the road each party should take to avoid suspicion , they separated . ‘
325209	325221	325206	325207	my lord	1500	’ said the captain , when he had communicated the arrangements , ‘
325264	325408	325256	325256	yours	1500	’ What a contrast , when they reached the street , to the scene they had just left ! It was already daybreak . For the flaring yellow light within , was substituted the clear , bright , glorious morning ; for a hot , close atmosphere , tainted with the smell of expiring lamps , and reeking with the steams of riot and dissipation , the free , fresh , wholesome air . But to the fevered head on which that cool air blew , it seemed to come laden with remorse for time misspent and countless opportunities neglected . With throbbing veins and burning skin , eyes wild and heavy , thoughts hurried and disordered , he felt as though the light were a reproach , and shrunk involuntarily from the day as if he were some foul and hideous thing . ‘
325411	325416	325256	325256	yours	1500	’ said the captain . ‘
325421	325422	325256	325256	yours	1500	’ ‘
325425	325426	325256	325256	yours	1500	’ ‘
325451	325454	325455	325455	They	6875	’re off . ’
326057	326062	326064	326064	Westwood	571	‘ He ’s gone ! ’
326088	326096	326098	326099	Sir Mulberry	358	‘ His blood on his own head , ’
326101	326114	326098	326099	Sir Mulberry	358	‘ He brought this upon himself , and forced it upon me . ’
326115	326119	326121	326121	Westwood	571	‘ Captain Adams , ’
326125	326205	326210	326210	he	571	‘ I call you to witness that this was fairly done . Hawk , we have not a moment to lose . We must leave this place immediately , push for Brighton , and cross to France with all speed . This has been a bad business , and may be worse , if we delay a moment . Adams , consult your own safety , and do n’t remain here ; the living before the dead ; goodbye ! ’
326507	326997	327088	327088	They	6928	’ hearts , were ranged , in grim array , against the gloomy walls ; attenuated presses , grown lank and lantern - jawed in guarding the treasures they enclosed , and tottering , as though from constant fear and dread of thieves , shrunk up in dark corners , whence they cast no shadows on the ground , and seemed to hide and cower from observation . A tall grim clock upon the stairs , with long lean hands and famished face , ticked in cautious whispers ; and when it struck the time , in thin and piping sounds , like an old man ’s voice , rattled , as if it were pinched with hunger . No fireside couch was there , to invite repose and comfort . Elbow - chairs there were , but they looked uneasy in their minds , cocked their arms suspiciously and timidly , and kept upon their guard . Others , were fantastically grim and gaunt , as having drawn themselves up to their utmost height , and put on their fiercest looks to stare all comers out of countenance . Others , again , knocked up against their neighbours , or leant for support against the wall -- somewhat ostentatiously , as if to call all men to witness that they were not worth the taking . The dark square lumbering bedsteads seemed built for restless dreams ; the musty hangings seemed to creep in scanty folds together , whispering among themselves , when rustled by the wind , their trembling knowledge of the tempting wares that lurked within the dark and tight - locked closets . From out the most spare and hungry room in all this spare and hungry house there came , one morning , the tremulous tones of old Gride ’s voice , as it feebly chirruped forth the fag end of some forgotten song , of which the burden ran : Ta -- ran -- tan -- too , Throw the old shoe , And may the wedding be lucky ! which he repeated , in the same shrill quavering notes , again and again , until a violent fit of coughing obliged him to desist , and to pursue in silence , the occupation upon which he was engaged . This occupation was , to take down from the shelves of a worm - eaten wardrobe a quantity of frouzy garments , one by one ; to subject each to a careful and minute inspection by holding it up against the light , and after folding it with great exactness , to lay it on one or other of two little heaps beside him . He never took two articles of clothing out together , but always brought them forth , singly , and never failed to shut the wardrobe door , and turn the key , between each visit to its shelves . ‘
327004	327014	327088	327088	They	6928	’ said Arthur Gride , surveying a threadbare coat . ‘
327028	327087	327088	327088	They	6928	’ The result of his cogitations appeared to be unfavourable , for he folded the garment once more , laid it aside , and mounted on a chair to get down another , chirping while he did so : Young , loving , and fair , Oh what happiness there ! The wedding is sure to be lucky ! ‘
327096	327101	327088	327088	They	6928	’ said old Arthur , ‘
327180	327214	327154	327154	he	6932	’ In the satisfaction of this discovery , he went over the verse again , with increased expression , and a shake or two here and there . He then resumed his employment . ‘
327220	327225	327154	327154	he	6932	’ said old Arthur ; ‘
327367	327430	327360	327360	I’ll	0	’ This call , loudly repeated twice or thrice at the room - door , brought into the apartment a short , thin , weasen , blear - eyed old woman , palsy - stricken and hideously ugly , who , wiping her shrivelled face upon her dirty apron , inquired , in that subdued tone in which deaf people commonly speak : ‘
327482	327483	327484	327484	Me	0	’ ‘
327490	327507	327486	327486	Peg	576	’ said Arthur Gride , tapping himself on the breast to render the reply more intelligible . ‘
327512	327516	327486	327486	Peg	576	’ returned Peg . ‘
327523	327524	327520	327520	YOU	0	’ ‘
327535	327540	327525	327525	I	0	’ cried Arthur Gride . ‘
327554	327566	327552	327552	master	8990	’ rejoined Peg , after a short inspection of the suit . ‘
327576	327577	327552	327552	master	8990	’ ‘
327583	327588	327552	327552	master	8990	’ replied old Arthur . ‘
327593	327597	327552	327552	master	8990	’ retorted Peg . ‘
327615	327616	327617	327617	They	6942	’ ‘
327624	327629	327622	327622	Peg	576	’ returned her master . ‘
327634	327638	327622	327622	Peg	576	’ said Peg . ‘
327641	327642	327622	327622	Peg	576	’ ‘
327646	327652	327622	327622	Peg	576	’ said Peg , sharply . ‘
327660	327679	327622	327622	Peg	576	’ Arthur Gride muttered an imprecation on his housekeeper ’s deafness , as he roared in her ear : ‘
327694	327695	327691	327691	I	0	’ ‘
327698	327702	327691	327691	I	0	’ cried Peg . ‘
327763	327810	327811	327811	You	8990	’ With which consolatory assurance , Peg Sliderskew gathered up the chosen suit , and folding her skinny arms upon the bundle , stood , mouthing , and grinning , and blinking her watery eyes , like an uncouth figure in some monstrous piece of carving . ‘
327812	327823	327825	327825	Arthur	548	’re in a funny humour , an’t you , Peg ? ’
327834	327845	327847	327849	the old woman	12062	‘ Why , is n’t it enough to make me ? ’
327851	327937	327847	327849	the old woman	12062	‘ I shall , soon enough , be put out , though , if anybody tries to domineer it over me : and so I give you notice , master . Nobody shall be put over Peg Sliderskew ’s head , after so many years ; you know that , and so I need n’t tell you ! That wo n’t do for me -- no , no , nor for you . Try that once , and come to ruin -- ruin -- ruin ! ’
327938	327950	327952	327953	Arthur Gride	548	‘ Oh dear , dear , I shall never try it , ’
327963	328015	327952	327953	Arthur Gride	548	‘ not for the world . It would be very easy to ruin me ; we must be very careful ; more saving than ever , with another mouth to feed . Only we -- we must n’t let her lose her good looks , Peg , because I like to see ‘
328018	328019	327952	327953	Arthur Gride	548	’ ‘
328031	328039	327952	327953	Arthur Gride	548	’ returned Peg , shaking her forefinger . ‘
328049	328068	328047	328047	Peg	576	’ said Arthur Gride , eagerly watching what effect his communication produced upon the old woman ’s countenance : ‘
328162	328163	328157	328157	you	0	’ ‘
328179	328183	328176	328176	she	6946	’ returned Peg . ‘
328189	328193	328184	328187	A fool of ME	6947	’ exclaimed Arthur . ‘
328223	328232	328220	328221	Mrs Sliderskew	577	’ he softly added by way of soliloquy . ‘
328234	328246	328248	328248	Peg	576	’re a saying something you do n’t want me to hear , ’
328250	328256	328248	328248	Peg	576	‘ I know you are . ’
328257	328268	328270	328270	Arthur	548	‘ Oh dear ! the devil ’s in this woman , ’
328278	328293	328248	328248	Peg	576	‘ I said I trusted everything to you , Peg . That was all . ’
328294	328308	328310	328310	Peg	576	‘ You do that , master , and all your cares are over , ’
328313	328322	328324	328325	Arthur Gride	548	‘ WHEN I do that , Peg Sliderskew , ’
328327	328332	328324	328325	Arthur Gride	548	‘ they will be . ’
328379	328526	328368	328368	he	548	‘ Take up all loose stitches in the bottle - green with the best black silk . Have a skein of the best , and some new buttons for the coat , and -- this is a good idea , Peg , and one you ’ll like , I know -- as I have never given her anything yet , and girls like such attentions , you shall polish up a sparking necklace that I have got upstairs , and I ’ll give it her upon the wedding morning -- clasp it round her charming little neck myself -- and take it away again next day . He , he , he ! I ’ll lock it up for her , Peg , and lose it . Who ’ll be made the fool of there , I wonder , to begin with -- eh , Peg ? ’
328619	328629	328603	328603	she	577	‘ She ’s half a witch , I think , ’
328641	328702	328603	328603	she	577	‘ But she ’s very frugal , and she ’s very deaf . Her living costs me next to nothing ; and it ’s no use her listening at keyholes ; for she ca n’t hear . She ’s a charming woman -- for the purpose ; a most discreet old housekeeper , and worth her weight in -- copper . ’
328841	328847	328849	328850	Arthur Gride	548	‘ Ah ! Mr. Noggs ! ’
328856	328872	328849	328850	Arthur Gride	548	‘ My good friend , Mr. Noggs , what news do you bring for me ? ’
328899	328910	328873	328873	Newman	211	‘ A letter . From Mr. Nickleby . Bearer waits . ’
328911	328919	328920	328920	Newman	211	‘ Wo n’t you take a -- a-- ’
328929	328933	328935	328936	Arthur Gride	548	‘ --A chair ? ’
328938	328941	328943	328943	Newman	211	‘ No , ’
328945	328948	328943	328943	Newman	211	‘ Thankee . ’
329011	329014	329016	329016	Newman	211	‘ Answer , ’
329018	329022	329016	329016	Newman	211	‘ Bearer waits . ’
329023	329026	329028	329029	old Arthur	548	‘ True , ’
329031	329044	329028	329029	old Arthur	548	‘ Yes -- yes ; I almost forgot , I do declare . ’
329045	329052	329054	329054	Newman	211	‘ I thought you were forgetting , ’
329056	329072	329074	329074	Arthur	548	‘ Quite right to remind me , Mr. Noggs . Oh , very right indeed , ’
329076	329098	329074	329074	Arthur	548	‘ Yes . I ’ll write a line . I’m -- I’m -- rather flurried , Mr. Noggs . The news is-- ’
329099	329102	329104	329104	Newman	211	‘ Bad ? ’
329106	329153	329074	329074	Arthur	548	‘ No , Mr. Noggs , thank you ; good , good . The very best of news . Sit down . I ’ll get the pen and ink , and write a line in answer . I ’ll not detain you long . I know you ’re
329203	329204	329195	329195	I	0	’ ‘
329223	329277	329278	329278	GRIDE	548	’ thought Newman , as Gride hurried out . The letter had fallen on the ground . Looking carefully about him for an instant , Newman , impelled by curiosity to know the result of the design he had overheard from his office closet , caught it up and rapidly read as follows : ‘
329280	329346	329278	329278	GRIDE	548	‘ I saw Bray again this morning , and proposed the day after tomorrow ( as you suggested ) for the marriage . There is no objection on his part , and all days are alike to his daughter . We will go together , and you must be with me by seven in the morning . I need not tell you to be punctual . ‘
329416	329419	329405	329405	You	6959	‘ Yours , ‘
329423	329518	329420	329421	RALPH NICKLEBY	208	’ A footstep was heard without . Newman dropped the letter on the same spot again , pressed it with his foot to prevent its fluttering away , regained his seat in a single stride , and looked as vacant and unconscious as ever mortal looked . Arthur Gride , after peering nervously about him , spied it on the ground , picked it up , and sitting down to write , glanced at Newman Noggs , who was staring at the wall with an intensity so remarkable , that Arthur was quite alarmed . ‘
329528	329556	329525	329526	Mr. Noggs	211	’ said Arthur , trying to follow the direction of Newman ’s eyes -- which was an impossibility , and a thing no man had ever done . ‘
329561	329565	329525	329526	Mr. Noggs	211	’ replied Newman . ‘
329572	329573	329525	329526	Mr. Noggs	211	’ ‘
329576	329580	329525	329526	Mr. Noggs	211	’ said Newman . ‘
329588	329589	329525	329526	Mr. Noggs	211	’ ‘
329598	329603	329525	329526	Mr. Noggs	211	’ observed Arthur Gride . ‘
329611	329615	329696	329697	Mr. Noggs	211	’ returned Newman ; ‘
329620	329691	329696	329697	Mr. Noggs	211	’ Newman appeared to derive great entertainment from this repartee , and to the great discomposure of Arthur Gride ’s nerves , produced a series of sharp cracks from his finger - joints , resembling the noise of a distant discharge of small artillery . Arthur succeeded in finishing his reply to Ralph ’s note , nevertheless , and at length handed it over to the eccentric messenger for delivery . ‘
329699	329759	329696	329697	Mr. Noggs	211	’ said Gride . Newman gave a nod , put it in his hat , and was shuffling away , when Gride , whose doting delight knew no bounds , beckoned him back again , and said , in a shrill whisper , and with a grin which puckered up his whole face , and almost obscured his eyes : ‘
329776	329900	329764	329764	you	211	’ In good fellowship ( if Arthur Gride had been capable of it ) Newman would not have drunk with him one bubble of the richest wine that was ever made ; but to see what he would be at , and to punish him as much as he could , he accepted the offer immediately . Arthur Gride , therefore , again applied himself to the press , and from a shelf laden with tall Flemish drinking - glasses , and quaint bottles : some with necks like so many storks , and others with square Dutch - built bodies and short fat apoplectic throats : took down one dusty bottle of promising appearance , and two glasses of curiously small size . ‘
329906	329910	329901	329901	You	211	’ said Arthur . ‘
329955	330043	329764	329764	you	211	’ As his courage appeared to be fast failing him , and he trifled with the stopper in a manner which threatened the dismissal of the bottle to its old place , Newman took up one of the little glasses , and clinked it , twice or thrice , against the bottle , as a gentle reminder that he had not been helped yet . With a deep sigh , Arthur Gride slowly filled it -- though not to the brim -- and then filled his own . ‘
330054	330065	329764	329764	you	211	’ he said , laying his hand on Newman ’s ; ‘
330118	330119	330115	330116	Mr. Noggs	211	’ ‘
330122	330132	330115	330116	Mr. Noggs	211	’ said Newman , eyeing his little glass impatiently . ‘
330139	330140	330136	330136	Bearer	6965	’ ‘
330151	330155	330145	330145	I	0	’ tittered Arthur , ‘
330169	330170	330171	330172	THE ladies	740	’ ‘
330174	330178	330171	330172	THE ladies	740	’ said Newman . ‘
330186	330194	330195	330196	A lady	867	’ replied Gride , arresting his hand , ‘
330233	330234	330235	330235	Madeline	542	’ ‘
330237	330244	330235	330235	Madeline	542	’ said Newman ; inwardly adding , ‘
330250	330453	330248	330248	her	542	’ The rapidity and unconcern with which Newman dismissed his portion of the golden water , had a great effect upon the old man , who sat upright in his chair , and gazed at him , open - mouthed , as if the sight had taken away his breath . Quite unmoved , however , Newman left him to sip his own at leisure , or to pour it back again into the bottle , if he chose , and departed ; after greatly outraging the dignity of Peg Sliderskew by brushing past her , in the passage , without a word of apology or recognition . Mr. Gride and his housekeeper , immediately on being left alone , resolved themselves into a committee of ways and means , and discussed the arrangements which should be made for the reception of the young bride . As they were , like some other committees , extremely dull and prolix in debate , this history may pursue the footsteps of Newman Noggs ; thereby combining advantage with necessity ; for it would have been necessary to do so under any circumstances , and necessity has no law , as all the world knows . ‘
330461	330469	330454	330454	You	6970	’ said Ralph , when Newman returned . ‘
330476	330480	330470	330470	HE	6971	’ replied Newman . ‘
330483	330488	330491	330491	his	6971	’ cried Ralph impatiently . ‘
330523	330550	330521	330521	sir	714	’ Newman handed in the note , and looked very virtuous and innocent while his employer broke the seal , and glanced his eye over it . ‘
330558	330569	330551	330551	He	6971	’ muttered Ralph , as he tore it to pieces ; ‘
330611	330612	330613	330613	I	0	’ ‘
330618	330622	330613	330613	I	0	’ replied Newman . ‘
330632	330641	330630	330630	sir	714	’ said Ralph , with a threatening look . ‘
330646	330651	330642	330642	I	0	’ returned Newman boldly , ‘
330690	330691	330683	330683	He	6971	’ ‘
330697	330701	330694	330694	he	6971	’ said Ralph ; ‘
330705	330706	330694	330694	he	6971	’ ‘
330780	330781	330777	330777	he	6971	’ ‘
330789	330799	330785	330785	you	0	’ inquired Ralph , looking keenly at his drudge . ‘
330883	330884	330880	330880	him	6971	’ ‘
330889	330893	330880	330880	him	6971	’ Ralph muttered . ‘
330900	330904	330905	330905	I	0	’ said Newman . ‘
330935	330936	330932	330932	YOU	6970	’ ‘
330942	330946	330939	330939	I	0	’ replied Ralph . ‘
330949	330955	330939	330939	I	0	’ retored Newman , sulkily , ‘
331026	331052	331053	331053	He	6971	’ This was true enough ; though the question which Newman anticipated , was , in fact , upon Ralph ’s lips at the moment . ‘
331059	331063	331055	331057	an idle ruffian	6980	’ said Ralph ; ‘
331176	331177	331170	331170	I	0	’ ‘
331181	331185	331170	331170	I	0	’ said Newman . ‘
331190	331194	331170	331170	I	0	’ returned Ralph , ‘
331207	331371	331372	331372	I	0	’ Newman readily availed himself of the permission , and , shutting himself up in his little office , remained there , in very serious cogitation , all day . When he was released at night , he proceeded , with all the expedition he could use , to the city , and took up his old position behind the pump , to watch for Nicholas . For Newman Noggs was proud in his way , and could not bear to appear as his friend , before the brothers Cheeryble , in the shabby and degraded state to which he was reduced . He had not occupied this position many minutes , when he was rejoiced to see Nicholas approaching , and darted out from his ambuscade to meet him . Nicholas , on his part , was no less pleased to encounter his friend , whom he had not seen for some time ; so , their greeting was a warm one . ‘
331382	331386	331372	331372	I	0	’ said Nicholas . ‘
331391	331395	331397	331397	I	0	’ rejoined Newman , ‘
331423	331424	331410	331410	I	0	’ ‘
331431	331441	331442	331442	I	0	’ returned Nicholas , smiling at this odd communication . ‘
331461	331465	331451	331451	I	0	’ said Newman ; ‘
331500	331511	331496	331496	I	0	‘ em now , in case you should be disappointed . ’
331512	331516	331518	331518	Nicholas	207	‘ I disappointed ! ’
331520	331525	331518	331518	Nicholas	207	‘ am I interested ? ’
331526	331532	331534	331534	Newman	211	‘ I think you are , ’
331536	331589	331591	331591	Newman	211	‘ I have a crotchet in my head that it must be so . I have found out a man , who plainly knows more than he cares to tell at once . And he has already dropped such hints to me as puzzle me -- I say , as puzzle me , ’
331801	331807	331809	331809	Newman	211	‘ And that reminds me , ’
331811	331824	331809	331809	Newman	211	‘ that you never told me the young lady ’s real name . ’
331825	331828	331830	331830	Nicholas	207	‘ Madeline ! ’
331832	331835	331837	331837	Newman	211	‘ Madeline ! ’
331839	331852	331837	331837	Newman	211	‘ What Madeline ? Her other name . Say her other name . ’
331853	331856	331858	331858	Nicholas	207	‘ Bray , ’
331864	331870	331872	331872	Newman	211	‘ It ’s the same ! ’
331874	331898	331872	331872	Newman	211	‘ Sad story ! Can you stand idly by , and let that unnatural marriage take place without one attempt to save her ? ’
331899	331905	331907	331907	Nicholas	207	‘ What do you mean ? ’
331912	331919	331907	331907	Nicholas	207	‘ marriage ! are you mad ? ’
331920	331937	331939	331939	Newman	211	‘ Are you ? Is she ? Are you blind , deaf , senseless , dead ? ’
331941	332014	331939	331939	Newman	211	‘ Do you know that within one day , by means of your uncle Ralph , she will be married to a man as bad as he , and worse , if worse there is ? Do you know that , within one day , she will be sacrificed , as sure as you stand there alive , to a hoary wretch -- a devil born and bred , and grey in devils ’
332017	332018	331907	331907	Nicholas	207	’ ‘
332025	332029	332022	332022	you	211	’ replied Nicholas . ‘

332073	332082	332062	332062	you	211	’ said Newman , choking with his energy . ‘

332118	332233	332115	332115	you	211	’ cried Nicholas . It was not an easy task to arrive at this information ; but , after a great quantity of extraordinary pantomime , which in no way assisted it , Nicholas , who was almost as wild as Newman Noggs himself , forced the latter down upon his seat and held him down until he began his tale . Rage , astonishment , indignation , and a storm of passions , rushed through the listener ’s heart , as the plot was laid bare . He no sooner understood it all , than with a face of ashy paleness , and trembling in every limb , he darted from the house . ‘
332237	332246	332247	332247	He	6999	’ cried Newman , bolting out in pursuit . ‘

Domestic Intelligence of the Kenwigses and Lillyvicks Finding that Newman was determined to arrest his progress at any hazard , and apprehensive that some well - intentioned passenger , attracted by the cry of ‘
332333	332400	332270	332270	thief	7002	’ might lay violent hands upon his person , and place him in a disagreeable predicament from which he might have some difficulty in extricating himself , Nicholas soon slackened his pace , and suffered Newman Noggs to come up with him : which he did , in so breathless a condition , that it seemed impossible he could have held out for a minute longer . ‘
332409	332413	332401	332401	I	0	’ said Nicholas . ‘

332611	332743	332595	332595	I	0	’ In truth , it did seem a hopeless case . It was impossible to make any use of such intelligence as Newman Noggs had gleaned , when he lay concealed in the closet . The mere circumstance of the compact between Ralph Nickleby and Gride would not invalidate the marriage , or render Bray averse to it , who , if he did not actually know of the existence of some such understanding , doubtless suspected it . What had been hinted with reference to some fraud on Madeline , had been put , with sufficient obscurity by Arthur Gride , but coming from Newman Noggs , and obscured still further by the smoke of his pocket - pistol , it became wholly unintelligible , and involved in utter darkness . ‘

333403	333415	333400	333400	Noggs	211	‘ Not to threaten Ralph ? Not to see the father ? ’

333428	333536	333426	333426	Nicholas	207	‘ To do what , after all , is the utmost that the brothers could do , if they were here , as Heaven send they were ! To reason with her upon this hideous union , to point out to her all the horrors to which she is hastening ; rashly , it may be , and without due reflection . To entreat her , at least , to pause . She can have had no counsellor for her good . Perhaps even I may move her so far yet , though it is the eleventh hour , and she upon the very brink of ruin . ’
333537	333541	333543	333543	Newman	211	‘ Bravely spoken ! ’
333545	333557	333543	333543	Newman	211	‘ Well done , well done ! Yes . Very good . ’
333558	333564	333566	333566	Nicholas	207	‘ And I do declare , ’
333572	333628	333566	333566	Nicholas	207	‘ that in this effort I am influenced by no selfish or personal considerations , but by pity for her , and detestation and abhorrence of this scheme ; and that I would do the same , were there twenty rivals in the field , and I the last and least favoured of them all . ’
333629	333636	333638	333638	Newman	211	‘ You would , I believe , ’
333640	333648	333638	333638	Newman	211	‘ But where are you hurrying now ? ’

333656	333671	333654	333654	Nicholas	207	‘ Do you come with me , or I shall say good - night ? ’
333672	333689	333691	333691	Noggs	211	‘ I ’ll come a little way , if you will but walk : not run , ’
333693	333702	333704	333704	Nicholas	207	‘ I can not walk tonight , Newman , ’
333708	333734	333741	333741	he	7020	‘ I must move rapidly , or I could not draw my breath . I ’ll tell you what I ’ve said and done tomorrow . ’
333766	333775	333777	333777	Newman	211	‘ He ’s a violent youth at times , ’
333783	333834	333777	333777	Newman	211	‘ and yet I like him for it . There ’s cause enough now , or the deuce is in it . Hope ! I SAID hope , I think ! Ralph Nickleby and Gride with their heads together ! And hope for the opposite party ! Ho ! ho ! ’
334410	334415	334417	334418	Mrs. Kenwigs	310	‘ You ungrateful child ! ’
334420	334437	334417	334418	Mrs. Kenwigs	310	‘ after I have gone through what I have , this night , for your good . ’
334438	334447	334449	334449	Morleena	314	‘ I ca n’t help it , ma , ’

334462	334473	334475	334476	Mrs. Kenwigs	310	‘ Do n’t talk to me , you naughty thing ! ’
334478	334510	334475	334476	Mrs. Kenwigs	310	‘ do n’t ! Even if I was to trust you by yourself and you were to escape being run over , I know you ’d run in to Laura Chopkins , ’

334558	334691	334692	334692	I	0	’ Deploring the evil - mindedness of her eldest daughter in these terms , Mrs Kenwigs distilled fresh drops of vexation from her eyes , and declared that she did believe there never was anybody so tried as she was . Thereupon , Morleena Kenwigs wept afresh , and they bemoaned themselves together . Matters were at this point , as Newman Noggs was heard to limp past the door on his way upstairs ; when Mrs. Kenwigs , gaining new hope from the sound of his footsteps , hastily removed from her countenance as many traces of her late emotion as were effaceable on so short a notice : and presenting herself before him , and representing their dilemma , entreated that he would escort Morleena to the hairdresser ’s shop . ‘
334701	334706	334692	334692	I	0	’ said Mrs. Kenwigs , ‘
334782	335255	335256	335256	You	7055	’ Newman was too good - natured not to have consented , even without this avowal of confidence on the part of Mrs. Kenwigs . Accordingly , a very few minutes had elapsed , when he and Miss Morleena were on their way to the hairdresser ’s . It was not exactly a hairdresser ’s ; that is to say , people of a coarse and vulgar turn of mind might have called it a barber ’s ; for they not only cut and curled ladies elegantly , and children carefully , but shaved gentlemen easily . Still , it was a highly genteel establishment -- quite first - rate in fact -- and there were displayed in the window , besides other elegancies , waxen busts of a light lady and a dark gentleman which were the admiration of the whole neighbourhood . Indeed , some ladies had gone so far as to assert , that the dark gentleman was actually a portrait of the spirted young proprietor ; and the great similarity between their head - dresses -- both wore very glossy hair , with a narrow walk straight down the middle , and a profusion of flat circular curls on both sides -- encouraged the idea . The better informed among the sex , however , made light of this assertion , for however willing they were ( and they were very willing ) to do full justice to the handsome face and figure of the proprietor , they held the countenance of the dark gentleman in the window to be an exquisite and abstract idea of masculine beauty , realised sometimes , perhaps , among angels and military men , but very rarely embodied to gladden the eyes of mortals . It was to this establishment that Newman Noggs led Miss Kenwigs in safety . The proprietor , knowing that Miss Kenwigs had three sisters , each with two flaxen tails , and all good for sixpence apiece , once a month at least , promptly deserted an old gentleman whom he had just lathered for shaving , and handing him over to the journeyman , ( who was not very popular among the ladies , by reason of his obesity and middle age , ) waited on the young lady himself . Just as this change had been effected , there presented himself for shaving , a big , burly , good - humoured coal - heaver with a pipe in his mouth , who , drawing his hand across his chin , requested to know when a shaver would be disengaged . The journeyman , to whom this question was put , looked doubtfully at the young proprietor , and the young proprietor looked scornfully at the coal - heaver : observing at the same time : ‘
335266	335267	335256	335256	You	7055	’ ‘
335271	335278	335256	335256	You	7055	’ said the coal - heaver . ‘
335288	335294	335279	335279	We	7058	’ remarked the young proprietor . ‘
335318	335325	335297	335297	I	0	’ said the coal - heaver . ‘
335339	335344	335345	335345	We	7058	’ replied the principal . ‘
335397	335847	335390	335390	We	7058	’ The applicant stared ; grinned at Newman Noggs , who appeared highly entertained ; looked slightly round the shop , as if in depreciation of the pomatum pots and other articles of stock ; took his pipe out of his mouth and gave a very loud whistle ; and then put it in again , and walked out . The old gentleman who had just been lathered , and who was sitting in a melancholy manner with his face turned towards the wall , appeared quite unconscious of this incident , and to be insensible to everything around him in the depth of a reverie -- a very mournful one , to judge from the sighs he occasionally vented -- in which he was absorbed . Affected by this example , the proprietor began to clip Miss Kenwigs , the journeyman to scrape the old gentleman , and Newman Noggs to read last Sunday ’s paper , all three in silence : when Miss Kenwigs uttered a shrill little scream , and Newman , raising his eyes , saw that it had been elicited by the circumstance of the old gentleman turning his head , and disclosing the features of Mr. Lillyvick the collector . The features of Mr. Lillyvick they were , but strangely altered . If ever an old gentleman had made a point of appearing in public , shaved close and clean , that old gentleman was Mr. Lillyvick . If ever a collector had borne himself like a collector , and assumed , before all men , a solemn and portentous dignity as if he had the world on his books and it was all two quarters in arrear , that collector was Mr. Lillyvick . And now , there he sat , with the remains of a beard at least a week old encumbering his chin ; a soiled and crumpled shirt - frill crouching , as it were , upon his breast , instead of standing boldly out ; a demeanour so abashed and drooping , so despondent , and expressive of such humiliation , grief , and shame ; that if the souls of forty unsubstantial housekeepers , all of whom had had their water cut off for non - payment of the rate , could have been concentrated in one body , that one body could hardly have expressed such mortification and defeat as were now expressed in the person of Mr. Lillyvick the collector . Newman Noggs uttered his name , and Mr. Lillyvick groaned : then coughed to hide it . But the groan was a full - sized groan , and the cough was but a wheeze . ‘
335853	335858	335861	335861	sir	714	’ said Newman Noggs . ‘
335863	335868	335861	335861	sir	714	’ cried Mr. Lillyvick . ‘
335885	335939	335960	335960	Morleena	314	’ This speech -- the style of which Newman attributed to Mr. Lillyvick ’s recent association with theatrical characters -- not being quite explanatory , Newman looked as if he were about to ask another question , when Mr. Lillyvick prevented him by shaking his hand mournfully , and then waving his own . ‘
335945	335950	335960	335960	Morleena	314	’ said Mr. Lillyvick . ‘
335966	335967	335960	335960	Morleena	314	’ ‘
335970	335974	335960	335960	Morleena	314	’ said Newman . ‘
335985	335993	335983	335983	they	7070	’ inquired the collector . Again Newman said ‘
335996	335997	335983	335983	they	7070	’ ‘
336004	336009	336010	336010	It	7072	’ demanded the collector . ‘
336018	336028	336010	336010	It	7072	’ returned Newman , rather embarrassed by the question . ‘
336035	336040	336029	336030	Susan Kenwigs	580	’ observed the collector , ‘
336066	336097	336063	336064	Mr Noggs	211	’ This was a puzzling inquiry ; but Newman evaded it , by replying to Mr Lillyvick , that he thought the baby might possibly come like him in time . ‘
336110	336115	336104	336106	somebody like me	7075	’ said Mr. Lillyvick , ‘
336120	336121	336122	336122	You	0	’ ‘
336133	336147	336122	336122	You	0	’ said Newman . Unto which Mr. Lillyvick replied in a solemn voice , ‘
336153	336407	336122	336122	You	0	’ and again consigning himself to the hands of the journeyman , said no more . This was remarkable behaviour . So remarkable did it seem to Miss Morleena , that that young lady , at the imminent hazard of having her ear sliced off , had not been able to forbear looking round , some score of times , during the foregoing colloquy . Of her , however , Mr. Lillyvick took no notice : rather striving ( so , at least , it seemed to Newman Noggs ) to evade her observation , and to shrink into himself whenever he attracted her regards . Newman wondered very much what could have occasioned this altered behaviour on the part of the collector ; but , philosophically reflecting that he would most likely know , sooner or later , and that he could perfectly afford to wait , he was very little disturbed by the singularity of the old gentleman ’s deportment . The cutting and curling being at last concluded , the old gentleman , who had been some time waiting , rose to go , and , walking out with Newman and his charge , took Newman ’s arm , and proceeded for some time without making any observation . Newman , who in power of taciturnity was excelled by few people , made no attempt to break silence ; and so they went on , until they had very nearly reached Miss Morleena ’s home , when Mr Lillyvick said : ‘
336422	336423	336415	336416	Mr. Noggs	211	’ ‘
336427	336431	336415	336416	Mr. Noggs	211	’ returned Newman . ‘
336438	336439	336440	336440	Married	7076	’ ‘
336442	336446	336440	336440	Married	7076	’ suggested Newman . ‘
336449	336467	336440	336440	Married	7076	’ replied Mr. Lillyvick , with another groan ; this time not even disguised by a wheeze . ‘
336477	336482	336473	336473	she	7077	’ interposed Miss Morleena , ‘
336521	336522	336524	336524	you	0	’ ‘
336542	336551	336554	336555	uncle Lillyvick	316	’ said the collector , with some hesitation . ‘
336560	336574	336557	336557	I	0	’ returned Miss Morleena , with the energy of both her parents combined ; ‘
336596	336699	336700	336700	Kenwigs	310	’ Immediately upon the utterance of these words , Mr. Lillyvick caught Miss Morleena up in his arms , and kissed her ; and , being by this time at the door of the house where Mr. Kenwigs lodged ( which , as has been before mentioned , usually stood wide open ) , he walked straight up into Mr Kenwigs ’s sitting - room , and put Miss Morleena down in the midst . Mr. and Mrs. Kenwigs were at supper . At sight of their perjured relative , Mrs Kenwigs turned faint and pale , and Mr. Kenwigs rose majestically . ‘
336702	336707	336700	336700	Kenwigs	310	’ said the collector , ‘
336711	336712	336713	336713	Sir	714	’ ‘
336715	336720	336713	336713	Sir	714	’ said Mr. Kenwigs , ‘
336752	336757	336750	336750	sir	714	’ said Mr. Kenwigs , ‘
336817	336818	336819	336820	Susan Kenwigs	580	’ ‘
336822	336833	336836	336836	you	580	’ said Mr. Lillyvick , turning humbly to his niece , ‘
336842	336843	336836	336836	you	580	’ ‘
336853	336863	336851	336851	sir	714	’ said Mr. Kenwigs , striking the table emphatically . ‘

336901	336908	336897	336897	I	0	’ said the poor collector meekly , ‘
336924	336949	336950	336950	My	0	’ This was touching the Kenwigses on their tenderest point . Mrs. Kenwigs instantly burst into tears , and Mr. Kenwigs evinced great emotion . ‘
336962	336969	336999	336999	he	7096	’ said Mr Kenwigs , mournfully , ‘
337194	337234	337235	337235	Uncle	8733	’ This affecting picture moved Mrs. Kenwigs deeply . After several imperfect words , which vainly attempted to struggle to the surface , but were drowned and washed away by the strong tide of her tears , she spake . ‘
337237	337242	337235	337235	Uncle	8733	’ said Mrs. Kenwigs , ‘
337323	337324	337303	337304	little Lillyvick	316	’ ‘

337386	337391	337380	337380	My	0	’ said Mrs. Kenwigs , ‘
337481	337482	337483	337483	Susan	580	’ ‘
337488	337493	337473	337473	I	0	’ said Mr. Kenwigs , ‘
337498	337499	337473	337473	I	0	’ ‘
337502	337507	337473	337473	I	0	’ shrieked Mrs. Kenwigs , ‘
337546	337666	337667	337667	I	0	’ And , here , the emotions of Mrs. Kenwigs became so violent , that Mr. Kenwigs was fain to administer hartshorn internally , and vinegar externally , and to destroy a staylace , four petticoat strings , and several small buttons . Newman had been a silent spectator of this scene ; for Mr. Lillyvick had signed to him not to withdraw , and Mr. Kenwigs had further solicited his presence by a nod of invitation . When Mrs. Kenwigs had been , in some degree , restored , and Newman , as a person possessed of some influence with her , had remonstrated and begged her to compose herself , Mr Lillyvick said in a faltering voice : ‘
337707	337715	337698	337698	she	310	’ Mr. and Mrs. Kenwigs started together . ‘
337724	337729	337698	337698	she	310	’ repeated Mr. Lillyvick , ‘
337763	337772	337774	337774	I	0	’ said Mr. Lillyvick , looking sternly round , ‘
337794	338051	337786	337786	I	0	’ This declaration completely changed the whole posture of affairs . Mrs. Kenwigs threw herself upon the old gentleman ’s neck , bitterly reproaching herself for her late harshness , and exclaiming , if she had suffered , what must his sufferings have been ! Mr. Kenwigs grasped his hand , and vowed eternal friendship and remorse . Mrs. Kenwigs was horror - stricken to think that she should ever have nourished in her bosom such a snake , adder , viper , serpent , and base crocodile as Henrietta Petowker . Mr. Kenwigs argued that she must have been bad indeed not to have improved by so long a contemplation of Mrs. Kenwigs ’s virtue . Mrs. Kenwigs remembered that Mr. Kenwigs had often said that he was not quite satisfied of the propriety of Miss Petowker ’s conduct , and wondered how it was that she could have been blinded by such a wretch . Mr. Kenwigs remembered that he had had his suspicions , but did not wonder why Mrs. Kenwigs had not had hers , as she was all chastity , purity , and truth , and Henrietta all baseness , falsehood , and deceit . And Mr. and Mrs. Kenwigs both said , with strong feelings and tears of sympathy , that everything happened for the best ; and conjured the good collector not to give way to unavailing grief , but to seek consolation in the society of those affectionate relations whose arms and hearts were ever open to him . ‘
338064	338069	337786	337786	I	0	’ said Mr Lillyvick , ‘
338121	338157	338166	338167	Mr. Kenwigs	312	‘ em in my will . The deed shall be executed tomorrow , and Mr. Noggs shall be one of the witnesses . He hears me promise this , and he shall see it done . ’
338256	338260	338262	338263	Mr. Lillyvick	316	‘ And now , ’
338281	338411	338262	338263	Mr. Lillyvick	316	‘ give me some supper . This took place twenty mile from town . I came up this morning , and have being lingering about all day , without being able to make up my mind to come and see you . I humoured her in everything , she had her own way , she did just as she pleased , and now she has done this . There was twelve teaspoons and twenty - four pound in sovereigns -- I missed them first -- it ’s a trial -- I feel I shall never be able to knock a double knock again , when I go my rounds -- don’t say anything more about it , please -- the spoons were worth -- never mind -- never mind ! ’
338524	338531	338533	338534	Mr. Kenwigs	312	‘ When I see that man , ’
338581	338665	338571	338571	Morleena	314	‘ when I see that man as mingling , once again , in the spear which he adorns , and see his affections deweloping themselves in legitimate sitiwations , I feel that his nature is as elewated and expanded , as his standing afore society as a public character is unimpeached , and the woices of my infant children purvided for in life , seem to whisper to me softly , “ This is an ewent at which Evins itself looks down ! ” ’
339428	340278	340285	340285	you	714	’ heads , and but for which they might have earned their honest bread and lived in peace ; how many died in soul , and had no chance of life ; how many who could scarcely go astray , be they vicious as they would , turned haughtily from the crushed and stricken wretch who could scarce do otherwise , and who would have been a greater wonder had he or she done well , than even they had they done ill ; how much injustice , misery , and wrong , there was , and yet how the world rolled on , from year to year , alike careless and indifferent , and no man seeking to remedy or redress it ; when he thought of all this , and selected from the mass the one slight case on which his thoughts were bent , he felt , indeed , that there was little ground for hope , and little reason why it should not form an atom in the huge aggregate of distress and sorrow , and add one small and unimportant unit to swell the great amount . But youth is not prone to contemplate the darkest side of a picture it can shift at will . By dint of reflecting on what he had to do , and reviving the train of thought which night had interrupted , Nicholas gradually summoned up his utmost energy , and when the morning was sufficiently advanced for his purpose , had no thought but that of using it to the best advantage . A hasty breakfast taken , and such affairs of business as required prompt attention disposed of , he directed his steps to the residence of Madeline Bray : whither he lost no time in arriving . It had occurred to him that , very possibly , the young lady might be denied , although to him she never had been ; and he was still pondering upon the surest method of obtaining access to her in that case , when , coming to the door of the house , he found it had been left ajar -- probably by the last person who had gone out . The occasion was not one upon which to observe the nicest ceremony ; therefore , availing himself of this advantage , Nicholas walked gently upstairs and knocked at the door of the room into which he had been accustomed to be shown . Receiving permission to enter , from some person on the other side , he opened the door and walked in . Bray and his daughter were sitting there alone . It was nearly three weeks since he had seen her last , but there was a change in the lovely girl before him which told Nicholas , in startling terms , how much mental suffering had been compressed into that short time . There are no words which can express , nothing with which can be compared , the perfect pallor , the clear transparent whiteness , of the beautiful face which turned towards him when he entered . Her hair was a rich deep brown , but shading that face , and straying upon a neck that rivalled it in whiteness , it seemed by the strong contrast raven black . Something of wildness and restlessness there was in the dark eye , but there was the same patient look , the same expression of gentle mournfulness which he well remembered , and no trace of a single tear . Most beautiful -- more beautiful , perhaps , than ever -- there was something in her face which quite unmanned him , and appeared far more touching than the wildest agony of grief . It was not merely calm and composed , but fixed and rigid , as though the violent effort which had summoned that composure beneath her father ’s eye , while it mastered all other thoughts , had prevented even the momentary expression they had communicated to the features from subsiding , and had fastened it there , as an evidence of its triumph . The father sat opposite to her ; not looking directly in her face , but glancing at her , as he talked with a gay air which ill disguised the anxiety of his thoughts . The drawing materials were not on their accustomed table , nor were any of the other tokens of her usual occupations to be seen . The little vases which Nicholas had always seen filled with fresh flowers were empty , or supplied only with a few withered stalks and leaves . The bird was silent . The cloth that covered his cage at night was not removed . His mistress had forgotten him . There are times when , the mind being painfully alive to receive impressions , a great deal may be noted at a glance . This was one , for Nicholas had but glanced round him when he was recognised by Mr. Bray , who said impatiently : ‘
340331	340440	340441	340441	Madeline	542	’ Nicholas could very well discern that the irritability and impatience of this speech were assumed , and that Bray , in his heart , was rejoiced at any interruption which promised to engage the attention of his daughter . He bent his eyes involuntarily upon the father as he spoke , and marked his uneasiness ; for he coloured and turned his head away . The device , however , so far as it was a device for causing Madeline to interfere , was successful . She rose , and advancing towards Nicholas paused half - way , and stretched out her hand as expecting a letter . ‘
340443	340449	340441	340441	Madeline	542	’ said her father impatiently , ‘
340458	340459	340455	340455	you	542	’ ‘
340467	340484	340460	340461	Miss Bray	542	’ said Nicholas , speaking very distinctly , and with an emphasis she could scarcely misunderstand . ‘
340521	340522	340514	340514	I	0	’ ‘
340533	340538	340539	340539	you	542	’ said Mr. Bray , ‘
340564	340565	340557	340558	this person	8988	’ ‘
340574	340580	340557	340558	this person	8988	’ returned Madeline , faintly . ‘
340587	340599	340571	340571	I	0	’ said Bray , wheeling his chair round and confronting Nicholas , ‘
340629	340630	340631	340631	I	0	’ ‘
340638	340642	340631	340631	I	0	’ returned Nicholas . ‘
340650	340655	340656	340656	You	542	’ sneered the invalid . ‘
340727	340728	340729	340729	My	0	’ ‘
340732	340737	340729	340729	My	0	’ said Nicholas respectfully , ‘
340743	340744	340729	340729	My	0	’ ‘
340753	340759	340729	340729	My	0	’ returned the sick man , ‘
340787	340848	340785	340785	sir	714	’ Nicholas understood the tone of triumph in which this interrogatory was put ; but remembering the necessity of supporting his assumed character , produced a scrap of paper purporting to contain a list of some subjects for drawings which his employer desired to have executed ; and with which he had prepared himself in case of any such contingency . ‘
340851	340856	340785	340785	sir	714	’ said Mr. Bray . ‘
340865	340866	340785	340785	sir	714	’ ‘
340878	340882	340868	340868	you	714	’ replied Nicholas . ‘
340890	340905	340884	340884	you	542	’ said Bray , tossing the paper back again , with an exulting smile , ‘
341011	341012	341003	341003	my	0	’ ‘
341033	341071	341026	341026	he	9982	’ thought Nicholas . The father was too much absorbed with his own exultation to mark the look of scorn which , for an instant , Nicholas could not have suppressed had he been upon the rack . ‘
341074	341083	341026	341026	he	9982	’ he continued , after a short silence , ‘
341102	341103	341104	341104	I	0	’ ‘
341108	341112	341104	341104	I	0	’ said Nicholas ; ‘
341234	341235	341218	341218	Your	7197	’ ‘
341241	341251	341218	341218	Your	7197	’ cried Madeline , interposing in alarm between them . ‘
341260	341261	341256	341256	he	7201	’ ‘
341264	341275	341276	341276	Ill	584	’ cried the invalid , gasping and catching for breath . ‘
341304	341411	341292	341292	she	7203	’ He fell into a paroxysm of his disorder , so violent that for a few moments Nicholas was alarmed for his life ; but finding that he began to recover , he withdrew , after signifying by a gesture to the young lady that he had something important to communicate , and would wait for her outside the room . He could hear that the sick man came gradually , but slowly , to himself , and that without any reference to what had just occurred , as though he had no distinct recollection of it as yet , he requested to be left alone . ‘
341414	341418	341292	341292	she	7203	’ thought Nicholas , ‘
341446	341447	341448	341448	You	0	’ ‘
341459	341469	341457	341457	sir	714	’ said Madeline , presenting herself in great agitation . ‘
341491	341492	341476	341476	I	0	’ ‘
341508	341512	341503	341503	I	0	’ rejoined Nicholas , ‘
341565	341578	341558	341558	you	0	’ She attempted to pass him , but Nicholas gently detained her . ‘
341582	341586	341558	341558	you	0	’ said Nicholas . ‘
341625	341675	341621	341621	Heaven	195	’ The poor attendant , with her eyes swollen and red with weeping , stood by ; and to her Nicholas appealed in such passionate terms that she opened a side - door , and , supporting her mistress into an adjoining room , beckoned Nicholas to follow them . ‘
341683	341689	341679	341679	sir	714	’ said the young lady . ‘
341700	341704	341690	341690	I	0	’ returned Nicholas . ‘
341755	341756	341761	341761	you	0	’ ‘
341772	341785	341761	341761	you	0	’ demanded the young lady , with an effort to speak proudly . ‘
341792	341796	341786	341786	I	0	’ returned Nicholas , ‘
341909	341910	341911	341911	You	0	’ ‘
341920	341924	341913	341913	you	0	’ said Madeline , ‘
341940	341941	341934	341934	Heaven	195	’ ‘
341950	341954	341934	341934	Heaven	195	’ replied Nicholas , ‘
341970	341971	341972	341972	I	0	’ ‘
341978	342005	341972	341972	I	0	’ cried the young lady , striving to repress a shudder , occasioned , as it seemed , even by this slight allusion to Arthur Gride . ‘
342052	342056	342068	342068	you	0	’ said Madeline , ‘
342084	342085	342088	342088	I	0	’ ‘
342105	342109	342088	342088	I	0	’ cried Nicholas , ‘
342352	342398	342399	342399	I	0	’ Long before Nicholas ceased to speak , the young lady buried her face in her hands , and gave her tears free way . In a voice at first inarticulate with emotion , but gradually recovering strength as she proceeded , she answered him : ‘
342750	342751	342752	342752	Your	7230	’ ‘
342762	342766	342757	342757	you	7230	’ said Nicholas , ‘
342799	342800	342801	342801	He	7231	’ ‘
342845	342853	342806	342806	you	7230	’ said Madeline , with momentary firmness , ‘
342901	342902	342892	342892	I	0	’ ‘
342914	342918	342919	342919	I	0	’ cried Nicholas . ‘
342925	342931	342932	342932	I	0	’ said Madeline , hurriedly ; ‘
343021	343055	343006	343008	all holy angels	7235	’ She was hurrying past Nicholas , when he threw himself before her , and implored her to think , but once again , upon the fate to which she was precipitately hastening . ‘
343061	343071	343006	343008	all holy angels	7235	’ said Nicholas , in an agony of supplication ; ‘
343113	343114	343107	343107	I	0	’ ‘
343117	343122	343107	343107	I	0	’ she incoherently replied . ‘
343177	343178	343163	343163	I	0	’ ‘
343185	343199	343158	343158	him	7237	’ said Nicholas , with the same violent rapidity with which she spoke , ‘
343254	343255	343279	343279	He	7237	’ ‘
343284	343285	343279	343279	He	7237	’ ‘
343299	343303	343279	343279	He	7237	’ said Nicholas , ‘
343317	343318	343279	343279	He	7237	’ ‘
343325	343335	343279	343279	He	7237	’ replied Madeline , not heeding what she said . ‘
343383	343568	343369	343369	God	225	’ She was gone . Nicholas , staggering from the house , thought of the hurried scene which had just closed upon him , as if it were the phantom of some wild , unquiet dream . The day wore on ; at night , having been enabled in some measure to collect his thoughts , he issued forth again . That night , being the last of Arthur Gride ’s bachelorship , found him in tiptop spirits and great glee . The bottle - green suit had been brushed , ready for the morrow . Peg Sliderskew had rendered the accounts of her past housekeeping ; the eighteen - pence had been rigidly accounted for ( she was never trusted with a larger sum at once , and the accounts were not usually balanced more than twice a day ) ; every preparation had been made for the coming festival ; and Arthur might have sat down and contemplated his approaching happiness , but that he preferred sitting down and contemplating the entries in a dirty old vellum - book with rusty clasps . ‘
343575	343613	343369	343369	God	225	’ he chuckled , as sinking on his knees before a strong chest screwed down to the floor , he thrust in his arm nearly up to the shoulder , and slowly drew forth this greasy volume . ‘
343729	343765	343723	343723	He	548	’ Muttering this soliloquy , Arthur carried his precious volume to the table , and , adjusting it upon a dusty desk , put on his spectacles , and began to pore among the leaves . ‘
343775	343784	343772	343773	Mr. Nickleby	208	’ he said , in a dolorous voice . ‘
343917	344023	343894	343894	I	0	’ These reflections depressed the old usurer so much , as to wring a feeble groan or two from his breast , and cause him to declare , with uplifted hands , that he would die in a workhouse . Remembering on further cogitation , however , that under any circumstances he must have paid , or handsomely compounded for , Ralph ’s debt , and being by no means confident that he would have succeeded had he undertaken his enterprise alone , he regained his equanimity , and chattered and mowed over more satisfactory items , until the entrance of Peg Sliderskew interrupted him . ‘
344028	344032	344026	344026	Peg	576	’ said Arthur , ‘
344044	344045	344042	344042	Peg	576	’ ‘
344051	344081	344042	344042	Peg	576	’ replied Peg , holding up a plate containing a little , a very little one . Quite a phenomenon of a fowl . So very small and skinny . ‘
344086	344103	344042	344042	Peg	576	’ said Arthur , after inquiring the price , and finding it proportionate to the size . ‘
344164	344165	344157	344157	Peg	576	’ ‘
344175	344182	344168	344168	you	576	’ said Mrs. Sliderskew , sulkily . ‘
344195	344203	344224	344224	I	0	’ returned Arthur , with a groan , ‘
344247	344248	344243	344243	you	576	’ ‘
344254	344258	344251	344251	I	0	’ said Peg . ‘
344265	344266	344260	344260	your	576	’ ‘
344275	344279	344260	344260	your	576	’ said Peg . ‘
344292	344296	344260	344260	your	576	’ cried Arthur : ‘
344312	344313	344260	344260	your	576	’ ‘
344318	344322	344315	344315	his	6948	’ said Peg . ‘
344341	344345	344326	344326	she	14827	’ whined Gride . ‘
344353	344395	344326	344326	she	14827	’ The last - mentioned tribute to the charms of Mrs. Sliderskew being uttered in a whisper , that lady assented to the general proposition by a harsh growl , which was accompanied by a ring at the street - door . ‘
344401	344405	344326	344326	she	14827	’ said Arthur . ‘
344414	344418	344410	344410	I	0	’ rejoined Peg . ‘
344426	344430	344423	344423	you	576	’ bawled Arthur . ‘
344434	344438	344439	344439	I	0	’ retorted Peg . ‘
344450	344458	344439	344439	I	0	’ Arthur Gride in reply repeated the word ‘
344460	344542	344439	344439	I	0	’ as loud as he could roar ; and , his meaning being rendered further intelligible to Mrs. Sliderskew ’s dull sense of hearing by pantomime expressive of ringing at a street - door , Peg hobbled out , after sharply demanding why he had n’t said there was a ring before , instead of talking about all manner of things that had nothing to do with it , and keeping her half - pint of beer waiting on the steps . ‘
344554	344565	344551	344552	Mrs. Peg	576	’ said Arthur , following her out with his eyes . ‘
344622	344830	344831	344831	Thieves	14802	’ Turning over the leaves of his book as he muttered this , he soon lighted upon something which attracted his attention , and forgot Peg Sliderskew and everything else in the engrossing interest of its pages . The room had no other light than that which it derived from a dim and dirt - clogged lamp , whose lazy wick , being still further obscured by a dark shade , cast its feeble rays over a very little space , and left all beyond in heavy shadow . This lamp the money - lender had drawn so close to him , that there was only room between it and himself for the book over which he bent ; and as he sat , with his elbows on the desk , and his sharp cheek - bones resting on his hands , it only served to bring out his ugly features in strong relief , together with the little table at which he sat , and to shroud all the rest of the chamber in a deep sullen gloom . Raising his eyes , and looking vacantly into this gloom as he made some mental calculation , Arthur Gride suddenly met the fixed gaze of a man . ‘
344835	344850	344851	344851	Robbers	7263	’ shrieked the usurer , starting up and folding his book to his breast . ‘

344862	344869	344851	344851	Robbers	7263	’ said the form , advancing . ‘
344873	344879	344851	344851	Robbers	7263	’ cried the trembling wretch . ‘
344888	344889	344851	344851	Robbers	7263	’ ‘
344903	344908	344893	344893	you	7265	’ was the inquiry . ‘
344913	344925	344893	344893	you	7265	’ cried Arthur Gride , shading his eyes with his hand , ‘
344945	344946	344943	344943	robbers	7263	’ ‘
344968	344979	344980	344980	I	0	’ said the stranger , coming close up to him . ‘
344985	344986	344980	344980	I	0	’ ‘
344996	345010	344993	344993	you	7265	’ cried Gride , somewhat reassured , but still retreating from his visitor : ‘
345022	345023	345019	345019	you	7265	’ ‘
345031	345036	345019	345019	you	7265	’ was the reply . ‘
345106	345176	345088	345088	I	0	’ Arthur Gride , venturing to regard his visitor more attentively , and perceiving that he was a young man of good mien and bearing , returned to his seat , and muttering that there were bad characters about , and that this , with former attempts upon his house , had made him nervous , requested his visitor to sit down . This , however , he declined . ‘
345192	345215	345218	345218	me	0	’ said Nicholas ( for Nicholas it was ) , as he observed a gesture of alarm on the part of Gride . ‘
345228	345229	345220	345220	You	7265	’ ‘
345236	345240	345220	345220	You	7265	’ rejoined Gride . ‘
345252	345253	345248	345248	you	0	’ ‘
345258	345262	345263	345263	I	0	’ replied Nicholas , ‘
345321	345344	345319	345319	her	7275	’ Gride looked at him as if he were petrified with astonishment , but did not speak ; perhaps lacking the power . ‘
345362	345366	345367	345367	You	7265	’ pursued Nicholas . ‘
345396	345410	345393	345393	I	0	’ He paused ; but , Arthur making no reply , resumed again . ‘
345533	345548	345550	345550	you	7265	’ He paused again , and still Arthur Gride glared upon him in silence . ‘
345569	345573	345574	345574	I	0	’ said Nicholas , ‘
345695	345715	345716	345716	You	7265	’ Old Arthur Gride moved his lips , but they only formed an ugly smile and were motionless again . ‘
345719	345723	345716	345716	You	7265	’ said Nicholas , ‘
345784	345976	345780	345780	you	7265	’ When Nicholas began , Arthur Gride ’s impression was , that Ralph Nickleby had betrayed him ; but , as he proceeded , he felt convinced that however he had come by the knowledge he possessed , the part he acted was a genuine one , and that with Ralph he had no concern . All he seemed to know , for certain , was , that he , Gride , paid Ralph ’s debt ; but that , to anybody who knew the circumstances of Bray ’s detention -- even to Bray himself , on Ralph ’s own statement -- must be perfectly notorious . As to the fraud on Madeline herself , his visitor knew so little about its nature or extent , that it might be a lucky guess , or a hap - hazard accusation . Whether or no , he had clearly no key to the mystery , and could not hurt him who kept it close within his own breast . The allusion to friends , and the offer of money , Gride held to be mere empty vapouring , for purposes of delay . ‘
345986	346007	345780	345780	you	7265	’ thought Arthur Gride , as he glanced at Nicholas , and trembled with passion at his boldness and audacity , ‘
346029	346130	346133	346133	you	7283	’ Long habit of weighing and noting well what clients said , and nicely balancing chances in his mind and calculating odds to their faces , without the least appearance of being so engaged , had rendered Gride quick in forming conclusions , and arriving , from puzzling , intricate , and often contradictory premises , at very cunning deductions . Hence it was that , as Nicholas went on , he followed him closely with his own constructions , and , when he ceased to speak , was as well prepared as if he had deliberated for a fortnight . ‘
346135	346160	346131	346131	I	0	’ he cried , starting from his seat , casting back the fastenings of the window - shutters , and throwing up the sash . ‘
346168	346169	346172	346172	you	7283	’ ‘
346175	346185	346172	346172	you	7283	’ said Nicholas , seizing him by the arm . ‘
346224	346237	346238	346238	I	0	’ replied Gride , drawing in his head with a frightful grin , ‘
346241	346242	346238	346238	I	0	’ ‘
346245	346249	346243	346243	Wretch	305	’ cried Nicholas . ‘
346259	346281	346257	346257	you	7283	’ said Gride , whom jealousy of Nicholas and a sense of his own triumph had converted into a perfect fiend . ‘
346353	346354	346347	346347	She	7289	’ ‘
346357	346366	346355	346355	Villain	12950	’ said Nicholas , choking with his rage . ‘
346371	346376	346355	346355	Villain	12950	’ cried Arthur Gride , ‘
346408	346409	346406	346406	Madeline	542	’ ‘
346413	346417	346406	346406	Madeline	542	’ said Nicholas . ‘
346425	346426	346422	346424	a younger man--	7295	’ ‘
346430	346435	346422	346424	a younger man--	7295	’ sneered Arthur Gride , ‘
346468	346469	346471	346471	me	0	’ ‘
346473	346477	346471	346471	me	0	’ said Nicholas , ‘
346543	346544	346535	346535	She	9409	’ ‘
346562	346567	346553	346553	I	0	’ said Arthur Gride . ‘
346619	346740	346600	346607	the poor youth that wanted to have her	7302	’ This taunt brought such an expression into the face of Nicholas , that Arthur Gride plainly apprehended it to be the forerunner of his putting his threat of throwing him into the street in immediate execution ; for he thrust his head out of the window , and holding tight on with both hands , raised a pretty brisk alarm . Not thinking it necessary to abide the issue of the noise , Nicholas gave vent to an indignant defiance , and stalked from the room and from the house . Arthur Gride watched him across the street , and then , drawing in his head , fastened the window as before , and sat down to take breath . ‘
346759	346768	346751	346751	I	0	’ he said , when he had recovered . ‘
346802	346870	346801	346801	I	0	’m glad nobody came . I did n’t call too loud . The audacity to enter my house , and open upon me ! But I shall have a very good triumph tomorrow , and he ’ll be gnawing his fingers off : perhaps drown himself or cut his throat ! I should n’t wonder ! That would make it quite complete , that would : quite . ’
346979	346983	346985	346985	Arthur	548	‘ Top bolt , ’
346992	347052	346985	346985	Arthur	548	‘ bottom bolt , chain , bar , double lock , and key out to put under my pillow ! So , if any more rejected admirers come , they may come through the keyhole . And now I ’ll go to sleep till half - past five , when I must get up to be married , Peg ! ’
347338	347341	347343	347343	Peg	576	‘ Faugh ! ’
347366	347435	347343	347343	Peg	576	‘ Wedding indeed ! A precious wedding ! He wants somebody better than his old Peg to take care of him , does he ? And what has he said to me , many and many a time , to keep me content with short food , small wages , and little fire ? “ My will , Peg ! my will ! ” says he : “ I ’m
347523	347574	347575	347575	I	0	’ While Mrs. Sliderskew , influenced possibly by some lingering feelings of disappointment and personal slight , occasioned by her old master ’s preference for another , was giving loose to these grumblings below stairs , Arthur Gride was cogitating in the parlour upon what had taken place last night . ‘
347589	347593	347580	347580	he	9319	’ said Arthur , ‘
347674	347865	347658	347658	he	9319	’ Ralph was universally looked up to , and recognised among his fellows as a superior genius , but upon Arthur Gride his stern unyielding character and consummate art had made so deep an impression , that he was actually afraid of him . Cringing and cowardly to the core by nature , Arthur Gride humbled himself in the dust before Ralph Nickleby , and , even when they had not this stake in common , would have licked his shoes and crawled upon the ground before him rather than venture to return him word for word , or retort upon him in any other spirit than one of the most slavish and abject sycophancy . To Ralph Nickleby ’s , Arthur Gride now betook himself according to appointment ; and to Ralph Nickleby he related how , last night , some young blustering blade , whom he had never seen , forced his way into his house , and tried to frighten him from the proposed nuptials . Told , in short , what Nicholas had said and done , with the slight reservation upon which he had determined . ‘
347872	347876	347658	347658	he	9319	’ said Ralph . ‘
347882	347886	347658	347658	he	9319	’ rejoined Gride . ‘
347893	347897	347887	347887	He	7327	’ said Ralph , ‘
347909	347910	347911	347911	I	0	’ ‘
347920	347924	347911	347911	I	0	’ replied Gride . ‘
347958	347959	347946	347946	he	7327	’ ‘
347962	347970	347946	347946	he	7327	’ said Ralph , eyeing him askew . ‘
347974	347975	347976	347976	Dear	207	’ ‘
347982	347994	347976	347976	Dear	207	’ cried Arthur , rubbing his hands and affecting to laugh . ‘
348004	348008	347997	347997	you	7328	’ said Ralph ; ‘
348020	348021	348017	348017	I	0	’ ‘
348046	348052	348035	348035	You	7328	’ cried Arthur , faltering . ‘
348059	348060	348054	348054	you	7328	’ ‘
348068	348072	348075	348077	an old man	12564	’ returned Ralph . ‘
348110	348111	348100	348100	you	7328	’ ‘
348114	348119	348100	348100	you	7328	’ snarled Arthur Gride . ‘
348122	348126	348129	348129	you	7328	’ rejoined Ralph , ‘
348188	348189	348179	348179	he	7335	’ ‘
348197	348201	348203	348203	he	7332	’ replied Gride , ‘
348219	348222	348203	348203	he	7332	‘ em . ’
348223	348227	348229	348229	Ralph	208	‘ He said ! ’
348233	348319	348229	348229	Ralph	208	‘ But I like him for one thing , and that is , his giving you this fair warning to keep your -- what is it?--Tit - tit or dainty chick -- which?--under lock and key . Be careful , Gride , be careful . It ’s a triumph , too , to tear her away from a gallant young rival : a great triumph for an old man ! It only remains to keep her safe when you have her -- that ’s all . ’
348320	348327	348329	348330	Arthur Gride	548	‘ What a man it is ! ’
348353	348374	348348	348348	he	548	‘ Yes ; to keep her safe , that ’s all . And that is n’t much , is it ? ’
348375	348378	348380	348380	Ralph	208	‘ Much ! ’
348386	348434	348380	348380	Ralph	208	‘ Why , everybody knows what easy things to understand and to control , women are . But come , it ’s very nearly time for you to be made happy . You ’ll pay the bond now , I suppose , to save us trouble afterwards . ’
348435	348443	348445	348445	Arthur	548	‘ Oh what a man you are ! ’
348447	348451	348453	348453	Ralph	208	‘ Why not ? ’
348455	348477	348453	348453	Ralph	208	‘ Nobody will pay you interest for the money , I suppose , between this and twelve o’clock ; will they ? ’
348478	348492	348494	348494	Arthur	548	‘ But nobody would pay you interest for it either , you know , ’
348512	348516	348518	348518	Ralph	208	‘ Besides which , ’
348529	348586	348518	348518	Ralph	208	‘ you have n’t the money about you , and you were n’t prepared for this , or you ’d have brought it with you ; and there ’s nobody you ’d so much like to accommodate as me . I see . We trust each other in about an equal degree . Are you ready ? ’
348764	348769	348771	348771	Ralph	208	‘ One would think , ’
348787	348802	348771	348771	Ralph	208	‘ that there was a funeral going on here , and not a wedding . ’
348803	348808	348810	348811	his friend	780	‘ He , he ! ’
348813	348822	348810	348811	his friend	780	‘ you are so -- so very funny ! ’
348823	348828	348830	348830	Ralph	208	‘ I need be , ’
348834	348856	348830	348830	Ralph	208	‘ for this is rather dull and chilling . Look a little brisker , man , and not so hangdog like ! ’
348857	348865	348867	348867	Gride	548	‘ Yes , yes , I will , ’
348869	348887	348867	348867	Gride	548	‘ But -- but -- you do n’t think she ’s coming just yet , do you ? ’
348888	348902	348904	348904	Ralph	208	‘ Why , I suppose she ’ll not come till she is obliged , ’
348911	348928	348904	348904	Ralph	208	‘ and she has a good half - hour to spare yet . Curb your impatience . ’
348929	348938	348940	348940	Arthur	548	‘ I -- I -- am not impatient , ’
348942	348983	348940	348940	Arthur	548	‘ I would n’t be hard with her for the world . Oh dear , dear , not on any account . Let her take her time -- her own time . Her time shall be ours by all means . ’
349053	349056	349057	349057	he	208	‘ Hush ! ’
349065	349107	349057	349057	he	208	‘ She was very ill last night . I thought she would have broken her heart . She is dressed , and crying bitterly in her own room ; but she ’s better , and quite quiet . That ’s everything ! ’
349108	349116	349118	349118	Ralph	208	‘ She is ready , is she ? ’
349120	349124	349118	349118	Ralph	208	‘ Quite ready , ’
349129	349149	349151	349151	Ralph	208	‘ And not likely to delay us by any young - lady weaknesses -- fainting , or so forth ? ’
349153	349161	349163	349163	Bray	542	‘ She may be safely trusted now , ’
349165	349183	349184	349184	He	208	‘ I have been talking to her this morning . Here ! Come a little this way . ’
349243	349249	349251	349251	Bray	542	‘ Look at that man , ’
349255	349265	349251	349251	Bray	542	‘ This seems a cruel thing , after all . ’
349266	349273	349275	349275	Ralph	208	‘ What seems a cruel thing ? ’
349298	349302	349304	349304	Bray	542	‘ This marriage , ’
349306	349321	349304	349304	Bray	542	‘ Do n’t ask me what . You know as well as I do . ’
349384	349395	349397	349397	Bray	542	‘ Look at him . Does it not seem cruel ? ’
349399	349402	349404	349404	Ralph	208	‘ No ! ’
349408	349414	349416	349416	Bray	542	‘ I say it does , ’
349425	349440	349416	349416	Bray	542	‘ It is a cruel thing , by all that ’s bad and treacherous ! ’
349574	349589	349591	349591	Ralph	208	‘ You see what a dry , shrivelled , withered old chip it is , ’
349601	349650	349591	349591	Ralph	208	‘ If he were younger , it might be cruel , but as it is -- harkee , Mr. Bray , he ’ll die soon , and leave her a rich young widow ! Miss Madeline consults your tastes this time ; let her consult her own next . ’
349651	349656	349658	349658	Bray	543	‘ True , true , ’
349671	349709	349658	349658	Bray	543	‘ I could n’t do anything better for her than advise her to accept these proposals , could I ? Now , I ask you , Nickleby , as a man of the world ; could I ? ’
349710	349714	349716	349716	Ralph	208	‘ Surely not , ’
349718	349779	349716	349716	Ralph	208	‘ I tell you what , sir ; there are a hundred fathers , within a circuit of five miles from this place ; well off ; good , rich , substantial men ; who would gladly give their daughters , and their own ears with them , to that very man yonder , ape and mummy as he looks . ’
349780	349785	349787	349787	Bray	543	‘ So there are ! ’
349800	349813	349787	349787	Bray	543	‘ And so I told her , both last night and today . ’
349814	349820	349822	349822	Ralph	208	‘ You told her truth , ’
349824	349896	349822	349822	Ralph	208	‘ and did well to do so ; though I must say , at the same time , that if I had a daughter , and my freedom , pleasure , nay , my very health and life , depended on her taking a husband whom I pointed out , I should hope it would not be necessary to advance any other arguments to induce her to consent to my wishes . ’
349929	350065	349897	349897	Bray	543	‘ I must go upstairs for a few minutes , to finish dressing . When I come down , I ’ll bring Madeline with me . Do you know , I had a very strange dream last night , which I have not remembered till this instant . I dreamt that it was this morning , and you and I had been talking as we have been this minute ; that I went upstairs , for the very purpose for which I am going now ; and that as I stretched out my hand to take Madeline ’s , and lead her down , the floor sunk with me , and after falling from such an indescribable and tremendous height as the imagination scarcely conceives , except in dreams , I alighted in a grave . ’
350066	350096	350098	350098	Ralph	208	‘ And you awoke , and found you were lying on your back , or with your head hanging over the bedside , or suffering some pain from indigestion ? ’
350100	350153	350098	350098	Ralph	208	‘ Pshaw , Mr. Bray ! Do as I do ( you will have the opportunity , now that a constant round of pleasure and enjoyment opens upon you ) , and , occupying yourself a little more by day , have no time to think of what you dream by night . ’
350182	350237	350171	350172	the bridegroom	7351	‘ Mark my words , Gride , you wo n’t have to pay HIS annuity very long . You have the devil ’s luck in bargains , always . If he is not booked to make the long voyage before many months are past and gone , I wear an orange for a head ! ’
350337	350341	350342	350342	he	208	‘ Wake up , ’
350353	350385	350342	350342	he	208	‘ and be something like life , man , will you ? They are here . Urge those dry old bones of yours this way . Quick , man , quick ! ’
350539	350549	350551	350551	Gride	548	‘ The man that came to me last night , ’
350558	350568	350551	350551	Gride	548	‘ The man that came to me last night ! ’
350569	350573	350575	350575	Ralph	208	‘ I see , ’

If the near prospect of such a husband as you have provided will not prevail upon her , I hope she may be moved by the prayers and entreaties of one of her own sex . At all events they shall be tried . I myself , avowing to her father from whom I come and by whom I am commissioned , will render it an act of greater baseness , meanness , and cruelty in him if he still dares to force this marriage on . Here I wait to see him and his daughter . For this I came and brought my sister even into your presence . Our purpose is not to see or speak with you ; therefore to you we stoop to say no more . ’

Would he like his debts paid and his house furnished , and a few bank notes for shaving paper if he shaves at all ? He ! he ! he ! ’

Nicholas swung him away , with such violence as to cause him to spin round the room until he was caught by a sharp angle of the wall , and there knocked down ; and then taking his beautiful burden in his arms rushed out . No one cared to stop him , if any were so disposed . Making his way through a mob of people , whom a report of the circumstances had attracted round the house , and carrying Madeline , in his excitement , as easily as if she were an infant , he reached the coach in which Kate and the girl were already waiting , and , confiding his charge to them , jumped up beside the coachman and bade him drive away . CHAPTER 55 Of Family Matters , Cares , Hopes , Disappointments , and Sorrows Although Mrs. Nickleby had been made acquainted by her son and daughter with every circumstance of Madeline Bray ’s history which was known to them ; although the responsible situation in which Nicholas stood had been carefully explained to her , and she had been prepared , even for the possible contingency of having to receive the young lady in her own house , improbable as such a result had appeared only a few minutes before it came about , still , Mrs. Nickleby , from the moment when this confidence was first reposed in her , late on the previous evening , had remained in an unsatisfactory and profoundly mystified state , from which no explanations or arguments could relieve her , and which every fresh soliloquy and reflection only aggravated more and more . ‘
353300	353307	352986	352986	he	7411	’ so the good lady argued ; ‘
353431	353432	353433	353433	I	0	’ ‘
353441	353447	353433	353433	I	0	’ said Kate , gently . ‘
353459	353463	353465	353466	Mrs Nickleby	207	’re very polite ! ’
353468	353490	353465	353466	Mrs Nickleby	207	‘ I have been married myself I hope , and I have seen other people married . Not understand , indeed ! ’
353491	353503	353505	353505	Kate	210	‘ I know you have had great experience , dear mama , ’
353507	353534	353505	353505	Kate	210	‘ I mean that perhaps you do n’t quite understand all the circumstances in this instance . We have stated them awkwardly , I dare say . ’
353535	353543	353545	353546	her mother	1123	‘ That I dare say you have , ’
353550	353830	353545	353546	her mother	1123	‘ That ’s very likely . I am not to be held accountable for that ; though , at the same time , as the circumstances speak for themselves , I shall take the liberty , my love , of saying that I do understand them , and perfectly well too ; whatever you and Nicholas may choose to think to the contrary . Why is such a great fuss made because this Miss Magdalen is going to marry somebody who is older than herself ? Your poor papa was older than I was , four years and a half older . Jane Dibabs -- the Dibabses lived in the beautiful little thatched white house one story high , covered all over with ivy and creeping plants , with an exquisite little porch with twining honysuckles and all sorts of things : where the earwigs used to fall into one ’s tea on a summer evening , and always fell upon their backs and kicked dreadfully , and where the frogs used to get into the rushlight shades when one stopped all night , and sit up and look through the little holes like Christians -- Jane Dibabs , SHE married a man who was a great deal older than herself , and WOULD marry him , notwithstanding all that could be said to the contrary , and she was so fond of him that nothing was ever equal to it . There was no fuss made about Jane Dibabs , and her husband was a most honourable and excellent man , and everybody spoke well of him . Then why should there by any fuss about this Magdalen ? ’
353831	353871	353873	353873	Kate	210	‘ Her husband is much older ; he is not her own choice ; his character is the very reverse of that which you have just described . Do n’t you see a broad destinction between the two cases ? ’
354293	354297	354277	354277	she	207	‘ as good as ’
354323	354327	354306	354307	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ as good as ’
354859	354863	354864	354865	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ My dear , ’
354900	354914	354864	354865	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ how do you find yourself tonight ? I hope you are better . ’
354915	354921	354922	354922	Kate	210	‘ Almost well , mama , ’
354939	354942	354943	354944	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ Kate ! ’
354950	354956	354943	354944	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ do n’t talk so loud ’
355012	355058	355004	355004	she	207	‘ My son Nicholas has just come home , and I have come , according to custom , my dear , to know , from your own lips , exactly how you are ; for he wo n’t take my account , and never will . ’
355059	355069	355004	355004	she	207	‘ He is later than usual to - night , ’
355075	355081	355071	355071	Madeline	542	‘ Nearly half an hour . ’
355082	355104	355105	355106	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ Well , I never saw such people in all my life as you are , for time , up here ! ’
355113	355249	355105	355106	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ I declare I never did ! I had not the least idea that Nicholas was after his time , not the smallest . Mr. Nickleby used to say -- your poor papa , I am speaking of , Kate my dear -- used to say , that appetite was the best clock in the world , but you have no appetite , my dear Miss Bray , I wish you had , and upon my word I really think you ought to take something that would give you one . I am sure I do n’t know , but I have heard that two or three dozen native lobsters give an appetite , though that comes to the same thing after all , for I suppose you must have an appetite before you can take ‘
355279	355280	355281	355281	We	7446	’ ‘
355296	355297	355290	355290	mama	9827	’ ‘
355530	356328	355526	355526	I	0	’ With that , Mrs. Nickleby would draw up a chair , and for some three - quarters of an hour run through a great variety of distracting topics in the most distracting manner possible ; tearing herself away , at length , on the plea that she must now go and amuse Nicholas while he took his supper . After a preliminary raising of his spirits with the information that she considered the patient decidedly worse , she would further cheer him up by relating how dull , listless , and low - spirited Miss Bray was , because Kate foolishly talked about nothing else but him and family matters . When she had made Nicholas thoroughly comfortable with these and other inspiriting remarks , she would discourse at length on the arduous duties she had performed that day ; and , sometimes , be moved to tears in wondering how , if anything were to happen to herself , the family would ever get on without her . At other times , when Nicholas came home at night , he would be accompanied by Mr. Frank Cheeryble , who was commissioned by the brothers to inquire how Madeline was that evening . On such occasions ( and they were of very frequent occurrence ) , Mrs. Nickleby deemed it of particular importance that she should have her wits about her ; for , from certain signs and tokens which had attracted her attention , she shrewdly suspected that Mr. Frank , interested as his uncles were in Madeline , came quite as much to see Kate as to inquire after her ; the more especially as the brothers were in constant communication with the medical man , came backwards and forwards very frequently themselves , and received a full report from Nicholas every morning . These were proud times for Mrs Nickleby ; never was anybody half so discreet and sage as she , or half so mysterious withal ; and never were there such cunning generalship , and such unfathomable designs , as she brought to bear upon Mr. Frank , with the view of ascertaining whether her suspicions were well founded : and if so , of tantalising him into taking her into his confidence and throwing himself upon her merciful consideration . Extensive was the artillery , heavy and light , which Mrs. Nickleby brought into play for the furtherance of these great schemes ; various and opposite the means which she employed to bring about the end she had in view . At one time , she was all cordiality and ease ; at another , all stiffness and frigidity . Now , she would seem to open her whole heart to her unhappy victim ; the next time they met , she would receive him with the most distant and studious reserve , as if a new light had broken in upon her , and , guessing his intentions , she had resolved to check them in the bud ; as if she felt it her bounden duty to act with Spartan firmness , and at once and for ever to discourage hopes which never could be realised . At other times , when Nicholas was not there to overhear , and Kate was upstairs busily tending her sick friend , the worthy lady would throw out dark hints of an intention to send her daughter to France for three or four years , or to Scotland for the improvement of her health impaired by her late fatigues , or to America on a visit , or anywhere that threatened a long and tedious separation . Nay , she even went so far as to hint , obscurely , at an attachment entertained for her daughter by the son of an old neighbour of theirs , one Horatio Peltirogus ( a young gentleman who might have been , at that time , four years old , or thereabouts ) , and to represent it , indeed , as almost a settled thing between the families -- only waiting for her daughter ’s final decision , to come off with the sanction of the church , and to the unspeakable happiness and content of all parties . It was in the full pride and glory of having sprung this last mine one night with extraordinary success , that Mrs. Nickleby took the opportunity of being left alone with her son before retiring to rest , to sound him on the subject which so occupied her thoughts : not doubting that they could have but one opinion respecting it . To this end , she approached the question with divers laudatory and appropriate remarks touching the general amiability of Mr. Frank Cheeryble . ‘
356336	356340	356329	356329	You	7453	’ said Nicholas , ‘
356350	356351	356344	356344	He	7455	’ ‘
356358	356363	356344	356344	He	7455	’ said Mrs. Nickleby . ‘
356369	356373	356344	356344	He	7455	’ answered Nicholas . ‘
356386	356402	356376	356376	you	7453	’ pursued Mrs. Nickleby , wishing to interest Nicholas in the subject to the utmost . ‘
356406	356410	356376	356376	you	7453	’ repeated Nicholas . ‘
356413	356418	356376	356376	you	7453	’ returned his mother , ‘

356550	356584	356547	356547	I	0	’ Nicholas returned to the perusal of the book he had been reading , when the dialogue had gone thus far . Mrs. Nickleby , after stopping a little for consideration , resumed . ‘
356598	356632	356633	356633	Hem	233	’ Nicholas laughingly said , as he closed his book , that he was glad to hear it , and observed that his mother seemed deep in their new friend ’s confidence already . ‘
356635	356640	356633	356633	Hem	233	’ said Mrs. Nickleby . ‘
356669	356701	356702	356702	I	0	’ Elated by a look of curiosity from her son , and the consciousness of possessing a great secret , all to herself , Mrs. Nickleby went on with great animation : ‘
356855	356886	356887	356887	I	0	’ Nicholas snuffed the candles , put his hands in his pockets , and , leaning back in his chair , assumed a look of patient suffering and melancholy resignation . ‘

357254	357327	357359	357359	her	7480	’re coming , it ’s always better ; because , of course , though it ’s not only natural but perfectly correct and proper under the circumstances , still it is very confusing if you interrupt young people when they are -- when they are sitting on the sofa , and -- and all that sort of thing : which is very nonsensical , perhaps , but still they will do it . ’
357431	357435	357437	357437	Nicholas	207	‘ With whom ? ’
357446	357455	357439	357440	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ What ! OUR Kate ! My sister ! ’

357466	357501	357463	357464	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ whose Kate should it be , if not ours ; or what should I care about it , or take any interest in it for , if it was anybody but your sister ? ’
357502	357506	357508	357508	Nicholas	207	‘ Dear mother , ’
357510	357517	357508	357508	Nicholas	207	‘ surely it ca n’t be ! ’
357518	357525	357527	357528	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ Very good , my dear , ’
357534	357539	357527	357528	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ Wait and see . ’
357726	357738	357740	357740	Nicholas	207	‘ I am very much disturbed by what you tell me , ’

357758	357769	357771	357772	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ I do n’t understand why you should hope so , ’
357774	357788	357771	357772	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ I confess ; but you may depend upon it I am not . ’

357810	357895	357896	357896	She	207	‘ is just the point upon which I am not yet satisfied . During this sickness , she has been constantly at Madeline ’s bedside -- never were two people so fond of each other as they have grown -- and to tell you the truth , Nicholas , I have rather kept her away now and then , because I think it ’s a good plan , and urges a young man on . He does n’t get too sure , you know . ’
357945	357949	357950	357950	he	7487	‘ Dear mother , ’
357954	358045	357950	357950	he	7487	‘ do n’t you see that if there were really any serious inclination on the part of Mr. Frank towards Kate , and we suffered ourselves for a moment to encourage it , we should be acting a most dishonourable and ungrateful part ? I ask you if you do n’t see it , but I need not say that I know you do n’t , or you would have been more strictly on your guard . Let me explain my meaning to you . Remember how poor we are . ’
358066	358069	358071	358071	Nicholas	207	‘ No , ’
358073	358345	358071	358071	Nicholas	207	‘ and for that reason poverty should engender an honest pride , that it may not lead and tempt us to unworthy actions , and that we may preserve the self - respect which a hewer of wood and drawer of water may maintain , and does better in maintaining than a monarch in preserving his . Think what we owe to these two brothers : remember what they have done , and what they do every day for us with a generosity and delicacy for which the devotion of our whole lives would be a most imperfect and inadequate return . What kind of return would that be which would be comprised in our permitting their nephew , their only relative , whom they regard as a son , and for whom it would be mere childishness to suppose they have not formed plans suitably adapted to the education he has had , and the fortune he will inherit -- in our permitting him to marry a portionless girl : so closely connected with us , that the irresistible inference must be , that he was entrapped by a plot ; that it was a deliberate scheme , and a speculation amongst us three ? Bring the matter clearly before yourself , mother . Now , how would you feel , if they were married , and the brothers , coming here on one of those kind errands which bring them here so often , you had to break out to them the truth ? Would you be at ease , and feel that you had played an open part ? ’
358370	358388	358390	358390	Nicholas	207	‘ Why , to be sure , that would place HIM in a better situation with them , ’
358392	358438	358439	358439	he	481	‘ but we should still be open to the same suspicions ; the distance between us would still be as great ; the advantages to be gained would still be as manifest as now . We may be reckoning without our host in all this , ’
358444	358497	358439	358439	he	481	‘ and I trust , and almost believe we are . If it be otherwise , I have that confidence in Kate that I know she will feel as I do -- and in you , dear mother , to be assured that after a little consideration you will do the same . ’
358800	359026	358790	358790	Charles	489	‘ My dear sir , no time must be lost . This lad shall not die , if such human means as we can use can save his life ; neither shall he die alone , and in a strange place . Remove him tomorrow morning , see that he has every comfort that his situation requires , and do n’t leave him ; do n’t leave him , my dear sir , until you know that there is no longer any immediate danger . It would be hard , indeed , to part you now . No , no , no ! Tim shall wait upon you tonight , sir ; Tim shall wait upon you tonight with a parting word or two . Brother Ned , my dear fellow , Mr. Nickleby waits to shake hands and say goodbye ; Mr. Nickleby wo n’t be long gone ; this poor chap will soon get better , very soon get better ; and then he ’ll find out some nice homely country - people to leave him with , and will go backwards and forwards sometimes -- backwards and forwards you know , Ned . And there ’s no cause to be downhearted , for he ’ll very soon get better , very soon . Wo n’t he , wo n’t he , Ned ? ’

How many anxious years , how many pinching days and sleepless nights , before I scraped together that ten thousand pounds!--Ten thousand pounds ! How many proud painted dames would have fawned and smiled , and how many spendthrift blockheads done me lip - service to my face and cursed me in their hearts , while I turned that ten thousand pounds into twenty ! While I ground , and pinched , and used these needy borrowers for my pleasure and profit , what smooth - tongued speeches , and courteous looks , and civil letters , they would have given me ! The ca nt of the lying world is , that men like me compass our riches by dissimulation and treachery : by fawning , cringing , and stooping . Why , how many lies , what mean and abject evasions , what humbled behaviour from upstarts who , but for my money , would spurn me aside as they do their betters every day , would that ten thousand pounds have brought me in ! Grant that I had doubled it -- made cent . per cent.--for every sovereign told another -- there would not be one piece of money in all the heap which would n’t represent ten thousand mean and paltry lies , told , not by the money - lender , oh no ! but by the money - borrowers , your liberal , thoughtless , generous , dashing folks , who would n’t be so mean as save a sixpence for the world ! ’

For births , deaths , marriages , and all the events which are of interest to most men , have ( unless they are connected with gain or loss of money ) no interest for me . But now , I swear , I mix up with the loss , his triumph in telling it . If he had brought it about,--I almost feel as if he had,--I could n’t hate him more . Let me but retaliate upon him , by degrees , however slow -- let me but begin to get the better of him , let me but turn the scale -- and I can bear it . ’
362639	362645	362646	362646	he	7562	‘ Well , Mr. Squeers , ’

A wisitation , sir , is the lot of mortality . Mortality itself , sir , is a wisitation . The world is chock full of wisitations ; and if a boy repines at a wisitation and makes you uncomfortable with his noise , he must have his head punched . That ’s going according to the Scripter , that is . ’

363051	363060	363062	363062	Ralph	208	‘ I have reason to suspect that fellow , ’
363072	363101	363062	363062	Ralph	208	‘ Therefore , until I have thought of the shortest and least troublesome way of ruining him , I hold it best to keep him at a distance . ’
363102	363116	363118	363118	Squeers	203	‘ It would n’t take much to ruin him , I should think , ’

363132	363150	363130	363130	Ralph	208	‘ Nor to ruin a great many people whom I know . You were going to say-- ? ’
363208	363289	363190	363191	Mr. Squeers	203	‘ Why , what I was a - going to say , sir , is , that this here business regarding of that ungrateful and hard - hearted chap , Snawley senior , puts me out of my way , and occasions a inconveniency quite unparalleled , besides , as I may say , making , for whole weeks together , Mrs. Squeers a perfect widder . It ’s a pleasure to me to act with you , of course . ’
363290	363294	363296	363296	Ralph	208	‘ Of course , ’
363300	363308	363310	363311	Mr. Squeers	203	‘ Yes , I say of course , ’
363317	363360	363310	363311	Mr. Squeers	203	‘ but at the same time , when one comes , as I do now , better than two hundred and fifty mile to take a afferdavid , it does put a man out a good deal , letting alone the risk . ’
363361	363372	363374	363374	Ralph	208	‘ And where may the risk be , Mr. Squeers ? ’
363376	363385	363387	363387	Squeers	231	‘ I said , letting alone the risk , ’
363391	363401	363387	363387	Squeers	231	‘ And I said , where was the risk ? ’
363402	363414	363416	363416	Squeers	231	‘ I was n’t complaining , you know , Mr. Nickleby , ’
363418	363427	363416	363416	Squeers	231	‘ Upon my word I never see such a-- ’
363428	363437	363439	363439	Ralph	208	‘ I ask you where is the risk ? ’
363443	363448	363450	363450	Squeers	231	‘ Where the risk ? ’
363458	363482	363387	363387	Squeers	231	‘ Why , it an’t necessary to mention . Certain subjects is best awoided . Oh , you know what risk I mean . ’
363483	363491	363493	363493	Ralph	208	‘ How often have I told you , ’
363495	363590	363493	363493	Ralph	208	‘ and how often am I to tell you , that you run no risk ? What have you sworn , or what are you asked to swear , but that at such and such a time a boy was left with you in the name of Smike ; that he was at your school for a given number of years , was lost under such and such circumstances , is now found , and has been identified by you in such and such keeping ? This is all true ; is it not ? ’
363591	363594	363596	363596	Squeers	231	‘ Yes , ’
363598	363604	363596	363596	Squeers	231	‘ that ’s all true . ’
363605	363610	363612	363612	Ralph	208	‘ Well , then , ’
363614	363642	363612	363612	Ralph	208	‘ what risk do you run ? Who swears to a lie but Snawley ; a man whom I have paid much less than I have you ? ’
363643	363653	363655	363655	Squeers	231	‘ He certainly did it cheap , did Snawley , ’
363657	363663	363665	363665	Ralph	208	‘ He did it cheap ! ’
363669	363785	363665	363665	Ralph	208	‘ yes , and he did it well , and carries it off with a hypocritical face and a sanctified air , but you ! Risk ! What do you mean by risk ? The certificates are all genuine , Snawley HAD another son , he HAS been married twice , his first wife IS dead , none but her ghost could tell that she did n’t write that letter , none but Snawley himself can tell that this is not his son , and that his son is food for worms ! The only perjury is Snawley ’s , and I fancy he is pretty well used to it . Where ’s your risk ? ’
363786	363792	363794	363794	Squeers	231	‘ Why , you know , ’
363801	363815	363794	363794	Squeers	231	‘ if you come to that , I might say where ’s yours ? ’
363816	363824	363826	363826	Ralph	208	‘ You might say where ’s mine ! ’
363828	363885	363826	363826	Ralph	208	‘ you may say where ’s mine . I do n’t appear in the business , neither do you . All Snawley ’s interest is to stick well to the story he has told ; and all his risk is , to depart from it in the least . Talk of YOUR risk in the conspiracy ! ’
363886	363890	363892	363892	Squeers	231	‘ I say , ’
363898	363913	363892	363892	Squeers	231	‘ do n’t call it that ! Just as a favour , do n’t . ’
363914	363921	363923	363923	Ralph	208	‘ Call it what you like , ’
363927	364023	363923	363923	Ralph	208	‘ but attend to me . This tale was originally fabricated as a means of annoyance against one who hurt your trade and half cudgelled you to death , and to enable you to obtain repossession of a half - dead drudge , whom you wished to regain , because , while you wreaked your vengeance on him for his share in the business , you knew that the knowledge that he was again in your power would be the best punishment you could inflict upon your enemy . Is that so , Mr. Squeers ? ’
364024	364029	364031	364031	Squeers	231	‘ Why , sir , ’
364055	364062	364050	364050	his	208	‘ in a measure it was . ’
364063	364069	364071	364071	Ralph	208	‘ What does that mean ? ’
364073	364081	364071	364071	Ralph	208	‘ Why , in a measure means , ’
364085	364111	364071	364071	Ralph	208	‘ as it may be , that it was n’t all on my account , because you had some old grudge to satisfy , too . ’
364112	364119	364121	364121	Ralph	208	‘ If I had not had , ’
364131	364141	364121	364121	Ralph	208	‘ do you think I should have helped you ? ’
364142	364153	364154	364154	Squeers	231	‘ Why no , I do n’t suppose you would , ’
364157	364172	364154	364154	Squeers	231	‘ I only wanted that point to be all square and straight between us . ’
364173	364181	364183	364183	Ralph	208	‘ How can it ever be otherwise ? ’
364185	364295	364183	364183	Ralph	208	‘ Except that the account is against me , for I spend money to gratify my hatred , and you pocket it , and gratify yours at the same time . You are , at least , as avaricious as you are revengeful . So am I. Which is best off ? You , who win money and revenge , at the same time and by the same process , and who are , at all events , sure of money , if not of revenge ; or I , who am only sure of spending money in any case , and can but win bare revenge at last ? ’
364576	364579	364581	364581	Ralph	208	‘ Now , ’

No advantage can be reaped from this deed , whatever it is , save by the girl herself , or her husband ; and the possession of this deed by one or other of them is indispensable to any advantage being gained . THAT I have discovered beyond the possibility of doubt . I want that deed brought here , that I may give the man who brings it fifty pounds in gold , and burn it to ashes before his face . ’
364747	364757	364730	364730	he	203	‘ Yes ; but who ’s to bring it ? ’
364758	364776	364778	364778	Ralph	208	‘ Nobody , perhaps , for much is to be done before it can be got at , ’
364780	364787	364778	364778	Ralph	208	‘ But if anybody -- you ! ’

365376	365385	365387	365387	he	203	‘ whether he could n’t go another fifty , ’
365415	365426	365427	365427	he	203	‘ But how are you to get at the woman ? ’
365430	365440	365427	365427	he	203	‘ that ’s what it is as puzzles me . ’
365441	365451	365453	365453	Ralph	208	‘ I may not get at her at all , ’
365455	365546	365453	365453	Ralph	208	‘ but I ’ll try . I have hunted people in this city , before now , who have been better hid than she ; and I know quarters in which a guinea or two , carefully spent , will often solve darker riddles than this . Ay , and keep them close too , if need be ! I hear my man ringing at the door . We may as well part . You had better not come to and fro , but wait till you hear from me . ’
365547	365550	365552	365552	Squeers	231	‘ Good ! ’
365554	365581	365552	365552	Squeers	231	‘ I say ! If you should n’t find her out , you ’ll pay expenses at the Saracen , and something for loss of time ? ’
365582	365585	365587	365587	Ralph	208	‘ Well , ’
365591	365601	365587	365587	Ralph	208	‘ yes ! You have nothing more to say ? ’
365648	365651	365652	365652	he	211	‘ Now ! ’
365655	365735	365652	365652	he	211	‘ come what come may , for the present I am firm and unshaken . Let me but retrieve this one small portion of my loss and disgrace ; let me but defeat him in this one hope , dear to his heart as I know it must be ; let me but do this ; and it shall be the first link in such a chain which I will wind about him , as never man forged yet . ’
366296	366394	366257	366257	he	203	‘ Well , this is a pretty go , is this here ! An uncommon pretty go ! Here have I been , a matter of how many weeks -- hard upon six -- a follering up this here blessed old dowager petty larcenerer,’--Mr . Squeers delivered himself of this epithet with great difficulty and effort,--‘and Dotheboys Hall a - running itself regularly to seed the while ! That ’s the worst of ever being in with a owdacious chap like that old Nickleby . You never know when he ’s done with you , and if you ’re
366401	366407	366400	366400	you	7620	’re in for a pound . ’
366455	366460	366433	366433	he	203	‘ I never see , ’
366467	366587	366462	366463	Mr. Squeers	203	‘ I never see nor come across such a file as that old Nickleby . Never ! He ’s out of everybody ’s depth , he is . He ’s what you may call a rasper , is Nickleby . To see how sly and cunning he grubbed on , day after day , a - worming and plodding and tracing and turning and twining of hisself about , till he found out where this precious Mrs. Peg was hid , and cleared the ground for me to work upon . Creeping and crawling and gliding , like a ugly , old , bright - eyed , stagnation - blooded adder ! Ah ! He ’d have made a good ‘
366647	366714	366634	366634	I	0	’ Making a halt in his reflections at this place , Mr. Squeers again put his glass to his lips , and drawing a dirty letter from his pocket , proceeded to con over its contents with the air of a man who had read it very often , and now refreshed his memory rather in the absence of better amusement than for any specific information . ‘
366720	366725	366634	366634	I	0	’ said Mr. Squeers , ‘
366964	367006	366930	366930	He	7628	’ Mr. Squeers was so much moved by the contemplation of this hardened nature in one so young , that he angrily put up the letter , and sought , in a new train of ideas , a subject of consolation . ‘
367021	367025	366930	366930	He	7628	’ he said ; ‘
367099	367199	367230	367231	Mrs. Squeers	231	’ money comes in just the same as if I was at home , and Mrs. Squeers she keeps them in order . There ’ll be some lost time to make up , of course . There ’ll be an arrear of flogging as’ll have to be gone through : still , a couple of days makes that all right , and one do n’t mind a little extra work for one hundred pound . It ’s pretty nigh the time to wait upon the old woman . From what she said last night , I suspect that if I ’m
367239	367396	367230	367231	Mrs. Squeers	231	’ Leering with his one eye as if the lady to whom he drank had been actually present , Mr. Squeers -- in his enthusiasm , no doubt -- poured out a full glass , and emptied it ; and as the liquor was raw spirits , and he had applied himself to the same bottle more than once already , it is not surprising that he found himself , by this time , in an extremely cheerful state , and quite enough excited for his purpose . What this purpose was soon appeared ; for , after a few turns about the room to steady himself , he took the bottle under his arm and the glass in his hand , and blowing out the candle as if he purposed being gone some time , stole out upon the staircase , and creeping softly to a door opposite his own , tapped gently at it . ‘
367405	367409	367410	367410	She	7636	’ he said , ‘
367440	367519	367437	367437	I	0	’ With this brief preface , Mr. Squeers applied his hand to the latch of the door , and thrusting his head into a garret far more deplorable than that he had just left , and seeing that there was nobody there but an old woman , who was bending over a wretched fire ( for although the weather was still warm , the evening was chilly ) , walked in , and tapped her on the shoulder . ‘
367525	367532	367535	367535	you	7638	’ said Mr. Squeers , jocularly . ‘
367537	367541	367535	367535	you	7638	’ inquired Peg . ‘
367606	367618	367571	367571	Squeers	231	’ replied Mr. Squeers , quoting at random from the grammar . ‘
367645	367700	367639	367639	I	0	’ Delivering this reply in his accustomed tone of voice , in which of course it was inaudible to Peg , Mr. Squeers drew a stool to the fire , and placing himself over against her , and the bottle and glass on the floor between them , roared out again , very loud , ‘
367706	367707	367710	367710	you	231	’ ‘
367712	367721	367710	367710	you	231	’ said Peg , receiving him very graciously . ‘
367729	367733	367735	367735	they	7641	’ roared Squeers . ‘
367749	367755	367735	367735	they	7641	’ observed Peg , complacently , ‘

367769	367782	367735	367735	they	7641	’ roared Squeers , adding some rather strong language in an undertone . ‘

367806	367845	367847	367847	you	0	’ muttered Squeers , looking as amiable as he possibly could the while ; for Peg ’s eye was upon him , and she was chuckling fearfully , as though in delight at having made a choice repartee , ‘

367862	367866	367858	367858	I	0	’ answered Peg . ‘
367875	367879	367871	367871	you	0	’ bawled Squeers . ‘
367885	367891	367871	367871	you	0	’ Peg saw that too . ‘
367897	367908	367909	367909	I	0	’ said Squeers , accompanying his remarks with appropriate action , ‘
367943	367972	367942	367942	I	0	’m forced to throw into the fire -- hallo ! we shall have the chimbley alight next -- fill it again , and hand it over to you . ’
367973	367977	367979	367979	Peg	576	‘ YOUR health , ’
367981	367988	367990	367990	Squeers	231	‘ She understands that , anyways , ’
368014	368029	368030	368031	Mrs. Sliderskew	577	‘ Now then , let ’s have a talk . How ’s the rheumatics ? ’
368066	368072	368074	368075	Mr. Squeers	203	‘ What ’s the reason , ’
368084	368105	368074	368075	Mr. Squeers	203	‘ what ’s the reason of rheumatics ? What do they mean ? What do people have’em for -- eh ? ’
368125	368141	368143	368144	Mr. Squeers	203	‘ Measles , rheumatics , hooping - cough , fevers , agers , and lumbagers , ’
368146	368324	368143	368144	Mr. Squeers	203	‘ is all philosophy together ; that ’s what it is . The heavenly bodies is philosophy , and the earthly bodies is philosophy . If there ’s a screw loose in a heavenly body , that ’s philosophy ; and if there ’s screw loose in a earthly body , that ’s philosophy too ; or it may be that sometimes there ’s a little metaphysics in it , but that ’s not often . Philosophy ’s the chap for me . If a parent asks a question in the classical , commercial , or mathematical line , says I , gravely , “ Why , sir , in the first place , are you a philosopher?”--“No , Mr. Squeers , ” he says , “ I an’t . ” “ Then , sir , ” says I , “ I am sorry for you , for I sha n’t be able to explain it . ” Naturally , the parent goes away and wishes he was a philosopher , and , equally naturally , thinks I ’m
368327	368384	368143	368144	Mr. Squeers	203	’ Saying this , and a great deal more , with tipsy profundity and a serio - comic air , and keeping his eye all the time on Mrs. Sliderskew , who was unable to hear one word , Mr. Squeers concluded by helping himself and passing the bottle : to which Peg did becoming reverence . ‘
368392	368397	368398	368398	You	7646	’ said Mr. Squeers . ‘
368408	368424	368398	368398	You	7646	’ Again Mrs. Sliderskew chuckled , but modesty forbade her assenting verbally to the compliment . ‘
368430	368435	368437	368437	you	7646	’ repeated Mr. Squeers , ‘

369042	369049	369051	369051	Squeers	231	‘ More than even , Slider , ’

369152	369163	369141	369141	Slider	597	’ said Peg , with several knowing looks and winks . ‘

369555	369671	369536	369537	my Slider	7637	’ Peg trotted to the door , and after fumbling at the bolt , crept to the other end of the room , and from beneath the coals which filled the bottom of the cupboard , drew forth a small deal box . Having placed this on the floor at Squeers ’s feet , she brought , from under the pillow of her bed , a small key , with which she signed to that gentleman to open it . Mr. Squeers , who had eagerly followed her every motion , lost no time in obeying this hint : and , throwing back the lid , gazed with rapture on the documents which lay within . ‘

370182	370707	370152	370152	you	597	’ And taking the candle down beside him , Mr. Squeers , with great eagerness and a cunning grin overspreading his face , entered upon his task of examination . If the old woman had not been very deaf , she must have heard , when she last went to the door , the breathing of two persons close behind it : and if those two persons had been unacquainted with her infirmity , they must probably have chosen that moment either for presenting themselves or taking to flight . But , knowing with whom they had to deal , they remained quite still , and now , not only appeared unobserved at the door -- which was not bolted , for the bolt had no hasp -- but warily , and with noiseless footsteps , advanced into the room . As they stole farther and farther in by slight and scarcely perceptible degrees , and with such caution that they scarcely seemed to breathe , the old hag and Squeers little dreaming of any such invasion , and utterly unconscious of there being any soul near but themselves , were busily occupied with their tasks . The old woman , with her wrinkled face close to the bars of the stove , puffing at the dull embers which had not yet caught the wood ; Squeers stooping down to the candle , which brought out the full ugliness of his face , as the light of the fire did that of his companion ; both intently engaged , and wearing faces of exultation which contrasted strongly with the anxious looks of those behind , who took advantage of the slightest sound to cover their advance , and , almost before they had moved an inch , and all was silent , stopped again . This , with the large bare room , damp walls , and flickering doubtful light , combined to form a scene which the most careless and indifferent spectator ( could any have been present ) could scarcely have failed to derive some interest from , and would not readily have forgotten . Of the stealthy comers , Frank Cheeryble was one , and Newman Noggs the other . Newman had caught up , by the rusty nozzle , an old pair of bellows , which were just undergoing a flourish in the air preparatory to a descent upon the head of Mr. Squeers , when Frank , with an earnest gesture , stayed his arm , and , taking another step in advance , came so close behind the schoolmaster that , by leaning slightly forward , he could plainly distinguish the writing which he held up to his eye . Mr. Squeers , not being remarkably erudite , appeared to be considerably puzzled by this first prize , which was in an engrossing hand , and not very legible except to a practised eye . Having tried it by reading from left to right , and from right to left , and finding it equally clear both ways , he turned it upside down with no better success . ‘
370714	370743	370152	370152	you	597	’ chuckled Peg , who , on her knees before the fire , was feeding it with fragments of the box , and grinning in most devilish exultation . ‘
370752	370753	370152	370152	you	597	’ ‘
370757	370766	370152	370152	you	597	’ replied Squeers , tossing it towards her . ‘
370788	370801	370152	370152	you	597	’ Mrs. Sliderskew complied , and inquired what the next one was . ‘
370804	370808	370152	370152	you	597	’ said Squeers , ‘
370827	370846	370847	370847	Peg	576	’re all MPs , so it ’s of no use to anybody . Throw it in the fire ! ’
370860	370863	370865	370865	Squeers	231	‘ This , ’
370867	370915	370865	370865	Squeers	231	‘ seems to be some deed of sale of the right of presentation to the rectory of Purechurch , in the valley of Cashup . Take care of that , Slider , literally for God ’s sake . It ’ll fetch its price at the Auction Mart . ’
370916	370922	370924	370924	Peg	576	‘ What ’s the next ? ’
370926	370931	370933	370933	Squeers	231	‘ Why , this , ’
370935	371046	370933	370933	Squeers	231	‘ seems , from the two letters that ’s with it , to be a bond from a curate down in the country , to pay half a year ’s wages of forty pound for borrowing twenty . Take care of that , for if he do n’t pay it , his bishop will very soon be down upon him . We know what the camel and the needle ’s eye means ; no man as ca n’t live upon his income , whatever it is , must expect to go to heaven at any price . It ’s very odd ; I do n’t see anything like it yet . ’
371047	371053	371055	371055	Peg	576	‘ What ’s the matter ? ’
371057	371060	371062	371062	Squeers	231	‘ Nothing , ’
371064	371067	371062	371062	Squeers	231	‘ only I ’m
371070	371101	371103	371103	you	7671	’ Newman raised the bellows again . Once more , Frank , by a rapid motion of his arm , unaccompanied by any noise , checked him in his purpose . ‘
371106	371110	371103	371103	you	7671	’ said Squeers , ‘
371161	371214	371215	371215	I	0	’ Eagerly throwing towards the old woman a parchment that he caught up for the purpose , Squeers , as she turned her head , thrust into the breast of his large coat , the deed in which these words had caught his eye , and burst into a shout of triumph . ‘
371220	371224	371215	371215	I	0	’ said Squeers . ‘
371254	371328	371215	371215	I	0	’ Peg demanded what he laughed at , but no answer was returned . Newman ’s arm could no longer be restrained ; the bellows , descending heavily and with unerring aim on the very centre of Mr. Squeers ’s head , felled him to the floor , and stretched him on it flat and senseless . CHAPTER 58 In which one Scene of this History is closed Dividing the distance into two days ’
372066	372070	372072	372072	Nicholas	207	‘ Even here , ’
372075	372195	372072	372072	Nicholas	207	‘ we used to loiter before we knew what death was , and when we little thought whose ashes would rest beneath ; and , wondering at the silence , sit down to rest and speak below our breath . Once , Kate was lost , and after an hour of fruitless search , they found her , fast asleep , under that tree which shades my father ’s grave . He was very fond of her , and said when he took her up in his arms , still sleeping , that whenever he died he would wish to be buried where his dear little child had laid her head . You see his wish was not forgotten . ’
372251	372256	372258	372258	Nicholas	207	‘ What is that ? ’
372262	372280	372258	372258	Nicholas	207	‘ If I can redeem it , or hope to do so , you know I will . ’

372293	372323	372324	372324	Nicholas	207	‘ Promise me that when I die , I shall be buried near -- as near as they can make my grave -- to the tree we saw today . ’

372736	372745	372730	372730	Nicholas	207	‘ Be calm ; you have been dreaming . ’
372746	372753	372755	372755	Smike	264	‘ No , no , no ! ’
372761	372780	372755	372755	Smike	264	‘ Hold me tight . Do n’t let me go . There , there . Behind the tree ! ’
372810	372818	372819	372819	he	5599	‘ This is nothing but your fancy , ’
372829	372835	372819	372819	he	5599	‘ nothing else , indeed . ’

372877	372884	372886	372886	Nicholas	207	‘ Do I ever leave you ? ’
372888	372898	372886	372886	Nicholas	207	‘ Lie down again -- there ! You see I ’m

372916	372930	372913	372913	you	207	’ said Smike , in a low voice , and glancing fearfully round , ‘
372948	372949	372934	372934	my	0	’ ‘
372954	372955	372956	372956	I	0	’ ‘
372988	372989	372985	372985	he	7708	’ ‘
372996	373000	372985	372985	he	7708	’ said Nicholas ; ‘
373048	373049	373044	373045	that man	2599	’ ‘
373056	373060	373066	373066	he	7708	’ returned Smike ; ‘
373204	373664	373199	373199	he	7708	’ Nicholas endeavoured , by every persuasion and argument he could think of , to convince the terrified creature that his imagination had deceived him , and that this close resemblance between the creation of his dreams and the man he supposed he had seen was but a proof of it ; but all in vain . When he could persuade him to remain , for a few moments , in the care of the people to whom the house belonged , he instituted a strict inquiry whether any stranger had been seen , and searched himself behind the tree , and through the orchard , and upon the land immediately adjoining , and in every place near , where it was possible for a man to lie concealed ; but all in vain . Satisfied that he was right in his original conjecture , he applied himself to calming the fears of Smike , which , after some time , he partially succeeded in doing , though not in removing the impression upon his mind ; for he still declared , again and again , in the most solemn and fervid manner , that he had positively seen what he had described , and that nothing could ever remove his conviction of its reality . And now , Nicholas began to see that hope was gone , and that , upon the partner of his poverty , and the sharer of his better fortune , the world was closing fast . There was little pain , little uneasiness , but there was no rallying , no effort , no struggle for life . He was worn and wasted to the last degree ; his voice had sunk so low , that he could scarce be heard to speak . Nature was thoroughly exhausted , and he had lain him down to die . On a fine , mild autumn day , when all was tranquil and at peace : when the soft sweet air crept in at the open window of the quiet room , and not a sound was heard but the gentle rustling of the leaves : Nicholas sat in his old place by the bedside , and knew that the time was nearly come . So very still it was , that , every now and then , he bent down his ear to listen for the breathing of him who lay asleep , as if to assure himself that life was still there , and that he had not fallen into that deep slumber from which on earth there is no waking . While he was thus employed , the closed eyes opened , and on the pale face there came a placid smile . ‘
373669	373673	373199	373199	he	7708	’ said Nicholas . ‘
373681	373682	373199	373199	he	7708	’ ‘
373690	373695	373683	373683	I	0	’ was the answer . ‘
373702	373703	373683	373683	I	0	’ ‘
373707	373730	373683	373683	I	0	’ said Nicholas . The dying boy turned towards him , and , putting his arm about his neck , made answer , ‘
373737	373747	373748	373748	I	0	’ After a short silence , he spoke again . ‘
373755	373759	373748	373748	I	0	’ he said . ‘
373825	373876	373877	373877	You	7718	’ The trembling voice and tearful eye , and the closer grasp of the arm which accompanied these latter words , showed how they filled the speaker ’s heart ; nor were there wanting indications of how deeply they had touched the heart of him to whom they were addressed . ‘
373881	373887	373877	373877	You	7718	’ returned Nicholas at length , ‘
373910	373911	373912	373912	I	0	’ ‘
373944	373945	373946	373946	I	0	’ ‘
373950	373954	373958	373958	you	0	’ exclaimed Nicholas . ‘

373993	373997	373980	373980	I	0	’ said Nicholas . ‘

374025	374034	374017	374017	I	0	’ He drew his friend closer to him . ‘
374083	374263	374081	374081	I	0	’ The words which followed were feebly and faintly uttered , and broken by long pauses ; but , from them , Nicholas learnt , for the first time , that the dying boy , with all the ardour of a nature concentrated on one absorbing , hopeless , secret passion , loved his sister Kate . He had procured a lock of her hair , which hung at his breast , folded in one or two slight ribbons she had worn . He prayed that , when he was dead , Nicholas would take it off , so that no eyes but his might see it , and that when he was laid in his coffin and about to be placed in the earth , he would hang it round his neck again , that it might rest with him in the grave . Upon his knees Nicholas gave him this pledge , and promised again that he should rest in the spot he had pointed out . They embraced , and kissed each other on the cheek . ‘
374266	374270	374081	374081	I	0	’ he murmured , ‘
374275	374596	374081	374081	I	0	’ He fell into a light slumber , and waking smiled as before ; then , spoke of beautiful gardens , which he said stretched out before him , and were filled with figures of men , women , and many children , all with light upon their faces ; then , whispered that it was Eden -- and so died . CHAPTER 59 The Plots begin to fail , and Doubts and Dangers to disturb the Plotter Ralph sat alone , in the solitary room where he was accustomed to take his meals , and to sit of nights when no profitable occupation called him abroad . Before him was an untasted breakfast , and near to where his fingers beat restlessly upon the table , lay his watch . It was long past the time at which , for many years , he had put it in his pocket and gone with measured steps downstairs to the business of the day , but he took as little heed of its monotonous warning , as of the meat and drink before him , and remained with his head resting on one hand , and his eyes fixed moodily on the ground . This departure from his regular and constant habit , in one so regular and unvarying in all that appertained to the daily pursuit of riches , would almost of itself have told that the usurer was not well . That he laboured under some mental or bodily indisposition , and that it was one of no slight kind so to affect a man like him , was sufficiently shown by his haggard face , jaded air , and hollow languid eyes : which he raised at last with a start and a hasty glance around him , as one who suddenly awakes from sleep , and can not immediately recognise the place in which he finds himself . ‘
374601	374605	374081	374081	I	0	’ he said , ‘
374652	374661	374646	374647	a man	625	’ He pressed his hand upon his forehead . ‘
374769	374802	374762	374762	I	0	’ Pushing the table from him while he spoke , as though he loathed the sight of food , he encountered the watch : the hands of which were almost upon noon . ‘
374807	374811	374762	374762	I	0	’ he said ; ‘
374948	375010	374939	374939	I	0	’ After waiting for another half - hour , he dispatched the woman who kept his house to Newman ’s lodging , to inquire if he were ill , and why he had not come or sent . She brought back answer that he had not been home all night , and that no one could tell her anything about him . ‘
375019	375023	375017	375017	sir	714	’ she said , ‘
375040	375041	375038	375038	he	1059	’ ‘
375046	375055	375044	375044	he	1059	’ demanded Ralph , turning angrily upon her . ‘
375064	375065	375066	375066	He	1059	’ ‘
375069	375079	375066	375066	He	1059	’ replied the woman , abashed by his harshness , ‘
375101	375102	375094	375094	I	0	’ ‘
375112	375116	375094	375094	I	0	’ said Ralph . ‘

375165	375169	375170	375170	they	622	’ muttered Ralph ; ‘
375195	375224	375182	375182	You	0	’ The woman replied that he was in the little office , and that she had said her master was engaged , but she would take the message . ‘
375227	375231	375182	375182	You	0	’ said Ralph , ‘
375252	375444	375248	375248	you	0	’ Glad to be released , the woman quickly disappeared . Collecting himself , and assuming as much of his accustomed manner as his utmost resolution could summon , Ralph descended the stairs . After pausing for a few moments , with his hand upon the lock , he entered Newman ’s room , and confronted Mr. Charles Cheeryble . Of all men alive , this was one of the last he would have wished to meet at any time ; but , now that he recognised in him only the patron and protector of Nicholas , he would rather have seen a spectre . One beneficial effect , however , the encounter had upon him . It instantly roused all his dormant energies ; rekindled in his breast the passions that , for many years , had found an improving home there ; called up all his wrath , hatred , and malice ; restored the sneer to his lip , and the scowl to his brow ; and made him again , in all outward appearance , the same Ralph Nickleby whom so many had bitter cause to remember . ‘
375447	375456	375248	375248	you	0	’ said Ralph , pausing at the door . ‘

375496	375500	375487	375487	Men	8646	’ replied Ralph . ‘

375542	375547	375550	375550	sir	714	’ began brother Charles . ‘
375552	375556	375550	375550	sir	714	’ interrupted Ralph , ‘

375642	375659	375630	375630	me	0	’ repeated brother Charles mildly , and looking at him with more of pity than reproach . ‘
375667	375668	375669	375669	You	714	’ ‘
375686	375690	375692	375692	you	714	’ said Ralph ; ‘

375732	375747	375727	375728	Mr. Nickleby	208	’ returned brother Charles : no less mildly than before , but firmly too : ‘
375837	375869	375828	375828	your	714	’ Ralph glanced keenly at him , but the clear eye and open countenance of the honest old merchant underwent no change of expression , and met his look without reserve . ‘
375875	375880	375871	375871	I	0	’ said Mr. Cheeryble . ‘
375891	375896	375888	375888	you	714	’ returned Ralph drily . ‘
375964	376005	375946	375946	you	714	’ So saying , he buttoned his coat , and turning into the passage , took down his hat . The old gentleman followed , and was about to speak , when Ralph waved him off impatiently , and said : ‘
376064	376065	376056	376056	I	0	’ ‘
376074	376083	376068	376069	no angel	7763	’ returned brother Charles , shaking his head , ‘

376198	376205	376209	376209	his	7768	’ exclaimed the old merchant warmly ; ‘
376396	376464	376496	376496	Pho	600	’ With these words , uttered with great emphasis and emotion , brother Charles put on his broad - brimmed hat , and , passing Ralph Nickleby without any other remark , trotted nimbly into the street . Ralph looked after him , but neither moved nor spoke for some time : when he broke what almost seemed the silence of stupefaction , by a scornful laugh . ‘
376467	376471	376496	376496	Pho	600	’ he said , ‘
376505	376664	376498	376500	The old simpleton	7780	’ Although he expressed himself in this derisive and contemptuous manner , it was plain that , the more Ralph pondered , the more ill at ease he became , and the more he laboured under some vague anxiety and alarm , which increased as the time passed on and no tidings of Newman Noggs arrived . After waiting until late in the afternoon , tortured by various apprehensions and misgivings , and the recollection of the warning which his nephew had given him when they last met : the further confirmation of which now presented itself in one shape of probability , now in another , and haunted him perpetually : he left home , and , scarcely knowing why , save that he was in a suspicious and agitated mood , betook himself to Snawley ’s house . His wife presented herself ; and , of her , Ralph inquired whether her husband was at home . ‘
376667	376672	376498	376500	The old simpleton	7780	’ she said sharply , ‘

378635	378729	378632	378633	brother Ned	488	‘ the matter upon which my brother Charles called upon you this morning is one which is already perfectly well known to us three , and to others besides , and must unhappily soon become known to a great many more . He waited upon you , sir , this morning , alone , as a matter of delicacy and consideration . We feel , now , that further delicacy and consideration would be misplaced ; and , if we confer together , it must be as we are or not at all . ’
378730	378735	378737	378737	Ralph	208	‘ Well , gentlemen , ’
378745	378800	378737	378737	Ralph	208	‘ talking in riddles would seem to be the peculiar forte of you two , and I suppose your clerk , like a prudent man , has studied the art also with a view to your good graces . Talk in company , gentlemen , in God ’s name . I ’ll humour you . ’

And now , if you please , gentlemen , I wish to know -- I demand to know ; I have the right -- what you have to say to me , which justifies such a tone as you have assumed , and that underhand interference in my affairs which , I have reason to suppose , you have been practising . I tell you plainly , gentlemen , that little as I care for the opinion of the world ( as the slang goes ) , I do n’t choose to submit quietly to slander and malice . Whether you suffer yourselves to be imposed upon too easily , or wilfully make yourselves parties to it , the result to me is the same . In either case , you ca n’t expect from a plain man like myself much consideration or forbearance . ’
379168	379174	379176	379177	brother Charles	489	‘ Very well , sir , ’
379179	379192	379176	379177	brother Charles	489	‘ Very well . Brother Ned , will you ring the bell ? ’
379193	379204	379206	379207	the other	8439	‘ Charles , my dear fellow ! stop one instant , ’
379209	379248	379206	379207	the other	8439	‘ It will be better for Mr. Nickleby and for our object that he should remain silent , if he can , till we have said what we have to say . I wish him to understand that . ’
379249	379256	379258	379259	brother Charles	489	‘ Quite right , quite right , ’

379327	379410	379323	379323	he	208	‘ Oh ! this is a good beginning . You are candid , honest , open - hearted , fair - dealing men ! I always knew the real worth of such characters as yours ! To tamper with a fellow like this , who would sell his soul ( if he had one ) for drink , and whose every word is a lie . What men are safe if this is done ? Oh , it ’s a good beginning ! ’
379411	379416	379418	379418	Newman	211	‘ I WILL speak , ’
379437	379679	379323	379323	he	208	‘ Hallo , you sir -- old Nickleby!--what do you mean when you talk of “ a fellow like this ” ? Who made me “ a fellow like this ” ? If I would sell my soul for drink , why was n’t I a thief , swindler , housebreaker , area sneak , robber of pence out of the trays of blind men ’s dogs , rather than your drudge and packhorse ? If my every word was a lie , why was n’t I a pet and favourite of yours ? Lie ! When did I ever cringe and fawn to you . Tell me that ! I served you faithfully . I did more work , because I was poor , and took more hard words from you because I despised you and them , than any man you could have got from the parish workhouse . I did . I served you because I was proud ; because I was a lonely man with you , and there were no other drudges to see my degradation ; and because nobody knew , better than you , that I was a ruined man : that I had n’t always been what I am : and that I might have been better off , if I had n’t been a fool and fallen into the hands of you and others who were knaves . Do you deny that ? ’
379680	379683	379685	379685	Tim	482	‘ Gently , ’
379687	379694	379685	379685	Tim	482	‘ you said you would n’t . ’
379695	379702	379704	379704	Newman	211	‘ I said I would n’t ! ’
379728	379856	379857	379857	Ralph	208	‘ do n’t tell me ! Here , you Nickleby ! Do n’t pretend not to mind me ; it wo n’t do ; I know better . You were talking of tampering , just now . Who tampered with Yorkshire schoolmasters , and , while they sent the drudge out , that he should n’t overhear , forgot that such great caution might render him suspicious , and that he might watch his master out at nights , and might set other eyes to watch the schoolmaster ? Who tampered with a selfish father , urging him to sell his daughter to old Arthur Gride , and tampered with Gride too , and did so in the little office , WITH A CLOSET IN THE ROOM ? ’
379889	379892	379894	379894	Newman	211	‘ Aha ! ’
379896	380045	379894	379894	Newman	211	‘ you mind me now , do you ? What first set this fag to be jealous of his master ’s actions , and to feel that , if he had n’t crossed him when he might , he would have been as bad as he , or worse ? That master ’s cruel treatment of his own flesh and blood , and vile designs upon a young girl who interested even his broken - down , drunken , miserable hack , and made him linger in his service , in the hope of doing her some good ( as , thank God , he had done others once or twice before ) , when he would , otherwise , have relieved his feelings by pummelling his master soundly , and then going to the Devil . He would -- mark that ; and mark this -- that I ’m

Ralph looked at him for an instant , and for an instant only ; then , waved his hand , and beating the ground with his foot , said in a choking voice : ‘
380286	380326	380285	380285	I	0	’m patient , you see . There ’s law to be had , there ’s law . I shall call you to an account for this . Take care what you say ; I shall make you prove it . ’
380327	380333	380335	380336	brother Charles	489	‘ The proof is ready , ’
380338	380356	380335	380336	brother Charles	489	‘ quite ready to our hands . The man Snawley , last night , made a confession . ’
380357	380367	380369	380369	Ralph	208	‘ Who may “ the man Snawley ” be , ’
380371	380386	380369	380369	Ralph	208	‘ and what may his “ confession ” have to do with my affairs ? ’
381614	381621	381623	381625	the old gentleman	8480	‘ I told you this morning , ’
381636	381872	381623	381625	the old gentleman	8480	‘ that I came to you in mercy . How far you may be implicated in this last transaction , or how far the person who is now in custody may criminate you , you best know . But , justice must take its course against the parties implicated in the plot against this poor , unoffending , injured lad . It is not in my power , or in the power of my brother Ned , to save you from the consequences . The utmost we can do is , to warn you in time , and to give you an opportunity of escaping them . We would not have an old man like you disgraced and punished by your near relation ; nor would we have him forget , like you , all ties of blood and nature . We entreat you -- brother Ned , you join me , I know , in this entreaty , and so , Tim Linkinwater , do you , although you pretend to be an obstinate dog , sir , and sit there frowning as if you didn’t -- we entreat you to retire from London , to take shelter in some place where you will be safe from the consequences of these wicked designs , and where you may have time , sir , to atone for them , and to become a better man . ’
381873	381879	381881	381881	Ralph	208	‘ And do you think , ’
381885	382001	381881	381881	Ralph	208	‘ and do you think , you will so easily crush ME ? Do you think that a hundred well - arranged plans , or a hundred suborned witnesses , or a hundred false curs at my heels , or a hundred canting speeches full of oily words , will move me ? I thank you for disclosing your schemes , which I am now prepared for . You have not the man to deal with that you think ; try me ! and remember that I spit upon your fair words and false dealings , and dare you -- provoke you -- taunt you -- to do to me the very worst you can ! ’
382364	382382	382471	382472	Mr. Squeers	203	‘ I say , young fellow , you ’ve been and done it now ; you have ! ’
382383	382392	382394	382394	Ralph	208	‘ What ’s the matter with your head ? ’
382396	382413	382415	382415	Squeers	203	‘ Why , your man , your informing kidnapping man , has been and broke it , ’
382418	382437	382415	382415	Squeers	203	‘ that ’s what ’s the matter with it . You ’ve come at last , have you ? ’

382451	382464	382449	382449	Ralph	208	‘ How could I come till I knew what had befallen you ? ’
382465	382469	382471	382472	Mr. Squeers	203	‘ My family ! ’

The coat - of - arms of the Squeerses is tore , and their sun is gone down into the ocean wave ! ’
382556	382562	382564	382564	Ralph	208	‘ You have been drinking , ’
382566	382575	382564	382564	Ralph	208	‘ and have not yet slept yourself sober . ’
382576	382588	382590	382591	Mr. Squeers	203	‘ I have n’t been drinking YOUR health , my codger , ’
382593	382603	382590	382591	Mr. Squeers	203	‘ so you have nothing to do with that . ’
382629	382639	382641	382641	Squeers	203	‘ What should I get by sending to you ? ’
382643	382693	382641	382641	Squeers	203	‘ To be known to be in with you would n’t do me a deal of good , and they wo n’t take bail till they know something more of the case , so here am I hard and fast : and there are you , loose and comfortable . ’
382694	382705	382707	382707	Ralph	208	‘ And so must you be in a few days , ’

382725	382760	382762	382762	Squeers	203	‘ Why , I suppose they ca n’t do much to me , if I explain how it was that I got into the good company of that there ca - daverous old Slider , ’
382765	383037	382762	382762	Squeers	203	‘ who I wish was dead and buried , and resurrected and dissected , and hung upon wires in a anatomical museum , before ever I ’d had anything to do with her . This is what him with the powdered head says this morning , in so many words : “ Prisoner ! As you have been found in company with this woman ; as you were detected in possession of this document ; as you were engaged with her in fraudulently destroying others , and can give no satisfactory account of yourself ; I shall remand you for a week , in order that inquiries may be made , and evidence got . And meanwhile I ca n’t take any bail for your appearance . ” Well then , what I say now is , that I CAN give a satisfactory account of myself ; I can hand in the card of my establishment and say , “ I am the Wackford Squeers as is therein named , sir . I am the man as is guaranteed , by unimpeachable references , to be a out - and - outer in morals and uprightness of principle . Whatever is wrong in this business is no fault of mine . I had no evil design in it , sir . I was not aware that anything was wrong . I was merely employed by a friend , my friend Mr. Ralph Nickleby , of Golden Square . Send for him , sir , and ask him what he has to say ; he ’s the man ; not me ! ” ’

383075	383096	383073	383073	Squeers	203	‘ The Madeline What’s - her - name one . It was a will ; that ’s what it was . ’
383097	383116	383118	383118	Ralph	208	‘ Of what nature , whose will , when dated , how benefiting her , to what extent ? ’
383121	383134	383136	383136	Squeers	203	‘ A will in her favour ; that ’s all I know , ’
383138	383217	383136	383136	Squeers	203	‘ and that ’s more than you ’d have known , if you ’d had them bellows on your head . It ’s all owing to your precious caution that they got hold of it . If you had let me burn it , and taken my word that it was gone , it would have been a heap of ashes behind the fire , instead of being whole and sound , inside of my great - coat . ’

I an’t a - going to have any stories made for me , and I an’t a - going to stick to any . If I find matters going again me , I shall expect you to take your share , and I ’ll take care you do . You never said anything about danger . I never bargained for being brought into such a plight as this , and I do n’t mean to take it as quiet as you think . I let you lead me on , from one thing to another , because we had been mixed up together in a certain sort of a way , and if you had liked to be ill - natured you might perhaps have hurt the business , and if you liked to be good - natured you might throw a good deal in my way . Well ; if all goes right now , that ’s quite correct , and I do n’t mind it ; but if anything goes wrong , then times are altered , and I shall just say and do whatever I think may serve me most , and take advice from nobody . My moral influence with them lads , ’
383843	383917	383836	383837	Mr. Squeers	203	‘ is a tottering to its basis . The images of Mrs. Squeers , my daughter , and my son Wackford , all short of vittles , is perpetually before me ; every other consideration melts away and vanishes , in front of these ; the only number in all arithmetic that I know of , as a husband and a father , is number one , under this here most fatal go ! ’
384008	384017	384019	384019	Ralph	208	‘ As I supposed from his not sending ! ’

If , in telling you how this has happened , I tell you that I was harshly used , and perhaps driven out of my real nature , I do it only as a necessary part of my story , and not to shield myself . I am a guilty man . ’
386315	386418	386302	386302	himself	8927	‘ Among those who once had dealings with this man , gentlemen -- that ’s from twenty to five - and - twenty years ago -- there was one : a rough fox - hunting , hard - drinking gentleman , who had run through his own fortune , and wanted to squander away that of his sister : they were both orphans , and she lived with him and managed his house . I do n’t know whether it was , originally , to back his influence and try to over - persuade the young woman or not , but he , ’
386424	386836	386838	386838	he	7940	‘ used to go down to the house in Leicestershire pretty often , and stop there many days at a time . They had had a great many dealings together , and he may have gone on some of those , or to patch up his client ’s affairs , which were in a ruinous state ; of course he went for profit . The gentlewoman was not a girl , but she was , I have heard say , handsome , and entitled to a pretty large property . In course of time , he married her . The same love of gain which led him to contract this marriage , led to its being kept strictly private ; for a clause in her father ’s will declared that if she married without her brother ’s consent , the property , in which she had only some life interest while she remained single , should pass away altogether to another branch of the family . The brother would give no consent that the sister did n’t buy , and pay for handsomely ; Mr. Nickleby would consent to no such sacrifice ; and so they went on , keeping their marriage secret , and waiting for him to break his neck or die of a fever . He did neither , and meanwhile the result of this private marriage was a son . The child was put out to nurse , a long way off ; his mother never saw him but once or twice , and then by stealth ; and his father -- so eagerly did he thirst after the money which seemed to come almost within his grasp now , for his brother - in - law was very ill , and breaking more and more every day -- never went near him , to avoid raising any suspicion . The brother lingered on ; Mr. Nickleby ’s wife constantly urged him to avow their marriage ; he peremptorily refused . She remained alone in a dull country house : seeing little or no company but riotous , drunken sportsmen . He lived in London and clung to his business . Angry quarrels and recriminations took place , and when they had been married nearly seven years , and were within a few weeks of the time when the brother ’s death would have adjusted all , she eloped with a younger man , and left him . ’
386856	387015	387016	387016	He	7942	‘ It was then that I became acquainted with these circumstances from his own lips . They were no secrets then ; for the brother , and others , knew them ; but they were communicated to me , not on this account , but because I was wanted . He followed the fugitives . Some said to make money of his wife ’s shame , but , I believe , to take some violent revenge , for that was as much his character as the other ; perhaps more . He did n’t find them , and she died not long after . I do n’t know whether he began to think he might like the child , or whether he wished to make sure that it should never fall into its mother ’s hands ; but , before he went , he intrusted me with the charge of bringing it home . And I did so . ’
387046	387594	387597	387597	I	0	‘ He had used me ill -- cruelly -- I reminded him in what , not long ago when I met him in the street -- and I hated him . I brought the child home to his own house , and lodged him in the front garret . Neglect had made him very sickly , and I was obliged to call in a doctor , who said he must be removed for change of air , or he would die . I think that first put it in my head . I did it then . He was gone six weeks , and when he came back , I told him -- with every circumstance well planned and proved ; nobody could have suspected me -- that the child was dead and buried . He might have been disappointed in some intention he had formed , or he might have had some natural affection , but he WAS grieved at THAT , and I was confirmed in my design of opening up the secret one day , and making it a means of getting money from him . I had heard , like most other men , of Yorkshire schools . I took the child to one kept by a man named Squeers , and left it there . I gave him the name of Smike . Year by year , I paid twenty pounds a - year for him for six years ; never breathing the secret all the time ; for I had left his father ’s service after more hard usage , and quarrelled with him again . I was sent away from this country . I have been away nearly eight years . Directly I came home again , I travelled down into Yorkshire , and , skulking in the village of an evening - time , made inquiries about the boys at the school , and found that this one , whom I had placed there , had run away with a young man bearing the name of his own father . I sought his father out in London , and hinting at what I could tell him , tried for a little money to support life ; but he repulsed me with threats . I then found out his clerk , and , going on from little to little , and showing him that there were good reasons for communicating with me , learnt what was going on ; and it was I who told him that the boy was no son of the man who claimed to be his father . All this time I had never seen the boy . At length , I heard from this same source that he was very ill , and where he was . I travelled down there , that I might recall myself , if possible , to his recollection and confirm my story . I came upon him unexpectedly ; but before I could speak he knew me -- he had good cause to remember me , poor lad!--and I would have sworn to him if I had met him in the Indies . I knew the piteous face I had seen in the little child . After a few days ’

There was some trifling confusion in obtaining another light ; the interval was a mere nothing ; but when the light appeared , Ralph Nickleby was gone . The good brothers and Tim Linkinwater occupied some time in discussing the probability of his return ; and , when it became apparent that he would not come back , they hesitated whether or no to send after him . At length , remembering how strangely and silently he had sat in one immovable position during the interview , and thinking he might possibly be ill , they determined , although it was now very late , to send to his house on some pretence . Finding an excuse in the presence of Brooker , whom they knew not how to dispose of without consulting his wishes , they concluded to act upon this resolution before going to bed . CHAPTER 61 Wherein Nicholas and his Sister forfeit the good Opinion of all worldly and prudent People On the next morning after Brooker ’s disclosure had been made , Nicholas returned home . The meeting between him and those whom he had left there was not without strong emotion on both sides ; for they had been informed by his letters of what had occurred : and , besides that his griefs were theirs , they mourned with him the death of one whose forlorn and helpless state had first established a claim upon their compassion , and whose truth of heart and grateful earnest nature had , every day , endeared him to them more and more . ‘

388510	388653	388502	388502	nobody	8541	’ While Mrs. Nickleby , with the utmost sincerity , gave vent to her sorrows after her own peculiar fashion of considering herself foremost , she was not the only one who indulged such feelings . Kate , although well accustomed to forget herself when others were to be considered , could not repress her grief ; Madeline was scarcely less moved than she ; and poor , hearty , honest little Miss La Creevy , who had come upon one of her visits while Nicholas was away , and had done nothing , since the sad news arrived , but console and cheer them all , no sooner beheld him coming in at the door , than she sat herself down upon the stairs , and bursting into a flood of tears , refused for a long time to be comforted . ‘

Sometimes , I try to think that the time may come when I may honestly tell her this ; but it is so far off ; in such distant perspective , so many years must elapse before it comes , and when it does come ( if ever ) I shall be so unlike what I am now , and shall have so outlived my days of youth and romance -- though not , I am sure , of love for her -- that even I feel how visionary all such hopes must be , and try to crush them rudely myself , and have the pain over , rather than suffer time to wither them , and keep the disappointment in store . No , Kate ! Since I have been absent , I have had , in that poor fellow who is gone , perpetually before my eyes , another instance of the munificent liberality of these noble brothers . As far as in me lies , I will deserve it , and if I have wavered in my bounden duty to them before , I am now determined to discharge it rigidly , and to put further delays and temptations beyond my reach . ’

How base would it be of me to take advantage of the circumstances which placed her here , or of the slight service I was happily able to render her , and to seek to engage her affections when the result must be , if I succeeded , that the brothers would be disappointed in their darling wish of establishing her as their own child , and that I must seem to hope to build my fortunes on their compassion for the young creature whom I had so meanly and unworthily entrapped : turning her very gratitude and warmth of heart to my own purpose and account , and trading in her misfortunes ! I , too , whose duty , and pride , and pleasure , Kate , it is to have other claims upon me which I will never forget ; and who have the means of a comfortable and happy life already , and have no right to look beyond it ! I have determined to remove this weight from my mind . I doubt whether I have not done wrong , even now ; and today I will , without reserve or equivocation , disclose my real reasons to Mr Cherryble , and implore him to take immediate measures for removing this young lady to the shelter of some other roof . ’

If the scene through which I have just passed has taught me to reflect , and has awakened me to a more anxious and careful sense of duty , why should I wait until the impression has cooled ? You would not dissuade me , Kate ; now would you ? ’

What if we have but one home ? It can never be a solitary one to you and me . What if we were to remain so true to these first impressions as to form no others ? It is but one more link to the strong chain that binds us together . It seems but yesterday that we were playfellows , Kate , and it will seem but tomorrow when we are staid old people , looking back to these cares as we look back , now , to those of our childish days : and recollecting with a melancholy pleasure that the time was , when they could move us . Perhaps then , when we are quaint old folks and talk of the times when our step was lighter and our hair not grey , we may be even thankful for the trials that so endeared us to each other , and turned our lives into that current , down which we shall have glided so peacefully and calmly . And having caught some inkling of our story , the young people about us -- as young as you and I are now , Kate -- may come to us for sympathy , and pour distresses which hope and inexperience could scarcely feel enough for , into the compassionate ears of the old bachelor brother and his maiden sister . ’

When you first took me into your confidence , and dispatched me on those missions to Miss Bray , I should have told you that I had seen her long before ; that her beauty had made an impression upon me which I could not efface ; and that I had fruitlessly endeavoured to trace her , and become acquainted with her history . I did not tell you so , because I vainly thought I could conquer my weaker feelings , and render every consideration subservient to my duty to you . ’

But I find that constant association and companionship with this sweet girl is fatal to my peace of mind , and may prove destructive to the resolutions I made in the beginning , and up to this time have faithfully kept . In short , sir , I can not trust myself , and I implore and beseech you to remove this young lady from under the charge of my mother and sister without delay . I know that to anyone but myself -- to you , who consider the immeasurable distance between me and this young lady , who is now your ward , and the object of your peculiar care -- my loving her , even in thought , must appear the height of rashness and presumption . I know it is so . But who can see her as I have seen , who can know what her life has been , and not love her ? I have no excuse but that ; and as I can not fly from this temptation , and can not repress this passion , with its object constantly before me , what can I do but pray and beseech you to remove it , and to leave me to forget her ? ’

393680	394977	394985	394986	The wretch	8022	’ bodies , and had struck their roots in the graves of men , sodden , while alive , in steaming courts and drunken hungry dens . And here , in truth , they lay , parted from the living by a little earth and a board or two -- lay thick and close -- corrupting in body as they had in mind -- a dense and squalid crowd . Here they lay , cheek by jowl with life : no deeper down than the feet of the throng that passed there every day , and piled high as their throats . Here they lay , a grisly family , all these dear departed brothers and sisters of the ruddy clergyman who did his task so speedily when they were hidden in the ground ! As he passed here , Ralph called to mind that he had been one of a jury , long before , on the body of a man who had cut his throat ; and that he was buried in this place . He could not tell how he came to recollect it now , when he had so often passed and never thought about him , or how it was that he felt an interest in the circumstance ; but he did both ; and stopping , and clasping the iron railings with his hands , looked eagerly in , wondering which might be his grave . While he was thus engaged , there came towards him , with noise of shouts and singing , some fellows full of drink , followed by others , who were remonstrating with them and urging them to go home in quiet . They were in high good - humour ; and one of them , a little , weazen , hump - backed man , began to dance . He was a grotesque , fantastic figure , and the few bystanders laughed . Ralph himself was moved to mirth , and echoed the laugh of one who stood near and who looked round in his face . When they had passed on , and he was left alone again , he resumed his speculation with a new kind of interest ; for he recollected that the last person who had seen the suicide alive , had left him very merry , and he remembered how strange he and the other jurors had thought that at the time . He could not fix upon the spot among such a heap of graves , but he conjured up a strong and vivid idea of the man himself , and how he looked , and what had led him to do it ; all of which he recalled with ease . By dint of dwelling upon this theme , he carried the impression with him when he went away ; as he remembered , when a child , to have had frequently before him the figure of some goblin he had once seen chalked upon a door . But as he drew nearer and nearer home he forgot it again , and began to think how very dull and solitary the house would be inside . This feeling became so strong at last , that when he reached his own door , he could hardly make up his mind to turn the key and open it . When he had done that , and gone into the passage , he felt as though to shut it again would be to shut out the world . But he let it go , and it closed with a loud noise . There was no light . How very dreary , cold , and still it was ! Shivering from head to foot , he made his way upstairs into the room where he had been last disturbed . He had made a kind of compact with himself that he would not think of what had happened until he got home . He was at home now , and suffered himself to consider it . His own child , his own child ! He never doubted the tale ; he felt it was true ; knew it as well , now , as if he had been privy to it all along . His own child ! And dead too . Dying beside Nicholas , loving him , and looking upon him as something like an angel . That was the worst ! They had all turned from him and deserted him in his very first need . Even money could not buy them now ; everything must come out , and everybody must know all . Here was the young lord dead , his companion abroad and beyond his reach , ten thousand pounds gone at one blow , his plot with Gride overset at the very moment of triumph , his after - schemes discovered , himself in danger , the object of his persecution and Nicholas ’s love , his own wretched boy ; everything crumbled and fallen upon him , and he beaten down beneath the ruins and grovelling in the dust . If he had known his child to be alive ; if no deceit had been ever practised , and he had grown up beneath his eye ; he might have been a careless , indifferent , rough , harsh father -- like enough -- he felt that ; but the thought would come that he might have been otherwise , and that his son might have been a comfort to him , and they two happy together . He began to think now , that his supposed death and his wife ’s flight had had some share in making him the morose , hard man he was . He seemed to remember a time when he was not quite so rough and obdurate ; and almost thought that he had first hated Nicholas because he was young and gallant , and perhaps like the stripling who had brought dishonour and loss of fortune on his head . But one tender thought , or one of natural regret , in his whirlwind of passion and remorse , was as a drop of calm water in a stormy maddened sea . His hatred of Nicholas had been fed upon his own defeat , nourished on his interference with his schemes , fattened upon his old defiance and success . There were reasons for its increase ; it had grown and strengthened gradually . Now it attained a height which was sheer wild lunacy . That his , of all others , should have been the hands to rescue his miserable child ; that he should have been his protector and faithful friend ; that he should have shown him that love and tenderness which , from the wretched moment of his birth , he had never known ; that he should have taught him to hate his own parent and execrate his very name ; that he should now know and feel all this , and triumph in the recollection ; was gall and madness to the usurer ’s heart . The dead boy ’s love for Nicholas , and the attachment of Nicholas to him , was insupportable agony . The picture of his deathbed , with Nicholas at his side , tending and supporting him , and he breathing out his thanks , and expiring in his arms , when he would have had them mortal enemies and hating each other to the last , drove him frantic . He gnashed his teeth and smote the air , and looking wildly round , with eyes which gleamed through the darkness , cried aloud : ‘
395022	395420	395421	395421	I	0	’ Swiftly , there glided again into his brain the figure he had raised that night . It seemed to lie before him . The head was covered now . So it was when he first saw it . The rigid , upturned , marble feet too , he remembered well . Then came before him the pale and trembling relatives who had told their tale upon the inquest -- the shrieks of women -- the silent dread of men -- the consternation and disquiet -- the victory achieved by that heap of clay , which , with one motion of its hand , had let out the life and made this stir among them-- He spoke no more ; but , after a pause , softly groped his way out of the room , and up the echoing stairs -- up to the top -- to the front garret -- where he closed the door behind him , and remained . It was a mere lumber - room now , but it yet contained an old dismantled bedstead ; the one on which his son had slept ; for no other had ever been there . He avoided it hastily , and sat down as far from it as he could . The weakened glare of the lights in the street below , shining through the window which had no blind or curtain to intercept it , was enough to show the character of the room , though not sufficient fully to reveal the various articles of lumber , old corded trunks and broken furniture , which were scattered about . It had a shelving roof ; high in one part , and at another descending almost to the floor . It was towards the highest part that Ralph directed his eyes ; and upon it he kept them fixed steadily for some minutes , when he rose , and dragging thither an old chest upon which he had been seated , mounted on it , and felt along the wall above his head with both hands . At length , they touched a large iron hook , firmly driven into one of the beams . At that moment , he was interrupted by a loud knocking at the door below . After a little hesitation he opened the window , and demanded who it was . ‘
395426	395431	395423	395424	Mr. Nickleby	208	’ replied a voice . ‘
395436	395437	395441	395442	Mr. Nickleby	208	’ ‘
395448	395514	395441	395442	Mr. Nickleby	208	’ was the rejoinder . It was not like it ; but it was Ralph who spoke , and so he said . The voice made answer that the twin brothers wished to know whether the man whom he had seen that night was to be detained ; and that although it was now midnight they had sent , in their anxiety to do right . ‘
395517	395521	395541	395541	themselves	8024	’ cried Ralph , ‘
395555	395556	395541	395541	themselves	8024	’ ‘
395561	395566	395541	395541	themselves	8024	’ asked the voice . ‘
395571	395576	395541	395541	themselves	8024	’ replied Ralph fiercely . ‘
395600	395654	395655	395655	I	0	’ He listened to the man ’s retreating footsteps until the sound had passed , and then , gazing up into the sky , saw , or thought he saw , the same black cloud that had seemed to follow him home , and which now appeared to hover directly above the house . ‘
395661	395665	395655	395655	I	0	’ he muttered , ‘
395714	395728	395709	395709	I	0	’ The sound of a deep bell came along the wind . One . ‘

395828	395918	395931	395931	they	8574	’ With a wild look around , in which frenzy , hatred , and despair were horribly mingled , he shook his clenched hand at the sky above him , which was still dark and threatening , and closed the window . The rain and hail pattered against the glass ; the chimneys quaked and rocked ; the crazy casement rattled with the wind , as though an impatient hand inside were striving to burst it open . But no hand was there , and it opened no more . ‘
395923	395927	395928	395929	The gentleman	8574	’ cried one . ‘
395946	395947	395931	395931	they	8574	’ ‘
395956	395960	395950	395950	he	8574	’ said another ; ‘
395972	396204	395962	395962	he	8574	’ They were a little knot of men , and , the window being mentioned , went out into the road to look up at it . This occasioned their observing that the house was still close shut , as the housekeeper had said she had left it on the previous night , and led to a great many suggestions : which terminated in two or three of the boldest getting round to the back , and so entering by a window , while the others remained outside , in impatient expectation . They looked into all the rooms below : opening the shutters as they went , to admit the fading light : and still finding nobody , and everything quiet and in its place , doubted whether they should go farther . One man , however , remarking that they had not yet been into the garret , and that it was there he had been last seen , they agreed to look there too , and went up softly ; for the mystery and silence made them timid . After they had stood for an instant , on the landing , eyeing each other , he who had proposed their carrying the search so far , turned the handle of the door , and , pushing it open , looked through the chink , and fell back directly . ‘
396210	396214	396215	396215	he	8038	’ he whispered , ‘
396224	396468	396215	396215	he	8038	’ They pressed forward to see ; but one among them thrusting the others aside with a loud exclamation , drew a clasp - knife from his pocket , and dashing into the room , cut down the body . He had torn a rope from one of the old trunks , and hung himself on an iron hook immediately below the trap - door in the ceiling -- in the very place to which the eyes of his son , a lonely , desolate , little creature , had so often been directed in childish terror , fourteen years before . CHAPTER 63 The Brothers Cheeryble make various Declarations for themselves and others . Tim Linkinwater makes a Declaration for himself Some weeks had passed , and the first shock of these events had subsided . Madeline had been removed ; Frank had been absent ; and Nicholas and Kate had begun to try in good earnest to stifle their own regrets , and to live for each other and for their mother -- who , poor lady , could in nowise be reconciled to this dull and altered state of affairs -- when there came one evening , per favour of Mr. Linkinwater , an invitation from the brothers to dinner on the next day but one : comprehending , not only Mrs. Nickleby , Kate , and Nicholas , but little Miss La Creevy , who was most particularly mentioned . ‘

396628	396657	396620	396620	I	0	’ said Mrs. Nickleby , you ’ll find yourself a little surprised ; that ’s all . You may depend upon it that this means something besides dinner . ’
396658	396665	396667	396667	Nicholas	207	‘ Tea and supper , perhaps , ’
396669	396684	396686	396687	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ I would n’t be absurd , my dear , if I were you , ’
396694	396806	396686	396687	Mrs. Nickleby	207	‘ because it ’s not by any means becoming , and does n’t suit you at all . What I mean to say is , that the Mr. Cheerybles do n’t ask us to dinner with all this ceremony for nothing . Never mind ; wait and see . You wo n’t believe anything I say , of course . It ’s much better to wait ; a great deal better ; it ’s satisfactory to all parties , and there can be no disputing . All I say is , remember what I say now , and when I say I said so , do n’t say I did n’t . ’
396858	396866	396867	396867	she	207	‘ It ’s a very extraordinary thing , ’
396870	396950	396867	396867	she	207	‘ a most extraordinary thing , that they should have invited Miss La Creevy . It quite astonishes me , upon my word it does . Of course it ’s very pleasant that she should be invited , very pleasant , and I have no doubt that she ’ll conduct herself extremely well ; she always does . It ’s very gratifying to think that we should have been the means of introducing her into such society , and I ’m
397050	397514	397044	397044	I	0	’ This moral reflection reminding her of the necessity of being peculiarly smart on the occasion , so as to counterbalance Miss La Creevy , and be herself an effectual set - off and atonement , led Mrs. Nickleby into a consultation with her daughter relative to certain ribbons , gloves , and trimmings : which , being a complicated question , and one of paramount importance , soon routed the previous one , and put it to flight . The great day arriving , the good lady put herself under Kate ’s hands an hour or so after breakfast , and , dressing by easy stages , completed her toilette in sufficient time to allow of her daughter ’s making hers , which was very simple , and not very long , though so satisfactory that she had never appeared more charming or looked more lovely . Miss La Creevy , too , arrived with two bandboxes ( whereof the bottoms fell out as they were handed from the coach ) and something in a newspaper , which a gentleman had sat upon , coming down , and which was obliged to be ironed again , before it was fit for service . At last , everybody was dressed , including Nicholas , who had come home to fetch them , and they went away in a coach sent by the brothers for the purpose : Mrs. Nickleby wondering very much what they would have for dinner , and cross - examining Nicholas as to the extent of his discoveries in the morning ; whether he had smelt anything cooking at all like turtle , and if not , what he had smelt ; and diversifying the conversation with reminiscences of dinners to which she had gone some twenty years ago , concerning which she particularised not only the dishes but the guests , in whom her hearers did not feel a very absorbing interest , as not one of them had ever chanced to hear their names before . The old butler received them with profound respect and many smiles , and ushered them into the drawing - room , where they were received by the brothers with so much cordiality and kindness that Mrs. Nickleby was quite in a flutter , and had scarcely presence of mind enough , even to patronise Miss La Creevy . Kate was still more affected by the reception : for , knowing that the brothers were acquainted with all that had passed between her and Frank , she felt her position a most delicate and trying one , and was trembling on the arm of Nicholas , when Mr. Charles took her in his , and led her to another part of the room . ‘

397674	397712	397661	397661	Ned	488	’ said Ned . The brothers interchanged a glance , and looking at Kate for a little time without speaking , shook hands , and nodded as if they were congratulating each other on something very delightful . ‘
397717	397722	397661	397661	Ned	488	’ said brother Charles , ‘
397789	397817	397818	397818	We	8061	’ Kate retired as she was directed . Brother Charles , having followed her graceful figure with his eyes , turned to Mrs. Nickleby , and said : ‘
397877	397927	397865	397866	Mr. Nickleby	208	’ Without any further explanation , Mrs. Nickleby , Miss La Creevy , and brother Ned , were left alone together , and Nicholas followed brother Charles into his private room ; where , to his great astonishment , he encountered Frank , whom he supposed to be abroad . ‘

397961	398025	397959	397959	I	0	’ rejoined Frank , as he clasped it heartily . The old gentleman thought that two handsomer or finer young fellows could scarcely stand side by side than those on whom he looked with so much pleasure . Suffering his eyes to rest upon them , for a short time in silence , he said , while he seated himself at his desk : ‘
398072	398097	398065	398065	you	0	’ The young men stepped up on either hand of brother Charles , who produced a paper from his desk , and unfolded it . ‘

398333	398362	398331	398331	me	0	’ Frank replied in the affirmative . Nicholas , who could not trust himself to speak lest his voice should be heard to falter , bowed his head . ‘
398367	398373	398374	398374	you	481	’ said the old gentleman , ‘

398932	398942	398874	398874	Ned	488	’ said the latter , after a short silence . ‘

399407	399455	399405	399405	Ned	605	‘ Tim is a treacherous dog . Tim is not to be trusted . Tim is a wild young fellow . He wants gravity and steadiness ; he must sow his wild oats , and then perhaps he ’ll become in time a respectable member of society . ’

Let ’s be a comfortable couple , and take care of each other ! And if we should get deaf , or lame , or blind , or bed - ridden , how glad we shall be that we have somebody we are fond of , always to talk to and sit with ! Let ’s be a comfortable couple .

There was the superannuated bank clerk , Tim Linkinwater ’s friend ; and there was the chubby old lady , Tim Linkinwater ’s sister ; and there was so much attention from Tim Linkinwater ’s sister to Miss La Creevy , and there were so many jokes from the superannuated bank clerk , and Tim Linkinwater himself was in such tiptop spirits , and little Miss La Creevy was in such a comical state , that of themselves they would have composed the pleasantest party conceivable . Then , there was Mrs Nickleby , so grand and complacent ; Madeline and Kate , so blushing and beautiful ; Nicholas and Frank , so devoted and proud ; and all four so silently and tremblingly happy ; there was Newman so subdued yet so overjoyed , and there were the twin brothers so delighted and interchanging such looks , that the old servant stood transfixed behind his master ’s chair , and felt his eyes grow dim as they wandered round the table . When the first novelty of the meeting had worn off , and they began truly to feel how happy they were , the conversation became more general , and the harmony and pleasure if possible increased . The brothers were in a perfect ecstasy ; and their insisting on saluting the ladies all round , before they would permit them to retire , gave occasion to the superannuated bank clerk to say so many good things , that he quite outshone himself , and was looked upon as a prodigy of humour . ‘

There , amidst clothes - baskets and clothes , stripped up to his shirt - sleeves , but wearing still an old patched pair of pantaloons of superlative make , a once brilliant waistcoat , and moustache and whiskers as of yore , but lacking their lustrous dye -- there , endeavouring to mollify the wrath of a buxom female -- not the lawful Madame Mantalini , but the proprietress of the concern -- and grinding meanwhile as if for very life at the mangle , whose creaking noise , mingled with her shrill tones , appeared almost to deafen him -- there was the graceful , elegant , fascinating , and once dashing Mantalini . ‘
402744	402758	402740	402740	you	207	’ cried the lady , threatening personal violence on Mr. Mantalini ’s face . ‘
