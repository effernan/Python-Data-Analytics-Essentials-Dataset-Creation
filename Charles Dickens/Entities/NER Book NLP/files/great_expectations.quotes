It were a’most the only hammering he did , indeed , ’ xcepting at myself . And he hammered at me with a wigor only to be equalled by the wigor with which he did n’t hammer at his anwil.—You’re a listening and understanding , Pip ? ”

So , he ’d come with a most tremenjous crowd and make such a row at the doors of the houses where we was , that they used to be obligated to have no more to do with us and to give us up to him . And then he took us home and hammered us . Which , you see , Pip , ”

In time I were able to keep him , and I kep him till he went off in a purple leptic fit . And it were my intentions to have had put upon his tombstone that , Whatsume’er the failings on his part , Remember reader he were that good in his heart . ”

I never was so much surprised in all my life,—couldn’t credit my own ed,—to tell you the truth , hardly believed it _ were _ my own ed . As I was saying , Pip , it were my intentions to have had it cut over him ; but poetry costs money , cut it how you will , small or large , and it were not done . Not to mention bearers , all the money that could be spared were wanted for my mother . She were in poor elth , and quite broke . She were n’t long of following , poor soul , and her share of peace come round at last . ”

Now , when you take me in hand in my learning , Pip ( and I tell you beforehand I am awful dull , most awful dull ) , Mrs. Joe must n’t see too much of what we ’re up to . It must be done , as I may say , on the sly . And why on the sly ? I ’ll tell you why , Pip . ”

34492	34512	34513	34513	Joe	158	“ What ’ll you drink , Mr. — ? You did n’t mention your name , by the bye . ”
34527	34545	34519	34521	the strange man	1306	“ What ’ll you drink , Mr. Gargery ? At my expense ? To top up with ? ”
34546	34549	34551	34551	Joe	158	“ Well , ”
34553	34577	34551	34551	Joe	158	“ to tell you the truth , I ai n’t much in the habit of drinking at anybody ’s expense but my own . ”
34578	34583	34585	34586	the stranger	1301	“ Habit ? No , ”
34588	34612	34585	34586	the stranger	1301	“ but once and away , and on a Saturday night too . Come ! Put a name to it , Mr. Gargery . ”
34613	34623	34625	34625	Joe	158	“ I would n’t wish to be stiff company , ”
34627	34630	34625	34625	Joe	158	“ Rum . ”
34631	34634	34636	34637	the stranger	1301	“ Rum , ”
34639	34649	34636	34637	the stranger	1301	“ And will the other gentleman originate a sentiment . ”
34650	34653	34655	34656	Mr. Wopsle	167	“ Rum , ”

34693	34712	34690	34691	Mr. Wopsle	167	“ is a gentleman that you would like to hear give it out . Our clerk at church . ”
34713	34716	34718	34719	the stranger	1301	“ Aha ! ”
34730	34746	34725	34725	his	1301	“ The lonely church , right out on the marshes , with graves round it ! ”
34747	34752	34754	34754	Joe	158	“ That ’s it , ”
34843	34864	34873	34873	Joe	158	“ I am not acquainted with this country , gentlemen , but it seems a solitary country towards the river . ”
34865	34871	34873	34873	Joe	158	“ Most marshes is solitary , ”
34875	34902	34873	34873	Joe	158	“ No doubt , no doubt . Do you find any gypsies , now , or tramps , or vagrants of any sort , out there ? ”
34903	34906	34908	34908	Joe	158	“ No , ”
34910	34936	34908	34908	Joe	158	“ none but a runaway convict now and then . And we do n’t find _ them _ , easy . Eh , Mr. Wopsle ? ”
34954	34963	34965	34966	the stranger	1301	“ Seems you have been out after such ? ”
34968	34971	34973	34973	Joe	158	“ Once , ”
34975	35009	34973	34973	Joe	158	“ Not that we wanted to take them , you understand ; we went out as lookers on ; me , and Mr. Wopsle , and Pip . Did n’t us , Pip ? ”
35010	35015	35016	35017	The stranger	1301	“ Yes , Joe . ”

36030	36048	36026	36027	Mrs. Joe	158	“ or he would n’t have given it to the boy ! Let ’s look at it . ”
36066	36072	36074	36075	Mrs. Joe	158	“ But what ’s this ? ”
36087	36094	36074	36075	Mrs. Joe	158	“ Two One - Pound notes ? ”
36462	36473	36453	36453	she	196	“ You are to come this way to - day , ”
36669	36684	36665	36665	she	196	“ You are to go and stand there boy , till you are wanted . ”

37142	37156	37158	37159	the gentleman	1390	“ It would be much more commendable to be somebody else ’s enemy , ”
37161	37166	37158	37159	the gentleman	1390	“ far more natural . ”
37167	37171	37173	37174	another lady	1391	“ Cousin Raymond , ”

37289	37364	37269	37269	Camilla	208	“ he is so very strange ! Would anyone believe that when Tom ’s wife died , he actually could not be induced to see the importance of the children ’s having the deepest of trimmings to their mourning ? ‘ Good Lord ! ’ says he , ‘ Camilla , what can it signify so long as the poor bereaved little things are in black ? ’ So like Matthew ! The idea ! ”
37365	37376	37378	37379	Cousin Raymond	209	“ Good points in him , good points in him , ”
37381	37409	37378	37379	Cousin Raymond	209	“ Heaven forbid I should deny good points in him ; but he never had , and he never will have , any sense of the proprieties . ”
37410	37417	37269	37269	Camilla	208	“ You know I was obliged , ”
37419	37523	37269	37269	Camilla	208	Camilla,—“I was obliged to be firm . I said , ‘ It WILL NOT DO , for the credit of the family . ’ I told him that , without deep trimmings , the family was disgraced . I cried about it from breakfast till dinner . I injured my digestion . And at last he flung out in his violent way , and said , with a D , ‘ Then do as you like . ’ Thank Goodness it will always be a consolation to me to know that I instantly went out in a pouring rain and bought the things . ”
37524	37536	37538	37538	Estella	196	“ _ He _ paid for them , did he not ? ”
37540	37556	37558	37558	Camilla	208	“ It ’s not the question , my dear child , who paid for them , ”
37560	37585	37558	37558	Camilla	208	“ _ I _ bought them . And I shall often think of that with peace , when I wake up in the night . ”
37622	37627	37616	37616	Estella	196	“ Now , boy ! ”
37656	37665	37652	37653	Sarah Pocket	210	“ Well I am sure ! What next ! ”
37673	37686	37667	37667	Camilla	208	“ Was there ever such a fancy ! The i - d_e_-a ! ”
37726	37729	37713	37713	her	196	“ Well ? ”
37730	37735	37736	37736	I	0	“ Well , miss ? ”
37764	37769	37747	37747	She	196	“ Am I pretty ? ”
37770	37780	37747	37747	She	196	“ Yes ; I think you are very pretty . ”
37781	37786	37747	37747	She	196	“ Am I insulting ? ”
37787	37798	37800	37800	I.	0	“ Not so much so as you were last time , ”

37860	37867	37822	37822	she	196	“ I shall not tell you . ”
37868	37881	37843	37843	she	196	“ Because you are going to tell upstairs . Is that it ? ”
37882	37885	37887	37887	I	0	“ No , ”
37889	37895	37887	37887	I	0	“ that ’s not it . ”
37896	37908	37843	37843	she	196	“ Why do n’t you cry again , you little wretch ? ”

38179	38184	38177	38177	he	4618	“ Yes , sir , ”

38210	38237	38239	38239	he	4618	“ Well ! Behave yourself . I have a pretty large experience of boys , and you ’re a bad set of fellows . Now mind ! ”
38254	38259	38239	38239	he	4618	“ you behave yourself ! ”
38380	38383	38384	38384	she	227	“ So ! ”
38393	38403	38384	38384	she	227	“ the days have worn away , have they ? ”
38404	38414	38428	38428	her	227	“ Yes , ma’am . To - day is — ”
38415	38422	38428	38428	her	227	“ There , there , there ! ”
38431	38445	38384	38384	she	227	“ I do n’t want to know . Are you ready to play ? ”
38455	38465	38446	38446	I	0	“ I do n’t think I am , ma’am . ”
38466	38472	38473	38473	she	227	“ Not at cards again ? ”
38481	38496	38473	38473	she	227	“ Yes , ma’am ; I could do that , if I was wanted . ”
38497	38509	38511	38512	Miss Havisham	227	“ Since this house strikes you old and grave , boy , ”
38516	38530	38511	38512	Miss Havisham	227	“ and you are unwilling to play , are you willing to work ? ”
38560	38568	38570	38570	she	227	“ Then go into that opposite room , ”
38583	38591	38570	38570	she	227	“ and wait there till I come . ”
38977	38980	38982	38982	she	227	“ This , ”
38993	39014	38982	38982	she	227	“ is where I will be laid when I am dead . They shall come and look at me here . ”
39051	39059	39060	39060	she	227	“ What do you think that is ? ”
39070	39078	39060	39060	she	227	“ that , where those cobwebs are ? ”
39079	39090	39067	39067	her	227	“ I ca n’t guess what it is , ma’am . ”
39091	39105	39106	39106	She	227	“ It ’s a great cake . A bride - cake . Mine ! ”

39282	39286	39279	39279	she	227	“ Call Estella ! ”
39413	39418	39420	39422	Miss Sarah Pocket	210	“ Dear Miss Havisham , ”
39424	39430	39420	39422	Miss Sarah Pocket	210	“ How well you look ! ”
39431	39436	39438	39439	Miss Havisham	227	“ I do not , ”
39441	39449	39450	39450	Camilla	208	“ I am yellow skin and bone . ”
39471	39491	39461	39461	she	227	“ Poor dear soul ! Certainly not to be expected to look well , poor thing . The idea ! ”
39492	39500	39502	39503	Miss Havisham	227	“ And how are _ you _ ? ”
39547	39554	39555	39555	she	227	“ Thank you , Miss Havisham , ”
39558	39568	39555	39555	she	227	“ I am as well as can be expected . ”
39569	39579	39581	39582	Miss Havisham	227	“ Why , what ’s the matter with you ? ”
39588	39593	39595	39595	Camilla	208	“ Nothing worth mentioning , ”
39597	39628	39595	39595	Camilla	208	“ I do n’t wish to make a display of my feelings , but I have habitually thought of you more in the night than I am quite equal to . ”
39629	39637	39639	39640	Miss Havisham	227	“ Then do n’t think of me , ”
39642	39647	39649	39649	Camilla	208	“ Very easily said ! ”
39670	39770	39666	39666	her	227	“ Raymond is a witness what ginger and sal volatile I am obliged to take in the night . Raymond is a witness what nervous jerkings I have in my legs . Chokings and nervous jerkings , however , are nothing new to me when I think with anxiety of those I love . If I could be less affectionate and sensitive , I should have a better digestion and an iron set of nerves . I am sure I wish it could be so . But as to not thinking of you in the night — The idea ! ”
39818	39850	39800	39800	He	209	“ Camilla , my dear , it is well known that your family feelings are gradually undermining you to the extent of making one of your legs shorter than the other . ”
39851	39857	39859	39861	the grave lady	1429	“ I am not aware , ”
39870	39890	39859	39861	the grave lady	1429	“ that to think of any person is to make a great claim upon that person , my dear . ”
39943	39953	39962	39964	the grave lady	1429	“ No , indeed , my dear . Hem ! ”
39954	39960	39962	39964	the grave lady	1429	“ Thinking is easy enough , ”
39966	39974	39962	39964	the grave lady	1429	“ What is easier , you know ? ”
39980	39987	39989	39989	Camilla	208	“ Oh , yes , yes ! ”
40004	40078	39989	39989	Camilla	208	“ It ’s all very true ! It ’s a weakness to be so affectionate , but I ca n’t help it . No doubt my health would be much better if it was otherwise , still I would n’t change my disposition if I could . It ’s the cause of much suffering , but it ’s a consolation to know I possess it , when I wake up in the night . ”
40125	40130	40132	40132	Camilla	208	“ There ’s Matthew ! ”
40134	40192	40132	40132	Camilla	208	“ Never mixing with any natural ties , never coming here to see how Miss Havisham is ! I have taken to the sofa with my staylace cut , and have lain there hours insensible , with my head over the side , and my hair all down , and my feet I do n’t know where — ”
40194	40204	40206	40207	Mr. Camilla	208	“ Much higher than your head , my love , ”
40210	40239	40132	40132	Camilla	208	“ I have gone off into that state , hours and hours , on account of Matthew ’s strange and inexplicable conduct , and nobody has thanked me . ”
40240	40250	40252	40254	the grave lady	1429	“ Really I must say I should think not ! ”
40256	40263	40265	40267	Miss Sarah Pocket	210	“ You see , my dear , ”
40275	40295	40265	40267	Miss Sarah Pocket	210	“ the question to put to yourself is , who did you expect to thank you , my love ? ”
40296	40308	40310	40310	Camilla	208	“ Without expecting any thanks , or anything of the sort , ”
40312	40385	40310	40310	Camilla	208	“ I have remained in that state , hours and hours , and Raymond is a witness of the extent to which I have choked , and what the total inefficacy of ginger has been , and I have been heard at the piano - forte tuner ’s across the street , where the poor mistaken children have even supposed it to be pigeons cooing at a distance,—and now to be told — ”
40447	40457	40459	40460	Miss Havisham	227	“ Matthew will come and see me at last , ”
40464	40479	40484	40484	her	227	“ when I am laid on that table . That will be his place,—there , ”
40487	40536	40544	40544	she	227	“ at my head ! And yours will be there ! And your husband ’s there ! And Sarah Pocket ’s there ! And Georgiana ’s there ! Now you all know where to take your stations when you come to feast upon me . And now go ! ”
40561	40568	40557	40557	She	227	“ Walk me , walk me ! ”
40575	40585	40587	40587	Camilla	208	“ I suppose there ’s nothing to be done , ”
40589	40691	40692	40693	Mr. Camilla	208	“ but comply and depart . It ’s something to have seen the object of one ’s love and duty for even so short a time . I shall think of it with a melancholy satisfaction when I wake up in the night . I wish Matthew could have that comfort , but he sets it at defiance . I am determined not to make a display of my feelings , but it ’s very hard to be told one wants to feast on one ’s relations,—as if one was a Giant,—and to be told to go . The bare idea ! ”

51397	51416	51385	51385	I	0	“ do n’t go on in that way . I never thought of making Miss Havisham any present . ”
51417	51422	51423	51423	Joe	158	“ No , Pip , ”
51438	51453	51428	51428	he	1670	“ and what I say to you is , you are right , Pip . ”
51454	51506	51385	51385	I	0	“ Yes , Joe ; but what I wanted to say , was , that as we are rather slack just now , if you would give me a half - holiday to - morrow , I think I would go uptown and make a call on Miss Est — Havisham . ”
51507	51512	51514	51514	Joe	158	“ Which her name , ”
51518	51531	51514	51514	Joe	158	“ ai n’t Estavisham , Pip , unless she have been rechris’ened . ”
51532	51557	51385	51385	I	0	“ I know , Joe , I know . It was a slip of mine . What do you think of it , Joe ? ”
52136	52171	52127	52127	he	0	“ Now , master ! Sure you ’re not a - going to favour only one of us . If Young Pip has a half - holiday , do as much for Old Orlick . ”
52194	52212	52214	52214	Joe	158	“ Why , what ’ll you do with a half - holiday , if you get it ? ”
52216	52247	52249	52249	Orlick	228	“ What ’ll _ I _ do with it ! What ’ll _ he _ do with it ? I ’ll do as much with it as _ him _ , ”
52251	52262	52264	52264	Joe	158	“ As to Pip , he ’s going up town , ”
52266	52285	52264	52264	Joe	158	“ Well then , as to Old Orlick , _ he _ ’s a - going up town , ”
52290	52306	52287	52288	that worthy	1690	“ Two can go up town . Tain’t only one wot can go up town . “
52313	52317	52310	52310	your	228	” said Joe . “
52323	52327	52328	52328	Some	1691	” growled Orlick . “
52349	52450	52453	52453	master	5014	” The master refusing to entertain the subject until the journeyman was in a better temper , Orlick plunged at the furnace , drew out a red - hot bar , made at me with it as if he were going to run it through my body , whisked it round my head , laid it on the anvil , hammered it out,—as if it were I , I thought , and the sparks were my spirting blood,—and finally said , when he had hammered himself hot and the iron cold , and he again leaned on his hammer , — “
52455	52456	52453	52453	master	5014	” “
52463	52467	52458	52458	you	5014	” demanded Joe . “
52475	52481	52470	52470	I	0	” said gruff Old Orlick . “
52498	52502	52487	52487	you	5014	” said Joe , “
52513	52543	52487	52487	you	5014	” My sister had been standing silent in the yard , within hearing,—she was a most unscrupulous spy and listener,—and she instantly looked in at one of the windows . “
52550	52556	52545	52545	you	5014	” said she to Joe , “
52592	52593	52583	52583	I	0	” “
52605	52617	52602	52602	you	5014	” retorted Orlick , with an ill - favoured grin . ( “
52622	52627	52602	52602	you	5014	” said Joe . ) “
52640	52654	52628	52628	I	0	” returned my sister , beginning to work herself into a mighty rage . “
52720	52721	52722	52722	You	5014	” “
52731	52736	52728	52729	Mother Gargery	233	” growled the journeyman . “
52752	52754	52749	52750	a good’un	1712	” ( “
52762	52767	52760	52760	you	5014	” said Joe . ) “
52773	52782	52770	52770	you	5014	” cried my sister , beginning to scream . “
52817	52888	52893	52893	he	1714	” Each of these exclamations was a shriek ; and I must remark of my sister , what is equally true of all the violent women I have ever seen , that passion was no excuse for her , because it is undeniable that instead of lapsing into passion , she consciously and deliberately took extraordinary pains to force herself into it , and became blindly furious by regular stages ; “
52913	52914	52893	52893	he	1714	” “
52921	52930	52893	52893	he	1714	” growled the journeyman , between his teeth , “
52957	52959	52960	52960	I	0	” ( “
52968	52973	52965	52965	her	4640	” said Joe . ) “
52980	53000	52978	52978	him	1714	” cried my sister , with a clap of her hands and a scream together,—which was her next stage . “
53034	53453	53458	53458	Pip	249	” Here my sister , after a fit of clappings and screamings , beat her hands upon her bosom and upon her knees , and threw her cap off , and pulled her hair down,—which were the last stages on her road to frenzy . Being by this time a perfect Fury and a complete success , she made a dash at the door which I had fortunately locked . What could the wretched Joe do now , after his disregarded parenthetical interruptions , but stand up to his journeyman , and ask him what he meant by interfering betwixt himself and Mrs. Joe ; and further whether he was man enough to come on ? Old Orlick felt that the situation admitted of nothing less than coming on , and was on his defence straightway ; so , without so much as pulling off their singed and burnt aprons , they went at one another , like two giants . But , if any man in that neighbourhood could stand uplong against Joe , I never saw the man . Orlick , as if he had been of no more account than the pale young gentleman , was very soon among the coal - dust , and in no hurry to come out of it . Then Joe unlocked the door and picked up my sister , who had dropped insensible at the window ( but who had seen the fight first , I think ) , and who was carried into the house and laid down , and who was recommended to revive , and would do nothing but struggle and clench her hands in Joe ’s hair . Then came that singular calm and silence which succeed all uproars ; and then , with the vague sensation which I have always connected with such a lull,—namely , that it was Sunday , and somebody was dead,—I went upstairs to dress myself . [ Illustration ] When I came down again , I found Joe and Orlick sweeping up , without any other traces of discomposure than a slit in one of Orlick ’s nostrils , which was neither expressive nor ornamental . A pot of beer had appeared from the Jolly Bargemen , and they were sharing it by turns in a peaceable manner . The lull had a sedative and philosophical influence on Joe , who followed me out into the road to say , as a parting observation that might do me good , “
53469	53573	53465	53465	Pip:—such	234	” With what absurd emotions ( for we think the feelings that are very serious in a man quite comical in a boy ) I found myself again going to Miss Havisham ’s , matters little here . Nor , how I passed and repassed the gate many times before I could make up my mind to ring . Nor , how I debated whether I should go away without ringing ; nor , how I should undoubtedly have gone , if my time had been my own , to come back . Miss Sarah Pocket came to the gate . No Estella . “
53582	53587	53578	53578	You	1721	” said Miss Pocket . “
53593	53644	53590	53590	you	1721	” When I said that I only came to see how Miss Havisham was , Sarah evidently deliberated whether or no she should send me about my business . But unwilling to hazard the responsibility , she let me in , and presently brought the sharp message that I was to “
53648	53659	53590	53590	you	1721	” Everything was unchanged , and Miss Havisham was alone . “
53662	53672	53590	53590	you	1721	” said she , fixing her eyes upon me . “
53684	53685	53689	53690	Miss Havisham	227	” “
53716	53717	53714	53714	you	1721	” “
53722	53729	53714	53714	you	1721	” with the old restless fingers . “
53740	53753	53754	53754	You	1721	” she cried suddenly , turning herself and her chair towards me , “
53763	53782	53759	53759	Estella	196	” I had been looking round,—in fact , for Estella,—and I stammered that I hoped she was well . “
53785	53790	53759	53759	Estella	196	” said Miss Havisham ; “
53821	54391	53813	53813	you	1721	” There was such a malignant enjoyment in her utterance of the last words , and she broke into such a disagreeable laugh , that I was at a loss what to say . She spared me the trouble of considering , by dismissing me . When the gate was closed upon me by Sarah of the walnut - shell countenance , I felt more than ever dissatisfied with my home and with my trade and with everything ; and that was all I took by _ that _ motion . As I was loitering along the High Street , looking in disconsolately at the shop windows , and thinking what I would buy if I were a gentleman , who should come out of the bookshop but Mr. Wopsle . Mr. Wopsle had in his hand the affecting tragedy of George Barnwell , in which he had that moment invested sixpence , with the view of heaping every word of it on the head of Pumblechook , with whom he was going to drink tea . No sooner did he see me , than he appeared to consider that a special Providence had put a ’ prentice in his way to be read at ; and he laid hold of me , and insisted on my accompanying him to the Pumblechookian parlour . As I knew it would be miserable at home , and as the nights were dark and the way was dreary , and almost any companionship on the road was better than none , I made no great resistance ; consequently , we turned into Pumblechook ’s just as the street and the shops were lighting up . As I never assisted at any other representation of George Barnwell , I do n’t know how long it may usually take ; but I know very well that it took until half - past nine o ’ clock that night , and that when Mr. Wopsle got into Newgate , I thought he never would go to the scaffold , he became so much slower than at any former period of his disgraceful career . I thought it a little too much that he should complain of being cut short in his flower after all , as if he had not been running to seed , leaf after leaf , ever since his course began . This , however , was a mere question of length and wearisomeness . What stung me , was the identification of the whole affair with my unoffending self . When Barnwell began to go wrong , I declare that I felt positively apologetic , Pumblechook ’s indignant stare so taxed me with it . Wopsle , too , took pains to present me in the worst light . At once ferocious and maudlin , I was made to murder my uncle with no extenuating circumstances whatever ; Millwood put me down in argument , on every occasion ; it became sheer monomania in my master ’s daughter to care a button for me ; and all I can say for my gasping and procrastinating conduct on the fatal morning , is , that it was worthy of the general feebleness of my character . Even after I was happily hanged and Wopsle had closed the book , Pumblechook sat staring at me , and shaking his head , and saying , “
54400	54543	54544	54544	Halloa	164	” as if it were a well - known fact that I contemplated murdering a near relation , provided I could only induce one to have the weakness to become my benefactor . It was a very dark night when it was all over , and when I set out with Mr. Wopsle on the walk home . Beyond town , we found a heavy mist out , and it fell wet and thick . The turnpike lamp was a blur , quite out of the lamp ’s usual place apparently , and its rays looked solid substance on the fog . We were noticing this , and saying how that the mist rose with a change of wind from a certain quarter of our marshes , when we came upon a man , slouching under the lee of the turnpike house . “
54546	54552	54544	54544	Halloa	164	” we said , stopping . “
54556	54557	54553	54553	Orlick	228	” “
54560	54567	54553	54553	Orlick	228	” he answered , slouching out . “
54581	54582	54583	54583	You	228	” “
54587	54596	54583	54583	You	228	” I remarked . Orlick not unnaturally answered , “
54604	54605	54606	54606	We	1725	” “
54610	54619	54583	54583	You	228	” said Mr. Wopsle , exalted with his late performance,—“we
54632	54672	54624	54625	Mr. Orlick	238	” Old Orlick growled , as if he had nothing to say about that , and we all went on together . I asked him presently whether he had been spending his half - holiday up and down town ? “
54675	54679	54624	54625	Mr. Orlick	238	” said he , “
54716	54717	54697	54697	I	0	” “
54722	54725	54697	54697	I	0	” said I. “
54755	54804	54749	54749	You	1726	” In effect , we had not walked many yards further , when the well - remembered boom came towards us , deadened by the mist , and heavily rolled away along the low grounds by the river , as if it were pursuing and threatening the fugitives . “
54813	54817	54749	54749	You	1726	” said Orlick . “
54838	54974	54982	54982	Clem	218	” The subject was a suggestive one to me , and I thought about it in silence . Mr. Wopsle , as the ill - requited uncle of the evening ’s tragedy , fell to meditating aloud in his garden at Camberwell . Orlick , with his hands in his pockets , slouched heavily at my side . It was very dark , very wet , very muddy , and so we splashed along . Now and then , the sound of the signal cannon broke upon us again , and again rolled sulkily along the course of the river . I kept myself to myself and my thoughts . Mr. Wopsle died amiably at Camberwell , and exceedingly game on Bosworth Field , and in the greatest agonies at Glastonbury . Orlick sometimes growled , “
54992	55097	54982	54982	Clem	218	” I thought he had been drinking , but he was not drunk . Thus , we came to the village . The way by which we approached it took us past the Three Jolly Bargemen , which we were surprised to find — it being eleven o’clock — in a state of commotion , with the door wide open , and unwonted lights that had been hastily caught up and put down scattered about . Mr. Wopsle dropped in to ask what was the matter ( surmising that a convict had been taken ) , but came running out in a great hurry . “
55103	55110	54982	54982	Clem	218	” said he , without stopping , “
55121	55122	55116	55116	Pip	249	” “
55127	55144	55145	55145	I	0	” I asked , keeping up with him . So did Orlick , at my side . “
55176	56845	55169	55169	Somebody	635	” We were running too fast to admit of more being said , and we made no stop until we got into our kitchen . It was full of people ; the whole village was there , or in the yard ; and there was a surgeon , and there was Joe , and there were a group of women , all on the floor in the midst of the kitchen . The unemployed bystanders drew back when they saw me , and so I became aware of my sister,—lying without sense or movement on the bare boards where she had been knocked down by a tremendous blow on the back of the head , dealt by some unknown hand when her face was turned towards the fire,—destined never to be on the Rampage again , while she was the wife of Joe . Chapter XVI . With my head full of George Barnwell , I was at first disposed to believe that _ I _ must have had some hand in the attack upon my sister , or at all events that as her near relation , popularly known to be under obligations to her , I was a more legitimate object of suspicion than any one else . But when , in the clearer light of next morning , I began to reconsider the matter and to hear it discussed around me on all sides , I took another view of the case , which was more reasonable . Joe had been at the Three Jolly Bargemen , smoking his pipe , from a quarter after eight o’clock to a quarter before ten . While he was there , my sister had been seen standing at the kitchen door , and had exchanged Good Night with a farm - labourer going home . The man could not be more particular as to the time at which he saw her ( he got into dense confusion when he tried to be ) , than that it must have been before nine . When Joe went home at five minutes before ten , he found her struck down on the floor , and promptly called in assistance . The fire had not then burnt unusually low , nor was the snuff of the candle very long ; the candle , however , had been blown out . Nothing had been taken away from any part of the house . Neither , beyond the blowing out of the candle,—which stood on a table between the door and my sister , and was behind her when she stood facing the fire and was struck,—was there any disarrangement of the kitchen , excepting such as she herself had made , in falling and bleeding . But , there was one remarkable piece of evidence on the spot . She had been struck with something blunt and heavy , on the head and spine ; after the blows were dealt , something heavy had been thrown down at her with considerable violence , as she lay on her face . And on the ground beside her , when Joe picked her up , was a convict ’s leg - iron which had been filed asunder . Now , Joe , examining this iron with a smith ’s eye , declared it to have been filed asunder some time ago . The hue and cry going off to the Hulks , and people coming thence to examine the iron , Joe ’s opinion was corroborated . They did not undertake to say when it had left the prison - ships to which it undoubtedly had once belonged ; but they claimed to know for certain that that particular manacle had not been worn by either of the two convicts who had escaped last night . Further , one of those two was already retaken , and had not freed himself of his iron . Knowing what I knew , I set up an inference of my own here . I believed the iron to be my convict ’s iron,—the iron I had seen and heard him filing at , on the marshes,—but my mind did not accuse him of having put it to its latest use . For I believed one of two other persons to have become possessed of it , and to have turned it to this cruel account . Either Orlick , or the strange man who had shown me the file . Now , as to Orlick ; he had gone to town exactly as he told us when we picked him up at the turnpike , he had been seen about town all the evening , he had been in divers companies in several public - houses , and he had come back with myself and Mr. Wopsle . There was nothing against him , save the quarrel ; and my sister had quarrelled with him , and with everybody else about her , ten thousand times . As to the strange man ; if he had come back for his two bank - notes there could have been no dispute about them , because my sister was fully prepared to restore them . Besides , there had been no altercation ; the assailant had come in so silently and suddenly , that she had been felled before she could look round . It was horrible to think that I had provided the weapon , however undesignedly , but I could hardly think otherwise . I suffered unspeakable trouble while I considered and reconsidered whether I should at last dissolve that spell of my childhood and tell Joe all the story . For months afterwards , I every day settled the question finally in the negative , and reopened and reargued it next morning . The contention came , after all , to this;—the secret was such an old one now , had so grown into me and become a part of myself , that I could not tear it away . In addition to the dread that , having led up to so much mischief , it would be now more likely than ever to alienate Joe from me if he believed it , I had a further restraining dread that he would not believe it , but would assort it with the fabulous dogs and veal - cutlets as a monstrous invention . However , I temporized with myself , of course — for , was I not wavering between right and wrong , when the thing is always done?—and resolved to make a full disclosure if I should see any such new occasion as a new chance of helping in the discovery of the assailant . The Constables and the Bow Street men from London — for , this happened in the days of the extinct red - waistcoated police — were about the house for a week or two , and did pretty much what I have heard and read of like authorities doing in other such cases . They took up several obviously wrong people , and they ran their heads very hard against wrong ideas , and persisted in trying to fit the circumstances to the ideas , instead of trying to extract ideas from the circumstances . Also , they stood about the door of the Jolly Bargemen , with knowing and reserved looks that filled the whole neighbourhood with admiration ; and they had a mysterious manner of taking their drink , that was almost as good as taking the culprit . But not quite , for they never did it . Long after these constitutional powers had dispersed , my sister lay very ill in bed . Her sight was disturbed , so that she saw objects multiplied , and grasped at visionary teacups and wineglasses instead of the realities ; her hearing was greatly impaired ; her memory also ; and her speech was unintelligible . When , at last , she came round so far as to be helped downstairs , it was still necessary to keep my slate always by her , that she might indicate in writing what she could not indicate in speech . As she was ( very bad handwriting apart ) a more than indifferent speller , and as Joe was a more than indifferent reader , extraordinary complications arose between them which I was always called in to solve . The administration of mutton instead of medicine , the substitution of Tea for Joe , and the baker for bacon , were among the mildest of my own mistakes . However , her temper was greatly improved , and she was patient . A tremulous uncertainty of the action of all her limbs soon became a part of her regular state , and afterwards , at intervals of two or three months , she would often put her hands to her head , and would then remain for about a week at a time in some gloomy aberration of mind . We were at a loss to find a suitable attendant for her , until a circumstance happened conveniently to relieve us . Mr. Wopsle ’s great - aunt conquered a confirmed habit of living into which she had fallen , and Biddy became a part of our establishment . It may have been about a month after my sister ’s reappearance in the kitchen , when Biddy came to us with a small speckled box containing the whole of her worldly effects , and became a blessing to the household . Above all , she was a blessing to Joe , for the dear old fellow was sadly cut up by the constant contemplation of the wreck of his wife , and had been accustomed , while attending on her of an evening , to turn to me every now and then and say , with his blue eyes moistened , “
56860	57252	56858	56858	Pip	249	” Biddy instantly taking the cleverest charge of her as though she had studied her from infancy ; Joe became able in some sort to appreciate the greater quiet of his life , and to get down to the Jolly Bargemen now and then for a change that did him good . It was characteristic of the police people that they had all more or less suspected poor Joe ( though he never knew it ) , and that they had to a man concurred in regarding him as one of the deepest spirits they had ever encountered . Biddy ’s first triumph in her new office , was to solve a difficulty that had completely vanquished me . I had tried hard at it , but had made nothing of it . Thus it was : — Again and again and again , my sister had traced upon the slate , a character that looked like a curious T , and then with the utmost eagerness had called our attention to it as something she particularly wanted . I had in vain tried everything producible that began with a T , from tar to toast and tub . At length it had come into my head that the sign looked like a hammer , and on my lustily calling that word in my sister ’s ear , she had begun to hammer on the table and had expressed a qualified assent . Thereupon , I had brought in all our hammers , one after another , but without avail . Then I bethought me of a crutch , the shape being much the same , and I borrowed one in the village , and displayed it to my sister with considerable confidence . But she shook her head to that extent when she was shown it , that we were terrified lest in her weak and shattered state she should dislocate her neck . When my sister found that Biddy was very quick to understand her , this mysterious sign reappeared on the slate . Biddy looked thoughtfully at it , heard my explanation , looked thoughtfully at my sister , looked thoughtfully at Joe ( who was always represented on the slate by his initial letter ) , and ran into the forge , followed by Joe and me . “
57258	57267	56858	56858	Pip	249	” cried Biddy , with an exultant face . “
57279	57972	57973	57973	Biddy	186	” Orlick , without a doubt ! She had lost his name , and could only signify him by his hammer . We told him why we wanted him to come into the kitchen , and he slowly laid down his hammer , wiped his brow with his arm , took another wipe at it with his apron , and came slouching out , with a curious loose vagabond bend in the knees that strongly distinguished him . I confess that I expected to see my sister denounce him , and that I was disappointed by the different result . She manifested the greatest anxiety to be on good terms with him , was evidently much pleased by his being at length produced , and motioned that she would have him given something to drink . She watched his countenance as if she were particularly wishful to be assured that he took kindly to his reception , she showed every possible desire to conciliate him , and there was an air of humble propitiation in all she did , such as I have seen pervade the bearing of a child towards a hard master . After that day , a day rarely passed without her drawing the hammer on her slate , and without Orlick ’s slouching in and standing doggedly before her , as if he knew no more than I did what to make of it . Chapter XVII . I now fell into a regular routine of apprenticeship life , which was varied beyond the limits of the village and the marshes , by no more remarkable circumstance than the arrival of my birthday and my paying another visit to Miss Havisham . I found Miss Sarah Pocket still on duty at the gate ; I found Miss Havisham just as I had left her , and she spoke of Estella in the very same way , if not in the very same words . The interview lasted but a few minutes , and she gave me a guinea when I was going , and told me to come again on my next birthday . I may mention at once that this became an annual custom . I tried to decline taking the guinea on the first occasion , but with no better effect than causing her to ask me very angrily , if I expected more ? Then , and after that , I took it . So unchanging was the dull old house , the yellow light in the darkened room , the faded spectre in the chair by the dressing - table glass , that I felt as if the stopping of the clocks had stopped Time in that mysterious place , and , while I and everything else outside it grew older , it stood still . Daylight never entered the house as to my thoughts and remembrances of it , any more than as to the actual fact . It bewildered me , and under its influence I continued at heart to hate my trade and to be ashamed of home . Imperceptibly I became conscious of a change in Biddy , however . Her shoes came up at the heel , her hair grew bright and neat , her hands were always clean . She was not beautiful,—she was common , and could not be like Estella,—but she was pleasant and wholesome and sweet - tempered . She had not been with us more than a year ( I remember her being newly out of mourning at the time it struck me ) , when I observed to myself one evening that she had curiously thoughtful and attentive eyes ; eyes that were very pretty and very good . It came of my lifting up my own eyes from a task I was poring at — writing some passages from a book , to improve myself in two ways at once by a sort of stratagem — and seeing Biddy observant of what I was about . I laid down my pen , and Biddy stopped in her needlework without laying it down . “
57975	57979	57982	57982	you	186	” said I , “
57998	57999	57993	57993	you	186	” “
58012	58046	58007	58007	I	0	” returned Biddy , smiling . She managed our whole domestic life , and wonderfully too ; but I did not mean that , though that made what I did mean more surprising . “
58054	58058	58049	58049	you	186	” said I , “
58074	58130	58131	58131	I	0	” I was beginning to be rather vain of my knowledge , for I spent my birthday guineas on it , and set aside the greater part of my pocket - money for similar investment ; though I have no doubt , now , that the little I knew was extremely dear at the price . “
58138	58142	58145	58145	you	186	” said Biddy , “
58149	58150	58145	58145	you	186	” “
58185	58186	58176	58176	you	186	” “
58197	58304	58189	58189	I	0	” said Biddy , quietly ; and went on with her sewing . Pursuing my idea as I leaned back in my wooden chair , and looked at Biddy sewing away with her head on one side , I began to think her rather an extraordinary girl . For I called to mind now , that she was equally accomplished in the terms of our trade , and the names of our different sorts of work , and our various tools . In short , whatever I knew , Biddy knew . Theoretically , she was already as good a blacksmith as I , or better . “
58313	58317	58311	58311	Biddy	186	” said I , “
58343	58359	58326	58326	You	1738	” Biddy looked at me for an instant , and went on with her sewing . “
58371	58379	58380	58380	Biddy	186	” said she , as she sewed . “
58382	58389	58380	58380	Biddy	186	” I exclaimed , in amazement . “
58396	58397	58392	58392	you	186	” “
58403	58412	58392	58392	you	186	” said Biddy , looking up and laughing . “
58420	58627	58630	58630	Biddy	186	” What could have put it in my head but the glistening of a tear as it dropped on her work ? I sat silent , recalling what a drudge she had been until Mr. Wopsle ’s great - aunt successfully overcame that bad habit of living , so highly desirable to be got rid of by some people . I recalled the hopeless circumstances by which she had been surrounded in the miserable little shop and the miserable little noisy evening school , with that miserable old bundle of incompetence always to be dragged and shouldered . I reflected that even in those untoward times there must have been latent in Biddy what was now developing , for , in my first uneasiness and discontent I had turned to her for help , as a matter of course . Biddy sat quietly sewing , shedding no more tears , and while I looked at her and thought about it all , it occurred to me that perhaps I had not been sufficiently grateful to Biddy . I might have been too reserved , and should have patronised her more ( though I did not use that precise word in my meditations ) with my confidence . “
58632	58644	58645	58645	you	186	” I observed , when I had done turning it over , “
58671	58672	58645	58645	you	186	” “
58678	58712	58645	58645	you	186	” replied Biddy . It was like her self - forgetfulness to transfer the remark to my sister , and to get up and be busy about her , making her more comfortable ; “
58718	58719	58645	58645	you	186	” “
58722	58726	58645	58645	you	186	” said I , “
58775	58924	58925	58925	Biddy	186	” My sister was never left alone now ; but Joe more than readily undertook the care of her on that Sunday afternoon , and Biddy and I went out together . It was summer - time , and lovely weather . When we had passed the village and the church and the churchyard , and were out on the marshes and began to see the sails of the ships as they sailed on , I began to combine Miss Havisham and Estella with the prospect , in my usual way . When we came to the river - side and sat down on the bank , with the water rippling at our feet , making it all more quiet than it would have been without that sound , I resolved that it was a good time and place for the admission of Biddy into my inner confidence . “
58927	58937	58925	58925	Biddy	186	” said I , after binding her to secrecy , “
58945	58946	58938	58938	I	0	” “
58958	58962	58963	58963	I	0	” she returned . “
58971	58972	58973	58973	Biddy	186	” “
58975	58983	58973	58973	Biddy	186	” said I , with some severity , “
58995	58996	58997	58997	You	0	” “
59015	59016	59017	59017	Biddy	186	” “
59019	59025	59017	59017	Biddy	186	” I exclaimed , impatiently , “
59064	59065	59067	59067	I	0	” “
59070	59079	59067	59067	I	0	” said Biddy , quietly raising her eyebrows ; “
59106	59107	59093	59093	I	0	” “
59149	59150	59132	59132	Biddy!—unless	1746	” “
59156	59245	59132	59132	Biddy!—unless	1746	” said Biddy , shaking her head with a sorrowful air . Now , I too had so often thought it a pity , that , in the singular kind of quarrel with myself which I was always carrying on , I was half inclined to shed tears of vexation and distress when Biddy gave utterance to her sentiment and my own . I told her she was right , and I knew it was much to be regretted , but still it was not to be helped . “
59253	59288	59289	59289	I	0	” I said to Biddy , plucking up the short grass within reach , much as I had once upon a time pulled my feelings out of my hair and kicked them into the brewery wall,—“if
59398	59415	59418	59418	I	0	” Biddy sighed as she looked at the ships sailing on , and returned for answer , “
59425	59438	59418	59418	I	0	” It scarcely sounded flattering , but I knew she meant well . “
59443	59458	59466	59466	Dissatisfied	241	” said I , plucking up more grass and chewing a blade or two , “
59492	59517	59486	59486	nobody	571	” Biddy turned her face suddenly towards mine , and looked far more attentively at me than she had looked at the sailing ships . “
59532	59544	59486	59486	nobody	571	” she remarked , directing her eyes to the ships again . “
59549	59583	59584	59591	The beautiful young lady at Miss Havisham ’s	1751	” I was disconcerted , for I had broken away without quite seeing where I was going to . It was not to be shuffled off now , however , and I answered , “
59620	59650	59610	59610	I	0	” Having made this lunatic confession , I began to throw my torn - up grass into the river , as if I had some thoughts of following it . “
59668	59678	59652	59652	you	0	” Biddy quietly asked me , after a pause . “
59684	59689	59679	59679	I	0	” I moodily answered . “
59699	59703	59704	59704	I	0	” Biddy pursued , “
59753	59802	59742	59742	you	0	” Exactly what I myself had thought , many times . Exactly what was perfectly manifest to me at the moment . But how could I , a poor dazed village lad , avoid that wonderful inconsistency into which the best and wisest of men fall every day ? “
59810	59816	59742	59742	you	0	” said I to Biddy , “
59823	60018	59818	59818	I	0	” In short , I turned over on my face when I came to that , and got a good grasp on the hair on each side of my head , and wrenched it well . All the while knowing the madness of my heart to be so very mad and misplaced , that I was quite conscious it would have served my face right , if I had lifted it up by my hair , and knocked it against the pebbles as a punishment for belonging to such an idiot . Biddy was the wisest of girls , and she tried to reason no more with me . She put her hand , which was a comfortable hand though roughened by work , upon my hands , one after another , and gently took them out of my hair . Then she softly patted my shoulder in a soothing way , while with my face upon my sleeve I cried a little,—exactly as I had done in the brewery yard,—and felt vaguely convinced that I was very much ill - used by somebody , or by everybody ; I ca n’t say which . “
60026	60030	60036	60036	you	1755	” said Biddy , “
60146	60174	60111	60111	she	1759	” So , with a quiet sigh for me , Biddy rose from the bank , and said , with a fresh and pleasant change of voice , “
60186	60187	60188	60188	Biddy	186	” “
60190	60210	60188	60188	Biddy	186	” I cried , getting up , putting my arm round her neck , and giving her a kiss , “
60218	60219	60211	60211	I	0	” “
60226	60230	60221	60221	you	1755	” said Biddy . “
60269	60270	60260	60260	I	0	” “
60273	60300	60260	60260	I	0	” said Biddy , quite in a whisper , as she looked away at the ships . And then repeated , with her former pleasant change , “
60312	60495	60496	60496	Pip	249	” I said to Biddy we would walk a little farther , and we did so , and the summer afternoon toned down into the summer evening , and it was very beautiful . I began to consider whether I was not more naturally and wholesomely situated , after all , in these circumstances , than playing beggar my neighbour by candle - light in the room with the stopped clocks , and being despised by Estella . I thought it would be very good for me if I could get her out of my head , with all the rest of those remembrances and fancies , and could go to work determined to relish what I had to do , and stick to it , and make the best of it . I asked myself the question whether I did not surely know that if Estella were beside me at that moment instead of Biddy , she would make me miserable ? I was obliged to admit that I did know it for a certainty , and I said to myself , “
60504	60590	60496	60496	Pip	249	” We talked a good deal as we walked , and all that Biddy said seemed right . Biddy was never insulting , or capricious , or Biddy to - day and somebody else to - morrow ; she would have derived only pain , and no pleasure , from giving me pain ; she would far rather have wounded her own breast than mine . How could it be , then , that I did not like her much the better of the two ? “
60593	60603	60591	60591	Biddy	186	” said I , when we were walking homeward , “
60612	60613	60606	60606	you	186	” “
60619	60623	60614	60614	I	0	” said Biddy . “
60649	60650	60635	60635	you,—you	186	” “
60658	60662	60635	60635	you,—you	186	” said Biddy . “
60668	60669	60635	60635	you,—you	186	” “
60690	60691	60635	60635	you,—you	186	” “
60700	60841	60842	60842	Halloa	164	” said Biddy . It did not appear quite so unlikely to me that evening , as it would have done if we had discussed it a few hours before . I therefore observed I was not quite sure of that . But Biddy said she _ was _ , and she said it decisively . In my heart I believed her to be right ; and yet I took it rather ill , too , that she should be so positive on the point . When we came near the churchyard , we had to cross an embankment , and get over a stile near a sluice - gate . There started up , from the gate , or from the rushes , or from the ooze ( which was quite in his stagnant way ) , Old Orlick . “
60844	60848	60842	60842	Halloa	164	” he growled , “
60855	60856	60851	60851	you	1768	” “
60866	60867	60842	60842	Halloa	164	” “
60872	60876	60842	60842	Halloa	164	” said he , “
60888	60988	60881	60881	I	0	” This penalty of being jiggered was a favourite supposititious case of his . He attached no definite meaning to the word that I am aware of , but used it , like his own pretended Christian name , to affront mankind , and convey an idea of something savagely damaging . When I was younger , I had had a general belief that if he had jiggered me personally , he would have done it with a sharp and twisted hook . Biddy was much against his going with us , and said to me in a whisper , “
61001	61094	60995	60995	I	0	” As I did not like him either , I took the liberty of saying that we thanked him , but we did n’t want seeing home . He received that piece of information with a yell of laughter , and dropped back , but came slouching after us at a little distance . Curious to know whether Biddy suspected him of having had a hand in that murderous attack of which my sister had never been able to give any account , I asked her why she did not like him . “
61097	61111	60995	60995	I	0	” she replied , glancing over her shoulder as he slouched after us , “
61122	61123	61118	61118	he	1771	” “
61133	61138	61125	61125	he	1771	” I asked indignantly . “
61141	61151	61152	61152	he	1771	” said Biddy , glancing over her shoulder again , “
61171	61216	61159	61159	he	1771	” However novel and peculiar this testimony of attachment , I did not doubt the accuracy of the interpretation . I was very hot indeed upon Old Orlick ’s daring to admire her ; as hot as if it were an outrage on myself . “
61228	61234	61225	61225	you	0	” said Biddy , calmly . “
61260	61261	61253	61253	I	0	” “
61266	61270	61263	61263	I	0	” said Biddy . “
61281	61282	61263	61263	I	0	” “
61285	61289	61263	61263	I	0	” said I ; “
61315	61724	61306	61306	he	1772	” I kept an eye on Orlick after that night , and , whenever circumstances were favourable to his dancing at Biddy , got before him to obscure that demonstration . He had struck root in Joe ’s establishment , by reason of my sister ’s sudden fancy for him , or I should have tried to get him dismissed . He quite understood and reciprocated my good intentions , as I had reason to know thereafter . And now , because my mind was not confused enough before , I complicated its confusion fifty thousand - fold , by having states and seasons when I was clear that Biddy was immeasurably better than Estella , and that the plain honest working life to which I was born had nothing in it to be ashamed of , but offered me sufficient means of self - respect and happiness . At those times , I would decide conclusively that my disaffection to dear old Joe and the forge was gone , and that I was growing up in a fair way to be partners with Joe and to keep company with Biddy,—when all in a moment some confounding remembrance of the Havisham days would fall upon me like a destructive missile , and scatter my wits again . Scattered wits take a long time picking up ; and often before I had got them well together , they would be dispersed in all directions by one stray thought , that perhaps after all Miss Havisham was going to make my fortune when my time was out . If my time had run out , it would have left me still at the height of my perplexities , I dare say . It never did run out , however , but was brought to a premature end , as I proceed to relate . Chapter XVIII . It was in the fourth year of my apprenticeship to Joe , and it was a Saturday night . There was a group assembled round the fire at the Three Jolly Bargemen , attentive to Mr. Wopsle as he read the newspaper aloud . Of that group I was one . A highly popular murder had been committed , and Mr. Wopsle was imbrued in blood to the eyebrows . He gloated over every abhorrent adjective in the description , and identified himself with every witness at the Inquest . He faintly moaned , “
61730	61740	61725	61725	I	0	” as the victim , and he barbarously bellowed , “
61747	61904	61741	61741	I	0	” as the murderer . He gave the medical testimony , in pointed imitation of our local practitioner ; and he piped and shook , as the aged turnpike - keeper who had heard blows , to an extent so very paralytic as to suggest a doubt regarding the mental competency of that witness . The coroner , in Mr. Wopsle ’s hands , became Timon of Athens ; the beadle , Coriolanus . He enjoyed himself thoroughly , and we all enjoyed ourselves , and were delightfully comfortable . In this cosey state of mind we came to the verdict Wilful Murder . Then , and not sooner , I became aware of a strange gentleman leaning over the back of the settle opposite me , looking on . There was an expression of contempt on his face , and he bit the side of a great forefinger as he watched the group of faces . “
61907	61921	61922	61922	you	1774	” said the stranger to Mr. Wopsle , when the reading was done , “
61937	61959	61922	61922	you	1774	” Everybody started and looked up , as if it were the murderer . He looked at everybody coldly and sarcastically . “
61965	61969	61922	61922	you	1774	” said he . “
61976	61977	61978	61978	Sir	4442	” “
61980	61985	61978	61978	Sir	4442	” returned Mr. Wopsle , “
61999	62013	61994	61994	I	0	” Upon this we all took courage to unite in a confirmatory murmur . “
62019	62024	62016	62016	you	1774	” said the stranger ; “
62077	62078	62079	62079	Sir	4442	” “
62081	62088	62090	62091	an Englishman	1778	” Mr. Wopsle began to reply , “
62096	62097	62094	62094	I	0	” “
62100	62111	62094	62094	I	0	” said the stranger , biting his forefinger at him . “
62136	62178	62220	62220	you	1774	” He stood with his head on one side and himself on one side , in a bullying , interrogative manner , and he threw his forefinger at Mr. Wopsle,—as it were to mark him out — before biting it again . “
62181	62185	62187	62187	you	1774	” said he . “
62198	62199	62194	62194	you	1774	” “
62205	62210	62201	62201	I	0	” replied Mr. Wopsle . “
62233	62246	62201	62201	I	0	question,”—taking possession of Mr. Wopsle , as if he had a right to him,—“_do
62262	62268	62269	62269	I	0	” Mr. Wopsle was beginning , “
62274	62281	62269	62269	I	0	” when the stranger stopped him . “
62303	62311	62297	62297	I	0	” Throwing his finger at him again . “
62353	62371	62392	62392	I	0	” Mr. Wopsle hesitated , and we all began to conceive rather a poor opinion of him . “
62374	62379	62380	62380	I	0	” said the stranger , “
62411	62412	62392	62392	I	0	” “
62417	62430	62392	62392	I	0	” repeated Mr. Wopsle , eyeing it , much at a loss . “
62434	62446	62392	62392	I	0	” pursued the stranger in his most sarcastic and suspicious manner , “
62457	62458	62392	62392	I	0	” “
62461	62462	62392	62392	I	0	” “
62496	62497	62498	62498	I	0	” “
62504	62509	62498	62498	I	0	” Mr. Wopsle pleaded . “
62589	62603	62607	62607	you	0	” ( We all began to think Mr. Wopsle full of subterfuge . ) “
62611	62612	62607	62607	you	0	” “
62617	62622	62607	62607	you	0	” said Mr. Wopsle . “
62667	62672	62661	62661	you	0	” Mr. Wopsle answered , “
62680	62681	62661	62661	you	0	” “
62687	62693	62661	62661	you	0	” repeated the gentleman bitterly . “
62700	62701	62661	62661	you	0	” “
62704	62709	62661	62661	you	0	” said Mr. Wopsle . “
62712	62736	62661	62661	you	0	” repeated the stranger , looking round at the rest of the company with his right hand extended towards the witness , Wopsle . “
62778	62806	62808	62810	that same man	1790	” We all began to suspect that Mr. Wopsle was not the man we had thought him , and that he was beginning to be found out . “
62814	62825	62808	62810	that same man	1790	” pursued the gentleman , throwing his finger at Mr. Wopsle heavily,—“that
62905	63020	62903	62903	God	180	” We were all deeply persuaded that the unfortunate Wopsle had gone too far , and had better stop in his reckless career while there was yet time . The strange gentleman , with an air of authority not to be disputed , and with a manner expressive of knowing something secret about every one of us that would effectually do for each individual if he chose to disclose it , left the back of the settle , and came into the space between the two settles , in front of the fire , where he remained standing , his left hand in his pocket , and he biting the forefinger of his right . “
63027	63042	62903	62903	God	180	” said he , looking round at us as we all quailed before him , “
63069	63070	63066	63067	the man	467	” “
63076	63094	63073	63074	the man	467	” said Joe . The strange gentleman beckoned him out of his place , and Joe went . “
63100	63105	63073	63074	the man	467	” pursued the stranger , “
63115	63116	63112	63112	he	1802	” “
63121	63237	63117	63117	I	0	” I cried . The stranger did not recognise me , but I recognised him as the gentleman I had met on the stairs , on the occasion of my second visit to Miss Havisham . I had known him the moment I saw him looking over the settle , and now that I stood confronting him with his hand upon my shoulder , I checked off again in detail his large head , his dark complexion , his deep - set eyes , his bushy black eyebrows , his large watch - chain , his strong black dots of beard and whisker , and even the smell of scented soap on his great hand . “
63249	63262	63238	63238	I	0	” said he , when he had surveyed me at his leisure . “
63316	63467	63308	63308	I	0	” Amidst a wondering silence , we three walked out of the Jolly Bargemen , and in a wondering silence walked home . While going along , the strange gentleman occasionally looked at me , and occasionally bit the side of his finger . As we neared home , Joe vaguely acknowledging the occasion as an impressive and ceremonious one , went on ahead to open the front door . Our conference was held in the state parlour , which was feebly lighted by one candle . It began with the strange gentleman ’s sitting down at the table , drawing the candle to him , and looking over some entries in his pocket - book . He then put up the pocket - book and set the candle a little aside , after peering round it into the darkness at Joe and me , to ascertain which was which . “
63471	63475	63477	63477	Jaggers	245	” he said , “
63561	63613	63552	63552	I	0	” Finding that he could not see us very well from where he sat , he got up , and threw one leg over the back of a chair and leaned upon it ; thus having one foot on the seat of the chair , and one foot on the ground . “
63660	63661	63662	63662	Lord	1814	” “
63677	63683	63662	63662	Lord	1814	” said Joe , staring . “
63695	63700	63662	63662	Lord	1814	” returned Mr. Jaggers . “
63715	63716	63711	63711	you	0	” “
63721	63727	63711	63711	you	0	” returned Joe , sternly , “
63730	63768	63711	63711	you	0	” I thought Mr. Jaggers glanced at Joe , as if he considered him a fool for his disinterestedness . But I was too much bewildered between breathless curiosity and surprise , to be sure of it . “
63772	63777	63711	63711	you	0	” said Mr. Jaggers . “
63795	63796	63835	63835	Bear	246	” “
63805	63809	63810	63810	I	0	” retorted Joe . “
63823	63824	63818	63818	you	0	” “
63833	63834	63835	63835	Bear	246	” “
63861	63884	63859	63859	you	0	” repeated Mr. Jaggers , shutting his eyes and nodding his head at Joe , as if he were forgiving him something . “
63910	63922	63923	63923	I	0	” Joe and I gasped , and looked at one another . “
63931	63943	63923	63923	I	0	” said Mr. Jaggers , throwing his finger at me sideways , “
64002	64030	63989	63990	a gentleman,—in	1820	” My dream was out ; my wild fancy was surpassed by sober reality ; Miss Havisham was going to make my fortune on a grand scale . “
64036	64041	64042	64042	I	0	” pursued the lawyer , “
64122	64150	64151	64151	I	0	” My heart was beating so fast , and there was such a singing in my ears , that I could scarcely stammer I had no objection . “
64463	64477	64478	64478	I	0	” Once more , I stammered with difficulty that I had no objection . “
64494	64567	64568	64568	We	1834	” Though he called me Mr. Pip , and began rather to make up to me , he still could not get rid of a certain air of bullying suspicion ; and even now he occasionally shut his eyes and threw his finger at me while he spoke , as much as to express that he knew all kinds of things to my disparagement , if he only chose to mention them . “
64634	64643	64644	64644	I	0	” for I was going to thank him , “
64700	64710	64720	64721	Mr. Pip	249	” I said I had always longed for it . “
64723	64727	64720	64721	Mr. Pip	249	” he retorted ; “
64765	64774	64745	64745	I	0	” I stammered yes , that was it . “
64815	64841	64806	64813	any tutor whom you would prefer to another	1837	” I had never heard of any tutor but Biddy and Mr. Wopsle ’s great - aunt ; so , I replied in the negative . “
64863	64868	64844	64846	a certain tutor	1838	” said Mr. Jaggers . “
64894	64949	64890	64892	Mr. Matthew Pocket	212	” Ah ! I caught at the name directly . Miss Havisham ’s relation . The Matthew whom Mr. and Mrs. Camilla had spoken of . The Matthew whose place was to be at Miss Havisham ’s head , when she lay dead , in her bride ’s dress on the bride ’s table . “
64955	64990	64950	64950	You	0	” said Mr. Jaggers , looking shrewdly at me , and then shutting up his eyes while he waited for my answer . My answer was , that I had heard of the name . “
64993	64997	64950	64950	You	0	” said he . “
65017	65037	65012	65012	you	0	” I said , or tried to say , that I was much obliged to him for his recommendation — “
65044	65055	65012	65012	you	0	” he interrupted , shaking his great head very slowly . “
65059	65078	65057	65057	yourself	0	” Not recollecting myself , I began again that I was much obliged to him for his recommendation — “
65085	65098	65081	65083	my young friend	1841	” he interrupted , shaking his head and frowning and smiling both at once,—“no
65138	65159	65132	65133	Mr. Pip	249	” Correcting myself , I said that I was much obliged to him for his mention of Mr. Matthew Pocket — “
65168	65184	65132	65133	Mr. Pip	249	” cried Mr. Jaggers.—And ( I added ) , I would gladly try that gentleman . “
65225	65249	65220	65220	you	0	” I said ( glancing at Joe , who stood looking on , motionless ) , that I supposed I could come directly . “
65252	65257	65220	65220	you	0	” said Mr. Jaggers , “
65295	65358	65289	65289	I	0	” He produced a long purse , with the greatest coolness , and counted them out on the table and pushed them over to me . This was the first time he had taken his leg from the chair . He sat astride of the chair when he had pushed the money over , and sat swinging his purse and eyeing Joe . “
65368	65369	65364	65364	You	158	” “
65375	65385	65364	65364	You	158	” said Joe , in a very decided manner . “
65398	65399	65390	65390	you	0	” “
65404	65408	65390	65390	you	0	” said Joe . “
65422	65423	65390	65390	you	0	” “
65427	65434	65390	65390	you	0	” said Mr. Jaggers , swinging his purse,—“what
65450	65451	65439	65439	my	0	” “
65457	65461	65439	65439	my	0	” Joe demanded . “
65469	65516	65517	65517	Pip	249	” Joe laid his hand upon my shoulder with the touch of a woman . I have often thought him since , like the steam - hammer that can crush a man or pat an egg - shell , in his combination of strength with gentleness . “
65523	65527	65517	65517	Pip	249	” said Joe , “
65581	65797	65800	65801	Joseph Gargery	158	” O dear good Joe , whom I was so ready to leave and so unthankful to , I see you again , with your muscular blacksmith ’s arm before your eyes , and your broad chest heaving , and your voice dying away . O dear good faithful tender Joe , I feel the loving tremble of your hand upon my arm , as solemnly this day as if it had been the rustle of an angel ’s wing ! But I encouraged Joe at the time . I was lost in the mazes of my future fortunes , and could not retrace the by - paths we had trodden together . I begged Joe to be comforted , for ( as he said ) we had ever been the best of friends , and ( as I said ) we ever would be so . Joe scooped his eyes with his disengaged wrist , as if he were bent on gouging himself , but said not another word . Mr. Jaggers had looked on at this , as one who recognised in Joe the village idiot , and in me his keeper . When it was over , he said , weighing in his hand the purse he had ceased to swing : — “
65853	65880	65848	65848	you	158	” Here , to his great amazement , he was stopped by Joe ’s suddenly working round him with every demonstration of a fell pugilistic purpose . “
65885	65889	65882	65882	I	0	” cried Joe , “
65937	66028	65926	65926	I	0	” I drew Joe away , and he immediately became placable ; merely stating to me , in an obliging manner and as a polite expostulatory notice to any one whom it might happen to concern , that he were not a - going to be bull - baited and badgered in his own place . Mr. Jaggers had risen when Joe demonstrated , and had backed near the door . Without evincing any inclination to come in again , he there delivered his valedictory remarks . They were these . “
66135	66198	66199	66199	I	0	” He was throwing his finger at both of us , and I think would have gone on , but for his seeming to think Joe dangerous , and going off . Something came into my head which induced me to run after him , as he was going down to the Jolly Bargemen , where he had left a hired carriage . “
66207	66208	66204	66205	Mr. Jaggers	245	” “
66211	66218	66201	66201	your	0	” said he , facing round , “
66224	66225	66226	66226	I	0	” “
66274	66275	66226	66226	I	0	” “
66278	66290	66226	66226	I	0	” said he , looking as if he hardly understood me . “
66304	66305	66226	66226	I	0	” “
66308	66312	66226	66226	I	0	” said he . “
66316	66466	66467	66467	Joe	158	” I thanked him and ran home again , and there I found that Joe had already locked the front door and vacated the state parlour , and was seated by the kitchen fire with a hand on each knee , gazing intently at the burning coals . I too sat down before the fire and gazed at the coals , and nothing was said for a long time . My sister was in her cushioned chair in her corner , and Biddy sat at her needle - work before the fire , and Joe sat next Biddy , and I sat next Joe in the corner opposite my sister . The more I looked into the glowing coals , the more incapable I became of looking at Joe ; the longer the silence lasted , the more unable I felt to speak . At length I got out , “
66474	66475	66470	66470	you	158	” “
66480	66510	66478	66478	Pip	249	” returned Joe , still looking at the fire , and holding his knees tight , as if he had private information that they intended to make off somewhere , “
66520	66521	66518	66518	Pip	249	” “
66530	66531	66528	66528	Joe	158	” “
66541	66545	66532	66532	Pip	249	” said Joe , “
66553	66713	66547	66547	God	180	” Biddy dropped her work , and looked at me . Joe held his knees and looked at me . I looked at both of them . After a pause , they both heartily congratulated me ; but there was a certain touch of sadness in their congratulations that I rather resented . I took it upon myself to impress Biddy ( and through Biddy , Joe ) with the grave obligation I considered my friends under , to know nothing and say nothing about the maker of my fortune . It would all come out in good time , I observed , and in the meanwhile nothing was to be said , save that I had come into great expectations from a mysterious patron . Biddy nodded her head thoughtfully at the fire as she took up her work again , and said she would be very particular ; and Joe , still detaining his knees , said , “
66726	66808	66809	66809	Pip	249	” and then they congratulated me again , and went on to express so much wonder at the notion of my being a gentleman that I did n’t half like it . Infinite pains were then taken by Biddy to convey to my sister some idea of what had happened . To the best of my belief , those efforts entirely failed . She laughed and nodded her head a great many times , and even repeated after Biddy , the words “
66810	66812	66547	66547	God	180	” and “
66815	67070	66547	66547	God	180	” But I doubt if they had more meaning in them than an election cry , and I can not suggest a darker picture of her state of mind . I never could have believed it without experience , but as Joe and Biddy became more at their cheerful ease again , I became quite gloomy . Dissatisfied with my fortune , of course I could not be ; but it is possible that I may have been , without quite knowing it , dissatisfied with myself . Anyhow , I sat with my elbow on my knee and my face upon my hand , looking into the fire , as those two talked about my going away , and about what they should do without me , and all that . And whenever I caught one of them looking at me , though never so pleasantly ( and they often looked at me,—particularly Biddy ) , I felt offended : as if they were expressing some mistrust of me . Though Heaven knows they never did by word or sign . At those times I would get up and look out at the door ; for our kitchen door opened at once upon the night , and stood open on summer evenings to air the room . The very stars to which I then raised my eyes , I am afraid I took to be but poor and humble stars for glittering on the rustic objects among which I had passed my life . “
67074	67091	66547	66547	God	180	” said I , when we sat at our supper of bread and cheese and beer . “
67111	67112	67115	67115	Pip	249	” “
67117	67131	67115	67115	Pip	249	” observed Joe , whose voice sounded hollow in his beer - mug . “
67137	67138	67132	67132	They	1857	” “
67144	67148	67149	67149	I	0	” said Biddy . “
67213	67214	67215	67215	Mr.	1862	” “
67235	67278	67233	67233	Pip	249	” said Joe , industriously cutting his bread , with his cheese on it , in the palm of his left hand , and glancing at my untasted supper as if he thought of the time when we used to compare slices . “
67294	67295	67284	67286	the Jolly Bargemen	1292	” “
67326	67327	67320	67320	I	0	” “
67335	67339	67333	67333	Pip	249	” said Joe . “
67347	67362	67341	67341	you	249	” Biddy asked me here , as she sat holding my sister ’s plate , “
67393	67394	67395	67395	Biddy	186	” “
67397	67404	67395	67395	Biddy	186	” I returned with some resentment , “
67420	67422	67423	67423	She	4678	” ( “
67428	67433	67423	67423	She	4678	” observed Joe . ) “
67470	68437	68444	68444	Pip	249	” Biddy said no more . Handsomely forgiving her , I soon exchanged an affectionate good night with her and Joe , and went up to bed . When I got into my little room , I sat down and took a long look at it , as a mean little room that I should soon be parted from and raised above , for ever . It was furnished with fresh young remembrances too , and even at the same moment I fell into much the same confused division of mind between it and the better rooms to which I was going , as I had been in so often between the forge and Miss Havisham ’s , and Biddy and Estella . The sun had been shining brightly all day on the roof of my attic , and the room was warm . As I put the window open and stood looking out , I saw Joe come slowly forth at the dark door , below , and take a turn or two in the air ; and then I saw Biddy come , and bring him a pipe and light it for him . He never smoked so late , and it seemed to hint to me that he wanted comforting , for some reason or other . He presently stood at the door immediately beneath me , smoking his pipe , and Biddy stood there too , quietly talking to him , and I knew that they talked of me , for I heard my name mentioned in an endearing tone by both of them more than once . I would not have listened for more , if I could have heard more ; so I drew away from the window , and sat down in my one chair by the bedside , feeling it very sorrowful and strange that this first night of my bright fortunes should be the loneliest I had ever known . Looking towards the open window , I saw light wreaths from Joe ’s pipe floating there , and I fancied it was like a blessing from Joe,—not obtruded on me or paraded before me , but pervading the air we shared together . I put my light out , and crept into bed ; and it was an uneasy bed now , and I never slept the old sound sleep in it any more . Chapter XIX . Morning made a considerable difference in my general prospect of Life , and brightened it so much that it scarcely seemed the same . What lay heaviest on my mind was , the consideration that six days intervened between me and the day of departure ; for I could not divest myself of a misgiving that something might happen to London in the meanwhile , and that , when I got there , it would be either greatly deteriorated or clean gone . Joe and Biddy were very sympathetic and pleasant when I spoke of our approaching separation ; but they only referred to it when I did . After breakfast , Joe brought out my indentures from the press in the best parlour , and we put them in the fire , and I felt that I was free . With all the novelty of my emancipation on me , I went to church with Joe , and thought perhaps the clergyman would n’t have read that about the rich man and the kingdom of Heaven , if he had known all . After our early dinner , I strolled out alone , purposing to finish off the marshes at once , and get them done with . As I passed the church , I felt ( as I had felt during service in the morning ) a sublime compassion for the poor creatures who were destined to go there , Sunday after Sunday , all their lives through , and to lie obscurely at last among the low green mounds . I promised myself that I would do something for them one of these days , and formed a plan in outline for bestowing a dinner of roast - beef and plum - pudding , a pint of ale , and a gallon of condescension , upon everybody in the village . If I had often thought before , with something allied to shame , of my companionship with the fugitive whom I had once seen limping among those graves , what were my thoughts on this Sunday , when the place recalled the wretch , ragged and shivering , with his felon iron and badge ! My comfort was , that it happened a long time ago , and that he had doubtless been transported a long way off , and that he was dead to me , and might be veritably dead into the bargain . No more low , wet grounds , no more dikes and sluices , no more of these grazing cattle,—though they seemed , in their dull manner , to wear a more respectful air now , and to face round , in order that they might stare as long as possible at the possessor of such great expectations,—farewell , monotonous acquaintances of my childhood , henceforth I was for London and greatness ; not for smith ’s work in general , and for you ! I made my exultant way to the old Battery , and , lying down there to consider the question whether Miss Havisham intended me for Estella , fell asleep . When I awoke , I was much surprised to find Joe sitting beside me , smoking his pipe . He greeted me with a cheerful smile on my opening my eyes , and said , — “
68452	68453	68448	68448	I	0	” “
68465	68466	68455	68455	Joe	158	” “
68471	68472	68469	68469	Pip	249	” “
68481	68492	68473	68473	You	158	” I went on , after we had shaken hands , “
68500	68501	68506	68506	Pip	249	” “
68508	68517	68506	68506	Pip	249	” said Joe , in a comfortable tone , “
68579	68612	68615	68615	you	249	” Somehow , I was not best pleased with Joe ’s being so mightily secure of me . I should have liked him to have betrayed emotion , or to have said , “
68620	68682	68684	68684	you	249	” or something of that sort . Therefore , I made no remark on Joe ’s first head ; merely saying as to his second , that the tidings had indeed come suddenly , but that I had always wanted to be a gentleman , and had often and often speculated on what I would do , if I were one . “
68687	68691	68684	68684	you	249	” said Joe . “
68694	68695	68684	68684	you	249	” “
68704	68708	68702	68702	Joe	158	” said I , “
68730	68731	68702	68702	Joe	158	” “
68739	68743	68734	68734	I	0	” returned Joe . “
68793	68917	68790	68790	you	158	” What I had meant was , that when I came into my property and was able to do something for Joe , it would have been much more agreeable if he had been better qualified for a rise in station . He was so perfectly innocent of my meaning , however , that I thought I would mention it to Biddy in preference . So , when we had walked home and had had tea , I took Biddy into our little garden by the side of the lane , and , after throwing out in a general way for the elevation of her spirits , that I should never forget her , said I had a favour to ask of her . “
68924	68928	68930	68930	you	186	” said I , “
68944	68945	68930	68930	you	186	” “
68951	68962	68930	68930	you	186	” asked Biddy , with a steady sort of glance . “
69003	69034	68994	68994	Biddy	186	” Although I was looking at Biddy as I spoke , and although she opened her eyes very wide when I had spoken , she did not look at me . “
69047	69058	69059	69059	My	0	” asked Biddy , plucking a black - currant leaf . “
69069	69070	69073	69073	they	1874	” “
69081	69094	69096	69096	me	0	” interrupted Biddy , looking closely at the leaf in her hand . “
69131	69132	69124	69124	they	1874	” “
69142	69175	69136	69136	you	186	” asked Biddy . It was such a very provoking question ( for it had never in the most distant manner occurred to me ) , that I said , snappishly , — “
69183	69222	69180	69180	you	186	” Biddy , having rubbed the leaf to pieces between her hands,—and the smell of a black - currant bush has ever since recalled to me that evening in the little garden by the side of the lane,—said , “
69233	69234	69224	69224	you	186	” “
69237	69245	69224	69224	you	186	” I repeated , with disdainful emphasis . “
69255	69268	69283	69283	you	186	” said Biddy , looking full at me and shaking her head ; “
69277	69278	69283	69283	you	186	” “
69287	69290	69283	69283	you	186	” said I. “
69297	69301	69302	69302	He	1871	” resumed Biddy . “
69363	69364	69367	69367	Biddy	186	” “
69369	69373	69367	69367	Biddy	186	” said I , “
69422	69423	69415	69415	you	186	” “
69433	69437	69425	69425	you	186	” returned Biddy , “
69457	69458	69425	69425	you	186	” “
69473	69484	69468	69468	you	186	” said I , in a virtuous and superior tone ; “
69559	69563	69547	69547	I	0	” I repeated . “
69577	69578	69580	69580	you	186	” “
69588	69593	69580	69580	you	186	” returned poor Biddy , “
69644	69842	69636	69637	a gentleman	4618	” said Biddy , turning away her head . I again warmly repeated that it was a bad side of human nature ( in which sentiment , waiving its application , I have since seen reason to think I was right ) , and I walked down the little path away from Biddy , and Biddy went into the house , and I went out at the garden gate and took a dejected stroll until supper - time ; again feeling it very sorrowful and strange that this , the second night of my bright fortunes , should be as lonely and unsatisfactory as the first . But , morning once more brightened my view , and I extended my clemency to Biddy , and we dropped the subject . Putting on the best clothes I had , I went into town as early as I could hope to find the shops open , and presented myself before Mr. Trabb , the tailor , who was having his breakfast in the parlour behind his shop , and who did not think it worth his while to come out to me , but called me in to him . “
69845	69863	69636	69637	a gentleman	4618	” said Mr. Trabb , in a hail - fellow - well - met kind of way . “
69876	69960	69961	69962	Mr. Trabb	255	” Mr. Trabb had sliced his hot roll into three feather - beds , and was slipping butter in between the blankets , and covering it up . He was a prosperous old bachelor , and his open window looked into a prosperous little garden and orchard , and there was a prosperous iron safe let into the wall at the side of his fireplace , and I did not doubt that heaps of his prosperity were put away in it in bags . “
69964	69968	69961	69962	Mr. Trabb	255	” said I , “
69994	70025	69986	69986	I	0	” A change passed over Mr. Trabb . He forgot the butter in bed , got up from the bedside , and wiped his fingers on the tablecloth , exclaiming , “
70031	70032	69986	69986	I	0	” “
70043	70060	70062	70062	I	0	” said I , casually drawing some guineas out of my pocket and looking at them ; “
70080	70095	70073	70073	I	0	” I added — otherwise I thought he might only pretend to make them , “
70100	70101	70102	70102	My	0	” “
70106	70136	70102	70102	My	0	” said Mr. Trabb , as he respectfully bent his body , opened his arms , and took the liberty of touching me on the outside of each elbow , “
70164	70246	70153	70153	you	1881	” Mr. Trabb ’s boy was the most audacious boy in all that country - side . When I had entered he was sweeping the shop , and he had sweetened his labours by sweeping over me . He was still sweeping when I came out into the shop with Mr. Trabb , and he knocked the broom against all possible corners and obstacles , to express ( as I understood it ) equality with any blacksmith , alive or dead . “
70251	70261	70153	70153	you	1881	” said Mr. Trabb , with the greatest sternness , “
70282	70318	70269	70269	me	0	” said Mr. Trabb , taking down a roll of cloth , and tiding it out in a flowing manner over the counter , preparatory to getting his hand under it to show the gloss , “
70356	70430	70351	70352	Number Four	256	” ( To the boy , and with a dreadfully severe stare ; foreseeing the danger of that miscreant ’s brushing me with it , or making some other sign of familiarity . ) Mr. Trabb never removed his stern eye from the boy until he had deposited number four on the counter and was at a safe distance again . Then he commanded him to bring number five , and number eight . “
70441	70446	70433	70433	me	0	” said Mr. Trabb , “
70465	70539	70453	70455	you young scoundrel	1886	” Mr. Trabb then bent over number four , and in a sort of deferential confidence recommended it to me as a light article for summer wear , an article much in vogue among the nobility and gentry , an article that it would ever be an honour to him to reflect upon a distinguished fellow - townsman ’s ( if he might claim me for a fellow - townsman ) having worn . “
70551	70561	70541	70541	you	1883	” said Mr. Trabb to the boy after that , “
70576	70627	70541	70541	you	1883	” I selected the materials for a suit , with the assistance of Mr. Trabb ’s judgment , and re - entered the parlour to be measured . For although Mr. Trabb had my measure already , and had previously been quite contented with it , he said apologetically that it “
70640	70724	70725	70725	I	0	” So , Mr. Trabb measured and calculated me in the parlour , as if I were an estate and he the finest species of surveyor , and gave himself such a world of trouble that I felt that no suit of clothes could possibly remunerate him for his pains . When he had at last done and had appointed to send the articles to Mr. Pumblechook ’s on the Thursday evening , he said , with his hand upon the parlour lock , “
70779	71036	70774	70774	sir	4442	” The last word was flung at the boy , who had not the least notion what it meant . But I saw him collapse as his master rubbed me out with his hands , and my first decided experience of the stupendous power of money was , that it had morally laid upon his back Trabb ’s boy . After this memorable event , I went to the hatter ’s , and the bootmaker ’s , and the hosier ’s , and felt rather like Mother Hubbard ’s dog whose outfit required the services of so many trades . I also went to the coach - office and took my place for seven o’clock on Saturday morning . It was not necessary to explain everywhere that I had come into a handsome property ; but whenever I said anything to that effect , it followed that the officiating tradesman ceased to have his attention diverted through the window by the High Street , and concentrated his mind upon me . When I had ordered everything I wanted , I directed my steps towards Pumblechook ’s , and , as I approached that gentleman ’s place of business , I saw him standing at his door . He was waiting for me with great impatience . He had been out early with the chaise - cart , and had called at the forge and heard the news . He had prepared a collation for me in the Barnwell parlour , and he too ordered his shopman to “
71042	71049	71050	71052	My dear friend	1894	” as my sacred person passed . “
71054	71075	71050	71052	My dear friend	1894	” said Mr. Pumblechook , taking me by both hands , when he and I and the collation were alone , “
71091	71110	71050	71052	My dear friend	1894	” This was coming to the point , and I thought it a sensible way of expressing himself . “
71114	71128	71050	71052	My dear friend	1894	” said Mr. Pumblechook , after snorting admiration at me for some moments , “
71148	71169	71170	71170	My	0	” I begged Mr. Pumblechook to remember that nothing was to be ever said or hinted , on that point . “
71175	71180	71170	71170	My	0	” said Mr. Pumblechook ; “
71191	71194	71182	71182	you	1894	” I murmured “
71197	71229	71182	71182	you	1894	” and Mr. Pumblechook took me by both hands again , and communicated a movement to his waistcoat , which had an emotional appearance , though it was rather low down , “
71256	71269	71270	71270	Joseph	158	” said Mr. Pumblechook , in the way of a compassionate adjuration . “
71277	71295	71273	71273	Joseph	158	” Thereupon he shook his head and tapped it , expressing his sense of deficiency in Joseph . “
71302	71307	71297	71300	my dear young friend	1895	” said Mr. Pumblechook , “
71366	71382	71364	71364	I	0	” said Mr. Pumblechook , getting up again the moment after he had sat down , “
71407	71432	71402	71402	I—_may	0	” This May I , meant might he shake hands ? I consented , and he was fervent , and then sat down again . “
71437	71442	71402	71402	I—_may	0	” said Mr. Pumblechook . “
71469	71478	71465	71465	I	0	” said Mr. Pumblechook , getting up again , “
71500	71599	71497	71497	I	0	” I said he might , and he shook hands with me again , and emptied his glass and turned it upside down . I did the same ; and if I had turned myself upside down before drinking , the wine could not have gone more direct to my head . Mr. Pumblechook helped me to the liver wing , and to the best slice of tongue ( none of those out - of - the - way No Thoroughfares of Pork now ) , and took , comparatively speaking , no care of himself at all . “
71610	71622	71606	71606	You	1902	” said Mr. Pumblechook , apostrophising the fowl in the dish , “
71662	71671	71659	71659	you	1902	” said Mr. Pumblechook , getting up again , “
71682	71723	71674	71674	I	0	” It began to be unnecessary to repeat the form of saying he might , so he did it at once . How he ever did it so often without wounding himself with my knife , I do n’t know . “
71728	71738	71674	71674	I	0	” he resumed , after a little steady eating , “
71772	71789	71790	71790	We	1906	” I saw he was about to come at me again , and I stopped him . “
71796	71799	71790	71790	We	1906	” said I. “
71802	71818	71823	71823	you	1902	” cried Mr. Pumblechook , leaning back in his chair , quite flaccid with admiration , “
71829	71855	71823	71823	you	1902	” ( I do n’t know who Sir was , but he certainly was not I , and there was no third person present ) ; “
71878	71897	71913	71913	I	0	” said the servile Pumblechook , putting down his untasted glass in a hurry and getting up again , “
71916	71933	71913	71913	I	0	” When he had done it , he resumed his seat and drank to my sister . “
71940	71945	71947	71947	her	1913	” said Mr. Pumblechook , “
71962	72401	71958	71958	she	1913	” At about this time , I began to observe that he was getting flushed in the face ; as to myself , I felt all face , steeped in wine and smarting . I mentioned to Mr. Pumblechook that I wished to have my new clothes sent to his house , and he was ecstatic on my so distinguishing him . I mentioned my reason for desiring to avoid observation in the village , and he lauded it to the skies . There was nobody but himself , he intimated , worthy of my confidence , and — in short , might he ? Then he asked me tenderly if I remembered our boyish games at sums , and how we had gone together to have me bound apprentice , and , in effect , how he had ever been my favourite fancy and my chosen friend ? If I had taken ten times as many glasses of wine as I had , I should have known that he never had stood in that relation towards me , and should in my heart of hearts have repudiated the idea . Yet for all that , I remember feeling convinced that I had been much mistaken in him , and that he was a sensible , practical , good - hearted prime fellow . By degrees he fell to reposing such great confidence in me , as to ask my advice in reference to his own affairs . He mentioned that there was an opportunity for a great amalgamation and monopoly of the corn and seed trade on those premises , if enlarged , such as had never occurred before in that or any other neighbourhood . What alone was wanting to the realisation of a vast fortune , he considered to be More Capital . Those were the two little words , more capital . Now it appeared to him ( Pumblechook ) that if that capital were got into the business , through a sleeping partner , sir,—which sleeping partner would have nothing to do but walk in , by self or deputy , whenever he pleased , and examine the books,—and walk in twice a year and take his profits away in his pocket , to the tune of fifty per cent,—it appeared to him that that might be an opening for a young gentleman of spirit combined with property , which would be worthy of his attention . But what did I think ? He had great confidence in my opinion , and what did I think ? I gave it as my opinion . “
72406	72519	71958	71958	she	1913	” The united vastness and distinctness of this view so struck him , that he no longer asked if he might shake hands with me , but said he really must,—and did . We drank all the wine , and Mr. Pumblechook pledged himself over and over again to keep Joseph up to the mark ( I do n’t know what mark ) , and to render me efficient and constant service ( I do n’t know what service ) . He also made known to me for the first time in my life , and certainly after having kept his secret wonderfully well , that he had always said of me , “
72541	72650	72536	72539	no common fortun ’	1916	” He said with a tearful smile that it was a singular thing to think of now , and I said so too . Finally , I went out into the air , with a dim perception that there was something unwonted in the conduct of the sunshine , and found that I had slumberously got to the turnpike without having taken any account of the road . There , I was roused by Mr. Pumblechook ’s hailing me . He was a long way down the sunny street , and was making expressive gestures for me to stop . I stopped , and he came up breathless . “
72657	72669	72536	72539	no common fortun ’	1916	” said he , when he had recovered wind for speech . “
72705	73134	73135	73135	You	1919	” We shook hands for the hundredth time at least , and he ordered a young carter out of my way with the greatest indignation . Then , he blessed me and stood waving his hand to me until I had passed the crook in the road ; and then I turned into a field and had a long nap under a hedge before I pursued my way home . I had scant luggage to take with me to London , for little of the little I possessed was adapted to my new station . But I began packing that same afternoon , and wildly packed up things that I knew I should want next morning , in a fiction that there was not a moment to be lost . So , Tuesday , Wednesday , and Thursday , passed ; and on Friday morning I went to Mr. Pumblechook ’s , to put on my new clothes and pay my visit to Miss Havisham . Mr. Pumblechook ’s own room was given up to me to dress in , and was decorated with clean towels expressly for the event . My clothes were rather a disappointment , of course . Probably every new and eagerly expected garment ever put on since clothes came in , fell a trifle short of the wearer ’s expectation . But after I had had my new suit on some half an hour , and had gone through an immensity of posturing with Mr. Pumblechook ’s very limited dressing - glass , in the futile endeavour to see my legs , it seemed to fit me better . It being market morning at a neighbouring town some ten miles off , Mr. Pumblechook was not at home . I had not told him exactly when I meant to leave , and was not likely to shake hands with him again before departing . This was all as it should be , and I went out in my new array , fearfully ashamed of having to pass the shopman , and suspicious after all that I was at a personal disadvantage , something like Joe ’s in his Sunday suit . I went circuitously to Miss Havisham ’s by all the back ways , and rang at the bell constrainedly , on account of the stiff long fingers of my gloves . Sarah Pocket came to the gate , and positively reeled back when she saw me so changed ; her walnut - shell countenance likewise turned from brown to green and yellow . “
73137	73141	73142	73142	You	1919	” said she . “
73152	73153	73149	73149	you	1919	” “
73163	73167	73160	73161	Miss Pocket	210	” said I , “
73179	73279	73176	73177	Miss Havisham	227	” I was not expected , for she left me locked in the yard , while she went to ask if I were to be admitted . After a very short delay , she returned and took me up , staring at me all the way . Miss Havisham was taking exercise in the room with the long spread table , leaning on her crutch stick . The room was lighted as of yore , and at the sound of our entrance , she stopped and turned . She was then just abreast of the rotted bride - cake . “
73286	73290	73284	73284	Sarah	210	” she said . “
73295	73296	73293	73293	Pip	249	” “
73309	73318	73302	73303	Miss Havisham	227	” I was exceedingly careful what I said , “
73333	73334	73322	73322	you	249	” “
73343	73373	73341	73341	Pip	249	” said she , making her crutch stick play round me , as if she , the fairy godmother who had changed me , were bestowing the finishing gift . “
73390	73394	73387	73388	Miss Havisham	227	” I murmured . “
73406	73407	73403	73404	Miss Havisham	227	” “
73412	73427	73403	73404	Miss Havisham	227	” said she , looking at the discomfited and envious Sarah , with delight . “
73451	73452	73455	73456	Miss Havisham	227	” “
73458	73459	73455	73456	Miss Havisham	227	” “
73469	73470	73473	73474	Miss Havisham	227	” “
73476	73477	73473	73474	Miss Havisham	227	” “
73481	73482	73485	73486	Miss Havisham	227	” “
73488	73489	73485	73486	Miss Havisham	227	” “
73498	73499	73491	73492	Mr. Jaggers	245	” “
73505	73527	73502	73503	Miss Havisham	227	” She quite gloated on these questions and answers , so keen was her enjoyment of Sarah Pocket ’s jealous dismay . “
73530	73535	73502	73503	Miss Havisham	227	” she went on ; “
73558	73583	73553	73554	Mr. Jaggers	245	” She looked at me , and looked at Sarah , and Sarah ’s countenance wrung out of her watchful face a cruel smile . “
73600	73601	73604	73605	Miss Havisham	227	” “
73607	73608	73604	73605	Miss Havisham	227	” “
73615	73746	73613	73613	Pip	249	” She stretched out her hand , and I went down on my knee and put it to my lips . I had not considered how I should take leave of her ; it came naturally to me at the moment to do this . She looked at Sarah Pocket with triumph in her weird eyes , and so I left my fairy godmother , with both her hands on her crutch stick , standing in the midst of the dimly lighted room beside the rotten bride - cake that was hidden in cobwebs . Sarah Pocket conducted me down , as if I were a ghost who must be seen out . She could not get over my appearance , and was in the last degree confounded . I said “
73754	74336	73751	73752	Miss Pocket	210	” but she merely stared , and did not seem collected enough to know that I had spoken . Clear of the house , I made the best of my way back to Pumblechook ’s , took off my new clothes , made them into a bundle , and went back home in my older dress , carrying it — to speak the truth — much more at my ease too , though I had the bundle to carry . And now , those six days which were to have run out so slowly , had run out fast and were gone , and to - morrow looked me in the face more steadily than I could look at it . As the six evenings had dwindled away , to five , to four , to three , to two , I had become more and more appreciative of the society of Joe and Biddy . On this last evening , I dressed myself out in my new clothes for their delight , and sat in my splendour until bedtime . We had a hot supper on the occasion , graced by the inevitable roast fowl , and we had some flip to finish with . We were all very low , and none the higher for pretending to be in spirits . I was to leave our village at five in the morning , carrying my little hand - portmanteau , and I had told Joe that I wished to walk away all alone . I am afraid — sore afraid — that this purpose originated in my sense of the contrast there would be between me and Joe , if we went to the coach together . I had pretended with myself that there was nothing of this taint in the arrangement ; but when I went up to my little room on this last night , I felt compelled to admit that it might be so , and had an impulse upon me to go down again and entreat Joe to walk with me in the morning . I did not . All night there were coaches in my broken sleep , going to wrong places instead of to London , and having in the traces , now dogs , now cats , now pigs , now men,—never horses . Fantastic failures of journeys occupied me until the day dawned and the birds were singing . Then , I got up and partly dressed , and sat at the window to take a last look out , and in taking it fell asleep . Biddy was astir so early to get my breakfast , that , although I did not sleep at the window an hour , I smelt the smoke of the kitchen fire when I started up with a terrible idea that it must be late in the afternoon . But long after that , and long after I had heard the clinking of the teacups and was quite ready , I wanted the resolution to go downstairs . After all , I remained up there , repeatedly unlocking and unstrapping my small portmanteau and locking and strapping it up again , until Biddy called to me that I was late . It was a hurried breakfast with no taste in it . I got up from the meal , saying with a sort of briskness , as if it had only just occurred to me , “
74346	74449	74341	74341	I	0	” and then I kissed my sister who was laughing and nodding and shaking in her usual chair , and kissed Biddy , and threw my arms around Joe ’s neck . Then I took up my little portmanteau and walked out . The last I saw of them was , when I presently heard a scuffle behind me , and looking back , saw Joe throwing an old shoe after me and Biddy throwing another old shoe . I stopped then , to wave my hat , and dear old Joe waved his strong right arm above his head , crying huskily “
74452	74603	74341	74341	I	0	” and Biddy put her apron to her face . I walked away at a good pace , thinking it was easier to go than I had supposed it would be , and reflecting that it would never have done to have had an old shoe thrown after the coach , in sight of all the High Street . I whistled and made nothing of going . But the village was very peaceful and quiet , and the light mists were solemnly rising , as if to show me the world , and I had been so innocent and little there , and all beyond was so unknown and great , that in a moment with a strong heave and sob I broke into tears . It was by the finger - post at the end of the village , and I laid my hand upon it , and said , “
74615	75025	74612	74613	dear friend	1923	” Heaven knows we need never be ashamed of our tears , for they are rain upon the blinding dust of earth , overlying our hard hearts . I was better after I had cried than before,—more sorry , more aware of my own ingratitude , more gentle . If I had cried before , I should have had Joe with me then . So subdued I was by those tears , and by their breaking out again in the course of the quiet walk , that when I was on the coach , and it was clear of the town , I deliberated with an aching heart whether I would not get down when we changed horses and walk back , and have another evening at home , and a better parting . We changed , and I had not made up my mind , and still reflected for my comfort that it would be quite practicable to get down and walk back , when we changed again . And while I was occupied with these deliberations , I would fancy an exact resemblance to Joe in some man coming along the road towards us , and my heart would beat high.—As if he could possibly be there ! We changed again , and yet again , and it was now too late and too far to go back , and I went on . And the mists had all solemnly risen now , and the world lay spread before me . THIS IS THE END OF THE FIRST STAGE OF PIP ’S EXPECTATIONS . Chapter XX . The journey from our town to the metropolis was a journey of about five hours . It was a little past midday when the four - horse stage - coach by which I was a passenger , got into the ravel of traffic frayed out about the Cross Keys , Wood Street , Cheapside , London . We Britons had at that time particularly settled that it was treasonable to doubt our having and our being the best of everything : otherwise , while I was scared by the immensity of London , I think I might have had some faint doubts whether it was not rather ugly , crooked , narrow , and dirty . Mr. Jaggers had duly sent me his address ; it was , Little Britain , and he had written after it on his card , “
75039	75266	74612	74613	dear friend	1923	” Nevertheless , a hackney - coachman , who seemed to have as many capes to his greasy great - coat as he was years old , packed me up in his coach and hemmed me in with a folding and jingling barrier of steps , as if he were going to take me fifty miles . His getting on his box , which I remember to have been decorated with an old weather - stained pea - green hammercloth moth - eaten into rags , was quite a work of time . It was a wonderful equipage , with six great coronets outside , and ragged things behind for I do n’t know how many footmen to hold on by , and a harrow below them , to prevent amateur footmen from yielding to the temptation . I had scarcely had time to enjoy the coach and to think how like a straw - yard it was , and yet how like a rag - shop , and to wonder why the horses ’ nose - bags were kept inside , when I observed the coachman beginning to get down , as if we were going to stop presently . And stop we presently did , in a gloomy street , at certain offices with an open door , whereon was painted MR . JAGGERS . “
75270	75280	75329	75329	I	0	” I asked the coachman . The coachman answered , “
75292	75305	75329	75329	I	0	” I naturally said I had no wish to make it more . “
75313	75318	75329	75329	I	0	” observed the coachman . “
75336	75408	75329	75329	I	0	” He darkly closed an eye at Mr. Jaggers ’s name , and shook his head . When he had got his shilling , and had in course of time completed the ascent to his box , and had got away ( which appeared to relieve his mind ) , I went into the front office with my little portmanteau in my hand and asked , Was Mr. Jaggers at home ? “
75413	75418	75419	75419	He	1926	” returned the clerk . “
75432	75442	75429	75430	Mr. Pip	249	” I signified that he was addressing Mr. Pip . “
75492	75550	75556	75556	Mike	264	” With those words , the clerk opened a door , and ushered me into an inner chamber at the back . Here , we found a gentleman with one eye , in a velveteen suit and knee - breeches , who wiped his nose with his sleeve on being interrupted in the perusal of the newspaper . “
75558	76381	75556	75556	Mike	264	” said the clerk . I began to say that I hoped I was not interrupting , when the clerk shoved this gentleman out with as little ceremony as I ever saw used , and tossing his fur cap out after him , left me alone . Mr. Jaggers ’s room was lighted by a skylight only , and was a most dismal place ; the skylight , eccentrically pitched like a broken head , and the distorted adjoining houses looking as if they had twisted themselves to peep down at me through it . There were not so many papers about , as I should have expected to see ; and there were some odd objects about , that I should not have expected to see,—such as an old rusty pistol , a sword in a scabbard , several strange - looking boxes and packages , and two dreadful casts on a shelf , of faces peculiarly swollen , and twitchy about the nose . Mr. Jaggers ’s own high - backed chair was of deadly black horsehair , with rows of brass nails round it , like a coffin ; and I fancied I could see how he leaned back in it , and bit his forefinger at the clients . The room was but small , and the clients seemed to have had a habit of backing up against the wall ; the wall , especially opposite to Mr. Jaggers ’s chair , being greasy with shoulders . I recalled , too , that the one - eyed gentleman had shuffled forth against the wall when I was the innocent cause of his being turned out . I sat down in the cliental chair placed over against Mr. Jaggers ’s chair , and became fascinated by the dismal atmosphere of the place . I called to mind that the clerk had the same air of knowing something to everybody else ’s disadvantage , as his master had . I wondered how many other clerks there were upstairs , and whether they all claimed to have the same detrimental mastery of their fellow - creatures . I wondered what was the history of all the odd litter about the room , and how it came there . I wondered whether the two swollen faces were of Mr. Jaggers ’s family , and , if he were so unfortunate as to have had a pair of such ill - looking relations , why he stuck them on that dusty perch for the blacks and flies to settle on , instead of giving them a place at home . Of course I had no experience of a London summer day , and my spirits may have been oppressed by the hot exhausted air , and by the dust and grit that lay thick on everything . But I sat wondering and waiting in Mr. Jaggers ’s close room , until I really could not bear the two casts on the shelf above Mr. Jaggers ’s chair , and got up and went out . When I told the clerk that I would take a turn in the air while I waited , he advised me to go round the corner and I should come into Smithfield . So I came into Smithfield ; and the shameful place , being all asmear with filth and fat and blood and foam , seemed to stick to me . So , I rubbed it off with all possible speed by turning into a street where I saw the great black dome of Saint Paul ’s bulging at me from behind a grim stone building which a bystander said was Newgate Prison . Following the wall of the jail , I found the roadway covered with straw to deaden the noise of passing vehicles ; and from this , and from the quantity of people standing about smelling strongly of spirits and beer , I inferred that the trials were on . While I looked about me here , an exceedingly dirty and partially drunk minister of justice asked me if I would like to step in and hear a trial or so : informing me that he could give me a front place for half a crown , whence I should command a full view of the Lord Chief Justice in his wig and robes,—mentioning that awful personage like waxwork , and presently offering him at the reduced price of eighteen - pence . As I declined the proposal on the plea of an appointment , he was so good as to take me into a yard and show me where the gallows was kept , and also where people were publicly whipped , and then he showed me the Debtors ’ Door , out of which culprits came to be hanged ; heightening the interest of that dreadful portal by giving me to understand that “
76385	76600	76601	76601	Jaggers	245	” would come out at that door the day after to - morrow at eight in the morning , to be killed in a row . This was horrible , and gave me a sickening idea of London ; the more so as the Lord Chief Justice ’s proprietor wore ( from his hat down to his boots and up again to his pocket - handkerchief inclusive ) mildewed clothes which had evidently not belonged to him originally , and which I took it into my head he had bought cheap of the executioner . Under these circumstances I thought myself well rid of him for a shilling . I dropped into the office to ask if Mr. Jaggers had come in yet , and I found he had not , and I strolled out again . This time , I made the tour of Little Britain , and turned into Bartholomew Close ; and now I became aware that other people were waiting about for Mr. Jaggers , as well as I. There were two men of secret appearance lounging in Bartholomew Close , and thoughtfully fitting their feet into the cracks of the pavement as they talked together , one of whom said to the other when they first passed me , that “
76612	76658	76659	76659	Jaggers	245	” There was a knot of three men and two women standing at a corner , and one of the women was crying on her dirty shawl , and the other comforted her by saying , as she pulled her own shawl over her shoulders , “
76676	76754	76755	76756	O Jaggerth	267	” There was a red - eyed little Jew who came into the Close while I was loitering there , in company with a second little Jew whom he sent upon an errand ; and while the messenger was gone , I remarked this Jew , who was of a highly excitable temperament , performing a jig of anxiety under a lamp - post and accompanying himself , in a kind of frenzy , with the words , “
76773	76887	76765	76767	Cag - Maggerth	268	” These testimonies to the popularity of my guardian made a deep impression on me , and I admired and wondered more than ever . At length , as I was looking out at the iron gate of Bartholomew Close into Little Britain , I saw Mr. Jaggers coming across the road towards me . All the others who were waiting saw him at the same time , and there was quite a rush at him . Mr. Jaggers , putting a hand on my shoulder and walking me on at his side without saying anything to me , addressed himself to his followers . First , he took the two secret men . “
76900	76911	76890	76890	I	0	” said Mr. Jaggers , throwing his finger at them . “
76952	76953	76948	76948	you	1929	” “
76964	76982	76954	76954	We	1930	” said one of the men , submissively , while the other perused Mr. Jaggers ’s face . “
77011	77012	77007	77007	Wemmick	269	” “
77017	77024	77015	77015	sir	4442	” said both the men together . “
77041	77057	77035	77035	I	0	” said Mr Jaggers , waving his hand at them to put them behind him . “
77073	77074	77075	77075	We	1933	” “
77081	77093	77078	77079	Mr. Jaggers	245	” one of the men began , pulling off his hat . “
77104	77109	77097	77097	I	0	” said Mr. Jaggers . “
77161	77187	77191	77191	you	1929	” The two men looked at one another as Mr. Jaggers waved them behind again , and humbly fell back and were heard no more . “
77194	77219	77191	77191	you	1929	” said Mr. Jaggers , suddenly stopping , and turning on the two women with the shawls , from whom the three men had meekly separated,—“Oh
77226	77227	77221	77221	Amelia	270	” “
77233	77234	77230	77231	Mr. Jaggers	245	” “
77240	77245	77237	77237	you	1929	” retorted Mr. Jaggers , “
77261	77262	77250	77250	you	1929	” “
77268	77274	77266	77266	sir	4442	” exclaimed both women together . “
77286	77287	77279	77279	sir	4442	” “
77291	77296	77266	77266	sir	4442	” said Mr. Jaggers , “
77302	77303	77298	77298	you	1929	” “
77309	77315	77307	77307	sir	4442	” the crying woman pleaded . “
77323	77328	77318	77318	I	0	” said Mr. Jaggers . “
77385	77386	77381	77381	you	1929	” “
77395	77396	77392	77393	Every farden	1941	” “
77428	77467	77468	77468	I	0	” This terrible threat caused the two women to fall off immediately . No one remained now but the excitable Jew , who had already raised the skirts of Mr. Jaggers ’s coat to his lips several times . “
77475	77486	77472	77473	this man	623	” said Mr. Jaggers , in the same devastating strain : “
77493	77494	77495	77498	Ma thear Mithter Jaggerth	271	” “
77506	77507	77510	77510	he	623	” “
77512	77517	77510	77510	he	623	” said Mr. Jaggers . “
77524	77541	77510	77510	he	623	” The suitor , kissing the hem of the garment again before relinquishing it , replied , “
77550	77551	77552	77552	You	1929	” “
77557	77562	77563	77563	I	0	” said Mr. Jaggers . “
77569	77570	77571	77572	Holy father	1944	” “
77577	77586	77593	77594	Habraham Latharuth	272	” cried my excitable acquaintance , turning white , “
77596	77597	77598	77598	I	0	” “
77601	77606	77598	77598	I	0	” said Mr. Jaggers , “
77621	77622	77623	77624	Mithter Jaggerth	271	” “
77684	77734	77681	77681	Mithter	271	” My guardian threw his supplicant off with supreme indifference , and left him dancing on the pavement as if it were red hot . Without further interruption , we reached the front office , where we found the clerk and the man in velveteen with the fur cap . “
77739	77756	77737	77737	Mike	264	” said the clerk , getting down from his stool , and approaching Mr. Jaggers confidentially . “
77759	77796	77737	77737	Mike	264	” said Mr. Jaggers , turning to the man , who was pulling a lock of hair in the middle of his forehead , like the Bull in Cock Robin pulling at the bell - rope ; “
77806	77807	77797	77798	your man	1947	” “
77813	77828	77810	77811	Mas’r Jaggers	274	” returned Mike , in the voice of a sufferer from a constitutional cold ; “
77847	77848	77851	77851	he	1947	” “
77856	77857	77851	77851	he	1947	” “
77863	77877	77860	77861	Mas’r Jaggers	274	” said Mike , wiping his nose on his fur cap this time ; “
77885	77893	77860	77861	Mas’r Jaggers	274	” Mr. Jaggers suddenly became most irate . “
77901	77913	77896	77896	I	0	” said he , throwing his forefinger at the terrified client , “
77945	77965	77940	77940	you	274	” The client looked scared , but bewildered too , as if he were unconscious what he had done . “
77968	77986	77966	77966	Spooney	275	” said the clerk , in a low voice , giving him a stir with his elbow . “
77998	77999	77991	77991	you	275	” “
78010	78018	78006	78006	you	275	” said my guardian , very sternly , “
78039	78064	78028	78029	the man	467	” Mike looked hard at my guardian , as if he were trying to learn a lesson from his face , and slowly replied , “
78086	78087	78028	78029	the man	467	” “
78102	78142	78143	78143	We	1953	” Mike looked at his cap , and looked at the floor , and looked at the ceiling , and looked at the clerk , and even looked at me , before beginning to reply in a nervous manner , “
78150	78158	78143	78143	We	1953	” when my guardian blustered out , — “
78167	78169	78165	78165	you	275	” ( “
78172	78196	78197	78197	He	623	” added the clerk again , with another stir . ) After some helpless casting about , Mike brightened and began again : — “
78214	78215	78206	78212	A sort of a pastry - cook	1955	” “
78220	78225	78226	78226	I	0	” asked my guardian . “
78230	78234	78206	78212	A sort of a pastry - cook	1955	” said Mike , “
78244	78245	78226	78226	I	0	” “
78258	78338	78226	78226	I	0	” The window indicated was the office window . We all three went to it , behind the wire blind , and presently saw the client go by in an accidental manner , with a murderous - looking tall individual , in a short suit of white linen and a paper cap . This guileless confectioner was not by any means sober , and had a black eye in the green stage of recovery , which was painted over . “
78348	78360	78340	78340	him	623	” said my guardian to the clerk , in extreme disgust , “
78375	78434	78365	78365	he	623	” My guardian then took me into his own room , and while he lunched , standing , from a sandwich - box and a pocket - flask of sherry ( he seemed to bully his very sandwich as he ate it ) , informed me what arrangements he had made for me . I was to go to “
78439	78551	78365	78365	he	623	” to young Mr. Pocket ’s rooms , where a bed had been sent in for my accommodation ; I was to remain with young Mr. Pocket until Monday ; on Monday I was to go with him to his father ’s house on a visit , that I might try how I liked it . Also , I was told what my allowance was to be,—it was a very liberal one,—and had handed to me from one of my guardian ’s drawers , the cards of certain tradesmen with whom I was to deal for all kinds of clothes , and such other things as I could in reason want . “
78562	78583	78559	78560	Mr. Pip	249	” said my guardian , whose flask of sherry smelt like a whole caskful , as he hastily refreshed himself , “
78626	78743	78744	78744	I	0	” After I had pondered a little over this encouraging sentiment , I asked Mr. Jaggers if I could send for a coach ? He said it was not worth while , I was so near my destination ; Wemmick should walk round with me , if I pleased . I then found that Wemmick was the clerk in the next room . Another clerk was rung down from upstairs to take his place while he was out , and I accompanied him into the street , after shaking hands with my guardian . We found a new set of people lingering outside , but Wemmick made a way among them by saying coolly yet decisively , “
78765	79021	78752	78752	he	0	” and we soon got clear of them , and went on side by side . Chapter XXI . Casting my eyes on Mr. Wemmick as we went along , to see what he was like in the light of day , I found him to be a dry man , rather short in stature , with a square wooden face , whose expression seemed to have been imperfectly chipped out with a dull - edged chisel . There were some marks in it that might have been dimples , if the material had been softer and the instrument finer , but which , as it was , were only dints . The chisel had made three or four of these attempts at embellishment over his nose , but had given them up without an effort to smooth them off . I judged him to be a bachelor from the frayed condition of his linen , and he appeared to have sustained a good many bereavements ; for he wore at least four mourning rings , besides a brooch representing a lady and a weeping willow at a tomb with an urn on it . I noticed , too , that several rings and seals hung at his watch - chain , as if he were quite laden with remembrances of departed friends . He had glittering eyes,—small , keen , and black,—and thin wide mottled lips . He had had them , to the best of my belief , from forty to fifty years . “
79030	79037	79023	79023	you	1963	” said Mr. Wemmick to me . “
79040	79043	79023	79023	you	1963	” said I. “
79052	79057	79045	79045	I	0	” said Mr. Wemmick . “
79064	79065	79045	79045	I	0	” “
79074	79075	79066	79066	You	1963	” “
79080	79085	79066	79066	You	1963	” said Mr. Wemmick . “
79093	79094	79086	79086	I	0	” “
79102	79117	79118	79118	You	1966	” I asked , more for the sake of saying something than for information . “
79145	79146	79193	79193	They	1967	” “
79157	79168	79193	79193	They	1967	” said I , to soften it off a little . “
79179	79184	79171	79171	I	0	” returned Mr. Wemmick ; “
79208	79209	79193	79193	They	1967	” “
79215	79216	79217	79217	You	1963	” “
79221	79226	79217	79217	You	1963	” returned Mr. Wemmick . “
79236	79323	79217	79217	You	1963	” He wore his hat on the back of his head , and looked straight before him : walking in a self - contained way as if there were nothing in the streets to claim his attention . His mouth was such a post - office of a mouth that he had a mechanical appearance of smiling . We had got to the top of Holborn Hill before I knew that it was merely a mechanical appearance , and that he was not smiling at all . “
79333	79339	79328	79330	Mr. Matthew Pocket	212	” I asked Mr. Wemmick . “
79342	79351	79328	79330	Mr. Matthew Pocket	212	” said he , nodding in the direction . “
79359	79360	79328	79330	Mr. Matthew Pocket	212	” “
79365	79366	79328	79330	Mr. Matthew Pocket	212	” “
79373	79374	79328	79330	Mr. Matthew Pocket	212	” “
79380	79381	79376	79376	you	0	” “
79392	79405	79384	79384	you	0	” said Mr. Wemmick , looking at me with an approving air . “
79418	79809	79413	79413	I	0	” There was an air of toleration or depreciation about his utterance of these words that rather depressed me ; and I was still looking sideways at his block of a face in search of any encouraging note to the text , when he said here we were at Barnard ’s Inn . My depression was not alleviated by the announcement , for , I had supposed that establishment to be an hotel kept by Mr. Barnard , to which the Blue Boar in our town was a mere public - house . Whereas I now found Barnard to be a disembodied spirit , or a fiction , and his inn the dingiest collection of shabby buildings ever squeezed together in a rank corner as a club for Tom - cats . We entered this haven through a wicket - gate , and were disgorged by an introductory passage into a melancholy little square that looked to me like a flat burying - ground . I thought it had the most dismal trees in it , and the most dismal sparrows , and the most dismal cats , and the most dismal houses ( in number half a dozen or so ) , that I had ever seen . I thought the windows of the sets of chambers into which those houses were divided were in every stage of dilapidated blind and curtain , crippled flower - pot , cracked glass , dusty decay , and miserable makeshift ; while To Let , To Let , To Let , glared at me from empty rooms , as if no new wretches ever came there , and the vengeance of the soul of Barnard were being slowly appeased by the gradual suicide of the present occupants and their unholy interment under the gravel . A frowzy mourning of soot and smoke attired this forlorn creation of Barnard , and it had strewn ashes on its head , and was undergoing penance and humiliation as a mere dust - hole . Thus far my sense of sight ; while dry rot and wet rot and all the silent rots that rot in neglected roof and cellar,—rot of rat and mouse and bug and coaching - stables near at hand besides — addressed themselves faintly to my sense of smell , and moaned , “
79815	79838	79811	79811	Barnard	277	” So imperfect was this realisation of the first of my great expectations , that I looked in dismay at Mr. Wemmick . “
79841	79848	79811	79811	Barnard	277	” said he , mistaking me ; “
79862	79944	79860	79860	me	0	” He led me into a corner and conducted me up a flight of stairs,—which appeared to me to be slowly collapsing into sawdust , so that one of those days the upper lodgers would look out at their doors and find themselves without the means of coming down,—to a set of chambers on the top floor . MR . POCKET , JUN . , was painted on the door , and there was a label on the letter - box , “
79948	79949	79950	79950	He	277	” “
79959	79964	79950	79950	He	277	” Mr. Wemmick explained . “
79973	79974	79965	79965	You	1970	” “
79980	79983	79978	79978	you	0	” said I. “
79990	79995	79978	79978	you	0	” Mr. Wemmick observed , “
80007	80008	79978	79978	you	0	” “
80012	80048	79978	79978	you	0	” I put out my hand , and Mr. Wemmick at first looked at it as if he thought I wanted something . Then he looked at me , and said , correcting himself , — “
80064	80084	80055	80055	You	1970	” I was rather confused , thinking it must be out of the London fashion , but said yes . “
80093	80096	80103	80103	I	0	” said Mr. Wemmick,—“except
80115	80313	80314	80315	Mr. Pip	249	” When we had shaken hands and he was gone , I opened the staircase window and had nearly beheaded myself , for , the lines had rotted away , and it came down like the guillotine . Happily it was so quick that I had not put my head out . After this escape , I was content to take a foggy view of the Inn through the window ’s encrusting dirt , and to stand dolefully looking out , saying to myself that London was decidedly overrated . Mr. Pocket , Junior ’s , idea of Shortly was not mine , for I had nearly maddened myself with looking out for half an hour , and had written my name with my finger several times in the dirt of every pane in the window , before I heard footsteps on the stairs . Gradually there arose before me the hat , head , neckcloth , waistcoat , trousers , boots , of a member of society of about my own standing . He had a paper - bag under each arm and a pottle of strawberries in one hand , and was out of breath . “
80317	80321	80314	80315	Mr. Pip	249	” said he . “
80325	80328	80322	80323	Mr. Pocket	279	” said I. “
80332	80336	80322	80323	Mr. Pocket	279	” he exclaimed . “
80413	80449	80402	80402	I	0	” For a reason that I had , I felt as if my eyes would start out of my head . I acknowledged his attention incoherently , and began to think this was a dream . “
80453	80460	80402	80402	I	0	” said Mr. Pocket , Junior . “
80466	80574	80402	80402	I	0	” As he was fast making jam of his fruit by wrestling with the door while the paper - bags were under his arms , I begged him to allow me to hold them . He relinquished them with an agreeable smile , and combated with the door as if it were a wild beast . It yielded so suddenly at last , that he staggered back upon me , and I staggered back upon the opposite door , and we both laughed . But still I felt as if my eyes must start out of my head , and as if this must be a dream . “
80579	80586	80588	80588	me	0	” said Mr. Pocket , Junior . “
80909	80955	80904	80904	I	0	” As I stood opposite to Mr. Pocket , Junior , delivering him the bags , One , Two , I saw the starting appearance come into his own eyes that I knew to be in mine , and he said , falling back , — “
80966	80967	80960	80960	you	1977	” “
80971	80975	80969	80969	you	1977	” said I , “
80982	81008	80977	80980	the pale young gentleman	1457	” Chapter XXII . The pale young gentleman and I stood contemplating one another in Barnard ’s Inn , until we both burst out laughing . “
81016	81020	80977	80980	the pale young gentleman	1457	” said he . “
81030	81045	80977	80980	the pale young gentleman	1457	” said I. And then we contemplated one another afresh , and laughed again . “
81048	81063	80977	80980	the pale young gentleman	1457	” said the pale young gentleman , reaching out his hand good - humouredly , “
81092	81135	81084	81084	me	0	” I derived from this speech that Mr. Herbert Pocket ( for Herbert was the pale young gentleman ’s name ) still rather confounded his intention with his execution . But I made a modest reply , and we shook hands warmly . “
81148	81153	81136	81136	You	1977	” said Herbert Pocket . “
81156	81159	81136	81136	You	1977	” said I. “
81162	81166	81167	81167	I	0	” he acquiesced : “
81188	81189	81176	81176	I	0	” “
81192	81193	81215	81215	she	227	” “
81224	81239	81220	81220	she	227	” I thought it polite to remark that I was surprised to hear that . “
81243	81249	81220	81220	she	227	” said Herbert , laughing , “
81301	81302	81292	81292	you	1992	” “
81307	81345	81292	81292	you	1992	” I asked , with sudden gravity . He was arranging his fruit in plates while we talked , which divided his attention , and was the cause of his having made this lapse of a word . “
81348	81358	81292	81292	you	1992	” he explained , still busy with the fruit . “
81375	81376	81365	81365	his	1994	” “
81384	81388	81379	81379	you	0	” I asked . “
81391	81395	81379	81379	you	0	” said he , “
81411	81412	81405	81405	She	196	” “
81416	81417	81413	81414	Miss Havisham	227	” “
81461	81462	81450	81451	Miss Havisham	227	” “
81471	81472	81468	81469	Miss Havisham	227	” “
81475	81479	81480	81481	Only adopted	1997	” said he . “
81483	81484	81480	81481	Only adopted	1997	” “
81499	81500	81501	81501	Lord	1999	” “
81506	81510	81503	81504	Mr. Pip	249	” said he . “
81516	81517	81513	81513	you	249	” “
81520	81523	81513	81513	you	249	” said I. “
81564	81615	81557	81557	you	2000	” I told him , and he was attentive until I had finished , and then burst out laughing again , and asked me if I was sore afterwards ? I did n’t ask him if _ he _ was , for my conviction on that point was perfectly established . “
81625	81630	81616	81617	Mr. Jaggers	245	” he went on . “
81633	81634	81616	81617	Mr. Jaggers	245	” “
81657	81723	81724	81724	He	245	” This was bringing me ( I felt ) towards dangerous ground . I answered with a constraint I made no attempt to disguise , that I had seen Mr. Jaggers in Miss Havisham ’s house on the very day of our combat , but never at any other time , and that I believed he had no recollection of having ever seen me there . “
81790	82141	81779	81779	he	432	” Herbert Pocket had a frank and easy way with him that was very taking . I had never seen any one then , and I have never seen any one since , who more strongly expressed to me , in every look and tone , a natural incapacity to do anything secret and mean . There was something wonderfully hopeful about his general air , and something that at the same time whispered to me he would never be very successful or rich . I do n’t know how this was . I became imbued with the notion on that first occasion before we sat down to dinner , but I can not define by what means . He was still a pale young gentleman , and had a certain conquered languor about him in the midst of his spirits and briskness , that did not seem indicative of natural strength . He had not a handsome face , but it was better than handsome : being extremely amiable and cheerful . His figure was a little ungainly , as in the days when my knuckles had taken such liberties with it , but it looked as if it would always be light and young . Whether Mr. Trabb ’s local work would have sat more gracefully on him than on me , may be a question ; but I am conscious that he carried off his rather old clothes much better than I carried off my new suit . As he was so communicative , I felt that reserve on my part would be a bad return unsuited to our years . I therefore told him my small story , and laid stress on my being forbidden to inquire who my benefactor was . I further mentioned that as I had been brought up a blacksmith in a country place , and knew very little of the ways of politeness , I would take it as a great kindness in him if he would give me a hint whenever he saw me at a loss or going wrong . “
82145	82149	81779	81779	he	432	” said he , “
82204	82225	82185	82185	you	0	” I thanked him and said I would . I informed him in exchange that my Christian name was Philip . “
82233	82239	82226	82226	I	0	” said he , smiling , “
82339	82340	82341	82341	I	0	” “
82350	82354	82347	82347	you	0	” I answered , “
82362	82363	82356	82356	I	0	” “
82388	82389	82390	82390	I	0	” “
82397	82398	82390	82390	I	0	” “
82405	82416	82403	82403	Handel	284	” said he , turning round as the door opened , “
82444	82681	82702	82702	Handel	284	” This I would not hear of , so he took the top , and I faced him . It was a nice little dinner,—seemed to me then a very Lord Mayor ’s Feast,—and it acquired additional relish from being eaten under those independent circumstances , with no old people by , and with London all around us . This again was heightened by a certain gypsy character that set the banquet off ; for while the table was , as Mr. Pumblechook might have said , the lap of luxury,—being entirely furnished forth from the coffee - house,—the circumjacent region of sitting - room was of a comparatively pastureless and shifty character ; imposing on the waiter the wandering habits of putting the covers on the floor ( where he fell over them ) , the melted butter in the arm - chair , the bread on the bookshelves , the cheese in the coal - scuttle , and the boiled fowl into my bed in the next room,—where I found much of its parsley and butter in a state of congelation when I retired for the night . All this made the feast delightful , and when the waiter was not there to watch me , my pleasure was without alloy . We had made some progress in the dinner , when I reminded Herbert of his promise to tell me about Miss Havisham . “
82684	82688	82702	82702	Handel	284	” he replied . “
82817	82838	82797	82797	you	2024	” He offered these friendly suggestions in such a lively way , that we both laughed and I scarcely blushed . “
82841	82845	82847	82848	Miss Havisham	227	” he pursued , “
82945	82946	82939	82939	You	2024	” “
82961	82964	82959	82959	he	4618	” said I. “
82970	82974	82959	82959	he	4618	” returned Herbert ; “
83001	83002	82998	82999	his daughter	2038	” “
83010	83014	82998	82999	his daughter	2038	” I hazarded . “
83054	83055	83047	83048	his cook	2043	” “
83062	83065	83058	83058	he	285	” said I. “
83224	83250	83260	83261	Miss Havisham	227	” I had been doing this , in an excess of attention to his recital . I thanked him , and apologised . He said , “
83255	83259	83260	83261	Miss Havisham	227	” and resumed . “
83376	83441	83446	83446	I	0	” Why I was trying to pack mine into my tumbler , I am wholly unable to say . I only know that I found myself , with a perseverance worthy of a much better cause , making the most strenuous exertions to compress it within those limits . Again I thanked him and apologised , and again he said in the cheerfullest manner , “
83450	83454	83446	83446	I	0	” and resumed . “
83862	83870	83871	83871	Matthew	212	” I thought of her having said , “
83888	83902	83871	83871	Matthew	212	” and I asked Herbert whether his father was so inveterate against her ? “
83908	83912	83914	83914	she	227	” said he , “
84018	84019	84012	84012	He	432	” “
84024	84029	84012	84012	He	432	” I struck in , “
84044	84045	84012	84012	He	432	” “
84052	84058	84061	84061	she	227	” said Herbert , nodding , “
84132	84133	84107	84107	she	227	” “
84140	84148	84107	84107	she	227	” I asked , after considering it . “
84250	84251	84254	84254	he	2094	” “
84265	84268	84254	84254	he	2094	” said I. “
84293	84297	84277	84277	her	227	” said Herbert . “
84306	84307	84300	84300	I	0	” “
84315	84325	84326	84326	They	5563	” I asked , after again considering the subject . “
84343	84344	84326	84326	They	5563	” “
84350	84351	84352	84352	I	0	” “
84357	84358	84352	84352	I	0	” “
84378	84384	84359	84359	You	0	” Herbert shrugged his shoulders . “
84411	84424	84409	84409	Handel	284	” said he , finally throwing off the story as it were , “
84445	84446	84442	84442	you	284	” “
84453	84457	84458	84458	you	0	” I retorted , “
84461	84462	84458	84458	you	0	” “
84535	84680	84681	84685	A capitalist,—an Insurer of Ships	2101	” In truth , he said this with so much delicacy , that I felt the subject done with , even though I should be under his father ’s roof for years and years to come . Yet he said it with so much meaning , too , that I felt he as perfectly understood Miss Havisham to be my benefactress , as I understood the fact myself . It had not occurred to me before , that he had led up to the theme for the purpose of clearing it out of our way ; but we were so much the lighter and easier for having broached it , that I now perceived this to be the case . We were very gay and sociable , and I asked him , in the course of conversation , what he was ? He replied , “
84687	84712	84681	84685	A capitalist,—an Insurer of Ships	2101	” I suppose he saw me glancing about the room in search of some tokens of Shipping , or capital , for he added , “
84717	84789	84790	84790	I	0	” I had grand ideas of the wealth and importance of Insurers of Ships in the City , and I began to think with awe of having laid a young Insurer on his back , blackened his enterprising eye , and cut his responsible head open . But again there came upon me , for my relief , that odd impression that Herbert Pocket would never be very successful or rich . “
84855	84865	84849	84849	I	0	” said he , leaning back in his chair , “
84892	84893	84849	84849	I	0	” “
84900	84903	84849	84849	I	0	” said I. “
84906	84929	84930	84930	I	0	” said he . I wavered again , and began to think here were greater expectations than my own . [ Illustration ] “
84938	84952	84932	84932	I	0	” said he , putting his thumbs in his waist - coat pockets , “
84976	84977	84978	84978	You	0	” “
84986	84989	84990	84992	A perfect fleet	2105	” said I. “
84994	85021	84990	84992	A perfect fleet	2105	” said he . Quite overpowered by the magnificence of these transactions , I asked him where the ships he insured mostly traded to at present ? “
85029	85033	85022	85022	I	0	” he replied . “
85040	85064	85034	85034	I	0	” Somehow , that pursuit seemed more in keeping with Barnard ’s Inn . I said ( in a tone of conviction ) , “
85069	85070	85034	85034	I	0	” “
85086	85087	85073	85073	I	0	” “
85095	85099	85073	85073	I	0	” I asked . “
85114	85121	85103	85103	you	0	” he asked , in reply . “
85127	85128	85103	85103	you	0	” “
85139	85156	85103	85103	you	0	” He said this with the air of one carefully reckoning up and striking a balance . “
85179	85216	85103	85103	you	0	” This certainly had not a profitable appearance , and I shook my head as if I would imply that it would be difficult to lay by much accumulative capital from such a source of income . “
85222	85227	85229	85229	you	0	” said Herbert Pocket , “
85259	85295	85254	85254	you	0	” It struck me as a singular implication that you could n’t be out of a counting - house , you know , and look about you ; but I silently deferred to his experience . “
85301	85305	85307	85307	you	0	” said Herbert , “
85351	86151	86152	86152	Mamma	2109	” This was very like his way of conducting that encounter in the garden ; very like . His manner of bearing his poverty , too , exactly corresponded to his manner of bearing that defeat . It seemed to me that he took all blows and buffets now with just the same air as he had taken mine then . It was evident that he had nothing around him but the simplest necessaries , for everything that I remarked upon turned out to have been sent in on my account from the coffee - house or somewhere else . Yet , having already made his fortune in his own mind , he was so unassuming with it that I felt quite grateful to him for not being puffed up . It was a pleasant addition to his naturally pleasant ways , and we got on famously . In the evening we went out for a walk in the streets , and went half - price to the Theatre ; and next day we went to church at Westminster Abbey , and in the afternoon we walked in the Parks ; and I wondered who shod all the horses there , and wished Joe did . On a moderate computation , it was many months , that Sunday , since I had left Joe and Biddy . The space interposed between myself and them partook of that expansion , and our marshes were any distance off . That I could have been at our old church in my old church - going clothes , on the very last Sunday that ever was , seemed a combination of impossibilities , geographical and social , solar and lunar . Yet in the London streets so crowded with people and so brilliantly lighted in the dusk of evening , there were depressing hints of reproaches for that I had put the poor old kitchen at home so far away ; and in the dead of night , the footsteps of some incapable impostor of a porter mooning about Barnard ’s Inn , under pretence of watching it , fell hollow on my heart . On the Monday morning at a quarter before nine , Herbert went to the counting - house to report himself,—to look about him , too , I suppose,—and I bore him company . He was to come away in an hour or two to attend me to Hammersmith , and I was to wait about for him . It appeared to me that the eggs from which young Insurers were hatched were incubated in dust and heat , like the eggs of ostriches , judging from the places to which those incipient giants repaired on a Monday morning . Nor did the counting - house where Herbert assisted , show in my eyes as at all a good Observatory ; being a back second floor up a yard , of a grimy presence in all particulars , and with a look into another back second floor , rather than a look out . I waited about until it was noon , and I went upon ’ Change , and I saw fluey men sitting there under the bills about shipping , whom I took to be great merchants , though I could n’t understand why they should all be out of spirits . When Herbert came , we went and had lunch at a celebrated house which I then quite venerated , but now believe to have been the most abject superstition in Europe , and where I could not help noticing , even then , that there was much more gravy on the tablecloths and knives and waiters ’ clothes , than in the steaks . This collation disposed of at a moderate price ( considering the grease , which was not charged for ) , we went back to Barnard ’s Inn and got my little portmanteau , and then took coach for Hammersmith . We arrived there at two or three o’clock in the afternoon , and had very little way to walk to Mr. Pocket ’s house . Lifting the latch of a gate , we passed direct into a little garden overlooking the river , where Mr. Pocket ’s children were playing about . And unless I deceive myself on a point where my interests or prepossessions are certainly not concerned , I saw that Mr. and Mrs. Pocket ’s children were not growing up or being brought up , but were tumbling up . Mrs. Pocket was sitting on a garden chair under a tree , reading , with her legs upon another garden chair ; and Mrs. Pocket ’s two nurse - maids were looking about them while the children played . “
86154	86158	86152	86152	Mamma	2109	” said Herbert , “
86165	86179	86162	86163	Mr. Pip	249	” Upon which Mrs. Pocket received me with an appearance of amiable dignity . “
86186	86198	86162	86163	Mr. Pip	249	” cried one of the nurses to two of the children , “
86227	86244	86222	86223	your pa	2112	” At the same time this nurse picked up Mrs. Pocket ’s handkerchief , and said , “
86259	86268	86257	86257	Mum	4953	” Upon which Mrs. Pocket laughed and said , “
86274	86327	86272	86272	Flopson	290	” and settling herself in one chair only , resumed her book . Her countenance immediately assumed a knitted and intent expression as if she had been reading for a week , but before she could have read half a dozen lines , she fixed her eyes upon me , and said , “
86336	86394	86330	86331	your mamma	2115	” This unexpected inquiry put me into such a difficulty that I began saying in the absurdest way that if there had been any such person I had no doubt she would have been quite well and would have been very much obliged and would have sent her compliments , when the nurse came to my rescue . “
86397	86408	86468	86468	Flopson	290	” she cried , picking up the pocket - handkerchief , “
86429	86464	86419	86419	you	2114	” Mrs. Pocket received her property , at first with a look of unutterable surprise as if she had never seen it before , and then with a laugh of recognition , and said , “
86470	86532	86468	86468	Flopson	290	” and forgot me , and went on reading . I found , now I had leisure to count them , that there were no fewer than six little Pockets present , in various stages of tumbling up . I had scarcely arrived at the total when a seventh was heard , as in the region of air , wailing dolefully . “
86539	86550	86555	86555	Millers	2117	” said Flopson , appearing to think it most surprising . “
86557	86761	86555	86555	Millers	2117	” Millers , who was the other nurse , retired into the house , and by degrees the child ’s wailing was hushed and stopped , as if it were a young ventriloquist with something in its mouth . Mrs. Pocket read all the time , and I was curious to know what the book could be . We were waiting , I supposed , for Mr. Pocket to come out to us ; at any rate we waited there , and so I had an opportunity of observing the remarkable family phenomenon that whenever any of the children strayed near Mrs. Pocket in their play , they always tripped themselves up and tumbled over her,—always very much to her momentary astonishment , and their own more enduring lamentation . I was at a loss to account for this surprising circumstance , and could not help giving my mind to speculations about it , until by and by Millers came down with the baby , which baby was handed to Flopson , which Flopson was handing it to Mrs. Pocket , when she too went fairly head foremost over Mrs. Pocket , baby and all , and was caught by Herbert and myself . “
86767	86780	86781	86781	everybody	725	” said Mrs. Pocket , looking off her book for a moment , “
86785	86786	86788	86788	you	0	” “
86794	86804	86792	86792	Mum	172	” returned Flopson , very red in the face ; “
86811	86812	86814	86814	I	0	” “
86821	86826	86819	86819	Flopson	290	” asked Mrs. Pocket . “
86836	86840	86833	86833	your	0	” cried Flopson . “
86872	87060	86869	86869	your	0	” Mrs. Pocket acted on the advice , and inexpertly danced the infant a little in her lap , while the other children played about it . This had lasted but a very short time , when Mrs. Pocket issued summary orders that they were all to be taken into the house for a nap . Thus I made the second discovery on that first occasion , that the nurture of the little Pockets consisted of alternately tumbling up and lying down . Under these circumstances , when Flopson and Millers had got the children into the house , like a little flock of sheep , and Mr. Pocket came out of it to make my acquaintance , I was not much surprised to find that Mr. Pocket was a gentleman with a rather perplexed expression of face , and with his very grey hair disordered on his head , as if he did n’t quite see his way to putting anything straight . Chapter XXIII . Mr. Pocket said he was glad to see me , and he hoped I was not sorry to see him . “
87068	87078	87079	87081	an alarming personage	2120	” he added , with his son ’s smile , “
87083	87184	87079	87081	an alarming personage	2120	” He was a young - looking man , in spite of his perplexities and his very grey hair , and his manner seemed quite natural . I use the word natural , in the sense of its being unaffected ; there was something comic in his distraught way , as though it would have been downright ludicrous but for his own perception that it was very near being so . When he had talked with me a little , he said to Mrs. Pocket , with a rather anxious contraction of his eyebrows , which were black and handsome , “
87195	87207	87192	87193	Mr. Pip	249	” And she looked up from her book , and said , “
87210	87649	87192	87193	Mr. Pip	249	” She then smiled upon me in an absent state of mind , and asked me if I liked the taste of orange - flower water ? As the question had no bearing , near or remote , on any foregone or subsequent transaction , I consider it to have been thrown out , like her previous approaches , in general conversational condescension . I found out within a few hours , and may mention at once , that Mrs. Pocket was the only daughter of a certain quite accidental deceased Knight , who had invented for himself a conviction that his deceased father would have been made a Baronet but for somebody ’s determined opposition arising out of entirely personal motives,—I forget whose , if I ever knew,—the Sovereign ’s , the Prime Minister ’s , the Lord Chancellor ’s , the Archbishop of Canterbury ’s , anybody’s,—and had tacked himself on to the nobles of the earth in right of this quite supposititious fact . I believe he had been knighted himself for storming the English grammar at the point of the pen , in a desperate address engrossed on vellum , on the occasion of the laying of the first stone of some building or other , and for handing some Royal Personage either the trowel or the mortar . Be that as it may , he had directed Mrs. Pocket to be brought up from her cradle as one who in the nature of things must marry a title , and who was to be guarded from the acquisition of plebeian domestic knowledge . So successful a watch and ward had been established over the young lady by this judicious parent , that she had grown up highly ornamental , but perfectly helpless and useless . With her character thus happily formed , in the first bloom of her youth she had encountered Mr. Pocket : who was also in the first bloom of youth , and not quite decided whether to mount to the Woolsack , or to roof himself in with a mitre . As his doing the one or the other was a mere question of time , he and Mrs. Pocket had taken Time by the forelock ( when , to judge from its length , it would seem to have wanted cutting ) , and had married without the knowledge of the judicious parent . The judicious parent , having nothing to bestow or withhold but his blessing , had handsomely settled that dower upon them after a short struggle , and had informed Mr. Pocket that his wife was “
87656	88182	88458	88458	ma’am	4574	” Mr. Pocket had invested the Prince ’s treasure in the ways of the world ever since , and it was supposed to have brought him in but indifferent interest . Still , Mrs. Pocket was in general the object of a queer sort of respectful pity , because she had not married a title ; while Mr. Pocket was the object of a queer sort of forgiving reproach , because he had never got one . Mr. Pocket took me into the house and showed me my room : which was a pleasant one , and so furnished as that I could use it with comfort for my own private sitting - room . He then knocked at the doors of two other similar rooms , and introduced me to their occupants , by name Drummle and Startop . Drummle , an old - looking young man of a heavy order of architecture , was whistling . Startop , younger in years and appearance , was reading and holding his head , as if he thought himself in danger of exploding it with too strong a charge of knowledge . Both Mr. and Mrs. Pocket had such a noticeable air of being in somebody else ’s hands , that I wondered who really was in possession of the house and let them live there , until I found this unknown power to be the servants . It was a smooth way of going on , perhaps , in respect of saving trouble ; but it had the appearance of being expensive , for the servants felt it a duty they owed to themselves to be nice in their eating and drinking , and to keep a deal of company downstairs . They allowed a very liberal table to Mr. and Mrs. Pocket , yet it always appeared to me that by far the best part of the house to have boarded in would have been the kitchen,—always supposing the boarder capable of self - defence , for , before I had been there a week , a neighbouring lady with whom the family were personally unacquainted , wrote in to say that she had seen Millers slapping the baby . This greatly distressed Mrs. Pocket , who burst into tears on receiving the note , and said that it was an extraordinary thing that the neighbours could n’t mind their own business . By degrees I learnt , and chiefly from Herbert , that Mr. Pocket had been educated at Harrow and at Cambridge , where he had distinguished himself ; but that when he had had the happiness of marrying Mrs. Pocket very early in life , he had impaired his prospects and taken up the calling of a Grinder . After grinding a number of dull blades,—of whom it was remarkable that their fathers , when influential , were always going to help him to preferment , but always forgot to do it when the blades had left the Grindstone,—he had wearied of that poor work and had come to London . Here , after gradually failing in loftier hopes , he had “
88184	88384	88458	88458	ma’am	4574	” with divers who had lacked opportunities or neglected them , and had refurbished divers others for special occasions , and had turned his acquirements to the account of literary compilation and correction , and on such means , added to some very moderate private resources , still maintained the house I saw . Mr. and Mrs. Pocket had a toady neighbour ; a widow lady of that highly sympathetic nature that she agreed with everybody , blessed everybody , and shed smiles and tears on everybody , according to circumstances . This lady ’s name was Mrs. Coiler , and I had the honour of taking her down to dinner on the day of my installation . She gave me to understand on the stairs , that it was a blow to dear Mrs. Pocket that dear Mr. Pocket should be under the necessity of receiving gentlemen to read with him . That did not extend to me , she told me in a gush of love and confidence ( at that time , I had known her something less than five minutes ) ; if they were all like Me , it would be quite another thing . “
88390	88395	88386	88388	dear Mrs. Pocket	287	” said Mrs. Coiler , “
88420	88421	88424	88424	ma’am	4574	” “
88426	88444	88424	88424	ma’am	4574	” I said , to stop her , for I was afraid she was going to cry . “
88454	88455	88446	88446	she	287	” “
88460	88472	88446	88446	she	287	” I said again , with the same object as before . “
88481	88486	88446	88446	she	287	” said Mrs. Coiler , “
88502	89112	88498	88500	dear Mrs. Pocket	287	” I could not help thinking that it might be harder if the butcher ’s time and attention were diverted from dear Mrs. Pocket ; but I said nothing , and indeed had enough to do in keeping a bashful watch upon my company manners . It came to my knowledge , through what passed between Mrs. Pocket and Drummle while I was attentive to my knife and fork , spoon , glasses , and other instruments of self - destruction , that Drummle , whose Christian name was Bentley , was actually the next heir but one to a baronetcy . It further appeared that the book I had seen Mrs. Pocket reading in the garden was all about titles , and that she knew the exact date at which her grandpapa would have come into the book , if he ever had come at all . Drummle did n’t say much , but in his limited way ( he struck me as a sulky kind of fellow ) he spoke as one of the elect , and recognised Mrs. Pocket as a woman and a sister . No one but themselves and Mrs. Coiler the toady neighbour showed any interest in this part of the conversation , and it appeared to me that it was painful to Herbert ; but it promised to last a long time , when the page came in with the announcement of a domestic affliction . It was , in effect , that the cook had mislaid the beef . To my unutterable amazement , I now , for the first time , saw Mr. Pocket relieve his mind by going through a performance that struck me as very extraordinary , but which made no impression on anybody else , and with which I soon became as familiar as the rest . He laid down the carving - knife and fork,—being engaged in carving , at the moment,—put his two hands into his disturbed hair , and appeared to make an extraordinary effort to lift himself up by it . When he had done this , and had not lifted himself up at all , he quietly went on with what he was about . Mrs. Coiler then changed the subject and began to flatter me . I liked it for a few moments , but she flattered me so very grossly that the pleasure was soon over . She had a serpentine way of coming close at me when she pretended to be vitally interested in the friends and localities I had left , which was altogether snaky and fork - tongued ; and when she made an occasional bounce upon Startop ( who said very little to her ) , or upon Drummle ( who said less ) , I rather envied them for being on the opposite side of the table . After dinner the children were introduced , and Mrs. Coiler made admiring comments on their eyes , noses , and legs,—a sagacious way of improving their minds . There were four little girls , and two little boys , besides the baby who might have been either , and the baby ’s next successor who was as yet neither . They were brought in by Flopson and Millers , much as though those two non - commissioned officers had been recruiting somewhere for children and had enlisted these , while Mrs. Pocket looked at the young Nobles that ought to have been as if she rather thought she had had the pleasure of inspecting them before , but did n’t quite know what to make of them . “
89127	89131	89124	89125	the baby	5736	” said Flopson . “
89149	89180	89140	89140	you	2124	” Thus advised , Mrs. Pocket took it the other way , and got its head upon the table ; which was announced to all present by a prodigious concussion . “
89192	89196	89190	89190	Mum	4953	” said Flopson ; “
89209	89514	89515	89515	You	2131	” One of the little girls , a mere mite who seemed to have prematurely taken upon herself some charge of the others , stepped out of her place by me , and danced to and from the baby until it left off crying , and laughed . Then , all the children laughed , and Mr. Pocket ( who in the meantime had twice endeavoured to lift himself up by the hair ) laughed , and we all laughed and were glad . Flopson , by dint of doubling the baby at the joints like a Dutch doll , then got it safely into Mrs. Pocket ’s lap , and gave it the nut - crackers to play with ; at the same time recommending Mrs. Pocket to take notice that the handles of that instrument were not likely to agree with its eyes , and sharply charging Miss Jane to look after the same . Then , the two nurses left the room , and had a lively scuffle on the staircase with a dissipated page who had waited at dinner , and who had clearly lost half his buttons at the gaming - table . I was made very uneasy in my mind by Mrs. Pocket ’s falling into a discussion with Drummle respecting two baronetcies , while she ate a sliced orange steeped in sugar and wine , and , forgetting all about the baby on her lap , who did most appalling things with the nut - crackers . At length little Jane , perceiving its young brains to be imperilled , softly left her place , and with many small artifices coaxed the dangerous weapon away . Mrs. Pocket finishing her orange at about the same time , and not approving of this , said to Jane , — “
89530	89531	89532	89533	Mamma dear	2133	” “
89535	89541	89542	89542	baby	5737	” lisped the little girl , “
89550	89551	89542	89542	baby	5737	” “
89559	89564	89554	89554	you	2131	” retorted Mrs. Pocket . “
89575	89601	89602	89602	Belinda	294	” Mrs. Pocket ’s dignity was so crushing , that I felt quite abashed , as if I myself had done something to rouse it . “
89604	89617	89620	89620	you	294	” remonstrated Mr. Pocket , from the other end of the table , “
89634	89635	89625	89625	Jane	289	” “
89644	89649	89636	89636	I	0	” said Mrs. Pocket . “
89667	89668	89657	89657	you	212	” “
89672	89684	89669	89670	Good God	2138	” cried Mr. Pocket , in an outbreak of desolate desperation . “
89703	89704	89705	89705	I	0	” “
89714	89729	89712	89712	Jane	289	” said Mrs. Pocket , with a majestic glance at that innocent little offender . “
89744	89769	89740	89740	Jane	289	” Mr. Pocket got his hands in his hair again , and this time really did lift himself some inches out of his chair . “
89773	89781	89740	89740	Jane	289	” he helplessly exclaimed to the elements . “
89799	89871	89872	89873	Mr. Drummle	295	” Then he let himself down again , and became silent . We all looked awkwardly at the tablecloth while this was going on . A pause succeeded , during which the honest and irrepressible baby made a series of leaps and crows at little Jane , who appeared to me to be the only member of the family ( irrespective of servants ) with whom it had any decided acquaintance . “
89875	89880	89872	89873	Mr. Drummle	295	” said Mrs. Pocket , “
89908	90398	89906	89906	ma	2146	” The baby was the soul of honour , and protested with all its might . It doubled itself up the wrong way over Mrs. Pocket ’s arm , exhibited a pair of knitted shoes and dimpled ankles to the company in lieu of its soft face , and was carried out in the highest state of mutiny . And it gained its point after all , for I saw it through the window within a few minutes , being nursed by little Jane . It happened that the other five children were left behind at the dinner - table , through Flopson ’s having some private engagement , and their not being anybody else ’s business . I thus became aware of the mutual relations between them and Mr. Pocket , which were exemplified in the following manner . Mr. Pocket , with the normal perplexity of his face heightened and his hair rumpled , looked at them for some minutes , as if he could n’t make out how they came to be boarding and lodging in that establishment , and why they had n’t been billeted by Nature on somebody else . Then , in a distant Missionary way he asked them certain questions,—as why little Joe had that hole in his frill , who said , Pa , Flopson was going to mend it when she had time,—and how little Fanny came by that whitlow , who said , Pa , Millers was going to poultice it when she did n’t forget . Then , he melted into parental tenderness , and gave them a shilling apiece and told them to go and play ; and then as they went out , with one very strong effort to lift himself up by the hair he dismissed the hopeless subject . In the evening there was rowing on the river . As Drummle and Startop had each a boat , I resolved to set up mine , and to cut them both out . I was pretty good at most exercises in which country boys are adepts , but as I was conscious of wanting elegance of style for the Thames,—not to say for other waters,—I at once engaged to place myself under the tuition of the winner of a prize - wherry who plied at our stairs , and to whom I was introduced by my new allies . This practical authority confused me very much by saying I had the arm of a blacksmith . If he could have known how nearly the compliment lost him his pupil , I doubt if he would have paid it . There was a supper - tray after we got home at night , and I think we should all have enjoyed ourselves , but for a rather disagreeable domestic occurrence . Mr. Pocket was in good spirits , when a housemaid came in , and said , “
90413	90414	90417	90418	your master	4978	” “
90420	90431	90417	90418	your master	4978	” said Mrs. Pocket , whose dignity was roused again . “
90457	90458	90445	90445	Flopson	290	” “
90465	90470	90445	90445	Flopson	290	” returned the housemaid , “
90485	90508	90483	90483	master	5014	” Hereupon , Mr. Pocket went out of the room , and we made the best of ourselves until he came back . “
90517	90532	90515	90515	Belinda	294	” said Mr. Pocket , returning with a countenance expressive of grief and despair . “
90563	90575	90535	90536	the cook	5815	” Mrs. Pocket instantly showed much amiable emotion , and said , “
90584	90585	90580	90580	Sophia	303	” “
90593	90598	90588	90588	you	294	” demanded Mr. Pocket . “
90604	90609	90599	90599	Sophia	303	” said Mrs. Pocket . “
90640	90641	90644	90644	she	303	” “
90652	90657	90644	90644	she	303	” returned Mr. Pocket , “
90669	90670	90644	90644	she	303	” “
90679	90684	90673	90673	you	2147	” said Mrs. Pocket , “
90689	90697	90673	90673	you	2147	” Mr. Pocket uttered a dismal groan . “
90712	90717	90699	90699	I	0	” said Mrs. Pocket . “
90758	90793	90748	90748	she	5815	” There was a sofa where Mr. Pocket stood , and he dropped upon it in the attitude of the Dying Gladiator . Still in that attitude he said , with a hollow voice , “
90800	90908	90748	90748	she	5815	” when I deemed it advisable to go to bed and leave him . Chapter XXIV . After two or three days , when I had established myself in my room and had gone backwards and forwards to London several times , and had ordered all I wanted of my tradesmen , Mr. Pocket and I had a long talk together . He knew more of my intended career than I knew myself , for he referred to his having been told by Mr. Jaggers that I was not designed for any profession , and that I should be well enough educated for my destiny if I could “
90912	91252	90797	90798	Mr. Pip	249	” with the average of young men in prosperous circumstances . I acquiesced , of course , knowing nothing to the contrary . He advised my attending certain places in London , for the acquisition of such mere rudiments as I wanted , and my investing him with the functions of explainer and director of all my studies . He hoped that with intelligent assistance I should meet with little to discourage me , and should soon be able to dispense with any aid but his . Through his way of saying this , and much more to similar purpose , he placed himself on confidential terms with me in an admirable manner ; and I may state at once that he was always so zealous and honourable in fulfilling his compact with me , that he made me zealous and honourable in fulfilling mine with him . If he had shown indifference as a master , I have no doubt I should have returned the compliment as a pupil ; he gave me no such excuse , and each of us did the other justice . Nor did I ever regard him as having anything ludicrous about him — or anything but what was serious , honest , and good — in his tutor communication with me . When these points were settled , and so far carried out as that I had begun to work in earnest , it occurred to me that if I could retain my bedroom in Barnard ’s Inn , my life would be agreeably varied , while my manners would be none the worse for Herbert ’s society . Mr. Pocket did not object to this arrangement , but urged that before any step could possibly be taken in it , it must be submitted to my guardian . I felt that this delicacy arose out of the consideration that the plan would save Herbert some expense , so I went off to Little Britain and imparted my wish to Mr. Jaggers . “
91264	91268	90797	90798	Mr. Pip	249	” said I , “
91285	91286	90797	90798	Mr. Pip	249	” “
91290	91300	90797	90798	Mr. Pip	249	” said Mr. Jaggers , with a short laugh . “
91317	91327	91314	91314	you	0	” I said I did n’t know how much . “
91330	91335	91314	91314	you	0	” retorted Mr. Jaggers . “
91342	91343	91314	91314	you	0	” “
91351	91352	91314	91314	you	0	” “
91356	91374	91314	91314	you	0	” said Mr. Jaggers . This was such a great fall , that I said in discomfiture , “
91381	91382	91314	91314	you	0	” “
91389	91422	91314	91314	you	0	” retorted Mr. Jaggers , lying in wait for me , with his hands in his pockets , his head on one side , and his eyes on the wall behind me ; “
91427	91428	91314	91314	you	0	” “
91438	91444	91314	91314	you	0	” said I , hesitating . “
91447	91452	91314	91314	you	0	” said Mr. Jaggers . “
91482	91492	91567	91567	I	0	” I said I thought that would do handsomely . “
91503	91512	91567	91567	I	0	” said Mr. Jaggers , knitting his brows . “
91524	91525	91517	91517	you	0	” “
91533	91534	91528	91528	I	0	” “
91537	91542	91528	91528	I	0	” said Mr. Jaggers ; “
91546	91547	91548	91548	I	0	” “
91556	91562	91550	91550	you	0	” said I , smiling . “
91575	91590	91567	91567	I	0	” observed Mr. Jaggers , with a knowing and contradictory toss of his head . “
91602	91603	91597	91597	you	638	” “
91610	91611	91597	91597	you	638	” “
91614	91624	91597	91597	you	638	” said Mr. Jaggers , opening his office door . “
91638	91754	91597	91597	you	638	” This strongly marked way of doing business made a strongly marked impression on me , and that not of an agreeable kind . Mr. Jaggers never laughed ; but he wore great bright creaking boots , and , in poising himself on these boots , with his large head bent down and his eyebrows joined together , awaiting an answer , he sometimes caused the boots to creak , as if _ they _ laughed in a dry and suspicious way . As he happened to go out now , and as Wemmick was brisk and talkative , I said to Wemmick that I hardly knew what to make of Mr. Jaggers ’s manner . “
91768	91772	91773	91773	he	249	” answered Wemmick ; “
91789	91795	91773	91773	he	249	” for I looked surprised , “
91808	91849	91862	91862	he	249	” Wemmick was at his desk , lunching — and crunching — on a dry hard biscuit ; pieces of which he threw from time to time into his slit of a mouth , as if he were posting them . “
91855	91859	91862	91862	he	249	” said Wemmick , “
91881	91905	91862	91862	he	249	” Without remarking that man - traps were not among the amenities of life , I said I supposed he was very skilful ? “
91908	91912	91862	91862	he	249	” said Wemmick , “
91916	91951	91862	91862	he	249	” Pointing with his pen at the office floor , to express that Australia was understood , for the purposes of the figure , to be symmetrically on the opposite spot of the globe . “
91958	91968	91969	91969	he	249	” added Wemmick , bringing his pen to paper , “
91974	91991	91969	91969	he	249	” Then , I said I supposed he had a fine business , and Wemmick said , “
91998	92014	91992	91996	Ca - pi - tal	305	” Then I asked if there were many clerks ? to which he replied , — “
92065	92220	92054	92054	You	2172	” I accepted the offer . When Mr. Wemmick had put all the biscuit into the post , and had paid me my money from a cash - box in a safe , the key of which safe he kept somewhere down his back and produced from his coat - collar like an iron - pigtail , we went upstairs . The house was dark and shabby , and the greasy shoulders that had left their mark in Mr. Jaggers ’s room seemed to have been shuffling up and down the staircase for years . In the front first floor , a clerk who looked something between a publican and a rat - catcher — a large pale , puffed , swollen man — was attentively engaged with three or four people of shabby appearance , whom he treated as unceremoniously as everybody seemed to be treated who contributed to Mr. Jaggers ’s coffers . “
92225	92235	92054	92054	You	2172	” said Mr. Wemmick , as we came out , “
92240	92411	92054	92054	You	2172	” In the room over that , a little flabby terrier of a clerk with dangling hair ( his cropping seemed to have been forgotten when he was a puppy ) was similarly engaged with a man with weak eyes , whom Mr. Wemmick presented to me as a smelter who kept his pot always boiling , and who would melt me anything I pleased,—and who was in an excessive white - perspiration , as if he had been trying his art on himself . In a back room , a high - shouldered man with a face - ache tied up in dirty flannel , who was dressed in old black clothes that bore the appearance of having been waxed , was stooping over his work of making fair copies of the notes of the other two gentlemen , for Mr. Jaggers ’s own use . This was all the establishment . When we went downstairs again , Wemmick led me into my guardian ’s room , and said , “
92418	92419	92054	92054	You	2172	” “
92422	92442	92054	92054	You	2172	” said I , as the two odious casts with the twitchy leer upon them caught my sight again , “
92448	92449	92054	92054	You	2172	” “
92452	92474	92054	92054	You	2172	” said Wemmick , getting upon a chair , and blowing the dust off the horrible heads before bringing them down . “
92547	92548	92552	92552	him	2178	” “
92554	92578	92580	92580	him	2178	” I asked , recoiling from the brute , as Wemmick spat upon his eyebrow and gave it a rub with his sleeve . “
92618	92652	92615	92616	Old Artful	306	” said Wemmick . He then explained this affectionate apostrophe , by touching his brooch representing the lady and the weeping willow at the tomb with the urn upon it , and saying , “
92661	92662	92615	92616	Old Artful	306	” “
92668	92671	92615	92616	Old Artful	306	” said I. “
92674	92678	92615	92616	Old Artful	306	” returned Wemmick . “
92747	92774	92835	92835	he	2178	” Wemmick ’s attention being thus directed to his brooch , he put down the cast , and polished the brooch with his pocket - handkerchief . “
92785	92789	92790	92790	He	2178	” I asked . “
92796	92797	92790	92790	He	2178	” “
92802	92806	92798	92798	You	2174	” said Wemmick ; “
92880	92889	92891	92891	you	2174	” ( Mr. Wemmick was again apostrophising ) , “
92917	92939	92915	92915	you	2174	” Before putting his late friend on his shelf again , Wemmick touched the largest of his mourning rings and said , “
92953	93016	92915	92915	you	2174	” While he was putting up the other cast and coming down from the chair , the thought crossed my mind that all his personal jewelry was derived from like sources . As he had shown no diffidence on the subject , I ventured on the liberty of asking him the question , when he stood before me , dusting his hands . “
93020	93024	92915	92915	you	2174	” he returned , “
93110	93132	93095	93095	my	0	” When I had rendered homage to this light , he went on to say , in a friendly manner : — “
93213	93225	93199	93199	I	0	” I said I should be delighted to accept his hospitality . “
93228	93232	93199	93199	I	0	” said he ; “
93257	93258	93250	93250	you	2174	” “
93262	93263	93271	93271	he	245	” “
93266	93270	93271	93271	he	245	” said Wemmick , “
93314	93315	93311	93312	his housekeeper	2194	” “
93323	93324	93317	93317	I	0	” “
93327	93331	93332	93332	you	2174	” said Wemmick , “
93387	93429	93382	93382	your	2174	” I told him I would do so , with all the interest and curiosity that his preparation awakened . As I was taking my departure , he asked me if I would like to devote five minutes to seeing Mr. Jaggers “
93433	93455	93382	93382	your	2174	” For several reasons , and not least because I did n’t clearly know what Mr. Jaggers would be found to be “
93458	93567	93382	93382	your	2174	” I replied in the affirmative . We dived into the City , and came up in a crowded police - court , where a blood - relation ( in the murderous sense ) of the deceased , with the fanciful taste in brooches , was standing at the bar , uncomfortably chewing something ; while my guardian had a woman under examination or cross - examination,—I do n’t know which,—and was striking her , and the bench , and everybody present , with awe . If anybody , of whatsoever degree , said a word that he did n’t approve of , he instantly required to have it “
93571	93583	93584	93584	I	0	” If anybody would n’t make an admission , he said , “
93592	93603	93584	93584	I	0	” and if anybody made an admission , he said , “
93610	93931	93940	93940	her	2197	” The magistrates shivered under a single bite of his finger . Thieves and thief - takers hung in dread rapture on his words , and shrank when a hair of his eyebrows turned in their direction . Which side he was on I could n’t make out , for he seemed to me to be grinding the whole place in a mill ; I only know that when I stole out on tiptoe , he was not on the side of the bench ; for , he was making the legs of the old gentleman who presided , quite convulsive under the table , by his denunciations of his conduct as the representative of British law and justice in that chair that day . Chapter XXV . Bentley Drummle , who was so sulky a fellow that he even took up a book as if its writer had done him an injury , did not take up an acquaintance in a more agreeable spirit . Heavy in figure , movement , and comprehension,—in the sluggish complexion of his face , and in the large , awkward tongue that seemed to loll about in his mouth as he himself lolled about in a room,—he was idle , proud , niggardly , reserved , and suspicious . He came of rich people down in Somersetshire , who had nursed this combination of qualities until they made the discovery that it was just of age and a blockhead . Thus , Bentley Drummle had come to Mr. Pocket when he was a head taller than that gentleman , and half a dozen heads thicker than most gentlemen . Startop had been spoilt by a weak mother and kept at home when he ought to have been at school , but he was devotedly attached to her , and admired her beyond measure . He had a woman ’s delicacy of feature , and was—“as
93942	93946	93940	93940	her	2197	” said Herbert to me—“exactly
93951	94535	93940	93940	her	2197	” It was but natural that I should take to him much more kindly than to Drummle , and that , even in the earliest evenings of our boating , he and I should pull homeward abreast of one another , conversing from boat to boat , while Bentley Drummle came up in our wake alone , under the overhanging banks and among the rushes . He would always creep in - shore like some uncomfortable amphibious creature , even when the tide would have sent him fast upon his way ; and I always think of him as coming after us in the dark or by the back - water , when our own two boats were breaking the sunset or the moonlight in mid - stream . Herbert was my intimate companion and friend . I presented him with a half - share in my boat , which was the occasion of his often coming down to Hammersmith ; and my possession of a half - share in his chambers often took me up to London . We used to walk between the two places at all hours . I have an affection for the road yet ( though it is not so pleasant a road as it was then ) , formed in the impressibility of untried youth and hope . When I had been in Mr. Pocket ’s family a month or two , Mr. and Mrs. Camilla turned up . Camilla was Mr. Pocket ’s sister . Georgiana , whom I had seen at Miss Havisham ’s on the same occasion , also turned up . She was a cousin,—an indigestive single woman , who called her rigidity religion , and her liver love . These people hated me with the hatred of cupidity and disappointment . As a matter of course , they fawned upon me in my prosperity with the basest meanness . Towards Mr. Pocket , as a grown - up infant with no notion of his own interests , they showed the complacent forbearance I had heard them express . Mrs. Pocket they held in contempt ; but they allowed the poor soul to have been heavily disappointed in life , because that shed a feeble reflected light upon themselves . These were the surroundings among which I settled down , and applied myself to my education . I soon contracted expensive habits , and began to spend an amount of money that within a few short months I should have thought almost fabulous ; but through good and evil I stuck to my books . There was no other merit in this , than my having sense enough to feel my deficiencies . Between Mr. Pocket and Herbert I got on fast ; and , with one or the other always at my elbow to give me the start I wanted , and clear obstructions out of my road , I must have been as great a dolt as Drummle if I had done less . I had not seen Mr. Wemmick for some weeks , when I thought I would write him a note and propose to go home with him on a certain evening . He replied that it would give him much pleasure , and that he would expect me at the office at six o’clock . Thither I went , and there I found him , putting the key of his safe down his back as the clock struck . “
94545	94549	94537	94537	you	2199	” said he . “
94552	94556	94537	94537	you	2199	” said I , “
94561	94562	94537	94537	you	2199	” “
94566	94572	94537	94537	you	2199	” was Wemmick ’s reply , “
94676	94710	94673	94673	I	0	“ Pick us out a good one , old Briton , because if we had chosen to keep you in the box another day or two , we could easily have done it . ”
94716	94731	94711	94711	He	2200	“ Let me make you a present of the best fowl in the shop . ”
94763	94779	94751	94751	You	0	” I really thought he was still speaking of the fowl , until he added , “
94791	94799	94784	94786	an aged parent	2207	” I then said what politeness required . “
94811	94820	94807	94808	Mr. Jaggers	245	” he pursued , as we walked along . “
94824	94825	94826	94826	He	245	” “
94868	94889	94850	94850	He	245	” Although I was not in the habit of counting Drummle as one of my intimate associates , I answered , “
94892	94893	94850	94850	He	245	” “
94903	94909	94911	94911	he	245	gang,”—I hardly felt complimented by the word,—“and
94944	94964	94965	94965	he	245	” proceeded Wemmick , after a moment ’s pause , as if the remark followed on the housekeeper understood ; “
94977	94978	94965	94965	he	245	” “
94984	94985	94965	94965	he	245	” “
94990	94994	94995	94995	He	245	” returned Wemmick . “
95004	95018	94995	94995	He	245	“ I want to see the man who ’ll rob _ me _ . ”
95048	95084	95036	95036	him	245	“ You know where I live ; now , no bolt is ever drawn there ; why do n’t you do a stroke of business with me ? Come ; ca n’t I tempt you ? ”
95107	95108	95109	95109	They	2219	” “
95115	95118	95109	95109	They	2219	” said I. “
95122	95126	95127	95127	I	0	” said Wemmick . “
95159	95160	95183	95183	he	245	” “
95168	95172	95175	95175	they	2219	” I observed , “
95177	95178	95175	95175	they	2219	” “
95189	95197	95183	95183	he	245	” said Wemmick , cutting me short , “
95245	95262	95238	95238	he	245	” I was falling into meditation on my guardian ’s greatness , when Wemmick remarked : — “
95306	95307	95296	95296	his	245	” “
95313	95316	95296	95296	his	245	” said I. “
95319	95323	95324	95324	I	0	” repeated Wemmick . “
95410	95515	95516	95516	My	0	” At first with such discourse , and afterwards with conversation of a more general nature , did Mr. Wemmick and I beguile the time and the road , until he gave me to understand that we had arrived in the district of Walworth . It appeared to be a collection of back lanes , ditches , and little gardens , and to present the aspect of a rather dull retirement . Wemmick ’s house was a little wooden cottage in the midst of plots of garden , and the top of it was cut out and painted like a battery mounted with guns . “
95520	95524	95516	95516	My	0	” said Wemmick . “
95532	95577	95516	95516	My	0	” I highly commended it , I think it was the smallest house I ever saw ; with the queerest gothic windows ( by far the greater part of them sham ) , and a gothic door almost too small to get in at . “
95587	95591	95516	95516	My	0	” said Wemmick , “
95626	95680	95613	95613	I	0	” The bridge was a plank , and it crossed a chasm about four feet wide and two deep . But it was very pleasant to see the pride with which he hoisted it up and made it fast ; smiling as he did so , with a relish and not merely mechanically . “
95690	95694	95613	95613	I	0	” said Wemmick , “
95723	95763	95715	95715	you	2232	” The piece of ordnance referred to , was mounted in a separate fortress , constructed of lattice - work . It was protected from the weather by an ingenious little tarpaulin contrivance in the nature of an umbrella . “
95770	95774	95715	95715	you	2232	” said Wemmick , “
95817	95823	95814	95814	your	2232	” I said , decidedly . “
95877	95894	95875	95875	sir	4442	” said Wemmick , smiling again , but seriously too , as he shook his head , “
95918	96051	96052	96052	I	0	” Then , he conducted me to a bower about a dozen yards off , but which was approached by such ingenious twists of path that it took quite a long time to get at ; and in this retreat our glasses were already set forth . Our punch was cooling in an ornamental lake , on whose margin the bower was raised . This piece of water ( with an island in the middle which might have been the salad for supper ) was of a circular form , and he had constructed a fountain in it , which , when you set a little mill going and took a cork out of a pipe , played to that powerful extent that it made the back of your hand quite wet . “
96081	96090	96074	96079	my own Jack of all Trades	2242	” said Wemmick , in acknowledging my compliments . “
96136	96184	96185	96187	Well aged parent	2245	” I expressed the readiness I felt , and we went into the castle . There we found , sitting by a fire , a very old man in a flannel coat : clean , cheerful , comfortable , and well cared for , but intensely deaf . “
96189	96204	96185	96187	Well aged parent	2245	” said Wemmick , shaking hands with him in a cordial and jocose way , “
96209	96210	96207	96207	you	2245	” “
96219	96225	96214	96214	John	310	” replied the old man . “
96234	96238	96228	96229	Mr. Pip	249	” said Wemmick , “
96274	96275	96268	96268	you	2245	” “
96288	96304	96286	96286	sir	4442	” cried the old man , while I nodded as hard as I possibly could . “
96344	96345	96346	96346	You	2245	” “
96361	96377	96359	96359	Aged	2255	” said Wemmick , contemplating the old man , with his hard face really softened ; “
96387	96394	96359	96359	Aged	2255	” giving him a tremendous one ; “
96403	96412	96413	96413	you	2245	” giving him a still more tremendous one ; “
96455	96522	96446	96446	You	2245	” I tipped him several more , and he was in great spirits . We left him bestirring himself to feed the fowls , and we sat down to our punch in the arbour ; where Wemmick told me , as he smoked a pipe , that it had taken him a good many years to bring the property up to its present pitch of perfection . “
96531	96532	96528	96529	Mr. Wemmick	269	” “
96536	96540	96528	96529	Mr. Wemmick	269	” said Wemmick , “
96562	96563	96560	96560	George	236	” “
96575	96576	96570	96571	Mr. Jaggers	245	” “
96581	96585	96570	96571	Mr. Jaggers	245	” said Wemmick . “
96673	96710	96664	96664	I	0	” Of course I felt my good faith involved in the observance of his request . The punch being very nice , we sat there drinking it and talking , until it was almost nine o’clock . “
96717	96729	96664	96664	I	0	” said Wemmick then , as he laid down his pipe ; “
96737	96875	96732	96733	the Aged	2243	” Proceeding into the Castle again , we found the Aged heating the poker , with expectant eyes , as a preliminary to the performance of this great nightly ceremony . Wemmick stood with his watch in his hand until the moment was come for him to take the red - hot poker from the Aged , and repair to the battery . He took it , and went out , and presently the Stinger went off with a Bang that shook the crazy little box of a cottage as if it must fall to pieces , and made every glass and teacup in it ring . Upon this , the Aged — who I believe would have been blown out of his arm - chair but for holding on by the elbows — cried out exultingly , “
96884	96979	96880	96880	I	0	” and I nodded at the old gentleman until it is no figure of speech to declare that I absolutely could not see him . The interval between that time and supper Wemmick devoted to showing me his collection of curiosities . They were mostly of a felonious character ; comprising the pen with which a celebrated forgery had been committed , a distinguished razor or two , some locks of hair , and several manuscript confessions written under condemnation,—upon which Mr. Wemmick set particular value as being , to use his own words , “
96988	97472	96986	96986	sir	4442	” These were agreeably dispersed among small specimens of china and glass , various neat trifles made by the proprietor of the museum , and some tobacco - stoppers carved by the Aged . They were all displayed in that chamber of the Castle into which I had been first inducted , and which served , not only as the general sitting - room but as the kitchen too , if I might judge from a saucepan on the hob , and a brazen bijou over the fireplace designed for the suspension of a roasting - jack . There was a neat little girl in attendance , who looked after the Aged in the day . When she had laid the supper - cloth , the bridge was lowered to give her means of egress , and she withdrew for the night . The supper was excellent ; and though the Castle was rather subject to dry - rot insomuch that it tasted like a bad nut , and though the pig might have been farther off , I was heartily pleased with my whole entertainment . Nor was there any drawback on my little turret bedroom , beyond there being such a very thin ceiling between me and the flagstaff , that when I lay down on my back in bed , it seemed as if I had to balance that pole on my forehead all night . Wemmick was up early in the morning , and I am afraid I heard him cleaning my boots . After that , he fell to gardening , and I saw him from my gothic window pretending to employ the Aged , and nodding at him in a most devoted manner . Our breakfast was as good as the supper , and at half - past eight precisely we started for Little Britain . By degrees , Wemmick got dryer and harder as we went along , and his mouth tightened into a post - office again . At last , when we got to his place of business and he pulled out his key from his coat - collar , he looked as unconscious of his Walworth property as if the Castle and the drawbridge and the arbour and the lake and the fountain and the Aged , had all been blown into space together by the last discharge of the Stinger . Chapter XXVI . It fell out as Wemmick had told me it would , that I had an early opportunity of comparing my guardian ’s establishment with that of his cashier and clerk . My guardian was in his room , washing his hands with his scented soap , when I went into the office from Walworth ; and he called me to him , and gave me the invitation for myself and friends which Wemmick had prepared me to receive . “
97476	97480	96986	96986	sir	4442	” he stipulated , “
97492	97532	96986	96986	sir	4442	” I asked him where we should come to ( for I had no idea where he lived ) , and I believe it was in his general objection to make anything like an admission , that he replied , “
97545	98234	98235	98235	Pip	249	” I embrace this opportunity of remarking that he washed his clients off , as if he were a surgeon or a dentist . He had a closet in his room , fitted up for the purpose , which smelt of the scented soap like a perfumer ’s shop . It had an unusually large jack - towel on a roller inside the door , and he would wash his hands , and wipe them and dry them all over this towel , whenever he came in from a police court or dismissed a client from his room . When I and my friends repaired to him at six o’clock next day , he seemed to have been engaged on a case of a darker complexion than usual , for we found him with his head butted into this closet , not only washing his hands , but laving his face and gargling his throat . And even when he had done all that , and had gone all round the jack - towel , he took out his penknife and scraped the case out of his nails before he put his coat on . There were some people slinking about as usual when we passed out into the street , who were evidently anxious to speak with him ; but there was something so conclusive in the halo of scented soap which encircled his presence , that they gave it up for that day . As we walked along westward , he was recognised ever and again by some face in the crowd of the streets , and whenever that happened he talked louder to me ; but he never otherwise recognised anybody , or took notice that anybody recognised him . He conducted us to Gerrard Street , Soho , to a house on the south side of that street . Rather a stately house of its kind , but dolefully in want of painting , and with dirty windows . He took out his key and opened the door , and we all went into a stone hall , bare , gloomy , and little used . So , up a dark brown staircase into a series of three dark brown rooms on the first floor . There were carved garlands on the panelled walls , and as he stood among them giving us welcome , I know what kind of loops I thought they looked like . Dinner was laid in the best of these rooms ; the second was his dressing - room ; the third , his bedroom . He told us that he held the whole house , but rarely used more of it than we saw . The table was comfortably laid — no silver in the service , of course — and at the side of his chair was a capacious dumb - waiter , with a variety of bottles and decanters on it , and four dishes of fruit for dessert . I noticed throughout , that he kept everything under his own hand , and distributed everything himself . There was a bookcase in the room ; I saw from the backs of the books , that they were about evidence , criminal law , criminal biography , trials , acts of Parliament , and such things . The furniture was all very solid and good , like his watch - chain . It had an official look , however , and there was nothing merely ornamental to be seen . In a corner was a little table of papers with a shaded lamp : so that he seemed to bring the office home with him in that respect too , and to wheel it out of an evening and fall to work . As he had scarcely seen my three companions until now,—for he and I had walked together,—he stood on the hearth - rug , after ringing the bell , and took a searching look at them . To my surprise , he seemed at once to be principally if not solely interested in Drummle . “
98237	98255	98235	98235	Pip	249	” said he , putting his large hand on my shoulder and moving me to the window , “
98270	98271	98267	98268	the Spider	312	” “
98275	98278	98279	98285	The blotchy , sprawly , sulky fellow	2268	” said I. “
98287	98288	98279	98285	The blotchy , sprawly , sulky fellow	2268	” “
98294	98298	98291	98292	Bentley Drummle	298	” I replied ; “
98308	98315	98316	98321	the one with the delicate face	2269	” Not making the least account of “
98323	98327	98316	98321	the one with the delicate face	2269	” he returned , “
98345	99231	98342	98343	that fellow	2271	” He immediately began to talk to Drummle : not at all deterred by his replying in his heavy reticent way , but apparently led on by it to screw discourse out of him . I was looking at the two , when there came between me and them the housekeeper , with the first dish for the table . She was a woman of about forty , I supposed,—but I may have thought her younger than she was . Rather tall , of a lithe nimble figure , extremely pale , with large faded eyes , and a quantity of streaming hair . I can not say whether any diseased affection of the heart caused her lips to be parted as if she were panting , and her face to bear a curious expression of suddenness and flutter ; but I know that I had been to see Macbeth at the theatre , a night or two before , and that her face looked to me as if it were all disturbed by fiery air , like the faces I had seen rise out of the Witches ’ caldron . She set the dish on , touched my guardian quietly on the arm with a finger to notify that dinner was ready , and vanished . We took our seats at the round table , and my guardian kept Drummle on one side of him , while Startop sat on the other . It was a noble dish of fish that the housekeeper had put on table , and we had a joint of equally choice mutton afterwards , and then an equally choice bird . Sauces , wines , all the accessories we wanted , and all of the best , were given out by our host from his dumb - waiter ; and when they had made the circuit of the table , he always put them back again . Similarly , he dealt us clean plates and knives and forks , for each course , and dropped those just disused into two baskets on the ground by his chair . No other attendant than the housekeeper appeared . She set on every dish ; and I always saw in her face , a face rising out of the caldron . Years afterwards , I made a dreadful likeness of that woman , by causing a face that had no other natural resemblance to it than it derived from flowing hair to pass behind a bowl of flaming spirits in a dark room . Induced to take particular notice of the housekeeper , both by her own striking appearance and by Wemmick ’s preparation , I observed that whenever she was in the room she kept her eyes attentively on my guardian , and that she would remove her hands from any dish she put before him , hesitatingly , as if she dreaded his calling her back , and wanted him to speak when she was nigh , if he had anything to say . I fancied that I could detect in his manner a consciousness of this , and a purpose of always holding her in suspense . Dinner went off gayly , and although my guardian seemed to follow rather than originate subjects , I knew that he wrenched the weakest part of our dispositions out of us . For myself , I found that I was expressing my tendency to lavish expenditure , and to patronise Herbert , and to boast of my great prospects , before I quite knew that I had opened my lips . It was so with all of us , but with no one more than Drummle : the development of whose inclination to gird in a grudging and suspicious way at the rest , was screwed out of him before the fish was taken off . It was not then , but when we had got to the cheese , that our conversation turned upon our rowing feats , and that Drummle was rallied for coming up behind of a night in that slow amphibious way of his . Drummle upon this , informed our host that he much preferred our room to our company , and that as to skill he was more than our master , and that as to strength he could scatter us like chaff . By some invisible agency , my guardian wound him up to a pitch little short of ferocity about this trifle ; and he fell to baring and spanning his arm to show how muscular it was , and we all fell to baring and spanning our arms in a ridiculous manner . Now the housekeeper was at that time clearing the table ; my guardian , taking no heed of her , but with the side of his face turned from her , was leaning back in his chair biting the side of his forefinger and showing an interest in Drummle , that , to me , was quite inexplicable . Suddenly , he clapped his large hand on the housekeeper ’s , like a trap , as she stretched it across the table . So suddenly and smartly did he do this , that we all stopped in our foolish contention . “
99238	99243	99233	99233	you	2272	” said Mr. Jaggers , “
99259	99280	99281	99281	Master	5014	” Her entrapped hand was on the table , but she had already put her other hand behind her waist . “
99283	99302	99281	99281	Master	5014	” she said , in a low voice , with her eyes attentively and entreatingly fixed upon him . “
99306	99307	99281	99281	Master	5014	” “
99315	99328	99329	99329	Molly	315	” repeated Mr. Jaggers , with an immovable determination to show it . “
99337	99338	99339	99339	Master	5014	” “
99341	99346	99339	99339	Master	5014	” she again murmured . “
99349	99350	99351	99351	Molly	315	” “
99353	99374	99351	99351	Molly	315	” said Mr. Jaggers , not looking at her , but obstinately looking at the opposite side of the room , “
99389	99466	99351	99351	Molly	315	” He took his hand from hers , and turned that wrist up on the table . She brought her other hand from behind her , and held the two out side by side . The last wrist was much disfigured,—deeply scarred and scarred across and across . When she held her hands out she took her eyes from Mr. Jaggers , and turned them watchfully on every one of the rest of us in succession . “
99472	99486	99487	99489	Very few men	2277	” said Mr. Jaggers , coolly tracing out the sinews with his forefinger . “
99541	99581	99586	99586	Molly	315	” While he said these words in a leisurely , critical style , she continued to look at every one of us in regular succession as we sat . The moment he ceased , she looked at him again . “
99588	99599	99586	99586	Molly	315	” said Mr. Jaggers , giving her a slight nod ; “
99609	99644	99586	99586	Molly	315	” She withdrew her hands and went out of the room , and Mr. Jaggers , putting the decanters on from his dumb - waiter , filled his glass and passed round the wine . “
99653	99657	99586	99586	Molly	315	” said he , “
99688	99853	99683	99683	I	0	” If his object in singling out Drummle were to bring him out still more , it perfectly succeeded . In a sulky triumph , Drummle showed his morose depreciation of the rest of us , in a more and more offensive degree , until he became downright intolerable . Through all his stages , Mr. Jaggers followed him with the same strange interest . He actually seemed to serve as a zest to Mr. Jaggers ’s wine . In our boyish want of discretion I dare say we took too much to drink , and I know we talked too much . We became particularly hot upon some boorish sneer of Drummle ’s , to the effect that we were too free with our money . It led to my remarking , with more zeal than discretion , that it came with a bad grace from him , to whom Startop had lent money in my presence but a week or so before . “
99856	99860	99905	99905	You	2284	” retorted Drummle ; “
99866	99867	99868	99868	I	0	” “
99879	99883	99875	99875	he	2284	” said I , “
99902	99903	99905	99905	You	2284	” “
99910	99914	99905	99905	You	2284	” retorted Drummle . “
99918	99919	99905	99905	You	2284	” “
99924	99935	99905	99905	You	2284	” I went on , meaning to be very severe , “
99951	99952	99937	99937	you	2284	” “
99957	99961	99953	99953	You	2284	” said Drummle . “
99980	99981	99972	99972	I	0	” “
99994	99995	99990	99990	I	0	” “
100002	100006	99997	99997	You	2284	” repeated Drummle . “
100010	100045	99997	99997	You	2284	” This was so very aggravating — the more especially as I found myself making no way against his surly obtuseness — that I said , disregarding Herbert ’s efforts to check me , — “
100076	100077	100079	100079	I	0	” “
100094	100120	100079	100079	I	0	” growled Drummle . And I think he added in a lower growl , that we might both go to the devil and shake ourselves . “
100128	100132	100121	100121	I	0	” said I , “
100173	100368	100157	100157	you	295	” Drummle laughed outright , and sat laughing in our faces , with his hands in his pockets and his round shoulders raised ; plainly signifying that it was quite true , and that he despised us as asses all . Hereupon Startop took him in hand , though with a much better grace than I had shown , and exhorted him to be a little more agreeable . Startop , being a lively , bright young fellow , and Drummle being the exact opposite , the latter was always disposed to resent him as a direct personal affront . He now retorted in a coarse , lumpish way , and Startop tried to turn the discussion aside with some small pleasantry that made us all laugh . Resenting this little success more than anything , Drummle , without any threat or warning , pulled his hands out of his pockets , dropped his round shoulders , swore , took up a large glass , and would have flung it at his adversary ’s head , but for our entertainer ’s dexterously seizing it at the instant when it was raised for that purpose . “
100371	100393	100369	100369	Gentlemen	4867	” said Mr. Jaggers , deliberately putting down the glass , and hauling out his gold repeater by its massive chain , “
100407	100430	100431	100432	old boy	2290	” On this hint we all rose to depart . Before we got to the street door , Startop was cheerily calling Drummle “
100434	100602	100431	100432	old boy	2290	” as if nothing had happened . But the old boy was so far from responding , that he would not even walk to Hammersmith on the same side of the way ; so Herbert and I , who remained in town , saw them going down the street on opposite sides ; Startop leading , and Drummle lagging behind in the shadow of the houses , much as he was wo nt to follow in his boat . As the door was not yet shut , I thought I would leave Herbert there for a moment , and run upstairs again to say a word to my guardian . I found him in his dressing - room surrounded by his stock of boots , already hard at it , washing his hands of us . I told him I had come up again to say how sorry I was that anything disagreeable should have occurred , and that I hoped he would not blame me much . “
100605	100621	100626	100626	Pip	249	” said he , sluicing his face , and speaking through the water - drops ; “
100634	100655	100631	100631	Spider	312	” He had turned towards me now , and was shaking his head , and blowing , and towelling himself . “
100665	100667	100668	100668	I	0	” said I—“but
100672	100673	100668	100668	I	0	” “
100678	100683	100668	100668	I	0	” my guardian assented ; “

100751	100773	100743	100743	I	0	” he said , letting his head drop into a festoon of towel , and towelling away at his two ears . “

100796	100841	100842	100842	MY	0	” In about a month after that , the Spider ’s time with Mr. Pocket was up for good , and , to the great relief of all the house but Mrs. Pocket , he went home to the family hole . Chapter XXVII . “
100848	100967	100844	100845	MR PIP	249	“ I write this by request of Mr. Gargery , for to let you know that he is going to London in company with Mr. Wopsle and would be glad if agreeable to be allowed to see you . He would call at Barnard ’s Hotel Tuesday morning at nine o’clock , when if not agreeable please leave word . Your poor sister is much the same as when you left . We talk of you in the kitchen every night , and wonder what you are saying and doing . If now considered in the light of a liberty , excuse it for the love of poor old days .

I hope and do not doubt it will be agreeable to see him , even though a gentleman , for you had ever a good heart , and he is a worthy , worthy man .

It ai n’t that I am proud , but that I want to be right , as you shall never see me no more in these clothes . I ’m wrong in these clothes . I ’m wrong out of the forge , the kitchen , or off th ’ meshes . You wo n’t find half so much fault in me if you think of me in my forge dress , with my hammer in my hand , or even my pipe . You wo n’t find half so much fault in me if , supposing as you should ever wish to see me , you come and put your head in at the forge window and see Joe the blacksmith , there , at the old anvil , in the old burnt apron , sticking to the old work . I ’m awful dull , but I hope I ’ve beat out something nigh the rights of this at last . And so GOD bless you , dear old Pip , old chap , GOD bless you ! ”

You have always adored her , ever since I have known you . You brought your adoration and your portmanteau here together . Told me ! Why , you have always told me all day long . When you told me your own story , you told me plainly that you began adoring her the first time you saw her , when you were very young indeed . ”

115631	115709	115542	115542	I	0	“ — Then , my dear Herbert , I can not tell you how dependent and uncertain I feel , and how exposed to hundreds of chances . Avoiding forbidden ground , as you did just now , I may still say that on the constancy of one person ( naming no person ) all my expectations depend . And at the best , how indefinite and unsatisfactory , only to know so vaguely what they are ! ”

Likewise , it seems to me that , concentrating our attention on the examination , we altogether overlook one of the best points of the animal . Did n’t you tell me that your guardian , Mr. Jaggers , told you in the beginning , that you were not endowed with expectations only ? And even if he had not told you so,—though that is a very large If , I grant,—could you believe that of all men in London , Mr. Jaggers is the man to hold his present relations towards you unless he were sure of his ground ? ”

You ’ll be one - and - twenty before you know where you are , and then perhaps you ’ll get some further enlightenment . At all events , you ’ll be nearer getting it , for it must come at last . ”

Am I right in so understanding what you have told me , as that he never referred to her , directly or indirectly , in any way ? Never even hinted , for instance , that your patron might have views as to your marriage ultimately ? ”

Gravely , Handel , for the subject is grave enough , you know how it is as well as I do . I suppose there was a time once when my father had not given matters up ; but if ever there was , the time is gone . May I ask you if you have ever had an opportunity of remarking , down in your part of the country , that the children of not exactly suitable marriages are always most particularly anxious to be married ? ”

My poor sister Charlotte , who was next me and died before she was fourteen , was a striking example . Little Jane is the same . In her desire to be matrimonially established , you might suppose her to have passed her short existence in the perpetual contemplation of domestic bliss . Little Alick in a frock has already made arrangements for his union with a suitable young person at Kew . And indeed , I think we are all engaged , except the baby . ”

119820	119828	119817	119817	I	0	“ He was drunk , no doubt . ”
119829	119836	119838	119839	Mr. Wopsle	167	“ O dear no , sir , ”
119841	119864	119838	119839	Mr. Wopsle	167	“ not drunk . His employer would see to that , sir . His employer would not allow him to be drunk . ”
119865	119871	119873	119875	I. Mr. Wopsle	167	“ You know his employer ? ”
119891	119899	119901	119901	he	167	“ You must have observed , gentlemen , ”
119903	119963	119901	119901	he	167	“ an ignorant and a blatant ass , with a rasping throat and a countenance expressive of low malignity , who went through — I will not say sustained — the rôle ( if I may use a French expression ) of Claudius , King of Denmark . That is his employer , gentlemen . Such is the profession ! ”
120278	120329	120330	120330	Yours	2723	“ I am to come to London the day after to - morrow by the midday coach . I believe it was settled you should meet me ? At all events Miss Havisham has that impression , and I write in obedience to it . She sends you her regard . “
120334	120496	120332	120332	ESTELLA	196	” If there had been time , I should probably have ordered several suits of clothes for this occasion ; but as there was not , I was fain to be content with those I had . My appetite vanished instantly , and I knew no peace or rest until the day arrived . Not that its arrival brought me either ; for , then I was worse than ever , and began haunting the coach - office in Wood Street , Cheapside , before the coach had left the Blue Boar in our town . For all that I knew this perfectly well , I still felt as if it were not safe to let the coach - office be out of my sight longer than five minutes at a time ; and in this condition of unreason I had performed the first half - hour of a watch of four or five hours , when Wemmick ran against me . “
120502	120506	120499	120500	Mr. Pip	249	” said he ; “
120524	120551	120520	120520	your	249	” I explained that I was waiting to meet somebody who was coming up by coach , and I inquired after the Castle and the Aged . “
120556	120560	120563	120564	the Aged	261	” said Wemmick , “
120628	120629	120621	120621	you	249	” “
120634	120646	120621	120621	you	249	” said I , for he was tending in that direction . “
120652	120656	120621	120621	you	249	” returned Wemmick , “
120703	120704	120700	120701	our client	2728	” “
120712	120716	120700	120701	our client	2728	” I asked . “
120725	120732	120700	120701	our client	2728	” answered Wemmick , very drily . “
120759	120760	120756	120756	you	0	” “
120767	120771	120772	120772	Yah	2730	” I remarked . “
120774	120787	120772	120772	Yah	2730	” said Wemmick , touching me on the breast with his forefinger ; “
120813	121138	120808	120808	you	0	” I had so much time to spare , that the proposal came as a relief , notwithstanding its irreconcilability with my latent desire to keep my eye on the coach - office . Muttering that I would make the inquiry whether I had time to walk with him , I went into the office , and ascertained from the clerk with the nicest precision and much to the trying of his temper , the earliest moment at which the coach could be expected,—which I knew beforehand , quite as well as he . I then rejoined Mr. Wemmick , and affecting to consult my watch , and to be surprised by the information I had received , accepted his offer . We were at Newgate in a few minutes , and we passed through the lodge where some fetters were hanging up on the bare walls among the prison rules , into the interior of the jail . At that time jails were much neglected , and the period of exaggerated reaction consequent on all public wrongdoing — and which is always its heaviest and longest punishment — was still far off . So , felons were not lodged and fed better than soldiers ( to say nothing of paupers ) , and seldom set fire to their prisons with the excusable object of improving the flavour of their soup . It was visiting time when Wemmick took me in , and a potman was going his rounds with beer ; and the prisoners , behind bars in yards , were buying beer , and talking to friends ; and a frowzy , ugly , disorderly , depressing scene it was . It struck me that Wemmick walked among the prisoners much as a gardener might walk among his plants . This was first put into my head by his seeing a shoot that had come up in the night , and saying , “
121154	121158	121141	121142	Captain Tom	211	” and also , “
121184	121360	121168	121168	I	0	” Equally in his stopping at the bars and attending to anxious whisperers,—always singly,—Wemmick with his post - office in an immovable state , looked at them while in conference , as if he were taking particular notice of the advance they had made , since last observed , towards coming out in full blow at their trial . He was highly popular , and I found that he took the familiar department of Mr. Jaggers ’s business ; though something of the state of Mr. Jaggers hung about him too , forbidding approach beyond certain limits . His personal recognition of each successive client was comprised in a nod , and in his settling his hat a little easier on his head with both hands , and then tightening the post - office , and putting his hands in his pockets . In one or two instances there was a difficulty respecting the raising of fees , and then Mr. Wemmick , backing as far as possible from the insufficient money produced , said , “
121473	121491	121493	121499	the man I shall shake hands with	2740	” Thus , we walked through Wemmick ’s greenhouse , until he turned to me and said , “
121501	121621	121622	121622	Colonel	2741	” I should have done so , without the preparation , as he had shaken hands with no one yet . Almost as soon as he had spoken , a portly upright man ( whom I can see now , as I write ) in a well - worn olive - coloured frock - coat , with a peculiar pallor overspreading the red in his complexion , and eyes that went wandering about when he tried to fix them , came up to a corner of the bars , and put his hand to his hat — which had a greasy and fatty surface like cold broth — with a half - serious and half - jocose military salute . “
121627	121631	121676	121677	sir,—but _	2744	” said Wemmick ; “
121638	121639	121636	121636	Colonel	2741	” “
121646	121647	121643	121644	Mr. Wemmick	269	” “
121667	121668	121665	121665	Colonel	338	” “
121684	121685	121678	121678	I	0	” “
121690	121696	121698	121698	you	2741	” said Wemmick , coolly , “
121704	121711	121698	121698	you	2741	” Then , turning to me , “
121729	121733	121698	121698	you	2741	” I said , “
121736	121772	121773	121773	I	0	” and the man ’s eyes looked at me , and then looked over my head , and then looked all round me , and then he drew his hand across his lips and laughed . “
121786	121792	121784	121784	sir	4442	” he said to Wemmick . “
121795	121800	121784	121784	sir	4442	” returned my friend , “
121807	121808	121809	121809	I	0	” “
121826	121839	121823	121824	Mr. Wemmick	269	” said the man , stretching out his hand between two bars . “
121842	121851	121823	121824	Mr. Wemmick	269	” said Wemmick , shaking hands with him . “
121858	121859	121856	121856	Colonel	2741	” “
121875	121887	121872	121873	Mr. Wemmick	269	” said the man , unwilling to let his hand go , “
121906	121907	121908	121908	I	0	” “
121917	121921	121908	121908	I	0	” said Wemmick . “
121934	121943	121926	121926	you	0	” The man looked up at the sky . “
121979	121980	121958	121958	you	4442	” “
121988	121989	121958	121958	you	4442	” “
121993	121997	121958	121958	you	4442	” said Wemmick , “
122015	122031	122032	122033	A Coiner	2757	” They shook hands again , and as we walked away Wemmick said to me , “
122081	122162	122165	122166	Mr. Wemmick	269	” With that , he looked back , and nodded at this dead plant , and then cast his eyes about him in walking out of the yard , as if he were considering what other pot would go best in its place . As we came out of the prison through the lodge , I found that the great importance of my guardian was appreciated by the turnkeys , no less than by those whom they held in charge . “
122168	122196	122165	122166	Mr. Wemmick	269	” said the turnkey , who kept us between the two studded and spiked lodge gates , and who carefully locked one before he unlocked the other , “
122229	122230	122222	122222	he	245	” “
122238	122242	122234	122234	you	269	” returned Wemmick . “
122250	122255	122234	122234	you	269	” said the turnkey . “
122269	122283	122266	122267	Mr. Pip	249	” remarked Wemmick , turning to me with his post - office elongated . “
122310	122311	122302	122302	’em	2762	” “
122328	122342	122344	122344	he	2764	” asked the turnkey , with a grin at Mr. Wemmick ’s humour . “
122351	122355	122344	122344	he	2764	” cried Wemmick , “
122383	122384	122376	122377	Mr. Pip	249	” “
122388	122396	122397	122397	he	2764	” said the turnkey , grinning again , “
122404	122405	122400	122401	Mr. Jaggers	245	” “
122408	122423	122397	122397	he	2764	” cried Wemmick , suddenly hitting out at the turnkey in a facetious way , “
122470	122501	122459	122459	him	2763	” The turnkey laughed , and gave us good day , and stood laughing at us over the spikes of the wicket when we descended the steps into the street . “
122508	122527	122503	122503	you	249	” said Wemmick , gravely in my ear , as he took my arm to be more confidential ; “
122616	123079	123080	123080	I	0	” I was very much impressed , and not for the first time , by my guardian ’s subtlety . To confess the truth , I very heartily wished , and not for the first time , that I had had some other guardian of minor abilities . Mr. Wemmick and I parted at the office in Little Britain , where suppliants for Mr. Jaggers ’s notice were lingering about as usual , and I returned to my watch in the street of the coach - office , with some three hours on hand . I consumed the whole time in thinking how strange it was that I should be encompassed by all this taint of prison and crime ; that , in my childhood out on our lonely marshes on a winter evening , I should have first encountered it ; that , it should have reappeared on two occasions , starting out like a stain that was faded but not gone ; that , it should in this new way pervade my fortune and advancement . While my mind was thus engaged , I thought of the beautiful young Estella , proud and refined , coming towards me , and I thought with absolute abhorrence of the contrast between the jail and her . I wished that Wemmick had not met me , or that I had not yielded to him and gone with him , so that , of all days in the year on this day , I might not have had Newgate in my breath and on my clothes . I beat the prison dust off my feet as I sauntered to and fro , and I shook it out of my dress , and I exhaled its air from my lungs . So contaminated did I feel , remembering who was coming , that the coach came quickly after all , and I was not yet free from the soiling consciousness of Mr. Wemmick ’s conservatory , when I saw her face at the coach window and her hand waving to me . What _ was _ the nameless shadow which again in that one instant had passed ? Chapter XXXIII . In her furred travelling - dress , Estella seemed more delicately beautiful than she had ever seemed yet , even in my eyes . Her manner was more winning than she had cared to let it be to me before , and I thought I saw Miss Havisham ’s influence in the change . We stood in the Inn Yard while she pointed out her luggage to me , and when it was all collected I remembered — having forgotten everything but herself in the meanwhile — that I knew nothing of her destination . “
123086	123091	123080	123080	I	0	” she told me . “
123190	123223	123189	123189	I.	0	” As she looked at me in giving me the purse , I hoped there was an inner meaning in her words . She said them slightingly , but not with displeasure . “
123242	123243	123236	123236	you	196	” “
123273	123454	123263	123263	you	2773	” She drew her arm through mine , as if it must be done , and I requested a waiter who had been staring at the coach like a man who had never seen such a thing in his life , to show us a private sitting - room . Upon that , he pulled out a napkin , as if it were a magic clue without which he could n’t find the way upstairs , and led us to the black hole of the establishment , fitted up with a diminishing mirror ( quite a superfluous article , considering the hole ’s proportions ) , an anchovy sauce - cruet , and somebody ’s pattens . On my objecting to this retreat , he took us into another room with a dinner - table for thirty , and in the grate a scorched leaf of a copy - book under a bushel of coal - dust . Having looked at this extinct conflagration and shaken his head , he took my order ; which , proving to be merely , “
123461	123582	123263	123263	you	2773	” sent him out of the room in a very low state of mind . I was , and I am , sensible that the air of this chamber , in its strong combination of stable with soup - stock , might have led one to infer that the coaching department was not doing well , and that the enterprising proprietor was boiling down the horses for the refreshment department . Yet the room was all in all to me , Estella being in it . I thought that with her I could have been happy there for life . ( I was not at all happy there at the time , observe , and I knew it well . ) “
123592	123597	123585	123585	you	2777	” I asked Estella . “
123604	123608	123626	123626	she	2778	” said she , “
123649	123650	123626	123626	she	2778	” “
123662	123663	123666	123666	I	0	” “
123670	123680	123681	123681	You	2777	” She answered so carelessly , that I said , “
123693	123694	123681	123681	You	2777	” “
123709	123716	123717	123717	you	2777	” said Estella , smiling delightfully , “
123747	123748	123744	123745	Mr. Pocket	282	” “
123758	123770	123749	123749	I	0	” It appeared to me that I was losing a chance . “
123774	123778	123749	123749	I	0	” repeated Estella . “
123790	123791	123749	123749	I	0	” “
123796	123803	123749	123749	I	0	” said Estella , quite composedly , “
123828	123829	123813	123814	Mr. Matthew	212	” “
123840	123841	123846	123846	his	6170	” “
123849	123853	123846	123846	his	6170	” interposed Estella , “
123879	123880	123863	123863	he	6170	” “
123892	123893	123884	123884	I	0	” “
123909	123929	123894	123894	You	2777	” said Estella , nodding at me with an expression of face that was at once grave and rallying , “
123985	123986	123987	123987	They	2792	” “
123996	124050	124051	124051	I	0	” Instead of answering , Estella burst out laughing . This was very singular to me , and I looked at her in considerable perplexity . When she left off — and she had not laughed languidly , but with real enjoyment — I said , in my diffident way with her , — “
124069	124070	124074	124074	you	2777	” “
124081	124085	124086	124086	You	2777	” said Estella . “
124111	124178	124086	124086	You	2777	” She laughed again , and even now when she had told me why , her laughter was very singular to me , for I could not doubt its being genuine , and yet it seemed too much for the occasion . I thought there must really be something more here than I knew ; she saw the thought in my mind , and answered it . “
124187	124191	124185	124185	you	2777	” said Estella , “
124316	124357	124313	124313	I	0	” It was no laughing matter with Estella now , nor was she summoning these remembrances from any shallow place . I would not have been the cause of that look of hers for all my expectations in a heap . “
124365	124369	124360	124360	I	0	” said Estella . “
124448	124474	124475	124475	You	2777	” As she gave it to me playfully,—for her darker mood had been but momentary — I held it and put it to my lips . “
124479	124483	124485	124485	you	2777	” said Estella , “
124510	124511	124492	124492	you	2777	” “
124517	124520	124521	124521	I	0	” said I. “
124537	124538	124521	124521	I	0	” “
124551	124552	124553	124553	You	0	” “
124571	124586	124568	124568	you	0	” I leaned down , and her calm face was like a statue ’s . “
124589	124602	124603	124603	you	2777	” said Estella , gliding away the instant I touched her cheek , “
124623	124969	124615	124615	you	2777	” Her reverting to this tone as if our association were forced upon us , and we were mere puppets , gave me pain ; but everything in our intercourse did give me pain . Whatever her tone with me happened to be , I could put no trust in it , and build no hope on it ; and yet I went on against trust and against hope . Why repeat it a thousand times ? So it always was . I rang for the tea , and the waiter , reappearing with his magic clue , brought in by degrees some fifty adjuncts to that refreshment , but of tea not a glimpse . A teaboard , cups and saucers , plates , knives and forks ( including carvers ) , spoons ( various ) , salt - cellars , a meek little muffin confined with the utmost precaution under a strong iron cover , Moses in the bulrushes typified by a soft bit of butter in a quantity of parsley , a pale loaf with a powdered head , two proof impressions of the bars of the kitchen fireplace on triangular bits of bread , and ultimately a fat family urn ; which the waiter staggered in with , expressing in his countenance burden and suffering . After a prolonged absence at this stage of the entertainment , he at length came back with a casket of precious appearance containing twigs . These I steeped in hot water , and so from the whole of these appliances extracted one cup of I do n’t know what for Estella . The bill paid , and the waiter remembered , and the ostler not forgotten , and the chambermaid taken into consideration,—in a word , the whole house bribed into a state of contempt and animosity , and Estella ’s purse much lightened,—we got into our post - coach and drove away . Turning into Cheapside and rattling up Newgate Street , we were soon under the walls of which I was so ashamed . “
124975	125012	124615	124615	you	2777	” Estella asked me . I made a foolish pretence of not at first recognising it , and then told her . As she looked at it , and drew in her head again , murmuring , “
125015	125028	125029	125030	Mr. Jaggers	245	” I would not have confessed to my visit for any consideration . “
125032	125046	125029	125030	Mr. Jaggers	245	” said I , by way of putting it neatly on somebody else , “
125066	125067	125068	125068	He	245	” “
125081	125090	125078	125078	I	0	” said Estella , in a low voice . “
125103	125104	125100	125100	I	0	” “
125153	125154	125148	125148	you	0	” “
125162	125166	125148	125148	you	0	” said I , “
125173	125174	125176	125176	you	0	” “
125179	125180	125176	125176	you	0	” “
125191	125192	125181	125181	I	0	” “
125196	125201	125181	125181	I	0	” said Estella , shrinking “
125209	125210	125176	125176	you	0	” “
125217	125414	125176	125176	you	0	” I should have been chary of discussing my guardian too freely even with her ; but I should have gone on with the subject so far as to describe the dinner in Gerrard Street , if we had not then come into a sudden glare of gas . It seemed , while it lasted , to be all alight and alive with that inexplicable feeling I had had before ; and when we were out of it , I was as much dazed for a few moments as if I had been in lightning . So we fell into other talk , and it was principally about the way by which we were travelling , and about what parts of London lay on this side of it , and what on that . The great city was almost new to her , she told me , for she had never left Miss Havisham ’s neighbourhood until she had gone to France , and she had merely passed through London then in going and returning . I asked her if my guardian had any charge of her while she remained here ? To that she emphatically said “
125418	125556	125176	125176	you	0	” and no more . It was impossible for me to avoid seeing that she cared to attract me ; that she made herself winning , and would have won me even if the task had needed pains . Yet this made me none the happier , for even if she had not taken that tone of our being disposed of by others , I should have felt that she held my heart in her hand because she wilfully chose to do it , and not because it would have wrung any tenderness in her to crush it and throw it away . When we passed through Hammersmith , I showed her where Mr. Matthew Pocket lived , and said it was no great way from Richmond , and that I hoped I should see her sometimes . “
125590	125607	125615	125615	mother	2810	” I inquired was it a large household she was going to be a member of ? “
125636	125637	125638	125638	I	0	” “
125650	125651	125640	125641	Miss Havisham	227	” “
125666	125680	125664	125664	Pip	249	” said Estella , with a sigh , as if she were tired ; “
125708	126801	126802	126802	Gentlemen	4867	” It was the first time she had ever called me by my name . Of course she did so purposely , and knew that I should treasure it up . We came to Richmond all too soon , and our destination there was a house by the green,—a staid old house , where hoops and powder and patches , embroidered coats , rolled stockings , ruffles and swords , had had their court days many a time . Some ancient trees before the house were still cut into fashions as formal and unnatural as the hoops and wigs and stiff skirts ; but their own allotted places in the great procession of the dead were not far off , and they would soon drop into them and go the silent way of the rest . A bell with an old voice — which I dare say in its time had often said to the house , Here is the green farthingale , Here is the diamond - hilted sword , Here are the shoes with red heels and the blue solitaire — sounded gravely in the moonlight , and two cherry - coloured maids came fluttering out to receive Estella . The doorway soon absorbed her boxes , and she gave me her hand and a smile , and said good - night , and was absorbed likewise . And still I stood looking at the house , thinking how happy I should be if I lived there with her , and knowing that I never was happy with her , but always miserable . I got into the carriage to be taken back to Hammersmith , and I got in with a bad heart - ache , and I got out with a worse heart - ache . At our own door , I found little Jane Pocket coming home from a little party escorted by her little lover ; and I envied her little lover , in spite of his being subject to Flopson . Mr. Pocket was out lecturing ; for , he was a most delightful lecturer on domestic economy , and his treatises on the management of children and servants were considered the very best text - books on those themes . But Mrs. Pocket was at home , and was in a little difficulty , on account of the baby ’s having been accommodated with a needle - case to keep him quiet during the unaccountable absence ( with a relative in the Foot Guards ) of Millers . And more needles were missing than it could be regarded as quite wholesome for a patient of such tender years either to apply externally or to take as a tonic . Mr. Pocket being justly celebrated for giving most excellent practical advice , and for having a clear and sound perception of things and a highly judicious mind , I had some notion in my heart - ache of begging him to accept my confidence . But happening to look up at Mrs. Pocket as she sat reading her book of dignities after prescribing Bed as a sovereign remedy for baby , I thought — Well — No , I would n’t . Chapter XXXIV . As I had grown accustomed to my expectations , I had insensibly begun to notice their effect upon myself and those around me . Their influence on my own character I disguised from my recognition as much as possible , but I knew very well that it was not all good . I lived in a state of chronic uneasiness respecting my behaviour to Joe . My conscience was not by any means comfortable about Biddy . When I woke up in the night,—like Camilla,—I used to think , with a weariness on my spirits , that I should have been happier and better if I had never seen Miss Havisham ’s face , and had risen to manhood content to be partners with Joe in the honest old forge . Many a time of an evening , when I sat alone looking at the fire , I thought , after all there was no fire like the forge fire and the kitchen fire at home . Yet Estella was so inseparable from all my restlessness and disquiet of mind , that I really fell into confusion as to the limits of my own part in its production . That is to say , supposing I had had no expectations , and yet had had Estella to think of , I could not make out to my satisfaction that I should have done much better . Now , concerning the influence of my position on others , I was in no such difficulty , and so I perceived — though dimly enough perhaps — that it was not beneficial to anybody , and , above all , that it was not beneficial to Herbert . My lavish habits led his easy nature into expenses that he could not afford , corrupted the simplicity of his life , and disturbed his peace with anxieties and regrets . I was not at all remorseful for having unwittingly set those other branches of the Pocket family to the poor arts they practised ; because such littlenesses were their natural bent , and would have been evoked by anybody else , if I had left them slumbering . But Herbert ’s was a very different case , and it often caused me a twinge to think that I had done him evil service in crowding his sparely furnished chambers with incongruous upholstery work , and placing the Canary - breasted Avenger at his disposal . So now , as an infallible way of making little ease great ease , I began to contract a quantity of debt . I could hardly begin but Herbert must begin too , so he soon followed . At Startop ’s suggestion , we put ourselves down for election into a club called The Finches of the Grove : the object of which institution I have never divined , if it were not that the members should dine expensively once a fortnight , to quarrel among themselves as much as possible after dinner , and to cause six waiters to get drunk on the stairs . I know that these gratifying social ends were so invariably accomplished , that Herbert and I understood nothing else to be referred to in the first standing toast of the society : which ran “
126821	127544	126802	126802	Gentlemen	4867	” The Finches spent their money foolishly ( the Hotel we dined at was in Covent Garden ) , and the first Finch I saw when I had the honour of joining the Grove was Bentley Drummle , at that time floundering about town in a cab of his own , and doing a great deal of damage to the posts at the street corners . Occasionally , he shot himself out of his equipage headforemost over the apron ; and I saw him on one occasion deliver himself at the door of the Grove in this unintentional way — like coals . But here I anticipate a little , for I was not a Finch , and could not be , according to the sacred laws of the society , until I came of age . In my confidence in my own resources , I would willingly have taken Herbert ’s expenses on myself ; but Herbert was proud , and I could make no such proposal to him . So he got into difficulties in every direction , and continued to look about him . When we gradually fell into keeping late hours and late company , I noticed that he looked about him with a desponding eye at breakfast - time ; that he began to look about him more hopefully about midday ; that he drooped when he came into dinner ; that he seemed to descry Capital in the distance , rather clearly , after dinner ; that he all but realised Capital towards midnight ; and that at about two o’clock in the morning , he became so deeply despondent again as to talk of buying a rifle and going to America , with a general purpose of compelling buffaloes to make his fortune . I was usually at Hammersmith about half the week , and when I was at Hammersmith I haunted Richmond , whereof separately by and by . Herbert would often come to Hammersmith when I was there , and I think at those seasons his father would occasionally have some passing perception that the opening he was looking for , had not appeared yet . But in the general tumbling up of the family , his tumbling out in life somewhere , was a thing to transact itself somehow . In the meantime Mr. Pocket grew greyer , and tried oftener to lift himself out of his perplexities by the hair . While Mrs. Pocket tripped up the family with her footstool , read her book of dignities , lost her pocket - handkerchief , told us about her grandpapa , and taught the young idea how to shoot , by shooting it into bed whenever it attracted her notice . As I am now generalising a period of my life with the object of clearing my way before me , I can scarcely do so better than by at once completing the description of our usual manners and customs at Barnard ’s Inn . We spent as much money as we could , and got as little for it as people could make up their minds to give us . We were always more or less miserable , and most of our acquaintance were in the same condition . There was a gay fiction among us that we were constantly enjoying ourselves , and a skeleton truth that we never did . To the best of my belief , our case was in the last aspect a rather common one . Every morning , with an air ever new , Herbert went into the City to look about him . I often paid him a visit in the dark back - room in which he consorted with an ink - jar , a hat - peg , a coal - box , a string - box , an almanac , a desk and stool , and a ruler ; and I do not remember that I ever saw him do anything else but look about him . If we all did what we undertake to do , as faithfully as Herbert did , we might live in a Republic of the Virtues . He had nothing else to do , poor fellow , except at a certain hour of every afternoon to “
127547	127629	126802	126802	Gentlemen	4867	Lloyd’s”—in observance of a ceremony of seeing his principal , I think . He never did anything else in connection with Lloyd ’s that I could find out , except come back again . When he felt his case unusually serious , and that he positively must find an opening , he would go on ’ Change at a busy time , and walk in and out , in a kind of gloomy country dance figure , among the assembled magnates . “
127632	127649	126802	126802	Gentlemen	4867	” says Herbert to me , coming home to dinner on one of those special occasions , “
127678	127786	126802	126802	Gentlemen	4867	” If we had been less attached to one another , I think we must have hated one another regularly every morning . I detested the chambers beyond expression at that period of repentance , and could not endure the sight of the Avenger ’s livery ; which had a more expensive and a less remunerative appearance then than at any other time in the four - and - twenty hours . As we got more and more into debt , breakfast became a hollower and hollower form , and , being on one occasion at breakfast - time threatened ( by letter ) with legal proceedings , “
127791	127800	126802	126802	Gentlemen	4867	” as my local paper might put it , “
127804	127876	127877	127877	My	0	” I went so far as to seize the Avenger by his blue collar and shake him off his feet,—so that he was actually in the air , like a booted Cupid,—for presuming to suppose that we wanted a roll . At certain times — meaning at uncertain times , for they depended on our humour — I would say to Herbert , as if it were a remarkable discovery , — “
127887	127888	127891	127891	Handel	284	” “
127893	127904	127891	127891	Handel	284	” Herbert would say to me , in all sincerity , “
127924	127925	127928	127928	Herbert	282	” “
127930	127935	127928	127928	Herbert	282	” I would respond , “
127943	128098	127928	127928	Herbert	282	” We always derived profound satisfaction from making an appointment for this purpose . I always thought this was business , this was the way to confront the thing , this was the way to take the foe by the throat . And I know Herbert thought so too . We ordered something rather special for dinner , with a bottle of something similarly out of the common way , in order that our minds might be fortified for the occasion , and we might come well up to the mark . Dinner over , we produced a bundle of pens , a copious supply of ink , and a goodly show of writing and blotting paper . For there was something very comfortable in having plenty of stationery . I would then take a sheet of paper , and write across the top of it , in a neat hand , the heading , “
128104	128134	127928	127928	Herbert	282	” ; with Barnard ’s Inn and the date very carefully added . Herbert would also take a sheet of paper , and write across it with similar formalities , “
128141	128271	128272	128272	They	2819	” Each of us would then refer to a confused heap of papers at his side , which had been thrown into drawers , worn into holes in pockets , half burnt in lighting candles , stuck for weeks into the looking - glass , and otherwise damaged . The sound of our pens going refreshed us exceedingly , insomuch that I sometimes found it difficult to distinguish between this edifying business proceeding and actually paying the money . In point of meritorious character , the two things seemed about equal . When we had written a little while , I would ask Herbert how he got on ? Herbert probably would have been scratching his head in a most rueful manner at the sight of his accumulating figures . “
128279	128284	128277	128277	Handel	284	” Herbert would say ; “
128294	128295	128299	128299	Herbert	282	” “
128301	128314	128299	128299	Herbert	282	” I would retort , plying my own pen with great assiduity . “
128333	128334	128342	128342	they	2819	” “
128352	128407	128342	128342	they	2819	” However , my determined manner would have its effect , and Herbert would fall to work again . After a time he would give up once more , on the plea that he had not got Cobbs ’s bill , or Lobbs ’s , or Nobbs ’s , as the case might be . “
128425	128426	128410	128410	Herbert	282	” “
128435	128444	128410	128410	Herbert	282	” my friend would reply , with admiration . “
128453	128605	128410	128410	Herbert	282	” I thought so too . I established with myself , on these occasions , the reputation of a first - rate man of business,—prompt , decisive , energetic , clear , cool - headed . When I had got all my responsibilities down upon my list , I compared each with the bill , and ticked it off . My self - approval when I ticked an entry was quite a luxurious sensation . When I had no more ticks to make , I folded all my bills up uniformly , docketed each on the back , and tied the whole into a symmetrical bundle . Then I did the same for Herbert ( who modestly said he had not my administrative genius ) , and felt that I had brought his affairs into a focus for him . My business habits had one other bright feature , which I called “
128610	128637	128410	128410	Herbert	282	” For example ; supposing Herbert ’s debts to be one hundred and sixty - four pounds four - and - twopence , I would say , “
128650	128880	128410	128410	Herbert	282	” Or , supposing my own to be four times as much , I would leave a margin , and put them down at seven hundred . I had the highest opinion of the wisdom of this same Margin , but I am bound to acknowledge that on looking back , I deem it to have been an expensive device . For , we always ran into new debt immediately , to the full extent of the margin , and sometimes , in the sense of freedom and solvency it imparted , got pretty far on into another margin . But there was a calm , a rest , a virtuous hush , consequent on these examinations of our affairs that gave me , for the time , an admirable opinion of myself . Soothed by my exertions , my method , and Herbert ’s compliments , I would sit with his symmetrical bundle and my own on the table before me among the stationery , and feel like a Bank of some sort , rather than a private individual . We shut our outer door on these solemn occasions , in order that we might not be interrupted . I had fallen into my serene state one evening , when we heard a letter dropped through the slit in the said door , and fall on the ground . “
128888	128900	128886	128886	Handel	284	” said Herbert , going out and coming back with it , “
128910	129756	128902	128902	I	0	” This was in allusion to its heavy black seal and border . The letter was signed Trabb & amp ; Co. , and its contents were simply , that I was an honoured sir , and that they begged to inform me that Mrs. J. Gargery had departed this life on Monday last at twenty minutes past six in the evening , and that my attendance was requested at the interment on Monday next at three o’clock in the afternoon . Chapter XXXV . It was the first time that a grave had opened in my road of life , and the gap it made in the smooth ground was wonderful . The figure of my sister in her chair by the kitchen fire , haunted me night and day . That the place could possibly be , without her , was something my mind seemed unable to compass ; and whereas she had seldom or never been in my thoughts of late , I had now the strangest ideas that she was coming towards me in the street , or that she would presently knock at the door . In my rooms too , with which she had never been at all associated , there was at once the blankness of death and a perpetual suggestion of the sound of her voice or the turn of her face or figure , as if she were still alive and had been often there . Whatever my fortunes might have been , I could scarcely have recalled my sister with much tenderness . But I suppose there is a shock of regret which may exist without much tenderness . Under its influence ( and perhaps to make up for the want of the softer feeling ) I was seized with a violent indignation against the assailant from whom she had suffered so much ; and I felt that on sufficient proof I could have revengefully pursued Orlick , or any one else , to the last extremity . Having written to Joe , to offer him consolation , and to assure him that I would come to the funeral , I passed the intermediate days in the curious state of mind I have glanced at . I went down early in the morning , and alighted at the Blue Boar in good time to walk over to the forge . It was fine summer weather again , and , as I walked along , the times when I was a little helpless creature , and my sister did not spare me , vividly returned . But they returned with a gentle tone upon them that softened even the edge of Tickler . For now , the very breath of the beans and clover whispered to my heart that the day must come when it would be well for my memory that others walking in the sunshine should be softened as they thought of me . At last I came within sight of the house , and saw that Trabb and Co. had put in a funereal execution and taken possession . Two dismally absurd persons , each ostentatiously exhibiting a crutch done up in a black bandage,—as if that instrument could possibly communicate any comfort to anybody,—were posted at the front door ; and in one of them I recognised a postboy discharged from the Boar for turning a young couple into a sawpit on their bridal morning , in consequence of intoxication rendering it necessary for him to ride his horse clasped round the neck with both arms . All the children of the village , and most of the women , were admiring these sable warders and the closed windows of the house and forge ; and as I came up , one of the two warders ( the postboy ) knocked at the door,—implying that I was far too much exhausted by grief to have strength remaining to knock for myself . Another sable warder ( a carpenter , who had once eaten two geese for a wager ) opened the door , and showed me into the best parlour . Here , Mr. Trabb had taken unto himself the best table , and had got all the leaves up , and was holding a kind of black Bazaar , with the aid of a quantity of black pins . At the moment of my arrival , he had just finished putting somebody ’s hat into black long - clothes , like an African baby ; so he held out his hand for mine . But I , misled by the action , and confused by the occasion , shook hands with him with every testimony of warm affection . Poor dear Joe , entangled in a little black cloak tied in a large bow under his chin , was seated apart at the upper end of the room ; where , as chief mourner , he had evidently been stationed by Trabb . When I bent down and said to him , “
129764	129768	129769	129769	Pip	249	” he said , “
129786	130018	129778	129778	she	2823	” and clasped my hand and said no more . Biddy , looking very neat and modest in her black dress , went quietly here and there , and was very helpful . When I had spoken to Biddy , as I thought it not a time for talking I went and sat down near Joe , and there began to wonder in what part of the house it — she — my sister — was . The air of the parlour being faint with the smell of sweet - cake , I looked about for the table of refreshments ; it was scarcely visible until one had got accustomed to the gloom , but there was a cut - up plum cake upon it , and there were cut - up oranges , and sandwiches , and biscuits , and two decanters that I knew very well as ornaments , but had never seen used in all my life ; one full of port , and one of sherry . Standing at this table , I became conscious of the servile Pumblechook in a black cloak and several yards of hatband , who was alternately stuffing himself , and making obsequious movements to catch my attention . The moment he succeeded , he came over to me ( breathing sherry and crumbs ) , and said in a subdued voice , “
130025	130055	130020	130020	I	0	” and did . I then descried Mr. and Mrs. Hubble ; the last - named in a decent speechless paroxysm in a corner . We were all going to “
130058	130077	130020	130020	I	0	” and were all in course of being tied up separately ( by Trabb ) into ridiculous bundles . “
130084	130097	130082	130082	Pip	249	” Joe whispered me , as we were being what Mr. Trabb called “
130099	130120	130122	130122	I	0	” in the parlour , two and two,—and it was dreadfully like a preparation for some grim kind of dance ; “
130181	130182	130162	130163	the neighbours	504	” “
130190	130206	130162	130163	the neighbours	504	” cried Mr. Trabb at this point , in a depressed business - like voice . “
130216	130405	130409	130409	they	2831	” So we all put our pocket - handkerchiefs to our faces , as if our noses were bleeding , and filed out two and two ; Joe and I ; Biddy and Pumblechook ; Mr. and Mrs. Hubble . The remains of my poor sister had been brought round by the kitchen door , and , it being a point of Undertaking ceremony that the six bearers must be stifled and blinded under a horrible black velvet housing with a white border , the whole looked like a blind monster with twelve human legs , shuffling and blundering along , under the guidance of two keepers,—the postboy and his comrade . The neighbourhood , however , highly approved of these arrangements , and we were much admired as we went through the village ; the more youthful and vigorous part of the community making dashes now and then to cut us off , and lying in wait to intercept us at points of vantage . At such times the more exuberant among them called out in an excited manner on our emergence round some corner of expectancy , “
130412	130413	130409	130409	they	2831	” “
130420	131060	131061	131061	Biddy	186	” and we were all but cheered . In this progress I was much annoyed by the abject Pumblechook , who , being behind me , persisted all the way as a delicate attention in arranging my streaming hatband , and smoothing my cloak . My thoughts were further distracted by the excessive pride of Mr. and Mrs. Hubble , who were surpassingly conceited and vainglorious in being members of so distinguished a procession . And now the range of marshes lay clear before us , with the sails of the ships on the river growing out of it ; and we went into the churchyard , close to the graves of my unknown parents , Philip Pirrip , late of this parish , and Also Georgiana , Wife of the Above . And there , my sister was laid quietly in the earth , while the larks sang high above it , and the light wind strewed it with beautiful shadows of clouds and trees . Of the conduct of the worldly minded Pumblechook while this was doing , I desire to say no more than it was all addressed to me ; and that even when those noble passages were read which remind humanity how it brought nothing into the world and can take nothing out , and how it fleeth like a shadow and never continueth long in one stay , I heard him cough a reservation of the case of a young gentleman who came unexpectedly into large property . When we got back , he had the hardihood to tell me that he wished my sister could have known I had done her so much honour , and to hint that she would have considered it reasonably purchased at the price of her death . After that , he drank all the rest of the sherry , and Mr. Hubble drank the port , and the two talked ( which I have since observed to be customary in such cases ) as if they were of quite another race from the deceased , and were notoriously immortal . Finally , he went away with Mr. and Mrs. Hubble,—to make an evening of it , I felt sure , and to tell the Jolly Bargemen that he was the founder of my fortunes and my earliest benefactor . When they were all gone , and when Trabb and his men — but not his Boy ; I looked for him — had crammed their mummery into bags , and were gone too , the house felt wholesomer . Soon afterwards , Biddy , Joe , and I , had a cold dinner together ; but we dined in the best parlour , not in the old kitchen , and Joe was so exceedingly particular what he did with his knife and fork and the saltcellar and what not , that there was great restraint upon us . But after dinner , when I made him take his pipe , and when I had loitered with him about the forge , and when we sat down together on the great block of stone outside it , we got on better . I noticed that after the funeral Joe changed his clothes so far , as to make a compromise between his Sunday dress and working dress ; in which the dear fellow looked natural , and like the Man he was . He was very much pleased by my asking if I might sleep in my own little room , and I was pleased too ; for I felt that I had done rather a great thing in making the request . When the shadows of evening were closing in , I took an opportunity of getting into the garden with Biddy for a little talk . “
131063	131067	131061	131061	Biddy	186	” said I , “
131081	131082	131070	131070	you	186	” “
131089	131093	131084	131084	you	0	” said Biddy . “
131104	131105	131099	131099	I	0	” “
131131	131132	131134	131134	you	0	” “
131139	131192	131134	131134	you	0	” She was so quiet , and had such an orderly , good , and pretty way with her , that I did not like the thought of making her cry again . After looking a little at her downcast eyes as she walked beside me , I gave up that point . “
131209	131210	131206	131206	Biddy	186	” “
131222	131237	131219	131220	Mr. Pip	249	” said Biddy , in a tone of regret but still of quiet conviction . “
131277	131278	131267	131268	Mr. Gargery	203	” “
131294	131295	131289	131289	you	186	” “
131303	131318	131319	131319	I	0	” repeated Biddy , striking in , with a momentary flush upon her face . “
131380	131397	131377	131378	Mr. Pip	249	” pursued Biddy , with a smile , as she raised her eyes to my face , “
131428	131429	131408	131408	I	0	” “
131443	131444	131437	131437	Biddy	186	” “
131456	131502	131449	131449	my	0	” murmured Biddy . It was not so much a reproach as an irresistible thinking aloud . Well ! I thought I would give up that point too . So , I walked a little further with Biddy , looking silently at her downcast eyes . “
131517	131518	131515	131515	Biddy	186	” “
131707	131734	131703	131703	she	4457	” Biddy cried ; the darkening garden , and the lane , and the stars that were coming out , were blurred in my own sight . “
131742	131743	131740	131740	Biddy	186	” “
131746	131747	131740	131740	Biddy	186	” “
131757	131758	131755	131755	Orlick	228	” “
131776	131777	131783	131783	him	203	” “
131796	131797	131786	131786	you	186	” “
131809	131810	131800	131800	him	203	” “
131821	131822	131819	131819	Biddy	186	” “
131842	131860	131861	131861	you	186	” said Biddy , laying her hand upon my arm , as I was for running out , “
131881	131998	131877	131877	he	203	” It revived my utmost indignation to find that she was still pursued by this fellow , and I felt inveterate against him . I told her so , and told her that I would spend any money or take any pains to drive him out of that country . By degrees she led me into more temperate talk , and she told me how Joe loved me , and how Joe never complained of anything,—she did n’t say , of me ; she had no need ; I knew what she meant,—but ever did his duty in his way of life , with a strong hand , a quiet tongue , and a gentle heart . “
132012	132016	132010	132010	him	2849	” said I ; “
132049	132057	132058	132058	Biddy	186	” Biddy said never a single word . “
132066	132067	132062	132062	you	186	” “
132073	132074	132070	132071	Mr. Pip	249	” “
132097	132098	132094	132094	you	186	” “
132104	132110	132101	132101	I	0	” asked Biddy , timidly . “
132113	132125	132111	132111	Biddy	186	” said I , in a virtuously self - asserting manner , “
132137	132138	132132	132132	you	186	” “
132142	132146	132101	132101	I	0	” said Biddy . “
132153	132157	132158	132158	You	186	” I retorted . “
132166	132167	132158	132158	You	186	” “
132171	132175	132158	132158	You	186	” said Biddy . “
132182	132212	132213	132213	Biddy	186	” Well ! I rather thought I would give up that point too . After another silent turn in the garden , I fell back on the main position . “
132215	132219	132213	132213	Biddy	186	” said I , “
132254	132255	132247	132247	Biddy	186	” “
132272	132297	132264	132264	you	186	” asked Biddy , stopping in the narrow garden walk , and looking at me under the stars with a clear and honest eye . “
132302	132319	132264	132264	you	186	” said I , as if I found myself compelled to give up Biddy in despair . “
132349	132519	132341	132341	Biddy	186	” For which cogent reason I kept Biddy at a distance during supper , and when I went up to my own old little room , took as stately a leave of her as I could , in my murmuring soul , deem reconcilable with the churchyard and the event of the day . As often as I was restless in the night , and that was every quarter of an hour , I reflected what an unkindness , what an injury , what an injustice , Biddy had done me . Early in the morning I was to go . Early in the morning I was out , and looking in , unseen , at one of the wooden windows of the forge . There I stood , for minutes , looking at Joe , already at work with a glow of health and strength upon his face that made it show as if the bright sun of the life in store for him were shining on it . “
132550	132554	132534	132534	God	180	” [ Illustration ] “
132561	132565	132534	132534	God	180	” said Joe , “
132573	132596	132597	132597	Biddy	186	” Biddy was waiting for me at the kitchen door , with a mug of new milk and a crust of bread . “
132599	132612	132597	132597	Biddy	186	” said I , when I gave her my hand at parting , “
132623	132624	132597	132597	Biddy	186	” “
132632	132638	132597	132597	Biddy	186	” she pleaded quite pathetically ; “
132651	133019	132646	132646	I	0	” Once more , the mists were rising as I walked away . If they disclosed to me , as I suspect they did , that I should _ not _ come back , and that Biddy was quite right , all I can say is,—they were quite right too . Chapter XXXVI . Herbert and I went on from bad to worse , in the way of increasing our debts , looking into our affairs , leaving Margins , and the like exemplary transactions ; and Time went on , whether or no , as he has a way of doing ; and I came of age,—in fulfilment of Herbert ’s prediction , that I should do so before I knew where I was . Herbert himself had come of age eight months before me . As he had nothing else than his majority to come into , the event did not make a profound sensation in Barnard ’s Inn . But we had looked forward to my one - and - twentieth birthday , with a crowd of speculations and anticipations , for we had both considered that my guardian could hardly help saying something definite on that occasion . I had taken care to have it well understood in Little Britain when my birthday was . On the day before it , I received an official note from Wemmick , informing me that Mr. Jaggers would be glad if I would call upon him at five in the afternoon of the auspicious day . This convinced us that something great was to happen , and threw me into an unusual flutter when I repaired to my guardian ’s office , a model of punctuality . In the outer office Wemmick offered me his congratulations , and incidentally rubbed the side of his nose with a folded piece of tissue - paper that I liked the look of . But he said nothing respecting it , and motioned me with a nod into my guardian ’s room . It was November , and my guardian was standing before his fire leaning his back against the chimney - piece , with his hands under his coattails . “
133024	133028	133022	133022	Pip	249	” said he , “
133044	133058	133041	133042	Mr. Pip	249	” We shook hands,—he was always a remarkably short shaker,—and I thanked him . “
133066	133143	133063	133064	Mr. Pip	249	” said my guardian . As I sat down , and he preserved his attitude and bent his brows at his boots , I felt at a disadvantage , which reminded me of that old time when I had been put upon a tombstone . The two ghastly casts on the shelf were not far from him , and their expression was as if they were making a stupid apoplectic attempt to attend to the conversation . “
133149	133164	133145	133147	my young friend	1841	” my guardian began , as if I were a witness in the box , “
133177	133178	133165	133165	I	0	” “
133185	133186	133183	133183	sir	4442	” “
133192	133215	133189	133189	you	1841	” said Mr. Jaggers , bending forward to look at the ground , and then throwing his head back to look at the ceiling,—“what
133227	133228	133219	133219	you	1841	” “
133236	133237	133219	133219	you	1841	” “
133240	133251	133219	133219	you	1841	” repeated Mr. Jaggers , still looking at the ceiling , “
133258	133334	133335	133335	I	0	” And then looked all round the room , and paused with his pocket - handkerchief in his hand , half - way to his nose . I had looked into my affairs so often , that I had thoroughly destroyed any slight notion I might ever have had of their bearings . Reluctantly , I confessed myself quite unable to answer the question . This reply seemed agreeable to Mr. Jaggers , who said , “
133339	133350	133335	133335	I	0	” and blew his nose with an air of satisfaction . “
133365	133370	133353	133353	I	0	” said Mr. Jaggers . “
133380	133381	133372	133372	you	1841	” “
133406	133407	133403	133403	your	1841	” “
133411	133416	133403	133403	your	1841	” said Mr. Jaggers . “
133430	133431	133403	133403	your	1841	” “
133437	133438	133403	133403	your	1841	” “
133449	133450	133403	133403	your	1841	” “
133457	133462	133403	133403	your	1841	” said Mr. Jaggers , “
133467	133486	133465	133465	another	2859	” I looked about me , but there appeared to be now no possible escape from the inquiry , “
133497	133507	133508	133508	I	0	” On that , Mr. Jaggers said , triumphantly , “
133516	133539	133508	133508	I	0	” and called to Wemmick to give him that piece of paper . Wemmick appeared , handed it in , and disappeared . “
133545	133550	133554	133554	you	249	” said Mr. Jaggers , “
133586	133587	133588	133588	I	0	” “
133598	133599	133591	133591	I	0	” “
133611	133616	133619	133619	sir	4442	” said Mr. Jaggers . “
133621	133622	133619	133619	sir	4442	” “
133662	133681	133689	133689	you	249	” cried Mr. Jaggers , waving his forefinger to stop me as I made a show of protesting : “
133739	133740	133734	133734	me	0	” “
133748	133752	133734	133734	me	0	” said I , “
133758	133759	133734	133734	me	0	” “
133767	133772	133734	133734	me	0	” repeated Mr. Jaggers , “
133795	133796	133790	133790	You	249	” “
133803	133804	133790	133790	You	249	” “
133812	133817	133790	133790	You	249	” said Mr. Jaggers . “
133820	133821	133822	133822	You	249	” “
133992	134019	134020	134020	I	0	” I was beginning to express my gratitude to my benefactor for the great liberality with which I was treated , when Mr. Jaggers stopped me . “
134027	134033	134025	134025	Pip	249	” said he , coolly , “
134042	134084	134025	134025	Pip	249	” and then gathered up his coat - tails , as he had gathered up the subject , and stood frowning at his boots as if he suspected them of designs against him . After a pause , I hinted , — “
134117	134118	134107	134107	I	0	” “
134123	134159	134107	134107	I	0	” said he . I might have known that he would never help me out ; but it took me aback to have to shape the question afresh , as if it were quite new . “
134164	134171	134107	134107	I	0	” I said , after hesitating , “
134191	134197	134185	134186	Mr. Jaggers	245	” there I delicately stopped . “
134202	134207	134185	134186	Mr. Jaggers	245	” asked Mr. Jaggers . “
134219	134220	134185	134186	Mr. Jaggers	245	” “
134227	134241	134185	134186	Mr. Jaggers	245	” said I , after casting about for a precise form of words , “
134248	134249	134185	134186	Mr. Jaggers	245	” “
134254	134273	134185	134186	Mr. Jaggers	245	” replied Mr. Jaggers , fixing me for the first time with his dark deep - set eyes , “
134299	134300	134297	134297	Pip	249	” “
134319	134320	134301	134301	You	245	” “
134324	134329	134332	134332	my	0	” said Mr. Jaggers , “
134335	134398	134301	134301	You	245	” As we looked full at one another , I felt my breath come quicker in my strong desire to get something out of him . And as I felt that it came quicker , and as I felt that he saw that it came quicker , I felt that I had less chance than ever of getting anything out of him . “
134412	134475	134400	134400	you	245	” Mr. Jaggers shook his head,—not in negativing the question , but in altogether negativing the notion that he could anyhow be got to answer it,—and the two horrible casts of the twitched faces looked , when my eyes strayed up to them , as if they had come to a crisis in their suspended attention , and were going to sneeze . “
134478	134497	134498	134498	I	0	” said Mr. Jaggers , warming the backs of his legs with the backs of his warmed hands , “
134557	134586	134551	134551	I	0	” He bent down so low to frown at his boots , that he was able to rub the calves of his legs in the pause he made . “
134592	134600	134588	134589	that person	4926	” said Mr. Jaggers , straightening himself , “
134654	134765	134648	134648	I	0	” We looked at one another until I withdrew my eyes , and looked thoughtfully at the floor . From this last speech I derived the notion that Miss Havisham , for some reason or no reason , had not taken him into her confidence as to her designing me for Estella ; that he resented this , and felt a jealousy about it ; or that he really did object to that scheme , and would have nothing to do with it . When I raised my eyes again , I found that he had been shrewdly looking at me all the time , and was doing so still . “
134777	134781	134770	134770	you	0	” I remarked , “
134792	135041	135042	135043	Mr. Wemmick	269	” He nodded assent , and pulled out his thief - dreaded watch , and asked me where I was going to dine ? I replied at my own chambers , with Herbert . As a necessary sequence , I asked him if he would favour us with his company , and he promptly accepted the invitation . But he insisted on walking home with me , in order that I might make no extra preparation for him , and first he had a letter or two to write , and ( of course ) had his hands to wash . So I said I would go into the outer office and talk to Wemmick . The fact was , that when the five hundred pounds had come into my pocket , a thought had come into my head which had been often there before ; and it appeared to me that Wemmick was a good person to advise with concerning such thought . He had already locked up his safe , and made preparations for going home . He had left his desk , brought out his two greasy office candlesticks and stood them in line with the snuffers on a slab near the door , ready to be extinguished ; he had raked his fire low , put his hat and great - coat ready , and was beating himself all over the chest with his safe - key , as an athletic exercise after business . “
135045	135049	135042	135043	Mr. Wemmick	269	” said I , “
135066	135092	135057	135057	I	0	” Wemmick tightened his post - office and shook his head , as if his opinion were dead against any fatal weakness of that sort . “
135096	135100	135057	135057	I	0	” I pursued , “
135137	135138	135198	135199	Mr. Pip	249	” “
135143	135155	135198	135199	Mr. Pip	249	” said Wemmick , in a tone drier than any sawdust . “
135163	135181	135198	135199	Mr. Pip	249	” I replied , for an uneasy remembrance shot across me of that symmetrical bundle of papers at home—“with
135196	135197	135198	135199	Mr. Pip	249	” “
135201	135205	135198	135199	Mr. Pip	249	” said Wemmick , “
135266	135292	135323	135324	Mr. Pip	249	” He had checked off each bridge in its turn , with the handle of his safe - key on the palm of his hand . “
135307	135308	135323	135324	Mr. Pip	249	” “
135315	135318	135309	135309	I	0	” said I. “
135326	135330	135323	135324	Mr. Pip	249	” returned Wemmick , “
135386	135406	135429	135429	your	0	” I could have posted a newspaper in his mouth , he made it so wide after saying this . “
135412	135415	135429	135429	your	0	” said I. “
135421	135425	135429	135429	your	0	” said Wemmick . “
135432	135441	135429	135429	your	0	” I inquired , with some little indignation , “
135448	135449	135443	135444	a man	462	” “
135458	135462	135464	135464	he	462	” said Wemmick . “
135496	135497	135507	135507	your	0	” “
135501	135505	135507	135507	your	0	” said I , “
135514	135515	135507	135507	your	0	” “
135518	135522	135524	135524	my	0	” he returned , “
135531	135532	135524	135524	my	0	” “
135535	135553	135524	135524	my	0	” said I , pressing him , for I thought I saw him near a loophole here ; “
135563	135564	135565	135566	Mr. Pip	249	” “
135568	135575	135565	135566	Mr. Pip	249	” he replied , with gravity , “
135629	135630	135643	135643	I	0	” “
135634	135641	135643	135643	I	0	” said I , much relieved , “
135657	135658	135659	135660	Mr. Pip	249	” “
135662	135666	135659	135660	Mr. Pip	249	” he returned , “
135680	135991	135992	135992	My	0	” We had held this conversation in a low voice , well knowing my guardian ’s ears to be the sharpest of the sharp . As he now appeared in his doorway , towelling his hands , Wemmick got on his great - coat and stood by to snuff out the candles . We all three went into the street together , and from the door - step Wemmick turned his way , and Mr. Jaggers and I turned ours . I could not help wishing more than once that evening , that Mr. Jaggers had had an Aged in Gerrard Street , or a Stinger , or a Something , or a Somebody , to unbend his brows a little . It was an uncomfortable consideration on a twenty - first birthday , that coming of age at all seemed hardly worth while in such a guarded and suspicious world as he made of it . He was a thousand times better informed and cleverer than Wemmick , and yet I would a thousand times rather have had Wemmick to dinner . And Mr. Jaggers made not me alone intensely melancholy , because , after he was gone , Herbert said of himself , with his eyes fixed on the fire , that he thought he must have committed a felony and forgotten the details of it , he felt so dejected and guilty . Chapter XXXVII . Deeming Sunday the best day for taking Mr. Wemmick ’s Walworth sentiments , I devoted the next ensuing Sunday afternoon to a pilgrimage to the Castle . On arriving before the battlements , I found the Union Jack flying and the drawbridge up ; but undeterred by this show of defiance and resistance , I rang at the gate , and was admitted in a most pacific manner by the Aged . “
135997	136008	136013	136013	his	2248	” said the old man , after securing the drawbridge , “
136060	136085	136086	136086	You	4442	” I nodded at the old gentleman as Wemmick himself might have nodded , and we went in and sat down by the fireside . “
136095	136115	136120	136120	I	0	” said the old man , in his chirping way , while he warmed his hands at the blaze , “
136123	136127	136120	136120	I	0	” I nodded . “
136146	136151	136144	136144	sir	4442	” I nodded hard . “
136165	136170	136155	136155	they	2910	” I nodded harder . “
136180	136186	136155	136155	they	2910	” said the old man , “
136204	136246	136253	136253	you	0	” Curious to know how the old gentleman stood informed concerning the reputation of Mr. Jaggers , I roared that name at him . He threw me into the greatest confusion by laughing heartily and replying in a very sprightly manner , “
136257	136313	136253	136253	you	0	” And to this hour I have not the faintest notion what he meant , or what joke he thought I had made . As I could not sit there nodding at him perpetually , without making some other attempt to interest him , I shouted at inquiry whether his own calling in life had been “
136319	136355	136253	136253	you	0	” By dint of straining that term out of myself several times and tapping the old gentleman on the chest to associate it with him , I at last succeeded in making my meaning understood . “
136358	136364	136253	136253	you	0	” said the old gentleman ; “
136376	136396	136253	136253	you	0	” he appeared to mean up the chimney , but I believe he intended to refer me to Liverpool ; “
136421	136430	136413	136413	I	0	” I expressed in pantomime the greatest astonishment . “
136484	136494	136478	136478	you	0	” pursued the old man , again laughing heartily , “
136509	136567	136568	136568	JOHN	310	” I was modestly wondering whether my utmost ingenuity would have enabled me to say anything that would have amused him half as much as this imaginary pleasantry , when I was startled by a sudden click in the wall on one side of the chimney , and the ghostly tumbling open of a little wooden flap with “
136569	136586	136587	136587	My	0	” upon it . The old man , following my eyes , cried with great triumph , “
136593	136868	136587	136587	My	0	” and we both went out to the drawbridge . It was worth any money to see Wemmick waving a salute to me from the other side of the moat , when we might have shaken hands across it with the greatest ease . The Aged was so delighted to work the drawbridge , that I made no offer to assist him , but stood quiet until Wemmick had come across , and had presented me to Miss Skiffins ; a lady by whom he was accompanied . Miss Skiffins was of a wooden appearance , and was , like her escort , in the post - office branch of the service . She might have been some two or three years younger than Wemmick , and I judged her to stand possessed of portable property . The cut of her dress from the waist upward , both before and behind , made her figure very like a boy ’s kite ; and I might have pronounced her gown a little too decidedly orange , and her gloves a little too intensely green . But she seemed to be a good sort of fellow , and showed a high regard for the Aged . I was not long in discovering that she was a frequent visitor at the Castle ; for , on our going in , and my complimenting Wemmick on his ingenious contrivance for announcing himself to the Aged , he begged me to give my attention for a moment to the other side of the chimney , and disappeared . Presently another click came , and another little door tumbled open with “
136871	136926	136587	136587	My	0	” on it ; then Miss Skiffins shut up and John tumbled open ; then Miss Skiffins and John both tumbled open together , and finally shut up together . On Wemmick ’s return from working these mechanical appliances , I expressed the great admiration with which I regarded them , and he said , “
136984	136985	136978	136979	Miss Skiffins	355	” “
136992	136997	136999	136999	his	269	” added Miss Skiffins , “
137008	137421	137004	137004	his	269	” While Miss Skiffins was taking off her bonnet ( she retained her green gloves during the evening as an outward and visible sign that there was company ) , Wemmick invited me to take a walk with him round the property , and see how the island looked in wintertime . Thinking that he did this to give me an opportunity of taking his Walworth sentiments , I seized the opportunity as soon as we were out of the Castle . Having thought of the matter with care , I approached my subject as if I had never hinted at it before . I informed Wemmick that I was anxious in behalf of Herbert Pocket , and I told him how we had first met , and how we had fought . I glanced at Herbert ’s home , and at his character , and at his having no means but such as he was dependent on his father for ; those , uncertain and unpunctual . I alluded to the advantages I had derived in my first rawness and ignorance from his society , and I confessed that I feared I had but ill repaid them , and that he might have done better without me and my expectations . Keeping Miss Havisham in the background at a great distance , I still hinted at the possibility of my having competed with him in his prospects , and at the certainty of his possessing a generous soul , and being far above any mean distrusts , retaliations , or designs . For all these reasons ( I told Wemmick ) , and because he was my young companion and friend , and I had a great affection for him , I wished my own good fortune to reflect some rays upon him , and therefore I sought advice from Wemmick ’s experience and knowledge of men and affairs , how I could best try with my resources to help Herbert to some present income,—say of a hundred a year , to keep him in good hope and heart,—and gradually to buy him on to some small partnership . I begged Wemmick , in conclusion , to understand that my help must always be rendered without Herbert ’s knowledge or suspicion , and that there was no one else in the world with whom I could advise . I wound up by laying my hand upon his shoulder , and saying , “
137453	137471	137443	137443	your	2923	” Wemmick was silent for a little while , and then said with a kind of start , “
137493	137494	137491	137491	you	2923	” “
137505	137508	137496	137496	you	2923	” said I. “
137511	137519	137496	137496	you	2923	” replied Wemmick , shaking his head , “
137526	137527	137496	137496	you	2923	” “
137536	137539	137496	137496	you	2923	” said I. “
137544	137548	137549	137549	You	2923	” he returned . “
137608	137609	137610	137610	I	0	” “
137617	137618	137610	137610	I	0	” “
137623	137627	137610	137610	I	0	” said he , “
137664	138081	138084	138085	Aged Parent	2246	” After a little further conversation to the same effect , we returned into the Castle where we found Miss Skiffins preparing tea . The responsible duty of making the toast was delegated to the Aged , and that excellent old gentleman was so intent upon it that he seemed to me in some danger of melting his eyes . It was no nominal meal that we were going to make , but a vigorous reality . The Aged prepared such a hay - stack of buttered toast , that I could scarcely see him over it as it simmered on an iron stand hooked on to the top - bar ; while Miss Skiffins brewed such a jorum of tea , that the pig in the back premises became strongly excited , and repeatedly expressed his desire to participate in the entertainment . The flag had been struck , and the gun had been fired , at the right moment of time , and I felt as snugly cut off from the rest of Walworth as if the moat were thirty feet wide by as many deep . Nothing disturbed the tranquillity of the Castle , but the occasional tumbling open of John and Miss Skiffins : which little doors were a prey to some spasmodic infirmity that made me sympathetically uncomfortable until I got used to it . I inferred from the methodical nature of Miss Skiffins ’s arrangements that she made tea there every Sunday night ; and I rather suspected that a classic brooch she wore , representing the profile of an undesirable female with a very straight nose and a very new moon , was a piece of portable property that had been given her by Wemmick . We ate the whole of the toast , and drank tea in proportion , and it was delightful to see how warm and greasy we all got after it . The Aged especially , might have passed for some clean old chief of a savage tribe , just oiled . After a short pause of repose , Miss Skiffins — in the absence of the little servant who , it seemed , retired to the bosom of her family on Sunday afternoons — washed up the tea - things , in a trifling lady - like amateur manner that compromised none of us . Then , she put on her gloves again , and we drew round the fire , and Wemmick said , “
138092	138127	138084	138085	Aged Parent	2246	” Wemmick explained to me while the Aged got his spectacles out , that this was according to custom , and that it gave the old gentleman infinite satisfaction to read the news aloud . “
138135	138139	138128	138128	I	0	” said Wemmick , “
138155	138156	138150	138150	you	2246	” “
138165	138176	138160	138160	John	310	” returned the old man , seeing himself spoken to . “
138193	138197	138199	138199	he	2246	” said Wemmick , “
138216	138217	138213	138214	Aged One	261	” “
138226	139858	139859	139859	Pip	249	” returned the cheerful old man , so busy and so pleased , that it really was quite charming . The Aged ’s reading reminded me of the classes at Mr. Wopsle ’s great - aunt ’s , with the pleasanter peculiarity that it seemed to come through a keyhole . As he wanted the candles close to him , and as he was always on the verge of putting either his head or the newspaper into them , he required as much watching as a powder - mill . But Wemmick was equally untiring and gentle in his vigilance , and the Aged read on , quite unconscious of his many rescues . Whenever he looked at us , we all expressed the greatest interest and amazement , and nodded until he resumed again . As Wemmick and Miss Skiffins sat side by side , and as I sat in a shadowy corner , I observed a slow and gradual elongation of Mr. Wemmick ’s mouth , powerfully suggestive of his slowly and gradually stealing his arm round Miss Skiffins ’s waist . In course of time I saw his hand appear on the other side of Miss Skiffins ; but at that moment Miss Skiffins neatly stopped him with the green glove , unwound his arm again as if it were an article of dress , and with the greatest deliberation laid it on the table before her . Miss Skiffins ’s composure while she did this was one of the most remarkable sights I have ever seen , and if I could have thought the act consistent with abstraction of mind , I should have deemed that Miss Skiffins performed it mechanically . By and by , I noticed Wemmick ’s arm beginning to disappear again , and gradually fading out of view . Shortly afterwards , his mouth began to widen again . After an interval of suspense on my part that was quite enthralling and almost painful , I saw his hand appear on the other side of Miss Skiffins . Instantly , Miss Skiffins stopped it with the neatness of a placid boxer , took off that girdle or cestus as before , and laid it on the table . Taking the table to represent the path of virtue , I am justified in stating that during the whole time of the Aged ’s reading , Wemmick ’s arm was straying from the path of virtue and being recalled to it by Miss Skiffins . At last , the Aged read himself into a light slumber . This was the time for Wemmick to produce a little kettle , a tray of glasses , and a black bottle with a porcelain - topped cork , representing some clerical dignitary of a rubicund and social aspect . With the aid of these appliances we all had something warm to drink , including the Aged , who was soon awake again . Miss Skiffins mixed , and I observed that she and Wemmick drank out of one glass . Of course I knew better than to offer to see Miss Skiffins home , and under the circumstances I thought I had best go first ; which I did , taking a cordial leave of the Aged , and having passed a pleasant evening . Before a week was out , I received a note from Wemmick , dated Walworth , stating that he hoped he had made some advance in that matter appertaining to our private and personal capacities , and that he would be glad if I could come and see him again upon it . So , I went out to Walworth again , and yet again , and yet again , and I saw him by appointment in the City several times , but never held any communication with him on the subject in or near Little Britain . The upshot was , that we found a worthy young merchant or shipping - broker , not long established in business , who wanted intelligent help , and who wanted capital , and who in due course of time and receipt would want a partner . Between him and me , secret articles were signed of which Herbert was the subject , and I paid him half of my five hundred pounds down , and engaged for sundry other payments : some , to fall due at certain dates out of my income : some , contingent on my coming into my property . Miss Skiffins ’s brother conducted the negotiation . Wemmick pervaded it throughout , but never appeared in it . The whole business was so cleverly managed , that Herbert had not the least suspicion of my hand being in it . I never shall forget the radiant face with which he came home one afternoon , and told me , as a mighty piece of news , of his having fallen in with one Clarriker ( the young merchant ’s name ) , and of Clarriker ’s having shown an extraordinary inclination towards him , and of his belief that the opening had come at last . Day by day as his hopes grew stronger and his face brighter , he must have thought me a more and more affectionate friend , for I had the greatest difficulty in restraining my tears of triumph when I saw him so happy . At length , the thing being done , and he having that day entered Clarriker ’s House , and he having talked to me for a whole evening in a flush of pleasure and success , I did really cry in good earnest when I went to bed , to think that my expectations had done some good to somebody . A great event in my life , the turning point of my life , now opens on my view . But , before I proceed to narrate it , and before I pass on to all the changes it involved , I must give one chapter to Estella . It is not much to give to the theme that so long filled my heart . Chapter XXXVIII . If that staid old house near the Green at Richmond should ever come to be haunted when I am dead , it will be haunted , surely , by my ghost . O the many , many nights and days through which the unquiet spirit within me haunted that house when Estella lived there ! Let my body be where it would , my spirit was always wandering , wandering , wandering , about that house . The lady with whom Estella was placed , Mrs. Brandley by name , was a widow , with one daughter several years older than Estella . The mother looked young , and the daughter looked old ; the mother ’s complexion was pink , and the daughter ’s was yellow ; the mother set up for frivolity , and the daughter for theology . They were in what is called a good position , and visited , and were visited by , numbers of people . Little , if any , community of feeling subsisted between them and Estella , but the understanding was established that they were necessary to her , and that she was necessary to them . Mrs. Brandley had been a friend of Miss Havisham ’s before the time of her seclusion . In Mrs. Brandley ’s house and out of Mrs. Brandley ’s house , I suffered every kind and degree of torture that Estella could cause me . The nature of my relations with her , which placed me on terms of familiarity without placing me on terms of favour , conduced to my distraction . She made use of me to tease other admirers , and she turned the very familiarity between herself and me to the account of putting a constant slight on my devotion to her . If I had been her secretary , steward , half - brother , poor relation,—if I had been a younger brother of her appointed husband,—I could not have seemed to myself further from my hopes when I was nearest to her . The privilege of calling her by her name and hearing her call me by mine became , under the circumstances an aggravation of my trials ; and while I think it likely that it almost maddened her other lovers , I know too certainly that it almost maddened me . She had admirers without end . No doubt my jealousy made an admirer of every one who went near her ; but there were more than enough of them without that . I saw her often at Richmond , I heard of her often in town , and I used often to take her and the Brandleys on the water ; there were picnics , fête days , plays , operas , concerts , parties , all sorts of pleasures , through which I pursued her,—and they were all miseries to me . I never had one hour ’s happiness in her society , and yet my mind all round the four - and - twenty hours was harping on the happiness of having her with me unto death . Throughout this part of our intercourse,—and it lasted , as will presently be seen , for what I then thought a long time,—she habitually reverted to that tone which expressed that our association was forced upon us . There were other times when she would come to a sudden check in this tone and in all her many tones , and would seem to pity me . “
139863	139889	139861	139861	Pip	249	” she said one evening , coming to such a check , when we sat apart at a darkening window of the house in Richmond ; “
139896	139897	139891	139891	you	249	” “
139901	139902	139904	139904	me	0	” “
139906	139907	139904	139904	me	0	” “
139922	139923	139917	139917	you	249	” “
139941	140033	139934	139934	I	0	” I should have replied that Love was commonly reputed blind , but for the reason that I always was restrained — and this was not the least of my miseries — by a feeling that it was ungenerous to press myself upon her , when she knew that she could not choose but obey Miss Havisham . My dread always was , that this knowledge on her part laid me under a heavy disadvantage with her pride , and made me the subject of a rebellious struggle in her bosom . “
140038	140042	139934	139934	I	0	” said I , “
140065	140066	140053	140053	you	249	” “
140071	140104	140053	140053	you	249	” said Estella , with a cold careless smile that always chilled me . After looking at the twilight without , for a little while , she went on to say : — “
140174	140175	140170	140170	you	249	” “
140183	140184	140185	140185	You	249	” “
140219	140220	140211	140211	You	249	” “
140225	140407	140211	140211	You	249	” said I. This was all the preparation I received for that visit , or for others like it ; Miss Havisham never wrote to me , nor had I ever so much as seen her handwriting . We went down on the next day but one , and we found her in the room where I had first beheld her , and it is needless to add that there was no change in Satis House . She was even more dreadfully fond of Estella than she had been when I last saw them together ; I repeat the word advisedly , for there was something positively dreadful in the energy of her looks and embraces . She hung upon Estella ’s beauty , hung upon her words , hung upon her gestures , and sat mumbling her own trembling fingers while she looked at her , as though she were devouring the beautiful creature she had reared . From Estella she looked at me , with a searching glance that seemed to pry into my heart and probe its wounds . “
140422	141083	140418	140418	she	2937	” she asked me again , with her witch - like eagerness , even in Estella ’s hearing . But , when we sat by her flickering fire at night , she was most weird ; for then , keeping Estella ’s hand drawn through her arm and clutched in her own hand , she extorted from her , by dint of referring back to what Estella had told her in her regular letters , the names and conditions of the men whom she had fascinated ; and as Miss Havisham dwelt upon this roll , with the intensity of a mind mortally hurt and diseased , she sat with her other hand on her crutch stick , and her chin on that , and her wan bright eyes glaring at me , a very spectre . I saw in this , wretched though it made me , and bitter the sense of dependence and even of degradation that it awakened,—I saw in this that Estella was set to wreak Miss Havisham ’s revenge on men , and that she was not to be given to me until she had gratified it for a term . I saw in this , a reason for her being beforehand assigned to me . Sending her out to attract and torment and do mischief , Miss Havisham sent her with the malicious assurance that she was beyond the reach of all admirers , and that all who staked upon that cast were secured to lose . I saw in this that I , too , was tormented by a perversion of ingenuity , even while the prize was reserved for me . I saw in this the reason for my being staved off so long and the reason for my late guardian ’s declining to commit himself to the formal knowledge of such a scheme . In a word , I saw in this Miss Havisham as I had her then and there before my eyes , and always had had her before my eyes ; and I saw in this , the distinct shadow of the darkened and unhealthy house in which her life was hidden from the sun . The candles that lighted that room of hers were placed in sconces on the wall . They were high from the ground , and they burnt with the steady dulness of artificial light in air that is seldom renewed . As I looked round at them , and at the pale gloom they made , and at the stopped clock , and at the withered articles of bridal dress upon the table and the ground , and at her own awful figure with its ghostly reflection thrown large by the fire upon the ceiling and the wall , I saw in everything the construction that my mind had come to , repeated and thrown back to me . My thoughts passed into the great room across the landing where the table was spread , and I saw it written , as it were , in the falls of the cobwebs from the centre - piece , in the crawlings of the spiders on the cloth , in the tracks of the mice as they betook their little quickened hearts behind the panels , and in the gropings and pausings of the beetles on the floor . It happened on the occasion of this visit that some sharp words arose between Estella and Miss Havisham . It was the first time I had ever seen them opposed . We were seated by the fire , as just now described , and Miss Havisham still had Estella ’s arm drawn through her own , and still clutched Estella ’s hand in hers , when Estella gradually began to detach herself . She had shown a proud impatience more than once before , and had rather endured that fierce affection than accepted or returned it . “
141086	141097	141099	141099	you	2939	” said Miss Havisham , flashing her eyes upon her , “
141104	141105	141099	141099	you	2939	” “
141113	141139	141099	141099	you	2939	” replied Estella , disengaging her arm , and moving to the great chimney - piece , where she stood looking down at the fire . “
141147	141160	141161	141161	you	2939	” cried Miss Havisham , passionately striking her stick upon the floor ; “
141167	141210	141161	141161	you	2939	” Estella looked at her with perfect composure , and again looked down at the fire . Her graceful figure and her beautiful face expressed a self - possessed indifference to the wild heat of the other , that was almost cruel . “
141216	141221	141161	141161	you	2939	” exclaimed Miss Havisham . “
141228	141229	141161	141161	you	2939	” “
141232	141256	141258	141258	you	2939	” said Estella , preserving her attitude of indifference as she leaned against the great chimney - piece and only moving her eyes ; “
141267	141268	141270	141270	you	2939	” “
141273	141279	141280	141280	You	2939	” was the fierce retort . “
141284	141288	141280	141280	You	2939	” said Estella . “
141323	141324	141329	141329	her	2940	” “
141335	141342	141333	141333	her	2940	” cried Miss Havisham , bitterly ; “
141387	141391	141378	141378	I	0	” [ Illustration ] “
141402	141406	141394	141394	I	0	” said Estella , “
141455	141456	141452	141452	you	2939	” “
141459	141464	141465	141465	You	2939	” replied the other . “
141469	141470	141465	141465	You	2939	” “
141475	141480	141481	141481	Mother	2810	” said Miss Havisham . “
141485	141514	141481	141481	Mother	2810	” retorted Estella , never departing from the easy grace of her attitude , never raising her voice as the other did , never yielding either to anger or tenderness,—“mother
141581	141582	141584	141584	I	0	” “
141590	141600	141584	141584	I	0	” cried Miss Havisham , turning wildly to me . “
141641	141642	141636	141636	her	2942	” “
141650	141654	141655	141655	I	0	” returned Estella , “
141741	141742	141733	141733	your	0	” “
141746	141751	141733	141733	your	0	” moaned Miss Havisham . “
141756	141757	141777	141777	you	0	” “
141763	141765	141777	141777	you	0	” retorted Estella,—“not
141804	141813	141797	141797	you	0	” she touched her bosom with her hand , “
141825	141826	141797	141797	you	0	” “
141833	141848	141797	141797	you	0	” moaned Miss Havisham , pushing away her grey hair with both her hands . “
141856	141860	141797	141797	you	0	” returned Estella . “
141870	141871	141797	141797	you	0	” “
141878	141888	141797	141797	you	0	” moaned Miss Havisham , with her former action . “
141896	141900	141797	141797	you	0	” returned Estella . “
141910	141911	141797	141797	you	0	” “
141923	141936	141937	141937	Estella	196	” Miss Havisham quite shrieked , as she stretched out her arms . “
141953	141988	141989	141989	I	0	” Estella looked at her for a moment with a kind of calm wonder , but was not otherwise disturbed ; when the moment was past , she looked down at the fire again . “
141994	142004	141989	141989	I	0	” said Estella , raising her eyes after a silence “
142055	142056	142049	142049	I	0	” “
142066	142071	142049	142049	I	0	” exclaimed Miss Havisham . “
142083	142084	142085	142085	I	0	” “
142090	142106	142085	142085	I	0	” said Estella , in a musing way , after another moment of calm wonder , “
142189	142218	142181	142181	you	196	” Miss Havisham , with her head in her hands , sat making a low moaning , and swaying herself on her chair , but gave no answer . “
142221	142223	142181	142181	you	196	” said Estella,—“which
142322	142348	142314	142314	you	196	” Miss Havisham sat listening ( or it seemed so , for I could not see her face ) , but still made no answer . “
142351	142355	142314	142314	you	196	” said Estella , “
142385	143225	143226	143226	Estella	196	” Miss Havisham had settled down , I hardly knew how , upon the floor , among the faded bridal relics with which it was strewn . I took advantage of the moment — I had sought one from the first — to leave the room , after beseeching Estella ’s attention to her , with a movement of my hand . When I left , Estella was yet standing by the great chimney - piece , just as she had stood throughout . Miss Havisham ’s grey hair was all adrift upon the ground , among the other bridal wrecks , and was a miserable sight to see . It was with a depressed heart that I walked in the starlight for an hour and more , about the courtyard , and about the brewery , and about the ruined garden . When I at last took courage to return to the room , I found Estella sitting at Miss Havisham ’s knee , taking up some stitches in one of those old articles of dress that were dropping to pieces , and of which I have often been reminded since by the faded tatters of old banners that I have seen hanging up in cathedrals . Afterwards , Estella and I played at cards , as of yore,—only we were skilful now , and played French games,—and so the evening wore away , and I went to bed . I lay in that separate building across the courtyard . It was the first time I had ever lain down to rest in Satis House , and sleep refused to come near me . A thousand Miss Havishams haunted me . She was on this side of my pillow , on that , at the head of the bed , at the foot , behind the half - opened door of the dressing - room , in the dressing - room , in the room overhead , in the room beneath,—everywhere . At last , when the night was slow to creep on towards two o’clock , I felt that I absolutely could no longer bear the place as a place to lie down in , and that I must get up . I therefore got up and put on my clothes , and went out across the yard into the long stone passage , designing to gain the outer courtyard and walk there for the relief of my mind . But I was no sooner in the passage than I extinguished my candle ; for I saw Miss Havisham going along it in a ghostly manner , making a low cry . I followed her at a distance , and saw her go up the staircase . She carried a bare candle in her hand , which she had probably taken from one of the sconces in her own room , and was a most unearthly object by its light . Standing at the bottom of the staircase , I felt the mildewed air of the feast - chamber , without seeing her open the door , and I heard her walking there , and so across into her own room , and so across again into that , never ceasing the low cry . After a time , I tried in the dark both to get out , and to go back , but I could do neither until some streaks of day strayed in and showed me where to lay my hands . During the whole interval , whenever I went to the bottom of the staircase , I heard her footstep , saw her light pass above , and heard her ceaseless low cry . Before we left next day , there was no revival of the difference between her and Estella , nor was it ever revived on any similar occasion ; and there were four similar occasions , to the best of my remembrance . Nor , did Miss Havisham ’s manner towards Estella in anywise change , except that I believed it to have something like fear infused among its former characteristics . It is impossible to turn this leaf of my life , without putting Bentley Drummle ’s name upon it ; or I would , very gladly . On a certain occasion when the Finches were assembled in force , and when good feeling was being promoted in the usual manner by nobody ’s agreeing with anybody else , the presiding Finch called the Grove to order , forasmuch as Mr. Drummle had not yet toasted a lady ; which , according to the solemn constitution of the society , it was the brute ’s turn to do that day . I thought I saw him leer in an ugly way at me while the decanters were going round , but as there was no love lost between us , that might easily be . What was my indignant surprise when he called upon the company to pledge him to “
143228	143229	143226	143226	Estella	196	” “
143233	143236	143230	143230	Estella	196	” said I. “
143241	143245	143246	143246	Estella	196	” retorted Drummle . “
143250	143253	143246	143246	Estella	196	” said I. “
143262	143271	143254	143254	You	2951	” Which he was , as a Finch . “
143277	143288	143275	143275	gentlemen	4867	” said Drummle , putting me out of the question , “
143294	143312	143313	143313	I	0	” Much he knew about peerless beauties , a mean , miserable idiot ! I whispered Herbert . “
143318	143333	143315	143316	that lady	1106	” said Herbert , across the table , when the toast had been honoured . “
143339	143343	143337	143337	you	2951	” said Drummle . “
143349	143358	143347	143347	I	0	” I added , with a scarlet face . “
143364	143368	143362	143362	you	2951	” said Drummle . “
143375	143632	143373	143373	Lord	2955	” This was the only retort — except glass or crockery — that the heavy creature was capable of making ; but , I became as highly incensed by it as if it had been barbed with wit , and I immediately rose in my place and said that I could not but regard it as being like the honourable Finch ’s impudence to come down to that Grove,—we always talked about coming down to that Grove , as a neat Parliamentary turn of expression,—down to that Grove , proposing a lady of whom he knew nothing . Mr. Drummle , upon this , starting up , demanded what I meant by that ? Whereupon I made him the extreme reply that I believed he knew where I was to be found . Whether it was possible in a Christian country to get on without blood , after this , was a question on which the Finches were divided . The debate upon it grew so lively , indeed , that at least six more honourable members told six more , during the discussion , that they believed _ they _ knew where _ they _ were to be found . However , it was decided at last ( the Grove being a Court of Honour ) that if Mr. Drummle would bring never so slight a certificate from the lady , importing that he had the honour of her acquaintance , Mr. Pip must express his regret , as a gentleman and a Finch , for “
143641	143700	143373	143373	Lord	2955	” Next day was appointed for the production ( lest our honour should take cold from delay ) , and next day Drummle appeared with a polite little avowal in Estella ’s hand , that she had had the honour of dancing with him several times . This left me no course but to regret that I had been “
143707	144181	143373	143373	Lord	2955	” and on the whole to repudiate , as untenable , the idea that I was to be found anywhere . Drummle and I then sat snorting at one another for an hour , while the Grove engaged in indiscriminate contradiction , and finally the promotion of good feeling was declared to have gone ahead at an amazing rate . I tell this lightly , but it was no light thing to me . For , I can not adequately express what pain it gave me to think that Estella should show any favour to a contemptible , clumsy , sulky booby , so very far below the average . To the present moment , I believe it to have been referable to some pure fire of generosity and disinterestedness in my love for her , that I could not endure the thought of her stooping to that hound . No doubt I should have been miserable whomsoever she had favoured ; but a worthier object would have caused me a different kind and degree of distress . It was easy for me to find out , and I did soon find out , that Drummle had begun to follow her closely , and that she allowed him to do it . A little while , and he was always in pursuit of her , and he and I crossed one another every day . He held on , in a dull persistent way , and Estella held him on ; now with encouragement , now with discouragement , now almost flattering him , now openly despising him , now knowing him very well , now scarcely remembering who he was . The Spider , as Mr. Jaggers had called him , was used to lying in wait , however , and had the patience of his tribe . Added to that , he had a blockhead confidence in his money and in his family greatness , which sometimes did him good service,—almost taking the place of concentration and determined purpose . So , the Spider , doggedly watching Estella , outwatched many brighter insects , and would often uncoil himself and drop at the right nick of time . At a certain Assembly Ball at Richmond ( there used to be Assembly Balls at most places then ) , where Estella had outshone all other beauties , this blundering Drummle so hung about her , and with so much toleration on her part , that I resolved to speak to her concerning him . I took the next opportunity ; which was when she was waiting for Mrs. Blandley to take her home , and was sitting apart among some flowers , ready to go . I was with her , for I almost always accompanied them to and from such places . “

144300	144311	144295	144295	I	0	” returned Estella , with her eyes on me instead . “

144345	144348	144339	144339	I	0	” said I. “

144370	144380	144350	144350	he	2958	” replied Estella , with a glance towards him , “

144397	144401	144437	144437	Estella	196	” I returned ; “
144410	144411	144405	144406	the Estella	196	” “
144414	144424	144405	144406	the Estella	196	” said she , laughing , after a moment , “

144466	144467	144462	144462	he	2958	” “
144470	144474	144462	144462	he	2958	” said she . “

144501	144505	144485	144495	A deficient , ill - tempered , lowering , stupid fellow	2962	” said she . “

144536	144580	144530	144530	you	196	” said she again ; and each time she said it , she opened her lovely eyes the wider . To overcome the difficulty of getting past that monosyllable , I took it from her , and said , repeating it with emphasis , “
144593	144653	144654	144654	Pip	249	” Now , if I could have believed that she favoured Drummle with any idea of making me — me — wretched , I should have been in better heart about it ; but in that habitual way of hers , she put me so entirely out of the question , that I could believe nothing of the kind . “
144656	144667	144654	144654	Pip	249	” said Estella , casting her glance over the room , “
144699	144700	144721	144721	she	2966	” “
144705	144709	144721	144721	she	2966	” said I , “

144747	144751	144742	144742	I	0	” said Estella . “

144777	144785	144788	144788	his	2968	” said Estella , opening her hands . “

144808	144815	144805	144805	you	0	” said I , something hurriedly , “
144839	144840	144820	144820	you	0	” “
144847	144865	144842	144842	you	0	” said Estella , turning suddenly with a fixed and serious , if not angry , look , “
144872	144873	144875	144875	you	0	” “
144883	144884	144875	144875	you	0	” “
144906	145952	144897	144898	Mrs. Brandley	358	” And now that I have given the one chapter to the theme that so filled my heart , and so often made it ache and ache again , I pass on unhindered , to the event that had impended over me longer yet ; the event that had begun to be prepared for , before I knew that the world held Estella , and in the days when her baby intelligence was receiving its first distortions from Miss Havisham ’s wasting hands . In the Eastern story , the heavy slab that was to fall on the bed of state in the flush of conquest was slowly wrought out of the quarry , the tunnel for the rope to hold it in its place was slowly carried through the leagues of rock , the slab was slowly raised and fitted in the roof , the rope was rove to it and slowly taken through the miles of hollow to the great iron ring . All being made ready with much labour , and the hour come , the sultan was aroused in the dead of the night , and the sharpened axe that was to sever the rope from the great iron ring was put into his hand , and he struck with it , and the rope parted and rushed away , and the ceiling fell . So , in my case ; all the work , near and afar , that tended to the end , had been accomplished ; and in an instant the blow was struck , and the roof of my stronghold dropped upon me . Chapter XXXIX . I was three - and - twenty years of age . Not another word had I heard to enlighten me on the subject of my expectations , and my twenty - third birthday was a week gone . We had left Barnard ’s Inn more than a year , and lived in the Temple . Our chambers were in Garden - court , down by the river . Mr. Pocket and I had for some time parted company as to our original relations , though we continued on the best terms . Notwithstanding my inability to settle to anything,—which I hope arose out of the restless and incomplete tenure on which I held my means,—I had a taste for reading , and read regularly so many hours a day . That matter of Herbert ’s was still progressing , and everything with me was as I have brought it down to the close of the last preceding chapter . Business had taken Herbert on a journey to Marseilles . I was alone , and had a dull sense of being alone . Dispirited and anxious , long hoping that to - morrow or next week would clear my way , and long disappointed , I sadly missed the cheerful face and ready response of my friend . It was wretched weather ; stormy and wet , stormy and wet ; and mud , mud , mud , deep in all the streets . Day after day , a vast heavy veil had been driving over London from the East , and it drove still , as if in the East there were an eternity of cloud and wind . So furious had been the gusts , that high buildings in town had had the lead stripped off their roofs ; and in the country , trees had been torn up , and sails of windmills carried away ; and gloomy accounts had come in from the coast , of shipwreck and death . Violent blasts of rain had accompanied these rages of wind , and the day just closed as I sat down to read had been the worst of all . Alterations have been made in that part of the Temple since that time , and it has not now so lonely a character as it had then , nor is it so exposed to the river . We lived at the top of the last house , and the wind rushing up the river shook the house that night , like discharges of cannon , or breakings of a sea . When the rain came with it and dashed against the windows , I thought , raising my eyes to them as they rocked , that I might have fancied myself in a storm - beaten lighthouse . Occasionally , the smoke came rolling down the chimney as though it could not bear to go out into such a night ; and when I set the doors open and looked down the staircase , the staircase lamps were blown out ; and when I shaded my face with my hands and looked through the black windows ( opening them ever so little was out of the question in the teeth of such wind and rain ) , I saw that the lamps in the court were blown out , and that the lamps on the bridges and the shore were shuddering , and that the coal - fires in barges on the river were being carried away before the wind like red - hot splashes in the rain . I read with my watch upon the table , purposing to close my book at eleven o’clock . As I shut it , Saint Paul ’s , and all the many church - clocks in the City — some leading , some accompanying , some following — struck that hour . The sound was curiously flawed by the wind ; and I was listening , and thinking how the wind assailed and tore it , when I heard a footstep on the stair . What nervous folly made me start , and awfully connect it with the footstep of my dead sister , matters not . It was past in a moment , and I listened again , and heard the footstep stumble in coming on . Remembering then , that the staircase - lights were blown out , I took up my reading - lamp and went out to the stair - head . Whoever was below had stopped on seeing my lamp , for all was quiet . “
145964	145972	144897	144898	Mrs. Brandley	358	” I called out , looking down . “
145975	145984	144897	144898	Mrs. Brandley	358	” said a voice from the darkness beneath . “
145991	145992	145988	145988	you	2970	” “
145999	146000	145996	145997	Mr. Pip	249	” “
146010	146011	144897	144898	Mrs. Brandley	358	” “
146016	146224	146228	146228	your	2971	” returned the voice . And the man came on . I stood with my lamp held out over the stair - rail , and he came slowly within its light . It was a shaded lamp , to shine upon a book , and its circle of light was very contracted ; so that he was in it for a mere instant , and then out of it . In the instant , I had seen a face that was strange to me , looking up with an incomprehensible air of being touched and pleased by the sight of me . Moving the lamp as the man moved , I made out that he was substantially dressed , but roughly , like a voyager by sea . That he had long iron - grey hair . That his age was about sixty . That he was a muscular man , strong on his legs , and that he was browned and hardened by exposure to weather . As he ascended the last stair or two , and the light of my lamp included us both , I saw , with a stupid kind of amazement , that he was holding out both his hands to me . “
146231	146236	146237	146237	My	0	” I asked him . “
146240	146246	146237	146237	My	0	” he repeated , pausing . “
146261	146262	146258	146258	your	0	” “
146270	146271	146264	146264	you	2971	” “
146274	146278	146264	146264	you	2971	” he replied ; “
146287	146459	146462	146462	you	2973	” I had asked him the question inhospitably enough , for I resented the sort of bright and gratified recognition that still shone in his face . I resented it , because it seemed to imply that he expected me to respond to it . But I took him into the room I had just left , and , having set the lamp on the table , asked him as civilly as I could to explain himself . He looked about him with the strangest air,—an air of wondering pleasure , as if he had some part in the things he admired,—and he pulled off a rough outer coat , and his hat . Then , I saw that his head was furrowed and bald , and that the long iron - grey hair grew only on its sides . But , I saw nothing that in the least explained him . On the contrary , I saw him next moment , once more holding out both his hands to me . “
146465	146494	146462	146462	you	2973	” said I , half suspecting him to be mad . He stopped in his looking at me , and slowly rubbed his right hand over his head . “
146502	146512	146513	146513	arter	2973	” he said , in a coarse broken voice , “
146557	146602	146541	146541	I	0	” He sat down on a chair that stood before the fire , and covered his forehead with his large brown veinous hands . I looked at him attentively then , and recoiled a little from him ; but I did not know him . “
146609	146618	146605	146606	no one	4527	” said he , looking over his shoulder ; “
146622	146623	146605	146606	no one	4527	” “
146645	146648	146626	146626	you	0	” said I. “
146655	146677	146649	146649	You	462	” he returned , shaking his head at me with a deliberate affection , at once most unintelligible and most exasperating ; “
146708	146942	146698	146698	You	462	” I relinquished the intention he had detected , for I knew him ! Even yet I could not recall a single feature , but I knew him ! If the wind and the rain had driven away the intervening years , had scattered all the intervening objects , had swept us to the churchyard where we first stood face to face on such different levels , I could not have known my convict more distinctly than I knew him now as he sat in the chair before the fire . No need to take a file from his pocket and show it to me ; no need to take the handkerchief from his neck and twist it round his head ; no need to hug himself with both his arms , and take a shivering turn across the room , looking back at me for recognition . I knew him before he gave me one of those aids , though , a moment before , I had not been conscious of remotely suspecting his identity . He came back to where I stood , and again held out both his hands . Not knowing what to do,—for , in my astonishment I had lost my self - possession,—I reluctantly gave him my hands . He grasped them heartily , raised them to his lips , kissed them , and still held them . “
146950	146954	146955	146955	Noble	368	” said he . “
146966	146995	146960	146960	I	0	” At a change in his manner as if he were even going to embrace me , I laid a hand upon his breast and put him away . “
146998	147001	147006	147006	you	249	” said I. “
147089	147114	147115	147115	You	249	” My attention was so attracted by the singularity of his fixed look at me , that the words died away on my tongue . “
147121	147134	147115	147115	You	249	” he observed , when we had confronted one another in silence , “
147148	147149	147145	147145	I	0	” “
147238	147262	147263	147263	I	0	” He had replaced his neckerchief loosely , and had stood , keenly observant of me , biting a long end of it . “
147266	147283	147263	147263	I	0	” he answered , still with the end at his mouth and still observant of me , “
147299	147458	147459	147459	I	0	” There was a tray ready on a side - table . I brought it to the table near the fire , and asked him what he would have ? He touched one of the bottles without looking at it or speaking , and I made him some hot rum and water . I tried to keep my hand steady while I did so , but his look at me as he leaned back in his chair with the long draggled end of his neckerchief between his teeth — evidently forgotten — made my hand very difficult to master . When at last I put the glass to him , I saw with amazement that his eyes were full of tears . Up to this time I had remained standing , not to disguise that I wished him gone . But I was softened by the softened aspect of the man , and felt a touch of reproach . “
147462	147483	147459	147459	I	0	” said I , hurriedly putting something into a glass for myself , and drawing a chair to the table , “
147522	147578	147515	147515	I	0	” As I put my glass to my lips , he glanced with surprise at the end of his neckerchief , dropping from his mouth when he opened it , and stretched out his hand . I gave him mine , and then he drank , and drew his sleeve across his eyes and forehead . “
147584	147589	147581	147581	you	2986	” I asked him . “
147612	147616	147515	147515	I	0	” said he ; “
147628	147629	147630	147630	I	0	” “
147637	147638	147630	147630	I	0	” “
147675	147676	147677	147677	I	0	” “
147684	147685	147677	147677	I	0	” “
147698	147730	147690	147690	you	2986	” Without stopping to try to understand those words or the tone in which they were spoken , I turned off to a point that had just come into my mind . “
147743	147747	147735	147741	a messenger you once sent to me	2992	” I inquired , “
147754	147755	147762	147762	I	0	” “
147768	147769	147762	147762	I	0	” “
147839	147934	147827	147827	You	2986	” I took out my purse . He watched me as I laid my purse upon the table and opened it , and he watched me as I separated two one - pound notes from its contents . They were clean and new , and I spread them out and handed them over to him . Still watching me , he laid them one upon the other , folded them long - wise , gave them a twist , set fire to them at the lamp , and dropped the ashes into the tray . “
147941	147965	147936	147936	I	0	” he said then , with a smile that was like a frown , and with a frown that was like a smile , “
147989	147990	147980	147980	me	0	” “
147993	147994	147980	147980	me	0	” “
147997	148121	147980	147980	me	0	” He emptied his glass , got up , and stood at the side of the fire , with his heavy brown hand on the mantel - shelf . He put a foot up to the bars , to dry and warm it , and the wet boot began to steam ; but , he neither looked at it , nor at the fire , but steadily looked at me . It was only now that I began to tremble . When my lips had parted , and had shaped some words that were without sound , I forced myself to tell him ( though I could not do it distinctly ) , that I had been chosen to succeed to some property . “
148130	148137	148138	148138	I	0	” said he . I faltered , “
148143	148144	148138	148138	I	0	” “
148153	148161	148162	148162	I	0	” said he . I faltered again , “
148167	148168	148162	148162	I	0	” “
148178	148183	148170	148170	I	0	” said the Convict , “
148202	148238	148195	148197	the first figure	2998	” With my heart beating like a heavy hammer of disordered action , I rose out of my chair , and stood with my hand upon the back of it , looking wildly at him . “
148243	148248	148240	148241	a guardian	2999	” he went on . “
148290	148338	148288	148288	J	369	” All the truth of my position came flashing on me ; and its disappointments , dangers , disgraces , consequences of all kinds , rushed in in such a multitude that I was borne down by them and had to struggle for every breath I drew . “
148342	148346	148288	148288	J	369	” he resumed , “
148440	148551	148438	148438	Wemmick	269	” I could not have spoken one word , though it had been to save my life . I stood , with a hand on the chair - back and a hand on my breast , where I seemed to be suffocating,—I stood so , looking wildly at him , until I grasped at the chair , when the room began to surge and turn . He caught me , drew me to the sofa , put me up against the cushions , and bent on one knee before me , bringing the face that I now well remembered , and that I shuddered at , very near to mine . “
148694	148733	148688	148688	Pip	249	” The abhorrence in which I held the man , the dread I had of him , the repugnance with which I shrank from him , could not have been exceeded if he had been some terrible beast . “
148957	148996	148944	148944	You	3010	” In his heat and triumph , and in his knowledge that I had been nearly fainting , he did not remark on my reception of all this . It was the one grain of relief I had . “
149000	149037	149038	149044	a gold ’ un and a beauty	3033	” he went on , taking my watch out of my pocket , and turning towards him a ring on my finger , while I recoiled from his touch as if he had been a snake , “
149102	149110	149098	149098	your	3036	” turning his eyes round the room , “
149184	149206	149173	149173	I	0	” Again he took both my hands and put them to his lips , while my blood ran cold within me . “
149215	149257	149258	149258	you	3036	” said he , after again drawing his sleeve over his eyes and forehead , as the click came in his throat which I well remembered,—and he was all the more horrible to me that he was so much in earnest ; “
149302	149303	149294	149294	you	3036	” “
149311	149315	149294	149294	you	3036	” I returned , “
149320	149321	149294	149294	you	3036	” “
149350	149351	149347	149348	Mr. Jaggers	245	” “
149358	149362	149354	149356	no one else	744	” I asked . “
149365	149375	149354	149356	no one else	744	” said he , with a glance of surprise : “
149416	149422	149410	149410	you	3036	” O Estella , Estella ! “
149622	149647	149611	149611	he	245	” O that he had never come ! That he had left me at the forge,—far from contented , yet , by comparison happy ! “
149847	149875	149823	149823	I	0	” He laid his hand on my shoulder . I shuddered at the thought that for anything I knew , his hand might be stained with blood . “
149937	149992	149933	149933	I	0	” I tried to collect my thoughts , but I was stunned . Throughout , I had seemed to myself to attend more to the wind and the rain than to him ; even now , I could not separate his voice from those voices , though those were loud and his was silent . “
149999	150005	149995	149995	you	0	” he asked , presently . “
150015	150016	149995	149995	you	0	” “
150020	150023	149995	149995	you	0	” said I. “
150033	150037	149995	149995	you	0	” he answered ; “
150054	150055	150056	150056	My	0	” “
150061	150070	150056	150056	My	0	” said I , rising from the sofa , “
150080	150081	150082	150082	He	638	” “
150094	150095	150082	150082	He	638	” “
150098	150113	150082	150082	He	638	” said I , answering almost mechanically , in spite of my utmost efforts ; “
150119	150120	150082	150082	He	638	” “
150129	150150	150159	150159	you	0	” he said , dropping his voice , and laying a long finger on my breast in an impressive manner , “
150155	150156	150159	150159	you	0	” “
150164	150165	150159	150159	you	0	” “
150175	150176	150159	150159	you	0	” “
150181	150182	150183	150183	I	0	” “
150217	150461	150207	150207	I	0	” Nothing was needed but this ; the wretched man , after loading wretched me with his gold and silver chains for years , had risked his life to come to me , and I held it there in my keeping ! If I had loved him instead of abhorring him ; if I had been attracted to him by the strongest admiration and affection , instead of shrinking from him with the strongest repugnance ; it could have been no worse . On the contrary , it would have been better , for his preservation would then have naturally and tenderly addressed my heart . My first care was to close the shutters , so that no light might be seen from without , and then to close and make fast the doors . While I did so , he stood at the table drinking rum and eating biscuit ; and when I saw him thus engaged , I saw my convict on the marshes at his meal again . It almost seemed to me as if he must stoop down presently , to file at his leg . When I had gone into Herbert ’s room , and had shut off any other communication between it and the staircase than through the room in which our conversation had been held , I asked him if he would go to bed ? He said yes , but asked me for some of my “
150465	151758	150207	150207	I	0	” to put on in the morning . I brought it out , and laid it ready for him , and my blood again ran cold when he again took me by both hands to give me good - night . I got away from him , without knowing how I did it , and mended the fire in the room where we had been together , and sat down by it , afraid to go to bed . For an hour or more , I remained too stunned to think ; and it was not until I began to think , that I began fully to know how wrecked I was , and how the ship in which I had sailed was gone to pieces . Miss Havisham ’s intentions towards me , all a mere dream ; Estella not designed for me ; I only suffered in Satis House as a convenience , a sting for the greedy relations , a model with a mechanical heart to practise on when no other practice was at hand ; those were the first smarts I had . But , sharpest and deepest pain of all,—it was for the convict , guilty of I knew not what crimes , and liable to be taken out of those rooms where I sat thinking , and hanged at the Old Bailey door , that I had deserted Joe . I would not have gone back to Joe now , I would not have gone back to Biddy now , for any consideration ; simply , I suppose , because my sense of my own worthless conduct to them was greater than every consideration . No wisdom on earth could have given me the comfort that I should have derived from their simplicity and fidelity ; but I could never , never , undo what I had done . In every rage of wind and rush of rain , I heard pursuers . Twice , I could have sworn there was a knocking and whispering at the outer door . With these fears upon me , I began either to imagine or recall that I had had mysterious warnings of this man ’s approach . That , for weeks gone by , I had passed faces in the streets which I had thought like his . That these likenesses had grown more numerous , as he , coming over the sea , had drawn nearer . That his wicked spirit had somehow sent these messengers to mine , and that now on this stormy night he was as good as his word , and with me . Crowding up with these reflections came the reflection that I had seen him with my childish eyes to be a desperately violent man ; that I had heard that other convict reiterate that he had tried to murder him ; that I had seen him down in the ditch tearing and fighting like a wild beast . Out of such remembrances I brought into the light of the fire a half - formed terror that it might not be safe to be shut up there with him in the dead of the wild solitary night . This dilated until it filled the room , and impelled me to take a candle and go in and look at my dreadful burden . He had rolled a handkerchief round his head , and his face was set and lowering in his sleep . But he was asleep , and quietly too , though he had a pistol lying on the pillow . Assured of this , I softly removed the key to the outside of his door , and turned it on him before I again sat down by the fire . Gradually I slipped from the chair and lay on the floor . When I awoke without having parted in my sleep with the perception of my wretchedness , the clocks of the Eastward churches were striking five , the candles were wasted out , the fire was dead , and the wind and rain intensified the thick black darkness . THIS IS THE END OF THE SECOND STAGE OF PIP ’S EXPECTATIONS . Chapter XL . It was fortunate for me that I had to take precautions to ensure ( so far as I could ) the safety of my dreaded visitor ; for , this thought pressing on me when I awoke , held other thoughts in a confused concourse at a distance . The impossibility of keeping him concealed in the chambers was self - evident . It could not be done , and the attempt to do it would inevitably engender suspicion . True , I had no Avenger in my service now , but I was looked after by an inflammatory old female , assisted by an animated rag - bag whom she called her niece , and to keep a room secret from them would be to invite curiosity and exaggeration . They both had weak eyes , which I had long attributed to their chronically looking in at keyholes , and they were always at hand when not wanted ; indeed that was their only reliable quality besides larceny . Not to get up a mystery with these people , I resolved to announce in the morning that my uncle had unexpectedly come from the country . This course I decided on while I was yet groping about in the darkness for the means of getting a light . Not stumbling on the means after all , I was fain to go out to the adjacent Lodge and get the watchman there to come with his lantern . Now , in groping my way down the black staircase I fell over something , and that something was a man crouching in a corner . As the man made no answer when I asked him what he did there , but eluded my touch in silence , I ran to the Lodge and urged the watchman to come quickly ; telling him of the incident on the way back . The wind being as fierce as ever , we did not care to endanger the light in the lantern by rekindling the extinguished lamps on the staircase , but we examined the staircase from the bottom to the top and found no one there . It then occurred to me as possible that the man might have slipped into my rooms ; so , lighting my candle at the watchman ’s , and leaving him standing at the door , I examined them carefully , including the room in which my dreaded guest lay asleep . All was quiet , and assuredly no other man was in those chambers . It troubled me that there should have been a lurker on the stairs , on that night of all nights in the year , and I asked the watchman , on the chance of eliciting some hopeful explanation as I handed him a dram at the door , whether he had admitted at his gate any gentleman who had perceptibly been dining out ? Yes , he said ; at different times of the night , three . One lived in Fountain Court , and the other two lived in the Lane , and he had seen them all go home . Again , the only other man who dwelt in the house of which my chambers formed a part had been in the country for some weeks , and he certainly had not returned in the night , because we had seen his door with his seal on it as we came upstairs . “
151767	151780	151765	151765	sir	4442	” said the watchman , as he gave me back my glass , “
151818	151819	151812	151813	a stranger	1300	” “
151823	151827	151812	151813	a stranger	1300	” I muttered . “
151830	151831	151812	151813	a stranger	1300	” “
151838	151839	151836	151836	sir	4442	” “
151845	151846	151848	151849	the person	1825	” “
151853	151854	151848	151849	the person	1825	” “
151859	151863	151857	151857	him	1300	” I repeated . “
151873	151878	151864	151864	I	0	” returned the watchman . “
151904	151905	151899	151899	he	1825	” “
151911	152488	152489	152489	I	0	” The watchman had not particularly noticed ; he should say a working person ; to the best of his belief , he had a dust - coloured kind of clothes on , under a dark coat . The watchman made more light of the matter than I did , and naturally ; not having my reason for attaching weight to it . When I had got rid of him , which I thought it well to do without prolonging explanations , my mind was much troubled by these two circumstances taken together . Whereas they were easy of innocent solution apart,—as , for instance , some diner out or diner at home , who had not gone near this watchman ’s gate , might have strayed to my staircase and dropped asleep there,—and my nameless visitor might have brought some one with him to show him the way,—still , joined , they had an ugly look to one as prone to distrust and fear as the changes of a few hours had made me . I lighted my fire , which burnt with a raw pale flare at that time of the morning , and fell into a doze before it . I seemed to have been dozing a whole night when the clocks struck six . As there was full an hour and a half between me and daylight , I dozed again ; now , waking up uneasily , with prolix conversations about nothing , in my ears ; now , making thunder of the wind in the chimney ; at length , falling off into a profound sleep from which the daylight woke me with a start . All this time I had never been able to consider my own situation , nor could I do so yet . I had not the power to attend to it . I was greatly dejected and distressed , but in an incoherent wholesale sort of way . As to forming any plan for the future , I could as soon have formed an elephant . When I opened the shutters and looked out at the wet wild morning , all of a leaden hue ; when I walked from room to room ; when I sat down again shivering , before the fire , waiting for my laundress to appear ; I thought how miserable I was , but hardly knew why , or how long I had been so , or on what day of the week I made the reflection , or even who I was that made it . At last , the old woman and the niece came in,—the latter with a head not easily distinguishable from her dusty broom,—and testified surprise at sight of me and the fire . To whom I imparted how my uncle had come in the night and was then asleep , and how the breakfast preparations were to be modified accordingly . Then I washed and dressed while they knocked the furniture about and made a dust ; and so , in a sort of dream or sleep - waking , I found myself sitting by the fire again , waiting for — Him — to come to breakfast . By and by , his door opened and he came out . I could not bring myself to bear the sight of him , and I thought he had a worse look by daylight . “
152495	152510	152489	152489	I	0	” said I , speaking low as he took his seat at the table , “
152528	152529	152518	152518	I	0	” “
152541	152542	152539	152539	uncle	703	” “

152607	152615	152616	152616	Magwitch	371	” I asked him in a whisper . “
152618	152627	152616	152616	Magwitch	371	” he answered , in the same tone ; “
152631	152632	152629	152629	Abel	371	” “
152641	152642	152646	152647	dear boy	3010	” “
152649	152666	152646	152647	dear boy	3010	” He answered quite seriously , and used the word as if it denoted some profession . “
152676	152698	152668	152668	you	3083	” said I , pausing to wonder whether that could really have been last night , which seemed so long ago . “
152704	152705	152668	152668	you	3083	” “
152728	152729	152722	152722	you	3010	” “

152756	152762	152749	152749	I	0	” he said , dubiously , “
152788	152789	152778	152779	a person	3097	” “
152796	152797	152791	152791	you	3083	” “
152802	152822	152791	152791	you	3083	” said he , giving his neck a jerk with his forefinger that made me turn hot and sick . “
152831	152832	152824	152824	you	3083	” “
152848	152849	152851	152851	you	3083	” “

152863	152872	152851	152851	you	3083	” said he , with a sharp look . “
152877	152881	152851	152851	you	3083	” He nodded . “
152894	152926	152889	152889	Jaggers	245	” It was on my lips to ask him what he was tried for , but he took up a knife , gave it a flourish , and with the words , “
152938	153056	153057	153057	I	0	” fell to at his breakfast . He ate in a ravenous way that was very disagreeable , and all his actions were uncouth , noisy , and greedy . Some of his teeth had failed him since I saw him eat on the marshes , and as he turned his food in his mouth , and turned his head sideways to bring his strongest fangs to bear upon it , he looked terribly like a hungry old dog . If I had begun with any appetite , he would have taken it away , and I should have sat much as I did,—repelled from him by an insurmountable aversion , and gloomily looking at the cloth . “
153066	153085	153057	153057	I	0	” he said , as a polite kind of apology when he made an end of his meal , “
153160	153283	153308	153309	the gentleman	1390	” As he said so , he got up from table , and putting his hand into the breast of the pea - coat he wore , brought out a short black pipe , and a handful of loose tobacco of the kind that is called Negro - head . Having filled his pipe , he put the surplus tobacco back again , as if his pocket were a drawer . Then , he took a live coal from the fire with the tongs , and lighted his pipe at it , and then turned round on the hearth - rug with his back to the fire , and went through his favourite action of holding out both his hands for mine . “
153287	153305	153308	153309	the gentleman	1390	” said he , dandling my hands up and down in his , as he puffed at his pipe,—“and
153348	153416	153417	153417	I	0	” I released my hands as soon as I could , and found that I was beginning slowly to settle down to the contemplation of my condition . What I was chained to , and how heavily , became intelligible to me , as I heard his hoarse voice , and sat looking up at his furrowed bald head with its iron grey hair at the sides . “
153520	153545	153514	153514	Pip	249	” He took out of his pocket a great thick pocket - book , bursting with papers , and tossed it on the table . “
153639	153658	153660	153660	you	249	” he wound up , looking round the room and snapping his fingers once with a loud snap , “
153695	153696	153680	153680	I	0	” “
153699	153712	153680	153680	I	0	” said I , almost in a frenzy of fear and dislike , “
153757	153758	153759	153759	Look’ee	372	” “
153764	153782	153762	153762	Pip	249	” said he , laying his hand on my arm in a suddenly altered and subdued manner ; “
153831	153832	153821	153821	I	0	” “
153835	153842	153821	153821	I	0	” I resumed , half groaning , “
153855	153856	153815	153815	Pip	249	” “
153862	153873	153815	153815	Pip	249	” he said , in the same tone as before , “
153929	153948	153949	153949	I	0	” Some sense of the grimly - ludicrous moved me to a fretful laugh , as I replied , “
153968	153969	153949	153949	I	0	” “
153976	153980	153981	153982	Dear boy	3010	” he persisted . “

154090	154093	154005	154005	You	3010	” said I. “
154096	154100	154005	154005	You	3010	” he returned , “
154176	154177	154160	154160	I	0	” “
154185	154186	154160	154160	I	0	” “
154190	154212	154213	154213	I	0	” said he , taking his black pipe from his mouth , and dropping his jaw as he stared at me . “
154227	154228	154221	154221	I	0	” “
154235	154238	154221	154221	I	0	” said I. “
154253	154254	154255	154256	Dear boy	3010	” “
154258	154262	154255	154256	Dear boy	3010	” he returned , “
154328	154329	154322	154322	your	3010	” “
154336	154340	154330	154330	You	249	” said I , “
154356	154357	154350	154350	you	249	” “
154366	154378	154360	154360	I	0	” said he , putting his pipe back in his mouth , “
154541	154694	154532	154532	me	0	” Once more , he took me by both hands and surveyed me with an air of admiring proprietorship : smoking with great complacency all the while . It appeared to me that I could do no better than secure him some quiet lodging hard by , of which he might take possession when Herbert returned : whom I expected in two or three days . That the secret must be confided to Herbert as a matter of unavoidable necessity , even if I could have put the immense relief I should derive from sharing it with him out of the question , was plain to me . But it was by no means so plain to Mr. Provis ( I resolved to call him by that name ) , who reserved his consent to Herbert ’s participation until he should have seen him and formed a favourable judgment of his physiognomy . “
154702	154718	154532	154532	me	0	” said he , pulling a greasy little clasped black Testament out of his pocket , “
154727	154919	154532	154532	me	0	” To state that my terrible patron carried this little black book about the world solely to swear people on in cases of emergency , would be to state what I never quite established ; but this I can say , that I never knew him put it to any other use . The book itself had the appearance of having been stolen from some court of justice , and perhaps his knowledge of its antecedents , combined with his own experience in that wise , gave him a reliance on its powers as a sort of legal spell or charm . On this first occasion of his producing it , I recalled how he had made me swear fidelity in the churchyard long ago , and how he had described himself last night as always swearing to his resolutions in his solitude . As he was at present dressed in a seafaring slop suit , in which he looked as if he had some parrots and cigars to dispose of , I next discussed with him what dress he should wear . He cherished an extraordinary belief in the virtues of “
154921	155212	154532	154532	me	0	” as a disguise , and had in his own mind sketched a dress for himself that would have made him something between a dean and a dentist . It was with considerable difficulty that I won him over to the assumption of a dress more like a prosperous farmer ’s ; and we arranged that he should cut his hair close , and wear a little powder . Lastly , as he had not yet been seen by the laundress or her niece , he was to keep himself out of their view until his change of dress was made . It would seem a simple matter to decide on these precautions ; but in my dazed , not to say distracted , state , it took so long , that I did not get out to further them until two or three in the afternoon . He was to remain shut up in the chambers while I was gone , and was on no account to open the door . There being to my knowledge a respectable lodging - house in Essex Street , the back of which looked into the Temple , and was almost within hail of my windows , I first of all repaired to that house , and was so fortunate as to secure the second floor for my uncle , Mr. Provis . I then went from shop to shop , making such purchases as were necessary to the change in his appearance . This business transacted , I turned my face , on my own account , to Little Britain . Mr. Jaggers was at his desk , but , seeing me enter , got up immediately and stood before his fire . “
155217	155221	155215	155215	Pip	249	” said he , “
155225	155226	155227	155227	I	0	” “
155232	155252	155227	155227	I	0	” I returned . For , coming along I had thought well of what I was going to say . “
155258	155263	155256	155256	yourself	249	” said Mr. Jaggers , “

155317	155321	155314	155315	Mr. Jaggers	245	” said I , “
155351	155356	155359	155359	you	0	” Mr. Jaggers nodded . “
155369	155397	155359	155359	you	0	” he asked me , with his head on one side , and not looking at me , but looking in a listening way at the floor . “

155539	155559	155534	155534	you	4442	” returned Mr. Jaggers , turning his eyes upon me coolly , and taking a bite at his forefinger , “
155569	155570	155560	155560	I	0	” “
155581	155589	155579	155579	sir	4442	” I pleaded with a downcast heart . “
155598	155612	155596	155596	Pip	249	” said Mr. Jaggers , shaking his head and gathering up his skirts . “
155630	155631	155632	155632	I	0	” “
155639	155655	155632	155632	I	0	” said I , with a sigh , after standing silent for a little while . “

155684	155689	155682	155682	himself	371	” said Mr. Jaggers , “

155884	155894	155878	155878	I	0	” said Mr. Jaggers , looking hard at me ; “

155917	155920	155903	155903	He	371	” said I. “
155928	155939	155926	155926	Wemmick	269	” pursued Mr. Jaggers , still looking hard at me , “
155962	155963	155952	155958	a colonist of the name of Purvis	3158	” “
155967	155971	155952	155958	a colonist of the name of Purvis	3158	” I suggested . “
155994	155995	155988	155988	you	249	” “
155998	156001	155988	155988	you	249	” said I. “

156077	156081	156063	156063	Magwitch	371	” I replied . “
156087	156096	156063	156063	Magwitch	371	” said Mr. Jaggers , offering his hand ; “
156162	156223	156160	156160	Pip	249	” We shook hands , and he looked hard at me as long as he could see me . I turned at the door , and he was still looking hard at me , while the two vile casts on the shelf seemed to be trying to get their eyelids open , and to force out of their swollen throats , “
156232	157049	156160	156160	Pip	249	” Wemmick was out , and though he had been at his desk he could have done nothing for me . I went straight back to the Temple , where I found the terrible Provis drinking rum and water and smoking negro - head , in safety . Next day the clothes I had ordered all came home , and he put them on . Whatever he put on , became him less ( it dismally seemed to me ) than what he had worn before . To my thinking , there was something in him that made it hopeless to attempt to disguise him . The more I dressed him and the better I dressed him , the more he looked like the slouching fugitive on the marshes . This effect on my anxious fancy was partly referable , no doubt , to his old face and manner growing more familiar to me ; but I believe too that he dragged one of his legs as if there were still a weight of iron on it , and that from head to foot there was Convict in the very grain of the man . The influences of his solitary hut - life were upon him besides , and gave him a savage air that no dress could tame ; added to these were the influences of his subsequent branded life among men , and , crowning all , his consciousness that he was dodging and hiding now . In all his ways of sitting and standing , and eating and drinking,—of brooding about in a high - shouldered reluctant style,—of taking out his great horn - handled jackknife and wiping it on his legs and cutting his food,—of lifting light glasses and cups to his lips , as if they were clumsy pannikins,—of chopping a wedge off his bread , and soaking up with it the last fragments of gravy round and round his plate , as if to make the most of an allowance , and then drying his finger - ends on it , and then swallowing it,—in these ways and a thousand other small nameless instances arising every minute in the day , there was Prisoner , Felon , Bondsman , plain as plain could be . It had been his own idea to wear that touch of powder , and I had conceded the powder after overcoming the shorts . But I can compare the effect of it , when on , to nothing but the probable effect of rouge upon the dead ; so awful was the manner in which everything in him that it was most desirable to repress , started through that thin layer of pretence , and seemed to come blazing out at the crown of his head . It was abandoned as soon as tried , and he wore his grizzled hair cut short . Words can not tell what a sense I had , at the same time , of the dreadful mystery that he was to me . When he fell asleep of an evening , with his knotted hands clenching the sides of the easy - chair , and his bald head tattooed with deep wrinkles falling forward on his breast , I would sit and look at him , wondering what he had done , and loading him with all the crimes in the Calendar , until the impulse was powerful on me to start up and fly from him . Every hour so increased my abhorrence of him , that I even think I might have yielded to this impulse in the first agonies of being so haunted , notwithstanding all he had done for me and the risk he ran , but for the knowledge that Herbert must soon come back . Once , I actually did start out of bed in the night , and begin to dress myself in my worst clothes , hurriedly intending to leave him there with everything else I possessed , and enlist for India as a private soldier . I doubt if a ghost could have been more terrible to me , up in those lonely rooms in the long evenings and long nights , with the wind and the rain always rushing by . A ghost could not have been taken and hanged on my account , and the consideration that he could be , and the dread that he would be , were no small addition to my horrors . When he was not asleep , or playing a complicated kind of Patience with a ragged pack of cards of his own,—a game that I never saw before or since , and in which he recorded his winnings by sticking his jackknife into the table,—when he was not engaged in either of these pursuits , he would ask me to read to him,—“Foreign
157055	157282	156160	156160	Pip	249	” While I complied , he , not comprehending a single word , would stand before the fire surveying me with the air of an Exhibitor , and I would see him , between the fingers of the hand with which I shaded my face , appealing in dumb show to the furniture to take notice of my proficiency . The imaginary student pursued by the misshapen creature he had impiously made , was not more wretched than I , pursued by the creature who had made me , and recoiling from him with a stronger repulsion , the more he admired me and the fonder he was of me . This is written of , I am sensible , as if it had lasted a year . It lasted about five days . Expecting Herbert all the time , I dared not go out , except when I took Provis for an airing after dark . At length , one evening when dinner was over and I had dropped into a slumber quite worn out,—for my nights had been agitated and my rest broken by fearful dreams,—I was roused by the welcome footstep on the staircase . Provis , who had been asleep too , staggered up at the noise I made , and in an instant I saw his jackknife shining in his hand . “
157289	157312	157287	157287	Herbert	282	” I said ; and Herbert came bursting in , with the airy freshness of six hundred miles of France upon him . “
157372	157417	157365	157365	Halloa	164	” He was stopped in his running on and in his shaking hands with me , by seeing Provis . Provis , regarding him with a fixed attention , was slowly putting up his jackknife , and groping in another pocket for something else . “
157424	157440	157369	157369	your	3163	” said I , shutting the double doors , while Herbert stood staring and wondering , “
157455	157456	157450	157453	a visitor of mine	3165	” “
157465	157485	157450	157453	a visitor of mine	3165	” said Provis coming forward , with his little clasped black book , and then addressing himself to Herbert . “
157513	157514	157519	157519	he	282	” “
157523	157555	157519	157519	he	282	” I said to Herbert . So , Herbert , looking at me with a friendly uneasiness and amazement , complied , and Provis immediately shaking hands with him , said , “
157583	157691	157574	157574	Pip	249	” Chapter XLI . In vain should I attempt to describe the astonishment and disquiet of Herbert , when he and I and Provis sat down before the fire , and I recounted the whole of the secret . Enough , that I saw my own feelings reflected in Herbert ’s face , and not least among them , my repugnance towards the man who had done so much for me . What would alone have set a division between that man and us , if there had been no other dividing circumstance , was his triumph in my story . Saving his troublesome sense of having been “
157693	157803	157847	157847	I	0	” on one occasion since his return,—on which point he began to hold forth to Herbert , the moment my revelation was finished,—he had no perception of the possibility of my finding any fault with my good fortune . His boast that he had made me a gentleman , and that he had come to see me support the character on his ample resources , was made for me quite as much as for himself . And that it was a highly agreeable boast to both of us , and that we must both be very proud of it , was a conclusion quite established in his own mind . “
157813	157826	157809	157811	Pip ’s comrade	3169	” he said to Herbert , after having discoursed for some time , “
157955	157959	157950	157950	I	0	” Herbert said , “
157962	158431	157950	157950	I	0	” but looked as if there were no specific consolation in this , and remained perplexed and dismayed . We were anxious for the time when he would go to his lodging and leave us together , but he was evidently jealous of leaving us together , and sat late . It was midnight before I took him round to Essex Street , and saw him safely in at his own dark door . When it closed upon him , I experienced the first moment of relief I had known since the night of his arrival . Never quite free from an uneasy remembrance of the man on the stairs , I had always looked about me in taking my guest out after dark , and in bringing him back ; and I looked about me now . Difficult as it is in a large city to avoid the suspicion of being watched , when the mind is conscious of danger in that regard , I could not persuade myself that any of the people within sight cared about my movements . The few who were passing passed on their several ways , and the street was empty when I turned back into the Temple . Nobody had come out at the gate with us , nobody went in at the gate with me . As I crossed by the fountain , I saw his lighted back windows looking bright and quiet , and , when I stood for a few moments in the doorway of the building where I lived , before going up the stairs , Garden Court was as still and lifeless as the staircase was when I ascended it . Herbert received me with open arms , and I had never felt before so blessedly what it is to have a friend . When he had spoken some sound words of sympathy and encouragement , we sat down to consider the question , What was to be done ? The chair that Provis had occupied still remaining where it had stood,—for he had a barrack way with him of hanging about one spot , in one unsettled manner , and going through one round of observances with his pipe and his negro - head and his jackknife and his pack of cards , and what not , as if it were all put down for him on a slate,—I say his chair remaining where it had stood , Herbert unconsciously took it , but next moment started out of it , pushed it away , and took another . He had no occasion to say after that that he had conceived an aversion for my patron , neither had I occasion to confess my own . We interchanged that confidence without shaping a syllable . “
158434	158446	157950	157950	I	0	” said I to Herbert , when he was safe in another chair,—“what

158459	158467	158457	158457	Handel	284	” he replied , holding his head , “

158536	158544	158534	158534	I	0	” I interposed , as Herbert paused . “
158553	158563	158551	158551	him	282	” An involuntary shudder passed over both of us . “
158594	158595	158599	158599	Handel	284	” “
158601	158605	158599	158599	Handel	284	” Herbert repeated . “
158608	158612	158599	158599	Handel	284	” said I , “
158666	158667	158660	158660	I	0	” “
158674	158678	158660	158660	I	0	” Herbert remonstrated . “

158738	158766	158771	158771	Handel	284	” Of course I broke down there : and of course Herbert , beyond seizing a warm grip of my hand , pretended not to know it . “
158773	158778	158771	158771	Handel	284	” said he presently , “
158859	158870	158848	158848	I	0	” Poor fellow ! He little suspected with whose money . “
158877	158881	158884	158888	an ignorant , determined man	3181	” said Herbert . “

158947	158969	158941	158941	I	0	” And I told him what I had not mentioned in my narrative , of that encounter with the other convict . “
158974	158978	158925	158925	I	0	” said Herbert ; “
159048	159049	159036	159036	you	0	” “

159099	159103	159117	159117	his	3181	” said Herbert , “
159141	159289	159117	159117	his	3181	” I was so struck by the horror of this idea , which had weighed upon me from the first , and the working out of which would make me regard myself , in some sort , as his murderer , that I could not rest in my chair , but began pacing to and fro . I said to Herbert , meanwhile , that even if Provis were recognised and taken , in spite of himself , I should be wretched as the cause , however innocently . Yes ; even though I was so wretched in having him at large and near me , and even though I would far rather have worked at the forge all the days of my life than I would ever have come to this ! But there was no staving off the question , What was to be done ? “
159300	159304	159117	159117	his	3181	” said Herbert , “

I had the wildest dreams concerning him , and woke unrefreshed ; I woke , too , to recover the fear which I had lost in the night , of his being found out as a returned transport . Waking , I never lost that fear . He came round at the appointed time , took out his jackknife , and sat down to his meal . He was full of plans “

He put it back again , stuck his pipe in a button - hole of his coat , spread a hand on each knee , and after turning an angry eye on the fire for a few silent moments , looked round at us and said what follows . Chapter XLII . “
160347	160473	160342	160342	Pip	249	“ I ’ve been done everything to , pretty well — except hanged . I ’ve been locked up as much as a silver tea - kittle . I ’ve been carted here and carted there , and put out of this town , and put out of that town , and stuck in the stocks , and whipped and worried and drove . I ’ve no more notion where I was born than you have — if so much . I first become aware of myself down in Essex , a thieving turnips for my living . Summun had run away from me — a man — a tinker — and he ’d took the fire with him , and left me wery cold . “
160535	160602	160532	160532	mine	0	“ So fur as I could find , there warn’t a soul that see young Abel Magwitch , with us little on him as in him , but wot caught fright at him , and either drove him off , or took him up . I was took up , took up , took up , to that extent that I reg’larly grow’d up took up . “
160800	160958	160792	160792	you	3169	“ Tramping , begging , thieving , working sometimes when I could,—though that warn’t as often as you may think , till you put the question whether you would ha ’ been over - ready to give me work yourselves,—a bit of a poacher , a bit of a labourer , a bit of a wagoner , a bit of a haymaker , a bit of a hawker , a bit of most things that do n’t pay and lead to trouble , I got to be a man . A deserting soldier in a Traveller ’s Rest , what lay hid up to the chin under a lot of taturs , learnt me to read ; and a travelling Giant what signed his name at a penny a time learnt me to write . I warn’t locked up as often now as formerly , but I wore out my good share of key - metal still . “
161044	161172	161175	161175	he	381	“ He set up fur a gentleman , this Compeyson , and he ’d been to a public boarding - school and had learning . He was a smooth one to talk , and was a dab at the ways of gentlefolks . He was good - looking too . It was the night afore the great race , when I found him on the heath , in a booth that I know’d on . Him and some more was a sitting among the tables when I went in , and the landlord ( which had a knowledge of me , and was a sporting one ) called him out , and said , ‘ I think this is a man that might suit you,’—meaning I was . “
161210	161229	161188	161188	He	381	“ ‘ To judge from appearances , you ’re out of luck , ’ says Compeyson to me . “
161275	161293	161294	161294	I	0	“ ‘ Luck changes , ’ says Compeyson ; ‘ perhaps yours is going to change . ’ “
161310	161321	161328	161328	I	0	“ ‘ What can you do ? ’ says Compeyson . “
161340	161366	161328	161328	I	0	“ Compeyson laughed , looked at me again very noticing , giv me five shillings , and appointed me for next night . Same place . “
161488	161618	161478	161478	he	381	“ There was another in with Compeyson , as was called Arthur,—not as being so chrisen’d , but as a surname . He was in a Decline , and was a shadow to look at . Him and Compeyson had been in a bad thing with a rich lady some years afore , and they ’d made a pot of money by it ; but Compeyson betted and gamed , and he ’d have run through the king ’s taxes . So , Arthur was a dying , and a dying poor and with the horrors on him , and Compeyson ’s wife ( which Compeyson kicked mostly ) was a having pity on him when she could , and Compeyson was a having pity on nothing and nobody . “
161841	161888	161826	161826	she	7086	“ Says Compeyson : ‘ Why , you fool , do n’t you know she ’s got a living body ? And how should she be up there , without coming through the door , or in at the window , and up the stairs ? ’ “
161943	161991	161992	161992	Compeyson	381	“ Compeyson spoke hardy , but he was always a coward . ‘ Go up alonger this drivelling sick man , ’ he says to his wife , ‘ and Magwitch , lend her a hand , will you ? ’ But he never come nigh himself . “
162113	162232	162233	162233	He	3243	“ Compeyson ’s wife , being used to him , giv him some liquor to get the horrors off , and by and by he quieted . ‘ O , she ’s gone ! Has her keeper been for her ? ’ he says . ‘ Yes , ’ says Compeyson ’s wife . ‘ Did you tell him to lock her and bar her in ? ’ ‘ Yes . ’ ‘ And to take that ugly thing away from her ? ’ ‘ Yes , yes , all right . ’ ‘ You ’re a good creetur , ’ he says , ‘ do n’t leave me , whatever you do , and thank you ! ’ “
162365	162414	162355	162355	he	3243	“ Compeyson took it easy as a good riddance for both sides . Him and me was soon busy , and first he swore me ( being ever artful ) on my own book,—this here little black book , dear boy , what I swore your comrade on . “
162538	162590	162529	162529	I	0	” He looked about him in a confused way , as if he had lost his place in the book of his remembrance ; and he turned his face to the fire , and spread his hands broader on his knees , and lifted them off and put them on again . “
162601	162610	162529	162529	I	0	” he said , looking round once more . “
162652	162658	162635	162635	I	0	” I answered , No . “
162661	162665	162666	162666	I	0	” he said , “
162775	163361	163362	163362	He	3253	“ When we was put in the dock , I noticed first of all what a gentleman Compeyson looked , wi ’ his curly hair and his black clothes and his white pocket - handkercher , and what a common sort of a wretch I looked . When the prosecution opened and the evidence was put short , aforehand , I noticed how heavy it all bore on me , and how light on him . When the evidence was giv in the box , I noticed how it was always me that had come for’ard , and could be swore to , how it was always me that the money had been paid to , how it was always me that had seemed to work the thing and get the profit . But when the defence come on , then I see the plan plainer ; for , says the counsellor for Compeyson , ‘ My lord and gentlemen , here you has afore you , side by side , two persons as your eyes can separate wide ; one , the younger , well brought up , who will be spoke to as such ; one , the elder , ill brought up , who will be spoke to as such ; one , the younger , seldom if ever seen in these here transactions , and only suspected ; t’other , the elder , always seen in ’em and always wi ’ his guilt brought home . Can you doubt , if there is but one in it , which is the one , and , if there is two in it , which is much the worst one ? ’ And such - like . And when it come to character , warn’t it Compeyson as had been to the school , and warn’t it his schoolfellows as was in this position and in that , and warn’t it him as had been know’d by witnesses in such clubs and societies , and nowt to his disadvantage ? And warn’t it me as had been tried afore , and as had been know’d up hill and down dale in Bridewells and Lock - Ups ! And when it come to speech - making , warn’t it Compeyson as could speak to ’em wi ’ his face dropping every now and then into his white pocket - handkercher,—ah ! and wi ’ verses in his speech , too,—and warn’t it me as could only say , ‘ Gentlemen , this man at my side is a most precious rascal ’ ? And when the verdict come , warn’t it Compeyson as was recommended to mercy on account of good character and bad company , and giving up all the information he could agen me , and warn’t it me as got never a word but Guilty ? And when I says to Compeyson , ‘ Once out of this court , I ’ll smash that face of yourn ! ’ ai n’t it Compeyson as prays the Judge to be protected , and gets two turnkeys stood betwixt us ? And when we ’re sentenced , ai n’t it him as gets seven year , and me fourteen , and ai n’t it him as the Judge is sorry for , because he might a done so well , and ai n’t it me as the Judge perceives to be a old offender of wiolent passion , likely to come to worse ? ”
163403	163417	163418	163418	He	3253	“ I ai n’t a - going to be low , dear boy ! ”
163449	163587	163588	163588	He	3254	“ I had said to Compeyson that I ’d smash that face of his , and I swore Lord smash mine ! to do it . We was in the same prison - ship , but I could n’t get at him for long , though I tried . At last I come behind him and hit him on the cheek to turn him round and get a smashing one at him , when I was seen and seized . The black - hole of that ship warn’t a strong one , to a judge of black - holes that could swim and dive . I escaped to the shore , and I was a hiding among the graves there , envying them as was in ’em and all over , when I first see my boy ! ”
163614	163731	163598	163598	him	3254	“ By my boy , I was giv to understand as Compeyson was out on them marshes too . Upon my soul , I half believe he escaped in his terror , to get quit of me , not knowing it was me as had got ashore . I hunted him down . I smashed his face . ‘ And now , ’ says I ‘ as the worst thing I can do , caring nothing for myself , I ’ll drag you back . ’ And I ’d have swum off , towing him by the hair , if it had come to that , and I ’d a got him aboard without the soldiers . “
163804	163848	163787	163787	I	0	” He wiped himself again , as he had done before , and then slowly took his tangle of tobacco from his pocket , and plucked his pipe from his button - hole , and slowly filled it , and began to smoke . “
163853	163861	163850	163850	he	3255	” I asked , after a silence . “
163869	163870	163871	163871	Compeyson	381	” “
163873	163874	163875	163875	He	3255	” “

163907	163949	163899	163899	I	0	” Herbert had been writing with his pencil in the cover of a book . He softly pushed the book over to me , as Provis stood smoking with his eyes on the fire , and I read in it : — “
163970	165008	163959	163968	the man who professed to be Miss Havisham ’s lover	3260	” I shut the book and nodded slightly to Herbert , and put the book by ; but we neither of us said anything , and both looked at Provis as he stood smoking by the fire . Chapter XLIII . Why should I pause to ask how much of my shrinking from Provis might be traced to Estella ? Why should I loiter on my road , to compare the state of mind in which I had tried to rid myself of the stain of the prison before meeting her at the coach - office , with the state of mind in which I now reflected on the abyss between Estella in her pride and beauty , and the returned transport whom I harboured ? The road would be none the smoother for it , the end would be none the better for it , he would not be helped , nor I extenuated . A new fear had been engendered in my mind by his narrative ; or rather , his narrative had given form and purpose to the fear that was already there . If Compeyson were alive and should discover his return , I could hardly doubt the consequence . That Compeyson stood in mortal fear of him , neither of the two could know much better than I ; and that any such man as that man had been described to be would hesitate to release himself for good from a dreaded enemy by the safe means of becoming an informer was scarcely to be imagined . Never had I breathed , and never would I breathe — or so I resolved — a word of Estella to Provis . But , I said to Herbert that , before I could go abroad , I must see both Estella and Miss Havisham . This was when we were left alone on the night of the day when Provis told us his story . I resolved to go out to Richmond next day , and I went . On my presenting myself at Mrs. Brandley ’s , Estella ’s maid was called to tell that Estella had gone into the country . Where ? To Satis House , as usual . Not as usual , I said , for she had never yet gone there without me ; when was she coming back ? There was an air of reservation in the answer which increased my perplexity , and the answer was , that her maid believed she was only coming back at all for a little while . I could make nothing of this , except that it was meant that I should make nothing of it , and I went home again in complete discomfiture . Another night consultation with Herbert after Provis was gone home ( I always took him home , and always looked well about me ) , led us to the conclusion that nothing should be said about going abroad until I came back from Miss Havisham ’s . In the mean time , Herbert and I were to consider separately what it would be best to say ; whether we should devise any pretence of being afraid that he was under suspicious observation ; or whether I , who had never yet been abroad , should propose an expedition . We both knew that I had but to propose anything , and he would consent . We agreed that his remaining many days in his present hazard was not to be thought of . Next day I had the meanness to feign that I was under a binding promise to go down to Joe ; but I was capable of almost any meanness towards Joe or his name . Provis was to be strictly careful while I was gone , and Herbert was to take the charge of him that I had taken . I was to be absent only one night , and , on my return , the gratification of his impatience for my starting as a gentleman on a greater scale was to be begun . It occurred to me then , and as I afterwards found to Herbert also , that he might be best got away across the water , on that pretence,—as , to make purchases , or the like . Having thus cleared the way for my expedition to Miss Havisham ’s , I set off by the early morning coach before it was yet light , and was out on the open country road when the day came creeping on , halting and whimpering and shivering , and wrapped in patches of cloud and rags of mist , like a beggar . When we drove up to the Blue Boar after a drizzly ride , whom should I see come out under the gateway , toothpick in hand , to look at the coach , but Bentley Drummle ! As he pretended not to see me , I pretended not to see him . It was a very lame pretence on both sides ; the lamer , because we both went into the coffee - room , where he had just finished his breakfast , and where I ordered mine . It was poisonous to me to see him in the town , for I very well knew why he had come there . Pretending to read a smeary newspaper long out of date , which had nothing half so legible in its local news , as the foreign matter of coffee , pickles , fish sauces , gravy , melted butter , and wine with which it was sprinkled all over , as if it had taken the measles in a highly irregular form , I sat at my table while he stood before the fire . By degrees it became an enormous injury to me that he stood before the fire . And I got up , determined to have my share of it . I had to put my hand behind his legs for the poker when I went up to the fireplace to stir the fire , but still pretended not to know him . “
165014	165019	163959	163968	the man who professed to be Miss Havisham ’s lover	3260	” said Mr. Drummle . “
165022	165030	163959	163968	the man who professed to be Miss Havisham ’s lover	3260	” said I , poker in hand ; “
165056	165088	165089	165089	You	3262	” With that , I poked tremendously , and having done so , planted myself side by side with Mr. Drummle , my shoulders squared and my back to the fire . “
165095	165109	165089	165089	You	3262	” said Mr. Drummle , edging me a little away with his shoulder . “
165112	165129	165089	165089	You	3262	” said I , edging _ him _ a little away with _ my _ shoulder . “

165175	165207	165163	165163	your	0	” said Drummle . Here Mr. Drummle looked at his boots and I looked at mine , and then Mr. Drummle looked at my boots , and I looked at his . “
165214	165228	165209	165209	you	0	” I asked , determined not to yield an inch of the fire . “
165237	165249	165209	165209	you	0	” returned Drummle , pretending to yawn , but equally determined . “
165256	165257	165251	165251	you	0	” “
165262	165267	165269	165269	you	0	” answered Mr. Drummle . “

165277	165347	165269	165269	you	0	” said I. I felt here , through a tingling in my blood , that if Mr. Drummle ’s shoulder had claimed another hair ’s breadth of room , I should have jerked him into the window ; equally , that if my own shoulder had urged a similar claim , Mr. Drummle would have jerked me into the nearest box . He whistled a little . So did I. “
165358	165362	165355	165355	I	0	” said Drummle . “
165369	165388	165269	165269	you	0	” said I. Mr. Drummle looked at me , and then at my boots , and then said , “
165391	165395	165269	165269	you	0	” and laughed . “
165403	165404	165397	165397	you	0	” “
165407	165411	165397	165397	you	0	” said he , “

165547	165714	165545	165545	sir	4442	” Then , Drummle glanced at me , with an insolent triumph on his great - jowled face that cut me to the heart , dull as he was , and so exasperated me , that I felt inclined to take him in my arms ( as the robber in the story - book is said to have taken the old lady ) and seat him on the fire . One thing was manifest to both of us , and that was , that until relief came , neither of us could relinquish the fire . There we stood , well squared up before it , shoulder to shoulder and foot to foot , with our hands behind us , not budging an inch . The horse was visible outside in the drizzle at the door , my breakfast was put on the table , Drummle ’s was cleared away , the waiter invited me to begin , I nodded , we both stood our ground . “
165723	165727	165716	165716	you	3283	” said Drummle . “

165901	165910	165883	165883	I	0	” said he , superciliously over his shoulder ; “
165919	165920	165911	165911	I	0	” “
165924	165929	165931	165931	your	295	” I went on , “
165947	165948	165934	165934	I	0	” “
165953	165957	165934	165934	I	0	” said Drummle , “
165990	165991	165994	165994	you	0	” “
165999	166000	166001	166001	Waiter	3291	” “
166003	166017	166001	166001	Waiter	3291	” said Drummle , by way of answering me . The waiter reappeared . “
166048	166049	166053	166053	sir	4442	” “
166055	166532	166053	166053	sir	4442	” When the waiter had felt my fast - cooling teapot with the palm of his hand , and had looked imploringly at me , and had gone out , Drummle , careful not to move the shoulder next me , took a cigar from his pocket and bit the end off , but showed no sign of stirring . Choking and boiling as I was , I felt that we could not go a word further , without introducing Estella ’s name , which I could not endure to hear him utter ; and therefore I looked stonily at the opposite wall , as if there were no one present , and forced myself to silence . How long we might have remained in this ridiculous position it is impossible to say , but for the incursion of three thriving farmers — laid on by the waiter , I think — who came into the coffee - room unbuttoning their great - coats and rubbing their hands , and before whom , as they charged at the fire , we were obliged to give way . I saw him through the window , seizing his horse ’s mane , and mounting in his blundering brutal manner , and sidling and backing away . I thought he was gone , when he came back , calling for a light for the cigar in his mouth , which he had forgotten . A man in a dust - coloured dress appeared with what was wanted,—I could not have said from where : whether from the inn yard , or the street , or where not,—and as Drummle leaned down from the saddle and lighted his cigar and laughed , with a jerk of his head towards the coffee - room windows , the slouching shoulders and ragged hair of this man whose back was towards me reminded me of Orlick . Too heavily out of sorts to care much at the time whether it were he or no , or after all to touch the breakfast , I washed the weather and the journey from my face and hands , and went out to the memorable old house that it would have been so much the better for me never to have entered , never to have seen . Chapter XLIV . In the room where the dressing - table stood , and where the wax - candles burnt on the wall , I found Miss Havisham and Estella ; Miss Havisham seated on a settee near the fire , and Estella on a cushion at her feet . Estella was knitting , and Miss Havisham was looking on . They both raised their eyes as I went in , and both saw an alteration in me . I derived that , from the look they interchanged . “
166537	166542	166547	166547	Pip	249	” said Miss Havisham , “
166549	166619	166547	166547	Pip	249	” Though she looked steadily at me , I saw that she was rather confused . Estella , pausing a moment in her knitting with her eyes upon me , and then going on , I fancied that I read in the action of her fingers , as plainly as if she had told me in the dumb alphabet , that she perceived I had discovered my real benefactor . “
166623	166627	166620	166621	Miss Havisham	227	” said I , “
166654	166710	166651	166651	I	0	” Miss Havisham motioning to me for the third or fourth time to sit down , I took the chair by the dressing - table , which I had often seen her occupy . With all that ruin at my feet and about me , it seemed a natural place for me , that day . “
166761	166799	166800	166800	I	0	” Miss Havisham continued to look steadily at me . I could see in the action of Estella ’s fingers as they worked that she attended to what I said ; but she did not look up . “
166855	166878	166882	166882	your	196	” As I was silent for a while , looking at Estella and considering how to go on , Miss Havisham repeated , “
166891	166892	166894	166894	you	196	” “
166959	166960	166963	166963	Pip	249	” “
166965	166975	166976	166976	you	249	” replied Miss Havisham , steadily nodding her head ; “
166979	166980	166976	166976	you	249	” “
166986	166987	166983	166984	Mr. Jaggers	245	” “
166991	167004	166988	166989	Mr. Jaggers	245	” said Miss Havisham , taking me up in a firm tone , “
167070	167090	167107	167107	you	0	” Any one might have seen in her haggard face that there was no suppression or evasion so far . “
167112	167115	167107	167107	you	0	” said I. “
167118	167126	167127	167127	I	0	” she returned , again nodding steadily , “
167133	167134	167127	167127	I	0	” “
167139	167140	167127	167127	I	0	” “
167145	167169	167171	167171	I	0	” cried Miss Havisham , striking her stick upon the floor and flashing into wrath so suddenly that Estella glanced up at her in surprise,—“who
167184	167216	167127	167127	I	0	” It was a weak complaint to have made , and I had not meant to make it . I told her so , as she sat brooding after this outburst . “
167223	167227	167127	167127	I	0	” she said . “
167231	167232	167127	167127	I	0	” “
167243	167251	167127	167127	I	0	” I said , to soothe her , “
167314	167315	167316	167316	I	0	” “
167369	167393	167363	167363	I	0	” Waiting until she was quiet again,—for this , too , flashed out of her in a wild and sudden way,—I went on . “
167506	167507	167508	167508	They	3309	” “
167513	167518	167508	167508	They	3309	” said Miss Havisham . “
167525	167529	167531	167531	they	3309	” said I , “
167558	167597	167555	167555	I	0	” This contrasting of them with the rest seemed , I was glad to see , to do them good with her . She looked at me keenly for a little while , and then said quietly , — “
167605	167606	167600	167600	you	0	” “
167609	167613	167600	167600	you	0	” said I , “
167645	167657	167660	167660	you	0	” Still looking at me keenly , Miss Havisham repeated , — “
167665	167666	167660	167660	you	0	” “
167676	167690	167667	167667	I	0	” I said , in answer , conscious that I reddened a little , “
167751	167752	167745	167745	I	0	” “
167762	167782	167745	167745	I	0	” she asked , settling her hands upon her stick , that she might regard me the more attentively . “
167785	167789	167790	167790	I	0	” said I , “
167846	167951	167839	167840	another person	3317	” She gradually withdrew her eyes from me , and turned them on the fire . After watching it for what appeared in the silence and by the light of the slowly wasting candles to be a long time , she was roused by the collapse of some of the red coals , and looked towards me again — at first , vacantly — then , with a gradually concentrating attention . All this time Estella knitted on . When Miss Havisham had fixed her attention on me , she said , speaking as if there had been no lapse in our dialogue , — “
167955	167956	167957	167957	Estella	196	” “
167959	167976	167977	167977	you	196	” said I , turning to her now , and trying to command my trembling voice , “
167994	168042	167986	167986	I	0	” She raised her eyes to my face , on being thus addressed , and her fingers plied their work , and she looked at me with an unmoved countenance . I saw that Miss Havisham glanced from me to her , and from her to me . “
168096	168114	168090	168090	I	0	” Preserving her unmoved countenance , and with her fingers still going , Estella shook her head . “
168118	168126	168115	168115	I	0	” said I , in answer to that action,—“I
168186	168204	168172	168172	I	0	” Looking at me perfectly unmoved and with her fingers busy , she shook her head again . “
168281	168309	168275	168275	she	227	” I saw Miss Havisham put her hand to her heart and hold it there , as she sat looking by turns at Estella and at me . “
168313	168320	168275	168275	she	227	” said Estella , very calmly , “
168402	168410	168399	168399	I	0	” I said in a miserable manner , “
168413	168414	168399	168399	I	0	” “
168441	168442	168436	168436	you	196	” “
168472	168473	168436	168436	you	196	” “
168482	168498	168436	168436	you	196	” she returned . And then she added , with a stress upon the words , “
168531	168532	168525	168525	I	0	” “
168538	168542	168525	168525	I	0	” said I , “
168555	168556	168544	168545	Bentley Drummle	298	” “
168562	168576	168544	168545	Bentley Drummle	298	” she replied , referring to him with the indifference of utter contempt . “
168598	168614	168590	168590	he	3324	” She seemed a little surprised that I should know it , but again replied , “
168618	168619	168590	168590	he	3324	” “
168628	168643	168620	168620	You	196	” Her fingers stopped for the first time , as she retorted rather angrily , “
168669	168670	168666	168666	I	0	” “
168679	168702	168671	168671	You	196	” She looked towards Miss Havisham , and considered for a moment with her work in her hands . Then she said , “
168719	168785	168786	168786	Estella	196	” I dropped my face into my hands , but was able to control myself better than I could have expected , considering what agony it gave me to hear her say those words . When I raised my face again , there was such a ghastly look upon Miss Havisham ’s , that it impressed me , even in my passionate hurry and grief . “
168899	168933	168934	168934	I	0	” My earnestness awoke a wonder in her that seemed as if it would have been touched with compassion , if she could have rendered me at all intelligible to her own mind . “
168938	168948	168896	168896	your	196	” she said again , in a gentler voice , “
168989	168990	168991	168991	Your	0	” “
169005	169006	169002	169003	a brute	3333	” “
169015	169023	169025	169025	I	0	” she retorted , with a smile . “
169134	169135	169137	169139	a mean brute	3339	” “
169146	169153	169137	169139	a mean brute	3339	” I urged , in despair . “
169166	169170	169171	169171	I	0	” said Estella ; “
169197	169198	169190	169190	you	196	” “
169202	169224	169190	169190	you	196	” I answered , as my bitter tears fell fast on her hand , do what I would to restrain them ; “
169250	169251	169245	169245	you	196	” “
169254	169256	169245	169245	you	196	” she returned,—“nonsense
169265	169266	169269	169269	Estella	196	” “
169271	169272	169273	169273	You	196	” “
169285	169286	169273	169273	You	196	” “
169534	169908	169909	169909	I	0	” In what ecstasy of unhappiness I got these broken words out of myself , I do n’t know . The rhapsody welled up within me , like blood from an inward wound , and gushed out . I held her hand to my lips some lingering moments , and so I left her . But ever afterwards , I remembered,—and soon afterwards with stronger reason,—that while Estella looked at me merely with incredulous wonder , the spectral figure of Miss Havisham , her hand still covering her heart , seemed all resolved into a ghastly stare of pity and remorse . All done , all gone ! So much was done and gone , that when I went out at the gate , the light of the day seemed of a darker colour than when I went in . For a while , I hid myself among some lanes and by - paths , and then struck off to walk all the way to London . For , I had by that time come to myself so far as to consider that I could not go back to the inn and see Drummle there ; that I could not bear to sit upon the coach and be spoken to ; that I could do nothing half so good for myself as tire myself out . It was past midnight when I crossed London Bridge . Pursuing the narrow intricacies of the streets which at that time tended westward near the Middlesex shore of the river , my readiest access to the Temple was close by the river - side , through Whitefriars . I was not expected till to - morrow ; but I had my keys , and , if Herbert were gone to bed , could get to bed myself without disturbing him . As it seldom happened that I came in at that Whitefriars gate after the Temple was closed , and as I was very muddy and weary , I did not take it ill that the night - porter examined me with much attention as he held the gate a little way open for me to pass in . To help his memory I mentioned my name . “
169948	169983	169929	169933	The messenger that brought it	3355	” [ Illustration ] Much surprised by the request , I took the note . It was directed to Philip Pip , Esquire , and on the top of the superscription were the words , “
169990	170012	169929	169933	The messenger that brought it	3355	” I opened it , the watchman holding up his light , and read inside , in Wemmick ’s writing , — “
170017	171083	169929	169933	The messenger that brought it	3355	” Chapter XLV . Turning from the Temple gate as soon as I had read the warning , I made the best of my way to Fleet Street , and there got a late hackney chariot and drove to the Hummums in Covent Garden . In those times a bed was always to be got there at any hour of the night , and the chamberlain , letting me in at his ready wicket , lighted the candle next in order on his shelf , and showed me straight into the bedroom next in order on his list . It was a sort of vault on the ground floor at the back , with a despotic monster of a four - post bedstead in it , straddling over the whole place , putting one of his arbitrary legs into the fireplace and another into the doorway , and squeezing the wretched little washing - stand in quite a Divinely Righteous manner . As I had asked for a night - light , the chamberlain had brought me in , before he left me , the good old constitutional rushlight of those virtuous days — an object like the ghost of a walking - cane , which instantly broke its back if it were touched , which nothing could ever be lighted at , and which was placed in solitary confinement at the bottom of a high tin tower , perforated with round holes that made a staringly wide - awake pattern on the walls . When I had got into bed , and lay there footsore , weary , and wretched , I found that I could no more close my own eyes than I could close the eyes of this foolish Argus . And thus , in the gloom and death of the night , we stared at one another . What a doleful night ! How anxious , how dismal , how long ! There was an inhospitable smell in the room , of cold soot and hot dust ; and , as I looked up into the corners of the tester over my head , I thought what a number of blue - bottle flies from the butchers ’ , and earwigs from the market , and grubs from the country , must be holding on up there , lying by for next summer . This led me to speculate whether any of them ever tumbled down , and then I fancied that I felt light falls on my face,—a disagreeable turn of thought , suggesting other and more objectionable approaches up my back . When I had lain awake a little while , those extraordinary voices with which silence teems began to make themselves audible . The closet whispered , the fireplace sighed , the little washing - stand ticked , and one guitar - string played occasionally in the chest of drawers . At about the same time , the eyes on the wall acquired a new expression , and in every one of those staring rounds I saw written , DON’T GO HOME . Whatever night - fancies and night - noises crowded on me , they never warded off this DON’T GO HOME . It plaited itself into whatever I thought of , as a bodily pain would have done . Not long before , I had read in the newspapers , how a gentleman unknown had come to the Hummums in the night , and had gone to bed , and had destroyed himself , and had been found in the morning weltering in blood . It came into my head that he must have occupied this very vault of mine , and I got out of bed to assure myself that there were no red marks about ; then opened the door to look out into the passages , and cheer myself with the companionship of a distant light , near which I knew the chamberlain to be dozing . But all this time , why I was not to go home , and what had happened at home , and when I should go home , and whether Provis was safe at home , were questions occupying my mind so busily , that one might have supposed there could be no more room in it for any other theme . Even when I thought of Estella , and how we had parted that day forever , and when I recalled all the circumstances of our parting , and all her looks and tones , and the action of her fingers while she knitted,—even then I was pursuing , here and there and everywhere , the caution , Do n’t go home . When at last I dozed , in sheer exhaustion of mind and body , it became a vast shadowy verb which I had to conjugate . Imperative mood , present tense : Do not thou go home , let him not go home , let us not go home , do not ye or you go home , let not them go home . Then potentially : I may not and I can not go home ; and I might not , could not , would not , and should not go home ; until I felt that I was going distracted , and rolled over on the pillow , and looked at the staring rounds upon the wall again . I had left directions that I was to be called at seven ; for it was plain that I must see Wemmick before seeing any one else , and equally plain that this was a case in which his Walworth sentiments only could be taken . It was a relief to get out of the room where the night had been so miserable , and I needed no second knocking at the door to startle me from my uneasy bed . The Castle battlements arose upon my view at eight o’clock . The little servant happening to be entering the fortress with two hot rolls , I passed through the postern and crossed the drawbridge in her company , and so came without announcement into the presence of Wemmick as he was making tea for himself and the Aged . An open door afforded a perspective view of the Aged in bed . “
171089	171093	171086	171087	Mr. Pip	249	” said Wemmick . “
171101	171102	171094	171094	You	249	” “
171105	171109	171094	171094	You	249	” I returned ; “
171117	171118	171111	171111	I	0	” “
171124	171132	171133	171133	I	0	” said he , rubbing his hands . “
171157	171162	171163	171163	I	0	” I told him . “
171181	171185	171227	171227	you	249	” said Wemmick ; “
171237	171248	171227	171227	you	249	” I said I should be delighted to do it . “
171260	171268	171254	171254	your	249	” said Wemmick to the little servant ; “
171283	171329	171280	171281	Mr. Pip	249	” he added , winking , as she disappeared . I thanked him for his friendship and caution , and our discourse proceeded in a low tone , while I toasted the Aged ’s sausage and he buttered the crumb of the Aged ’s roll . “
171338	171342	171332	171333	Mr. Pip	249	” said Wemmick , “
171384	171416	171417	171417	I	0	” I cordially assented . I was so very nervous , that I had already lighted the Aged ’s sausage like a torch , and been obliged to blow it out . “
171424	171428	171417	171417	I	0	” said Wemmick , “
171455	171456	171417	171417	I	0	” “
171461	171464	171417	171417	I	0	” said I. “
171469	171470	171467	171467	you	0	” “
171480	171484	171471	171471	I	0	” said Wemmick , “
171515	171516	171512	171513	this person	3363	” “
171520	171523	171512	171513	this person	3363	” said I. “
171562	171595	171512	171513	this person	3363	” In watching his face , I made quite a firework of the Aged ’s sausage , and greatly discomposed both my own attention and Wemmick ’s ; for which I apologised . “
171614	171618	171627	171627	I	0	” said Wemmick , “
171651	171652	171627	171627	I	0	” “
171656	171659	171660	171660	I	0	” said I. “
171667	171673	171660	171660	I	0	” said Wemmick , evasively , “
171714	171808	171710	171710	I	0	” He took the toasting - fork and sausage from me as he spoke , and set forth the Aged ’s breakfast neatly on a little tray . Previous to placing it before him , he went into the Aged ’s room with a clean white cloth , and tied the same under the old gentleman ’s chin , and propped him up , and put his nightcap on one side , and gave him quite a rakish air . Then he placed his breakfast before him with great care , and said , “
171819	171827	171816	171817	Aged P.	3371	” To which the cheerful Aged replied , “
171839	171879	171831	171831	John	310	” As there seemed to be a tacit understanding that the Aged was not in a presentable state , and was therefore to be considered invisible , I made a pretence of being in complete ignorance of these proceedings . “
171898	171908	171831	171831	John	310	” I said to Wemmick when he came back , “
171923	171929	171930	171930	I	0	” Wemmick looked very serious . “
171976	172114	172115	172115	You	3375	” As I saw that he was restrained by fealty to Little Britain from saying as much as he could , and as I knew with thankfulness to him how far out of his way he went to say what he did , I could not press him . But I told him , after a little meditation over the fire , that I would like to ask him a question , subject to his answering or not answering , as he deemed right , and sure that his course would be right . He paused in his breakfast , and crossing his arms , and pinching his shirt - sleeves ( his notion of in - door comfort was to sit without any coat ) , he nodded to me once , to put my question . “
172131	172139	172141	172141	he	3376	” He answered with one other nod . “
172144	172149	172151	172151	he	3376	” One other nod . “
172155	172183	172151	172151	he	3376	” He gave me one other nod , compressed the post - office exceedingly , gave me one last nod , and went on with his breakfast . “
172186	172190	172151	172151	he	3376	” said Wemmick , “
172195	172205	172151	172151	he	3376	” which he emphasised and repeated for my guidance , “
172242	172243	172245	172245	him	3376	” “
172249	172257	172246	172246	you	0	” said I , with great anxiety . “
172326	172327	172328	172328	He	3376	” “
172337	172338	172339	172339	He	3376	” “
172436	172453	172454	172455	Mr. Herbert	282	” I thanked him for his valuable advice , and asked him what Herbert had done ? “
172457	172461	172454	172455	Mr. Herbert	282	” said Wemmick , “
172551	172552	172544	172546	the young lady	5760	” “
172556	172733	172544	172546	the young lady	5760	” said I. The truth was , that she had objected to me as an expensive companion who did Herbert no good , and that , when Herbert had first proposed to present me to her , she had received the proposal with such very moderate warmth , that Herbert had felt himself obliged to confide the state of the case to me , with a view to the lapse of a little time before I made her acquaintance . When I had begun to advance Herbert ’s prospects by stealth , I had been able to bear this with cheerful philosophy : he and his affianced , for their part , had naturally not been very anxious to introduce a third person into their interviews ; and thus , although I was assured that I had risen in Clara ’s esteem , and although the young lady and I had long regularly interchanged messages and remembrances by Herbert , I had never seen her . However , I did not trouble Wemmick with these particulars . “
172742	172746	172544	172546	the young lady	5760	” said Wemmick , “
172927	172947	172922	172922	he	3392	” Much comforted by these considerations , I thanked Wemmick again and again , and begged him to proceed . “
173108	173130	173104	173104	you	3396	” Wemmick , having finished his breakfast , here looked at his watch , and began to get his coat on . “
173137	173149	173134	173135	Mr. Pip	249	” said he , with his hands still in the sleeves , “
173262	173279	173282	173282	me	0	” ; his hands were now out of his sleeves , and I was shaking them ; “
173291	173307	173309	173309	yourself	3396	” He laid his hands upon my shoulders , and added in a solemn whisper : “
173341	173360	173321	173321	You	3396	” Quite despairing of making my mind clear to Wemmick on this point , I forbore to try . “
173365	173369	173371	173371	I	0	” said Wemmick , “
173432	173433	173427	173427	you	3396	” “
173437	173440	173427	173427	you	3396	” said I. “
173490	173496	173487	173488	Aged Parent	2246	” in a cheery shout . “
173508	174158	173487	173488	Aged Parent	2246	” piped the old man from within . I soon fell asleep before Wemmick ’s fire , and the Aged and I enjoyed one another ’s society by falling asleep before it more or less all day . We had loin of pork for dinner , and greens grown on the estate ; and I nodded at the Aged with a good intention whenever I failed to do it drowsily . When it was quite dark , I left the Aged preparing the fire for toast ; and I inferred from the number of teacups , as well as from his glances at the two little doors in the wall , that Miss Skiffins was expected . Chapter XLVI . Eight o’clock had struck before I got into the air , that was scented , not disagreeably , by the chips and shavings of the long - shore boat - builders , and mast , oar , and block makers . All that water - side region of the upper and lower Pool below Bridge was unknown ground to me ; and when I struck down by the river , I found that the spot I wanted was not where I had supposed it to be , and was anything but easy to find . It was called Mill Pond Bank , Chinks ’s Basin ; and I had no other guide to Chinks ’s Basin than the Old Green Copper Rope - walk . It matters not what stranded ships repairing in dry docks I lost myself among , what old hulls of ships in course of being knocked to pieces , what ooze and slime and other dregs of tide , what yards of ship - builders and ship - breakers , what rusty anchors blindly biting into the ground , though for years off duty , what mountainous country of accumulated casks and timber , how many rope - walks that were not the Old Green Copper . After several times falling short of my destination and as often overshooting it , I came unexpectedly round a corner , upon Mill Pond Bank . It was a fresh kind of place , all circumstances considered , where the wind from the river had room to turn itself round ; and there were two or three trees in it , and there was the stump of a ruined windmill , and there was the Old Green Copper Rope - walk,—whose long and narrow vista I could trace in the moonlight , along a series of wooden frames set in the ground , that looked like superannuated haymaking - rakes which had grown old and lost most of their teeth . Selecting from the few queer houses upon Mill Pond Bank a house with a wooden front and three stories of bow - window ( not bay - window , which is another thing ) , I looked at the plate upon the door , and read there , Mrs. Whimple . That being the name I wanted , I knocked , and an elderly woman of a pleasant and thriving appearance responded . She was immediately deposed , however , by Herbert , who silently led me into the parlour and shut the door . It was an odd sensation to see his very familiar face established quite at home in that very unfamiliar room and region ; and I found myself looking at him , much as I looked at the corner - cupboard with the glass and china , the shells upon the chimney - piece , and the coloured engravings on the wall , representing the death of Captain Cook , a ship - launch , and his Majesty King George the Third in a state coachman ’s wig , leather - breeches , and top - boots , on the terrace at Windsor . “
174165	174169	174171	174171	he	3409	” said Herbert , “
174222	174243	174247	174247	he	3409	” I had become aware of an alarming growling overhead , and had probably expressed the fact in my countenance . “
174254	174260	174247	174247	he	3409	” said Herbert , smiling , “
174280	174281	174274	174274	He	3409	” “
174285	174288	174274	174274	He	3409	” said I. “
174291	174295	174274	174274	He	3409	” returned Herbert , “
174354	174373	174349	174350	a chandler	3419	” While he thus spoke , the growling noise became a prolonged roar , and then died away . “
174381	174388	174390	174390	he	3409	” said Herbert , in explanation , “
174424	174441	174454	174455	Mrs. Whimple	392	” He seemed to have hurt himself very much , for he gave another furious roar . “
174457	174461	174454	174455	Mrs. Whimple	392	” said Herbert , “
174484	174500	174501	174502	Mrs. Whimple	392	” It was a curious place , indeed ; but remarkably well kept and clean . “
174504	174514	174501	174502	Mrs. Whimple	392	” said Herbert , when I told him so , “
174559	174560	174556	174557	old Gruffandgrim	394	” “
174570	174571	174568	174568	Herbert	282	” “
174576	174580	174568	174568	Herbert	282	” said Herbert , “
174630	174814	174815	174815	Clara	331	” Herbert had told me on former occasions , and now reminded me , that he first knew Miss Clara Barley when she was completing her education at an establishment at Hammersmith , and that on her being recalled home to nurse her father , he and she had confided their affection to the motherly Mrs. Whimple , by whom it had been fostered and regulated with equal kindness and discretion , ever since . It was understood that nothing of a tender nature could possibly be confided to old Barley , by reason of his being totally unequal to the consideration of any subject more psychological than Gout , Rum , and Purser ’s stores . As we were thus conversing in a low tone while Old Barley ’s sustained growl vibrated in the beam that crossed the ceiling , the room door opened , and a very pretty , slight , dark - eyed girl of twenty or so came in with a basket in her hand : whom Herbert tenderly relieved of the basket , and presented , blushing , as “
174817	174849	174815	174815	Clara	331	” She really was a most charming girl , and might have passed for a captive fairy , whom that truculent Ogre , Old Barley , had pressed into his service . “
174853	174876	174815	174815	Clara	331	” said Herbert , showing me the basket , with a compassionate and tender smile , after we had talked a little ; “
174985	175153	175154	175154	Papa	398	” There was something so natural and winning in Clara ’s resigned way of looking at these stores in detail , as Herbert pointed them out ; and something so confiding , loving , and innocent in her modest manner of yielding herself to Herbert ’s embracing arm ; and something so gentle in her , so much needing protection on Mill Pond Bank , by Chinks ’s Basin , and the Old Green Copper Rope - walk , with Old Barley growling in the beam,—that I would not have undone the engagement between her and Herbert for all the money in the pocket - book I had never opened . I was looking at her with pleasure and admiration , when suddenly the growl swelled into a roar again , and a frightful bumping noise was heard above , as if a giant with a wooden leg were trying to bore it through the ceiling to come at us . Upon this Clara said to Herbert , “
175160	175165	175154	175154	Papa	398	” and ran away . “
175175	175179	175154	175154	Papa	398	” said Herbert . “
175190	175191	175188	175188	Handel	284	” “
175197	175200	175188	175188	Handel	284	” said I. “
175205	175206	175188	175188	Handel	284	” “
175211	175226	175227	175227	He	398	” cried Herbert , as if I had made a guess of extraordinary merit . “
175261	175273	175258	175258	he	398	” Another roar , with a prolonged shake at the end . “
175276	175287	175288	175288	he	398	” said Herbert , as it was succeeded by silence , “
175294	175308	175309	175309	he	398	” said Herbert , as the growl resounded in the beam once more , “
175317	175375	175309	175309	he	398	” Clara returned soon afterwards , and Herbert accompanied me upstairs to see our charge . As we passed Mr. Barley ’s door , he was heard hoarsely muttering within , in a strain that rose and fell like wind , the following Refrain , in which I substitute good wishes for something quite the reverse : — “
175444	175664	175442	175442	you	0	” In this strain of consolation , Herbert informed me the invisible Barley would commune with himself by the day and night together ; Often , while it was light , having , at the same time , one eye at a telescope which was fitted on his bed for the convenience of sweeping the river . In his two cabin rooms at the top of the house , which were fresh and airy , and in which Mr. Barley was less audible than below , I found Provis comfortably settled . He expressed no alarm , and seemed to feel none that was worth mentioning ; but it struck me that he was softened,—indefinably , for I could not have said how , and could never afterwards recall how when I tried , but certainly . The opportunity that the day ’s rest had given me for reflection had resulted in my fully determining to say nothing to him respecting Compeyson . For anything I knew , his animosity towards the man might otherwise lead to his seeking him out and rushing on his own destruction . Therefore , when Herbert and I sat down with him by his fire , I asked him first of all whether he relied on Wemmick ’s judgment and sources of information ? “
175672	175681	175682	175682	Jaggers	245	” he answered , with a grave nod , “
175685	175686	175682	175682	Jaggers	245	” “
175695	175699	175689	175689	I	0	” said I , “
175715	176010	175708	175708	he	269	” This I did accurately , with the reservation just mentioned ; and I told him how Wemmick had heard , in Newgate prison ( whether from officers or prisoners I could not say ) , that he was under some suspicion , and that my chambers had been watched ; how Wemmick had recommended his keeping close for a time , and my keeping away from him ; and what Wemmick had said about getting him abroad . I added , that of course , when the time came , I should go with him , or should follow close upon him , as might be safest in Wemmick ’s judgment . What was to follow that I did not touch upon ; neither , indeed , was I at all clear or comfortable about it in my own mind , now that I saw him in that softer condition , and in declared peril for my sake . As to altering my way of living by enlarging my expenses , I put it to him whether in our present unsettled and difficult circumstances , it would not be simply ridiculous , if it were no worse ? He could not deny this , and indeed was very reasonable throughout . His coming back was a venture , he said , and he had always known it to be a venture . He would do nothing to make it a desperate venture , and he had very little fear of his safety with such good help . Herbert , who had been looking at the fire and pondering , here said that something had come into his thoughts arising out of Wemmick ’s suggestion , which it might be worth while to pursue . “
176144	176262	176263	176263	I	0	” I liked this scheme , and Provis was quite elated by it . We agreed that it should be carried into execution , and that Provis should never recognise us if we came below Bridge , and rowed past Mill Pond Bank . But we further agreed that he should pull down the blind in that part of his window which gave upon the east , whenever he saw us and all was right . Our conference being now ended , and everything arranged , I rose to go ; remarking to Herbert that he and I had better not go home together , and that I would take half an hour ’s start of him . “
176272	176278	176263	176263	I	0	” I said to Provis , “
176296	176297	176298	176299	Dear boy	3010	” “
176301	176309	176298	176299	Dear boy	3010	” he answered , clasping my hands , “
176334	176335	176340	176340	Herbert	282	” “
176369	178301	176340	176340	Herbert	282	” We thought it best that he should stay in his own rooms ; and we left him on the landing outside his door , holding a light over the stair - rail to light us downstairs . Looking back at him , I thought of the first night of his return , when our positions were reversed , and when I little supposed my heart could ever be as heavy and anxious at parting from him as it was now . Old Barley was growling and swearing when we repassed his door , with no appearance of having ceased or of meaning to cease . When we got to the foot of the stairs , I asked Herbert whether he had preserved the name of Provis . He replied , certainly not , and that the lodger was Mr. Campbell . He also explained that the utmost known of Mr. Campbell there was , that he ( Herbert ) had Mr. Campbell consigned to him , and felt a strong personal interest in his being well cared for , and living a secluded life . So , when we went into the parlour where Mrs. Whimple and Clara were seated at work , I said nothing of my own interest in Mr. Campbell , but kept it to myself . When I had taken leave of the pretty , gentle , dark - eyed girl , and of the motherly woman who had not outlived her honest sympathy with a little affair of true love , I felt as if the Old Green Copper Rope - walk had grown quite a different place . Old Barley might be as old as the hills , and might swear like a whole field of troopers , but there were redeeming youth and trust and hope enough in Chinks ’s Basin to fill it to overflowing . And then I thought of Estella , and of our parting , and went home very sadly . All things were as quiet in the Temple as ever I had seen them . The windows of the rooms on that side , lately occupied by Provis , were dark and still , and there was no lounger in Garden Court . I walked past the fountain twice or thrice before I descended the steps that were between me and my rooms , but I was quite alone . Herbert , coming to my bedside when he came in,—for I went straight to bed , dispirited and fatigued,—made the same report . Opening one of the windows after that , he looked out into the moonlight , and told me that the pavement was as solemnly empty as the pavement of any cathedral at that same hour . Next day I set myself to get the boat . It was soon done , and the boat was brought round to the Temple stairs , and lay where I could reach her within a minute or two . Then , I began to go out as for training and practice : sometimes alone , sometimes with Herbert . I was often out in cold , rain , and sleet , but nobody took much note of me after I had been out a few times . At first , I kept above Blackfriars Bridge ; but as the hours of the tide changed , I took towards London Bridge . It was Old London Bridge in those days , and at certain states of the tide there was a race and fall of water there which gave it a bad reputation . But I knew well enough how to ‘ shoot ’ the bridge after seeing it done , and so began to row about among the shipping in the Pool , and down to Erith . The first time I passed Mill Pond Bank , Herbert and I were pulling a pair of oars ; and , both in going and returning , we saw the blind towards the east come down . Herbert was rarely there less frequently than three times in a week , and he never brought me a single word of intelligence that was at all alarming . Still , I knew that there was cause for alarm , and I could not get rid of the notion of being watched . Once received , it is a haunting idea ; how many undesigning persons I suspected of watching me , it would be hard to calculate . In short , I was always full of fears for the rash man who was in hiding . Herbert had sometimes said to me that he found it pleasant to stand at one of our windows after dark , when the tide was running down , and to think that it was flowing , with everything it bore , towards Clara . But I thought with dread that it was flowing towards Magwitch , and that any black mark on its surface might be his pursuers , going swiftly , silently , and surely , to take him . Chapter XLVII . Some weeks passed without bringing any change . We waited for Wemmick , and he made no sign . If I had never known him out of Little Britain , and had never enjoyed the privilege of being on a familiar footing at the Castle , I might have doubted him ; not so for a moment , knowing him as I did . My worldly affairs began to wear a gloomy appearance , and I was pressed for money by more than one creditor . Even I myself began to know the want of money ( I mean of ready money in my own pocket ) , and to relieve it by converting some easily spared articles of jewelery into cash . But I had quite determined that it would be a heartless fraud to take more money from my patron in the existing state of my uncertain thoughts and plans . Therefore , I had sent him the unopened pocket - book by Herbert , to hold in his own keeping , and I felt a kind of satisfaction — whether it was a false kind or a true , I hardly know — in not having profited by his generosity since his revelation of himself . As the time wore on , an impression settled heavily upon me that Estella was married . Fearful of having it confirmed , though it was all but a conviction , I avoided the newspapers , and begged Herbert ( to whom I had confided the circumstances of our last interview ) never to speak of her to me . Why I hoarded up this last wretched little rag of the robe of hope that was rent and given to the winds , how do I know ? Why did you who read this , commit that not dissimilar inconsistency of your own last year , last month , last week ? It was an unhappy life that I lived ; and its one dominant anxiety , towering over all its other anxieties , like a high mountain above a range of mountains , never disappeared from my view . Still , no new cause for fear arose . Let me start from my bed as I would , with the terror fresh upon me that he was discovered ; let me sit listening , as I would with dread , for Herbert ’s returning step at night , lest it should be fleeter than ordinary , and winged with evil news,—for all that , and much more to like purpose , the round of things went on . Condemned to inaction and a state of constant restlessness and suspense , I rowed about in my boat , and waited , waited , waited , as I best could . There were states of the tide when , having been down the river , I could not get back through the eddy - chafed arches and starlings of old London Bridge ; then , I left my boat at a wharf near the Custom House , to be brought up afterwards to the Temple stairs . I was not averse to doing this , as it served to make me and my boat a commoner incident among the water - side people there . From this slight occasion sprang two meetings that I have now to tell of . One afternoon , late in the month of February , I came ashore at the wharf at dusk . I had pulled down as far as Greenwich with the ebb tide , and had turned with the tide . It had been a fine bright day , but had become foggy as the sun dropped , and I had had to feel my way back among the shipping , pretty carefully . Both in going and returning , I had seen the signal in his window , All well . As it was a raw evening , and I was cold , I thought I would comfort myself with dinner at once ; and as I had hours of dejection and solitude before me if I went home to the Temple , I thought I would afterwards go to the play . The theatre where Mr. Wopsle had achieved his questionable triumph was in that water - side neighbourhood ( it is nowhere now ) , and to that theatre I resolved to go . I was aware that Mr. Wopsle had not succeeded in reviving the Drama , but , on the contrary , had rather partaken of its decline . He had been ominously heard of , through the play - bills , as a faithful Black , in connection with a little girl of noble birth , and a monkey . And Herbert had seen him as a predatory Tartar of comic propensities , with a face like a red brick , and an outrageous hat all over bells . I dined at what Herbert and I used to call a geographical chop - house , where there were maps of the world in porter - pot rims on every half - yard of the tablecloths , and charts of gravy on every one of the knives,—to this day there is scarcely a single chop - house within the Lord Mayor ’s dominions which is not geographical,—and wore out the time in dozing over crumbs , staring at gas , and baking in a hot blast of dinners . By and by , I roused myself , and went to the play . There , I found a virtuous boatswain in His Majesty ’s service,—a most excellent man , though I could have wished his trousers not quite so tight in some places , and not quite so loose in others,—who knocked all the little men ’s hats over their eyes , though he was very generous and brave , and who would n’t hear of anybody ’s paying taxes , though he was very patriotic . He had a bag of money in his pocket , like a pudding in the cloth , and on that property married a young person in bed - furniture , with great rejoicings ; the whole population of Portsmouth ( nine in number at the last census ) turning out on the beach to rub their own hands and shake everybody else ’s , and sing “
178306	178950	178953	178953	you	3453	” A certain dark - complexioned Swab , however , who would n’t fill , or do anything else that was proposed to him , and whose heart was openly stated ( by the boatswain ) to be as black as his figure - head , proposed to two other Swabs to get all mankind into difficulties ; which was so effectually done ( the Swab family having considerable political influence ) that it took half the evening to set things right , and then it was only brought about through an honest little grocer with a white hat , black gaiters , and red nose , getting into a clock , with a gridiron , and listening , and coming out , and knocking everybody down from behind with the gridiron whom he could n’t confute with what he had overheard . This led to Mr. Wopsle ’s ( who had never been heard of before ) coming in with a star and garter on , as a plenipotentiary of great power direct from the Admiralty , to say that the Swabs were all to go to prison on the spot , and that he had brought the boatswain down the Union Jack , as a slight acknowledgment of his public services . The boatswain , unmanned for the first time , respectfully dried his eyes on the Jack , and then cheering up , and addressing Mr. Wopsle as Your Honour , solicited permission to take him by the fin . Mr. Wopsle , conceding his fin with a gracious dignity , was immediately shoved into a dusty corner , while everybody danced a hornpipe ; and from that corner , surveying the public with a discontented eye , became aware of me . The second piece was the last new grand comic Christmas pantomime , in the first scene of which , it pained me to suspect that I detected Mr. Wopsle with red worsted legs under a highly magnified phosphoric countenance and a shock of red curtain - fringe for his hair , engaged in the manufacture of thunderbolts in a mine , and displaying great cowardice when his gigantic master came home ( very hoarse ) to dinner . But he presently presented himself under worthier circumstances ; for , the Genius of Youthful Love being in want of assistance,—on account of the parental brutality of an ignorant farmer who opposed the choice of his daughter ’s heart , by purposely falling upon the object , in a flour - sack , out of the first - floor window,—summoned a sententious Enchanter ; and he , coming up from the antipodes rather unsteadily , after an apparently violent journey , proved to be Mr. Wopsle in a high - crowned hat , with a necromantic work in one volume under his arm . The business of this enchanter on earth being principally to be talked at , sung at , butted at , danced at , and flashed at with fires of various colours , he had a good deal of time on his hands . And I observed , with great surprise , that he devoted it to staring in my direction as if he were lost in amazement . There was something so remarkable in the increasing glare of Mr. Wopsle ’s eye , and he seemed to be turning so many things over in his mind and to grow so confused , that I could not make it out . I sat thinking of it long after he had ascended to the clouds in a large watch - case , and still I could not make it out . I was still thinking of it when I came out of the theatre an hour afterwards , and found him waiting for me near the door . “
178956	178972	178953	178953	you	3453	” said I , shaking hands with him as we turned down the street together . “
178980	178981	178976	178976	you	3453	” “
178988	178992	178985	178986	Mr. Pip	249	” he returned . “
179007	179008	178997	178997	I	0	” “
179012	179013	178997	178997	I	0	” “
179020	179032	179039	179039	him	3453	” said Mr. Wopsle , drifting into his lost look again ; “
179041	179054	179039	179039	him	3453	” Becoming alarmed , I entreated Mr. Wopsle to explain his meaning . “
179069	179082	179065	179065	your	3453	” said Mr. Wopsle , going on in the same lost way , “
179095	179124	179092	179092	I	0	” Involuntarily I looked round me , as I was accustomed to look round me when I went home ; for these mysterious words gave me a chill . “
179134	179139	179140	179140	He	3453	” said Mr. Wopsle . “
179153	179197	179148	179148	I	0	” Having the reason that I had for being suspicious , I even suspected this poor actor . I mistrusted a design to entrap me into some admission . Therefore I glanced at him as we walked on together , but said nothing . “
179232	179290	179217	179217	you	0	” My former chill crept over me again , but I was resolved not to speak yet , for it was quite consistent with his words that he might be set on to induce me to connect these references with Provis . Of course , I was perfectly sure and safe that Provis had not been there . “
179340	179341	179336	179336	you	0	” “
179344	179347	179352	179353	Mr. Pip	249	” said I. “
179394	179395	179380	179381	some soldiers	3455	” “
179402	179403	179380	179381	some soldiers	3455	” “
179451	179452	179440	179440	you	0	” “
179460	179469	179440	179440	you	0	” Better than he thought,—except the last clause . “
179512	179513	179514	179514	I	0	” “
179521	179522	179514	179514	I	0	” “
179586	179587	179618	179618	him	3462	” “
179590	179593	179618	179618	him	3462	” said I. “
179599	179600	179594	179594	I	0	” “
179623	179624	179618	179618	him	3462	” “
179627	179636	179618	179618	him	3462	” I thought . I asked him then , “
179647	179648	179644	179644	you	249	” “
179656	179661	179649	179654	The one who had been mauled	3464	” he answered readily , “
179685	179686	179680	179680	I	0	” “
179692	179712	179680	179680	I	0	” said I , with the best assumption I could put on of its being nothing more to me . “
179717	179747	179680	179680	I	0	” I can not exaggerate the enhanced disquiet into which this conversation threw me , or the special and peculiar terror I felt at Compeyson ’s having been behind me “
179752	180354	179680	179680	I	0	” For if he had ever been out of my thoughts for a few moments together since the hiding had begun , it was in those very moments when he was closest to me ; and to think that I should be so unconscious and off my guard after all my care was as if I had shut an avenue of a hundred doors to keep him out , and then had found him at my elbow . I could not doubt , either , that he was there , because I was there , and that , however slight an appearance of danger there might be about us , danger was always near and active . I put such questions to Mr. Wopsle as , When did the man come in ? He could not tell me that ; he saw me , and over my shoulder he saw the man . It was not until he had seen him for some time that he began to identify him ; but he had from the first vaguely associated him with me , and known him as somehow belonging to me in the old village time . How was he dressed ? Prosperously , but not noticeably otherwise ; he thought , in black . Was his face at all disfigured ? No , he believed not . I believed not too , for , although in my brooding state I had taken no especial notice of the people behind me , I thought it likely that a face at all disfigured would have attracted my attention . When Mr. Wopsle had imparted to me all that he could recall or I extract , and when I had treated him to a little appropriate refreshment , after the fatigues of the evening , we parted . It was between twelve and one o’clock when I reached the Temple , and the gates were shut . No one was near me when I went in and went home . Herbert had come in , and we held a very serious council by the fire . But there was nothing to be done , saving to communicate to Wemmick what I had that night found out , and to remind him that we waited for his hint . As I thought that I might compromise him if I went too often to the Castle , I made this communication by letter . I wrote it before I went to bed , and went out and posted it ; and again no one was near me . Herbert and I agreed that we could do nothing else but be very cautious . And we were very cautious indeed,—more cautious than before , if that were possible,—and I for my part never went near Chinks ’s Basin , except when I rowed by , and then I only looked at Mill Pond Bank as I looked at anything else . Chapter XLVIII . The second of the two meetings referred to in the last chapter occurred about a week after the first . I had again left my boat at the wharf below Bridge ; the time was an hour earlier in the afternoon ; and , undecided where to dine , I had strolled up into Cheapside , and was strolling along it , surely the most unsettled person in all the busy concourse , when a large hand was laid upon my shoulder by some one overtaking me . It was Mr. Jaggers ’s hand , and he passed it through my arm . “
180377	180378	180383	180383	I	0	” “
180386	180389	180383	180383	I	0	” said I. “
180395	180400	180392	180392	you	249	” said Mr. Jaggers . “
180403	180421	180392	180392	you	249	” I returned , glad for once to get the better of him in cross - examination , “
180438	180439	180440	180440	You	249	” “
180446	180451	180452	180452	You	249	” said Mr. Jaggers . “
180462	180463	180452	180452	You	249	” “
180466	180470	180471	180471	I	0	” I returned , “
180478	180479	180471	180471	I	0	” “
180485	180486	180487	180487	I	0	” “
180499	180500	180487	180487	I	0	” “
180503	180508	180487	180487	I	0	” said Mr. Jaggers , “
180515	180527	180487	180487	I	0	” I was going to excuse myself , when he added , “
180532	180870	180487	180487	I	0	” So I changed my excuse into an acceptance,—the few words I had uttered , serving for the beginning of either,—and we went along Cheapside and slanted off to Little Britain , while the lights were springing up brilliantly in the shop windows , and the street lamp - lighters , scarcely finding ground enough to plant their ladders on in the midst of the afternoon ’s bustle , were skipping up and down and running in and out , opening more red eyes in the gathering fog than my rushlight tower at the Hummums had opened white eyes in the ghostly wall . At the office in Little Britain there was the usual letter - writing , hand - washing , candle - snuffing , and safe - locking , that closed the business of the day . As I stood idle by Mr. Jaggers ’s fire , its rising and falling flame made the two casts on the shelf look as if they were playing a diabolical game at bo - peep with me ; while the pair of coarse , fat office candles that dimly lighted Mr. Jaggers as he wrote in a corner were decorated with dirty winding - sheets , as if in remembrance of a host of hanged clients . We went to Gerrard Street , all three together , in a hackney - coach : And , as soon as we got there , dinner was served . Although I should not have thought of making , in that place , the most distant reference by so much as a look to Wemmick ’s Walworth sentiments , yet I should have had no objection to catching his eye now and then in a friendly way . But it was not to be done . He turned his eyes on Mr. Jaggers whenever he raised them from the table , and was as dry and distant to me as if there were twin Wemmicks , and this was the wrong one . “
180886	180897	180872	180872	you	3467	” Mr. Jaggers asked , soon after we began dinner . “
180902	180906	180872	180872	you	3467	” returned Wemmick ; “
180926	180938	180947	180947	Pip	249	” He handed it to his principal instead of to me . “
180949	180958	180947	180947	Pip	249	” said Mr. Jaggers , handing it on , “
181002	181003	180981	180981	she	227	” “
181006	181024	180981	180981	she	227	” said I , casting my eyes over the note , which was exactly in those terms . “
181033	181034	181035	181035	I	0	” “
181041	181059	181035	181035	I	0	” said I , glancing at Wemmick , who was putting fish into the post - office , “
181075	181076	181072	181072	I	0	” “
181088	181095	181096	181096	he	249	” said Wemmick to Mr. Jaggers , “
181106	181157	181096	181096	he	249	” Receiving this as an intimation that it was best not to delay , I settled that I would go to - morrow , and said so . Wemmick drank a glass of wine , and looked with a grimly satisfied air at Mr. Jaggers , but not at me . “
181167	181172	181175	181175	his	312	” said Mr. Jaggers , “
181184	181196	181178	181178	He	312	” It was as much as I could do to assent . “
181248	181249	181239	181239	he	312	” “
181252	181263	181264	181264	you	3474	” I interrupted , with a burning face and heart , “
181280	181281	181277	181278	Mr. Jaggers	245	” “
181362	181363	181365	181365	I	0	” “
181371	181372	181365	181365	I	0	” “
181381	181386	181365	181365	I	0	” answered Mr. Jaggers , “
181418	181419	181414	181414	his	269	” “
181425	181437	181414	181414	his	269	” said Wemmick , not at all addressing himself to me . “
181446	181473	181442	181444	Mrs. Bentley Drummle	298	” said Mr. Jaggers , taking a decanter of choicer wine from his dumb - waiter , and filling for each of us and for himself , “
181523	181578	181513	181513	Molly	315	” She was at his elbow when he addressed her , putting a dish upon the table . As she withdrew her hands from it , she fell back a step or two , nervously muttering some excuse . And a certain action of her fingers , as she spoke , arrested my attention . “
181584	181589	181513	181513	Molly	315	” said Mr. Jaggers . “
181600	181604	181509	181509	Molly	315	” said I , “
181611	182256	181509	181509	Molly	315	” The action of her fingers was like the action of knitting . She stood looking at her master , not understanding whether she was free to go , or whether he had more to say to her and would call her back if she did go . Her look was very intent . Surely , I had seen exactly such eyes and such hands on a memorable occasion very lately ! He dismissed her , and she glided out of the room . But she remained before me as plainly as if she were still there . I looked at those hands , I looked at those eyes , I looked at that flowing hair ; and I compared them with other hands , other eyes , other hair , that I knew of , and with what those might be after twenty years of a brutal husband and a stormy life . I looked again at those hands and eyes of the housekeeper , and thought of the inexplicable feeling that had come over me when I last walked — not alone — in the ruined garden , and through the deserted brewery . I thought how the same feeling had come back when I saw a face looking at me , and a hand waving to me from a stage - coach window ; and how it had come back again and had flashed about me like lightning , when I had passed in a carriage — not alone — through a sudden glare of light in a dark street . I thought how one link of association had helped that identification in the theatre , and how such a link , wanting before , had been riveted for me now , when I had passed by a chance swift from Estella ’s name to the fingers with their knitting action , and the attentive eyes . And I felt absolutely certain that this woman was Estella ’s mother . Mr. Jaggers had seen me with Estella , and was not likely to have missed the sentiments I had been at no pains to conceal . He nodded when I said the subject was painful to me , clapped me on the back , put round the wine again , and went on with his dinner . Only twice more did the housekeeper reappear , and then her stay in the room was very short , and Mr. Jaggers was sharp with her . But her hands were Estella ’s hands , and her eyes were Estella ’s eyes , and if she had reappeared a hundred times I could have been neither more sure nor less sure that my conviction was the truth . It was a dull evening , for Wemmick drew his wine , when it came round , quite as a matter of business,—just as he might have drawn his salary when that came round,—and with his eyes on his chief , sat in a state of perpetual readiness for cross - examination . As to the quantity of wine , his post - office was as indifferent and ready as any other post - office for its quantity of letters . From my point of view , he was the wrong twin all the time , and only externally like the Wemmick of Walworth . We took our leave early , and left together . Even when we were groping among Mr. Jaggers ’s stock of boots for our hats , I felt that the right twin was on his way back ; and we had not gone half a dozen yards down Gerrard Street in the Walworth direction , before I found that I was walking arm in arm with the right twin , and that the wrong twin had evaporated into the evening air . “
182259	182263	181509	181509	Molly	315	” said Wemmick , “
182300	182318	182294	182294	I	0	” I felt that this was a good statement of the case , and told him so . “
182328	182332	182326	182326	yourself	3487	” he answered . “
182347	182424	182326	182326	yourself	3487	” I asked him if he had ever seen Miss Havisham ’s adopted daughter , Mrs. Bentley Drummle . He said no . To avoid being too abrupt , I then spoke of the Aged and of Miss Skiffins . He looked rather sly when I mentioned Miss Skiffins , and stopped in the street to blow his nose , with a roll of the head , and a flourish not quite free from latent boastfulness . “
182427	182431	182433	182433	you	3487	” said I , “
182454	182455	182457	182457	I	0	” “
182459	182463	182457	182457	I	0	” he replied . “
182476	182482	182472	182472	Deuce	402	” he added , suddenly , “

182533	182534	182526	182527	Mr. Jaggers	245	” “

182590	182594	182572	182572	You	0	” Wemmick replied , “

182638	182639	182621	182621	We	3490	” “

182704	182705	182706	182707	Mr. Jaggers	245	” “
182712	182723	182706	182707	Mr. Jaggers	245	” pursued Wemmick , with a look full of meaning , “
182994	183004	182989	182989	You	3507	” said Wemmick , touching me on the sleeve , “
183023	183042	183018	183018	he	245	” I had told Wemmick of his showing us her wrists , that day of the dinner party . “
183047	183052	183060	183060	you	4442	” Wemmick went on ; “
183302	183444	183294	183295	Mr. Jaggers	245	“ We say these are not marks of finger - nails , but marks of brambles , and we show you the brambles . You say they are marks of finger - nails , and you set up the hypothesis that she destroyed her child . You must accept all consequences of that hypothesis . For anything we know , she may have destroyed her child , and the child in clinging to her may have scratched her hands . What then ? You are not trying her for the murder of her child ; why do n’t you ? As to this case , if you _ will _ have scratches , we say that , for anything we know , you may have accounted for them , assuming for the sake of argument that you have not invented them ? ”
183445	183452	183454	183454	Wemmick	269	“ To sum up , sir , ”
183456	183472	183454	183454	Wemmick	269	“ Mr. Jaggers was altogether too many for the jury , and they gave in . ”
183473	183483	183294	183295	Mr. Jaggers	245	“ Has she been in his service ever since ? ”
183484	183492	183494	183494	Wemmick	269	“ Yes ; but not only that , ”
183496	183537	183494	183494	Wemmick	269	“ she went into his service immediately after her acquittal , tamed as she is now . She has since been taught one thing and another in the way of her duties , but she was tamed from the beginning . ”
183538	183548	183294	183295	Mr. Jaggers	245	“ Do you remember the sex of the child ? ”
183549	183557	183494	183494	Wemmick	269	“ Said to have been a girl . ”
183558	183571	183494	183494	Wemmick	269	“ You have nothing more to say to me to - night ? ”
183572	183585	183294	183295	Mr. Jaggers	245	“ Nothing . I got your letter and destroyed it . Nothing . ”
184089	184094	184079	184079	She	227	“ Is it real ? ”
184095	184117	184079	184079	She	227	“ It is I , Pip . Mr. Jaggers gave me your note yesterday , and I have lost no time . ”
184118	184125	184079	184079	She	227	“ Thank you . Thank you . ”
184158	184162	184163	184163	she	227	“ I want , ”
184166	184210	184163	184163	she	227	“ to pursue that subject you mentioned to me when you were last here , and to show you that I am not all stone . But perhaps you can never believe , now , that there is anything human in my heart ? ”
184253	184286	184236	184236	she	227	“ You said , speaking for your friend , that you could tell me how to do something useful and good . Something that you would like done , is it not ? ”
184287	184297	184331	184331	she	227	“ Something that I would like done very much . ”
184298	184303	184304	184304	I	0	“ What is it ? ”
184375	184381	184382	184382	she	227	“ Do you break off , ”
184396	184410	184387	184387	her	227	“ because you hate me too much to bear to speak to me ? ”
184411	184416	184417	184417	I	0	“ No , no , ”
184420	184443	184417	184417	I	0	“ how can you think so , Miss Havisham ! I stopped because I thought you were not following what I said . ”

184592	184604	184579	184579	she	227	“ And how much money is wanting to complete the purchase ? ”
184620	184625	184605	184605	I	0	“ Nine hundred pounds . ”

184841	184868	184869	184869	She	227	“ Nothing . I thank you for the question . I thank you even more for the tone of the question . But there is nothing . ”

184952	185002	185023	185023	She	227	“ This is an authority to him to pay you that money , to lay out at your irresponsible discretion for your friend . I keep no money here ; but if you would rather Mr. Jaggers knew nothing of the matter , I will send it to you . ”
185003	185022	185023	185023	She	227	“ Thank you , Miss Havisham ; I have not the least objection to receiving it from him . ”

185395	185431	185378	185378	she	227	“ If you mean , Miss Havisham , what have you done to injure me , let me answer . Very little . I should have loved her under any circumstances . Is she married ? ”

But Estella is a different case , and if you can ever undo any scrap of what you have done amiss in keeping a part of her right nature away from her , it will be better to do that than to bemoan the past through a hundred years . ”
185826	185842	185852	185852	her	227	“ Yes , yes , I know it . But , Pip — my dear ! ”

185970	185973	185974	185974	I	0	“ Better , ”

186063	186140	186054	186054	I	0	“ I believe I may say that I do know your story , and have known it ever since I first left this neighbourhood . It has inspired me with great commiseration , and I hope I understand it and its influences . Does what has passed between us give me any excuse for asking you a question relative to Estella ? Not as she is , but as she was when she first came here ? ”
186176	186180	186163	186163	She	3549	“ Go on . ”

I had first seen him when I sent for him to lay this place waste for me ; having read of him in the newspapers , before I and the world parted . He told me that he would look about him for such an orphan child . One night he brought her here asleep , and I called her Estella . ”
186361	186369	186237	186237	She	3549	“ Might I ask her age then ? ”
186370	186392	186237	186237	She	3549	“ Two or three . She herself knows nothing , but that she was left an orphan and I adopted her . ”

I doubt if he can hold out long , though . What with rum and pepper,—and pepper and rum,—I should think his pegging must be nearly over . ”

188447	188510	188344	188344	he	282	“ How can I take care of the dear child otherwise?—Lay your arm out upon the back of the sofa , my dear boy , and I ’ll sit down here , and get the bandage off so gradually that you shall not know when it comes . I was speaking of Provis . Do you know , Handel , he improves ? ”
188511	188527	188379	188379	Herbert	282	“ I said to you I thought he was softened when I last saw him . ”
188528	188573	188574	188574	I	0	“ So you did . And so he is . He was very communicative last night , and told me more of his life . You remember his breaking off here about some woman that he had had great trouble with.—Did I hurt you ? ”

188611	188644	188574	188574	I	0	“ Well ! He went into that part of his life , and a dark wild part it is . Shall I tell you ? Or would it worry you just now ? ”
188645	188655	188656	188656	Herbert	282	“ Tell me by all means . Every word . ”
188685	188691	188692	188692	he	282	“ Your head is cool ? ”

188724	188788	188722	188722	Herbert	282	“ — there ’s a bandage off most charmingly , and now comes the cool one,—makes you shrink at first , my poor dear fellow , do n’t it ? but it will be comfortable presently,—it seems that the woman was a young woman , and a jealous woman , and a revengeful woman ; revengeful , Handel , to the last degree . ”
188789	188795	188703	188703	I.	0	“ To what last degree ? ”
188796	188807	188703	188703	I.	0	“ Murder.—Does it strike too cold on that sensitive place ? ”
188808	188825	188722	188722	Herbert	282	“ I do n’t feel it . How did she murder ? Whom did she murder ? ”
188826	188841	188843	188843	Herbert	282	“ Why , the deed may not have merited quite so terrible a name , ”
188845	188931	188843	188843	Herbert	282	“ but , she was tried for it , and Mr. Jaggers defended her , and the reputation of that defence first made his name known to Provis . It was another and a stronger woman who was the victim , and there had been a struggle — in a barn . Who began it , or how fair it was , or how unfair , may be doubtful ; but how it ended is certainly not doubtful , for the victim was found throttled . ”
188932	188940	188722	188722	Herbert	282	“ Was the woman brought in guilty ? ”
188941	188954	188703	188703	I.	0	“ No ; she was acquitted.—My poor Handel , I hurt you ! ”

188971	189125	188722	188722	Herbert	282	“ This acquitted young woman and Provis had a little child ; a little child of whom Provis was exceedingly fond . On the evening of the very night when the object of her jealousy was strangled as I tell you , the young woman presented herself before Provis for one moment , and swore that she would destroy the child ( which was in her possession ) , and he should never see it again ; then she vanished.—There ’s the worst arm comfortably in the sling once more , and now there remains but the right hand , which is a far easier job . I can do it better by this light than by a stronger , for my hand is steadiest when I do n’t see the poor blistered patches too distinctly.—You do n’t think your breathing is affected , my dear boy ? You seem to breathe quickly . ”
189126	189140	188703	188703	I.	0	“ Perhaps I do , Herbert . Did the woman keep her oath ? ”
189141	189155	188703	188703	I.	0	“ There comes the darkest part of Provis ’s life . She did . ”
189156	189165	188722	188722	Herbert	282	“ That is , he says she did . ”
189166	189176	189178	189178	Herbert	282	“ Why , of course , my dear boy , ”
189198	189210	189178	189178	Herbert	282	“ He says it all . I have no other information . ”
189211	189218	188703	188703	I.	0	“ No , to be sure . ”
189219	189224	189226	189226	Herbert	282	“ Now , whether , ”

Therefore , fearing he should be called upon to depose about this destroyed child , and so be the cause of her death , he hid himself ( much as he grieved for the child ) , kept himself dark , as he says , out of the way and out of the trial , and was only vaguely talked of as a certain man called Abel , out of whom the jealousy arose . After the acquittal she disappeared , and thus he lost the child and the child ’s mother . ”
189384	189390	188703	188703	I.	0	“ I want to ask — ”
189391	189473	188703	188703	I.	0	“ A moment , my dear boy , and I have done . That evil genius , Compeyson , the worst of scoundrels among many scoundrels , knowing of his keeping out of the way at that time and of his reasons for doing so , of course afterwards held the knowledge over his head as a means of keeping him poorer and working him harder . It was clear last night that this barbed the point of Provis ’s animosity . ”

189484	189498	189482	189482	I	0	“ and particularly , Herbert , whether he told you when this happened ? ”
189499	189554	188703	188703	I.	0	“ Particularly ? Let me remember , then , what he said as to that . His expression was , ‘ a round score o ’ year ago , and a’most directly after I took up wi ’ Compeyson . ’ How old were you when you came upon him in the little churchyard ? ”
189555	189563	188703	188703	I.	0	“ I think in my seventh year . ”
189564	189601	189482	189482	I	0	“ Ay . It had happened some three or four years then , he said , and you brought into his mind the little girl so tragically lost , who would have been about your age . ”

I have seen your pleasant home , and your old father , and all the innocent , cheerful playful ways with which you refresh your business life . And I entreat you to say a word for me to Mr. Jaggers , and to represent to him that , all circumstances considered , he ought to be more open with me ! ”

192018	192111	192015	192016	Mr. Jaggers	245	“ put this case . Put the case that a woman , under such circumstances as you have mentioned , held her child concealed , and was obliged to communicate the fact to her legal adviser , on his representing to her that he must know , with an eye to the latitude of his defence , how the fact stood about that child . Put the case that , at the same time he held a trust to find a child for an eccentric rich lady to adopt and bring up . ”

192120	192263	192015	192016	Mr. Jaggers	245	“ Put the case that he lived in an atmosphere of evil , and that all he saw of children was their being generated in great numbers for certain destruction . Put the case that he often saw children solemnly tried at a criminal bar , where they were held up to be seen ; put the case that he habitually knew of their being imprisoned , whipped , transported , neglected , cast out , qualified in all ways for the hangman , and growing up to be hanged . Put the case that pretty nigh all the children he saw in his daily business life he had reason to look upon as so much spawn , to develop into the fish that were to come to his net,—to be prosecuted , defended , forsworn , made orphans , bedevilled somehow . ”
192264	192271	192324	192324	I	0	“ I follow you , sir . ”
192272	192323	192015	192016	Mr. Jaggers	245	“ Put the case , Pip , that here was one pretty little child out of the heap who could be saved ; whom the father believed dead , and dared make no stir about ; as to whom , over the mother , the legal adviser had this power : “

192481	192581	192473	192473	Wemmick	269	“ Put the case , Pip , that passion and the terror of death had a little shaken the woman ’s intellects , and that when she was set at liberty , she was scared out of the ways of the world , and went to him to be sheltered . Put the case that he took her in , and that he kept down the old , wild , violent nature whenever he saw an inkling of its breaking out , by asserting his power over her in the old way . Do you comprehend the imaginary case ? ”
192582	192585	192473	192473	Wemmick	269	“ Quite . ”
192586	192671	192473	192473	Wemmick	269	“ Put the case that the child grew up , and was married for money . That the mother was still living . That the father was still living . That the mother and father , unknown to one another , were dwelling within so many miles , furlongs , yards if you like , of one another . That the secret was still a secret , except that you had got wind of it . Put that last case to yourself very carefully . ”
192672	192676	192473	192473	Wemmick	269	“ I do . ”
192677	192690	192473	192473	Wemmick	269	“ I ask Wemmick to put it to _ him_self very carefully . ”

I think if she had done such a deed she would be safer where she was . For the daughter ’s ? I think it would hardly serve her to establish her parentage for the information of her husband , and to drag her back to disgrace , after an escape of twenty years , pretty secure to last for life . But add the case that you had loved her , Pip , and had made her the subject of those ‘ poor dreams ’ which have , at one time or another , been in the heads of more men than you think likely , then I tell you that you had better — and would much sooner when you had thought well of it — chop off that bandaged left hand of yours with your bandaged right hand , and then pass the chopper on to Wemmick there , to cut _ that _ off too . ”

I kept my ears open , seeming to have them shut , until I heard that he was absent , and I thought that would be the best time for making the attempt . I can only suppose now , that it was a part of his policy , as a very clever man , habitually to deceive his own instruments . You do n’t blame me , I hope , Mr. Pip ?

But what I look at is this . The late Compeyson having been beforehand with him in intelligence of his return , and being so determined to bring him to book , I do not think he could have been saved . Whereas , the portable property certainly could have been saved . That ’s the difference between the property and the owner , do n’t you see ? ”

220456	220654	220655	220655	Biddy	186	” Enclosed in the letter was a receipt for the debt and costs on which I had been arrested . Down to that moment , I had vainly supposed that my creditor had withdrawn , or suspended proceedings until I should be quite recovered . I had never dreamed of Joe ’s having paid the money ; but Joe had paid it , and the receipt was in his name . What remained for me now , but to follow him to the dear old forge , and there to have out my disclosure to him , and my penitent remonstrance with him , and there to relieve my mind and heart of that reserved Secondly , which had begun as a vague something lingering in my thoughts , and had formed into a settled purpose ? The purpose was , that I would go to Biddy , that I would show her how humbled and repentant I came back , that I would tell her how I had lost all I once hoped for , that I would remind her of our old confidences in my first unhappy time . Then I would say to her , “
220891	221391	221392	221393	Young man	4470	” Such was my purpose . After three days more of recovery , I went down to the old place to put it in execution . And how I sped in it is all I have left to tell . Chapter LVIII . The tidings of my high fortunes having had a heavy fall had got down to my native place and its neighbourhood before I got there . I found the Blue Boar in possession of the intelligence , and I found that it made a great change in the Boar ’s demeanour . Whereas the Boar had cultivated my good opinion with warm assiduity when I was coming into property , the Boar was exceedingly cool on the subject now that I was going out of property . It was evening when I arrived , much fatigued by the journey I had so often made so easily . The Boar could not put me into my usual bedroom , which was engaged ( probably by some one who had expectations ) , and could only assign me a very indifferent chamber among the pigeons and post - chaises up the yard . But I had as sound a sleep in that lodging as in the most superior accommodation the Boar could have given me , and the quality of my dreams was about the same as in the best bedroom . Early in the morning , while my breakfast was getting ready , I strolled round by Satis House . There were printed bills on the gate and on bits of carpet hanging out of the windows , announcing a sale by auction of the Household Furniture and Effects , next week . The House itself was to be sold as old building materials , and pulled down . LOT 1 was marked in whitewashed knock - knee letters on the brew house ; LOT 2 on that part of the main building which had been so long shut up . Other lots were marked off on other parts of the structure , and the ivy had been torn down to make room for the inscriptions , and much of it trailed low in the dust and was withered already . Stepping in for a moment at the open gate , and looking around me with the uncomfortable air of a stranger who had no business there , I saw the auctioneer ’s clerk walking on the casks and telling them off for the information of a catalogue - compiler , pen in hand , who made a temporary desk of the wheeled chair I had so often pushed along to the tune of Old Clem . When I got back to my breakfast in the Boar ’s coffee - room , I found Mr. Pumblechook conversing with the landlord . Mr. Pumblechook ( not improved in appearance by his late nocturnal adventure ) was waiting for me , and addressed me in the following terms : — “
221417	221445	221446	221446	William	425	” As he extended his hand with a magnificently forgiving air , and as I was broken by illness and unfit to quarrel , I took it . “
221448	221456	221446	221446	William	425	” said Mr. Pumblechook to the waiter , “
221476	221519	221520	221520	William	425	” I frowningly sat down to my breakfast . Mr. Pumblechook stood over me and poured out my tea — before I could touch the teapot — with the air of a benefactor who was resolved to be true to the last . “
221522	221529	221520	221520	William	425	” said Mr. Pumblechook , mournfully , “
221539	221543	221544	221544	I	0	” addressing me , “
221569	221570	221563	221563	William	425	” “
221574	221580	221563	221563	William	425	” said I , shortly , “
221588	221589	221582	221582	I	0	” “
221596	221629	221590	221590	You	425	” returned Mr. Pumblechook , sighing and nodding his head several times , as if he might have expected that , and as if abstinence from watercresses were consistent with my downfall . “
221649	221677	221647	221647	William	425	” I went on with my breakfast , and Mr. Pumblechook continued to stand over me , staring fishily and breathing noisily , as he always did . “
221685	221692	221696	221696	he	0	” mused Mr. Pumblechook , aloud . “
221730	221756	221758	221758	I	0	” This reminded me of the wonderful difference between the servile manner in which he had offered his hand in my new prosperity , saying , “
221760	221778	221758	221758	I	0	” and the ostentatious clemency with which he had just now exhibited the same fat five fingers . “
221781	221793	221758	221758	I	0	” he went on , handing me the bread and butter . “
221803	221804	221796	221796	you	0	” “
221810	221820	221796	221796	you	0	” said I , firing in spite of myself , “
221837	221857	221860	221861	young man	4470	” It was the worst course I could have taken , because it gave Pumblechook the opportunity he wanted . “
221863	221899	221900	221900	I	0	” said he , releasing the handle of the article in question , retiring a step or two from my table , and speaking for the behoof of the landlord and waiter at the door , “
221964	221984	221987	221987	him	4359	” said Pumblechook , turning to the landlord and waiter , and pointing me out at arm ’s length , “
222015	222032	222008	222008	I	0	” A low murmur from the two replied . The waiter appeared to be particularly affected . “
222037	222041	222035	222035	him	4359	” said Pumblechook , “
222097	222119	222120	222121	Young man	4470	” The waiter seemed convinced that I could not deny it , and that it gave the case a black look . “
222123	222137	222138	222138	you	4470	” said Pumblechook , screwing his head at me in the old fashion , “
222179	222195	222164	222164	I	0	” The waiter coughed , as if he modestly invited me to get over that . “
222198	222224	222225	222225	I	0	” said Pumblechook , and all this with a most exasperating air of saying in the cause of virtue what was perfectly convincing and conclusive , “
222269	222270	222261	222261	Potkins	427	” “
222277	222281	222275	222275	sir	4442	” said William . “
222286	222290	222275	222275	sir	4442	” pursued Pumblechook , “
222308	222353	222306	222306	you	4470	“ Joseph , I have this day seen my earliest benefactor and the founder of my fortun ’s . I will name no names , Joseph , but so they are pleased to call him up town , and I have seen that man . ”
222354	222364	222366	222366	I.	4470	“ I swear I do n’t see him here , ”
222367	222372	222374	222374	Pumblechook	174	“ Say that likewise , ”
222376	222390	222374	222374	Pumblechook	174	“ Say you said that , and even Joseph will probably betray surprise . ”
222391	222398	222400	222400	I.	4470	“ There you quite mistake him , ”
222401	222406	222400	222400	I.	4470	“ I know better . ”
222407	222411	222412	222412	Pumblechook	174	“ Says you , ”
222416	222482	222412	222412	Pumblechook	174	“ ‘ Joseph , I have seen that man , and that man bears you no malice and bears me no malice . He knows your character , Joseph , and is well acquainted with your pig - headedness and ignorance ; and he knows my character , Joseph , and he knows my want of gratitoode . Yes , Joseph , ’ says you , ”
222493	222540	222486	222486	his	174	“ ‘ he knows my total deficiency of common human gratitoode . _ He _ knows it , Joseph , as none can . _ You _ do not know it , Joseph , having no call to know it , but that man do . ’ ”
222563	222688	222552	222552	he	428	“ Says you , ‘ Joseph , he gave me a little message , which I will now repeat . It was that , in my being brought low , he saw the finger of Providence . He knowed that finger when he saw Joseph , and he saw it plain . It pinted out this writing , Joseph . _ Reward of ingratitoode to his earliest benefactor , and founder of fortun ’s _ . But that man said he did not repent of what he had done , Joseph . Not at all . It was right to do it , it was kind to do it , it was benevolent to do it , and he would do it again . ’ ”
222689	222694	222696	222696	I	0	“ It ’s pity , ”
222707	222723	222696	222696	I	0	“ that the man did not say what he had done and would do again . ”
222724	222730	222731	222731	Pumblechook	174	“ Squires of the Boar ! ”
222738	222790	222731	222731	Pumblechook	174	“ and William ! I have no objections to your mentioning , either up town or down town , if such should be your wishes , that it was right to do it , kind to do it , benevolent to do it , and that I would do it again . ”
222826	222829	222830	222830	I	0	“ it . ”
223466	223476	223456	223456	she	186	“ But dear Biddy , how smart you are ! ”
223477	223483	223456	223456	she	186	“ Yes , dear Pip . ”
223484	223495	223456	223456	she	186	“ And Joe , how smart _ you _ are ! ”
223496	223506	223507	223507	I	0	“ Yes , dear old Pip , old chap . ”
223523	223531	223533	223533	Biddy	186	“ It ’s my wedding - day ! ”
223541	223549	223533	223533	Biddy	186	“ and I am married to Joe ! ”
223591	223606	223608	223608	Joe	158	“ Which he warn’t strong enough , my dear , fur to be surprised , ”
223614	223632	223611	223611	Biddy	186	“ I ought to have thought of it , dear Joe , but I was too happy . ”
223730	223734	223736	223736	I	0	“ Dear Biddy , ”
223738	223776	223736	223736	I	0	“ you have the best husband in the whole world , and if you could have seen him by my bed you would have — But no , you could n’t love him better than you do . ”
223777	223785	223787	223787	Biddy	186	“ No , I could n’t indeed , ”
223789	223827	223787	223787	Biddy	186	“ And , dear Joe , you have the best wife in the whole world , and she will make you as happy as even you deserve to be , you dear , good , noble Joe ! ”
223846	223987	223840	223840	his	4400	“ And Joe and Biddy both , as you have been to church to - day , and are in charity and love with all mankind , receive my humble thanks for all you have done for me , and all I have so ill repaid ! And when I say that I am going away within the hour , for I am soon going abroad , and that I shall never rest until I have worked for the money with which you have kept me out of prison , and have sent it to you , do n’t think , dear Joe and Biddy , that if I could repay it a thousand times over , I suppose I could cancel a farthing of the debt I owe you , or that I would do so if I could ! ”
224005	224126	223988	223988	They	4401	“ But I must say more . Dear Joe , I hope you will have children to love , and that some little fellow will sit in this chimney - corner of a winter night , who may remind you of another little fellow gone out of it for ever . Do n’t tell him , Joe , that I was thankless ; do n’t tell him , Biddy , that I was ungenerous and unjust ; only tell him that I honoured you both , because you were both so good and true , and that , as your child , I said it would be natural to him to grow up a much better man than I did . ”
224127	224135	224137	224137	Joe	158	“ I ai n’t a - going , ”
224144	224168	224137	224137	Joe	158	“ to tell him nothink o ’ that natur , Pip . Nor Biddy ai n’t . Nor yet no one ai n’t . ”
224169	224245	223988	223988	They	4401	“ And now , though I know you have already done it in your own kind hearts , pray tell me , both , that you forgive me ! Pray let me hear you say the words , that I may carry the sound of them away with me , and then I shall be able to believe that you can trust me , and think better of me , in the time to come ! ”
224246	224255	224257	224257	Joe	158	“ O dear old Pip , old chap , ”
224259	224274	224257	224257	Joe	158	“ God knows as I forgive you , if I have anythink to forgive ! ”
224275	224284	224286	224286	Biddy	186	“ Amen ! And God knows I do ! ”
224288	224346	224286	224286	Biddy	186	“ Now let me go up and look at my old little room , and rest there a few minutes by myself . And then , when I have eaten and drunk with you , go with me as far as the finger - post , dear Joe and Biddy , before we say good - bye ! ”
224825	224842	224844	224844	Joe	158	“ We giv ’ him the name of Pip for your sake , dear old chap , ”
224870	224889	224849	224849	I	0	“ and we hoped he might grow a little bit like you , and we think he do . ”
224967	224970	224972	224972	I	0	“ Biddy , ”
224992	225012	224975	224975	I	0	“ you must give Pip to me one of these days ; or lend him , at all events . ”
225013	225018	225020	225020	Biddy	186	“ No , no , ”
225024	225029	225020	225020	Biddy	186	“ You must marry . ”
225030	225072	225073	225073	Biddy	186	“ So Herbert and Clara say , but I do n’t think I shall , Biddy . I have so settled down in their home , that it ’s not at all likely . I am already quite an old bachelor . ”
225133	225137	225139	225139	Biddy	186	“ Dear Pip , ”
225141	225152	225139	225139	Biddy	186	“ you are sure you do n’t fret for her ? ”
225153	225161	225181	225181	Biddy	186	“ O no,—I think not , Biddy . ”
225162	225178	225181	225181	Biddy	186	“ Tell me as an old , old friend . Have you quite forgotten her ? “
225229	225688	225689	225689	Estella	196	” Nevertheless , I knew , while I said those words , that I secretly intended to revisit the site of the old house that evening , alone , for her sake . Yes , even so . For Estella ’s sake . I had heard of her as leading a most unhappy life , and as being separated from her husband , who had used her with great cruelty , and who had become quite renowned as a compound of pride , avarice , brutality , and meanness . And I had heard of the death of her husband , from an accident consequent on his ill - treatment of a horse . This release had befallen her some two years before ; for anything I knew , she was married again . The early dinner hour at Joe ’s , left me abundance of time , without hurrying my talk with Biddy , to walk over to the old spot before dark . But , what with loitering on the way to look at old objects and to think of old times , the day had quite declined when I came to the place . There was no house now , no brewery , no building whatever left , but the wall of the old garden . The cleared space had been enclosed with a rough fence , and looking over it , I saw that some of the old ivy had struck root anew , and was growing green on low quiet mounds of ruin . A gate in the fence standing ajar , I pushed it open , and went in . A cold silvery mist had veiled the afternoon , and the moon was not yet up to scatter it . But , the stars were shining beyond the mist , and the moon was coming , and the evening was not dark . I could trace out where every part of the old house had been , and where the brewery had been , and where the gates , and where the casks . I had done so , and was looking along the desolate garden walk , when I beheld a solitary figure in it . The figure showed itself aware of me , as I advanced . It had been moving towards me , but it stood still . As I drew nearer , I saw it to be the figure of a woman . As I drew nearer yet , it was about to turn away , when it stopped , and let me come up with it . Then , it faltered , as if much surprised , and uttered my name , and I cried out , — “
225691	225692	225689	225689	Estella	196	” “
225704	225783	225700	225700	you	196	” The freshness of her beauty was indeed gone , but its indescribable majesty and its indescribable charm remained . Those attractions in it , I had seen before ; what I had never seen before , was the saddened , softened light of the once proud eyes ; what I had never felt before was the friendly touch of the once insensible hand . We sat down on a bench that was near , and I said , “
225814	225815	225816	225816	I	0	” “
225823	225824	225816	225816	I	0	” “
225827	225892	225893	225893	I	0	” The moon began to rise , and I thought of the placid look at the white ceiling , which had passed away . The moon began to rise , and I thought of the pressure on my hand when I had spoken the last words he had heard on earth . Estella was the next to break the silence that ensued between us . “
225918	225967	225969	225969	you	0	” The silvery mist was touched with the first rays of the moonlight , and the same rays touched the tears that dropped from her eyes . Not knowing that I saw them , and setting herself to get the better of them , she said quietly , — “
225987	225988	225969	225969	you	0	” “
225993	225994	225969	225969	you	0	” “

226077	226089	226075	226075	you	0	” she said , in a voice of touching interest to a wanderer,—“you
226094	226095	226075	226075	you	0	” “
226098	226099	226075	226075	you	0	” “

226137	226141	226143	226143	you	0	” said Estella . “
226145	226146	226143	226143	you	0	” “
226207	226208	226197	226197	I	0	” “
226219	226232	226213	226213	your	0	” I answered . And we were silent again until she spoke . “
226237	226241	226213	226213	your	0	” said Estella , “
226264	226265	226256	226256	I	0	” “
226298	226299	226301	226301	you	0	” “
226306	226313	226301	226301	you	0	” returned Estella , very earnestly , “
226403	226404	226435	226435	Estella	196	” “
226409	226426	226435	226435	Estella	196	” said I , rising and bending over her , as she rose from the bench . “
