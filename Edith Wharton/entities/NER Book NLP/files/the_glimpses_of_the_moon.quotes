100	111	112	113	her husband	327	“ Yes -- or the loan of Strefford ’s villa , ”
145	166	112	113	her husband	327	“ Oh , come when we ’d five to choose from . At least if you count the Chicago flat . ”
167	175	176	176	He	327	“ So we had -- you wonder ! ”
218	256	208	208	she	159	“ Or , not counting the flat -- for I hate to brag -- just consider the others : Violet Melrose ’s place at Versailles , your aunt ’s villa at Monte Carlo -- and a moor ! ”
302	307	308	308	he	327	“ Poor old Fred ! ”
318	322	313	313	she	159	“ Oh , well-- ”
383	448	377	378	Nick Lansing	163	“ Versailles in May would have been impossible : all our Paris crowd would have run us down within twenty - four hours . And Monte Carlo is ruled out because it ’s exactly the kind of place everybody expected us to go . So -- with all respect to you -- it was n’t much of a mental strain to decide on Como . ”
459	479	449	450	His wife	332	“ It took a good deal of argument to convince you that we could face the ridicule of Como ! ”
480	529	530	530	She	332	“ Well , I should have preferred something in a lower key ; at least I thought I should till we got here . Now I see that this place is idiotic unless one is perfectly happy ; and that then it’s -- as good as any other . ”
537	564	565	565	She	332	“ And I must say that Streffy has done things to a turn . Even the cigars -- who do you suppose gave him those cigars ? ”
569	580	565	565	She	332	“ You ’ll miss them when we have to go . ”
581	625	449	450	His wife	332	“ Oh , I say , do n’t let ’s talk to - night about going . Are n’t we outside of time and space ... ? Smell that guinea - a - bottle stuff over there : what is it ? Stephanotis ? ”
626	669	670	670	They	333	“ Y -- yes .... I suppose so . Or gardenias .... Oh , the fire - flies ! Look ... there , against that splash of moonlight on the water . Apples of silver in a net - work of gold .... ”
694	699	700	700	Lansing	163	“ I could bear , ”
703	711	700	700	Lansing	163	“ even a nightingale at this moment .... ”
737	757	758	758	Susy	159	“ It ’s a little late in the year for them : they ’re ending just as we begin . ”
761	780	758	758	Susy	159	“ I hope when our turn comes we shall say good - bye to each other as sweetly . ”
791	808	758	758	Susy	159	“ They ’re not saying good - bye , but only settling down to family cares . ”
969	975	976	976	she	159	“ I have been thinking , ”
979	996	976	976	she	159	“ that we ought to be able to make it last at least a year longer . ”
1031	1035	1036	1036	he	327	“ You mean , ”
1042	1050	1036	1036	he	327	“ without counting your grandmother ’s pearls ? ”
1051	1058	1059	1059	He	327	“ Yes -- without the pearls . ”
1072	1079	1059	1059	He	327	“ Tell me again just how . ”
1080	1096	1097	1097	He	327	“ Let ’s sit down , then . No , I like the cushions best . ”
1197	1211	1212	1212	Susy	159	“ People with a balance ca n’t be as happy as all this , ”
1376	1385	1386	1386	she	159	“ After all , we owe them this ! ”

1680	1705	1709	1709	her	159	“ His wife ! As if he could ever have one ! For he ’s not the kind to marry for a yacht either . ”
1904	1909	1889	1891	Mrs. Fred Gillow	167	“ making herself ridiculous . ”
1910	1912	1914	1914	Susy	159	“ Ah-- ”
1931	1934	1936	1937	Ursula Gillow	168	“ Yes , ”
1942	1969	1936	1937	Ursula Gillow	168	“ before you interfered Nick liked me awfully ... and , of course , I do n’t want to reproach you ... but when I think .... ”
2047	2065	2066	2066	Susy	159	“ Of course , what you fancy is perfect nonsense , Ursula ; and as to my interfering-- ”
2073	2091	2092	2092	She	159	“ But if it will make you any happier I ’ll arrange to see him less often .... ”
2203	2213	2214	2214	she	159	“ Oh , if only it were a novel ! ”
2569	2597	2598	2598	he	170	“ But I give you my word it ’s a raving - mad mistake ! And I do n’t believe she ever meant me , to begin with-- ”
2619	2651	2602	2602	Susy	159	“ You can trust Ursula to make herself clear on such occasions . And it does n’t make any difference what you think . All that matters is what she believes . ”
2652	2672	2673	2673	Susy	159	“ Oh , come ! I ’ve got a word to say about that too , have n’t I ? ”
2707	2716	2717	2717	she	159	“ Not as far as I ’m concerned , ”
2721	2735	2717	2717	she	159	“ How do you mean ? If I ’m as free as air-- ? ”
2736	2741	2742	2742	He	170	“ I ’m not . ”
2746	2761	2762	2762	he	170	“ Oh , then , of course-- . It only seems a little odd , ”
2766	2781	2762	2762	he	170	“ that in that case , the protest should have come from Mrs. Gillow . ”
2782	2808	2717	2717	she	159	“ Instead of coming from my millionaire bridegroom , Oh , I have n’t any ; in that respect I ’m as free as you . ”
2809	2823	2824	2824	Susy	159	“ Well , then-- ? Have n’t we only got to stay free ? ”
2844	2870	2826	2826	her	159	“ I said I was as free in that respect . I ’m not going to marry -- and I do n’t suppose you are ? ”
2871	2876	2877	2877	he	170	“ God , no ! ”
2881	2891	2877	2877	he	170	“ But that does n’t always imply complete freedom .... ”
2930	2940	2941	2941	he	170	“ Was that what you came to tell me ? ”
2944	2977	2941	2941	he	170	“ Oh , you do n’t understand -- and I do n’t see why you do n’t , since we ’ve knocked about so long among exactly the same kind of people . ”
2990	2999	3000	3000	He	170	“ I do wish you ’d help me-- ! ”
3010	3049	3050	3050	Susy	159	“ Help you to tell me that poor Ursula was a pretext , but that there IS someone who -- for one reason or another -- really has a right to object to your seeing me too often ? ”
3054	3092	3050	3050	Susy	159	“ You talk like the hero of a novel -- the kind my governess used to read . In the first place I should never recognize that kind of right , as you call it -- never ! ”
3093	3100	3101	3101	he	170	“ Then what kind do you ? ”
3108	3124	3101	3101	he	170	“ Why -- the kind I suppose you recognize on the part of your publisher . ”
3133	3141	3142	3142	she	159	“ A business claim , call it , ”
3145	3222	3142	3142	she	159	“ Ursula does a lot for me : I live on her for half the year . This dress I ’ve got on now is one she gave me . Her motor is going to take me to a dinner to - night . I ’m going to spend next summer with her at Newport .... If I do n’t , I ’ve got to go to California with the Bockheimers -- so good - bye . ”
3307	3323	3305	3305	herself	159	“ After all , I might have promised Ursula ... and kept on seeing him .... ”

4908	4918	4919	4919	he	370	“ How do they stand it , I wonder ? ”
4935	4943	4944	4944	she	171	“ It might be worth finding out , ”
4957	4991	4952	4952	he	370	“ Oh , give them a year or two more and they ’ll collapse-- ! His pictures will never sell , you know . He ’ll never even get them into a show . ”
4992	5012	5013	5013	They	426	“ I suppose not . And she ’ll never have time to do anything worth while with her music . ”
5043	5053	5054	5054	Lansing	170	“ Think of sticking here all the year round ! ”
5057	5073	5054	5054	Lansing	170	“ I know . But then think of wandering over the world with some people ! ”
5074	5108	5125	5125	he	170	“ Oh , Lord , yes . For instance , my trip to India with the Mortimer Hickses . But it was my only chance and what the deuce is one to do ? ”
5109	5115	5116	5116	she	431	“ I wish I knew ! ”
5132	5136	5125	5125	he	170	“ Knew what ? ”
5137	5168	5169	5169	They	426	“ The answer to your question . What is one to do -- when one sees both sides of the problem ? Or every possible side of it , indeed ? ”
5202	5219	5182	5182	Lansing	170	“ You mean : Nat and Grace may after all be having the best of it ? ”
5220	5240	5241	5241	Susy	159	“ How can I say , when I ’ve told you I see all the sides ? Of course , ”
5245	5268	5241	5241	Susy	159	“ I could n’t live as they do for a week . But it ’s wonderful how little it ’s dimmed them . ”
5269	5285	5286	5286	He	170	“ Certainly Nat was never more coruscating . And she keeps it up even better . ”
5289	5298	5286	5286	He	170	“ We do them good , I daresay . ”
5299	5310	5314	5314	he	170	“ Yes -- or they us . I wonder which ? ”
5443	5459	5434	5434	her	159	“ I do n’t suppose it ’s ever been tried before ; but we might-- . ”
5581	5629	5636	5636	she	159	“ I ’ve seen too much of that kind of thing . Half the women I know who ’ve had lovers have had them for the fun of sneaking and lying about it ; but the other half have been miserable . And I should be miserable . ”
5726	5744	5745	5745	she	159	“ We should really , in a way , help more than we should hamper each other , ”
5749	5845	5846	5846	she	159	“ We both know the ropes so well ; what one of us did n’t see the other might -- in the way of opportunities , I mean . And then we should be a novelty as married people . We ’re both rather unusually popular -- why not be frank!--and it ’s such a blessing for dinner - givers to be able to count on a couple of whom neither one is a blank . Yes , I really believe we should be more than twice the success we are now ; at least , ”
5852	5900	5846	5846	she	159	“ if there ’s that amount of room for improvement . I do n’t know how you feel ; a man ’s popularity is so much less precarious than a girl’s -- but I know it would furbish me up tremendously to reappear as a married woman . ”
5921	5965	5901	5901	She	159	“ And I should like , just for a little while , to feel I had something in life of my very own -- something that nobody had lent me , like a fancy - dress or a motor or an opera cloak . ”
6268	6278	6279	6279	she	159	“ I ’ve often fancied it all by myself , ”
6282	6295	6279	6279	she	159	“ but fancying it with you would somehow be so awfully different .... ”
6433	6437	6438	6438	he	170	“ Wake up , ”
6441	6448	6438	6438	he	170	“ it ’s bed - time . ”
7005	7007	6986	6986	he	170	“ mays ”

7293	7295	7301	7301	she	159	“ trash ”
7336	7338	7345	7345	hers	159	“ chance ”
7691	7702	7674	7674	she	159	“ Yes , I believe we can just manage it . ”
7703	7707	7674	7674	she	159	“ Manage what ? ”
7708	7726	7674	7674	she	159	“ To catch the train at Milan -- if we start in the motor at ten sharp . ”
7730	7737	7674	7674	she	159	“ The motor ? What motor ? ”
7738	7814	7823	7823	she	484	“ Why , the new people’s -- Streffy ’s tenants . He ’s never told me their name , and the chauffeur says he ca n’t pronounce it . The chauffeur ’s is Ottaviano , anyhow ; I ’ve been making friends with him . He arrived last night , and he says they ’re not due at Como till this evening . He simply jumped at the idea of running us over to Milan . ”
7815	7818	7820	7820	Lansing	170	“ Good Lord-- ”
7836	7865	7826	7826	She	484	“ It will be a scramble ; but I ’ll manage it , if you ’ll go up at once and pitch the last things into your trunk . ”
7866	7884	7885	7885	She	484	“ Yes ; but look here -- have you any idea what it ’s going to cost ? ”
7891	7934	7887	7887	her	484	“ Why , a good deal less than our railway tickets . Ottaviano ’s got a sweetheart in Milan , and has n’t seen her for six months . When I found that out I knew he ’d be going there anyhow . ”
7966	7968	7939	7939	her	484	“ manage ”
7970	7975	7976	7976	he	170	“ Oh , well , ”
7981	7997	7976	7976	he	170	“ she ’s right : the fellow would be sure to be going to Milan . ”
8062	8068	8069	8069	she	484	“ When I ’m rich , ”
8073	8091	8069	8069	she	484	“ the thing I shall hate most will be to see an idiot maid at my trunks . ”
8119	8137	8096	8096	she	484	“ Dearest , do put a couple of cigars into your pocket as a tip for Ottaviano . ”
8141	8155	8096	8096	she	484	“ Why , what on earth are you doing with Streffy ’s cigars ? ”
8156	8175	8176	8176	She	484	“ Packing them , of course .... You do n’t suppose he meant them for those other people ? ”
8185	8202	8203	8203	She	484	“ I do n’t know whom he meant them for -- but they ’re not ours .... ”
8211	8261	8203	8203	She	484	“ I do n’t see what there is to be solemn about . The cigars are not Streffy ’s either ... you may be sure he got them out of some bounder . And there ’s nothing he ’d hate more than to have them passed on to another . ”
8262	8285	8330	8330	her	484	“ Nonsense . If they ’re not Streffy ’s they ’re much less mine . Hand them over , please , dear . ”
8286	8325	8326	8326	Lansing	170	“ Just as you like . But it does seem a waste ; and , of course , the other people will never have one of them .... The gardener and Giulietta ’s lover will see to that ! ”
8347	8356	8340	8340	she	484	“ How many boxes of them are left ? ”
8357	8361	8326	8326	Lansing	170	“ Only four . ”
8362	8368	8340	8340	she	484	“ Unpack them , please . ”
8411	8426	8405	8405	She	484	“ The others are in your suitcase downstairs . It ’s locked and strapped . ”
8427	8435	8405	8405	She	484	“ Give me the key , then . ”
8436	8463	8405	8405	She	484	“ We might send them back from Venice , might n’t we ? That lock is so nasty : it will take you half an hour . ”
8464	8472	8405	8405	She	484	“ Give me the key , please . ”
8683	8692	8693	8693	he	170	“ I wonder what she ’s given them ? ”
8912	8928	8929	8929	she	159	“ I thought I liked grandeur ; but this place is really out of scale , ”
8951	8955	8956	8956	she	159	“ And yet , ”
8959	9004	8956	8956	she	159	“ Ellie Vanderlyn ’s hardly half an inch taller than I am ; and she certainly is n’t a bit more dignified .... I wonder if it ’s because I feel so horribly small to - night that the place seems so horribly big . ”
9269	9271	9297	9297	She	159	“ Private ”
9277	9293	9294	9294	Susy	159	“ What on earth can she have to say , when she hates writing so , ”
9361	9363	9365	9365	Susy	159	“ Goodness-- ”
9522	9535	9536	9536	she	159	“ Oh , go away , please , there ’s a dear , ”
9540	9555	9536	9536	she	159	“ I have n’t finished unpacking , and everything ’s in such a mess . ”
9576	9585	9586	9586	she	159	“ Here ’s something to keep you quiet , ”
9635	9716	9616	9616	she	159	“ One good turn deserves another .... Of course you and Nick are welcome to stay all summer .... There wo n’t be a particle of expense for you -- the servants have orders .... If you ’ll just be an angel and post these letters yourself .... It ’s been my only chance for such an age ; when we meet I ’ll explain everything . And in a month at latest I ’ll be back to fetch Clarissa .... ”
9762	9884	9756	9756	She	159	“ She ’s so delighted , poor darling , to know you ’re coming . I ’ve had to sack her beastly governess for impertinence , and if it were n’t for you she ’d be all alone with a lot of servants I do n’t much trust . So for pity ’s sake be good to my child , and forgive me for leaving her . She thinks I ’ve gone to take a cure ; and she knows she ’s not to tell her Daddy that I ’m away , because it would only worry him if he thought I was ill . She ’s perfectly to be trusted ; you ’ll see what a clever angel she is .... ”
9901	9954	9756	9756	She	159	“ Susy darling , if you ’ve ever owed me anything in the way of kindness , you wo n’t , on your sacred honour , say a word of this to any one , even to Nick . And I know I can count on you to rub out the numbers . ”
10297	10302	10296	10296	he	170	“ meant to write . ”
10452	10481	10447	10448	Mrs. Vanderlyn	188	“ If you ’re ever owed me anything in the way of kindness , you wo n’t , on your sacred honour , say a word to Nick .... ”
10504	10506	10447	10448	Mrs. Vanderlyn	188	“ right ”
10655	10658	10611	10611	Nelson	222	“ tight places ”
10920	10945	10906	10906	she	159	“ I ’m very tired , dearest , and my head aches so horribly that I ’ve come to bid you good - night . ”
11015	11030	11031	11031	he	327	“ I ’m so sorry : it ’s been a long day for you , ”
11050	11053	11054	11054	she	159	“ Nick ! ”
11062	11090	11054	11054	she	159	“ before I go , you ’ve got to swear to me on your honour that you know I should never have taken those cigars for myself ! ”
11313	11322	11323	11323	she	159	“ I ’m so glad you ’ve come , ”
11331	11365	11323	11323	she	159	“ I like you so very much . I know I ’m not to be often with you ; but at least you ’ll have an eye on me , wo n’t you ? ”
11366	11391	11392	11392	Susy	159	“ An eye on you ! I shall never want to have it off you , if you say such nice things to me ! ”
11421	11453	11413	11413	herself	187	“ Oh , I know I ’m not to be always about , because you ’re just married ; but could you see to it that I have my meals regularly ? ”
11454	11466	11392	11392	Susy	159	“ Why , you poor darling ! Do n’t you always ? ”
11467	11516	11517	11517	she	159	“ Not when mother ’s away on these cures . The servants do n’t always obey me : you see I ’m so little for my age . In a few years , of course , they ’ll have to -- even if I do n’t grow much , ”
11537	11560	11521	11521	She	159	“ They ’re small , but they ’re very good . I suppose you do n’t take the others when you travel ? ”
11561	11581	11524	11524	her	159	“ The others ? Bless you ! I have n’t any others -- and never shall have , probably . ”
11582	11587	11524	11524	her	159	“ No other pearls ? ”
11588	11595	11596	11596	Clarissa	187	“ No other jewels at all . ”
11599	11605	11606	11606	she	187	“ Is that really true ? ”
11618	11622	11623	11623	Susy	159	“ Awfully true , ”
11626	11641	11623	11623	Susy	159	“ But I think I can make the servants obey me all the same . ”
11670	11685	11664	11664	she	187	“ Did you have to give up all your jewels when you were divorced ? ”
11686	11689	11690	11690	Susy	159	“ Divorced-- ? ”
11701	11727	11692	11692	her	159	“ Why , what are you thinking of ? Do n’t you remember that I was n’t even married the last time you saw me ? ”
11728	11741	11742	11744	The little girl	540	“ Yes ; I do . But that was two years ago . ”
11758	11782	11746	11746	her	540	“ Are you going to be soon , then ? I ’ll promise not to tell if you do n’t want me to . ”
11783	11802	11746	11746	her	540	“ Going to be divorced ? Of course not ! What in the world made you think so ? ”
11803	11811	11813	11814	Clarissa Vanderlyn	187	“ Because you look so awfully happy , ”
12347	12348	12326	12326	She	159	“ played”--Clarissa
12689	12692	12693	12693	she	159	“ Streffy ! ”
12720	12733	12734	12734	he	570	“ It ’s all right , I suppose?--Ellie said I might come , ”
12742	12772	12734	12734	he	570	“ and I ’m to have my same green room with the parrot - panels , because its furniture is already so frightfully stained with my hair - wash . ”
13196	13209	13210	13210	Susy	159	“ He talks every language as well as the rest of us , ”
13217	13229	13210	13210	Susy	159	“ but at least he talks one language better than the others ”
13346	13349	13340	13340	Nick	170	“ foreign , ”
13458	13509	13511	13511	Susy	159	“ Writing ? Rot ! What ’s he writing ? He ’s breaking you in , my dear ; that ’s what he ’s doing : establishing an alibi . What ’ll you bet he ’s just sitting there smoking and reading Le Rire ? Let ’s go and see . ”
13515	13541	13511	13511	Susy	159	“ He ’s read me his first chapter : it ’s wonderful . It ’s a philosophic romance -- rather like Marius , you know . ”
13542	13550	13552	13552	Strefford	267	“ Oh , yes -- I do ! ”
13569	13638	13562	13562	She	159	“ You ’re stupid , Streffy . You forget that Nick and I do n’t need alibis . We ’ve got rid of all that hyprocrisy by agreeing that each will give the other a hand up when either of us wants a change . We ’ve not married to spy and lie , and nag each other ; we ’ve formed a partnership for our mutual advantage . ”
13639	13672	13562	13562	She	159	“ I see ; that ’s capital . But how can you be sure that , when Nick wants a change , you ’ll consider it for his advantage to have one ? ”
13693	13702	13703	13703	she	159	“ I hope I shall have enough common sense-- ”
13706	13731	13703	13703	she	159	“ Oh , of course : common sense is what you ’re both bound to base your argument on , whichever way you argue . ”
13747	13776	13740	13740	she	159	“ What should you do then , if you married?--Hush , Streffy ! I forbid you to shout like that -- all the gondolas are stopping to look ! ”
13777	13784	13785	13785	He	170	“ How can I help it ? ”
13794	13822	13785	13785	He	170	“ ‘ If you marry , ’ she says : ‘ Streffy , what have you decided to do if you suddenly become a raving maniac ? ’ ”
13823	13850	13740	13740	she	159	“ I said no such thing . If your uncle and your cousin died , you ’d marry to - morrow ; you know you would . ”
13851	13860	13861	13861	He	170	“ Oh , now you ’re talking business . ”
13882	13963	13863	13863	his	170	“ In that case I should say : ‘ Susan , my dear -- Susan -- now that by the merciful intervention of Providence you have become Countess of Altringham in the peerage of Great Britain , and Baroness Dunsterville and d’Amblay in the peerages of Ireland and Scotland , I ’ll thank you to remember that you are a member of one of the most ancient houses in the United Kingdom -- and not to get found out . ’ ”
13967	13980	13981	13981	He	611	“ We know what those warnings mean ! I pity my namesake . ”
13998	14010	13981	13981	He	611	“ Is there any other woman in the world named Susan ? ”
14011	14049	14073	14073	his	611	“ I hope so , if the name ’s an essential . Even if Nick chucks me , do n’t count on me to carry out that programme . I ’ve seen it in practice too often . ”
14050	14069	14070	14070	He	611	“ Oh , well : as far as I know , everybody ’s in perfect health at Altringham . ”
14113	14182	14109	14109	he	611	“ Tell me how did you manage to smooth things over with the Gillows ? Ursula was running amuck when I was in Newport last Summer ; it was just when people were beginning to say that you were going to marry Nick . I was afraid she ’d put a spoke in your wheel ; and I hear she put a big cheque in your hand instead . ”
14248	14264	14245	14245	she	159	“ I flirted with Fred . It was a bore but he was very decent . ”
14265	14280	14245	14245	she	159	“ He would be -- poor Fred . And you got Ursula thoroughly frightened ! ”
14281	14324	14325	14325	She	159	“ Well -- enough . And then luckily that young Nerone Altineri turned up from Rome : he went over to New York to look for a job as an engineer , and Ursula made Fred put him in their iron works . ”
14334	14373	14325	14325	She	159	“ Streffy ! If you knew how I hate that kind of thing . I ’d rather have Nick come in now and tell me frankly , as I know he would , that he ’s going off with-- ”
14374	14379	14380	14380	Strefford	267	“ With Coral Hicks ? ”
14386	14401	14383	14383	She	159	“ Poor Coral Hicks ! What on earth made you think of the Hickses ? ”
14402	14429	14325	14325	She	159	“ Because I caught a glimpse of them the other day at Capri . They ’re cruising about : they said they were coming in here . ”
14430	14478	14479	14479	Strefford	267	“ What a nuisance ! I do hope they wo n’t find us out . They were awfully kind to Nick when he went to India with them , and they ’re so simple - minded that they would expect him to be glad to see them . ”
14502	14505	14506	14506	he	267	“ Ah , ”
14521	14530	14518	14518	he	267	“ Coral Hicks is growing up rather pretty . ”
14531	14584	14479	14479	Strefford	267	“ Oh , Streff -- you’re dreaming ! That lump of a girl with spectacles and thick ankles ! Poor Mrs. Hicks used to say to Nick : ‘ When Mr. Hicks and I had Coral educated we presumed culture was in greater demand in Europe than it appears to be . ’ ”
14585	14621	14518	14518	he	267	“ Well , you ’ll see : that girl ’s education wo n’t interfere with her , once she ’s started . So then : if Nick came in and told you he was going off-- ”
14622	14641	14642	14642	she	614	“ I should be so thankful if it was with a fright like Coral ! But you know , ”
14648	14662	14642	14642	she	614	“ we ’ve agreed that it ’s not to happen for a year . ”
14809	14847	14804	14804	he	170	“ Poor little devil ! Who looks after her when you and Nick are off together ? Do you mean to tell me Ellie sacked the governess and went away without having anyone to take her place ? ”
14848	14858	14860	14860	Susy	159	“ I think she expected me to do it , ”
14905	14944	14945	14945	Susy	159	“ Ah , that ’s like Ellie : you might have known she ’d get an equivalent when she lent you all this . But I do n’t believe she thought you ’d be so conscientious about it . ”
14948	14970	14945	14945	Susy	159	“ I do n’t suppose she did ; and perhaps I should n’t have been , a year ago . But you see”--she
14971	14990	15071	15071	Strefford	267	hesitated--“Nick ’s so awfully good : it ’s made me look ; at a lot of things differently .... ”
14991	15024	15025	15025	Susy	159	“ Oh , hang Nick ’s goodness ! It ’s happiness that ’s done it , my dear . You ’re just one of the people with whom it happens to agree . ”
15039	15070	15025	15025	Susy	159	“ What is it that ’s agreeing with you , Streffy ? I ’ve never seen you so human . You must be getting an outrageous price for the villa . ”
15083	15110	15075	15075	his	267	“ I should be an ass not to : I ’ve got a wire here saying they must have it for another month at any price . ”
15111	15128	15129	15129	He	619	“ What luck ! I ’m so glad . Who are they , by the way ? ”
15154	15186	15131	15131	himself	619	“ Another couple of love - sick idiots like you and Nick .... I say , before I spend it all let ’s go out and buy something ripping for Clarissa . ”
15221	15228	15216	15217	Mrs. Vanderlyn	188	“ Four weeks at the latest , ”
15326	15368	15319	15319	She	159	“ I do n’t trust that green - eyed nurse . She ’s forever with the younger gondolier ; and Clarissa ’s so awfully sharp . I do n’t see why Ellie has n’t come : she was due last Monday . ”
15614	15621	15609	15609	his	267	“ And you know he writes . ”
15693	15702	15682	15682	he	200	“ Oh , if only Streffy had chosen-- ! ”
15859	15893	15846	15846	Susy	159	“ Remember you ’re here to write , dearest ; it ’s your duty not to let any one interfere with that . Why should n’t we tell them we ’re just leaving ! ”
15894	15946	15967	15968	the Hickses	177	“ Because it ’s no use : we ’re sure to be always meeting them . And besides , I ’ll be hanged if I ’m going to shirk the Hickses . I spent five whole months on the Ibis , and if they bored me occasionally , India did n’t . ”
15947	15958	15960	15960	Strefford	267	“ We ’ll make them take us to Aquileia anyhow , ”
16190	16199	16163	16163	Susy	159	“ Thank goodness she ’s not pretty too ! ”
16290	16296	16297	16297	he	170	“ Queer child , Coral , ”
16313	16407	16297	16297	he	170	“ She told me this afternoon that she ’d remembered lots of things she heard me say in India . I thought at the time that she cared only for caramels and picture - puzzles , but it seems she was listening to everything , and reading all the books she could lay her hands on ; and she got so bitten with Oriental archaeology that she took a course last year at Bryn Mawr . She means to go to Bagdad next spring , and back by the Persian plateau and Turkestan . ”
16443	16449	16450	16450	Susy	159	“ Poor Coral ! How dreary-- ”
16452	16472	16450	16450	Susy	159	“ Dreary ? Why ? A trip like that is about as well worth doing as anything I know . ”
16473	16488	16489	16489	she	159	“ Oh , I meant : dreary to do it without you or me , ”

20649	20664	20644	20644	he	170	“ Ah , but this is different , because I ’m jealous of Gillow , ”

21820	21831	21832	21832	Susy	159	“ Is Nelson going to join you at St. Moritz ? ”
21837	21901	21832	21832	Susy	159	“ Heavens , no ! He ’s coming here to pick up Clarissa and take her to some stuffy cure in Austria with his mother . It ’s too lucky : there ’s just time to telegraph him to bring my things . I did n’t mean to wait for him ; but it wo n’t delay me more than day or two . ”
21960	22005	21943	21943	she	159	“ But , Ellie , why should you wait for Nelson ? I ’m certain to find someone here who ’s going to St. Moritz and will take your things if he brings them . It ’s a pity to risk losing your rooms . ”
22016	22038	22039	22039	She	188	“ That ’s true ; they say all the hotels are jammed . You dear , you ’re always so practical ! ”
22047	22111	22039	22039	She	188	“ And you know , darling , I ’m sure you ’ll be glad to get rid of me -- you and Nick ! Oh , do n’t be hypocritical and say ‘ Nonsense ! ’ You see , I understand ... I used to think of you so often , you two ... during those blessed weeks when we two were alone .... ”
22143	22152	22153	22153	she	159	“ Poor thing -- oh , poor thing ! ”
22198	22204	22205	22205	Susy	159	“ But all the same , ”
22216	22229	22209	22209	she	159	“ I ’m glad I persuaded her not to wait for Nelson . ”
22356	22370	22354	22354	Ellie	184	“ Nick , should you hate me dreadfully if I had no clothes ? ”
22390	22404	22387	22387	he	327	“ But , my dear , have I ever shown the slightest symptom-- ? ”
22405	22430	22431	22431	He	327	“ Oh , rubbish ! When a woman says : ‘ No clothes , ’ she means : ‘ Not the right clothes . ’ ”
22437	22451	22431	22431	He	327	“ Ah , you ’ve been going over Ellie ’s finery with her . ”
22452	22473	22387	22387	he	327	“ Yes : all those trunks and trunks full . And she finds she ’s got nothing for St. Moritz ! ”
22474	22478	22479	22479	he	327	“ Of course , ”
22501	22549	22479	22479	he	327	“ Only fancy -- she very nearly decided to stop over for Nelson ’s arrival next week , so that he might bring her two or three more trunkfuls from Paris . But mercifully I ’ve managed to persuade her that it would be foolish to wait . ”
22583	22588	22589	22589	She	159	“ You ‘ managed’-- ? ”
22598	22602	22591	22591	he	327	“ But why ? ”
22603	22608	22591	22591	he	327	“ Why -- what ? ”
22609	22634	22635	22635	Susy	159	“ Why on earth should you try to prevent Ellie ’s waiting for Nelson , if for once in her life she wants to ? ”
22666	22671	22672	22672	she	159	“ Really , dearest-- ! ”
22683	22686	22682	22682	his	327	“ Why ? ”
22687	22715	22716	22716	Susy	159	“ Because she ’s in such a fever to get to St. Moritz -- and in such a funk lest the hotel should n’t keep her rooms , ”
22721	22727	22716	22716	Susy	159	“ Ah -- I see . ”
22732	22743	22728	22728	Nick	200	“ You ’re a devoted friend , are n’t you ! ”
22744	22765	22766	22767	his wife	332	“ What an odd question ! There ’s hardly anyone I ’ve reason to be more devoted to than Ellie , ”
22780	22800	22773	22773	his	327	“ Darling ! No ; nor I-- . Or more grateful to for leaving us alone in this heaven . ”
22842	22859	22860	22860	she	184	“ I should simply worry myself ill if I were n’t sure of getting my things , ”
22878	22897	22898	22898	she	184	“ After all , people who deny themselves everything do get warped and bitter , do n’t they ? ”
22949	22964	22965	22966	his hostess	809	“ Oh , I do n’t mind your laughing at me , Streffy darling , ”
22999	23032	22990	22990	herself	159	“ Of course Streffy knows everything ; he showed no surprise at finding Ellie away when he arrived . And if he knows , what ’s to prevent Nelson ’s finding out ? ”
23123	23126	23127	23127	Susy	159	“ Toccata , ”
23149	23168	23169	23169	she	159	“ You see , Streff -- oh , why should you and I make mysteries to each other ? ”
23173	23182	23169	23169	she	159	“ Why , indeed : but do we ? ”
23193	23203	23183	23183	Susy	159	“ About Ellie , I mean -- and Nelson . ”
23204	23239	23252	23252	she	159	“ Lord ! Ellie and Nelson ? You call that a mystery ? I should as soon apply the term to one of the million candle - power advertisements that adorn your native thoroughfares . ”
23240	23246	23247	23247	She	159	“ Well , yes . But-- ”
23261	23269	23270	23270	Strefford	267	“ My Susan , what ’s wrong ? ”
23273	23279	23270	23270	Strefford	267	“ I do n’t know .... ”
23280	23308	23252	23252	she	159	“ Well , I do , then : you ’re afraid that , if Ellie and Nelson meet here , she ’ll blurt out something -- injudicious . ”
23309	23316	23317	23317	Susy	159	“ Oh , she wo n’t ! ”
23322	23344	23317	23317	Susy	159	“ Well , then -- who will ! I trust that superhuman child not to . And you and I and Nick-- ”
23345	23348	23349	23349	she	159	“ Oh , ”
23355	23376	23349	23349	she	159	“ that ’s just it . Nick does n’t know ... does n’t even suspect . And if he did .... ”
23388	23411	23377	23377	Strefford	267	“ I do n’t see -- hanged if I do . What business is it of any of us , after all ? ”
23443	23453	23440	23440	she	159	“ If Nick should find out that I know .... ”
23454	23476	23477	23477	She	159	“ Good Lord -- doesn’t he know that you know ? After all , I suppose it ’s not the first time-- ”
23481	23518	23477	23477	She	159	“ The first time you ’ve received confidences -- from married friends . Does Nick suppose you ’ve lived even to your tender age without ... Hang it , what ’s come over you , child ? ”
23571	23621	23622	23622	She	159	“ Look here , Streff , you and I know that Ellie has n’t been away for a cure ; and that if poor Clarissa was sworn to secrecy it was not because it ‘ worries father ’ to think that mother needs to take care of her health . ”
23637	23640	23641	23641	he	815	“ Well-- ? ”
23656	23684	23641	23641	he	815	“ Well , Nick does n’t ... does n’t dream of it . If he knew that we owed our summer here to ... to my knowing .... ”
23698	23701	23702	23702	he	815	“ Jove ! ”
23725	23735	23736	23738	the young composer	816	“ What was left of soul , I wonder-- ? ”
23768	23789	23790	23790	he	815	“ Well , my dear , we ’ll see it through between us ; you and I -- and Clarissa , ”
23831	23847	23823	23823	Ellie	184	“ I can never hear that thing sung without wanting to cry like a baby . ”
23955	23970	23972	23974	the happy father	824	“ Well -- well -- well ! So I ’ve caught you at it ! ”
24015	24021	24003	24003	he	222	“ Hello , old Nelson , ”
24130	24133	24134	24134	he	223	“ Hullo , ”
24150	24165	24134	24134	he	223	“ Who ’s been giving my daughter jewellery , I ’d like to know ! ”
24166	24192	24193	24193	Clarissa	187	“ Oh , Streffy did -- just think , father ! Because I said I ’d rather have it than a book , you know , ”
24236	24272	24273	24273	he	222	“ What , Streffy ? Caught you at it , eh ? Upon my soul - spoiling the brat like that ! You ’d no business to , my dear chap - a lovely baroque pearl-- ”
24297	24348	24273	24273	he	222	“ Oh , had n’t I ? Why ? Because it ’s too good for Clarissa , or too expensive for me ? Of course you dare n’t imply the first ; and as for me -- I’ve had a windfall , and am blowing it in on the ladies . ”
24452	24456	24457	24457	he	222	“ A windfall ? ”
24461	24495	24497	24497	Strefford	267	“ Oh , a tiny one : I was offered a thumping rent for my little place at Como , and dashed over here to squander my millions with the rest of you , ”
24509	24520	24521	24521	He	267	“ What -- the scene of the honey - moon ? ”
24531	24596	24597	24597	Strefford	267	“ Just so : the reward of virtue . I say , give me a cigar , will you , old man , I left some awfully good ones at Como , worse luck -- and I do n’t mind telling you that Ellie ’s no judge of tobacco , and that Nick ’s too far gone in bliss to care what he smokes , ”
24611	24618	24597	24597	Strefford	267	“ I do like jewellery best , ”
24744	24757	24720	24720	his	222	“ If only I ’d known you meant to wait for me ! ”
24793	24801	24802	24802	he	222	“ Mother cares for so few people , ”
24819	24835	24802	24802	he	222	“ that I have to be with her rather more than if she were more sociable ”
24855	24859	24860	24860	he	222	“ And meanwhile , ”
24863	24875	24860	24860	he	222	“ we ’ll have all the good time that ’s going . ”
24988	24999	25000	25000	Strefford	267	“ Well -- that ’s what you call being married ! ”
25010	25019	25020	25020	Lansing	159	“ Oh , no , I do n’t ! ”
25023	25031	25032	25032	Strefford	267	“ He does . But do you know-- ”
25039	25066	25038	25038	his	267	companion--“do you know , when the Rude Awakening comes , I do n’t care to be there . I believe there ’ll be some crockery broken . ”
25067	25072	25073	25073	Lansing	159	“ Should n’t wonder , ”
25569	25592	25593	25593	Nick	170	“ Ah -- you like this too ? It ’s several centuries out of your line , though , is n’t it ! ”
25606	25621	25622	25622	she	880	“ Why should n’t one like things that are out of one ’s line ? ”
25675	25684	25685	25685	she	880	“ I ’m glad to see you alone , ”
25725	25730	25731	25731	she	880	“ I seldom do , ”
25758	25781	25747	25747	she	880	“ I wanted to speak to you -- to explain about father ’s invitation to go with us to Persia and Turkestan . ”
25782	25786	25747	25747	she	880	“ To explain ? ”
25787	25830	25747	25747	she	880	“ Yes . You found the letter when you arrived here just after your marriage , did n’t you ? You must have thought it odd , our asking you just then ; but we had n’t heard that you were married . ”
25831	25857	25747	25747	she	880	“ Oh , I guessed as much : it happened very quietly , and I was remiss about announcing it , even to old friends . ”
25999	26006	26007	26007	he	170	“ It was a dreadful temptation , ”
26012	26021	26007	26007	he	170	“ To go with us ? Then why-- ? ”
26022	26039	26040	26041	Miss Hicks	196	“ Oh , everything ’s different now : I ’ve got to stick to my writing . ”
26051	26066	26040	26041	Miss Hicks	196	“ Does that mean that you ’re going to give up your real work ? ”
26067	26074	26075	26075	He	170	“ My real work -- archaeology ? ”
26085	26107	26108	26108	He	170	“ Why , I ’m afraid it hardly produces a living wage ; and I ’ve got to think of that . ”
26161	26169	26170	26170	she	196	“ I thought it was your vocation , ”
26173	26186	26170	26170	she	196	“ So did I. But life comes along , and upsets things . ”
26187	26206	26222	26223	Miss Hicks	196	“ Oh , I understand . There may be things -- worth giving up all other things for . ”
26207	26211	26213	26213	Nick	170	“ There are ! ”
26236	26243	26244	26244	she	196	“ But your novel may fail , ”
26251	26259	26260	26260	he	170	“ It may -- it probably will , ”
26263	26272	26244	26244	she	196	“ But if one stopped to consider such possibilities-- ”
26273	26284	26247	26247	her	196	“ Do n’t you have to , with a wife ? ”
26285	26300	26301	26301	he	170	“ Oh , my dear Coral -- how old are you ? Not twenty ? ”
26326	26368	26323	26323	her	196	“ I was never young ... if that ’s what you mean . It ’s lucky , is n’t it , that my parents gave me such a grand education ? Because , you see , art ’s a wonderful resource . ”
26386	26408	26409	26409	he	170	“ You wo n’t need it -- or any other -- when you grow young , as you will some day , ”
26413	26439	26440	26440	She	196	“ Do you mean , when I fall in love ? But I am in love -- Oh , there ’s Eldorada and Mr. Beck ! ”
26468	26524	26525	26525	She	196	“ I told them that if they ’d meet me here to - day I ’d try to make them understand Tiepolo . Because , you see , at home we never really have understood Tiepolo ; and Mr. Beck and Eldorada are the only ones to realize it . Mr. Buttles simply wo n’t . ”
26535	26541	26542	26542	she	196	“ I am in love , ”
26546	26561	26542	26542	she	196	“ and that ’s the reason why I find art such a RE source . ”
26824	26836	26837	26837	he	267	“ If I ’m going to be jealous of Streffy now-- ! ”
27218	27230	27231	27231	she	188	“ You dear thing -- I’m just off , you know , ”
27234	27274	27231	27231	she	188	“ Susy told me you were working , and I forbade her to call you down . She and Streffy are waiting to take me to the station , and I ’ve run up to say good - bye . ”
27275	27280	27295	27295	she	188	“ Ellie , dear ! ”
27303	27350	27295	27295	she	188	“ No , no ! I should never forgive myself if I ’d interrupted you . I ought n’t to have come up ; Susy did n’t want me to . But I had to tell you , you dear .... I had to thank you ... ”
27407	27421	27422	27422	he	904	“ To thank me ? For what ? For being so happy here ? ”
27445	27464	27465	27465	she	188	“ For helping me to be so happy elsewhere -- you and Susy , you two blessed darlings ! ”
27502	27505	27506	27506	she	188	“ Oh , ”
27509	27522	27506	27506	she	188	“ why do you stare so ? Did n’t you know ... ? ”
27533	27554	27555	27555	Lansing	159	“ Ellie , where the deuce are you ? Susy ’s in the gondola . You ’ll miss the train ! ”
27566	27578	27560	27561	Mrs. Vanderlyn	188	“ What do you mean ? What are you talking about ? ”
27579	27615	27616	27616	He	916	“ Oh , nothing ... But you were both such bricks about the letters .... And when Nelson was here , too .... Nick , do n’t hurt my wrist so ! I must run ! ”
27958	27961	27989	27989	Strefford	267	“ sleeper , ”
27976	27988	27989	27989	Strefford	267	“ Well , my dear , we ’ve been it through , ”
28003	28006	28007	28007	Susy	159	“ Oh , ”
28024	28036	28007	28007	Susy	159	“ Poor darling , she does so like what she likes ! ”
28037	28048	28049	28049	Strefford	267	“ Yes -- even if it ’s a rotten bounder , ”
28052	28061	28049	28049	Strefford	267	“ A rotten bounder ? Why , I thought-- ”
28062	28087	28088	28088	Susy	159	“ That it was still young Davenant ? Lord , no -- not for the last six months . Did n’t she tell you-- ? ”
28093	28099	28090	28090	herself	159	“ I did n’t ask her-- ”
28100	28112	28049	28049	Strefford	267	“ Ask her ? You mean you did n’t let her ! ”
28113	28127	28128	28128	Susy	159	“ I did n’t let her . And I do n’t let you , ”
28140	28156	28133	28133	he	267	“ Oh , all right : I daresay you ’re right . It simplifies things , ”
28291	28293	28273	28273	she	184	“ surprise ”
28468	28480	28481	28481	She	159	“ Look , dearest -- wasn’t it too darling of Ellie ? ”
28519	28529	28530	28530	he	170	“ Oh , I can go you one better , ”
28574	28581	28582	28582	she	159	“ Ellie -- gave you this ? ”
28587	28595	28582	28582	she	159	“ Yes . She gave me this . ”
28601	28608	28609	28609	Lansing	159	“ Would you mind telling me , ”
28619	28632	28609	28609	Lansing	159	“ exactly for what services we ’ve both been so handsomely paid ? ”
28633	28639	28640	28640	Susy	159	“ The pearl is beautiful , ”
28656	28694	28695	28695	Susy	159	“ So are your sapphires ; though , on closer examination , my services would appear to have been valued rather higher than yours . Would you be kind enough to tell me just what they were ? ”
28705	28755	28697	28697	her	159	“ What on earth are you talking about , Nick ! Why should n’t Ellie have given us these things ? Do you forget that it ’s like our giving her a pen - wiper or a button - hook ? What is it you are trying to suggest ? ”
28887	28892	28893	28893	she	159	“ What is it ? ”
28904	28914	28915	28915	he	170	“ That ’s what I ’m here to ask , ”
28928	29012	28915	28915	he	170	“ There ’s no reason on earth , as you say , why Ellie should n’t give us presents -- as expensive presents as she likes ; and the pearl is a beauty . All I ask is : for what specific services were they given ? For , allowing for all the absence of scruple that marks the intercourse of truly civilized people , you ’ll probably agree that there are limits ; at least up to now there have been limits .... ”
29013	29040	29147	29147	her	159	“ I really do n’t know what you mean . I suppose Ellie wanted to show that she was grateful to us for looking after Clarissa . ”
29041	29057	29058	29058	he	936	“ But she gave us all this in exchange for that , did n’t she ? ”
29073	29083	29058	29058	he	936	“ A whole summer of it if we choose . ”
29087	29096	29084	29084	Susy	159	“ Apparently she did n’t think that enough . ”
29097	29113	29147	29147	her	159	“ What a doting mother ! It shows the store she sets upon her child . ”
29114	29125	29147	29147	her	159	“ Well , do n’t you set store upon Clarissa ? ”
29126	29144	29145	29145	Susy	159	“ Clarissa is exquisite ; but her mother did n’t mention her in offering me this recompense . ”
29151	29157	29145	29145	Susy	159	“ Whom did she mention ? ”
29158	29161	29163	29163	Lansing	159	“ Vanderlyn , ”
29165	29170	29163	29163	Lansing	159	“ Vanderlyn ? Nelson ? ”
29171	29208	29209	29209	Nick	170	“ Yes -- and some letters ... something about letters .... What is it , my dear , that you and I have been hired to hide from Vanderlyn ? Because I should like to know , ”
29214	29222	29209	29209	Nick	170	“ if we ’ve been adequately paid . ”
29260	29270	29253	29253	she	159	“ What is it that Ellie said to you ? ”
29275	29301	29271	29271	Lansing	159	“ That ’s just what you ’d like to find out -- isn’t it?--in order to know the line to take in making your explanation . ”
29322	29337	29338	29338	she	159	“ Oh , don’t -- don’t let us speak to each other like that ! ”
29464	29470	29471	29471	he	170	“ Poor child -- don’t , ”
29489	29495	29496	29496	he	170	“ Do n’t you see , ”
29499	29510	29496	29496	he	170	“ that we ’ve got to have this thing out ? ”
29523	29534	29535	29535	she	159	“ I can’t -- while you stand up like that , ”
29583	29588	29589	29589	he	170	“ Will that do ? ”
29602	29615	29589	29589	he	170	“ Nothing will do -- as long as you ’re not you ! ”
29616	29620	29621	29621	She	159	“ Not me ? ”
29627	29644	29621	29621	She	159	“ What ’s the use ? You accept things theoretically -- and then when they happen .... ”
29645	29653	29662	29662	he	170	“ What things ? What has happened ! ”
29668	29688	29689	29689	she	159	“ But you know all about Ellie . We used to talk about her often enough in old times , ”
29692	29698	29689	29689	she	159	“ Ellie and young Davenant ? ”
29699	29707	29621	29621	She	159	“ Young Davenant ; or the others .... ”
29708	29721	29662	29662	he	170	“ Or the others . But what business was it of ours ? ”
29722	29732	29733	29733	she	159	“ Ah , that ’s just what I think ! ”
29759	29778	29779	29779	he	170	“ We ’re outside of all that ; we ’ve nothing to do with it , have we ? ”
29782	29786	29779	29779	he	170	“ Nothing whatever . ”
29787	29814	29756	29756	his	170	“ Then what on earth is the meaning of Ellie ’s gratitude ? Gratitude for what we ’ve done about some letters -- and about Vanderlyn ? ”
29815	29821	29822	29822	Susy	159	“ Oh , not you , ”
29827	29834	29822	29822	Susy	159	“ Not I ? Then you ? ”
29845	29862	29835	29835	He	170	“ Answer me . Have you been mixed up in some dirty business of Ellie ’s ? ”
29898	29901	29902	29902	he	170	“ Answer , ”
29905	29918	29902	29902	he	170	“ I ’ve told you it was my business and not yours . ”
29929	29944	29926	29926	he	170	“ You ’ve been sending letters for her , I suppose ? To whom ? ”
29945	30017	30018	30018	she	943	“ Oh , why do you torment me ? Nelson was not supposed to know that she ’d been away . She left me the letters to post to him once a week . I found them here the night we arrived .... It was the price -- for this . Oh , Nick , say it ’s been worth it -- say at least that it ’s been worth it ! ”
30046	30051	30018	30018	she	943	“ How many letters ? ”
30052	30067	30018	30018	she	943	“ I do n’t know ... four ... five ... What does it matter ? ”
30068	30078	30018	30018	she	943	“ And once a week , for six weeks-- ? ”
30079	30082	30018	30018	she	943	“ Yes . ”
30083	30095	30018	30018	she	943	“ And you took it all as a matter of course ? ”
30096	30109	30018	30018	she	943	“ No : I hated it . But what could I do ? ”
30110	30116	30018	30018	she	943	“ What could you do ? ”
30117	30140	30018	30018	she	943	“ When our being together depended on it ? Oh , Nick , how could you think I ’d give you up ? ”
30141	30146	30147	30147	he	170	“ Give me up ? ”
30150	30195	30196	30196	she	943	“ Well -- doesn’t our being together depend on -- on what we can get out of people ? And has n’t there always got to be some give - and - take ? Did you ever in your life get anything for nothing ? ”
30202	30223	30196	30196	she	943	“ You ’ve lived among these people as long as I have ; I suppose it ’s not the first time-- ”
30224	30232	30233	30233	he	170	“ By God , but it is , ”
30238	30249	30233	30233	he	170	“ And that ’s the difference -- the fundamental difference . ”
30250	30254	30196	30196	she	943	“ The difference ! ”
30255	30301	30196	30196	she	943	“ Between you and me . I ’ve never in my life done people ’s dirty work for them -- least of all for favours in return . I suppose you guessed it , or you would n’t have hidden this beastly business from me . ”
30383	30399	30400	30400	he	170	“ You knew I would n’t have stayed here another day if I ’d known , ”
30403	30417	30400	30400	he	170	“ Yes : and then where in the world should we have gone ? ”
30418	30445	30468	30468	He	170	“ You mean that -- in one way or another -- what you call give - and - take is the price of our remaining together ? ”
30446	30452	30453	30453	she	943	“ Well -- isn’t it , ”
30456	30467	30468	30468	He	170	“ Then we ’d better part , had n’t we ? ”
30701	30717	30693	30693	she	943	“ After all -- you were right when you wanted me to be your mistress . ”
30727	30733	30718	30718	He	170	“ You -- my mistress ? ”
30761	30783	30758	30758	she	943	“ That day at the Fulmers’--have you forgotten ? When you said it would be sheer madness for us to marry . ”
30805	30823	30824	30824	he	170	“ I was right enough when I said it would be sheer madness for us to marry , ”
30834	30844	30829	30829	She	943	“ Well , that ’s easily settled . Our compact-- ”
30845	30850	30851	30851	he	170	“ Oh , that compact-- ”
30859	30871	30851	30851	he	170	“ Are n’t you asking me to carry it out now ? ”
30872	30881	30882	30882	He	170	“ Because I said we ’d better part ? ”
30885	30956	30882	30882	He	170	“ But the compact -- I’d almost forgotten it -- was to the effect , was n’t it , that we were to give each other a helping hand if either of us had a better chance ? The thing was absurd , of course ; a mere joke ; from my point of view , at least . I shall never want any better chance ... any other chance .... ”
30957	30969	30970	30970	She	943	“ Oh , Nick , oh , Nick ... but then .... ”
30990	31002	31003	31003	he	170	“ It would have been easy enough , would n’t it , ”
31006	31145	31146	31146	He	170	“ if we ’d been as detachable as all that ? As it is , it ’s going to hurt horribly . But talking it over wo n’t help . You were right just now when you asked how else we were going to live . We ’re born parasites , both , I suppose , or we ’d have found out some way long ago . But I find there are things I might put up with for myself , at a pinch -- and should , probably , in time that I ca n’t let you put up with for me ... ever .... Those cigars at Como : do you suppose I did n’t know it was for me ? And this too ? Well , it wo n’t do ... it wo n’t do .... ”
31161	31173	31157	31157	she	946	“ But your writing -- if your book ’s a success .... ”
31174	31250	31251	31251	She	946	“ My poor Susy -- that ’s all part of the humbug . We both know that my sort of writing will never pay . And what ’s the alternative except more of the same kind of baseness ? And getting more and more blunted to it ? At least , till now , I ’ve minded certain things ; I do n’t want to go on till I find myself taking them for granted . ”
31258	31276	31277	31277	He	170	“ But you need n’t ever , dear ... if you ’d only leave it to me .... ”
31282	31298	31299	31299	He	170	“ That seems simple to you , I suppose ? Well , men are different . ”
31323	31369	31370	31370	He	170	“ Time to dress , is n’t it ? Shall you mind if I leave you to dine with Streffy , and whoever else is coming ? I ’d rather like a long tramp , and no more talking just at present except with myself . ”
31693	31701	31702	31702	Gillow	168	“ But what on earth , Susy , ”
31715	31733	31702	31702	Gillow	168	“ Are you going to do in this beastly stifling hole for the rest of the summer ? ”
31734	31742	31743	31743	Strefford	267	“ Ask Nick , my dear fellow , ”
31750	31764	31765	31766	young Breckenridge	233	“ By the way , where is Nick -- if one may ask ? ”
31781	31785	31787	31787	Susy	159	“ Dining out , ”
31790	31808	31787	31787	Susy	159	“ People turned up : blighting bores that I would n’t have dared to inflict on you . ”
31819	31851	31852	31852	Strefford	267	“ The kind to whom you say , ‘ Now mind you look me up ’ ; and then spend the rest of your life dodging - like our good Hickses , ”
31896	31911	31890	31890	She	159	“ I ’ll call him up there after dinner -- and then he will feel silly”--but
32006	32027	32028	32028	she	159	“ Oh , the Hickses -- Nick adores them , you know . He ’s going to marry Coral next , ”
32044	32047	32028	32028	she	159	“ Lord ! ”
32082	32094	32095	32095	she	159	“ What ’s the matter with me ? Too much rouge ? ”
32109	32119	32120	32120	he	267	“ No : too little . Look at yourself , ”
32127	32146	32120	32120	he	267	“ Oh , in these cadaverous old looking - glasses - everybody looks fished up from the canal ! ”
32258	32272	32273	32273	Gillow	168	“ Well , what next -- this ai n’t all , is it ? ”
32392	32399	32400	32400	Susy	159	“ Why not ? What fun ! ”
32407	32441	32400	32400	Susy	159	“ Let ’s pay somebody a surprise visit -- I do n’t know who ! Streffy , Prince , ca n’t you think of somebody who ’d be particularly annoyed by our arrival ? ”
32442	32463	32464	32464	Strefford	267	“ Oh , the list ’s too long . Let ’s start , and choose our victim on the way , ”
32682	32718	32672	32672	Susy	159	“ But the Hickses -- surely that ’s their palace ? And the windows all lit up ! They must be giving a party ! Oh , do let ’s go up and surprise them ! ”
32745	32758	32759	32759	Gillow	168	“ I ca n’t see anything very thrilling in surprising the Hickses , ”
32771	32783	32768	32768	Strefford	267	“ It would surprise me more than them if I went . ”
32789	32832	32833	32833	she	159	“ You do n’t know . It may be awfully exciting ! I have an idea that Coral ’s announcing her engagement -- her engagement to Nick ! Come , give me a hand , Streff -- and you the other , Fred- ”
32849	32862	32833	32833	she	159	“ Pity I have n’t got a black cloak and a mask .... ”
32863	32871	32873	32873	Strefford	267	“ Oh , your face will do , ”
32912	32944	32899	32899	Gillow	168	“ My face ? My face ? What ’s the matter with my face ? Do you know any reason why I should n’t go to the Hickses to - night ? ”
32952	32968	32945	32945	Susy	159	“ None whatever ; except that if you do it will bore me to death , ”
32975	32982	32945	32945	Susy	159	“ Oh , in that case-- ! ”
32983	32999	33000	33000	He	267	“ No ; come on . I hear those fools banging on the door already . ”
33075	33085	33066	33066	they	989	“ Susy -- what the devil ’s the matter ? ”
33086	33121	33122	33122	She	159	“ The matter ? Ca n’t you see ? That I ’m tired , that I ’ve got a splitting headache -- that you bore me to death , one and all of you ! ”
33133	33157	33122	33122	She	159	“ Streffy , old dear , do n’t mind me : but for God ’s sake find a gondola and send me home . ”
33158	33161	33172	33173	Streff ’s	995	“ Alone ? ”
33162	33165	33122	33122	She	159	“ Alone . ”
33219	33226	33227	33227	she	159	“ Now go and amuse yourself , ”
33272	33284	33285	33285	she	159	“ But perhaps he has dropped already -- dropped for good , ”
33437	33453	33433	33433	Nick	170	“ When did the signore leave this for me ? Has he gone out again ? ”
33561	33644	33556	33556	she	159	“ Do n’t think me hard on you , dear ; but I ’ve got to work this thing out by myself . The sooner the better -- don’t you agree ? So I ’m taking the express to Milan presently . You ’ll get a proper letter in a day or two . I wish I could think , now , of something to say that would show you I ’m not a brute -- but I ca n’t . N. L. ”
33989	33995	33979	33979	Nick	170	“ a day or two . ”
34043	34065	34016	34016	She	159	“ Coffee , Giovanna , please ; and will you tell Mr. Strefford that I should like to see him presently . ”
34159	34168	34169	34169	she	159	“ But do n’t wake him on purpose , ”
34181	34192	34169	34169	she	159	“ But , signora , the gentleman is already out . ”
34193	34197	34169	34169	she	159	“ Already out ? ”
34213	34219	34220	34220	Susy	159	“ Is it so late ? ”
34225	34259	34220	34220	Susy	159	“ After nine . And the gentleman took the eight o’clock train for England . Gervaso said he had received a telegram . He left word that he would write to the signora . ”
34662	34667	34668	34668	Lansing	170	“ Hullo -- Buttles ! ”
34741	34754	34755	34755	he	170	“ No idea you were here : is the yacht in harbour ? ”
34795	34820	34821	34821	Lansing	170	“ Ah -- you’re here as an advance guard ? I remember now -- I saw Miss Hicks in Venice the day before yesterday , ”
34858	34898	34899	34899	He	208	“ May I take this seat for a moment , Mr. Lansing ? Thank you . No , I am not here as an advance guard -- though I believe the Ibis is due some time to - morrow . ”
34923	34949	34901	34901	his	208	“ Perhaps , to clear up any possible misunderstanding , I ought to say that I am no longer in the employ of Mr. Hicks . ”
34983	34986	34987	34987	Nick	170	“ Really , ”
34994	35007	34987	34987	Nick	170	“ I hope it ’s not owing to conscientious objections to Tiepolo ? ”
35017	35101	35102	35102	He	208	“ Ah , Miss Hicks mentioned to you ... told you ... ? No , Mr. Lansing . I am principled against the effete art of Tiepolo , and of all his contemporaries , I confess ; but if Miss Hicks chooses to surrender herself momentarily to the unwholesome spell of the Italian decadence it is not for me to protest or to criticize . Her intellectual and aesthetic range so far exceeds my humble capacity that it would be ridiculous , unbecoming .... ”
35163	35215	35216	35216	he	208	“ If you see me here to - day it is only because , after a somewhat abrupt departure , I find myself unable to take leave of our friends without a last look at the Ibis -- the scene of so many stimulating hours . But I must beg you , ”
35220	35248	35250	35251	Mr. Buttles	208	“ should you see Miss Hicks -- or any other member of the party -- to make no allusion to my presence in Genoa . I wish , ”
35255	35262	35250	35251	Mr. Buttles	208	“ to preserve the strictest incognito . ”
35269	35280	35263	35263	Lansing	170	“ Oh , but -- isn’t that a little unfriendly ? ”
35281	35291	35293	35296	the ex - secretary	1037	“ No other course is possible , Mr. Lansing , ”
35298	35346	35347	35347	He	208	“ and I commit myself to your discretion . The truth is , if I am here it is not to look once more at the Ibis , but at Miss Hicks : once only . You will understand me , and appreciate what I am suffering . ”
35370	35378	35380	35380	he	208	“ From the first it was hopeless , ”
35439	35443	35435	35443	the secretary who possessed “ the foreign languages ”	2469	“ the foreign languages ”
35739	35742	35718	35718	he	170	“ Everybody ? ”
35743	35820	35828	35828	his	170	“ The signora and the four gentlemen who were dining at the palace . They all went out together on foot soon after dinner . There was no one to whom I could give the note but the gondolier on the landing , for the signora had said she would be very late , and had sent the maid to bed ; and the maid had , of course , gone out immediately with her innamorato . ”
35821	35823	35825	35825	Nick	170	“ Ah-- ”
37108	37134	37135	37135	He	170	“ Tragic Yachting Accident in the Solent . The Earl of Altringham and his son Viscount d’Amblay drowned in midnight collision . Both bodies recovered . ”
37626	37797	37798	37798	I	0	“ Susy , dear [ he wrote ] , the fates seem to have taken our future in hand , and spared us the trouble of unravelling it . If I have sometimes been selfish enough to forget the conditions on which you agreed to marry me , they have come back to me during these two days of solitude . You ’ve given me the best a man can have , and nothing else will ever be worth much to me . But since I have n’t the ability to provide you with what you want , I recognize that I ’ve no right to stand in your way . We must owe no more Venetian palaces to underhand services . I see by the newspapers that Streff can now give you as many palaces as you want . Let him have the chance -- I fancy he ’ll jump at it , and he ’s the best man in sight . I wish I were in his shoes . “
37824	37875	37822	37822	NICK	170	” He added a line on the subject of their modest funds , put the letter into an envelope , and addressed it to Mrs. Nicholas Lansing . As he did so , he reflected that it was the first time he had ever written his wife ’s married name . “
37890	37924	37925	37925	I	0	” he vowed , as he groped in his pocketbook for a stamp . He stood up with a stretch of weariness -- the heat was stifling!--and put the letter in his pocket . “
37935	37939	37929	37929	myself	0	” he thought ; “
37956	38006	37953	37953	I	0	” He jammed his hat down on his head and walked out into the sun - blaze . As he was turning away from the square by the general Post Office , a white parasol waved from a passing cab , and Coral Hicks leaned forward with outstretched hand . “
38014	38018	38009	38009	I	0	” she triumphed . “
38043	38094	38019	38019	I	0	” He stared at her blankly , too bewildered even to wonder how she knew he was in Genoa ; and she continued , with the kind of shy imperiousness that always made him feel , in her presence , like a member of an orchestra under a masterful baton ; “
38113	38121	37953	37953	I	0	” To the cabdriver she called out : “
38125	38302	37953	37953	I	0	” Nick Lansing sank down beside her . As he did so he noticed a heap of bundles at her feet , and felt that he had simply added one more to the number . He supposed that she was taking her spoils to the Ibis , and that he would be carried up to the deck - house to be displayed with the others . Well , it would all help to pass the day -- and by night he would have reached some kind of a decision about his future . On the third day after Nick ’s departure the post brought to the Palazzo Vanderlyn three letters for Mrs. Lansing . The first to arrive was a word from Strefford , scribbled in the train and posted at Turin . In it he briefly said that he had been called home by the dreadful accident of which Susy had probably read in the daily papers . He added that he would write again from England , and then -- in a blotted postscript-- : “
38334	38596	38601	38601	you	1124	” The other two letters , which came together in the afternoon , were both from Genoa . Susy scanned the addresses and fell upon the one in her husband ’s writing . Her hand trembled so much that for a moment she could not open the envelope . When she had done so , she devoured the letter in a flash , and then sat and brooded over the outspread page as it lay on her knee . It might mean so many things -- she could read into it so many harrowing alternatives of indifference and despair , of irony and tenderness ! Was he suffering tortures when he wrote it , or seeking only to inflict them upon her ? Or did the words represent his actual feelings , no more and no less , and did he really intend her to understand that he considered it his duty to abide by the letter of their preposterous compact ? He had left her in wrath and indignation , yet , as a closer scrutiny revealed , there was not a word of reproach in his brief lines . Perhaps that was why , in the last issue , they seemed so cold to her .... She shivered and turned to the other envelope . The large stilted characters , though half - familiar , called up no definite image . She opened the envelope and discovered a post - card of the Ibis , canvas spread , bounding over a rippled sea . On the back was written : “
38625	38627	38612	38612	You	1124	“ CORAL ”
38647	38684	38632	38633	Violet Melrose	161	“ But why on earth do n’t you and Nick go to my little place at Versailles for the honeymoon ? I ’m off to China , and you could have it to yourselves all summer , ”
38903	38934	38898	38899	Mrs. Melrose	244	“ Oh , when I ’m sick of everything I just rush off without warning to my little shanty at Versailles , and live there all alone on scrambled eggs . ”
38947	38954	38935	38939	The perfect house - keeper	1136	“ Am sure Mrs. Melrose most happy ”
39309	39312	39313	39314	Violet Melrose	161	“ Darling ! ”
39328	39337	39313	39314	Violet Melrose	161	“ But I thought you were in China ! ”
39341	39348	39313	39314	Violet Melrose	161	“ In China ... in China , ”
39389	39409	39411	39415	the perfect house - keeper	1136	“ Well , Madam , I thought so myself till I got a wire from Mrs. Melrose last evening , ”
39434	39466	39430	39430	her	244	“ Of course , of course ! I had meant to go to China -- no , India .... But I ’ve discovered a genius ... and Genius , you know .... ”
39488	39493	39473	39473	she	159	“ Fulmer ! Fulmer ! ”
39585	39588	39589	39589	he	247	“ Susy ! ”
39600	39616	39596	39597	Mrs. Melrose	244	“ You did n’t know , then ? You had n’t heard of his masterpieces ? ”
39628	39634	39622	39622	Susy	159	“ Is Nat your genius ? ”
39645	39663	39642	39642	Fulmer	247	“ No ; I ’m Grace ’s . But Mrs. Melrose has been our Providence , and .... ”
39664	39667	39668	39669	his hostess	809	“ Providence ? ”
39672	39751	39752	39752	She	809	“ Do n’t talk as if you were at a prayer - meeting ! He had an exhibition in New York ... it was the most fabulous success . He ’s come abroad to make studies for the decoration of my music - room in New York . Ursula Gillow has given him her garden - house at Roslyn to do . And Mrs. Bockheimer ’s ball - room -- oh , Fulmer , where are the cartoons ? ”
39776	39798	39799	39799	she	809	“ I ’d got as far as Brindisi . I ’ve travelled day and night to be here to meet him , ”
39802	39808	39799	39799	she	809	“ But , you darling , ”
39819	39831	39810	39810	she	809	“ I ’m forgetting to ask if you ’ve had tea ? ”
40247	40258	40238	40238	he	247	“ Yes , I did discover him -- I did , ”
40286	40532	40259	40260	Mrs. Melrose	244	“ You must n’t believe a word that Ursula Gillow tells you about having pounced on his ‘ Spring Snow Storm ’ in a dark corner of the American Artists ’ exhibition -- skied , if you please ! They skied him less than a year ago ! And naturally Ursula never in her life looked higher than the first line at a picture - show . And now she actually pretends ... oh , for pity ’s sake do n’t say it does n’t matter , Fulmer ! Your saying that just encourages her , and makes people think she did . When , in reality , any one who saw me at the exhibition on varnishing - day .... Who ? Well , Eddy Breckenridge , for instance . He was in Egypt , you say ? Perhaps he was ! As if one could remember the people about one , when suddenly one comes upon a great work of art , as St. Paul did -- didn’t he?--and the scales fell from his eyes . Well ... that ’s exactly what happened to me that day ... and Ursula , everybody knows , was down at Roslyn at the time , and did n’t come up for the opening of the exhibition at all . And Fulmer sits there and laughs , and says it does n’t matter , and that he ’ll paint another picture any day for me to discover ! ”
40808	40816	40817	40817	she	159	“ If I wanted to be alone , ”
40820	40830	40817	40817	she	159	“ I ’m alone enough , in all conscience . ”
40845	40849	40840	40840	She	159	“ And Grace ? ”
40858	40951	40952	40952	He	247	“ Oh , she ’s here , naturally -- we’re in Paris , kids and all . In a pension , where we can polish up the lingo . But I hardly ever lay eyes on her , because she ’s as deep in music as I am in paint ; it was as big a chance for her as for me , you see , and she ’s making the most of it , fiddling and listening to the fiddlers . Well , it ’s a considerable change from New Hampshire . ”
40979	40993	40994	40994	he	247	“ Remember the bungalow ? And Nick -- ah , how ’s Nick ? ”
40999	41007	40994	40994	he	247	“ Oh , yes -- darling Nick ? ”
41028	41035	41014	41014	Susy	159	“ Most awfully well -- splendidly ! ”
41036	41044	41046	41046	Fulmer	175	“ He ’s not here , though ? ”
41048	41058	41014	41014	Susy	159	“ No . He ’s off travelling -- cruising . ”
41067	41072	41059	41060	Mrs. Melrose	244	“ With anybody interesting ? ”
41073	41086	41087	41087	She	159	“ No ; you would n’t know them . People we met .... ”
41103	41161	41162	41162	Susy	159	“ And you ’ve come for your clothes , I suppose , darling ? Do n’t listen to people who say that skirts are to be wider . I ’ve discovered a new woman -- a Genius -- and she absolutely swathes you .... Her name ’s my secret ; but we ’ll go to her together . ”
41169	41190	41162	41162	Susy	159	“ Do you mind if I go up to my room ? I ’m rather tired -- coming straight through . ”
41191	41233	41234	41234	Their	1201	“ Of course , dear . I think there are some people coming to dinner ... Mrs. Match will tell you . She has such a memory .... Fulmer , where on earth are those cartoons of the music - room ? ”
41271	41278	41279	41279	she	159	“ If we ’d come here , ”
41282	41289	41279	41279	she	159	“ everything might have been different . ”
41340	41344	41333	41333	her	159	“ Find everything ? ”
41623	41640	41618	41618	Violet	161	“ Do n’t believe the people who tell you that skirts are going to be wider . ”
41871	41891	41863	41863	she	159	“ Shall be in Paris Friday for twenty - four hours where can I see you write Nouveau Luxe . ”
41961	42005	42006	42006	She	159	“ I ca n’t give your message to Nick , for he ’s gone off with the Hickses -- I do n’t know where , or for how long . It ’s all right , of course : it was in our bargain . ”
42198	42209	42215	42215	she	159	“ It was in the bargain -- in the bargain , ”
42410	42438	42402	42403	Mrs. Match	251	“ Oh , Madam , I thought you were too tired .... I was bringing it up to you myself -- just a little morsel of chicken . ”
42464	42486	42439	42439	Susy	159	“ Oh , no , I ’m not tired , thank you . I thought Mrs. Melrose expected friends at dinner ! ”
42487	42496	42497	42498	Mrs. Match	251	“ Friends at dinner - to - night ? ”
42522	42552	42553	42556	the house - keeper	1227	“ Why , Mrs. Melrose and Mr. Fulmer were engaged to dine in Paris . They left an hour ago . Mrs. Melrose told me she ’d told you , ”
42566	42595	42561	42561	her	159	“ I must have misunderstood . In that case ... well , yes , if it ’s no trouble , I believe I will have my tray upstairs . ”
43016	43018	42985	42985	She	159	“ dead ”
43230	43268	43269	43269	he	267	“ It was horrible ... seeing them both there together , laid out in that hideous Pugin chapel at Altringham ... the poor boy especially . I suppose that ’s really what ’s cutting me up now , ”
43275	43289	43290	43290	she	159	“ Oh , it ’s more than that -- more than you know , ”
43298	43311	43294	43294	he	267	“ Now , my dear , do n’t be edifying , please , ”
43331	43345	43346	43346	he	267	“ And now about you -- for that ’s what I came for , ”
43359	43371	43346	43346	he	267	“ I could n’t make head or tail of your letter . ”
43381	43408	43372	43372	She	159	“ Could n’t you ? I suppose you ’d forgotten my bargain with Nick . He hadn’t -- and he ’s asked me to fulfil it . ”
43412	43436	43437	43437	She	159	“ What -- that nonsense about your setting each other free if either of you had the chance to make a good match ? ”
43439	43442	43502	43502	his	267	“ Yes . ”
43443	43451	43502	43502	his	267	“ And he ’s actually asked you-- ? ”
43452	43498	43502	43502	his	267	“ Well : practically . He ’s gone off with the Hickses . Before going he wrote me that we ’d better both consider ourselves free . And Coral sent me a postcard to say that she would take the best of care of him . ”
43508	43533	43502	43502	his	267	“ But what the deuce led up to all this ? It ca n’t have happened like that , out of a clear sky . ”
43626	43644	43617	43618	her companion	544	“ Do n’t tell me anything you do n’t want to , you know , my dear . ”
43645	43668	43617	43618	her companion	544	“ No ; I do want to ; only it ’s difficult . You see -- we had so very little money .... ”
43669	43672	43724	43724	Strefford	267	“ Yes ? ”
43673	43707	43708	43708	She	159	“ And Nick -- who was thinking of his book , and of all sorts of big things , fine things -- didn’t realise ... left it all to me ... to manage .... ”
43781	43788	43733	43733	she	159	“ Borrow money , you mean ? ”
43789	43799	43733	43733	she	159	“ Well -- yes ; and all the rest . ”
43816	43831	43832	43832	she	159	“ Nick suddenly felt , I suppose , that he could n’t stand it , ”
43835	43957	43832	43832	she	159	“ and instead of asking me to try -- to try to live differently , go off somewhere with him and live , like work - people , in two rooms , without a servant , as I was ready to do ; well , instead he wrote me that it had all been a mistake from the beginning , that we could n’t keep it up , and had better recognize the fact ; and he went off on the Hickses ’ yacht . The last evening that you were in Venice -- the day he did n’t come back to dinner -- he had gone off to Genoa to meet them . I suppose he intends to marry Coral . ”
43964	43976	43977	43977	he	267	“ Well -- it was your bargain , was n’t it ? ”
43982	43986	43977	43977	he	267	“ Yes ; but-- ”
43987	44010	44011	44011	She	1263	“ Exactly : I always told you so . You were n’t ready to have him go yet -- that ’s all . ”
44017	44027	44011	44011	She	1263	“ Oh , Streff -- is it really all ? ”
44028	44162	44163	44163	She	1264	“ A question of time ? If you doubt it , I ’d like to see you try , for a while , in those two rooms without a servant ; and then let me hear from you . Why , my dear , it ’s only a question of time in a palace , with a steam yacht lying off the door - step , and a flock of motors in the garage ; look around you and see . And did you ever imagine that you and Nick , of all people , were going to escape the common doom , and survive like Mr. and Mrs. Tithonus , while all about you the eternal passions were crumbling to pieces , and your native Divorce - states piling up their revenues ? ”
44186	44204	44163	44163	She	1264	“ But I ’m so young ... life ’s so long . What does last , then ? ”
44205	44231	44011	44011	She	1263	“ Ah , you ’re too young to believe me , if I were to tell you ; though you ’re intelligent enough to understand . ”
44232	44238	44011	44011	She	1263	“ What does , then ? ”
44239	44338	44163	44163	She	1264	“ Why , the hold of the things we all think we could do without . Habits -- they outstand the Pyramids . Comforts , luxuries , the atmosphere of ease ... above all , the power to get away from dulness and monotony , from constraints and uglinesses . You chose that power , instinctively , before you were even grown up ; and so did Nick . And the only difference between you is that he ’s had the sense to see sooner than you that those are the things that last , the prime necessities . ”
44339	44346	44011	44011	She	1263	“ I do n’t believe it ! ”
44347	44391	44011	44011	She	1263	“ Of course you do n’t : at your age one does n’t reason one ’s materialism . And besides you ’re mortally hurt that Nick has found out sooner than you , and has n’t disguised his discovery under any hypocritical phrases . ”
44392	44398	44163	44163	She	1264	“ But surely there are people-- ”
44399	44455	44011	44011	She	1263	“ Yes -- saints and geniuses and heroes : all the fanatics ! To which of their categories do you suppose we soft people belong ? And the heroes and the geniuses -- haven’t they their enormous frailties and their giant appetites ? And how should we escape being the victims of our little ones ? ”
44464	44489	44456	44456	She	1265	“ But , Streff , how can you say such things , when I know you care : care for me , for instance ! ”
44490	44493	44494	44494	He	1266	“ Care ? ”
44501	44543	44494	44494	He	1266	“ But , my dear , it ’s just the fugitiveness of mortal caring that makes it so exquisite ! It ’s because we know we ca n’t hold fast to it , or to each other , or to anything .... ”
44544	44561	44562	44562	She	1265	“ Yes ... yes ... but hush , please ! Oh , do n’t say it ! ”
44577	44588	44589	44589	he	1266	“ Come along , then ; where do we lunch ? ”
44602	44621	44589	44589	he	1266	“ Oh , I do n’t know . Nowhere . I think I ’m going back to Versailles . ”
44622	44646	44647	44647	She	1265	“ Because I ’ve disgusted you so deeply ? Just my luck -- when I came over to ask you to marry me ! ”
44657	44665	44651	44651	he	1266	“ Upon my soul , I did . ”
44666	44674	44589	44589	he	1266	“ Dear Streff ! As if -- now-- ”
44675	44694	44589	44589	he	1266	“ Oh , not now -- I know . I ’m aware that even with your accelerated divorce methods-- ”
44695	44720	44721	44721	He	1266	“ It ’s not that . I told you it was no use , Streff -- I told you long ago , in Venice . ”
44725	44802	44721	44721	He	1266	“ It ’s not Streff who ’s asking you now . Streff was not a marrying man : he was only trifling with you . The present offer comes from an elderly peer of independent means . Think it over , my dear : as many days out as you like , and five footmen kept . There ’s not the least hurry , of course ; but I rather think Nick himself would advise it . ”
44916	44925	44928	44928	her	1267	“ I should rather enjoy paying them back , ”
44983	45007	44974	44974	She	1267	“ Very good , then ; we ’ll lunch together . But it ’s Streff I want to lunch with to - day . ”
45008	45013	45014	45015	her companion	544	“ Ah , well , ”
45018	45035	45014	45015	her companion	544	“ I rather think that for a tête - à - tête he ’s better company . ”
45059	45062	45063	45063	he	267	“ Streff , ”
45163	45181	45159	45159	he	267	“ But what are you going to do ? You ca n’t stay forever at Violet ’s . ”
45182	45187	45188	45188	she	1267	“ Oh , no ! ”
45194	45207	45188	45188	she	1267	“ Well , then -- you’ve got some plan , I suppose ? ”
45208	45212	45213	45213	she	1267	“ Have I ? ”
45230	45256	45257	45257	She	1267	“ You ca n’t drift indefinitely , can you ? Unless you mean to go back to the old sort of life once for all . ”
45264	45279	45257	45257	She	1267	“ I ca n’t do that , Streff -- I know I ca n’t ! ”
45280	45284	45285	45285	She	1267	“ Then what-- ? ”
45295	45311	45285	45285	She	1267	“ Nick said he would write again -- in a few days . I must wait-- ”
45312	45325	45257	45257	She	1267	“ Oh , naturally . Do n’t do anything in a hurry . ”
45333	45443	45330	45330	his	267	“ Garcon , l’addition ! I ’m taking the train back to - night , and I ’ve a lot of things left to do . But look here , my dear -- when you come to a decision one way or the other let me know , will you ? Oh , I do n’t mean in the matter I ’ve most at heart ; we ’ll consider that closed for the present . But at least I can be of use in other ways -- hang it , you know , I can even lend you money . There ’s a new sensation for our jaded palates ! ”
45444	45451	45452	45452	she	1276	“ Oh , Streff ... Streff ! ”
45463	45500	45458	45458	he	1277	“ Try it , now do try it -- I assure you there ’ll be no interest to pay , and no conditions attached . And promise to let me know when you ’ve decided anything . ”
45517	45521	45522	45522	she	1276	“ I promise ! ”
46084	46101	46078	46078	She	159	“ If there ’s no letter from Nick this time next week I ’ll write to Streff-- ”
46741	46753	46754	46754	Grace	175	“ My dear ! I knew you ’d look me up , ”
46776	46803	46767	46767	she	175	“ Nat could n’t remember if he ’d given you our address , though he promised me he would , the last time he was here . ”
46951	46954	46966	46966	wife	1314	“ advantages , ”
47120	47207	47208	47208	Her	159	“ My dear , it ’s too wonderful ! He ’s told me to take as many concert and opera tickets as I like ; he lets me take all the children with me . The big concerts do n’t begin till later ; but of course the Opera is always going . And there are little things -- there ’s music in Paris at all seasons . And later it ’s just possible we may get to Munich for a week -- oh , Susy ! ”
47226	47286	47287	47287	She	159	“ Do you remember , Susy , when you and Nick came to stay at the bungalow ? Nat said you ’d be horrified by our primitiveness -- but I knew better ! And I was right , was n’t I ? Seeing us so happy made you and Nick decide to follow our example , did n’t it ? ”
47293	47357	47287	47287	She	159	“ And now , what are your plans ? Is Nick ’s book nearly done ? I suppose you ’ll have to live very economically till he finds a publisher . And the baby , darling -- when is that to be ? If you ’re coming home soon I could let you have a lot of the children ’s little old things . ”
47358	47395	47396	47397	Mrs. Fulmer	257	“ You ’re always so dear , Grace . But we have n’t any special plans as yet -- not even for a baby . And I wish you ’d tell me all of yours instead . ”
47427	47628	47629	47629	Susy	159	“ Well , you see , Nat is so taken up all day with sight - seeing and galleries and meeting important people that he has n’t had time to go about with us ; and as so few theatres are open , and there ’s so little music , I ’ve taken the opportunity to catch up with my mending . Junie helps me with it now -- she ’s our eldest , you remember ? She ’s grown into a big girl since you saw her . And later , perhaps , we ’re to travel . And the most wonderful thing of all -- next to Nat ’s recognition , I mean -- is not having to contrive and skimp , and give up something every single minute . Just think -- Nat has even made special arrangements here in the pension , so that the children all have second helpings to everything . And when I go up to bed I can think of my music , instead of lying awake calculating and wondering how I can make things come out at the end of the month . Oh , Susy , that ’s simply heaven ! ”
47724	47742	47705	47705	Susy	159	“ What ’s wrong with it ? Junie helped me choose it , and she generally knows , ”
47750	47779	47743	47744	Mrs. Fulmer	257	“ It ’s the way you wear it , dearest -- and the bow is rather top - heavy . Let me have it a minute , please . ”
47796	47816	47817	47817	She	159	“ This is the way Maria Guy or Suzanne would do it .... And now go on about Nat .... ”
47868	47954	47955	47955	Grace	175	“ Of course they ’re simply furious with each other -- Mrs. Melrose and Mrs. Gillow especially -- because each one pretends to have been the first to notice his ‘ Spring Snow - Storm , ’ and in reality it was n’t either of them , but only poor Bill Haslett , an art - critic we ’ve known for years , who chanced on the picture , and rushed off to tell a dealer who was looking for a new painter to push . ”
47967	48076	47958	47958	her	175	“ But , do you know , the funny thing is that I believe Nat is beginning to forget this , and to believe that it was Mrs. Melrose who stopped short in front of his picture on the opening day , and screamed out : ‘ This is genius ! ’ It seems funny he should care so much , when I ’ve always known he had genius -- and he has known it too . But they ’re all so kind to him ; and Mrs. Melrose especially . And I suppose it makes a thing sound new to hear it said in a new voice . ”
48083	48117	48077	48077	Susy	159	“ And how should you feel if Nat liked too much to hear Mrs. Melrose say it ? Too much , I mean , to care any longer what you felt or thought ? ”
48146	48188	48137	48138	Mrs. Fulmer	257	“ You have n’t been married long enough , dear , to understand ... how people like Nat and me feel about such things ... or how trifling they seem , in the balance ... the balance of one ’s memories . ”
48202	48207	48208	48208	she	257	“ Oh , Grace , ”
48214	48236	48208	48208	she	257	“ how can you be as wise as that , and yet not have sense enough to buy a decent hat ? ”
48479	48498	48467	48467	She	244	“ Susy darling , have you any particular plans -- for the next few months , I mean ? ”
48517	48546	48547	48547	she	159	“ Plans , dearest ? Any number ... I ’m tearing myself away the day after to - morrow ... to the Gillows ’ moor , very probably , ”
48574	48589	48567	48567	she	159	“ Oh , really ? That ’s too bad . Is it absolutely settled-- ? ”
48590	48598	48600	48600	Susy	159	“ As far as I ’m concerned , ”
48607	48677	48603	48604	The other	475	“ I ’m too sorry . You see , dear , I ’d meant to ask you to stay on here quietly and look after the Fulmer children . Fulmer and I are going to Spain next week -- I want to be with him when he makes his studies , receives his first impressions ; such a marvellous experience , to be there when he and Velasquez meet ! ”
48687	48701	48678	48678	She	475	“ And , you see , as Grace Fulmer insists on coming with us-- ”
48702	48708	48724	48725	the benefactress	1334	“ Ah , I see . ”
48709	48722	48724	48725	the benefactress	1334	“ Well , there are the five children -- such a problem , ”
48727	48758	48724	48725	the benefactress	1334	“ If you were at a loose end , you know , dear , while Nick ’s away with his friends , I could really make it worth your while .... ”
48759	48777	48724	48725	the benefactress	1334	“ So awfully good of you , Violet ; only I ’m not , as it happens . ”
48962	48976	48977	48977	she	244	“ But I ca n’t see why you ca n’t change your plans , ”
48984	48990	48977	48977	she	244	“ Ah , well , you know”--Susy

49046	49127	49128	49128	Susy	159	“ Your plans are not yours only ? But surely you wo n’t let Ursula Gillow dictate to you ? ... There ’s my jade pendant ; the one you said you liked the other day .... The Fulmers wo n’t go with me , you understand , unless they ’re satisfied about the children ; the whole plan will fall through . Susy darling , you were always too unselfish ; I hate to see you sacrificed to Ursula . ”
49227	49250	49221	49222	Mrs. Fulmer	257	“ The most wonderful thing of all is not having to contrive and skimp , and give up something every single minute ! ”
49282	49330	49275	49275	Susy	159	“ If I could possibly help you out , Violet , I should n’t want a present to persuade me . And , as you say , there ’s no reason why I should sacrifice myself to Ursula -- or to anybody else . Only , as it happens”--she

51331	51339	51310	51310	she	1377	“ That means that you really are free-- ”

51352	51366	51370	51370	he	170	“ Really off on a holiday , I mean ; not tied down . ”
51373	51383	51370	51370	he	170	“ No , I ’m not particularly tied down . ”
51384	51389	51370	51370	he	170	“ And your book ? ”

51582	51614	51577	51577	he	170	“ I suppose I dug away at it rather too continuously ; that ’s probably why I felt the need of a change . You see I ’m only a beginner . ”
51622	51635	51615	51615	She	1386	“ But later -- you’ll go on with it , of course ? ”

51662	51711	51645	51645	He	170	“ I ’ve been dreaming dreams , you see . I rather think I shall have to drop the book altogether , and try to look out for a job that will pay . To indulge in my kind of literature one must first have an assured income . ”
51809	51839	51840	51840	He	170	“ It seems a shame that with gifts like yours you should n’t find some kind of employment that would leave you leisure enough to do your real work .... ”
51844	51862	51840	51840	He	170	“ Yes -- there are a goodish number of us hunting for that particular kind of employment . ”
51871	51899	51900	51900	She	196	“ I know it ’s hard to find -- almost impossible . But would you take it , I wonder , if it were offered to you-- ? ”
51937	51976	51928	51928	she	196	“ Mr. Buttles ’s place , I mean . My parents must absolutely have some one they can count on . You know what an easy place it is .... I think you would find the salary satisfactory . ”

52206	52256	52198	52198	He	170	“ It tempts me awfully , of course . But I must wait , at any rate -- wait for letters . The fact is I shall have to wire from Rhodes to have them sent . I had chucked everything , even letters , for a few weeks . ”

54304	54308	54293	54293	she	168	“ A piano ? ”
54309	54359	54258	54258	she	168	“ Yes : for Ruan . I ’m sending one down for Grace Fulmer . She ’s coming to stay ... did I tell you ? I want people to hear her . I want her to get engagements in London . My dear , she ’s a Genius . ”
54360	54366	54367	54367	Susy	159	“ A Genius -- Grace ! ”
54370	54377	54367	54367	Susy	159	“ I thought it was Nat .... ”
54378	54384	54385	54385	Ursula	168	“ Nat -- Nat Fulmer ? ”
54389	54663	54385	54385	Ursula	168	“ Ah , of course -- you’ve been staying with that silly Violet ! The poor thing is off her head about Nat -- it ’s really pitiful . Of course he has talent : I saw that long before Violet had ever heard of him . Why , on the opening day of the American Artists ’ exhibition , last winter , I stopped short before his ‘ Spring Snow - Storm ’ ( which nobody else had noticed till that moment ) , and said to the Prince , who was with me : ‘ The man has talent . ’ But genius -- why , it ’s his wife who has genius ! Have you never heard Grace play the violin ? Poor Violet , as usual , is off on the wrong tack . I ’ve given Fulmer my garden - house to do -- no doubt Violet told you -- because I wanted to help him . But Grace is my discovery , and I ’m determined to make her known , and to have every one understand that she is the genius of the two . I ’ve told her she simply must come to Ruan , and bring the best accompanyist she can find . You know poor Nerone is dreadfully bored by sport , though of course he goes out with the guns . And if one did n’t have a little art in the evening .... Oh , Susy , do you mean to tell me you do n’t know how to choose a piano ? I thought you were so fond of music ! ”
54664	54696	54697	54697	she	1464	“ I am fond of it ; but without knowing anything about it -- in the way we ’re all of us fond of the worthwhile things in our stupid set , ”
54714	54723	54724	54724	she	1464	“ But are you sure Grace is coming ? ”
54728	54755	54724	54724	she	1464	“ Quite sure . Why should n’t she ? I wired to her yesterday . I ’m giving her a thousand dollars and all her expenses . ”
54837	54858	54859	54859	she	168	“ But what are you doing in town , darling , I do n’t remember if I ’ve asked you , ”
54936	54962	54931	54931	she	168	“ And Nick ? Nick ’s with you ? How is he , I thought you and he still were in Venice with Ellie Vanderlyn . ”
54963	54972	54973	54973	She	168	“ We were , for a few weeks . ”
54978	54997	54975	54975	her	168	“ It was delightful . But now we ’re both on our own again -- for a while . ”
55005	55018	54998	54999	Mrs. Gillow	167	“ Oh , you ’re alone here , then ; quite alone ? ”
55019	55032	55033	55033	Ursula	168	“ Yes : Nick ’s cruising with some friends in the Mediterranean . ”
55040	55063	55033	55033	Ursula	168	“ But , Susy darling , then if you ’re alone -- and out of a job , just for the moment ? ”
55067	55075	55064	55064	Susy	159	“ Well , I ’m not sure . ”
55076	55297	55298	55298	Susy	159	“ Oh , but if you are , darling , and you would come to Ruan ! I know Fred asked you did n’t he ? And he told me that both you and Nick had refused . He was awfully huffed at your not coming ; but I suppose that was because Nick had other plans . We could n’t have him now , because there ’s no room for another gun ; but since he ’s not here , and you ’re free , why you know , dearest , do n’t you , how we ’d love to have you ? Fred would be too glad -- too outrageously glad -- but you do n’t much mind Fred ’s love - making , do you ? And you ’d be such a help to me -- if that ’s any argument ! With that big house full of men , and people flocking over every night to dine , and Fred caring only for sport , and Nerone simply loathing it and ridiculing it , and not a minute to myself to try to keep him in a good humour .... Oh , Susy darling , do n’t say no , but let me telephone at once for a place in the train to - morrow night ! ”
55446	55462	55437	55437	She	168	“ I ’m so sorry , Ursula : of course I want awfully to oblige you-- ”
55470	55478	55479	55479	she	168	“ I should have supposed you would , ”
55545	55563	55564	55564	She	168	“ If I could , Ursula ... but really ... I ’m not free at the moment . ”
55574	55587	55564	55564	She	168	“ The fact is , I ’m waiting here to see Strefford . ”
55588	55594	55595	55595	Ursula	168	“ Strefford ’ Lord Altringham ? ”
55598	55619	55595	55595	Ursula	168	“ Ah , yes — I remember . You and he used to be great friends , did n’t you ? ”
55659	55751	55644	55644	Ursula	168	“ But wait a moment -- yes , it is next week ! I knew it was next week he ’s coming to Ruan ! But , you darling , that makes everything all right . You ’ll send him a wire at once , and come with me to - morrow , and meet him there instead of in this nasty sloppy desert .... Oh , Susy , if you knew how hard life is for me in Scotland between the Prince and Fred you could n’t possibly say no ! ”
56291	56302	56339	56340	Mrs. Gillow	167	“ Well , if you like , then , Ursula .... ”
56303	56332	56339	56340	Mrs. Gillow	167	“ Oh , you angel , you ! I ’m so glad ! We ’ll go to the nearest post office , and send off the wire ourselves . ”
56350	56369	56339	56340	Mrs. Gillow	167	“ And you will let Fred make love to you a little , wo n’t you , darling ? ”
56372	56379	56381	56382	Ellie Vanderlyn	184	“ BUT I ca n’t think , ”
56385	56416	56381	56382	Ellie Vanderlyn	184	“ why you do n’t announce your engagement before waiting for your divorce . People are beginning to do it , I assure you -- it ’s so much safer ! ”

56640	56663	56629	56629	Susy	159	“ Susy ! I ’d no idea you were here ! I saw in the papers that you were with the Gillows . ”
56692	56713	56673	56673	her	188	“ Are you shopping for Ursula ? If you mean to order that cloak for her I ’d rather know . ”
56766	56778	56762	56762	she	159	“ No -- to - day I ’m shopping for myself . ”
56779	56784	56785	56786	Mrs. Vanderlyn	188	“ Yourself ? Yourself ? ”
56794	56802	56785	56786	Mrs. Vanderlyn	188	“ Yes ; just for a change , ”
56807	56825	56785	56786	Mrs. Vanderlyn	188	“ But the cloak -- I meant the chinchilla cloak ... the one with the ermine lining .... ”
56826	56848	56853	56853	she	159	“ Yes ; it is awfully good , is n’t it ? But I mean to look elsewhere before I decide . ”

57672	57692	57668	57668	she	159	“ of course it shall have its nice warm winter cloak , and I ’ll choose another one instead . ”
57693	57718	57640	57640	Susy	159	“ Oh , you darling , you ! If you would ! Of course , whoever you were ordering it for need never know .... ”
57719	57747	57748	57748	Susy	159	“ Ah , you ca n’t comfort yourself with that , I ’m afraid . I ’ve already told you that I was ordering it for myself . ”
57777	57792	57793	57793	Susy	159	“ Oh , dearest -- seriously ? I did n’t know there was someone .... ”
57822	57832	57833	57833	she	159	“ Someone buying chinchilla cloaks for me ? Thanks ! ”
57837	57865	57833	57833	she	159	“ I suppose I ought to be glad that the idea did n’t immediately occur to you . At least there was a decent interval of doubt .... ”
57910	57929	57904	57904	She	159	“ I suppose everybody else will think it if you do ; so perhaps I ’d better explain . ”
57939	57976	57977	57977	She	159	“ Nick and I mean to part -- have parted , in fact . He ’s decided that the whole thing was a mistake . He will probably ; marry again soon -- and so shall I. ”
58094	58106	58086	58087	Ellie Vanderlyn	184	“ You ? You and Nick -- are going to part ? ”
58115	58132	58086	58087	Ellie Vanderlyn	184	“ Ah -- then that ’s why he sent me back my pin , I suppose ? ”
58133	58137	58138	58138	Susy	159	“ Your pin ? ”
58146	58231	58138	58138	Susy	159	“ The poor little scarf - pin I gave him before I left Venice . He sent it back almost at once , with the oddest note -- just : ‘ I have n’t earned it , really . ’ I could n’t think why he did n’t care for the pin . But , now I suppose it was because you and he had quarrelled ; though really , even so , I ca n’t see why he should bear me a grudge .... ”
58352	58366	58367	58367	she	159	“ It was not because we ’ve quarrelled ; we have n’t quarrelled , ”
58395	58410	58367	58367	she	159	“ We ’ve simply decided that our experiment was impossible -- for two paupers . ”
58411	58447	58448	58448	Ellie	184	“ Ah , well -- of course we all felt that at the time . And now somebody else wants to marry you ! And it ’s your trousseau you were choosing that cloak for ? ”
58465	58484	58455	58455	she	184	“ You lucky lucky girl ! You clever clever darling ! But who on earth can he be ? ”
58505	58525	58490	58490	Susy	159	“ Streff -- Streff ? Our dear old Streff , You mean to say he wants to marry you ? ”
58538	58675	58534	58534	Ellie	184	“ But , my dearest , what a miracle of luck ! Of course I always knew he was awfully gone on you : Fred Davenant used to say so , I remember ... and even Nelson , who ’s so stupid about such things , noticed it in Venice .... But then it was so different . No one could possibly have thought of marrying him then ; whereas now of course every woman is trying for him . Oh , Susy , whatever you do , do n’t miss your chance ! You ca n’t conceive of the wicked plotting and intriguing there will be to get him -- on all sides , and even where one least suspects it . You do n’t know what horrors women will do -- and even girls ! ”
58695	58732	58686	58686	she	1530	“ But I ca n’t think , my dear , why you do n’t announce your engagement at once . People are beginning to do it , I assure you -- it ’s so much safer ! ”

59042	59065	59039	59039	she	159	“ Why , Ellie , what on earth do you mean ? Not that you ’re going to part from poor Nelson ? ”
59077	59159	59066	59067	Mrs. Vanderlyn	188	“ I do n’t want to , heaven knows -- poor dear Nelson ! I assure you I simply hate it . He ’s always such an angel to Clarissa ... and then we ’re used to each other . But what in the world am I to do ? Algie ’s so rich , so appallingly rich , that I have to be perpetually on the watch to keep other women away from him -- and it ’s too exhausting .... ”
59160	59163	59164	59165	Mrs. Vanderlyn	188	“ Algie ? ”
59171	59263	59164	59165	Mrs. Vanderlyn	188	“ Algie : Algie Bockheimer . Did n’t you know , I think he said you ’ve dined with his parents . Nobody else in the world is as rich as the Bockheimers ; and Algie ’s their only child . Yes , it was with him ... with him I was so dreadfully happy last spring ... and now I ’m in mortal terror of losing him . And I do assure you there ’s no other way of keeping them , when they ’re as hideously rich as that ! ”
59328	59335	59336	59336	she	159	“ I think you ’re abominable , ”
59347	59364	59339	59340	The other	475	“ A - bo - minable ? A - bo - mi - nable ? Susy ! ”
59365	59394	59395	59395	Ellie	184	“ Yes ... with Nelson ... and Clarissa ... and your past together ... and all the money you can possibly want ... and that man ! Abominable . ”
59418	59439	59440	59440	she	184	“ You ’re very cruel , Susy -- so cruel and dreadful that I hardly know how to answer you , ”

59773	59817	59758	59758	Strefford	267	“ why you insist on giving me bad food , and depriving me of the satisfaction of being seen with you . Why must we be so dreadfully clandestine ? Do n’t people know by this time that we ’re to be married ? ”
59837	59840	59841	59841	she	159	“ No , ”
59848	59867	59841	59841	she	159	“ they simply think , for the present , that you ’re giving me pearls and chinchilla cloaks . ”

69640	69653	69637	69637	she	159	“ if the letter were to come from -- from your office ? ”
69659	69700	69637	69637	she	159	“ On the whole : no . If , as I take it , an amicable arrangement is necessary -- to secure the requisite evidence then a line from you , suggesting an interview , seems to me more advisable . ”
69701	69710	69711	69711	She	159	“ An interview ? Is an interview necessary ? ”
69744	69773	69774	69774	she	159	“ Oh , please write to him -- I ca n’t ! And I ca n’t see him ! Oh , ca n’t you arrange it for me ? ”

69909	69919	69920	69920	she	159	“ Very well , then ; I ’ll write , ”
69985	70002	69982	69983	the Hickses	177	“ a bang - up show -- they’re really lances -- you would n’t know them ! ”
70019	70026	70012	70012	he	1860	“ as soon as things were settled ”
70028	70040	70041	70041	he	1860	“ You were dead right , were n’t you , Susy , ”
70044	70092	70093	70093	He	1860	“ that night in Venice last summer , when we all thought you were joking about their engagement ? Pity now you chucked our surprise visit to the Hickses , and sent Streff up to drag us back just as we were breaking in ! You remember ? ”
70097	70099	70093	70093	He	1860	“ Streff ”
70129	70158	70119	70120	Lord Altringham	267	“ Was Breckenridge speaking about me ? I did n’t catch what he said . Does he speak indistinctly -- or am I getting deaf , I wonder ? ”
70209	70252	70198	70198	Breckenridge	249	“ Nick dear , it was July when you left Venice , and I have had no word from you since the note in which you said you had gone for a few days , and that I should hear soon again . “
70362	70434	70435	70435	I	0	” She broke off on the last word . Hope ? What did she hope , either for him or for herself ? Wishes for his welfare would sound like a mockery -- and she would rather her letter should seem bitter than unfeeling . Above all , she wanted to get it done . To have to re - write even those few lines would be torture . So she left “
70438	70443	70435	70435	I	0	” and simply added : “
70453	70625	70435	70435	I	0	” She read it over , and shivered . Not one word of the past -- not one allusion to that mysterious interweaving of their lives which had enclosed them one in the other like the flower in its sheath ! What place had such memories in such a letter ? She had the feeling that she wanted to hide that other Nick away in her own bosom , and with him the other Susy , the Susy he had once imagined her to be .... Neither of them seemed concerned with the present business . The letter done , she stared at the sealed envelope till its presence in the room became intolerable , and she understood that she must either tear it up or post it immediately . She went down to the hall of the sleeping hotel , and bribed the night - porter to carry the letter to the nearest post office , though he objected that , at that hour , no time would be gained . “
70634	70699	70626	70626	I	0	” she insisted : and waited sternly by the desk , in her dressing - gown , till he had performed the errand . As she re - entered her room , the disordered writing - table struck her ; and she remembered the lawyer ’s injunction to take a copy of her letter . A copy to be filed away with the documents in “
70704	70799	70800	70800	Nick	170	” She burst out laughing at the idea . What were lawyers made of , she wondered ? Did n’t the man guess , by the mere look in her eyes and the sound of her voice , that she would never , as long as she lived , forget a word of that letter -- that night after night she would lie down , as she was lying down to - night , to stare wide - eyed for hours into the darkness , while a voice in her brain monotonously hammered out : “
70811	70966	70800	70800	Nick	170	” and so on , word after word , down to the last fatal syllable ? XXII . STREFFORD was leaving for England . Once assured that Susy had taken the first step toward freeing herself , he frankly regarded her as his affianced wife , and could see no reason for further mystery . She understood his impatience to have their plans settled ; it would protect him from the formidable menace of the marriageable , and cause people , as he said , to stop meddling . Now that the novelty of his situation was wearing off , his natural indolence reasserted itself , and there was nothing he dreaded more than having to be on his guard against the innumerable plans that his well - wishers were perpetually making for him . Sometimes Susy fancied he was marrying her because to do so was to follow the line of least resistance . “
70981	71010	71011	71011	I	0	” she laughed , as he stood before her one day in a quiet alley of the Bois de Boulogne , insisting on the settlement of various preliminaries . “
71021	71039	71011	71011	I	0	” An odd gleam passed behind his eyes , and she instantly guessed that he was thinking : “
71048	71060	71044	71044	I	0	” She changed colour , and he rejoined , laughing also : “
71074	71082	71071	71072	the Lord	2631	” She pondered , and then questioned : “
71099	71100	71071	71072	the Lord	2631	” “
71133	71146	71122	71122	You	0	” It was on the tip of her tongue to flash back : “
71156	71446	71122	71122	You	0	” But caring was exactly the factor she wanted , as much as possible , to keep out of their talk and their thoughts . She could not ask him how much he cared without laying herself open to the same question ; and that way terror lay . As a matter of fact , though Strefford was not an ardent wooer -- perhaps from tact , perhaps from temperament , perhaps merely from the long habit of belittling and disintegrating every sentiment and every conviction -- yet she knew he did care for her as much as he was capable of caring for anyone . If the element of habit entered largely into the feeling -- if he liked her , above all , because he was used to her , knew her views , her indulgences , her allowances , knew he was never likely to be bored , and almost certain to be amused , by her ; why , such ingredients though not of the fieriest , were perhaps those most likely to keep his feeling for her at a pleasant temperature . She had had a taste of the tropics , and wanted more equable weather ; but the idea of having to fan his flame gently for a year was unspeakably depressing to her . Yet all this was precisely what she could not say . The long period of probation , during which , as she knew , she would have to amuse him , to guard him , to hold him , and to keep off the other women , was a necessary part of their situation . She was sure that , as little Breckenridge would have said , she could “
71450	71496	71122	71122	You	0	” ; but she did not want to think about it . What she would have preferred would have been to go away -- no matter where and not see Strefford again till they were married . But she dared not tell him that either . “
71503	71507	71122	71122	You	0	” She wondered . “
71526	71527	71510	71510	I	0	” “
71532	71539	71510	71510	I	0	” He sat down beside her . “
71573	71656	71562	71562	me	0	” Still she hesitated . The alternative , she knew , would be to live on Ursula Gillow , Violet Melrose , or some other of her rich friends , any one of whom would be ready to lavish the largest hospitality on the prospective Lady Altringham . Such an arrangement , in the long run , would be no less humiliating to her pride , no less destructive to her independence , than Altringham ’s little establishment . But she temporized . “
71681	71682	71687	71687	you	1879	” “
71690	71717	71687	71687	you	1879	” He obviously considered her hesitation ridiculous , but was too full of satisfaction at her having started divorce proceedings to be chilled by her reply . “
71738	71739	71729	71729	I	0	” “
71743	71750	71729	71729	I	0	” She flushed at the suggestion . “
71768	71769	71729	71729	I	0	” “
71843	71892	71835	71835	I	0	” Ellie and Bockheimer ! How she hated the conjunction of the names ! Their case always seemed to her like a caricature of her own , and she felt an unreasoning resentment against Ellie for having selected the same season for her unmating and re - mating . “
71925	71926	71922	71923	Ellie Vanderlyn	184	” “
71942	71943	71933	71933	You	255	” “
71959	71984	71953	71953	I	0	” She shivered at the memory , and rose restlessly from the bench where they had been sitting . Strefford gave his careless shrug . “
72031	72094	72095	72095	Ellie	184	” He stopped abruptly , and looked at Susy . She was conscious that every drop of blood had left her face . She felt it ebbing away from her heart , flowing out of her as if from all her severed arteries , till it seemed as though nothing were left of life in her but one point of irreducible pain . “
72113	72118	72119	72119	You	184	” Strefford still stared . “
72128	72129	72123	72123	you	184	” “
72138	72142	72123	72123	you	184	” she insisted . “
72217	72239	72241	72241	she	1898	” he exclaimed . She returned his stare , but without seeing him . Everything swam and danced before her eyes . “
72254	72255	72241	72241	she	1898	” “
72269	72281	72282	72282	She	1898	” She pursued her thought as if he had not spoken . “
72297	72298	72282	72282	She	1898	” “
72316	72317	72318	72318	She	1898	” “
72334	72335	72332	72332	her	1898	” “
72356	72384	72332	72332	her	1898	” But Susy , still blind to everything but the dance of dizzy sparks before her eyes , pressed on as if she had not heard him . “
72405	72447	72398	72398	It	1905	” She did not know why , but this seemed to her the most humiliating incident in the whole hateful business . She remembered Nick ’s reluctance to use the motor -- she remembered his look when she had boasted of her “
72450	72463	72464	72464	I	0	” The nausea mounted to her throat . Strefford burst out laughing . “
72481	72482	72473	72473	you	0	” “
72516	72517	72518	72520	Good old Susy	159	” “
72531	72532	72528	72528	you	0	” “
72541	72545	72528	72528	you	0	” she groaned . “
72552	72553	72556	72556	your	0	” “
72563	72845	72846	72846	Susy	159	” she began impetuously ; and then stopped . How could she explain to him that what revolted her was not so much the fact of his having given the little house , as soon as she and Nick had left it , to those two people of all others -- though the vision of them in the sweet secret house , and under the plane - trees of the terrace , drew such a trail of slime across her golden hours ? No , it was not that from which she most recoiled , but from the fact that Strefford , living in luxury in Nelson Vanderlyn ’s house , should at the same time have secretly abetted Ellie Vanderlyn ’s love - affairs , and allowed her -- for a handsome price -- to shelter them under his own roof . The reproach trembled on her lip -- but she remembered her own part in the wretched business , and the impossibility of avowing it to Strefford , and of revealing to him that Nick had left her for that very reason . She was not afraid that the discovery would diminish her in Strefford ’s eyes : he was untroubled by moral problems , and would laugh away her avowal , with a sneer at Nick in his new part of moralist . But that was just what she could not bear : that anyone should cast a doubt on the genuineness of Nick ’s standards , or should know how far below them she had fallen . She remained silent , and Strefford , after a moment , drew her gently down to the seat beside him . “
72929	73160	72918	72918	One	2186	” She lifted her eyes to his puzzled incredulous face . Poor Streff ! No , it was not with him that she was angry . Why should she be ? Even that ill - advised disclosure had told her nothing she had not already known about him . It had simply revealed to her once more the real point of view of the people he and she lived among had shown her that , in spite of the superficial difference , he felt as they felt , judged as they judged , was blind as they were -- and as she would be expected to be , should she once again become one of them . What was the use of being placed by fortune above such shifts and compromises , if in one ’s heart one still condoned them ? And she would have to -- she would catch the general note , grow blunted as those other people were blunted , and gradually come to wonder at her own revolt , as Strefford now honestly wondered at it . She felt as though she were on the point of losing some new - found treasure , a treasure precious only to herself , but beside which all he offered her was nothing , the triumph of her wounded pride nothing , the security of her future nothing . “
73167	73317	73165	73165	Susy	159	” he asked , with the same puzzled gentleness . Ah , the loneliness of never being able to make him understand ! She had felt lonely enough when the flaming sword of Nick ’s indignation had shut her out from their Paradise ; but there had been a cruel bliss in the pain . Nick had not opened her eyes to new truths , but had waked in her again something which had lain unconscious under years of accumulated indifference . And that re - awakened sense had never left her since , and had somehow kept her from utter loneliness because it was a secret shared with Nick , a gift she owed to Nick , and which , in leaving her , he could not take from her . It was almost , she suddenly felt , as if he had left her with a child . “
73322	73334	73335	73335	you	1912	” Strefford said , with a resigned glance at his watch , “
73344	73460	73461	73473	the little American ” whom one had to ask when one invited him	2833	” At the Embassy ? She looked at him vaguely : then she remembered . Yes , they were dining that night at the Ascots ’ , with Strefford ’s cousin , the Duke of Dunes , and his wife , the handsome irreproachable young Duchess ; with the old gambling Dowager Duchess , whom her son and daughter - in - law had come over from England to see ; and with other English and French guests of a rank and standing worthy of the Duneses . Susy knew that her inclusion in such a dinner could mean but one thing : it was her definite recognition as Altringham ’s future wife . She was “
73464	73493	73461	73473	the little American ” whom one had to ask when one invited him	2833	” whom one had to ask when one invited him , even on ceremonial occasions . The family had accepted her ; the Embassy could but follow suit . “
73511	73517	73506	73506	someone	981	” Strefford reminded her patiently . “
73530	73544	73545	73545	I	0	” The words broke from her without her knowing what she was saying . “
73570	73581	73520	73520	Streff	198	” She lifted her eyes to his in desperate appeal . “
73590	73642	73520	73520	Streff	198	” she wailed , knowing , while she spoke , the utter impossibility of what she asked . Strefford ’s face had gradually paled and hardened . From sallow it turned to a dusky white , and lines of obstinacy deepened between the ironic eyebrows and about the weak amused mouth . “
73653	73657	73647	73647	you	198	” He laughed . “
73667	73675	73659	73659	you	198	” She shrank at the sneer of the “
73678	73711	73659	73659	you	198	” but instantly remembered that it was the only thing he could be expected to say , since it was just because he could n’t understand that she was flying from him . “
73724	73725	73714	73714	Streff	198	” “
73745	73771	73739	73739	you	198	” Her head drooped , and she saw the dead leaves whirling across the path at her feet , lifted on a sudden wintry gust . “
73775	73787	73839	73839	Streff	198	” he continued , clearing his throat with a stiff smile , “
73799	73833	73739	73739	you	198	” She stood speechless , agonized by his pain . But still , she thought , he had remembered the dinner at the Embassy . The thought gave her courage to go on . “
73855	73856	73841	73841	I	0	” “
73870	73871	73868	73868	you	198	” “
73885	73896	73897	73897	You	198	” He clicked at the leaves as they whirled past . “
73909	73940	73897	73897	You	198	” She saw that his new - born sense of his own consequence was making him suffer even more than his wounded affection ; and that again gave her courage . “
73975	73976	73967	73967	you	198	” “
73979	73983	73967	73967	you	198	” he said , “
73989	74094	73985	73985	your	198	” She looked at him helplessly , penetrated by the despairing sense of their inaccessibility to each other . Then she remembered that Nick , during their last talk together , had seemed as inaccessible , and wondered if , when human souls try to get too near each other , they do not inevitably become mere blurs to each other ’s vision . She would have liked to say this to Streff -- but he would not have understood it either . The sense of loneliness once more enveloped her , and she groped in vain for a word that should reach him . “
74105	74111	74103	74103	you	1919	” she appealed to him . “
74114	74118	73985	73985	your	198	” She nodded . “
74127	74137	73985	73985	your	198	” He tried , rather valiantly , to smile . “
74156	74173	73985	73985	your	198	” He glanced toward the taxi that awaited them at the end of the deserted drive . “
74208	74217	74218	74218	I	0	” He laid his hand on her arm . “
74229	74230	74218	74218	I	0	” “
74252	74260	74239	74239	you	0	” He released her and drew back . “
74266	74460	74239	74239	you	0	” he answered coldly ; and she understood by his tone that the knot was cut , and that at that moment he almost hated her . She turned away , hastening down the deserted alley , flying from him , and knowing , as she fled , that he was still standing there motionless , staring after her , wounded , humiliated , uncomprehending . It was neither her fault nor his .... XXIII . AS she fled on toward the lights of the streets a breath of freedom seemed to blow into her face . Like a weary load the accumulated hypocrisies of the last months had dropped from her : she was herself again , Nick ’s Susy , and no one else ’s . She sped on , staring with bright bewildered eyes at the stately facades of the La Muette quarter , the perspectives of bare trees , the awakening glitter of shop - windows holding out to her all the things she would never again be able to buy .... In an avenue of shops she paused before a milliner ’s window , and said to herself : “
74472	74506	74239	74239	you	0	” She met work - girls streaming out under a doorway , and scattering to catch trams and omnibuses ; and she looked with newly - wakened interest at their tired independent faces . “
74520	74559	74239	74239	you	0	” she thought . A little farther on she passed a Sister of Charity with softly trotting feet , a calm anonymous glance , and hands hidden in her capacious sleeves . Susy looked at her and thought : “
74587	75138	74239	74239	you	0	” All these strangers on whom she smiled in passing , and glanced back at enviously , were free from the necessities that enslaved her , and would not have known what she meant if she had told them that she must have so much money for her dresses , so much for her cigarettes , so much for bridge and cabs and tips , and all kinds of extras , and that at that moment she ought to be hurrying back to a dinner at the British Embassy , where her permanent right to such luxuries was to be solemnly recognized and ratified . The artificiality and unreality of her life overcame her as with stifling fumes . She stopped at a street - corner , drawing long panting breaths as if she had been running a race . Then , slowly and aimlessly , she began to saunter along a street of small private houses in damp gardens that led to the Avenue du Bois . She sat down on a bench . Not far off , the Arc de Triomphe raised its august bulk , and beyond it a river of lights streamed down toward Paris , and the stir of the city ’s heart - beats troubled the quiet in her bosom . But not for long . She seemed to be looking at it all from the other side of the grave ; and as she got up and wandered down the Champs Elysees , half empty in the evening lull between dusk and dinner , she felt as if the glittering avenue were really changed into the Field of Shadows from which it takes its name , and as if she were a ghost among ghosts . Halfway home , a weakness of loneliness overcame her , and she seated herself under the trees near the Rond Point . Lines of motors and carriages were beginning to animate the converging thoroughfares , streaming abreast , crossing , winding in and out of each other in a tangle of hurried pleasure - seeking . She caught the light on jewels and shirt - fronts and hard bored eyes emerging from dim billows of fur and velvet . She seemed to hear what the couples were saying to each other , she pictured the drawing - rooms , restaurants , dance - halls they were hastening to , the breathless routine that was hurrying them along , as Time , the old vacuum - cleaner , swept them away with the dust of their carriage - wheels . And again the loneliness vanished in a sense of release .... At the corner of the Place de la Concorde she stopped , recognizing a man in evening dress who was hailing a taxi . Their eyes met , and Nelson Vanderlyn came forward . He was the last person she cared to run across , and she shrank back involuntarily . What did he know , what had he guessed , of her complicity in his wife ’s affairs ? No doubt Ellie had blabbed it all out by this time ; she was just as likely to confide her love - affairs to Nelson as to anyone else , now that the Bockheimer prize was landed . “
75163	75211	75158	75158	Susy	301	” She found her hand cordially clasped in Vanderlyn ’s , and his round pink face bent on her with all its old urbanity . Did nothing matter , then , in this world she was fleeing from , did no one love or hate or remember ? “
75224	75234	75222	75222	myself	0	” Vanderlyn continued , visibly delighted at the meeting . “
75344	75370	75325	75325	I’ll	0	” As he steered her toward the carriage she noticed that he had a gouty limp , and pulled himself in after her with difficulty . “
75408	75572	75625	75625	you	301	” He seemed surprised but relieved at the suggestion , and they rolled off together . In a corner at Bauge ’s they found a quiet table , screened from the other diners , and while Vanderlyn adjusted his eyeglasses to study the carte Susy stole a long look at him . He was dressed with even more than his usual formal trimness , and she detected , in an ultra - flat wrist - watch and discreetly expensive waistcoat buttons , an attempt at smartness altogether new . His face had undergone the same change : its familiar look of worn optimism had been , as it were , done up to match his clothes , as though a sort of moral cosmetic had made him pinker , shinier and sprightlier without really rejuvenating him . A thin veil of high spirits had merely been drawn over his face , as the shining strands of hair were skilfully brushed over his baldness . “
75586	75610	75584	75584	Susy	301	” He chose , fastidiously , the best the cellar could produce , grumbling a little at the bourgeois character of the dishes . “
75663	75699	75658	75658	you	301	” He re - filled their champagne glasses , flung an arm sideways over his chair , and smiled at her with a foggy benevolence . As the champagne flowed his confidences flowed with it . “
75766	75807	75808	75808	you	1946	” Susy gazed and listened . She remembered that people had thought Nelson would make a row when he found out . He had always been addicted to truculent anecdotes about unfaithful wives , and the very formula of his perpetual ejaculation--“Caught
75812	75837	75839	75839	his	1947	eh?”--seemed to hint at a constant preoccupation with such ideas . But now it was evident that , as the saying was , he had “
75841	75899	75901	75901	you	1946	” like all the others . No strong blast of indignation had momentarily lifted him above his normal stature : he remained a little man among little men , and his eagerness to rebuild his life with all the old smiling optimism reminded Susy of the patient industry of an ant remaking its ruined ant - heap . “
76207	76236	76204	76205	Mrs. Streff	304	” She caught the hand with which he was signalling to the sommelier . This flushed and garrulous Nelson moved her more poignantly than a more heroic figure . “
76247	76252	76280	76280	George	305	” she suddenly added , “
76258	76262	76280	76280	George	305	” He stared . “
76273	76274	76271	76271	Altringham	267	” “
76277	76278	76271	76271	Altringham	267	” “
76301	76309	76291	76291	Ai	303	” She laughed and shook her head . “
76325	76326	76311	76311	you	303	” “
76354	76360	76351	76351	I	0	” He interrupted her quickly . “
76379	76391	76376	76376	people	421	” He twisted his moustache , evidently proud of his reputation . “
76476	76617	76466	76466	I	0	” His voice dropped from boastfulness to a note of wistful melancholy , the look of strained jauntiness fell from his face like a mask , and for an instant she saw the real man , old , ruined , lonely . Yes , that was it : he was lonely , desperately lonely , foundering in such deep seas of solitude that any presence out of the past was like a spar to which he clung . Whatever he knew or guessed of the part she had played in his disaster , it was not callousness that had made him greet her with such forgiving warmth , but the same sense of smallness , insignificance and isolation which perpetually hung like a cold fog on her own horizon . Suddenly she too felt old -- old and unspeakably tired . “
76635	76680	76629	76629	I	0	” He offered no objection , but asked for the bill , resumed his jaunty air while he scattered largesse among the waiters , and sauntered out behind her after calling for a taxi . They drove off in silence . Susy was thinking : “
76684	76716	76682	76682	Clarissa	187	” but dared not ask . Vanderlyn lit a cigarette , hummed a dance - tune , and stared out of the window . Suddenly she felt his hand on hers . “
76725	76726	76720	76720	you	301	” “
76731	76740	76729	76729	Ellie	184	” He nodded , without turning toward her . “
76746	76747	76749	76749	you	301	” “
76778	76787	76788	76788	I	0	” His voice broke in a little gasp . “
76811	76828	76831	76832	poor Nelson	303	” The cigarette dropped from his fingers , and with a sob he covered his face . “
76837	76887	76835	76835	Nelson	303	” Susy breathed . While their cab rattled across the Place du Carrousel , and over the bridge , he continued to sit beside her with hidden face . At last he pulled out a scented handkerchief , rubbed his eyes with it , and groped for another cigarette . “
76972	76988	76995	76995	you	1967	” he caught her by the arm as the taxi drew up at her hotel .... “
77006	77007	77008	77008	I	0	” “
77015	77056	77008	77008	I	0	” she promised ; and climbed the stairs alone to her dreary room . Susy ’s one fear was that Strefford , when he returned the next day , should treat their talk of the previous evening as a fit of “
77058	77349	77013	77013	Nelson	303	” to be jested away . He might , indeed , resent her behaviour too deeply to seek to see her at once ; but his easygoing modern attitude toward conduct and convictions made that improbable . She had an idea that what he had most minded was her dropping so unceremoniously out of the Embassy Dinner . But , after all , why should she see him again ? She had had enough of explanations during the last months to have learned how seldom they explain anything . If the other person did not understand at the first word , at the first glance even , subsequent elucidations served only to deepen the obscurity . And she wanted above all -- and especially since her hour with Nelson Vanderlyn -- to keep herself free , aloof , to retain her hold on her precariously recovered self . She sat down and wrote to Strefford -- and the letter was only a little less painful to write than the one she had despatched to Nick . It was not that her own feelings were in any like measure engaged ; but because , as the decision to give up Strefford affirmed itself , she remembered only his kindness , his forbearance , his good humour , and all the other qualities she had always liked in him ; and because she felt ashamed of the hesitations which must cause him so much pain and humiliation . Yes : humiliation chiefly . She knew that what she had to say would hurt his pride , in whatever way she framed her renunciation ; and her pen wavered , hating its task . Then she remembered Vanderlyn ’s words about his wife : “
77365	77383	77384	77384	You	1971	” and a phrase of Grace Fulmer ’s that she had but half grasped at the time : “
77406	77485	77384	77384	You	1971	” Here were two people who had penetrated farther than she into the labyrinth of the wedded state , and struggled through some of its thorniest passages ; and yet both , one consciously , the other half - unaware , testified to the mysterious fact which was already dawning on her : that the influence of a marriage begun in mutual understanding is too deep not to reassert itself even in the moment of flight and denial . “
77495	77535	77536	77536	He	301	” was what she would have said to Strefford if she had dared to set down the bare truth ; and she knew that , whatever she wrote , he was too acute not to read that into it . “
77598	77642	77643	77644	Poor Streff	198	” If she could have hoped to make Strefford understand that , the letter would have been easy enough to write -- but she knew just at what point his imagination would fail , in what obvious and superficial inferences it would rest . “
77649	78101	77643	77644	Poor Streff	198	” she thought as she sealed the letter . After she had despatched it a sense of blankness descended on her . She had succeeded in driving from her mind all vain hesitations , doubts , returns upon herself : her healthy system naturally rejected them . But they left a queer emptiness in which her thoughts rattled about as thoughts might , she supposed , in the first moments after death -- before one got used to it . To get used to being dead : that seemed to be her immediate business . And she felt such a novice at it -- felt so horribly alive ! How had those others learned to do without living ? Nelson -- well , he was still in the throes ; and probably never would understand , or be able to communicate , the lesson when he had mastered it . But Grace Fulmer -- she suddenly remembered that Grace was in Paris , and set forth to find her . XXIV . NICK LANSING had walked out a long way into the Campagna . His hours were seldom his own , for both Mr. and Mrs. Hicks were becoming more and more addicted to sudden and somewhat imperious demands upon his time ; but on this occasion he had simply slipped away after luncheon , and taking the tram to the Porta Salaria , had wandered on thence in the direction of the Ponte Nomentano . He wanted to get away and think ; but now that he had done it the business proved as unfruitful as everything he had put his hand to since he had left Venice . Think -- think about what ? His future seemed to him a negligible matter since he had received , two months earlier , the few lines in which Susy had asked him for her freedom . The letter had been a shock -- though he had fancied himself so prepared for it -- yet it had also , in another sense , been a relief , since , now that at last circumstances compelled him to write to her , they also told him what to say . And he had said it as briefly and simply as possible , telling her that he would put no obstacle in the way of her release , that he held himself at her lawyer ’s disposal to answer any further communication -- and that he would never forget their days together , or cease to bless her for them . That was all . He gave his Roman banker ’s address , and waited for another letter ; but none came . Probably the “
78104	78359	77643	77644	Poor Streff	198	” whatever they were , took longer than he had supposed ; and being in no haste to recover his own liberty , he did not try to learn the cause of the delay . From that moment , however , he considered himself virtually free , and ceased , by the same token , to take any interest in his own future . His life seemed as flat as a convalescent ’s first days after the fever has dropped . The only thing he was sure of was that he was not going to remain in the Hickses ’ employ : when they left Rome for Central Asia he had no intention of accompanying them . The part of Mr. Buttles ’ successor was becoming daily more intolerable to him , for the very reasons that had probably made it most gratifying to Mr. Buttles . To be treated by Mr. and Mrs. Hicks as a paid oracle , a paraded and petted piece of property , was a good deal more distasteful than he could have imagined any relation with these kindly people could be . And since their aspirations had become frankly social he found his task , if easier , yet far less congenial than during his first months with them . He preferred patiently explaining to Mrs. Hicks , for the hundredth time , that Sassanian and Saracenic were not interchangeable terms , to unravelling for her the genealogies of her titled guests , and reminding her , when she “
78361	78774	78778	78778	you	1973	” her dinner - parties , that Dukes ranked higher than Princes . No -- the job was decidedly intolerable ; and he would have to look out for another means of earning his living . But that was not what he had really got away to think about . He knew he should never starve ; he had even begun to believe again in his book . What he wanted to think of was Susy -- or rather , it was Susy that he could not help thinking of , on whatever train of thought he set out . Again and again he fancied he had established a truce with the past : had come to terms -- the terms of defeat and failure with that bright enemy called happiness . And , in truth , he had reached the point of definitely knowing that he could never return to the kind of life that he and Susy had embarked on . It had been the tragedy , of their relation that loving her roused in him ideals she could never satisfy . He had fallen in love with her because she was , like himself , amused , unprejudiced and disenchanted ; and he could not go on loving her unless she ceased to be all these things . From that circle there was no issue , and in it he desperately revolved . If he had not heard such persistent rumours of her re - marriage to Lord Altringham he might have tried to see her again ; but , aware of the danger and the hopelessness of a meeting , he was , on the whole , glad to have a reason for avoiding it . Such , at least , he honestly supposed to be his state of mind until he found himself , as on this occasion , free to follow out his thought to its end . That end , invariably , was Susy ; not the bundle of qualities and defects into which his critical spirit had tried to sort her out , but the soft blur of identity , of personality , of eyes , hair , mouth , laugh , tricks of speech and gesture , that were all so solely and profoundly her own , and yet so mysteriously independent of what she might do , say , think , in crucial circumstances . He remembered her once saying to him : “
78790	79232	78778	78778	you	1973	” and the indignant stare of incredulity with which he had answered her . Yet in these hours it was the palpable image of her that clung closest , till , as invariably happened , his vision came full circle , and feeling her on his breast he wanted her also in his soul . Well -- such all - encompassing loves were the rarest of human experiences ; he smiled at his presumption in wanting no other . Wearily he turned , and tramped homeward through the winter twilight .... At the door of the hotel he ran across the Prince of Teutoburg ’s aide - de - camp . They had not met for some days , and Nick had a vague feeling that if the Prince ’s matrimonial designs took definite shape he himself was not likely , after all , to be their chosen exponent . He had surprised , now and then , a certain distrustful coldness under the Princess Mother ’s cordial glance , and had concluded that she perhaps suspected him of being an obstacle to her son ’s aspirations . He had no idea of playing that part , but was not sorry to appear to ; for he was sincerely attached to Coral Hicks , and hoped for her a more human fate than that of becoming Prince Anastasius ’s consort . This evening , however , he was struck by the beaming alacrity of the aide - de - camp ’s greeting . Whatever cloud had hung between them had lifted : the Teutoburg clan , for one reason or another , no longer feared or distrusted him . The change was conveyed in a mere hand - pressure , a brief exchange of words , for the aide - de - camp was hastening after a well - known dowager of the old Roman world , whom he helped into a large coronetted brougham which looked as if it had been extracted , for some ceremonial purpose , from a museum of historic vehicles . And in an instant it flashed on Lansing that this lady had been the person chosen to lay the Prince ’s offer at Miss Hicks ’s feet . The discovery piqued him ; and instead of making straight for his own room he went up to Mrs. Hicks ’s drawing - room . The room was empty , but traces of elaborate tea pervaded it , and an immense bouquet of stiff roses lay on the centre table . As he turned away , Eldorada Tooker , flushed and tear - stained , abruptly entered . “
79245	79246	79238	79238	we	1975	” “
79251	79252	79238	79238	we	1975	” “
79276	79306	79264	79264	She	196	” She led him across the ante - chamber and down the passage to the separate suite which Miss Hicks inhabited . On the threshold Eldorada gasped out emotionally : “
79313	79409	79258	79258	she	196	” and jerked away with a sob as he entered . Coral Hicks was never lovely : but she certainly looked unusually handsome . Perhaps it was the long dress of black velvet which , outlined against a shaded lamp , made her strong build seem slenderer , or perhaps the slight flush on her dusky cheek : a bloom of womanhood hung upon her which she made no effort to dissemble . Indeed , it was one of her originalities that she always gravely and courageously revealed the utmost of whatever mood possessed her . “
79415	79436	79258	79258	she	196	” he said , smiling at her . She threw her head back and gazed him straight in the eyes . “
79446	79447	79258	79258	she	196	” “
79452	79453	79258	79258	she	196	” “
79456	79457	79258	79258	she	196	” “
79463	79464	79258	79258	she	196	” “
79470	79489	79492	79492	Coral	196	” They continued to consider each other without speaking . Nick ’s heart contracted with pity and perplexity . “
79499	79514	79492	79492	Coral	196	” She scrutinized him for a last penetrating moment ; then she looked away . “
79521	79545	79515	79515	I	0	” He hesitated , choking with contradictory impulses , and afraid to formulate any , lest they should either mislead or pain her . “
79553	79588	79549	79549	you	196	” he questioned lamely ; and instantly perceived his blunder . She sat down , and looked up at him under brooding lashes -- had he ever noticed the thickness of her lashes before ? “
79601	79602	79596	79596	I	0	” “
79606	79607	79596	79596	I	0	” “
79613	79617	79618	79618	I	0	” she commanded . “
79647	79648	79649	79649	You	0	” “
79656	79657	79649	79649	You	0	” “
79666	79692	79663	79663	I	0	” The retort frightened him with the glimpse of what she still expected of him , and what he was still so unable to give . “
79700	79708	79695	79695	you	196	” he pursued , to gain time . “
79731	79732	79728	79728	your	196	” “
79738	79739	79728	79728	your	196	” “
79744	79748	79728	79728	your	196	” She paused . “
79754	79777	79779	79779	yourself	196	” she questioned , with a sudden accent of helplessness . He looked at her as helplessly . He could not say : “
79785	79797	79782	79783	your parents	1977	” Her next word would sweep away such frail hypocrisies . Her “
79803	79805	79800	79800	I	0	” meant “
79813	79826	79808	79808	you	0	” and he knew it , and knew that she knew it . “
79839	79848	79827	79827	I	0	” he began , with a strained smile ; “
79859	79860	79850	79850	I	0	” “
79867	79872	79875	79875	people	421	” She was merciless . “
79881	79882	79884	79884	People	421	” “
79909	79913	79914	79914	I	0	” He considered . “
79931	79932	79914	79914	I	0	” “
79963	79970	79957	79957	I	0	” She drew a deep breath . “
79977	79986	79987	79987	I	0	” She appeared to search for the word . “
79994	79998	79987	79987	I	0	” she declared . “
80001	80006	80009	80009	you	2236	” She reddened swarthily . “
80309	80361	80307	80307	me	0	” She broke off with one of her clumsy smiles , and moved away from him to the other end of the room . He sat looking at her with a curious feeling of admiration . Her harsh positivism was like a tonic to his disenchanted mood , and he thought : “
80366	80371	80307	80307	me	0	” Aloud he said : “
80387	80388	80381	80381	You	0	” “
80397	80398	80390	80390	I	0	” “
80411	80417	80381	80381	You	0	” Her face flamed again . “
80423	80434	80381	80381	You	0	” He stood up involuntarily , and drew near her . “
80438	80439	80381	80381	You	0	” “
80457	80475	80443	80455	the only man with whom I can imagine the other kind of greatness	2005	” It moved him -- moved him unexpectedly . He got as far as saying to himself : “
80486	80552	80476	80477	Good God	236	” and then of yielding for a moment to the persuasive vision of all that he and she might do with those very riches which he dreaded . After all , there was nothing mean in her ideals they were hard and material , in keeping with her primitive and massive person ; but they had a certain grim nobility . And when she spoke of “
80558	80606	80476	80477	Good God	236	” he knew that she understood what she was talking of , and was not merely saying something to draw him on , to get him to commit himself . There was not a drop of guile in her , except that which her very honesty distilled . “
80613	80617	80476	80477	Good God	236	” he repeated . “
80641	80648	80624	80624	you	2007	” He went up to her . “
80670	80694	80668	80668	himself	389	” He took her hands , feeling how large , muscular and voluntary they were , even as they melted in his palms . “
80717	80731	80624	80624	you	2007	” She drew back and gave him one of her straight strong glances : “
80734	80739	80624	80624	you	2007	” she said gallantly , “
80745	81719	80624	80624	you	2007	” PART III XXV IN the persistent drizzle of a Paris winter morning Susy Lansing walked back alone from the school at which she had just deposited the four eldest Fulmers to the little house in Passy where , for the last two months , she had been living with them . She had on ready - made boots , an old waterproof and a last year ’s hat ; but none of these facts disturbed her , though she took no particular pride in them . The truth was that she was too busy to think much about them . Since she had assumed the charge of the Fulmer children , in the absence of both their parents in Italy , she had had to pass through such an arduous apprenticeship of motherhood that every moment of her waking hours was packed with things to do at once , and other things to remember to do later . There were only five Fulmers ; but at times they were like an army with banners , and their power of self - multiplication was equalled only by the manner in which they could dwindle , vanish , grow mute , and become as it were a single tumbled brown head bent over a book in some corner of the house in which nobody would ever have thought of hunting for them -- and which , of course , were it the bonne ’s room in the attic , or the subterranean closet where the trunks were kept , had been singled out by them for that very reason . These changes from ubiquity to invisibility would have seemed to Susy , a few months earlier , one of the most maddening of many characteristics not calculated to promote repose . But now she felt differently . She had grown interested in her charges , and the search for a clue to their methods , whether tribal or individual , was as exciting to her as the development of a detective story . What interested her most in the whole stirring business was the discovery that they had a method . These little creatures , pitched upward into experience on the tossing waves of their parents ’ agitated lives , had managed to establish a rough - and - ready system of self - government . Junie , the eldest ( the one who already chose her mother ’s hats , and tried to put order in her wardrobe ) was the recognized head of the state . At twelve she knew lots of things which her mother had never thoroughly learned , and Susy , her temporary mother , had never even guessed at : she spoke with authority on all vital subjects , from castor - oil to flannel under - clothes , from the fair sharing of stamps or marbles to the number of helpings of rice - pudding or jam which each child was entitled to . There was hardly any appeal from her verdict ; yet each of her subjects revolved in his or her own orbit of independence , according to laws which Junie acknowledged and respected ; and the interpreting of this mysterious charter of rights and privileges had not been without difficulty for Susy . Besides this , there were material difficulties to deal with . The six of them , and the breathless bonne who cooked and slaved for them all , had but a slim budget to live on ; and , as Junie remarked , you ’d have thought the boys ate their shoes , the way they vanished . They ate , certainly , a great deal else , and mostly of a nourishing and expensive kind . They had definite views about the amount and quality of their food , and were capable of concerted rebellion when Susy ’s catering fell beneath their standard . All this made her life a hurried and harassing business , but never -- what she had most feared it would be a dull or depressing one . It was not , she owned to herself , that the society of the Fulmer children had roused in her any abstract passion for the human young . She knew -- had known since Nick ’s first kiss -- how she would love any child of his and hers ; and she had cherished poor little Clarissa Vanderlyn with a shrinking and wistful solicitude . But in these rough young Fulmers she took a positive delight , and for reasons that were increasingly clear to her . It was because , in the first place , they were all intelligent ; and because their intelligence had been fed only on things worth caring for . However inadequate Grace Fulmer ’s bringing - up of her increasing tribe had been , they had heard in her company nothing trivial or dull : good music , good books and good talk had been their daily food , and if at times they stamped and roared and crashed about like children unblessed by such privileges , at others they shone with the light of poetry and spoke with the voice of wisdom . That had been Susy ’s discovery : for the first time she was among awakening minds which had been wakened only to beauty . From their cramped and uncomfortable household Grace and Nat Fulmer had managed to keep out mean envies , vulgar admirations , shabby discontents ; above all the din and confusion the great images of beauty had brooded , like those ancestral figures that stood apart on their shelf in the poorest Roman households . No , the task she had undertaken for want of a better gave Susy no sense of a missed vocation : “
81721	81894	80624	80624	you	2007	” on a large scale would never , she perceived , be her job . Rather it gave her , in odd ways , the sense of being herself mothered , of taking her first steps in the life of immaterial values which had begun to seem so much more substantial than any she had known . On the day when she had gone to Grace Fulmer for counsel and comfort she had little guessed that they would come to her in this form . She had found her friend , more than ever distracted and yet buoyant , riding the large untidy waves of her life with the splashed ease of an amphibian . Grace was probably the only person among Susy ’s friends who could have understood why she could not make up her mind to marry Altringham ; but at the moment Grace was too much absorbed in her own problems to pay much attention to her friend ’s , and , according to her wo nt , she immediately “
81896	82119	80624	80624	you	2007	” her difficulties . Nat was not getting what she had hoped out of his European opportunity . Oh , she was enough of an artist herself to know that there must be fallow periods -- that the impact of new impressions seldom produced immediate results . She had allowed for all that . But her past experience of Nat ’s moods had taught her to know just when he was assimilating , when impressions were fructifying in him . And now they were not , and he knew it as well as she did . There had been too much rushing about , too much excitement and sterile flattery ... Mrs. Melrose ? Well , yes , for a while ... the trip to Spain had been a love - journey , no doubt . Grace spoke calmly , but the lines of her face sharpened : she had suffered , oh horribly , at his going to Spain without her . Yet she could n’t , for the children ’s sake , afford to miss the big sum that Ursula Gillow had given her for her fortnight at Ruan . And her playing had struck people , and led , on the way back , to two or three profitable engagements in private houses in London . Fashionable society had made “
82123	82145	82146	82146	He	2010	” about her , and it had surprised and pleased Nat , and given her a new importance in his eyes . “
82260	82268	82255	82255	I	0	” Her worn cheek flushed with triumph . “
82299	82370	82289	82289	Junie	258	” Thereupon she had unfolded her idea . If Susy was at a loose end , and hard up , why should n’t she take charge of the children while their parents were in Italy ? For three months at most -- Grace could promise it should n’t be longer . They could n’t pay her much , of course , but at least she would be lodged and fed . “
82388	82584	82383	82383	I’m	2016	” the mother concluded , her irrepressible hopefulness rising even to this height , while Susy stood before her with a hesitating smile . Take care of five Fulmers for three months ! The prospect cowed her . If there had been only Junie and Geordie , the oldest and youngest of the band , she might have felt less hesitation . But there was Nat , the second in age , whose motor - horn had driven her and Nick out to the hill - side on their fatal day at the Fulmers ’ and there were the twins , Jack and Peggy , of whom she had kept memories almost equally disquieting . To rule this uproarious tribe would be a sterner business than trying to beguile Clarissa Vanderlyn ’s ladylike leisure ; and she would have refused on the spot , as she had refused once before , if the only possible alternatives had not come to seem so much less bearable , and if Junie , called in for advice , and standing there , small , plain and competent , had not said in her quiet grown - up voice : “
82610	82671	82605	82605	she	2019	” Reads aloud well ! The stipulation had enchanted Susy . She had never before known children who cared to be read aloud to ; she remembered with a shiver her attempts to interest Clarissa in anything but gossip and the fashions , and the tone in which the child had said , showing Strefford ’s trinket to her father : “
82684	82713	82673	82673	I	0	” And here were children who consented to be left for three months by their parents , but on condition that a good reader was provided for them ! “
82731	82751	82723	82723	I	0	” she had gaily questioned ; and Junie had answered , after one of her sober pauses of reflection : “
82790	82791	82794	82794	I	0	” “
82802	83237	82796	82796	I	0	” Susy murmured , stricken with self - distrust and humility . Apparently she did ; for her reading was a success , and even the twins and Geordie , once they had grown used to her , seemed to prefer a ringing page of Henry V , or the fairy scenes from the Midsummer Night ’s Dream , to their own more specialized literature , though that had also at times to be provided . There were , in fact , no lulls in her life with the Fulmers ; but its commotions seemed to Susy less meaningless , and therefore less fatiguing , than those that punctuated the existence of people like Altringham , Ursula Gillow , Ellie Vanderlyn and their train ; and the noisy uncomfortable little house at Passy was beginning to greet her with the eyes of home when she returned there after her tramps to and from the children ’s classes . At any rate she had the sense of doing something useful and even necessary , and of earning her own keep , though on so modest a scale ; and when the children were in their quiet mood , and demanded books or music ( or , even , on one occasion , at the surprising Junie ’s instigation , a collective visit to the Louvre , where they recognized the most unlikely pictures , and the two elders emitted startling technical judgments , and called their companion ’s attention to details she had not observed ) ; on these occasions , Susy had a surprised sense of being drawn back into her brief life with Nick , or even still farther and deeper , into those visions of Nick ’s own childhood on which the trivial later years had heaped their dust . It was curious to think that if he and she had remained together , and she had had a child -- the vision used to come to her , in her sleepless hours , when she looked at little Geordie , in his cot by her bed -- their life together might have been very much like the life she was now leading , a small obscure business to the outer world , but to themselves how wide and deep and crowded ! She could not bear , at that moment , the thought of giving up this mystic relation to the life she had missed . In spite of the hurry and fatigue of her days , the shabbiness and discomfort of everything , and the hours when the children were as “
83239	83418	82794	82794	I	0	” as any other children , and turned a conspiracy of hostile faces to all her appeals ; in spite of all this she did not want to give them up , and had decided , when their parents returned , to ask to go back to America with them . Perhaps , if Nat ’s success continued , and Grace was able to work at her music , they would need a kind of governess - companion . At any rate , she could picture no future less distasteful . She had not sent to Mr. Spearman Nick ’s answer to her letter . In the interval between writing to him and receiving his reply she had broken with Strefford ; she had therefore no object in seeking her freedom . If Nick wanted his , he knew he had only to ask for it ; and his silence , as the weeks passed , woke a faint hope in her . The hope flamed high when she read one day in the newspapers a vague but evidently “
83420	83470	82796	82796	I	0	” allusion to the possibility of an alliance between his Serene Highness the reigning Prince of Teutoburg - Waldhain and Miss Coral Hicks of Apex City ; it sank to ashes when , a few days later , her eye lit on a paragraph wherein Mr. and Mrs. Mortimer Hicks “
83474	83651	82794	82794	I	0	” that there was no truth in the report . On the foundation of these two statements Susy raised one watch - tower of hope after another , feverish edifices demolished or rebuilt by every chance hint from the outer world wherein Nick ’s name figured with the Hickses ’ . And still , as the days passed and she heard nothing , either from him or from her lawyer , her flag continued to fly from the quaking structures . Apart from the custody of the children there was indeed little to distract her mind from these persistent broodings . She winced sometimes at the thought of the ease with which her fashionable friends had let her drop out of sight . In the perpetual purposeless rush of their days , the feverish making of winter plans , hurrying off to the Riviera or St. Moritz , Egypt or New York , there was no time to hunt up the vanished or to wait for the laggard . Had they learned that she had broken her “
83653	84053	82794	82794	I	0	” ( how she hated the word ! ) to Strefford , and had the fact gone about that she was once more only a poor hanger - on , to be taken up when it was convenient , and ignored in the intervals ? She did not know ; though she fancied Strefford ’s newly - developed pride would prevent his revealing to any one what had passed between them . For several days after her abrupt flight he had made no sign ; and though she longed to write and ask his forgiveness she could not find the words . Finally it was he who wrote : a short note , from Altringham , typical of all that was best in the old Strefford . He had gone down to Altringham , he told her , to think quietly over their last talk , and try to understand what she had been driving at . He had to own that he could n’t ; but that , he supposed , was the very head and front of his offending . Whatever he had done to displease her , he was sorry for ; but he asked , in view of his invincible ignorance , to be allowed not to regard his offence as a cause for a final break . The possibility of that , he found , would make him even more unhappy than he had foreseen ; as she knew , his own happiness had always been his first object in life , and he therefore begged her to suspend her decision a little longer . He expected to be in Paris within another two months , and before arriving he would write again , and ask her to see him . The letter moved her but did not make her waver . She simply wrote that she was touched by his kindness , and would willingly see him if he came to Paris later ; though she was bound to tell him that she had not yet changed her mind , and did not believe it would promote his happiness to have her try to do so . He did not reply to this , and there was nothing further to keep her thoughts from revolving endlessly about her inmost hopes and fears . On the rainy afternoon in question , tramping home from the “
84055	84199	84204	84204	he	2023	” ( to which she was to return at six ) , she had said to herself that it was two months that very day since Nick had known she was ready to release him -- and that after such a delay he was not likely to take any further steps . The thought filled her with a vague ecstasy . She had had to fix an arbitrary date as the term of her anguish , and she had fixed that one ; and behold she was justified . For what could his silence mean but that he too .... On the hall - table lay a typed envelope with the Paris postage - mark . She opened it carelessly , and saw that the letter - head bore Mr. Spearman ’s office address . The words beneath spun round before her eyes .... “
84226	84900	84903	84904	that child	2026	” Nick -- it was Nick the words were talking of ! It was the fact of Nick ’s return to Paris that was being described in those preposterous terms ! She sank down on the bench beside the dripping umbrella - stand and stared vacantly before her . It had fallen at last -- this blow in which she now saw that she had never really believed ! And yet she had imagined she was prepared for it , had expected it , was already planning her future life in view of it -- an effaced impersonal life in the service of somebody else ’s children -- when , in reality , under that thin surface of abnegation and acceptance , all the old hopes had been smouldering red - hot in their ashes ! What was the use of any self - discipline , any philosophy , any experience , if the lawless self underneath could in an instant consume them like tinder ? She tried to collect herself -- to understand what had happened . Nick was coming to Paris -- coming not to see her but to consult his lawyer ! It meant , of course , that he had definitely resolved to claim his freedom ; and that , if he had made up his mind to this final step , after more than six months of inaction and seeming indifference , it could be only because something unforeseen and decisive had happened to him . Feverishly , she put together again the stray scraps of gossip and the newspaper paragraphs that had reached her in the last months . It was evident that Miss Hicks ’s projected marriage with the Prince of Teutoburg - Waldhain had been broken off at the last moment ; and broken off because she intended to marry Nick . The announcement of his arrival in Paris and the publication of Mr. and Mrs. Hicks ’s formal denial of their daughter ’s betrothal coincided too closely to admit of any other inference . Susy tried to grasp the reality of these assembled facts , to picture to herself their actual tangible results . She thought of Coral Hicks bearing the name of Mrs. Nick Lansing -- her name , Susy ’s own!--and entering drawing - rooms with Nick in her wake , gaily welcomed by the very people who , a few months before , had welcomed Susy with the same warmth . In spite of Nick ’s growing dislike of society , and Coral ’s attitude of intellectual superiority , their wealth would fatally draw them back into the world to which Nick was attached by all his habits and associations . And no doubt it would amuse him to re - enter that world as a dispenser of hospitality , to play the part of host where he had so long been a guest ; just as Susy had once fancied it would amuse her to re - enter it as Lady Altringham .... But , try as she would , now that the reality was so close on her , she could not visualize it or relate it to herself . The mere juxtaposition of the two names -- Coral , Nick -- which in old times she had so often laughingly coupled , now produced a blur in her brain . She continued to sit helplessly beside the hall - table , the tears running down her cheeks . The appearance of the bonne aroused her . Her youngest charge , Geordie , had been feverish for a day or two ; he was better , but still confined to the nursery , and he had heard Susy unlock the house - door , and could not imagine why she had not come straight up to him . He now began to manifest his indignation in a series of racking howls , and Susy , shaken out of her trance , dropped her cloak and umbrella and hurried up . “
84906	85062	84903	84904	that child	2026	” she groaned . Under the Fulmer roof there was little time or space for the indulgence of private sorrows . From morning till night there was always some immediate practical demand on one ’s attention ; and Susy was beginning to see how , in contracted households , children may play a part less romantic but not less useful than that assigned to them in fiction , through the mere fact of giving their parents no leisure to dwell on irremediable grievances . Though her own apprenticeship to family life had been so short , she had already acquired the knack of rapid mental readjustment , and as she hurried up to the nursery her private cares were dispelled by a dozen problems of temperature , diet and medicine . Such readjustment was of course only momentary ; yet each time it happened it seemed to give her more firmness and flexibility of temper . “
85073	85147	84903	84904	that child	2026	” she thought , wondering that Nick ’s influence , and the tragedy of their parting , should have done less to mature and steady her than these few weeks in a house full of children . Pacifying Geordie was not easy , for he had long since learned to use his grievances as a pretext for keeping the offender at his beck with a continuous supply of stories , songs and games . “
85163	85174	85156	85156	yourself	0	” the astute Junie had warned Susy at the outset , “
85207	85311	85193	85193	you	0	” But on this occasion , as soon as he saw her , Geordie ’s indignation melted . She was still in the doorway , compunctious , abject and racking her dazed brain for his favourite stories , when she saw , by the smoothing out of his mouth and the sudden serenity of his eyes , that he was going to give her the delicious but not wholly reassuring shock of being a good boy . Thoughtfully he examined her face as she knelt down beside the cot ; then he poked out a finger and pressed it on her tearful cheek . “
85319	85340	85312	85313	Poor Susy	159	” he said , putting his arms about her ; and as she hugged him close , he added philosophically : “
85357	86079	85342	85342	Geordie	305	” XXVI . NICK Lansing arrived in Paris two days after his lawyer had announced his coming to Mr. Spearman . He had left Rome with the definite purpose of freeing himself and Susy ; and though he was not pledged to Coral Hicks he had not concealed from her the object of his journey . In vain had he tried to rouse in himself any sense of interest in his own future . Beyond the need of reaching a definite point in his relation to Susy his imagination could not travel . But he had been moved by Coral ’s confession , and his reason told him that he and she would probably be happy together , with the temperate happiness based on a community of tastes and an enlargement of opportunities . He meant , on his return to Rome , to ask her to marry him ; and he knew that she knew it . Indeed , if he had not spoken before leaving it was with no idea of evading his fate , or keeping her longer in suspense , but simply because of the strange apathy that had fallen on him since he had received Susy ’s letter . In his incessant self - communings he dressed up this apathy as a discretion which forbade his engaging Coral ’s future till his own was assured . But in truth he knew that Coral ’s future was already engaged , and his with it : in Rome the fact had seemed natural and even inevitable . In Paris , it instantly became the thinnest of unrealities . Not because Paris was not Rome , nor because it was Paris ; but because hidden away somewhere in that vast unheeding labyrinth was the half - forgotten part of himself that was Susy .... For weeks , for months past , his mind had been saturated with Susy : she had never seemed more insistently near him than as their separation lengthened , and the chance of reunion became less probable . It was as if a sickness long smouldering in him had broken out and become acute , enveloping him in the Nessus - shirt of his memories . There were moments when , to his memory , their actual embraces seemed perfunctory , accidental , compared with this deep deliberate imprint of her soul on his . Yet now it had become suddenly different . Now that he was in the same place with her , and might at any moment run across her , meet her eyes , hear her voice , avoid her hand -- now that penetrating ghost of her with which he had been living was sucked back into the shadows , and he seemed , for the first time since their parting , to be again in her actual presence . He woke to the fact on the morning of his arrival , staring down from his hotel window on a street she would perhaps walk through that very day , and over a limitless huddle of roofs , one of which covered her at that hour . The abruptness of the transition startled him ; he had not known that her mere geographical nearness would take him by the throat in that way . What would it be , then , if she were to walk into the room ? Thank heaven that need never happen ! He was sufficiently informed as to French divorce proceedings to know that they would not necessitate a confrontation with his wife ; and with ordinary luck , and some precautions , he might escape even a distant glimpse of her . He did not mean to remain in Paris more than a few days ; and during that time it would be easy -- knowing , as he did , her tastes and Altringham’s -- to avoid the places where she was likely to be met . He did not know where she was living , but imagined her to be staying with Mrs. Melrose , or some other rich friend , or else lodged , in prospective affluence , at the Nouveau Luxe , or in a pretty flat of her own . Trust Susy -- ah , the pang of it -- to “
86081	86268	85312	85313	Poor Susy	159	” ! His first visit was to his lawyer ’s ; and as he walked through the familiar streets each approaching face , each distant figure seemed hers . The obsession was intolerable . It would not last , of course ; but meanwhile he had the exposed sense of a fugitive in a nightmare , who feels himself the only creature visible in a ghostly and besetting multitude . The eye of the metropolis seemed fixed on him in an immense unblinking stare . At the lawyer ’s he was told that , as a first step to freedom , he must secure a domicile in Paris . He had of course known of this necessity : he had seen too many friends through the Divorce Court , in one country or another , not to be fairly familiar with the procedure . But the fact presented a different aspect as soon as he tried to relate it to himself and Susy : it was as though Susy ’s personality were a medium through which events still took on a transfiguring colour . He found the “
86270	86412	85312	85313	Poor Susy	159	” that very day : a tawdrily furnished rez - de - chaussee , obviously destined to far different uses . And as he sat there , after the concierge had discreetly withdrawn with the first quarter ’s payment in her pocket , and stared about him at the vulgar plushy place , he burst out laughing at what it was about to figure in the eyes of the law : a Home , and a Home desecrated by his own act ! The Home in which he and Susy had reared their precarious bliss , and seen it crumble at the brutal touch of his unfaithfulness and his cruelty -- for he had been told that he must be cruel to her as well as unfaithful ! He looked at the walls hung with sentimental photogravures , at the shiny bronze “
86415	87290	85312	85313	Poor Susy	159	” the moth - eaten animal - skins and the bedizened bed -- and once more the unreality , the impossibility , of all that was happening to him entered like a drug into his veins . To rouse himself he stood up , turned the key on the hideous place , and returned to his lawyer ’s . He knew that in the hard dry atmosphere of the office the act of giving the address of the flat would restore some kind of reality to the phantasmal transaction . And with wonder he watched the lawyer , as a matter of course , pencil the street and the number on one of the papers enclosed in a folder on which his own name was elaborately engrossed . As he took leave it occurred to him to ask where Susy was living . At least he imagined that it had just occurred to him , and that he was making the enquiry merely as a measure of precaution , in order to know what quarter of Paris to avoid ; but in reality the question had been on his lips since he had first entered the office , and lurking in his mind since he had emerged from the railway station that morning . The fact of not knowing where she lived made the whole of Paris a meaningless unintelligible place , as useless to him as the face of a huge clock that has lost its hour hand . The address in Passy surprised him : he had imagined that she would be somewhere in the neighborhood of the Champs Elysees or the Place de l’Etoile . But probably either Mrs. Melrose or Ellie Vanderlyn had taken a house at Passy . Well -- it was something of a relief to know that she was so far off . No business called him to that almost suburban region beyond the Trocadero , and there was much less chance of meeting her than if she had been in the centre of Paris . All day he wandered , avoiding the fashionable quarters , the streets in which private motors glittered five deep , and furred and feathered silhouettes glided from them into tea - rooms , picture - galleries and jewellers ’ shops . In some such scenes Susy was no doubt figuring : slenderer , finer , vivider , than the other images of clay , but imitating their gestures , chattering their jargon , winding her hand among the same pearls and sables . He struck away across the Seine , along the quays to the Cite , the net - work of old Paris , the great grey vaults of St. Eustache , the swarming streets of the Marais . He gazed at monuments dawdled before shop - windows , sat in squares and on quays , watching people bargain , argue , philander , quarrel , work - girls stroll past in linked bands , beggars whine on the bridges , derelicts doze in the pale winter sun , mothers in mourning hasten by taking children to school , and street - walkers beat their weary rounds before the cafes . The day drifted on . Toward evening he began to grow afraid of his solitude , and to think of dining at the Nouveau Luxe , or some other fashionable restaurant where he would be fairly sure to meet acquaintances , and be carried off to a theatre , a boite or a dancing - hall . Anything , anything now , to get away from the maddening round of his thoughts . He felt the same blank fear of solitude as months ago in Genoa .... Even if he were to run across Susy and Altringham , what of it ? Better get the job over . People had long since ceased to take on tragedy airs about divorce : dividing couples dined together to the last , and met afterward in each other ’s houses , happy in the consciousness that their respective remarriages had provided two new centres of entertainment . Yet most of the couples who took their re - matings so philosophically had doubtless had their hour of enchantment , of belief in the immortality of loving ; whereas he and Susy had simply and frankly entered into a business contract for their mutual advantage . The fact gave the last touch of incongruity to his agonies and exaltations , and made him appear to himself as grotesque and superannuated as the hero of a romantic novel . He stood up from a bench on which he had been lounging in the Luxembourg gardens , and hailed a taxi . Dusk had fallen , and he meant to go back to his hotel , take a rest , and then go out to dine . But instead , he threw Susy ’s address to the driver , and settled down in the cab , resting both hands on the knob of his umbrella and staring straight ahead of him as if he were accomplishing some tiresome duty that had to be got through with before he could turn his mind to more important things . “
87297	88013	85312	85313	Poor Susy	159	” he heard himself say . At the street - corner -- her street - corner -- he stopped the cab , and stood motionless while it rattled away . It was a short vague street , much farther off than he had expected , and fading away at the farther end in a dusky blur of hoardings overhung by trees . A thin rain was beginning to fall , and it was already night in this inadequately lit suburban quarter . Lansing walked down the empty street . The houses stood a few yards apart , with bare - twigged shrubs between , and gates and railings dividing them from the pavement . He could not , at first , distinguish their numbers ; but presently , coming abreast of a street - lamp , he discovered that the small shabby facade it illuminated was precisely the one he sought . The discovery surprised him . He had imagined that , as frequently happened in the outlying quarters of Passy and La Muette , the mean street would lead to a stately private hotel , built upon some bowery fragment of an old country - place . It was the latest whim of the wealthy to establish themselves on these outskirts of Paris , where there was still space for verdure ; and he had pictured Susy behind some pillared house - front , with lights pouring across glossy turf to sculptured gateposts . Instead , he saw a six - windowed house , huddled among neighbours of its kind , with the family wash fluttering between meagre bushes . The arc - light beat ironically on its front , which had the worn look of a tired work - woman ’s face ; and Lansing , as he leaned against the opposite railing , vainly tried to fit his vision of Susy into so humble a setting . The probable explanation was that his lawyer had given him the wrong address ; not only the wrong number but the wrong street . He pulled out the slip of paper , and was crossing over to decipher it under the lamp , when an errand - boy appeared out of the obscurity , and approached the house . Nick drew back , and the boy , unlatching the gate , ran up the steps and gave the bell a pull . Almost immediately the door opened ; and there stood Susy , the light full upon her , and upon a red - checked child against her shoulder . The space behind them was dark , or so dimly lit that it formed a black background to her vivid figure . She looked at the errand - boy without surprise , took his parcel , and after he had turned away , lingered a moment in the door , glancing down the empty street . That moment , to her watcher , seemed quicker than a flash yet as long as a life - time . There she was , a stone ’s throw away , but utterly unconscious of his presence : his Susy , the old Susy , and yet a new Susy , curiously transformed , transfigured almost , by the new attitude in which he beheld her . In the first shock of the vision he forgot his surprise at her being in such a place , forgot to wonder whose house she was in , or whose was the sleepy child in her arms . For an instant she stood out from the blackness behind her , and through the veil of the winter night , a thing apart , an unconditioned vision , the eternal image of the woman and the child ; and in that instant everything within him was changed and renewed . His eyes were still absorbing her , finding again the familiar curves of her light body , noting the thinness of the lifted arm that upheld the little boy , the droop of the shoulder he weighed on , the brooding way in which her cheek leaned to his even while she looked away ; then she drew back , the door closed , and the street - lamp again shone on blankness . “
88019	88196	88017	88017	mine	2030	” Nick cried , in a fierce triumph of recovery ... His eyes were so full of her that he shut them to hold in the crowding vision . It remained with him , at first , as a complete picture ; then gradually it broke up into its component parts , the child vanished , the strange house vanished , and Susy alone stood before him , his own Susy , only his Susy , yet changed , worn , tempered -- older , even -- with sharper shadows under the cheek - bones , the brows drawn , the joint of the slim wrist more prominent . It was not thus that his memory had evoked her , and he recalled , with a remorseful pang , the fact that something in her look , her dress , her tired and drooping attitude , suggested poverty , dependence , seemed to make her after all a part of the shabby house in which , at first sight , her presence had seemed so incongruous . “
88202	88328	88017	88017	mine	2030	” he thought , his heart tightening . And instantly it occurred to him that these must be the Fulmer children whom she was living with while their parents travelled in Italy . Rumours of Nat Fulmer ’s sudden ascension had reached him , and he had heard that the couple had lately been seen in Naples and Palermo . No one had mentioned Susy ’s name in connection with them , and he could hardly tell why he had arrived at this conclusion , except perhaps because it seemed natural that , if Susy were in trouble , she should turn to her old friend Grace . But why in trouble ? What trouble ? What could have happened to check her triumphant career ? “
88338	88936	88332	88332	I	0	” he exclaimed . His heart was beating with a tumult of new hopes and old memories . The sight of his wife , so remote in mien and manner from the world in which he had imagined her to be re - absorbed , changed in a flash his own relation to life , and flung a mist of unreality over all that he had been trying to think most solid and tangible . Nothing now was substantial to him but the stones of the street in which he stood , the front of the house which hid her , the bell - handle he already felt in his grasp . He started forward , and was halfway to the threshold when a private motor turned the corner , the twin glitter of its lamps carpeting the wet street with gold to Susy ’s door . Lansing drew back into the shadow as the motor swept up to the house . A man jumped out , and the light fell on Strefford ’s shambling figure , its lazy disjointed movements so unmistakably the same under his fur coat , and in the new setting of prosperity . Lansing stood motionless , staring at the door . Strefford rang , and waited . Would Susy appear again ? Perhaps she had done so before only because she had been on the watch .... But no : after a slight delay a bonne appeared -- the breathless maid - of - all - work of a busy household -- and at once effaced herself , letting the visitor in . Lansing was sure that not a word passed between the two , of enquiry on Lord Altringham ’s part , or of acquiescence on the servant ’s . There could be no doubt that he was expected . The door closed on him , and a light appeared behind the blind of the adjoining window . The maid had shown the visitor into the sitting - room and lit the lamp . Upstairs , meanwhile , Susy was no doubt running skilful fingers through her tumbled hair and daubing her pale lips with red . Ah , how Lansing knew every movement of that familiar rite , even to the pucker of the brow and the pouting thrust - out of the lower lip ! He was seized with a sense of physical sickness as the succession of remembered gestures pressed upon his eyes .... And the other man ? The other man , inside the house , was perhaps at that very instant smiling over the remembrance of the same scene ! At the thought , Lansing plunged away into the night . XXVII . SUSY and Lord Altringham sat in the little drawing - room , divided from each other by a table carrying a smoky lamp and heaped with tattered school - books . In another half hour the bonne , despatched to fetch the children from their classes , would be back with her flock ; and at any moment Geordie ’s imperious cries might summon his slave up to the nursery . In the scant time allotted them , the two sat , and visibly wondered what to say . Strefford , on entering , had glanced about the dreary room , with its piano laden with tattered music , the children ’s toys littering the lame sofa , the bunches of dyed grass and impaled butterflies flanking the cast - bronze clock . Then he had turned to Susy and asked simply : “
88944	89053	88332	88332	I	0	” She had not tried to explain ; from the first , she had understood the impossibility of doing so . And she would not betray her secret longing to return to Nick , now that she knew that Nick had taken definite steps for his release . In dread lest Strefford should have heard of this , and should announce it to her , coupling it with the news of Nick ’s projected marriage , and lest , hearing her fears thus substantiated , she should lose her self - control , she had preferred to say , in a voice that she tried to make indifferent : “
89088	89100	89137	89137	I	0	” Strefford , at that , had looked at her keenly . “
89103	89118	89137	89137	I	0	” he murmured ; and his lips were twisted into their old mocking smile . “
89123	89129	89137	89137	I	0	” he went on carelessly , “
89158	89186	89140	89140	I	0	” The blood rushed to Susy ’s forehead . She remembered her tragic evening with Nelson Vanderlyn , only two months earlier , and thought to herself . “
89199	89204	89205	89205	I	0	” Aloud she said : “
89231	89237	89238	89238	My	0	” Strefford continued to smile . “
89352	89466	89467	89467	You	2045	” Susy looked at Strefford , conscious that under his words was the ache of the disappointment she had caused him ; and yet conscious also that that very ache was not the overwhelming penetrating emotion he perhaps wished it to be , but a pang on a par with a dozen others ; and that even while he felt it he foresaw the day when he should cease to feel it . And she thought to herself that this certainty of oblivion must be bitterer than any certainty of pain . A silence had fallen between them . He broke it by rising from his seat , and saying with a shrug : “
89478	89482	89467	89467	You	2045	” Susy smiled . “
89492	89493	89488	89488	She	284	” “
89502	89503	89497	89497	she	284	” “
89510	89511	89509	89509	I--	0	” “
89519	89524	89497	89497	she	284	” He grinned sardonically . “
89531	89541	89497	89497	she	284	” He appeared to wait for her to speak . “
89553	89563	89548	89548	you	2045	” he concluded , as she still remained silent . “
89579	89585	89568	89568	I	0	” she murmured at length . “
89596	89655	89592	89592	your	198	” Her lips made a movement of denial , and still in silence she held out her hand for good - bye . He clasped it , and then turned away ; but on the threshold he paused , his screwed - up eyes fixed on her wistfully . The look moved her , and she added hurriedly : “
89680	89681	89672	89672	I	0	” “
89699	89700	89691	89691	his	170	” “
89720	89740	89710	89710	I	0	” He still scrutinized her hesitatingly , with the gravest eyes she had ever seen in his careless face . “
89754	90090	89749	89749	I	0	” he said simply as he turned to go . That evening after the children had gone to bed Susy sat up late in the cheerless sitting - room . She was not thinking of Strefford but of Nick . He was coming to Paris -- perhaps he had already arrived . The idea that he might be in the same place with her at that very moment , and without her knowing it , was so strange and painful that she felt a violent revolt of all her strong and joy - loving youth . Why should she go on suffering so unbearably , so abjectly , so miserably ? If only she could see him , hear his voice , even hear him say again such cruel and humiliating words as he had spoken on that dreadful day in Venice when that would be better than this blankness , this utter and final exclusion from his life ! He had been cruel to her , unimaginably cruel : hard , arrogant , unjust ; and had been so , perhaps , deliberately , because he already wanted to be free . But she was ready to face even that possibility , to humble herself still farther than he had humbled her -- she was ready to do anything , if only she might see him once again . She leaned her aching head on her hands and pondered . Do anything ? But what could she do ? Nothing that should hurt him , interfere with his liberty , be false to the spirit of their pact : on that she was more than ever resolved . She had made a bargain , and she meant to stick to it , not for any abstract reason , but simply because she happened to love him in that way . Yes -- but to see him again , only once ! Suddenly she remembered what Strefford had said about Nelson Vanderlyn and his wife . “
90113	90176	89749	89749	I	0	” If in offering Nick his freedom she had indeed done him such a service as that , perhaps he no longer hated her , would no longer be unwilling to see her .... At any rate , why should she not write to him on that assumption , write in a spirit of simple friendliness , suggesting that they should meet and “
90179	90186	89749	89749	I	0	” ? The business - like word “
90188	90459	89749	89749	I	0	” ( how she hated it ) would prove to him that she had no secret designs upon his liberty ; and besides he was too unprejudiced , too modern , too free from what Strefford called humbug , not to understand and accept such a suggestion . After all , perhaps Strefford was right ; it was something to have rid human relations of hypocrisy , even if , in the process , so many exquisite things seemed somehow to have been torn away with it .... She ran up to her room , scribbled a note , and hurried with it through the rain and darkness to the post - box at the corner . As she returned through the empty street she had an odd feeling that it was not empty -- that perhaps Nick was already there , somewhere near her in the night , about to follow her to the door , enter the house , go up with her to her bedroom in the old way . It was strange how close he had been brought by the mere fact of her having written that little note to him ! In the bedroom , Geordie lay in his crib in ruddy slumber , and she blew out the candle and undressed softly for fear of waking him . Nick Lansing , the next day , received Susy ’s letter , transmitted to his hotel from the lawyer ’s office . He read it carefully , two or three times over , weighing and scrutinizing the guarded words . She proposed that they should meet to “
90463	90519	89749	89749	I	0	” What things ? And why should he accede to such a request ? What secret purpose had prompted her ? It was horrible that nowadays , in thinking of Susy , he should always suspect ulterior motives , be meanly on the watch for some hidden tortuousness . What on earth was she trying to “
90521	90832	90853	90853	she	2050	” now , he wondered . A few hours ago , at the sight of her , all his hardness had melted , and he had charged himself with cruelty , with injustice , with every sin of pride against himself and her ; but the appearance of Strefford , arriving at that late hour , and so evidently expected and welcomed , had driven back the rising tide of tenderness . Yet , after all , what was there to wonder at ? Nothing was changed in their respective situations . He had left his wife , deliberately , and for reasons which no subsequent experience had caused him to modify . She had apparently acquiesced in his decision , and had utilized it , as she was justified in doing , to assure her own future . In all this , what was there to wail or knock the breast between two people who prided themselves on looking facts in the face , and making their grim best of them , without vain repinings ? He had been right in thinking their marriage an act of madness . Her charms had overruled his judgment , and they had had their year ... their mad year ... or at least all but two or three months of it . But his first intuition had been right ; and now they must both pay for their madness . The Fates seldom forget the bargains made with them , or fail to ask for compound interest . Why not , then , now that the time had come , pay up gallantly , and remember of the episode only what had made it seem so supremely worth the cost ? He sent a pneumatic telegram to Mrs. Nicholas Lansing to say that he would call on her that afternoon at four . “
90840	90845	90853	90853	she	2050	” he reflected drily , “
90865	90876	90853	90853	she	2050	” XXVIII . HER husband ’s note had briefly said : “
90885	90924	90925	90925	Susy	159	” All day she pored over the words in an agony of longing , trying to read into them regret , emotion , memories , some echo of the tumult in her own bosom . But she had signed “
90927	90931	90925	90925	Susy	159	” and he signed “
90933	91175	91176	91176	You	2051	” That seemed to put an abyss between them . After all , she was free and he was not . Perhaps , in view of his situation , she had only increased the distance between them by her unconventional request for a meeting . She sat in the little drawing - room , and the cast - bronze clock ticked out the minutes . She would not look out of the window : it might bring bad luck to watch for him . And it seemed to her that a thousand invisible spirits , hidden demons of good and evil , pressed about her , spying out her thoughts , counting her heart - beats , ready to pounce upon the least symptom of over - confidence and turn it deftly to derision . Oh , for an altar on which to pour out propitiatory offerings ! But what sweeter could they have than her smothered heart - beats , her choked - back tears ? The bell rang , and she stood up as if a spring had jerked her to her feet . In the mirror between the dried grasses her face looked long pale inanimate . Ah , if he should find her too changed-- ! If there were but time to dash upstairs and put on a touch of red .... The door opened ; it shut on him ; he was there . He said : “
91182	91186	91176	91176	You	2051	” She answered : “
91189	91269	91176	91176	You	2051	” And her heart seemed to stop beating . At first she could not make out what mysterious change had come over him , and why it was that in looking at him she seemed to be looking at a stranger ; then she perceived that his voice sounded as it used to sound when he was talking to other people ; and she said to herself , with a sick shiver of understanding , that she had become an “
91272	91293	91294	91294	Nick	170	” to him . There was a deathly pause ; then she faltered out , not knowing what she said : “
91300	91304	91294	91294	Nick	170	” He said : “
91307	91393	91394	91394	He	170	” but did not seem to have heard her , for he continued to stand motionless , half the room between them . And slowly the uselessness , the hopelessness of his being there overcame her . A wall of granite seemed to have built itself up between them . She felt as if it hid her from him , as if with those remote new eyes of his he were staring into the wall and not at her . Suddenly she said to herself : “
91421	91441	91403	91403	he	170	” The thought stung her pride , and she lifted her head and met his eyes with a smile . “
91447	91451	91444	91444	you	170	” she said , “
91495	91504	91476	91476	I	0	” A deep flush rose to his forehead . “
91513	91526	91510	91510	I	0	” he declared hastily ; and added , with a factitious animation : “
91534	91535	91529	91529	you	0	” “
91543	91547	91507	91507	I	0	” she continued , “
91571	91584	91585	91585	I	0	” She broke off , and held her hand out to him . “
91593	91611	91585	91585	I	0	” she ended . He just touched her hand with cold fingers , and let it drop . “
91615	91623	91613	91613	you	0	” he said for the third time . “
91630	91635	91624	91624	You	0	” He sat down . “
91641	91645	91638	91638	you	170	” she continued , “
91676	91680	91613	91613	you	0	” He smiled . “
91691	91692	91686	91686	you	0	” “
91700	91743	91686	91686	you	0	” She stopped short , and wondered what on earth she had meant to say next , and why she had so abruptly lost the thread of her discourse . In the pause she heard him cough slightly and clear his throat . “
91750	91754	91745	91745	me	0	” he began , “
91772	91790	91756	91756	I	0	” She lifted her glance again to his walled face , in which not a muscle stirred . “
91806	91807	91812	91812	I	0	” “
91815	91824	91812	91812	I	0	” He paused , and then went on : “
91835	91836	91825	91825	I	0	” “
91839	91843	91825	91825	I	0	” she interrupted , “
91856	91862	91863	91863	Nick	170	” They were again silent . “
91880	91890	91863	91863	Nick	170	” she broke out at last with twitching lips . “
91893	91894	91895	91895	I	0	” “
91915	91916	91912	91912	I	0	” “
91921	91925	91917	91917	I	0	” He hesitated . “
91953	91965	91947	91947	I	0	” She reddened a little , and drew a gasping breath . “
91994	91995	91996	91996	My	0	” “
92009	92022	91996	91996	My	0	” He paused , and added in a tone of laboured ease : “
92032	92039	92023	92023	I	0	” She stared , not understanding . “
92043	92054	92023	92023	I	0	” Her bewilderment drew from him his first frank smile . “
92076	92107	92023	92023	I	0	” At that she suddenly understood , and the blood rushed to her forehead . She stood up without knowing what she was doing , her heart in her throat . “
92115	92122	92123	92123	I	0	” He gave a slight shrug . “
92130	92131	92023	92023	I	0	” “
92153	92166	92023	92023	I	0	” She broke off again , silenced by the echo of that fatal “
92171	92187	92188	92188	You	0	” ... He seemed to prefer not to dwell farther on the legal obligations involved . “
92195	92199	92188	92188	You	0	” he suggested , “
92208	92209	92201	92201	you	0	” “
92217	92229	92201	92201	you	0	” She roused herself , trying to catch his easier note . “
92251	92257	92244	92244	Nat	247	” She did not say : “
92267	92292	92261	92261	I	0	” Somehow it helped her wounded pride a little to keep from him the secret of her precarious independence . He looked his wonder . “
92313	92331	92310	92311	Good Lord	2067	” He contemplated the clock with unseeing eyes , and then turned them again on her face . “
92347	92348	92339	92339	children	616	” “
92362	92363	92355	92355	They	2070	” “
92377	92413	92414	92414	I	0	” He sent his eyes again about the room , which his absent - minded gaze seemed to reduce to its dismal constituent elements , and added , with an obvious effort at small talk : “
92441	92450	92438	92439	Violet Melrose	161	” The blood rose to Susy ’s face . “
92465	92466	92457	92457	He	2071	” “
92478	92495	92474	92474	People	421	” He was visibly embarrassed with the subject , and sorry that he had broached it . “
92540	92541	92528	92528	she	175	” “
92546	92633	92542	92544	Dear old Grace	175	” He had risen from his chair , and this time she made no effort to detain him . He seemed to have recovered his self - composure , and it struck her painfully , humiliatingly almost , that he should have spoken in that light way of the expedition to Fontainebleau on the morrow .... Well , men were different , she supposed ; she remembered having felt that once before about Nick . It was on the tip of her tongue to cry out : “
92647	92691	92542	92544	Dear old Grace	175	all!”--but to do so would seem like an appeal to his compassion , to his indulgence ; and that was not what she wanted . She could never forget that he had left her because he had not been able to forgive her for “
92692	92713	92715	92715	he	267	managing”--and not for the world would she have him think that this meeting had been planned for such a purpose . “
92767	92779	92781	92781	he	267	” she mused . And then , her thoughts hurrying on : “
92838	92847	92822	92822	he	267	” There he stood -- the man who was “
92854	92859	92822	92822	he	267	” ; who called it “
92865	92917	92822	92822	he	267	” Who could smile as he made the careless statement ! A world seemed to divide them already : it was as if their parting were already over . All the words , cries , arguments beating loud wings in her dropped back into silence . The only thought left was : “
92930	92955	92922	92922	he	267	” He may have read the question in her face , for turning back from an absorbed contemplation of the window curtains he said : “
92961	92962	92922	92922	he	267	” “
92966	92967	92922	92922	he	267	” “
92978	92993	92971	92971	you	267	” She flushed , suddenly remembering the pretext she had used to summon him . “
92996	93000	92971	92971	you	267	” she faltered , “
93019	93029	93013	93014	the lawyers	1858	” She saw the relief on his contracted face . “
93047	93055	93045	93045	I	0	you”--again for a moment the smile strained his lips--“I
93066	93094	93045	93045	I	0	” She stood motionless , feeling herself turn to stone . He appeared already a long way off , like a figure vanishing down a remote perspective . “
93101	93111	93045	93045	I	0	” she heard him say from its farther end . “
93116	93155	93156	93156	I’ve--	2078	” she faltered , as if she had not had the word ready , and was relieved to have him supply it . He stopped again on the threshold , looked back at her , began to speak . “
93157	93164	93156	93156	I’ve--	2078	” he said ; then he repeated “
93169	93367	93156	93156	I’ve--	2078	” as though to make sure he had not forgotten to say it ; and the door closed on him . It was over ; she had had her last chance and missed it . Now , whatever happened , the one thing she had lived and longed for would never be . He had come , and she had let him go again .... How had it come about ? Would she ever be able to explain it to herself ? How was it that she , so fertile in strategy , so practiced in feminine arts , had stood there before him , helpless , inarticulate , like a school - girl a - choke with her first love - longing ? If he was gone , and gone never to return , it was her own fault , and none but hers . What had she done to move him , detain him , make his heart beat and his head swim as hers were beating and swimming ? She stood aghast at her own inadequacy , her stony inexpressiveness .... And suddenly she lifted her hands to her throbbing forehead and cried out : “
93378	93631	93156	93156	I’ve--	2078	” She had loved him before , she supposed ; for what else was she to call the impulse that had drawn her to him , taught her how to overcome his scruples , and whirled him away with her on their mad adventure ? Well , if that was love , this was something so much larger and deeper that the other feeling seemed the mere dancing of her blood in tune with his .... But , no ! Real love , great love , the love that poets sang , and privileged and tortured beings lived and died of , that love had its own superior expressiveness , and the sure command of its means . The petty arts of coquetry were no farther from it than the numbness of the untaught girl . Great love was wise , strong , powerful , like genius , like any other dominant form of human power . It knew itself , and what it wanted , and how to attain its ends . Not great love , then ... but just the common humble average of human love was hers . And it had come to her so newly , so overwhelmingly , with a face so grave , a touch so startling , that she had stood there petrified , humbled at the first look of its eyes , recognizing that what she had once taken for love was merely pleasure and spring - time , and the flavour of youth . “
93646	93843	93844	93844	Junie	315	” she wailed . XXIX . THE inhabitants of the little house in Passy were of necessity early risers ; but when Susy jumped out of bed the next morning no one else was astir , and it lacked nearly an hour of the call of the bonne ’s alarm - clock . For a moment Susy leaned out of her dark room into the darker night . A cold drizzle fell on her face , and she shivered and drew back . Then , lighting a candle , and shading it , as her habit was , from the sleeping child , she slipped on her dressing - gown and opened the door . On the threshold she paused to look at her watch . Only half - past five ! She thought with compunction of the unkindness of breaking in on Junie Fulmer ’s slumbers ; but such scruples did not weigh an ounce in the balance of her purpose . Poor Junie would have to oversleep herself on Sunday , that was all . Susy stole into the passage , opened a door , and cast her light on the girl ’s face . “
93854	93889	93893	93893	them	2079	” Junie lay in the abandonment of youthful sleep ; but at the sound of her name she sat up with the promptness of a grown person on whom domestic burdens have long weighed . “
93897	93908	93893	93893	them	2079	” she asked , one foot already out of bed . “
93928	93952	93955	93955	Susy	159	” Susy stammered , on her knees by the bed . In the candlelight , she saw Junie ’s anxious brow darken reproachfully . “
93982	93983	93980	93980	mother	2260	” “
94004	94014	93996	93996	I	0	” She felt the little girl ’s awakening scrutiny . “
94043	94044	94080	94080	Susy	159	” “
94049	94062	94067	94067	me	0	” Susy rose from her knees and sat down on the counterpane . “
94076	94077	94070	94070	I	0	” “
94088	94107	94108	94108	Junie	258	” Junie ’s arms were about her in a flash , and Susy grasped them in burning fingers . “
94170	94181	94166	94166	I’ve	0	” Junie considered her agitated face with fully awakened eyes . “
94196	94206	94207	94207	Junie	258	” she said with simplicity . Susy hugged her . “
94311	94377	94302	94302	Junie	258	” she sobbed out , clutching the child tighter . Junie Fulmer , with her strangely mature perception of the case , and seemingly of every case that fate might call on her to deal with , sat for a moment motionless in Susy ’s hold . Then she freed her wrists with an adroit twist , and leaning back against the pillows said judiciously : “
94403	94418	94392	94392	you	258	” Through all her turmoil of spirit the observation drew a laugh from Susy . “
94440	94446	94435	94435	I	0	” Junie still considered her . “
94461	94472	94473	94473	I	0	” she pronounced . Susy rose with a laughing sigh . “
94510	94519	94501	94501	I	0	” Junie still seemed to examine the case . “
94531	94546	94522	94522	you	0	” she ventured , as if not quite sure of the delicacy of asking . “
94596	94597	94587	94587	I	0	” “
94613	94614	94605	94605	you	0	” “
94639	94640	94627	94627	I	0	” “
94666	94980	94981	94981	I	0	” emended Junie , still judicious . Susy again enfolded her vehemently , and then turned to more practical matters . She explained that she wished if possible to catch an eight - thirty train from the Gare de Lyon , and that there was not a moment to lose if the children were to be dressed and fed , and full instructions written out for Junie and Angele , before she rushed for the underground . While she bathed Geordie , and then hurried into her own clothes , she could not help wondering at her own extreme solicitude for her charges . She remembered , with a pang , how often she had deserted Clarissa Vanderlyn for the whole day , and even for two or three in succession -- poor little Clarissa , whom she knew to be so unprotected , so exposed to evil influences . She had been too much absorbed in her own greedy bliss to be more than intermittently aware of the child ; but now , she felt , no sorrow however ravaging , no happiness however absorbing , would ever again isolate her from her kind . And then these children were so different ! The exquisite Clarissa was already the predestined victim of her surroundings : her budding soul was divided from Susy ’s by the same barrier of incomprehension that separated the latter from Mrs. Vanderlyn . Clarissa had nothing to teach Susy but the horror of her own hard little appetites ; whereas the company of the noisy argumentative Fulmers had been a school of wisdom and abnegation . As she applied the brush to Geordie ’s shining head and the handkerchief to his snuffling nose , the sense of what she owed him was so borne in on Susy that she interrupted the process to catch him to her bosom . “
95009	95024	94999	94999	you	2103	” she bargained with him ; and Geordie , always astute , bargained back : “
95037	95253	95029	95029	I	0	” At length all was in order . Junie had been enlightened , and Angele stunned , by the minuteness of Susy ’s instructions ; and the latter , waterproofed and stoutly shod , descended the doorstep , and paused to wave at the pyramid of heads yearning to her from an upper window . It was hardly light , and still raining , when she turned into the dismal street . As usual , it was empty ; but at the corner she perceived a hesitating taxi , with luggage piled beside the driver . Perhaps it was some early traveller , just arriving , who would release the carriage in time for her to catch it , and thus avoid the walk to the metro , and the subsequent strap - hanging ; for it was the work - people ’s hour . Susy raced toward the vehicle , which , overcoming its hesitation , was beginning to move in her direction . Observing this , she stopped to see where it would discharge its load . Thereupon the taxi stopped also , and the load discharged itself in front of her in the shape of Nick Lansing . The two stood staring at each other through the rain till Nick broke out : “
95265	95266	95259	95259	I	0	” “
95275	95330	95259	95259	I	0	” she repeated . Beside the driver she had suddenly remarked the old suit - case from which her husband had obliged her to extract Strefford ’s cigars as they were leaving Como ; and everything that had happened since seemed to fall away and vanish in the pang and rapture of that memory . “
95340	95355	95259	95259	I	0	” He spoke the words peremptorily , almost as if they were an order . “
95361	95386	95358	95358	you	2104	” he repeated . Without answering , she turned toward the house . He followed her , and the laden taxi closed the procession . “
95398	95416	95358	95358	you	2104	” he continued , in the same severe tone , drawing her under the shelter of his . “
95445	95457	95436	95436	I	0	” She spoke the words like a person in a trance . “
95469	95540	95541	95541	I	0	” They were on the doorstep , and she fumbled automatically for her key , let herself in , and led the way to the sitting - room . It had not been tidied up since the night before . The children ’s school books lay scattered on the table and sofa , and the empty fireplace was grey with ashes . She turned to Nick in the pallid light . “
95548	95552	95541	95541	I	0	” she stammered , “
95573	95582	95584	95584	me	0	” He repeated in the same aggressive tone : “
95590	95591	95584	95584	me	0	” “
95624	95674	95675	95675	I	0	” He stared , and then burst into a laugh . The blood rushed to her face . She had caught a familiar ring in his laugh , and it wounded her . What business had he , at such a time , to laugh in the old way ? “
95696	95707	95686	95686	I	0	” he corrected himself . She raised her head sharply . “
95710	95711	95686	95686	I	0	” “
95722	95741	95716	95717	the woman.--Oh	2108	” He had dropped his mocking smile , and was at her side , her hands in his . “
95867	95954	95955	95955	Susy	159	” She stood before him numb . Yes , numb : that was the worst of it ! The violence of the reaction had been too great , and she could hardly understand what he was saying . Instead , she noticed that the tassel of the window - blind was torn off again ( oh , those children ! ) , and vaguely wondered if his luggage were safe on the waiting taxi . One heard such stories .... His voice came back to her . “
95959	95964	95965	95965	You	159	” he was entreating . “
96098	96106	96097	96097	us--	2121	” Through her tears she gasped out : “
96121	96131	96116	96116	I	0	” He was upon her with a great embrace . “
96143	96144	96138	96138	You	2122	” “
96147	96151	96138	96138	You	2122	” she panted . “
96160	96164	96155	96155	I	0	” She paused . “
96171	96193	96166	96166	you	2122	” She felt his embrace relax . He drew away a little , still holding her , but with lowered head . “
96201	96202	96196	96196	I	0	” “
96210	96220	96205	96205	Nick	170	” He caught her to him again , resentfully . “
96238	96239	96228	96228	you	2122	” “
96252	96268	96251	96251	her--	2126	” ( Try as she would , her voice was full of silver chimes . ) “
96275	96279	96251	96251	her--	2126	” he echoed . “
96320	96351	96318	96318	I	0	” Between crying and laughing she lay on his breast , and his hand passed over her hair . They were silent for a while ; then he began again : “
96361	96369	96352	96352	You	2122	” She strayed back from sunlit distances . “
96372	96373	96352	96352	You	2122	” “
96394	96395	96377	96378	Grace Fulmer	175	” “
96417	96421	96409	96409	you	0	” she interrupted . “
96429	96487	96488	96488	He	2128	” He seized on the word as if it had just been coined to express their case , and his mind could rest in it without farther labour . The door - bell rang , and they started . Through the window they saw the taxi - driver gesticulating enquiries as to the fate of the luggage . “
96500	96504	96488	96488	He	2128	” Susy laughed . “
96516	96521	96509	96509	You	2122	” her husband declared . “
96526	96537	96524	96524	you	2122	” She laughed again at the absurdity of the suggestion . “
96565	96569	96570	96570	My	0	” he commanded . “
96584	96593	96577	96577	I	0	” He stared , between indignation and amusement . “
96615	96625	96607	96607	you	2122	” She reddened again , this time a little painfully “
96655	96656	96642	96642	I	0	” “
96661	96671	96642	96642	I	0	” She nodded , and met his gaze resolutely . “
96676	96677	96680	96680	I	0	” “
96699	96700	96693	96693	I	0	” “
96721	96722	96713	96713	ca	2133	” “
96731	96732	96729	96729	me	0	” “
96736	96737	96729	96729	me	0	” “
96747	96751	96729	96729	me	0	” she pleaded . “
96766	96781	96764	96764	you	2122	” He seized her by both wrists , and drew them against his breast . “
96793	96798	96791	96791	Susy	159	” he entreated her . “
96801	96805	96791	96791	Susy	159	” she cried , “
96818	96819	96820	96820	Susy	159	” “
96842	96843	96844	96844	Nick	170	” “
96846	96871	96844	96844	Nick	170	” she sighed , at peace , as if the one syllable were a magic seed that hung out great branches to envelop them . “
96883	96884	96876	96876	Susy	159	” “
96891	96897	96876	96876	Susy	159	” she sobbed through laughter . “
96907	96917	96918	96918	Nick	170	” She freed herself , and drew back gently . “
96996	97007	96990	96992	the wisest people	2139	” She paused , and a sudden inspiration illuminated her . “
97018	97036	97012	97012	we	2140	” she exclaimed . Her husband ’s arms fell away from her , and he stood dumfounded . “
97042	97043	97012	97012	we	2140	” “
97047	97048	97049	97052	All five of them	2141	” “
97054	97055	97049	97052	All five of them	2141	” “
97080	97081	97069	97069	Nat	174	” “
97085	97089	97069	97069	Nat	174	” he groaned . “
97111	97154	97155	97155	Nick	170	” The word stopped her short , and an agony of crimson suffused her from brow to throat . Their eyes met ; and without a word he stooped and laid his lips gently on the stain of red on her neck . “
97157	97166	97155	97155	Nick	170	” she breathed , her hands in his . “
97170	97178	97155	97155	Nick	170	” Instead of answering , she questioned : “
97184	97190	97155	97155	Nick	170	” His face lit up . “
97199	97200	97196	97196	you	2143	” “
97207	97211	97203	97203	I	0	” she exulted . “
97233	97238	97231	97231	we	2140	” he questioned weakly . “
97251	97262	97231	97231	we	2140	” Her eyes were already travelling far ahead of him . “
97316	97329	97306	97306	I	0	” she hurried on , nearly tripping again over the fatal word . “
97396	97441	97391	97391	Geordie	305	” she explained , surprised to find herself , even in the rapture of reunion , so absorbed in the welfare of the Fulmers . She was conscious that her husband was surprised also ; but instead of prolonging the argument he simply questioned : “
97462	97466	97452	97452	you	0	” She echoed : “
97477	97478	97467	97467	I	0	” “
97486	97487	97467	97467	I	0	” “
97490	97494	97495	97495	you	0	” she sobbed , “
97503	97636	97499	97499	You	0	” He held her to him , and the currents flowed between them warm and full as on the night of their moon over Como . In a trice , after that , she had the matter in hand and her forces marshalled . The taxi was paid , Nick ’s luggage deposited in the vestibule , and the children , just piling down to breakfast , were summoned in to hear the news . It was apparent that , seasoned to surprises as they were , Nick ’s presence took them aback . But when , between laughter and embraces , his identity , and his right to be where he was , had been made clear to them , Junie dismissed the matter by asking him in her practical way : “
97647	99146	97638	97638	I	0	now?”--and thereafter all five addressed themselves to the vision of their imminent holiday . From that moment the little house became the centre of a whirlwind . Treats so unforeseen , and of such magnitude , were rare in the young Fulmers ’ experience , and had it not been for Junie ’s steadying influence Susy ’s charges would have got out of hand . But young Nat , appealed to by Nick on the ground of their common manhood , was induced to forego celebrating the event on his motor horn ( the very same which had tortured the New Hampshire echoes ) , and to assert his authority over his juniors ; and finally a plan began to emerge from the chaos , and each child to fit into it like a bit of a picture puzzle . Susy , riding the whirlwind with her usual firmness , nevertheless felt an undercurrent of anxiety . There had been no time as yet , between her and Nick , to revert to money matters ; and where there was so little money it could not , obviously , much matter . But that was the more reason for being secretly aghast at her intrepid resolve not to separate herself from her charges . A three days ’ honey - moon with five children in the party -- and children with the Fulmer appetite -- could not but be a costly business ; and while she settled details , packed them off to school , and routed out such nondescript receptacles as the house contained in the way of luggage , her thoughts remained fixed on the familiar financial problem . Yes -- it was cruel to have it rear its hated head , even through the bursting boughs of her new spring ; but there it was , the perpetual serpent in her Eden , to be bribed , fed , sent to sleep with such scraps as she could beg , borrow or steal for it . And she supposed it was the price that fate meant her to pay for her blessedness , and was surer than ever that the blessedness was worth it . Only , how was she to compound the business with her new principles ? With the children ’s things to pack , luncheon to be got ready , and the Fontainebleau pension to be telephoned to , there was little time to waste on moral casuistry ; and Susy asked herself with a certain irony if the chronic lack of time to deal with money difficulties had not been the chief cause of her previous lapses . There was no time to deal with this question either ; no time , in short , to do anything but rush forward on a great gale of plans and preparations , in the course of which she whirled Nick forth to buy some charcuterie for luncheon , and telephone to Fontainebleau . Once he was gone -- and after watching him safely round the corner -- she too got into her wraps , and transferring a small packet from her dressing - case to her pocket , hastened out in a different direction . XXX . IT took two brimming taxi - cabs to carry the Nicholas Lansings to the station on their second honey - moon . In the first were Nick , Susy and the luggage of the whole party ( little Nat ’s motor horn included , as a last concession , and because he had hitherto forborne to play on it ) ; and in the second , the five Fulmers , the bonne , who at the eleventh hour had refused to be left , a cage - full of canaries , and a foundling kitten who had murderous designs on them ; all of which had to be taken because , if the bonne came , there would be nobody left to look after them . At the corner Susy tore herself from Nick ’s arms and held up the procession while she ran back to the second taxi to make sure that the bonne had brought the house - key . It was found of course that she had n’t but that Junie had ; whereupon the caravan got under way again , and reached the station just as the train was starting ; and there , by some miracle of good nature on the part of the guard , they were all packed together into an empty compartment -- no doubt , as Susy remarked , because train officials never failed to spot a newly - married couple , and treat them kindly . The children , sentinelled by Junie , at first gave promise of superhuman goodness ; but presently their feelings overflowed , and they were not to be quieted till it had been agreed that Nat should blow his motor - horn at each halt , while the twins called out the names of the stations , and Geordie , with the canaries and kitten , affected to change trains . Luckily the halts were few ; but the excitement of travel , combined with over - indulgence in the chocolates imprudently provided by Nick , overwhelmed Geordie with a sudden melancholy that could be appeased only by Susy ’s telling him stories till they arrived at Fontainebleau . The day was soft , with mild gleams of sunlight on decaying foliage ; and after luggage and livestock had been dropped at the pension Susy confessed that she had promised the children a scamper in the forest , and buns in a tea - shop afterward . Nick placidly agreed , and darkness had long fallen , and a great many buns been consumed , when at length the procession turned down the street toward the pension , headed by Nick with the sleeping Geordie on his shoulder , while the others , speechless with fatigue and food , hung heavily on Susy . It had been decided that , as the bonne was of the party , the children might be entrusted to her for the night , and Nick and Susy establish themselves in an adjacent hotel . Nick had flattered himself that they might remove their possessions there when they returned from the tea - room ; but Susy , manifestly surprised at the idea , reminded him that her charges must first be given their supper and put to bed . She suggested that he should meanwhile take the bags to the hotel , and promised to join him as soon as Geordie was asleep . She was a long time coming , but waiting for her was sweet , even in a deserted hotel reading - room insufficiently heated by a sulky stove ; and after he had glanced through his morning ’s mail , hurriedly thrust into his pocket as he left Paris , he sank into a state of drowsy beatitude . It was all the maddest business in the world , yet it did not give him the sense of unreality that had made their first adventure a mere golden dream ; and he sat and waited with the security of one in whom dear habits have struck deep roots . In this mood of acquiescence even the presence of the five Fulmers seemed a natural and necessary consequence of all the rest ; and when Susy at length appeared , a little pale and tired , with the brooding inward look that busy mothers bring from the nursery , that too seemed natural and necessary , and part of the new order of things . They had wandered out to a cheap restaurant for dinner ; now , in the damp December night , they were walking back to the hotel under a sky full of rain - clouds . They seemed to have said everything to each other , and yet barely to have begun what they had to tell ; and at each step they took , their heavy feet dragged a great load of bliss . In the hotel almost all the lights were already out ; and they groped their way to the third floor room which was the only one that Susy had found cheap enough . A ray from a street - lamp struck up through the unshuttered windows ; and after Nick had revived the fire they drew their chairs close to it , and sat quietly for a while in the dark . Their silence was so sweet that Nick could not make up his mind to break it ; not to do so gave his tossing spirit such a sense of permanence , of having at last unlimited time before him in which to taste his joy and let its sweetness stream through him . But at length he roused himself to say : “
99173	99180	99168	99168	I	0	” Susy took the announcement serenely . “
99189	99212	99183	99183	you	0	” she commented , as if the day had been too obviously designed for bliss to escape the notice of its dispensers . “
99215	99225	99183	99183	you	0	” he continued with a thrill of pardonable pride . “
99308	99369	99374	99374	Nick	200	” He had expected a rapturous outburst , and perhaps some reassertion of wifely faith in the glorious future that awaited The Pageant of Alexander ; and deep down under the lover ’s well - being the author felt a faint twinge of mortified vanity when Susy , leaping to her feet , cried out , ravenously and without preamble : “
99386	99397	99381	99381	they	2161	” He flourished the cheque before her in the firelight . “
99407	99408	99381	99381	they	2161	” “
99412	99449	99450	99450	Susy	159	” she gasped , as if the good news had been almost too much for her tense nerves ; and then surprised him by dropping to the ground , and burying her face against his knees . “
99455	99466	99453	99453	Susy	159	” he whispered , his hand on her shaking shoulder . “
99480	99481	99475	99475	You	159	” “
99509	99528	99496	99496	I	0	” A faint chill ran over him , and involuntarily his hand drew back from her bowed figure . “
99536	99540	99496	99496	I	0	” he protested . “
99553	99554	99496	99496	I	0	” “
99568	99596	99599	99599	Nick	200	” She straightened herself , still kneeling before him , and lifted her head so that the firelight behind her turned her hair into a ruddy halo . “
99616	99695	99608	99608	I	0	” she faltered out . He felt himself recoiling under the hands with which she clutched his knees . For an instant he did not remember what she alluded to ; it was the mere mention of Ellie Vanderlyn ’s name that had fallen between them like an icy shadow . What an incorrigible fool he had been to think they could ever shake off such memories , or cease to be the slaves of such a past ! “
99701	99718	99608	99608	I	0	” he said , suddenly understanding , and feeling the chill mount slowly to his lips . “
99801	99818	99791	99791	she	184	” To save his life he could have found no answer , and she pressed on : “
99939	99988	99930	99930	I	0	” She flung her arms about him , and he held her fast , wondering if the tears he felt were hers or his . Still he did not speak ; but as he clasped her close she added , with an irrepressible flash of her old irony : “
100017	100343	100000	100000	She	184	” For a long time she continued to lean against him , her head on his knees , as she had done on the terrace of Como on the last night of their honeymoon . She had ceased to talk , and he sat silent also , passing his hand quietly to and fro over her hair . The first rapture had been succeeded by soberer feelings . Her confession had broken up the frozen pride about his heart , and humbled him to the earth ; but it had also roused forgotten things , memories and scruples swept aside in the first rush of their reunion . He and she belonged to each other for always : he understood that now . The impulse which had first drawn them together again , in spite of reason , in spite of themselves almost , that deep - seated instinctive need that each had of the other , would never again wholly let them go . Yet as he sat there he thought of Strefford , he thought of Coral Hicks . He had been a coward in regard to Coral , and Susy had been sincere and courageous in regard to Strefford . Yet his mind dwelt on Coral with tenderness , with compunction , with remorse ; and he was almost sure that Susy had already put Strefford utterly out of her mind . It was the old contrast between the two ways of loving , the man ’s way and the woman ’s ; and after a moment it seemed to Nick natural enough that Susy , from the very moment of finding him again , should feel neither pity nor regret , and that Strefford should already be to her as if he had never been . After all , there was something Providential in such arrangements . He stooped closer , pressed her dreaming head between his hands , and whispered : “
