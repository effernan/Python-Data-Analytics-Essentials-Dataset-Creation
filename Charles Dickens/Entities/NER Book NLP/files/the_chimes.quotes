1001	1006	991	991	they	105	’ Wester ; aye , ‘
1011	1278	991	991	they	105	’ as Toby Veck said;—for though they chose to call him Trotty Veck , his name was Toby , and nobody could make it anything else either ( except Tobias ) without a special act of parliament ; he having been as lawfully christened in his day as the Bells had been in theirs , though with not quite so much of solemnity or public rejoicing . For my part , I confess myself of Toby Veck ’s belief , for I am sure he had opportunities enough of forming a correct one . And whatever Toby Veck said , I say . And I take my stand by Toby Veck , although he _ did _ stand all day long ( and weary work it was ) just outside the church - door . In fact he was a ticket - porter , Toby Veck , and waited there for jobs . And a breezy , goose - skinned , blue - nosed , red - eyed , stony - toed , tooth - chattering place it was , to wait in , in the winter - time , as Toby Veck well knew . The wind came tearing round the corner — especially the east wind — as if it had sallied forth , express , from the confines of the earth , to have a blow at Toby . And oftentimes it seemed to come upon him sooner than it had expected , for bouncing round the corner , and passing Toby , it would suddenly wheel round again , as if it cried ‘
1285	2873	1282	1282	he	117	’ Incontinently his little white apron would be caught up over his head like a naughty boy ’s garments , and his feeble little cane would be seen to wrestle and struggle unavailingly in his hand , and his legs would undergo tremendous agitation , and Toby himself all aslant , and facing now in this direction , now in that , would be so banged and buffeted , and touzled , and worried , and hustled , and lifted off his feet , as to render it a state of things but one degree removed from a positive miracle , that he was n’t carried up bodily into the air as a colony of frogs or snails or other very portable creatures sometimes are , and rained down again , to the great astonishment of the natives , on some strange corner of the world where ticket - porters are unknown . But , windy weather , in spite of its using him so roughly , was , after all , a sort of holiday for Toby . That ’s the fact . He did n’t seem to wait so long for a sixpence in the wind , as at other times ; the having to fight with that boisterous element took off his attention , and quite freshened him up , when he was getting hungry and low - spirited . A hard frost too , or a fall of snow , was an Event ; and it seemed to do him good , somehow or other — it would have been hard to say in what respect though , Toby ! So wind and frost and snow , and perhaps a good stiff storm of hail , were Toby Veck ’s red - letter days . Wet weather was the worst ; the cold , damp , clammy wet , that wrapped him up like a moist great - coat — the only kind of great - coat Toby owned , or could have added to his comfort by dispensing with . Wet days , when the rain came slowly , thickly , obstinately down ; when the street ’s throat , like his own , was choked with mist ; when smoking umbrellas passed and re - passed , spinning round and round like so many teetotums , as they knocked against each other on the crowded footway , throwing off a little whirlpool of uncomfortable sprinklings ; when gutters brawled and waterspouts were full and noisy ; when the wet from the projecting stones and ledges of the church fell drip , drip , drip , on Toby , making the wisp of straw on which he stood mere mud in no time ; those were the days that tried him . Then , indeed , you might see Toby looking anxiously out from his shelter in an angle of the church wall — such a meagre shelter that in summer time it never cast a shadow thicker than a good - sized walking stick upon the sunny pavement — with a disconsolate and lengthened face . But coming out , a minute afterwards , to warm himself by exercise , and trotting up and down some dozen times , he would brighten even then , and go back more brightly to his niche . They called him Trotty from his pace , which meant speed if it did n’t make it . He could have walked faster perhaps ; most likely ; but rob him of his trot , and Toby would have taken to his bed and died . It bespattered him with mud in dirty weather ; it cost him a world of trouble ; he could have walked with infinitely greater ease ; but that was one reason for his clinging to it so tenaciously . A weak , small , spare old man , he was a very Hercules , this Toby , in his good intentions . He loved to earn his money . He delighted to believe — Toby was very poor , and could n’t well afford to part with a delight — that he was worth his salt . With a shilling or an eighteenpenny message or small parcel in hand , his courage always high , rose higher . As he trotted on , he would call out to fast Postmen ahead of him , to get out of the way ; devoutly believing that in the natural course of things he must inevitably overtake and run them down ; and he had perfect faith — not often tested — in his being able to carry anything that man could lift . Thus , even when he came out of his nook to warm himself on a wet day , Toby trotted . Making , with his leaky shoes , a crooked line of slushy footprints in the mire ; and blowing on his chilly hands and rubbing them against each other , poorly defended from the searching cold by threadbare mufflers of grey worsted , with a private apartment only for the thumb , and a common room or tap for the rest of the fingers ; Toby , with his knees bent and his cane beneath his arm , still trotted . Falling out into the road to look up at the belfry when the Chimes resounded , Toby trotted still . He made this last excursion several times a day , for they were company to him ; and when he heard their voices , he had an interest in glancing at their lodging - place , and thinking how they were moved , and what hammers beat upon them . Perhaps he was the more curious about these Bells , because there were points of resemblance between themselves and him . They hung there , in all weathers , with the wind and rain driving in upon them ; facing only the outsides of all those houses ; never getting any nearer to the blazing fires that gleamed and shone upon the windows , or came puffing out of the chimney tops ; and incapable of participation in any of the good things that were constantly being handed through the street doors and the area railings , to prodigious cooks . Faces came and went at many windows : sometimes pretty faces , youthful faces , pleasant faces : sometimes the reverse : but Toby knew no more ( though he often speculated on these trifles , standing idle in the streets ) whence they came , or where they went , or whether , when the lips moved , one kind word was said of him in all the year , than did the Chimes themselves . Toby was not a casuist — that he knew of , at least — and I do n’t mean to say that when he began to take to the Bells , and to knit up his first rough acquaintance with them into something of a closer and more delicate woof , he passed through these considerations one by one , or held any formal review or great field - day in his thoughts . But what I mean to say , and do say is , that as the functions of Toby ’s body , his digestive organs for example , did of their own cunning , and by a great many operations of which he was altogether ignorant , and the knowledge of which would have astonished him very much , arrive at a certain end ; so his mental faculties , without his privity or concurrence , set all these wheels and springs in motion , with a thousand others , when they worked to bring about his liking for the Bells . And though I had said his love , I would not have recalled the word , though it would scarcely have expressed his complicated feeling . For , being but a simple man , he invested them with a strange and solemn character . They were so mysterious , often heard and never seen ; so high up , so far off , so full of such a deep strong melody , that he regarded them with a species of awe ; and sometimes when he looked up at the dark arched windows in the tower , he half expected to be beckoned to by something which was not a Bell , and yet was what he had heard so often sounding in the Chimes . For all this , Toby scouted with indignation a certain flying rumour that the Chimes were haunted , as implying the possibility of their being connected with any Evil thing . In short , they were very often in his ears , and very often in his thoughts , but always in his good opinion ; and he very often got such a crick in his neck by staring with his mouth wide open , at the steeple where they hung , that he was fain to take an extra trot or two , afterwards , to cure it . The very thing he was in the act of doing one cold day , when the last drowsy sound of Twelve o’clock , just struck , was humming like a melodious monster of a Bee , and not by any means a busy bee , all through the steeple ! ‘
2880	2892	1282	1282	he	117	’ said Toby , trotting up and down before the church . ‘
2895	2947	1282	1282	he	117	’ Toby ’s nose was very red , and his eyelids were very red , and he winked very much , and his shoulders were very near his ears , and his legs were very stiff , and altogether he was evidently a long way upon the frosty side of cool . ‘
2954	2979	1282	1282	he	117	’ repeated Toby , using his right - hand muffler like an infantine boxing - glove , and punishing his chest for being cold . ‘
2988	3004	1282	1282	he	117	’ He took a silent trot , after that , for a minute or two . ‘
3009	3066	1282	1282	he	117	’ said Toby , breaking forth afresh — but here he stopped short in his trot , and with a face of great interest and some alarm , felt his nose carefully all the way up . It was but a little way ( not being much of a nose ) and he had soon finished . ‘
3073	3081	3067	3067	I	0	’ said Toby , trotting off again . ‘
3186	3202	3182	3183	the baker	121	’ The reflection reminded him of that other reflection , which he had left unfinished . ‘
3207	3211	3182	3183	the baker	121	’ said Toby , ‘
3240	3280	3281	3281	Toby	19	’em . It ’s took me a long time to find it out . I wonder whether it would be worth any gentleman ’s while , now , to buy that obserwation for the Papers ; or the Parliament ! ’
3297	3302	3304	3304	Toby	19	‘ Why ! Lord ! ’
3306	3332	3304	3304	Toby	19	‘ The Papers is full of obserwations as it is ; and so ’s the Parliament . Here ’s last week ’s paper , now ; ’
3352	3373	3375	3375	Toby	19	‘ full of obserwations ! Full of obserwations ! I like to know the news as well as any man , ’
3393	3443	3375	3375	Toby	19	‘ but it almost goes against the grain with me to read a paper now . It frightens me almost . I do n’t know what we poor people are coming to . Lord send we may be coming to something better in the New Year nigh upon us ! ’
3444	3451	3375	3375	Toby	19	‘ Why , father , father ! ’
3484	3503	3505	3505	Toby	19	‘ It seems as if we ca n’t go right , or do right , or be righted , ’
3507	3636	3638	3638	Toby	19	‘ I had n’t much schooling , myself , when I was young ; and I ca n’t make out whether we have any business on the face of the earth , or not . Sometimes I think we must have — a little ; and sometimes I think we must be intruding . I get so puzzled sometimes that I am not even able to make up my mind whether there is any good at all in us , or whether we are born bad . We seem to be dreadful things ; we seem to give a deal of trouble ; we are always being complained of and guarded against . One way or other , we fill the papers . Talk of a New Year ! ’
3642	3700	3638	3638	Toby	19	‘ I can bear up as well as another man at most times ; better than a good many , for I am as strong as a lion , and all men an’t ; but supposing it should really be that we have no right to a New Year — supposing we really _ are _ intruding — ’
3701	3708	3715	3715	Toby	19	‘ Why , father , father ! ’
3889	3901	3878	3878	they	125	‘ I think we have some business here — a little ! ’
3920	3925	3927	3927	Trotty	20	‘ Why , Pet , ’
3929	3946	3927	3927	Trotty	20	‘ What ’s to do ? I did n’t expect you to - day , Meg . ’
3947	3957	3959	3960	the girl	126	‘ Neither did I expect to come , father , ’
3971	3984	3968	3968	she	126	‘ But here I am ! And not alone ; not alone ! ’
3985	3994	3996	3996	Trotty	20	‘ Why you do n’t mean to say , ’
4011	4015	3968	3968	she	126	‘ that you — ’
4016	4023	4025	4025	Meg	25	‘ Smell it , father dear , ’
4027	4032	4025	4025	Meg	25	‘ Only smell it ! ’
4056	4063	4065	4065	Meg	25	‘ No , no , no , ’
4074	4104	4106	4106	Meg	25	‘ Lengthen it out a little . Let me just lift up the corner ; just the lit - tle ti - ny cor - ner , you know , ’
4138	4147	4126	4126	she	25	‘ there . Now . What ’s that ? ’
4168	4175	4148	4148	Toby	19	‘ Why , it ’s hot ! ’
4176	4182	4184	4184	Meg	25	‘ It ’s burning hot ! ’
4186	4198	4148	4148	Toby	19	‘ Ha , ha , ha ! It ’s scalding hot ! ’
4199	4206	4208	4208	Toby	19	‘ Ha , ha , ha ! ’
4216	4222	4208	4208	Toby	19	‘ It ’s scalding hot ! ’
4223	4231	4233	4233	Meg	25	‘ But what is it , father ? ’
4235	4293	4233	4233	Meg	25	‘ Come . You have n’t guessed what it is . And you must guess what it is . I ca n’t think of taking it out , till you guess what it is . Do n’t be in such a hurry ! Wait a minute ! A little bit more of the cover . Now guess ! ’
4402	4410	4412	4412	Toby	19	‘ Ah ! It ’s very nice , ’
4414	4424	4412	4412	Toby	19	‘ It an’t — I suppose it an’t Polonies ? ’
4425	4432	4434	4434	Meg	25	‘ No , no , no ! ’
4438	4443	4434	4434	Meg	25	‘ Nothing like Polonies ! ’
4444	4447	4449	4449	Toby	19	‘ No , ’
4455	4484	4449	4449	Toby	19	‘ It’s — it ’s mellower than Polonies . It ’s very nice . It improves every moment . It ’s too decided for Trotters . An’t it ? ’
4506	4509	4511	4511	Toby	19	‘ Liver ? ’
4517	4550	4515	4515	himself	19	‘ No . There ’s a mildness about it that do n’t answer to liver . Pettitoes ? No . It an’t faint enough for pettitoes . It wants the stringiness of Cocks ’
4572	4573	4560	4560	I	0	’ ‘
4579	4589	4560	4560	I	0	’ cried Meg , in a burst of delight . ‘
4595	4596	4560	4560	I	0	’ ‘
4607	4628	4629	4629	I	0	’ said Toby , suddenly recovering a position as near the perpendicular as it was possible for him to assume . ‘
4641	4672	4637	4637	It	128	’ Tripe it was ; and Meg , in high joy , protested he should say , in half a minute more , it was the best tripe ever stewed . ‘
4676	4687	4688	4688	I	0	’ said Meg , busying herself exultingly with the basket , ‘
4755	4756	4753	4753	father	860	’ ‘
4766	4770	4753	4753	father	860	’ said Toby . ‘
4773	4785	4753	4753	father	860	’re always a - bringing up some new law or other . ’
4786	4839	4772	4772	they	132	‘ And according to what I was reading you in the paper the other day , father ; what the Judge said , you know ; we poor people are supposed to know them all . Ha ha ! What a mistake ! My goodness me , how clever they think us ! ’
4840	4846	4848	4848	Trotty	20	‘ Yes , my dear , ’
4850	4867	4848	4848	Trotty	20	‘ and they ’d be very fond of any one of us that _ did _ know ’em
4898	4899	4900	4900	He	133	’ ‘
4919	4925	4910	4910	he	133	’ said Meg , cheerfully . ‘
4981	4982	4989	4990	my Pet	142	’ ‘
4992	4996	4989	4990	my Pet	142	’ said Trotty . ‘
5026	5032	5039	5039	Meg	25	’re rheumatic in the damp . ’
5033	5037	5039	5039	Meg	25	‘ Then here , ’
5051	5070	5039	5039	Meg	25	‘ here it is , all ready ! And beautiful it looks ! Come , father . Come ! ’
5193	5196	5198	5198	Trotty	20	‘ Amen ! ’
5210	5218	5220	5220	Meg	25	‘ Amen to the Bells , father ? ’
5222	5233	5235	5235	Trotty	20	‘ They broke in like a grace , my dear , ’
5241	5267	5235	5235	Trotty	20	‘ They ’d say a good one , I am sure , if they could . Many ’s the kind thing they say to me . ’
5268	5275	5277	5277	Meg	25	‘ The Bells do , father ! ’
5294	5297	5280	5280	she	25	‘ Well ! ’
5298	5305	5307	5307	Trotty	20	‘ Seem to , my Pet , ’
5315	5325	5307	5307	Trotty	20	‘ And where ’s the difference ? If I hear ’em
5345	5367	5340	5340	you	25	’ said Toby , pointing at the tower with his fork , and becoming more animated under the influence of dinner , ‘
5411	5412	5373	5373	them	144	’ ‘
5418	5440	5373	5373	them	144	’ cried Meg . She had , though — over and over again . For it was Toby ’s constant topic . ‘
5447	5451	5456	5456	I	0	’ said Trotty ; ‘
5496	5497	5490	5490	Toby	19	’ ‘
5507	5521	5505	5505	father	860	’ said Meg , with a touch of sadness in her pleasant voice . ‘
5524	5530	5505	5505	father	860	’ answered the unconscious Toby . ‘
5534	5655	5505	5505	father	860	’ While this discourse was holding , Trotty made no pause in his attack upon the savoury meat before him , but cut and ate , and cut and drank , and cut and chewed , and dodged about , from tripe to hot potato , and from hot potato back again to tripe , with an unctuous and unflagging relish . But happening now to look all round the street — in case anybody should be beckoning from any door or window , for a porter — his eyes , in coming back again , encountered Meg : sitting opposite to him , with her arms folded and only busy in watching his progress with a smile of happiness . ‘
5662	5672	5658	5658	Lord	147	’ said Trotty , dropping his knife and fork . ‘
5690	5691	5692	5692	Father	31	’ ‘
5694	5695	5692	5692	Father	31	’ ‘
5699	5707	5692	5692	Father	31	’ said Trotty , in penitent explanation , ‘
5738	5739	5718	5718	you	25	’ ‘
5748	5755	5741	5741	I	0	’ interposed his daughter , laughing , ‘
5766	5767	5760	5760	I	0	’ ‘
5770	5774	5760	5760	I	0	’ said Trotty . ‘
5818	5819	5820	5820	I	0	’ ‘
5832	5841	5826	5826	father	860	’ said Meg , coming nearer to him . ‘
5875	5949	5950	5950	I	0	’ Toby still appeared incredulous ; but she looked into his face with her clear eyes , and laying her hand upon his shoulder , motioned him to go on while the meat was hot . So Trotty took up his knife and fork again , and went to work . But much more slowly than before , and shaking his head , as if he were not at all pleased with himself . ‘
5957	5966	5955	5955	father	860	’ said Meg , after a little hesitation , ‘
6003	6019	6001	6001	father	860	’ Trotty took a little beer , and smacked his lips . Then he said , ‘
6024	6031	6032	6032	Meg	25	‘ And Richard says , father — ’
6038	6046	6048	6048	Toby	19	‘ What does Richard say , Meg ? ’
6050	6056	6048	6048	Toby	19	‘ Richard says , father — ’
6060	6069	6071	6071	Toby	19	‘ Richard ’s a long time saying it , ’
6073	6080	6081	6081	Meg	25	‘ He says then , father , ’
6101	6208	6081	6081	Meg	25	‘ another year is nearly gone , and where is the use of waiting on from year to year , when it is so unlikely we shall ever be better off than we are now ? He says we are poor now , father , and we shall be poor then , but we are young now , and years will make us old before we know it . He says that if we wait : people in our condition : until we see our way quite clearly , the way will be a narrow one indeed — the common way — the Grave , father . ’
6233	6360	6228	6228	Trotty	20	‘ And how hard , father , to grow old , and die , and think we might have cheered and helped each other ! How hard in all our lives to love each other ; and to grieve , apart , to see each other working , changing , growing old and grey . Even if I got the better of it , and forgot him ( which I never could ) , oh father dear , how hard to have a heart so full as mine is now , and live to have it slowly drained out every drop , without the recollection of one happy moment of a woman ’s life , to stay behind and comfort me , and make me better ! ’
6399	6635	6368	6368	her	25	‘ So Richard says , father ; as his work was yesterday made certain for some time to come , and as I love him , and have loved him full three years — ah ! longer than that , if he knew it!—will I marry him on New Year ’s Day ; the best and happiest day , he says , in the whole year , and one that is almost sure to bring good fortune with it . It ’s a short notice , father — isn’t it?—but I have n’t my fortune to be settled , or my wedding dresses to be made , like the great ladies , father , have I ? And he said so much , and said it in his way ; so strong and earnest , and all the time so kind and gentle ; that I said I ’d come and talk to you , father . And as they paid the money for that work of mine this morning ( unexpectedly , I am sure ! ) and as you have fared very poorly for a whole week , and as I could n’t help wishing there should be something to make this day a sort of holiday to you as well as a dear and happy day to me , father , I made a little treat and brought it to surprise you . ’
6636	6648	6368	6368	her	25	‘ And see how he leaves it cooling on the step ! ’
6754	6765	6767	6767	Richard	32	‘ See how he leaves it cooling on the step ! ’
6769	6781	6767	6767	Richard	32	‘ Meg do n’t know what he likes . Not she ! ’
6829	6887	6818	6819	a footman	160	‘ Out of the vays here , will you ! You must always go and be a - settin on our steps , must you ! You ca n’t go and give a turn to none of the neighbours never , ca n’t you ! _ Will _ you clear the road , or wo n’t you ? ’
6904	6915	6917	6924	the gentleman for whom the door was opened	162	‘ What ’s the matter , what ’s the matter ! ’
7008	7019	7024	7026	a - being	166	‘ What ’s the matter ! What ’s the matter ! ’
7020	7022	7024	7026	a - being	166	‘ You ’re
7039	7050	7062	7062	you	167	’ said the footman with great emphasis to Trotty Veck , ‘
7064	7070	7062	7062	you	167	’em be ? CAN’T you let ’em
7073	7074	7062	7062	you	167	’ ‘
7085	7090	7062	7062	you	167	’ said the gentleman . ‘
7096	7105	7094	7094	Porter	168	’ beckoning with his head to Trotty Veck . ‘
7116	7117	7120	7120	sir	169	’ ‘
7122	7134	7120	7120	sir	169	’ said Trotty , leaving it behind him in a corner . ‘
7141	7146	7120	7120	sir	169	’ exclaimed the gentleman . ‘
7165	7166	7169	7169	sir	169	’ ‘
7171	7431	7169	7169	sir	169	’ repeated Trotty , looking with a fixed eye and a watery mouth , at the piece of tripe he had reserved for a last delicious tit - bit ; which the gentleman was now turning over and over on the end of the fork . Two other gentlemen had come out with him . One was a low - spirited gentleman of middle age , of a meagre habit , and a disconsolate face ; who kept his hands continually in the pockets of his scanty pepper - and - salt trousers , very large and dog’s - eared from that custom ; and was not particularly well brushed or washed . The other , a full - sized , sleek , well - conditioned gentleman , in a blue coat with bright buttons , and a white cravat . This gentleman had a very red face , as if an undue proportion of the blood in his body were squeezed up into his head ; which perhaps accounted for his having also the appearance of being rather cold about the heart . He who had Toby ’s meat upon the fork , called to the first one by the name of Filer ; and they both drew near together . Mr. Filer being exceedingly short - sighted , was obliged to go so close to the remnant of Toby ’s dinner before he could make out what it was , that Toby ’s heart leaped up into his mouth . But Mr. Filer did n’t eat it . ‘
7442	7457	7169	7169	sir	169	’ said Filer , making little punches in it with a pencil - case , ‘
7474	7532	7169	7169	sir	169	’ The Alderman laughed , and winked ; for he was a merry fellow , Alderman Cute . Oh , and a sly fellow too ! A knowing fellow . Up to everything . Not to be imposed upon . Deep in the people ’s hearts ! He knew them , Cute did . I believe you ! ‘
7538	7546	7169	7169	sir	169	’ said Mr. Filer , looking round . ‘
7709	7737	7781	7781	You	0	’ Trotty stood aghast , and his legs shook under him . He seemed to have starved a garrison of five hundred men with his own hand . ‘
7742	7749	7781	7781	You	0	’ said Mr. Filer , warmly . ‘
7754	7761	7766	7766	you	0	’ Trotty made a miserable bow . ‘
7768	7773	7766	7766	you	0	’ said Mr. Filer . ‘
7798	7799	7781	7781	You	0	’ ‘
7806	7812	7781	7781	You	0	’ said Trotty , faintly . ‘
7820	7821	7831	7831	Alderman	181	’ ‘
7833	7838	7831	7831	Alderman	181	’ said Mr. Filer , ‘
7877	7910	7874	7875	a robber	185	’ Trotty was so shocked , that it gave him no concern to see the Alderman finish the tripe himself . It was a relief to get rid of it , anyhow . ‘
7917	7935	7914	7914	you	181	’ asked the Alderman , jocosely , of the red - faced gentleman in the blue coat . ‘
7949	7950	7945	7945	you	181	’ ‘
7958	7963	7945	7945	you	181	’ returned the gentleman . ‘
7983	7987	7945	7945	you	181	’ meaning Trotty ; ‘
8060	8068	8141	8141	They	189	’ sighed the red - faced gentleman . ‘
8079	8119	8141	8141	They	189	’ The gentleman did n’t specify what particular times he alluded to ; nor did he say whether he objected to the present times , from a disinterested consciousness that they had done nothing very remarkable in producing himself . ‘
8130	8135	8141	8141	They	189	’ repeated the gentleman . ‘
8209	8210	8211	8211	He	885	’ ‘
8251	8256	8257	8257	I	0	’ said Mr. Filer . ‘
8265	8427	8257	8257	I	0	’ But still the red - faced gentleman extolled the good old times , the grand old times , the great old times . No matter what anybody else said , he still went turning round and round in one set form of words concerning them ; as a poor squirrel turns and turns in its revolving cage ; touching the mechanism , and trick of which , it has probably quite as distinct perceptions , as ever this red - faced gentleman had of his deceased Millennium . It is possible that poor Trotty ’s faith in these very vague Old Times was not entirely destroyed , for he felt vague enough at that moment . One thing , however , was plain to him , in the midst of his distress ; to wit , that however these gentlemen might differ in details , his misgivings of that morning , and of many other mornings , were well founded . ‘
8441	8447	8432	8432	We	192	’ thought Trotty in despair . ‘
8460	8510	8455	8455	We	192	’ But Trotty had a father ’s heart within him ; which had somehow got into his breast in spite of this decree ; and he could not bear that Meg , in the blush of her brief joy , should have her fortune read by these wise gentlemen . ‘
8515	8520	8513	8513	her	193	’ thought poor Trotty . ‘
8528	8621	8521	8521	She	193	’ He anxiously signed , therefore , to the young smith , to take her away . But he was so busy , talking to her softly at a little distance , that he only became conscious of this desire , simultaneously with Alderman Cute . Now , the Alderman had not yet had his say , but _ he _ was a philosopher , too — practical , though ! Oh , very practical — and , as he had no idea of losing any portion of his audience , he cried ‘
8624	8625	8521	8521	She	193	’ ‘
8631	8656	8628	8628	you	194	’ said the Alderman , addressing his two friends , with a self - complacent smile upon his face which was habitual to him , ‘
8703	8709	8717	8717	you	194	’em , and can talk to ’em
8801	8812	8797	8797	Lord	200	’ said the Alderman , turning to his friends again , ‘
8831	8833	8834	8839	Famous man for the common people	203	’em . ’
8860	8867	8869	8870	the Alderman	926	‘ You see , my friend , ’
8872	8939	8941	8942	the Alderman	926	‘ there ’s a great deal of nonsense talked about Want—“hard up , ” you know ; that ’s the phrase , is n’t it ? ha ! ha ! ha!—and I intend to Put it Down . There ’s a certain amount of ca nt in vogue about Starvation , and I mean to Put it Down . That ’s all ! Lord bless you , ’
8950	8973	8941	8942	the Alderman	926	‘ you may Put Down anything among this sort of people , if you only know the way to set about it . ’
8998	9004	9006	9007	the Alderman	926	‘ Your daughter , eh ? ’
9037	9043	9045	9047	that worthy gentleman	211	‘ Where ’s her mother ? ’
9049	9052	9054	9054	Toby	19	‘ Dead , ’
9056	9073	9054	9054	Toby	19	‘ Her mother got up linen ; and was called to Heaven when She was born . ’
9074	9087	9089	9090	the Alderman	926	‘ Not to get up linen _ there _ , I suppose , ’
9139	9142	9149	9149	you	211	‘ And you ’re
9151	9159	9149	9149	you	211	’ said Cute to the young smith . ‘
9162	9175	9149	9149	you	211	’ returned Richard quickly , for he was nettled by the question . ‘
9189	9190	9193	9193	you	211	’ ‘
9196	9201	9193	9193	you	211	’ cried Filer sharply . ‘
9204	9205	9193	9193	you	211	’ ‘
9211	9218	9220	9220	Richard	32	’re thinking of it , Master , ’
9222	9224	9220	9220	Richard	32	‘ We ’re
9242	9243	9262	9262	Alderman	181	’ ‘
9246	9254	9262	9262	Alderman	181	’ cried Filer , with a groan . ‘
9314	9339	9312	9312	you	181	’ Well ? They were worth looking at . And marriage seemed as reasonable and fair a deed as they need have in contemplation . ‘
9351	9356	9340	9341	A man	219	’ said Mr. Filer , ‘
9401	9419	9394	9394	he	219	’em that they have no right or business to be married , than he can hope to persuade ’em
9452	9481	9486	9486	you	222	’ Alderman Cute was mightily diverted , and laid his right forefinger on the side of his nose , as much as to say to both his friends , ‘
9500	9507	9509	9510	Alderman Cute	40	‘ Come here , my girl ! ’
9586	9590	9562	9562	Trotty	20	‘ Now , I ’m
9606	9617	9562	9562	Trotty	20	’ said the Alderman , in his nice easy way . ‘
9631	9638	9644	9644	you	25	’m a Justice . You know I ’m
9646	9651	9644	9644	you	25	’ Meg timidly said , ‘
9654	9687	9644	9644	you	25	’ But everybody knew Alderman Cute was a Justice ! Oh dear , so active a Justice always ! Who such a mote of brightness in the public eye , as Cute ! ‘
9698	9703	9695	9695	you	25	’ pursued the Alderman . ‘
9821	9955	9818	9818	I	0	’em summarily , every one , for I am determined to Put boys without shoes and stockings , Down . Perhaps your husband will die young ( most likely ) and leave you with a baby . Then you ’ll be turned out of doors , and wander up and down the streets . Now , do n’t wander near me , my dear , for I am resolved , to Put all wandering mothers Down . All young mothers , of all sorts and kinds , it ’s my determination to Put Down . Do n’t think to plead illness as an excuse with me ; or babies as an excuse with me ; for all sick persons and young children ( I hope you know the church - service , but I ’m
10018	10030	10033	10033	I	0	’ said the Alderman , with his self - satisfied smile , ‘
10081	10109	10078	10079	each other	894	’ Toby knew not whether to be agonised or glad , to see that Meg had turned a deadly white , and dropped her lover ’s hand . ‘
10119	10136	10115	10115	you	236	’ said the Alderman , turning with even increased cheerfulness and urbanity to the young smith , ‘
10201	10236	10239	10239	he	236	’re a middle - aged man ! And a pretty figure you ’ll cut then , with a draggle - tailed wife and a crowd of squalling children crying after you wherever you go ! ’
10251	10259	10261	10262	the Alderman	926	‘ There ! Go along with you , ’
10264	10324	10261	10262	the Alderman	926	‘ and repent . Do n’t make such a fool of yourself as to get married on New Year ’s Day . You ’ll think very differently of it , long before next New Year ’s Day : a trim young fellow like you , with all the girls looking after you . There ! Go along with you ! ’
10397	10405	10407	10408	the Alderman	926	‘ As you happen to be here , ’
10412	10427	10428	10430	an old man	249	‘ you shall carry a letter for me . Can you be quick ? You ’re
10432	10460	10428	10430	an old man	249	’ Toby , who had been looking after Meg , quite stupidly , made shift to murmur out that he was very quick , and very strong . ‘
10466	10471	10472	10472	I	0	’ inquired the Alderman . ‘
10473	10479	10481	10481	Toby	19	’m over sixty , sir , ’
10483	10500	10502	10503	Mr. Filer	34	‘ O ! This man ’s a great deal past the average age , you know , ’
10526	10530	10502	10503	Mr. Filer	34	‘ I feel I ’m
10535	10539	10540	10540	I	0	’ said Toby . ‘
10552	10651	10652	10652	Porter	38	’ The Alderman cut him short by giving him the letter from his pocket . Toby would have got a shilling too ; but Mr. Filer clearly showing that in that case he would rob a certain given number of persons of ninepence - halfpenny a - piece , he only got sixpence ; and thought himself very well off to get that . Then the Alderman gave an arm to each of his friends , and walked off in high feather ; but , he immediately came hurrying back alone , as if he had forgotten something . ‘
10654	10659	10660	10660	Sir	169	’ said the Alderman . ‘
10662	10666	10660	10660	Sir	169	’ said Toby . ‘
10681	10682	10675	10675	She	252	’ ‘
10697	10715	10690	10690	somebody	253	’ thought Toby , looking at the sixpence in his hand , and thinking of the tripe . ‘
10741	10742	10743	10743	She	252	’ ‘
10752	10757	10743	10743	She	252	’ repeated the Alderman . ‘
10784	10793	10776	10776	I	0	’ With which , he hurried off again . ‘
10802	10810	10776	10776	I	0	’ said Trotty , clasping his hands . ‘
10818	10850	10776	10776	I	0	’ The Chimes came clashing in upon him as he said the words . Full , loud , and sounding — but with no encouragement . No , not a drop . ‘
10856	10866	10776	10776	I	0	’ cried the old man , as he listened . ‘
10903	10920	11225	11225	Toby	19	’ Still the Bells , pealing forth their changes , made the very air spin . Put ’em
10924	10944	11225	11225	Toby	19	’em down ! Good old Times , Good old Times ! Facts and Figures , Facts and Figures ! Put ’em
10948	11080	11225	11225	Toby	19	’em down ! If they said anything they said this , until the brain of Toby reeled . He pressed his bewildered head between his hands , as if to keep it from splitting asunder . A well - timed action , as it happened ; for finding the letter in one of them , and being by that means reminded of his charge , he fell , mechanically , into his usual trot , and trotted off . CHAPTER II — The Second Quarter . The letter Toby had received from Alderman Cute , was addressed to a great man in the great district of the town . The greatest district of the town . It must have been the greatest district of the town , because it was commonly called ‘
11083	11146	11225	11225	Toby	19	’ by its inhabitants . The letter positively seemed heavier in Toby ’s hand , than another letter . Not because the Alderman had sealed it with a very large coat of arms and no end of wax , but because of the weighty name on the superscription , and the ponderous amount of gold and silver with which it was associated . ‘
11152	11169	11225	11225	Toby	19	’ thought Toby , in all simplicity and earnestness , as he looked at the direction . ‘
11188	11213	11225	11225	Toby	19	’em ; and whose share does he take but his own ! As to snatching tripe from anybody ’s mouth — he’d scorn it ! ’
11239	11243	11245	11245	Trotty	20	‘ His children , ’
11255	11286	11245	11245	Trotty	20	‘ his daughters — Gentlemen may win their hearts and marry them ; they may be happy wives and mothers ; they may be handsome like my darling M - e- ’
11311	11315	11317	11317	Trotty	20	‘ Never mind , ’
11319	11334	11317	11317	Trotty	20	‘ I know what I mean . That ’s more than enough for me . ’
11793	11795	11776	11776	Trotty	20	‘ Put ’em
11799	11819	11776	11776	Trotty	20	’em down ! Facts and Figures , Facts and Figures ! Good old Times , Good old Times ! Put ’em
11823	11984	11776	11776	Trotty	20	’em down!’—his trot went to that measure , and would fit itself to nothing else . But , even that one , melancholy as it was , brought him , in due time , to the end of his journey . To the mansion of Sir Joseph Bowley , Member of Parliament . The door was opened by a Porter . Such a Porter ! Not of Toby ’s order . Quite another thing . His place was the ticket though ; not Toby ’s . This Porter underwent some hard panting before he could speak ; having breathed himself by coming incautiously out of his chair , without first taking time to think about it and compose his mind . When he had found his voice — which it took him a long time to do , for it was a long way off , and hidden under a load of meat — he said in a fat whisper , ‘
11990	11995	11996	11996	You	273	’ Toby told him . ‘
11997	12005	12007	12008	the Porter	274	’re to take it in , yourself , ’
12027	12041	12007	12008	the Porter	274	‘ Everything goes straight in , on this day of the year . You ’re
12071	12074	12075	12075	Toby	19	’ purpose . ’
12244	12249	12251	12255	the last - named gentleman	288	‘ What is this ? ’
12257	12269	12251	12255	the last - named gentleman	288	‘ Mr. Fish , will you have the goodness to attend ? ’
12289	12297	12251	12255	the last - named gentleman	288	‘ From Alderman Cute , Sir Joseph . ’
12298	12310	12312	12313	Sir Joseph	42	‘ Is this all ? Have you nothing else , Porter ? ’
12321	12349	12351	12352	Sir Joseph	42	‘ You have no bill or demand upon me — my name is Bowley , Sir Joseph Bowley — of any kind from anybody , have you ? ’
12354	12412	12351	12352	Sir Joseph	42	‘ If you have , present it . There is a cheque - book by the side of Mr. Fish . I allow nothing to be carried into the New Year . Every description of account is settled in this house at the close of the old one . So that if death was to — to — ’
12413	12417	12419	12420	Mr. Fish	43	‘ To cut , ’
12422	12428	12419	12420	Mr. Fish	43	‘ To sever , sir , ’
12437	12458	12430	12431	Sir Joseph	42	‘ the cord of existence — my affairs would be found , I hope , in a state of preparation . ’
12459	12465	12467	12468	the lady	289	‘ My dear Sir Joseph ! ’
12478	12482	12467	12468	the lady	289	‘ How shocking ! ’
12483	12488	12490	12491	Sir Joseph	42	‘ My lady Bowley , ’
12507	12563	12490	12491	Sir Joseph	42	‘ at this season of the year we should think of — of — ourselves . We should look into our — our accounts . We should feel that every return of so eventful a period in human transactions , involves a matter of deep moment between a man and his — and his banker . ’
12629	12641	12643	12644	Sir Joseph	42	‘ You were desiring Mr. Fish to say , my lady — ’
12646	12656	12658	12659	his lady	291	‘ Mr. Fish has said that , I believe , ’
12666	12694	12658	12659	his lady	291	‘ But , upon my word , Sir Joseph , I do n’t think I can let it go after all . It is so very dear . ’
12695	12700	12702	12703	Sir Joseph	42	‘ What is dear ? ’
12705	12727	12702	12703	Sir Joseph	42	‘ That Charity , my love . They only allow two votes for a subscription of five pounds . Really monstrous ! ’
12728	12733	12735	12736	Sir Joseph	42	‘ My lady Bowley , ’
12738	12806	12735	12736	Sir Joseph	42	‘ you surprise me . Is the luxury of feeling in proportion to the number of votes ; or is it , to a rightly constituted mind , in proportion to the number of applicants , and the wholesome state of mind to which their canvassing reduces them ? Is there no excitement of the purest kind in having two votes to dispose of among fifty people ? ’
12807	12815	12817	12818	the lady	289	‘ Not to me , I acknowledge , ’
12820	12854	12817	12818	the lady	289	‘ It bores one . Besides , one ca n’t oblige one ’s acquaintance . But you are the Poor Man ’s Friend , you know , Sir Joseph . You think otherwise . ’
12855	12866	12868	12869	Sir Joseph	42	‘ I _ am _ the Poor Man ’s Friend , ’
12878	12900	12868	12869	Sir Joseph	42	‘ As such I may be taunted . As such I have been taunted . But I ask no other title . ’
12901	12909	12911	12911	Trotty	20	‘ Bless him for a noble gentleman ! ’
12913	12925	12927	12928	Sir Joseph	42	‘ I do n’t agree with Cute here , for instance , ’
12935	13043	12927	12928	Sir Joseph	42	‘ I do n’t agree with the Filer party . I do n’t agree with any party . My friend the Poor Man , has no business with anything of that sort , and nothing of that sort has any business with him . My friend the Poor Man , in my district , is my business . No man or body of men has any right to interfere between my friend and me . That is the ground I take . I assume a — a paternal character towards my friend . I say , “ My good fellow , I will treat you paternally . ” ’
13057	13066	13068	13069	Sir Joseph	42	‘ Your only business , my good fellow , ’
13076	13162	13068	13069	Sir Joseph	42	‘ your only business in life is with me . You need n’t trouble yourself to think about anything . I will think for you ; I know what is good for you ; I am your perpetual parent . Such is the dispensation of an all - wise Providence ! Now , the design of your creation is — not that you should swill , and guzzle , and associate your enjoyments , brutally , with food ; Toby thought remorsefully of the tripe ; ‘
13269	13270	13257	13257	you	294	’ ‘
13279	13288	13271	13272	Nice children	299	’ said the lady , with a shudder . ‘
13307	13308	13309	13310	My lady	1032	’ ‘
13312	13320	13309	13310	My lady	1032	’ returned Sir Joseph , with solemnity , ‘
13464	13470	13452	13453	a Father	939	’ Toby was greatly moved . ‘
13482	13487	13488	13489	My lady	1032	’ cried his wife . ‘
13491	13499	13488	13489	My lady	1032	’ said Sir Joseph , quite majestically , ‘
13517	13518	13511	13511	I	0	’ ‘
13524	13528	13511	13511	I	0	’ thought Toby . ‘
13533	13534	13511	13511	I	0	’ ‘

13660	13677	13696	13697	the Alderman	926	’ With that great sentiment , he opened the Alderman ’s letter ; and read it . ‘
13687	13692	13693	13694	My lady	1032	’ exclaimed Sir Joseph . ‘
13754	13755	13750	13750	Fern	45	’ ‘
13761	13767	13768	13772	The worst man among them	330	’ replied my Lady Bowley . ‘
13784	13785	13781	13781	I	0	’ ‘
13789	13793	13781	13781	I	0	’ said Sir Joseph ’
13800	13902	13781	13781	I	0	‘ Not quite . Very near . Not quite . He came up to London , it seems , to look for employment ( trying to better himself — that ’s his story ) , and being found at night asleep in a shed , was taken into custody , and carried next morning before the Alderman . The Alderman observes ( very properly ) that he is determined to put this sort of thing down ; and that if it will be agreeable to me to have Will Fern put down , he will be happy to begin with him . ’
13903	13916	13918	13919	the lady	289	‘ Let him be made an example of , by all means , ’
13921	14075	13918	13919	the lady	289	‘ Last winter , when I introduced pinking and eyelet - holing among the men and boys in the village , as a nice evening employment , and had the lines , O let us love our occupations , Bless the squire and his relations , Live upon our daily rations , And always know our proper stations , set to music on the new system , for them to sing the while ; this very Fern — I see him now — touched that hat of his , and said , “ I humbly ask your pardon , my lady , but _ an’t _ I something different from a great girl ? ” I expected it , of course ; who can expect anything but insolence and ingratitude from that class of people ! That is not to the purpose , however . Sir Joseph ! Make an example of him ! ’
14076	14079	14081	14082	Sir Joseph	42	‘ Hem ! ’
14084	14097	14081	14082	Sir Joseph	42	‘ Mr. Fish , if you ’ll have the goodness to attend — ’
14113	14340	14098	14099	Mr. Fish	43	‘ Private . My dear Sir . I am very much indebted to you for your courtesy in the matter of the man William Fern , of whom , I regret to add , I can say nothing favourable . I have uniformly considered myself in the light of his Friend and Father , but have been repaid ( a common case , I grieve to say ) with ingratitude , and constant opposition to my plans . He is a turbulent and rebellious spirit . His character will not bear investigation . Nothing will persuade him to be happy when he might . Under these circumstances , it appears to me , I own , that when he comes before you again ( as you informed me he promised to do to - morrow , pending your inquiries , and I think he may be so far relied upon ) , his committal for some short term as a Vagabond , would be a service to society , and would be a salutary example in a country where — for the sake of those who are , through good and evil report , the Friends and Fathers of the Poor , as well as with a view to that , generally speaking , misguided class themselves — examples are greatly needed . And I am , ’
14345	14349	14351	14352	Sir Joseph	42	‘ It appears , ’
14367	14398	14361	14362	Mr. Fish	43	‘ as if this were Ordained : really . At the close of the year , I wind up my account and strike my balance , even with William Fern ! ’
14425	14432	14434	14435	Sir Joseph	42	‘ With my compliments and thanks , ’
14437	14440	14434	14435	Sir Joseph	42	‘ Stop ! ’
14441	14444	14446	14447	Mr. Fish	43	‘ Stop ! ’
14449	14456	14458	14459	Sir Joseph	42	‘ You have heard , perhaps , ’
14463	14589	14458	14459	Sir Joseph	42	‘ certain remarks into which I have been led respecting the solemn period of time at which we have arrived , and the duty imposed upon us of settling our affairs , and being prepared . You have observed that I do n’t shelter myself behind my superior standing in society , but that Mr. Fish — that gentleman — has a cheque - book at his elbow , and is in fact here , to enable me to turn over a perfectly new leaf , and enter on the epoch before us with a clean account . Now , my friend , can you lay your hand upon your heart , and say , that you also have made preparations for a New Year ? ’
14590	14597	14599	14599	Trotty	20	‘ I am afraid , sir , ’
14606	14622	14599	14599	Trotty	20	‘ that I am a — a — little behind - hand with the world . ’
14623	14631	14633	14635	Sir Joseph Bowley	42	‘ Behind - hand with the world ! ’
14644	14651	14653	14653	Trotty	20	‘ I am afraid , sir , ’
14655	14671	14653	14653	Trotty	20	‘ that there ’s a matter of ten or twelve shillings owing to Mrs. Chickenstalker . ’
14672	14677	14679	14680	Sir Joseph	42	‘ To Mrs. Chickenstalker ! ’
14689	14695	14697	14697	Toby	19	‘ A shop , sir , ’
14699	14743	14697	14697	Toby	19	‘ in the general line . Also a — a little money on account of rent . A very little , sir . It ought n’t to be owing , I know , but we have been hard put to it , indeed ! ’
14789	14850	14851	14851	he	42	‘ How a man , even among this improvident and impracticable race ; an old man ; a man grown grey ; can look a New Year in the face , with his affairs in this condition ; how he can lie down on his bed at night , and get up again in the morning , and — There ! ’
14860	14869	14851	14851	he	42	‘ Take the letter . Take the letter ! ’
14870	14880	14882	14882	Trotty	20	‘ I heartily wish it was otherwise , sir , ’
14889	14897	14882	14882	Trotty	20	‘ We have been tried very hard . ’
14902	14911	14913	14914	Mr. Fish	43	‘ Take the letter , take the letter ! ’
15107	15116	15105	15105	them	340	‘ Friends and Fathers , Friends and Fathers , ’
15194	15201	15175	15175	he	19	‘ I beg your pardon , I ’m
15204	15236	15237	15237	I	0	’ said Trotty , pulling up his hat in great confusion , and between the hat and the torn lining , fixing his head into a kind of bee - hive . ‘
15245	15313	15314	15314	I	0	’ As to hurting anybody , Toby was not such an absolute Samson , but that he was much more likely to be hurt himself : and indeed , he had flown out into the road , like a shuttlecock . He had such an opinion of his own strength , however , that he was in real concern for the other party : and said again , ‘
15322	15380	15383	15383	friend	344	’ The man against whom he had run ; a sun - browned , sinewy , country - looking man , with grizzled hair , and a rough chin ; stared at him for a moment , as if he suspected him to be in jest . But , satisfied of his good faith , he answered : ‘
15391	15392	15385	15385	You	344	’ ‘
15400	15404	15406	15407	the child	345	’ said Trotty . ‘
15409	15414	15406	15407	the child	345	’ returned the man . ‘
15420	15468	15415	15415	I	0	’ As he said so , he glanced at a little girl he carried in his arms , asleep : and shading her face with the long end of the poor handkerchief he wore about his throat , went slowly on . The tone in which he said ‘
15474	15651	15471	15471	you	0	’ penetrated Trotty ’s heart . He was so jaded and foot - sore , and so soiled with travel , and looked about him so forlorn and strange , that it was a comfort to him to be able to thank any one : no matter for how little . Toby stood gazing after him as he plodded wearily away , with the child ’s arm clinging round his neck . At the figure in the worn shoes — now the very shade and ghost of shoes — rough leather leggings , common frock , and broad slouched hat , Trotty stood gazing , blind to the whole street . And at the child ’s arm , clinging round its neck . Before he merged into the darkness the traveller stopped ; and looking round , and seeing Trotty standing there yet , seemed undecided whether to return or go on . After doing first the one and then the other , he came back , and Trotty went half - way to meet him . ‘
15659	15668	15671	15671	you	347	’ said the man with a faint smile , ‘
15693	15694	15689	15690	Alderman Cute	40	’ ‘
15699	15703	15689	15690	Alderman Cute	40	’ replied Toby . ‘
15713	15714	15704	15704	I	0	’ ‘
15727	15735	15715	15715	I	0	’ said the man , accompanying Toby , ‘
15738	15781	15715	15715	I	0	’m uneasy under suspicion , and want to clear myself , and to be free to go and seek my bread — I do n’t know where . So , maybe he ’ll forgive my going to his house to - night . ’
15782	15787	15789	15789	Toby	19	‘ It ’s impossible , ’
15794	15801	15789	15789	Toby	19	‘ that your name ’s Fern ! ’
15802	15805	15807	15808	the other	349	‘ Eh ! ’
15816	15822	15824	15824	Trotty	20	‘ Fern ! Will Fern ! ’
15826	15832	15834	15835	the other	349	‘ That ’s my name , ’
15837	15841	15843	15843	Trotty	20	‘ Why then , ’
15856	15910	15843	15843	Trotty	20	‘ for Heaven ’s sake do n’t go to him ! Do n’t go to him ! He ’ll put you down as sure as ever you were born . Here ! come up this alley , and I ’ll tell you what I mean . Do n’t go to _ him _ . ’
16048	16057	16058	16058	he	19	‘ It ’s true enough in the main , ’
16061	16079	16058	16058	he	19	‘ master , I could sift grain from husk here and there , but let it be as ’
16095	16306	16058	16058	he	19	’ . I ca n’t help it ; I should do the like to - morrow . As to character , them gentlefolks will search and search , and pry and pry , and have it as free from spot or speck in us , afore they ’ll help us to a dry good word!—Well ! I hope they do n’t lose good opinion as easy as we do , or their lives is strict indeed , and hardly worth the keeping . For myself , master , I never took with that hand’—holding it before him—‘what was n’t my own ; and never held it back from work , however hard , or poorly paid . Whoever can deny it , let him chop it off ! But when work wo n’t maintain me like a human creetur ; when my living is so bad , that I am Hungry , out of doors and in ; when I see a whole working life begin that way , go on that way , and end that way , without a chance or change ; then I say to the gentlefolks “ Keep away from me ! Let my cottage be . My doors is dark enough without your darkening of ’em
16351	16355	16366	16366	I	0	’em , and enjoy ’em
16367	16373	16366	16366	I	0	’m best let alone ! ” ’
16450	16452	16445	16445	he	0	‘ I ’m
16461	16471	16445	16445	he	0	’ , I believe ; and easy satisfied , I ’m
16483	16530	16445	16445	he	0	’em . I only want to live like one of the Almighty ’s creeturs . I can’t — I don’t — and so there ’s a pit dug between me , and them that can and do . There ’s others like me . You might tell ’em
16543	16562	16563	16563	I	0	’ Trotty knew he spoke the Truth in this , and shook his head to signify as much . ‘
16572	16576	16563	16563	I	0	’ said Fern ; ‘
16579	16584	16668	16668	his	360	’m not likely , I ’m
16592	16664	16668	16668	his	360	’ Tan’t lawful to be out of sorts , and I AM out of sorts , though God knows I ’d sooner bear a cheerful spirit if I could . Well ! I do n’t know as this Alderman could hurt _ me _ much by sending me to jail ; but without a friend to speak a word for me , he might do it ; and you see — ! ’
16675	16682	16684	16684	Trotty	20	‘ She has a beautiful face , ’
16686	16690	16692	16693	the other	349	‘ Why yes ! ’
16719	16785	16786	16786	He	360	‘ I ’ve thought so , many times . I ’ve thought so , when my hearth was very cold , and cupboard very bare . I thought so t’other night , when we were taken like two thieves . But they — they should n’t try the little face too often , should they , Lilian ? That ’s hardly fair upon a man ! ’
16823	16829	16830	16830	he	360	‘ I never had one , ’
16837	16916	16830	16830	he	360	‘ She ’s my brother ’s child : a orphan . Nine year old , though you ’d hardly think it ; but she ’s tired and worn out now . They ’d have taken care on her , the Union — eight - and - twenty mile away from where we live — between four walls ( as they took care of my old father when he could n’t work no more , though he did n’t trouble ’em
16980	17003	16978	16978	Lilly	51	’ Meeting the child ’s eyes with a smile which melted Toby more than tears , he shook him by the hand . ‘
17014	17018	16978	16978	Lilly	51	’ he said , ‘
17031	17052	17058	17058	Toby	19	’m thankful to you ; with good reason . I ’ll take your advice , and keep clear of this — ’
17053	17056	17058	17058	Toby	19	‘ Justice , ’
17060	17063	17064	17064	he	19	‘ Ah ! ’
17067	17091	17064	17064	he	19	‘ If that ’s the name they give him . This Justice . And to - morrow will try whether there ’s better fortun ’
17109	17110	17058	17058	Toby	19	’ ‘
17113	17128	17058	17058	Toby	19	’ cried Trotty , catching at his hand , as he relaxed his grip . ‘
17187	17224	17226	17226	Trotty	20	’m a poor man , living in a poor place ; but I can give you lodging for one night and never miss it . Come home with me ! Here ! I ’ll take her ! ’
17233	17265	17226	17226	Trotty	20	‘ A pretty one ! I ’d carry twenty times her weight , and never know I ’d got it . Tell me if I go too quick for you . I ’m
17273	17307	17269	17269	I	0	’ Trotty said this , taking about six of his trotting paces to one stride of his fatigued companion ; and with his thin legs quivering again , beneath the load he bore . ‘
17315	17346	17310	17310	she	345	’ said Trotty , trotting in his speech as well as in his gait ; for he could n’t bear to be thanked , and dreaded a moment ’s pause ; ‘
17489	17541	17484	17484	Meg	25	’ With which words Trotty , in a breathless state , set the child down before his daughter in the middle of the floor . The little visitor looked once at Meg ; and doubting nothing in that face , but trusting everything she saw there ; ran into her arms . ‘
17550	17563	17484	17484	Meg	25	’ cried Trotty , running round the room , and choking audibly . ‘
17621	17725	17728	17728	father	860	’ Trotty really had picked up the kettle somewhere or other in the course of his wild career and now put it on the fire : while Meg , seating the child in a warm corner , knelt down on the ground before her , and pulled off her shoes , and dried her wet feet on a cloth . Ay , and she laughed at Trotty too — so pleasantly , so cheerfully , that Trotty could have blessed her where she kneeled ; for he had seen that , when they entered , she was sitting by the fire in tears . ‘
17730	17734	17728	17728	father	860	’ said Meg . ‘
17736	17766	17728	17728	father	860	’re crazy to - night , I think . I do n’t know what the Bells would say to that . Poor little feet . How cold they are ! ’
17767	17771	17728	17728	father	860	‘ Oh , they ’re
17775	17780	17728	17728	father	860	’ exclaimed the child . ‘
17782	17787	17728	17728	father	860	’re quite warm now ! ’
17788	17795	17797	17797	Meg	25	‘ No , no , no , ’
17799	17804	17797	17797	Meg	25	‘ We have n’t rubbed ’em
17809	17819	17728	17728	father	860	’re so busy . So busy ! And when they ’re
17869	17896	17898	17898	Meg	25	’ The child , in a burst of sobbing , clasped her round the neck ; caressed her fair cheek with its hand ; and said , ‘
17904	17919	17898	17898	Meg	25	’ Toby ’s blessing could have done no more . Who could do more ! ‘
17924	17932	17898	17898	Meg	25	’ cried Meg , after a pause . ‘
17944	17948	17898	17898	Meg	25	’ said Trotty . ‘
17953	17957	17898	17898	Meg	25	’ cried Meg . ‘
17982	17983	17962	17962	He	860	’ ‘
17996	18005	18006	18006	Meg	25	’ said Trotty , hastily repairing this mistake . ‘
18011	18047	18006	18006	Meg	25	’ Meg looked towards him and saw that he had elaborately stationed himself behind the chair of their male visitor , where with many mysterious gestures he was holding up the sixpence he had earned . ‘
18054	18058	18006	18006	Meg	25	’ said Trotty , ‘
18078	18107	18077	18077	I	0	’m pretty sure there was a bit of bacon too . As I do n’t remember where it was exactly , I ’ll go myself and try to find ’em
18109	18157	18077	18077	I	0	’ With this inscrutable artifice , Toby withdrew to purchase the viands he had spoken of , for ready money , at Mrs. Chickenstalker ’s ; and presently came back , pretending he had not been able to find them , at first , in the dark . ‘
18165	18176	18160	18160	they	392	’ said Trotty , setting out the tea - things , ‘
18230	18248	18259	18259	I	0	’ said Trotty , proceeding in his cookery , with the assistance of the toasting - fork , ‘
18279	18281	18283	18283	Trotty	20	’em , ’
18297	18306	18283	18283	Trotty	20	‘ but to me , as food , they ’re
18309	18537	18283	18283	Trotty	20	’ Yet Trotty sniffed the savour of the hissing bacon — ah!—as if he liked it ; and when he poured the boiling water in the tea - pot , looked lovingly down into the depths of that snug cauldron , and suffered the fragrant steam to curl about his nose , and wreathe his head and face in a thick cloud . However , for all this , he neither ate nor drank , except at the very beginning , a mere morsel for form ’s sake , which he appeared to eat with infinite relish , but declared was perfectly uninteresting to him . No . Trotty ’s occupation was , to see Will Fern and Lilian eat and drink ; and so was Meg ’s . And never did spectators at a city dinner or court banquet find such high delight in seeing others feast : although it were a monarch or a pope : as those two did , in looking on that night . Meg smiled at Trotty , Trotty laughed at Meg . Meg shook her head , and made belief to clap her hands , applauding Trotty ; Trotty conveyed , in dumb - show , unintelligible narratives of how and when and where he had found their visitors , to Meg ; and they were happy . Very happy . ‘
18540	18553	18283	18283	Trotty	20	’ thought Trotty , sorrowfully , as he watched Meg ’s face ; ‘
18563	18564	18560	18560	I	0	’ ‘
18573	18579	18580	18582	The little one	400	’ said Trotty after tea . ‘
18592	18593	18584	18584	she	400	’ ‘
18598	18606	18596	18596	Meg	25	’ cried the child , caressing her . ‘
18610	18611	18608	18608	Meg	25	’ ‘
18616	18620	18608	18608	Meg	25	’ said Trotty . ‘
18639	18645	18648	18648	Trotty	20	’m _ Meg ’s father . ’
18670	18678	18680	18680	Trotty	20	‘ She ’s as sensible as Solomon , ’
18682	18713	18714	18714	Meg	25	‘ Here we come and here we — no , we don’t — I do n’t mean that — I — what was I saying , Meg , my precious ? ’
18746	18751	18753	18753	Toby	19	‘ To be sure , ’
18755	18766	18753	18753	Toby	19	‘ To be sure ! I do n’t know what I ’m
18795	18814	18815	18816	The man	1117	’re tired to death , and broken down for want of rest . You come along with me . ’
18869	18874	18876	18876	Trotty	20	‘ Yes , yes , ’
18890	19016	18876	18876	Trotty	20	‘ Take her with you , Meg . Get her to bed . There ! Now , Will , I ’ll show you where you lie . It ’s not much of a place : only a loft ; but , having a loft , I always say , is one of the great conveniences of living in a mews ; and till this coach - house and stable gets a better let , we live here cheap . There ’s plenty of sweet hay up there , belonging to a neighbour ; and it ’s as clean as hands , and Meg , can make it . Cheer up ! Do n’t give way . A new heart for a New Year , always ! ’
19102	19358	19095	19095	she	345	‘ Dearly , Dearly’—so her words ran — Trotty heard her stop and ask for his . It was some short time before the foolish little old fellow could compose himself to mend the fire , and draw his chair to the warm hearth . But , when he had done so , and had trimmed the light , he took his newspaper from his pocket , and began to read . Carelessly at first , and skimming up and down the columns ; but with an earnest and a sad attention , very soon . For this same dreaded paper re - directed Trotty ’s thoughts into the channel they had taken all that day , and which the day ’s events had so marked out and shaped . His interest in the two wanderers had set him on another course of thinking , and a happier one , for the time ; but being alone again , and reading of the crimes and violences of the people , he relapsed into his former train . In this mood , he came to an account ( and it was not the first he had ever read ) of a woman who had laid her desperate hands not only on her own life but on that of her young child . A crime so terrible , and so revolting to his soul , dilated with the love of Meg , that he let the journal drop , and fell back in his chair , appalled ! ‘

19630	19633	19635	19635	Trotty	20	‘ Meg , ’
19643	19649	19635	19635	Trotty	20	‘ Do you hear anything ? ’
19650	19660	19635	19635	Trotty	20	‘ I hear the Bells , father . Surely they ’re
19667	19668	19635	19635	Trotty	20	’ ‘
19673	19684	19670	19670	she	421	’ said Toby , making an excuse for peeping in . ‘
19707	19708	19709	19709	Meg	25	’ ‘
19711	19715	19709	19709	Meg	25	’ whispered Trotty . ‘
19721	19782	19709	19709	Meg	25	’ She listened , with her face towards him all the time . But it underwent no change . She did n’t understand them . Trotty withdrew , resumed his seat by the fire , and once more listened by himself . He remained here a little time . It was impossible to bear it ; their energy was dreadful . ‘
19792	19809	19709	19709	Meg	25	’ said Toby , hastily laying aside his apron , but never thinking of his hat , ‘
19842	20027	19709	19709	Meg	25	’ He was pretty certain as he slipped out quietly into the street that he should find it shut and locked , for he knew the door well , and had so rarely seen it open , that he could n’t reckon above three times in all . It was a low arched portal , outside the church , in a dark nook behind a column ; and had such great iron hinges , and such a monstrous lock , that there was more hinge and lock than door . But what was his astonishment when , coming bare - headed to the church ; and putting his hand into this dark nook , with a certain misgiving that it might be unexpectedly seized , and a shivering propensity to draw it back again ; he found that the door , which opened outwards , actually stood ajar ! He thought , on the first surprise , of going back ; or of getting a light , or a companion , but his courage aided him immediately , and he determined to ascend alone . ‘
20034	20038	20030	20030	I	0	’ said Trotty . ‘
20060	20697	20046	20047	the ringers	424	’ So he went in , feeling his way as he went , like a blind man ; for it was very dark . And very quiet , for the Chimes were silent . The dust from the street had blown into the recess ; and lying there , heaped up , made it so soft and velvet - like to the foot , that there was something startling , even in that . The narrow stair was so close to the door , too , that he stumbled at the very first ; and shutting the door upon himself , by striking it with his foot , and causing it to rebound back heavily , he could n’t open it again . This was another reason , however , for going on . Trotty groped his way , and went on . Up , up , up , and round , and round ; and up , up , up ; higher , higher , higher up ! It was a disagreeable staircase for that groping work ; so low and narrow , that his groping hand was always touching something ; and it often felt so like a man or ghostly figure standing up erect and making room for him to pass without discovery , that he would rub the smooth wall upward searching for its face , and downward searching for its feet , while a chill tingling crept all over him . Twice or thrice , a door or niche broke the monotonous surface ; and then it seemed a gap as wide as the whole church ; and he felt on the brink of an abyss , and going to tumble headlong down , until he found the wall again . Still up , up , up ; and round and round ; and up , up , up ; higher , higher , higher up ! At length , the dull and stifling atmosphere began to freshen : presently to feel quite windy : presently it blew so strong , that he could hardly keep his legs . But , he got to an arched window in the tower , breast high , and holding tight , looked down upon the house - tops , on the smoking chimneys , on the blur and blotch of lights ( towards the place where Meg was wondering where he was and calling to him perhaps ) , all kneaded up together in a leaven of mist and darkness . This was the belfry , where the ringers came . He had caught hold of one of the frayed ropes which hung down through apertures in the oaken roof . At first he started , thinking it was hair ; then trembled at the very thought of waking the deep Bell . The Bells themselves were higher . Higher , Trotty , in his fascination , or in working out the spell upon him , groped his way . By ladders now , and toilsomely , for it was steep , and not too certain holding for the feet . Up , up , up ; and climb and clamber ; up , up , up ; higher , higher , higher up ! Until , ascending through the floor , and pausing with his head just raised above its beams , he came among the Bells . It was barely possible to make out their great shapes in the gloom ; but there they were . Shadowy , and dark , and dumb . A heavy sense of dread and loneliness fell instantly upon him , as he climbed into this airy nest of stone and metal . His head went round and round . He listened , and then raised a wild ‘
20700	20887	20046	20047	the ringers	424	’ Holloa ! was mournfully protracted by the echoes . Giddy , confused , and out of breath , and frightened , Toby looked about him vacantly , and sunk down in a swoon . CHAPTER III — Third Quarter . Black are the brooding clouds and troubled the deep waters , when the Sea of Thought , first heaving from a calm , gives up its Dead . Monsters uncouth and wild , arise in premature , imperfect resurrection ; the several parts and shapes of different things are joined and mixed by chance ; and when , and how , and by what wonderful degrees , each separates from each , and every sense and object of the mind resumes its usual form and lives again , no man — though every man is every day the casket of this type of the Great Mystery — can tell . So , when and how the darkness of the night - black steeple changed to shining light ; when and how the solitary tower was peopled with a myriad figures ; when and how the whispered ‘
20893	20913	20046	20047	the ringers	424	’ breathing monotonously through his sleep or swoon , became a voice exclaiming in the waking ears of Trotty , ‘
20918	21250	20046	20047	the ringers	424	’ when and how he ceased to have a sluggish and confused idea that such things were , companioning a host of others that were not ; there are no dates or means to tell . But , awake and standing on his feet upon the boards where he had lately lain , he saw this Goblin Sight . He saw the tower , whither his charmed footsteps had brought him , swarming with dwarf phantoms , spirits , elfin creatures of the Bells . He saw them leaping , flying , dropping , pouring from the Bells without a pause . He saw them , round him on the ground ; above him , in the air ; clambering from him , by the ropes below ; looking down upon him , from the massive iron - girded beams ; peeping in upon him , through the chinks and loopholes in the walls ; spreading away and away from him in enlarging circles , as the water ripples give way to a huge stone that suddenly comes plashing in among them . He saw them , of all aspects and all shapes . He saw them ugly , handsome , crippled , exquisitely formed . He saw them young , he saw them old , he saw them kind , he saw them cruel , he saw them merry , he saw them grim ; he saw them dance , and heard them sing ; he saw them tear their hair , and heard them howl . He saw the air thick with them . He saw them come and go , incessantly . He saw them riding downward , soaring upward , sailing off afar , perching near at hand , all restless and all violently active . Stone , and brick , and slate , and tile , became transparent to him as to them . He saw them _ in _ the houses , busy at the sleepers ’

22184	22195	22197	22197	Trotty	20	‘ I thought my name was called by the Chimes ! ’
22208	22238	22197	22197	Trotty	20	‘ I hardly know why I am here , or how I came . I have listened to the Chimes these many years . They have cheered me often . ’
22239	22246	22248	22249	the Bell	58	‘ And you have thanked them ? ’

22260	22263	22258	22258	Trotty	20	‘ How ? ’
22264	22271	22273	22273	Trotty	20	‘ I am a poor man , ’
22275	22284	22273	22273	Trotty	20	‘ and could only thank them in words . ’
22285	22290	22292	22296	the Goblin of the Bell	457	‘ And always so ? ’
22298	22308	22292	22296	the Goblin of the Bell	457	‘ Have you never done us wrong in words ? ’
22309	22312	22314	22314	Trotty	20	‘ No ! ’
22317	22333	22314	22314	Trotty	20	‘ Never done us foul , and false , and wicked wrong , in words ? ’
22347	22350	22341	22341	Trotty	20	‘ Never ! ’

22370	22496	22367	22368	the Phantom	459	‘ cries to man , Advance ! Time is for his advancement and improvement ; for his greater worth , his greater happiness , his better life ; his progress onward to that goal within its knowledge and its view , and set there , in the period when Time and He began . Ages of darkness , wickedness , and violence , have come and gone — millions uncountable , have suffered , lived , and died — to point the way before him . Who seeks to turn him back , or stay him on his course , arrests a mighty engine which will strike the meddler dead ; and be the fiercer and the wilder , ever , for its momentary check ! ’
22497	22508	22510	22510	Trotty	20	‘ I never did so to my knowledge , sir , ’
22512	22531	22510	22510	Trotty	20	‘ It was quite by accident if I did . I would n’t go to do it , I ’m

22549	22557	22510	22510	Trotty	20	’ said the Goblin of the Bell , ‘
22637	22687	22625	22625	you	464	’ Trotty ’s first excess of fear was gone . But he had felt tenderly and gratefully towards the Bells , as you have seen ; and when he heard himself arraigned as one who had offended them so weightily , his heart was touched with penitence and grief . ‘
22692	22773	22625	22625	you	464	’ said Trotty , clasping his hands earnestly—‘or perhaps you do know — if you know how often you have kept me company ; how often you have cheered me up when I ’ve been low ; how you were quite the plaything of my little daughter Meg ( almost the only one she ever had ) when first her mother died , and she and me were left alone ; you wo n’t bear malice for a hasty word ! ’
22774	22854	22856	22857	the Bell	58	‘ Who hears in us , the Chimes , one note bespeaking disregard , or stern regard , of any hope , or joy , or pain , or sorrow , of the many - sorrowed throng ; who hears us make response to any creed that gauges human passions and affections , as it gauges the amount of miserable food on which humanity may pine and wither ; does us wrong . That wrong you have done us ! ’
22859	22863	22865	22865	Trotty	20	‘ I have ! ’
22867	22872	22865	22865	Trotty	20	‘ Oh forgive me ! ’
22873	22912	22625	22625	you	464	‘ Who hears us echo the dull vermin of the earth : the Putters Down of crushed and broken natures , formed to be raised up higher than such maggots of the time can crawl or can conceive , ’
22920	22936	22914	22918	the Goblin of the Bell	457	‘ who does so , does us wrong . And you have done us wrong ! ’
22937	22942	22944	22944	Trotty	20	‘ Not meaning it , ’
22946	22955	22944	22944	Trotty	20	‘ In my ignorance . Not meaning it ! ’
22956	22964	22966	22967	the Bell	467	‘ Lastly , and most of all , ’
22969	23054	22966	22967	the Bell	467	‘ Who turns his back upon the fallen and disfigured of his kind ; abandons them as vile ; and does not trace and track with pitying eyes the unfenced precipice by which they fell from good — grasping in their fall some tufts and shreds of that lost soil , and clinging to them still when bruised and dying in the gulf below ; does wrong to Heaven and man , to time and to eternity . And you have done that wrong ! ’

24493	24510	24491	24491	Lilly	51	’ said Meg , soothing her , and putting back her hair from her wet face . ‘

24584	24924	24945	24946	King Hal	65	’ Trotty turned to look upon his guide . But the Spirit of the child had taken flight . Was gone . Neither did he himself remain in the same place ; for , Sir Joseph Bowley , Friend and Father of the Poor , held a great festivity at Bowley Hall , in honour of the natal day of Lady Bowley . And as Lady Bowley had been born on New Year ’s Day ( which the local newspapers considered an especial pointing of the finger of Providence to number One , as Lady Bowley ’s destined figure in Creation ) , it was on a New Year ’s Day that this festivity took place . Bowley Hall was full of visitors . The red - faced gentleman was there , Mr. Filer was there , the great Alderman Cute was there — Alderman Cute had a sympathetic feeling with great people , and had considerably improved his acquaintance with Sir Joseph Bowley on the strength of his attentive letter : indeed had become quite a friend of the family since then — and many guests were there . Trotty ’s ghost was there , wandering about , poor phantom , drearily ; and looking for its guide . There was to be a great dinner in the Great Hall . At which Sir Joseph Bowley , in his celebrated character of Friend and Father of the Poor , was to make his great speech . Certain plum - puddings were to be eaten by his Friends and Children in another Hall first ; and , at a given signal , Friends and Children flocking in among their Friends and Fathers , were to form a family assemblage , with not one manly eye therein unmoistened by emotion . But , there was more than this to happen . Even more than this . Sir Joseph Bowley , Baronet and Member of Parliament , was to play a match at skittles — real skittles — with his tenants ! ‘
24930	24935	24945	24946	King Hal	65	’ said Alderman Cute , ‘
24957	24958	24945	24946	King Hal	65	’ ‘
24961	24968	24945	24946	King Hal	65	’ said Mr. Filer , dryly . ‘
24974	24988	24945	24946	King Hal	65	’em . Considerably more than the average number of wives by the bye . ’
24989	25000	24945	24946	King Hal	65	‘ You ’ll marry the beautiful ladies , and not murder ’em
25004	25017	24945	24946	King Hal	65	’ said Alderman Cute to the heir of Bowley , aged twelve . ‘
25031	25050	25021	25021	We	507	’ said the Alderman , holding him by the shoulders , and looking as reflective as he could , ‘

25126	25170	25171	25171	Richard	32	’ Trotty thought . But his heart yearned towards the child , for the love of those same shoeless and stockingless boys , predestined ( by the Alderman ) to turn out bad , who might have been the children of poor Meg . ‘
25173	25186	25171	25171	Richard	32	’ moaned Trotty , roaming among the company , to and fro ; ‘
25201	25239	25199	25199	Richard	32	’ Not likely to be there , if still alive ! But Trotty ’s grief and solitude confused him ; and he still went wandering among the gallant company , looking for his guide , and saying , ‘
25248	25268	25199	25199	Richard	32	’ He was wandering thus , when he encountered Mr. Fish , the confidential Secretary : in great agitation . ‘
25275	25280	25199	25199	Richard	32	’ cried Mr. Fish . ‘
25292	25425	25287	25287	anybody	884	’ Seen the Alderman ? Oh dear ! Who could ever help seeing the Alderman ? He was so considerate , so affable , he bore so much in mind the natural desires of folks to see him , that if he had a fault , it was the being constantly On View . And wherever the great people were , there , to be sure , attracted by the kindred sympathy between great souls , was Cute . Several voices cried that he was in the circle round Sir Joseph . Mr. Fish made way there ; found him ; and took him secretly into a window near at hand . Trotty joined them . Not of his own accord . He felt that his steps were led in that direction . ‘
25431	25436	25428	25429	Alderman Cute	40	’ said Mr. Fish . ‘

25539	25544	25536	25537	the banker	329	’ gasped the Secretary . ‘

27944	28292	28294	28294	I	0	’ A sudden stir and agitation took place in Hall . Trotty thought at first , that several had risen to eject the man ; and hence this change in its appearance . But , another moment showed him that the room and all the company had vanished from his sight , and that his daughter was again before him , seated at her work . But in a poorer , meaner garret than before ; and with no Lilian by her side . The frame at which she had worked , was put away upon a shelf and covered up . The chair in which she had sat , was turned against the wall . A history was written in these little things , and in Meg ’s grief - worn face . Oh ! who could fail to read it ! Meg strained her eyes upon her work until it was too dark to see the threads ; and when the night closed in , she lighted her feeble candle and worked on . Still her old father was invisible about her ; looking down upon her ; loving her — how dearly loving her!—and talking to her in a tender voice about the old times , and the Bells . Though he knew , poor Trotty , though he knew she could not hear him . A great part of the evening had worn away , when a knock came at her door . She opened it . A man was on the threshold . A slouching , moody , drunken sloven , wasted by intemperance and vice , and with his matted hair and unshorn beard in wild disorder ; but , with some traces on him , too , of having been a man of good proportion and good features in his youth . He stopped until he had her leave to enter ; and she , retiring a pace or two from the open door , silently and sorrowfully looked upon him . Trotty had his wish . He saw Richard . ‘

28310	28473	28294	28294	I	0	’ It was well that Trotty knew him before he spoke ; for with any doubt remaining on his mind , the harsh discordant voice would have persuaded him that it was not Richard but some other man . There were but two chairs in the room . She gave him hers , and stood at some short distance from him , waiting to hear what he had to say . He sat , however , staring vacantly at the floor ; with a lustreless and stupid smile . A spectacle of such deep degradation , of such abject hopelessness , of such a miserable downfall , that she put her hands before her face and turned away , lest he should see how much it moved her . Roused by the rustling of her dress , or some such trifling sound , he lifted his head , and began to speak as if there had been no pause since he entered . ‘

28666	28674	28655	28655	She	595	’ cried Meg , clasping her hands . ‘

28731	28816	28817	28817	He	0	’m at my work ( ha , ha ! that an’t often ) , and before I can turn my head , her voice is in my ear , saying , “ Richard , do n’t look round . For Heaven ’s love , give her this ! ” She brings it where I live : she sends it in letters ; she taps at the window and lays it on the sill . What _ can _ I do ? Look at it ! ’
28834	28838	28840	28840	Meg	25	‘ Hide it , ’

That , in my solitary work , I never cease to have her in my thoughts . That she is with me , night and day . That if I died to - morrow , I would remember her with my last breath . But , that I can not look upon it ! ’
28957	29015	28937	28937	He	597	‘ I told her so . I told her so , as plain as words could speak . I ’ve taken this gift back and left it at her door , a dozen times since then . But when she came at last , and stood before me , face to face , what could I do ? ’
29016	29021	29023	29023	Meg	25	‘ You saw her ! ’
29025	29044	29023	29023	Meg	25	‘ You saw her ! O , Lilian , my sweet girl ! O , Lilian , Lilian ! ’

29313	29449	29304	29304	he	599	‘ I did ! That ’s neither here nor there—“O Richard , if you ever did ; if you have any memory for what is gone and lost , take it to her once more . Once more ! Tell her how I laid my head upon your shoulder , where her own head might have lain , and was so humble to you , Richard . Tell her that you looked into my face , and saw the beauty which she used to praise , all gone : all gone : and in its place , a poor , wan , hollow cheek , that she would weep to see . Tell her everything , and take it back , and she will not refuse again . She will not have the heart ! ” ’

How many other kinds of petty merchandise were there , it would be difficult to say ; but balls of packthread , ropes of onions , pounds of candles , cabbage - nets , and brushes , hung in bunches from the ceiling , like extraordinary fruit ; while various odd canisters emitting aromatic smells , established the veracity of the inscription over the outer door , which informed the public that the keeper of this little shop was a licensed dealer in tea , coffee , tobacco , pepper , and snuff . Glancing at such of these articles as were visible in the shining of the blaze , and the less cheerful radiance of two smoky lamps which burnt but dimly in the shop itself , as though its plethora sat heavy on their lungs ; and glancing , then , at one of the two faces by the parlour - fire ; Trotty had small difficulty in recognising in the stout old lady , Mrs. Chickenstalker : always inclined to corpulency , even in the days when he had known her as established in the general line , and having a small balance against him in her books . The features of her companion were less easy to him . The great broad chin , with creases in it large enough to hide a finger in ; the astonished eyes , that seemed to expostulate with themselves for sinking deeper and deeper into the yielding fat of the soft face ; the nose afflicted with that disordered action of its functions which is generally termed The Snuffles ; the short thick throat and labouring chest , with other beauties of the like description ; though calculated to impress the memory , Trotty could at first allot to nobody he had ever known : and yet he had some recollection of them too . At length , in Mrs. Chickenstalker ’s partner in the general line , and in the crooked and eccentric line of life , he recognised the former porter of Sir Joseph Bowley ; an apoplectic innocent , who had connected himself in Trotty ’s mind with Mrs. Chickenstalker years ago , by giving him admission to the mansion where he had confessed his obligations to that lady , and drawn on his unlucky head such grave reproach . Trotty had little interest in a change like this , after the changes he had seen ; but association is very strong sometimes ; and he looked involuntarily behind the parlour - door , where the accounts of credit customers were usually kept in chalk . There was no record of his name . Some names were there , but they were strange to him , and infinitely fewer than of old ; from which he argued that the porter was an advocate of ready - money transactions , and on coming into the business had looked pretty sharp after the Chickenstalker defaulters . So desolate was Trotty , and so mournful for the youth and promise of his blighted child , that it was a sorrow to him , even to have no place in Mrs. Chickenstalker ’s ledger . ‘
31153	31190	31151	31151	Anne	71	’ inquired the former porter of Sir Joseph Bowley , stretching out his legs before the fire , and rubbing as much of them as his short arms could reach ; with an air that added , ‘

31843	31848	31840	31841	Mrs. Tugby	73	’ said the gentleman . ‘

31910	31946	31952	31953	Mr. Tugby	74	’ Looking by turns at Tugby and his wife , he sounded the barrel with his knuckles for the depth of beer , and having found it , played a tune upon the empty part . ‘
31955	31970	31952	31953	Mr. Tugby	74	’ said the gentleman : Tugby having stood in silent consternation for some time : ‘

31978	31987	31952	31953	Mr. Tugby	74	’ said Tugby , turning to his wife , ‘

32458	32647	32453	32453	her	662	’ Then he listened , with a panting heart , for what should follow . Knowing nothing yet , but that they spoke of Meg . If Tugby had been a little elevated in the parlour , he more than balanced that account by being not a little depressed in the shop , where he now stood staring at his wife , without attempting a reply ; secretly conveying , however — either in a fit of abstraction or as a precautionary measure — all the money from the till into his own pockets , as he looked at her . The gentleman upon the table - beer cask , who appeared to be some authorised medical attendant upon the poor , was far too well accustomed , evidently , to little differences of opinion between man and wife , to interpose any remark in this instance . He sat softly whistling , and turning little drops of beer out of the tap upon the ground , until there was a perfect calm : when he raised his head , and said to Mrs. Tugby , late Chickenstalker : ‘
32667	32668	32661	32661	she	663	’ ‘
32672	32683	32691	32691	her	663	’ said Mrs. Tugby , taking a seat near him , ‘
32924	32925	32915	32915	she	663	’ ‘
32935	32964	32933	32933	he	32	’ said the gentleman , pulling out the vent - peg of the table - beer , and trying to peep down into the barrel through the hole . ‘
33108	33109	33110	33110	He	32	’ ‘
33119	33124	33116	33117	Mrs. Tugby	73	’ returned the gentleman , ‘
33141	33142	33143	33143	I	0	’ ‘
33144	33315	33116	33117	Mrs. Tugby	73	’m coming to it , sir , in a moment . This went on for years and years ; he sinking lower and lower ; she enduring , poor thing , miseries enough to wear her life away . At last , he was so cast down , and cast out , that no one would employ or notice him ; and doors were shut upon him , go where he would . Applying from place to place , and door to door ; and coming for the hundredth time to one gentleman who had often and often tried him ( he was a good workman to the very end ) ; that gentleman , who knew his history , said , “ I believe you are incorrigible ; there is only one person in the world who has a chance of reclaiming you ; ask me to trust you no more , until she tries to do it . ” Something like that , in his anger and vexation . ’
33316	33319	33321	33322	the gentleman	912	‘ Ah ! ’
33324	33327	33321	33322	the gentleman	912	‘ Well ? ’
33328	33365	33116	33117	Mrs. Tugby	73	‘ Well , sir , he went to her , and kneeled to her ; said it was so ; said it ever had been so ; and made a prayer to her to save him . ’
33366	33375	33116	33117	Mrs. Tugby	73	‘ And she?—Don’t distress yourself , Mrs. Tugby . ’
33376	33558	33321	33322	the gentleman	912	‘ She came to me that night to ask me about living here . “ What he was once to me , ” she said , “ is buried in a grave , side by side with what I was to him . But I have thought of this ; and I will make the trial . In the hope of saving him ; for the love of the light - hearted girl ( you remember her ) who was to have been married on a New Year ’s Day ; and for the love of her Richard . ” And she said he had come to her from Lilian , and Lilian had trusted to him , and she never could forget that . So they were married ; and when they came home here , and I saw them , I hoped that such prophecies as parted them when they were young , may not often fulfil themselves as they did in this case , or I would n’t be the makers of them for a Mine of Gold . ’
33572	33587	33568	33568	himself	912	‘ I suppose he used her ill , as soon as they were married ? ’
33588	33598	33600	33601	Mrs. Tugby	73	‘ I do n’t think he ever did that , ’
33612	33772	33604	33604	her	73	‘ He went on better for a short time ; but , his habits were too old and strong to be got rid of ; he soon fell back a little ; and was falling fast back , when his illness came so strong upon him . I think he has always felt for her . I am sure he has . I have seen him , in his crying fits and tremblings , try to kiss her hand ; and I have heard him call her “ Meg , ” and say it was her nineteenth birthday . There he has been lying , now , these weeks and months . Between him and her baby , she has not been able to do her old work ; and by not being able to be regular , she has lost it , even if she could have done it . How they have lived , I hardly know ! ’
33773	33777	33779	33780	Mr. Tugby	74	‘ I know , ’
33805	33810	33811	33811	He	74	‘ Like Fighting Cocks ! ’
33839	33843	33844	33844	he	74	‘ My friend , ’
33850	33873	33844	33844	he	74	‘ you need n’t discuss whether he shall be removed or not . He has spared you that trouble , I believe . ’
33941	33951	33925	33925	Trotty	20	‘ Follow her ! Follow her ! Follow her ! ’
33967	33979	33961	33961	their	695	‘ Learn it , from the creature dearest to your heart ! ’
34054	34058	34060	34060	Trotty	20	‘ Thank God ! ’
34068	34080	34081	34082	The gentleman	912	‘ O , God be thanked ! She loves her child ! ’
34146	34159	34127	34127	his	912	‘ His pain is over . It ’s better as it is ! ’
34174	34179	34180	34180	he	74	‘ Come , come ! ’
34190	34263	34180	34180	he	74	‘ you must n’t give way , you know . That wo n’t do . You must fight up . What would have become of me if _ I _ had given way when I was porter , and we had as many as six runaway carriage - doubles at our door in one night ! But , I fell back upon my strength of mind , and did n’t open it ! ’
34271	34275	34276	34276	He	20	‘ Follow her ! ’
34294	34298	34276	34276	He	20	‘ Follow her ! ’
34427	34440	34441	34441	He	20	‘ She loves it ! God be thanked , she loves it ! ’

34865	34869	34862	34862	he	219	‘ William Fern ! ’
34870	34876	34877	34877	He	219	‘ For the last time . ’
34889	34916	34880	34881	a man	219	‘ Margaret , my race is nearly run . I could n’t finish it , without a parting word with you . Without one grateful word . ’

34973	34994	34947	34947	he	219	‘ It ’s long ago , Margaret , now : but that night is as fresh in my memory as ever ’

35447	35457	35458	35458	he	1374	‘ There ’ll be a Fire to - night , ’
35465	35551	35552	35552	She	491	‘ There ’ll be Fires this winter - time , to light the dark nights , East , West , North , and South . When you see the distant sky red , they ’ll be blazing . When you see the distant sky red , think of me no more ; or , if you do , remember what a Hell was lighted up inside of me , and think you see its flames reflected in the clouds . Good night . Good bye ! ’

36001	36040	36042	36043	Mr. Tugby	74	‘ Do n’t you think you have lived here long enough without paying any rent ? Do n’t you think that , without any money , you ’ve been a pretty constant customer at this shop , now ? ’
36052	36061	36062	36062	he	74	‘ Suppose you try and deal somewhere else , ’
36065	36086	36062	36062	he	74	‘ And suppose you provide yourself with another lodging . Come ! Do n’t you think you could manage it ? ’

36271	36328	36260	36260	Tugby	74	‘ I wonder you an’t ashamed of yourself , to carry such practices into a New Year . If you have n’t any business in the world , but to be always giving way , and always making disturbances between man and wife , you ’d be better out of it . Go along with you . ’

Think what her misery must have been , when such seed bears such fruit ! Heaven meant her to be good . There is no loving mother on the earth who might not come to this , if such a life had gone before . O , have mercy on my child , who , even at this pass , means mercy to her own , and dies herself , and perils her immortal soul , to save it ! ’

I know there is a sea of Time to rise one day , before which all who wrong us or oppress us will be swept away like leaves . I see it , on the flow ! I know that we must trust and hope , and neither doubt ourselves , nor doubt the good in one another . I have learnt it from the creature dearest to my heart . I clasp her in my arms again . O Spirits , merciful and good , I take your lesson to my breast along with her ! O Spirits , merciful and good , I am grateful ! ’

38570	38596	38603	38603	I	0	’ Which was received with a general shout . The Drum was rather drunk , by - the - bye ; but , never mind . ‘

38999	39047	38982	38982	Fern	45	’ and meeting hastily , they exchanged some hurried words together ; of which the upshot was , that Mrs. Chickenstalker shook him by both hands ; saluted Trotty on his cheek again of her own free will ; and took the child to her capacious breast . ‘
39051	39063	39049	39049	Fern	45	’ said Trotty , pulling on his right - hand muffler . ‘
