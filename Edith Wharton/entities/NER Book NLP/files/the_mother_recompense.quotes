And Anne is not the kind to dig and brood : thank goodness , she ’s health itself , body and soul . She asks no questions ; never has . Why should I have put it into her head that there were any to ask ? Her grandmother did n’t . It was her policy ... as it ’s been mine . If we did n’t always agree , the old lady and I , we did on _ that _ . ”
13575	13598	13599	13599	he	94	“ Anne was simply given to understand that you and her father did n’t agree ; that ’s all . A girl , ”
13607	13675	13599	13599	he	94	“ ca n’t grow up nowadays without seeing a good many cases of the kind about her ; Lord forgive me , they ’re getting to be the rule rather than the exception . Lots of things that you , at her age , might have puzzled over and thought mysterious , she probably takes for granted . At any rate she behaves as if she did . “
13867	13902	13914	13914	she	95	” He had recovered his ease , and sat down again , his hands on his knees , his trouser - hem rather too high above wrinkled socks and solemn square - toed boots . “
13907	13912	13914	13914	she	95	” he added smiling , “
13944	13949	13932	13932	she	95	” he concluded gaily , “
13987	14055	14058	14058	you	0	” As he blinked at her with kindly brotherly eyes she saw in their ingenuous depths the terror of the man who has tried to buy off fate by one optimistic evasion after another , till it has become second nature to hand out his watch and pocket - book whenever reality waylays him . She exchanged one glance with that lurking fear ; then she said : “
14084	14126	14128	14128	they	691	” His face clouded again , though not with irritation . He seemed to understand that the appeal was reasonable , and to want to help her , yet to feel that with every word she was making it more difficult . “
14145	14147	14149	14149	you	0	” ( “
14155	14163	14149	14149	you	0	” his tone seemed to imply . ) “
14169	14173	14175	14176	another man	692	” He nodded . “
14178	14188	14190	14191	another man	692	” Reluctantly he brought the words out after her : “
14193	14194	14190	14191	another man	692	” “
14199	14200	14201	14202	Hylton Davies	105	” “
14204	14205	14201	14202	Hylton Davies	105	” “
14216	14228	14201	14202	Hylton Davies	105	” He frowned , but immediately fetched a sigh of relief . “
14240	14251	14252	14252	He	105	” He glanced at her cautiously , and then added : “
14262	14267	14252	14252	He	105	” But she insisted : “
14272	14292	14252	14252	He	105	” Mr. Landers lifted his hand in a gesture of reassurance ; the cloud was lifted from his brow . “
14400	14413	14398	14399	Enid Drover--	144	” Her blood rushed up and the pulses drummed in her temples . “
14418	14422	14415	14415	I	0	” she thought , “
14427	14440	14441	14442	Enid Drover	145	” but the tears rose in a warm gush about her heart . “
14447	14448	14441	14442	Enid Drover	145	” “
14466	14547	14441	14442	Enid Drover	145	” She began to tremble . Even her husband ’s sister Enid Drover ! She had remembered the Hendrik Drovers , both husband and wife , as among the narrowest , the most inexorable of the Clephane tribe . But then , it suddenly flashed across her , if it had n’t been for the episode with Chris perhaps she might have come back years before . What mocking twists fate gave to one ’s poor little life - pattern ! “
14550	14567	14441	14442	Enid Drover	145	” she questioned , breathless . He met her gaze now without a shadow of constraint . “
14619	14620	14651	14651	he	96	” “
14623	14624	14651	14651	he	96	” “
14704	14709	14702	14702	her	707	” He reddened again . “
14724	14836	14702	14702	her	707	” Kate Clephane lay silent , staring at the fire . Tentatively , fearfully , she was building up out of her visitor ’s tones , his words , his reticences , the incredible fact that , for him and all her husband ’s family -- that huge imperious clan -- her life , after she had left them , had been divided into two sharply differentiated parts : the brief lapse with Hylton Davies , the long expiation alone . Of that third episode , which for her was the central fact of her experience , apparently not a hint had reached them . She was the woman who had once “
14840	15225	15246	15256	artists ” or “ thinkers ” to ignore the barbarian commotion	1571	” , and then , regaining her natural uprightness , had retained it inflexibly through all the succeeding years . As the truth penetrated her mind she was more frightened than relieved . Was she not returning on false pretences to these kindly forgiving relations ? Was it not possible , indeed almost certain , that a man like Frederick Landers , had he known about Chris , would have used all his influence to dissuade Anne from sending for her , instead of exerting it in the opposite sense , as he avowedly had ? And , that being so , was she not taking them all unawares , actually abusing their good faith , in passing herself off as the penitential figure whom the passage of blameless years had gradually changed from the offending into the offended ? Yet was it , after all , possible that the affair with Chris , and the life she had led with him , could so completely have escaped their notice ? Rumour has a million eyes , and though she had preserved appearances in certain , almost superstitious , ways , she had braved them recklessly in others , especially toward the end , when the fear of losing Chris had swept away all her precautions . Then suddenly the explanation dawned on her . She had met Chris for the first time less than a year before the outbreak of the war , and the last of their months together , the most reckless and fervid , had been overshadowed , blotted out of everybody ’s sight , in that universal eclipse . She had never before thought of it in that way : for her the war had begun only when Chris left her . During its first months she and he had been in Spain and Italy , shut off by the safe Alps or the neutral indifference ; and the devouring need to keep Chris amused , and herself amusing , had made her fall into the easy life of the Italian watering - places , and the careless animation of Rome , without any real sense of being in an altered world . Around them they found only the like - minded ; the cheerful , who refused to be “
15227	15245	15246	15256	artists ” or “ thinkers ” to ignore the barbarian commotion	1571	” , or the argumentative and paradoxical , like Chris himself , who thought it their duty as “
15247	15249	15246	15256	artists ” or “ thinkers ” to ignore the barbarian commotion	1571	” or “
15251	15742	15743	15743	He	710	” to ignore the barbarian commotion . It was only in 1915 , when Chris ’s own attitude was mysteriously altered , and she found him muttering that after all a fellow could n’t stand aside when all his friends and the chaps of his own age were getting killed -- only then did the artificial defences fall , and the reality stream in on her . Was his change of mind genuine ? He often said that his opinions had n’t altered , but that there were times when opinions did n’t count ... when a fellow just had to _ act _ . It was her own secret thought ( had been , perhaps , for longer than she knew ) ; but with Chris -- could one ever tell ? Whatever he was doing , he was sure , after a given time , to want to be doing something else , and to find plausible reasons for it : even the war might be serving merely as a pretext for his unrest . Unless ... unless he used it as an excuse for leaving her ? Unless being with _ her _ was what it offered an escape from ? If only she could have judged him more clearly , known him better ! But between herself and any clear understanding of him there had hung , from the first , the obscuring mist of her passion , muffling his face , touch , speech ( so that now , at times , she could not even rebuild his features or recall his voice ) , obscuring every fold and cranny of his character , every trick of phrase , every doubling and dodging of his restless mind and capricious fancy . Sometimes , in looking back , she thought there was only one sign she had ever read clearly in him , and that was the first sign of his growing tired of her . Disguise that as she would , avert her eyes from it , argue it away , there the menace always was again , faint but persistent , like the tiny intermittent pang which first announces a mortal malady . And of all this none of the people watching her from across the sea had had a suspicion . The war had swallowed her up , her and all her little concerns , as it had engulfed so many million others . It seemed written that , till the end , she should have to be thankful for the war . Her eyes travelled back to Fred Landers , whose sturdy bulk , planted opposite her , seemed to have grown so far off and immaterial . Did he really guess nothing of that rainbow world she had sent her memory back to ? And what would he think or say if she lifted the veil and let him into it ? “
15754	15765	15751	15751	I	0	” she murmured . She raised herself on her elbow : “
15767	15800	15801	15802	Uncle Fred	94	” The door opened softly to admit Anne , with the Airedale at her heels . They brought in a glow of winter air and the strange cold perfume of the dusk . “
15823	15890	15815	15815	I	0	” the girl said , bending to her mother ’s cheek . At the caress the blood flowed back into Kate ’s heart . She looked up and her eyes drank in her daughter ’s image . Anne hung above her for a moment , tall , black - cloaked , remote in the faint light ; then she dropped on her knees beside the couch . “
15907	15931	15932	15932	You	94	” she exclaimed , slipping an arm protectingly behind her mother . There was a note of reproach and indignation in her voice . “
15976	15981	15973	15974	Uncle Fred	94	” she added gaily . “
15999	16018	15985	15985	I	0	” Mr. Landers corroborated , getting up from his chair and making for the door with muffled steps . “
16038	16079	16080	16080	I	0	” Kate Clephane let her hand droop against the strong young shoulder . She felt herself sinking down into a very Bethesda - pool of forgetfulness and peace . From its depths she raised herself just far enough to say : “
16083	16103	16080	16080	I	0	” IV . Anne , withdrawing from her mother ’s embrace , had decreed , in a decisive tone : “
16141	16142	16137	16137	you	1508	” “
16158	16174	16196	16196	I	0	” But the girl had been firm , in a sweet yet almost obstinate way . “
16222	16254	16255	16255	We	717	” Where did her fresh flexible voice get its note of finality ? It was -- yes , without doubt -- an echo of old Mrs. Clephane ’s way of saying : “
16266	16436	16255	16255	We	717	” Kate shivered a little ; but it was only a passing chill . The use the girl made of her authority was so different -- as if the old Mrs. Clephane in her spoke from a milder sphere -- and it was so sweet to be compelled , to have things decided for one , to be told what one wanted and what was best for one . For years Kate Clephane had had to order herself about : to tell herself to rest and not to worry , to eat when she was n’t hungry , to sleep when she felt staring wide - awake . She would have preferred , on the whole , that evening , to slip into a tea - gown and go down to a quiet dinner , alone with her daughter and perhaps Fred Landers ; she shrank from the hurricane that would start up in her head as soon as she was alone ; yet she liked better still to be “
16438	16635	16255	16255	We	717	” in that fond blundering way the young have of mothering their elders . And besides , Anne perhaps felt -- not unwisely -- that again , for the moment , she and her mother had nothing more to say to each other ; that to close on that soft note was better , just then , than farther effort . At any rate , Anne evidently did not expect to have her decision questioned . It was that hint of finality in her solicitude that made Kate , as she sank into the lavender - scented pillows , feel -- perhaps evoked by the familiar scent of cared - for linen -- the closing - in on her of all the old bounds . The next morning banished the sensation . She felt only , now , the novelty , the strangeness . Anne , entering in the wake of a perfect breakfast - tray , announced that Uncle Hendrik and Aunt Enid Drover were coming to dine , with their eldest son , Alan , with Lilla Gates ( Lilla Gates , Kate recalled , was their married daughter ) and Uncle Fred Landers . “
16646	16652	16653	16653	you	1521	” the girl touched her mourning dress--“but
16673	16697	16698	16700	No one else	718	” she added hastily , lest her words should seem to imply that her mother might have other reasons for shrinking from people . “
16702	16706	16698	16700	No one else	718	” she continued , “
16754	16768	16741	16741	She	156	” The words dropped from her as indifferently as if she had said : “
16787	16788	16778	16778	Joe	155	” “
16796	16803	16789	16790	Nollie Tresselton	154	” Anne began after a pause . “
16840	16841	16842	16842	Lilla	153	” “
16847	16848	16844	16845	Lilla Gates	153	” “
16903	16919	16893	16893	I	0	” The girl paused , suddenly embarrassed ; then , glancing out of the window : “
16974	17008	16933	16933	you	1521	” * * * * * The rush through the vivid air ; the spectacle of the new sumptuous city ; of the long reaches above the Hudson with their showy architecture and towering “
17010	17154	17155	17155	Nollie	154	” ; of the smooth Boulevards flowing out to cared - for prosperous suburbs ; the vista of Fifth Avenue , as they returned , stretching southward , interminably , between monumental façades and resplendent shop - fronts -- all this and the tone of Anne ’s talk , her unconscious allusions , revelations of herself and her surroundings , acted like champagne on Kate Clephane ’s brain , making the world reel about her in a headlong dance that challenged her to join it . The way they all took their mourning , for instance ! She , Anne , being her grandmother ’s heiress ( she explained ) would of course not wear colours till Easter , or go to the Opera ( except to matinées ) for at least another month . Did n’t her mother think she was right ? “
17212	17213	17204	17204	you	728	” “
17228	17940	17221	17221	I	0	” Inwardly , Kate was recalling the inexorable laws which had governed family affliction in the New York to which she had come as a bride : three crape - walled years for a parent , two for sister or brother , at least twelve solid months of black for grandparent or aunt , and half a year ( to the full ) for cousins , even if you counted them by dozens , as the Clephanes did . As for the weeds of widowhood , they were supposed to be measured only by the extent of the survivor ’s affliction , and _ that _ was expected to last as long , and proclaim itself as unmistakably in crape and seclusion , as the most intolerant censor in the family decreed -- unless you were prepared to flout the whole clan , and could bear to be severely reminded that your veil was a quarter of a yard shorter than cousin Julia ’s , though her bereavement antedated yours by six months . Much as Kate Clephane had suffered under the old dispensation , she felt a slight recoil from the indifference that had succeeded it . She herself , just before sailing , had replaced the coloured finery hastily bought on the Riviera by a few dresses of unnoticeable black , which , without suggesting the hypocrisy of her wearing mourning for old Mrs. Clephane , yet kept her appearance in harmony with her daughter ’s ; and Anne ’s question made her glad that she had done so . The new tolerance , she soon began to see , applied to everything ; or , if it did n’t , she had not yet discovered the new prohibitions , and during all that first glittering day seemed to move through a millennium where the lamb of pleasure lay down with the lion of propriety .... After all , this New York into which she was being reinducted had never , in any of its stages , been hers ; and the fact , which had facilitated her flight from it , leaving fewer broken ties and uprooted habits , would now , she saw , in an equal measure simplify her return . Her absence , during all those years , had counted , for the Clephanes , only in terms of her husband ’s humiliation ; there had been no family of her own to lament her fall , take up her defence , quarrel with the clan over the rights and wrongs of the case , force people to take sides , and leave a ramification of vague rancours to which her return would give new life . The old aunts and indifferent cousins at Meridia -- her remote inland town -- had bowed their heads before the scandal , thanking fortune that the people they visited would probably never hear of it . And now she came back free of everything and every one , and rather like a politician resuming office than a prodigal returning to his own . The sense of it was so rejuvenating that she was almost sure she was looking her best ( and with less help than usual from Aline ) when she went down to dinner to meet the clan . Enid Drover ’s appearance gave a momentary check to her illusion : Enid , after eighteen years , seemed alarmingly the same -- pursed - up lips , pure vocabulary and all . She had even kept , to an astonishing degree , the physical air of her always middle - aged youth , the smooth complexion , symmetrically - waved hair and empty eyes that made her plump small - nosed face like a statue ’s . Yet the mere fact of her daughter Lilla profoundly altered her -- the fact that she could sit beaming maternally across the table at that impudent stripped version of herself , with dyed hair , dyed lashes , drugged eyes and unintelligible dialect . And her husband , Hendrik Drover -- the typical old New Yorker -- that he too should accept this outlawed daughter , laugh at her slang , and greet her belated entrance with the remark : “
17951	17952	17949	17949	Lil	160	” “
17960	17983	17955	17955	Lilla	153	” laughed Mrs. Joe Tresselton , slipping her thin brown arm through her cousin ’s heavy white one . Lilla laughed indolently . “
17990	17991	17987	17987	you	731	” “
18013	18240	18008	18008	she	161	” _ Aunt Kate ! _ How sweet it sounded , in that endearing young voice ! No wonder Anne had spoken as she did of Nollie . Whatever Mrs. Joe Tresselton ’s past had been , it had left on her no traces like those which had smirched and deadened Lilla . Kate smiled back at Nollie and loved her . She was prepared to love Joe Tresselton too , if only for having brought this live thing into the family . Personally , Joe did n’t at first offer many points of contact : he was so hopelessly like his cousin Alan Drover , and like all the young American officers Kate had seen on leave on the Riviera , and all the young men who showed off collars or fountain - pens or golf - clubs in the backs of American magazines . But then Kate had been away so long that , as yet , the few people she had seen were always on the point of being merged into a collective American Face . She wondered if Anne would marry an American Face , and hoped , before that , to learn to differentiate them ; meanwhile , she would begin by practising on Joe , who , seating himself beside her with the collective smile , seemed about to remark : “
18245	18250	18251	18251	Anne	95	” Instead he said : “
18262	18487	18257	18257	she	95	” and thereby acquired an immediate individuality for Anne ’s mother . Dinner was announced , and at the dining - room door Kate wavered , startled by the discovery that it was still exactly the same room -- black and gold , with imitation tapestries and a staring white bust niched in a red marble over - mantel -- and feeling once more uncertain as to what was expected of her . But already Anne was guiding her to her old seat at the head of the table , and waiting for her to assign their places to the others . The girl did it without a word ; just a glance and the least touch . If this were indeed a mannerless age , how miraculously Anne ’s manners had been preserved ! And now the dinner was progressing , John Clephane ’s champagne bubbling in their glasses ( it seemed oddest of all to be drinking her husband ’s Veuve Clicquot ) , Lilla steadily smoking , both elbows on the table , and Nollie Tresselton leading an exchange of chaff between the younger cousins , with the object , as Kate Clephane guessed , of giving her , the newcomer , time to take breath and get her bearings . It was wonderful , sitting there , to recall the old “
18490	18607	18257	18257	she	95	” , when Enid ’s small censorious smile ( Enid , then in her twenties ! ) seemed as inaccessible to pity as the forbidding line of old Mrs. Clephane ’s lips ; when even Joe Tresselton ’s mother ( that lazy fat Alethea Tresselton ) had taken her cue from the others , and echoed their severities with a mouth made for kissing and forgiving ; and John Clephane , at the foot of the table , proud of his house , proud of his wine , proud of his cook , still half - proud of his wife , was visibly saying to himself , as he looked about on his healthy handsome relatives : “
18617	18691	18257	18257	she	95	” The contrast was the more curious because nothing , after all , could really alter people like the Drovers . Enid was still gently censorious , though with her range of criticism so deflected by the huge exception to be made for her daughter that her fault - finding had an odd remoteness : and Hendrik Drover , Kate guessed , would be as easily shocked as of old by allusions to the “
18699	18914	18695	18695	they	732	” , though what they did at home was so vividly present to him in Lilla ’s person , and in the fact of Joe Tresselton ’s having married a Fourteenth Street Shriner , and a divorced one at that . It was all too bewildering for a poor exile to come to terms with -- Mrs. Clephane could only smile and listen , and be thankful that her own case was so evidently included in the new range of their indulgence . But the young people -- what did they think ? That would be the interesting thing to know . They had all , she gathered , far more interests and ideas than had scantily furnished her own youth , but all so broken up , scattered , and perpetually interrupted by the strenuous labour of their endless forms of sport , that they reminded her of a band of young entomologists , equipped with the newest thing in nets , but in far too great a hurry ever to catch anything . Yet perhaps it seemed so only to the slower motions of middle - age . Kate ’s glance wandered from Lilla Gates , the most obvious and least interesting of the group , to Nollie Shriner ( one of the “
18916	19304	18257	18257	she	95	” Fourteenth Street Shriners ) ; Nollie Shriner first , then Nollie Haverford , wife of a strait - laced Albany Haverford , and now Nollie Tresselton , though she still looked , with her brown squirrel - face and slim little body , like a girl in the schoolroom . Yes , even Nollie seemed to be in a great hurry ; one felt her perpetually ordering and sorting and marshalling things in her mind , and the fact , Kate presently perceived , now and then gave an odd worn look of fixity to her uncannily youthful face . Kate wondered when there was ever time to enjoy anything , with that perpetual alarm - clock in one ’s breast . Her glance travelled on to her own daughter . Anne seemed eager too , but not at such a pace , or about such a multiplicity of unrelated things . Perhaps , though , it was only the fact of being taller , statelier -- old - fashioned words still fitted Anne -- which gave her that air of boyish aloofness . But no ; it was the mystery of her eyes -- those eyes which , as Kate had told her , she had chosen for herself from some forgotten ancestral treasury into which none of the others had dipped . Between olive and brown , but flecked with golden lights , a little too deep - set , the lower lid flowing up smooth and flat from the cheek , and the black lashes as evenly set as the microscopic plumes in a Peruvian feather - ornament ; and above them , too prominent , even threatening , yet melting at times to curves of maiden wonder , the obstinate brows of old Mrs. Clephane . What did those eyes portend ? Kate Clephane glanced away , frightened at the riddle , and absorbed herself in the preoccupying fact that the only way to tell the Drovers from the Tresseltons was to remember that the Drovers ’ noses were even smaller than the Tresseltons ’ ( but _ would _ that help , if one met one of either tribe alone ? ) . She was roused by hearing Enid Drover question plaintively , as the ladies regained the drawing - room : “
19318	19362	19314	19314	Anne	95	” The women formed an interrogative group around Mrs. Clephane , who found herself suddenly being scrutinized as if for a verdict . She cast a puzzled glance at Anne , and her daughter slipped an arm through hers but addressed Mrs. Drover . “
19405	19434	19439	19440	Aunt Kate	161	” Mrs. Drover heaved a faint sigh of relief , but her daughter , shrugging impatient shoulders out of her too - willing shoulder - straps , grumbled : “
19459	19464	19444	19444	You	0	” Nollie Tresselton smiled . “
19478	19483	19469	19469	Lilla	153	” Lilla shrugged again . “
19505	19506	19495	19495	I	0	” “
19514	19515	19495	19495	I	0	” “
19546	19593	19532	19532	You	0	” She stood there , large and fair , the features of her small inexpressive face so like her mother ’s , the lines of her relaxed inviting body so different from Mrs. Drover ’s righteous curves . Her painted eyes rested curiously on Mrs. Clephane . “
19613	19636	19611	19611	you	737	” she asked the company with simplicity . There was a stricken pause . Kate filled it by saying with a laugh : “
19663	19679	19647	19647	I	0	” Lilla ’s stare deepened ; she seemed hardly able to take the statement in . “
19692	19733	19684	19684	you	737	” she questioned , after an apparently hopeless search for alternatives . Mrs. Drover had grown pink and pursed - up ; even Nollie Tresselton ’s quick smile seemed congealed . But Kate felt herself carrying it off on wings . “
19761	19803	19804	19805	A gentleman	1443	” She saw Anne colour a little , and felt the quick pressure of her arm . That they should have found each other again , she and Anne ! The butler threw open the drawing - room door with solemnity . “
19829	19830	19825	19825	madam	744	” “
19833	19885	19825	19825	madam	744	” said Lilla , leaping upon her fan and vanity bag . She was out of the room before the butler had rounded off his sentence . Mrs. Drover , her complacency restored , sank down on a plump Clephane sofa that corresponded in richness and ponderosity with her own person . “
19892	20132	19825	19825	madam	744	” she sighed ; then , with a freer breath , addressed herself to sympathetic enquiries as to Mrs. Clephane ’s voyage . It was evident that , as far as the family were concerned , Anne ’s mother had been born again , seven days earlier , on the gang - plank of the liner that had brought her home . On these terms they were all delighted to have her back ; and Mrs. Drover declared herself particularly thankful that the voyage had been so smooth . V. Smoothness , Kate Clephane could see , was going to mark the first stage of her re - embarkation on the waters of life . The truth came to her , after that first evening , with the surprised discovery that the family had refrained from touching on her past not so much from prudery , or discretion even , as because such retrogressions were jolting uncomfortable affairs , and the line of least resistance flowed forward , not back . She had been right in guessing that her questions as to what people thought of her past were embarrassing to Landers , but wrong in the interpretation of his embarrassment . Like every one else about her , he was caught up in the irresistible flow of existence , which somehow reminded her less of a mighty river tending seaward than of a moving stairway revolving on itself . “
20142	20425	19825	19825	madam	744	” she mused . But such thoughts barely lit on her tired mind and were gone . In the first days , after she had grasped ( without seeking its explanation ) the fact that she need no longer be on her guard , that henceforth there would be nothing to conjure away , or explain , or disguise , her chief feeling was one of illimitable relief . The rapture with which she let herself sink into the sensation showed her for the first time how tired she was , and for how long she had been tired . It was almost as if this sense of relaxation were totally new to her , so far back did her memory have to travel to recover a time when she had not waked to apprehension , and fallen asleep rehearsing fresh precautions for the morrow . In the first years of her marriage there had been the continual vain effort to adapt herself to her husband ’s point of view , to her mother - in - law ’s standards , to all the unintelligible ritual with which they barricaded themselves against the alarming business of living . After that had come the bitterness of her first disenchantment , and the insatiable longing to be back on the nursery floor with Anne ; then , through all the ensuing years , the many austere and lonely years , and the few consumed with her last passion , the ever - recurring need of one form of vigilance or another , the effort to keep hold of something that might at any moment slip from her , whether it were her painfully - regained “
20427	20808	19825	19825	madam	744	” or the lover for whom she had forgone it . Yes ; as she looked back , she saw herself always with taut muscles and the grimace of ease ; always pretending that she felt herself free , and secretly knowing that the prison of her marriage had been liberty compared with what she had exchanged it for . That was as far as her thoughts travelled in the first days . She abandoned herself with the others to the flood of material ease , the torrent of facilities on which they were all embarked . She had been scornful of luxury when it had symbolized the lack of everything else ; now that it was an adjunct of her recovered peace she began to enjoy it with the rest , and to feel that the daily perfection of her breakfast - tray , the punctual renewal of the flowers in her sitting - room , the inexhaustible hot water in her bath , the swift gliding of Anne ’s motor , and the attentions of her household of servants , were essential elements of this new life . At last she was at rest . Even the nature of her sleep was changed . Waking one morning -- not with a jerk , but slowly , voluntarily , as it were -- out of a soundless , dreamless night , a miraculous draught of sleep , she understood that for years even her rest had been unrestful . She recalled the uncertainty and apprehension always woven through her dreams , the sudden nocturnal wakings to a blinding , inextinguishable sense of her fate , her future , her past ; and the shallow turbid half - consciousness of her morning sleep , which would leave her , when she finally woke from it , emptied of all power of action , all hope and joy . Then every sound that broke the night - hush had been irritating , had pierced her rest like an insect ’s nagging hum ; now the noises that accompanied her falling asleep and awakening seemed to issue harmoniously out of the silence , and the late and early roar of Fifth Avenue to rock her like the great reiterations of the sea . “
20820	21231	19825	19825	madam	744	” she repeated to herself , like a botanist arrested by an unknown flower , and at once guessing it to be the rare exquisite thing he has spent half his life in seeking . Of course she would not have felt any of these things if Anne had not been the Anne she was . It was from Anne ’s presence , her smile , her voice , the mystery of her eyes even , that the healing flowed . If Kate Clephane had an apprehension left , it was her awe -- almost -- of that completeness of Anne ’s . Was it possible , humanly possible , that one could cast away one ’s best treasure , and come back after nearly twenty years to find it there , not only as rare as one had remembered it , but ripened , enriched , as only beautiful things are enriched and ripened by time ? It was as if one had set out some delicate plant under one ’s window , so that it might be an object of constant vigilance , and then gone away , leaving it unwatched , unpruned , unwatered -- how could one hope to find more than a dead stick in the dust when one returned ? But Anne was real ; she was not a mirage or a mockery ; as the days passed , and her mother ’s life and hers became adjusted to each other , Kate felt as if they were two parts of some delicate instrument which fitted together as perfectly as if they had never been disjoined -- as if Anne were that other half of her life , the half she had dreamed of and never lived . To see Anne living it would be almost the same as if it were her own ; would be better , almost ; since she would be there , with her experience , and tenderness , to hold out a guiding hand , to help shape the perfection she had sought and missed . These thoughts came back to her with particular force on the evening of Anne ’s reappearance at the Opera . During the weeks since old Mrs. Clephane ’s death the Clephane box had stood severely empty ; even when the Opera House was hired for some charity entertainment , Anne sent a cheque but refused to give the box . It was awfully “
21233	21251	19825	19825	madam	744	” , as Nollie Tresselton said ; but somehow it suited Anne , was as much in her “
21253	21263	19825	19825	madam	744	” as the close braids folded about her temples . “
21284	21543	21279	21279	Anne	95	” Nollie concluded . Tonight the period of formal mourning for old Mrs. Clephane was over , and Anne was to go to the Opera with her mother . She had asked the Joe Tresseltons and her guardian to join them first at a little dinner , and Kate Clephane had gone up to dress rather earlier than usual . It was her first public appearance , also , and -- as on each occasion of her new life when she came on some unexpected survival of her youth , a face , a voice , a point of view , a room in which the furniture had not been changed -- she was astonished , and curiously agitated , at setting out from the very same house for the very same Opera box . The only difference would be in the mode of progression ; she remembered the Parisian landau and sixteen - hand chestnuts with glittering plated harness that had waited at the door in her early married days . Then she had a vision of her own toilet , of the elaborate business it used to be : Aline ’s predecessor , with cunning fingers , dividing and coiling the generous ripples of her hair , and building nests of curls about the temples and in the nape ; then the dash up in her dressing - gown to Anne ’s nursery for a last kiss , and the hurrying back to get into her splendid brocade , to fasten the diamond coronet , the ruby “
21545	21825	21279	21279	Anne	95	” , the triple pearls . John Clephane was fond of jewels , and particularly proud of his wife ’s , first because he had chosen them , and secondly because he had given them to her . She sometimes thought he really admired her only when she had them all on , and she often reflected ironically on Esther ’s wifely guile in donning her regal finery before she ventured to importune Ahasuerus . It certainly increased Kate Clephane ’s importance in her husband ’s eyes to know that , when she entered her box , no pearls could hold their own against hers except Mrs. Beaufort ’s and old Mrs. Goldmere ’s . It was years since Kate Clephane had thought of those jewels . She smiled at the memory , and at the contrast between the unobtrusive dress Aline had just prepared for her , and all those earlier splendours . The jewels , she supposed , were Anne ’s now ; since modern young girls dressed as richly as their elders , Anne had no doubt had them reset for her own use . Mrs. Clephane closed her eyes with a smile of pleasure , picturing Anne ( as she had not yet seen her ) with bare arms and shoulders , and the orient of the pearls merging in that of her young skin . It was lucky that Anne was tall enough to look her best in jewels . Thence the mother ’s fancy wandered to the effect Anne must produce on other imaginations ; on those , particularly , of young men . Was she already , as they used to say , “
21827	21864	21279	21279	Anne	95	” ? Among the young men Mrs. Clephane had seen , either calling at the house , or in the course of informal dinners at the Tresseltons ’ , the Drovers ’ , and other cousins or “
21868	21937	21939	21941	an older man	748	” , she had remarked none who seemed to fix her daughter ’s attention . But there had been , as yet , few opportunities : the mitigated mourning for old Mrs. Clephane did at least seclude them from general society , and when a girl as aloof as Anne was attracted , the law of contrasts might draw her to some one unfamiliar and undulled by propinquity . “
21945	22104	21939	21941	an older man	748	” Kate considered . She thought of Anne ’s half - daughterly , half - feminine ways with her former guardian , and then shrugged away the possibility that her old stolid Fred could exercise a sentimental charm . Yet the young men of Anne ’s generation , those her mother had hitherto met , seemed curiously undifferentiated and immature , as if they had been kept too long in some pure and enlightened school , eternally preparing for a life into which their parents and professors could never decide to let them plunge .... It struck Mrs. Clephane that Chris , when she first met him , must have been about the age of these beautiful inarticulate athletes ... and Heaven knew how many lives he had already run through ! As he said himself , he felt every morning when he woke as if he had come into a new fortune , and had somehow got to “
22109	22438	21939	21941	an older man	748	” before night . Kate Clephane sat up and brushed her hand over her eyes . It was the first time Chris had been present to her , in that insistent immediate way , since her return to New York . She had thought of him , of course -- how could she cast even a glance over her own past without seeing him there , woven into its very texture ? But he seemed to have receded to the plane of that past : from his torturing actual presence her new life had delivered her .... She pressed both hands against her eyes , as if to crush and disperse the image stealthily forming ; then she rose and went into her bedroom , where , a moment before , she had heard Aline laying out her dress . The maid had finished and gone ; the bedroom was empty . The change of scene , the mere passage from one room to another , the sight of the evening dress and opera - cloak on the bed , and of Beatrice Cenci looking down on them through her perpetual sniffle , sufficed to recall Kate to the present . She turned to the dressing - table , and noticed a box which had been placed before her mirror . It was of ebony and citron - wood , embossed with agates and cornelians , and heavily clasped with chiselled silver ; and from the summit of the lid a silver Cupid bent his shaft at her . Kate broke into a faint laugh . How well she remembered that box ! She did not have to lift the lid to see its padded trays and tufted sky - blue satin lining ! It was old Mrs. Clephane ’s jewel - box , and on Kate ’s marriage the dowager had solemnly handed it over to her daughter - in - law with all that it contained . “
22446	22509	22442	22442	Anne	95	” Kate conjectured , amused by the sight of one more odd survival in that museum of the past which John Clephane ’s house had become . A little key hung on one of the handles , and she put it in the lock , and saw all her jewels lying before her . On a slip of paper Anne had written : “
22524	22687	22742	22742	Nollie	154	” * * * * * As she entered the opera box Kate Clephane felt as if the great central chandelier were raying all its shafts upon her , as if she were somehow caught up into and bound on the wheel of its devouring blaze . But only for a moment -- after that it seemed perfectly natural to be sitting there with her daughter and Nollie Tresselton , backed by the usual cluster of white waistcoats . After all , in this new existence it was Anne who mattered , not Anne ’s mother ; instantly , after the first plunge , Mrs. Clephane felt herself merged in the blessed anonymity of motherhood . She had never before understood how exposed and defenceless her poor unsupported personality had been through all the lonely years . Her eyes rested on Anne with a new tenderness ; the glance crossed Nollie Tresselton ’s , and the two triumphed in their shared admiration . “
22697	22736	22692	22693	no one	750	” their four eyes told each other . Anne looked round and intercepted the exchange . Her eyes smiled too , and turned with a childish pleasure to the pearls hanging down over her mother ’s black dress . “
22744	22750	22742	22742	Nollie	154	” Young Mrs. Tresselton laughed . “
22759	22889	22751	22751	You	751	” she said . Mrs. Clephane closed her lids for an instant ; she wanted to drop a curtain between herself and the stir and brightness , and to keep in her eyes the look of Anne ’s as they fell on the pearls . The episode of the jewels had moved the mother strangely . It had brought Anne closer than a hundred confidences or endearments . As Kate sat there in the dark , she saw , detached against the blackness of her closed lids , a child stumbling with unsteady steps across a windy beach , a funny flushed child with sand in her hair and in the creases of her fat legs , who clutched to her breast something she was bringing to her mother . “
22895	23150	23151	23151	I	0	” she said solemnly , opening her pink palms on a dead star - fish . Kate saw again the child ’s rapturous look , and felt the throb of catching her up , star - fish and all , and devouring with kisses the rosy body and tousled head . In themselves the jewels were nothing . If Anne had handed her a bit of coal -- or another dead star - fish -- with that look and that intention , the gift would have seemed as priceless . Probably it would have been impossible to convey to Anne how indifferent her mother had grown to the Clephane jewels . In her other life -- that confused intermediate life which now seemed so much more remote than the day when the little girl had given her the star - fish -- jewels , she supposed , might have pleased her , as pretty clothes had , or flowers , or anything that flattered the eye . Yet she could never remember having regretted John Clephane ’s jewels ; and now they would have filled her with disgust , with abhorrence almost , had they not , in the interval , become Anne ’s .... It was the girl who gave them their beauty , made them exquisite to the mother ’s sight and touch , as though they had been a part of her daughter ’s loveliness , the expression of something she could not speak . Mrs. Clephane suddenly exclaimed to herself : “
23155	23443	23151	23151	I	0	” It was a queer , almost blasphemous , fancy -- but it came to her so . She was rewarded for having given up her daughter ; if she had not , could she ever have known such a moment as this ? She had been too careless and impetuous in her own youth to be worthy to form and guide this rare creature ; and while she seemed to be rushing blindly to her destruction , Providence had saved the best part of her in saving Anne . All these scrupulous self - controlled people -- Enid and Hendrik Drover , Fred Landers , even the arch enemy , old Mrs. Clephane -- had taken up the task she had flung aside , and carried it out as she could never have done . And she had somehow run the mad course allotted to her , and come out of it sane and sound , to find them all waiting there to give her back her daughter . It was incredible , but there it was . She bowed her head in self - abasement . The box door was opening and shutting softly , on the stage voices and instruments soared and fell . She did not know how long she sat there in a kind of brooding rapture . But presently she was roused by hearing a different voice at her elbow . She half opened her eyes , and saw a newcomer sitting by Anne . It was one of the young men who came to the house ; his fresh blunt face was as inexpressive as a football ; he might have been made by a manufacturer of sporting - goods . “
23491	23492	23506	23506	he	753	” “
23497	23502	23506	23506	he	753	” Anne murmured ironically . “
23540	23773	23527	23527	he	753	” Kate Clephane , watching her daughter through narrowed lids , perceived a subtle change in her face . Anne did not blush -- that close - textured skin of hers seldom revealed the motions of her blood . Her delicate profile remained shut , immovable ; she merely lowered her lids as if to keep in a vision . It was Kate ’s own gesture , and the mother recognized it with a start . She had been right , then ; there was some one -- some one whom Anne had to close her eyes to see ! But who was he ? Why had he been too shy to come to the box ? Where did he come from , and whither had he fled ? Kate glanced at Nollie Tresselton , wondering if she had overheard ; but Nollie , in the far corner of the box , leaned forward , deep in the music . Joe Tresselton had vanished , Landers slumbered in the rear . With a little tremor of satisfaction , Kate saw that she had her daughter ’s secret to herself : if there was no one to enlighten her about it at least there was no one to share it with her , and she was glad . For the first time she felt a little nearer to Anne than all the others . “
23778	23782	23527	23527	he	753	” she thought , “
23795	23851	23527	23527	he	753	” But there are no real distances nowadays , and she reflected with an inward smile that the fugitive would doubtless soon reappear , and her curiosity be satisfied . That evening , when Anne followed her into her bedroom , Mrs. Clephane opened the wardrobe in which she had placed the jewel - box . “
23878	23885	23868	23868	I	0	” The girl ’s face clouded . “
23900	23901	23898	23898	yours	758	” “
23925	23930	23933	23933	your	1477	” she paused , half smiling--“a
23936	23960	23963	23963	my	0	” She had tried to say the word lightly , but it echoed on through the silence like a peal of silver bells . “
23972	24029	23967	23967	I	0	” said Anne , laughing joyously , and catching her mother in her arms . It was the first time she had made so impulsive a movement ; Kate Clephane , trembling a little , held her close . It brought the girl nearer , made her less aloof , to hear that familiar old denial . “
24035	24040	24041	24041	she	0	” the mother thought , “
24049	24564	24041	24041	she	0	” VI . Kate Clephane lay awake all night thinking of the man who had been too shy to come into the box . Her sense of security , of permanence , was gone . She understood now that it had been based on the idea that her life would henceforth go on just as it had for the two months since her return ; that she and Anne would always remain side by side . The idea was absurd , of course ; if she followed it up , her mind recoiled from it . To keep Anne for the rest of her life unchanged , and undesirous of change -- the aspiration was inconceivable . She wanted for her daughter the common human round , no more , but certainly no less . Only she did not want her to marry yet -- not till they two had grown to know each other better , till Kate had had time to establish herself in her new life . So she put it to herself ; but she knew that what she felt was just an abject fear of change , more change -- of being uprooted again , cast once more upon her own resources . No ! She could not picture herself living alone in a little house in New York , dependent on Drovers and Tresseltons , and on the good Fred Landers , for her moral sustenance . To be with Anne , to play the part of Anne ’s mother -- the one part , she now saw , that fate had meant her for -- that was what she wanted with all her starved and world - worn soul . To be the background , the atmosphere , of her daughter ’s life ; to depend on Anne , to feel that Anne depended on her ; it was the one perfect companionship she had ever known , the only close tie unmarred by dissimulation and distrust . The mere restfulness of it had made her contracted soul expand as if it were sinking into a deep warm bath . Now the sense of restfulness was gone . From the moment when she had seen Anne ’s lids drop on that secret vision , the mother had known that her days of quietude were over . Anne ’s choice might be perfect ; she , Kate Clephane , might live out the rest of her days in peace between Anne and Anne ’s husband . But the mere possibility of a husband made everything incalculable again . The morning brought better counsel . There was Anne herself , in her riding - habit , aglow from an early canter , and bringing in her mother ’s breakfast , without a trace of mystery in her clear eyes . There was the day ’s pleasant routine , easy and insidious , the planning and adjusting of engagements , notes to be answered , invitations to be sent out ; the habitual took Mrs. Clephane into its soothing hold . “
24568	24572	24041	24041	she	0	” she reflected , “
24585	25347	24573	24574	young men	1746	” Probably the whole thing had been some cryptic chaff of the youth with the football face ; Nollie , indirectly , might enlighten her . Indirectly ; for it was clear to Kate that whatever she learned about her daughter must be learned through observing her , and not through questioning others . The mother could not picture herself as having any rights over the girl , as being , under that roof , anything more than a privileged guest . Anne ’s very insistence on treating her as the mistress of the house only emphasized her sense of not being so by right : it was the verbal courtesy of the Spaniard who puts all his possessions at the disposal of a casual visitor . Not that there was anything in Anne ’s manner to suggest this ; but that to Kate it seemed inherent in the situation . It was absurd to assume that her mere return to John Clephane ’s house could invest her , in any one else ’s eyes , and much less in her own , with the authority she had lost in leaving it ; she would never have dreamed of behaving as if she thought so . Her task , she knew , was gradually , patiently , to win back , of all she had forfeited , the one thing she really valued : her daughter ’s love and confidence . The love , in a measure , was hers already ; could the confidence fail to follow ? Meanwhile , at any rate , she could be no more than the fondest of lookers - on , the discreetest of listeners ; and for the moment she neither saw nor heard anything to explain that secret tremor of Anne ’s eyelids . At the Joe Tresseltons ’ , a few nights later , she had hoped for a glimpse , a hint . Nollie had invited mother and daughter ( with affectionate insistence on the mother ’s presence ) to a little evening party at which some one who was not Russian was to sing -- for Nollie was original in everything . The Joe Tresseltons had managed to lend a freshly picturesque air to a dull old Tresselton house near Washington Square , of which the stable had become a studio , and other apartments suffered like transformations , without too much loss of character . It was typical of Nollie that she could give an appearance of stability to her modern furnishings , just as her modern manner kept its repose . The party was easy and amusing , but even Lilla Gates ( whom Nollie always included ) took her tone from the mistress of the house , and , dressed with a kind of savage soberness , sat there in her heavy lustreless beauty , bored but triumphant . It was evident that , though at Nollie ’s she was not in her element , she would not for the world have been left out . Kate Clephane , while the music immobilized the groups scattered about the great shadowy room , found herself scanning them with a fresh intensity of attention . She no longer thought of herself as an object of curiosity to any of these careless self - engrossed young people ; she had learned that a woman of her age , however conspicuous her past , and whatever her present claims to notice , is fated to pass unremarked in a society where youth so undisputedly rules . The discovery had come with a slight shock ; then she blessed the anonymity which made observation so much easier . Only -- what was there to observe ? Again the sameness of the American Face encompassed her with its innocent uniformity . How many of them it seemed to take to make up a single individuality ! Most of them were like the miles and miles between two railway stations . She saw again , with gathering wonder , that one may be young and handsome and healthy and eager , and yet unable , out of such rich elements , to evolve a personality . Her thoughts wandered back to the shabby faces peopling her former life . She knew every seam of their shabbiness , but now for the first time she seemed to see that they had been worn down by emotions and passions , however selfish , however sordid , and not merely by ice - water and dyspepsia . “
25357	25361	25362	25362	they	176	” she reflected , “
25374	25395	25396	25396	You	762	” Landers came up as the thought flashed through her mind , and apparently caught its reflection in her smile . “
25417	25426	25396	25396	You	762	” he asked , sitting down beside her . “
25463	25477	25455	25455	I	0	” He reddened a little , as if unaccustomed to such insistent scrutiny . “
25482	25483	25455	25455	I	0	” “
25512	25513	25499	25499	I	0	” “
25533	25541	25523	25523	I	0	” he said with a faint grimace . “
25562	25569	25553	25553	I	0	” she added abruptly and unguardedly , “
25588	25635	25586	25586	Anne	95	” She was vexed with herself that the words should have slipped out , and yet not altogether sorry . After all , one could always trust Landers to hold his tongue -- and almost always to understand . His smile showed that he understood now . “
25666	25677	25654	25655	Sister Anne	95	” A breath of relief expanded the mother ’s heart . “
25708	25709	25721	25721	she	95	” “
25729	25734	25721	25721	she	95	” He looked away . “
25744	25748	25749	25749	I	0	” he added . “
25764	25860	25749	25749	I	0	” Kate Clephane glanced at him quickly ; his ingenuous countenance wore an unaccustomed shadow . She remembered that , in old days , John Clephane had always jokingly declared -- in a tone proclaiming the matter to be one mentionable only as a joke -- that Fred Landers was in love with her ; and she said to herself that the lesson her old friend referred to was perhaps the one she had unwittingly given him when she went away with another man . It was on the tip of her tongue to exclaim : “
25887	25982	25985	25985	I	0	” but she checked herself with a start . Why , in the very act of thinking of her daughter , had she suddenly strayed away into thinking of Chris ? It was the first time it had happened to her to confront the two images , and she felt as if she had committed a sort of profanation . She took refuge in another thought that Landers ’s last words had suggested -- the thought that if she herself had matured late , why so might Anne . The idea was faintly reassuring . “
25993	26000	25985	25985	I	0	” she said , answering him . “
26025	26026	26029	26030	these mothers	770	” “
26032	26375	26029	26030	these mothers	770	” he laughed , his face smoothing out into its usual guileless lines . The music was over . The groups flowed past them toward the little tables in another picturesque room , and Lilla Gates swept by in a cluster of guffawing youths . She seemed to have attracted all the kindred spirits in the room , and her sluggish stare was shot with provocation . Ah , there was another mystery ! No one explained Lilla -- every one seemed to take her for granted . Not that it really mattered ; Kate had seen enough of Anne to feel sure she would never be in danger of falling under Lilla ’s influence . The perils in wait for her would wear a subtler form . But , as a matter of curiosity , and a possible light on the new America , Kate would have liked to know why her husband ’s niece -- surprising offshoot of the prudent Clephanes and stolid Drovers -- had been singled out , in this new easy - going society , to be at once reproved and countenanced . Lilla in herself was too uninteresting to stimulate curiosity ; but as a symptom she might prove enlightening . Only , here again , Kate had the sense that she , of all the world , was least in a position to ask questions . What if people should turn around and ask them about _ her _ ? Since she had been living under her old roof , and at her daughter ’s side , the mere suggestion made her tremble . It was curious -- and she herself was aware of it -- how quickly , unconsciously almost , she had slipped at last into the very attitude the Clephanes had so long tried to force upon her : the attitude of caution and conservatism . Her glance , in following Lilla , caught Fred Landers ’s , and he smiled again , but with a slight constraint . Instantly she thought : “
26425	26433	26417	26417	they	772	” Well , that was what people called “
26439	26518	26524	26524	mother	1508	” , she supposed ; would no one ever again scribble anything unguardedly on hers ? She felt indescribably alone . On the way home the mere feeling of Anne ’s arm against hers drew her out of her solitariness . After all , she had only to wait . The new life was but a few weeks old ; and already Anne ’s nearness seemed to fill it . If only she could keep Anne near enough ! “
26536	26542	26528	26528	we	775	” the girl asked suddenly . “
26551	26564	26528	26528	we	775	” She thought she felt Anne ’s surprised glance in the darkness . “
26623	26624	26612	26613	Uncle Fred	94	” “
26655	26671	26672	26672	You	773	” Her voice shook with the avowal . She was answered by a closer pressure . “
26684	26700	26676	26676	I	0	” She was conscious in Anne , mysteriously , of a tension answering her own . “
26713	26719	26676	26676	I	0	” the girl said joyously . “
26725	26822	26676	26676	I	0	” Kate Clephane thought ; but dared not speak . Her hand on Anne ’s , she sat silent , feeling her child ’s heart tremble nearer . VII . Every one noticed how beautifully it worked ; the way , as Fred Landers said , she and Anne had hit it off from their first look at each other on the deck of the steamer . Enid Drover was almost emotional about it , one evening when she and Kate sat alone in the Clephane drawing - room . It was after one of Anne ’s “
26824	26847	26892	26892	I	0	” dinners , and the other guests , with Anne herself , had been whirled off to some form of midnight entertainment . “
26883	26891	26874	26874	she	778	” Kate felt herself redden with pride . “
26901	26913	26874	26874	she	778	” Mrs. Drover continued , with her heavy - stepping simplicity . “
26924	26949	26950	26950	Anne	95	” But she pulled up , apparently feeling that , in some obscure manner , she might be offending where she sought to please . “
26964	26973	26950	26950	Anne	95	” A sigh came from her adipose depths . “
27007	27064	27080	27080	you	1477	” Kate felt an inward glow of satisfaction . The irony of the situation hardly touched her : the fact that the youth and elasticity she had clung to so desperately should prove one of the chief assets of her new venture . It was beginning to seem natural that everything should lead up to Anne . “
27124	27125	27106	27106	She	778	” “
27128	27134	27106	27106	She	778	well”--it was so easy to be generous!--“that
27171	27210	27159	27160	Dr. Johnson	178	” Mrs. Drover gave her sister - in - law a puzzled look . Her mind seldom retained more than one word in any sentence , and her answer was based on the reaction that particular word provoked . “
27213	27215	27159	27160	Dr. Johnson	178	” she murmured--“is
27257	27316	27159	27160	Dr. Johnson	178	” Nothing could have given Kate Clephane greater confidence in her own success than this little talk with Enid Drover . She had been feeling her way so patiently , so stealthily almost , among the out - works and defences of her daughter ’s character ; and here she was actually instated in the citadel . Anne ’s “
27320	27619	27159	27160	Dr. Johnson	178	” strengthened the conviction . Mrs. Clephane had not been allowed to see the studio ; Anne and Nollie and Joe Tresselton , for a breathless week , had locked themselves in with nails and hammers and pots of paint , sealing their ears against all questioning . Then one afternoon the doors were opened , and Kate , coming out of the winter twilight , found herself in a great half - lit room with a single wide window overlooking the reaches of the Sound all jewelled and netted with lights , the fairy span of the Brooklyn Bridge , and the dark roof - forest of the intervening city . It all seemed strangely significant and mysterious in that disguising dusk -- full of shadows , distances , invitations . Kate leaned in the window , surprised at this brush of the wings of poetry . In the room , Anne had had the good taste to let the sense of space prolong itself . It looked more like a great library waiting for its books than a modern studio ; as though the girl had measured the distance between that mighty nocturne and her own timid attempts , and wanted the implements of her art to pass unnoticed . They were sitting -- Mrs. Clephane , the Joe Tresseltons and one or two others -- about the tea - cups set out at one end of a long oak table , when the door opened and Lilla Gates appeared , tawny and staring , in white furs and big pendulous earrings . She brought with her a mingled smell of cigarettes and Houbigant , and as she stood there , circling the room with her sulky contemptuous gaze , Kate felt a movement of annoyance . “
27631	27649	27629	27629	Lilla	153	” she wondered , wincing a little as Anne ’s lips touched her cousin ’s mauve cheek . “
27660	27661	27658	27658	Lilla	153	” “
27673	27710	27664	27664	I	0	” said Lilla coolly . It was evidently her pride to be perpetually invited , perpetually swamped in a multiplicity of boring engagements . She looked about her again , and then dropped into an armchair . “
27721	27725	27711	27711	Mercy	179	” she remarked . “
27738	27739	27711	27711	Mercy	179	” “
27753	27763	27711	27711	Mercy	179	” Anne said , pointing to the great window . “
27805	27821	27822	27822	I	0	” she added , with a pounce toward the grand piano in a shadowy corner . “
27827	27835	27822	27822	I	0	” she pronounced . Nollie Tresselton laughed . “
27861	27862	27847	27847	You	153	” “
27886	28083	28084	28084	He	795	” She stood leaning against the piano , sipping the cock - tail some one had handed her , her head thrown back , and the light from a shaded lamp striking up at her columnar throat and the green glitter of her earrings , which suggested to Kate Clephane the poisonous antennæ of some giant insect . Anne stood close to her , slender , erect , her small head clasped in close braids , her hands hanging at her sides , dead - white against the straight dark folds of her dress . There was something distinctly unpleasant to Kate Clephane in the proximity of the two , and she rose and moved toward the piano . As she sat down before it , letting her hands drift into the opening bars of a half - remembered melody , she saw Lilla , in her vague lounging way , draw nearer to Anne , who held out a hand for the empty cock - tail glass . The gesture brought them so close that Lilla , slightly drooping her head , could let fall , hardly above her breath , but audibly to Kate : “
28102	28134	28089	28089	He	795	” Again Kate saw that quick drop of her daughter ’s lids ; this time it was accompanied by a just - perceptible tremor of the hand that received the glass . “
28139	28140	28137	28137	Lilla	153	” “
28167	28182	28183	28183	You	797	” Anne laughed -- the faintest half - pleased laugh of impatience and dismissal . “
28188	28210	28183	28183	You	797	” she said . Nollie Tresselton , in the interval , had glided up and slipped an arm through Lilla ’s . “
28226	28254	28255	28255	I	0	” Her little brown face had the worn sharp look it often took on when she was mothering Lilla . But Lilla ’s feet were firmly planted . “
28267	28383	28255	28255	I	0	” One of the young men hastened to supply her , and Anne turned to her other guests . A few minutes later the Tresseltons and Lilla went away , and one by one the remaining visitors followed , leaving mother and daughter alone in the recovered serenity of the empty room . But there was no serenity in Kate . That half - whispered exchange between Lilla Gates and Anne had stirred all her old apprehensions and awakened new ones . The idea that her daughter was one of Lilla ’s confidants was inexpressibly disturbing . Yet the more she considered , the less she knew how to convey her anxiety to her daughter . “
28401	28494	28395	28395	she	799	” For the first time she understood on what unknown foundations her fellowship with Anne was built . Were they solid ? Would they hold ? Was Anne ’s feeling for her more than a sudden girlish enthusiasm for an agreeable older woman , the kind of sympathy based on things one can enumerate , and may change one ’s mind about , rather than the blind warmth of habit ? She stood musing while Anne moved about the studio , putting away the music , straightening a picture here and there . “
28504	28509	28510	28510	Lilla	153	” Anne nodded joyously . “
28526	28527	28528	28529	Poor Lilla	180	” “
28570	28588	28528	28529	Poor Lilla	180	” Kate was relieved : there was no mistaking the half - disdainful pity of the tone . “
28599	28613	28528	28529	Poor Lilla	180	” she laughed , gathering up her furs . Anne echoed the laugh . “
28628	29502	28626	28626	mine	0	” she said ; and mother and daughter went gaily down the steep stairs . * * * * * The days , after that , moved on with the undefinable reassurance of habit . Kate Clephane was beginning to feel herself part of an old - established routine . She had tried to organize her life in such a way that it should fit into Anne ’s without awkward overlapping . Anne , nowadays , after her early canter , went daily to the studio and painted till lunch ; sometimes , as the days lengthened , she went back for another two hours ’ work in the afternoon . When the going was too bad for her morning ride she usually walked to the studio , and Kate sometimes walked with her , or went through the Park to meet her on her return . When she painted in the afternoon , Kate would occasionally drop in for tea , and they would return home together on foot in the dusk . But Mrs. Clephane was scrupulously careful not to intrude on her daughter ’s working - hours ; she held back , not with any tiresome display of discretion , but with the air of caring for her own independence too much not to respect Anne ’s . Sometimes , now that she had settled down into this new way of life , she was secretly aware of feeling a little lonely ; there were hours when the sense of being only a visitor in the house where her life ought to have been lived gave her the same drifting uprooted feeling which had been the curse of her other existence . It was not Anne ’s fault ; nor that , in this new life , every moment was not interesting and even purposeful , since each might give her the chance of serving Anne , pleasing Anne , in some way or another getting closer to Anne . But this very feeling took a morbid intensity from the fact of having no common memories , no shared associations , to feed on . Kate was frightened , sometimes , by its likeness to that other isolated and devouring emotion which her love for Chris had been . Everything might have been different , she thought , if she had had more to do , or more friends of her own to occupy her . But Anne ’s establishment , which had been her grandmother ’s , still travelled smoothly enough on its own momentum , and though the girl insisted that her mother was now the head of the house , the headship involved little more than ordering dinner , and talking over linen and carpets and curtains with old Mrs. Clephane ’s house - keeper . Then , as to friends -- was it because she was too much engrossed in her daughter to make any ? Or because her life had been too incommunicably different from that of her bustling middle - aged contemporaries , absorbed by local and domestic questions she had no part in ? Or had she been too suddenly changed from a self - centred woman , insatiable for personal excitements , into that new being , a mother , her centre of gravity in a life not hers ? She did not know ; she felt only that she no longer had time for anything but motherhood , and must be content to bridge over , as best she could , the unoccupied intervals . And , after all , the intervals were not many . Her daughter never appeared without instantly filling up every crevice of the present , and overflowing into the past and the future , so that , even in the mother ’s rare lapses into despondency , life without Anne , like life before Anne , had become unthinkable . She was revolving this for the thousandth time as she turned into the Park one afternoon to meet Anne on the latter ’s way homeward . The days were already much longer ; the difference in the light , and that premature languor of the air which comes , in America , before the sleeping earth seems to expect it , made Mrs. Clephane feel that the year had turned , that a new season was opening in her new life . She walked on with the vague sense of confidence in the future which the first touch of spring gives . The worst of the way was past -- how easily , how smoothly to the feet ! Where misunderstanding and failure had been so probable , she was increasingly sure of having understood and succeeded . And already she and Anne were making delightful plans for the spring .... Ahead of her , in a transverse alley , she was disagreeably surprised by the sight of Lilla Gates . There was no mistaking that tall lounging figure , though it was moving slowly away from her . Lilla at that hour in the Park ? It seemed curious and improbable . Yet Lilla it was ; and Mrs. Clephane ’s conclusion was drawn immediately . “
29509	29839	29840	29840	Chris	88	” Whoever it was had not come ; the perspective beyond Lilla was empty . After a moment she hastened her step , and vanished behind a clump of evergreens at the crossing of the paths . Kate did not linger to watch for her reappearance . The incident was too trifling to fix the attention ; after all , what had one ever expected of Lilla but that she might be found loitering in unlikely places , in quest of objectionable people ? There was nothing new in that -- nor did Kate even regret not having a glimpse of the objectionable person . In her growing reassurance about Anne , Lilla ’s affairs had lost whatever slight interest they once offered . She walked on -- but her mood was altered . The sight of Lilla lingering in that deserted path had called up old associations . She remembered meetings of the same kind -- but was it her own young figure she saw fading down those far - off perspectives ? Well -- if it were , let it go ! She owned no kinship with that unhappy ghost . Serene , middle - aged , respected and respectable , she walked on again out of that vanishing past into the warm tangible present . And at any moment now she might meet Anne . She had turned down a wide walk leading to one of the Fifth Avenue entrances of the Park . One could see a long way ahead ; there were people coming and going . Two women passed , with some noisy children racing before them , a milliner ’s boy , whistling , his boxes slung over his shoulder , a paralytic pushing himself along in a wheeled chair ; then , coming toward her from the direction of Fifth Avenue , a man who half - stopped , recognized her , and raised his hat . BOOK II . VIII . “
29842	29903	29840	29840	Chris	88	” she said . She felt herself trembling all over ; then , abruptly , mysteriously , and in the very act of uttering his name , she ceased to tremble , and it came flooding in on her with a shock of wonder that the worst was already over -- that at last she was going to be free . “
29908	29936	29840	29840	Chris	88	” she heard him saying , in that round full voice which always became fuller and more melodious when it had any inner uncertainty to mask ; and “
29940	29944	29840	29840	Chris	88	” she thought , “
29955	29959	29952	29952	he	88	” He laughed . “
29969	29997	29960	29960	I	0	” he reiterated , as if explaining ; and with the laugh in her ears she still felt herself as lucidly , as incredibly remote from him . “
30000	30047	29960	29960	I	0	” she echoed , a little less sure of her speech than of her thoughts , and remembering how sometimes the smile in his eyes used to break up her words into little meaningless splinters that she could never put together again till he was gone . “
30063	30158	30159	30159	My	0	” And now she had him , for the first time , actually reddening and stammering as she herself used to do , and catching at the splinters of his own words ! Ah , the trick was done -- she could even see , as they continued to face each other in the searching spring light , that he had reddened , thickened , hardened -- as if the old Chris had been walled into this new one , and were not even looking at her out of the windows of his prison . “
30163	30328	30159	30159	My	0	” she echoed again , while the truth still danced in her ears : the truth that she was free , free , free -- away from him at last , far enough off to see him and judge him ! It must have been his bad taste -- the bad taste that could lead him into such an opening as that -- which , from the very first , she had felt in him , and tried not to feel , even when she was worshipping him most blindly . But , after all , if she felt so free , why be so cruel ? Ah , because the terror was still there -- it had only shifted its ground . What frightened her now was not the thought of their past but of their future . And she must not let him see that it frightened her . What had his last words been ? Ah , yes-- . She answered : “
30341	30349	30331	30331	I	0	” He lowered his voice to murmur : “
30359	30448	30351	30351	I	0	” Yes ; she remembered now ; it was always in emotional moments that his tact failed him , his subtlety vanished , and he seemed to be reciting speeches learned by heart out of some sentimental novel -- the very kind he was so clever at ridiculing . They continued to stand facing each other , their inspiration spent , as if waiting for the accident that had swept them together to whirl them apart again . Suddenly she risked ( since it was better to know ): “
30458	30469	30351	30351	I	0	” He shook his head with an air of melancholy . “
30581	30680	30562	30562	he	181	” She felt her tightened heart dilating . Baltimore was n’t very far away ; but it was far enough as long as he had anything to keep him there . She knew about Horace Maclew , an elderly wealthy bibliophile and philanthropist , with countless municipal and social interests in his own town , and a big country - place just outside it . No ; Mr. Maclew ’s private secretary was not likely to have many holidays . But how long would Chris resign himself to such drudgery ? She wanted to be kind and say : “
30688	30785	30685	30685	Your	0	” but she did n’t dare . Besides , he had probably left both phases far behind him , and there was no need , really , for her to concern herself with his new hobbies , whatever they might be . Of course she knew that he and she would have to stand there staring at one another till she made a gesture of dismissal ; but on what note was she to make it ? The natural thing ( since she felt so safe and easy with him ) would have been to say : “
30801	30957	30793	30793	you	0	” . But , with him , how could one be certain of not having such a suggestion taken literally ? Now that he had seen she was not afraid of him he would probably not be afraid of _ her _ ; if he wanted a good dinner , or an evening at the Opera , he ’d be as likely as not to call her up and ask for it . And suddenly , as they hung there , she caught , over his shoulder , a glimpse of another figure just turning into the Park from the same direction ; Anne , with her quick step , her intent inward air , as she always moved and looked when she had just left her easel . In another moment Anne would be upon them . Mrs. Clephane held out her hand : for a fraction of a second it lay in his . “
30978	30979	30962	30962	I	0	” “
30984	30992	30962	30962	I	0	” He dismissed it with a gesture . “
31001	31005	30994	30994	I	0	” he added ; “
31013	31033	30994	30994	I	0	” with a clever shifting of the emphasis . He paused a moment , and then risked a smile . “
31045	31056	31042	31042	you	0	” She threw her head back with an answering smile . “
31067	31138	31059	31059	I	0	” Thank heaven , an approaching group of people must have obstructed her daughter ’s view ! Mrs. Clephane hurried on , wanting to put as much distance as she could between herself and Chris ’s retreating figure before she came up with her daughter . When she did , she plunged straight into the girl ’s eyes , and saw that they were still turned on her inward vision . “
31141	31146	31059	31059	I	0	” she cried gaily , “
31164	31180	31147	31147	I	0	” Anne ’s soul rose slowly to the surface , shining out between deep lashes . “
31219	31241	31208	31208	one	247	” She slipped her arm in Kate ’s , and turned unresistingly as the latter guided her back toward Fifth Avenue . “
31273	32398	32399	32399	Lilla	153	” Mrs. Clephane explained . * * * * * All night long she lay awake in the great bed of the Clephane spare - room , and stared at Chris . While they still faced each other -- and after her first confused impression of his having thickened and reddened -- she had seen him only through the blur of her fears and tremors . Even after they had parted , and she was walking home with Anne , the shock of the encounter still tingling in her , he remained far off , almost imponderable , less close and importunate than her memories of him . It was as if his actual presence had exorcised his ghost . But now-- He had not vanished ; he had only been waiting . Waiting till she was alone in her room in the sleeping house , in the unheeding city . How alone , she had never more acutely felt . Who on earth was there to intervene between them , when there was not a soul to whom she could even breathe that she had met him ? She lay in the darkness with terrified staring eyes , and there he stood , his smile deriding her -- a strange composite figure , made equally of the old Chris and the new .... It was of no use to shut her eyes ; he was between lid and ball . It was of no use to murmur disjointed phrases to herself , conjure him away with the language of her new life , with allusions and incantations unknown to him ; he just stood there and waited . Well , then -- she would face it out now , would deal with him ! But how ? What was he to her , and what did he want of her ? Yes : it all came to the question of what he wanted ; it always had . When had there ever been a question of what _ she _ wanted ? He took what he chose from life , gathered and let drop and went on : it was the artist ’s way , he told her . But what could he possibly want of her now , and why did she imagine that he wanted anything , when by his own showing he was so busy and so provided for ? She pulled herself together , suddenly ashamed of her own thoughts . In pity for herself she would have liked to draw the old tattered glamour over him ; but there must always have been rents and cracks in it , and now it could n’t by any tugging be made to cover him . No ; she did n’t love him any longer ; she was sure of that . Like a traveller who has just skirted an abyss , she could lean over without dizziness and measure the depth into which she had not fallen . But if that were so , why was she so afraid of him ? If it were a mere question of her own social safety , a mean dread of having her past suspected , why , she was more ashamed of that than of having loved him . She would almost rather have endured the misery of still loving him than of seeing what he and she looked like , now that the tide had ebbed from them . She had been a coward ; she had been stiff and frightened and conventional , when , from the vantage - ground of her new security , she could so easily have been friendly and generous ; she felt like rushing out into the streets to find him , to speak to him as she ought to have spoken , to tell him that she was not in the least afraid of him . And yet she _ was _ ! She supposed it was the old incalculable element in him , that profound fundamental difference in their natures which used to make their closest nearness seem more like a spell than a reality . She understood now that if she had always been afraid of him it was just because she could never tell what she was afraid of .... If only there had been some one to whom she could confess herself , some one who would laugh away her terrors ! Fred Landers ? But she would frighten him more than he reassured her . And the others -- the kindly approving family ? What would they do but avert their eyes and beg her to be reasonable and remember her daughter ? Well -- and her daughter , then ? And Anne ? Was there any one on earth but Anne who would understand her ? The oppression of the night and the silence , and the rumour of her own fears , were becoming intolerable . She could not endure them any longer . She jumped up , flung on her dressing - gown , and stole out of her room . The corridor was empty and obscure ; only a faint light from the lower hall cast its reflection upward on the ceiling of the stairs . From below came the pompous tick of the hall clock , as loud as a knocking in the silence . She stole to her daughter ’s door , and kneeling down laid her ear against the crack . Presently , through the hush , she caught the soft rhythmic breath of youthful sleep , and pictured Anne , slim and motionless , her dark hair in orderly braids along the pillow . The vision startled the mother back to sanity . She got up stiffly and stood looking about her with dazed eyes . Suddenly the light on the stairs , the nocturnal ticking , swept another vision through her throbbing brain . In just such a silence , before the first cold sounds of the winter daylight , she had crept down those very stairs , unchained the front door , slipped back one after another of John Clephane ’s patent bolts , and let herself out of his house for the last time . Ah , what business had she in it now , her hand on her daughter ’s door ? She dragged herself back to her own room , switched on the light , and sat hunched up in the great bed , mechanically turning over the pages of a fashion - paper she had picked up on her sitting - room table . Skirts were certainly going to be narrower that spring .... IX . “
32409	32967	32404	32404	he	820	” she exclaimed . She raised herself on her elbow , saw the bed - lamp still burning , and the fashion - paper on the floor beside the bed . The night was not over ; there was no grayness yet between the curtains . She must have dropped into a short uneasy sleep , from which Lilla ’s loitering expectant figure , floating away from her down an alley of the Park , had detached itself with such emphasis that the shock awoke her . Lilla and Chris ... but of course they had gone to the Park to meet each other ! Why should he have happened to turn in at that particular gate , at that particular hour , unless to find some one who , a few yards off , careless and unconcerned , was so obviously lingering there to be found ? The discovery gave Kate Clephane a sensation of actual physical nausea . She sat up in bed , pushed her hair back from her damp forehead , and repeated the two names slowly , as if trying from those conjoined syllables to disentangle the clue to the mystery . For mystery there was ; she was sure of it now ! People like Lilla Gates and Chris did not wander aimlessly through Central Park at the secret hour when the winter dusk begins to blur its paths . Every moment of such purposeless lives was portioned out , packed with futilities . Kate had seen enough of that in her enforced association with the idlers of a dozen watering - places , her dreary participation in their idling . And how the clue , now she held it , explained everything ! Explained , first of all , why Chris , the ready , the resourceful , had been so tongue - tied and halting when they met . Why had she not been struck by that before ? She saw now that , if she was afraid of him , he was a thousand times more afraid of her ! And how could she have imagined that , to a man like Chris , the mere fact of running across a discarded mistress would be disconcerting , or even wholly unpleasant ? Who better than he should know how to deal with such emergencies ? His past must be strewn with precedents . As her memory travelled back over their life together she recalled their having met , one day at Hadrian ’s Villa , a little woman , a Mrs. Guy So - and - so -- she had even forgotten the name ! She and Chris had been wandering , close - linked -- for the tourist season was over , and besides , they cared so little who saw them -- through the rich garlanded ruins , all perfume and enchantment ; and there , in their path , had stood a solitary figure , the figure of a young woman , pretty , well - dressed , with a hungry melancholy face . A little way behind her , a heavy elderly gentleman in blue goggles and an overcoat was having archæological explanations shouted into his deaf ear and curved hand by a guide with a rasping German accent -- and Chris , exclaiming : “
32980	33052	32973	32978	the So - and - sos	821	” had advanced with outstretched hand , introduced the two women , and poured out upon the melancholy newcomer a flood of laughing allusive talk , half chaff , half sentiment , and all as easily , as unconcernedly as if her great eyes had not , all the while , been pleading , pleading with him to remember . And then , afterward , when Kate had said to him : “
33079	33085	33057	33077	the woman you told me about once , who was so desperately unhappy , and wanted to run away with you	822	” he had merely answered : “
33100	33357	33057	33077	the woman you told me about once , who was so desperately unhappy , and wanted to run away with you	822	” and she had hugged his arm closer , and thought how funny he was , and luxuriously pitied the other woman . Yes ; that was the real Chris ; always on the spot , easy - going and gay . The stammering evasive apparition in the Park had no resemblance to that Chris ; Kate knew instinctively that it was not the fact of meeting her that had so disturbed him , but the fact that , for some reason , the meeting might interfere with his plans . But what plans ? Why , his plans with Lilla -- which would necessarily bring him in contact with the clan , since they so resolutely backed Lilla up , and thus expose him to -- to what ? To Kate ’s betraying him ? For a moment she half - laughed at the idea . For what could she do to injure him , after all ? And , whatever his plans were , how could he ever imagine her interfering with them , when to do so would be to betray her own secret ? She lay there in the dreary dawn and tried to work her way through the labyrinth . And then , all at once , it came to her : what if he wanted to marry Lilla ? And what more probable than that he did ? It was evident that living with his people and administering Mr. Maclew ’s philanthropies was not a life that he would have called “
33362	33425	33057	33077	the woman you told me about once , who was so desperately unhappy , and wanted to run away with you	822	” . He liked money , she knew , for all his careless way ; he wanted to have it , but he hated to earn it . And if he married Lilla there would be plenty of money . The Drovers would see to that -- Kate could imagine nothing more likely to unloose their purse - strings than the possibility of “
33427	33819	33057	33077	the woman you told me about once , who was so desperately unhappy , and wanted to run away with you	822	” Lilla , and getting rid of the perpetual menace that her roving fancies hung over her mother ’s neatly - waved head . Chris , of course , was far too clever not to have seen that , and worked out the consequences in his own mind . If Lilla had been plain and dowdy he would n’t even have considered it -- Kate did him that justice . If he liked money he liked it in a large lordly way , and only as one among several things which it was convenient but not essential to have . He would never do a base thing for money ; but , after all , there was nothing base in marrying Lilla if he liked her looks and was amused by her talk , as he probably was . There was one side of Chris , the side Kate Clephane had least explored , and was least capable of understanding , which might very well find its complement in Lilla .... Kate ’s aching eyes continued to strain into the future . If that were really his plan , of course he would be afraid of her ! For he knew her too , knew her ever so much better than she did him , and would be sure to guess that , much as she would want to cover up their past , she would not hesitate a moment between revealing it and doing what she called her duty . Her duty -- how he used to laugh at the phrase ! He told her she had run away from her real duties only for the pleasure of inventing new ones , and that to her they were none the less duties because she imagined them to be defiances . It was one of the paradoxes that most amused him : the picture of her flying from her conscience and always meeting it again in her path , barely disguised by the audacities she had dressed it up in . Yes ; evidently he had asked himself , on the instant , what she would do about Lilla ; and the mere fact made her feel , with a fierce desperation , that she must do something . Not that she cared a straw about Lilla , or felt the least “
33821	34090	33057	33077	the woman you told me about once , who was so desperately unhappy , and wanted to run away with you	822	” to save her -- but to have Chris in the family , in the group , to have to smile at him across the Clephane dinner - table , the Drover dinner - table , all the family dinner - tables , to have to keep up , for all the rest of her life , the double pretence of never having liked him too much , and of now liking him enough to gratify the pride and allay the suspicions of the family -- no , she could not imagine herself doing it ! She was right to be afraid of him ; he was right to be afraid of her . * * * * * The return to daylight made her nocturnal logic seem absurd ; but several days passed before her agitation subsided . It was only when she found life continuing undisturbed about her , Anne painting for long rapturous hours , Lilla following her same bored round of pleasure , the others placidly engaged in their usual pursuits , and no one mentioning Chris ’s name , or apparently aware of his existence , that the shadow of her midnight imaginings was lifted . Once or twice , as the sense of security returned , she thought of letting Chris ’s name fall , ever so casually , in Fred Landers ’s hearing . She never got as far as that ; but one day she contrived , in speaking of some famous collection of books just coming into the market , to mention Horace Maclew . Landers ’s eye kindled . “
34107	34108	34109	34109	You	826	” “
34127	34134	34121	34121	you	826	” she stammered . He considered . “
34145	34154	34121	34121	you	826	” Her heart rose on the mounting hope . “
34172	34173	34167	34170	a very good librarian	828	” “
34206	34207	34199	34199	he	824	” “
34213	34220	34199	34199	he	824	” She heard her voice shake . “
34227	34234	34235	34235	I	0	” She thought he looked surprised . “
34297	34308	34294	34294	Maclew	181	” She drew her brows together , affecting to consider . “
34336	34337	34323	34323	One	247	” “
34418	34429	34431	34431	Anne	95	” Kate ’s heart gave a sharp downward plunge . That “
34432	34539	34431	34431	Anne	95	” reverberated in her like a knell . What a fool she had been to bring the subject up ! If she had not mentioned Horace Maclew ’s name Landers might never have thought of his library again ; at least not of the promise to take Anne there . Well , it was a lesson to hold her tongue , to let things follow their course without fearing or interfering . Happily Anne , more and more absorbed in her painting , seemed to have no idea of a visit to Washington ; she had never mentioned such a plan , beyond once casually saying : “
34556	35325	34548	34548	I	0	” Some spring ... well , that was pleasantly indefinite . For Chris was not likely to remain long with Horace Maclew . Where had Chris ever remained long ? Kate Clephane did not know , now , whether to tremble at that impermanence or be glad of it . She did not know what to think about anything , now that the thought of Chris had suddenly re - introduced itself into the smooth - running wheels of her existence . Then , as the days passed , her reassurance returned again , and it was with a stupefied start that one afternoon , crossing the Park on her way to the studio , she once more caught sight of Lilla Gates . This time the person for whom she had presumably been waiting was with her , and the two stood in close communion . The man ’s back was turned , but his figure , his attitude , were so familiar to Kate that she stopped short , trembling lest she should see his face . She did not see it . He and Mrs. Gates were in the act of leave - taking . Their hands met , they lingered for a last word , and then separated , each hastening away in a direction other than Kate ’s . She continued to stand motionless after they had vanished , uncertain yet certain . It was Chris -- but of course it was Chris ! He came often to New York , then , in spite of what he had said about the difficulty of getting away . If he had said that , it was probably just because he wanted to keep his comings and goings from Mrs. Clephane ’s knowledge . And that again would tally with what she suspected as to his motives . She turned sick , and stood with compressed lips and lowered head , as if to close her senses against what was coming . At length she roused herself and walked on . Lilla .... Lilla .... Chris and Lilla ! She kept on her way northward , following the less frequented by - ways of the Park . It was early yet , and she wanted to walk off her agitation before joining Anne at the studio . Lilla .... Lilla .... Chris and Lilla ! Something must be done about it , something must be said -- it was impossible that this affair , whatever it was , should go on unchecked . But had she , Kate Clephane , any power to prevent it ? Probably not -- her intervention might serve only to precipitate events . Well , at least she must know what was coming -- must find out what the others knew .... Her excitement increased instead of subsiding : as she walked on she felt the tears running down her face . Life had seemed , at last , so simple , so merciful , so soothing ; and here were all the old mysteries and duplicities pressing on her again . She stopped , out of breath , and finding herself at the extreme northern end of the Park , with the first street - lights beginning to gem the bare trees . The need to be with Anne suddenly seized her . Perhaps , by dropping a careless word or two , she might learn something from her daughter -- learn at least if the baleful Lilla were using the girl as a confidant , as that brief scene in the studio had once suggested . On that point , at any rate , it was the mother ’s right , her duty even , to be informed . She had made no appointment to meet Anne that afternoon ; and she hastened her pace , fearing to find that her daughter had already left the studio .... A light through the transom reassured her . She put her key in the lock , threw off her cloak in the little entrance - hall , and pushed open the door beyond . The studio was unlit except by the city ’s constellated lamps , hung like a golden vintage from an invisible trellising of towers and poles , and by the rosy gleam of the hearth . Anne ’s easel had been pushed aside , and Anne and another person were sitting near each other in low chairs , duskily outlined against the fire . As Mrs. Clephane crossed the threshold a man ’s voice was saying gaily : “
35388	35502	35503	35503	Mother	185	” Kate Clephane stood still , enveloped by the voice . It was the first time she had heard those laughing confiding inflexions addressed to any ear but hers . Southern sunshine scorched her ; the air seemed full of flowers . She hung there for a moment , netted in tightening memories ; then she loosed her hold on the door - handle and advanced a few steps into the room . Her heels clicked on the bare floor , and the two by the fire rose and turned to her . She fancied her daughter ’s glance conveyed a faint surprise -- was it even a faint annoyance at her intrusion ? “
35516	35551	35512	35512	you	185	” the girl said . Chris came forward , simple , natural , unembarrassed . There was no trace of constraint in his glance or tone ; he looked at Mrs. Clephane almost fraternally . “
35563	35603	35552	35554	Dear Mrs. Clephane	187	” he entreated , with that half - humorous way he had of flinging the lasso of his own thought over anybody who happened to stray within range ; and then , with one of his usual quick transitions : “
35656	35657	35646	35647	Miss Clephane	95	” “
35666	35734	35658	35658	I	0	” the girl added , looking gravely at her mother . In spite of the blood drumming in her head , and the way his airy fib about having heard she was in town had drawn her again into the old net of their complicities , Kate was steadied by his composure . She looked from him to Anne ; and Anne ’s face was also composed . “
35740	35744	35747	35748	Miss Clephane	95	” Chris added , “
35798	35799	35791	35791	I	0	” “
35804	35814	35791	35791	I	0	” said the girl , with her quiet smile , “
35823	35824	35791	35791	I	0	” “
35828	35835	35791	35791	I	0	” he had one of his easy gestures--“lameness
35856	35919	35920	35920	Jove	184	” Silence fell . Kate struggled to break it , feeling that she was expected to speak , to say something , anything ; but there was an obstruction in her throat , as if her voice were a ghost vainly struggling to raise its own grave - stone . Their visitor made the automatic motion of consulting his wrist - watch . “
35943	35964	35922	35922	I	0	” He stood looking in his easy way from mother to daughter ; then he turned once more to Kate . “
35987	35988	35985	35986	Miss Clephane--	189	” “
35998	36004	35989	35990	Uncle Fred	94	” the girl threw in . “
36018	36027	36015	36016	Mrs. Clephane	187	” This time he wavered a second before the “
36029	36038	36015	36016	Mrs. Clephane	187	” , and then carried it off triumphantly . “
36055	36087	36049	36049	you	187	” He was holding out his hand . Kate put hers in it ; she did not mind . It was as if she had laid a stone in his palm . “
36095	36114	36115	36116	Major Fenno”--	190	” he repeated gaily , as he shook hands with Anne ; and the door closed on him . “
36116	36140	36115	36116	Major Fenno”--	190	Fenno”-- . Kate repeated the name slowly as she turned back toward the fire . She had never heard of his military rank . “
36145	36152	36115	36116	Major Fenno”--	190	” she asked her daughter suddenly . “
36182	36191	36193	36193	he	857	” Anne ’s voice had an unwonted vibration . “
36208	36286	36201	36201	he	857	” she added . She was gathering up her brushes , rubbing her pallet with a rag , going through all the habitual last gestures with her usual somewhat pedantic precision . She found something wrong with one of the brushes , and bent over the lamp with it , her black brows jutting . At that moment she reminded her mother of old Mrs. Clephane ; somehow , there was an odd solace in the likeness . “
36297	36516	36295	36295	Lilla	153	” the mother thought , as her eyes rested on her daughter ’s stern young profile ; and again she felt the necessity of clearing up the mystery . On the whole , it might be easier to question Anne , now that the name had been pronounced between them . Major Fenno -- and he had been wounded .... And all he cared about was his writing . X. After all , she was not going to be able to question Anne about Lilla . As she faced the situation the next day -- as she faced the new Chris in her path -- Kate Clephane saw the impossibility of using him as a key to her daughter ’s confidence . There was one thing much closer to her now than any conceivable act of Chris ’s could ever be ; and that was her own relation to Anne . She simply could not talk to Anne about Chris -- not yet . It was not that she regarded that episode in her life as a thing to be in itself ashamed of . She was not going , even now , to deny or disown it ; she wanted only to deny and disown Chris . Quite conceivably , she might have said to her daughter : “
36533	36563	36564	36564	I	0	” But to say it about Chris ! To see the slow look of wonder in those inscrutable depths of Anne ’s eyes : a look that said , not “
36567	36571	36572	36572	I	0	” , or even “
36575	36586	36587	36587	You	861	” , but , so much more scathingly , just : “
36596	36628	36587	36587	You	861	” Yes ; that was it . It was necessary for her pride and dignity , for her moral safety almost , that what people like Enid Drover would have called her “
36630	36869	36870	36870	Thy	864	” should remain unidentified , unembodied -- or at least not embodied in Chris Fenno . Yet to know -- to know ! There were , of course , other sources of enlightenment ; if there were anything in her theory of a love - affair between Lilla and Chris , the family were probably not unaware of it . Kate had the sense that they never had their eyes off Lilla for long . But it was all very well to plan to talk to them -- the question remained , how to begin ? Before trying to find out about Lilla she would first have to find out about them . What did she know of any one of them ? Nothing more , she now understood , than their glazed and impenetrable surfaces . She was still a guest among them ; she was a guest even in her daughter ’s house . It was the character she had herself chosen ; in her dread of seeming to assert rights she had forfeited , to thrust herself into a place she had deserted , she had perhaps erred in the other sense , held back too much , been too readily content with the easy part of the week - end visitor . Well -- it had all grown out of the other choice she had made when , years ago , she had said : “
36880	37061	37062	37062	Mother	185	” And now she but dimly guessed who their gods were . At the moment when her very life depended on her knowing their passwords , holding the clue to their labyrinth , she stood outside the mysterious circle and vainly groped for a way in . Nollie Tresselton , of course , could have put the clue in her hand ; but to speak to Nollie was too nearly like speaking to Anne . Not that Nollie would betray a confidence ; but to be divined and judged by her would be almost as searing an experience as being divined and judged by Anne . And so Kate Clephane continued to sit there between them , hugging her new self in her anxious arms , turning its smooth face toward them , and furtively regulating its non - committal gestures and the sounds that issued from its lips . Only the long nights of dreamless sleep were gone ; and her heart stood still each time she slipped the key into the studio door . * * * * * “
37086	37154	37064	37065	Uncle Fred	94	” Anne threw it over her shoulder as she stood before her easel , frowning and narrowing her lips at the difficulty of a branch of red pyrus japonica in a brass pot , haloed with the light of the sunlit window . Kate , behind her , was leaning back indolently in a deep wicker armchair . She started , and echoed in a blank voice : “
37158	37159	37064	37065	Uncle Fred	94	” “
37224	37263	37213	37214	Uncle Fred	94	” It sounded perfectly simple and sensible ; Anne spoke of it in her usual matter - of - course tone . Her mother tried for the same intonation in answering , with a faint touch of surprise : “
37267	37275	37264	37264	Lilla	153	” Anne turned around completely and smiled . “
37310	37450	37306	37306	Lilla	153	” Kate ’s heart gave a great bound of relief or resentment -- which ? Why , relief , she instantly assured herself . She had been right then -- that was the key to the mystery ! And why not ? After all , what did it matter to her ? Had she , Kate , ever imagined that Chris ’s love - affairs would cease when she passed from his life ? Was n’t it most probably in pursuit of a new one that he had left her ? To think so had been , at any rate , in spite of the torturing images evoked , more bearable than believing he had gone because he was tired of her . For years , as she now saw , she had been sustained by her belief in that “
37453	37511	37666	37666	I	0	” ; only , that she should take shape in Lilla was unbelievably humiliating . Anne continued to smile softly down on her mother . In her smile there was something veiled and tender , as faint as sunlight refracted from water -- a radiance striking up from those mysterious depths that Kate had never yet reached . “
37522	37533	37535	37535	she	873	” the girl continued ; and Kate said to herself : “
37551	37583	37541	37541	she	873	” She remembered the cryptic allusion of the football - faced youth at the Opera , and the way those vigilant lids of Anne ’s had shut down on her vision . “
37590	37654	37588	37588	Lilla	153	” Mrs. Clephane absently assented . Inwardly she was saying to herself that it would be impossible for her to go to Baltimore on that particular errand . Chris and Lilla -- Chris and Lilla ! The coupled names began again to jangle maddeningly through her brain . She stood up and moved away to the window . No , she could n’t ! “
37676	37699	37666	37666	I	0	” She spoke from the window , without turning her head toward her daughter , who had gone back to the easel . “
37702	37712	37666	37666	I	0	” There was distinct disappointment in Anne ’s voice . “
37751	37757	37739	37739	People	256	” Kate stammered , while the “
37763	37771	37739	37739	People	256	” kept booming on in her ears . “
37774	37778	37739	37739	People	256	” she added , “
37796	37800	37793	37794	Mr. Maclew	182	” Anne laughed . “
37814	37827	37807	37807	he	182	” she said with a gay significance ; but added at once : “
37850	37851	37852	37852	Our	878	” “
37855	37856	37852	37852	Our	878	” “
37868	37880	37881	37881	We	878	” Mrs. Clephane sprang up impulsively and moved toward her daughter . “
37893	37933	37891	37891	Anne	95	” Anne ’s lips dropped ; she nodded , screwed her mouth up , and opened her other eyes -- her painter ’s eyes -- on the branch of pyrus with its coral - like studding of red cups . “
37939	38265	37891	37891	Anne	95	” she agreed . * * * * * The young party went , Fred Landers beaming in attendance . The family thought it a pity that Mrs. Clephane should miss such a chance , for Horace Maclew was chary of exhibiting his books . But there was something absent - minded and perfunctory in the tone of these regrets ; Kate could see that the family interest was passionately centred in Lilla . And she felt , more and more , that in the circumstances she herself was better out of the way . For , at the last moment , the party had been invited to stay at Horace Maclew ’s ; and to have assisted , in an almost official capacity , at the betrothal of Chris and Lilla , with all the solemnity and champagne likely to ensue in such a setting , was more than her newly healed nerves could have endured . It was easier to sit at home and wait , and try to prepare herself for this new and unbelievable situation . Chris and Lilla-- ! It was on the third day that Aline , bringing in the breakfast - tray with a bunch of violets ( Anne ’s daily attention since she had been gone ) , produced also a telegram ; as on that far - off morning , four months ago , when the girl ’s first message had come to her mother with the same flowers . Kate held the envelope for a moment before opening it , as she had done on that other occasion -- but not because she wanted to prolong her illusion . This time there was no illusion in the thin envelope between her fingers ; she could feel through it the hard knife - edge of reality . If she delayed she did so from cowardice . Chris and Lilla-- She tore open the envelope and read : “
38274	38298	38272	38272	Lilla	153	” The telegram fluttered to the floor , and Kate Clephane leaned back on her pillows , feeling a little light - headed . “
38304	38309	38300	38300	Madame	130	” Aline sharply questioned . “
38320	38648	38649	38649	I	0	” Kate repeated joyously . But she continued to lean back , staring vacantly ahead of her , till Aline admonished her , as she had done when the other message came , that the chocolate would be getting cold . A respite -- a respite . Oh , yes , it was at least a respite ! XI . There was something so established and reassuring in the mere look of Enid Drover ’s drawing - room that Kate Clephane , waiting there that afternoon for her sister - in - law to come in , felt a distinct renewal of confidence . The house was old Mrs. Clephane ’s wedding gift to her daughter , and everything in it had obviously been selected by some one whose first thought concerning any work of art was to ask if it would chip or fade . Nothing in the solid and costly drawing - room had chipped or faded ; it had retained something of Enid ’s invulnerable youthfulness , and , like herself , had looked as primly old - fashioned in its first bloom as in its well - kept maturity . It was odd that so stable a setting should have produced that hurricane of a Lilla ; and Kate smiled at the thought of the satisfaction with which the very armchairs , in their cushioned permanence , would welcome her back to domesticity . But Mrs. Drover , when she appeared , took it on a higher plane . Had Lilla ever been unstable , or in any way failed to excel ? If so , her mother , and her mother ’s background , showed no signs of remembering . The armchairs stood there stolidly , as if asking what you meant by such ideas . Enid was a little troubled -- she confessed -- by the fact that Horace Maclew was a widower , and so much older than her child . “
38692	38710	38722	38722	him	182	” Opportunities for doing good ! It was on the tip of Kate ’s tongue to say : “
38724	38733	38717	38717	Lilla	153	” ; but Mrs. Drover was serenely continuing : “
38753	38777	38743	38743	She	153	” And Kate understood that , for the present , the opportunities for doing good lay rather with the bridegroom than the bride . “
38781	38787	38743	38743	She	153	” Mrs. Drover went on , “
38872	38936	38940	38942	Mrs. Minity speaking	100	” The phrase gave Kate ’s nerves a sudden twist . It was just what Chris used to say when she urged him to settle down to his painting -- at least on the days when he did n’t say that excitement was necessary to the artist .... She looked at her sister - in - law ’s impenetrable pinkness , and thought : “
38944	39021	38940	38942	Mrs. Minity speaking	100	” Fred Landers had telephoned that he had got back and was coming to dine ; she fancied he had it on his mind not to let her feel her solitude while Anne was away ; and she said to herself that from him at least she would get a glimpse of the truth . Fred Landers , as became a friend of the family , was also beaming ; but he called Lilla ’s engagement a “
39023	39027	38940	38942	Mrs. Minity speaking	100	” and not a “
39029	39045	38940	38942	Mrs. Minity speaking	100	” ; and this made it easier for Kate at last to put her question : “
39051	39086	38940	38942	Mrs. Minity speaking	100	” He leaned back , pulling placidly at his after - dinner cigar , his old - fashioned square - toed pumps comfortably stretched to the fire ; and for an instant Kate thought : “
39100	39114	38940	38942	Mrs. Minity speaking	100	” It was the first time such a possibility had occurred to her . “
39125	39138	39117	39117	she	885	” He screwed up his friendly blue eyes in a confidential grin . “
39224	39225	39229	39229	you	886	” “
39234	39238	39229	39229	you	886	” He shrugged . “
39289	39302	39281	39281	We	889	” Kate sat pondering her next question . At length she said : “
39311	39312	39304	39305	Mr. Maclew	182	” “
39324	39332	39319	39319	he	892	” She fancied he frowned a little . “
39343	39359	39335	39335	you	886	” He turned toward her , and she saw that his friendly brows were beetling . “
39383	39384	39378	39378	him	892	” “
39392	39427	39385	39385	You	886	” She felt the blood creeping to her forehead , and reached out for a painted hand - screen that she might seem to hold between her eyes and the fire . Landers reflected . “
39465	39466	39444	39444	he	892	” “
39471	39488	39444	39444	he	892	” said Kate suddenly . Landers smiled a little , though his brows continued to jut . “
39495	39496	39444	39444	he	892	” “
39500	39530	39497	39497	Anne--_Anne	194	” The name , after she had uttered it , continued to ring on between them , and she leaned back , pressing the screen against her closed lids . “
39533	39539	39497	39497	Anne--_Anne	194	” she managed to question . “
39566	39567	39556	39556	I	0	” “
39583	39595	39580	39580	I	0	” She hesitated , and then went on with a rush : “
39610	39624	39625	39625	Fenno	88	” Landers sat up and flung his cigar - end into the embers . “
39643	39644	39647	39647	I	0	” “
39665	39697	39647	39647	I	0	” She hurried it out with a kind of violence . Her heart was beating to suffocation ; she had to utter her suspicion , to give it life and substance . “
39743	39753	39754	39754	I	0	” Landers added with a sudden sigh of relief , “
39767	39768	39765	39765	anybody	1494	” “
39777	39950	39775	39775	Lilla	153	” Kate spoke with a passionate emphasis . She had to prove to some one that Chris was Lilla ’s lover in order to believe it herself , and she had to believe it herself in order to dispel the dreadful supposition raised by Landers ’s words . She found herself , now , able to smile away his suggestion quite easily , to understand that he had meant it only as a random joke . People in America were always making jokes of that kind , juvenile jokes about flirtations and engagements ; they were the staple topic of the comic papers . But the shock of finding herself for a second over that abyss sent her stumbling back half - dazed to the safe footing of reality . If she were going to let her imagination run away at any chance word , what peace would there ever be for her ? The next day Nollie Tresselton reappeared , smiling and fresh , like a sick - nurse whose patient has “
39954	39986	39775	39775	Lilla	153	” . With Lilla off her hands her keen boyish face had lost its expression of premature vigilance , and she looked positively rejuvenated . She was more outspoken than Landers . “
39998	40166	39775	39775	Lilla	153	” And she began . Horace Maclew and Lilla had met the previous autumn , duck - shooting in South Carolina . Lilla was a wonderful shot when she was n’t ... well , when she was in training ... and Maclew , like most heavy solemn men of his type , who theoretically admire helpless feminine women , had been bowled over by the sight of this bold huntress , who damned up and down the birds she missed , smoked and drank with the men , and in the evening lay back silent , with lids half - dropped over smouldering sullen eyes , and did n’t bore one with sporting chatter or sentimental airs . It had been a revelation , the traditional thunderbolt ; only , once back in Baltimore , Maclew had been caught in the usual network of habits and associations ; or perhaps other influences had intervened . No doubt , with a man like that , there would be a “
40169	40265	40267	40268	no one	750	” in the background . Then Lilla , for a while , was more outrageous than ever , and when he came to New York to see her , dragged him to one of her rowdiest parties , and went away from it in the small hours with another man , leaving Maclew and his super - Rolls to find their way home uncompanioned . After that the suitor had vanished , and it had taken the combined efforts of all the family , and the family ’s friends , to draw him back . ( “
40276	40337	40338	40338	He	901	” Nollie added with a grateful sigh . ) The name , dropping suddenly into their talk , made Lilla and her wooer and all the other figures in the tale shrivel up like toy balloons . Kate Clephane felt her blood rising again ; would she never be able to hear Chris mentioned without this rush of the pulses ? “
40347	40353	40338	40338	He	901	” Nollie was going on . “
40422	40423	40410	40410	he	901	” “
40431	40469	40427	40427	Lilla	153	” The words had flashed out before Kate even knew the thought had formed itself . It must have welled up from some depth of bitterness she had long thought dry . Nollie ’s eyes looked grieved . “
40478	40479	40472	40472	you	0	” “
40488	40493	40480	40480	I	0	” Kate answered lifelessly . “
40572	40616	40568	40568	he	901	” Look up to her when he was a boy ! Yes ; that ’s how he _ would _ put it . And the rest too ; how often she had heard that old analogy of the rolling stone and its victims ! “
40672	40677	40667	40667	I	0	” Nollie continued thoughtfully , “
40713	40714	40717	40717	he	901	” “
40723	40724	40717	40717	he	901	” “
40758	40759	40747	40747	He	901	” “
40767	40800	40747	40747	He	901	” Again the words had nearly slipped out . The effort to suppress them left Kate dumb for a moment , though she felt that Nollie was waiting for her to speak . “
40808	40817	40804	40804	he	901	” she assented . Inwardly she was thinking : “
40852	40905	40845	40845	him	901	” And her eyes suddenly filled with tears at the thought of his making a sacrifice , behaving at a crucial moment as her old ideal of him would have had him behave . After all , he was perhaps right in saying that the war had made a man of him . “
40933	40963	40923	40923	I	0	” Nollie went on . Ah , now , really they were too simple -- even Nollie was ! Kate could hardly keep from shouting it out at her : “
41011	41095	40998	40998	Maclew	181	” But something in her -- was it pride or prudence?--recoiled from such an outburst , and from the need of justifying it . In God ’s name , what did it matter to her -- what did it matter ? The risk was removed , the dreadful risk ; she was safe again -- as safe as she would ever be -- unless some suicidal madness drove her to self - betrayal . With dry lips and an aching smile she said : “
41109	41174	41096	41096	You	914	” XII . Anne ’s sojourn in Washington prolonged itself for a fortnight . Her letters to her mother , though punctual , were inexpressive ; but that was not her fault , Kate knew . She had inherited from her father a certain heaviness of pen , an inability to convey on paper shades of meaning or of feeling , and having said : “
41182	41279	41096	41096	You	914	” had evidently exhausted the subject , or rather her power of developing it . At length she returned , bringing with her some studies of magnolias that were freer and more vigorous than any of her previous work . She greeted her mother with her usual tenderness , and to Kate her coming was like a lifting of clouds and opening of windows ; the mother had never supposed that anything in her life could ever again strike such deep roots as this passion for her daughter . _ Perfect love casteth out fear ! _ “
41291	41446	41096	41096	You	914	” she had often incredulously asked herself . But now , for the first time , love and security dwelt together in her in a kind of millennial quiet . She grudged having to dine out on the evening of Anne ’s return ; but Mrs. Porter Lanfrey was celebrating Lilla ’s betrothal by a big dinner , with music afterward , and Anne , arriving by a late train , had barely time to dress before the motor was announced . There was no way of avoiding the festivity ; its social significance was immeasurable . Mrs. Lanfrey was one of the hostesses who had dropped Lilla from their lists after the divorce , and Mrs. Lanfrey ’s yea or nay was almost the last survival of the old social code in New York . Those she invited , at any rate , said that hers was the only house where there was a “
41448	41462	41096	41096	You	914	” left ; and though Lilla , at this , used to growl : “
41473	41521	41096	41096	You	914	” her reinstatement visibly elated her as much as it did her family . To Enid Drover -- resplendent in all her jewels -- the event had already reversed the parts in her daughter ’s matrimonial drama , and relegated all the obloquy to the outraged Gates . “
41536	41568	41571	41571	she	917	” Enid whispered to Mrs. Clephane as the sisters - in - law took off their cloaks in the marble hall ; and Kate inwardly emended , with a faint smile : “
41578	41709	41571	41571	she	917	” Mrs. Clephane had entered the vast Lanfrey drawing - room with a shrinking not produced by the presence of most of her own former censors and judges -- now transformed into staunch champions or carelessly benevolent acquaintances -- but by the dread of seeing , behind Mr. Maclew ’s momentous bulk , a slighter figure and more vivid face . But the moment of suspense was not long ; Chris was not there ; nor was his name announced after her arrival . The guests were all assembled ; the dining - room doors were thrown open , and Mrs. Lanfrey , taking Mr. Maclew ’s arm , majestically closed the procession from walnut - and - gold to gold - and - marble -- for the Lanfrey house was “
41711	41937	41096	41096	You	914	” made visible , and even the _ menu _ was exactly what a previous transmitter of the faith had thought a _ menu _ ought to be when Mrs. Lanfrey gave her first dinner . For a moment Kate Clephane felt herself in the faint bewildered world , between waking and sleeping . There they all were , the faces that had walled in her youth ; she was not sure , at first , if they belonged to the same persons , or had been handed on , as part of the tradition , to a new generation . It even occurred to her that , by the mere act of entering Mrs. Lanfrey ’s drawing - room , the latter ’s guests acquired a facial conformity that belonged to the Lanfrey plan as much as the fat prima - donna islanded in a sea of Aubusson who warbled an air from _ La Tosca _ exactly as a previous fat prima - donna had warbled it on the same spot years before . It seemed as if even Lilla , seated on a gilt sofa beside her betrothed , had smoothed her rebellious countenance to an official smirk . Only Anne and Nollie Tresselton resisted the enveloping conformity ; Kate wondered if she herself were not stealthily beginning to resemble Enid Drover . “
41946	41960	41941	41941	I	0	” she thought ; and found more reasons than ever for her flight . “
41970	42186	42187	42187	Dear	1521	” she murmured blissfully ... for that still justified the rest . Ah , how fate , in creating Anne , had baffled its own designs against Anne ’s mother ! * * * * * On the way home the girl was unusually silent . She leaned back against the cushions and let her lids drop . Was it because she was tired after her long day , or only because she was holding in her vision ? Kate could not tell . In the passing flashes of the arc - lights the head at her side , bound about with dark braids , looked as firm and young as a Greek marble ; Anne was still at the age when neither weariness nor anxiety mars the surface . Kate Clephane always respected her daughter ’s silences , and never felt herself excluded from them ; but she was glad when , as they neared their door , Anne ’s hand stole out to her . How many old breaches the touch healed ! It was almost as if the girl had guessed how often Kate had driven up to that door inertly huddled in her corner , with her husband ’s profile like a wall between her and the world beyond the windows . “
42198	42210	42189	42189	You	1521	” the mother said as they reached her sitting - room . “
42218	42234	42189	42189	You	1521	” Anne spoke from far off , as if she were groping through a dream . “
42256	42281	42251	42251	you’re	1521	” The girl opened her eyes wide , in the way she had when she came out of one of her fits of abstraction . “
42292	42298	42251	42251	you’re	1521	” She seemed to waver . “
42312	42313	42301	42301	I	0	” “
42319	42348	42301	42301	I	0	” Kate slipped an arm through hers , and they entered the shadowy welcoming room , lit by one veiled lamp and the faint red of the hearth . “
42366	42398	42301	42301	I	0	” the mother said , throwing herself back luxuriously on her lounge . It was delicious , after her fortnight of solitude , to think of talking things over with Anne . “
42406	42410	42413	42413	I	0	” she said . “
42417	42434	42413	42413	I	0	” Anne stood leaning against the chimney - piece , her head on her lifted arm . “
42474	42504	42505	42505	I	0	” She broke off , and crossing the hearth knelt down by her mother . Their hands met , and the girl leant her forehead against Kate ’s shoulder . “
42511	42569	42505	42505	I	0	” The confession sprang to Kate ’s lips . Oh , if at last she might say it ! But she dared not . The bond between her and her daughter was still too fragile ; and how would such an avowal sound on her lips ? It was better to let Anne guess-- Anne did guess . “
42582	42583	42584	42584	Happy	199	” “
42589	42590	42586	42587	Little Anne	95	” “
42648	42686	42637	42637	you	1521	” Kate lay still , letting the warmth of the words and the embrace flow through her . What praise had ever seemed as sweet ? All the past faded in the sunset radiance of the present . “
42690	42722	42687	42688	Little Anne	95	” she sighed again . The three syllables summed it all up . Anne was silent for a moment ; then she continued , her cheek still pressed against her mother : “
42743	42744	42734	42734	I	0	” “
42748	42778	42734	42734	I	0	” Kate sat up with a start . The girl ’s shoulder slipped from hers and they remained looking at each other , the space between them abruptly widened . “
42792	42904	42734	42734	I	0	” It was the first time such a question had arisen . On her arrival in America , when Landers , at Anne ’s request , had tentatively broached the matter of financial arrangements , Kate had cut him short with the declaration that she would gladly accept her daughter ’s hospitality , but preferred not to receive any money beyond the small allowance she had always had from the Clephane estate . After some argument Landers had understood the uselessness of insisting , and had doubtless made Anne understand it ; for the girl had never spoken of the subject to her mother . Kate put out an encircling arm . “
42927	42954	42734	42734	I	0	” For a moment Anne remained somewhat passively in her mother ’s embrace ; then she freed herself and went back to lean against the mantel . “
42967	42971	42962	42962	I	0	” she said . “
42986	43043	43044	43044	Dearest	716	” Her eyes still lingered smilingly on her mother . Kate sat upright again , and brushed back the lovely hair from her bewildered temples . What did Anne mean ? What was it she was trying to say ? The mother began to tremble with an undefined apprehension ; then the truth flashed over her . “
43053	43074	43046	43046	you	1521	” The girl nodded , with the quick drop of the lids that called up such memories to her mother . “
43107	43578	43104	43105	Major Fenno	186	” XIII . Baltimore -- the conductor called it out as the train ground its way into the station . Kate Clephane , on her feet in the long swaying Pullman , looked about her at the faces of all the people in the other seats -- the people _ who did n’t know _ . The whole world was divided , now , between people such as those , and the only two who did know : herself and one other . All lesser differences seemed to have been swallowed up in that .... She pushed her way between the seats , in the wake of the other travellers who were getting out -- she wondered why!--at Baltimore . No one noticed her ; she had no luggage ; in a moment or two she was out of the station . She stood there , staring in a dazed way at the meaningless traffic of the streets . Where were all these people going , what could they possibly want , or hope for , or strive for , in a world such as she now knew it to be ? There was a spring mildness in the air , and presently , walking on through the hurrying crowd , she found herself in a quiet park - like square , with budding trees , and bulbs pushing up in the mounded flower - beds . She sat down on a bench . Strength had been given her to get through that first hour with Anne ... she did n’t know how , but somehow , all at once , the shabby years of dissimulation , of manœuvring , of concealing , had leapt to her defence like a mercenary army roused in a righteous cause . She had to deceive Anne , to lull Anne ’s suspicions , though she were to die in the attempt . And she had not died-- That was the worst of it . She had never been more quiveringly , comprehensively alive than as she sat there , in that alien place , staring out alone into an alien future . She felt strong and light enough to jump up and walk for miles and miles -- if only she had known where to go ! They said grief was ageing -- well , this agony seemed to have plunged her into a very Fountain of Youth . No one could possibly know where she was . She had told her daughter that one of the aunts at Meridia was very ill ; dying , she believed she had said . To reach Meridia one passed through Baltimore -- it had all been simple enough . Luckily she had once or twice talked of the aunts to Anne ; had said vaguely : “
43594	44295	44297	44297	I	0	them”--so that now it seemed quite natural , and Anne , like all her generation , was too used to sudden comings and goings , and violent changes of plan , to do more than ring up the motor to take her mother to the first train , and recommend carrying a warm wrap . The hush , the solitude , the sense of being alone and unknown in a strange place to which no one knew she had gone , gradually steadied Kate Clephane ’s mind , and fragments torn from the last hours began to drift through it , one by one . Curiously enough , it was Anne ’s awkward little speech about giving her the house that came first -- perhaps because it might so easily be the key to the rest . Kate Clephane had never thought of money since she had been under her daughter ’s roof , save on the one occasion when she had refused to have her allowance increased . Her disregard of the matter came not so much from conventional scruples as from a natural gay improvidence . If one were poor , and lived from hand to mouth , one had to think about money -- worse luck ! But once relieved from the need of doing so , she had dismissed the whole matter from her thoughts . Safely sheltered , becomingly arrayed , she cared no more than a child for the abstract power of possession . And the possession of money , in particular , had always been so associated in her mind with moral and mental dependence that after her break with Hylton Davies poverty had seemed one of the chief attributes of freedom . It was Anne ’s suggestion of giving her the house which had flung a sudden revealing glare on the situation . Anne was rich , then -- very rich ! Such a house -- one of the few surviving from the time when Fifth Avenue had been New York ’s fashionable quarter -- must have grown greatly in value with the invasion of business . What could it be worth ? Mrs. Clephane could n’t conjecture ... could only feel that , to offer it in that way ( and with it , of course , the means of living in it ) , Anne , who had none of her mother ’s improvidence , must be securely and immensely wealthy . And if she were-- The mother stood up and stared about her . What she was now on the verge of thinking was worse , almost , than all the dreadful things she had thought before . If it were the money he wanted , she might conceivably buy him off -- that was what she was thinking ! And a nausea crept over her as she thought it ; for he had never seemed to care any more for money than she did . His gay scorn of it , not only expressed but acted upon , had been one of his chief charms to her , after all her years in the Clephane atmosphere of thrifty wealth , and the showy opulence of the months with Hylton Davies . Chris Fenno , quite simply and naturally , had laughed with her at the cares of the anxious rich , and rejoiced that those , at least , would never weigh on either of them . But that was long ago ; long at least in a life as full of chances and changes as his . Compared with the reckless boy she had known he struck her now as having something of the weight and prudence of middle - age . Might not his respect for money have increased with the increasing need of it ? At any rate , she had to think of him , to believe it of him , if she could , for the possibility held out her one hope in a welter of darkness . Her mind flagged . She averted her sickened eyes from the thought , and began to turn once more on the racking wheel of reiteration . “
44313	44951	44952	44953	Mr. Chris	202	” ... That was as far as she had got . She looked at her watch , and went up to a policeman to ask the way . * * * * * He was not to be found at Horace Maclew ’s , and to her surprise she learned that he did not live there . Careless as he had always been of money in itself , he was by no means averse to what it provided . No one was more appreciative of the amenities of living when they came his way without his having to take thought ; and she had pictured him quartered in a pleasant corner of Horace Maclew ’s house , and participating in all the luxuries of his larder and cellar . But no ; a super - butler , summoned at her request , informed her that Major Fenno had telephoned not to expect him that day , and that , as for his home address , the fact was he had never given it . A new emotion shot through her , half sharper anguish , half relief . If he were not lodged under the Maclew roof , if his private address were not to be obtained there , might it not be because he was involved in some new tie , perhaps actually living with some unavowable woman ? What a solution -- Kate Clephane leapt on it -- to be able to return to Anne with that announcement ! It seemed to clear the way in a flash -- but as a hurricane does , by ploughing its path through the ruins it makes . She supposed she would never , as long as she lived , be able to think evil of Chris without its hurting her . She turned away from the wrought - iron and plate - glass portals that were so exactly what she had known the Maclew portals would be . Perhaps she would find his address at a post - office . She asked the way to the nearest one , and vainly sought for his name in the telephone book . Well , it was not likely that he would proclaim his whereabouts if what she suspected were true . But as her eye travelled down the page she caught his father ’s name , and an address she remembered . Chris Fenno , though so habitually at odds with his parents , was fond of them in his easy way -- especially fond of his mother . Kate had often posted letters for him to that address . She might hear of him there -- if necessary she would ask for Mrs. Fenno . A trolley carried her to a Quakerish quarter of low plain - faced brick houses : streets and streets of them there seemed to be , all alike . Here and there a tree budded before one ; but the house at which she rang had an unbroken view of its dispirited duplicates . Kate Clephane was not surprised at the shabbiness of the neighbourhood . She knew that the Fennos , never well - off according to Clephane standards , had of late years been greatly straitened , partly , no doubt , through their son ’s own exigencies , and his cheerful inability to curtail them . Her heart contracted as she stood looking down at Mrs. Fenno ’s dingy door - mat -- the kind on which only tired feet seem to have wiped themselves -- and remembered her radiant idle months with Mrs. Fenno ’s son . She had to ring twice . Then the door was opened by an elderly negress with gray hair , who stood wiping her hands on a greasy apron , and repeating slowly : “
44955	44956	44952	44953	Mr. Chris	202	” “
44969	44974	44975	44976	Mr. Chris	202	” The woman stared . “
44988	45015	45016	45017	Major Fenno	186	” Kate returned the stare . Through the half - open door came the smell of chronic cooking ; a mournful waterproof hung against the wall . “
45021	45127	45016	45017	Major Fenno	186	” Major Fenno ; yes ; the woman repeated it . Mr. Chris they always called him , she added with a toothless smile . Of course he lived there ; she kinder thought he was upstairs now . His mother , she added gratuitously , had gone out -- stepped round to the market , she reckoned . She ’d go and look for Mr. Chris . Would the lady please walk in ? Kate was shown into a small dull sitting - room . All she remembered of it afterward was that there were funny tufted armchairs , blinds half down , a rosewood “
45132	45305	45016	45017	Major Fenno	186	” and other relics of vanished ease . Above the fireless chimney stood a too handsome photograph of Chris in uniform . After all , it was natural enough to find that he was living there . He had always hated any dependence on other people ’s plans and moods ; she remembered how irritably he had spoken of his servitude as Mr. Maclew ’s secretary , light as the yoke must be . And it was like him , since he was settled in Baltimore , to have returned to his parents . There was something in him -- on the side she had always groped for , and occasionally known in happy glimpses -- that would make him dislike to live in luxury in the same town in which his father and mother were struggling on the scant income his own follies had reduced them too . He would probably never relate cause and effect , or be much troubled if he did ; he would merely say to himself : “
45324	45343	45488	45488	you	941	people”--in the same tone in which he used to say to Kate , on their lazy Riviera Sundays : “
45369	45423	45424	45424	Kate	87	” And no doubt he did . He loved his parents tenderly whenever they were near enough to be loved . There was a step in the passage . She turned with a start and he came in . At sight of her he closed the door quickly . He was very pale . “
45426	45485	45424	45424	Kate	87	” he said , stopping on the threshold . She had been standing in the window , and she remained there , the width of the room between them . She was silenced by the curious deep shock of remembrance that his actual presence always gave her , and began to tremble lest it should weaken her resolve . “
45492	45508	45488	45488	you	941	” she finally said . He looked at her as if he hardly saw her . “
45516	45527	45513	45513	I	0	” he answered at length in a slow dragging voice . “
45542	45584	45585	45585	I	0	” As he stood there he seemed like some one snatched out of a trance . To her surprise she felt him singularly in her power . Their parts were reversed for the first time , and she said to herself : “
45596	45601	45594	45594	himself	942	” Aloud she asked : “
45609	45610	45604	45604	you	0	” “
45613	45637	45604	45604	you	0	” he began ; and then , suddenly , with a quick change of voice , and moving toward her with outstretched hands : “
45653	45870	45639	45639	God	195	” She knew every modulation ; he had pleaded with her so often before ! His trying it now only hardened her mind and cleared her faculties ; and with that flash of vision came the sense that she was actually seeing him for the first time . There he stood , stripped of her dreams , while she registered in a clear objective way all the strength and weakness , the flaws and graces of his person , marked the premature thinning of his smooth brown hair , the incipient crows’-feet about the lids , their too tender droop over eyes not tender enough , and that slight slackness of the mouth that had once seemed a half - persuasive pout , and was now only a sign of secret uncertainties and indulgences . She saw it all , and under the rich glaze of a greater prosperity , a harder maturity , a prompter self - assurance and resourcefulness , she reached to the central failure . That was what she became aware of -- and aware too that the awful fact of actually seeing another human being might happen to one for the first time only after years of intimacy . She averted her eyes as from a sight not meant for her . “
45876	45896	45639	45639	God	195	” she heard him repeat . She turned back to him and her answer caught up his unfinished phrase . “
45936	45937	45928	45928	you	943	” “
45942	45955	45928	45928	you	943	” He echoed the word in his flat sleep - walking voice . “
45963	45994	45960	45960	I	0	” The question completely hardened whatever his appearance , the startled beaten look of him , had begun to soften in her . She stood gazing at him and laughed . “
46014	46058	46011	46011	you	943	” As he stood before her she began to be aware that he had somehow achieved the attitude of dignity for which she was still struggling . He looked like an unhappy man , a cowed man ; but not a guilty one . “
46073	46077	46104	46104	you	943	” he began . “
46086	46087	46104	46104	you	943	” “
46107	46108	46104	46104	you	943	” “
46120	46121	46116	46116	I	0	” “
46130	46200	46201	46201	You	943	” They stood facing each other while she tried to gather up the shattered fragments of her authority . She had said to herself that what lay before her was horrible beyond human imagining ; but never once had she imagined that , if she had the strength to speak , he would have the strength to defy her . She opened her lips , but no sound came . “
46217	46221	46201	46201	You	943	” he continued . “
46253	46260	46245	46245	I	0	” She echoed the word blankly . “
46263	46269	46245	46245	I	0	” He smiled a little . “
46346	46494	46329	46329	You	943	” It was true . In that other life she had led she had never spoken to any one of Anne . She had never been able to . From the time when she had returned to Europe , frustrated in her final attempt to get the child back , or even to have one last glimpse of her , to the day when her daughter ’s cable had summoned her home , that daughter ’s name had never been uttered by her except in the depths of her heart . A darkness was about her feet ; her head swam . She looked around her vaguely , and put out her hand for something to lean on . Chris Fenno moved a chair forward , and she sat down on it without knowing what she was doing . He continued to stand in front of her . “
46500	46504	46495	46495	You	951	” he repeated . “
46513	46543	46511	46511	you	951	” She was beginning to feel , now , the relief of finding him less base than he had at first appeared . She lifted her eyes to his . “
46546	46547	46511	46511	you	951	” “
46551	46579	46581	46581	I	0	” He stopped , as if hoping she would help him to fill in the pause . But she made no sign , and he went on . “
46621	46622	46618	46618	I	0	” “
46628	46629	46631	46631	I	0	” “
46643	46644	46639	46639	I	0	” “
46647	46648	46631	46631	I	0	” “
46655	46656	46631	46631	I	0	” “
46672	46705	46668	46668	you	0	” She saw his lips hardening again to doggedness . He had dropped into a chair facing hers , and sat there with lowered head , his hands clenched on his knees . “
46716	46721	46722	46722	I	0	” She interrupted him . “
46742	46749	46707	46707	you	0	” He made a hopeless gesture . “
46755	46756	46707	46707	you	0	” “
46776	46788	46774	46774	you	0	” He stood up , and this time their eyes met . “
46809	46810	46814	46814	Your	0	” “
46818	46823	46814	46814	Your	0	” She laughed again . “
46841	46845	46832	46832	I	0	” she exclaimed . “
46863	46875	46856	46856	You	0	” He paused , and then added in a low voice : “
46885	46886	46892	46892	you	0	” “
46946	46975	46976	46976	You	0	” He stood before her , his eyes on the ground . At last he raised them again , but only for the length of a quick glance . “
46987	47001	46976	46976	You	0	” She sprang to her feet , strong now in her unmitigated scorn . “
47027	47028	47030	47030	I	0	” “
47064	47065	47059	47059	she	958	” “
47101	47173	47086	47086	I	0	” He made no answer , but turned and walked across the room and back . Then he sank into his chair , and renewed his study of the carpet . Finally he looked up again , with one of the tentative glances she knew so well : those glances that seemed to meet one ’s answer half - way in their desire to say what one would expect of him . “
47184	47248	47179	47179	your	0	” Again that appeal -- it was too preposterous ! But suddenly , her eyes on the huddled misery of his attitude , the weakness of his fallen features , she understood that the cry was real ; that he was in agony , and had turned to her for help . She crossed the room and laid her hand on his shoulder . “
47285	47306	47307	47307	I	0	” She felt her hand doubtfully taken and laid for a moment against his cheek . The cheek was wet . “
47311	47312	47307	47307	I	0	” “
47334	47343	47332	47332	I	0	” she exclaimed with a flash of inspiration , “
47410	47424	47398	47398	me	0	” He pressed the hand closer to his face and then dropped it . “
47470	47471	47487	47487	me	0	” “
47476	47480	47482	47482	me	0	” she panted , “
47491	47495	47489	47489	Chris	88	” she cried , “
47526	47550	47551	47551	You	0	” He looked up at her sharply , as if slow to grasp her words . Then his face hardened and grew red . “
47603	47604	47602	47602	you--	963	” “
47645	47850	47853	47854	my mother	966	” But she felt the speciousness of her words . How could one face the Gorgon - image of this difficulty as if it were like any other ? His silence seemed to echo her thought . Slowly he rose again from his chair , plunged his hands deeply into his pockets , with a gesture she remembered when he was troubled , and went and leaned in the jamb of the window . What was he thinking , she wondered , as he glanced vacantly up and down the long featureless street ? Smiling inwardly , perhaps , at the crudeness of her methods , the emptiness of her threats . For , after all -- putting the case at its basest -- if the money were really what had tempted him , how , with that fortune at his feet , could any offer of hers divert his purpose ? A clock she had not noticed began to tick insistently . It seemed to be measuring out the last seconds before some nightmare crash that she felt herself powerless to arrest . Powerless , at least-- She saw his expression change , and he turned and moved back quickly into the room . “
47873	47883	47860	47860	She	966	” He spoke with a faint smile of irony . “
47916	47924	47908	47908	She	966	” Kate had begun to tremble again . “
47949	47963	47943	47943	you	0	” she exclaimed . His face seemed to age as she watched it . “
47971	47975	47968	47968	I	0	” he acknowledged . “
48009	48045	48046	48046	You	0	” As he spoke , they heard , through the thin wall , the fumbling of a latch - key in the outer lock . Kate moved to the door ; her decision was taken . “
48100	48113	48094	48094	I	0	” Her hand was on the doorknob when he caught it back . “
48117	48159	48094	48094	I	0	” The street door opened and closed again , a dragging step passed through the narrow hall , and a door was opened into the region from which the negress with the greasy apron had emerged in a waft of cooking . “
48162	48174	48094	48094	I	0	” they heard Mrs. Fenno call in a tired elderly voice . “
48178	48210	48175	48175	I	0	” her son said , loosening his hold on Kate ’s wrist . The two continued to stand opposite each other with lowered heads . At length Mrs. Clephane moved away . “
48227	48231	48216	48216	You	0	” She paused . “
48282	48371	48280	48280	me	0	” He stood a few feet away from her , his eyes on the ground . Decidedly , she had beaten him , and he understood it . If there were any degrees left in such misery she supposed that the worst of it was over . XIV . As Kate Clephane drove up late that night to the house in Fifth Avenue she seemed to be reliving all her former anguished returns there , real or imaginary , from the days when she had said to herself : “
48377	48403	48280	48280	me	0	” to those others when , from far off , she had dreamed of the hated threshold , and yearned for it , and thought : “
48410	48719	48405	48405	I	0	” She had said she might be late in returning , and had begged that no one should stay up for her . Her wish , as usual , had been respected , and she let herself into the hushed house , put out the lights , and stole up past the door where Anne lay sleeping her last young sleep . Ah , that thought of Anne ’s awakening ! The thought of seeing Anne ’s face once again in all its radiant unawareness , and then assisting helpless at the darkening of its light ! How would the blow fall ? Suddenly and directly , or gradually , circuitously ? Would the girl learn her fate on the instant , or be obliged to piece it together , bit by bit , through all the slow agonies of conjecture ? What pretext would Chris give for the break ? He was skilled enough in evasions and subterfuges -- but what if he had decided to practise them on Anne ’s mother , and not on Anne ? What if the word he had given were already forfeited ? What assurance had any promise of his ever conveyed ? Kate Clephane sat in her midnight room alone with these questions . She had forgotten to go to bed , she had forgotten to undress . She sat there , in her travelling dress and hat , as she had stepped from the train : it was as if this house which people called her own were itself no more than the waiting - room of a railway station where she was listening for the coming of another train that was to carry her -- whither ? Ah , but she had forgotten -- forgotten that she had him in her power ! She had said to him : “
48732	48967	48720	48720	I	0	” and he had bowed his head to the warning and given his word . Why , the mere threat that she would tell his mother had thrown him on her mercy -- what would it be if she were to threaten to tell Anne ? She knew him ... under all his emancipated airs , his professed contempt for traditions and conformities , lurked an uneasy fear of being thought less than his own romantic image of himself .... No ; even if his designs on Anne were wholly interested , it would kill him to have her know . There was no danger there . The bitterness of death was passed ; yes -- but the bitterness of what came after ? What of the time to come , when mother and daughter were left facing each other like two ghosts in a gray world of disenchantment ? Well , the girl was young -- time would help -- they would travel .... Ah , no ; her tortured nerves cried out that there could not be , in any woman ’s life , another such hour as the one she had just lived through ! Toward dawn she roused herself , undressed , and crawled into bed ; and there she lay in the darkness , sharpening her aching wits for the continuation of the struggle . * * * * * “
48970	49076	49077	49077	I	0	” Aline always said it with the same slightly ironic intonation , as if it were still matter of wonder and amusement to her that any one should be in such haste to communicate with her mistress . Mrs. Clephane , in sables and pearls , with a great house at her orders , was evidently a more considerable person than the stray tenant of the little third - floor room at the Hôtel de Minorque , and no one was more competent to measure the distance between them than Aline . But still -- a telegram ! Kate opened the envelope with bloodless fingers . “
49081	49152	49077	49077	I	0	” That was all -- there was not even a signature . He had kept his word ; and he wanted her to know it . She felt the loosening of the cords about her heart ; a deep breath of relief welled up in her . He had kept his word . There was a tap on the door , and Anne , radiant , confident , came in . “
49163	49253	49161	49162	Aunt Janey--	977	” Aunt Janey ? For a second Kate could not remember , could not associate the question with anything related to the last hours . Then she collected herself , just in time to restrain a self - betraying clutch at the telegram . With a superhuman effort at composure she kept her hands from moving , and left the message lying , face up , on the coverlet between herself and Anne . Yet what if Anne were to read the _ Baltimore _ above the unsigned words ? “
49263	49272	49260	49261	Aunt Janey	205	” She made a farther effort at recollection . “
49348	49497	49498	49498	I	0	” Ah , now , at last she remembered , and how thankfully , that she had , after all , been to Meridia ; had , automatically , after leaving Chris , continued her journey , surprised and flattered the aunts by her unannounced appearance , and spent an hour with them before taking the train back to New York . She had had the wit , at the time , to see how useful such an alibi might be , and then , in the disorder of her dreadful vigil , had forgotten about it till Anne ’s question recalled her to herself . The complete gap in her memory frightened her , and made her feel more than ever unfitted to deal with what might still be coming -- what must be coming . Anne still shed about her the reflected radiance of her bliss . “
49528	49529	49518	49518	you	0	” “
49534	49535	49518	49518	you	0	” “
49539	49564	49518	49518	you	0	” The lids dropped , the lashes clasped her vision . How could her mother have forgotten?--that flutter of the lids seemed to say . “
49572	49625	49565	49565	Darling	206	” Kate Clephane brought the words out with dry lips . Her hand stole out to Anne ’s , then drew back , affecting to pick up the telegram . She could not put her hand in her daughter ’s just yet . The girl sat down beside her on the bed . “
49654	49772	49647	49647	He	982	” Ah , thank God for that ! The mother remembered now that Anne had told her this during their first talk -- the talk of which , at the time , no details had remained in her shattered mind . Now , as she listened , those details came back , bit by bit , phantasmagorically mingled . No one was to be told of the engagement ; no , not even Nollie Tresselton ; not till Chris came to New York . And that was not to be for another week . He could not get away sooner , and Anne had decreed that he must see her mother before their betrothal was made public . “
49793	49816	49785	49785	I	0	” the girl had said ; and Kate Clephane understood that it was out of regard for her , with the desire to “
49818	49875	49785	49785	I	0	” her again , and once for all , as the head of the house , that her daughter had insisted on this almost obsolete formality , had stipulated that her suitor should ask Mrs. Clephane ’s consent in the solemn old - fashioned way . The girl bent nearer , her radiance veiled in tenderness . “
49889	49895	49888	49888	him--	984	” ah , the familiar cruel words!--“You
49938	50005	50006	50006	Mother	1508	” Ah , God , how long would it go on ? Kate Clephane again reached out her hand , and this time clasped her daughter ’s with a silent nod of assent . Speech was impossible . She moistened her parched lips , but no sound came from them ; and suddenly she felt everything slipping away from her in a great gulf of oblivion . “
50017	50134	50012	50012	you’re	1508	” She was just aware , through the twilight of her faintness , that Anne ’s arm was under her , that Anne was ringing the bell and moistening her forehead . BOOK III . XV . Fantastic shapes of heavy leaf - shadows on blinding whiteness . Torrents of blue and lilac and crimson foaming over the branches of unknown trees . Azure distances , snow - peaks , silver reefs , and an unbroken glare of dead - white sunshine merging into a moonlight hardly whiter . Was there never any night , real , black , obliterating , in all these dazzling latitudes in which two desperate women had sought refuge ? They had “
50137	50222	50012	50012	you’re	1508	” It had been very interesting ; and Anne was better . Certainly she was much better . They were on their way home now , moving at a leisurely pace -- what was there to return for?--from one scene of gorgeous unreality to another . And all the while Anne had never spoken -- never really spoken ! She had simply , a day or two after Mrs. Clephane ’s furtive trip to Baltimore , told her mother that her engagement was broken : “
50226	50590	50591	50597	some one else ” whose coming mothers	2422	” were the stiff old - fashioned words she used . As no one else , even among their nearest , had been let into the secret of that fleeting bond , there was no one to whom explanations were due ; and the girl , her curt confidence to her mother once made , had withdrawn instantly into the rigid reserve she had maintained ever since . Just so , in former days , Kate Clephane had seen old Mrs. Clephane meet calamity . After her favourite daughter ’s death the old woman had never spoken her name . And thus with Anne ; her soul seemed to freeze about its secret . Even the physical resemblance to old Mrs. Clephane reappeared , and with it a certain asperity of speech , a sharp intolerance of trifles , breaking every now and again upon long intervals of smiling apathy . During their travels the girl was more than ever attentive to her mother ; but her solicitude seemed the result of a lesson in manners inculcated long ago ( with the rest of her creed ) by old Mrs. Clephane . It was impossible for a creature so young and eager to pass unseeingly through the scenes of their journey ; but it was clear that each momentary enthusiasm only deepened the inner pang . And from all participation in that hidden conflict between youth and suffering the mother continued to feel herself shut out . Nevertheless , she began to imagine that time was working its usual miracle . Anne ’s face was certainly less drawn -- Anne ’s manner perhaps a shade less guarded . Lately she had begun to sketch again ... she had suggested one day their crossing from Rio to Marseilles , continuing their wanderings in the Mediterranean ... had spoken of Egypt and Crete for the winter .... Mrs. Clephane acquiesced , bought guide - books , read up furtively , and tried to temper zeal with patience . It would not do to seem too eager ; she held her breath , waiting on her daughter ’s moods , and praying for the appearance of the “
50594	50802	50803	50803	Mother	185	” whose coming mothers invoke in such contingencies . That very afternoon , sitting on the hotel balcony above a sea of flowers , she had suffered herself to wonder if Anne , who was off on a long riding excursion with a party of young people , might not return with a different look , the clear happy look of the last year ’s Anne . The young English planter to whose _ hacienda _ they had gone had certainly interested her more than any one they had hitherto met . The mother , late that evening , was still alone on the balcony when , from behind her , Anne ’s shadow fell across the moonlight . The girl dropped into a seat . No , she was n’t tired -- wasn’t hungry -- they had supped , on the way back , at a glorious place high up over Rio . Yes , the day had been wonderful ; the beauty incredible ; and the moonlit descent through the forest .... Anne lapsed into silence , her profile turned from her mother . Perhaps -- who could tell ? Her silence seemed heavy with promise . Suddenly she put out a hand to Kate . “
50846	50857	50842	50842	I	0	” Her hand was trembling . Mrs. Clephane trembled too . “
50876	50877	50842	50842	I	0	” “
50882	50889	50842	50842	I	0	” The girl lowered her voice . “
50904	50913	50898	50898	he	989	” It broke from her in a sob . “
50926	50938	50920	50920	I	0	” She stretched her hand to the silver splendours beneath them . “
50957	51071	50920	50920	I	0	” Kate Clephane sat speechless . She remembered just such flashes of wild revolt in her own youth , when sea and earth and sky seemed joined in a vast conspiracy of beauty , and within her too all was darkness . For months she had been praying for this hour of recovered communion with her daughter ; yet now that it had come , now that the barriers were down , she felt powerless to face what was beyond . If it had been any other man ! Paralysed by the fact that it was just that one , she continued to sit silent , her hand on Anne ’s sunken head . “
51081	51091	51074	51074	you	991	” she whispered at last , to gain time . “
51128	51129	51117	51117	He	992	” “
51138	51139	51131	51131	he	992	” “
51191	51206	51167	51167	he	992	” The girl lifted her head , her agonized eyes on her mother ’s . “
51216	51229	51167	51167	he	992	” Kate Clephane had turned as cold as marble . At the word “
51231	51257	51165	51165	he	992	” she stood up , almost pushing the girl from her . In that searching moonlight , what might not Anne read in her eyes ? “
51263	51315	51165	51165	he	992	” she said . Anne followed her mechanically . In the high - ceilinged shadowy room Mrs. Clephane sat down in a wooden rocking - chair and the girl stood before her , tall and ghostly in her white linen riding - habit , the dark hair damp on her forehead . “
51324	51325	51322	51322	Anne	95	” “
51339	51340	51330	51330	you	95	” “
51384	51385	51347	51347	you	95	” “
51399	51458	51393	51393	You	95	” The mother locked her hands about the chair - arms . She sat looking down at the bare brick floor of the room , and at Anne ’s two feet , slim and imperious , planted just before her in an attitude of challenge , of resistance . She did not dare to raise her eyes higher . “
51467	51473	51460	51460	I	0	” she repeated to herself . “
51485	51537	51474	51474	Mother	185	” The girl ’s low - pitched voice had grown shrill ; her swaying tall white presence seemed to disengage some fiery fluid . Kate Clephane suddenly recalled the baby Anne ’s lightning - flashes of rage , and understood what reserves of violence still underlay her daughter ’s calm exterior . “
51566	51567	51551	51551	I	0	” “
51577	51593	51568	51568	You	185	” Kate Clephane drew a deep breath , and clasped the chair - arms tighter . “
51596	51597	51568	51568	You	185	” “
51606	51619	51620	51620	I	0	” Anne had once more sunk on her knees beside her mother . “
51637	51642	51628	51628	I	0	” she gasped out . “
51654	51664	51649	51649	I	0	” Kate put her arms about the shuddering body . “
51692	51693	51694	51694	You	185	” “
51697	51698	51694	51694	You	185	” “
51708	51709	51699	51699	He	1004	” “
51714	51715	51699	51699	He	1004	” “
51729	51730	51724	51724	I	0	” “
51733	51734	51724	51724	I	0	” “
51760	51761	51754	51754	I	0	” “
51793	51794	51782	51782	he	1004	” “
51814	51818	51782	51782	he	1004	” Kate winced . “
51826	51827	51782	51782	he	1004	” “
51885	51903	51906	51906	you	185	” Mrs. Clephane again sat silent , with lowered head . She had not foreseen this torture . “
51933	51947	51948	51948	You	185	” The girl shook herself free and stood up with a tragic laugh . “
51957	51979	51948	51948	You	185	” That word was crueller than the other ; the mother shrank from it as if she had received a blow . “
52008	52009	52010	52010	My	0	” “
52040	52072	52073	52073	I	0	” Kate Clephane rose to her feet also . Her own pride seemed suddenly to start up from its long lethargy , and she looked almost defiantly at her defiant daughter . “
52081	52082	52073	52073	I	0	” “
52087	52088	52089	52089	I	0	” “
52093	52094	52089	52089	I	0	” “
52111	52126	52105	52105	You	185	” The girl was close to her , in a white glare of passion . “
52153	52161	52162	52162	I	0	” Kate Clephane ’s first thought was : “
52171	52263	52162	52162	I	0	” not because of the fear of increasing her daughter ’s suffering , but to prevent her finding out how she could inflict more pain . Anne , at that moment , looked as if the discovery would have been exquisite to her . The mother dared not speak ; she feared her whole agony would break from her with her first word . The two stood facing each other for a moment ; then Mrs. Clephane put her hand out blindly . But the girl turned from it with a fierce “
52267	52547	52162	52162	I	0	” that seemed to thrust her mother still farther from her , and swept out of the room without a look . XVI . Anne had decreed that they should return home ; and they returned . The day after the scene at Rio the girl had faltered out an apology , and the mother had received it with a silent kiss . After that neither had alluded to the subject of their midnight talk . Anne was as solicitous as ever for her mother ’s comfort and enjoyment , but the daughter had vanished in the travelling companion . Sometimes , during those last weary weeks of travel , Kate Clephane wondered if any closer relation would ever be possible between them . But it was not often that she dared to look ahead . She felt like a traveller crawling along a narrow ledge above a precipice ; a glance forward or down might plunge her into the depths . As they drew near New York she recalled her other return there , less than a year before , and the reckless confidence with which she had entered on her new life . She recalled her first meeting with her daughter , her sense of an instant understanding on the part of each , and the way her own past had fallen from her at the girl ’s embrace . Now Anne seemed remoter than ever , and it was the mother ’s past which had divided them . She shuddered at the fatuity with which she had listened to Enid Drover and Fred Landers when they assured her that she had won her daughter ’s heart . “
52556	52819	52820	52820	She	1020	” Was it possible that that absurd phrase had ever satisfied her ? But daughters , she said to herself , do n’t take a fancy to their mothers ! Mothers and daughters are part of each other ’s consciousness , in different degrees and in a different way , but still with the mutual sense of something which has always been there . A real mother is just a habit of thought to her children . Well -- this mother must put up with what she had , and make the most of it . Yes ; for Anne ’s sake she must try to make the most of it , to grope her own way and the girl ’s through this ghastly labyrinth without imperilling whatever affection Anne still felt for her . So a conscientious chaperon might have reasoned -- and what more had Kate Clephane the right to call herself ? They reached New York early in October . None of the family were in town ; even Fred Landers , uninformed of the exact date of their return , was off shooting with Horace Maclew in South Carolina . Anne had wanted their arrival to pass unperceived ; she told her mother that they would remain in town for a day or two , and then decide where to spend the rest of the autumn . On the steamer they languidly discussed alternatives ; but , from the girl ’s inability to decide , the mother guessed that she was waiting for something -- probably a letter . “
52838	52998	52999	52999	Mother	185	” They reached the house and went upstairs to their respective apartments . Everything in Anne ’s establishment was as discreetly ordered as in a club ; each lady found her correspondence in her sitting - room , and Kate Clephane , while she glanced indifferently over her own letters , sat with an anguished heart wondering what message awaited Anne . They met at dinner , and she fancied the girl looked paler and more distant than usual . After dinner the two went to Kate ’s sitting - room . Aline had already laid out some of the presents they had brought home : a Mexican turquoise ornament for Lilla , an exotic head - band of kingfishers ’ feathers for Nollie , an old Spanish chronicle for Fred Landers . Mother and daughter turned them over with affected interest ; then talk languished , and Anne rose and said goodnight . On the threshold she paused . “
53011	53020	53001	53001	I	0	” Kate started up with an impulsive gesture . “
53038	53039	53040	53040	I	0	” “
53063	53064	53065	53065	I	0	” “
53073	53090	53070	53070	I	0	” The girl still stood by the door , clutching the knob in an unconscious hand . “
53105	53113	53091	53091	I	0	” Her smile was heart - breaking . “
53172	53179	53181	53181	you	185	” Kate listened with lowered head . “
53189	53190	53181	53181	you	185	” “
53197	53209	53193	53193	I	0	” Anne answered with a faint touch of self - derision . “
53233	53234	53227	53227	I	0	” “
53236	53237	53238	53238	I	0	” “
53242	53251	53238	53238	I	0	” said the girl with an abrupt laugh . “
53266	53267	53260	53260	you	185	” “
53276	53306	53273	53274	another woman	1027	” Anne came close to her , with the same white vehement face as she had shown during their nocturnal talk at Rio . Kate ’s heart stood still . “
53310	53311	53307	53308	Another woman	1027	” “
53326	53327	53315	53315	you	185	” “
53334	53335	53336	53336	You	185	” “
53342	53356	53336	53336	You	185	” She saw the terrible flame of hope rekindling in Anne ’s eyes . “
53379	53400	53402	53402	Mother	1508	” ( Should she go on , or should she stop ? ) Anne was upon her with a cry . “
53411	53465	53407	53408	a man	2087	” Fool that she was , not to have foreseen the consequences of such a slip ! She sat before her daughter like a criminal under cross - examination , feeling that whatever word she chose would fatally lead her deeper into the slough of avowal . Anne repeated her question with insistence . “
53473	53477	53466	53466	You	185	” she added . “
53487	53488	53407	53408	a man	2087	” “
53497	53498	53492	53492	you	185	” “
53505	53518	53501	53501	I	0	” The girl stood looking at her fixedly under dark menacing brows . “
53543	53563	53564	53564	Mother	185	” Between the sentences she drew short panting breaths , as though with every word speech grew more difficult . “
53566	53571	53564	53564	Mother	185	” she broke out , “
53624	53655	53656	53656	You	185	” She burst into tears . Kate Clephane sat stupefied . She could not yet grasp the significance of the words her daughter was pouring out , and repeated dully : “
53661	53746	53656	53656	You	185	” How secret Anne must be , she thought , not only to have concealed her visit at the time , but even to have refrained from any allusion to it during their stormy talk at Rio ! How secret , since , even in moments of seeming self - abandonment , she could refrain from revealing whatever she chose to keep to herself ! More acutely than ever , the mother had the sense of being at arm ’s length from her child . “
53754	53766	53749	53749	I	0	” said Anne , speaking now in a controlled incisive voice . “
53843	53844	53846	53846	you	0	” “
53849	53856	53846	53846	you	0	” It slipped from Kate irresistibly . “
53892	53896	53897	53897	Mother	185	” She paused . “
53924	53928	53916	53916	She	1039	” Kate gasped : “
53934	53964	53965	53966	The negress	209	” Her question seemed to drop into the silence like a shout ; it was as if she had let fall a platter of brass on a marble floor . “
53968	54009	53965	53966	The negress	209	” Anne echoed . Kate Clephane sank down into the depths of her chair as if she had been withered by a touch . She pressed her elbows against her side to try to hide the trembling of her body . “
54021	54043	54012	54012	you	185	” Kate sat helpless , battling with confused possibilities of fear ; and in that moment Anne leapt on the truth . “
54072	54084	54064	54064	you	185	” The girl stood before her now like a blanched Fury . “
54093	54098	54085	54085	I	0	” Kate Clephane declared . “
54126	54184	54117	54117	You	185	” Anne ’s voice had mounted to a cry ; but suddenly she seemed to regain a sense of her surroundings . At the very moment when Kate Clephane felt the flash of the blade over her head it was arrested within a hair’s - breadth of her neck . Anne ’s voice sank to a whisper . “
54215	54255	54275	54275	you	1508	” Ah , that blessed word--_hated _ ! When the other had trembled in the very air ! The mother , bowed there , her shrunken body drawn in on itself , felt a faint expanding of the heart . “
54265	54269	54275	54275	you	1508	” she stammered . “
54277	54302	54275	54275	you	1508	” She suddenly understood that , all the while , Anne had not really believed it . But the moment for pretense was past . “
54312	54313	54303	54303	I	0	” “
54322	54323	54324	54324	Anne--	93	” “
54325	54326	54328	54328	me	0	” “
54332	54333	54328	54328	me	0	” “
54345	54354	54355	54355	You	1508	” The girl interrupted her with a laugh . “
54389	54414	54376	54376	you	1508	” She sprang to her mother and caught her by the wrists . Her hot fingers seemed to burn into Kate ’s shivering flesh . “
54454	54463	54430	54430	I	0	” The mother disengaged herself and stood up . “
54483	54491	54477	54477	I	0	” The girl seemed not to hear . “
54499	54534	54477	54477	I	0	” she wailed . A reaction of self - defence came over Kate Clephane . Anne ’s white - heat of ire seemed to turn her cold , and her self - possession returned . “
54606	54607	54602	54602	I	0	” “
54611	54615	54602	54602	I	0	” Anne shrilled . “
54636	54694	54623	54623	your	1508	” Mrs. Clephane rose with uncertain steps , and moved toward the door of her bedroom . On the threshold she paused and turned toward her daughter . Strength had come back to her with the thought that after all the only thing that mattered was to prevent this marriage . And that she might still do . “
54814	54908	54808	54808	he	186	” Anne was still staring at her with the same fixed implacable brows . Then her face broke up into the furrows of young anguish , and she became again a helpless grief - tossed girl , battling blindly with her first sorrow . She flung up her arms , buried her head in them , and sank down by the sofa . Kate watched her for a moment , hesitating ; then she stole up and laid an arm about the bowed neck . But Anne shook her off and sprang up . “
54915	54932	54808	54808	he	186	” she cried . They stood facing each other , as on that other cruel night . “
54994	55004	54982	54985	A relation like that	1063	” She flung a tragic look at her mother . “
55049	55056	55036	55036	you	1508	” She turned toward the door . “
55062	55353	55036	55036	you	1508	” Kate whispered . XVII . Two days later Fred Landers returned . Mrs. Clephane had sent a note begging him to call her up as soon as he arrived . When his call came she asked if she might dine with him that night , and he replied that she ought to have come without asking . Anne , he supposed , would honour him too ? No , she answered ; Anne , the day before , had gone down to the Drovers ’ on Long Island . She would probably be away for a few days . And would Fred please ask no one else to dine ? He assured her that such an idea would never have occurred to him . He received her in the comfortable shabby drawing - room which he had never changed since his mother and an old - maid sister had vanished from it years before . He indulged his own tastes in the library upstairs , leaving this chintzy room , with its many armchairs , the Steinway piano and the family Chippendale , much as Kate had known it when old Mrs. Landers had given her a bridal dinner . The memory of that dinner , and of Mrs. Landers , large , silvery , demonstrative , flashed through Mrs. Clephane ’s mind . She saw herself in an elaborately looped gown , proudly followed by her husband , and enclosed in her hostess ’s rustling embrace , while her present host , crimson with emotion and admiration , hung shyly behind his mother ; and the memory gave her a pang of self - pity . In the middle of the room she paused and looked about her . “
55359	55400	55401	55401	You	1066	” she said , without knowing what she was saying . A flush almost as agitated as the one she remembered mounted to Landers ’s forehead . She saw his confusion and pleasure , and was remotely touched by them . “
55408	55416	55404	55404	I	0	” she explained with a faint smile . “
55419	55420	55036	55036	you	1508	” “
55444	55445	55437	55438	a wanderer	1067	” “
55451	55574	55437	55438	a wanderer	1067	” he smiled . The double mahogany doors were thrown open . Landers , with his stiff little bow , offered her an arm , and they passed into a dusky flock - papered dining - room which seemed to borrow most of its lighting from the sturdy silver and monumental cut - glass of the dinner - table . A bunch of violets , compact and massive , lay by her plate . Everything about Fred Landers was old - fashioned , solid and authentic . She sank into her chair with a sense of its being a place of momentary refuge . She did not mean to speak till after dinner -- then she would tell him everything she thought . “
55580	55620	55437	55438	a wanderer	1067	” she murmured , smelling the violets . In the library , after dinner , Landers settled her in his deepest armchair , moved the lamp away , pressed a glass of old Chartreuse on her , and said : “
55628	55726	55437	55438	a wanderer	1067	” The suddenness and the perspicacity of the question took her by surprise . She had imagined he would leave the preliminaries to her , or at any rate beat about the subject in a clumsy effort to get at it . But she perceived that , awkward and almost timorous as he remained in smaller ways , the mere habit of life had given him a certain self - assurance at important moments . It was she who now felt a tremor of reluctance . How could she tell him -- what could she tell him ? “
55739	55743	55732	55732	I	0	” she began . “
55776	55777	55764	55764	Anne	95	” “
55781	55782	55792	55792	she	95	” “
55787	55788	55792	55792	she	95	” “
55799	55826	55792	55792	she	95	” Mrs. Clephane nodded . Fred Landers stood leaning against the mantelpiece , an unlit cigar in his hand . His face expressed perplexity and perturbation . “
55842	55843	55836	55836	She	95	” “
55857	55858	55853	55855	a travelling companion	1071	” “
55870	55871	55853	55855	a travelling companion	1071	” “
55892	55893	55932	55932	you	1068	” “
55898	55906	55907	55907	You	1068	” It was her turn to flush . “
55924	55929	55932	55932	you	1068	” He seemed embarrassed . “
55938	56329	56330	56330	He	1074	” She hesitated a moment ; then she began . It was not the story she had meant to tell ; she had hardly opened her lips before she understood that it would be as impossible to tell that to Fred Landers as to Anne . For an instant , as he welcomed her to the familiar house , so full of friendly memories , she had had the illusion of nearness to him , the sense of a brotherly reassuring presence . But as she began to speak of Chris every one else in her new life except her daughter became remote and indistinct to her . She supposed it could not be otherwise . She had chosen to cast her lot elsewhere , and now , coming back after so many years , she found the sense of intimacy and confidence irreparably destroyed . What did she really know of the present Fred Landers , or he of her ? All she found herself able to say was that when she had heard that Anne meant to marry Chris Fenno she had thought it her duty to try to prevent the marriage ; and that the girl had guessed her interference and could not forgive her . She elaborated on this , lingering over the relatively insignificant details of her successive talks with her daughter in the attempt to delay the moment when Landers should begin to question her . She saw that he was deeply disturbed , but perhaps not altogether sorry . He had never liked Chris , she knew , and the news of the engagement was clearly a shock to him . He said he had seen and heard nothing of Fenno since Anne and her mother had left . Landers , who could not recall that either Horace Maclew or Lilla had ever mentioned him , had concluded that the young man was no longer a member of their household , and probably not even in Baltimore . If he were , Lilla would have been sure to keep her hold on him ; he was too useful a diner and dancer to be lost sight of -- and much more in Lilla ’s line , one would have fancied , than in Anne ’s . Kate Clephane winced at the unconscious criticism . “
56340	56362	56330	56330	He	1074	” she said with a faint sigh of relief . Fred Landers continued to lean meditatively against the chimney - piece . “
56375	56383	56370	56370	herself	95	” he asked , after another interval . “
56409	56445	56399	56399	I	0	” Instantly she saw how he would interpret her avowal , and her colour rose again . She must have felt , then , that she knew Major Fenno better ; the inference was inevitable . “
56455	56459	56446	56446	You	1075	” She hesitated . “
56470	56471	56467	56467	he	186	” “
56475	56479	56467	56467	he	186	” he sighed . “
56501	56506	56507	56507	I	0	” Again she faltered . “
56539	56540	56529	56529	I	0	” “
56576	56577	56568	56568	I	0	” “
56581	56588	56568	56568	I	0	” She looked up in dismay . “
56621	56622	56623	56623	I	0	” “
56634	56643	56633	56633	you	94	must!”--Her eyes clung imploringly to his troubled face . “
56707	56788	56699	56699	you	0	” She had lowered her head again , and sat desolately staring at the floor . With the little wood - fire playing on the hearth , and this honest kindly man looking down at her , how safe and homelike the room seemed ! Yet her real self was not in it at all , but blown about on a lonely wind of anguish , outside in the night . And so it would always be , she supposed . “
56801	56819	56791	56791	you	0	” she heard Landers repeat . The answer choked in her throat . Finally she brought out : “
56837	56838	56833	56833	He	1079	” “
56859	56860	56848	56848	you	0	” “
56872	56873	56848	56848	you	0	” “
56886	56896	56900	56900	she	1081	” The words shot through her like a stab . “
56907	56908	56903	56903	she	1081	” “
56920	56990	56909	56909	You	0	” Kate Clephane put up her hands and pressed them against her ears . She could not bear to hear another question . What had been the use of coming to Fred Landers ? He had no help to give her , and his insight had only served to crystallize her hazy terrors . She rose slowly from her armchair and held out her hand with a struggling smile . “
57004	57005	56995	56995	I	0	” “
57012	57013	57007	57007	you	0	” “
57039	57040	57041	57041	Your	0	” “
57079	57087	57090	57090	Fred	94	” She put her hand in his . “
57096	57097	57094	57094	you	94	” “
57108	57120	57098	57098	I	0	” he said , as he followed her down the stairs . “
57128	57317	57122	57122	you	0	” The taxi he had called carried her back to her desolate house . XVIII . Her place was beside Anne -- that was all she had got out of Fred Landers . And in that respect she was by no means convinced that her instinct was not surer than his , that she was not right in agreeing with her daughter that their experiment had been a failure . Yet , even if it had , she could not leave Anne now ; not till she had made sure there was no further danger from Chris . Ah -- if she were once certain of that , it would perhaps be easiest and simplest to go ! But not till then . She did not know when Anne was coming back ; no word had come from her . Mrs. Clephane had an idea that the house - keeper knew ; but she could not ask the house - keeper . So for another twenty - four hours she remained on , with a curious sense of ghostly unconcern , while she watched Aline unpack her trunks and “
57319	57400	57401	57401	She	1082	” her into her rooms for the winter . It was on the third day that Nollie Tresselton telephoned . She was in town , and asked if she might see Mrs. Clephane at once . The very sound of her voice brought reassurance ; and Kate Clephane sat counting the minutes till she appeared . She had come up from the Drovers ’ , as Kate had guessed ; and she brought an embarrassed message of apology from Anne . “
57435	57436	57440	57440	her	1082	” “
57446	57488	57440	57440	her	1082	” the mother cried , her eyes searching the other ’s face . But Nollie ’s vivid features were obscured by the embarrassment of the message she had brought . She looked as if she were tangled in Anne ’s confusion . “
57493	57498	57440	57440	her	1082	” Kate Clephane repeated . “
57517	57523	57509	57509	I	0	” Mrs. Tresselton looked relieved . “
57540	57557	57536	57536	I	0	” She hesitated , and then went on , with a slight tremor in her voice : “
57571	57588	57589	57589	Nollie	154	” But she stopped again , and Kate , with a sinking heart , stood up . “
57597	57598	57591	57591	she	1082	” “
57626	57627	57620	57620	she	1082	” “
57637	57651	57629	57629	she	1082	” The younger woman laid a pleading hand on Mrs. Clephane ’s arm . “
57673	57674	57660	57660	She	1082	” “
57689	57690	57682	57682	she	1082	” “
57712	57713	57710	57710	she	1082	” “
57716	57717	57710	57710	she	1082	” “
57730	57743	57744	57744	Nollie	154	” Mrs. Clephane caught at the hand that lay on her arm . “
57757	57758	57752	57752	She	1082	” “
57792	57818	57819	57820	Aunt Kate	161	” The younger woman broke off and looked at Mrs. Clephane compassionately , as if trying to make her understand the hopelessness of the struggle . “
57829	57830	57819	57820	Aunt Kate	161	” “
57848	57930	57819	57820	Aunt Kate	161	” Mrs. Tresselton was silent ; the pity in her gaze had turned to a guarded coolness . Of course Nollie could n’t understand -- never would ! Of course they were all on Anne ’s side . Kate Clephane stood looking helplessly about her . The memory of old scenes under that same roof -- threats , discussions , dissimulations and inward revolts -- arose within her , and she felt on her shoulders the whole oppression of the past . “
57935	57943	57819	57820	Aunt Kate	161	” Nollie continued , her expression softening , “
58057	58067	58044	58044	her	95	” Mrs. Clephane lifted imploring eyes to her face . “
58092	58093	58094	58094	I	0	” “
58101	58112	58098	58099	Aunt Kate	161	” The young woman stood before her , affectionately perplexed . “
58128	58129	58130	58130	I	0	” “
58137	58141	58130	58130	I	0	” Kate panted . “
58148	58199	58201	58202	Fred Landers	94	” Silence fell -- always the same silence . Kate glanced desperately about the imprisoning room . Every panel and moulding of its walls , every uncompromising angle or portly curve of its decorous furniture , seemed equally leagued against her , forbidding her , defying her , to speak . “
58204	58211	58201	58202	Fred Landers	94	” she said , at bay . “
58238	58239	58225	58225	he	94	” “
58278	58313	58273	58273	I	0	” The words came from her precipitate and shrill ; she felt she was losing all control of her face and voice , and lifted her handkerchief to her lips to hide their twitching . “
58317	58388	58314	58315	Aunt Kate--	212	” Nollie Tresselton gasped it out on a new note of terror ; then she too fell silent , slowly turning her eyes away . In that instant Kate Clephane saw that she had guessed , or if not , was at least on the point of guessing ; and fresh alarm possessed the mother . She tried to steady herself , to raise new defences against this new danger . “
58435	58436	58314	58315	Aunt Kate--	212	” “
58441	58471	58314	58315	Aunt Kate--	212	” The word was said . She had been challenged again , and had again shrunk away from the challenge . Nollie Tresselton drew a deep breath of relief . “
58501	58502	58492	58492	you	0	” “
58513	58528	58529	58529	I	0	” The younger woman considered ; then she took Mrs. Clephane by the hand . “
58559	58591	58592	58592	Anne	95	” Nollie was again silent , and Mrs. Clephane understood that , whatever happened , the secret of Chris ’s exact whereabouts was to be kept from her . She thought : “
58602	58819	58592	58592	Anne	95	” and there was a sort of fierce satisfaction in the thought . Nollie was gathering up her wrap and hand - bag . She had to get back to Long Island , she said ; Kate understood that she meant to return to the Drovers ’ . As she reached the door a last impulse of avowal seized the older woman . What if , by giving Nollie a hint of the truth , she could make sure of her support and thus secure Anne ’s safety ? But what argument against the marriage would be more efficacious on Nollie ’s lips than on her own ? One only -- the one that no one must ever use . The terror lest Nollie , possessed of that truth , and sickened by it , should after all reveal it in a final effort to prevent the marriage , prevailed over Mrs. Clephane ’s other fears . Once Nollie knew , Anne would surely get to know ; the horror of that possibility sealed the mother ’s lips . Nollie , from the threshold , still looked at her wistfully , expectantly , as if half - awaiting the confession ; but Mrs. Clephane held out her hand without a word . * * * * * “
58828	59088	59089	59089	I	0	” It was Kate ’s first thought after the door had closed on her visitor . If he were in New York -- and he evidently was -- she , Kate Clephane , must run him down , must get speech with him , before he had been able to see her daughter . But how was she to set about it ? Fred Landers did not even know if he were still with Horace Maclew or not -- for the mere fact of Maclew ’s not alluding to him while they were together meant nothing , less than nothing . And even if he had left the Maclews , the chances were that Lilla knew where he was , and had already transmitted Anne ’s summons . Mrs. Clephane consulted the telephone book , but of course in vain . Then , after some hesitation , she rang up Horace Maclew ’s house in Baltimore . No one was there , but she finally elicited from the servant who answered the telephone that Mrs. Maclew was away on a motor trip . Perhaps Mr. Maclew could be reached at his country - place .... Kate tried the country - place , but Mr. Maclew had gone to Chicago . The sense of loneliness and helplessness closed in on her more impenetrably than ever . Night came , and Aline reminded her that she had asked to have her dinner brought up on a tray . Solitary meals in John Clephane ’s dining - room were impossible to her . “
59096	59114	59089	59089	I	0	” Aline ’s look seemed to say that she knew why , and her mistress hastily emended : “
59125	59224	59225	59226	The gentleman	1100	” She sat down to it without changing her dress . Every gesture , every act , denoting intimacy with that house , or the air of permanence in her relation to it , would also have been impossible . Again she had the feeling of sitting in a railway station , waiting for a train to come in . But now she knew for what she was waiting . At the close of her brief meal Aline entered briskly with fruit and coffee . Her harsh face illuminated with curiosity , she handed her mistress a card . “
59238	59245	59246	59246	Madame	1453	” Her tone seemed to imply : “
59258	59442	59246	59246	Madame	1453	” and Kate cast a startled glance at the name . He had come to her , then -- had come of his own accord ! She felt dizzy with relief and fear . Fear uppermost -- yes ; was she not always afraid of him ? XIX . Chris Fenno stood in the drawing - room . The servant who received him had turned on a blast of lamps and wall - lights , and in the hard overhead glare he looked drawn and worn , like a man recovering from severe illness . His clothes , too , Kate fancied , were shabbier ; everything in his appearance showed a decline , a defeat . She had not much believed in his illness when Nollie spoke of it ; the old habit of incredulity was too strong in her . But now his appearance moved her . She felt herself responsible , almost guilty . But for her folly , she thought , he might have been standing before her with a high head , on easy terms with the world . “
59448	59458	59246	59246	Madame	1453	” she exclaimed . His gesture brushed that aside . “
59466	59476	59246	59246	Madame	1453	” He looked her in the face and added : “
59486	59490	59246	59246	Madame	1453	” She faltered : “
59497	59533	59492	59492	you	1104	” Inwardly she had already begun to tremble . When his blue eyes turned to that harsh slate - gray , and the two perpendicular lines deepened between his brows , she had always trembled . “
59540	59552	59553	59553	I	0	” he retorted , his voice as harsh as his eyes . “
59555	59556	59553	59553	I	0	” “
59577	59602	59569	59569	I	0	” He flung out the short sentences like blows . Her heart was beating so wildly that she could not follow what he said . “
59608	59612	59605	59605	you	1104	” she stammered . “
59763	59803	59751	59751	he	1109	” It was only in the white - heat of anger that he spoke with such violence , and at such length ; he seemed spent , and desperately at bay , and the thought gave Kate Clephane courage . “
59810	59847	59806	59806	you	1104	” she asked . His expression changed , as she had so often seen it change . From menace it passed to petulance and then became almost pleading in its perplexity . She said to herself : “
59871	59900	59862	59862	he	1109	” But even then she felt the precariousness of the advantage . His ready wit had so often served him instead of resolution . It served him now . “
59911	59943	59901	59901	You	0	” he retorted . She stood silent , feeling herself defeated , and at the same time humiliated that their angry thoughts should have dragged them down to such a level . “
59947	59951	59952	59952	Sneer	216	” she faltered . “
60048	60049	60038	60038	you	0	” “
60057	60058	60050	60050	I	0	” “
60081	60082	60090	60090	She	95	” “
60117	60118	60114	60114	She	95	” “
60126	60127	60120	60120	you	0	” “
60141	60142	60135	60135	You	0	” “
60172	60185	60186	60186	Chris	88	” She stretched out her hands as if to catch him back . “
60206	60301	60202	60202	you	88	” He stood leaning against the chimney - piece , his arms crossed , his head a little bent and thrust forward , in the attitude of sullen obstinacy that she knew so well . And all at once in her own cry she heard the echo of other cries , other entreaties . She saw herself in another scene , stretching her arms to him in the same desperate entreaty , with the same sense of her inability to move him , even to reach him . Her tears overflowed and ran down . “
60311	60321	60302	60302	You	88	” she whispered . He kept his dogged attitude . “
60331	60332	60322	60322	I	0	” “
60352	60527	60528	60528	Kate	87	” As the cry died on her lips she understood that , in uttering it , she had at last cast herself completely on his mercy . For it was not impossible that , if other means failed , he would risk justifying himself to Anne by revealing the truth . There were times when he was reckless enough to risk anything . And if Kate were right in her conjecture -- if he had the audacity he affected -- then his hold over her was complete , and he knew it . If any one else told Anne , the girl ’s horror would turn her from him at once . But what if he himself told her ? All this flashed on Kate Clephane in the same glare of enlightenment . There was a long silence . She had sunk into a chair and hidden her face in her hands . Presently , through the enveloping cloud of her misery , she felt his nearness , and a touch on her shoulder . “
60540	60561	60528	60528	Kate	87	” She lifted her eyes and met his fugitively . They had lost their harshness , and were almost frightened . “
60575	60579	60570	60571	a man	2087	” he continued . “
60658	60669	60689	60689	Her	95	” She lowered her eyes and voice to whisper painfully : “
60678	60679	60689	60689	Her	95	” “
60682	60683	60684	60684	Her	95	” “
60687	60688	60689	60689	Her	95	” “
60693	60743	60689	60689	Her	95	” His words made her tremble again ; there had always been moments when his reasonableness alarmed her more than his anger , because she knew that , to be so gentle , he must be certain of eventually gaining his point . But she gathered resolution to say : “
60783	60787	60789	60789	you	0	” she panted , “
60801	60816	60789	60789	you	0	” His hand fell from her shoulder , and he drew back a step . “
60829	60900	60901	60901	You	0	” Mrs. Clephane stood up . She remembered wondering long ago -- one day when he had been very tender -- how cruel Chris could be . The conjecture , then , had seemed whimsical , almost morbid ; now she understood that she had guessed in him from the outset this genius for reaching , at the first thrust , to the central point of his antagonist ’s misery . “
60909	60910	60901	60901	You	0	” “
60929	60930	60923	60923	she	1455	” “
60945	60946	60941	60941	she	1455	” “
60960	60975	60976	60976	She	1455	” He wavered again for a second or two , and then brought out : “
60999	61000	60986	60986	She	1455	” “
61014	61015	61008	61008	she	1455	” “
61039	61040	61034	61034	she	1455	” “
61045	61088	61089	61089	I	0	” Again he made an embarrassed gesture of acquiescence . Kate Clephane stood looking about the rich glaring room . She felt like a dizzy moth battering itself to death against that implacable blaze . She closed her lids for an instant . “
61103	61120	61096	61096	I	0	” she said suddenly . He stood in the doorway , his hard gaze upon her . “
61139	61193	61194	61194	He	1119	” he said . XX . He must have been very sure of her not acting on his final challenge , or he would not have dared to make it . That was the continuous refrain of Kate Clephane ’s thoughts as the train carried her down to Long Island the next morning . “
61209	61481	61206	61206	I	0	” The thought sustained her through the long sleepless night , and gave her the strength and clearness of mind to decide that she must at once see Anne , however little her daughter might desire the meeting . After all , she still had that weapon in her depleted armoury : she could reveal the truth . At the station she found one of the Drover motors , and remembered with a start that it was a Saturday , and that she would probably come upon a large house - party at her sister - in - law ’s . But to her relief she learned that the motor had only brought a departing visitor to the up - train . She asked to be driven back in it , and in a few moments was rolling between the wrought - iron gates and down the long drive to the house . The front door stood open , and she went into the hall . The long oak tables were so laden with golf - sticks , tennis racquets and homespun garments that she saw she had been right in guessing she would encounter a houseful . But it was too late to turn back ; and besides , what did the other people matter ? They might , if they were numerous enough , make it easier for her to isolate herself with Anne . The hall seemed empty ; but as she advanced she saw a woman ’s figure lazily outstretched in a deep armchair before the fire . Lilla Maclew rose from the chair to greet her . “
61487	61586	61587	61587	Hallo	219	” Mrs. Clephane caught the embarrassment in her niece ’s rich careless voice , and guessed that the family had already been made aware of the situation existing between Anne and Anne ’s mother , and probably , therefore , of the girl ’s engagement . But Lilla Maclew was even more easy , self - confident and indifferent than Lilla Gates had been . The bolder dash of peroxyde on her hair , and the glint of jewels on her dusky skin , made her look like a tall bronze statue with traces of gilding on it . “
61589	61596	61587	61587	Hallo	219	” she repeated , rather blankly ; “
61603	61604	61598	61598	you	219	” “
61612	61656	61657	61657	Anne	95	” Anne ’s mother answered . Lilla ’s constraint visibly increased , and with it her sullen reluctance to make any unnecessary effort . One had n’t married money , her tone proclaimed , to be loaded up like this with family bothers . “
61703	61743	61697	61697	mother	1508	” She glanced irritably around her , as if her look ought to have been potent enough to summon her mother to the spot ; and apparently it was , for a door opened , and Mrs. Drover appeared . “
61759	61854	61756	61756	you	87	” Her hostess ’s mild countenance betrayed the same embarrassment as Lilla ’s , and under it Mrs. Clephane detected the same aggrieved surprise . Having at last settled her own daughter ’s difficulties , Mrs. Drover ’s eyes seemed to ask , why should she so soon be called upon to deal with another family disturbance ? Even juries , after a protracted trial , are excused from service for seven years ; yet here she was being drawn into the thick of a new quarrel when the old one was barely composed . “
61859	61876	61855	61855	Anne	95	” she added , offering a cool pink cheek to her sister - in - law . “
61889	61894	61883	61883	I	0	” Kate said timidly . “
61907	61919	61901	61901	You	1477	” Mrs. Drover ’s naturally ceremonious manner became stiff with apprehension . “
61989	62004	62005	62005	We	1127	” She rang and gave orders that another seat should be put at table . “
62038	62050	62028	62028	Dawson	220	” she asked the butler . Under her breath she added : “
62055	62265	62267	62267	Anne	95	” If we ever need it , she concluded in a parenthetic glance , it will be today ! The hall was already filling up with a jocund bustle of Drovers and Tresseltons . Young , middle - aged and elderly , they poured out of successive motors , all ruddy , prosperous , clamouring for food . Hardly distinguishable from the family were the week - end friends returning with them from one sportive spectacle or another . As Kate Clephane stood among them , going through the mechanical gestures of greeting and small - talk , she felt so tenuous and spectral that she almost wondered how she could be visible to their hearty senses . They were all glad to see her , all a little surprised at her being there , and all soon forgetful of their own surprise in discussing the more important questions of polo , tennis and lunch . Once more she had the impression of being hurried with them down a huge sliding stairway that perpetually revolved upon itself , and once more she recalled her difficulty in telling one of them from another , and in deciding whether it was the Tresseltons or the Drovers who had the smallest noses . “
62273	62313	62314	62314	Anne	95	” Hendrik Drover enquired , steering the tide of arrivals toward the shining stretch of a long luncheon - table . He put Mrs. Clephane at his left , and added , as he settled her in her seat : “
62336	62803	62334	62334	Joe	143	” He did not wait for Joe Tresselton ’s answer , but addressed himself hurriedly to the lady on his right . Kate had the feeling that they all thought she had committed an error of taste in appearing among them at that particular moment , but that it was no business of theirs , after all , and they must act in concert in affecting that nothing could be more natural . The Drovers and Tresseltons were great at acting in concert , and at pretending that whatever happened was natural , usual , and not of a character to interfere with one ’s lunch . When a member of the tribe was ill , the best doctors and most expensive nurses were summoned , but the illness was spoken of as a trifling indisposition ; when misfortune befell any one of them , it was not spoken of at all . Taking Lilla for granted had brought this art to the highest point of perfection , and her capture of Horace Maclew had fully confirmed its usefulness . All this flashed through Kate Clephane while she refused the champagne ordered on her behalf , and pretended to eat Maryland chicken and corn _ soufflé _ ; but under the surface - rattle of her thoughts a watchful spirit brooded haggardly on the strangeness and unreality of the scene . She had come , in agony of soul , to seek her daughter , to have speech with her at all costs ; and the daughter was away watching a tennis match , and no one seemed surprised or concerned . Life , even Anne ’s life , was going on in its usual easy way . The girl had found her betrothed again , and been reunited to him ; what would it matter to her , or to her approving family , if the intruder who for a few months had gone through the pretence of being one of them , and whose delusion they had good - naturedly abetted , should vanish again from the group ? As she looked at them all , so obtuse and so powerful , so sure of themselves and each other , her own claim to belong to them became incredible even to herself . She had made her choice long ago , and she had not chosen them ; and now their friendly indifference made the fact clear . Well -- perhaps it also made her own course clearer . She was as much divided from them already as death could divide her . Why not die , then -- die altogether ? She would tell Anne the truth , and then go away and never see her again ; and that would be death .... “
62810	62901	62334	62334	Joe	143	” Hendrik Drover called out genially . Lunch was over ; the guests , scattered about in the hall and billiard - room , were lighting their cigarettes over coffee and liqueurs . Mrs. Clephane , who had drifted out with the rest , and mechanically taken her cup of coffee as the tray passed her , lifted her head and saw Anne and Nollie Tresselton . Anne entered first . She paused to take off her motor coat , glanced indifferently about her , and said to Mrs. Drover : “
62924	62970	62971	62971	Mother	1508	” Then she saw her mother and her pale cheek whitened . Mrs. Clephane ’s eyes filled , and she stood motionless . Everything about her was so blurred and wavering that she dared not stir , or even attempt to set down her cup . “
62973	63024	62971	62971	Mother	1508	” the girl exclaimed . With a quick movement she made her way through the cluster of welcoming people , and went up with outstretched arms to Mrs. Clephane . For a moment the two held each other ; then Mrs. Drover , beaming up to them , said benevolently : “
63046	63094	63095	63095	She	973	” and dazed , trembling , half - fearing she was in a dream from which the waking would be worse than death , Mrs. Clephane found herself mounting the stairs with her daughter . On the first landing she regained her senses , said to herself : “
63107	63182	63183	63183	Mother	185	” and tried to stiffen her soul against this new form of anguish . Anne moved silently at her side . After the first cry and the first kiss she had drawn back into herself , perhaps obscurely conscious of some inward resistance in her mother . But when the bedroom door had closed on them she drew Mrs. Clephane down into an armchair , dropped on her knees beside it , and whispered : “
63196	63252	63253	63253	Anne	95	” The words sounded like an echo of the dear unuttered things the mother had heard said to herself long ago , in her endless dialogues with an invisible Anne . No tears rose to her eyes , but their flood seemed to fill her thirsty breast . She drew Anne ’s head against it . “
63258	63303	63255	63256	little Anne	95	” Her fingers crept through the warm crinklings of hair , wound about the turn of the temples , and slipped down the cheeks . She shut her eyes , softly saying over her daughter ’s name . Anne was the first to speak . “
63317	63318	63310	63310	I	0	” “
63327	63328	63321	63321	you	95	” “
63339	63340	63334	63334	You	95	” “
63348	63371	63374	63374	him	1142	” There was a slight pause ; then , raising herself , the girl slipped her arms about her mother ’s neck . “
63379	63411	63412	63412	Mother	1508	” The chill of reality smote through Mrs. Clephane ’s happy trance . She felt herself turning again into the desolate stranger who had stood below watching for Anne ’s return . “
63422	63430	63417	63417	I	0	” she heard the girl entreating ; and “
63435	63528	63417	63417	I	0	” the inward voice admonished her . Now indeed was the time to speak ; to make an end . It was clear that no compromise would be of any use . Anne had obviously imagined that her mother had come to forgive and be forgiven , and that Chris was to be included in the general amnesty . On no other terms would any amnesty be accepted . Through the girl ’s endearments Kate felt , as never before , the steely muscles of her resolution . Anne pressed her closer . “
63611	63617	63603	63603	I	0	” the girl hurried on . “
63663	63683	63684	63684	Mothers	2477	” She lifted her face close to Mrs. Clephane ’s to add , with a half - whimsical smile : “
63693	63740	63684	63684	Mothers	2477	” Kate Clephane sat motionless in that persuasive hold . It did not seem to her , at the moment , as if she and her child were two , but as if her whole self had passed into the young body pressed pleadingly against her . “
63754	63760	63761	63761	You	1508	” was her only thought . “
63764	63771	63761	63761	You	1508	” the cajoling voice went on , “
63894	63899	63891	63891	you	1508	” Kate Clephane assented : “
63905	63906	63891	63891	you	1508	” “
63980	63981	63982	63982	You	1508	” “
63988	63989	63982	63982	You	1508	” “
64064	64106	64061	64061	I	0	” Kate felt as if it were her own sobs that were shaking her daughter ’s body . She held her fast , saying over and over , as a mother would to a child that has fallen and hurt itself : “
64115	64168	64170	64170	Anne	95	” She no longer knew what she herself was feeling . All her consciousness had passed into Anne . This young anguish , which is the hardest of all to bear , must be allayed : she was ready to utter any words that should lift that broken head from her breast . “
64179	64419	64174	64174	I	0	” she whispered . And as she spoke she felt herself instantly caught in the tight net of her renunciation . If she did not tell Anne now she would never tell her -- and it was exactly on this that Chris had counted . He had known that she would never speak . XXI . It had been decided that Mrs. Clephane must , of course , stay over the Sunday ; on Monday morning she would return to town with Anne . Meanwhile Aline was summoned with week - end raiment ; and Kate Clephane , after watching the house - party drive off to a distant polo match , remained alone in the great house with her sister - in - law . Mrs. Drover ’s countenance , though worn from the strain of incessant hospitality , had lost its look of perturbation . It was clear that the affectionate meeting between mother and daughter had been a relief to the whole family , and Mrs. Drover ’s ingenuous eye declared that since now , thank heaven , that matter was settled , there need be no farther pretence of mystery . She invited her sister - in - law to join her in her own sitting - room over a quiet cup of tea , and as she poured it out observed with a smile that she supposed the wedding would take place before Christmas . “
64427	64428	64423	64423	Anne	95	” “
64463	64476	64451	64451	She	95	” Wrinkles of apprehension reluctantly reformed themselves on Mrs. Drover ’s brow . “
64492	64499	64500	64500	Hendrik	159	” her look seemed to protest . “
64512	64562	64506	64507	Major Fenno	186	” she continued , in a tone that amicably sought to dismiss the subject . Kate Clephane put down her untasted cup . What could she answer ? What was the use of answering at all ? Misled by her silence , Mrs. Drover pursued with a clearing brow : “
64621	64622	64625	64625	Enid	145	” “
64633	64677	64627	64627	Anne	95	” Kate Clephane cried , starting to her feet . Mrs. Drover set down her own cup . Lines of disapproval hardened about her small concise mouth ; but she had evidently resolved to restrain herself to the last limit of sisterly forbearance . “
64934	64951	64926	64926	Lilla	153	” Kate Clephane had reseated herself and was automatically turning the spoon about in her cup . “
64967	65083	64962	64962	he	181	” The thought , flashing in on her aching brain , suddenly quieted her , helped her to compose her features , and even to interject the occasional vague murmur which was all her sister - in - law needed to feed her flow of talk . The mention of the Maclews and their clever architect had served to deflect the current of Mrs. Drover ’s thoughts , and presently she was describing how wonderfully Lilla managed Horace , and how she and the architect had got him to think he could not live without the very alterations he had begun by resolutely opposing , on the ground that they were both extravagant and unnecessary . “
65116	65138	65103	65103	he	1175	” Mrs. Drover chuckled ; and then , her voice softening , and a plump hand reassuringly outstretched to Mrs. Clephane : “
65168	65169	65139	65139	You	1173	” “
65185	65351	65112	65112	his	1175	” the other mother continued to murmur to herself . * * * * * Horace Maclew , among numerous other guests , arrived for dinner . He sat nearly opposite Mrs. Clephane , and in the strange whirl and dazzle that surrounded her she instinctively anchored her gaze on his broad frame and ponderous countenance . What had his marriage done to him , she wondered , and what weight had it given him in the counsels of his new family ? She had known of him but vaguely before , as the conscientious millionaire who collects works of art and relieves suffering ; she imagined him as having been brought up by equally conscientious parents , themselves wealthy and scrupulous , and sincerely anxious to transmit their scruples , with their millions , to their only son . But other influences and tendencies had also been in play ; one could fancy him rather heavily adjusting them to his inherited principles , with the “
65354	65502	65103	65103	he	1175	” designed to cover venial lapses . His marriage with Lilla must have been the outcome , the climax , of these private concessions , and have prepared him to view most of the problems of life from an easier angle . Undoubtedly , among the men present , though no quicker - witted than the others , he would have been the one most likely to understand Kate Clephane ’s case , could she have put it to him . But to do so -- one had only to intercept their glances across the table to be sure of it -- would have been to take Lilla also into her confidence ; and it suddenly became clear to Mrs. Clephane that no recoil of horror , and no Pharisaical disapproval , would be as intolerable to her as Lilla ’s careless stare and Lilla ’s lazy : “
65525	66531	66532	66532	My	0	” It did , no doubt ; Mrs. Clephane had already tried to adjust her own mind to that . She had known such cases ; everybody had ; she had seen them smoothed over and lived down ; but that she and Anne should ever figure as one of them was beyond human imagining . She would have felt herself befouled to the depths by Lilla ’s tolerance . Her unquiet eyes wandered from Horace Maclew to her daughter . Anne shone with recovered joy . Her anxiety had left only the happy traces of a summer shower on a drooping garden . Every now and then she smiled across the table at her mother , and Kate felt herself irresistibly smiling back . There was something so rich , dense and impregnable in the fact of possessing Anne ’s heart that the mother could not remember to be alarmed when their eyes met . Suddenly she noticed that Anne was absorbed in conversation with one of her neighbours . This was the Reverend Dr. Arklow , Rector of St. Stephen ’s , the New York church of the Clephane and Drover clan . Old Mrs. Clephane had been a pillar of St. Stephen ’s , and had bequeathed a handsome sum to the parish . Dr. Arklow , formerly the curate , had come back a few years previously as Rector of the church , and was now regarded as one of the foremost lights of the diocese , with a strong possibility of being named its Coadjutor , or possibly Bishop of the American Episcopal Churches in Europe . The Drovers and all their tribe took their religion with moderation : they subscribed handsomely to parochial charities , the older members of the family still went to church on Sunday mornings , and once in the winter each of the family invited the Rector to a big dinner . But their relations with him , though amicable , were purely formal , and Kate concluded that his presence at one of the Drover week - ends was to be attributed to the prestige he had acquired as a certain Coadjutor or possible Bishop . The Drover social scheme was like a game of chess in which Bishops counted considerably more than Rectors . The Rector of St. Stephen ’s struck Mrs. Clephane , who had met him only once before , as a man accustomed to good company , and eager to prove it . He had a face as extensive as Mr. Maclew ’s but running to length instead of width . His thin gray hair was carefully brushed back from a narrow benevolent forehead , and though he loved a good cigar , and wore a pepper - and - salt suit on his travels , he knew his value as a decorative element , and was fastidiously clerical on social occasions . His manly chest seemed outspread to receive the pectoral cross , and all his gestures were round and full , like the sleeves for which they were preparing . As he leaned back , listening to Anne with lowered lids , and finger - tips thoughtfully laid against each other , his occasional faint smile and murmur of assent suggested to Mrs. Clephane that the girl was discussing with him the arrangements for the wedding ; and the mother , laying down her fork , closed her eyes for an instant while the big resonant room reeled about her . Then she said to herself that , after all , this was only what was to be expected , and that if she had n’t the courage to face such a possibility , and many others like it , she would assuredly never have the courage to carry out the plan which , all through the afternoon and evening , had been slowly forming in her mind . That plan was simply , for the present , to hold fast to Anne , and let things follow their course . She would return to New York the next day with Anne , she would passively assist at her daughter ’s preparations -- for an active share in them seemed beyond her powers -- and she would be there when Chris came , and when they announced the engagement . Whatever happened , she would be there . She would let Chris see at once that he would have to reckon with that . And how would he be able to reckon with it ? How could he stand it , day after day ? They would perhaps never exchange another word in private -- she prayed they might not -- but he would understand by her mere presence what she meant , what she was determined on . He would understand that in the end he would have to give up Anne because she herself would never do so . The struggle between them would become a definite , practical , circumscribed thing ; and , knowing Chris as she did , she felt almost sure she could hold out longer than he . This new resolve gave her a sort of light - headed self - confidence : when she left the dinner - table she felt so easy and careless that she was surprised to see that the glass of champagne beside her plate was untouched . She felt as if all its sparkles were whirling through her . On the return of the gentlemen to the drawing - room Dr. Arklow moved to her side , and she welcomed him with a smile . He opened with some mild generalities , and she said to herself that he was too anxiously observant of the social rules to speak of her daughter ’s marriage before she herself alluded to it . For a few minutes she strove to find a word which should provide him with an opening ; but to say to any one : “
66539	66652	66653	66653	I	0	” was beyond her , and they lingered on among slumbrous platitudes . Suddenly Anne drifted up , sat down an on arm of her mother ’s chair , and took her mother ’s hand . Kate ’s eyes filled , and through their mist she fancied she saw Dr. Arklow looking at her attentively . For the first time it occurred to her that , behind the scrupulous social puppet , there might be a simple - hearted man , familiar with the humble realities of pain and perplexity , and experienced in dealing with them . The thought gave her a sense of relief , and she said to herself : “
66675	66694	66695	66695	Our	1182	” But meanwhile she merely continued to smile up at her daughter , and Dr. Arklow to say : “
66731	66746	66747	66749	Miss Anne Clephane	95	” None of the three made any allusion to Anne ’s engagement . XXII . “
66769	67005	67007	67008	Major Fenno	186	” The headline glared at Kate Clephane from the first page of the paper she had absently picked up from the table of her sitting - room . She and Anne , that morning , had journeyed back from Long Island in Hendrik Drover ’s motor , separated by his genial bulk , and shielded by it from the peril of private talk . On the day before -- that aching endless Sunday -- Anne , when with her mother , had steadily avoided the point at issue . She seemed too happy in their reunion to risk disturbing its first hours ; perhaps , Kate thought , she was counting on the spell of that reunion to break down her mother ’s opposition . But as they neared New York every mile brought them closer to the reality they were trying not to see ; and here it was at last , deriding the mother from those hideous headlines . She heard Anne ’s step behind her , and their glance crossed above the paragraph . A flush rose to the girl ’s cheek , while her eyes hesitatingly questioned her mother . The decisive moment in their struggle was at hand . Kate felt that everything depended on her holding fast to the line she had resolved to follow , and her voice sounded thin and small in the effort to steady it . “
67013	67014	67007	67008	Major Fenno	186	” “
67025	67029	67030	67030	He	186	” Anne wavered . “
67042	67067	67030	67030	He	186	” A hope leapt up in the mother ’s breast , then sank its ineffectual wings . She glanced back slowly at the newspaper . “
67076	67102	67073	67073	your	0	” The unwonted colour still burned in the girl ’s cheek . She made a motion of assent , and added , after another pause : “
67113	67114	67106	67107	Aunt Enid	145	” “
67120	67121	67117	67118	Major Fenno	186	” “
67124	67137	67117	67118	Major Fenno	186	” The silence prolonged itself . At length the mother brought out : “
67154	67162	67163	67163	I	0	” Anne looked at her almost timidly . “
67187	67272	67273	67273	I	0	” Kate Clephane turned away from her daughter ’s eyes . The look in them was too intolerably sweet to her . Anne was imploring her approval -- Anne could not bear to be happy without it . Yes ; but she wanted her other happiness also ; she wanted that more than anything else ; she would not hesitate to sacrifice her mother to it if there were no other way . All this rushed over Kate in a final flash of illumination . “
67278	67292	67273	67273	I	0	” Anne had said ; but she wanted Chris Fenno infinitely the more . “
67295	67322	67293	67293	Dear--	1188	” At her mother ’s first syllable Anne was at her side again , beseechingly . Kate Clephane lifted her hands to the girl ’s shoulders . “
67342	67461	67337	67337	I	0	” Her lips felt dry and stiff as she uttered her prevarication . But all her old arts of casuistry had come back ; what was the use of having practised them so long if they were not to serve her now ? She let herself yield to Anne ’s embrace . * * * * * That afternoon , as Mrs. Clephane sat alone upstairs , Fred Landers telephoned to ask if she would receive him . Anne was out , and her mother sent word that when Mr. Landers came he was to be shown up to her sitting - room . He entered it , presently , with outstretched hands and a smile of satisfaction . “
67487	67518	67519	67519	I	0	” Her hand fell lifelessly into his ; she could not answer . He drew up an armchair to the little autumnal fire , and continued to contemplate her approvingly . “
67542	67543	67538	67538	Anne	95	” “
67550	67551	67546	67547	Major Fenno	186	” “
67567	67574	67546	67547	Major Fenno	186	” His tone seemed to say : “
67590	67616	67546	67547	Major Fenno	186	” And again she found no answer . She was conscious that the gaze he still fixed on her had passed from benevolence to wistfulness . “
67625	67653	67654	67654	Anne	95	” His question made her tears rise ; but she was determined not to return upon the past . She had proved the uselessness of the attempt . “
67682	67683	67667	67667	You	1190	” “
67738	67750	67751	67751	You	1190	” He paused again , as if weighing his next words . “
67777	67778	67770	67770	I	0	” “
67783	67794	67770	67770	I	0	” His capacious forehead crimsoned with the effort to explain . “
67879	67940	67876	67876	You	1190	” She understood . What he was trying to say was that , on the whole , given the girl ’s self - will , and taking into account her ... well , her peculiar heredity ... taking into account , in fact , Kate Clephane herself ... the family had probably adopted the safest course in accepting the situation . “
68000	68121	68122	68122	You	0	” Kate Clephane sat listening in a state of acquiescent lassitude . She felt as if she had been given a drug which had left her intelligence clear but paralyzed her will . What was the use of arguing , discussing , opposing ? Later , of course , if everything else failed , Fred Landers was after all the person she would have to turn to , to whom her avowal would have to be made ; but for the moment he was of no more use to her than any of the others . The game she had resolved to play must be played between herself and Chris Fenno ; everything else was the vainest expenditure of breath . “
68132	68142	68122	68122	You	0	” she heard Landers rather nervously insisting ; and : “
68151	68155	68147	68147	you	0	” she assented . “
68199	68263	68273	68273	we	1198	” He stood up rather awkwardly , and she was aware of his advancing toward her . His face had grown long and solemn , and his broad bulk seemed to have narrowed to the proportions of the lank youth suffused with blushes who had taken shelter behind his mother when old Mrs. Landers had offered a bridal banquet to the John Clephanes . “
68303	68304	68273	68273	we	1198	” “
68306	68322	68273	68273	we	1198	” she faltered out , the clutch of pain relaxing a little about her heart . “
68327	68338	68273	68273	we	1198	” her visitor stammered , rubbing his hands together deprecatingly , “
68354	68383	68384	68384	You	0	” His nervous laugh tried to give the words a humorous turn , but his eyes were still grave . Kate rose and put her hand in his . “
68391	68411	68384	68384	You	0	” was all she found to say . Inwardly she was thinking , with a fresh thrill of anguish : “
68425	68452	68414	68414	I	0	” He had caught the note of dismissal in her voice , and was trying to gather up the scattered fragments of his self - possession . “
68573	68581	68567	68567	I	0	” he ended with his clumsy laugh . “
68592	68938	68939	68939	Mother	185	” Mrs. Clephane said simply . * * * * * The next evening , as she looked down the long dinner - table from her seat at its head , she was fantastically reminded of the first family dinner over which she had presided after her marriage . The background was the same ; the faces were the same , or so like that they seemed merely rejuvenated issues of the same coinage . Hendrik Drover sat in his brother - in - law ’s place ; but even that change was not marked enough to disturb the illusion . Hendrik Drover ’s heavy good - natured face belonged to the same type as John Clephane ’s ; one saw that the two had gone to the same schools and the same University , frequented the same clubs , fished the same salmon rivers ; Hendrik Drover might have been the ghost of John Clephane revisiting the scene of his earthly trials in a mood softened by celestial influences . And as for herself -- Kate Clephane -- if she had conformed to the plan of life prepared for her , instead of turning from it and denying it , might she not reasonably have hoped to reappear on the scene in the form of Enid Drover ? These grotesque fancies had begun to weave their spirals through her brain only after a first impact had emptied it of everything else , swept it suddenly clear of all meaning and all reason . That moment had come when Chris Fenno had entered in the wake of the other guests ; when she had heard his name announced like that of any other member of the family ; had seen him advance across the interminable length of the room , all the lights in it converging upon him as she felt that all the eyes in it converged on her ; when she had seen Anne at his side , felt her presence between them , heard the girl ’s voice , imperious , beseeching : “
68945	69061	68943	68943	Chris	88	” and felt her hand drop into that other hand with the awful plunge that the heart makes when a sudden shock flings it from its seat . She had lived through all that ; she and he had faced each other ; had exchanged greetings , she supposed ; had even , perhaps , said something to each other about Anne , and about their future relation . She did not know what ; she judged only , from the undisturbed faces about them , that there had been nothing alarming , nothing to scandalize or grieve ; that it had all , to the tribal eye , passed off decently and what they called “
69063	69085	68939	68939	Mother	185	” . Her past training had served her -- his boundless assurance had served him . It was what the French called “
69090	69150	68943	68943	Chris	88	” ; they had passed it . And in that mad world beyond the abyss , where she now found herself , here they all were with the old faces , saying the same old things with the same old complacency , eating their way through the same Clephane courses , expressing the same approval of the Clephane cellar ( “
69170	69314	69153	69153	Hendrik	159	” she caught Enid Drover breathing across the bubbles to her son - in - law ) . It was all , in short , as natural and unnatural , as horrible , intolerable and unescapable , as if she had become young again , with all her desolate and unavoidable life stretching away ahead of her to -- this . And , in the mad phantasmagoria , there was Chris himself , symbolizing what she had flown to in her wild escape ; representing , in some horrible duality , at once her sin and its harvest , her flight and her return . At the thought , her brain began to spin again , and she saw her own youth embodied before her in Anne , with Anne ’s uncompromising scorns and scruples , Anne ’s confident forward - looking gaze . “
69319	69332	69153	69153	Hendrik	159	” she heard Hendrik Drover say as they rose from the table , “
69355	69382	69383	69383	I	0	” while , at the other side of the table , Enid Drover , pink and melting from a last libation , sighed to Horace Maclew : “
69397	69448	69389	69389	John	96	” and Lilla , overhearing her , bracketed the observation in an ironic laugh . It had all gone off wonderfully ; thanks to Anne ’s tact the meeting between her mother and her betrothed had been thickly swaddled in layer on layer of non - conducting , non - explosive “
69450	69610	69611	69611	I	0	” . A sense of mutual congratulation was in the air as the groups formed themselves again in the drawing - room . The girl herself moved from one to another , pale , vigilant , radiant ; Chris Fenno , in a distant corner , was settled with coffee - cup and cigarette at Lilla Maclew ’s side ; Mrs. Clephane found herself barricaded behind Hendrik Drover and one of the older Tresseltons . They were the very two men , she remembered , between whom she had spent her evening after that first family dinner in which this one was so hallucinatingly merged . Not until the party was breaking up , and farewells filled the hall , did she suddenly find herself -- she knew not how -- isolated in the inner drawing - room with Chris Fenno . He stood there before her , and she seemed to hear his voice for the first time . “
69617	69632	69611	69611	I	0	” He appeared to feel it was a bad beginning , and tried again . “
69656	69676	69635	69635	I	0	” he asked . She faced him , erect and unflinching ; she dragged her eyes up to his . “
69714	70367	69706	69706	I	0	” she announced . It had been almost worth the agony she had bought it with to see the look in his eyes when he heard that . XXIII . Extreme exhaustion -- the sense of having reached the last limit of endurable emotion -- plunged Kate Clephane , that night , into a dreamless sleep . It was months and months since she had reached those nethermost levels below sound or image or any mental movement ; and she rose from them revived , renewed -- and then suddenly understood that they had been only a grief - drugged mockery . The return to reality was as painful as that of a traveller who has fallen asleep in the snow . One by one she had to readjust all her frozen faculties to the unchanged and intolerable situation ; and she felt weaker , less able to contend with it . The thought that that very day she might have to face Chris Fenno paralyzed her . He had asked to see her alone -- and she lay there , in the desolate dawn , rehearsing to herself all the cruel things he would find to say ; for his ways of being cruel were innumerable . The day before she had felt almost light - heartedly confident of being able to outface , to outlast him ; of her power of making the situation even more intolerable to him than he could make it to her . Now , in the merciless morning light , she had a new view of their respective situations . Who had suffered most the previous evening , he or she ? Whose wakening that morning was most oppressed by fears ? He had proposed to have a talk with her ; he had had the courage to do that ; and she felt that by having that courage he had already gained another point in their silent struggle . Slowly the days dragged by ; their hours were filled , for mother and daughter , by the crowding obligations and preoccupations natural to such times . Mrs. Clephane was helping her daughter with the wedding preparations ; a spectacle to charm and edify the rest of the family . Chris Fenno , two or three days after the announcement of the engagement , had returned to Baltimore , where he had accepted a temporary job on a newspaper , and where he had that , and other matters , to wind up before his marriage . During his stay in New York , Mrs. Clephane had had but two or three brief glimpses of him , and always in the presence of others . It was natural that he should wish to devote the greater part of his time to his betrothed . He and Anne went off in the early afternoon , and when they returned were , on each evening , engaged to dine with some member of the family . It was easy for Mrs. Clephane to excuse herself from these entertainments . The fact of her having presided at the dinner at which the engagement was announced had sealed it with her approval ; and at the little dinners organized by Nollie Tresselton and the other cousins her presence was hardly expected , and readily dispensed with . All this fitted in with the new times . The old days of introspections and explanations were over ; the era of taking things for granted was the only one that Anne ’s generation knew , and in that respect Anne was of her day . After the betrothal dinner she had said a tender goodnight to her mother , and the next evening , as she rushed up to dress after her long outing with Chris , had stopped at Kate ’s door to wave a loving hand and call out : “
70377	70688	70368	70368	He	1210	” That was all . Kate Clephane ’s own memories told her that to some natures happiness comes like a huge landslide burying all the past and spreading a fresh surface to life ’s sowings : and it was from herself , she reflected , that Anne had inherited her capacity for such all - obliterating bliss . The days passed , and Chris Fenno at length came back . He was staying with the Joe Tresseltons , and there was a constant coming and going of the young people between the two houses . Opportunities were not lacking to see Mrs. Clephane in private , and for the first days after his return she waited in numb terror for the inevitable , the incalculable moment . But it did not come ; and gradually she understood that it never would . His little speech had been a mere formula ; he had nothing to say to her ; no desire was farther from him than the wish to speak with her alone . What she had dreaded past expression , but supposed to be inevitable , he had probably never even seriously considered . Explanations ? What was the use of explanations ? He had gained his point ; the thing now was to live at peace with everybody . She saw that all her calculations had been mistaken . She had fancied that her tactics would render his situation intolerable ; that if only she could bear to spend a few weeks in his presence she would demonstrate to him the impossibility of his spending the rest of his life in hers . But his reasoning reached a good deal farther , and embraced certain essential elements in human nature that hers had left out . He had said to himself -- she was sure of it now-- : “
70708	70871	70872	70872	Dearest	716	” He had only to hold out till the wedding ; after that she would be a mere mother - in - law , and mothers - in - law are not a serious problem in modern life . How could she ever have imagined that he would not see through her game and out - manœuvre her , when he had done it so often before , and when his whole future depended on his doing it just once more ? She felt herself beaten at every point . Unless -- unless she told the truth to Anne . Every day was making that impossible thing more impossible ; yet every day was bringing them nearer to the day when not to do so -- if all other measures failed -- would be most impossible of all . She seemed to have reached that moment when , one morning , Anne came into her room and caught her by the hand . “
70884	70921	70874	70874	you’ve	716	” Kate , yielding to the girl ’s hand , was drawn along the corridor to her bedroom . There , on the bed , in a dazzle of whiteness , lay the wedding - dress . “
70931	71274	70923	70923	you	716	” Anne asked . * * * * * Kate Clephane rang the Rectory bell and found herself in the Rectory sitting - room . As she sat there , among photogravures of Botticelli Virgins and etchings of English cathedrals , she could not immediately remember why she had come , and looked with a kind of detached curiosity at the volumes of memoirs and sermons on the table at her elbow , at the perpendicular Gothic chairs against the wall , and the Morris armchairs which had superseded them . She had not been in a rectory sitting - room since the committee meeting at the Merrimans ’ , on the day when she had received Anne ’s cable . Her lapse of memory lasted only for a few seconds , but during that time she relived with intensity the sensations of that other day , she felt her happy heart dancing against the message folded under her dress , she saw the southern sun gilding the dull faces about the table , and smelt the violets and mimosa in Mrs. Merriman ’s vases . She woke again to the present just as an austere parlour - maid was requesting her to step this way . Dr. Arklow ’s study was full of books , of signed photographs of Church dignitaries , of more English cathedrals , of worn leather armchairs and scattered pipes and tobacco - pouches . The Rector himself , on the hearth , loomed before her at once bland and formidable . He had guessed , of course , that she had come to talk about the date and hour of the wedding , and all the formulas incidental to such visits fell from his large benevolent lips . The visit really passed off more easily than she had expected , and she was on her feet again and feeling him behind her like a gentle trade - wind accustomed to waft a succession of visitors to the door , when she stopped abruptly and faced him . “
71277	71282	70923	70923	you	716	” He waited benevolently . “
71299	71300	71301	71303	Dear Mrs. Clephane	187	” “
71310	71331	71301	71303	Dear Mrs. Clephane	187	” He was waving her back into her armchair ; but she stood before him , unconscious of the gesture . “
71339	71340	71335	71338	a friend of mine--	1214	” “
71350	71363	71346	71346	Do	229	” She sat down , still unaware of her movements or his . “
71392	71403	71382	71382	She	1216	” He bowed expectantly . Her parched lips brought out : “
71410	71429	71382	71382	She	1216	” and his gesture replied that communications , in that room , were always held to be so . “
71434	71438	71441	71442	My friend	1217	” he added . “
71451	71469	71470	71470	She	1216	” She stopped , her voice failing her ; then the words came forth in panting jerks . “
71543	71544	71549	71551	The same man	1221	” “
71554	71623	71549	71551	The same man	1221	” The Rector ’s voice swelled above her like a wave ; his presence towered , blurred and gigantic . She felt the tears in her throat ; but again she was seized by the besetting desire that her secret should not be guessed , and a desperate effort at self - control drove the tears back and cleared her voice . Dr. Arklow still loomed and brooded . “
71627	71656	71657	71657	He	1218	” A slow flush of agony rose to her forehead ; but she remembered that she was seated with her back to the light , and took courage . “
71663	71672	71659	71659	he	1218	” She paused , and then went on : “
71703	71704	71700	71700	he	1218	” “
71707	71708	71700	71700	he	1218	” “
71742	71743	71733	71733	she	562	” “
71749	71807	71733	71733	she	562	” Her voice failed her again , and she signed her assent . There was another long pause . She sat motionless , looking down at her own interlocked hands . She felt that Dr. Arklow was uneasily pacing the hearth - rug ; at last she was aware that he was once more standing before her . “
71821	71825	71818	71818	she	1227	” She started . “
71830	71831	71818	71818	she	1227	” “
71839	71840	71818	71818	she	1227	” “
71850	71855	71845	71845	she	1227	” Kate cried precipitately . “
71865	71866	71867	71867	I	0	” “
71870	71884	71867	71867	I	0	” She thought she caught a faint note of relief in his voice . “
71892	71893	71885	71885	She	1227	” “
71896	71897	71885	71885	She	1227	” “
71914	71915	71899	71899	she	1227	” “
71922	71923	71899	71899	she	1227	” “
71930	71949	71952	71952	her	1227	” She made another sign of assent . Dr. Arklow cleared his throat , and declared with emphasis : “
71959	71960	71952	71952	her	1227	” “
71963	71982	71952	71952	her	1227	” Kate Clephane faltered . She got to her feet and looked about her blindly for the door . “
71989	71997	71983	71983	She	1227	” the Rector repeated with rising vehemence . “
72011	72012	71983	71983	She	1227	” “
72015	72033	71983	71983	She	1227	” she repeated . She was on the threshold now ; automatically she held out her hand . “
72036	72047	72048	72048	she	1227	” the Rector continued uncertainly , his eyes upon her , “
72071	72077	72061	72061	she	1227	” There was a pause . “
72090	72098	72061	72061	she	1227	” he went on , gaining firmness , “
72180	72205	72172	72172	I	0	” He stood leaning against the jamb of the door ; her hand was on the doorknob , and she listened with lowered head . “
72220	72227	72228	72228	I	0	” he said after a moment . “
72241	72279	72228	72228	I	0	” She lifted her eyes with an effort , and saw in his face the same look of understanding she had caught there for a moment while she talked with him at the Drovers ’ after dinner . “
72282	72359	72228	72228	I	0	” she murmured . She had crossed the threshold now ; she felt that he was holding out his hand . His face once more wore the expression of worldly benevolence that was as much the badge of his profession as his dress . After all , she perceived , he was glad that she had said nothing more definite , glad that their talk was safely over . Yet she had caught that other look . “
72384	72385	72388	72388	she	1228	” “
72399	72403	72393	72393	she	1228	” Kate repeated . “
72407	72417	72419	72419	I	0	” Again she caught the relief in his voice . “
72431	72452	72419	72419	I	0	” She was aware that they were shaking hands , and that he was averting his apprehensive eyes from hers . “
72458	72466	72419	72419	I	0	” the eyes seemed to entreat her , “
72486	72499	72468	72468	’s	1244	” At the front door he bowed her out , repeating cordially : “
72526	72757	72519	72519	I	0	” The door closed , and she found herself in the street . XXIV . She turned away from the Rectory and walked aimlessly up Madison Avenue . It was a warm summer - coloured October day . At Fifty - ninth Street she turned into the Park and wandered on over the yellowing leaf - drifts of the ramble . In just such a state of blind bewilderment she had followed those paths on the day when she had first caught sight of Chris Fenno and Lilla Gates in the twilight ahead of her . That was less than a year ago , and she looked back with amazement at the effect which that chance encounter had had on her . She seemed hardly to be suffering more now than she had suffered then . It had seemed unbearable , impossible , at the moment , that Chris Fenno should enter , even so episodically , so remotely , into her new life ; and here he was , ensconced in its very centre , in complete possession of it . She tried to think the situation out ; but , as always , her trembling thoughts recoiled , just as she had seen Dr. Arklow ’s recoil . Every one to whom she had tried to communicate her secret without betraying it had had the same instantaneous revulsion . “
72766	72820	72821	72822	The daughter	2467	” their averted eyes , their shrinking voices seemed to say . It was too horrible for any ears . How then was she to obey Dr. Arklow ’s bidding and impart the secret to Anne ? He had said it as positively as if he were handing down a commandment from Sinai : “
72827	72841	72842	72843	The daughter	2467	” How easy to lay down abstract rules for other people ’s guidance : “
72844	72886	72887	72887	You--_you	1247	” was just an imaginary person -- a convenient conversational pawn . But Kate Clephane ’s daughter -- her own Anne ! She closed her eyes and tried to face the look in Anne ’s as the truth dawned on her . “
72919	72940	72942	72942	You	1247	” Yes -- perhaps that would be the worst of it , the way Anne would look at her and say “
72945	73046	72942	72942	You	1247	” For , once the girl knew the truth , her healthy youth might so revolt from Chris ’s baseness , Chris ’s duplicity , that the shock of the discovery would be its own cure . But when the blow had fallen , when Anne ’s life had crashed about her , and the ruins been cleared away -- what then of her mother ? Why , her mother would be buried under those ruins ; her life would be over ; but a hideous indestructible image of her would remain , overshadowing , darkening the daughter ’s future . “
73055	74863	74864	74864	You	1252	” No ; Kate Clephane could go no farther than that . Such confessions were not to be made ; were not for a daughter ’s ears . She began the phrase to herself again and again , but could not end it .... And , after all , she suddenly thought , Dr. Arklow himself , having given the injunction , had at once qualified , had virtually withdrawn it . In declaring that such an abomination must at all costs be prevented he had spoken with the firmness of a priest ; but almost at once the man had intervened , and had suggested to the hypothetical mother the alternative of not speaking at all , if only she could be sure of never betraying herself in the future , of sacrificing everything to the supreme object of avoiding what he called sterile pain . Those tentative , half - apologetic words now effaced the others in Kate ’s mind . Though spoken with the accent of authority -- and almost under his breath -- she knew they represented what he really felt . But where should she find the courage to conform to them ? She had left the Park , aimlessly , unseeingly , and was walking eastward through a half - built street in the upper Nineties . The thought of returning home -- re - entering that house where the white dress still lay on the bed -- was unbearable . She walked on and on .... Suddenly she came upon an ugly sandstone church - front with a cross above the doorway . The leathern swing - doors were flapping back and forth , women passing in and out . Kate Clephane pushed open one of the doors and looked in . The day was fading , and in the dusky interior lights fluttered like butterflies about the paper flowers of the altar . There was no service , but praying figures were scattered here and there . Against the brown - washed walls of the aisles she observed a row of confessionals of varnished wood , like cigar - boxes set on end ; before one or two , women were expectantly kneeling . Mrs. Clephane wondered what they had to tell . Leaning against one of the piers of the nave she evoked all those imaginary confessions , and thought how trivial , how childish they would seem , compared to what she carried in her breast .... What a help it must be to turn to somebody who could tell one firmly , positively what to do -- to be able to lay down one ’s moral torture like a heavy load at the end of the day ! Dr. Arklow had none of the authority which the habit of the confessional must give . He could only vaguely sympathize and deplore , and try to shuffle the horror out of sight as soon as he caught an unwilling glimpse of it . But these men whose office it was to bind and to unbind -- who spoke as the mere impersonal mouth - pieces of a mighty Arbitrator , letting neither moral repugnance nor false delicacy interfere with the sacred task of alleviation and purification -- how different must they be ! Her eyes filled at the thought of laying her burden in such hands . And why not ? Why not entrust her anonymous secret to one of those anonymous ears ? In talking to Dr. Arklow she had felt that both he and she were paralyzed by the personal relation , and all the embarrassments and complications arising from it . When she spoke of her friend in distress , and he replied with the same evasive formula , both were conscious of the evasion , and hampered by it . And so it had been from the first -- there was not an ear into which she dared pour her agony . What if , now , at once , she were to join those unknown penitents ? It was possible , she knew -- she had but a step to take .... She did not take it . Her unrest drove her forth again into the darkening street , drove her homeward with uncertain steps , in the mood of forlorn expectancy of those who , having failed to exert their will , wait helplessly on the unforeseen . After all , how could one tell ? Chris must , in his own degree , be suffering as she was suffering . Why not stick to her old plan of waiting , holding on , enduring everything , in the hope of wearing him out ? She reached the door of her house , set her teeth , and went in . Overhead , she remembered with a shudder , the white dress waited , with all that it implied .... The drawing - room was empty , and she went up to her own room . There , as usual , the fire shone invitingly , fresh flowers opened in the lamplight . All was warmth , peace , intimacy . As she sat down by the fireside she seemed to see Fred Landers ’s heavy figure in the opposite armchair , his sturdy square - toed boots turned to the hearth . She remembered how , one day , as he sat there , she had said to herself that it might be pleasant to see him there always . Now , in the extremity of her loneliness , the thought returned . Since then he had confessed his own hope to her -- shyly , obliquely , apologetically ; but under his stammering words she had recognized the echo of a long desire . She knew he had always loved her ; had not Anne betrayed that it was her guardian who had persuaded her to recall her unknown mother ? Kate Clephane owed him everything , then -- all her happiness and all her sorrow ! He knew everything of her life -- or nearly everything . To whom else could she turn with the peculiar sense of security which that certitude gave ? She felt sorry that she had received his tentative advance so coldly , so inarticulately . After all , he might yet be her refuge -- her escape . She closed her eyes , and tried to imagine what life would be -- years and years of it -- at Fred Landers ’s side . To feel the nearness of that rugged patient kindness ; would it not lighten her misery , make the thoughts and images that were torturing her less palpable , less acute , less real ? She sat there for a long time , brooding . Now and then a step passing her door , or a burst of voices on the landing , told her that Anne was probably receiving some of her friends in her own rooms at the other end of the passage . The wedding presents were already arriving ; Anne , with a childish pleasure that was unlike her usual aloofness from material things , had set them out on a long table in her sitting - room . The mother pictured the eager group inspecting and admiring , the talk of future plans , the discussion of all the details of the wedding . The date for it would soon be fixed ; ostensibly , her own visit to Dr. Arklow had been made for the purpose . But at the last moment her courage had failed her , and she had said vaguely , in leaving , that she would let him know . As she sat there , she saw her daughter ’s pale illuminated face as though it were before her . Anne ’s happiness shone through her , making her opaque and guarded features luminous and transparent ; and the mother could measure , from her own experience , the amount of heat and force that fed that incandescence . She herself had always had a terrible way of being happy -- and that way was Anne ’s . She simply could not bear to picture to herself the change , in Anne ’s face , from ecstasy to anguish . She had seen that change once , and the sight had burned itself into her eye - balls . To destroy Anne ’s happiness seemed an act of murderous cruelty . What did it matter -- as the chances of life went -- of what elements such happiness was made ? Had she , Kate Clephane , ever shrunk from her own bliss because of the hidden risks it contained ? She had played high , staked everything -- and lost . Could she blame her daughter for choosing to take the same risks ? No ; there was , in all great happiness , or the illusion momentarily passing for it , a quality so beatific , so supernatural , that no pain with which it might have to be paid could , at the time , seem too dear ; could hardly , perhaps , ever seem so , to headlong hearts like hers and Anne ’s . Her own heart had begun to tremble and dilate with her new resolve ; the resolve to accept the idea of Anne ’s marriage , to cease her inward struggle against it , and try to be in reality what she was already pretending to be : the acquiescent , approving mother .... After all , why not ? Legally , technically , there was nothing wrong , nothing socially punishable , in the case . And what was there on the higher , the more private grounds where she pretended to take her stand and deliver her judgment ? Chris Fenno was a young man -- she was old enough to be , if not his mother , at least his mother - in - law . What had she ever hoped or expected to be to him but a passing incident , a pleasant memory ? From the first , she had pitched their relation in that key ; had insisted on the difference in their ages , on her own sense of the necessary transiency of the tie , on the fact that she would not have it otherwise . Anything rather than to be the old woman clutching at an impossible prolongation of bliss -- anything rather than be remembered as a burden instead of being regretted as a delight ! How often had she told him that she wanted to remain with him like the memory of a flowering branch brushed by at night ? “
74889	74993	74879	74879	you’ll	1252	” Vanishing and sweet -- that was what she had meant to be ! And she had kept to her resolution till the blow fell-- Well , and was he so much to blame for its falling ? She herself had been the witness of his resistance , of his loyal efforts to escape . The vehemence of Anne ’s passion had thwarted him , had baffled them both ; if he loved her as passionately as she loved him , was he not justified in accepting the happiness forced upon him ? And how refuse it without destroying the girl ’s life ? “
75012	75055	75010	75010	Anne	95	” the mother cried . She seemed at last to have reached a clearer height , a more breathable air . Renunciation -- renunciation . If she could attain to that , what real obstacle was there to her daughter ’s happiness ? “
75069	75089	75056	75056	I	0	” she reflected . The sound of steps and voices outside had ceased . From the landing had come a “
75094	75661	75056	75056	I	0	” in Nollie Tresselton ’s voice ; no doubt she had been the last visitor to leave , and Anne was now alone ; perhaps alone with her betrothed . Well ; to that thought also Kate Clephane must accustom herself ; by and bye they would be always alone , those two , in the sense of being nearer to each other than either of them was to any one else . The mother could bear that too . Not to lose Anne -- at all costs to keep her hold on the girl ’s confidence and tenderness : that was all that really mattered . She would go to Anne now . She herself would ask the girl to fix the date for the wedding . She got up and walked along the deep - piled carpet of the corridor . The door of Anne ’s sitting - room was ajar , but no sound came from within . Every one was gone , then ; even Chris Fenno . With a breath of relief the mother pushed the door open . The room was empty . One of the tall vases was full of branching chrysanthemums and autumn berries . In a corner stood a tea - table with scattered cups and plates . The Airedale drowsed by the hearth . As she stood there , Kate Clephane saw the little Anne who used to sit by that same fire trying to coax the red birds through the fender . The vision melted the last spot of resistance in her heart . The door of Anne ’s bedroom was also ajar , but no sound came from there either . Perhaps the girl had gone out with her last visitors , escaping for a starlit rush up the Riverside Drive before dinner . These sudden sallies at queer hours were a way the young people had . The mother listened a moment longer , then laid her hand on the bedroom door . Before her , directly in the line of her vision , was Anne ’s narrow bed . On it the wedding - dress still lay , in a dazzle of whiteness ; and between Mrs. Clephane and the bed , looking also at the dress , stood Anne and Chris Fenno . They had not heard her cross the sitting - room or push open the bedroom door ; they did not hear her now . All their faculties were absorbed in each other . The young man ’s arms were around the girl , her cheek was against his . One of his hands reached about her shoulder and , making a cup for her chin , pressed her face closer . They were looking at the dress ; but the curves of their lips , hardly detached , were like those of a fruit that has burst apart of its own ripeness . Kate Clephane stood behind them like a ghost . It made her feel like a ghost to be so invisible and inaudible . Then a furious flame of life rushed through her ; in every cell of her body she felt that same embrace , felt the very texture of her lover ’s cheek against her own , burned with the heat of his palm as it clasped Anne ’s chin to press her closer . “
75673	76210	75056	75056	I	0	” Mrs. Clephane imagined she had shrieked it out at them , and pressed her hands to her mouth to stifle the cry ; then she became aware that it was only a dumb whisper within her . For a time which seemed without end she continued to stand there , invisible , inaudible , and they remained in each other ’s embrace , motionless , speechless . Then she turned and went . They did not hear her . A dark fermentation boiled up into her brain ; every thought and feeling was clogged with thick entangling memories .... Jealous ? Was she jealous of her daughter ? Was she physically jealous ? Was that the real secret of her repugnance , her instinctive revulsion ? Was that why she had felt from the first as if some incestuous horror hung between them ? She did not know -- it was impossible to analyze her anguish . She knew only that she must fly from it , fly as far as she could from the setting of these last indelible impressions . How had she ever imagined that she could keep her place at Anne ’s side -- that she could either outstay Chris , or continue to live under the same roof with them ? Both projects seemed to her , now , equally nebulous and impossible . She must put the world between them -- the whole width of the world was not enough . The very grave , she thought , would be hardly black enough to blot out that scene . She found herself , she hardly knew how , at the foot of the stairs , in the front hall . Her precipitate descent recalled the early winter morning when , as hastily , almost as unconsciously , she had descended those same stairs , flying from her husband ’s house . Nothing was changed in the hall : her eyes , once again morbidly receptive of details , noted on the door the same patent locks with which her fingers had then struggled . Now , as then , a man ’s hat and stick lay on the hall table ; on that other day they had been John Clephane ’s , now they were Chris Fenno ’s . That was the only difference . She stood there , looking about her , wondering why she did not push back the bolts and rush out into the night , hatless and cloakless as she was . What else was there to do but to go straight to the river , or to some tram line with its mortal headlights bearing straight down on one ? One did n’t have to have a hat and cloak to go out in search of annihilation .... As she stood there the door - bell rang , and she heard the step of a servant coming to open the door . She shrank back into the drawing - room , and in another moment Enid Drover had rustled in , her pink cheeks varnished with the cold , her furs full of the autumn freshness . Her little eyes were sharp with excitement . “
76350	76361	76339	76339	I	0	” On the doorstep Mrs. Drover turned to call back : “
76370	76515	76364	76364	Hendrik	159	” Her limousine engulfed her . XXV . Mrs. Clephane excused herself from coming down to dinner ; Aline was to say that she was very tired , and begged that no one should disturb her . The next morning , she knew , Chris was returning to Baltimore . Perhaps in his absence she would be able to breathe more freely , see more clearly . Anne , as usual , respected her mother ’s wishes ; she neither came up nor sent to enquire . But the next morning , in the old way , fresh and shining , she appeared with Mrs. Clephane ’s breakfast - tray . She wanted to be reassured as to her mother ’s health , and Kate , under her solicitous eye , poured out a cup of tea and forced down a bit of toast . “
76527	76528	76532	76532	dear	1521	” “
76534	76535	76532	76532	dear	1521	” “
76554	76562	76542	76543	Aunt Enid	145	” Anne spoke the least little reproachfully . “
76588	76589	76590	76591	Uncle Hendrik	151	” “
76610	76620	76584	76584	she	145	” The girl paused and looked at her mother . “
76634	76635	76584	76584	she	145	” “
76638	76639	76584	76584	she	145	” “
76662	76663	76652	76652	It	1266	” “
76668	76669	76652	76652	It	1266	” “
76678	76679	76676	76676	you	1258	” “
76690	76722	76686	76686	I	0	” The words escaped before Mrs. Clephane could repress them . Her heart began to rush about in her like a caged animal . Anne ’s brows darkened and drew together . “
76734	76735	76737	76737	I	0	” “
76754	76764	76744	76744	I	0	” Mrs. Clephane murmured , forcing a thin smile . “
76785	76799	76774	76774	You	1258	” Mrs. Clephane pushed the tray away and propped herself on her elbow . “
76808	76809	76811	76811	you	1258	” “
76829	76839	76840	76840	I	0	” The girl ’s lip was beginning to tremble . “
76849	76850	76845	76845	I	0	” “
76875	76876	76869	76869	you	1258	” “
76890	76900	76884	76884	mother	1508	” Anne hesitated , and then ventured , timidly : “
76910	76911	76901	76901	You	1258	” “
76935	76949	76952	76952	my	0	” Anne stood up and looked down on her with searching imperious eyes . “
76963	76964	76952	76952	my	0	” “
76975	76984	76969	76969	us	1272	” The girl continued to scrutinize her strangely . “
76995	77002	76989	76989	you	1258	” Mrs. Clephane did not speak . “
77017	77074	77009	77009	I	0	” Anne exclaimed in a shaking voice . At the sound of that break in her voice the dread of seeing her suffer once more superseded every other feeling in the mother ’s breast . She leaned against the pillows , speechless for a moment ; then she held out her hand , seeking Anne ’s . “
77087	77088	77089	77089	You	1258	” “
77102	77108	77097	77097	You	1258	” Slowly Kate Clephane articulated : “
77115	77116	77109	77109	I	0	” “
77155	77229	77151	77151	I	0	” Mrs. Clephane , under her daughter ’s relentless eyes , felt the blood rising from her throat to her pale lips and drawn cheeks , and to the forehead in which her pulses must be visibly beating . She lay there , bathed in a self - accusing crimson , and it seemed to her that those clear young eyes were like steel blades plunging into the deepest folds of her conscience . “
77259	77398	77400	77400	Anne	95	” The girl shrilled it out suddenly , and hid her face in her hands . Kate Clephane lay without speaking . In the first shock of the outcry all her defences had crashed together about her head , and it had been almost a relief to feel them going , to feel that pretences and disguises were at an end . Then Anne ’s hands dropped to her side , and the mother , meeting her gaze , lost the sense of her own plight in the sight of that other woe . All at once she felt herself strong and resolute ; all the old forces of dissimulation were pouring back through her veins . The accusing red faded from her face , and she lay there and quietly met the question in Anne ’s eyes . “
77403	77413	77400	77400	Anne	95	” she simply said , with a little shrug . “
77428	77467	77471	77471	dear	1521	” Anne was on her knees at the bedside , her face buried in the coverlet . It was easier to speak to her while her eyes were hidden , and Kate laid a hand on her hair . “
77479	77491	77471	77471	dear	1521	” She heard the note of magnanimity in her own voice . “
77500	77501	77494	77494	you	1508	” “
77512	77513	77507	77507	I	0	” “
77543	77590	77536	77536	you	1508	” Kate Clephane lay against her pillows and meditated . Her hand was still in Anne ’s hair ; she held the girl ’s head gently against the coverlet , still not wishing her own face to be too closely scrutinized . At length she spoke . “
77608	77618	77619	77619	I	0	” She paused , and rallied her failing courage . “
77640	77661	77662	77663	Fred Landers	94	” The first words were the most difficult to say ; after that she heard her voice going on steadily . “
77740	77898	77899	77900	Poor Fred	231	” After Anne had left her , subdued but jubilant , she lay there and remembered , with a twinge of humiliation , that the night before she had hurried downstairs in a mad rush to death . Anything -- anything to escape from the coil of horror closing in on her ! ... And it had sufficed to her to meet Enid Drover in the hall , with that silly chatter about the house next door , to check the impulse , drive her back into the life she was flying from .... She reflected with self - derision that all her suicidal impulses seemed to end in the same way ; by landing her in the arms of some man she did n’t care for . Then she remembered Anne ’s illuminated face , and lay listening to the renewed life of the house , the bustle of happy preparations going on all about her . “
77910	78274	77899	77900	Poor Fred	231	” she thought . What she herself wanted , all she now wanted , was never again to see that dreadful question in Anne ’s eyes . And she had found no other way of evading it . XXVI . Now that a day for the wedding was fixed , the preparations went on more rapidly . Soon there was only a fortnight left ; then only ten days ; then a week . Chris Fenno ’s parents were to have come to New York to make the acquaintance of their son ’s betrothed ; but though a date had several times been appointed for their visit , Mrs. Fenno , whose health was not good , had never been well enough to come , and finally it was arranged that Anne should go to Baltimore to see them . She was to stay with the Maclews , who immediately seized the opportunity to organize a series of festivities in celebration of the event . Lilla invited Mrs. Clephane to come with her daughter ; but Kate declined , on the plea that she herself was not well . People were beginning to notice how tired and thin she looked . Her glass showed streaks of gray in her redundant hair , and about her lips and eyes the little lines she had so long kept at bay . Everybody in the family agreed that it would be a good thing for her to have a few days ’ rest before the wedding . With regard to her own future she had sworn Anne to unconditional secrecy . She explained that she did not intend to give Fred Landers a definite answer till after the wedding , and Anne , who had all the Clephane reticence , understood her wish to keep the matter quiet , and even in her guardian ’s presence was careful not to betray that she knew of his hopes . She only made him feel that he was more than ever welcome , and touched him by showing an added cordiality at a moment when most girls are deaf and blind to all human concerns but their own . “
78302	78327	78290	78290	she	95	” He said it with a gentle complacency as he sat in Mrs. Clephane ’s sitting - room one evening during Anne ’s absence . “
78337	78442	78335	78335	you	1288	” he added , looking at Kate Clephane with shy beseeching eyes . She smiled back at him , wondering if she would ever have the courage to tell him that she meant to marry him . He was thinking of that too , she knew . Why not tell him now , at once ? She had only to lean forward and lay her hand on his . No words would be necessary . And surely she would feel less alone .... But she remained silent ; it was easier to think of speaking than to speak . It was he who questioned : “
78456	78462	78529	78529	she	95	” She continued to smile . “
78471	78472	78473	78473	Anne	95	” “
78486	78487	78473	78473	Anne	95	” “
78498	78513	78529	78529	she	95	” He coloured as if she had caught him in a failure of tact . “
78537	78564	78529	78529	she	95	” Again she perceived that he was trying to remind her of a possible alternative , and again she let the allusion drop , answering merely : “
78581	78582	78578	78578	people	256	” “
78591	78601	78588	78588	you	1288	” He seldom risked anything as direct as that . “
78628	78640	78618	78618	You	1288	” She rose impatiently and went to lean against the mantelpiece . “
78665	78666	78661	78661	I’ve	0	” “
78675	78676	78661	78661	I’ve	0	” “
78687	78700	78661	78661	I’ve	0	” She hardly knew how she brought the word from her lips . “
78714	78715	78708	78708	her	95	” “
78753	78903	78748	78748	I	0	” She turned and looked at herself in the glass above the mantel , seeing the gray streaks and the accusing crows’-feet . And as she stood there , she remembered how once , when she was standing in the same way before a mirror , Chris had come up behind her , and they had laughed at seeing their reflections kiss . How young she had been then -- how young ! Now , as she looked at herself , she saw behind her the reflection of Fred Landers ’s comfortable bulk , sunk in an armchair in after - dinner repose , his shirt - front bulging a little , the lamplight varnishing the top of his head through the thinning hair . A middle - aged couple -- perfectly suited to each other in age and appearance . She turned back and sat down beside him . “
78910	78982	78983	78983	I	0	” she said . He accepted with a wistful alacrity which seemed to say it was the most he hoped for , and they drew up a table and sat down opposite each other , calmly disposing the little cards in elaborate patterns . They had been playing for about half an hour when she rumpled up the cards abruptly , and sweeping them together into a passionate heap cried out : “
79009	79038	78999	78999	I	0	” She dropped her face into her hands , and sat there propping her elbows on the card - table , and laughing out between her intercrossed fingers : “
79047	79333	79044	79044	you	1296	” XXVII . Only three days more now ; for just three days more she and Anne would live under one roof . And then ? The interrogation was not Anne ’s . The news of Mrs. Clephane ’s intended marriage had completely restored the girl ’s serenity . Chris Fenno , detained in Baltimore by his mother ’s sudden and somewhat alarming illness , had not yet reappeared ; it seemed likely now that he would arrive in New York only the day before the wedding . Anne was to have her mother to herself to the last ; and with every art of tenderness and dependence she tried to show her appreciation of these final days , sweet with the sweetness of dear things ending , yet without pain because they were not to precede a real separation . Her only anxiety -- the alarm about Mrs. Fenno -- had been allayed by a reassuring telegram , and she moved within that rainbow bubble that once or twice in life contrives to pass itself off as the real horizon . The sight of her , Kate Clephane reasoned , ought to have been justification enough . Anything was worth doing or sacrificing to keep the bubble unbroken . And the last three days would pass -- the Day itself would pass . The world , after it was over , would go on in the same old way . What was all the flurry about ? Mrs. Drover did not find it easy to maintain so detached an attitude . She , for one , could not conceive how her sister - in - law could remain so calm at such a moment . “
79418	79419	79399	79400	no one	750	” “
79424	79430	79399	79400	no one	750	” Mrs. Clephane echoed blankly . “
79449	79462	79466	79466	Hendrik	151	” Enid Drover chirped with one of her rare attempts at irony . “
79488	79489	79466	79466	Hendrik	151	” “
79494	79495	79466	79466	Hendrik	151	” “
79504	79596	79498	79498	you	1298	” Mrs. Drover ’s little laugh had a tinge of condescension . Though all the family had conspired to make Mrs. Clephane forget that she had lived for nearly twenty years outside the social pale , the fact remained ; she _ had _ . And it was on just such occasions as this that she betrayed it , somewhat embarrassingly to her sister - in - law . Not even to know that , when a bride ’s father was dead , it was her mother who gave her away ! “
79606	79639	79640	79640	Hendrik	151	” Mrs. Drover rippled on , half compassionate , half contemptuous . It was hard to understand how some people contrived to remain in ignorance of the most elementary rules of behaviour ! “
79649	79670	79647	79647	he	151	” Kate Clephane said . Anne was passing through the room , a pile of belated presents in her arms . “
79687	79714	79680	79680	Hendrik	151	” Mrs. Drover ’s little eyes grew sharp with the vision of Hendrik ’s broad back and glossy collar playing the leading part in the ceremony . “
79729	79737	79724	79726	Mr. Hendrik Drover	159	” It really would read very well . “
79742	79748	79724	79726	Mr. Hendrik Drover	159	” Anne paused to question . “
79765	79766	79770	79770	mother	1508	” “
79772	79799	79770	79770	mother	1508	” Kate Clephane caught the instant drop in the girl ’s voice . Underneath her radiant security , what suspicion , what dread , still lingered ? “
79816	79817	79807	79807	I	0	” “
79826	79827	79820	79820	you	1298	” “
79834	79846	79854	79854	mother	1508	” Their thin - edged smiles seemed to cross like blades . “
79856	79857	79854	79854	mother	1508	” “
79863	79881	79854	79854	mother	1508	” Mrs. Drover heaved a faintly disappointed sigh . Hendrik would certainly have looked the part better . “
79890	79909	79854	79854	mother	1508	” she said , in the tone of one who strikes one more item off an invisible list . “
79926	79936	79939	79940	Uncle Fred	94	” Anne and her mother were still exchanging smiles . “
79948	79952	79946	79946	he	94	” Anne cried . “
79966	79977	79978	79978	Fred	94	” Mrs. Clephane brushed aside the possible cousin from Meridia . “
79984	79997	79978	79978	Fred	94	” she declared ; and Anne ’s smile lost its nervous edge . “
80008	80022	79978	79978	Fred	94	” the girl gaily challenged her aunt ; and Mrs. Drover groaned back : “
80064	80464	80468	80468	I	0	” * * * * * The time had almost come : the sun had risen on the day before the wedding . It rose , mounted up in a serene heaven , bent its golden arch over an untroubled indifferent world , and stooped westward in splendid unawareness . The day , so full of outward bustle , of bell - ringing , telephone calls , rushings back and forth of friends , satellites and servants , had drooped to its close in the unnatural emptiness of such conclusions . Everything was done ; every question was settled ; every last order given ; and Anne , with a kiss for her mother , had gone off with Nollie and Joe Tresselton for one of the crepuscular motor - dashes that clear the cobwebs from modern brains . Anne had resolutely refused to have either bridesmaids or the conventional family dinner of the bridal eve . She wanted to strip the occasion of all its meaningless formalities , and Chris Fenno was of the same mind . He was to spend the evening alone with his parents at their hotel , and Anne had invited no one but Fred Landers to dine . She had warned her mother that she might be a little late in getting home , and had asked her , in view of Mr. Landers ’s excessive punctuality , to be downstairs in time to receive and pacify him . Mrs. Clephane had seen through the simple manœuvre , and had not resented it . After all , it would be the best opportunity to tell Fred Landers what she had decided to tell him . As she sat by the drawing - room fire listening for the door - bell she felt a curious sense of aloofness , almost of pacification . It might be only the quiet of exhaustion ; she half - suspected it was , but she was too exhausted to feel sure . Yet one thing was clear to her ; she had suffered less savagely since she had known that Dr. Arklow had guessed what she was suffering . The problem had been almost too difficult for him ; but it was enough that he had perceived its difficulty , had seen that it was too deeply rooted in living fibres to be torn out without mortal hurt . “
80482	80545	80547	80547	I	0	” That phrase of his helped her even now ; her mind clung fast to it as she sat waiting for Landers ’s ring . It came punctually , even sooner than the hour , as Anne had foreseen ; and in another moment he was advancing across the room in his slow bulky way , with excuses for his early arrival . “
80560	80561	80562	80562	Anne	95	” “
80569	80570	80571	80571	I	0	” “
80591	80617	80586	80586	you	95	” he continued , letting himself down into an armchair as if he were lowering a bale of goods over the side of a ship . “
80630	80906	80626	80628	the punctual generation	1321	” She winced a little at being so definitely relegated to the rank where she belonged . Yes : he and she were nearly of an age . She remembered , in her newly - married precocity , thinking of him as a shy shambling boy , years younger than herself . Now he had the deliberate movements of the elderly , and though he shot , fished , played golf , and kept up the activities common to his age , his mind , in maturing , had grown heavier , and seemed to have communicated its prudent motions to his body . She shut her eyes for a second from the vision . Her own body still seemed so supple , free and imponderable . If it had not been for her looking - glass she would never have known she was more than twenty . She glanced up at the clock ; a quarter to eight . Very likely Anne would not be back for another half hour . How would the evening ever drag itself to an end ? They exchanged a few words about the wedding , but the topic was intolerable to Mrs. Clephane . She had managed to face the situation as a whole : to consider its details was still beyond her . Yet if she left that subject , just beyond it lay the question her companion was waiting to ask ; and that alternative was intolerable too . She got up from her seat , moved aimlessly across the room , straightened a flower in a vase , put out a superfluous wall - light . “
80916	80926	80626	80628	the punctual generation	1321	” she said , coming back to her seat . “
80930	80941	80946	80946	yours	1323	” He threw all his unspoken worship into the word . “
80948	80949	80950	80950	My	0	” “
80956	81043	80950	80950	My	0	” Her hands went up to the rich mass as if she would have liked to tear it from her head . At that moment she hated it , as she did everything else that mocked her with the barren illusion of youth . Fred Landers had coloured to the edge of his own thin hair ; no doubt he was afraid of her resenting even this expression of admiration . His embarrassment irritated yet touched her , and raising her eyes she looked into his . “
81064	81093	81056	81056	I	0	” she said . He was evidently unprepared for this , and did not know whether to be distressed or gratified . His faint blush turned to crimson . “
81097	81098	81056	81056	I	0	” “
81110	81118	81103	81103	I’m	0	” she rejoined , her voice softening . “
81133	81134	81125	81125	Anne	95	” “
81178	81179	81169	81169	You	1324	” “
81206	81218	81196	81196	she	95	” She continued to look at him thoughtfully , almost tenderly . “
81244	81245	81234	81234	you	1324	” “
81263	81264	81253	81253	I	0	” “
81287	81320	81282	81282	you	1324	” She turned again , restlessly , and went and stood by the chimney - piece , resting her chin on her hand . Landers smiled up at her , half deprecatingly . “
81333	81334	81282	81282	you	1324	” “
81356	81357	81363	81363	yours	1324	” “
81367	81368	81363	81363	yours	1324	” “
81381	81423	81363	81363	yours	1324	” He sat silent for a while , meditatively considering his honest boot - tips . At length he spoke again , in a tone of sudden authority , such as came into his voice when business matters were being discussed . “
81435	81442	81424	81424	You	1324	” She looked slowly about her . “
81454	81455	81445	81445	I	0	” “
81463	81464	81445	81445	I	0	” “
81492	81493	81482	81482	I	0	” “
81496	81505	81482	81482	I	0	” She shed a sudden smile on him . “
81512	81549	81507	81507	you	0	” At the question he sprang up out of his armchair with the headlong haste of a young man . The movement upset a little table at his elbow ; but he let the table lie . “
81555	81584	81551	81551	God	195	” he shouted , reaching out to her with both hands . She shrank back a little , not from reluctance but from a sense of paralyzing inadequacy . “
81593	81600	81587	81587	I	0	” she thought with a shiver . “
81615	81619	81603	81603	you	0	” she said . “
81639	81668	81669	81669	Kate	87	” He stood looking at her , waiting for her to speak ; then , as she remained silent , he slowly drew back a step or two . “
81679	81698	81676	81676	your	87	” As she returned his look she was aware that her sight of him was becoming faintly blurred . “
81712	81743	81707	81707	It	1335	” She put her hands in his . XXVIII . In the stillness of the sleeping house she sat up with a start , plucked out of a tormented sleep . “
81760	82334	82335	82335	I	0	” She jumped out of bed , turned on the light , and stared about her . What secret warning had waked her with that cry on her lips ? She could not recall having dreamed : she had only tossed and fought with some impalpable oppression . And now , as she stood there , in that hideously familiar room , the silence went on echoing with her cry . All the excuses , accommodations , mitigations , mufflings , disguisings , had dropped away from the bare fact that her lover was going to marry her daughter , and that nothing she could do would prevent it . A few hours ago she had still counted on the blessed interval of time , the lulling possibilities of delay . She had kissed Anne goodnight very quietly , she remembered . Then it was eleven o’clock of the night before ; now it was the morning of the day . A pitch - black winter morning : there would be no daylight for another three hours . No daylight -- but the Day was here ! She glanced at the clock . Half - past four . The longing seized her to go and look at Anne for the last time ; but the next moment she felt that hardly a sight in the world would be less bearable . She turned back into her room , wrapped herself in her dressing - gown , and went and sat in the window . What did Fifth Avenue look like nowadays at half - past four o’clock of a winter morning ? Much as it had when she had kept the same vigil nearly twenty years earlier , on the morning of her flight with Hylton Davies . That night too she had not slept , and for the same reason : the thought of Anne . On that other day she had deserted her daughter for the first time -- and now it seemed as though she were deserting her again . One betrayal of trust had led inexorably to the other . Fifth Avenue was much more brilliantly lit than on that other far - off morning . Long streamers of radiance floated on the glittering asphalt like tropical sea - weeds on a leaden sea . But overhead the canopy of darkness was as dense , except for the tall lights hanging it here and there with a planetary glory . The street itself was empty . In old times one would have heard the desolate nocturnal sound of a lame hoof - beat as a market - gardener ’s cart went by : they always brought out in the small hours the horses that were too bad to be seen by day . But all that was changed . The last lame horse had probably long since gone to the knacker ’s yard , and no link of sound was left between the Niagara - roar of the day and the hush before dawn . On that other morning a hansom - cab had been waiting around the corner for young Mrs. Clephane . It had all been very well arranged -- Hylton Davies had a gift for arranging . His yacht was a marvel of luxury : food , service , appointments . He was the kind of man who would lean across the table to say confidentially : “
82341	82382	82335	82335	I	0	” He had the soul of a club steward . It was curious to be thinking of him now .... She remembered that , as she jumped into the hansom on that fateful morning , she had thought to herself : “
82420	82525	82527	82527	God	195	” She had fixed her mind with intensity on the things she most detested in the life she was leaving ; it struck her now that she had thought hardly at all of the life she was going to . Above all , that day , she had crammed into her head every possible thought that might crowd out the image of little Anne : John Clephane ’s bad temper , his pettiness about money , his obstinacy , his obtuseness , the detested sound of his latch - key when he came home , flown with self - importance , from his club . “
82529	82534	82527	82527	God	195	” she remembered thinking , “
82548	82751	82527	82527	God	195	” Now she suddenly reminded herself that before long she would have to get used to the click of another key . Dear Fred Landers ! That click would symbolize all the securities and placidities : all the thick layers of affection enfolding her from loneliness , from regret , from remorse . It comforted her already to know that , after tomorrow , there would always be some one between herself and her thoughts . In that mild warmth she would bask like one of those late bunches of grapes that have just time , before they drop , to turn from sourness to insipidity . Now again she was at the old game of packing into her mind every thought that might crowd out the thought of Anne ; but her mind was like a vast echoing vault , and the thoughts she had to put into it would not have filled the palm of her hand . Where would she and Landers live ? A few months of travel , no doubt ; and then -- New York . Could she picture him anywhere else ? Would it be materially possible for him to give up his profession -- renounce “
82754	82860	82861	82862	My darling	1505	” ? Her mind refused to see him in any other setting . And yet -- and yet .... But no ; it was useless to linger on that . Nothing , nothing that she could invent would crowd out the thought of Anne . She sat in the window , and watched the sky turn from black to gray , and then to the blank absence of colour before daylight .... * * * * * In the motor , on the way to St. Stephen ’s , the silence had become oppressive , and Kate suddenly laid her hand on her daughter ’s . “
82882	82883	82864	82864	I	0	” “
82899	82944	82895	82895	You	1505	” Through the white mist of tulle Kate caught the girl ’s constrained smile . She had been too vehement , then ? She had over - emphasized ? Doubtless she would never get exactly the right note . She heard herself murmuring vaguely : “
82956	82962	82965	82965	I	0	” and Anne ’s answer : “
82970	83096	83097	83097	He	1342	” and mercifully that brought them to the verge of the crimson carpet and the awning . In the vestibule of the church they were received into a flutter of family . No bridesmaids ; but Fred Landers and Hendrik Drover , stationed there as participants in the bridal procession , amid a cluster of Drovers and Tresseltons who had lingered for a glimpse of the bride before making their way to the front pews . A pervading lustre of pearls and tall hats ; a cloud of expensive furs , a gradual vague impression of something having possibly gone wrong , and no one wishing to be the first to suggest it . Finally Joe Tresselton approached to say in Mrs. Clephane ’s ear : “
83102	83121	83122	83122	Chris	88	” Anne had caught the whisper . Her mother saw her lips whiten as they framed a laugh . “
83139	83265	83266	83266	Anne	95	” Oh , the tidal rush in the mother ’s breast ! The _ Not here ! Not here ! Not here ! _ shouted down at her from every shaft and curve of the vaulting , rained down on her from the accomplice heavens ! And she had called the sky indifferent ! But of course he was not here -- he would not be here . She had always known that she would wear him out in the end . Her case was so much stronger than his . In a flash all her torturing doubts fell away from her . All about her , wrist - watches were being furtively consulted . Anne stood between the groups , a pillar of snow . “
83274	83661	83266	83266	Anne	95	” Nollie Tresselton laughed ; Uncle Hendrik mumbled something ponderous about traffic obstruction . Once or twice the sexton ’s black gown fluttered enquiringly out of an aisle door and back ; the bridal group began to be aware of the pressure , behind them , of late arrivals checked in the doorway till the procession should have passed into the church . Kate Clephane caught Fred Landers ’s eyes anxiously fixed on her ; she suspected her own of shooting out rays of triumph , and bent down hurriedly to straighten a fold of Anne ’s train . _ Not here ! Not here ! Not here ! _ the sky shouted down at her . And none of them -- except perhaps Anne -- knew why .... Anne -- yes ; Anne ’s suffering would be terrible . But she was young -- she was young ; and some day she would know what she had been saved from .... The central doors were suddenly flung open ; the Mendelssohn march rolled out . Mrs. Clephane started up from her stooping posture to signal to Fred Landers that the doors must be shut .... The music stopped ... since the bridegroom was not coming . But the folds of Anne ’s train were already slipping through her mother ’s fingers , Anne was in motion on Uncle Hendrik ’s stalwart arm . The rest of the family had drifted up to their front pews : Fred Landers , a little flushed , stood before Mrs. Clephane , his arm bent to receive her hand . The bride , softly smiling , drew aside to let her mother pass into the church before her . At the far end of the nave , on the chancel - steps , two figures had appeared against a background of lawn sleeves and lilies . Blindly Kate Clephane moved forward , keeping step with Landers ’s slow stride . At the chancel - steps he left her , taking his seat with Mrs. Drover . The mother stood alone and waited for her daughter . XXIX . The Drovers had wanted Mrs. Clephane to return to Long Island with them that afternoon ; Nollie Tresselton had added her prayer ; Anne herself had urged her mother to accept . “
83674	83688	83664	83664	I	0	” the girl had said ; and Kate had managed to smile back : “
83699	84012	83689	83689	You	1345	” and had added that she wanted to rest , and have time to gather up her things before sailing . It had been settled , in the last days before the wedding , that she was to go abroad for the winter : to Italy , perhaps , or the south of France . The young couple , after a brief dash to Florida , were off for India , by Marseilles and Suez ; it seemed only reasonable that Mrs. Clephane should not care to remain in New York . And Anne knew -- though no one else did -- that when her mother went abroad she would not go alone . Nothing was to be said ... not a word to any one ; though by this time -- an hour after bride and groom had driven away to the Palm Beach express -- Chris Fenno was no doubt in the secret . Anne had left without anxiety ; she understood her mother ’s wish to keep her plans to herself , and respected it . And in a few days now the family would be reassembling at St. Stephen ’s for another , even quieter wedding . * * * * * Aline came downstairs to the long drawing - room , where Mrs. Clephane was sitting alone in a litter of fallen rose - petals , grains of rice and ends of wedding - cake ribbon . Beyond , in the dining - room , the servants were moving away the small tables , and carrying off the silver in green - lined baskets . The house - keeper had come in to give the butler the address of the hospital to which Mrs. Fenno wished the flowers to be sent , and a footman was already removing the baskets and bouquets from the drawing - room . “
84044	84135	84027	84028	Mr. Landers	133	” Aline , of course , knew everything ; news reached her by every pore , as it circulates through an Eastern bazaar . Erect in the handsome dress that Mrs. Clephane had given her for the wedding , she smiled drily but approvingly upon her mistress . It was understood that Mr. Landers was _ un bon parti _ ; and the servants ’ hall knew him to be generous . So did Aline , whose gown was fastened by the diamond arrow he had offered her that morning . “
84148	84184	84027	84028	Mr. Landers	133	” she added persuasively . Kate Clephane sat motionless , without looking up . She heard what the maid was saying , and could have repeated her exact words ; but they conveyed no meaning . “
84190	84230	84185	84185	Madame	1453	” Aline again insisted . The humiliation of being treated like a sick person at length roused Mrs. Clephane , and she got to her feet and followed the maid . On the way upstairs she said to her : “
84244	84488	84232	84232	I	0	” Then she turned into the sitting - room , and Aline softly closed the door on her . The fire was burning briskly ; Anne ’s last bunch of violets stood on the low table near the lounge . Outside the windows the winter light was waning . Kate Clephane , sitting down on the lounge , remembered that the room had worn that same look of soothing intimacy on the day when Anne had first led her into it , little more than a year ago ; and she remembered that , then , also , Fred Landers had joined her there , hurriedly summoned to reassure her loneliness . It was curious , in what neatly recurring patterns events often worked themselves out . The door opened and he came in . He still wore his wedding clothes , and the dark morning coat and the pearl in his tie suited him , gave him a certain air of self - confidence and importance . He looked like a man who would smooth one ’s way , manage all the tiresome details of life admirably , without fuss or bluster . The small point of consciousness left alive in Kate Clephane registered the fact , and was dimly comforted by it . Steamer chairs , for instance , and the right table in a ventilated corner of the dining - saloon -- one would n’t have to bother about anything .... “
84498	84515	84489	84489	I	0	” he said , sitting down beside her , and looking at her with a smile . “
84540	84541	84548	84548	they	1353	” “
84558	84565	84548	84548	they	1353	” she jested with pale lips . “
84578	84584	84572	84572	I	0	” he continued with authority . “
84590	84621	84572	84572	I	0	” She tried to add a word of sympathy , of affection ; the word he was waiting for . But she could only turn her wan smile on him . “
84639	84645	84633	84633	you	1352	” She shook her head . “
84658	84664	84654	84654	you	1352	” His face lit up . “
84677	84678	84681	84681	I	0	” “
84700	84705	84690	84690	I	0	” she suddenly exclaimed . “
84717	84759	84713	84713	I	0	” He sealed it with his quiet smile , leaning toward her a little , but without moving his chair nearer . There was something infinitely reassuring in the way he took things for granted , without undue emphasis or enthusiasm . “
84794	84801	84785	84785	We	1357	” She tried to smile back . “
84811	84844	84845	84845	I	0	” Her eyes rested on his face , and she read in it his effort to remain the unobtrusive and undemanding friend . The sight gave her a little twinge of compunction . “
84862	84905	84860	84860	you	0	” she suggested . The blood mounted to his temples , congesting his cheek - bones and the elderly fold above his stiff collar . He made a movement as if to rise , and then settled back resolutely into his chair . “
84943	84944	84945	84945	I	0	” “
84953	84964	84966	84966	your	0	” She was beginning to smile on him less painfully . “
84970	84983	84969	84969	me--	1358	” But now he stood up , his pink deepening to purple . “
85017	85032	85001	85001	I	0	” She raised herself on her elbow , looking up at him in surprise . “
85044	85045	85038	85038	I	0	” “
85085	85086	85050	85050	you	0	” “
85090	85097	85050	85050	you	0	” She gave a little shrug . “
85110	85121	85122	85122	You	282	” With a slight break in his voice he said : “
85127	85157	85160	85160	yourself	282	” The answer , and his tone , woke in her a painful sense of his intense participation in their talk and her own remoteness from it . The phrase “
85161	85319	85320	85320	Myself	0	” shed a lightning - flash of irony on their reciprocal attitude . What self had she left to come with ? She knew he was waiting for an answer ; she felt the cruelty of letting his exclamation drop as if unheard ; but what more had she to say to him -- unless she should say everything ? The thought shot through her for the first time . Had she really meant to marry him without his knowing ? Perhaps she had ; she was not sure ; she felt she would never again be very sure of her own intentions . But now , through all the confusion and exhaustion of her mind , one fact had become abruptly clear : that she would have to tell him . Whether she married him or not seemed a small matter in comparison . First she must look into those honest eyes with eyes as honest . “
85322	85331	85320	85320	Myself	0	” she said , echoing his last word . “
85343	85358	85334	85334	you	0	” He continued to stand before her in the same absorbed and brooding attitude . “
85371	85384	85367	85367	you	0	” She leaned on her arm , still looking up at him . “
85408	85429	85431	85431	I	0	” This did not seem to surprise him . He continued to return her gaze with the same tranquil eyes . “
85440	85512	85434	85434	I	0	” he said . Something in his voice seemed to tell her that after all she had not been alone in her struggle ; it was as if he had turned a key in the most secret ward of her heart . Oh , if he had really guessed -- if she were to be suddenly lifted beyond that miserable moment of avowal into a quiet heaven of understanding and compassion ! “
85520	85616	85513	85513	You	0	” Yes ; his face was still unperturbed , his eyes were indulgent . The tears rushed to her own ; she wanted to sit down and cry her heart out . Instead , she got to her feet and went to him with outstretched hands . She must thank him ; she would find the words now ; she would be able to tell him what that perfect trust was to her , or at least what it would be when the present was far enough away for anything on earth to help her . “
85646	85662	85635	85635	you	94	” He had her hands in his , and was holding them against his breast . “
85676	85689	85674	85674	you	94	” He was speaking now as if to a frightened disconsolate child . “
85722	85813	85714	85714	Anne	95	” He did understand , then ; did pity her ! She let herself lie in his hold . The relief of avowal was too exquisite , now that all peril of explanation was over and she could just yield herself up to his pity . But though he held her she no longer saw him ; all her attention was centred on her own torturing problem . She thought of him only as of some one kinder and more understanding than any one else , and her heart overflowed . “
85837	85838	85829	85829	me	0	” “
85909	85961	85962	85962	I	0	” he said . Her tears rose and began to run down . She would have liked to go on listening without having to attend to what he said . But again she felt that he was waiting for her to speak , and she tried to smile back at him . “
85982	85991	85972	85972	You	0	” She hardly knew what she was saying . “
86005	86006	86007	86007	Your	0	” “
86020	86027	86028	86028	You	0	” She gave a faint laugh . “
86043	86044	86028	86028	You	0	” “
86049	86050	86047	86047	you	0	” “
86106	86107	86098	86098	I	0	” “
86113	86114	86098	86098	I	0	” “
86121	86166	86167	86167	I	0	” She looked up at him , surprised , and saw that a faint veil had fallen over the light in his eyes . His face had grown pale and she felt that he was holding her hands without knowing that he held them . “
86179	86189	86167	86167	I	0	” He straightened his shoulders and looked at her . “
86205	86227	86201	86201	...	1367	” He paused , as if waiting for her to speak ; then , with a visible effort , went on : “
86250	86261	86240	86240	I’ve	0	” She freed herself gently and moved away from him . “
86266	86278	86240	86240	I’ve	0	” She was conscious in him of a slowly dawning surprise . “
86286	86287	86240	86240	I’ve	0	” “
86300	86337	86338	86338	I	0	” For a moment he seemed hardly to take in the words she was flinging at him . He looked like a man who has not yet felt the pain of the wound he has received . “
86348	86353	86338	86338	I	0	” he answered slowly . “
86371	86415	86416	86416	You	0	” She had almost laughed out as she said it . He seemed to be struggling with an inconceivable idea : an idea for which there were no terms in his vocabulary . His lips moved once or twice before he became articulate . “
86438	86447	86416	86416	You	0	” She made a faint gesture of assent . “
86449	86454	86455	86455	you	0	” he still wavered over it--“something
86466	86484	86486	86486	you	0	” Abruptly he broke off , took a few steps away from her , and came back . “
86494	86745	86486	86486	you	0	” She was silent . The silence continued . He stood without moving , turned away from her . She had dropped down on the foot of the lounge , and sat gazing at the pattern of the carpet . He put his hands over his eyes . Presently , hearing him move , she looked up . He had uncovered his eyes and was staring about the room as if he had never seen it before , and could not remember what had brought him there . His face had shrunk and yellowed ; he seemed years older . As she looked at him , she marvelled at her folly in imagining even for a moment that he had read any farther into her secret than the others . She remembered his first visit after her return ; remembered how she had plied him with uncomfortable questions , and detected in his kindly eyes the terror of the man who , all his life , has tried to buy off fate by optimistic evasions . Fate had caught up with him now -- Kate Clephane would have given the world if it had not been through her agency . Sterile pain -- it appeared that she was to inflict it after all , and on the one being who really loved her , who would really have helped her had he known how ! He moved nearer , and stood in front of her , forcing a thin smile . “
86758	86807	86808	86808	I	0	” he said . She could not find anything to answer . Her tears had stopped , and she sat dry - eyed , counting the circles in the carpet . When she had reached the fifteenth she heard him speaking again in the same stiff concise tone . “
86817	86818	86810	86810	I	0	” “
86826	86849	86850	86850	I	0	” She stood up , and continued in a low colourless voice , as if the words were being dictated to her : “
86912	86913	86906	86906	I	0	” “
86919	86927	86906	86906	I	0	” he ejaculated . She smiled faintly . “
87205	87206	87199	87199	I	0	” “
87225	87230	87223	87223	Anne	95	” he exclaimed harshly . “
87242	87266	87239	87240	that man	1369	” He dropped down into his armchair and hid his eyes again . She waited a minute or two ; then she ventured : “
87273	87293	87239	87240	that man	1369	” He made no answer . At length he lifted his head , but without looking directly at her . “
87300	87301	87239	87240	that man	1369	” “
87315	87334	87310	87310	I	0	” She heard herself pushing the date back farther and farther , but she could not help it . “
87346	87347	87310	87310	I	0	” “
87356	87364	87310	87310	I	0	” She added , after a moment : “
87373	87374	87375	87376	The cad	1379	” “
87382	87387	87381	87381	I--	0	” She interrupted him . “
87463	87464	87451	87451	I	0	” “
87466	87518	87519	87519	You	95	” There was a slight break in the harshness of his voice . Again she was silent , not through the wish to avoid speaking , but from sheer inability to find anything more to say . Suddenly he lifted his miserable eyes , and looked at her for a second . “
87525	87529	87519	87519	You	95	” he said . “
87537	87564	87532	87532	I	0	” She stopped , and then , drawn by the pity in his tone , once more felt herself slipping down the inevitable slope of confession . “
87725	87842	87843	87843	Fred	94	” After she had ended he continued to sit without moving ; she had the impression that he had not heard what she had said . His attention , his receptive capacity , were still engrossed by the stark fact of her confession : her image and Chris Fenno ’s were slowly burning themselves into his shrinking vision . To assist at the process was like peeping into a torture - chamber , and for the moment she lost the sense of her own misery in the helpless contemplation of his . Sterile pain , if ever there was-- At last she crossed over to where he sat , and laid a touch on his shoulder . “
87884	88225	87843	87843	Fred	94	” He did not change his attitude or even look up again . She still doubted if he heard her . After a minute or two she withdrew her hand and moved away . The strain had been too great ; she had imposed on him more than he could bear . She saw that clearly now : she said to herself that their talk was over , that they were already leagues apart . Her sentimental experience had shown her how often two people still in the act of exchanging tender or violent words are in reality at the opposite ends of the earth , and she reflected , ironically , how much success in human affairs depends on the power to detect such displacements . She herself had no such successes to her credit ; hers was at best the doubtful gift of discerning , perhaps more quickly than most people , why she failed . But to all such shades of suffering her friend was impervious : he was taking his ordeal in bulk . She sat down and waited . Curiously enough , she was less unhappy than for a long time past . His pain and his pity were perhaps what she had most needed from him : the centre of her wretchedness seemed the point at which they were meant to meet . If only she could have put it in words simple enough to reach him -- but to thank him for what he was suffering would have seemed like mockery ; and she could only wait and say to herself that perhaps before long he would go . After a while he lifted his head and slowly got to his feet . For a moment he seemed to waver ; then he crossed the space between them , and stood before her . She rose too , and held out her hand ; but he did not appear to notice the gesture , though his eyes were now intensely fixed on her . “
88231	88235	87843	87843	Fred	94	” he said , “
88259	88339	88252	88252	I	0	” She looked up , not understanding . Then she began to tremble in all her body ; her very lips trembled , and the lids of her dazzled eyes . He was still looking at her , and she saw the dawn of the old kindness in his . He seemed to have come out on the other side of a great darkness . But all she found to say was the denial of what she was feeling . “
88347	88356	88252	88252	I	0	” ; and she put him from her . “
88359	88360	88252	88252	I	0	” “
88375	88382	88368	88368	you	0	” She stammered it out incoherently . “
88395	88406	88388	88388	I	0	” He stood rooted there in his mild obstinate kindness . “
88419	88420	88388	88388	I	0	” “
88427	88466	88388	88388	I	0	” She caught his hand , and just laid it to her cheek . Then she drew back , with a sense of resolution , of finality , that must have shown itself in her face and air . “
88484	88549	88479	88479	I	0	” She said it almost like a child who asks to be taken up and carried . It seemed to her that for the first time in her life she had been picked up out of the dust and weariness , and set down in a quiet place where no harm could come . He was still looking at her , uncertainly , pleadingly . “
88557	88561	88479	88479	I	0	” She hesitated . “
88565	88566	88479	88479	I	0	” “
88573	88574	88569	88569	you	0	” “
88580	88652	88653	88653	Aline	90	” With that -- their hands just clasping -- she guided him gently to the door , and stood waiting till she heard his step go down the stair . Then she turned back into the room and opened the door of her bedroom . The maid was there , preparing a becoming tea - gown . She had no doubt conjectured that Mr. Landers would be coming back for dinner . “
88670	88685	88653	88653	Aline	90	” The maid stood staring , incredulous , the shimmering dress on her arm . “
88694	88695	88653	88653	Aline	90	” “
88705	88731	88653	88653	Aline	90	” Mrs. Clephane explained , hurriedly reaching for the telephone book . Aline ’s look seemed to say that this was beyond all reasonable explanation . “
88755	88756	88744	88744	Madame	130	” “
88779	88780	88768	88768	You	90	” “
88799	88808	88809	88809	I	0	” Mrs. Clephane almost laughed in her face . “
88830	89005	88809	88809	I	0	” She unhooked the receiver . XXX . Kate Clephane was wakened by the slant of Riviera sun across her bed . The hotel was different ; it was several rungs higher on the ladder than the Minorque et l’Univers , as its name -- the Petit Palais -- plainly indicated . The bedroom , too , was bigger , more modern , more freshly painted ; and the corner window of the tiny adjoining _ salon _ actually clipped a wedge of sea in its narrow frame . So much was changed for the better in Mrs. Clephane ’s condition ; in other respects , she had the feeling of having simply turned back a chapter , and begun again at the top of the same dull page . Her maid , Aline , was obviously of the same opinion ; in spite of the more commodious room , and the sitting - room with its costly inset of sea , Mrs. Clephane had not recovered her lost prestige in Aline ’s estimation . “
89024	89592	89593	89593	Aline	90	” Aline ’s look seemed to say , every morning when she brought in the breakfast - tray . Even the fact that letters now lay on it more frequently , and that telegrams were no longer considered epoch - making , did not compensate for the general collapse of Aline ’s plans and ambitions . When one had had a good roof over one ’s head , and a good motor at one ’s door , what was the sense of bolting away from them at a moment ’s notice and coming back to second - rate hotels and rattling taxis , with all the loss of consequence implied ? Aline remained icily silent when her mistress , after a few weeks at the Petit Palais , mentioned that she had written to enquire about prices at Dinard for the summer . Kate Clephane , on the whole , took the change more philosophically . To begin with , it had been her own choice to fly as she had ; and that in itself was a help -- at times ; and then -- well , yes,--already , after the first weeks , she had begun to be aware that she was slipping back without too much discomfort into the old groove . The first month after her arrival would n’t yet bear thinking about ; but it was well behind her now , and habit was working its usual miracle . She had been touched by the welcome her old friends and acquaintances had given her , and exquisitely relieved -- after the first plunge -- to find herself again among people who asked no questions about her absence , betrayed no curiosity about it , and probably felt none . They were all very much occupied with each other ’s doings when they were together , but the group was so continually breaking up and reshaping itself , with the addition of new elements , and the departing scattered in so many different directions , and toward destinations so unguessable , that once out of sight they seemed to have no more substance or permanence than figures twitching by on a film . This sense of unsubstantiality had eased Kate Clephane ’s taut nerves , and helped her to sink back almost unaware into her old way of life . Enough was known of her own existence in the interval -- a shadowy glimpse of New York opulence , an Opera box , a massive and important family , a beautiful daughter married to a War Hero -- to add considerably to her standing in the group ; but her Riviera friends were all pleasantly incurious as to details . In most of their lives there were episodes to be bridged over by verbal acrobatics , and they were all accustomed to taking each other ’s fibs at their face - value . Of Mrs. Clephane they did not even ask any : she came back handsomer , better dressed -- yes , my dear , actually _ sables_!--and she offered them cock - tails and Mah - Jongg in her own sitting - room ( with a view of the sea thrown in ) . They were glad of so useful a recruit , and the distance between her social state and theirs was not wide enough to awaken acrimony or envy . “
89595	89624	89593	89593	Aline	90	” The maid ’s door was just across the passage now ; she appeared almost at once , bearing a breakfast - tray on which were several letters . “
89627	89785	89625	89625	Violets	237	” she announced with a smile ; Aline ’s severity had of late been tempered by an occasional smile . But Mrs. Clephane did not turn her head ; her colour did not change . These violets were not from the little lame boy whose bouquet had flushed her with mysterious hopes on the day when her daughter ’s cable had called her home ; the boy she had set up for life ( it had been her first thought after landing ) because of that happy coincidence . Today ’s violets embodied neither hope nor mystery . She knew from whom they came , and what stage in what game they represented ; and lifting them from the tray after a brief sniff , she poured out her chocolate with a steady hand . Aline , perceptibly rebuffed , but not defeated , put the flowers into a glass on her mistress ’s dressing - table . “
89788	89793	89794	89794	she	1394	” the gesture said , “
89801	90008	89794	89794	she	1394	” Mrs. Clephane leaned back against her pink - lined pillows , and sipped her chocolate with deliberation . She had not yet opened the letters , or done more than briefly muster their superscriptions . None from her daughter : Anne , at the moment , was half - way across the Red Sea , on her way to India , and there would be no news of her for several weeks to come . None of the letters was interesting enough to be worth a glance . Mrs. Clephane went over them once or twice , as if looking for one that was missing ; then she pushed them aside and took up the local newspaper . She had got back into her old habit of lingering on every little daily act , making the most of it , spreading it out over as many minutes as possible , in the effort to cram her hours so full that there should be no time for introspection or remembrance ; and she read the paper carefully , from the grandiloquent leading article on the wonders of the approaching Carnival to the column in which the doings of the local and foreign society were glowingly recorded . “
90058	90244	90245	90246	That woman	1400	” Ah -- to be sure ; it was today ! Kate Clephane laid down the newspaper with a smile . She was recalling Mrs. Minity ’s wrath when it had been announced that the reception for the new Bishop was to be given by Mrs. Parley Plush -- Mrs. Plush , of all people ! Mrs. Minity was not an active member of the Reverend Mr. Merriman ’s parochial committees ; her bodily inertia , and the haunting fear of what might happen if her coachman tried to turn the horses in the narrow street in which the Rectory stood , debarred her from such participation ; but she was nevertheless a pillar of the church , by reason of a small but regular donation to its fund and a large and equally regular commentary on its affairs . Mr. Merriman gave her opinions almost the importance she thought they deserved ; and a dozen times in the season Mrs. Merriman was expected to bear the brunt of her criticisms , and persuade her not to give up her pew and stop her subscription . “
90248	90254	90245	90246	That woman	1400	” Mrs. Minity would cry , “
90283	90432	90245	90246	That woman	1400	” Mrs. Minity , on the occasion of the last drive , had not failed to tell Mrs. Merriman what she thought of the idea -- put forward , of course , by Mrs. Plush herself -- of that lady ’s being chosen to entertain the new Bishop on his first tour of his diocese . The scandal was bad enough : did Mrs. Merriman want Mrs. Minity to tell her what the woman had been , what her reputation was ? No ; Mrs. Merriman would rather not . She probably knew well enough herself , if she had chosen to admit it ... but for Mrs. Minity the real bitterness of the situation lay in the fact that she herself could not eclipse Mrs. Plush by giving the reception because she lived in a small flat instead of a large -- a vulgarly large -- villa . “
90445	90470	90245	90246	That woman	1400	” ; ( this to Kate Clephane , the day after Mrs. Merriman had been taken on the latest of her penitential drives ) ; “
90607	90617	90619	90620	the Bishop	1415	” said Mrs. Minity in the voice of Cassandra , “
90696	90778	90664	90694	a doctor who _ absolutely forbids _ all agitating discussions , and warns me that if anybody should say anything disagreeable to me I might be snuffed out on the spot	1419	” Kate Clephane had smiled ; these little rivalries were beginning to amuse her again . And the amusement of seeing Mrs. Minity appear ( as of course she would ) at Mrs. Plush ’s that afternoon made it seem almost worth while to go there . Mrs. Clephane reached out for her engagement - book , scrutinized the day ’s page , and found -- with another smile , this one at herself -- that she had already noted down : “
90780	90966	90664	90694	a doctor who _ absolutely forbids _ all agitating discussions , and warns me that if anybody should say anything disagreeable to me I might be snuffed out on the spot	1419	” . Yes ; it was true ; she knew it herself : she still had to go on cramming things into her days , things good , bad or indifferent , it hardly mattered which as long as they were crammed tight enough to leave no chinks for backward glances . Her old training in the art of taking things easily -- all the narcotic tricks of evasion and ignoring -- had come gradually to her help in the struggle to remake her life . Of course she would go to Mrs. Plush ’s ... just as surely as Mrs. Minity would . * * * * * The day was glorious ; exactly the kind of day , all the ladies said , on which one would want the dear Bishop to have his first sight of his new diocese . The whole strength of the Anglo - American colony was assembled on Mrs. Plush ’s flowery terraces , among the beds of cineraria and cyclamen , and the giant blue china frogs which , as Mrs. Plush said , made the garden look “
90969	90998	91021	91022	Mrs. Clephane	187	” . Mrs. Plush herself sailed majestically from group to group , keeping one eye on the loggia through which the Bishop and Mr. Merriman were to arrive . “
91034	91166	91167	91169	a typical case	1424	” Mrs. Plush beamed , waving a tall disenchanted - looking man in the direction of a palm - tree emerging from a cushion of pansies . Mrs. Clephane , from under the palm , had seen the manœuvre , and smiled at that also . She knew she was Lord Charles ’s pretext for coming to the reception , but she knew , also , that he was glad to have a pretext , because if he had n’t come he would n’t have known any more than she did what to do with the afternoon . There was nothing , she sometimes felt , that she did n’t know about Lord Charles , though they had met only three months ago . He was so exactly what medical men call “
91171	91322	91167	91169	a typical case	1424	” and she had had such unlimited time and opportunity for the study of his particular type . The only difference was that he was a gentleman -- a gentleman still ; while the others , most of them , never had been , or else had long since abdicated that with the rest . As he moved over the sunlit gravel in her direction she asked herself for the hundredth time what she meant to do about it . Marry him ? God forbid ! Even if she had been sure -- and in her heart of hearts she wasn’t -- that he intended to give her the chance . Fall in love with him ? That too she shrugged away . Let him make love to her ? Well a little ... perhaps ... when one was too lonely ... and because he was the only man at all “
91324	91488	91489	91489	One	247	” in their set .... But what she most wanted of him was simply to fill certain empty hours ; to know that when she came home at five he would be waiting there , half the days of the week , by her tea - table ; that when she dined out , people would be sure to invite him and put him next to her ; that when there was no bridge or Mah - Jongg going he would always be ready for a tour of the antiquity shops , and so sharp at picking up bargains for the little flat she had in view . That was all she wanted of him ; perhaps all he wanted of her . But the possibility of his wanting more ( at which the violets seemed to hint ) produced an uncertainty not wholly disagreeable , especially when he and she met in company , and she guessed the other women ’s envy . “
91498	91554	91167	91169	a typical case	1424	” It was the old argument of the drug - takers : well , call Lord Charles her drug ! Why not , when she was so visibly his ? She settled herself in a garden - chair and watched his approach . It was a skilful bit of manœuvring : she knew he intended to “
91558	92118	92119	92120	Mrs. Clephane	187	” and join her only when there was no danger of their being disturbed . She could imagine how , in old days , he would have stalked contemptuously through such a company , without a glance to right or left . But not now . He had reached a phase in his decline when it became prudent to pause and admire the view at Mrs. Plush ’s side , exchange affabilities with the Consul ’s wife , nod familiarly to Mr. Paly , and even suffer himself to be boisterously hailed by Mrs. Horace Betterly , who came clinking down the loggia steps to shout out a reminder that they counted on him for dinner that evening . It was the fate of those who had to stuff their days full , and could no longer be particular about the quality of the stuffing . Kate could almost see the time when Lord Charles , very lean and wizened , would be collecting china frogs for Mrs. Plush . He was half - way across the terrace when a sudden expanding and agitating of Mrs. Plush ’s plumes seemed to forerun the approach of the Bishop . An impressive black figure appeared under the central arch of the loggia . Mrs. Plush surged forward , every fold of her draperies swelling : but the new arrival was not the Bishop -- it was only Mrs. Minity who , clothed in black cashmere and majesty , paused and looked about her . Mrs. Plush , checked in her forward plunge , stood an instant rigid , almost tilted backward ; her right hand sketched the gesture of two barely extended fingers ; then her just resentment of Mrs. Minity ’s strictures was swept away in the triumph of having her there at last , and Mrs. Plush swept on full sail , welcoming her unexpected guest as obsequiously as if Mrs. Minity had been the Bishop . Kate Clephane looked on with lazy amusement . She could enjoy the humours of her little world now that her mind was more at leisure . She hoped the scene between Mrs. Plush and Mrs. Minity would prolong itself , and was getting up to move within ear - shot when the Bishop , supported by Mr. and Mrs. Merriman , at length appeared . Mrs. Clephane stopped short half - way across the terrace . She had never dreamed of this -- never once thought it possible . Yet now she remembered that Dr. Arklow had been spoken of at the Drovers ’ as one of the candidates for this new diocese ; and there he stood , on the steps just above her , benignant and impressive as when she had last seen him , at St. Stephen ’s , placing Anne ’s hand in Chris Fenno ’s .... Mrs. Clephane ’s first impulse was to turn and lose herself in the crowd . The sight of that figure brought with it too many banished scenes and obliterated memories . Back they all rushed on her , fiercely importunate ; she felt their cruel fingers at her throat . For a moment she stood irresolute , detached in the middle of the terrace ; then , just as she was turning , she heard Mrs. Plush ’s trumpet - call : “
92143	92203	92135	92136	the Bishop	1415	” He seemed to reach her in a stride , so completely did his approach span distances and wipe out time . She saw herself sitting again in a deep leather armchair , under the photogravure of Salisbury Cathedral , while he paced the worn rug before the hearth , and his preacher ’s voice broke on the words : “
92207	92208	92119	92120	Mrs. Clephane	187	” “
92222	92253	92119	92120	Mrs. Clephane	187	” the Bishop suggested . They stood by a white balustrade under mimosa boughs , and exchanged futilities about the blueness of the sea and the heat of the sun . “
92261	92262	92267	92267	you	1415	” “
92301	92311	92312	92313	My dear	1477	” He laid his large hand deliberately on hers . “
92324	92344	92317	92317	you	1477	” She felt her face just brushed by the understanding look she had caught twice before in his eyes . “
92351	92370	92312	92313	My dear	1477	” He waited as if to weigh the answer , and then turned his eyes on the Mediterranean . “
92391	92396	92403	92403	he	1434	” She answered precipitately : “
92406	92407	92403	92403	he	1434	” “
92428	92436	92417	92417	He	1434	” She dropped her voice to say : “
92453	92454	92439	92439	he	1434	” “
92490	92506	92509	92509	I	0	” There was a silence . At length she mastered her voice enough to say : “
92524	92525	92509	92509	I	0	” “
92529	92550	92509	92509	I	0	” She waited again , and then , lifting her eyes , caught once more the understanding look in his . “
92572	92580	92569	92569	my	0	” she lowered her voice still more ... “
92595	92607	92569	92569	my	0	” She saw the first tinge of perplexity in his gaze . “
92613	92614	92569	92569	my	0	” “
92620	92641	92569	92569	my	0	” Ah , it was useless ; he would never understand ! How could she have imagined that he would ? “
92654	92659	92646	92646	your	0	” he questioned mildly . “
92679	92708	92672	92672	It	1435	” she almost sobbed . No ; he would never understand . His face had once more become blank and benedictory . He pressed her hand , said : “
92725	92790	92719	92719	we	1437	” and passed on , urbane and unperceiving . Her eyes filled ; for a moment her loneliness came down on her like a pall . It was always so whenever she tried to explain , not only to others but even to herself . Yet deep down in her , deeper far than her poor understanding could reach , there was something that said “
