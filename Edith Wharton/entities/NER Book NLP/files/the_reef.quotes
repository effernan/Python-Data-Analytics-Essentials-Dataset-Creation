4649	4678	4679	4679	Darrow	71	“ Dear , no ! But I wrote notes , and made up the visiting - book , and walked the dogs , and saw bores for her . ”

4967	4972	4973	4973	he	71	“ It ’s better , ”
4976	4986	4973	4973	he	71	“ than your thinking I came for Mrs. Murrett ! ”
4987	5032	4973	4973	he	71	“ Oh , we never thought anybody came for Mrs. Murrett ! It was always for something else : the music , or the cook -- when there was a good one -- or the other people ; generally ONE of the other people . ”
5033	5037	5038	5038	She	276	“ I see . ”
5113	5128	5272	5272	her	295	“ Who were the ‘ we ’ ? Were you a cloud of witnesses ? ”
5129	5138	5139	5139	She	276	“ There were a good many of us . ”
5142	5228	5139	5139	She	276	“ Let me see -- who was there in your time ? Mrs. Bolt -- and Mademoiselle -- and Professor Didymus and the Polish Countess . Do n’t you remember the Polish Countess ? She crystal - gazed , and played accompaniments , and Mrs. Murrett chucked her because Mrs. Didymus accused her of hypnotizing the Professor . But of course you do n’t remember . We were all invisible to you ; but we could see . And we all used to wonder about you---- ”
5238	5243	5139	5139	She	276	“ What about me ? ”
5244	5255	5256	5256	He	71	“ Well -- whether it was you or she who ... ”
5274	5287	5272	5272	her	295	“ And what , if one may ask , was your conclusion ? ”
5288	5313	5139	5139	She	276	“ Well , Mrs. Bolt and Mademoiselle and the Countess naturally thought it was SHE ; but Professor Didymus and Jimmy Brance -- especially Jimmy---- ”
5314	5326	5327	5327	She	295	“ Just a moment : who on earth is Jimmy Brance ? ”
5332	5354	5327	5327	She	295	“ You WERE absorbed -- not to remember Jimmy Brance ! He must have been right about you , after all . ”
5364	5378	5355	5355	She	295	“ But how could you ? She was false from head to foot ! ”
5379	5382	5139	5139	She	276	“ False---- ? ”
5410	5494	5495	5495	She	82	“ Oh , I only meant externally ! You see , she often used to come to my room after tennis , or to touch up in the evenings , when they were going on ; and I assure you she took apart like a puzzle . In fact I used to say to Jimmy -- just to make him wild-- : ‘ I ’ll bet you anything you like there ’s nothing wrong , because I know she ’d never dare un-- ’ ”
5552	5556	5557	5557	she	82	“ Of course , ”
5563	5571	5557	5557	she	82	“ I only said it to tease Jimmy---- ”
5578	5586	5587	5587	he	71	“ Oh , you ’re all alike ! ”
5612	5769	5770	5770	She	82	“ You say that because you think I ’m spiteful and envious ? Yes -- I was envious of Lady Ulrica ... Oh , not on account of you or Jimmy Brance ! Simply because she had almost all the things I ’ve always wanted : clothes and fun and motors , and admiration and yachting and Paris -- why , Paris alone would be enough!--And how do you suppose a girl can see that sort of thing about her day after day , and never wonder why some women , who do n’t seem to have any more right to it , have it all tumbled into their laps , while others are writing dinner invitations , and straightening out accounts , and copying visiting lists , and finishing golf - stockings , and matching ribbons , and seeing that the dogs get their sulphur ? One looks in one ’s glass , after all ! ”
5856	5876	5877	5877	she	82	“ That ’s the kind of education I got at Mrs. Murrett’s -- and I never had any other , ”
5883	5893	5877	5877	she	82	“ Good Lord -- were you there so long ? ”
5894	5909	5910	5910	She	82	“ Five years . I stuck it out longer than any of the others . ”
5922	5934	5910	5910	She	82	“ Well , thank God you ’re out of it now ! ”
5944	5955	5910	5910	She	82	“ Yes -- I’m out of it now fast enough . ”
5956	5970	5971	5971	She	82	“ And what -- if I may ask -- are you doing next ? ”
5987	6000	5971	5971	She	82	“ I ’m going to Paris : to study for the stage . ”
6001	6005	6006	6006	Darrow	71	“ The stage ? ”
6035	6047	6031	6031	he	71	“ Ah -- then you will have Paris , after all ! ”
6048	6068	6031	6031	he	71	“ Hardly Lady Ulrica ’s Paris . It s not likely to be roses , roses all the way . ”
6069	6076	6031	6031	he	71	“ It ’s not , indeed . ”
6084	6096	6080	6080	him	71	“ Have you any -- any influence you can count on ? ”
6105	6121	6122	6122	He	71	“ None but my own . I ’ve never had any other to count on . ”
6129	6148	6122	6122	He	71	“ But have you any idea how the profession is over - crowded ? I know I ’m trite---- ”
6149	6167	6221	6221	she	82	“ I ’ve a very clear idea . But I could n’t go on as I was . ”
6168	6211	6212	6212	She	82	“ Of course not . But since , as you say , you ’d stuck it out longer than any of the others , could n’t you at least have held on till you were sure of some kind of an opening ? ”
6233	6240	6241	6241	she	82	“ Ought n’t we be starting ? ”
6319	6327	6328	6328	she	82	“ The truth is , we quarrelled , ”
6332	6347	6328	6328	she	82	“ and I left last night without my dinner -- and without my salary . ”
6348	6350	6351	6351	he	71	“ Ah-- ”
6373	6379	6380	6380	she	82	“ And without a character ! ”
6392	6423	6380	6380	she	82	“ And without a trunk , as it appears -- but did n’t you say that , before going , there ’d be time for another look at the station ? ”

9575	9690	9691	9691	Darrow	71	“ It ’s delicious enough just to KNOW she ’s there ! I ’ve never seen her , you know . When I was here with Mamie Hoke we never went anywhere but to the music halls , because she could n’t understand any French ; and when I came back afterward to the Farlows ’ I was dead broke , and could n’t afford the play , and neither could they ; so the only chance we had was when friends of theirs invited us -- and once it was to see a tragedy by a Roumanian lady , and the other time it was for ‘ L’Ami Fritz ’ at the Francais . ”
9694	9741	9742	9742	he	71	“ You must do better than that now . ‘ Le Vertige ’ is a fine thing , and Cerdine gets some wonderful effects out of it . You must come with me tomorrow evening to see it -- with your friends , of course.--That is , ”
9745	9757	9742	9742	he	71	“ if there ’s any sort of chance of getting seats . ”
9770	9789	9742	9742	he	71	“ Oh , will you really take us ? What fun to think that it ’s tomorrow already ! ”
9863	9901	9855	9855	she	418	“ No . I meant to , of course , but one is so overwhelmed with things in Paris . And then I ’m rather sick of Cerdine -- one is always being dragged to see her . ”
10026	10048	10018	10018	She	82	“ It ’s too beautiful of you ! Oh , do n’t you THINK you ’ll be able to get seats ? ”
10059	10104	10018	10018	She	82	“ I wonder if you ’ll think me horrid?--but it may be my only chance ; and if you ca n’t get places for us all , would n’t you perhaps just take ME ? After all , the Farlows may have seen it ! ”
10140	10148	10149	10149	he	71	“ Oh , you shall go somehow ! ”
10614	10627	10636	10636	she	82	“ There are things THERE that I want so desperately to see ! ”

10994	11020	11021	11021	She	82	“ I adore it ! I always adore new dresses -- why , you do n’t mean to say it ’s NOT a new one ? ”
11027	11059	11021	11021	She	82	“ No , no , no ! My trunk has n’t come , and this is only my old rag of yesterday -- but I never knew the trick to fail ! ”
11066	11070	11071	11071	she	82	“ You see , ”
11075	11241	11071	11071	she	82	“ I ’ve always had to dress in all kinds of dreary left - overs , and sometimes , when everybody else was smart and new , it used to make me awfully miserable . So one day , when Mrs. Murrett dragged me down unexpectedly to fill a place at dinner , I suddenly thought I ’d try spinning around like that , and say to every one : ‘ WELL , WHAT DO YOU THINK OF ME ? ’ And , do you know , they were all taken in , including Mrs. Murrett , who did n’t recognize my old turned and dyed rags , and told me afterward it was awfully bad form to dress as if I were somebody that people would expect to know ! And ever since , whenever I ’ve particularly wanted to look nice , I ’ve just asked people what they thought of my new frock ; and they ’re always , always taken in ! ”

I ’m rather hoping the Farlows may find me a chance of that kind -- an engagement with some American family in Paris who would want to be ‘ gone round ’ with like the Hokes , and who ’d leave me time enough to study . ”

20496	20533	20489	20489	She	82	“ But when I wrote yesterday I asked them to telegraph . I suppose they ’re horribly hard up , the poor dears , and they thought a letter would do as well as a telegram . ”

21829	21862	21817	21817	he	217	“ I need n’t have told you I ’d kept back your letter ; and my telling you seems rather strong proof that I had n’t any very nefarious designs on you . ”

21891	21959	21885	21885	he	217	“ were not nefarious . I saw you ’d been through a bad time with Mrs. Murrett , and that there did n’t seem to be much fun ahead for you ; and I did n’t see -- and I do n’t yet see -- the harm of trying to give you a few hours of amusement between a depressing past and a not particularly cheerful future . ”
21977	22062	22063	22063	He	217	“ The mistake I made was not to tell you this at once -- not to ask you straight out to give me a day or two , and let me try to make you forget all the things that are troubling you . I was a fool not to see that if I ’d put it to you in that way you ’d have accepted or refused , as you chose ; but that at least you would n’t have mistaken my intentions.--Intentions ! ”
22099	22193	22194	22194	He	670	“ What rubbish we talk about intentions ! The truth is I had n’t any : I just liked being with you . Perhaps you do n’t know how extraordinarily one can like being with you ... I was depressed and adrift myself ; and you made me forget my bothers ; and when I found you were going -- and going back to dreariness , as I was -- I did n’t see why we should n’t have a few hours together first ; so I left your letter in my pocket . ”
22214	22245	22205	22205	she	671	“ But are YOU unhappy too ? Oh , I never understood -- I never dreamed it ! I thought you ’d always had everything in the world you wanted ! ”

22353	22417	22343	22343	She	671	“ Oh , it ’s not so often that people try to give me any pleasure -- much less two whole days of it ! I sha’n’t forget how kind you ’ve been . I shall have plenty of time to remember . But this IS good - bye , you know . I must telegraph at once to say I ’m coming . ”
22418	22431	22340	22340	he	670	“ To say you ’re coming ? Then I ’m not forgiven ? ”
22432	22445	22531	22531	Her	671	“ Oh , you ’re forgiven -- if that ’s any comfort . ”
22446	22466	22467	22467	She	671	“ It ’s not , the very least , if your way of proving it is to go away ! ”
22474	22484	22485	22485	she	671	“ But I ca n’t stay.--How CAN I stay ? ”
22497	22516	22485	22485	she	671	“ Why ca n’t you ? No one knows you ’re here ... No one need ever know . ”

22556	22584	22550	22550	she	671	“ it ’s not people I ’m afraid of ! They ’ve never put themselves out for me -- why on earth should I care about them ? ”
22597	22612	22550	22550	she	671	“ Well , then , what is it ? Not ME , I hope ? ”
22613	22650	22550	22550	she	671	“ No , not you : I like you . It ’s the money ! With me that ’s always the root of the matter . I could never yet afford a treat in my life ! ”
22651	22658	22659	22659	He	674	“ Is _ THAT _ all ? ”
22667	22688	22659	22659	He	674	“ Look here ; since we re talking as man to man -- can’t you trust me about that too ? ”
22689	22705	22706	22706	she	671	“ Trust you ? How do you mean ? You ’d better not trust ME ! ”
22711	22721	22706	22706	she	671	“ I might never be able to pay up ! ”
22729	22849	22850	22850	he	674	“ Money may be the root of the matter ; it ca n’t be the whole of it , between friends . Do n’t you think one friend may accept a small service from another without looking too far ahead or weighing too many chances ? The question turns entirely on what you think of me . If you like me well enough to be willing to take a few days ’ holiday with me , just for the pleasure of the thing , and the pleasure you ’ll be giving me , let ’s shake hands on it . If you do n’t like me well enough we ’ll shake hands too ; only I shall be sorry , ”
22853	22863	22850	22850	he	674	“ Oh , but I shall be sorry too ! ”

22961	23018	22941	22941	he	71	“ Why on earth should we say good - bye if we ’re both sorry to ? Wo n’t you tell me your reason ? It ’s not a bit like you to let anything stand in the way of your saying just what you feel . You must n’t mind offending me , you know ! ”
23064	23091	23046	23046	she	671	“ What I feel ? Do you want to know what I feel ? That you ’re giving me the only chance I ’ve ever had ! ”

My mother , of course , got hers from Monsieur de Chantelle , and they seem to me as much in their place in this house as the pot - pourri in your hawthorn jar . They preserve a social tradition of which I should be sorry to lose the least perfume . Of course I do n’t expect you , just at first , to feel the difference , to see the nuance . In the case of little Madame de Vireville , for instance : you point out that she ’s still under her husband ’s roof . Very true ; and if she were merely a Paris acquaintance -- especially if you had met her , as one still might , in the RIGHT KIND of house in Paris -- I should be the last to object to your visiting her . But in the country it ’s different . Even the best provincial society is what you would call narrow : I do n’t deny it ; and if some of our friends met Madame de Vireville at Givre -- well , it would produce a bad impression . You ’re inclined to ridicule such considerations , but gradually you ’ll come to see their importance ; and meanwhile , do trust me when I ask you to be guided by my mother . It is always well for a stranger in an old society to err a little on the side of what you call its prejudices but I should rather describe as its traditions . ”
29705	29708	29697	29697	she	842	“ real life ”
29818	29822	29801	29801	he	174	“ called to enquire ”
30391	30395	30364	30364	his	867	“ full - length ”
30514	30520	30566	30566	Anna	97	“ the light was better , ”
30576	30602	30603	30603	Anna	97	“ Of course they never came , you poor thing ! I wonder how long it took you to find out that they never would ? ”
30662	30833	30834	30834	She	895	“ She certainly does n’t look as if they would have been the same kind as mine : but there ’s no telling , from a portrait that was so obviously done ‘ to please the family ’ , and that leaves Owen so unaccounted for . Well , they never came , the visitors ; they never came ; and she died of it . She died of it long before they buried her : I ’m certain of that . Those are stone - dead eyes in the picture ... The loneliness must have been awful , if even Owen could n’t keep her from dying of it . And to feel it so she must have HAD feelings -- real live ones , the kind that twitch and tug . And all she had to look at all her life was a gilt console -- yes , that ’s it , a gilt console screwed to the wall ! That ’s exactly and absolutely what he is ! ”
30939	30944	30930	30930	Owen	75	“ old enough to understand ”
31350	31355	31345	31345	She	895	“ This is nonsense ! ”
31361	31367	31369	31369	she	895	“ But it ’s glorious ! ”
31410	31418	31419	31419	she	895	“ No , I ’m not mad , ”
31423	31447	31448	31448	she	895	“ but there ’s something in the air today -- don’t you feel it?--And I wanted to have a little talk with you , ”
31499	31515	31516	31516	she	895	“ Owen , do n’t look like that ! I do n’t want you to ! ”
31523	31556	31557	31557	he	910	“ You said that exactly like Effie . What do you want me to do ? To race with you as I do Effie ? But I should n’t have a show ! ”
31569	31575	31576	31576	she	895	“ Where are you going ? ”
31579	31612	31576	31576	she	895	“ To the kennels . But there ’s not the least need . The vet has seen Garry and he ’s all right . If there ’s anything you wanted to tell me---- ”
31613	31639	31576	31576	she	895	“ Did I say there was ? I just came out to meet you -- I wanted to know if you ’d had good sport . ”
31647	31680	31681	31681	They	911	“ None at all . The fact is I did n’t try . Jean and I have just been knocking about in the woods . I was n’t in a sanguinary mood . ”
31721	31734	31735	31738	her step - son	719	“ You DID say there was something you wanted to tell me , ”
31744	31750	31751	31751	She	97	“ Well , there is . ”
31772	31777	31778	31778	he	910	“ Is Darrow coming ? ”
31801	31823	31795	31795	She	97	“ Yes : he ’s coming . I ’ve just heard . He arrives to - morrow . But that ’s not---- ”
31834	31853	31824	31824	She	97	“ Or rather , yes , in a way it is my reason for wanting to speak to you---- ”
31854	31860	31879	31879	He	910	“ Because he ’s coming ? ”
31861	31869	31824	31824	She	97	“ Because he ’s not yet here . ”
31870	31878	31879	31879	He	910	“ It ’s about him , then ? ”
31897	31921	31894	31894	his	910	“ About---- ? No , no : I meant that I wanted to speak today because it ’s our last day alone together . ”
31922	31928	31929	31929	He	910	“ Oh , I see . ”
31971	31973	31974	31974	He	910	“ Owen---- ”
31981	31995	31974	31974	He	910	“ Look here , my dear , it ’s no sort of use . ”
31996	32002	31974	31974	He	910	“ What ’s no use ? ”
32003	32014	32015	32015	She	97	“ Anything on earth you can any of you say . ”
32019	32030	32015	32015	She	97	“ Am I one of ‘ any of you ’ ? ”
32036	32050	32015	32015	She	97	“ Well , then -- anything on earth that even YOU can say . ”
32051	32070	31974	31974	He	910	“ You do n’t in the least know what I can say -- or what I mean to . ”
32071	32078	32079	32079	She	97	“ Do n’t I , generally ? ”
32091	32113	32114	32114	He	910	“ Yes ; but this is particularly . I want to say ... Owen , you ’ve been admirable all through . ”
32132	32135	32136	32136	she	97	“ Admirable , ”
32139	32145	32136	32136	she	97	“ And so has SHE . ”
32146	32156	32157	32157	His	910	“ Oh , and so have you to HER ! ”
32164	32186	32187	32187	he	910	“ I ’ve never lost sight of that for a minute . It ’s been altogether easier for her , though , ”
32192	32203	32204	32204	she	97	“ On the whole , I suppose it has . Well---- ”
32211	32230	32204	32204	she	97	“ are n’t you all the better pleased to be told you ’ve behaved as well as she ? ”
32231	32245	32246	32246	he	910	“ Oh , you know , I ’ve not done it for you , ”
32266	32289	32246	32246	he	910	“ Have n’t you , though , perhaps -- the least bit ? Because , after all , you knew I understood ? ”
32290	32300	32301	32301	She	97	“ You ’ve been awfully kind about pretending to . ”
32304	32321	32301	32301	She	97	“ You do n’t believe me ? You must remember I had your grandmother to consider . ”
32322	32342	32343	32343	He	910	“ Yes : and my father -- and Effie , I suppose -- and the outraged shades of Givre ! ”
32357	32368	32343	32343	He	910	“ Do you likewise include the late Monsieur de Chantelle ? ”
32393	32437	32381	32381	She	233	“ Yes : I must have seemed to you too subject to Givre . Perhaps I have been . But you know that was not my real object in asking you to wait , to say nothing to your grandmother before her return . ”
32441	32454	32381	32381	She	233	“ Your real object , of course , was to gain time . ”
32455	32467	32381	32381	She	233	“ Yes -- but for whom ? Why not for YOU ? ”
32468	32472	32473	32473	He	910	“ For me ? ”
32478	32484	32473	32473	He	910	“ You do n’t mean---- ? ”
32500	32516	32487	32487	her	233	“ I mean that when your grandmother gets back from Ouchy I shall speak to her---- ”
32517	32525	32381	32381	She	233	“ You ’ll speak to her ... ? ”
32526	32538	32487	32487	her	233	“ Yes ; if only you ’ll promise to give me time---- ”
32539	32549	32487	32487	her	233	“ Time for her to send for Adelaide Painter ? ”
32550	32561	32381	32381	She	233	“ Oh , she ’ll undoubtedly send for Adelaide Painter ! ”
32581	32601	32575	32575	they	915	“ Only you must promise not to rush things . You must give me time to prepare Adelaide too , ”
32607	32612	32613	32613	He	916	“ Prepare her too ? ”
32623	32629	32613	32613	He	916	“ Prepare her for what ? ”
32630	32660	32661	32661	His	916	“ Why , to prepare your grandmother ! For your marriage . Yes , that ’s what I mean . I ’m going to see you through , you know---- ”
32673	32685	32668	32668	he	916	“ Oh , you dear divine thing ! I did n’t dream---- ”
32686	32693	32694	32694	She	75	“ I know you did n’t . ”
32705	32773	32694	32694	She	75	“ I ca n’t say you ’ve convinced me of the wisdom of the step . Only I seem to see that other things matter more -- and that not missing things matters most . Perhaps I ’ve changed -- or YOUR not changing has convinced me . I ’m certain now that you wo n’t budge . And that was really all I ever cared about . ”
32774	32808	32668	32668	he	916	“ Oh , as to not budging -- I told you so months ago : you might have been sure of that ! And how can you be any surer today than yesterday ? ”
32809	32822	32694	32694	She	75	“ I do n’t know . I suppose one learns something every day---- ”
32823	32828	32829	32829	he	917	“ Not at Givre ! ”
32842	32869	32829	32829	he	917	“ But you have n’t really BEEN at Givre lately -- not for months ! Do n’t you suppose I ’ve noticed that , my dear ? ”
32882	32886	32870	32870	She	75	“ Poor Givre ... ”
32887	32916	32917	32917	They	918	“ Poor empty Givre ! With so many rooms full and yet not a soul in it -- except of course my grandmother , who is its soul ! ”
32947	32956	32957	32957	she	75	“ It looks so made to be happy in---- ”
32960	32967	32957	32957	she	75	“ Yes -- today , today ! ”
32975	32990	32991	32991	He	917	“ Oh , you darling -- to have given it that look for me ! ”
33003	33076	32991	32991	He	917	“ Do n’t you feel we owe it to the poor old place to do what we can to give it that look ? You , too , I mean ? Come , let ’s make it grin from wing to wing ! I ’ve such a mad desire to say outrageous things to it -- haven’t you ? After all , in old times there must have been living people here ! ”
33114	33119	33120	33120	she	75	“ It IS beautiful , ”
33123	33149	33120	33120	she	75	“ A beautiful memory ! Quite perfect to take out and turn over when I ’m grinding at the law in New York , and you’re---- ”
33162	33205	33206	33206	She	75	“ Come ! Tell me . You and I do n’t have to say things to talk to each other . When you turn suddenly absentminded and mysterious I always feel like saying : ‘ Come back . All is discovered ’ . ”
33211	33225	33206	33206	She	75	“ You know as much as I know . I promise you that . ”
33242	33255	33256	33256	he	917	“ I do n’t know Darrow as much as you know him , ”
33265	33277	33260	33260	She	75	“ You said just now we did n’t need to say things ”
33278	33289	33290	33290	He	917	“ Was I speaking ? I thought it was your eyes---- ”
33315	33357	33290	33290	He	917	“ They ’re such awfully conversational eyes ! Do n’t you suppose they told me long ago why it ’s just today you ’ve made up your mind that people have got to live their own lives -- even at Givre ? ”
33359	33366	33367	33367	Anna	97	“ This is the south terrace , ”
33370	33381	33367	33367	Anna	97	“ Should you like to walk down to the river ? ”
33953	33964	33965	33965	They	935	“ Yes , let us walk down to the river . ”
34122	34130	34131	34131	Darrow	71	“ It ’s good to be here , ”
34270	34282	34283	34283	They	935	“ And this is where you ’ve been all these years . ”
34521	34531	34516	34516	he	71	“ There are to be no more obstacles now . ”
34532	34535	34516	34516	he	71	“ Obstacles ? ”
34541	34545	34516	34516	he	71	“ What obstacles ? ”
34546	34594	34516	34516	he	71	“ Do n’t you remember the wording of the telegram that turned me back last May ? ‘ Unforeseen obstacle ’ : that was it . What was the earth - shaking problem , by the way ? Finding a governess for Effie , was n’t it ? ”
34595	34618	34516	34516	he	71	“ But I gave you my reason : the reason why it was an obstacle . I wrote you fully about it . ”
34619	34627	34628	34628	He	71	“ Yes , I know you did . ”
34636	34652	34628	34628	He	71	“ How far off it all seems , and how little it all matters today ! ”
34659	34690	34653	34653	She	97	“ Do you feel that ? I suppose I ’m different . I want to draw all those wasted months into today -- to make them a part of it . ”
34691	34714	34715	34715	She	97	“ But they are , to me . You reach back and take everything -- back to the first days of all . ”
34728	34751	34715	34715	She	97	“ It ’s curious how , in those first days , too , something that I did n’t understand came between us . ”
34752	34780	34653	34653	She	97	“ Oh , in those days we neither of us understood , did we ? It ’s part of what ’s called the bliss of being young . ”
34781	34820	34863	34863	she	97	“ Yes , I thought that , too : thought it , I mean , in looking back . But it could n’t , even then , have been as true of you as of me ; and now---- ”
34821	34824	34825	34825	he	71	“ Now , ”
34828	34842	34843	34843	He	71	“ the only thing that matters is that we ’re sitting here together . ”
34920	34928	34940	34940	his	71	“ Between you and me everything matters . ”
34929	34933	34940	34940	his	71	“ Of course ! ”
34943	34948	34949	34949	he	71	“ That ’s why , ”
34953	34975	34949	34949	he	71	“ ‘ everything , ’ for me , is here and now : on this bench , between you and me . ”
34982	35003	34949	34949	he	71	“ That ’s what I meant : it ’s here and now ; we ca n’t get away from it . ”
35004	35017	35018	35018	Her	97	“ Get away from it ? Do you want to ? AGAIN ? ”
35072	35087	35088	35088	She	97	“ ‘ Again ’ ? But was n’t it YOU , the last time---- ? ”
35118	35154	35158	35158	he	71	“ The last time ? Last spring ? But it was you who -- for the best of reasons , as you ’ve told me -- turned me back from your very door last spring ! ”
35165	35169	35158	35158	he	71	“ thresh out , ”
35199	35208	35209	35209	she	97	“ I wrote as soon as I could , ”
35212	35231	35209	35209	she	97	“ I explained the delay and asked you to come . And you never even answered my letter . ”
35232	35249	35158	35158	he	71	“ It was impossible to come then . I had to go back to my post . ”
35250	35260	35320	35320	Her	97	“ And impossible to write and tell me so ? ”
35261	35301	35209	35209	she	97	“ Your letter was a long time coming . I had waited a week -- ten days . I had some excuse for thinking , when it came , that you were in no great hurry for an answer . ”
35302	35313	35158	35158	he	71	“ You thought that -- really -- after reading it ? ”
35314	35319	35320	35320	Her	97	“ I thought it . ”
35328	35336	35337	35337	He	965	“ Then why are you here today ? ”
35348	35359	35337	35337	He	965	“ God knows -- if you can ask me that ! ”
35360	35373	35374	35374	He	965	“ You see I was right to say I did n’t understand . ”
35394	35402	35374	35374	He	965	“ Perhaps I might say so too . ”
35403	35421	35422	35422	She	97	“ No , no : we must neither of us have any reason for saying it again . ”
35428	35474	35422	35422	She	97	“ Surely you and I need n’t arrange the lights before we show ourselves to each other . I want you to see me just as I am , with all my irrational doubts and scruples ; the old ones and the new ones too . ”
35484	35572	35475	35475	He	965	“ Never mind the old ones . They were justified -- I’m willing to admit it . With the governess having suddenly to be packed off , and Effie on your hands , and your mother - in - law ill , I see the impossibility of your letting me come . I even see that , at the moment , it was difficult to write and explain . But what does all that matter now ? The new scruples are the ones I want to tackle . ”
35643	35666	35684	35684	She	97	“ You did n’t come , and you did n’t answer my letter ; and after waiting four months I wrote another . ”
35667	35679	35684	35684	She	97	“ And I answered that one ; and I ’m here . ”
35680	35683	35684	35684	She	97	“ Yes . ”
35689	35750	35684	35684	She	97	“ But in my last letter I repeated exactly what I ’d said in the first -- the one I wrote you last June . I told you then that I was ready to give you the answer to what you ’d asked me in London ; and in telling you that , I told you what the answer was . ”
35751	35758	35759	35759	Darrow	71	“ My dearest ! My dearest ! ”
35762	35790	35759	35759	Darrow	71	“ You ignored that letter . All summer you made no sign . And all I ask now is , that you should frankly tell me why . ”
35791	35873	35684	35684	She	97	“ I can only repeat what I ’ve just said . I was hurt and unhappy and I doubted you . I suppose if I ’d cared less I should have been more confident . I cared so much that I could n’t risk another failure . For you ’d made me feel that I ’d miserably failed . So I shut my eyes and set my teeth and turned my back . There ’s the whole pusillanimous truth of it ! ”
35874	35883	35884	35884	She	970	“ Oh , if it ’s the WHOLE truth!---- ”
35890	35925	35884	35884	She	970	“ There ’s my torment , you see . I thought that was what your silence meant till I made you break it . Now I want to be sure that I was right . ”
35926	35937	35975	35975	him	971	“ What can I tell you to make you sure ? ”
35938	35948	35949	35949	She	970	“ You can let me tell YOU everything first . ”
35961	35968	35969	35969	she	970	“ Owen saw you in Paris , ”
36027	36039	36002	36002	She	970	“ In Paris ? Oh , yes ... So he did . ”
36040	36090	36198	36198	He	972	“ He came back and told me . I think you talked to him a moment in a theatre . I asked if you ’d spoken of my having put you off -- or if you ’d sent me any message . He did n’t remember that you had . ”
36091	36104	36198	36198	He	972	“ In a crush -- in a Paris foyer ? My dear ! ”
36105	36197	36198	36198	He	972	“ It was absurd of me ! But Owen and I have always been on odd kind of brother - and - sister terms . I think he guessed about us when he saw you with me in London . So he teased me a little and tried to make me curious about you ; and when he saw he ’d succeeded he told me he had n’t had time to say much to you because you were in such a hurry to get back to the lady you were with . ”
36233	36244	36223	36223	He	972	“ Yes : and what else did he tell you ? ”
36245	36317	36318	36318	Darrow	71	“ Oh , not much , except that she was awfully pretty . When I asked him to describe her he said you had her tucked away in a baignoire and he had n’t actually seen her ; but he saw the tail of her cloak , and somehow knew from that that she was pretty . One DOES , you know ... I think he said the cloak was pink . ”
36324	36344	36318	36318	Darrow	71	“ Of course it was -- they always are ! So that was at the bottom of your doubts ? ”
36345	36371	36372	36372	she	974	“ Not at first . I only laughed . But afterward , when I wrote you and you did n’t answer----Oh , you DO see ? ”
36384	36390	36377	36377	He	71	“ Yes : I see . ”
36391	36432	36433	36433	He	71	“ It ’s not as if this were a light thing between us . I want you to know me as I am . If I thought that at that moment ... when you were on your way here , almost---- ”
36441	36449	36433	36433	He	71	“ Yes , yes -- I understand . ”
36450	36455	36456	36456	Her	974	“ But do you ? ”
36461	36553	36456	36456	Her	974	“ I ’m not a goose of a girl . I know ... of course I KNOW ... but there are things a woman feels ... when what she knows does n’t make any difference . It ’s not that I want you to explain -- I mean about that particular evening . It ’s only that I want you to have the whole of my feeling . I did n’t know what it was till I saw you again . I never dreamed I should say such things to you ! ”
36554	36568	36569	36569	He	975	“ I never dreamed I should be here to hear you say them ! ”
36586	36599	36600	36600	he	975	“ But now that you have , I know -- I know , ”
36606	36610	36600	36600	he	975	“ You know ? ”
36611	36639	36581	36581	his	975	“ That this is no light thing between us . Now you may ask me anything you please ! That was all I wanted to ask YOU . ”
37231	37251	37213	37213	his	71	“ You ’re sure you ’re prepared to give up Givre ? You look so made for each other ! ”
37252	37256	37257	37257	She	97	“ Oh , Givre---- ”
37290	37302	37287	37287	she	97	“ When Owen marries I shall have to give it up . ”
37303	37328	37329	37329	She	97	“ When Owen marries ? That ’s looking some distance ahead ! I want to be told that meanwhile you ’ll have no regrets . ”
37368	37384	37385	37385	She	97	“ There will probably be no ‘ meanwhile . ’ Owen may marry before long . ”
37444	37482	37432	37432	she	97	“ Owen marry ? Why , he always seems like a faun in flannels ! I hope he ’s found a dryad . There might easily be one left in these blue - and - gold woods . ”
37483	37523	37569	37569	She	97	“ I ca n’t tell you yet where he found his dryad , but she IS one , I believe : at any rate she ’ll become the Givre woods better than I do . Only there may be difficulties---- ”
37524	37539	37540	37540	She	97	“ Well ! At that age they ’re not always to be wished away . ”
37543	37568	37569	37569	She	97	“ Owen , at any rate , has made up his mind to overcome them ; and I ’ve promised to see him through . ”
37603	37638	37569	37569	She	97	“ She must be prepared for it , and I ’ve promised to do the preparing . You know I always HAVE seen him through things , and he rather counts on me now . ”
37668	37704	37705	37705	He	71	“ But once Owen ’s future is settled , you wo n’t , surely , for the sake of what you call seeing him through , ask that I should go away again without you ? ”
37713	37762	37705	37705	He	71	“ Owen will understand , if you do n’t . Since he ’s in the same case himself I ’ll throw myself on his mercy . He ’ll see that I have the first claim on you ; he wo n’t even want you not to see it . ”
37763	37816	37657	37657	he	71	“ Owen sees everything : I ’m not afraid of that . But his future is n’t settled . He ’s very young to marry -- too young , his grandmother is sure to think -- and the marriage he wants to make is not likely to convince her to the contrary . ”
37817	37830	37657	37657	he	71	“ You do n’t mean that it ’s like his first choice ? ”
37831	37861	37705	37705	He	71	“ Oh , no ! But it ’s not what Madame de Chantelle would call a good match ; it ’s not even what I call a wise one . ”
37862	37870	37657	37657	he	71	“ Yet you ’re backing him up ? ”
37871	37879	37880	37880	She	993	“ Yet I ’m backing him up . ”
37883	38010	37880	37880	She	993	“ I wonder if you ’ll understand ? What I ’ve most wanted for him , and shall want for Effie , is that they shall always feel free to make their own mistakes , and never , if possible , be persuaded to make other people ’s . Even if Owen ’s marriage is a mistake , and has to be paid for , I believe he ’ll learn and grow in the paying . Of course I ca n’t make Madame de Chantelle see this ; but I can remind her that , with his character -- his big rushes of impulse , his odd intervals of ebb and apathy -- she may drive him into some worse blunder if she thwarts him now . ”
38011	38030	37657	37657	he	71	“ And you mean to break the news to her as soon as she comes back from Ouchy ? ”
38031	38235	38236	38236	She	994	“ As soon as I see my way to it . She knows the girl and likes her : that ’s our hope . And yet it may , in the end , prove our danger , make it harder for us all , when she learns the truth , than if Owen had chosen a stranger . I ca n’t tell you more till I ’ve told her : I ’ve promised Owen not to tell any one . All I ask you is to give me time , to give me a few days at any rate She ’s been wonderfully ‘ nice , ’ as she would call it , about you , and about the fact of my having soon to leave Givre ; but that , again , may make it harder for Owen . At any rate , you can see , ca n’t you , how it makes me want to stand by him ? You see , I could n’t bear it if the least fraction of my happiness seemed to be stolen from his -- as if it were a little scrap of happiness that had to be pieced out with other people ’s ! ”
38245	38273	38236	38236	She	994	“ I want our life to be like a house with all the windows lit : I ’d like to string lanterns from the roof and chimneys ! ”
38513	38543	38508	38508	She	994	“ He does n’t care what I say -- it ’s enough that I say it -- even if it ’s stupid he ’ll like me better for it ... ”
38804	38818	38819	38819	She	994	“ From Owen ! He must have rushed off somewhere in the motor . ”
38851	38854	38855	38855	Owen	75	“ Dear , ”
38858	38915	38855	38855	Owen	75	“ after what you said yesterday I ca n’t wait another hour , and I ’m off to Francheuil , to catch the Dijon express and travel back with them . Do n’t be frightened ; I wo n’t speak unless it ’s safe to . Trust me for that -- but I had to go . ”
38921	38943	38916	38916	She	994	“ He ’s gone to Dijon to meet his grandmother . Oh , I hope I have n’t made a mistake ! ”
38944	38960	38961	38961	She	994	“ You ? Why , what have you to do with his going to Dijon ? ”
38964	39033	38961	38961	She	994	“ The day before yesterday I told him , for the first time , that I meant to see him through , no matter what happened . And I ’m afraid he ’s lost his head , and will be imprudent and spoil things . You see , I had n’t meant to say a word to him till I ’d had time to prepare Madame de Chantelle . ”
39055	39089	39037	39037	Darrow	71	“ Yes : it was when I heard you were coming that I told him . I wanted him to feel as I felt ... it seemed too unkind to make him wait ! ”
39107	39119	39097	39097	his	71	“ It WOULD have been too unkind to make him wait . ”
39169	39183	39158	39158	She	994	“ It ’s nearly luncheon time -- I must take off my hat ... ”
39347	39355	39356	39356	she	994	“ If I look like this today , ”
39361	39375	39356	39356	she	994	“ what will he think of me when I ’m ill or worried ? ”
39405	39416	39417	39417	she	994	“ I want him to see me as I am , ”
40384	40393	40375	40375	he	71	“ You must n’t stay till you ’re chilled ”
40421	40428	40418	40418	she	1036	“ It must be after eleven , ”
40452	40458	40459	40459	she	1036	“ There ’ll be evenings and evenings”--till
40476	40480	40459	40459	she	1036	“ Good night . ”
40493	40497	40498	40498	he	71	“ Good night , ”
40582	40585	40563	40563	He	71	“ all the difference”
40600	40604	40587	40587	He	71	“ take a line ”
40732	40735	40717	40718	a comrade	1049	“ doing something ”

41431	41440	41459	41459	He	71	“ She ’s a woman to be proud of ”
41492	41498	41499	41499	he	71	“ Oh , hang it , ”
41503	41518	41499	41499	he	71	“ it ’s the best thing that ’s ever happened to me , anyhow ! ”
41637	41645	41646	41646	he	71	“ The old delusion , I suppose , ”
41651	41660	41646	41646	he	71	“ Will Nature never tire of the trick ? ”
41697	41710	41711	41711	he	71	“ How I should like her if I did n’t love her ! ”
42059	42233	42038	42040	Madame de Chantelle	111	“ She has enjoyed her month at Ouchy , and it has given her a lot to talk about -- her symptoms , and the rival doctors , and the people at the hotel . It seems she met your Ambassadress there , and Lady Wantley , and some other London friends of yours , and she ’s heard what she calls ‘ delightful things ’ about you : she told me to tell you so . She attaches great importance to the fact that your grandmother was an Everard of Albany . She ’s prepared to open her arms to you . I do n’t know whether it wo n’t make it harder for poor Owen ... the contrast , I mean ... There are no Ambassadresses or Everards to vouch for HIS choice ! But you ’ll help me , wo n’t you ? You ’ll help me to help him ? To - morrow I ’ll tell you the rest . Now I must rush up and tuck in Effie ... ”
42234	42249	42250	42250	he	1086	“ Oh , you ’ll see , we ’ll pull it off for him ! ”
42254	42266	42250	42250	he	1086	“ together , we ca n’t fail to pull it off . ”
42455	42459	42468	42468	Darrow	71	“ still - life ”

42809	42894	42896	42896	She	111	“ There are charming people everywhere ... and one must always look on the best side ... but when one has lived among Traditions it ’s difficult to adapt one ’s self to the new ideas ... These dreadful views of marriage ... it ’s so hard to explain them to my French relations ... I’m thankful to say I do n’t pretend to understand them myself ! But YOU’RE an Everard -- I told Anna last spring in London that one sees that instantly ”
42939	42987	42988	42988	She	111	“ I don t know , of course ; but people say it ’s owing to the Americans . Certainly my waiter had a way of slapping down the dishes ... they tell me that many of them are Anarchists ... belong to Unions , you know . ”
43437	43460	43462	43462	she	111	“ Brilliant diplomatic society ... social advantages ... the entree everywhere ... nothing else FORMS a young man in the same way ... ”

43672	43830	43655	43655	she	111	“ Effie ’s a perfect child . She ’s more like my son , perhaps , than dear Owen . She ’ll never intentionally give me the least trouble . But of course the responsibility will be great ... I’m not sure I should dare to undertake it if it were not for her having such a treasure of a governess . Has Anna told you about our little governess ? After all the worry we had last year , with one impossible creature after another , it seems providential , just now , to have found her . At first we were afraid she was too young ; but now we ’ve the greatest confidence in her . So clever and amusing -- and SUCH a lady ! I do n’t say her education ’s all it might be ... no drawing or singing ... but one ca n’t have everything ; and she speaks Italian ... ”
44037	44039	44036	44036	her	858	“ pretty ”
44206	44209	44210	44210	he	71	“ Yes , ”
44214	44253	44254	44254	Anna	67	“ she ’s exquisite ... Oh , I see what I ’m asking of you ! But she ’ll be quite happy here , wo n’t she ? And you must remember it wo n’t be for long ... ”
44259	44352	44254	44254	Anna	67	“ Oh , she ’ll be happy here . It ’s her nature to be happy . She ’ll apply herself to it , conscientiously , as she does to her lessons , and to what she calls ‘ being good’ ... In a way , you see , that ’s just what worries me . Her idea of ‘ being good ’ is to please the person she ’s with -- she puts her whole dear little mind on it ! And so , if ever she ’s with the wrong person---- ”
44353	44382	44383	44383	Anna	67	“ But surely there ’s no danger of that just now ? Madame de Chantelle tells me that you ’ve at last put your hand on a perfect governess---- ”
44396	44405	44406	44406	Darrow	71	“ It ’s lucky , at any rate , ”
44409	44418	44406	44406	Darrow	71	“ that Madame de Chantelle thinks her so . ”
44419	44430	44383	44383	Anna	67	“ Oh , I think very highly of her too . ”
44431	44444	44383	44383	Anna	67	“ Highly enough to feel quite satisfied to leave her with Effie ? ”
44445	44481	44485	44485	she	67	“ Yes . She ’s just the person for Effie . Only , of course , one never knows ... She ’s young , and she might take it into her head to leave us ... ”
44488	44501	44485	44485	she	67	“ I ’m naturally anxious to know what you think of her . ”
44645	44654	44655	44655	she	74	“ Here he is ! Here he is ! ”
44709	44714	44715	44715	Effie	74	“ HERE he is ! ”

44930	44936	44927	44927	She	1160	“ How do you do ? ”
44992	45007	44982	44982	Anna	67	“ Has Owen introduced you ? This is Effie ’s friend , Miss Viner . ”
45051	45068	45032	45032	her	82	“ I think Miss Viner and I have met already -- several years ago in London . ”
45069	45073	45075	45076	Sophy Viner	81	“ I remember , ”
45084	45100	45102	45103	Mrs. Leath	75	“ How charming ! Then we ’re all friends . But luncheon must be ready , ”
45287	45297	45298	45298	she	67	“ I ’d no idea you knew Miss Viner , ”
45310	45357	45298	45298	she	67	“ It came back to me , luckily , that I ’d seen her two or three times in London , several years ago . She was secretary , or something of the sort , in the background of a house where I used to dine . ”
45422	45455	45415	45415	Anna	67	“ Was she really ? You must tell me all about it -- tell me exactly how she struck you . I ’m so glad it turns out that you know her . ”
45456	45474	45475	45477	Madame de Chantelle	111	“ ‘ Know ’ is rather exaggerated : we used to pass each other on the stairs . ”
45496	45513	45487	45487	Anna	67	“ You ’ll tell me about that , then . Try and remember everything you can . ”

45889	46037	45886	45886	him	133	“ to drift into what my grandmother , poor dear , is trying to make of me : an adjunct of Givre . I do n’t want -- hang it all!--to slip into collecting sensations as my father collected snuff - boxes . I want Effie to have Givre -- it ’s my grandmother ’s , you know , to do as she likes with ; and I ’ve understood lately that if it belonged to me it would gradually gobble me up . I want to get out of it , into a life that ’s big and ugly and struggling . If I can extract beauty out of THAT , so much the better : that ’ll prove my vocation . But I want to MAKE beauty , not be drowned in the ready - made , like a bee in a pot of honey . ”
46140	46150	46102	46102	Owen	75	“ What in God ’s name shall I do ? ”
46506	46591	46592	46592	Darrow	71	“ I was coming out to meet you -- you and Owen . Miss Viner was coming , too , and then she could n’t because she ’s got such a headache . I ’m afraid I gave it to her because I did my division so disgracefully . It ’s too bad , is n’t it ? But wo n’t you walk back with me ? Nurse wo n’t mind the least bit ; she ’d so much rather go in to tea . ”
46623	46647	46648	46648	She	1200	“ Oh , then you can go and write them in Owen ’s study . That ’s where gentlemen always write their letters . ”

47251	47263	47264	47264	he	71	“ Do sit down -- I want to talk to you , ”
47319	47332	47333	47333	he	71	“ You promised to let me hear from you now and then , ”
47355	47376	47377	47377	He	71	“ Did I ? There was nothing to tell . I ’ve had no history -- like the happy countries ... ”
47384	47390	47377	47377	He	71	“ You ARE happy here ? ”
47391	47395	47396	47396	she	81	“ I WAS , ”
47403	47428	47396	47396	she	81	“ Why do you say ‘ was ’ ? You ’re surely not thinking of going ? There ca n’t be kinder people anywhere . ”
47447	47460	47438	47438	her	81	“ I suppose it depends on you whether I go or stay . ”
47461	47465	47466	47466	He	71	“ On me ? ”
47476	47491	47466	47466	He	71	“ Good God ! What can you think of me , to say that ? ”
47534	47547	47526	47526	she	81	“ Do n’t imagine I ’m the least bit sorry for anything ! ”
47618	47629	47609	47609	He	71	“ You ’ve been here , then , ever since ? ”
47630	47654	47655	47655	She	81	“ Since June ; yes . It turned out that the Farlows were hunting for me -- all the while -- for this . ”
47715	47731	47702	47702	he	71	“ Your idea of the theatre -- you gave that up at once , then ? ”
47732	47738	47739	47739	She	81	“ Oh , the theatre ! ”
47745	47768	47739	47739	She	81	“ I could n’t wait for the theatre . I had to take the first thing that offered ; I took this . ”
47774	47840	47769	47769	He	71	“ I ’m glad -- extremely glad -- you’re happy here ... I’d counted on your letting me know if there was anything I could do ... The theatre , now -- if you still regret it -- if you ’re not contented here ... I know people in that line in London -- I’m certain I can manage it for you when I get back---- ”
47864	47877	47841	47841	She	1221	“ Then you DO want me to leave ? Is that it ? ”
47886	47945	47948	47948	him	1222	“ Good heavens ! How can you think such things ? At the time , you know , I begged you to let me do what I could , but you would n’t hear of it ... and ever since I ’ve been wanting to be of use -- to do something , anything , to help you ... ”
47969	47987	47988	47988	she	1221	“ If you want to help me , then -- you can help me to stay here , ”
48439	48443	48422	48422	she	297	“ have it out ”
48477	48484	48485	48485	he	1222	“ Poor thing ... poor thing ! ”
49177	49219	49168	49168	Effie	74	“ Oh , Owen , where in the world have you been ? I walked miles and miles with Nurse and could n’t find you , and we met Jean and he said he did n’t know where you ’d gone . ”
49220	49243	49244	49244	he	1125	“ Nobody knows where I go , or what I see when I get there -- that ’s the beauty of it ! ”
49250	49257	49258	49258	he	1125	“ But if you ’re good , ”
49261	49273	49258	49258	he	1125	“ I ’ll tell you about it one of these days . ”
49274	49299	49258	49258	he	1125	“ Oh , now , Owen , now ! I do n’t really believe I ’ll ever be much better than I am now . ”
49300	49308	49309	49310	her mother	221	“ Let Owen have his tea first , ”
49397	49403	49404	49404	he	1125	“ Where ’s Miss Viner ? ”
49414	49427	49404	49404	he	1125	“ Why is n’t she here to chain up this ungovernable infant ? ”
49428	49462	49408	49408	Effie	74	“ Poor Miss Viner has a headache . Effie says she went to her room as soon as lessons were over , and sent word that she would n’t be down for tea . ”
49463	49466	49468	49468	Owen	75	“ Ah , ”
49563	49577	49578	49578	she	74	“ Stop a minute in my sitting - room on your way up , ”
49709	49720	49721	49721	he	71	“ She will want to ask me about the girl , ”
49888	49899	49900	49900	he	71	“ It ’s just like you -- it is you , ”
49911	49938	49900	49900	he	71	“ It ’s a good place to be alone in -- I do n’t think I ’ve ever before cared to talk with any one here . ”
49939	49955	49904	49904	his	71	“ Let ’s be quiet , then : it ’s the best way of talking . ”
49956	49979	49980	49980	He	71	“ Yes ; but we must save it up till later . There are things I want to say to you now . ”
49987	49998	49980	49980	He	71	“ Say them , then , and I ’ll listen . ”
49999	50014	49904	49904	his	71	“ Oh , no . I want you to tell me about Miss Viner . ”
50015	50020	50021	50021	He	71	“ About Miss Viner ? ”
50039	50046	50047	50047	she	67	“ It ’s important , naturally , ”
50050	50065	50047	50047	she	67	“ that I should find out all I can about her before I leave . ”
50066	50073	49904	49904	his	71	“ Important on Effie ’s account ? ”
50074	50083	49904	49904	his	71	“ On Effie ’s account -- of course . ”
50084	50101	50047	50047	she	67	“ Of course ... But you ’ve every reason to be satisfied , have n’t you ? ”
50102	50176	49904	49904	his	71	“ Every apparent reason . We all like her . Effie ’s very fond of her , and she seems to have a delightful influence on the child . But we know so little , after all -- about her antecedents , I mean , and her past history . That ’s why I want you to try and recall everything you heard about her when you used to see her in London . ”
50177	50223	49904	49904	his	71	“ Oh , on that score I ’m afraid I sha’n’t be of much use . As I told you , she was a mere shadow in the background of the house I saw her in -- and that was four or five years ago ... ”
50224	50233	50047	50047	she	67	“ When she was with a Mrs. Murrett ? ”
50234	50306	49904	49904	his	71	“ Yes ; an appalling woman who runs a roaring dinner - factory that used now and then to catch me in its wheels . I escaped from them long ago ; but in my time there used to be half a dozen fagged ‘ hands ’ to tend the machine , and Miss Viner was one of them . I ’m glad she ’s out of it , poor girl ! ”
50307	50318	49904	49904	his	71	“ Then you never really saw anything of her there ? ”
50319	50338	50047	50047	she	67	“ I never had the chance . Mrs. Murrett discouraged any competition on the part of her subordinates . ”
50339	50348	49904	49904	his	71	“ Especially such pretty ones , I suppose ? ”
50358	50382	50355	50355	she	1261	“ And Mrs. Murrett ’s own opinion -- if she ’d offered you one -- probably would n’t have been of much value ? ”
50383	50409	50410	50410	he	71	“ Only in so far as her disapproval would , on general principles , have been a good mark for Miss Viner . But surely , ”
50417	50436	50410	50410	he	71	“ you could have found out about her from the people through whom you first heard of her ? ”
50440	50451	50437	50437	Anna	67	“ Oh , we heard of her through Adelaide Painter-- ; ”
50595	50705	50706	50706	Darrow	71	“ It ’s all the odder because my mother - in - law , since her second marriage , has lived so much in the country that she ’s practically lost sight of all her other American friends . Besides which , you can see how completely she has identified herself with Monsieur de Chantelle ’s nationality and adopted French habits and prejudices . Yet when anything goes wrong she always sends for Adelaide Painter , who ’s more American than the Stars and Stripes , and might have left South Braintree yesterday , if she had n’t , rather , brought it over with her in her trunk . ”
50709	50721	50706	50706	Darrow	71	“ Well , then , if South Braintree vouches for Miss Viner---- ”
50722	50920	50548	50548	she	1262	“ Oh , but only indirectly . When we had that odious adventure with Mademoiselle Grumeau , who ’d been so highly recommended by Monsieur de Chantelle ’s aunt , the Chanoinesse , Adelaide was of course sent for , and she said at once : ‘ I ’m not the least bit surprised . I ’ve always told you that what you wanted for Effie was a sweet American girl , and not one of these nasty foreigners . ’ Unluckily she could n’t , at the moment , put her hand on a sweet American ; but she presently heard of Miss Viner through the Farlows , an excellent couple who live in the Quartier Latin and write about French life for the American papers . I was only too thankful to find anyone who was vouched for by decent people ; and so far I ’ve had no cause to regret my choice . But I know , after all , very little about Miss Viner ; and there are all kinds of reasons why I want , as soon as possible , to find out more -- to find out all I can . ”
50921	50958	50706	50706	Darrow	71	“ Since you ’ve got to leave Effie I understand your feeling in that way . But is there , in such a case , any recommendation worth half as much as your own direct experience ? ”
50959	51012	50548	50548	she	1262	“ No ; and it ’s been so favourable that I was ready to accept it as conclusive . Only , naturally , when I found you ’d known her in London I was in hopes you ’d give me some more specific reasons for liking her as much as I do . ”
51013	51038	50548	50548	she	1262	“ I ’m afraid I can give you nothing more specific than my general vague impression that she seems very plucky and extremely nice . ”
51039	51055	50706	50706	Darrow	71	“ You do n’t , at any rate , know anything specific to the contrary ? ”
51056	51103	50548	50548	she	1262	“ To the contrary ? How should I ? I ’m not conscious of ever having heard any one say two words about her . I only infer that she must have pluck and character to have stuck it out so long at Mrs. Murrett ’s . ”
51104	51130	51131	51131	Anna	67	“ Yes , poor thing ! She has pluck , certainly ; and pride , too ; which must have made it all the harder . ”
51137	51164	51165	51165	He	1270	“ You do n’t know how glad I am that your impression ’s on the whole so good . I particularly wanted you to like her . ”
51174	51187	51165	51165	He	1270	“ On that condition I ’m prepared to love even Adelaide Painter . ”
51188	51212	51236	51236	he	1270	“ I almost hope you wo nt have the chance to -- poor Adelaide ! Her appearance here always coincides with a catastrophe . ”
51213	51225	51226	51226	He	1270	“ Oh , then I must manage to meet her elsewhere . ”
51245	51257	51258	51258	he	1270	“ What does anything matter but just THIS?--Must I go now ? ”
51266	51273	51262	51262	She	67	“ It must be time to dress ”
51289	51299	51300	51300	she	67	“ My love -- oh , my dear love ! ”
51375	51379	51380	51380	Anna	67	“ Come in ! ”
51398	51406	51407	51407	Anna	67	“ Do come in , Miss Viner , ”
51431	51465	51415	51416	The girl	297	“ I ’m so sorry ; but Effie has mislaid her Latin grammar , and I thought she might have left it here . I need it to prepare for tomorrow ’s lesson . ”
51466	51471	51472	51472	Darrow	71	“ Is this it ? ”
51483	51489	51490	51490	He	71	“ Oh , thank you ! ”
51506	51516	51517	51517	Anna	67	“ Wait a minute , please , Miss Viner , ”
51535	51565	51527	51527	she	297	“ Effie told us you ’d gone to your room with a headache . You must n’t sit up over tomorrow ’s lessons if you do n’t feel well . ”
51571	51602	51527	51527	she	297	“ But you see I have to . Latin ’s one of my weak points , and there ’s generally only one page of this book between me and Effie . ”
51615	51622	51623	51623	she	297	“ Do excuse my disturbing you , ”
51626	51633	51634	51634	Anna	67	“ You did n’t disturb me , ”
51669	51694	51640	51640	she	297	“ You DO look tired . You ’d much better go straight to bed . Effie wo n’t be sorry to skip her Latin . ”
51695	51706	51708	51709	Sophy Viner	81	“ Thank you -- but I ’m really all right , ”
53111	53119	53120	53120	he	71	“ Shall we sit down a minute ? ”
53135	53157	53128	53129	The girl	297	“ I ’m afraid there ’s not much time ; we must be back at lessons at half - past nine . ”
53158	53179	53180	53180	She	297	“ But it ’s barely ten minutes past . Let ’s at least walk a little way toward the river . ”
53199	53204	53205	53205	she	297	“ If you like , ”
53316	53363	53307	53307	he	71	“ I came out to look for you because our talk of yesterday was so unsatisfactory . I want to hear more about you -- about your plans and prospects . I ’ve been wondering ever since why you ’ve so completely given up the theatre . ”
53371	53377	53378	53378	she	297	“ I had to live , ”
53387	53402	53378	53378	she	297	“ I understand perfectly that you should like it here -- for a time . ”
53416	53447	53448	53448	She	297	“ It ’s delightful : you could n’t be better placed . Only I wonder a little at your having so completely given up any idea of a different future . ”
53456	53469	53448	53448	She	297	“ I suppose I ’m less restless than I used to be . ”
53470	53505	53534	53534	She	297	“ It ’s certainly natural that you should be less restless here than at Mrs. Murrett ’s ; yet somehow I do n’t seem to see you permanently given up to forming the young . ”
53506	53533	53534	53534	She	297	“ What -- exactly -- DO you seem to see me permanently given up to ? You know you warned me rather emphatically against the theatre . ”
53566	53587	53588	53588	She	297	“ If I did , it was because you so emphatically refused to let me help you to a start . ”
53594	53604	53588	53588	She	297	“ And you think I may let you now ? ”
53669	53687	53664	53664	He	71	“ If I ’d ever cared a straw for her I should know how to avoid hurting her now”--and
53715	53744	53745	53745	He	71	“ I hope , at any rate , you ’ll listen to my reasons . There ’s been time , on both sides , to think them over since---- ”
53754	53756	53760	53760	he	71	“ since ”
53785	53801	53802	53802	she	297	“ Then I ’m to understand -- definitely -- that you DO renew your offer ? ”
53804	53816	53817	53817	She	297	“ With all my heart ! If you ’ll only let me---- ”
53828	53889	53817	53817	She	297	“ It ’s extremely friendly of you -- I DO believe you mean it as a friend -- but I do n’t quite understand why , finding me , as you say , so well placed here , you should show more anxiety about my future than at a time when I was actually , and rather desperately , adrift . ”
53890	53898	53933	53933	her	297	“ Oh , no , not more ! ”
53899	53925	53926	53926	she	297	“ If you show any at all , it must , at any rate , be for different reasons.--In fact , it can only be , ”
53939	53981	53926	53926	she	297	“ for one of two reasons ; either because you feel you ought to help me , or because , for some reason , you think you owe it to Mrs. Leath to let her know what you know of me . ”
54062	54157	54158	54158	She	81	“ What you suggest about Mrs. Leath is hardly worth answering . As to my reasons for wanting to help you , a good deal depends on the words one uses to define rather indefinite things . It ’s true enough that I want to help you ; but the wish is n’t due to ... to any past kindness on your part , but simply to my own interest in you . Why not put it that our friendship gives me the right to intervene for what I believe to be your benefit ? ”
54187	54197	54198	54198	she	81	“ You ’ve known Mrs. Leath a long time ? ”
54212	54219	54203	54203	He	71	“ A long time -- yes . ”
54220	54230	54172	54172	she	81	“ She told me you were friends -- great friends ”
54231	54234	54235	54235	he	71	“ Yes , ”
54238	54244	54235	54235	he	71	“ we ’re great friends . ”
54245	54269	54270	54270	He	71	“ Then you might naturally feel yourself justified in telling her that you do n’t think I ’m the right person for Effie . ”
54282	54351	54352	54352	She	81	“ I do n’t say you ’d LIKE to do it . You would n’t : you ’d hate it . And the natural alternative would be to try to persuade me that I ’d be better off somewhere else than here . But supposing that failed , and you saw I was determined to stay ? THEN you might think it your duty to tell Mrs. Leath . ”
54363	54374	54375	54375	she	81	“ I should , in your place , I believe , ”
54382	54412	54413	54413	he	71	“ I should n’t feel justified in telling her , behind your back , if I thought you unsuited for the place ; but I should certainly feel justified , ”
54419	54432	54413	54413	he	71	“ in telling YOU if I thought the place unsuited to you . ”
54433	54446	54532	54532	She	1320	“ And that ’s what you ’re trying to tell me now ? ”
54447	54458	54413	54413	he	71	“ Yes ; but not for the reasons you imagine . ”
54459	54472	54413	54413	he	71	“ What , then , are your reasons , if you please ? ”
54473	54519	54532	54532	She	1320	“ I ’ve already implied them in advising you not to give up all idea of the theatre . You ’re too various , too gifted , too personal , to tie yourself down , at your age , to the dismal drudgery of teaching . ”
54520	54531	54532	54532	She	1320	“ And is THAT what you ’ve told Mrs. Leath ? ”
54560	54568	54569	54569	he	71	“ I ’ve told her exactly nothing , ”
54572	54603	54569	54569	he	71	“ And what -- exactly -- do you mean by ‘ nothing ’ ? You and she were talking about me when I came into her sitting - room yesterday . ”
54613	54634	54569	54569	he	71	“ I ’ve told her , simply , that I ’d seen you once or twice at Mrs. Murrett ’s . ”
54635	54646	54671	54671	He	71	“ And not that you ’ve ever seen me since ? ”
54647	54658	54569	54569	he	71	“ And not that I ’ve ever seen you since ... ”
54659	54670	54671	54671	He	71	“ And she believes you -- she completely believes you ? ”
54688	54705	54678	54678	his	71	“ Oh , I beg your pardon ! I did n’t mean to ask you that . ”
54728	54752	54722	54722	she	297	“ Well , then , thank you -- and let me relieve your fears . I sha’n’t be Effie ’s governess much longer . ”
54778	54802	54803	54803	She	297	“ You really do agree with me , then ? And you ’ll give me a chance to talk things over with you ? ”
54812	54831	54805	54805	her	297	“ I ’m not thinking of the stage . I ’ve had another offer : that ’s all . ”
54852	54865	54866	54866	Her	297	“ You ’ll tell me about that , then -- won’t you ? ”
54871	54894	54866	54866	Her	297	“ Oh , you ’ll hear about it soon ... I must catch Effie now and drag her back to the blackboard . ”
54911	54924	54925	54925	she	297	“ I ’ve been odious to you -- and not quite honest , ”
54930	54935	54936	54936	he	71	“ Not quite honest ? ”
54947	54979	54936	54936	he	71	“ I mean , in seeming not to trust you . It ’s come over me again as we talked that , at heart , I ’ve always KNOWN I could ... ”
55024	55030	55031	55031	she	297	“ Here ’s Effie now ! ”
55426	55436	55416	55416	he	71	“ I came out to look for your mother . ”
55832	55857	55859	55859	she	97	“ I feel as if I could trust my happiness to carry me ; as if it had grown out of me like wings . ”
56152	56156	56149	56149	she	97	“ Come in ! ”
56182	56198	56179	56179	her	97	“ You ’ve come to ask me why I have n’t spoken to your grandmother ! ”
56233	56241	56242	56242	he	71	“ I ’ve spoken to her myself , ”
56251	56260	56245	56245	Anna	97	“ You ’ve spoken to her ? When ? ”
56261	56272	56273	56273	Anna	97	“ Just now . I left her to come here . ”
56320	56363	56310	56310	She	97	“ You asked me to help you and I promised you I would . It was hardly worth while to work out such an elaborate plan of action if you intended to take the matter out of my hands without telling me . ”
56364	56375	56376	56376	he	71	“ Oh , do n’t take that tone with me ! ”
56383	56390	56376	56376	he	71	“ That tone ? What tone ? ”
56398	56402	56403	56403	she	97	“ I might , ”
56411	56420	56403	56403	she	97	“ more properly make that request of YOU ! ”
56429	56452	56453	56453	She	97	“ I meant that I HAD to speak -- that ’s all . You do n’t give me a chance to explain ... ”
56467	56507	56453	56453	She	97	“ Owen ! Do n’t I always want to give you every chance ? It ’s because I DO that I wanted to talk to your grandmother first -- that I was waiting and watching for the right moment ... ”
56508	56523	56524	56524	His	71	“ The right moment ? So was I. That ’s why I ’ve spoken . ”
56556	56589	56549	56549	herself	233	“ Oh , my dear , it ’s not a privilege to quarrel over ! You ’ve taken a load off my shoulders . Sit down and tell me all about it . ”
56597	56604	56605	56605	he	71	“ I ca n’t sit down , ”
56608	56622	56605	56605	he	71	“ Walk about , then . Only tell me : I ’m impatient . ”
56676	56688	56663	56663	her	97	“ Well -- of course it was just what one expected . ”
56689	56699	56663	56663	her	97	“ She takes it so badly , you mean ? ”
56700	56739	56740	56740	Anna	97	“ All the heavy batteries were brought up : my father , Givre , Monsieur de Chantelle , the throne and the altar . Even my poor mother was dragged out of oblivion and armed with imaginary protests . ”
56746	56756	56740	56740	Anna	97	“ Well -- you were prepared for all that ? ”
56757	56784	56663	56663	her	97	“ I thought I was , till I began to hear her say it . Then it sounded so incredibly silly that I told her so . ”
56785	56792	56663	56663	her	97	“ Oh , Owen -- Owen ! ”
56793	56811	56740	56740	Anna	97	“ Yes : I know . I was a fool ; but I could n’t help it . ”
56812	56832	56833	56833	She	97	“ And you ’ve mortally offended her , I suppose ? That ’s exactly what I wanted to prevent . ”
56841	56856	56833	56833	She	97	“ You tiresome boy , not to wait and let me speak for you ! ”
56871	56877	56878	56878	he	1359	“ You do n’t understand , ”
56883	56940	56941	56941	He	1359	“ I do n’t see how I can , till you explain . If you thought the time had come to tell your grandmother , why not have asked me to do it ? I had my reasons for waiting ; but if you ’d told me to speak I should have done so , naturally . ”
56950	56958	56959	56959	Anna	97	“ What WERE your reasons for waiting ? ”
56986	57000	56978	56978	his	1359	“ I was feeling my way ... I wanted to be absolutely sure ... ”
57001	57007	57008	57008	She	97	“ Absolutely sure of what ? ”
57017	57028	57008	57008	She	97	“ Why , simply of OUR side of the case . ”
57029	57053	56978	56978	his	1359	“ But you told me you were , the other day , when we talked it over before they came back from Ouchy . ”
57054	57088	56978	56978	his	1359	“ Oh , my dear -- if you think that , in such a complicated matter , every day , every hour , does n’t more or less modify one ’s surest sureness ! ”
57089	57108	57109	57109	She	97	“ That ’s just what I ’m driving at . I want to know what has modified yours . ”
57117	57141	57109	57109	She	97	“ What does it matter , now the thing ’s done ? I do n’t know that I could give any clear reason ... ”
57158	57168	57145	57145	his	1361	“ But it ’s absolutely necessary that you should . ”
57177	57224	57225	57225	She	97	“ It ’s not necessary that I should give you any explanation whatever , since you ’ve taken the matter out of my hands . All I can say is that I was trying to help you : that no other thought ever entered my mind . ”
57233	57249	57225	57225	She	97	“ If you doubted it , you were right to do what you ’ve done . ”
57250	57258	57259	57259	he	1361	“ Oh , I never doubted YOU ! ”
57281	57292	57293	57293	he	1361	“ Do n’t be offended if I ’ve seemed to , ”
57297	57348	57293	57293	he	1361	“ I ca n’t quite explain myself , either ... it ’s all a kind of tangle , is n’t it ? That ’s why I thought I ’d better speak at once ; or rather why I did n’t think at all , but just suddenly blurted the thing out---- ”
57358	57392	57349	57349	Anna	97	“ Well , the how and why do n’t much matter now . The point is how to deal with your grandmother . You ’ve not told me what she means to do . ”
57393	57404	57428	57428	Anna	97	“ Oh , she means to send for Adelaide Painter . ”
57424	57427	57428	57428	Anna	97	“ Perhaps , ”
57431	57442	57428	57428	Anna	97	“ it ’s really the best thing for us all . ”
57448	57463	57445	57445	his	1361	“ It ’s too preposterous and humiliating . Dragging that woman into our secrets---- ! ”
57464	57474	57475	57475	He	1361	“ This could hardly be a secret much longer . ”
57506	57521	57500	57500	he	1361	“ You have n’t , of course , spoken of it to any one ? ”
57522	57531	57532	57532	She	97	“ No ; but I intend to now . ”
57547	57568	57544	57544	she	97	“ If Adelaide Painter ’s to be told there ’s no possible reason why I should n’t tell Mr. Darrow . ”
57580	57591	57544	57544	she	97	“ None whatever : I want every one to know . ”
57620	57634	57614	57614	he	1361	“ You have n’t , as yet , said a word to him ? ”
57635	57687	57614	57614	he	1361	“ I ’ve told him nothing , except what the discussion of our own plans -- his and mine -- obliged me to : that you were thinking of marrying , and that I was n’t willing to leave France till I ’d done what I could to see you through . ”
57715	57724	57725	57725	he	1361	“ You ’re a brick , my dear ! ”
57728	57737	57725	57725	he	1361	“ You had my word , you know . ”
57738	57746	57747	57747	His	1361	“ Yes ; yes -- I know . ”
57753	57768	57747	57747	His	1361	“ And that ’s all -- positively all -- you’ve ever said to him ? ”
57769	57779	57780	57780	He	1361	“ Positively all . But why do you ask ? ”
57788	57808	57780	57780	He	1361	“ It was understood , was n’t it , that my grandmother was to be the first to know ? ”
57809	57828	57829	57829	He	1361	“ Well -- and so she has been , has n’t she , since you ’ve told her ? ”
57842	57862	57829	57829	He	1361	“ And you ’re sure that nothing you ’ve said to Darrow could possibly have given him a hint---- ? ”
57863	57873	57874	57874	He	1361	“ Nothing I ’ve said to him -- certainly . ”
57880	57890	57874	57874	He	1361	“ Why do you put it in that way ? ”
57891	57896	57829	57829	He	1361	“ In what way ? ”
57897	57911	57829	57829	He	1361	“ Why -- as if you thought some one else might have spoken ... ”
57912	57920	57921	57921	She	1363	“ Some one else ? Who else ? ”
57927	57942	57921	57921	She	1363	“ What on earth , my dear boy , can you be driving at ? ”
57943	57958	57829	57829	He	1361	“ I ’m trying to find out whether you think he knows anything definite . ”
57959	57969	57829	57829	He	1361	“ Why should I think so ? Do YOU ? ”
57970	57982	57983	57983	She	1363	“ I do n’t know . I want to find out . ”
57990	57999	57983	57983	She	1363	“ To test my veracity , I suppose ? ”
58012	58023	58009	58009	she	1363	“ Here he is -- you can ask him yourself . ”
58084	58097	58076	58076	Darrow	71	“ Am I too soon ? Or is our walk given up ? ”
58098	58109	58110	58110	She	1363	“ No ; I was just going to get ready . ”
58126	58145	58110	58110	She	1363	“ But there ’s something we want to tell you first : Owen is engaged to Miss Viner . ”
58399	58408	58409	58409	she	1363	“ You ’re surprised at Owen ’s news ? ”
58412	58419	58420	58420	he	1361	“ Yes : I am surprised , ”
58423	58434	58420	58420	he	1361	“ You had n’t thought of its being Miss Viner ? ”
58435	58445	58489	58489	He	1361	“ Why should I have thought of Miss Viner ? ”
58446	58464	58465	58465	He	1361	“ You see now why I wanted so much to find out what you knew about her . ”
58474	58488	58471	58471	she	1363	“ Now that you DO know it ’s she , if there ’s anything---- ”
58513	58542	58501	58501	His	1361	“ What on earth should there be ? As I told you , I ’ve never in my life heard any one say two words about Miss Viner . ”
58613	58626	58605	58605	He	71	“ It ’s pouring . Perhaps you ’d rather not go out ? ”
58639	58668	58669	58669	she	1363	“ I suppose I ’d better not . I ought to go at once to my mother - in - law -- Owen ’s just been telling her , ”
58672	58675	58669	58669	she	1363	“ Ah . ”
58681	58701	58676	58676	Darrow	71	“ That accounts for my having , on my way up , heard some one telephoning for Miss Painter ! ”
59147	59150	59151	59151	His	71	“ straight . ”
59377	59379	59382	59382	her	111	“ dated ”
59622	59625	59613	59613	herself	111	“ tone , ”
59726	59789	59790	59792	Madame de Chantelle	111	“ Do n’t think , please , that I ’m casting the least reflection on Anna , or showing any want of sympathy for her , when I say that I consider her partly responsible for what ’s happened . Anna is ‘ modern’--I believe that ’s what it ’s called when you read unsettling books and admire hideous pictures . Indeed , ”
59799	59897	59790	59792	Madame de Chantelle	111	“ I myself have always more or less lived in that atmosphere : my son , you know , was very revolutionary . Only he did n’t , of course , apply his ideas : they were purely intellectual . That ’s what dear Anna has always failed to understand . And I ’m afraid she ’s created the same kind of confusion in Owen ’s mind -- led him to mix up things you read about with things you do ... You know , of course , that she sides with him in this wretched business ? ”
59917	60119	59905	59905	she	111	“ My grandson , Mr. Darrow , calls me illogical and uncharitable because my feelings toward Miss Viner have changed since I ’ve heard this news . Well ! You ’ve known her , it appears , for some years : Anna tells me you used to see her when she was a companion , or secretary or something , to a dreadfully vulgar Mrs. Murrett . And I ask you as a friend , I ask you as one of US , to tell me if you think a girl who has had to knock about the world in that kind of position , and at the orders of all kinds of people , is fitted to be Owen ’s wife . I ’m not implying anything against her ! I LIKED the girl , Mr. Darrow ... But what ’s that got to do with it ? I do n’t want her to marry my grandson . If I ’d been looking for a wife for Owen , I should n’t have applied to the Farlows to find me one . That ’s what Anna wo n’t understand ; and what you must help me to make her see . ”
60216	60221	60222	60222	she	111	“ Well , then , ”
60241	60290	60291	60291	He	71	“ you can , at least , even if you wo n’t say a word to the others , tell me frankly and fairly -- and quite between ourselves -- your personal opinion of Miss Viner , since you ’ve known her so much longer than we have . ”
60340	60413	60330	60332	Madame de Chantelle	111	“ Your opinion of Mrs. Murrett is enough ! I do n’t suppose you pretend to conceal THAT ? And heaven knows what other unspeakable people she ’s been mixed up with . The only friends she can produce are called Hoke ... Don’t try to reason with me , Mr. Darrow . There are feelings that go deeper than facts ... And I KNOW she thought of studying for the stage ... ”
60428	60439	60440	60440	she	111	“ I ’m old - fashioned -- like my furniture , ”
60443	60456	60440	60440	she	111	“ And I thought I could count on you , Mr. Darrow ... ”
60875	60902	60869	60869	he	71	“ It ’s one thing to know nothing against the girl , it ’s another to pretend that I think her a good match for Owen . ”
61154	61156	61153	61153	her	97	“ scene ”
61172	61174	61169	61184	a generation when “ scenes ” ( in the ladylike and lachrymal sense of the term	1415	“ scenes ”
61245	61300	61301	61301	She	97	“ She told me she ’d sent for you : she always ‘ sends for ’ people in emergencies . That again , I suppose , is DE L’EPOQUE . And failing Adelaide Painter , who ca n’t get here till this afternoon , there was no one but poor you to turn to . ”
61450	61459	61462	61462	Anna	97	“ Do tell me just what you said , ”
61472	61488	61469	61469	he	71	“ I quite understand your mother - in - law ’s feeling as she does . ”
61516	61536	61511	61511	Anna	97	“ Of course . It ’s inevitable that she should . But we shall bring her round in time . ”
61548	61592	61541	61541	she	97	“ Do n’t you remember what you said the day before yesterday ? ‘ Together we ca n’t fail to pull it off for him ! ’ I ’ve told Owen that , so you ’re pledged and there ’s no going back . ”
61623	61626	61627	61627	he	71	“ Anna , ”
61632	61642	61627	61627	he	71	“ why are you so anxious for this marriage ? ”
61650	61678	61643	61643	She	97	“ Why ? But surely I ’ve explained to you -- or rather I ’ve hardly had to , you seemed so in sympathy with my reasons ! ”
61679	61696	61715	61715	her	97	“ I did n’t know , then , who it was that Owen wanted to marry . ”
61721	61739	61715	61715	her	97	“ You knew yesterday ; and you assured me then that you had n’t a word to say---- ”
61740	61745	61715	61715	her	97	“ Against Miss Viner ? ”
61760	61781	61782	61782	Anna	97	“ Of course not . But that does n’t necessarily imply that I think her a good match for Owen . ”
61796	61809	61789	61789	she	97	“ Why do n’t you think her a good match for Owen ? ”
61810	61829	61789	61789	she	97	“ Well -- Madame de Chantelle ’s reasons seem to me not quite as negligible as you think . ”
61830	61876	61789	61789	she	97	“ You mean the fact that she ’s been Mrs. Murrett ’s secretary , and that the people who employed her before were called Hoke ? For , as far as Owen and I can make out , these are the gravest charges against her . ”
61877	61896	61934	61934	she	1424	“ Still , one can understand that the match is not what Madame de Chantelle had dreamed of . ”
61897	61909	61789	61789	she	97	“ Oh , perfectly -- if that ’s all you mean . ”
61941	61949	61934	61934	she	1424	“ Is it really all you mean ? ”
61950	61954	61957	61957	himself	1425	“ Of course , ”
61960	61990	61991	61991	She	1424	“ Oh , then I think I shall convince you -- even if I ca n’t , like Madame de Chantelle , summon all the Everards to my aid ! ”
62455	62465	62452	62452	he	71	“ You ’re not going to the lodge yourself ? ”
62466	62488	62452	62452	he	71	“ I ’ve sent one of the men ahead with the things ; but I thought Mrs. Leath might need me . ”
62489	62497	62498	62498	he	71	“ She did n’t ask for you , ”
62513	62519	62509	62509	she	82	“ I ’d better go . ”
62547	62554	62541	62541	she	82	“ You ’ve forgotten your mackintosh . ”
62555	62561	62562	62562	She	82	“ I sha’n’t need it . ”
62639	62665	62635	62635	Darrow	71	“ Would n’t it have been fairer , when we talked together yesterday , to tell me what I ’ve just heard from Mrs. Leath ? ”
62666	62669	62670	62670	She	82	“ Fairer---- ? ”
62678	62698	62699	62699	She	82	“ If I ’d known that your future was already settled I should have spared you my gratuitous suggestions . ”
62712	62727	62699	62699	She	82	“ I could n’t speak yesterday . I meant to have told you today . ”
62728	62767	62768	62768	She	82	“ Oh , I ’m not reproaching you for your lack of confidence . Only , if you HAD told me , I should have been more sure of your really meaning what you said to me yesterday . ”
62797	62808	62809	62809	she	82	“ Is it so important that you should be sure ? ”
62813	62820	62821	62821	he	1451	“ Not to you , naturally , ”
63076	63089	63090	63090	he	71	“ Let me tell the doctor ’s boy to drive you back , ”
63097	63104	63106	63106	he	71	“ No ; I ’ll walk , ”
63200	63207	63208	63208	he	71	“ What I meant just now , ”
63211	63225	63208	63208	he	71	“ was that you ought to have been sure of my good wishes . ”
63233	63239	63226	63226	She	75	“ Sure enough for what ? ”
63240	63251	63290	63290	she	75	“ To trust me a little farther than you did . ”
63252	63266	63290	63290	she	75	“ I ’ve told you that yesterday I was n’t free to speak . ”
63267	63283	63284	63284	She	75	“ Well , since you are now , may I say a word to you ? ”
63311	63323	63290	63290	she	75	“ I ca n’t think what you can have to say . ”
63324	63347	63348	63348	He	71	“ It ’s not easy to say here , at any rate . And indoors I sha’n’t know where to say it . ”
63356	63370	63348	63348	He	71	“ Let ’s walk over to the spring - house for a minute . ”
63499	63506	63507	63507	he	71	“ Now we can talk quietly , ”
63533	63545	63529	63529	She	75	“ I ca n’t think what you can have to say . ”
63648	63657	63658	63658	he	71	“ Have you nothing to say to ME ? ”
63681	63686	63677	63677	her	75	“ About my marriage ? ”
63687	63692	63693	63693	She	75	“ About your marriage . ”
63704	63718	63693	63693	She	75	“ What can I say that Mrs. Leath has not already told you ? ”
63719	63737	63677	63677	her	75	“ Mrs. Leath has told me nothing whatever but the fact -- and her pleasure in it . ”
63738	63749	63677	63677	her	75	“ Well ; are n’t those the two essential points ? ”
63750	63761	63677	63677	her	75	“ The essential points to YOU ? I should have thought---- ”
63762	63771	63772	63772	she	75	“ Oh , to YOU , I meant , ”
63789	63812	63777	63777	He	71	“ The essential point to me is , of course , that you should be doing what ’s really best for you . ”
63883	63898	63899	63899	she	75	“ Do you think my engagement to Mr. Leath not really best for me ? ”
63946	63952	63953	63953	he	71	“ I ’m not sure , ”
63956	63968	63953	63953	he	71	“ of its being the best thing for either of you . ”
64000	64010	63989	63989	She	75	“ From whose point of view do you speak ? ”
64011	64021	64071	64071	his	71	“ Naturally , that of the persons most concerned . ”
64022	64043	64071	64071	his	71	“ From Owen ’s , then , of course ? You do n’t think me a good match for him ? ”
64044	64063	64064	64064	He	71	“ From yours , first of all . I do n’t think him a good match for you . ”
64153	64165	64166	64166	he	71	“ I do n’t think him a good match for you , ”
64191	64203	64178	64178	She	75	“ And you ’ve brought me here to tell me why ? ”
64238	64262	64264	64264	his	71	“ My chief reason is that I believe he ’s too young and inexperienced to give you the kind of support you need . ”
64308	64320	64299	64299	she	75	“ But you see I ’ve always had to support myself ! ”
64321	64327	64328	64328	Darrow	71	“ He ’s a boy , ”
64332	64369	64328	64328	Darrow	71	“ a charming , wonderful boy ; but with no more notion than a boy how to deal with the inevitable daily problems ... the trivial stupid unimportant things that life is chiefly made up of . ”
64370	64379	64380	64380	she	75	“ I ’ll deal with them for him , ”
64383	64392	64393	64393	She	75	“ They ’ll be more than ordinarily difficult . ”
64401	64412	64393	64393	She	75	“ You must have some special reason for saying so . ”
64413	64422	64328	64328	Darrow	71	“ Only my clear perception of the facts . ”
64423	64430	64431	64431	Darrow	71	“ What facts do you mean ? ”
64434	64442	64443	64443	he	71	“ You must know better than I , ”
64448	64460	64443	64443	he	71	“ that the way wo n’t be made easy to you . ”
64461	64474	64328	64328	Darrow	71	“ Mrs. Leath , at any rate , has made it so . ”
64475	64482	64443	64443	he	71	“ Madame de Chantelle will not . ”
64483	64490	64491	64491	she	75	“ How do YOU know that ? ”
64526	64535	64523	64523	he	71	“ Madame de Chantelle sent for me yesterday . ”
64536	64548	64553	64553	her	75	“ Sent for you -- to talk to you about me ? ”
64564	64593	64556	64556	her	75	“ By what right , I should like to know ? What have you to do with me , or with anything in the world that concerns me ? ”
64631	64655	64656	64656	She	75	“ I ’m an old friend of Mrs. Leath ’s . It ’s not unnatural that Madame de Chantelle should talk to me . ”
64710	64722	64698	64698	She	75	“ May I ask what Madame de Chantelle said to you ? ”
64723	64736	64698	64698	She	75	“ She made it clear that she should not encourage the marriage . ”
64737	64750	64698	64698	She	75	“ And what was her object in making that clear to YOU ? ”
64754	64759	64698	64698	She	75	“ I suppose she thought---- ”
64760	64773	64774	64774	He	71	“ That she could persuade you to turn Mrs. Leath against me ? ”
64783	64788	64779	64779	she	75	“ Was that it ? ”
64789	64794	64698	64698	She	75	“ That was it . ”
64795	64806	64698	64698	She	75	“ But if you don’t -- if you keep your promise---- ”
64807	64811	64779	64779	she	75	“ My promise ? ”
64812	64820	64821	64821	Her	75	“ To say nothing ... nothing whatever ... ”
64846	64858	64833	64833	she	75	“ Of course I shall say nothing ... you know that ... ”
64870	64880	64865	64865	his	71	“ You know I would n’t for the world ... ”
64954	64970	64941	64941	she	75	“ Do n’t suppose I do n’t know what you must have thought of me ! ”
64985	64990	64991	64991	he	71	“ My poor child , ”
64996	65012	64991	64991	he	71	“ the shame of it is that I ’ve never thought of you at all ! ”
65020	65031	65014	65014	he	71	“ I ’ll do anything I can to help you . ”
65086	65100	65081	65081	she	75	“ You think , then , I ’ve no right to marry him ? ”
65101	65111	65081	65081	she	75	“ No right ? God forbid ! I only meant---- ”
65112	65126	65127	65127	She	75	“ That you ’d rather I did n’t marry any friend of yours . ”
65183	65209	65176	65176	he	71	“ I ’ll tell you exactly what I meant . You ’ll be wretched if you marry a man you ’re not in love with . ”
65324	65333	65319	65319	she	297	“ You ’re mistaken -- you’re quite mistaken . ”
65340	65343	65334	65334	He	71	“ Mistaken---- ? ”
65344	65361	65362	65362	she	297	“ In thinking what you think . I ’m as happy as if I deserved it ! ”
65378	65384	65385	65385	she	297	“ NOW are you satisfied ? ”
66413	66423	66399	66399	her	97	“ What sort of boots have you got on ? ”
66445	66498	66436	66436	she	97	“ Until Americans get used to the fact that France is under water for half the year they ’re perpetually risking their lives by not being properly protected . I suppose you ’ve been tramping through all this nasty clammy mud as if you ’d been taking a stroll on Boston Common . ”
66537	66544	66527	66533	the lady , with a contemptuous snort	1508	“ You young men are all alike---- “
66558	66643	66548	66548	she	97	“ I suppose you ’re George Darrow ? I used to know one of your mother ’s cousins , who married a Tunstall of Mount Vernon Street . My name is Adelaide Painter . Have you been in Boston lately ? No ? I ’m sorry for that . I hear there have been several new houses built at the lower end of Commonwealth Avenue and I hoped you could tell me about them . I have n’t been there for thirty years myself . ”
67020	67023	67009	67009	She	1517	“ those people ”
67116	67119	67157	67157	Her	1517	“ those people ”
67138	67155	67157	67157	Her	1517	“ when , by a miracle , I do n’t put them in the box myself . ”
67558	67570	67553	67553	she	97	“ Madame de Chantelle wants you to go up to her . ”
67571	67580	67553	67553	she	97	“ To go up to her ? Now ? ”
67581	67599	67600	67600	She	97	“ That ’s the message she sent . She appears to rely on you to do something . ”
67606	67617	67600	67600	She	97	“ Whatever it is , let ’s have it over ! ”
67660	67672	67673	67673	he	71	“ But what in the name of goodness can I do ? ”
67683	67699	67673	67673	he	71	“ I do n’t know . But Owen seems so to rely on you , too---- ”
67700	67709	67767	67767	she	97	“ Owen ! Is HE to be there ? ”
67710	67725	67767	67767	she	97	“ No . But you know I told him he could count on you . ”
67726	67742	67673	67673	he	71	“ But I ’ve said to your mother - in - law all I could . ”
67743	67753	67767	67767	she	97	“ Well , then you can only repeat it . ”
67782	67797	67775	67775	he	71	“ There ’s no possible reason for my being mixed up in this affair ! ”
67805	67813	67814	67814	she	97	“ Not the fact that I am ? ”
67826	67838	67845	67845	She	97	“ Why should you be , either -- to this extent ? ”
67870	67876	67877	67877	she	97	“ I do n’t know , ”
67881	67899	67877	67877	she	97	“ but , somehow , if THEY’RE not happy I feel as if we should n’t be . ”
67900	67904	67905	67905	Darrow	71	“ Oh , well-- ”
68027	68044	68023	68023	she	111	“ Mr. Darrow , I ca n’t help feeling that at heart you ’re with me ! ”
68071	68081	68059	68059	he	71	“ But Anna declares you have -- on hers ! ”
68145	68166	68135	68135	He	71	“ If there were anything I could possibly say I should want it to be in Miss Viner ’s favour . ”
68167	68184	68135	68135	He	71	“ You ’d want it to be -- yes ! But could you make it so ? ”
68185	68223	68246	68246	She	111	“ As far as facts go , I do n’t see how I can make it either for or against her . I ’ve already said that I know nothing of her except that she ’s charming . ”
68224	68239	68240	68241	Miss Painter	138	“ As if that were n’t enough -- weren’t all there OUGHT to be ! ”
68264	68272	68273	68273	she	111	“ Madame de Chantelle seems to imagine , ”
68276	68344	68273	68273	she	111	“ that a young American girl ought to have a dossier -- a police - record , or whatever you call it : what those awful women in the streets have here . In our country it ’s enough to know that a young girl ’s pure and lovely : people do n’t immediately ask her to show her bank - account and her visiting - list . ”
68355	68371	68345	68347	Madame de Chantelle	111	“ You do n’t expect me not to ask if she ’s got a family ? ”
68372	68418	68345	68347	Madame de Chantelle	111	“ No ; nor to think the worse of her if she has n’t . The fact that she ’s an orphan ought , with your ideas , to be a merit . You wo n’t have to invite her father and mother to Givre ! ”
68419	68424	68345	68347	Madame de Chantelle	111	“ Adelaide -- Adelaide ! ”
68431	68435	68425	68428	the mistress of Givre	1544	“ Lucretia Mary , ”
68453	68476	68345	68347	Madame de Chantelle	111	name--“you know you sent for Mr. Darrow to refute me ; and how can he , till he knows what I think ? ”
68477	68495	68425	68428	the mistress of Givre	1544	“ You think it ’s perfectly simple to let Owen marry a girl we know nothing about ? ”
68496	68512	68559	68561	Madame de Chantelle	111	“ No ; but I do n’t think it ’s perfectly simple to prevent him . ”
68570	68652	68564	68564	her	138	“ I have n’t a word to say against Miss Viner ; but she ’s knocked about so , as it ’s called , that she must have been mixed up with some rather dreadful people . If only Owen could be made to see that -- if one could get at a few facts , I mean . She says , for instance , that she has a sister ; but it seems she does n’t even know her address ! ”
68653	68959	68564	68564	her	138	“ If she does , she may not want to give it to you . I daresay the sister ’s one of the dreadful people . I ’ve no doubt that with a little time you could rake up dozens of them : have her ‘ traced ’ , as they call it in detective stories . I do n’t think you ’d frighten Owen , but you might : it ’s natural enough he should have been corrupted by those foreign ideas . You might even manage to part him from the girl ; but you could n’t keep him from being in love with her . I saw that when I looked them over last evening . I said to myself : ‘ It ’s a real old - fashioned American case , as sweet and sound as home - made bread . ’ Well , if you take his loaf away from him , what are you going to feed him with instead ? Which of your nasty Paris poisons do you think he ’ll turn to ? Supposing you succeed in keeping him out of a really bad mess -- and , knowing the young man as I do , I rather think that , at this crisis , the only way to do it would be to marry him slap off to somebody else -- well , then , who , may I ask , would you pick out ? One of your sweet French ingenues , I suppose ? With as much mind as a minnow and as much snap as a soft - boiled egg . You might hustle him into that kind of marriage ; I daresay you could -- but if I know Owen , the natural thing would happen before the first baby was weaned . ”
68960	68974	69199	69199	she	1546	“ I do n’t know why you insinuate such odious things against Owen ! ”
68975	69044	69045	69047	Madame de Chantelle	111	“ Do you think it would be odious of him to return to his real love when he ’d been forcibly parted from her ? At any rate , it ’s what your French friends do , every one of them ! Only they do n’t generally have the grace to go back to an old love ; and I believe , upon my word , Owen would ! ”
69059	69082	69045	69047	Madame de Chantelle	111	“ Of course you realize , Adelaide , that in suggesting this you ’re insinuating the most shocking things against Miss Viner ? ”
69083	69174	69175	69175	Darrow	71	“ When I say that if you part two young things who are dying to be happy in the lawful way it ’s ten to one they ’ll come together in an unlawful one ? I ’m insinuating shocking things against YOU , Lucretia Mary , in suggesting for a moment that you ’ll care to assume such a responsibility before your Maker . And you would n’t , if you talked things straight out with him , instead of merely sending him messages through a miserable sinner like yourself ! ”
69203	69215	69199	69199	she	1546	“ I do n’t know what Mr. Darrow’ll think of you ! ”
69216	69229	69230	69231	Miss Painter	138	“ Mr. Darrow probably knows his Bible as well as I do , ”
69250	69368	69230	69231	Miss Painter	138	“ I suppose you ’ve heard that Gisele de Folembray ’s husband accuses her of being mixed up with the Duc d’Arcachon in that business of trying to sell a lot of imitation pearls to Mrs. Homer Pond , the Chicago woman the Duke ’s engaged to ? It seems the jeweller says Gisele brought Mrs. Pond there , and got twenty - five per cent -- which of course she passed on to d’Arcachon . The poor old Duchess is in a fearful state -- so afraid her son’ll lose Mrs. Pond ! When I think that Gisele is old Bradford Wagstaff ’s grand - daughter , I ’m thankful he ’s safe in Mount Auburn ! ”
69498	69578	69493	69494	Miss Painter	138	“ I do n’t know how she does it , unless it ’s by the dead weight of her convictions . She detests the French so that she ’d back up Owen even if she knew nothing -- or knew too much -- of Miss Viner . She somehow regards the match as a protest against the corruption of European morals . I told Owen that was his great chance , and he ’s made the most of it . ”
69579	69599	69603	69603	her	1550	“ What a tactician you are ! You make me feel that I hardly know the rudiments of diplomacy , ”
69623	69642	69616	69616	She	1550	“ I ’m afraid I think nothing short of my own happiness is worth wasting any diplomacy on ! ”
69643	69658	69659	69659	he	71	“ That ’s why I mean to resign from the service of my country , ”
69880	69883	69860	69862	Madame de Chantelle	111	“ sent for ”
70069	70083	70084	70084	she	97	“ I want to thank you for what you ’ve done for Owen , ”
70092	70097	70098	70098	he	71	“ Who -- I ? ”
70101	70110	70098	70098	he	71	“ Are you confusing me with Miss Painter ? ”
70111	70120	70123	70123	herself	97	“ Perhaps I ought to say for ME , ”
70125	70139	70123	70123	herself	97	“ You ’ve been even more of a help to us than Adelaide . ”
70140	70152	70098	70098	he	71	“ My dear child ! What on earth have I done ? ”
70153	70172	70173	70173	Darrow	71	“ You ’ve managed to hide from Madame de Chantelle that you do n’t really like poor Sophy . ”
70181	70195	70173	70173	Darrow	71	“ Not like her ? What put such an idea into your head ? ”
70196	70258	70098	70098	he	71	“ Oh , it ’s more than an idea -- it ’s a feeling . But what difference does it make , after all ? You saw her in such a different setting that it ’s natural you should be a little doubtful . But when you know her better I ’m sure you ’ll feel about her as I do . ”
70259	70277	70098	70098	he	71	“ It ’s going to be hard for me not to feel about everything as you do . ”
70278	70293	70294	70294	He	71	“ Well , then -- please begin with my daughter - in - law ! ”
70305	70326	70294	70294	He	71	“ Agreed : if you ll agree to feel as I do about the pressing necessity of our getting married . ”
70327	70433	70434	70434	She	1564	“ I want to talk to you about that too . You do n’t know what a weight is off my mind ! With Sophy here for good , I shall feel so differently about leaving Effie . I ’ve seen much more accomplished governesses -- to my cost!--but I ’ve never seen a young thing more gay and kind and human . You must have noticed , though you ’ve seen them so little together , how Effie expands when she ’s with her . And that , you know , is what I want . Madame de Chantelle will provide the necessary restraint . ”
70442	70493	70434	70434	She	1564	“ Yes , I ’m ready to go with you now . But first of all -- this very moment!--you must come with me to Effie . She knows , of course , nothing of what ’s been happening ; and I want her to be told first about YOU . ”
70542	70551	70536	70536	He	1565	“ It ’s over -- it ’s over , ”
70586	70594	70595	70595	Anna	97	“ She ’s giving him his dinner , ”
70604	70613	70598	70598	her	97	“ Do n’t forget the gold - fish ! ”
70627	70633	70621	70621	Darrow	71	“ Oh -- not now ! ”
70634	70638	70598	70598	her	97	“ Not now ? ”
70639	70659	70664	70664	she	97	“ I mean -- she’d rather have you tell her first . I ’ll wait for you both downstairs . ”
70670	70683	70664	70664	she	97	“ As you please . I ’ll bring her down at once . ”
70699	70713	70696	70696	her	97	“ No , Sophy , do n’t go ! I want you both . ”
70984	70994	70995	70995	she	639	“ And is Sophy awfully happy about it too ? ”
71020	71032	71033	71033	Anna	97	“ Why , dearest , did n’t you see she was ? ”
71045	71055	71056	71057	the child	639	“ I think I should like to ask her , ”
71077	71101	71073	71074	her mother	221	“ Do , darling , do ! Run off at once , and tell her we expect her to be awfully happy too . ”
71143	71145	71116	71116	Darrow	71	“ engaged ”
71688	71700	71669	71669	she	858	“ The same dress ? That proves that she ’s forgotten ! ”
71776	71783	71784	71784	Effie	74	“ Oh , there ’s Owen ! ”
71820	71825	71826	71826	she	81	“ You , too ? ”
71833	71838	71826	71826	she	81	“ I did n’t know---- ”
71862	71874	71846	71846	she	81	“ I wish you all the luck that we can spare ! ”
72250	72268	72236	72236	Owen	75	“ What ’s the use of this , with such a moon to say it for us ? ”
72286	72296	72297	72297	Anna	97	“ Yes -- let ’s go out and listen , ”
72357	72364	72354	72354	Darrow	71	“ You must have one too , ”
72381	72389	72372	72372	Sophy	81	“ We ’ll bring things for everybody . ”
72714	72722	72723	72723	she	81	“ Good - night , dear child , ”
73082	73094	73072	73072	Anna	97	“ You do like him , do n’t you , dear ? ”
73095	73103	73104	73104	Effie	74	“ Oh , most awfully , dearest , ”
73120	73136	73137	73137	she	74	“ And so do Granny and Owen -- and I DO think Sophy does too , ”
73147	73152	73137	73137	she	74	“ I hope so , ”
73163	73178	73156	73156	She	97	“ Has she talked to you about him , that you ’re so sure ? ”
73274	73283	73268	73268	Anna	97	“ There ’s Nurse to carry you off . ”
73284	73291	73292	73294	the little girl	858	“ It ’s Sophy ’s knock , ”
73314	73318	73319	73319	Anna	97	“ Come in , ”
73332	73343	73344	73345	the girl	297	“ May Effie go out for a turn with Nurse ? ”
73348	73359	73344	73345	the girl	297	“ I should like to speak to you a moment . ”
73360	73382	73383	73383	she	97	“ Of course . This ought to be YOUR holiday , as yesterday was Effie ’s . Run off , dear , ”
73412	73439	73398	73398	she	97	“ I ’m so glad you came , my dear . We ’ve got so many things to talk about , just you and I together . ”
73556	73586	73587	73587	She	97	“ Come and sit by me , dear . I wanted to see you alone . There ’s so much to say that I hardly know where to begin . ”
73805	73815	73800	73800	Anna	97	“ My dear child , what ’s the matter ? ”
73833	73878	73879	73879	She	97	“ Please do n’t be afraid to tell me . I do so want you to feel that you can trust me as Owen does . And you know you must n’t mind if , just at first , Madame de Chantelle occasionally relapses . ”
74196	74232	74187	74187	She	97	“ When his grandmother sees how happy Owen is she ’ll be quite happy herself . If it ’s only that , do n’t be distressed . Just trust to Owen -- and the future . ”
74258	74273	74233	74234	Sophy Viner	81	“ That ’s what I wanted to talk to you about -- the future . ”
74274	74302	74303	74304	The girl	297	“ Of course ! We ’ve all so many plans to make -- and to fit into each other ’s . Please let ’s begin with yours . ”
74331	74345	74328	74328	she	297	“ I should like to make no plans at all ... just yet ... ”
74346	74350	74328	74328	she	297	“ No plans ? ”
74351	74372	74373	74373	Her	297	“ No -- I should like to go away ... my friends the Farlows would let me go to them ... ”
74385	74399	74378	74378	she	297	“ I should like to leave today , if you do n’t mind . ”
74407	74416	74417	74417	She	297	“ You want to leave Givre at once ? ”
74427	74474	74417	74417	She	297	“ You prefer to be with your friends till your marriage ? I understand that -- but surely you need n’t rush off today ? There are so many details to discuss ; and before long , you know , I shall be going away too . ”
74475	74481	74482	74483	The girl	297	“ Yes , I know . ”
74492	74512	74482	74483	The girl	297	“ But I should like to wait a few days -- to have a little more time to myself . ”
74612	74644	74588	74588	she	297	“ My dear child , if you really want to go at once I sha’n’t , of course , urge you to stay . I suppose you have spoken to Owen ? ”
74645	74651	74652	74652	Anna	97	“ No . Not yet ... ”
74660	74671	74652	74652	Anna	97	“ You mean to say you have n’t told him ? ”
74672	74691	74696	74696	she	97	“ I wanted to tell you first . I thought I ought to , on account of Effie . ”
74702	74706	74696	74696	she	97	“ Oh , Effie!-- ”
74715	74744	74745	74745	she	97	“ Owen has a right to ask that you should consider him before you think of his sister ... Of course you shall do just as you wish , ”
74754	74760	74745	74745	she	97	“ Oh , thank you , ”
74788	74796	74797	74797	she	97	“ You ’ll tell Owen at once ? ”
74896	74903	74904	74904	he	1665	“ Darrow ’s looking for you , ”
74909	74928	74904	74904	he	1665	“ He asked me to remind you that you ’d promised to go for a walk with him . ”
74935	74942	74929	74929	Anna	97	“ I ’ll go down presently . ”
74963	74973	74949	74950	Sophy Viner	81	“ You ’d better tell Owen , my dear . ”
74983	74994	74974	74974	Owen	75	“ Tell me what ? Why , what ’s happened ? ”
75008	75031	75032	75032	Owen	75	“ Do n’t look so startled ! Nothing , except that Sophy proposes to desert us for a while for the Farlows . ”
75037	75048	75049	75049	He	1668	“ I was afraid she ’d run off before long . ”
75054	75066	75049	75049	He	1668	“ Do please keep her here as long as you can ! ”
75070	75081	75067	75067	Sophy	81	“ Mrs. Leath ’s already given me leave to go . ”
75082	75089	75101	75101	her	81	“ Already ? To go when ? ”
75090	75093	75095	75095	Sophy	81	“ Today , ”
75107	75118	75101	75101	her	81	“ Today ? Why on earth should you go today ? ”
75145	75150	75135	75135	His	1668	“ Something ’s happened . ”
75160	75172	75151	75151	He	1668	“ I suppose she must have told you what it is ? ”
75202	75231	75232	75232	Owen	75	“ She ’s told me nothing except that she wishes to be with her friends . It ’s quite natural that she should want to go to them . ”
75237	75244	75245	75245	He	1668	“ Of course -- quite natural . ”
75250	75271	75245	75245	He	1668	“ But why did n’t you tell me so ? Why did you come first to my step - mother ? ”
75279	75301	75275	75275	her	97	“ That seems to me quite natural , too . Sophy was considerate enough to tell me first because of Effie . ”
75306	75332	75333	75333	He	1668	“ Very well , then : that ’s quite natural , as you say . And of course she must do exactly as she pleases . ”
75342	75345	75346	75346	he	1668	“ Tomorrow , ”
75350	75361	75346	75346	he	1668	“ I shall go up to Paris to see you . ”
75362	75369	75370	75370	she	297	“ Oh , no -- no ! ”
75379	75389	75373	75373	Owen	75	“ NOW do you say that nothing ’s happened ? ”
75423	75461	75463	75463	she	97	“ If it ’s anything that Sophy wishes to tell you , no doubt she ’ll do so . I ’m going down now , and I ’ll leave you here to talk it over by yourselves . ”
75475	75499	75468	75469	the girl	297	“ But there ’s nothing to tell : why should there be ? I ’ve explained that I simply want to be quiet . ”
75512	75523	75508	75508	Owen	75	“ Is that why I may n’t go up tomorrow ? ”
75524	75528	75500	75500	Her	297	“ Not tomorrow ! ”
75529	75535	75500	75500	Her	297	“ Then when may I ? ”
75536	75548	75508	75508	Owen	75	“ Later ... in a little while ... a few days ... ”
75549	75555	75500	75500	Her	297	“ In how many days ? ”
75556	75559	75500	75500	Her	297	“ Owen ! ”
75575	75596	75597	75597	he	1674	“ If you go away today , the day that our engagement ’s made known , it ’s only fair , ”
75600	75613	75597	75597	he	1674	“ that you should tell me when I am to see you . ”
75626	75645	75614	75614	Sophy	81	“ It ’s you who are not fair -- when I ’ve said I wanted to be quiet . ”
75646	75681	75747	75748	Sophy Viner	81	“ But why should my coming disturb you ? I ’m not asking now to come tomorrow . I only ask you not to leave without telling me when I ’m to see you . ”
75682	75691	75692	75695	his step - mother	233	“ Owen , I do n’t understand you ! ”
75698	75742	75692	75695	his step - mother	233	“ You do n’t understand my asking for some explanation , some assurance , when I ’m left in this way , without a word , without a sign ? All I ask her to tell me is when she ’ll see me . ”
75759	75771	75747	75748	Sophy Viner	81	“ After all , my dear , he ’s not unreasonable ! ”
75772	75780	75781	75782	the girl	297	“ I ’ll write -- I’ll write , ”
75785	75791	75792	75792	he	1677	“ WHAT will you write ? ”
75797	75800	75801	75801	Anna	97	“ Owen , ”
75804	75809	75801	75801	Anna	97	“ you are unreasonable ! ”
75820	75853	75810	75810	He	1677	“ I only want her to say what she means : that she ’s going to write to break off our engagement . Is n’t that what you ’re going away for ? ”
75886	75901	75871	75871	her	81	“ You ought to speak , my dear -- you ought to answer him . ”
75902	75909	75862	75862	She	97	“ I only ask him to wait---- ”
75910	75913	75914	75914	Owen	75	“ Yes , ”
75919	75928	75929	75929	Both	371	“ and you wo n’t say how long ! ”
75971	75991	75968	75968	she	97	“ What can I do , when there ’s clearly something between you that I do n’t know about ? ”
75992	76025	75968	75968	she	97	“ Oh , if it WERE between us ! Ca n’t you see it ’s outside of us -- outside of her , dragging at her , dragging her away from me ? ”
76044	76067	76036	76036	Anna	97	“ Is it true that you want to break your engagement ? If you do , you ought to tell him now . ”
76074	76090	76068	76068	Owen	75	“ She does n’t dare to -- she ’s afraid I ’ll guess the reason ! ”
76112	76134	76101	76101	she	81	“ If she does n’t wish to marry you , why should she be afraid to have you know the reason ? ”
76135	76148	76108	76108	she	81	“ She ’s afraid to have YOU know it -- not me ! ”
76149	76156	76157	76157	He	1686	“ To have ME know it ? ”
76175	76185	76186	76186	He	1686	“ Owen , you must explain what you mean ! ”
76196	76200	76201	76201	he	1686	“ Ask Darrow ! ”
76204	76209	76201	76201	he	1686	“ Owen -- Owen ! ”
76319	76340	76314	76314	she	97	“ All this is really no business of mine , and I refuse to have you mix me up in it-- ”
76357	76365	76366	76366	she	81	“ I should like to go now , ”
76396	76474	76475	76475	She	97	“ I quite agree with you , my dear , that it ’s useless to carry on this discussion . But since Mr. Darrow ’s name has been brought into it , for reasons which I fail to guess , I want to tell you that you ’re both mistaken if you think he ’s not in sympathy with your marriage . If that ’s what Owen means to imply , the idea ’s a complete delusion . ”
76534	76545	76546	76546	he	1687	“ I do n’t mean to imply what you think , ”
76562	76589	76546	76546	he	1687	“ I do n’t say Darrow does n’t like our marriage ; I say it ’s Sophy who ’s hated it since Darrow ’s been here ! ”
76629	76673	76608	76608	he	1687	“ You ’re absurd , Owen ! I do n’t know why I listen to you . Why should Sophy dislike Mr. Darrow , and if she does , why should that have anything to do with her wishing to break her engagement ? ”
76674	76711	76740	76740	he	798	“ I do n’t say she dislikes him ! I do n’t say she likes him ; I do n’t know what it is they say to each other when they ’re shut up together alone . ”
76712	76718	76719	76719	Anna	97	“ Shut up together alone ? ”
76748	76827	76740	76740	he	798	“ Yes -- the first evening she came , in the study ; the next morning , early , in the park ; yesterday , again , in the spring - house , when you were at the lodge with the doctor ... I do n’t know what they say to each other , but they ’ve taken every chance they could to say it ... and to say it when they thought that no one saw them . ”
76857	76858	76832	76832	him	798	“ something”--yes
76862	76863	76832	76832	him	798	“ something”
76898	76944	76889	76889	She	97	“ I do n’t half understand what you ’ve been saying ; but what you seem to hint is so preposterous , and so insulting both to Sophy and to me , that I see no reason why we should listen to you any longer . ”
76977	77064	76965	76965	He	798	“ How can it be preposterous , since it ’s true ? Or insulting , since I do n’t know , any more than YOU , the meaning of what I ’ve been seeing ? If you ’ll be patient with me I ’ll try to put it quietly . What I mean is that Sophy has completely changed since she met Darrow here , and that , having noticed the change , I ’m hardly to blame for having tried to find out its cause . ”
77077	77118	77065	77065	Anna	97	“ You ’re to blame , at any rate , for so recklessly assuming that you HAVE found it out . You seem to forget that , till they met here , Sophy and Mr. Darrow hardly knew each other . ”
77119	77137	77148	77148	He	798	“ If so , it ’s all the stranger that they ’ve been so often closeted together ! ”
77138	77142	77143	77144	the girl	297	“ Owen , Owen-- ”
77156	77233	77148	77148	He	798	“ Can I help it , if I ’ve seen and known what I was n’t meant to ? For God ’s sake give me a reason -- any reason I can decently make out with ! Is it my fault if , the day after you arrived , when I came back late through the garden , the curtains of the study had n’t been drawn , and I saw you there alone with Darrow ? ”
77238	77265	77234	77234	Anna	97	“ Really , Owen , if you make it a grievance that two people who are staying in the same house should be seen talking together---- ! ”
77266	77276	77148	77148	He	798	“ They were not talking . That ’s the point---- ”
77277	77295	77331	77331	He	1694	“ Not talking ? How do you know ? You could hardly hear them from the garden ! ”
77296	77330	77331	77331	He	1694	“ No ; but I could see . HE was sitting at my desk , with his face in his hands . SHE was standing in the window , looking away from him ... ”
77350	77357	77358	77358	he	1694	“ That was the first time , ”
77362	77489	77358	77358	he	1694	“ and the second was the next morning in the park . It was natural enough , their meeting there . Sophy had gone out with Effie , and Effie ran back to look for me . She told me she ’d left Sophy and Darrow in the path that leads to the river , and presently we saw them ahead of us . They did n’t see us at first , because they were standing looking at each other ; and this time they were not speaking either . We came up close before they heard us , and all that time they never spoke , or stopped looking at each other . After that I began to wonder ; and so I watched them . ”
77490	77495	77331	77331	He	1694	“ Oh , Owen ! ”
77496	77648	77649	77649	Anna	97	“ Oh , I only had to wait . Yesterday , when I motored you and the doctor back from the lodge , I saw Sophy coming out of the spring - house . I supposed she ’d taken shelter from the rain , and when you got out of the motor I strolled back down the avenue to meet her . But she ’d disappeared -- she must have taken a short cut and come into the house by the side door . I do n’t know why I went on to the spring - house ; I suppose it was what you ’d call spying . I went up the steps and found the room empty ; but two chairs had been moved out from the wall and were standing near the table ; and one of the Chinese screens that lie on it had dropped to the floor . ”
77657	77676	77649	77649	Anna	97	“ Really ? Sophy’d gone there for shelter , and she dropped a screen and moved a chair ? ”
77677	77682	77780	77780	she	297	“ I said two chairs---- ”
77683	77697	77780	77780	she	297	“ Two ? What damning evidence -- of I do n’t know what ! ”
77698	77745	77649	77649	Anna	97	“ Simply of the fact that Darrow’d been there with her . As I looked out of the window I saw him close by , walking away . He must have turned the corner of the spring - house just as I got to the door . ”
77785	77809	77780	77780	she	297	“ I ’ve absolutely nothing to say to all this ; but perhaps you ’d like me to wait and hear your answer ? ”
77821	77835	77812	77812	her	81	“ I ’ve no answer either -- except that Owen must be mad . ”
77893	77907	77882	77882	his	719	“ That ’s all then ? You wo n’t give me any reason ? ”
77908	77941	77942	77942	Owen	75	“ I did n’t suppose it was necessary to give you or any one else a reason for talking with a friend of Mrs. Leath ’s under Mrs. Leath ’s own roof . ”
77959	77997	77950	77950	he	719	“ I wo n’t ask for one , then . I ’ll only ask you to give me your assurance that your talks with Darrow have had nothing to do with your suddenly deciding to leave Givre . ”
78020	78035	78036	78036	she	97	“ I give you my assurance ; and now I should like to go , ”
78047	78058	78044	78044	Anna	97	“ My dear , I think you ought to speak . ”
78069	78077	78062	78062	herself	297	“ To him -- or to YOU ? ”
78078	78082	78083	78083	She	97	“ To him . ”
78086	78096	78083	78083	She	97	“ I ’ve said all there is to say . ”
78153	78157	78150	78150	Anna	97	“ Come in ! ”
78187	78209	78179	78179	he	71	“ I came up to see if you were ready ; but please send me off if I ’m not wanted . ”
78283	78300	78275	78275	She	97	“ Come in , please ; I want you to hear what Owen has been saying . ”
78357	78375	78350	78350	She	97	“ It ’s much better for you both that this absurd question should be cleared up now . ”
78385	78415	78382	78382	she	97	“ For some reason that I do n’t pretend to guess , Owen has taken it into his head that you ’ve influenced Miss Viner to break her engagement . ”
78465	78489	78459	78459	She	97	“ If there ’s nothing between them , they ’ll look at each other ; if there IS something , they wo n’t ; ”
78549	78557	78546	78546	he	71	“ Has Miss Viner broken her engagement ? ”
78574	78577	78567	78568	the girl	297	“ Yes ! ”
78639	78649	78650	78650	Darrow	71	“ For God ’s sake , what ’s happened ? ”
78716	78726	78705	78705	she	97	“ If only he does n’t come near me ! ”
78805	78812	78813	78813	he	71	“ Wo n’t you please explain ? ”
78816	78900	78813	78813	he	71	“ I ca n’t explain : I do n’t know . I did n’t even know -- till she told you -- that she really meant to break her engagement . All I know is that she came to me just now and said she wished to leave Givre today ; and that Owen , when he heard of it -- for she had n’t told him -- at once accused her of going away with the secret intention of throwing him over . ”
78901	78911	78912	78912	She	1708	“ And you think it ’s a definite break ? ”
78925	78937	78912	78912	She	1708	“ How should I know ? Perhaps you can tell me . ”
78938	78941	78942	78942	She	1708	“ I ? ”
78959	78965	78966	78966	she	1708	“ As I told you , ”
78970	78990	78966	78966	she	1708	“ Owen has worked himself up to imagining that for some mysterious reason you ’ve influenced Sophy against him . ”
78996	79023	78991	78991	Darrow	71	“ It must indeed be a mysterious reason ! He knows how slightly I know Miss Viner . Why should he imagine anything so wildly improbable ? ”
79024	79032	78966	78966	she	1708	“ I do n’t know that either . ”
79033	79043	78966	78966	she	1708	“ But he must have hinted at some reason . ”
79044	79128	78966	78966	she	1708	“ No : he admits he does n’t know your reason . He simply says that Sophy ’s manner to him has changed since she came back to Givre and that he ’s seen you together several times -- in the park , the spring - house , I do n’t know where -- talking alone in a way that seemed confidential -- almost secret ; and he draws the preposterous conclusion that you ’ve used your influence to turn her against him . ”
79129	79138	78966	78966	she	1708	“ My influence ? What kind of influence ? ”
79139	79145	78966	78966	she	1708	“ He does n’t say . ”
79171	79179	79158	79158	His	71	“ And what does Miss Viner say ? ”
79180	79211	78966	78966	she	1708	“ She says it ’s perfectly natural that she should occasionally talk to my friends when she ’s under my roof -- and refuses to give him any other explanation . ”
79212	79220	79158	79158	His	71	“ That at least is perfectly natural ! ”
79230	79237	79227	79227	she	97	“ Yes -- but there is something---- ”
79238	79241	78966	78966	she	1708	“ Something---- ? ”
79242	79298	78966	78966	she	1708	“ Some reason for her sudden decision to break her engagement . I can understand Owen ’s feeling , sorry as I am for his way of showing it . The girl owes him some sort of explanation , and as long as she refuses to give it his imagination is sure to run wild . ”
79299	79319	78966	78966	she	1708	“ She would have given it , no doubt , if he ’d asked it in a different tone . ”
79320	79348	78966	78966	she	1708	“ I do n’t defend Owen ’s tone -- but she knew what it was before she accepted him . She knows he ’s excitable and undisciplined . ”
79349	79376	78966	78966	she	1708	“ Well , she ’s been disciplining him a little -- probably the best thing that could happen . Why not let the matter rest there ? ”
79377	79393	79394	79394	He	1711	“ Leave Owen with the idea that you HAVE been the cause of the break ? ”
79403	79430	79394	79394	He	1711	“ Oh , as to that -- leave him with any idea of me he chooses ! But leave him , at any rate , free . ”
79431	79434	79435	79435	she	1712	“ Free ? ”
79440	79484	79435	79435	she	1712	“ Simply let things be . You ’ve surely done all you could for him and Miss Viner . If they do n’t hit it off it ’s their own affair . What possible motive can you have for trying to interfere now ? ”
79493	79504	79485	79485	Her	1712	“ Why -- naturally , what he says of you ! ”
79505	79551	78966	78966	she	1708	“ I do n’t care a straw what he says of me ! In such a situation a boy in love will snatch at the most far - fetched reason rather than face the mortifying fact that the lady may simply be tired of him . ”
79552	79742	79743	79743	She	1713	“ You don t quite understand Owen . Things go deep with him , and last long . It took him a long time to recover from his other unlucky love affair . He ’s romantic and extravagant : he ca n’t live on the interest of his feelings . He worships Sophy and she seemed to be fond of him . If she ’s changed it ’s been very sudden . And if they part like this , angrily and inarticulately , it will hurt him horribly -- hurt his very soul . But that , as you say , is between the two . What concerns me is his associating you with their quarrel . Owen ’s like my own son -- if you ’d seen him when I first came here you ’d know why . We were like two prisoners who talk to each other by tapping on the wall . He ’s never forgotten it , nor I. Whether he breaks with Sophy , or whether they make it up , I ca n’t let him think you had anything to do with it . ”
79771	79781	79782	79782	he	71	“ I ’ll do whatever you want me to , ”
79785	79796	79782	79782	he	71	“ but I do n’t yet know what it is . ”
79816	79853	79813	79813	her	1713	“ After all , it ’s not so unnatural that Owen , knowing you and Sophy to be almost strangers , should wonder what you were saying to each other when he saw you talking together . ”
79895	79909	79889	79889	his	71	“ Well , my dear -- and could n’t you have told him ? ”
79910	79913	79914	79914	she	1713	“ I ? ”
79921	80082	79914	79914	she	1713	“ You seem to forget , one and all of you , the position you put me in when I came down here : your appeal to me to see Owen through , your assurance to him that I would , Madame de Chantelle ’s attempt to win me over ; and most of all , my own sense of the fact you ’ve just recalled to me : the importance , for both of us , that Owen should like me . It seemed to me that the first thing to do was to get as much light as I could on the whole situation ; and the obvious way of doing it was to try to know Miss Viner better . Of course I ’ve talked with her alone -- I’ve talked with her as often as I could . I ’ve tried my best to find out if you were right in encouraging Owen to marry her . ”
80113	80121	80122	80122	she	1715	“ I see -- I do see , ”
80125	80234	80122	80122	she	1715	“ You must see , also , that I could hardly say this to Owen without offending him still more , and perhaps increasing the breach between Miss Viner and himself . What sort of figure should I cut if I told him I ’d been trying to find out if he ’d made a proper choice ? In any case , it ’s none of my business to offer an explanation of what she justly says does n’t need one . If she declines to speak , it ’s obviously on the ground that Owen ’s insinuations are absurd ; and that surely pledges me to silence . ”
80235	80243	80244	80244	Anna	97	“ Yes , yes ! I see , ”
80247	80260	80244	80244	Anna	97	“ But I do n’t want you to explain anything to Owen . ”
80261	80273	80274	80274	She	97	“ You have n’t yet told me what you do want . ”
80288	80297	80298	80298	she	97	“ I want you to speak to Sophy , ”
80308	80318	80301	80301	Darrow	71	“ Considering what my previous attempts have resulted in---- ! ”
80325	80353	80319	80319	She	97	“ They have n’t , at least , resulted in your liking her less , in your thinking less well of her than you ’ve told me ? ”
80361	80371	80356	80356	he	71	“ I wonder why you go back to that ? ”
80372	80399	80463	80463	he	1718	“ I want to be sure -- I owe it to Owen . Wo n’t you tell me the exact impression she ’s produced on you ? ”
80400	80411	80463	80463	he	1718	“ I have told you -- I like Miss Viner . ”
80412	80424	80356	80356	he	71	“ Do you still believe she ’s in love with Owen ? ”
80425	80441	80463	80463	he	1718	“ There was nothing in our short talks to throw any particular light on that . ”
80442	80461	80463	80463	he	1718	“ You still believe , though , that there ’s no reason why he should n’t marry her ? ”
80469	80484	80463	80463	he	1718	“ How can I answer that without knowing her reasons for breaking with him ? ”
80485	80499	80463	80463	he	1718	“ That ’s just what I want you to find out from her . ”
80500	80511	80463	80463	he	1718	“ And why in the world should she tell me ? ”
80512	80566	80567	80567	Darrow	71	“ Because , whatever grievance she has against Owen , she can certainly have none against me . She ca n’t want to have Owen connect me in his mind with this wretched quarrel ; and she must see that he will until he ’s convinced you ’ve had no share in it . ”
80594	80604	80589	80589	he	71	“ Why ca n’t you tell her this yourself ? ”
80605	80611	80612	80612	He	71	“ Do n’t you see ? ”
80622	80634	80618	80618	she	1720	“ You must have guessed that Owen ’s jealous of you . ”
80635	80640	80589	80589	he	71	“ Jealous of me ? ”
80650	80726	80727	80727	Darrow	71	“ Blind with it -- what else would drive him to this folly ? And I ca n’t have her think me jealous too ! I ’ve said all I could , short of making her think so ; and she ’s refused a word more to either of us . Our only chance now is that she should listen to you -- that you should make her see the harm her silence may do . ”
80733	80762	80727	80727	Darrow	71	“ It ’s all too preposterous -- what you suggest ! I ca n’t , at any rate , appeal to her on such a ground as that ! ”
80771	80837	80765	80765	her	97	“ Appeal to her on the ground that I ’m almost Owen ’s mother , and that any estrangement between you and him would kill me . She knows what he is -- she’ll understand . Tell her to say anything , do anything , she wishes ; but not to go away without speaking , not to leave THAT between us when she goes ! ”
80887	80898	80899	80899	she	97	“ You ’ll see her ? You ’ll see her ? ”
80906	80919	80903	80903	he	71	“ I ’ll do anything in the world you want me to . ”
81187	81199	81177	81177	she	97	“ I was told that Mrs. Leath had sent for me . ”
81200	81225	81226	81226	He	71	“ Mrs. Leath DID send for you . She ’ll be here presently ; but I asked her to let me see you first . ”
81290	81309	81310	81310	She	97	“ You must understand my wanting to speak to you , after what I was told just now . ”
81319	81329	81310	81310	She	97	“ I ’m not responsible for Owen ’s ravings ! ”
81330	81333	81335	81335	He	71	“ Of course---- ”
81377	81387	81388	81388	she	97	“ Well , you ’ve got what you wanted , ”
81391	81401	81388	81388	she	97	“ What do you mean by what I wanted ? ”
81402	81414	81345	81345	She	97	“ My engagement ’s broken -- you heard me say so . ”
81415	81446	81502	81502	Her	97	“ Why do you say that ’s what I wanted ? All I wished , from the beginning , was to advise you , to help you as best I could---- ”
81447	81455	81456	81456	she	97	“ That ’s what you ’ve done , ”
81459	81474	81456	81456	she	97	“ You ’ve convinced me that it ’s best I should n’t marry him . ”
81482	81496	81475	81475	Darrow	71	“ At the very moment when you ’d convinced me to the contrary ! ”
81497	81501	81502	81502	Her	97	“ Had I ? ”
81507	81522	81502	81502	Her	97	“ Well , I really believed it till you showed me ... warned me ... ”
81523	81527	81475	81475	Darrow	71	“ Warned you ? ”
81528	81544	81475	81475	Darrow	71	“ That I ’d be miserable if I married a man I did n’t love . ”
81545	81552	81553	81553	She	97	“ Do n’t you love him ? ”
81631	81654	81625	81625	He	71	“ It ’s rather hard on Owen , is n’t it , that you should have waited until now to tell him ? ”
81662	81672	81655	81655	She	97	“ I told him as soon as I knew . ”
81673	81682	81714	81714	Darrow	71	“ Knew that you could n’t marry him ? ”
81683	81694	81695	81695	She	97	“ Knew that I could never live here with him . ”
81732	81734	81735	81735	she	97	“ Yes---- ”
81765	81772	81773	81774	Sophy Viner	81	“ There -- THAT for instance , ”
81781	81790	81777	81777	Darrow	71	“ It ’s I who ought to go ! ”
81798	81810	81793	81793	her	97	“ What good would that do any of us -- now ? ”
81819	81823	81824	81824	he	71	“ Good God ! ”
81827	81833	81824	81824	he	71	“ How could I tell ? ”
81834	81846	81847	81847	She	97	“ You could n’t tell . We neither of us could . ”
81856	81869	81870	81870	He	71	“ After all , it might have been YOU instead of me ! ”
81924	81928	81929	81929	he	71	“ My dear , ”
81934	81946	81929	81929	he	71	“ ought n’t you , at any rate , to try ? ”
81952	81958	81959	81959	He	71	“ Try to forget you ? ”
81965	82018	81959	81959	He	71	“ I meant , try to give Owen more time ; to give him a chance . He ’s madly in love with you ; all the good that ’s in him is in your hands . His step - mother felt that from the first . And she thought -- she believed---- ”
82019	82034	82117	82117	him	1736	“ She thought I could make him happy . Would she think so now ? ”
82035	82074	82075	82075	he	1736	“ Now ... ? I do n’t say now . But later ? Time modifies ... rubs out ... more quickly than you think ... Go away , but let him hope ... I’m going too -- WE’RE going-- ”
82079	82114	82117	82117	him	1736	plural--“in a very few weeks : going for a long time , probably . What you ’re thinking of now may never happen . We may not all be here together again for years . ”
82135	82139	82140	82140	she	1737	“ For me , ”
82143	82150	82140	82140	she	1737	“ you ’ll always be here . ”
82151	82171	82122	82122	her	1737	“ Do n’t say that -- oh , do n’t ! Things change ... people change ... You’ll see ! ”
82172	82252	82253	82253	She	1737	“ You do n’t understand . I do n’t want anything to change . I do n’t want to forget -- to rub out . At first I imagined I did ; but that was a foolish mistake . As soon as I saw you again I knew it ... It ’s not being here with you that I ’m afraid of -- in the sense you think . It ’s being here , or anywhere , with Owen . ”
82264	82274	82258	82258	her	1737	“ I want to keep you all to myself . ”
82301	82309	82312	82312	himself	1738	“ Poor child -- you poor child ! ”
82333	82347	82348	82348	he	1738	“ Whatever happens , I intend to go -- to go for good , ”
82351	82381	82348	82348	he	1738	“ I want you to understand that . Oh , do n’t be afraid -- I’ll find a reason . But it ’s perfectly clear that I must go . ”
82388	82410	82382	82382	She	1739	“ Go away ? You ? Do n’t you see that that would tell everything -- drag everybody into the horror ? ”
82426	82444	82417	82417	her	1739	“ What good would your going do ? Do you suppose it would change anything for me ? ”
82454	82515	82445	82445	She	1739	“ I wonder what your feeling for me was ? It seems queer that I ’ve never really known -- I suppose we DON’T know much about that kind of feeling . Is it like taking a drink when you ’re thirsty ? ... I used to feel as if all of me was in the palm of your hand ... ”
82529	82743	82523	82523	she	1739	“ Do n’t for a minute think I ’m sorry ! It was worth every penny it cost . My mistake was in being ashamed , just at first , of its having cost such a lot . I tried to carry it off as a joke -- to talk of it to myself as an ‘ adventure ’ . I ’d always wanted adventures , and you ’d given me one , and I tried to take your attitude about it , to ‘ play the game ’ and convince myself that I had n’t risked any more on it than you . Then , when I met you again , I suddenly saw that I HAD risked more , but that I ’d won more , too -- such worlds ! I ’d been trying all the while to put everything I could between us ; now I want to sweep everything away . I ’d been trying to forget how you looked ; now I want to remember you always . I ’d been trying not to hear your voice ; now I never want to hear any other . I ’ve made my choice -- that ’s all : I ’ve had you and I mean to keep you . ”
82752	82760	82761	82761	she	1740	“ To keep you hidden away here , ”
82882	82892	82878	82878	She	1740	“ I wonder what your feeling for me was ? ”
83753	83761	83747	83747	He	71	“ It will rain to - morrow , ”
84289	84295	84284	84284	He	71	“ I must decide on something---- ”
84329	84368	84309	84309	She	97	“ She ’s been with me . She came and found me on the terrace . We ’ve had a long talk and she ’s explained everything . I feel as if I ’d never known her before ! ”
84384	84389	84369	84369	Her	97	“ She ’s explained---- ? ”
84390	84524	84525	84525	Anna	97	“ It ’s natural , is n’t it , that she should have felt a little sore at the kind of inspection she ’s been subjected to ? Oh , not from you -- I do n’t mean that ! But Madame de Chantelle ’s opposition -- and her sending for Adelaide Painter ! She told me frankly she did n’t care to owe her husband to Adelaide Painter ... She thinks now that her annoyance at feeling herself so talked over and scrutinized may have shown itself in her manner to Owen , and set him imagining the insane things he did ... I understand all she must have felt , and I agree with her that it ’s best she should go away for a while . She ’s made me , ”
84529	84543	84525	84525	Anna	97	“ feel as if I ’d been dreadfully thick - skinned and obtuse ! ”
84544	84547	84711	84711	she	97	“ YOU ? ”
84548	84588	84589	84589	She	97	“ Yes . As if I ’d treated her like the bric - a - brac that used to be sent down here ‘ on approval , ’ to see if it would look well with the other pieces . ”
84599	84616	84589	84589	She	97	“ I ’m glad she ’s got it in her to make one feel like that ! ”
84643	84654	84636	84636	he	71	“ Then you think it ’s not a final break ? ”
84655	84709	84711	84711	she	97	“ I hope not -- I’ve never hoped it more ! I had a word with Owen , too , after I left her , and I think he understands that he must let her go without insisting on any positive promise . She ’s excited ... he must let her calm down ... ”
84718	84727	84715	84715	Darrow	71	“ Surely you can make him see that . ”
84728	84801	84809	84809	she	97	“ She ’ll help me to -- she ’s to see him , of course , before she goes . She starts immediately , by the way , with Adelaide Painter , who is motoring over to Francheuil to catch the one o’clock express -- and who , of course , knows nothing of all this , and is simply to be told that Sophy has been sent for by the Farlows . ”
84813	84882	84809	84809	she	97	“ Owen is particularly anxious that neither Adelaide nor his grandmother should have the least inkling of what ’s happened . The need of shielding Sophy will help him to control himself . He ’s coming to his senses , poor boy ; he ’s ashamed of his wild talk already . He asked me to tell you so ; no doubt he ’ll tell you so himself . ”
84890	84905	84883	84883	Darrow	71	“ Oh , as to that -- the thing ’s not worth another word . ”
84906	84913	84914	84914	She	97	“ Or another thought , either ? ”
84917	84938	84914	84914	She	97	“ Promise me you wo n’t even think of it -- promise me you wo n’t be hard on him ! ”
84950	84964	84939	84939	He	71	“ Why should you think it necessary to ask my indulgence for Owen ? ”
84984	84993	84970	84970	her	97	“ Perhaps because I need it for myself . ”
84994	84998	84970	84970	her	97	“ For yourself ? ”
84999	85017	84970	84970	her	97	“ I mean , because I understand better how one can torture one ’s self over unrealities . ”
85111	85117	85118	85118	she	97	“ Do n’t you know , ”
85121	85168	85169	85169	She	97	“ the bliss of waking from a bad dream in one ’s own quiet room , and going slowly over all the horror without being afraid of it any more ? That ’s what I ’m doing now . And that ’s why I understand Owen ... ”
85182	85190	85176	85176	her	97	“ BECAUSE I’D DREAMED THE HORROR TOO ! ”
85199	85202	85193	85193	her	97	“ You ? ”
85203	85263	85264	85264	She	97	“ Forgive me ! And let me tell you ! ... It will help you to understand Owen ... There WERE little things ... little signs ... once I had begun to watch for them : your reluctance to speak about her ... her reserve with you ... a sort of constraint we ’d never seen in her before ... ”
85281	85287	85272	85272	her	97	“ NOW you understand why ? ”
85288	85336	85272	85272	her	97	“ Oh , I understand ; of course I understand ; and I want you to laugh at me -- with me ! Because there were other things too ... crazier things still ... There was even -- last night on the terrace -- her pink cloak ... ”
85337	85342	85350	85350	she	97	“ Her pink cloak ? ”
85356	85430	85353	85353	she	97	“ You ’ve forgotten about the cloak ? The pink cloak that Owen saw you with at the play in Paris ? Yes ... yes ... I was mad enough for that ! ... It does me good to laugh about it now ! But you ought to know that I ’m going to be a jealous woman ... a ridiculously jealous woman ... you ought to be warned of it in time ... ”
85457	85478	85438	85438	she	97	“ I do n’t know why it is ; but it makes me happier now to have been so foolish ! ”
85553	85562	85563	85563	she	97	“ But she WAS with you , then ? ”
85575	85591	85563	85563	she	97	“ Oh , do n’t say no ! Only go and look at your eyes ! ”
85601	85674	85597	85597	she	97	“ Do n’t deny it -- oh , do n’t deny it ! What will be left for me to imagine if you do ? Do n’t you see how every single thing cries it out ? Owen sees it -- he saw it again just now ! When I told him she ’d relented , and would see him , he said : ‘ Is that Darrow ’s doing too ? ’ ”
85844	85935	85841	85841	her	97	“ Do speak at last -- you must speak ! I do n’t want to ask you to harm the girl ; but you must see that your silence is doing her more harm than your answering my questions could . You ’re leaving me only the worst things to think of her ... she ’d see that herself if she were here . What worse injury can you do her than to make me hate her -- to make me feel she ’s plotted with you to deceive us ? ”
85936	85942	85943	85943	Darrow	71	“ Oh , not that ! ”
85958	85968	85969	85969	he	71	“ Yes ; I did see her in Paris , ”
85976	85991	85969	85969	he	71	“ but I was bound to respect her reason for not wanting it known . ”
85995	86005	85969	85969	he	71	“ It was she at the theatre that night ? ”
86006	86017	85969	85969	he	71	“ I was with her at the theatre one night . ”
86018	86030	85969	85969	he	71	“ Why should she have asked you not to say so ? ”
86031	86044	85969	85969	he	71	“ She did n’t wish it known that I ’d met her . ”
86045	86055	85969	85969	he	71	“ Why should n’t she have wished it known ? ”
86056	86101	85969	85969	he	71	“ She had quarrelled with Mrs. Murrett and come over suddenly to Paris , and she did n’t want the Farlows to hear of it . I came across her by accident , and she asked me not to speak of having seen her . ”
86102	86118	85969	85969	he	71	“ Because of her quarrel ? Because she was ashamed of her part in it ? ”
86119	86204	85969	85969	he	71	“ Oh , no . There was nothing for her to be ashamed of . But the Farlows had found the place for her , and she did n’t want them to know how suddenly she ’d had to leave , and how badly Mrs. Murrett had behaved . She was in a terrible plight -- the woman had even kept back her month ’s salary . She knew the Farlows would be awfully upset , and she wanted more time to prepare them . ”
86257	86277	86254	86254	she	97	“ But the Farlows DID know ; they told me all about it when they sent her to me . ”
86291	86301	86282	86282	she	97	“ They may know NOW ; they did n’t then---- ”
86302	86320	86254	86254	she	97	“ That ’s no reason for her continuing now to make a mystery of having met you . ”
86321	86332	86365	86365	her	97	“ It ’s the only reason I can give you . ”
86333	86345	86346	86346	She	97	“ Then I ’ll go and ask her for one myself . ”
86357	86360	86346	86346	She	97	“ Anna ! ”
86372	86378	86361	86361	He	71	“ Do n’t do that ! ”
86379	86383	86346	86346	She	97	“ Why not ? ”
86384	86394	86395	86395	She	97	“ It ’s not like you ... not generous ... ”
86418	86493	86494	86494	She	97	“ I do n’t want to be ungenerous ; I do n’t want to pry into her secrets . But things ca n’t be left like this . Would n’t it be better for me to go to her ? Surely she ’ll understand -- she’ll explain ... It may be some mere trifle she ’s concealing : something that would horrify the Farlows , but that I should n’t see any harm in ... ”
86503	86561	86497	86497	her	97	“ A love affair , I suppose ... that ’s it ? You met her with some man at the theatre -- and she was frightened and begged you to fib about it ? Those poor young things that have to go about among us like machines -- oh , if you knew how I pity them ! ”
86562	86574	86497	86497	her	97	“ If you pity her , why not let her go ? ”
86578	86600	86575	86575	She	97	“ Let her go -- go for good , you mean ? Is that the best you can say for her ? ”
86601	86618	86497	86497	her	97	“ Let things take their course . After all , it ’s between herself and Owen . ”
86619	86662	86663	86663	Darrow	71	“ And you and me -- and Effie , if Owen marries her , and I leave my child with them ! Do n’t you see the impossibility of what you ’re asking ? We ’re all bound together in this coil . ”
86670	86681	86663	86663	Darrow	71	“ Oh , let her go -- let her go . ”
86682	86708	86709	86709	She	1770	“ Then there IS something -- something really bad ? She WAS with some one when you met her ? Some one with whom she was---- ”
86722	86738	86739	86739	she	1770	“ If it ’s THAT , of course ... Oh , do n’t you see , ”
86745	86807	86739	86739	she	1770	“ that I must find out , and that it ’s too late now for you not to speak ? Do n’t be afraid that I ’ll betray you ... I’ll never , never let a soul suspect . But I must know the truth , and surely it ’s best for her that I should find it out from you . ”
86818	86834	86814	86814	he	71	“ What you imagine ’s mere madness . She was at the theatre with me . ”
86835	86839	86814	86814	he	71	“ With you ? ”
86872	86884	86849	86849	she	1770	“ Why should you both have made a mystery of that ? ”
86885	86896	86897	86897	He	71	“ I ’ve told you the idea was not mine . ”
86901	86909	86897	86897	He	71	“ She may have been afraid that Owen---- ”
86910	86940	86941	86941	She	1770	“ But that was not a reason for her asking you to tell me that you hardly knew her -- that you had n’t even seen her for years . ”
86954	86972	86941	86941	She	1770	“ Even if SHE had other reasons , there could be only one reason for your obeying her---- ”
87134	87145	87129	87129	her	97	“ I shall not see her again before she goes . ”
87158	87180	87155	87155	she	97	“ That is why she ’s going , I suppose ? Because she loves you and wo n’t give you up ? ”
87224	87231	87232	87232	he	71	“ She HAS given me up , ”
87254	87265	87266	87266	she	97	“ I must believe him ! I must believe him ! ”
87476	87486	87468	87468	he	71	“ It IS because of you she ’s going ! ”
87680	87691	87692	87692	She	97	“ I must believe him ... I must believe him ... ”
87992	87994	87985	87985	Owen	75	“ Mother!---- ”
88062	88125	88126	88126	He	71	“ It ’s all right ! It ’s all right ! And it ’s all your doing ! I want to do the worst kind of penance -- bell and candle and the rest . I ’ve been through it with HER , and now she hands me on to you , and you ’re to call me any names you please . ”
88134	88168	88130	88130	his	71	“ I ’m to be stood in the corner till next week , and then I ’m to go up to see her . And she says I owe it all to you ! ”
88169	88173	88130	88130	his	71	“ To me ? ”
88197	88224	88225	88225	She	97	“ Yes : you were so patient , and so dear to her ; and you saw at once what a damned ass I ’d been ! ”
88249	88315	88240	88240	he	71	“ That ’s not so difficult to see ? No , I admit it does n’t take a microscope . But you were so wise and wonderful -- you always are . I ’ve been mad these last days , simply mad -- you and she might well have washed your hands of me ! And instead , it ’s all right -- all right ! ”
88358	88380	88381	88381	She	97	“ I ’m so glad , dear ; so glad . If only you ’ll always feel like that about me ... ”
88453	88457	88458	88458	he	71	“ Look here , ”
88461	88479	88458	88458	he	71	“ if Darrow wants to call me a damned ass too you ’re not to stop him ! ”
88509	88523	88458	88458	he	71	“ Oh , you know , he does n’t always wait for orders ! ”
88535	88545	88546	88546	He	71	“ You mean he ’s called me one already ? ”
88555	88575	88576	88576	he	71	“ Well , that saves a lot of trouble ; now we can pass to the order of the day---- ”
88583	88622	88576	88576	he	71	clock--“which is , you know , dear , that she ’s starting in about an hour ; she and Adelaide must already be snatching a hasty sandwich . You ’ll come down to bid them good - bye ? ”
88623	88629	88640	88640	he	71	“ Yes -- of course . ”
88747	88752	88740	88740	Owen	75	“ Are you coming ? ”
88753	88760	88805	88805	his	1791	“ Yes ... yes ... presently . ”
88761	88772	88740	88740	Owen	75	“ What ’s the matter ? You look so strange . ”
88773	88781	88740	88740	Owen	75	“ What do you mean by strange ? ”
88782	88792	88793	88793	She	97	“ I do n’t know : startled -- surprised . ”
88808	88824	88825	88825	He	1791	“ Do I ? No wonder ! You ’ve given us all an exciting morning . ”
88831	88855	88856	88856	He	1791	“ You ’re more excited now that there ’s no cause for it . What on earth has happened since I saw you ? ”
88883	88907	88880	88880	she	97	“ What has happened is simply that I ’m rather tired . Will you ask Sophy to come up and see me here ? ”
88987	88992	88982	88982	She	97	“ I must find out---- ”
89172	89191	89192	89192	she	97	“ I asked you to come up to me because I wanted to say good - bye quietly , ”
89234	89247	89224	89224	Anna	97	“ You ’ve decided , then , not to break your engagement ? ”
89283	89292	89293	89293	she	97	“ I thought that was what you wished , ”
89296	89301	89293	89293	she	97	“ What I wished ? ”
89310	89340	89341	89341	Sophy	81	“ I wish , of course , whatever seems best for Owen ... It ’s natural , you must understand , that that consideration should come first with me ... ”
89348	89361	89341	89341	Sophy	81	“ I supposed it was the only one that counted with you . ”
89372	89376	89377	89377	she	97	“ It is , ”
89431	89456	89428	89428	she	97	“ The suddenness of the change has naturally surprised me . When I left you it was understood that you were to reserve your decision---- ”
89457	89460	89428	89428	she	97	“ Yes . ”
89461	89465	89428	89428	she	97	“ And now---- ? ”
89532	89680	89526	89526	She	97	“ Is n’t it best that we should speak quite frankly ? It ’s this change on your part that perplexes me . You can hardly be surprised at that . It ’s true , I asked you not to break with Owen too abruptly -- and I asked it , believe me , as much for your sake as for his : I wanted you to take time to think over the difficulty that seems to have arisen between you . The fact that you felt it required thinking over seemed to show you would n’t take the final step lightly -- wouldn’t , I mean , accept of Owen more than you could give him . But your change of mind obliges me to ask the question I thought you would have asked yourself . Is there any reason why you should n’t marry Owen ? ”
89696	89708	89687	89687	her	1806	“ Any reason---- ? What do you mean by a reason ? ”
89717	89725	89726	89726	she	97	“ Do you love some one else ? ”
89757	89765	89766	89766	she	1806	“ Ah , you might have waited ! ”
89769	89772	89766	89766	she	1806	“ Waited ? ”
89773	89797	89798	89798	She	1806	“ Till I ’d gone : till I was out of the house . You might have known ... you might have guessed ... ”
89806	89834	89835	89835	she	1806	“ I only meant to let him hope a little longer , so that he should n’t suspect anything ; of course I ca n’t marry him , ”
89898	89904	89905	89905	Sophy	81	“ I ’d better go , ”
89958	89975	89976	89976	Sophy	81	“ I want you to know that no one said anything ... It was I who ... ”
89981	90028	89976	89976	Sophy	81	“ You mean that Mr. Darrow did n’t tell you ? Of course not : do you suppose I thought he did ? You found it out , that ’s all -- I knew you would . In your place I should have guessed it sooner . ”
90077	90086	90087	90087	she	97	“ I ’m so sorry ... so sorry ... ”
90090	90113	90087	90087	she	97	“ Things happen that way . Now I ’d better go . I ’d like to say good - bye to Effie . ”
90114	90116	90123	90125	Effie ’s mother	1813	“ Oh---- ”
90127	90154	90123	90125	Effie ’s mother	1813	“ Not like this -- you must n’t ! I feel -- you make me feel too horribly : as if I were driving you away ... ”
90168	90181	90184	90185	the girl	297	“ No one is driving me away : I had to go , ”
90218	90226	90227	90227	she	97	“ Yes , you must go now , ”
90230	90256	90257	90257	she	97	“ but later on ... after a while , when all this is over ... if there ’s no reason why you should n’t marry Owen---- ”
90264	90277	90257	90257	she	97	“ I should n’t want you to think I stood between you ... ”
90278	90281	90282	90282	Sophy	81	“ You ? ”
90303	90358	90291	90291	She	81	“ Yes ! It was not true when I said just now that I was thinking only of Owen . I ’m sorry -- oh , so sorry!--for you too . Your life -- I know how hard it ’s been ; and mine ... mine ’s so full ... Happy women understand best ! ”
90383	90454	90370	90370	she	97	“ It ’s terrible now ... you see no future ; but if , by and bye ... you know best ... but you ’re so young ... and at your age things DO pass . If there ’s no reason , no real reason , why you should n’t marry Owen , I WANT him to hope , I ’ll help him to hope ... if you say so .... ”
90494	90506	90507	90507	she	97	“ I suppose I ’m not more than half a woman , ”
90510	90522	90525	90525	she	97	“ for I do n’t want my happiness to hurt her ; ”
90528	90539	90525	90525	she	97	“ If only you ’ll tell me there ’s no reason---- ”
90628	90641	90642	90642	Anna	97	“ You ’re going , then -- for good -- like this ? ”
90660	90662	90663	90663	Anna	97	“ Oh---- ”
90690	90712	90686	90686	she	297	“ I wanted it -- I chose it . He was good to me -- no one ever was so good ! ”
90731	90751	90726	90726	Her	297	“ He ’s going too in a few hours -- I need n’t see him again before he leaves ... ”
91076	91079	91080	91080	she	297	Darrow--“May I see you?”--and
91094	91102	91080	91080	she	297	“ Ask Mr. Darrow to come up . ”
91267	91276	91247	91247	he	71	“ He ’s as proud as I am . ”
91281	91288	91278	91278	she	97	“ You wanted to see me ? ”
91289	91292	91293	91293	he	71	“ Naturally , ”
91300	91319	91293	91293	he	71	“ Do n’t ! It ’s useless . I know everything . Nothing you can say will help . ”
91345	91355	91334	91334	he	71	“ You allow me no voice in deciding that ? ”
91356	91360	91372	91372	He	71	“ Deciding what ? ”
91361	91371	91372	91372	He	71	“ That there ’s nothing more to be said ? ”
91384	91398	91372	91372	He	71	“ I do n’t even know what you mean by ‘ everything ’ . ”
91399	91438	91439	91439	Her	97	“ Oh , I do n’t know what more there is ! I know enough . I implored her to deny it , and she couldn’t ... What can you and I have to say to each other ? ”
91472	91491	91464	91464	his	71	“ It must be as you wish ; and yet it ’s not like you to be afraid . ”
91492	91495	91536	91536	he	71	“ Afraid ? ”
91496	91506	91464	91464	his	71	“ To talk things out -- to face them . ”
91507	91519	91464	91464	his	71	“ It ’s for YOU to face this -- not me ! ”
91520	91533	91536	91536	he	71	“ All I ask is to face it -- but with you . ”
91539	91551	91536	91536	he	71	“ Wo n’t you tell me what Miss Viner told you ? ”
91552	91563	91464	91464	his	71	“ Oh , she ’s generous -- to the utmost ! ”
91598	91619	91620	91620	she	97	“ Oh , go , please go . It ’s too horrible . Why should I have to see you ? ”
91716	91724	91725	91725	he	71	“ You want me to leave Givre ? ”
91740	91763	91736	91736	he	71	“ Of course I ’ll do as you wish ; but if I go now am I not to see you again ? ”
91779	91786	91776	91776	She	97	“ You must see it ’s useless---- ”
91787	91800	91736	91736	he	71	“ I might remind you that you ’re dismissing me without a hearing---- ”
91801	91812	91764	91764	His	71	“ Without a hearing ? I ’ve heard you both ! ”
91813	91818	91819	91819	he	71	----“but I wo n’t , ”
91822	91837	91819	91819	he	71	“ remind you of that , or of anything or any one but Owen . ”
91838	91841	91764	91764	His	71	“ Owen ? ”
91842	91851	91852	91852	She	97	“ Yes ; if we could somehow spare him---- ”
91878	91886	91887	91887	Darrow	71	“ You see , do n’t you , ”
91890	91898	91899	91899	She	97	“ that if you send me away now---- ”
91902	91907	91899	91899	She	97	“ Yes , I see---- ”
91925	91940	91919	91919	she	97	“ I do n’t want any one else to suffer as I ’m suffering ... ”
91941	91950	91951	91951	Darrow	71	“ Owen knows I meant to leave tomorrow , ”
91955	91966	91951	91951	Darrow	71	“ Any sudden change of plan may make him think ... ”
92157	92159	92160	92160	His	71	“ Anna---- ”
92167	92187	92160	92160	His	71	“ Let me talk to you quietly . It ’s not worthy of either of us to be afraid . ”
92207	92215	92216	92216	he	71	“ I ’ve no defense to make , ”
92220	92253	92216	92216	he	71	“ The facts are miserable enough ; but at least I want you to see them as they are . Above all , I want you to know the truth about Miss Viner---- ”
92272	92296	92264	92264	She	97	“ Why should I know more of her than what she ’s told me ? I never wish to hear her name again ! ”
92297	92340	92216	92216	he	71	“ It ’s because you feel about her in that way that I ask you -- in the name of common charity -- to let me give you the facts as they are , and not as you ’ve probably imagined them . ”
92341	92365	92264	92264	She	97	“ I ’ve told you I do n’t think uncharitably of her . I do n’t want to think of her at all ! ”
92366	92377	92264	92264	She	97	“ That ’s why I tell you you ’re afraid . ”
92378	92381	92216	92216	he	71	“ Afraid ? ”
92382	92427	92428	92428	He	1833	“ Yes . You ’ve always said you wanted , above all , to look at life , at the human problem , as it is , without fear and without hypocrisy ; and it ’s not always a pleasant thing to look at . ”
92437	92517	92428	92428	He	1833	“ Do n’t think this a plea for myself ! I do n’t want to say a word to lessen my offense . I do n’t want to talk of myself at all . Even if I did , I probably could n’t make you understand -- I do n’t , myself , as I look back . Be just to me -- it ’s your right ; all I ask you is to be generous to Miss Viner ... ”
92523	92537	92518	92518	She	1834	“ You ’re free to be as generous to her as you please ! ”
92538	92575	92428	92428	He	1833	“ Yes : you ’ve made it clear to me that I ’m free . But there ’s nothing I can do for her that will help her half as much as your understanding her would . ”
92576	92589	92590	92590	His	1835	“ Nothing you can do for her ? You can marry her ! ”
92594	92605	92590	92590	His	1835	“ You certainly could n’t wish her a worse fate ! ”
92606	92618	92619	92619	He	1835	“ It must have been what she expected ... relied on ... ”
92628	92651	92624	92624	she	1836	“ Or what is she ? What are you ? It ’s too horrible ! On your way here ... to ME ... ”
92662	92667	92668	92668	he	1835	“ That was it , ”
92677	92819	92672	92672	She	1836	“ I was on my way to you -- after repeated delays and postponements of your own making . At the very last you turned me back with a mere word -- and without explanation . I waited for a letter ; and none came . I ’m not saying this to justify myself . I ’m simply trying to make you understand . I felt hurt and bitter and bewildered . I thought you meant to give me up . And suddenly , in my way , I found some one to be sorry for , to be of use to . That , I swear to you , was the way it began . The rest was a moment ’s folly ... a flash of madness ... as such things are . We ’ve never seen each other since ... ”
92827	92836	92820	92820	Anna	97	“ You sufficiently describe her in saying that ! ”
92837	92858	92880	92880	she	97	“ Yes , if you measure her by conventional standards -- which is what you always declare you never do . ”
92859	92866	92820	92820	Anna	97	“ Conventional standards ? A girl who---- ”
92884	92892	92880	92880	she	97	“ I always thought her an adventuress ! ”
92893	92896	92880	92880	she	97	“ Always ? ”
92897	92909	92880	92880	she	97	“ I do n’t mean always ... but after you came ... ”
92910	92917	92880	92880	she	97	“ She ’s not an adventuress . ”
92918	92941	92880	92880	she	97	“ You mean that she professes to act on the new theories ? The stuff that awful women rave about on platforms ? ”
92942	92955	92880	92880	she	97	“ Oh , I do n’t think she pretended to have a theory---- ”
92956	92964	92880	92880	she	97	“ She had n’t even that excuse ? ”
92965	93057	93058	93058	Anna	97	“ She had the excuse of her loneliness , her unhappiness -- of miseries and humiliations that a woman like you ca n’t even guess . She had nothing to look back to but indifference or unkindness -- nothing to look forward to but anxiety . She saw I was sorry for her and it touched her . She made too much of it -- she exaggerated it . I ought to have seen the danger , but I did n’t . There ’s no possible excuse for what I did . ”
93201	93211	93198	93198	he	1838	“ a moment ’s folly , a flash of madness ”
93259	93265	93268	93268	Darrow	71	“ I swear to you , ”
93271	93281	93268	93268	Darrow	71	“ it was simply that , and nothing more . ”
93400	93413	93396	93396	she	97	“ I do n’t think I understand what you ’ve told me . ”
93414	93422	93423	93423	he	71	“ No ; you do n’t understand , ”
93443	93454	93455	93455	He	71	“ I do n’t want to -- about such things ! ”
93460	93470	93455	93455	He	71	“ Do n’t be afraid ... you never will ... ”
93493	93506	93490	93490	his	71	“ You mean I do n’t feel things -- I’m too hard ? ”
93507	93526	93527	93527	He	71	“ No : you ’re too high ... too fine ... such things are too far from you . ”
93597	93639	93640	93640	He	71	“ It ’s best , on all accounts , that I should stay till tomorrow ; but I need n’t intrude on you ; we need n’t meet again alone . I only want to be sure I know your wishes . ”
93669	93673	93663	93663	Anna	97	“ My wishes ? ”
93674	93678	93681	93681	she	97	“ As to Owen---- ”
93684	93691	93681	93681	she	97	“ They must never meet again ! ”
93692	93714	93715	93715	She	97	“ It ’s not likely they will . What I meant was , that it depends on you to spare him ... ”
93719	93725	93715	93715	She	97	“ He shall never know , ”
93733	93742	93730	93730	Darrow	71	“ This is good - bye , then . ”
93860	93871	93900	93900	he	71	“ I shall never know what that girl has known ... ”
93888	93893	93894	93894	she	97	“ Good - bye , ”
94086	94088	94052	94060	Miss Painter , always hatted and booted for action	1858	“ bowed ”
94471	94474	94464	94464	She	97	“ kept up ”
95666	95669	95647	95647	she	97	“ Give her life”--how
95895	95904	95889	95889	she	97	“ By and bye that will come too . ”
95951	95954	95927	95927	she	97	“ spiritual exercise ”
96049	96055	96041	96041	Anna	97	“ You ’ve found him ? ”
96056	96062	96113	96114	Miss Painter	138	“ I ’ve found Sophy . ”
96063	96074	96113	96114	Miss Painter	138	“ And Owen?--has she seen him ? Is he here ? ”
96075	96091	96041	96041	Anna	97	“ SHE ’S here : in the hall . She wants to speak to you . ”
96092	96097	96098	96098	Anna	97	“ Here -- NOW ? ”
96105	96112	96113	96114	Miss Painter	138	“ She drove back with me , ”
96123	96135	96136	96136	She	97	“ The cabman was impertinent . I ’ve got his number . ”
96144	96149	96152	96152	Anna	97	“ Oh , I can’t-- ”
96176	96199	96200	96200	Anna	97	“ She thought you might be too tired to see her : she would n’t come in till I ’d found out . ”
96230	96238	96239	96239	she	97	“ Ask her to come , please , ”
96352	96364	96335	96335	Anna	97	“ You know where Owen is , Miss Painter tells me . ”
96365	96379	96380	96380	Sophy	81	“ Yes ; that was my reason for asking you to see me . ”
96389	96396	96397	96397	Anna	97	“ I thought he ’d promised you-- ”
96400	96421	96397	96397	Anna	97	“ He did ; but he broke his promise . That ’s what I thought I ought to tell you . ”
96422	96426	96427	96427	Anna	97	“ Thank you . ”
96432	96450	96427	96427	Anna	97	“ He left Givre this morning without a word . I followed him because I was afraid ... ”
96463	96474	96451	96451	She	97	“ You were afraid he ’d guessed ? He HAS ... ”
96475	96484	96427	96427	Anna	97	“ What do you mean -- guessed what ? ”
96485	96504	96451	96451	She	97	“ That you know something he does n’t ... something that made you glad to have me go . ”
96505	96507	96508	96508	Anna	97	“ Oh-- ”
96522	96529	96530	96530	she	97	“ He ’s told you this ? ”
96533	96577	96530	96530	she	97	“ He has n’t told me , because I have n’t seen him . I kept him off -- I made Mrs. Farlow get rid of him . But he ’s written me what he came to say ; and that was it . ”
96578	96584	96587	96587	Anna	97	“ Oh , poor Owen ! ”
96604	96612	96613	96614	the girl	297	“ And I want to ask you , ”
96617	96628	96629	96629	she	297	“ to let me see him ; for of course , ”
96639	96647	96629	96629	she	297	“ I would n’t unless you consented . ”
96648	96653	96654	96654	Anna	97	“ To see him ? ”
96663	96676	96629	96629	she	297	“ What use would it be ? What could you tell him ? ”
96677	96686	96688	96689	Sophy Viner	81	“ I want to tell him the truth , ”
96709	96715	96716	96716	she	97	“ I do n’t understand , ”
96732	96747	96725	96725	she	97	“ I do n’t want him to think worse of me than he need ... ”
96748	96751	96725	96725	she	97	“ Worse ? ”
96752	96784	96785	96785	Anna	97	“ Yes -- to think such things as you ’re thinking now ... I want him to know exactly what happened ... then I want to bid him good - bye . ”
96804	96813	96798	96798	She	97	“ Would n’t it be worse for him ? ”
96814	96835	96842	96842	Anna	97	“ To hear the truth ? It would be better , at any rate , for you and Mr. Darrow . ”
96848	96859	96842	96842	Anna	97	“ I ’ve only my step - son to consider ! ”
96869	96883	96860	96861	The girl	297	“ You do n’t mean -- you’re not going to give him up ? ”
96890	96905	96860	96861	The girl	297	“ I do n’t think it ’s of any use to talk of that . ”
96906	96986	96987	96987	She	297	“ Oh , I know ! It ’s my fault for not knowing how to say what I want you to hear . Your words are different ; you know how to choose them . Mine offend you ... and the dread of it makes me blunder . That ’s why , the other day , I could n’t say anything ... could n’t make things clear to you . But now MUST , even if you hate it ! ”
97004	97045	96993	96993	her	297	“ Do listen to me ! What you ’ve said is dreadful . How can you speak of him in that voice ? Do n’t you see that I went away so that he should n’t have to lose you ? ”
97052	97079	97046	97046	Anna	97	“ Are you speaking of Mr. Darrow ? I do n’t know why you think your going or staying can in any way affect our relations . ”
97080	97108	97109	97110	the girl	297	“ You mean that you HAVE given him up -- because of me ? Oh , how could you ? You ca n’t really love him!--And yet , ”
97114	97127	97109	97110	the girl	297	“ you must , or you ’d be more sorry for me ! ”
97128	97136	97137	97137	Anna	97	“ I ’m very sorry for you , ”
97157	97184	97109	97110	the girl	297	“ Then why wo n’t you hear me ? Why wo n’t you try to understand ? It ’s all so different from what you imagine ! ”
97185	97192	97109	97110	the girl	297	“ I ’ve never judged you . ”
97193	97205	97109	97110	the girl	297	“ I ’m not thinking of myself . He loves you ! ”
97206	97217	97109	97110	the girl	297	“ I thought you ’d come to speak of Owen . ”
97226	97253	97218	97219	Sophy Viner	81	“ He ’s never loved any one else . Even those few days ... I knew it all the while ... he never cared for me . ”
97254	97262	97263	97263	Anna	97	“ Please do n’t say any more ! ”
97266	97423	97263	97263	Anna	97	“ I know it must seem strange to you that I should say so much . I shock you , I offend you : you think me a creature without shame . So I am -- but not in the sense you think ! I ’m not ashamed of having loved him ; no ; and I ’m not ashamed of telling you so . It ’s that that justifies me -- and him too ... Oh , let me tell you how it happened ! He was sorry for me : he saw I cared . I KNEW that was all he ever felt . I could see he was thinking of some one else . I knew it was only for a week ... He never said a word to mislead me ... I wanted to be happy just once -- and I did n’t dream of the harm I might be doing him ! ”
97472	97479	97480	97480	She	97	“ I am sorry for you . ”
97483	97493	97480	97480	She	97	“ But why do you say this to me ? ”
97500	97511	97497	97497	she	97	“ You ’d no right to let Owen love you . ”
97512	97651	97652	97652	Anna	97	“ No ; that was wrong . At least what ’s happened since has made it so . If things had been different I think I could have made Owen happy . You were all so good to me -- I wanted so to stay with you ! I suppose you ’ll say that makes it worse : my daring to dream I had the right ... But all that does n’t matter now . I wo n’t see Owen unless you ’re willing . I should have liked to tell him what I ’ve tried to tell you ; but you must know better ; you feel things in a finer way . Only you ’ll have to help him if I ca n’t . He cares a great deal ... it ’s going to hurt him ... ”
97655	97666	97652	97652	Anna	97	“ Oh , I know ! What can I do ? ”
97667	97692	97795	97795	her	81	“ You can go straight back to Givre -- now , at once ! So that Owen shall never know you ’ve followed him . ”
97701	97757	97693	97693	Sophy	81	“ And you can send for Mr. Darrow -- bring him back . Owen must be convinced that he ’s mistaken , and nothing else will convince him . Afterward I ’ll find a pretext -- oh , I promise you ! But first he must see for himself that nothing ’s changed for you . ”
97776	97791	97792	97792	Sophy	81	“ Oh , ca n’t I move you ? Some day you ’ll know ! ”
97850	97856	97857	97857	she	97	“ I do believe you , ”
98286	98304	98305	98305	he	71	“ Of all the ways you do your hair , that ’s the way I like best , ”
98532	98558	98525	98525	Darrow	71	“ Will you let me see you ? I ’ve come back -- I had to come . Miss Painter told me you were here . ”
98588	98594	98585	98585	him	71	“ I ca n’t hear . ”
98597	98600	98595	98595	She	97	“ Yes ! ”
98622	98624	98639	98639	she	97	“ Yes ”
98713	98719	98708	98708	she	97	“ He is n’t coming . ”
98742	98753	98739	98739	She	97	“ Can he imagine there ’s any use in coming ? ”
98863	98867	98868	98868	he	71	“ Thank you , ”
98878	98885	98875	98875	She	97	“ It ’s better , I suppose---- ”
99051	99058	99059	99059	he	71	“ I had to see you , ”
99073	99081	99059	99059	he	71	“ Yes ; we must think of Owen---- ”
99082	99087	99088	99088	Her	97	“ Oh , Owen-- ! ”
99191	99204	99207	99207	him	71	“ I ’ve come to talk of myself , not of Owen , ”
99210	99259	99207	99207	him	71	“ When you sent me away the other day I understood that it could n’t be otherwise -- then . But it ’s not possible that you and I should part like that . If I ’m to lose you , it must be for a better reason . ”
99260	99265	99370	99370	He	71	“ A better reason ? ”
99266	99310	99377	99377	she	97	“ Yes : a deeper one . One that means a fundamental disaccord between us . This one doesn’t -- in spite of everything it does n’t . That ’s what I want you to see , and have the courage to acknowledge . ”
99311	99322	99207	99207	him	71	“ If I saw it I should have the courage ! ”
99323	99343	99370	99370	He	71	“ Yes : courage was the wrong word . You have that . That ’s why I ’m here . ”
99344	99352	99353	99353	she	97	“ But I do n’t see it , ”
99357	99369	99353	99353	she	97	“ So it ’s useless , is n’t it?--and so cruel ... ”
99381	99390	99377	99377	she	97	“ I shall never understand it -- never ! ”
99396	99408	99391	99391	He	71	“ You will some day : you were made to feel everything ”
99409	99421	99377	99377	she	97	“ I should have thought this was a case of not feeling---- ”
99422	99430	99431	99431	He	71	“ On my part , you mean ? ”
99436	99534	99431	99431	He	71	“ Yes , it was : to my shame ... What I meant was that when you ’ve lived a little longer you ’ll see what complex blunderers we all are : how we ’re struck blind sometimes , and mad sometimes -- and then , when our sight and our senses come back , how we have to set to work , and build up , little by little , bit by bit , the precious things we ’d smashed to atoms without knowing it . Life ’s just a perpetual piecing together of broken bits . ”
99540	99551	99535	99535	She	97	“ That ’s what I feel : that you ought to---- ”
99562	99607	99552	99552	He	71	“ Oh , don’t -- don’t say what you ’re going to ! Men do n’t give their lives away like that . If you wo n’t have mine , it ’s at least my own , to do the best I can with . ”
99608	99640	99641	99641	He	71	“ The best you can -- that ’s what I mean ! How can there be a ‘ best ’ for you that ’s made of some one else ’s worst ? ”
99649	99721	99722	99722	She	97	“ I do n’t know ! It seemed such a slight thing -- all on the surface -- and I ’ve gone aground on it because it was on the surface . I see the horror of it just as you do . But I see , a little more clearly , the extent , and the limits , of my wrong . It ’s not as black as you imagine . ”
99729	99744	99722	99722	She	97	“ I suppose I shall never understand ; but she seems to love you ... ”
99745	99824	99724	99724	her	97	“ There ’s my shame ! That I did n’t guess it , did n’t fly from it . You say you ’ll never understand : but why should n’t you ? Is it anything to be proud of , to know so little of the strings that pull us ? If you knew a little more , I could tell you how such things happen without offending you ; and perhaps you ’d listen without condemning me . ”
99825	99832	99833	99833	She	97	“ I do n’t condemn you . ”
99846	99861	99840	99840	She	97	“ I DO understand ! I ’ve understood ever since you ’ve been here ! ”
99971	99982	99983	99983	she	97	“ Oh , I do n’t know what to think ! ”

100069	100102	100103	100103	He	1950	“ You do know ! We ’ve often talked of such things : of the monstrousness of useless sacrifices . If I ’m to expiate , it ’s not in that way . ”
100107	100119	100103	100103	He	1950	“ It ’s in having to say this to you now ... ”
100147	100150	100151	100151	she	97	“ Owen ! ”
100155	100161	100162	100162	She	97	“ Is Owen in Paris ? ”

100287	100311	100312	100312	He	1950	“ You furtive person ! I ran across the omniscient Adelaide and heard from her that you ’d rushed up suddenly and secretly . ”
100327	100336	100337	100337	Anna	97	“ I came up to meet Mr. Darrow , ”
100340	100354	100337	100337	Anna	97	“ His leave ’s been prolonged -- he ’s going back with me . ”

100561	100596	100558	100558	he	71	“ For you know that , much as I ’m ready to do for Owen , I ca n’t do that for him -- I ca n’t go back to be sent away again . ”
100597	100602	100603	100603	He	71	“ No -- no ! ”

Or perhaps he has forgotten it all as completely as I have forgotten everything that happened to me before he came ... ”
104680	104703	104672	104672	She	97	“ He wo n’t grow any older because he does n’t feel things ; and because he does n’t , I SHALL ... ”

104937	104956	104934	104934	he	71	“ You ’ll tell me before I go what day I ’m to come back and get you ? ”
104990	105012	104986	104986	she	97	“ There ’s something I ’ve been wanting you to know . The other day in Paris I saw Miss Viner . ”
105024	105030	105013	105013	She	97	“ You sent for her ? ”
105031	105070	105071	105071	Darrow	71	“ No ; she heard from Adelaide that I was in Paris and she came . She came because she wanted to urge me to marry you . I thought you ought to know what she had done . ”
105075	105084	105085	105085	He	71	“ I ’m glad you ’ve told me . ”
105103	105108	105109	105109	he	71	“ Is that all ? ”
105115	105124	105109	105109	he	71	“ It seems to me a great deal . ”

105155	105167	105168	105168	He	71	“ Oh , it was for your sake , I know ! ”
105177	105192	105174	105174	she	2050	“ She ’s been exceedingly generous ... Why should n’t we speak of it ? ”
105216	105226	105204	105204	she	2050	“ I ’ve not shrunk from speaking of it . ”
105227	105254	105255	105255	She	2050	“ Speaking of her , then , I mean . It seems to me that if I could talk to you about her I should know better---- ”
105265	105275	105262	105262	he	71	“ What is it you want to know better ? ”
105395	105434	105435	105435	she	2050	“ I think I only wanted to speak her name . It ’s not right that we should seem so afraid of it . If I were really afraid of it I should have to give you up , ”
105448	105459	105460	105460	he	71	“ Ah , you ca n’t give me up now ! ”
105492	105505	105486	105486	her	2050	“ How can I help it , when I AM so afraid ? ”

106426	106429	106430	106430	she	97	“ Perhaps , ”
106433	106443	106430	106430	she	97	“ it will be easier to tell him there . ”

107172	107194	107195	107195	He	71	“ I must be off by the early train . There wo n’t be more than a moment in the morning . ”
107276	107287	107288	107288	he	71	“ You ’ll tell me to - night , dear , ”
107302	107311	107312	107312	she	97	“ There ’s something I must ask you , ”
107349	107358	107345	107345	she	97	“ Do such things happen to men often ? ”
107387	107406	107380	107380	he	71	“ I do n’t know what happens to other men . Such a thing never happened to me ... ”
107443	107458	107413	107413	his	71	“ Had it ... had it begun ... before you met her in Paris ? ”
107459	107477	107413	107413	his	71	“ No ; a thousand times no ! I ’ve told you the facts as they were . ”
107478	107483	107484	107484	He	71	“ All the facts ? ”
107488	107494	107484	107484	He	71	“ What do you mean ? ”
107508	107526	107527	107527	She	97	“ I mean -- about her ... Perhaps you knew ... knew things about her ... beforehand . ”
107558	107566	107567	107567	he	71	“ I knew nothing , absolutely nothing , ”
107630	107635	107636	107636	he	71	“ Is that all ? ”
107655	107665	107639	107639	She	97	“ Then is this to be good - bye ? ”
107685	107694	107695	107695	He	71	“ You understand that I sha’n’t come back ? ”
107838	107850	107833	107833	she	97	“ I shall see you to - morrow before you go ... ”

109509	109523	109524	109524	he	71	“ That ’s a good plan ; the best thing that could happen , ”
109537	109542	109543	109543	she	97	“ Oh , yes , ”
109605	109613	109614	109614	she	97	“ I shall see him this evening , ”
109633	109646	109614	109614	she	97	“ Yes , of course ; perhaps he might dine with you . ”
109722	109731	109717	109717	her	97	“ I ’m afraid he ’s desperately unhappy . ”
109741	109753	109732	109732	He	71	“ It ’s much the best thing that he should travel . ”
109754	109763	109764	109764	She	97	“ Yes -- but do n’t you feel ... ”
109809	109827	109804	109804	She	97	“ He will see the change , and grow indifferent to me as he did to HER ... ”

110432	110441	110442	110442	she	97	“ Dearest -- so you ’re really off ? ”
110524	110536	110521	110521	she	97	“ I ’m so glad Fred Rempson can go with you . ”

110788	110805	110780	110780	He	71	“ I ’m half - blind with neuralgia . I suppose it ’s this beastly rain . ”
110806	110820	110821	110821	She	97	“ Yes ; it will do you good to get down to Spain . ”

111067	111096	111062	111062	He	71	“ I mean -- I may not be here . I ’ve got to go and pick up Rempson , and see about some final things with him . ”
111151	111154	111155	111155	she	97	“ Owen ! ”

111186	111208	111209	111209	He	71	“ How long ? Oh , you see ... that ’s rather vague ... I hate definite dates , you know ... ”
111228	111237	111223	111223	She	97	“ You ’ll be here for my wedding ? ”
111252	111262	111249	111249	she	97	“ In six weeks I shall be going too ... ”
111279	111289	111269	111269	he	71	“ Oh , by that time , very likely ... ”
111290	111303	111304	111304	she	97	“ At any rate , I wo n’t say good - bye , ”
111314	111322	111323	111323	he	71	“ No , no ; rather not ! ”
111343	111353	111333	111333	she	97	“ You ’ll write me , wo n’t you ? ”

112808	112819	112820	112820	he	71	“ This is ever so much better than the theatre , ”
112911	112921	112922	112922	she	97	“ After the theatre they came home like this , ”
112941	112949	112950	112950	she	97	“ Don’t -- oh , do n’t ! ”
112974	112984	112959	112959	She	97	“ Anna ! What on earth is the matter ? ”

113035	113045	113002	113002	Darrow	71	“ You had a talk with him this afternoon ? ”
113046	113065	113066	113066	She	97	“ Yes : for a few minutes . I could see he did n’t want me to stay . ”
113135	113142	113132	113132	he	71	“ Had he seen Miss Viner ? ”
113152	113167	113143	113143	She	97	“ No ... I do n’t think so ... I’m sure he had n’t ... ”
113205	113219	113191	113191	He	71	“ I think you ought to tell me what you mean to do . ”

113240	113252	113253	113253	He	71	“ No ; but things ca n’t go on like this . ”
113263	113270	113271	113271	he	71	“ I fill you with aversion , ”
113282	113289	113274	113274	She	97	“ No -- oh , no ! ”
113290	113301	113302	113302	She	97	“ Poor child -- you ca n’t see your face ! ”

Whenever you see me you remember ... you associate me with things you abhor ... You’ve been generous -- immeasurably . You ’ve given me all the chances a woman could ; but if it ’s only made you suffer , what ’s the use ? ”
113450	113458	113362	113362	he	71	“ It has n’t only done that . ”
113459	113471	113472	113472	He	71	“ Oh , no ! I know ... There’ve been moments ... ”
113483	113518	113472	113472	He	71	“ They ’ll be with me as long as I live . But I ca n’t see you paying such a price for them . I ’m not worth what I ’m costing you . ”

113553	113558	113533	113533	she	97	“ Anna -- Anna ! ”
113559	113635	113636	113636	She	2216	“ Yes ; I want to know now : to know everything . Perhaps that will make me forget . I ought to have made you tell me before . Wherever we go , I imagine you ’ve been there with her ... I see you together . I want to know how it began , where you went , why you left her ... I ca n’t go on in this darkness any longer ! ”
113665	113672	113673	113673	she	2216	“ I want to know everything , ”
113676	113687	113673	113673	she	2216	“ It ’s the only way to make me forget . ”
113718	113727	113709	113709	She	2216	“ Are n’t you going to tell me ? ”
113728	113731	113709	113709	She	2216	“ No . ”
113739	113747	113709	113709	She	2216	“ You wo n’t ? Why not ? ”
113748	113761	113709	113709	She	2216	“ If I did , do you suppose you ’d forget THAT ? ”
113762	113764	113765	113765	she	2216	“ Oh-- ”
113774	113781	113782	113782	he	71	“ You see it ’s impossible , ”
113786	113824	113782	113782	he	71	“ I ’ve done a thing I loathe , and to atone for it you ask me to do another . What sort of satisfaction would that give you ? It would put something irremediable between us . ”
113878	113890	113876	113876	her	2216	“ Should I be at peace if I gave him up ? ”
113928	113933	113936	113936	him	2217	“ Good - bye , ”
113969	113985	113964	113964	She	2216	“ This is the end ... he wo n’t try to appeal to me again ... ”
114026	114044	114017	114017	she	2216	“ Why , he ’s mine -- he ’s mine ! He ’s no one else ’s ! ”
114473	114485	114486	114486	Anna	97	“ She ’s kept faith with herself and I have n’t , ”
115289	115294	115295	115295	he	2246	“ Just a minute , ”
115298	115307	115308	115308	He	2246	“ I think the masseur ’s with her . ”
115450	115456	115437	115437	he	2246	“ She ’s perfectly hopeless , ”
115499	115517	115518	115518	He	2246	“ She says it ’s all right , if you do n’t mind seeing her in bed . ”
115576	115601	115602	115603	Mrs. Birch	165	“ You do n’t mind , do you ? He costs such a frightful lot that I ca n’t afford to send him off , ”
115684	115715	115678	115678	herself	165	“ If you ’d just give him a caramel ... there , in that box on the dressing - table ... it ’s the only earthly thing to stop him ... ”
115745	115771	115772	115772	she	97	“ Is n’t he a beauty ? The Prince gave him to me down at Nice the other day -- but he ’s perfectly awful , ”
115886	115900	115901	115901	she	97	“ Do sit down , if there ’s a place to sit on , ”
115920	115949	115908	115908	Anna	97	“ My singing takes so much time that I do n’t get a chance to walk the fat off -- that ’s the worst of being an artist . ”
115955	115971	115950	115950	Anna	97	“ I hope it has n’t inconvenienced you to see me ; I told Mr. Birch-- ”
115972	115976	115901	115901	she	97	“ Mr. WHO ? ”
115985	115990	115991	115991	she	97	“ Oh , JIMMY ! ”
116011	116046	116006	116007	The latter	231	“ I understand from Mrs. Farlow that your sister was with you , and I ventured to come up because I wanted to ask you when I should have a chance of finding her . ”
116060	116082	116053	116053	her	165	“ Do you mean to say the idiot at the door did n’t tell you ? Sophy went away last night . ”
116083	116087	116088	116088	Anna	97	“ Last night ? ”
116135	116162	116126	116126	she	97	“ The porter did tell me , but I thought perhaps he was mistaken . Mrs. Farlow seemed to think that I should find her here . ”
116163	116205	116263	116266	Mrs. McTarvie - Birch	165	“ It was all so sudden that I do n’t suppose she had time to let the Farlows know . She did n’t get Mrs. Murrett ’s wire till yesterday , and she just pitched her things into a trunk and rushed---- ”
116206	116210	116263	116266	Mrs. McTarvie - Birch	165	“ Mrs. Murrett ? ”
116211	116232	116233	116233	Sophy	81	“ Why , yes . Sophy ’s gone to India with Mrs. Murrett ; they ’re to meet at Brindisi , ”
116269	116326	116263	116266	Mrs. McTarvie - Birch	165	“ They had a fearful kick - up last spring -- I daresay you knew about it -- but I told Sophy she ’d better lump it , as long as the old woman was willing to ... As an artist , of course , it ’s perfectly impossible for me to have her with me ... ”
116327	116331	116332	116332	Anna	97	“ Of course , ”
116356	116417	116348	116349	Mrs. Birch	165	“ Naturally I did n’t altogether approve of her going back to that beast of a woman . I said all I could ... I told her she was a fool to chuck up such a place as yours . But Sophy ’s restless -- always was -- and she ’s taken it into her head she ’d rather travel ... ”
116488	116501	116471	116472	Mrs. Birch	165	“ Do come again ! I ’d love to sing to you . ”
116526	116537	116520	116521	her hostess	1860	“ Jimmy ! Do you hear me ? Jimmy BRANCE ! ”
116550	116564	116520	116521	her hostess	1860	“ DO tell him he must go and call the lift for you ! ”
