2	8	1	1	I.	433	“ HASTE TO THE WEDDING . ”
9	17	23	23	Margaret	123	“ Wooed and married and a ’ . ”
18	21	23	23	Margaret	123	“ Edith ! ”
27	30	23	23	Margaret	123	“ Edith ! ”
778	865	906	906	she	126	“ I suffered too much myself ; not that I was not extremely happy with the poor dear General , but still disparity of age is a drawback ; one that I was resolved Edith should not have to encounter . Of course , without any maternal partiality , I foresaw that the dear child was likely to marry early ; indeed , I had often said that I was sure she would be married before she was nineteen . I had quite prophetic feeling when Captain Lennox”—and
1196	1206	1191	1191	she	131	“ I have spared no expense in her trousseau , ”
1214	1238	1191	1191	she	131	“ She has all the beautiful Indian shawls and scarfs the General gave to me , but which I shall never wear again . ”
1239	1246	1258	1259	Mrs. Gibson	129	“ She is a lucky girl , ”
1290	1347	1258	1259	Mrs. Gibson	129	“ Helen had set her heart upon an Indian shawl , but really when I found what an extravagant price was asked , I was obliged to refuse her . She will be quite envious when she hears of Edith having Indian shawls . What kind are they ? Delhi ? with the lovely little borders ? ”
1388	1393	1395	1395	she	446	“ Edith ! Edith ! ”
1412	1427	1408	1408	Margaret	123	“ Edith is asleep , Aunt Shaw . Is it anything I can do ? ”
1432	1436	1428	1430	All the ladies	492	“ poor child ! ”
1469	1510	1452	1453	Mrs. Shaw	126	“ Hush , Tiny ! you naughty little girl ! you will waken your mistress . It was only to ask Edith if she would tell Newton to bring down her shawls ; perhaps you would go , Margaret dear ? ”
1990	1994	1996	1996	she	123	“ Ah Newton ! ”
1998	2013	1996	1996	she	123	“ I think we shall all be sorry to leave this dear old room . ”
2014	2074	1996	1996	she	123	“ Indeed , miss , I sha n’t for one . My eyes are not so good as they were , and the light here is so bad that I ca n’t see to mend laces except just at the window , where there ’s always a shocking draught — enough to give one one ’s death of cold . ”
2075	2122	2124	2124	Margaret	123	“ Well , I dare say you will have both good light and plenty of warmth at Naples . You must keep as much of your darning as you can till then . Thank you , Newton , I can take them down — you’re busy . ”
2776	2823	2756	2756	She	123	“ Well , I suppose you are all in the depth of business — ladies ’ business , I mean . Very different to my business , which is the real true law business . Playing with shawls is very different work to drawing up settlements . ”
2824	2856	2756	2756	She	123	“ Ah , I knew how you would be amused to find us all so occupied in admiring finery . But really Indian shawls are very perfect things of their kind . ”
2857	2876	2877	2878	The gentlemen	473	“ I have no doubt they are . Their prices are very perfect , too . Nothing wanting . ”
2895	2915	2877	2878	The gentlemen	473	“ This is your last dinner - party , is it not ? There are no more before Thursday ? ”
2916	2993	2756	2756	She	123	“ No . I think after this evening we shall feel at rest , which I am sure I have not done for many weeks ; at least , that kind of rest when the hands have nothing more to do , and all the arrangements are complete for an event which must occupy one ’s head and heart . I shall be glad to have time to think , and I am sure Edith will . ”
2994	3033	2756	2756	She	123	“ I am not so sure about her , but I can fancy that you will . Whenever I have seen you lately , you have been carried away by a whirlwind of some other person ’s making . ”
3034	3037	3039	3039	Margaret	123	“ Yes , ”
3064	3100	3039	3039	Margaret	123	“ I wonder if a marriage must always be preceded by what you call a whirlwind , or whether in some cases there might not rather be a calm and peaceful time just before it . ”
3101	3123	3125	3126	Mr. Lennox	135	“ Cinderella ’s godmother ordering the trousseau , the wedding - breakfast , writing the notes of invitation , for instance , ”
3130	3139	3141	3141	Margaret	123	“ But are all these quite necessary troubles ? ”
3207	3213	3214	3214	he	135	“ Oh , of course , ”
3225	3272	3214	3214	he	135	“ There are forms and ceremonies to be gone through , not so much to satisfy oneself , as to stop the world ’s mouth , without which stoppage there would be very little satisfaction in life . But how would you have a wedding arranged ? ”
3273	3347	3222	3222	his	135	“ Oh , I have never thought much about it ; only I should like it to be a very fine summer morning ; and I should like to walk to church through the shade of trees ; and not to have so many bridesmaids , and to have no wedding - breakfast . I dare say I am resolving against the very things that have given me the most trouble just now . ”
3348	3369	3222	3222	his	135	“ No , I do n’t think you are . The idea of stately simplicity accords well with your character . ”
3428	3463	3419	3419	She	123	“ It is natural for me to think of Helstone church , and the walk to it , rather than of driving up to a London church in the middle of a paved street . ”
3464	3528	3419	3419	She	123	“ Tell me about Helstone . You have never described it to me . I should like to have some idea of the place you will be living in , when ninety - six Harley Street will be looking dingy and dirty , and dull , and shut up . Is Helstone a village , or a town , in the first place ? ”
3529	3574	3419	3419	She	123	“ Oh , only a hamlet ; I do n’t think I could call it a village at all . There is the church and a few houses near it on the green — cottages , rather — with roses growing all over them . ”
3575	3592	3594	3594	he	563	“ And flowering all the year round , especially at Christmas — make your picture complete , ”
3596	3599	3601	3601	Margaret	123	“ No , ”
3606	3632	3601	3601	Margaret	123	“ I am not making a picture . I am trying to describe Helstone as it really is . You should not have said that . ”
3633	3638	3639	3639	he	563	“ I am penitent , ”
3642	3659	3639	3639	he	563	“ Only it really sounded like a village in a tale rather than in real life . ”
3660	3666	3668	3668	Margaret	123	“ And so it is , ”
3672	3744	3668	3668	Margaret	123	“ All the other places in England that I have seen seem so hard and prosaic - looking , after the New Forest . Helstone is like a village in a poem — in one of Tennyson ’s poems . But I wo n’t try and describe it any more . You would only laugh at me if I told you what I think of it — what it really is . ”
3745	3785	3639	3639	he	563	“ Indeed , I would not . But I see you are going to be very resolved . Well , then , tell me that which I should like still better to know : what the parsonage is like . ”
3786	3810	3639	3639	he	563	“ Oh , I ca n’t describe my home . It is home , and I ca n’t put its charm into words . ”
3811	3825	3668	3668	Margaret	123	“ I submit . You are rather severe to - night , Margaret . ”
3826	3829	3831	3831	she	564	“ How ? ”
3843	3851	3831	3831	she	564	“ I did not know I was . ”
3852	3899	3668	3668	Margaret	123	“ Why , because I made an unlucky remark , you will neither tell me what Helstone is like , nor will you say anything about your home , though I have told you how much I want to hear about both , the latter especially . ”
3900	3932	3668	3668	Margaret	123	“ But indeed I can not tell you about my own home . I do n’t quite think it is a thing to be talked about , unless you knew it . ”
3933	3936	3831	3831	she	564	“ Well , then”—pausing
3939	4010	3668	3668	Margaret	123	moment—“tell me what you do there . Here you read , or have lessons , or otherwise improve your mind , till the middle of the day ; take a walk before lunch , go a drive with your aunt after , and have some kind of engagement in the evening . There , now fill up your day at Helstone . Shall you ride , drive , or walk ? ”
4011	4056	3668	3668	Margaret	123	“ Walk , decidedly . We have no horse , not even for papa . He walks to the very extremity of his parish . The walks are so beautiful , it would be a shame to drive — almost a shame to ride . ”
4057	4079	3668	3668	Margaret	123	“ Shall you garden much ? That , I believe , is a proper employment for young ladies in the country . ”
4080	4097	3668	3668	Margaret	123	“ I do n’t know . I am afraid I sha n’t like such hard work . ”
4098	4110	3668	3668	Margaret	123	“ Archery parties — picnics — race balls — hunt balls ? ”
4111	4115	4117	4117	she	566	“ Oh no ! ”
4121	4147	4117	4117	she	566	“ Papa ’s living is very small ; and even if we were near such things , I doubt if I should go to them . ”
4148	4199	3668	3668	Margaret	123	“ I see , you wo n’t tell me anything . You will only tell me that you are not going to do this and that . Before the vacation ends , I think I shall pay you a call , and see what you really do employ yourself in . ”
4200	4257	4258	4258	Edith	131	“ I hope you will . Then you will see for yourself how beautiful Helstone is . Now I must go . Edith is sitting down to play , and I just know enough of music to turn over the leaves for her ; and , besides , Aunt Shaw wo n’t like us to talk . ”
5004	5043	5044	5046	MRS . HEMANS	141	“ By the soft green light in the woody glade , On the banks of moss where thy childhood played By the household tree , thro ’ which thine eye First looked in love to the summer sky . ”
5326	5343	5318	5318	she	126	“ Married for love , what can dearest Maria have to wish for in this world ? ”
5362	5392	5348	5348	she	142	“ a silver - grey glacé silk , a white chip bonnet , oh ! dozens of things for the wedding , and hundreds of things for the house . ”
5791	5795	5797	5797	she	123	“ Poor Frederick ! ”
5801	5886	5797	5797	she	123	“ Oh ! if Frederick had but been a clergyman , instead of going into the navy , and being lost to us all ! I wish I knew all about it . I never understood it from Aunt Shaw ; I only knew he could not come back to England because of that terrible affair . Poor dear papa ! how sad he looks ! I am so glad I am going home , to be at hand to comfort him and mamma . ”
6058	6060	6041	6041	Her	123	“ yes ”
6062	6065	6041	6041	Her	123	“ no , ”
6067	6074	6041	6041	Her	123	“ an’t please you , sir . ”
6969	6988	6990	6991	Mrs. Hale	142	“ It is undoubtedly one of the most out - of - the - way places in England , ”
7000	7078	6990	6991	Mrs. Hale	142	“ I ca n’t help regretting constantly that papa has really no one to associate with here ; he is so thrown away ; seeing no one but farmers and labourers from week ’s end to week ’s end . If we only lived at the other side of the parish , it would be something ; there we should be almost within walking distance of the Stansfields ; certainly the Gormons would be within a walk . ”
7079	7082	7084	7084	Margaret	123	“ Gormons , ”
7086	7137	7084	7084	Margaret	123	“ Are those the Gormons who made their fortunes in trade at Southampton ? Oh ! I ’m glad we do n’t visit them . I do n’t like shoppy people . I think we are far better off , knowing only cottagers and labourers , and people without pretence . ”
7138	7150	7152	7153	her mother	469	“ You must not be so fastidious , Margaret , dear ! ”
7174	7238	7158	7172	a young and handsome Mr. Gormon whom she had once met at Mr. Hume ’s	671	“ No ! I call mine a very comprehensive taste ; I like all people whose occupations have to do with land ; I like soldiers and sailors , and the three learned professions , as they call them . I ’m sure you do n’t want me to admire butchers and bakers , and candlestick - makers , do you , mamma ? ”
7239	7256	7152	7153	her mother	469	“ But the Gormons were neither butchers nor bakers , but very respectable coach - builders . ”
7257	7312	7158	7172	a young and handsome Mr. Gormon whom she had once met at Mr. Hume ’s	671	“ Very well . Coach - building is a trade all the same , and I think a much more useless one than that of butchers or bakers . Oh ! how tired I used to be of the drives every day in Aunt Shaw ’s carriage , and how I longed to walk ! ”
8013	8017	7996	7996	Frederick	146	“ Poor Frederick . ”
8744	8749	8727	8727	Sarah	160	“ Mr. Henry Lennox . ”
8753	8761	8727	8727	Sarah	160	“ THE MORE HASTE THE WORSE SPEED . ”
8762	8819	8820	8822	MRS . BROWNING	162	“ Learn to win a lady ’s faith Nobly , as the thing is high ; Bravely , as for life and death — With a loyal gravity . Lead her from the festive boards , Point her to the starry skies , Guard her , by your truthful words , Pure from courtship ’s flatteries . ”
8824	8829	8835	8835	him	732	“ Mr. Henry Lennox . ”
8854	8864	8843	8843	his	732	“ parler du soleil et l’on en voit les rayons ”
8893	8899	8901	8901	she	123	“ Tell mamma , Sarah , ”
8903	8927	8901	8901	she	123	“ Mamma and I want to ask you so many questions about Edith ; I am so much obliged to you for coming . ”
8928	8937	8939	8939	he	732	“ Did not I say that I should ? ”
8953	8974	8939	8939	he	732	“ But I heard of you so far away in the Highlands that I never thought Hampshire could come in . ”
8975	8978	8980	8980	he	732	“ Oh ! ”
8985	9090	8980	8980	he	732	“ our young couple were playing such foolish pranks , running all sorts of risks , climbing this mountain , sailing on that lake , that I really thought they needed a Mentor to take care of them . And indeed they did : they were quite beyond my uncle ’s management , and kept the old gentleman in a panic for sixteen hours out of the twenty - four . Indeed , when I once saw how unfit they were to be trusted alone , I thought it my duty not to leave them till I had seen them safely embarked at Plymouth . ”
9091	9125	8980	8980	he	732	“ Have you been at Plymouth ? Oh ! Edith never named that . To be sure , she has written in such a hurry lately . Did they really sail on Tuesday ? ”
9126	9163	8980	8980	he	732	“ Really sailed , and relieved me from many responsibilities . Edith gave me all sorts of messages for you . I believe I have a little diminutive note somewhere ; yes , here it is . ”
9164	9170	9172	9172	Margaret	123	“ Oh ! thank you , ”
9409	9433	9401	9401	He	135	“ The living is evidently as small as she said . It seems strange , for the Beresfords belong to a good family . ”
9483	9656	9657	9657	Margaret	123	“ It is most unfortunate ! We are dining early to - day , and having nothing but cold meat , in order that the servants may get on with their ironing ; and yet , of course , we must ask him to dinner — Edith ’s brother - in - law and all . And your papa is in such low spirits this morning about something — I do n’t know what . I went into the study just now , and he had his face on the table , covering it with his hands . I told him I was sure Helstone air did not agree with him any more than with me , and he suddenly lifted up his head , and begged me not to speak a word more against Helstone , he could not bear it ; if there was one place he loved on earth it was Helstone . But I am sure , for all that , it is the damp and relaxing air . ”
9706	9767	9703	9704	Mr. Lennox	135	“ Papa likes Mr. Lennox ; they got on together famously at the wedding breakfast . I daresay his coming will do papa good . And never mind the dinner , dear mamma . Cold meat will do capitally for a lunch , which is the light in which Mr. Lennox will most likely look upon a two o’clock dinner . ”
9768	9789	9862	9862	she	142	“ But what are we to do with him till then ? It is only half - past ten now . ”
9790	9836	9837	9838	Mrs. Hale	142	“ I ’ll ask him to go out sketching with me . I know he draws , and that will take him out of your way , mamma . Only do come in now ; he will think it so strange if you do n’t . ”
9984	9998	10000	10000	Margaret	123	“ Now , please , just stop here for a minute or two , ”
10002	10024	10000	10000	Margaret	123	“ These are the cottages that haunted me so during the rainy fortnight , reproaching me for not having sketched them . ”
10025	10068	9952	9952	her	123	“ Before they tumbled down and were no more seen . Truly , if they are to be sketched — and they are very picturesque — we had better not put it off till next year . But where shall we sit ? ”
10069	10133	10000	10000	Margaret	123	“ Oh ! You might have come straight from chambers in the Temple , instead of having been two months in the Highlands ! Look at this beautiful trunk of a tree , which the woodcutters have left just in the right place for the light . I will put my plaid over it , and it will be a regular forest throne . ”
10134	10167	9952	9952	her	123	“ With your feet in that puddle for a regal footstool ! Stay , I will move , and then you can come nearer this way . Who lives in these cottages ? ”
10168	10230	10231	10233	The old man	748	“ They were built by squatters fifty or sixty years ago . One is uninhabited ; the foresters are going to take it down , as soon as the other is dead , poor old fellow ! Look — there he is — I must go and speak to him . He is so deaf you will hear all our secrets . ”
10331	10339	10341	10341	she	123	“ Now , I call that treacherous , ”
10343	10371	10341	10341	she	123	“ I little thought that you were making old Isaac and me into subjects , when you told me to ask him the history of these cottages . ”
10372	10401	10402	10402	He	135	“ It was irresistible . You ca n’t know how strong a temptation it was . I hardly dare tell you how much I shall like this sketch . ”
10614	10632	10634	10634	he	134	“ I think you have made the tints on the thatch too dark , have you not ? ”
10662	10698	10700	10700	she	123	“ No , papa ! I do n’t think I have . The house - leek and stone - crop have grown so much darker in the rain . Is it not like , papa ? ”
10719	10771	10700	10700	she	123	“ Yes , very like . Your figure and way of holding yourself is capital . And it is just poor old Isaac ’s stiff way of stooping his long rheumatic back . What is this hanging from the branch of the tree ? Not a bird ’s nest , surely . ”
10772	10819	10841	10842	Mr. Lennox	135	“ Oh no ! that is my bonnet . I never can draw with my bonnet on ; it makes my head so hot . I wonder if I could manage figures . There are so many people about here whom I should like to sketch . ”
10820	10839	10841	10842	Mr. Lennox	135	“ I should say that a likeness you very much wish to take you would always succeed in , ”
10844	10866	10841	10842	Mr. Lennox	135	“ I have great faith in the power of will . I think myself I have succeeded pretty well in yours . ”
10895	10909	10911	10912	Mr. Lennox	135	“ A regular London girl would understand the implied meaning of that speech , ”
10914	10948	10950	10950	he	135	“ She would be up to looking through every speech that a young man made her for the _ arrière - pensée _ of a compliment . But I do n’t believe Margaret,—Stay ! ”
10952	10957	10950	10950	he	135	“ Let me help you ”
11103	11120	11122	11123	Mr. Hale	134	“ Margaret , my child , you might have gathered us some pears for our dessert , ”
11220	11248	11339	11340	Mrs. Hale	142	“ There are a few brown beurrés against the south wall which are worth all foreign fruits and preserves . Run , Margaret , and gather some . ”
11249	11264	11266	11267	Mr. Lennox	135	“ I propose that we adjourn into the garden , and eat them there , ”
11269	11319	11320	11320	He	134	“ Nothing is so delicious as to set one ’s teeth into the crisp , juicy fruit , warm and scented by the sun . The worst is , the wasps are impudent enough to dispute it with one , even at the very crisis and summit of enjoyment . ”
11422	11431	11433	11434	Mr. Hale	134	“ I shall arm myself with a knife , ”
11436	11465	11433	11434	Mr. Hale	134	“ the days of eating fruit so primitively as you describe are over with me . I must pare it and quarter it before I can enjoy it . ”
11572	11665	11546	11547	Mr. Lennox	135	“ What a perfect life you seem to live here ! I have always felt rather contemptuously towards the poets before , with their wishes , ‘ Mine be a cot beside a hill , ’ and that sort of thing ; but now I am afraid that the truth is , I have been nothing better than a Cockney . Just now I feel as if twenty years ’ hard study of law would be amply rewarded by one year of such an exquisite serene life as this — such skies ! ”
11667	11679	11546	11547	Mr. Lennox	135	up—“such crimson and amber foliage , so perfectly motionless as that ! ”
11700	11774	11546	11547	Mr. Lennox	135	“ You must please to remember that our skies are not always as deep a blue as they are now . We have rain , and our leaves do fall , and get sodden : though I think Helstone is about as perfect a place as any in the world . Recollect how you rather scorned my description of it one evening in Harley Street : ‘ a village in a tale . ’ ”
11775	11787	11546	11547	Mr. Lennox	135	“ Scorned , Margaret ! That is rather a hard word . ”
11788	11835	11546	11547	Mr. Lennox	135	“ Perhaps it is . Only I know I should have liked to have talked to you of what I was very full at the time , and you — what must I call it then?—spoke disrespectfully of Helstone as a mere village in a tale . ”
11836	11844	11846	11846	he	776	“ I will never do so again , ”
11858	11867	11868	11868	he	776	“ I could almost wish , Margaret — — ”
12018	12021	12023	12023	he	776	“ Margaret , ”
12061	12113	12116	12116	she	123	“ Margaret , I wish you did not like Helstone so much — did not seem so perfectly calm and happy here . I have been hoping for these three months past to find you regretting London — and London friends , a little — enough to make you listen more kindly ”
12132	12178	12116	12116	she	123	“ to one who has not much to offer , it is true — nothing but prospects in the future — but who does love you , Margaret , almost in spite of himself . Margaret , have I startled you too much ? Speak ! ”
12221	12301	12218	12218	she	123	“ I was startled . I did not know that you cared for me in that way . I have always thought of you as a friend ; and , please , I would rather go on thinking of you so . I do n’t like to be spoken to as you have been doing . I can not answer you as you want me to do , and yet I should feel so sorry if I vexed you . ”
12302	12305	12307	12307	he	782	“ Margaret , ”
12336	12338	12307	12307	he	782	“ Do you”—he
12342	12347	12218	12218	she	123	say—“love any one else ? ”
12367	12405	12410	12410	He	782	“ Forgive me ! I have been too abrupt . I am punished . Only let me hope . Give me the poor comfort of telling me you have never seen any one whom you could — — ”
12428	12456	12419	12419	herself	123	“ Ah ! if you had but never got this fancy into your head ! It was such a pleasure to think of you as a friend . ”
12457	12497	12498	12498	She	123	“ But I may hope , may I not , Margaret , that some time you will think of me as a lover ? Not yet , I see — there is no hurry — but some time — — ”
12527	12571	12524	12524	she	123	“ I have never thought of — you , but as a friend . I like to think of you so ; but I am sure I could never think of you as anything else . Pray let us both forget that all this ”
12573	12576	12577	12577	she	123	“ disagreeable , ”
12587	12593	12524	12524	she	123	“ conversation has taken place . ”
12612	12676	12609	12609	he	785	“ Of course , as your feelings are so decided , and as this conversation has been so evidently unpleasant to you , it had better not be remembered . That is all very fine in theory , that plan of forgetting whatever is painful , but it will be somewhat difficult for me , at least , to carry it into execution . ”
12677	12682	12684	12684	she	123	“ You are vexed , ”
12688	12696	12684	12684	she	123	“ yet how can I help it ? ”
12734	12844	12731	12731	his	785	“ You should make allowances for the mortification , not only of a lover , Margaret , but of a man not given to romance in general — prudent , worldly , as some people call me — who has been carried out of his usual habits by the force of a passion — well , we will say no more of that ; but in the one outlet which he has formed for the deeper and better feelings of his nature , he meets with rejection and repulse . I shall have to console myself with scorning my own folly . A struggling barrister to think of matrimony ! ”
13161	13173	13175	13175	he	134	“ I am not so indifferent to her as she believes , ”
13179	13187	13175	13175	he	134	“ I do not give up hope . ”
13346	13418	13336	13337	Henry Lennox	135	“ Margaret , do n’t despise me ; I have a heart , notwithstanding all this good - for - nothing way of talking . As a proof of it , I believe I love you more than ever — if I do not hate you — for the disdain with which you have listened to me during this last half - hour . Good - bye , Margaret — Margaret ! ”
13426	13462	13463	13463	HABINGTON	170	“ Cast me upon some naked shore , Where I may tracke Only the print of some sad wracke , If thou be there though the seas roare , I shall no gentler calm implore . ”
14005	14008	14010	14011	Mr. Hale	134	“ Margaret ! ”
14029	14065	14010	14011	Mr. Hale	134	“ Is that tapestry thing of immediate consequence ? I mean , can you leave it and come into my study ? I want to speak to you about something very serious to us all . ”
14066	14073	14074	14075	Mr. Lennox	135	“ Very serious to us all . ”
14234	14243	14217	14217	he	444	all—“Margaret ! I am going to leave Helstone . ”
14244	14253	14217	14217	he	444	“ Leave Helstone , papa ! But why ? ”
14323	14334	14335	14335	He	444	“ But why , dear papa ? Do tell me ! ”
14352	14367	14335	14335	He	444	“ Because I must no longer be a minister in the Church of England . ”
14559	14602	14543	14544	her father	444	“ Oh ! what is it ? do speak , papa ! tell me all ! Why can you no longer be a clergyman ? Surely , if the bishop were told all we know about Frederick , and the hard unjust — ”
14603	14685	14739	14739	He	832	“ It is nothing about Frederick ; the bishop would have nothing to do with that . It is all myself . Margaret , I will tell you about it . I will answer any questions this once , but after to - night let us never speak of it again . I can meet the consequences of my painful , miserable doubts ; but it is an effort beyond me to speak of what has caused me so much suffering . ”
14686	14696	14698	14698	Margaret	123	“ Doubts , papa ! Doubts as to religion ? ”
14705	14721	14722	14722	He	832	“ No ! not doubts as to religion ; not the slightest injury to that . ”
14755	14820	14739	14739	He	832	“ You could not understand it all , if I told you — my anxiety , for years past , to know whether I had any right to hold my living — my efforts to quench my smouldering doubts by the authority of the Church . Oh ! Margaret , how I love the holy Church from which I am to be shut out ! ”
14857	14874	14875	14876	Mr. Hale	134	“ I have been reading to - day of the two thousand who were ejected from their churches,”—continued
14879	14905	14875	14876	Mr. Hale	134	faintly,—“trying to steal some of their bravery ; but it is of no use — no use — I can not help feeling it acutely . ”
14906	14926	14928	14928	Margaret	123	“ But , papa , have you well considered ? Oh ! it seems so terrible , so shocking , ”
15043	15049	15051	15051	he	134	“ Listen , dear Margaret , ”
15097	15152	15157	15157	he	134	“ This is the soliloquy of one who was once a clergyman in a country parish , like me ; it was written by Mr. Oldfield , minister of Carsington , in Derbyshire , a hundred and sixty years ago , or more . His trials are over . He fought the good fight . ”
15172	15445	15167	15167	he	134	“ When thou canst no longer continue in thy work without dishonour to God , discredit to religion , foregoing thy integrity , wounding conscience , spoiling thy peace , and hazarding the loss of thy salvation ; in a word , when the conditions upon which thou must continue ( if thou wilt continue ) in thy employments are sinful , and unwarranted by the word of God , thou mayest , yea , thou must believe that God will turn thy very silence , suspension , deprivation , and laying aside , to His glory , and the advancement of the Gospel ’s interest . When God will not use thee in one kind , yet He will in another . A soul that desires to serve and honour Him shall never want opportunity to do it ; nor must thou so limit the Holy One of Israel , as to think He hath but one way in which He can glorify Himself by thee . He can do it by thy silence as well as by thy preaching ; the laying aside as well as thy continuance in thy work . It is not pretence of doing God the greatest service , or performing the weightiest duty , that will excuse the least sin , though that sin capacitated or gave us the opportunity for doing that duty . Thou wilt have little thanks , O my soul ! if , when thou art charged with corrupting God ’s worship , falsifying thy vows , thou pretendest a necessity for it in order to a continuance in the ministry . ”
15512	15517	15519	15519	he	837	“ Margaret , dear ! ”
15525	15540	15519	15519	he	837	“ think of the early martyrs ; think of the thousands who have suffered . ”
15541	15546	15548	15548	she	123	“ But , father , ”
15561	15580	15548	15548	she	123	“ the early martyrs suffered for the truth , while you — oh ! dear , dear papa ! ”
15581	15592	15594	15594	he	837	“ I suffer for conscience ’ sake , my child , ”
15611	15641	15642	15642	He	837	“ I must do what my conscience bids . I have borne long with self - reproach that would have roused any mind less torpid and cowardly than mine . ”
15651	15779	15644	15644	his	837	“ Your poor mother ’s fond wish , gratified at last in the mocking way in which over - fond wishes are too often fulfilled — Sodom apples as they are — has brought on this crisis , for which I ought to be , and I hope I am thankful . It is not a month since the bishop offered me another living ; if I had accepted it , I should have had to make a fresh declaration of conformity to the Liturgy at my institution . Margaret , I tried to do it ; I tried to content myself with simply refusing the additional preferment , and stopping quietly here,—strangling my conscience now , as I had strained it before . God forgive me ! ”
15815	15831	15812	15812	he	837	“ Margaret , I return to the old sad burden : we must leave Helstone . ”
15832	15841	15647	15647	he	837	“ Yes ! I see . But when ? ”
15842	15866	15868	15869	Mr. Hale	134	“ I have written to the bishop — I dare say I have told you so , but I forget things just now , ”
15892	16011	15879	15879	he	837	“ informing him of my intention to resign this vicarage . He has been most kind ; he has used arguments and expostulations , all in vain — in vain . They are but what I have tried upon myself , without avail . I shall have to take my deed of resignation , and wait upon the bishop myself , to bid him farewell . That will be a trial . But worse , far worse , will be the parting from my dear people . There is a curate appointed to read prayers — a Mr. Brown . He will come to stay with us to - morrow . Next Sunday I preach my farewell sermon . ”
16067	16073	16075	16075	she	123	“ What does mamma say ? ”
16104	16179	16181	16181	he	444	“ Margaret , I am a poor coward after all . I can not bear to give pain . I know so well your mother ’s married life has not been all she hoped — all she had a right to expect — and this will be such a blow to her , that I have never had the heart , the power to tell her . She must be told though , now , ”
16214	16221	16223	16223	Margaret	123	“ Yes , indeed she must , ”
16225	16244	16223	16223	Margaret	123	“ Perhaps , after all , she may not — Oh yes ! she will , she must be shocked”—as
16263	16271	16273	16273	she	123	“ Where are we to go to ? ”
16295	16301	16302	16302	he	444	“ To Milton - Northern , ”
16355	16366	16372	16372	he	444	“ Milton - Northern ! The manufacturing town in Darkshire ? ”
16367	16370	16372	16372	he	444	“ Yes , ”
16382	16388	16390	16390	she	123	“ Why there , papa ? ”
16392	16425	16390	16390	she	123	“ Because there I can earn bread for my family . Because I know no one there , and no one knows Helstone , or can ever talk to me about it . ”
16426	16437	16439	16439	she	123	“ Bread for your family ! I thought you and mamma had”—and
16498	16587	16464	16464	he	444	“ You shall be told all , Margaret . Only help me to tell your mother . I think I could do anything but that : the idea of her distress turns me sick with dread . If I tell you all , perhaps you could break it to her to - morrow . I am going out for the day , to bid farmer Dobson and the poor people on Bracy Common good - bye . Would you dislike breaking it to her very much , Margaret ? ”
16625	16637	16621	16622	Her father	444	“ You dislike it very much do n’t you , Margaret ? ”
16655	16689	16639	16639	she	123	“ It is a painful thing , but it must be done , and I will do it as well as ever I can . You must have many painful things to do . ”
16725	16763	16722	16722	she	123	“ Now tell me , papa , what our plans are . You and mamma have some money , independent of the income from the living , have you not ? Aunt Shaw has , I know . ”
16764	16808	16809	16809	he	134	“ Yes . I suppose we have about a hundred and twenty pounds a year of our own . Seventy of that has always gone to Frederick , since he has been abroad . I do n’t know if he wants it all , ”
16816	16829	16809	16809	he	134	“ He must have some pay for serving with the Spanish army . ”
16830	16836	16838	16838	Margaret	123	“ Frederick must not suffer , ”
16842	16893	16838	16838	Margaret	123	“ in a foreign country ; so unjustly treated by his own . A hundred is left . Could not you , and I , and mamma live on a hundred a year in some very cheap — very quiet part of England ? Oh ! I think we could . ”
16894	16897	16899	16900	Mr. Hale	134	“ No ! ”
16902	17022	17024	17024	he	134	“ That would not answer . I must do something ! I must make myself busy , to keep off morbid thoughts . Besides , in a country parish I should be so painfully reminded of Helstone , and my duties here . I could not bear it , Margaret . And a hundred a year would go a very little way , after the necessary wants of housekeeping are met , towards providing your mother with all the comforts she has been accustomed to , and ought to have . No : we must go to Milton . That is settled . I can always decide better by myself , and not influenced by those whom I love , ”
17048	17061	17062	17062	Margaret	123	“ I can not stand objections . They make me so undecided . ”
17090	17123	17086	17087	Mr. Hale	134	“ A few months ago , when my misery of doubt became more than I could bear without speaking , I wrote to Mr. Bell — you remember Mr. Bell , Margaret ? ”
17124	17157	17086	17087	Mr. Hale	134	“ No ; I never saw him , I think . But I know who he is . Frederick ’s godfather — your old tutor at Oxford , do n’t you mean ? ”
17158	17284	17086	17087	Mr. Hale	134	“ Yes . He is a Fellow of Plymouth College there . He is a native of Milton - Northern , I believe . At any rate he has property there , which has very much increased in value since Milton has become such a large manufacturing town . Well ; I had reason to suspect — to imagine — I had better say nothing about it , however . But I felt sure of sympathy from Mr. Bell . I do n’t know that he gave me much strength . He has lived an easy life in his college all his days . But he has been as kind as can be . And it is owing to him we are going to Milton . ”
17285	17288	17290	17290	Margaret	123	“ How ? ”
17292	17350	17290	17290	Margaret	123	“ Why he has tenants , and houses , and mills there ; so , though he dislikes the place — too bustling for one of his habits — he is obliged to keep up some sort of connection ; and he tells me that he hears there is a good opening for a private tutor there . ”
17351	17356	17358	17358	Margaret	123	“ A private tutor ! ”
17363	17385	17358	17358	Margaret	123	“ What in the world do manufacturers want with the classics , or literature , or the accomplishments of a gentleman ? ”
17386	17389	17391	17392	her father	444	“ Oh , ”
17394	17535	17391	17392	her father	444	“ some of them really seem to be fine fellows , conscious of their own deficiencies , which is more than many a man at Oxford is . Some want resolutely to learn , though they have come to man ’s estate . Some want their children to be better instructed than they themselves have been . At any rate , there is an opening , as I have said , for a private tutor . Mr. Bell has recommended me to a Mr. Thornton , a tenant of his , and a very intelligent man , as far as I can judge from his letters . And in Milton , Margaret , I shall find a busy life , if not a happy one , and people and scenes so different that I shall never be reminded of Helstone . ”
17611	17617	17619	17619	Margaret	123	“ When do we go ? ”
17626	17676	17619	17619	Margaret	123	“ I do not know exactly . I wanted to talk it over with you . You see , your mother knows nothing about it yet : but I think , in a fortnight;—after my deed of resignation is sent in , I shall have no right to remain . ”
17682	17687	17619	17619	Margaret	123	“ In a fortnight ! ”
17688	17703	17713	17713	he	444	“ No — no , not exactly to a day . Nothing is fixed , ”
17738	17773	17735	17735	herself	123	“ Yes , papa , it had better be fixed soon and decidedly , as you say . Only mamma to know nothing about it ! It is that that is the great perplexity . ”
17774	17778	17780	17781	Mr. Hale	134	“ Poor Maria ! ”
17784	17825	17780	17781	Mr. Hale	134	“ Poor , poor Maria ! Oh , if I were not married — if I were but myself in the world , how easy it would be ! As it is — Margaret , I dare not tell her ! ”
17826	17829	17831	17831	Margaret	123	“ No , ”
17835	17857	17859	17859	she	123	“ I will do it . Give me till to - morrow evening to choose my time . Oh , papa , ”
17865	17931	17859	17859	she	123	“ say — tell me it is a nightmare — a horrid dream — not the real waking truth ! You can not mean that you are really going to leave the Church — to give up Helstone — to be for ever separate from me , from mamma — led away by some delusion — some temptation ! You do not really mean it ! ”
17959	17985	17943	17943	he	134	way—“I do mean it , Margaret . You must not deceive yourself in doubting the reality of my words — my fixed intention and resolve . ”
18091	18103	18086	18086	he	134	“ The blessing of God be upon thee , my child ! ”
18104	18114	18116	18116	she	123	“ And may He restore you to His Church , ”
18179	18196	18174	18174	him	134	“ The martyrs and confessors had even more pain to bear — I will not shrink . ”
18228	18253	18223	18224	Mr. Hale	134	“ Go , Margaret , go . I shall be out all to - morrow . Before night you will have told your mother . ”
18254	18257	18258	18258	she	123	“ Yes , ”
18280	18321	18326	18328	a good listener	863	“ I ask Thee for a thoughtful love , Through constant watching wise , To meet the glad with joyful smiles , And to wipe the weeping eyes ; And a heart at leisure from itself To soothe and sympathise . ”
18483	18527	18542	18542	Margaret	123	“ Papa has always spent the income he derived from his living in the parish . I am , perhaps , encroaching upon the next dues , but the winter is likely to be severe , and our poor people must be helped . ”
18528	18540	18542	18542	Margaret	123	“ Oh , mamma , let us do all we can , ”
18570	18578	18542	18542	Margaret	123	“ we may not be here long . ”
18579	18588	18590	18591	Mrs. Hale	142	“ Do you feel ill , my darling ? ”
18608	18625	18590	18591	Mrs. Hale	142	“ You look pale and tired . It is this soft , damp , unhealthy air . ”
18626	18671	18542	18542	Margaret	123	“ No — no , mamma , it is not that : it is delicious air . It smells of the freshest , purest fragrance , after the smokiness of Harley Street . But I am tired : it surely must be near bedtime . ”
18672	18734	18590	18591	Mrs. Hale	142	“ Not far off — it is half - past nine . You had better go to bed at once , dear . Ask Dixon for some gruel . I will come and see you as soon as you are in bed . I am afraid you have taken cold ; or the bad air from some of the stagnant ponds — ”
18735	18740	18742	18742	Margaret	123	“ Oh , mamma , ”
18752	18769	18742	18742	Margaret	123	“ I am quite well — don’t alarm yourself about me ; I am only tired . ”
19231	19270	19214	19214	He	444	“ Margaret , I heard you were up . I could not help coming in to ask you to pray with me — to say the Lord ’s Prayer ; that will do good to both of us . ”
19668	19705	19654	19654	he	134	“ I shall not be home till evening . I am going to Bracy Common , and will ask Farmer Dobson to give me something for dinner . I shall be back to tea at seven . ”
19833	19849	19851	19851	Margaret	123	“ Mother , come round the garden with me this morning ; just one turn , ”
19917	19927	19928	19928	she	142	“ Mamma ! Papa is going to leave Helstone ! ”
19932	19948	19928	19928	she	142	“ He ’s going to leave the Church , and live in Milton - Northern . ”
19958	19965	19967	19968	Mrs. Hale	142	“ What makes you say so ? ”
19977	19986	19967	19968	Mrs. Hale	142	“ Who has been telling you such nonsense ? ”
19987	19991	19993	19993	Margaret	123	“ Papa himself , ”
20027	20034	20035	20035	she	142	“ I do n’t understand you , ”
20038	20055	20035	20035	she	142	“ Either you have made some great mistake , or I do n’t quite understand you . ”
20056	20132	20133	20134	Mrs. Hale	142	“ No , mother , I have made no mistake . Papa has written to the bishop , saying that he has such doubts that he can not conscientiously remain a priest of the Church of England , and that he must give up Helstone . He has also consulted Mr. Bell — Frederick ’s godfather , you know , mamma ; and it is arranged that we go to live at Milton - Northern . ”
20171	20181	20183	20184	Mrs. Hale	142	“ I do n’t think it can be true , ”
20189	20202	20183	20184	Mrs. Hale	142	“ He would surely have told me before it came to this . ”
20291	20330	20280	20280	her	123	“ Dear , darling mamma ! we were so afraid of giving you pain . Papa felt so acutely — you know you are not strong , and there must have been such terrible suspense to go through . ”
20331	20340	20379	20380	Mrs. Hale	142	“ When did he tell you , Margaret ? ”
20341	20347	20349	20349	Margaret	123	“ Yesterday , only yesterday , ”
20359	20361	20349	20349	Margaret	123	“ Poor papa!”—trying
20385	20394	20395	20395	she	142	“ What does he mean by having doubts ? ”
20398	20418	20382	20382	her	142	“ Surely , he does not mean that he thinks differently — that he knows better than the Church . ”
20444	20453	20455	20456	Mrs. Hale	142	“ Ca n’t the bishop set him right ? ”
20460	20466	20468	20468	Margaret	123	“ I ’m afraid not , ”
20470	20524	20468	20468	Margaret	123	“ But I did not ask . I could not bear to hear what he might answer . It is all settled at any rate . He is going to leave Helstone in a fortnight . I am not sure if he did not say he had sent in his deed of resignation . ”
20525	20530	20532	20533	Mrs. Hale	142	“ In a fortnight ! ”
20535	20555	20557	20557	she	142	“ I do think this is very strange — not at all right . I call it very unfeeling , ”
20566	20608	20557	20557	she	142	“ He has doubts you say , and gives up his living , and all without consulting me . I dare say , if he had told me his doubts at the first I could have nipped them in the bud . ”
20657	20671	20673	20673	she	123	“ I almost hoped you might be glad to leave Helstone , mamma , ”
20679	20692	20673	20673	she	123	“ You have never been well in this air , you know . ”
20693	20839	20840	20840	Margaret	123	“ You ca n’t think the smoky air of a manufacturing town , all chimneys and dirt like Milton - Northern , would be better than this air , which is pure and sweet , if it is too soft and relaxing . Fancy living in the middle of factories , and factory people ! Though , of course , if your father leaves the Church , we shall not be admitted into society anywhere . It will be such a disgrace to us ! Poor dear Sir John ! It is well he is not alive to see what your father has come to ! Every day after dinner , when I was a girl , living with your Aunt Shaw , at Beresford Court , Sir John used to give for the first toast—‘Church and King , and down with the Rump . ’ ”
20904	20952	21154	21155	Mrs. Hale	142	“ You know , we have very little society here , mamma . The Gormans , who are our nearest neighbours ( to call society — and we hardly ever see them ) , have been in trade just as much as these Milton - Northern people . ”
20953	20956	20958	20959	Mrs. Hale	142	“ Yes , ”
20964	21008	20958	20959	Mrs. Hale	142	“ but at any rate , the Gormans made carriages for half the gentlemen of the county , and were brought into some kind of intercourse with them ; but these factory people , who on earth wears cotton that can afford linen ? ”
21009	21051	21154	21155	Mrs. Hale	142	“ Well , mamma , I give up the cotton - spinners ; I am not standing up for them , any more than for any other trades - people . Only we shall have little enough to do with them . ”
21052	21068	20958	20959	Mrs. Hale	142	“ Why on earth has your father fixed on Milton - Northern to live in ? ”
21069	21072	21074	21074	Margaret	123	“ Partly , ”
21078	21103	21074	21074	Margaret	123	“ because it is so very different from Helstone — partly because Mr. Bell says there is an opening there for a private tutor . ”
21104	21125	20958	20959	Mrs. Hale	142	“ Private tutor in Milton ! Why ca n’t he go to Oxford , and be a tutor to gentlemen ? ”
21126	21153	21074	21074	Margaret	123	“ You forget , mamma ! He is leaving the Church on account of his opinions — his doubts would do him no good at Oxford . ”
21171	21203	21167	21167	she	142	“ And the furniture — How in the world are we to manage the removal ? I never removed in my life , and only a fortnight to think about it ! ”
21542	21556	21533	21533	herself	123	“ Oh ! Richard , Richard , you should have told me sooner ! ”
21744	21759	21761	21761	Margaret	123	“ Oh , Dixon ! I did not hear you come into the room ! ”
21770	21776	21778	21778	she	123	“ Is it very late ? ”
21828	21838	21840	21840	Dixon	186	“ I can hardly tell what time it is , ”
21848	22061	22062	22062	Dixon	186	“ Since your mamma told me this terrible news , when I dressed her for tea , I ’ve lost all count of time . I ’m sure I do n’t know what is to become of us all . When Charlotte told me just now you were sobbing , Miss Hale , I thought , no wonder , poor thing ! And master thinking of turning Dissenter at his time of life , when , if it is not to be said he ’s done well in the Church , he ’s not done badly after all . I had a cousin , miss , who turned Methodist preacher after he was fifty years of age , and a tailor all his life ; but then he had never been able to make a pair of trousers to fit , for as long as he had been in the trade , so it was no wonder ; but for master ! as I said to missus , ‘ What would poor Sir John have said ? he never liked your marrying Mr. Hale , but if he could have known it would have come to this , he would have sworn worse oaths than ever , if that was possible ! ’ ”
22123	22126	22127	22127	she	123	“ Dixon , ”
22160	22171	22172	22172	She	123	“ Dixon ! you forget to whom you are speaking . ”
22197	22235	22236	22236	Dixon	186	“ I am Mr. Hale ’s daughter . Go ! You have made a strange mistake , and one that I am sure your own good feeling will make you sorry for when you think about it . ”
22251	22265	22248	22248	Margaret	123	“ You may leave me , Dixon . I wish you to go . ”
22295	22323	22290	22290	she	123	“ Miss Margaret has a touch of the old gentleman about her , as well as poor Master Frederick ; I wonder where they get it from ? ”
22358	22373	22325	22325	she	123	“ May n’t I unfasten your gown , miss , and do your hair ? ”
22374	22385	22387	22387	Margaret	123	“ No ! not to - night , thank you . ”
22522	22534	22519	22519	Dixon	186	“ Anyone but a gentleman — indeed almost any other gentleman — ”
22572	22581	22549	22549	she	123	“ little tickling at my chest , miss . ”
22957	22988	22989	22989	He	444	“ My dear ! I have really had too much to think about to settle this . What does your mother say ? What does she wish ? Poor Maria ! ”
23040	23045	23018	23019	Mr. Hale	134	“ My poor mistress ! ”
23046	23057	23059	23060	Mr. Hale	134	“ You do n’t think her worse to - day , ”
23065	23098	23059	23060	Mr. Hale	134	“ I am sure I ca n’t say , sir . It ’s not for me to judge . The illness seems so much more on the mind than on the body . ”
23105	23120	23122	23122	Margaret	123	“ You had better take mamma her tea while it is hot , Dixon , ”
23131	23157	23122	23122	Margaret	123	“ Oh ! I beg your pardon , Miss ! My thoughts was otherwise occupied in thinking of my poor — — of Mrs. Hale . ”
23158	23161	23163	23163	Margaret	123	“ Papa ! ”
23165	23194	23195	23195	she	123	“ it is this suspense that is bad for you both . Of course , mamma must feel your change of opinions : we ca n’t help that , ”
23199	23276	23195	23195	she	123	“ but now the course is clear , at least to a certain point . And I think , papa , that I could get mamma to help me in planning , if you could tell me what to plan for . She has never expressed any wish in any way , and only thinks of what ca n’t be helped . Are we to go straight to Milton ? Have you taken a house there ? ”
23277	23280	23281	23281	he	972	“ No , ”
23284	23300	23281	23281	he	972	“ I suppose we must go into lodgings , and look about for a house . ”
23301	23325	23195	23195	she	123	“ And pack up the furniture so that it can be left at the railway station , till we have met with one ? ”
23326	23349	23281	23281	he	972	“ I suppose so . Do what you think best . Only remember , we shall have much less money to spend . ”
23620	23735	23606	23606	She	123	“ I have hit upon such a beautiful plan . Look here — in Darkshire , hardly the breadth of my finger from Milton , is Heston , which I have often heard of from people living in the north as such a pleasant little bathing - place . Now , do n’t you think we could get mamma there with Dixon , while you and I go and look at houses , and get one all ready for her in Milton ? She would get a breath of sea air to set her up for the winter , and be spared all the fatigue , and Dixon would enjoy taking care of her . ”
23736	23744	23746	23747	Mr. Hale	134	“ Is Dixon to go with us ? ”
23756	23761	23763	23763	Margaret	123	“ Oh , yes ! ”
23765	23783	23763	23763	Margaret	123	“ Dixon quite intends it , and I do n’t know what mamma would do without her . ”
23784	23841	23606	23606	She	123	“ But we shall have to put up with a very different way of living , I am afraid . Everything is so much dearer in a town . I doubt if Dixon can make herself comfortable . To tell you the truth , Margaret , I sometimes feel as if that woman gave herself airs . ”
23842	23851	23853	23853	Margaret	123	“ To be sure she does , papa , ”
23855	23931	23853	23853	Margaret	123	“ and if she has to put up with a different style of living , we shall have to put up with her airs , which will be worse . But she really loves us all , and would be miserable to leave us , I am sure — especially in this change ; so , for mamma ’s sake , and for the sake of her faithfulness , I do think she must go . ”
23932	23971	23606	23606	She	123	“ Very well , my dear . Go on . I am resigned . How far is Heston from Milton ? The breadth of one of your fingers does not give me a very clear idea of distance . ”
23972	23989	23606	23606	She	123	“ Well , then , I suppose it is thirty miles ; that is not much ! ”
23990	24017	23853	23853	Margaret	123	“ Not in distance , but in—. Never mind ! If you really think it will do your mother good , let it be fixed so . ”
24124	24245	24246	24246	TENNYSON	138	“ Unwatch’d the garden bough shall sway , The tender blossom flutter down , Unloved that beech will gather brown , The maple burn itself away ; Unloved , the sun - flower , shining fair , Ray round with flames her disk of seed , And many a rose - carnation feed With summer spice the humming air ; * * * * * Till from the garden and the wild A fresh association blow And year by year the landscape grow Familiar to the stranger ’s child ; As year by year the labourer tills His wonted glebe , or lops the glades ; And year by year our memory fades From all the circle of the hills . ”
25378	25394	25353	25353	Margaret	123	“ Let me in ! Let me in ! It is only me , Charlotte ! ”
25486	25499	25501	25501	she	123	“ I was afraid you were shutting me out altogether , Charlotte , ”
25507	25533	25501	25501	she	123	“ And then you would never have heard me in the kitchen , and the doors into the lane and churchyard are locked long ago . ”
25534	25585	25501	25501	she	123	“ Oh , miss , I should have been sure to have missed you soon . The men would have wanted you to tell them how to go on . And I have put tea in master ’s study , as being the most comfortable room , so to speak . ”
25586	25656	25501	25501	she	123	“ Thank you , Charlotte . You are a kind girl . I shall be sorry to leave you . You must try and write to me , if I can ever give you any little help or good advice . I shall always be glad to get a letter from Helstone , you know . I shall be sure and send you my address when I know it . ”
25846	25858	25860	25860	she	123	“ Have you been a very long walk to - day ? ”
25873	25923	25860	25860	she	123	“ As far as Fordham Beeches . I went to see Widow Maltby ; she is sadly grieved at not having wished you good - bye . She says little Susan has kept watch down the lane for days past.—Nay , Margaret , what is the matter , dear ? ”
26021	26058	26019	26019	himself	134	“ I can not bear it . I can not bear to see the sufferings of others . I think I could go through my own with patience . Oh , is there no going back ? ”
26059	26064	26066	26066	Margaret	123	“ No , father , ”
26079	26101	26102	26102	She	123	“ It is bad to believe you in error . It would be infinitely worse to have known you a hypocrite . ”
26131	26134	26135	26135	she	123	“ Besides , ”
26139	26183	26185	26185	she	123	“ it is only that I am tired to - night ; do n’t think that I am suffering from what you have done , dear papa . We ca n’t either of us talk about it to - night , I believe , ”
26199	26241	26135	26135	she	123	“ I had better go and take mamma up this cup of tea . She had hers very early , when I was too busy to go to her , and I am sure she will be glad of another now . ”
26649	26728	26618	26618	she	186	“ Oh , there ’s Harrison ’s , where I bought so many of my wedding things . Dear ! how altered ! They ’ve got immense plate - glass windows , larger than Crawford ’s in Southampton . Oh , and there , I declare — no , it is not — yes , it is — Margaret , we have just passed Mr. Henry Lennox . Where can he be going , among all these shops ? ”
26984	27016	26977	26980	the friends of Job	1089	“ they sat with him on the ground seven days and seven nights , and none spake a word unto him ; for they saw that his grief was very great . ”
27025	27039	27040	27041	MATTHEW ARNOLD	194	“ Mist clogs the sunshine , Smoky dwarf houses Hem me round everywhere . ”
27120	27125	27144	27148	the people in the streets	1098	“ purpose - like . ”
27807	27809	27801	27801	her	123	“ unparliamentary ”
27959	27963	27965	27966	Mr. Hale	134	“ New Street , ”
27968	28050	27965	27966	Mr. Hale	134	“ This , I believe , is the principal street in Milton . Bell has often spoken to me about it . It was the opening of this street from a lane into a great thoroughfare , thirty years ago , which has caused his property to rise so much in value . Mr. Thornton ’s mill must be somewhere not very far off , for he is Mr. Bell ’s tenant . But I fancy he dates from his warehouse . ”
28051	28059	27920	27920	People	617	“ Where is our hotel , papa ? ”
28060	28092	27965	27966	Mr. Hale	134	“ Close to the end of this street , I believe . Shall we have lunch before or after we have looked at the houses we marked in the Milton Times ? ”
28093	28104	27965	27966	Mr. Hale	134	“ Oh , let us get our work done first . ”
28105	28173	27920	27920	People	617	“ Very well . Then I will only see if there is any note or letter for me from Mr. Thornton , who said he would let me know anything he might hear about these houses , and then we will set off . We will keep the cab ; it will be safer than losing ourselves , and being too late for the train this afternoon . ”
28262	28463	28253	28253	They	1144	“ We must go back to the second , I think . That one,—in Crampton , do n’t they call the suburb ? There were three sitting - rooms ; do n’t you remember how we laughed at the number compared with the three bed - rooms ? But I have planned it all . The front room down - stairs is to be your study and our dining - room ( poor papa ! ) , for you know , we settled mamma is to have as cheerful a sitting - room as we can get ; and that front room up - stairs , with the atrocious blue and pink paper and heavy cornice , had really a pretty view over the plain , with a great bend of river , or canal , or whatever it is , down below . Then I could have the little bed - room behind , in that projection at the head of the first flight of stairs over the kitchen , you know — and you and mamma the room behind the drawing - room , and that closet in the roof will make you a splendid dressing - room . ”
28464	28478	28253	28253	They	1144	“ But Dixon , and the girl we are to have to help ? ”
28479	28557	28769	28770	Her father	444	“ Oh , wait a minute . I am overpowered by the discovery of my own genius for management . Dixon is to have — let me see , I had it once — the back sitting - room . I think she will like that . She grumbles so much about the stairs at Heston ; and the girl is to have that sloping attic over your room and mamma ’s . Wo n’t that do ? ”
28558	28587	28253	28253	They	1144	“ I dare say it will . But the papers . What taste ! And the over - loading such a house with colour and such heavy cornices ! ”
28588	28651	28253	28253	They	1144	“ Never mind , papa ! Surely you can charm the landlord into re - papering one or two of the rooms — the drawing - room and your bed - room — for mamma will come most in contact with them ; and your book - shelves will hide a great deal of that gaudy pattern in the dining - room . ”
28652	28726	28727	28727	Margaret	123	“ Then you think it the best ? If so , I had better go at once and call on this Mr. Donkin , to whom the advertisement refers me . I will take you back to the hotel , where you can order lunch , and rest , and by the time it is ready , I shall be with you . I hope I shall be able to get new papers . ”
28830	28913	28820	28820	she	123	“ I beg your pardon , ma’am . The gentleman was gone so quickly , I had no time to tell him . Mr. Thornton called almost directly after you left ; and as I understood , from what the gentleman said , you would be back in an hour , I told him so , and he came again about five minutes ago , and said he would wait for Mr. Hale . He is in your room now , ma’am . ”
28914	28931	28824	28828	a quick - stepping waiter	1159	“ Thank you . My father will return soon , and then you can tell him . ”
29169	29176	29178	29178	Margaret	123	“ Mr. Thornton , I believe ! ”
29197	29255	29178	29178	Margaret	123	“ Will you sit down . My father brought me to the door not a minute ago , but unfortunately he was not told that you were here , and he has gone away on some business . But he will come back almost directly . I am sorry you have had the trouble of calling twice . ”
29313	29336	29304	29304	he	179	“ Do you know where it is that Mr. Hale has gone to ? Perhaps I might be able to find him . ”
29337	29364	29365	29366	Mr. Thornton	179	“ He has gone to a Mr. Donkin in Canute Street . He is the landlord of the house my father wishes to take in Crampton . ”
30016	30039	30008	30008	he	444	“ Margaret ! the landlord will persist in admiring that hideous paper , and I am afraid we must let it remain . ”
30040	30048	30049	30049	she	123	“ Oh dear ! I am sorry ! ”
30202	30221	30168	30168	She	123	“ Well , Margaret , now to luncheon as fast as we can . Have you ordered it ? ”
30222	30244	30168	30168	She	123	“ No , papa ; that man was here when I came home , and I have never had an opportunity . ”
30245	30267	30168	30168	She	123	“ Then we must take anything we can get . He must have been waiting a long time I ’m afraid . ”
30268	30305	30168	30168	She	123	“ It seemed exceedingly long to me . I was just at the last gasp when you came in . He never went on with any subject , but gave little , short , abrupt answers . ”
30306	30354	30168	30168	She	123	“ Very much to the point though , I should think . He is a clear - headed fellow . He said ( did you hear ? ) that Crampton is on gravelly soil , and by far the most healthy suburb in the neighbourhood of Milton . ”
30391	30403	30371	30372	Mrs. Hale	142	“ And what is your correspondent , Mr. Thornton , like ? ”
30404	30408	30410	30411	her husband	594	“ Ask Margaret , ”
30413	30433	30410	30411	her husband	594	“ She and he had a long attempt at conversation , while I was away speaking to the landlord . ”
30434	30445	30447	30447	Margaret	123	“ Oh ! I hardly know what he is like , ”
30469	30487	30466	30466	she	123	“ He is a tall , broad - shouldered man , about — how old , papa ? ”
30488	30495	30410	30411	her husband	594	“ I should guess about thirty . ”
30496	30529	30466	30466	she	123	“ About thirty — with a face that is neither exactly plain , nor yet handsome , nothing remarkable — not quite a gentleman ; but that was hardly to be expected . ”
30530	30537	30466	30466	she	123	“ Not vulgar or common though , ”
30557	30562	30564	30564	Margaret	123	“ Oh , no ! ”
30566	30630	30564	30564	Margaret	123	“ With such an expression of resolution and power , no face , however plain in feature , could be either vulgar or common . I should not like to have to bargain with him ; he looks very inflexible . Altogether a man who seems made for his niche , mamma ; sagacious , and strong , as becomes a great tradesman . ”
30631	30642	30644	30645	her father	444	“ Do n’t call the Milton manufacturers tradesmen , Margaret , ”
30647	30653	30644	30645	her father	444	“ They are very different . ”
30654	30729	30564	30564	Margaret	123	“ Are they ? I apply the word to all who have something tangible to sell ; but if you think the term is not correct , papa , I wo n’t use it . But , oh mamma ! speaking of vulgarity and commonness , you must prepare yourself for our drawing - room paper . Pink and blue roses , with yellow leaves ! And such a heavy cornice round the room ! ”
30830	30846	30787	30787	he	5522	“ And it ’s hame , hame , hame , Hame fain wad I be . ”
30966	30977	30979	30980	Mrs. Hale	142	“ Oh , Margaret ! are we to live here ? ”
31010	31022	31001	31001	She	123	“ Oh , the fogs in London are sometimes far worse ! ”
31023	31055	30979	30980	Mrs. Hale	142	“ But then you knew that London itself , and friends lay behind it . Here — well ! we are desolate . Oh Dixon , what a place this is ! ”
31056	31093	30979	30980	Mrs. Hale	142	“ Indeed , ma’am , I ’m sure it will be your death before long , and then I know who’ll — stay ! Miss Hale , that ’s far too heavy for you to lift . ”
31094	31104	31106	31106	Margaret	123	“ Not at all , thank you , Dixon , ”
31109	31143	31106	31106	Margaret	123	“ The best thing we can do for mamma is to get her room quite ready for her to go to bed , while I go and bring her a cup of coffee . ”
31160	31201	31203	31203	he	134	“ Margaret , I do believe this is an unhealthy place . Only suppose that your mother ’s health or yours should suffer . I wish I had gone into some country place in Wales ; this is really terrible , ”
34154	34168	34148	34151	one of the lingerers	1332	“ Your bonny face , my lass , makes the day look brighter . ”
34199	34220	34187	34195	a poorly - dressed , middle - aged workman	1334	“ You may well smile , my lass ; many a one would smile to have such a bonny face . ”
34483	34521	34465	34465	Her	123	“ Thank yo , Miss. Bessy’ll think a deal o ’ them flowers ; that hoo will ; and I shall think a deal o ’ yor kindness . Yo’re not of this country , I reckon ? ”
34522	34525	34527	34527	Margaret	123	“ No ! ”
34532	34542	34543	34543	she	123	“ I come from the South — from Hampshire , ”
34567	34615	34543	34543	she	123	“ That ’s beyond London , I reckon ? And I come fro ’ Burnleyways , and forty miles to th ’ North . And yet , yo see , North and South has both met and made kind o ’ friends in this big smoky place . ”
34678	34688	34665	34665	she	123	“ I ’m afraid you are not very strong . ”
34689	34692	34694	34695	the girl	5516	“ No , ”
34697	34703	34694	34695	the girl	5516	“ nor never will be . ”
34704	34709	34711	34711	Margaret	123	“ Spring is coming , ”
34722	34731	34733	34734	the girl	5516	“ Spring nor summer will do me good , ”
34771	34792	34768	34768	he	1353	“ I ’m afeared hoo speaks the truth . I ’m afeared hoo ’s too far gone in a waste . ”
34793	34817	34768	34768	he	1353	“ I shall have a spring where I am boun ’ to , and flowers , and amaranths , and shining robes besides . ”
34818	34825	34827	34828	her father	444	“ Poor lass , poor lass ! ”
34834	34866	34827	34828	her father	444	“ I ’m none so sure o ’ that ; but it ’s a comfort to thee , poor lass , poor lass . Poor father ! it ’ll be soon . ”
34884	34905	34871	34871	his	1353	“ Where do you live ? I think we must be neighbours , we meet so often on this road . ”
34906	34930	34827	34828	her father	444	“ We put up at nine Frances Street , second turn to th ’ left at after yo’ve past th ’ Goulden Dragon . ”
34931	34942	34871	34871	his	1353	“ And your name ? I must not forget that . ”
34943	34970	34871	34871	his	1353	“ I ’m none ashamed o ’ my name . It ’s Nicholas Higgins . Hoo ’s called Bessy Higgins . Whatten yo ’ asking for ? ”
35017	35029	35030	35030	She	123	“ I thought — I meant to come and see you . ”
35088	35102	35077	35077	she	123	“ I ’m none so fond of having strange folk in my house . ”
35117	35154	35114	35114	he	1353	“ Yo’re a foreigner , as one may say , and maybe do n’t know many folk here , and yo’ve given my wench here flowers out of yo’r own hand;—yo may come if yo like . ”
35205	35216	35196	35197	the girl	5516	“ Yo’ll not forget yo’re to come and see us . ”
35217	35222	35224	35225	the father	1357	“ Aye , aye , ”
35229	35285	35224	35225	the father	1357	“ hoo’ll come . Hoo ’s a bit set up now , because hoo thinks I might ha ’ spoken more civilly ; but hoo’ll think better on it , and come . I can read her proud bonny face like a book . Come along , Bess ; there ’s the mill bell ringing . ”
35370	35407	35408	35410	MRS . BARBOULD	209	“ Let China ’s earth , enriched with coloured stains , Pencil’d with gold , and streaked with azure veins , The grateful flavour of the Indian leaf , Or Mocha ’s sunburnt berry glad receive . ”
35483	35500	35501	35502	Mrs. Hale	142	“ My dear ! I ’ve asked Mr. Thornton to come to tea to - night . ”
35547	35601	35534	35534	she	142	“ Mr. Thornton!—and to - night ! What in the world does the man want to come here for ? And Dixon is washing my muslins and laces , and there is no soft water with these horrid east winds , which I suppose we shall have all the year round in Milton . ”
35602	35612	35614	35615	Mr. Hale	134	“ The wind is veering round , my dear , ”
35652	35658	35660	35661	Mrs. Hale	142	“ Do n’t tell me ! ”
35676	35690	35668	35668	her	142	“ But , east or west wind , I suppose this man comes . ”
35691	35821	35660	35661	Mrs. Hale	142	“ Oh mamma , that shows you never saw Mr. Thornton . He looks like a person who would enjoy battling with every adverse thing he could meet with — enemies , winds , or circumstances . The more it rains and blows , the more certain we are to have him . But I ’ll go and help Dixon . I ’m getting to be a famous clear - starcher . And he wo n’t want any amusement beyond talking to Papa . Papa , I am really longing to see the Pythias to your Damon . You know I never saw him but once , and then we were so puzzled to know what to say to each other that we did not get on particularly well . ”
35822	35849	35850	35850	Margaret	123	“ I do n’t know that you would ever like him , or think him agreeable , Margaret . He is not a lady ’s man . ”
35859	35886	35852	35852	her	123	“ I do n’t particularly admire ladies ’ men , papa . But Mr. Thornton comes here as your friend — as one who has appreciated you ”
35888	35895	35897	35898	Mrs. Hale	142	“ The only person in Milton , ”
35900	35939	35897	35898	Mrs. Hale	142	“ So we will give him a welcome , and some cocoa - nut cakes . Dixon will be flattered if we ask her to make some ; and I will undertake to iron your caps , mamma . ”
36122	36192	36114	36114	she	123	“ Yes ! if any one had told me , when I was Miss Beresford , and one of the belles of the country , that a child of mine would have to stand half a day , in a little poky kitchen , working away like any servant , that we might prepare properly for the reception of a tradesman , and that this tradesman should be the only ”
36194	36199	36201	36201	Margaret	123	“ Oh , mamma ! ”
36207	36320	36201	36201	Margaret	123	“ do n’t punish me for so careless a speech . I do n’t mind ironing , or any kind of work for you and papa . I am myself a born and bred lady through it all , even though it comes to scouring a floor , or washing dishes . I am tired now , just for a little while ; but in half an hour I shall be ready to do the same over again . And as to Mr. Thornton ’s being in trade , why he ca n’t help that now , poor fellow . I do n’t suppose his education would fit him for much else . ”
36689	36696	36697	36697	Her	216	“ John ! Is that you ? ”
36707	36735	36705	36705	himself	1400	“ What has brought you home so early ? I thought you were going to tea with that friend of Mr. Bell ’s ; that Mr. Hale ? ”
36736	36750	36675	36675	her	216	“ So I am , mother . I am come home to dress ! ”
36751	36790	36675	36675	her	216	“ Dress ! humph ! When I was a girl , young men were satisfied with dressing once in a day . Why should you dress to go and take a cup of tea with an old parson ? ”
36791	36806	36705	36705	himself	1400	“ Mr. Hale is a gentleman , and his wife and daughter are ladies . ”
36807	36828	36675	36675	her	216	“ Wife and daughter ! Do they teach too ? What do they do ? You have never mentioned them . ”
36829	36853	36675	36675	her	216	“ No ! mother , because I have never seen Mrs. Hale ; I have only seen Miss Hale for half an hour . ”
36854	36869	36705	36705	himself	1400	“ Take care you do n’t get caught by a penniless girl , John . ”
36870	36937	36675	36675	her	216	“ I am not easily caught , mother , as I think you know . But I must not have Miss Hale spoken of in that way , which , you know , is offensive to me . I never was aware of any young lady trying to catch me yet , nor do I believe that any one has ever given themselves that useless trouble . ”
36965	37017	36953	36953	she	216	“ Well ! I only say , take care . Perhaps our Milton girls have too much spirit and good feeling to go angling after husbands ; but this Miss Hale comes out of the aristocratic counties , where , if all tales be true , rich husbands are reckoned prizes . ”
37034	37036	37025	37025	he	179	“ Mother ”
37045	37104	37025	37025	he	179	“ you will make me confess . The only time I saw Miss Hale , she treated me with a haughty civility which had a strong flavour of contempt in it . She held herself aloof from me as if she had been a queen , and I her humble , unwashed vassal . Be easy , mother . ”
37105	37152	37154	37154	he	1403	“ No ! I am not easy nor content either . What business had she , a renegade clergyman ’s daughter , to turn up her nose at you ! I would dress for none of them — a saucy set ! if I were you . ”
37163	37203	37159	37159	he	1403	“ Mr. Hale is good , and gentle , and learned . He is not saucy . As for Mrs. Hale , I will tell you what she is like to - night , if you care to hear . ”
37213	37297	37204	37204	He	1403	“ Despise my son ! treat him as her vassal , indeed ! Humph ! I should like to know where she could find such another ! Boy and man , he ’s the noblest , stoutest heart I ever knew . I do n’t care if I am his mother ; I can see what ’s what , and not be blind . I know what Fanny is ; and I know what John is . Despise him ! I hate her ! ”

37925	37930	37921	37921	He	179	exclaimed—“There it goes again ! ”
38707	38803	38838	38839	her father	444	“ And this imagination of power , this practical realisation of a gigantic thought , came out of one man ’s brain in our good town . That very man has it within him to mount , step by step , on each wonder he achieves to higher marvels still . And I ’ll be bound to say , we have many among us who , if he were gone , could spring into the breach and carry on the war which compels , and shall compel , all material power to yield to science . ”
38804	38836	38838	38839	her father	444	“ Your boast reminds me of the old lines — ‘ I ’ve a hundred captains in England , ’ he said , ‘ As good as ever was he . ’ ”
38870	38878	38880	38881	Mr. Thornton	179	“ It is no boast of mine , ”
38883	38990	38880	38881	Mr. Thornton	179	“ it is plain matter - of - fact . I wo n’t deny that I am proud of belonging to a town — or perhaps I should rather say a district — the necessities of which give birth to such grandeur of conception . I would rather be a man toiling , suffering — nay , failing and successless — here , than lead a dull prosperous life in the old worn grooves of what you call more aristocratic society down in the South , with their slow days of careless ease . One may be clogged with honey and unable to rise and fly . ”
38991	38996	38998	38998	Margaret	123	“ You are mistaken , ”
39030	39150	39151	39151	she	123	“ You do not know anything about the South . If there is less adventure or less progress — I suppose I must not say less excitement — from the gambling spirit of trade , which seems requisite to force out these wonderful inventions , there is less suffering also . I see men here going about in the streets who look ground down by some pinching sorrow or care — who are not only sufferers but haters . Now , in the South we have our poor , but there is not that terrible expression in their countenances of a sullen sense of injustice which I see here . You do not know the South , Mr. Thornton , ”
39170	39182	39184	39184	he	1448	“ And may I say you do not know the North ? ”
39241	39249	39251	39252	Mrs. Hale	142	“ At any rate , Mr. Thornton , ”
39254	39278	39251	39252	Mrs. Hale	142	“ you will allow that Milton is a much more smoky , dirty town than you will ever meet with in the South . ”
39279	39290	39292	39293	Mr. Thornton	179	“ I ’m afraid I must give up its cleanliness , ”
39301	39334	39292	39293	Mr. Thornton	179	“ But we are bidden by parliament to burn our own smoke ; so I suppose , like good little children , we shall do as we are bid — some time . ”
39335	39358	39360	39361	Mr. Hale	134	“ But I think you told me you had altered your chimneys so as to consume the smoke , did you not ? ”
39363	39502	39360	39361	Mr. Hale	134	“ Mine were altered by my own will , before parliament meddled with the affair . It was an immediate outlay , but it repays me in the saving of coal . I ’m not sure whether I should have done it , if I had waited until the act was passed . At any rate , I should have waited to be informed against and fined , and given all the trouble in yielding that I legally could . But all laws which depend for their enforcement upon informers and fines , become inert from the odiousness of the machinery . I doubt if there has been a chimney in Milton informed against for five years past , although some are constantly sending out one - third of their coal in what is called here unparliamentary smoke . ”
39503	39580	39251	39252	Mrs. Hale	142	“ I only know it is impossible to keep the muslin blinds clean here above a week together ; and at Helstone we have had them up for a month or more , and they have not looked dirty at the end of that time . And as for hands — Margaret , how many times did you say you had washed your hands this morning before twelve o’clock ? Three times , was it not ? ”
39581	39586	39360	39361	Mr. Hale	134	“ Yes , mamma . ”
39587	39612	39614	39615	Mr. Hale	134	“ You seem to have a strong objection to acts of parliament and all legislation affecting your mode of management down here at Milton , ”
39617	39916	39614	39615	Mr. Hale	134	“ Yes , I have ; and many others have as well . And with justice , I think . The whole machinery — I do n’t mean the wood and iron machinery now — of the cotton trade is so new that it is no wonder if it does not work well in every part all at once . Seventy years ago what was it ? And now what it is not ? Raw , crude materials came together ; men of the same level , as regarded education and station , took suddenly the different position of masters and men , owing to the motherwit , as regarded opportunities and probabilities , which distinguished some , and made them far - seeing as to what great future lay concealed in that rude model of Sir Richard Arkwright ’s . The rapid development of what might be called a new trade , gave those early masters enormous power of wealth and command . I do n’t mean merely over the workmen ; I mean over purchasers — over the whole world ’s market . Why , I may give you , as an instance , an advertisement , inserted not fifty years ago in a Milton paper , that so - and - so ( one of the half - dozen calico - printers of the time ) would close his warehouse at noon each day ; therefore , that all purchasers must come before that hour . Fancy a man dictating in this manner the time when he would sell and when he would not sell . Now , I believe , if a good customer chose to come at midnight , I should get up , and stand hat in hand to receive his orders . ”
39941	40210	39935	39935	herself	123	“ I only name such things to show what almost unlimited power the manufacturers had about the beginning of this century . The men were rendered dizzy by it . Because a man was successful in his ventures , there was no reason that in all other things his mind should be well - balanced . On the contrary , his sense of justice , and his simplicity , were often utterly smothered under the glut of wealth that came down upon him ; and they tell strange tales of the wild extravagance of living indulged in on gala - days by those early cotton - lords . There can be no doubt , too , of the tyranny they exercised over their work - people . You know the proverb , Mr. Hale , ‘ Set a beggar on horseback , and he ’ll ride to the devil,’—well , some of these early manufacturers did ride to the devil in a magnificent style — crushing human bone and flesh under their horses ’ hoofs without remorse . But by - and - by came a reaction ; there were more factories , more masters ; more men were wanted . The power of masters and men became more evenly balanced ; and now the battle is pretty fairly waged between us . We will hardly submit to the decision of an umpire , much less to the interference of a meddler with only a smattering of the knowledge of the real facts of the case , even though that meddler be called the High Court of Parliament . ”
40211	40225	40227	40228	Mr. Hale	134	“ Is there necessity for calling it a battle between the two classes ? ”
40230	40258	40227	40228	Mr. Hale	134	“ I know , from your using the term , it is one which gives a true idea of the real state of things to your mind . ”
40259	40391	39935	39935	herself	123	“ It is true ; and I believe it to be as much a necessity as that prudent wisdom and good conduct are always opposed to , and doing battle with ignorance and improvidence . It is one of the great beauties of our system , that a working - man may raise himself into the power and position of a master by his own exertions and behaviour ; that , in fact , every one who rules himself to decency and sobriety of conduct , and attention to his duties , comes over to our ranks ; it may not be always as a master , but as an overlooker , a cashier , a book - keeper , a clerk , one on the side of authority and order . ”
40392	40422	40424	40424	Margaret	123	“ You consider all who are unsuccessful in raising themselves in the world , from whatever cause , as your enemies , then , if I understand you rightly , ”
40433	40441	40443	40443	he	1449	“ As their own enemies , certainly , ”
40612	40917	40609	40609	he	1449	“ I am not speaking without book . Sixteen years ago , my father died under very miserable circumstances . I was taken from school , and had to become a man ( as well as I could ) in a few days . I had such a mother as few are blest with ; a woman of strong power , and firm resolve . We went into a small country town , where living was cheaper than in Milton , and where I got employment in a draper ’s shop ( a capital place , by the way , for obtaining a knowledge of goods ) . Week by week , our income came to fifteen shillings , out of which three people had to be kept . My mother managed so that I put by three out of these fifteen shillings regularly . This made the beginning ; this taught me self - denial . Now that I am able to afford my mother such comforts as her age , rather than her own wish , requires , I thank her silently on each occasion for the early training she gave me . Now when I feel that in my own case it is no good luck , nor merit , nor talent,—but simply the habits of life which taught me to despise indulgences not thoroughly earned,—indeed , never to think twice about them,—I believe that this suffering , which Miss Hale says is impressed on the countenances of the people of Milton , is but the natural punishment of dishonestly - enjoyed pleasure , at some former period of their lives . I do not look on self - indulgent , sensual people as worthy of my hatred ; I simply look upon them with contempt for their poorness of character . ”
40918	40929	40931	40932	Mr. Hale	134	“ But you have the rudiments of a good education , ”
40934	40974	40931	40932	Mr. Hale	134	“ The quick zest with which you are now reading Homer , shows me that you do not come to it as an unknown book : you have read it before , and are only recalling your old knowledge . ”
40975	41073	40609	40609	he	1449	“ That is true,—I had blundered along it at school ; I dare say , I was even considered a pretty fair classic in those days , though my Latin and Greek have slipt away from me since . But I ask you , what preparation were they for such a life as I had to lead ? None at all . Utterly none at all . On the point of education , any man who can read and write starts fair with me in the amount of really useful knowledge that I had at that time . ”
41074	41110	40931	40932	Mr. Hale	134	“ Well ! I do n’t agree with you . But there I am perhaps somewhat of a pedant . Did not the recollection of the heroic simplicity of the Homeric life nerve you up ? ”
41111	41116	41118	41119	Mr. Thornton	179	“ Not one bit ! ”
41123	41189	41118	41119	Mr. Thornton	179	“ I was too busy to think about any dead people , with the living pressing alongside of me , neck to neck , in the struggle for bread . Now that I have my mother safe in the quiet peace that becomes her age , and duly rewards her former exertions , I can turn to all that old narration and thoroughly enjoy it . ”
41190	41209	41211	41212	Mr. Hale	134	“ I dare say , my remark came from the professional feeling of there being nothing like leather , ”
41332	41359	41315	41315	himself	179	“ A more proud , disagreeable girl I never saw . Even her great beauty is blotted out of one ’s memory by her scornful ways . ”
41366	41406	41407	41407	ANON	223	“ There ’s iron , they say , in all our blood , And a grain or two perhaps is good ; But his , he makes me harshly feel , Has got a little too much of steel . ”
41409	41412	41417	41417	he	134	“ Margaret ! ”
41425	41483	41414	41415	Mr. Hale	134	“ I could not help watching your face with some anxiety , when Mr. Thornton made his confession of having been a shop - boy . I knew it all along from Mr. Bell ; so I was aware of what was coming ; but I half expected to see you get up and leave the room . ”
41484	41657	41669	41670	her mother	469	“ Oh , papa ! you do n’t mean that you thought me so silly ? I really liked that account of himself better than anything else he said . Everything else revolted me , from its hardness ; but he spoke about himself so simply — with so little of the pretence that makes the vulgarity of shop - people , and with such tender respect for his mother , that I was less likely to leave the room then than when he was boasting about Milton , as if there was not such another place in the world ; or quietly professing to despise people for careless , wasteful improvidence , without ever seeming to think it his duty to try to make them different,—to give them anything of the training which his mother gave him , and to which he evidently owes his position , whatever that may be . No ! his statement of having been a shop - boy was the thing I liked best of all . ”
41658	41667	41669	41670	her mother	469	“ I am surprised at you , Margaret , ”
41672	41753	41669	41670	her mother	469	“ You who were always accusing people of being shoppy at Helstone ! I do n’t think , Mr. Hale , you have done quite right in introducing such a person to us without telling us what he had been . I really was very much afraid of showing him how much shocked I was at some parts of what he said . His father ‘ dying in miserable circumstances . ’ Why it might have been in the workhouse . ”
41754	41769	41771	41772	her husband	594	“ I am not sure it was not worse than being in the workhouse , ”
41774	42117	41771	41772	her husband	594	“ I heard a good deal of his previous life from Mr. Bell before we came here ; and as he has told you a part , I will fill up what he left out . His father speculated wildly , failed , and then killed himself , because he could not bear the disgrace . All his former friends shrunk from the disclosures that had to be made of his dishonest gambling — wild , hopeless struggles , made with other people ’s money , to regain his own moderate portion of wealth . No one came forward to help the mother and this boy . There was another child , I believe , a girl ; too young to earn money , but of course she had to be kept . At least , no friend came forward immediately , and Mrs. Thornton is not one , I fancy , to wait till tardy kindness comes to find her out . So they left Milton . I knew he had gone into a shop , and that his earnings , with some fragment of property secured to his mother , had been made to keep them for a long time . Mr. Bell said they absolutely lived upon water - porridge for years — how , he did not know ; but long after the creditors had given up hope of any payment of old Mr. Thornton ’s debts ( if , indeed , they ever had hoped at all about it , after his suicide ) , this young man returned to Milton , and went quietly round to each creditor , paying him the first instalment of the money owing to him . No noise — no gathering together of creditors — it was done very silently and quietly , but all was paid at last ; helped on materially by the circumstance of one of the creditors , a crabbed old fellow ( Mr. Bell says ) , taking in Mr. Thornton as a kind of partner . ”
42118	42124	42126	42126	Margaret	123	“ That really is fine , ”
42128	42146	42126	42126	Margaret	123	“ What a pity such a nature should be tainted by his position as a Milton manufacturer . ”
42147	42151	42153	42154	her father	444	“ How tainted ? ”
42156	42236	42153	42154	her father	444	“ Oh , papa , by that testing everything by the standard of wealth . When he spoke of the mechanical powers , he evidently looked upon them only as new ways of extending trade and making money . And the poor men around him — they were poor because they were vicious — out of the pale of his sympathies because they had not his iron nature , and the capabilities that it gives him for being rich . ”
42237	42255	42256	42256	Margaret	123	“ Not vicious ; he never said that . Improvident and self - indulgent were his words . ”
42317	42340	42348	42349	her father	444	“ Papa , I do think Mr. Thornton a very remarkable man ; but personally I do n’t like him at all . ”
42341	42346	42348	42349	her father	444	“ And I do ! ”
42352	42397	42348	42349	her father	444	“ Personally , as you call it , and all . I do n’t set him up for a hero , or anything of that kind . But good - night , child . Your mother looks sadly tired to - night , Margaret . ”
42831	42851	42816	42816	she	123	“ Well , Bessy , how are you ? Better , I hope , now the wind has changed . ”
42852	42866	42816	42816	she	123	“ Better and not better , if yo ’ know what that means . ”
42867	42871	42873	42873	Margaret	123	“ Not exactly , ”
42877	42940	42873	42873	Margaret	123	“ I ’m better in not being torn to pieces by coughing o ’ nights , but I ’m weary and tired o ’ Milton , and longing to get away to the land o ’ Beulah ? and when I think I ’m farther and farther off , my heart sinks , and I ’m no better ; I ’m worse . ”
42976	42985	42969	42969	she	123	“ Bessy , do you wish to die ? ”
43023	43125	43020	43020	she	204	“ If yo’d led the life I have , and getten as weary of it as I have , and thought at times , ‘ maybe it ’ll last for fifty or sixty years — it does wi ’ some,’—and got dizzy and dazed , and sick , as each of them sixty years seemed to spin about me , and mock me with its length of hours and minutes , and endless bits o ’ time — oh , wench ! I tell thee thou’d been glad enough when th ’ doctor said he feared thou’d never see another winter . ”
43126	43140	43020	43020	she	204	“ Why , Bessy , what kind of a life has yours been ? ”
43141	43163	43020	43020	she	204	“ Nought worse than many others ’ , I reckon . Only I fretted against it , and they did n’t . ”
43164	43202	43020	43020	she	204	“ But what was it ? You know , I ’m a stranger here , so perhaps I ’m not so quick at understanding what you mean as if I ’d lived all my life at Milton . ”
43203	43253	43020	43020	she	204	“ If yo’d ha ’ come to our house when yo ’ said yo ’ would , I could maybe ha ’ told you . But father says yo’re just like th ’ rest on ’em ; its out o ’ sight out o ’ mind wi ’ you . ”
43254	43284	43020	43020	she	204	“ I do n’t know who the rest are ; and I ’ve been very busy ; and , to tell the truth , I had forgotten my promise — ”
43285	43297	43020	43020	she	204	“ Yo ’ offered it ; we asked none of it . ”
43298	43309	43311	43311	Margaret	123	“ I had forgotten what I said for the time , ”
43314	43335	43311	43311	Margaret	123	“ I should have thought of it again when I was less busy . May I go with you now ? ”
43376	43397	43367	43367	she	123	“ I ha ’ none so many to care for me ; if yo ’ care yo ’ may come . ”
43424	43481	43421	43421	Bessy	204	“ Yo’ll not be daunted if father ’s at home , and speaks a bit gruffish at first . He took a mind to ye , yo ’ see , and he thought a deal o ’ your coming to see us ; and just because he liked yo ’ he was vexed and put about . ”
43482	43489	43421	43421	Bessy	204	“ Do n’t fear , Bessy . ”
43617	43630	43632	43632	Bessy	204	“ Do you think such life as this is worth caring for ? ”
43674	43698	43669	43669	her	123	“ They shall hunger no more , neither thirst any more : neither shall the sun light on them , nor any heat . ”
43705	43737	43699	43699	Margaret	123	“ Bessy do n’t be impatient with your life , whatever it is — or may have been . Remember who gave it you , and made it what it is ! ”
43757	43821	43748	43748	he	202	“ Now , I ’ll not have my wench preached to . She ’s bad enough , as it is , with her dreams and her methodee fancies , and her visions of cities with goulden gates and precious stones . But if it amuses her I let it abe , but I ’m none going to have more stuff poured into her . ”
43822	43826	43828	43828	Margaret	123	“ But surely , ”
43833	43858	43828	43828	Margaret	123	“ you believe in what I said , that God gave her life , and ordered what kind of life it was to be ? ”
43859	43976	43985	43985	she	204	“ I believe what I see , and no more . That ’s what I believe , young woman . I do n’t believe all I hear — no ! not by a big deal . I did hear a young lass make an ado about knowing where we lived , and coming to see us . And my wench here thought a deal about it , and flushed up many a time , when hoo little knew as I was looking at her , at the sound of a strange step . But hoo ’s come at last,—and hoo ’s welcome , as long as hoo’ll keep from preaching on what hoo knows nought about . ”
44006	44059	44061	44061	she	204	“ Do n’t be vexed wi ’ him — there ’s many a one thinks like him : many and many a one here . If yo ’ could hear them speak , yo’d not be shocked at him ; he ’s a rare good man , is father — but oh ! ”
44068	44101	44061	44061	she	204	“ what he says at times makes me long to die more than ever , for I want to know so many things , and am so tossed about wi ’ wonder . ”
44102	44216	44314	44314	Margaret	123	“ Poor wench — poor old wench — I’m loth to vex thee , I am ; but a man mun speak out for the truth , and when I see the world going all wrong at this time o ’ day , bothering itself wi ’ things it knows nought about , and leaving undone all the things that lie in disorder close at its hand — why , I say , leave a ’ this talk about religion alone , and set to work on what yo ’ see and know . That ’s my creed . It ’s simple , and not far to fetch , nor hard to work . ”
44227	44267	44218	44219	the girl	5516	“ Do n’t think hardly on him — he ’s a good man , he is . I sometimes think I shall be moped wi ’ sorrow even in the City of God , if father is not there . ”
44284	44301	44302	44302	She	123	“ But you will be there , father ! you shall ! Oh ! my heart ! ”
44377	44380	44375	44375	Margaret	123	“ hush ! ”
44399	44411	44394	44394	herself	204	“ I ’ll go to bed,—it ’s best place ; but , ”
44418	44432	44394	44394	herself	204	“ yo’ll come again,—I know yo ’ will — but just say it ! ”
44433	44442	44444	44444	Margaret	123	“ I will come again to - morrow , ”
44473	44493	44467	44467	he	444	“ I could wish there were a God , if it were only to ask Him to bless thee . ”
44557	44567	44549	44549	Margaret	123	“ Have you met with a servant , dear ? ”
44568	44581	44522	44523	her mother	469	“ No , mamma ; that Anne Buckley would never have done . ”
44582	44587	44589	44590	Mr. Hale	134	“ Suppose I try , ”
44592	44622	44589	44590	Mr. Hale	134	“ Everybody else has had their turn at this great difficulty . Now let me try . I may be the Cinderella to put on the slipper after all . ”
44643	44658	44635	44635	she	123	“ What would you do , papa ? How would you set about it ? ”
44659	44682	44589	44590	Mr. Hale	134	“ Why , I should apply to some good house - mother to recommend me one known to herself or her servants . ”
44683	44697	44589	44590	Mr. Hale	134	“ Very good . But we must first catch our house - mother . ”
44698	44727	44635	44635	she	123	“ You have caught her . Or rather she is coming into the snare , and you will catch her to - morrow , if you ’re skilful . ”
44728	44737	44739	44740	his wife	592	“ What do you mean , Mr. Hale ? ”
44746	44776	44739	44740	his wife	592	“ Why , my paragon pupil ( as Margaret calls him ) has told me that his mother intends to call on Mrs. and Miss Hale to - morrow . ”
44777	44781	44783	44784	Mrs. Hale	142	“ Mrs. Thornton ! ”
44786	44796	44798	44798	Margaret	123	“ The mother of whom he spoke to us ? ”
44800	44813	44815	44816	Mr. Hale	134	“ Mrs. Thornton ; the only mother he has , I believe , ”
44820	44835	44836	44837	her mother	469	“ I shall like to see her . She must be an uncommon person , ”
44840	44881	44836	44837	her mother	469	“ Perhaps she may have a relation who might suit us , and be glad of our place . She sounded to be such a careful economical person , that I should like any one out of the same family . ”
44882	44886	44888	44889	Mr. Hale	134	“ My dear , ”
44892	44966	44888	44889	Mr. Hale	134	“ Pray do n’t go off on that idea . I fancy Mrs. Thornton is as haughty and proud in her way as our little Margaret here is in hers , and that she completely ignores that old time of trial , and poverty , and economy , of which he speaks so openly . I am sure , at any rate , she would not like strangers to know anything about it . ”
44967	45003	44888	44889	Mr. Hale	134	“ Take notice that is not my kind of haughtiness , papa , if I have any at all ; which I do n’t agree to , though you ’re always accusing me of it . ”
45004	45030	45031	45031	They	1505	“ I do n’t know positively that it is hers either ; but from little things I have gathered from him , I fancy so . ”
45118	45126	45127	45127	FRIENDS	461	“ Well — I suppose we must . ”
45224	45227	45257	45257	she	5657	“ killed off ”
45303	45345	45300	45300	she	5657	“ she saw no use in making up friendships and intimacies with all the teachers and masters in Milton ; why , he would be wanting her to call on Fanny ’s dancing - master ’s wife , the next thing ! ”
45346	45371	45300	45300	she	5657	“ And so I would , mother , if Mr. Mason and his wife were friendless in a strange place , like the Hales . ”
45372	45399	45300	45300	she	5657	“ Oh ! you need not speak so hastily . I am going to - morrow . I only wanted you exactly to understand about it . ”
45400	45414	45300	45300	she	5657	“ If you are going to - morrow , I shall order horses . ”
45415	45429	45300	45300	she	5657	“ Nonsense , John . One would think you were made of money . ”
45430	45464	45300	45300	she	5657	“ Not quite , yet . But about the horses I ’m determined . The last time you were out in a cab , you came home with a headache from the jolting . ”
45465	45476	45300	45300	she	5657	“ I never complained of it , I ’m sure . ”
45477	45488	45490	45490	he	1517	“ No ! my mother is not given to complaints , ”
45496	45524	45490	45490	he	1517	“ But so much the more I have to watch over you . Now , as for Fanny there , a little hardship would do her good . ”
45525	45546	45547	45548	Mrs. Thornton	216	“ She is not made of the same stuff as you are , John . She could not bear it . ”
45841	45844	45830	45830	She	216	“ love , ”
45846	45849	45830	45830	She	216	“ dear , ”
45881	45942	45872	45872	she	216	“ Fanny dear ! I shall have horses to the carriage to - day , to go and call on these Hales . Should not you go and see nurse ? It ’s in the same direction , and she ’s always so glad to see you . You could go on there while I am at Mrs. Hale ’s . ”
45943	45961	45971	45971	her	216	“ Oh ! mamma , it ’s such a long way , and I am so tired . ”
45962	45966	45968	45969	Mrs. Thornton	216	“ With what ? ”
45976	46026	45968	45969	Mrs. Thornton	216	“ I do n’t know — the weather , I think . It is so relaxing . Could n’t you bring nurse here , mamma ? The carriage could fetch her , and she could spend the rest of the day here , which I know she would like . ”
46047	46062	46063	46063	she	216	“ It will be a long way for her to walk back at night ! ”
46069	46089	46063	46063	she	216	“ Oh , but I will send her home in a cab . I never thought of her walking . ”
46106	46139	46094	46095	Mr. Thornton	179	“ Mother ! I need hardly say , that if there is any little thing that could serve Mrs. Hale as an invalid , you will offer it , I ’m sure . ”
46140	46170	46063	46063	she	216	“ If I can find it out , I will . But I have never been ill myself , so I am not much up to invalids ’ fancies . ”
46171	46201	46094	46095	Mr. Thornton	179	“ Well ! here is Fanny then , who is seldom without an ailment . She will be able to suggest something , perhaps — won’t you , Fan ? ”
46202	46210	46212	46212	Fanny	218	“ I have not always an ailment , ”
46216	46240	46212	46212	Fanny	218	“ and I am not going with mamma . I have a headache to - day , and I sha n’t go out . ”
46265	46274	46276	46276	he	179	“ Fanny ! I wish you to go , ”
46280	46306	46276	46276	he	179	“ It will do you good , instead of harm . You will oblige me by going , without my saying anything more about it . ”
46343	46349	46338	46338	he	179	“ You will oblige me . ”
46357	46393	46354	46354	she	218	“ John always speaks as if I fancied I was ill , and I am sure I never do fancy any such thing . Who are these Hales that he makes such a fuss about ? ”
46394	46432	46354	46354	she	218	“ Fanny , do n’t speak so of your brother . He has good reasons of some kind or other , or he would not wish us to go . Make haste and put your things on . ”
46451	46455	46456	46456	Her	216	“ these Hales . ”
46465	46483	46456	46456	Her	216	“ Who are they , that he is so anxious we should pay them all this attention ? ”
46631	46636	46638	46639	Mrs. Thornton	216	baby—“Flimsy , useless work , ”
46747	46750	46752	46752	she	216	“ lace , ”
46758	46797	46752	46752	she	216	“ of that old English point which has not been made for this seventy years , and which can not be bought . It must have been an heir - loom , and shows that she had ancestors . ”
46862	46870	46872	46872	Fanny	218	“ I suppose you are not musical , ”
46874	46881	46872	46872	Fanny	218	“ as I see no piano . ”
46882	46920	46959	46959	herself	123	“ I am fond of hearing good music ; I can not play well myself ; and papa and mamma do n’t care much about it ; so we sold our old piano when we came here . ”
46921	46941	46959	46959	herself	123	“ I wonder how you can exist without one . It almost seems to me a necessary of life . ”
46942	46955	46957	46957	Margaret	123	“ Fifteen shillings a week , and three saved out of them ! ”
46961	46987	46957	46957	Margaret	123	“ But she must have been very young . She probably has forgotten her own personal experience . But she must know of those days . ”
47004	47014	46988	46988	Margaret	123	“ You have good concerts here , I believe . ”
47015	47065	46959	46959	herself	123	“ Oh , yes ! Delicious ! Too crowded , that is the worst . The directors admit so indiscriminately . But one is sure to hear the newest music there . I always have a large order to give to Johnson ’s , the day after a concert . ”
47066	47079	46957	46957	Margaret	123	“ Do you like new music simply for its newness , then ? ”
47080	47112	46988	46988	Margaret	123	“ Oh ; one knows it is the fashion in London , or else the singers would not bring it down here . You have been in London , of course . ”
47113	47116	47118	47118	Margaret	123	“ Yes , ”
47120	47129	47118	47118	Margaret	123	“ I have lived there for several years . ”
47130	47146	46957	46957	Margaret	123	“ Oh ! London and the Alhambra are the two places I long to see ! ”
47147	47153	46957	46957	Margaret	123	“ London and the Alhambra ! ”
47154	47173	46957	46957	Margaret	123	“ Yes ! ever since I read the Tales of the Alhambra . Do n’t you know them ? ”
47174	47194	46957	46957	Margaret	123	“ I do n’t think I do . But surely , it is a very easy journey to London . ”
47195	47201	47203	47203	Fanny	218	“ Yes ; but somehow , ”
47209	47255	47206	47206	her	218	“ mamma has never been to London herself , and ca n’t understand my longing . She is very proud of Milton ; dirty , smoky place as I feel it to be . I believe she admires it the more for those very qualities . ”
47256	47277	47279	47279	Margaret	123	“ If it has been Mrs. Thornton ’s home for some years , I can well understand her loving it , ”
47290	47305	47279	47279	Margaret	123	“ What are you saying about me , Miss Hale ? May I inquire ? ”
47332	47351	47328	47329	Miss Thornton	232	“ Oh , mamma ! we are only trying to account for your being so fond of Milton . ”
47352	47356	47358	47359	Mrs. Thornton	216	“ Thank you , ”
47361	47396	47358	47359	Mrs. Thornton	216	“ I do not feel that my very natural liking for the place where I was born and brought up,—and which has since been my residence for some years , requires any accounting for . ”
47449	47472	47439	47440	Mrs. Thornton	216	“ Do you know anything of Milton , Miss Hale ? Have you seen any of our factories ? our magnificent warehouses ? ”
47473	47476	47478	47478	Margaret	123	“ No ! ”
47480	47492	47478	47478	Margaret	123	“ I have not seen anything of that description as yet . ”
47520	47550	47516	47516	she	123	“ I dare say , papa would have taken me before now if I had cared . But I really do not find much pleasure in going over manufactories . ”
47551	47558	47560	47561	Mrs. Hale	142	“ They are very curious places , ”
47563	47594	47560	47561	Mrs. Hale	142	“ but there is so much noise and dirt always . I remember once going in a lilac silk to see candles made , and my gown was utterly ruined . ”
47595	47599	47601	47602	Mrs. Thornton	216	“ Very probably , ”
47610	47744	47601	47602	Mrs. Thornton	216	“ I merely thought , that as strangers newly come to reside in a town which has risen to eminence in the country , from the character and progress of its peculiar business , you might have cared to visit some of the places where it is carried on ; places unique in the kingdom , I am informed . If Miss Hale changes her mind and condescends to be curious as to the manufactures of Milton , I can only say I shall be glad to procure her admission to print - works , or reed - making , or the more simple operations of spinning carried on in my son ’s mill . Every improvement of machinery is , I believe , to be seen there , in its highest perfection . ”
47745	47765	47767	47767	Fanny	218	“ I am so glad you do n’t like mills and manufactories , and all those kind of things , ”
47794	47811	47813	47813	Margaret	123	“ I think I should like to know all about them , if I were you , ”
47816	47819	47821	47822	her mother	469	“ Fanny ! ”
47829	47877	47821	47822	her mother	469	“ we will be civil to these Hales : but do n’t form one of your hasty friendships with the daughter . She will do you no good , I see . The mother looks very ill , and seems a nice , quiet kind of person . ”
47878	47893	47895	47895	Fanny	218	“ I do n’t want to form any friendship with Miss Hale , mamma , ”
47899	47918	47895	47895	Fanny	218	“ I thought I was doing my duty by talking to her , and trying to amuse her . ”

TRENCH	234	“ That doubt and trouble , fear and pain , And anguish , all , are shadows vain , That death itself shall not remain ; That weary deserts we may tread , A dreary labyrinth may thread . Thro ’ dark ways underground be led ; Yet , if we will one Guide obey , The dreariest path , the darkest way Shall issue out in heavenly day ; And we , on divers shores now cast , Shall meet , our perilous voyage past , All in our Father ’s house at last ! ”
48326	48387	48277	48277	Margaret	123	“ I never knew why folk in the Bible cared for soft raiment afore . But it must be nice to go dressed as yo ’ do . It ’s different fro ’ common . Most fine folk tire my eyes out wi ’ their colours ; but some how yours rest me . Where did ye get this frock ? ”
48388	48392	48394	48394	Margaret	123	“ In London , ”
48399	48409	48394	48394	Margaret	123	“ London ! Have yo ’ been in London ? ”
48410	48432	48277	48277	Margaret	123	“ Yes ! I lived there for some years . But my home was in a forest ; in the country . ”
48433	48439	48441	48441	Bessy	204	“ Tell me about it , ”
48443	48461	48441	48441	Bessy	204	“ I like to hear speak of the country , and trees , and such like things . ”
48550	48704	48542	48542	her	123	“ Oh , Bessy , I loved the home we have left so dearly ! I wish you could see it . I can not tell you half its beauty . There are great trees standing all about it , with their branches stretching long and level , and making a deep shade of rest even at noonday . And yet , though every leaf may seem still , there is a continual rushing sound of movement all around — not close at hand . Then sometimes the turf is as soft and fine as velvet ; and sometimes quite lush with the perpetual moisture of a little , hidden , tinkling brook near at hand . And then in other parts there are billowy ferns — whole stretches of fern ; some in the green shadow ; some with long streaks of golden sunlight lying on them — just like the sea . ”
48705	48713	48715	48715	Bessy	204	“ I have never seen the sea , ”
48717	48722	48715	48715	Bessy	204	“ But go on . ”
48723	48746	48542	48542	her	123	“ Then here and there , there are wide commons , high up as if above the very tops of the trees — ”
48747	48852	48715	48715	Bessy	204	“ I am glad of that . I felt smothered like down below . When I have gone for an out , I ’ve always wanted to get high up and see far away , and take a deep breath o ’ fulness in that air . I get smothered enough in Milton , and I think the sound yo ’ speak of among the trees , going on for ever and ever , would send me dazed ; it ’s that made my head ache so in the mill . Now on these commons , I reckon , there is but little noise ? ”
48853	48856	48858	48858	Margaret	123	“ No , ”
48860	48923	48858	48858	Margaret	123	“ nothing but here and there a lark high in the air . Sometimes I used to hear a farmer speaking sharp and loud to his servants ; but it was so far away that it only reminded me pleasantly that other people were hard at work in some distant place , while I just sat on the heather and did nothing . ”
48924	49035	49087	49087	she	204	“ I used to think once that if I could have a day of doing nothing , to rest me — a day in some quiet place like that yo ’ speak on — it would maybe set me up . But now I ’ve had many days o ’ idleness , and I ’m just as weary ’ o them as I was o ’ my work . Sometimes I ’m so tired out I think I can not enjoy heaven without a piece of rest first . I ’m rather afeard o ’ going straight there without getting a good sleep in the grave to set me up . ”
49036	49044	49046	49046	Margaret	123	“ Do n’t be afraid , Bessy , ”
49057	49081	49046	49046	Margaret	123	“ God can give you more perfect rest than even idleness on earth , or the dead sleep of the grave can do . ”
49090	49326	49328	49328	she	1572	“ I wish father would not speak to me as he does . He means well , as I telled yo ’ yesterday , and tell yo ’ again and again . But yo ’ see , though I do n’t believe him a bit by day , yet by night — when I ’m in a fever , half asleep and half awake — it comes back upon me — oh ! so bad ! And I think , if this should be th ’ end of all , and if all I ’ve been born for is just to work my heart and my life away , and to sicken i ’ this dree place , wi ’ them mill - noises in my ears for ever , until I could scream out for them to stop , and let me have a little piece o ’ quiet — and wi ’ the fluff filling my lungs , until I thirst to death for one long deep breath o ’ the clear air yo ’ speak on — and my mother gone , and I never able to tell her again how I loved her , and o ’ all my troubles — I think if this life is th ’ end , and there ’s no God to wipe away all tears from all eyes — yo ’ wench , yo ’ ! ”
49345	49358	49328	49328	she	1572	“ I could go mad , and kill yo , I could . ”
49375	49385	49369	49369	Margaret	123	“ Bessy — we have a Father in Heaven . ”
49386	49395	49397	49397	she	1572	“ I know it ! I know it , ”
49408	49445	49397	49397	she	1572	“ I ’m very wicked . I ’ve spoken very wickedly . Oh ! do n’t be frightened by me and never come again . I would not harm a hair of your head . And , ”
49456	49513	49397	49397	she	1572	“ I believe , perhaps , more than yo ’ do o ’ what ’s to come . I read the book o ’ Revelations until I know it off by heart , and I never doubt when I ’m waking , and in my senses , of all the glory I ’m to come to . ”
49514	49548	49369	49369	Margaret	123	“ Do n’t let us talk of what fancies come into your head when you are feverish . I would rather hear something about what you used to do when you were well . ”
49549	49597	49397	49397	she	1572	“ I think I was well when mother died , but I have never been rightly strong sin ’ somewhere about that time . I began to work in a carding - room soon after , and the fluff got into my lungs , and poisoned me . ”
49598	49601	49603	49603	Margaret	123	“ Fluff ? ”
49607	49610	49603	49603	Margaret	123	“ Fluff , ”
49614	49692	49603	49603	Margaret	123	“ Little bits , as fly off fro ’ the cotton , when they ’re carding it , and fill the air till it looks all fine white dust . They say it winds rounds the lungs , and tightens them up . Anyhow , there ’s many a one as works in a carding - room , that falls into a waste , coughing and spitting blood , because they ’re just poisoned by the fluff . ”
49693	49701	49703	49703	Margaret	123	“ But ca n’t it be helped ? ”
49705	49865	49703	49703	Margaret	123	“ I dunno . Some folk have a great wheel at one end o ’ their carding - rooms to make a draught , and carry off th ’ dust ; but that wheel costs a deal of money — five or six hundred pounds , maybe , and brings in no profit ; so it ’s but a few of th ’ masters as will put ’em up ; and I ’ve heard tell o ’ men who did n’t like working in places where there was a wheel , because they said as how it made ’em hungry , at after they ’d been long used to swallowing fluff , to go without it , and that their wages ought to be raised if they were to work in such places . So between masters and men th ’ wheels fall through . I know I wish there ’d been a wheel in our place , though . ”
49866	49875	49877	49877	Margaret	123	“ Did not your father know about it ? ”
49879	50029	49877	49877	Margaret	123	“ Yes ! And he was sorry . But our factory were a good one on the whole ; and a steady likely set o ’ people ; and father was afeard of letting me go to a strange place , for though yo ’ would na think it now , many a one then used to call me a gradely lass enough . And I did na like to be reckoned nesh and soft , and Mary ’s schooling were to be kept up , mother said , and father he were always liking to buy books , and go to lectures o ’ one kind and another — all which took money — so I just worked on till I shall ne’er get the whirr out o ’ my ears , or the fluff out o ’ my throat i ’ this world . That ’s all . ”
50030	50036	50038	50038	Margaret	123	“ How old are you ? ”
50040	50046	50038	50038	Margaret	123	“ Nineteen , come July . ”
50047	50054	50055	50055	She	123	“ And I too am nineteen . ”
50088	50092	50094	50094	Bessy	204	“ About Mary , ”
50096	50146	50094	50094	Bessy	204	“ I wanted to ask yo ’ to be a friend to her . She ’s seventeen , but she ’s th ’ last on us . And I do n’t want her to go to th ’ mill , and yet I dunno what she ’s fit for . ”
50147	50151	50038	50038	Margaret	123	“ She could not do”—Margaret
50160	50217	50094	50094	Bessy	204	room—“She could hardly undertake a servant ’s place , could she ? We have an old faithful servant , almost a friend , who wants help , but who is very particular ; and it would not be right to plague her with giving her any assistance that would really be an annoyance and an irritation . ”
50218	50299	50094	50094	Bessy	204	“ No , I see . I reckon yo’re right . Our Mary ’s a good wench ; but who has she had to teach her what to do about a house ? No mother , and me at the mill till I was good for nothing but scolding her for doing badly what I did n’t know how to do a bit . But I wish she could ha ’ lived wi ’ yo ’ , for all that . ”
50300	50397	50094	50094	Bessy	204	“ But even though she may not be exactly fitted to come and live with us as a servant — and I do n’t know about that — I will always try to be a friend to her for your sake , Bessy . And now I must go . I will come again as soon as I can ; but if it should not be to - morrow , or the next day , or even a week or a fortnight hence , do n’t think I ’ve forgotten you . I may be busy . ”
50398	50435	50094	50094	Bessy	204	“ I ’ll know yo ’ wo n’t forget me again . I ’ll not mistrust yo ’ no more . But remember , in a week or a fortnight I may be dead and buried ! ”
50436	50449	50451	50451	Margaret	123	“ I ’ll come again as soon as I can , Bessy , ”
50458	50470	50451	50451	Margaret	123	“ But you ’ll let me know if you get worse . ”
50471	50478	50480	50480	Bessy	204	“ Ay , that will I , ”
50753	50833	50736	50736	He	134	“ Indeed , Margaret , you are growing fanciful ! God knows I should be the first to take the alarm if your mother were really ill ; we always saw when she had her headaches at Helstone , even without her telling us . She looks quite pale and white when she is ill ; and now she has a bright healthy colour in her cheeks , just as she used to have when I first knew her . ”
50834	50838	50840	50840	Margaret	123	“ But papa , ”
50845	50858	50840	50840	Margaret	123	“ do you know I think that is the flush of pain . ”
50859	50910	50736	50736	He	134	“ Nonsense , Margaret . I tell you , you are too fanciful . You are the person not well , I think . Send for the doctor to - morrow for yourself ; and then , if it will make your mind easier , he can see your mother . ”
50911	50926	50928	50928	she	123	“ Thank you , dear papa . It will make me happier , indeed . ”
50983	50987	50989	50989	he	1579	“ Poor Maria ! ”
50994	51039	50989	50989	he	1579	“ I wish one could do right without sacrificing others . I shall hate this town , and myself too , if she——. Pray , Margaret , does your mother often talk to you of the old places : of Helstone , I mean . ”
51040	51045	51047	51047	Margaret	123	“ No , papa , ”
51051	51146	51047	51047	Margaret	123	“ Then , you see , she ca n’t be fretting after them , eh ? It has always been a comfort to me to think that your mother was so simple and open that I knew every little grievance she had . She never would conceal anything seriously affecting her health from me : would she , eh , Margaret ? I am quite sure she would not . So do n’t let me hear of these foolish morbid ideas . Come , give me a kiss , and run off to bed . ”
51194	51255	51256	51256	SOUTHEY	238	“ I was used To sleep at nights as sweetly as a child , — Now if the wind blew rough , it made me start , And think of my poor boy tossing about Upon the roaring seas . And then I seemed To feel that it was hard to take him from me For such a little fault . ”
51454	51633	51449	51449	she	123	“ Oh , Margaret , it was so windy last night ! It came howling down the chimney in our room ! I could not sleep . I never can when there is such a terrible wind . I got into a wakeful habit when poor Frederick was at sea ; and now , even if I do n’t waken all at once , I dream of him in some stormy sea , with great , clear , glass - green walls of waves on either side his ship , but far higher than her very masts , curling over her with that cruel , terrible white foam , like some gigantic crested serpent . It is an old dream , but it always comes back on windy nights , till I am thankful to waken , sitting straight and stiff up in bed with my terror . Poor Frederick ! He is on land now , so wind can do him no harm . Though I did think it might shake down some of those tall chimneys . ”
51634	51665	51825	51825	her	142	“ Where is Frederick now , mamma ? Our letters are directed to the care of Messrs. Barbour , at Cadiz . I know : but where is he himself ? ”
51666	51753	51449	51449	she	123	“ I ca n’t remember the name of the place , but he is not called Hale ; you must remember that , Margaret . Notice the F. D. in every corner of the letters . He has taken the name of Dickenson . I wanted him to have been called Beresford , to which he had a kind of right , but your father thought he had better not . He might be recognised , you know , if he were called by my name . ”
51754	51757	51759	51759	Margaret	123	“ Mamma , ”
51761	51814	51759	51759	Margaret	123	“ I was at Aunt Shaw ’s when it all happened ; and I suppose I was not old enough to be told plainly about it . But I should like to know now , if I may — if it does not give you too much pain to speak about it . ”
51815	51820	51822	51823	Mrs. Hale	142	“ Pain ! No , ”
51829	51917	51918	51918	Margaret	123	“ Yet it is pain to think that perhaps I may never see my darling boy again . Or else he did right , Margaret . They may say what they like , but I have his own letters to show , and I ’ll believe him , though he is my son , sooner than any court - martial on earth . Go to my little japan cabinet , dear , and in the second left - hand drawer you will find a packet of letters . ”
51992	52327	52328	52328	Margaret	123	“ You see , Margaret , how from the very first he disliked Captain Reid . He was second lieutenant in the ship — the Orion — in which Frederick sailed the very first time . Poor little fellow , how well he looked in his midshipman ’s dress , with his dirk in his hand , cutting open all the newspapers with it as if it were a paper - knife ! But this Mr. Reid , as he was then , seemed to take a dislike to Frederick from the very beginning . And then — stay ! these are the letters he wrote on board the Russell . When he was appointed to her , and found his old enemy Captain Reid in command , he did mean to bear all his tyranny patiently . Look ! this is the letter . Just read it , Margaret . Where is it he says — Stop—‘my father may rely upon me , that I will bear with all proper patience everything that one officer and gentleman can take from another . But from my former knowledge of my present captain , I confess I look forward with apprehension to a long course of tyranny on board the Russell . ’ You see , he promises to bear patiently , and I am sure he did , for he was the sweetest - tempered boy , when he was not vexed , that could possibly be . Is that the letter in which he speaks of Captain Reid ’s impatience with the men , for not going through the ship ’s manœuvres as quickly as the Avenger ? You see , he says that they had many new hands on board the Russell , while the Avenger had been nearly three years on the station , with nothing to do but to keep slavers off , and work her men , till they ran up and down the rigging like rats or monkeys . ”
52487	52809	52483	52484	young Hale	123	“ But we did not receive this letter till long , long after we heard of the mutiny . Poor Fred ! I dare say it was a comfort to him to write it , even though he could not have known how to send it , poor fellow ! And then we saw a report in the papers — that ’s to say , long before Fred ’s letter reached us — of an atrocious mutiny having broken out on board the Russell , and that the mutineers had remained in possession of the ship , which had gone off , it was supposed , to be a pirate ; and that Captain Reid was sent adrift in a boat with some men — officers or something — whose names were all given , for they were picked up by a West Indian steamer . Oh , Margaret ! how your father and I turned sick over that list , when there was no name of Frederick Hale . We thought it must be some mistake ; for poor Fred was such a fine fellow , only perhaps rather too passionate ; and we hoped that the name of Carr , which was in the list , was a misprint for that of Hale — newspapers are so careless . And towards post - time the next day , papa set off to walk to Southampton to get the papers ; and I could not stop at home , so I went to meet him . He was very late — much later than I thought he would have been ; and I sat down under the hedge to wait for him . He came at last , his arms hanging loose down , his head sunk , and walking heavily along , as if every step was a labour and a trouble . Margaret , I see him now . ”
52810	52824	52826	52826	Margaret	123	“ Do n’t go on , mamma . I can understand it all , ”
52842	53229	52826	52826	Margaret	123	“ No , you ca n’t , Margaret . No one can who did not see him then . I could hardly lift myself up to go and meet him — everything seemed so to reel around me all at once . And when I got to him , he did not speak , or seem surprised to see me there , more than three miles from home , beside the Oldham beech - tree ; but he put my arm in his , and kept stroking my hand , as if he wanted to soothe me to be very quiet under some great heavy blow ; and when I trembled so all over that I could not speak , he took me in his arms , and stooped down his head on mine , and began to shake and to cry in a strange muffled , groaning voice , till I , for very fright , stood quite still , and only begging him to tell me what he had heard . And then , with his hand jerking , as if some one else moved it against his will , he gave me a wicked newspaper to read , calling our Frederick a ‘ traitor of the blackest dye , ’ ‘ a base , ungrateful disgrace to his profession . ’ Oh ! I can not tell what bad words they did not use . I took the paper in my hands as soon as I had read it — I tore it up to little bits — I tore it — oh ! I believe , Margaret , I tore it with my teeth . I did not cry . I could not . My cheeks were as hot as fire , and my very eyes burnt in my head . I saw your father looking grave at me . I said it was a lie , and so it was . Months after , this letter came , and you see what provocation Frederick had . It was not for himself , or his own injuries , he rebelled ; but he would speak his mind to Captain Reid , and so it went on from bad to worse ; and you see , most of the sailors stuck by Frederick . “
53235	53252	53233	53233	Margaret	123	” she continued , after a pause , in a weak , trembling , exhausted voice , “
53279	53280	53281	53281	I	0	” “
53287	53298	53281	53281	I	0	” said Margaret , in a firm , decided tone . “
53338	53339	53281	53281	I	0	” “
53364	53415	53362	53362	Margaret	123	” Mrs. Hale spoke wistfully , and almost as if apologising for the yearning , craving wish , as though it were a depreciation of her remaining child . But such an idea never crossed Margaret ’s mind . She was thinking how her mother ’s desire could be fulfilled . “
53457	53458	53448	53448	he	245	” “
53465	53470	53448	53448	he	245	” replied Mrs. Hale . “
53525	53558	53499	53499	they	1608	” and for the first time during the conversation Mrs. Hale began to cry ; yet something possessed Margaret to force the information she foresaw , yet dreaded , from her mother . “
53566	53570	53564	53564	mamma	5139	” asked she . “
53580	53587	53564	53564	mamma	5139	” said Mrs. Hale , solemnly . “
53619	53628	53593	53594	the court	1613	” They were silent for a long time . “
53643	53644	53640	53640	he	245	” “
53691	53789	53831	53832	Mrs. Thornton	216	” There was no comfort to be given . Mrs. Hale turned her face to the wall , and lay perfectly still in her mother ’s despair . Nothing could be said to console her . She took her hand out of Margaret ’s with a little impatient movement , as if she would fain be left alone with the recollection of her son . When Mr. Hale came in , Margaret went out , oppressed with gloom , and seeing no promise of brightness on any side of the horizon . CHAPTER XV MASTERS AND MEN . “

53861	53892	53855	53855	I	0	” As they went , Mr. Hale began about his wife ’s health , with a kind of veiled anxiety , which Margaret was glad to see awakened at last . “
53907	53908	53902	53902	you	123	” “
53958	54002	54004	54004	you	528	” She put the truth thus plainly and strongly because her father had so completely shut his mind against the idea , when she had last named her fears . But now the case was changed . He answered in a despondent tone : “
54049	54050	54047	54047	Maria	180	” “
54061	54067	54053	54053	papa	528	” said Margaret , shocked . “
54098	54099	54124	54124	she	186	” “
54108	54109	54102	54102	Dixon	186	” “
54167	54168	54157	54157	you	528	” “
54267	54370	54371	54371	He	1632	” The street did not look as if it could contain any house large enough for Mrs. Thornton ’s habitation . Her son ’s presence never gave any impression as to the kind of house he lived in ; but , unconsciously , Margaret had imagined that tall , massive , handsomely dressed Mrs. Thornton must live in a house of the same character as herself . Now Marlborough Street consisted of long rows of small houses , with a blank wall here and there ; at least that was all they could see from the point at which they entered it . “
54384	54395	54371	54371	He	1632	” said Mr. Hale , with a much perplexed air . “
54427	55378	54420	54420	people	617	” She accordingly inquired of a passer - by , and was informed that Mr. Thornton lived close to the mill , and had the factory lodge - door pointed out to her , at the end of the long dead wall they had noticed . The lodge - door was like a common garden - door ; on one side of it were great closed gates for the ingress and egress of lorries and wagons . The lodge - keeper admitted them into a great oblong yard , on one side of which were offices for the transaction of business ; on the opposite , an immense many - windowed mill , whence proceeded the continual clank of machinery and the long groaning roar of the steam - engine , enough to deafen those who lived within the enclosure . Opposite to the wall , along which the street ran , on one of the narrow sides of the oblong , was a handsome stone - coped house,—blackened , to be sure , by the smoke , but with paint , windows , and steps kept scrupulously clean . It was evidently a house which had been built some fifty or sixty years . The stone facings — the long , narrow windows , and the number of them — the flights of steps up to the front door , ascending from either side , and guarded by railing — all witnessed to its age . Margaret only wondered why people who could afford to live in so good a house , and keep it in such perfect order , did not prefer a much smaller dwelling in the country , or even some suburb ; not in the continual whirl and din of the factory . Her unaccustomed ears could hardly catch her father ’s voice , as they stood on the steps awaiting the opening of the door . The yard , too , with the great doors in the dead wall as a boundary , was but a dismal look - out for the sitting - rooms of the house — as Margaret found when they had mounted the old - fashioned stairs , and been ushered into the drawing - room , the three windows of which went over the front door and the room on the right - hand side of the entrance . There was no one in the drawing - room . It seemed as though no one had been in it since the day when the furniture was bagged up with as much care as if the house was to be overwhelmed with lava , and discovered a thousand years hence . The walls were pink and gold ; the pattern on the carpet represented bunches of flowers on a light ground , but it was carefully covered up in the centre by a linen drugget , glazed and colourless . The window - curtains were lace ; each chair and sofa had its own particular veil of netting or knitting . Great alabaster groups occupied every flat surface , safe from dust under their glass shades . In the middle of the room , right under the bagged - up chandelier , was a large circular table , with smartly - bound books arranged at regular intervals round the circumference of its polished surface , like gaily coloured spokes of a wheel . Everything reflected light , nothing absorbed it . The whole room had a painfully spotted , spangled , speckled look about it , which impressed Margaret so unpleasantly that she was hardly conscious of the peculiar cleanliness required to keep everything so white and pure in such an atmosphere , or of the trouble that must be willingly expended to secure that effect of icy , snowy discomfort . Wherever she looked there was evidence of care and labour , but not care and labour to procure ease , to help on habits of tranquil home employment ; solely to ornament and then to preserve ornament from dirt or destruction . They had leisure to observe , and to speak to each other in low voices , before Mrs. Thornton appeared . They were talking of what all the world might hear ; but it is a common effect of such a room as this to make people speak low , as if unwilling to awaken the unused echoes . At last Mrs. Thornton came in , rustling in handsome black silk , as was her wo nt ; her muslins and laces rivalling , not excelling , the pure whiteness of the muslins and netting of the room . Margaret explained how it was that her mother could not accompany them to return Mrs. Thornton ’s call ; but in her anxiety not to bring back her father ’s fears too vividly , she gave but a bungling account , and left the impression on Mrs. Thornton ’s mind that Mrs. Hale ’s was some temporary or fanciful fine - ladyish indisposition , which might have been put aside had there been a strong enough motive ; or that if it was too severe to allow her to come out that day , the call might have been deferred . Remembering , too , the horses to her carriage , hired for her own visit to the Hales , and how Fanny had been ordered to go by Mr. Thornton , in order to pay every respect to them , Mrs. Thornton drew up slightly offended , and gave Margaret no sympathy — indeed , hardly any credit for the statement of her mother ’s indisposition . “
55384	55389	55381	55382	Mr. Thornton	179	” asked Mr. Hale . “
55404	55405	55399	55399	his	179	” “
55466	55467	55471	55471	they	1637	” “
55478	55483	55471	55471	they	1637	” said Mr. Hale . “
55505	55506	55507	55507	I	0	” “
55606	55614	55603	55603	my	0	” This last clause she gave out with “
55621	55622	55603	55603	my	0	” “
55654	55658	55659	55659	I	0	” said Margaret . “
55751	55752	55715	55717	a Milton manufacturer	5803	” “
55758	55777	55715	55717	a Milton manufacturer	5803	” asked Mr. Hale . Her sallow cheek flushed , and her eye lightened , as she answered : “
55855	55860	55861	55862	Idle gentlemen	1653	” she continued scornfully . “
55889	55988	55989	55989	You	1658	” Both Mr. Hale and Margaret had an uneasy , ludicrous consciousness that they had never heard of this great name , until Mr. Bell had written them word that Mr. Thornton would be a good friend to have in Milton . The proud mother ’s world was not their world of Harley street gentilities on the one hand , or country clergymen and Hampshire squires on the other . Margaret ’s face , in spite of all her endeavours to keep it simply listening in its expression , told the sensitive Mrs. Thornton this feeling of hers . “
56028	56029	56004	56004	You	1658	” “
56032	56040	56004	56004	You	1658	” said Margaret , with some spirit . “
56100	56101	56094	56094	you	1658	” “
56109	56161	56094	56094	you	1658	” asked Mrs. Thornton , a little mollified , yet jealous lest any one else ’s words should not have done him full justice . Margaret hesitated before she replied . She did not like this authoritative questioning . Mr. Hale came in , as he thought , to the rescue . “
56187	56197	56185	56185	Margaret	123	” Mrs. Thornton drew herself up , and said — “
56246	56250	56240	56240	her	5740	” Margaret replied , “
56297	56298	56299	56300	Mr. Bell	178	” “
56355	56356	56348	56348	her	1670	” “
56359	56372	56348	56348	her	1670	” asked Margaret , looking straight at Mrs. Thornton , in bewilderment . “
56411	56504	56505	56505	I	0	” She smiled a grim smile , for she had been pleased by Margaret ’s frankness ; and perhaps she felt that she had been asking questions too much as if she had a right to catechise . Margaret laughed outright at the notion presented to her ; laughed so merrily that it grated on Mrs. Thornton ’s ear , as if the words that called forth that laugh , must have been utterly and entirely ludicrous . Margaret stopped her merriment as soon as she saw Mrs. Thornton ’s annoyed look . “
56534	56535	56536	56537	Young ladies	1677	” “
56543	56550	56536	56537	Young ladies	1677	” said Mrs. Thornton , stiffly . “
56558	56573	56553	56554	Miss Thornton	232	” put in Mr. Hale , desirous of changing the current of the conversation . “
56588	56595	56583	56583	She	232	” replied Mrs. Thornton , shortly . “
56611	56612	56613	56613	I	0	” “
56683	56684	56673	56673	he	179	” “
56688	56692	56673	56673	he	179	” asked Margaret . “
56704	56705	56698	56698	they	1681	” “
56717	56727	56698	56698	they	1681	” said Mrs. Thornton , with a fierce snort . “
56765	56766	56762	56762	they	1681	” “
56776	56781	56767	56767	They	1681	” asked Mr. Hale . “
56909	56910	56887	56887	their	1687	” “
56919	56923	56887	56887	their	1687	” asked Margaret . “
57133	57134	57130	57131	Miss Hale	187	” “
57141	57147	57135	57135	I	0	” said Margaret rather pale . “
57173	57174	57175	57177	South country people	1706	” “
57241	57274	57275	57275	I	0	” Mr. Thornton came that evening to Mr. Hale ’s . He was shown up into the drawing - room , where Mr. Hale was reading aloud to his wife and daughter . “
57312	57313	57309	57310	Dr. Donaldson	253	” “
57317	57406	57315	57315	you	1704	” said Margaret , hastily , holding out her hand to take the note , for she did not wish her mother to hear that they had been making any inquiry about a doctor . She was pleased that Mr. Thornton seemed immediately to understand her feeling ; he gave her the note without another word of explanation . Mr. Hale began to talk about the strike . Mr. Thornton ’s face assumed a likeness to his mother ’s worst expression , which immediately repelled the watching Margaret . “
57676	57677	57667	57667	we	1717	” “
57684	57689	57690	57690	I	0	” asked Mr. Hale . “
57713	57714	57710	57711	Miss Hale	187	” “
57718	57722	57724	57724	you	0	” asked she , “
57757	57758	57754	57754	I	0	” “
57799	57800	57815	57815	your	0	” “
57805	57812	57813	57813	I	0	” said Margaret , very low . “
57826	57827	57823	57823	you	0	” “
57835	57839	57828	57828	I	0	” said she ; “
57854	57855	57846	57846	I	0	” “
57862	57897	57858	57858	you	0	” pleaded he ; his thoughts suddenly bent upon learning what she had said . She was displeased with his pertinacity , but did not choose to affix too much importance to her words . “
57929	57930	57931	57931	I	0	” “
57958	57991	57943	57943	you	0	” He was speaking in a subdued voice , as if to her alone . She did not wish to be so exclusively addressed . She replied out in her usual tone : “
58104	58105	58098	58102	a political economist like you	1725	” “
58112	58117	58098	58102	a political economist like you	1725	” said he eagerly . “
58163	58164	58166	58166	you	0	” “
58168	58174	58166	58166	you	0	” she answered , coldly . “
58208	58209	58210	58210	You	0	” “
58217	58218	58219	58219	I	0	” “
58283	58284	58287	58287	you	0	” “
58329	58339	58323	58323	you	0	” Margaret reddened ; then smiled as she said , “
58428	58429	58430	58430	I	0	” “
58444	58472	58437	58437	Higgins	204	” said Mrs. Hale . Mr. Thornton did not appear to hear what Margaret evidently did not wish him to know . But he caught it nevertheless . “
58520	58574	58499	58500	Captain Lennox	125	” This latter part of her sentence she addressed rather to her father than to Mr. Thornton . Who is Captain Lennox ? asked Mr. Thornton of himself , with a strange kind of displeasure , that prevented him for the moment from replying to her ! Her father took up the conversation . “
58603	58604	58585	58585	you	0	” “
58607	58615	58585	58585	you	0	” she said , with sudden meekness . “
58720	58721	58686	58687	my informant	1752	” “
58752	58788	58789	58789	I	0	” said Mr. Thornton , in an offended tone . Margaret did not reply . She was displeased at the personal character Mr. Thornton affixed to what she had said . Mr. Hale spoke next : “
58847	58900	58839	58839	yourself	187	” Mr. Thornton paused awhile before he spoke . Margaret had just left the room , and he was vexed at the state of feeling between himself and her . However , the little annoyance , by making him cooler and more thoughtful , gave a greater dignity to what he said : “
59005	59006	59007	59007	We	1764	” “
59021	59022	59007	59007	We	1764	” “
59288	59313	59314	59314	I	0	” Margaret had re - entered the room and was sitting at her work ; but she did not speak . Mr. Hale answered — “
59472	59473	59466	59466	you	1783	” “
59477	59481	59466	59466	you	1783	” said Margaret , “
59689	59690	59691	59691	I	0	” “
59953	59954	59955	59955	I	0	” “
60014	60015	60016	60016	I	0	” “
60080	60081	60141	60141	You	0	” “
60084	60092	60141	60141	You	0	” said Margaret in a low voice , “
60106	60140	60141	60141	You	0	” Her father made a sign to her to be silent , and allow Mr. Thornton to finish what he had to say . He was already standing up and preparing to go . “
60205	60206	60200	60200	I	0	” “
60212	60224	60200	60200	I	0	” said Margaret , determined to say just this one thing ; “
60400	60401	60381	60381	he	1820	” “
60419	60467	60411	60411	you	123	” said her father , smiling , yet uneasy at the thought that they were detaining Mr. Thornton against his will , which was a mistake ; for he rather liked it , as long as Margaret would talk , although what she said only irritated him . “
60762	60763	60759	60759	his	1800	” “
60770	60776	60759	60759	his	1800	” said Margaret , laughing . “
60825	60826	60803	60803	he	1800	” “
60846	60852	60843	60844	Miss Hale	187	” said he , hastily . “
60937	60938	60962	60968	a rough , heathenish set of fellows	1848	” “
60943	60950	60962	60968	a rough , heathenish set of fellows	1848	” said Mr. Hale , smiling , “
60976	60977	60978	60978	They	1842	” “
60982	60987	60978	60978	They	1842	” replied Mr. Thornton . “
61024	61025	61015	61015	him	256	” “
61033	61039	61015	61015	him	256	” she said , coldly . “
61061	61068	61069	61069	I	0	” He reddened at her tone . “
61114	61159	61160	61160	I	0	” He did not speak again for a minute , he was too much vexed . But he shook it off , and bade Mr. and Mrs. Hale good night . Then , drawing near to Margaret , he said in a lower voice — “
61193	61194	61189	61189	you	1855	” “
61197	61278	61189	61189	you	1855	” said she , smiling up in his face , the expression of which was somewhat anxious and oppressed , and hardly cleared away as he met her sweet sunny countenance , out of which all the north - wind effect of their discussion had entirely vanished . But she did not put out her hand to him , and again he felt the omission , and set it down to pride . CHAPTER XVI . THE SHADOW OF DEATH . “
61313	61498	61499	61499	My	0	” FROM THE ARABIC . The next afternoon Dr. Donaldson came to pay his first visit to Mrs. Hale . The mystery that Margaret hoped their late habits of intimacy had broken through was resumed . She was excluded from the room , while Dixon was admitted . Margaret was not a ready lover , but where she loved she loved passionately , and with no small degree of jealousy . She went into her mother ’s bed - room , just behind the drawing - room , and paced it up and down , while awaiting the doctor ’s coming out . Every now and then she stopped to listen ; she fancied she heard a moan . She clenched her hands tight , and held her breath . She was sure she heard a moan . Then all was still for a few minutes more ; and then there was the moving of chairs , the raised voices , all the little disturbances of leave - taking . When she heard the door open , she went quickly out of the bedroom . “
61529	61693	61519	61519	I	0	” She saw , and triumphed over all the obstacles which Dixon threw in her way ; assuming her rightful position as daughter of the house in something of the spirit of the Elder Brother , which quelled the old servant ’s officiousness very effectually . Margaret ’s conscious assumption of this unusual dignity of demeanour towards Dixon , gave her an instant ’s amusement in the midst of her anxiety . She knew , from the surprised expression on Dixon ’s face , how ridiculously grand she herself must be looking ; and the idea carried her downstairs into the room ; it gave her that length of oblivion from the keen sharpness of the recollection of the actual business in hand . Now , that came back , and seemed to take away her breath . It was a moment or two before she could utter a word . But she spoke with an air of command , as she asked — “
61711	61727	61701	61701	You	5139	” Then , seeing a slight hesitation on the doctor ’s part , she added — “
61815	61816	61817	61817	My	0	” “
61842	61843	61827	61832	a most attentive and efficient servant	1871	” “
61851	61852	61827	61832	a most attentive and efficient servant	1871	” “
61869	61870	61855	61855	I	0	” “
61905	61906	61890	61890	you	5140	” “
61909	61921	61923	61923	you	5140	” said he , half - smiling , though sadly enough , “
61950	62090	61935	61935	I	0	” He paused . Margaret then went very white , and compressed her lips a little more . Otherwise not a feature moved . With the quick insight into character , without which no medical man can rise to the eminence of Dr. Donaldson , he saw that she would exact the full truth ; that she would know if one iota was withheld ; and that the withholding would be torture more acute than the knowledge of it . He spoke two short sentences in a low voice , watching her all the time ; for the pupils of her eyes dilated into a black horror , and the whiteness of her complexion became livid . He ceased speaking . He waited for that look to go off,—for her gasping breath to come . Then she said : — “
62126	62177	62120	62124	My poor , poor mother	1876	” Her lips now began to quiver , and he let her have the relief of tears , sure of her power of self - control to check them . A few tears — those were all she shed , before she recollected the many questions she longed to ask . “
62184	62190	62120	62124	My poor , poor mother	1876	” He shook his head . “
62222	62223	62224	62225	My father	5535	” “
62227	62235	62224	62225	My father	5535	” said Margaret , trembling all over . “
62459	62475	62479	62479	I	0	” Margaret could not speak for crying ; but she wrang his hand at parting . “
62485	62515	62481	62483	a fine girl	1887	” thought Dr. Donaldson , when he was seated in his carriage , and had time to examine his ringed hand , which had slightly suffered from her pressure . “
62687	62755	62761	62762	my God	1896	” So out he jumped , with thought , wisdom , experience , sympathy , and ready to attend to any of the calls made upon them by this family , just as if there were none other in the world . Meanwhile , Margaret had returned into her father ’s study for a moment , to recover strength before going upstairs into her mother ’s presence . “
62888	62966	62874	62874	I	0	” She ran upstairs . Dixon was not in the room . Mrs. Hale lay back in an easy chair , with a soft white shawl wrapped around her , and a becoming cap put on , in expectation of the doctor ’s visit . Her face had a little faint colour in it , and the very exhaustion after the examination gave it a peaceful look . Margaret was surprised to see her look so calm . “
62981	63012	63013	63013	you	123	” And then , as the idea stole into her mind of what was indeed the real state of the case , she added , as if a little displeased : “
63031	63049	63028	63028	you	123	” Margaret did not reply — only looked wistfully towards her . Mrs. Hale became more displeased . “
63061	63063	63050	63050	He	253	” — “
63083	63128	63078	63078	I	0	” She knelt down by her mother ’s side , and caught her hand — she would not let it go , though Mrs. Hale tried to pull it away . She kept kissing it , and the hot tears she shed bathed it . “
63148	63185	63138	63138	You	123	” But , as if tired with the contest , she left her hand in Margaret ’s clasp , and by - and - by she returned the pressure faintly . That encouraged Margaret to speak . “
63227	63228	63214	63214	I	0	” “
63238	63247	63229	63229	You	123	” said Mrs. Hale , with a shudder . “

63340	63348	63337	63337	Dixon	186	” said Margaret , her lip curling . “
63415	63419	63409	63409	mamma	5139	” implored she . “
63427	63438	63409	63409	mamma	5139	” said Mrs. Hale , anxiously . Margaret recovered herself . “
63517	63518	63520	63520	I	0	” “
63568	63569	63572	63572	mamma	5139	” “

63658	63681	63656	63656	Margaret	123	” said Mrs. Hale , the tears welling up into her eyes . Margaret could not reply . Mrs. Hale went on . “
63716	63717	63711	63711	I	0	” “
63724	63729	63730	63730	He	1924	” said Margaret impatiently . “
63751	63752	63740	63740	mother	445	” “
63772	63819	63821	63821	Frederick	245	” At the mention of that one word , she suddenly cried out loud , as in some sharp agony . It seemed as if the thought of him upset all her composure , destroyed the calm , overcame the exhaustion . Wild passionate cry succeeded to cry—“Frederick
63843	64005	64006	64006	You	1928	” She was in violent hysterics . Margaret went and called Dixon in terror . Dixon came in a huff , and accused Margaret of having over - excited her mother . Margaret bore all meekly , only trusting that her father might not return . In spite of her alarm , which was even greater than the occasion warranted , she obeyed all Dixon ’s directions promptly and well without a word of self - justification . By so doing she mollified her accuser . They put her mother to bed , and Margaret sate by her till she fell asleep , and afterwards till Dixon beckoned her out of the room , and , with a sour face , as if doing something against the grain , she bade her drink a cup of coffee which she had prepared for her in the drawing - room , and stood over her in a commanding attitude as she did so . “
64057	64058	64051	64051	I	0	” “
64063	64069	64061	64061	Dixon	186	” said Margaret , sorrowfully , “
64085	64102	64076	64076	He	528	” And by way of proving how well she bore it , she burst into tears . “
64362	64363	64364	64364	Mamma	163	” “
64373	64374	64370	64371	Poor mamma	1900	” “

64712	64746	64708	64708	I	0	” said Margaret . She hung about Dixon for a minute or so , as if afraid and irresolute ; then , suddenly kissing her , she went quickly out of the room . “
64750	64754	64755	64755	She	1957	” said Dixon . “
64911	64927	64928	64930	Poor young lady	1968	” ( looking out of the window as she heard the front door shut ) . “

65012	65279	64928	64930	Poor young lady	1968	” ANON . Margaret went out heavily and unwillingly enough . But the length of a street — yes , the air of a Milton Street — cheered her young blood before she reached her first turning . Her step grew lighter , her lip redder . She began to take notice , instead of having her thoughts turned so exclusively inward . She saw unusual loiterers in the streets : men with their hands in their pockets sauntering along ; loud - laughing and loud - spoken girls clustered together , apparently excited to high spirits , and a boisterous independence of temper and behaviour . The more ill - looking of the men — the discreditable minority — hung about on the steps of the beer - houses and gin - shops , smoking , and commenting pretty freely on every passer - by . Margaret disliked the prospect of the long walk through these streets , before she came to the fields which she had planned to reach . Instead , she would go and see Bessy Higgins . It would not be so refreshing as a quiet country walk , but still it would perhaps be doing the kinder thing . Nicholas Higgins was sitting by the fire smoking , as she went in . Bessy was rocking herself on the other side . Nicholas took the pipe out of his mouth , and standing up , pushed his chair towards Margaret ; he leant against the chimney - piece in a lounging attitude , while she asked Bessy how she was . “
65323	65324	65327	65327	th	1970	” “
65335	65350	65327	65327	th	1970	” said she , sighing , as if that was answer and explanation enough . “

65639	65652	65597	65598	the people	854	” said he . He had resumed his pipe , and put his “

65665	65670	65597	65598	the people	854	” she went on , “

69170	69241	69154	69154	My	0	” WALLENSTEIN . On Margaret ’s return home she found two letters on the table : one was a note for her mother,—the other , which had come by the post , was evidently from her aunt Shaw — covered with foreign post - marks — thin , silvery , and rustling . She took up the other , and was examining it , when her father came in suddenly : “
69291	69305	69281	69281	Dixon	186	” Margaret hesitated . Her father ’s looks became more grave and anxious : “
69314	69315	69306	69306	He	0	” “
69347	69348	69333	69333	he	0	” “
69374	69375	69370	69370	he	0	” “
69382	69388	69370	69370	he	0	” she replied , gravely . “
69396	69397	69398	69398	Doctors	2110	” “
69408	69488	69398	69398	Doctors	2110	” said he . Margaret saw , in her father ’s nervous ways , that the first impression of possible danger was made upon his mind , in spite of all his making light of what she told him . He could not forget the subject,—could not pass from it to other things ; he kept recurring to it through the evening , with an unwillingness to receive even the slightest unfavourable idea , which made Margaret inexpressibly sad . “
69527	69528	69529	69529	He	528	” “
69540	69541	69538	69538	he	528	” “
69561	69562	69558	69558	I	0	” “
69582	69583	69584	69584	I	0	” “
69590	69599	69584	69584	I	0	” Another pause . Then Margaret went on : “
69615	69622	69603	69603	she	131	” added Margaret , half smiling , “
69650	69651	69647	69647	she	131	” “
69772	69773	69770	69770	Margaret	123	” “
69778	69797	69770	69770	Margaret	123	” said Margaret,—but so sadly , that her father took notice of it . He pinched her cheek . “
69832	69902	69903	69903	She	2124	” But he could not settle to anything that evening . He was continually going backwards and forwards , on laborious tiptoe , to see if his wife was still asleep . Margaret ’s heart ached at his restlessness — his trying to stifle and strangle the hideous fear that was looming out of the dark places of his heart . He came back at last , somewhat comforted . “
69963	70085	69952	69952	I	0	” The note proved to be a formal invitation from Mrs. Thornton , to Mr. , Mrs. , and Miss Hale to dinner , on the twenty - first instant . Margaret was surprised to find an acceptance contemplated , after all she had learnt of sad probabilities during the day . But so it was . The idea of her husband ’s and daughter ’s going to this dinner had quite captivated Mrs. Hale ’s fancy , even before Margaret had heard the contents of the note . It was an event to diversify the monotony of the invalid ’s life ; and she clung to the idea of their going , with even fretful pertinacity , when Margaret objected . “
70128	70149	70152	70152	Margaret	123	” said Mr. Hale , anxiously , as she prepared to write the note of acceptance , the next day . “
70154	70198	70152	70152	Margaret	123	” questioned he , with a nervous motion of his hands . It seemed cruel to refuse him the comfort he craved for . And besides , his passionate refusal to admit the existence of fear , almost inspired Margaret herself with hope . “
70209	70213	70199	70199	I	0	” said she . “
70224	70225	70214	70214	Her	2124	” “

70265	70380	70258	70259	Mr. Donaldson	270	” So he went away to his day ’s duties , now increased by the preparation of some lectures he had promised to deliver to the working people at a neighbouring Lyceum . He had chosen Ecclesiastical Architecture as his subject , rather more in accordance with his own taste and knowledge than as falling in with the character of the place or the desire for particular kinds of information among those to whom he was to lecture . And the institution itself , being in debt , was only too glad to get a gratis course from an educated and accomplished man like Mr. Hale , let the subject be what it might . “
70385	70392	70383	70383	mother	445	” asked Mr. Thornton that night , “

70546	70579	70539	70539	They	2132	” And then he suddenly remembered that , from what Dr. Donaldson had told him , Margaret , at any rate , must be aware of the exact state of the case . “

70700	70740	70741	70741	They	1179	” She did not mean to vex him ; but if she had intended it , she could not have done it more thoroughly . He chafed in silence , however , not deigning to reply to her question . “
70753	70758	70741	70741	They	1179	” said Mrs. Thornton . “
70883	70884	70878	70878	they	2146	” “

70977	71064	71065	71065	Mother	445	” murmured Fanny , protected by her mother . Mr. Thornton heard , but did not care to reply . He was walking up and down the dining - room , wishing that his mother would order candles , and allow him to set to work at either reading or writing , and so put a stop to the conversation . But he never thought of interfering in any of the small domestic regulations that Mrs. Thornton observed , in habitual remembrance of her old economies . “

71093	71106	71083	71083	you	445	” asked she , startled by his earnest , yet tender manner . “

71127	71136	71121	71121	She	187	” said he , with a short laugh . “
71146	71151	71152	71152	She	187	” answered his mother . “

71595	71611	71592	71592	she	187	” said he — and then he paused for a moment — then went on : “

71666	71667	71668	71668	I	0	” “

71748	71757	71724	71724	you	218	” asked Mrs. Thornton , with vivid interest . “

71828	71833	71782	71782	I	0	” said his mother . “

71944	71993	71939	71939	you	0	” Candles had been brought , and Fanny had taken up her interminable piece of worsted - work , over which she was yawning ; throwing herself back in her chair , from time to time to gaze at vacancy , and think of nothing at her ease . “
71996	72000	71939	71939	you	0	” said he , “
72328	72329	72332	72332	you	2184	” “

72436	72437	72425	72425	I	0	” “
72499	72925	72940	72940	I	0	” He kept on with his restless walk — not speaking any more , but drawing a deep breath from time to time , as if endeavouring to throw off some annoying thought . Fanny asked her mother numerous small questions , all having nothing to do with the subject , which a wiser person would have perceived was occupying her attention . Consequently , she received many short answers . She was not sorry when , at ten o’clock , the servants filed in to prayers . These her mother always read,—first reading a chapter . They were now working steadily through the Old Testament . When prayers were ended , and his mother had wished him good - night , with that long steady look of hers which conveyed no expression of the tenderness that was in her heart , but yet had the intensity of a blessing , Mr. Thornton continued his walk . All his business plans had received a check , a sudden pull - up , from this approaching turn - out . The forethought of many anxious hours was thrown away , utterly wasted by their insane folly , which would injure themselves even more than him , though no one could set any limit to the mischief they were doing . And these were the men who thought themselves fitted to direct the masters in the disposal of their capital ; Hamper had said , only this very day , that if he were ruined by the strike , he would start life again , comforted by the conviction that those who had brought it on were in a worse predicament than he himself,—for he had head as well as hands , while they had only hands ; and if they drove away their market , they could not follow it , nor turn to anything else . But this thought was no consolation to Mr. Thornton . It might be that revenge gave him no pleasure ; it might be that he valued the position he had earned with the sweat of his brow , so much that he keenly felt its being endangered by the ignorance or folly of others,—so keenly that he had no thoughts to spare for what would be the consequences of their conduct to themselves . He paced up and down , setting his teeth now and then . At last it struck two . The candles were flickering in their sockets . He lighted his own , muttering to himself : “
73025	73032	73004	73004	he	0	” CHAPTER XIX . ANGEL VISITS . “
73062	73260	73294	73294	mamma	5139	” HENRY VAUGHAN . Mrs. Hale was curiously amused and interested by the idea of the Thornton dinner party . She kept wondering about the details , with something of the simplicity of a little child , who wants to have all its anticipated pleasure described beforehand . But the monotonous life led by invalids often makes them like children , inasmuch as they have neither of them any sense of proportion in events , and seem each to believe that the walls and curtains which shut in their world , and shut out everything else , must of necessity be larger than anything hidden beyond . Besides Mrs. Hale had had her vanities as a girl ; had perhaps unduly felt their mortification when she became a poor clergyman ’s wife;—they had been smothered and kept down ; but they were not extinct ; and she liked to think of seeing Margaret dressed for a party , and discussed what she should wear , with an unsettled anxiety that amused Margaret , who had been more accustomed to society in her one year in Harley Street than her mother in five and twenty years of Helstone . “
73288	73289	73294	73294	mamma	5139	” “
73343	73344	73332	73332	I	0	” “

73455	73468	73447	73447	I	0	” said Mrs. Hale , nervously . Margaret ’s manner changed instantly . “
73492	73493	73484	73484	you	5139	” “
73504	73642	73643	73643	Dear	5155	” So off Margaret went . She was very much inclined to play some pranks when she was dressed up at such an unusual hour ; to make her rich white silk balloon out into a cheese , to retreat backwards from her mother as if she were the queen ; but when she found that these freaks of hers were regarded as interruptions to the serious business , and as such annoyed her mother , she became grave and sedate . What had possessed the world ( her world ) to fidget so about her dress , she could not understand ; but that very afternoon , on naming her engagement to Bessy Higgins ( apropos of the servant that Mrs. Thornton had promised to enquire about ) , Bessy quite roused up at the intelligence . “
73658	73659	73662	73662	Bessy	204	” “
73670	73671	73666	73666	you	5155	” “

73711	73726	73709	73709	Bessy	204	” Bessy ’s cheeks flushed a little at her thought being thus easily read . “
73729	73733	73738	73738	they	2201	” said she , “

73975	74009	73951	73951	I	0	” said Bessy , with an anxious look at Margaret ’s print gown , which her Milton eyes appraised at sevenpence a yard . Margaret ’s face dimpled up into a merry laugh . “

74096	74103	74092	74092	yo	0	” asked Bessy , somewhat relieved . “

74351	74357	74349	74349	Bessy	204	” said Margaret , gently , “

74644	74654	74663	74663	you	204	” Margaret was silent . At last she said , “
74681	74682	74676	74677	your father	5373	” “
74685	74708	74709	74709	He	5373	” said Bessy heavily — in a manner very different from that she had spoken in but a minute or two before . “
74789	74790	74754	74754	Thorntons	288	” “
74796	74800	74801	74801	You	204	” said Margaret . “

74990	75046	75047	75047	Yo’d	204	” Margaret got up , and found some water ; and soaking her pocket - handkerchief in it , she laid the cool wetness on Bessy ’s forehead , and began to chafe the stone - cold feet . Bessy shut her eyes , and allowed herself to be soothed . At last she said , “
75162	75163	75166	75166	they	5321	” “
75174	75178	75179	75179	They	5321	” asked Margaret . “
75183	75187	75179	75179	They	5321	” replied Bessy . “
75335	75352	75356	75356	I	0	” Just then , Nicholas Higgins came in . He caught his daughter ’s last words . “
75440	75496	75434	75434	I	0	” Margaret fancied from his manner that he must have been drinking , not so much from what he said , as from the excited way in which he spoke ; and she was rather confirmed in this idea by the evident anxiety Bessie showed to hasten her departure . Bessy said to her , — “
75528	75539	75540	75540	Thornton	216	” Before Margaret could answer , Higgins broke out , — “
75782	75783	75767	75767	I	0	” “
75788	75794	75767	75767	I	0	” said Margaret , hastily . “
75819	77052	75801	75801	I	0	” The medicines and treatment which Dr. Donaldson had ordered for Mrs. Hale , did her so much good at first that not only she herself , but Margaret , began to hope that he might have been mistaken , and that she could recover permanently . As for Mr. Hale , although he had never had an idea of the serious nature of their apprehensions , he triumphed over their fears with an evident relief , which proved how much his glimpse into the nature of them had affected him . Only Dixon croaked for ever into Margaret ’s ear . However , Margaret defied the raven , and would hope . They needed this gleam of brightness in - doors , for out - of - doors , even to their uninstructed eyes , there was a gloomy brooding appearance of discontent . Mr. Hale had his own acquaintances among the working men , and was depressed with their earnestly - told tales of suffering and long - endurance . They would have scorned to speak of what they had to bear to any one who might , from his position , have understood it without their words . But here was this man , from a distant county , who was perplexed by the workings of a system into the midst of which he was thrown , and each was eager to make him a judge , and to bring witness of his own causes for irritation . Then Mr. Hale brought all his budget of grievances , and laid it before Mr. Thornton , for him , with his experience as a master , to arrange them , and explain their origin ; which he always did , on sound economical principles ; showing that , as trade was conducted , there must always be a waxing and waning of commercial prosperity ; and that in the waning a certain number of masters , as well as of men , must go down into ruin , and be no more seen among the ranks of the happy and prosperous . He spoke as if this consequence were so entirely logical , that neither employers nor employed had any right to complain if it became their fate : the employer to turn aside from the race he could no longer run , with a bitter sense of incompetency and failure — wounded in the struggle — trampled down by his fellows in their haste to get rich — slighted where he was once honoured — humbly asking for , instead of bestowing , employment with a lordly hand . Of course , speaking so of the fate that , as a master , might be his own in the fluctuations of commerce , he was not likely to have more sympathy with that of the workmen , who were passed by in the swift merciless improvement or alteration ; who would fain lie down and quietly die out of the world that needed them not , but felt as they could never rest in their graves for the clinging cries of the beloved and helpless they would leave behind ; who envied the power of the wild bird , that can feed her young with her very heart ’s blood . Margaret ’s whole soul rose up against him while he reasoned in this way — as if commerce were everything and humanity nothing . She could hardly thank him for the individual kindness , which brought him that very evening to offer her — for the delicacy which made him understand that he must offer her privately — every convenience for illness that his own wealth or his mother ’s foresight had caused them to accumulate in their household , and which , as he learnt from Dr. Donaldson , Mrs. Hale might possibly require . His presence , after the way he had spoken — his bringing before her the doom , which she was vainly trying to persuade herself might yet be averted from her mother — all conspired to set Margaret ’s teeth on edge , as she looked at him , and listened to him . What business had he to be the only person , except Dr. Donaldson and Dixon , admitted to the awful secret , which she held shut up in the most dark and sacred recess of her heart — not daring to look at it , unless she invoked heavenly strength to bear the sight — that , some day soon , she should cry aloud for her mother , and no answer would come out of the blank , dumb darkness ? Yet he knew all . She saw it in his pitying eyes . She heard it in his grave and tremulous voice . How reconcile those eyes , that voice , with the hard , reasoning , dry , merciless way in which he laid down axioms of trade , and serenely followed them out to their full consequences ? The discord jarred upon her inexpressibly . The more because of the gathering woe of which she heard from Bessy . To be sure , Nicholas Higgins , the father , spoke differently . He had been appointed a committee - man , and said that he knew secrets of which the exoteric knew nothing . He said this more expressly and particularly , on the very day before Mrs. Thornton ’s dinner - party . When Margaret , going in to speak to Bessy , found him arguing the point with Boucher , the neighbour of whom she had frequently heard mention , as by turns exciting Higgins ’s compassion , as an unskilful workman with a large family depending upon him for support , and at other times enraging his more energetic and sanguine neighbour by his want of what the latter called spirit . It was very evident that Higgins was in a passion when Margaret entered . Boucher stood , with both hands on the rather high mantelpiece , swaying himself a little on the support which his arms , thus placed , gave him , and looking wildly into the fire , with a kind of despair that irritated Higgins , even while it went to his heart . Bessy was rocking herself violently backwards and forwards , as was her wo nt ( Margaret knew by this time ) when she was agitated . Her sister Mary was tying on her bonnet ( in great clumsy bows , as suited her great clumsy fingers ) , to go to her fustian - cutting , blubbering out loud the while , and evidently longing to be away from a scene that distressed her . Margaret came in upon this scene . She stood for a moment at the door — then , her finger on her lips , she stole to a seat on the squab near Bessy . Nicholas saw her come in , and greeted her with a gruff , but not unfriendly nod . Mary hurried out of the house , catching gladly at the open door , and crying aloud when she got away from her father ’s presence . It was only John Boucher that took no notice whatever who came in and who went out . “
77437	77468	77433	77433	he	292	” Here the deep sobs choked the poor man and Nicholas looked up , with eyes brimful of tears , to Margaret , before he could gain courage to speak . “
77535	77553	77554	77554	I	0	” continued he , as he fumbled in a tea - pot for what money he had . “
77647	77681	77682	77682	Yo	2299	” The man turned round at these words,—turned round a face so white , and gaunt , and tear - furrowed , and hopeless , that its very calm forced Margaret to weep . “
77770	77793	77796	77796	me	0	” Nicholas had his hand on the lock of the door — he stopped and turned round on Boucher , close following : “
77898	77939	77945	77945	father	5264	” Not one word had Margaret or Bessy spoken . They had hardly uttered the sighing , that the eyes of each called to the other to bring up from the depths of her heart . At last Bessy said , “
77965	77966	77955	77955	him	5264	” “
77969	77973	77955	77955	him	5264	” said Margaret . “
78016	78041	78042	78042	My	0	” Bessy lay back without taking any notice of what Margaret said . She did not cry — she only quivered up her breath . “
78051	78055	78042	78042	My	0	” she said . “
78289	78365	78367	78367	yo	2331	” Margaret sat utterly silent . How was she ever to go away into comfort and forget that man ’s voice , with the tone of unutterable agony , telling more by far than his words of what he had to suffer ? She took out her purse ; she had not much in it of what she could call her own , but what she had she put into Bessy ’s hands without speaking . “
78470	78508	78465	78465	I	0	” Bessy seemed almost afraid lest Margaret should think they had not the will , and , to a certain degree , the power of helping one whom she evidently regarded as having a claim upon them . “
78511	78516	78465	78465	I	0	” she went on , “
78574	78605	78548	78548	yo	2331	” Bessy seemed much quieter to - day , but fearfully languid and exhausted . As she finished speaking , she looked so faint and weary that Margaret became alarmed . “
78610	78614	78548	78548	yo	2331	” said Bessy . “
78721	78729	78730	78732	Old and young	2344	” CHAPTER XX . MEN AND GENTLEMEN . “
78760	78838	78756	78756	I	0	” ROLLO , DUKE OF NORMANDY . Margaret went home so painfully occupied with what she had heard and seen that she hardly knew how to rouse herself up to the duties which awaited her ; the necessity for keeping up a constant flow of cheerful conversation for her mother , who , now that she was unable to go out , always looked to Margaret ’s return from the shortest walk as bringing in some news . “
78852	78853	78854	78854	She	2347	” “
78865	78871	78872	78872	Dear	5155	” said Margaret , dolefully . “
78882	78903	78879	78879	I	0	” said Mrs. Hale , with a little of the jealousy which one invalid is apt to feel of another . “
78921	78938	78947	78947	you	5655	” ( Her kindly nature prevailing , and the old Helstone habits of thought returning . ) “
78982	78983	78986	78986	mamma	5139	” “
79090	79236	79258	79258	he	179	” exclaimed Margaret , bursting the bounds she had preordained for herself before she came in , and telling her mother what she had seen and heard at Higgins ’s cottage . It distressed Mrs. Hale excessively . It made her restlessly irritated till she could do something . She directed Margaret to pack up a basket in the very drawing - room , to be sent there and then to the family ; and was almost angry with her for saying , that it would not signify if it did not go till morning , as she knew Higgins had provided for their immediate wants , and she herself had left money with Bessy . Mrs. Hale called her unfeeling for saying this ; and never gave herself breathing - time till the basket was sent out of the house . Then she said : “
79294	79686	79291	79291	he	2359	” The question was referred to Mr. Hale by his wife , when he came upstairs , fresh from giving a lesson to Mr. Thornton , which had ended in conversation , as was their wo nt . Margaret did not care if their gifts had prolonged the strife ; she did not think far enough for that , in her present excited state . Mr. Hale listened , and tried to be as calm as a judge ; he recalled all that had seemed so clear not half - an - hour before , as it came out of Mr. Thornton ’s lips ; and then he made an unsatisfactory compromise . His wife and daughter had not only done quite right in this instance , but he did not see for a moment how they could have done otherwise . Nevertheless , as a general rule , it was very true what Mr. Thornton said , that as the strike , if prolonged , must end in the masters bringing hands from a distance ( if , indeed , the final result were not , as it had often been before , the invention of some machine which would diminish the need of hands at all ) , why , it was clear enough that the kindest thing was to refuse all help which might bolster them up in their folly . But as to this Boucher , he would go and see him the first thing in the morning , and try and find out what could be done for him . Mr. Hale went the next morning , as he proposed . He did not find Boucher at home , but he had a long talk with his wife ; promised to ask for an Infirmary order for her ; and , seeing the plenty provided by Mrs. Hale , and somewhat lavishly used by the children , who were masters downstairs in their father ’s absence , he came back with a more consoling and cheerful account than Margaret had dared to hope for ; indeed , what she had said the night before had prepared her father for so much worse a state of things that , by a re - action of his imagination , he described all as better than it really was . “
79699	79704	79695	79696	the man	1353	” said Mr. Hale . “
79784	79921	79922	79923	Miss Hale	187	” Bessy , too , was rather better this day . Still she was so weak that she seemed to have entirely forgotten her wish to see Margaret dressed — if , indeed , that had not been the feverish desire of a half delirious state . Margaret could not help comparing this strange dressing of hers , to go where she did not care to be — her heart heavy with various anxieties — with the old , merry , girlish toilettes that she and Edith had performed scarcely more than a year ago . Her only pleasure now in decking herself out was in thinking that her mother would take delight in seeing her dressed . She blushed when Dixon , throwing the drawing - room door open , made an appeal for admiration . “
79964	80070	79954	79955	Miss Margaret	123	” Margaret ’s black hair was too thick to be plaited ; it needed rather to be twisted round and round , and have its fine silkiness compressed into massive coils , that encircled her head like a crown , and then were gathered into a large spiral knot behind . She kept its weight together by two large coral pins , like small arrows for length . Her white silk sleeves were looped up with strings of the same material , and on her neck , just below the base of her curved and milk - white throat , there lay heavy coral beads . “
80100	80129	80093	80094	Lady Beresford	156	” Margaret kissed her mother for this little burst of maternal vanity ; but she could hardly smile at it , she felt so much out of spirits . “
80142	80143	80140	80140	mamma	5139	” “
80184	80542	80543	80543	My	0	” Mrs. Hale would have been more than interested,—she would have been astonished , if she had seen the sumptuousness of the dinner - table and its appointments . Margaret , with her London cultivated taste , felt the number of delicacies to be oppressive ; one half of the quantity would have been enough , and the effect tighter and more elegant . But it was one of Mrs. Thornton ’s rigorous laws of hospitality , that of each separate dainty enough should be provided for all the guests to partake , if they felt inclined . Careless to abstemiousness in her daily habits , it was part of her pride to set a feast before such of her guests as cared for it . Her son shared this feeling . He had never known — though he might have imagined , and had the capability to relish — any kind of society but that which depended on an exchange of superb meals : and even now , though he was denying himself the personal expenditure of an unnecessary sixpence , and had more than once regretted that the invitations for this dinner had been sent out , still , as it was to be , he was glad to see the old magnificence of preparation . Margaret and her father were the first to arrive . Mr. Hale was anxiously punctual to the time specified . There was no one upstairs in the drawing - room but Mrs. Thornton and Fanny . Every cover was taken off , and the apartment blazed forth in yellow silk damask and a brilliantly flowered carpet . Every corner seemed filled up with ornament , until it became a weariness to the eye , and presented a strange contrast to the bald ugliness of the look - out into the great mill - yard , where wide folding gates were thrown open for the admission of carriages . The mill loomed high on the left - hand side of the windows , casting a shadow down from its many stories , which darkened the summer evening before its time . “
80573	80594	80565	80565	I	0	” Mr. Hale was standing at one of the windows as Mrs. Thornton spoke . He turned away , saying , “
80610	80616	80597	80597	you	0	” She drew herself up : “
80662	80663	80664	80664	I	0	” “
80688	80689	80690	80690	I	0	” “
80698	80702	80695	80696	Mr. Hale	134	” said Fanny . “
80721	80722	80723	80723	I	0	” “
80883	82246	82247	82247	I	0	” The expression on her face , always stern , deepened into dark anger , as she said this . Nor did it clear away when Mr. Thornton entered the room ; for she saw in an instant , the weight of care and anxiety which he could not shake off , although his guests received from him a greeting that appeared both cheerful and cordial . He shook hands with Margaret . He knew it was the first time their hands had met , though she was perfectly unconscious of the fact . He inquired after Mrs. Hale , and heard Mr. Hale ’s sanguine , hopeful account ; and , glancing to Margaret , to understand how far she agreed with her father , he saw that no dissenting shadow crossed her face . And as he looked with this intention , he was struck anew with her great beauty . He had never seen her in such dress before ; and yet now it appeared that such elegance of attire was so befitting her noble figure and lofty serenity of countenance that she ought to go always thus apparelled . She was talking to Fanny ; about what he could not hear ; but he saw his sister ’s restless way of continually arranging some part of her gown , her wandering eyes , now glancing here , now there , but without any purpose in her observation ; and he contrasted them uneasily with the large soft eyes that looked forth steadily at one object , as if from out their light beamed some gentle influence of repose : the curving lines of the red lips , just parted in the interest of listening to what her companion said — the head a little bent forwards , so as to make a long sweeping line from the summit , where the light caught on the glossy raven hair , to the smooth ivory tip of the shoulder ; the round white arms , and taper hands , laid lightly across each other , but perfectly motionless in their pretty attitude . Mr. Thornton sighed as he took in all this with one of his sudden comprehensive glances . And then he turned his back to the young ladies , and threw himself , with an effort , but with all his heart and soul , into a conversation with Mr. Hale . More people came — more and more . Fanny left Margaret ’s side and helped her mother to receive her guests . Mr. Thornton felt that in this influx no one was speaking to Margaret , and was restless under this apparent neglect . But he never went near her himself ; he did not look at her . Only , he knew what she was doing — or not doing — better than he knew the movements of any one else in the room . Margaret was so unconscious of herself , and so much amused by watching other people , that she never thought whether she was left unnoticed or not . Somebody took her down to dinner ; she did not catch the name ; nor did he seem much inclined to talk to her . There was a very animated conversation going on among the gentlemen ; the ladies , for the most part , were silent , employing themselves in taking notes of the dinner and criticising each other ’s dresses . Margaret caught the clue to the general conversation , grew interested and listened attentively . Mr. Horsfall , the stranger , whose visit to the town was the original germ of the party , was asking questions relative to the trade and manufactures of the place ; and the rest of the gentlemen — all Milton men — were giving him answers and explanations . Some dispute arose , which was warmly contested ; it was referred to Mr. Thornton , who had hardly spoken before ; but who now gave an opinion , the grounds of which were so clearly stated that even the opponents yielded . Margaret ’s attention was thus called to her host ; his whole manner , as master of the house , and entertainer of his friends , was so straightforward , yet simple and modest , as to be thoroughly dignified . Margaret thought she had never seen him to so much advantage . When he had come to their house , there had been always something , either of over - eagerness or of that kind of vexed annoyance which seemed ready to pre - suppose that he was unjustly judged , and yet felt too proud to try and make himself better understood . But now , among his fellows , there was no uncertainty as to his position . He was regarded by them as a man of great force of character ; of power in many ways . There was no need to struggle for their respect . He had it , and he knew it ; and the security of this gave a fine grand quietness to his voice and ways , which Margaret had missed before . He was not in the habit of talking to ladies ; and what he did say was a little formal . To Margaret herself he hardly spoke at all . She was surprised to think how much she enjoyed this dinner . She knew enough now to understand many local interests — nay , even some of the technical words employed by the eager millowners . She silently took a very decided part in the question they were discussing . At any rate , they talked in desperate earnest,—not in the used - up style that wearied her so in the old London parties . She wondered that , with all this dwelling on the manufacturers and trade of the place , no allusion was made to the strike then pending . She did not yet know how coolly such things were taken by the masters , as having only one possible end . To be sure , the men were cutting their own throats , as they had done many a time before ; but if they would be fools , and put themselves into the hands of a rascally set of paid delegates , they must take the consequence . One or two thought Thornton looked out of spirits ; and , of course , he must lose by this turn - out . But it was an accident that might happen to themselves any day ; and Thornton was as good to manage a strike as any one ; for he was as iron a chap as any in Milton . The hands had mistaken their man in trying that dodge on him . And they chuckled inwardly at the idea of the workmen ’s discomfiture and defeat , in their attempt to alter one iota of what Thornton had decreed . It was rather dull for Margaret after dinner . She was glad when the gentlemen came , not merely because she caught her father ’s eye to brighten her sleepiness up ; but because she could listen to something larger and grander than the petty interests which the ladies had been talking about . She liked the exultation in the sense of power which these Milton men had . It might be rather rampant in its display , and savour of boasting ; but still they seemed to defy the old limits of possibility , in a kind of fine intoxication , caused by the recollection of what had been achieved , and what yet should be . If in her cooler moments she might not approve of the spirit in all things , still there was much to admire in their forgetfulness of themselves and the present , in their anticipated triumphs over all inanimate matter at some future time which none of them would live to see . She was rather startled when Mr. Thornton spoke to her close at her elbow : “
82266	82267	82260	82260	you	2391	” “
82324	82325	82322	82322	he	276	” “
82386	82387	82392	82392	gentleman	6058	” “
82401	82402	82397	82398	true man	2399	” “
82433	82434	82418	82419	A man	940	” “
82440	82444	82437	82437	you	2391	” asked Margaret . “
82452	82453	82437	82437	you	2391	” “
82629	82717	82615	82615	I	0	” Margaret thought a moment — but before she could speak her slow conviction , he was called away by some of the eager manufacturers , whose speeches she could not hear , though she could guess at their import by the short clear answers Mr. Thornton gave , which came steady and firm as the boom of a distant minute gun . They were evidently talking of the turn - out , and suggesting what course had best be pursued . She heard Mr. Thornton say : “
82723	82737	82615	82615	I	0	” Then came a hurried murmur , in which two or three joined . “
82745	82791	82792	82792	I	0	” Some doubts were implied , some difficulties named by Mr. Slickson , who took hold of Mr. Thornton ’s arm , the better to impress his words . Mr. Thornton moved slightly away , lifted his eyebrows a very little , and then replied : “
82807	82815	82816	82816	I	0	” Still some more fears were urged . “
82875	82924	82925	82927	A Milton lady	2417	” Mr. Horsfall took him a little on one side , as Margaret conjectured , to ask him some other question about the strike ; but , in truth , it was to inquire who she herself was — so quiet , so stately , and so beautiful . “
82929	82939	82925	82927	A Milton lady	2417	” asked he , as the name was given . “
82953	82971	82950	82950	I	0	” was the cold , indifferent answer . Mrs. Slickson was catechising Fanny on the same subject . “
82988	82989	82984	82985	Mr. Horsfall	276	” “
83068	83069	83070	83071	Mr. Thornton	179	” “
83099	83137	83182	83191	none The smile that is not sister to a tear	2429	” Fanny was not sure , from Mrs. Slickson ’s manner , whether she ought to be proud or ashamed of her brother ’s conduct ; and , like all people who try and take other people ’s “
83139	83176	83182	83191	none The smile that is not sister to a tear	2429	” for the rule of their feelings , she was inclined to blush for any singularity of action . Her shame was interrupted by the dispersion of the guests . CHAPTER XXI . THE DARK NIGHT . “
83193	83233	83237	83237	her	2430	” ELLIOTT . Margaret and her father walked home . The night was fine , the streets clean , and with her pretty white silk , like Leezie Lindsay ’s gown o ’ green satin , in the ballad , “
83240	83263	83237	83237	her	2430	” she was off with her father — ready to dance along with the excitement of the cool , fresh night air . “
83287	83288	83279	83279	He	179	” “
83320	83321	83323	83323	he	179	” “
83354	83355	83347	83347	his	179	” “
83466	83467	83462	83463	Mr. Thornton	179	” “
83545	83546	83549	83549	papa	528	” “
83551	83552	83549	83549	papa	528	” “
83606	83607	83604	83604	Margaret	123	” “
83656	83657	83636	83642	a man of great strength of character	2444	” “
83746	83747	83744	83744	Margaret	123	” “
83934	83935	83938	83938	you	528	” “
83943	83948	83951	83951	they	473	” asked Mr. Hale . “
84004	84005	83987	83987	her	232	” “
84031	84032	84027	84028	Mrs. Thornton	216	” “
84096	84097	84084	84084	They	473	” “
84114	84144	84105	84105	you	2459	” said Mr. Hale , quietly smiling . But smiles were changed to white and trembling looks when they saw Dixon ’s face , as she opened the door . “
84198	84261	84190	84190	she	2465	” Mr. Hale caught Margaret ’s arm to steady himself from falling . He looked at her face , and saw an expression upon it of surprise and extremest sorrow , but not the agony of terror that contracted his own unprepared heart . She knew more than he did , and yet she listened with that hopeless expression of awed apprehension . “
84277	84301	84302	84302	She	2465	” moaned forth Margaret , as she supported her trembling father ’s hasty steps upstairs . Dr. Donaldson met them on the landing . “
84307	84311	84302	84302	She	2465	” he whispered . “
84338	84339	84332	84332	she	2465	” “
84349	84542	84545	84545	him	2470	” Half an hour ago Mr. Hale was a middle - aged man ; now his sight was dim , his senses wavering , his walk tottering , as if he were seventy years of age . Dr. Donaldson took his arm , and led him into the bedroom . Margaret followed close . There lay her mother , with an unmistakeable look on her face . She might be better now ; she was sleeping , but Death had signed her for his own , and it was clear that ere long he would return to take possession . Mr. Hale looked at her for some time without a word . Then he began to shake all over , and , turning away from Dr. Donaldson ’s anxious care , he groped to find the door ; he could not see it , although several candles , brought in the sudden affright , were burning and flaring there . He staggered into the drawing - room , and felt about for a chair . Dr. Donaldson wheeled one to him , and placed him in it . He felt his pulse . “
84555	84556	84557	84557	Papa	139	” “
84559	84573	84574	84574	Papa	139	” said Margaret , with a crying voice that was wild with pain . “
84580	84596	84597	84597	Margaret	123	” The speculation came again into his eyes , and he made a great effort . “
84613	84614	84611	84611	you	123	” “
84624	84633	84634	84635	Miss Hale	187	” replied Dr. Donaldson , with quick decision . “
84723	84724	84688	84688	She	2473	” “
84730	84772	84688	84688	She	2473	” Dr. Donaldson glanced at Margaret . Her bent head , her face raised with no appeal for a temporary reprieve , showed that quick observer of human nature that she thought it better that the whole truth should be told . “
84835	84848	84849	84849	You	5140	” But all the reply he got was in the choked words , “
84866	84932	84855	84856	Dr. Donaldson	253	” and in the deep , manly sobs , which went through the stillness of the night like heavy pulses of agony . Margaret knelt by him , caressing him with tearful caresses . No one , not even Dr. Donaldson , knew how the time went by . Mr. Hale was the first to dare to speak of the necessities of the present moment . “
84938	84942	84855	84856	Dr. Donaldson	253	” asked he . “
84956	85139	84947	84947	Margaret	123	” Dr. Donaldson gave his clear , sensible directions . No fear for to - night — nay , even peace for to - morrow , and for many days yet . But no enduring hope of recovery . He advised Mr. Hale to go to bed , and leave only one to watch the slumber , which he hoped would be undisturbed . He promised to come again early in the morning . And , with a warm and kindly shake of the hand , he left them . They spoke but few words ; they were too much exhausted by their terror to do more than decide upon the immediate course of action . Mr. Hale was resolved to sit up through the night , and all that Margaret could do was to prevail upon him to rest on the drawing - room sofa . Dixon stoutly and bluntly refused to go to bed ; and , as for Margaret , it was simply impossible that she should leave her mother , let all the doctors in the world speak of “
85143	85145	85146	85147	one watcher	2478	” and “
85152	85602	85146	85147	one watcher	2478	” So , Dixon sat , and stared , and winked , and drooped , and picked herself up again with a jerk , and finally gave up the battle , and fairly snored . Margaret had taken off her gown and tossed it aside with a sort of impatient disgust , and put on her dressing - gown . She felt as if she never could sleep again ; as if her whole senses were acutely vital , and all endued with double keenness , for the purpose of watching . Every sight and sound — nay , even every thought , touched some nerve to the very quick . For more than two hours , she heard her father ’s restless movements in the next room . He came perpetually to the door of her mother ’s chamber , pausing there to listen , till she , not hearing his close unseen presence , went and opened it to tell him how all went on , in reply to the questions his baked lips could hardly form . At last he , too , fell asleep , and all the house was still . Margaret sat behind the curtain thinking . Far away in time , far away in space , seemed all the interests of past days . Not more than thirty - six hours ago , she cared for Bessy Higgins and her father , and her heart was wrung for Boucher ; now , that was all like a dreaming memory of some former life;—everything that had passed out of doors seemed dissevered from her mother , and therefore unreal . Even Harley Street appeared more distinct ; there she remembered , as if it were yesterday , how she had pleased herself with tracing out her mother ’s features in her Aunt Shaw ’s face,—and how letters had come , making her dwell on the thoughts of home with all the longing of love . Helstone , itself , was in the dim past . The dull gray days of the preceding winter and spring , so uneventless and monotonous , seemed more associated with what she cared for now above all price . She would fain have caught at the skirts of that departing time , and prayed it to return , and give her back what she had too little valued while it was yet in her possession . What a vain show Life seemed ! How unsubstantial , and flickering , and flitting ! It was as if from some aërial belfry , high up above the stir and jar of the earth , there was a bell continually tolling , “
85611	85779	85834	85834	I	0	” And when the morning dawned , cool and gray , like many a happier morning before — when Margaret looked one by one at the sleepers , it seemed as if the terrible night were unreal as a dream ; it , too , was a shadow . It , too , was past . Mrs. Hale herself was not aware when she awoke , how ill she had been the night before . She was rather surprised at Dr. Donaldson ’s early visit , and perplexed by the anxious faces of husband and child . She consented to remain in bed that day , saying she certainly was tired ; but , the next , she insisted on getting up ; and Dr. Donaldson gave his consent to her returning into the drawing - room . She was restless and uncomfortable in every position , and before night she became very feverish . Mr. Hale was utterly listless , and incapable of deciding on anything . “
85791	85799	85834	85834	I	0	” asked Margaret on the third day . “
85911	85931	85932	85932	I	0	” said he , his eye catching on Margaret ’s face , blanched with watching in a sick room , “
85974	85975	85969	85969	she	216	” “
85978	85982	85969	85969	she	216	” said Margaret . “
86004	86657	85996	85997	Mrs. Thornton	216	” Dr. Donaldson ’s experience told him rightly . Mrs. Hale seemed to shake off the consequences of her attack , and looked brighter and better this afternoon than Margaret had ever hoped to see her again . Her daughter left her after dinner , sitting in her easy chair , with her hand lying in her husband ’s , who looked more worn and suffering than she by far . Still , he could smile now — rather slowly , rather faintly , it is true ; but a day or two before , Margaret never thought to see him smile again . It was about two miles from their house in Crampton Crescent to Marlborough Street . It was too hot to walk very quickly . An August sun beat straight down into the street at three o’clock in the afternoon . Margaret went along , without noticing anything very different from usual in the first mile and a half of her journey ; she was absorbed in her own thoughts , and had learnt by this time to thread her way through the irregular stream of human beings that flowed through Milton streets . But , by and by , she was struck with an unusual heaving among the mass of people in the crowded road on which she was entering . They did not appear to be moving on , so much as talking , and listening , and buzzing with excitement without much stirring from the spot where they might happen to be . Still , as they made way for her , and , wrapt up in the purpose of her errand , and the necessities that suggested it , she was less quick of observation than she might have been , if her mind had been at ease . She had got into Marlborough Street before the full conviction forced itself upon her , that there was a restless , oppressive sense of irritation abroad among the people ; a thunderous atmosphere , morally as well as physically , around her . From every narrow lane opening out on Marlborough Street came up a low distant roar , as of myriads of fierce indignant voices . The inhabitants of each poor squalid dwelling were gathered round the doors and windows , if indeed they were not actually standing in the middle of the narrow ways — all with looks intent towards one point . Marlborough Street itself was the focus of all those human eyes , that betrayed intensest interest of various kinds ; some fierce with anger , some lowering with relentless threats ! some dilated with fear , or imploring entreaty ; and as Margaret reached the small side - entrance by the folding doors , in the great dead wall of Marlborough mill - yard , and waited the porter ’s answer to the bell , she looked round and heard the first long far - off roll of the tempest;—saw the first slow - surging wave of the dark crowd come , with its threatening crest , tumble over , and retreat , at the far end of the street , which a moment ago seemed so full of repressed noise , but which now was ominously still ; all these circumstances forced themselves on Margaret ’s notice , but did not sink down into her pre - occupied heart . She did not know what they meant — what was their deep significance ; while she did know , did feel the keen sharp pressure of the knife that was soon to stab her through and through by leaving her motherless . She was trying to realise that , in order that , when it came , she might be ready to comfort her father . The porter opened the door cautiously , not nearly wide enough to admit her . “
86667	86699	86660	86660	you	2486	” said he , drawing a long breath , and widening the entrance , but still not opening it fully . Margaret went in . He hastily bolted it behind her . “
86712	86716	86709	86709	I	0	” asked he . “
86738	86802	86735	86735	I	0	” She went across the yard and put up the steps to the house door . There was no near sound,—no steam engine at work with beat and pant,—no click of machinery , no mingling and clashing of many sharp voices ; but far away , the ominous gathering roar , deep - clamouring . CHAPTER XXII . A BLOW AND ITS CONSEQUENCES . “
86834	86972	86973	86973	Mamma	163	” CORN LAW RHYMES . Margaret was shown into the drawing - room . It had returned into its normal state of bag and covering . The windows were half open because of the heat , and the Venetian blinds covered the glass,—so that a gray grim light , reflected from the pavement below , threw all the shadows wrong , and combined with the green - tinged upper light to make even Margaret ’s own face , as she caught it in the mirrors , look ghastly and wan . She sat and waited ; no one came . Every now and then , the wind seemed to bear the distant multitudinous sound nearer ; and yet there was no wind ! It died away into profound stillness between whiles . Fanny came in at last . “
87126	87249	87124	87124	mamma	5139	” Mrs. Thornton came in with a look of black sternness on her face , which made Margaret feel she had arrived at a bad time to trouble her with her request . However , it was only in compliance with Mrs. Thornton ’s expressed desire , that she would ask for whatever they might want in the progress of her mother ’s illness . Mrs. Thornton ’s brow contracted , and her mouth grew set , while Margaret spoke with gentle modesty of her mother ’s restlessness , and Dr. Donaldson ’s wish that she should have the relief of a water - bed . She ceased . Mrs. Thornton did not reply immediately . Then she started up and exclaimed — “
87284	87710	87279	87279	John	262	” And simultaneously , the gathering tramp — to which she had been listening , instead of heeding Margaret ’s words — was heard just right outside the wall , and an increasing din of angry voices raged behind the wooden barrier , which shook as if the unseen maddened crowd made battering rams of their bodies , and retreated a short space only to come with more united steady impetus against it , till their great beats made the strong gates quiver , like reeds before the wind . The women gathered round the windows , fascinated to look on the scene which terrified them . Mrs. Thornton , the women - servants , Margaret,—all were there . Fanny had returned , screaming upstairs as if pursued at every step , and had thrown herself in hysterical sobbing on the sofa . Mrs. Thornton watched for her son , who was still in the mill . He came out , looked up at them — the pale cluster of faces — and smiled good courage to them , before he locked the factory door . Then he called to one of the women to come down and undo his own door , which Fanny had fastened behind her in her mad flight . Mrs. Thornton herself went . And the sound of his well - known and commanding voice , seemed to have been like the taste of blood to the infuriated multitude outside . Hitherto they had been voiceless , wordless , needing all their breath for their hard - laboured efforts to break down the gates . But now , hearing him speak inside , they set up such a fierce , unearthly groan , that even Mrs. Thornton was white with fear as she preceded him into the room . He came in a little flushed , but his eyes gleamed , as in answer to the trumpet - call of danger , and with a proud look of defiance on his face , that made him a noble , if not a handsome man . Margaret had always dreaded lest her courage should fail her in any emergency , and she should be proved to be , what she dreaded lest she was — a coward . But now , in this real great time of reasonable fear and nearness of terror , she forgot herself , and felt only an intense sympathy — intense to painfulness — in the interests of the moment . Mr. Thornton came frankly forwards : “
87794	87813	87792	87792	Jane	306	” continued he , addressing the upper - servant . And she went , followed by the others . “
87818	87823	87792	87792	Jane	306	” said his mother . “
87832	87943	87792	87792	Jane	306	” And indeed , retreat into the back rooms was of no avail ; the crowd had surrounded the outbuildings at the rear , and were sending forth their awful threatening roar behind . The servants retreated into the garrets , with many a cry and shriek . Mr. Thornton smiled scornfully as he heard them . He glanced at Margaret , standing all by herself at the window nearest the factory . Her eyes glittered , her colour was deepened on cheek and lip . As if she felt his look , she turned to him and asked a question that had been for some time in her mind : “
87956	87957	87792	87792	Jane	306	” “
88014	88015	88018	88019	the soldiers	2523	” “
88023	88059	88061	88061	Williams	307	” asked his mother , in a low but not unsteady voice . He took out his watch with the same steady composure with which he did everything . He made some little calculation : — “
88086	88087	88061	88061	Williams	307	” “
88091	88110	88117	88117	mother	445	” said his mother , for the first time showing her terror in the tones of her voice . “
88119	88123	88117	88117	mother	445	” exclaimed he : “
88141	88227	88138	88139	Miss Hale	187	” Margaret shut down her window , and then went to assist Mrs. Thornton ’s trembling fingers . From some cause or other , there was a pause of several minutes in the unseen street . Mrs. Thornton looked with wild anxiety at her son ’s countenance , as if to gain the interpretation of the sudden stillness from him . His face was set into rigid lines of contemptuous defiance ; neither hope nor fear could be read there . Fanny raised herself up : “
88232	88240	88229	88229	they	2523	” asked she , in a whisper . “
88243	88247	88138	88139	Miss Hale	187	” replied he . “
88250	88336	88138	88139	Miss Hale	187	” She did listen ; they all could hear the one great straining breath ; the creak of wood slowly yielding ; the wrench of iron ; the mighty fall of the ponderous gates . Fanny stood up tottering — made a step or two towards her mother , and fell forwards into her arms in a fainting fit . Mrs. Thornton lifted her up with a strength that was as much that of the will as of the body , and carried her away . “
88340	88351	88138	88139	Miss Hale	187	” said Mr. Thornton , as he watched her out . “
88362	88368	88353	88353	you	2526	” Margaret ’s lips formed a “
88369	88422	88138	88139	Miss Hale	187	No!”—but he could not hear her speak , for the tramp of innumerable steps right under the very wall of the house , and the fierce growl of low deep angry voices that had a ferocious murmur of satisfaction in them , more dreadful than their baffled cries not many minutes before . “
88426	88435	88138	88139	Miss Hale	187	” said he , thinking to encourage her . “
88471	88472	88465	88466	the soldiers	2523	” “
88477	88483	88465	88466	the soldiers	2523	” cried Margaret , suddenly ; “
88511	88512	88494	88494	he	262	” “
88517	88600	88602	88602	them	2523	” asked Mr. Thornton coolly , and coming close to the window to discover the man in whom Margaret took such an interest . As soon as they saw Mr. Thornton , they set up a yell , to call it not human is nothing,—it was as the demoniac desire of some terrible wild beast for the food that is withheld from his ravening . Even he drew back for a moment , dismayed at the intensity of hatred he had provoked . “
88605	88609	88602	88602	them	2523	” said he . “
88644	88645	88641	88642	Miss Hale	187	” “
88653	88658	88641	88642	Miss Hale	187	” she said hastily . “
88682	88683	88684	88685	The soldiers	2523	” “
88699	88700	88684	88685	The soldiers	2523	” “
88704	88710	88684	88685	The soldiers	2523	” said Margaret , quickly . “
88716	88717	88684	88685	The soldiers	2523	” “
88744	88745	88735	88735	they	806	” “
88749	88760	88746	88747	Mr. Thornton	179	” said Margaret , shaking all over with her passion , “
88855	88887	88888	88888	I	0	” He turned and looked at her while she spoke . A dark cloud came over his face while he listened . He set his teeth as he heard her words . “
88918	88919	88922	88923	Mr. Thornton	179	” “
88937	89535	88930	88930	I	0	” But he was gone ; he was downstairs in the hall ; he had unbarred the front door ; all she could do , was to follow him quickly , and fasten it behind him , and clamber up the stairs again with a sick heart and a dizzy head . Again she took her place by the farthest window . He was on the steps below ; she saw that by the direction of a thousand angry eyes ; but she could neither see nor hear anything save the savage satisfaction of the rolling angry murmur . See threw the window wide open . Many in the crowd were mere boys ; cruel and thoughtless,—cruel because they were thoughtless ; some were men , gaunt as wolves , and mad for prey . She knew how it was ; they were like Boucher,—with starving children at home — relying on ultimate success in their efforts to get higher wages , and enraged beyond measure at discovering that Irishmen were to be brought in to rob their little ones of bread . Margaret knew it all ; she read it in Boucher ’s face , forlornly desperate and livid with rage . If Mr. Thornton would but say something to them — let them hear his voice only — it seemed as if it would be better than this wild beating and raging against the stony silence that vouchsafed them no word , even of anger or reproach . But perhaps he was speaking now ; there was a momentary hush of their noise , inarticulate as that of a troop of animals . She tore her bonnet off , and bent forward to hear . She could only see ; for if Mr. Thornton had indeed made the attempt to speak , the momentary instinct to listen to him was past and gone , and the people were raging worse than ever . He stood with his arms folded ; still as a statue ; his face pale with repressed excitement . They were trying to intimidate him — to make him flinch ; each was urging the other on to some immediate act of personal violence . Margaret felt intuitively , that in an instant all would be uproar ; the first touch would cause an explosion , in which , among such hundreds of infuriated men and reckless boys , even Mr. Thornton ’s life would be unsafe,—that in another instant the stormy passions would have passed their bounds , and swept away all barriers of reason , or apprehension of consequence . Even while she looked , she saw lads in the background stooping to take off their heavy wooden clogs — the readiest missile they could find ; she saw it was the spark to the gunpowder , and , with a cry , which no one heard , she rushed out of the room , down stairs,—she had lifted the great iron bar of the door with an imperious force — had thrown the door open wide — and was there , in face of that angry sea of men , her eyes smiting them with flaming arrows of reproach . The clogs were arrested in the hands that held them — the countenances , so fell not a moment before , now looked irresolute , and as if asking what this meant . For she stood between them and their enemy . She could not speak , but held out her arms towards them till she could recover breath . “
89552	89606	88930	88930	I	0	” ; but her words died away , for there was no tone in her voice ; it was but a hoarse whisper . Mr. Thornton stood a little on one side ; he had moved away from behind her , as if jealous of anything that should come between him and danger . “
89609	89626	88930	88930	I	0	” said she , once more ( and now her voice was like a cry ) . “
89654	89655	89642	89642	You	2548	” “
89665	89680	89642	89642	You	2548	” asked one from out the crowd , with fierce threatening in his voice . “
89687	89809	89642	89642	You	2548	” exclaimed Mr. Thornton . And instantly the storm broke . The hootings rose and filled the air,—but Margaret did not hear them . Her eye was on the group of lads who had armed themselves with their clogs some time before . She saw their gesture — she knew its meaning — she read their aim . Another moment , and Mr. Thornton might be smitten down,—he whom she had urged and goaded to come to this perilous place . She only thought how she could save him . She threw her arms around him ; she made her body into a shield from the fierce people beyond . Still , with his arms folded , he shook her off . “
89813	89822	89642	89642	You	2548	” said he , in his deep voice . “
89830	89831	89642	89642	You	2548	” “
89835	89839	89642	89642	You	2548	” said she . “
89848	89997	89840	89840	You	2552	” If she thought her sex would be a protection,—if , with shrinking eyes she had turned away from the terrible anger of these men , in any hope that ere she looked again they would have paused and reflected , and slunk away , and vanished,—she was wrong . Their reckless passion had carried them too far to stop — at least had carried some of them too far ; for it is always the savage lads , with their love of cruel excitement , who head the riot — reckless to what bloodshed it may lead . A clog whizzed through the air . Margaret ’s fascinated eyes watched its progress ; it missed its aim , and she turned sick with affright , but changed not her position , only hid her face on Mr. Thornton ’s arm . Then she turned and spoke again : “
90021	90080	90012	90012	You	2553	” She strove to make her words distinct . A sharp pebble flew by her , grazing forehead and cheek , and drawing a blinding sheet of light before her eyes . She lay like one dead on Mr. Thornton ’s shoulder . Then he unfolded his arms , and held her encircled in one for an instant : “
90085	90089	90090	90090	You	2553	” said he . “
90139	90203	90135	90135	You	2553	” They were silent while he spoke . They were watching , open - eyed and open - mouthed , the thread of dark - red blood which wakened them up from their trance of passion . Those nearest the gate stole out ashamed ; there was a movement through all the crowd — a retreating movement . Only one voice called out : “
90220	90258	90213	90213	thou	2553	” Mr. Thornton quivered with rage . The blood - flowing had made Margaret conscious — dimly , vaguely conscious . He placed her gently on the door - step , her head leaning against the frame . “
90264	90289	90213	90213	thou	2553	” he asked . But without waiting for her answer , he went slowly down the steps right into the middle of the crowd . “
90332	90526	90330	90330	you	1521	” He stood amongst them with his arms folded , in precisely the same attitude as he had been in on the steps . But the retrograde movement towards the gate had begun — as unreasoningly , perhaps as blindly , as the simultaneous anger . Or , perhaps , the idea of the approach of the soldiers , and the sight of that pale , upturned face , with closed eyes , still and sad as marble , though the tears welled out of the long entanglement of eyelashes , and dropped down ; and , heavier , slower plash than even tears , came the drip of blood from her wound . Even the most desperate — Boucher himself — drew back , faltered away , scowled , and finally went off , muttering curses on the master , who stood in his unchanging attitude , looking after their retreat with defiant eyes . The moment that retreat had changed into a flight ( as it was sure from its very character to do ) , he darted up the steps to Margaret . She tried to rise without his help . “
90531	90540	90330	90330	you	1521	” she said , with a sickly smile . “
90564	90679	90680	90680	Mother	445	” And she cried without restraint . He could not sympathise with her . His anger had not abated ; it was rising the more as his sense of immediate danger was passing away . The distant clank of the soldiers was heard : just five minutes too late to make this vanished mob feel the power of authority and order . He hoped they would see the troops , and be quelled by the thought of their narrow escape . While these thoughts crossed his mind , Margaret clung to the doorpost to steady herself : but a film came over her eyes — he was only just in time to catch her . “
90684	90688	90682	90682	mother	445	” cried he ; “
90702	90755	90697	90698	Miss Hale	187	” He bore her into the dining - room , and laid her on the sofa there ; laid her down softly , and looking on her pure white face , the sense of what she was to him came upon him so keenly that he spoke it out in his pain : “
90797	90846	90795	90795	Margaret	123	” Inarticulately as he spoke , kneeling by her , and rather moaning than saying the words , he started up , ashamed of himself , as his mother came in . She saw nothing , but her son a little paler , a little sterner than usual . “
90874	90875	90876	90876	She	187	” “
90887	90897	90876	90876	She	187	” said Mrs. Thornton , a good deal alarmed . “
90913	90937	90906	90906	She	187	” But all the blood in his body seemed to rush inwards to his heart as he spoke , and he absolutely trembled . “
90972	91208	90966	90966	they	2569	” He went . He went away as if weights were tied to every limb that bore him from her . He called Jane ; he called his sister . She should have all womanly care , all gentle tendance . But every pulse beat in him as he remembered how she had come down and placed herself in foremost danger — could it be to save him ? At the time , he had pushed her aside , and spoken gruffly ; he had seen nothing but the unnecessary danger she had placed herself in . He went to his Irish people , with every nerve in his body thrilling at the thought of her , and found it difficult to understand enough of what they were saying to soothe and comfort away their fears . There , they declared , they would not stop ; they claimed to be sent back . And so he had to think , and talk , and reason . Mrs. Thornton bathed Margaret ’s temples with eau de Cologne . As the spirit touched the wound , which till then neither Mrs. Thornton nor Jane had perceived , Margaret opened her eyes ; but it was evident she did not know where she was , nor who they were . The dark circles deepened , the lips quivered and contracted , and she became insensible once more . “
91216	91221	91209	91209	She	2570	” said Mrs. Thornton . “
91233	91234	91236	91236	me	0	” “
91244	91251	91241	91241	you	5530	” said Jane , shrinking back . “
91275	91276	91277	91277	I	0	” “
91307	91308	91303	91303	I	0	” “
91333	91334	91330	91330	soldiers	5157	” “
91379	91384	91368	91368	You	5530	” she asked contemptuously , “
91405	91406	91397	91397	I	0	” “
91414	91415	91409	91409	Hannah	310	” “
91437	91464	91434	91434	I	0	” Mrs. Thornton went first to the room in which she had left Fanny stretched on the bed . She started up as her mother entered . “
91487	91488	91476	91476	you	5139	” “
91536	91537	91533	91534	the doctor	6023	” “
91550	91569	91545	91545	they	5157	” She clung to her mother ’s gown . Mrs. Thornton wrenched it away with no gentle hand . “
91587	91588	91545	91545	they	5157	” “
91602	91603	91604	91604	I	0	” “
91679	91680	91677	91677	myself	0	” “
91687	91716	91677	91677	myself	0	” said Fanny , crying , and preparing to go down rather than be left alone , with the thought of wounds and bloodshed in the very house . “
91721	91732	91719	91719	Jane	306	” said she , creeping into the dining - room , “
91759	91913	91750	91750	they	2600	” Margaret did indeed look white and wan , although her senses were beginning to return to her . But the sickly daze of the swoon made her still miserably faint . She was conscious of movement around her , and of refreshment from the eau de Cologne , and a craving for the bathing to go on without intermission ; but when they stopped to talk , she could no more have opened her eyes , or spoken to ask for more bathing , than the people who lie in death - like trance can move , or utter sound , to arrest the awful preparations for their burial , while they are yet fully aware , not merely of the actions of those around them , but of the idea that is the motive for such actions . Jane paused in her bathing , to reply to Miss Thornton ’s question . “
91958	91959	91750	91750	they	2600	” “
91965	91988	91750	91750	they	2600	” said Fanny , drawing nearer by slow degrees , as she became accustomed to the sight of Margaret ’s pale face . “
91998	92004	91750	91750	they	2600	” said Jane , significantly . “
92018	92019	92014	92014	she	1891	” “
92032	92044	92045	92045	Sarah	160	” answered Jane , with a slight toss of her head . “
92049	92050	92051	92051	Sarah	160	” “
92054	92084	92085	92085	Sarah	160	” said Fanny , with impatient curiosity . Jane resumed her bathing , as if what Sarah did or said was not exactly the thing she liked to repeat . “
92088	92094	92085	92085	Sarah	160	” asked Fanny , sharply . “
92110	92111	92108	92108	you	0	” “
92175	92176	92161	92161	her	160	” “
92183	92187	92177	92177	I	0	” said Fanny . “
92247	92248	92241	92241	her	160	” “
92298	92299	92291	92291	She	160	” “
92308	92316	92304	92304	mamma	5139	” said Fanny , wringing her hands . “
92329	92330	92304	92304	mamma	5139	” “
92366	92367	92363	92364	Miss Fanny	218	” “
92373	92424	92427	92427	she	160	” asked Fanny , in a quavering voice . No answer ; no sign of recognition ; but a faint pink colour returned to her lips , although the rest of her face was ashen pale . Mrs. Thornton came hurriedly in , with the nearest surgeon she could find . “
92436	92450	92427	92427	she	160	” as Margaret opened her filmy eyes , and gazed dreamily at her . “
92460	92491	92453	92454	Mr. Lowe	311	” Mrs. Thornton spoke loudly and distinctly , as to a deaf person . Margaret tried to rise , and drew her ruffled , luxuriant hair instinctively over the cut . “
92497	92509	92492	92492	I	0	” said she , in a very low , faint voice . “
92516	92570	92510	92510	I	0	” She let him take her hand and feel her pulse . The bright colour came for a moment into her face , when he asked to examine the wound in her forehead ; and she glanced up at Jane , as if shrinking from her inspection more than from the doctor ’s . “
92589	92590	92584	92584	I	0	” “
92608	92626	92593	92593	I	0	” She sat down hastily , without another word , and allowed it to be bound up . “
92633	92637	92630	92630	you	0	” said she , “
92661	92662	92642	92642	Mamma	163	” “
92670	92671	92642	92642	Mamma	163	” “
92678	92685	92673	92673	you	0	” said Mrs. Thornton , impatiently . “
92693	92694	92695	92695	I	0	” “
92698	92704	92695	92695	I	0	” said Margaret , decidedly . “
92721	92727	92717	92717	I	0	” said she , vehemently . “
92741	92742	92743	92743	You	0	” “
92750	92755	92743	92743	You	0	” observed Mr. Lowe . “
92785	92789	92796	92796	she	5139	” pleaded she . “
92799	92804	92796	92796	she	5139	” Mr. Lowe replied . “
92867	92868	92872	92872	you	0	” “
92874	92878	92872	92872	you	0	” said Margaret . “
92902	92980	92982	92982	you	0	” She leant back on the sofa , and closed her eyes . Fanny beckoned her mother out of the room , and told her something that made her equally anxious with Margaret for the departure of the latter . Not that she fully believed Fanny ’s statement ; but she credited enough to make her manner to Margaret appear very much constrained , at wishing her good - bye . Mr. Lowe returned in the cab . “
93004	93119	93128	93128	her	5657	” Margaret ’s thoughts were quite alive enough to the present to make her desirous of getting rid of both Mr. Lowe and the cab before she reached Crampton Crescent , for fear of alarming her father and mother . Beyond that one aim she would not look . That ugly dream of insolent words spoken about herself , could never be forgotten — but could be put aside till she was stronger — for , oh ! she was very weak ; and her mind sought for some present fact to steady itself upon , and keep it from utterly losing consciousness in another hideous , sickly swoon . CHAPTER XXIII . MISTAKES . “
93141	93164	93126	93126	she	5657	” SPENSER . Margaret had not been gone five minutes when Mr. Thornton came in , his face all a - glow . “
93180	93213	93171	93172	the superintendent	2638	” He looked round the dining - room , and then almost fiercely at his mother , who was quietly re - arranging the disturbed furniture , and did not instantly reply . “
93219	93224	93216	93217	Miss Hale	187	” asked he again . “
93228	93235	93216	93217	Miss Hale	187	” said she , rather shortly . “
93239	93240	93171	93172	the superintendent	2638	” “
93274	93275	93276	93276	I	0	” “
93284	93292	93293	93293	She	5657	” said he , walking uneasily about . “
93302	93303	93304	93304	She	5657	” “
93322	93323	93316	93316	I	0	” “
93329	93354	93327	93327	mother	445	” He stopped , and partly held out his hand to give her a grateful shake . But she did not notice the movement . “
93364	93365	93357	93357	you	0	” “
93427	93428	93429	93429	She	187	” “

93543	93752	93541	93541	Mother	445	” He made a step forwards ; stood still ; heaved with passion . She was a little startled at the evident force he used to keep himself calm . She was not sure of the nature of the emotions she had provoked . It was only their violence that was clear . Was it anger ? His eyes glowed , his figure was dilated , his breath came thick and fast . It was a mixture of joy , of anger , of pride , of glad surprise , of panting doubt ; but she could not read it . Still it made her uneasy,—as the presence of all strong feeling , of which the cause is not fully understood or sympathised in , always has this effect . She went to the side - board , opened a drawer , and took out a duster , which she kept there for any occasional purpose . She had seen a drop of eau de Cologne on the polished arm of the sofa , and instinctively sought to wipe it off . But she kept her back turned to her son much longer than was necessary ; and when she spoke , her voice seemed unusual and constrained . “

94010	94029	94008	94008	Clarkson	316	” Their eyes met ; they looked at each other intently for a minute . Then she asked : “
94038	94039	94032	94032	you	0	” “
94046	94047	94048	94048	I	0	” “

94138	94170	94109	94109	she	187	” He glanced sharply at her ; saw that she did not know what had passed between him and Margaret in the drawing - room : and replied by another question : “
94232	94374	94221	94221	I	0	” Mrs. Thornton left the room . Her servants wondered at her directions , usually so sharply - cut and decided , now confused and uncertain . Mr. Thornton remained in the dining - room , trying to think of the business he had to do at the police - office , and in reality thinking of Margaret . Everything seemed dim and vague beyond — behind — besides the touch of her arms round his neck — the soft clinging which made the dark colour come and go in his cheek as he thought of it . The tea would have been very silent , but for Fanny ’s perpetual description of her own feelings ; how she had been alarmed — and then thought they were gone — and then felt sick and faint and trembling in every limb . “
94381	94391	94221	94221	I	0	” said her brother , rising from the table . “
94399	94420	94421	94421	You	0	” He was going to leave the room , when his mother stopped him with her hand upon his arm . “
94434	94445	94421	94421	You	0	” said she , in a low , anxious voice . “
94452	94458	94449	94449	I	0	” said Fanny to herself . “
94470	94471	94472	94472	John	262	” “
94513	94539	94511	94511	John	262	” She had seldom pleaded with her son at all — she was too proud for that ; but she had never pleaded in vain . “
94562	94695	94696	94696	Mother	445	” Mrs. Thornton was by no means a talkative companion to Fanny , nor yet a good listener while her son was absent . But on his return , her eyes and ears were keen to see and to listen to all the details which he could give , as to the steps he had taken to secure himself , and those whom he chose to employ , from any repetition of the day ’s outrages . He clearly saw his object . Punishment and suffering were the natural consequences to those who had taken part in the riot . All that was necessary , in order that property should be protected , and that the will of the proprietor might cut to his end , clean and sharp as a sword . “
94714	94742	94701	94701	I	0	” The question came upon her suddenly , during a pause in which she , at least , had forgotten Margaret . She looked up at him . “

94765	94766	94763	94763	you	0	” “

94990	95006	94986	94986	me	0	” said Mrs. Thornton , smiling slowly , while the tears stood in her eyes ; “

95051	95086	95035	95035	I	0	” ( Still love is selfish , and in an instant he reverted to his own hopes and fears in a way that drew the cold creeping shadow over Mrs. Thornton ’s heart . ) “

95133	95174	95122	95122	I	0	” said his mother , crushing down her own personal mortification at the little notice he had taken of the rare ebullition of her maternal feelings — of the pang of jealousy that betrayed the intensity of her disregarded love . “
95180	95186	95122	95122	I	0	” she said , coldly . “
95219	95310	95217	95217	John	262	” said she , kissing him , as she wished him good - night . And she went slowly and majestically out of the room . But when she got into her own , she locked the door , and sate down to cry unwonted tears . * * * * * Margaret entered the room ( where her father and mother still sat , holding low conversation together ) , looking very pale and white . She came close up to them before she could trust herself to speak . “
95322	95323	95311	95312	Mrs. Thornton	216	” “
95338	95339	95336	95336	Margaret	123	” “
95353	95371	95336	95336	Margaret	123	” Margaret ’s colour came back vivid and bright as ever ; but it faded away instantly . “
95388	95393	95378	95379	Bessy Higgins	204	” said Mrs. Hale . “
95403	95404	95395	95395	I	0	” “
95407	95411	95395	95395	I	0	” said Margaret . “
95421	95483	95416	95416	I	0	” She was very silent and trembling while she made tea . She was thankful to see her father so much occupied with her mother as not to notice her looks . Even after her mother went to bed , he was not content to be absent from her , but undertook to read her to sleep . Margaret was alone . “
95507	95542	95543	95543	I	0	” She sat still in her chair , her hands clasped on her knees , her lips compressed , her eyes fixed as one who sees a vision . She drew a deep breath . “
95604	95622	95600	95600	I	0	” But this was overleaping the rational conclusion,—as in an instant her well - poised judgment felt . “
95653	95662	95667	95668	those people	2685	” said she , clenching her hands together , “
95693	95727	95684	95684	I	0	” Her pale cheeks suddenly became one flame of fire ; and she covered her face with her hands . When she took them away , her palms were wet with scalding tears . “
95805	95810	95855	95855	them	2523	” said she vehemently , “
95921	95941	95915	95915	I	0	” She looked up , and a noble peace seemed to descend and calm her face , till it was “
95947	95952	95915	95915	I	0	” Dixon came in : “
96000	96001	96033	96033	he	5410	” “
96004	96008	96009	96009	You	2689	” said Margaret . “
96016	96025	96009	96009	You	2689	” Dixon left the room for a moment . “
96066	96067	96068	96068	Me	0	” “
96070	96078	96068	96068	Me	0	” said Margaret , drawing herself up . “
96091	96188	96085	96085	him	5410	” But her complexion was as deadly white as her handkerchief ; and her head ached intensely . Mr. Hale now came in . He had left his sleeping wife ; and wanted , as Margaret saw , to be amused and interested by something that she was to tell him . With sweet patience did she bear her pain , without a word of complaint ; and rummaged up numberless small subjects for conversation — all except the riot , and that she never named once . It turned her sick to think of it . “
96247	96248	96237	96237	I	0	” “
96255	96461	96253	96253	papa	528	” She let her colour go — the false smile fade away — the eyes grow dull with heavy pain . She released her strong will from its laborious task . Till morning she might feel ill and weary . She lay down and never stirred . To move hand or foot , or even so much as one finger , would have been beyond the powers of either volition or motion . She was so tired , so stunned , that she thought she never slept at all ; her feverish thoughts passed and repassed the boundary between sleeping and waking , and kept their own miserable identity . She could not be alone , prostrate , powerless as she was,—a cloud of faces looked up at her , giving her no idea of fierce vivid anger , or of personal danger , but a deep sense of shame that she should thus be the object of universal regard — a sense of shame so acute that it seemed as if she would fain have burrowed into the earth to hide herself , and yet she could not escape out of that unwinking glare of many eyes . CHAPTER XXIV . MISTAKES CLEARED UP . “
96517	96774	96503	96504	your servant	2698	” WILLIAM FOWLER . The next morning , Margaret dragged herself up , thankful that the night was over,—unrefreshed , yet rested . All had gone well through the house ; her mother had only wakened once . A little breeze was stirring in the hot air , and though there were no trees to show the playful tossing movement caused by the wind among the leaves , Margaret knew how , somewhere or another , by wayside , in copses , or in thick green woods , there was a pleasant , murmuring dancing sound,—a rushing and falling noise , the very thought of which was an echo of distinct gladness in her heart . She sat at her work in Mrs. Hale ’s room . As soon as that forenoon slumber was over , she would help her mother to dress ; after dinner , she would go and see Bessy Higgins . She would banish all recollection of the Thornton family — no need to think of them till they absolutely stood before her in flesh and blood . But , of course , the effort not to think of them brought them only the more strongly before her ; and from time to time , the hot flush came over her pale face sweeping it into colour , as a sunbeam from between watery clouds comes swiftly moving over the sea . Dixon opened the door very softly , and stole on tiptoe up to Margaret , sitting by the shaded window . “
96789	96795	96781	96781	He	179	” Margaret dropped her sewing . “
96808	96809	96804	96804	papa	528	” “
96822	96823	96818	96818	master	5403	” “
96831	97420	97421	97422	Miss Hale	187	” said Margaret , quietly . But she lingered strangely . Mr. Thornton stood by one of the windows , with his back to the door apparently absorbed in watching something in the street . But , in truth , he was afraid of himself . His heart beat thick at the thought of her coming . He could not forget the touch of her arms around his neck , impatiently felt as it had been at the time ; but now the recollection of her clinging defence of him , seemed to thrill him through and through,—to melt away every resolution , all power of self - control , as if it were wax before a fire . He dreaded lest he should go forwards to meet her , with his arms held out in mute entreaty that she would come and nestle there , as she had done , all unheeded , the day before , but never unheeded again . His heart throbbed loud and quick . Strong man as he was , he trembled at the anticipation of what he had to say , and how it might be received . She might droop , and flush , and flutter to his arms , as to her natural home and resting - place . One moment he glowed with impatience at the thought that she might do this,—the next he feared a passionate rejection , the idea of which withered up his future with so deadly a blight that he refused to think of it . He was startled by the sense of the presence of some one else in the room . He turned round . She had come in so gently , that he had never heard her ; the street noises had been more distinct to his inattentive ear than her slow movements , in her soft muslin gown . She stood by the table , not offering to sit down . Her eyelids were dropped half over her eyes ; her teeth were shut , not compressed ; her lips were just parted over them , allowing the white line to be seen between their curve . Her slow deep breathings dilated her chin and beautiful nostrils ; it was the only motion visible on her countenance . The fine - grained skin , the oval cheek , the rich outline of her mouth , its corners deep set in dimples,—were all wan and pale to - day ; the loss of their usual natural healthy colour being made more evident by the heavy shadow of the dark hair , brought down upon her temples , to hide all sign of the blow she had received . Her head , for all its drooping eyes , was thrown a little back , in the old proud attitude . Her long arms hung motionless by her sides . Altogether she looked like some prisoner , falsely accused of a crime that she loathed and despised , and from which she was too indignant to justify herself . Mr. Thornton made a hasty step or two forwards ; recovered himself , and went with quiet firmness to the door ( which she had left open ) , and shut it . Then he came back , and stood opposite to her for a moment , receiving the general impression of her beautiful presence , before he dared to disturb it , perhaps to repel it , by what he had to say . “
97430	97431	97424	97424	I	0	” “
97440	97455	97456	97456	You	0	” said she raising her eyes , and looking full and straight at him . “
97475	97514	97465	97465	you	0	” In spite of herself — in defiance of her anger — the thick blushes came all over her face , and burnt into her very eyes ; which fell not nevertheless from their grave and steady look . “
97552	97558	97548	97548	I	0	” said she , hastily , “
97577	97578	97582	97582	your	0	” “
97620	97661	97618	97618	my	0	” he was on the verge now ; he would not speak in the haste of his hot passion ; he would weigh each word . He would ; and his will was triumphant . He stopped in mid career . “
97671	97675	97676	97676	I	0	” said she . “
97729	97730	97731	97731	I	0	” “
97742	97752	97731	97731	I	0	” said he , goaded by her calm manner . “
97813	97835	97810	97811	Miss Hale	187	” continued he , lowering his voice to such a tender intensity of passion that she shivered and trembled before him , “
97931	97938	97926	97926	you	2706	hear,”—said he , stepping forward with stern determination—“to
97955	98011	98012	98012	Your	2706	” He held her hand tight in his . He panted as he listened for what should come . He threw the hand away with indignation , as he heard her icy tone ; for icy it was , though the words came faltering out , as if she knew not where to find them . “
98084	98085	98078	98078	your	2706	” “
98088	98092	98078	98078	your	2706	” exclaimed he . “
98102	98103	98096	98096	I	0	” “
98106	98113	98096	98096	I	0	” said she with recovered dignity . “
98134	98150	98126	98126	You	2706	yesterday”—again the deep carnation blush , but this time with eyes kindling with indignation rather than shame—“was
98184	98198	98181	98182	a gentleman	5318	” she repeated , in allusion to their former conversation about that word , “
98231	98232	98217	98217	her	2703	” “
98245	98251	98252	98252	I	0	” he broke in contemptuously . “
98266	98267	98257	98257	I	0	” “
98287	98293	98278	98278	you	2706	” she replied , proudly . “
98311	98334	98295	98295	you	2706	but”—and here the passionate tears ( kept down for long — struggled with vehemently ) came up into her eyes and choked her voice—“but
98388	98389	98390	98390	You	2706	” “
98459	98460	98453	98453	you	2706	” “
98468	98502	98461	98461	I	0	” she replied , taking hold of the table to steady herself ; for she thought him cruel — as , indeed , he was — and she was weak with her indignation . “
98517	98614	98619	98619	You	2706	” Margaret compressed her lips . She would not speak in answer to such accusations . But , for all that — for all his savage words , he could have thrown himself at her feet , and kissed the hem of her garment . She did not speak ; she did not move . The tears of wounded pride fell hot and fast . He waited awhile , longing for her to say something , even a taunt , to which he might reply . But she was silent . He took up his hat . “
98708	98709	98710	98710	I	0	” “
98715	98724	98710	98710	I	0	” she replied , lifting herself straight up . “
98757	98773	98748	98748	you	179	” said she , changing her whole tone and bearing to a most womanly softness . “
98789	98911	98748	98748	you	179	” He took no notice of her words ; he occupied himself in smoothing the nap of his hat with his coat - sleeve , for half a minute or so ; and then , rejecting her offered hand , and making as if he did not see her grave look of regret , he turned abruptly away , and left the room . Margaret caught one glance at his face before he went . When he was gone she thought she had seen the gleam of washed tears in his eyes ; and that turned her proud dislike into something different and kinder , if nearly as painful — self - reproach for having caused such mortification to any one . “
98919	98925	98915	98915	I	0	” asked she of herself . “
99003	99009	99010	99010	Revenge	318	” CHAPTER XXV . FREDERICK . “
99031	99433	99434	99434	His	2733	” BYRON . Margaret began to wonder whether all offers were as unexpected beforehand,—as distressing at the time of their occurrence , as the two she had had . An involuntary comparison between Mr. Lennox and Mr. Thornton arose in her mind . She had been sorry , that an expression of any other feeling than friendship had been lured out by circumstances from Henry Lennox . That regret was the predominant feeling , on the first occasion of her receiving a proposal . She had not felt so stunned — so impressed as she did now , when echoes of Mr. Thornton ’s voice yet lingered about the room . In Lennox ’s case , he seemed for a moment to have slid over the boundary between friendship and love ; and the instant afterwards , to regret it nearly as much as she did , although for different reasons . In Mr. Thornton ’s case , as far as Margaret knew , there was no intervening stage of friendship . Their intercourse had been one continued series of opposition . Their opinions clashed ; and indeed , she had never perceived that he had cared for her opinions , as belonging to her , the individual . As far as they defied his rock - like power of character , his passion - strength , he seemed to throw them off from him with contempt , until she felt the weariness of the exertion of making useless protests ; and now , he had come , in this strange wild passionate way , to make known his love ! For , although at first it had struck her , that his offer was forced and goaded out of him by sharp compassion for the exposure she had made of herself,—which he , like others , might misunderstand — yet , even before he left the room,—and certainly not five minutes after , the clear conviction dawned upon her , shined bright upon her , that he did love her ; that he had loved her ; that he would love her . And she shrank and shuddered as under the fascination of some great power , repugnant to her whole previous life . She crept away , and hid from his idea . But it was of no use . To parody a line out of Fairfax ’s Tasso — “
99442	99721	99434	99434	His	2733	” She disliked him the more for having mastered her inner will . How dared he say that he would love her still , even though she shook him off with contempt ? She wished she had spoken more — stronger . Sharp , decisive speeches came thronging into her mind , now that it was too late to utter them . The deep impression made by the interview , was like that of a horror in a dream ; that will not leave the room although we waken up , and rub our eyes , and force a stiff rigid smile upon our lips . It is there — there , cowering and gibbering , with fixed ghastly eyes , in some corner of the chamber , listening to hear whether we dare to breathe of its presence to any one . And we dare not ; poor cowards that we are ! And so she shuddered away from the threat of his enduring love . What did he mean ? Had she not the power to daunt him ? She would see . It was more daring than became a man to threaten her so . Did he ground it upon the miserable yesterday ? If need were , she would do the same to - morrow,—by a crippled beggar , willingly and gladly,—but by him , she would do it , just as bravely , in spite of his deductions , and the cold slime of woman ’s impertinence . She did it because it was right , and simple , and true to save where she could save ; even to try to save . “
99731	99884	99434	99434	His	2733	” Hitherto she had not stirred from where he had left her ; no outward circumstances had roused her out of the trance of thought in which she had been plunged by his last words , and by the look of his deep intent passionate eyes , as their flames had made her own fall before them . She went to the window , and threw it open , to dispel the oppression which hung around her . Then she went and opened the door , with a sort of impetuous wish to shake off the recollection of the past hour , in the company of others , or in active exertion . But all was profoundly hushed in the noonday stillness of a house , where an invalid catches the unrefreshing sleep that is denied to the night - hours . Margaret would not be alone . What should she do ? “
99894	100010	100011	100011	I	0	” thought she , as the recollection of the message sent the night before flashed into her mind . And away she went . When she got there , she found Bessy lying on the settle , moved close to the fire , though the day was sultry and oppressive . She was laid down quite flat , as if resting languidly after some paroxysm of pain . Margaret felt sure she ought to have the greater freedom of breathing which a more sitting posture would procure ; and , without a word , she raised her up , and so arranged the pillows , that Bessy was more at ease , though very languid . “
100024	100038	100011	100011	I	0	” said she , at last , looking wistfully in Margaret ’s face . “
100065	100071	100055	100056	my mother	5749	” said Margaret , colouring . “

100224	100266	100303	100303	m’appen	2343	” Margaret began . Bessy tossed to and fro . If , by an effort , she attended for one moment , it seemed as though she were convulsed into double restlessness the next . At last , she burst out : “
100318	100319	100310	100310	Thornton	179	” “
100329	100335	100337	100337	he	5373	” said Margaret colouring deeply . “
100402	100403	100394	100395	a man	940	” “
100407	100411	100412	100412	I	0	” asked Margaret . “
100417	100418	100412	100412	I	0	” “
100933	100938	100939	100939	they	2773	” dropping her voice , “

100965	100969	100954	100954	welly	2775	” said Margaret . “
100977	100985	100973	100973	Boucher	262	stone”—she went first red , then white . “
100995	101019	100992	100992	yo	2776	” asked Bessie languidly : for indeed , she had spoken with many pauses , as if speech was unusually difficult to her . “
101047	101048	101049	101049	He	262	” “
101536	101792	101531	101531	I	0	” Margaret read in her soft low voice . Though Bessy ’s eyes were shut , she was listening for some time , for the moisture of tears gathered heavy on her eyelashes . At last she slept ; with many starts , and muttered pleadings . Margaret covered her up , and left her , for she had an uneasy consciousness that she might be wanted at home , and yet , until now , it seemed cruel to leave the dying girl . Mrs. Hale was in the drawing - room on her daughter ’s return . It was one of her better days , and she was full of praises of the water - bed . It had been more like the beds at Sir John Beresford ’s than anything she had slept on since . She did not know how it was , but people seemed to have lost the art of making the same kind of beds as they used to do in her youth . One would think it was easy enough ; there was the same kind of feathers to be had , and yet somehow , till this last night she did not know when she had had a good sound resting sleep . Mr. Hale suggested , that something of the merits of the feather - beds of former days might be attributed to the activity of youth , which gave a relish to rest ; but this idea was not kindly received by his wife . “
101884	101888	101894	101894	mamma	5139	” Margaret laughed . “
101967	101968	101970	101970	you	123	” “
102237	102238	102227	102227	He	242	” “
102272	102273	102265	102265	he	244	” “
102398	102466	102467	102467	Margaret	123	” Margaret sat down by her mother ’s sofa on a little stool , and softly took hold of her hand , caressing it and kissing it , as if to comfort . Mrs. Hale cried without restraint . At last , she sat straight , stiff up on the sofa , and turning round to her daughter , she said with tearful , almost solemn earnestness , “
102508	102552	102555	102555	Margaret	123	” She paused , and seemed to try and gather strength for something more yet to be said . Her voice was choked as she went on — was quavering as with the contemplation of some strange , yet closely - present idea . “
102651	102864	102865	102865	Mamma	5139	” Margaret did not think of anything that might be utterly unreasonable in this speech : we do not look for reason or logic in the passionate entreaties of those who are sick unto death ; we are stung with the recollection of a thousand slighted opportunities of fulfilling the wishes of those who will soon pass away from among us : and do they ask us for the future happiness of our lives , we lay it at their feet , and will it away from us . But this wish of Mrs. Hale ’s was so natural , so just , so right to both parties , that Margaret felt as if , on Frederick ’s account as well as on her mother ’s , she ought to overlook all intermediate chances of danger , and pledge herself to do everything in her power for its realization . The large , pleading , dilated eyes were fixed upon her wistfully , steady in their gaze , though the poor white lips quivered like those of a child . Margaret gently rose up and stood opposite to her frail mother ; so that she might gather the secure fulfilment of her wish from the calm steadiness of her daughter ’s face . “
102919	102920	102921	102921	You	0	” “
103005	103006	103009	103009	mamma	5139	” “
103015	103016	103017	103017	Papa	139	” “
103069	103070	103051	103051	he	139	” “
103075	103079	103073	103073	mamma	5139	” said Margaret . “
103216	103244	103245	103245	You	123	” She fell back , and for a short time she took no notice of the fact that Margaret sat motionless , her hand shading her eyes . “
103250	103257	103245	103245	You	123	” said her mother at last . “
103272	103297	103245	103245	You	123	” She sat up , trembling all over with feverish eagerness . Margaret took her hand down , and looked at her mother sadly . “
103315	103316	103317	103317	You	123	” “
103334	103335	103341	103341	mamma	5139	” “
103413	103584	103398	103398	mamma	5139	” Mrs. Hale could not stop her tears ; they came hysterically ; and , in truth , she made no effort to control them , but rather called up all the pictures of the happy past , and the probable future — painting the scene when she should lie a corpse , with the son she had longed to see in life weeping over her , and she unconscious of his presence — till she was melted by self - pity into a state of sobbing and exhaustion that made Margaret ’s heart ache . But at last she was calm , and greedily watched her daughter , as she began her letter ; wrote it with swift urgent entreaty ; sealed it up hurriedly , for fear her mother should ask to see it : and then to make security most sure , at Mrs. Hale ’s own bidding , took it herself to the post - office . She was coming home when her father overtook her . “
103595	103599	103398	103398	mamma	5139	” asked he . “
103675	103688	103689	103689	You	2842	” Mr. Hale did not reply at first . Then he said : “
103700	103701	103702	103702	I	0	” “
103708	103715	103702	103702	I	0	” and then she was silent . “
103721	103730	103702	103702	I	0	” said Mr. Hale , after a pause . “
103783	103784	103775	103775	I	0	” “
103794	103795	103792	103792	papa	528	” “
103968	103969	103972	103972	papa	528	” “
104000	104001	104003	104003	he	159	” “
104078	104161	104162	104162	I	0	” It was all very well ; but her father ’s account of the relentless manner in which mutinies were punished made Margaret shiver and creep . If she had decoyed her brother home to blot out the memory of his error by his blood ! She saw her father ’s anxiety lap deeper than the source of his latter cheering words . She took his arm and walked home pensively and wearily by his side . CHAPTER XXVI . MOTHER AND SON “
104173	105971	105974	105974	John	157	” MRS . HEMANS . When Mr. Thornton had left the house that morning he was almost blinded by his baffled passion . He was as dizzy as if Margaret , instead of looking , and speaking , and moving like a tender graceful woman , had been a sturdy fish - wife , and given him a sound blow with her fists . He had positive bodily pain — a violent headache , and a throbbing intermittent pulse . He could not bear the noise , the garish light , the continued rumble and movement of the street . He called himself a fool for suffering so ; and yet he could not , at the moment , recollect the cause of his suffering , and whether it was adequate to the consequences it had produced . It would have been a relief to him , if he could have sat down and cried on a door - step by a little child , who was raging and storming , through his passionate tears , at some injury he had received . He said to himself , that he hated Margaret , but a wild , sharp sensation of love cleft his dull , thunderous feeling like lightning , even as he shaped the words expressive of hatred . His greatest comfort was in hugging his torment and in feeling , as he had indeed said to her , that though she might despise him , contemn him , treat him with her proud sovereign indifference , he did not change one whit . She could not make him change . He loved her , and would love her ; and defy her , and this miserable bodily pain . He stood still for a moment , to make this resolution firm and clear . There was an omnibus passing — going into the country ; the conductor thought he was wishing for a place , and stopped near the pavement . It was too much trouble to apologise and explain ; so he mounted upon it , and was borne away — past long rows of houses — then past detached villas with trim gardens , till they came to real country hedge - rows , and , by - and - by , to a small country town . Then everybody got down ; and so did Mr. Thornton , and because they walked away he did so too . He went into the fields , walking briskly , because the sharp motion relieved his mind . He could remember all about it now ; the pitiful figure he must have cut ; the absurd way in which he had gone and done the very thing he had so often agreed with himself in thinking would be the most foolish thing in the world ; and had met with exactly the consequences which , in these wise moods , he had always foretold were certain to follow , if he ever did make such a fool of himself . Was he bewitched by those beautiful eyes , that soft , half - open , sighing mouth which lay so close upon his shoulder only yesterday ? He could not even shake off the recollection that she had been there ; that her arms had been round him , once — if never again . He only caught glimpses of her ; he did not understand her altogether . At one time she was so brave , and at another so timid ; now so tender , and then so haughty and regal proud . And then he thought over every time he had ever seen her once again , by way of finally forgetting her . He saw her in every dress , in every mood , and did not know which became her best . Even this morning how magnificent she had looked — her eyes flashing out upon him at the idea that , because she had shared his danger yesterday , she had cared for him the least ! If Mr. Thornton was a fool in the morning , as he assured himself at least twenty times he was , he did not grow much wiser in the afternoon . All that he gained for his sixpenny omnibus ride , was a more vivid conviction that there never was , never could be , any one like Margaret ; that she did not love him and never would ; but that she — no ! nor the whole world — should never hinder him from loving her . And so he returned to the little market - place , and remounted the omnibus to return to Milton . It was late in the afternoon when he was set down , near his warehouse . The accustomed places brought back the accustomed habits and trains of thought . He knew how much he had to do — more than his usual work , owing to the commotion of the day before . He had to see his brother magistrates ; he had to complete the arrangements , only half made in the morning , for the comfort and safety of his newly imported Irish hands ; he had to secure them from all chance of communication with the discontented workpeople of Milton . Last of all , he had to go home and encounter his mother . Mrs. Thornton had sat in the dining - room all day , every moment expecting the news of her son ’s acceptance by Miss Hale . She had braced herself up many and many a time , at some sudden noise in the house ; had caught up the half - dropped work , and begun to ply her needle diligently , though through dimmed spectacles , and with an unsteady hand ! and many times had the door opened , and some indifferent person entered on some insignificant errand . Then her rigid face unstiffened from its gray frost - bound expression , and the features dropped into the relaxed look of despondency , so unusual to their sternness . She wrenched herself away from the contemplation of all the dreary changes that would be brought about to herself by her son ’s marriage ; she forced her thoughts into the accustomed household grooves . The newly - married couple - to - be would need fresh household stocks of linen : and Mrs. Thornton had clothes - basket upon clothes - basket , full of table - cloths and napkins , brought in , and began to reckon up the store . There was some confusion between what was hers , and consequently marked G. H. T. ( for George and Hannah Thornton ) , and what was her son’s — bought with his money , marked with his initials . Some of those marked G. H. T. were Dutch damask of the old kind , exquisitely fine ; none were like them now . Mrs. Thornton stood looking at them long,—they had been her pride when she was first married . Then she knit her brows , and pinched and compressed her lips tight , and carefully unpicked the G.H. She went so far as to search for the Turkey - red marking - thread to put in the new initials ; but it was all used,—and she had no heart to send for any more just yet . So she looked fixedly at vacancy ; a series of visions passing before her , in all of which her son was the principal , the sole object,—her son , her pride , her property . Still he did not come . Doubtless he was with Miss Hale . The new love was displacing her already from her place as first in his heart . A terrible pain — a pang of vain jealousy — shot through her : she hardly knew whether it was more physical or mental ; but it forced her to sit down . In a moment , she was up again as straight as ever,—a grim smile upon her face for the first time that day , ready for the door opening , and the rejoicing triumphant one , who should never know the sore regret his mother felt at his marriage . In all this , there was little thought enough of the future daughter - in - law as an individual . She was to be John ’s wife . To take Mrs. Thornton ’s place as mistress of the house , was only one of the rich consequences which decked out the supreme glory : all household plenty and comfort , all purple and fine linen , honour , love , obedience , troops of friends , would all come as naturally as jewels on a king ’s robe , and be as little thought of for their separate value . To be chosen by John , would separate a kitchen - wench from the rest of the world . And Miss Hale was not so bad . If she had been a Milton lass , Mrs. Thornton would have positively liked her . She was pungent , and had taste , and spirit , and flavour in her . True , she was sadly prejudiced , and very ignorant ; but that was to be expected from her southern breeding . A strange sort of mortified comparison of Fanny with her , went on in Mrs. Thornton ’s mind ; and for once she spoke harshly to her daughter ; abused her roundly ; and then , by way of penance , she took up Henry ’s Commentaries , and tried to fix her attention on it , instead of pursuing the employment she took pride in , and continuing her inspection of the table - linen . _ His _ step at last ! She heard him , even while she thought she was finishing a sentence ; while her eye did pass over it , and her memory could mechanically have repeated it word for word , she heard him come in at the hall - door . Her quickened sense could interpret every sound of motion : now he was at the hat - stand — now at the very room - door . Why did he pause ? Let her know the worst . Yet her head was down over the book ; she did not look up . He came close to the table , and stood still there , waiting till she should have finished the paragraph which apparently absorbed her . By an effort she looked up . “
105976	106048	105974	105974	John	157	” He knew what that little speech meant . But he had steeled himself . He longed to reply with a jest ; the bitterness of his heart could have uttered one , but his mother deserved better of him . He came round behind her , so that she could not see his looks , and , bending back her gray , stony face , he kissed it , murmuring : “
106063	106129	106061	106061	mother	445	” He turned away and stood leaning his head against the mantelpiece , tears forcing themselves into his manly eyes . She stood up,—she tottered . For the first time in her life , the strong woman tottered . She put her hands on his shoulders ; she was a tall woman . She looked into his face : she made him look at her . “
106178	106203	106176	106176	she	5377	” She set her teeth ; she showed them like a dog for the whole length of her mouth . He shook his head . “
106219	106279	106280	106280	Mother	445	” She ground out words between her closed teeth . He could not hear what she said ; but the look in her eyes interpreted it to be a curse,—if not as coarsely worded , as fell in intent as ever was uttered . And yet her heart leapt up light , to know he was her own again . “
106282	106288	106280	106280	Mother	445	” said he , hurriedly , “
106321	106322	106316	106316	her	5377	” “
106328	106339	106324	106324	I	0	” said Mrs. Thornton , in a low fierce voice . “
106430	106431	106427	106427	I	0	” “
106511	106512	106506	106506	us	2871	” “
106540	106585	106595	106595	mother	445	” He stood still , gazing into the fire for a minute or two longer . Her dry dim eyes filled with unwonted tears as she looked at him ; but she seemed just as grim and quiet as usual when he next spoke . “
106607	106680	106595	106595	mother	445	” And Margaret ’s name was no more mentioned between Mrs. Thornton and her son . They fell back into their usual mode of talk,—about facts , not opinions , far less feelings . Their voices and tones were calm and cold ; a stranger might have gone away and thought that he had never seen such frigid indifference of demeanour between such near relations . CHAPTER XXVII . FRUIT - PIECE . “
106695	107067	107068	107068	I	0	” MIDSUMMER NIGHT ’S DREAM . Mr. Thornton went straight and clear into all the interests of the following day . There was a slight demand for finished goods ; and as it affected his branch of the trade , he took advantage of it , and drove hard bargains . He was sharp to the hour at the meeting of his brother magistrates,—giving them the best assistance of his strong sense , and his power of seeing consequences at a glance , and so coming to a rapid decision . Older men , men of long standing in the town , men of far greater wealth — realised and turned into land , while his was all floating capital , engaged in his trade — looked to him for prompt , ready wisdom . He was the one deputed to see and arrange with the police — to lead in all the requisite steps . And he cared for their unconscious deference no more than for the soft west wind , that scarcely made the smoke from the great tall chimneys swerve in its straight upward course . He was not aware of the silent respect paid to him . If it had been otherwise , he would have felt it as an obstacle in his progress to the object he had in view . As it was , he looked to the speedy accomplishment of that alone . It was his mother ’s greedy ears that sucked in , from the womenkind of these magistrates and wealthy men , how highly Mr. This or Mr. That thought of Mr. Thornton : that if he had not been there , things would have gone on very differently,—very badly , indeed . He swept off his business right and left that day . It seemed as though his deep mortification of yesterday , and the stunned purposeless course of the hours afterwards , had cleared away all the mists from his intellect . He felt his power and revelled in it . He could almost defy his heart . If he had known it , he could have sang the song of the miller who lived by the river Dee : — “
107078	107280	107073	107073	Nobody	1942	” The evidence against Boucher , and other ring - leaders of the riot , was taken before him : that against the three others , for conspiracy , failed . But he sternly charged the police to be on the watch ; for the swift right arm of the law should be in readiness to strike , as soon as they could prove a fault . And then he left the hot reeking room in the borough court , and went out into the fresher , but still sultry street . It seemed as though he gave way all at once ; he was so languid that he could not control his thoughts ; they would wander to her : they would bring back the scene,—not of his repulse and rejection the day before , but the looks , the actions of the day before that . He went along the crowded streets mechanically , winding in and out among the people , but never seeing them,—almost sick with longing for that one half - hour — that one brief space of time when she clung to him , and her heart beat against his — to come once again . “

107579	107596	107577	107577	her	142	” Mr. Thornton was silent . The vaunted steadiness of pulse failed him for an instant . “
107604	107613	107602	107602	Doctor	2886	” he asked , in an altered voice . “
107639	107640	107602	107602	Doctor	2886	” “
107643	107652	107602	107602	Doctor	2886	” replied the Doctor , shaking his head . “
107684	107685	107686	107686	You	2886	” “
107702	107707	107698	107698	I	0	” replied Mr. Thornton . “
107713	107714	107711	107711	you	2886	” “
107752	107828	107734	107734	you	2886	” But Mr. Thornton had no general benevolence,—no universal philanthropy ; few even would have given him credit for strong affections . But he went straight to the first fruit - shop in Milton , and chose out the bunch of purple grapes with the most delicate bloom upon them,—the richest - coloured peaches,—the freshest vine - leaves . They were packed into a basket , and the shopman awaited the answer to his inquiry , “
107838	107844	107831	107831	we	2896	” There was no reply . “
107854	107855	107852	107852	sir	5140	” “
107858	107863	107852	107852	sir	5140	” Mr. Thornton said . “
107872	107934	107868	107868	me,—I’ll	2901	” It took up both his hands to carry it ; and he had to pass through the busiest part of the town for feminine shopping . Many a young lady of his acquaintance turned to look after him , and thought it strange to see him occupied just like a porter or an errand - boy . He was thinking , “
108025	108165	108166	108166	I	0	” He went at an unusual pace , and was soon at Crampton . He went upstairs two steps at a time , and entered the drawing - room before Dixon could announce him,—his face flushed , his eyes shining with kindly earnestness . Mrs. Hale lay on the sofa , heated with fever . Mr. Hale was reading aloud . Margaret was working on a low stool by her mother ’s side . Her heart fluttered , if his did not at this interview . But he took no notice of her,—hardly of Mr. Hale himself ; he went up straight with his basket to Mrs. Hale , and said , in that subdued and gentle tone , which is so touching when used by a robust man in full health , speaking to a feeble invalid , — “
108204	108228	108175	108175	he	253	” Mrs. Hale was excessively pleased ; quite in a tremble of eagerness . Mr. Hale with fewer words expressed a deeper gratitude . “
108240	108337	108338	108338	I	0	” Margaret stood up by the table , half afraid of moving or making any noise to arouse Mr. Thornton into a consciousness of her being in the room . She thought it would be awkward for both to be brought into conscious collision : and fancied that , from her being on a low seat at first , and now standing behind her father , he had overlooked her in his haste . As if he did not feel the consciousness of her presence all over , though his eyes had never rested on her ! “
108342	108346	108338	108338	I	0	” said he , “
108408	108470	108406	108406	ma’am	5530	” He was gone . Not one word : not one look to Margaret . She believed that he had not seen her . She went for a plate in silence , and lifted the fruit out tenderly , with the points of her delicate taper fingers . It was good of him to bring it ; and after yesterday too ! “
108478	108488	108406	108406	ma’am	5530	” said Mrs. Hale , in a feeble voice . “
108513	108514	108511	108511	him	0	” “
108517	108523	108524	108524	Margaret	123	” said Margaret , quietly . “
108526	108534	108524	108524	Margaret	123	” said Mrs. Hale , rather querulously , “
108551	108576	108547	108547	anybody	591	” Mr. Hale had been peeling a peach for his wife ; and , cutting off a small piece for himself , he said : “
108665	108810	108649	108649	Margaret	123	” Did she not ? Did she not remember every weather - stain on the old stone wall ; the gray and yellow lichens that marked it like a map ; the little crane’s - bill that grew in the crevices ? She had been shaken by the events of the last two days ; her whole life just now was a strain upon her fortitude ; and , somehow , these careless words of her father ’s , touching on the remembrance of the sunny times of old , made her start up , and , dropping her sewing on the ground , she went hastily out of the room into her own little chamber . She had hardly given way to the first choking sob , when she became aware of Dixon standing at her drawers , and evidently searching for something . “
108834	108835	108827	108827	she	2915	” “
108868	108915	108860	108860	I	0	” Dixon did not speak , but went on rummaging . The scent of lavender came out and perfumed the room . At last Dixon found what she wanted ; what it was Margaret could not see . Dixon faced round , and spoke to her : “
108964	108965	108944	108944	I	0	” “
108981	108982	108976	108976	Dixon	186	” “
108995	108996	108991	108991	Higgins	204	” “
108999	109000	108991	108991	Higgins	204	” “
109067	109068	109050	109050	I	0	” “
109076	109087	109072	109072	me	0	” said Margaret , in the midst of her tears . “
109101	109102	109091	109091	I	0	” “
109127	109128	109110	109112	This girl downstairs	2920	” “
109134	109143	109130	109130	she	2916	” said Margaret , turning a little pale . “
109158	109159	109160	109160	I	0	” “
109181	109182	109174	109174	I	0	” “
109192	109243	109183	109183	I	0	” said Margaret , afraid lest Dixon ’s harshness of manner might wound the poor girl . So , taking the cap in her hand , she went to the kitchen . Mary ’s face was all swollen with crying , and she burst out afresh when she saw Margaret . “
109262	109359	109367	109367	she	2916	” And for a long time , Margaret could not get her to say anything more than this . At last , her sympathy , and Dixon ’s scolding , forced out a few facts . Nicholas Higgins had gone out in the morning , leaving Bessy as well as on the day before . But in an hour she was taken worse ; some neighbour ran to the room where Mary was working ; they did not know where to find her father ; Mary had only come in a few minutes before she died . “
109451	109459	109438	109438	She	2916	” Margaret shrank a little from answering . “
109485	109498	109483	109483	Mary	178	” Mary shook her head , and stood up to be going . “
109502	109511	109483	109483	Mary	178	” said Dixon , in a low voice , “
109583	109591	109592	109592	I	0	” said she , turning sharply round , “
109616	109668	109606	109606	she	5516	” The girl looked wistfully at Margaret . Dixon ’s coming might be a compliment , but it was not the same thing to the poor sister , who had had her little pangs of jealousy , during Bessy ’s lifetime , at the intimacy between her and the young lady . “
109673	109679	109671	109671	Dixon	186	” said Margaret with decision . “
109693	109726	109684	109684	Mary	178	” And for fear of her own cowardice , she went away , in order to take from herself any chance of changing her determination . CHAPTER XXVIII . COMFORT IN SORROW . “
109766	109769	109762	109762	Christ	290	” KOSEGARTEN . “
109805	109940	109941	109941	They	2937	” MRS . BROWNING . That afternoon she walked swiftly to the Higgins ’s house . Mary was looking out for her , with a half - distrustful face . Margaret smiled into her eyes to re - assure her . They passed quickly through the house - place , upstairs , and into the quiet presence of the dead . Then Margaret was glad that she had come . The face , so often weary with pain , so restless with troublous thoughts , had now the faint soft smile of eternal rest upon it . The slow tears gathered into Margaret ’s eyes , but a deep calm entered into her soul . And that was death ! It looked more peaceful than life . All beautiful scriptures came into her mind . “
109947	109948	109941	109941	They	2937	” “
109955	109956	109957	109957	He	2939	” “
109963	110084	109957	109957	He	2939	” Slowly , slowly Margaret turned away from the bed . Mary was humbly sobbing in the back - ground . They went downstairs without a word . Resting his hand upon the house - table , Nicholas Higgins stood in the midst of the floor ; his great eyes startled open by the news he had heard , as he came along the court , from many busy tongues . His eyes were dry and fierce ; studying the reality of her death ; bringing himself to understand that her place should know her no more . For she had been sickly , dying so long , that he had persuaded himself she would not die ; that she would “
110088	110231	109957	109957	He	2939	” Margaret felt as if she had no business to be there , familiarly acquainting herself with the surroundings of death , which he , the father , had only just learnt . There had been a pause of an instant on the steep crooked stair , when she first saw him ; but now she tried to steal past his abstracted gaze , and to leave him in the solemn circle of his household misery . Mary sat down on the first chair she came to , and throwing her apron over her head , began to cry . The noise appeared to rouse him . He took sudden hold of Margaret ’s arm , and held her till he could gather words to speak . His throat seemed dry ; they came up thick , and choked , and hoarse : “
110245	110246	110239	110239	yo	2940	” “
110249	110284	110239	110239	yo	2940	” replied Margaret , standing still with the utmost patience , now she found herself perceived . It was some time before he spoke again , but he kept his hold on her arm . “
110290	110330	110285	110286	All men	2070	” said he at last , with a strange sort of gravity , which first suggested to Margaret the idea that he had been drinking — not enough to intoxicate himself , but enough to make his thoughts bewildered . “
110338	110373	110332	110332	she	2941	” Still he pondered over the event , not looking at Margaret , though he grasped her tight . Suddenly , he looked up at her with a wild searching inquiry in his glance . “
110398	110399	110390	110390	she	2941	” “
110404	110437	110438	110438	She	2941	” replied Margaret . She felt no fear in speaking to him , though he hurt her arm with his gripe , and wild gleams came across the stupidity of his eyes . “
110442	110511	110438	110438	She	2941	” she said . He looked at her still with that searching look , which seemed to fade out of his eyes as he gazed . Then he suddenly let go his hold of Margaret , and , throwing his body half across the table , he shook it and every piece of furniture in the room , with his violent sobs . Mary came trembling towards him . “
110518	110529	110438	110438	She	2941	” he cried , striking wildly and blindly at her . “
110537	110663	110438	110438	She	2941	” Margaret took her hand and held it softly in hers . He tore his hair , he beat his head against the hard wood , then he lay exhausted and stupid . Still his daughter and Margaret did not move . Mary trembled from head to foot . At last — it might have been a quarter of an hour , it might have been an hour — he lifted himself up . His eyes were swollen and bloodshot , and he seemed to have forgotten that any one was by ; he scowled at the watchers when he saw them . He shook himself heavily , gave them one more sullen look , spoke never a word , but made for the door . “
110670	110678	110668	110668	father	5264	” said Mary , throwing herself upon his arm,—“not
110739	110758	110725	110725	She	2947	” But Margaret stood in the doorway , silent yet commanding . He looked up at her defyingly . “
110781	110861	110775	110775	I	0	” He had shaken off Mary with violence ; he looked ready to strike Margaret . But she never moved a feature — never took her deep , serious eyes off him . He stared back on her with gloomy fierceness . If she had stirred hand or foot , he would have thrust her aside with even more violence than he had used to his own daughter , whose face was bleeding from her fall against a chair . “
110874	110888	110864	110864	yo	314	” asked he at last , daunted and awed by her severe calm . “
110945	111014	110935	110935	he	2953	” Margaret felt that he acknowledged her power . What could she do next ? He had seated himself on a chair , close to the door ; half - conquered half - resenting ; intending to go out as soon as she left her position , but unwilling to use the violence he had threatened not five minutes before . Margaret laid her hand on his arm . “
111019	111023	111017	111017	me	0	” she said . “
111029	111119	111120	111120	Her	2954	” The voice in which she spoke was very low and solemn ; but there was no fear or doubt expressed in it , either of him or of his compliance . He sullenly rose up . He stood uncertain , with dogged irresolution upon his face . She waited him there ; quietly and patiently waited for his time to move . He had a strange pleasure in making her wait ; but at last he moved towards the stairs . She and he stood by the corpse . “
111136	111137	111120	111120	Her	2954	” “
111144	111148	111120	111120	Her	2954	” muttered he . “
111155	111170	111171	111171	We	2956	” Then , raising his voice to a wailing cry , he went on : “
111285	111286	111269	111269	I	0	” “
111289	111299	111269	111269	I	0	” said Margaret , softening with his softened manner . “
111352	111376	111331	111331	her	2954	” He shook his head , glancing sideways up at Margaret as he did so . His pale haggard face struck her painfully . “
111393	111394	111384	111384	you	2949	” “
111402	111413	111384	111384	you	2949	” said he , with a short , grim laugh . “
111596	111607	111608	111608	I	0	” turning to the poor dumb form with wild appeal . “
111612	111616	111608	111608	I	0	” said Margaret , “
111668	111683	111663	111663	You	0	” No answer . In fact , where was he to look for comfort ? “
111689	111711	111663	111663	You	0	” said she at last , with a bold venture , half trembling at her own proposal as she made it . “
111728	111729	111730	111731	Yo’r father	2972	” “
111736	111748	111749	111749	He	2972	” asked he , with a sudden turn in his ideas . “
111752	111758	111749	111749	He	2972	” said Margaret , shortly . “
111807	111900	111792	111792	I	0	” Margaret was perplexed ; his drinking tea with her father , who would be totally unprepared for his visitor — her mother so ill — seemed utterly out of the question ; and yet , if she drew back now , it would be worse than ever — sure to drive him to the gin - shop . She thought that if she could only get him to their own house , it was so great a step gained that she would trust to the chapter of accidents for the next . “
111965	112129	112130	112130	I	0	” He stooped down and fondly kissed his daughter ; covered up her face , and turned to follow Margaret . She had hastily gone down stairs to tell Mary of the arrangement ; to say it was the only place she could think of to keep him from the gin - palace ; to urge Mary to come too , for her heart smote her at the idea of leaving the poor affectionate girl alone . But Mary had friends amongst the neighbours , she said , who would come in and sit a bit with her ; it was all right ; but father — He was there by them or she would have spoken more . He had shaken off his emotion , as if he was ashamed of having ever given way to it ; and had even o’erleaped himself so much that he assumed a sort of bitter mirth , like the crackling of thorns under a pot . “
112145	112235	112142	112142	I	0	” But he slouched his cap low down over his brow as he went out into the street , and looked neither to the right nor to the left , while he tramped along by Margaret ’s side ; he feared being upset by the words , still more the looks , of sympathising neighbours . So he and Margaret walked in silence . As he got near the street in which he knew she lived , he looked down at his clothes , his hands , his shoes . “
112247	112341	112236	112236	I	0	” It certainly would have been desirable , but Margaret assured him he should be allowed to go into the yard , and have soap and towel provided ; she would not let him slip out of her hands just then . While he followed the house - servant along the passage , and through the kitchen , stepping cautiously on every dark mark in the pattern of the oil - cloth , in order to conceal his dirty foot - prints , Margaret ran upstairs . She met Dixon on the landing . “
112348	112448	112142	112142	I	0	” Missus was tired , and gone into her own room . She had wanted to go to bed , but Dixon had persuaded her to lie down on the sofa , and have her tea brought to her there ; it would be better than getting restless by being too long in bed . So far , so good . But where was Mr. Hale ? In the drawing - room . Margaret went in half breathless with the hurried story she had to tell . Of course , she told it incompletely ; and her father was rather “
112451	112579	112582	112582	papa	528	” by the idea of the drunken weaver awaiting him in his quiet study , with whom he was expected to drink tea , and on whose behalf Margaret was anxiously pleading . The meek , kind - hearted Mr. Hale would have readily tried to console him in his grief , but , unluckily , the point Margaret dwelt upon most forcibly was the fact of his having been drinking , and her having brought him home with her as a last expedient to keep him from the gin - shop . One little event had come out of another so naturally that Margaret was hardly conscious of what she had done , till she saw the slight look of repugnance on her father ’s face . “
112604	112605	112595	112595	you	528	” “
112623	112629	112630	112630	I	0	” Margaret ’s countenance fell . “
112668	112695	112648	112648	He	528	” Margaret ’s eyes filled with tears . Mr. Hale took hold of her sweet pleading face in both his hands , and kissed her forehead . “
112743	112744	112750	112750	you	0	” “
112752	112767	112768	112768	Papa	139	” But as Mr. Hale was leaving the room , she ran after him . “
112797	112798	112787	112787	he	528	” “
112807	112824	112787	112787	he	528	” said Mr. Hale to himself , in dismay . But to Margaret he only said , “
112838	112856	112787	112787	he	528	” Margaret went into her mother ’s room . Mrs. Hale lifted herself up from a doze . “
112873	112874	112859	112859	you	5155	” “
112879	112880	112859	112859	you	5155	” “
112888	112889	112877	112877	mamma	5139	” “
112897	112898	112892	112892	I	0	” “
112957	112958	112961	112961	mamma	5139	” “
113079	113080	113081	113081	They	3006	” “
113092	113104	113086	113086	they	3006	” said Dixon , showing her teeth at the bare idea . “
113120	113121	113122	113123	Poor fellow	5622	” “
113125	113130	113122	113123	Poor fellow	5622	” echoed Mrs. Hale . “
113155	113156	113157	113157	I	0	” “
113165	113191	113163	113163	mamma	5139	” said Margaret , remembering the urgency with which she had entreated him to come directly , if he wished to see his mother alive . “
113203	113212	113163	113163	mamma	5139	” said Mrs. Hale . Margaret was silent . “
113218	113229	113216	113216	ma’am	5530	” said Dixon , with a kind of cheerful authority , “
113395	113461	113464	113464	you	3016	” Mrs. Hale did trust in Dixon more than in Margaret . Dixon ’s words quieted her for the time . Margaret poured out the tea in silence , trying to think of something agreeable to say ; but her thoughts made answer something like Daniel O’Rourke , when the man - in - the moon asked him to get off his reaping - hook . “
113475	113729	113730	113731	Mr. Higgins	333	” The more she tried to think of something — anything besides the danger to which Frederick would be exposed — the more closely her imagination clung to the unfortunate idea presented to her . Her mother prattled with Dixon , and seemed to have utterly forgotten the possibility of Frederick being tried and executed — utterly forgotten that at her wish , if by Margaret ’s deed , he was summoned into this danger . Her mother was one of those who throw out terrible possibilities , miserable probabilities , unfortunate chances of all kinds , as a rocket throws out sparks ; but if the sparks light on some combustible matter , they smoulder first , and burst out into a frightful flame at last . Margaret was glad when , her filial duties gently and carefully performed , she could go down into the study . She wondered how her father and Higgins had got on . In the first place , the decorous , kind - hearted , simple , old - fashioned gentleman , had unconsciously called out , by his own refinement and courteousness of manner , all the latent courtesy in the other . Mr. Hale treated all his fellow - creatures alike : it never entered into his head to make any difference because of their rank . He placed a chair for Nicholas ; stood up till he , at Mr. Hale ’s request , took a seat ; and called him , invariably , “
113733	113738	113739	113739	Nicholas	202	” instead of the curt “
113740	113742	113743	113743	Higgins	202	” or “
113745	113749	113743	113743	Higgins	202	” to which the “
113753	113890	113743	113743	Higgins	202	” had been accustomed . But Nicholas was neither an habitual drunkard nor a thorough infidel . He drank to drown care , as he would have himself expressed it : and he was infidel so far as he had never yet found any form of faith to which he could attach himself , heart and soul . Margaret was a little surprised , and very much pleased , when she found her father and Higgins in earnest conversation — each speaking with gentle politeness to the other , however their opinions might clash . Nicholas — clean , tidied ( if only at the pump - trough ) , and quiet spoken — was a new creature to her , who had only seen him in the rough independence of his own hearthstone . He had “
113892	114041	114043	114043	I	0	” his hair down with the fresh water ; he had adjusted his neck - handkerchief , and borrowed an odd candle - end to polish his clogs with ; and there he sat , enforcing some opinion on her father , with a strong Darkshire accent , it is true , but with a lowered voice , and a good , earnest composure on his face . Her father , too , was interested in what his companion was saying . He looked round as she came in , smiled , and quietly gave her his chair , and then sat down afresh as quickly as possible , and with a little bow of apology to his guest for the interruption . Higgins nodded to her as a sign of greeting ; and she softly adjusted her working materials on the table , and prepared to listen . “
114500	114501	114503	114504	the masters	1687	” “
114544	114545	114546	114546	I	0	” “
114552	114564	114566	114566	yo	5140	” said Higgins , with a curious wink of his eye , “
114689	114690	114684	114684	I	0	” “
114773	114781	114762	114762	I	0	believe”—(Mr . Hale ’s voice dropped low in reverence)—“you
114786	114830	114831	114831	Man	633	” Nicholas Higgins suddenly stood straight , stiff up . Margaret started to her feet,—for she thought , by the working of his face , he was going into convulsions . Mr. Hale looked at her dismayed . At last Higgins found words : “
114908	114927	114899	114899	I	0	” said he , sitting down , and drearily going on , as if to the unsympathising fire . “
115118	115141	115142	115142	Nicholas	202	” — — Margaret touched his arm very softly . She had not spoken before , nor had he heard her rise . “
115179	115188	115167	115167	you	202	” He turned round and caught her hand . “
115195	115204	115167	115167	you	202	is”—(brushing away the tears with the back of his hand).—“But
115337	115358	115359	115359	He	0	” Mr. Hale blew his nose , and got up to snuff the candles in order to conceal his emotion . “
115373	115378	115379	115379	I	0	” muttered he reproachfully . “
115393	115394	115398	115398	papa	528	” “
115433	115570	115571	115571	them	3075	” So they questioned and listened . The workmen ’s calculations were based ( like too many of the masters ’ ) on false premises . They reckoned on their fellow - men as if they possessed the calculable powers of machines , no more , no less ; no allowance for human passions getting the better of reason , as in the case of Boucher and the rioters ; and believing that the representations of their injuries would have the same effect on strangers far away , as the injuries ( fancied or real ) had upon themselves . They were consequently surprised and indignant at the poor Irish , who had allowed themselves to be imported and brought over to take their places . This indignation was tempered in some degree , by contempt for “
115574	115668	115571	115571	them	3075	” and by pleasure at the idea of the bungling way in which they would set to work , and perplex their new masters with their ignorance and stupidity , strange exaggerated stories of which were already spreading through the town . But the most cruel cut of all was that of the Milton workmen , who had defied and disobeyed the commands of the Union to keep the peace , whatever came ; who had originated discord in the camp , and spread the panic of the law being arrayed against them . “
115678	115682	115685	115685	miss	5091	” said Margaret . “
115762	115763	115764	115764	You	3082	” “
115773	115777	115771	115771	you	3082	” asked Margaret . “
115788	115789	115786	115786	you	3082	” “
115813	115825	115799	115799	he	334	” said Nicholas , quietly . Margaret was silenced and sad . “
115830	115835	115799	115799	he	334	” said Mr. Hale . “
115865	115875	115876	115876	Yo	3082	” He got up and went to his bookshelves . “
115886	115890	115884	115884	sir	5140	” said Nicholas . “
116387	116388	116382	116382	they	806	” “
116394	116399	116382	116382	they	806	” said Mr. Hale , “
116486	116487	116490	116490	sir	5140	” “
116492	116499	116490	116490	sir	5140	” said Higgins , rather doggedly ; “
116835	116836	116815	116815	he	281	” “
116918	116923	116953	116953	he	179	wonder”—(half to his daughter ) “
116936	116937	116925	116926	Mr. Thornton	179	” “
116942	116951	116953	116953	he	179	” said she in a very low voice , “
116962	117036	116953	116953	he	179	” She was unwilling to make any clearer allusion to the conversation they had held on the mode of governing work - people — by giving men intelligence enough to rule themselves , or by a wise despotism on the part of the master — for she saw that Higgins had caught Mr. Thornton ’s name , if not the whole of the speech : indeed , he began to speak of him . “
117263	117264	117265	117266	Mr. Thornton	179	” “
117270	117274	117265	117266	Mr. Thornton	179	” said Margaret . “
117315	117316	117317	117317	My	0	” “
117328	117353	117317	117317	My	0	” said Mr. Hale , smiling at Margaret ; while she , as red as any carnation , began to work with double diligence , “
117370	117371	117364	117364	I	0	” “
117426	117427	117428	117428	You	5140	” “
117431	117435	117428	117428	You	5140	” said Margaret . “
117472	117473	117457	117457	he	262	” “
117506	117507	117499	117499	He	262	” “
117515	117520	117521	117521	You	5140	” asked Margaret innocently . “
117541	117563	117521	117521	You	5140	” Higgins ’s brow clouded . He was silent for a minute or two . Then he said , shortly enough : “
117618	117688	117595	117595	they	3152	” Mr. Hale saw that Higgins was vexed at the turn the conversation had taken , and was silent . Not so Margaret , though she saw Higgins ’s feeling as clearly as he did . By instinct she felt that if he could but be brought to express himself in plain words , something clear would be gained on which to argue for the right and the just . “
117699	117738	117595	117595	they	3152	” He looked up at her , as if on the point of dogged resistance to her wish for information . But her calm face , fixed on his , patient and trustful , compelled him to answer . “
117964	117965	117955	117955	yo’ll	3158	” “
117968	117972	117955	117955	yo’ll	3158	” said Margaret , “
118053	118054	118044	118044	you	202	” “
118057	118061	118062	118062	yo	3158	” said Higgins , “
118293	118294	118349	118349	I	0	” “
118297	118304	118349	118349	I	0	” said Mr. Hale , sighing , “
118347	118348	118349	118349	I	0	” “
118362	118372	118360	118360	sir	5140	” said Higgins , as the clock struck ten . “
118375	118391	118360	118360	sir	5140	” said Margaret very softly . He understood her , and took her offered hand . “
118413	118414	118415	118415	I	0	” “
118424	118425	118422	118422	Nicholas	202	” “
118428	118438	118439	118440	Mr. Higgins	333	” said Mr. Hale , hurrying to the bookshelves . “
118453	118521	118442	118442	I	0	” Higgins looked at Margaret , doubtfully . Her grave sweet eyes met his ; there was no compulsion , only deep interest in them . He did not speak , but he kept his place . Margaret the Churchwoman , her father the Dissenter , Higgins the Infidel , knelt down together . It did them no harm . CHAPTER XXIX . A RAY OF SUNSHINE . “
118563	118619	118622	118622	Margaret	123	” COLERIDGE . The next morning brought Margaret a letter from Edith . It was affectionate and inconsequent like the writer . But the affection was charming to Margaret ’s own affectionate nature ; and she had grown up with the inconsequence , so she did not perceive it . It was as follows : — “
119117	119145	119151	119151	he	6444	uncle”—(Here the letter became more constrained , and better written . Mr. Hale was in the corner , like a naughty child , for having given up his living.)—“because
119461	119628	119458	119459	King Herod	341	” Margaret did long for a day of Edith ’s life — her freedom from care , her cheerful home , her sunny skies . If a wish could have transported her , she would have gone off ; just for one day . She yearned for the strength which such a change would give — even for a few hours to be in the midst of that bright life , and to feel young again . Not yet twenty ! and she had had to bear up against such hard pressure that she felt quite old . That was her first feeling after reading Edith ’s letter . Then she read it again , and , forgetting herself , was amused at its likeness to Edith ’s self , and was laughing merrily over it when Mrs. Hale came into the drawing - room , leaning on Dixon ’s arm . Margaret flew to adjust the pillows . Her mother seemed more than usually feeble . “
119637	119657	119631	119631	you	3219	” asked she , as soon as she had recovered from the exertion of settling herself on the sofa . “
119677	119875	119675	119675	mamma	5139	” She read it aloud , and for a time it seemed to interest her mother , who kept wondering what name Edith had given to her boy , and suggesting all probable names , and all possible reasons why each and all of these names should be given . Into the very midst of these wonders Mr. Thornton came , bringing another offering of fruit for Mrs. Hale . He could not — say rather , he would not — deny himself the chance of the pleasure of seeing Margaret . He had no end in this but the present gratification . It was the sturdy wilfulness of a man usually most reasonable and self - controlled . He entered the room , taking in at a glance the fact of Margaret ’s presence ; but after the first cold distant bow , he never seemed to let his eyes fall on her again . He only stayed to present his peaches — to speak some gentle kindly words — and then his cold offended eyes met Margaret ’s with a grave farewell , as he left the room . She sat down silent and pale . “
119890	119902	119904	119904	you	3221	” No answer at first . Then Margaret forced out an icy “
119906	119907	119904	119904	you	3221	” “
119922	119935	119936	119936	He	179	” Margaret ’s voice was more in order now . She replied , “
119950	119951	119936	119936	He	179	” “
119973	119974	119959	119959	She	216	” “
119988	119989	119979	119979	she	216	” “
120008	120045	120006	120006	Margaret	123	” Margaret felt what was in her mother ’s thoughts — a tender craving to bespeak the kindness of some woman towards the daughter that might soon be left motherless . But she could not speak . “
120050	120059	120047	120047	you	0	” said Mrs. Hale , after a pause , “
120085	120086	120087	120087	I	0	” “

120221	120222	120200	120200	I	0	” “
120234	120235	120200	120200	I	0	” “
120266	120267	120268	120268	Dixon	186	” “
120350	120351	120353	120353	you	0	” “
120402	120403	120406	120406	mamma	5139	” “
120419	120425	120426	120426	Edith	131	” said Margaret , laughing . “
120448	120449	120439	120440	aunt Shaw	131	” “
120456	120457	120451	120451	yours	3239	” “

120560	120561	120562	120562	I	0	” “
120569	120574	120575	120575	Edith	131	” said Mrs. Hale . “
120592	120680	120575	120575	Edith	131	” Margaret started up as her mother said this . Her father had just entered the room , and she was most anxious that the faint impression she had seen on his mind that the Milton air had injured her mother ’s health , should not be deepened — should not receive any confirmation . She could not tell whether he had heard what Mrs. Hale had said or not ; but she began speaking hurriedly of other things , unaware that Mr. Thornton was following him . “
120700	120702	120681	120681	Mamma	163	” The “
120704	120789	120792	120793	Mr. Thornton	179	” Margaret spoke of , referred purely to the use of local words , and the expression arose out of the conversation they had just been holding . But Mr. Thornton ’s brow darkened ; and Margaret suddenly felt how her speech might be misunderstood by him ; so , in the natural sweet desire to avoid giving unnecessary pain , she forced herself to go forwards with a little greeting , and continue what she was saying , addressing herself to him expressly . “
120844	121431	120839	120839	I	0	” It was unusual with Margaret to obtrude her own subject of conversation on others ; but , in this case , she was so anxious to prevent Mr. Thornton from feeling annoyance at the words he had accidentally overheard , that it was not until she had done speaking that she coloured all over with consciousness , more especially as Mr. Thornton seemed hardly to understand the exact gist or bearing of what she was saying , but passed her by , with a cold reserve of ceremonious movement , to speak to Mrs. Hale . The sight of him reminded her of the wish to see his mother , and commend Margaret to her care . Margaret , sitting in burning silence , vexed and ashamed of her difficulty in keeping her right place , and her calm unconsciousness of heart , when Mr. Thornton was by , heard her mother ’s slow entreaty that Mrs. Thornton would come and see her ; see her soon ; to - morrow , if it were possible . Mr. Thornton promised that she should — conversed a little , and then took his leave ; and Margaret ’s movements and voice seemed at once released from some invisible chains . He never looked at her ; and yet , the careful avoidance of his eyes betokened that in some way he knew exactly where , if they fell by chance , they would rest on her . If she spoke , he gave no sign of attention , and yet his next speech to any one else was modified by what she had said ; sometimes there was an express answer to what she had remarked , but given to another person as though unsuggested by her . It was not the bad manners of ignorance ; it was the wilful bad manners arising from deep offence . It was wilful at the time ; repented of afterwards . But no deep plan , no careful cunning could have stood him in such good stead . Margaret thought about him more than she had ever done before ; not with any tinge of what is called love , but with regret that she had wounded him so deeply,—and with a gentle , patient striving to return to their former position of antagonistic friendship ; for a friend ’s position was what she found that he had held in her regard , as well as in that of the rest of the family . There was a pretty humility in her behaviour to him , as if mutely apologising for the over - strong words which were the reaction from the deeds of the day of the riot . But he resented those words bitterly . They rung in his ears ; and he was proud of the sense of justice which made him go in every kindness he could offer to her parents . He exulted in the power he showed in compelling himself to face her , whenever he could think of any action which might give her father or mother pleasure . He thought that he disliked seeing one who had mortified him so keenly ; but he was mistaken . It was a stinging pleasure to be in the room with her , and feel her presence . But he was no great analyser of his own motives and was mistaken , as I have said . CHAPTER XXX . HOME AT LAST . “
121441	121444	120839	120839	I	0	” SOUTHWELL . “
121474	122023	122024	122024	Margaret	123	” MRS . HEMANS . Mrs. Thornton came to see Mrs. Hale the next morning . She was much worse . One of those sudden changes — those great visible strides towards death , had been taken in the night , and her own family were startled by the gray sunken look her features had assumed in that one twelve hours of suffering . Mrs. Thornton — who had not seen her for weeks — was softened all at once . She had come because her son asked it from her as a personal favour , but with all the proud bitter feelings of her nature in arms against that family of which Margaret formed one . She doubted the reality of Mrs. Hale ’s illness ; she doubted any want beyond a momentary fancy on that lady ’s part , which should take her out of her previously settled course of employment for the day . She told her son that she wished they had never come near the place ; that he had never got acquainted with them ; that there had been no such useless languages as Latin and Greek ever invented . He bore all this pretty silently ; but when she had ended her invective against the dead languages , he quietly returned to the short , curt , decided expression of his wish that she should go and see Mrs. Hale at the time appointed , as most likely to be convenient to the invalid . Mrs. Thornton submitted with as bad a grace as she could to her son ’s desire , all the time liking him the better for having it ; and exaggerating in her own mind the same notion that he had of extraordinary goodness on his part in so perseveringly keeping up with the Hales . His goodness verging on weakness ( as all the softer virtues did in her mind ) , and her own contempt for Mr. and Mrs. Hale , and positive dislike to Margaret , were the ideas which occupied Mrs. Thornton , till she was struck into nothingness before the dark shadow of the wings of the angel of death . There lay Mrs. Hale — a mother like herself — a much younger woman than she was,—on the bed from which there was no sign of hope that she might ever rise again . No more variety of light and shade for her in that darkened room ; no power of action , scarcely change of movement ; faint alternations of whispered sound and studious silence ; and yet that monotonous life seemed almost too much ! When Mrs. Thornton , strong and prosperous with life , came in , Mrs. Hale lay still , although from the look on her face she was evidently conscious of who it was . But she did not even open her eyes for a minute or two . The heavy moisture of tears stood on her eyelashes before she looked up ; then , with her hand groping feebly over the bed - clothes , for the touch of Mrs. Thornton ’s large firm fingers , she said , scarcely above her breath.—Mrs . Thornton had to stoop from her erectness to listen , — “
122052	122190	122051	122051	you	123	” — — And her filmy wandering eyes fixed themselves with an intensity of wistfulness on Mrs. Thornton ’s face . For a minute there was no change in its rigidness ; it was stern and unmoved;—nay , but that the eyes of the sick woman were growing dim with the slow - gathering tears , she might have seen a dark cloud cross the cold features . And it was no thought of her son , or of her living daughter Fanny , that stirred her heart at last ; but a sudden remembrance , suggested by something in the arrangement of the room,—of a little daughter — dead in infancy — long years ago — that , like a sudden sunbeam , melted the icy crust , behind which there was a real tender woman . “
122202	122260	122191	122191	You	123	” said Mrs. Thornton , in her measured voice , that would not soften with her heart , but came out distinct and clear . Mrs. Hale , her eyes still fixed on Mrs. Thornton ’s face , pressed the hand that lay below hers on the coverlet . She could not speak . Mrs. Thornton sighed , “
122282	122285	122286	122286	she	3255	be,”—(“to her , ”
122305	122345	122295	122295	she	3255	face.)—“It is not my nature to show affection even where I feel it , nor do I volunteer advice in general . Still , at your request,—if it will be any comfort to you , I will promise you . ”
122394	122398	122400	122400	she	3255	“ I promise , ”
122431	122442	122400	122400	she	3255	“ I promise that in any difficulty in which Miss Hale ”
122445	122450	122452	122453	Mrs. Hale	142	“ Call her Margaret ! ”
122455	122498	122452	122453	Mrs. Hale	142	“ In which she comes to me for help , I will help her with every power I have , as if she were my own daughter . I also promise that if ever I see her doing what I think is wrong ”
122501	122512	122514	122515	Mrs. Hale	142	“ But Margaret never does wrong — not wilfully wrong , ”
122531	122588	122517	122518	Mrs. Thornton	216	“ If ever I see her doing what I believe to be wrong — such wrong not touching me or mine , in which case I might be supposed to have an interested motive — I will tell her of it , faithfully and plainly , as I should wish my own daughter to be told . ”
122679	122719	122673	122674	Mrs. Hale	142	“ I thank you . I pray God to bless you . I shall never see you again in this world . But my last words are , I thank you for your promise of kindness to my child . ”
122720	122724	122726	122727	Mrs. Thornton	216	“ Not kindness ! ”
123445	123452	123454	123454	he	940	“ Is this Mr. Hale ’s ? ”
123484	123487	123480	123480	she	123	“ Frederick ! ”
123503	123508	123510	123510	he	940	“ Oh , Margaret ! ”
123555	123563	123532	123532	he	940	“ My mother ! is she alive ! ”
123564	123594	123601	123601	he	940	“ Yes , she is alive , dear , dear brother ! She — as ill as she can be she is ; but alive ! She is alive ! ”
123595	123599	123601	123601	he	940	“ Thank God ! ”
123603	123613	123601	123601	he	940	“ Papa is utterly prostrate with this great grief . ”
123614	123623	123601	123601	he	940	“ You expect me , do n’t you ? ”
123624	123633	123601	123601	he	940	“ No , we have had no letter . ”
123634	123650	123601	123601	he	940	“ Then I have come before it . But my mother knows I am coming . ”
123651	123722	123723	123723	She	3285	“ Oh ! we all knew you would come . But wait a little ! Step in here . Give me your hand . What is this ? Oh ! your carpet - bag . Dixon has shut the shutters ; but this is papa ’s study , and I can take you to a chair to rest yourself for a few minutes ; while I go and tell him . ”
123936	123939	123941	123941	she	123	“ Papa , ”
123988	123996	123997	123997	He	1589	“ Papa ! guess who is here ! ”
124061	124093	124054	124054	she	123	“ I do n’t know ; do n’t tell me it is Frederick — not Frederick . I can not bear it,—I am too weak . And his mother is dying ! ”
124149	124190	124132	124132	she	123	“ Papa , it is Frederick ! Think of mamma , how glad she will be ! And oh , for her sake , how glad we ought to be ! For his sake , too,—our poor , poor boy ! ”
124210	124215	124217	124217	he	444	“ Where is he ? ”
124230	124261	124217	124217	he	444	“ In your study , quite alone . I lighted the taper , and ran up to tell you . He is quite alone , and will be wondering why — ”
124262	124269	124276	124276	he	444	“ I will go to him , ”
124676	124695	124671	124672	Mrs. Hale	142	“ Dixon says it is a gift to light a fire ; not an art to be acquired . ”
124696	124703	124705	124706	Mr. Hale	134	“ Poeta nascitur , non fit , ”
124723	124735	124737	124737	Frederick	159	“ Dear old Dixon ! How we shall kiss each other ! ”
124739	124831	124737	124737	Frederick	159	“ She used to kiss me , and then look in my face to be sure I was the right person , and then set to again ! But , Margaret , what a bungler you are ! I never saw such a little awkward , good - for - nothing pair of hands . Run away , and wash them , ready to cut bread - and - butter for me , and leave the fire . I ’ll manage it . Lighting fires is one of my natural accomplishments . ”
125103	125122	125099	125099	Margaret	123	“ I will go to her , and tell her . And I shall hear how mamma is . ”
125232	125236	125226	125226	Dixon	186	“ Master Frederick . ”
125936	125942	125944	125944	she	142	“ I am very selfish , ”
125946	125955	125944	125944	she	142	“ but it will not be for long . ”
126043	126050	126051	126051	he	159	“ I do n’t believe it , ”
126054	126115	126051	126051	he	159	“ She is very ill ; she may be dangerously ill , and in immediate danger , too ; but I ca n’t imagine that she could be as she is , if she were on the point of death . Margaret ! she should have some other advice — some London doctor . Have you never thought of that ? ”
126116	126119	126121	126121	Margaret	123	“ Yes , ”
126123	126180	126121	126121	Margaret	123	“ more than once . But I do n’t believe it would do any good . And , you know , we have not the money to bring any great London surgeon down , and I am sure Dr. Donaldson is only second in skill to the very best,—if , indeed , he is to them . ”
126192	126199	126201	126201	he	159	“ I have credit in Cadiz , ”
126203	126228	126201	126201	he	159	“ but none here , owing to this wretched change of name . Why did my father leave Helstone ? That was the blunder . ”
126229	126235	126237	126237	Margaret	123	“ It was no blunder , ”
126240	126300	126237	126237	Margaret	123	“ And above all possible chances , avoid letting papa hear anything like what you have just been saying . I can see that he is tormenting himself already with the idea that mamma would never have been ill if we had stayed at Helstone , and you do n’t know papa ’s agonising power of self - reproach ! ”
126335	126340	126342	126342	he	159	“ My little Margaret ! ”
126347	126397	126342	126342	he	159	“ Let us hope as long as we can . Poor little woman ! what ! is this face all wet with tears ? I will hope . I will , in spite of a thousand doctors . Bear up , Margaret , and be brave enough to hope ! ”
126414	126454	126407	126407	she	123	“ I must try to be meek enough to trust . Oh , Frederick ! mamma was getting to love me so ! And I was getting to understand her . And now comes death to snap us asunder ! ”
126455	126557	126407	126407	she	123	“ Come , come , come ! Let us go upstairs , and do something , rather than waste time that may be so precious . Thinking has , many a time , made me sad , darling ; but doing never did in all my life . My theory is a sort of parody on the maxim of ‘ Get money , my son , honestly if you can ; but get money . ’ My precept is , ‘ Do something my sister , do good if you can ; but , at any rate , do something . ’ ”
126558	126563	126565	126565	Margaret	123	“ Not excluding mischief , ”
126573	126664	126565	126565	Margaret	123	“ By no means . What I do exclude is the remorse afterwards . Blot your misdeeds out ( if you are particularly conscientious ) , by a good deed , as soon as you can ; just as we did a correct sum at school on the slate , where an incorrect one was only half rubbed out . It was better than wetting our sponge with our tears ; both less loss of time where tears had to be waited for , and a better effect at last . ”
127186	127192	127193	127193	he	444	head:—“Poor boy ! poor boy ! ”
127268	127276	127247	127247	Margaret	123	“ Let not your heart be troubled , ”
127296	127303	127281	127281	she	123	“ SHOULD AULD ACQUAINTANCE BE FORGOT . ”
127304	127326	127327	127327	CRABBE	344	“ Show not that manner , and these features all , The serpent ’s cunning , and the sinner ’s fall ? ”
127575	127722	127573	127573	Dixon	186	“ Come , Miss Hale — come , my dear ! You must not give way , or where shall we all be ? There is not another person in the house fit to give a direction of any kind , and there is so much to be done . There ’s who ’s to manage the funeral ; and who ’s to come to it ; and where it ’s to be ; and all to be settled : and Master Frederick ’s like one crazed with crying , and master never was a good one for settling ; and , poor gentleman , he goes about now as if he was lost . It ’s bad enough , my dear , I know ; but death comes to us all ; and you ’re well off never to have lost any friend till now . ”
128004	128009	128011	128011	he	134	“ Ask Mr. Bell , ”
128017	128021	128023	128023	she	123	“ Mr. Bell ! ”
128029	128035	128023	128023	she	123	“ Mr. Bell of Oxford ? ”
128036	128040	128041	128041	he	134	“ Mr. Bell , ”
128044	128054	128041	128041	he	134	“ Yes . He was my groom’s - man . ”
128060	128068	128070	128070	she	123	“ I will write to - day , ”
128104	128358	128099	128099	Dixon	186	“ I ’ve done it , miss . I was really afraid for master , that he ’d have a stroke with grief . He ’s been all this day with poor missus ; and when I ’ve listened at the door , I ’ve heard him talking to her , and talking to her , as if she was alive . When I went in he would be quite quiet , but all in a maze like . So I thought to myself , he ought to be roused ; and if it gives him a shock at first , it will , maybe , be the better for him afterwards . So I ’ve been and told him , that I do n’t think it ’s safe for Master Frederick to be here . And I do n’t . It was only on Tuesday , when I was out , that I met a Southampton man — the first I ’ve seen since I came to Milton ; they do n’t make their way much up here , I think . Well , it was young Leonards , old Leonards the draper ’s son , as great a scamp as ever lived — who plagued his father almost to death , and then ran off to sea . I never could abide him . He was in the Orion at the same time as Frederick , I know ; though I do n’t recollect if he was there at the mutiny . ”
128359	128365	128367	128367	Margaret	123	“ Did he know you ? ”
128371	128905	128367	128367	Margaret	123	“ Why , that ’s the worst of it . I do n’t believe he would have known me but for my being such a fool as to call out his name . He were a Southampton man , in a strange place , or else I should never have been so ready to call cousins with him , a nasty , good - for - nothing - fellow . Says he , ‘ Miss Dixon ! who would ha ’ thought of seeing you here ? But perhaps I mistake , and you ’re Miss Dixon no longer ? ’ So I told him he might still address me as an unmarried lady , though if I had n’t been so particular , I ’d had good chances of matrimony . He was polite enough : ‘ He could n’t look at me and doubt me . ’ But I were not to be caught with such chaff from such a fellow as him , and so I told him ; and , by way of being even , I asked him after his father ( who I knew had turned him out of doors ) , as if they were the best friends as ever was . So then , to spite me — for you see we were getting savage , for all we were so civil to each other — he began to inquire after Master Frederick , and said , what a scrape he ’d got into ( as if Master Frederick ’s scrapes would ever wash George Leonards white , or make ’em look otherwise than nasty , dirty black ) , and how he ’d be hung for mutiny if ever he were caught , and how a hundred pound reward had been offered for catching him , and what a disgrace he had been to his family — all to spite me , you see , my dear , because before now I ’ve helped old Mr. Leonards to give George a good rating , down in Southampton . So I said , there were other families as I knew , who had far more cause to blush for their sons , and to be thankful if they could think they were earning an honest living far away from home . To which he made answer , like the impudent chap he is , that he were in a confidential situation , and if I knew of any young man who had been so unfortunate as to lead vicious courses , and wanted to turn steady , he ’d have no objection to lend him his patronage . He , indeed ! Why , he ’d corrupt a saint . I ’ve not felt so bad myself for years as when I were standing talking to him the other day . I could have cried to think I could n’t spite him better , for he kept smiling in my face , as if he took all my compliments for earnest ; and I could n’t see that he minded what I said in the least , while I was mad with all his speeches . ”
128906	128920	129093	129093	Dixon	186	“ But you did not tell him anything about us — about Frederick ? ”
128921	128925	128927	128927	Dixon	186	“ Not I , ”
128929	129083	128927	128927	Dixon	186	“ He had never the grace to ask where I was staying ; and I should n’t have told him if he had asked . Nor did I ask him what his precious situation was . He was waiting for a bus , and just then it drove up , and he hailed it . But , to plague me to the last , he turned back before he got in , and said , ‘ If you can help me to trap Lieutenant Hale , Miss Dixon , we ’ll go partners in the reward . I know you ’d like to be my partner , now would n’t you ? Do n’t be shy , but say yes . ’ And he jumped on the bus , and I saw his ugly face leering at me with a wicked smile to think how he ’d had the last word of plaguing . ”
129096	129102	129104	129104	she	123	“ Have you told Frederick ? ”
129106	129109	129111	129111	Dixon	186	“ No , ”
129113	129195	129111	129111	Dixon	186	“ I were uneasy in my mind at knowing that bad Leonards was in town ; but there was so much else to think about that I did not dwell on it all . But when I saw master sitting so stiff , and with his eyes so glazed and sad , I thought it might rouse him to have to think of Master Frederick in hiding , he would have to go , poor fellow , before Mr. Bell came . ”
129196	129226	129285	129285	Frederick	159	“ Oh , I ’m not afraid of Mr. Bell ; but I am afraid of this Leonards . I must tell Frederick . What did Leonards look like ? ”
129227	129280	129111	129111	Dixon	186	“ A bad - looking fellow , I can assure you , miss . Whiskers such as I should be ashamed to wear — they are so red . And for all he said he ’d got a confidential situation , he was dressed in fustian just like a working - man . ”
129432	129440	129442	129442	he	159	“ How wan you look , Margaret ! ”
129448	129477	129442	129442	he	159	“ You have been thinking of everybody , and no one has thought of you . Lie on this sofa — there is nothing for you to do . ”
129478	129484	129486	129486	Margaret	123	“ That is the worst , ”
129557	129601	129546	129546	Frederick	159	“ I should just like to have it out with that young fellow . A worse sailor was never on board ship — nor a much worse man either . I declare , Margaret — you know the circumstances of the whole affair ? ”
129602	129609	129725	129726	Mr. Hale	134	“ Yes , mamma told me . ”
129610	129711	129743	129743	He	134	“ Well , when all the sailors who were good for anything were indignant with our captain , this fellow to curry favour — pah ! And to think of his being here ! Oh , if he ’d a notion I was within twenty miles of him , he ’d ferret me out to pay all old grudges . I ’d rather anybody had the hundred pounds they think I am worth than that rascal . What a pity poor old Dixon could not be persuaded to give me up , and make a provision for her old age ! ”
129712	129724	129725	129726	Mr. Hale	134	“ Oh , Frederick , hush ! Do n’t talk so . ”
129753	129787	129743	129743	He	134	“ My boy , you must go . It is very bad — but I see you must . You have done all you could — you have been a comfort to her . ”
129788	129797	129799	129799	Margaret	123	“ Oh , papa , must he go ? ”
129809	129883	129799	129799	Margaret	123	“ I declare , I ’ve a good mind to face it out , and stand my trial . If I could only pick up my evidence ! I can not endure the thought of being in the power of such a blackguard as Leonards . I could almost have enjoyed — in other circumstances — this stolen visit : it has had all the charm which the Frenchwoman attributed to forbidden pleasures . ”
129884	129894	129896	129896	Margaret	123	“ One of the earliest things I can remember , ”
129898	129966	129896	129896	Margaret	123	“ was your being in some great disgrace , Fred , for stealing apples . We had plenty of our own — trees loaded with them ; but some one had told you that stolen fruit tasted sweetest , which you took _ au pied de la lettre _ , and off you went a - robbing . You have not changed your feelings much since then . ”
129967	129974	129976	129977	Mr. Hale	134	“ Yes — you must go , ”
130078	130210	130072	130072	Frederick	159	“ Do you know , Margaret , I was very nearly giving both Dixon and myself a good fright this afternoon . I was in my bedroom ; I had heard a ring at the front door , but I thought the ringer must have done his business and gone away long ago ; so I was on the point of making my appearance in the passage , when , as I opened my room door , I saw Dixon coming downstairs ; and she frowned and kicked me into hiding again . I kept the door open , and heard a message given to some man that was in my father ’s study , and that then went away . What could it have been ? Some of the shopmen ? ”
130211	130215	130217	130217	Margaret	123	“ Very likely , ”
130220	130236	130217	130217	Margaret	123	“ There was a little quiet man who came up for orders about two o’clock . ”
130237	130261	130072	130072	Frederick	159	“ But this was not a little man — a great powerful fellow ; and it was past four when he was here . ”
130262	130268	130270	130271	Mr. Hale	134	“ It was Mr. Thornton , ”
130284	130288	130290	130290	Margaret	123	“ Mr. Thornton ! ”
130296	130301	130290	130290	Margaret	123	“ I thought — — ”
130302	130313	130315	130315	Frederick	159	“ Well , little one , what did you think ? ”
130325	130330	130332	130332	she	123	“ Oh , only , ”
130341	130363	130332	130332	she	123	“ I fancied you meant some one of a different class , not a gentleman ; somebody come on an errand . ”
130364	130373	130375	130375	Frederick	159	“ He looked like someone of that kind , ”
130379	130394	130375	130375	Frederick	159	“ I took him for a shopman , and he turns out a manufacturer . ”
130478	130537	130473	130474	Mr. Hale	134	“ He came to offer any assistance in his power , I believe . But I could not see him . I told Dixon to ask him if he would like to see you — I think I asked her to find you , and you would go to him . I do n’t know what I said . ”
130538	130551	130553	130553	Frederick	159	“ He has been a very agreeable acquaintance , has he not ? ”
130569	130575	130577	130577	Margaret	123	“ A very kind friend , ”
130598	130650	130595	130595	he	159	“ Margaret , it is painful to think I can never thank those who have shown you kindness . Your acquaintances and mine must be separate . Unless , indeed , I run the chances of a court - martial , or unless you and my father would come to Spain . ”
130670	130693	130695	130695	he	159	“ You do n’t know how I wish you would . I have a good position — the chance of a better , ”
130702	130814	130695	130695	he	159	“ That Dolores Barbour that I was telling you of , Margaret — I only wish you knew her ; I am sure you would like — no , love is the right word , like is so poor — you would love her , father , if you knew her . She is not eighteen ; but if she is in the same mind another year , she is to be my wife . Mr. Barbour wo n’t let us call it an engagement . But if you would come you would find friends everywhere , besides Dolores . Think of it , father . Margaret be on my side . ”
130815	130824	130826	130827	Mr. Hale	134	“ No — no more removals for me , ”
130829	130859	130826	130827	Mr. Hale	134	“ One has cost me my wife . No more removals in this life . She will be here ; and here will I stay out my appointed time . ”
130860	130865	130867	130867	Margaret	123	“ Oh , Frederick , ”
130869	130908	130867	130867	Margaret	123	“ tell us more about her . I never thought of this ; but I am so glad . You will have some one to love and care for you out there . Tell us all about it . ”
130909	130945	130946	130946	Margaret	123	“ In the first place , she is a Roman Catholic . That ’s the only objection I anticipated . But my father ’s change of opinion — nay , Margaret , do n’t sigh . ”
131107	131177	131097	131097	she	123	“ But for her sake , Fred , you surely will try and clear yourself of the exaggerated charges brought against you , even if the charge of mutiny itself be true . If there were to be a court - martial , and you could find your witnesses , you might , at any rate , show your disobedience to authority was because that authority was unworthily exercised . ”
131191	131315	131181	131181	himself	134	“ In the first place , Margaret , who is to hunt up my witnesses ? All of them are sailors , drafted off to other ships , except those whose evidence would go for very little , as they took part or sympathised in the affair . In the next place allow me to tell you , you do n’t know what a court - martial is , and consider it as an assembly where justice is administered , instead of what it really is — a court where authority weighs nine - tenths in the balance , and evidence forms only the other tenth . In such cases , evidence itself can hardly escape being influenced by the prestige of authority . ”
131316	131520	131097	131097	she	123	“ But is it not worth trying , to see how much evidence might be discovered and arrayed on your behalf ? At present , all those who knew you formerly , believe you guilty without any shadow of excuse . You have never tried to justify yourself , and we have never known where to seek for proofs of your justification . Now , for Miss Barbour ’s sake , make your conduct as clear as you can in the eye of the world . She may not care for it ; she has , I am sure , that trust in you that we all have ; but you ought not to let her ally herself to one under such a serious charge , without showing the world exactly how it is you stand . You disobeyed authority — that was bad ; but to have stood by , without word or act , while the authority was brutally used , would have been infinitely worse . People know what you did ; but not the motives that elevate it out of a crime into an heroic protection of the weak . For Dolores ’ sake , they ought to know . ”
131521	131622	131918	131918	Margaret	123	“ But how must I make them know ? I am not sufficiently sure of the purity and justice of those who would be my judges , to give myself up to a court - martial , even if I could bring a whole array of truth - speaking witnesses . I ca n’t send a bell - man about , to cry aloud and proclaim in the streets what you are pleased to call my heroism . No one would read a pamphlet of self - justification so long after the deed , even if I put one out . ”
131623	131636	131638	131638	Margaret	123	“ Will you consult a lawyer as to your chances of exculpation ? ”
131648	131715	131638	131638	Margaret	123	“ I must first catch my lawyer , and have a look at him , and see how I like him , before I make him into my confidant . Many a briefless barrister might twist his conscience into thinking , that he could earn a hundred pounds very easily by doing a good action — in giving me , a criminal , up to justice . ”
131716	131770	131918	131918	Margaret	123	“ Nonsense , Frederick!—because I know a lawyer on whose honour I can rely ; of whose cleverness in his profession people speak very highly ; and who would , I think , take a good deal of trouble for any of — Aunt Shaw ’s relations . Mr. Henry Lennox , papa . ”
131771	131780	131782	131783	Mr. Hale	134	“ I think it is a good idea , ”
131785	131807	131782	131783	Mr. Hale	134	“ But do n’t propose anything which will detain Frederick in England . Do n’t , for your mother ’s sake . ”
131808	131820	131822	131822	Margaret	123	“ You could go to London by a night - train , ”
131830	131844	131846	131846	she	123	“ He must go to - morrow , I ’m afraid , papa , ”
131850	131866	131846	131846	she	123	“ we fixed that , because of Mr. Bell , and Dixon ’s disagreeable acquaintance . ”
131867	131877	131879	131879	Frederick	159	“ Yes ; I must go to - morrow , ”
131887	131911	131883	131884	Mr. Hale	134	“ I ca n’t bear to part with you , and yet I am miserable with anxiety as long as you stop here . ”
131912	131916	131918	131918	Margaret	123	“ Well then , ”
131920	131966	131918	131918	Margaret	123	“ listen to my plan . He gets to London on Friday morning . I will — you might — no ! it would be better to give him a note to Mr. Lennox . You will find him at his chambers in the Temple . ”
131967	132069	131846	131846	she	123	“ I will write down a list of all the names I can remember on board the Orion . I could leave it with him to ferret them out . He is Edith ’s husband ’s brother , is n’t he ? I remember your naming him in your letters . I have money in Barbour ’s hands . I can pay a pretty long bill , if there ’s any chance of success . Money , dear father , that I had meant for a different purpose ; so I shall only consider it as borrowed from you and Margaret . ”
132070	132076	132078	132078	Margaret	123	“ Do n’t do that , ”
132080	132114	132078	132078	Margaret	123	“ You wo n’t risk it if you do . And it will be as risk ; only it is worth trying . You can sail from London as well as from Liverpool ? ”
132115	132181	132078	132078	Margaret	123	“ To be sure , little goose . Wherever I feel water heaving under a plank , there I feel at home . I ’ll pick up some craft or other to take me off , never fear . I wo n’t stay twenty - four hours in London , away from you on the one hand , and from somebody else on the other . ”
132317	132330	132332	132332	he	159	“ Now you would like to see that , would n’t you ? ”
132334	132370	132332	132332	he	159	“ No ! you must wait till you see her herself . She is too perfect to be known by fragments . No mean brick shall be a specimen of the building of my palace . ”
132376	132393	132394	132394	WERNER	351	“ What ! remain to be Denounced — dragged , it may be , in chains . ”
132656	132694	132653	132653	he	134	“ You will go with Frederick to the station , Margaret ? I shall want to know he is safely off . You will bring me word that he is clear of Milton , at any rate ? ”
132695	132698	132700	132700	Margaret	123	“ Certainly , ”
132702	132719	132653	132653	he	134	“ I shall like it , if you wo n’t be lonely without me , papa . ”
132720	132796	132653	132653	he	134	“ No , no ! I should always be fancying some one had known him , and that he had been stopped , unless you could tell me you had seen him off . And go to the Outwood station . It is quite as near , and not so many people about . Take a cab there . There is less risk of his being seen . What time is your train , Fred ? ”
132797	132815	132653	132653	he	134	“ Ten minutes past six ; very nearly dark . So what will you do , Margaret ? ”
132816	132859	132653	132653	he	134	“ Oh , I can manage . I am getting very brave and very hard . It is a well - lighted road all the way home , if it should be dark . But I was out last week much later . ”

133060	133167	133053	133053	He	159	“ Margaret ! I am going to consult Mr. Lennox as to the chance of exculpating myself so that I may return to England whenever I choose , more for your sake than for the sake of anyone else . I ca n’t bear to think of your lonely position if any thing should happen to my father . He looks sadly changed — terribly shaken . I wish you could get him to think of the Cadiz plan , for many reasons . What could you do if he were taken away ? You have no friend near . We are curiously bare of relations . ”
133220	133273	133274	133274	She	123	“ There have been such strange unexpected changes in my life during these last two years , that I feel more than ever that it is not worth while to calculate too closely what I should do if any future event took place . I try to think only upon the present . ”
133339	133373	133335	133335	She	123	“ We shall write often to one another , and I will promise — for I see it will set your mind at ease — to tell you every worry I have . Papa is”—she
133430	133435	133437	133437	Frederick	159	“ Who is that ? ”
133461	133473	133447	133447	Margaret	123	“ Mr. Thornton ; you saw him before , you know . ”
133474	133493	133458	133458	she	123	“ Only his back . He is an unprepossessing - looking fellow . What a scowl he has ! ”
133494	133502	133504	133504	Margaret	123	“ Something has happened to vex him , ”
133507	133523	133504	133504	Margaret	123	“ You would not have thought him unprepossessing if you had seen him with mamma . ”
133524	133559	133458	133458	she	123	“ I fancy it must be time to go and take my ticket . If I had known how dark it would be , we would n’t have sent back the cab , Margaret . ”
133560	133646	133647	133647	They	3443	“ Oh , do n’t fidget about that . I can take a cab here , if I like ; or go back by the rail - road , when I should have shops and people and lamps all the way from the Milton station - house . Do n’t think of me ; take care of yourself . I am sick with the thought that Leonards may be in the same train with you . Look well into the carriage before you get in . ”
133737	133753	133755	133755	she	123	“ Have you got your bag ? Let us walk about here on the platform , ”
133953	133960	133962	133962	he	1589	“ By your leave , miss ! ”
133978	133987	133962	133962	he	1589	“ Your name is Hale , I believe ? ”
134054	134059	134061	134061	Margaret	123	“ Run , run ! ”
134063	134086	134061	134061	Margaret	123	“ The train is here . It was Leonards , was it ? oh , run ! I will carry your bag . ”
134124	134131	134118	134118	he	1589	“ God bless you , Margaret ! ”

He came in not five minutes ago , with some long story or other about a fall he ’d had , swearing awfully : and wanted to borrow some money from me to go to London by the next up - train . He made all sorts of tipsy promises , but I ’d something else to do than listen to him ; I told him to go about his business ; and he went off at the front door . ”
134578	134591	134593	134595	the first speaker	3476	“ He ’s at the nearest vaults , I ’ll be bound , ”

135022	135025	135020	135020	Margaret	123	“ Yes , ”
135030	135035	135020	135020	Margaret	123	“ I suppose so . ”
135036	135055	135027	135028	her father	444	“ If he can come , he will be here to - morrow evening , I should think . ”
135056	135088	135020	135020	Margaret	123	“ If he can not come , I shall ask Mr. Thornton to go with me to the funeral . I can not go alone . I should break down utterly . ”
135089	135104	135106	135106	Margaret	123	“ Do n’t ask Mr. Thornton , papa . Let me go with you , ”
135110	135122	135106	135106	Margaret	123	“ You ! My dear , women do not generally go . ”
135123	135234	135020	135020	Margaret	123	“ No ; because they ca n’t control themselves . Women of our class do n’t go , because they have no power over their emotions , and yet are ashamed of showing them . Poor women go , and do n’t care if they are seen overwhelmed with grief . But I promise you , papa , that if you will let me go , I will be no trouble . Do n’t have a stranger , and leave me out . Dear papa ! if Mr. Bell can not come , I shall go . I wo n’t urge my wish against your will , if he does . ”
135432	135443	135445	135445	she	123	“ Oh , do n’t let us have these forms , ”
135447	135486	135445	135445	she	123	“ Let us go alone — you and me , papa . They do n’t care for us , or else he would have offered to go himself , and not have proposed this sending an empty carriage . ”
135487	135501	135503	135504	Mr. Hale	134	“ I thought you were so extremely averse to his going , Margaret , ”
135509	135554	135555	135555	She	3502	“ And so I am . I do n’t want him to come at all ; and I should especially dislike the idea of our asking him . But this seems such a mockery of mourning that I did not expect it from him . ”
136120	136198	136113	136113	he	444	“ Pray for me , Margaret . I have no strength left in me . I can not pray . I give her up because I must . I try to bear it : indeed I do . I know it is God ’s will . But I can not see why she died . Pray for me , Margaret , that I may have faith to pray . It is a great strait , my child . ”
136530	136561	136498	136498	He	179	“ I beg your pardon,—but , can you tell me how Mr. Hale is ? And Miss Hale , too ? I should like to know how they both are . ”
136562	136591	136498	136498	He	179	“ Of course , sir . They are much as is to be expected . Master is terribly broke down . Miss Hale bears up better than likely . ”
136717	136721	136728	136728	He	179	“ Miserably disturbed ! ”

137000	137007	137009	137009	he	179	“ I suppose I may call , ”
137012	137032	137033	137033	He	179	“ On Mr. Hale , I mean . He will perhaps admit me after to - morrow or so . ”
137132	137165	137111	137111	He	179	“ I dare say , sir , master will see you . He was very sorry to have to deny you the other day ; but circumstances was not agreeable just then . ”

137810	137817	137819	137819	Margaret	123	“ What is it , Dixon ? ”
137832	137839	137841	137841	Dixon	186	“ Come this way , miss , ”
137875	137882	137884	137884	Dixon	186	“ It ’s nothing , miss , ”
137890	137917	137884	137884	Dixon	186	“ Only a police - inspector . He wants to see you , miss . But I dare say , it ’s about nothing at all . ”
137918	137923	137925	137925	Margaret	123	“ Did he name — ”
137930	138000	137925	137925	Margaret	123	“ No , miss ; he named nothing . He only asked if you lived here , and if he could speak to you . Martha went to the door , and let him in ; she has shown him into master ’s study . I went to him myself , to try if that would do ; but no — it ’s you , miss , he wants . ”
138025	138041	138019	138019	she	123	“ Take care papa does not come down . Mr. Thornton is with him now . ”
138109	138206	138106	138106	she	123	“ I beg your pardon , ma’am , but my duty obliges me to ask you a few plain questions . A man has died at the Infirmary , in consequence of a fall , received at Outwood station , between the hours of five and six on Thursday evening , the twenty - sixth instant . At the time , this fall did not seem of much consequence ; but it was rendered fatal , the doctors say , by the presence of some internal complaint , and the man ’s own habit of drinking . ”
138315	138320	138302	138302	she	123	tale—“Well — go on ! ”
138321	138432	138302	138302	she	123	“ It is supposed that an inquest will have to be held ; there is some slight evidence to prove that the blow , or push , or scuffle that caused the fall , was provoked by this poor fellow ’s half - tipsy impertinence to a young lady , walking with the man who pushed the deceased over the edge of the platform . This much was observed by some one on the platform , who , however , thought no more about the matter , as the blow seemed of slight consequence . There is also some reason to identify the lady with yourself ; in which case — ”
138433	138439	138441	138441	Margaret	123	“ I was not there , ”
138903	138906	138910	138910	he	345	“ Cornish trick ”
138977	139013	138964	138964	She	123	“ Then , madam , I have your denial that you were the lady accompanying the gentleman who struck the blow , or gave the push , which caused the death of this poor man ? ”
139025	139036	139037	139042	A deep observer of human countenances	3604	“ Oh God ! that I knew Frederick were safe ! ”
139122	139128	139130	139130	she	123	“ I was not there , ”
139229	139272	139213	139213	she	123	“ I hope you will not think me impertinent when I say , that I may have to call on you again . I may have to summon you to appear on the inquest , and prove an alibi , if my witnesses ”
139283	139295	139296	139296	He	3560	“ persist in deposing to your presence at the unfortunate event . ”
139362	139401	139358	139358	He	3560	“ It is very unlikely , ma’am , that I shall have to do anything of the kind . I hope you will excuse me for doing what is only my duty , although it may appear impertinent . ”

140498	140507	140494	140494	she	123	“ a dog , and done this thing . ”
140700	140716	140693	140694	Mr. Thornton	179	“ My name is Watson — George Watson , sir , that you got — — ”
140717	140732	140651	140654	the police - inspector	3631	“ Ah , yes ! Why you are getting on famously , I hear . ”
140733	140791	140693	140694	Mr. Thornton	179	“ Yes , sir . I ought to thank you , sir . But it is on a little matter of business I made so bold as to speak to you now . I believe you were the magistrate who attended to take down the deposition of a poor man who died in the Infirmary last night . ”
140792	140795	140797	140798	Mr. Thornton	179	“ Yes , ”
140800	140875	140797	140798	Mr. Thornton	179	“ I went and heard some kind of a rambling statement , which the clerk said was of no great use . I ’m afraid he was but a drunken fellow , though there is no doubt he came to his death by violence at last . One of my mother ’s servants was engaged to him , I believe , and she is in great distress to - day . What about him ? ”
140876	140910	140651	140654	the police - inspector	3631	“ Why , sir , his death is oddly mixed up with somebody in the house I saw you coming out of just now ; it was a Mr. Hales ’s I believe . ”
140911	140914	140916	140917	Mr. Thornton	179	“ Yes ! ”
140933	140938	140916	140917	Mr. Thornton	179	“ What about it ? ”
140939	141005	140651	140654	the police - inspector	3631	“ Why , sir , it seems to me that I have got a pretty distinct chain of evidence , inculpating a gentleman who was walking with Miss Hale that night at the Outwood station , as the man who struck or pushed Leonards off the platform and so caused his death . But the young lady denies that she was there at the time . ”
141006	141014	141016	141017	Mr. Thornton	179	“ Miss Hale denies she was there ! ”
141023	141035	141016	141017	Mr. Thornton	179	“ Tell me , what evening was it ? What time ? ”
141036	141052	141053	141053	They	3635	“ About six o’clock , on the evening of Thursday , the twenty - sixth . ”
141077	141248	141069	141070	The inspector	3560	“ You see , sir , there is like to be a coroner ’s inquest ; and I ’ve got a young man who is pretty positive,—at least he was at first;—since he has heard of the young lady ’s denial , he says he should not like to swear ; but still he ’s pretty positive that he saw Miss Hale at the station , walking about with a gentleman , not five minutes before the time , when one of the porters saw a scuffle , which he set down to some of Leonards ’ impudence — but which led to the fall which caused his death . And seeing you come out of the very house , sir , I thought I might make bold to ask if — you see , it ’s always awkward having to do with cases of disputed identity , and one does n’t like to doubt the word of a respectable young woman unless one has strong proof to the contrary . ”
141249	141261	141263	141264	Mr. Thornton	179	“ And she denied having been at the station that evening ! ”
141273	141351	141263	141264	Mr. Thornton	179	“ Yes , sir , twice over , as distinct as could be . I told her I should call again , but seeing you just as I was on my way back from questioning the young man who said it was her , I thought I would ask your advice , both as the magistrate who saw Leonards on his death - bed , and as the gentleman who got me my berth in the force . ”
141352	141358	141360	141361	Mr. Thornton	179	“ You were quite right , ”
141363	141376	141360	141361	Mr. Thornton	179	“ Do n’t take any steps till you have seen me again . ”
141377	141392	141263	141264	Mr. Thornton	179	“ The young lady will expect me to call , from what I said . ”
141393	141415	141360	141361	Mr. Thornton	179	“ I only want to delay you an hour . It ’s now three . Come to my warehouse at four . ”
141416	141422	141263	141264	Mr. Thornton	179	“ Very well , sir ! ”
142048	142107	142037	142037	he	179	“ I appointed Watson — he who was a packer in the warehouse , and who went into the police — to call on me at four o’clock . I have just met a gentleman from Liverpool who wishes to see me before he leaves town . Take care to give this note to Watson when he calls . ”
142114	142148	142037	142037	he	179	“ There will be no inquest . Medical evidence not sufficient to justify it . Take no further steps . I have not seen the coroner ; but I will take the responsibility . ”
142149	142152	142154	142154	Watson	353	“ Well , ”
142156	142303	142154	142154	Watson	353	“ it relieves me from an awkward job . None of my witnesses seemed certain of anything except the young woman . She was clear and distinct enough ; the porter at the railroad had seen a scuffle ! or when he found it was likely to bring him in as a witness , then it might not have been a scuffle , only a little larking , and Leonards might have jumped off the platform himself;—he would not stick firm to anything . And Jennings , the grocer ’s shopman,—well , he was not quite so bad , but I doubt if I could have got him up to an oath after he heard that Miss Hale flatly denied it . It would have been a troublesome job and no satisfaction . And now I must go and tell them they wo n’t be wanted . ”
142536	142556	142521	142521	She	123	“ You will go to bed soon , papa , wo n’t you ? Do n’t sit up alone ! ”
142635	142662	142630	142630	She	123	“ Do n’t come ; I will open the door . I know it is him — I can — I must manage it all myself . ”
142663	142670	142672	142672	Dixon	186	“ As you please , miss ! ”
142685	142701	142682	142682	she	123	“ But you ’re not fit for it . You are more dead than alive . ”
142702	142706	142708	142708	Margaret	123	“ Am I ? ”
142771	142776	142778	142778	she	123	“ You are late ! ”
142780	142783	142778	142778	she	123	“ Well ? ”
142792	142843	142784	142784	She	123	“ I am sorry to have given any unnecessary trouble , ma’am ; for , after all , they ’ve given up all thoughts of holding an inquest . I have had other work to do and other people to see , or I should have been here before now . ”
142844	142850	142852	142852	Margaret	123	“ Then it is ended , ”
142854	142863	142852	142852	Margaret	123	“ There is to be no further enquiry . ”
142864	142877	142879	142880	the Inspector	3560	“ I believe I ’ve got Mr. Thornton ’s note about me , ”
142889	142894	142896	142896	Margaret	123	“ Mr. Thornton ’s ! ”
142898	142912	142896	142896	Margaret	123	“ Yes ! he ’s a magistrate — ah ! here it is . ”
142958	143016	142939	142939	she	123	“ I ’m sure , ma’am , it ’s a great weight off my mind ; for the evidence was so uncertain , you see , that the man had received any blow at all , and if any question of identity came in , it so complicated the case , as I told Mr. Thornton — — ”
143017	143021	143023	143023	Margaret	123	“ Mr. Thornton ! ”
143026	143074	143023	143023	Margaret	123	“ I met him this morning , just as he was coming out of this house , and , as he ’s an old friend of mine , besides being the magistrate who saw Leonards last night , I made bold to tell him of my difficulty . ”
143119	143146	143147	143147	she	123	“ Thank you for calling . It is very late . I dare say it is past ten o’clock . Oh ! here is the note ! ”
143173	143200	143170	143170	she	123	“ I think it is a cramped , dazzling sort of writing . I could not read it ; will you just read it to me ? ”
143208	143222	143201	143201	He	1353	“ Thank you . You told Mr. Thornton that I was not there ? ”
143223	143293	143299	143299	She	123	“ Oh , of course , ma’am . I ’m sorry now that I acted upon information , which seems to have been so erroneous . At first the young man was so positive ; and now he says that he doubted all along , and hopes that his mistake wo n’t have occasioned you such annoyance as to lose their shop your custom . Good night , ma’am . ”
143294	143298	143299	143299	She	123	“ Good night . ”
143321	143327	143329	143329	she	123	“ It is all right ! ”
143697	143704	143705	143705	she	123	“ Oh , Frederick ! Frederick ! ”
143708	143717	143705	143705	she	123	“ what have I not sacrificed for you ! ”
144204	144221	144197	144197	she	123	“ Here ’s something to do you good , miss . A letter from Master Frederick . ”
144222	144233	144234	144234	She	123	“ Thank you , Dixon . How late it is ! ”
144260	144290	144241	144241	Dixon	186	“ You want your breakfast , I ’m sure . I will bring it you in a minute . Master has got the tray all ready , I know . ”
144495	144500	144502	144502	Frederick	159	“ It struck me , ”
144504	144691	144502	144502	Frederick	159	“ that your introduction , little sister of mine , went a long way . Is it so ? He made so many inquiries , I can assure you . He seemed a sharp , intelligent fellow , and in good practice too , to judge from the signs of business and the number of clerks about him . But these may be only lawyer ’s dodges . I have just caught a packet on the point of sailing — I am off in five minutes . I may have to come back to England again on this business , so keep my visit secret . I shall send my father some rare old sherry , such as you can not buy in England ( such stuff as I ’ve got in the bottle before me ) ! He needs something of the kind — my dear love to him — God bless him . I ’m sure — here ’s my cab . P.S.—What an escape that was ! Take care you do n’t breathe of my having been — not even to the Shaws . ”
144701	144705	144502	144502	Frederick	159	“ Too late . ”
144792	144802	144788	144788	her	123	“ Fais ce que dois , advienne que pourra ? ”
145160	145182	145183	145183	He	134	“ You are sadly overdone , Margaret . It is no wonder . But you must let me nurse you now . ”
145213	145218	145220	145220	he	134	“ Poor child!—poor child ! ”
145592	145613	145615	145615	Margaret	123	“ It seems strange to think , that what gives us most hope for the future should be called Dolores , ”
145643	145680	145636	145636	they	3714	“ Her mother was a Spaniard , I believe : that accounts for her religion . Her father was a stiff Presbyterian when I knew him . But it is a very soft and pretty name . ”
145681	145718	145719	145719	He	3715	“ How young she is!—younger by fourteen months than I am . Just the age that Edith was when she was engaged to Captain Lennox . Papa , we will go and see them in Spain . ”
145728	145803	145725	145725	he	3715	“ If you wish it Margaret . Only let us come back here . It would seem unfair — unkind to your mother , who always , I ’m afraid , disliked Milton so much , if we left it now she is lying here , and can not go with us . No , dear ; you shall go and see them , and bring me back a report of my Spanish daughter . ”
145804	145828	145636	145636	they	3714	“ No , papa , I wo n’t go without you . Who is to take care of you when I am gone ? ”
145829	145893	145903	145903	she	123	“ I should like to know which of us is taking care of the other . But if you went , I should persuade Mr. Thornton to let me give him double lessons . We would work up the classics famously . That would be a perpetual interest . You might go on , and see Edith at Corfu , if you liked . ”
145908	145975	145903	145903	she	123	“ Thank you , papa . But I do n’t want to go . We will hope that Mr. Lennox will manage so well , that Frederick may bring Dolores to see us when they are married . And as for Edith , the regiment wo n’t remain much longer in Corfu . Perhaps we shall see both of them here before another year is out . ”
146008	146051	146005	146005	Margaret	123	“ Papa — did you see Nicholas Higgins at the funeral ? He was there , and Mary too . Poor fellow ! it was his way of showing sympathy . He has a good warm heart under his bluff abrupt ways . ”
146052	146059	146061	146062	Mr. Hale	134	“ I am sure of it , ”
146064	146107	146061	146062	Mr. Hale	134	“ I saw it all along , even while you tried to persuade me that he was all sorts of bad things . We will go and see them to - morrow , if you are strong enough to walk so far . ”
146108	146156	146005	146005	Margaret	123	“ Oh yes . I want to see them . We did not pay Mary — or rather she refused to take it , Dixon says . We will go so as to catch him just after his dinner , and before he goes to his work . ”
146163	146202	146159	146160	Mr. Hale	134	“ I half expected Mr. Thornton would have called . He spoke of a book yesterday which he had , and which I wanted to see . He said he would try and bring it to - day . ”
146528	146545	146595	146595	her	123	“ with Mr. Thornton ’s kind regards , and wishes to know how Mr. Hale is . ”
146546	146561	146595	146595	her	123	“ Say that I am much better , Dixon , but that Miss Hale — ”
146562	146567	146569	146569	Margaret	123	“ No , papa , ”
146571	146582	146569	146569	Margaret	123	eagerly—“don’t say anything about me . He does not ask . ”
146583	146593	146595	146596	her father	444	“ My dear child , how you are shivering ! ”
146603	146617	146595	146596	her father	444	“ You must go to bed directly . You have turned quite pale ! ”
146737	146758	146759	146759	SHELLEY	357	“ The steps of the bearers , heavy and slow , The sobs of the mourners , deep and low . ”
146894	146908	146910	146910	he	202	“ Sit ye down , sit ye down . Fire ’s welly out , ”
146968	146987	146989	146989	Margaret	123	“ We thought we should have a good chance of finding you , just after dinner - time , ”
146991	147004	147006	147007	Mr. Hale	134	“ We have had our sorrows too , since we saw you , ”
147009	147042	147006	147007	Mr. Hale	134	“ Ay , ay . Sorrows is more plentiful than dinners just now ; I reckon , my dinner hour stretches all o’er the day ; yo’re pretty sure of finding me . ”
147043	147050	147052	147052	Margaret	123	“ Are you out of work ? ”
147054	147057	147058	147058	he	202	“ Ay , ”
147080	147134	147070	147070	he	202	“ I ’m not wanting brass . Dunno yo ’ think it . Bess , poor lass , had a little stock under her pillow , ready to slip into my hand , last moment , and Mary is fustian - cutting . But I ’m out of work a ’ the same . ”
147135	147142	147144	147145	Mr. Hale	134	“ We owe Mary some money , ”
147160	147194	147148	147148	Margaret	123	“ If hoo takes it , I ’ll turn her out o ’ doors . I ’ll bide inside these four walls , and she ’ll bide out . That ’s a ’ . ”
147195	147207	147209	147210	Mr. Hale	134	“ But we owe her many thanks for her kind service , ”
147213	147263	147209	147210	Mr. Hale	134	“ I ne’er thanken your daughter theer for her deeds o ’ love to my poor wench . I ne’er could find th ’ words . I’se have to begin to try now , if yo ’ start making an ado about what little Mary could sarve yo ’ . ”
147264	147277	147279	147279	Margaret	123	“ Is it because of the strike you ’re out of work ? ”
147282	147326	147279	147279	Margaret	123	“ Strike ’s ended . It ’s o’er for this time . I ’m out o ’ work because I ne’er asked for it . And I ne’er asked for it , because good words is scarce , and bad words is plentiful . ”
147359	147366	147346	147346	Margaret	123	“ And good words are — ? ”
147367	147408	147209	147210	Mr. Hale	134	“ Asking for work . I reckon them ’s almost the best words that men can say . ‘ Gi ’ me work ’ means ‘ and I ’ll do it like a man . ’ Them ’s good words . ”
147409	147423	147209	147210	Mr. Hale	134	“ And bad words are refusing you work when you ask for it . ”
147424	147571	147346	147346	Margaret	123	“ Ay . Bad words is saying ‘ Aha , my fine chap ! Yo’ve been true to yo’r order , and I ’ll be true to mine . Yo ’ did the best yo ’ could for them as wanted help ; that ’s yo’re way of being true to yo’re kind : and I ’ll be true to mine . Yo’ve been a poor fool , as knowed no better nor be a true faithful fool . So go and be d — d to yo ’ . There ’s no work for yo ’ here . ’ Them ’s bad words . I ’m not a fool ; and if I was , folk ought to ha ’ taught me how to be wise after their fashion . I could m’appen ha ’ learnt , if any one had tried to teach me . ”
147572	147580	147582	147583	Mr. Hale	134	“ Would it not be worth while , ”
147585	147613	147614	147614	He	134	“ to ask your old master if he would take you back again ? It might be a poor chance , but it would be a chance . ”
147636	147658	147614	147614	He	134	“ Measter ! if it ’s no offence , I ’ll ask yo ’ a question or two in my turn . ”
147659	147665	147667	147668	Mr. Hale	134	“ You ’re quite welcome , ”
147670	147698	147667	147668	Mr. Hale	134	“ I reckon yo’n some way of earning your bread . Folk seldom lives i ’ Milton just for pleasure , if they can live anywhere else . ”
147699	147725	147614	147614	He	134	“ You are quite right . I have some independent property , but my intention in settling in Milton was to become a private tutor . ”
147726	147746	147614	147614	He	134	“ To teach folk . Well ! I reckon they pay yo ’ for teaching them , dunnot they ? ”
147747	147750	147752	147753	Mr. Hale	134	“ Yes , ”
147757	147766	147752	147753	Mr. Hale	134	“ I teach in order to get paid . ”
147767	147808	147614	147614	He	134	“ And them that pays yo ’ , dun they tell yo ’ whatten to do , or whatten not to do wi ’ the money they gives you in just payment for your pains — in fair exchange like ? ”
147809	147817	147614	147614	He	134	“ No ; to be sure not ! ”
147818	147923	147752	147753	Mr. Hale	134	“ They dunnot say , ‘ Yo ’ may have a brother , or a friend as dear as a brother , who wants this here brass for a purpose both yo ’ and he think right ; but yo ’ mun promise not give it to him . Yo ’ may see a good use , as yo ’ think , to put yo’r money to ; but we do n’t think it good , and so if yo ’ spend it a - thatens we ’ll just leave off dealing with yo ’ . ’ They dunnot say that , dun they ? ”
147924	147932	147614	147614	He	134	“ No : to be sure not ! ”
147933	147943	147614	147614	He	134	“ Would yo ’ stand it if they did ? ”
147944	147964	147752	147753	Mr. Hale	134	“ It would be some very hard pressure that would make me even think of submitting to such dictation . ”
147965	147981	147983	147984	Nicholas Higgins	202	“ There ’s not the pressure on all the broad earth that would make me , ”
147986	148040	148042	148042	he	202	“ Now yo’ve got it . Yo’ve hit the bull ’s eye . Hampers — that ’s where I worked — makes their men pledge ’ emselves they ’ll not give a penny to help th ’ Union or keep turn - outs fro ’ clemming . They may pledge and make pledge , ”
148046	148194	148042	148042	he	202	“ they nobbut make liars and hypocrites . And that ’s a less sin , to my mind , to make men ’s hearts so hard that they ’ll not do a kindness to them as needs it , or help on the right and just cause , though it goes again the strong hand . But I ’ll ne’er forswear mysel ’ for a ’ the work the king could gi’e me . I ’m a member o ’ the Union ; and I think it ’s the only thing to do the workmen any good . And I ’ve been a turn - out , and known what it was to clem ; so if I get a shilling , sixpence shall go to them if they axe it from me . Consequence is , I dunnot see where I ’m to get a shilling . ”
148195	148212	148214	148214	Margaret	123	“ Is that rule about not contributing to the Union in force at all the mills ? ”
148216	148265	148214	148214	Margaret	123	“ I can not say . It ’s a new regulation at ours ; and I reckon they ’ll find that they can not stick to it . But it ’s in force now . By - and - by they ’ll find out , tyrants makes liars . ”
148340	148378	148319	148319	she	123	“ Do you remember poor Boucher saying that the Union was a tyrant ? I think he said it was the worse tyrant of all . And I remember , at the time I agreed with him . ”
148416	148636	148388	148388	He	202	“ I ’ll not deny but what th ’ Union finds it necessary to force a man into his own good . I ’ll speak truth . A man leads a dree life who ’s not i ’ th ’ Union . But once i ’ th ’ Union , his interests are taken care on better nor he could do it for himsel ’ , or by himsel ’ , for that matter . It ’s the only way working men can get their rights , by all joining together . More the members , more chance for each one separate man having justice done him . Government takes care o ’ fools and madmen ; and if any man is inclined to do himsel ’ or his neighbour a hurt , it puts a bit of a check on him , whether he likes it or no . That ’s all we do i ’ th ’ Union . We ca n’t clap folk into prison ; but we can make a man ’s life so heavy to be borne , that he ’s obliged to come in , and be wise and helpful in spite of himsel ’ . Boucher were a fool all along , and ne’er a worse fool than at th ’ last . ”
148637	148643	148645	148645	Margaret	123	“ He did you harm ? ”
148647	148683	148645	148645	Margaret	123	“ Aye , that did he . We had public opinion on our side , till he and his sort began rioting and breaking laws . It were all o’er wi ’ the strike then . ”
148684	148720	148388	148388	He	202	“ Then would it not have been far better to have left him alone , and not forced him to join the Union ? He did you no good ; and you drove him mad . ”
148721	148724	148737	148737	he	444	“ Margaret , ”
148747	148752	148754	148754	Higgins	202	“ I like her , ”
148758	148954	148754	148754	Higgins	202	“ Hoo speaks plain out what ’s in her mind . Hoo does n’t comprehend th ’ Union for all that . It ’s a great power : it ’s our only power . I ha ’ read a bit o ’ poetry about a plough going o’er a daisy , as made tears come into my eyes , afore I ’d other cause for crying . But the chap ne’er stopped driving the plough , I’se warrant , for all he was pitiful about the daisy . He ’d too much mother - wit for that . Th ’ Union ’s the plough , making ready the land for harvest - time . Such as Boucher—’twould be settin ’ him up too much to liken him to a daisy ; he ’s liker a weed lounging over the ground — mun just made up their mind to be put out o ’ the way . I ’m sore vexed wi ’ him just now . So m’appen , I dunnot speak him fair . I could go o’er him wi ’ a plough mysel ’ , wi ’ a ’ the pleasure in life . ”
148955	148967	148388	148388	He	202	“ Why ? What has he been doing ? Anything fresh ? ”
148968	149259	148754	148754	Higgins	202	“ Ay , to be sure . He ’s ne’er out o ’ mischief , that man . First of a ’ he must go raging like a mad fool , and kick up yon riot . Then he ’d to go into hiding , where he ’d a been yet , if Thornton had followed him out as I ’d hoped he would ha ’ done . But Thornton , having got his own purpose , did n’t care to go on wi ’ the prosecution for the riot . So Boucher slunk back again to his house . He ne’er showed himsel ’ abroad for a day or two . He had that grace . And then , where think ye that he went ? Why , to Hampers ’ . Damn him ! He went wi ’ his mealy - mouthed face , that turns me sick to look at , a - asking for work , though he knowed well enough the new rule , o ’ pledging themselves to give nought to th ’ Unions ; nought to help the starving turn - out ! Why he ’d a clemmed to death , if th ’ Union had na helped him in his pinch . There he went , ossing to promise aught , and pledge himsel ’ to aught — to tell a ’ he know’d on our proceedings , the good - for - nothing Judas ! But I ’ll say this for Hamper , and thank him for it at my dying day , he drove Boucher away , and would na listen to him — ne’er a word — though folk standing by , says the traitor cried like a babby ! ”
149260	149269	149271	149271	Margaret	123	“ Oh ! how shocking ! how pitiful ! ”
149273	149323	149271	149271	Margaret	123	“ Higgins , I do n’t know you to - day . Do n’t you see how you ’ve made Boucher what he is , by driving him into the Union against his will — without his heart going with it . You have made him what he is ! ”
149548	149563	149543	149543	they	3741	“ We found him i ’ th ’ brook in the field beyond there . ”
149564	149577	149609	149609	Higgins	202	“ Th ’ brook!—why there ’s not water enough to drown him ! ”
149578	149608	149609	149609	Higgins	202	“ He was a determined chap . He lay with his face downwards . He was sick enough o ’ living , choose what cause he had for it . ”
149627	149674	149609	149609	Higgins	202	“ It ’s not John Boucher ? He had na spunk enough . Sure ! It ’s not John Boucher ! Why , they are a ’ looking this way ! Listen ! I ’ve a singing in my head , and I can not hear . ”
149891	149924	149873	149875	one of them	3749	“ Higgins , thou knowed him ! Thou mun go tell the wife . Do it gently , man , but do it quick , for we canna leave him here long . ”
149925	149930	149932	149932	Higgins	202	“ I canna go , ”
149934	149944	149932	149932	Higgins	202	“ Dunnot ask me . I canna face her . ”
149945	149951	149953	149954	the man	1353	“ Thou knows her best , ”
149956	149971	149953	149954	the man	1353	“ We’n done a deal in bringing him here — thou take thy share . ”
149972	149978	149980	149980	Higgins	202	“ I canna do it , ”
149982	150003	149980	149980	Higgins	202	“ I ’m welly felled wi ’ seeing him . We was n’t friends ; and now he ’s dead . ”
150004	150060	149953	149954	the man	1353	“ Well , if thou wunnot thou wunnot . Some one mun though . It ’s a dree task ; but it ’s a chance , every minute , as she does n’t hear on it in some rougher way nor a person going to make her let on by degrees , as it were . ”
150061	150068	150070	150070	Margaret	123	“ Papa , do you go , ”
150077	150101	150070	150070	Margaret	123	“ If I could — if I had time to think of what I had better say ; but all at once — — ”
150119	150124	150126	150126	she	123	“ I will go , ”
150128	150164	150126	150126	she	123	“ Bless yo ’ miss , it will be a kind act ; for she ’s been but a sickly sort o ’ body , I hear , and few hereabouts know much on her . ”
150318	150334	150314	150314	She	123	“ How are you , Mrs. Boucher ? But very poorly , I ’m afraid . ”
150335	150344	150346	150346	she	123	“ I ’ve chance o ’ being well , ”
150349	150384	150346	150346	she	123	“ I ’m left alone to manage these childer , and nought for to give ’em for to keep ’em quiet . John should na ha ’ left me , and me so poorly . ”
150385	150395	150314	150314	She	123	“ How long is it since he went away ? ”
150396	150445	150505	150505	She	123	“ Four days sin ’ . No one would give him work here , and he ’d to go on tramp toward Greenfield . But he might ha ’ been back afore this , or sent me some word if he ’d getten work . He might — — ”
150446	150454	150456	150456	Margaret	123	“ Oh , do n’t blame him , ”
150458	150469	150456	150456	Margaret	123	“ He felt it deeply , I ’m sure — — ”
150470	150485	150487	150487	herself	123	“ Willto ’ hold thy din , and let me hear the lady speak ! ”
150511	150560	150562	150562	she	123	“ He ’s always mithering me for ‘ daddy ’ and ‘ butty ’ ; and I ha ’ no butties to give him , and daddy ’s away , and forgotten us a ’ , I think . He ’s his father ’s darling , he is , ”
150605	150610	150612	150612	Margaret	123	“ Poor little fellow ! ”
150616	150626	150612	150612	Margaret	123	“ he _ was _ his father ’s darling . ”
150627	150637	150639	150640	the woman	3675	“ He _ is _ his father ’s darling , ”
150681	150729	150677	150677	she	358	“ He _ is _ his father ’s darling , I say . Poor folk can love their childer as well as rich . Why dunno yo ’ speak ? Why dun yo ’ stare at me wi ’ your great pitiful eyes ? Where ’s John ? ”
150744	150750	150752	150752	she	358	“ Oh , my God ! ”
150781	150786	150788	150788	she	123	“ He loved him , ”
150790	150793	150795	150796	the woman	3675	“ Ay , ”
150802	150878	150880	150880	she	3765	“ he loved us a ’ . We had some one to love us once . It ’s a long time ago ; but when he were in life and with us he did love us , he did . He loved this babby m’appen the best on us ; but he loved me and I loved him , though I was calling him five minutes agone . Are yo ’ sure he ’s dead ? ”
150887	150921	150880	150880	she	3765	“ If it ’s only that he ’s ill and like to die , they may bring him round yet . I ’m but an ailing creature mysel’—I’ve been ailing this long time . ”
150922	150932	151017	151017	her	123	“ But he is dead — he is drowned ! ”
150933	151007	151008	151008	Margaret	123	“ Folk are brought round after they ’re dead - drowned . Whatten was I thinking of , to sit still when I should be stirring mysel ’ ? Here , whisth thee , child — whisth thee ! tak ’ this , tak ’ aught to play wi ’ , but dunnot cry while my heart ’s breaking ! Oh , where is my strength gone to ? Oh John — husband ! ”
151141	151149	151151	151151	she	123	“ Open it . Open it quick , ”
151157	151199	151151	151151	she	123	“ It ’s bolted ; make no noise — be very still . Oh , papa , let them go upstairs very softly and carefully , and perhaps she will not hear them . She has fainted — that ’s all . ”
151200	151211	151213	151224	a woman following in the wake of the bearers of the dead	3771	“ It ’s as well for her , poor creature , ”
151226	151255	151256	151258	This helpful neighbour	3772	“ But yo’re not fit to hold her . Stay , I ’ll run fetch a pillow , and we ’ll let her down easy on the floor . ”
151360	151427	151342	151342	she	123	“ Can you give all these people a hint that they had better leave in quietness ? So that when she comes round , she could only find one or two that she knows about her . Papa , will you speak to the men , and get them to go away . She can not breathe , poor thing , with this crowd about her . ”
151473	151478	151480	151480	she	123	“ What is it ? ”
151482	151489	151491	151492	her father	444	“ Only our good friend here , ”
151494	151505	151491	151492	her father	444	“ hit on a capital expedient for clearing the place . ”
151506	151565	151470	151471	the woman	3675	“ I bid ’em begone , and each take a child with ’em , and to mind that they were orphans , and their mother a widow . It was who could do most , and the childer are sure of a bellyful to - day , and of kindness too . Does hoo know how he died ? ”
151566	151569	151571	151571	Margaret	123	“ No , ”
151573	151583	151571	151571	Margaret	123	“ I could not tell her all at once . ”
151584	151617	151470	151471	the woman	3675	“ Hoo mun be told because of th ’ Inquest . See ! Hoo ’s coming round ; shall you or I do it ? or m’appen your father would be best ? ”
151618	151625	151627	151627	Margaret	123	“ No ; you , you , ”
151659	151662	151664	151664	she	3785	“ Neighbour , ”
151666	151679	151664	151664	she	3785	“ your man is dead . Guess yo ’ how he died ? ”
151680	151685	151687	151688	Mrs. Boucher	358	“ He were drowned , ”
151708	151791	151664	151664	she	3785	“ He were found drowned . He were coming home very hopeless o ’ aught on earth . He thought God could na be harder than men ; m’appen not so hard ; m’appen as tender as a mother ; m’appen tenderer . I ’m not saying he did right , and I ’m not saying he did wrong . All I say is , may neither me nor mine ever have his sore heart , or we may do like things . ”
151792	151805	151807	151808	the widow	3786	“ He has left me alone wi ’ a ’ these children ! ”
151844	151848	151850	151851	Mr. Hale	134	“ Not alone , ”
151855	151868	151850	151851	Mr. Hale	134	“ Who is with you ? Who will take up your cause ? ”
151894	151906	151908	151908	he	134	“ Who has promised to be a father to the fatherless ? ”
151910	151947	151908	151908	he	134	“ But I ’ve getten six children , sir , and the eldest not eight years of age . I ’m not meaning for to doubt His power , sir,—only it needs a deal o ’ trust ”
151956	151969	151971	151972	the neighbour	3791	“ Hoo’ll be better able to talk to - morrow , sir , ”
151974	151997	151971	151972	the neighbour	3791	“ Best comfort now would be the feel of a child at her heart . I ’m sorry they took the babby . ”
151998	152005	152007	152007	Margaret	123	“ I ’ll go for it , ”
152061	152064	152066	152067	the woman	3675	“ There ! ”
152069	152136	152066	152067	the woman	3675	“ now you go . They ’ll cry together , and comfort together , better nor any one but a child can do . I ’ll stop with her as long as I ’m needed , and if you come to - morrow , you ’ can have a deal o ’ wise talk with her , that she ’s not up to to - day . ”
152156	152162	152148	152148	she	123	“ Shall we go in ? ”
152167	152175	152148	152148	she	123	“ I was thinking of him too . ”
152203	152206	152208	152208	Margaret	123	“ Nicholas ! ”
152245	152248	152250	152250	Margaret	123	“ Nicholas ! ”
152253	152267	152250	152250	Margaret	123	“ It is only us . Wo n’t you let us come in ? ”
152268	152271	152273	152273	he	202	“ No , ”
152275	152302	152273	152273	he	202	“ I spoke as plain as I could , ’bout using words , when I bolted th ’ door . Let me be , this day . ”
152320	152328	152330	152330	she	123	“ I do n’t wonder at it , ”
152332	152355	152330	152330	she	123	“ I myself long to be alone . It seems the only thing to do one good after a day like this . ”
152362	152422	152423	152423	HOOD	360	“ A spade ! a rake ! a hoe ! A pickaxe or a bill ! A hook to reap , or a scythe to mow , A flail or what ye will — And here ’s a ready hand To ply the needful tool , And skill’d enough , by lessons rough , In Labour ’s rugged school . ”
152663	152692	152693	152693	Margaret	123	“ Is yon thing upstairs really him ? it doesna look like him . I ’m feared on it , and I never was feared o ’ daddy . ”
153069	153076	153078	153078	she	123	“ It is the town life , ”
153080	153146	153078	153078	she	123	“ Their nerves are quickened by the haste and bustle and speed of everything around them , to say nothing of the confinement in these pent - up houses , which of itself is enough to induce depression and worry of spirits . Now in the country , people live so much more out of doors , even children , and even in the winter . ”
153147	153172	153057	153057	they	3834	“ But people must live in towns . And in the country some get such stagnant habits of mind that they are almost fatalists . ”
153173	153302	153057	153057	they	3834	“ Yes ; I acknowledge that . I suppose each mode of life produces its own trials and its own temptations . The dweller in towns must find it as difficult to be patient , as the country - bred man must find it to be active , and equal to unwonted emergencies . Both must find it hard to realise a future of any kind ; the one because the present is so living and hurrying and close around him ; the other because his life tempts him to revel in the mere sense of animal existence , not knowing of , and consequently not caring for any pungency of pleasure , for the attainment of which he can plan , and deny himself and look forward . ”
153303	153339	153442	153442	she	123	“ And thus both the necessity for engrossment , and the stupid content in the present , produce the same effects . But this poor Mrs. Boucher ! how little we can do for her . ”
153340	153371	153057	153057	they	3834	“ And yet we dare not leave her without our efforts , although they may seem so useless . Oh papa ! it ’s a hard world to live in ! ”
153372	153414	153442	153442	she	123	“ So it is , my child . We feel it so just now , at any rate ; but we have been very happy , even in the midst of our sorrow . What a pleasure Frederick ’s visit was ! ”
153415	153422	153424	153424	Margaret	123	“ Yes , that it was , ”
153428	153440	153424	153424	Margaret	123	“ It was such a charming , snatched , forbidden thing . ”
154107	154152	154103	154103	He	134	“ I quite expected to have seen Mr. Thornton . I think the messenger who brought the book last night must have had some note , and forgot to deliver it . Do you think there has been any message left to - day ? ”
154153	154162	154164	154164	Margaret	123	“ I will go and inquire , papa , ”
154179	154187	154188	154188	She	123	“ Stay , there ’s a ring ! ”
154238	154281	154224	154224	She	123	“ It ’s that Higgins , sir . He wants to see you , or else Miss Hale . Or it might be Miss Hale first , and then you , sir ; for he ’s in a strange kind of way . ”
154282	154309	154224	154224	She	123	“ He had better come up here , Dixon ; and then he can see us both , and choose which he likes for his listener . ”
154310	154357	154224	154224	She	123	“ Oh ! very well , sir . I ’ve no wish to hear what he ’s got to say , I ’m sure ; only , if you could see his shoes , I ’m sure you ’d say the kitchen was the fitter place . ”
154358	154367	154369	154370	Mr. Hale	134	“ He can wipe them , I suppose , ”
154430	154435	154437	154437	he	3849	“ Sarvant , sir ! ”
154450	154484	154437	154437	he	3849	“ If hoo’l excuse me ( looking at Margaret ) for being i ’ my stockings ; I’se been tramping a ’ day , and streets is none o ’ th ’ cleanest . ”
154548	154598	154599	154599	Margaret	123	“ We shall have tea up directly , and then you ’ll take a cup with us , Mr. Higgins . I am sure you are tired , if you ’ve been out much this wet relaxing day . Margaret , my dear , ca n’t you hasten tea ? ”
154691	154753	154754	154754	Higgins	333	“ Why master and you must always be asking the lower classes up - stairs , since we came to Milton , I can not understand . Folk at Helstone were never brought higher than the kitchen ; and I ’ve let one or two of them know before now that they might think it an honour to be even there . ”
154796	154799	154801	154801	he	333	“ Master , ”
154803	154839	154841	154841	he	333	“ yo’d not guess easy what I ’ve been tramping after to - day . Special if yo’d remember my manner o ’ talk yesterday . I ’ve been a seeking work . I have , ”
154843	154893	154895	154895	his	333	“ I said to mysel ’ , I ’d keep a civil tongue in my head , let who would say what ’em would . I ’d set my teeth into my tongue sooner nor speak i ’ haste . For that man ’s sake — yo ’ understand , ”
154903	154910	154912	154913	Mr. Hale	134	“ No , I do n’t , ”
154930	154933	154916	154916	he	134	“ that man ”
154937	154944	154946	154946	he	134	“ That chap as lies theer , ”
154952	154993	154946	154946	he	134	“ Him as went and drownded himself , poor chap ! I did na think he ’d got it in him to lie still and let the water creep o’er him till he died . Boucher , yo ’ know . ”
154994	155001	155003	155004	Mr. Hale	134	“ Yes , I know now , ”
155006	155023	155003	155004	Mr. Hale	134	“ Go back to what you were saying : you ’d not speak in haste — — ”
155024	155067	154946	154946	he	134	“ For his sake . Yet not for his sake ; for where’er he is , and whate’er , he ’ll ne’er know other clemming or cold again ; but for the wife ’s sake , and the bits o ’ childer . ”
155068	155073	155075	155076	Mr. Hale	134	“ God bless you ! ”
155091	155101	155086	155086	he	134	“ What do you mean ? Tell me out . ”
155102	155109	155111	155111	Higgins	333	“ I have telled yo ’ , ”
155122	155175	155176	155177	Mr. Hale	134	“ I would na ask for work for mysel ’ ; but them ’s left as a charge on me . I reckon , I would ha guided Boucher to a better end ; but I set him off o ’ th ’ road , and so I mun answer for him . ”
155198	155342	155192	155192	Higgins	333	“ Theer , theer , master ! Theer ’s ne’er a man , to call a man , amongst us , but what would do th ’ same ; ay , and better too ; for , belie ’ me , Is’e ne’er got a stroke o ’ work , nor yet a sight of any . For all I telled Hamper that , let alone his pledge — which I would not sign — no , I could na , not e’en for this — he’d ne’er ha ’ such a worker on his mill as I would be — he’d ha ’ none o ’ me — no more would none o ’ th ’ others . I ’m a poor black feckless sheep — childer may clem for ought I can do , unless , parson , yo’d help me ? ”
155343	155358	155176	155177	Mr. Hale	134	“ Help you ! How ? I would do anything,—but what can I do ? ”
155359	155361	155362	155362	Margaret	123	“ Miss there”—for
155374	155467	155362	155362	Margaret	123	listening—“has often talked grand o ’ the South , and the ways down there . Now I dunnot know how far off it is , but I been thinking if I could get ’em down theer , where food is cheap and wages good , and all the folk , rich and poor , master and man , friendly like ; yo ’ could , may be , help me to work . I ’m not forty - five , and I ’ve a deal o ’ strength in me , measter . ”
155468	155481	155176	155177	Mr. Hale	134	“ But what kind of work could you do , my man ? ”
155482	155494	155176	155177	Mr. Hale	134	“ Well , I reckon I could spade a bit — — ”
155495	155500	155502	155502	Margaret	123	“ And for that , ”
155507	155562	155502	155502	Margaret	123	“ for anything you could do , Higgins , with the best will in the world , you would , may be , get nine shillings a week ; may be ten , at the outside . Food is much the same as here , except that you might have a little garden — — ”
155563	155571	155573	155573	he	3858	“ The childer could work at that , ”
155575	155592	155573	155573	he	3858	“ I ’m sick o ’ Milton anyways , and Milton is sick o ’ me . ”
155593	155601	155603	155603	Margaret	123	“ You must not go the South , ”
155605	155659	155603	155603	Margaret	123	“ for all that . You could not stand it . You would have to be out all weathers . It would kill you with rheumatism . The mere bodily work at your time of life would break you down . The fare is far different to what you have been accustomed to . ”
155660	155668	155670	155670	he	3858	“ I’se nought particular about my meat , ”
155676	155983	155670	155670	he	3858	“ But you ’ve reckoned on having butcher ’s meat once a day , if you ’re in work ; pay for that out of your ten shillings , and keep those poor children if you can . I owe it to you — since it ’s my way of talking that has set you off on this idea — to put it all clear before you . You would not bear the dulness of the life ; you do n’t know what it is ; it would eat you away like rust . Those that have lived there all their lives , are used to soaking in the stagnant waters . They labour on from day to day , in the great solitude of steaming fields — never speaking or lifting up their poor , bent , downcast heads . The hard spadework robs their brain of life ; the sameness of their toil deadens their imagination ; they do n’t care to meet to talk over thoughts and speculations , even of the weakest , wildest kind , after their work is done ; they go home brutishly tired , poor creatures ! caring for nothing but food and rest . You could not stir them up into any companionship , which you get in a town as plentiful as the air you breathe , whether it be good or bad — and that I do n’t know ; but I do know , that you of all men are not one to bear a life among such labourers . What would be peace to them , would be eternal fretting to you . Think no more of it , Nicholas , I beg . Besides , you could never pay to get mother and children all there — that ’s one good thing . ”
155984	156032	156034	156034	he	3859	“ I ’ve reckoned for that . One house mun do for us a ’ , and the furniture o ’ t’other would go a good way . And men theer mun have their families to keep — m’appen six or seven childer . God help ’em ! ”
156077	156175	156176	156177	Mr. Hale	134	“ God help ’em ! North an ’ South have each getten their own troubles . If work ’s sure and steady theer , labour ’s paid at starvation wages ; while here we’n rucks o ’ money coming in one quarter , and ne’er a farthing th ’ next . For sure , th ’ world is in a confusion that passes me or any other man to understand ; it needs fettling , and who ’s to fettle it if it ’s as yon folks say , and there ’s nought but what we see ? ”
156330	156343	156307	156307	Margaret	123	“ Higgins have you been to Marlborough Mills to seek for work ? ”
156344	156348	156350	156350	he	202	“ Thornton ’s ? ”
156352	156361	156350	156350	he	202	“ Ay , I ’ve been at Thornton ’s ”
156362	156369	156307	156307	Margaret	123	“ And what did he say ? ”
156370	156395	156307	156307	Margaret	123	“ Such a chap as me is not like to see the measter . Th ’ o’erlooker bid me go and be d —— d. ”
156396	156405	156407	156408	Mr. Hale	134	“ I wish you had seen Mr. Thornton , ”
156410	156428	156407	156408	Mr. Hale	134	“ He might not have given you work , but he would not have used such language . ”
156429	156484	156307	156307	Margaret	123	“ As to th ’ language , I ’m welly used to it ; it dunnot matter to me . I ’m not nesh mysel ’ when I ’m put out . It were th ’ fact that I were na wanted theer , no more nor ony other place , as I minded . ”
156485	156495	156497	156497	Margaret	123	“ But I wish you had seen Mr. Thornton , ”
156499	156536	156497	156497	Margaret	123	“ Would you go again — it ’s a good deal to ask , I know — but would you go to - morrow and try him ? I should be so glad if you would . ”
156537	156548	156550	156551	Mr. Hale	134	“ I ’m afraid it would be of no use , ”
156558	156570	156550	156551	Mr. Hale	134	“ It would be better to let me speak to him . ”
156597	156754	156591	156591	He	202	“ It would tax my pride above a bit ; if it were for mysel ’ , I could stand a deal o ’ clemming first ; I ’d sooner knock him down than ask a favour from him . I ’d a deal sooner be flogged mysel ’ ; but yo’re not a common wench , axing yo’r pardon , nor yet have yo ’ common ways about yo ’ . I ’ll e’en make a wry face , and go at it to - morrow . Dunna yo ’ think that he ’ll do it . That man has it in him to be burnt at the stake afore he ’ll give in . I ’ll do it for yo’r sake , Miss Hale , and it ’s first time in my life as e’er I give way to a woman . Neither my wife nor Bess could e’er say that much again me . ”
156755	156764	156766	156766	Margaret	123	“ All the more do I thank you , ”
156770	156795	156766	156766	Margaret	123	“ Though I do n’t believe you : I believe you have just given way to wife and daughter as much as most men . ”
156796	156803	156805	156806	Mr. Hale	134	“ And as to Mr. Thornton , ”
156808	156833	156805	156806	Mr. Hale	134	“ I ’ll give you a note to him , which , I think I may venture say , will ensure you a hearing . ”
156834	156992	157015	157015	He	3864	“ I thank yo ’ kindly , sir , but I ’d as lief stand on my own bottom . I dunnot stomach the notion of having favour curried for me , by one as does n’t know the ins and outs of the quarrel . Meddling ’ twixt master and man is liker meddling ’ twixt husband and wife than aught else : it takes a deal of wisdom to do ony good . I ’ll stand guard at the lodge door . I ’ll stand there fro ’ six in the morning till I get speech on him . But I ’d liefer sweep th ’ streets , if paupers had na ’ got hold on that work . Dunna yo ’ hope , miss . There ’ll be more chance o ’ getting milk out of a flint . I wish yo ’ a very good night , and many thanks to yo ’ . ”
156993	157011	157013	157013	Margaret	123	“ You ’ll find your shoes by the kitchen fire ; I took them there to dry , ”
157039	157046	157048	157049	her father	444	“ How proud that man is ! ”
157070	157074	157076	157076	Margaret	123	“ He is , ”
157078	157095	157076	157076	Margaret	123	“ but what grand makings of a man there are in him , pride and all . ”
157096	157119	157048	157049	her father	444	“ It ’s amusing to see how he evidently respects the part in Mr. Thornton ’s character which is like his own . ”
157120	157136	157048	157049	her father	444	“ There ’s granite in all these northern people , papa , is there not ? ”
157137	157155	157076	157076	Margaret	123	“ There was none in poor Boucher , I am afraid ; none in his wife either . ”
157156	157241	157048	157049	her father	444	“ I should guess by their tones that they had Irish blood in them . I wonder what success he ’ll have to - morrow . If he and Mr. Thornton would speak out together as man to man — if Higgins would forget that Mr. Thornton was a master , and speak to him as he does to us — and if Mr. Thornton would be patient enough to listen to him with his human heart , not with his master ’s ears — ”
157242	157256	157258	157259	her father	444	“ You are getting to do Mr. Thornton justice at last , Margaret , ”
157281	157284	157286	157286	she	123	“ Oh ! ”
157288	157376	157286	157286	she	123	“ I wish I were a man , that I could go and force him to express his disapprobation , and tell him honestly that I knew I deserved it . It seems hard to lose him as a friend just when I had begun to feel his value . How tender he was with dear mamma ! If it were only for her sake , I wish he would come , and then at least I should know how much I was abased in his eyes . ”
157383	157418	157286	157286	she	123	“ Then proudly , proudly up she rose , Tho ’ the tear was in her e’e , Whate’er ye say , think what ye may , Ye ’s get na word frae me ! ”
157875	157901	157902	157902	He	179	words—“There was not a man in all that crowd for whom she would not have done as much , far more readily than for him . ”
158095	158129	158130	158130	He	179	“ Can you stop — can you sit down for a moment ? I have something to say to you , if you would give up that everlasting walk , walk , walk . ”
158142	158179	158130	158130	He	179	“ I want to speak to you about Betsy . She says she must leave us ; that her lover ’s death has so affected her spirits she ca n’t give her heart to her work . ”
158180	158194	158294	158294	he	3886	“ Very well . I suppose other cooks are to be met with . ”
158195	158234	158294	158294	he	3886	“ That ’s so like a man . It ’s not merely the cooking , it is that she knows all the ways of the house . Besides , she tells me something about your friend Miss Hale . ”
158235	158250	158130	158130	He	179	“ Miss Hale is no friend of mine . Mr. Hale is my friend . ”
158251	158277	158294	158294	he	3886	“ I am glad to hear you say so , for if she had been your friend , what Betsy says would have annoyed you . ”
158278	158284	158286	158286	he	3886	“ Let me hear it , ”
158304	158331	158286	158286	he	3886	“ Betsy says , that the night on which her lover — I forget his name — for she always calls him ‘ he ’ — — ”
158332	158335	158294	158294	he	3886	“ Leonards . ”
158336	158384	158294	158294	he	3886	“ The night on which Leonards was last seen at the station — when he was last seen on duty , in fact — Miss Hale was there , walking about with a young man who , Bessy believes , killed Leonards by some blow or push . ”
158385	158396	158286	158286	he	3886	“ Leonards was not killed by any blow or push . ”
158397	158403	158294	158294	he	3886	“ How do you know ? ”
158404	158476	158294	158294	he	3886	“ Because I distinctly put the question to the surgeon of the Infirmary . He told me there was an internal disease of long standing , caused by Leonards ’ habit of drinking to excess ; that the fact of his becoming rapidly worse while in a state of intoxication , settled the question as to whether the last fatal attack was caused by excess of drinking , or the fall . ”
158477	158484	158286	158286	he	3886	“ The fall ! What fall ? ”
158485	158497	158294	158294	he	3886	“ Caused by the blow or push of which Betsy speaks . ”
158498	158507	158294	158294	he	3886	“ Then there was a blow or push ? ”
158508	158513	158286	158286	he	3886	“ I believe so . ”
158514	158520	158294	158294	he	3886	“ And who did it ? ”
158521	158542	158294	158294	he	3886	“ As there was no inquest , in consequence of the doctor ’s opinion , I can not tell you . ”
158543	158550	158286	158286	he	3886	“ But Miss Hale was there ? ”
158554	158561	158286	158286	he	3886	“ And with a young man ? ”
158571	158594	158568	158568	he	3887	“ I tell you , mother , that there was no inquest — no inquiry . No judicial inquiry , I mean . ”
158595	158639	158294	158294	he	3886	“ Betsy says that Woolmer ( some man she knows , who is in a grocer ’s shop out at Crampton ) can swear that Miss Hale was at the station at that hour , walking backwards and forwards with a young man . ”
158640	158662	158294	158294	he	3886	“ I do n’t see what we have to do with that . Miss Hale is at liberty to please herself . ”
158663	158673	158675	158676	Mrs. Thornton	216	“ I ’m glad to hear you say so , ”
158680	158740	158294	158294	he	3886	“ It certainly signifies very little to us — not at all to you , after what has passed ! but I — I made a promise to Mrs. Hale , that I would not allow her daughter to go wrong without advising and remonstrating with her . I shall certainly let her know my opinion of such conduct . ”
158741	158755	158757	158758	Mr. Thornton	179	“ I do not see any harm in what she did that evening , ”
158786	158857	158770	158770	he	179	“ You would not have approved of Fanny ’s being seen out , after dark , in rather a lonely place , walking about with a young man . I say nothing of the taste which could choose the time , when her mother lay unburied , for such a promenade . Should you have liked your sister to have been noticed by a grocer ’s assistant for doing so ? ”
158858	158972	158757	158758	Mr. Thornton	179	“ In the first place , as it is not many years since I myself was a draper ’s assistant , the mere circumstance of a grocer ’s assistant noticing any act does not alter the character of the act to me . And in the next place , I see a great deal of difference between Miss Hale and Fanny . I can imagine that the one may have weighty reasons , which may and ought to make her overlook any seeming impropriety in her conduct . I never knew Fanny have weighty reasons for anything . Other people must guard her . I believe Miss Hale is a guardian to herself . ”
158973	159058	159059	159059	He	3890	“ A pretty character of your sister , indeed ! Really , John , one would have thought Miss Hale had done enough to make you clear - sighted . She drew you on to an offer , by a bold display of pretended regard for you,—to play you off against this very young man , I ’ve no doubt . Her whole conduct is clear to me now . You believe he is her lover , I suppose — you agree to that . ”
159074	159087	159066	159066	his	3890	“ Yes , mother . I do believe he is her lover . ”
159128	159230	159123	159123	he	3890	“ Mother . He is her lover , whoever he is ; but she may need help and womanly counsel;—there may be difficulties or temptations which I do n’t know . I fear there are . I do n’t want to know what they are ; but as you have ever been a good — ay ! and a tender mother to me , go to her , and gain her confidence , and tell her what is best to be done . I know that something is wrong ; some dread , which must be a terrible torture to her . ”
159231	159239	159241	159242	his mother	5657	“ For God ’s sake , John ! ”
159248	159264	159241	159242	his mother	5657	“ what do you mean ? What do you mean ? What do you know ? ”
159272	159301	159265	159265	He	3890	“ John ! I do n’t know what I sha n’t think unless you speak . You have no right to say what you have done against her . ”
159302	159318	159241	159242	his mother	5657	“ Not against her , mother ! I _ could _ not speak against her . ”
159319	159350	159388	159388	he	3890	“ Well ! you have no right to say what you have done , unless you say more . These half - expressions are what ruin a woman ’s character . ”
159351	159362	159363	159363	he	3890	“ Her character ! Mother , you do not dare — ”
159391	159509	159388	159388	he	3890	“ I will not say any more than this , which is neither more nor less than the simple truth , and I am sure you believe me,—I have good reason to believe , that Miss Hale is in some strait and difficulty connected with an attachment which , of itself , from my knowledge of Miss Hale ’s character , is perfectly innocent and right . What my reason is , I refuse to tell . But never let me hear any one say a word against her , implying any more serious imputation than that she now needs the counsel of some kind and gentle woman . You promised Mrs. Hale to be that woman ! ”
159510	159513	159515	159516	Mrs. Thornton	216	“ No ! ”
159518	159647	159515	159516	Mrs. Thornton	216	“ I am happy to say , I did not promise kindness and gentleness , for I felt at the time that it might be out of my power to render these to one of Miss Hale ’s character and disposition . I promised counsel and advice , such as I would give to my own daughter ; I shall speak to her as I would do to Fanny , if she had gone gallivanting with a young man in the dusk . I shall speak with relation to the circumstances I know , without being influenced either one way or another by the ‘ strong reasons ’ which you will not confide to me . Then I shall have fulfilled my promise , and done my duty . “
159654	159659	159660	159660	She	3894	” said he passionately . “
159677	159678	159668	159668	I	0	” “
159681	159688	159660	159660	She	3894	” said he , breaking away , “
159736	159754	159785	159785	Margaret	123	” continued he , between his teeth , as he bolted himself into his own private room . “
159828	159870	159872	159872	her	3894	” The more Mrs. Thornton thought over what her son had said , in pleading for a merciful judgment for Margaret ’s indiscretion , the more bitterly she felt inclined towards her . She took a savage pleasure in the idea of “
159874	159897	159872	159872	her	3894	” to her , in the guise of fulfilment of a duty . She enjoyed the thought of showing herself untouched by the “
159900	159969	159872	159872	her	3894	” which she was well aware Margaret had the power of throwing over many people . She snorted scornfully over the picture of the beauty of her victim ; her jet black hair , her clear smooth skin , her lucid eyes would not help to save her one word of the just and stern reproach which Mrs. Thornton spent half the night in preparing to her mind . “
159975	160348	159971	159972	Miss Hale	187	” She knew she was , for she had seen her at the window , and she had her feet inside the little hall before Martha had half answered the question . Margaret was sitting alone , writing to Edith , and giving her many particulars of her mother ’s last days . It was a softening employment , and she had to brush away the unbidden tears as Mrs. Thornton was announced . She was so gentle and ladylike in her mode of reception that her visitor was somewhat daunted ; and it became impossible to utter the speech , so easy of arrangement with no one to address it to . Margaret ’s low rich voice was softer than usual ; her manner more gracious , because in her heart she was feeling very grateful to Mrs. Thornton for the courteous attention of her call . She exerted herself to find subjects of interest for conversation ; praised Martha , the servant whom Mrs. Thornton had found for them : had asked Edith for a little Greek air , about which she had spoken to Miss Thornton . Mrs. Thornton was fairly discomfited . Her sharp Damascus blade seemed out of place , and useless among rose - leaves . She was silent because she was trying to task herself up to her duty . At last she stung herself into its performance by a suspicion which , in spite of all probability , she allowed to cross her mind , that all this sweetness was put on with a view of propitiating Mr. Thornton ; that , somehow , the other attachment had fallen through , and that it suited Miss Hale ’s purpose to recall her rejected lover . Poor Margaret ! there was perhaps so much truth in the suspicion as this ; that Mrs. Thornton was the mother of one whose regard she valued , and feared to have lost ; and this thought unconsciously added to her natural desire of pleasing one who was showing her kindness by her visit . Mrs. Thornton stood up to go , but yet she seemed to have something more to say . She cleared her throat and began : “
160415	160533	160388	160388	she	5268	” Margaret stood before her , blushing like any culprit , with her eyes dilating as she gazed at Mrs. Thornton . She thought she had come to speak to her about the falsehood she had told — that Mr. Thornton had employed her to explain the danger she had exposed herself to , of being confuted in full court ! and although her heart sank to think he had not rather chosen to come himself , and upbraid her , and receive her penitence , and restore her again to his good opinion , yet she was too much humbled not to bear any blame on this subject patiently and meekly . Mrs. Thornton went on : “
160615	160718	160609	160609	her	3906	” Margaret ’s eyes flashed fire . This was a new idea — this was too insulting . If Mrs. Thornton had spoken to her about the lie she had told , well and good — she would have owned it , and humiliated herself . But to interfere with her conduct — to speak of her character ! she — Mrs. Thornton , a mere stranger — it was too impertinent ! She would not answer her — not one word . Mrs. Thornton saw the battle - spirit in Margaret ’s eyes , and it called up her combativeness also . “
160765	160766	160768	160769	my mother	5749	” “
160773	160782	160768	160769	my mother	5749	” said Margaret , in a tearful voice , “
160809	160810	160795	160795	She	5749	” “
160816	160817	160813	160814	Miss Hale	187	” “
160822	160828	160820	160820	madam	1676	” said Margaret more steadily , “
160848	160861	160820	160820	madam	1676	” said she , breaking down , and covering her face with her hands—“I
160872	160873	160865	160866	Mr. Thornton	179	” “
160879	160909	160876	160877	Miss Hale	187	” said Mrs. Thornton , her truthfulness causing her to arrest the confession Margaret was on the point of making , though her curiosity was itching to hear it . “
161077	161104	161071	161071	he	179	” Margaret ’s face was still hidden in her hands , the fingers of which were wet with tears . Mrs. Thornton was a little mollified . “
161132	161171	161172	161172	I	0	” Still no answer . Margaret was considering what to say ; she wished to stand well with Mrs. Thornton ; and yet she could not , might not , give any explanation . Mrs. Thornton grew impatient . “
161215	161216	161217	161217	I	0	” “
161224	161233	161217	161217	I	0	” said Margaret , in a low voice . “
161259	161270	161252	161253	Mr. Thornton	179	you;”—she had hard work to keep herself from choking with her tears—“but
161283	161284	161277	161277	you	1676	” “
161288	161297	161286	161286	you	5653	” said Mrs. Thornton , drawing herself up ; “
161426	161453	161454	161454	He	5653	” Margaret winced , and drew in her breath with a long , hissing sound ; of which , however , Mrs. Thornton took no notice . “
161495	161496	161499	161499	you	0	” “
161506	161528	161499	161499	you	0	” asked Margaret , throwing her head back with proud disdain , till her throat curved outwards like a swan ’s . “
161557	161677	161548	161548	You	0	” And she swept out of it with the noiseless grace of an offended princess . Mrs. Thornton had quite enough of natural humour to make her feel the ludricrousness of the position in which she was left . There was nothing for it but to show herself out . She was not particularly annoyed at Margaret ’s way of behaving . She did not care enough for her for that . She had taken Mrs. Thornton ’s remonstrance to the full as keenly to heart as that lady expected ; and Margaret ’s passion at once mollified her visitor , far more than any silence or reserve could have done . It showed the effect of her words . “
161682	161689	161548	161548	You	0	” thought Mrs. Thornton to herself ; “
161843	162070	161833	161833	She	218	” Mr. Thornton was not spending the morning so satisfactorily as his mother . She , at any rate , was fulfilling her determined purpose . He was trying to understand where he stood ; what damage the strike had done him . A good deal of his capital was locked up in new and expensive machinery ; and he had also bought cotton largely , with a view to some great orders which he had in hand . The strike had thrown him terribly behindhand , as to the completion of these orders . Even with his own accustomed and skilled workpeople , he would have had some difficulty in fulfilling his engagements ; as it was , the incompetence of the Irish hands , who had to be trained to their work , at a time requiring unusual activity , was a daily annoyance . It was not a favourable hour for Higgins to make his request . But he had promised Margaret to do it at any cost . So , though every moment added to his repugnance , his pride , and his sullenness of temper , he stood leaning against the dead wall , hour after hour , first on one leg , then on the other . At last the latch was sharply lifted , and out came Mr. Thornton . “
162082	162083	162071	162071	I	0	” “
162100	162101	162092	162092	I	0	” “
162117	162149	162150	162151	the measter	3941	” Mr. Thornton was half way down the street . Higgins sighed . But it was no use . To catch him in the street , was his only chance of seeing “
162153	162230	162150	162151	the measter	3941	” if he had rung the lodge bell or even gone up to the house to ask for him , he would have been referred to the overlooker . So he stood still again , vouchsafing no answer , but a short nod of recognition to the few men who knew and spoke to him , as the crowd drove out the millyard at dinner - time , and scowling with all his might at the Irish “
162232	162245	162248	162248	you	3942	” who had just been imported . At last Mr. Thornton returned . “
162252	162253	162248	162248	you	3942	” “
162265	162266	162258	162258	I	0	” “
162308	162337	162297	162299	These good people	3947	” said he , closing the door of the porter ’s lodge . He stopped to speak to the overlooker . The latter said in a low tone : “
162367	162368	162359	162359	he	5543	” “
162375	162399	162371	162371	I	0	” said Mr. Thornton , looking round sharply at his follower . Higgins was known to him by name as a turbulent spirit . “
162403	162415	162418	162421	men such as this	3953	” said he , and his tone was rougher than before . “
162423	162427	162418	162421	men such as this	3953	” thought he , “

But , looking out of the window a minute later , he was struck with the lean , bent figure going out of the yard ; the heavy walk was in strange contrast with the resolute , clear determination of the man to speak to him . He crossed to the porter ’s lodge : “
163777	163778	163779	163779	He	5543	” “
163799	163800	163792	163792	he	5543	” “

163887	164006	164011	164011	her	4003	” DRAYTON . Margaret shut herself up in her own room , after she had quitted Mrs. Thornton . She began to walk backwards and forwards , in her old habitual way of showing agitation ; but , then , remembering that in that slightly - built house every step was heard from one room to another , she sate down until she heard Mrs. Thornton go safely out of the house . She forced herself to recollect all the conversation that had passed between them ; speech by speech , she compelled her memory to go through with it . At the end , she rose up , and said to herself , in a melancholy tone : “
164097	164137	164138	164138	He	4006	” She lifted up her head , as if she took pride in any delicacy of feeling which Mr. Thornton had shown . Then , as a new thought came across her , she pressed her hands tightly together : “
164150	164163	164164	164164	I	0	” ( She blushed as the word passed through her mind . ) “
164421	164430	164431	164431	I	0	” said she , springing to her feet . “
164498	164544	164545	164545	I	0	” All this time she was hastily putting on her things to go out , only stopping from time to time to wipe her eyes , with an impatience of gesture at the tears that would come again , in spite of all her bravery . “
164694	164733	164689	164689	he	4014	” She went out , going rapidly towards the country , and trying to drown reflection by swiftness of motion . As she stood on the door - step , at her return , her father came up : “
164737	164741	164734	164735	Good girl	4016	” said he . “
164766	164767	164770	164770	papa	528	” “
164776	164782	164787	164787	her	358	” said Margaret , reddening . “
164807	165018	164797	164797	I	0	” Accordingly Margaret went . Mrs. Boucher was very ill ; really ill — not merely ailing . The kind and sensible neighbour , who had come in the other day , seemed to have taken charge of everything . Some of the children were gone to the neighbours . Mary Higgins had come for the three youngest at dinner - time ; and since then Nicholas had gone for the doctor . He had not come as yet ; Mrs. Boucher was dying ; and there was nothing to do but wait . Margaret thought that she should like to hear his opinion , and that she could not do better than go and see the Higginses in the meantime . She might then possibly hear whether Nicholas had been able to make his application to Mr. Thornton . She found Nicholas busily engaged in making a penny spin on the dresser , for the amusement of three little children , who were clinging to him in a fearless manner . He , as well as they , was smiling at a good long spin ; and Margaret thought , that the happy look of interest in his occupation was a good sign . When the penny stopped spinning , “
165021	165026	164797	164797	I	0	” began to cry . “
165031	165075	164797	164797	I	0	” said Margaret , taking him off the dresser , and holding him in her arms ; she held her watch to his ear , while she asked Nicholas if he had seen Mr. Thornton . The look on his face changed instantly . “
165078	165082	164797	164797	I	0	” said he . “
165093	165094	165083	165083	I	0	” “
165101	165107	165095	165095	He	359	” said Margaret , sorrowfully . “
165156	165157	165152	165152	I	0	” “
165182	165183	165180	165180	he	359	” “
165191	165213	165184	165184	He	359	” said Nicholas , spinning the penny again , as much for his own amusement as for that of the children . “
165285	165286	165287	165287	You	0	” “
165294	165295	165287	165287	You	0	” “
165340	165341	165314	165314	I	0	” “
165346	165350	165352	165352	I	0	” asked Margaret . “
165409	165429	165430	165430	I	0	” Margaret put the struggling Johnnie out of her arms , back into his former place on the dresser . “
165449	165572	165447	165447	him	179	” There was a slight noise behind her . Both she and Nicholas turned round at the same moment , and there stood Mr. Thornton , with a look of displeased surprise upon his face . Obeying her swift impulse , Margaret passed out before him , saying not a word , only bowing low to hide the sudden paleness that she felt had come over her face . He bent equally low in return , and then closed the door after her . As she hurried to Mrs. Boucher ’s , she heard the clang , and it seemed to fill up the measure of her mortification . He too was annoyed to find her there . He had tenderness in his heart—“a
165576	165940	165447	165447	him	179	” as Nicholas Higgins called it ; but he had some pride in concealing it ; he kept it very sacred and safe , and was jealous of every circumstance that tried to gain admission . But if he dreaded exposure of his tenderness , he was equally desirous that all men should recognise his justice ; and he felt that he had been unjust in giving so scornful a hearing to any one who had waited , with humble patience , for five hours , to speak to him . That the man had spoken saucily to him when he had the opportunity , was nothing to Mr. Thornton . He rather liked him for it ; and he was conscious of his own irritability of temper at the time , which probably made them both quits . It was the five hours of waiting that struck Mr. Thornton . He had not five hours to spare , himself ; but one hour — two hours , of his hard penetrating intellectual , as well as bodily labour , did he give up to going about collecting evidence as to the truth of Higgins ’s story , the nature of his character , the tenor of his life . He tried not to be , but was convinced that all that Higgins had said was true . And then the conviction went in , as if by some spell , and touched the latent tenderness of his heart ; the patience of the man , the simple generosity of the motive ( for he had learnt about the quarrel between Boucher and Higgins ) , made him forget entirely the mere reasonings of justice , and overleap them by a diviner instinct . He came to tell Higgins he would give him work ; and he was more annoyed to find Margaret there than by hearing her last words ; for then he understood that she was the woman who had urged Higgins to come to him ; and he dreaded the admission of any thought of her , as a motive to what he was doing solely because it was right . “
165953	165960	165950	165951	a woman	1521	” said he indignantly to Higgins . “
165970	165971	165961	165961	You	4034	” “
166019	166020	166023	166023	you	4034	” “

166069	166101	166067	166067	yours	4034	” Mr. Thornton had a pretty good notion whose they were , from what he had heard ; but he felt awkward in turning the conversation round from this unpromising beginning . “
166112	166113	166110	166110	mine	0	” “
166126	166127	166118	166118	you	4034	” “
166133	166146	166129	166129	yo	4034	” replied Higgins , turning round , with ill - smothered fierceness , “
166172	166185	166165	166165	Measter	4040	” Mr. Thornton was silent for a moment ; then he said : “
166258	166291	166253	166253	I	0	” Higgins did not turn round , or immediately respond to this . But when he did speak , it was in a softened tone , although the words were gruff enough . “
166319	166320	166374	166374	Yo’ve	4040	” “
166340	166373	166374	166374	Yo’ve	4040	” Higgins ’s obstinacy wavered , recovered strength , and stood firm . He would not speak . Mr. Thornton would not ask again . Higgins ’s eye fell on the children . “
166461	166462	166451	166451	yo	4040	” “
166465	166474	166451	166451	yo	4040	” said Mr. Thornton , half - laughing , “
166512	166513	166496	166496	We	4050	” “
166518	166524	166496	166496	We	4050	” said Higgins , reflectively . “
166607	166627	166605	166605	me	0	” said he , more frankly , suddenly turning round and facing Mr. Thornton fully for the first time . “
166636	166649	166634	166634	me	0	” said Mr. Thornton , giving Higgins ’s hand a good grip . “
166659	166667	166652	166652	you	4040	” continued he , resuming the master . “
166709	166710	166711	166711	Yo	4040	” “

166808	166954	166956	166956	me	0	” Just before Mr. Thornton came up to Mrs. Boucher ’s door , Margaret came out of it . She did not see him ; and he followed her for several yards , admiring her light and easy walk , and her tall and graceful figure . But , suddenly , this simple emotion of pleasure was tainted , poisoned by jealousy . He wished to overtake her , and speak to her , to see how she would receive him , now she must know he was aware of some other attachment . He wished too , but of this wish he was rather ashamed , that she should know that he had justified her wisdom in sending Higgins to him to ask for work , and had repented him of his morning ’s decision . He came up to her . She started . “
166979	166980	166976	166976	Higgins	202	” “
166987	166992	166993	166993	He	202	” said she coldly . “
167010	167020	167003	167003	I	0	” Mr. Thornton hesitated . Margaret took it up : “
167050	167059	167060	167060	Higgins	202	” she went on a little more eagerly , “
167070	167073	167060	167060	Higgins	202	” The word “
167076	167121	167060	167060	Higgins	202	” reminded her of her own untruth , and she stopped short , feeling exceedingly uncomfortable . Mr. Thornton at first was puzzled to account for her silence ; and then he remembered the lie she had told , and all that was foregone . “
167126	167130	167060	167060	Higgins	202	” said he . “
167169	167192	167159	167159	You	187	” Margaret was silent . She was wondering whether an explanation of any kind would be consistent with her loyalty to Frederick . “
167195	167199	167159	167159	You	187	” said he , “
167278	167279	167273	167273	I	0	” “
167286	167301	167280	167280	I	0	” said Margaret , forcing herself to speak in an indifferent , careless way . “
167332	167333	167322	167322	I	0	” “
167348	167356	167334	167334	I	0	” he said , with growing anger . “
167417	167418	167410	167410	You	187	” “
167421	167429	167410	167410	You	187	” said Margaret , quietly and sadly . “
167494	167501	167504	167504	he	4065	” He walked off very hastily . “
167507	167509	167511	167511	he	4065	” thought Margaret,—“what
167650	168267	168268	168268	I	0	” Her father was almost startled by her merriment this morning . She talked incessantly , and forced her natural humour to an unusual pitch ; and if there was a tinge of bitterness in much of what she said ; if her accounts of the old Harley Street set were a little sarcastic , her father could not bear to check her , as he would have done at another time — for he was glad to see her shake off her cares . In the middle of the evening , she was called down to speak to Mary Higgins ; and when she came back , Mr. Hale imagined that he saw traces of tears on her cheeks . But that could not be , for she brought good news — that Higgins had got work at Mr. Thornton ’s mill . Her spirits were damped , at any rate , and she found it very difficult to go on talking at all , much more in the wild way that she had done . For some days her spirits varied strangely ; and her father was beginning to be anxious about her , when news arrived from one or two quarters that promised some change and variety for her . Mr. Hale received a letter from Mr. Bell , in which that gentleman volunteered a visit to them ; and Mr. Hale imagined that the promised society of his old Oxford friend would give as agreeable a turn to Margaret ’s ideas as it did to his own . Margaret tried to take an interest in what pleased her father ; but she was too languid to care about any Mr. Bell , even though he were twenty times her godfather . She was more roused by a letter from Edith , full of sympathy about her aunt ’s death ; full of details about herself , her husband , and child ; and at the end saying , that as the climate did not suit the baby , and as Mrs. Shaw was talking of returning to England , she thought it probable that Captain Lennox might sell out , and that they might all go and live again in the old Harley Street house ; which , however , would seem very incomplete without Margaret . Margaret yearned after that old house , and the placid tranquility of that well - ordered , monotonous life . She had found it occasionally tiresome while it lasted ; but since then she had been buffeted about , and felt so exhausted by this recent struggle with herself , that she thought that even stagnation would be a rest and a refreshment . So she began to look towards a long visit to the Lennoxes , on their return to England , as to a point — no , not of hope — but of leisure , in which she could regain her power and command over herself . At present it seemed to her as if all subjects tended towards Mr. Thornton ; as if she could not forget him with all her endeavours . If she went to see the Higginses , she heard of him there ; her father had resumed their readings together , and quoted his opinions perpetually ; even Mr. Bell ’s visit brought his tenant ’s name upon the tapis ; for he wrote word , that he believed he must be occupied some great part of his time with Mr. Thornton , as a new lease was in preparation , and the terms of it must be agreed upon . CHAPTER XL . OUT OF TUNE . “
168321	168436	168448	168448	I	0	” WYATT . Margaret had not expected much pleasure to herself from Mr. Bell ’s visit — she had only looked forward to it on her father ’s account , but when her godfather came , she at once fell into the most natural position of friendship in the world . He said she had no merit in being what she was , a girl so entirely after his own heart : it was an hereditary power which she had , to walk in and take possession of his regard ; while she , in reply , gave him much credit for being so fresh and young under his Fellow ’s cap and gown . “

168941	168949	168933	168934	Mr. Thornton	179	” asked Margaret in a low voice . “
168969	169452	168962	168962	He	179	” Mr. Thornton had determined that he would make no inquiry of his mother as to how far she had put her project into execution of speaking to Margaret about the impropriety of her conduct . He felt pretty sure that , if this interview took place , his mother ’s account of what passed at it would only annoy and chagrin him , though he would all the time be aware of the colouring which it received by passing through her mind . He shrank from hearing Margaret ’s very name mentioned ; he , while he blamed her — while he was jealous of her — while he renounced her — he loved her sorely , in spite of himself . He dreamt of her ; he dreamt she came dancing towards him with outspread arms , and with a lightness and gaiety which made him loathe her , even while it allured him . But the impression of this figure of Margaret — with all Margaret ’s character taken out of it , as completely as if some evil spirit had got possession of her form — was so deeply stamped upon his imagination , that when he wakened he felt hardly able to separate the Una from the Duessa ; and the dislike he had to the latter seemed to envelop and disfigure the former . Yet he was too proud to acknowledge his weakness by avoiding the sight of her . He would neither seek an opportunity of being in her company nor avoid it . To convince himself of his power of self - control , he lingered over every piece of business this afternoon ; he forced every movement into unnatural slowness and deliberation ; and it was consequently past eight o’clock before he reached Mr. Hale ’s . Then there were business arrangements to be transacted in the study with Mr. Bell ; and the latter kept on , sitting over the fire , and talking wearily , long after all business was transacted , and when they might just as well have gone upstairs . But Mr. Thornton would not say a word about moving their quarters ; he chafed and chafed , and thought Mr. Bell a most prosy companion ; while Mr. Bell returned the compliment in secret , by considering Mr. Thornton about as brusque and curt a fellow as he had ever met with , and terribly gone off both in intelligence and manner . At last some slight noise in the room above suggested the desirableness of moving there . They found Margaret with a letter open before her , eagerly discussing its contents with her father . On the entrance of the gentlemen , it was immediately put aside ; but Mr. Thornton ’s eager senses caught some few words of Mr. Hale ’s to Mr. Bell . “
169465	169513	169514	169514	We	4097	” Mr. Bell nodded . Margaret was red as a rose when Mr. Thornton looked at her . He had the greatest mind in the world to get up and go out of the room that very instant , and never set foot in the house again . “
169518	169523	169514	169514	We	4097	” said Mr. Hale , “
169552	169553	169544	169544	you	4098	” “
169588	169612	169579	169579	you	4098	” Mr. Thornton had not a notion what they were talking about , and disdained to inquire . Mr. Hale politely enlightened him . “
169658	169659	169636	169636	we	4097	” “
169691	169692	169689	169689	Margaret	123	” “

169794	169795	169780	169780	your	179	” “

169875	169885	169886	169886	I	0	” Mr. Thornton was silent . Then he said , “
169903	169904	169898	169898	I	0	” “
169908	169909	169898	169898	I	0	” “
169941	169942	169934	169934	I	0	” “
169945	169950	169934	169934	I	0	” said Mr. Hale ; “
169979	169980	169981	169981	I	0	” “
170031	170032	170020	170020	you	179	” “
170059	170060	170052	170057	the representative man of its inhabitants	4116	” “
170088	170126	170071	170071	you	179	” Margaret saw the quick glance of surprise that Mr. Thornton gave her , and she was annoyed at the construction which he might put on this speech of Mr. Bell ’s . Mr. Bell went on — “
170187	170267	170183	170185	a Milton man	4091	” Mr. Thornton was annoyed more than he ought to have been at all that Mr. Bell was saying . He was not in a mood for joking . At another time , he could have enjoyed Mr. Bell ’s half testy condemnation of a town where the life was so at variance with every habit he had formed ; but now , he was galled enough to attempt to defend what was never meant to be seriously attacked . “
170281	170282	170268	170268	I	0	” “
170287	170293	170268	170268	I	0	” slyly asked Mr. Bell . “
170308	170309	170296	170296	We	4124	” “
170319	170326	170296	170296	We	4124	” said Mr. Hale , gently . “
170342	170343	170327	170327	They	4125	” “
170349	170354	170327	170327	They	4125	” said Mr. Thornton . “
170553	170554	170541	170541	We	4124	” “
170597	170598	170590	170590	You	4130	” “
170752	170753	170737	170749	others , who so ready to cry , ‘ Fie , for shame	4136	” “
170792	170800	170801	170801	I	0	” Mr. Thornton laughed outright at this . “
170863	170864	170958	170958	she	131	” “
170869	170874	170879	170879	you	4130	” said Mr. Bell . “
170889	170955	170956	170956	Edith	131	” Margaret felt , rather than saw , that Mr. Thornton was chagrined by the repeated turning into jest of what he was feeling as very serious . She tried to change the conversation from a subject about which one party cared little , while , to the other , it was deeply , because personally , interesting . She forced herself to say something . “
170972	170973	170975	170975	she	131	” “
170977	170982	170975	170975	she	131	” said her father , “
171002	171003	170995	170995	you	4130	” “
171013	171014	171007	171007	she	131	” “
171023	171028	171029	171029	Margaret	123	” said Mr. Bell . “
171062	171063	171051	171051	I	0	” “
171072	171355	171356	171356	her	4141	” said Mr. Thornton , bitterly . The moment he had done so , he could have bitten his tongue out . What was he ? And why should he stab her with her shame in this way ? How evil he was to - night : possessed by ill - humour at being detained so long from her ; irritated by the mention of some name , because he thought it belonged to a more successful lover ; now ill - tempered because he had been unable to cope , with a light heart , against one who was trying , by gay and careless speeches , to make the evening pass pleasantly away,—the kind old friend to all parties , whose manner by this time might be well known to Mr. Thornton , who had been acquainted with him for many years . And then to speak to Margaret as he had done ! She did not get up and leave the room , as she had done in former days , when his abruptness or his temper had annoyed her . She sat quite still , after the first momentary glance of grieved surprise , that made her eyes look like some child ’s who has met with an unexpected rebuff ; they slowly dilated into mournful , reproachful sadness ; and then they fell , and she bent over her work , and did not speak again . But he could not help looking at her , and he saw a sigh tremble over her body , as if she quivered in some unwonted chill . He felt as the mother would have done , in the midst of “
171364	171756	171356	171356	her	4141	” had she been called away before her slow confiding smile , implying perfect trust in mother ’s love , had proved the renewing of its love . He gave short sharp answers ; he was uneasy and cross , unable to discern between jest and earnest ; anxious only for a look , a word of hers , before which to prostrate himself in penitent humility . But she neither looked nor spoke . Her round taper fingers flew in and out of her sewing , as steadily and swiftly as if that were the business of her life . She could not care for him , he thought , or else the passionate fervour of his wish would have forced her to raise those eyes , if but for an instant , to read the late repentance in his . He could have struck her before he left , in order that by some strange overt act of rudeness , he might earn the privilege of telling her the remorse that gnawed at his heart . It was well that the long walk in the open air wound up this evening for him . It sobered him back into grave resolution that henceforth he would see as little of her as possible,—since the very sight of that face and form , the very sounds of that voice ( like the soft winds of pure melody ) had such power to move him from his balance . Well ! He had known what love was — a sharp pang , a fierce experience , in the midst of whose flames he was struggling ! but , through the furnace he would fight his way out into the serenity of middle age,—all the richer and more human for having known this great passion . When he had somewhat abruptly left the room , Margaret rose from her seat , and began silently to fold up her work . The long seams were heavy , and had an unusual weight for her languid arms . The round lines in her face took a lengthened , straighter form , and her whole appearance was that of one who had gone through a day of great fatigue . As the three prepared for bed , Mr. Bell muttered a little condemnation of Mr. Thornton . “
171817	171818	171819	171819	He	4142	” “
171825	171841	171819	171819	He	4142	” said Margaret , turning round from the table , and speaking with quiet distinctness . “
171862	171897	171898	171898	Hale	187	” Mr. Bell gave her one of his sharp glances from above his spectacles . She stood it quite calmly ; but , after she had left the room , he suddenly asked , — “
171923	171924	171912	171913	the French	4146	” “
171927	171942	171912	171913	the French	4146	” said Mr. Hale , first startled and then flurried by the new idea . “
171998	171999	171992	171992	she	7310	” “
172040	172041	172043	172043	I	0	” “
172050	172055	172046	172046	you	4143	” said Mr. Hale . “
172097	172098	172100	172100	her	123	” “
172168	172241	172156	172156	I	0	” But Mr. Hale resolved that he would not be disturbed by any such nonsensical idea ; so he lay awake , determining not to think about it . Mr. Bell took his leave the next day , bidding Margaret look to him as one who had a right to help and protect her in all her troubles , of whatever nature they might be . To Mr. Hale he said , — “
172337	172338	172339	172339	I	0	” “
172363	172364	172357	172357	I	0	” “
172509	172510	172504	172504	you	4150	” “
172513	172520	172504	172504	you	4150	” said Mr. Hale , decidedly . “
172555	172556	172557	172557	I	0	” “
172630	172873	172626	172626	God	174	” So they fell back into the monotony of the quiet life they would henceforth lead . There was no invalid to hope and fear about ; even the Higginses — so long a vivid interest — seemed to have receded from any need of immediate thought . The Boucher children , left motherless orphans , claimed what of Margaret ’s care she could bestow ; and she went pretty often to see Mary Higgins , who had charge of them . The two families were living in one house : the elder children were at humble schools , the younger ones were tended , in Mary ’s absence at her work , by the kind neighbour whose good sense had struck Margaret at the time of Boucher ’s death . Of course she was paid for her trouble ; and , indeed , in all his little plans and arrangements for these orphan children , Nicholas showed a sober judgment , and regulated method of thinking , which were at variance with his former more eccentric jerks of action . He was so steady at his work , that Margaret did not often see him during these winter months ; but when she did , she saw that he winced away from any reference to the father of those children , whom he had so fully and heartily taken under his care . He did not speak easily of Mr. Thornton . “
172879	172883	172884	172884	he	4168	” said he , “
173062	173063	173046	173046	he	4168	” “
173071	173076	173066	173066	he	4168	” asked Mr. Hale . “
173177	173178	173158	173158	He	4168	” “
173181	173197	173158	173158	He	4168	they”—began Mr. Hale ; but Margaret , touching his arm , showed him her watch . “
173203	173207	173158	173158	He	4168	” she said . “
173219	173458	173217	173217	papa	528	” She did not breathe freely till they were some distance from the house . Then , as she became more calm , she wished that she had not been in so great a hurry ; for , somehow , they saw Mr. Thornton but very seldom now ; and he might have come to see Higgins , and for the old friendship ’s sake she should like to have seen him to - night . Yes ! he came very seldom , even for the dull cold purpose of lessons . Mr. Hale was disappointed in his pupil ’s lukewarmness about Greek literature , which had but a short time ago so great an interest for him . And now it often happened that a hurried note from Mr. Thornton would arrive , just at the last moment , saying that he was so much engaged that he could not come to read with Mr. Hale that evening . And though other pupils had taken more than his place as to time , no one was like his first scholar in Mr. Hale ’s heart . He was depressed and sad at this partial cessation of an intercourse which had become dear to him ; and he used to sit pondering over the reason that could have occasioned this change . He startled Margaret , one evening as she sate at her work , by suddenly asking : “
173475	173535	173462	173462	you	123	” He almost blushed as he put this question ; but Mr. Bell ’s scouted idea recurred to him , and the words were out of his mouth before he well knew what he was about . Margaret did not answer immediately ; but by the bent drooping of her head , he guessed what her reply would be . “
173551	173566	173545	173545	I	0	” And she dropped her work , and hid her face in her hands . “
173607	173623	173600	173600	he	4184	” No answer at first ; but by - and - by a little gentle reluctant “
173626	173627	173600	173600	he	4184	” “
173633	173647	173629	173629	you	5155	” A long sigh : a more helpless , nerveless attitude , and another “
173650	173680	173629	173629	you	5155	” But before her father could speak , Margaret lifted up her face , rosy with some beautiful shame , and , fixing her eyes upon him , said : “
173762	173778	173757	173757	I	0	” She sate down on the ground , and laid her head on his knees . “
173804	173805	173795	173795	he	178	” “
173816	173817	173822	173822	he	178	” “
173891	173977	173886	173886	I	0	” They were very quiet and still for some minutes . But , on stroking her cheek in a caressing way soon after , he was almost shocked to find her face wet with tears . As he touched her , she sprang up , and smiling with forced brightness , began to talk of the Lennoxes with such a vehement desire to turn the conversation , that Mr. Hale was too tender - hearted to try to force it back into the old channel . “
174046	174047	174048	174048	I	0	” “
174054	174070	174048	174048	I	0	” said her father , anxious to indulge her in this fresh subject of interest , “
174133	174134	174139	174139	you	528	” “
174156	174165	174166	174166	I	0	” Then after a pause , she added : “
174206	174210	174188	174188	himself	135	” said she , “
174280	176070	174273	174273	I	0	” But the idea of a change took root and germinated in Margaret ’s heart , although not in the way in which her father proposed it at first . She began to consider how desirable something of the kind would be to her father , whose spirits , always feeble , now became too frequently depressed , and whose health , though he never complained , had been seriously affected by his wife ’s illness and death . There were the regular hours of reading with his pupils , but that all giving and no receiving could no longer be called companionship , as in the old days when Mr. Thornton came to study under him . Margaret was conscious of the want under which he was suffering , unknown to himself ; the want of a man ’s intercourse with men . At Helstone there had been perpetual occasion for an interchange of visits with neighbouring clergymen ; and the poor labourers in the fields , or leisurely tramping home at eve , or tending their cattle in the forest , were always at liberty to speak or be spoken to . But in Milton every one was too busy for quiet speech , or any ripened intercourse of thought ; what they said was about business , very present and actual ; and when the tension of mind relating to their daily affairs was over , they sunk into fallow rest until next morning . The workman was not to be found after the day ’s work was done ; he had gone away to some lecture , or some club , or some beershop , according to his degree of character . Mr. Hale thought of trying to deliver a course of lectures at some of the institutions , but he contemplated doing this so much as an effort of duty , and with so little of the genial impulse of love towards his work and its end , that Margaret was sure that it would not be well done until he could look upon it with some kind of zest . CHAPTER XLI . THE JOURNEY ’S END . I see my way as birds their trackless way — I shall arrive ! what time , what circuit first , I ask not : but unless God sends his hail Or blinding fire - balls , sleet , or stifling snow , In some time — his good time — I shall arrive ; He guides me and the bird . In His good time ! BROWNING ’S PARACELSUS . So the winter was getting on , and the days were beginning to lengthen , without bringing with them any of the brightness of hope which usually accompanies the rays of a February sun . Mrs. Thornton had of course entirely ceased to come to the house . Mr. Thornton came occasionally , but his visits were addressed to her father , and were confined to the study . Mr. Hale spoke of him as always the same ; indeed , the very rarity of their intercourse seemed to make Mr. Hale set only the higher value on it . And from what Margaret could gather of what Mr. Thornton had said , there was nothing in the cessation of his visits which could arise from any umbrage or vexation . His business affairs had become complicated during the strike , and required closer attention than he had given to them last winter . Nay , Margaret could even discover that he spoke from time to time of her , and always , as far as she could learn , in the same calm friendly way , never avoiding and never seeking any mention of her name . She was not in spirits to raise her father ’s tone of mind . The dreary peacefulness of the present time had been preceded by so long a period of anxiety and care — even intermixed with storms — that her mind had lost its elasticity . She tried to find herself occupation in teaching the two younger Boucher children , and worked hard at goodness ; hard , I say most truly , for her heart seemed dead to the end of all her efforts ; and though she made them punctually and painfully , yet she stood as far off as ever from any cheerfulness ; her life seemed still bleak and dreary . The only thing she did well , was what she did out of unconscious piety , the silent comforting and consoling of her father . Not a mood of his but what found a ready sympathiser in Margaret ; not a wish of his that she did not strive to forecast , and to fulfil . They were quiet wishes to be sure , and hardly named without hesitation and apology . All the more complete and beautiful was her meek spirit of obedience . March brought the news of Frederick ’s marriage . He and Dolores wrote ; she in Spanish - English , as was but natural , and he with little turns and inversions of words which proved how far the idioms of his bride ’s country were infecting him . On the receipt of Henry Lennox ’s letter , announcing how little hope there was of his ever clearing himself at a court - martial , in the absence of the missing witnesses , Frederick had written to Margaret a pretty vehement letter , containing his renunciation of England as his country ; he wished he could unnative himself , and declared that he would not take his pardon if it were offered him , nor live in the country if he had permission to do so . All of which made Margaret cry sorely , so unnatural did it seem to her at the first opening ; but on consideration , she saw rather in such expression the poignancy of the disappointment which had thus crushed his hopes ; and she felt that there was nothing for it but patience . In the next letter Frederick spoke so joyfully of the future that he had no thought for the past ; and Margaret found a use in herself for the patience she had been craving for him . She would have to be patient . But the pretty , timid , girlish letters of Dolores were beginning to have a charm for both Margaret and her father . The young Spaniard was so evidently anxious to make a favourable impression upon her lover ’s English relations , that her feminine care peeped out at every erasure ; and the letters announcing the marriage , were accompanied by a splendid black lace mantilla , chosen by Dolores herself for her unseen sister - in - law , whom Frederick had represented as a paragon of beauty , wisdom and virtue . Frederick ’s worldly position was raised by this marriage on to as high a level as they could desire . Barbour and Co. was one of the most extensive Spanish houses , and into it he was received as a junior partner . Margaret smiled a little and then sighed as she remembered afresh her old tirades against trade . Here was her preux chevalier of a brother turned merchant , trader ! But then she rebelled against herself , and protested silently against the confusion implied between a Spanish merchant and a Milton millowner . Well , trade or no trade , Frederick was very , very happy . Dolores must be charming , and the mantilla was exquisite ! And then she returned to the present life . Her father had occasionally experienced a difficulty in breathing this spring , which had for the time distressed him exceedingly . Margaret was less alarmed , as this difficulty went off completely in the intervals ; but she still was so desirous of his shaking off the liability altogether , as to make her very urgent that he should accept Mr. Bell ’s invitation to visit him at Oxford this April . Mr. Bell ’s invitation included Margaret . Nay more , he wrote a special letter commanding her to come ; but she felt as if it would be a greater relief to her to remain quietly at home , entirely free from any responsibility whatever , and so to rest her mind and heart in a manner which she had not been able to do for more than two years past . When her father had driven off on his way to the railroad , Margaret felt how great and long had been the pressure on her time and her spirits . It was astonishing , almost stunning , to feel herself so much at liberty ; no one depending on her for cheering care , if not for positive happiness ; no invalid to plan and think for ; she might be idle , and silent and forgetful,—and what seemed worth more than all the other privileges — she might be unhappy if she liked . For months past , all her own personal cares and troubles had had to be stuffed away into a dark cupboard ; but now she had leisure to take them out , and mourn over them , and study their nature , and seek the true method of subduing them into the elements of peace . All these weeks she had been conscious of their existence in a dull kind of way , though they were hidden out of sight . Now , once for all she would consider them and appoint to each of them its right work in her life . So she sat almost motionless for hours in the drawing - room , going over the bitterness of every remembrance with an unwincing resolution . Only once she cried aloud , at the stinging thought of the faithlessness which gave birth to that abasing falsehood . She now would not even acknowledge the force of the temptation ; her plans for Frederick had all failed , and the temptation lay there a dead mockery,—a mockery which had never had life in it ; the lie had been so despicably foolish , seen by the light of the ensuing events , and faith in the power of truth so infinitely the greater wisdom ! In her nervous agitation , she unconsciously opened a book of her father ’s that lay upon the table,—the words that caught her eye in it , seemed almost made for her present state of acute self - abasement : — “
176185	176186	176219	176219	God	174	” “
176194	176198	176219	176219	God	174	” thought Margaret , “
176229	176461	176212	176212	We	4201	” So she rose up , and determined at once to set to on some work which should take her out of herself . To begin with , she called in Martha , as she passed the drawing - room door in going up - stairs , and tried to find out what was below the grave , respectful , servant - like manner , which crusted over her individual character with an obedience which was almost mechanical . She found it difficult to induce Martha to speak of any of her personal interests ; but at last she touched the right chord , in naming Mrs. Thornton . Martha ’s whole face brightened , and , on a little encouragement , out came a long story , of how her father had been in early life connected with Mrs. Thornton ’s husband — nay , had even been in a position to show him some kindness ; what , Martha hardly knew , for it had happened when she was quite a little child ; and circumstances had intervened to separate the two families until Martha was nearly grown up , when , her father having sunk lower and lower from his original occupation as clerk in a warehouse , and her mother being dead , she and her sister , to use Martha ’s own expression , would have been “
176463	176484	176485	176485	I	0	” but for Mrs. Thornton ; who sought them out , and thought for them , and cared for them . “
176577	176578	176579	176580	Miss Fanny	218	” “
176586	176590	176579	176580	Miss Fanny	218	” exclaimed Margaret . “
176641	176838	176851	176851	he	6058	” At this piece of information , Margaret was silent long enough for Martha to recover her propriety , and , with it , her habitual shortness of answer . She swept up the hearth , asked at what time she should prepare tea , and quitted the room with the same wooden face with which she had entered it . Margaret had to pull herself up from indulging a bad trick , which she had lately fallen into , of trying to imagine how every event that she heard of in relation to Mr. Thornton would affect him : whether he would like it or dislike it . The next day she had the little Boucher children for their lessons , and took a long walk , and ended by a visit to Mary Higgins . Somewhat to Margaret ’s surprise , she found Nicholas already come home from his work ; the lengthening light had deceived her as to the lateness of the evening . He too seemed , by his manners , to have entered a little more on the way of humility ; he was quieter , and less self - asserting . “
176853	176857	176851	176851	he	6058	” said he . “
176939	176940	176924	176924	him	4214	” “
176955	176960	176945	176945	you	0	” asked Margaret innocently . “
176971	176977	176961	176961	Thou	4218	” said he , contemptuously . “
177116	177620	177099	177101	One to stop	4224	” The little fellow repeated a Methodist hymn , far above his comprehension in point of language , but of which the swinging rhythm had caught his ear , and which he repeated with all the developed cadence of a member of parliament . When Margaret had duly applauded , Nicholas called for another , and yet another , much to her surprise , as she found him thus oddly and unconsciously led to take an interest in the sacred things which he had formerly scouted . It was past the usual tea - time when she reached home ; but she had the comfort of feeling that no one had been kept waiting for her ; and of thinking her own thoughts while she rested , instead of anxiously watching another person to learn whether to be grave or gay . After tea she resolved to examine a large packet of letters , and pick out those that were to be destroyed . Among them she came to four or five of Mr. Henry Lennox ’s , relating to Frederick ’s affairs ; and she carefully read them over again , with the sole intention , when she began , to ascertain exactly on how fine a chance the justification of her brother hung . But when she had finished the last , and weighed the pros and cons , the little personal revelation of character contained in them forced itself on her notice . It was evident enough , from the stiffness of the wording , that Mr. Lennox had never forgotten his relation to her in any interest he might feel in the subject of the correspondence . They were clever letters ; Margaret saw that in a twinkling ; but she missed out of them all hearty and genial atmosphere . They were to be preserved , however , as valuable ; so she laid them carefully on one side . When this little piece of business was ended , she fell into a reverie ; and the thought of her absent father ran strangely in Margaret ’s head that night . She almost blamed herself for having felt her solitude ( and consequently his absence ) as a relief ; but these two days had set her up afresh , with new strength and brighter hope . Plans which had lately appeared to her in the guise of tasks , now appeared like pleasures . The morbid scales had fallen from her eyes , and she saw her position and her work more truly . If only Mr. Thornton would restore her the lost friendship,—nay , if he would only come from time to time to cheer her father as in former days,—though she should never see him , she felt as if the course of her future life , though not brilliant in prospect , might lie clear and even before her . She sighed as she rose up to go to bed . In spite of the “
177626	177880	177881	177881	I	0	me,”—in spite of the one plain duty of devotion to her father,—there lay at her heart an anxiety and a pang of sorrow . And Mr. Hale thought of Margaret , that April evening , just as strangely and as persistently as she was thinking of him . He had been fatigued by going about among his old friends and old familiar places . He had had exaggerated ideas of the change which his altered opinions might make in his friends ’ reception of him ; but although some of them might have felt shocked or grieved , or indignant at his falling off in the abstract , as soon as they saw the face of the man whom they had once loved , they forgot his opinions in himself ; or only remembered them enough to give an additional tender gravity to their manner . For Mr. Hale had not been known to many ; he had belonged to one of the smaller colleges , and had always been shy and reserved ; but those who in youth had cared to penetrate to the delicacy of thought and feeling that lay below his silence and indecision , took him to their hearts , with something of the protecting kindness which they would have shown to a woman . And the renewal of this kindliness , after the lapse of years , and an interval of so much change , overpowered him more than any roughness or expression of disapproval could have done . “
177890	177895	177881	177881	I	0	” said Mr. Bell . “
177910	177911	177912	177912	I	0	” “
177916	177921	177912	177912	I	0	” said Mr. Hale . “
177951	177952	177929	177929	I	0	” “
177995	178002	177988	177988	you	4226	” Mr. Hale shook his head . “
178008	178048	178049	178049	Bell	178	” said he . But after a minute ’s pause , he raised himself from his half recumbent position , in one of Mr. Bell ’s luxurious easy - chairs , and said with a kind of trembling earnestness : “
178206	178230	178195	178195	God	174	” he added , falling back into his old position . Mr. Bell blew his nose ostentatiously before answering . Then he said : “
178341	178358	178360	178360	Margaret	123	” There was a pause . Mr. Hale spoke first , in continuation of his thought : “
178362	178363	178360	178360	Margaret	123	” “
178372	178373	178367	178367	Margaret	123	” “
178379	178380	178367	178367	Margaret	123	” “
178383	178384	178367	178367	Margaret	123	” “
178435	178436	178428	178428	she	123	” “
178450	178451	178452	178452	He	4246	” “
178489	178490	178485	178485	she	131	” “
178783	178935	178936	178937	A coroner	7227	” If Mr. Bell had had a prophetic eye he might have seen the torch all but inverted , and the angel with the grave and composed face standing very nigh , beckoning to his friend . That night Mr. Hale laid his head down upon the pillow on which it never more should stir with life . The servant who entered his room in the morning , received no answer to his speech ; drew near the bed , and saw the calm , beautiful face lying white and cold under the ineffaceable seal of death . The attitude was exquisitely easy ; there had been no pain — no struggle . The action of the heart must have ceased as he lay down . Mr. Bell was stunned by the shock ; and only recovered when the time came for being angry at every suggestion of his man ’s . “
179029	179208	179019	179019	I	0	” The bag was packed , the cab ordered , the railway reached , in twenty minutes from the time of this decision . The London train whizzed by , drew back some yards , and in Mr. Bell was hurried by the impatient guard . He threw himself back in his seat , to try , with closed eyes , to understand how one in life yesterday could be dead to - day ; and shortly tears stole out between his grizzled eye - lashes , at the feeling of which he opened his keen eyes , and looked as severely cheerful as his set determination could make him . He was not going to blubber before a set of strangers . Not he ! There was no set of strangers , only one sitting far from him on the same side . By - and - by Mr. Bell peered at him , to discover what manner of man it was that might have been observing his emotion ; and behind the great sheet of the outspread “
179211	179217	179019	179019	I	0	” he recognized Mr. Thornton . “
179226	179278	179279	179279	I	0	” said he , removing hastily to a closer proximity . He shook Mr. Thornton vehemently by the hand , until the gripe ended in a sudden relaxation , for the hand was wanted to wipe away tears . He had last seen Mr. Thornton in his friend Hale ’s company . “
179305	179306	179295	179295	Hale	134	” “
179313	179314	179309	179310	Mr. Hale	134	” “

179413	179432	179434	179434	she	4265	” Not one word was spoken for above a quarter of an hour . Then Mr. Thornton said : “
179436	179442	179434	179434	she	4265	” and stopped full short . “
179517	179537	179511	179511	I	0	” Mr. Thornton made one or two fruitless attempts to speak , before he could get out the words : “
179544	179545	179546	179546	I	0	” “
179610	179611	179614	179614	they	4273	” “
179616	179624	179614	179614	they	4273	” asked Mr. Thornton with trembling interest . “
179712	179713	179709	179710	that brother	4280	” “
179724	179725	179730	179732	a clever Lennox	4284	” “

179805	179823	179826	179826	she	123	” asked Mr. Thornton , too earnestly curious to be aware of the impertinence of his question . “
179884	179969	179881	179882	her aunt	446	” Neither Mr. Bell nor Mr. Thornton was in a laughing humour ; so the oddity of any of the speeches which the former made was unnoticed by them . Mr. Bell whistled , without emitting any sound beyond a long hissing breath ; changed his seat , without finding comfort or rest ; while Mr. Thornton sat immovably still , his eyes fixed on one spot in the newspaper , which he had taken up in order to give himself leisure to think . “
179975	179983	179881	179882	her aunt	446	” asked Mr. Bell , at length . “
180002	180003	179881	179882	her aunt	446	” “
180063	180064	180055	180055	you	0	” “
180067	180073	180055	180055	you	0	” ( Very shortly . ) “

180132	180242	180257	180257	You	0	” He took up his newspaper with a determined air , as if resolved to avoid further conversation ; and Mr. Bell was fain to resort to his former occupation of trying to find out how he could best break the news to Margaret . She was at an upstairs window ; she saw him alight ; she guessed the truth with an instinctive flash . She stood in the middle of the drawing - room , as if arrested in her first impulse to rush downstairs , and as if by the same restraining thought she had been turned to stone ; so white and immovable was she . “
180280	180288	180278	180278	papa	528	” CHAPTER XLII . ALONE ! ALONE ! “
180342	180654	180655	180655	I	0	” MRS . BROWNING . The shock had been great . Margaret fell into a state of prostration , which did not show itself in sobs and tears , or even find the relief of words . She lay on the sofa with her eyes shut , never speaking but when spoken to , and then replying in whispers . Mr. Bell was perplexed . He dared not leave her ; he dared not ask her to accompany him back to Oxford , which had been one of the plans he had formed on the journey to Milton , her physical exhaustion was evidently too complete for her to undertake any such fatigue — putting the sight that she would have to encounter out of the question . Mr. Bell sate over the fire , considering what he had better do . Margaret lay motionless , and almost breathless by him . He would not leave her , even for the dinner which Dixon had prepared for him downstairs , and , with sobbing hospitality , would fain have tempted him to eat . He had a plateful of something brought up to him . In general , he was particular and dainty enough , and knew well each shade of flavour in his food , but now the devilled chicken tasted like sawdust . He minced up some of the fowl for Margaret , and peppered and salted it well ; but when Dixon , following his directions , tried to feed her , the languid shake of head , proved that in such a state as Margaret was in , food would only choke , not nourish her . Mr. Bell gave a great sigh ; lifted up his stout old limbs ( stiff with travelling ) from their easy position , and followed Dixon out of the room . “
180728	180773	180705	180706	The girl	5516	” Dixon was crying — enough for two ; but , after wiping her eyes and steadying her voice , she managed to tell Mr. Bell , that Mrs. Lennox was too near her confinement to be able to undertake any journey at present . “
180795	180796	180793	180793	she	4296	” “
180824	180851	180816	180817	Mrs. Lennox	387	” said Dixon , who did not much approve of a stranger entering the household , to share with her in her ruling care of Margaret . “
180855	180869	180870	180870	She	4296	” Mr. Bell restricted himself by coughing over the end of his sentence . “
180994	181141	180987	180987	I	0	” Accordingly Mr. Bell wrote a letter , which Mrs. Shaw declared , with many tears , to be so like one of the dear general ’s when he was going to have a fit of the gout , that she should always value and preserve it . If he had given her the option , by requesting or urging her , as if a refusal were possible , she might not have come — true and sincere as was her sympathy with Margaret . It needed the sharp uncourteous command to make her conquer her vis inertiæ and allow herself to be packed by her maid , after the latter had completed the boxes . Edith , all cap , shawl , and tears , came out to the top of the stairs , as Captain Lennox was taking her mother down to the carriage : “
181209	181242	181202	181202	you	5139	” Edith re - entered the drawing - room . Mr. Henry Lennox was there , cutting open the pages of a new Review . Without lifting his head , he said , “
181277	181278	181261	181261	you	5139	” “
181284	181288	181261	181261	you	5139	” said Edith , “
181350	181351	181353	181353	we	4315	” “
181355	181373	181353	181353	we	4315	” asked he indifferently , with an appearance of being interested in a passage in the Review . “
181471	181512	181445	181445	I	0	” In the same spirit of kindness , Mrs. Shaw journeyed to Milton , occasionally dreading the first meeting , and wondering how it would be got over ; but more frequently planning how soon she could get Margaret away from “
181517	181528	181445	181445	I	0	” and back in the pleasant comforts of Harley Street . “
181532	181539	181445	181445	I	0	” she said to her maid ; “
181580	182010	181569	181569	I	0	” And to herself she acknowledged , that she had always thought her brother - in - law rather a weak man , but never so weak as now , when she saw for what a place he had exchanged the lovely Helstone home . Margaret had remained in the same state ; white , motionless , speechless , tearless . They had told her that her aunt Shaw was coming ; but she had not expressed either surprise or pleasure , or dislike to the idea . Mr. Bell , whose appetite had returned , and who appreciated Dixon ’s endeavours to gratify it , in vain urged upon her to taste some sweetbreads stewed with oysters ; she shook her head with the same quiet obstinacy as on the previous day ; and he was obliged to console himself for her rejection , by eating them all himself . But Margaret was the first to hear the stopping of the cab that brought her aunt from the railway station . Her eyelids quivered , her lips coloured and trembled . Mr. Bell went down to meet Mrs. Shaw ; and when they came up , Margaret was standing , trying to steady her dizzy self ; and when she saw her aunt , she went forward to the arms open to receive her , and first found the passionate relief of tears on her aunt ’s shoulder . All thoughts of quiet habitual love , of tenderness for years , of relationship to the dead , all that inexplicable likeness in look , tone , and gesture , that seem to belong to one family , and which reminded Margaret so forcibly at this moment of her mother , came in to melt and soften her numbed heart into the overflow of warm tears . Mr. Bell stole out of the room , and went down into the study , where he ordered a fire , and tried to divert his thoughts by taking down and examining the different books . Each volume brought a remembrance or a suggestion of his dead friend . It might be a change of employment from his two days ’ work of watching Margaret , but it was no change of thought . He was glad to catch the sound of Mr. Thornton ’s voice , making enquiry at the door . Dixon was rather cavalierly dismissing him ; for with the appearance of Mrs. Shaw ’s maid , came visions of former grandeur , of the Beresford blood , of the “
182012	182169	182170	182170	Thornton	179	” ( so she was pleased to term it ) from which her young lady had been ousted , and to which she was now , please God , to be restored . These visions , which she had been dwelling on with complacency in her conversation with Mrs. Shaw ’s maid ( skilfully eliciting meanwhile all the circumstances of state and consequence connected with the Harley Street establishment , for the edification of the listening Martha ) , made Dixon rather inclined to be supercilious in her treatment of any inhabitant of Milton ; so , though she always stood rather in awe of Mr. Thornton , she was as curt as she durst be in telling him that he could see none of the inmates of the house that night . It was rather uncomfortable to be contradicted in her statement by Mr. Bell ’s opening the study - door , and calling out : “
182191	182235	182184	182184	I	0	” So Mr. Thornton went into the study , and Dixon had to retreat into the kitchen , and reinstate herself in her own esteem by a prodigious story of Sir John Beresford ’s coach and six , when he was high sheriff . “
182284	182285	182271	182271	Margaret	123	” “
182292	182297	182288	182289	her aunt	446	” asked Mr. Thornton . “
182337	182338	182339	182339	You	179	” “
182359	182360	182347	182347	We	4330	” “
182364	182365	182347	182347	We	4330	” “
182376	182377	182347	182347	We	4330	” “
182408	182466	182467	182467	I	0	” Mr. Bell was some time upstairs . Mr. Thornton began to think it long , for he was full of business , and had hardly been able to spare the time for running up to Crampton , and enquiring how Miss Hale was . When they had set out upon their walk , Mr. Bell said : “
182622	182649	182619	182619	my	0	” He paused , as if asking a question ; but he received no answer from his companion , the echo of whose thoughts kept repeating — “
182657	183262	182619	182619	my	0	” Alas ! and that was the way in which this eighteen months in Milton — to him so unspeakably precious , down to its very bitterness , which was worth all the rest of life ’s sweetness — would be remembered . Neither loss of father , nor loss of mother , dear as she was to Mr. Thornton , could have poisoned the remembrance of the weeks , the days , the hours , when a walk of two miles , every step of which was pleasant , as it brought him nearer and nearer to her , took him to her sweet presence — every step of which was rich , as each recurring moment that bore him away from her made him recall some fresh grace in her demeanour , or pleasant pungency in her character . Yes ! whatever had happened to him , external to his relation to her , he could never have spoken of that time , when he could have seen her every day — when he had her within his grasp , as it were — as a time of suffering . It had been a royal time of luxury to him , with all its stings and contumelies , compared to the poverty that crept round and clipped the anticipation of the future down to sordid fact , and life without an atmosphere of either hope or fear . Mrs. Thornton and Fanny were in the dining - room ; the latter in a flutter of small exultation , as the maid held up one glossy material after another , to try the effect of the wedding - dresses by candle - light . Her mother really tried to sympathise with her , but could not . Neither taste nor dress were in her line of subjects , and she heartily wished that Fanny had accepted her brother ’s offer of having the wedding clothes provided by some first - rate London dressmaker , without the endless troublesome discussions , and unsettled waverings , that arose out of Fanny ’s desire to choose and superintend everything herself . Mr. Thornton was only too glad to mark his grateful approbation of any sensible man , who could be captivated by Fanny ’s second - rate airs and graces , by giving her ample means for providing herself with the finery , which certainly rivalled , if it did not exceed , the lover in her estimation . When her brother and Mr. Bell came in , Fanny blushed and simpered , and fluttered over the signs of her employment , in a way which could not have failed to draw attention from any one else but Mr. Bell . If he thought about her and her silks and satins at all , it was to compare her and them with the pale sorrow he had left behind him , sitting motionless , with bent head and folded hands , in a room where the stillness was so great that you might almost fancy the rush in your straining ears was occasioned by the spirits of the dead , yet hovering round their beloved . For when Mr. Bell had first gone upstairs , Mrs. Shaw lay asleep on the sofa ; and no sound broke the silence . Mrs. Thornton gave Mr. Bell her formal , hospitable welcome . She was never so gracious as when receiving her son ’s friends in her son ’s house ; and the more unexpected they were , the more honour to her admirable housekeeping preparations for comfort . “
183268	183272	183265	183266	Miss Hale	187	” she asked . “
183286	183287	183265	183266	Miss Hale	187	” “
183306	183307	183308	183308	I	0	” “
183387	183388	183389	183389	She	187	” “
183395	183410	183389	183389	She	187	” said Mrs. Thornton , with an implied meaning which her son understood well . “
183414	183419	183389	183389	She	187	” continued Mrs. Thornton , “
183447	183476	183477	183477	They	6995	” But she did not feel interest enough in the answer to her question to wait for it . She left the room to make her household arrangements . “
183567	183568	183563	183563	Frederick	159	” “
183571	183576	183569	183569	Frederick	159	” exclaimed Mr. Thornton . “
183586	183595	183596	183596	Frederick	159	” He stopped short in his vehement question . “
183598	183605	183596	183596	Frederick	159	” said Mr. Bell in surprise . “
183624	183625	183619	183619	you	4353	” “
183641	183642	183639	183639	he	159	” “

183911	183916	183901	183903	a young man	5208	” replied Mr. Thornton , “

183975	184008	183972	183972	you	0	” said Mr. Bell , wheeling round , and shutting one eye , the better to bring the forces of the other to bear with keen scrutiny on Mr. Thornton ’s face , “
184021	184030	184013	184013	you	0	” No answer . No change of countenance . “
184052	184053	184044	184044	I	0	” “
184071	184086	184065	184065	She	187	” said Mr. Thornton , driven to bay by Mr. Bell ’s pertinacious questioning . “
184200	184210	184211	184212	Mr. Bell	178	” Mr. Thornton ’s eyes glowed like red embers . “
184214	184218	184211	184212	Mr. Bell	178	” said he , “
184250	184371	184244	184244	us	4378	” For though his heart leaped up , as at a trumpet - call , to every word that Mr. Bell had said , and though he knew that what he had said would henceforward bind the thought of the old Oxford Fellow closely up with the most precious things of his heart , yet he would not be forced into any expression of what he felt towards Margaret . He was no mocking - bird of praise to try , because another extolled what he reverenced and passionately loved , to outdo him in laudation . So he turned to some of the dry matters of business that lay between Mr. Bell and him , as landlord and tenant . “

185623	185632	185938	185938	MARGARET:—I	390	” CHAPTER XLIII . MARGARET ’S FLITTIN ’ . “
185650	185935	185936	185937	MY DEAR	5418	” ELLIOTT . Mrs. Shaw took as vehement a dislike as it was possible for one of her gentle nature to do , against Milton . It was noisy , and smoky , and the poor people whom she saw in the streets were dirty , and the rich ladies over - dressed , and not a man that she saw , high or low , had his clothes made to fit him . She was sure Margaret would never regain her lost strength while she stayed in Milton ; and she herself was afraid of one of her old attacks of the nerves . Margaret must return with her , and that quickly . This , if not the exact force of her words , was at any rate the spirit of what she urged on Margaret , till the latter , weak , weary , and broken - spirited , yielded a reluctant promise that , as soon as Wednesday was over , she would prepare to accompany her aunt back to town , leaving Dixon in charge of all the arrangements for paying bills , disposing of furniture , and shutting up the house . Before that Wednesday — that mournful Wednesday , when Mr. Hale was to be interred , far away from either of the homes he had known in life , and far away from the wife who lay lonely among strangers ( and this last was Margaret ’s great trouble , for she thought that if she had not given way to that overwhelming stupor during the first sad days , she could have arranged things otherwise)—before that Wednesday , Margaret received a letter from Mr. Bell . “
186602	186614	186615	186616	Margaret Hale	123	” Margaret took up a pen and scrawled with trembling hand , “
186626	186700	186619	186620	the girl	5516	” In her weak state she could not think of any other words , and yet , she was vexed to use these . But she was so much fatigued even by this slight exertion , that if she could have thought of another form of acceptance , she could not have sate up to write a syllable of it . She was obliged to lie down again and try not to think . “
186713	186714	186619	186620	the girl	5516	” “
186717	186722	186619	186620	the girl	5516	” said Margaret feebly . “
186734	186735	186736	186736	I	0	” “
186771	186772	186766	186766	I	0	” “
186787	186788	186779	186779	I	0	” “

186860	187054	186853	186853	I	0	” and Margaret closed her eyes by way of stopping the conversation . The house teemed with comfort now , compared to what it had been . The evenings were chilly , and by Mrs. Shaw ’s directions fires were lighted in every bedroom . She petted Margaret in every possible way , and bought every delicacy , or soft luxury in which she herself would have burrowed and sought comfort . But Margaret was indifferent to all these things ; or , if they forced themselves upon her attention , it was simply as causes for gratitude to her aunt , who was putting herself so much out of the way to think of her . She was restless , though so weak . All the day long , she kept herself from thinking of the ceremony which was going on at Oxford , by wandering from room to room , and languidly setting aside such articles as she wished to retain . Dixon followed her by Mrs. Shaw ’s desire , ostensibly to receive instructions , but with a private injunction to soothe her into repose as soon as might be . “
187123	187139	187115	187115	I	0	” And she sate down hastily , as if afraid of thinking , and wrote : “
187164	187171	187172	187172	She	186	“ Yours sincerely , MARGARET HALE . ”
187233	187261	187228	187229	Mrs. Shaw	126	“ she doubted whether Miss Hale heard a word of what she said , though she talked the whole time , in order to divert her intention . ”
187326	187363	187322	187323	Mrs. Shaw	126	“ I am sure , my dear , you can have no friends here with whom you are sufficiently intimate to justify you in calling upon them so soon ; before you have been at church . ”
187364	187396	187322	187323	Mrs. Shaw	126	“ But to - day is my only day ; if Captain Lennox comes this afternoon , and if we must — if I must really go to - morrow — — ”
187397	187486	187322	187323	Mrs. Shaw	126	“ Oh , yes , we shall go to - morrow . I am more and more convinced that this air is bad for you , and makes you look so pale and ill ; besides , Edith expects us ; and she may be waiting for me ; and you can not be left alone , my dear , at your age . No ; if you must make these calls , I will go with you . Dixon can get us a coach , I suppose ? ”
187876	187891	187862	187862	she	123	“ I should like to have some little thing to remind me of Bessy . ”
187941	187953	187938	187938	Mary	178	“ Oh , take summat better ; that only cost fourpence ! ”
187954	187962	187964	187964	Margaret	123	“ That will do , thank you , ”
187991	187998	188000	188000	she	123	“ Now to Mrs. Thornton ’s , ”
188004	188010	188000	188000	she	123	“ It must be done . ”
188092	188098	188099	188099	she	126	“ What an icy room ! ”
188211	188289	188290	188291	Mrs. Shaw	126	“ Allow me to introduce my aunt , Mrs. Shaw . I am going away from Milton to - morrow ; I do not know if you are aware of it , but I wanted to see you once again , Mrs. Thornton , to — to apologize for my manner the last time I saw you ; and to say that I am sure you meant kindly — however much we may have misunderstood each other . ”
188318	188371	188314	188315	Mrs. Thornton	216	“ Miss Hale , I am glad you do me justice . I did no more than I believed to be my duty in remonstrating with you as I did . I have always desired to act the part of a friend to you . I am glad you do me justice . ”
188372	188375	188377	188377	Margaret	123	“ And , ”
188385	188422	188377	188377	Margaret	123	“ will you do me justice , and believe that though I cannot — I do not choose — to give explanations of my conduct , I have not acted in the unbecoming way you apprehended ? ”
188457	188504	188506	188507	Mrs. Thornton	216	“ Yes , I do believe you . Let us say no more about it . Where are you going to reside , Miss Hale ? I understood from Mr. Bell that you were going to leave Milton . You never liked Milton , you know , ”
188516	188539	188506	188507	Mrs. Thornton	216	“ but for all that , you must not expect me to congratulate you on quitting it . Where shall you live ? ”
188540	188545	188547	188547	Margaret	123	“ With my aunt , ”
188554	188574	188576	188577	Mrs. Shaw	126	“ My niece will reside with me in Harley Street . She is almost like a daughter to me , ”
188584	188647	188576	188577	Mrs. Shaw	126	“ and I am glad to acknowledge my own obligation for any kindness that has been shown to her . If you and your husband ever come to the town , my son and daughter , Captain and Mrs. Lennox , will , I am sure , join with me in wishing to do anything in our power to show you attention . ”
188696	188730	188692	188692	she	123	“ My husband is dead . Mr. Thornton is my son . I never go to London ; so I am not likely to be able to avail myself of your polite offers . ”
188761	188764	188766	188767	his mother	5657	“ John , ”
188769	188800	188766	188767	his mother	5657	“ this lady is Mrs. Shaw , Miss Hale ’s aunt . I am sorry to say , that Miss Hale ’s call is to wish us good - bye . ”
188801	188807	188809	188809	he	179	“ You are going then ! ”
188815	188818	188820	188820	Margaret	123	“ Yes , ”
188822	188829	188820	188820	Margaret	123	“ We leave to - morrow . ”
188830	188844	188846	188847	Mrs. Shaw	126	“ My son - in - law comes this evening to escort us , ”
189027	189030	189032	189032	he	179	“ No ! ”
189034	189117	189032	189032	he	179	“ I put it to the touch once , and I lost it all . Let her go,—with her stony heart , and her beauty;—how set and terrible her look is now , for all her loveliness of feature ! She is afraid I shall speak what will require some stern repression . Let her go . Beauty and heiress as she may be , she will find it hard to meet with a truer heart than mine . Let her go ! ”
189214	189224	189226	189227	her aunt	446	“ I - told - you - so ’s , ”
189297	189323	189283	189284	the latter	947	“ Oh ! let us go . I can not be patient here . I shall not get well here . I want to forget . ”
189410	189413	189415	189415	he	202	“ Eh ! ”
189422	189576	189415	189415	he	202	“ to think of th ’ oud gentleman dropping off as he did ! Yo ’ might ha ’ knocked me down wi ’ a straw when they telled me . ‘ Mr. Hale ? ’ said I ; ‘ him as was th ’ parson ? ’ ‘ Ay , ’ said they . ‘ Then , ’ said I , ‘ there ’s as good a man gone as ever lived on this earth , let who will be t’other ! ’ And I came to see yo ’ , and tell yo ’ how grieved I were , but them women in th ’ kitchen would n’t tell yo ’ I were there . They said yo ’ were ill,—and butter me , but yo ’ dunnot look like the same wench . And yo’re going to be a grand lady up i ’ Lunnon , are n’t yo ’ ? ”
189577	189583	189585	189585	Margaret	123	“ Not a grand lady , ”
189590	189833	189585	189585	Margaret	123	“ Well ! Thornton said — says he , a day or two ago , ‘ Higgins , have yo ’ seen Miss Hale ? ’ ‘ No , ’ says I ; ‘ there ’s a pack o ’ women who wo n’t let me at her . But I can bide my time , if she ’s ill . She and I knows each other pretty well ; and hoo’l not go doubting that I ’m main sorry for th ’ oud gentleman ’s death , just because I ca n’t get at her and tell her so . ’ And says he , ‘ Yo’ll not have much time for to try and see her , my fine chap . She ’s not for staying with us a day longer nor she can help . She ’s got grand relations , and they ’re carrying her off ; and we sha n’t see her no more . ’ ‘ Measter , ’ said I , ‘ if I dunnot see her afore hoo goes , I ’ll strive to get up to Lunnon next Whitsuntide , that I will . I ’ll not be baulked of saying her good - bye by any relations whatsomdever . But bless yo ’ , I knowed yo’d come . It were only for to humour the measter , I let on as if I thought yo’d m’appen leave Milton without seeing me . ”
189834	189840	189842	189842	Margaret	123	“ You ’re quite right , ”
189844	189944	189842	189842	Margaret	123	“ You only do me justice . And you ’ll not forget me , I ’m sure . If no one else in Milton remembers me , I ’m certain you will ; and papa too . You know how good and tender he was . Look , Higgins ! here is his Bible . I have kept it for you . I can ill spare it ; but I know he would have liked you to have it . I ’m sure you ’ll care for it , and study what is in it , for his sake . ”
189945	190021	189585	189585	Margaret	123	“ Yo ’ may say that . If it were the deuce ’s own scribble , and yo ’ axed me to read in it for yo’r sake and the oud gentleman ’s , I ’d do it . Whatten ’s this , wench ! I ’m not going for to take yo’r brass , so dunnot think it . We ’ve been great friends , ’bout the sound o ’ money passing between us . ”
190022	190032	190034	190034	Margaret	123	“ For the children — for Boucher ’s children , ”
190038	190062	190063	190063	she	123	“ They may need it . You ’ve no right to refuse it for them . I would not give you one penny , ”
190068	190080	190063	190063	she	123	“ do n’t think there ’s any of it for you . ”
190081	190100	189585	189585	Margaret	123	“ Well , wench ! I can nobbut say , Bless yo ’ ! and bless yo’!—and amen . ”
190108	190128	190129	190129	COWPER	393	“ A dull rotation , never at a stay , Yesterday ’s face twin image of to - day . ”
190131	190160	190129	190129	COWPER	393	“ Of what each one should be , he sees the form and rule , And till he reach to that , his joy can ne’er be full . ”
190764	190768	190770	190770	Edith	131	“ Poor child ! ”
190772	190841	190770	190770	Edith	131	“ It is a little sad for you to be left , night after night , just at this time when all the world is so gay . But we shall be having our dinner - parties soon — as soon as Henry comes back from circuit — and then there will be a little pleasant variety for you . No wonder it is moped , poor darling ! ”
190867	190871	190873	190873	she	131	“ so different , ”
190876	190888	190873	190873	she	131	“ from the old dowager dinners under mamma ’s _ régime _ ”
191476	191489	191468	191468	she	123	“ Oh , Mr. Bell ! I never thought of seeing you ! ”
191490	191511	191445	191446	Mr. Bell	178	“ But you give me a welcome , I hope , as well as that very pretty start of surprise . ”
191512	191529	191445	191446	Mr. Bell	178	“ Have you dined ? How did you come ? Let me order you some dinner . ”
191530	191572	191468	191468	she	123	“ If you ’re going to have any . Otherwise , you know , there is no one who cares less for eating than I do . But where are the others ? Gone out to dinner ? Left you alone ? ”
191573	191610	191445	191446	Mr. Bell	178	“ Oh yes ! and it is such a rest . I was just thinking — But will you run the risk of dinner ? I do n’t know if there is anything in the house . ”
191611	191734	191445	191446	Mr. Bell	178	“ Why , to tell you the truth , I dined at my club . Only they do n’t cook as well as they did , so I thought , if you were going to dine , I might try and make out my dinner . But never mind , never mind ! There are n’t ten cooks in England to be trusted at impromptu dinners . If their skill and their fires will stand it , their tempers wo n’t . You shall make me some tea , Margaret . And now , what were you thinking of ? you were going to tell me . Whose letters were those , god - daughter , that you hid away so speedily ? ”
191735	191740	191742	191742	Margaret	123	“ Only Dixon ’s , ”
191748	191767	191742	191742	Margaret	123	“ Whew ! is that all ? Who do you think came up in the train with me ? ”
191768	191774	191776	191776	Margaret	123	“ I do n’t know , ”
191784	191806	191776	191776	Margaret	123	“ Your what d’ye call him ? What ’s the right name for a cousin - in - law ’s brother ? ”
191807	191812	191814	191814	Margaret	123	“ Mr. Henry Lennox ? ”
191816	191819	191821	191822	Mr. Bell	178	“ Yes , ”
191824	191844	191821	191822	Mr. Bell	178	“ You knew him formerly , did n’t you ? What sort of a person is he , Margaret ? ”
191845	191852	191854	191854	Margaret	123	“ I liked him long ago , ”
191876	191911	191864	191864	she	123	“ You know we have been corresponding about Frederick since ; but I have not seen him for nearly three years , and he may be changed . What did you think of him ? ”
191912	191994	191821	191822	Mr. Bell	178	“ I do n’t know . He was so busy trying to find out who I was , in the first instance , and what I was in the second , that he never let out what he was ; unless indeed that veiled curiosity of his as to what manner of man he had to talk to was not a good piece , and a fair indication of his character . Do you call him good - looking , Margaret ? ”
191995	192004	191821	191822	Mr. Bell	178	“ No ! certainly not . Do you ? ”
192005	192022	191864	191864	she	123	“ Not I. But I thought perhaps you might . Is he a great deal here ? ”
192023	192058	191821	191822	Mr. Bell	178	“ I fancy he is when he is in town . He has been on circuit now since I came . But — Mr. Bell — have you come from Oxford or from Milton ? ”
192059	192073	191821	191822	Mr. Bell	178	“ From Milton . Do n’t you see I ’m smoke - dried ? ”
192074	192092	191864	191864	she	123	“ Certainly . But I thought that it might be the effect of the antiquities of Oxford . ”
192093	192202	191821	191822	Mr. Bell	178	“ Come now , be a sensible woman ! In Oxford , I could have managed all the landlords in the place , and had my own way , with half the trouble your Milton landlord has given me , and defeated me after all . He wo n’t take the house off our hands till next June twelve - month . Luckily , Mr. Thornton found a tenant for it . Why do n’t you ask after Mr. Thornton , Margaret ? He has proved himself a very active friend of yours , I can tell you . Taken more than half the trouble off my hands . ”
192203	192214	192216	192216	Margaret	123	“ And how is he ? How is Mrs. Thornton ? ”
192230	192345	192224	192224	she	123	“ I suppose they ’re well . I ’ve been staying at their house till I was driven out of it by the perpetual clack about that Thornton girl ’s marriage . It was too much for Thornton himself , though she was his sister . He used to go and sit in his own room perpetually . He ’s getting past the age for caring for such things , either as principal or accessory . I was surprised to find the old lady falling into the current , and carried away by her daughter ’s enthusiasm for orange - blossoms and lace . I thought Mrs. Thornton had been made of sterner stuff . ”
192346	192362	192364	192364	Margaret	123	“ She would put on any assumption of feeling to veil her daughter ’s weakness , ”
192370	192393	192364	192364	Margaret	123	“ Perhaps so . You ’ve studied her , have you ? She does n’t seem over fond of you , Margaret . ”
192394	192399	192401	192401	Margaret	123	“ I know it , ”
192403	192413	192415	192415	she	123	“ Oh , here is tea , at last ! ”
192637	192657	192615	192615	She	123	“ Mr. Lennox , I have been so much obliged to you for all you have done about Frederick . ”
192658	192669	192671	192671	he	135	“ I am only sorry it has been so unsuccessful , ”
192732	192782	192702	192702	herself	123	“ That Horrocks — that very last witness of all , has proved as unavailing as all the others . Mr. Lennox has discovered that he sailed for Australia only last August ; only two months before Frederick was in England , and gave us the names of — — ”
192783	192794	192796	192797	Mr. Bell	178	“ Frederick in England ! you never told me that ! ”
192801	192834	192836	192836	Margaret	123	“ I thought you knew . I never doubted you had been told . Of course , it was a great secret , and perhaps I should not have named it now , ”
192842	192856	192858	192859	Mr. Lennox	135	“ I have never named it to either my brother or your cousin , ”
192870	192951	192954	192954	himself	135	“ Never mind , Margaret . I am not living in a talking , babbling world , nor yet among people who are trying to worm facts out of me ; you need n’t look so frightened because you have let the cat out of the bag to a faithful old hermit like me . I shall never name his having been in England ; I shall be out of temptation , for no one will ask me . Stay ! ”
192959	192968	192954	192954	himself	135	“ Was it at your mother ’s funeral ? ”
192969	192978	192980	192980	Margaret	123	“ He was with mamma when she died , ”
192984	193029	192980	192980	Margaret	123	“ To be sure ! To be sure ! Why , some one asked me if he had not been over then , and I denied it stoutly — not many weeks ago — who could it have been ? Oh ! I recollect ! ”
193103	193178	193094	193095	Mr. Lennox	135	“ I suppose as Mr. Bell is now acquainted with all the circumstances attending your brother ’s unfortunate dilemma , I can not do better than inform him exactly how the research into the evidence we once hoped to produce in his favour stands at present . So , if he will do me the honour to breakfast with me to - morrow , we will go over the names of these missing gentry . ”
193179	193237	193284	193284	she	123	“ I should like to hear all the particulars , if I may . Can not you come here ? I dare not ask you both to breakfast , though I am sure you would be welcome . But let me know all you can about Frederick , even though there may be no hope at present . ”
193238	193259	193261	193262	Mr. Lennox	135	“ I have an engagement at half - past eleven . But I will certainly come if you wish it , ”
193314	193317	193319	193319	he	135	“ Well ! ”
193321	193365	193319	193319	he	135	“ I do n’t know what Mr. Lennox is inclined to do , but I ’m disposed to be moving off homewards . I ’ve been a journey to - day , and journeys begin to tell upon my sixty and odd years . ”
193366	193379	193381	193382	Mr. Lennox	135	“ I believe I shall stay and see my brother and sister , ”
193433	193443	193445	193445	she	123	“ Do n’t go yet , please Mr. Bell , ”
193449	193467	193469	193469	she	123	“ I want you to see Edith ; and I want Edith to know you . Please ! ”
193512	193523	193525	193525	he	135	“ You see how she overpowers me , Mr. Lennox , ”
193527	193601	193602	193602	He	135	“ And I hope you noticed the happy choice of her expressions ; she wants me to ‘ see ’ this cousin Edith , who , I am told , is a great beauty ; but she has the honesty to change her word when she comes to me — Mrs. Lennox is to ‘ know ’ me . I suppose I am not much to ‘ see , ’ eh , Margaret ? ”
193808	193822	193824	193824	Edith	131	“ What a shame that we were not at home to receive you , ”
193826	193860	193824	193824	Edith	131	“ You , too , Henry ! though I do n’t know that we should have stayed at home for you . And for Mr. Bell ! for Margaret ’s Mr. Bell — — ”
193861	193874	193876	193881	her brother - in - law	7942	“ There is no knowing what sacrifices you would not have made , ”
193883	193900	193876	193881	her brother - in - law	7942	“ Even a dinner - party ! and the delight of wearing this very becoming dress . ”
193934	194001	193930	193930	he	135	“ Will you show your readiness to make sacrifices to - morrow morning , first by asking me to breakfast , to meet Mr. Bell , and secondly , by being so kind as to order it at half - past nine , instead of at ten o’clock ? I have some letters and papers that I want to show to Miss Hale and Mr. Bell . ”
194002	194019	194021	194022	Captain Lennox	125	“ I hope Mr. Bell will make our house his own during his stay in London , ”
194024	194038	194021	194022	Captain Lennox	125	“ I am only so sorry we can not offer him a bedroom . ”
194039	194081	194083	194084	Mr. Bell	178	“ Thank you . I am much obliged to you . You would only think me a churl if you had , for I should decline it , I believe , in spite of all the temptations of such agreeable company , ”
194121	194178	194098	194098	he	178	“ I could n’t stand the restraints of such a proper - behaved and civil - spoken people as these are : it would be like meat without salt . I ’m thankful they have n’t a bed . And how well I rounded my sentence ! I ’m absolutely catching the trick of good manners . ”
194255	194284	194213	194213	she	123	“ You have known Miss Hale for a long time , I believe . How do you think her looking ? She strikes me as pale and ill . ”
194285	194324	194338	194339	Mr. Bell	178	“ I thought her looking remarkably well . Perhaps not when I first came — now I think of . But certainly , when she grew animated , she looked as well as ever I saw her do . ”
194325	194336	194338	194339	Mr. Bell	178	“ She has had a great deal to go through , ”
194341	194387	194338	194339	Mr. Bell	178	“ Yes ! I have been sorry to hear of all she has had to bear ; not merely the common and universal sorrow arising from death , but all the annoyance which her father ’s conduct must have caused her , and then — — ”
194388	194394	194396	194397	Mr. Bell	178	“ Her father ’s conduct ! ”
194405	194438	194396	194397	Mr. Bell	178	“ You must have heard some wrong statement . He behaved in the most conscientious manner . He showed more resolute strength than I should ever have given him credit for formerly . ”
194439	194630	194338	194339	Mr. Bell	178	“ Perhaps I have been wrongly informed . But I have been told , by his successor in the living — a clever sensible man , and a thoroughly active clergyman — that there was no call upon Mr. Hale to do what he did , relinquish the living , and throw himself and his family on the tender mercies of private teaching in a manufacturing town ; the bishop had offered him another living , it is true , but if he had come to entertain certain doubts , he could have remained where he was , and so had no occasion to resign . But the truth is , these country clergymen live such isolated lives — isolated , I mean , from all intercourse with men of equal cultivation with themselves , by whose minds they might regulate their own , and discover when they were going either too fast or too slow — that they are very apt to disturb themselves with imaginary doubts as to the articles of faith , and throw up certain opportunities of doing good for very uncertain fancies of their own . ”
194631	194654	194655	194656	Mr. Bell	178	“ I differ from you . I do not think they are very apt to do as my poor friend Hale did . ”
194661	194701	194703	194704	Mr. Lennox	135	“ Perhaps I used too general an expression in saying ‘ very apt . ’ But certainly , their lives are such as very often to produce either inordinate self - sufficiency , or a morbid state of conscience , ”
194709	194726	194728	194729	Mr. Bell	178	“ You do n’t meet with any self - sufficiency among the lawyers , for instance ? ”
194731	194744	194745	194745	He	135	“ And seldom , I imagine , any cases of morbid conscience . ”
194823	194925	194801	194801	he	135	“ To be sure , there is something fine in a man of Mr. Hale ’s age leaving his home of twenty years , and giving up all settled habits , for an idea which was probably erroneous — but that does not matter — an untangible thought . One can not help admiring him , with a mixture of pity in one ’s admiration , something like what one feels for Don Quixote . Such a gentleman as he was too ! I shall never forget the refined and simple hospitality he showed to me that last day at Helstone . ”
194964	195089	194961	194962	Mr. Bell	178	out—“Aye ! And you do n’t know Milton . Such a change from Helstone ! It is years since I have been at Helstone — but I ’ll answer for it , it is standing there yet — every stick and every stone as it has done for the last century , while Milton ! I go there every four or five years — and I was born there — yet I do assure you , I often lose my way — aye , among the very piles of warehouses that are built upon my father ’s orchard . Do we part here ? Well , good - night , sir ; I suppose we shall meet in Harley Street to - morrow morning . ”
195098	195139	195140	195142	W. S. LANDOR	248	“ Where are the sounds that swam along The buoyant air when I was young ; The last vibration now is o’er , And they who listened are no more ; Ah ! let me close my eyes and dream . ”
195608	195616	195618	195618	he	135	“ I had better not go on , ”
195625	195637	195618	195618	he	135	“ It was a foolish proposal of mine . Lieutenant Hale , ”
195662	195700	195618	195618	he	135	“ Lieutenant Hale is happy now ; more secure in fortune and future prospects than he could ever have been in the navy ; and has , doubtless , adopted his wife ’s country as his own . ”
195701	195706	195708	195708	Margaret	123	“ That is it , ”
195710	195721	195708	195708	Margaret	123	“ It seems so selfish in me to regret it , ”
195726	195741	195708	195708	Margaret	123	“ and yet he is lost to me , and I am so lonely . ”
195861	195864	195866	195866	he	178	“ Margaret ! ”
195875	195918	195866	195866	he	178	“ I am going down to Helstone to - morrow , to look at the old place . Would you like to come with me ? Or would it give you too much pain ? Speak out , do n’t be afraid . ”
195919	195925	195927	195927	she	123	“ Oh , Mr. Bell , ”
195947	195956	195958	195958	he	178	“ Come , come ; that ’s enough , ”
195964	196169	195958	195958	he	178	“ I suppose your aunt Shaw will trust you with me . We ’ll go to - morrow morning , and we shall get there about two o’clock , I fancy . We ’ll take a snack , and order dinner at the little inn — the Lennard Arms , it used to be — and go and get an appetite in the forest . Can you stand it , Margaret ? It will be a trial , I know , to both of us , but it will be a pleasure to me , at least . And there we ’ll dine — it will be but doe - venison , if we can get it at all — and then I ’ll take my nap , while you go out and see old friends . I ’ll give you back safe and sound , barring railway accidents , and I ’ll insure your life for a thousand pounds before starting , which may be some comfort to your relations ; but otherwise , I ’ll bring you back to Mrs. Shaw by lunch time on Friday . So , if you say yes , I ’ll just go upstairs and propose it . ”
196170	196186	196188	196188	Margaret	123	“ It ’s no use my trying to say how much I shall like it , ”
196194	196237	196188	196188	Margaret	123	“ Well , then , prove your gratitude by keeping those fountains of yours dry for the next two days . If you do n’t , I shall feel queer myself about the lachrymal ducts , and I do n’t like that . ”
196238	196246	196248	196248	Margaret	123	“ I wo n’t cry a drop , ”
196266	196283	196284	196284	Margaret	123	“ There ’s my good girl . Then we ’ll go upstairs and settle it all . ”
196382	196428	196376	196376	her	123	“ she was sure it had been a very kind thought of Mr. Bell ’s , and just what she herself had been wishing for Margaret , as giving her the very change which she required , after all the anxious time she had had . ”
196436	196501	196376	196376	her	123	“ So on those happy days of yore Oft as I dare to dwell once more , Still must I miss the friends so tried , Whom Death has severed from my side . But ever when true friendship binds , Spirit it is that spirit finds ; In spirit then our bliss we found , In spirit yet to them I ’m bound . ”
196927	196935	196924	196924	her	123	“ the days that are no more , ”
197298	197304	197306	197306	she	123	“ Why , bless me ! ”
197332	197340	197342	197342	she	123	“ It ’s Miss Hale , Jenny , ”
197355	197367	197342	197342	she	123	“ Come here , come directly , it ’s Miss Hale ! ”
197383	197418	197370	197370	she	123	“ And how are you all ? How ’s the Vicar and Miss Dixon ? The Vicar above all ! God bless him ! We ’ve never ceased to be sorry that he left . ”
197473	197476	197453	197453	she	402	“ Papa . ”
197477	197487	197489	197490	Mrs. Purkis	402	“ Surely , sir , it ’s never so ! ”
197508	197562	197494	197495	Mr. Bell	178	“ There was a gentleman here in the spring — might have been as long ago as last winter — who told us a deal of Mr. Hale and Miss Margaret ; and he said Mrs. Hale was gone , poor lady . But never a word of the Vicar ’s being ailing ! ”
197563	197570	197572	197573	Mr. Bell	178	“ It is so , however , ”
197575	197707	197572	197573	Mr. Bell	178	“ He died quite suddenly , when on a visit to me at Oxford . He was a good man , Mrs. Purkis , and there ’s many of us that might be thankful to have as calm an end as his . Come , Margaret , my dear ! Her father was my oldest friend , and she ’s my god - daughter , so I thought we would just come down together and see the old place ; and I know of old you can give us comfortable rooms and a capital dinner . You do n’t remember me I see , but my name is Bell , and once or twice when the parsonage has been full , I ’ve slept here , and tasted your good ale . ”
197708	197841	197494	197495	Mr. Bell	178	“ To be sure ; I ask your pardon ; but you see I was taken up with Miss Hale . Let me show you to a room , Miss Margaret , where you can take off your bonnet , and wash your face . It ’s only this very morning I plunged some fresh - gathered roses head downward in the water - jug , for thought I , perhaps some one will be coming , and there ’s nothing so sweet as spring - water scented by a musk rose or two . To think of the Vicar being dead ! Well , to be sure , we must all die ; only that gentleman said , he was quite picking up after his trouble about Mrs. Hale ’s death . ”
197842	197870	197572	197573	Mr. Bell	178	“ Come down to me , Mrs. Purkis , after you have attended to Miss Hale . I want to have a consultation with you about dinner . ”
197928	197931	197933	197934	Mrs. Purkis	402	“ Aye ! ”
197953	198282	197933	197934	Mrs. Purkis	402	“ times is changed , miss ; our new Vicar has seven children , and is building a nursery ready for more , just where the arbour and tool - house used to be in old times . And he has had new grates put in , and a plate - glass window in the drawing - room . He and his wife are stirring people , and have done a deal of good ; at least they say it ’s doing good ; if it were not , I should call it turning things upside down for very little purpose . The new Vicar is a teetotaller , miss , and a magistrate , and his wife has a deal of receipts for economical cooking , and is for making bread without yeast ; and they both talk so much , and both at a time , that they knock one down as it were , and it ’s not till they ’re gone , and one ’s a little at peace , that one can think that there were things one might have said on one ’s own side of the question . He ’ll be after the men ’s cans in the hay - field , and peeping in ; and then there ’ll be an ado because it ’s not ginger - beer , but I ca n’t help it . My mother and my grandmother before me sent good malt liquor to hay - makers , and took salts and senna when anything ailed them ; and I must e’en go on in their ways , though Mrs. Hepworth does want to give me comfits instead of medicine , which , as she says , is a deal pleasanter , only I ’ve no faith in it . But I must go , miss , though I ’m wanting to hear many a thing ; I ’ll come back to you before long . ”
198358	198366	198368	198369	Mr. Bell	178	“ Shall we go past the vicarage ? ”
198371	198395	198397	198397	Margaret	123	“ No , not yet . We will go this way , and make a round so as to come back by it , ”
198530	198541	198543	198543	Margaret	123	“ I did not think I had been so old , ”
198556	198559	198561	198562	Mr. Bell	178	“ Yes ! ”
198564	198625	198561	198562	Mr. Bell	178	“ It is the first changes among familiar things that make such a mystery of time to the young , afterwards we lose the sense of the mysterious . I take changes in all I see as a matter of course . The instability of all human things is familiar to me , to you it is new and oppressive . ”
198626	198636	198638	198638	Margaret	123	“ Let us go on to see little Susan , ”
198659	198692	198638	198638	Margaret	123	“ With all my heart , though I have not an idea who little Susan may be . But I have a kindness for all Susans , for simple Susan ’s sake . ”
198693	198752	198561	198562	Mr. Bell	178	“ My little Susan was disappointed when I left without wishing her good - bye ; and it has been on my conscience ever since , that I gave her pain which a little more exertion on my part might have prevented . But it is a long way . Are you sure you will not be tired ? ”
198753	198825	198561	198562	Mr. Bell	178	“ Quite sure . That is , if you do n’t walk so fast . You see , here there are no views that can give one an excuse for stopping to take breath . You would think it romantic to be walking with a person ‘ fat and scant o ’ breath ’ if I were Hamlet , Prince of Denmark . Have compassion on my infirmities for his sake . ”
198826	198845	198638	198638	Margaret	123	“ I will walk slower for your own sake . I like you twenty times better than Hamlet . ”
198846	198861	198561	198562	Mr. Bell	178	“ On the principle that a living ass is better than a dead lion ? ”
198862	198873	198561	198562	Mr. Bell	178	“ Perhaps so . I do n’t analyse my feelings . ”
198874	198907	198638	198638	Margaret	123	“ I am content to take your liking me , without examining too curiously into the materials it is made of . Only we need not walk at a snail ’s pace . ”
198908	198943	198561	198562	Mr. Bell	178	“ Very well . Walk at your own pace , and I will follow . Or stop still and meditate , like the Hamlet you compare yourself to , if I go too fast . ”
198944	198995	198561	198562	Mr. Bell	178	“ Thank you . But as my mother has not murdered my father , and afterwards married my uncle , I should n’t know what to think about , unless it were balancing the chances of our having a well - cooked dinner or not . What do you think ? ”
198996	199018	198638	198638	Margaret	123	“ I am in good hopes . She used to be considered a famous cook as far as Helstone opinion went . ”
199019	199034	198561	198562	Mr. Bell	178	“ But have you considered the distraction of mind produced by all this haymaking ? ”
199139	199147	199149	199149	Margaret	123	“ Oh ! it is quite right , ”
199151	199177	199149	199149	Margaret	123	“ I am very glad to hear it . I might have thought of it . Only she used to stop at home with you . ”
199178	199236	199238	199239	the mother	5788	“ Yes , she did ; and I miss her sadly . I used to teach her what little I knew at nights . It were not much to be sure . But she were getting such a handy girl , that I miss her sore . But she ’s a deal above me in learning now . ”
199242	199248	199238	199239	the mother	5788	“ I ’m all wrong , ”
199253	199323	199250	199251	Mr. Bell	178	“ Do n’t mind what I say . I ’m a hundred years behind the world . But I should say , that the child was getting a better and simpler , and more natural education stopping at home , and helping her mother , and learning to read a chapter in the New Testament every night by her side , than from all the schooling under the sun . ”
199356	199363	199349	199349	she	123	“ How is old Betty Barnes ? ”
199364	199370	199372	199373	the woman	3675	“ I do n’t know , ”
199377	199382	199372	199373	the woman	3675	“ We’se not friends . ”
199383	199387	199389	199389	Margaret	123	“ Why not ? ”
199403	199409	199389	199389	Margaret	123	“ She stole my cat . ”
199410	199418	199372	199373	the woman	3675	“ Did she know it was yours ? ”
199419	199429	199372	199373	the woman	3675	“ I do n’t know . I reckon not . ”
199430	199448	199389	199389	Margaret	123	“ Well ! could not you get it back again when you told her it was yours ? ”
199449	199458	199372	199373	the woman	3675	“ No ! for she ’d burnt it . ”
199459	199463	199466	199466	Margaret	123	“ Burnt it ! ”
199471	199475	199477	199478	the woman	3675	“ Roasted it ! ”
199708	199758	199701	199701	her	4696	“ it were very cruel for sure , and she should not like to do it ; but that there was nothing like it for giving a person what they wished for ; she had heard it all her life ; but it were very cruel for all that . ”
199773	199785	199787	199788	Mr. Bell	178	“ You are a good girl not to triumph over me , ”
199790	199798	199787	199788	Mr. Bell	178	“ How ? What do you mean ? ”
199799	199821	199701	199701	her	4696	“ I own I am wrong about schooling . Anything rather than have that child brought up in such practical paganism . ”
199822	199847	199787	199788	Mr. Bell	178	“ Oh ! I remember . Poor little Susan ! I must go and see her ; would you mind calling at the school ? ”
199848	199867	199868	199868	They	4697	“ Not a bit . I am curious to see something of the teaching she is to receive . ”
200109	200115	200125	200125	her	4710	“ It ’s Miss Hale . ”
200160	200197	200147	200148	The lady	1383	“ Your father , I presume , Miss Hale . I see it by the likeness . I am sure I am very glad to see you , sir , and so will the Vicar be . ”
200271	200305	200256	200257	Mr. Bell	178	“ Ah ! I see you would like to take a class , Miss Hale . I know it by myself . First class stand up for a parsing lesson with Miss Hale . ”
200499	200502	200488	200491	one of the girls	4724	“ a , ”
200509	200516	200518	200518	Margaret	123	“ A , an indefinite article , ”
200522	200528	200530	200531	the Vicar	8173	“ I beg your pardon , ”
200540	200559	200530	200531	the Vicar	8173	“ but we are taught by Mr. Milsome to call ‘ a ’ an — who can remember ? ”
200560	200565	200577	200577	Margaret	123	“ An adjective absolute , ”
200726	200728	200738	200738	she	123	“ improvements ”
200744	200746	200738	200738	she	123	“ alterations ”
200940	200943	200945	200946	Mrs. Hepworth	403	“ Ah ! ”
200948	200997	200945	200946	Mrs. Hepworth	403	“ you must excuse this untidiness , Miss Hale . When the nursery is finished , I shall insist upon a little order . We are building a nursery out of your room , I believe . How did you manage , Miss Hale , without a nursery ? ”
200998	201004	201006	201006	Margaret	123	“ We were but two , ”
201008	201017	201006	201006	Margaret	123	“ You have many children , I presume ? ”
201018	201073	200945	200946	Mrs. Hepworth	403	“ Seven . Look here ! we are throwing out a window to the road on this side . Mr. Hepworth is spending an immense deal of money on this house ; but really it was scarcely habitable when we came — for so large a family as ours I mean , of course . ”
201255	201258	201295	201296	Mrs. Hepworth	403	“ Jolly Forester ”
201361	201436	201437	201437	They	4754	“ Do n’t scold , Margaret . It was all because of you . If she had not shown you every change with such evident exultation in their superior sense , in perceiving what an improvement this and that would be , I could have behaved well . But if you must go on preaching , keep it till after dinner , when it will send me to sleep , and help my digestion . ”
201736	201798	201800	201801	Mr. Bell	178	“ Hallo ! Who ’s there ! Where are we ? Who ’s that,—Margaret ? Oh , now I remember all . I could not imagine what woman was sitting there in such a doleful attitude , with her hands clasped straight out upon her knees , and her face looking so steadfastly before her . What are you looking at ? ”
201813	201816	201818	201818	she	123	“ Nothing , ”
201837	201880	201818	201818	she	123	“ Nothing indeed ! A bleak back - ground of trees , some white linen hung out on the sweet - briar hedge , and a great waft of damp air . Shut the window , and come in and make tea . ”
201974	201993	201939	201939	she	123	introduce—“Mr . Bell , you remember what we were saying about Frederick last night , do n’t you ? ”
201994	202031	201939	201939	she	123	“ Last night . Where was I ? Oh , I remember ! Why , it seems a week ago . Yes , to be sure , I recollect we talked about him , poor fellow . ”
202032	202058	202062	202062	her	123	“ Yes — and do you remember that Mr. Lennox spoke about his having been in England about the time of dear mamma ’s death ? ”
202069	202081	202062	202062	her	123	“ I recollect . I had n’t heard of it before . ”
202082	202098	202062	202062	her	123	“ And I thought — I always thought that papa had told you about it . ”
202099	202113	202062	202062	her	123	“ No ! he never did . But what about it , Margaret ? ”
202114	202133	202135	202135	Margaret	123	“ I want to tell you of something I did that was very wrong , about that time , ”
202148	202154	202143	202143	her	123	“ I told a lie ! ”
202161	202357	202156	202156	her	123	“ True , that was bad I own ; not but what I have told a pretty round number in my life , not all in downright words , as I suppose you did , but in actions , or in some shabby circumlocutory way , leading people either to disbelieve the truth , or believe a falsehood . You know who is the father of lies , Margaret ? Well ! a great number of folk , thinking themselves very good , have odd sorts of connexion with lies , left - hand marriages , and second - cousins - once - removed . The tainting blood of falsehood runs through us all . I should have guessed you as far from it as most people . What ! crying , child ? Nay , now we ’ll not talk of it , if it ends in this way . I dare say you have been sorry for it , and that you wo n’t do it again , and it ’s long ago now , and in short I want you to be very cheerful , and not very sad , this evening . ”
202378	202428	202430	202430	she	123	“ Please , Mr. Bell , let me tell you about it — you could perhaps help me a little ; no , not help me , but if you knew the truth , perhaps you could put me to rights — that is not it , after all , ”
202454	202463	202465	202465	he	178	“ Tell me all about it , child , ”
202467	202767	202465	202465	he	178	“ It ’s a long story ; but when Fred came , mamma was very ill , and I was undone with anxiety , and afraid , too , that I might have drawn him into danger ; and we had an alarm just after her death , for Dixon met some one in Milton — a man called Leonards — who had known Fred , and who seemed to owe him a grudge , or at any rate to be tempted by the recollection of the reward offered for his apprehension ; and with this new fright , I thought I had better hurry off Fred to London , where , as you would understand from what we said the other night , he was to go to consult Mr. Lennox as to his chances if he stood trial . So we — that is , he and I,—went to the railway station ; it was one evening , and it was just getting rather dusk , but still light enough to recognize and be recognized , and we were too early , and went out to walk in a field just close by ; I was always in a panic about this Leonards , who was , I knew , somewhere in the neighbourhood ; and then , when we were in the field , the low red sunlight just in my face , some one came by on horseback in the road just below the field - style on which we stood.—I saw him look at me , but I did not know who it was at first , the sun was so in my eyes , but in an instant the dazzle went off , and I saw it was Mr. Thornton , and we bowed ”
202770	202778	202780	202781	Mr. Bell	178	“ And he saw Frederick of course , ”
202794	202861	202780	202781	Mr. Bell	178	“ Yes ; and then at the station a man came up — tipsy and reeling — and he tried to collar Fred , and over - balanced himself as Fred wrenched himself away , and fell over the hedge of the platform ; not far , not deep ; not above three feet ; but oh ! Mr. Bell , somehow that fall killed him ! ”
202862	202881	202465	202465	he	178	“ How awkward . It was this Leonards , I suppose . And how did Fred get off ? ”
202882	202913	202780	202781	Mr. Bell	178	“ Oh ! he went off immediately after the fall , which we never thought could have done the poor fellow any harm , it seemed so slight an injury . ”
202914	202922	202465	202465	he	178	“ Then he did not die directly ? ”
202923	202947	202949	202949	she	4768	“ No ! not for two or three days . And then — oh , Mr. Bell ! now comes the bad part , ”
202957	203083	202949	202949	she	4768	“ A police inspector came and taxed me with having been a companion of the young man , whose push or blow had occasioned Leonards ’ death ; that was a false accusation , you know , but we had not heard that Fred had sailed , he might still be in London and liable to be arrested on this false charge , and his identity with the Lieutenant Hale , accused of causing the mutiny , discovered , he might be shot ; all this flashed through my mind , and I said it was not me . I was not at the railway station that night . I knew nothing about it . I had no conscience or thought but to save Frederick . ”
203084	203115	202780	202781	Mr. Bell	178	“ I say it was right . I should have done the same . You forgot yourself in thought for another . I hope I should have done the same . ”
203116	203161	202949	202949	she	4768	“ No , you would not . It was wrong , disobedient , faithless . At that very time Fred was safely out of England , and in my blindness I forgot that there was another witness who could testify to my being there . ”
203162	203165	202949	202949	she	4768	“ Who ? ”
203166	203188	202780	202781	Mr. Bell	178	“ Mr. Thornton . You know he had seen me close to the station ; we had bowed to each other . ”
203189	203216	202949	202949	she	4768	“ Well ! he would know nothing of this riot , about the drunken fellow ’s death . I suppose the injury never came to anything . ”
203217	203278	203279	203279	She	4769	“ No ! the proceedings they had begun to talk about on the inquest were stopped . Mr. Thornton did know all about it . He was a magistrate , and he found out that it was not the fall that had caused the death . But not before he knew what I had said . Oh , Mr. Bell ! ”
203301	203321	203279	203279	She	4769	“ Did you have any explanation with him ? Did you ever tell him the strong , instinctive motive ? ”
203322	203340	203342	203342	she	4769	“ The instinctive want of faith , and clutching at a sin to keep myself from sinking , ”
203345	203452	203342	203342	she	4769	“ No ! How could I ? He knew nothing of Frederick . To put myself to rights in his good opinion , was I to tell him the secrets of our family , involving , as they seemed to do , the chances of poor Frederick ’s entire exculpation ? Fred ’s last words had been to enjoin me to keep his visit a secret from all . You see , papa never told , even you . No ! I could bear the shame — I thought I could at least . I did bear it . Mr. Thornton has never respected me since . ”
203453	203462	203464	203465	Mr. Bell	178	“ He respects you , I am sure , ”
203467	203497	203464	203465	Mr. Bell	178	“ To be sure it accounts a little for——. But he always speaks of you with regard and esteem , though now I understand certain reservations in his manner . ”
203528	203549	203525	203525	she	123	“ Will you tell me what you refer to about ‘ reservations ’ in his manner of speaking to me ? ”
203550	203634	203342	203342	she	4769	“ Oh ! simply he has annoyed me by not joining in my praises of you . Like an old fool , I thought that every one would have the same opinion as I had ; and he evidently could not agree with me . I was puzzled at the time . But he must be perplexed , if the affair has never been in the least explained . There was first your walking out with a young man in the dark — — ”
203635	203642	203644	203644	Margaret	123	“ But it was my brother ! ”
203648	203659	203644	203644	Margaret	123	“ True . But how was he to know that ? ”
203660	203674	203676	203676	Margaret	123	“ I do n’t know . I never thought anything of that kind , ”
203686	203708	203676	203676	Margaret	123	“ And perhaps he never would , but for the lie,—which , under the circumstances , I maintain , was necessary . ”
203709	203724	203644	203644	Margaret	123	“ It was not . I know it now . I bitterly repent it . ”
203740	203750	203733	203733	Margaret	123	“ I am not likely ever to see Mr. Thornton again,”—and
203755	203767	203769	203770	Mr. Bell	178	“ There are many things more unlikely , I should say , ”
203772	203806	203769	203770	Mr. Bell	178	“ But I believe I never shall . Still , somehow one does not like to have sunk so low in — in a friend ’s opinion as I have done in his . ”
203829	203949	203821	203822	Mr. Bell	178	“ And now that Frederick has given up all hope , and almost all wish of ever clearing himself , and returning to England , it would be only doing myself justice to have all this explained . If you please , and if you can , if there is a good opportunity , ( do n’t force an explanation upon him , pray , ) but if you can , will you tell him the whole circumstances , and tell him also that I gave you leave to do so , because I felt that for poor papa ’s sake I should not like to lose his respect , though we may never be likely to meet again ? ”
203950	203991	203815	203815	her	123	“ Certainly . I think he ought to know . I do not like you to rest even under a shadow of an impropriety ; he would not know what to think of seeing you alone with a young man . ”
203992	203997	203999	203999	Margaret	123	“ As for that , ”
204004	204106	203999	203999	Margaret	123	“ I hold it is ‘ Honi soit qui mal y pense , ’ Yet still I should choose to have it explained , if any natural opportunity for easy explanation occurs . But it is not to clear myself of any suspicion of improper conduct that I wish to have him told — if I thought that he had suspected me , I should not care for his good opinion — no ! it is that he may learn how I was tempted , and how I fell into the snare ; why I told that falsehood , in short . ”
204107	204127	203815	203815	her	123	“ Which I do n’t blame you for . It is no partiality of mine , I assure you . ”
204128	204199	203815	203815	her	123	“ What other people may think of the rightness or wrongness is nothing in comparison to my own deep knowledge , my innate conviction that it was wrong . But we will not talk of that any more , if you please . It is done — my sin is sinned . I have now to put it behind me , and be truthful for evermore , if I can . ”
204200	204374	203999	203999	Margaret	123	“ Very well . If you like to be uncomfortable and morbid , be so . I always keep my conscience as tight shut up as a jack - in - a - box , for when it jumps into existence it surprises me by its size . So I coax it down again , as the fisherman coaxed the genii . ‘ Wonderful , ’ says I , ‘ to think that you have been concealed so long , and in so small a compass , that I really did not know of your existence . Pray , sir , instead of growing larger and larger every instant , and bewildering me with your misty outlines , would you once more compress yourself into your former dimensions ? ’ And when I ’ve got him down , do n’t I clap the seal on the vase , and take good care how I open it again , and how I go against Solomon , wisest of men , who confined him there . ”
204505	204520	204521	204521	She	123	“ To turn and look back when thou hearest The sound of my name . ”
204749	204960	204962	204962	she	4777	“ I begin to understand now what heaven must be — and , oh ! the grandeur and repose of the words—‘The same yesterday , to - day , and for ever . ’ Everlasting ! ‘ From everlasting to everlasting , Thou art God . ’ That beautiful sky above me looks as though it could not change , and yet it will . I am so tired — so tired of being whirled on through all these phases of my life , in which nothing abides by me , no creature , no place ; it is like the circle in which the victims of earthly passion eddy continually . I am in the mood in which women of another religion take the veil . I seek heavenly steadfastness in earthly monotony . If I were a Roman Catholic and could deaden my heart , stun it with some great blow , I might become a nun . But I should pine after my kind ; no , not my kind , for love for my species could never fill my heart to the utter exclusion of love for individuals . Perhaps it ought to be so , perhaps not ; I can not decide to - night . ”
204992	204999	205001	205001	she	4777	“ After all it is right , ”
205015	205092	205108	205108	she	4777	“ If the world stood still , it would retrograde and become corrupt , if that is not Irish . Looking out of myself and my own painful sense of change , the progress of all around me is right and necessary . I must not think so much of how circumstances affect me myself , but how they affect others , if I wish to have a right judgment , or a hopeful trustful heart . ”
205118	205243	205115	205116	Mr. Bell	178	“ Ah , Missy ! you were up late last night , and so you ’re late this morning . Now I ’ve got a little piece of news for you . What do you think of an invitation to dinner ? a morning call , literally in the dewy morning . Why , I ’ve had the Vicar here already , on his way to the school . How much the desire of giving our hostess a teetotal lecture for the benefit of the hay - makers , had to do with his earliness , I do n’t know ; but here he was , when I came down just before nine ; and we are asked to dine there to - day . ”
205244	205256	205258	205258	Margaret	123	“ But Edith expects me back — I can not go , ”
205268	205299	205258	205258	Margaret	123	“ Yes ! I know ; so I told him . I thought you would not want to go . Still it is open , if you would like it . ”
205300	205305	205307	205307	Margaret	123	“ Oh , no ! ”
205309	205339	205307	205307	Margaret	123	“ Let us keep to our plan . Let us start at twelve . It is very good and kind of them ; but indeed I could not go . ”
205340	205356	205258	205258	Margaret	123	“ Very well . Do n’t fidget yourself , and I ’ll arrange it all . ”
205467	205525	205462	205462	she	123	“ And I too change perpetually — now this , now that — now disappointment and peevish because all is not exactly as I had pictured it , and now suddenly discovering that the reality is far more beautiful than I had imagined it . Oh , Helstone ! I shall never love any place like you . ”
205626	205667	205668	205670	MRS . BROWNING	162	“ Experience , like a pale musician , holds A dulcimer of patience in his hand ; Whence harmonies we can not understand , Of God ’s will in His worlds , the strain unfolds In sad , perplexed minors . ”
206836	206848	206811	206811	Dixon	186	“ She ’s a Papist , Miss , is n’t she ? ”
206849	206858	206860	206860	Margaret	123	“ I believe — oh yes , certainly ! ”
206872	206881	206860	206860	Margaret	123	“ And they live in a Popish country ? ”
206882	206885	206811	206811	Dixon	186	“ Yes . ”
206886	206928	206811	206811	Dixon	186	“ Then I ’m afraid I must say , that my soul is dearer to me than even Master Frederick , his own dear self . I should be in a perpetual terror , Miss , lest I should be converted . ”
206929	206932	206934	206934	Margaret	123	“ Oh , ”
206936	206996	206934	206934	Margaret	123	“ I do not know that I am going ; and if I go , I am not such a fine lady as to be unable to travel without you . No ! dear old Dixon , you shall have a long holiday , if we go . But I ’m afraid it is a long ‘ if . ’ ”
207045	207048	207043	207043	she	187	“ old , ”
207195	207208	207210	207210	Margaret	123	“ I fancy it was love that first predisposed him to conversion , ”
207214	207219	207221	207221	Dixon	186	“ Indeed , Miss ! ”
207223	207254	207221	207221	Dixon	186	“ well ! I can preserve myself from priests , and from churches ; but love steals in unawares ! I think it ’s as well I should not go . ”
207503	207525	207492	207492	herself	131	“ Oh dear , what shall I do with him ! Do , Margaret , please ring the bell for Hanley . ”
207803	207812	207800	207800	he	4817	“ And is that all you live for ? ”
208106	208113	208075	208075	her	123	“ NE’ER TO BE FOUND AGAIN . ”
208114	208147	208075	208075	her	123	“ My own , my father ’s friend ! I can not part with thee ! I ne’er have shown , thou ne’er hast known , How dear thou art to me . ”
208398	208412	208383	208383	he	135	“ You did not look pleased at what Shirley was saying at dinner . ”
208413	208425	208427	208427	Margaret	123	“ Did n’t I ? My face must be very expressive , ”
208429	208444	208427	208427	Margaret	123	“ It always was . It has not lost the trick of being eloquent . ”
208445	208451	208453	208453	Margaret	123	“ I did not like , ”
208457	208477	208453	208453	Margaret	123	“ his way of advocating what he knew to be wrong — so glaringly wrong — even in jest . ”
208478	208497	208427	208427	Margaret	123	“ But it was very clever . How every word told ! Did you remember the happy epithets ? ”
208498	208501	208427	208427	Margaret	123	“ Yes . ”
208502	208524	208453	208453	Margaret	123	“ And despise them , you would like to add . Pray do n’t scruple , though he is my friend . ”
208525	208536	208427	208427	Margaret	123	“ There ! that is the exact tone in you , that”—she
208584	208622	208572	208572	him	135	“ If my tones , or modes of thought , are what you dislike , will you do me the justice to tell me so , and so give me the chance of learning to please you . ”
208907	208968	208903	208903	Edith	131	“ Coming up to town ! Oh dear ! and I am so worn out by the heat that I do n’t believe I have strength enough in me for another dinner . Besides , everybody has left but our dear stupid selves , who ca n’t settle where to go to . There would be nobody to meet him . ”
208969	209059	208897	208897	her	123	“ I ’m sure he would much rather come and dine with us quite alone than with the most agreeable strangers you could pick up . Besides , if he is not well he wo n’t wish for invitations . I am glad he has owned it at last . I was sure he was ill from the whole tone of his letters , and yet he would not answer me when I asked him , and I had no third person to whom I could apply for news . ”
209060	209077	208903	208903	Edith	131	“ Oh ! he is not very ill , or he would not think of Spain . ”
209078	209084	208903	208903	Edith	131	“ He never mentions Spain . ”
209085	209112	208897	208897	her	123	“ No ! but his plan that is to be proposed evidently relates to that . But would you really go in such weather as this ? ”
209113	209170	208903	208903	Edith	131	“ Oh , it will get cooler every day . Yes ! Think of it . I am only afraid I have thought and wished too much — in that absorbing wilful way which is sure to be disappointed — or else gratified , to the letter , while in the spirit it gives no pleasure . ”
209171	209183	208903	208903	Edith	131	“ But that ’s superstitious , I ’m sure , Margaret . ”
209184	209248	208897	208897	her	123	“ No , I do n’t think it is . Only it ought to warn me , and check me from giving way to such passionate wishes . It is a sort of ‘ Give me children , or else I die . ’ I ’m afraid my cry is , ‘ Let me go to Cadiz , or else I die . ’ ”
209249	209291	208903	208903	Edith	131	“ My dear Margaret ! You ’ll be persuaded to stay there ; and then what shall I do ? Oh ! I wish I could find somebody for you to marry here , that I could be sure of you ! ”
209292	209298	208903	208903	Edith	131	“ I shall never marry . ”
209299	209341	208897	208897	her	123	“ Nonsense , and double nonsense ! Why , as Sholto says , you ’re such an attraction to the house , that he knows ever so many men who will be glad to visit here next year for your sake . ”
209348	209366	209342	209342	Margaret	123	“ Do you know , Edith , I sometimes think your Corfu life has taught you — — ”
209367	209370	208897	208897	her	123	“ Well ! ”
209371	209380	209381	209381	Edith	131	“ Just a shade or two of coarseness . ”
209795	209823	209783	209783	her	123	“ Oh , dear Margaret ! how shocking ! What are you doing ? Are you going out ? Sholto would telegraph or do anything you like . ”
209824	209892	209755	209755	her	123	“ I am going to Oxford . There is a train in half - an - hour . Dixon has offered to go with me , but I could have gone by myself . I must see him again . Besides , he may be better , and want some care . He has been like a father to me . Do n’t stop me , Edith . ”
209893	209963	209964	209964	Margaret	123	“ But I must . Mamma wo n’t like it at all . Come and ask her about it , Margaret . You do n’t know where you ’re going . I should not mind if he had a house of his own ; but in his Fellow ’s rooms ! Come to mamma , and do ask her before you go . It will not take a minute . ”
210466	210493	210494	210494	HOOD	360	“ And down the sunny beach she paces slowly , With many doubtful pauses by the way ; Grief hath an influence so hushed and holy . ”
210496	210503	210505	210505	Edith	131	“ Is not Margaret the heiress ? ”
210660	210712	210646	210646	she	131	“ I am right , and you are wrong , most noble Captain . Margaret has had a lawyer ’s letter , and she is residuary legatee — the legacies being about two thousand pounds , and the remainder about forty thousand , at the present value of property in Milton . ”
210713	210725	210646	210646	she	131	“ Indeed ! and how does she take her good fortune ? ”
210726	210796	210646	210646	she	131	“ Oh , it seems she knew she was to have it all along ; only she had no idea it was so much . She looks very white and pale , and says she ’s afraid of it ; but that ’s nonsense , you know , and will soon go off . I left mamma pouring congratulations down her throat , and stole away to tell you . ”
210884	210887	210889	210889	Edith	131	“ Henry , ”
210896	210915	210889	210889	Edith	131	“ do you know what I hope and expect all these long conversations with Margaret will end in ? ”
210916	210923	210925	210925	he	135	“ No , I do n’t , ”
210929	210939	210925	210925	he	135	“ And I desire you not to tell me . ”
210940	210963	210889	210889	Edith	131	“ Oh , very well ; then I need not tell Sholto not to ask Mr. Montagu so often to the house . ”
210964	210970	210972	210972	he	135	“ Just as you choose , ”
210977	211075	210972	210972	he	135	“ What you are thinking of may or may not happen ; but this time , before I commit myself , I will see my ground clear . Ask whom you choose . It may not be very civil , Edith , but if you meddle in it you will mar it . She has been very farouche with me for a long time ; and is only just beginning to thaw a little from her Zenobia ways . She has the making of a Cleopatra in her , if only she were a little more pagan . ”
211076	211081	211083	211083	Edith	131	“ For my part , ”
211089	211105	211083	211083	Edith	131	“ I am very glad she is a Christian . I know so very few ! ”
211795	211812	211814	211814	he	135	“ The sea has done Miss Hale an immense deal of good , I should fancy , ”
211830	211843	211814	211814	he	135	“ She looks ten years younger than she did in Harley Street . ”
211844	211853	211855	211855	Edith	131	“ That ’s the bonnet I got her ! ”
211859	211872	211855	211855	Edith	131	“ I knew it would suit her the moment I saw it . ”
211873	211879	211881	211882	Mr. Lennox	135	“ I beg your pardon , ”
211900	211961	211963	211963	his	135	“ But I believe I know the difference between the charms of a dress and the charms of a woman . No mere bonnet would have made Miss Hale ’s eyes so lustrous and yet so soft , or her lips so ripe and red — and her face altogether so full of peace and light.—She is like , and yet more,”—he
211964	211971	211963	211963	his	135	voice,—“like the Margaret Hale of Helstone . ”
212707	212716	212718	212718	Edith	131	“ Only do n’t be strong - minded , ”
212720	212783	212718	212718	Edith	131	“ Mamma wants you to have a footman of your own ; and I ’m sure you ’re very welcome , for they ’re great plagues . Only to please me , darling , do n’t go and have a strong mind ; it ’s the only thing I ask . Footman or no footman , do n’t be strong - minded . ”
212784	212844	212680	212680	she	123	“ Do n’t be afraid , Edith . I ’ll faint on your hands at the servants ’ dinner - time , the very first opportunity ; and then , what with Sholto playing with the fire , and the baby crying , you ’ll begin to wish for a strong - minded woman , equal to any emergency . ”
212845	212859	212718	212718	Edith	131	“ And you ’ll not grow too good to joke and be merry ? ”
212860	212881	212718	212718	Edith	131	“ Not I. I shall be merrier than I have ever been , now I have got my own way . ”
212882	212900	212680	212680	she	123	“ And you ’ll not go a figure , but let me buy your dresses for you ? ”
212901	212929	212718	212718	Edith	131	“ Indeed I mean to buy them for myself . You shall come with me if you like ; but no one can please me but myself . ”
212930	212983	212718	212718	Edith	131	“ Oh ! I was afraid you ’d dress in brown and dust - colour , not to show the dirt you ’ll pick up in all those places . I ’m glad you ’re going to keep one or two vanities , just by way of specimens of the old Adam . ”
212984	213033	213073	213073	They	4927	“ I am going to be just the same , Edith , if you and my aunt could but fancy so . Only as I have neither husband nor child to give me natural duties , I must make myself some , in addition to ordering my gowns . ”
213196	213216	213180	213180	people	617	“ Here we go up , up , up ; And here we go down , down , downee ! ”
213462	213476	213485	213485	they	4955	“ What news ? Who is gone ? How will it affect me ? ”
213540	213545	213547	213547	they	4955	“ Thornton is safe , ”
213549	213575	213547	213547	they	4955	“ His business is large — extending every year ; but such a head as he has , and so prudent with all his daring ! ”
213602	213650	213599	213599	he	5659	“ Thornton ’s business is large ; but he has spent his profits in extending it ; he has no capital laid by ; his machinery is new within these two years , and has cost him — we wo n’t say what!—a word to the wise ! ”
213875	213882	213884	213885	his mother	5657	“ Her merchants be like princes , ”
214077	214087	214061	214061	master	5403	“ we have all of us one human heart . ”
214895	214906	214908	214908	Higgins	202	“ Th ’ measter ’s a deal to potter him , ”
215009	215067	215069	215069	Higgins	202	“ Eh ! I reckon I know who ’d ha ’ been sorry for to see our measter sitting so like a piece o ’ grey calico ! Th ’ oud parson would ha ’ fretted his woman ’s heart out , if he ’d seen the woeful looks I have seen on our measter ’s face , ”
215084	215087	215089	215089	he	202	“ Measter , ”
215122	215133	215089	215089	he	202	“ Have yo ’ heerd aught of Miss Marget lately ? ”
215134	215139	215141	215142	Mr. Thornton	179	“ Miss — who ? ”
215144	215174	215141	215142	Mr. Thornton	179	“ Miss Marget — Miss Hale — th ’ oud parson ’s daughter — yo ’ known who I mean well enough — if yo’ll only think a bit — ”
215190	215194	215141	215142	Mr. Thornton	179	“ Oh yes ! ”
215247	215285	215238	215238	his	179	“ She ’s my landlord now , you know , Higgins . I hear of her through her agent here , every now and then . She ’s well and among friends — thank you , Higgins . ”
215287	215290	215238	215238	his	179	“ thank you ”
215341	215351	215329	215329	he	179	“ And she ’s not getten married , measter ? ”
215352	215356	215418	215418	he	179	“ Not yet . ”
215364	215383	215418	215418	he	179	“ There is some talk of it , as I understand , with a connection of the family . ”
215384	215399	215329	215329	he	179	“ Then she ’ll not be for coming to Milton again , I reckon . ”
215400	215403	215329	215329	he	179	“ No ! ”
215404	215411	215418	215418	he	179	“ Stop a minute , measter . ”
215421	215429	215418	215418	he	179	“ Is th ’ young gentleman cleared ? ”
215454	215481	215418	215418	he	179	“ Th ’ young gentleman , I mean — Master Frederick , they ca’ed him — her brother as was over here , yo ’ known . ”
215482	215486	215329	215329	he	179	“ Over here . ”
215487	215540	215329	215329	he	179	“ Ay , to be sure , at th ’ missus ’s death . Yo ’ need na be feared of my telling ; for Mary and me , we knowed it all along , only we held our peace , for we got it through Mary working in th ’ house . ”
215541	215552	215418	215418	he	179	“ And he was over . It was her brother . ”
215553	215582	215329	215329	he	179	“ Sure enough , and I reckoned yo ’ knowed it , or I ’d never ha ’ let on . Yo ’ knowed she had a brother ? ”
215583	215602	215329	215329	he	179	“ Yes , I know all about him . And he was over at Mrs. Hale ’s death ? ”
215603	215643	215418	215418	he	179	“ Nay ! I ’m not going for to tell more . I ’ve maybe getten them into mischief already , for they kept it very close . I nobbut wanted to know if they ’d getten him cleared ? ”
215644	215673	215674	215674	He	5013	“ Not that I know of . I know nothing . I only hear of Miss Hale , now , as my landlord , and through her lawyer . ”
215704	215710	215712	215713	Mr. Thornton	179	“ It was her brother , ”
215717	215763	215712	215713	Mr. Thornton	179	“ I am glad . I may never see her again ; but it is a comfort — a relief — to know that much . I knew she could not be unmaidenly ; and yet I yearned for conviction . Now I am glad ! ”
216002	216012	215988	215988	Their	5022	“ Mother ! why are you not in bed ? ”
216013	216017	216019	216019	she	5657	“ Son John , ”
216021	216062	216019	216019	she	5657	“ do you think I can sleep with an easy mind , while you keep awake full of care ? You have not told me what your trouble is ; but sore trouble you have had these many days past . ”
216063	216068	215988	215988	Their	5022	“ Trade is bad . ”
216069	216075	215988	215988	Their	5022	“ And you dread — — ”
216076	216081	216083	216083	he	5013	“ I dread nothing , ”
216095	216111	216083	216083	he	5013	“ I know that no man will suffer by me . That was my anxiety . ”
216112	216128	216129	216129	her	5657	“ But how do you stand ? Shall you — will it be a failure ? ”
216138	216165	216129	216129	her	5657	“ Not a failure . I must give up business , but I pay all men . I might redeem myself — I am sorely tempted — ”
216166	216188	216083	216083	he	5013	“ How ? Oh , John ! keep up your name — try all risks for that . How redeem it ? ”
216189	216234	216129	216129	her	5657	“ By a speculation offered to me , but full of risk ; but , if successful , placing me high above water - mark , so that no one need ever know the strait I am in . Still , if it fails — ”
216235	216241	216243	216243	she	5657	“ And if it fails , ”
216274	216283	216285	216285	he	5023	“ Honest men are ruined by a rogue , ”
216288	216343	216285	216285	he	5023	“ As I stand now , my creditors ’ money is safe — every farthing of it ; but I do n’t know where to find my own — it may be all gone , and I penniless at this moment . Therefore , it is my creditors ’ money that I should risk . ”
216344	216382	216255	216255	her	5657	“ But if it succeeded , they need never know . Is it so desperate a speculation ? I am sure it is not , or you would never have thought of it . If it succeeded — ”
216383	216400	216255	216255	her	5657	“ I should be a rich man , and my peace of conscience would be gone ! ”
216401	216411	216285	216285	he	5023	“ Why ! You would have injured no one . ”
216412	216454	216255	216255	her	5657	“ No ; but I should have run the risk of ruining many for my own paltry aggrandisement . Mother , I have decided ! You wo n’t much grieve over our leaving this house , shall you , dear mother ? ”
216455	216477	216255	216255	her	5657	“ No ! but to have you other than what you are will break my heart . What can you do ? ”
216478	216558	216559	216559	He	5024	“ Be always the same John Thornton in whatever circumstances ; endeavouring to do right , and making great blunders ; and then trying to be brave in setting to afresh . But it is hard , mother . I have worked and planned . I have discovered new powers in my situation too late — and now all is over . I am too old to begin again with the same heart . It is hard , mother . ”
216573	216579	216581	216581	she	5025	“ I ca n’t think , ”
216590	216671	216581	216581	she	5025	“ how it comes about . Here is my boy — good son , just man , tender heart — and he fails in all he sets his mind upon : he finds a woman to love , and she cares no more for his affection than if he had been a common man ; he labours , and his labour comes to nought . Other people grow rich , and hold their paltry names high and dry above shame . ”
216672	216678	216680	216680	he	5026	“ Shame never touched me , ”
216692	216746	216747	216747	She	5025	“ I sometimes have wondered where justice was gone to , and now I do n’t believe there is such a thing in the world — now you are come to this ; you , my own John Thornton , though you and I may be beggars together — my own dear son ! ”
216760	216763	216765	216765	he	5026	“ Mother ! ”
216774	216790	216765	216765	he	5026	“ who has sent me my lot in life , both of good and evil ? ”
216807	216810	216811	216811	he	5026	“ Mother , ”
216822	216984	216811	216811	he	5026	“ I , too , have been rebellious ; but I ’m striving to be so no longer . Help me , as you helped me when I was a child . Then you said many good words — when my father died , and we were sometimes sorely short of comforts — which we shall never be now ; you said brave , noble , trustful words then , mother , which I have never forgotten , though they may have lain dormant . Speak to me again in the old way , mother . Do not let us have to think that the world has too much hardened our hearts . If you would say the old good words , it would make me feel something of the pious simplicity of my childhood . I say them to myself , but they would come differently from you , remembering all the cares and trials you have had to bear . ”
216985	216992	216994	216994	she	5027	“ I have had a many , ”
216998	217047	216994	216994	she	5027	“ but none so sore as this . To see you cast down from your rightful place ! I could say it for myself , John , but not for you . Not for you ! God has seen fit to be very hard on you , very . ”
217105	217110	217111	217111	she	5027	“ Oh , John ! ”
217716	217764	217710	217711	CHAPTER LI	428	“ Bear up , brave heart ! we will be calm and strong ; Sure , we can master eyes , or cheek , or tongue , Nor let the smallest tell - tale sign appear She ever was , and is , and will be dear . ”
217831	217865	217825	217825	Edith	131	“ Oh , Dixon ! not those horrid blue flowers to that dead gold - coloured gown . What taste ! Wait a minute , and I will bring you some pomegranate blossoms . ”
217866	217893	217825	217825	Edith	131	“ It ’s not a dead gold - colour ma’am . It ’s a straw - colour . And blue always goes with straw - colour . ”
217911	217917	217919	217919	Edith	131	“ Where is Miss Hale ? ”
217933	217939	217940	217940	she	131	“ I ca n’t think , ”
217946	218009	217940	217940	she	131	“ how my aunt allowed her to get into such rambling habits in Milton ! I ’m sure I ’m always expecting to hear of her having met with something horrible among all those wretched places she pokes herself into . I should never dare to go down some of those streets without a servant . They ’re not fit for ladies . ”
218025	218077	218020	218020	she	186	“ It ’s no wonder to my mind , when I hear ladies talk such a deal about ladies — and when they ’re such fearful , delicate , dainty ladies too — I say it ’s no wonder to me that there are no longer any saints on earth — — ”
218078	218205	217940	217940	she	131	“ Oh , Margaret ! here you are ! I have been so wanting you . But how your cheeks are flushed with the heat , poor child ! But only think what that tiresome Henry has done ; really , he exceeds brother - in - law ’s limits . Just when my party was made up so beautifully — fitted in so precisely for Mr. Colthurst — there has Henry come , with an apology it is true , and making use of your name for an excuse , and asked me if he may bring that Mr. Thornton of Milton — your tenant , you know — who is in London about some law business . It will spoil my number , quite . ”
218206	218219	218221	218221	Margaret	123	“ I do n’t mind dinner . I do n’t want any , ”
218228	218264	218221	218221	Margaret	123	“ Dixon can get me a cup of tea here , and I will be in the drawing - room by the time you come up . I shall really be glad to lie down . ”
218265	218474	217940	217940	she	131	“ No , no ! that will never do . You do look wretchedly white , to be sure ; but that is just the heat , and we ca n’t do without you possibly . ( Those flowers a little lower , Dixon . They look glorious flames , Margaret , in your black hair . ) You know we planned you to talk about Milton to Mr. Colthurst . Oh ! to be sure ! and this man comes from Milton . I believe it will be capital , after all . Mr. Colthurst can pump him well on all the subjects in which he is interested , and it will be great fun to trace out your experiences , and this Mr. Thornton ’s wisdom , in Mr. Colthurst ’s next speech in the House . Really , I think it is a happy hit of Henry ’s . I asked him if he was a man one would be ashamed of ; and he replied , ‘ Not if you ’ve any sense in you , my little sister . ’ So I suppose he is able to sound his h ’s , which is not a common Darkshire accomplishment — eh , Margaret ? ”
218475	218499	218501	218501	Margaret	123	“ Mr. Lennox did not say why Mr. Thornton was come up to town ? Was it law business connected with the property ? ”
218508	218577	218501	218501	Margaret	123	“ Oh ! he ’s failed , or something of the kind , that Henry told you of that day you had such a headache — what was it ? ( There , that ’s capital , Dixon . Miss Hale does us credit , does she not ? ) I wish I was as tall as a queen , and as brown as a gipsy , Margaret . ”
218578	218584	217940	217940	she	131	“ But about Mr. Thornton ? ”
218585	218685	218501	218501	Margaret	123	“ Oh ! I really have such a terrible head for law business . Henry will like nothing better than to tell you all about it . I know the impression he made upon me was , that Mr. Thornton is very badly off , and a very respectable man , and that I ’m to be very civil to him : and as I did not know how , I came to you to ask you to help me . And now come down with me , and rest on the sofa for a quarter of an hour . ”
218719	218837	218838	218838	He	179	“ He came up about this sub - letting the property — Marlborough Mills , and the house and premises adjoining , I mean . He is unable to keep it on ; and there are deeds and leases to be looked over and agreements to be drawn up . I hope Edith will receive him properly ; but she was rather put out , as I could see , by the liberty I had taken in begging for an invitation for him . But I thought you would like to have some attention shown him : and one would be particularly scrupulous in paying every respect to a man who is going down in the world . ”
219142	219150	219152	219153	Mr. Lennox	135	“ You think Miss Hale looking well , ”
219155	219241	219152	219153	Mr. Lennox	135	“ do n’t you ? Milton did n’t agree with her , I imagine ; for when she first came to London , I thought I had never seen any one so much changed . To - night she is looking radiant . But she is much stronger . Last autumn she was fatigued with a walk of a couple of miles . On Friday evening we walked up to Hampstead and back . Yet on Saturday she looked as well as she does now . ”
219242	219245	219152	219153	Mr. Lennox	135	“ We ! ”
219315	219318	219314	219314	his	429	“ Indeed ! ”
219627	219687	219613	219614	Mr. Lennox	135	“ I really think Edith owes me thanks for my contribution to her party . You ’ve no idea what an agreeable , sensible fellow this tenant of yours is . He has been the very man to give Colthurst all the facts he wanted coaching in . I ca n’t conceive how he contrived to mismanage his affairs . ”
219688	219699	219701	219701	Margaret	123	“ With his powers and opportunities you would have succeeded , ”
219758	219798	219752	219753	Mr. Colthurst	429	“ I assure you , I heard it spoken of with great interest — curiosity as to its result , perhaps I should rather say . I heard your name frequently mentioned during my short stay in the neighbourhood . ”
219816	219927	219811	219812	Mr. Thornton	179	“ I have not the elements for popularity — if they spoke of me in that way , they were mistaken . I fall slowly into new projects ; and I find it difficult to let myself be known , even by those whom I desire to know , and with whom I would fain have no reserve . Yet , even with all these drawbacks , I felt that I was on the right path , and that , starting from a kind of friendship with one , I was becoming acquainted with many . The advantages were mutual : we were both unconsciously and consciously teaching each other . ”
219928	219946	219969	219969	he	135	“ You say ‘ were . ’ I trust you are intending to pursue the same course ? ”
219947	219953	219955	219956	Henry Lennox	135	“ I must stop Colthurst , ”
220035	220191	220027	220028	Mr. Colthurst	429	“ I have been unsuccessful in business , and have had to give up my position as a master . I am on the look - out for a situation in Milton , where I may meet with employment under some one who will be willing to let me go along my own way in such matters as these . I can depend upon myself for having no go - ahead theories that I would rashly bring into practice . My only wish is to have the opportunity of cultivating some intercourse with the hands beyond the mere ‘ cash nexus . ’ But it might be the point Archimedes sought from which to move the earth , to judge by the importance attached to it by some of our manufacturers , who shake their heads and look grave as soon as I name the one or two experiments that I should like to try . ”
220192	220202	220204	220205	Mr. Colthurst	429	“ You call them ‘ experiments ’ I notice , ”
220217	220542	220204	220205	Mr. Colthurst	429	“ Because I believe them to be such . I am not sure of the consequences that may result from them . But I am sure they ought to be tried . I have arrived at the conviction that no mere institutions , however wise , and however much thought may have been required to organise and arrange them , can attach class to class as they should be attached , unless the working out of such institutions bring the individuals of the different classes into actual personal contact . Such intercourse is the very breath of life . A working man can hardly be made to feel and know how much his employer may have laboured in his study at plans for the benefit of his workpeople . A complete plan emerges like a piece of machinery , apparently fitted for every emergency . But the hands accept it as they do machinery , without understanding the intense mental labour and forethought required to bring it to such perfection . But I would take an idea , the working out of which would necessitate personal intercourse ; it might not go well at first , but at every hitch interest would be felt by an increasing number of men , and at last its success in working come to be desired by all , as all had borne a part in the formation of the plan ; and even then I am sure that it would lose its vitality , cease to be living , as soon as it was no longer carried on by that sort of common interest which invariably makes people find means and ways of seeing each other , and becoming acquainted with each others ’ characters and persons , and even tricks of temper and modes of speech . We should understand each other better , and I ’ll venture to say we should like each other more . ”
220543	220554	220629	220629	he	5070	“ And you think they may prevent recurrence of strikes ? ”
220555	220617	220629	220629	he	5070	“ Not at all . My utmost expectation only goes as far as this — that they may render strikes not the bitter , venomous sources of hatred they have hitherto been . A more hopeful man might imagine that a closer and more genial intercourse between classes might do away with strikes . But I am not a hopeful man . ”
220658	220713	220629	220629	he	5070	“ Miss Hale , I had a round - robin from some of my men — I suspect in Higgins ’ handwriting — stating their wish to work for me , if ever I was in a position to employ men again on my own behalf . That was good , was n’t it ? ”
220714	220726	220728	220728	Margaret	123	“ Yes . Just right . I am glad of it , ”
220777	220785	220786	220786	he	5070	“ I knew you would like it , ”
220802	220806	220797	220797	he	5070	“ good night . ”
220831	220849	220814	220814	Margaret	123	“ Can I speak to you to - morrow ? I want your help about — something . ”
220850	220884	220885	220885	His	5070	“ Certainly . I will come at whatever time you name . You can not give me a greater pleasure than by making me of any use . At eleven ? Very well . ”

221039	221044	221046	221046	she	131	“ Well , Henry ? ”
221054	221057	221059	221059	he	5070	“ Well ! ”
221064	221070	221059	221059	he	5070	“ Come in to lunch ! ”
221071	221090	221021	221022	a man	940	“ No , thank you , I ca n’t . I ’ve lost too much time here already . ”
221091	221099	221101	221101	Edith	131	“ Then it ’s not all settled ? ”
221105	221144	221101	221101	Edith	131	“ No ! not at all . It never will be settled , if the ‘ it ’ is what I conjecture you mean . That will never be , Edith , so give up thinking about it . ”
221145	221156	221158	221158	Edith	131	“ But it would be so nice for us all , ”
221160	221195	221158	221158	Edith	131	“ I should always feel comfortable about the children , if I had Margaret settled down near to me . As it is , I am always afraid of her going off to Cadiz . ”
221196	221243	221021	221022	a man	940	“ I will try , when I marry , to look out for a young lady who has a knowledge of the management of children . That is all I can do . Miss Hale will not have me . And I shall not ask her . ”
221244	221253	221021	221022	a man	940	“ Then what have you been talking about ? ”
221254	221273	221158	221158	Edith	131	“ A thousand things you would not understand : Investments , and leases , and value of land . ”
221274	221305	221021	221022	a man	940	“ Oh , go away if that ’s all . You and she will be unbearably stupid , if you ’ve been talking all this time about such weary things . ”
221306	221334	221021	221022	a man	940	“ Very well . I ’m coming again to - morrow , and bringing Mr. Thornton with me , to have some more talk with Miss Hale . ”
221335	221347	221158	221158	Edith	131	“ Mr. Thornton ! What has he to do with it ? ”
221348	221356	221358	221359	Mr. Lennox	135	“ He is Miss Hale ’s tenant , ”
221364	221374	221358	221359	Mr. Lennox	135	“ And he wishes to give up his lease . ”
221375	221394	221158	221158	Edith	131	“ Oh ! very well . I ca n’t understand details , so do n’t give them me . ”
221395	221461	221358	221359	Mr. Lennox	135	“ The only detail I want you to understand is , to let us have the back drawing - room undisturbed , as it was to - day . In general , the children and servants are so in and out , that I can never get any business satisfactorily explained ; and the arrangements we have to make to - morrow are of importance . ”
221511	221538	221507	221507	She	123	“ I am so sorry Mr. Lennox is not here,—he could have done it so much better than I can . He is my adviser in this ”
221541	221568	221507	221507	She	123	“ I am sorry that I came , if it troubles you . Shall I go to Mr. Lennox ’s chambers and try and find him ? ”
221569	221608	221507	221507	She	123	“ No , thank you . I wanted to tell you , how grieved I was to find that I am to lose you as a tenant . But , Mr. Lennox says , things are sure to brighten ”
221611	221619	221621	221622	Mr. Thornton	179	“ Mr. Lennox knows little about it , ”
221625	221728	221621	221622	Mr. Thornton	179	“ Happy and fortunate in all a man cares for , he does not understand what it is to find oneself no longer young — yet thrown back to the starting - point which requires the hopeful energy of youth — to feel one half of life gone , and nothing done — nothing remaining of wasted opportunity , but the bitter recollection that it has been . Miss Hale , I would rather not hear Mr. Lennox ’s opinion of my affairs . Those who are happy and successful themselves are too apt to make light of the misfortunes of others . ”
221729	221734	221736	221736	Margaret	123	“ You are unjust , ”
221740	221780	221736	221736	Margaret	123	“ Mr. Lennox has only spoken of the great probability which he believes there to be of your redeeming — your more than redeeming what you have lost — don’t speak till I have ended — pray do n’t . ”
221807	221887	221787	221787	she	123	“ Oh ! here it is ! and — he drew me out a proposal — I wish he was here to explain it — showing that if you would take some money of mine , eighteen hundred and fifty - seven pounds , lying just at this moment unused in the bank , and bringing me in only two and a half per cent.—you could pay me much better interest , and might go on working Marlborough Mills . ”
221992	221995	221988	221988	he	179	“ Margaret ! ”
222036	222039	222024	222024	he	179	“ Margaret ! ”
222093	222124	222067	222067	He	179	“ Take care.—If you do not speak — I shall claim you as my own in some strange presumptuous way.—Send me away at once , if I must go;—Margaret ! — ”
222203	222215	222196	222196	she	123	“ Oh , Mr. Thornton , I am not good enough ! ”
222216	222231	222196	222196	she	123	“ Not good enough ! Do n’t mock my own deep feeling of unworthiness . ”
222264	222271	222272	222272	he	179	“ Do you remember , love ? ”
222275	222288	222272	222272	he	179	“ And how I requited you with my insolence the next day ? ”
222289	222301	222322	222322	him	179	“ I remember how wrongly I spoke to you,—that is all . ”
222302	222318	222319	222319	She	123	“ Look here ! Lift up your head . I have something to show you ! ”
222329	222336	222337	222337	he	179	“ Do you know these roses ? ”
222356	222359	222360	222360	she	123	“ No ! ”
222367	222375	222360	222360	she	123	“ Did I give them to you ? ”
222376	222394	222395	222395	She	123	“ No ! Vanity ; you did not . You may have worn sister roses very probably . ”
222414	222445	222406	222406	she	123	“ They are from Helstone , are they not ? I know the deep indentations round the leaves . Oh ! have you been there ? When were you there ? ”
222446	222489	222411	222411	she	123	“ I wanted to see the place where Margaret grew to what she is , even at the worst time of all , when I had no hope of ever calling her mine . I went there on my return from Havre . ”
222490	222498	222499	222499	she	123	“ You must give them to me , ”
222514	222526	222499	222499	she	123	“ Very well . Only you must pay me for them ! ”
222527	222536	222537	222537	she	123	“ How shall I ever tell Aunt Shaw ? ”
222547	222554	222537	222537	she	123	“ Let me speak to her . ”
222555	222569	222499	222499	she	123	“ Oh , no ! I owe to her,—but what will she say ? ”
222570	222586	222499	222499	she	123	“ I can guess . Her first exclamation will be , ‘ That man ! ’ ”
222587	222590	222592	222592	Margaret	123	“ Hush ! ”
222594	222616	222592	222592	Margaret	123	“ or I shall try and show you your mother ’s indignant tones as she says , ‘ That woman ! ’ ”
